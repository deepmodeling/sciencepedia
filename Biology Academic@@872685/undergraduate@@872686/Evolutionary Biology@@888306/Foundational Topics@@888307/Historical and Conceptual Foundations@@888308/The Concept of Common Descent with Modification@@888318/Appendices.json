This first practice presents a classic thought experiment to help you apply its principles in a predictive way. By considering a hypothetical population of fish moved to a new environment with a different food source, you can practice connecting a specific ecological pressure to the likely adaptive changes in morphology over many generations [@problem_id:1969759]. This exercise is fundamental to developing an intuition for how environmental challenges shape the evolution of a lineage.", "problem": "A population of fish, a species known as the \"Slender-jawed Minnow\" (*Leptorhamphus gracilis*), primarily feeds on soft-bodied aquatic insect larvae in its native river habitat. This feeding strategy is supported by their long, delicate jaws and fine, pointed teeth, which are efficient for grasping small, soft prey from the water column. A research team translocates a large, genetically diverse group of these minnows to a newly formed, isolated volcanic crater lake. In this new environment, the only abundant and viable food source is a species of small, hard-shelled snail that lives on the lakebed rocks.\n\nAssume the following:\n1. The initial minnow population exhibits natural, heritable variation in several morphological traits, including the robustness of the jaw bones, the size of the jaw-closing muscle (adductor mandibulae), and the shape of the teeth (ranging from pointed to more rounded and robust).\n2. The minnows are the only predators of the snails in the lake, and the snails are the only food source for the minnows.\n3. The population survives and reproduces for many generations in this new lake.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions most accurately predicts the evolutionary changes that would be observed in the minnow population over a period of many generations?\n\nA. The population will show a directional shift towards individuals possessing, on average, shorter, more robust jaws, larger adductor mandibulae muscles, and thicker, more molar-like teeth.\n\nB. Individual fish will strengthen their jaws by attempting to crush the hard snail shells. These acquired, more powerful jaws will be directly passed on to their offspring, leading to a stronger-jawed population.\n\nC. The population's jaw morphology will not change, as the traits of a species are fixed. The fish will instead evolve new digestive enzymes better suited for breaking down snail tissue.\n\nD. The average jaw morphology of the population will change unpredictably from one generation to the next due to random genetic mutations and genetic drift, with no clear directional trend.\n\nE. The population will evolve more slender and elongated jaws to improve their ability to probe crevices for snails, as crushing force is less important than the ability to reach the prey.", "solution": "We apply the standard logic of adaptive evolution by natural selection:\n\n1) Preconditions for evolution by natural selection are satisfied. Assumption 1 states there is heritable variation in jaw robustness, adductor mandibulae size, and tooth shape; thus for each trait $z$ (e.g., jaw robustness), the narrow-sense heritability satisfies $h^2 > 0$. Assumption 2 ensures a consistent and strong ecological pressure: the only available food is hard-shelled snails, and minnows must exploit them to survive. Assumption 3 provides many generations, allowing cumulative evolutionary change.\n\n2) Directional selection on feeding performance is expected. In a hard-prey environment, fitness increases with effective shell-crushing performance. Biomechanical principles imply:\n- Bite force scales with muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage. For a simple lever model of the jaw, bite force is proportional to muscle force times the in-lever to out-lever ratio; shorter, more robust jaws (reduced out-lever) and larger adductor muscles increase bite force and reduce risk of structural failure under load.\n- Tooth morphology under hard-prey feeding experiences high compressive and bending stresses; thicker, more molar-like teeth distribute stress and resist fracture better than fine, pointed teeth.\n\nHence, the fitness function $w(z)$ increases monotonically with greater jaw robustness, larger adductor muscles, and more molariform teeth. Therefore, the selection differential $S=\\bar{z}_{\\text{selected}}-\\bar{z}$ is positive for these traits.\n\n3) Predicted evolutionary response follows the breeder’s equation. For each trait,\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{z} = h^{2} S,\n$$\nso with $h^2 > 0$ and $S>0$, we obtain $\\Delta \\bar{z} > 0$ in the direction of increased crushing ability. Across many generations with a persistent environment, this yields a directional shift in the population means toward shorter, more robust jaws, larger adductor mandibulae, and thicker, molar-like teeth.\n\n4) Evaluation of the options:\n- A: Matches the predicted directional selection on crushing performance, consistent with biomechanics and the breeder’s equation. This is the expected outcome.\n- B: Invokes inheritance of acquired characteristics. Use-induced changes within an individual are not directly inherited; evolutionary change arises via differential survival and reproduction changing allele frequencies, not Lamarckian mechanisms. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n- C: Claims traits are fixed and suggests enzyme evolution instead. Traits are not fixed given standing heritable variation; strong, consistent selection on feeding mechanics makes morphological evolution expected. While other adaptations could occur, the statement that morphology will not change is contradicted by the conditions and quantitative genetic prediction. Hence, C is incorrect.\n- D: Predicts no directional trend due to drift. With strong, consistent selection and a large, genetically diverse founding population, selection overrides drift for these fitness-related traits, producing a predictable directional trend. D is incorrect.\n- E: Predicts more slender, elongated jaws for probing. Probing is not the limiting factor; crushing hard shells is. Slender jaws reduce mechanical advantage and structural robustness, opposing the needed increase in bite force and durability. E contradicts the biomechanical requirements and expected selection gradient.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate prediction is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1969759"}, {"introduction": "Common descent predicts that closely related species will share similar traits inherited from their common ancestor, known as homologous structures. However, not all similarities are evidence of a recent shared ancestor. This exercise uses the real-world example of saber-toothed mammals to illustrate the crucial concept of convergent evolution, where similar ecological niches drive the independent evolution of analogous structures in distantly related lineages [@problem_id:1969741]. Mastering the distinction between homology and analogy is essential for correctly interpreting the patterns of evolution.", "problem": "The evolutionary history of mammals is rich with diverse forms. *Smilodon*, the famous saber-toothed cat, was a placental mammal (Eutheria) that lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch. Paleontologists have also discovered fossils of *Thylacosmilus*, an apex predator from the Miocene epoch in South America. *Thylacosmilus* was a metatherian, the group that includes modern marsupials, and remarkably, it also possessed a pair of enormous, saber-like canine teeth. The last common ancestor of placental and marsupial mammals lived during the Mesozoic era, over 160 million years ago, and fossil evidence indicates this ancestor was a small, shrew-like animal that lacked any form of saber-teeth. Both *Smilodon* and *Thylacosmilus* occupied a similar ecological niche as powerful predators of large herbivores in their respective environments and time periods.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements provides the most accurate evolutionary explanation for the presence of saber-teeth in both *Smilodon* and *Thylacosmilus*?\n\nA. The saber-teeth are homologous structures that were inherited from the shrew-like common ancestor, but the genes for them remained dormant for over 100 million years before being reactivated in both lineages.\n\nB. The development of saber-teeth is an example of convergent evolution, where similar selective pressures in similar ecological niches led to the independent evolution of analogous structures.\n\nC. The extreme similarity of the saber-teeth indicates that *Thylacosmilus* must be a direct ancestor of *Smilodon*, with the trait being passed down through descent with modification.\n\nD. The appearance of saber-teeth in two unrelated lineages is best explained by random genetic drift, where a neutral mutation for large teeth happened to become fixed by chance in both populations.\n\nE. The saber-teeth are examples of vestigial structures, representing a non-functional trait that has been retained in both lineages from a much earlier, unknown ancestor that used them for a different purpose.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the phylogenetic relationships and ancestral trait states. The problem states that Smilodon is a placental mammal (Eutheria) and Thylacosmilus is a metatherian (marsupial lineage). It also states that their last common ancestor lived over 160 million years ago and lacked saber-teeth. Therefore, any similarity in saber-teeth between these two taxa cannot be traced to a shared ancestral state. This directly contradicts the premise of option A, which posits inheritance from the common ancestor with dormant genes, and also contradicts option E, which requires retention from an earlier ancestor as a vestigial trait.\n\nNext, we evaluate whether one lineage could be ancestral to the other. Thylacosmilus and Smilodon belong to distinct mammalian clades (metatherians versus eutherians) with deep divergence in the Mesozoic, and fossil evidence places them in different time frames and lineages. Therefore, Thylacosmilus cannot be a direct ancestor of Smilodon. This eliminates option C.\n\nWe then assess the likely evolutionary mechanism for the emergence of saber-teeth in both lineages. The problem indicates that both organisms occupied similar ecological niches as apex predators of large herbivores. This implies similar selective pressures that could favor morphological adaptations such as elongated canines used functionally in predation. Such adaptive similarity arising in distantly related lineages is the hallmark of convergent evolution, producing analogous structures rather than homologous ones. This supports option B.\n\nFinally, we consider whether random genetic drift is a plausible explanation. Drift operates effectively on neutral or nearly neutral mutations and is unlikely to fix complex, functionally consequential traits like extreme saber-teeth in two separate lineages independently. Moreover, the strong functional context provided (apex predation on large herbivores) points to adaptive selection rather than neutrality. This eliminates option D.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate evolutionary explanation is convergent evolution yielding analogous saber-teeth in response to similar selective pressures in similar ecological niches, as stated in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1969741"}, {"introduction": "Some of the most powerful evidence for common descent is written in the language of DNA itself. This practice delves into the realm of molecular evolution by examining pseudogenes—non-functional \"relics\" of genes that were active in an ancestor. By analyzing the distribution of a functional gene and its corresponding pseudogene among related species, you can practice reconstructing the most parsimonious evolutionary history, revealing how shared genetic \"flaws\" serve as unambiguous markers of shared ancestry [@problem_id:1969718].", "problem": "Biologists are studying the evolutionary relationships among three mammalian species: Species A, Species B, and Species C. They focus on a gene known as `olfactase-7G`, which codes for an enzyme involved in a non-essential olfactory pathway. Their molecular analysis reveals the following:\n- In Species A, the `olfactase-7G` gene is present and fully functional, producing the active enzyme.\n- In Species B, a gene sequence is found at the same chromosomal locus as in Species A. This sequence is highly similar to Species A's functional `olfactase-7G` gene but contains a premature stop codon, rendering it a non-functional pseudogene.\n- In Species C, which is considered an outgroup relative to A and B, no sequence similar to the `olfactase-7G` gene or pseudogene is found anywhere in its genome.\n\nBased on these observations and the principles of molecular evolution, which of the following statements represents the most parsimonious and biologically sound conclusion about the evolutionary history of these species?\n\nA. The common ancestor of Species A and B possessed a functional `olfactase-7G` gene. The mutation that inactivated the gene occurred in the lineage leading to Species B after it diverged from the lineage leading to Species A.\n\nB. The pseudogene in Species B arose independently through random mutation and is an example of convergent evolution with the gene in Species A.\n\nC. The common ancestor of Species A and B possessed the non-functional `olfactase-7G` pseudogene. A later mutation in the lineage leading to Species A restored the gene's function.\n\nD. Species A is more closely related to Species C than to Species B, and the `olfactase-7G` gene was acquired by Species A through horizontal gene transfer.\n\nE. The `olfactase-7G` gene was once functional in the common ancestor of all three species (A, B, and C), but was lost completely in the lineage leading to Species C, and later inactivated in the lineage to Species B.", "solution": "We are given three species with observed gene states for the locus in question:\n- Species A has a functional gene; denote this as state $G$.\n- Species B has a pseudogene at the same locus, derived from the functional gene by a premature stop codon; denote this as state $P$.\n- Species C (the outgroup to A and B) lacks any similar sequence anywhere in its genome; denote this as state $0$.\n\nThus the observed tip states on the species tree with topology $((A,B),C)$ are $A:G$, $B:P$, and $C:0$.\n\nPrinciples to apply:\n1) Outgroup polarization: The outgroup’s state informs the ancestral state at the root. Because the outgroup C has state $0$, the most parsimonious and standard inference is that the ancestral state at the root is $0$.\n2) Biological constraint on pseudogene origin: A pseudogene $P$ at a given locus arises from a previously functional gene $G$ at that same locus via inactivating mutations; it does not arise de novo from absence ($0 \\to P$) without passing through $G$. Therefore, any reconstruction that yields $B:P$ must include a $G \\to P$ transition on the lineage to B, and prior to that, the presence of $G$ at that locus.\n3) Parsimony: Prefer reconstructions with the fewest evolutionary events that satisfy the observed states and known biological constraints.\n4) Additional biological plausibility: \n- Refunctionalization ($P \\to G$) is exceedingly unlikely compared to loss-of-function ($G \\to P$).\n- Convergent evolution producing a highly similar sequence at the same chromosomal locus is highly implausible.\n- Horizontal gene transfer across mammalian lineages is extremely rare relative to vertical descent and ordinary mutation.\n- The outgroup having no similar sequence anywhere supports a gain on the lineage leading to A and B rather than assuming an ancient ancestral gene followed by complete trace-free loss in C, though both are two-step scenarios by simple counting.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nOption A: Common ancestor of A and B had $G$; the $G \\to P$ inactivation occurred on the B lineage after divergence from A. With outgroup C as $0$, the most parsimonious reconstruction is:\n- Root (ancestor of A, B, C): $0$ (by outgroup polarization).\n- Branch leading to the A+B ancestor: $0 \\to G$ (gain of the gene).\n- Branch leading to B: $G \\to P$ (pseudogenization by inactivating mutation).\nThis uses two events: one gain and one inactivation, and respects the requirement that $P$ descends from $G$. It also explains the shared locus and high sequence similarity between A and B as orthology.\n\nOption B: Independent origin of B’s pseudogene by convergent evolution with A’s functional gene. To explain high similarity and identical locus by convergence would require multiple unlikely events and does not follow the $P$-from-$G$ constraint in a simple way. This is neither parsimonious nor biologically plausible.\n\nOption C: Ancestral state for A and B is $P$, and A later underwent $P \\to G$ refunctionalization. This requires a pseudogene to regain function, which is highly implausible given the accumulation of disabling changes; $P \\to G$ is far less likely than $G \\to P$. This violates biological plausibility.\n\nOption D: A is more closely related to C than to B and A acquired the gene by horizontal gene transfer. This contradicts the stated outgroup relationship and invokes horizontal gene transfer between mammals, which is highly unlikely; it also disregards the straightforward explanation via vertical descent and mutation.\n\nOption E: The ancestor of all three had $G$, C lost it completely ($G \\to 0$), and B inactivated it ($G \\to P$). This also uses two events. However, the outgroup lacks any similar sequence anywhere, supporting root $0$ under outgroup polarization rather than root $G$. Moreover, to reconcile $B:P$ one still requires a $0 \\to G$ somewhere on the lineage to A and B if the outgroup is $0$. Between the two equally counted scenarios (A and E), Option A follows standard outgroup polarization and avoids positing a complete, trace-free loss in C. Combined with the direct evidence of synteny and high sequence similarity between A and B, Option A is the most parsimonious and biologically sound.\n\nTherefore, the best conclusion is that the common ancestor of A and B had a functional gene, and pseudogenization occurred on the B lineage after divergence from A.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1969718"}]}
