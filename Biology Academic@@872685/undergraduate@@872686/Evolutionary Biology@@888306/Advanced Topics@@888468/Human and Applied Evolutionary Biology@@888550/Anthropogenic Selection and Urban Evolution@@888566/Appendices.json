This exercise provides a foundational, hands-on application of these principles.

In the forest, the allele frequency for a gene related to thermal tolerance has been stable for many generations. This gene has two alleles: a dominant allele $T$ that confers high heat tolerance, and a recessive allele $t$ that confers standard heat tolerance. The initial frequency of the recessive allele $t$ in the founding urban population is $q_0 = 0.8$.\n\nThe urban environment, with its large, sun-baked concrete surfaces, imposes a strong selective pressure. Individuals with the standard heat tolerance phenotype (genotype $tt$) have a lower survival rate. The relative fitness of genotypes are as follows: the fitness of $TT$ is 1, the fitness of $Tt$ is 1, and the fitness of $tt$ is $0.75$.\n\nAssuming the population mates randomly after selection occurs, calculate the frequency of the recessive allele $t$ in the next generation (the first generation born in the city). Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The goal is to calculate the frequency of the recessive allele $t$ after one generation of natural selection, which we will denote as $q_1$.\n\nFirst, we establish the initial conditions of the population. The initial frequency of the recessive allele $t$ is given as $q_0 = 0.8$. Since there are only two alleles for this gene, the frequency of the dominant allele $T$, denoted as $p_0$, must be:\n$$p_0 = 1 - q_0 = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$$\n\nNext, assuming the founding population is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), we can calculate the initial frequencies of the three genotypes before selection acts:\n- Frequency of homozygous dominant ($TT$): $f(TT) = p_0^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04$\n- Frequency of heterozygous ($Tt$): $f(Tt) = 2p_0q_0 = 2(0.2)(0.8) = 0.32$\n- Frequency of homozygous recessive ($tt$): $f(tt) = q_0^2 = (0.8)^2 = 0.64$\nAs a check, the sum of these frequencies is $0.04 + 0.32 + 0.64 = 1.0$.\n\nNow, we introduce the effect of selection. The relative fitness values ($w$) are given for each genotype: $w_{TT} = 1$, $w_{Tt} = 1$, and $w_{tt} = 0.75$. We can find the contribution of each genotype to the gene pool of the next generation by multiplying its initial frequency by its relative fitness.\n- Contribution from $TT$: $f(TT) \\times w_{TT} = 0.04 \\times 1 = 0.04$\n- Contribution from $Tt$: $f(Tt) \\times w_{Tt} = 0.32 \\times 1 = 0.32$\n- Contribution from $tt$: $f(tt) \\times w_{tt} = 0.64 \\times 0.75 = 0.48$\n\nThe sum of these products gives the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$. This value is used to normalize the genotype frequencies after selection.\n$$\\bar{w} = (p_0^2 \\times w_{TT}) + (2p_0q_0 \\times w_{Tt}) + (q_0^2 \\times w_{tt})$$\n$$\\bar{w} = 0.04 + 0.32 + 0.48 = 0.84$$\n\nAfter selection, the new frequencies of the genotypes in the adult population that will reproduce are found by dividing their weighted contributions by the mean fitness $\\bar{w}$.\n- Frequency of $TT$ after selection: $f'(TT) = \\frac{0.04}{0.84}$\n- Frequency of $Tt$ after selection: $f'(Tt) = \\frac{0.32}{0.84}$\n- Frequency of $tt$ after selection: $f'(tt) = \\frac{0.48}{0.84}$\n\nThe frequency of the $t$ allele in the next generation, $q_1$, is the frequency of alleles contributed by the surviving adults. Homozygous $tt$ individuals contribute only $t$ alleles, while heterozygous $Tt$ individuals contribute $t$ alleles half the time. Therefore, $q_1$ is the frequency of $tt$ adults plus half the frequency of $Tt$ adults.\n$$q_1 = f'(tt) + \\frac{1}{2}f'(Tt)$$\n$$q_1 = \\frac{0.48}{0.84} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{0.32}{0.84}\\right)$$\n$$q_1 = \\frac{0.48}{0.84} + \\frac{0.16}{0.84}$$\n$$q_1 = \\frac{0.48 + 0.16}{0.84} = \\frac{0.64}{0.84}$$\n\nThis can also be expressed using the general formula for the frequency of the recessive allele after one generation of selection:\n$$q_1 = \\frac{q_0^2 w_{tt} + p_0 q_0 w_{Tt}}{\\bar{w}}$$\n$$q_1 = \\frac{(0.8)^2(0.75) + (0.2)(0.8)(1)}{0.84} = \\frac{(0.64)(0.75) + 0.16}{0.84} = \\frac{0.48 + 0.16}{0.84} = \\frac{0.64}{0.84}$$\n\nNow, we perform the final calculation:\n$$q_1 = \\frac{64}{84} = \\frac{16}{21} \\approx 0.76190476...$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$q_1 \\approx 0.762$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.762}$$", "id": "1909169"}, {"introduction": "When observing differences between urban and rural populations, a critical question arises: are these differences due to evolved genetic changes or a direct, flexible response to the environment (phenotypic plasticity)?

Interpreting the results of this hypothetical experiment will sharpen your ability to distinguish between fixed adaptation and plasticity, a key skill in evolutionary studies.", "problem": "An ecologist is studying a plant species, *Silene urbanica*, that has successfully colonized two distinct habitats: a pristine, rural meadow and the soil adjacent to a busy highway. The highway-adjacent soil is known to have high concentrations of heavy metals from vehicle emissions. Field observations show that plants from the highway population are consistently smaller and have a lower seed yield compared to the plants in the meadow population.\n\nTo investigate the cause of this stunted growth, the ecologist performs a \"common garden\" experiment. She collects seeds from both the highway population (H) and the meadow population (M). In a controlled greenhouse, she plants seeds from both populations in two different soil treatments: (1) clean soil sourced from the meadow and (2) contaminated soil sourced from the highway site. A key fitness proxy, the average final dry biomass per plant, is measured after 10 weeks of growth.\n\nTwo primary hypotheses are being tested:\n1.  **Adaptive Phenotypic Plasticity**: The stunted growth is a non-genetic, physiological response to the stressful contaminated soil. All *Silene urbanica* plants have the same underlying genetic potential for growth, but this potential is suppressed by the presence of toxins.\n2.  **Fixed Genetic Divergence**: The highway population has undergone rapid evolution. The observed stunted growth is a genetically determined trait that is now fixed in the highway population, perhaps as a trade-off for enhanced heavy metal tolerance.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes would provide the strongest evidence in support of the **Adaptive Phenotypic Plasticity** hypothesis?\n\nA. Plants from the H-population exhibit low biomass in both soil types, while plants from the M-population exhibit high biomass in both soil types.\n\nB.

An adaptation that increases fitness in one context, such as developing powerful muscles for speed to escape urban predators, may divert resources from other vital functions like reproduction. This exercise challenges you to build a simple mathematical model to formalize this concept and quantify the reproductive cost associated with an evolutionary increase in sprint speed, illustrating the constrained nature of adaptation.", "problem": "A field biologist is studying rapid evolution in a fictional lizard species, *Urbanolis rapidus*, in response to anthropogenic pressures. Two distinct populations are observed. The first population resides in a protected nature reserve, where its natural predators are scarce. The second population inhabits a nearby residential suburb, where the lizards are frequently preyed upon by a large, subsidized population of domestic cats.\n\nField measurements reveal that the suburban lizards have evolved a significantly higher maximum sprint speed compared to their reserve-dwelling counterparts. The biologist proposes that this adaptation comes with a fitness trade-off. Specifically, the energetic investment required to develop and maintain the powerful musculature for high-speed sprinting diverts resources from reproduction.\n\nThis trade-off is described by a simplified model where the average clutch size (number of eggs, $N$) for a population is a function of its characteristic maximum sprint speed, $v$. The model is given by the equation:\n$$ N(v) = N_{max} - \\beta v^{2} $$\nThis model is valid for the range of speeds observed in the two populations.
