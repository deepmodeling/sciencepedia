The experiment begins with an ancestral strain of *E. coli* that has been genetically engineered to express a red fluorescent protein. After a long period of growth in a specific environment, a new, more adapted lineage emerges. To easily track this evolved lineage, the student engineers it to express a green fluorescent protein.\n\nTo quantify the fitness advantage of the evolved strain, a competition experiment is performed. The student mixes the ancestral (red) and evolved (green) strains together in a flask containing fresh growth medium. At the start of the experiment (time $t=0$), a sample is taken and analyzed using flow cytometry to count the number of cells of each type. The initial concentrations are:\n- Ancestral strain concentration at $t=0$: $N_{anc,0} = 5.1 \\times 10^5$ cells/mL\n- Evolved strain concentration at $t=0$: $N_{evo,0} = 4.9 \\times 10^5$ cells/mL\n\nThe flask is then incubated for a period of $T=24$ hours, during which both bacterial populations grow. At the end of this period, another sample is analyzed, and the final concentrations are measured:\n- Ancestral strain concentration at $t=T$: $N_{anc,T} = 1.15 \\times 10^7$ cells/mL\n- Evolved strain concentration at $t=T$: $N_{evo,T} = 1.65 \\times 10^7$ cells/mL\n\nAssuming that the growth of both populations during the competition can be modeled by exponential growth, $N(t) = N(0)\\exp(r t)$, where $r$ is the Malthusian growth rate.

This conceptual exercise challenges you to think about the different ways a bacterial population can adapt to carrying a costly, non-essential gene. You will evaluate several potential outcomes, from purging the gene entirely to adapting to its presence, learning to weigh the likelihood of different evolutionary trajectories based on core principles [@problem_id:1928578].", "problem": "A population of bacteria, *Escherichia coli*, is genetically engineered to carry a non-conjugative plasmid. This plasmid carries a single gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic tetracycline, but the plasmid provides no other identified function for the host cell. The expression of this resistance gene is known to impose a significant metabolic cost, reducing the bacterium's maximum growth rate by 15% compared to its plasmid-free counterpart.\n\nThis engineered bacterial population is used to inoculate a chemostat, a laboratory apparatus that maintains a constant population size by continuously supplying fresh, simple growth medium and removing an equal volume of culture. The growth medium contains all necessary nutrients for the bacteria but is completely free of tetracycline. The culture is maintained under these selective conditions for 2,000 generations.\n\nBased on the principles of microbial evolution, which of the following outcomes represent the most likely evolutionary fates for the plasmid and its associated genetic information within this bacterial population? Select all that apply.\n\nA. **Plasmid Loss**: The entire plasmid is lost from a subpopulation of cells during cell division. These plasmid-free cells, having a higher growth rate, then outcompete the plasmid-carrying cells, leading to a population eventually dominated by plasmid-free individuals.\n\nB. **Gene Amelioration**: Deletions or loss-of-function point mutations accumulate within the tetracycline resistance gene on the plasmid. This reduces or eliminates the cost of gene expression, conferring a selective advantage, while the rest of the plasmid is retained.\n\nC. **Horizontal Transfer**: The plasmid is transferred to a different, co-habiting microbial species for which the plasmid is less costly or potentially beneficial, and is subsequently lost from the original *E. coli* population.\n\nD. **Compensatory Evolution**: Mutations arise on the bacterial chromosome that reduce or negate the metabolic cost imposed by the plasmid. This co-adaptation allows cells to retain the plasmid without suffering a significant growth disadvantage.\n\nE. **Integrative Stabilization**: The entire plasmid inserts itself into the bacterial chromosome, becoming a permanent and stable part of the host's genome, thereby ensuring its vertical transmission to all daughter cells.", "solution": "The problem describes a classic scenario in experimental evolution where a genetic element (a plasmid) imposes a cost without providing any benefit. The central principle at play is natural selection: traits that decrease an organism's relative fitness will be selected against. Here, the fitness cost is a 15% reduction in growth rate. We must evaluate each option based on its likelihood in this selective environment.\n\nFirst, we analyze the selective pressures. The environment is tetracycline-free, so the resistance gene is useless. The plasmid's presence is purely costly. Therefore, any genetic change that alleviates this cost will be strongly selected for.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Plasmid Loss**: This is a highly likely outcome. Plasmids, especially non-essential ones, can be lost during cell division through segregation error. A bacterium that loses the plasmid is immediately freed from the 15% growth rate cost. In a competitive environment like a chemostat, this cell and its descendants will replicate faster than their plasmid-bearing counterparts. This strong selective advantage means the plasmid-free lineage will rapidly increase in frequency and likely come to dominate the population. This process, known as plasmid curing, is a common and direct evolutionary response to the cost of carriage.\n\n**B. Gene Amelioration**: This is also a very likely outcome. The metabolic cost is tied to the expression of the resistance gene. Random mutations are always occurring throughout the genome, including the plasmid DNA. Mutations such as nonsense mutations (creating a premature stop codon), frameshift mutations, or deletions within the resistance gene can render the resulting protein non-functional or prevent its expression altogether. If the cost is primarily from producing the protein, such mutations would reduce or eliminate this cost. A cell with such a mutated plasmid would have a growth rate higher than a cell with the original plasmid, granting it a selective advantage. This allows the cell to keep the plasmid backbone while shedding the specific cost. This is a more \"fine-tuned\" evolutionary response than losing the entire plasmid and is frequently observed in experiments.\n\n**C. Horizontal Transfer**: The problem specifies that the plasmid is \"non-conjugative,\" meaning it cannot initiate its own transfer to other bacteria. Furthermore, the experiment is conducted in a \"simple growth medium,\" which in a laboratory context implies a monoculture of *E. coli*. There are no other species present to act as recipients for the plasmid. Even if transfer were possible through other rare mechanisms (like transduction or transformation), the absence of a recipient population makes this outcome highly improbable in the described setup.\n\n**D. Compensatory Evolution**: This is another plausible and well-documented evolutionary pathway. While selection acts to eliminate the costly plasmid, it can also act on the host's chromosome. A random mutation might occur in a host gene that mitigates the negative effect of the plasmid. For instance, a mutation in a metabolic pathway or a gene affecting DNA replication might \"compensate\" for the burden imposed by the plasmid, effectively reducing the net cost of carriage. A cell with such a compensatory mutation would grow faster than the original strain while still carrying the plasmid. Over 2,000 generations, there is sufficient time for such beneficial chromosomal mutations to arise and be selected for, leading to a population that has adapted to the plasmid's presence. This can lead to the long-term stabilization of the plasmid.\n\n**E. Integrative Stabilization**: Plasmid integration into the host chromosome is a specific molecular event that requires mechanisms like transposons or homologous recombination at insertion sequences. Many laboratory plasmids are designed to be non-integrating. Even for plasmids capable of integration (episomes), the event itself is typically much rarer than the rate of plasmid loss due to segregation error or the rate of point mutations. Given the strong and immediate selective advantage of plasmid loss (A) or gene inactivation (B), these faster evolutionary pathways are far more likely to dominate the population dynamics before a rare integration event could occur and become fixed. Therefore, this is not considered one of the *most likely* outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, the strong negative selection will most likely favor the most direct and frequent evolutionary pathways that reduce the metabolic cost. These are the complete loss of the plasmid (A), the inactivation of the costly gene on the plasmid (B), and the host's adaptation to the plasmid's presence (D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "1928578"}]}
