This exercise provides a concrete example of how we can use the principles of population genetics to model the initial stages of such a conflict. By calculating the change in allele frequency in a single generation, you can quantify the intense selective pressure a brood parasite exerts on its host and appreciate the critical role of genetic trade-offs in shaping the evolutionary trajectory. [@problem_id:1914777]", "problem": "On a remote island, a population of Azure Flycatchers has recently been exposed to a new, invasive brood parasite: the Onyx Cuckoo. The cuckoo lays its eggs in the flycatcher nests. If the host does not remove the foreign egg, the cuckoo chick hatches and outcompetes the host's own brood, resulting in zero reproductive success for the flycatcher from that nest.\n\nThe ability of a flycatcher to identify and eject a cuckoo egg is controlled by a single genetic locus with two alleles, R (for recognition) and r (for non-recognition). The R allele is dominant, meaning individuals with genotypes RR or Rr can successfully identify and remove cuckoo eggs. Individuals with the rr genotype are unable to recognize the foreign eggs.\n\nThere is, however, a drawback to the recognition ability. Birds carrying the R allele sometimes make mistakes and eject one of their own eggs. This behavior reduces their overall reproductive success by a factor of 3% compared to a hypothetical bird with perfect recognition and no parasitism.\n\nAt the start of the first breeding season with the cuckoos present, the frequency of the non-recognition allele r in the flycatcher population is $0.98$. During this season, it is observed that cuckoos parasitize 40% of all flycatcher nests.\n\nAssuming the flycatcher population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the beginning of the season (before selection by the cuckoos occurs), calculate the frequency of the non-recognition allele, r, in the gene pool of the next generation of flycatchers.
