This practice brings the concept of Batesian mimicry into a tangible, experimental context [@problem_id:1831743]. By analyzing hypothetical data from a controlled experiment, you will quantify the precise survival benefit a harmless mimic gains from the presence of its dangerous model, illustrating a classic method for testing evolutionary hypotheses.", "problem": "Ecologists are investigating the effectiveness of Batesian mimicry, where a harmless species (the mimic) evolves to resemble a harmful species (the model) to deter predators. They conducted an experiment focused on the drone fly (*Eristalis tenax*), a harmless hoverfly, which mimics the venomous Western yellowjacket (*Vespula pensylvanica*).\n\nThe experiment utilized two large, identical, enclosed mesocosms, each containing a stable population of a generalist insectivorous bird species to act as the predator.\n- **Mesocosm A (Mimicry Advantage):** This environment contained the predators and a healthy, foraging population of the Western yellowjacket model.\n- **Mesocosm B (Baseline):** This environment was identical to Mesocosm A, containing only the predators, but had no Western yellowjackets present.\n\nAt the start of the experiment, an initial population of $N_{initial} = 750$ lab-reared drone flies was introduced into each of the two mesocosms. After a period of 45 days, long enough for predation pressure to have a measurable effect, the ecologists carefully recovered and counted all surviving drone flies in each enclosure.\n\nThe final counts were as follows:\n- In Mesocosm A (with the wasp model), $N_A = 482$ drone flies survived.\n- In Mesocosm B (without the wasp model), $N_B = 295$ drone flies survived.\n\nTo quantify the protective benefit of the mimicry, calculate the ratio of the survival rate in the presence of the wasp model to the survival rate in its absence. This value indicates how many times more likely an individual drone fly was to survive due to the presence of the wasps. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures. The resulting ratio is a dimensionless quantity.", "solution": "We are asked to compute the ratio of survival rates of drone flies in the presence versus absence of the wasp model. Define survival rates as the fraction of the initial population that survived:\n$$\nS_{A}=\\frac{N_{A}}{N_{\\text{initial}}}, \\quad S_{B}=\\frac{N_{B}}{N_{\\text{initial}}}.\n$$\nThe desired ratio is the survival rate with the model divided by the survival rate without the model:\n$$\nR=\\frac{S_{A}}{S_{B}}=\\frac{\\frac{N_{A}}{N_{\\text{initial}}}}{\\frac{N_{B}}{N_{\\text{initial}}}}=\\frac{N_{A}}{N_{B}},\n$$\nusing cancellation because both mesocosms had the same initial number $N_{\\text{initial}}$.\n\nSubstituting the given counts,\n$$\nR=\\frac{482}{295}.\n$$\nThis fraction does not reduce further.

This exercise uses a simple but powerful mathematical model to explore this relationship, demonstrating the principle of negative frequency-dependent selection [@problem_id:1831766]. You will determine the maximum density of mimics an ecosystem can support, revealing why the \"credibility\" of the warning signal to predators is key to the system's stability.", "problem": "In a simplified ecosystem model, a population of avian predators preys upon three species of snakes: a venomous coral snake (the model), a harmless kingsnake that mimics the coral snake's coloration (the mimic), and a harmless, non-patterned garter snake (the non-mimic). The population densities of these snakes are $D_M$, $D_m$, and $D_N$, respectively. The predators are intelligent and can learn to avoid the distinctive warning pattern shared by the model and the mimic.\n\nLet's quantify the fitness consequences for a predator: an attack on a venomous model incurs a severe fitness cost $C$, where $C  0$, while successfully capturing and consuming a harmless snake (either mimic or non-mimic) yields a fitness benefit $B$, where $B  0$. The predators in this ecosystem will collectively learn to avoid the warning pattern if, on average, an attack on a snake bearing this pattern results in a negative expected fitness change. This collective learning is based on the relative abundance of model and mimic snakes. If mimics become too common, the \"lesson\" of the warning signal is diluted, and the pattern ceases to be an effective deterrent.\n\nAssuming that a predator encountering a patterned snake cannot distinguish between a model and a mimic before attacking, determine the maximum possible density of the mimic population, $D_{m, \\text{max}}$, for which the mimicry remains an effective strategy. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of the model snake density $D_M$, the predator fitness cost $C$, and the predator fitness benefit $B$.", "solution": "Let the total density of patterned snakes be $D_{P} = D_{M} + D_{m}$. A predator encountering a patterned snake cannot distinguish model from mimic, so the probability the encountered snake is a model is $p_{M} = \\frac{D_{M}}{D_{P}}$, and the probability it is a mimic is $p_{m} = \\frac{D_{m}}{D_{P}}$.\n\nThe expected fitness change from attacking a patterned snake is the sum over outcomes, weighted by their probabilities and payoffs. An attack on a model yields $-C$ and an attack on a mimic yields $+B$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Delta F = p_{M}(-C) + p_{m} B = \\frac{-C D_{M} + B D_{m}}{D_{M} + D_{m}}.\n$$\nPredators will collectively learn to avoid the warning pattern if the expected change is negative, i.e., $\\Delta F  0$. The largest mimic density for which the warning pattern remains an effective deterrent occurs at the threshold where $\\Delta F = 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{-C D_{M} + B D_{m}}{D_{M} + D_{m}} = 0.\n$$\nSince $D_{M} + D_{m}  0$, multiply through to obtain\n$$\n-C D_{M} + B D_{m} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad D_{m} = \\frac{C}{B} D_{M}.\n$$\nThus the maximum mimic density compatible with an effective warning pattern is $D_{m,\\text{max}} = \\frac{C}{B} D_{M}$.

By calculating the impact on predator learning, you will discover that the evolution of the mimic can also benefit the original, well-defended model, showcasing the transition from a parasitic to a mutualistic dynamic.", "problem": "In a stable tropical ecosystem, two butterfly species, Species A and Species B, are visually identical and are preyed upon by a native bird species. Species A is highly toxic, conferring it an unpalatability level rated at $U_A = 10$ units. Initially, Species B is harmless and completely palatable, having an unpalatability of $U_{B, \\text{initial}} = 0$. The population is composed of 60% Species A and 40% Species B, so their relative frequencies are $f_A = 0.6$ and $f_B = 0.4$, respectively.\n\nThe avian predators are naive at first and learn to avoid the butterflies' distinct coloration through negative reinforcement. A predator will continue to randomly consume these butterflies according to their population frequencies until it has accumulated a total \"unpalatability experience\" of $E_{learn} = 60$ units. Upon reaching this threshold, it learns to avoid both species permanently. The experience gained from consuming a single butterfly is equal to that butterfly's unpalatability value.\n\nOver a long period, Species B evolves its own chemical defense, becoming mildly unpalatable. Its new unpalatability level is $U_{B, \\text{final}} = 3$. The relative frequencies of the two species remain unchanged.\n\nCalculate the change in the average number of individuals of Species A that must be consumed for a single predator to learn avoidance.
