For niche construction, this calculation can be complex because the costs are often paid by one individual, while the benefits may be inherited by others, such as their offspring. This exercise [@problem_id:1950545] provides a foundational understanding of this evolutionary accounting by modeling the trade-off between a direct cost to a parent's own reproduction and the benefit provided to its offspring through an improved, inherited environment. By working through this simple model, you will derive a clear, quantitative condition for when a niche-constructing gene is favored by selection.", "problem": "Consider a simple model of a haploid, asexual organism. A single gene determines a key ecological behavior: allele $N$ causes the parent to construct a protective nest for its offspring, while the alternative allele $n$ does not. The construction of this nest is costly to the parent. The personal reproductive output of a parent with allele $N$ is reduced by a factor $c$, where $0  c  1$, relative to a baseline of 1. However, the offspring that inherit this nest receive an ecological benefit, increasing their own survival to adulthood by a factor $b$, where $b > 0$, relative to a baseline of 1. A parent with allele $n$ incurs no cost (relative reproductive output is 1), and its offspring receive no benefit (relative survival is 1). Assume discrete, non-overlapping generations.

When some individuals invest in building or modifying the environment, they may create opportunities that can be exploited by others who do not invest. This practice [@problem_id:1950544] uses the framework of evolutionary game theory to explore these social dynamics. By analyzing the interactions between \"Digger\" squirrels that construct burrows and \"Non-digger\" squirrels that occupy existing ones, you will see how frequency-dependent selection can lead to a stable coexistence of both strategies, providing a more realistic picture of how niche construction functions within a diverse population.", "problem": "In a population of Richardson's ground squirrels, two heritable behavioral strategies exist for acquiring burrows. 'Diggers' expend energy to construct new burrows, a form of niche construction. 'Non-diggers' do not dig, instead seeking to occupy existing burrows. The reproductive success (fitness) of an individual depends on its own strategy and the strategy of the squirrel it interacts with over a contested resource. The fitness gains from these interactions are described as follows:\n\n*   When a Digger interacts with another Digger, high density leads to increased predation risk and resource competition. Each Digger successfully builds a burrow, gaining a benefit $B$, but incurs both a digging cost $C$ and a competition cost $C_{\\text{comp}}$. The net fitness gain is $B - C - C_{\\text{comp}}$.\n*   When a Digger interacts with a Non-digger, the Digger secures its self-made burrow without local competition from another digger. The net fitness gain is $B - C$.\n*   When a Non-digger interacts with a Digger, the Non-digger attempts to take over the Digger's burrow. The Non-digger's average fitness gain from such encounters is $B$, as it can acquire a prime burrow without paying any digging costs itself.\n*   When a Non-digger interacts with another Non-digger, they must compete for the scarce, low-quality abandoned burrows left from previous seasons. The expected fitness gain for each from this interaction is a low value, $B_{\\text{old}}$.\n\nIn this system, selection is frequency-dependent, leading to a stable equilibrium where both strategies coexist. Given the following fitness parameters: benefit of a prime burrow $B = 12$; cost of digging $C = 5$; cost of competition between diggers $C_{\\text{comp}} = 2$; and benefit of an old burrow $B_{\\text{old}} = 1$.
