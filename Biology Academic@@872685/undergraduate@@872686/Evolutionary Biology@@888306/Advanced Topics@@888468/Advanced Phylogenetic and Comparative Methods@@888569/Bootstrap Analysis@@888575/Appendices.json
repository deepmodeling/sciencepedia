After sequencing a specific ribosomal gene from each species, they create a multiple sequence alignment.

This procedure involves generating 2500 replicate datasets from the original alignment and constructing a tree for each one.\n\nIn the final consensus tree, the node defining a particular clade that groups Species Alpha and Species Beta together, to the exclusion of the other four species, is found to have a bootstrap support value of 68%.

High support suggests consistent evidence, while low support can indicate either a lack of information or, more interestingly, the presence of conflicting signals in your alignment. This problem challenges you to act as a phylogenetic detective, using a pattern of mixed support values to infer the most likely story written in the underlying DNA sequences [@problem_id:1912038].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying the phylogenetic relationships among four species, designated A, B, C, and D, using a Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequence alignment consisting of 1000 nucleotide sites. A phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood method recovers a single best-fit tree with the topology (A, (B, (C, D))). To assess the statistical confidence in this tree structure, a bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates is performed. The results show that the node defining the clade (C, D) has a bootstrap support value of 98%, while the node defining the clade (B, (C, D)) has a bootstrap support value of only 55%.\n\nWhich of the following character patterns in the underlying 1000-site DNA alignment provides the most plausible data-driven explanation for this specific combination of high and low bootstrap support values?\n\nA. The vast majority of the 1000 sites are identical across all four species, with informative phylogenetic signal present at only a handful of sites.\n\nB. There is a large number of phylogenetically informative sites that unambiguously support the (C, D) clade, and a separate, large number of informative sites that unambiguously support the (B, (C, D)) clade.\n\nC. There is a strong and consistent phylogenetic signal for the (C, D) clade across many sites. However, for the placement of taxon B, the remaining informative sites show nearly equal support for two conflicting hypotheses: B grouping with (C, D), and B grouping with A.\n\nD. The branch leading to taxon B is extremely long compared to the others, indicating a rapid rate of evolution. This has caused a large number of unique mutations in B that are phylogenetically uninformative for this four-taxon problem and thus do not contribute to resolving its position.\n\nE. All phylogenetically informative sites in the alignment are congruent and support the topology (A, (B, (C, D))), but the total number of such informative sites is very small.", "solution": "We interpret nonparametric bootstrap support as the proportion of resampled alignments (columns resampled with replacement from the original $1000$ sites) that recover a given clade under the same inference method. Thus, a value of $0.98$ for the clade $(C,D)$ indicates that in approximately $0.98 \\times 1000$ replicates the analysis recovered $(C,D)$, which requires many sites to contain a consistent, low-conflict signal for the split separating $\\{C,D\\}$ from $\\{A,B\\}$. Conversely, a value of $0.55$ for the clade $(B,(C,D))$ indicates that only about $0.55 \\times 1000$ replicates recovered that grouping; hence, there is weak overall support for the placement of $B$ relative to $A$ and the $(C,D)$ clade, implying either limited information or substantial conflicting signal among sites about whether $B$ groups with $(C,D)$ or with $A$.\n\nFor four taxa, a site is phylogenetically informative if it supports one of the three possible splits. The high support for $(C,D)$ implies many informative sites consistently supporting the split $\\{C,D\\}|\\{A,B\\}$. The low support for $(B,(C,D))$ implies that, conditional on the strong $(C,D)$ signal, the remaining informative sites relevant to placing $B$ exhibit near-balanced support between the two alternatives: $B$ with $(C,D)$ versus $B$ with $A$. If the latter supports are nearly equal, bootstrap resamples will fluctuate around a proportion near one-half, consistent with $0.55$.\n\nEvaluate the options against these implications:\n- Option A posits that only a handful of sites are informative. With so few informative sites, bootstrap resampling would frequently omit them, typically producing uniformly low support for all internal nodes. Obtaining $0.98$ for $(C,D)$ would be unlikely under this pattern, so A is implausible.\n- Option B posits a large number of informative sites unambiguously supporting both $(C,D)$ and $(B,(C,D))$. That would produce high support for both nodes, contradicting the observed $0.55$, so B is implausible.\n- Option C posits strong, consistent signal for $(C,D)$ across many sites, and nearly equal support for the two conflicting placements of $B$. This directly explains high support for $(C,D)$ and low, near-half support for $(B,(C,D))$, matching the observed $0.98$ and $0.55$. This is the most plausible data pattern.\n- Option D posits many autapomorphies on the $B$ branch that are uninformative. While this could reduce information about $B$’s placement, uninformative changes do not generate conflicting support; they merely dilute signal. In a purely low-information scenario for $B$, bootstrap support would tend toward about one-half among the two alternatives conditional on $(C,D)$, but this option does not posit the strong, consistent $(C,D)$ signal nor the explicit near-equal conflict needed to explain $0.55$ as opposed to a more diffuse outcome. It is less precise than C as a data-pattern explanation.\n- Option E posits few but fully congruent informative sites supporting the entire topology. With very few such sites, bootstrap resampling would tend to yield low support for both internal nodes, not a split of $0.98$ versus $0.55$, so E is implausible.\n\nTherefore, the character pattern most consistent with the observed bootstrap values is the one in Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1912038"}, {"introduction": "After inferring that conflicting data might be the cause of a poorly supported node, the next step is to identify the source of that conflict.
