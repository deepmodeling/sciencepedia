The stable population size of the yeast is maintained at $N = 100$ individuals. One day, a single, spontaneous mutation occurs in one of the yeast cells, creating a new allele. This new allele is found to be selectively neutral, meaning it confers no reproductive advantage or disadvantage to the cell carrying it.\n\nAssuming the population dynamics can be accurately described by the Wright-Fisher model of genetic drift, which of the following pairs correctly identifies the initial frequency of this new neutral allele in the population and its corresponding probability of eventual fixation?\n\nA.

This practice problem has you quantify how population size ($N$) inversely affects the magnitude of allele frequency fluctuations, measured by the variance in allele frequency after one generation. By comparing two populations of different sizes, you will develop a clear, mathematical understanding of why drift is a more potent evolutionary force in smaller populations [@problem_id:1975793].", "problem": "Consider two isolated populations of a diploid, sexually reproducing species. Both populations are studied under the assumptions of the Wright-Fisher model of genetic drift.\n\nPopulation A has a constant size of $N_A = 25$ individuals.\nPopulation B has a constant size of $N_B = 2500$ individuals.\n\nIn both populations, a particular gene locus has two alleles, `A1` and `A2`. The initial frequency of allele `A1` in the parent generation is exactly $p_0 = 0.5$ for both populations. The populations are subject only to genetic drift, with no selection, mutation, or migration occurring.\n\nAccording to the Wright-Fisher model, the number of `A1` alleles in the next generation is a binomial random variable. This leads to a theoretical variance in the allele frequency in the next generation. Let $V_A$ be the theoretical variance of the frequency of allele `A1` in Population A after one generation, and let $V_B$ be the theoretical variance of the frequency of allele `A1` in Population B after one generation.\n\nCalculate the ratio $\\frac{V_A}{V_B}$.", "solution": "Under the Wright-Fisher model for a diploid population of size $N$, the next generation’s allele count $X$ for allele $A1$ is modeled as a binomial random variable with parameters $2N$ trials and success probability equal to the current allele frequency $p$.

This final exercise extends our analysis to consider the fate of a newly arisen beneficial allele, highlighting the crucial interplay between genetic drift and natural selection.

A single novel allele arises from a mutation that affects the efficiency of water retention in the kidneys. This allele is slightly beneficial, conferring a selective advantage, denoted by $s$, to heterozygous individuals over wild-type homozygotes. The value of this selective advantage is $s = 0.01$.

This probability is determined by the interplay between random genetic drift and natural selection. We can calculate this using a standard result from population genetics theory derived by Motoo Kimura, often based on a diffusion approximation of the Wright-Fisher model.\n\nThe fixation probability, $\\Pi$, of an allele with an initial frequency $p_0$ and a selective advantage $s$ in heterozygotes (in a diploid population of effective size $N_e$) is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\Pi = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-4 N_e s p_0)}{1 - \\exp(-4 N_e s)}\n$$\n\nFirst, we must determine the initial frequency, $p_0$, of the new allele. The problem states that the population is diploid and has an effective size of $N_e$. This means there are a total of $2N_e$ gene copies for any given locus in the population's gene pool. Since the allele arises as a single new mutation in one individual, its initial count is 1. Therefore, its initial frequency is:\n$$\np_0 = \\frac{1}{2N_e}\n$$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $p_0$ into the general formula for fixation probability:\n$$\n\\Pi = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-4 N_e s \\left(\\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)\\right)}{1 - \\exp(-4 N_e s)}\n$$\n\nSimplifying the term in the numerator's exponent:\n$$\n-4 N_e s \\left(\\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) = -2s\n$$\nThis gives us the specific formula for the fixation probability of a single new mutation:\n$$\n\\Pi = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2s)}{1 - \\exp(-4 N_e s)}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values given in the problem statement:\n- Effective population size: $N_e = 40$\n- Selective advantage: $s = 0.01$\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$$\n\\Pi = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2 \\times 0.01)}{1 - \\exp(-4 \\times 40 \\times 0.01)}\n$$\n\nLet's calculate the exponents:\n- Numerator exponent: $-2 \\times 0.01 = -0.02$\n- Denominator exponent: $-4 \\times 40 \\times 0.01 = -160 \\times 0.01 = -1.6$\n\nThe expression becomes:\n$$\n\\Pi = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.02)}{1 - \\exp(-1.6)}\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the numerical value:\n$$\n\\Pi = \\frac{1 - 0.98019867...}{1 - 0.20189652...} = \\frac{0.01980133...}{0.79810348...} \\approx 0.02481030\n$$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Pi \\approx 0.02481\n$$\nThis value represents the probability that the beneficial allele, despite the strong effects of genetic drift in such a small population, will eventually become the only allele present at this locus.
