They created an F2 intercross population by mating domestic chickens (selected for large body size) with their wild ancestors, the Red Junglefowl. After measuring the body weight of hundreds of F2 individuals and genotyping them at various genetic markers, they performed a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis. A QTL is a region of the genome associated with variation in a particular quantitative trait.\n\nThe strength of the association between a genomic region and the trait is measured by a Logarithm of Odds (LOD) score. A high LOD score at a specific chromosomal location suggests that a QTL is likely located there. The researchers have established a significance threshold for their study: a local peak in the LOD score of 3.0 or greater is considered significant evidence for the presence of a QTL.\n\nBelow are the LOD scores calculated at several positions along chromosome 4. The positions are given in centiMorgans (cM), a unit of genetic map distance.\n\n- Position 10 cM: LOD Score = 0.9\n- Position 35 cM: LOD Score = 2.4\n- Position 50 cM: LOD Score = 4.2\n- Position 65 cM: LOD Score = 3.1\n- Position 80 cM: LOD Score = 1.5\n- Position 105 cM: LOD Score = 1.9\n- Position 120 cM: LOD Score = 5.6\n- Position 135 cM: LOD Score = 4.0\n- Position 150 cM: LOD Score = 2.1\n- Position 165 cM: LOD Score = 1.2\n- Position 180 cM: LOD Score = 2.8\n\nBased on this data and the significance threshold, how many significant QTLs affecting body weight are located on chromosome 4, and what are their most likely positions?\n\nA.

Does the heterozygote's phenotype lie midway between the two homozygotes (additive action), or does it resemble one of the parents (dominant action)?

Two true-breeding (inbred) lines are used as the parental generation (P).\n- Line A is homozygous for alleles that result in small fruit. Its genotype at a specific Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) influencing fruit weight is denoted as q1q1.\n- Line B is homozygous for alleles that result in large fruit. Its genotype at the same QTL is q2q2.\n\nA codominant molecular marker, M, has been identified that is very tightly linked to this QTL, meaning that the marker and the QTL are almost always inherited together. Line A has the marker genotype M1M1, and Line B has the marker genotype M2M2.\n\nThe geneticist crosses Line A and Line B to produce an F1 generation, and then self-pollinates individuals from the F1 generation to create a large F2 population. In the F2 population, each plant is genotyped for the marker locus (M), and their average fruit weight is measured. This allows the F2 population to be sorted into three distinct groups based on their marker genotype: M1M1, M1M2, and M2M2. Let $W_{11}$, $W_{12}$, and $W_{22}$ represent the mean fruit weight for F2 plants with marker genotypes M1M1, M1M2, and M2M2, respectively.\n\nThe geneticist wants to determine the mode of gene action at the `q` locus. Which of the following statements correctly describes the expected relationship between the mean fruit weights of the three marker classes for two different genetic scenarios?\n\n**Scenario I:** The `q` locus exhibits purely additive gene action.\n**Scenario II:** The allele for large fruit, q2, is completely dominant over the allele for small fruit, q1.\n\nA.

This marker is tightly linked to a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL), `q`, which influences fruit weight.\n\nFirst, let's establish the genotypes of the different generations.\nThe parental lines are:\n- Line A: M1q1 / M1q1. This line has small fruit. The mean weight corresponds to the q1q1 genotype.\n- Line B: M2q2 / M2q2. This line has large fruit. The mean weight corresponds to the q2q2 genotype.\n\nThe F1 generation is a cross between Line A and Line B, so all F1 individuals will be heterozygous: M1q1 / M2q2.\n\nThe F2 generation is produced by self-pollinating the F1 generation. Since the marker `M` and the QTL `q` are tightly linked, we can assume no recombination occurs between them. Therefore, the F1 individuals produce two types of gametes: `M1q1` and `M2q2`. Random fertilization of these gametes leads to the F2 genotypes in a 1:2:1 ratio:\n- 1/4 of F2 will have genotype M1q1 / M1q1. At the marker locus, this is genotype M1M1. At the QTL, this is genotype q1q1. The mean fruit weight for this group is $W_{11}$.\n- 2/4 of F2 will have genotype M1q1 / M2q2. At the marker locus, this is genotype M1M2. At the QTL, this is genotype q1q2. The mean fruit weight for this group is $W_{12}$.\n- 1/4 of F2 will have genotype M2q2 / M2q2. At the marker locus, this is genotype M2M2. At the QTL, this is genotype q2q2. The mean fruit weight for this group is $W_{22}$.\n\nFrom the problem description, q1q1 results in small fruit and q2q2 results in large fruit. Therefore, we know that $W_{11} < W_{22}$. Now we can analyze the two scenarios for the heterozygote q1q2.\n\n**Scenario I: Additive Gene Action**\nIn the case of purely additive gene action, the phenotype of the heterozygote is exactly intermediate between the phenotypes of the two homozygotes. The effect of each allele on the phenotype is additive. Thus, the mean fruit weight of the heterozygous q1q2 individuals will be the arithmetic mean of the weights of the q1q1 and q2q2 individuals.\nThe M1M2 marker class corresponds to the q1q2 QTL genotype. Therefore, the mean weight $W_{12}$ will be the average of $W_{11}$ (from q1q1) and $W_{22}$ (from q2q2).\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$W_{12} = \\frac{W_{11} + W_{22}}{2}$$\n\n**Scenario II: Complete Dominance of `q2` over `q1`**\nIn the case of complete dominance, the phenotype of the heterozygote is identical to the phenotype of the dominant homozygote. The problem states that `q2` (large fruit) is completely dominant over `q1` (small fruit).\nThis means that individuals with the q1q2 genotype will have the same phenotype (large fruit) as individuals with the q2q2 genotype.\nThe M1M2 marker class corresponds to the q1q2 QTL genotype, and the M2M2 marker class corresponds to the q2q2 QTL genotype. Therefore, the mean weight of the M1M2 group will be equal to the mean weight of the M2M2 group.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$W_{12} = W_{22}$$\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy combining the results from both scenarios, we get:\n- For Scenario I (Additive): $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$\n- For Scenario II (Dominant `q2`): $W_{12} = W_{22}$\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA. Scenario I: $W_{12} = W_{11}$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{22}$ (Incorrect for Scenario I)\nB. Scenario I: $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{11}$ (Incorrect for Scenario II, this would be dominance of `q1`)\nC. Scenario I: $W_{12} = W_{22}$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$ (Incorrect, scenarios are swapped)\nD. Scenario I: $W_{12} > W_{22}$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{11}$ (Incorrect for both scenarios; first part suggests overdominance)\nE. Scenario I: $W_{12} = (W_{11} + W_{22}) / 2$; Scenario II: $W_{12} = W_{22}$ (Correct for both scenarios)\n\nThus, option E correctly describes the expected relationships for both scenarios.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1501642"}, {"introduction": "The ability to detect a QTL is not guaranteed; it depends heavily on the experimental design.
