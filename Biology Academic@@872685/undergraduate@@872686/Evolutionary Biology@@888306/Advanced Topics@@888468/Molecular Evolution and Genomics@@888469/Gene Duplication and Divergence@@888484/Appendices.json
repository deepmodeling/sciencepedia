{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The history of life is written in our DNA. By comparing gene sequences, we can reconstruct ancient evolutionary events. This first practice explores the critical distinction between orthologs—genes separated by a speciation event—and paralogs—genes created by a duplication event within a single genome. Using the classic example of the globin gene family, this problem [@problem_id:1931124] challenges you to act as a molecular detective, using sequence similarity patterns to determine whether a key gene duplication happened before or after the evolutionary split between humans and chimpanzees.", "problem": "Molecular phylogenetic analysis is performed on the globin gene family in humans and chimpanzees. The analysis reveals that the nucleotide sequence of the human alpha-globin gene is significantly more similar to the sequence of the chimpanzee alpha-globin gene than it is to the sequence of the human beta-globin gene. Genes that arise from a speciation event are called orthologs, while genes that arise from a gene duplication event within a single genome are called paralogs.\n\nWhich of the following evolutionary scenarios provides the most accurate explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The human and chimpanzee lineages first diverged from a common ancestor. Subsequently, an ancestral globin gene underwent independent duplication events in each of the two lineages, giving rise to distinct alpha- and beta-globin genes in both humans and chimpanzees.\n\nB. A gene duplication event occurred in a common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, creating an ancestral alpha-globin gene and an ancestral beta-globin gene. Later, a speciation event separated the human and chimpanzee lineages, and the two pre-existing genes were inherited and evolved separately in each new lineage.\n\nC. The alpha-globin gene in the chimpanzee lineage and the beta-globin gene in the human lineage evolved independently from different ancestral genes to perform similar oxygen-transport functions, a process known as convergent evolution.\n\nD. Following the speciation event that separated humans and chimpanzees, the alpha-globin gene was transferred from the chimpanzee lineage to the human lineage via a horizontal gene transfer event, replacing the original human alpha-globin gene.\n\nE. The Beta-globin gene in humans has accumulated mutations at a much faster rate than the alpha-globin gene, causing it to appear more divergent, even though the duplication that created it occurred after the human-chimpanzee speciation.", "solution": "We are given that the human alpha-globin gene is significantly more similar to the chimpanzee alpha-globin gene than it is to the human beta-globin gene, along with the definitions that orthologs arise by speciation and paralogs arise by gene duplication within a genome. The key molecular evolutionary principle to apply is the molecular clock: for homologous sequences evolving at approximately constant substitution rates, the expected sequence divergence is proportional to the time since their last common ancestral gene.\n\nLet $D(x,y)$ denote the expected pairwise sequence divergence between genes $x$ and $y$. Under a simple clock, for two lineages with per-site substitution rate $\\mu$, the expected divergence satisfies\n$$\nD(x,y) = 2 \\mu t,\n$$\nwhere $t$ is the time since their most recent common ancestral gene. More generally, if rates differ between gene lineages, we can write\n$$\nD(x,y) = (\\mu_{x} + \\mu_{y}) t,\n$$\nbut the qualitative conclusion remains that, all else equal, shorter divergence times yield lower $D$ (greater similarity).\n\nThe observation states\n$$\nD(\\alpha_{\\text{human}}, \\alpha_{\\text{chimp}}) < D(\\alpha_{\\text{human}}, \\beta_{\\text{human}}).\n$$\nThis inequality indicates that the time since divergence of the two alpha-globin orthologs across species is less than the time since divergence of the alpha- and beta-globin paralogs within human:\n$$\nt\\big(\\alpha_{\\text{human}} \\text{ vs } \\alpha_{\\text{chimp}}\\big) < t\\big(\\alpha_{\\text{human}} \\text{ vs } \\beta_{\\text{human}}\\big),\n$$\nassuming comparable rates across these globin genes.\n\nThis time-ordering is exactly what occurs if a gene duplication producing ancestral alpha- and beta-globin occurred before the human–chimpanzee speciation. Let $t_{D}$ denote the time of duplication and $t_{S}$ the time of speciation, measured backward from the present. If the duplication precedes speciation, then $t_{D} > t_{S}$, which implies\n$$\nD(\\alpha_{\\text{human}}, \\alpha_{\\text{chimp}}) \\propto t_{S} < t_{D} \\propto D(\\alpha_{\\text{human}}, \\beta_{\\text{human}}),\n$$\nmatching the observation. This corresponds to option B.\n\nNow evaluate the alternatives:\n\n- A: Speciation first, then independent duplications in each lineage. In this case, within human, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ would have diverged only since the human-specific duplication time $t_{D,\\text{human}}$, which is more recent than $t_{S}$, so we would expect\n$$\nD(\\alpha_{\\text{human}}, \\beta_{\\text{human}}) \\propto t_{D,\\text{human}} < t_{S} \\propto D(\\alpha_{\\text{human}}, \\alpha_{\\text{chimp}}),\n$$\npredicting higher similarity within human than across species—the opposite of what is observed. Hence A is inconsistent with the data under a clock.\n\n- C: Convergent evolution implies similar function but does not explain extensive sequence similarity across the entire gene typical of shared ancestry, and it does not account for the clear orthology between alpha-globin genes in human and chimpanzee inferred from the pattern.\n\n- D: Horizontal gene transfer of a nuclear gene between mammalian lineages is exceedingly unlikely and unnecessary to explain the observed ortholog-paralog similarity pattern.\n\n- E: Claiming a much faster mutation rate in human beta-globin while also asserting the duplication occurred after speciation implies $t_{D} < t_{S}$. That would typically predict lower within-human divergence unless rate acceleration is extreme and contrived; moreover, if the duplication were post-speciation, the presence of beta-globin in both species would require independent events. This is not the most accurate or parsimonious explanation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and parsimonious explanation is that a duplication occurred in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees to produce ancestral alpha- and beta-globin genes, followed by a speciation event, with subsequent independent evolution of each orthologous pair in the two lineages.

The answer often lies in the selective pressures they encounter.

A common ancestor of two modern plant species possessed a single gene, `AncR`, which was bifunctional: it played a role in recognizing a specific class of pathogens and also participated in a critical developmental signaling cascade. Following a gene duplication event in the common ancestor, the two lineages diverged.

The ecological context also states a persistent and rapidly evolving pathogen pressure, which is the classic arms race scenario driving adaptive diversification of pathogen-recognition genes. After duplication, one or both copies can acquire novel binding specificities or broaden recognition spectra, i.e., neofunctionalization under positive selection.

The description states that the two paralogs partitioned the ancestral functions such that one specializes in developmental signaling and the other retains pathogen recognition, and both are essential. This partitioning of ancestral functions corresponds to subfunctionalization; once partitioned, each copy is constrained by purifying selection to maintain its subfunction, consistent with $d_{N}/d_{S} < 1$.\n\nExclude alternatives:\n- Gene conversion would not predict $d_{N}/d_{S} \\gg 1$ under arms race; moreover, neutral drift would yield $d_{N}/d_{S} \\approx 1$, not $0.4$.\n- Pseudogenization is inconsistent with essentiality in Pair 2 and with $d_{N}/d_{S} = 2.4$ in Pair 1.\n- Both subfunctionalization does not fit Pair 1’s $d_{N}/d_{S} > 1$ and ecological arms race.\n\nTherefore, the dominant models are: Pair 1: Neofunctionalization (Arms Race); Pair 2: Subfunctionalization, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1931080"}]}
