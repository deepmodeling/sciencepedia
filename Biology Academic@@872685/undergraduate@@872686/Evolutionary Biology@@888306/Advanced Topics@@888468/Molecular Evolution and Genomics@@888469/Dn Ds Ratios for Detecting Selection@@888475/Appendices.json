This practice explores a classic scenario of adaptation to an extreme environment, where you'll use the $dN/dS$ ratio to infer the action of positive selection on a protein crucial for survival. By analyzing this case, you will solidify your understanding of how a $dN/dS$ value greater than one serves as a powerful indicator of adaptive evolution.

Species A inhabits temperate waters, while Species B has recently, within the last few thousand years, colonized a consistently sub-zero Antarctic fjord. The primary adaptation enabling survival in this frigid environment is the evolution of a highly effective Antifreeze Protein (AFP). The biologist sequences the orthologous AFP gene from both species to analyze the evolutionary pressures it has undergone.\n\nThe analysis involves calculating the ratio of the rate of non-synonymous substitutions ($dN$) to the rate of synonymous substitutions ($dS$). A non-synonymous substitution is a nucleotide mutation that alters the amino acid sequence of a protein, while a synonymous substitution does not alter the amino acid sequence. The $dN/dS$ ratio is a classic measure used to detect selective pressures acting on a protein-coding gene.\n\nBased on this biological scenario, which of the following values is the most plausible $dN/dS$ ratio for the AFP gene when comparing Species A and Species B?\n\nA. 0.12\n\nB. 1.00\n\nC. 3.85\n\nD. The ratio cannot be determined without knowing the mutation rate.", "solution": "We define $dN$ as the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site and $dS$ as the rate of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site. The ratio $dN/dS$ is interpreted as follows:\n- If $dN/dS  1$, purifying selection predominates, indicating selection against amino acid changes.\n- If $dN/dS \\approx 1$, evolution is approximately neutral with respect to amino acid changes.\n- If $dN/dS  1$, positive selection predominates, indicating adaptive amino acid changes have been favored.\n\nIn the described scenario, Species B has recently colonized a consistently sub-zero Antarctic fjord and survival depends on a highly effective AFP. This implies that functional changes in the AFP protein were advantageous and likely driven by positive selection during or after colonization. Therefore, when comparing the AFP gene between Species A (temperate) and Species B (Antarctic), an elevated $dN/dS$ ratio greater than $1$ is the most plausible indicator of positive selection acting on the protein-coding sequence.\n\nAmong the options:\n- A. $0.12$ implies strong purifying selection, inconsistent with recent adaptive change for a key survival trait.\n- B. $1.00$ implies neutrality, which is unlikely given the critical adaptive role of AFP in the new environment.\n- C. $3.85$ indicates strong positive selection, consistent with rapid adaptive evolution of AFP function in the Antarctic lineage.\n- D. Incorrect, because $dN/dS$ is a relative measure and does not require knowledge of the absolute mutation rate; it compares rates normalized by site class.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible value is one that reflects positive selection, namely a value greater than $1$, and among the given choices, $3.85$ best matches this expectation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1919925"}, {"introduction": "While a high $dN/dS$ ratio is a hallmark of positive selection, it's crucial to consider alternative evolutionary forces that can produce similar patterns. This problem challenges you to think beyond adaptation and explore how population genetics can influence molecular signatures. You will analyze a scenario where a high $dN/dS$ ratio arises not from positive selection, but from the reduced efficacy of purifying selection in a small population, a key concept from the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution. [@problem_id:1919890]", "problem": "A large, stable mainland population of a species of beetle, `Coleoptera major`, has been studied for decades. Within this population, a gene known as `Detox-7`, which codes for an enzyme that neutralizes common plant-based toxins, is known to be under strong functional constraint. A long-term evolutionary analysis comparing `Detox-7` to its ortholog in a sister species yields a ratio of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) of approximately 0.12.\n\nRecently, a small, isolated population of these beetles was discovered on a remote island, having been founded by a small number of individuals from the mainland approximately 5,000 generations ago. The island environment contains the same plants and thus the same toxins as the mainland. When geneticists sequence the `Detox-7` gene from the island population and compare it to the mainland population's sequence, they calculate a dN/dS ratio of 0.91 for the evolutionary branch leading to the island population since its divergence.\n\nAssuming there is no positive selection acting on the `Detox-7` gene in the island population, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental population genetic explanation for the observed increase in the dN/dS ratio toward unity?\n\nA. The colonization of the island created novel ecological pressures that made previously deleterious mutations in the `Detox-7` gene beneficial, accelerating their fixation.\n\nB. The small effective population size on the island reduces the efficacy of purifying selection, allowing many slightly deleterious non-synonymous mutations to drift to fixation at a rate approaching the neutral substitution rate.\n\nC. The environmental stress associated with the founding of a new population induced a higher rate of non-synonymous mutations relative to synonymous mutations in the `Detox-7` gene.\n\nD. The `Detox-7` gene has lost its function and become a pseudogene in the island population, causing all new mutations to be neutral and fix at the same rate.\n\nE. The rate of synonymous substitution (dS) has been significantly suppressed in the island lineage due to strong selection on codon usage, artificially inflating the dN/dS ratio.", "solution": "Let $\\omega$ denote the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates, $\\omega = dN/dS$. Fundamental interpretations are:\n- $\\omega = 1$ under neutrality, because both non-synonymous and synonymous changes fix at the neutral rate.\n- $\\omega  1$ under purifying selection, because deleterious non-synonymous mutations have reduced fixation probabilities.\n- $\\omega  1$ under positive selection, because advantageous non-synonymous mutations fix more often.\n\nThe mainland lineage shows $\\omega \\approx 0.12$, indicating strong purifying selection on the encoded protein. The island lineage shows $\\omega \\approx 0.91$, approaching unity. The problem states that there is no positive selection and the environment is unchanged, so an increase in $\\omega$ toward $1$ must arise from changes in the efficacy of selection rather than a shift in adaptive pressures.\n\nUnder classical population genetics (Kimura’s diffusion results), the fixation probability of a new mutation with selection coefficient $s$ in a population of effective size $N_{e}$ is approximately\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}}(s) \\approx \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2s)}{1 - \\exp(-4N_{e}s)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2N_{e}}.\n$$\nFor the nearly neutral regime, where $|N_{e}s| \\ll 1$, this reduces to\n$$\nP_{\\text{fix}}(s) \\approx \\frac{1}{2N_{e}},\n$$\nwhich is identical to the neutral fixation probability. Thus, when $N_{e}$ is small, a larger fraction of slightly deleterious non-synonymous mutations (with $s0$ but $|N_{e}s| \\lesssim 1$) behave effectively neutrally.\n\nLet $\\mu_{S}$ be the synonymous mutation rate and $\\mu_{N}$ the total non-synonymous mutation rate.

Meanwhile, $dS$ remains approximately $\\mu_{S}$ because it is already neutral and independent of $N_{e}$. Consequently,\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{dN}{dS} \\to 1 \\quad \\text{as purifying selection efficacy weakens in a small } N_{e}.\n$$\n\nThis is the nearly neutral theory explanation: reduced effective population size weakens purifying selection, allowing many slightly deleterious non-synonymous mutations to drift to fixation, elevating $\\omega$ toward unity without invoking positive selection.\n\nAlternative options are inconsistent with the premises or with fundamental population genetics:\n- A requires positive selection (beneficial mutations), contradicting the assumption of no positive selection and unchanged ecology.\n- C posits a stress-induced shift increasing non-synonymous mutation rates relative to synonymous; mutation pressure alone cannot generally explain a sustained $\\omega$ near $1$ when selection is strong, and there is no basis for a systematic increase in the non-synonymous relative to synonymous mutation rate specific to this gene.\n- D implies pseudogenization, which would yield $\\omega \\approx 1$ due to complete neutrality; this contradicts the continued need for detoxification in the same environment and the observed value being less than exact neutrality.\n- E requires stronger selection on codon usage to depress $dS$, but selection on codon bias is typically weak and becomes less effective as $N_{e}$ decreases; small $N_{e}$ would not strongly suppress $dS$.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is the reduced efficacy of purifying selection in a small effective population size, which increases the fixation of slightly deleterious non-synonymous mutations and drives $\\omega$ toward $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1919890"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond a simple gene-wide average, the $dN/dS$ framework can be adapted to test highly specific hypotheses about protein function.
