This allele is associated with enhanced cold-sensing and metabolic efficiency in sub-zero temperatures. While it's largely believed that this allele evolved uniquely within the polar bear lineage, a competing hypothesis suggests it was acquired via adaptive introgression from an extinct population of Irish brown bears during the last glacial maximum, when their habitats might have overlapped.\n\nTo test this introgression hypothesis, researchers use the Patterson's D-statistic. This statistical test is designed to detect ancient gene flow using biallelic Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from four populations arranged in a specific phylogenetic tree: `((P1, P2), P3), O`. For this study, the populations are defined as:\n- **P1**: A 'control' polar bear genome from the Chukchi Sea, a population geographically isolated from the potential introgression zone.\n- **P2**: The 'test' polar bear genome from the Svalbard archipelago, the population suspected of receiving the allele.\n- **P3**: An ancient genome reconstructed from a subfossil of an extinct Irish brown bear.\n- **O**: A modern American black bear genome, serving as the outgroup.\n\nThe D-statistic is calculated as $D = \\frac{N_{ABBA} - N_{BABA}}{N_{ABBA} + N_{BABA}}$, where 'A' represents the ancestral allele (as determined by the outgroup, O) and 'B' represents the derived allele.\n- $N_{ABBA}$ is the count of sites where the genomic pattern is (P1=A, P2=B, P3=B, O=A).\n- $N_{BABA}$ is the count of sites where the genomic pattern is (P1=B, P2=A, P3=B, O=A).\n\nA large positive D value would indicate an excess of shared derived alleles between P2 and P3, supporting the hypothesis of gene flow between the Irish brown bear and the Svalbard polar bear.\n\nIn a 250 kilobase (kb) genomic window centered on the *TRP-M8* locus, the analysis of SNP data yielded the following site pattern counts:\n- Number of ABBA sites: $N_{ABBA} = 812$\n- Number of BABA sites: $N_{BABA} = 235$\n- Number of BBAA sites (P1=B, P2=B, P3=A, O=A): $N_{BBAA} = 41$\n\nCalculate the value of the Patterson's D-statistic for this genomic region.

The analysis uses the standard four-taxon tree `((P1, P2), P3), O`, where P1 and P2 are sister taxa.

The endemic allele is denoted *Cyp9jX-A* (for Aeridor-adapted), and the ancestral colonizer allele is *Cyp9jX-T* (for Temperatus). Researchers aim to determine whether the adaptive advantage of the introgressed *Cyp9jX-A* allele in the *V. temperatus* background stems from its superior protein structure (catalytic function) or from its co-option into a new regulatory network leading to altered expression levels.\n\nTo quantify this, they model the total detoxification capacity, $K$, of an individual insect as the product of the catalytic efficiency of the CYP9JX enzyme, $k_{cat}$, and the concentration of the enzyme in the relevant gut tissue, $E$. The overall adaptive gain, $\\Delta K_{total}$, is defined as the increase in detoxification capacity of the introgressed *V. temperatus* lineage compared to the ancestral, non-introgressed lineage when both are feeding on *V. noxia*.
