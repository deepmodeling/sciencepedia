This quantity is often denoted as $\\alpha$ (alpha) in population genetics.\n\nLet's define the given quantities:\n- $D_n$: Number of non-synonymous fixed differences between species. $D_n = 28$.\n- $D_s$: Number of synonymous fixed differences between species. $D_s = 7$.\n- $P_n$: Number of non-synonymous polymorphisms within species. $P_n = 15$.\n- $P_s$: Number of synonymous polymorphisms within species. $P_s = 45$.\n\nThe core idea is to compare the observed number of non-synonymous fixations ($D_n$) with the number expected under a purely neutral model. The neutral expectation is derived from the pattern of polymorphism within species.\n\nUnder neutrality, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous sites that become fixed should be the same as the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous sites that are polymorphic.\n$$ \\left(\\frac{D_n}{D_s}\\right)_{\\text{neutral}} = \\frac{P_n}{P_s} $$\n\nWe can use this relationship to calculate the expected number of non-synonymous fixations, $D_{n, \\text{exp}}$, that would have occurred if all of them were neutral.

The difference between the observed number and the expected neutral number represents the number of non-synonymous fixations driven by positive selection, which we can call $D_{n, \\text{adaptive}}$.\n$$ D_{n, \\text{adaptive}} = D_n - D_{n, \\text{exp}} = 28 - \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{84}{3} - \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{77}{3} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the *proportion* of non-synonymous fixed differences attributable to positive selection.

The statistical power of the McDonald-Kreitman test depends heavily on having sufficient genetic variation within the species being studied. This conceptual problem explores a scenario with very sparse polymorphism data, forcing you to consider the statistical constraints of the test and why a lack of data can prevent us from making a confident conclusion [@problem_id:1971663].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is investigating adaptation to cold environments in archaea. They compare the sequence of a heat-shock-like protein gene, *cspA*, between two closely related species: *Pyrococcus fervidus*, which lives in a stable high-temperature environment, and *Pyrococcus algidus*, which has adapted to a colder, more variable thermal niche. The biologist hypothesizes that the *cspA* gene has been under positive selection in the lineage leading to *P. algidus*.\n\nTo test this, they perform a McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test. This test compares the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous changes at two levels: fixed differences between species (divergence) and variable sites within a species (polymorphism). The four categories of sites are: non-synonymous fixed differences ($D_n$), synonymous fixed differences ($D_s$), non-synonymous polymorphisms ($P_n$), and synonymous polymorphisms ($P_s$).\n\nAfter sequencing the *cspA* gene from multiple individuals of *P. algidus* and comparing it to the reference sequence from *P. fervidus*, the biologist obtains the following counts:\n- $D_n = 7$\n- $D_s = 3$\n- $P_n = 0$\n- $P_s = 1$\n\nGiven this specific dataset, what is the most significant and direct limitation the biologist faces when trying to use the MK test to conclude whether the *cspA* gene has been under positive selection?\n\nA. The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous fixed differences ($D_n/D_s$) is greater than one, which is, by itself, conclusive evidence for positive selection, making the polymorphism data statistically irrelevant.\n\nB. The absence of non-synonymous polymorphisms ($P_n=0$) is definitive proof of ongoing purifying selection within *P. algidus*, which invalidates the assumption of neutrality required for the test.\n\nC. The test has very low statistical power to reject the null hypothesis of neutral evolution because the number of observed polymorphic sites is extremely small.\n\nD. The MK test is only valid when the number of synonymous polymorphisms ($P_s$) is substantially larger than the number of non-synonymous polymorphisms ($P_n$).\n\nE. The data indicates a recent population bottleneck in *P. algidus*, which violates the constant population size assumption of the neutral theory upon which the MK test is based.", "solution": "The McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test is a powerful tool in molecular evolution for detecting the signal of natural selection. Its core logic rests on comparing the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations that are fixed between species ($D_n/D_s$) to the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations that are segregating within a species ($P_n/P_s$).\n\nUnder the null hypothesis of neutral evolution, both polymorphisms and fixed differences are subject to the same neutral processes of mutation and genetic drift. Therefore, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous changes should be approximately the same for both categories:\n$$ \\frac{D_n}{D_s} \\approx \\frac{P_n}{P_s} $$\nA significant excess of non-synonymous fixed differences relative to non-synonymous polymorphisms ($D_n/D_s > P_n/P_s$) is interpreted as evidence for adaptive evolution (positive selection), where beneficial non-synonymous mutations have been driven to fixation more rapidly than expected under neutrality.\n\nTo assess the statistical significance of any deviation from the neutral expectation, the data is typically arranged in a 2x2 contingency table:\n\n|             | Non-synonymous | Synonymous |\n|-------------|----------------|------------|\n| Fixed       | $D_n$          | $D_s$      |\n| Polymorphic | $P_n$          | $P_s$      |\n\nA statistical test, such as a chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, is then applied to this table. The purpose of the test is to calculate the probability (p-value) of observing a deviation as large as or larger than the one in the data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n\nIn this problem, the observed data is: $D_n = 7$, $D_s = 3$, $P_n = 0$, and $P_s = 1$. The contingency table is:\n\n|             | Non-synonymous | Synonymous |\n|-------------|----------------|------------|\n| Fixed       | 7              | 3          |\n| Polymorphic | 0              | 1          |\n\nThe central issue here is the extremely low counts in the \"Polymorphic\" row. Statistical tests like the chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test lose their reliability and statistical power when the expected counts in the cells are very small. Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. With such sparse data (only one polymorphic site observed in total), the test has very little power to detect a real effect. Even if positive selection were truly acting, a sample with such low polymorphism would make it nearly impossible to obtain a statistically significant result. The test would likely fail to reject the null hypothesis of neutrality, not because neutrality is true, but because the data is insufficient to make a strong conclusion. This is the most direct and critical limitation presented by this specific dataset.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n- **A:** This is incorrect. The entire premise of the MK test is the comparison between the divergence ratio ($D_n/D_s$) and the polymorphism ratio ($P_n/P_s$). Simply observing $D_n/D_s > 1$ is not sufficient on its own, as this can happen by chance. The test's strength comes from contrasting it with the neutral expectation established by the polymorphism data.\n- **B:** This is an overstatement and misidentifies the primary problem. While strong purifying selection does remove non-synonymous variants (leading to low $P_n$), observing $P_n=0$ in a small sample is not \"definitive proof.\" More importantly, the critical issue is not the biological interpretation of $P_n=0$, but the statistical consequence it has on the test's validity—namely, the loss of power.\n- **C:** This is the correct statement. The small numbers of polymorphisms ($P_n=0, P_s=1$) lead to very low statistical power. This means the biologist cannot confidently distinguish between a true neutral scenario and an adaptive scenario that the test is too weak to detect. This is a fundamental statistical limitation of applying the MK test to genes or populations with very low levels of variation.\n- **D:** This is an incorrect statement. There is no such rule or precondition for the MK test. The relative values of $P_s$ and $P_n$ are the outcome to be analyzed, not a prerequisite.\n- **E:** While a recent bottleneck could explain the low polymorphism, it is an inference about the population's history, not a direct limitation of the statistical test itself. The most immediate problem for the biologist trying to analyze the given numbers is the statistical inadequacy of the data, regardless of the underlying cause.
