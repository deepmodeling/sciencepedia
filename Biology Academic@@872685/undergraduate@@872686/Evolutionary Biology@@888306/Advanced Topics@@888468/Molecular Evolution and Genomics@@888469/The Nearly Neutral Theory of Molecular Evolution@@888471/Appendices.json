This exercise allows you to quantitatively explore this principle by comparing the substitution rates of slightly deleterious mutations in populations of different sizes, resolving a common point of confusion between the strict neutral and nearly neutral models of evolution. [@problem_id:1972266]", "problem": "In an evolutionary biology discussion, two students, Anja and Ben, are debating the relationship between the rate of molecular evolution and population size. Anja, recalling the strict neutral theory, argues that the substitution rate of mutations is independent of the effective population size. Ben, however, brings up the nearly neutral theory, arguing that for a specific class of mutations—slightly deleterious ones—the substitution rate should be negatively correlated with the effective population size.\n\nTo resolve their debate, you are asked to model the situation for two hypothetical species of diploid organisms.\n- Species 1 has a small effective population size of $N_1 = 500$.\n- Species 2 has a large effective population size of $N_2 = 5000$.\n\nBoth species experience the same type of slightly deleterious mutations at a specific gene locus. The mutation rate per gene per generation, $\\mu$, is identical for both species. These mutations confer a selection coefficient of $s = -1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ against heterozygotes.\n\nAccording to population genetics theory, the rate of substitution ($k$) at a locus is given by the product of the total number of new mutations entering the population per generation and their probability of fixation ($P_{fix}$). For a diploid population of size $N$, this is:\n$$k = 2N\\mu P_{fix}$$\nThe probability of fixation for a new mutation with a selection coefficient $s$ is given by Kimura's formula:\n$$P_{fix} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2s)}{1 - \\exp(-4Ns)}$$\n\nUsing this framework, evaluate the students' claims by calculating the ratio of the substitution rate in the large population ($k_2$) to that in the small population ($k_1$).
