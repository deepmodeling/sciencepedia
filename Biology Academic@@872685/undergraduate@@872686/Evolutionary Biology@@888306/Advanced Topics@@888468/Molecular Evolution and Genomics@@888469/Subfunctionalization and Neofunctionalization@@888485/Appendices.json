This exercise presents a classic, textbook case of a duplicated gene in a bacterial population under antibiotic stress. By analyzing the functions of the ancestral and duplicated genes after a period of evolution, you can practice applying the core definition of neofunctionalization, where one gene copy evolves a novel, beneficial function while the other retains the original role [@problem_id:1966587].", "problem": "A population of bacteria possesses a gene, `resX`, which codes for an enzyme that provides resistance to an antibiotic called Tetricycline-A by actively pumping it out of the cell. The function of this enzyme is singular and highly specific to Tetricycline-A. A gene duplication event occurs in one bacterium, which then founds a new lineage. In this lineage, the original gene, `resX`, and the new copy, `resX'`, are both present. This bacterial population lives in an environment that contains both Tetricycline-A and a new, structurally different antibiotic, Chlorophen-B.\n\nAfter many generations of evolution in this dual-antibiotic environment, a genetic analysis of the population reveals the following:\n1. The original gene, `resX`, is preserved and continues to confer effective resistance to Tetricycline-A.\n2. The duplicated gene, `resX'`, has accumulated a series of mutations. These mutations have altered its protein product's substrate specificity, making it an effective efflux pump for Chlorophen-B. However, it has completely lost its ability to pump Tetricycline-A.\n\nWhich of the following evolutionary models best describes the fate of the duplicated gene, `resX'`, in this scenario?\n\nA. Subfunctionalization\n\nB. Nonfunctionalization\n\nC. Neofunctionalization\n\nD. Gene Conservation\n\nE. Concerted Evolution", "solution": "We begin with a gene duplication event producing two paralogs: the original gene $resX$ and the copy $resX'$. The ancestral function of $resX$ is a single, specific activity: active efflux of Tetricycline-A. After evolution in an environment containing both Tetricycline-A and Chlorophen-B, the observations are:\n- $resX$ retains the ancestral function (efflux of Tetricycline-A).\n- $resX'$ accumulates mutations that change substrate specificity so that it effectively pumps Chlorophen-B, while losing the ancestral ability to pump Tetricycline-A.\n\nWe evaluate the standard models of duplicated gene fate:\n- Subfunctionalization requires that the ancestral gene had multiple subfunctions partitioned between duplicates, such that both copies are needed to recapitulate the full ancestral set. Here, the ancestral function was singular, and the full ancestral function is retained entirely by $resX$ alone. Moreover, $resX'$ does not retain a subset of the ancestral function but rather loses it and gains a novel function; therefore, this is not subfunctionalization.\n- Nonfunctionalization is degeneration of the duplicate into a nonfunctional pseudogene. This is inconsistent because $resX'$ has acquired a functional role (efflux of Chlorophen-B).\n- Neofunctionalization is the retention of the ancestral function in one copy and the acquisition of a novel adaptive function in the other, typically facilitated by relaxed constraint on the duplicate followed by positive selection for the new activity. This exactly matches the scenario: $resX$ preserves the ancestral function, and $resX'$ evolves a new, effective function specific to Chlorophen-B while losing the ancestral specificity.\n- Gene conservation implies both copies retain the same original function; this is contradicted by the divergence in substrate specificity.\n- Concerted evolution entails homogenization of duplicates via mechanisms such as gene conversion, leading to similar sequences and functions; this is incompatible with the observed functional divergence.\n\nTherefore, the evolutionary model best describing the fate of $resX'$ is neofunctionalization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1966587"}, {"introduction": "The fate of a duplicated gene is not predetermined but is often a probabilistic outcome of competing mutational pathways. This problem introduces the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, a cornerstone theory explaining the preservation of duplicates via subfunctionalization. You will use a quantitative approach to calculate the likelihood of subfunctionalization based on the relative rates of different mutations, providing a hands-on feel for how population genetics principles can predict the long-term evolutionary trajectory of new genes [@problem_id:1966636].", "problem": "In many organisms, a single ancestral transcription factor gene, let's call it `G_anc`, can control multiple distinct developmental pathways. Consider a scenario where `G_anc` regulates two essential and independent pathways, Pathway 1 and Pathway 2. Following a gene duplication event, two identical paralogs, `G_A` and `G_B`, now exist in the genome, both initially capable of regulating both pathways.\n\nThe long-term fate of this gene pair is often described by the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. According to a simplified version of this model, the duplicate pair will evolve towards one of two stable outcomes, determined by the first mutational event to occur and become fixed in the population.\n\n1.  **Nonfunctionalization**: One of the paralogs (`G_A` or `G_B`) is completely inactivated by a \"silencing\" mutation. The remaining paralog stays fully functional, regulating both pathways. The probability of a silencing event occurring in the pair in any given generation is $P_{\\text{sil}} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n\n2.  **Subfunctionalization**: This outcome is initiated by a \"degenerative\" mutation, which inactivates the regulation of just one pathway in one of the paralogs (e.g., `G_A` loses the ability to regulate Pathway 2). We assume that if such a mutation occurs, it rapidly leads to a complementary degenerative mutation in the other paralog (e.g., `G_B` loses the ability to regulate Pathway 1), resulting in a stable state where both genes are required for survival. The total probability of any such initial degenerative event occurring in the pair in any given generation is $P_{\\text{deg}} = 5.4 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n\nBased on this model where the first event determines the final fate, calculate the probability that the gene pair will be preserved through subfunctionalization.

This practice problem simulates a real-world molecular evolution study, where you must interpret DNA sequence differences to uncover the history of a duplicated gene. By calculating and comparing the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates ($\\omega = d_N/d_S$) between paralogs and orthologs, you will learn how to detect the molecular signature of positive selection, a key indicator that a gene copy has evolved a new function (neofunctionalization) [@problem_id:1966627].", "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying a gene family, \"Kinase Regulator Alpha\" (KRA), in two closely related insect species, *Drosophila ananassae* and *Drosophila pseudoobscura*.
