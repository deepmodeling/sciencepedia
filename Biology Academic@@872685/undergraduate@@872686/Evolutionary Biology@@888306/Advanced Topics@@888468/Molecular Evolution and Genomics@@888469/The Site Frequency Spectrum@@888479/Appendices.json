{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in constructing a Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) is to process raw genetic data from a sample of individuals. This practice demonstrates how to convert genotype information—the count of individuals with two ancestral alleles, one of each, or two derived alleles—into the derived allele count, denoted as $k$. Mastering this conversion is essential for correctly categorizing each genetic variant and building an accurate SFS for downstream analysis [@problem_id:1975020].", "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is studying genetic variation in a remote population of axolotls (*Ambystoma mexicanum*). They are constructing a Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS), which is a distribution of allele frequencies, to understand the population's demographic history. For a specific genetic locus, they analyze a sample of 120 diploid individuals. At a particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) within this locus, they identify the presence of both an ancestral allele and a newer, derived allele.\n\nTheir genotyping results for this SNP are as follows:\n- 105 individuals are homozygous for the ancestral allele.\n- 13 individuals are heterozygous.\n- 2 individuals are homozygous for the derived allele.\n\nTo place this SNP into the correct category of the SFS, the biologists need to determine its derived allele count. What is the derived allele count, denoted by $k$, for this specific SNP in the sampled population?", "solution": "In a diploid sample, each individual contributes two alleles at a locus. The derived allele count, denoted by $k$, is the total number of derived alleles across all sampled chromosomes. For genotype counts, this is computed as\n$$\nk = 2 \\times n_{DD} + 1 \\times n_{AD} + 0 \\times n_{AA},\n$$\nwhere $n_{DD}$ is the number of derived homozygotes, $n_{AD}$ is the number of heterozygotes, and $n_{AA}$ is the number of ancestral homozygotes.\n\nSubstituting the given counts $n_{DD}=2$, $n_{AD}=13$, and $n_{AA}=105$,\n$$\nk = 2 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 13 + 0 \\times 105 = 4 + 13 + 0 = 17.\n$$\n\nAs a consistency check, the total number of individuals is $105 + 13 + 2 = 120$, which matches the sample size.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{17}$$", "id": "1975020"}, {"introduction": "While the unfolded SFS tracks the frequency of the derived allele, determining the ancestral state of a variant is not always possible in real-world studies. This exercise introduces the concept of the \"folded\" SFS, a practical alternative used when ancestral states are unknown [@problem_id:1974998]. You will practice identifying the minor allele count for a given variant, which is the fundamental unit used to build this modified but widely used version of the spectrum.", "problem": "A population geneticist is studying a newly sequenced population of the scaly-foot snail, *Crysomallon squamiferum*, found near a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. The analysis focuses on constructing a Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS), which is a distribution of allele frequencies from a sample of sequenced individuals. The researcher collects a sample of 10 diploid individuals.\n\nIn population genetics, when the ancestral state of an allele at a given genetic locus is unknown, a \"folded\" SFS is constructed. Instead of tracking the frequency of the derived (mutant) allele, the folded SFS tracks the frequency of the *minor* allele (the less common of the two alleles in the sample). A specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) is identified in the sample. At this locus, one allele is observed on 15 of the sampled chromosomes, while the alternative allele is present on the remaining chromosomes.\n\nFor the purpose of constructing the folded SFS for this population, what is the count that should be recorded for this particular genetic variant?", "solution": "The problem asks for the count to be used in a folded Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) for a specific genetic variant.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of chromosomes sampled, denoted by $n$. The problem states that 10 diploid individuals were sampled. Since diploid organisms have two sets of chromosomes, the total number of chromosomes is twice the number of individuals.\n$$n = 10 \\text{ individuals} \\times 2 \\frac{\\text{chromosomes}}{\\text{individual}} = 20 \\text{ chromosomes}$$\n\nNext, we are given information about a specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP). At this locus, there are two alleles. Let's call them allele 1 and allele 2.\nThe count of allele 1, let's call it $i$, is given as 15.\n$$i = 15$$\nThe count of allele 2 must be the total number of chromosomes minus the count of allele 1.\n$$\\text{Count of allele 2} = n - i = 20 - 15 = 5$$\n\nA folded SFS records the count of the minor allele, which is the allele that appears less frequently in the sample. To find the minor allele count, we need to compare the counts of the two alleles and take the smaller value.\nThe counts for the two alleles are 15 and 5.\n\nThe minor allele count is therefore the minimum of these two values:\n$$\\text{Minor Allele Count} = \\min(15, 5)$$\n$$\\text{Minor Allele Count} = 5$$\n\nThus, for this specific SNP, the count that should be recorded in the folded SFS is 5.
