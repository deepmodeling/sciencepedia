This practice models a classic evolutionary scenario where a local population faces a constant influx of maladaptive genes from elsewhere, creating a \"migration load\" [@problem_id:1967216]. By calculating the reduction in this load afforded by an inversion that captures locally adapted alleles, you will appreciate how supergenes can be critical for adaptation in the face of gene flow.", "problem": "A diploid coastal plant species is locally adapted to high-salinity soil. This coastal population continuously receives pollen and seeds from a large inland population of the same species, which is adapted to low-salinity soil. This gene flow occurs at a constant rate $m$, meaning that in each generation, a fraction $m$ of the coastal population is composed of new migrants from the inland population.\n\nThe genetic basis for salinity tolerance involves two unlinked loci, A and B. In the coastal environment, alleles $A_C$ and $B_C$ are adaptive, while the inland alleles $A_I$ and $B_I$ are maladaptive. The inland population is fixed for the $A_I B_I$ haplotype. In the coastal environment, each copy of the $A_I$ allele and each copy of the $B_I$ allele independently and additively reduces the fitness of an individual by a selection coefficient $s$. For example, an individual with genotype $A_C A_I B_C B_C$ has a fitness of $1-s$, and an individual with genotype $A_C A_I B_C B_I$ has a fitness of $1-2s$, relative to the fittest genotype $A_C A_C B_C B_C$ with fitness 1. The baseline recombination rate between locus A and locus B is $r$.\n\nThe constant influx of maladaptive alleles from the inland population creates a \"migration load,\" $L$, defined as the reduction in the mean fitness of the coastal population from its maximum possible value of 1.\n\nNow, consider a scenario where a novel chromosomal inversion arises. This inversion is large enough to encompass both the A and B loci. Importantly, the inversion captures the locally adapted alleles, creating a new chromosomal arrangement, $Inv$, which permanently links the $A_C$ and $B_C$ alleles. Recombination between this new inverted chromosome and the original, standard chromosome is completely suppressed within the inverted region. Assume this new inversion sweeps to a high frequency in the coastal population due to its adaptive advantage.\n\nCalculate the absolute reduction in the migration load, $\\Delta L = L_{free} - L_{inv}$, that is afforded by the widespread presence of this inversion. Here, $L_{free}$ is the migration load in the original population with freely recombining loci (at rate $r$), and $L_{inv}$ is the migration load in the population after the inversion has become common.\n\nProvide your answer as a single, closed-form analytic expression in terms of the migration rate $m$, the recombination rate $r$, and the selection coefficient $s$. You may assume that both $m$ and $s$ are small quantities ($m, s \\ll 1$).", "solution": "The problem asks for the reduction in migration load, $\\Delta L = L_{free} - L_{inv}$, when a chromosomal inversion linking two locally adapted alleles becomes common. The migration load $L$ is defined as $L = 1 - \\bar{w}$, where $\\bar{w}$ is the mean fitness of the population.\n\nFirst, let's establish a general expression for the migration load in this system. With additive fitness effects, the fitness of an individual is $w = 1 - k_A s - k_B s$, where $k_A$ and $k_B$ are the number of maladaptive alleles ($A_I$, $B_I$) at loci A and B, respectively. The mean fitness of the population is $\\bar{w} = 1 - s \\cdot E[k_A] - s \\cdot E[k_B]$. The expected number of maladaptive alleles is $E[k_A] = 2 p_A$ and $E[k_B] = 2 p_B$, where $p_A$ and $p_B$ are the frequencies of alleles $A_I$ and $B_I$. Therefore, the total load is $L = 1 - \\bar{w} = 2sp_A + 2sp_B$. By symmetry of the problem setup, at equilibrium, $p_A = p_B = p$. The load is thus $L = 4sp$. Our task is to find the equilibrium allele frequency $p$ under the two scenarios (with and without the inversion).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the load with the inversion ($L_{inv}$)**\n\nWhen the inversion $Inv$ carrying the $A_C B_C$ haplotype is common, the system can be modeled as a single \"super-locus.\" The native \"allele\" is the adapted $Inv$ chromosome. The immigrant \"allele\" is the standard chromosome carrying the $A_I B_I$ haplotype. Let's call this the $Std_{I}$ chromosome.\n\nGene flow introduces the $Std_{I}$ chromosome at a rate $m$. An individual heterozygous for the inversion and the immigrant chromosome ($Inv/Std_{I}$) has the genotype $A_C A_I B_C B_I$. According to the problem, its fitness is $1 - s - s = 1 - 2s$. So, the effective selection coefficient against the immigrant $Std_{I}$ chromosome is $s_{eff} = 2s$.\n\nWe have a simple migration-selection balance for a single locus with selection coefficient $s_{eff} = 2s$ and migration rate $m$. The equilibrium frequency of the maladaptive $Std_{I}$ chromosome, $p_{std}$, is given by the classic formula for small $m$ and $s$:\n$$p_{std} \\approx \\frac{m}{s_{eff}} = \\frac{m}{2s}$$\nThe load in this single-locus system is given by $L \\approx 2s_{eff} p_{std}$. Substituting the expressions for $s_{eff}$ and $p_{std}$:\n$$L_{inv} \\approx 2(2s) \\left(\\frac{m}{2s}\\right) = 2m$$\nThis is the minimum possible load, as selection acts on the entire maladaptive haplotype perfectly efficiently.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the load with free recombination ($L_{free}$)**\n\nWithout the inversion, the loci A and B are linked with recombination rate $r$. Maladaptive alleles $A_I$ and $B_I$ are introduced together on the $A_I B_I$ haplotype, but can be separated by recombination. To find the load $L_{free} = 4sp$, we need to find the equilibrium frequency $p$ of a maladaptive allele.\n\nLet's model the dynamics using a heuristic approach that focuses on the balance of haplotype fluxes, which is a standard approximation method in theoretical population genetics for small $m$ and $s$. Let $x_{II}$ be the frequency of the migrant $A_I B_I$ haplotype and $x_{IC}$ be the frequency of the recombinant $A_I B_C$ haplotype. By symmetry, the frequency of the other recombinant haplotype $A_C B_I$ is also $x_{IC}$. The frequency of a maladaptive allele is $p = x_{II} + x_{IC}$.\n\nConsider the equilibrium for the migrant haplotype $A_I B_I$. Its frequency is increased by migration at a rate $m$. Its frequency is decreased by selection against both alleles it carries (total selection $2s$) and by recombination, which breaks it apart (at rate $r$). The breakdown by recombination creates recombinant haplotypes. The rate of loss due to recombination is $r D$, where $D$ is the linkage disequilibrium. For small frequencies, $D \\approx x_{II}$. Thus, the balance equation for $x_{II}$ is:\n$$m \\approx (2s)x_{II} + r x_{II} = (2s+r)x_{II}$$\n$$x_{II} \\approx \\frac{m}{2s+r}$$\n\nNow consider the equilibrium for the recombinant haplotype $A_I B_C$. It is created by recombination from $A_I B_I$ haplotypes at a rate of approximately $r x_{II}$. It is removed by selection against the $A_I$ allele it carries, at a rate of $s x_{IC}$. At equilibrium:\n$$r x_{II} \\approx s x_{IC}$$\n$$x_{IC} \\approx \\frac{r}{s}x_{II} = \\frac{r}{s} \\left(\\frac{m}{2s+r}\\right)$$\n\nNow we can find the total equilibrium frequency $p$ of a single maladaptive allele:\n$$p = x_{II} + x_{IC} = \\frac{m}{2s+r} + \\frac{r}{s}\\frac{m}{2s+r} = \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{s}\\right)\\frac{m}{2s+r} = \\left(\\frac{s+r}{s}\\right)\\frac{m}{2s+r}$$\nThe migration load is $L_{free} = 4sp$:\n$$L_{free} = 4sp = 4s \\left(\\frac{s+r}{s}\\right)\\frac{m}{2s+r} = \\frac{4m(s+r)}{2s+r}$$\nLet's check the limits of this expression. If $r \\to 0$ (tight linkage), $L_{free} \\to 4ms/2s = 2m$. If $r \\to \\infty$ (unlinked), $L_{free} \\to 4mr/r = 4m$. These match the known theoretical limits.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the reduction in migration load ($\\Delta L$)**\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the load with free recombination and the load with the inversion.\n$$\\Delta L = L_{free} - L_{inv} = \\frac{4m(s+r)}{2s+r} - 2m$$\nTo simplify, factor out $2m$:\n$$\\Delta L = 2m \\left( \\frac{2(s+r)}{2s+r} - 1 \\right)$$\nNow, find a common denominator for the term in the brackets:\n$$\\Delta L = 2m \\left( \\frac{2s+2r - (2s+r)}{2s+r} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta L = 2m \\left( \\frac{2s+2r - 2s - r}{2s+r} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta L = 2m \\left( \\frac{r}{2s+r} \\right)$$\nThis gives the final expression for the reduction in migration load.\n$$\\Delta L = \\frac{2mr}{2s+r}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2mr}{r+2s}}$$", "id": "1967216"}, {"introduction": "After exploring the genetic consequences and evolutionary advantages of inversions, the next logical step is to ask how we find them in real organisms.

A localized region of the chromosome showing a sharp, two-fold increase in read depth coverage compared to the genomic average, suggesting a copy number variation.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the bioinformatic signatures used to detect chromosomal inversion breakpoints from paired-end sequencing data mapped to a reference genome. Let's analyze the expected mapping patterns for reads originating from a chromosome containing an inversion when they are aligned to a standard, non-inverted reference.\n\nLet the standard reference chromosome have segments in the order `...P-Q-R-S-T...`. An inversion of the `Q-R-S` region would result in a chromosome with the structure `...P-S'-R'-Q'-T...`, where the prime (') denotes the reverse complement of the original sequence. Our sequencing reads come from a population containing both types of chromosomes, and all reads are mapped back to the standard `...P-Q-R-S-T...` reference.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Clusters of read pairs with an everted orientation.**\nThis is a key signature of an inversion. Consider a DNA fragment from the inverted chromosome that spans one of the breakpoints, for example, a fragment that covers the junction between `P` and `S'`. A paired-end read from this fragment will have one read originating from the `P` region and the other from the `S'` region. When mapped to the standard reference:\n- The read from region `P` will map normally to `P`. Let's say it maps to the forward strand (`-->`).\n- The read from region `S'` is a reverse-complement of the sequence in the `S` region of the reference. When the alignment software maps this read to the reference, it will find its correct location at `S`, but its orientation will be flipped relative to a normal read from that region. If a normal forward-reverse pair is `--> <--`, this read from `S'` will also appear as a forward read (`-->`).\nThe resulting pair orientation on the reference genome will be everted, such as forward-forward (`--> -->`) or reverse-reverse (`<-- <--`). Such pairs will cluster at the boundaries of the inverted region, as they arise from fragments that span the breakpoints. Therefore, this is a strong and canonical signal for an inversion.\n\n**B. The presence of \"split reads\".**\nThis is another critical signature that pinpoints the exact breakpoint. A \"split read\" is a single sequencing read that crosses an inversion breakpoint. For example, a read might start in the `P` region and end in the `S'` region of the `...P-S'-R'-Q'-T...` chromosome.\nWhen this single read is mapped to the reference genome (`...P-Q-R-S-T...`):\n- The first part of the read will align perfectly to the end of the `P` region.\n- The alignment algorithm will then fail to extend the alignment into the adjacent `Q` region of the reference.\n- A sophisticated aligner will then search for where the rest of the read might map. It will find that the remaining portion of the read aligns perfectly to the start of the `S` region on the reference, but on the opposite strand (because it came from `S'`).\nThis \"split\" alignment of a single read to two distant locations with a change in strand orientation is a definitive sign of a structural rearrangement, and in this specific configuration, it precisely marks an inversion breakpoint.\n\n**C. Apparent insert size much larger than expected.**\nThis pattern occurs when reads from a fragment flank a region that is present in the reference genome but absent in the sequenced sample. For instance, if region `Q` was deleted in the sample (`...P-R-S...`), a read pair from a fragment spanning the `P-R` junction would map to locations `P` and `R` on the reference. The distance between them on the reference would be `(length of P-to-R) = (original fragment size) + (length of deleted region Q)`. This leads to an anomalously large insert size and is the canonical signature of a deletion, not an inversion.\n\n**D. Read depth coverage at ~50% of the average.**\nA halving of read depth coverage indicates a loss of genetic material. In a diploid organism, if a region is deleted on one of the two homologous chromosomes (a heterozygous deletion), the sequencing depth in that region will be approximately half the average. This is a signature for a deletion, not an inversion, which is a balanced rearrangement (no net loss or gain of DNA).\n\n**E. An outward-facing (reverse-forward) orientation.**\nThis signature (`<-- -->`) is characteristic of a tandem duplication. Imagine a reference `...P-Q...` and a sample with a tandem duplication of `P`, resulting in `...P-P-Q...`. A fragment spanning the new `P-P` junction can result in a read pair where the first read maps to the end of the first `P` (in reverse) and the second read maps to the beginning of the second `P` (in forward on the reference), creating an outward-facing pair. This indicates a duplication, not an inversion.\n\n**F. A sharp, two-fold increase in read depth.**\nA two-fold increase in read depth in a diploid organism suggests that the region exists in four copies instead of the usual two (e.g., a homozygous duplication) or three copies instead of two (a heterozygous duplication, leading to a 1.5-fold increase). In either case, increased read depth is a signature of a copy number gain (duplication), not a balanced inversion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the canonical bioinformatic signatures for identifying inversion breakpoints among the given choices are the clustering of everted read pairs (A) and the presence of split reads with inverted orientation (B).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "1967209"}]}
