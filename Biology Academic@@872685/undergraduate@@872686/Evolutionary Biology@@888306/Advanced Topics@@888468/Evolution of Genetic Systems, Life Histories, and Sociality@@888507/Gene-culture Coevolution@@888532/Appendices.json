This exercise [@problem_id:1932459] investigates how a cultural practice—in this case, a water purification ritual that is not perfectly reliable—can create a state of balancing selection. By analyzing the trade-off between the cost of maintaining a resistance allele and the risk of pathogen exposure when the cultural buffer fails, you will derive the equilibrium frequency for a susceptibility allele, demonstrating how culture can actively maintain genetic diversity within a population.", "problem": "In a large, isolated human population, a waterborne pathogen is endemic. The population has a culturally transmitted water purification ritual that, when performed correctly, renders the water safe and completely protects individuals from the pathogen. However, due to occasional lapses in the ritual's execution, there is a probability $p$ in any given generation that the purification fails, exposing the entire population to the pathogen.\n\nThe susceptibility to this pathogen is governed by a single gene with two alleles, `S` (susceptible) and `R` (resistant), in a diploid organism. The genetic and selective landscape is as follows:\n- The resistance allele `R` is dominant, meaning both `RR` and `SR` genotypes are phenotypically resistant to the pathogen.\n- The susceptibility allele `S` is recessive, meaning only the `SS` genotype is phenotypically susceptible.\n- The `RR` genotype carries an intrinsic, recessive fitness cost $s_r$ (where $0  s_r  1$), meaning its fitness is reduced by $s_r$ in every generation, regardless of the pathogen's presence. The `SR` and `SS` genotypes do not have this intrinsic cost.\n- If exposed to the pathogen (which occurs when the ritual fails), susceptible `SS` individuals suffer a fitness reduction of $s_p$ (where $0  s_p  1$).\n\nTo summarize the relative fitnesses ($w$) of the genotypes in the two possible environmental states:\n1.  **Ritual Succeeds (Probability $1-p$)**: $w_{SS} = 1$, $w_{SR} = 1$, $w_{RR} = 1 - s_r$.\n2.  **Ritual Fails (Probability $p$)**: $w_{SS} = 1 - s_p$, $w_{SR} = 1$, $w_{RR} = 1 - s_r$.\n\nAssuming random mating, a large population size, and that a stable polymorphic equilibrium is maintained, derive an expression for the equilibrium frequency of the susceptibility allele, `S`, in terms of $p$, $s_r$, and $s_p$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the stable equilibrium frequency of the susceptibility allele, `S`. Let's denote the frequency of allele `S` as `q` and the frequency of allele `R` as `1-q`.

Since `p > 0` and `s_p > 0`, this condition is met.\n- `\\bar{w}_{SR} > \\bar{w}_{RR}` because `1 > 1 - s_r`, which simplifies to `s_r > 0`. Since `s_r > 0`, this condition is also met.\nSince the heterozygote `SR` has a higher average fitness than both homozygotes `SS` and `RR`, there will be balancing selection leading to a stable polymorphic equilibrium.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the equilibrium frequency `q_{eq}`.\nAt equilibrium, the change in allele frequency, `\\Delta q`, is zero.
