This plant exhibits a simple trait for pollen grain shape, where the allele for elongated pollen ($P$) is completely dominant over the allele for spherical pollen ($p$). To investigate the genetics of this new species, the botanist performs a standard test cross. A heterozygous plant (genotype $Pp$) is used as the pollen donor (male parent), and it is crossed with a large number of homozygous recessive plants (genotype $pp$), which act as the seed-bearing parents (female parent). According to Mendel's law of segregation, one would expect a 1:1 ratio of the two alleles in the gametes of the heterozygous parent.\n\nAfter the seeds are collected, germinated, and grown to maturity, the botanist examines the resulting progeny. The cross produces a total of 200 viable offspring plants. Among these, 160 plants are found to have developed from elongated pollen (expressing the dominant trait) and 40 plants developed from spherical pollen (expressing the recessive trait). This observation suggests a potential deviation from standard Mendelian inheritance.\n\nBased on these experimental results, calculate the transmission frequency of the dominant $P$ allele from the heterozygous pollen-donating parent. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "We consider a test cross where the pollen donor is heterozygous $Pp$ and the seed parent is homozygous recessive $pp$. By Mendel's law of segregation, the heterozygous parent produces gametes $P$ and $p$. Because the maternal genotype is always $p$, the offspring genotype and phenotype directly reveal which allele was transmitted by the pollen: paternal $P$ yields $Pp$ offspring expressing the dominant trait, while paternal $p$ yields $pp$ offspring expressing the recessive trait.\n\nLet $N_{P}$ be the number of progeny that inherited the dominant allele $P$ (dominant phenotype), and $N_{p}$ be the number that inherited the recessive allele $p$ (recessive phenotype). The transmission frequency of $P$ is the fraction of progeny receiving $P$:\n$$\nf_{P}=\\frac{N_{P}}{N_{P}+N_{p}}.\n$$\nFrom the data, $N_{P}=160$ and $N_{p}=40$, with total $N=200$. Substituting,\n$$\nf_{P}=\\frac{160}{160+40}=\\frac{160}{200}=\\frac{4}{5}=0.8.\n$$\nThus, the dominant allele $P$ was transmitted at frequency $0.8$ from the heterozygous pollen donor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8}$$", "id": "1946750"}, {"introduction": "Observing a non-Mendelian ratio is only the first step; a key scientific question is to identify the biological source of the distortion. This problem [@problem_id:1946783] challenges you to move beyond simple calculation and engage in experimental design.

The dominant allele, denoted as $B$, results in blue iridescence, while the recessive allele, $b$, results in a non-iridescent, black phenotype. From a large number of crosses between heterozygous parents ($Bb \\times Bb$), researchers consistently observe that the ratio of iridescent to black offspring is approximately 1 to 3, a significant deviation from the expected Mendelian ratio. This result suggests the presence of a segregation distorter, an element causing meiotic drive, that acts against the $B$ allele. You are tasked with designing an experiment to determine if this observed transmission bias is occurring during gamete formation in the male parent, the female parent, or both.\n\nWhich one of the following experimental designs is the most direct and effective method for pinpointing the source of the segregation distortion?\n\nA.

To determine whether the bias occurs in male gamete formation, female gamete formation, or both, we must isolate the contribution of each heterozygous parent’s gametes to the offspring phenotype.\n\nLet the probability that a heterozygous male produces a gamete carrying $B$ be $t_{m}$, so the probability for $b$ is $1 - t_{m}$. Similarly, let the probability that a heterozygous female produces a $B$ gamete be $t_{f}$, and for $b$ be $1 - t_{f}$. In a Bb × Bb cross, the probability of a black offspring (genotype bb) is\n$$\nP(\\text{bb}) = (1 - t_{m})(1 - t_{f}),\n$$\nso the iridescent fraction is\n$$\nP(\\text{iridescent}) = 1 - (1 - t_{m})(1 - t_{f}) = t_{m} + t_{f} - t_{m} t_{f}.\n$$\nBecause $P(\\text{bb})$ depends on the product $(1 - t_{m})(1 - t_{f})$, the Bb × Bb cross cannot distinguish $t_{m}$ from $t_{f}$; many pairs $(t_{m}, t_{f})$ yield the same product.\n\nTo directly identify the source of distortion, use reciprocal test crosses with a homozygous recessive (bb) partner so that the phenotype of each offspring directly reports the allele transmitted by the heterozygous parent:\n1) Cross a heterozygous male (Bb) with a homozygous recessive female (bb). The female contributes only $b$, so the offspring phenotype directly reflects the male gamete.

This practice [@problem_id:1946793] shifts our focus from individual crosses to the dynamics of a whole population. By modeling the interplay between a driver's transmission advantage and an associated fitness cost, you will determine the precise mathematical condition under which such a selfish allele can successfully invade and spread.", "problem": "In a large, diploid, randomly mating population, a novel autosomal allele, denoted as $D$, arises. This 'driver' allele exhibits meiotic drive, causing segregation distortion in its favor. In heterozygous individuals ($Dd$), a fraction $k$ of the gametes produced carry the $D$ allele, while the remaining fraction ($1-k$) carry the wild-type allele, $d$. The segregation is biased, so $k > 0.5$.\n\nHowever, the $D$ allele also comes with a fitness disadvantage. It imposes a viability cost on the individuals that carry it. The fitness of wild-type homozygotes ($dd$) is normalized to 1. The fitness of heterozygotes ($Dd$) is reduced to $1-s$, where $s$ is the selection coefficient against the heterozygote ($0 < s < 1$). The fitness of the $DD$ homozygote is not relevant for the initial invasion dynamics in a nearly all-$d$ population.\n\nThe driver allele $D$ can successfully invade the population, which is initially considered to be fixed for the wild-type allele $d$, only if its segregation advantage is strong enough to overcome its fitness cost. This invasion is possible if the segregation ratio $k$ exceeds a certain critical threshold, $k_{crit}$, which depends on the selection coefficient $s$.\n\nDetermine the expression for this critical threshold, $k_{crit}$, as a function of a single variable $s$.", "solution": "To determine the invasion condition for the driver allele $D$, we track its frequency, $p$, from one generation to the next when it is rare ($p \\to 0$). The allele will invade if its frequency in the next generation, $p_{t+1}$, is greater than its frequency in the current generation, $p_t$. The life cycle can be modeled in two steps: viability selection on adults, followed by meiosis with drive in the survivors.\n\n1.  **Viability Selection:** Let the frequency of the $D$ allele before selection be $p_t$. Since $D$ is rare, carriers are almost all heterozygotes ($Dd$), with frequency $\\approx 2p_t$. Their fitness is $1-s$ relative to wild-type $dd$ (fitness 1). After selection, the frequency of the $D$ allele among the survivors who will reproduce ($p_{sel}$) is approximately:\n    $$\n    p_{sel} \\approx p_t(1-s)\n    $$\n    This shows that selection reduces the driver's frequency by a factor of $(1-s)$.\n\n2.  **Meiosis with Drive:** The surviving adults produce gametes. The frequency of the $D$ allele in this new gamete pool ($p_{t+1}$) is determined by segregation. The change in allele frequency due to drive is $\\Delta p_{drive} = (k - 1/2) \\times (\\text{frequency of heterozygotes among parents})$. The parents are the post-selection adults, where heterozygote frequency is $\\approx 2p_{sel}$. The new allele frequency is the post-selection frequency plus the change from drive:\n    $$\n    p_{t+1} = p_{sel} + \\Delta p_{drive} = p_{sel} + (k - 1/2)(2p_{sel})\n    $$\n    $$\n    p_{t+1} = p_{sel} + (2k - 1)p_{sel} = 2k \\cdot p_{sel}\n    $$\n    This shows that drive multiplies the driver's post-selection frequency by a factor of $2k$.\n\n3.  **Invasion Condition:** Combining the two steps, we find the net change across one generation:\n    $$\n    p_{t+1} \\approx 2k \\cdot p_{sel} \\approx 2k(1-s)p_t\n    $$\n    The allele $D$ will invade if its frequency increases ($p_{t+1} > p_t$):\n    $$\n    2k(1-s)p_t > p_t \\quad \\implies \\quad 2k(1-s) > 1\n    $$\n    Solving for $k$ gives the invasion condition:\n    $$\n    k > \\frac{1}{2(1-s)}\n    $$\n    Thus, the critical threshold for the segregation ratio is:\n    $$\n    k_{crit} = \\frac{1}{2(1-s)}\n    $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2\\left(1 - s\\right)}}$$", "id": "1946793"}]}
