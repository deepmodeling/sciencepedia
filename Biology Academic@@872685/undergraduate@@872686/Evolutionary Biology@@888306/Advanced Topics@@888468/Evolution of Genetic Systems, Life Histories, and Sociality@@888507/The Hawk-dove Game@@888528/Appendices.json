Biologists have observed two distinct behavioral strategies during these contests. Individuals exhibiting the 'Hawk' strategy will always fight aggressively to control the resource. Individuals exhibiting the 'Dove' strategy will engage in a display but will retreat without a fight if their opponent escalates.\n\nThe value of controlling a sap flow is represented by a fitness benefit $V$. The cost of injury from a fight is a fitness loss $C$. For any contest, the outcomes are as follows:\n- When a Hawk meets a Dove, the Hawk takes the resource (payoff $V$) and the Dove retreats (payoff 0).\n- When two Doves meet, they share the resource after a brief display, and each receives a payoff of $V/2$.\n- When two Hawks meet, they fight intensely. There is an equal chance of winning or losing. The winner gets the resource (value $V$), while the loser sustains an injury (cost $C$). The expected payoff for a Hawk in a Hawk-Hawk encounter is therefore $(V - C)/2$.\n\nA long-term study of a large, stable population of these beetles reveals that the 'Hawk' strategy is maintained at a consistent frequency of 30% of the population. Assuming that this frequency represents a stable equilibrium where the average fitness of a Hawk is equal to the average fitness of a Dove, calculate the ratio of the cost of injury to the value of the resource, $C/V$.\n\nExpress your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must find the condition under which the 'Hawk' and 'Dove' strategies have equal average fitness payoffs, as this corresponds to the stable equilibrium point in the population. Let $p$ be the frequency of Hawks and $(1-p)$ be the frequency of Doves.\n\nThe average fitness payoff for a Hawk, which we denote as $W_{\\text{Hawk}}$, is determined by its encounters with other Hawks and Doves. A Hawk meets another Hawk with probability $p$ and receives a payoff of $(V-C)/2$. It meets a Dove with probability $(1-p)$ and receives a payoff of $V$. Therefore, the total average payoff for a Hawk is:\n$$W_{\\text{Hawk}} = p \\cdot \\frac{V-C}{2} + (1-p) \\cdot V$$\n\nSimilarly, the average fitness payoff for a Dove, $W_{\\text{Dove}}$, is determined by its encounters. A Dove meets a Hawk with probability $p$ and receives a payoff of 0. It meets another Dove with probability $(1-p)$ and receives a payoff of $V/2$.

Let's multiply the entire equation by 2 to clear the denominators:\n$$0.3 (V-C) + 2(0.7 V) = 0.7 V$$\n$$0.3 (V-C) + 1.4 V = 0.7 V$$\n\nNow, distribute the 0.3 on the left side:\n$$0.3 V - 0.3 C + 1.4 V = 0.7 V$$\n\nCombine the terms with $V$ on the left side:\n$$1.7 V - 0.3 C = 0.7 V$$\n\nNext, we rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving $C$ and $V$. Move the $V$ terms to one side and the $C$ term to the other:\n$$1.7 V - 0.7 V = 0.3 C$$\n$$1.0 V = 0.3 C$$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $C/V$.

This increase in density has two consequences for the competing animals:\n- First, the increased number of individuals competing for the same total amount of resources means that the per-capita value of the resource is halved.\n- Second, the heightened social stress and intensity of competition in the denser environment cause the fitness cost associated with injury from a fight, $C$, to increase by a factor of $\\alpha$, where $\\alpha > 0$.\n\nLet $p^*$ be the stable equilibrium frequency of the Hawk strategy in the initial population, and let $p'^*$ be the new stable equilibrium frequency after the population changes.
