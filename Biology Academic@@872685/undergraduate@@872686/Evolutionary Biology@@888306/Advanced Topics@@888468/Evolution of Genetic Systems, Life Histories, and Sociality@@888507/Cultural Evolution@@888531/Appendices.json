{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Cultural evolution isn't just about what is transmitted, but *why* certain ideas or behaviors are preferentially copied. Our minds use cognitive shortcuts, or 'transmission biases,' to efficiently decide who and what to learn from a sea of cultural information. This first practice [@problem_id:1916590] examines one of the most powerful of these: conformist bias, the tendency to adopt the most common behavior in a group. Understanding this mechanism is key to explaining how social norms, fads, and widespread conventions can arise and stabilize, even without individuals understanding their underlying benefits.", "problem": "In the study of cultural evolution, transmission biases describe the psychological and social factors that make individuals more likely to acquire some cultural variants over others. Consider the following scenarios describing how individuals might adopt a new skill, belief, or behavior.\n\nA sociology student is conducting an observational study on the adoption of a new, complex software tool within a large corporation. The student observes a junior analyst who, faced with choosing between the old, familiar software and the new tool, decides to adopt the new tool. The analyst's decision is not based on copying a specific high-status manager or on the tool's inherent features, which are still poorly understood. Instead, the analyst's choice is driven by the observation that the vast majority of colleagues in the department have already made the switch. The analyst reasons that \"if everyone is using it, it must be the right thing to do.\"\n\nThis change in behavior is a classic example of which type of cultural transmission bias?\n\nA. Direct bias\n\nB. Anti-conformist bias\n\nC. Guided variation\n\nD. Indirect bias\n\nE. Conformist bias", "solution": "We are asked to identify the type of cultural transmission bias illustrated by an individual adopting a new tool primarily because the majority of their peers have already adopted it, without evaluating the tool’s intrinsic qualities (rules out content-based or direct bias), without copying a particular prestigious or successful model (rules out indirect/model-based bias such as prestige or success bias), and without learning via individual trial-and-error modification (rules out guided variation). The behavior also does not involve a preference for rare or minority variants (rules out anti-conformist bias). The defining feature is preferentially adopting the majority behavior because it is the majority. This aligns with conformist bias, where individuals disproportionately copy the most common variant in the population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1916590"}, {"introduction": "While learning biases operate at the individual level, the fate of culture also depends on the structure of the population itself. This next exercise [@problem_id:1916610] explores the crucial role of population size and interconnectedness in maintaining complex knowledge, a concept often called the 'collective brain'. By analyzing a hypothetical but historically plausible scenario of technological regression, you will grapple with the counterintuitive idea that culture can be lost, even when resources and needs remain, simply because a population becomes too small or isolated to faithfully transmit its most complex skills.", "problem": "An isolated island community of a few hundred individuals has been continuously inhabited for millennia. Archaeological excavations reveal that their ancestors, who lived on the same island 5,000 years ago when the population was estimated to be several thousand, crafted sophisticated, multi-part composite fishhooks from bone, wood, and fiber. These tools were highly effective for deep-sea fishing. However, the current inhabitants only possess the knowledge to make simple, single-piece wooden gorge hooks, which are significantly less effective and limit them to inshore fishing. This technological regression occurred despite the ready availability of the same raw materials used by their ancestors.\n\nWhich of the following concepts from cultural evolution provides the best explanation for this loss of a complex technology in a small, isolated population?\n\nA. Cultural Maladaptation\n\nB. Prestige-biased Transmission\n\nC. The Collective Brain Effect\n\nD. Conformist Transmission\n\nE. Guided Variation", "solution": "We are asked to explain the loss of a complex composite fishing technology in a small, isolated population that retains access to the same raw materials but has regressed to simpler tools. The relevant framework is cultural evolution, where the maintenance and accumulation of complex technologies depend on the size and connectivity of the social learning network.\n\nFirst, identify the core mechanism implicated by the scenario. Complex, multi-part technologies require high-fidelity social learning, multiple skilled models to copy, and repeated opportunities to correct transmission errors. In small, isolated populations, the expected number of highly skilled models is lower, and the social network is sparse. This increases the probability that copying errors go uncorrected and that components of the technology are simplified or lost over generations. Without inflow from other groups, lost skills are not replenished. This is the demographic mechanism linking population size and interconnectivity to the maintenance of cumulative cultural complexity, often termed the collective brain effect.\n\nSecond, map this mechanism to the given options:\n- Cultural Maladaptation refers to the persistence of cultural traits that reduce fitness in a given environment, but it does not specifically explain why complex technologies disappear in small populations despite available materials.\n- Prestige-biased Transmission describes preferentially copying prestigious individuals; while it shapes who is learned from, it does not by itself predict systematic technological loss due to small population size and isolation.\n- The Collective Brain Effect asserts that larger, more interconnected populations sustain and accumulate more complex cultural traits because they host more skilled models and richer learning opportunities, while small, isolated groups are prone to loss. This directly fits the observed regression.\n- Conformist Transmission is the bias to adopt the majority behavior; it can stabilize existing traits but does not, on its own, explain why complex technology would be lost absent demographic constraints.\n- Guided Variation involves individuals modifying traits through their own learning or innovation; it does not explain systematic regression linked to demography and isolation.\n\nTherefore, the concept that best explains the loss of complex technology in a small, isolated population is the collective brain effect, which links effective population size and network connectivity to the maintenance of cumulative cultural complexity and predicts technological loss under isolation and small population size.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1916610"}, {"introduction": "To scientifically study the forces driving cultural change, such as selection or bias, we first need a baseline model of how culture would change randomly. This practice [@problem_id:1916581] introduces you to such a null model by adapting the classic Wright-Fisher model from population genetics to study 'cultural drift'. You will mathematically model how two isolated populations, starting with the same cultural frequencies, diverge over time due to chance alone, and see how population size is the critical parameter governing the speed of this divergence. This exercise provides a powerful quantitative lens for understanding the patterns of cultural variation we see in the world.", "problem": "Two ancient villages, A and B, are completely isolated from each other. Each village has a stable population of master potters, with $N_A$ masters in Village A and $N_B$ masters in Village B. In these villages, pottery making is passed down through a simple apprenticeship model that mirrors the Wright-Fisher model of population genetics. Each year, a new generation of potters is trained. Every apprentice in a given village chooses a single master potter from the previous generation in their own village, selected uniformly at random, and learns their complete style.\n\nThere are two distinct, non-functional pottery decoration styles prevalent in this culture: \"Spiral\" and \"Wavy\". Since the styles are non-functional, a potter's choice of style has no effect on their success. At a reference time, generation $t=0$, the frequency of the Spiral style is identical in both villages, given by $p_0$.\n\nLet $p_A(t)$ and $p_B(t)$ be the frequencies of the Spiral style in Village A and Village B at generation $t$, respectively.
