The production of scientific knowledge far outpaces humans’ capacity to absorb and verify it, leading to irreproducibility, redundancy, and difficulty distinguishing truth from falsehood. We propose **SciencePedia**—an open-source, open, human-AI collaborative scientific knowledge base that uses “knowledge points” as its basic unit: structured, verifiable, and dynamically evolving.

- Method: Use long-chain-of-thought (LCoT) reasoning to rapidly generate cross-disciplinary knowledge points and Q&A pairs for cold start [ref needed], build an initial network of interdependencies and a community mechanism, then incrementally expand data sources and application scenarios to drive continual updates and evolution of the knowledge base.

- Current Progress: Generated 4 million Q&A pairs across 200 disciplines, forming 40,000 coarse-grained pages and 200,000 fine-grained pages, with preliminary cross-referencing and community mechanisms established. (https://bohrium.com/wiki, currently a demo; to be renamed to https://bohrium.com/sciencepedia)

- Potential Impact: Provide efficient evidence integration and frontier-scouting tools for research; a foundation for personalized textbook generation in education; and a platform-level, agent-ready knowledge system that can reshape future research paradigms.

### Background & Motivation

- Knowledge Explosion & Trust Crisis: Scientific literature, data, and code are being produced at massive scale; replication crises recur; contradictions and outdated conclusions lack systematic annotation.
  
- Limitations of Existing Systems:
  - Wikipedia: Broad coverage but lacking disciplinary depth and evidence structure;
  - ArXiv / PubMed: Primarily archival, offering no dynamic consensus mechanisms;
  - Scientific knowledge graphs & AI distillation efforts: Some structure, but missing verification-and-evolution functions and robust community co-construction mechanisms, among others.
  
- Opportunity: Through human–AI collaboration (AI extraction & rewriting + expert governance & arbitration), it is possible to reconstruct scientific knowledge and provide a trustworthy foundation for research, education, and society.

- Why Focus on Scientific Knowledge: Science emphasizes repeatability, falsifiability, and controlled experimentation—making it especially suitable for structuring and verification.
