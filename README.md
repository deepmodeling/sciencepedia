**SciencePedia** is an **open, collaborative, and trustworthy scientific knowledge base**, dedicated to building humanity's **"Scientific Knowledge Universe"**. We use **disciplines** as the framework and **knowledge points** as the smallest units, pursuing scientific knowledge that is **accessible, structured, verifiable, and dynamically updated**.

---


We are at an **unprecedented scientific information explosion "singularity"**, where AI is profoundly reshaping paradigms of human learning, cognition, and innovation. We aim to:

- 🛡️ **Reshape humanity's scientific knowledge with rigor, openness, and consensus**
- 🧭 **Build a "Science Navigator" to help explorers locate themselves and understand the big picture**
- 📍 **Generate "Learning Path" to guide everyone to the frontiers of the science**

For this purpose, we have officially launched the **SciencePedia Open Source Project**!

### 🚀 Our Goals
- ✅ Establish **boundaries, structure, and verification mechanisms** for scientific knowledge
- ✅ Support **AI-based and personalized learning path** for research and education
- ✅ Accelerate **AI for Science** to enable autonomous research innovation and scientific discoveries

### 🌈 Our Vision
In the near future:
- Every discipline will have a **complete, verifiable knowledge system**
- Everyone can **freely access accurate, systematic scientific knowledge**
- Everyone can **generate their own learning path** on demand
- Every researcher can **customize their exclusive "scientific database"**
- Every scientific frontier advancement can **automatically integrate into the discipline's evolution**

### 🔧 **Get Started**

| **Scenario** | **Steps** | **Example Outcome** |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **🧑‍🎓 Learning** | 1. Search for "Force Balance in Fluids" → 2. Select **difficulty level** (undergraduate/graduate) → 3. Choose **language** (Chinese/English) → 4. Browse by chapters or knowledge points | Hydrostatic balance + basic applications of the Young-Laplace equation |
| **✍️ Practice** | 1. Go to any knowledge point → 2. Scroll to the "**Practice**" module → 3. Review **classic exercises and solutions** → 4. Start practicing | **Force Balance in Fluids** page: 3 classic questions (e.g., calculating pressure jump using the Young-Laplace equation) + **detailed steps + answers** |
| **💬 Dialogue** | 1. Click the **chat sidebar** → 2. Enter your question → 3. Engage in **real-time discussion** with the large language model | "How is force balance in fluids applied in astrophysics?" → AI provides **step-by-step explanation** + **derivation of the Roche limit formula** |
