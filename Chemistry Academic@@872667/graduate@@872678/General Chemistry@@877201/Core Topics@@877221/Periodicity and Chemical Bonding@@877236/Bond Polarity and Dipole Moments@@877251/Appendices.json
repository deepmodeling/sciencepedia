For a simple diatomic bond, the bond dipole is a function of the partial charges on the atoms and the distance between them (the bond length). In reality, bonds are not static; they vibrate. The vibrational ground state of a bond has a non-zero energy known as the Zero-Point Vibrational Energy (ZPVE).\n\nThe potential energy of a chemical bond is not perfectly symmetric like a simple harmonic oscillator. A more realistic model is an anharmonic potential, such as the Morse potential, which is steeper at short internuclear distances and shallower at long distances. A key consequence of this anharmonicity is that the *average* bond length for a vibrating bond increases as its vibrational energy increases.\n\nConsider two isotopes of hydrogen: protium ($^1\\text{H}$) and deuterium ($^2\\text{D}$).

The dipole moment of $D_2O$ is smaller than $H_2O$. This is because the O-D bond has a greater reduced mass than the O-H bond, resulting in a lower zero-point vibrational energy. In an anharmonic potential, this lower energy state corresponds to a shorter average bond length.\n\nB. The dipole moment of $D_2O$ is larger than $H_2O$.

The dipole moment of $D_2O$ is smaller than $H_2O$.

The dipole moment of $D_2O$ is larger than $H_2O$.
