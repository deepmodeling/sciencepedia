If you choose to give a decimal, round to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fractional bond order of a carbon-oxygen bond in the carbonate ion, $\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}$, derived from the principles of resonance theory. The experimentally determined $D_{3h}$ symmetry of the ion is a critical piece of information.\n\nIn Valence Bond theory, when a single Lewis structure is insufficient to describe the bonding in a molecule, the actual electronic structure is represented as a resonance hybrid, which is a quantum mechanical superposition of several contributing canonical structures. For the carbonate ion, $\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}$, we must first construct the valid Lewis structures. The central carbon atom has $4$ valence electrons, each oxygen atom has $6$, and there are $2$ additional electrons for the dianionic charge, giving a total of $4 + 3 \\times 6 + 2 = 24$ valence electrons, or $12$ electron pairs.\n\nThe three major canonical (resonance) structures that satisfy the octet rule for all atoms are as follows. For clarity, we label the three oxygen atoms as $\\mathrm{O}_1$, $\\mathrm{O}_2$, and $\\mathrm{O}_3$.\n\nStructure I: A double bond exists between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_1$. Single bonds exist between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_2$, and between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_3$. The formal charge on $\\mathrm{C}$ is $0$, on $\\mathrm{O}_1$ is $0$, and on $\\mathrm{O}_2$ and $\\mathrm{O}_3$ is $-1$.\n\nStructure II: A double bond exists between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_2$. Single bonds exist between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_1$, and between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_3$. The formal charge on $\\mathrm{C}$ is $0$, on $\\mathrm{O}_2$ is $0$, and on $\\mathrm{O}_1$ and $\\mathrm{O}_3$ is $-1$.\n\nStructure III: A double bond exists between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_3$. Single bonds exist between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_1$, and between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_2$. The formal charge on $\\mathrm{C}$ is $0$, on $\\mathrm{O}_3$ is $0$, and on $\\mathrm{O}_1$ and $\\mathrm{O}_2$ is $-1$.\n\nThe real structure of $\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}$ is a resonance hybrid of these three structures. The problem states that the ion has $D_{3h}$ point-group symmetry. This symmetry implies that the three oxygen atoms are chemically and physically indistinguishable. A $C_3$ rotation operation, which is a symmetry element of the $D_{3h}$ group, transforms Structure I into Structure II, and Structure II into Structure III. Because these canonical structures are related by a symmetry operation of the molecule, they are energetically equivalent. In resonance theory, energetically equivalent structures must contribute equally to the resonance hybrid. Therefore, the weighting coefficient, $w$, is the same for all three structures. Since the sum of the weights must be normalized to unity, we have:\n$$w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 1$$\nGiven $w_1 = w_2 = w_3 = w$, it follows that $3w = 1$, or $w = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe bond order of a specific bond in the resonance hybrid is the weighted average of its bond order in each of the contributing canonical structures. Let us calculate the bond order for the $\\mathrm{C{-}O}_1$ bond.\n\nIn Structure I, the $\\mathrm{C{-}O}_1$ bond is a double bond, so its bond order is $2$.\nIn Structure II, the $\\mathrm{C{-}O}_1$ bond is a single bond, so its bond order is $1$.\nIn Structure III, the $\\mathrm{C{-}O}_1$ bond is a single bond, so its bond order is $1$.\n\nThe fractional bond order, $BO$, for the $\\mathrm{C{-}O}_1$ bond is the weighted average:\n$$BO(\\mathrm{C{-}O}_1) = w_1 \\times BO_I(\\mathrm{C{-}O}_1) + w_2 \\times BO_{II}(\\mathrm{C{-}O}_1) + w_3 \\times BO_{III}(\\mathrm{C{-}O}_1)$$\nSubstituting the values for the weights and the individual bond orders:\n$$BO(\\mathrm{C{-}O}_1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times 2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times 1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times 1$$\n$$BO(\\mathrm{C{-}O}_1) = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2+1+1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\nDue to the symmetry of the molecule, this same bond order of $\\frac{4}{3}$ applies to the $\\mathrm{C{-}O}_2$ and $\\mathrm{C{-}O}_3$ bonds as well. This fractional bond order indicates that the bonding is intermediate between a single and a double bond, consistent with the experimental observation that all three $\\mathrm{C{-}O}$ bond lengths in carbonate are identical and shorter than a typical $\\mathrm{C{-}O}$ single bond but longer than a typical $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ double bond.\n\nAn equivalent and more direct calculation sums the total number of bonds distributed among the equivalent bond positions. In any of the three canonical structures, there is one double bond (value $2$) and two single bonds (value $1$), for a total bond count of $2 + 1 + 1 = 4$. These four bonds are distributed over three equivalent $\\mathrm{C{-}O}$ positions. The average bond order is therefore:\n$$BO = \\frac{\\text{Total bonds in any canonical structure}}{\\text{Number of equivalent bond positions}} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\nThis confirms the result from the weighted average method.

The $\\text{C}–\\text{O}_2$ bond is a single bond, so its $\\pi$ bond order is $W_{\\pi} = 0$.\nIn structure II, the roles are reversed: for the $\\text{C}–\\text{O}_1$ bond, $W_{\\pi} = 0$, and for the $\\text{C}–\\text{O}_2$ bond, $W_{\\pi} = 1$.\n\nBecause the two resonance structures contribute equally to the resonance hybrid, the actual $\\pi$ bond order for any one of the $\\text{C}–\\text{O}$ bonds is the statistical average of its value across these structures. The weighting factor for each equivalent structure is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, for the $\\text{C}–\\text{O}_1$ bond (and by symmetry, for the $\\text{C}–\\text{O}_2$ bond as well), the average $\\pi$ bond order is:\n$$W_{\\pi} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times 1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times 0 = 0.5$$\nThe total Wiberg bond index for each of the symmetry-equivalent $\\text{C}–\\text{O}$ bonds in acetate is the sum of the $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ contributions:\n$$W_{\\text{C-O, acetate}} = W_{\\sigma} + W_{\\pi} = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5$$\n\nNext, we analyze acetic acid, $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{COOH}$.

This exercise integrates qualitative resonance analysis with quantitative thermodynamic data, demonstrating how fundamental electronic effects govern macroscopic chemical properties.", "problem": "In electrophilic aromatic substitution, the relative rates and orientations of substitution are governed by the stability of the carbocationic sigma-complexes (also called Wheland intermediates) formed after the rate-determining electrophile addition to the aromatic ring. In valence-bond terms, the stability of such intermediates is increased when positive charge can be delocalized over more atoms through contributing resonance structures, and decreased when resonance structures generate high-energy arrangements such as adjacent like charges.

Analysis of Directing Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution**\n\nThe substituent on the benzene ring dictates the orientation of substitution by its ability to stabilize or destabilize the cationic Wheland intermediate.\n\n- **Aniline ($\\mathrm{C_6H_5NH_2}$)**: The amino group, $-\\mathrm{NH}_2$, possesses a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. This lone pair can be delocalized into the $\\pi$ system of the aromatic ring through resonance (a $+\\mathrm{R}$ or $+\\mathrm{M}$ effect). This delocalization increases the electron density on the ring, particularly at the *ortho* and *para* positions. Consequently, the $-\\mathrm{NH}_2$ group is a strong activating group and directs electrophiles to the *ortho* and *para* positions. The intermediates for *ortho* and *para* attack are especially stabilized because the positive charge can be delocalized onto the nitrogen atom, forming a resonance structure where all second-row atoms have a complete octet.\n\n- **Anilinium ($\\mathrm{C_6H_5NH_3^+}$)**: The problem states that under strongly acidic conditions, the amine is protonated to form the anilinium ion. In the $-\\mathrm{NH}_3^+$ group, the nitrogen atom has no lone pair available for resonance donation. Instead, the positive charge on the highly electronegative nitrogen atom makes the group strongly electron-withdrawing via the inductive effect ($-\\mathrm{I}$). This powerful inductive withdrawal deactivates the entire aromatic ring toward electrophilic attack. The positive charge of the anilinium group destabilizes the positive charge of the Wheland intermediate. This destabilization is most severe for *ortho* and *para* attack, where the intermediate's positive charge is placed on a carbon adjacent to the positively charged nitrogen. For *meta* attack, the positive charges are never adjacent in any of the principal resonance contributors, making this the least destabilized (or \"least disfavored\") pathway. Therefore, the $-\\mathrm{NH}_3^+$ group is a strong deactivating group and is *meta*-directing.\n\n**2. Thermodynamic Analysis of Basicity**\n\nThe basicity of a base $\\mathrm{B}$ in water is quantified by the equilibrium constant for the reaction $\\mathrm{B} + \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{BH}^+ + \\mathrm{OH}^-$. However, the problem frames it through the protonation reaction $\\mathrm{B} + \\mathrm{H}^+ \\to \\mathrm{BH}^+$ and the $pK_\\mathrm{a}$ of the conjugate acid $\\mathrm{BH}^+$. A stronger base will have a more stable conjugate acid and/or a less stable free base, leading to a more favorable (more negative) $\\Delta G^\\circ$ for protonation.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for protonation, $K_{prot}$, is the reciprocal of the acid dissociation constant of the conjugate acid, $K_a$.\n$$K_{prot} = \\frac{1}{K_a}$$\nThe standard Gibbs free energy of protonation is given by:\n$$\\Delta G^\\circ_{prot} = -RT \\ln K_{prot} = -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{K_a}\\right) = RT \\ln K_a$$\nSince $pK_a = -\\log_{10} K_a$, it follows that $\\ln K_a = -\\ln(10) \\times pK_a \\approx -2.303 \\times pK_a$.\nThus, the formula for calculation is:\n$$\\Delta G^\\circ_{prot} = -2.303 RT \\times pK_a$$\n\nLet us calculate this value for aniline and cyclohexylamine. The term $2.303 RT$ at $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ is:\n$$2.303 \\times (8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\approx 5705.8\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}$$\n\n- For aniline: $pK_a = 4.6$\n$$\\Delta G^\\circ_{prot}(\\text{aniline}) = - (5705.8\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}) \\times (4.6) \\approx -26247\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}} \\approx -26.2\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$$\n\n- For cyclohexylamine: $pK_a = 10.7$\n$$\\Delta G^\\circ_{prot}(\\text{cyclohexylamine}) = - (5705.8\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}) \\times (10.7) \\approx -61052\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}} \\approx -61.1\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$$\n\nThe difference in standard protonation free energies is:\n$$\\Delta(\\Delta G^\\circ_{prot}) = \\Delta G^\\circ_{prot}(\\text{aniline}) - \\Delta G^\\circ_{prot}(\\text{cyclohexylamine})$$\n$$\\Delta(\\Delta G^\\circ_{prot}) \\approx (-26.2\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}) - (-61.1\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}) = +34.9\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$$\nThe standard free energy of protonation of aniline is approximately $35\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$ higher (less favorable) than that of cyclohexylamine. This confirms that aniline is a significantly weaker base.\n\nThe physical reason for this difference is rooted in resonance. The free base of aniline is stabilized by the delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair into the aromatic ring. Upon protonation to form the anilinium ion, this resonance stabilization is lost. In contrast, the lone pair in cyclohexylamine is localized on the nitrogen, and there is no significant resonance stabilization to be lost upon protonation. Therefore, the energetic \"cost\" of protonating aniline is much higher, accounting for its weaker basicity.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A.
