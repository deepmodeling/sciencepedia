The valence atomic orbitals (AOs) are the $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals. According to the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) method, these AOs combine to form MOs of gerade ($g$, symmetric with respect to inversion) and ungerade ($u$, antisymmetric with respect to inversion) symmetry.\n\nThe two $2s$ AOs combine to form a bonding $\\sigma_{g,2s}$ MO and an antibonding $\\sigma_{u,2s}^*$ MO.\nThe six $2p$ AOs (three from each atom) combine to form six MOs. The two $2p_z$ AOs, oriented along the internuclear axis, combine to form a bonding $\\sigma_{g,2p}$ MO and an antibonding $\\sigma_{u,2p}^*$ MO. The four $2p_x$ and $2p_y$ AOs, oriented perpendicular to the axis, combine to form two degenerate bonding $\\pi_{u,2p}$ MOs and two degenerate antibonding $\\pi_{g,2p}^*$ MOs.\n\nA critical aspect for the diatomics up to $\\mathrm{N_2}$ is the phenomenon of $s$-$p$ mixing. MOs of the same symmetry can interact, or \"mix\". In this system, the $\\sigma_g$ MOs derived from the $2s$ and $2p_z$ AOs (namely, $\\sigma_{g,2s}$ and $\\sigma_{g,2p}$) possess the same symmetry. This interaction leads to a stabilization (energy lowering) of the lower-energy $\\sigma_{g,2s}$ MO and a destabilization (energy raising) of the higher-energy $\\sigma_{g,2p}$ MO. The magnitude of this interaction is inversely proportional to the energy difference between the parent $2s$ and $2p$ AOs.\n\nFor elements early in the second period, such as Boron (B), Carbon (C), and Nitrogen (N), the effective nuclear charge is relatively low, and the energy gap between the $2s$ and $2p$ AOs is small. Consequently, $s$-$p$ mixing is substantial. The resulting destabilization of the $\\sigma_{g,2p}$ MO is significant enough to raise its energy above that of the $\\pi_{u,2p}$ MOs, which are unaffected by this mixing as they possess $\\pi_u$ symmetry.
