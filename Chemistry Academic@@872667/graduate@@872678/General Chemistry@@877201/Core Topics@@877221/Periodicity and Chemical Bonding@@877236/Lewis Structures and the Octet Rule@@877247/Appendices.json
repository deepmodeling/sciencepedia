The species $\\mathrm{NO_3^-}$ is a common polyatomic ion. The definitions provided for formal charge and the procedure for drawing Lewis structures are standard and fundamentally sound. There are no violations of scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary definitions and constraints to proceed. The tasks are sequential and logically connected, leading to a unique, well-defined final answer.

Terms like \"octet rule,\" \"formal charge,\" and \"resonance hybrid\" are used in their conventional scientific context.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is therefore deemed **valid**. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the four parts of the problem in sequence.\n\nPart 1: Total Valence Electrons and Octet-Obeying Resonance Structures\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of valence electrons, $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, available for bonding. The valence electron counts for the neutral atoms are $5$ for nitrogen ($\\mathrm{N}$, Group $15$) and $6$ for oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}$, Group $16$). The ion has a charge of $-1$, which corresponds to one additional electron.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{tot}} = (\\text{valence } e^- \\text{ from N}) + 3 \\times (\\text{valence } e^- \\text{ from O}) + (\\text{charge}) $$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5 + 3 \\times 6 + 1 = 5 + 18 + 1 = 24$$\nSo, there are $24$ valence electrons to be distributed in the structure.\n\nTo construct the Lewis structures, we begin by placing the central nitrogen atom and forming single bonds to the three oxygen atoms. This requires $3 \\times 2 = 6$ electrons, leaving $24 - 6 = 18$ electrons.\n\nWe must satisfy the octet rule for all atoms. If we distribute the remaining $18$ electrons as lone pairs on the three terminal oxygen atoms ($6$ electrons per oxygen), each oxygen atom will have $1$ bond pair and $3$ lone pairs, thus satisfying its octet ($2 + 6 = 8$ electrons). However, the central nitrogen atom would only have $3$ single bonds, for a total of $6$ valence electrons, failing to satisfy its octet.\n\nTo satisfy the octet rule for nitrogen, a double bond must be formed. This is achieved by converting a lone pair from one of the oxygen atoms into a bonding pair with the nitrogen atom. This results in a structure where the central nitrogen atom has one double bond and two single bonds, for a total of $4$ bonds ($8$ electrons), satisfying its octet. The oxygen atom forming the double bond now has $2$ lone pairs and $2$ bonding pairs, also satisfying its octet ($4+4=8$ electrons). The two singly bonded oxygen atoms each retain $3$ lone pairs and $1$ bonding pair, satisfying their octets ($6+2=8$ electrons).\n\nSince the double bond can be formed with any of the three equivalent oxygen atoms, there are three distinct resonance forms that satisfy the octet rule for all atoms.\n\nPart 2: Formal Charge Calculation\n\nThe formal charge ($FC$) on an atom is calculated using the formula:\n$$FC = (\\text{valence } e^-) - (\\text{nonbonding } e^-) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{bonding } e^-)$$\n\nWe apply this formula to one of the resonance structures. The other two structures will yield the same set of formal charges distributed differently. Let $\\mathrm{O}_{d}$ be the double-bonded oxygen and $\\mathrm{O}_{s}$ be a single-bonded oxygen.\n\n- For the central Nitrogen atom ($\\mathrm{N}$): Valence $e^- = 5$, nonbonding $e^- = 0$, bonding $e^- = 8$ ($1$ double bond, $2$ single bonds).\n$$FC_{\\mathrm{N}} = 5 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = +1$$\n\n- For the double-bonded Oxygen atom ($\\mathrm{O}_{d}$): Valence $e^- = 6$, nonbonding $e^- = 4$, bonding $e^- = 4$.\n$$FC_{\\mathrm{O}_{d}} = 6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$$\n\n- For each of the two single-bonded Oxygen atoms ($\\mathrm{O}_{s}$): Valence $e^- = 6$, nonbonding $e^- = 6$, bonding $e^- = 2$.\n$$FC_{\\mathrm{O}_{s}} = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$$\n\nFor each of the three resonance structures, the formal charges are: $+1$ on the nitrogen atom, $0$ on one oxygen atom, and $-1$ on the other two oxygen atoms. The sum of the formal charges is $(+1) + (0) + (-1) + (-1) = -1$, which correctly corresponds to the overall charge of the ion.\n\nPart 3: Minimization of Charge Separation, $S$\n\nThe charge separation metric, $S$, is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the formal charges on all atoms in a structure: $S = \\sum_{\\text{atoms}} |FC|$.\n\nFor any of the three octet-obeying resonance structures, the value of $S$ is:\n$$S = |FC_{\\mathrm{N}}| + |FC_{\\mathrm{O}_{d}}| + 2 \\times |FC_{\\mathrm{O}_{s}}|$$\n$$S = |+1| + |0| + 2 \\times |-1| = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3$$\n\nSince the set of valid resonance forms under the problem's constraints consists only of these three structures, and they all have the same $S$ value of $3$, all three of them represent the minimized charge separation. There is no other structure within the allowed set that has a smaller $S$.\n\nPart 4: Average Formal Charge on Oxygen\n\nThe problem states that the resonance hybrid is the equal-weighted average of the resonance forms that minimize $S$. As established, all three resonance structures minimize $S$. Thus, the resonance hybrid is an equal-weighted superposition of these three forms.\n\nTo find the average formal charge on a single oxygen atom, we can consider any one of the three oxygen positions (say, $\\mathrm{O}_1$) and average its formal charge across the three resonance structures.\n- In Structure 1 (double bond to $\\mathrm{O}_1$), $FC_{\\mathrm{O}_1} = 0$.\n- In Structure 2 (double bond to $\\mathrm{O}_2$), $FC_{\\mathrm{O}_1} = -1$.\n- In Structure 3 (double bond to $\\mathrm{O}_3$), $FC_{\\mathrm{O}_1} = -1$.\n\nThe average formal charge on an oxygen atom is therefore:\n$$\\text{Average } FC_{\\mathrm{O}} = \\frac{(0) + (-1) + (-1)}{3} = \\frac{-2}{3}$$\n\nBy symmetry, this result is identical for all three oxygen atoms. Alternatively, one can observe that in any of the resonance structures, the total formal charge distributed across the three oxygen atoms is consistently $(0) + (-1) + (-1) = -2$. In the resonance hybrid, this total charge of $-2$ is distributed equally among the three equivalent oxygen atoms, yielding an average charge of $-\\frac{2}{3}$ per oxygen atom. The problem requires the answer as an exact fraction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}\n$$", "id": "2944015"}, {"introduction": "Beyond describing the structure of a single molecule, Lewis theory is a powerful predictive tool for assessing the relative stability of different atomic arrangements.

This leads to three possible resonance structures:\n\n1.  Structure I: $[:\\ddot{\\mathrm{N}}=\\mathrm{C}=\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}:]^{-}$\n    - Octets: All atoms have $8$ electrons.\n    - Formal Charges:\n        - $\\text{FC}(\\mathrm{N}) = 5 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = -1$\n        - $\\text{FC}(\\mathrm{C}) = 4 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 0$\n        - $\\text{FC}(\\mathrm{O}) = 6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$\n    - This is a reasonable contributor, with a single negative charge on the nitrogen atom.\n\n2.  Structure II: $[:\\mathrm{N}\\equiv\\mathrm{C}-\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}:]^{-}$\n    - Octets: All atoms have $8$ electrons.\n    - Formal Charges:\n        - $\\text{FC}(\\mathrm{N}) = 5 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(6) = 0$\n        - $\\text{FC}(\\mathrm{C}) = 4 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 0$\n        - $\\text{FC}(\\mathrm{O}) = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$\n    - This is an excellent contributor. The formal charges are minimized (only one non-zero charge), and the negative charge is located on oxygen, the most electronegative atom.\n\n3.  Structure III: $[:\\ddot{\\mathrm{N}}-\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{O}:]^{-}$\n    - Octets: All atoms have $8$ electrons.\n    - Formal Charges:\n        - $\\text{FC}(\\mathrm{N}) = 5 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -2$\n        - $\\text{FC}(\\mathrm{C}) = 4 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 0$\n        - $\\text{FC}(\\mathrm{O}) = 6 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(6) = +1$\n    - This structure is a very minor contributor due to the large magnitude of formal charges ($-2$) and the placement of a positive formal charge on the most electronegative atom, oxygen.\n\n**Conclusion for $\\mathrm{NCO^{-}}$**: The dominant resonance contributor is Structure II, $[:\\mathrm{N}\\equiv\\mathrm{C}-\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}:]^{-}$, as it minimizes formal charges and places the required negative charge on the most electronegative atom. Structure I is also a significant contributor. The overall resonance hybrid is very stable.\n\n**Analysis of the $\\mathrm{CNO^{-}}$ Connectivity ($\\mathrm{C-N-O}$)**\n\nAgain, we arrange $16$ valence electrons to satisfy the octet rule.\n\n1.  Structure IV: $[:\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{N}-\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}:]^{-}$\n    - Octets: All atoms have $8$ electrons.\n    - Formal Charges:\n        - $\\text{FC}(\\mathrm{C}) = 4 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(6) = -1$\n        - $\\text{FC}(\\mathrm{N}) = 5 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = +1$\n        - $\\text{FC}(\\mathrm{O}) = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$\n    - This structure suffers from significant charge separation and has three atoms with non-zero formal charges.\n\n2.

It has an extremely large formal charge on carbon ($-3$) and places a positive charge on the most electronegative atom, oxygen.\n\n**Conclusion for $\\mathrm{CNO^{-}}$**: All possible resonance structures for the $\\mathrm{CNO^{-}}$ connectivity that satisfy the octet rule are characterized by large formal charges and/or significant charge separation. There is no single \"dominant\" contributor that is remotely as stable as the best contributors for $\\mathrm{NCO^{-}}$.\n\n**Overall Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nThe $\\mathrm{NCO^{-}}$ connectivity allows for a resonance hybrid described by two major contributors, one of which ($[:\\mathrm{N}\\equiv\\mathrm{C}-\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}:]^{-}$) is exceptionally stable based on formal charge rules. In contrast, the $\\mathrm{CNO^{-}}$ connectivity yields only highly unstable Lewis structures with large, unfavorably distributed formal charges. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{NCO^{-}}$ connectivity is overwhelmingly favored.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\mathrm{NCO^{-}}$ is favored because a dominant contributor $\\mathrm{N\\equiv C-O^{-}}$ satisfies octets for all three atoms, yields a single formal charge of $-1$ localized on $\\mathrm{O}$ (with $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{N}$ both $0$), and aligns the negative charge with the most electronegative atom.**\nMy analysis supports every part of this statement. $\\mathrm{NCO^{-}}$ is the favored connectivity. The Lewis structure $[:\\mathrm{N}\\equiv\\mathrm{C}-\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}:]^{-}$ is the dominant contributor. It satisfies all octets. Its formal charges are indeed $\\mathrm{FC}(\\mathrm{N})=0$, $\\mathrm{FC}(\\mathrm{C})=0$, and $\\mathrm{FC}(\\mathrm{O})=-1$. This correctly places the negative charge on the most electronegative atom, $\\mathrm{O}$. The justification is precise and correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\mathrm{CNO^{-}}$ is favored because a dominant contributor $\\mathrm{^{-}C\\equiv N-O^{-}}$ distributes the negative charge over two atoms, enhancing delocalization; any positive charge resides on $\\mathrm{N}$, which is sufficiently electronegative to stabilize it.**\nThis statement erroneously claims that $\\mathrm{CNO^{-}}$ is favored. My analysis shows it is highly disfavored. The specified structure, corresponding to Structure IV ($[:\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{N}-\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}:]^{-}$), has formal charges of $-1$ on $\\mathrm{C}$, $+1$ on $\\mathrm{N}$, and $-1$ on $\\mathrm{O}$. To describe this as a simple \"distribution of negative charge\" is misleading; it is a case of severe charge separation, which is destabilizing. The argument that nitrogen can stabilize a positive charge is weak and irrelevant when a vastly superior isomeric structure ($\\mathrm{NCO^{-}}$) exists that avoids such unfavorable charge distributions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $\\mathrm{NCO^{-}}$ and $\\mathrm{CNO^{-}}$ are equally favored because both can be drawn to satisfy octets and each features a linear arrangement with comparable resonance delocalization across $\\mathrm{O}$, $\\mathrm{C}$, and $\\mathrm{N}$.**\nThis statement's premise of equal favorability is false. While octets can be satisfied for both, the resulting charge distributions are not \"comparable\" in stability. The resonance contributors for $\\mathrm{NCO^{-}}$ are vastly superior to those for $\\mathrm{CNO^{-}}$. The energy difference between the isocyanate and fulminate anions is substantial, with isocyanate being much more stable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $\\mathrm{CNO^{-}}$ is favored because it allows a dominant contributor with a $\\mathrm{N\\equiv O}$ triple bond, which is strongest and therefore stabilizes the anion regardless of formal charge placement.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, it incorrectly favors $\\mathrm{CNO^{-}}$. Second, it identifies a \"dominant contributor\" with a $\\mathrm{N\\equiv O}$ triple bond (Structure VI). My analysis showed this structure to be the *least* stable due to its catastrophic formal charges ($\\mathrm{FC}(\\mathrm{C})=-3$, $\\mathrm{FC}(\\mathrm{N})=+1$, $\\mathrm{FC}(\\mathrm{O})=+1$).

There are no identifiable flaws. It is **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe core of the problem is to explain why carbon monoxide ($\\mathrm{CO}$), despite oxygen being significantly more electronegative than carbon, has a small permanent dipole moment with the negative pole on the carbon atom. This requires moving beyond simple models to a more sophisticated description provided by Molecular Orbital (MO) theory.\n\n1.  **Conflict between Simple Models and Experiment**:\n    -   **Lewis Structure and Formal Charge**: The Lewis structure that provides an octet for both atoms is $:C \\equiv O:$. Calculation of formal charges gives:\n        $$ \\mathrm{FC_C} = 4 - (2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6) = -1 $$\n        $$ \\mathrm{FC_O} = 6 - (2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6) = +1 $$\n        This representation, $\\mathrm{C^- \\equiv O^+}$, suggests a significant dipole moment with the negative end on carbon.\n    -   **Electronegativity**: Oxygen is much more electronegative than carbon. This would suggest that the shared electrons in the covalent bonds should be polarized towards oxygen, creating a charge distribution of the form $\\mathrm{C^{\\delta+} - O^{\\delta-}}$. This would lead to a dipole moment pointing from carbon to oxygen.\n    -   **Experimental Fact**: The measured dipole moment is small ($0.11$ Debye) and points from oxygen to carbon (negative end on C).\n\n2.  **Reconciliation using Molecular Orbital Theory**:\n    The discrepancy is resolved by considering the contributions of all occupied molecular orbitals to the overall electron distribution.\n    -   **MO Formation**: The AOs of carbon and oxygen combine to form MOs. Because oxygen is more electronegative, its AOs ($2s_{\\mathrm{O}}, 2p_{\\mathrm{O}}$) are lower in energy than the corresponding carbon AOs ($2s_{\\mathrm{C}}, 2p_{\\mathrm{C}}$).\n    -   **Polarization of Bonding Orbitals**: When AOs combine, the resulting bonding MO is closer in energy to the lower-energy AO and thus has more character from that atom. Therefore, all bonding MOs in $\\mathrm{CO}$ (the $\\sigma$ and two $\\pi$ bonding orbitals) are polarized towards oxygen. This distribution of electrons contributes to a dipole moment pointing towards oxygen ($\\mathrm{C \\to O}$).\n    -   **The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO)**: In $\\mathrm{CO}$ (as in $\\mathrm{N_2}$), significant mixing occurs between the $2s$ and $2p_z$ orbitals (s-p mixing). This effect is strong enough to push the energy of the upper $\\sigma$ MO (labeled $5\\sigma$ or $3\\sigma_{\\text{valence}}$) above the energy of the $\\pi$ bonding orbitals. This $5\\sigma$ orbital becomes the HOMO. Crucially, due to its energy and the specifics of s-p mixing, this HOMO is predominantly a non-bonding orbital localized on the carbon atom, resembling a lone pair pointing away from the oxygen atom.\n    -   **Opposing Dipole Contributions**: The total dipole moment is the vector sum of contributions from all occupied orbitals.\n        -   The electron density in the three bonding orbitals ($\\sigma$ and two $\\pi$) is polarized toward oxygen, creating a dipole moment component $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\text{bonds}}$ directed $\\mathrm{C \\to O}$.\n        -   The electron density in the HOMO ($5\\sigma$) is largely a lone pair on carbon, creating a significant dipole moment component $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\text{HOMO}}$ directed $\\mathrm{O \\to C}$.\n    -   **Net Dipole Moment**: The two main contributions, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\text{bonds}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\text{HOMO}}$, point in opposite directions. The small magnitude of the experimental dipole moment indicates that these opposing contributions nearly cancel each other out. The fact that the net negative pole is on carbon means that the contribution from the carbon-localized HOMO is slightly larger in magnitude than the combined contributions from the oxygen-polarized bonding orbitals: $|\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\text{HOMO}}|  |\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\text{bonds}}|$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. **The relative AO energies, $E(2s_{\\mathrm{O}})  E(2s_{\\mathrm{C}})$ and $E(2p_{\\mathrm{O}})  E(2p_{\\mathrm{C}})$, cause bonding MOs to be polarized toward oxygen and antibonding MOs toward carbon; however, the highest occupied molecular orbital in $\\mathrm{CO}$ is a largely nonbonding $\\sigma$ orbital (often labeled $5\\sigma$) localized on carbon. This localization places slightly more electron density on carbon, so the negative end of the measured dipole lies on carbon despite oxygen’s greater electronegativity.**\nThis statement is a correct, albeit simplified, synopsis of the MO-based explanation. It correctly identifies the polarization of bonding orbitals and the nature and location of the HOMO. It correctly attributes the final dipole direction to the effect of the HOMO localization overcoming the bond polarities expected from electronegativity. **Correct**.\n\nB. **The formal charge assignment $\\mathrm{C^- \\equiv O^+}$ implies a very large dipole moment pointing toward carbon; therefore, the small experimental dipole of about $0.11$ Debye must be an instrument artifact.**\nThis statement commits a gross scientific error. While the premise about the implication of formal charges is reasonable, the conclusion to discard a well-established experimental fact because a simple model fails to predict it quantitatively is unacceptable. The failure lies with the over-simplified model (formal charge), not the experiment. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. **Because oxygen is more electronegative, the highest occupied molecular orbital is localized on oxygen; accordingly, the negative end of the dipole lies on oxygen, contradicting the Lewis structure.**\nThe central premise of this statement is false. Due to s-p mixing, the HOMO of $\\mathrm{CO}$ is the $5\\sigma$ orbital, which is predominantly localized on carbon, not oxygen. Therefore, the entire line of reasoning is flawed. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. **In heteronuclear diatomics like $\\mathrm{CO}$, mixing of $2s$ and $2p$ $\\sigma$ orbitals shifts the carbon-based $\\sigma$ lone pair up in energy and onto carbon, enhancing its donor ability; simultaneously, the $\\pi$ bonding orbitals are polarized toward oxygen. The opposing contributions from the carbon lone pair and the $\\sigma/\\pi$ bond polarizations partially cancel, yielding a small net dipole with carbon slightly negative.**\nThis statement provides a more detailed and physically precise explanation. It correctly identifies s-p mixing as the cause for the HOMO's character and energy. It explicitly states the crucial concept of opposing contributions from the carbon lone pair (HOMO) and the polarized bonding orbitals. It correctly concludes that their partial cancellation results in the observed small net dipole. This is an excellent reconciliation of the data. **Correct**.\n\nE. **Replacing $\\mathrm{CO}$ by $\\mathrm{CO^-}$ would populate a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital with more carbon character, increasing electron density on carbon and increasing the magnitude of the negative end on carbon.**\nThis option tests the predictive validity of the MO model. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of $\\mathrm{CO}$ are the degenerate antibonding $\\pi^*$ orbitals. Consistent with general MO principles, antibonding orbitals are polarized towards the less electronegative atom, which is carbon. Therefore, the $\\pi^*$ LUMO has more carbon character. Adding an electron to form $\\mathrm{CO^-}$ populates this C-rich orbital. This increases the electron density on carbon, which would enhance the magnitude of the dipole moment that already has its negative pole on carbon. The reasoning is sound and consistent. **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADE}$$", "id": "2944043"}]}
