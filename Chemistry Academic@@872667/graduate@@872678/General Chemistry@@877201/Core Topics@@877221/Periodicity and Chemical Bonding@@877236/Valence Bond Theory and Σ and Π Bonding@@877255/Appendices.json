It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information to derive the properties of $sp^{2}$ hybrid orbitals in a trigonal planar geometry. The problem is therefore valid, and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part derivation. We will address each part systematically.\n\nFirst, we must construct the symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALCs) from the abstract bond-direction basis $\\{|u_{1}\\rangle, |u_{2}\\rangle, |u_{3}\\rangle\\}$. This basis spans a reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}$, of the $D_{3h}$ point group. The characters of this representation, $\\chi_{\\sigma}(R)$, are found by counting the number of basis functions left unmoved by each symmetry operation $R$ of the group. The bond directions correspond to angles $\\theta_{1}=0$, $\\theta_{2}=2\\pi/3$, and $\\theta_{3}=4\\pi/3$. The symmetry operations of $D_{3h}$ are $E$, $C_{3}$, $C_{2}$, $\\sigma_{h}$, $S_{3}$, and $\\sigma_{v}$.\nThe characters are:\n$\\chi_{\\sigma}(E) = 3$, as all three vectors are unchanged.\n$\\chi_{\\sigma}(C_{3}) = 0$, as all three vectors are moved to a different position.\n$\\chi_{\\sigma}(C_{2}) = 1$, as one $C_{2}$ axis passes through one bond vector.\n$\\chi_{\\sigma}(\\sigma_{h}) = 3$, as all vectors lie in the horizontal mirror plane.\n$\\chi_{\\sigma}(S_{3}) = 0$, as $S_{3} = \\sigma_{h}C_{3}$, and $C_{3}$ moves all vectors.\n$\\chi_{\\sigma}(\\sigma_{v}) = 1$, as one vertical mirror plane contains one bond vector.\nThus, the character set for $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}$ is $(3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1)$.\n\nUsing the reduction formula, $n_{\\Gamma} = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{R} \\chi_{\\Gamma}(R) \\chi_{\\sigma}(R)$, where $|G|=12$ is the order of the group, we decompose $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}$.\nFor $A_{1}^{\\prime}$ (characters $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$):\n$n_{A_{1}^{\\prime}} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(3) + 2(1)(0) + 3(1)(1) + 1(3) + 2(1)(0) + 3(1)(1)] = \\frac{1}{12} (3+3+3+3) = 1$.\nFor $E^{\\prime}$ (characters $(2, -1, 0, 2, -1, 0)$):\n$n_{E^{\\prime}} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(2)(3) + 2(-1)(0) + 3(0)(1) + 1(2)(3) + 2(-1)(0) + 3(0)(1)] = \\frac{1}{12} (6+6) = 1$.\nThus, $\\Gamma_{\\sigma} = A_{1}^{\\prime} \\oplus E^{\\prime}$. This matches the symmetry of the central-atom valence basis $\\{|s\\rangle, |p_{x}\\rangle, |p_{y}\\rangle\\}$.\n\nTo construct the SALCs, we use the projection operator. For the totally symmetric $A_{1}^{\\prime}$ representation, the SALC is simply the normalized sum of all basis functions:\n$$ \\psi_{A_{1}^{\\prime}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(|u_{1}\\rangle + |u_{2}\\rangle + |u_{3}\\rangle) $$\nassuming the abstract basis $\\{|u_{k}\\rangle\\}$ is orthonormal, $\\langle u_{k}|u_{\\ell} \\rangle = \\delta_{k\\ell}$.\n\nFor the two-dimensional $E^{\\prime}$ representation, the problem specifies that the basis should correspond to in-plane Cartesian behavior. We can construct functions that transform like the $x$ and $y$ coordinates by projecting the basis vectors $\\{|u_{k}\\rangle\\}$ onto the $x$ and $y$ axes, using the cosines and sines of the bond angles $\\theta_{k}$.\nThe SALC that transforms as $x$ is:\n$$ \\psi_{E^{\\prime},x} \\propto \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\cos(\\theta_{k}) |u_{k}\\rangle = \\cos(0)|u_{1}\\rangle + \\cos(2\\pi/3)|u_{2}\\rangle + \\cos(4\\pi/3)|u_{3}\\rangle = |u_{1}\\rangle - \\frac{1}{2}|u_{2}\\rangle - \\frac{1}{2}|u_{3}\\rangle $$\nNormalizing this vector: $N^{2}(1^{2} + (-\\frac{1}{2})^{2} + (-\\frac{1}{2})^{2}) = N^{2}(1 + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{3}{2}N^{2} = 1 \\implies N=\\sqrt{2/3}$.\nThe expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{2}(2|u_1\\rangle - |u_2\\rangle - |u_3\\rangle)$. Normalizing this gives a factor of $1/\\sqrt{6}$. So,\n$$ \\psi_{E^{\\prime},x} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(2|u_{1}\\rangle - |u_{2}\\rangle - |u_{3}\\rangle) $$\nThe SALC that transforms as $y$ is:\n$$ \\psi_{E^{\\prime},y} \\propto \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\sin(\\theta_{k}) |u_{k}\\rangle = \\sin(0)|u_{1}\\rangle + \\sin(2\\pi/3)|u_{2}\\rangle + \\sin(4\\pi/3)|u_{3}\\rangle = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|u_{2}\\rangle - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|u_{3}\\rangle \\propto |u_{2}\\rangle - |u_{3}\\rangle $$\nNormalizing this vector: $N^{2}(1^{2} + (-1)^{2}) = 2N^{2} = 1 \\implies N=1/\\sqrt{2}$. So,\n$$ \\psi_{E^{\\prime},y} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|u_{2}\\rangle - |u_{3}\\rangle) $$\nThese three SALCs, $\\psi_{A_{1}^{\\prime}}$, $\\psi_{E^{\\prime},x}$, and $\\psi_{E^{\\prime},y}$, are mutually orthogonal and form the symmetry-adapted basis. This completes the first part.\n\nSecond, we map the SALCs onto the atomic orbitals. The principle of hybridization requires a one-to-one correspondence between the SALCs of the bond vectors and SALCs of the atomic orbitals. The central atom basis is $\\{|s\\rangle, |p_{x}\\rangle, |p_{y}\\rangle\\}$. We are given that $|s\\rangle$ transforms as $A_{1}^{\\prime}$, and the pair $\\{|p_{x}\\rangle, |p_{y}\\rangle\\}$ transforms as $E^{\\prime}$. Therefore, we make the correspondence:\n$\\psi_{A_{1}^{\\prime}} \\leftrightarrow |s\\rangle$\n$\\psi_{E^{\\prime},x} \\leftrightarrow |p_{x}\\rangle$\n$\\psi_{E^{\\prime},y} \\leftrightarrow |p_{y}\\rangle$\n\nThe transformation from the basis $\\{|u_k\\rangle\\}$ to the SALC basis is unitary. To find the hybrid orbitals $|h_k\\rangle$, we invert the transformation. The relations can be written in matrix form:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\psi_{A_{1}^{\\prime}} \\\\ \\psi_{E^{\\prime},x} \\\\ \\psi_{E^{\\prime},y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{3} & 1/\\sqrt{3} & 1/\\sqrt{3} \\\\ 2/\\sqrt{6} & -1/\\sqrt{6} & -1/\\sqrt{6} \\\\ 0 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} |u_{1}\\rangle \\\\ |u_{2}\\rangle \\\\ |u_{3}\\rangle \\end{pmatrix} $$\nInverting this orthogonal matrix by taking its transpose and substituting the AOs for SALCs and $|h_k\\rangle$ for $|u_k\\rangle$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} |h_{1}\\rangle \\\\ |h_{2}\\rangle \\\\ |h_{3}\\rangle \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{3} & 2/\\sqrt{6} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3} & -1/\\sqrt{6} & 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3} & -1/\\sqrt{6} & -1/\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} |s\\rangle \\\\ |p_{x}\\rangle \\\\ |p_{y}\\rangle \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFrom this, we write out the expression for the general hybrid orbital $|h_{k}\\rangle$:\n$$ |h_{k}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}|s\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(2\\delta_{k1}-\\delta_{k2}-\\delta_{k3})|p_{x}\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\delta_{k2}-\\delta_{k3})|p_{y}\\rangle $$\nLet's verify this matches the form $|h_{k}\\rangle = \\alpha\\,|s\\rangle + \\beta(\\cos\\theta_{k}\\,|p_{x}\\rangle + \\sin\\theta_{k}\\,|p_{y}\\rangle)$.\nFor $k=1$: $\\theta_1=0$, $\\cos\\theta_1=1$, $\\sin\\theta_1=0$.\n$|h_1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}|s\\rangle + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}|p_x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}|s\\rangle + \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}|p_x\\rangle$. This implies $\\alpha = 1/\\sqrt{3}$ and $\\beta = \\sqrt{2/3}$.\nFor $k=2$: $\\theta_2=2\\pi/3$, $\\cos\\theta_2=-1/2$, $\\sin\\theta_2=\\sqrt{3}/2$.\n$|h_2\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}|s\\rangle - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}|p_x\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|p_y\\rangle$.\nUsing the proposed form with $\\alpha=1/\\sqrt{3}, \\beta=\\sqrt{2/3}$:\n$|h_2\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}|s\\rangle + \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}(-\\frac{1}{2}|p_x\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|p_y\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}|s\\rangle - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}|p_x\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|p_y\\rangle$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard, albeit simplified, scenario from physical organic chemistry that can be rigorously analyzed using the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and valence bond theory. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem concerns the electronic structure of ethene twisted by $\\theta = 90^\\circ$. At this geometry, the two $p$ orbitals on the adjacent carbon atoms, which form the $\\pi$ bond in planar ethene, are mutually orthogonal. We are asked to consider a minimal valence-bond (VB) description for the two electrons in these two orbitals, $\\phi_a$ and $\\phi_b$.\n\nAccording to the Heitler-London or valence bond approach for a two-electron, two-orbital system, we can construct two-electron wavefunctions that satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. The total wavefunction is a product of a spatial part and a spin part. For the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric with respect to electron exchange, a symmetric spatial part must be paired with an antisymmetric spin part (singlet state, $S=0$), and an antisymmetric spatial part must be paired with a symmetric spin part (triplet state, $S=1$).\n\nThe symmetric (+) and antisymmetric (-) spatial wavefunctions are:\n$$ \\Psi_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1 \\pm S_{ab}^2)}} \\left[ \\phi_a(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_b(\\mathbf{r}_2) \\pm \\phi_b(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_a(\\mathbf{r}_2) \\right] $$\nwhere $S_{ab} = \\int \\phi_a^*(\\mathbf{r})\\phi_b(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau$ is the overlap integral.\nThe singlet state corresponds to $\\Psi_+$ and has energy $E_S$. The triplet state corresponds to $\\Psi_-$ and has energy $E_T$. The energies are given by:\n$$ E_{S/T} = \\frac{J \\pm K}{1 \\pm S_{ab}^2} $$\nwhere $J$ is the Coulomb integral representing the classical electrostatic repulsion between the electron clouds $\\phi_a^2$ and $\\phi_b^2$, and $K$ is the exchange integral, which has no classical analogue and is responsible for covalent bonding (for $K<0$) and exchange repulsion. The exchange integral $K$ is proportional to the overlap density; a non-zero overlap $S_{ab}$ is required for a non-zero direct exchange integral $K$.\n\nFor the specific case of twisted ethene at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$, the $p$ orbitals $\\phi_a$ and $\\phi_b$ are orthogonal by symmetry. Therefore, their overlap integral is exactly zero:\n$$ S_{ab} = \\int \\phi_a^*(\\mathbf{r})\\phi_b(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau = 0 $$\nSince the direct exchange integral $K$ depends on the orbital overlap, the vanishing of $S_{ab}$ implies that the direct exchange integral is also zero, $K=0$. Substituting $S_{ab}=0$ and $K=0$ into the energy expressions, we find:\n$$ E_S = \\frac{J + 0}{1 + 0} = J $$\n$$ E_T = \\frac{J - 0}{1 - 0} = J $$\nIn this minimal model, the singlet and triplet diradical states are energetically degenerate.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\nA. In a minimal valence-bond model at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ that includes only the two carbon $p$ orbitals and their direct overlap, the lowest singlet and triplet diradical states are exactly degenerate.\nAs derived above from fundamental VB principles, the orthogonality of the $p$ orbitals at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ leads to $S_{ab} = 0$ and consequently the direct exchange integral $K=0$. This results in $E_S = E_T = J$. The statement is therefore a direct and correct consequence of applying the minimal VB model to this situation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. Even at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$, a full $\\pi$ bond persists because rotation does not change the number of electrons; therefore the $\\pi$ bond order remains $1$.\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. A covalent bond, such as a $\\pi$ bond, is not merely the presence of electrons. It is an intricate quantum mechanical effect arising from the constructive interference of atomic orbitals, quantified by the overlap integral $S_{ab}$ and the stabilization provided by the exchange integral $K$. At $\\theta = 90^\\circ$, the orbital overlap $S_{ab}$ is zero, which means there is no constructive interference and no bonding interaction. The $\\pi$ bond is completely broken. The $\\pi$ bond order is $0$. While the number of electrons is conserved, their energetic configuration changes drastically upon bond breaking.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. The two unpaired electrons can be localized in orthogonal $p$ orbitals on different carbons with vanishing direct overlap integral $S_{ab} = 0$ by symmetry, yielding a diradical with negligible direct exchange.\nThis statement accurately describes the physical and mathematical premises of the minimal model for the $90^\\circ$-twisted ethene diradical. The geometry dictates that the two relevant $p$ orbitals are orthogonal, making their overlap integral $S_{ab}$ zero by symmetry. The consequence of zero overlap is the quenching of the direct exchange interaction ($K=0$) which is responsible for covalent bonding and singlet-triplet splitting in the simple Heitler-London model. The term \"diradical\" is appropriate for a system with two unpaired electrons in non-bonding, spatially distinct orbitals.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nD. Coupling of the $p$-orbital spins mediated through the carbon–carbon $\\sigma$ framework generates an effective exchange interaction $J$ that lifts the singlet–triplet degeneracy; depending on the sign of $J$, either the singlet ($J>0$) or triplet ($J<0$) is stabilized.\nThis statement describes a higher-order effect that is absent in the \"minimal\" model but is physically present in the actual molecule. The minimal model only considers direct exchange between $\\phi_a$ and $\\phi_b$. However, the electrons in these $p$ orbitals can interact indirectly via their exchange interactions with the electrons in the intervening C-C $\\sigma$ bond. This mechanism is known as indirect exchange or superexchange. This generates a small but non-zero *effective* exchange coupling, usually denoted $J_{eff}$. This effective coupling lifts the exact degeneracy predicted by the simple model. The statement correctly identifies the mechanism (mediation through the $\\sigma$ framework) and the consequence (lifting the singlet-triplet degeneracy). The notation relating the sign of the coupling constant ($J$ in the statement, meaning $J_{eff}$) to which state is stabilized is a matter of convention, but the physical principle described is sound. This is a correct statement about the physics of the system, refining the picture from the minimal model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nE. At $\\theta = 90^\\circ$, a spin-restricted closed-shell molecular orbital description with doubly occupied $\\pi$ and $\\pi^*$ orbitals remains qualitatively valid and lower in energy than any broken-symmetry or valence-bond description.\nThis statement is incorrect. In molecular orbital (MO) theory, the $\\pi$ bonding and $\\pi^*$ antibonding orbitals become degenerate when the resonance integral $\\beta$, which depends on overlap, goes to zero at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$. A spin-restricted, closed-shell description (like RHF) would force both electrons into one of these degenerate non-bonding orbitals. This describes a purely ionic state (e.g., C$^+$-C$^-$) which has very high energy due to electron-electron repulsion and is a qualitatively incorrect description of the covalent diradical state. This is a classic example of static correlation, where single-reference closed-shell methods fail catastrophically. Multi-reference methods or broken-symmetry methods (like VB theory) are required for a qualitatively correct description and give a much lower energy. The phrase \"doubly occupied $\\pi$ and $\\pi^*$ orbitals\" is also nonsensical for a two-electron system.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nF. The Pauli exclusion principle forbids the triplet diradical at $\\theta = 90^\\circ$ because the spatial orbitals are orthogonal and therefore the spins must be antiparallel.\nThis statement fundamentally misinterprets the Pauli exclusion principle. The principle requires the total wavefunction (spatial $\\times$ spin) to be antisymmetric. A triplet state has a symmetric spin function, and therefore requires an *antisymmetric* spatial function to satisfy the Pauli principle. The antisymmetric spatial function is $\\Psi_- = N[\\phi_a(1)\\phi_b(2) - \\phi_b(1)\\phi_a(2)]$. This function is perfectly valid and non-zero when the electrons occupy different spatial orbitals, such as $\\phi_a$ and $\\phi_b$, regardless of whether these orbitals are orthogonal or not. The condition that spins must be antiparallel (singlet) applies only when two electrons occupy the *same* spatial orbital, which is not the case here. The triplet state is perfectly allowed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2963120"}]}
