{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly grasp the concept of effective nuclear charge, we must first dismantle the overly simplistic, classical picture of electrons orbiting the nucleus in rigid, separate shells. This introductory exercise challenges such a model by presenting a common and intuitive, yet incorrect, argument about shielding in the potassium atom. By identifying the fundamental flaw in this reasoning, you will build a more accurate quantum mechanical intuition based on the probabilistic nature of electron orbitals and the crucial concept of orbital penetration [@problem_id:1990873].", "problem": "An undergraduate chemistry student is studying the concept of effective nuclear charge ($Z_{eff}$) using the potassium atom (K, atomic number $Z = 19$) as a model. The ground-state electron configuration of potassium is $[Ar] 4s^1$. The student puts forward the following argument:\n\n\"The single valence electron is in the $4s$ orbital. The remaining 18 electrons, which constitute the argon-like core ($1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6$), are all in shells closer to the nucleus than the $n=4$ shell. Therefore, these 18 core electrons should act as a perfect, complete shield. The shielding constant, $S$, should be exactly 18. Consequently, the effective nuclear charge experienced by the $4s$ electron should be $Z_{eff} = Z - S = 19 - 18 = +1$.\"\n\nWhile simple, this model is known to be incorrect, as the experimentally determined first ionization energy of potassium suggests a $Z_{eff}$ value significantly greater than +1. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and primary explanation for the flaw in the student's reasoning?\n\nA. The student's model neglects the electron-electron repulsion between the core electrons themselves, which causes the core to expand and become a less effective shield.\n\nB. The student's model incorrectly assumes electrons are in rigid, non-overlapping shells. In reality, the radial probability distribution of the $4s$ orbital allows it to penetrate the inner electron shells, causing it to be incompletely shielded.\n\nC. For atoms with more than 18 electrons, relativistic effects become significant, causing the $1s$ orbital to contract. This contraction pulls the other orbitals closer to the nucleus, universally increasing the effective nuclear charge on the valence electron.\n\nD. The shielding effect is not linear. Each additional core electron provides progressively less shielding, so the total shielding constant $S$ is always less than half the number of core electrons.\n\nE. The student's model is fundamentally inverted; core electrons do not shield the nuclear charge but rather focus it. This effect, known as nuclear lensing, means the effective charge is always greater than the true nuclear charge $Z$.", "solution": "Define the effective nuclear charge by the mean-field relation\n$$\nZ_{\\text{eff}}=Z-S,\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the shielding constant summarizing how much of the nuclear charge is screened by other electrons on average.\n\nThe student’s argument sets $S=18$ by assuming a perfect, complete shield from the $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{6}$ core. This rests on an implicit classical picture of rigid, non-overlapping shells: the $4s$ electron is presumed to reside entirely outside the core, so it would always experience the full negative charge of all $18$ core electrons between it and the nucleus.\n\nQuantum mechanically, this picture is incorrect because electrons occupy orbitals with radial probability distributions, not fixed shells. The radial probability density for an $ns$ orbital is\n$$\nP_{ns}(r)=r^{2}\\,|R_{ns}(r)|^{2},\n$$\nand for $s$ states ($l=0$), $R_{ns}(r)$ is finite at $r=0$ and has significant amplitude at small $r$. Thus, the $4s$ electron penetrates into regions of space where core electrons are also present. Whenever the $4s$ electron is found at a radius $r$ inside some portion of the core electron density, only the core charge at radii less than $r$ can screen the nucleus at that instant; electron density at radii larger than $r$ does not shield. Consequently, the instantaneous shielding is less than complete whenever penetration occurs, and the average shielding $S$ over the $4s$ radial distribution satisfies $S18$, leading to $Z_{\\text{eff}}1$.\n\nThis penetration effect is precisely what is captured by empirical rules such as Slater’s rules, which assign less-than-complete screening contributions to electrons in shells with $n-1$ relative to the valence $ns$ electron. The root cause is the non-rigid, overlapping, radially penetrating nature of the $4s$ orbital, not core-core repulsion or relativistic contraction.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is not the primary flaw; core-core repulsion and any consequent expansion are secondary, and even a non-expanded core would not perfectly shield an $s$ electron due to penetration.\n- Option C invokes relativistic effects that are not dominant for $Z$ of this magnitude and does not address the main quantum-mechanical cause of incomplete shielding.\n- Option D asserts an incorrect universal quantitative rule; while shielding is not simply additive, the primary reason here is penetration, not a blanket “less than half” rule.\n- Option E is physically incorrect; core electrons do not focus the nuclear charge to exceed $Z$.\n\nThe most accurate and primary explanation is that the student incorrectly assumed rigid, non-overlapping shells; the $4s$ electron penetrates the core and is incompletely shielded.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1990873"}, {"introduction": "Having established the qualitative reason for incomplete shielding, we now move to a quantitative estimation using a time-tested empirical model.

For such an electron, Slater's rules are:\n1. Electrons in groups with a principal quantum number greater than the target electron's ($n'  n$) contribute $0$ to $S$.\n2. Other electrons in the same $(ns, np)$ group contribute $0.35$ each to $S$.\n3. Electrons in the shell with principal quantum number $n-1$ contribute $0.85$ each to $S$.\n4. Electrons in shells with principal quantum number $n-2$ or less contribute $1.00$ each to $S$.\n\nWe now apply these rules to a target $4p$ electron in selenium:\n- The $(4s, 4p)$ group contains $2+4=6$ electrons. The other $5$ electrons in this group screen the target electron. Their contribution to $S$ is $5 \\times 0.35 = 1.75$.\n- The $n-1 = 3$ shell consists of the $(3s, 3p)$ group and the $(3d)$ group, containing a total of $8+10=18$ electrons. Their contribution to $S$ is $18 \\times 0.85 = 15.3$.\n- The $n-2 = 2$ and lower shells consist of the $(2s, 2p)$ group and the $(1s)$ group, containing a total of $8+2=10$ electrons.

For such an electron, the rules are different:\n1. Other electrons in the same $(nd)$ group contribute $0.35$ each to $S$.\n2. All electrons in groups to the left of the $(nd)$ group (i.e., with smaller principal quantum numbers, or in $s,p$ subshells of the same principal quantum number) contribute $1.00$ each to $S$.\n3.

The other $9$ electrons in this group screen the target electron. Their contribution to $S$ is $9 \\times 0.35 = 3.15$.\n- All electrons in groups to the left—the $(1s^2)$, $(2s, 2p)^8$, and $(3s, 3p)^8$ groups—contribute. This is a total of $2+8+8=18$ electrons. Their contribution to $S$ is $18 \\times 1.00 = 18.0$.\n- Electrons in the $(4s, 4p)$ group have a higher principal quantum number ($n=4$) and thus contribute $0$ to the screening of a $3d$ electron.\n\nThe total screening constant for a $3d$ electron, $S(3d)$, is the sum of these contributions:\n$$ S(3d) = (9 \\times 0.35) + (18 \\times 1.00) = 3.15 + 18.0 = 21.15 $$\nThe effective nuclear charge is therefore:\n$$ Z_{\\text{eff}}(3d) = Z - S(3d) = 34 - 21.15 = 12.85 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the required difference, $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = Z_{\\text{eff}}(4p) - Z_{\\text{eff}}(3d) = 6.95 - 12.85 = -5.9 $$\nThis result indicates that, according to Slater's model, a $3d$ electron in selenium experiences a significantly higher effective nuclear charge than a $4p$ electron. This is because valence electrons (like a $4p$ electron) are heavily shielded by all core electrons, whereas inner-shell electrons (like a $3d$ electron) are shielded less effectively, primarily only by electrons in shells closer to the nucleus. Furthermore, the rules for $d$-electrons stipulate that even electrons in the same principal shell ($3s, 3p$) offer full screening ($1.00$), a key difference from the rules for $s,p$-electrons.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-5.9} $$", "id": "2934518"}, {"introduction": "While empirical rules are useful, a graduate-level understanding requires connecting concepts back to fundamental theory.
