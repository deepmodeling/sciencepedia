When these two elements react to form a stable binary compound, what is the primary type of chemical bond expected to form between them?\n\nA. Ionic bond\n\nB. Polar covalent bond\n\nC. Nonpolar covalent bond\n\nD. Metallic bond\n\nE. Hydrogen bond", "solution": "The quantum number $l=0$ denotes an $s$ subshell. For Element X, having two valence electrons with $n=4$ and $l=0$ means both valence electrons occupy the $4s$ subshell, giving a valence configuration $4s^{2}$. Elements with $ns^{2}$ valence configurations are group 2 metals (alkaline earth metals). Such elements have low ionization energies for removing two electrons and characteristically form $X^{2+}$ cations to attain a noble-gas-like configuration.\n\nElement Y is described as having six valence electrons all in the $n=3$ principal level. The only way to place six electrons in the $n=3$ valence shell is the configuration $3s^{2}3p^{4}$, which corresponds to a group 16 nonmetal (a chalcogen). Such elements tend to gain two electrons to complete an octet, forming $Y^{2-}$ anions.\n\nWhen Element X (a group 2 metal) reacts with Element Y (a group 16 nonmetal), two electrons are transferred from X to Y:\n$$X \\rightarrow X^{2+} + 2e^{-}, \\qquad Y + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow Y^{2-}.$$\nThe resulting oppositely charged ions $X^{2+}$ and $Y^{2-}$ experience strong electrostatic attraction, with potential energy described qualitatively by Coulomb’s law $U(r)=-k_{e}\\frac{|q_{1}q_{2}|}{r}$, characteristic of ionic bonding. Therefore, the primary bond in the stable binary compound $XY$ is ionic.\n\nThis excludes metallic bonding (requires metal-metal), hydrogen bonding (requires hydrogen), and covalent bonding (both polar and nonpolar), since the large electronegativity difference between a group 2 metal and a group 16 nonmetal favors full electron transfer rather than sharing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2026775"}, {"introduction": "While Lewis structures provide a powerful framework for visualizing covalent bonds, a single diagram is often insufficient for molecules with delocalized electrons.
