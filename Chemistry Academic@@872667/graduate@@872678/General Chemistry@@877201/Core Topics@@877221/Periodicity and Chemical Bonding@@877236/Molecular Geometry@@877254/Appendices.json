The model of an ideal octahedron is a standard and appropriate simplification. The definitions provided for \"geometrical isomer\" and \"optical activity\" are clear and mathematically precise, even if the former is a non-standard simplification that equates stereoisomers with geometrical isomers. For the specific case of $M(L)_4X_2$, it will be shown that no chiral isomers exist, so the number of stereoisomers equals the number of geometrical isomers, rendering the definition's non-standard nature moot for the final count. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe problem requires us to find the number of distinct ways to arrange $4$ ligands of type $L$ and $2$ ligands of type $X$ on the vertices of an octahedron. This is a problem of counting the number of orbits of a set of colorings under a group action. The problem specifies that the group to be used is the proper rotation subgroup of $O_h$, which is the chiral octahedral group $O$. The order of group $O$ is $|O| = 24$.\n\nThe number of orbits, $N$, is given by the Orbit-Counting Theorem (often referred to as Burnside's Lemma):\n$$N = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} |\\text{fix}(g)|$$\nHere, $G = O$, and $\\text{fix}(g)$ is the set of colorings that are left unchanged by the action of the group element $g$. A coloring is specified by placing $2$ $X$ ligands and $4$ $L$ ligands on the $6$ vertices. A coloring is fixed by $g$ if and only if all vertices within any cycle of the permutation induced by $g$ are of the same color.\n\nThe group $O$ has $5$ conjugacy classes. We will analyze the permutations they induce on the $6$ vertices and find the number of fixed colorings for each class.\n\n1.  **Identity ($E$)**: There is $1$ element. The permutation consists of $6$ cycles of length $1$: $(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)$. To place $2$ $X$ ligands, we can choose any $2$ of the $6$ vertices. The number of ways is $|\\text{fix}(E)| = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15$.\n\n2.  **Rotations by $\\pm 120^\\circ$ ($C_3$)**: There are $8$ such elements, with axes passing through the centers of opposite triangular faces. The permutation of vertices for any $C_3$ consists of $2$ cycles of length $3$: e.g., $(123)(456)$. To place $2$ $X$ ligands, we would need to color a cycle of $3$ vertices with two $X$'s, which is impossible as all vertices in a cycle must have the same color. Thus, $|\\text{fix}(C_3)| = 0$.\n\n3.  **Rotations by $\\pm 90^\\circ$ ($C_4$)**: There are $6$ such elements, with axes passing through opposite vertices. The permutation of vertices for any $C_4$ consists of $1$ cycle of length $4$ and $2$ cycles of length $1$ (the vertices on the rotation axis): e.g., $(1234)(5)(6)$. To place $2$ $X$ ligands, their positions must be invariant. This is only possible if the $X$ ligands occupy the $2$ fixed points (the vertices in the length-1 cycles). There is only $\\binom{2}{2}=1$ way to do this. Thus, $|\\text{fix}(C_4)| = 1$.\n\n4.  **Rotations by $180^\\circ$ whose axes pass through opposite vertices ($C_2 = C_4^2$)**: There are $3$ such elements. The permutation consists of $2$ cycles of length $2$ and $2$ cycles of length $1$: e.g., $(12)(34)(5)(6)$. To place $2$ $X$ ligands, the positions can be:\n    -   The $2$ fixed points (length-1 cycles): $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ way.\n    -   One of the two length-2 cycles: $\\binom{2}{1} = 2$ ways.\n    The total number of ways is $1 + 2 = 3$. Thus, $|\\text{fix}(C_2)| = 3$.\n\n5.  **Rotations by $180^\\circ$ whose axes pass through midpoints of opposite edges ($C_2'$)**: There are $6$ such elements. The permutation consists of $3$ cycles of length $2$: e.g., $(12)(34)(56)$. To place $2$ $X$ ligands, they must occupy one of the three length-2 cycles. There are $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to choose which cycle. Thus, $|\\text{fix}(C_2')| = 3$.\n\nNow, we apply the Orbit-Counting Theorem:\n$$N = \\frac{1}{24} \\left[ 1 \\cdot |\\text{fix}(E)| + 8 \\cdot |\\text{fix}(C_3)| + 6 \\cdot |\\text{fix}(C_4)| + 3 \\cdot |\\text{fix}(C_2)| + 6 \\cdot |\\text{fix}(C_2')| \\right]$$\n$$N = \\frac{1}{24} \\left[ 1 \\cdot 15 + 8 \\cdot 0 + 6 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 3 + 6 \\cdot 3 \\right]$$\n$$N = \\frac{1}{24} \\left[ 15 + 0 + 6 + 9 + 18 \\right]$$\n$$N = \\frac{1}{24} [48] = 2$$\nThere are exactly $2$ geometrical isomers. These correspond to the relative positioning of the two $X$ ligands:\n-   **trans-isomer**: The two $X$ ligands are at opposite vertices (positions $1, 6$).\n-   **cis-isomer**: The two $X$ ligands are at adjacent vertices (positions $1, 2$).\n\nNext, we determine the point group and optical activity of each isomer.\n\n**Trans-isomer ($M(L)_4X_2$)**\nThe two $X$ ligands are positioned at opposite vertices, defining a principal axis. Let this be the z-axis. The four $L$ ligands form a square in the xy-plane.\n-   Symmetry elements include:\n    -   A $C_4$ axis along the $X-M-X$ bond.\n    -   Four $C_2$ axes perpendicular to the $C_4$ axis.\n    -   An inversion center, $i$.\n    -   A horizontal mirror plane, $\\sigma_h$, in the plane of the $L$ ligands.\n    -   Vertical and dihedral mirror planes ($\\sigma_v, \\sigma_d$).\nThe full set of these symmetry elements corresponds to the point group $D_{4h}$.\nA molecule is optically active if its point group contains no improper rotation axis ($S_n$). The $D_{4h}$ group contains an inversion center $i$ (which is an $S_2$ axis) and mirror planes $\\sigma$ (which are $S_1$ axes). Therefore, the trans-isomer is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Cis-isomer ($M(L)_4X_2$)**\nThe two $X$ ligands are at adjacent vertices. Let the positions be $(0,0,a)$ and $(a,0,0)$.\n-   Symmetry elements include:\n    -   A $C_2$ axis that bisects the $X-M-X$ angle.\n    -   A mirror plane ($\\sigma_v$) that contains both $X$ ligands and the two $L$ ligands that are trans to them.\n    -   A second mirror plane ($\\sigma_v'$) that is perpendicular to the first and bisects the $X-M-X$ bond.\nThe set of elements $\\{E, C_2, \\sigma_v, \\sigma_v'\\}$ defines the point group $C_{2v}$.\nThe $C_{2v}$ group contains mirror planes ($\\sigma_v$). Since a mirror plane is an $S_1$ operation, the molecule is achiral. Therefore, the cis-isomer is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **There are exactly $2$ geometrical isomers.

The first derivative of $E_{\\min}(x;\\beta)$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d E_{\\min}}{d x} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ A(x^4 - 2x_0^2 x^2 + x_0^4) + \\Delta x - \\frac{s_0 \\beta}{2}(1 + \\tanh(\\gamma x)) \\right]\n$$\nUsing standard rules of differentiation and noting that $\\frac{d}{du}(\\tanh u) = \\text{sech}^2(u)$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{d E_{\\min}}{d x} = 4Ax(x^2 - x_0^2) + \\Delta - \\frac{s_0 \\beta \\gamma}{2} \\text{sech}^2(\\gamma x)\n$$\nThe roots of this equation give the coordinates of the stationary points.\n\nNext, we must classify these stationary points by examining the sign of the second derivative, $\\frac{d^2 E_{\\min}}{d x^2}$. A negative sign indicates a local maximum (a valid candidate for the TS), while a positive sign indicates a local minimum.\nThe second derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 E_{\\min}}{d x^2} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ 4A(x^3 - x_0^2 x) + \\Delta - \\frac{s_0 \\beta \\gamma}{2} \\text{sech}^2(\\gamma x) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{d}{du}(\\text{sech}^2 u) = -2\\text{sech}^2 u \\tanh u$, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 E_{\\min}}{d x^2} = 4A(3x^2 - x_0^2) - \\frac{s_0 \\beta \\gamma}{2} \\left(-2\\gamma \\text{sech}^2(\\gamma x) \\tanh(\\gamma x)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 E_{\\min}}{d x^2} = 4A(3x^2 - x_0^2) + s_0 \\beta \\gamma^2 \\text{sech}^2(\\gamma x) \\tanh(\\gamma x)\n$$\nDue to the transcendental term $\\text{sech}^2(\\gamma x)$, the equation $\\frac{d E_{\\min}}{d x} = 0$ does not admit a closed-form analytical solution. Therefore, a numerical approach is mandatory.\n\nThe numerical procedure is as follows:\n1.  For each value of the parameter $\\beta$, define the functions for $E_{\\min}$, its first derivative, and its second derivative using the given constants.\n2.  Scan the specified domain $x \\in [-2.0, 2.0]$ to identify all intervals where the first derivative, $\\frac{d E_{\\min}}{d x}$, changes sign. This indicates the presence of a root.\n3.  Within each such interval, employ a robust numerical root-finding algorithm, such as Brent's method, to compute the stationary point coordinate with high precision.\n4.  For each stationary point found, evaluate the second derivative. Collect all points for which the second derivative is negative.\n5.  If this set of candidate transition states is not empty, evaluate $E_{\\min}$ for each candidate. The coordinate $x^\\star(\\beta)$ is the one corresponding to the highest energy value among them, as stipulated.\n6.  If no stationary points with negative curvature are found, $x^\\star(\\beta)$ is determined by finding the global maximum of $E_{\\min}(x;\\beta)$ on the interval $x \\in [-2.0, 2.0]$. This is equivalent to numerically minimizing $-E_{\\min}(x;\\beta)$ over the bounded interval.\n\nOnce $x^\\star(\\beta)$ is determined, the transition state angle, $\\theta_{\\text{TS}}(\\beta)$, and the change in angle, $\\Delta\\theta(\\beta)$, are calculated directly from their definitions. The constant $\\delta_{\\max}=40^\\circ$ must be converted to radians for calculation.\n\nThe angle $\\theta_{\\text{TS}}(\\beta)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\text{TS}}(\\beta) = \\theta_{\\text{pref}}(\\beta, x^\\star(\\beta)) = \\pi - \\delta_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + \\tanh(\\gamma x^\\star(\\beta))}{2} \\right)\n$$\nThe change in angle $\\Delta\\theta(\\beta)$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\theta(\\beta) = \\theta_{\\text{TS}}(\\beta) - \\pi = - \\delta_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + \\tanh(\\gamma x^\\star(\\beta))}{2} \\right)\n$$\nThe final results for the angles must be converted from radians back to degrees and rounded to the specified precision. This systematic procedure guarantees a unique and correct solution for each test case.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import optimize\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the migratory insertion model problem by finding the transition state\n    for different backbonding strengths.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define constants from the problem statement\n    A = 10.0\n    x0 = 1.0\n    Delta = 0.2\n    gamma = 2.0\n    s0 = 0.5\n    k_theta = 1.0  # Not needed for x_star calculation\n    delta_max_deg = 40.0\n    delta_max_rad = np.deg2rad(delta_max_deg)\n\n    # Test cases for beta\n    test_cases = [0.0, 0.3, 0.8, 1.5]\n\n    # Search domain for x\n    x_domain = [-2.0, 2.0]\n\n    # Store formatted results\n    final_output_list = []\n\n    # Define the component functions of the model\n    def V_mig(x):\n        return A * (x**2 - x0**2)**2 + Delta * x\n\n    def h_func(x):\n        return 0.5 * (1 + np.tanh(gamma * x))\n\n    def S_func(beta):\n        return s0 * beta\n\n    # Define the effective 1D potential energy and its derivatives\n    def E_min(x, beta):\n        return V_mig(x) - S_func(beta) * h_func(x)\n\n    def dE_min_dx(x, beta):\n        sech_sq_term = (1.0 / np.cosh(gamma * x))**2\n        return 4 * A * x * (x**2 - x0**2) + Delta - (S_func(beta) * gamma / 2.0) * sech_sq_term\n\n    def d2E_min_dx2(x, beta):\n        tanh_term = np.tanh(gamma * x)\n        sech_sq_term = (1.0 / np.cosh(gamma * x))**2\n        return 4 * A * (3 * x**2 - x0**2) + S_func(beta) * gamma**2 * sech_sq_term * tanh_term\n\n    for beta in test_cases:\n        # --- Find stationary points ---\n        stationary_points = []\n        # Create a fine grid to find intervals where the derivative changes sign\n        x_grid = np.linspace(x_domain[0], x_domain[1], 2001)\n        y_grid = dE_min_dx(x_grid, beta)\n\n        for i in range(len(x_grid) - 1):\n            if np.sign(y_grid[i]) != np.sign(y_grid[i+1]):\n                try:\n                    root_res = optimize.root_scalar(\n                        lambda x: dE_min_dx(x, beta),\n                        bracket=(x_grid[i], x_grid[i+1]),\n                        method='brentq'\n                    )\n                    if root_res.converged:\n                        stationary_points.append(root_res.root)\n                except ValueError:\n                    # Bracket may not be valid if derivative is zero at an endpoint\n                    pass\n\n        # Remove duplicates that may arise from grid sampling\n        stationary_points = sorted(list(set(stationary_points)))\n\n\n        # --- Classify and select transition state ---\n        ts_candidates = []\n        for sp in stationary_points:\n            curvature = d2E_min_dx2(sp, beta)\n            if curvature  0:\n                ts_candidates.append(sp)\n\n        if ts_candidates:\n            # If local maxima exist, find the one with the highest energy\n            energies = [E_min(sp, beta) for sp in ts_candidates]\n            highest_energy_idx = np.argmax(energies)\n            x_star = ts_candidates[highest_energy_idx]\n        else:\n            # If no local maxima found, find the global maximum in the domain\n            # by minimizing the negative of the energy function.\n            res = optimize.minimize_scalar(\n                lambda x: -E_min(x, beta),\n                bounds=tuple(x_domain),\n                method='bounded'\n            )\n            x_star = res.x\n\n        # --- Calculate observables ---\n        sigma_beta = beta / (1.0 + beta)\n        h_x_star = h_func(x_star)\n        \n        # Calculate Delta_theta in radians, then convert to degrees\n        delta_theta_rad = -delta_max_rad * sigma_beta * h_x_star\n        delta_theta_deg = np.rad2deg(delta_theta_rad)\n\n        # Calculate theta_TS in degrees\n        theta_ts_deg = 180.0 + delta_theta_deg\n        \n        # --- Format and append results ---\n        final_output_list.append(f\"{x_star:.5f}\")\n        final_output_list.append(f\"{theta_ts_deg:.3f}\")\n        final_output_list.append(f\"{delta_theta_deg:.3f}\")\n\n    # Print the final flat list in the required format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(final_output_list)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2947018"}]}
