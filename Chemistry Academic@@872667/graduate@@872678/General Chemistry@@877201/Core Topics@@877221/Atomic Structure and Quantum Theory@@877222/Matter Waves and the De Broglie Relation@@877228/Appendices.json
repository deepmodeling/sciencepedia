For a circular orbit of radius $r$, this translates to a condition of constructive self-interference. The total path length of one orbit, which is the circumference $2\\pi r$, must accommodate an integer number, $N$, of complete wavelengths. Mathematically, this condition is:\n$$\n2\\pi r = N\\lambda\n$$\nwhere $N$ must be a positive integer ($N = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).
