The solution must be derived from first principles, validated by an independent method, and concluded with a calculation of the total number of microstates.\n\nFor two equivalent electrons, the principal quantum numbers are identical, $n_1 = n_2$, and the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are identical, $l_1 = l_2 = 1$. The total wavefunction, $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$, must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of the two electrons, as dictated by the Pauli exclusion principle. In the LS coupling scheme, the total wavefunction can be approximated as a product of a spatial part and a spin part: $\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = \\psi_{\\text{spatial}} \\times \\chi_{\\text{spin}}$. For $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$ to be antisymmetric, one of the factors must be symmetric and the other antisymmetric with respect to particle exchange.\n\nFirst, let us determine the possible values for the total orbital angular momentum, $L$, and total spin, $S$.\nFor two electrons, each with spin $s = \\frac{1}{2}$, the total spin quantum number $S$ is given by the addition of their angular momenta: $S$ can take values from $|s_1 - s_2|$ to $s_1 + s_2$ in integer steps.\n$$\nS \\in \\left\\{ \\left|\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right|, \\dots, \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\} = \\{0, 1\\}\n$$\nThe spin state with $S=1$ is a triplet, which is symmetric under electron exchange. The spin state with $S=0$ is a singlet, which is antisymmetric under electron exchange.\n\nFor two $p$-electrons, each with orbital angular momentum $l=1$, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$ is given by:\n$$\nL \\in \\{ |1-1|, \\dots, 1+1 \\} = \\{0, 1, 2\\}\n$$\nThese correspond to $S$, $P$, and $D$ terms, respectively.\n\nThe symmetry of the spatial part of the wavefunction, $\\psi_{\\text{spatial}}$, for two equivalent electrons with individual orbital angular momentum $l$ coupled to a total $L$, is given by the factor $(-1)^{L}$.\n- For $L=0$ (S term), the spatial part is symmetric ($(-1)^0 = 1$).\n- For $L=1$ (P term), the spatial part is antisymmetric ($(-1)^1 = -1$).\n- For $L=2$ (D term), the spatial part is symmetric ($(-1)^2 = 1$).\n\nWe now combine the spatial and spin parts to form a total wavefunction that is antisymmetric:\n1.  **Symmetric $\\psi_{\\text{spatial}}$ and Antisymmetric $\\chi_{\\text{spin}}$**:\n    -   Symmetric spatial wavefunctions correspond to $L=0$ and $L=2$.\n    -   The antisymmetric spin wavefunction corresponds to the singlet state, $S=0$.\n    -   This combination yields the terms where $(L, S) = (0, 0)$ and $(L, S) = (2, 0)$. In spectroscopic notation, these are the $^1S$ and $^1D$ terms.\n\n2.  **Antisymmetric $\\psi_{\\text{spatial}}$ and Symmetric $\\chi_{\\text{spin}}$**:\n    -   The antisymmetric spatial wavefunction corresponds to $L=1$.\n    -   The symmetric spin wavefunction corresponds to the triplet state, $S=1$.\n    -   This combination yields the term where $(L, S) = (1, 1)$. This is the $^3P$ term.\n\nTherefore, the allowed LS terms for the $p^2$ configuration are $^1S$, $^1D$, and $^3P$.\n\nTo validate this result, we perform an enumeration of all possible microstates. For a $p$ subshell ($l=1$), there are $2l+1 = 3$ spatial orbitals ($m_l = -1, 0, 1$). Including spin ($m_s = \\pm\\frac{1}{2}$), there are $2(2l+1)=6$ available spin-orbitals. The total number of ways to place two indistinguishable electrons into these $6$ spin-orbitals, without two electrons occupying the same spin-orbital, is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\n\\text{Total microstates} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n$$\nEach microstate is characterized by the total projection of orbital angular momentum, $M_L = \\sum m_{li}$, and the total projection of spin angular momentum, $M_S = \\sum m_{si}$. By enumerating all $15$ distinct microstates, we can construct a table of counts for each $(M_L, M_S)$ pair:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n\\hline\nM_L \\setminus M_S  -1  0  1 \\\\\n\\hline\n2  0  1  0 \\\\\n1  1  2  1 \\\\\n0  1  3  1 \\\\\n-1  1  2  1 \\\\\n-2  0  1  0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe now decompose this table to identify the LS terms:\n-   The highest value of $M_L$ is $2$. It appears only with $M_S=0$. This indicates the presence of a term with $L=2$ and $S=0$, which is a $^1D$ term. A $^1D$ term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (5)(1) = 5$ microstates, one for each $M_L \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$ at $M_S=0$. Subtracting these $5$ states leaves the following table:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n\\hline\nM_L \\setminus M_S  -1  0  1 \\\\\n\\hline\n1  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  1  2  1 \\\\\n-1  1  1  1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n(All other rows are zero).\n-   In the remaining table, the highest $M_L$ is $1$. It appears with $M_S \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. This rectangular block of states indicates a term with $L=1$ and $S=1$, which is a $^3P$ term. A $^3P$ term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (3)(3) = 9$ microstates, corresponding to all combinations of $M_L \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and $M_S \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Subtracting one count from each of these $9$ cells gives:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n\\hline\nM_L \\setminus M_S  -1  0  1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0  0  1  0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n(All other rows are zero).\n-   The only remaining microstate is $(M_L, M_S) = (0, 0)$. This corresponds to a term with $L=0$ and $S=0$, which is a $^1S$ term. This term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (1)(1) = 1$ microstate.\n\nThe microstate enumeration confirms that the allowed terms are indeed $^1S$, $^1D$, and $^3P$.\n\nFinally, we compute the total number of microstates accounted for by these allowed LS terms. This is the sum of their degeneracies:\n-   Degeneracy of $^1S$ ($L=0, S=0$): $(2 \\cdot 0 + 1)(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n-   Degeneracy of $^3P$ ($L=1, S=1$): $(2 \\cdot 1 + 1)(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n-   Degeneracy of $^1D$ ($L=2, S=0$): $(2 \\cdot 2 + 1)(2 \\cdot 0 + 1) = 5 \\times 1 = 5$.\n\nThe total number of microstates is the sum of these degeneracies:\n$$\n\\text{Total Microstates} = 1 + 9 + 5 = 15\n$$\nThis sum correctly matches the total number of microstates calculated from the combinatorial formula $\\binom{6}{2}=15$.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe determination of the lowest-energy (ground) term symbol follows a set of rules established by Friedrich Hund, which are a direct consequence of the quantum mechanical treatment of electron-electron repulsion and spin-orbit interaction within the $LS$ coupling approximation.\n\nA $p$-subshell has an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$. The possible magnetic orbital quantum numbers are $m_l \\in \\{-1, 0, +1\\}$. Each orbital can hold two electrons with opposite spin, $m_s = \\pm 1/2$. The total capacity of a $p$-subshell is $2(2l+1) = 6$ electrons.\n\nWe apply Hund's rules sequentially for each configuration $p^n$.\n1.  **Hund's First Rule (Maximization of Spin Multiplicity):** The term with the maximum possible value of total spin $S$ has the lowest energy. This is achieved by placing electrons into different orbitals with parallel spins for as long as the Pauli exclusion principle permits.\n2.  **Hund's Second Rule (Maximization of Total Orbital Angular Momentum):** For a given value of $S$, the term with the maximum possible value of total orbital angular momentum $L$ has the lowest energy. This is achieved by filling orbitals with the highest $m_l$ values first.\n3.  **Hund's Third Rule (Determination of Total Angular Momentum):** For a given term (fixed $S$ and $L$), the energy ordering of the levels, characterized by the total angular momentum quantum number $J$, depends on the subshell filling. $J$ takes values from $|L-S|$ to $L+S$ in integer steps.\n    - For a subshell that is less than half-filled ($n  2l+1$), the level with the minimum value of $J$ has the lowest energy.\n    - For a subshell that is more than half-filled ($n  2l+1$), the level with the maximum value of $J$ has the lowest energy.\n    - For a half-filled subshell ($n = 2l+1$), $L=0$ and there is only one possible $J$ value, $J=S$.\n\nWe now analyze each configuration:\n\n**Case $p^1$ ($n=1$):**\n- One electron. Its spin is $s=1/2$, so the total spin must be $S=1/2$. The spin multiplicity is $2S+1 = 2(1/2)+1 = 2$.\n- The electron is in an $l=1$ orbital, so the total orbital angular momentum is $L=1$. The letter code for $L=1$ is P.\n- The term is ${}^2P$.\n- For $S=1/2$ and $L=1$, the possible $J$ values are $J = |1 - 1/2|, 1+1/2$, so $J \\in \\{1/2, 3/2\\}$.\n- The subshell is less than half-filled ($1  3$). Hund's third rule dictates that the minimum $J$ value corresponds to the lowest energy.\n- The ground term is ${}^2P_{1/2}$.\n\n**Case $p^2$ ($n=2$):**\n- To maximize $S$, we place the two electrons in different orbitals with parallel spins. For instance, in $m_l=+1$ and $m_l=0$, both with $m_s=+1/2$. Total spin is $S = 1/2+1/2 = 1$. Multiplicity is $2(1)+1 = 3$.\n- To maximize $L$ for this $S=1$ state, we place the electrons in the orbitals that maximize $M_L = \\sum m_l$. With parallel spins, they must occupy different orbitals. The combination is $\\{m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\} = \\{+1, 0\\}$, which gives a maximum $M_L = 1+0=1$. Thus, $L=1$. The letter code is P.\n- The ground term is ${}^3P$.\n- For $S=1$ and $L=1$, the possible $J$ values are $J = |1-1|, ..., 1+1$, so $J \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n- The subshell is less than half-filled ($2  3$). The minimum $J$ value gives the lowest energy.\n- The ground term is ${}^3P_0$.\n\n**Case $p^3$ ($n=3$):**\n- To maximize $S$, we place one electron in each of the three orbitals ($m_l=+1, 0, -1$) with parallel spins ($m_s=+1/2$). This gives $S = 1/2+1/2+1/2 = 3/2$. Multiplicity is $2(3/2)+1 = 4$.\n- The total magnetic orbital quantum number for this configuration is $M_L = (+1) + (0) + (-1) = 0$. Since this is the only arrangement that gives $S=3/2$, the maximum $L$ for this multiplicity must be $L=0$. The letter code is S.\n- The ground term is ${}^4S$.\n- For $S=3/2$ and $L=0$, the only possible $J$ value is $J = |0 - 3/2| = 3/2$.\n- The subshell is exactly half-filled ($3 = 3$). Hund's third rule is not required for selection as only one $J$ value exists.\n- The ground term is ${}^4S_{3/2}$.\n\n**Case $p^4$ ($n=4$):**\n- This configuration can be treated as having $6-4=2$ holes in a filled shell. The resulting terms are the same as for $p^2$, but the fine structure splitting is inverted. The ground term will be a ${}^3P$ term.\n- Derivation: To maximize $S$, we first half-fill the subshell with three electrons with parallel spin, then add the fourth electron with opposite spin. Configuration: $\\{m_l=+1, m_s=\\pm 1/2\\}$, $\\{m_l=0, m_s=+1/2\\}$, $\\{m_l=-1, m_s=+1/2\\}$.\n- Total spin is $S = (1/2-1/2) + 1/2 + 1/2 = 1$. Multiplicity is $3$.\n- To maximize $L$ for $S=1$, we pair the electron in the orbital that minimizes the loss of $L$. We want to keep electrons in high $m_l$ orbitals. The configuration with maximum $M_L$ for $S=1$ is $(m_l=+1, \\uparrow\\downarrow), (m_l=0, \\uparrow), (m_l=-1, \\uparrow)$. Thus $M_L = 2(+1) + 1(0) + 1(-1) = 1$. So $L=1$, which is a P term.\n- The ground term is ${}^3P$.\n- The possible $J$ values are $J \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n- The subshell is more than half-filled ($4 > 3$). Hund's third rule dictates that the maximum $J$ value corresponds to the lowest energy.\n- The ground term is ${}^3P_2$.\n\n**Case $p^5$ ($n=5$):**\n- This configuration corresponds to one hole in a filled shell, so its terms are identical to $p^1$, but with inverted fine structure. The ground term will be a ${}^2P$ term.\n- Derivation: Five electrons will fill two orbitals and half-fill the third. Configuration: $\\{m_l=+1, \\uparrow\\downarrow\\}, \\{m_l=0, \\uparrow\\downarrow\\}, \\{m_l=-1, \\uparrow\\}$.\n- Total spin is $S=1/2$. Multiplicity is $2$.\n- Total $M_L = 2(+1) + 2(0) + 1(-1) = 1$. So $L=1$, which is a P term.\n- The ground term is ${}^2P$.\n- The possible $J$ values are $J \\in \\{1/2, 3/2\\}$.\n- The subshell is more than half-filled ($5 > 3$). The maximum $J$ value gives the lowest energy.\n- The ground term is ${}^2P_{3/2}$.\n\nSummary of derived ground terms:\n$p^1: {}^2P_{1/2}$\n$p^2: {}^3P_{0}$\n$p^3: {}^4S_{3/2}$\n$p^4: {}^3P_{2}$\n$p^5: {}^2P_{3/2}$\n\nWe now evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. $p^1: {}^2P_{1/2}; \\;\\; p^2: {}^3P_{0}; \\;\\; p^3: {}^4S_{3/2}; \\;\\; p^4: {}^3P_{2}; \\;\\; p^5: {}^2P_{3/2}$**\n- $p^1: {}^2P_{1/2}$ is correct.\n- $p^2: {}^3P_0$ is correct.\n- $p^3: {}^4S_{3/2}$ is correct.\n- $p^4: {}^3P_2$ is correct.\n- $p^5: {}^2P_{3/2}$ is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.

Hund’s first rule states that, within a degenerate subshell, the arrangement with maximum spin multiplicity is favored due to exchange stabilization: parallel-spin electrons avoid each other in space more effectively, reducing electron–electron repulsion. We consider a simplified model for the total energy of a configuration that includes three contributions: (i) one-electron orbital energies, (ii) an intra-orbital pairing penalty in any doubly occupied spatial orbital, and (iii) an exchange stabilization within the $3d$ subshell that scales with the number of pairs of parallel-spin electrons distributed over distinct $3d$ orbitals.

If $\\Delta E > 0$, the aufbau configuration is favored.\n\nThe total energy change, $\\Delta E$, is the sum of the changes in the three energy contributions defined in the problem:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\Delta E_{\\text{one-electron}} + \\Delta E_{\\text{pairing}} + \\Delta E_{\\text{exchange}} $$\n\nLet us analyze each case separately.\n\n**Case 1: Chromium ($\\text{Cr}$)**\n\nWe compare the energy of the naive aufbau configuration, $[Ar]\\,3d^{4}4s^{2}$, with the promoted configuration, $[Ar]\\,3d^{5}4s^{1}$.\n\nThe energy change associated with promoting one electron from the $4s$ orbital to a $3d$ orbital has three components:\n1.  **One-electron energy change ($\\Delta E_{\\text{one-electron}}$)**: An electron is moved from an orbital of energy $\\epsilon_{4s}$ to one of energy $\\epsilon_{3d}$.\n    $$ \\Delta E_{\\text{one-electron}} = \\epsilon_{3d} - \\epsilon_{4s} = \\Delta = +0.35\\,\\text{eV} $$\n    This is an energy cost.\n\n2.  **Pairing energy change ($\\Delta E_{\\text{pairing}}$)**: This change has contributions from both the $4s$ and $3d$ subshells.\n    -   The $4s$ orbital goes from doubly occupied ($[Ar]\\,3d^{4}4s^{2}$) to singly occupied ($[Ar]\\,3d^{5}4s^{1}$). The pairing penalty $P_s$ is removed.\n        $$ \\Delta P_{4s} = 0 - P_s = -P_s = -0.70\\,\\text{eV} $$\n    -   For the $3d$ subshell, we apply Hund's first rule. In the initial $3d^4$ configuration, there are $4$ electrons with parallel spins in $4$ different orbitals to maximize multiplicity. No $3d$ orbitals are doubly occupied. In the final $3d^5$ configuration, there are $5$ electrons with parallel spins in $5$ different orbitals (a half-filled subshell). Again, no $3d$ orbitals are doubly occupied.\n        $$ \\Delta P_{3d} = 0 - 0 = 0\\,\\text{eV} $$\n    The total change in pairing energy is:\n    $$ \\Delta E_{\\text{pairing}} = \\Delta P_{4s} + \\Delta P_{3d} = -0.70\\,\\text{eV} + 0\\,\\text{eV} = -0.70\\,\\text{eV} $$\n\n3.  **Exchange energy change ($\\Delta E_{\\text{exchange}}$)**: This arises from the change in the number of pairs of parallel-spin electrons in the $3d$ subshell.\n    -   Initial state ($3d^4$): $n_\\uparrow=4, n_\\downarrow=0$. The number of parallel-spin pairs is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$. The exchange energy is $E_{\\text{exchange}}(3d^4) = -K_d \\left[ \\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{0}{2} \\right] = -6K_d$.\n    -   Final state ($3d^5$): $n_\\uparrow=5, n_\\downarrow=0$. The number of parallel-spin pairs is $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$. The exchange energy is $E_{\\text{exchange}}(3d^5) = -K_d \\left[ \\binom{5}{2} + \\binom{0}{2} \\right] = -10K_d$.\n    The change in exchange energy is:\n    $$ \\Delta E_{\\text{exchange}} = E_{\\text{exchange}}(3d^5) - E_{\\text{exchange}}(3d^4) = -10K_d - (-6K_d) = -4K_d $$\n    Using $K_d = 0.12\\,\\text{eV}$:\n    $$ \\Delta E_{\\text{exchange}} = -4 \\times 0.12\\,\\text{eV} = -0.48\\,\\text{eV} $$\n\nThe total energy change for $\\text{Cr}$ is:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{Cr}} = (+0.35) + (-0.70) + (-0.48)\\,\\text{eV} = -0.83\\,\\text{eV} $$\nSince $\\Delta E_{\\text{Cr}}  0$, the promotion is energetically favorable. The ground state configuration for $\\text{Cr}$ is correctly predicted as $[Ar]\\,3d^{5}4s^{1}$.\n\n**Case 2: Copper ($\\text{Cu}$)**\n\nWe compare the energy of the naive aufbau configuration, $[Ar]\\,3d^{9}4s^{2}$, with the promoted configuration, $[Ar]\\,3d^{10}4s^{1}$.\n\n1.  **One-electron energy change ($\\Delta E_{\\text{one-electron}}$)**: This is the same as for $\\text{Cr}$.\n    $$ \\Delta E_{\\text{one-electron}} = \\Delta = +0.35\\,\\text{eV} $$\n\n2.  **Pairing energy change ($\\Delta E_{\\text{pairing}}$)**:\n    -   The change in the $4s$ orbital is identical to the $\\text{Cr}$ case; the pairing penalty $P_s$ is removed.\n        $$ \\Delta P_{4s} = -P_s = -0.70\\,\\text{eV} $$\n    -   For the $3d$ subshell, in the initial $3d^9$ configuration, Hund's rule gives $5$ spin-up and $4$ spin-down electrons, resulting in $4$ doubly occupied orbitals. The total pairing penalty is $4P_d$. In the final $3d^{10}$ configuration, the subshell is full, with $5$ spin-up and $5$ spin-down electrons, resulting in $5$ doubly occupied orbitals. The total pairing penalty is $5P_d$.\n        $$ \\Delta P_{3d} = 5P_d - 4P_d = +P_d = +0.50\\,\\text{eV} $$\n    The total change in pairing energy is:\n    $$ \\Delta E_{\\text{pairing}} = \\Delta P_{4s} + \\Delta P_{3d} = -0.70\\,\\text{eV} + 0.50\\,\\text{eV} = -0.20\\,\\text{eV} $$\n\n3.  **Exchange energy change ($\\Delta E_{\\text{exchange}}$)**:\n    -   Initial state ($3d^9$): $n_\\uparrow=5, n_\\downarrow=4$. The exchange energy is $E_{\\text{exchange}}(3d^9) = -K_d \\left[ \\binom{5}{2} + \\binom{4}{2} \\right] = -K_d(10+6) = -16K_d$.\n    -   Final state ($3d^{10}$): $n_\\uparrow=5, n_\\downarrow=5$. The exchange energy is $E_{\\text{exchange}}(3d^{10}) = -K_d \\left[ \\binom{5}{2} + \\binom{5}{2} \\right] = -K_d(10+10) = -20K_d$.\n    The change in exchange energy is:\n    $$ \\Delta E_{\\text{exchange}} = E_{\\text{exchange}}(3d^{10}) - E_{\\text{exchange}}(3d^9) = -20K_d - (-16K_d) = -4K_d $$\n    Using $K_d = 0.12\\,\\text{eV}$:\n    $$ \\Delta E_{\\text{exchange}} = -4 \\times 0.12\\,\\text{eV} = -0.48\\,\\text{eV} $$\n\nThe total energy change for $\\text{Cu}$ is:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{Cu}} = (+0.35) + (-0.20) + (-0.48)\\,\\text{eV} = -0.33\\,\\text{eV} $$\nSince $\\Delta E_{\\text{Cu}}  0$, the promotion is also energetically favorable for $\\text{Cu}$. The ground state configuration for $\\text{Cu}$ is correctly predicted as $[Ar]\\,3d^{10}4s^{1}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nOur calculations show that for both chromium and copper, the energy change for the $4s \\rightarrow 3d$ promotion is negative, meaning the promoted configurations are lower in energy.\n- For $\\text{Cr}$, $\\Delta E_{\\text{Cr}} = -0.83\\,\\text{eV}$, so $[Ar]\\,3d^{5}4s^{1}$ is favored over $[Ar]\\,3d^{4}4s^{2}$.\n- For $\\text{Cu}$, $\\Delta E_{\\text{Cu}} = -0.33\\,\\text{eV}$, so $[Ar]\\,3d^{10}4s^{1}$ is favored over $[Ar]\\,3d^{9}4s^{2}$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given statements:\n\nA. Both $\\text{Cr}$ and $\\text{Cu}$ favor a single $4s\\rightarrow 3d$ promotion, consistent with $[Ar]\\,3d^{5}4s^{1}$ and $[Ar]\\,3d^{10}4s^{1}$ as lower in energy than $[Ar]\\,3d^{4}4s^{2}$ and $[Ar]\\,3d^{9}4s^{2}$.\nThis statement is fully consistent with our calculations. **Correct**.\n\nB. Only $\\text{Cr}$ favors the promotion; $\\text{Cu}$ is lower as $[Ar]\\,3d^{9}4s^{2}$.\nThis is incorrect. Our calculation shows that $\\text{Cu}$ also favors the promotion. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Only $\\text{Cu}$ favors the promotion; $\\text{Cr}$ is lower as $[Ar]\\,3d^{4}4s^{2}$.\nThis is incorrect. Our calculation shows that $\\text{Cr}$ also favors the promotion. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Neither $\\text{Cr}$ nor $\\text{Cu}$ favors the promotion; both naive aufbau configurations are lower in energy.\nThis is incorrect. Our calculations show that both elements favor the promotion. **Incorrect**.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2941250"}]}
