Therefore, we may proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe task is to derive the scaling of transition energy and wavelength with nuclear charge $Z$ for a hydrogen-like system, starting from first principles.\n\nFirst, we model the system as a single electron of charge $-e$ and mass $m_e$ in a circular orbit of radius $r$ around a nucleus of charge $+Ze$. The electrostatic Coulomb force provides the necessary centripetal force for this uniform circular motion.\n\nCoulomb's Law gives the attractive force $F_C$:\n$$ F_C = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{(Ze)(e)}{r^2} = k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r^2} $$\nwhere $k_e$ is the Coulomb constant.\n\nThe centripetal force $F_{cen}$ required to keep the electron in a circular orbit of radius $r$ at speed $v$ is:\n$$ F_{cen} = \\frac{m_e v^2}{r} $$\n\nEquating these two forces, $F_C = F_{cen}$, gives our first fundamental relation:\n$$ k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r^2} = \\frac{m_e v^2}{r} \\implies m_e v^2 = k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r} $$\n\nNext, we apply the Bohr quantization postulate for angular momentum, $L$. The angular momentum of the electron is $L = m_e v r$, and it is quantized in integer multiples of the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$:\n$$ L = m_e v r = n\\hbar, \\quad \\text{where } n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots $$\nFrom this, we can express the speed $v$ as $v = \\frac{n\\hbar}{m_e r}$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $v$ into the force balance equation:\n$$ m_e \\left( \\frac{n\\hbar}{m_e r} \\right)^2 = k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r} $$\n$$ m_e \\frac{n^2\\hbar^2}{m_e^2 r^2} = k_e \\frac{Ze^2}{r} $$\n$$ \\frac{n^2\\hbar^2}{m_e r} = k_e Ze^2 $$\n\nSolving for the radius $r$ gives the quantized orbital radii, $r_n$:\n$$ r_n = \\frac{n^2\\hbar^2}{k_e m_e Z e^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{k_e m_e e^2}\\right) \\frac{n^2}{Z} $$\nWe can identify the Bohr radius, $a_0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{k_e m_e e^2}$, which is the radius of the ground state of hydrogen ($n=1, Z=1$).

The first-order correction, which we denote $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{KE}}$, is the next term in the series:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{KE}} \\sim - \\frac{p^4}{8 m^3 c^2} $$\nTo estimate the magnitude of this energy correction, we relate the momentum to the nonrelativistic energy. The expectation value of the nonrelativistic kinetic energy is $\\langle T_{\\mathrm{nr}} \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle p^2 \\rangle}{2m}$. According to the virial theorem, $\\langle T_{\\mathrm{nr}} \\rangle = |E_n|$. Therefore, we can estimate $\\langle p^2 \\rangle \\sim 2m |E_n|$. Substituting this into our expression for the energy correction:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{KE}} \\sim - \\frac{(2m|E_n|)^2}{8 m^3 c^2} = - \\frac{4 m^2 |E_n|^2}{8 m^3 c^2} = - \\frac{|E_n|^2}{2 m c^2} $$\nThe fractional correction relative to the nonrelativistic binding energy is:\n$$ \\frac{|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{KE}}|}{|E_n|} \\sim \\frac{|E_n|}{2 m c^2} $$\nUsing the given scaling for $|E_n| \\sim \\tfrac{1}{2} m c^2 \\frac{\\alpha^2}{n^2}$, we find the scaling of the fractional correction:\n$$ \\frac{|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{KE}}|}{|E_n|} \\sim \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} m c^2 \\frac{\\alpha^2}{n^2}}{2 m c^2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{\\alpha^2}{n^2} $$\nThis shows that the fractional kinetic energy correction scales with $\\alpha^2$.\n\n2.  **Spin–Orbit Coupling**\n\nThe spin-orbit interaction arises from the interaction of the electron's intrinsic magnetic dipole moment, $\\vec{\\mu}_s$, with the magnetic field, $\\vec{B}$, it experiences in its rest frame due to the nucleus's apparent motion. The interaction Hamiltonian, including the Thomas precession factor of $1/2$, can be written as:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{SO}} = \\frac{1}{2 m^2 c^2} \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{dV}{dr} (\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{S}) $$\nFor the Coulomb potential $V(r) = - \\frac{Z e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r}$ (with $Z=1$ for hydrogen), the derivative is $\\frac{dV}{dr} = \\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r^2}$. Substituting this gives:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{SO}} \\sim \\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{m^2 c^2 r^3} (\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{S}) $$\nThe angular momenta are quantized and of order $\\hbar$, so we take $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{S} \\sim \\hbar^2$. Using the definition of the fine-structure constant, $\\alpha = \\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\hbar c}$, we can write the energy correction as:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{SO}} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha \\hbar c}{m^2 c^2} \\hbar^2 \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{r^3} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\alpha \\hbar^3}{m^2 c} \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{r^3} \\right\\rangle $$\nWhile the average radius scales as $\\langle r \\rangle \\sim a_0 n^2$, the expectation value $\\langle r^{-3} \\rangle$ scales differently. From either exact solution of the Schrödinger equation or semiclassical arguments (correspondence principle), it is a standard result for hydrogenic states that $\\langle r^{-3} \\rangle \\sim \\frac{1}{a_0^3 n^3}$ for states with non-zero angular momentum. Using this scaling, and the definition of the Bohr radius $a_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{m c \\alpha}$:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{SO}} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha \\hbar^3}{m^2 c} \\frac{1}{a_0^3 n^3} = \\frac{\\alpha \\hbar^3}{m^2 c n^3} \\left( \\frac{m c \\alpha}{\\hbar} \\right)^3 = \\frac{\\alpha \\hbar^3}{m^2 c n^3} \\frac{m^3 c^3 \\alpha^3}{\\hbar^3} = m c^2 \\frac{\\alpha^4}{n^3} $$\nThe fractional correction is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{SO}}|}{|E_n|} \\sim \\frac{m c^2 \\frac{\\alpha^4}{n^3}}{\\frac{1}{2} m c^2 \\frac{\\alpha^2}{n^2}} = 2 \\frac{\\alpha^2}{n} $$\nThis fractional correction also scales with $\\alpha^2$.\n\n3.  **Darwin Term**\n\nThe Darwin term is a contact interaction that arises from the smearing of the electron's position over a length scale comparable to its Compton wavelength (a phenomenon known as Zitterbewegung). This affects only s-states ($l=0$) which have a non-zero probability density at the nucleus. The interaction Hamiltonian is proportional to a Dirac delta function at the origin:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{\\pi \\hbar^2}{2 m^2 c^2} \\left( \\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\right) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}) $$\nThe energy shift is the expectation value of this Hamiltonian, which is $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\langle H_{\\mathrm{D}} \\rangle$. This involves the value of the squared wavefunction at the origin, $|\\psi(0)|^2$.\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{\\pi \\hbar^2 (\\alpha \\hbar c)}{2 m^2 c^2} |\\psi(0)|^2 = \\frac{\\pi \\alpha \\hbar^3}{2 m^2 c} |\\psi(0)|^2 $$\nFor a hydrogenic s-state, the squared wavefunction at the origin scales as $|\\psi(0)|^2 \\sim \\frac{1}{a_0^3 n^3}$. This is a standard result from the solution of the Schrödinger equation. Substituting this scaling:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{D}} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha \\hbar^3}{m^2 c} \\frac{1}{a_0^3 n^3} $$\nThis expression is, up to a dimensionless prefactor, identical to the one derived for the spin-orbit coupling. The subsequent calculation is also identical:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{D}} \\sim m c^2 \\frac{\\alpha^4}{n^3} $$\nAnd the fractional correction is:\n$$ \\frac{|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{D}}|}{|E_n|} \\sim \\frac{m c^2 \\frac{\\alpha^4}{n^3}}{\\frac{1}{2} m c^2 \\frac{\\alpha^2}{n^2}} = 2 \\frac{\\alpha^2}{n} $$\nLike the other two contributions, this fractional correction scales with $\\alpha^2$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll three contributions to the fine-structure energy, $\\Delta E_{fs}$, result in a fractional correction, $|\\Delta E|/|E_n|$, that is proportional to $\\alpha^2$. Specifically:\n$$ \\frac{|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{KE}}|}{|E_n|} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha^2}{n^2}, \\quad \\frac{|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{SO}}|}{|E_n|} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha^2}{n}, \\quad \\frac{|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{D}}|}{|E_n|} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha^2}{n} $$\nThe total fine-structure correction $|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{fs}}| = |\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{KE}} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{SO}} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{D}}|$ will be a sum of these terms. Regardless of the specific $n$-dependence or the numerical prefactors for each term, the leading and governing dependence on the fine-structure constant for the combined fractional correction $|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{fs}}|/|E_n|$ is unambiguously $\\alpha^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\alpha^2}$$", "id": "2919317"}]}
