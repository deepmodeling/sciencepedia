The chemical reaction provided is a classic example of heterogeneous equilibrium. The concept of an ideal solid solution is a standard model in materials science and physical chemistry.

A unique and correct evaluation is possible for each statement.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-constructed exercise in chemical thermodynamics. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\nThe thermodynamic equilibrium constant, $K$, for the reaction $\\text{CaCO}_3\\text{(s)} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{CaO(s)} + \\text{CO}_2\\text{(g)}$ is derived from the condition $\\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i = 0$. This gives $\\mu_{\\mathrm{CaO}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}} = 0$. Using the definition of activity, $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^\\dagger + RT \\ln a_i$, we obtain:\n$$ \\Delta_rG^\\circ = \\mu_{\\mathrm{CaO}}^\\dagger + \\mu_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}^\\dagger - \\mu_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}^\\dagger = -RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{CaO}} \\cdot a_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}}{a_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}} \\right) $$\nThus, the equilibrium constant is\n$$ K = \\exp(-\\Delta_rG^\\circ/RT) = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{CaO}} \\cdot a_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}}{a_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}} $$\nThis exact relation forms the basis for evaluating the provided options.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. For any pure condensed phase whose standard state is defined as the pure phase at the system’s $T$ and $P$ (the Lewis–Randall type standard state for condensed phases), its activity is exactly $a=1$ by definition, independent of the amount present.**\nThe activity $a_i$ is defined by the relation $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^\\dagger + RT \\ln a_i$. For a pure condensed phase, its chemical potential $\\mu_i$ is a function of system temperature $T$ and pressure $P$, i.e., $\\mu_i = \\mu_i(T,P)$. If the standard state is chosen as the pure phase at the same $T$ and $P$, then the standard chemical potential $\\mu_i^\\dagger$ is, by definition, equal to $\\mu_i(T,P)$. Substituting these into the activity definition yields $\\mu_i(T,P) = \\mu_i(T,P) + RT \\ln a_i$. This equation is satisfied only if $RT \\ln a_i = 0$, which requires $a_i=1$. This holds true regardless of the quantity of the pure phase, as chemical potential is an intensive property.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. If instead the standard state of a condensed phase is defined at a fixed reference pressure $P^\\circ$, then at pressure $P$ the activity of a pure condensed phase is $a=\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{RT}\\int_{P^\\circ}^{P}\\bar V\\, dP\\right)$, which is generally not equal to $1$ when $P\\neq P^\\circ$.**\nThe fundamental relation for the change in chemical potential (molar Gibbs energy for a pure substance) with pressure at constant temperature is $d\\mu = \\bar{V} dP$, where $\\bar{V}$ is the molar volume. Integrating this from the standard state pressure $P^\\circ$ to the system pressure $P$ gives $\\mu(T,P) - \\mu(T,P^\\circ) = \\int_{P^\\circ}^P \\bar{V} dP$. The standard chemical potential is $\\mu^\\dagger = \\mu(T, P^\\circ)$. Therefore, the chemical potential at system pressure is $\\mu(T,P) = \\mu^\\dagger + \\int_{P^\\circ}^P \\bar{V} dP$. Comparing this with the definition of activity, $\\mu(T,P) = \\mu^\\dagger + RT \\ln a$, we equate the terms: $RT \\ln a = \\int_{P^\\circ}^P \\bar{V} dP$. Solving for $a$ gives $a = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{RT}\\int_{P^\\circ}^P \\bar{V} dP\\right)$. Since $\\bar{V}  0$, this integral is non-zero if $P \\neq P^\\circ$, and thus $a \\neq 1$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. In case $2$, assuming an ideal substitutional solid solution so that $a_{\\mathrm{CaO}} = x_{\\mathrm{CaO}}$, the equilibrium partial pressure $p_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$ varies inversely with $x_{\\mathrm{CaO}}$ at fixed $T$ and $P$.**\nIn case $2$, the solid $\\mathrm{CaCO_3}$ is pure, so we take $a_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}} = 1$ (using the standard state from option A). The oxide is an ideal solid solution, so the activity of calcium oxide is its mole fraction, $a_{\\mathrm{CaO}} = x_{\\mathrm{CaO}}$. The gas $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is ideal, so its activity is $a_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = p_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}/P^\\circ$. Substituting these into the equilibrium constant expression:\n$$ K = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{CaO}} \\cdot a_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}}{a_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}} = \\frac{x_{\\mathrm{CaO}} \\cdot (p_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}/P^\\circ)}{1} $$\nRearranging to solve for the partial pressure of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = \\frac{K P^\\circ}{x_{\\mathrm{CaO}}} $$\nAt a fixed temperature, $K$ is a constant. $P^\\circ$ is the standard pressure, also a constant. Therefore, $p_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$ is inversely proportional to $x_{\\mathrm{CaO}}$. The statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. In the wüstite field, where the stable oxide is the nonstoichiometric solid $\\mathrm{Fe}_{1-x}\\mathrm{O(s)}$, treating the solid as if it were a pure component with $a=1$ yields a composition-independent equilibrium constant $K_p$ for oxygen exchange; equivalently, the equilibrium $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ does not depend on $x$.**\nThis statement describes the outcome of an incorrect physical assumption. Wüstite, $\\mathrm{Fe}_{1-x}\\mathrm{O}$, is a non-stoichiometric compound, which is a solid solution. Its thermodynamic properties, including the activity of the \"FeO\" component, are functions of the composition variable $x$. Setting its activity to $a=1$ is a violation of correct thermodynamic principles. While it is true that this fallacious assumption *would lead* to the incorrect conclusion that the equilibrium oxygen partial pressure $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is independent of $x$, the statement itself is not a thermodynamically correct description of the wüstite system. In reality, the activity of FeO in wüstite, $a_{\\mathrm{FeO}}(x)$, varies significantly with $x$, and consequently, the equilibrium $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is strongly dependent on composition. A statement asked to be evaluated for scientific correctness must be judged against reality, not against the consequences of flawed models.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. For an ideal substitutional solid solution at fixed $T$ and $P$, the activity of component $i$ equals its mole fraction $x_i$, and the Gibbs–Duhem equation imposes $\\sum_i x_i\\, d\\mu_i = 0$, so changing $x_j$ couples the chemical potentials and activities of all components.**\nThe statement contains three parts. First, for an ideal solution, $a_i = x_i$ is correct by definition (with the pure component as reference state). Second, the Gibbs-Duhem equation at constant $T$ and $P$, $\\sum_i x_i d\\mu_i = 0$, is a fundamental thermodynamic relation for any mixture. Third, the consequence of this coupling. The mole fractions in a mixture are constrained by $\\sum_i x_i = 1$, which implies $\\sum_i dx_i = 0$. A change in one mole fraction, $dx_j$, necessitates a change in at least one other, $dx_k$. Since $\\mu_i$ depends on $x_i$ (e.g., $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\ln x_i$ for an ideal solution), a change in the set of mole fractions necessarily changes the chemical potentials. The Gibbs-Duhem equation is the precise mathematical form of this coupling, showing that changes in the chemical potentials are not independent (e.g., for a binary system, $d\\mu_2 = -(x_1/x_2) d\\mu_1$). The statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**F. For a liquid–vapor equilibrium under the Raoult’s-law standard state for liquids, the activity of the liquid component equals $a = p/p^\\ast(T)$ when the solution is ideal with respect to that component; consequently, for the pure liquid coexisting with its own vapor at $T$, $a=1$ because $p=p^\\ast(T)$.**\nThe standard state is the pure liquid at system $T$ and $P$. The activity of component $i$ in the liquid solution is defined via $\\mu_i^{(l)} = \\mu_i^{*(l)}(T,P) + RT \\ln a_i$. At equilibrium, $\\mu_i^{(l)} = \\mu_i^{(g)}(T,p_i)$. Ignoring the small effect of total pressure on the liquid's chemical potential (justified by the given weak compressibility), we can approximate $\\mu_i^{*(l)}(T,P) \\approx \\mu_i^{*(l)}(T, \\text{sat}) = \\mu_i^{(g)}(T,p_i^\\ast)$, where $p_i^\\ast$ is the vapor pressure of pure liquid $i$. Thus, we have $\\mu_i^{(g)}(T,p_i) = \\mu_i^{(g)}(T,p_i^\\ast) + RT \\ln a_i$. Using the expression for an ideal gas, $\\mu_i^{(g)} = \\mu^{\\circ(g)} + RT \\ln(p_i/P^\\circ)$, we find $RT\\ln(p_i/P^\\circ) = RT\\ln(p_i^\\ast/P^\\circ) + RT\\ln a_i$, which simplifies to $a_i = p_i/p_i^\\ast$. The problem uses $p$ instead of $p_i$; this assumes a single component vapor but the logic is the same. For an ideal solution component, this is correct. For a pure liquid, it is in equilibrium with its own vapor, so its partial pressure $p_i$ is simply the total pressure $p$, which is by definition the vapor pressure $p_i^\\ast(T)$. Therefore, $a_i = p_i^\\ast / p_i^\\ast = 1$. The logic is sound.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**G. For the decomposition of $\\mathrm{CaCO_3(s)}$, it is always valid to write $K_p = p_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}/P^\\circ$ irrespective of whether the coexisting oxide phase is a pure $\\mathrm{CaO(s)}$ or a $(\\mathrm{Ca},\\mathrm{Mg})\\mathrm{O(s)}$ solid solution, because condensed phases do not appear explicitly in $K_p$.**\nThis statement is false. As shown in the general derivation, the thermodynamic equilibrium constant is $K = (a_{\\mathrm{CaO}} \\cdot a_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}) / a_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}$. In case 1 (pure solids), $a_{\\mathrm{CaO}}=1$ and $a_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}=1$, leading to $K = a_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = p_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}/P^\\circ$. In case 2 (solid solution), $a_{\\mathrm{CaO}}  1$ (e.g., $a_{\\mathrm{CaO}}=x_{\\mathrm{CaO}}$ for an ideal solution), so $K = (a_{\\mathrm{CaO}} \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{CO_2}})/P^\\circ$. Clearly, the expression for $K$ depends on the activity of the solid oxide. The expression $p_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}/P^\\circ$ is NOT equal to the constant $K$ in case 2; it is equal to $K/a_{\\mathrm{CaO}}$. Since $a_{\\mathrm{CaO}}$ is not constant, $p_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}/P^\\circ$ is not constant. The justification \"because condensed phases do not appear explicitly in $K_p$\" is a common misconception; they are omitted only when their activities are unity, an assumption which is explicitly violated in case 2. The statement is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCEF}$$", "id": "2938551"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the concept of activity, this practice moves from conceptual understanding to quantitative application.

The Debye-Hückel limiting law is used for ionic solutions, and the virial equation of state is used for non-ideal gases. These are fundamental and appropriate concepts for this context. The problem is well-posed, asking for sufficient conditions on ionic strength ($I$) and pressure ($P$) to satisfy a given error tolerance. This is a mathematically deterministic question. All necessary data (constants, virial coefficients, reaction stoichiometries, temperature) are provided to perform the required calculations. The language is objective and precise. The physical values are realistic. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare the true thermodynamic equilibrium constant, $K_a$, with an approximate form where activities are replaced by concentrations or partial pressures. The relative error is defined as $|\\frac{K_{approx}}{K_a} - 1|$.\n\n**Analysis of System 1 (Aqueous Reaction)**\n\nThe reaction is $\\text{Fe}^{3+}\\text{(aq)} + \\text{SCN}^-\\text{(aq)} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{FeSCN}^{2+}\\text{(aq)}$.\nThe thermodynamic equilibrium constant is $K_a = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{FeSCN^{2+}}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}} a_{\\mathrm{SCN^-}}}$.\nThe activity of an ion $j$ is given by $a_j = \\gamma_j \\frac{c_j}{c^\\circ}$, where $\\gamma_j$ is the activity coefficient and $c_j$ is its molar concentration.\nThe approximation involves replacing activities by molar concentrations, which is equivalent to assuming all activity coefficients are unity ($\\gamma_j = 1$). The approximate (dimensionless) equilibrium constant is $K_{approx} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{FeSCN^{2+}}}/c^\\circ}{(c_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}}/c^\\circ)(c_{\\mathrm{SCN^-}}/c^\\circ)}$.\nThe ratio of the approximate constant to the true constant is:\n$$ \\frac{K_{approx}}{K_a} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{FeSCN^{2+}}}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{SCN^-}}}} = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{SCN^-}}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{FeSCN^{2+}}}} $$\nLet this ratio of activity coefficients be $K_\\gamma^{-1}$. The relative error is $|K_\\gamma^{-1} - 1|$.\n\nWe use the Debye-Hückel limiting law to find the activity coefficients: $\\log_{10} \\gamma_j = -A z_j^2 \\sqrt{I/(c^\\circ)}$. With $c^\\circ=1\\,\\mathrm{M}$, we have $\\log_{10} \\gamma_j = -A z_j^2 \\sqrt{I}$.\nTaking the logarithm of the ratio:\n$$ \\log_{10} (K_\\gamma^{-1}) = \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}}) + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SCN^-}}) - \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{FeSCN^{2+}}}) $$\n$$ \\log_{10} (K_\\gamma^{-1}) = -A \\sqrt{I} \\left( z_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}}^2 + z_{\\mathrm{SCN^-}}^2 - z_{\\mathrm{FeSCN^{2+}}}^2 \\right) $$\nThe charges are $z_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}} = +3$, $z_{\\mathrm{SCN^-}} = -1$, and $z_{\\mathrm{FeSCN^{2+}}} = +2$.\n$$ \\log_{10} (K_\\gamma^{-1}) = -A \\sqrt{I} \\left( (3)^2 + (-1)^2 - (2)^2 \\right) = -A \\sqrt{I} (9 + 1 - 4) = -6 A \\sqrt{I} $$\nSubstituting $A = 0.509$:\n$$ \\log_{10} (K_\\gamma^{-1}) = -6(0.509)\\sqrt{I} = -3.054 \\sqrt{I} $$\nThus, $K_\\gamma^{-1} = 10^{-3.054\\sqrt{I}}$.\nSince $I  0$, this ratio is less than $1$. The relative error is $1 - K_\\gamma^{-1} = 1 - 10^{-3.054\\sqrt{I}}$.\nWe require this error to be at most $5\\%$, or $0.05$.\n$$ 1 - 10^{-3.054\\sqrt{I}} \\le 0.05 $$\n$$ 0.95 \\le 10^{-3.054\\sqrt{I}} $$\nTaking the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\log_{10}(0.95) \\le -3.054\\sqrt{I} $$\n$$ -0.02228 \\le -3.054\\sqrt{I} $$\n$$ \\sqrt{I} \\le \\frac{0.02228}{3.054} \\approx 0.007295 $$\n$$ I \\le (0.007295)^2 \\approx 5.32 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M} $$\nThis inequality gives the maximum ionic strength for which the error is within the $5\\%$ tolerance. Any condition stricter than this is sufficient.\n\nA. For System 1, if $I \\le 4.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$, then replacing activities by molar concentrations yields a relative error in the equilibrium constant below $5\\%$.\nThe condition $I \\le 4.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ is more restrictive than our derived limit of $I \\le 5.32 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$. Therefore, if this condition is met, the error will indeed be less than $5\\%$. **Correct**.\n\nD. For System 1, if $I \\le 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$, then replacing activities by molar concentrations yields a relative error in the equilibrium constant below $5\\%$.\nThis condition is much less restrictive than our derived limit. At $I = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$, the relative error would be $1 - 10^{-3.054\\sqrt{0.001}} \\approx 1 - 10^{-0.09657} \\approx 1 - 0.8005 = 0.1995$, or $19.95\\%$. This exceeds the $5\\%$ tolerance. The condition is not sufficient. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of System 2 (Gas Phase Reaction)**\n\nThe reaction is $\\text{A(g)} \\rightleftharpoons 2\\text{B(g)}$.\nThe thermodynamic equilibrium constant is $K_a = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{B}}^2}{a_{\\mathrm{A}}}$. The activity of a gas component $j$ is $a_j = f_j/P^\\circ = (\\phi_j P_j)/P^\\circ$, where $f_j$ is its fugacity, $\\phi_j$ is its fugacity coefficient, and $P_j$ is its partial pressure.\nThe approximation replaces activities with partial pressures (divided by standard pressure), which is equivalent to assuming fugacity coefficients are unity ($\\phi_j=1$). The approximate constant is $K_{approx} = \\frac{(P_{\\mathrm{B}}/P^\\circ)^2}{P_{\\mathrm{A}}/P^\\circ}$.\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{K_{approx}}{K_a} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\phi_{\\mathrm{B}}^2}{\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}}}} = \\frac{\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\phi_{\\mathrm{B}}^2} $$\nLet this ratio be $K_\\phi^{-1}$. The relative error is $|K_\\phi^{-1} - 1|$.\n\nFor a component $j$ in a gas mixture at moderate pressures, the fugacity coefficient can be approximated using the Lewis-Randall rule, $\\ln \\phi_j \\approx \\frac{B_{jj}P}{RT}$, where $B_{jj}$ is the second virial coefficient of pure $j$ and $P$ is the total pressure.\nTaking the natural logarithm of the ratio:\n$$ \\ln(K_\\phi^{-1}) = \\ln(\\phi_{\\mathrm{A}}) - 2\\ln(\\phi_{\\mathrm{B}}) \\approx \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{A}}P}{RT} - 2\\frac{B_{\\mathrm{B}}P}{RT} = \\frac{P}{RT}(B_{\\mathrm{A}} - 2B_{\\mathrm{B}}) $$\nThe virial coefficients must be in appropriate units: $B_{\\mathrm{A}} = -70\\,\\mathrm{cm^3\\,mol^{-1}} = -0.070\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}}$ and $B_{\\mathrm{B}} = -120\\,\\mathrm{cm^3\\,mol^{-1}} = -0.120\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{A}} - 2B_{\\mathrm{B}} = -0.070 - 2(-0.120) = -0.070 + 0.240 = 0.170\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nThe product $RT$ is $(0.08314\\,\\mathrm{L\\,bar\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 24.776\\,\\mathrm{L\\,bar\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n$$ \\ln(K_\\phi^{-1}) \\approx \\frac{P \\cdot (0.170\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}})}{24.776\\,\\mathrm{L\\,bar\\,mol^{-1}}} \\approx (0.00686\\,\\mathrm{bar^{-1}}) P $$\nSo, $K_\\phi^{-1} \\approx e^{0.00686P}$. Since $P0$, $K_\\phi^{-1}  1$.\nThe relative error is $e^{0.00686P} - 1$.\n\nWe now check the criteria for the two tolerances.\nFor a $5\\%$ tolerance:\n$$ e^{0.00686P} - 1 \\le 0.05 \\implies e^{0.00686P} \\le 1.05 $$\n$$ 0.00686P \\le \\ln(1.05) \\approx 0.04879 $$\n$$ P \\le \\frac{0.04879}{0.00686} \\approx 7.11\\,\\mathrm{bar} $$\nFor a $1\\%$ tolerance:\n$$ e^{0.00686P} - 1 \\le 0.01 \\implies e^{0.00686P} \\le 1.01 $$\n$$ 0.00686P \\le \\ln(1.01) \\approx 0.00995 $$\n$$ P \\le \\frac{0.00995}{0.00686} \\approx 1.45\\,\\mathrm{bar} $$\n\nB. For System 2, with the data above and at $298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, if $P \\le 3.0\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, then replacing activities by partial pressures (divided by $P^\\circ$) yields a relative error in the equilibrium constant below $5\\%$.\nThe condition $P \\le 3.0\\,\\mathrm{bar}$ is more restrictive than the derived limit of $P \\le 7.11\\,\\mathrm{bar}$ for a $5\\%$ error. This condition is therefore sufficient. **Correct**.\n\nE. For System 2, with the data above and at $298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, if a stricter $1\\%$ tolerance is required, then $P \\le 0.70\\,\\mathrm{bar}$ suffices for replacing activities by partial pressures (divided by $P^\\circ$).\nThe condition $P \\le 0.70\\,\\mathrm{bar}$ is more restrictive than the derived limit of $P \\le 1.45\\,\\mathrm{bar}$ for a $1\\%$ error. This condition is therefore sufficient. **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\nC. For any gas-phase reaction with $\\Delta \\nu = 0$ (the sum of stoichiometric coefficients of gaseous species equals zero), one may always use partial pressures in place of activities at any pressure, because nonideality cancels exactly.\nThis statement claims that if $\\Delta \\nu = \\sum_j \\nu_j = 0$, then $K_\\phi=\\prod_j \\phi_j^{\\nu_j}=1$ for any pressure. This would require $\\ln(K_\\phi) = \\sum_j \\nu_j \\ln(\\phi_j) = 0$.\nUsing the same approximation as before, $\\ln \\phi_j \\approx \\frac{B_{jj}P}{RT}$:\n$$ \\sum_j \\nu_j \\ln(\\phi_j) \\approx \\frac{P}{RT} \\sum_j \\nu_j B_{jj} $$\nFor this to be zero at any pressure $P$, the condition must be $\\sum_j \\nu_j B_{jj} = 0$. The virial coefficient $B_{jj}$ is a property of the individual substance $j$. There is no physical law stating that this specific combination of virial coefficients must be zero just because the stoichiometric coefficients sum to zero. For a general reaction $\\text{H}_2 + \\text{I}_2 \\rightleftharpoons 2\\text{HI}$, $\\Delta\\nu=0$, but $2B_{\\mathrm{HI}} - B_{\\mathrm{H_2}} - B_{\\mathrm{I_2}}$ is generally not zero. Therefore, non-ideality does not cancel out in general, and the statement is false. The approximation $K_a \\approx K_p'$ only becomes exact for all gases as $P \\to 0$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Summary**\n- Option A is correct.\n- Option B is correct.\n- Option C is incorrect.\n- Option D is incorrect.\n- Option E is correct.\nThe correct options are A, B, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2938508"}]}
