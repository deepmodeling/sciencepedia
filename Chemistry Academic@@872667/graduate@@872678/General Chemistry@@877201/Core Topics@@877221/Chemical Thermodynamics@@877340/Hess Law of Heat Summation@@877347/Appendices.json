It reveals the distinction between a precise thermodynamic quantity and an approximation.\n\n$1$. **Enthalpies of Formation are Exact:** The standard enthalpy of formation, $\\Delta H_f^\\circ$, is a rigorously defined thermodynamic quantity. It measures the enthalpy change when one mole of a specific compound is formed from its constituent elements in their most stable reference states at standard conditions. The calculation using $\\Delta H_f^\\circ$ values is, therefore, an accurate determination of the true enthalpy change between the initial state (cis-2-butene) and the final state (trans-2-butene). It correctly captures all energetic contributions, including those from electronic structure and molecular geometry.\n\n$2$. **Average Bond Enthalpies are Approximations:** Average bond enthalpy is a conceptual tool, not an exact property of a bond in a specific molecule. The tabulated value for a $\\text{C}-\\text{H}$ bond, for instance, is an average taken over many different chemical compounds. The actual energy of a $\\text{C}-\\text{H}$ bond depends on its specific molecular environment (e.g., hybridization, adjacent functional groups, steric interactions). The bond-enthalpy method approximates a molecule's enthalpy of atomization by summing these average values.\n\n$3$. **Physical Origin of the Discrepancy:** The isomerization from cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene involves a change in molecular geometry, not in bond connectivity. In the cis isomer, the two bulky methyl ($\\text{CH}_3$) groups are on the same side of the $\\text{C}=\\text{C}$ double bond, leading to repulsive steric strain (a form of van der Waals repulsion). This strain destabilizes the molecule, raising its enthalpy. In the trans isomer, the methyl groups are on opposite sides, minimizing this repulsion. The trans isomer is therefore more stable (lower in enthalpy) than the cis isomer. The bond-enthalpy method, by its very nature, is insensitive to such stereochemical differences, incorrectly predicting $\\Delta H_{\\text{bond}} = 0$. The calculation from $\\Delta H_f^\\circ$ values, however, correctly reflects this stability difference, yielding $\\Delta H_{\\text{Hess}} = -5.68 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. The discrepancy, $\\Delta = 5.68 \\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, is therefore a quantitative measure of the stabilization energy of the trans isomer relative to the cis isomer (or, equivalently, the destabilizing steric strain energy in the cis isomer) that the average bond enthalpy model fails to capture.\n\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures as requested gives $5.680$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{5.680} $$", "id": "2940986"}]}
