The calorimeter is operated with an isothermal jacket adjusted such that, during a short heating pulse, heat exchange with the surroundings is negligible relative to the electrical energy delivered. The calorimeter is therefore effectively adiabatic over the pulse, and the pressure-volume work is zero because the volume is fixed. The goal is to determine the calorimeter energy equivalent (calorimeter heat capacity), denoted $C_{\\text{cal}}$, defined for small temperature excursions by the proportionality between the energy absorbed and the temperature rise.\n\nStarting from first principles, formulate the energy balance for the calorimeter treated as a closed system that includes the water, vessel, and immersed heater but excludes the external power supply.
