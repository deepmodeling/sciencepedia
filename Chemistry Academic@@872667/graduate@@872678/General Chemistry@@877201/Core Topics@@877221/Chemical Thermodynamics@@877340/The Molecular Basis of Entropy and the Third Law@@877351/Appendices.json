Solving for $\\alpha$:\n$$1 - \\alpha = \\frac{7.68}{3 \\times 8.314\\,462\\,618} \\implies \\alpha \\approx 1 - 0.307900 = 0.692100$$\nWe proceed with the integration. The entropy contribution from $0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $40\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is:\n$$\\Delta S_{0 \\to 40} = \\int_{0}^{40} \\frac{\\beta T^3}{T} dT = \\int_{0}^{40} \\beta T^2 dT = \\left[ \\frac{\\beta T^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{40} = \\frac{\\beta (40)^3}{3}$$\nThis evaluates to:\n$$\\Delta S_{0 \\to 40} = \\frac{7.68\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}}{3} = 2.56\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\nThe entropy contribution from $40\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is:\n$$\\Delta S_{40 \\to 298} = \\int_{40}^{298} \\frac{3R}{T}\\left[1 - \\alpha \\left(\\frac{40}{T}\\right)\\right] dT = \\int_{40}^{298} \\left( \\frac{3R}{T} - \\frac{120 R \\alpha}{T^2} \\right) dT$$\n$$\\Delta S_{40 \\to 298} = \\left[ 3R \\ln(T) + \\frac{120 R \\alpha}{T} \\right]_{40}^{298}$$\n$$= \\left( 3R \\ln(298) + \\frac{120 R \\alpha}{298} \\right) - \\left( 3R \\ln(40) + \\frac{120 R \\alpha}{40} \\right)$$\n$$= 3R \\ln\\left(\\frac{298}{40}\\right) + 120 R \\alpha \\left(\\frac{1}{298} - \\frac{1}{40}\\right)$$\nSubstituting numerical values:\n$$3R \\ln\\left(\\frac{298}{40}\\right) = (24.943388...) \\times \\ln(7.45) \\approx 50.093339\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\nThe term $120 R \\alpha$ can be expressed as $40(3R\\alpha) = 40(3R - C_p(40\\,\\mathrm{K})) = 40(24.943388... - 7.68) \\approx 690.535514$.\nThe second part of the expression is then:\n$$(690.535514...) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{298} - \\frac{1}{40}\\right) \\approx -14.946924\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\nSo, the entropy change is:\n$$\\Delta S_{40 \\to 298} \\approx 50.093339 - 14.946924 = 35.146415\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\nThe total molar entropy at $298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is the sum of the contributions:\n$$S_m(298\\,\\mathrm{K}) = \\Delta S_{0 \\to 40} + \\Delta S_{40 \\to 298} \\approx 2.56 + 35.146415 = 37.706415\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\nThe problem requires an assessment of the uncertainty arising from the extrapolation of $C_p(T)$ below $T=1\\,\\mathrm{K}$. This uncertainty propagates from the value of $\\beta = (1.200 \\pm 0.006) \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-4}}$. The entropy contribution from this extrapolation region ($0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $1\\,\\mathrm{K}$) is $\\Delta S_{0 \\to 1} = \\int_{0}^{1} (\\beta T^3/T) dT = \\beta/3$. The uncertainty in the total entropy, $\\delta S_m$, is therefore:\n$$\\delta S_m = \\delta \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\delta\\beta}{3} = \\frac{0.006 \\times 10^{-4}}{3} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\nThis uncertainty affects the sixth decimal place of the final calculated entropy. Since the result must be rounded to four significant figures, this uncertainty is negligible and does not influence the final reported value.\nRounding the result $S_m(298\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 37.706415\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$ to four significant figures gives $37.71$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{37.71}$$", "id": "2960056"}]}
