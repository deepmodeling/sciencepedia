This is a fundamental and well-established principle in nuclear physics and chemistry. The problem is a standard, textbook derivation based on this principle. It is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is structured as a multi-part derivation and calculation. Each part follows logically from the previous.

All terms are standard within the field of chemical kinetics and nuclear physics.\n4.  **No Flaws Found:** The problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the invalidity checklist, such as being non-formalizable, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing each of the three tasks in sequence.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Radioactive Decay Law**\n\nThe fundamental postulate states that for a single nucleus, the probability of decay in an infinitesimal time interval $\\mathrm{d}t$ is $\\lambda\\,\\mathrm{d}t$. Since the nuclei are identical and decay independently, the expected number of decays in the interval $[t, t+\\mathrm{d}t)$ for a population of $N(t)$ nuclei is the product of the number of nuclei and the individual decay probability.\nLet $\\mathrm{d}N$ represent the change in the number of nuclei $N(t)$ during this interval. This change is equal to the negative of the number of nuclei that decayed.\n$$ \\mathrm{d}N = -(\\text{number of nuclei}) \\times (\\text{probability of decay per nucleus}) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{d}N = -N(t) \\cdot (\\lambda\\,\\mathrm{d}t) $$\nThis yields the first-order ordinary differential equation governing radioactive decay:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\lambda N(t) $$\nTo solve this equation, we separate the variables:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{N(t)} = -\\lambda\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial state (at time $t=0$, the number of nuclei is $N_{0}$) to a generic state (at time $t$, the number of nuclei is $N(t)$).\n$$ \\int_{N_{0}}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N'} \\mathrm{d}N' = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\lambda\\,\\mathrm{d}t' $$\nThe integration yields:\n$$ [\\ln(N')]_{N_{0}}^{N(t)} = [-\\lambda t']_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ \\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_{0}) = -\\lambda t - 0 $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) = -\\lambda t $$\nBy exponentiating both sides, we obtain the functional form of $N(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}} = \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\n$$ N(t) = N_{0} \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\nThis is the required functional form.\n\nThe fraction of nuclei remaining is, by definition, the ratio $\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}$. From the equation above, this is:\n$$ \\text{Fraction remaining} = \\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}} = \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\nThe fraction of nuclei that have decayed is the initial number minus the remaining number, all divided by the initial number.\n$$ \\text{Fraction decayed} = \\frac{N_{0} - N(t)}{N_{0}} = 1 - \\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\n\n**2. Relationship between Decay Constant and Half-Life**\n\nThe half-life, $T_{1/2}$, is defined as the time at which the number of nuclei has been reduced to half of its initial value.\n$$ N(T_{1/2}) = \\frac{N_{0}}{2} $$\nSubstituting this definition into the decay law $N(t) = N_{0} \\exp(-\\lambda t)$:\n$$ \\frac{N_{0}}{2} = N_{0} \\exp(-\\lambda T_{1/2}) $$\nDividing both sides by $N_{0}$ (which is non-zero) gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-\\lambda T_{1/2}) $$\nTo solve for $T_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(-\\lambda T_{1/2})) $$\n$$ -\\ln(2) = -\\lambda T_{1/2} $$\nThis gives the fundamental relationship between the decay constant $\\lambda$ and the half-life $T_{1/2}$:\n$$ \\lambda T_{1/2} = \\ln(2) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad T_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda} $$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Ratio of Decayed to Remaining Nuclei**\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio of the number of nuclei that have decayed to the number of nuclei that remain after a time $t = 4800$ years, for a nuclide with a half-life $T_{1/2} = 1600$ years.\n\nLet $N_{decayed}(t)$ be the number of nuclei that have decayed by time $t$, and $N_{remain}(t)$ be the number of nuclei that remain.\n$$ N_{remain}(t) = N(t) $$\n$$ N_{decayed}(t) = N_{0} - N(t) $$\nThe required ratio, $R$, is:\n$$ R = \\frac{N_{decayed}(t)}{N_{remain}(t)} = \\frac{N_{0} - N(t)}{N(t)} = \\frac{N_{0}}{N(t)} - 1 $$\nFrom Part 1, we know that $\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}} = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$, which implies $\\frac{N_{0}}{N(t)} = \\exp(\\lambda t)$.\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n$$ R = \\exp(\\lambda t) - 1 $$\nFrom Part 2, we have the relationship $\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $R$:\n$$ R = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} t\\right) - 1 = \\exp\\left(\\ln(2) \\cdot \\frac{t}{T_{1/2}}\\right) - 1 $$\nUsing the identity $\\exp(a \\ln b) = b^a$, this simplifies to a more elegant form:\n$$ R = 2^{t/T_{1/2}} - 1 $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $t = 4800$ years and $T_{1/2} = 1600$ years.\nThe exponent is the number of half-lives that have elapsed:\n$$ \\frac{t}{T_{1/2}} = \\frac{4800}{1600} = 3 $$\nSo, the number of elapsed half-lives is exactly $3$. Substituting this value into the expression for the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = 2^3 - 1 $$\n$$ R = 8 - 1 = 7 $$\nThe result is an exact integer. The ratio of decayed nuclei to remaining nuclei after $4800$ years is precisely $7$.\nThis means that for every nucleus that remains, $7$ have decayed. This is consistent, as the total fraction is $1+7=8$, and after $3$ half-lives, the remaining fraction is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}$.\nThe ratio is $\\frac{1-1/8}{1/8} = \\frac{7/8}{1/8} = 7$. The calculation is correct.\nThe final answer is a pure, dimensionless number, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7}\n$$", "id": "2953411"}, {"introduction": "With the decay law established, we can now apply it to a practical dating problem.

It is a standard, non-trivial exercise in applying the principles of radioactive kinetics and first-order error propagation. The solution will now proceed.\n\nThe number of parent atoms, $P$, at a time $t$ after crystallization is given by the first-order decay law:\n$$P(t) = P_{0} \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nwhere $P_0$ is the initial number of parent atoms at $t=0$.\nSince the crystal was a closed system and initially contained negligible radiogenic daughter isotopes, the number of daughter atoms, $D^{*}$, produced by time $t$ is equal to the number of parent atoms that have decayed:\n$$D^{*}(t) = P_{0} - P(t)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(t)$ yields:\n$$D^{*}(t) = P_{0} - P_{0} \\exp(-\\lambda t) = P_{0} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t))$$\nThe problem defines the measured ratio as $R = D^{*}/P$. We substitute the expressions for $D^{*}(t)$ and $P(t)$:\n$$R = \\frac{D^{*}(t)}{P(t)} = \\frac{P_{0} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t))}{P_{0} \\exp(-\\lambda t)}$$\nThe initial quantity $P_0$ cancels, leading to the fundamental age equation relating the measured ratio $R$ to the age $t$:\n$$R = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)}{\\exp(-\\lambda t)} = \\exp(\\lambda t) - 1$$\nWe must now solve this equation for the age $t$:\n$$R + 1 = \\exp(\\lambda t)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\\ln(R + 1) = \\lambda t$$\nIsolating $t$ yields the required expression for the age as a function of $R$ and $\\lambda$:\n$$t = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(R + 1)$$\nTo evaluate this expression numerically, we first find the decay constant $\\lambda$ from the half-life $T_{1/2}$.

For example, a curved or trended pattern in residuals would falsify the assumptions of a single age, common initial ratio, and/or a closed system.\n\n### Least-Squares Fit and Residual Analysis\nWe perform an ordinary least-squares fit of the line $y = a + bx$ to the $n=6$ data points.\nThe sums required are:\n$\\sum x_i = 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15$\n$\\sum y_i = 0.7050+0.7270+0.7530+0.7830+0.8170+0.8550 = 4.6400$\n$\\sum x_i^2 = 0+1+4+9+16+25 = 55$\n$\\sum x_i y_i = 1(0.7270)+2(0.7530)+3(0.7830)+4(0.8170)+5(0.8550) = 12.1250$\n\nThe slope $b$ and intercept $a$ are:\n$$ b = \\frac{n \\sum x_i y_i - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{n \\sum x_i^2 - (\\sum x_i)^2} = \\frac{6(12.1250) - (15)(4.6400)}{6(55) - (15)^2} = \\frac{72.75 - 69.6}{330 - 225} = \\frac{3.15}{105} = 0.03 $$\n$$ a = \\bar{y} - b \\bar{x} = \\frac{4.6400}{6} - (0.03)\\frac{15}{6} = \\frac{4.6400 - 0.45}{6} = \\frac{4.19}{6} \\approx 0.698333 $$\nThe best-fit line is $y = 0.698333 + 0.03x$.\n\nThe residuals $r_i = y_i - (a+bx_i)$ are:\n$r_1 = 0.7050 - (0.698333 + 0.03 \\times 0) = +0.006667$\n$r_2 = 0.7270 - (0.698333 + 0.03 \\times 1) = -0.001333$\n$r_3 = 0.7530 - (0.698333 + 0.03 \\times 2) = -0.005333$\n$r_4 = 0.7830 - (0.698333 + 0.03 \\times 3) = -0.005333$\n$r_5 = 0.8170 - (0.698333 + 0.03 \\times 4) = -0.001333$\n$r_6 = 0.8550 - (0.698333 + 0.03 \\times 5) = +0.006667$\n\nThe sum of squared residuals is $\\sum r_i^2 \\approx 2(0.006667^2) + 2(0.001333^2) + 2(0.005333^2) \\approx 1.4933 \\times 10^{-4}$.\nThe chi-squared statistic is $\\chi^2 = \\sum_i (r_i/\\sigma_y)^2 = \\frac{\\sum r_i^2}{\\sigma_y^2}$.\nWith $\\sigma_y = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$, $\\sigma_y^2 = 2.5 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{1.4933 \\times 10^{-4}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 597.3 $$\nThe degrees of freedom are $\\nu = n-2 = 6-2=4$.\nThe Mean Square of Weighted Deviates is $\\mathrm{MSWD} = \\chi^2/\\nu = 597.3/4 \\approx 149.3$.\nAn MSWD of $\\approx 1$ is expected for a good fit where scatter is consistent with analytical uncertainty. An MSWD value of $\\approx 149$ is extremely high and indicates that the linear model is a very poor fit to the data; the scatter is far greater than analytical uncertainty allows.\n\nNow, examine the structure of the residuals: they follow a distinct, symmetric, non-random pattern: $[+, -, -, -, -, +]$. Plotted against $x$, they form a U-shaped or parabolic curve, with large positive values at the endpoints ($x=0, 5$) and negative values in the middle. This systematic curvature is a strong indication that the linear isochron model is incorrect for this dataset.\n\n### Subset Analysis\nWe fit two separate lines to subsets of the data.\n**Subset 1: Points 1-3** $(x_i, y_i) = \\{(0, 0.7050), (1, 0.7270), (2, 0.7530)\\}$\n$b_1 = \\frac{3\\sum x_iy_i - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{3\\sum x_i^2 - (\\sum x_i)^2} = \\frac{3(2.2330) - (3)(2.1850)}{3(5) - (3)^2} = \\frac{6.699 - 6.555}{15 - 9} = \\frac{0.144}{6} = 0.024$\n$a_1 = \\bar{y}_1 - b_1\\bar{x}_1 = (2.1850/3) - 0.024(1) \\approx 0.72833 - 0.024 = 0.70433$\n\n**Subset 2: Points 4-6** $(x_i, y_i) = \\{(3, 0.7830), (4, 0.8170), (5, 0.8550)\\}$\n$b_2 = \\frac{3\\sum x_iy_i - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{3\\sum x_i^2 - (\\sum x_i)^2} = \\frac{3(9.8920) - (12)(2.4550)}{3(50) - (12)^2} = \\frac{29.676 - 29.460}{150 - 144} = \\frac{0.216}{6} = 0.036$\n$a_2 = \\bar{y}_2 - b_2\\bar{x}_2 = (2.4550/3) - 0.036(4) \\approx 0.81833 - 0.144 = 0.67433$\n\nThe slopes $b_1=0.024$ and $b_2=0.036$ are markedly different. The intercepts $a_1 \\approx 0.7043$ and $a_2 \\approx 0.6743$ are also different.\nFor a valid isochron, the subset slopes should agree within uncertainty. The age $t$ is calculated from the slope $b$ via $t = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(1+b)$.\n$t_1 = \\frac{1}{1.42 \\times 10^{-11}} \\ln(1+0.024) \\approx \\frac{0.02372}{1.42 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 1.67 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{yr}$ ($1.67$ Ga).\n$t_2 = \\frac{1}{1.42 \\times 10^{-11}} \\ln(1+0.036) \\approx \\frac{0.03538}{1.42 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 2.49 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{yr}$ ($2.49$ Ga).\nThe apparent ages are discordant, which is another definitive sign that the assumptions for a single isochron are violated.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The fit yields $\\mathrm{MSWD}\\approx 1$, the residuals are structureless and randomly scattered about zero, and the subset slopes map to mutually consistent ages within uncertainty; therefore the system behaves as a closed system and the isochron is valid.**\nThis statement is contradicted by every single calculation performed. The MSWD is $\\approx 149$, not $\\approx 1$. The residuals show a pronounced U-shaped pattern, not random scatter. The subset ages ($1.67$ Ga and $2.49$ Ga) are highly discordant.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. The fit yields $\\mathrm{MSWD}\\gg 1$, the residuals versus $x$ exhibit systematic curvature with small residuals near the mean $x$ and large residuals at both ends (a pronounced non-random U-shaped pattern), and the two subset slopes differ significantly, mapping to discordant apparent ages and inconsistent intercepts; these are hallmarks of open-system behavior or mixing rather than a single closed-system isochron.**\nThis statement aligns with my findings. The fit yields $\\mathrm{MSWD} \\approx 149 \\gg 1$. The residuals exhibit a systematic, non-random U-shaped curvature. The phrase \"small residuals near the mean $x$\" is a slight mischaracterization, as the residuals are actually large and negative near the mean, but the core observation of \"systematic curvature\" and a \"U-shaped pattern\" is correct. Most importantly, the two subset slopes and intercepts are significantly different, mapping to discordant ages. These collective observations are indeed classic indicators of a disturbed isotopic system or, often, the mixing of two distinct geological components. It is the best description among the options.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. The fit yields $\\mathrm{MSWD}\\gg 1$, but the residuals are consistent with random scatter about zero; the excessive $\\mathrm{MSWD}$ is best explained by underestimated analytical uncertainties and does not indicate open-system behavior.**\nThis statement correctly notes that MSWD $\\gg 1$. However, it falsely claims the residuals are random. The analysis clearly showed a systematic U-shaped pattern. A systematic pattern cannot be explained by underestimating random analytical uncertainties; it points to a failure of the model itself.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. The fit yields $\\mathrm{MSWD}\\gg 1$ due to a single obvious outlier; removing that one point makes $\\mathrm{MSWD}\\approx 1$, the residuals become random, and the subset ages agree, indicating a valid closed-system isochron after exclusion of one bad analysis.**\nThis is incorrect. The residuals show a symmetric pattern where multiple points deviate from the line in a coordinated manner (e.g., points $1$ and $6$ have equal and opposite deviations from the center of the curve). There is no single outlier responsible for the poor fit; rather, there is a systematic problem with the entire dataset relative to the linear model.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2953437"}]}
