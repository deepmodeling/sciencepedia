It describes a standard thermodynamic derivation and a common experimental procedure for determining a fundamental physical-chemical constant. All necessary data and procedural instructions are provided. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to derive the relationship between freezing-point depression and solute molality for an ideal dilute solution. The condition for solid-liquid equilibrium between a pure solid solvent (component A) and a liquid solution is the equality of the chemical potentials of the solvent in the two phases:\n$$ \\mu_A^*(s, T_f, p) = \\mu_A(l, T_f, p, x_A) $$\nwhere $\\mu_A^*(s, T_f, p)$ is the molar chemical potential of the pure solid solvent at the solution's freezing temperature $T_f$ and pressure $p$, and $\\mu_A(l, T_f, p, x_A)$ is the chemical potential of the solvent in the liquid solution with mole fraction $x_A$.\n\nFor an ideal solution, the chemical potential of the solvent is given by:\n$$ \\mu_A(l, T_f, p, x_A) = \\mu_A^*(l, T_f, p) + RT_f \\ln(x_A) $$\nwhere $\\mu_A^*(l, T_f, p)$ is the chemical potential of the pure liquid solvent. Substituting this into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$ \\mu_A^*(s, T_f, p) - \\mu_A^*(l, T_f, p) = RT_f \\ln(x_A) $$\nThe left side of this equation is the molar Gibbs energy of fusion of the pure solvent, $\\Delta_{\\text{fus}}G_{m,A}^* (T_f, p)$. Thus:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta_{\\text{fus}}G_{m,A}^*}{T_f} = R \\ln(x_A) $$\nWe apply the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, $(\\frac{\\partial (G/T)}{\\partial T})_p = -H/T^2$, to the molar Gibbs energy of fusion:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta_{\\text{fus}}G_{m,A}^*/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_p = -\\frac{\\Delta_{\\text{fus}}H_{m,A}^*}{T^2} $$\nwhere $\\Delta_{\\text{fus}}H_{m,A}^*$ is the molar enthalpy of fusion of the pure solvent. To find the effect of the solute, we integrate from the freezing point of the pure solvent, $T_f^*$, where $x_A=1$ and thus $\\ln(x_A)=0$, to the freezing point of the solution, $T_f$, with mole fraction $x_A$.\n$$ \\int_{\\ln(1)}^{\\ln(x_A)} d(R \\ln(x_A')) = \\int_{T_f^*}^{T_f} -\\frac{\\Delta_{\\text{fus}}H_{m,A}^*}{T^2} dT $$\nAssuming that $\\Delta_{\\text{fus}}H_{m,A}^*$ is constant over the small temperature range involved, we can perform the integration:\n$$ R \\ln(x_A) = -\\Delta_{\\text{fus}}H_{m,A}^* \\left[ -\\frac{1}{T} \\right]_{T_f^*}^{T_f} = \\Delta_{\\text{fus}}H_{m,A}^* \\left( \\frac{1}{T_f} - \\frac{1}{T_f^*} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta_{\\text{fus}}H_{m,A}^* (T_f^* - T_f)}{T_f T_f^*} $$\nFor a dilute solution, several approximations are valid. The freezing-point depression, $\\Delta T_f = T_f^* - T_f$, is small, so $T_f \\approx T_f^*$ and the denominator $T_f T_f^* \\approx (T_f^*)^2$. The mole fraction of the solute, $x_B$, is small, so $x_A = 1 - x_B$ and $\\ln(x_A) = \\ln(1 - x_B) \\approx -x_B$. Substituting these gives:\n$$ -R x_B \\approx \\frac{\\Delta_{\\text{fus}}H_{m,A}^* \\Delta T_f}{(T_f^*)^2} $$\n$$ \\Delta T_f \\approx \\frac{R(T_f^*)^2}{\\Delta_{\\text{fus}}H_{m,A}^*} x_B $$\nFor a dilute aqueous solution, the mole fraction of the solute $x_B = n_B/(n_A+n_B) \\approx n_B/n_A$. Molality $m$ is defined as $m=n_B/(\\text{mass of solvent in kg}) = n_B/(n_A M_A)$, where $M_A$ is the molar mass of the solvent in $\\mathrm{kg \\cdot mol^{-1}}$. Thus, $x_B \\approx m M_A$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\Delta T_f$:\n$$ \\Delta T_f \\approx \\left( \\frac{R(T_f^*)^2 M_A}{\\Delta_{\\text{fus}}H_{m,A}^*} \\right) m $$\nThis shows that $\\Delta T_f$ is proportional to the molality $m$. The constant of proportionality, $\\Lambda = \\frac{R(T_f^*)^2 M_A}{\\Delta_{\\text{fus}}H_{m,A}^*}$, is identified as the cryoscopic constant, $K_f$. Thus, $\\Delta T_f = K_f m$.\n\nNext, we process the experimental data. For each run, we fit the pre-nucleation time-temperature data to the linear model $T(t) = \\alpha - R t$ using least-squares regression. A systematic analysis of the provided data reveals that for all datasets, the linear model fits the points perfectly with parameters $\\alpha=0.100\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $R=0.020\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of thermodynamics and physical chemistry, specifically concerning colligative properties of ideal solutions. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and all data provided are physically realistic and consistent. The task is a standard, albeit detailed, application of chemical thermodynamics.\n\nThe first task is to derive the specified integral equation from the given fundamental principles.\n\nThe boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the external pressure, $p_{\\text{ext}}$. For a pure solvent, this condition is written as:\n$$\np^{\\ast}(T_b^0) = p_{\\text{ext}}\n$$\nwhere $p^{\\ast}(T)$ is the saturation vapor pressure of the pure solvent at temperature $T$, and $T_b^0$ is the pure solvent's boiling temperature.\n\nFor an ideal solution containing a nonvolatile solute, the partial pressure of the solvent vapor above the solution is given by Raoult's law:\n$$\np_{\\text{solv}}(T) = x_{\\text{solv}} \\, p^{\\ast}(T)\n$$\nwhere $x_{\\text{solv}}$ is the mole fraction of the solvent in the solution. The boiling condition for the solution is met when this partial pressure equals the external pressure:\n$$\np_{\\text{solv}}(T_b) = x_{\\text{solv}} \\, p^{\\ast}(T_b) = p_{\\text{ext}}\n$$\nHere, $T_b$ is the boiling temperature of the solution.\n\nBy equating the expressions for the external pressure, $p_{\\text{ext}}$, we establish a relationship between the two boiling points:\n$$\np^{\\ast}(T_b^0) = x_{\\text{solv}} \\, p^{\\ast}(T_b)\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\frac{p^{\\ast}(T_b)}{p^{\\ast}(T_b^0)} = \\frac{1}{x_{\\text{solv}}}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p^{\\ast}(T_b)}{p^{\\ast}(T_b^0)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{x_{\\text{solv}}}\\right) = -\\ln(x_{\\text{solv}})\n$$\nThe left side can be expressed as a definite integral. The relationship between vapor pressure and temperature is given by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which for an ideal gas vapor phase is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ln p^{\\ast}}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}(T)}{R T^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}(T)$ is the temperature-dependent molar enthalpy of vaporization and $R$ is the universal gas constant. Integrating this differential from the pure solvent boiling point $T_b^0$ to the solution boiling point $T_b$ gives:\n$$\n\\int_{p^{\\ast}(T_b^0)}^{p^{\\ast}(T_b)} d\\ln p^{\\ast} = \\int_{T_b^0}^{T_b} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}(T)}{R T^2} \\, dT\n$$\nThe left-hand side integral evaluates to $\\ln(p^{\\ast}(T_b)) - \\ln(p^{\\ast}(T_b^0))$, which is $\\ln(p^{\\ast}(T_b)/p^{\\ast}(T_b^0))$.

The number of moles of solvent in $1\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ is $n_{\\text{solv}} = 1000/M$. The effective number of moles of solute particles is $n_{\\text{solute,eff}} = i \\cdot m$. Thus,\n$$\nx_{\\text{solv}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{solv}}}{n_{\\text{solv}} + n_{\\text{solute,eff}}}\n$$\nThe temperature-dependent enthalpy of vaporization, $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}(T)$, is constructed using the given heat capacity polynomials. The difference in heat capacities between the gas and liquid phases is:\n$$\n\\Delta C_p(T) = C_{p,\\mathrm{gas}}(T) - C_{p,\\mathrm{liq}}(T) = (a_g - a_l) + (b_g - b_l)T + (c_g - c_l)T^2 = \\Delta a + \\Delta b T + \\Delta c T^2\n$$\nThe enthalpy of vaporization at temperature $T$ is then calculated relative to the reference temperature $T_{\\text{ref}} = T_b^0$:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}(T) = \\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}(T_b^0) + \\int_{T_b^0}^{T} \\Delta C_p(\\tau) \\, d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}(T) = \\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}(T_b^0) + \\Delta a (T - T_b^0) + \\frac{\\Delta b}{2}(T^2 - (T_b^0)^2) + \\frac{\\Delta c}{3}(T^3 - (T_b^0)^3)\n$$\nThe problem reduces to finding the root $T_b$ of the following equation:\n$$\nF(T_b) = \\left( \\int_{T_b^0}^{T_b} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}(T)}{R T^2} \\, dT \\right) + \\ln(x_{\\text{solv}}) = 0\n$$\nSince $x_{\\text{solv}}  1$, $\\ln(x_{\\text{solv}})$ is negative. The integrand is positive for all relevant temperatures, so the integral is a monotonically increasing function of $T_b$. A unique root $T_b  T_b^0$ is guaranteed to exist.\n\nThe numerical strategy is to implement a function for $F(T_b)$ where the integral is evaluated using numerical quadrature. A robust root-finding algorithm, such as the Brent-Dekker method, is then employed to find the value of $T_b$ that satisfies $F(T_b) = 0$.
