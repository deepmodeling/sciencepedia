This fixes the free zinc ion concentration:\n$$K_{sp} = [\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}][\\mathrm{OH}^-]^2$$\n$$[\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[\\mathrm{OH}^-]^2} = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{-17}}{(1.00 \\times 10^{-4})^2} = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{-17}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-8}} = 3.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$$\nNext, we calculate the numerical value of $K_f'$. First, we evaluate $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Y}^{4-}}$ at $pH = 10.00$. Let $D$ be the denominator of the $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Y}^{4-}}$ expression:\n$$D = 1 + \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-10}}{5.50 \\times 10^{-11}} + \\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^{-10})^2}{(6.92 \\times 10^{-7})(5.50 \\times 10^{-11})} + \\dots$$\n$$D \\approx 1 + 1.81818 + 2.6274 \\times 10^{-4} + \\text{negligible terms} \\approx 2.81844$$\n$$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Y}^{4-}} = \\frac{1}{D} \\approx \\frac{1}{2.81844} \\approx 0.35480$$\nThe formation constant $K_f$ is given by $\\log_{10} K_f = 16.50$, so $K_f = 10^{16.50} \\approx 3.1623 \\times 10^{16}$.\n$$K_f' = K_f \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Y}^{4-}} = (3.1623 \\times 10^{16})(0.35480) \\approx 1.1220 \\times 10^{16}$$\nNow we consider the mass balance for the ligand. The total analytical concentration of the ligand, $C_L$, is distributed between the uncomplexed forms ($L'$) and the complexed form ($[\\mathrm{ZnY}^{2-}]$):\n$$C_L = L' + [\\mathrm{ZnY}^{2-}]$$\nFrom the definition of $K_f'$, we have $[\\mathrm{ZnY}^{2-}] = K_f'[\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}]L'$. Substituting this into the mass balance:\n$$C_L = L' + K_f'[\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}]L' = L'(1 + K_f'[\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}])$$\nWe can solve for $L'$ and subsequently find $[\\mathrm{ZnY}^{2-}]$:\n$$L' = \\frac{C_L}{1 + K_f'[\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}]} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-3}}{1 + (1.1220 \\times 10^{16})(3.00 \\times 10^{-9})} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-3}}{1 + 3.366 \\times 10^7}$$\nSince $3.366 \\times 10^7 \\gg 1$, the $1$ in the denominator is negligible.\n$$L' \\approx \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-3}}{3.366 \\times 10^7} \\approx 2.9709 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$$\nThe concentration of the complex is:\n$$[\\mathrm{ZnY}^{2-}] = C_L - L' = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3} - 2.9709 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx 0.9999999703 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$$\nAs expected, the complexation is highly favorable, and nearly all the ligand is converted to the complex $\\mathrm{ZnY}^{2-}$.\nFinally, we calculate the molar solubility $s$:\n$$s = [\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}] + [\\mathrm{ZnY}^{2-}]$$\n$$s = 3.00 \\times 10^{-9} + 0.9999999703 \\times 10^{-3}$$\n$$s \\approx 0.00100000297\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$s = 1.000 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$$\nThe solubility is almost exactly equal to the analytical concentration of the chelating agent, which is a common outcome when the conditional formation constant is large and there is an excess of the solid phase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.000 \\times 10^{-3}}$$", "id": "2918962"}]}
