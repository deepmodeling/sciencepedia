The analysis will proceed from the fundamental principles of colligative properties.\n\nThe boiling-point elevation, $\\Delta T_b$, is a colligative property that depends on the total molality of solute particles in a solution. For an electrolyte that dissociates into multiple ions, the effective molality is the product of the stoichiometric molality, $m$, and the van't Hoff factor, $i$. The relationship is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta T_b = i \\cdot K_b \\cdot m\n$$\nwhere $K_b$ is the ebullioscopic constant of the solvent.\n\nFirst, we must validate the given units. The boiling-point elevation is given as $\\Delta T_b = 0.384\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. A temperature difference in degrees Celsius is numerically identical to a temperature difference in Kelvin, so we can state $\\Delta T_b = 0.384\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The ebullioscopic constant for water is $K_b = 0.512\\,\\mathrm{K\\,kg\\,mol^{-1}}$, and the solute molality is $m = 0.300\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$. All units are consistent within the SI system.\n\nTo determine the van't Hoff factor, $i$, we rearrange the boiling-point elevation equation:\n$$\ni = \\frac{\\Delta T_b}{K_b \\cdot m}\n$$\nSubstituting the provided numerical values:\n$$\ni = \\frac{0.384\\,\\mathrm{K}}{(0.512\\,\\mathrm{K\\,kg\\,mol^{-1}}) \\cdot (0.300\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}})}\n$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\ni = \\frac{0.384}{0.1536} = 2.50\n$$\nThe problem requests the value of $i$ to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $2.50$, which satisfies this requirement.\n\nNext, we must infer the most likely integer value for $\\nu$, the number of ions produced per formula unit of the solute upon dissociation. The van't Hoff factor is related to $\\nu$ and the degree of dissociation, $\\alpha$, by the following expression:\n$$\ni = 1 + \\alpha(\\nu - 1)\n$$\nThe degree of dissociation, $\\alpha$, is constrained to the interval $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$. From this constraint, we can derive a fundamental relationship between $i$ and $\\nu$:\nSince $\\alpha \\ge 0$, it follows that $i = 1 + \\alpha(\\nu - 1) \\ge 1 + 0(\\nu - 1) = 1$.\nSince $\\alpha \\le 1$, it follows that $i = 1 + \\alpha(\\nu - 1) \\le 1 + 1(\\nu - 1) = \\nu$.\nThus, the van't Hoff factor must satisfy the condition $1 \\le i \\le \\nu$.\n\nGiven our calculated value $i = 2.50$, we must have $\\nu \\ge 2.50$. Since $\\nu$ must be an integer representing the number of discrete ions, the smallest possible integer value for $\\nu$ is $3$.\n\nLet us examine the possible integer values for $\\nu$ and the corresponding degree of dissociation, $\\alpha$, required to produce $i = 2.50$.\nRearranging the formula for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{i - 1}{\\nu - 1}\n$$\nWe test plausible integer values for $\\nu \\ge 2$ (since it is an electrolyte).\n\nCase $1$: $\\nu = 2$.\nThis would correspond to a solute that dissociates into $2$ ions (e.g., NaCl). The theoretical range for $i$ would be $1 \\le i \\le 2$. Our experimental value of $i = 2.50$ falls outside this range. Therefore, $\\nu$ cannot be $2$.\n\nCase $2$: $\\nu = 3$.\nThis corresponds to a solute dissociating into $3$ ions (e.g., $\\mathrm{CaCl}_2$ or $\\mathrm{Na}_2\\mathrm{SO}_4$). The theoretical range for $i$ is $1 \\le i \\le 3$. Our value $i = 2.50$ is within this range. Let us calculate the corresponding degree of dissociation:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{2.50 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\frac{1.50}{2} = 0.75\n$$\nA degree of dissociation of $\\alpha = 0.75$, or $75\\%$, is a high value, which is consistent with the characterization of the solute as a \"strong electrolyte.\" The deviation from complete dissociation ($\\alpha=1$) is expected in non-ideal solutions due to inter-ionic attractions (ion pairing).\n\nCase $3$: $\\nu = 4$.\nThis corresponds to a solute dissociating into $4$ ions (e.g., $\\mathrm{FeCl}_3$). The theoretical range for $i$ is $1 \\le i \\le 4$. Our value $i = 2.50$ is within this range. The required degree of dissociation would be:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{2.50 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\frac{1.50}{3} = 0.50\n$$\nA degree of dissociation of $\\alpha = 0.50$, or $50\\%$, is significantly lower and less characteristic of a \"strong\" electrolyte, which by definition dissociates almost completely.\n\nCase $4$: $\\nu = 5$.\nThis corresponds to a solute dissociating into $5$ ions (e.g., $\\mathrm{Al}_2(\\mathrm{SO}_4)_3$). The required degree of dissociation would be:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{2.50 - 1}{5 - 1} = \\frac{1.50}{4} = 0.375\n$$\nThis value of $\\alpha$ is even lower and less plausible for a substance described as a strong electrolyte.\n\nBased on this analysis, the value $\\nu=3$ yields a degree of dissociation $\\alpha=0.75$, which is the most physically plausible scenario for a strong electrolyte under the given conditions. Higher values of $\\nu$ would imply progressively weaker dissociation, contradicting the problem statement. Therefore, the most likely integer value for $\\nu$ is $3$.\n\nThe final results are the van't Hoff factor $i = 2.50$ and the stoichiometric ion count $\\nu = 3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.50  3 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2963516"}, {"introduction": "While experimental data provides the value of the van't Hoff factor, theoretical models are essential for predicting and understanding the microscopic origins of non-ideality.
