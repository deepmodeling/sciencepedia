First, a rigorous justification of the freezing point depression equation from fundamental thermodynamic principles is demanded. Second, this established relationship must be applied to a specific case of a dimerization equilibrium to quantify the extent of association. We will address these tasks in sequence.\n\nThe first principle governing phase equilibrium is the equality of the chemical potential of a component across all phases in which it is present. For the freezing of a solution, where pure solid solvent is in equilibrium with the liquid solution at the freezing temperature $T_f$, this condition is expressed for the solvent as:\n$$\n\\mu_{solv, l}(T_f, P, x_{solv}) = \\mu_{solv, s}^*(T_f, P)\n$$\nHere, $\\mu_{solv, l}$ is the chemical potential of the solvent in the liquid solution, and $\\mu_{solv, s}^*$ is the chemical potential of the pure solid solvent. The asterisk denotes a pure substance.\n\nFor an ideal solution, the chemical potential of the solvent is related to that of the pure liquid solvent, $\\mu_{solv, l}^*$, and its mole fraction, $x_{solv}$, by:\n$$\n\\mu_{solv, l}(T_f, P, x_{solv}) = \\mu_{solv, l}^*(T_f, P) + RT_f \\ln(x_{solv})\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant. Substituting this into the equilibrium condition yields:\n$$\n\\mu_{solv, l}^*(T_f, P) + RT_f \\ln(x_{solv}) = \\mu_{solv, s}^*(T_f, P)\n$$\nRearranging separates the terms related to the pure solvent and the solution composition:\n$$\n\\ln(x_{solv}) = \\frac{\\mu_{solv, s}^*(T_f, P) - \\mu_{solv, l}^*(T_f, P)}{RT_f}\n$$\nThe numerator is the negative of the molar Gibbs free energy of fusion of the pure solvent at temperature $T_f$, $\\Delta G_{fus}^*(T_f)$. Thus:\n$$\n\\ln(x_{solv}) = -\\frac{\\Delta G_{fus}^*(T_f)}{RT_f}\n$$\nTo understand the temperature dependence, we invoke the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, $\\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta G/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = -\\frac{\\Delta H}{T^2}$. Integrating this for the process of fusion from the normal freezing point of the pure solvent, $T_f^*$, to the solution's freezing point, $T_f$, we have:\n$$\n\\int_{T_f^*}^{T_f} d\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{fus}^*}{T}\\right) = \\int_{T_f^*}^{T_f} -\\frac{\\Delta H_{fus}^*}{T^2} dT\n$$\nAssuming the molar enthalpy of fusion, $\\Delta H_{fus}^*$, is constant over this small temperature range:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta G_{fus}^*(T_f)}{T_f} - \\frac{\\Delta G_{fus}^*(T_f^*)}{T_f^*} = \\Delta H_{fus}^* \\left(\\frac{1}{T_f} - \\frac{1}{T_f^*}\\right)\n$$\nAt $T_f^*$, the pure liquid and solid are in equilibrium, so $\\Delta G_{fus}^*(T_f^*) = 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta G_{fus}^*(T_f)}{T_f} = \\Delta H_{fus}^* \\left(\\frac{T_f^* - T_f}{T_f T_f^*}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta H_{fus}^* \\Delta T_f}{T_f T_f^*}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta T_f = T_f^* - T_f$ is the freezing point depression. Substituting this back into the equation for $\\ln(x_{solv})$:\n$$\n\\ln(x_{solv}) = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{fus}^* \\Delta T_f}{R T_f T_f^*}\n$$\nFor a dilute solution, two approximations are valid. First, the mole fraction of the solvent $x_{solv} = 1 - x_{solute}$, where $x_{solute}$ is the total mole fraction of all solute species. For $x_{solute} \\ll 1$, we can approximate $\\ln(1 - x_{solute}) \\approx -x_{solute}$. Second, for a small depression, $T_f \\approx T_f^*$, so $T_f T_f^* \\approx (T_f^*)^2$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n-x_{solute} \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta H_{fus}^* \\Delta T_f}{R (T_f^*)^2} \\implies \\Delta T_f \\approx \\left(\\frac{R(T_f^*)^2}{\\Delta H_{fus}^*}\\right) x_{solute}\n$$\nFinally, we relate the mole fraction $x_{solute}$ to the total molality of solute particles, $b_{total}$. For a dilute solution, $x_{solute} = \\frac{n_{total}}{n_{solv} + n_{total}} \\approx \\frac{n_{total}}{n_{solv}}$. The molality is $b_{total} = \\frac{n_{total}}{m_{solv, kg}}$ and the moles of solvent are $n_{solv} = \\frac{m_{solv, kg}}{M_{solv}}$, where $M_{solv}$ is the molar mass of the solvent in kg mol$^{-1}$. Thus, $x_{solute} \\approx b_{total} M_{solv}$. Substitution gives:\n$$\n\\Delta T_f \\approx \\left(\\frac{R(T_f^*)^2 M_{solv}}{\\Delta H_{fus}^*}\\right) b_{total}\n$$\nThe term in parentheses is defined as the cryoscopic constant, $K_f$. This completes the justification for the direct proportionality between freezing point depression and the total molality of independent solute particles: $\\Delta T_f = K_f b_{total}$.\n\nNow, we apply this to the problem. The initial mass of solute $A$ is $m_A = 1.000$ g, with monomer molar mass $M_A = 200.00$ g mol$^{-1}$. The initial moles of $A$ monomer units are:\n$$\nn_{A, initial} = \\frac{m_A}{M_A} = \\frac{1.000 \\text{ g}}{200.00 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}} = 0.005000 \\text{ mol}\n$$\nThis is dissolved in $m_{solv} = 100.00$ g, or $0.10000$ kg, of benzene. The stoichiometric molality, if no reaction occurred, would be:\n$$\nb_{initial} = \\frac{n_{A, initial}}{m_{solv, kg}} = \\frac{0.005000 \\text{ mol}}{0.10000 \\text{ kg}} = 0.05000 \\text{ mol kg}^{-1}\n$$\nThe reversible dimerization is $2A \\rightleftharpoons A_{2}$. Let $\\alpha$ be the fraction of initial monomer units that are present as dimers. At equilibrium, the number of moles of dimer $A_2$ is $n_{A_2} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} n_{A, initial}$. The number of moles of remaining monomer $A$ is $n_A = n_{A, initial}(1-\\alpha)$.\nThe total moles of solute particles at equilibrium is the sum:\n$$\nn_{total} = n_A + n_{A_2} = n_{A, initial}(1-\\alpha) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2} n_{A, initial} = n_{A, initial}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe effective molality of all solute species at equilibrium, $b_{total}$, is therefore:\n$$\nb_{total} = \\frac{n_{total}}{m_{solv, kg}} = \\frac{n_{A, initial}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)}{m_{solv, kg}} = b_{initial}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem provides the measured freezing point depression, $\\Delta T_f = 0.1920$ K, and the cryoscopic constant for benzene, $K_f = 5.12$ K kg mol$^{-1}$. From our derived relation, we can find the effective molality:\n$$\nb_{total} = \\frac{\\Delta T_f}{K_f} = \\frac{0.1920 \\text{ K}}{5.12 \\text{ K kg mol}^{-1}} = 0.0375 \\text{ mol kg}^{-1}\n$$\nWe now equate the two expressions for $b_{total}$:\n$$\n0.0375 \\text{ mol kg}^{-1} = b_{initial}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) = 0.05000 \\text{ mol kg}^{-1} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for the term containing $\\alpha$:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = \\frac{0.0375}{0.05000} = 0.75\n$$\nThis yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{2} = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = 2 \\times 0.25 = 0.5\n$$\nThe fraction of monomer units that have dimerized is $0.5$.
