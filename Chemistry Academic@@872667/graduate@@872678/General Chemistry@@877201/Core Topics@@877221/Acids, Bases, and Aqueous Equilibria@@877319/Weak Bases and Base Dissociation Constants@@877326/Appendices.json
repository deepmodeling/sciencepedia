I will now proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe analysis of the chemical system at equilibrium is governed by four fundamental relationships.\n$1$. The definition of the base dissociation constant, $K_b$:\n$$K_{b} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}][\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]}$$\n$2$. The definition of the ionic product of water, $K_w$:\n$$K_{w} = [\\mathrm{H^{+}}][\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$$\n$3$. The mass balance for the pyridine species, which states that the total concentration of pyridine in its protonated and unprotonated forms must equal the initial formal concentration $C$:\n$$C = [\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]$$\n$4$. The charge balance, or electroneutrality condition, which requires that the total concentration of positive charge equals the total concentration of negative charge:\n$$[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] + [\\mathrm{H^{+}}] = [\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$$\nThe system consists of these four equations and four unknown concentrations: $[\\mathrm{B}]$, $[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]$, $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$, and $[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$. Our objective is to find $\\alpha = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]}{C}$.\n\nWe will manipulate these equations to derive a single equation for $\\alpha$.\nFrom the definition of $\\alpha$, we have $[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] = \\alpha C$.\nFrom the mass balance, we express $[\\mathrm{B}]$ as $[\\mathrm{B}] = C - [\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] = C - \\alpha C = C(1-\\alpha)$.\nNow we express $[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$ and $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$ in terms of $\\alpha$.\nFrom the expression for $K_b$:\n$$[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}] = K_b \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]} = K_b \\frac{C(1-\\alpha)}{\\alpha C} = K_b \\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}$$\nFrom the expression for $K_w$:\n$$[\\mathrm{H^{+}}] = \\frac{K_w}{[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]} = \\frac{K_w}{K_b \\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}} = \\frac{K_w \\alpha}{K_b(1-\\alpha)}$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]$, $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$, and $[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$ into the charge balance equation:\n$$[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] + [\\mathrm{H^{+}}] = [\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$$\n$$\\alpha C + \\frac{K_w \\alpha}{K_b(1-\\alpha)} = K_b \\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}$$\nThis is an exact governing equation for the fraction of protonated base, $\\alpha$. To solve for $\\alpha$, we must first assess the magnitude of the terms. Since pyridine is a weak base ($K_b = 1.7 \\times 10^{-9}$ is very small), the extent of protonation will be small, so $\\alpha \\ll 1$. Furthermore, the solution will be basic, meaning $[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}] \\gg [\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$. The charge balance equation $[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] + [\\mathrm{H^{+}}] = [\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$ can therefore be rigorously approximated by neglecting the $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$ term, which is equivalent to dropping the second term in our derived equation for $\\alpha$. This approximation is justified because $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$ is expected to be many orders of magnitude smaller than $[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]$.\nThus, we arrive at the simplified charge balance $[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] \\approx [\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$.\nUsing this approximation, we have:\n$[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] = \\alpha C$\n$[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}] \\approx \\alpha C$\n$[\\mathrm{B}] = C(1 - \\alpha)$\nSubstituting these into the $K_b$ expression gives:\n$$K_b = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}][\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]} \\approx \\frac{(\\alpha C)(\\alpha C)}{C(1-\\alpha)} = \\frac{\\alpha^2 C}{1-\\alpha}$$\nThis provides a quadratic equation for $\\alpha$:\n$$K_b (1-\\alpha) = \\alpha^2 C$$\n$$C \\alpha^2 + K_b \\alpha - K_b = 0$$\nThis is the standard quadratic form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ with $x=\\alpha$, $a=C$, $b=K_b$, and $c=-K_b$. The physical solution for $\\alpha$ must be positive, given by:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-K_b + \\sqrt{K_b^2 - 4(C)(-K_b)}}{2C} = \\frac{-K_b + \\sqrt{K_b^2 + 4CK_b}}{2C}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $C = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$ and $K_b = 1.7 \\times 10^{-9}$.\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{-(1.7 \\times 10^{-9}) + \\sqrt{(1.7 \\times 10^{-9})^2 + 4(0.020)(1.7 \\times 10^{-9})}}{2(0.020)}$$\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{-1.7 \\times 10^{-9} + \\sqrt{2.89 \\times 10^{-18} + 1.36 \\times 10^{-10}}}{0.040}$$\nThe term $K_b^2$ is negligible compared to $4CK_b$.\n$$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{-1.7 \\times 10^{-9} + \\sqrt{1.36 \\times 10^{-10}}}{0.040}$$\n$$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{-1.7 \\times 10^{-9} + 1.16619 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.040}$$\n$$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1.16602 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.040} \\approx 2.91505 \\times 10^{-4}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the numerical value for $\\alpha$ is $0.0002915$.\n\nNow, for the second part of the problem, we must explain the correlation between the small value of $\\alpha$ and the low extent of $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$ generation using the derived relationships.\nThe fundamental equations provide the necessary framework. The charge balance equation is $[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}] = [\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] + [\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$. The extent of $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$ generation is the net increase in $[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$ above its concentration in pure water. The total $[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$ at equilibrium is the most direct measure of this effect.\nOur derivation showed that the approximation $[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] \\approx [\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$ is highly accurate for this system. Let us verify this explicitly.\nUsing our calculated $\\alpha = 2.915 \\times 10^{-4}$:\n$$[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] = \\alpha C = (2.915 \\times 10^{-4})(0.020) = 5.830 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$$\nFrom $[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] \\approx [\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$, we have $[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}] \\approx 5.830 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.\nWe can then find $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$ from $K_w$:\n$$[\\mathrm{H^{+}}] = \\frac{K_w}{[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]} \\approx \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}}{5.830 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 1.715 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$$\nComparing $[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]$ and $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$, we see that $5.830 \\times 10^{-6} \\gg 1.715 \\times 10^{-9}$, which confirms that neglecting $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$ in the charge balance was a valid simplification.\nTherefore, the relationship $[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}] \\approx [\\mathrm{BH^{+}}]$ is justified.\nBy substituting the definition of $\\alpha$, $[\\mathrm{BH^{+}}] = \\alpha C$, into this approximate charge balance, we obtain the direct correlation:\n$$[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}] \\approx \\alpha C$$\nThis equation, derived from first principles, demonstrates that the concentration of hydroxide ions produced is directly proportional to the fraction of protonated base, $\\alpha$. The constant of proportionality is the formal concentration $C$. Since the calculated value of $\\alpha$ is very small ($\\alpha = 2.915 \\times 10^{-4}$), it follows directly that the equilibrium concentration of $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$ generated by the base is also small relative to the total base concentration. Specifically, $[\\mathrm{OH^{-}}] \\approx (2.915 \\times 10^{-4})(0.020) = 5.83 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$. This value is significantly less than $C = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$, indicating a low extent of reaction, which is a direct consequence of the small magnitude of the fractional protonation, $\\alpha$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0002915}$$", "id": "2964219"}, {"introduction": "Approximations are powerful tools in chemistry, but a true expert understands their limitations.

The problem is not trivial, incomplete, or contradictory. It is a standard, yet important, scenario in analytical chemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Model\n\nTo describe the equilibrium state of the weak base $\\mathrm{B}$ in water, we must account for all relevant species and the equilibria that connect them. The species in solution are the solvent $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, the undissociated base $\\mathrm{B}$, its conjugate acid $\\mathrm{BH}^+$, the hydrogen ion $\\mathrm{H}^+$, and the hydroxide ion $\\mathrm{OH}^-$. This gives us four unknown concentrations to determine: $[\\mathrm{B}]$, $[\\mathrm{BH}^+]$, $[\\mathrm{H}^+]$, and $[\\mathrm{OH}^-]$. According to the fundamental principles of algebra, we require four independent equations to solve for these four unknowns.\n\nThe required equations are derived from the principles stipulated in the problem statement:\n\n1.  **Law of Mass Action for Base Dissociation:** The equilibrium for the reaction $\\mathrm{B} + \\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{BH}^+ + \\mathrm{OH}^-$ is governed by the base dissociation constant $K_b$.\n    $$K_b = \\frac{[\\mathrm{BH}^+][\\mathrm{OH}^-]}{[\\mathrm{B}]}$$\n\n2.  **Law of Mass Action for Water Autoionization:** The self-ionization of water, $\\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}^+ + \\mathrm{OH}^-$, provides a relationship between the hydrogen and hydroxide ion concentrations, governed by the ionic product of water, $K_w$.\n    $$K_w = [\\mathrm{H}^+][\\mathrm{OH}^-]$$\n    This equation inherently includes the contribution of water to the ion concentrations.\n\n3.  **Elemental Mass Balance:** The total amount of the base species (protonated and unprotonated) must be conserved and equal to the initial formal concentration, $C_b$.\n    $$C_b = [\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH}^+]$$\n\n4.  **Principle of Electroneutrality (Charge Balance):** The solution as a whole must be electrically neutral. The sum of the molar concentrations of positive charges must equal the sum of the molar concentrations of negative charges. The cations are $\\mathrm{H}^+$ and $\\mathrm{BH}^+$. The only anion is $\\mathrm{OH}^-$.\n    $$[\\mathrm{H}^+] + [\\mathrm{BH}^+] = [\\mathrm{OH}^-]$$\n\nThis set of four equations is complete and necessary to solve the system without any simplifying assumptions.\n\nNext, we must address whether the self-ionization of water can be neglected. This is equivalent to asking if we can simplify the system. A common simplification is to assume that the concentration of hydroxide ions contributed by the base is much greater than that from water, which implies $[\\mathrm{H}^+]$ is negligible in the charge balance equation. This reduces the charge balance to $[\\mathrm{BH}^+] \\approx [\\mathrm{OH}^-]$. Let us test this assumption.\n\nIf we were to neglect water's contribution, the expected hydroxide concentration, $[\\mathrm{OH}^-]_{\\text{base}}$, would be generated solely from base dissociation. Given $C_b = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M}$, the maximum possible $[\\mathrm{OH}^-]$ from the base is $1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M}$ (if the base were strong and dissociated completely). In pure water at $25 \\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the concentration of hydroxide ions from autoionization is $[\\mathrm{OH}^-]_{\\text{water}} = \\sqrt{K_w} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n\nSince the concentration of the base itself is $1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M}$, the hydroxide concentration it can produce, $[\\mathrm{OH}^-]_{\\text{base}}$, is guaranteed to be in the same order of magnitude as, or even less than, the hydroxide concentration from water, $[\\mathrm{OH}^-]_{\\text{water}}$. Therefore, the contribution from water's self-ionization is not negligible; it is, in fact, comparable to the contribution from the base. The simplification is invalid. The full system of four equations must be solved.\n\nThe justification for including the self-ionization of water is precisely that the expected concentration of hydroxide ions is comparable to the concentration of hydroxide ions in pure water.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The self-ionization of water must be included because the expected hydroxide concentration is comparable to that from pure water; the unknowns are $ [\\mathrm{H}^+] $, $ [\\mathrm{OH}^-] $, $ [\\mathrm{BH}^+] $, and $ [\\mathrm{B}] $, with equations:**\n- **Justification:** \"The expected hydroxide concentration is comparable to that from pure water.\" This is correct, as established in my analysis.\n- **Equations:** The four equations provided are:\n  -   $C_b = [\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH}^+]$ (Correct mass balance)\n  -   $K_b = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{BH}^+][\\mathrm{OH}^-]}{[\\mathrm{B}]}$ (Correct base equilibrium)\n  -   $K_w = [\\mathrm{H}^+][\\mathrm{OH}^-]$ (Correct water equilibrium)\n  -   $[\\mathrm{H}^+] + [\\mathrm{BH}^+] = [\\mathrm{OH}^-]$ (Correct charge balance)\nThis option provides the correct justification and the correct, complete set of equations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.

The justification \"so only the base generates hydroxide\" is a scientifically incorrect statement; water always contributes to the $[\\mathrm{OH}^-]$ pool. The resulting simplified equation $[\\mathrm{BH}^+] = [\\mathrm{OH}^-]$ is invalid under these conditions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The self-ionization of water must be included, but the charge balance is $ [\\mathrm{H}^+] = [\\mathrm{OH}^-] + [\\mathrm{BH}^+] $; ...**\nThis option correctly states that self-ionization must be included. However, it presents an incorrect charge balance equation. The correct equation sums the concentrations of positive species ($\\mathrm{H}^+$, $\\mathrm{BH}^+$) and equates them to the sum of concentrations of negative species ($\\mathrm{OH}^-$). The proposed equation is physically meaningless.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The self-ionization of water is unnecessary because $ K_b \\gg K_w/C_b $, so water’s contribution is negligible; ... No charge balance is needed because neutrality is enforced by $ [\\mathrm{BH}^+] = [\\mathrm{OH}^-] $.**\nThe justification involving the condition $K_b \\gg K_w/C_b$ (here, $10^{-5} \\gg 10^{-7}$) is a rule of thumb that is misleading in this borderline case; a more rigorous analysis proves the opposite conclusion. More gravely, the claim that \"No charge balance is needed\" is a flagrant violation of fundamental chemical principles.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The self-ionization of water must be included, but the base equilibrium is $ K_b = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{OH}^-]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^+]} $; ...**\nThis option correctly states that self-ionization must be included and provides the correct charge balance equation. However, the expression for the base dissociation constant $K_b$ is inverted. The products of dissociation, $\\mathrm{BH}^+$ and $\\mathrm{OH}^-$, must be in the numerator.

Substituting this into the mass balance gives $C_{A} = \\frac{h[A^{-}]}{K_{a}} + [A^{-}] = [A^{-}] \\left( \\frac{h}{K_{a}} + 1 \\right) = [A^{-}] \\frac{h+K_{a}}{K_{a}}$.\n  Solving for $[A^{-}]$ yields:\n  $$[A^{-}] = C_{A} \\frac{K_{a}}{h+K_{a}}$$\n- To find $[BH^{+}]$, we use the mass balance for the base: $C_{B} = [B] + [BH^{+}]$. From the $K_{b}$ expression, we have $[B] = \\frac{[BH^{+}][OH^{-}]}{K_{b}}$. Substituting $[OH^{-}] = K_{w}/h$, we get $[B] = \\frac{[BH^{+}] K_{w}}{h K_{b}}$. Substituting this into the mass balance gives $C_{B} = \\frac{[BH^{+}] K_{w}}{h K_{b}} + [BH^{+}] = [BH^{+}] \\left( \\frac{K_{w}}{h K_{b}} + 1 \\right) = [BH^{+}] \\frac{K_{w} + h K_{b}}{h K_{b}}$.\n  Solving for $[BH^{+}]$ yields:\n  $$[BH^{+}] = C_{B} \\frac{h K_{b}}{h K_{b} + K_{w}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $[OH^{-}]$, $[A^{-}]$, and $[BH^{+}]$ into the charge balance equation:\n$$h + C_{B} \\frac{h K_{b}}{h K_{b} + K_{w}} = \\frac{K_{w}}{h} + C_{A} \\frac{K_{a}}{h+K_{a}}$$\nThis is the required single scalar equation for $h = [H^{+}]$, containing only the variable $h$ and the given constants $C_{A}$, $C_{B}$, $K_{a}$, $K_{b}$, and $K_{w}$.\n\nTo find the pH, we must solve this equation for $h$. This equation is equivalent to a quartic polynomial in $h$ and is not readily solved by analytical means. We will solve it numerically by finding the root of the function $f(h) = 0$, where:\n$$f(h) = h + C_{B} \\frac{h K_{b}}{h K_{b} + K_{w}} - \\frac{K_{w}}{h} - C_{A} \\frac{K_{a}}{h+K_{a}}$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- $C_{A} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n- $C_{B} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n- $K_{a} = 3.20 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- $K_{b} = 4.00 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- $K_{w} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-14}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the function $f(h)$:\n$$f(h) = h + (1.20 \\times 10^{-2}) \\frac{h (4.00 \\times 10^{-6})}{h (4.00 \\times 10^{-6}) + 1.00 \\times 10^{-14}} - \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-14}}{h} - (1.00 \\times 10^{-2}) \\frac{3.20 \\times 10^{-6}}{h+3.20 \\times 10^{-6}}$$\nUsing an iterative numerical method (such as the Newton-Raphson method or a bisection method) we find the physically meaningful positive root for $h$. Numerical solution of $f(h)=0$ yields:\n$$h = [H^{+}] \\approx 1.2229 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\n\nThe power of hydrogen, $\\mathrm{pH}$, is defined as $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}[H^{+}]$.\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}(1.2229 \\times 10^{-8})$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = -(\\log_{10}(1.2229) + \\log_{10}(10^{-8}))$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = 8 - \\log_{10}(1.2229)$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 8 - 0.08739 = 7.91261$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $7.91261...$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $7.913$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.913}$$", "id": "2964174"}]}
