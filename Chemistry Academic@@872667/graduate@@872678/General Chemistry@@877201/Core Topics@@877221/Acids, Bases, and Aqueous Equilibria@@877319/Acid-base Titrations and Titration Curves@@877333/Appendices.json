The initial concentrations of both the acid and the base are unusually low, $1.0\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$, necessitating a rigorous treatment that accounts for the self-ionization of water.\n\nThe solution is governed by three fundamental principles as specified: stoichiometry, electroneutrality, and chemical equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we apply the principle of stoichiometry for the neutralization reaction $\\mathrm{H^{+}} + \\mathrm{OH^{-}} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H_{2}O}$. At the equivalence point, the number of moles of acid, $n_a$, equals the number of moles of base added, $n_b$.\nThe initial moles of acid are given by $n_{a} = C_{a}V_{a}$, where $C_{a} = 1.0\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ is the initial concentration of $\\mathrm{HCl}$ and $V_{a} = 50.00\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ is its volume. Since $\\mathrm{HCl}$ is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so the initial moles of $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ are both equal to $n_a$.\nThe moles of base added are $n_{b} = C_{b}V_{b}$, where $C_{b} = 1.0\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ is the concentration of $\\mathrm{NaOH}$ and $V_{b}$ is the volume added. Since $\\mathrm{NaOH}$ is a strong base, the moles of $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ and $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$ added are equal to $n_b$.\n\nAt the equivalence point, $n_{a} = n_{b}$.\n$$C_{a}V_{a} = C_{b}V_{b}$$\nGiven that $C_{a} = C_{b}$, it follows that $V_{a} = V_{b}$. Thus, the volume of $\\mathrm{NaOH}$ solution added is $V_{b} = 50.00\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\nThe total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is $V_{total} = V_{a} + V_{b} = 50.00\\,\\mathrm{mL} + 50.00\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 100.00\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nThe spectator ions, $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ and $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$, do not participate in the neutralization. Their concentrations in the final solution are:\n$$[\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}] = \\frac{n_{a}}{V_{total}} = \\frac{C_{a}V_{a}}{V_{a} + V_{b}}$$\n$$[\\mathrm{Na^{+}}] = \\frac{n_{b}}{V_{total}} = \\frac{C_{b}V_{b}}{V_{a} + V_{b}}$$\nSince we have established that $n_{a} = n_{b}$ at the equivalence point, it is a direct consequence that $[\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}] = [\\mathrm{Na^{+}}]$. This is a general result for the equivalence point of any titration between a monoprotic strong acid and a monohydroxic strong base.\n\nSecond, we apply the principle of electroneutrality (charge balance). The total concentration of positive charges must equal the total concentration of negative charges. The ionic species present in the solution are $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$, $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$, $\\mathrm{Na^{+}}$, and $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$. The charge balance equation is:\n$$[\\mathrm{H^{+}}] + [\\mathrm{Na^{+}}] = [\\mathrm{OH^{-}}] + [\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}]$$\n\nSubstituting the stoichiometric result $[\\mathrm{Na^{+}}] = [\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}]$ into the charge balance equation, we obtain:\n$$[\\mathrm{H^{+}}] + [\\mathrm{Na^{+}}] = [\\mathrm{OH^{-}}] + [\\mathrm{Na^{+}}]$$\nThe concentrations of the spectator ions cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n$$[\\mathrm{H^{+}}] = [\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$$\n\nThird, we apply the water autoprotolysis equilibrium, defined by the ion product of water, $K_{w}$:\n$$K_{w} = [\\mathrm{H^{+}}][\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$$\nAt $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the value is given as $K_{w} = 1.0\\times 10^{-14}$.\n\nWe can now solve for $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$. Substituting the condition $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}] = [\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$ from the charge balance into the expression for $K_{w}$:\n$$K_{w} = [\\mathrm{H^{+}}][\\mathrm{H^{+}}] = [\\mathrm{H^{+}}]^{2}$$\nSolving for $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$:\n$$[\\mathrm{H^{+}}] = \\sqrt{K_{w}}$$\nUsing the provided value for $K_{w}$:\n$$[\\mathrm{H^{+}}] = \\sqrt{1.0\\times 10^{-14}} = 1.0\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nFinally, the pH is calculated from its definition:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H^{+}}])$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}(1.0\\times 10^{-7})$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = 7.00$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures. This implies that the given constants, particularly $K_{w}$, should be treated with sufficient precision. Assuming $K_{w} = 1.000\\times 10^{-14}$, then $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}] = 1.000\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$. The number of decimal places in a pH value corresponds to the number of significant figures in the $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}]$ concentration. Therefore, a concentration with four significant figures results in a pH with four decimal places. However, the request for \"four significant figures\" for the pH value itself (e.g., $7.000$) is a common convention, corresponding to three decimal places. We will adhere to this convention.\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}(1.000\\times 10^{-7}) = 7.000$$\n\nThe fact that the initial concentrations are very dilute is what makes correct application of first principles essential, as naive approximations might fail for other points on the titration curve (e.g., the starting pH). However, at the equivalence point of a strong acid-strong base titration, the symmetry of the system invariably leads to $[\\mathrm{H^{+}}] = [\\mathrm{OH^{-}}]$, and thus a pH of exactly $7$ at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, regardless of the initial concentrations, provided the acid and base are strong.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.000}$$", "id": "2918633"}, {"introduction": "Real-world solutions are rarely ideal, and the electrostatic interactions between ions can significantly alter chemical equilibria—an effect captured by the concept of activity.

It is scientifically sound and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe fundamental equilibrium in question is the dissociation of the monoprotic weak acid $HA$ in aqueous solution:\n$$HA \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H^{+}} + \\mathrm{A^{-}}$$\nThe thermodynamic equilibrium constant, $K_a$, is defined in terms of the activities ($a_i$) of the species involved:\n$$K_a = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}} a_{\\mathrm{A^{-}}}}{a_{HA}}$$\nActivity is related to molar concentration, $[i]$, by the activity coefficient, $\\gamma_i$, such that $a_i = \\gamma_i [i]$.

Since the Davies equation depends on the square of the ion charge, $z_i^2$, the activity coefficients for $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$ will be identical. Let us denote this common value as $\\gamma_{\\pm}$.\n$$\\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\pm}) = -(0.509) (\\pm 1)^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{0.100}}{1+\\sqrt{0.100}} - 0.3(0.100) \\right)$$\n$$\\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\pm}) = -0.509 \\left( \\frac{0.316228}{1+0.316228} - 0.030 \\right)$$\n$$\\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\pm}) = -0.509 (0.240253 - 0.030)$$\n$$\\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\pm}) = -0.509 (0.210253) = -0.1070188$$\nSolving for the activity coefficient $\\gamma_{\\pm}$:\n$$\\gamma_{\\pm} = 10^{-0.1070188} = 0.781635$$\nTherefore, the ionic activity coefficients are $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}} = 0.781635$ and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{A^{-}}} = 0.781635$.\n\nNext, we define the conditional concentration-based constant $K_a'$. The problem gives the definition as $K_a' = K_a \\left( \\frac{\\gamma_{HA}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{A^{-}}}} \\right)$.

Thus, we can compute the numerical value of $K_a'$:\n$$K_a' = (1.000 \\times 10^{-5}) \\left( \\frac{1}{(0.781635)(0.781635)} \\right) = \\frac{1.000 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.610953} = 1.63678 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nUsing $K_a'$ instead of $K_a$ accounts for the non-ideal interactions in the electrolyte solution. In an idealized case where all $\\gamma_i = 1$, $K_a'$ would be equal to $K_a$. However, because the ionic activity coefficients $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H^{+}}}$ and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{A^{-}}}$ are less than $1$, the value of $K_a'$ is greater than $K_a$. This implies that at a given concentration ratio of $[HA]$ to $[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]$, the concentration of $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$ will be higher in the real solution than predicted by ideal theory. Consequently, the measured concentration-based pH will be lower throughout the titration curve compared to the ideal case.\n\nAt the half-neutralization point (or half-equivalence point), the analytical concentrations of the weak acid and its conjugate base are equal. This means $[HA] = [\\mathrm{A}^{-}]$. Substituting this condition into the expression for $K_a'$:\n$$K_a' = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}][\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[HA]} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}](1)}{(1)} = [\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$$\nThus, at the half-neutralization point, the hydrogen ion concentration is equal to the conditional constant, $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}] = K_a'$.\n\nThe concentration-based pH is defined as $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}])$. Therefore, the pH at the half-neutralization point is given in terms of $K_a'$ as:\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{half-equiv}} = -\\log_{10}(K_a') = \\mathrm{p}K_a'$$\nIn the idealized case, $\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{half-equiv}} = \\mathrm{p}K_a = 5.000$. The use of $K_a'$ alters the titration curve by shifting the pH at this point.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for this pH using the calculated value of $K_a'$:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}(1.63678 \\times 10^{-5})$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = 4.78598$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as required gives $4.786$.
