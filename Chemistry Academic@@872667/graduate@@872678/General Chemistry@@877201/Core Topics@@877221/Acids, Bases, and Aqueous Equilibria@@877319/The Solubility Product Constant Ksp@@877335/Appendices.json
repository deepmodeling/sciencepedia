My validation concludes that the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique, physically meaningful solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is a saturated solution of a sparingly soluble hydroxide, $M(OH)_2(s)$, in pure water at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The relevant chemical equilibria are the dissolution of the solid and the autoionization of water.\n\nThe chemical species present in the aqueous phase are the solvent, $H_2O(l)$, and the dissolved ions: the metal cation $M^{2+}(aq)$, the hydroxide ion $OH^{-}(aq)$, and the hydronium ion $H^{+}(aq)$. We seek the equilibrium concentrations of these ions: $[M^{2+}]$, $[OH^{-}]$, and $[H^{+}]$. To solve for these three unknowns, a system of three independent equations is required. These equations are derived from fundamental principles of equilibrium and mass and charge balance.\n\nThe governing equations are as follows:\n\n1.  **Solubility Product Equilibrium**: The dissolution of the solid $M(OH)_2(s)$ is described by the reaction:\n    $$M(OH)_2(s) \\rightleftharpoons M^{2+}(aq) + 2OH^{-}(aq)$$\n    The equilibrium expression for this process is given by the solubility product constant, $K_\\mathrm{sp}$:\n    $$K_\\mathrm{sp} = [M^{2+}][OH^{-}]^2 \\quad (\\text{Equation } 1)$$\n\n2.  **Water Autoionization Equilibrium**: Water undergoes autoionization according to the reaction:\n    $$H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H^{+}(aq) + OH^{-}(aq)$$\n    The equilibrium for this reaction is governed by the ion product of water, $K_\\mathrm{w}$, which at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is given as $1.0\\times 10^{-14}$.\n    $$K_\\mathrm{w} = [H^{+}][OH^{-}] = 1.0\\times 10^{-14} \\quad (\\text{Equation } 2)$$\n\n3.  **Charge Balance (Electroneutrality Principle)**: The solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of the molar concentrations of positive charges must equal the sum of the molar concentrations of negative charges. The ions contributing to charge are $M^{2+}$, $H^{+}$, and $OH^{-}$.\n    $$2[M^{2+}] + [H^{+}] = [OH^{-}] \\quad (\\text{Equation } 3)$$\n    The coefficient $2$ for $[M^{2+}]$ arises from the $+2$ charge of the metal cation.\n\nThis system of three equations is complete and sufficient to solve for the three unknown concentrations. The problem demands a solution without simplifying assumptions, such as assuming $[OH^{-}] \\gg [H^{+}]$. We will therefore combine these equations into a single equation for one variable. Let us choose $[OH^{-}]$ as the master variable, as it appears in all three equations.\n\nFrom Equation $1$, we can express $[M^{2+}]$ in terms of $[OH^{-}]$:\n$$[M^{2+}] = \\frac{K_\\mathrm{sp}}{[OH^{-}]^2}$$\n\nFrom Equation $2$, we can express $[H^{+}]$ in terms of $[OH^{-}]$:\n$$[H^{+}] = \\frac{K_\\mathrm{w}}{[OH^{-}]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $[M^{2+}]$ and $[H^{+}]$ into the charge balance (Equation $3$):\n$$2\\left(\\frac{K_\\mathrm{sp}}{[OH^{-}]^2}\\right) + \\frac{K_\\mathrm{w}}{[OH^{-}]} = [OH^{-}]$$\n\nTo eliminate the denominators, we multiply the entire equation by $[OH^{-}]^2$, assuming $[OH^{-}] \\neq 0$, which is physically necessary.\n$$2K_\\mathrm{sp} + K_\\mathrm{w}[OH^{-}] = [OH^{-}]^3$$\n\nRearranging this into a standard polynomial form, we obtain a cubic equation in the variable $[OH^{-}]$:\n$$[OH^{-}]^3 - K_\\mathrm{w}[OH^{-}] - 2K_\\mathrm{sp} = 0$$\n\nLet $x = [OH^{-}]$. The equation is $f(x) = x^3 - K_\\mathrm{w}x - 2K_\\mathrm{sp} = 0$. For a solution to be physically meaningful, the root $x$ must be real and positive. We can analyze the function $f(x)$ for $x > 0$. At $x=0$, $f(0) = -2K_\\mathrm{sp}  0$. The derivative is $f'(x) = 3x^2 - K_\\mathrm{w}$. There is a local minimum at $x = \\sqrt{K_\\mathrm{w}/3}$, where the function's value is negative. As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x) \\to \\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist exactly one positive real root for $x$. This confirms that our formulation is well-posed and will yield a unique physical solution for $[OH^{-}]$.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1.  For each given value of $K_\\mathrm{sp}$, construct the coefficients of the cubic polynomial $x^3 + 0x^2 - K_\\mathrm{w}x - 2K_\\mathrm{sp} = 0$.\n2.  Solve this polynomial equation numerically to find its roots.\n3.  Select the single unique positive real root, which corresponds to the equilibrium concentration $[OH^{-}]$.\n4.  Calculate the remaining quantities using the value of $[OH^{-}]$:\n    -   $[M^{2+}] = \\frac{K_\\mathrm{sp}}{[OH^{-}]^2}$\n    -   $[H^{+}] = \\frac{K_\\mathrm{w}}{[OH^{-}]}$\n    -   $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}])$\n5.  Report the final values for $([M^{2+}], [OH^{-}], \\mathrm{pH})$, rounded to six significant figures as specified.\n\nThis rigorous method avoids any potentially invalid simplifying assumptions and is applicable across a wide range of $K_\\mathrm{sp}$ values, including those where the contribution of water autoionization to the hydroxide concentration is significant.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef round_to_sf(x, sf):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rounds a number x to a specified number of significant figures (sf).\n    \"\"\"\n    if x == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    # Calculate the order of magnitude of the number\n    order_of_magnitude = np.floor(np.log10(np.abs(x)))\n    # Determine the number of decimal places for rounding\n    decimals = int(sf - 1 - order_of_magnitude)\n    return np.round(x, decimals)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for equilibrium concentrations in a saturated M(OH)2 solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the fundamental constant from the problem statement.\n    K_w = 1.0e-14\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases_ksp = [\n        1.0e-16,  # Test 1\n        1.8e-11,  # Test 2\n        5.5e-6,   # Test 3\n        1.0e-20   # Test 4\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    for ksp in test_cases_ksp:\n        # Formulate the coefficients for the cubic polynomial in [OH-]:\n        # [OH-]^3 - K_w*[OH-] - 2*K_sp = 0\n        # This corresponds to x^3 + 0*x^2 - K_w*x - 2*K_sp = 0\n        coeffs = [1, 0, -K_w, -2 * ksp]\n\n        # Use numpy to find the roots of the polynomial.\n        roots = np.roots(coeffs)\n\n        # The physically meaningful solution is the single positive real root.\n        # Numerical methods might yield small imaginary parts for real roots.\n        oh_conc = 0.0\n        for root in roots:\n            if np.isreal(root) and np.real(root) > 0:\n                oh_conc = np.real(root)\n                break\n        \n        # Calculate the other equilibrium concentrations and pH.\n        m_conc = ksp / (oh_conc**2)\n        h_conc = K_w / oh_conc\n        ph = -np.log10(h_conc)\n\n        # Round the results to six significant figures.\n        m_conc_rounded = round_to_sf(m_conc, 6)\n        oh_conc_rounded = round_to_sf(oh_conc, 6)\n        ph_rounded = round_to_sf(ph, 6)\n        \n        all_results.append([m_conc_rounded, oh_conc_rounded, ph_rounded])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The str() representation of a list of lists is almost correct.\n    # We remove spaces to match the required dense format.\n    print(str(all_results).replace(\" \", \"\"))\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2961770"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the idealized world of pure water, we now explore the impact of non-ideal solution behavior.

We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe dissolution of the sparingly soluble salt $MX$ is described by the equilibrium:\n$$MX(s) \\rightleftharpoons M^{+}(aq) + X^{-}(aq)$$\nThe condition for chemical equilibrium is the equality of the chemical potentials of the reactants and products. For this reaction, the condition is:\n$$\\mu_{MX(s)} = \\mu_{M^{+}(aq)} + \\mu_{X^{-}(aq)}$$\nThe chemical potential $\\mu_i$ of a species $i$ is related to its standard chemical potential $\\mu_i^{\\circ}$ and its activity $a_i$ by the expression $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_i$, where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

It correctly identifies the primary equilibrium and expresses the constant in terms of the activities of the free ions involved, raised to their stoichiometric powers. This is the foundational definition from which all further analysis of solubility proceeds.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because hydrolysis and protonation redistribute fluoride between $F^-(aq)$ and $HF(aq)$, a correct thermodynamic definition of $K_{sp}$ for $FeF_3(s)$ is $K_{sp} = \\big(a_{Fe^{3+}} + a_{FeOH^{2+}} + a_{Fe(OH)_2^+} + \\cdots\\big)\\,\\big(a_{F^-} + a_{HF}\\big)^3$.**\nThis statement attempts to redefine $K_{sp}$ by incorporating species from secondary equilibria. The quantities $\\big(a_{Fe^{3+}} + a_{FeOH^{2+}} + \\cdots\\big)$ and $\\big(a_{F^-} + a_{HF}\\big)$ are not thermodynamically well-defined quantities that would appear in an equilibrium constant expression. This expression confuses the thermodynamic $K_{sp}$ with a *conditional* or *apparent* solubility product, which is often expressed in terms of total analytical concentrations ($[Fe]_{tot}$ and $[F]_{tot}$), not sums of activities. The thermodynamic constant $K_{sp}$ is strictly associated with the primary dissolution reaction only.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Since hydrolysis formally involves water, the rigorous thermodynamic expression must divide by a power of the water activity, e.g., $K_{sp} = \\dfrac{a_{Fe^{3+}}\\,a_{F^-}^3}{a_{H_2O}^n}$ for some integer $n \\ge 1$.**\nThe primary dissolution reaction, $FeF_3(s) \\rightleftharpoons Fe^{3+}(aq) + 3\\,F^-(aq)$, does not involve $H_2O$ as a reactant or product. The designation $(aq)$ signifies aquation, a state of solvation, but water itself does not participate with a stoichiometric coefficient in this specific balanced equation. While the constants for hydrolysis reactions (e.g., $Fe^{3+} + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons FeOH^{2+} + H^+$) would involve $a_{H_2O}$, this does not apply to the $K_{sp}$ for the dissolution of the anhydrous salt. Furthermore, in dilute aqueous solutions, $a_{H_2O}$ is conventionally treated as unity and incorporated into the value of the constant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In systems with strong hydrolysis and complexation, $K_{sp}$ is not strictly defined because free-ion activities cannot be measured directly; therefore, $K_{sp}$ must be operationally redefined in terms of total analytical concentrations $[Fe]_{tot}$ and $[F]_{tot}$.**\nThis statement is flawed on multiple grounds. First, the existence and definition of a thermodynamic quantity are independent of the ease of its measurement. $K_{sp}$ is always strictly defined by the laws of thermodynamics. Second, while direct experimental measurement of single-ion activities is indeed a challenge, free-ion concentrations can be measured or estimated (e.g., using ion-selective electrodes), and activities can be calculated from concentrations using activity coefficient models. Conflating the fundamental constant with an \"operational\" one defined by total concentrations is a conceptual error. The latter is a conditional constant, whose value depends on solution conditions like $\\mathrm{pH}$, whereas the thermodynamic $K_{sp}$ is invariant at a given temperature and pressure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Secondary equilibria alter speciation and thus the relationship between measurable totals and free-ion activities, but they do not change $K_{sp}$, which is anchored to the primary dissolution reaction; their effects are incorporated via auxiliary equilibrium constants and mass-balance constraints, sometimes yielding a conditional or apparent solubility product that depends on variables such as $\\mathrm{pH}$, while the underlying $K_{sp}$ remains invariant at fixed $T$, $P$, and $I$.**\nThis statement provides a comprehensive and accurate description of the situation. It correctly distinguishes between the invariant thermodynamic constant $K_{sp}$ and the factors that affect the overall solubility. It correctly notes that secondary reactions (side reactions) alter the speciation, which means the concentrations of the free ions $Fe^{3+}$ and $F^-$ are only a fraction of the total dissolved iron and fluoride. The effect of these side reactions on the total solubility must be calculated by considering all simultaneous equilibria (using their respective equilibrium constants like $K_a$, $K_f$, etc.) and mass balance equations. This leads to the concept of a conditional or apparent solubility product ($K_{sp}'$), which is a function of system parameters like $\\mathrm{pH}$, while the true $K_{sp}$ remains constant at constant temperature and pressure. The mention of fixed $I$ correctly implies constant activity coefficients, which simplifies the relationship between activity-based and concentration-based constants but does not alter the fundamental principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nBased on the analysis, statements A and E are the only ones that are strictly correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2961808"}]}
