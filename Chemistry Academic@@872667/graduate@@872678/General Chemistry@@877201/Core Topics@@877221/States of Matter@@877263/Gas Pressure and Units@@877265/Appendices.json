It requires an audit of a flawed calculation and the execution of a correct calculation based on first principles and coherent units. The problem statement is valid, as it is self-contained, scientifically grounded in established principles of physical chemistry, and well-posed. We shall first audit the colleague's procedure and then determine the correct pressure.\n\nThe governing equation for an ideal gas is the ideal gas law:\n$$pV = nRT$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $V$ is the volume, $n$ is the amount of substance, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nFirst, we audit the colleague's calculation.

The colleague has conflated atmospheres with bars. While numerically similar ($1\\,\\mathrm{atm} = 1.01325\\,\\mathrm{bar}$), they are distinct units, and such imprecision is unacceptable in scientific work.\n\nStep 2: The colleague attempted to convert the result to pascals using the relation $1\\,\\mathrm{bar} = 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.
