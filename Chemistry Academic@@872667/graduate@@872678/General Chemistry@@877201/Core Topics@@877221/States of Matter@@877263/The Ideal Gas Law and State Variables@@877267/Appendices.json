All provided constants and definitions are standard and correct. The tasks are logically structured and lead to a unique, verifiable solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the numerical value of the universal gas constant, $R$, in the unit system $\\mathrm{L\\,atm\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$. This will be accomplished in three steps as specified.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the universal gas constant $R$, the Boltzmann constant $k_B$, and the Avogadro constant $N_A$. The ideal gas law can be expressed in two forms: a macroscopic form and a microscopic form.\n\nThe macroscopic form, relating pressure $P$, volume $V$, temperature $T$, and the amount of substance in moles $n$, is given by:\n$$PV = nRT$$\nHere, $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n\nThe microscopic form, derived from statistical mechanics, relates the same macroscopic properties to the number of molecules $N$:\n$$PV = N k_B T$$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe number of molecules $N$ is related to the number of moles $n$ through the Avogadro constant $N_A$, which is defined as the number of constituent particles per mole of substance:\n$$N = n N_A$$\n\nBy substituting this expression for $N$ into the microscopic equation of state, we obtain:\n$$PV = (n N_A) k_B T$$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$PV = n (N_A k_B) T$$\n\nComparing this rearranged microscopic equation with the macroscopic equation $PV = nRT$, we see that the terms multiplying $nT$ must be equal. This provides the fundamental connection between $R$, $N_A$, and $k_B$:\n$$R = N_A k_B$$\nThis completes the first task. The units of $R$ determined from this expression will be the product of the units of $N_A$ ($\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$) and $k_B$ ($\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$), resulting in $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\nSecond, we must derive the conversion factor between the energy unit joule ($\\mathrm{J}$) and the product of pressure and volume units, liter-atmosphere ($\\mathrm{L\\,atm}$). This is necessary to convert $R$ from its SI value to the desired unit system. We start with the expression $1\\,\\mathrm{L\\,atm}$ and use the provided conversion factors.\nGiven:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}$$\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{atm} = 101\\,325\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\n\nWe can write:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{L\\,atm} = (1\\,\\mathrm{L}) \\times (1\\,\\mathrm{atm}) = (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}) \\times (101\\,325\\,\\mathrm{Pa})$$\n\nThe pascal ($\\mathrm{Pa}$) is the SI unit of pressure, defined as one newton per square meter ($\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}}$).\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 1\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}}$$\n\nSubstituting this definition into our expression:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{L\\,atm} = (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}) \\times (101\\,325\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}})$$\nMultiplying the numerical values and combining the units yields:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{L\\,atm} = (10^{-3} \\times 101\\,325) \\, (\\mathrm{m^3 \\cdot N \\cdot m^{-2}}) = 101.325\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m}$$\n\nThe joule ($\\mathrm{J}$) is the SI unit of energy, defined as the work done when a force of one newton acts over a distance of one meter.\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{J} = 1\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m}$$\n\nTherefore, we can conclude the energy equivalence:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{L\\,atm} = 101.325\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nThis completes the second task.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in statistical thermodynamics applied to an ideal gas. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe foundation of this analysis is the equipartition theorem, which states that for a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$, the average energy per molecule associated with each quadratic degree of freedom is $\\frac{1}{2}k_B T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The total number of thermally accessible quadratic degrees of freedom per molecule, denoted by $f$, determines the thermal properties of the gas.\n\nFirst, we must determine the value of $f$ for a sulfur dioxide molecule, $\\text{SO}_2$, under the specified conditions. A molecule composed of $N$ atoms has a total of $3N$ degrees of freedom. For $\\text{SO}_2$, $N=3$, so there are $3 \\times 3 = 9$ total degrees of freedom. These are partitioned into translational, rotational, and vibrational modes.\n\n$1$. **Translational Degrees of Freedom**: Any molecule moving in three-dimensional space possesses $3$ translational degrees of freedom, corresponding to motion along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes. Each contributes a quadratic term to the kinetic energy. Thus, the number of translational degrees of freedom is $f_{\\text{trans}} = 3$.\n\n$2$. **Rotational Degrees of Freedom**: The problem states that $\\text{SO}_2$ is a bent, nonlinear molecule. A nonlinear molecule can rotate about three independent axes. Therefore, it has $3$ rotational degrees of freedom. The number of rotational degrees of freedom is $f_{\\text{rot}} = 3$.\n\n$3$. **Vibrational Degrees of Freedom**: The number of vibrational modes is the remainder of the total degrees of freedom: $3N - f_{\\text{trans}} - f_{\\text{rot}} = 3(3) - 3 - 3 = 3$. Each vibrational mode corresponds to two quadratic terms in the Hamiltonian (one kinetic, one potential). However, the problem explicitly states that \"all vibrational modes are frozen (do not contribute to the thermal energy)\". This is a physically sound approximation for the given temperature range $T \\in [220, 380] \\ \\mathrm{K}$, as the characteristic vibrational temperatures of $\\text{SO}_2$ are significantly higher. Consequently, the contribution from vibrational modes is zero.\n\nThe total number of independent quadratic degrees of freedom, $f$, that contribute to the thermal energy is the sum of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom:\n$$f = f_{\\text{trans}} + f_{\\text{rot}} = 3 + 3 = 6$$\n\nWith the value of $f$ established, we can derive the molar heat capacities. The molar internal energy, $U_m$, of an ideal gas is the total energy of one mole of molecules. Using the equipartition theorem, the average energy per molecule is $\\frac{f}{2}k_B T$.

We use the relationship for an ideal gas, known as Mayer's relation:\n$$C_{P,m} = C_{V,m} + R$$\nThis relation is derived from the definition of molar enthalpy, $H_m = U_m + (PV)_m$.

The entropy change $\\Delta \\bar{S}_{II,2}$ is found by integrating the second term of the $(T,V)$ expression for $d\\bar{S}$:\n   $$\\Delta \\bar{S}_{II,2} = \\int_{\\bar{V}_{1}}^{\\bar{V}_{2}} \\frac{R}{\\bar{V}} d\\bar{V} = R \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\bar{V}_{2}}{\\bar{V}_{1}}\\right)$$\n   Substituting the expressions for molar volumes:\n   $$\\Delta \\bar{S}_{II,2} = R \\ln\\left(\\frac{RT_{2}/P_{2}}{RT_{1}/P_{1}}\\right) = R \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{2}P_{1}}{T_{1}P_{2}}\\right) = R \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\\right) - R \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}}\\right)$$\nThe total entropy change for Path II is the sum $\\Delta \\bar{S}_{II} = \\Delta \\bar{S}_{II,1} + \\Delta \\bar{S}_{II,2}$:\n$$\\Delta \\bar{S}_{II} = \\left[(a-R) \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\\right) + b(T_{2} - T_{1}) - \\frac{c}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{2}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{T_{1}^{2}}\\right)\\right] + \\left[R \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\\right) - R \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}}\\right)\\right]$$\nCombining terms, the $R \\ln(T_{2}/T_{1})$ terms cancel each other:\n$$\\Delta \\bar{S}_{II} = a \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\\right) + b(T_{2} - T_{1}) - \\frac{c}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{2}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{T_{1}^{2}}\\right) - R \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}}\\right)$$\nThe expressions for $\\Delta \\bar{S}_{I}$ and $\\Delta \\bar{S}_{II}$ are identical.
