A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Expression for Total Heat ($q$)**\n\nThe analysis begins with the First Law of Thermodynamics for a closed system:\n$$dU = \\delta q + \\delta w$$\nwhere $dU$ is the change in internal energy, $\\delta q$ is the heat added to the system, and $\\delta w$ is the work done on the system. The problem specifies that only pressure-volume work is possible. For a quasi-static (reversible) process, the work done on the system is given by $\\delta w = -P dV$, where $P$ is the system pressure and $dV$ is the change in volume. Thus, the First Law becomes:\n$$dU = \\delta q - P dV$$\nThe definition of enthalpy, $H$, is $H = U + PV$. The differential of enthalpy is:\n$$dH = dU + P dV + V dP$$\nSubstituting the expression for $dU$ from the First Law into the differential of enthalpy yields:\n$$dH = (\\delta q - P dV) + P dV + V dP = \\delta q + V dP$$\nThe problem states that the heating occurs at constant external pressure. For a quasi-static process, the internal pressure of the system equilibrates with the constant external pressure, meaning the process is isobaric ($P = \\text{constant}$). Therefore, the differential of pressure is zero, $dP = 0$. Under this condition, the change in enthalpy is equal to the heat supplied:\n$$dH = \\delta q_{p}$$\nThe subscript $p$ denotes that this relation holds at constant pressure.\n\nThe heat capacity at constant pressure, $C_{p}$, is defined as the partial derivative of enthalpy with respect to temperature at constant pressure:\n$$C_{p} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial T}\\right)_{p}$$\nFor a process occurring at constant pressure, this can be rearranged to give the differential change in enthalpy:\n$$dH = C_{p} dT$$\nThe problem provides the mass-specific heat capacity, which is the heat capacity per unit mass. Let us denote this by $c_{p}(T)$ to distinguish it from the total heat capacity $C_{p}$. The problem statement gives $c_{p}(T) = a+bT$. The total heat capacity of the sample of mass $m$ is $C_{p}(T) = m \\cdot c_{p}(T) = m(a+bT)$.\n\nCombining our findings, we have an expression for the differential amount of heat, $\\delta q_{p}$, that must be supplied to change the temperature of the sample by $dT$:\n$$\\delta q_{p} = dH = C_{p}(T) dT = m(a+bT) dT$$\nTo find the total heat, $q$, required to raise the temperature from $T_{1}$ to $T_{2}$, we must integrate this differential expression between the initial and final temperatures:\n$$q = \\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} m(a+bT) dT$$\nSince the mass $m$ and constants $a$ and $b$ are not dependent on temperature, they can be factored out of the integral where appropriate:\n$$q = m \\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} (a+bT) dT$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$q = m \\left[ aT + \\frac{1}{2}bT^{2} \\right]_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}}$$\nEvaluating the definite integral at the limits $T_{2}$ and $T_{1}$:\n$$q = m \\left( \\left(aT_{2} + \\frac{1}{2}bT_{2}^{2}\\right) - \\left(aT_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}bT_{1}^{2}\\right) \\right)$$\nRearranging the terms gives the final closed-form expression for the total heat supplied:\n$$q = m \\left( a(T_{2} - T_{1}) + \\frac{1}{2}b(T_{2}^{2} - T_{1}^{2}) \\right)$$\n\n**Analysis of the Heating Curve Curvature**\n\nA heating curve plots temperature $T$ on the vertical axis against the cumulative heat input $q$ on the horizontal axis. The slope of this curve at any point is given by the derivative $\\frac{dT}{dq}$.\nFrom our differential relationship $\\delta q = m \\cdot c_{p}(T) dT$, we can write:\n$$\\frac{dq}{dT} = m \\cdot c_{p}(T) = m(a+bT)$$\nThe slope of the heating curve is the reciprocal of this expression:\n$$\\text{Slope} = \\frac{dT}{dq} = \\frac{1}{m(a+bT)}$$\nThe curvature of the plot is determined by the sign of the second derivative, $\\frac{d^{2}T}{dq^{2}}$. We can compute this derivative using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}T}{dq^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dq}\\left(\\frac{dT}{dq}\\right) = \\frac{d}{dT}\\left(\\frac{dT}{dq}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{dT}{dq}$$\nFirst, we find the derivative of the slope with respect to temperature:\n$$\\frac{d}{dT}\\left(\\frac{dT}{dq}\\right) = \\frac{d}{dT}\\left( [m(a+bT)]^{-1} \\right) = -1 \\cdot [m(a+bT)]^{-2} \\cdot (mb) = \\frac{-mb}{m^{2}(a+bT)^{2}} = \\frac{-b}{m(a+bT)^{2}}$$\nNow, we multiply this result by $\\frac{dT}{dq}$:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}T}{dq^{2}} = \\left( \\frac{-b}{m(a+bT)^{2}} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{m(a+bT)} \\right) = \\frac{-b}{m^{2}(a+bT)^{3}}$$\nThe sign of the curvature is the sign of this second derivative. The mass $m$ is positive, so $m^{2}$ is positive. The absolute temperature $T$ is positive. For any physical substance, the heat capacity $c_{p}(T) = a+bT$ must be positive over the temperature range of interest. Therefore, the entire denominator, $m^{2}(a+bT)^{3}$, is a positive quantity.\nConsequently, the sign of the curvature is determined solely by the sign of the numerator, $-b$.\n- If $b  0$, the heat capacity increases with temperature. The curvature $\\frac{d^{2}T}{dq^{2}}$ is negative. A negative second derivative indicates that the curve is **concave down**. This means that as more heat is added, the temperature increases more slowly (the slope decreases), which is consistent with an increasing heat capacity.\n- If $b  0$, the heat capacity decreases with temperature. The curvature $\\frac{d^{2}T}{dq^{2}}$ is positive. A positive second derivative indicates that the curve is **concave up**. This means that as more heat is added, the temperature increases more rapidly (the slope increases), consistent with a decreasing heat capacity.\n- If $b = 0$, the heat capacity is constant. The curvature is zero, and the heating curve $T$ vs. $q$ is a straight line, as expected.\n\nThe temperature dependence of $C_{p}(T)$ manifests as a non-zero curvature in the single-phase heating segment. The sign of the constant $b$ directly determines the sign of this curvature.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{m \\left( a(T_{2} - T_{1}) + \\frac{1}{2}b(T_{2}^{2} - T_{1}^{2}) \\right)}\n$$", "id": "2951034"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the heating process within a single phase, we now turn our focus to the transition itself.

I will first derive the required relationship from fundamental principles, then perform the calculation, and finally provide the physical interpretation as requested.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the molar entropy of fusion, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fus}}$, in terms of the molar enthalpy of fusion, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}$, and the coexistence temperature, $T$. We are instructed to begin from the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics and the definition of enthalpy.\n\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics for a closed system undergoing a reversible process is given by:\n$$dU = dq_{\\mathrm{rev}} + dw_{\\mathrm{rev}}$$\nwhere $dU$ is the change in internal energy, $dq_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is the heat supplied reversibly, and $dw_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is the work done on the system. For a process involving only pressure-volume work, $dw_{\\mathrm{rev}} = -P dV$. Thus,\n$$dU = dq_{\\mathrm{rev}} - P dV$$\nThe definition of enthalpy, $H$, is:\n$$H = U + PV$$\nThe differential form is:\n$$dH = dU + P dV + V dP$$\nSubstituting the expression for $dU$ from the First Law into the differential of enthalpy, we obtain:\n$$dH = (dq_{\\mathrm{rev}} - P dV) + P dV + V dP$$\nThe terms $-P dV$ and $+P dV$ cancel, which simplifies the expression to:\n$$dH = dq_{\\mathrm{rev}} + V dP$$\nThe problem specifies that the melting transition occurs at constant pressure $P$. Therefore, the change in pressure $dP$ is zero ($dP = 0$), and the expression further simplifies to:\n$$dH = dq_{\\mathrm{rev}} \\quad (\\text{at constant } P)$$\nThis equation shows that for a reversible process conducted at constant pressure, the enthalpy change is precisely equal to the heat exchanged.\n\nNext, we invoke the Second Law of Thermodynamics. For a reversible process occurring at a constant temperature $T$, the change in entropy $dS$ is defined as:\n$$dS = \\frac{dq_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{T}$$\nSubstituting our prior result $dq_{\\mathrm{rev}} = dH$ into this definition gives:\n$$dS = \\frac{dH}{T} \\quad (\\text{at constant } T \\text{ and } P)$$\nThis relationship holds for any infinitesimal reversible change at constant temperature and pressure. A first-order phase transition, such as melting, occurs at a specific coexistence temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{fus}}$, and pressure, $P$. To find the total molar change for the finite process of melting, we integrate this differential form from the initial solid state (s) to the final liquid state (l). Since the temperature $T_{\\mathrm{fus}}$ is constant throughout the transition, it can be taken outside the integral:\n$$\\int_{\\mathrm{s}}^{\\mathrm{l}} dS = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{fus}}} \\int_{\\mathrm{s}}^{\\mathrm{l}} dH$$\nThe integrals yield the total molar changes in entropy and enthalpy for fusion:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fus}} = S_{\\mathrm{liquid}} - S_{\\mathrm{solid}}$$\n$$\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}} = H_{\\mathrm{liquid}} - H_{\\mathrm{solid}}$$\nThus, we arrive at the final, well-known thermodynamic relationship for a phase transition at equilibrium:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fus}} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}}{T_{\\mathrm{fus}}}$$\n\nThe second task is to calculate the value of $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fus}}$ for the molecular crystal “X”.

Therefore, the result must be rounded to $4$ significant figures:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fus}} = -1.302\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\n\nThe third task is to explain the physical interpretation of the sign of the result.\nThe molar entropy of fusion, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fus}}$, is the difference between the molar entropy of the liquid phase and the molar entropy of the solid phase ($S_{\\mathrm{liquid}} - S_{\\mathrm{solid}}$). For conventional substances, the liquid phase is structurally more disordered than the highly ordered crystalline solid phase. Consequently, the entropy of the liquid is greater than that of the solid ($S_{\\mathrm{liquid}}  S_{\\mathrm{solid}}$), and the entropy of fusion is positive ($\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fus}}  0$).\nIn this case, the calculated $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fus}}$ is negative. This indicates that $S_{\\mathrm{liquid}}  S_{\\mathrm{solid}}$, meaning the liquid phase is more ordered than the solid phase at the coexistence point. This is an anomalous behavior. It is the definitive thermodynamic characteristic of a substance that undergoes \"inverse melting,\" where the formation of the liquid from the solid is an exothermic process ($\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}  0$) and is accompanied by an increase in structural order.
