Second, the determination of the compositions of two liquid phases in equilibrium for a given overall mixture composition.\n\nPart 1: Analysis of Isopleths\nAn isopleth is defined as a line of constant composition for one component. In this case, we consider an isopleth for component $C$, where its mole fraction $x_C$ is held at a constant value, say $k$.\n$$x_C = k, \\quad \\text{where } k \\in [0, 1]$$\nThe coordinate system is defined by $u = x_A$ and $v = x_B$.

It has a constant slope of $-1$ and a $v$-intercept of $(1 - k)$. This rigorously proves that isopleths for component $C$ are straight, parallel lines in the chosen coordinate system.\n\nPart 2: Determination of Equilibrium Phase Compositions\nThe overall composition of the mixture is given as $x_A^{(0)} = 0.60$, $x_B^{(0)} = 0.20$, and $x_C^{(0)} = 0.20$. In the $(u,v)$ coordinate system, this corresponds to the point $(u^{(0)}, v^{(0)}) = (0.60, 0.20)$.\n\nAccording to the Gibbs phase rule for a ternary system at fixed temperature and pressure, a two-phase region has one degree of freedom. However, the problem provides sufficient empirical relations to determine the state completely. The principle of phase equilibrium dictates that if this overall composition lies within the miscibility gap (the two-phase region), it will separate into two immiscible liquid phases. The compositions of these two phases, which we will denote as $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, lie on the binodal curve. The overall composition point $(u^{(0)}, v^{(0)})$ must lie on the straight line segment, known as a tie-line, that connects the two equilibrium phase composition points $(u^{(\\alpha)}, v^{(\\alpha)})$ and $(u^{(\\beta)}, v^{(\\beta)})$.\n\nFirst, we must verify that the point $(u^{(0)}, v^{(0)}) = (0.60, 0.20)$ lies inside the miscibility gap defined by the two binodal branches. At $u = 0.60$:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{low}}(0.60) = 0.05 + 0.25(0.60) - 0.20(0.60)^{2} = 0.05 + 0.15 - 0.072 = 0.128$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{high}}(0.60) = 0.35 - 0.10(0.60) - 0.10(0.60)^{2} = 0.35 - 0.06 - 0.036 = 0.254$$\nSince $v_{\\mathrm{low}}(0.60) = 0.128  v^{(0)} = 0.20  v_{\\mathrm{high}}(0.60) = 0.254$, the overall composition is indeed in the two-phase region.\n\nThe problem states that all tie-lines have a constant slope $s = -0.40$ in the $(u,v)$ plane. We can therefore determine the equation of the specific tie-line that passes through the overall composition point $(0.60, 0.20)$:\n$$v - v^{(0)} = s(u - u^{(0)})$$\n$$v - 0.20 = -0.40(u - 0.60)$$\n$$v = -0.40u + 0.24 + 0.20 \\implies v = -0.40u + 0.44$$\nThe compositions of the two equilibrium phases are the intersection points of this tie-line with the two branches of the binodal curve. Let phase $\\alpha$ be the point on the lower branch $v_{\\mathrm{low}}(u)$ and phase $\\beta$ be on the upper branch $v_{\\mathrm{high}}(u)$.\n\nTo find the composition of phase $\\alpha$, we set $v_{\\mathrm{low}}(u)$ equal to the tie-line equation:\n$$0.05 + 0.25u - 0.20u^{2} = -0.40u + 0.44$$\nRearranging into a standard quadratic form $au^2 + bu + c = 0$:\n$$0.20u^{2} - 0.65u + 0.39 = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $u = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$u^{(\\alpha)} = \\frac{0.65 \\pm \\sqrt{(-0.65)^{2} - 4(0.20)(0.39)}}{2(0.20)} = \\frac{0.65 \\pm \\sqrt{0.4225 - 0.312}}{0.40} = \\frac{0.65 \\pm \\sqrt{0.1105}}{0.40}$$\nThe two roots are $u \\approx 2.456$ and $u \\approx 0.7940$. The first root is physically impossible as a mole fraction. Thus, we select the valid root:\n$$x_A^{(\\alpha)} = u^{(\\alpha)} \\approx 0.79396$$\nThe corresponding $v$ coordinate is found using the tie-line equation:\n$$x_B^{(\\alpha)} = v^{(\\alpha)} = -0.40(0.79396) + 0.44 \\approx 0.122416$$\nThe third mole fraction is found by the balance:\n$$x_C^{(\\alpha)} = 1 - u^{(\\alpha)} - v^{(\\alpha)} = 1 - 0.79396 - 0.122416 \\approx 0.083624$$\n\nTo find the composition of phase $\\beta$, we set $v_{\\mathrm{high}}(u)$ equal to the tie-line equation:\n$$0.35 - 0.10u - 0.10u^{2} = -0.40u + 0.44$$\nRearranging into quadratic form:\n$$0.10u^{2} - 0.30u + 0.09 = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$$u^{(\\beta)} = \\frac{0.30 \\pm \\sqrt{(-0.30)^{2} - 4(0.10)(0.09)}}{2(0.10)} = \\frac{0.30 \\pm \\sqrt{0.09 - 0.036}}{0.20} = \\frac{0.30 \\pm \\sqrt{0.054}}{0.20}$$\nThe two roots are $u \\approx 2.662$ and $u \\approx 0.3381$. Again, we discard the non-physical root.\n$$x_A^{(\\beta)} = u^{(\\beta)} \\approx 0.338105$$\nThe corresponding $v$ coordinate is:\n$$x_B^{(\\beta)} = v^{(\\beta)} = -0.40(0.338105) + 0.44 \\approx 0.304758$$\nThe third mole fraction is:\n$$x_C^{(\\beta)} = 1 - u^{(\\beta)} - v^{(\\beta)} = 1 - 0.338105 - 0.304758 \\approx 0.357137$$\n\nFinally, we round each mole fraction to four significant figures as requested.\nFor phase $\\alpha$:\n$x_A^{(\\alpha)} = 0.7940$\n$x_B^{(\\alpha)} = 0.1224$\n$x_C^{(\\alpha)} = 0.08362$\n\nFor phase $\\beta$:\n$x_A^{(\\beta)} = 0.3381$\n$x_B^{(\\beta)} = 0.3048$\n$x_C^{(\\beta)} = 0.3571$\n\nThe six mole fractions representing the compositions of the two equilibrium phases are now determined.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7940  0.1224  0.08362  0.3381  0.3048  0.3571 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2952517"}]}
