This gaseous mixture is placed in a chamber separated from a vacuum by a porous barrier. The molar mass of the `Light-Gv` isotope is known to be 240.0 g/mol. After a short period, a small amount of the gas has effused through the barrier into the vacuum chamber. Analysis of this effused gas reveals that the molar ratio of `Light-Gv`F6 to `Heavy-Gv`F6 is 1.050 to 1.000.\n\nGiven the atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is 19.00 g/mol, calculate the molar mass of the heavier isotope, `Heavy-Gv`.
