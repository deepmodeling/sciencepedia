It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics and chemical kinetics, specifically collision theory. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution without internal contradictions. It presents a standard, albeit non-trivial, derivation in physical chemistry.\n\nWe begin with the distribution of relative velocities for a bimolecular system in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$. For two colliding species with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, the motion can be described in terms of the center-of-mass motion and the relative motion. The distribution of the relative velocity vector, $\\vec{v}_r$, follows a Maxwell-Boltzmann form, but with the reduced mass $\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$. The probability density function for $\\vec{v}_r$ is given by:\n$$\ng(\\vec{v}_r) = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu v_r^2}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $v_r = |\\vec{v}_r|$.\n\nThe problem specifies a reaction model where reaction occurs only if the component of the relative translational kinetic energy along the line of centers, $E_n$, exceeds a threshold $E_0$. The component of the relative velocity along this line of centers is the normal component, $v_n$. Thus, $E_n = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu v_n^2$.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that \"the collision probability is proportional to the normal component of the relative speed for approaching pairs.\" This means that to find the distribution of any quantity among the population of *colliding* pairs, we must weight the distribution for *all* pairs by a factor of $v_n$.\n\nLet us consider the distribution of the normal component of relative velocity, $v_n$, for an arbitrary pair of molecules. In the 3D Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, each velocity component ($v_x, v_y, v_z$) is independent and follows a 1D Gaussian distribution. If we align one axis with the line of centers, the distribution of the velocity component along that axis, $v_n$, is:\n$$\nf(v_n) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu v_n^2}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe distribution of $v_n$ for colliding pairs, $f_{coll}(v_n)$, is obtained by multiplying $f(v_n)$ by the collision probability factor $v_n$ (for approaching pairs, $v_n > 0$):\n$$\nf_{coll}(v_n) \\propto v_n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu v_n^2}{2k_B T}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } v_n > 0\n$$\nWe are asked to find the probability distribution of the normal component of energy, $E_n = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu v_n^2$. We perform a change of variables. From the energy expression, we have $v_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E_n}{\\mu}}$ and the differential relationship $dE_n = \\mu v_n dv_n$, which implies $dv_n = \\frac{dE_n}{\\mu v_n}$.\n\nLet $P(E_n)dE_n$ be the probability that a collision occurs with the normal energy component between $E_n$ and $E_n+dE_n$. This probability is proportional to $f_{coll}(v_n)dv_n$. Substituting the expressions for $v_n$ and $dv_n$:\n$$\nP(E_n)dE_n \\propto v_n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_n}{k_B T}\\right) \\left(\\frac{dE_n}{\\mu v_n}\\right)\n$$\nThe $v_n$ terms cancel, leaving a remarkably simple form:\n$$\nP(E_n)dE_n \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_n}{k_B T}\\right) dE_n\n$$\nTo find the normalized probability distribution, we introduce a normalization constant $C$ and integrate from $E_n=0$ to $E_n=\\infty$:\n$$\n\\int_0^{\\infty} C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_n}{k_B T}\\right) dE_n = C \\left[-k_B T \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_n}{k_B T}\\right)\\right]_0^{\\infty} = C(0 - (-k_B T)) = C k_B T = 1\n$$\nThus, the normalization constant is $C = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$, and the probability distribution is:\n$$\nP(E_n) = \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_n}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the probability distribution of the normal component of the relative translational energy among collisions.\n\nNext, we derive the fraction of collisions, $F$, for which this energy exceeds the threshold $E_0$. This fraction is the integral of the distribution from $E_0$ to infinity:\n$$\nF = \\int_{E_0}^{\\infty} P(E_n) dE_n = \\int_{E_0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_n}{k_B T}\\right) dE_n\n$$\n$$\nF = \\left[-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_n}{k_B T}\\right)\\right]_{E_0}^{\\infty} = 0 - \\left(-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_0}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_0}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem provides molar energy $E_0$ and the molar gas constant $R$. We use the relationship $R = N_A k_B$, where $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant. The exponent can be rewritten for molar quantities:\n$$\n\\frac{E_0 (\\text{per mole})}{RT} = \\frac{N_A E_0 (\\text{per molecule})}{N_A k_B T} = \\frac{E_0 (\\text{per molecule})}{k_B T}\n$$\nSo the expression for the fraction $F$ in terms of molar quantities is:\n$$\nF = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_0}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nFinally, we must calculate the temperature $T$ for the given conditions.\nThe givens are:\n- Fraction of effective collisions, $F = 0.01$\n- Threshold energy, $E_0 = 25 \\, \\text{kJ mol}^{-1} = 25000 \\, \\text{J mol}^{-1}$\n- Molar gas constant, $R = 8.314 \\, \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}$\n\nWe set up the equation:\n$$\n0.01 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25000}{8.314 \\times T}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $T$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(0.01) = -\\frac{25000}{8.314 \\times T}\n$$\nRearranging the equation for $T$:\n$$\nT = -\\frac{25000}{8.314 \\times \\ln(0.01)}\n$$\nSince $\\ln(0.01) = \\ln(10^{-2}) = -2\\ln(10)$, and we can also write this as $\\ln(0.01) = -\\ln(100)$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{25000}{8.314 \\times \\ln(100)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the values:\n$$\nT = \\frac{25000}{8.314 \\times 4.6051701859...}\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{25000}{38.2924036...}\n$$\n$$\nT = 652.8833... \\, \\text{K}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $T = 652.9 \\, \\text{K}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{652.9} $$", "id": "2929177"}, {"introduction": "While the rate of most elementary reactions increases with temperature, the observed rate of an overall multi-step process can sometimes decrease.
