While including these intermediates is crucial for describing the mechanism accurately, their fleeting nature often makes a full analytical solution of the kinetic equations intractable.

Your final reported answer must be the single closed-form expression for the dimensionless normalized initial rate. Do not evaluate numerically. No unit specification is required for the reported dimensionless quantity.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in chemical kinetics that is free of logical contradictions or incomplete data. Therefore, a solution is warranted.\n\nThe reaction mechanism is given by two elementary steps:\n$$A + B \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} I$$\n$$I \\stackrel{k_2}{\\longrightarrow} P$$\nThe system is a well-mixed, isothermal, constant-volume batch reactor. The Law of Mass Action is assumed to apply. The initial conditions are $[A](0) = [A]_0$, $[B](0) = [B]_0$, $[I](0) = 0$, and $[P](0) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we write the rate equations for the concentrations of all species involved. The rate of change for each concentration, denoted by $[X]$, is given by $\\frac{d[X]}{dt}$.\nThe rate equation for the intermediate species $I$ is:\n$$\\frac{d[I]}{dt} = k_1 [A] [B] - k_{-1} [I] - k_2 [I] = k_1 [A] [B] - (k_{-1} + k_2) [I]$$\nThe rate of formation of the product $P$, denoted as $r_P(t)$, is:\n$$r_P(t) \\equiv \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_2 [I]$$\n\nThe problem requires the use of the steady-state approximation (SSA) for the intermediate $I$. This approximation assumes that the concentration of the highly reactive intermediate $I$ changes very slowly relative to its rates of formation and consumption. Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\frac{d[I]}{dt} \\approx 0$.\nApplying the SSA to the rate equation for $[I]$:\n$$k_1 [A] [B] - (k_{-1} + k_2) [I]_{ss} \\approx 0$$\nHere, $[I]_{ss}$ denotes the steady-state concentration of the intermediate. Solving for $[I]_{ss}$, we obtain an algebraic expression for the intermediate's concentration in terms of the reactant concentrations:\n$$[I]_{ss} = \\frac{k_1 [A] [B]}{k_{-1} + k_2}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $[I]_{ss}$ into the rate equation for the product $P$ to find the rate of product formation, $r_P(t)$, under the steady-state assumption:\n$$r_P(t) = k_2 [I]_{ss} = k_2 \\left( \\frac{k_1 [A] [B]}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\right) = \\frac{k_1 k_2 [A] [B]}{k_{-1} + k_2}$$\nThis expression gives the rate of product formation in terms of the instantaneous concentrations of reactants $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe next step is to specialize this result to the initial-rate regime. This regime corresponds to the time immediately after the reaction begins, $t \\rightarrow 0^+$. In this short time window, the concentrations of the reactants have not changed appreciably from their initial values. Thus, we can make the substitutions $[A](t) \\approx [A](0) = [A]_0$ and $[B](t) \\approx [B](0) = [B]_0$.\nApplying this to the expression for $r_P(t)$, we find the initial rate of product formation, $r_P(0^+)$:\n$$r_P(0^+) = \\frac{k_1 k_2 [A]_0 [B]_0}{k_{-1} + k_2}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless normalized initial rate, which is defined as $\\frac{r_P(0^+)}{k_1 [A]_0 [B]_0}$. We compute this quantity:\n$$\\frac{r_P(0^+)}{k_1 [A]_0 [B]_0} = \\frac{1}{k_1 [A]_0 [B]_0} \\left( \\frac{k_1 k_2 [A]_0 [B]_0}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\right)$$\nUpon cancellation of terms, we arrive at the final expression:\n$$\\frac{r_P(0^+)}{k_1 [A]_0 [B]_0} = \\frac{k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2}$$\n\nFinally, we must justify the conditions under which the steady-state approximation and the initial-rate approximation are self-consistent. The consistency of these two approximations relies on a separation of timescales. The intermediate $I$ must relax to its steady-state concentration on a timescale, $\\tau_I$, that is much shorter than the timescale, $\\tau_R$, over which the reactant concentrations $[A]$ and $[B]$ are depleted.\nThe characteristic relaxation time for $[I]$ can be identified from its rate equation, $\\frac{d[I]}{dt} + (k_{-1} + k_2)[I] = k_1[A][B]$. This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $[I]$ if $[A]$ and $[B]$ are treated as constant. The time constant is $\\tau_I = (k_{-1} + k_2)^{-1}$.\nThe characteristic time for reactant consumption, for example $[A]$, is given by $\\tau_{R,A} \\approx \\frac{[A]_0}{|\\frac{d[A]}{dt}|_{t=0^+}}$. The net rate of consumption of $A$ and $B$ results in the formation of $P$, so $|\\frac{d[A]}{dt}|_{t=0^+} = r_P(0^+) = \\frac{k_1 k_2 [A]_0 [B]_0}{k_{-1} + k_2}$.\nThus, $\\tau_{R,A} \\approx \\frac{[A]_0}{\\frac{k_1 k_2 [A]_0 [B]_0}{k_{-1} + k_2}} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1 k_2 [B]_0}$.\nSimilarly, $\\tau_{R,B} \\approx \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1 k_2 [A]_0}$.\n\nThe condition for self-consistency is $\\tau_I \\ll \\tau_R$. Applying this to $\\tau_{R,A}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\ll \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1 k_2 [B]_0} \\implies k_1 k_2 [B]_0 \\ll (k_{-1} + k_2)^2$$\nA more direct and physically intuitive justification, as suggested by the problem, is based on the requirement that the steady-state concentration of the intermediate, $[I]_{ss}$, must be much smaller than the concentrations of the reactants. At $t \\to 0^+$:\n$$[I]_{ss,0} = \\frac{k_1 [A]_0 [B]_0}{k_{-1} + k_2}$$\nThe conditions for the validity of the SSA are $[I]_{ss,0} \\ll [A]_0$ and $[I]_{ss,0} \\ll [B]_0$.\nFrom $[I]_{ss,0} \\ll [A]_0$:\n$$\\frac{k_1 [A]_0 [B]_0}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\ll [A]_0 \\implies \\frac{k_1 [B]_0}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\ll 1$$\nFrom $[I]_{ss,0} \\ll [B]_0$:\n$$\\frac{k_1 [A]_0 [B]_0}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\ll [B]_0 \\implies \\frac{k_1 [A]_0}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\ll 1$$\nThese two conditions, $k_1 [B]_0 \\ll k_{-1} + k_2$ and $k_1 [A]_0 \\ll k_{-1} + k_2$, ensure that the rate of consumption of the intermediate $I$ is much faster than its rate of formation. This guarantees that $[I]$ remains at a low concentration and reaches a quasi-steady state rapidly before the reactant concentrations $[A]$ and $[B]$ can change significantly, thus validating both the SSA and the initial-rate measurement simultaneously. These conditions are sufficient and more stringent than the timescale comparison, as they imply $k_1 k_2 [B]_0 / (k_{-1} + k_2)^2 = (\\frac{k_1 [B]_0}{k_{-1} + k_2}) (\\frac{k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2}) \\ll 1$ since $\\frac{k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\le 1$.\n\nThe required final answer is the derived closed-form analytic expression for the dimensionless normalized initial rate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2}}$$", "id": "2954093"}, {"introduction": "While the steady-state approximation is powerful, its validity is not universal, and a key skill for any kineticist is developing an intuition for the conditions under which such approximations hold.
