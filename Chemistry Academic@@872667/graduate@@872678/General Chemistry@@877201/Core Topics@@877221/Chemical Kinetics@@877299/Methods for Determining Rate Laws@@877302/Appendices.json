The first measured point $(t_{m} = 1.5 \\,\\mathrm{ms}, [A] = 100 \\,\\mathrm{\\mu M})$ corresponds to a corrected reaction time of $t = t_m - t_d = 0 \\,\\mathrm{s}$ and a concentration that matches the given initial condition $[A]_0$. The problem is therefore deemed valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe tasks will be addressed in the specified order.\n\nTask 1: Time axis correction.\nThe reaction time $t$ is defined as $t = t_{m} - t_{d}$. We will use SI units throughout.\n$[A]_{0} = 100\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n$t_{d} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe first three data points relevant for the subsequent tasks are corrected as follows:\n- Data point 0: $t_{m} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{ms} \\implies t_0 = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} - 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} = 0\\,\\mathrm{s}$. $[A]_0 = 100\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n- Data point 1: $t_{m} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{ms} \\implies t_1 = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} - 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$. $[A]_1 = 90.9091\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M} = 9.09091 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n- Data point 2: $t_{m} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{ms} \\implies t_2 = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3} - 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$. $[A]_2 = 80.0000\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nTask 2: Integration of rate laws.\nFor the first-order model, we integrate the differential rate law:\n$$-\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k_{1} [A]$$\n$$\\int_{[A]_{0}}^{[A](t)} \\frac{d[A]}{[A]} = -\\int_{0}^{t} k_{1} dt'$$\n$$\\ln([A](t)) - \\ln([A]_{0}) = -k_{1}t$$\n$$[A](t) = [A]_{0} \\exp(-k_{1}t)$$\n\nFor the second-order model, we integrate its differential rate law:\n$$-\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k_{2} [A]^{2}$$\n$$\\int_{[A]_{0}}^{[A](t)} \\frac{d[A]}{[A]^{2}} = -\\int_{0}^{t} k_{2} dt'$$\n$$\\left[ -\\frac{1}{[A]} \\right]_{[A]_{0}}^{[A](t)} = -k_{2}t$$\n$$-\\frac{1}{[A](t)} + \\frac{1}{[A]_{0}} = -k_{2}t$$\n$$\\frac{1}{[A](t)} = \\frac{1}{[A]_{0}} + k_{2}t$$\nThis can be rearranged to give $[A](t)$ explicitly:\n$$[A](t) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{[A]_{0}} + k_{2}t} = \\frac{[A]_{0}}{1 + k_{2}t[A]_{0}}$$\n\nTask 3: Determination of rate constants.\nWe use the first two corrected data points, $(t_0, [A]_0)$ and $(t_1, [A]_1)$, where $t_0=0$. The integrated forms already satisfy the condition at $t_0$. We use the point at $t_1$ to find the constants.\n\nFor the first-order constant $k_{1}$:\n$$k_{1} = -\\frac{1}{t_{1}} \\ln\\left( \\frac{[A]_{1}}{[A]_{0}} \\right)$$\n$$k_{1} = -\\frac{1}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}} \\ln\\left( \\frac{9.09091 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{M}} \\right)$$\n$$k_{1} = -1000 \\ln(0.909091) \\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} \\approx -1000(-0.09531) \\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 95.31 \\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n\nFor the second-order constant $k_{2}$:\n$$k_{2} = \\frac{1}{t_{1}} \\left( \\frac{1}{[A]_{1}} - \\frac{1}{[A]_{0}} \\right)$$\n$$k_{2} = \\frac{1}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}} \\left( \\frac{1}{9.09091 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}} - \\frac{1}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{M}} \\right)$$\nThe term $9.09091$ is numerically equivalent to $\\frac{100}{11}$. So, $[A]_{1} = \\frac{100}{11} \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M} = \\frac{1}{11} \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$. This gives $\\frac{1}{[A]_{1}} = 11 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}}$.\n$$k_{2} = \\frac{1}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}} (11000\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}} - 10000\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}})$$\n$$k_{2} = \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6} \\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}$$\n\nTask 4: Model validation with the third data point.\nWe predict the concentration at $t_2 = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$ for each model and compare it to the measured value $[A]_{2,meas} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFirst-order prediction, $[A]_{pred,1}$:\n$$[A]_{pred,1} = [A]_{0} \\exp(-k_{1}t_{2}) = (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{M}) \\exp(-95.31\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s})$$\n$$[A]_{pred,1} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{M}) \\exp(-0.238275) \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{M})(0.78799) = 7.8799 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe squared residual for the first-order model is:\n$$R_{1}^{2} = ([A]_{2,meas} - [A]_{pred,1})^{2} = (8.0 \\times 10^{-5} - 7.8799 \\times 10^{-5})^{2}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{2}$$\n$$R_{1}^{2} = (1.201 \\times 10^{-6})^{2}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{2} \\approx 1.44 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{2}$$\n\nSecond-order prediction, $[A]_{pred,2}$:\n$$[A]_{pred,2} = \\frac{[A]_{0}}{1 + k_{2}t_{2}[A]_{0}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{M}}{1 + (1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}})(2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s})(1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{M})}$$\n$$[A]_{pred,2} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{M}}{1 + 0.25} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{1.25}\\,\\mathrm{M} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe squared residual for the second-order model is:\n$$R_{2}^{2} = ([A]_{2,meas} - [A]_{pred,2})^{2} = (8.0 \\times 10^{-5} - 8.0 \\times 10^{-5})^{2}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{2} = 0$$\n\nSince $R_{2}^{2} = 0$ and $R_{1}^{2} > 0$, the second-order model provides a perfect fit for the third data point, while the first-order model shows a non-negligible deviation. Therefore, the second-order model is unequivocally superior in describing the early-time data.\n\nTask 5: Report the value of $k_{2}$.\nThe value of the second-order rate constant obtained is $k_{2} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6} \\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n\n$$k_{2} = 1.000 \\times 10^{6} \\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.000 \\times 10^{6}}$$", "id": "2946138"}]}
