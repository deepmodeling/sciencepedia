I will validate the problem first and then proceed to the solution by a systematic derivation from first principles.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n- **Reaction:** A single-reactant, isothermal, constant-volume decomposition $A \\rightarrow \\text{products}$.\n- **Rate Law:** $-\\dfrac{d[A]}{dt} = k [A]^n$, with rate constant $k>0$.\n- **Reaction Order:** The order $n$ is an integer, $n \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n- **Conditions:** No reverse reaction, no side reactions.\n- **Initial Condition:** Concentration at $t=0$ is $[A]_0$.\n- **Definition of Half-Life:** $[A](t_{1/2}) = \\dfrac{[A]_0}{2}$.\n- **Objective:** For both $n=1$ and $n=2$, identify the correct linearizing plot (transformed ordinate vs. $t$), the corresponding slope in terms of $k$, and the dependence of $t_{1/2}$ on $[A]_0$.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it is based on the fundamental principles of chemical kinetics. The rate law $-\\dfrac{d[A]}{dt} = k [A]^n$ is a cornerstone of the field. The provided conditions (isothermal, constant volume, no side reactions) are standard simplifying assumptions for deriving integrated rate laws. The problem is well-posed; it asks for the derivation of standard, unique results for elementary reaction orders. The language is objective and precise. All necessary information is provided, and there are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve the differential rate law for the specified integer orders $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n\n**Case 1: First-Order Reaction ($n=1$)**\n\nThe rate law is given by:\n$$-\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k[A]$$\nThis is a separable first-order differential equation. We rearrange the terms to separate the variables $[A]$ and $t$:\n$$\\frac{d[A]}{[A]} = -k \\, dt$$\nNext, we integrate both sides. The concentration ranges from the initial value $[A]_0$ at time $t=0$ to $[A]$ at time $t$.\n$$\\int_{[A]_0}^{[A]} \\frac{1}{[A']} \\, d[A'] = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt'$$\nPerforming the definite integration yields:\n$$[\\ln[A']]_{[A]_0}^{[A]} = [-kt']_0^t$$\n$$\\ln[A] - \\ln[A]_0 = -kt$$\nThis equation is the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction. To identify the linear plot, we rearrange it into the form of a linear equation, $y=mx+b$:\n$$\\ln[A] = -kt + \\ln[A]_0$$\nFrom this form, it is evident that a plot of $y = \\ln[A]$ versus $x = t$ will produce a straight line.\n- **Linearizing Plot:** $\\ln[A]$ versus $t$.\n- **Slope:** The slope of this line is $m = -k$. As $k>0$ is given, the slope is negative.\n\nTo find the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, we use its definition: at $t = t_{1/2}$, $[A] = [A]_0/2$. Substituting this into the integrated rate law:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{[A]_0}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2} + \\ln[A]_0$$\n$$\\ln[A]_0 - \\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2} + \\ln[A]_0$$\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}$$\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$$\n- **Half-Life Dependence:** The expression for $t_{1/2}$ does not contain the term $[A]_0$. Therefore, the half-life of a first-order reaction is independent of the initial concentration.\n\n**Case 2: Second-Order Reaction ($n=2$)**\n\nThe rate law is:\n$$-\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k[A]^2$$\nAgain, this is a separable differential equation. We rearrange and integrate:\n$$\\frac{d[A]}{[A]^2} = -k \\, dt$$\n$$\\int_{[A]_0}^{[A]} [A']^{-2} \\, d[A'] = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt'$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\\left[-\\frac{1}{[A']}\\right]_{[A]_0}^{[A]} = [-kt']_0^t$$\n$$-\\frac{1}{[A]} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{[A]_0}\\right) = -kt$$\n$$\\frac{1}{[A]_0} - \\frac{1}{[A]} = -kt$$\nTo achieve the linear form $y=mx+b$, we rearrange:\n$$\\frac{1}{[A]} = kt + \\frac{1}{[A]_0}$$\nThis equation shows that a plot of $y = 1/[A]$ versus $x = t$ will be a straight line.\n- **Linearizing Plot:** $1/[A]$ versus $t$.\n- **Slope:** The slope of this line is $m = +k$. As $k>0$, the slope is positive.\n\nTo find the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, we substitute $[A] = [A]_0/2$ at $t = t_{1/2}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{[A]_0/2} = k t_{1/2} + \\frac{1}{[A]_0}$$\n$$\\frac{2}{[A]_0} = k t_{1/2} + \\frac{1}{[A]_0}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{[A]_0} = k t_{1/2}$$\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{1}{k[A]_0}$$\n- **Half-Life Dependence:** The half-life for a second-order reaction is inversely proportional to the initial concentration, $t_{1/2} \\propto 1/[A]_0$. Consequently, if the initial concentration is changed from $[A]_0$ to $f[A]_0$, the new half-life will be scaled by a factor of $1/f$.\n\n### Option Evaluation\n\nI will now evaluate each option against these derived results.\n\n**A.** First-order: plot $\\ln [A]$ versus $t$; slope $-k$. This is correct. Second-order: plot $1/[A]$ versus $t$; slope $-k$. This is incorrect; the slope must be $+k$. Half-life: independent for both orders. This is incorrect for the second-order case.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B.** First-order: plot $[A]$ versus $t$. This is incorrect; this plot is linear for a zero-order reaction, not first-order. Second-order: plot $1/[A]$ versus $t$; slope $+k$. This is correct. Half-life: independent for both orders. This is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** First-order: plot $\\ln [A]$ versus $t$; slope $-k$. This is correct. Second-order: plot $1/[A]$ versus $t$; slope $+k$. This is correct. Half-life: for first-order, $t_{1/2}$ is independent of $[A]_0$; for second-order, $t_{1/2} \\propto 1/[A]_0$. This is correct. All parts of this option are consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D.** This option incorrectly swaps the kinetic characteristics of first-order and second-order reactions. The plot for first-order is given as $1/[A]$ vs $t$, and for second-order as $\\ln[A]$ vs $t$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E.** First-order: plot $\\log_{10}[A]$ versus $t$; slope $-k$. This is incorrect. A plot of $\\log_{10}[A]$ versus $t$ is indeed linear, but its slope is not $-k$. Using the relation $\\ln[A] = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}[A]$, the integrated rate law becomes $\\ln(10) \\log_{10}[A] = -kt + \\ln(10) \\log_{10}[A]_0$. This gives $\\log_{10}[A] = (-k/\\ln(10))t + \\log_{10}[A]_0$. The slope is $-k/\\ln(10)$, or approximately $-k/2.303$, not $-k$. The remainder of the option is correct, but this first part renders it invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the kinetics for both reaction orders is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2942179"}, {"introduction": "While many reactions slow down as reactants are consumed, some proceed at a constant rate, independent of concentration.

The problem is valid and a rigorous solution will be presented.\n\nThe reaction is a zero-order decomposition of reactant $A$. The rate of reaction, which is the negative of the rate of change of concentration of $A$, is independent of the concentration of $A$. The differential rate law is thus given by:\n$$\n-\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k[A]^0 = k\n$$\nwhere $[A]$ is the concentration of species $A$ at time $t$, and $k$ is the zero-order rate constant.\n\nTo find the integrated rate law, which relates concentration to time, we must integrate this differential equation. We rearrange the equation to separate variables:\n$$\nd[A] = -k \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state (at $t=0$, the concentration is $[A]_0$) to an arbitrary state at time $t$ (where the concentration is $[A](t)$):\n$$\n\\int_{[A]_0}^{[A](t)} d[A] = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt\n$$\nSince $k$ is a constant under isothermal conditions, the integration yields:\n$$\n[A](t) - [A]_0 = -k(t - 0)\n$$\nThis gives the integrated rate law for a zero-order reaction:\n$$\n[A](t) = [A]_0 - kt\n$$\n\nNext, we are asked to find a general expression for the time $t_f$ required for the concentration of $A$ to reach a fixed fraction $f$ of its initial value, $[A]_0$. At time $t_f$, the concentration is $[A](t_f) = f[A]_0$, where $0 < f < 1$. We substitute this condition into the integrated rate law:\n$$\nf[A]_0 = [A]_0 - kt_f\n$$\nWe now solve for $t_f$:\n$$\nkt_f = [A]_0 - f[A]_0\n$$\n$$\nkt_f = [A]_0 (1 - f)\n$$\nThus, the general expression for $t_f$ is:\n$$\nt_f = \\frac{[A]_0 (1 - f)}{k}\n$$\n\nWe must now evaluate this time for the specific case where $f = 0.25$, using the provided nominal parameters: $[A]_0 = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{M}$ and $k = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M\\,s^{-1}}$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $t_f$:\n$$\nt_{0.25} = \\frac{(0.020\\,\\mathrm{M})(1 - 0.25)}{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M\\,s^{-1}}}\n$$\n$$\nt_{0.25} = \\frac{(0.020)(0.75)}{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\nt_{0.25} = \\frac{0.015}{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}}\\,\\mathrm{s} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe inputs $[A]_0$ and $k$ are given to two significant figures, so the result must also be expressed to two significant figures. The calculated time is $1000\\,\\mathrm{s}$, which is written as $1.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{s}$ to correctly represent the precision.\n\nFinally, we must assess the feasibility of reaching $f=0.25$ if $k$ has a relative uncertainty of $\\pm 0.10$. Feasibility is defined by whether the target is reached before the reactant is completely depleted. Complete depletion occurs when $[A](t) = 0$. Let this time be $t_{complete}$. From the integrated rate law, $0 = [A]_0 - kt_{complete}$, which gives:\n$$\nt_{complete} = \\frac{[A]_0}{k}\n$$\nThe condition for feasibility is that the time to reach fraction $f$, $t_f$, must be less than the time for complete depletion, $t_{complete}$.\n$$\nt_f < t_{complete}\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expressions:\n$$\n\\frac{[A]_0(1 - f)}{k} < \\frac{[A]_0}{k}\n$$\nSince the initial concentration $[A]_0$ and the rate constant $k$ are positive quantities, we can multiply both sides by $\\frac{k}{[A]_0}$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n1 - f < 1\n$$\nThis simplifies to $-f < 0$, or $f > 0$. The problem statement specifies that $0 < f < 1$, which means the condition $f > 0$ is inherently satisfied. Therefore, reaching any fractional concentration $f$ within this range is always physically feasible, as it will always occur before the reactant is completely consumed. This conclusion is a direct mathematical consequence of the zero-order model and is independent of the specific value of $k$. The uncertainty in $k$ will affect the numerical values of both $t_f$ and $t_{complete}$, but it will not alter the logical fact that $t_f < t_{complete}$.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in chemical kinetics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from the fundamental definitions. We first express the concentration of reactant $\\mathrm{A}$, denoted $[A]$, in terms of the fractional conversion, $X$. The definition is:\n$$X = \\frac{[A]_{0} - [A]}{[A]_{0}}$$\nRearranging this expression for $[A]$ yields:\n$$[A] = [A]_{0} (1 - X)$$\nTo relate this to the rate law, we must find the time derivative of $[A]$.
