It is well-posed, providing all necessary information (reactants, products, medium) to arrive at a unique solution using the specified standard method. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem is a straightforward, a non-trivial application of fundamental chemical principles. There are no contradictions, missing data, or pseudoscientific elements.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid and solvable.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe task is to balance the given redox reaction in an acidic medium using the half-reaction method. This process involves separating the overall reaction into two half-reactions: one for oxidation and one for reduction.\n\nFirst, we must identify the species being oxidized and reduced by assigning oxidation numbers.\n-   In the dichromate ion, $Cr_2O_7^{2-}$, oxygen has an oxidation number of $-2$. Let the oxidation number of chromium be $x$. The sum of oxidation numbers must equal the charge of the ion, which is $-2$. Thus, $2x + 7(-2) = -2$, which gives $2x - 14 = -2$, or $2x = 12$, so $x = +6$.\n-   In the chromium(III) ion, $Cr^{3+}$, the oxidation number of chromium is $+3$.\n-   In the iodide ion, $I^{-}$, the oxidation number of iodine is $-1$.\n-   In diatomic iodine, $I_2$, the oxidation number of iodine is $0$.\n\nChromium's oxidation number decreases from $+6$ to $+3$; therefore, the dichromate ion is reduced.\nIodine's oxidation number increases from $-1$ to $0$; therefore, the iodide ion is oxidized.\n\nWe now construct and balance each half-reaction.\n\n**Reduction Half-Reaction:** $Cr_2O_7^{2-} \\to Cr^{3+}$\n1.  Balance atoms other than oxygen and hydrogen. There are two $Cr$ atoms on the left, so we need two on the right:\n    $$\n    Cr_2O_7^{2-} \\to 2Cr^{3+}\n    $$\n2.  Balance oxygen atoms by adding water molecules, $H_2O$. There are seven $O$ atoms on the left, so we add seven $H_2O$ molecules to the right:\n    $$\n    Cr_2O_7^{2-} \\to 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O\n    $$\n3.  Balance hydrogen atoms by adding hydrogen ions, $H^+$, as the solution is acidic. There are $7 \\times 2 = 14$ hydrogen atoms on the right, so we add fourteen $H^+$ ions to the left:\n    $$\n    14H^+ + Cr_2O_7^{2-} \\to 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O\n    $$\n4.  Balance the charge by adding electrons, $e^-$. The total charge on the left is $14(+1) + (-2) = +12$. The total charge on the right is $2(+3) + 7(0) = +6$. To balance the charge, we must add $6$ electrons to the left side:\n    $$\n    6e^- + 14H^+ + Cr_2O_7^{2-} \\to 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O\n    $$\nThis half-reaction is now fully balanced. Six electrons are consumed.\n\n**Oxidation Half-Reaction:** $I^{-} \\to I_2$\n1.  Balance atoms other than oxygen and hydrogen. There is one $I$ atom on the left and two on the right, so we place a coefficient of $2$ before $I^{-}$:\n    $$\n    2I^{-} \\to I_2\n    $$\n2.  Oxygen and hydrogen atoms are not present.\n3.  Balance the charge by adding electrons. The total charge on the left is $2(-1) = -2$. The total charge on the right is $0$. To balance the charge, we must add $2$ electrons to the right side:\n    $$\n    2I^{-} \\to I_2 + 2e^-\n    $$\nThis half-reaction is now fully balanced. Two electrons are produced.\n\nNow, we combine the two half-reactions. The number of electrons lost in oxidation must equal the number of electrons gained in reduction. The reduction half-reaction involves $6$ electrons, while the oxidation half-reaction involves $2$ electrons. The least common multiple of $6$ and $2$ is $6$. Therefore, we must multiply the oxidation half-reaction by $3$:\n$$\n3 \\times (2I^{-} \\to I_2 + 2e^-) \\implies 6I^{-} \\to 3I_2 + 6e^-\n$$\nThis explicitly verifies that the $6$ electrons produced by the oxidation of iodide are equal to the $6$ electrons consumed by the reduction of dichromate.\n\nWe now add the balanced reduction half-reaction and the scaled, balanced oxidation half-reaction:\n$$\n(6e^- + 14H^+ + Cr_2O_7^{2-} \\to 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O) \\\\\n+ (6I^{-} \\to 3I_2 + 6e^-)\n$$\nSumming these gives:\n$$\n6e^- + 14H^+ + Cr_2O_7^{2-} + 6I^{-} \\to 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O + 3I_2 + 6e^-\n$$\nFinally, we cancel the species that appear on both sides of the equation, which are the $6$ electrons:\n$$\n14H^+ + Cr_2O_7^{2-} + 6I^{-} \\to 2Cr^{3+} + 3I_2 + 7H_2O\n$$\nThis is the fully balanced net ionic equation with the smallest whole-number stoichiometric coefficients.\n\nLet us verify the balance of atoms and charge in the final equation.\n-   Atoms:\n    -   $H$: $14$ on the left, $7 \\times 2 = 14$ on the right.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to balance the given redox reaction using the half-reaction method in a basic medium.\n\nFirst, we determine the oxidation numbers of the elements undergoing changes to identify the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.\nFor the nitrite ion, $\\mathrm{NO_2^-}$, the oxidation number of oxygen is $-2$. Let the oxidation number of nitrogen be $x$. The sum must equal the charge of the ion, $-1$. Thus, $x + 2(-2) = -1$, which gives $x = +3$.\nFor ammonia, $\\mathrm{NH_3}$, the oxidation number of hydrogen is $+1$. Let the oxidation number of nitrogen be $y$. The sum must equal the charge of the molecule, $0$. Thus, $y + 3(+1) = 0$, which gives $y = -3$.\nThe oxidation number of nitrogen decreases from $+3$ to $-3$, so the conversion of $\\mathrm{NO_2^-}$ to $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ is the reduction half-reaction.\n\nFor metallic aluminum, $\\mathrm{Al}$, its oxidation number in the elemental state is $0$.\nFor the tetrahydroxoaluminate ion, $\\mathrm{Al(OH)_4^-}$, each hydroxide group $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ has a charge of $-1$. Let the oxidation number of aluminum be $z$. The sum must equal the charge of the ion, $-1$. Thus, $z + 4(-1) = -1$, which gives $z = +3$.\nThe oxidation number of aluminum increases from $0$ to $+3$, so the conversion of $\\mathrm{Al}$ to $\\mathrm{Al(OH)_4^-}$ is the oxidation half-reaction.\n\nWe will balance each half-reaction separately.\n\nReduction Half-Reaction: $\\mathrm{NO_2^- \\to NH_3}$\n$1.$ Balance atoms other than oxygen and hydrogen.

We construct the augmented matrix for this system, $[A|\\mathbf{0}]$.\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cccccc|c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & -4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2 & 1 & -3 & -4 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\nWe now perform Gauss-Jordan elimination to find the Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) of this matrix.\n\n$R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 - 2R_1$ and $R_5 \\leftarrow R_5 + R_1$:\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cccccc|c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & -4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2 & 1 & -3 & -4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\n$R_4 \\leftarrow R_4 - 2R_3$:\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cccccc|c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & -4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & -7 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\n$R_5 \\leftarrow R_5 - R_4$:\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cccccc|c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & -4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & -7 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 6 & -3 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\nNormalize the pivot rows. $R_4 \\leftarrow -R_4$ and $R_5 \\leftarrow \\frac{1}{6}R_5$.\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cccccc|c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & -4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 7 & -4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\nNow, eliminate the non-zero entries above the pivots (backward elimination).\n$R_1 \\leftarrow R_1 + R_5$, $R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 - 2R_5$, $R_4 \\leftarrow R_4 - 7R_5$:\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cccccc|c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & -3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\n$R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 - R_4$:\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cccccc|c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -\\frac{5}{2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\nThis matrix is in RREF.
