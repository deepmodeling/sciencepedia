It presents a standard problem in dimensional analysis within the context of general chemistry. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is free of contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to convert a given mass concentration, $C_{mass} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{mg\\ L^{-1}}$, into an amount concentration, $C_{amount}$, expressed in the coherent SI base unit form of $\\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$. This conversion will be performed in terms of the solute's molar mass, $M$, which is given in units of $\\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}}$. The derivation will rely exclusively on dimensional analysis, applying a series of conversion factors derived from fundamental definitions.\n\nThe initial concentration is given as:\n$$\nC_{mass} = 5.0\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}}\n$$\nWe must convert the mass unit in the numerator from milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$) to amount of substance in moles ($\\mathrm{mol}$), and the volume unit in the denominator from liters ($\\mathrm{L}$) to cubic meters ($\\mathrm{m}^3$). This can be accomplished by multiplying the initial value by a chain of conversion factors, each of which is equivalent to the number $1$.\n\nThe required conversion factors are as follows:\n\n1.  **Mass Conversion from Milligrams to Grams**: The SI prefix 'milli-' (m) represents a factor of $10^{-3}$. The relationship between milligrams and grams is therefore $1\\ \\mathrm{mg} = 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{g}$. To convert from milligrams, we construct the conversion factor:\n    $$\n    \\frac{10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{g}}{1\\ \\mathrm{mg}} = 1\n    $$\n\n2.  **Conversion from Mass to Amount of Substance**: The amount of substance, $n$ (in $\\mathrm{mol}$), is related to its mass, $m$ (in $\\mathrm{g}$), and its molar mass, $M$ (in $\\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}}$), by the fundamental equation $n = \\frac{m}{M}$. This provides a substance-specific conversion factor between mass and moles:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{mol}}{M\\ \\mathrm{g}} = 1\n    $$\n\n3.  **Volume Conversion from Liters to Cubic Meters**: The liter ($\\mathrm{L}$) is a non-SI unit for volume, defined as $1\\ \\mathrm{L} = 1\\ \\mathrm{dm}^3$. The SI prefix 'deci-' (d) represents a factor of $10^{-1}$, so $1\\ \\mathrm{dm} = 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{m}$. The relationship between liters and cubic meters is therefore:\n    $$\n    1\\ \\mathrm{L} = (1\\ \\mathrm{dm})^3 = (10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{m})^3 = 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}^3\n    $$\n    Since the liter unit is in the denominator of the concentration expression, we need the reciprocal conversion factor, which is also equal to $1$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{L}}{10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}^3} = 1\n    $$\n\nNow, we construct the full conversion expression by multiplying the initial concentration by these three factors:\n$$\nC_{amount} = \\left( 5.0\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{g}}{1\\ \\mathrm{mg}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{mol}}{M\\ \\mathrm{g}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{L}}{10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}^3} \\right)\n$$\nTo verify the correctness of this construction, we first analyze the cancellation of units:\n$$\n\\frac{\\cancel{\\mathrm{mg}}}{\\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} \\times \\frac{\\cancel{\\mathrm{g}}}{\\cancel{\\mathrm{mg}}} \\times \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\cancel{\\mathrm{g}}} \\times \\frac{\\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}}{\\mathrm{m}^3} = \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{m}^3}\n$$\nThe units cancel to yield the desired units of $\\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$, confirming the dimensional correctness of the setup.\n\nNext, we evaluate the numerical and symbolic components of the expression:\n$$\nC_{amount} = 5.0 \\times \\frac{10^{-3}}{1} \\times \\frac{1}{M} \\times \\frac{1}{10^{-3}}\n$$\nWe group the numerical terms and the symbolic term $M$:\n$$\nC_{amount} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 1}{M \\times 10^{-3}}\n$$\nThe powers of $10$ are simplified using the property of exponents $a^x / a^x = 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{10^{-3}}{10^{-3}} = 10^{-3 - (-3)} = 10^0 = 1\n$$\nThe expression simplifies to:\n$$\nC_{amount} = \\frac{5.0}{M}\n$$\nThus, the concentration of $5.0 \\mathrm{mg\\ L}^{-1}$ is equivalent to $\\frac{5.0}{M} \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$, where $M$ is the molar mass in $\\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}}$. This result stems from the fact that the conversion factor from $\\mathrm{mg}$ to $\\mathrm{g}$ ($10^{-3}$) is exactly cancelled by the conversion factor from $\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ to $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ ($1/10^{-3}$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5.0}{M}}$$", "id": "2955644"}, {"introduction": "Building upon direct unit conversion, the next challenge involves deriving the mathematical relationships between different concentration scales from their fundamental definitions.
