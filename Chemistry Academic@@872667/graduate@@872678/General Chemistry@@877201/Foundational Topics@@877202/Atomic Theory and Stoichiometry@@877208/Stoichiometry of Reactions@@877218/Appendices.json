The coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ must be strictly positive integers. The core principle for balancing a chemical equation is the law of conservation of atoms, which states that the number of atoms of each element must be identical on the reactant and product sides of the equation.\n\nWe can establish a system of linear homogeneous equations by enforcing this principle for each element involved: Iron ($\\text{Fe}$), Sulfur ($\\text{S}$), and Oxygen ($\\text{O}$).\n\n1.  For Iron ($\\text{Fe}$): The number of $\\text{Fe}$ atoms on the left is $a \\times 1$. The number on the right is $c \\times 2$. Thus, we have the equation:\n    $$a = 2c \\implies a - 2c = 0$$\n\n2.  For Sulfur ($\\text{S}$): The number of $\\text{S}$ atoms on the left is $a \\times 2$. The number on the right is $d \\times 1$. Thus, we have the equation:\n    $$2a = d \\implies 2a - d = 0$$\n\n3.  For Oxygen ($\\text{O}$): The number of $\\text{O}$ atoms on the left is $b \\times 2$. The number on the right is $(c \\times 3) + (d \\times 2)$. Thus, we have the equation:\n    $$2b = 3c + 2d \\implies 2b - 3c - 2d = 0$$\n\nThese three equations form a system of linear homogeneous equations in the four unknown variables $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We can represent this system in matrix form, $M\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$, where $\\mathbf{x}$ is the vector of coefficients $(a, b, c, d)^T$. To do this, we rearrange the equations to have all terms on one side:\n\\begin{align*}\n    1a + 0b - 2c + 0d = 0 \\\\\n    2a + 0b + 0c - 1d = 0 \\\\\n    0a + 2b - 3c - 2d = 0\n\\end{align*}\nThe matrix $M$, which can be described as the element-by-species matrix for this reaction balance problem, is:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  -2  0 \\\\ 2  0  0  -1 \\\\ 0  2  -3  -2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe vector of unknowns is $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}$. The problem of finding the stoichiometric coefficients is now equivalent to finding a non-zero integer vector $\\mathbf{x}$ in the null space (or kernel) of the matrix $M$.\n\nWe find the null space of $M$ by reducing it to row-echelon form using Gaussian elimination.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  -2  0 \\\\ 2  0  0  -1 \\\\ 0  2  -3  -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\xrightarrow{R_2 \\to R_2 - 2R_1} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  -2  0 \\\\ 0  0  4  -1 \\\\ 0  2  -3  -2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo achieve row-echelon form, we swap the second and third rows:\n$$ \\xrightarrow{R_2 \\leftrightarrow R_3} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  -2  0 \\\\ 0  2  -3  -2 \\\\ 0  0  4  -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form. The rank of the matrix $M$ is the number of non-zero rows, which is $3$. The number of variables is $4$. According to the rank-nullity theorem, the dimension of the null space is the number of variables minus the rank of the matrix: $\\dim(\\text{null}(M)) = 4 - 3 = 1$. This proves that the solution space over the rational numbers is one-dimensional, meaning all solutions are scalar multiples of a single basis vector.\n\nWe can find this basis vector by solving the system corresponding to the row-echelon form. Let $d$ be the free variable. We set $d = t$ for some parameter $t$.\nFrom the third row: $4c - d = 0 \\implies 4c = t \\implies c = \\frac{t}{4}$.\nFrom the first row: $a - 2c = 0 \\implies a = 2c = 2\\left(\\frac{t}{4}\\right) = \\frac{t}{2}$.\nFrom the second row: $2b - 3c - 2d = 0 \\implies 2b = 3c + 2d = 3\\left(\\frac{t}{4}\\right) + 2t = \\frac{3t}{4} + \\frac{8t}{4} = \\frac{11t}{4}$.\nThis gives $b = \\frac{11t}{8}$.\n\nThe general solution vector is $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} t/2 \\\\ 11t/8 \\\\ t/4 \\\\ t \\end{pmatrix} = t \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 \\\\ 11/8 \\\\ 1/4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe problem requires the coefficients $a, b, c, d$ to be strictly positive integers. For the components of the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ to be integers, $t$ must be chosen such that $t/2$, $11t/8$, and $t/4$ are all integers. This requires $t$ to be a common multiple of the denominators $2$, $8$, and $4$. The least common multiple is $\\text{lcm}(2, 8, 4) = 8$.\nTherefore, $t$ must be an integer multiple of $8$. We can write $t = 8k$ for some integer $k$.\nSubstituting this into the general solution:\n$$ \\mathbf{x} = 8k \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 \\\\ 11/8 \\\\ 1/4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = k \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 11 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 8 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis demonstrates that the set of all integer solutions (the integer solution space) is a free module of rank $1$ over the integers ($\\mathbb{Z}$), spanned by the basis vector $\\mathbf{v}_0 = (4, 11, 2, 8)^T$. Any integer solution is an integer multiple of $\\mathbf{v}_0$.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal, strictly positive integer solution. This corresponds to setting $k=1$. The resulting vector is $(4, 11, 2, 8)$. To justify that this is the minimal (or primitive) solution, we must show that its components are coprime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is $1$.\n$$ \\text{gcd}(4, 11, 2, 8) $$\nSince $11$ is a prime number and it does not divide $4$, $2$, or $8$, the greatest common divisor of the set must be $1$. Therefore, the vector $(4, 11, 2, 8)$ is a primitive integer vector. It cannot be reduced by dividing all its components by an integer greater than $1$.\n\nThe minimal positive integer coefficients are therefore $a=4$, $b=11$, $c=2$, and $d=8$. The balanced equation is:\n$$4\\,\\text{FeS}_{2} + 11\\,\\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{Fe}_{2}\\text{O}_{3} + 8\\,\\text{SO}_{2}$$\nThe final answer is the row vector of these coefficients.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 4  11  2  8 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2957183"}, {"introduction": "Building on the matrix representation of stoichiometry, this exercise scales up the analysis to a complex, multi-species combustion system.

The system of equations is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1  -1  1  0  0 \\\\\n1  0  -1  1  0 \\\\\n0  -1  0  -1  1 \\\\\n1  1  0  0  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} l_A \\\\ l_B \\\\ l_C \\\\ l_D \\\\ l_E \\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives the following system of linear equations:\n1. $-l_A - l_B + l_C = 0$\n2. $l_A - l_C + l_D = 0$\n3. $-l_B - l_D + l_E = 0$\n4. $l_A + l_B - l_E = 0$\n\nFrom equation (1), $l_C = l_A + l_B$.\nSubstituting into (2), $l_A - (l_A + l_B) + l_D = 0 \\implies l_D = l_B$.\nSubstituting into (3), $-l_B - l_B + l_E = 0 \\implies l_E = 2l_B$.\nSubstituting into (4), we check for consistency: $l_A + l_B - (2l_B) = 0 \\implies l_A - l_B = 0 \\implies l_A = l_B$.\nThus, all components are determined by $l_B$: $l_A = l_B$, $l_C = 2l_B$, $l_D = l_B$, $l_E = 2l_B$.\nSetting the free parameter $l_B=1$ to obtain the simplest integer basis vector, we find $\\boldsymbol{l} = (1, 1, 2, 1, 2)^{\\top}$.\nA basis for $\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{N}^{\\top})$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{N}^{\\top})} = \\left\\{ \n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} \n\\right\\}\n$$\n\nFinally, we provide the physical interpretation of these subspaces.\nThe range $\\mathcal{R}(\\boldsymbol{N})$ is the stoichiometric subspace. The fundamental relation $\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{N} \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ dictates that any infinitesimal change in the vector of species amounts, $\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{n}$, must be a linear combination of the columns of $\\boldsymbol{N}$. Integrating over time, any finite change in composition, $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{n}(t) - \\boldsymbol{n}(t_0)$, must lie within this subspace. Thus, $\\mathcal{R}(\\boldsymbol{N})$ represents the set of all possible changes in the species composition that are achievable through the given reaction network. A non-zero change vector that is orthogonal to this subspace is impossible to achieve.\n\nThe left nullspace $\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{N}^{\\top})$ is the space of conservation laws. Any vector $\\boldsymbol{l} \\in \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{N}^{\\top})$ satisfies $\\boldsymbol{l}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{N} = \\boldsymbol{0}^{\\top}$. Consider the quantity $M = \\boldsymbol{l}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\sum_{i} l_i n_i$. The time rate of change of $M$ is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}M}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\boldsymbol{l}^{\\top} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. In a closed system, changes in species amounts are due only to reactions, so we can write $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\boldsymbol{N}\\boldsymbol{r}(t)$, where $\\boldsymbol{r}(t)$ is the vector of reaction rates. This gives $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}M}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\boldsymbol{l}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{N} \\boldsymbol{r}(t) = \\boldsymbol{0}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{r}(t) = 0$. Therefore, $M$ is a conserved quantity. Each basis vector of $\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{N}^{\\top})$ corresponds to an independent linear combination of species amounts that remains constant over time. For this system, the single conservation law is $n_A + n_B + 2n_C + n_D + 2n_E = \\text{constant}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2957163"}]}
