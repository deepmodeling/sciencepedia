It is a standard problem in nuclear physics based on the Weizsäcker Semi-Empirical Mass Formula,\na well-established model. The premise—finding the most stable isobar by maximizing the binding energy—is a fundamental concept. The problem statement is self-contained and provides all necessary information and constraints. The instruction to maximize $B(A,Z)$ is physically meaningful, as higher binding energy corresponds to a lower nuclear mass and thus greater stability against radioactive decay. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe stability of an isobaric chain with fixed mass number $A$ is determined by the binding energy per nucleon, or more directly, the total binding energy $B(A,Z)$. The most stable isobar is the one that possesses the maximum binding energy, as this corresponds to the minimum mass-energy for the system. The problem requires us to find the atomic number $Z^{\\star}$ that maximizes $B(A,Z)$ for a fixed odd $A$.\n\nThe binding energy is given by the Semi-Empirical Mass Formula. For an odd mass number $A$, the pairing term is $\\delta(A,Z)=0$. The formula becomes:\n$$\nB(A,Z) = a_{v} A - a_{s} A^{2/3} - a_{c} \\frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}} - a_{a} \\frac{(A-2Z)^{2}}{A}\n$$\nTo find the value of $Z$ that maximizes $B(A,Z)$ for a fixed $A$, we treat $Z$ as a continuous variable and compute the derivative of $B(A,Z)$ with respect to $Z$, setting it to zero. The terms $a_{v} A$ and $a_{s} A^{2/3}$ are constant with respect to $Z$ and thus their derivative is zero. We focus on the $Z$-dependent terms: the Coulomb term and the asymmetry term.\n\nLet's compute the derivative $\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial Z}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial Z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Z} \\left( - a_{c} \\frac{Z^2 - Z}{A^{1/3}} - a_{a} \\frac{(A-2Z)^2}{A} \\right)\n$$\nWe differentiate term by term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Z} \\left( - \\frac{a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} (Z^2 - Z) \\right) = - \\frac{a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} (2Z - 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Z} \\left( - \\frac{a_{a}}{A} (A-2Z)^2 \\right) = - \\frac{a_{a}}{A} \\cdot 2(A-2Z) \\cdot (-2) = \\frac{4a_{a}}{A} (A-2Z)\n$$\nCombining these results, the full derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial Z} = - \\frac{a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} (2Z - 1) + \\frac{4a_{a}}{A} (A-2Z)\n$$\nExpanding the expression:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial Z} = -\\frac{2a_{c}Z}{A^{1/3}} + \\frac{a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} + 4a_{a} - \\frac{8a_{a}Z}{A}\n$$\nTo find the extremum $Z^{\\star}$, we set the derivative to zero:\n$$\n-\\frac{2a_{c}Z^{\\star}}{A^{1/3}} + \\frac{a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} + 4a_{a} - \\frac{8a_{a}Z^{\\star}}{A} = 0\n$$\nNow, we must solve for $Z^{\\star}$. We group the terms containing $Z^{\\star}$ on one side of the equation:\n$$\nZ^{\\star} \\left( \\frac{2a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} + \\frac{8a_{a}}{A} \\right) = \\frac{a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} + 4a_{a}\n$$\nIsolating $Z^{\\star}$:\n$$\nZ^{\\star} = \\frac{\\frac{a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} + 4a_{a}}{\\frac{2a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} + \\frac{8a_{a}}{A}}\n$$\nTo present this as a single closed-form expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $A$:\n$$\nZ^{\\star} = \\frac{A \\left( \\frac{a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} + 4a_{a} \\right)}{A \\left( \\frac{2a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} + \\frac{8a_{a}}{A} \\right)} = \\frac{a_{c}A^{2/3} + 4a_{a}A}{2a_{c}A^{2/3} + 8a_{a}}\n$$\nTo confirm this extremum is a maximum, we examine the second derivative, $\\frac{\\partial^2 B}{\\partial Z^2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 B}{\\partial Z^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Z} \\left( -\\frac{2a_{c}Z}{A^{1/3}} + \\frac{a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} + 4a_{a} - \\frac{8a_{a}Z}{A} \\right) = -\\frac{2a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} - \\frac{8a_{a}}{A}\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 B}{\\partial Z^2} = - \\left( \\frac{2a_{c}}{A^{1/3}} + \\frac{8a_{a}}{A} \\right)\n$$\nSince $A$, $a_{c}$, and $a_{a}$ are all given as positive, the term in the parentheses is strictly positive. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial^2 B}{\\partial Z^2} < 0$, which confirms that the value $Z^{\\star}$ corresponds to a maximum of the binding energy function.\n\nThis value $Z^{\\star}(A)$ represents the theoretical atomic number for which an isobar of mass number $A$ has the maximum possible binding energy and thus the minimum mass. In nature, atomic numbers must be integers. The actual most stable isobar in a given chain will have an integer atomic number, $Z_{stable}$, which is the integer closest to the calculated real value $Z^{\\star}(A)$. For odd $A$, the mass parabola has a single minimum, leading to typically one stable isobar. Any other isobar in the chain $(A, Z)$ with $Z \\neq Z_{stable}$ will be less stable and can undergo spontaneous decay (beta decay or electron capture) to transform its proton-neutron composition, moving closer to the bottom of the \"valley of stability\" defined by $Z^{\\star}(A)$. This is why finding the $Z$ that maximizes $B(A,Z)$ is equivalent to identifying the line of greatest nuclear stability on the chart of nuclides.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4 a_{a} A + a_{c} A^{2/3}}{8 a_{a} + 2 a_{c} A^{2/3}}}\n$$", "id": "2919495"}, {"introduction": "While periodic tables often list a single atomic weight for each element, this value represents an average over many terrestrial sources, a concept formalized by IUPAC standard atomic weight intervals.

The fundamental principle for this evaluation is the definition of the sample-specific atomic weight, $A_{\\mathrm{r}}(\\text{E, sample})$, for an element E. It is the weighted average of the masses of its stable isotopes, where the weighting factors are the mole fractions (atomic fractions) of those isotopes in the specific sample. For boron, which has two stable isotopes, $^{10}\\mathrm{B}$ and $^{11}\\mathrm{B}$, the formula is:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{r}}(\\mathrm{B}, \\text{sample}) = x(^{10}\\mathrm{B}) \\cdot m(^{10}\\mathrm{B}) + x(^{11}\\mathrm{B}) \\cdot m(^{11}\\mathrm{B})$$\nHere, $x(^{i}\\mathrm{B})$ is the mole fraction of isotope $i$ and $m(^{i}\\mathrm{B})$ is its isotopic mass.\n\nThe problem provides the necessary data for the groundwater sample:\n- Isotopic fractions: $x(^{10}\\mathrm{B}) = 0.80$ and $x(^{11}\\mathrm{B}) = 0.20$.\n- Isotopic masses: $m(^{10}\\mathrm{B}) = 10.012937$ u and $m(^{11}\\mathrm{B}) = 11.009305$ u.\n\nSubstituting these values into the definition:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{r}}(\\mathrm{B}, \\text{sample}) = (0.80) \\cdot (10.012937) + (0.20) \\cdot (11.009305)$$\n$$A_{\\mathrm{r}}(\\mathrm{B}, \\text{sample}) = 8.0103496 + 2.201861$$\n$$A_{\\mathrm{r}}(\\mathrm{B}, \\text{sample}) = 10.2122106 \\text{ u}$$\n\nThe calculated atomic weight for the boron in the groundwater sample is approximately $10.212$.

The calculated value of $10.212$ is significantly below the lower bound of this interval ($10.806$).\n\nThe IUPAC standard atomic weight interval is defined to encompass the range of atomic weights found in \"normal terrestrial materials.\" This definition explicitly excludes materials that have been significantly altered by technological processes, as well as extraterrestrial materials. The fact that the sample's atomic weight falls far outside this interval indicates that the sample is not a \"normal terrestrial material\" in the IUPAC sense.\n\nThe context provided is crucial: the sample is from groundwater near a pressurized water reactor (PWR) that uses boric acid as a neutron absorber. The isotope $^{10}\\mathrm{B}$ has a very large neutron capture cross-section, making it highly effective for controlling nuclear fission. Consequently, boric acid used in nuclear reactors is often artificially enriched in $^{10}\\mathrm{B}$.

The sample's measured composition of $x(^{10}\\mathrm{B}) = 0.80$ represents a massive enrichment, which is characteristic of an anthropogenic source, not a natural process.

The reasoning is sound and complete. **Correct**.\n\nB. The IUPAC interval arises primarily from measurement uncertainty in isotopic masses; the atomic weight of an element is fixed by its atomic number. For the groundwater, approximating with mass numbers gives $A_{\\mathrm{r}}\\approx\\left(0.80\\right)\\left(10\\right)+\\left(0.20\\right)\\left(11\\right)=10.2$, which should be considered within the IUPAC interval because the stated interval bounds are not absolute.\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. The IUPAC interval arises from natural *variability in isotopic abundance*, not measurement uncertainty of isotopic masses. The statement that atomic weight is fixed by atomic number is false; all isotopes of an element share an atomic number but have different masses, leading to variable atomic weight. Finally, concluding the value is \"within the interval\" because the bounds are \"not absolute\" is an incorrect dismissal of the significance of the interval itself. The calculated value is profoundly different from the interval range. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Because the IUPAC standard atomic weight interval by definition bounds all possible terrestrial samples, any measured sample outside $\\left[10.806,\\,10.821\\right]$ must be erroneous. The reported $x(^{10}\\mathrm{B})=0.80$ cannot be geochemically real.\nThis option misinterprets the definition. The IUPAC interval bounds *normal* terrestrial samples, not *all* possible ones. Samples from technologically modified materials or specific mineral deposits can and do fall outside the interval. To declare such a measurement \"erroneous\" or \"not geochemically real\" is incorrect. Such materials are real; they are simply not \"normal\" in this specific context. The high enrichment is real in manufactured materials. **Incorrect**.\n\nD.

While natural isotopic fractionation occurs, shifting the abundance of $^{10}\\mathrm{B}$ from a natural baseline of $\\approx 20\\%$ to $80\\%$ is an extreme variation not observed from processes like evaporation or mineral-fluid partitioning in natural systems. The context of the nearby PWR provides a far more direct and quantitatively reasonable explanation. **Incorrect**.\n\nE.

The difference in total electronic binding energy, $\\Delta B_{elec}$, between two isotopes of nuclear mass $M_1$ and $M_2$ is approximately:\n$$\\Delta B_{elec} \\approx B_{elec} \\cdot Z \\cdot m_e \\left( \\frac{1}{M_1} - \\frac{1}{M_2} \\right) = B_{elec} \\cdot Z \\cdot m_e \\frac{M_2-M_1}{M_1 M_2}$$\nFor chlorine ($Z=17$), we estimate the total binding energy $B_{elec}(Z=17) \\approx (20.8\\ \\mathrm{eV}) \\cdot (17)^{7/3} \\approx 2.2 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{eV}$. Let's take $B_{elec} \\approx 2 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe isotopes are ${}^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}$ and ${}^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}$, so $M_1 \\approx 35\\ \\mathrm{u}$, $M_2 \\approx 37\\ \\mathrm{u}$, and $M_2 - M_1 \\approx 2\\ \\mathrm{u}$. The electron mass is $m_e \\approx 5.48 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{u}$.\n$$\\Delta B_{elec} \\approx (2 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{eV}) \\cdot 17 \\cdot (5.48 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{u}) \\frac{2\\ \\mathrm{u}}{(35\\ \\mathrm{u})(37\\ \\mathrm{u})} \\approx (2 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{eV}) \\cdot (9.3 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\approx 0.28\\ \\mathrm{eV}$$\nMy estimation is slightly different but the logic in the question is based on total reduced mass effect: $\\Delta B_{elec} \\approx B_{elec} \\cdot m_e \\frac{M_2-M_1}{M_1 M_2}$.\n$$\\Delta B_{elec} \\approx (2 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{eV}) \\cdot (5.48 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{u}) \\frac{2\\ \\mathrm{u}}{(35\\ \\mathrm{u})(37\\ \\mathrm{u})} \\approx (2 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{eV}) \\cdot (8.5 \\times 10^{-7}) \\approx 1.7 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{eV}$$\nThis result is in excellent agreement with the statement's estimate of about $10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{eV}$. Now, convert this energy difference to a mass difference:\n$$\\Delta m = \\frac{\\Delta B_{elec}}{c^2} \\approx \\frac{10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{eV}}{931.5 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{eV/u}} \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{u}$$\nThis matches the statement's value of $\\sim 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{u}$.\nFinally, we compare this to ppm precision for chlorine. For an atom of mass $\\sim 35\\ \\mathrm{u}$, $1$ ppm is $35 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{u}$. The mass effect of the electronic isotope shift ($\\sim 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{u}$) is over five orders of magnitude smaller. Thus, it is indeed far below ppm precision and can be safely ignored in most isotope ratio comparisons.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. In converting the measured mass of a singly charged ion to the neutral-atom mass, one must add one electron rest mass and subtract the first ionization energy divided by $c^{2}$; for typical first ionization energies of $\\sim 10\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ this correction is $\\sim 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{u}$, which is relevant at or below the parts-per-billion level in Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS).**\n\nA singly charged positive ion, $X^+$, is formed from a neutral atom, $X$, by removing one electron. The energy required is the first ionization energy, $IE_1$. By mass-energy equivalence, the masses are related by:\n$$M(X^+) + m_e - IE_1/c^2 = M(X_{neutral})$$\nTherefore, to find the neutral atom mass from the ion mass, one must add the electron rest mass and subtract the mass equivalent of the first ionization energy: $M(X_{neutral}) = M(X^+) + m_e - IE_1/c^2$. The first part of the statement is correct.\nThe problem gives a typical $IE_1 \\sim 10\\ \\mathrm{eV}$. Let's calculate the mass equivalent of this correction term:\n$$\\Delta m_{IE} = \\frac{IE_1}{c^2} = \\frac{10\\ \\mathrm{eV}}{1\\ \\mathrm{u} \\cdot c^2} = \\frac{10\\ \\mathrm{eV}}{931.494 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{eV/u}} \\approx 1.07 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{u}$$\nThis matches the statement's estimate of $\\sim 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{u}$.\nTo assess its relevance, we consider the relative correction: $\\Delta m_{IE} / M_{atom}$. For a mid-range atom with mass number $A \\approx 50$, the relative effect is $\\frac{1.07 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{u}}{50\\ \\mathrm{u}} \\approx 2.1 \\times 10^{-10}$, or $0.21$ parts per billion (ppb). For lighter atoms, the effect is larger (e.g., $1$ ppb for $A \\approx 10$). Since ppb is $10^{-9}$, this correction is indeed relevant for any measurement aiming for precision at or below the ppb level. The problem rightfully notes that IRMS can target high precisions, for which such a correction is not negligible.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Because the unified atomic mass unit (u) is defined as one twelfth of the mass of a neutral ${}^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atom in its ground state, tabulated atomic masses of neutral atoms already include electronic binding energies; neglecting these energies introduces no bias when comparing neutral-atom masses on the $\\mathrm{u}$ scale, but neglecting them when translating between ions and neutrals does.**\n\nThe definition of the unified atomic mass unit, $1\\ \\mathrm{u} = \\frac{1}{12} M(^{12}\\mathrm{C}_{neutral})$, is based on the total mass of a neutral atom. This mass, $M(^{12}\\mathrm{C}_{neutral})$, inherently includes the masses of the nucleus and all electrons, as well as the negative mass defect from all binding energies (nuclear and electronic). Consequently, any atomic mass listed in a table in units of 'u' is a ratio relative to this standard, and it represents the mass of the neutral atom, with all physical effects, including electronic binding, already incorporated.\nWhen comparing the masses of two different neutral atoms, say $M(X)$ and $M(Y)$, both expressed in u, one is simply comparing two physical quantities on the same scale. There is no need to perform any explicit correction for electronic binding energies, as they are an intrinsic part of the masses being compared. The statement that this introduces no bias is correct.\nHowever, as demonstrated in the analysis of option C, when a mass spectrometer measures an ion's mass, $M(X^+)$, and one wishes to report the neutral atom's mass, $M(X)$, a conversion is required. This conversion must account for both the electron rest mass and its binding energy ($IE_1$). Neglecting the $IE_1/c^2$ term introduces a systematic error (a bias). The entire statement is therefore a correct and fundamental point about the practice of mass spectrometry.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. The dependence of electronic binding energies on isotope mass number $A$ scales as $Z^{2}$ and therefore dominates the mass differences among isotopes at high resolution.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect on two counts.\nFirst, the scaling is wrong. The dependence of electronic binding energies on the isotope mass number $A$ is the isotope shift, analyzed in option B. The magnitude of this shift, $\\Delta B_{elec}$, depends on the total binding energy $B_{elec}$ (which scales roughly as $Z^{7/3}$), but its dependence on $A$ is through a factor like $(M_2 - M_1) / (M_1 M_2)$. It does not scale as $Z^2$. The total electronic binding energy itself scales with $Z$, but its variation with $A$ is a separate, much smaller effect.\nSecond, this effect in no way \"dominates\" the mass differences among isotopes. The primary mass difference between two isotopes, e.g., ${}^{A+1}X$ and ${}^A X$, is the mass of one neutron plus the change in nuclear binding energy.\n$\\Delta M \\approx m_n \\pm \\Delta B_{nuc}/c^2$.\n$m_n \\approx 1\\ \\mathrm{u}$. The change in nuclear binding energy, $\\Delta B_{nuc}$, is typically on the order of several $\\mathrm{MeV}$, corresponding to a mass difference of $\\sim 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{u}$. From option B, the mass difference due to the electronic isotope shift is $\\sim 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{u}$. The effect of electronic energies is about eight orders of magnitude smaller than the effect of nuclear composition. Hence, it is a minuscule correction, not the dominant term.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCD}$$", "id": "2919526"}]}
