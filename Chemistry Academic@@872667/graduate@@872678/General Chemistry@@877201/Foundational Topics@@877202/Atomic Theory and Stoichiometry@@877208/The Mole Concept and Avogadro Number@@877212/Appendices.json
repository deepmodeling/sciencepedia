Let $n$ denote the amount of substance in moles and $N$ the number of discrete entities (here, molecules of $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$).

After the redefinition, $N_\\mathrm{A}$ is an exact constant that defines the mole, so the conversion factor $N_\\mathrm{A}$ introduces no additional uncertainty. All uncertainty in $N$ arises solely from the uncertainty in $n$. Physically, $N$ must be an integer, but when $n$ is given with finite precision, $N$ is reported as a rounded real-number estimate consistent with the uncertainty in $n$; the exactness of $N_\\mathrm{A}$ ensures that no further uncertainty is added by the conversion itself.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.51 \\times 10^{15}}$$", "id": "2959925"}, {"introduction": "To truly grasp the mole concept, it is instructive to explore its conventional nature through a thought experiment.
