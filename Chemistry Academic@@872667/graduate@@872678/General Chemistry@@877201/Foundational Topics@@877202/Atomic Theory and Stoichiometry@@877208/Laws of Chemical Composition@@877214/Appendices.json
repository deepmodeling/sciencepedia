Using the mole concept and modern atomic weights, this qualitative mass-based law can be recast into an equivalent statement about ratios of amounts of substance.

The task is a standard application of stoichiometric principles.\n\nThe problem is separated into two tasks: (i) to reformulate the law of reciprocal proportions in terms of mole ratios, and (ii) to apply this formulation to determine the empirical formula of a cerium-bromine compound.\n\n**Part (i): Formulation of the Mole-Ratio Version of the Law of Reciprocal Proportions**\n\nLet there be three elements, which we will denote as $A$, $B$, and $C$. In this specific problem, $A$ is cerium ($\\mathrm{Ce}$), $B$ is bromine ($\\mathrm{Br}$), and $C$ is oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}$).\nThe fundamental relationship between the amount of substance $n$ (in moles), mass $m$, and molar mass $M$ for any element or compound is:\n$$ n = \\frac{m}{M} $$\nThis relationship is a direct consequence of the definitions of the mole and molar mass. The integer-atom hypothesis states that atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios, which implies that the stoichiometric coefficients in an empirical formula, such as $p$ and $q$ in $A_pB_q$, are integers.\n\nConsider Compound I, composed of elements $A$ and $C$. From a given mass composition (mass percent $\\%A_{\\text{I}}$ and $\\%C_{\\text{I}}$), the ratio of the amount of substance of $A$ to $C$ is found by considering an arbitrary sample mass, which cancels out of the ratio:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{n_A}{n_C}\\right)_{\\text{I}} = \\frac{m_A / M_A}{m_C / M_C} = \\frac{(\\%A_{\\text{I}}) / M_A}{(\\%C_{\\text{I}}) / M_C} $$\nThis ratio represents the moles of element $A$ that combine per mole of element $C$ in Compound I.\n\nSimilarly, for Compound II, composed of elements $B$ and $C$, with mass percents $\\%B_{\\text{II}}$ and $\\%C_{\\text{II}}$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{n_B}{n_C}\\right)_{\\text{II}} = \\frac{m_B / M_B}{m_C / M_C} = \\frac{(\\%B_{\\text{II}}) / M_B}{(\\%C_{\\text{II}}) / M_C} $$\nThis ratio represents the moles of element $B$ that combine per mole of element $C$ in Compound II.\n\nThe original law considers the masses of $A$ and $B$ that combine with a *fixed mass* of $C$. The modern equivalent is to consider the moles of $A$ and $B$ that combine with a *fixed amount* of $C$, for example, $1\\ \\mathrm{mol}$. The ratio of these amounts of $A$ and $B$ is a predicted combining ratio for $A$ and $B$:\n$$ R_{\\text{predicted}} = \\frac{\\text{moles of } A \\text{ per mole of } C}{\\text{moles of } B \\text{ per mole of } C} = \\frac{(n_A/n_C)_{\\text{I}}}{(n_B/n_C)_{\\text{II}}} $$\nNow consider Compound III, with empirical formula $A_pB_q$. The ratio of the amounts of substance $p/q$ is determined from its mass composition, $\\%A_{\\text{III}}$ and $\\%B_{\\text{III}}$:\n$$ \\frac{p}{q} = \\left(\\frac{n_A}{n_B}\\right)_{\\text{III}} = \\frac{(\\%A_{\\text{III}}) / M_A}{(\\%B_{\\text{III}}) / M_B} $$\nThe law of reciprocal proportions asserts that the ratio in which two elements combine is simply related to the ratio of their masses that combine with a third element. The presence of multiple oxidation states or combining capacities, governed by the law of multiple proportions, introduces the possibility of a \"simple multiple\". Translating to moles, the mole ratio $p/q$ in Compound III is related to the predicted ratio $R_{\\text{predicted}}$ by a simple rational number, which we denote as $j/k$ where $j$ and $k$ are small integers.\n\nThe formal mole-ratio statement of the law is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{j}{k} \\times \\frac{(n_A/n_C)_{\\text{I}}}{(n_B/n_C)_{\\text{II}}} $$\nIn the context of this problem, with $A = \\mathrm{Ce}$, $B = \\mathrm{Br}$, and $C = \\mathrm{O}$, the formula is:\n$$ \\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{j}{k} \\times \\frac{(n_{\\mathrm{Ce}}/n_{\\mathrm{O}})_{\\text{I}}}{(n_{\\mathrm{Br}}/n_{\\mathrm{O}})_{\\text{II}}} $$\nThis is the required formulation.\n\n**Part (ii): Application to Determine $p$ and $q$**\n\nWe are given the following data:\n$M_{\\mathrm{Ce}} = 140.116\\ \\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}}$\n$M_{\\mathrm{Br}} = 79.904\\ \\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}}$\n$M_{\\mathrm{O}} = 15.999\\ \\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the required mole ratios from the compositions of Compound I and Compound II.\nFor Compound I (cerium oxide, $\\mathrm{Ce}\\ 85.375\\,\\%$, $\\mathrm{O}\\ 14.625\\,\\%$):\n$$ \\left(\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{Ce}}}{n_{\\mathrm{O}}}\\right)_{\\text{I}} = \\frac{85.375 / M_{\\mathrm{Ce}}}{14.625 / M_{\\mathrm{O}}} = \\frac{85.375 / 140.116}{14.625 / 15.999} = \\frac{0.6093108}{0.9141196} = 0.666551 $$\nFor Compound II (bromine oxide, $\\mathrm{Br}\\ 66.656\\,\\%$, $\\mathrm{O}\\ 33.344\\,\\%$):\n$$ \\left(\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{Br}}}{n_{\\mathrm{O}}}\\right)_{\\text{II}} = \\frac{66.656 / M_{\\mathrm{Br}}}{33.344 / M_{\\mathrm{O}}} = \\frac{66.656 / 79.904}{33.344 / 15.999} = \\frac{0.8342010}{2.0841303} = 0.400262 $$\nNow we compute the predicted ratio, $R_{\\text{predicted}}$, for the combination of cerium and bromine:\n$$ R_{\\text{predicted}} = \\frac{(n_{\\mathrm{Ce}}/n_{\\mathrm{O}})_{\\text{I}}}{(n_{\\mathrm{Br}}/n_{\\mathrm{O}})_{\\text{II}}} = \\frac{0.666551}{0.400262} = 1.665258 $$\nNext, we calculate the experimental mole ratio $p/q$ from the composition of Compound III (cerium bromide, $\\mathrm{Ce}\\ 74.520\\,\\%$, $\\mathrm{Br}\\ 25.480\\,\\%$):\n$$ \\frac{p}{q} = \\left(\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{Ce}}}{n_{\\mathrm{Br}}}\\right)_{\\text{III}} = \\frac{74.520 / M_{\\mathrm{Ce}}}{25.480 / M_{\\mathrm{Br}}} = \\frac{74.520 / 140.116}{25.480 / 79.904} = \\frac{0.531849}{0.318883} = 1.667873 $$\nAccording to the law, these two ratios must be related by a simple rational number $j/k$:\n$$ \\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{j}{k} \\times R_{\\text{predicted}} $$\n$$ 1.667873 = \\frac{j}{k} \\times 1.665258 $$\nWe solve for the factor $j/k$:\n$$ \\frac{j}{k} = \\frac{1.667873}{1.665258} = 1.001570 $$\nThis value is exceedingly close to $1$. The data are therefore consistent with $j=1$ and $k=1$. This indicates that the combining equivalencies are directly transferable between the compounds.\nThe problem is reduced to finding the simplest integer ratio $p/q$ that corresponds to the experimentally determined value of $1.667873$. This value is very close to the rational number $5/3$:\n$$ \\frac{5}{3} = 1.6666... $$\nThe deviation of the experimental ratio from $5/3$ is less than $0.08\\,\\%$, which is well within the bounds of experimental uncertainty for compositional analysis.\nThus, we conclude that the ratio of the smallest positive integers $p$ and $q$ consistent with the data is:\n$$ \\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{5}{3} $$\nThis gives $p=5$ and $q=3$.\nThe question asks for the sum $p+q$.\n$$ p+q = 5 + 3 = 8 $$\nThis result is based strictly on the provided data and the logical application of stoichiometric laws, as required.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{8} $$", "id": "2943623"}, {"introduction": "Classical laws, like the law of combining volumes, provide a powerful but idealized description of chemical reactions.

Using the virial equation, $V_{\\mathrm{mono}} = n_{\\mathrm{u}} Z_{1} \\frac{RT}{P}$, where $Z_{1} = 1 + B_{11} \\frac{P}{RT}$.\n$V_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is the volume of the equilibrium gas mixture containing $n_{\\mathrm{u}}$ moles of structural units. The total number of moles of gas particles is $n_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. The volume is $V_{\\mathrm{eq}} = n_{\\mathrm{tot}} Z_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\frac{RT}{P}$, where $Z_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 1 + B_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\frac{P}{RT}$.\n\nThe ratio is therefore $\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{V_{\\mathrm{mono}}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{tot}} Z_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{n_{\\mathrm{u}} Z_{1}}$.\n\nLet us relate $n_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ to $n_{\\mathrm{u}}$. A system with $n_{\\mathrm{u}}$ moles of structural units will contain, at equilibrium, $n_1$ moles of $\\mathrm{NO_2}$ and $n_2$ moles of $\\mathrm{N_2O_4}$. The conservation of structural units dictates $n_{\\mathrm{u}} = n_1 + 2n_2$. The total number of moles is $n_{\\mathrm{tot}} = n_1 + n_2$. The molar ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{n_{\\mathrm{u}}} = \\frac{n_1 + n_2}{n_1 + 2n_2} = \\frac{(n_1+n_2)/n_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{(n_1+2n_2)/n_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{1}{y_1 + 2y_2} $$\nSince $y_1+y_2 = 1$, we can write this as $\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{n_{\\mathrm{u}}} = \\frac{1}{y_1 + 2(1-y_1)} = \\frac{1}{2-y_1}$.

Our calculation shows significant amounts of $\\mathrm{NO_2}$ monomer ($y_1 \\approx 0.32$) remain, so the reaction is far from complete. The statement reflects a misunderstanding of chemical equilibrium.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Under the ideal-gas approximation, $V_{\\mathrm{eq}}/V_{\\mathrm{mono}}\\approx 0.596$ at $P=1.000\\ \\mathrm{bar}$; nonideality is negligible at this pressure, so the deviation from $0.500$ arises entirely from incomplete association, yet the law of combining volumes is fundamentally violated.**\nThe ideal-gas calculation gives $0.5955 \\approx 0.596$, which is correct. The reason for deviation from $0.500$ is correctly identified as incomplete association. However, the claim that \"nonideality is negligible\" is debatable and less precise than option C. More critically, the concluding claim that \"the law of combining volumes is fundamentally violated\" is false. The law of Gay-Lussac pertains to the ratio of volumes of gases that react and are produced, which is $2:1$ here. The experimenter's ratio $V_{\\mathrm{eq}}/V_{\\mathrm{mono}}$ is not what the law describes. The law is not violated; it is misapplied.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Under the ideal-gas approximation, $V_{\\mathrm{eq}}/V_{\\mathrm{mono}}\\approx 0.596$ at $P=1.000\\ \\mathrm{bar}$ from the equilibrium composition; inclusion of the given second-virial nonideality reduces this ratio by roughly $0.7\\%$ (to about $0.592$), showing that the deviation from $0.500$ is primarily due to incomplete association with a small additional real-gas correction. The $2:1$ stoichiometric volume ratio is recovered in the low-pressure limit and/or at conditions where association goes to completion, so the law is not violated.**\nThis statement is quantitatively and conceptually correct.\n- Ideal-gas ratio: Our calculation gives $0.5955 \\approx 0.596$. Correct.\n- Non-ideal correction: Our calculation shows a reduction of $\\approx 0.77\\%$. \"Roughly $0.7\\%$\" is accurate.\n- Corrected value: Our value is $0.5909$. \"About $0.592$\" is a reasonable statement. For example, $0.5955 \\times (1-0.007) \\approx 0.5914$.\n- Physical reasoning: It correctly identifies that the large deviation from $0.500$ is due to incomplete reaction, while the small additional correction is due to gas non-ideality.\n- Interpretation of the law: It correctly implies that the law of combining volumes is not violated but is a limiting law whose stoichiometric prediction becomes manifest for the volumes that actually react under conditions approaching ideality. Under conditions of complete reaction, the total volume change reflects the $2:1$ stoichiometry (in the ideal gas limit).\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. $V_{\\mathrm{eq}}/V_{\\mathrm{mono}}>1$ at $P=1.000\\ \\mathrm{bar}$ because association increases repulsive interactions, expanding the gas; therefore nonideal effects change the effective stoichiometric coefficients and the combining-volume concept is inapplicable.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds.\n- $V_{\\mathrm{eq}}/V_{\\mathrm{mono}}>1$: Our calculation is $\\approx 0.591$. Association reduces the number of moles, which leads to a volume decrease.\n- \"association increases repulsive interactions\": This is physically false. The negative virial coefficients indicate dominant attractive forces, leading to a volume smaller than an ideal gas.\n- \"nonideal effects change the effective stoichiometric coefficients\": This is nonsense. Stoichiometry is a statement about molecular counts and is invariant.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2943535"}, {"introduction": "The existence of non-stoichiometric compounds, such as $\\text{TiO}_{2-x}$, presents a fascinating challenge to the classical law of definite proportions.

The system is at thermodynamic equilibrium, which corresponds to the minimum of the molar Gibbs free energy, $G_m$, with respect to the concentration of defects at constant $T$ and $p_{\\text{O}_2}$. The only defects considered are neutral oxygen vacancies, $V_{\\text{O}}$.\n\nLet $y$ be the fraction of vacant sites on the oxygen sublattice. Since there are $2$ oxygen sites per formula unit of $\\text{TiO}_2$, the formula for the oxygen-deficient compound is $\\text{TiO}_{2(1-y)}$.

The total Gibbs free energy contribution from forming these vacancies is $2y \\cdot \\Delta g_{v}(T, p_{\\text{O}_2})$.\n\n2.  **Configurational Entropy**: The configurational disorder arises from arranging $2y$ moles of vacancies and $2(1-y)$ moles of oxygen atoms on the $2$ moles of available oxygen sites per formula unit.
