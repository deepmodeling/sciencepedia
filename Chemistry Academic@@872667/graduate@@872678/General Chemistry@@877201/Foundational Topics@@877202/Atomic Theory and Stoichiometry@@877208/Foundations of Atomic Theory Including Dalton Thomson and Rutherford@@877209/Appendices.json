This practice demonstrates how simple mass ratios from laboratory measurements can reveal the fundamental, discrete rules by which atoms combine, providing a cornerstone for all of modern chemistry.", "problem": "A chemist in the early nineteenth century era of John Dalton measures the mass composition of two distinct gaseous nitrogen oxides, later identified as nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide. Relying only on Dalton’s atomic hypothesis (atoms combine in whole-number ratios), the law of conservation of mass, and the law of definite proportions, infer the relative integer stoichiometry of oxygen to nitrogen by comparing how much oxygen combines with the same mass of nitrogen in the two compounds.\n\nTwo independently prepared pure samples are analyzed gravimetrically to yield the following oxygen mass fractions (mass of oxygen divided by total sample mass):\n- For nitric oxide, labeled as compound A, the oxygen mass fraction is $w_{\\mathrm{O},A} = 0.53295$.\n- For nitrogen dioxide, labeled as compound B, the oxygen mass fraction is $w_{\\mathrm{O},B} = 0.69576$.\n\nStarting from the above foundational laws and definitions only (do not assume any unproven compositional formulas), perform the following:\n- Derive an expression for the ratio $r$ of the oxygen masses that combine with the same mass of nitrogen in compound B versus compound A, expressed purely in terms of $w_{\\mathrm{O},A}$ and $w_{\\mathrm{O},B}$.\n- Evaluate $r$ numerically using the given data. Then, using Dalton’s atomic hypothesis, argue why $r$ should be close to a small rational number and identify its simplest whole-number interpretation.\n\nReport only the numerical value of $r$ as your final answer, expressed as a dimensionless number and rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem presented is a classic exercise in stoichiometry, grounded in the foundational principles of early atomic theory. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. We will proceed with a systematic derivation.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the ratio of oxygen masses that combine with a fixed mass of nitrogen in two different nitrogen oxides, herein labeled compound A and compound B. The only information provided are the experimentally determined mass fractions of oxygen in each compound, along with the fundamental laws of chemistry as understood in Dalton's time.\n\nLet $m_{\\mathrm{O}}$ be the mass of oxygen and $m_{\\mathrm{N}}$ be the mass of nitrogen in a given sample of a nitrogen oxide. The total mass of the sample is $m_{\\text{total}} = m_{\\mathrm{O}} + m_{\\mathrm{N}}$, a consequence of the law of conservation of mass.\n\nThe mass fraction of oxygen, $w_{\\mathrm{O}}$, is defined as the ratio of the mass of oxygen to the total mass of the sample:\n$$w_{\\mathrm{O}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}}}{m_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}}}{m_{\\mathrm{O}} + m_{\\mathrm{N}}}$$\nSimilarly, the mass fraction of nitrogen is $w_{\\mathrm{N}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{N}}}{m_{\\text{total}}}$. It follows directly that $w_{\\mathrm{O}} + w_{\\mathrm{N}} = 1$, and thus $w_{\\mathrm{N}} = 1 - w_{\\mathrm{O}}$.\n\nThe law of definite proportions states that the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of a given compound is always the same. We are interested in the ratio of the mass of oxygen to the mass of nitrogen, $\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}}}$. This ratio represents the mass of oxygen that combines with one unit mass of nitrogen. We can express this ratio in terms of the given mass fraction $w_{\\mathrm{O}}$:\n$$\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}}/m_{\\text{total}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}}/m_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{O}}}{w_{\\mathrm{N}}} = \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{O}}}{1 - w_{\\mathrm{O}}}$$\n\nWe apply this general relation to each of the two compounds. For compound A (nitric oxide), the mass of oxygen combining per unit mass of nitrogen is:\n$$\\left(\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}}}\\right)_A = \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{O},A}}{1 - w_{\\mathrm{O},A}}$$\nFor compound B (nitrogen dioxide), the mass of oxygen combining per unit mass of nitrogen is:\n$$\\left(\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}}}\\right)_B = \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{O},B}}{1 - w_{\\mathrm{O},B}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $r$, defined as the mass of oxygen in compound B that combines with a fixed mass of nitrogen, divided by the mass of oxygen in compound A that combines with the same fixed mass of nitrogen. This is precisely the ratio of the two quantities we have just expressed:\n$$r = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}}}\\right)_B}{\\left(\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}}}\\right)_A}$$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of mass fractions, we derive the required expression for $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{\\frac{w_{\\mathrm{O},B}}{1 - w_{\\mathrm{O},B}}}{\\frac{w_{\\mathrm{O},A}}{1 - w_{\\mathrm{O},A}}} = \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{O},B}}{1 - w_{\\mathrm{O},B}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - w_{\\mathrm{O},A}}{w_{\\mathrm{O},A}}$$\nThis is the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we must evaluate $r$ numerically using the provided data: $w_{\\mathrm{O},A} = 0.53295$ and $w_{\\mathrm{O},B} = 0.69576$.\nFirst, we calculate the corresponding nitrogen mass fractions:\n$$1 - w_{\\mathrm{O},A} = 1 - 0.53295 = 0.46705$$\n$$1 - w_{\\mathrm{O},B} = 1 - 0.69576 = 0.30424$$\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{0.69576}{0.30424} \\cdot \\frac{0.46705}{0.53295} \\approx 2.28694 \\times 0.87636 \\approx 2.00410$$\nThe numerical value of the ratio is approximately $2.0041$.\n\nFinally, we must interpret this result in the context of Dalton's atomic hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that elements are composed of indivisible atoms and that chemical compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in simple, whole-number ratios. This leads directly to the law of multiple proportions. If two elements (here, N and O) form more than one compound, the ratio of the masses of one element (O) that combine with a fixed mass of the other element (N) will be a ratio of small whole numbers.\nOur calculated ratio $r$ is precisely this ratio. The value $r \\approx 2.0041$ is, within the bounds of experimental error, equal to the integer $2$. The simplest whole-number interpretation is therefore $2$, or $\\frac{2}{1}$.\nThis means that for a fixed mass of nitrogen, compound B contains twice the mass of oxygen as compound A. In the language of atomic theory, this implies that for a fixed number of nitrogen atoms, compound B contains twice the number of oxygen atoms as compound A. If compound A had the formula $\\text{N}_{x}\\text{O}_{y}$, then compound B would have the formula $\\text{N}_{x}\\text{O}_{2y}$, assuming the same number of nitrogen atoms in the simplest formula unit. For example, if compound A is $\\text{NO}$, then compound B is $\\text{NO}_{2}$. The ratio of oxygen atoms to nitrogen atoms is twice as large in the second compound, consistent with our finding that $r=2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of $r$, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$r \\approx 2.00410 \\rightarrow 2.00$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.00}$$", "id": "2939244"}, {"introduction": "Following Dalton's establishment of the atom, the next monumental step was peering inside it. This problem reconstructs the essential physics of J.J. Thomson's 1897 experiment, which identified the first subatomic particle, the electron.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of ambiguity. It shall be solved.\n\nFirst, we address the acceleration of the electron. The problem states that an electron, with charge $e$ and mass $m$, is accelerated from rest through an electric potential difference $V$. The work-energy theorem states that the work done on a particle by the net force equals the change in its kinetic energy. In this case, the work $W$ done by the electric field on the electron is given by the product of the magnitude of the electron's charge, $|e|$, and the potential difference $V$.\n$$W = |e|V$$\nThe change in kinetic energy, $\\Delta K$, is the difference between the final kinetic energy, $K_f$, and the initial kinetic energy, $K_i$. Since the electron starts from rest, its initial velocity is zero, and thus $K_i = 0$. The final kinetic energy, for nonrelativistic motion, is $K_f = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $v$ is the final speed of the electron.\n$$\\Delta K = K_f - K_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - 0 = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\nEquating the work done to the change in kinetic energy gives:\n$$|e|V = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to express the square of the electron's speed in terms of the given quantities and its fundamental properties:\n$$v^2 = \\frac{2|e|V}{m} \\quad (1)$$\n\nNext, we analyze the electron's motion within the uniform magnetic field. The problem states that the electron beam enters a region of uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$ with its velocity $\\vec{v}$ perpendicular to the field $\\vec{B}$. The magnetic force, or Lorentz force, experienced by a charge $q$ moving with velocity $\\vec{v}$ in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is given by $\\vec{F}_B = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$. For an electron, $q=e=-|e|$. The magnitude of this force is $F_B = |e|vB\\sin(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{B}$. Since the motion is perpendicular, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, and $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 1$. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is:\n$$F_B = |e|vB$$\nThis force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the electron. Consequently, it does no work and cannot change the electron's speed or its kinetic energy. It acts as a centripetal force, causing the electron to follow a circular path. The centripetal force required for a particle of mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ in a circle of radius $r$ is given by:\n$$F_c = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$$\nEquating the magnetic force to the centripetal force provides the second key relation for this problem:\n$$|e|vB = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$$\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing by $v$ (since $v \\neq 0$):\n$$|e|B = \\frac{mv}{r}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to give an expression for the speed $v$:\n$$v = \\frac{|e|Br}{m} \\quad (2)$$\n\nNow we have two independent expressions involving the speed $v$. We must eliminate $v$ to find the desired charge-to-mass ratio, $\\frac{|e|}{m}$. We substitute the expression for $v$ from equation $(2)$ into equation $(1)$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{|e|Br}{m}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2|e|V}{m}$$\nExpanding the term on the left side yields:\n$$\\frac{|e|^2 B^2 r^2}{m^2} = \\frac{2|e|V}{m}$$\nTo solve for $\\frac{|e|}{m}$, we can divide both sides by $|e|$ and multiply by $m$ (as $|e| \\neq 0$ and $m \\neq 0$):\n$$\\frac{|e| B^2 r^2}{m} = 2V$$\nFinally, isolating the charge-to-mass ratio gives the derived expression:\n$$\\frac{|e|}{m} = \\frac{2V}{B^2 r^2}$$\nThis expression for $\\frac{|e|}{m}$ depends only on the quantities provided in the problem statement: $V$, $B$, and $r$.\n\nThe next step is to calculate the numerical value of this ratio, which we denote as $\\left(\\frac{|e|}{m}\\right)_{\\mathrm{exp}}$.
