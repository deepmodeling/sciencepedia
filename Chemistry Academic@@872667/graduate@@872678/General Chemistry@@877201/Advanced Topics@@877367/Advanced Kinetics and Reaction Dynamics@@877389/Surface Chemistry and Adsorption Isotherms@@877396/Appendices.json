It represents a standard exercise in chemical kinetics and data analysis related to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. All required data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or factual inaccuracies. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts: the derivation of the model and its linear form, the numerical estimation of the model parameter from provided data, and a brief discussion of a statistical limitation of the method used.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the surface coverage $\\theta$ at equilibrium. The adsorption process is elementary, with the rate of adsorption, $r_{\\mathrm{ads}}$, proportional to the gas pressure $p$ and the fraction of vacant sites, $(1-\\theta)$. The rate of desorption, $r_{\\mathrm{des}}$, is proportional to the fraction of occupied sites, $\\theta$. Introducing the rate constants $k_{\\mathrm{ads}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$, we can write the rate expressions as:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{ads}} = k_{\\mathrm{ads}} p (1 - \\theta)$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{des}} = k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\theta$$\nAt equilibrium, the rate of adsorption equals the rate of desorption, $r_{\\mathrm{ads}} = r_{\\mathrm{des}}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{ads}} p (1 - \\theta) = k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\theta$$\nWe must now solve this equation for $\\theta$. Expanding the left side gives:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{ads}} p - k_{\\mathrm{ads}} p \\theta = k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\theta$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $\\theta$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{ads}} p = k_{\\mathrm{des}} \\theta + k_{\\mathrm{ads}} p \\theta$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{ads}} p = \\theta (k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{ads}} p)$$\nThe expression for $\\theta$ is then:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ads}} p}{k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{ads}} p}$$\nUsing the definition of the equilibrium constant $K \\equiv k_{\\mathrm{ads}}/k_{\\mathrm{des}}$, we can simplify this expression by dividing the numerator and the denominator by $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{(k_{\\mathrm{ads}}/k_{\\mathrm{des}}) p}{1 + (k_{\\mathrm{ads}}/k_{\\mathrm{des}}) p} = \\frac{K p}{1 + K p}$$\nThis is the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.\n\nNext, we must obtain a linear relation between the variables $p/\\theta$ and $p$. Starting from the derived isotherm, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\theta} = \\frac{1 + K p}{K p}$$\nSeparating the terms on the right side yields:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{K p} + \\frac{K p}{K p} = \\frac{1}{K p} + 1$$\nMultiplying the entire equation by $p$ gives the desired linear form:\n$$\\frac{p}{\\theta} = p \\left(\\frac{1}{K p} + 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{K} + p$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = mx + c$, where $y = p/\\theta$, $x = p$, the slope is $m=1$, and the y-intercept is $c = 1/K$. Therefore, the equilibrium constant $K$ can be determined from the intercept of a plot of $p/\\theta$ versus $p$ as $K = 1/\\text{intercept}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires a numerical estimation of $K$ from experimental data. The data provided are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $p_1 = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{bar}$, $\\theta_1 = 2/7$\n    \\item $p_2 = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{bar}$, $\\theta_2 = 6/11$\n    \\item $p_3 = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{bar}$, $\\theta_3 = 2/3$\n\\end{itemize}\nWe must transform these data into the linear coordinate system $(x_i, y_i) = (p_i, p_i/\\theta_i)$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $i=1$: $x_1 = 0.2$, $y_1 = \\frac{0.2}{2/7} = \\frac{2/10}{2/7} = \\frac{7}{10} = 0.7$\n    \\item For $i=2$: $x_2 = 0.6$, $y_2 = \\frac{0.6}{6/11} = \\frac{6/10}{6/11} = \\frac{11}{10} = 1.1$\n    \\item For $i=3$: $x_3 = 1.0$, $y_3 = \\frac{1.0}{2/3} = \\frac{1}{2/3} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe dataset for regression is $\\{(0.2, 0.7), (0.6, 1.1), (1.0, 1.5)\\}$. We perform an unweighted ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression of $y$ on $x$ for the model $y = mx + c$. The number of data points is $n=3$.\nThe formulas for the OLS estimates of the intercept $c$ and slope $m$ are:\n$$c = \\bar{y} - m\\bar{x}$$\n$$m = \\frac{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i)}{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^2}$$\nWe calculate the required sums:\n$$\\sum x_i = 0.2 + 0.6 + 1.0 = 1.8$$\n$$\\sum y_i = 0.7 + 1.1 + 1.5 = 3.3$$\n$$\\sum x_i^2 = (0.2)^2 + (0.6)^2 + (1.0)^2 = 0.04 + 0.36 + 1.0 = 1.4$$\n$$\\sum x_i y_i = (0.2)(0.7) + (0.6)(1.1) + (1.0)(1.5) = 0.14 + 0.66 + 1.5 = 2.3$$\nFirst, we find the slope $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{3(2.3) - (1.8)(3.3)}{3(1.4) - (1.8)^2} = \\frac{6.9 - 5.94}{4.2 - 3.24} = \\frac{0.96}{0.96} = 1$$\nThe slope is exactly $1$, which is consistent with the theoretical model, as the data are given as exact.\nNow, we find the intercept $c$. We can use the formula involving the means, $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1.8}{3} = 0.6$ and $\\bar{y} = \\frac{3.3}{3} = 1.1$:\n$$c = \\bar{y} - m\\bar{x} = 1.1 - (1)(0.6) = 0.5$$\nThe estimated intercept is $c = 0.5$. The units of $p/\\theta$ are the units of pressure, bar, so the intercept is $0.5\\ \\mathrm{bar}$.\nFrom the linear model, we know that the intercept $c = 1/K$. Therefore, we can estimate $K$:\n$$K = \\frac{1}{c} = \\frac{1}{0.5\\ \\mathrm{bar}} = 2\\ \\mathrm{bar}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$K = 2.00\\ \\mathrm{bar}^{-1}$$\n\nFinally, we must address the statistical pitfall of using linear regression on transformed variables. Linearizing the model transforms the error structure of the data; specifically, if the measurement error in the original dependent variable $\\theta$ is assumed to be constant (homoscedastic), the error in the transformed variable $p/\\theta$ becomes dependent on the value of $\\theta$. This violation of the homoscedasticity assumption required for unweighted OLS can lead to biased or inefficient parameter estimates, as points with small $\\theta$ values (and thus large potential errors in $p/\\theta$) receive disproportionate influence in the fit.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.00}$$", "id": "2957525"}, {"introduction": "Scientific progress often involves comparing competing hypotheses.

Derivation of Adsorption Isotherm Models**\n\nThe equilibrium state of adsorption is governed by the equality of chemical potentials of the adsorbate in the gas phase ($\\mu_g$) and in the adsorbed phase ($\\mu_{ads}$):\n$$\n\\mu_g = \\mu_{ads}\n$$\nAssuming the gas phase behaves ideally, its chemical potential is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_g = \\mu_g^\\circ + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p^\\circ}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_g^\\circ$ is the standard chemical potential at a standard pressure $p^\\circ$, which is given as $p_0 = 1\\,\\mathrm{bar}$. The chemical potential of the adsorbed phase, $\\mu_{ads}$, depends on the physical model of the surface and the adsorbate-surface interactions.\n\n**1.1. Model L: The Langmuir Isotherm**\n\nThis model assumes adsorption occurs on a fixed number of identical, independent sites, forming a monolayer. The adsorption process can be treated as a chemical equilibrium: $G + S \\rightleftharpoons GS$, where $G$ is the gas molecule, $S$ is a vacant surface site, and $GS$ is an occupied site. The chemical potential of the adsorbed species, for an ideal lattice gas model, includes a configurational entropy term:\n$$\n\\mu_{ads} = \\mu_{ads}^\\circ - T\\Delta S_{conf} = \\mu_{ads}^\\circ + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\theta = q/q_{max}$ is the fractional surface coverage, $q$ is the amount adsorbed, $q_{max}$ is the monolayer capacity, and $\\mu_{ads}^\\circ$ is the standard chemical potential of the adsorbed species (related to the enthalpy of adsorption).\n\nEquating the chemical potentials:\n$$\n\\mu_g^\\circ + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p^\\circ}\\right) = \\mu_{ads}^\\circ + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right)\n$$\nRearranging gives:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu_g^\\circ - \\mu_{ads}^\\circ}{RT} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p^\\circ}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta_a G^\\circ}{RT} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p^\\circ}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_a G^\\circ = \\mu_{ads}^\\circ - \\mu_g^\\circ$ is the standard Gibbs free energy of adsorption.\nDefining an equilibrium constant for adsorption $K = \\exp(-\\Delta_a G^\\circ / RT)$, which will have units of inverse pressure if $p^\\circ$ is absorbed, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta} = K p\n$$\nHere, $p$ is treated as a dimensionless quantity $p/p^\\circ$, and $K$ is the corresponding dimensionless equilibrium constant. For practical fitting, we use $p$ in bars and an equilibrium constant $K_{ads}$ in $\\mathrm{bar}^{-1}$. Solving for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{K_{ads} p}{1 + K_{ads} p}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\theta = q/q_{max}$, we arrive at the two-parameter Langmuir equation:\n$$\nq(p) = \\frac{q_{max} K_{ads} p}{1 + K_{ads} p}\n$$\nThe two parameters to be estimated are the monolayer capacity, $q_{max} > 0$, and the Langmuir adsorption constant, $K_{ads} > 0$. This corresponds to $k=2$ parameters.\n\n**1.2. Model F: The Freundlich Isotherm**\n\nThis empirical model is used for heterogeneous surfaces where the adsorption energy is not constant. It can be theoretically justified by assuming an exponential distribution of adsorption site energies. If the number of sites with adsorption energy $E$ is proportional to $\\exp(-E/E_c)$, where $E_c$ is a characteristic energy, a formal integration over all sites, using a local Langmuir isotherm and certain approximations (e.g., the condensation approximation), leads to a power-law relationship between the amount adsorbed and the pressure. The resulting equation is:\n$$\nq(p) = C p^{n_F}\n$$\nThis is a two-parameter model with $k=2$. The parameter $C$ is a constant related to the adsorbent capacity and overall binding affinity, and it must be positive ($C > 0$). The exponent $n_F$ (often written as $1/m$ where $m>1$) is a measure of surface heterogeneity and is typically between $0$ and $1$ for physical adsorption, thus we assume $n_F > 0$. For dimensional consistency, the units of $C$ depend on the value of $n_F$.\n\n**1.3. Model T: The Temkin Isotherm**\n\nThe Temkin model accounts for indirect adsorbate-adsorbate interactions by assuming that the heat of adsorption, and consequently the Gibbs free energy of adsorption, decreases linearly with surface coverage, $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\Delta_a G^\\circ(\\theta) = \\Delta_a G^\\circ(0) + c\\theta\n$$\nwhere $c > 0$ for repulsive interactions. Substituting this coverage-dependent energy into the equilibrium expression from the Langmuir derivation:\n$$\nRT \\ln\\left(K_0 \\frac{p}{p^\\circ}\\right) = RT\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) + c\\theta\n$$\nwhere $K_0 = \\exp(-\\Delta_a G^\\circ(0)/RT)$. For intermediate coverages (not close to $0$ or $1$), the term $c\\theta$ often dominates the change with coverage compared to the logarithmic term. This leads to the approximation:\n$$\nRT \\ln\\left(K_0 \\frac{p}{p^\\circ}\\right) \\approx c\\theta\n$$\nSolving for $\\theta = q/q_{max}$ gives:\n$$\nq(p) \\approx \\frac{q_{max} RT}{c} \\ln\\left(K_0 \\frac{p}{p^\\circ}\\right) = \\frac{q_{max} RT}{c} \\left(\\ln(K_0) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p^\\circ}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis can be simplified into a general two-parameter linear-logarithmic form:\n$$\nq(p) = A + B \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p^\\circ}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants. This model has $k=2$ parameters. The parameter $B$ is expected to be positive, reflecting an increase in adsorption with pressure. The use of $p/p^\\circ$ with $p^\\circ = 1\\,\\mathrm{bar}$ makes the argument of the logarithm dimensionless.\n\n**2. Parameter Estimation and Model Selection**\n\nThe problem states that measurement errors are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian random variables with zero mean. Under this assumption, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for the model parameters is equivalent to minimizing the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS):\n$$\n\\mathrm{RSS} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( q_{obs,i} - q_{model}(p_i, \\vec{\\theta}) \\right)^2\n$$\nwhere $\\{q_{obs,i}, p_i\\}$ are the $n$ data points, $q_{model}$ is one of the three derived isotherm functions, and $\\vec{\\theta}$ is the vector of model parameters. For each dataset ($n=10$) and each model ($k=2$), we will find the parameters $\\hat{\\vec{\\theta}}$ that minimize RSS. This minimization will be performed using numerical optimization algorithms. For the Temkin model, which is linear in its parameters with respect to $\\ln(p)$, linear regression provides a direct analytical solution. For the Langmuir and Freundlich models, which are non-linear, an iterative optimization algorithm is required. To ensure physically meaningful parameters (e.g., $q_{max} > 0$), we can optimize over the logarithm of these parameters.\n\nModel selection will be based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC):\n$$\n\\mathrm{AIC} = 2k + n \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{RSS}}{n}\\right)\n$$\nFor each dataset, we compute the AIC for the best fit of each of the three models. The model with the lowest AIC is chosen as the best explanation for the data. Given $k=2$ and $n=10$ for all cases, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathrm{AIC} = 4 + 10 \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{RSS}}{10}\\right)\n$$\nSince AIC is a monotonically increasing function of RSS for fixed $n$ and $k$, selecting the model with the minimum AIC is equivalent to selecting the model with the minimum RSS. The specified tie-breaking procedure (first by $k$, then by RSS) will be implemented, though it is only relevant in the case of an exact numerical tie.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1. For each dataset ($D_1, D_2, D_3$):\n2. For each model (Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin):\n   a. Find the optimal parameters $\\hat{\\vec{\\theta}}$ that minimize the RSS. For Langmuir and Freundlich, this involves non-linear least squares optimization, seeded with initial guesses derived from linearized forms of the equations. For Temkin, this is achieved via linear regression of $q$ against $\\ln(p)$.\n   b. Calculate the minimized RSS value.\n3. For each dataset, collect the AIC values for the three models.\n4. Select the model index ($0$ for Langmuir, $1$ for Freundlich, $2$ for Temkin) corresponding to the minimum AIC, applying tie-breaking rules if necessary.\n5. Collate the indices for the three datasets into a final list.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{[0, 1, 2]}\n$$", "id": "2957498"}]}
