This is a standard application of group theory to molecular vibrations. The approach is systematic and begins with the construction of a reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{3N}$, based on the $3N$ Cartesian displacement coordinates of the atoms in the molecule.\n\nFirst, we must determine the characters, $\\chi_{3N}(R)$, of this total representation, $\\Gamma_{3N}$, for each symmetry class $R$ of the $T_d$ point group. The character for a given class is the product of the number of atoms left unshifted by an operation in that class, $N_R$, and the character of the transformation of a Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y,z)$ under that operation, $\\chi_{xyz}(R)$. The formula is $\\chi_{3N}(R) = N_R \\cdot \\chi_{xyz}(R)$. The molecule is $\\mathrm{CH_4}$, so the total number of atoms is $N=5$.\n\nThe classes of the $T_d$ point group are $E$, $8C_3$, $3C_2$, $6S_4$, and $6\\sigma_d$. The order of the group is $h = 1+8+3+6+6=24$.\n\nWe calculate the number of unshifted atoms, $N_R$, for an operation in each class:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $E$: The identity operation leaves all $5$ atoms unchanged. $N_E = 5$.\n    \\item $C_3$: A $C_3$ axis passes through the central carbon atom and one hydrogen atom. Thus, $2$ atoms are unshifted. $N_{C_3} = 2$.\n    \\item $C_2$: A $C_2$ axis passes through the central carbon atom, bisecting two H-C-H angles. Only the carbon atom is unshifted. $N_{C_2} = 1$.\n    \\item $S_4$: An $S_4$ axis is collinear with a $C_2$ axis. The operation involves a rotation by $90^\\circ$ and a reflection. Only the central carbon atom is unshifted. $N_{S_4} = 1$.\n    \\item $\\sigma_d$: A $\\sigma_d$ plane contains the central carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms. Thus, $3$ atoms are unshifted. $N_{\\sigma_d} = 3$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nNext, we determine the character $\\chi_{xyz}(R)$ for the transformation of a vector $(x,y,z)$ for each class:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $E$: Identity transformation matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The trace is $\\chi_{xyz}(E) = 3$.\n    \\item $C_n$: For a proper rotation by an angle $\\theta$, the character is $1 + 2\\cos(\\theta)$. For $C_3$, $\\theta = 120^\\circ$, so $\\chi_{xyz}(C_3) = 1 + 2\\cos(120^\\circ) = 1 + 2(-\\frac{1}{2}) = 0$.

For $S_4$, $\\theta = 90^\\circ$, so $\\chi_{xyz}(S_4) = -1 + 2\\cos(90^\\circ) = -1 + 0 = -1$.\n    \\item $\\sigma$: A reflection is equivalent to $S_1$, with $\\theta=360^\\circ$ which is not helpful. It is better to consider its matrix representation. Reflection in the $xy$-plane transforms $(x,y,z)$ to $(x,y,-z)$, with a trace of $1+1-1=1$. By symmetry, any reflection plane gives a trace of $1$. So, $\\chi_{xyz}(\\sigma_d) = 1$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nNow we can compute the characters for the total representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(E) = N_E \\cdot \\chi_{xyz}(E) = 5 \\times 3 = 15$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(C_3) = N_{C_3} \\cdot \\chi_{xyz}(C_3) = 2 \\times 0 = 0$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(C_2) = N_{C_2} \\cdot \\chi_{xyz}(C_2) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(S_4) = N_{S_4} \\cdot \\chi_{xyz}(S_4) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_d) = N_{\\sigma_d} \\cdot \\chi_{xyz}(\\sigma_d) = 3 \\times 1 = 3$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe character set for $\\Gamma_{3N}$ is thus $\\{15, 0, -1, -1, 3\\}$.\n\nThe total representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$ is a sum of the representations for translational, rotational, and vibrational motions: $\\Gamma_{3N} = \\Gamma_{\\text{trans}} + \\Gamma_{\\text{rot}} + \\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$. To find the vibrational representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$, we must subtract the translational and rotational representations from $\\Gamma_{3N}$.\n\nFrom the standard character table for $T_d$, the translational modes, which transform as the Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$, belong to the $T_2$ irreducible representation. The characters for $\\Gamma_{\\text{trans}}$ are $\\chi(T_2) = \\{3, 0, -1, -1, 1\\}$.\nThe rotational modes, which transform as $(R_x, R_y, R_z)$, belong to the $T_1$ irreducible representation.

The multiplicities are $n_{A_1}=1$, $n_{A_2}=0$, $n_E=1$, $n_{T_1}=0$, and $n_{T_2}=2$.\n\nA vibrational mode is IR active if it has the same symmetry as one of the components of the electric dipole moment, which transform as the Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$. In the $T_d$ point group, $(x,y,z)$ transform as the $T_2$ irreducible representation. Therefore, only vibrational modes of $T_2$ symmetry are IR active.\nFrom our decomposition, there are two distinct sets of modes with $T_2$ symmetry ($2T_2$). Each of these corresponds to a unique fundamental frequency that will appear in the infrared spectrum. Hence, the number of distinct IR-active fundamentals, $n_{\\mathrm{IR}}$, is $2$.\n\nThe final result is the set of integers $(n_{A_1}, n_{A_2}, n_{E}, n_{T_1}, n_{T_2}, n_{\\mathrm{IR}})$, which is $(1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2941982"}, {"introduction": "The position of a peak in an IR spectrum tells us about the energy of a vibration, but its intensity reveals information about the electronic changes during that motion.
