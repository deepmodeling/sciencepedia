Using only definitions and the structural information you established, compute the number of ordered pairs $(g,h)\\in G\\times G$ such that $gh\\neq hg$.\n\nReport as your final answer the number of such non-commuting ordered pairs. Provide the number exactly; no rounding is necessary and no units are required.", "solution": "We begin from geometric principles for the $C_{3v}$ point group. The identity is denoted by $E$. Let $r$ denote the $C_{3}$ proper rotation by an angle $2\\pi/3$ about the principal axis. Let $s$ denote a chosen vertical reflection plane. The action of $r$ on $s$ by conjugation rotates that mirror plane into another mirror plane, so from geometry we infer that there are $3$ distinct vertical mirrors related by $r$. Algebraically, this is captured by the facts that $r^{3}=E$, $s^{2}=E$, and conjugation by $r$ permutes the mirrors cyclically. A concise and geometrically faithful way to enumerate all elements is\n$$\nG=\\{E, r, r^{2}, s, rs, r^{2}s\\}.\n$$\nThat these are all distinct is guaranteed by the geometry: $E$ does nothing, $r$ and $r^{2}$ are the two nontrivial $C_{3}$ rotations, and there are $3$ mirror planes, which can be represented as $s, rs, r^{2}s$ because a rotation followed by reflection in a fixed plane is reflection in the rotated plane.\n\nNext we derive the composition rules. From geometry,\n- $r^{3}=E$ because three successive $2\\pi/3$ rotations give a full turn.\n- $s^{2}=E$ because reflecting twice in the same plane returns the original configuration.\n- A reflection reverses the sense of rotation. In group-theoretic terms, $srs=r^{-1}$, which follows from comparing the net effect of “reflect in plane $s$, rotate by $2\\pi/3$, reflect back in the same plane” with a pure rotation. Equivalently, $sr=r^{-1}s$ and $rs=sr^{-1}$.\n\nUsing these, we can multiply any pair of elements in $G$. It is convenient to keep the canonical forms $r^{a}$ and $r^{a}s$ for $a\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$. The following rules hold for all integers $a,b$ modulo $3$:\n- $r^{a}r^{b}=r^{a+b}$,\n- $r^{a}\\cdot r^{b}s=r^{a+b}s$,\n- $r^{a}s\\cdot r^{b}=r^{a-b}s$ because $sr^{b}=r^{-b}s$,\n- $r^{a}s\\cdot r^{b}s=r^{a-b}$ because $s r^{b} s=r^{-b}$.\n\nWith the ordered basis $\\{E, r, r^{2}, s, rs, r^{2}s\\}$, the full multiplication table is\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n\\cdot & E & r & r^{2} & s & rs & r^{2}s \\\\\n\\hline\nE & E & r & r^{2} & s & rs & r^{2}s \\\\\nr & r & r^{2} & E & rs & r^{2}s & s \\\\\nr^{2} & r^{2} & E & r & r^{2}s & s & rs \\\\\ns & s & r^{2}s & rs & E & r^{2} & r \\\\\nrs & rs & s & r^{2}s & r & E & r^{2} \\\\\nr^{2}s & r^{2}s & rs & s & r^{2} & r & E\n\\end{array}\n$$\nInternal consistency checks:\n- Closure: Every product in the table is one of the $6$ listed elements, so the set is closed under composition.\n- Identity: The row and column for $E$ reproduce the other factors, confirming $E$ is the identity.\n- Inverses: From the table, $r\\cdot r^{2}=E$ so $r^{-1}=r^{2}$, and each reflection $x\\in\\{s,rs,r^{2}s\\}$ satisfies $x\\cdot x=E$, so $x^{-1}=x$.\n- Orders: $r^{3}=E$ (since $r\\cdot r\\cdot r=E$ by reading across two steps), and $s^{2}=E$, $(rs)^{2}=E$, $(r^{2}s)^{2}=E$, so each reflection has order $2$.\n\nConjugacy classes follow from direct conjugation using the table and the relation that $srs=r^{-1}$:\n- The identity forms its own class: $\\{E\\}$.\n- The nontrivial rotations are conjugate: for instance, conjugating $r$ by $s$ gives $srs=r^{-1}=r^{2}$. Since $r$ and $r^2$ are inverses in an abelian subgroup, conjugating them by $r$ or $r^2$ leaves them unchanged. Thus $\\{r, r^{2}\\}$ is a class.\n- The reflections are conjugate among themselves. For example, conjugation of $s$ by $r$ gives $rsr^{-1} = rsr^2 = r(sr^2) = r(r^{-2}s) = r^{-1}s = r^2s$. Since $s$ is transformed into $r^2s$ by an element of the group, they are in the same class. Further conjugations show that $rs$ is also in this class. Thus $\\{s, rs, r^{2}s\\}$ is a class.\n\nTherefore, there are $3$ conjugacy classes.\n\nFinally, we compute the number of ordered pairs $(g,h)\\in G\\times G$ that do not commute. Let $|G|=6$. The number of commuting ordered pairs equals\n$$\n\\sum_{g\\in G} |C_{G}(g)|,\n$$\nwhere $C_{G}(g)=\\{h\\in G: hg=gh\\}$ is the centralizer of $g$.

This practice demonstrates that these tables are not arbitrary but are rigorously derived from fundamental mathematical principles known as the Great Orthogonality Theorem.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "First, we address the determination of the dimensions of the irreducible representations (irreps) of the $C_{3v}$ point group. The group order is given as $h=6$. The number of conjugacy classes is specified as $3$, these being $\\{E\\}$, $\\{2C_3\\}$, and $\\{3\\sigma_v\\}$. Two fundamental theorems of group representation theory govern the dimensions of the irreps.\n1. The number of irreducible representations of a group is equal to the number of its conjugacy classes. For $C_{3v}$, this number is $r=3$.\n2. The sum of the squares of the dimensions ($l_i$) of the irreducible representations is equal to the order of the group ($h$). This is often called the Great Orthogonality Theorem's dimensional corollary.\nMathematically, this is stated as:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{r} l_i^2 = h $$\nFor the group $C_{3v}$, we have $r=3$ and $h=6$. We must find a set of three positive integers $\\{l_1, l_2, l_3\\}$ that satisfies the equation:\n$$ l_1^2 + l_2^2 + l_3^2 = 6 $$\nA mandatory feature of any point group is the existence of a totally symmetric irreducible representation, which is always one-dimensional. Let us assign $l_1 = 1$. The equation then reduces to finding two positive integers $l_2$ and $l_3$ such that:\n$$ 1^2 + l_2^2 + l_3^2 = 6 $$\n$$ l_2^2 + l_3^2 = 5 $$\nThe only solution to this Diophantine equation in positive integers is the set $\\{1, 2\\}$, since $1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5$. The order is immaterial. Thus, the unique set of dimensions for the three irreducible representations of the $C_{3v}$ group is $\\{1, 1, 2\\}$. This means there are two one-dimensional irreps and one two-dimensional irrep. By convention, one-dimensional representations are labeled with the letter $A$ or $B$, and two-dimensional representations with the letter $E$.\n\nSecond, we construct the character table for $C_{3v}$ from first principles. The table will have $3$ rows for the irreps and $3$ columns for the classes. Let the irreps be denoted $\\Gamma_1$, $\\Gamma_2$, and $\\Gamma_3$ with dimensions $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$, and $l_3=2$, respectively. By convention, the totally symmetric representation is denoted $A_1$. The remaining $1D$ representation is $A_2$, and the $2D$ representation is $E$. The characters for the identity operation, $\\chi(E)$, are always equal to the dimension of the representation. The character table initially takes the form:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\nC_{3v} & E & 2C_3 & 3\\sigma_v \\\\\n\\hline\nA_1 & 1 & \\chi_1(C_3) & \\chi_1(\\sigma_v) \\\\\nA_2 & 1 & \\chi_2(C_3) & \\chi_2(\\sigma_v) \\\\\nE   & 2 & \\chi_3(C_3) & \\chi_3(\\sigma_v)\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe $A_1$ irrep is totally symmetric, meaning its characters are $+1$ for all symmetry operations. So, the first row is $(1, 1, 1)$.\nThe characters of the different irreducible representations must obey the orthogonality relation for rows (irreps):\n$$ \\sum_{R} N_R \\chi_i(R) \\chi_j^*(R) = h \\delta_{ij} $$\nHere, $R$ indexes the classes, $N_R$ is the number of elements in class $R$, and $\\chi_i(R)$ is the character of the $i$-th irrep for class $R$. For $C_{3v}$, the class sizes are $N_E=1$, $N_{C_3}=2$, and $N_{\\sigma_v}=3$.\nLet the unknown characters for the $A_2$ irrep be $a = \\chi_2(C_3)$ and $b = \\chi_2(\\sigma_v)$.\nThe orthogonality of $A_1$ and $A_2$ ($i=1, j=2$) yields:\n$$ (1)(1)(1) + (2)(1)(a) + (3)(1)(b) = 0 \\implies 1 + 2a + 3b = 0 $$\nThe normalization of the $A_2$ irrep ($i=j=2$) requires:\n$$ (1)(1)^2 + (2)(a)^2 + (3)(b)^2 = 6 \\implies 1 + 2a^2 + 3b^2 = 6 \\implies 2a^2 + 3b^2 = 5 $$\nSince $A_2$ is a one-dimensional representation, its characters for operations of order $k$ must be $k$-th roots of unity. More simply, for character tables of common point groups, these are integers, typically $\\pm 1$. We seek integer solutions for $a$ and $b$. From $1 + 2a + 3b = 0$, if we test $a=1$, we find $1 + 2(1) + 3b = 0 \\implies 3b = -3 \\implies b = -1$. Substituting this pair $(a,b) = (1, -1)$ into the normalization condition gives $2(1)^2 + 3(-1)^2 = 2 + 3 = 5$, which is correct. Therefore, the characters for the $A_2$ irrep are $(1, 1, -1)$.\nNow, let the unknown characters for the $E$ irrep be $c = \\chi_3(C_3)$ and $d = \\chi_3(\\sigma_v)$.\nThe orthogonality of $A_1$ and $E$ ($i=1, j=3$) requires:\n$$ (1)(1)(2) + (2)(1)(c) + (3)(1)(d) = 0 \\implies 2 + 2c + 3d = 0 $$\nThe orthogonality of $A_2$ and $E$ ($i=2, j=3$) requires:\n$$ (1)(1)(2) + (2)(1)(c) + (3)(-1)(d) = 0 \\implies 2 + 2c - 3d = 0 $$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $c$ and $d$:\n$$ 2c + 3d = -2 $$\n$$ 2c - 3d = -2 $$\nAdding these two equations gives $4c = -4$, so $c = -1$. Substituting $c = -1$ into the first equation gives $2(-1) + 3d = -2 \\implies -2 + 3d = -2 \\implies 3d = 0$, so $d=0$.\nThe characters for the $E$ irrep are thus $(2, -1, 0)$.\nThe complete character table for $C_{3v}$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\nC_{3v} & E & 2C_3 & 3\\sigma_v \\\\\n\\hline\nA_1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\nA_2 & 1 & 1 & -1 \\\\\nE   & 2 & -1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThird, we identify a minimal set of basis functions for each irrep. The Cartesian coordinate system is conventionally set with the $z$-axis aligned with the principal $C_3$ axis.\nFor the $A_1$ irrep, we seek a function that is invariant under all group operations (characters are all $+1$). The coordinate $z$ lies on the $C_3$ axis and within all $\\sigma_v$ planes, so it is unchanged by any operation. $E(z)=z$, $C_3(z)=z$, $\\sigma_v(z)=z$. Thus, $z$ transforms as $A_1$. A minimal basis is $\\{z\\}$.\nFor the $A_2$ irrep, we require a function that is symmetric with respect to $C_3$ but antisymmetric with respect to $\\sigma_v$. We define $R_z$ as the infinitesimal rotation about the $z$-axis. A rotation about the principal axis, $R_z$, is unchanged by another rotation about the same axis, so $C_3(R_z) = R_z$ (character $+1$). A reflection in a vertical plane $\\sigma_v$ reverses the sense of rotation, so $\\sigma_v(R_z) = -R_z$ (character $-1$). The characters of transformation for $R_z$ are $(1, 1, -1)$, which match the $A_2$ irrep. A minimal basis is $\\{R_z\\}$.\nFor the $E$ irrep, which is two-dimensional, we require a pair of functions that transform together. We test the pair of coordinates $(x, y)$.\nThe identity $E$ leaves them unchanged, represented by the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, whose trace is $2$.\nRotation $C_3$ by an angle $\\theta=2\\pi/3$ about the $z$-axis transforms $(x, y)$ according to the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & -\\sqrt{3}/2 \\\\ \\sqrt{3}/2 & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The trace is $\\cos\\theta + \\cos\\theta = 2\\cos(2\\pi/3) = 2(-1/2) = -1$.\nReflection $\\sigma_v$ across the $xz$-plane transforms $(x,y,z)$ to $(x,-y,z)$. The matrix for this transformation on the $(x, y)$ basis is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, with a trace of $1-1=0$.\nThe characters for the transformation of $(x, y)$ are $(2, -1, 0)$, matching the $E$ irrep. Therefore, the pair $(x, y)$ forms a basis for the $E$ representation. A minimal basis is $\\{(x, y)\\}$. Likewise, the pair of rotations about the $x$- and $y$-axes, $(R_x, R_y)$, also transforms as the $E$ irrep.\n\nFinally, we are required to form the character matrix $M$ with rows ordered as $A_1, A_2, E$ and columns ordered by classes $E, 2C_3, 3\\sigma_v$, and compute its determinant.\nUsing the character table derived above, the matrix $M$ is:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 2 & -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of this $3 \\times 3$ matrix is calculated as follows:\n$$ \\det(M) = 1 \\begin{vmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} - 1 \\begin{vmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} + 1 \\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} $$\n$$ \\det(M) = 1((1)(0) - (-1)(-1)) - 1((1)(0) - (-1)(2)) + 1((1)(-1) - (1)(2)) $$\n$$ \\det(M) = 1(0 - 1) - 1(0 + 2) + 1(-1 - 2) $$\n$$ \\det(M) = -1 - 2 - 3 $$\n$$ \\det(M) = -6 $$\nThe determinant is a pure number, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-6}$$", "id": "2957728"}, {"introduction": "This practice represents the culmination of the previous exercises, applying the developed theoretical tools to a tangible chemical problem.

Therefore, $3$ atoms are left unmoved by a $\\sigma_d$ operation. $N_{\\mathrm{unmoved}}(\\sigma_d) = 3$.\n\nNow we assemble the characters of the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(E) = N_{\\mathrm{unmoved}}(E) \\times \\chi_{\\mathrm{vec}}(E) = 5 \\times 3 = 15$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(C_3) = N_{\\mathrm{unmoved}}(C_3) \\times \\chi_{\\mathrm{vec}}(C_3) = 2 \\times 0 = 0$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(C_2) = N_{\\mathrm{unmoved}}(C_2) \\times \\chi_{\\mathrm{vec}}(C_2) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(S_4) = N_{\\mathrm{unmoved}}(S_4) \\times \\chi_{\\mathrm{vec}}(S_4) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_d) = N_{\\mathrm{unmoved}}(\\sigma_d) \\times \\chi_{\\mathrm{vec}}(\\sigma_d) = 3 \\times 1 = 3$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe character set for $\\Gamma_{3N}$ is therefore $(15, 0, -1, -1, 3)$.\n\nThe total representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$ is a sum of translational, rotational, and vibrational representations: $\\Gamma_{3N} = \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{trans}} \\oplus \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{rot}} \\oplus \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}}$. To find the vibrational representation $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}}$, we subtract the characters of translation and rotation from $\\Gamma_{3N}$.\n$$ \\chi_{\\mathrm{vib}}(R) = \\chi_{3N}(R) - \\chi_{\\mathrm{trans}}(R) - \\chi_{\\mathrm{rot}}(R) $$\nThe problem states that the translational vectors $(x, y, z)$ transform as the $T_2$ irreducible representation, and the rotational vectors $(R_x, R_y, R_z)$ transform as $T_1$. From the provided character table:\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{trans}} = \\chi(T_2) = (3, 0, -1, -1, 1)$.\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{rot}} = \\chi(T_1) = (3, 0, -1, 1, -1)$.\n\nWe calculate the characters for $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}}$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\chi_{\\mathrm{vib}}(E) = 15 - 3 - 3 = 9$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{\\mathrm{vib}}(C_3) = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{\\mathrm{vib}}(C_2) = -1 - (-1) - (-1) = 1$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{\\mathrm{vib}}(S_4) = -1 - (-1) - 1 = -1$.\n    \\item $\\chi_{\\mathrm{vib}}(\\sigma_d) = 3 - 1 - (-1) = 3$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe character set for the vibrational representation $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is $(9, 0, 1, -1, 3)$. The dimension of the vibrational space is $3N-6 = 3(5)-6 = 9$, which agrees with $\\chi_{\\mathrm{vib}}(E)$.\n\nFinally, we reduce $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ into its constituent irreducible representations using the standard reduction formula. The number of times an irreducible representation $\\Gamma_i$ is contained in $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is given by:\n$$ n_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{R} g(R) \\chi_i(R) \\chi_{\\mathrm{vib}}(R) $$\nwhere $h$ is the order of the group, and $g(R)$ is the number of elements in the class of operation $R$. For $T_d$, $h = 1 + 8 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 24$.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $A_1$: $n_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(9)(1) + 8(0)(1) + 3(1)(1) + 6(-1)(1) + 6(3)(1)] = \\frac{1}{24}[9 + 0 + 3 - 6 + 18] = \\frac{24}{24} = 1$.\n    \\item For $A_2$: $n_{A_2} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(9)(1) + 8(0)(1) + 3(1)(1) + 6(-1)(-1) + 6(3)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{24}[9 + 0 + 3 + 6 - 18] = \\frac{0}{24} = 0$.\n    \\item For $E$: $n_E = \\frac{1}{24}[1(9)(2) + 8(0)(-1) + 3(1)(2) + 6(-1)(0) + 6(3)(0)] = \\frac{1}{24}[18 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 0] = \\frac{24}{24} = 1$.\n    \\item For $T_1$: $n_{T_1} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(9)(3) + 8(0)(0) + 3(1)(-1) + 6(-1)(1) + 6(3)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{24}[27 + 0 - 3 - 6 - 18] = \\frac{0}{24} = 0$.\n    \\item For $T_2$: $n_{T_2} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(9)(3) + 8(0)(0) + 3(1)(-1) + 6(-1)(-1) + 6(3)(1)] = \\frac{1}{24}[27 + 0 - 3 + 6 + 18] = \\frac{48}{24} = 2$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThus, the vibrational representation decomposes as:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}} = \\mathrm{A}_1 \\oplus \\mathrm{E} \\oplus 2\\mathrm{T}_2 $$\nThe vibrational modes consist of one non-degenerate mode ($A_1$), one doubly-degenerate mode ($E$), and two triply-degenerate modes ($T_2$).\n\nA vibrational mode is infrared active if its irreducible representation is the same as one of the components of the dipole moment vector $(x, y, z)$, which transform as $T_2$. A mode is Raman active if its irreducible representation is the same as one of the components of the polarizability tensor (quadratic functions), which, as stated, span $A_1 \\oplus E \\oplus T_2$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $A_1$: non-degenerate, Raman active, IR inactive.\n    \\item $E$: doubly-degenerate, Raman active, IR inactive.\n    \\item $T_2$: triply-degenerate, both Raman active and IR active.\n\\end{itemize}\nThis completes the analysis as required by the problem.
