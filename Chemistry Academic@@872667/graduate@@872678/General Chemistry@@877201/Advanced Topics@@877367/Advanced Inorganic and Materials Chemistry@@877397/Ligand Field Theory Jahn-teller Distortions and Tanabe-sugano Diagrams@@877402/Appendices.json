This first exercise builds your foundational skills by guiding you through a derivation of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ orbital energies from the fundamental barycenter principle.

Using the framework of Ligand Field Theory (LFT), and starting from the definitions of the octahedral barycenter and the degeneracies of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ sets, derive the relative energetic positions of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ levels with respect to the barycenter.

It presents a standard application of Ligand Field Theory and is therefore valid for a full analysis. We shall proceed by deriving the required quantities from first principles, as is proper.\n\nThe central concept is the splitting of the five degenerate $d$-orbitals of a transition metal ion under the influence of an octahedral ligand field. In $O_h$ symmetry, these orbitals split into two sets: a triply degenerate set of lower energy, labeled $t_{2g}$, and a doubly degenerate set of higher energy, labeled $e_g$.\n\nThe barycenter, or the weighted-average energy of the orbitals, must be conserved. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the ligand field perturbs the orbital energies but does not add or remove energy from the system as a whole. Let the energy of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals relative to the barycenter be $E_{t_{2g}}$ and the energy of the $e_g$ orbitals be $E_{e_g}$. The degeneracies of these sets are $g(t_{2g})=3$ and $g(e_g)=2$. The barycenter rule is expressed mathematically as:\n$$g(t_{2g}) \\cdot E_{t_{2g}} + g(e_g) \\cdot E_{e_g} = 0$$\n$$3 E_{t_{2g}} + 2 E_{e_g} = 0$$\nThis is our first equation.\n\nThe octahedral crystal-field splitting parameter, $\\Delta_{o}$, is defined as the energy difference between the $e_g$ and $t_{2g}$ levels.\n$$E_{e_g} - E_{t_{2g}} = \\Delta_o$$\nThis is our second equation. We now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $E_{t_{2g}}$ and $E_{e_g}$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we express $E_{e_g}$ in terms of $E_{t_{2g}}$:\n$$E_{e_g} = E_{t_{2g}} + \\Delta_o$$\nSubstituting this into the first equation yields:\n$$3 E_{t_{2g}} + 2(E_{t_{2g}} + \\Delta_o) = 0$$\n$$3 E_{t_{2g}} + 2 E_{t_{2g}} + 2 \\Delta_o = 0$$\n$$5 E_{t_{2g}} = -2 \\Delta_o$$\n$$E_{t_{2g}} = -\\frac{2}{5} \\Delta_o = -0.4 \\Delta_o$$\nThe $t_{2g}$ orbitals are thus stabilized by an amount of $0.4\\,\\Delta_o$ relative to the barycenter.\n\nNow, we solve for $E_{e_g}$:\n$$E_{e_g} = E_{t_{2g}} + \\Delta_o = -\\frac{2}{5} \\Delta_o + \\Delta_o = \\frac{3}{5} \\Delta_o = +0.6 \\Delta_o$$\nThe $e_g$ orbitals are destabilized by an amount of $0.6\\,\\Delta_o$ relative to the barycenter. This completes the required derivation.\n\nThe problem specifies a low-spin $d^4$ configuration. In a low-spin octahedral complex, the field splitting $\\Delta_o$ is large enough to overcome the electron pairing energy. Therefore, electrons fill the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals completely before occupying the higher-energy $e_g$ orbitals. For a $d^4$ ion, all four electrons will occupy the $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\nThe electron configuration is therefore $(t_{2g})^4 (e_g)^0$.\n\nThe Crystal Field Stabilization Energy ($\\mathrm{CFSE}$) is the net energy change of the $d$-electrons relative to the barycenter. It is calculated by summing the energies of each electron.\n$$\\mathrm{CFSE} = n_{t_{2g}} \\cdot E_{t_{2g}} + n_{e_g} \\cdot E_{e_g}$$\nwhere $n_{t_{2g}}$ and $n_{e_g}$ are the numbers of electrons in the respective orbitals.\n$$\\mathrm{CFSE} = 4 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{2}{5} \\Delta_o\\right) + 0 \\cdot \\left(+\\frac{3}{5} \\Delta_o\\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{CFSE} = -\\frac{8}{5} \\Delta_o = -1.6 \\Delta_o$$\nNote that this calculation, as per the problem's directive, excludes the pairing energy ($P$) required to place two electrons in the same $t_{2g}$ orbital.\n\nA brief comment on the Jahn-Teller effect: The Jahn-Teller theorem predicts that a non-linear molecule with an electronically degenerate ground state will distort to remove this degeneracy and lower its energy. For a low-spin $d^4$ configuration, $(t_{2g})^4 (e_g)^0$, the $t_{2g}$ orbitals are asymmetrically occupied (e.g., $(d_{xy})^2 (d_{xz})^1 (d_{yz})^1$). This leads to a triply degenerate ground state term (${}^3T_{1g}$), so a Jahn-Teller distortion is indeed expected. However, distortions arising from degeneracy within the $t_{2g}$ set are typically weaker than those from degeneracy within the $e_g$ set.\n\nWe now proceed to the numerical calculation. The problem provides $\\Delta_o = 18000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nFirst, we find the $\\mathrm{CFSE}$ in units of wavenumbers ($\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$):\n$$\\mathrm{CFSE} = -1.6 \\times 18000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = -28800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nTo convert this energy to $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, we use the relation $E = hc\\bar{\\nu}$, where $E$ is the energy of a photon, $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\bar{\\nu}$ is the wavenumber. To find the molar energy, we multiply by Avogadro's constant, $N_A$.\n$$E_{\\text{molar}} = N_A h c \\bar{\\nu}$$\nWe assume the use of the following fundamental constants (CODATA 2018 values):\n- Planck's constant, $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- Speed of light in vacuum, $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Avogadro's constant, $N_A = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n\nThe wavenumber $\\bar{\\nu}$ must be in units of $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ for dimensional consistency.

It presents a standard, simplified model from ligand field theory and asks for derivations based on the provided definitions. It is therefore a valid problem. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of a $d^{5}$ transition metal ion in an octahedral ligand field. The five degenerate $d$ orbitals of the free ion are split into a lower-energy, triply degenerate $t_{2g}$ set and a higher-energy, doubly degenerate $e_{g}$ set. The energy difference between these sets is the octahedral crystal-field splitting energy, $\\Delta_{o}$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the energies of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ orbitals relative to the barycenter (the weighted average energy of the orbitals, which is set to zero). The total energy of the five $d$ orbitals must be conserved. Let $E_{t_{2g}}$ be the energy of one $t_{2g}$ orbital and $E_{e_{g}}$ be the energy of one $e_{g}$ orbital. There are $3$ orbitals in the $t_{2g}$ set and $2$ orbitals in the $e_{g}$ set. The barycenter condition is expressed as:\n$$3 \\cdot E_{t_{2g}} + 2 \\cdot E_{e_{g}} = 0$$\nThe energy splitting is defined as:\n$$\\Delta_{o} = E_{e_{g}} - E_{t_{2g}}$$\nWe can solve this system of two linear equations.

The five electrons will occupy each of the five $d$ orbitals singly before any pairing occurs.

The pairing energy, $P$, is the cost for each electron pair. In the $(t_{2g})^{3}(e_{g})^{2}$ configuration, there are zero electron pairs. Let $N_{p,HS}$ be the number of pairs. Then $N_{p,HS} = 0$.\nThe total energy for the high-spin case, $E_{HS}$, is:\n$$E_{HS} = CFSE_{HS} + N_{p,HS} \\cdot P = 0 + 0 \\cdot P = 0$$\n\nLow-Spin $d^{5}$ Case:\nIn the low-spin case, the crystal-field splitting energy $\\Delta_{o}$ is large enough to overcome the energy cost of electron pairing. Electrons will fill the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals completely before occupying the $e_{g}$ orbitals. This results in the electronic configuration $(t_{2g})^{5}(e_{g})^{0}$.\nThe CFSE for the low-spin case, $CFSE_{LS}$, is:\n$$CFSE_{LS} = (5 \\text{ electrons} \\times -\\frac{2}{5} \\Delta_{o}) + (0 \\text{ electrons} \\times +\\frac{3}{5} \\Delta_{o})$$\n$$CFSE_{LS} = -2\\Delta_{o}$$\nIn the $(t_{2g})^{5}$ configuration, the five electrons occupy three orbitals, resulting in two pairs and one unpaired electron.
