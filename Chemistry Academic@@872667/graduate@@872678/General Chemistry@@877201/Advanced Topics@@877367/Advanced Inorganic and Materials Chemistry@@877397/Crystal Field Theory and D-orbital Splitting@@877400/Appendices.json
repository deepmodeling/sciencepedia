The values are physically plausible. The problem is a standard, non-trivial application of Crystal Field Theory and is free of logical contradictions, pseudoscientific claims, or subjective elements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nAccording to Crystal Field Theory, in an octahedral ligand field, the $5$ degenerate $d$-orbitals split into two sets: the triply degenerate $t_{2g}$ orbitals and the doubly degenerate $e_g$ orbitals. The energy difference between these sets is the ligand field splitting parameter, $\\Delta_o$.\n\nThe barycenter rule dictates that the weighted average energy of the orbitals remains zero. Let $E(t_{2g})$ and $E(e_g)$ be the energies of the respective orbital sets relative to the barycenter. The conservation of energy is expressed as:\n$$3 \\cdot E(t_{2g}) + 2 \\cdot E(e_g) = 0$$\nThe energy separation is given by:\n$$E(e_g) - E(t_{2g}) = \\Delta_o$$\nSolving this system of two linear equations for the two unknown energies yields:\n$$E(t_{2g}) = -\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_o$$\n$$E(e_g) = +\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o$$\n\nFor a metal center with a $d^4$ electron configuration, two possible spin states exist: high spin and low spin. The preferred state is the one with the lower total electronic energy, which is a sum of the orbital energy contributions and the total pairing energy.\n\n**Case 1: High-Spin (HS) State**\nIn this configuration, Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity is followed. The first $3$ electrons occupy the $3$ separate $t_{2g}$ orbitals with parallel spins. The fourth electron occupies an $e_g$ orbital, also with a parallel spin, to maximize the total spin multiplicity.\n- Electron configuration: $(t_{2g})^3(e_g)^1$.\n- Number of electrons in $t_{2g}$ orbitals, $n_{t2g} = 3$.\n- Number of electrons in $e_g$ orbitals, $n_{eg} = 1$.\n- Number of paired electrons, $N_p = 0$.\nThe total electronic energy for the high-spin state, $E_{HS}$, is:\n$$E_{HS} = n_{t2g} \\cdot E(t_{2g}) + n_{eg} \\cdot E(e_g) + N_p \\cdot P$$\n$$E_{HS} = 3 \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) + 1 \\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) + 0 \\cdot P$$\n$$E_{HS} = -\\frac{6}{5}\\Delta_o + \\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o = -\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o$$\n\n**Case 2: Low-Spin (LS) State**\nIn this configuration, it is energetically more favorable to pair electrons in the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals than to promote an electron across the energy gap $\\Delta_o$. The first $3$ electrons singly occupy the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. The fourth electron pairs with one of the electrons already in a $t_{2g}$ orbital.\n- Electron configuration: $(t_{2g})^4(e_g)^0$.\n- Number of electrons in $t_{2g}$ orbitals, $n_{t2g} = 4$.\n- Number of electrons in $e_g$ orbitals, $n_{eg} = 0$.\n- Number of paired electrons, $N_p = 1$.\nThe total electronic energy for the low-spin state, $E_{LS}$, is:\n$$E_{LS} = n_{t2g} \\cdot E(t_{2g}) + n_{eg} \\cdot E(e_g) + N_p \\cdot P$$\n$$E_{LS} = 4 \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) + 0 \\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) + 1 \\cdot P$$\n$$E_{LS} = -\\frac{8}{5}\\Delta_o + P$$\n\n**Comparison of Energies**\nTo determine the ground state, we compare $E_{HS}$ and $E_{LS}$ using the provided values of $\\Delta_o = 16\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $P = 18\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n$$E_{HS} = -\\frac{3}{5}(16\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) = -3(3200\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) = -9\\,600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$$\n$$E_{LS} = -\\frac{8}{5}(16\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) + 18\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = -8(3200\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) + 18\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = -25\\,600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} + 18\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = -7\\,600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$$\nComparing the two energies: $E_{HS} = -9\\,600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $E_{LS} = -7\\,600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Since $-9\\,600  -7\\,600$, the high-spin state has a lower energy and is the ground state.\nThis result is consistent with the general principle that high-spin states are favored when the pairing energy is greater than the ligand field splitting ($P > \\Delta_o$), which is true in this case ($18\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} > 16\\,000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$).\nSince the ground state is high spin, the spin state variable is $s=1$.\n\n**Calculation of Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE)**\nThe problem defines CFSE as the stabilization energy arising only from the distribution of electrons in the split $d$-orbitals, excluding any pairing energy cost.

Assume the following physically realistic conditions.\n\n1. In an octahedral field, the $d$ orbitals split into a lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set and a higher-energy $e_g$ set separated by an energy $\\Delta_o$.

The same pairing energy $P$ applies.\n\n3. In a square-planar field derived from a strong tetragonal distortion of an octahedral field, take the one-electron orbital energy ordering to be $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ (degenerate, lowest), then $d_{z^2}$, then $d_{xy}$, and finally $d_{x^2-y^2}$ (highest).

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution based on the principles of crystal field theory. We will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe fundamental task is to determine the number of unpaired electrons, $n$, for a $d^5$ transition metal ion in three distinct ligand fields and then to calculate the corresponding spin-only magnetic moment, $\\mu_{so}$. The spin-only approximation assumes that the orbital angular momentum is quenched. The magnetic moment is given by the formula:\n$$ \\mu_{so} = g \\sqrt{S(S+1)} \\cdot \\mu_B $$\nwhere $S$ is the total spin quantum number, $g$ is the electron g-factor, and $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. The total spin is related to the number of unpaired electrons, $n$, by $S = \\frac{n}{2}$. The problem specifies using the approximation $g \\approx 2$. Substituting these into the formula yields a more direct relation:\n$$ \\mu_{so} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2}\\left(\\frac{n}{2}+1\\right)} \\cdot \\mu_B = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{n(n+2)}{4}} \\cdot \\mu_B = \\sqrt{n(n+2)} \\cdot \\mu_B $$\nOur objective thus reduces to finding $n$ for each geometry by distributing the $5$ d-electrons according to the provided orbital splitting diagrams and energy parameters. The electron configuration is governed by the Aufbau principle and Hund's rule, balanced by the interplay between the crystal field splitting energy ($\\Delta$) and the mean interelectronic pairing energy ($P$). An electron will occupy a higher-energy orbital if the energy cost of promotion is less than the energy cost of pairing ($P$).\n\nCase 1: Octahedral Geometry\nIn an octahedral ligand field, the five degenerate d-orbitals split into a lower-energy triply degenerate $t_{2g}$ set and a higher-energy doubly degenerate $e_g$ set. The energy separation is $\\Delta_o$. The problem provides the condition $\\Delta_o  P$. This inequality signifies that the energy cost to promote an electron from the $t_{2g}$ set to the $e_g$ set is less than the energy required to pair two electrons in the same $t_{2g}$ orbital. This defines a high-spin configuration.\nWe must place $5$ electrons.\n1. The first three electrons singly occupy the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals with parallel spins, according to Hund's rule. Configuration: $(t_{2g})^3$.\n2. For the fourth and fifth electrons, since $\\Delta_o  P$, it is energetically more favorable to place them into the higher-energy $e_g$ orbitals than to pair them in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. Thus, the fourth and fifth electrons singly occupy the two $e_g$ orbitals with spins parallel to the first three.\nThe final ground-state electron configuration is $(t_{2g})^3(e_g)^2$.\nIn this configuration, each of the five d-orbitals is singly occupied. Therefore, the number of unpaired electrons is $n_{oct} = 5$.\nThe corresponding spin-only magnetic moment is:\n$$ \\mu_{oct} = \\sqrt{5(5+2)} \\cdot \\mu_B = \\sqrt{35} \\cdot \\mu_B \\approx 5.9160... \\, \\mu_B $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $\\mu_{oct} = 5.916 \\, \\mu_B$.\n\nCase 2: Tetrahedral Geometry\nIn a tetrahedral field, the d-orbitals split into a lower-energy doubly degenerate $e$ set and a higher-energy triply degenerate $t_2$ set. The splitting energy is $\\Delta_t$. The problem states that for the same metal and ligand set, $\\Delta_t = \\frac{4}{9}\\Delta_o$.\nWe are given $\\Delta_o  P$. Since $\\Delta_t = \\frac{4}{9}\\Delta_o$, it is guaranteed that $\\Delta_t  P$. Tetrahedral complexes are almost invariably high-spin due to the small magnitude of $\\Delta_t$, and this condition confirms it for this specific problem.\nWe place $5$ electrons.\n1. The first two electrons singly occupy the two $e$ orbitals. Configuration: $(e)^2$.\n2. For the remaining three electrons, since $\\Delta_t  P$, they will singly occupy the three higher-energy $t_2$ orbitals.\nThe final ground-state electron configuration is $(e)^2(t_2)^3$.\nAs in the octahedral case, all five electrons are in separate orbitals and are therefore unpaired. The number of unpaired electrons is $n_{tet} = 5$.\nThe magnetic moment is identical to the high-spin octahedral case:\n$$ \\mu_{tet} = \\sqrt{5(5+2)} \\cdot \\mu_B = \\sqrt{35} \\cdot \\mu_B \\approx 5.916 \\, \\mu_B $$\n\nCase 3: Square Planar Geometry\nThe orbital energy ordering is given as $d_{xz}, d_{yz}$ (degenerate), followed by $d_{z^2}$, then $d_{xy}$, and finally $d_{x^2-y^2}$. The energies are specified as $E_{xz,yz}=0$, $E_{z^2}=\\Delta_1$, $E_{xy}=\\Delta_2$, and $E_{x^2-y^2}=\\Delta_3$. The energetic constraints are $0  \\Delta_1  \\Delta_2 \\ll \\Delta_3$ and $\\Delta_2  P  \\Delta_3$.\nWe fill the orbitals with $5$ electrons, comparing promotion energies with the pairing energy $P$.\n1. The first two electrons singly occupy the degenerate $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals. Configuration: $(d_{xz})^1(d_{yz})^1$.\n2. The third electron can either pair in the $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ set (cost $P$) or be promoted to the $d_{z^2}$ orbital (cost $\\Delta_1$). Since we are given $\\Delta_1  \\Delta_2  P$, it holds that $\\Delta_1  P$. Promotion is favored. Configuration: $(d_{xz})^1(d_{yz})^1(d_{z^2})^1$.\n3. The fourth electron can either pair in a lower orbital (cost $P$) or be promoted to the $d_{xy}$ orbital (cost $\\Delta_2$). Since we are given $\\Delta_2  P$, promotion is again favored. Configuration: $(d_{xz})^1(d_{yz})^1(d_{z^2})^1(d_{xy})^1$.\n4. The fifth electron has two primary options: promotion to the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital at a cost of $\\Delta_3$, or pairing in one of the already occupied orbitals at a cost of $P$. The problem explicitly states $P  \\Delta_3$. Therefore, pairing is the energetically favored process. The electron will pair in the lowest available energy level, which is the degenerate $d_{xz}, d_{yz}$ set at energy $E=0$.\nThe final configuration is $(d_{xz}, d_{yz})^3(d_{z^2})^1(d_{xy})^1$. This corresponds to one filled orbital (e.g., $(d_{xz})^2$) and three singly occupied orbitals ($(d_{yz})^1$, $(d_{z^2})^1$, $(d_{xy})^1$).\nThe number of unpaired electrons is $n_{sqp} = 3$.\nThe corresponding spin-only magnetic moment is:\n$$ \\mu_{sqp} = \\sqrt{3(3+2)} \\cdot \\mu_B = \\sqrt{15} \\cdot \\mu_B \\approx 3.8729... \\, \\mu_B $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $\\mu_{sqp} = 3.873 \\, \\mu_B$.\n\nSummary of results:\n- Octahedral ($d^5$, high-spin): $n_{oct} = 5$, $\\mu_{oct} \\approx 5.916 \\, \\mu_B$.\n- Tetrahedral ($d^5$, high-spin): $n_{tet} = 5$, $\\mu_{tet} \\approx 5.916 \\, \\mu_B$.\n- Square Planar ($d^5$): $n_{sqp} = 3$, $\\mu_{sqp} \\approx 3.873 \\, \\mu_B$.\nThe final answer will present these three numerical values in the specified order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 5.916  5.916  3.873 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2932657"}, {"introduction": "This final practice shifts from quantitative prediction to qualitative reasoning, delving into the physical origins of the d-orbital splitting pattern in a square-planar complex.

Using the electrostatic postulates of crystal field theory (CFT; Crystal Field Theory) and qualitative symmetry-overlap arguments from ligand field theory (LFT; Ligand Field Theory), reason from first principles as follows:\n\n- Orbitals with lobes directed along metal–ligand axes experience the largest Coulomb repulsion from ligand electron density and are most destabilized (most antibonding).\n- Removal or energetic decoupling of axial ligands relative to an octahedral parent diminishes repulsion along the $z$ axis and stabilizes metal $d$ orbitals with $z$ character.\n- Electron occupancy is determined by the competition between crystal field splitting and the electron pairing energy under strong-field conditions.\n\nWhich option best explains why $d_{x^2-y^2}$ becomes strongly antibonding and highest in energy in square-planar fields, and correctly rationalizes why $d^8$ metal ions are frequently stabilized in this geometry?\n\nA. $d_{x^2-y^2}$ lies largely perpendicular to the ligand directions in a square plane and thus overlaps weakly; it is the most stabilized orbital. A $d^8$ ion preferentially occupies $d_{x^2-y^2}$, gaining additional stabilization in square-planar symmetry.\n\nB. $d_{x^2-y^2}$ has lobes exactly along $\\pm x$ and $\\pm y$, maximizing direct $\\sigma$ antibonding with the in-plane ligands and becoming the highest-energy orbital. Removing the axial ligands stabilizes $z$-containing orbitals such as $d_{z^2}$ and reduces repulsion for $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$. The qualitative ordering under $\\sigma$-only fields is $d_{x^2-y^2} \\gg d_{xy} > d_{z^2} > d_{xz} \\approx d_{yz}$. Under strong-field conditions, a $d^8$ metal fully occupies the four lower-energy $d$ orbitals, leaving $d_{x^2-y^2}$ empty, yielding a large crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE; Crystal Field Stabilization Energy) that frequently favors the square-planar geometry.\n\nC. $d_{x^2-y^2}$ is strongly stabilized by $\\pi$ backbonding into ligand $\\pi^*$ orbitals in the plane, lowering it below $d_{z^2}$.

The conditions are idealized but not physically impossible or implausible as a model.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question that tests fundamental concepts in inorganic chemistry. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nWe begin by considering the five degenerate $d$ orbitals in a free metal ion: $d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$, $d_{z^2}$, and $d_{x^2-y^2}$. In a square-planar complex with ligands on the $\\pm x$ and $\\pm y$ axes, the electrostatic field from the ligand electron density removes this degeneracy.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital**: According to Guiding Principle 1, orbitals pointing directly at ligands experience the greatest repulsion. The lobes of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital are oriented precisely along the $x$ and $y$ axes, directly at the four $\\sigma$-donor ligands. This leads to maximum orbital overlap in a $\\sigma$-antibonding fashion, resulting in a severe destabilization. Consequently, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes the highest-energy molecular orbital derived from the $d$-subshell. In the language of group theory for the $D_{4h}$ point group, this orbital transforms as the $b_{1g}$ irreducible representation.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Orbitals with $z$ Character**: According to Guiding Principle 2, removing the two axial ligands from an octahedral parent complex stabilizes orbitals with $z$-character.\n    -   The $d_{z^2}$ orbital has its primary lobes along the $z$-axis. Removal of ligands from this axis drastically reduces the Coulombic repulsion it experiences, causing a significant drop in its energy from the high-energy $e_g$ level of the parent octahedron. It transforms as $a_{1g}$ in $D_{4h}$.\n    -   The $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals have lobes in the $xz$ and $yz$ planes, respectively. In an octahedral field, they are repelled by the axial ligands. In a square-planar field, this repulsion is eliminated, causing them to be stabilized. They remain degenerate and form the lowest-energy set of orbitals. They transform as the $e_g$ irreducible representation in $D_{4h}$ (note: the labels $e_g$ and $t_{2g}$ from $O_h$ symmetry are not the same as labels in $D_{4h}$).\n\n3.  **Analysis of the $d_{xy}$ orbital**: The lobes of the $d_{xy}$ orbital lie in the $xy$-plane but are directed *between* the $x$ and $y$ axes. It is therefore repelled by the four in-plane ligands, but to a lesser extent than the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. As it has no $z$ component, its energy is not significantly affected by the removal of axial ligands. It is destabilized relative to the free-ion barycenter and is typically found to be the second highest in energy, below $d_{x^2-y^2}$. It transforms as $b_{2g}$ in $D_{4h}$.\n\n4.  **Overall Energy Level Diagram**: Based on the analysis above, the qualitative energy ordering of the $d$ orbitals in a $\\sigma$-only square-planar field is:\n    $$E(d_{x^2-y^2}) \\gg E(d_{xy})  E(d_{z^2})  E(d_{xz}) = E(d_{yz})$$\n    A large energy gap, often denoted $\\Delta_{sp}$, exists between the highest-energy $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital and the set of four lower-lying orbitals.\n\n5.  **Rationalization for $d^8$ Ion Stability**: The problem specifies strong-field ligands (Guiding Principle 3). This implies that the crystal field splitting energy is large compared to the electron pairing energy. For a metal ion with a $d^8$ electron configuration, the $8$ electrons will populate the available orbitals to achieve the lowest possible energy state. Given the derived energy diagram, the $8$ electrons will fill the four lowest-energy orbitals: $(d_{xz})^2(d_{yz})^2(d_{z^2})^2(d_{xy})^2$. This configuration leaves the strongly antibonding $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital completely empty. The system thereby avoids a massive energetic penalty, leading to a large overall Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE). This large CFSE is a primary thermodynamic driving force for the common observation of square-planar geometry for $d^8$ metal ions, particularly those in the 2nd and 3rd transition series (e.g., $Rh(I), Ir(I), Pd(II), Pt(II), Au(III)$) and with strong-field ligands for the 1st transition series (e.g., $Ni(II)$ in $[Ni(CN)_4]^{2-}$).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A**: This option claims that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ lies \"perpendicular to the ligand directions\" and is \"most stabilized\". This is factually incorrect. The lobes of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital point directly at the ligands, leading to maximum repulsion and destabilization. The remainder of the option's reasoning is based on this false premise.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n-   **B**: This option correctly states that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital's lobes align with the ligands on the $\\pm x$ and $\\pm y$ axes, maximizing $\\sigma$ antibonding and making it the highest-energy orbital. It correctly identifies the stabilization of $z$-containing orbitals ($d_{z^2}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$) upon removal of axial ligands. It provides the accepted qualitative energy level ordering for a $\\sigma$-only square-planar field. Finally, it correctly explains that a $d^8$ ion fills the four lower orbitals, leaving the high-energy $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital empty, which results in a large CFSE that stabilizes this geometry. Every part of this statement is consistent with the derivation from first principles.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n-   **C**: This option invokes `π` backbonding as the primary stabilizing effect. The problem explicitly forbids this by stating to assume \"negligible $\\pi$ interactions\". Furthermore, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is of $\\sigma$ symmetry with respect to the metal-ligand bonds and cannot participate in `π` backbonding. The statement is fundamentally inconsistent with the problem's premises and with bonding theory.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n-   **D**: This option claims that removing axial ligands *raises* the energy of the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. This is the opposite of the correct effect. Removing the repulsive ligand electron density along the $z$-axis *lowers*, or stabilizes, the energy of the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. The reasoning is flawed.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n-   **E**: This option proposes that stabilization arises from maximized degeneracy and an entropic effect. This is false. A square-planar field *removes* degeneracy compared to a spherical or octahedral field, leading to multiple distinct energy levels. The stabilization of $d^8$ ions is a strong enthalpic effect (large CFSE) driven by orbital energy differences, not a configurational entropy effect. The claim that the stabilization is independent of orbital orientation and overlap contradicts the very foundation of CFT and LFT.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2932700"}]}
