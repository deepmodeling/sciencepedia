The problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is structured into three parts. We will address each in sequence.\n\nPart 1 requires the derivation of an expression for the solid–liquid work of adhesion, $W_{SL}$, in terms of the liquid–vapor surface tension, $\\gamma_{LV}$, and the equilibrium contact angle, $\\theta$.\n\nWe begin with Young's equation, which describes the mechanical equilibrium of interfacial tensions at the three-phase contact line for a liquid droplet on an ideal solid surface. The equation represents the balance of horizontal force components per unit length of the contact line:\n$$\n\\gamma_{SV} = \\gamma_{SL} + \\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma_{SV}$ is the solid–vapor interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{SL}$ is the solid–liquid interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{LV}$ is the liquid–vapor surface tension, and $\\theta$ is the Young equilibrium contact angle.\n\nNext, we consider the thermodynamic work of adhesion, $W_{SL}$, as defined by the Dupré equation. The work of adhesion is the reversible work done per unit area to separate a solid–liquid interface into a solid–vapor interface and a liquid–vapor interface. This work is equal to the net change in surface free energy accompanying the separation process:\n$$\nW_{SL} = \\gamma_{SV} + \\gamma_{LV} - \\gamma_{SL}\n$$\nThe objective is to eliminate the unknown solid surface tensions, $\\gamma_{SV}$ and $\\gamma_{SL}$, from this expression. We can rearrange the Dupré equation as:\n$$\nW_{SL} = (\\gamma_{SV} - \\gamma_{SL}) + \\gamma_{LV}\n$$\nFrom Young's equation, we can find a direct expression for the term $(\\gamma_{SV} - \\gamma_{SL})$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{SV} - \\gamma_{SL} = \\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the rearranged Dupré equation yields the desired expression, known as the Young–Dupré equation:\n$$\nW_{SL} = \\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta + \\gamma_{LV}\n$$\nFactoring out the term $\\gamma_{LV}$, we arrive at the final form:\n$$\nW_{SL} = \\gamma_{LV} (1 + \\cos\\theta)\n$$\n\nPart 2 requires the computation of $W_{SL}$ for the dehydroxylated (pristine) and hydroxylated alumina surfaces using the derived expression. We are given the following values: $\\gamma_{LV} = 71.97\\ \\mathrm{mN}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{pristine}} = 75.0^\\circ$, and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{hydrox}} = 30.0^\\circ$.\nThe unit $\\mathrm{mN}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ is dimensionally equivalent to $\\mathrm{mJ}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, as $1\\ \\mathrm{N} = 1\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, so $1\\ \\mathrm{mN}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} = 1\\ \\mathrm{mJ}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.

Our calculations show $W_{SL}^{\\mathrm{hydrox}}  W_{SL}^{\\mathrm{pristine}}$, indicating that the adhesion between water and alumina is significantly enhanced by surface hydroxylation. This phenomenon can be explained by examining the intermolecular forces at the interface.\n\nA dehydroxylated alumina ($\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$) surface, created by annealing, is terminated primarily by coordinatively unsaturated aluminum cations ($\\mathrm{Al}^{3+}$) and oxide anions ($\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$), forming aluminoxane bridges ($\\mathrm{Al-O-Al}$). The interactions between this surface and liquid water are dominated by Lewis acid-base interactions (where the electron-deficient $\\mathrm{Al}^{3+}$ sites act as Lewis acids and the oxygen atoms of water act as Lewis bases) and van der Waals forces. While these interactions are substantial, they lack the strong, directional character of hydrogen bonds.\n\nWhen the alumina surface is exposed to humidity, water molecules dissociatively chemisorb onto reactive surface sites. This process grafts terminal hydroxyl groups ($\\mathrm{Al-OH}$) onto the surface. The resulting hydroxylated surface is now populated with a high density of these groups.\n\nWater is a polar protic liquid that forms an extensive, dynamic three-dimensional hydrogen bond network. The crucial change upon hydroxylation is that the surface $\\mathrm{Al-OH}$ groups can now participate directly and effectively in this network. The hydrogen atom of an $\\mathrm{Al-OH}$ group can act as a hydrogen bond donor to the oxygen of a water molecule, and the oxygen atom of an $\\mathrm{Al-OH}$ group can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor for a hydrogen from a water molecule.\n\nThis creates a dense network of strong, directional hydrogen bonds directly at the solid-liquid interface. Hydrogen bonds are significantly stronger than the non-specific van der Waals forces and are a powerful adhesive interaction. The large increase in the work of adhesion, $\\Delta W_{SL} \\approx (134.3 - 90.60)\\ \\mathrm{mJ}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} = 43.7\\ \\mathrm{mJ}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, is the macroscopic manifestation of the collective energy of these newly formed interfacial hydrogen bonds. This strong adhesion pulls the liquid water molecules closer to the surface and encourages spreading, which is macroscopically observed as a decrease in the contact angle from $75.0^\\circ$ to $30.0^\\circ$. Thus, the grafting of hydroxyl groups transforms the surface chemistry from one that interacts with water primarily through moderate Lewis acid-base interactions to one that interacts through strong, specific hydrogen bonding, thereby substantially increasing the work of adhesion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n90.60  134.3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2945751"}, {"introduction": "Characterizing the full structure of nanomaterials, including both their inorganic core and organic surface ligands, is a central task in nanoscience.

This equation connects the translational diffusion coefficient, $D$, of a spherical particle in a fluid to the thermal energy and the viscous drag exerted by the fluid. As requested, we begin with the Einstein relation, which defines the diffusion coefficient in terms of the particle mobility, $\\mu$, and thermal energy, $k_B T$:\n$$D = \\mu k_B T$$\nThe mobility, $\\mu$, is the ratio of the particle's terminal drift velocity to a constant external force. For a particle in a viscous fluid, this force is balanced by the Stokes drag force, $F_{\\text{drag}} = f v$, where $f$ is the frictional coefficient. The mobility is therefore the reciprocal of the frictional coefficient, $\\mu = 1/f$. For a sphere of diameter $d_{h}$ moving in a continuum fluid under stick boundary conditions (where the fluid velocity at the particle surface is zero), the frictional coefficient is given by the Stokes law:\n$$f = 3 \\pi \\eta d_{h}$$\nCombining these relations yields the Stokes-Einstein equation:\n$$D = \\frac{k_B T}{3 \\pi \\eta d_{h}}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the hydrodynamic diameter, $d_{h}$:\n$$d_{h} = \\frac{k_B T}{3 \\pi \\eta D}$$\nWe must ensure consistent units for the calculation.
