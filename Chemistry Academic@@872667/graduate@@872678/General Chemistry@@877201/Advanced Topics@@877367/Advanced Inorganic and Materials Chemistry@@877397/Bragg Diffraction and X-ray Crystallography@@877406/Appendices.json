All necessary data are provided, and the questions are unambiguous. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis based on the principles of Bragg diffraction.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Bragg Condition and Calculation of the First-Order Angle\n\nConstructive interference for waves scattered from a periodic structure occurs when the path-length difference between waves scattered from adjacent repeating units is an integer multiple of the wavelength. In the context of a crystal, these repeating units are the parallel lattice planes.\n\nConsider two parallel X-rays incident upon two adjacent lattice planes separated by an interplanar spacing $d$. Let the angle of incidence and reflection with respect to the plane be the Bragg angle, $\\theta$. The second ray, which interacts with the lower plane, travels a longer path than the first ray, which interacts with the upper plane. The path-length difference, $\\Delta L$, is composed of two segments: an additional distance traveled by the second ray to reach the lower plane, and an additional distance it travels after reflection to reach a common wavefront with the first ray.\n\nBy simple geometric construction, it can be shown that each of these two segments has a length of $d \\sin(\\theta)$. The total path-length difference is the sum of these two segments.\n$$\n\\Delta L = d \\sin(\\theta) + d \\sin(\\theta) = 2d \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\nFor constructive interference, this path-length difference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength, $\\lambda$. This condition is expressed as:\n$$\n\\Delta L = n\\lambda\n$$\nwhere $n$ is a positive integer ($n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$) known as the order of the diffraction. Combining these two expressions yields the Bragg's law:\n$$\n2d \\sin(\\theta) = n\\lambda\n$$\nThis is the required relation linking $\\theta$, $d$, $\\lambda$, and $n$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the first-order angle, $\\theta_{1}$, which corresponds to $n=1$. The given values are $\\lambda = 0.15418 \\, \\text{nm}$ and $d = 0.2000 \\, \\text{nm}$.\nFor $n=1$, the equation becomes:\n$$\n2d \\sin(\\theta_{1}) = 1 \\cdot \\lambda\n$$\nSolving for $\\sin(\\theta_{1})$:\n$$\n\\sin(\\theta_{1}) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2d}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n\\sin(\\theta_{1}) = \\frac{0.15418}{2 \\times 0.2000} = \\frac{0.15418}{0.4000} = 0.38545\n$$\nTo find the angle $\\theta_{1}$, we compute the arcsine of this value:\n$$\n\\theta_{1} = \\arcsin(0.38545)\n$$\nThe calculation yields $\\theta_{1} \\approx 22.6738^\\circ$. The problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\theta_{1} \\approx 22.67^\\circ\n$$\n\nPart 2: Determination of the Maximum Diffraction Order\n\nThe Bragg relation, $2d \\sin(\\theta) = n\\lambda$, can be rearranged to solve for $\\sin(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{n\\lambda}{2d}\n$$\nThe sine function, for a physical angle $\\theta$ (where $0^\\circ \\le \\theta \\le 90^\\circ$), is bounded by $0 \\le \\sin(\\theta) \\le 1$. Therefore, a physically real solution for $\\theta$ can only exist if:\n$$\n\\frac{n\\lambda}{2d} \\le 1\n$$\nThis inequality places a constraint on the possible integer values of the diffraction order $n$. We can solve for $n$:\n$$\nn \\le \\frac{2d}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSince $n$ must be a positive integer, the maximum possible order, $n_{\\max}$, is the largest integer that satisfies this condition. This is equivalent to taking the floor of the expression on the right-hand side.\n$$\nn_{\\max} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2d}{\\lambda} \\right\\rfloor\n$$\nSubstituting the given values for $d$ and $\\lambda$:\n$$\nn_{\\max} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2 \\times 0.2000}{0.15418} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{0.4000}{0.15418} \\right\\rfloor\n$$\nCalculating the value of the fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{0.4000}{0.15418} \\approx 2.59437\n$$\nThe floor of this value is:\n$$\nn_{\\max} = \\lfloor 2.59437 \\rfloor = 2\n$$\nThus, the largest integer diffraction order that can be observed for this crystal with this X-ray wavelength is $2$. Orders $n=1$ and $n=2$ are physically possible, but $n=3$ and higher are not.

It presents a standard exercise in solid-state crystallography which can be solved through rigorous application of fundamental principles. We will proceed with the solution in two main parts: first, the determination of the Miller indices for the specified family of lattice planes, and second, the derivation and calculation of the corresponding interplanar spacing.\n\nThe Miller indices $(h, k, l)$ of a family of parallel lattice planes are defined as a set of three integers determined from the intercepts of a plane in the family with the crystallographic axes. The procedure is as follows:\n1.  Find the intercepts of the plane with the axes in terms of the lattice parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n2.  Take the reciprocals of these numbers.\n3.  Clear any fractions to obtain the smallest set of integers having the same ratio.\n\nThe problem states that a plane in the family has intercepts at $x=2a$, $y=-b$, and $z=\\frac{c}{3}$.\nStep 1: The intercepts, expressed as multiples of the respective lattice parameters, are $2$, $-1$, and $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 2: We take the reciprocals of these values:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{-1}, \\quad \\frac{1}{1/3}\n$$\nwhich gives the set of numbers:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad -1, \\quad 3\n$$\n\nStep 3: To obtain the smallest set of integers, we multiply each number by the least common multiple of their denominators, which is $2$:\n$$\nh = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = 1\n$$\n$$\nk = -1 \\times 2 = -2\n$$\n$$\nl = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n$$\nBy convention, a negative index is written with a bar over the number. Therefore, the Miller indices for this family of planes are $(hkl) = (1\\bar{2}6)$.\n\nNext, we must derive the formula for the interplanar spacing, $d_{hkl}$, for a primitive orthorhombic crystal system. We begin from the foundational relationship between the direct lattice and the reciprocal lattice.\n\nFor a crystal lattice defined by primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{c}$, the corresponding reciprocal lattice is defined by primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}^*$, $\\mathbf{b}^*$, and $\\mathbf{c}^*$. A vector in the reciprocal lattice can be written as $\\mathbf{G}_{hkl} = h\\mathbf{a}^* + k\\mathbf{b}^* + l\\mathbf{c}^*$, where $h$, $k$, and $l$ are integers. This vector $\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}$ is, by definition, normal to the family of lattice planes with Miller indices $(hkl)$. The interplanar spacing $d_{hkl}$ is related to the magnitude of this vector by the fundamental relation:\n$$\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}|}\n$$\nNote: The factor of $2\\pi$ is omitted here as is conventional in crystallographic, rather than solid-state physics, contexts. This is consistent with the definition of reciprocal vectors used below.\n\nFor a primitive orthorhombic lattice, the direct lattice vectors are mutually orthogonal: $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{c} \\cdot \\mathbf{a} = 0$. We can align them with a Cartesian coordinate system: $\\mathbf{a} = a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\mathbf{b} = b\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, and $\\mathbf{c} = c\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lattice parameters.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vectors are defined as $\\mathbf{a}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c}}{\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c})}$, $\\mathbf{b}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{c} \\times \\mathbf{a}}{\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c})}$, and $\\mathbf{c}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}}{\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c})}$. For the orthorhombic system, the volume of the unit cell is $V = \\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c}) = (a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) \\cdot (b\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\times c\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = abc$. The cross products are $\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c} = bc\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\mathbf{c} \\times \\mathbf{a} = ca\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, and $\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = ab\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\nSubstituting these into the definitions gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}^* = \\frac{bc\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}}{abc} = \\frac{1}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}^* = \\frac{ca\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}}{abc} = \\frac{1}{b}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{c}^* = \\frac{ab\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}{abc} = \\frac{1}{c}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nThe reciprocal lattice vectors for an orthorhombic system are also orthogonal, and their magnitudes are the reciprocals of the direct lattice parameters.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}$ for the $(hkl)$ planes is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G}_{hkl} = h \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\right) + k \\left(\\frac{1}{b}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\right) + l \\left(\\frac{1}{c}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\right) = \\frac{h}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\frac{k}{b}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\frac{l}{c}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nThe magnitude of this vector, $|\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}|$, is found using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions due to the orthogonality of the basis vectors:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{h}{a}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{k}{b}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{l}{c}\\right)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the interplanar spacing $d_{hkl} = 1/|\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}|$, we arrive at the required formula for an orthorhombic system, derived from first principles:\n$$\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{h^2}{a^2} + \\frac{k^2}{b^2} + \\frac{l^2}{c^2}}}\n$$\nThis derivation fulfills the requirements of the problem.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value for the interplanar spacing of the $(1\\bar{2}6)$ planes.

This practice [@problem_id:2924492] explores the observable consequences of these atomic displacements on a diffraction pattern. By analyzing how Bragg peak intensities and diffuse scattering change with temperature, you will learn to distinguish between dynamic thermal motion and static disorder, a critical skill for accurately interpreting experimental X-ray data and refining crystal structures.", "problem": "A single-crystal sample measured by X-ray crystallography (XRC) shows systematically weakened high-angle Bragg reflections and pronounced diffuse scattering superimposed between Bragg peaks. You collect integrated Bragg intensities $I_{hkl}(T)$ on the same crystal at three temperatures $T=\\{100\\,\\mathrm{K},\\,200\\,\\mathrm{K},\\,300\\,\\mathrm{K}\\}$ using the same wavelength and instrument geometry. Upon cooling from $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $100\\,\\mathrm{K}$, you observe that (i) the relative increase in $I_{hkl}$ is much larger at large scattering vector magnitude $s$ than at small $s$, where $s \\equiv 2\\sin\\theta/\\lambda$, and (ii) the diffuse background between Bragg peaks decreases substantially in intensity; the reciprocal-space pattern of the diffuse scattering remains similar in shape across temperatures.\n\nFrom first principles of scattering, the Bragg intensity is governed by the coherent structure factor of the time-averaged electron density, while the diffuse intensity encodes fluctuations about that average. Static disorder and thermal motion both lead to displacements away from ideal lattice positions, but they differ in their time dependence on the timescale of the X-ray scattering event and in how their statistics evolve with temperature.\n\nWhich option best captures the physical distinction between static disorder and thermal motion and proposes a physically sound, quantitative diagnostic using temperature-dependent intensity measurements that distinguishes them in a general crystal without assuming a specific force model?\n\nA. Thermal motion consists of time-dependent, zero-mean displacements about mean atomic positions that are sampled during the X-ray exposure, so the coherent structure factor is attenuated by a temperature-dependent average over the displacement distribution, with stronger attenuation at larger $s$. Static disorder consists of time-independent distributions of positions or occupancies across unit cells that do not evolve with temperature on the measurement timescale, so the coherent attenuation they cause is temperature independent. A practical diagnostic is to plot $\\ln\\!\\big(I_{hkl}(T_2)/I_{hkl}(T_1)\\big)$ versus $s^2$ for two temperatures $T_2>T_1$: for thermal motion this plot is linear with a negative slope (larger in magnitude at higher $T$), whereas for static disorder the slope is $0$. Concurrently, thermal diffuse scattering intensity increases with $T$ (approximately proportional to $T$ at sufficiently high $T$), whereas diffuse scattering from static disorder is temperature independent in magnitude and pattern.\n\nB. Both static disorder and thermal motion reduce high-angle Bragg intensities exclusively by broadening the Bragg peak widths in $2\\theta$ without changing integrated intensities, so their effects cannot be separated from temperature-dependent measurements of integrated intensities. The only reliable diagnostic is to measure unit-cell parameters versus temperature and attribute any intensity changes to thermal expansion; if the lattice constants do not change with $T$, any observed intensity changes must be due to static disorder.\n\nC. Static disorder is an anharmonic vibrational effect that increases with temperature, whereas thermal motion is purely harmonic and does not change with temperature. Therefore, a diagnostic is to measure low-angle Bragg intensities only: if low-angle intensities increase on cooling while high-angle intensities remain constant, the changes are due to static disorder; if both low- and high-angle intensities change equally with temperature, the changes are due to thermal motion.\n\nD. Static disorder and thermal motion are indistinguishable in X-ray diffraction because both represent displacements away from ideal positions; only neutron scattering can separate them. Therefore, temperature-dependent X-ray measurements cannot diagnose either one: one must replace carbon with deuterium and remeasure at the same temperature to determine whether the effect is static or thermal.\n\nE. Thermal motion changes occupancies with temperature because atoms move out of sites as $T$ increases, whereas static disorder preserves occupancies but changes the mean-square displacements. A diagnostic is that a refinement at different temperatures should show temperature-dependent occupancies for thermal motion and temperature-dependent displacement parameters for static disorder; the diffuse scattering is irrelevant in either case.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "We begin from the definition of the elastic scattering amplitude as the Fourier transform of the electron density. For a crystal with atoms labeled by $j$ at average positions $\\mathbf{R}_j$ and instantaneous displacements $\\mathbf{u}_j(t)$, the kinematic structure factor at scattering vector $\\mathbf{Q}$ is\n$$\nF(\\mathbf{Q}) \\;=\\; \\sum_j f_j(\\mathbf{Q}) \\left\\langle e^{i \\mathbf{Q}\\cdot(\\mathbf{R}_j + \\mathbf{u}_j)} \\right\\rangle,\n$$\nwhere $f_j(\\mathbf{Q})$ is the atomic form factor and $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the appropriate average for the measured intensity. The measured Bragg intensity is proportional to the coherent average squared, $I_{\\text{Bragg}}(\\mathbf{Q}) \\propto |F(\\mathbf{Q})|^2$, while the diffuse intensity $I_{\\text{diff}}(\\mathbf{Q})$ arises from fluctuations about the coherent average and scales with variances and correlations of $\\mathbf{u}_j$.\n\nThermal motion: On the timescale of X-ray scattering (femtoseconds), thermal vibrations are fast and effectively sampled, so the relevant average is a time (or thermal ensemble) average at temperature $T$. If displacements are zero-mean and approximately Gaussian with covariance tensor $\\mathbf{U}_j(T) = \\langle \\mathbf{u}_j \\mathbf{u}_j^{\\mathrm{T}} \\rangle_T$, then\n$$\n\\left\\langle e^{i \\mathbf{Q}\\cdot \\mathbf{u}_j} \\right\\rangle_T \\;=\\; \\exp\\!\\left( -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\mathbf{Q}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{U}_j(T)\\, \\mathbf{Q} \\right),\n$$\nso thermal motion multiplicatively attenuates each atomic contribution by a factor that increases in strength with both $|\\mathbf{Q}|$ and $T$ via the mean-square displacements.

Thus the total $I_{\\text{Bragg}}(\\mathbf{Q},T)$ is systematically more suppressed at larger $s$, and the suppression strengthens with increasing $T$. Comparing two temperatures $T_2>T_1$, one obtains\n$$\n\\ln\\!\\left[\\frac{I_{\\text{Bragg}}(\\mathbf{Q},T_2)}{I_{\\text{Bragg}}(\\mathbf{Q},T_1)}\\right] \\;=\\; -2\\sum_j w_j(\\mathbf{Q})\\, \\Delta M_j(T_2,T_1),\n$$\nwhere $w_j(\\mathbf{Q})$ are positive weights depending on $f_j$ and phase factors, and $\\Delta M_j$ scales with $Q^2$ (or $s^2$) through the change in $\\mathbf{U}_j$ between $T_1$ and $T_2$. Consequently, a plot of $\\ln\\!\\big(I(T_2)/I(T_1)\\big)$ versus $s^2$ is expected to be approximately linear with a negative slope when thermal motion is significant, with the magnitude of the slope increasing with $T_2-T_1$. Thermal motion also produces thermal diffuse scattering that increases with $T$; in the classical high-temperature limit for acoustic phonons, $I_{\\text{diff}}(\\mathbf{Q})$ is approximately proportional to $T$ away from Bragg positions.\n\nStatic disorder: Static disorder refers to a distribution of atomic positions or occupancies that is frozen on the timescale of measurement but varies from unit cell to unit cell. The coherent average for Bragg scattering is then an ensemble average across unit cells,\n$$\n\\left\\langle e^{i \\mathbf{Q}\\cdot (\\mathbf{R}_j + \\delta \\mathbf{r}_j)} \\right\\rangle_{\\text{cells}} \\;=\\; e^{i \\mathbf{Q}\\cdot \\mathbf{R}_j}\\,\\left\\langle e^{i \\mathbf{Q}\\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{r}_j} \\right\\rangle_{\\text{cells}},\n$$\nwhere $\\delta \\mathbf{r}_j$ is the static deviation from the ideal site. If the distribution of $\\delta \\mathbf{r}_j$ is $T$-independent, the resulting attenuation of $I_{\\text{Bragg}}$ is also $T$-independent. Static occupational disorder similarly reduces the coherent amplitude via average occupancies that do not change with $T$ on typical experimental ranges. The corresponding diffuse scattering from static disorder is set by the variance and spatial correlations of $\\delta \\mathbf{r}_j$ and $\\delta n_j$ (occupancy fluctuations) and is likewise $T$-independent in both magnitude and pattern if the disorder statistics do not evolve with $T$.\n\nDiagnostics from temperature-dependent measurements: The above considerations lead to two robust diagnostics.\n1. Bragg-intensity ratios: For two temperatures $T_2>T_1$, plot $\\ln\\!\\big(I_{hkl}(T_2)/I_{hkl}(T_1)\\big)$ versus $s^2$ over many reflections. Thermal motion yields an approximately linear negative trend because the change in mean-square displacements scales with $s^2$. Static disorder yields no $T$-dependence of the coherent attenuation, so the slope is $0$ within experimental error. This is essentially a differential Wilson analysis that cancels composition and form-factor effects.\n2. Diffuse scattering versus $T$: Map the integrated diffuse intensity in regions away from Bragg peaks as a function of $T$. Thermal diffuse scattering increases with $T$ (approximately $\\propto T$ at sufficiently high $T$), while diffuse scattering from static disorder is essentially $T$-independent if the disorder is frozen.\n\nThese principles directly explain the stated observations: enhanced high-$s$ sensitivity and a strong decrease of diffuse intensity upon cooling point to thermal motion as the dominant contributor; any residual, $T$-independent attenuation or diffuse component suggests an additional static-disorder contribution.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A correctly identifies thermal motion as time-dependent zero-mean displacements sampled during the measurement, producing a $T$-dependent attenuation that strengthens with $s$, and static disorder as $T$-independent positional or occupational distributions across unit cells. It proposes a quantitative and widely used diagnostic: the linear dependence of $\\ln\\!\\big(I(T_2)/I(T_1)\\big)$ on $s^2$ (nonzero slope for thermal motion, zero for static disorder) and the $T$-dependence of diffuse scattering (increasing with $T$ for thermal, constant for static). This aligns with the derivation above. Verdict: Correct.\n- Option B asserts that only peak widths change and that integrated intensities do not, which contradicts the basic result that the coherent structure factor is multiplicatively attenuated by displacement averages, changing integrated Bragg intensities strongly with $s$ and $T$. It also incorrectly reduces all effects to thermal expansion. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- Option C misidentifies static disorder as an anharmonic vibrational effect that increases with $T$ and thermal motion as $T$-independent, which inverts the physics. It also proposes a low-angle-only diagnostic that is insensitive to the characteristic $s^2$ dependence of displacement-induced attenuation. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- Option D claims indistinguishability by X-rays and necessity of neutron substitution. While neutrons offer complementary contrast, X-ray temperature-dependent measurements of Bragg and diffuse intensities, as derived, do distinguish thermal motion from static disorder through their $T$-dependences. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- Option E asserts that thermal motion changes occupancies with $T$, which is incorrect: occupancies are not altered by vibrational motion; rather, mean-square displacements change. It also dismisses diffuse scattering, which is a primary diagnostic for fluctuations. Verdict: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2924492"}]}
