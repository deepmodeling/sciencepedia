Carbon Efficiency (CE)\nThe definition of carbon efficiency is the ratio of the moles of carbon atoms in the final product to the total moles of carbon atoms in all reactants, based on the ideal stoichiometry.\n$$ CE = \\frac{\\text{moles of C in product}}{\\text{moles of C in reactants}} = \\frac{8}{7 + 19} = \\frac{8}{26} $$\n$$ CE \\approx 0.30769 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $CE = 0.3077$.\n\n3. Environmental Factor (E-factor)\nThe E-factor is defined as the total mass of waste generated per unit mass of product.\n$$ E = \\frac{\\text{Total mass of waste}}{\\text{Mass of product}} $$\nTo calculate this, we must first perform a complete mass balance for the actual process.\nMass of desired product (styrene, $m_{\\text{styr}}$):\nThe reaction is run with $0.300\\ \\mathrm{mol}$ of the limiting reagent (benzaldehyde) and achieves a fractional yield of $0.930$.\n$$ n_{\\text{styr}} = n_{\\text{benz}} \\times \\text{yield} = 0.300\\ \\mathrm{mol} \\times 0.930 = 0.279\\ \\mathrm{mol} $$\n$$ m_{\\text{styr}} = n_{\\text{styr}} \\times M_{\\text{styr}} = 0.279\\ \\mathrm{mol} \\times 104.152\\ \\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}} = 29.0584\\ \\mathrm{g} $$\n\nTotal mass of waste ($m_{\\text{waste}}$) is the sum of all materials that are not the final product.

Process Mass Intensity (PMI)\nPMI is defined as the ratio of the total mass of all materials put into the process to the mass of the final product.\n$$ PMI = \\frac{\\text{Total mass input}}{\\text{Mass of product}} $$\nIt can also be expressed in terms of the E-factor. By conservation of mass, Total Mass Input = Mass of Product + Total Mass of Waste.\n$$ PMI = \\frac{m_{\\text{product}} + m_{\\text{waste}}}{m_{\\text{product}}} = 1 + \\frac{m_{\\text{waste}}}{m_{\\text{product}}} = 1 + E $$\nUsing the calculated E-factor:\n$$ PMI = 1 + 415.21 \\approx 416.21 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $PMI = 416.2$.\n\nJustification: Why a high percent yield does not guarantee a low E-factor.\nThe E-factor is expressed as $E = m_{\\text{waste}}/m_{\\text{product}}$. The total waste mass, $m_{\\text{waste}}$, can be decomposed into two components: waste from the chemical transformation itself ($m_{\\text{waste, reaction}}$, which includes byproducts and unreacted starting materials) and waste from auxiliary materials ($m_{\\text{waste, aux}}$, which includes solvents, purification media, etc.).\n$$ E = \\frac{m_{\\text{waste, reaction}} + m_{\\text{waste, aux}}}{m_{\\text{product}}} $$\nThe percent yield directly impacts the quantities in this ratio. A high yield maximizes the mass of the product, $m_{\\text{product}}$ (the denominator), and minimizes the reaction-specific waste, $m_{\\text{waste, reaction}}$ (part of the numerator). While a high yield is beneficial, it has no effect on the mass of auxiliary materials, $m_{\\text{waste, aux}}$.\n\nIn the present case, the isolated product mass is $m_{\\text{product}} \\approx 29.1\\ \\mathrm{g}$. The reaction-derived waste (TPPO and unreacted reagents) is $m_{\\text{waste, reaction}} \\approx 94.0\\ \\mathrm{g}$. However, the auxiliary waste from solvents and solids is $m_{\\text{waste, aux}} \\approx 11971.5\\ \\mathrm{g}$. The total waste is therefore overwhelmingly dominated by the auxiliary materials, which constitute $\\frac{11971.5}{12065.5} \\approx 99.2\\%$ of the total waste stream.\nEven if the reaction proceeded with a perfect $100\\%$ yield, $m_{\\text{product}}$ would increase only slightly to $31.2\\ \\mathrm{g}$ and $m_{\\text{waste, reaction}}$ would decrease slightly, but the enormous mass of auxiliary waste ($11971.5\\ \\mathrm{g}$) would remain unchanged. The E-factor would still be exceedingly large. Consequently, a high percent yield, while improving atom utilization within the core transformation, is insufficient to ensure a \"green\" or efficient process (low E-factor) when the mass of auxiliary materials is disproportionately large compared to the mass of reactants and products. Process efficiency is a function of both reaction performance and the material intensity of the overall protocol, including workup and purification.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2723 & 0.3077 & 415.2 & 416.2 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2949799"}, {"introduction": "Effective green process design often involves choosing between multiple synthetic pathways.

From these masses, the Process Mass Intensity ($PMI$) and Environmental Factor ($E$-factor) are calculated under two different accounting conventions.\n\nThe fundamental definitions are:\n$$\n\\text{PMI} = \\frac{\\sum M_{inputs, credited}}{\\ M_{product}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{E-factor} = \\frac{\\sum M_{waste}}{\\ M_{product}}\n$$\nBy conservation of mass, the total input to a process must equal the total output. The credited inputs are equal to the sum of product mass and waste mass.\n$$\n\\sum M_{inputs, credited} = M_{product} + M_{waste}\n$$\nFrom this, a direct relationship is established:\n$$\n\\text{PMI} = \\frac{M_{product} + M_{waste}}{M_{product}} = 1 + \\frac{M_{waste}}{M_{product}} = 1 + \\text{E-factor}\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass of all materials charged to the reactor, $M_{in, total}$.\n$$\nM_{in, total} = M_A + M_B + M_{Cat} + M_{S1} + M_{S2} + M_{Water} + M_{Brine} + M_{Aid} + M_{Drying}\n$$\n$$\nM_{in, total} = 150.0 + 120.0 + 6.0 + 500.0 + 300.0 + 800.0 + 200.0 + 12.0 + 15.0 = 2103.0\\ \\mathrm{kg}\n$$\nThe mass of isolated product is given as $M_P = 240.0\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the mass of all materials that are internally recycled. We categorize these into non-solvents and solvents as per the problem definition.\n\nMass of recycled non-solvents, $M_{recycle, NS}$:\n- Recycled Reagent B: $M_{recycle, B} = 8.0\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Recycled Catalyst: $M_{recycle, Cat} = 0.80 \\times M_{Cat} = 0.80 \\times 6.0\\ \\mathrm{kg} = 4.8\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\nTotal recycled non-solvents:\n$$\nM_{recycle, NS} = 8.0 + 4.8 = 12.8\\ \\mathrm{kg}\n$$\n\nMass of recycled solvents, $M_{recycle, S}$:\n- Recycled Solvent S1: $M_{recycle, S1} = (0.90 \\times M_{S1}) \\times 0.70 = (0.90 \\times 500.0) \\times 0.70 = 315.0\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Recycled Solvent S2: $M_{recycle, S2} = 0.60 \\times M_{S2} = 0.60 \\times 300.0 = 180.0\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Recycled Brine: $M_{recycle, Brine} = 0.50 \\times M_{Brine} = 0.50 \\times 200.0 = 100.0\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\nTotal recycled solvents:\n$$\nM_{recycle, S} = 315.0 + 180.0 + 100.0 = 595.0\\ \\mathrm{kg}\n$$\n\nWith these quantities, we can now compute the metrics for each convention. Waste is defined as any material input that does not end up as product or a credited recycled stream.\n$M_{waste} = M_{in, total} - M_P - M_{recycle, credited}$\n\n**Convention 0: \"Without solvent credit\"**\nIn this convention, only the recycle of non-solvents is credited. The mass of credited recycled material is $M_{recycle, credited, 0} = M_{recycle, NS} = 12.8\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe mass of waste, $M_{waste, 0}$, is:\n$$\nM_{waste, 0} = M_{in, total} - M_P - M_{recycle, NS} = 2103.0 - 240.0 - 12.8 = 1850.2\\ \\mathrm{kg}\n$$\nNow we compute the metrics, denoted with subscript $0$:\n$$\nE_{0} = \\frac{M_{waste, 0}}{M_P} = \\frac{1850.2}{240.0} \\approx 7.709167\n$$\n$$\nPMI_{0} = 1 + E_{0} = 1 + 7.709167 \\approx 8.709167\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $E_{0} = 7.709$ and $PMI_{0} = 8.709$.\n\n**Convention 1: \"With solvent credit\"**\nIn this convention, the recycle of both non-solvents and solvents is credited. The mass of credited recycled material is $M_{recycle, credited, 1} = M_{recycle, NS} + M_{recycle, S}$.\n$$\nM_{recycle, credited, 1} = 12.8 + 595.0 = 607.8\\ \\mathrm{kg}\n$$\nThe mass of waste, $M_{waste, 1}$, is:\n$$\nM_{waste, 1} = M_{in, total} - M_P - (M_{recycle, NS} + M_{recycle, S}) = 2103.0 - 240.0 - 607.8 = 1255.2\\ \\mathrm{kg}\n$$\nNow we compute the metrics, denoted with subscript $1$:\n$$\nE_{1} = \\frac{M_{waste, 1}}{M_P} = \\frac{1255.2}{240.0} = 5.23\n$$\n$$\nPMI_{1} = 1 + E_{1} = 1 + 5.23 = 6.23\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $E_{1} = 5.230$ and $PMI_{1} = 6.230$.\n\n**Justification for Reporting Conventions**\n\nThe two conventions serve different but complementary purposes in the evaluation of process sustainability.\n1.  **Reporting without solvent credit ($PMI_0, E_0$)**: This convention provides a measure of the intrinsic mass efficiency of the chemical transformation and its associated purification steps, independent of site-specific recycling capabilities. It reflects the total mass load the process chemistry places upon the plant infrastructure. A high value for $PMI_0$ or $E_0$ encourages chemists to redesign the fundamental process to be less material-intensive, for example, by reducing solvent volumes, improving reaction yield, or eliminating auxiliary materials. It is a metric for evaluating the \"greenness\" of the core process design.\n2.  **Reporting with solvent credit ($PMI_1, E_1$)**: This convention reflects the actual performance of the process as implemented, including the benefits of engineering controls and recovery systems. It quantifies the net material consumption and waste generation for a manufacturing campaign, which is more directly related to operational costs and environmental emissions. This metric incentivizes investment in and optimization of technologies for solvent recovery, catalyst recycling, and reagent reuse. It is a metric for evaluating the operational efficiency and the effectiveness of capital investment in sustainability.\n\nTogether, these two views allow for a comprehensive assessment, distinguishing between the inherent efficiency of the chemistry and the efficiency of its industrial implementation.\n\nThe final numerical results are:\n$PMI_0 = 8.709$\n$E_0 = 7.709$\n$PMI_1 = 6.230$\n$E_1 = 5.230$\nThe required reporting order is $\\{\\mathrm{PMI}_{0}, \\mathrm{E}_{0}, \\mathrm{PMI}_{1}, \\mathrm{E}_{1}\\}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 8.709 & 7.709 & 6.230 & 5.230 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2940234"}]}
