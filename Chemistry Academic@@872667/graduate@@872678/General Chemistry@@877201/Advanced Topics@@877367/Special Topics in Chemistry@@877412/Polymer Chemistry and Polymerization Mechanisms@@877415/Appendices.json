Let $N_A$ and $N_B$ be the initial number of molecules of each monomer type. The total number of initial monomer molecules is $N_{total} = N_A + N_B$.\nThe initial number of functional groups are $A_0 = 2N_A$ and $B_0 = 2N_B$. Therefore, $N_{total} = \\frac{A_0}{2} + \\frac{B_0}{2}$.\nThe stoichiometric ratio is given as $r = B_0/A_0$.\nThe extent of reaction, $p$, is defined as the fraction of the limiting functional groups ($B$) that have reacted.\nThe number of $B$ groups reacted is $pB_0$. Due to the $1:1$ reaction stoichiometry, the number of $A$ groups reacted is also $pB_0$.\nEach reaction consumes two functional groups and reduces the number of molecules in the system by one. The total number of functional groups reacted is $2pB_0$. The total number of reactions that have occurred is half this value, which is $pB_0$.\nThe number of molecules at time $t$, $N_t$, is the initial number of molecules minus the number of reactions.\n$$ N_t = N_{total} - pB_0 = \\left(\\frac{A_0}{2} + \\frac{B_0}{2}\\right) - pB_0 $$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $N_{total}$ and $N_t$ into the definition of $\\overline{X_n}$.\n$$ \\overline{X_n} = \\frac{\\frac{A_0}{2} + \\frac{B_0}{2}}{\\left(\\frac{A_0}{2} + \\frac{B_0}{2}\\right) - pB_0} $$\nTo express this in terms of $r$, we divide the numerator and denominator by $A_0/2$.\n$$ \\overline{X_n} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{B_0}{A_0}}{1 + \\frac{B_0}{A_0} - \\frac{2pB_0}{A_0}} $$\nSubstituting $r = B_0/A_0$ yields the Carothers equation for non-stoichiometric systems:\n$$ \\overline{X_n} = \\frac{1+r}{1+r-2pr} $$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nNext, we calculate the target number-average degree of polymerization, $\\overline{X_n}_{,target}$, required to achieve the target number-average molecular weight, $M_n$.

The maximum theoretical degree of polymerization, $\\overline{X_n}_{,max}$, is achieved when the limiting reactant is completely consumed, i.e., at $p=1$.\n$$ \\overline{X_n}_{,max} = \\frac{1+r}{1+r-2r(1)} = \\frac{1+r}{1-r} $$\nWith $r = 0.98$, the ceiling value is:\n$$ \\overline{X_n}_{,max} = \\frac{1+0.98}{1-0.98} = \\frac{1.98}{0.02} = 99 $$\nThe target degree of polymerization is $\\overline{X_n}_{,target} = 80$. Since $\\overline{X_n}_{,target}  \\overline{X_n}_{,max}$ (specifically, $80  99$), the target is theoretically achievable.
