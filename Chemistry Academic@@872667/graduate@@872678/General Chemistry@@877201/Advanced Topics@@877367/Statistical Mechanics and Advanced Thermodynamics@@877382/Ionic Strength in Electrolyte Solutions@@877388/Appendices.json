The language is objective and precise. The problem contains no scientific fallacies, contradictions, or ambiguities. It is a standard, solvable problem in an academic context.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. We will proceed to the solution.\n\nThe ionic strength, $I$, of a solution is a measure of the total concentration of ions. It is defined by the following expression, which accounts for the concentration, $c_i$, and the charge number, $z_i$, of each ionic species $i$ in the solution:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} c_i z_i^2$$\nThe problem states that the three salts, $\\text{NaCl}$, $\\text{CaCl}_{2}$, and $\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4}$, dissociate completely in the aqueous solution. We must first write the stoichiometric dissociation reactions to determine the concentration of each ion.\nThe dissociation reactions are:\n$$ \\text{NaCl}(s) \\rightarrow \\text{Na}^{+}(aq) + \\text{Cl}^{-}(aq) $$\n$$ \\text{CaCl}_{2}(s) \\rightarrow \\text{Ca}^{2+}(aq) + 2\\text{Cl}^{-}(aq) $$\n$$ \\text{Na}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4}(s) \\rightarrow 2\\text{Na}^{+}(aq) + \\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}(aq) $$\nGiven the analytical concentrations of the salts, and assuming complete dissociation, the molar concentrations of the individual ions are calculated. Note that both $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ions originate from more than one source.\nLet $c(\\text{salt})$ denote the analytical concentration of a given salt. The ion concentrations, denoted by brackets, are:\n$$ [\\text{Na}^{+}] = c_{\\text{Na}^{+}} = c(\\text{NaCl}) + 2 \\cdot c(\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4}) $$\n$$ [\\text{Ca}^{2+}] = c_{\\text{Ca}^{2+}} = c(\\text{CaCl}_{2}) $$\n$$ [\\text{Cl}^{-}] = c_{\\text{Cl}^{-}} = c(\\text{NaCl}) + 2 \\cdot c(\\text{CaCl}_{2}) $$\n$$ [\\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}] = c_{\\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}} = c(\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4}) $$\nThe charge numbers ($z_i$) for these ions are: $z_{\\text{Na}^{+}} = +1$, $z_{\\text{Ca}^{2+}} = +2$, $z_{\\text{Cl}^{-}} = -1$, and $z_{\\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}} = -2$.\n\nThe explicit expression for the ionic strength $I$ of this specific mixture is obtained by substituting the concentrations and charges of all four ionic species into the definition of $I$:\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( c_{\\text{Na}^{+}} z_{\\text{Na}^{+}}^2 + c_{\\text{Ca}^{2+}} z_{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}^2 + c_{\\text{Cl}^{-}} z_{\\text{Cl}^{-}}^2 + c_{\\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}} z_{\\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}}^2 \\right) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the ion concentrations in terms of the initial salt concentrations yields:\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (c(\\text{NaCl}) + 2c(\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4}))(+1)^2 + (c(\\text{CaCl}_{2}))(+2)^2 + (c(\\text{NaCl}) + 2c(\\text{CaCl}_{2}))(-1)^2 + (c(\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4}))(-2)^2 \\right) $$\nThis is the derived explicit expression for $I$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically. First, we calculate the concentration of each ion:\n$$ c_{\\text{Na}^{+}} = 0.02000~\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} + 2 \\cdot (0.01000~\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}) = 0.04000~\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} $$\n$$ c_{\\text{Ca}^{2+}} = 0.005000~\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} $$\n$$ c_{\\text{Cl}^{-}} = 0.02000~\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} + 2 \\cdot (0.005000~\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}) = 0.03000~\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} $$\n$$ c_{\\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}} = 0.01000~\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} $$\nWe now substitute these concentrations and the corresponding charges into the ionic strength formula:\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (0.04000)(+1)^2 + (0.005000)(+2)^2 + (0.03000)(-1)^2 + (0.01000)(-2)^2 \\right] $$\nUnits of $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$ are omitted during the intermediate calculation for clarity.\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 0.04000 \\cdot 1 + 0.005000 \\cdot 4 + 0.03000 \\cdot 1 + 0.01000 \\cdot 4 \\right] $$\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 0.04000 + 0.02000 + 0.03000 + 0.04000 \\right] $$\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 0.13000 \\right] $$\n$$ I = 0.065000~\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.065000$ has five significant figures. Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.06500$.\n\nThe final part of the problem requires an explanation for the disproportionate contribution of divalent ions to ionic strength. This is a direct consequence of the mathematical form of the definition of $I$. The contribution of any given ion $i$ to the sum within the formula is $c_i z_i^2$. The charge number $z_i$ is squared.\nFor a monovalent ion ($z_i = \\pm 1$), its contribution to the sum is $c_i (\\pm 1)^2 = c_i$.\nFor a divalent ion ($z_i = \\pm 2$), its contribution to the sum is $c_i (\\pm 2)^2 = 4c_i$.\nThus, on a per-mole basis, a divalent ion contributes four times more to the ionic strength than a monovalent ion.\nIn our specific case:\n- Total concentration of monovalent ions ($\\text{Na}^{+}$, $\\text{Cl}^{-}$) is $0.04000 + 0.03000 = 0.07000~\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$. Their contribution to the sum $\\sum c_i z_i^2$ is $0.04000 \\cdot 1^2 + 0.03000 \\cdot (-1)^2 = 0.07000$.\n- Total concentration of divalent ions ($\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, $\\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}$) is $0.005000 + 0.01000 = 0.01500~\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$. Their contribution to the sum is $0.005000 \\cdot 2^2 + 0.01000 \\cdot (-2)^2 = 0.02000 + 0.04000 = 0.06000$.\nDespite the total concentration of divalent ions ($0.01500~\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$) being less than a quarter of the total concentration of monovalent ions ($0.07000~\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$), their contribution to the ionic strength sum ($0.06000$) is nearly as large as that from the monovalent ions ($0.07000$). This demonstrates unequivocally the disproportionately large influence of higher-charge ions, which stems from the quadratic dependence of ionic strength on ionic charge.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.06500}\n$$", "id": "2942689"}, {"introduction": "With the ability to calculate ionic strength, we can now explore its profound impact on chemical equilibria.

It contains sufficient information and is grounded in the established principles of chemical thermodynamics. We shall proceed with the derivation and subsequent calculation.\n\nFirst, we derive the general relationship between molar solubility, the thermodynamic solubility product, and ionic activity coefficients for a sparingly soluble $2{:}2$ electrolyte, denoted as $MX$. The dissolution equilibrium is:\n$$MX(s) \\rightleftharpoons M^{2+}(aq) + X^{2-}(aq)$$\nAccording to the fundamental principles provided, at equilibrium, the change in Gibbs free energy for the reaction, $\\Delta_r G$, is zero. The change in Gibbs energy is expressed in terms of the chemical potentials, $\\mu_i$, of the species involved:\n$$\\Delta_r G = \\mu_{M^{2+}} + \\mu_{X^{2-}} - \\mu_{MX(s)} = 0$$\nThe chemical potential of a pure solid is its standard chemical potential, $\\mu_{MX(s)} = \\mu_{MX(s)}^{\\circ}$. For an ion $i$ in solution, its chemical potential is given by $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_i$, where $\\mu_i^{\\circ}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $a_i$ is the activity of the ion. Substituting these expressions into the equilibrium condition yields:\n$$(\\mu_{M^{2+}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{M^{2+}}) + (\\mu_{X^{2-}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{X^{2-}}) - \\mu_{MX(s)}^{\\circ} = 0$$\nRearranging this equation separates the standard and non-standard terms:\n$$\\mu_{M^{2+}}^{\\circ} + \\mu_{X^{2-}}^{\\circ} - \\mu_{MX(s)}^{\\circ} = -RT(\\ln a_{M^{2+}} + \\ln a_{X^{2-}}) = -RT \\ln(a_{M^{2+}} a_{X^{2-}})$$\nThe left side of the equation is the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction, $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ}$. The thermodynamic equilibrium constant for this reaction, which is the solubility product $K_{\\mathrm{sp}}$, is related to $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ}$ by $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K_{\\mathrm{sp}}$. Therefore, we establish the definition of the thermodynamic solubility product in terms of activities:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{sp}} = a_{M^{2+}} a_{X^{2-}}$$\nThe activity $a_i$ of a solute is related to its molar concentration $c_i$ and its ionic activity coefficient $\\gamma_i$ by $a_i = \\gamma_i (c_i/c^{\\circ})$, where $c^{\\circ}$ is the standard state concentration, specified as $1\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$. Let $S$ be the molar solubility of the salt $MX$. In a solution where the only source of ions $M^{2+}$ and $X^{2-}$ is the dissolution of $MX$, their concentrations are $c_{M^{2+}} = S$ and $c_{X^{2-}} = S$.

To calculate $\\gamma_{\\pm}$, we must first determine the ionic strength $I$ of the medium. The ionic strength is defined as $I = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i} c_i z_i^2$. The solution contains ions from the fully dissociated background electrolyte $\\mathrm{NaNO_3}$ ($c_{\\mathrm{Na^+}} = 0.100\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$, $c_{\\mathrm{NO_3^-}} = 0.100\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$) and from the dissolved $\\mathrm{BaSO_4}$ ($c_{\\mathrm{Ba^{2+}}} = S$, $c_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}} = S$). The problem permits the assumption that the contribution of $\\mathrm{BaSO_4}$ to the ionic strength is negligible. We proceed with this approximation and will justify it a posteriori.\nThe ionic strength is thus dominated by the background electrolyte:\n$$I \\approx I_{\\mathrm{NaNO_3}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( c_{\\mathrm{Na^+}} z_{\\mathrm{Na^+}}^2 + c_{\\mathrm{NO_3^-}} z_{\\mathrm{NO_3^-}}^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (0.100)(+1)^2 + (0.100)(-1)^2 \\right) = 0.100\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$$\nWe use the specified Davies equation to estimate the individual ionic activity coefficients for $\\mathrm{Ba^{2+}}$ and $\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}$:\n$$\\log_{10}(\\gamma_i) = -A z_i^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}} - 0.3 I \\right)$$\nFor both $\\mathrm{Ba^{2+}}$ ($z=+2$) and $\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}$ ($z=-2$), the charge number squared is $z_i^2 = 4$.

Since $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Ba^{2+}}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}}$, the mean ionic activity coefficient is $\\gamma_{\\pm} = \\sqrt{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Ba^{2+}}} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}}} = \\gamma_i \\approx 0.37320$.\n\nThe solubility in the real model, $S_{\\mathrm{real}}$, is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{real}} = \\frac{c^{\\circ} \\sqrt{K_{\\mathrm{sp}}}}{\\gamma_{\\pm}} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{ideal}}}{\\gamma_{\\pm}} \\approx \\frac{1.0488 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}}{0.37320} \\approx 2.8099 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$$\nNow, we must justify the initial approximation. The contribution of dissolved $\\mathrm{BaSO_4}$ to the ionic strength is $I_{\\mathrm{BaSO_4}} = \\frac{1}{2}(S_{\\mathrm{real}}(+2)^2 + S_{\\mathrm{real}}(-2)^2) = 4S_{\\mathrm{real}} \\approx 4 \\times (2.8099 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 1.12 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$. Comparing this to the ionic strength of the background electrolyte, $I_{\\mathrm{NaNO_3}} = 0.100\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$, we find the contribution from $\\mathrm{BaSO_4}$ is only about $0.11\\%$ of the total. This is a negligible amount, and the approximation is therefore quantitatively justified.\n\nThe problem asks for the factor by which the ideal model underestimates or overestimates the true molar solubility. This factor is the ratio $\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{real}}}{S_{\\mathrm{ideal}}}$.\n$$\\text{Factor} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{real}}}{S_{\\mathrm{ideal}}} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{ideal}} / \\gamma_{\\pm}}{S_{\\mathrm{ideal}}} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{\\pm}}$$\n$$\\text{Factor} = \\frac{1}{0.37320} \\approx 2.6795$$\nSince this factor is greater than $1$, the ideal model underestimates the true solubility. The presence of the inert electrolyte screens the electrostatic attraction between $\\mathrm{Ba^{2+}}$ and $\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}$ ions, lowering their activities and, by Le Châtelier's principle, shifting the equilibrium to favor further dissolution.

The mass balance equations for the magnesium and sulfate moieties are:\n$$[\\text{Mg}]_{\\text{T}} = [\\text{Mg}^{2+}] + [\\text{MgSO}_4^0] = C$$\n$$[\\text{SO}_4]_{\\text{T}} = [\\text{SO}_4^{2-}] + [\\text{MgSO}_4^0] = C$$\nFrom these balances, the equilibrium concentrations of the free ions can be expressed in terms of $C$ and $x$:\n$$[\\text{Mg}^{2+}] = C - x$$\n$$[\\text{SO}_4^{2-}] = C - x$$\nIt is clear that for a physically meaningful solution, the concentration $x$ must be bounded such that $0 \\le x \\le C$.\n\nThe association equilibrium is described by the law of mass action, with the concentration-based association constant $K_{\\text{c}}$:\n$$K_{\\text{c}} = \\frac{[\\text{MgSO}_4^0]}{[\\text{Mg}^{2+}][\\text{SO}_4^{2-}]}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the equilibrium concentrations yields:\n$$K_{\\text{c}} = \\frac{x}{(C - x)(C - x)} = \\frac{x}{(C - x)^2}$$\nTo find $x$, we must solve this equation. Rearranging it gives a quadratic equation in $x$:\n$$K_{\\text{c}}(C - x)^2 = x$$\n$$K_{\\text{c}}(C^2 - 2Cx + x^2) = x$$\n$$K_{\\text{c}}x^2 - (2K_{\\text{c}}C + 1)x + K_{\\text{c}}C^2 = 0$$\nThis is a standard quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with coefficients:\n$a = K_{\\text{c}}$\n$b = -(2K_{\\text{c}}C + 1)$\n$c = K_{\\text{c}}C^2$\n\nThe solutions for $x$ are given by the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$x = \\frac{(2K_{\\text{c}}C + 1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-(2K_{\\text{c}}C + 1))^2 - 4(K_{\\text{c}})(K_{\\text{c}}C^2)}}{2K_{\\text{c}}}$$\nSimplifying the term under the square root (the discriminant):\n$$\\Delta = (2K_{\\text{c}}C + 1)^2 - 4K_{\\text{c}}^2C^2 = (4K_{\\text{c}}^2C^2 + 4K_{\\text{c}}C + 1) - 4K_{\\text{c}}^2C^2 = 4K_{\\text{c}}C + 1$$\nSo, the two mathematical solutions for $x$ are:\n$$x = \\frac{2K_{\\text{c}}C + 1 \\pm \\sqrt{4K_{\\text{c}}C + 1}}{2K_{\\text{c}}}$$\nWe must select the physically valid root. The root with the plus sign is $x_1 = \\frac{2K_{\\text{c}}C + 1 + \\sqrt{4K_cC+1}}{2K_{\\text{c}}}$. Since $\\sqrt{4K_cC+1}  0$, the numerator is greater than $2K_cC+1$. This implies $x_1  \\frac{2K_cC+1}{2K_c} = C+\\frac{1}{2K_c}$, which violates the physical constraint $x \\le C$. Therefore, this root is rejected.\n\nThe correct, physically meaningful root uses the minus sign:\n$$x = \\frac{2K_{\\text{c}}C + 1 - \\sqrt{4K_{\\text{c}}C + 1}}{2K_{\\text{c}}}$$\nThis solution is valid for $K_{\\text{c}}  0$. In the special case where $K_{\\text{c}} = 0$, there is no association, so $x = [\\text{MgSO}_4^0] = 0$. This result can also be obtained by taking the limit of the expression for $x$ as $K_{\\text{c}} \\to 0$, which yields an indeterminate form $0/0$ that resolves to $0$ via L'Hôpital's rule.\n\nNext, we compute the ionic strengths. The definition of ionic strength is $I = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sum_i c_i z_i^2$. The ions present are $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ($z = +2$) and $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ ($z = -2$).\n\n$1$. Analytical Ionic Strength ($I_{\\text{analytical}}$): This is a hypothetical value calculated by assuming the salt is completely dissociated, so $[\\text{Mg}^{2+}] = C$ and $[\\text{SO}_4^{2-}] = C$.\n$$I_{\\text{analytical}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( [\\text{Mg}^{2+}] (+2)^2 + [\\text{SO}_4^{2-}] (-2)^2 \\right)$$\n$$I_{\\text{analytical}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( C \\cdot 4 + C \\cdot 4 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(8C) = 4C$$\n\n$2$. Free Ionic Strength ($I_{\\text{free}}$): This is the true ionic strength of the solution at equilibrium, using the actual free ion concentrations $[\\text{Mg}^{2+}] = C-x$ and $[\\text{SO}_4^{2-}] = C-x$. The neutral species $\\text{MgSO}_4^0$ does not contribute ($z=0$).\n$$I_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (C-x) (+2)^2 + (C-x) (-2)^2 \\right)$$\n$$I_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (C-x) \\cdot 4 + (C-x) \\cdot 4 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(8(C-x)) = 4(C-x)$$\n\n$3$. Difference ($I_{\\text{analytical}} - I_{\\text{free}}$): The difference between these two values is:\n$$I_{\\text{analytical}} - I_{\\text{free}} = 4C - 4(C-x) = 4C - 4C + 4x = 4x$$\nThis result is intuitive: the formation of one mole of the neutral ion pair removes one mole of a $+2$ ion and one mole of a $-2$ ion, thus reducing the total ionic strength by an amount of $\\frac{1}{2}(1 \\cdot (+2)^2 + 1 \\cdot (-2)^2) = 4$.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case $(C, K_{\\text{c}})$ is therefore:\nA. Calculate $x = [\\text{MgSO}_4^0]$. If $K_{\\text{c}}=0$, $x=0$. Otherwise, use the derived formula.\nB. Calculate $I_{\\text{analytical}} = 4C$.\nC. Calculate $I_{\\text{free}} = 4(C-x)$.\nD. Calculate the difference $\\Delta I = 4x$.\nE. Report the rounded triplet $(I_{\\text{analytical}}, I_{\\text{free}}, \\Delta I)$.\nThis procedure will be implemented in the program.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the difference between analytical and free ionic strength\n    for a magnesium sulfate solution considering ion pairing.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple (C, K_c), where:\n    # C is the analytical concentration in mol/L.\n    # K_c is the association constant in L/mol.\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.10, 10.0),          # Case 1\n        (0.10, 0.0),           # Case 2\n        (1.00, 10.0),          # Case 3\n        (0.010, 1000.0),       # Case 4\n        (1.0e-6, 1.0e6),       # Case 5\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for C, K_c in test_cases:\n        # Step 1: Compute the equilibrium concentration of the ion pair, x = [MgSO4^0].\n        # The governing equation is a quadratic: K_c*x^2 - (2*K_c*C + 1)*x + K_c*C^2 = 0\n        if K_c == 0.0:\n            # If K_c is 0, no association occurs, so the concentration of the ion pair is 0.\n            x = 0.0\n        else:\n            # Solve the quadratic equation for x using the derived formula for the\n            # physically meaningful root.\n            # x = (2*K_c*C + 1 - sqrt((2*K_c*C + 1)^2 - 4*K_c^2*C^2)) / (2*K_c)\n            # Simplifies to:\n            # x = (2*K_c*C + 1 - sqrt(4*K_c*C + 1)) / (2*K_c)\n            discriminant_term = 4.0 * K_c * C + 1.0\n            x = (2.0 * K_c * C + 1.0 - np.sqrt(discriminant_term)) / (2.0 * K_c)\n\n        # Step 2: Compute the analytical ionic strength (I_analytical).\n        # Assumes complete dissociation: [Mg^2+] = C, [SO4^2-] = C.\n        # I = 0.5 * (C*(+2)^2 + C*(-2)^2) = 0.5 * (4C + 4C) = 4C.\n        I_analytical = 4.0 * C\n\n        # Step 3: Compute the free ionic strength (I_free).\n        # Uses equilibrium concentrations: [Mg^2+]_free = C - x, [SO4^2-]_free = C - x.\n        # I_free = 0.5 * ((C-x)*(+2)^2 + (C-x)*(-2)^2) = 4*(C-x).\n        I_free = 4.0 * (C - x)\n\n        # Step 4: Compute the difference.\n        # diff = I_analytical - I_free = 4C - 4(C-x) = 4x.\n        diff = 4.0 * x\n        \n        # Step 5: Round results to 6 decimal places and store.\n        rounded_result = [\n            round(I_analytical, 6),\n            round(I_free, 6),\n            round(diff, 6)\n        ]\n        results.append(rounded_result)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format '[[...],[...],...]'.\n    # The map(str, results) converts each inner list to its string representation.\n    # The ','.join(...) joins these strings with a comma.\n    # The f-string wraps the final joined string in '[' and ']'.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2942675"}]}
