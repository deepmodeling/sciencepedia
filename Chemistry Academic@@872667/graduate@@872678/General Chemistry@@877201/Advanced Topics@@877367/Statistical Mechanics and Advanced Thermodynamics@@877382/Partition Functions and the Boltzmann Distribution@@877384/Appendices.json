It is a standard, fundamental problem in statistical mechanics that can be solved from first principles. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing information. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe canonical partition function for a single, distinguishable particle, denoted as $q$, is defined as a sum over all of its quantum states, indexed by $j$. The sum is of the Boltzmann factors, $\\exp(-\\beta E_j)$, where $E_j$ is the energy of state $j$ and $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}$, with $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ being the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the absolute temperature.\n$$\nq = \\sum_{j} \\exp(-\\beta E_j)\n$$\nFor a non-interacting particle, the total energy is the sum of energies from its independent modes of motion. In this case, we are concerned only with translational motion. The quantum states for a particle of mass $m$ confined to a three-dimensional cubic box of side length $L$ are described by three positive integer quantum numbers: $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$. The energy eigenvalues $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z}$ are given by the solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system:\n$$\nE_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) \\quad \\text{where } n_x, n_y, n_z \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}\n$$\nHere, $h$ is the Planck constant.\n\nThe translational partition function, $q_{\\mathrm{trans}}$, is obtained by summing over all possible combinations of these quantum numbers.\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{trans}} = \\sum_{n_x=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_y=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_z=1}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left[ -\\beta E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the energy gives:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{trans}} = \\sum_{n_x=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_y=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_z=1}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left[ -\\frac{\\beta h^2}{8mL^2}(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) \\right]\n$$\nBecause the energy is a sum of three independent terms, the triple summation can be separated into a product of three identical, independent summations, one for each spatial dimension:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{trans}} = \\left( \\sum_{n_x=1}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left[ -\\frac{\\beta h^2 n_x^2}{8mL^2} \\right] \\right) \\left( \\sum_{n_y=1}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left[ -\\frac{\\beta h^2 n_y^2}{8mL^2} \\right] \\right) \\left( \\sum_{n_z=1}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left[ -\\frac{\\beta h^2 n_z^2}{8mL^2} \\right] \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{trans}} = \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left[ -\\frac{\\beta h^2 n^2}{8mL^2} \\right] \\right)^3\n$$\nThe problem asks for a solution in the thermodynamic limit, meaning a macroscopic volume $V = L^3$ and typical laboratory temperatures. Under these conditions, the side length $L$ is very large. This has a critical consequence: the energy levels are extremely closely spaced. The energy gap between adjacent levels, $\\Delta E = E_{n+1} - E_n = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}(2n+1)$, is much smaller than the thermal energy scale $k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$ for the vast majority of states that contribute to the sum. This justifies the primary approximation required for an analytic solution: the discrete sum over the quantum number $n$ can be accurately replaced by an integral over a continuous variable $n$.\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left[ -\\frac{\\beta h^2 n^2}{8mL^2} \\right] \\approx \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left[ -\\frac{\\beta h^2 n^2}{8mL^2} \\right] dn\n$$\nWe change the lower limit of the integral from $1$ to $0$. This is a valid approximation because for macroscopic $L$, the argument of the exponent is very small for small $n$, making the value of the exponential close to $1$. The error introduced by extending the integration range from $[1, \\infty)$ to $[0, \\infty)$ is negligible compared to the total value of the integral, which is dominated by contributions from very large $n$.\n\nThe integral is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2) dx = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}$. In our case, the variable is $n$ and the constant $a$ is:\n$$\na = \\frac{\\beta h^2}{8mL^2}\n$$\nEvaluating the integral yields:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-an^2) dn = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\frac{\\beta h^2}{8mL^2}}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{8\\pi mL^2}{\\beta h^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi mL^2}{\\beta h^2}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expression for $q_{\\mathrm{trans}}$:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{trans}} = \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi mL^2}{\\beta h^2}} \\right)^3 = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi mL^2}{\\beta h^2} \\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nFinally, we must express the answer in terms of the specified variables. We substitute $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}$ and use the fact that the volume of the cubic box is $V = L^3$, which implies $L^2 = V^{2/3}$.\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{trans}} = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi m V^{2/3} k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h^2} \\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nApplying the exponent $3/2$ to each term in the parenthesis gives the final expression:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{trans}} = \\frac{(2\\pi m k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)^{3/2} (V^{2/3})^{3/2}}{(h^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{(2\\pi m k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)^{3/2} V}{h^3}\n$$\nThis expression is the translational single-particle partition function in the classical, high-temperature limit.

The full partition function for rotation and nuclear spin in the high-temperature limit is:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{rot-nuc}} = q_{\\mathrm{nuc}} \\frac{q'_{\\mathrm{rot}}}{\\sigma} $$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the rotational symmetry number and $q_{\\mathrm{nuc}}$ is the nuclear spin partition function.\n-   The symmetry number $\\sigma$ is $2$ for homonuclear diatomic molecules ($\\mathrm{H_2}$, $\\mathrm{D_2}$) and $1$ for heteronuclear diatomic molecules ($\\mathrm{HD}$).\n-   The nuclear spin $s$ is $1/2$ for a proton ($\\mathrm{H}$) and $1$ for a deuteron ($\\mathrm{D}$).\n-   The nuclear spin partition function for a molecule is the product of the spin degeneracies ($2s+1$) of its constituent nuclei.\n\nWe determine the corrected partition functions for each species:\n-   **For $\\mathrm{H_2}$ (homonuclear):**\n    -   Symmetry number: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 2$.\n    -   Nuclear spin partition function: $q_{\\mathrm{nuc,H_2}} = (2s_{\\mathrm{H}}+1)(2s_{\\mathrm{H}}+1) = (2(1/2)+1)^2 = 2^2 = 4$.\n    -   Corrected partition function contribution: $q_{\\mathrm{H_2}}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = \\frac{q_{\\mathrm{nuc,H_2}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2}}} q'_{\\mathrm{rot,H_2}} = \\frac{4}{2} q'_{\\mathrm{rot,H_2}} = 2 q'_{\\mathrm{rot,H_2}}$.\n\n-   **For $\\mathrm{D_2}$ (homonuclear):**\n    -   Symmetry number: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{D_2}} = 2$.\n    -   Nuclear spin partition function: $q_{\\mathrm{nuc,D_2}} = (2s_{\\mathrm{D}}+1)(2s_{\\mathrm{D}}+1) = (2(1)+1)^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\n    -   Corrected partition function contribution: $q_{\\mathrm{D_2}}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = \\frac{q_{\\mathrm{nuc,D_2}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{D_2}}} q'_{\\mathrm{rot,D_2}} = \\frac{9}{2} q'_{\\mathrm{rot,D_2}}$.\n\n-   **For $\\mathrm{HD}$ (heteronuclear):**\n    -   Symmetry number: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{HD}} = 1$.\n    -   Nuclear spin partition function: $q_{\\mathrm{nuc,HD}} = (2s_{\\mathrm{H}}+1)(2s_{\\mathrm{D}}+1) = (2(1/2)+1)(2(1)+1) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    -   Corrected partition function contribution: $q_{\\mathrm{HD}}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = \\frac{q_{\\mathrm{nuc,HD}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{HD}}} q'_{\\mathrm{rot,HD}} = \\frac{6}{1} q'_{\\mathrm{rot,HD}} = 6 q'_{\\mathrm{rot,HD}}$.\n\nUsing these corrected partition functions, the new equilibrium constant is:\n$$ K_p^{\\mathrm{corr}} = \\frac{(q_{\\mathrm{HD}}^{\\mathrm{corr}})^2}{q_{\\mathrm{H_2}}^{\\mathrm{corr}} q_{\\mathrm{D_2}}^{\\mathrm{corr}}} = \\frac{(6 q'_{\\mathrm{rot,HD}})^2}{(2 q'_{\\mathrm{rot,H_2}}) (\\frac{9}{2} q'_{\\mathrm{rot,D_2}})} = \\frac{36 (q'_{\\mathrm{rot,HD}})^2}{9 (q'_{\\mathrm{rot,H_2}} q'_{\\mathrm{rot,D_2}})} $$\n$$ K_p^{\\mathrm{corr}} = 4 \\left( \\frac{(q'_{\\mathrm{rot,HD}})^2}{q'_{\\mathrm{rot,H_2}} q'_{\\mathrm{rot,D_2}}} \\right) = 4 K_p^{\\mathrm{baseline}} $$\n\nThe multiplicative factor by which the corrected $K_p(T)$ differs from the baseline is therefore $4$.\n\nLet us dissect this factor into its origins:\n1.  **Contribution from symmetry numbers ($\\sigma$):**\n    The factor from symmetry numbers is $\\frac{(1/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{HD}})^2}{(1/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2}})(1/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{D_2}})} = \\frac{(1/1)^2}{(1/2)(1/2)} = \\frac{1}{1/4} = 4$.\n2.  **Contribution from nuclear spin partition functions ($q_{\\mathrm{nuc}}$):**\n    The factor from nuclear spin statistics is $\\frac{(q_{\\mathrm{nuc,HD}})^2}{q_{\\mathrm{nuc,H_2}} q_{\\mathrm{nuc,D_2}}} = \\frac{6^2}{4 \\times 9} = \\frac{36}{36} = 1$.\n\nThe entire multiplicative factor of $4$ comes from correcting for the rotational symmetry numbers. The nuclear spin statistical weights cancel out for this particular reaction.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. $K_p(T)$ increases by a factor of $4$ because homonuclear rotational symmetry numbers enter $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}$ for $\\mathrm{H_2}$ and $\\mathrm{D_2}$, whereas $\\mathrm{HD}$ has no such symmetry division, while nuclear spin statistical weights cancel between reactants and products.\nThis option states the correct factor of $4$. The reasoning is also precisely correct. The factor arises from the symmetry numbers ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2}}=\\sigma_{\\mathrm{D_2}}=2$, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{HD}}=1$), and the nuclear spin statistical weights indeed cancel. **Correct**.\n\nB. $K_p(T)$ increases by a factor of $16$ because both nuclear spin statistical weights and rotational symmetry numbers favor the products.\nThe factor of $16$ is incorrect. The reasoning is also flawed; the nuclear spin weights do not favor either side of the equilibrium, their effect cancels. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. $K_p(T)$ is unchanged (factor $1$) because symmetry and spin affect reactants and products equally.\nThe factor of $1$ is incorrect. The reasoning is false. The symmetry numbers for reactants ($\\sigma=2$) and products ($\\sigma=1$) are different and do not affect them equally. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $K_p(T)$ decreases by a factor of $2$ because the reactants are homonuclear and have fewer accessible rotational orientations.\nThe factor of a decrease is incorrect; the constant increases. The reasoning is also confused. While homonuclear reactants have their partition functions reduced by the symmetry number, a reduction in the denominator ($q_{\\mathrm{reactants}}$) leads to an *increase* in the equilibrium constant, not a decrease. Also, the magnitude is wrong. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2949581"}]}
