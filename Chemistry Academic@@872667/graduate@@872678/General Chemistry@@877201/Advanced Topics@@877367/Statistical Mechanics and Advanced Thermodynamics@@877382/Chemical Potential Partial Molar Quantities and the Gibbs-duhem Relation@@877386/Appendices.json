It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and all provided data and formulas are consistent with established principles and standard literature for the Peng-Robinson Equation of State (PR EOS). The task is to perform a numerical verification, a standard practice in scientific computing, by comparing two methods for calculating the residual chemical potential of a pure substance. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe objective is to compute the residual chemical potential, $\\mu^{R}(T,P)$, for a pure component at a specified temperature $T$ and pressure $P$ using two distinct but theoretically equivalent methods derived from the PR EOS, and then to quantify their numerical difference.\n\nFirst, we define the residual chemical potential $\\mu^{R}$ as the difference between the chemical potential of a real fluid, $\\mu$, and that of an ideal gas, $\\mu^{\\mathrm{ig}}$, at the same temperature and pressure:\n$$\n\\mu^{R}(T,P) = \\mu(T,P) - \\mu^{\\mathrm{ig}}(T,P)\n$$\nThe pressure dependence of the chemical potential at constant temperature is given by the fundamental thermodynamic relation $(\\partial\\mu/\\partial P)_{T} = \\bar{V}$, where $\\bar{V}$ is the molar volume. For an ideal gas, $\\bar{V}^{\\mathrm{ig}} = RT/P$, so $(\\partial\\mu^{\\mathrm{ig}}/\\partial P)_{T} = RT/P$. Combining these gives the pressure dependence of the residual chemical potential:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu^{R}}{\\partial P}\\right)_{T} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial P}\\right)_{T} - \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu^{\\mathrm{ig}}}{\\partial P}\\right)_{T} = \\bar{V} - \\frac{RT}{P}\n$$\nThe molar volume $\\bar{V}$ is to be determined from the PR EOS.\n\nThe Peng-Robinson equation of state is a cubic equation for the compressibility factor $Z = P\\bar{V}/(RT)$. The parameters of the PR EOS depend on the substance's critical temperature $T_{c}$, critical pressure $P_{c}$, and acentric factor $\\omega$.\nThe energy parameter $a$ and volume parameter $b$ are given by:\n$$\na(T) = 0.45724 \\frac{(RT_c)^2}{P_c} \\alpha(T, \\omega)\n$$\n$$\nb = 0.07780 \\frac{RT_c}{P_c}\n$$\nwhere the temperature-dependent term $\\alpha(T, \\omega)$ is\n$$\n\\alpha(T, \\omega) = \\left[1 + \\kappa(\\omega) \\left(1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{T_c}}\\right)\\right]^2\n$$\nwith\n$$\n\\kappa(\\omega) = 0.37464 + 1.54226\\,\\omega - 0.26992\\,\\omega^2\n$$\nIt is convenient to work with dimensionless parameters $A$ and $B$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{a(T)P}{(RT)^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B = \\frac{b P}{RT}\n$$\nThe PR EOS can be written as a cubic polynomial in $Z$:\n$$\nZ^3 - (1-B)Z^2 + (A - 3B^2 - 2B)Z - (AB - B^2 - B^3) = 0\n$$\nFor the specified conditions, which correspond to a gas or supercritical fluid, we must find the roots of this polynomial and select the largest real root, which corresponds to the vapor phase compressibility factor. This requires a numerical root-finding algorithm.\n\nThe first method for computing $\\mu^{R}$ is by direct integration of its pressure derivative. Integrating from a reference pressure $P_0$ to the target pressure $P$ yields:\n$$\n\\mu^{R}(T,P) - \\mu^{R}(T,P_0) = \\int_{P_0}^{P} \\left(\\bar{V}(T,p) - \\frac{RT}{p}\\right) dp\n$$\nWe choose $P_0$ to be a very low pressure (e.g., $1.0\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$) where the fluid behaves nearly as an ideal gas. In the ideal gas limit, $\\mu^{R} \\to 0$. Thus, we can approximate $\\mu^{R}(T,P_0) \\approx 0$. The error introduced by this approximation is on the order of $P_0(b - a/RT)$, which is negligible for a sufficiently small $P_0$. The integral can be rewritten in terms of the compressibility factor $Z$:\n$$\n\\mu^{R}_{\\mathrm{integral}}(T,P) = \\int_{P_0}^{P} \\left(\\frac{Z(T,p)RT}{p} - \\frac{RT}{p}\\right) dp = \\int_{P_0}^{P} \\frac{RT}{p}(Z(T,p)-1) dp\n$$\nThis definite integral is computed using numerical quadrature. For each pressure point $p$ required by the quadrature algorithm, we must solve the PR EOS cubic equation for $Z(T,p)$.\n\nThe second method uses the analytical expression for the fugacity coefficient, $\\phi$, derived from the PR EOS. The residual chemical potential is directly given by $\\mu^{R} = RT \\ln\\phi$. For a pure component, the expression is:\n$$\n\\ln\\phi = Z - 1 - \\ln(Z-B) - \\frac{A}{2\\sqrt{2}B} \\ln\\left(\\frac{Z + (1+\\sqrt{2})B}{Z + (1-\\sqrt{2})B}\\right)\n$$\nTo use this formula, we first compute $A$ and $B$ at the target state $(T, P)$, then solve the PR EOS for the corresponding vapor-phase root $Z$. These values are then substituted into the expression to calculate $\\ln\\phi$, and subsequently $\\mu^{R}_{\\mathrm{analytical}}(T,P) = RT \\ln\\phi$.\n\nThe final step is to compute the absolute difference $\\Delta(T,P) = |\\mu^{R}_{\\mathrm{integral}}(T,P) - \\mu^{R}_{\\mathrm{analytical}}(T,P)|$ for each of the specified test cases. A small value of $\\Delta$ verifies the correctness of the numerical integration scheme and the implementation of the underlying thermodynamic model.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure is as follows:\n1. For each test case, retrieve the component properties ($T_c, P_c, \\omega$) and state conditions ($T, P$).\n2. Implement a function that, for any given ($T, p$), calculates the parameters $a(T)$ and $b$, then $A$ and $B$, solves the PR cubic for $Z$, and returns the largest real root.\n3. For Method 1, define the integrand function $f(p) = \\frac{RT}{p}(Z(T,p)-1)$. Use a numerical quadrature routine (e.g., `scipy.integrate.quad`) to compute $\\mu^{R}_{\\mathrm{integral}} = \\int_{P_0}^{P} f(p) dp$ with $P_0 = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n4. For Method 2, use the function from step 2 to find $Z, A, B$ at the final state $(T, P)$. Substitute these into the analytical formula for $\\ln\\phi$ to compute $\\mu^{R}_{\\mathrm{analytical}}$.\n5. Calculate the absolute difference $\\Delta$ and report it. This process is repeated for all test cases.", "answer": "[3.784860e-09,8.448041e-08,1.401314e-07,1.066463e-07,1.134062e-06]", "id": "2927949"}]}
