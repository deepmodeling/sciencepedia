The initial state $|i, 0\\rangle$ represents the molecule in electronic state $|i\\rangle$ and the vacuum electromagnetic field. The final state $|f, 1_{\\vec{k},\\lambda}\\rangle$ represents the molecule in state $|f\\rangle$ and one photon with wavevector $\\vec{k}$ and polarization $\\lambda$. The delta function ensures energy conservation, with $\\hbar\\omega = E_i - E_f$.\n\nThe minimal-coupling interaction Hamiltonian for a system of particles with charges $q_j$ and momenta $\\vec{p}_j$ interacting with a vector potential $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}_j, t)$ is, in the Coulomb gauge and neglecting the $\\vec{A}^2$ term for one-photon processes:\n$$\nH' = -\\sum_j \\frac{q_j}{m_j} \\vec{p}_j \\cdot \\vec{A}(\\vec{r}_j)\n$$\nThe quantized vector potential for a single mode $(\\vec{k}, \\lambda)$ in a quantization volume $V$ is proportional to:\n$$\n\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}) \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{\\omega V}} \\left( a_{\\vec{k},\\lambda} e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}} + a_{\\vec{k},\\lambda}^{\\dagger} e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}} \\right) \\vec{\\epsilon}_{\\vec{k},\\lambda}\n$$\nwhere $a^{\\dagger}$ is the photon creation operator and $\\vec{\\epsilon}_{\\vec{k},\\lambda}$ is the polarization vector. For spontaneous emission, we consider the $a^{\\dagger}$ term. The matrix element for the creation of a single photon is:\n$$\n\\langle f, 1_{\\vec{k},\\lambda} | H' | i, 0 \\rangle \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\omega}} \\left\\langle f \\left| \\sum_j \\frac{q_j}{m_j} (\\vec{p}_j \\cdot \\vec{\\epsilon}_{\\vec{k},\\lambda}) e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}_j} \\right| i \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe sum over final photon states $\\sum_{\\vec{k}, \\lambda}$ is replaced by an integral over phase space, which introduces the density of states. The density of photon states per unit energy interval scales as $\\rho(E) \\propto \\omega^2/c^3$. Therefore, the transition rate has the general scaling:\n$$\nW \\propto \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^3} \\left| \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\omega}} \\left\\langle f \\left| \\sum_j \\dots \\right| i \\right\\rangle \\right|^2 \\propto \\frac{\\omega}{c^3} \\left| \\left\\langle f \\left| \\sum_j \\frac{q_j}{m_j} (\\vec{p}_j \\cdot \\vec{\\epsilon}_{\\vec{k},\\lambda}) e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}_j} \\right| i \\right\\rangle \\right|^2\n$$\nIn the long-wavelength regime, $ka \\ll 1$, where $k = \\omega/c$ and $a$ is the molecular size, we expand the exponential: $e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}_j} \\approx 1 - i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}_j + \\dots$.\n\n**Electric Dipole (E1) Transition Rate, $W_{E1}$**\n\nThe leading term in the expansion is $1$. The spatial part of the matrix element is:\n$$\nM_{E1, \\text{spatial}} = \\left\\langle f \\left| \\sum_j \\frac{q_j}{m_j} \\vec{p}_j \\right| i \\right\\rangle \\cdot \\vec{\\epsilon}_{\\vec{k},\\lambda}\n$$\nUsing the commutation relation $[\\vec{r}_j, H_0] = i\\hbar\\vec{p}_j/m_j$, where $H_0$ is the unperturbed molecular Hamiltonian, we can express the momentum matrix element in terms of the position matrix element:\n$$\n\\langle f|\\vec{p}_j|i\\rangle = \\frac{m_j}{i\\hbar}\\langle f|[\\vec{r}_j, H_0]|i\\rangle = \\frac{m_j(E_f-E_i)}{i\\hbar}\\langle f|\\vec{r}_j|i\\rangle = i m_j \\omega \\langle f|\\vec{r}_j|i\\rangle\n$$\n(Note we have used $\\hbar \\omega = E_i - E_f$). Substituting this into the expression for $M_{E1, \\text{spatial}}$ gives:\n$$\nM_{E1, \\text{spatial}} \\propto \\omega \\left\\langle f \\left| \\sum_j q_j \\vec{r}_j \\right| i \\right\\rangle \\propto \\omega \\langle f | \\vec{d} | i \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{d} = \\sum_j q_j \\vec{r}_j$ is the electric dipole operator (a tensor of rank $1$). The problem states that the transition matrix element scales with the molecular size according to its tensorial order. Thus, the magnitude of the dipole matrix element scales as $|\\langle f|\\vec{d}|i\\rangle| \\propto a$.\n\nCombining all factors, the squared matrix element scales as:\n$$\n|M_{E1, \\text{spatial}}|^2 \\propto \\omega^2 |\\langle f|\\vec{d}|i\\rangle|^2 \\propto \\omega^2 a^2\n$$\nThe total transition rate $W_{E1}$ scaling is then:\n$$\nW_{E1} \\propto \\frac{\\omega}{c^3} |M_{E1, \\text{spatial}}|^2 \\propto \\frac{\\omega}{c^3} (\\omega^2 a^2) = \\frac{\\omega^3 a^2}{c^3}\n$$\n\n**Electric Quadrupole (E2) Transition Rate, $W_{E2}$**\n\nThe next term in the multipole expansion is $-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}_j$. The spatial part of the corresponding matrix element is:\n$$\nM_{E2+M1, \\text{spatial}} \\propto \\left\\langle f \\left| \\sum_j \\frac{q_j}{m_j} (\\vec{p}_j \\cdot \\vec{\\epsilon}_{\\vec{k},\\lambda}) (-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}_j) \\right| i \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThis term contains contributions from both the electric quadrupole (E2) and magnetic dipole (M1) moments. The E2 part arises from the symmetric part of the operator $(\\vec{p}_j \\cdot \\vec{\\epsilon})(\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{r}_j)$. A similar analysis as for the E1 case relates this to the matrix element of the operator $\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_j q_j [(\\vec{r}_j \\cdot \\vec{\\epsilon})(\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{r}_j) + (\\vec{r}_j \\cdot \\vec{k})(\\vec{\\epsilon} \\cdot \\vec{r}_j)]$, which is related to the time derivative of $\\sum_j q_j (\\vec{r}_j \\cdot \\vec{\\epsilon}) (\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}_j)$. This introduces a factor of $\\omega$.\nThe spatial matrix element for the E2 transition thus scales as:\n$$\nM_{E2, \\text{spatial}} \\propto \\omega \\left\\langle f \\left| \\sum_j q_j (\\vec{r}_j \\cdot \\vec{\\epsilon}_{\\vec{k},\\lambda})(\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}_j) \\right| i \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe operator inside the matrix element is a contraction of the electric quadrupole tensor $Q'_{ab} = \\sum_j q_j r_{ja} r_{jb}$ (a tensor of rank $2$) with components of $\\vec{k}$ and $\\vec{\\epsilon}$.\nThus, $M_{E2, \\text{spatial}} \\propto \\omega k |\\langle f|Q'|i\\rangle|$.\nAccording to the problem's assumption, the matrix element of the rank-$2$ tensor $Q'$ scales as $|\\langle f|Q'|i\\rangle| \\propto a^2$. Substituting $k = \\omega/c$, we get:\n$$\n|M_{E2, \\text{spatial}}| \\propto \\omega k a^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2 a^2}{c}\n$$\nThe squared matrix element is:\n$$\n|M_{E2, \\text{spatial}}|^2 \\propto \\frac{\\omega^4 a^4}{c^2}\n$$\nThe total transition rate $W_{E2}$ scaling is therefore:\n$$\nW_{E2} \\propto \\frac{\\omega}{c^3} |M_{E2, \\text{spatial}}|^2 \\propto \\frac{\\omega}{c^3} \\left(\\frac{\\omega^4 a^4}{c^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\omega^5 a^4}{c^5}\n$$\n\n**Ratio of Rates, $R(\\omega, a)$**\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R(\\omega,a) = W_{E2}/W_{E1}$. All numerical prefactors and angular factors are neglected as per the instructions, so we use the derived scaling relations.\n$$\nR(\\omega, a) = \\frac{W_{E2}}{W_{E1}} = \\frac{C_2 (\\omega^5 a^4 / c^5)}{C_1 (\\omega^3 a^2 / c^3)}\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of order unity that we are instructed to ignore.\n$$\nR(\\omega, a) = \\frac{\\omega^5 a^4 c^3}{\\omega^3 a^2 c^5} = \\frac{\\omega^2 a^2}{c^2}\n$$\nThis expression can also be written in terms of the wave number $k=\\omega/c$ as $(ka)^2$. Given the condition $ka \\ll 1$, this shows that the E2 transition rate is significantly smaller than the E1 rate, as expected.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\omega^2 a^2}{c^2}}\n$$", "id": "2888184"}]}
