A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe Hückel secular equation to be solved is the eigenvalue problem $\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{c} = E\\mathbf{c}$, since the overlap matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ is the identity matrix $\\mathbf{I}$.

For a cycle of length $N$, the allowed values of $k$ are integers, typically chosen as $k=0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\dots$. For $N=6$, a complete, unique set of states is obtained for $k \\in \\{0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, 3\\}$. The normalization constant $A$ is determined by the condition $\\sum_{j=1}^{N} |c_{j}^{(k)}|^2 = 1$, which yields $A = 1/\\sqrt{N}$.

Specifically, matrix elements between the sets $\\{f_1, f_2\\}$ and $\\{f_3, f_4\\}$ are zero. For example:\n$H_{f_1, f_3} = \\langle \\phi_1+\\phi_3 | \\hat{H} | \\phi_1-\\phi_3 \\rangle = H_{11} - H_{13} + H_{31} - H_{33} = \\alpha - 0 + 0 - \\alpha = 0$.\nThe full matrix in this new basis becomes block-diagonal.\n\nWe now compute the matrix elements for the two $2 \\times 2$ blocks. The overlap matrix elements in this basis are $S_{f_i, f_j} = \\langle f_i | f_j \\rangle = 2\\delta_{ij}$, thus the overlap matrix is $2I$.\n\nFor the first block (basis $\\{f_1, f_2\\}$):\n$$ H'_{11} = \\langle f_1 | \\hat{H} | f_1 \\rangle = H_{11} + 2H_{13} + H_{33} = 2\\alpha $$\n$$ H'_{22} = \\langle f_2 | \\hat{H} | f_2 \\rangle = H_{22} + 2H_{24} + H_{44} = 2\\alpha $$\n$$ H'_{12} = \\langle f_1 | \\hat{H} | f_2 \\rangle = H_{12} + H_{14} + H_{32} + H_{34} = \\beta(1+\\delta) + \\beta(1-\\delta) + \\beta(1-\\delta) + \\beta(1+\\delta) = 4\\beta $$\nThe secular equation for this block is $\\det(H'_{1,2} - E S'_{1,2})=0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\alpha - 2E  4\\beta \\\\ 4\\beta  2\\alpha - 2E \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies 4(\\alpha - E)^2 - 16\\beta^2 = 0 \\implies \\alpha - E = \\pm 2\\beta\n$$\nThis gives two orbital energies: $E = \\alpha - 2\\beta$ and $E = \\alpha + 2\\beta$.\n\nFor the second block (basis $\\{f_3, f_4\\}$):\n$$ H'_{33} = \\langle f_3 | \\hat{H} | f_3 \\rangle = H_{11} - 2H_{13} + H_{33} = 2\\alpha $$\n$$ H'_{44} = \\langle f_4 | \\hat{H} | f_4 \\rangle = H_{22} - 2H_{24} + H_{44} = 2\\alpha $$\n$$ H'_{34} = \\langle f_3 | \\hat{H} | f_4 \\rangle = H_{12} - H_{14} - H_{32} + H_{34} = \\beta(1+\\delta) - \\beta(1-\\delta) - \\beta(1-\\delta) + \\beta(1+\\delta) = 4\\beta\\delta $$\nThe secular equation for this block is $\\det(H'_{3,4} - E S'_{3,4})=0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\alpha - 2E  4\\beta\\delta \\\\ 4\\beta\\delta  2\\alpha - 2E \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies 4(\\alpha - E)^2 - 16(\\beta\\delta)^2 = 0 \\implies \\alpha - E = \\pm 2\\beta\\delta\n$$\nThis gives the other two orbital energies: $E = \\alpha - 2\\beta\\delta$ and $E = \\alpha + 2\\beta\\delta$.\n\nThe spectrum of the operator is the set of four eigenvalues: $\\{\\alpha+2\\beta, \\alpha-2\\beta, \\alpha+2\\beta\\delta, \\alpha-2\\beta\\delta\\}$.\n\nNow, we analyze these energies to determine the total $\\pi$-electron energy for $4$ electrons. We must order the levels according to energy. Given $\\beta  0$ and $|\\delta|  1$.\nIn the high-symmetry case where $\\delta=0$ (square cyclobutadiene), the energies are $\\alpha+2\\beta$, $\\alpha-2\\beta$, and a doubly degenerate level at $\\alpha$. The ground state electron configuration has two electrons in the lowest level ($\\alpha+2\\beta$) and two electrons to place in the two degenerate highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs). This situation, a degenerate partially-filled level, is unstable with respect to a geometric distortion that lifts the degeneracy. This is the Jahn-Teller effect.\n\nFor $\\delta \\neq 0$, the degeneracy is lifted. The levels at $\\alpha$ split into $\\alpha+2\\beta\\delta$ and $\\alpha-2\\beta\\delta$. To find the total energy, we must occupy the two lowest-energy orbitals with two electrons each.\nThe lowest energy level is unambiguously $E_I = \\alpha+2\\beta$ (since $\\beta$ is negative).\nThe second lowest level, $E_{II}$, depends on the sign of $\\delta$:\n- If $\\delta  0$, then $2\\beta\\delta$ is negative and $-2\\beta\\delta$ is positive. The ordered pair from the split levels is $\\alpha+2\\beta\\delta  \\alpha-2\\beta\\delta$. Thus, $E_{II} = \\alpha+2\\beta\\delta$.\n- If $\\delta  0$, then $2\\beta\\delta$ is positive and $-2\\beta\\delta$ is negative. The ordered pair is $\\alpha-2\\beta\\delta  \\alpha+2\\beta\\delta$. Thus, $E_{II} = \\alpha-2\\beta\\delta$.\n\nThe total $\\pi$-electron energy, $E_{\\pi}$, is the sum of the energies of the occupied orbitals: $E_{\\pi} = 2E_I + 2E_{II}$.\n- For $\\delta  0$: $E_{\\pi} = 2(\\alpha+2\\beta) + 2(\\alpha+2\\beta\\delta) = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta + 4\\beta\\delta$.\n- For $\\delta  0$: $E_{\\pi} = 2(\\alpha+2\\beta) + 2(\\alpha-2\\beta\\delta) = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta - 4\\beta\\delta$.\n\nThese two cases can be combined into a single expression using the absolute value function, $|\\delta|$:\nFor $\\delta  0$, $|\\delta|=\\delta$. For $\\delta  0$, $|\\delta|=-\\delta$. So in both scenarios, the stabilization term is positive, while $\\beta$ is negative. Let's rewrite the expressions in terms of $|\\delta|$.\n- For $\\delta  0$, $E_{\\pi} = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta + 4\\beta|\\delta|$.\n- For $\\delta  0$, $E_{\\pi} = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta + 4\\beta(-\\delta) = 4\\alpha+4\\beta+4\\beta|\\delta|$.\nThus, a single expression valid for any $\\delta$ is:\n$$ E_{\\pi} = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta + 4\\beta|\\delta| $$\nThis can be simplified by factoring:\n$$ E_{\\pi} = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta(1+|\\delta|) $$\nThe energy of the undistorted molecule ($\\delta=0$) is $E_{\\pi}(0) = 4\\alpha+4\\beta$. The change in energy upon distortion is $\\Delta E_{\\pi} = E_{\\pi}(\\delta) - E_{\\pi}(0) = 4\\beta|\\delta|$. Since $\\beta0$ and $|\\delta|\\ge 0$, the distortion always leads to a stabilization ($\\Delta E_{\\pi} \\le 0$), as predicted by the Jahn-Teller theorem.\nThe effective resonance integrals are modified by the distortion. When $\\delta0$, the shorter bonds have a more negative resonance integral $\\beta(1+\\delta)$, while the longer bonds have a less negative one, $\\beta(1-\\delta)$. This breaks the symmetry and stabilizes the system. The final expression encapsulates this stabilization.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4\\alpha + 4\\beta(1 + |\\delta|)}\n$$", "id": "2896654"}]}
