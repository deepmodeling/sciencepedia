The hydrogen atom is a fundamental system in quantum mechanics. The Hartree-Fock method, Coupled Cluster theory, and the concept of electron correlation are central pillars of modern computational chemistry. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information (system, methods, basis set limit, definitions) to arrive at a unique, logical conclusion. The language is objective and precise. The idealization of a \"complete one-electron basis\" is a standard theoretical construct used to separate method error from basis set error. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not ambiguous, and is directly relevant to the specified scientific field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is declared **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe problem concerns the application of the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) methods to a one-electron system, specifically the hydrogen atom ($Z=1$).\n\n$1$. **The Hamiltonian and the Exact Solution:**\nWithin the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the nucleus is stationary. The non-relativistic electronic Hamiltonian for a one-electron system with nuclear charge $Z$ is purely a one-electron operator:\n$$ \\hat{H} = \\hat{h}(1) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_1^2 - \\frac{Z}{r_1} $$\nFor the hydrogen atom, $Z=1$. This Hamiltonian does not contain any two-electron terms ($1/r_{ij}$), as there is only one electron. The Schrödinger equation, $\\hat{H}\\Psi = E\\Psi$, is exactly solvable for this system. The energy obtained, $E_{\\mathrm{exact}}$, is the exact non-relativistic electronic energy.\n\n$2$. **The Hartree-Fock (HF) Method for a One-Electron System:**\nThe HF method approximates the many-electron wavefunction as a single Slater determinant. For a one-electron system, this determinant is simply the one-electron orbital itself, $|\\Phi_0\\rangle = |\\psi_1\\rangle$. The HF energy is found by minimizing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, $E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = \\langle\\Phi_0|\\hat{H}|\\Phi_0\\rangle$. The minimization process leads to the canonical HF equations, $\\hat{f}|\\psi_i\\rangle = \\epsilon_i|\\psi_i\\rangle$, where $\\hat{f}$ is the Fock operator.\n\nThe general form of the Fock operator for electron $1$ is:\n$$ \\hat{f}(1) = \\hat{h}(1) + \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\left( \\hat{J}_j(1) - \\hat{K}_j(1) \\right) $$\nwhere $\\hat{J}_j$ is the Coulomb operator and $\\hat{K}_j$ is the exchange operator, which both describe interactions with other electrons. For a one-electron system ($N=1$), the sum describes the interaction of the electron with itself. This self-interaction is known to be exactly canceled, i.e., $\\hat{J}_1(1) - \\hat{K}_1(1) = 0$. Consequently, the Fock operator simplifies to the core Hamiltonian:\n$$ \\hat{f}(1) = \\hat{h}(1) $$\nTherefore, the HF equation for the single electron becomes $\\hat{h}(1)|\\psi_1\\rangle = \\epsilon_1|\\psi_1\\rangle$. This is identical to the exact Schrödinger equation for the system.\n\nGiven that a \"complete one-electron basis\" is used, the HF calculation is able to find the exact orbital $|\\psi_1\\rangle$ and thus the exact energy. This means that for any one-electron system, the HF method is not an approximation but is exact.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = E_{\\mathrm{exact}} $$\n\n$3$. **Electronic Correlation Energy:**\nThe problem defines correlation energy as $E_{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{\\mathrm{exact}} - E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$. Based on our finding that $E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = E_{\\mathrm{exact}}$, the exact correlation energy for a one-electron system is identically zero.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{\\mathrm{exact}} - E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = 0 $$\nElectron correlation is fundamentally a many-electron phenomenon, arising from the inadequacy of the mean-field (HF) approximation to describe the instantaneous interactions between electrons. With only one electron, such interactions do not exist, and thus there is no correlation.\n\n$4$. **The Coupled Cluster (CCSD) Method for a One-Electron System:**\nThe CCSD wavefunction is constructed as $|\\Psi_{\\text{CCSD}}\\rangle = e^{\\hat{T}}|\\Phi_0\\rangle$, where $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ is the HF reference and the cluster operator $\\hat{T}$ is truncated at single and double excitations: $\\hat{T} = \\hat{T}_1 + \\hat{T}_2$.\n- The singles operator, $\\hat{T}_1 = \\sum_{i,a} t_i^a \\hat{a}_a^\\dagger \\hat{a}_i$, excites one electron from an occupied orbital $i$ to a virtual orbital $a$.\n- The doubles operator, $\\hat{T}_2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{i,j,a,b} t_{ij}^{ab} \\hat{a}_a^\\dagger \\hat{a}_b^\\dagger \\hat{a}_j \\hat{a}_i$, excites two electrons from occupied orbitals $i,j$ to virtual orbitals $a,b$.\n\nFor a one-electron system, the occupied space contains only one orbital. It is therefore impossible to select two occupied orbitals for a double excitation. The operator $\\hat{T}_2$ cannot produce a non-zero result when acting on a one-electron determinant. Consequently, all double excitation amplitudes must be zero: $t_{ij}^{ab} = 0$.\n\nThe CCSD equations for the amplitudes are derived from projecting the CC Schrödinger equation onto the space of excited determinants. These equations are driven by the two-electron part of the Hamiltonian. Since the Hamiltonian for a one-electron system has no two-electron terms, all two-electron integrals are zero.\nThe double-excitation amplitude equations have the general form:\n$$ (\\epsilon_a + \\epsilon_b - \\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j) t_{ij}^{ab} = \\langle ij || ab \\rangle + \\dots $$\nwhere $\\langle ij || ab \\rangle$ is an antisymmetrized two-electron integral. Since all such integrals are zero, and the remaining terms also depend on two-electron interactions, the only solution is $t_{ij}^{ab}=0$.\nWith $t_{ij}^{ab}=0$, the single-excitation amplitude equations simplify to:\n$$ (\\epsilon_a - \\epsilon_i) t_i^a = \\dots $$\nThe terms on the right-hand side also vanish because they involve two-electron integrals that couple singles and doubles amplitudes. This leaves $(\\epsilon_a - \\epsilon_i) t_i^a = 0$. Since for an excitation $\\epsilon_a > \\epsilon_i$, the energy difference is non-zero, requiring that the singles amplitudes must also be zero: $t_i^a=0$.\n\nTherefore, for a one-electron system, all cluster amplitudes vanish, $\\hat{T} = \\hat{T}_1 + \\hat{T}_2 = 0$. The CCSD wavefunction becomes identical to the HF reference:\n$$ |\\Psi_{\\text{CCSD}}\\rangle = e^0 |\\Phi_0\\rangle = |\\Phi_0\\rangle = |\\Psi_{\\text{HF}}\\rangle $$\nThe CCSD energy is thus equal to the HF energy:\n$$ E_{\\text{CCSD}} = E_{\\text{HF}} $$\nThe correlation energy predicted by CCSD is $E_{\\text{CCSD}} - E_{\\text{HF}}$. For this system, the value is $0$.\nSo, CCSD correctly finds that the correlation energy is zero for a one-electron system.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}=0$ because there is no electron–electron interaction in a $1$-electron system, so HF is exact and the CCSD cluster amplitudes vanish.**\nThis statement claims that the correlation energy is $0$. This is **Correct**. It provides a three-part reason:\n$1$. \"there is no electron–electron interaction in a $1$-electron system\": This is the fundamental physical reality. **Correct**.\n$2$. \"so HF is exact\": As derived above, the absence of electron-electron interaction makes the HF equation identical to the Schrödinger equation, rendering the HF solution exact (in a complete basis). **Correct**.\n$3$. \"and the CCSD cluster amplitudes vanish\": As derived above, the absence of two-electron interactions, which drive the excitations, forces all singles and doubles amplitudes to be zero. **Correct**.\nThe entire statement is a complete and accurate description of the situation.\n\n**B. $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}<0$ because CCSD captures dynamical correlation via double excitations that lower the energy even with $1$ electron.**\nThis statement claims $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}<0$. This is **Incorrect**. The correlation energy is exactly $0$. The reasoning is also flawed: \"double excitations ... even with $1$ electron\" is a physical impossibility. One cannot excite two electrons when only one is present.\n\n**C. $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}=0$ because basis set incompleteness cancels the correlation energy error in CCSD for $1$ electron.**\nThis statement claims $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}=0$, which is the correct value. However, the reasoning is entirely flawed. First, the problem explicitly posits a \"complete one-electron basis,\" so \"basis set incompleteness\" is not a factor. Second, there is no \"correlation energy error in CCSD\" for this system; CCSD is exact here. Third, the idea of a fortuitous cancellation between two unrelated error types is not a valid fundamental principle. This reasoning is nonsensical. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}>0$ because truncation in CCSD leads to an overestimation of correlation that raises the energy above HF for $1$ electron.**\nThis statement claims $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}>0$. By definition, for the exact ground state, $E_{\\mathrm{exact}} \\le E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$ (due to the variational principle for HF), which implies $E_{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{\\mathrm{exact}} - E_{\\mathrm{HF}} \\le 0$. A positive correlation energy is a physical impossibility. Furthermore, the reasoning is incorrect. CCSD is not truncated for a one-electron system; it is exact. Therefore, the statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A provides the correct value for the correlation energy and a completely sound and fundamental explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2453766"}, {"introduction": "Having established that electron correlation is a multi-electron phenomenon, we now dissect the structure of the CC equations to see how they capture it.

It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of Coupled Cluster methods in quantum chemistry, it is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous derivation. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part derivation within the Coupled Cluster Singles (CCS) framework, starting from a canonical Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) reference determinant $|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle$.\n\nThe fundamental equations for any Coupled Cluster method are derived by projecting the Schrödinger equation, $\\hat{H}|\\Psi\\rangle = E|\\Psi\\rangle$, onto the reference state and the manifold of excited states. Using the CC ansatz $|\\Psi\\rangle = \\exp(\\hat{T})|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle$ and the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\\bar{H} = \\exp(-\\hat{T})\\hat{H}\\exp(\\hat{T})$, the Schrödinger equation can be rewritten as $\\bar{H}|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle = (E - E_{\\text{ref}}) \\exp(\\hat{T})|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle$. Projecting this equation provides the necessary expressions for the energy and the cluster amplitudes.\n\n1) The CCS energy expression.\n\nThe total energy $E_{\\text{CCS}}$ is obtained by projecting the CC Schrödinger equation onto the reference determinant $|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\hat{H} \\exp(\\hat{T}) | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle = E_{\\text{CCS}} \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\exp(\\hat{T}) | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle $$\nSince the cluster operator $\\hat{T}$ creates excitations from the reference, $\\hat{T}|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ is a linear combination of excited determinants orthogonal to $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$. The expansion of the exponential operator is $\\exp(\\hat{T}) = 1 + \\hat{T} + \\frac{1}{2}\\hat{T}^2 + \\dots$. Therefore, $\\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\exp(\\hat{T}) | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_{0} | (1 + \\hat{T} + \\dots) | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle = 1$.\nThe energy expression becomes $E_{\\text{CCS}} = \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\hat{H} \\exp(\\hat{T}) | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$.\nBy inserting $\\exp(-\\hat{T})\\exp(\\hat{T})=1$ between $\\hat{H}$ and $\\exp(\\hat{T})$, we get:\n$$ E_{\\text{CCS}} = \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\hat{H} \\exp(-\\hat{T})\\exp(\\hat{T}) \\exp(\\hat{T}) | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle \\text{ (this is incorrect)} $$\nThe correct procedure is to use the property that $\\langle \\Phi_0 | \\exp(\\hat{T}) = \\langle \\Phi_0|$.\nWe start from the similarity transformed equation projected on the reference: $\\langle \\Phi_0 | \\bar{H}|\\Phi_0\\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_0 | \\exp(-\\hat{T})\\hat{H}\\exp(\\hat{T})|\\Phi_0\\rangle = (E - E_{ref}) \\langle\\Phi_0|\\exp(\\hat{T})|\\Phi_0\\rangle = E-E_{ref}$.\nThe energy expression is therefore given by the vacuum expectation value of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian. With $\\hat{T} = \\hat{T}_1$ for CCS, this is:\n$$ E_{\\text{CCS}} = \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\bar{H} | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle + E_{\\text{RHF}} $$\nHowever, the common convention defines the correlation energy as $E_{\\text{corr}} = \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\bar{H} | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$. Thus, the total energy is $E_{\\text{CCS}} = E_{\\text{RHF}} + E_{\\text{corr}}^{\\text{CCS}}$. The expression for the total energy in terms of a projection of $\\bar{H}$ is simply its expectation value with respect to the reference state, adding the reference energy. A more direct form from $E_{\\text{CCS}}=\\langle\\Phi_0|\\hat{H}\\exp(\\hat{T}_1)|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ is also commonly cited, leading to $E_{\\text{corr}}^{\\text{CCS}}=\\langle\\Phi_0|(\\hat{H}-E_{\\text{RHF}})\\exp(\\hat{T}_1)|\\Phi_0\\rangle_C$. However, the most fundamental form is the projection of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian:\n$$ E_{\\text{CCS}} = \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\bar{H} | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle $$\nwhere it is understood that $\\bar{H}$ is defined such that $\\langle \\Phi_0 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = E_{\\text{RHF}}$ is its zeroth-order component.\n\n2) The CCS single-excitation amplitude equations.\n\nThe equations for the cluster amplitudes $t_{i}^{a}$ are found by projecting the CC Schrödinger equation onto the manifold of singly-excited determinants $|\\Phi_{i}^{a}\\rangle = \\hat{a}_{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}_{i}|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle$. Projecting the equation $\\bar{H}|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle = E_{\\text{corr}} \\exp(\\hat{T})|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ onto $\\langle \\Phi_i^a |$ yields a complicated expression. The standard and most direct method is to demand that the projection of $\\bar{H}|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ onto the excitation manifold vanishes. This ensures that the CC wavefunction is the best possible solution within the given excitation space. For CCS, we project onto the space of singles:\n$$ \\langle \\Phi_{i}^{a} | \\bar{H} | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\forall i \\in \\text{occ}, a \\in \\text{virt} $$\nThis provides a set of coupled, non-linear equations for the amplitudes $t_{i}^{a}$ that are contained within $\\bar{H} = \\exp(-\\hat{T}_{1})\\hat{H}\\exp(\\hat{T}_{1})$.\n\n3) The CCS correlation energy for a canonical RHF reference.\n\nThe correlation energy is defined as $E_{\\text{corr}}^{\\text{CCS}} = E_{\\text{CCS}} - E_{\\text{RHF}}$. We must first solve the amplitude equations to find the values of $t_{i}^{a}$ and then substitute them into the energy expression.\n\nLet us analyze the amplitude equation $\\langle \\Phi_{i}^{a} | \\bar{H} | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle = 0$. Using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion for $\\bar{H}$ and the normal-ordered Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_N = \\hat{H} - E_{\\text{RHF}}$ (for which $\\hat{H}_N|\\Phi_0\\rangle = 0$), the amplitude equation becomes:\n$$ \\langle \\Phi_{i}^{a} | (\\hat{H}_N + [\\hat{H}_N, \\hat{T}_{1}] + \\frac{1}{2}[[\\hat{H}_N, \\hat{T}_{1}], \\hat{T}_{1}] + \\dots) | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle = 0 $$\nLet's analyze the terms:\n- The first term is $\\langle \\Phi_{i}^{a} | \\hat{H}_N | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$. For a Hartree-Fock reference, this matrix element is given by Brillouin's theorem: $\\langle \\Phi_{i}^{a} | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle = f_{i}^{a}$. In the basis of canonical molecular orbitals, the Fock matrix is diagonal, and the block connecting occupied ($i$) and virtual ($a$) orbitals is zero. The problem explicitly gives this condition as $f_{a}^{i} = 0$. Assuming standard physicist-style indexing where $f_p^q = \\int \\phi_p^*(x) \\hat{f} \\phi_q(x) dx$, this corresponds to $f_i^a=0$. Thus, this first term is zero.\n- The remaining terms are all functions of the amplitudes $t_{j}^{b}$ from $\\hat{T}_{1}$. For example, the linear term in $t$ comes from $\\langle \\Phi_{i}^{a} | [\\hat{H}_N, \\hat{T}_{1}] | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$.\n\nSince the constant (inhomogeneous) term $\\langle \\Phi_{i}^{a} | \\hat{H}_N | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$ is zero, the CCS amplitude equations become a system of homogeneous non-linear equations in the variables $t_{i}^{a}$:\n$$ 0 = \\sum_{j,b} C_{ij}^{ab} t_{j}^{b} + \\sum_{j,b,k,c} D_{ijk}^{abc} t_{j}^{b}t_{k}^{c} + \\dots $$\nA system of homogeneous equations always admits the trivial solution, which in this case is:\n$$ t_{i}^{a} = 0 \\quad \\forall i,a $$\nWhile non-linear equations can have multiple solutions, this trivial solution is the one continuously connected to the non-interacting limit and is the physically correct one for a stable Hartree-Fock reference.\n\nNow, we evaluate the correlation energy $E_{\\text{corr}}^{\\text{CCS}}$. Using the linked-cluster theorem, the energy can be written in terms of the amplitudes.\n$$ E_{\\text{corr}}^{\\text{CCS}} = \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\hat{H}_N \\exp(\\hat{T}_1) | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle_{C} = \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\hat{H}_N (1 + \\hat{T}_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\hat{T}_1^2 + \\dots) | \\Phi_0 \\rangle_C $$\n- $\\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\hat{H}_N | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle_{C} = 0$ by definition.\n- $\\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\hat{H}_N \\hat{T}_{1} | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle_{C} = \\sum_{i,a} t_{i}^{a} \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\hat{H}_N | \\Phi_{i}^{a} \\rangle = \\sum_{i,a} t_{i}^{a} f_{i}^{a} = 0$ due to the canonical RHF condition.\n- The first non-zero contribution would arise from terms quadratic in the amplitudes, such as $\\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\hat{W}_N \\hat{T}_1^2 | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle_{C}$, where $\\hat{W}_N$ is the normal-ordered fluctuation potential. An explicit expression is:\n$$ E_{\\text{corr}}^{\\text{CCS}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{ijab} (t_{i}^{a}t_{j}^{b} - t_{i}^{b}t_{j}^{a})\\langle ij || ab \\rangle $$\nwhere $\\langle ij || ab \\rangle$ are the antisymmetrized two-electron integrals.\nSince the solution to the amplitude equations is $t_{i}^{a}=0$ for all $i$ and $a$, we substitute this result into the energy expression. Every term in the summation for $E_{\\text{corr}}^{\\text{CCS}}$ contains products of amplitudes, and thus every term is zero.\n\nTherefore, the CCS correlation energy is exactly zero.\n$$ E_{\\text{corr}}^{\\text{CCS}} = 0 $$\nThis result demonstrates a fundamental property of the CCS method: for a canonical Hartree-Fock reference, it does not recover any correlation energy. The singles-only model cannot describe electron correlation starting from a reference for which single excitations are decoupled from the ground state via the Hamiltonian, a condition guaranteed by Brillouin's theorem. Correlation effects are primarily due to two-electron interactions, which require at least doubly-excited configurations, handled by $\\hat{T}_2$ in higher-level CC theories like CCSD.\nThe final answer is $0$ hartree.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2453785"}, {"introduction": "The accuracy of a quantum chemistry method is always balanced against its computational cost.

Assuming additions scale similarly, the cost of computing one element $R_{ij}^{ab}$ is proportional to the number of terms in the sum.\n$$\n\\text{Cost per } R_{ij}^{ab} \\text{ element} \\propto n_v^2\n$$\nThe total computational cost is the product of the number of residual elements to be calculated and the cost to compute each element.\n$$\n\\text{Total Cost} \\propto (\\text{Number of elements of } R_{ij}^{ab}) \\times (\\text{Cost per element})\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\n\\text{Total Cost} \\propto (n_o^2 n_v^2) \\times (n_v^2) = n_o^2 n_v^4\n$$\nA direct loop-based implementation would look as follows:\n```\nFor i = 1 to n_o\n  For j = 1 to n_o\n    For a = 1 to n_v\n      For b = 1 to n_v\n        accumulator = 0\n        For c = 1 to n_v\n          For d = 1 to n_v\n            // One multiplication and one addition\n            accumulator += get_integral(a,b,c,d) * get_tau(i,j,c,d)\n        R(i,j,a,b) += accumulator\n```\nThe innermost operation is executed for each combination of the six indices. The total number of iterations, and thus the dominant computational scaling, is the product of the loop ranges: $n_o \\times n_o \\times n_v \\times n_v \\times n_v \\times n_v = n_o^2 n_v^4$.\n\nThe problem asks for the leading-order cost as a single monomial, ignoring constant prefactors. Therefore, the computational cost scales as $n_o^2 n_v^4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{n_o^{2} n_v^{4}}\n$$", "id": "2453758"}]}
