## Introduction
Understanding the behavior of electronic excited states is fundamental to numerous areas of chemistry and physics, from [photochemistry](@entry_id:140933) and materials science to high-energy spectroscopy. While experiments provide a wealth of data, their interpretation hinges on robust theoretical models that can accurately predict [excitation energies](@entry_id:190368) and transition properties. The Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction (ADC) for the [polarization propagator](@entry_id:201288) emerges as a powerful and elegant solution to this challenge. It offers a family of methods derived directly from the principles of many-body Green's [function theory](@entry_id:195067), providing a systematic, reliable, and computationally feasible route to studying the [electronic spectra](@entry_id:154403) of molecular systems.

The core problem ADC addresses is how to translate the complex, diagrammatic language of [many-body perturbation theory](@entry_id:168555) into a practical computational algorithm that is both accurate and numerically stable. Unlike methods that can suffer from unphysical solutions or an inability to describe important electronic correlation effects, the ADC framework is constructed to avoid these pitfalls. This article provides a graduate-level exploration of this powerful theoretical tool.

The sections are structured to build a comprehensive understanding from first principles to advanced applications. In "Principles and Mechanisms," we will dissect the theoretical machinery of ADC, starting with the [polarization propagator](@entry_id:201288) and its connection to spectroscopy, moving through the Dyson equation, and culminating in the construction of the ADC matrix via the Intermediate State Representation. Next, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate the method's versatility by exploring its use in predicting various spectroscopic phenomena, tackling challenging electronic structures, and situating it within the broader landscape of many-body theories like TDDFT and the Bethe-Salpeter Equation. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section will provide challenging conceptual problems to solidify your grasp of the core concepts and their practical implications.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This section delves into the theoretical foundations and operational mechanisms of the Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction (ADC) scheme for the [polarization propagator](@entry_id:201288). We will begin by defining the central quantum mechanical object, the [polarization propagator](@entry_id:201288), in its various forms and establish its connection to observable spectroscopic properties. Subsequently, we will introduce the pivotal Dyson-like equation that recasts the [many-body problem](@entry_id:138087) in terms of an irreducible kernel. This provides the theoretical entry point for the ADC method, which we will define as a systematic, order-by-order [approximation scheme](@entry_id:267451). The core of our discussion will then focus on the practical machinery of ADC, namely the Intermediate State Representation (ISR), which translates the [diagrammatic perturbation theory](@entry_id:137034) into a computationally tractable Hermitian [eigenvalue problem](@entry_id:143898). We will construct the explicit ADC matrices for the first and second orders of the hierarchy, relating them to other well-known quantum chemical methods. Finally, we will analyze the formal properties of the ADC scheme, such as stability and [size-consistency](@entry_id:199161), to highlight its strengths as a robust and reliable electronic structure method for studying excited states.

### The Polarization Propagator: A Bridge to Electronic Excitations

In the study of how an electronic system responds to an external electromagnetic field, the central theoretical object is the **[polarization propagator](@entry_id:201288)**. It quantifies the correlation between fluctuations in the system's charge or [current density](@entry_id:190690) at different points in space and time. There are several related forms of the propagator, and understanding their precise definitions and interconnections is crucial.

Let us consider a many-electron system with a time-independent Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ and a non-degenerate ground state $|\Psi_0\rangle$. When the system interacts with a perturbation described by a Hermitian one-body operator $\hat{\mu}$ (such as the electric dipole operator), the response is encoded in [correlation functions](@entry_id:146839) of $\hat{\mu}$. In the Heisenberg picture, the operator evolves in time as $\hat{\mu}(t) = \exp(i\hat{H}t)\hat{\mu}\exp(-i\hat{H}t)$.

The **causal** or **time-ordered [polarization propagator](@entry_id:201288)**, denoted $P^{\mathrm{T}}(t)$, is defined as:
$P^{\mathrm{T}}(t) = -i \langle \Psi_0 | \mathcal{T} \, \hat{\mu}(t) \hat{\mu}(0) | \Psi_0 \rangle$
where $\mathcal{T}$ is the Wick [time-ordering operator](@entry_id:148044), which places operators at later times to the left. The ADC method is most directly formulated as an approximation to the frequency-domain representation of this [propagator](@entry_id:139558), $P^{\mathrm{T}}(\omega)$.

However, the quantity directly related to experimental [observables](@entry_id:267133) like [absorption spectra](@entry_id:176058) is the **retarded response function**, $\chi^{\mathrm{R}}(t)$:
$\chi^{\mathrm{R}}(t) = -i \theta(t) \langle \Psi_0 | [\hat{\mu}(t), \hat{\mu}(0)] | \Psi_0 \rangle$
Here, $\theta(t)$ is the Heaviside [step function](@entry_id:158924), enforcing causality by ensuring the response occurs only after the perturbation, and $[\cdot, \cdot]$ is the commutator. The [absorption cross-section](@entry_id:172609) for single-photon processes is proportional to $\omega \cdot \mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{R}}(\omega)]$ for positive frequencies $\omega$.

The justification for using ADC, which calculates $P^{\mathrm{T}}(\omega)$, to obtain physical spectra comes from the deep connection between these two [propagators](@entry_id:153170) [@problem_id:2873811]. This connection is most clearly revealed through their spectral (Lehmann) representations, obtained by inserting a complete set of exact eigenstates $\{|\Psi_n\rangle\}$ of the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$. The frequency-domain representations, using the convention $f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dt \, e^{i \omega t} f(t)$, are:
$P^{\mathrm{T}}(\omega) = \sum_{n \neq 0} |\mu_{0n}|^2 \left[ \frac{1}{\omega - \Omega_{n0} + i\eta} - \frac{1}{\omega + \Omega_{n0} - i\eta} \right]$
$\chi^{\mathrm{R}}(\omega) = \sum_{n \neq 0} |\mu_{0n}|^2 \left[ \frac{1}{\omega - \Omega_{n0} + i\eta} - \frac{1}{\omega + \Omega_{n0} + i\eta} \right]$
where $\Omega_{n0} = E_n - E_0$ are the exact [vertical excitation](@entry_id:200515) energies, $\mu_{0n} = \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{\mu} | \Psi_n \rangle$ are the transition moments, and $\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal.

These expressions reveal crucial differences in the analytic structure of the two [propagators](@entry_id:153170). The poles of $\chi^{\mathrm{R}}(\omega)$ are located at $\omega = \pm \Omega_{n0} - i\eta$, meaning they all lie in the lower half of the [complex frequency plane](@entry_id:190333). This is a direct consequence of its causal nature. In contrast, the poles of $P^{\mathrm{T}}(\omega)$ are at $\omega = \Omega_{n0} - i\eta$ and $\omega = -\Omega_{n0} + i\eta$; they appear in both the lower and upper half-planes.

Despite this difference, their imaginary parts on the real axis are simply related. Using the Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem, one can show that $\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{R}}(\omega)] = \mathrm{sgn}(\omega) \cdot \mathrm{Im}[P^{\mathrm{T}}(\omega)]$ [@problem_id:2873811]. For positive frequencies ($\omega > 0$), which correspond to absorption processes, we have $\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{R}}(\omega)] = \mathrm{Im}[P^{\mathrm{T}}(\omega)]$. This identity is profound: it guarantees that an accurate calculation of the time-ordered [propagator](@entry_id:139558), as performed by ADC, directly yields the imaginary part of the retarded [response function](@entry_id:138845) needed to simulate [absorption spectra](@entry_id:176058). Furthermore, the causal nature of $\chi^{\mathrm{R}}(\omega)$ ensures that its real and imaginary parts are connected by the **Kramers–Kronig relations**, a fundamental result of [linear response theory](@entry_id:140367).

### The Dyson Equation and the Role of the Irreducible Propagator

While the Lehmann representation provides formal insight, it is not a practical computational starting point as it requires knowledge of the exact eigenstates. Many-body [perturbation theory](@entry_id:138766) offers a more constructive approach. It reformulates the problem not in terms of the full [propagator](@entry_id:139558), but in terms of a more fundamental object: the **irreducible [polarization propagator](@entry_id:201288)**.

Let us consider the response of the system's electron density, $\delta n(\mathbf{r}, \omega)$, to a weak external potential, $\delta v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\mathbf{r}, \omega)$. The full, or **reducible**, [polarization propagator](@entry_id:201288) $P(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}'; \omega)$ is defined as the [linear response function](@entry_id:160418) connecting these two quantities:
$\delta n(\mathbf{r}, \omega) = \int d\mathbf{r}' \, P(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}'; \omega) \, \delta v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\mathbf{r}', \omega)$
In a [diagrammatic expansion](@entry_id:139147), $P$ includes all possible interaction pathways between the initial and final particle-hole pairs.

The external potential induces a change in the electron density, which in turn generates an induced internal potential via the electron-electron Coulomb interaction, $v(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}') = 1/|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|$. The total potential felt by an electron is thus the sum of the external and induced potentials: $\delta v_{\mathrm{tot}} = \delta v_{\mathrm{ext}} + v \cdot \delta n$. The **irreducible [polarization propagator](@entry_id:201288)**, $\Pi(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}'; \omega)$, is defined as the response of the density to this *total* potential [@problem_id:2873814]:
$\delta n(\mathbf{r}, \omega) = \int d\mathbf{r}' \, \Pi(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}'; \omega) \, \delta v_{\mathrm{tot}}(\mathbf{r}', \omega)$
Diagrammatically, $\Pi$ consists of all diagrams contributing to the polarization that are "irreducible" with respect to being cut into two disconnected pieces by severing a single Coulomb interaction line.

By substituting the expression for $\delta v_{\mathrm{tot}}$ into the definition of $\Pi$, we can establish a self-consistent relationship between the reducible and irreducible [propagators](@entry_id:153170). In operator notation, this relationship is expressed by the **Dyson-like equation**:
$P(\omega) = \Pi(\omega) + \Pi(\omega) \, v \, P(\omega)$
This equation is exact and represents a cornerstone of [many-body theory](@entry_id:169452). It recasts the problem of finding the full [propagator](@entry_id:139558) $P(\omega)$ (which contains infinite classes of diagrams) into the problem of finding the irreducible kernel $\Pi(\omega)$ and then solving the equation. The equation effectively performs an infinite-order resummation of all diagrams that are reducible via the Coulomb interaction $v$. This is the theoretical foundation upon which the ADC method is built.

### The Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction (ADC) Philosophy

The Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction provides a strategy for systematically approximating the [polarization propagator](@entry_id:201288) by leveraging the structure of the Dyson equation. The core philosophy of ADC is to avoid a direct, and ultimately divergent, [perturbative expansion](@entry_id:159275) of the full propagator $P(\omega)$. Instead, it pursues a more sophisticated two-step process [@problem_id:2873855].

First, the irreducible kernel $\Pi(\omega)$ is expanded using Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT) based on the Møller–Plesset (MP) partitioning of the Hamiltonian, $\hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \lambda\hat{V}$, where $\hat{H}_0$ is typically the Fock operator and $\hat{V}$ is the fluctuation potential. The kernel is then approximated by truncating this series at a given order $n$:
$\Pi(\omega) \approx \Pi^{(n)}(\omega) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \lambda^k \Pi^{[k]}(\omega)$

Second, this approximate kernel $\Pi^{(n)}(\omega)$ is used to solve the Dyson equation for $P(\omega)$ *non-perturbatively*. This algebraic resummation is the defining feature of ADC and is responsible for its [robust performance](@entry_id:274615). This process ensures that the resulting approximate propagator, $P_{\mathrm{ADC}(n)}(\omega)$, has the correct analytic structure (i.e., a pole expansion) and is not merely a polynomial in $\omega^{-1}$, which would be the result of a simple truncation of the series for $P(\omega)$ itself.

The ADC schemes form a hierarchy of methods, denoted ADC(n), where $n$ indicates the order of [perturbation theory](@entry_id:138766) through which the irreducible kernel is treated. This construction ensures that the ADC(n) method is **consistent to order $n$**. This is a precise technical term meaning that the pole positions ([excitation energies](@entry_id:190368)) and residues (related to transition strengths) calculated by ADC(n), when re-expanded as a [perturbation series](@entry_id:266790) in $\lambda$, correctly reproduce the exact MBPT results for these quantities through order $\lambda^n$ and $\lambda^{n-1}$, respectively [@problem_id:2873855] [@problem_id:2873818]. This provides a clear and systematic path for improving the accuracy of the calculations by moving to higher orders in the ADC hierarchy.

### The Intermediate State Representation: From Diagrams to Matrices

The algebraic resummation at the heart of ADC is made computationally feasible through the **Intermediate State Representation (ISR)**. The ISR provides a way to transform the complex, frequency-dependent [propagator](@entry_id:139558) problem into a more familiar, frequency-independent [matrix eigenvalue problem](@entry_id:142446).

Instead of working with the unknown exact excited states $|\Psi_n\rangle$, the ISR introduces a basis of so-called **intermediate states** (IS). These states, denoted $|\widetilde{\Psi}_J\rangle$, are generated by applying normal-ordered strings of [creation and annihilation operators](@entry_id:147121) to the correlated ground state $|\Psi_0\rangle$. These operators correspond to [particle-hole excitations](@entry_id:137289) of increasing rank, such as $1p1h$, $2p2h$, $3p3h$, and so on [@problem_id:2873834]:
- $1p1h$ states: generated by operators like $\hat{N}(\hat{a}_a^\dagger \hat{a}_i)$
- $2p2h$ states: generated by operators like $\hat{N}(\hat{a}_a^\dagger \hat{a}_b^\dagger \hat{a}_j \hat{a}_i)$

A crucial feature of the ISR formalism is that this basis of intermediate states is constructed to be **orthonormal**, $\langle \widetilde{\Psi}_I | \widetilde{\Psi}_J \rangle = \delta_{IJ}$. This is achieved through a suitable [orthonormalization](@entry_id:140791) procedure (e.g., symmetric [orthonormalization](@entry_id:140791)) applied to the initial, generally non-orthogonal, set of generated states.

With this orthonormal basis in hand, the propagator problem can be recast as a standard Hermitian [eigenvalue problem](@entry_id:143898):
$\mathbf{M} \mathbf{Y}_K = \Omega_K \mathbf{Y}_K$
Here, $\mathbf{M}$ is the **ADC secular matrix**, whose elements are given by the [matrix representation](@entry_id:143451) of the shifted Hamiltonian in the ISR basis, $M_{IJ} = \langle \widetilde{\Psi}_I | (\hat{H} - E_0) | \widetilde{\Psi}_J \rangle$. The eigenvalues $\Omega_K$ of this matrix are the approximate [excitation energies](@entry_id:190368) (the poles of the propagator), and the eigenvectors $\mathbf{Y}_K$, along with effective transition moment vectors, determine the residues (transition strengths). This formulation guarantees that the calculated [excitation energies](@entry_id:190368) are always real, a significant advantage of the ADC method.

### Constructing the ADC Matrix: A Perturbative Approach

The elements of the ADC matrix $\mathbf{M}$ are not calculated exactly, but are themselves derived from a [perturbative expansion](@entry_id:159275) consistent with the chosen order of the ADC(n) scheme. The systematic construction of $\mathbf{M}$ is rooted in the [diagrammatic expansion](@entry_id:139147) of the [polarization propagator](@entry_id:201288) using [the interaction picture](@entry_id:198213) and Wick's theorem [@problem_id:2873786].

For a Hartree-Fock reference state, a key simplifying principle is **Brillouin's theorem**, which states that the matrix element of the full Hamiltonian between the HF ground state $|\Phi_0\rangle$ and any singly excited determinant $|\Phi_i^a\rangle$ is zero, $\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H} | \Phi_i^a \rangle = 0$. In the MP partitioning, this directly implies that the first-order coupling between the ground state and the $1p1h$ space vanishes: $\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{W} | \Phi_i^a \rangle = 0$ [@problem_id:2873858]. This provides a rigorous justification for constructing the ADC matrix within a space of excited configurations, as the ground state decouples from the $1p1h$ space at the lowest order of interaction.

#### The ADC(1) Scheme

The simplest non-trivial scheme is ADC(1). In this approximation, the ISR is restricted to the space of $1p1h$ excitations, and the matrix elements of $\mathbf{M}$ are computed through first order in the fluctuation potential $\hat{W}$. The resulting ADC(1) secular matrix has a clear structure [@problem_id:2873831]:
- **Diagonal elements**: $M_{ia,ia} = \epsilon_a - \epsilon_i$. These are the zeroth-order particle-hole energy differences from the underlying Fock operator.
- **Off-diagonal elements**: $M_{ia,jb} = \langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{W} | \Phi_j^b \rangle$. These are the first-order [interaction terms](@entry_id:637283), given by antisymmetrized [two-electron integrals](@entry_id:261879).

This matrix is precisely the Hamiltonian matrix that is diagonalized in the **Configuration Interaction Singles (CIS)** method. For closed-shell systems, CIS is also known to be equivalent to the **Tamm–Dancoff Approximation (TDA)** to Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF). Thus, ADC(1) provides a physically transparent starting point for the ADC hierarchy, as it reproduces a well-known and intuitive method that describes [excited states](@entry_id:273472) as a [linear combination](@entry_id:155091) of single excitations [@problem_id:2873831] [@problem_id:2873858].

#### The ADC(2) Scheme

The ADC(2) scheme provides the first level of theory that systematically includes electron correlation effects beyond the mean-field-like picture of CIS. This is achieved by expanding the ISR to include both $1p1h$ and $2p2h$ configurations and constructing the secular matrix with elements accurate to the appropriate order. The resulting matrix has a block structure [@problem_id:2873786] [@problem_id:2873818]:
$\mathbf{M}^{\mathrm{ADC}(2)} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{M}_{1p1h, 1p1h} & \mathbf{M}_{1p1h, 2p2h} \\ \mathbf{M}_{2p2h, 1p1h} & \mathbf{M}_{2p2h, 2p2h} \end{pmatrix}$

The blocks are constructed as follows:
- **$\mathbf{M}_{2p2h, 2p2h}$**: This block is treated at zeroth order. It is a diagonal matrix containing the unperturbed $2p2h$ [excitation energies](@entry_id:190368), e.g., $\epsilon_a + \epsilon_b - \epsilon_i - \epsilon_j$.
- **$\mathbf{M}_{1p1h, 2p2h}$**: This block couples the single and double excitation manifolds. The coupling operator is the fluctuation potential $\hat{W}$, so the matrix elements are first order in the interaction.
- **$\mathbf{M}_{1p1h, 1p1h}$**: This is the most sophisticated block. In addition to the zeroth-order ([orbital energies](@entry_id:182840)) and first-order (CIS-like) terms, it includes [second-order corrections](@entry_id:199233). These second-order terms arise diagrammatically from processes where a $1p1h$ excitation virtually scatters into a $2p2h$ state and back, via two applications of the interaction $\hat{W}$. This represents the [dynamic correlation](@entry_id:195235) feedback from the double-excitation manifold onto the single excitations [@problem_id:2873818] [@problem_id:2873858].

By explicitly including the $2p2h$ states in the secular problem, ADC(2) has a significant qualitative advantage over CIS and TDHF: it can describe [excited states](@entry_id:273472) that have substantial **double-excitation character**. Such states are common in many molecular systems but are entirely absent from the spectrum of any method restricted to the $1p1h$ space. The energies of these double-excitation states are, however, only correct to zeroth order in the strict ADC(2) scheme.

### Formal Properties and Comparisons

The specific way the ADC(n) schemes are constructed endows them with several desirable formal properties that make them powerful and reliable tools in quantum chemistry.

#### Hermiticity and Stability

A key distinction between ADC and TDHF/RPA lies in the mathematical structure of their respective secular equations [@problem_id:2873787]. The full TDHF/RPA method leads to a non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem, often written as the **Casida equation**. This non-Hermitian structure can lead to solutions with complex eigenvalues (unstable, unphysical excitations) if the underlying Hartree-Fock [reference state](@entry_id:151465) is unstable with respect to [electron-hole pair](@entry_id:142506) formation (a so-called Thouless instability).

In stark contrast, the ADC framework, through its use of an orthonormal ISR, results in a standard **Hermitian eigenvalue problem** at every finite order $n$. A [fundamental theorem of linear algebra](@entry_id:190797) states that a Hermitian matrix always has real eigenvalues. This means that ADC calculations are guaranteed to produce real [excitation energies](@entry_id:190368), regardless of the stability of the HF reference. The ADC formalism effectively "regularizes" the [propagator](@entry_id:139558) problem, transforming it from a representation with an indefinite metric (as in RPA) to one with a [positive-definite metric](@entry_id:203038), thereby ensuring mathematical and physical robustness [@problem_id:2873787].

#### Size-Consistency and Size-Extensivity

A hallmark of a high-quality electronic structure method is its correct behavior when applied to a system of non-interacting subsystems. For a supermolecule composed of two non-interacting fragments, $A$ and $B$, the set of [excitation energies](@entry_id:190368) of the combined system should simply be the union of the [excitation energies](@entry_id:190368) of $A$ and $B$ individually. This property is known as **[size-consistency](@entry_id:199161)** for [excitation energies](@entry_id:190368). Similarly, [extensive properties](@entry_id:145410) like transition intensities should be additive, a property known as **[size-extensivity](@entry_id:144932)**.

The ADC(n) hierarchy is rigorously size-consistent and size-extensive at every finite order $n$ [@problem_id:2873824]. This desirable property is a direct consequence of its diagrammatic foundation. The [polarization propagator](@entry_id:201288) is given by the sum of only **connected** (or linked) diagrams. For a system of non-interacting fragments, any connected diagram must be entirely localized on one fragment. Therefore, the ADC(n) approximation, which is a systematic truncation of this connected-diagram expansion, remains strictly separable. In the ISR, this translates to a block-diagonal ADC matrix for the composite system, guaranteeing the separability of the spectrum.

It is important to note a practical consideration. In a numerical calculation on a supermolecule, the standard procedure of canonicalizing the [molecular orbitals](@entry_id:266230) can artificially mix orbitals from different fragments if accidental degeneracies are present. This numerical artifact can mask the formal [size-consistency](@entry_id:199161) of the underlying theory. To realize the property in practice, one must employ an orbital basis that respects the fragment separation, for instance, by using [localized molecular orbitals](@entry_id:195971) or a block-canonical basis [@problem_id:2873824].
