(ii) Prove that all odd-order static hyperpolarizabilities vanish.\n\n**Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it describes the canonical quantum harmonic oscillator under a static electric field, a fundamental model in quantum mechanics. It is well-posed, with all necessary components defined, and objective in its language. The assumptions are consistent. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and we may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Static Linear Polarizability $\\alpha$**\n\nWe begin with the definition of the static polarizability of the ground state, denoted $|0\\rangle$, as a function of its energy $E_0(F)$:\n$$\n\\alpha = -\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 E_0(F)}{\\partial F^2}\\right|_{F=0}\n$$\nTo evaluate this, we use nondegenerate time-independent perturbation theory to find the ground state energy as a power series in the electric field strength $F$. The perturbation Hamiltonian is $V = -qFx$. The ground-state energy $E_0(F)$ is expanded as:\n$$\nE_0(F) = E_0^{(0)} + E_0^{(1)} + E_0^{(2)} + \\dots\n$$\nwhere $E_0^{(k)}$ is the $k$-th order correction to the energy. The unperturbed ground-state energy is $E_0^{(0)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe first-order energy correction is given by the expectation value of the perturbation in the unperturbed ground state $|0\\rangle$:\n$$\nE_0^{(1)} = \\langle 0 | V | 0 \\rangle = \\langle 0 | -qFx | 0 \\rangle = -qF \\langle 0 | x | 0 \\rangle\n$$\nFor the quantum harmonic oscillator, the eigenstates have definite parity. The ground state wavefunction $\\psi_0^{(0)}(x)$ is an even function. The position operator $x$ is an odd operator. The expectation value $\\langle 0 | x | 0 \\rangle$ is the integral of the product $\\psi_0^{(0)*} x \\psi_0^{(0)}$, which is an odd function, over a symmetric interval $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. This integral is identically zero. Therefore:\n$$\nE_0^{(1)} = 0\n$$\n\nThe second-order energy correction is given by:\n$$\nE_0^{(2)} = \\sum_{k \\neq 0} \\frac{|\\langle k | V | 0 \\rangle|^2}{E_0^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}}\n$$\nSubstituting $V = -qFx$ and factoring out the field-dependent terms, we have:\n$$\nE_0^{(2)} = (-qF)^2 \\sum_{k \\neq 0} \\frac{|\\langle k | x | 0 \\rangle|^2}{E_0^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}} = q^2 F^2 \\sum_{k \\neq 0} \\frac{|\\langle k | x | 0 \\rangle|^2}{E_0^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}}\n$$\nTo evaluate the matrix elements $\\langle k | x | 0 \\rangle$, we express the position operator $x$ in terms of the annihilation ($a$) and creation ($a^\\dagger$) operators:\n$$\nx = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}}(a + a^\\dagger)\n$$\nThe action of these operators on the ground state $|0\\rangle$ is $a|0\\rangle = 0$ and $a^\\dagger|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle$. Thus, the matrix element is:\n$$\n\\langle k | x | 0 \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}} \\langle k | a + a^\\dagger | 0 \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}} (\\langle k | a | 0 \\rangle + \\langle k | a^\\dagger | 0 \\rangle) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}} \\langle k | 1 \\rangle\n$$\nThis matrix element is non-zero only for $k=1$, due to the orthogonality condition $\\langle k | 1 \\rangle = \\delta_{k1}$. The sum for $E_0^{(2)}$ collapses to a single term:\n$$\nE_0^{(2)} = q^2 F^2 \\frac{|\\langle 1 | x | 0 \\rangle|^2}{E_0^{(0)} - E_1^{(0)}}\n$$\nThe unperturbed energy levels are $E_n^{(0)} = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$. Thus, $E_0^{(0)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and $E_1^{(0)} = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. The energy denominator is $E_0^{(0)} - E_1^{(0)} = -\\hbar\\omega$. The squared matrix element is $|\\langle 1 | x | 0 \\rangle|^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}$.\nSubstituting these results gives the second-order energy correction:\n$$\nE_0^{(2)} = q^2 F^2 \\frac{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}}{-\\hbar\\omega} = -\\frac{q^2 F^2}{2m\\omega^2}\n$$\nThe ground state energy, up to second order in $F$, is:\n$$\nE_0(F) \\approx E_0^{(0)} + E_0^{(1)} + E_0^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 0 - \\frac{q^2 F^2}{2m\\omega^2}\n$$\nNow, we compute the polarizability from its definition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_0(F)}{\\partial F} \\approx -\\frac{q^2 F}{m\\omega^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E_0(F)}{\\partial F^2} \\approx -\\frac{q^2}{m\\omega^2}\n$$\nThe second derivative is constant, so taking the limit at $F=0$ is trivial.\n$$\n\\alpha = -\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 E_0(F)}{\\partial F^2}\\right|_{F=0} = - \\left( -\\frac{q^2}{m\\omega^2} \\right) = \\frac{q^2}{m\\omega^2}\n$$\nIt is noteworthy that for the harmonic oscillator, this result is exact. The complete Hamiltonian $H(F)$ can be solved exactly by completing the square, which reveals that the energy eigenvalues have a purely quadratic dependence on $F$. Consequently, all perturbation corrections $E_0^{(k)}$ for $k > 2$ are identically zero.\n\n**Part 2: Vanishing of Odd-Order Static Hyperpolarizabilities**\n\nOdd-order static hyperpolarizabilities (e.g., $\\beta$, $\\delta$, ...) are defined through odd-order derivatives of the energy with respect to the field, evaluated at zero field. For example, $\\beta = -\\frac{\\partial^3 E_0(F)}{\\partial F^3}|_{F=0}$. We will prove that all such quantities are zero.\n\nThe proof relies on the symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian.\n1.  The unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0 = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 x^2$ is invariant under the parity transformation $\\mathcal{P}$, which in one dimension means $x \\to -x$ and $p \\to -p$. Both the kinetic energy term ($p^2$) and the potential energy term ($x^2$) are even functions of their respective operators. Thus, $[H_0, \\mathcal{P}] = 0$.\n2.  The perturbation $V(F) = -qFx$ is an odd function of $x$.\n3.  Consider the total Hamiltonian for a field $-F$, which is $H(-F) = H_0 + qFx$. Let us apply the parity operator $\\mathcal{P}$ to $H(-F)$ via a similarity transformation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P} H(-F) \\mathcal{P}^{-1} = \\mathcal{P} (H_0 + qFx) \\mathcal{P}^{-1} = \\mathcal{P}H_0\\mathcal{P}^{-1} + qF (\\mathcal{P}x\\mathcal{P}^{-1})\n$$\nSince $[H_0, \\mathcal{P}]=0$, $\\mathcal{P}H_0\\mathcal{P}^{-1} = H_0$. The position operator transforms as $\\mathcal{P}x\\mathcal{P}^{-1} = -x$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P} H(-F) \\mathcal{P}^{-1} = H_0 - qFx = H(F)\n$$\nThis shows that the Hamiltonians $H(F)$ and $H(-F)$ are unitarily equivalent. Unitarily equivalent operators have identical eigenvalue spectra.\n4.  Let the set of energy eigenvalues of $H(F)$ be $\\{ E_n(F) \\}$. Then we must have $\\{ E_n(F) \\} = \\{ E_n(-F) \\}$.\n5.  The problem states that the stationary states of the unperturbed system are nondegenerate. For small field strengths $F$, this nondegeneracy is preserved. Therefore, the ordering of states is maintained, which implies $E_n(F) = E_n(-F)$ for each individual state $n$.\n6.  The ground state energy $E_0(F)$ must therefore be an even function of the field strength $F$.\n7.  A function that is even, $f(z) = f(-z)$, can only have even powers in its Taylor series expansion around $z=0$: $f(z) = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} c_{2j} z^{2j}$.\n8.  Consequently, the expansion of $E_0(F)$ around $F=0$ must take the form:\n$$\nE_0(F) = E_0^{(0)} + c_2 F^2 + c_4 F^4 + \\dots\n$$\nAll coefficients of odd powers of $F$ must be zero.\n9.  The odd-order hyperpolarizabilities are defined by odd-order derivatives of $E_0(F)$ at $F=0$. For any odd integer $2k+1$ (with $k \\geq 0$):\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial^{2k+1} E_0(F)}{\\partial F^{2k+1}}\\right|_{F=0} = 0\n$$\nThis proves that all odd-order static hyperpolarizabilities of the ground state are zero. This is a general result for any system with a center of inversion symmetry in its unperturbed state.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{q^2}{m\\omega^2}}\n$$", "id": "2915753"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a simple model to a real chemical entity, this practice challenges you to derive the dynamic polarizability, $\\alpha(\\omega)$, of the hydrogen atom.

Starting from Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory (TDPT) and the linear-response formulation of the induced dipole moment, derive the frequency-dependent dipole polarizability $\\alpha(\\omega)$ for the hydrogen ground state as a spectral (sum-over-states) representation.

The final answer must be a single expression or a single row matrix; do not include units inside the final boxed answer.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and addresses a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics: the response of an atomic system to an external time-dependent electromagnetic field. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is a hydrogen atom, initially in its ground state $|g\\rangle = |1s\\rangle$, perturbed by a spatially uniform electric field polarized along the $z$-axis, $\\mathbf{E}(t) = E_0\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\cos(\\omega t)$. We work in atomic units, where $\\hbar = m_e = e = a_0 = 1$. The unperturbed Hamiltonian is the standard hydrogenic Hamiltonian, $H_0$, with eigenstates $|k\\rangle$ and eigenvalues $E_k$. For the ground state, $E_g = E_1 = -1/2$ a.u. The interaction Hamiltonian is $H'(t) = -\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}(t)$, where the dipole operator is $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = -\\mathbf{r}$. The interaction is thus $H'(t) = z E_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$.\n\nThe objective is to find the frequency-dependent dipole polarizability, $\\alpha(\\omega)$, defined through the linear response of the induced dipole moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle_{\\text{ind}} = \\alpha(\\omega) E_z(t)$. We will derive this using time-dependent perturbation theory. The standard result from linear response theory, which is derivable from first-order TDPT by considering an adiabatically switched-on perturbation, gives the complex dynamic polarizability tensor component $\\alpha_{zz}(\\omega)$. For a monochromatic perturbation $E_z(t) = \\text{Re}(E_z(\\omega)e^{-i\\omega t})$, the induced dipole moment is $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\text{Re}(\\alpha_{zz}(\\omega)E_z(\\omega)e^{-i\\omega t})$. The expression for the polarizability is given by the Kubo formula, also known as the Kramers-Heisenberg-Dirac dispersion formula:\n$$\n\\alpha_{zz}(\\omega) = \\sum_{k \\neq g} \\left( \\frac{\\langle g | \\mu_z | k \\rangle \\langle k | \\mu_z | g \\rangle}{E_k - E_g - \\omega - i\\delta} + \\frac{\\langle g | \\mu_z | k \\rangle \\langle k | \\mu_z | g \\rangle}{E_k - E_g + \\omega + i\\delta} \\right)\n$$\nwhere the sum is over the complete set of unperturbed states $|k\\rangle$ (excluding the ground state $|g\\rangle$), and $\\delta$ is an infinitesimal positive quantity ensuring causality. We have used the fact that for a non-degenerate ground state with definite parity, the permanent dipole moment $\\langle g|\\mu_z|g\\rangle$ is zero. In atomic units, $\\mu_z = -z$, and the expression becomes:\n$$\n\\alpha(\\omega) \\equiv \\alpha_{zz}(\\omega) = \\sum_{k \\neq g} |\\langle k|z|g\\rangle|^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{\\omega_{kg} - \\omega - i\\delta} + \\frac{1}{\\omega_{kg} + \\omega + i\\delta} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_{kg} = E_k - E_g$. Combining the terms in the parenthesis, we obtain:\n$$\n\\alpha(\\omega) = \\sum_{k \\neq g} \\frac{2\\omega_{kg}|\\langle k|z|g\\rangle|^2}{\\omega_{kg}^2 - (\\omega+i\\delta)^2} = \\sum_{k \\neq g} \\frac{2\\omega_{kg}|\\langle k|z|g\\rangle|^2}{\\omega_{kg}^2 - \\omega^2 - 2i\\omega\\delta + \\mathcal{O}(\\delta^2)}\n$$\nFor simplicity of notation in the final expression, this is often written with the understanding that the denominator is $\\omega_{kg}^2 - \\omega^2 - i\\eta$ for some positive infinitesimal $\\eta$.\n\nThe next step is to specify the states $|k\\rangle$ for the hydrogen atom. The ground state is $|g\\rangle = |1s\\rangle \\equiv |n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$. The operator is $z = r\\cos\\theta$, which corresponds to the spherical harmonic $Y_{10}$. The Wigner-Eckart theorem dictates the dipole selection rules for the matrix element $\\langle k|z|1s\\rangle$:\n$1$. The change in orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$. Since the initial state has $l=0$, the final states must have $l=1$ (p-states).\n$2$. The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0$. Since the initial state has $m=0$, the final states must also have $m=0$.\nThus, the sum over states $|k\\rangle$ is restricted to states of the form $|n, l=1, m=0\\rangle$ and $|E, l=1, m=0\\rangle$.\n\nThe spectrum of the hydrogen atom consists of discrete bound states and a continuum of unbound states. We must resolve the identity operator (the sum over $|k\\rangle\\langle k|$) over this full spectrum.\n$1$. The discrete spectrum consists of bound states $|np, m=0\\rangle$ for principal quantum numbers $n=2, 3, \\ldots, \\infty$. The energy of these states is $E_n = -1/(2n^2)$ a.u.\n$2$. The continuum spectrum consists of unbound states $|Ep, m=0\\rangle$ with continuous energy $E \\ge 0$. These states are energy-normalized.\n\nWe can now write the polarizability by splitting the sum into a sum over the discrete part of the spectrum and an integral over the continuum part:\n$$\n\\alpha(\\omega) = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{2\\omega_{n1}|\\langle np,m=0|z|1s\\rangle|^2}{\\omega_{n1}^2 - \\omega^2 - i\\delta'} + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dE \\frac{2\\omega_{E1}|\\langle Ep,m=0|z|1s\\rangle|^2}{\\omega_{E1}^2 - \\omega^2 - i\\delta''}\n$$\nwhere we use a generic infinitesimal $\\delta$ in the final answer. The transition energies are:\nFor discrete states: $\\omega_{n1} = E_n - E_1 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2n^2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2n^2}$.\nFor continuum states: $\\omega_{E1} = E - E_1 = E - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = E + \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting these energy differences into the expression for $\\alpha(\\omega)$, and using the specified notation for the matrix elements $|\\langle 1s|z|k\\rangle|^2 = |\\langle k|z|1s\\rangle|^2$ for the Hermitian operator $z$, we arrive at the final analytical form:\n$$\n\\alpha(\\omega) = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{2\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2n^2}\\right)|\\langle 1s|z|np,m=0\\rangle|^2}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2n^2}\\right)^2 - \\omega^2 - i\\delta} + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dE \\frac{2\\left(E + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)|\\langle 1s|z|Ep,m=0\\rangle|^2}{\\left(E + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\omega^2 - i\\delta}\n$$\nThis is the complete spectral representation of the dynamic dipole polarizability of the hydrogen ground state.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to identify the angular frequency at which continuum contributions first occur. This corresponds to the photoionization threshold, which is the minimum energy required to excite the electron from the ground state to the continuum. The continuum begins at energy $E=0$. The ground state energy is $E_1 = -1/2$ a.u.\nThe threshold frequency $\\omega_{th}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\omega_{th} = E_{\\text{continuum, min}} - E_1 = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ a.u.}\n$$\nFor driving frequencies $\\omega \\ge 1/2$ a.u., the atom can be photoionized, leading to an absorptive component in the polarizability contributed by the integral term. This is evident from the pole structure of the integrand. The imaginary part of $\\alpha(\\omega)$ arises from the poles in the denominator, which occur when $\\omega \\approx \\omega_{k1}$. For the continuum part, this corresponds to $\\omega \\approx E + 1/2$.

All calculations are performed in atomic units.\n\n**Part 1: Extraction of the Second Hyperpolarizability $\\gamma_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0)$**\n\nThe energy of the molecule in the presence of the static electric field $F_{z}$, $E(F_{z})$, can be expanded as a Taylor series around $F_{z}=0$:\n$$\nE(F_{z}) = E(0) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial F_{z}}\\right)_{F_{z}=0} F_{z} + \\frac{1}{2!} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} E}{\\partial F_{z}^{2}}\\right)_{F_{z}=0} F_{z}^{2} + \\frac{1}{3!} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{3} E}{\\partial F_{z}^{3}}\\right)_{F_{z}=0} F_{z}^{3} + \\frac{1}{4!} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{4} E}{\\partial F_{z}^{4}}\\right)_{F_{z}=0} F_{z}^{4} + O(F_{z}^{5})\n$$\nThe problem states that the field-derivative definition of electric response tensors should be used. For a static field along the $z$ axis, the permanent dipole moment ($\\mu_{z}$), polarizability ($\\alpha_{zz}$), first hyperpolarizability ($\\beta_{zzz}$), and second hyperpolarizability ($\\gamma_{zzzz}$) are defined as follows:\n$$\n\\mu_{z} = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial F_{z}}\\right)_{F_{z}=0}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{zz} = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} E}{\\partial F_{z}^{2}}\\right)_{F_{z}=0}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_{zzz} = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{3} E}{\\partial F_{z}^{3}}\\right)_{F_{z}=0}\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0) = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{4} E}{\\partial F_{z}^{4}}\\right)_{F_{z}=0}\n$$\nThe notation $\\gamma_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0)$ explicitly denotes a static property, which is consistent with the use of a static field $F_z$. Substituting these definitions into the Taylor series for the energy gives:\n$$\nE(F_{z}) = E(0) - \\mu_{z} F_{z} - \\frac{1}{2!} \\alpha_{zz} F_{z}^{2} - \\frac{1}{3!} \\beta_{zzz} F_{z}^{3} - \\frac{1}{4!} \\gamma_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0) F_{z}^{4} + O(F_{z}^{5})\n$$\nThe problem involves fitting the computed energies to the quartic model:\n$$\nE(F_{z}) \\approx a_{0} + a_{1} F_{z} + a_{2} F_{z}^{2} + a_{3} F_{z}^{3} + a_{4} F_{z}^{4}\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the powers of $F_{z}$ in the theoretical Taylor expansion and the fitted polynomial, we can associate the fitted coefficients $\\{a_i\\}$ with the physical properties. Specifically, for the coefficient of the $F_{z}^{4}$ term, we have:\n$$\na_{4} \\approx \\frac{1}{4!} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{4} E}{\\partial F_{z}^{4}}\\right)_{F_{z}=0}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the second hyperpolarizability, this becomes:\n$$\na_{4} \\approx -\\frac{1}{4!} \\gamma_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0)\n$$\nSince $4! = 24$, we have $a_{4} \\approx -\\frac{1}{24} \\gamma_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0)$.\nTherefore, the estimate for the second hyperpolarizability component, here denoted $\\gamma_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0)$, can be extracted from the fitted coefficient $a_{4}$ as:\n$$\n\\gamma_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0) = -24 a_{4}\n$$\nThe multiplicative constant is $-24$.\n\n**Part 2: Standard Uncertainty of the Estimate of $\\gamma_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0)$**\n\nThis part requires results from the theory of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The vector of estimated coefficients, $\\hat{a}$, has a covariance matrix given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cov}(\\hat{a}) = \\sigma^{2} (X^{\\top} X)^{-1}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma^{2}$ is the true variance of the errors in the energy calculations. Since $\\sigma^{2}$ is unknown, it is replaced by its unbiased estimator $s^{2} = \\frac{\\mathrm{RSS}}{N-p}$, where $p=5$ is the number of fitted parameters. The estimated covariance matrix of $\\hat{a}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Cov}}(\\hat{a}) = s^{2} (X^{\\top} X)^{-1} = \\frac{\\mathrm{RSS}}{N-5} (X^{\\top} X)^{-1}\n$$\nThe variance of a specific coefficient estimate, $\\hat{a}_{j}$, is the corresponding diagonal element of this matrix. For the coefficient $\\hat{a}_{4}$ (the fifth coefficient, corresponding to the index $j=5$), the estimated variance is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{a}_{4}) = \\frac{\\mathrm{RSS}}{N-5} \\left[ (X^{\\top} X)^{-1} \\right]_{55}\n$$\nwhere $\\left[ (X^{\\top} X)^{-1} \\right]_{55}$ denotes the $(5,5)$ element of the matrix $(X^{\\top} X)^{-1}$.\n\nFrom Part 1, the estimate of the hyperpolarizability, denoted $\\hat{\\gamma}_{zzzz}$, is related to the estimate of the coefficient, $\\hat{a}_{4}$, by a constant factor:\n$$\n\\hat{\\gamma}_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0) = -24 \\hat{a}_{4}\n$$\nThe variance of a random variable scaled by a constant $c$ is given by the rule $\\mathrm{Var}(cZ) = c^{2}\\mathrm{Var}(Z)$. Applying this rule to find the estimated variance of $\\hat{\\gamma}_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0)$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\gamma}_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0)) = \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(-24 \\hat{a}_{4}) = (-24)^{2} \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{a}_{4}) = 576 \\, \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{a}_{4})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{a}_{4})$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\gamma}_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0)) = 576 \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{RSS}}{N-5} \\right) \\left[ (X^{\\top} X)^{-1} \\right]_{55}\n$$\nThe standard uncertainty, often denoted as the standard error, is the positive square root of the estimated variance. Let this be $u(\\hat{\\gamma}_{zzzz})$.\n$$\nu(\\hat{\\gamma}_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0)) = \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\gamma}_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0))} = \\sqrt{576 \\frac{\\mathrm{RSS}}{N-5} \\left[ (X^{\\top} X)^{-1} \\right]_{55}}\n$$\n$$\nu(\\hat{\\gamma}_{zzzz}(0;0,0,0)) = 24 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathrm{RSS}}{N-5} \\left[ (X^{\\top} X)^{-1} \\right]_{55}}\n$$\nThis expression provides the standard uncertainty of the hyperpolarizability estimate in terms of the specified quantities.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-24 a_{4} & 24 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathrm{RSS}}{N-5} \\left[ (X^{\\top} X)^{-1} \\right]_{55}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2915758"}]}
