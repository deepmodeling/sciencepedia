This practice [@problem_id:2904117] provides a hands-on look at how these components are determined in modern computational chemistry, using energy gap fluctuations from molecular dynamics to find $\\lambda_{out}$ and vibrational mode analysis to find $\\lambda_{in}$.", "problem": "You are asked to formalize a thermodynamic cycle that combines Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Quantum Chemistry (QC) to compute the total Marcus reorganization energy as the sum of an outer-sphere component from solvent fluctuations and an inner-sphere component from intramolecular vibrations. Your task is to implement a complete program that, based on the cycle and first-principles reasoning, computes numerical values for the outer-sphere and inner-sphere contributions and their sum, for a provided test suite.\n\nThe derivation must start from a fundamental base appropriate for electron transfer in condensed phase: harmonic free-energy surfaces for diabatic states, the Boltzmann distribution at temperature $T$, linear response and the Fluctuation–Dissipation Theorem (FDT), and the harmonic oscillator description of intramolecular normal modes. You must proceed from these principles to an algorithm that:\n- Uses the statistics of vertical energy-gap fluctuations from classical MD at a fixed temperature $T$ to determine the outer-sphere reorganization energy.\n- Uses the normal-mode picture from QC (for small displacements between donor and acceptor equilibrium structures) to determine the inner-sphere reorganization energy directly from mode-resolved properties.\n\nDo not use or quote any pre-packaged electron-transfer formula as a starting point in your derivation. Instead, justify each step from the above fundamental base, and then implement it.\n\nMathematical and physical requirements to observe:\n- Treat the solvent coordinate as Gaussian under linear response, and relate the curvature of the harmonic free-energy surface to the variance of the vertical energy gap at temperature $T$ through equilibrium fluctuation theory.\n- Treat the intramolecular modes as independent harmonic oscillators, and express the reorganization energy in terms of mode energies and displacements.

It requires a correct derivation from fundamental principles and their application to numerical data.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the derivation and solution.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe electron transfer process is described as a transition between two diabatic electronic states, a reactant state $R$ (e.g., donor-localized charge) and a product state $P$ (e.g., acceptor-localized charge). The energy of these states depends on the configuration of the surrounding solvent and the internal geometry of the molecule. We partition the nuclear coordinates into two sets: a collective coordinate for the solvent, $X$, and a set of internal vibrational normal mode coordinates, $\\{q_j\\}$. We assume these are separable.\n\n**1. Outer-Sphere Reorganization Energy ($\\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}}$)**\n\nWe model the solvent's effect through a single collective coordinate, $X$. Within the linear response approximation, the free energy surfaces of the reactant ($G_R$) and product ($G_P$) states as a function of $X$ are parabolic:\n$$ G_R(X) = \\frac{1}{2} k X^2 $$\n$$ G_P(X) = \\frac{1}{2} k (X - X_0)^2 + \\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}} $$\nHere, we have set the minimum of the reactant surface at $X=0$ for convenience. The product surface has the same curvature (force constant $k$) and is shifted to a minimum at $X=X_0$. $\\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}}$ is the free energy change of the reaction at the product's equilibrium geometry.\n\nThe outer-sphere reorganization energy, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}}$, is defined as the energy required to move the system from the reactant's equilibrium configuration ($X=0$) to the product's equilibrium configuration ($X=X_0$) while remaining on the reactant free energy surface.\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} = G_R(X_0) - G_R(0) = \\frac{1}{2} k X_0^2 $$\n\nThe problem requires us to connect this to the fluctuations of the vertical energy gap, $\\Delta E(X) = G_P(X) - G_R(X)$.\n$$ \\Delta E(X) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} k (X - X_0)^2 + \\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} k X^2 \\right) = -k X_0 X + \\frac{1}{2} k X_0^2 + \\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}} $$\nRecognizing that $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{1}{2} k X_0^2$, we can write:\n$$ \\Delta E(X) = -k X_0 X + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} + \\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}} $$\n\nIn a classical MD simulation of the reactant state, the system samples configurations $X$ according to the Boltzmann distribution $P(X) \\propto \\exp(-G_R(X) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T))$. Since $G_R(X)$ is quadratic, the distribution of $X$ is Gaussian with mean $\\langle X \\rangle = 0$ and variance $\\sigma_X^2 = \\langle X^2 \\rangle - \\langle X \\rangle^2 = \\langle X^2 \\rangle$. From equilibrium statistical mechanics for a harmonic potential, this variance is given by $\\sigma_X^2 = k_{\\mathrm{B}} T / k$.\n\nWe now compute the variance of the energy gap, $\\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2$, over the equilibrium fluctuations of the reactant state. The mean energy gap is $\\langle \\Delta E \\rangle = \\langle -k X_0 X + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} + \\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}} \\rangle = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} + \\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}}$, since $\\langle X \\rangle = 0$.\nThe variance is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2 = \\langle (\\Delta E - \\langle \\Delta E \\rangle)^2 \\rangle = \\langle (-k X_0 X)^2 \\rangle = (k X_0)^2 \\langle X^2 \\rangle $$\nSubstituting $\\langle X^2 \\rangle = k_{\\mathrm{B}} T / k$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2 = (k X_0)^2 \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{k} = k X_0^2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T $$\nWe have two relations: $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{1}{2} k X_0^2$ and $\\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2 = k X_0^2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$. We can eliminate the microscopic parameters $k$ and $X_0$ by noting that $k X_0^2 = \\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2 / (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}}$ yields the desired result, an instance of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} $$\nThe variance $\\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2$ is computed from the provided MD time series of $\\Delta E$ values. For a sample of size $N$, the population variance is $\\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (\\Delta E_i - \\mu_{\\Delta E})^2$, where $\\mu_{\\Delta E} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\Delta E_i$.\n\n**2. Inner-Sphere Reorganization Energy ($\\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}}$)**\n\nIntramolecular vibrations are treated as a set of independent harmonic oscillators. For a single normal mode $j$ with coordinate $q_j$ and angular frequency $\\omega_j$, the potential energy surfaces for the reactant and product electronic states are:\n$$ V_R(q_j) = \\frac{1}{2} m_j \\omega_j^2 q_j^2 $$\n$$ V_P(q_j) = \\frac{1}{2} m_j \\omega_j^2 (q_j - d_j)^2 $$\nwhere $d_j$ is the displacement in the equilibrium geometry along mode $j$ upon electron transfer.\n\nThe inner-sphere reorganization energy for this mode, $\\lambda_{j, \\mathrm{in}}$, is the energy to distort the reactant from its equilibrium ($q_j=0$) to the product's equilibrium geometry ($q_j=d_j$):\n$$ \\lambda_{j, \\mathrm{in}} = V_R(d_j) - V_R(0) = \\frac{1}{2} m_j \\omega_j^2 d_j^2 $$\nThe problem provides the dimensionless Huang-Rhys factor, $S_j$, which is defined as the reorganization energy in units of the vibrational energy quantum, $\\hbar \\omega_j$:\n$$ S_j = \\frac{\\lambda_{j, \\mathrm{in}}}{\\hbar \\omega_j} $$\nTherefore, $\\lambda_{j, \\mathrm{in}} = S_j \\hbar \\omega_j$. The quantum of vibrational energy can be expressed using the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_j$ (in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) via the relation $\\Delta E_j = h c \\tilde{\\nu}_j$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light. Note that $\\hbar \\omega_j = h c \\tilde{\\nu}_j$.\nSo, the contribution from mode $j$ is:\n$$ \\lambda_{j, \\mathrm{in}} = S_j (h c \\tilde{\\nu}_j) $$\nSince the modes are independent, the total inner-sphere reorganization energy is the sum over all modes:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\sum_j \\lambda_{j, \\mathrm{in}} = \\sum_j S_j (h c \\tilde{\\nu}_j) $$\nThe energy term $h c \\tilde{\\nu}_j$ is calculated using the provided conversion factor from $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to $\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n**3. Total Reorganization Energy ($\\lambda$)**\n\nUnder the assumption of separability between solvent and intramolecular coordinates, the total reorganization energy is the sum of the outer-sphere and inner-sphere contributions:\n$$ \\lambda = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\n\nThis completes the derivation required to implement the solution.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes outer-sphere, inner-sphere, and total Marcus reorganization energies\n    for a suite of test cases based on first-principles derivations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constants as specified in the problem.\n    # Boltzmann constant in eV/K.\n    K_B = 8.617333262e-5\n    # Conversion factor from cm^-1 to eV.\n    CM_TO_EV = 1.239841984e-4\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"T\": 300,  # Kelvin\n            \"delta_E_samples\": [0.10, 0.12, 0.08, 0.11, 0.09],  # eV\n            \"modes\": [(1500, 0.5), (300, 0.2)]  # (wavenumber cm^-1, Huang-Rhys factor S)\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 298,\n            \"delta_E_samples\": [0.20, 0.20, 0.20, 0.20],\n            \"modes\": [(1000, 0.0), (500, 0.0)]\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 310,\n            \"delta_E_samples\": [-0.05, 0.05, -0.15, 0.15, 0.00],\n            \"modes\": [(1800, 1.2)]\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 350,\n            \"delta_E_samples\": [0.30, 0.25, 0.35, 0.20],\n            \"modes\": [(1000, 0.3), (1200, 0.1), (500, 0.05)]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Extract data for the current case\n        T = case[\"T\"]\n        delta_E_samples = np.array(case[\"delta_E_samples\"])\n        modes = case[\"modes\"]\n\n        # --- Calculate Outer-Sphere Reorganization Energy (lambda_out) ---\n        # The derivation yields lambda_out = sigma_E^2 / (2 * k_B * T), where\n        # sigma_E^2 is the variance of the vertical energy gap fluctuations.\n        # The problem specifies to use the population variance (ddof=0), which is numpy's default.\n        if len(delta_E_samples)  0:\n            variance_delta_E = np.var(delta_E_samples)\n        else:\n            variance_delta_E = 0.0\n            \n        # Thermal energy term\n        k_B_T = K_B * T\n        \n        # Avoid division by zero if T=0, though not in test cases\n        if k_B_T  0:\n            lambda_out = variance_delta_E / (2 * k_B_T)\n        else:\n            lambda_out = 0.0\n\n        # --- Calculate Inner-Sphere Reorganization Energy (lambda_in) ---\n        # The derivation yields lambda_in = sum_j(S_j * h * c * nu_j), where\n        # S_j is the Huang-Rhys factor and (h*c*nu_j) is the vibrational energy quantum for mode j.\n        lambda_in = 0.0\n        for wavenumber, S_factor in modes:\n            # Convert wavenumber (cm^-1) to vibrational energy quantum (eV)\n            vibrational_energy = wavenumber * CM_TO_EV\n            # Add the mode's contribution to the total inner-sphere energy\n            lambda_in += S_factor * vibrational_energy\n\n        # --- Calculate Total Reorganization Energy (lambda) ---\n        lambda_total = lambda_out + lambda_in\n\n        # Round results to six decimal places as required\n        results_for_case = [\n            round(lambda_out, 6),\n            round(lambda_in, 6),\n            round(lambda_total, 6)\n        ]\n        all_results.append(results_for_case)\n\n    # Format the final output string exactly as specified.\n    # Example format: [[a,b,c],[d,e,f],[g,h,i],[j,k,l]]\n    result_str = str(all_results).replace(\" \", \"\")\n    print(result_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2904117"}, {"introduction": "With the fundamental parameters of an electron transfer reaction in hand—reorganization energy ($\\lambda$), driving force ($\\Delta G^\\circ$), and electronic coupling ($V$)—we can predict its speed.

It is therefore deemed **valid**. We proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe rate constant $k_{ET}$ for a nonadiabatic electron transfer process is given by Fermi's Golden Rule, adapted for a thermally equilibrated system:\n$$ k_{ET} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} |V|^2 (\\text{FCWD}) $$\nwhere $|V|$ is the magnitude of the electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor states (assumed constant under the Condon approximation), and $(\\text{FCWD})$ is the Franck-Condon weighted density of states. For a system in contact with a thermal bath, the $(\\text{FCWD})$ can be expressed as a Fourier transform of a time-correlation function:\n$$ k_{ET} = \\frac{|V|^2}{\\hbar^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dt \\, \\langle \\exp\\left(\\frac{i}{\\hbar} H_i t\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i}{\\hbar} H_f t\\right) \\rangle $$\nHere, $H_i$ and $H_f$ are the nuclear Hamiltonians for the initial (reactant) and final (product) states, and the angle brackets denote a thermal average over the initial state vibrational ensemble. This can be rewritten in terms of the energy gap $U(t) = H_f(t) - H_i(t)$:\n$$ k_{ET} = \\frac{|V|^2}{\\hbar^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dt \\, \\exp\\left(\\frac{i\\Delta G^\\circ t}{\\hbar}\\right) \\left\\langle T \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\int_0^t d\\tau \\, \\delta U(\\tau) \\right) \\right\\rangle $$\nwhere $T$ is the time-ordering operator and $\\delta U(\\tau)$ represents the fluctuations in the energy gap around its average value. The problem states that we assume a classical harmonic solvent with linear response, which implies that the energy gap fluctuations are Gaussian. By the second-order cumulant expansion theorem, the thermal average simplifies significantly. In the high-temperature classical limit, the line-shape function is given by:\n$$ G(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i\\lambda t}{\\hbar} - \\frac{\\lambda k_B T t^2}{\\hbar^2}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this into the rate expression gives:\n$$ k_{ET} = \\frac{|V|^2}{\\hbar^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dt \\, \\exp\\left(\\frac{i\\Delta G^\\circ t}{\\hbar}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i\\lambda t}{\\hbar} - \\frac{\\lambda k_B T t^2}{\\hbar^2}\\right) $$\n$$ k_{ET} = \\frac{|V|^2}{\\hbar^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dt \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda k_B T}{\\hbar^2} t^2 + \\frac{i(\\Delta G^\\circ - \\lambda)t}{\\hbar} \\right) $$\nThere appears to be a phase error in the standard derivation using this line-shape function.

It is a standard derivation in the field of theoretical chemical physics and is therefore valid. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, for an electron transfer reaction described by two diabatic free energy surfaces with different harmonic curvatures. The givens are the expressions for the reactant and product free energy surfaces, $G_{R}(Q)$ and $G_{P}(Q)$:\n$$\nG_{R}(Q) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{R} \\left(Q - Q_{R}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n$$\nG_{P}(Q) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{P} \\left(Q - Q_{P}\\right)^{2} + \\Delta G^{0}\n$$\nThe reorganization energies are defined as:\n$$\n\\lambda_{R} = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{R} \\left(Q_{P} - Q_{R}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{P} = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{P} \\left(Q_{P} - Q_{R}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nThe standard reaction free energy is $\\Delta G^{0} = G_{P}(Q_{P}) - G_{R}(Q_{R})$.\n\nThe activation free energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ is the free energy difference between the transition state and the reactant minimum. The transition state is located at the crossing point of the two diabatic surfaces, which we denote by the coordinate $Q_{c}$.\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = G_{R}(Q_{c}) - G_{R}(Q_{R})\n$$\nFrom the definition of $G_{R}(Q)$, the minimum free energy of the reactant state is $G_{R}(Q_{R}) = 0$. Therefore, the activation energy is simply the value of the free energy at the crossing point:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = G_{R}(Q_{c}) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{R} \\left(Q_{c} - Q_{R}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nAt this crossing point, the free energies of the two states are equal, $G_{R}(Q_{c}) = G_{P}(Q_{c})$.

Let us assume without loss of generality that $Q_{R}  Q_{P}$. The physically relevant crossing point must lie between the two minima, so $Q_{R}  Q_{c}  Q_{P}$.\nFrom the first expression for $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\n\\left(Q_{c} - Q_{R}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{2 \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{k_{R}} \\implies Q_{c} - Q_{R} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{k_{R}}}\n$$\nFrom the second expression for $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\n\\left(Q_{c} - Q_{P}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{2 (\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} - \\Delta G^{0})}{k_{P}} \\implies Q_{P} - Q_{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} - \\Delta G^{0})}{k_{P}}}\n$$\nThe sum of these two displacements must equal the total displacement between the minima:\n$$\n(Q_{c} - Q_{R}) + (Q_{P} - Q_{c}) = Q_{P} - Q_{R}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above yields an equation for $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{k_{R}}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} - \\Delta G^{0})}{k_{P}}} = Q_{P} - Q_{R}\n$$\nTo express this equation in terms of the given parameters $\\lambda_{R}$ and $\\lambda_{P}$, we use their definitions to replace the force constants $k_{R}$ and $k_{P}$ and the displacement $Q_{P} - Q_{R}$.\nFrom $\\lambda_{R} = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{R} (Q_{P} - Q_{R})^{2}$, we have $\\frac{1}{k_{R}} = \\frac{(Q_{P} - Q_{R})^{2}}{2 \\lambda_{R}}$.\nFrom $\\lambda_{P} = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{P} (Q_{P} - Q_{R})^{2}$, we have $\\frac{1}{k_{P}} = \\frac{(Q_{P} - Q_{R})^{2}}{2 \\lambda_{P}}$.\nSubstituting these into the equation for $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta G^{\\ddagger} (Q_{P} - Q_{R})^{2}}{2 \\lambda_{R}}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} - \\Delta G^{0}) (Q_{P} - Q_{R})^{2}}{2 \\lambda_{P}}} = Q_{P} - Q_{R}\n$$\n$$\n(Q_{P} - Q_{R}) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{\\lambda_{R}}} + (Q_{P} - Q_{R}) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} - \\Delta G^{0}}{\\lambda_{P}}} = Q_{P} - Q_{R}\n$$\nDividing by $(Q_{P} - Q_{R})$ gives a compact implicit equation for $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{\\lambda_{R}}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} - \\Delta G^{0}}{\\lambda_{P}}} = 1\n$$\nTo obtain an explicit expression, we must solve this equation for $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$.
