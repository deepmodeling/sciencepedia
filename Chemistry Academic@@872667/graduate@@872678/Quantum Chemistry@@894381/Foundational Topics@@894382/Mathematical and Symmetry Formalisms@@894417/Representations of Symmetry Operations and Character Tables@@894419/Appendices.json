Therefore, the problem is valid, and we shall proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe task is to determine the characters of the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{bond}}$, which is constructed from the four $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!H}$ bond stretching coordinates. The character of a representation for a given symmetry operation, $\\chi(g)$, is the trace of the matrix that represents the operation $g$ in the chosen basis. In this basis of bond vectors, the diagonal entries of the matrix representation of an operation $g$ are non-zero only for those basis vectors (bonds) that are mapped onto themselves by $g$. Specifically, if a bond is unshifted, its contribution to the trace is $1$; otherwise, its contribution is $0$. Consequently, the character $\\chi^{\\Gamma_{\\text{bond}}}(g)$ is simply the number of $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!H}$ bonds that remain in their original positions after the symmetry operation $g$ has been applied.\n\nMethane has a tetrahedral geometry, belonging to the $T_d$ point group. We will consider a representative operation from each of the five conjugacy classes and count the number of unshifted bonds.\n\n1.  **Identity, $E$**: The identity operation leaves all atoms and bonds unchanged.

This operation rotates the molecule by $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians ($120^\\circ$) about this axis. The single $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!H}$ bond lying on the axis of rotation is mapped onto itself. The other three $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!H}$ bonds are permuted among themselves. Therefore, only one bond is unshifted.\n    $$ \\chi^{\\Gamma_{\\text{bond}}}(C_3) = 1 $$\n\n3.  **$C_2$ rotation**: An axis of $C_2$ rotation passes through the central carbon atom and bisects two opposite $\\mathrm{H\\!-\\!C\\!-\\!H}$ bond angles. This operation rotates the molecule by $\\pi$ radians ($180^\\circ$). No bond lies on a $C_2$ axis. The operation exchanges the hydrogen atoms in pairs. Consequently, all four $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!H}$ bonds are moved to new positions. No bond is unshifted.\n    $$ \\chi^{\\Gamma_{\\text{bond}}}(C_2) = 0 $$\n\n4.  **$S_4$ improper rotation**: An axis of $S_4$ rotation is coincident with a $C_2$ axis. The operation consists of a rotation by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians ($90^\\circ$) followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to the axis and passing through the central carbon atom. This complex motion maps every hydrogen atom to a different location. As a result, no $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!H}$ bond is mapped onto itself.\n    $$ \\chi^{\\Gamma_{\\text{bond}}}(S_4) = 0 $$\n\n5.  **$\\sigma_d$ dihedral reflection**: A $\\sigma_d$ plane is a dihedral mirror plane that contains the central carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.

The dimension of $\\Gamma_{\\text{bond}}$ is $\\chi^{\\Gamma_{\\text{bond}}}(E) = 4$. The sum of the dimensions of the irreducible components is $\\dim(A_1) + \\dim(T_2) = 1 + 3 = 4$. The dimensions match.\n\nFinally, we discuss the physical interpretation of this result. The decomposition indicates that the four individual $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!H}$ bond stretching vibrations combine to form normal modes of vibration that transform according to the irreducible representations $A_1$ and $T_2$.\n- The **$A_1$ mode** is non-degenerate and transforms as the totally symmetric representation of the group. This corresponds to the **symmetric stretching vibration**, where all four $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!H}$ bonds oscillate in phase, stretching and compressing simultaneously. This mode preserves the full tetrahedral symmetry of the molecule at all points of the vibrational cycle.\n- The **$T_2$ mode** is a triply degenerate set of vibrations. These are the **asymmetric stretching vibrations**. The three modes belonging to the $T_2$ representation are energetically equivalent and can be transformed into one another by the symmetry operations of the group. In these modes, some bonds stretch while others compress in such a way that the full symmetry of the molecule is not preserved during the vibration. For example, one linear combination could involve one bond stretching while the other three compress to conserve the position of the center of mass. The three degenerate modes represent these asymmetrical oscillations along three orthogonal directions.\n\nThe problem asks for the multiplicity coefficient $n_{T_2}$.

Thus, for each of the three $\\sigma_{v}$ operations, one bond is invariant.\n    $$\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(\\sigma_{v}) = 1$$\n\nSummarizing the characters for $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$ for the classes of $D_{3h}$ $\\{E, 2C_{3}, 3C_{2}', \\sigma_{h}, 2S_{3}, 3\\sigma_{v}\\}$:\n$$\\chi^{\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}} = \\{3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1\\}$$\n\n**Part 2: Reduction of $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$**\n\nTo reduce $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$ into a direct sum of irreducible representations (irreps) of the $D_{3h}$ group, we use the reduction formula. The multiplicity $m_{i}$ of an irrep $\\Gamma_{i}$ in $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$ is given by:\n$$m_{i} = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{g} N_{g} \\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(g) \\chi_{i}(g)$$\nwhere $h$ is the order of the group ($12$), $N_{g}$ is the number of operations in class $g$, $\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(g)$ is the character of our reducible representation, and $\\chi_{i}(g)$ is the character of the irrep $\\Gamma_{i}$. We use the standard character table for $D_{3h}$.\n\nThe $D_{3h}$ character table is:\n| $D_{3h}$ | $E$ | $2C_3$ | $3C_2'$ | $\\sigma_h$ | $2S_3$ | $3\\sigma_v$ |\n| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| $A_1'$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |\n| $A_2'$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ |\n| $E'$ | $2$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $2$ | $-1$ | $0$ |\n| $A_1''$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ |\n| $A_2''$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $1$ |\n| $E''$ | $2$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $-2$ | $1$ | $0$ |\n\nNow, we calculate the multiplicities for the 'prime' irreps, as $\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(\\sigma_h) = 3$ suggests 'prime' character.\n\nMultiplicity of $A_1'$ ($m_{A_1'}$):\n$$m_{A_1'} = \\frac{1}{12} [ (1)(3)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(1)(1) + (1)(3)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(1)(1) ]$$\n$$m_{A_1'} = \\frac{1}{12} [ 3 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 0 + 3 ] = \\frac{12}{12} = 1$$\n\nMultiplicity of $E'$ ($m_{E'}$):\n$$m_{E'} = \\frac{1}{12} [ (1)(3)(2) + (2)(0)(-1) + (3)(1)(0) + (1)(3)(2) + (2)(0)(-1) + (3)(1)(0) ]$$\n$$m_{E'} = \\frac{1}{12} [ 6 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 0 ] = \\frac{12}{12} = 1$$\n\nThe total dimension of the representation must be conserved. The dimension of $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$ is $\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(E) = 3$. The sum of the dimensions of the irreps found is $m_{A_1'} \\cdot \\dim(A_1') + m_{E'} \\cdot \\dim(E') = (1)(1) + (1)(2) = 1+2=3$. This matches the dimension of $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$, so the reduction is complete.\n\nTherefore, the reducible representation for the bond stretches decomposes as:\n$$\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}} = A_1' \\oplus E'$$\n\nThe multiplicities are $m_{A_1'} = 1$ and $m_{E'} = 1$.\n\n**Part 3: Infrared Activity of Bond-Stretching Modes**\n\nA vibrational mode is infrared (IR) active if its irreducible representation has the same symmetry (transforms in the same way) as at least one of the Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, or $z$. The dipole moment vector components transform as these coordinates.\nFrom the problem statement and the $D_{3h}$ character table, the transformation properties are:\n- $(x, y)$ transform as the $E'$ irreducible representation.\n- $z$ transforms as the $A_2''$ irreducible representation.\n\nThe stretching modes we identified have symmetries $A_1'$ and $E'$. We check each for IR activity:\n\n- **$A_1'$ mode**: The $A_1'$ irrep does not match $E'$ or $A_2''$. Therefore, the $A_1'$ stretching mode is **IR-inactive**. This mode corresponds to the symmetric stretch where all three bonds elongate and compress in phase.\n\n- **$E'$ mode**: The $E'$ irrep matches the transformation property of the $(x, y)$ coordinates. Therefore, the $E'$ stretching mode is **IR-active**.\n\nThe question asks for the number of IR-active bond-stretching modes, $N_{\\text{IR-stretch}}$. The $E'$ representation is doubly degenerate, meaning it corresponds to a pair of two distinct normal modes that have the same vibrational frequency. These two modes correspond to asymmetric stretches that generate an oscillating dipole moment in the $xy$-plane. Therefore, there are two IR-active bond-stretching modes.\n\n$$N_{\\text{IR-stretch}} = 2$$\n\nTo summarize the final numerical results requested:\n- Multiplicity of $A_1'$ (or $m_{a_1'}$ in the requested format): $m_{a_1'} = 1$.\n- Multiplicity of $E'$ (or $m_{e'}$ in the requested format): $m_{e'} = 1$.\n- Total number of IR-active bond-stretch modes: $N_{\\text{IR-stretch}} = 2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2920998"}]}
