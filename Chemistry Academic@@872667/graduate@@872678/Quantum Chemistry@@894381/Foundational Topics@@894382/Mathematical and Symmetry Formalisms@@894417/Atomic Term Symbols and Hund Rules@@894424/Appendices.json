Do not include any units and do not round.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the sum of $L(L+1)$ over all allowed microstates of a $p^2$ electron configuration. The solution proceeds in three stages: first, constructing the manifold of all possible microstates consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle; second, decomposing this manifold into its constituent Russell-Saunders (LS) terms; and third, computing the required sum based on this decomposition.\n\n**Step 1: Construction of the Microstate Distribution**\n\nA $p$ electron is characterized by the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$ and the spin angular momentum quantum number $s=\\frac{1}{2}$. The possible values for the magnetic orbital quantum number are $m_l \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and for the magnetic spin quantum number are $m_s \\in \\{-\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2}\\}$. Consequently, a single $p$ subshell contains $2(2l+1) = 2(2(1)+1) = 6$ unique spin-orbitals, which can be denoted by the pair $(m_l, m_s)$.\n\nFor a $p^2$ configuration with two equivalent electrons, the Pauli exclusion principle dictates that the two electrons cannot occupy the same spin-orbital. Therefore, a valid microstate corresponds to a unique selection of two distinct spin-orbitals from the available six. The total number of such microstates is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\n\\text{Number of microstates} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15\n$$\nEach microstate is characterized by the total magnetic orbital quantum number $M_L = m_{l,1} + m_{l,2}$ and the total magnetic spin quantum number $M_S = m_{s,1} + m_{s,2}$. We now enumerate all $15$ distinct pairs of spin-orbitals $\\{(m_{l,1}, m_{s,1}), (m_{l,2}, m_{s,2})\\}$ and calculate the corresponding $(M_L, M_S)$ values. Let's denote spin-up as $\\uparrow$ ($m_s = +\\frac{1}{2}$) and spin-down as $\\downarrow$ ($m_s = -\\frac{1}{2}$).\n\n1.  $\\{(1\\uparrow), (1\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1+1=2, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (2, 0)$\n2.  $\\{(1\\uparrow), (0\\uparrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1+0=1, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=1 \\implies (1, 1)$\n3.  $\\{(1\\uparrow), (0\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1+0=1, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (1, 0)$\n4.  $\\{(1\\uparrow), (-1\\uparrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1-1=0, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=1 \\implies (0, 1)$\n5.  $\\{(1\\uparrow), (-1\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1-1=0, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (0, 0)$\n6.  $\\{(1\\downarrow), (0\\uparrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1+0=1, M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (1, 0)$\n7.  $\\{(1\\downarrow), (0\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1+0=1, M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=-1 \\implies (1, -1)$\n8.  $\\{(1\\downarrow), (-1\\uparrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1-1=0, M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (0, 0)$\n9.  $\\{(1\\downarrow), (-1\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1-1=0, M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=-1 \\implies (0, -1)$\n10. $\\{(0\\uparrow), (0\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=0+0=0, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (0, 0)$\n11. $\\{(0\\uparrow), (-1\\uparrow)\\} \\implies M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=1 \\implies (-1, 1)$\n12. $\\{(0\\uparrow), (-1\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (-1, 0)$\n13. $\\{(0\\downarrow), (-1\\uparrow)\\} \\implies M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (-1, 0)$\n14. $\\{(0\\downarrow), (-1\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=-1 \\implies (-1, -1)$\n15. $\\{(-1\\uparrow), (-1\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=-1-1=-2, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (-2, 0)$\n\nAggregating these results yields the complete microstate distribution, typically presented in a table where rows correspond to $M_L$ values and columns to $M_S$ values. The numbers in the cells represent the count of microstates for each $(M_L, M_S)$ pair.\n\n| $M_L \\setminus M_S$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $1$ |\n| :---: |:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| $2$   | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |\n| $1$   | $1$ | $2$ | $1$ |\n| $0$   | $1$ | $3$ | $1$ |\n| $-1$  | $1$ | $2$ | $1$ |\n| $-2$  | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |\n\nThe sum of all entries is $1+1+2+1+1+3+1+1+2+1+1 = 15$, which confirms our enumeration is complete.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of LS Terms**\n\nWe identify the LS terms using the highest-weight method, which involves systematically accounting for all microstates. An LS term, denoted $^{2S+1}L$, corresponds to a block of $(2L+1)(2S+1)$ microstates.\n\n1.  The highest value of $M_L$ in the table is $M_L=2$. This microstate has $M_S=0$. The highest-weight microstate is thus $(M_L, M_S) = (2, 0)$. This must be part of a term with $L = M_{L, \\text{max}} = 2$ and $S=M_{S, \\text{max for this L}} = 0$. This defines the term $^1D$ ($L=2, S=0$). A $^1D$ term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (2(2)+1)(2(0)+1) = 5 \\times 1 = 5$ microstates. These have $M_S=0$ and $M_L \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$. We subtract these $5$ microstates from our table.\n\n    Remaining microstates after removing the $^1D$ term:\n    | $M_L \\setminus M_S$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $1$ |\n    | :---: |:---:|:---:|:---:|\n    | $1$   | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |\n    | $0$   | $1$ | $2$ | $1$ |\n    | $-1$  | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |\n\n2.  In the reduced table, the highest value of $M_L$ is $M_L=1$. For this $M_L$, the highest $M_S$ value is $M_S=1$. The new highest-weight microstate is $(M_L, M_S) = (1, 1)$. This implies a term with $L=1$ and $S=1$. This defines the term $^3P$ ($L=1, S=1$). A $^3P$ term accounts for $(2(1)+1)(2(1)+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$ microstates. These correspond to all combinations of $M_L \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and $M_S \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. We subtract this $3 \\times 3$ block of microstates.\n\n    Remaining microstates after removing the $^3P$ term:\n    | $M_L \\setminus M_S$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $1$ |\n    | :---: |:---:|:---:|:---:|\n    | $0$   | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |\n\n3.  Finally, one microstate remains: $(M_L, M_S) = (0, 0)$. This must belong to a term with $L=0$ and $S=0$. This defines the term $^1S$ ($L=0, S=0$). A $^1S$ term accounts for $(2(0)+1)(2(0)+1) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$ microstate, which is exactly what remains.\n\nThus, the $15$ microstates of the $p^2$ configuration are partitioned into three LS terms: $^1D$, $^3P$, and $^1S$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of the Sum $\\Sigma$**\n\nThe problem asks for the sum $\\Sigma \\equiv \\sum_{\\text{all microstates}} L(L+1)$. Each microstate belonging to a specific LS term is an eigenstate of the squared total orbital angular momentum operator $\\hat{L}^2$ with eigenvalue $\\hbar^2 L(L+1)$. The value of $L(L+1)$ is constant for all microstates within a given term. Therefore, we can group the sum by the LS terms identified.\n\n-   For the $^1D$ term, $L=2$. There are $5$ microstates belonging to this term. The value of $L(L+1)$ is $2(2+1) = 6$. The total contribution from these microstates is $5 \\times 6 = 30$.\n-   For the $^3P$ term, $L=1$. There are $9$ microstates belonging to this term. The value of $L(L+1)$ is $1(1+1) = 2$. The total contribution from these microstates is $9 \\times 2 = 18$.\n-   For the $^1S$ term, $L=0$. There is $1$ microstate belonging to this term. The value of $L(L+1)$ is $0(0+1) = 0$. The total contribution from this microstate is $1 \\times 0 = 0$.\n\nThe total sum $\\Sigma$ is the sum of these contributions:\n$$\n\\Sigma = (5 \\times 6) + (9 \\times 2) + (1 \\times 0) = 30 + 18 + 0 = 48\n$$\n\nThe sum over all $15$ microstates of the eigenvalue of $\\hat{L}^2/\\hbar^2$ is $48$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{48}\n$$", "id": "2624402"}, {"introduction": "Term symbols are more than just labels; they encode crucial information about energy.
