This is a trivial inconsistency of coordinate labeling and does not affect the physical logic or solvability of the problem.

A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe force on a magnetic dipole $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ in a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is given by $\\mathbf{F}=\\nabla(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\cdot\\mathbf{B})$. The problem states that the magnetic field is primarily in the $z$-direction and its gradient is non-zero only in the $z$-direction. Thus, we can approximate the magnetic field as $\\mathbf{B} \\approx B_z(z)\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$. The interaction energy is $U = -\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\approx -\\mu_z B_z(z)$. The force is $\\mathbf{F}=-\\nabla U = \\nabla(\\mu_z B_z(z))$. Since $\\mu_z$ is an intrinsic property of the atom (its value is quantized and does not depend on position), we can write the force as $\\mathbf{F} = \\mu_z \\nabla B_z(z) = \\mu_z \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$. The force is entirely in the $z$-direction, with magnitude $F_z = \\mu_z \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}$. The problem gives the gradient as $\\partial_z B$, which we interpret as the constant value $\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}$.\n\nThe magnetic moment component $\\mu_z$ is related to the spin angular momentum component $S_z$. The operator relationship is $\\hat{\\mu}_z = -g_s \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\hat{S}_z$. For an electron (spin-1/2 particle), the eigenvalues of $\\hat{S}_z$ are $m_s \\hbar$, where $m_s = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. The measurable values of $\\mu_z$ are therefore the eigenvalues of $\\hat{\\mu}_z$:\n$$\n\\mu_z = -g_s \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} (m_s \\hbar) = -g_s \\mu_B m_s\n$$\nUsing the given approximation $g_s \\approx 2$, the possible values of $\\mu_z$ for the two spin states are:\n- For $m_s = +\\frac{1}{2}$ (spin \"up\"): $\\mu_{z, \\uparrow} \\approx -2 \\mu_B (\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\mu_B$.\n- For $m_s = -\\frac{1}{2}$ (spin \"down\"): $\\mu_{z, \\downarrow} \\approx -2 \\mu_B (-\\frac{1}{2}) = +\\mu_B$.\n\nThe forces on the atoms in the two spin states are oppositely directed along the $z$-axis:\n$$\nF_{z, \\uparrow} = -\\mu_B \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}\n$$\n$$\nF_{z, \\downarrow} = +\\mu_B \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}\n$$\nNow we analyze the trajectory. The atoms travel along the $x$-axis with constant speed $v$.\nInside the magnet of length $L$, the atoms are subjected to the constant force $F_z$. The time spent inside the magnet is $t_{mag} = \\frac{L}{v}$. During this time, they experience a constant acceleration in the $z$-direction, $a_z = \\frac{F_z}{m}$.\nThe vertical displacement upon exiting the magnet is given by kinematics:\n$$\nz_1 = \\frac{1}{2} a_z t_{mag}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{F_z}{m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{L}{v}\\right)^2 = \\frac{F_z L^2}{2mv^2}\n$$\nThe vertical velocity acquired upon exiting the magnet is:\n$$\nv_z = a_z t_{mag} = \\left(\\frac{F_z}{m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{L}{v}\\right) = \\frac{F_z L}{mv}\n$$\nAfter the magnet, the atoms drift freely for a distance $D$. The time taken for this drift is $t_{drift} = \\frac{D}{v}$. During this time, the vertical velocity $v_z$ is constant. The additional vertical displacement during drift is:\n$$\nz_2 = v_z t_{drift} = \\left(\\frac{F_z L}{mv}\\right) \\left(\\frac{D}{v}\\right) = \\frac{F_z L D}{mv^2}\n$$\nThe total vertical deflection on the detector screen is the sum $z_{total} = z_1 + z_2$:\n$$\nz_{total} = \\frac{F_z L^2}{2mv^2} + \\frac{F_z L D}{mv^2} = \\frac{F_z L}{mv^2} \\left(D + \\frac{L}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe deflections for the two spin states are:\n$$\nz_{\\downarrow} = \\frac{(\\mu_B \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}) L}{mv^2} \\left(D + \\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\quad (\\text{for } m_s = -1/2)\n$$\n$$\nz_{\\uparrow} = \\frac{(-\\mu_B \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}) L}{mv^2} \\left(D + \\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\quad (\\text{for } m_s = +1/2)\n$$\nThe total separation $\\Delta y$ (using the problem's notation for the final separation) between the centers of the two spots is the difference between these deflections:\n$$\n\\Delta y = z_{\\downarrow} - z_{\\uparrow} = \\frac{2 \\mu_B L}{mv^2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}\\right) \\left(D + \\frac{L}{2}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values.

The incident beam has a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $W = 0.1\\,\\text{mm}$. Assuming the spots on the detector have a similar width, the separation between their centers ($\\Delta y$) is more than four times the width of each spot ($\\Delta y / W \\approx 4.3$). This separation is substantial. A common rule of thumb for resolvability (similar to the Rayleigh criterion) suggests that if the separation is greater than the spot radius (or for a more conservative estimate, the full width), the spots are resolved. Since $0.43\\,\\text{mm} \\gg 0.1\\,\\text{mm}$, the two spots are unambiguously and clearly resolvable.

It is well-posed, with all necessary conditions specified to allow for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is not trivial as it illustrates the non-commutativity of spin operators.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe state space for a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ system is a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space. We choose the eigenbasis of the spin operator in the $z$-direction, $\\hat{S}_z$, as our standard basis. The basis vectors are $\\lvert z{+}\\rangle$ and $\\lvert z{-}\\rangle$, representing spin-up and spin-down along the $z$-axis, respectively. In matrix representation:\n$$\n\\lvert z{+}\\rangle \\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\lvert z{-}\\rangle \\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThese are the eigenstates of the $\\hat{S}_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z$ operator, where $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe state of the system is tracked through the three stages of the experiment.\n\nStage 1: After the first (SG)$_z$ analyzer.\nThe initial beam is unpolarized, meaning it is a statistical mixture of spin states. The first analyzer performs a measurement of the $z$-component of spin. The problem states that only the $\\lvert z{+}\\rangle$ component is selected. This acts as a state preparation step. The state of the atoms exiting the first apparatus is a pure state, which we denote as $\\lvert \\psi_1 \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\lvert \\psi_1 \\rangle = \\lvert z{+}\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nStage 2: After the second (SG)$_x$ analyzer.\nThe beam, in the state $\\lvert \\psi_1 \\rangle$, enters the (SG)$_x$ analyzer. This device measures the $x$-component of spin, which corresponds to the operator $\\hat{S}_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x$, where $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenstates of $\\hat{S}_x$ are found by diagonalizing $\\sigma_x$. The eigenvalues are $\\pm 1$, corresponding to spin projections $\\pm \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ along the $x$-axis. The corresponding normalized eigenvectors, $\\lvert x{+}\\rangle$ and $\\lvert x{-}\\rangle$, are:\n$$\n\\lvert x{+}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\lvert z{+}\\rangle + \\lvert z{-}\\rangle \\right) \\doteq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\lvert x{-}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\lvert z{+}\\rangle - \\lvert z{-}\\rangle \\right) \\doteq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAccording to the measurement postulate, when a measurement of $\\hat{S}_x$ is performed on the state $\\lvert \\psi_1 \\rangle = \\lvert z{+}\\rangle$, the state collapses to one of the eigenstates of $\\hat{S}_x$. The problem specifies that only the $\\lvert x{+}\\rangle$ component is selected. Therefore, the state of the beam after the second analyzer is $\\lvert \\psi_2 \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\lvert \\psi_2 \\rangle = \\lvert x{+}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nStage 3: After the final (SG)$_z$ analyzer.\nThe beam, now in state $\\lvert \\psi_2 \\rangle = \\lvert x{+}\\rangle$, enters the final (SG)$_z$ analyzer. This device measures the $z$-component of spin. The probabilities of finding the atom in the state $\\lvert z{+}\\rangle$ or $\\lvert z{-}\\rangle$ are given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of $\\lvert \\psi_2 \\rangle$ onto these respective basis states.\n\nThe probability of measuring spin-up along $z$, $p_{z+}$, is:\n$$\np_{z+} = |\\langle z{+} | \\psi_2 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle z{+} | x{+} \\rangle|^2\n$$\nThe inner product is calculated as:\n$$\n\\langle z{+} | x{+} \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThus, the probability is:\n$$\np_{z+} = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nThe probability of measuring spin-down along $z$, $p_{z-}$, is:\n$$\np_{z-} = |\\langle z{-} | \\psi_2 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle z{-} | x{+} \\rangle|^2\n$$\nThe inner product is calculated as:\n$$\n\\langle z{-} | x{+} \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThus, the probability is:\n$$\np_{z-} = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe pair of probabilities is $(p_{z+},\\,p_{z-}) = (\\frac{1}{2},\\,\\frac{1}{2})$. The total probability is $p_{z+} + p_{z-} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$, as required.\n\nExplanation for the erasure of information:\nThe erasure of the initial $z$-polarization information by the intermediate (SG)$_x$ measurement is a direct consequence of the non-commutativity of the corresponding quantum mechanical operators, $\\hat{S}_z$ and $\\hat{S}_x$. Their commutator is non-zero:\n$$\n[\\hat{S}_z, \\hat{S}_x] = \\hat{S}_z \\hat{S}_x - \\hat{S}_x \\hat{S}_z = i\\hbar\\hat{S}_y \\neq 0\n$$\nBecause the operators do not commute, they do not possess a simultaneous eigenbasis. This is the mathematical foundation of the uncertainty principle for these observables.\n\n1.  **Initial State Preparation**: The first (SG)$_z$ analyzer prepares the system in the state $\\lvert z{+}\\rangle$. This is an eigenstate of $\\hat{S}_z$. If we were to measure $\\hat{S}_z$ again immediately, we would find the spin to be up with probability $1$. The system has a definite value for the $z$-component of its spin.\n\n2.  **Intermediate Measurement**: The state $\\lvert z{+}\\rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $\\hat{S}_x$. It can be expressed as a linear superposition of the $\\hat{S}_x$ eigenstates:\n    $$\n    \\lvert z{+}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\lvert x{+}\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\lvert x{-}\\rangle\n    $$\n    The measurement by the (SG)$_x$ analyzer forces the system to collapse into one of these two eigenstates. The experimental setup selects the $\\lvert x{+}\\rangle$ outcome. At this point, the state of the system is $\\lvert x{+}\\rangle$. The system now has a definite value for the $x$-component of its spin.\n\n3.  **Loss of Information**: The new state, $\\lvert x{+}\\rangle$, is not an eigenstate of $\\hat{S}_z$. We can express it in the $\\hat{S}_z$ basis:\n    $$\n    \\lvert x{+}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\lvert z{+}\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\lvert z{-}\\rangle\n    $$\n    This expression shows that the state is an equal superposition of spin-up and spin-down along the $z$-axis. The definite knowledge that the spin was initially along the $+z$ direction (i.e., state $\\lvert z{+}\\rangle$) has been destroyed. The act of precisely measuring the spin along the $x$-axis has completely randomized the spin component along the $z$-axis. A subsequent measurement of $\\hat{S}_z$ will yield outcomes $\\lvert z{+}\\rangle$ and $\\lvert z{-}\\rangle$ with equal probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$. The intermediate measurement of an incompatible observable erases the memory of the previous state preparation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2931735"}, {"introduction": "To fully master spin measurement, one must be able to predict outcomes for any initial state and any measurement orientation.

Using the vector of Pauli operators $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = (\\hat{\\sigma}_x, \\hat{\\sigma}_y, \\hat{\\sigma}_z)$ and the relation $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{S}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$, we have:\n$$\n\\hat{S}_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}} = \\hat{S}_x n_x + \\hat{S}_y n_y + \\hat{S}_z n_z = (\\hat{S}_x \\sin\\alpha) + (\\hat{S}_y \\cdot 0) + (\\hat{S}_z \\cos\\alpha) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}(\\hat{\\sigma}_x \\sin\\alpha + \\hat{\\sigma}_z \\cos\\alpha)\n$$\nIn the $z$-basis, the Pauli matrices are:\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\hat{\\sigma}_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the matrix representation of the operator $\\hat{S}_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}}$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{S}_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}} \\doteq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\alpha + \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\alpha \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\alpha  \\sin\\alpha \\\\ \\sin\\alpha  -\\cos\\alpha \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe outcomes of the measurement correspond to the eigenvalues of this operator, which for any spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ component are $+\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ and $-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The post-measurement states are the corresponding eigenvectors, denoted $|\\uparrow_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}}\\rangle$ and $|\\downarrow_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}}\\rangle$.\n\nTo find the eigenvector $|\\uparrow_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}}\\rangle$ for the eigenvalue $+\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\alpha  \\sin\\alpha \\\\ \\sin\\alpha  -\\cos\\alpha \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives the system of linear equations:\n$$\na\\cos\\alpha + b\\sin\\alpha = a \\implies b\\sin\\alpha = a(1-\\cos\\alpha)\n$$\nUsing the half-angle identities $\\sin\\alpha = 2\\sin(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})$ and $1-\\cos\\alpha = 2\\sin^2(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})$, we get:\n$$\nb\\left(2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\right) = a\\left(2\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nFor $\\sin(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}) \\neq 0$, this simplifies to $b\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}) = a\\sin(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})$, or $b/a = \\tan(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})$.\nThe unnormalized eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\alpha/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. Normalizing this vector gives:\n$$\n|\\uparrow_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}}\\rangle \\doteq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\tan^2(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}) \\\\ \\sin(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIn ket notation, this is $|\\uparrow_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}}\\rangle = \\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})|\\uparrow_z\\rangle + \\sin(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})|\\downarrow_z\\rangle$.\n\nThe eigenvector $|\\downarrow_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}}\\rangle$ for the eigenvalue $-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ must be orthogonal to $|\\uparrow_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}}\\rangle$. A valid choice satisfying this condition is:\n$$\n|\\downarrow_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}}\\rangle \\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} \\sin(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}) \\\\ -\\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIn ket notation, this is $|\\downarrow_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}}\\rangle = \\sin(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})|\\uparrow_z\\rangle - \\cos(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})|\\downarrow_z\\rangle$.\n\nNow we calculate the probabilities $P_+$ and $P_-$.\nThe probability of obtaining the outcome $+\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (state $|\\uparrow_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}}\\rangle$) is $P_+ = |\\langle \\uparrow_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}} | \\psi \\rangle|^2$. The inner product is:\n$$\n\\langle \\uparrow_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}} | \\psi \\rangle = \\left( \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\quad \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\\\ \\exp(i\\phi)\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + \\exp(i\\phi)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe probability $P_+$ is the squared modulus of this complex number:\n$$\nP_+ = \\left|\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + \\exp(i\\phi)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right|^2\n$$\n$$\nP_+ = \\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + \\cos\\phi\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\sin\\phi\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nP_+ = \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + 2\\cos\\phi\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + \\cos^2\\phi\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + \\sin^2\\phi\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nP_+ = \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + 2\\cos\\phi\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the identities $\\cos^2(x) = \\frac{1+\\cos(2x)}{2}$, $\\sin^2(x) = \\frac{1-\\cos(2x)}{2}$, and $\\sin(2x) = 2\\sin(x)\\cos(x)$:\n$$\nP_+ = \\left(\\frac{1+\\cos\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1+\\cos\\theta}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1-\\cos\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1-\\cos\\theta}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\alpha\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi\n$$\n$$\nP_+ = \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\cos\\alpha+\\cos\\theta+\\cos\\alpha\\cos\\theta) + \\frac{1}{4}(1-\\cos\\alpha-\\cos\\theta+\\cos\\alpha\\cos\\theta) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\alpha\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi\n$$\n$$\nP_+ = \\frac{1}{4}(2 + 2\\cos\\alpha\\cos\\theta) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\alpha\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi\n$$\n$$\nP_+ = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos\\alpha\\cos\\theta + \\sin\\alpha\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi)\n$$\n\nFor the probability $P_-$ of obtaining the outcome $-\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (state $|\\downarrow_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}}\\rangle$), we can use the fact that probabilities must sum to unity: $P_- = 1 - P_+$.\n$$\nP_- = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos\\alpha\\cos\\theta + \\sin\\alpha\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi)\n$$\n$$\nP_- = \\frac{1}{2}(2 - 1 - \\cos\\alpha\\cos\\theta - \\sin\\alpha\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi)\n$$\n$$\nP_- = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos\\alpha\\cos\\theta - \\sin\\alpha\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi)\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.
