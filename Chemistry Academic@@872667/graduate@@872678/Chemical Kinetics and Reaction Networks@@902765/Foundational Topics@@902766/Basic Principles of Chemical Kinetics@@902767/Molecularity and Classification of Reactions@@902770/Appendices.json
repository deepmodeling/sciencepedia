The assumptions are clearly stated and lead to a unique, meaningful solution. There are no contradictions, missing data, or factual inaccuracies. The problem is valid. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Macroscopic Rate Law**\n\nWe begin with the stochastic description of the reaction. We are given that a single molecule of species $\\text{A}$ has a constant probability per unit time, or hazard, $k$ of converting to products. The process is Markovian, meaning the future evolution of the system depends only on its present state, not on its past history. The decay events of individual molecules are independent.\n\nLet $N_{\\text{A}}(t)$ be the number of molecules of species $\\text{A}$ in the volume $V$ at time $t$. The total hazard for any one of the $N_{\\text{A}}(t)$ molecules to react in the next infinitesimal time interval $dt$ is the sum of the individual hazards. Due to independence, this is the product of the hazard per molecule, $k$, and the number of molecules, $N_{\\text{A}}(t)$. This quantity is the reaction propensity, $a(N_{\\text{A}})$.\n$$a(N_{\\text{A}}) = k N_{\\text{A}}(t)$$\nThe probability of a single reaction event occurring in the time interval $[t, t+dt)$ is given by $a(N_{\\text{A}}) dt = k N_{\\text{A}}(t) dt$. Each reaction event decreases the number of $\\text{A}$ molecules by one, so $\\Delta N_{\\text{A}} = -1$.\n\nWe are interested in the evolution of the average number of molecules, $\\langle N_{\\text{A}}(t) \\rangle$, where the average is taken over an ensemble of identical systems. The expected change in the number of molecules, $d\\langle N_{\\text{A}}(t) \\rangle$, during the interval $dt$ is the change per event multiplied by the probability of the event occurring:\n$$d\\langle N_{\\text{A}}(t) \\rangle = (\\Delta N_{\\text{A}}) \\times (\\text{Probability of event})$$\n$$d\\langle N_{\\text{A}}(t) \\rangle = (-1) \\times (k \\langle N_{\\text{A}}(t) \\rangle dt)$$\nHere, we have replaced $N_{\\text{A}}(t)$ inside the propensity with its expectation value $\\langle N_{\\text{A}}(t) \\rangle$. This is exact for first-order reactions. Dividing by $dt$, we obtain a differential equation for the time evolution of the ensemble average number of molecules:\n$$\\frac{d\\langle N_{\\text{A}}(t) \\rangle}{dt} = -k \\langle N_{\\text{A}}(t) \\rangle$$\nThe problem requires us to pass to the macroscopic limit. In this limit, where the number of molecules is very large (approaching the thermodynamic limit), the law of large numbers ensures that the relative fluctuations around the mean become negligible. The macroscopic, deterministic observable quantity, which we may denote as $N_{\\text{A,det}}(t)$, can be identified with the ensemble average $\\langle N_{\\text{A}}(t) \\rangle$.\n$$N_{\\text{A,det}}(t) \\approx \\langle N_{\\text{A}}(t) \\rangle$$\nSubstituting this into the differential equation for the mean, we get the deterministic rate equation for the number of molecules:\n$$\\frac{dN_{\\text{A,det}}(t)}{dt} = -k N_{\\text{A,det}}(t)$$\nThe problem uses the quantity $[\\text{A}](t)$, defined as the number density, $[\\text{A}](t) = N_{\\text{A}}(t)/V$. Since the volume $V$ is constant (isochoric reactor), we can divide the entire equation by $V$:\n$$\\frac{1}{V} \\frac{dN_{\\text{A,det}}(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{k}{V} N_{\\text{A,det}}(t)$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{N_{\\text{A,det}}(t)}{V}\\right) = -k \\left(\\frac{N_{\\text{A,det}}(t)}{V}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the definition of $[\\text{A}](t)$, we arrive at the macroscopic rate law:\n$$\\frac{d[\\text{A}](t)}{dt} = -k [\\text{A}](t)$$\nThis is equivalent to the form requested in the problem, $-\\frac{d[\\text{A}]}{dt} = k[\\text{A}]$. This completes the derivation.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Time for 90% Conversion**\n\nWe must solve the first-order ordinary differential equation derived above:\n$$\\frac{d[\\text{A}]}{dt} = -k[\\text{A}]$$\nwith the initial condition $[\\text{A}] = [\\text{A}]_0$ at $t=0$. This is a separable equation.\n$$\\frac{d[\\text{A}]}{[\\text{A}]} = -k dt$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state $(t=0, [\\text{A}]=[\\text{A}]_0)$ to a state at time $t$ where the concentration is $[\\text{A}](t)$:\n$$\\int_{[\\text{A}]_0}^{[\\text{A}](t)} \\frac{1}{[\\text{A}]'} d[\\text{A}]' = \\int_0^t -k dt'$$\n$$\\ln([\\text{A}](t)) - \\ln([\\text{A}]_0) = -kt$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}](t)}{[\\text{A}]_0}\\right) = -kt$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction:\n$$[\\text{A}](t) = [\\text{A}]_0 \\exp(-kt)$$\nThe fractional conversion, $X$, is defined as the fraction of the initial reactant that has been consumed.\n$$X = \\frac{[\\text{A}]_0 - [\\text{A}](t)}{[\\text{A}]_0} = 1 - \\frac{[\\text{A}](t)}{[\\text{A}]_0}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the ratio $[\\text{A}](t)/[\\text{A}]_0$ from the integrated rate law:\n$$X = 1 - \\exp(-kt)$$\nWe need to find the time $t$ required to reach a conversion of $X = 0.90$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $t$:\n$$\\exp(-kt) = 1 - X$$\n$$-kt = \\ln(1 - X)$$\n$$t = -\\frac{1}{k} \\ln(1 - X) = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1-X}\\right)$$\nThe problem provides the values $k = 0.10\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ and $X = 0.90$.

The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and provides consistent, non-contradictory data sufficient for a unique solution. It does not violate any fundamental laws, is free of ambiguity, and represents a standard, non-trivial exercise in physical chemistry. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine the apparent overall order of reaction, $\\alpha$, for the process $\\text{A} + \\text{B} \\to \\text{P}$. The initial rate, $r_0$, is given to follow the empirical power-law expression:\n$$r_0 = k\\,[\\text{A}]^{m}[\\text{B}]^{n}$$\nwhere $m$ and $n$ are the apparent orders with respect to reactants $\\text{A}$ and $\\text{B}$, respectively, and $k$ is the rate coefficient. The overall order is defined as $\\alpha = m + n$.\n\nTo determine the orders $m$ and $n$ from the provided experimental data, we employ a log-log analysis. This is achieved by taking the natural logarithm of the rate law equation:\n$$\\ln(r_0) = \\ln(k) + m\\ln([\\text{A}]) + n\\ln([\\text{B}])$$\nThis transformation linearizes the relationship between the rate and the concentrations, allowing the orders $m$ and $n$ to be determined as slopes of straight lines.\n\nFirst, we determine the order $m$ with respect to reactant $\\text{A}$. We utilize the first set of experiments where the concentration of $\\text{B}$ is held constant at $[\\text{B}]=0.1600\\,\\text{M}$. Under this condition, the term $n\\ln([\\text{B}])$ is constant. The rate law simplifies to:\n$$\\ln(r_0) = \\left( \\ln(k) + n\\ln(0.1600) \\right) + m\\ln([\\text{A}])$$\nThis equation has the form $y = C + mx$, where $y = \\ln(r_0)$, $x = \\ln([\\text{A}])$, and the slope is the reaction order $m$. We can calculate this slope using any two data points from the first set. Let us use the first two experiments:\n- Experiment 1: $[\\text{A}]_1=0.0400\\,\\text{M}$, $r_{0,1}=0.0032\\,\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- Experiment 2: $[\\text{A}]_2=0.1600\\,\\text{M}$, $r_{0,2}=0.0256\\,\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe slope $m$ is given by:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta(\\ln(r_0))}{\\Delta(\\ln([\\text{A}]))} = \\frac{\\ln(r_{0,2}) - \\ln(r_{0,1})}{\\ln([\\text{A}]_2) - \\ln([\\text{A}]_1)} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{0,2}}{r_{0,1}}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}]_2}{[\\text{A}]_1}\\right)}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$m = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.0256}{0.0032}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.1600}{0.0400}\\right)} = \\frac{\\ln(8)}{\\ln(4)} = \\frac{\\ln(2^3)}{\\ln(2^2)} = \\frac{3\\ln(2)}{2\\ln(2)} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\nThus, the apparent order with respect to $\\text{A}$ is $m = 1.5$.\n\nNext, we determine the order $n$ with respect to reactant $\\text{B}$. We use the second set of experiments where the concentration of $\\text{A}$ is held constant at $[\\text{A}]=0.1600\\,\\text{M}$. The logarithmic form of the rate law becomes:\n$$\\ln(r_0) = \\left( \\ln(k) + m\\ln(0.1600) \\right) + n\\ln([\\text{B}])$$\nThis is an equation of the form $y = C' + nx$, where $y = \\ln(r_0)$, $x = \\ln([\\text{B}])$, and the slope is the reaction order $n$. We select two data points from the second set:\n- Experiment 3: $[\\text{B}]_1=0.0400\\,\\text{M}$, $r_{0,3}=0.0128\\,\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- Experiment 4: $[\\text{B}]_2=0.1600\\,\\text{M}$, $r_{0,4}=0.0256\\,\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe slope $n$ is given by:\n$$n = \\frac{\\Delta(\\ln(r_0))}{\\Delta(\\ln([\\text{B}]))} = \\frac{\\ln(r_{0,4}) - \\ln(r_{0,3})}{\\ln([\\text{B}]_2) - \\ln([\\text{B}]_1)} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{0,4}}{r_{0,3}}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{B}]_2}{[\\text{B}]_1}\\right)}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$n = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.0256}{0.0128}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.1600}{0.0400}\\right)} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(4)} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(2^2)} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{2\\ln(2)} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThus, the apparent order with respect to $\\text{B}$ is $n = 0.5$.\n\nThe apparent overall reaction order, $\\alpha$, is the sum of the individual orders:\n$$\\alpha = m + n = 1.5 + 0.5 = 2$$\n\nThe problem also requires an explanation for why these apparent orders need not equal the stoichiometric coefficients from the overall equation $\\text{A} + \\text{B} \\to \\text{P}$. The stoichiometric coefficients for both $\\text{A}$ and $\\text{B}$ are $1$. Our calculated orders are $m=1.5$ and $n=0.5$. The discrepancy is fundamental to chemical kinetics.\n\nThe concepts of molecularity and reaction order are distinct. Molecularity is a theoretical construct that applies only to elementary reactions, which are single-step processes occurring at the molecular level. For an elementary reaction, the rate law can be written directly from its stoichiometry. If the reaction $\\text{A} + \\text{B} \\to \\text{P}$ were an elementary step, its rate law would be $r = k[\\text{A}]^1[\\text{B}]^1$, and the orders would indeed be $m=1$ and $n=1$.\n\nHowever, most chemical reactions, including the one under consideration, are not elementary. They are complex reactions that proceed through a sequence of multiple elementary steps, collectively known as the reaction mechanism. The experimentally observed rate law (and thus the apparent orders $m$ and $n$) is a mathematical expression that describes the net rate of the overall transformation. This expression is a function of the rate constants of the individual elementary steps and often involves concentrations of short-lived reaction intermediates.\n\nThe functional form of the overall rate law is derived by analyzing the mechanism, typically using approximations such as the steady-state approximation for intermediates or the pre-equilibrium approximation for fast, reversible steps. Such derivations frequently lead to rate laws with complex, fractional, or even negative orders that bear no simple relationship to the stoichiometric coefficients of the overall balanced equation.\n\nIn this case, the determined orders $m=1.5$ and $n=0.5$ are fractional. The existence of fractional orders is irrefutable evidence that the reaction is not elementary but proceeds through a multi-step mechanism. The specific values of $m$ and $n$ are determined by the particular sequence of elementary steps and their relative rates. For instance, half-integer orders often arise in mechanisms involving pre-equilibrium dissociation of a dimer or in free-radical chain reactions. The apparent orders are empirical quantities reflecting the complexity of the underlying mechanism, whereas stoichiometric coefficients merely represent the overall mass balance of the reaction.\n\nIn summary, the apparent reaction orders ($m, n$) are experimentally determined parameters of the empirical rate law, while molecularity and stoichiometric coefficients are theoretical concepts related to the elementary steps and overall material balance, respectively. For a complex reaction, there is no a priori reason for the experimental orders to equal the stoichiometric coefficients. Our analysis confirms this principle.\n\nThe final calculation for the overall reaction order is:\n$$\\alpha = m + n = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2657347"}, {"introduction": "When an experimentally determined rate law does not match the overall reaction stoichiometry, the work of a kineticist begins.

Substituting this expression for $[\\text{A}_2]$ into the rate equation for the RDS:\n$$ r = k_2 \\left( \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}[\\text{A}]^2 \\right) [\\text{B}] = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[\\text{A}]^2[\\text{B}] $$\nThis derived rate law has the form $k_{\\text{eff}}[\\text{A}]^2[\\text{B}]$, with $k_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}$. This is consistent with the observed rate law.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Pre-equilibrium complex formation followed by unimolecular decay:**\nThe mechanism is:\n$$ \\text{A}+\\text{B}\\ \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_{1}}{\\rightleftharpoons}}\\ \\text{I} \\quad (\\text{fast, QE}) $$\n$$ \\text{I}\\ \\xrightarrow{k_{2}}\\ \\text{P} \\quad (\\text{slow, RDS}) $$\nThe overall rate is determined by the RDS, the unimolecular decay of intermediate $\\text{I}$.\n$$ r = k_2[\\text{I}] $$\nApplying the QE approximation to the first step to find $[\\text{I}]$:\n$$ k_1[\\text{A}][\\text{B}] = k_{-1}[\\text{I}] $$\n$$ [\\text{I}] = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}[\\text{A}][\\text{B}] = K_{\\text{eq},1}[\\text{A}][\\text{B}] $$\nSubstituting this into the rate equation:\n$$ r = k_2 \\left( \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}[\\text{A}][\\text{B}] \\right) = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[\\text{A}][\\text{B}] $$\nThis derived rate law is second order overall (first order in $[\\text{A}]$ and first order in $[\\text{B}]$). It does not match the experimentally observed third-order rate law, $r_{\\text{obs}} \\propto [\\text{A}]^2[\\text{B}]$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Stepwise formation and consumption of an intermediate under steady state:**\nThe mechanism is:\n$$ \\text{A}\\ \\xrightarrow{k_{1}}\\ \\text{X} \\quad (\\text{slow, RDS}) $$\n$$ \\text{X}+\\text{A}\\ \\xrightarrow{k_{2}}\\ \\text{Y} \\quad (\\text{fast}) $$\n$$ \\text{Y}+\\text{B}\\ \\xrightarrow{k_{3}}\\ \\text{P} \\quad (\\text{fast}) $$\nIn a mechanism with a designated slow rate-determining step that occurs before any fast steps (a \"pre-RDS\" mechanism), the overall rate of reaction is simply the rate of that initial slow step. The subsequent fast steps consume the intermediates as they are formed, but they do not affect the overall rate.\nTherefore, the rate is determined by the first step:\n$$ r = k_1[\\text{A}] $$\nThis derived rate law is first order in $[\\text{A}]$ and zeroth order in $[\\text{B}]$. It does not match the observed third-order rate law.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Consecutive pre-equilibria leading to a unimolecular rate-limiting step:**\nThe mechanism is:\n$$ \\text{A}+\\text{A}\\ \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_{1}}{\\rightleftharpoons}}\\ \\text{A}_2 \\quad (\\text{fast, QE}) $$\n$$ \\text{A}_2+\\text{B}\\ \\underset{k_{-2}}{\\stackrel{k_{2}}{\\rightleftharpoons}}\\ \\text{J} \\quad (\\text{fast, QE}) $$\n$$ \\text{J}\\ \\xrightarrow{k_{3}}\\ \\text{P} \\quad (\\text{slow, RDS}) $$\nThe overall rate is given by the RDS, which is the third step.\n$$ r = k_3[\\text{J}] $$\nThe concentration of intermediate $\\text{J}$ is found by applying the QE approximation to the second step:\n$$ k_2[\\text{A}_2][\\text{B}] = k_{-2}[\\text{J}] $$\n$$ [\\text{J}] = \\frac{k_2}{k_{-2}}[\\text{A}_2][\\text{B}] = K_{\\text{eq},2}[\\text{A}_2][\\text{B}] $$\nThe concentration of intermediate $\\text{A}_2$ is found by applying the QE approximation to the first step:\n$$ k_1[\\text{A}]^2 = k_{-1}[\\text{A}_2] $$\n$$ [\\text{A}_2] = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}[\\text{A}]^2 = K_{\\text{eq},1}[\\text{A}]^2 $$\nNow, substitute the expression for $[\\text{A}_2]$ into the expression for $[\\text{J}]$:\n$$ [\\text{J}] = \\frac{k_2}{k_{-2}} \\left( \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}[\\text{A}]^2 \\right) [\\text{B}] = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}k_{-2}}[\\text{A}]^2[\\text{B}] $$\nFinally, substitute this complete expression for $[\\text{J}]$ into the rate law for the RDS:\n$$ r = k_3 \\left( \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}k_{-2}}[\\text{A}]^2[\\text{B}] \\right) = \\frac{k_1 k_2 k_3}{k_{-1}k_{-2}}[\\text{A}]^2[\\text{B}] $$\nThis derived rate law has the form $k_{\\text{eff}}[\\text{A}]^2[\\text{B}]$, with $k_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{k_1 k_2 k_3}{k_{-1}k_{-2}}$. This is consistent with the observed rate law.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nIn summary, mechanisms A, B, and E all produce a rate law that is kinetically indistinguishable from the observed rate law under the specified approximations. These three mechanisms exemplify that an identical overall rate law can arise from different sequences and molecularities of elementary steps: a single termolecular step (A), a fast bimolecular pre-equilibrium followed by a slow bimolecular step (B), and two fast pre-equilibria followed by a slow unimolecular step (E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2657375"}]}
