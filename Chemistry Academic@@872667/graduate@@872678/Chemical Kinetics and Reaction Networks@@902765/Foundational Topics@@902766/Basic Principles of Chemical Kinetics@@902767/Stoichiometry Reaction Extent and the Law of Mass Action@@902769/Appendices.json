We begin by formally constructing the stoichiometric matrix.\n\nThe system involves $m=4$ chemical species, which are ordered as $(A, B, C, D)$, and $r=3$ reactions. The stoichiometric matrix $N$ is an $m \\times r$ matrix, where the element $N_{ij}$ represents the net stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ in reaction $j$.

The rank of a matrix is defined as the dimension of the vector space spanned by its columns (or rows), which is equivalent to the maximum number of linearly independent columns (or rows).

This means that the $3$ given reactions are independent; no reaction can be represented as a linear combination of the other two. The set of all possible changes in species concentrations due to reaction is confined to a $3$-dimensional subspace (the stoichiometric subspace) within the $4$-dimensional space of species concentrations.\n\nThe number of independent linear conservation relations, denoted by $s$, is given by the rank-nullity theorem applied to the stoichiometric matrix.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe rate of change for the concentration of each species is the sum of the rates of production and consumption from all reactions in the network. The general form of the rate equation for a species $i$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dc_i}{dt} = \\sum_{j=1}^{R} \\nu_{ij} v_j $$\nwhere $R$ is the total number of reactions, $v_j$ is the rate of the $j$-th reaction, and $\\nu_{ij}$ is the stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ in reaction $j$. Reactants have negative coefficients, and products have positive coefficients. This system can be expressed in matrix form as $\\dot{c} = N\\,v(c)$, where $\\dot{c}$ is the vector of time derivatives of concentrations, $N$ is the stoichiometric matrix whose elements are $\\nu_{ij}$, and $v(c)$ is the vector of reaction rates $v_j$.\n\nThe species are ordered as $A$, $B$, $C$. The reactions are ordered as given: ($1$) $2A + B \\to C$ and ($2$) $C \\to A + B$.\n\nFirst, we determine the reaction rate vector $v(c)$.

The system is a closed, well-mixed, isothermal, isochoric batch reactor.\n\nFirst, we derive the autonomous ordinary differential equation for the concentration vector $c(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} c_{A}(t) \\\\ c_{B}(t) \\end{pmatrix}$. According to the Law of Mass Action, the rate of the forward reaction is $r_1 = k_1 c_A(t)$ and the rate of the reverse reaction is $r_{-1} = k_{-1} c_B(t)$. The net rate of change for each species is determined by its stoichiometric participation in these reactions.\nThe concentration of species $A$ decreases due to the forward reaction and increases due to the reverse reaction:\n$$ \\frac{dc_A}{dt} = -r_1 + r_{-1} = -k_1 c_A + k_{-1} c_B $$\nConversely, the concentration of species $B$ increases due to the forward reaction and decreases due to the reverse reaction:\n$$ \\frac{dc_B}{dt} = +r_1 - r_{-1} = k_1 c_A - k_{-1} c_B $$\nThese two equations form a system of linear, autonomous ordinary differential equations. In vector form, this is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\begin{pmatrix} c_A \\\\ c_B \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -k_1 c_A + k_{-1} c_B \\\\ k_1 c_A - k_{-1} c_B \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis can be written as a linear system $\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{c}}{dt} = F(\\boldsymbol{c}) = J \\boldsymbol{c}$, where the constant matrix $J$ is:\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} -k_1  k_{-1} \\\\ k_1  -k_{-1} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nSecond, we identify the condition for an interior equilibrium $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_{A}^{\\ast} \\\\ c_{B}^{\\ast} \\end{pmatrix}$. At equilibrium, the concentrations do not change with time, so $\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{c}}{dt} = \\boldsymbol{0}$.

Summing the two rate equations gives $\\frac{d(c_A + c_B)}{dt} = 0$, which implies $c_A(t) + c_B(t) = C_{total}$, a constant. This conservation law constrains the dynamics to a line segment in the concentration space. A zero eigenvalue indicates a direction in state space along which the system does not evolve—it is a \"slow mode\" with an infinite time scale. This mode corresponds to the existence of a continuum of equilibrium states (the line $k_1 c_A = k_{-1} c_B$), from which a specific equilibrium point is selected by the value of the conserved quantity $C_{total}$. This is the \"conservation mode\" dictated by stoichiometry.\n\nThe eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -(k_1 + k_{-1})$ is strictly negative, as $k_1  0$ and $k_{-1}  0$. This eigenvalue corresponds to a stable \"fast mode\" of the system. It governs the exponential relaxation of the system towards the equilibrium manifold. The corresponding eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is the direction of the reaction stoichiometry ($A \\rightarrow B$ leads to a decrease in $A$ and an increase in $B$). Any perturbation from equilibrium along this stoichiometric direction decays with a characteristic rate constant $|\\lambda_2| = k_1 + k_{-1}$. The reciprocal of this value, $\\tau_{relax} = (k_1 + k_{-1})^{-1}$, is the relaxation time of the chemical reaction. This eigenvalue represents the \"relaxation mode\" inherent to the kinetics described by the Law of Mass Action. The units of $k_1$ and $k_{-1}$ are $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for a first-order reaction, so the eigenvalues correctly have units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0  -(k_1 + k_{-1}) \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2679285"}]}
