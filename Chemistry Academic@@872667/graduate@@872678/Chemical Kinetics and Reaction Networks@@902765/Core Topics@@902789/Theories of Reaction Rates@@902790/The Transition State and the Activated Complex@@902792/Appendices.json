Assume the system is prepared in the canonical ensemble at temperature $T$ and that the probability of initial conditions is sampled from the stationary canonical phase-space density. The dividing surface for Transition State Theory (TST) is a surface of constant $x$. The exact rate constant differs from the TST value by the transmission coefficient $\\kappa$, which, in the reactive-flux formalism, is the fraction of the instantaneous positive flux through the dividing surface that commits to products without ever returning.\n\nYou are given the following model potential $U(x)$, designed to exhibit significant recrossing when the dividing surface is placed at the saddle at $x=0$. The potential satisfies $U(0)=0$ and has, for $x>0$, a shallow well followed by an outer barrier at $x=a>0$ of height $\\Delta U_{\\text{out}}>0$ relative to $U(0)$; for $x>a$, $U(x)$ decreases monotonically toward products. For $x0$, $U(x)$ increases monotonically toward reactants. The detailed shape between $x=0$ and $x=a$ is irrelevant; only the energetic ordering $U(a)-U(0)=\\Delta U_{\\text{out}}>0$ and monotonicity for $x>a$ matter. Assume purely Hamiltonian dynamics after crossing the dividing surface (no friction or noise), so that total energy is conserved. Denote $\\beta=\\frac{1}{k_{B} T}$ with $k_{B}$ the Boltzmann constant.\n\nBy the definition of flux in the canonical ensemble, the instantaneous positive flux density through a dividing surface at position $x=x^{\\ddagger}$ is weighted by the factor $v\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\beta \\frac{1}{2}m v^{2}\\right)$ over positive velocities $v>0$ at that surface.

Here, $v$ is the velocity, $m$ is the mass, and $\\beta = (k_B T)^{-1}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nFirst, we consider the dividing surface at $x^{\\ddagger} = 0$.\nThe total positive flux, $J_{\\text{total}}^{+}(0)$, is the integral over all possible positive velocities.\n$$ J_{\\text{total}}^{+}(0) = C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\frac{1}{2} m v^2\\right) dv $$\nwhere $C$ is a proportionality constant that will cancel in the final ratio.\nTo evaluate this integral, let us perform a substitution. Let $u = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2$. Then $du = m v dv$, which implies $v dv = \\frac{1}{m} du$. The integration limits for $u$ are from $u(v=0)=0$ to $u(v \\to \\infty) \\to \\infty$.\n$$ J_{\\text{total}}^{+}(0) = C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{m} \\exp(-\\beta u) du = \\frac{C}{m} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\exp(-\\beta u) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\frac{C}{m} \\left( 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{C}{m\\beta} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the reactive flux, $J_{\\text{reactive}}^{+}(0)$. A trajectory is reactive if and only if it surmounts the outer barrier at $x=a$. The total energy of a particle at $x=0$ with velocity $v$ is $E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 + U(0)$. Since $U(0)=0$, $E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2$. To pass the outer barrier, this energy must be at least the potential energy at the barrier maximum, $U(a) = \\Delta U_{\\text{out}}$. Thus, the condition for a reactive trajectory is $\\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\ge \\Delta U_{\\text{out}}$. This is equivalent to $v \\ge \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta U_{\\text{out}}}{m}}$.\nThe reactive flux is therefore the integral over velocities satisfying this condition.\n$$ J_{\\text{reactive}}^{+}(0) = C \\int_{\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta U_{\\text{out}}}{m}}}^{\\infty} v \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\frac{1}{2} m v^2\\right) dv $$\nUsing the same substitution $u = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2$, the lower limit of integration becomes $u(v=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\Delta U_{\\text{out}}}{m}})=\\Delta U_{\\text{out}}$.

This is the central concept of Variational Transition State Theory (VTST), which seeks the dividing surface that minimizes the calculated rate, thereby maximizing the transmission coefficient.\nThe dividing surface is now at $x^{\\ddagger} = a$. According to the problem description, for $x>a$, the potential $U(x)$ decreases monotonically. Consider a trajectory crossing the dividing surface at $x=a$ with any positive velocity $v>0$. Its total energy is $E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 + U(a)$. As the particle moves to positions $x' > a$, its potential energy $U(x')$ will be less than $U(a)$. By conservation of energy, its kinetic energy, $E - U(x')$, must be greater than $\\frac{1}{2} m v^2$ and therefore strictly positive. A positive kinetic energy means the particle's velocity never becomes zero, and thus it can never turn around and recross the dividing surface at $x=a$ from the product side.\nConsequently, every trajectory that crosses the dividing surface at $x=a$ with a positive velocity is a reactive trajectory. It commits to products without returning.\nThis means that the set of velocities contributing to the reactive flux is identical to the set of velocities contributing to the total positive flux, namely all $v>0$.\nTherefore, the reactive flux is equal to the total positive flux:\n$$ J_{\\text{reactive}}^{+}(a) = J_{\\text{total}}^{+}(a) = C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\frac{1}{2} m v^2\\right) dv $$\nThe transmission coefficient $\\kappa(a)$ is their ratio:\n$$ \\kappa(a) = \\frac{J_{\\text{reactive}}^{+}(a)}{J_{\\text{total}}^{+}(a)} = 1 $$\nThis is the ideal value for a transmission coefficient, indicating that the dividing surface at $x=a$ is the optimal choice for this model, as it eliminates all recrossing events. The specific value of $\\Delta U_{\\text{out}}$ calculated previously does not alter this result, as the conclusion holds for any $\\Delta U_{\\text{out}} > 0$.\n\nThe question asks for the numerical value of $\\kappa(a)$ rounded to three significant figures.

The TST rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{TST}}$ is proportional to the barrier frequency $\\omega^{\\ddagger}$. The true rate is proportional to an effective, friction-dependent crossing frequency. The transmission coefficient $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{GH}}$ is the ratio of this effective frequency to the bare barrier frequency.\n\nTo find this effective frequency, we analyze the deterministic part of the Langevin equation by setting the stochastic force $\\xi(t)$ to zero:\n$$\\ddot{x}(t) + \\gamma \\dot{x}(t) - \\left(\\omega^{\\ddagger}\\right)^{2} x(t) = 0$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.

The Grote-Hynes effective reactive frequency is precisely this unstable eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{1}$.\n\nThe transmission coefficient $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{GH}}$ is defined as the ratio of the reactive frequency $\\lambda_{1}$ to the bare barrier frequency $\\omega^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\\kappa_{\\mathrm{GH}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{\\omega^{\\ddagger}} = \\frac{1}{\\omega^{\\ddagger}} \\left( \\frac{-\\gamma + \\sqrt{\\gamma^{2} + 4\\left(\\omega^{\\ddagger}\\right)^{2}}}{2} \\right)$$\nThis expression can be rearranged into a more compact form.

This recovers the celebrated result for the spatial diffusion limit of Kramers' theory, where the reaction becomes limited by the slow diffusion over the barrier.\n\nWe have derived the Grote-Hynes transmission coefficient and its limiting behaviors for low and high friction, which conform to the expected results from TST and Kramers' theory, respectively.

It is convenient to set the lower integration limit to $-a$:\n$$\nq(x) = C_1 \\int_{-a}^{x} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\mathrm{d}u + C_2\n$$\nApplying $q(-a)=0$:\n$$\n0 = C_1 \\int_{-a}^{-a} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\mathrm{d}u + C_2 \\implies 0 = 0 + C_2 \\implies C_2=0\n$$\nApplying $q(a)=1$:\n$$\n1 = C_1 \\int_{-a}^{a} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\mathrm{d}u \\implies C_1 = \\frac{1}{\\int_{-a}^{a} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\mathrm{d}u}\n$$\nSubstituting constants back, the explicit expression for the committor is:\n$$\nq(x) = \\frac{\\int_{-a}^{x} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\mathrm{d}u}{\\int_{-a}^{a} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\mathrm{d}u}\n$$\nNote that the committor is indeed independent of $y$, so $q(x,y)=q(x)$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the committor on the hypersurface $x_0 = 0$. Since our solution is independent of $y_0$, this value is constant for all points on this surface. We set $x=0$:\n$$\nq(0) = \\frac{\\int_{-a}^{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\mathrm{d}u}{\\int_{-a}^{a} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\mathrm{d}u}\n$$\nThe problem states that $V(x)$ is an even function, which means $V(u) = V(-u)$. We use this symmetry to simplify the denominator integral:\n$$\n\\int_{-a}^{a} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\mathrm{d}u = \\int_{-a}^{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\mathrm{d}u + \\int_{0}^{a} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\mathrm{d}u\n$$\nIn the second integral, let us perform a change of variables $z = -u$, so $\\mathrm{d}z = -\\mathrm{d}u$. The limits change from $(0, a)$ to $(0, -a)$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{a} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\mathrm{d}u = \\int_{0}^{-a} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(-z)}{k_{B} T}\\right)(-\\mathrm{d}z) = \\int_{-a}^{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(-z)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\mathrm{d}z\n$$\nUsing the even property $V(-z) = V(z)$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{-a}^{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(z)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\mathrm{d}z\n$$\nThus, the two integrals are equal. The denominator is twice the value of the numerator:\n$$\n\\int_{-a}^{a} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\mathrm{d}u = 2 \\int_{-a}^{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\mathrm{d}u\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $q(0)$:\n$$\nq(0) = \\frac{\\int_{-a}^{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\mathrm{d}u}{2 \\int_{-a}^{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(u)}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\mathrm{d}u} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe committor on the hypersurface $x=0$ is constant and equal to $1/2$.\n\nThe final part requires an interpretation. The surface $x=0$ is stated to have an index-$1$ saddle of $V(x)$, which means the full potential $U(x,y)$ has a saddle point at $(0,0)$. In the deterministic Hamiltonian dynamics, this saddle corresponds to a Normally Hyperbolic Invariant Manifold (NHIM). The NHIM is a structure in phase space that governs the reactive dynamics. Its stable and unstable manifolds divide the phase space into regions of reactive and non-reactive trajectories. The configuration-space projection of the NHIM is the surface $x=0$.\nThe committor provides a rigorous, probabilistic definition of the transition state. The true transition state surface is defined as the isocommittor surface $q=1/2$, the locus of points from which a trajectory has an equal probability of proceeding to the product state or returning to the reactant state. Our calculation shows that, for this symmetric potential and symmetric boundary conditions, the surface $x=0$ is precisely the $q=1/2$ isocommittor. This confirms that the geometrically-defined dividing surface $x=0$ is also the dynamically-defined transition state. The reason the committor is constant along the $y$-direction on this surface is that the dynamics along the reaction coordinate $x$ are decoupled from the confining dynamics in the $y$ coordinate. A trajectory at $(0,y)$ is at the peak of the potential barrier in $x$; its fate is determined by the next random fluctuation from the thermal bath. Due to the symmetry of the system, a kick in the $+x$ direction is as probable as a kick in the $-x$ direction, leading to a $50\\%$ chance of reaching either $B$ or $A$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2689082"}]}
