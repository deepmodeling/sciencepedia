It presents a standard exercise in physical chemistry concerning the application of Debye-Hückel theory to a dilute ionic solution. All necessary data are provided, and the tasks are clearly defined. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response: first, a justification for the use of the Debye-Hückel limiting law (DHLL); second, a calculation of the mean activity coefficient $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ under the given conditions; and third, a qualitative discussion of the error associated with using the limiting law.\n\nPart 1: Justification of the Debye-Hückel Limiting Law\n\nThe deviation of an ionic solution from ideal behavior is primarily due to long-range electrostatic interactions among the ions. The chemical potential of an ionic species $i$, $\\mu_i$, is related to its activity $a_i$ by the expression $\\mu_{i} = \\mu_{i}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{i}$, where $\\mu_{i}^{\\circ}$ is the standard chemical potential. By definition, the activity is $a_{i} = \\gamma_{i} c_{i}$, where $\\gamma_i$ is the activity coefficient and $c_i$ is the molar concentration. Substituting this into the chemical potential expression gives $\\mu_{i} = \\mu_{i}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln c_{i} + RT \\ln \\gamma_{i}$. The term $RT \\ln \\gamma_{i}$ represents the excess molar Gibbs free energy, $G_{i}^{\\text{ex}}$, arising from these non-ideal electrostatic interactions. Thus, our goal is to find an expression for $\\ln \\gamma_{i}$, which is equivalent to finding $G_{i}^{\\text{ex}}$.\n\nThe Debye-Hückel theory calculates $G_{i}^{\\text{ex}}$ by modeling the solution as a central ion of charge $z_i e$ surrounded by a diffuse cloud of counter-ions, termed the \"ionic atmosphere.\" The electrostatic potential $\\psi(r)$ at a distance $r$ from this central ion is described by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\psi(r) = -\\frac{\\rho(r)}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of the solvent and $\\rho(r)$ is the local volumetric charge density. The charge density is determined by the Boltzmann distribution of all ion types $j$ in the potential $\\psi(r)$:\n$$\n\\rho(r) = \\sum_{j} n_{j}^{0} z_{j} e \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_j e \\psi(r)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $n_{j}^{0}$ is the bulk number density of ion species $j$.\n\nThe problem specifies working in the \"very dilute limit\" and using the \"linearized Poisson–Boltzmann description\". This is the crucial step that leads to the *limiting* law. In a very dilute solution, the electrostatic potential energy of an ion in the atmosphere is assumed to be much smaller than its thermal energy, i.e., $|z_j e \\psi(r)| \\ll k_B T$. This allows for the linearization of the exponential term, $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$. Applying this approximation, the charge density becomes:\n$$\n\\rho(r) \\approx \\sum_{j} n_{j}^{0} z_{j} e \\left(1 - \\frac{z_j e \\psi(r)}{k_B T}\\right) = \\sum_{j} n_{j}^{0} z_{j} e - \\frac{e^2 \\psi(r)}{k_B T} \\sum_{j} n_{j}^{0} z_{j}^{2}\n$$\nThe first term, $\\sum_{j} n_{j}^{0} z_{j} e$, is zero due to the overall electroneutrality of the bulk solution. The linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation is therefore:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\psi(r) = \\left( \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon k_B T} \\sum_{j} n_{j}^{0} z_{j}^{2} \\right) \\psi(r) = \\kappa^2 \\psi(r)\n$$\nThe parameter $\\kappa$, known as the inverse Debye length, is defined by $\\kappa^2 = \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon k_B T} \\sum_{j} n_{j}^{0} z_{j}^{2}$. The sum can be expressed in terms of the molar ionic strength, $I = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} c_{i} z_{i}^{2}$, by noting that $c_i = n_i^0 / N_A$, where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number. This gives $\\sum_{j} n_{j}^{0} z_{j}^{2} = 2 I N_A$.\n\nThe physically relevant solution to the linearized equation for a spherically symmetric system is the screened Coulomb potential, $\\psi(r) = \\frac{z_i e}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon r} \\exp(-\\kappa r)$. The potential at the position of the central ion ($r \\to 0$) due to the ionic atmosphere alone, $\\psi_{\\text{atm}}$, is the total potential minus the potential of the central ion itself:\n$$\n\\psi_{\\text{atm}} = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\left[ \\psi(r) - \\frac{z_i e}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon r} \\right] = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{z_i e}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon r} (\\exp(-\\kappa r) - 1) = -\\frac{z_i e \\kappa}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon}\n$$\nThe excess Gibbs energy $G_{i}^{\\text{ex}}$ is the work done to charge the ion from $0$ to $z_i e$ in the presence of this atmosphere potential. This is found to be $G_{i}^{\\text{ex}} = -\\frac{N_A (z_i e)^2 \\kappa}{8 \\pi \\varepsilon}$.\nHence,\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{i} = \\frac{G_{i}^{\\text{ex}}}{RT} = -\\frac{N_A (z_i e)^2 \\kappa}{8 \\pi \\varepsilon RT}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\kappa$ in terms of ionic strength $I$ and grouping all constants (for a given solvent and temperature) into a single parameter $A'$, we arrive at the Debye-Hückel limiting law for a single ion:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{i} = - A' z_i^2 \\sqrt{I}\n$$\nor, using base-$10$ logarithm, $\\log_{10} \\gamma_{i} = -A z_i^2 \\sqrt{I}$, where $A = A'/\\ln(10)$. This derivation, based on the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation, is valid only in the limit of extreme dilution ($I \\to 0$), which is why \"very dilute\" is the appropriate regime for its application.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Mean Activity Coefficient\n\nFor an electrolyte that dissociates into $\\nu_+$ cations of charge $z_+$ and $\\nu_-$ anions of charge $z_-$, the mean activity coefficient $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ is defined as $\\gamma_{\\pm} = (\\gamma_{+}^{\\nu_{+}} \\gamma_{-}^{\\nu_{-}})^{1/\\nu}$, where $\\nu = \\nu_+ + \\nu_-$.\nFor a $1{:}1$ electrolyte (e.g., $A^{+}B^{-}$), we have $\\nu_+ = 1$, $\\nu_- = 1$, $z_+ = +1$, and $z_- = -1$. The definition simplifies to $\\gamma_{\\pm} = (\\gamma_{+} \\gamma_{-})^{1/2}$, as given in the problem.\n\nTaking the base-$10$ logarithm gives:\n$$\n\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\log_{10} \\gamma_{+} + \\log_{10} \\gamma_{-})\n$$\nSubstituting the DHLL for each ion:\n$$\n\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{2} (-A z_+^2 \\sqrt{I} - A z_-^2 \\sqrt{I}) = -\\frac{A \\sqrt{I}}{2} (z_+^2 + z_-^2)\n$$\nFor a $1{:}1$ electrolyte, this becomes:\n$$\n\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm} = -\\frac{A \\sqrt{I}}{2} (1^2 + (-1)^2) = -\\frac{A \\sqrt{I}}{2} (2) = -A\\sqrt{I}\n$$\nThis is the specific form of the DHLL for a $1{:}1$ electrolyte. We are given the values $A = 0.509\\,\\mathrm{L^{1/2}\\,mol^{-1/2}}$ and $I = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.\nFirst, calculate the square root of the ionic strength:\n$$\n\\sqrt{I} = \\sqrt{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\sqrt{0.001} \\approx 0.03162277...\n$$\nNow, substitute the values into the DHLL expression:\n$$\n\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm} = - (0.509) \\times (0.03162277...) \\approx -0.0160960...\n$$\nTo find $\\gamma_{\\pm}$, we take the antilogarithm:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\pm} = 10^{-0.0160960...} \\approx 0.96362...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $\\gamma_{\\pm} = 0.9636$.\n\nPart 3: Qualitative Discussion of Error\n\nThe Debye-Hückel limiting law is an approximation based on two key simplifications: ions are treated as point charges, and the Poisson-Boltzmann equation is linearized. The error incurred by using the DHLL at a non-zero ionic strength of $I = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$ arises mainly from the point-charge approximation.\n\nReal ions have a finite size. This means that ions in the atmosphere cannot approach the central ion closer than a certain distance of closest approach, typically denoted by $a$. This physical constraint is ignored in the limiting law. The finite ion size reduces the overall electrostatic stabilization because the average distance between the central ion and its atmosphere is larger than predicted by the point-charge model. Consequently, the true excess Gibbs energy, $G^{\\text{ex}}$, is less negative than the DHLL prediction. A less negative $G^{\\text{ex}}$ implies that $\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm}$ is also less negative (i.e., closer to zero), which in turn means that the actual value of $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ is larger (closer to $1$) than the value predicted by the limiting law.\n\nMore refined models, such as the extended Debye-Hückel equation, account for finite ion size. This model takes the form:\n$$\n\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm} = -\\frac{A|z_+ z_-|\\sqrt{I}}{1 + B a \\sqrt{I}}\n$$\nwhere $B$ is another constant dependent on the solvent and temperature, and $a$ is the ion-size parameter. The denominator $(1 + B a \\sqrt{I})$ is greater than $1$, which directly reduces the magnitude of $\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm}$ and thus predicts a value of $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ that is closer to $1$.\n\nFor the specific conditions of a $1{:}1$ electrolyte in water at $I = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$, the ionic strength is quite low. The correction term $B a \\sqrt{I}$ in the denominator of the extended law is very small compared to $1$. Therefore, the DHLL provides a good first approximation, and the error incurred by its use is expected to be small. The limiting law will slightly overestimate the deviation from ideality, predicting a value for $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ that is slightly lower than what would be obtained from more sophisticated models or from experimental measurement. The magnitude of this error for a $1{:}1$ electrolyte at this low ionic strength is typically less than one percent.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9636}\n$$", "id": "2637498"}, {"introduction": "This practice synthesizes the concepts of ionic strength and activity coefficients to address the central theme: their impact on reaction rates.

This is the expected kinetic salt effect for a reaction between ions of opposite charge ($z_{A}z_{B}  0$), as the increased ionic atmosphere shields the electrostatic attraction between the reactants.\n\nRegarding the applicability of this treatment, the Debye-Hückel theory and its extensions are limiting laws, most accurate at very low ionic strengths. The expression used is a common semi-empirical form that extends applicability to higher concentrations than the limiting law ($\\log_{10} \\gamma \\propto \\sqrt{I}$). At $I=0.010\\,\\text{M}$, the model can be considered a reasonable approximation. However, at $I=0.10\\,\\text{M}$, its accuracy is questionable. The model neglects several factors that become significant at this concentration:\n1.  **Ion Size and Specific Ion Effects**: The model assumes a universal behavior determined only by charge, ignoring the specific size and chemical nature of the ions present.\n2.  **Ion Pairing**: At $0.10\\,\\text{M}$, formation of ion pairs (e.g., $\\text{MgCl}^{+}$) can become significant, which would reduce the concentration of free reactant ions and alter the effective ionic strength. This is explicitly neglected.\nDespite these limitations, the calculation correctly predicts the qualitative trend and provides a first-order quantitative estimate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.497}\n$$", "id": "2637489"}]}
