When $[B]_{0}$ is large, the dimensionless ratio $\\varepsilon = k_{1}[B]_{0}/k_{2}$ can be of order unity, so the production and consumption of $I$ occur on comparable time scales. In this regime, $[I](t)$ exhibits a pronounced transient with $d[I]/dt \\neq 0$ except at its peak; enforcing $d[I]/dt \\approx 0$ globally (QSSA) overestimates the intermediate, as quantified by $R(0.9) \\approx 0.3874$. A concrete, scientifically plausible parameter set that realizes $\\varepsilon \\approx 0.9$ with $[A]_{0} \\ll [B]_{0}$ and a numerically smaller $k_{1}$ than $k_{2}$ is, for example, $k_{1} = 1.1 \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{2} = 1.0 \\times 10^8~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $[B]_{0} = 8.18~\\mathrm{M}$, and $[A]_{0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{M}$, for which $\\varepsilon \\approx 0.9$ and $[A]_{0}/[B]_{0} \\approx 6.1 \\times 10^{-5}$. This counterexample shows that ignoring the large co-reactant concentration in the timescale comparison leads directly to QSSA breakdown.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3874}$$", "id": "2650870"}]}
