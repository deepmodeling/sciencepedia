In initiation, primary radicals are generated at an effective volumetric rate $R_i$ (moles per volume per time). In propagation, a living polymer radical $\\mathrm{P}_n^\\bullet$ adds monomer $\\mathrm{M}$ to grow by one repeat unit according to elementary mass action with second-order rate constant $k_p$. Termination occurs exclusively by bimolecular radical-radical reactions via two competing channels: recombination (also called combination), in which two living radicals couple to form a single dead polymer chain, with second-order rate coefficient $k_{\\text{comb}}$, and disproportionation, in which two living radicals transfer hydrogen to produce two dead polymer chains, with second-order rate coefficient $k_{\\text{disp}}$.

Express the final answer without units.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard, well-posed exercise in the chemical kinetics of polymerization. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. All necessary assumptions, definitions, and kinetic parameters are provided to derive a unique analytical solution. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe task is twofold: first, to state the mechanistic distinction between recombination and disproportionation termination, and second, to derive an expression for the number-average degree of polymerization, $X_n$.\n\nFirst, we address the mechanistic distinction. In a free-radical polymerization, termination events consume living polymer radicals to form stable, non-reactive \"dead\" polymer chains.\n- **Recombination (or Combination)**: Two living polymer radicals, for instance $\\mathrm{P}_n^\\bullet$ and $\\mathrm{P}_m^\\bullet$, couple directly to form a single, longer dead polymer chain $\\mathrm{P}_{n+m}$. Thus, one termination encounter via recombination produces **one** dead polymer molecule. The chemical equation is:\n$$ \\mathrm{P}_n^\\bullet + \\mathrm{P}_m^\\bullet \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{comb}}} \\mathrm{P}_{n+m} $$\n- **Disproportionation**: One living radical abstracts an atom (typically a hydrogen atom) from another. This results in two dead polymer chains: one saturated and one with a terminal double bond. For instance, $\\mathrm{P}_n^\\bullet$ and $\\mathrm{P}_m^\\bullet$ react to form $\\mathrm{P}_n$ and $\\mathrm{P}_m$. Thus, one termination encounter via disproportionation produces **two** dead polymer molecules. The chemical equation is:\n$$ \\mathrm{P}_n^\\bullet + \\mathrm{P}_m^\\bullet \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{disp}}} \\mathrm{P}_n + \\mathrm{P}_m $$\n\nNow, we proceed to the derivation of $X_n$. The number-average degree of polymerization, $X_n$, is defined as the average number of monomer units incorporated per polymer molecule formed. This can be expressed as the ratio of the rate of monomer consumption to the rate of formation of dead polymer molecules.\n$$ X_n = \\frac{\\text{Rate of monomer consumption}}{\\text{Rate of dead polymer formation}} $$\n\nThe rate of monomer consumption occurs overwhelmingly during the propagation step. The rate of propagation, $R_p$, is given by the elementary mass-action law for the reaction $\\mathrm{P}_n^\\bullet + \\mathrm{M} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{P}_{n+1}^\\bullet$. Summing over all chain lengths, the total rate of propagation is:\n$$ R_p = k_p [\\mathrm{M}] \\sum_n [\\mathrm{P}_n^\\bullet] = k_p [\\mathrm{M}] [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet] $$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]$ is the total concentration of all living polymer radicals.\n\nNext, we must determine the rate of formation of dead polymer molecules. Let us designate this rate as $R_{form}$. Dead polymers are formed by both recombination and disproportionation events.\nThe rate of recombination events, involving two radicals, is $k_{\\text{comb}} [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]^2$. Since each recombination event produces one dead polymer molecule, the rate of polymer formation from recombination is $k_{\\text{comb}} [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]^2$.\nThe rate of disproportionation events is $k_{\\text{disp}} [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]^2$. Since each disproportionation event produces two dead polymer molecules, the rate of polymer formation from disproportionation is $2 k_{\\text{disp}} [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]^2$.\nThe total rate of formation of dead polymer molecules is the sum of these two rates:\n$$ R_{form} = k_{\\text{comb}} [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]^2 + 2 k_{\\text{disp}} [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]^2 = (k_{\\text{comb}} + 2 k_{\\text{disp}}) [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]^2 $$\n\nNow we can write an intermediate expression for $X_n$ by substituting the expressions for $R_p$ and $R_{form}$:\n$$ X_n = \\frac{R_p}{R_{form}} = \\frac{k_p [\\mathrm{M}] [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]}{(k_{\\text{comb}} + 2 k_{\\text{disp}}) [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]^2} = \\frac{k_p [\\mathrm{M}]}{(k_{\\text{comb}} + 2 k_{\\text{disp}}) [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]} $$\n\nThis expression contains the unknown radical concentration $[\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]$. We find $[\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]$ by applying the Steady-State Approximation (SSA), which posits that the rate of radical generation (initiation) is equal to the rate of radical destruction (termination).\nThe rate of radical generation is given as $R_i$.\nThe rate of radical destruction, or the rate of termination $R_t$, accounts for the consumption of radicals. In each termination event, whether by recombination or disproportionation, two radicals are consumed. The overall termination rate constant is $k_t = k_{\\text{comb}} + k_{\\text{disp}}$. Therefore, the rate of radical consumption is:\n$$ R_t = 2 (k_{\\text{comb}} + k_{\\text{disp}}) [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]^2 $$\nApplying the SSA, we set the rate of initiation equal to the rate of termination:\n$$ R_i = R_t = 2 (k_{\\text{comb}} + k_{\\text{disp}}) [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]^2 $$\nSolving for the steady-state radical concentration $[\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet] = \\left( \\frac{R_i}{2(k_{\\text{comb}} + k_{\\text{disp}})} \\right)^{1/2} $$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $[\\mathrm{R}^\\bullet]$ back into our equation for $X_n$:\n$$ X_n = \\frac{k_p [\\mathrm{M}]}{(k_{\\text{comb}} + 2 k_{\\text{disp}}) \\left( \\frac{R_i}{2(k_{\\text{comb}} + k_{\\text{disp}})} \\right)^{1/2}} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged to provide the final closed-form solution:\n$$ X_n = \\frac{k_p [\\mathrm{M}]}{(k_{\\text{comb}} + 2 k_{\\text{disp}})} \\frac{\\sqrt{2(k_{\\text{comb}} + k_{\\text{disp}})}}{\\sqrt{R_i}} $$\n$$ X_n = \\frac{k_p [\\mathrm{M}] \\sqrt{2(k_{\\text{comb}} + k_{\\text{disp}})}}{\\sqrt{R_i}(k_{\\text{comb}} + 2 k_{\\text{disp}})} $$\nThis is the required expression for the number-average degree of polymerization as a function of the given parameters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_p [\\mathrm{M}] \\sqrt{2(k_{\\text{comb}} + k_{\\text{disp}})}}{\\sqrt{R_i}(k_{\\text{comb}} + 2 k_{\\text{disp}})}}\n$$", "id": "2631169"}, {"introduction": "In many real-world reactors, reaction conditions are not uniform.

The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary physical laws, variables, and boundary conditions ($I(0) = I_0$) to derive a unique solution. The idealizations (e.g., uniform concentration, no scattering) are standard simplifying assumptions used to obtain an analytical solution and do not constitute a flaw. The terminology is precise and the goal is clearly defined. The problem is neither trivial nor ill-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We will proceed with a full derivation.\n\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental principles governing photon transport and absorption. The Beer-Lambert law describes the attenuation of light intensity in an absorbing medium. For a one-dimensional system, this is expressed as a first-order ordinary differential equation for the photon flux density $I(z)$:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dz} = -\\alpha I(z) $$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the Napierian absorption coefficient. The boundary condition is the incident flux at the front surface of the slab, $I(z=0) = I_0$. We solve this differential equation by separation of variables:\n$$ \\int_{I_0}^{I(z)} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = -\\int_0^z \\alpha \\,dz' $$\nSince $\\alpha$ is assumed to be spatially uniform, the integration yields:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{I(z)}{I_0}\\right) = -\\alpha z $$\nSolving for $I(z)$ gives the explicit expression for the photon flux density as a function of depth:\n$$ I(z) = I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z) $$\nThe local volumetric rate of photon absorption, which we denote as $r_{abs}(z)$, is given by the negative divergence of the photon flux vector. In one dimension, this simplifies to the negative derivative of $I(z)$:\n$$ r_{abs}(z) = -\\frac{dI}{dz} $$\nSubstituting the Beer-Lambert law into this expression, we find that the local absorption rate is directly proportional to the local intensity:\n$$ r_{abs}(z) = -(-\\alpha I(z)) = \\alpha I(z) = \\alpha I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z) $$\nThe units of $r_{abs}(z)$ are mol photons m$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$, as required for a volumetric rate.\n\nNext, we define the local volumetric rate of radical generation, $r_i(z)$. The problem states that the quantum yield $\\Phi$ is the average number of radicals produced per absorbed photon. Therefore, $r_i(z)$ is the product of the quantum yield and the local rate of photon absorption:\n$$ r_i(z) = \\Phi \\cdot r_{abs}(z) = \\Phi \\alpha I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z) $$\nThe units of $r_i(z)$ are mol radicals m$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$.\n\nThe objective is to find the spatially averaged volumetric initiation rate, $\\bar{r}_i$, over the slab thickness $L$. This is defined by the integral:\n$$ \\bar{r}_i = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_0^L r_i(z)\\,dz $$\nWe substitute the expression for $r_i(z)$ into this integral:\n$$ \\bar{r}_i = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_0^L \\Phi \\alpha I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z)\\,dz $$\nThe terms $\\Phi$, $\\alpha$, $I_0$, and $L$ are constants with respect to the integration variable $z$, so we can move them outside the integral:\n$$ \\bar{r}_i = \\frac{\\Phi \\alpha I_0}{L} \\int_0^L \\exp(-\\alpha z)\\,dz $$\nThe integral of the exponential function is straightforward:\n$$ \\int_0^L \\exp(-\\alpha z)\\,dz = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha z) \\right]_0^L = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}(\\exp(-\\alpha L) - \\exp(0)) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha L)) $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\bar{r}_i$:\n$$ \\bar{r}_i = \\frac{\\Phi \\alpha I_0}{L} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha L)) \\right) $$\nThe term $\\alpha$ cancels, leading to the final closed-form expression for the spatially averaged initiation rate:\n$$ \\bar{r}_i = \\frac{\\Phi I_0}{L} (1 - \\exp(-\\alpha L)) $$\nThis expression gives the average rate of radical formation in the specified units of mol m$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$.\n\nWe now analyze the limiting behaviors of this expression.\n\nCase 1: Weak absorption ($\\alpha L \\ll 1$).\nThis condition describes an optically thin slab. We use the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function, $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x$ for small $x$. Letting $x = \\alpha L$, we have $\\exp(-\\alpha L) \\approx 1 - \\alpha L$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\bar{r}_i$:\n$$ \\bar{r}_i \\approx \\frac{\\Phi I_0}{L} (1 - (1 - \\alpha L)) = \\frac{\\Phi I_0}{L} (\\alpha L) = \\Phi \\alpha I_0 $$\nIn the weak absorption limit, the average initiation rate is independent of the slab thickness $L$ and is linearly proportional to the absorption coefficient $\\alpha$ and the incident flux $I_0$. This is physically consistent: when the slab is optically thin, the light intensity $I(z)$ is approximately constant and equal to $I_0$ throughout the volume. The local initiation rate is therefore nearly uniform, $r_i(z) \\approx \\Phi \\alpha I_0$, and its average value is simply this constant.\n\nCase 2: Strong absorption ($\\alpha L \\gg 1$).\nThis condition describes an optically thick slab. As $\\alpha L \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(-\\alpha L) \\to 0$. The expression for $\\bar{r}_i$ becomes:\n$$ \\bar{r}_i \\to \\frac{\\Phi I_0}{L} (1 - 0) = \\frac{\\Phi I_0}{L} $$\nIn this limit, the average initiation rate becomes independent of the absorption coefficient $\\alpha$ and is inversely proportional to the slab thickness $L$. The physical reason is that for an optically thick slab, all incident photons are absorbed within the slab. The total number of photons entering the slab per unit area is $I_0$. The total number of radicals generated per unit area is thus $\\Phi I_0$. The average volumetric rate is this total rate per area distributed over the volume, which has a thickness $L$, resulting in $\\bar{r}_i = (\\Phi I_0)/L$. The rate is independent of $\\alpha$ because, provided $\\alpha$ is large enough to absorb all light, its precise value does not change the total number of absorbed photons.\n\nFinally, we address the spatial distribution of initiation under strong absorption. The local rate $r_i(z) = \\Phi \\alpha I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z)$ shows an exponential decay with depth $z$. The characteristic length scale for this decay is the absorption depth, $1/\\alpha$. For strong absorption, $\\alpha L \\gg 1$, which implies $L \\gg 1/\\alpha$. Consequently, the vast majority of photoinitiation events occur in a thin layer near the irradiated surface ($z=0$). The initiation rate is maximal at $z=0$ ($r_i(0) = \\Phi \\alpha I_0$) and decays to negligible values deep within the slab, long before reaching the back surface at $z=L$. This highly non-uniform distribution, dictated by the Beer-Lambert law, leads to steep gradients in radical concentration, which is a defining feature of many photochemically driven processes such as photopolymerization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\Phi I_0}{L} \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha L)\\right)}$$", "id": "2631199"}, {"introduction": "Chain reactions can exhibit dramatic, non-linear behavior, including the potential for explosions.
