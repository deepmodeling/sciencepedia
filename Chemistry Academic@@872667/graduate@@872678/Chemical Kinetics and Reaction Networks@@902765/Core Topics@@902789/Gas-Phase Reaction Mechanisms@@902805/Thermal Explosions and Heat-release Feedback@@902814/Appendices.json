It represents a standard, fundamental problem in chemical reaction kinetics. It is based on established conservation laws and kinetic models, contains no contradictions or missing information, and asks for a rigorous derivation. Therefore, the problem is valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis is structured into three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n1) Derivation of the relationship between temperature $T$ and concentration $C_{A}$.\n\nWe begin from first principles for a well-stirred, constant-volume, adiabatic batch reactor.\n\nThe species conservation equation for reactant $A$ in a constant-volume ($V$) batch reactor is given by the a mole balance:\n$$ \\frac{d(V C_{A})}{dt} = -r_{A} V $$\nSince the volume $V$ is constant, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dC_{A}}{dt} = -r_{A} $$\nSubstituting the given first-order kinetic law, $r_{A} = k(T) C_{A}$, we obtain the species balance:\n$$ \\frac{dC_{A}}{dt} = -k(T) C_{A} \\quad (1) $$\n\nNext, we apply the First Law of Thermodynamics. For an adiabatic, constant-volume reacting system with no shaft work, the rate of change of the total internal energy $U$ of the system is equal to the rate at which heat is generated by the chemical reaction.\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dt} = V r_{A} (-\\Delta H_{r}) $$\nUsing the definition $q \\equiv -\\Delta H_{r}$, this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dt} = V q r_{A} $$\nThe total internal energy is $U = m u = (\\rho V) u$, where $u$ is the specific internal energy and $\\rho$ is the density. Since $\\rho$ and $V$ are constant:\n$$ \\rho V \\frac{du}{dt} = V q r_{A} \\implies \\rho \\frac{du}{dt} = q r_{A} $$\nFor a condensed-phase system, the change in specific internal energy $du$ is well-approximated by $C_{v}dT$. Furthermore, for liquids and solids, the constant-volume heat capacity $C_{v}$ is nearly equal to the constant-pressure heat capacity $C_{p}$. The problem provides $C_p$ and assumes it is constant, justifying the approximation $du \\approx C_{p} dT$. Applying this, the energy balance becomes:\n$$ \\rho C_{p} \\frac{dT}{dt} = q r_{A} $$\nSubstituting the kinetic expression $r_{A} = k(T) C_{A}$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{q}{\\rho C_{p}} k(T) C_{A} \\quad (2) $$\n\nTo eliminate the explicit time dependence and find a relation between $T$ and $C_{A}$, we use the chain rule to compute the derivative $dT/dC_{A}$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dC_{A}} = \\frac{dT/dt}{dC_{A}/dt} $$\nSubstituting equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ into this expression yields:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dC_{A}} = \\frac{\\frac{q}{\\rho C_{p}} k(T) C_{A}}{-k(T) C_{A}} $$\nThe term $k(T) C_{A}$ cancels, demonstrating that the resulting relationship is independent of the reaction kinetics, provided the stoichiometry is fixed.\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dC_{A}} = -\\frac{q}{\\rho C_{p}} $$\nThis is a simple separable ordinary differential equation. We integrate it from the initial state $(T_{0}, C_{A0})$ to an arbitrary state $(T, C_{A})$:\n$$ \\int_{T_{0}}^{T} dT' = -\\frac{q}{\\rho C_{p}} \\int_{C_{A0}}^{C_{A}} dC'_{A} $$\nPerforming the integration gives:\n$$ T - T_{0} = -\\frac{q}{\\rho C_{p}} (C_{A} - C_{A0}) $$\nRearranging to solve for $T(C_{A})$ provides the required explicit closed-form expression:\n$$ T(C_{A}) = T_{0} + \\frac{q}{\\rho C_{p}} (C_{A0} - C_{A}) $$\nThis equation shows a linear relationship between the reactor temperature and the concentration of the reactant.\n\n2) Implicit expression for $T(t)$ and asymptotic analysis.\n\nTo find the temperature trajectory $T(t)$, we first express $C_{A}$ as a function of $T$ using the result from part 1):\n$$ C_{A}(T) = C_{A0} - \\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q} (T - T_{0}) $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $C_{A}(T)$ and the Arrhenius form for $k(T)$ into the energy balance, equation $(2)$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{q}{\\rho C_{p}} k_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT}\\right) \\left( C_{A0} - \\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q} (T - T_{0}) \\right) $$\nThis is a separable differential equation for $T(t)$. We separate variables:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{k_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT}\\right) \\left( C_{A0} - \\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q} (T - T_{0}) \\right)} = \\frac{q}{\\rho C_{p}} dt $$\nIntegrating from the initial condition $T(0) = T_{0}$ to a general time $t$ where the temperature is $T(t)$ gives the implicit solution for $T(t)$ as a quadrature:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{t} d\\tau = t = \\int_{T_{0}}^{T(t)} \\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q} \\frac{dT'}{k_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT'}\\right) \\left( C_{A0} - \\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q} (T' - T_{0}) \\right)} $$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q k_{0}} \\int_{T_{0}}^{T(t)} \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E}{RT'}\\right)}{C_{A0} - \\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q} (T' - T_{0})} dT' $$\nThe adiabatic temperature rise limit occurs when the reactant is completely consumed, i.e., $C_{A} \\to 0$. From the result of part 1), the final temperature $T_{f}$ is:\n$$ T_{f} = T(C_{A}=0) = T_{0} + \\frac{q C_{A0}}{\\rho C_{p}} = T_{0} + \\Delta T_{\\text{ad}} $$\nTo analyze the approach to this limit as $t \\to \\infty$, we examine the behavior of the integrand as the upper limit of integration $T(t)$ approaches $T_{f}$. The denominator of the integrand can be rewritten as:\n$$ C_{A0} - \\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q} (T' - T_{0}) = \\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q} \\left( \\frac{q C_{A0}}{\\rho C_{p}} - (T' - T_{0}) \\right) = \\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q} ( (T_{f} - T_{0}) - (T' - T_{0}) ) = \\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q} (T_{f} - T') $$\nAs $T' \\to T_{f}$, the denominator approaches zero. The numerator, $\\exp(E/(RT'))$, approaches the finite, non-zero constant $\\exp(E/(RT_{f}))$. Therefore, the integrand has a simple pole and behaves like $(T_{f} - T')^{-1}$ near $T' = T_{f}$. The integral of such a function diverges logarithmically as the integration limit approaches the pole. Specifically, the integral diverges as $T(t) \\to T_{f}$. Consequently, $T(t)$ approaches $T_{f}$ only in the limit $t \\to \\infty$.\n\n3) Finite versus infinite time to reach the final temperature.\n\nAs established in the asymptotic analysis of part 2), the time required to reach the final temperature $T_{f} = T_{0} + \\Delta T_{\\text{ad}}$ is given by the definite integral:\n$$ t_{final} = \\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q k_{0}} \\int_{T_{0}}^{T_{f}} \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E}{RT'}\\right)}{C_{A0} - \\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q} (T' - T_{0})} dT' $$\nThe integrand is singular at the upper limit of integration, $T' = T_{f}$. Near this limit, let $\\epsilon = T_{f} - T'$, where $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$. The integrand behaves as:\n$$ \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E}{RT'}\\right)}{\\frac{\\rho C_{p}}{q} (T_{f} - T')} \\sim \\frac{\\text{Constant}}{\\epsilon} $$\nThe integral of $1/\\epsilon$ with respect to $\\epsilon$ is $\\ln(\\epsilon)$, which diverges to $-\\infty$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$. This confirms that the value of the integral is infinite. Thus, the final temperature $T_{f}$ is approached asymptotically but is never reached in finite time.\n\nThis conclusion can also be reasoned from the governing rate equations. The rate of reaction is $r_{A} = k(T)C_{A}$. As the reaction proceeds, $C_{A}(t) \\to 0$. Even though the temperature rises and $k(T)$ increases, the rate of reaction $r_{A}$ must approach zero as its fuel, reactant $A$, is depleted. Since the rate of temperature change, $dT/dt = (q / (\\rho C_{p})) r_{A}$, is directly proportional to the reaction rate, $dT/dt$ also approaches zero. A system whose rate of change approaches zero as it nears its final state will only reach that state after infinite time. This is characteristic of first-order (and many other) kinetic processes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{T(C_A) = T_{0} + \\frac{q (C_{A0} - C_{A})}{\\rho C_{p}}}$$", "id": "2689481"}, {"introduction": "Building on the adiabatic case, we now introduce the crucial role of heat loss through conduction, leading to the celebrated Frank-Kamenetskii model for a reactive solid.

We define:\n    -   Dimensionless spatial coordinate: $\\boldsymbol{\\xi} = \\mathbf{x} / L$\n    -   Dimensionless temperature (Frank-Kamenetskii scaling): $\\theta = \\frac{T - T_a}{T_a} \\frac{E}{RT_a}$. This scaling choice is crucial, as it leads to a single-parameter model in the asymptotic limit. We can express the dimensional temperature as $T = T_a \\left(1 + \\theta \\frac{RT_a}{E}\\right)$.\n    -   Dimensionless time: $\\tau = t / t_c$, where $t_c$ is a characteristic time scale to be determined.\n\n2.  **Transformation of the Heat Equation**:\n    We compute the terms in the heat equation using these new variables.\n    -   Time derivative: $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[T_a \\left(1 + \\theta \\frac{RT_a}{E}\\right)\\right] = T_a \\frac{RT_a}{E} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\tau} \\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = \\frac{RT_a^2}{E t_c} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\tau}$.\n    -   Laplacian: $\\nabla^2 T = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^2 \\left[T_a \\left(1 + \\theta \\frac{RT_a}{E}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{RT_a^2}{E} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^2 \\theta$. Since $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}$, we have $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^2 = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}^2$. Thus, $\\nabla^2 T = \\frac{RT_a^2}{E L^2} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}^2 \\theta$.\n\n3.  **Approximation of the Arrhenius Term**: The exponent is $-E/(RT)$. Substituting for $T$:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{E}{RT} = -\\frac{E}{R T_a \\left(1 + \\theta \\frac{RT_a}{E}\\right)}\n    $$\n    Let $\\epsilon = RT_a/E$. In the high activation energy limit, $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. The exponent becomes:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1 + \\epsilon \\theta)}\n    $$\n    Using the Taylor expansion $1/(1+z) \\approx 1-z$ for small $z = \\epsilon\\theta$, we get:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}(1 - \\epsilon \\theta + O(\\epsilon^2)) = -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} + \\theta + O(\\epsilon)\n    $$\n    The Arrhenius term is then approximated as:\n    $$\n    \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT}\\right) \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_a} + \\theta\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_a}\\right) e^{\\theta}\n    $$\n    This is the Frank-Kamenetskii approximation.\n\n4.  **Assembling the Dimensionless Equation**:\n    Substituting the transformed terms into the original energy balance:\n    $$\n    \\rho C_p \\left(\\frac{RT_a^2}{E t_c} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\tau}\\right) = k_{th} \\left(\\frac{RT_a^2}{E L^2} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}^2 \\theta\\right) + Q c_0 A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_a}\\right) e^{\\theta}\n    $$\n    To simplify, we multiply the entire equation by $\\frac{E L^2}{k_{th} R T_a^2}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\rho C_p L^2}{k_{th} t_c} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\tau} = \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}^2 \\theta + \\left[\\frac{E L^2 Q c_0 A}{k_{th} R T_a^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_a}\\right)\\right] e^{\\theta}\n    $$\n    We choose the characteristic time $t_c$ to be the thermal diffusion time, $t_c = L^2 / \\alpha$, where $\\alpha = k_{th} / (\\rho C_p)$ is the thermal diffusivity. This sets the coefficient of the time derivative to $1$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\rho C_p L^2}{k_{th} (L^2 \\rho C_p / k_{th})} = 1\n    $$\n    The equation becomes:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\tau} = \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}^2 \\theta + \\delta e^{\\theta}\n    $$\n    where we have defined the single dimensionless heat-release parameter, the **Frank-Kamenetskii parameter $\\delta$**:\n    $$\n    \\delta = \\frac{E}{R T_a^2} \\frac{Q c_0 L^2}{k_{th}} A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_a}\\right)\n    $$\n    This parameter represents the ratio of the characteristic rate of heat generation to the characteristic rate of heat removal by diffusion.\n\n5.  **Initial-Boundary Value Problem**:\n    The boundary condition $T=T_a$ on the physical boundary $\\partial\\Omega_{phys}$ becomes, in terms of $\\theta$:\n    $$\n    \\theta = \\frac{T_a - T_a}{T_a} \\frac{E}{RT_a} = 0\n    $$\n    This is a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on the dimensionless boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. An initial condition $T(\\mathbf{x},0) = T_0(\\mathbf{x})$ translates to an initial condition for $\\theta$. Renaming variables for convention ($\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\to \\mathbf{x}$, $\\tau \\to t$), the final dimensionless initial-boundary value problem is:\n    $$\n    \\begin{cases}\n    \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\nabla^2 \\theta + \\delta e^{\\theta}, & \\mathbf{x} \\in \\Omega, t > 0 \\\\\n    \\theta(\\mathbf{x}, t) = 0, & \\mathbf{x} \\in \\partial\\Omega, t > 0 \\\\\n    \\theta(\\mathbf{x}, 0) = \\theta_0(\\mathbf{x}), & \\mathbf{x} \\in \\Omega\n    \\end{cases}\n    $$\n\n### Task B: Mathematical Characterization of Criticality\n\nWe analyze the one-dimensional problem on the domain $x \\in (0,1)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2} + \\delta e^{\\theta}\n$$\nwith boundary conditions $\\theta(0, t) = \\theta(1, t) = 0$.\n\nThe existence of thermal runaway (blowup) versus bounded behavior is determined by the properties of the corresponding steady-state problem:\n$$\n\\theta_s''(x) + \\delta e^{\\theta_s(x)} = 0, \\quad x \\in (0,1)\n$$\nwith boundary conditions $\\theta_s(0) = \\theta_s(1) = 0$. We seek non-trivial positive solutions, $\\theta_s(x) > 0$ on $(0,1)$.\n\n1.  **Existence of Steady Solutions**: The equation $\\theta_s'' = -\\delta e^{\\theta_s}$ shows that for $\\delta > 0$, any non-trivial solution must be strictly concave ($\\theta_s'' < 0$). Combined with the zero boundary conditions, this implies any such solution is positive in the interior, symmetric about $x=1/2$, and has a single maximum $\\theta_m = \\theta_s(1/2)$. The existence and number of solutions to this nonlinear boundary value problem depend on the parameter $\\delta$.\n    -   For $\\delta=0$, the only solution is the trivial one, $\\theta_s(x) = 0$.\n    -   As $\\delta$ increases from $0$, a pair of positive solutions emerges through a saddle-node bifurcation. This can be understood by considering a bifurcation diagram of $\\delta$ versus the maximum temperature $\\theta_m$. This curve starts at $(\\theta_m, \\delta) = (0, 0)$, increases to a maximum value $\\delta = \\delta_c$ at some $\\theta_m = \\theta_{m,c}$, and then turns back, decreasing for larger $\\theta_m$.\n    -   This 'nose-shaped' bifurcation curve implies that:\n        -   For $0 < \\delta < \\delta_c$, there exist exactly two steady solutions: a lower-branch solution with smaller $\\theta_m$ and an upper-branch solution with larger $\\theta_m$.\n        -   For $\\delta = \\delta_c$, there is exactly one solution.\n        -   For $\\delta > \\delta_c$, there are no steady solutions.\n\n2.  **Stability and Transient Behavior**: The behavior of the transient equation is governed by these steady states.\n    -   **Subcritical case ($0 < \\delta < \\delta_c$)**: Analysis shows that the lower-branch solution is stable, while the upper-branch solution is unstable. By the maximum principle for parabolic equations, the stable steady solution can act as a stationary supersolution. If the initial data $\\theta(x,0)$ is \"small enough\" (e.g., lies entirely below the stable steady-state profile), the solution $\\theta(x,t)$ will be bounded for all time and will typically converge to this stable steady state.\n    -   **Supercritical case ($\\delta > \\delta_c$)**: In this regime, no steady solution exists. There is no stationary state for the system to settle into. The physical interpretation is that the rate of heat generation, scaled by $\\delta$, is too large to be balanced by heat diffusion. For any sufficiently positive initial condition, the nonlinear source term $\\delta e^{\\theta}$ will dominate the linear diffusion term $\\theta_{xx}$. The temperature will rise, which further accelerates the reaction rate, leading to a positive feedback loop. This self-accelerating process, unhindered by any stable equilibrium, results in the solution becoming unbounded in finite time, i.e., $\\max_x \\theta(x,t) \\to \\infty$ as $t \\to t_b$ for some finite blowup time $t_b$. This is thermal runaway.\n\nThus, the critical parameter $\\delta_c$ marks the threshold for the existence of an equilibrium between heat generation and heat removal. Below this threshold, a stable balance is possible for small perturbations; above it, no such balance exists, and runaway is inevitable for non-trivial heating.\n\n### Task C: Numerical Implementation Approach\n\nThe task is to solve the one-dimensional transient problem numerically using the method-of-lines.\n\n1.  **Spatial Discretization**: We discretize the spatial domain $x \\in [0,1]$ into $N+2$ points, $x_i = i h$ for $i=0, \\dots, N+1$, where $h=1/(N+1)$ is the uniform grid spacing. We are interested in the $N$ interior points. Let $\\theta_i(t)$ be the numerical approximation of $\\theta(x_i, t)$. The second-order central difference approximation for the Laplacian is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{x=x_i} \\approx \\frac{\\theta_{i-1}(t) - 2\\theta_i(t) + \\theta_{i+1}(t)}{h^2}\n    $$\n    The boundary conditions are $\\theta_0(t) = 0$ and $\\theta_{N+1}(t) = 0$.\n\n2.  **System of ODEs**: This discretization converts the partial differential equation into a system of $N$ coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n    $$\n    \\frac{d\\theta_i}{dt} = \\frac{\\theta_{i-1} - 2\\theta_i + \\theta_{i+1}}{h^2} + \\delta e^{\\theta_i}, \\quad i = 1, \\dots, N\n    $$\n    In vector form, let $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t) = [\\theta_1(t), \\dots, \\theta_N(t)]^T$. The system is $\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}(t, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, where\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{f}(t, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{h^2}\\mathbf{A}\\boldsymbol{\\theta} + \\delta e^{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\n    $$\n    Here, $e^{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ is an element-wise exponential, and $\\mathbf{A}$ is the $N \\times N$ tridiagonal matrix representing the discrete Laplacian with homogeneous Dirichlet boundaries:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    -2 & 1 & 0 & \\dots \\\\\n    1 & -2 & 1 & \\dots \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots \\\\\n    0 & \\dots & 1 & -2\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Time Integration**: The resulting ODE system is stiff, especially as a solution approaches blowup, due to the large negative eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}/h^2$ (from diffusion) and the large positive derivative of the exponential term. A stiff ODE solver, such as `Radau` or `BDF` available in `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, is required for stable and efficient integration.\n\n4.  **Blowup Detection**: To detect thermal runaway, we use an event-triggering mechanism within the ODE solver. We define an event function that monitors the maximum temperature in the domain, `event(t, y) = max(y) - Theta_th`. The solver is instructed to terminate the integration if this function crosses zero. If the integration terminates due to this event before reaching the specified maximum time $t_{max}$, we classify the outcome as blowup (`True`). Otherwise, if the integration completes to $t_{max}$, the solution is considered bounded (`False`).\n\n5.  **Numerical Safety**: To prevent floating-point overflow from the `exp` function when the solver probes large intermediate values of $\\theta$, the argument to the exponential is clipped at a value safely above the blowup threshold $\\Theta_{\\text{th}}$, ensuring this safety measure does not interfere with the detection logic.\n\nThe Python code in the final answer implements this scheme to determine the outcome for the given set of $\\delta$ values.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nfrom scipy.sparse import diags\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Frank-Kamenetskii equation for a 1D slab to detect thermal runaway.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Problem Parameters ---\n    N = 80  # Number of interior spatial grid points\n    t_max = 15.0  # Terminal integration time\n    Theta_th = 20.0  # Blowup detection threshold\n\n    # Test cases for the dimensionless heat-release parameter delta\n    delta_values = [0.85, 0.90, 1.00]\n\n    # --- Spatial Discretization ---\n    h = 1.0 / (N + 1)  # Grid spacing\n    x = np.linspace(h, 1.0 - h, N)  # Interior grid points\n\n    # Second-order finite difference matrix for the Laplacian (A/h^2)\n    # The matrix A itself is tridiagonal with diagonals (1, -2, 1)\n    # We pre-calculate the full matrix for the ODE system, A / h^2\n    diagonals = [np.ones(N - 1), -2 * np.ones(N), np.ones(N - 1)]\n    laplacian_matrix = diags(diagonals, [-1, 0, 1]).toarray() / (h**2)\n\n    # --- Initial Condition ---\n    theta_0 = 0.1 * np.sin(np.pi * x)\n\n    # --- ODE System and Event Definition ---\n\n    def rhs(t, y, delta, lap_mat):\n        \"\"\"\n        Right-hand side of the ODE system: d(theta)/dt = f(t, theta).\n        y corresponds to the vector of temperatures theta.\n        \"\"\"\n        diffusion = lap_mat @ y\n        \n        # Numerical safety: clip the argument of exp to prevent overflow.\n        # The clip value (50.0) is well above Theta_th (20.0), so it does not\n        # interfere with the blowup detection logic.\n        reaction = delta * np.exp(np.clip(y, None, 50.0))\n        \n        return diffusion + reaction\n\n    def check_blowup(t, y, delta, lap_mat):\n        \"\"\"\n        Event function for solve_ivp.
