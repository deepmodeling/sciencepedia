Determine the recommended solver tolerances and time steps $(\\mathrm{rtol}, \\mathrm{atol}, \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{init}}, \\Delta t_{\\max})$ based on the provided rules.\n\nWe will use the following constants:\n- Universal gas constant: $R_u = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n- Standard atmospheric pressure: $1\\,\\mathrm{atm} = 101325\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n- Mole fractions for stoichiometric mixture: $x_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 2/3$, $x_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 1/3$.\n- Wall-loss parameters: $D_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at $P_0 = 101325\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nLet us detail the calculation for a general case $(T, P, L)$.\n\n**Step 1: Concentrations**\nThe total molar concentration, which is also the third-body concentration $[\\mathrm{M}]$, is given by the Ideal Gas Law:\n$$[\\mathrm{M}] = c_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{P}{R_u T}$$\nThe bulk reactant concentrations are then:\n$$[\\mathrm{H}_2] = x_{\\mathrm{H}_2} c_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{P}{R_u T}$$\n$$[\\mathrm{O}_2] = x_{\\mathrm{O}_2} c_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{P}{R_u T}$$\n\n**Step 2: Rate Constants**\nThe rate constants are evaluated at the given temperature $T$:\n$k_1(T) = A_1 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_1}{R_u T}\\right)$ with $A_1 = 1.04 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $E_1/R_u = 15000\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$k_2(T) = 1.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$k_3(T) = 2.0 \\times 10^6 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4000}{T}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$k_4(T) = k_{4,\\mathrm{ref}}\\,\\frac{300}{T}$ with $k_{4,\\mathrm{ref}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{m}^6\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$k_5(T) = 1.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$k_6(T) = 1.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\n**Step 3: Wall-Loss Coefficient**\nThe wall-loss rate coefficient $k_w$ for radicals $\\mathrm{H}$, $\\mathrm{O}$, and $\\mathrm{OH}$ is modeled to be inversely proportional to pressure, reflecting the increase in mean free path at lower pressures which enhances diffusion to the walls.\n$$k_w(P,L) = \\frac{D_0}{L^2} \\frac{P_0}{P}$$\n\n**Step 4: Stiffness Timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{fast}}$**\nThe stiffness of the ODE system is governed by the fastest reactions. The timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{fast}}$ is the inverse of the maximum pseudo-first-order rate among several key radical consumption pathways in the radical-free limit. This value indicates the smallest time step an explicit numerical integrator could take without becoming unstable.\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{fast}} = \\left(\\max\\left\\{k_2(T)\\,[\\mathrm{H}_2] + k_w,\\; k_3(T)\\,[\\mathrm{H}_2] + k_w,\\; k_1(T)\\,[\\mathrm{O}_2] + k_4(T)\\,[\\mathrm{O}_2]\\,[\\mathrm{M}] + k_w\\right\\}\\right)^{-1}$$\nThe three terms in the $\\max$ function correspond to the consumption rates of radicals $\\mathrm{O}$, $\\mathrm{OH}$, and $\\mathrm{H}$, respectively.\n\n**Step 5: Net Growth Rate $\\lambda$**\nThe quantity $\\lambda$ is the net branching factor, which determines whether the total radical concentration will grow (explosion, $\\lambda > 0$) or decay (slow reaction, $\\lambda < 0$). It is the difference between the primary chain-branching rate ($R1$) and the primary termination rates (wall loss of $\\mathrm{H}$ and third-body reaction $R4$). The condition $\\lambda = 0$ defines the first and second explosion limits.\n$$\\lambda = \\underbrace{k_1(T)[\\mathrm{O}_2]}_{\\text{Branching}} - \\underbrace{\\left(k_4(T)[\\mathrm{O}_2][\\mathrm{M}] + k_w\\right)}_{\\text{Termination}}$$\n\n**Step 6: Solver Parameters**\nThe solver parameters are determined based on the values of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{fast}}$ and $\\lambda$.\n- Relative tolerance: $\\mathrm{rtol} = 10^{-8}$.\n- Absolute tolerance: $\\mathrm{atol} = 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n- Initial step size: $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{init}} = 0.02\\,\\tau_{\\mathrm{fast}}$. This ensures the initial step is small enough to resolve the fastest dynamics.\n- Maximum step size: The logic for $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ depends on the sign of $\\lambda$.\n  - If $\\lambda > 0$ (explosive regime), the step size must be limited to resolve the exponential growth timescale, $1/\\lambda$. A safety factor is included: $\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\min(0.05, 0.1/\\lambda)$.\n  - If $\\lambda \\le 0$ (non-explosive regime), the growth is not self-accelerating. The step size is limited by the overall reaction rate and a practical upper bound: $\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\min(0.05, 5 / (k_1(T)[\\mathrm{O}_2] + k_4(T)[\\mathrm{O}_2][\\mathrm{M}] + k_w))$.\n\nWe now apply this procedure to the four specified test cases.
