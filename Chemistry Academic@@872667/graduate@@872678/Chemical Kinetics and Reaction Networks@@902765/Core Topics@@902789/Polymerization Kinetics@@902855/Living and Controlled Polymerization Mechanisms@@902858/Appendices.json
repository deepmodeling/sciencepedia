It presents a standard, albeit simplified, kinetic model of Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP). The givens are self-contained and consistent, describing an idealized scenario commonly used for fundamental analysis in polymer chemistry. All terms are defined, and the objectives are clear. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we shall proceed with its formal solution.\n\nThe problem is solved in three parts: first, the derivation of the time $t$ to reach a target degree of polymerization $X_{\\mathrm{target}}$; second, the derivation of the fractional loss of chains $\\phi$ and the condition for this loss to be negligible; and third, the calculation of the number-average molar mass $M_n$ and dispersity $Đ$ under the condition of negligible termination.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of polymerization time $t$\n\nThe rate of monomer consumption is given by the propagation rate law:\n$$\n\\frac{d[M]}{dt} = -k_p [M] [P\\cdot]\n$$\nwhere $[M]$ is the monomer concentration, $[P\\cdot]$ is the concentration of active polymer chains (radicals), and $k_p$ is the propagation rate constant.\n\nThe problem specifies a rapid activation-deactivation equilibrium, described by an effective, time-invariant equilibrium constant $K_{ATRP}$:\n$$\n\\frac{[P\\cdot]}{[P\\text{-}X]} = K_{ATRP}\n$$\nwhere $[P\\text{-}X]$ is the concentration of dormant polymer chains. The total concentration of chains, $[C]$, is the sum of active and dormant species: $[C] = [P\\text{-}X] + [P\\cdot]$. Solving for $[P\\cdot]$ gives $[P\\cdot] = K_{ATRP} [P\\text{-}X]$. Substituting this into the sum gives $[C] = [P\\text{-}X](1+K_{ATRP})$.\nTherefore, $[P\\cdot] = \\frac{K_{ATRP}}{1+K_{ATRP}} [C]$.\n\nA key feature of a well-controlled, \"living\" polymerization is the suppression of termination reactions. As a first approximation, which we will validate in Part 2, we assume termination is negligible. Under this assumption, the total number of chains remains constant and equal to the initial concentration of the initiator, $[P\\text{-}X]_0$. Thus, $[C](t) \\approx [P\\text{-}X]_0$.\nThe radical concentration can then be expressed as:\n$$\n[P\\cdot] \\approx \\frac{K_{ATRP}}{1+K_{ATRP}} [P\\text{-}X]_0\n$$\nThe problem also states that $[P\\cdot] \\ll [P\\text{-}X]$, which implies $K_{ATRP} \\ll 1$. Consequently, the denominator $(1+K_{ATRP}) \\approx 1$, leading to the simplification:\n$$\n[P\\cdot] \\approx K_{ATRP} [P\\text{-}X]_0\n$$\nThis shows that the active radical concentration is approximately constant throughout the polymerization, a characteristic feature of this idealized ATRP model.\n\nSubstituting this constant radical concentration into the monomer consumption rate law yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d[M]}{dt} \\approx -k_p K_{ATRP} [P\\text{-}X]_0 [M]\n$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for $[M]$. We solve it by separating variables and integrating from the initial conditions ($t=0$, $[M]=[M]_0$) to a time $t$ and concentration $[M](t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{[M]_0}^{[M](t)} \\frac{d[M]}{[M]} = - \\int_0^t k_p K_{ATRP} [P\\text{-}X]_0 d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{[M](t)}{[M]_0}\\right) = - (k_p K_{ATRP} [P\\text{-}X]_0) t\n$$\nThe target number-average degree of polymerization, $X_{\\mathrm{target}}$, is defined as the number of monomer units consumed per initial chain:\n$$\nX_{\\mathrm{target}} = \\frac{[M]_0 - [M](t)}{[P\\text{-}X]_0}\n$$\nFrom this definition, we express the monomer concentration $[M](t)$ at the target point:\n$$\n[M](t) = [M]_0 - X_{\\mathrm{target}} [P\\text{-}X]_0\n$$\nThe ratio $[M](t)/[M]_0$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{[M](t)}{[M]_0} = 1 - \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{target}} [P\\text{-}X]_0}{[M]_0}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the integrated rate law:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{target}} [P\\text{-}X]_0}{[M]_0}\\right) = - (k_p K_{ATRP} [P\\text{-}X]_0) t\n$$\nSolving for the time $t$ gives the final expression:\n$$\nt = - \\frac{\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{target}} [P\\text{-}X]_0}{[M]_0}\\right)}{k_p K_{ATRP} [P\\text{-}X]_0}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Fractional loss of chains $\\phi$\n\nWe now verify the validity of our assumption of negligible termination. Termination occurs by the bimolecular combination of two active chains, with rate constant $k_t$. The rate of termination events is $R_t = k_t [P\\cdot]^2$. Each combination event reduces the total number of chains by one. The rate of change of the total chain concentration $[C]$ is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = -R_t = -k_t [P\\cdot]^2\n$$\nThe total number of chains lost up to time $t$, $\\Delta [C]$, is the integral of this rate:\n$$\n\\Delta [C] = \\int_0^t k_t [P\\cdot](\\tau)^2 d\\tau\n$$\nThe fractional loss of chains, $\\phi$, is the ratio of chains lost to the initial number of chains:\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{\\Delta [C]}{[P\\text{-}X]_0} = \\frac{1}{[P\\text{-}X]_0} \\int_0^t k_t [P\\cdot](\\tau)^2 d\\tau\n$$\nUsing the same approximation as in Part 1, $[P\\cdot] \\approx K_{ATRP} [P\\text{-}X]_0$, which is treated as a constant:\n$$\n\\phi \\approx \\frac{1}{[P\\text{-}X]_0} \\int_0^t k_t (K_{ATRP} [P\\text{-}X]_0)^2 d\\tau = \\frac{k_t (K_{ATRP} [P\\text{-}X]_0)^2}{[P\\text{-}X]_0} \\int_0^t d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\phi \\approx k_t K_{ATRP}^2 [P\\text{-}X]_0 t\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the time $t$ required to reach $X_{\\mathrm{target}}$:\n$$\n\\phi \\approx k_t K_{ATRP}^2 [P\\text{-}X]_0 \\left( - \\frac{\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{target}} [P\\text{-}X]_0}{[M]_0}\\right)}{k_p K_{ATRP} [P\\text{-}X]_0} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the fractional loss of chains:\n$$\n\\phi \\approx - \\frac{k_t K_{ATRP}}{k_p} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{target}} [P\\text{-}X]_0}{[M]_0}\\right)\n$$\nThe assumption of negligible termination is justified if this fractional loss is much less than unity, i.e., the condition is $\\phi \\ll 1$.\n\nPart 3: Derivation of $M_n$ and $Đ$\n\nWe now operate under the regime where termination is negligible, as per the condition $\\phi \\ll 1$. This scenario conforms to an ideal living polymerization with the following characteristics given in the problem:\n1.  Instantaneous and quantitative initiation: all chains begin growing at $t=0$.\n2.  Negligible termination: the number of growing chains is constant.\n3.  Rapid exchange limit: all chains have an equal time-averaged probability of propagation.\n\nThese are the precise conditions under which the number of monomer units per chain, i.e., the degree of polymerization $X$, follows a Poisson distribution. The number-average degree of polymerization, $X_n$, is the mean of this distribution. By its definition in the problem, at the target point, $X_n = X_{\\mathrm{target}}$.\n\nThe number-average molar mass, $M_n$, is the total mass of the polymer divided by the total number of moles of polymer chains.

It is equivalent to the ratio of the weight-average degree of polymerization, $X_w$, to the number-average degree of polymerization, $X_n$.\n$$\nĐ = \\frac{M_w}{M_n} = \\frac{X_w}{X_n}\n$$\nFor a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = X_n$, the second moment (mean square) of the distribution is $E[X^2] = \\lambda^2 + \\lambda = X_n^2 + X_n$.\nThe weight-average degree of polymerization is defined as:\n$$\nX_w = \\frac{\\sum_i X_i^2 N_i}{\\sum_i X_i N_i} = \\frac{E[X^2]}{E[X]} = \\frac{X_n^2 + X_n}{X_n} = X_n + 1\n$$\nTherefore, the dispersity $Đ$ is:\n$$\nĐ = \\frac{X_n + 1}{X_n} = 1 + \\frac{1}{X_n}\n$$\nAt the target conversion, we substitute $X_n = X_{\\mathrm{target}}$ to obtain the dispersity:\n$$\nĐ = 1 + \\frac{1}{X_{\\mathrm{target}}}\n$$\nThe final answer consists of the expressions for $M_n$ and $Đ$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nM_{\\mathrm{ini}} + X_{\\mathrm{target}} M_M  1 + \\frac{1}{X_{\\mathrm{target}}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2653785"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theory to practice, this exercise demonstrates how to diagnose the performance of a real-world polymerization.

This requires a systematic calculation of theoretical benchmarks and their comparison with experimental data.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical number-average degree of polymerization, $X_{n}$, as a function of fractional monomer conversion, $p$. The conversion is defined as $p = ([\\mathrm{M}]_{0} - [\\mathrm{M}]) / [\\mathrm{M}]_{0}$, where $[\\mathrm{M}]_{0}$ is the initial monomer concentration and $[\\mathrm{M}]$ is the concentration at a given time.

Let $t_f$ be the time required to reach a fixed target number-average molecular weight $M_n^\\ast$ that corresponds to a fixed target number-average degree of polymerization $X_n^\\ast$ for the living chains.\n\nWork within the following physically motivated and scientifically standard approximations for controlled radical polymerization in the persistent radical regime:\n- The quasi-steady-state approximation holds for the radical concentration, and the exchange between $D$ and $A$ is much faster than changes in $[M]$, so that $[A]/[D] \\approx \\left(k_a[\\mathrm{Cu(I)}]\\right)/\\left(k_d[\\mathrm{Cu(II)}]\\right)$, with $[D] \\approx C_{P,0}$, the initial concentration of living chain ends (assume $C_{P,0} = [I]_0$).\n- The copper complex concentrations $[\\mathrm{Cu(I)}]$ and $[\\mathrm{Cu(II)}]$ remain effectively constant over $[0,t_f]$ due to a large reservoir and persistent radical effect.\n- The monomer concentration is slowly varying over $[0,t_f]$ and can be replaced by an effective constant $[M]_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for estimating dispersity contributions from exchange kinetics.\n- Termination is small but nonzero, and its contribution to the dispersity is linear in the fraction of chains lost to termination, with a proportionality constant $c_{\\mathrm{term}}$ of order unity that depends weakly on conversion and mechanism details.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the dispersity $Đ \\equiv M_w/M_n$ at time $t_f$ can be approximated as the sum of three contributions: the ideal living term arising from the propagation birth process, an exchange-kinetics broadening term due to finite deactivation rate relative to propagation, and a termination-induced broadening term. Using only the law of mass action, the Arrhenius dependence of the rate constants, and standard properties of Poisson and geometric processes for activation–deactivation cycles under quasi-steady exchange, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the temperature $T^\\ast$ that minimizes $Đ$ for the fixed target $X_n^\\ast$ (equivalently $M_n^\\ast$). Your final expression must be written entirely in terms of the Arrhenius parameters $\\{A_i,E_i\\}$, the constant concentrations $[\\mathrm{Cu(I)}]$, $[\\mathrm{Cu(II)}]$, $[M]_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the logarithmic conversion factor $Q \\equiv \\ln\\!\\left([M]_0/[M]_f\\right)$ with $[M]_f$ the monomer concentration at $t_f$, the target degree of polymerization $X_n^\\ast$, the universal gas constant $R$, and the dimensionless constant $c_{\\mathrm{term}}$.

The dispersity is a function of temperature, $Đ(T)$, through the Arrhenius dependence of the rate constants.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the dispersity $Đ$ is the sum of three contributions:\n$$Đ(T) = Đ_{\\mathrm{ideal}} + Đ_{\\mathrm{exchange}}(T) + Đ_{\\mathrm{term}}(T)$$\nThe ideal living term, for a chain growth process leading to a Poisson-like distribution, is $Đ_{\\mathrm{ideal}} = 1 + \\frac{1}{X_n^\\ast}$. As $X_n^\\ast$ is a fixed target, this term is a constant with respect to temperature and does not affect the location of the minimum. We therefore seek to minimize the temperature-dependent part of the dispersity, $\\Delta Đ(T) = Đ_{\\mathrm{exchange}}(T) + Đ_{\\mathrm{term}}(T)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the explicit forms for $Đ_{\\mathrm{exchange}}(T)$ and $Đ_{\\mathrm{term}}(T)$.\n\nThe exchange contribution to dispersity, $Đ_{\\mathrm{exchange}}$, arises from the finite rate of deactivation of active radical chains relative to propagation. A standard result, consistent with the problem's provision of an effective monomer concentration $[M]_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for this purpose, is given by the ratio of the average number of monomers added per activation event to the total degree of polymerization:\n$$Đ_{\\mathrm{exchange}} = \\frac{\\langle\\nu\\rangle}{X_n^\\ast} = \\frac{k_p [M]_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{k_d [\\mathrm{Cu(II)}]} \\frac{1}{X_n^\\ast}$$\nHere, $k_p$ is the propagation rate constant and $k_d$ is the deactivation rate constant.\n\nThe termination contribution, $Đ_{\\mathrm{term}}$, is stated to be linear in the fraction of chains lost to termination, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{term}}$, with a proportionality constant $c_{\\mathrm{term}}$.\n$$Đ_{\\mathrm{term}} = c_{\\mathrm{term}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{term}}$$\nThe fraction of terminated chains is the concentration of chains lost to bimolecular termination, divided by the initial concentration of chains, $[I]_0$. The rate of termination events is $R_t = k_t [A]^2$, where $[A]$ is the concentration of active radical chains. Each termination event removes two chains. The concentration of chains lost is therefore $2 \\times \\int_0^{t_f} \\frac{1}{2} R_t dt = \\int_0^{t_f} k_t [A]^2 dt$.
