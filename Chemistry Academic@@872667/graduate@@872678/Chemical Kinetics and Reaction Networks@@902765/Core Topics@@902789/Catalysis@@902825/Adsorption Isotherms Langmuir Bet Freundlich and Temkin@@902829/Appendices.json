A negative intercept in the standard Brunauer–Emmett–Teller linear plot is unphysical because it implies a negative BET constant even though, by its statistical–thermodynamic definition in terms of adsorption and liquefaction energies, that constant must be strictly positive. This likely reflects an invalid fitting range or data artifacts.\n\nB. The most common cause is selection of a pressure interval that violates the applicability of the BET approximation (e.g., inclusion of micropore filling or the onset of capillary condensation). One should restrict the fit to a range that satisfies accepted criteria for BET applicability (such as the Rouquerol criteria), yielding a positive intercept and a meaningful monolayer capacity.\n\nC. For microporous or strongly heterogeneous adsorbents, one should not apply BET naively to the raw isotherm. Instead, use methods such as the thickness-plot (t-plot), Dubinin–Radushkevich analysis, or non-local density functional theory to quantify micropore filling and external surface; only then, if justified, apply BET on the external-surface segment or otherwise adopt a more appropriate model.\n\nD.

Let us analyze the physical implications. The intercept is given by:\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{V_m C} $$\nThe monolayer capacity, $V_m$, represents the volume of gas required to form a complete single layer of molecules on the adsorbent surface. As a physical quantity representing an amount, it must be positive, $V_m > 0$.\nGiven that $V_m > 0$, for the intercept $I$ to be negative, the BET constant $C$ must be negative ($C  0$). However, as established from its statistical-thermodynamic definition, $C$ must be strictly positive. A negative value for $C$ is therefore a physical absurdity.\n\nConclusion: A negative intercept in the standard BET linear plot is fundamentally inconsistent with the physical principles of the BET model. It is an artifact indicating that one or more of the model's core assumptions are severely violated by the experimental system, or that the model has been applied to data from an inappropriate relative pressure range. The problem describes a \"steep uptake at low relative pressure\" approaching a plateau, which is characteristic of a Type I isotherm, commonly observed for microporous materials. The BET model is not designed for micropore filling, where adsorption is enhanced by overlapping potential fields from pore walls and limited by pore volume, rather than multilayer formation on an open surface. Applying the BET equation to such a system is a common cause for obtaining unphysical results like a negative intercept.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement.\n\nA. A negative intercept in the standard Brunauer–Emmett–Teller linear plot is unphysical because it implies a negative BET constant even though, by its statistical–thermodynamic definition in terms of adsorption and liquefaction energies, that constant must be strictly positive. This likely reflects an invalid fitting range or data artifacts.\nThis statement is perfectly aligned with our derivation. A negative intercept $I = 1/(V_m C)$ indeed requires a negative $C$ (given $V_m > 0$), which is unphysical as $C \\approx \\exp((E_1 - E_L)/RT) > 0$. It correctly identifies the contradiction with the model's first principles and points to common causes like an invalid fitting range.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. The most common cause is selection of a pressure interval that violates the applicability of the BET approximation (e.g., inclusion of micropore filling or the onset of capillary condensation). One should restrict the fit to a range that satisfies accepted criteria for BET applicability (such as the Rouquerol criteria), yielding a positive intercept and a meaningful monolayer capacity.\nThis statement correctly identifies the primary reason for a negative intercept in the context of the problem description (microporous solid). Micropore filling, which dominates at low $p/p_0$ for Type I isotherms, violates the BET assumptions. The Rouquerol criteria, especially the one requiring that the function $V(1-p/p_0)$ increases monotonically with $p/p_0$, are designed to identify a mathematically consistent linear range, which is a necessary (though not always sufficient) condition for a valid BET analysis. This is a sound corrective action.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nC. For microporous or strongly heterogeneous adsorbents, one should not apply BET naively to the raw isotherm. Instead, use methods such as the thickness-plot (t-plot), Dubinin–Radushkevich analysis, or non-local density functional theory to quantify micropore filling and external surface; only then, if justified, apply BET on the external-surface segment or otherwise adopt a more appropriate model.\nThis statement provides the most comprehensive and scientifically sound advice. Since the isotherm shape suggests a microporous material, the BET model is fundamentally inappropriate for determining total surface area. The listed methods are the correct tools for such systems: the t-plot method separates micropore adsorption from external surface adsorption, the Dubinin–Radushkevich (DR) model describes micropore filling, and non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) provides a much more advanced and accurate description of adsorption in porous structures. This represents best practice in materials characterization.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nD. The intercept can be made positive by forcing the regression through the origin or by allowing a negative monolayer capacity, and since the monolayer capacity is just a fitting parameter this adjustment is acceptable.\nThis statement proposes unscientific and unacceptable data manipulation. Forcing the intercept to be zero ($I=0$) implies an infinite $C$ constant ($C \\to \\infty$), which is unphysical. Allowing a negative monolayer capacity ($V_m  0$) is likewise a physical absurdity. Physical parameters in a model are not arbitrary; they must retain their physical meaning. This approach constitutes a falsification of the analysis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nE. Using the desorption branch and extending the linear fit up to $p/p_0 \\approx 0.9$ will typically recover a positive intercept because more data at high relative pressure stabilize the regression.\nThis is poor advice. The adsorption branch is the standard for BET analysis to avoid complications from hysteresis, which is often present. The BET model is invalid at high relative pressures ($p/p_0 > 0.35$) where capillary condensation dominates over the assumed multilayer adsorption mechanism. Extending the fit to $p/p_0 \\approx 0.9$ incorporates data that grossly violate the model's assumptions, rendering the entire fit meaningless.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nF. Before refitting, verify and correct experimental artifacts: ensure accurate $\\,p_0$ determination and drift correction, adequate outgassing and degassing, leak and buoyancy corrections, and use of the adsorption branch before hysteresis; remove points known to be affected by instrument drift or capillary condensation.\nThis statement outlines essential prerequisites for any reliable adsorption data analysis. The quality of any model's output is limited by the quality of the input data. Experimental errors such as an incorrect $p_0$ value, instrument leaks, or incomplete sample preparation can severely distort the isotherm and lead to analytical artifacts. Ensuring data integrity is the first and most crucial step, preceding any theoretical modeling.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nG. A negative intercept is expected whenever the BET constant is less than $\\,1$, as in International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Type III isotherms; therefore a negative intercept can be physically meaningful for weak adsorbate–surface interactions.\nThis statement is factually incorrect. A Type III isotherm arises from weak adsorbate-surface interactions, corresponding to $0  C \\le 2$. If $0  C  1$, the intercept $I = 1/(V_m C)$ is positive, while the slope $S = (C-1)/(V_m C)$ is negative. A negative intercept is never a characteristic of a Type III isotherm within the BET framework. The statement incorrectly concludes that a negative intercept can be physically meaningful.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nH. If the system exhibits essentially monolayer adsorption without multilayer formation, replacing Brunauer–Emmett–Teller with single-site Langmuir or heterogeneous models such as Freundlich or Temkin for the low-pressure regime is appropriate, rather than forcing a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller fit.\nThis presents a valid modeling alternative. The described Type I isotherm, with its plateau, signifies adsorption limited to a finite capacity. This physical behavior is the basis of the Langmuir model (for a uniform surface) and is also captured by micropore filling models. If the system's behavior is better described as monolayer formation or filling of a finite pore volume, it is scientifically correct to use a model that reflects this physics (like Langmuir, Freundlich, or Temkin) rather than forcing a fit with the inappropriate multilayer BET model.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCFH}$$", "id": "2625968"}]}
