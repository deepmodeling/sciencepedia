It is a valid theoretical problem in chemical kinetics. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe rate of the bimolecular Langmuir–Hinshelwood reaction, $r$, is determined by the surface reaction step:\n$$r = k \\, \\theta_A \\theta_B$$\nwhere $k$ is the rate constant for the surface reaction, and $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ are the surface coverages of adsorbed species $A*$ and $B*$.\n\nThe rate constant $k$ is given by Transition State Theory, and its dependence on the descriptor $\\Delta$ is governed by the BEP relation:\n$k(\\Delta) \\propto \\exp(-\\beta G^\\ddagger(\\Delta)) = \\exp(-\\beta(G^\\ddagger_0 + \\alpha \\Delta G_{\\text{sr}}(\\Delta)))$.\nSubstituting $\\Delta G_{\\text{sr}}(\\Delta) = C - \\Delta G_A - \\Delta G_B$:\n$k(\\Delta) \\propto \\exp(-\\beta(G^\\ddagger_0 + \\alpha(C - \\Delta G_A - \\Delta G_B))) \\propto \\exp(\\beta\\alpha(\\Delta G_A + \\Delta G_B))$.\nThe terms independent of $\\Delta$ are absorbed into a proportionality constant.\n\nThe surface coverages $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ are derived from the Langmuir model under quasi-equilibrium conditions. The site balance is $\\theta_* + \\theta_A + \\theta_B = 1$, where $\\theta_A = K_A p_A \\theta_*$ and $\\theta_B = K_B p_B \\theta_*$. Solving for the coverages gives:\n$$\\theta_A = \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B}$$\n$$\\theta_B = \\frac{K_B p_B}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B}$$\n\nCombining these expressions, the rate $r$ is:\n$$r \\propto \\exp(\\beta\\alpha(\\Delta G_A + \\Delta G_B)) \\cdot \\frac{K_A p_A}{(1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B)} \\cdot \\frac{K_B p_B}{(1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B)}$$\nSubstituting $K_A = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_A)$ and $K_B = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_B)$:\n$$r \\propto p_A p_B \\frac{\\exp(\\beta\\alpha(\\Delta G_A + \\Delta G_B)) \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_A) \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_B)}{(1 + p_A \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_A) + p_B \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_B))^2}$$\nThe exponential terms in the numerator combine to $\\exp(-\\beta(1-\\alpha)(\\Delta G_A + \\Delta G_B))$.\n\nNow, we introduce the single descriptor $\\Delta$ using the given linear scaling relations: $\\Delta G_A = \\Delta$ and $\\Delta G_B = 2\\Delta$. Thus, $\\Delta G_A + \\Delta G_B = 3\\Delta$. The rate expression becomes a function of $\\Delta$:\n$$r(\\Delta) \\propto \\frac{\\exp(-3\\beta(1-\\alpha)\\Delta)}{(1 + p_A \\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) + p_B \\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta))^2}$$\nTo find the value of $\\Delta$ that maximizes the rate, $\\Delta_{\\text{opt}}$, we find the extremum by setting the derivative of the logarithm of $r(\\Delta)$ with respect to $\\Delta$ to zero.\n$$\\ln(r(\\Delta)) = \\text{const} - 3\\beta(1-\\alpha)\\Delta - 2\\ln(1 + p_A \\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) + p_B \\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta))$$\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln r)}{d\\Delta} = -3\\beta(1-\\alpha) - 2 \\frac{-p_A\\beta\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) - 2p_B\\beta\\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)}{1 + p_A \\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) + p_B \\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)} = 0$$\nDividing by $\\beta$ (which is non-zero) and rearranging gives the optimality condition:\n$$3(1-\\alpha) = 2 \\frac{p_A \\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) + 2p_B \\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)}{1 + p_A \\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) + p_B \\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)}$$\nLet $x = \\exp(-\\beta\\Delta)$. The equation becomes:\n$$3(1-\\alpha)(1 + p_A x + p_B x^2) = 2(p_A x + 2p_B x^2)$$\nThis rearranges into a quadratic equation for $x$:\n$$[4p_B - 3(1-\\alpha)p_B]x^2 + [2p_A - 3(1-\\alpha)p_A]x - 3(1-\\alpha) = 0$$\n$$(1+3\\alpha)p_B x^2 + (3\\alpha-1)p_A x - 3(1-\\alpha) = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with $a = (1+3\\alpha)p_B$, $b = (3\\alpha-1)p_A$, and $c = -3(1-\\alpha)$.\nThe physically meaningful solution for $x = \\exp(-\\beta\\Delta)$ must be positive. Since $a>0$, $c<0$, the product $ac$ is negative, which guarantees two real roots of opposite sign. We must take the positive root:\n$$x = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n$$x = \\frac{-(3\\alpha-1)p_A + \\sqrt{((3\\alpha-1)p_A)^2 - 4((1+3\\alpha)p_B)(-3(1-\\alpha))}}{2(1+3\\alpha)p_B}$$\n$$x = \\frac{(1-3\\alpha)p_A + \\sqrt{(1-3\\alpha)^2 p_A^2 + 12(1-\\alpha)(1+3\\alpha)p_B}}{2(1+3\\alpha)p_B}$$\nThe optimal descriptor is then $\\Delta G_{\\text{ads,opt}} = \\Delta_{\\text{opt}} = -\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\ln(x) = -RT\\ln(x)$.\nSubstituting the expression for $x$ gives the final analytical result for $\\Delta G_{\\text{ads,opt}}$.\n\n### Qualitative Analysis of Pressure Ratio Effect\nThe question requires an explanation of how the ratio $\\rho = p_A/p_B$ shifts the volcano apex, $\\Delta G_{\\text{ads,opt}}$. We analyze the derivative of $\\Delta G_{\\text{ads,opt}}$ with respect to $\\rho$. The sign of this derivative is opposite to the sign of the derivative of $x$ with respect to $\\rho$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\rho} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho} \\left[ \\frac{(1-3\\alpha)\\rho + \\sqrt{(1-3\\alpha)^2 \\rho^2 + \\frac{12(1-\\alpha)(1+3\\alpha)}{p_B}}}{2(1+3\\alpha)} \\right]$$\nThe derivative can be shown to have the same sign as the term $(1-3\\alpha)$.\nTherefore, the sign of $\\frac{\\partial \\Delta G_{\\text{ads,opt}}}{\\partial \\rho}$ is the same as the sign of $-(1-3\\alpha) = (3\\alpha-1)$.\n1.  If $\\alpha > 1/3$, then $3\\alpha-1 > 0$. An increase in the pressure ratio $p_A/p_B$ leads to an increase in $\\Delta G_{\\text{ads,opt}}$ (weaker optimal binding). The catalyst becomes more tolerant to weaker adsorption.\n2.  If $\\alpha < 1/3$, then $3\\alpha-1 < 0$. An increase in the pressure ratio $p_A/p_B$ leads to a decrease in $\\Delta G_{\\text{ads,opt}}$ (stronger optimal binding). The optimal catalyst must bind the reactants more strongly.\n3.  If $\\alpha = 1/3$, the optimal descriptor $\\Delta G_{\\text{ads,opt}}$ becomes independent of the pressure ratio $\\rho$, though it still depends on the absolute pressure $p_B$.\n\nThis behavior reflects the trade-off between surface reaction activation (favored by stronger binding) and site availability (favored by weaker binding), with the BEP coefficient $\\alpha$ controlling the sensitivity of the activation barrier to binding strength. The instruction about expressing the final energy in $\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$ is noted, but for a symbolic answer, this would require adding a numerical factor of $1/1000$, which is inappropriate.

Mean Optimal Energy, $\\mu$**\nThe optimal binding energy $E_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is found by maximizing the rate expression $\\ln r(E) = c + a E^2 + b E$. The maximum occurs where the derivative with respect to $E$ is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dE} \\ln r(E) = 2aE + b = 0 \\implies E_{\\mathrm{opt}} = -\\frac{b}{2a}\n$$\nSubstituting the linear dependencies $a = \\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ and $b = \\mathbf{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, we obtain:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{opt}}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = -\\frac{\\mathbf{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}}{2 (\\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})}\n$$\nThe first-order approximation of the mean of $E_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is its value at the mean of the inputs, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0$:\n$$\n\\mu = E_{\\mathrm{opt}}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0) = -\\frac{\\mathbf{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0}{2 (\\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0)}\n$$\n\n**2. Variance of Optimal Binding Energy, $\\sigma^2$**\nThe variance is approximated by the delta method formula, $\\sigma^2 \\approx \\mathbf{J} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{J}^{\\top}$. The crucial component is the Jacobian row vector $\\mathbf{J} = \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} E_{\\mathrm{opt}}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})|_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0}$. We find the partial derivative of $E_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ with respect to each component $\\beta_i$ using the quotient rule on $E_{\\mathrm{opt}}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = -N(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) / D(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$, where $N(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\mathbf{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ and $D(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = 2(\\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_{\\mathrm{opt}}}{\\partial \\beta_i} = - \\frac{\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial \\beta_i} D(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) - N(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial \\beta_i}}{[D(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})]^2}\n$$\nThe derivatives of $N$ and $D$ are simply $\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial \\beta_i} = v_i$ and $\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial \\beta_i} = 2u_i$. Substituting these yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_{\\mathrm{opt}}}{\\partial \\beta_i} = - \\frac{v_i (2 \\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) - (\\mathbf{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) (2u_i)}{[2(\\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})]^2} = \\frac{2 u_i (\\mathbf{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) - 2 v_i (\\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})}{4 (\\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^2} = \\frac{u_i (\\mathbf{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) - v_i (\\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})}{2 (\\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^2}\n$$\nEvaluating at $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0$ and using the shorthand $a_0 = \\mathbf{u}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0$ and $b_0 = \\mathbf{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0$, the $i$-th component of the Jacobian is $J_i = (u_i b_0 - v_i a_0) / (2 a_0^2)$. The full Jacobian row vector is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{b_0 \\mathbf{u}^{\\top} - a_0 \\mathbf{v}^{\\top}}{2 a_0^2}\n$$\nThe covariance matrix is constructed from the givens: $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{D}$, with $\\mathbf{D} = \\mathrm{diag}(\\Delta_1/1.96, \\dots, \\Delta_p/1.96)$. The variance $\\sigma^2$ is then computed, and the standard deviation is $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}$.\n\n**3. Probability Calculation**\nWe are to compute $P(|E_{\\text{cand}} - E_{\\text{opt}}| \\le \\delta)$. This is equivalent to $P(E_{\\text{cand}} - \\delta \\le E_{\\text{opt}} \\le E_{\\text{cand}} + \\delta)$. With the approximation $E_{\\mathrm{opt}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, we standardize the interval bounds to $z_{lower} = (E_{\\text{cand}} - \\delta - \\mu)/\\sigma$ and $z_{upper} = (E_{\\text{cand}} + \\delta - \\mu)/\\sigma$. The probability is the difference between the values of the standard Normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), $\\Phi(z)$, at these bounds:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P} = \\Phi(z_{upper}) - \\Phi(z_{lower})\n$$\nThese derived formulas are implemented computationally for each test case.", "answer": "[[0.545455, 0.062078, 0.825103],[0.545455, 0.003314, 0.998014],[0.71, 0.024249, 0.999999],[0.532609, 0.264639, 0.291771]]", "id": "2688644"}]}
