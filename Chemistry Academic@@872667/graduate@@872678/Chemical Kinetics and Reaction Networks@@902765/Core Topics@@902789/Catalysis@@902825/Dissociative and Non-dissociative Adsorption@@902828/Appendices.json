This ratio, denoted as $R_{H}$, will be derived from first principles of chemical kinetics.\n\nFirst, we analyze the non-dissociative pathway for the species $X_2^*$. Let the surface coverage of this species be $\\theta_{m}(t)$, which is a dimensionless quantity representing the fraction of occupied sites. The desorption process is a first-order unimolecular reaction:\n$$ X_2^* \\xrightarrow{k_{dm}} X_2(g)+* $$\nThe rate of change of the molecular coverage $\\theta_{m}(t)$ for $t  0$ is governed by the law of mass action.

We must express the forward flux in terms of $P_{A_2}$ and $\\theta_*$.\n\n-   **LH Pathway**: The expression for the forward flux is already in the desired terms:\n    $$J_{\\mathrm{fwd, LH}} = k_{\\mathrm{LH}} P_{A_2} \\theta_*^2$$\n    The apparent reaction order with respect to $P_{A_2}$ is $1$, and the dependence on $\\theta_*$ is quadratic ($\\theta_*^2$).\n\n-   **ER Pathway**: The expression for the forward flux is $J_{\\mathrm{fwd, ER}} = k_{\\mathrm{ER}} P_{A_2} \\theta_A \\theta_*$. We must eliminate $\\theta_A$ using the site balance identity $\\theta_A = 1 - \\theta_*$:\n    $$J_{\\mathrm{fwd, ER}} = k_{\\mathrm{ER}} P_{A_2} (1 - \\theta_*) \\theta_*$$\n    The apparent reaction order with respect to $P_{A_2}$ is $1$, and the dependence on $\\theta_*$ is given by the function $\\theta_*(1-\\theta_*)$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Measuring the initial uptake rate as a function of precoverage $\\theta_{A,0}$ at fixed $P_{A_2}$ and $T$, the observation of a pronounced maximum at $\\theta_{A,0}\\approx 0.5$ indicates the Eley–Rideal pathway; dissociative adsorption shows no such maximum.**\nFrom Task 1, the initial rate for the LH pathway is $r_{0, \\mathrm{LH}} \\propto (1 - \\theta_{A,0})^2$. This function is monotonically decreasing for $\\theta_{A,0} \\in [0, 1)$ and shows no maximum in this domain. The initial rate for the ER pathway is $r_{0, \\mathrm{ER}} \\propto \\theta_{A,0}(1 - \\theta_{A,0})$. This is a parabolic function of $\\theta_{A,0}$, which is zero at $\\theta_{A,0}=0$ and $\\theta_{A,0}=1$ and has a maximum at $\\theta_{A,0} = 0.5$. The statement correctly identifies this distinct kinetic signature.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under a quasi-steady state set by balance with recombinative desorption, the forward flux is first order in $P_{A_2}$ for dissociative adsorption but three-halves order in $P_{A_2}$ for the Eley–Rideal pathway; thus pressure order discriminates between them.**\nThe apparent pressure order is not constant but depends on coverage (and thus on pressure itself). For LH, the apparent order of the steady state flux varies between $1$ (at low P) and $0$ (at high P). For ER, the apparent order varies between $2$ (at low P) and $0$ (at high P). Neither pathway exhibits a constant order under all conditions. Critically, the ER pathway model provided here does not yield an apparent order of $3/2$ under any general or limiting condition. The statement is factually incorrect based on the provided a priori models.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The dependence on vacancy fraction $\\theta_*$ is quadratic for both pathways at all $\\theta_A$, so coverage dependence cannot discriminate between them.**\nThis statement concerns the functional dependence of the forward flux on $\\theta_*$. From Task 2, $J_{\\mathrm{fwd, LH}} \\propto \\theta_*^2$, which is a quadratic dependence. However, $J_{\\mathrm{fwd, ER}} \\propto \\theta_*(1-\\theta_*)$, which is not a simple quadratic dependence on $\\theta_*$. The dependencies are demonstrably different. Therefore, the statement that the dependence is quadratic for both pathways is false, and the conclusion that coverage dependence cannot be used for discrimination is also false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Introducing a small amount of an inert site blocker that reduces $\\theta_*$ by a small increment $\\delta$ at fixed $\\theta_A$ lowers the initial uptake by a factor approximately $1-2\\delta$ for dissociative adsorption but by approximately $1-\\delta$ for the Eley–Rideal pathway; the linear sensitivity to $\\delta$ differentiates the mechanisms.**\nWe analyze the effect of a blocker on the initial uptake rate. The blocker consumes sites, so the fraction of vacant sites changes from $\\theta_*$ to $\\theta_*' = \\theta_* - \\delta$, where $\\delta$ is the coverage of the blocker.\n-   **LH Pathway**: The initial rate is $r_0 \\propto \\theta_*^2$. The new rate is $r'_0 \\propto (\\theta_* - \\delta)^2$. The ratio is $\\frac{r'_0}{r_0} = \\frac{(\\theta_* - \\delta)^2}{\\theta_*^2} = (1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\theta_*})^2 \\approx 1 - \\frac{2\\delta}{\\theta_*}$. If we consider the low precoverage limit where $\\theta_{A,0} \\approx 0$, then $\\theta_* \\approx 1$, and the reduction factor is approximately $1 - 2\\delta$.\n-   **ER Pathway**: The initial rate is $r_0 \\propto \\theta_A\\theta_*$. The new rate is $r'_0 \\propto \\theta_A(\\theta_* - \\delta)$. The ratio is $\\frac{r'_0}{r_0} = \\frac{\\theta_A(\\theta_* - \\delta)}{\\theta_A\\theta_*} = 1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\theta_*}$. In the limit $\\theta_* \\approx 1$, this factor is $1-\\delta$.\nThe rates exhibit different linear sensitivities to the blocker coverage $\\delta$. The statement correctly captures this essential physical difference.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Because both pathways involve $A_2(\\mathrm{g})$ and $A^*$, adding an inert site blocker that does not bind $A$ does not affect the Eley–Rideal rate, but it does suppress dissociative adsorption.**\nThis statement is patently false. The ER elementary step is $A_2(\\mathrm{g})+A^*+*\\rightarrow 2A^*$. This reaction explicitly requires a vacant site, $*$. An inert site blocker reduces the availability of these vacant sites (i.e., it decreases $\\theta_*$). Consequently, the rate of the ER pathway, $J_{\\mathrm{fwd, ER}} = k_{\\mathrm{ER}} P_{A_2} \\theta_A \\theta_*$, will be suppressed. Both pathways require vacant sites and are thus inhibited by site blockers.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2639984"}]}
