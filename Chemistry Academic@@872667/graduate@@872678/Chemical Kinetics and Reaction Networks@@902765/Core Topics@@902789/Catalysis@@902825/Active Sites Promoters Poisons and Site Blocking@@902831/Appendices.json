It represents a foundational derivation, not a trivial or pseudo-profound exercise (criterion 6).\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows.\nThe overall rate of reaction, $r$, is dictated by the rate of the designated rate-determining step (RDS). The RDS is the bimolecular surface reaction:\n$$\nA* + B* \\rightarrow P* + *\n$$\nAccording to the law of mass action applied to surface species, the forward rate of this elementary step is proportional to the product of the surface coverages of the reactants, $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$. The rate expression is therefore:\n$$\nr = k \\theta_A \\theta_B\n$$\nHere, $k$ is the rate constant for the surface reaction.\n\nThe problem states that the adsorption steps for reactants $A$ and $B$ are in quasi-equilibrium.\nFor the adsorption of $A(g)$:\n$$\nA(g) + * \\rightleftharpoons A*\n$$\nThe equilibrium is described by the equilibrium constant $K_A$. By definition, this constant relates the activities of the species involved. For an ideal gas and an ideal surface, this relationship is expressed in terms of partial pressure and fractional coverages:\n$$\nK_A = \\frac{\\theta_A}{p_A \\theta_*}\n$$\nwhere $p_A$ is the partial pressure of $A$ in the gas phase and $\\theta_*$ is the fraction of vacant active sites. From this equilibrium relationship, we can express the coverage of $A$ in terms of the vacant site coverage:\n$$\n\\theta_A = K_A p_A \\theta_*\n$$\nSimilarly, for the adsorption of $B(g)$:\n$$\nB(g) + * \\rightleftharpoons B*\n$$\nThe corresponding equilibrium relationship is:\n$$\nK_B = \\frac{\\theta_B}{p_B \\theta_*}\n$$\nwhich gives the coverage of $B$ as:\n$$\n\\theta_B = K_B p_B \\theta_*\n$$\nNow we can substitute these expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ into the rate equation. This yields the rate expression in terms of $\\theta_*$, as requested in the first part of the problem.\n$$\nr = k (K_A p_A \\theta_*) (K_B p_B \\theta_*) = k K_A K_B p_A p_B \\theta_*^2\n$$\nTo obtain a final closed-form expression, we must eliminate $\\theta_*$ from the rate equation. This requires a site balance. The total fraction of active sites must sum to $1$. The sites are partitioned among vacant sites ($*$), sites occupied by $A$ ($A*$), and sites occupied by $B$ ($B*$). The problem states that the coverage of the product intermediate, $\\theta_{P*}$, is negligible. Therefore, the site balance equation is:\n$$\n\\theta_* + \\theta_A + \\theta_B = 1\n$$\nWe substitute the equilibrium expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ into the site balance equation:\n$$\n\\theta_* + (K_A p_A \\theta_*) + (K_B p_B \\theta_*) = 1\n$$\nFactoring out $\\theta_*$ gives:\n$$\n\\theta_* (1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B) = 1\n$$\nSolving for $\\theta_*$ yields:\n$$\n\\theta_* = \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B}\n$$\nThis expression for the vacant site fraction can now be substituted back into the rate equation $r = k K_A K_B p_A p_B \\theta_*^2$:\n$$\nr = k K_A K_B p_A p_B \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} \\right)^2\n$$\nThis leads to the final, closed-form expression for the steady-state rate of reaction, which depends only on the given constants and partial pressures:\n$$\nr = \\frac{k K_A K_B p_A p_B}{(1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B)^2}\n$$\nThis is the correct and complete derivation based on the provided mechanism and assumptions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k K_A K_B p_A p_B}{(1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B)^2}}\n$$", "id": "2625712"}, {"introduction": "A derived rate law is more than just a mathematical formula; it is a predictive model of a system's behavior. A powerful way to interpret these models is by analyzing how the apparent reaction order changes with conditions, which provides insight into the underlying surface chemistry.

It presents a standard model in heterogeneous catalysis known as the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. All required definitions, constants, and relationships are provided, and there are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. The problem is a formal exercise in applying fundamental principles of chemical kinetics and is directly relevant to the specified topic. Therefore, I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the turnover frequency, $r$, as a function of the partial pressure of reactant $A$, $p_A$, and the adsorption equilibrium constant, $K_A$. This requires relating the surface coverage of species $A$, $\\theta_A$, to $p_A$.\n\nThe first step is to use the provided quasi-equilibrated adsorption step:\n$$A + * \\rightleftharpoons A*$$\nThe law of mass action for this equilibrium, under the specified mean-field approximation where activities of surface species are replaced by their fractional coverages, is given by the definition of the equilibrium constant $K_A$:\n$$K_A = \\frac{\\theta_A}{\\theta_* p_A}$$\nwhere $\\theta_A$ is the fractional coverage of sites occupied by $A$, $\\theta_*$ is the fractional coverage of vacant sites, and $p_A$ is the partial pressure of $A$. This can be rearranged to express $\\theta_A$ in terms of $\\theta_*$:\n$$\\theta_A = K_A p_A \\theta_*$$\n\nThe second step is to invoke the site balance. The problem states that the surface contains a single population of active sites, $*$. The reactant $A$ adsorbs to form $A*$, and the product $P*$ desorbs so rapidly that its coverage is negligible. Therefore, the total number of sites is accounted for by the sum of vacant sites and sites occupied by reactant $A$. The sum of their fractional coverages must be unity:\n$$\\theta_A + \\theta_* = 1$$\nThis can be rearranged to express $\\theta_*$ in terms of $\\theta_A$:\n$$\\theta_* = 1 - \\theta_A$$\n\nNow, we solve this system of two equations for $\\theta_A$. Substitute the expression for $\\theta_*$ into the rearranged equilibrium expression:\n$$\\theta_A = K_A p_A (1 - \\theta_A)$$\nExpanding the right-hand side gives:\n$$\\theta_A = K_A p_A - K_A p_A \\theta_A$$\nWe collect terms containing $\\theta_A$:\n$$\\theta_A + K_A p_A \\theta_A = K_A p_A$$\n$$\\theta_A (1 + K_A p_A) = K_A p_A$$\nSolving for $\\theta_A$ yields the Langmuir isotherm:\n$$\\theta_A = \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A}$$\n\nThe problem defines the turnover frequency, $r$, as a function of $\\theta_A$ for the rate-limiting step $2A* \\rightarrow P* + *$:\n$$r \\equiv k_s \\theta_A^2$$\nwhere $k_s$ is the surface reaction rate coefficient. Substituting the derived expression for $\\theta_A$ into the equation for $r$ gives the explicit dependence of the turnover frequency on $p_A$ and $K_A$:\n$$r(p_A, K_A) = k_s \\left( \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A} \\right)^2$$\n\nNext, we must determine the instantaneous observed reaction order in $A$, defined as $n(p_A) \\equiv \\frac{d \\ln r}{d \\ln p_A}$.

We use the identity $\\frac{d f}{d \\ln x} = x \\frac{df}{dx}$.\n$$n(p_A) = \\frac{d}{d \\ln p_A} (\\ln r) = \\frac{d}{d \\ln p_A} [\\ln k_s + 2 \\ln K_A] + \\frac{d}{d \\ln p_A} [2 \\ln p_A] - \\frac{d}{d \\ln p_A} [2 \\ln(1 + K_A p_A)]$$\nThe first term is the derivative of constants, which is $0$. The second term is $\\frac{d(2 \\ln p_A)}{d \\ln p_A} = 2$. For the third term, we apply the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{d}{d \\ln p_A} [2 \\ln(1 + K_A p_A)] = p_A \\frac{d}{d p_A} [2 \\ln(1 + K_A p_A)] = p_A \\left( 2 \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A} \\cdot K_A \\right) = \\frac{2 K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A}$$\nCombining these results gives the expression for $n(p_A)$:\n$$n(p_A) = 2 - \\frac{2 K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A}$$\nSimplifying this expression by finding a common denominator:\n$$n(p_A) = \\frac{2(1 + K_A p_A) - 2 K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A} = \\frac{2 + 2 K_A p_A - 2 K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A} = \\frac{2}{1 + K_A p_A}$$\n\nWe must now show that $n(p_A)$ transitions continuously from $2$ to $0$ as the dimensionless product $K_A p_A$ increases from $0$ to $\\infty$. We examine the two limiting cases.\nIn the limit of low surface coverage ($p_A \\to 0$ or $K_A \\to 0$):\n$$\\lim_{K_A p_A \\to 0} n(p_A) = \\lim_{K_A p_A \\to 0} \\frac{2}{1 + K_A p_A} = \\frac{2}{1+0} = 2$$\nIn this regime, $\\theta_A \\approx K_A p_A$, so $r \\approx k_s (K_A p_A)^2$. The rate is proportional to $p_A^2$.\nIn the limit of high surface coverage ($p_A \\to \\infty$ or $K_A \\to \\infty$):\n$$\\lim_{K_A p_A \\to \\infty} n(p_A) = \\lim_{K_A p_A \\to \\infty} \\frac{2}{1 + K_A p_A} = 0$$\nIn this regime, $\\theta_A \\to 1$ and $r \\to k_s$. The rate becomes independent of $p_A$.\nThe function $n(p_A) = \\frac{2}{1 + K_A p_A}$ is a continuous function for all non-negative values of $K_A p_A$. Thus, the reaction order continuously transitions from $2$ to $0$.\n\nThe physical reason for this transition is **site blocking**. The reaction requires two adjacent $A*$ species. At very low partial pressures of $A$, the surface is mostly vacant ($\\theta_A \\ll 1$). The rate of reaction is then limited by the probability of finding two $A*$ species together, which is proportional to $\\theta_A^2$. Since $\\theta_A$ is itself proportional to $p_A$ in this limit, the overall rate is proportional to $p_A^2$, giving a reaction order of $2$. As $p_A$ increases, the surface coverage $\\theta_A$ increases. However, the number of vacant sites $\\theta_* = 1 - \\theta_A$ decreases. At very high partial pressures, the surface becomes saturated with $A*$, meaning $\\theta_A \\to 1$. Almost all active sites are occupied or 'blocked' by the reactant. At this point, the surface concentration of the reactant is maximal and cannot be increased further by increasing the gas-phase partial pressure $p_A$. The rate $r = k_s \\theta_A^2$ approaches a constant maximum value $k_s$. Since the rate is no longer dependent on $p_A$, the reaction order becomes $0$. The transition from order $2$ to $0$ directly reflects the shift from a regime where the rate is controlled by the encounter of reactants on a sparsely populated surface to a regime where the rate is limited by the fixed number of sites on a saturated surface.\n\nFinally, we must determine the crossover criterion where $n(p_A) = 1$. We set our expression for $n(p_A)$ equal to $1$ and solve for the product $K_A p_A$:\n$$\\frac{2}{1 + K_A p_A} = 1$$\n$$2 = 1 + K_A p_A$$\n$$K_A p_A = 2 - 1 = 1$$\nThe crossover from an order greater than $1$ to an order less than $1$ occurs precisely when the dimensionless group $K_A p_A$ is equal to $1$. At this point, the fractional coverage of vacant sites is equal to the fractional coverage of occupied sites, $\\theta_A = \\theta_* = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe value requested is that of the product $K_A p_A$, which is a pure number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2625730"}, {"introduction": "Connecting kinetic theory to real-world catalysis requires quantifying key properties of the catalyst, such as the number of active sites.
