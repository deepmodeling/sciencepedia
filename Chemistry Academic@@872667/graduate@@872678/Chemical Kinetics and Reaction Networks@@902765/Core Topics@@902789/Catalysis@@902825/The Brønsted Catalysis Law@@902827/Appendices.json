To do this, they prepare a series of buffer solutions, all using the exact same weak acid/conjugate base pair, but adjusted to cover a range of different pH values. For each buffer solution, the student measures the initial rate of the reaction and calculates the corresponding pseudo-first-order rate constant, $k_{obs}$.\n\nAfter collecting the data, the student plots the base-10 logarithm of the rate constant, $\\log_{10}(k_{obs})$, on the vertical axis against the pH of the buffer solution on the horizontal axis. They observe a region where the data points form a straight line. The student presents this graph as a \"Brønsted plot\" and identifies the slope of the linear region as the Brønsted catalysis coefficient, $\\alpha$.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately identifies the fundamental conceptual flaw in the student's interpretation?\n\nA. A Brønsted plot must relate the catalytic rate constant to the acid dissociation constant ($\\text{p}K_a$) of a series of different, structurally related acid catalysts, not to the pH of the solution for a single catalyst.\n\nB. A Brønsted plot is only valid if the natural logarithm, $\\ln(k_{obs})$, is plotted, not the base-10 logarithm, $\\log_{10}(k_{obs})$.\n\nC. The Brønsted catalysis law is only applicable to elementary reaction steps, and thus cannot be used with an observed rate constant like $k_{obs}$ which may represent a complex multi-step process.\n\nD. The student's plot is only a valid Brønsted plot if the concentration of the acidic form of the buffer, [HA], was held constant across all experiments, which is not true when changing the pH of a buffer system.\n\nE. The linearity of a Brønsted plot is only expected for base-catalyzed reactions, not for acid-catalyzed reactions as studied here.", "solution": "We begin by recalling what a Brønsted catalysis plot represents. For a family of structurally related general acid catalysts $\\{\\mathrm{HA}_{i}\\}$ that promote the same rate-limiting step by proton transfer to the substrate, the Brønsted relation correlates the catalytic rate constant for each acid, $k_{\\mathrm{HA}_{i}}$, with the intrinsic acidity of that acid. A common form is\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{HA}_{i}}=k^{0}\\,K_{a,i}^{\\alpha},\n$$\nwhich upon taking base-10 logarithms becomes\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\!\\left(k_{\\mathrm{HA}_{i}}\\right)=\\log_{10}\\!\\left(k^{0}\\right)+\\alpha\\log_{10}\\!\\left(K_{a,i}\\right)\n=\\log_{10}\\!\\left(k^{0}\\right)-\\alpha\\,\\text{p}K_{a,i}.\n$$\nThus, a proper Brønsted plot for general acid catalysis is a plot of $\\log_{10}(k_{\\mathrm{HA}_{i}})$ versus $\\text{p}K_{a,i}$ for a series of different acids $i$, with slope equal to $-\\alpha$ (up to the sign convention used). Crucially, the abscissa is the intrinsic property $\\text{p}K_{a}$ of each different acid catalyst, not the pH of the solution.\n\nNow compare this with the student’s experiment. The student uses one fixed conjugate acid/base pair $\\mathrm{HA}/\\mathrm{A}^{-}$ and varies the solution pH by changing their ratio. For a general acid mechanism, the observed pseudo-first-order rate constant typically takes the form\n$$\nk_{obs}=k_{\\mathrm{HA}}[\\mathrm{HA}]+k_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]+k_{0},\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{HA}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}$ are the second-order catalytic constants for the acid and base forms (if both contribute), and $k_{0}$ accounts for any uncatalyzed or solvent-catalyzed background. As pH is varied within a single buffer system of fixed total buffer concentration $C_{t}=[\\mathrm{HA}]+[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]$, the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH}=\\text{p}K_{a}+\\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]}\\right)\n$$\nimplies\n$$\n[\\mathrm{HA}]=\\frac{C_{t}}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\text{p}K_{a}}},\\qquad\n[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]=\\frac{C_{t}10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\text{p}K_{a}}}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\text{p}K_{a}}}.\n$$\nTherefore, plotting $\\log_{10}(k_{obs})$ versus pH within a single buffer system produces a pH–rate profile that reflects how $[\\mathrm{HA}]$ and $[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]$ change with pH, not how the intrinsic catalytic constant varies with the intrinsic acidity of different acids. Any linear region and its slope in a pH–rate profile report on reaction orders in the catalytically active species (e.g., order in $\\mathrm{H}^+$ for specific acid catalysis, or dependence on $[\\mathrm{HA}]$ and $[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]$ for general acid/base catalysis), not on the Brønsted coefficient $\\alpha$.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n\n- Option A states that a Brønsted plot must relate the catalytic rate constant to $\\text{p}K_{a}$ for a series of different acids, not to pH for a single acid. This matches the standard Brønsted formulation derived above and pinpoints the fundamental error: the student varied pH (solution composition) instead of $\\text{p}K_{a}$ (intrinsic acidity across different catalysts).\n\n- Option B is incorrect because changing the logarithm base only rescales the slope by the constant factor $\\ln 10$: $\\log_{10}(x)=(\\ln x)/\\ln 10$. Either base is acceptable if interpreted consistently.\n\n- Option C is not the fundamental flaw: Brønsted correlations are intended for the rate-limiting proton transfer step; when $k_{obs}$ is dominated by that step under pseudo-first-order conditions, it can be used. The student’s primary mistake is not about multi-step kinetics but about plotting the wrong independent variable.\n\n- Option D mentions holding $[\\mathrm{HA}]$ constant. While controlling catalyst concentration is important for comparing different acids in a proper Brønsted study, keeping $[\\mathrm{HA}]$ constant while varying pH within a single acid/base pair still does not create a Brønsted plot, because $\\text{p}K_{a}$ is unchanged. Thus this is not the core conceptual flaw.\n\n- Option E is false: Brønsted plots apply to both general acid and general base catalysis.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate identification of the fundamental conceptual flaw is that a true Brønsted plot requires varying the catalyst’s $\\text{p}K_{a}$ across a series of different acids, not varying pH for a single buffer system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1516610"}]}
