A rigorous solution follows.\n\nThe deactivation of the first excited singlet state, $S_1$, occurs through three competing, parallel, first-order pathways. The rate law for the depletion of the concentration of $S_1$, denoted $[S_1]$, is therefore:\n$$\n-\\frac{d[S_1]}{dt} = (k_f + k_{nr} + k_{ISC}) [S_1]\n$$\nThis is a first-order differential equation.

A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive the nonradiative rate constant $k_{nr}$. This requires first determining the radiative rate constant, $k_{r}$, from the provided oscillator strength $f$ and emission wavelength $\\lambda$.\n\nThe dimensionless oscillator strength, $f$, relates the quantum mechanical transition probability to that of a classical harmonically bound electron. For a transition between an initial state and a final state with transition angular frequency $\\omega$, it is defined in SI units as:\n$$ f = \\frac{2 m_e \\omega}{3 \\hbar e^2} |\\vec{\\mu}|^2 $$\nwhere $m_e$ is the electron mass, $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $|\\vec{\\mu}|$ is the magnitude of the transition electric dipole moment. While oscillator strength is typically defined for an absorption process ($S_0 \\rightarrow S_1$), the magnitude of the transition dipole moment is the same for absorption and emission in a two-level system. We can therefore use this definition with the understanding that $f$ represents the strength of the electronic transition. We can rearrange this expression to solve for $|\\vec{\\mu}|^2$:\n$$ |\\vec{\\mu}|^2 = \\frac{3 \\hbar e^2 f}{2 m_e \\omega} $$\n\nThe radiative rate constant $k_r$ is equivalent to the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission, $A_{21}$, for the transition from the excited state (2, i.e., $S_1$) to the ground state (1, i.e., $S_0$). In a medium with refractive index $n$, this rate is given by:\n$$ k_r = \\frac{n \\omega^3 |\\vec{\\mu}|^2}{3 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\hbar c^3} $$\nThe problem specifies free space, so the refractive index is $n=1$.\n$$ k_r = \\frac{\\omega^3 |\\vec{\\mu}|^2}{3 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\hbar c^3} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $|\\vec{\\mu}|^2$ from the oscillator strength definition into the equation for $k_r$:\n$$ k_r = \\frac{\\omega^3}{3 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\hbar c^3} \\left( \\frac{3 \\hbar e^2 f}{2 m_e \\omega} \\right) $$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling terms ($3$, $\\hbar$, $\\pi$, and one power of $\\omega$):\n$$ k_r = \\frac{\\omega^2 e^2 f}{2 \\pi \\epsilon_0 m_e c^3} $$\nThe problem requires the expression in terms of wavelength $\\lambda$.

The value for $k_f = 3 \\times 10^8\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ is consistent with the other parameters, as $k_f  1/\\tau_{f,0} \\approx 3.33 \\times 10^8\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, but is not required for the final numerical calculation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.22 \\times 10^{-2}}\n$$", "id": "2663406"}]}
