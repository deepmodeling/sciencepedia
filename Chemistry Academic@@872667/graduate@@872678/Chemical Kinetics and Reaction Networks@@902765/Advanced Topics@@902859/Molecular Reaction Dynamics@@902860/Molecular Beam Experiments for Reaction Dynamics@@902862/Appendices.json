A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Flux-Weighted Speed Distribution $f_F(v)$**\nThe three-dimensional Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution for a gas in equilibrium at temperature $T$ gives the probability density of finding a molecule with velocity components in the range $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ to $(v_x + dv_x, v_y + dv_y, v_z + dv_z)$. It is given by:\n$$\nf_{\\text{MB}}(v_x, v_y, v_z) \\, dv_x \\, dv_y \\, dv_z = N \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2k_B T}\\right) \\, dv_x \\, dv_y \\, dv_z\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number density.\nThe rate at which molecules with a specific velocity vector $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ cross an aperture of area $dA$ in the $xy$-plane is proportional to the number of such molecules that can reach the aperture in time $dt$. This number is contained in a volume $dA \\cdot |v_z| \\cdot dt$. Therefore, the flux (number per unit area per unit time) is proportional to $|v_z| f_{\\text{MB}}(v_x, v_y, v_z)$. Since molecules only cross from the reservoir into the vacuum, we consider only $v_z > 0$.\nThe unnormalized velocity distribution of molecules in the effusive beam, $\\mathcal{F}(v_x, v_y, v_z)$, is thus proportional to $v_z f_{\\text{MB}}(v_x, v_y, v_z)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}(v_x, v_y, v_z) \\propto v_z \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2k_B T}\\right), \\quad \\text{for } v_z > 0\n$$\nTo find the speed distribution, we transform to spherical coordinates in velocity space, where $v_x = v \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi$, $v_y = v \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi$, $v_z = v \\cos\\theta$, and the volume element is $dv_x \\, dv_y \\, dv_z = v^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dv \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$. The condition $v_z > 0$ restricts the polar angle to $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi/2$. The speed is $v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}$.\nThe unnormalized distribution in spherical coordinates is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}(v, \\theta, \\phi) \\propto (v \\cos\\theta) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) v^2 \\sin\\theta\n$$\nTo obtain the unnormalized speed distribution, $g_F(v)$, we integrate over the angular variables $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$ and $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]$:\n$$\ng_F(v) \\propto \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} v^3 \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) d\\theta \\, d\\phi\n$$\nThe integral separates:\n$$\ng_F(v) \\propto v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) \\left(\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi\\right) \\left(\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta\\right)\n$$\nThe angular integrals evaluate to constants: $\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi = 2\\pi$ and $\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta = \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\theta\\right]_0^{\\pi/2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Their product is $\\pi$, a constant which can be absorbed into the proportionality constant.\nThus, the unnormalized flux-weighted speed distribution is:\n$$\ng_F(v) = C v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nTo find the normalized probability density $f_F(v)$, we must enforce the condition $\\int_0^\\infty f_F(v) \\, dv = 1$. Let $f_F(v) = C' g_F(v)$.\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv = 1/C'\n$$\nThis is a standard integral of the form $\\int_0^\\infty x^{2n+1} \\exp(-ax^2) dx = \\frac{n!}{2a^{n+1}}$. Here, $n=1$ and $a = \\frac{m}{2k_B T}$.\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv = \\frac{1!}{2\\left(\\frac{m}{2k_B T}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{2 \\frac{m^2}{4(k_B T)^2}} = \\frac{2(k_B T)^2}{m^2}\n$$\nThe normalization constant is the reciprocal of this value: $C' = \\frac{m^2}{2(k_B T)^2}$.\nThe normalized flux-weighted speed probability density is therefore:\n$$\nf_F(v) = \\frac{m^2}{2(k_B T)^2} v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Terminal Supersonic Speed $u_{\\infty}$**\nFor a steady-flow isentropic expansion of an ideal gas from a reservoir into a vacuum, the specific enthalpy is conserved along a streamline.

In the terminal state (state $\\infty$), the gas has speed $u_{\\infty}$ and static temperature $T_{\\infty}$. Conservation of energy implies $h_0 = h_{\\infty} + \\frac{1}{2}u_{\\infty}^2$.\nThe specific enthalpy of an ideal gas is $h = c_p T_{\\text{static}}$. Thus, $h_0 = c_p T_0 = c_p T$. The energy balance becomes:\n$$\nc_p T = c_p T_{\\infty} + \\frac{1}{2}u_{\\infty}^2\n$$\nThe problem states to assume that in the high-Mach-number limit of the expansion, the terminal static temperature vanishes: $T_{\\infty} \\to 0$. This corresponds to the complete conversion of initial thermal energy into directed kinetic energy. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nc_p T = \\frac{1}{2}u_{\\infty}^2\n$$\nSolving for the terminal speed $u_{\\infty}$:\n$$\nu_{\\infty} = \\sqrt{2 c_p T}\n$$\nUsing the provided relation for the specific heat capacity per unit mass, $c_p = \\frac{\\gamma k_B}{(\\gamma - 1)m}$:\n$$\nu_{\\infty} = \\sqrt{2 \\left(\\frac{\\gamma k_B}{(\\gamma-1)m}\\right) T} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\gamma k_B T}{m(\\gamma-1)}}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Ratio $r(\\gamma) = v_{\\mathrm{mp}}/u_{\\infty}$**\nFirst, we find the most probable speed, $v_{\\mathrm{mp}}$, of the effusive flux-weighted distribution $f_F(v)$ by finding the maximum of the function. We take the derivative of $f_F(v)$ with respect to $v$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{d f_F(v)}{dv} = \\frac{d}{dv} \\left[ \\frac{m^2}{2(k_B T)^2} v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) \\right] = 0\n$$\nIgnoring the constant prefactor:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dv} \\left[ v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) \\right] = 3v^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) + v^3 \\left(-\\frac{2mv}{2k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) = 0\n$$\nFactoring out common terms for $v \\neq 0$:\n$$\n3v^2 - \\frac{mv^4}{k_B T} = 0\n$$\n$$\n3 = \\frac{mv^2}{k_B T}\n$$\nSolving for $v$, which is $v_{\\mathrm{mp}}$:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{mp}}^2 = \\frac{3k_B T}{m} \\quad \\implies \\quad v_{\\mathrm{mp}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3k_B T}{m}}\n$$\nNow, we form the dimensionless ratio $r(\\gamma) = v_{\\mathrm{mp}}/u_{\\infty}$ using the expressions derived.\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{mp}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3k_B T}{m}}\n$$\n$$\nu_{\\infty} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\gamma k_B T}{m(\\gamma-1)}}\n$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\nr(\\gamma) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{3k_B T}{m}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma k_B T}{m(\\gamma-1)}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{3k_B T}{m}}{\\frac{2\\gamma k_B T}{m(\\gamma-1)}}}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling common terms ($k_B$, $T$, $m$):\n$$\nr(\\gamma) = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{1} \\cdot \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2\\gamma}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3(\\gamma-1)}{2\\gamma}}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the ratio in terms of the heat-capacity ratio $\\gamma$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{3(\\gamma-1)}{2\\gamma}}}\n$$", "id": "2656999"}, {"introduction": "A key advantage of supersonic beams is the dramatic cooling that occurs during the expansion, which prepares reactant molecules in well-defined, low-energy quantum states.

The problem is objective, free of ambiguity, and contains all necessary information for its solution. It does not violate any fundamental principles of physics or mathematics. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady-flow energy equation, which is a statement of the first law of thermodynamics for a control volume at steady state. For an adiabatic flow with no shaft work ($w_s=0$) and negligible changes in potential energy (as body forces are negligible), the equation simplifies to the conservation of total enthalpy, $h_0$:\n$$h + \\frac{1}{2}v^2 = h_0$$\nHere, $h$ is the static enthalpy per unit mass, $v$ is the flow velocity, and $h_0$ is the total or stagnation enthalpy per unit mass, which is a constant along a streamline. The stagnation state corresponds to the conditions in the reservoir where the fluid is at rest ($v \\approx 0$), so $h_0$ is the enthalpy of the gas in the reservoir.\n\nThe problem states that the carrier gas is modeled as a calorically perfect gas, which means its specific heats, $c_p$ and $c_v$, are constant. For such a gas, the enthalpy is a direct function of temperature: $h = c_p T$. The stagnation enthalpy is correspondingly $h_0 = c_p T_0$, where $T_0$ is the stagnation temperature (the temperature in the reservoir).

We can solve Equation (2) for $P_1$:\n$$P_1 = \\frac{S_2 + C_{12}}{C_{12}} P_2$$\nSubstitute this expression for $P_1$ into Equation (1):\n$$Q_0 = (S_1 + C_{12}) \\left(\\frac{S_2 + C_{12}}{C_{12}}\\right) P_2 - C_{12} P_2$$\nTo solve for $P_2$, we factor it out:\n$$Q_0 = \\left[ \\frac{(S_1 + C_{12})(S_2 + C_{12})}{C_{12}} - C_{12} \\right] P_2$$\nWe combine the terms inside the brackets over a common denominator $C_{12}$:\n$$Q_0 = \\left[ \\frac{S_1 S_2 + S_1 C_{12} + C_{12} S_2 + C_{12}^2 - C_{12}^2}{C_{12}} \\right] P_2$$\n$$Q_0 = \\left[ \\frac{S_1 S_2 + (S_1 + S_2)C_{12}}{C_{12}} \\right] P_2$$\nThe resulting expression for $P_2$ is:\n$$P_2 = \\frac{Q_0 C_{12}}{S_1 S_2 + (S_1 + S_2)C_{12}}$$\nThis completes the derivation for part (a).\n\nFor part (b), we first calculate the numerical value of $P_2$ using the provided data:\n- $Q_0 = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\mathrm{/s}$\n- $S_1 = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\mathrm{/s}$\n- $S_2 = 1.000\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\mathrm{/s}$\n- $C_{12} = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\mathrm{/s}$\n\n$$P_2 = \\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^{-3})(0.010)}{(0.150)(1.000) + (0.150 + 1.000)(0.010)}$$\n$$P_2 = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.150 + (1.150)(0.010)} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.150 + 0.0115} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.1615}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\n\nThe ideal gas law in terms of number density $n = N/V$ is $P = n k_B T$.
