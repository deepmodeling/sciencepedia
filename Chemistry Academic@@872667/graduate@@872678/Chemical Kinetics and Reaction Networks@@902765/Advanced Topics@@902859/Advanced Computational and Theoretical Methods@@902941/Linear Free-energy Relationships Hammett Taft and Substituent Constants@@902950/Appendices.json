Although both DSP and Yukawa–Tsuno have higher complexity ($p=2$) than Hammett ($p=1$), their substantially improved fit quality (much smaller $\\mathrm{RSS}$) more than compensates for the $+2p$ penalty. Between the two two-parameter models, Yukawa–Tsuno achieves an orders-of-magnitude smaller $\\mathrm{RSS}$ by explicitly modeling resonance demand through $\\Delta\\sigma_R$, leading to a dramatically lower AIC-like score, despite having the same complexity penalty as DSP. This illustrates the core trade-off: adding parameters increases the penalty, but if they capture mechanistically relevant variability (here, resonance demand), the reduction in $\\mathrm{RSS}$ can dominate, yielding a better overall balance of fit quality and model parsimony.\n\nAccording to the required mapping (Hammett $=1$, DSP $=2$, Yukawa–Tsuno $=3$), the selected model is Yukawa–Tsuno.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2652576"}]}
