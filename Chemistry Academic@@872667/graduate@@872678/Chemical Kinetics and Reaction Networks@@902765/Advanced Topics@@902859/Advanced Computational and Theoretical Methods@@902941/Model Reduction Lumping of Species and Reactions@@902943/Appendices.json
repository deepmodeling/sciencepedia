The left side of the equation is a function of $x_B$, while the right side is a constant. This can only be true if the coefficient of $x_B$ on the left side is zero.\n$$\n-2k_3 = 0 \\implies k_3 = 0\n$$\nHowever, the problem requires the lumping to be closed for *generic* positive parameters $(k_f, k_b, k_3) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{0}^3$.

Therefore, no such lumping with $l_1 \\neq l_2$ exists for generic parameters.\n\nThe only valid condition for a closed linear lumping is $l_1 = l_2$.

We first need to compute the terms involved.\nThe partial derivative of $g$ with respect to $y$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -x - (\\kappa + \\rho)\n$$\nThe derivative of $h_0(x)$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dh_0}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{x}{x + \\kappa + \\rho}\\right) = \\frac{1(x + \\kappa + \\rho) - x(1)}{(x + \\kappa + \\rho)^2} = \\frac{\\kappa + \\rho}{(x + \\kappa + \\rho)^2}\n$$\nThe function $f(x,y)$ evaluated on the critical manifold $y=h_0(x)$ is:\n$$\nf(x, h_0(x)) = -x + x h_0(x) + \\kappa h_0(x) = -x + (x+\\kappa)h_0(x)\n$$\n$$\nf(x, h_0(x)) = -x + (x+\\kappa)\\left(\\frac{x}{x + \\kappa + \\rho}\\right) = \\frac{-x(x + \\kappa + \\rho) + x(x+\\kappa)}{x + \\kappa + \\rho} = \\frac{-x^2 - x\\kappa - x\\rho + x^2 + x\\kappa}{x + \\kappa + \\rho} = \\frac{-x\\rho}{x + \\kappa + \\rho}\n$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the $O(\\epsilon^1)$ equation to find $h_1(x)$:\n$$\nh_1(x) \\left[ -x - (\\kappa + \\rho) \\right] = \\left( \\frac{\\kappa + \\rho}{(x + \\kappa + \\rho)^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{-x\\rho}{x + \\kappa + \\rho} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n-h_1(x) (x + \\kappa + \\rho) = \\frac{-x\\rho(\\kappa + \\rho)}{(x + \\kappa + \\rho)^3}\n$$\nSolving for $h_1(x)$:\n$$\nh_1(x) = \\frac{x\\rho(\\kappa + \\rho)}{(x + \\kappa + \\rho)^4}\n$$\nThe dynamics on the slow manifold are described by the evolution of the slow variable $x$. The time variable for the slow dynamics is $T = \\epsilon \\tau$. The governing equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dT} = \\frac{dx}{d(\\epsilon \\tau)} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = f(x, y)\n$$\nRestricting the dynamics to the invariant manifold $y = h(x;\\epsilon)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dT} = f(x, h(x;\\epsilon)) = f(x, h_0(x) + \\epsilon h_1(x) + O(\\epsilon^2))\n$$\nExpanding the right-hand side in powers of $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dT} = f(x, h_0(x)) + \\epsilon\\, h_1(x) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x, h_0(x)) + O(\\epsilon^2)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the term $F_1(x)$ in the expansion:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dT} = f(x,h_0(x)) + \\epsilon\\,F_1(x) + O(\\epsilon^2)\n$$\nBy comparison, we identify $F_1(x)$ as:\n$$\nF_1(x) = h_1(x) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x, h_0(x))\n$$\nWe need the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = x + \\kappa\n$$\nThis expression is independent of $y$, so $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x, h_0(x)) = x + \\kappa$.\nFinally, we assemble the expression for $F_1(x)$:\n$$\nF_1(x) = \\left( \\frac{x\\rho(\\kappa + \\rho)}{(x + \\kappa + \\rho)^4} \\right) (x + \\kappa)\n$$\nThis gives the explicit closed-form expression for the $O(\\epsilon)$ correction term to the reduced slow dynamics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{x \\rho (\\kappa + \\rho) (x + \\kappa)}{(x + \\kappa + \\rho)^4}}$$", "id": "2655913"}]}
