It is scientifically sound and contains all necessary information for a unique analytical solution. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system consists of a promoter with two identical binding sites for a transcription factor $T$. The binding process is at thermodynamic equilibrium. We can model this system using statistical mechanics by enumerating the possible states of the promoter and their corresponding statistical weights. Let $P_i$ denote the state of the promoter with $i$ bound molecules of $T$. The possible states are $P_0$ (unoccupied), $P_1$ (one site occupied), and $P_2$ (both sites occupied).\n\nThe statistical weight of a state is proportional to its concentration at equilibrium. We define the statistical weight of the unoccupied state, $W_0$, as the reference, so $W_0 = 1$.\n\nFor the state with one occupied site, $P_1$, the binding reaction is $P_0 + T \\rightleftharpoons P_1$ (considering one specific site). The dissociation constant is $K_d = \\frac{[P_0][T]}{[P_1, \\text{site 1}]}$. The concentration, and thus the statistical weight, is proportional to $\\frac{[T]}{K_d}$. Since there are two identical and independent sites, the total statistical weight for having one molecule bound, irrespective of the site, is the sum of the weights for each microstate (site 1 bound or site 2 bound). This gives a combinatorial factor of $\\binom{2}{1}=2$. Therefore, the statistical weight for the singly-occupied state is:\n$$\nW_1 = 2 \\frac{[T]}{K_d}\n$$\n\nFor the state with two occupied sites, $P_2$, the reaction is $P_0 + 2T \\rightleftharpoons P_2$. The problem states that a cooperativity factor $\\omega$ multiplies the statistical weight of the doubly-occupied state. For two independent binding events, the statistical weight would be $\\left(\\frac{[T]}{K_d}\\right)^2$. The cooperativity factor modifies this to:\n$$\nW_2 = \\omega \\left(\\frac{[T]}{K_d}\\right)^2\n$$\nHere, $\\omega  1$ corresponds to positive cooperativity, meaning the binding of the second ligand is more favorable than it would be otherwise.\n\nThe partition function, $Z$, is the sum of all statistical weights and serves as the normalization factor for probabilities.\n$$\nZ = W_0 + W_1 + W_2 = 1 + 2 \\frac{[T]}{K_d} + \\omega \\left(\\frac{[T]}{K_d}\\right)^2\n$$\n\nThe average number of occupied sites, $\\langle N \\rangle$, is the sum of the number of occupied sites in each state, weighted by the probability of that state:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{2} i \\cdot W_i}{Z} = \\frac{0 \\cdot W_0 + 1 \\cdot W_1 + 2 \\cdot W_2}{Z} = \\frac{2 \\frac{[T]}{K_d} + 2\\omega \\left(\\frac{[T]}{K_d}\\right)^2}{1 + 2 \\frac{[T]}{K_d} + \\omega \\left(\\frac{[T]}{K_d}\\right)^2}\n$$\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the mean number of occupied sites divided by the total number of sites, which is $2$.\n$$\n\\theta([T]) = \\frac{\\langle N \\rangle}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{[T]}{K_d} + \\omega \\left(\\frac{[T]}{K_d}\\right)^2}{1 + 2 \\frac{[T]}{K_d} + \\omega \\left(\\frac{[T]}{K_d}\\right)^2}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the fractional occupancy.

The expression for $\\theta$ becomes:\n$$\n\\theta(x) = \\frac{x + \\omega x^2}{1 + 2x + \\omega x^2}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we must compute the effective Hill coefficient, $n_H$, at half-occupancy ($\\theta = 1/2$). The definition is given as:\n$$\nn_{H} \\equiv \\left.\\frac{d \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right)}{d \\ln [T]}\\right|_{\\theta=1/2}\n$$\nFirst, we find the expression for the ratio $\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}$.\n$$\n1-\\theta = 1 - \\frac{x + \\omega x^2}{1 + 2x + \\omega x^2} = \\frac{(1 + 2x + \\omega x^2) - (x + \\omega x^2)}{1 + 2x + \\omega x^2} = \\frac{1+x}{1 + 2x + \\omega x^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta} = \\frac{x + \\omega x^2}{1+x} = \\frac{x(1+\\omega x)}{1+x}\n$$\nLet $Y(x) = \\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}$. We need to compute the derivative of $\\ln(Y)$ with respect to $\\ln([T])$. Since $x = [T]/K_d$, we have $\\ln(x) = \\ln([T]) - \\ln(K_d)$, which implies $d\\ln(x) = d\\ln([T])$. Therefore, the derivative can be taken with respect to $\\ln(x)$.\n$$\nn_H(x) = \\frac{d \\ln(Y)}{d \\ln(x)}\n$$\nWe have $\\ln(Y) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{x(1+\\omega x)}{1+x}\\right) = \\ln(x) + \\ln(1+\\omega x) - \\ln(1+x)$.\nDifferentiating with respect to $x$ and multiplying by $x$ (which is equivalent to differentiating wrt $\\ln x$):\n$$\nn_H(x) = x \\left( \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(Y) \\right) = x \\left(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{\\omega}{1+\\omega x} - \\frac{1}{1+x}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{\\omega x}{1+\\omega x} - \\frac{x}{1+x}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the Hill coefficient as a function of concentration $x$. We must evaluate it at half-occupancy, i.e., where $\\theta=1/2$. Let's find the concentration $x_{1/2}$ that satisfies this condition.\n$$\n\\theta(x_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\frac{x_{1/2} + \\omega x_{1/2}^2}{1 + 2x_{1/2} + \\omega x_{1/2}^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\n2(x_{1/2} + \\omega x_{1/2}^2) = 1 + 2x_{1/2} + \\omega x_{1/2}^2\n$$\n$$\n2x_{1/2} + 2\\omega x_{1/2}^2 = 1 + 2x_{1/2} + \\omega x_{1/2}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\omega x_{1/2}^2 = 1 \\implies x_{1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\omega}}\n$$\nWe take the positive root as concentration must be positive.

The potential is approximated quadratically around the stationary points.\nNear the minimum $x_L$: $U(x) \\approx U(x_L) + \\frac{1}{2} U''(x_L) (x - x_L)^2$.\nNear the barrier maximum $x_b$: $U(x) \\approx U(x_b) + \\frac{1}{2} U''(x_b) (x - x_b)^2$, where $U''(x_b)  0$.\n\nThe first integral is dominated by the minimum at $x_L$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{x_b} e^{-U(y)/\\varepsilon} dy \\approx e^{-U(x_L)/\\varepsilon} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-U''(x_L)(y-x_L)^2/(2\\varepsilon)} dy = e^{-U(x_L)/\\varepsilon} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi\\varepsilon}{U''(x_L)}}\n$$\nThe second integral is dominated by the maximum at $x_b$:\n$$\n\\int_a^c e^{U(y)/\\varepsilon} dy \\approx e^{U(x_b)/\\varepsilon} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{U''(x_b)(y-x_b)^2/(2\\varepsilon)} dy = e^{U(x_b)/\\varepsilon} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi\\varepsilon}{|U''(x_b)|}}\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the rate equation gives the Kramers' rate for the overdamped regime:\n$$\nk_{L \\to R} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\gamma} \\left( e^{-U(x_L)/\\varepsilon} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi\\varepsilon}{U''(x_L)}} \\right)^{-1} \\left( e^{U(x_b)/\\varepsilon} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi\\varepsilon}{|U''(x_b)|}} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{U''(x_L)|U''(x_b)|}}{2\\pi\\gamma} e^{-(U(x_b)-U(x_L))/\\varepsilon}\n$$\nDenoting the barrier height as $\\Delta U_L = U(x_b) - U(x_L)$, the forward rate is:\n$$\nk_{L \\to R} = \\frac{\\sqrt{U''(x_L)|U''(x_b)|}}{2\\pi\\gamma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta U_L}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nBy symmetry, the reverse rate $k_{R \\to L}$ is obtained by replacing the properties of the left well with those of the right well:\n$$\nk_{R \\to L} = \\frac{\\sqrt{U''(x_R)|U''(x_b)|}}{2\\pi\\gamma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta U_R}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta U_R = U(x_b) - U(x_R)$ is the barrier for escaping the right well. The mean residence times are the reciprocals of these rates: $\\tau_L = 1/k_{L \\to R}$ and $\\tau_R = 1/k_{R \\to L}$.\n\nThe algorithm to solve the problem is as follows:\n1.  For each parameter set $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\delta, \\gamma, \\varepsilon)$, find the stationary points of the potential $U(x)$ by solving the cubic equation $U'(x) = 4\\alpha x^3 - 2\\beta x + \\delta = 0$ for its roots.\n2.  Identify the real roots. If the number of distinct real roots is not three, the system is not bistable in the required double-well configuration, and the result is indeterminate ($\\mathrm{NaN}$).\n3.  Sort the three real roots, $r_1  r_2  r_3$.\n4.  Classify each root by evaluating the sign of the second derivative $U''(x) = 12\\alpha x^2 - 2\\beta$. For a valid bistable system, we require $U''(r_1)  0$ (minimum), $U''(r_2)  0$ (maximum), and $U''(r_3)  0$ (minimum). If this condition is not met, the result is indeterminate.\n5.  Assign the stable points $x_L = r_1$, $x_R = r_3$ and the unstable barrier point $x_b = r_2$.\n6.  Calculate the potential energy at these points: $U(x_L)$, $U(x_R)$, and $U(x_b)$.\n7.  Compute the barrier heights $\\Delta U_L = U(x_b) - U(x_L)$ and $\\Delta U_R = U(x_b) - U(x_R)$.\n8.  Compute the necessary curvatures: $U''(x_L)$, $U''(x_R)$, and $|U''(x_b)|$.\n9.  Calculate the mean residence times using the derived formulae:\n    $$\n    \\tau_L = \\frac{2\\pi\\gamma}{\\sqrt{U''(x_L)|U''(x_b)|}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta U_L}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\tau_R = \\frac{2\\pi\\gamma}{\\sqrt{U''(x_R)|U''(x_b)|}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta U_R}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n    $$\n10.
