The operator $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} = \\frac{dt}{dT} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{t_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\n$$\nApplying this to the concentrations $U$ and $V$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial (u_0 u)}{\\partial T} = u_0 \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial T} = u_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{t_0}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\right) = \\frac{u_0}{t_0} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial (v_0 v)}{\\partial T} = v_0 \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial T} = v_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{t_0}\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t}\\right) = \\frac{v_0}{t_0} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t}\n$$\n\nNext, we transform the Laplacian operator, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{X}}^{2}$. The gradient operator $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{X}}$ has components $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_i}$. The transformation for each component is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_i} = \\frac{dx_i}{dX_i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\n$$\nThis implies that the gradient operator itself transforms as $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{X}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}$. The Laplacian is the divergence of the gradient, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{X}}^{2} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{X}} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{X}}$, so its transformation is:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{X}}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{L} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{L} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^{2}\n$$\n\nNow we substitute these transformed expressions and scaling relations into the original PDEs.

The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = f(u, v) + \\left(\\frac{t_0 D_u}{L^2}\\right) \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^{2} u\n$$\n\nWe follow the same procedure for the inhibitor equation for $V$:\n$$\n\\frac{v_0}{t_0} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = G(u_0 u, v_0 v) + D_v \\left( \\frac{1}{L^2} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^{2} (v_0 v) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{v_0}{t_0} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = G(u_0 u, v_0 v) + \\frac{v_0 D_v}{L^2} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^{2} v\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\frac{t_0}{v_0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = \\frac{t_0}{v_0} G(u_0 u, v_0 v) + \\frac{t_0 D_v}{L^2} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^{2} v\n$$\nDefining the dimensionless reaction function $g(u, v) = \\frac{t_0}{v_0} G(u_0 u, v_0 v)$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = g(u, v) + \\left(\\frac{t_0 D_v}{L^2}\\right) \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^{2} v\n$$\n\nThe coefficients of the Laplacian terms, $\\frac{t_0 D_u}{L^2}$ and $\\frac{t_0 D_v}{L^2}$, are dimensionless groups representing the dimensionless diffusion coefficients. The problem requires that we choose the characteristic time $t_0$ such that the activator's dimensionless diffusion coefficient is equal to $1$. We therefore set:\n$$\n\\frac{t_0 D_u}{L^2} = 1\n$$\nSolving for $t_0$, we obtain the expression for the characteristic time scale, which is the diffusion time of the activator across length $L$:\n$$\nt_0 = \\frac{L^2}{D_u}\n$$\nThis choice of $t_0$ simplifies the activator equation to have a unity diffusion coefficient. We now use this specific choice of $t_0$ to determine the dimensionless diffusion coefficient for the inhibitor. We substitute the expression for $t_0$ into the inhibitor's dimensionless diffusion coefficient:\n$$\n\\text{Inhibitor's dimensionless diffusion coefficient} = \\frac{t_0 D_v}{L^2} = \\left(\\frac{L^2}{D_u}\\right) \\frac{D_v}{L^2} = \\frac{D_v}{D_u}\n$$\nThe resulting nondimensional system is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = f(u, v) + \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^{2} u\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = g(u, v) + \\left(\\frac{D_v}{D_u}\\right) \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^{2} v\n$$\nThe single remaining dimensionless parameter that governs diffusion in this system is the coefficient of the inhibitor's Laplacian term. This parameter is the ratio of the inhibitor's dimensional diffusion coefficient, $D_v$, to the activator's dimensional diffusion coefficient, $D_u$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{D_v}{D_u}}\n$$", "id": "2691352"}, {"introduction": "The central paradox of Turing's theory is that diffusion, typically a homogenizing force, can create spatial patterns.

The system is stable for a given wavenumber $k$ if and only if both eigenvalues have negative real parts. This is equivalent to the conditions $\\mathrm{Tr}(J_k) < 0$ and $\\det(J_k) > 0$.\n\nFirst, consider the case without diffusion ($k=0$). The matrix is just $J$. The problem states the homogeneous steady state is stable, which requires:\n$1$. $\\mathrm{Tr}(J) = f_u + g_v < 0$\n$2$. $\\det(J) = f_u g_v - f_v g_u > 0$\n\nFor the specific Jacobian $J=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 \\\\ 4 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}$, we have $f_u=1$, $f_v=-2$, $g_u=4$, $g_v=-3$.\n$\\mathrm{Tr}(J) = 1 + (-3) = -2 < 0$.\n$\\det(J) = (1)(-3) - (-2)(4) = -3 + 8 = 5 > 0$.\nThese conditions are satisfied, confirming the stability of the homogeneous steady state.\n\nNow, consider the case with diffusion ($k>0$). The trace and determinant of $J_k$ are:\n$\\mathrm{Tr}(J_k) = (f_u - k^2 D_u) + (g_v - k^2 D_v) = (f_u + g_v) - k^2 (D_u + D_v) = \\mathrm{Tr}(J) - k^2(D_u + D_v)$.\n$\\det(J_k) = (f_u - k^2 D_u)(g_v - k^2 D_v) - f_v g_u = (f_u g_v - f_v g_u) - k^2(f_u D_v + g_v D_u) + k^4 D_u D_v$.\n\nA diffusion-driven (Turing) instability occurs if the system is stable for $k=0$ but becomes unstable for some range of wavenumbers $k>0$.\nLet's examine the stability conditions for $k > 0$.\nSince $\\mathrm{Tr}(J) < 0$ and $D_u, D_v > 0$, the term $-k^2(D_u + D_v)$ is always negative for $k>0$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Tr}(J_k) = \\mathrm{Tr}(J) - k^2(D_u + D_v) < 0$ is always satisfied.\nThis means any instability must arise from the determinant condition. An instability occurs if $\\det(J_k)$ becomes negative for some $k > 0$, which corresponds to one of the real eigenvalues becoming positive (a stationary bifurcation).\nThe condition for instability is $\\det(J_k) < 0$.\n\nLet $q = k^2 > 0$. The determinant becomes a quadratic function of $q$:\n$$h(q) = \\det(J_k) = (D_u D_v) q^2 - (f_u D_v + g_v D_u) q + \\det(J)$$\nWe know $h(0) = \\det(J) > 0$. For $h(q)$ to become negative for some $q>0$, the parabola, which opens upwards since $D_u D_v > 0$, must have a minimum value that is negative. The minimum must also occur at a positive value of $q$.\n\nThe minimum of the parabola $h(q)$ occurs at $q = q_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{f_u D_v + g_v D_u}{2 D_u D_v}$.\nFor a physical instability ($k$ must be real), we require $q_{\\text{min}} > 0$. This implies $f_u D_v + g_v D_u > 0$.\nThe value of the determinant at this minimum is $h(q_{\\text{min}}) = \\det(J) - \\frac{(f_u D_v + g_v D_u)^2}{4 D_u D_v}$.\nFor instability, we require $h(q_{\\text{min}}) < 0$, which leads to the condition:\n$$(f_u D_v + g_v D_u)^2 > 4 D_u D_v \\det(J)$$\n\nIn summary, the necessary conditions for a Turing instability are:\n$1$. $\\mathrm{Tr}(J) < 0$ and $\\det(J) > 0$ (stability in the absence of diffusion).\n$2$. $f_u D_v + g_v D_u > 0$ (destabilizing effect of differential diffusion).\n$3$. $(f_u D_v + g_v D_u)^2 > 4 D_u D_v \\det(J)$ (diffusion is strong enough to cause instability).\n\nNow we apply these conditions to the specific problem using $f_u=1$, $g_v=-3$, $\\det(J)=5$, $D_u=1$, and $D_v = \\delta$.\nCondition $1$ is already verified.\nCondition $2$: $(1)\\delta + (-3)(1) > 0 \\implies \\delta - 3 > 0 \\implies \\delta > 3$.\nCondition $3$: $( (1)\\delta + (-3)(1) )^2 > 4(1)(\\delta)(5) \\implies (\\delta - 3)^2 > 20\\delta$.\nExpanding the inequality:\n$\\delta^2 - 6\\delta + 9 > 20\\delta$\n$\\delta^2 - 26\\delta + 9 > 0$\n\nTo find when this inequality holds, we find the roots of the quadratic equation $\\delta^2 - 26\\delta + 9 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{-(-26) \\pm \\sqrt{(-26)^2 - 4(1)(9)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{26 \\pm \\sqrt{676 - 36}}{2} = \\frac{26 \\pm \\sqrt{640}}{2} $$\nSince $\\sqrt{640} = \\sqrt{64 \\times 10} = 8\\sqrt{10}$, the roots are:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{26 \\pm 8\\sqrt{10}}{2} = 13 \\pm 4\\sqrt{10} $$\nThe parabola $\\delta^2 - 26\\delta + 9$ opens upwards, so the inequality is satisfied for $\\delta > 13 + 4\\sqrt{10}$ or $\\delta < 13 - 4\\sqrt{10}$.\n\nWe must satisfy both $\\delta > 3$ and ($\\delta > 13 + 4\\sqrt{10}$ or $\\delta < 13 - 4\\sqrt{10}$).\nLet's approximate the roots.

The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the minimum domain length for which an instability can occur, a question with a unique, determinable answer for each boundary condition. It provides all necessary information, as the instability condition is given directly in terms of the Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$, abstracting away the specific details of $f, g, D_u, D_v$.\n- **Objectivity and Clarity**: The problem is formulated in precise mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective assertions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the admissible eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator for each set of boundary conditions and identify the minimum domain length $L$ that allows at least one of these eigenvalues to fall within the prescribed instability band.\n\nThe analysis hinges on the eigenvalue problem for the one-dimensional negative Laplacian operator, $-\\partial_{xx}$, on the domain $(0, L)$:\n$$\n-\\partial_{xx}\\phi(x) = k^2 \\phi(x)\n$$\nHere, $\\lambda = k^2$ is the Laplacian eigenvalue mentioned in the problem statement. The problem states that instability occurs for modes where $\\lambda \\in [4, 9]$, which implies the corresponding wavenumber $k$ must satisfy $k^2 \\in [4, 9]$, or $k \\in [2, 3]$.\n\nWe shall now enumerate the admissible eigenvalues for each boundary condition. The general solution to the eigenfunction equation is $\\phi(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx)$.\n\n**(i) Enumeration of Admissible Laplacian Eigenvalues**\n\n**Dirichlet Boundary Conditions (D):**\nThe conditions are $\\phi(0) = 0$ and $\\phi(L) = 0$.\n$\\phi(0) = A\\sin(0) + B\\cos(0) = B = 0$.\nThe solution is of the form $\\phi(x) = A\\sin(kx)$.\n$\\phi(L) = A\\sin(kL) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we must have $kL = n\\pi$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. The case $n=0$ yields the trivial solution $\\phi(x)=0$.\nThe admissible wavenumbers are $k_n = \\dfrac{n\\pi}{L}$.\nThe admissible Laplacian eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n^{\\mathrm{D}}(L) = k_n^2 = \\left(\\dfrac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n**Neumann Boundary Conditions (N):**\nThe conditions are $\\phi'(0) = 0$ and $\\phi'(L) = 0$.\n$\\phi'(x) = Ak\\cos(kx) - Bk\\sin(kx)$.\n$\\phi'(0) = Ak = 0$. If we consider $k \\neq 0$, this implies $A=0$. The solution is of the form $\\phi(x) = B\\cos(kx)$.\n$\\phi'(L) = -Bk\\sin(kL) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($B \\neq 0, k \\neq 0$), we must have $kL = n\\pi$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\nIf $k=0$, the eigenfunction is $\\phi(x) = B$, a constant. This corresponds to the mode $n=0$. The eigenvalue is $\\lambda_0 = 0$. This mode represents a spatially uniform perturbation, which is stable by the problem's assumption that the well-mixed system is stable (and $0 \\notin [4,9]$).\nThe admissible wavenumbers are $k_n = \\dfrac{n\\pi}{L}$.\nThe admissible Laplacian eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n^{\\mathrm{N}}(L) = k_n^2 = \\left(\\dfrac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$.\n\n**Periodic Boundary Conditions (P):**\nThe conditions are $\\phi(0) = \\phi(L)$ and $\\phi'(0) = \\phi'(L)$. It is most direct to use complex exponential eigenfunctions, $\\phi(x) = C e^{ikx}$.\n$\\phi(0) = \\phi(L) \\implies C = C e^{ikL} \\implies e^{ikL} = 1$.\nThis requires $kL = 2n\\pi$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The derivative condition $\\phi'(0) = \\phi'(L)$ is automatically satisfied.\nThe admissible wavenumbers are $k_n = \\dfrac{2n\\pi}{L}$. Since $k_n^2$ is what matters, we can restrict to non-negative integers. The mode $n=0$ corresponds to $k_0=0$ and $\\lambda_0=0$, which is stable.\nThe admissible wavenumbers for non-trivial patterns are $k_n = \\dfrac{2n\\pi}{L}$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nThe admissible Laplacian eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n^{\\mathrm{P}}(L) = k_n^2 = \\left(\\dfrac{2n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$.\n\n**(ii) Identification of Critical Domain Size $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$**\n\nInstability occurs if, for a given length $L$, there exists an integer mode $n$ (from the admissible set for the given BCs) such that its eigenvalue $\\lambda_n(L)$ is in the interval $[4, 9]$.\nWe seek the smallest $L > 0$, denoted $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, for which this condition is met.\nThe condition is $4 \\le \\lambda_n(L) \\le 9$.\nSince $\\lambda_n(L)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $L$ for any fixed $n>0$, the threshold for instability (the smallest $L$) will occur when the eigenvalue of the \"fastest\" growing mode (the one with the smallest non-zero index $n$) first enters the instability band from above.\nThis happens when $\\lambda_n(L)$ first becomes equal to the upper bound, $9$.\nSo, for the first unstable mode (smallest non-zero $n$), we set $\\lambda_n(L_{\\mathrm{crit}}) = 9$.\n\n**For Dirichlet BCs:**\nThe first mode is $n=1$. We need $\\lambda_1^{\\mathrm{D}}(L) = \\left(\\dfrac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\le 9$.\nThe minimum $L$ that satisfies this is when equality holds: $\\left(\\dfrac{\\pi}{L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)^2 = 9$.\n$\\dfrac{\\pi}{L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{D}}} = 3 \\implies L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{D}} = \\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\n**For Neumann BCs:**\nThe first potentially unstable mode is $n=1$ (since $n=0$ is stable).\nThe eigenvalues for $n \\ge 1$ are identical to the Dirichlet case.\n$\\lambda_1^{\\mathrm{N}}(L) = \\left(\\dfrac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$.\nSetting this to $9$ gives $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{N}} = \\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\n**For Periodic BCs:**\nThe first potentially unstable mode is $n=1$.\nWe need $\\lambda_1^{\\mathrm{P}}(L) = \\left(\\dfrac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\le 9$.\nThe minimum $L$ occurs at equality: $\\left(\\dfrac{2\\pi}{L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{P}}}\\right)^2 = 9$.\n$\\dfrac{2pi}{L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{P}}} = 3 \\implies L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{P}} = \\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}$.\n\n**(iii) Identification of the First Unstable Mode**\n\nIn each case, the critical length $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ was found by considering the mode with the smallest non-zero index, which is $n=1$. This is because the functions $\\lambda_n(L)$ are ordered such that $\\lambda_1(L) < \\lambda_2(L) < \\ldots$ for any fixed $L$. As $L$ increases from $0$, all $\\lambda_n(L)$ decrease. The first eigenvalue to enter the band $[4, 9]$ will be $\\lambda_1(L)$. Thus, for all three boundary conditions, the first mode to become unstable is $n=1$.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n- $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{D}} = \\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$, first unstable mode $n=1$.\n- $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{N}} = \\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$, first unstable mode $n=1$.\n- $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{P}} = \\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}$, first unstable mode $n=1$.\n- Ordering of thresholds: $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{D}} = L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{N}} <L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{P}}$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{D}}=\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$, $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{N}}=\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$, $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{P}}=\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}$; in all cases the first unstable mode is $n=1$; ordering $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{D}}=L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{N}}<L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{P}}$.**\n    This statement perfectly matches our derived results for the critical lengths, the first unstable modes, and their ordering.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{D}}=\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}$, $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{N}}=\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$, $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{P}}=\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$; first unstable modes are $n=1$.**\n    This option lists $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{D}} = \\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{P}} = \\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$, both of which contradict our findings.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{D}}=L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{N}}=L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{P}}=\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$; first unstable modes are $n=1$.**\n    This option claims all three thresholds are equal to $\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$. This value corresponds to the domain length where the first mode for Dirichlet/Neumann conditions has an eigenvalue of $\\lambda_1 = (\\pi/(\\pi/2))^2 = 4$, which is the lower bound of the instability interval. The threshold, or onset, is determined by the upper bound. All stated values are incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{D}}=\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$, $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{N}}=\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}$, $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}^{\\mathrm{P}}=\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$; first unstable modes are $n=1$.**\n    This option incorrectly swaps the critical lengths for Neumann and Periodic boundary conditions.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nOnly option A is consistent with the derivation from first principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2691295"}]}
