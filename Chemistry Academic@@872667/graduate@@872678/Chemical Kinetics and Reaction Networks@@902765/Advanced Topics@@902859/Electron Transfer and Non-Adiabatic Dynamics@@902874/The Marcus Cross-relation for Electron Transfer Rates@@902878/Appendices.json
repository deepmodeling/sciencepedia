This is derived from the first-order approximation $d(\\ln x) = dx/x$. Thus, we can write:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{k_{12}}}{k_{12}}\\right)^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{k_{11}}}{k_{11}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{k_{22}}}{k_{22}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{K_{12}}}{K_{12}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{f_{12}}}{f_{12}}\\right)^2 \\right]$$\nSince $f_{12}$ is given as an exact number, its uncertainty $\\sigma_{f_{12}}$ is $0$. Therefore, the term involving $f_{12}$ vanishes:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{k_{12}}}{k_{12}}\\right)^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{k_{11}}}{k_{11}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{k_{22}}}{k_{22}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{K_{12}}}{K_{12}}\\right)^2 \\right]$$\nNext, we calculate the squared relative uncertainties for each variable:\n- For $k_{11}$: The central value is $1.00 \\times 10^7$ and the uncertainty is $\\sigma_{k_{11}} = 0.20 \\times 10^7$. The relative uncertainty is $\\frac{\\sigma_{k_{11}}}{k_{11}}} = \\frac{0.20 \\times 10^7}{1.00 \\times 10^7} = 0.20$. The squared relative uncertainty is $(0.20)^2 = 0.0400$.\n- For $k_{22}$: The central value is $4.00 \\times 10^6$ and the uncertainty is $\\sigma_{k_{22}} = 0.40 \\times 10^6$. The relative uncertainty is $\\frac{\\sigma_{k_{22}}}{k_{22}} = \\frac{0.40 \\times 10^6}{4.00 \\times 10^6} = 0.10$. The squared relative uncertainty is $(0.10)^2 = 0.0100$.\n- For $K_{12}$: The central value is $2.50$ and the uncertainty is $\\sigma_{K_{12}} = 0.30$. The relative uncertainty is $\\frac{\\sigma_{K_{12}}}{K_{12}} = \\frac{0.30}{2.50} = 0.12$. The squared relative uncertainty is $(0.12)^2 = 0.0144$.\n\nNow, we sum these values and substitute into our equation for the squared relative uncertainty of $k_{12}$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{k_{12}}}{k_{12}}\\right)^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 0.0400 + 0.0100 + 0.0144 \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} (0.0644) = 0.0161$$\nThe relative uncertainty in $k_{12}$ is the square root of this value:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_{k_{12}}}{k_{12}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.0161}$$\nTo find the absolute uncertainty $\\sigma_{k_{12}}$, we must first calculate the central value of $k_{12}$:\n$$k_{12} = \\left( (1.00 \\times 10^7) \\cdot (4.00 \\times 10^6) \\cdot (2.50) \\cdot (0.500) \\right)^{1/2}$$\n$$k_{12} = \\left( 5.00 \\times 10^{13} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( 50.0 \\times 10^{12} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{50} \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe absolute uncertainty is then the product of the central value and the relative uncertainty:\n$$\\sigma_{k_{12}} = k_{12} \\times \\frac{\\sigma_{k_{12}}}{k_{12}} \\approx \\left(\\sqrt{50} \\times 10^6\\right) \\times \\sqrt{0.0161}$$\n$$\\sigma_{k_{12}} \\approx 10^6 \\times \\sqrt{50 \\times 0.0161} = 10^6 \\times \\sqrt{0.805}$$\n$$\\sigma_{k_{12}} \\approx 10^6 \\times 0.8972179...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\sigma_{k_{12}} \\approx 8.97 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThis is the standard uncertainty in $k_{12}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.97 \\times 10^{5}}$$", "id": "2686786"}]}
