All necessary data and constants are provided, and the problem is free of internal contradictions or ambiguities. It is a standard problem in physical chemistry and can be solved rigorously. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the inner-sphere reorganization energy ($\\lambda_{\\text{in}}$), the outer-sphere reorganization energy ($\\lambda_{\\text{out}}$), and their ratio, $\\rho$.\n\nFirst, we address the inner-sphere reorganization energy, $\\lambda_{\\text{in}}$.\nThe system consists of an iron complex undergoing self-exchange between $\\text{Fe(II)}$ and $\\text{Fe(III)}$ oxidation states. The inner-sphere reorganization energy is the energy required to distort the reactant coordination shells into the equilibrium geometry of the product coordination shells. The problem specifies that each of the $N=6$ identical $\\text{Fe–N}$ bonds can be treated as an independent harmonic oscillator with a force constant $k$. For a single harmonic oscillator, the energy required to displace it by a distance $\\Delta r$ from its equilibrium position is $\\frac{1}{2} k (\\Delta r)^2$. The total inner-sphere reorganization energy for a self-exchange reaction is the sum of these distortion energies over all relevant vibrational modes. Given a uniform change of each $\\text{Fe–N}$ bond length by $\\Delta r$, the total inner-sphere reorganization energy is given by the sum over all $N$ bonds:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\text{in}} = N \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} k (\\Delta r)^2 \\right) = 3k(\\Delta r)^2 $$\nThe problem provides the following values in SI units:\nNumber of bonds, $N = 6$.\nForce constant, $k = 300 \\, \\text{N/m}$.\nChange in bond length, $\\Delta r = 0.040 \\, \\text{Å} = 0.040 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\lambda_{\\text{in}}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\text{in}} = 3 \\times (300 \\, \\text{N/m}) (4.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{m})^2 $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\text{in}} = 3 \\times (300) \\times (1.6 \\times 10^{-23}) \\, \\text{J} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\text{in}} = 900 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J} = 1440 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\text{in}} = 1.44 \\times 10^{-20} \\, \\text{J} $$\n\nSecond, we address the outer-sphere reorganization energy, $\\lambda_{\\text{out}}$.\nThis energy arises from the rearrangement of the solvent molecules surrounding the reactants. The electron transfer is fast compared to the nuclear (orientational) motion of the solvent, but slow compared to the electronic polarization of the solvent.

It provides all necessary parameters and relies on established theoretical frameworks, namely the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (Debye-Hückel) theory and Transition State Theory. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for the reversible work, $W(a)$, required to bring two point charges from infinite separation to a distance $a$ in an electrolyte solution. The electrostatic potential $\\phi(r)$ around a central point charge $q_{A} = z_{A}e$ in a medium with dielectric constant $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}$ and screening parameter $\\kappa$ is described by the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation:\n$$ \\nabla^{2}\\phi(r) = \\kappa^{2}\\phi(r) $$\nFor a spherically symmetric system, the general solution to this equation is the screened Coulomb potential, also known as the Yukawa potential:\n$$ \\phi(r) = C \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa r)}{r} $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. In the limit of zero screening ($\\kappa \\to 0$) or very short distances ($r \\to 0$), this potential must reduce to the standard Coulomb potential of a point charge in a dielectric medium, $\\phi(r) \\to \\frac{q_{A}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon r}$. This boundary condition determines the constant $C = \\frac{q_{A}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} = \\frac{z_{A}e}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}}$.\nThus, the potential created by charge $A$ at a distance $r$ is:\n$$ \\phi_{A}(r) = \\frac{z_{A}e}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}} \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa r)}{r} $$\nThe work $W(a)$ done to bring a second charge $q_{B}=z_{B}e$ from infinite separation ($\\phi_{A}(\\infty) = 0$) to a distance $a$ from the first charge is given by $W(a) = q_{B}\\phi_{A}(a)$. Substituting the expressions for $q_B$ and $\\phi_A(a)$, we obtain:\n$$ W(a) = (z_{B}e) \\left( \\frac{z_{A}e}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}} \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa a)}{a} \\right) = \\frac{z_{A}z_{B}e^{2}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r} a} \\exp(-\\kappa a) $$\nThis is the required expression for the reversible work.\n\nThe effective activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, represents the total free energy barrier starting from infinitely separated reactants. It can be decomposed into two successive steps: first, the work required to bring the reactants to the encounter distance $a$, which is the electrostatic work term $W(a)$; second, the intrinsic process of electron transfer at this fixed configuration, which involves structural and solvent reorganization and is characterized by the intrinsic activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{int}}$. As defined in the problem, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{int}}$ includes all contributions *other* than this initial work term. Therefore, the total effective barrier is the sum of these two contributions: $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{int}}+W(a)$.\n\nAccording to Transition State Theory (TST), the rate constant $k$ for a reaction is given by:\n$$ k = \\mathcal{A} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{k_{B}T}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\mathcal{A}$ is the pre-exponential factor, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nFor the outer-sphere ($\\mathrm{o}$) and inner-sphere ($\\mathrm{i}$) mechanisms, the respective rate constants are:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{o}} = \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{o}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{eff, o}}}{k_{B}T}\\right) = \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{o}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{int}} + W(a_{\\mathrm{o}})}{k_{B}T}\\right) $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{i}} = \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{i}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{eff, i}}}{k_{B}T}\\right) = \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{i}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{int}} + W(a_{\\mathrm{i}})}{k_{B}T}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that the pre-exponential factors are equal ($\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{o}} = \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{i}}$) and the intrinsic activation barriers are the same for both pathways.

It provides a set of standard experimental results for a known electron transfer reaction and asks for the mechanistic conclusion that is best supported by the data. The principles cited—transition state theory, the Brønsted–Bjerrum equation, and the definitions of inner-sphere and outer-sphere mechanisms—are a correct and relevant theoretical framework. The data are internally consistent and physically plausible. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles and is not ambiguous. Therefore, the problem statement is valid.\n\nWe now proceed to the solution. The core task is to distinguish between two primary mechanisms for electron transfer between coordination complexes: outer-sphere and inner-sphere.\n\n1.  **Outer-Sphere Electron Transfer (OSET)**: The electron tunnels between the oxidant and reductant without any change in their first coordination spheres. The reactants form a precursor complex, electron transfer occurs, and then the products separate. No covalent bonds are made or broken during the electron transfer step. The rate is governed by the Franck-Condon principle, which requires reorganization of the solvent and the internal coordinates of the reactants prior to electron transfer. The general scheme is:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Ox}_1 + \\mathrm{Red}_2 \\rightleftharpoons \\{\\mathrm{Ox}_1, \\mathrm{Red}_2\\} \\xrightarrow{k_{et}} \\{\\mathrm{Red}_1, \\mathrm{Ox}_2\\} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Red}_1 + \\mathrm{Ox}_2 $$\n\n2.  **Inner-Sphere Electron Transfer (ISET)**: A ligand is shared between the two metal centers, forming a covalently bridged intermediate. The electron is transferred through this bridging ligand. This mechanism requires that at least one of the reactants is substitutionally labile, allowing a ligand from one complex to coordinate to the other, or an external ligand to bridge them. Bond formation and bond breakage are integral to the mechanism. The general scheme is:\n    $$ \\mathrm{L}_n\\mathrm{M}^{\\mathrm{Ox}}-\\mathrm{X} + \\mathrm{M'}^{\\mathrm{Red}} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{L}_n\\mathrm{M}^{\\mathrm{Ox}}-\\mathrm{X}-\\mathrm{M'}^{\\mathrm{Red}} \\xrightarrow{ET} \\mathrm{L}_n\\mathrm{M}^{\\mathrm{Red}}-\\mathrm{X}-\\mathrm{M'}^{\\mathrm{Ox}} \\longrightarrow \\text{products} $$\n\nWe now analyze the provided experimental evidence in the context of these two mechanisms.\n\n**Analysis of Experimental Probe (1): Ligand Integrity**\nThe structural integrity of the $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_6\\right]^{4-}$ complex is probed. An inner-sphere mechanism would necessarily involve one of the cyanide ligands acting as a bridge between the iron center and the methyl viologen dication. This would form a transient species like $[\\mathrm{MV}-\\mathrm{NC}-\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_5]^{2-}$. Such a mechanism implies a temporary or permanent cleavage of an $\\mathrm{Fe}-\\mathrm{C}$ bond. The experimental results from IR, $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR, and HPLC-MS collectively demonstrate that the cyanide ligands remain bound to the iron center throughout the reaction. No free cyanide is detected, and no cyanation of the organic acceptor occurs. This is strong evidence *against* an inner-sphere mechanism and provides direct support for an outer-sphere mechanism, where the coordination spheres of the reactants are required to remain intact. The detection of the $\\mathrm{MV}^{+\\bullet}$ radical by EPR merely confirms the identity of the product and gives no mechanistic information by itself.\n\n**Analysis of Experimental Probe (2): Ionic Strength Dependence**\nThe dependence of the rate constant $k_2$ on ionic strength $I$ is described by the Brønsted–Bjerrum equation, which in its limiting law form is given by:\n$$ \\log_{10} k_2 = \\log_{10} k_0 + 2 A z_A z_B \\sqrt{I} $$\nHere, $k_0$ is the rate constant at zero ionic strength, $A$ is the Debye-Hückel constant ($\\approx 0.509\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1/2}$ in water at $298\\,\\mathrm{K}$), and $z_A$ and $z_B$ are the charges of the reacting ions. For the reaction $\\mathrm{MV}^{2+} + \\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_6\\right]^{4-}$, we have $z_A = +2$ and $z_B = -4$. The product of charges is $z_A z_B = (+2)(-4) = -8$.\nThe equation predicts that the slope of a plot of $\\log_{10} k_2$ versus $\\sqrt{I}$ should be negative. This means that as the ionic strength $I$ increases, the rate constant $k_2$ should decrease. This phenomenon is known as the primary kinetic salt effect. An increase in ionic strength provides a more effective screening of electrostatic interactions. For reactants with opposite charges, this screening stabilizes the separated ions more than it stabilizes the encounter complex (the activated complex), thus increasing the activation energy and decreasing the reaction rate.\nThe experimental data ($k_2$ decreases from $2.8\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at $I=0.010\\,\\mathrm{M}$ to $1.1\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at $I=0.50\\,\\mathrm{M}$) are in perfect qualitative agreement with this prediction. This confirms that the rate-determining step involves the interaction of the two oppositely charged ions, as expected for a bimolecular reaction. While this observation is consistent with an outer-sphere mechanism, it would also be expected for an inner-sphere mechanism, as the formation of the bridged precursor complex would also involve bringing together the oppositely charged ions. Thus, this evidence, while important, does not by itself distinguish between the two mechanisms.\n\n**Analysis of Experimental Probe (3): Bridging Ligand Probe**\nAn inner-sphere mechanism requires ligand substitution to form a bridge. The complex $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_6\\right]^{4-}$ is well-known to be substitutionally inert. If the reaction were to proceed via an inner-sphere pathway, it would be extremely slow unless a catalyst or alternative bridging ligand were available. The experiment tests this by adding excess pyridine, a potential ligand. If an inner-sphere pathway were accessible, pyridine could potentially substitute a cyanide ligand to form a bridged species, possibly accelerating the reaction if pyridine is a better bridging ligand. The experiment shows that pyridine has no effect on the reaction rate and is not incorporated into the product. This lack of reactivity towards substitution provides further, very strong evidence that the coordination sphere of the iron complex is not breached during the reaction. This is a classic test that points away from an inner-sphere mechanism.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe collected evidence points unequivocally to an outer-sphere mechanism.\n- Probe (1) shows the coordination sphere of the iron complex remains intact.\n- Probe (3) shows the iron complex is inert to substitution by an external potential bridging ligand.\n- Probe (2) is consistent with a bimolecular reaction between oppositely charged ions, as is the case in an outer-sphere mechanism.\n\nWe now evaluate the given options based on this conclusion.\n\n**Option A. The mechanism is outer-sphere: a negative primary salt effect for oppositely charged reactants, intact cyanide ligands throughout, and absence of ligand-transfer products collectively support electron transfer without bond-making or bond-breaking at the metal.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the mechanism as outer-sphere. It correctly cites the key evidence: the negative salt effect (Probe 2), the integrity of the cyanide ligands (Probe 1), and the absence of ligand transfer (Probes 1 and 3). It correctly concludes that this evidence supports a mechanism without covalent bond changes at the metal center, which is the definition of an outer-sphere reaction.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B. The mechanism is inner-sphere via a cyanide bridge: the decrease of $k_2$ with ionic strength indicates stabilization of a charged bridged activated complex; the absence of free $\\mathrm{CN}^-$ is not probative because cyanide may rapidly rebind.**\nThis statement proposes an inner-sphere mechanism, which is strongly contradicted by Probes (1) and (3). The claim that the ionic strength effect indicates a *bridged* complex is a misinterpretation; it only indicates an interaction between oppositely charged species. The argument to dismiss the lack of free $\\mathrm{CN}^-$ is a weak rebuttal against multiple, consistent pieces of spectroscopic evidence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C. The mechanism is inner-sphere because the observation of the organic radical $\\mathrm{MV}^{+\\bullet}$ by EPR implies transient covalent bond formation during electron transfer.**\nThis statement contains a logical fallacy. The formation of the radical product $\\mathrm{MV}^{+\\bullet}$ is a consequence of the one-electron reduction. Both inner-sphere and outer-sphere mechanisms for this reaction would produce the same final products. The identity of the product does not provide information about the pathway taken to form it, specifically whether covalent bonds were formed in the transition state. Therefore, observing the product radical does not imply an inner-sphere mechanism.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D. The mechanism cannot be outer-sphere because addition of pyridine does not accelerate the reaction; outer-sphere reactions require opening a coordination site on iron by external ligands to proceed rapidly.**\nThis statement is founded on a completely false premise. It is *inner-sphere* reactions that require substitution or the opening of a coordination site to form a bridge. Outer-sphere reactions, by definition, proceed with intact coordination spheres. The observation that pyridine has no effect is evidence *against* an inner-sphere mechanism and is fully consistent with an outer-sphere mechanism. The statement reverses the fundamental definitions of the two mechanisms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the provided experimental data and fundamental principles of chemical kinetics, only option A is consistent with all observations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2660084"}]}
