The changes in copy numbers for reactions $1, 2, 3, 4$ are given by the stoichiometric vectors $\\boldsymbol{s}_1 = (1, 0)^T$, $\\boldsymbol{s}_2 = (-1, 0)^T$, $\\boldsymbol{s}_3 = (-2, 1)^T$, and $\\boldsymbol{s}_4 = (2, -1)^T$. The general form of the CLE, using an independent Wiener process $\\mathrm{d}W_j$ for each reaction channel $j$, is:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\boldsymbol{s}_j a_j(\\boldsymbol{n}, t) \\mathrm{d}t + \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\boldsymbol{s}_j \\sqrt{a_j(\\boldsymbol{n}, t)} \\mathrm{d}W_j $$\nWriting this out for each species:\nFor $n_x$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}n_x = (a_1 - a_2 - 2a_3 + 2a_4)\\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{a_1}\\mathrm{d}W_1 - \\sqrt{a_2}\\mathrm{d}W_2 - 2\\sqrt{a_3}\\mathrm{d}W_3 + 2\\sqrt{a_4}\\mathrm{d}W_4 $$\nFor $n_d$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}n_d = (a_3 - a_4)\\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{a_3}\\mathrm{d}W_3 - \\sqrt{a_4}\\mathrm{d}W_4 $$\nwhere the propensities $a_j$ are functions of $n_x, n_d,$ and $t$ as defined in the problem statement.\n\n**b) Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) for $n_x$**\n\nThe variable $n_x$ is fast due to the large degradation rate $\\gamma$. The variable $n_d$ is slow as $k_d$ and $k_r$ are small. We perform a QSSA by assuming that $n_x$ equilibrates instantaneously to a value $n_x^*$ that depends on the current state of the slow variable $n_d$ and time $t$. We set the deterministic part of the CLE for $n_x$ to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}n_x}{\\mathrm{d}t}|_{\\text{det}} = a_1(n_d, t) - a_2(n_x) - 2a_3(n_x) + 2a_4(n_d) = 0 $$\nThe problem instructs to neglect the term from the slow dimerization reaction, $-2a_3(n_x) = -k_d n_x(n_x-1)$, relative to the fast degradation term, $-a_2(n_x) = -\\gamma n_x$. This approximation is justified because the ratio of their characteristic rates $k_d/\\gamma$ is small. However, we must retain the term $2a_4(n_d) = 2k_r n_d$. The QSSA equation thus simplifies to:\n$$ a_1(n_d, t) - a_2(n_x^*) + 2a_4(n_d) = 0 $$\n$$ \\left(\\alpha_{0} + \\alpha_{a}\\,\\frac{n_{d}}{K + n_{d}}\\left[1 + \\epsilon \\cos(\\omega t)\\right]\\right) - \\gamma n_x^* + 2k_r n_d = 0 $$\nSolving for the quasi-steady-state monomer copy number $n_x^*$:\n$$ n_x^*(n_d, t) = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\left( \\alpha_{0} + 2k_r n_d + \\alpha_{a}\\,\\frac{n_{d}}{K + n_{d}}\\left[1 + \\epsilon \\cos(\\omega t)\\right] \\right) $$\n\n**c) Effective One-Dimensional Langevin Equation for $n_d$**\n\nTo obtain the effective dynamics for the slow variable $n_d$, we substitute the QSSA result into the CLE for $n_d$. A rigorous procedure involves averaging the propensities over the stationary distribution of the fast variable $n_x$, conditioned on the slow variable $n_d$.\nThe drift term is $f(n_d, t) = \\langle a_3(n_x) - a_4(n_d) \\rangle_{fast} = \\langle a_3(n_x) \\rangle_{fast} - a_4(n_d)$.\nFor a fixed $n_d$ and $t$, the dynamics of $n_x$ are approximated as a linear birth-death process with birth rate $B = a_1(n_d, t) + 2k_r n_d$ and death rate per molecule $\\gamma$. The stationary distribution of $n_x$ in this approximation is a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = B/\\gamma = n_x^*(n_d, t)$.\nThe average of the dimerization propensity $a_3(n_x)$ is:\n$$ \\langle a_3(n_x) \\rangle_{fast} = \\left\\langle k_d \\frac{n_x(n_x-1)}{2} \\right\\rangle_{fast} = \\frac{k_d}{2} \\langle n_x(n_x-1) \\rangle_{fast} $$\nFor a Poisson-distributed variable with mean $\\lambda$, the second factorial moment is $\\langle k(k-1) \\rangle = \\lambda^2$. Thus:\n$$ \\langle a_3(n_x) \\rangle_{fast} = \\frac{k_d}{2} [n_x^*(n_d, t)]^2 $$\nThe drift of the effective 1D Langevin equation for $n_d$ is therefore:\n$$ f(n_d, t) = \\frac{k_d}{2} [n_x^*(n_d, t)]^2 - k_r n_d $$\nThe diffusion intensity $g(n_d, t)$ is the sum of the averaged propensities for the reactions affecting $n_d$:\n$$ g(n_d, t) = \\langle a_3(n_x) \\rangle_{fast} + a_4(n_d) = \\frac{k_d}{2} [n_x^*(n_d, t)]^2 + k_r n_d $$\nThe resulting effective 1D Langevin equation is:\n$$ \\mathrm{d} n_{d} = \\left( \\frac{k_d}{2} [n_x^*(n_d, t)]^2 - k_r n_d \\right) \\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{\\frac{k_d}{2} [n_x^*(n_d, t)]^2 + k_r n_d} \\, \\mathrm{d}W_t $$\n\n**d) Explicit Expression for the Drift Term $f(n_d, t)$**\n\nThe final task is to provide the explicit closed-form expression for the drift $f(n_d, t)$. We substitute the expression for $n_x^*(n_d, t)$ from part (b) into the expression for $f(n_d, t)$ found in part (c):\n$$ f(n_d, t) = \\frac{k_d}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\left( \\alpha_{0} + 2k_r n_d + \\alpha_{a}\\,\\frac{n_{d}}{K + n_{d}}\\left[1 + \\epsilon \\cos(\\omega t)\\right] \\right) \\right]^2 - k_r n_d $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ f(n_d, t) = \\frac{k_d}{2\\gamma^2} \\left( \\alpha_{0} + 2k_r n_d + \\alpha_{a}\\,\\frac{n_{d}}{K + n_{d}}\\left[1 + \\epsilon \\cos(\\omega t)\\right] \\right)^2 - k_r n_d $$\nThis is the final expression for the drift term of the effective Langevin equation for the slow dimer dynamics, which is suitable for analyzing bistability and stochastic resonance in the system.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_d}{2\\gamma^2} \\left( \\alpha_{0} + 2k_r n_d + \\alpha_{a}\\,\\frac{n_{d}}{K + n_{d}}\\left[1 + \\epsilon \\cos(\\omega t)\\right] \\right)^2 - k_r n_d}\n$$", "id": "2659058"}, {"introduction": "The term \"resonance\" is used to describe several distinct phenomena where noise plays a constructive role. It is vital for a scientist to distinguish these based on their underlying mechanisms and statistical signatures. This practice challenges you to differentiate true Stochastic Resonance (SR), which relies on the interplay between noise and an external periodic signal, from Coherence Resonance (CR), which arises autonomously in excitable systems without external forcing.

The first network, System S, is a bistable switch that can be modeled at mesoscopic scale by a birth–death Chemical Master Equation (CME) with two stable concentration basins and an activation barrier between them. A weak sinusoidal modulation of an inflow concentration with period $T$ and amplitude $\\epsilon$ makes the barrier height slowly time dependent. The second network, System C, is an excitable activator–inhibitor kinetics (e.g., an Oregonator in the excitable regime) with a characteristic excursion and recovery time in the absence of periodic forcing. In both experiments, the only available time series are the times of discrete events: for System S, the residence durations $\\tau_{\\mathrm{res}}$ spent in a given basin between consecutive basin-crossing events; for System C, the interspike intervals $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ISI}}$ between successive noise-triggered spikes.\n\nYour goal is to propose an experimental diagnostic that uses only the event-time statistics to discriminate stochastic resonance (SR) in System S from coherence resonance (CR) in System C. Base your reasoning on first principles: for bistable switching under weak periodic modulation and weak noise, escape events are well described by Kramers-like rates extracted from the CME, and inter-event times can be modeled as renewal processes driven by time-dependent hazards.

The descriptions of stochastic resonance (SR) in a periodically forced bistable system and coherence resonance (CR) in an autonomous excitable system are canonical models in statistical physics. The use of Kramers-like escape rates, Chemical Master Equations, hazard functions, and renewal processes are standard, rigorous formalisms.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It defines two distinct physical systems and asks for a protocol to distinguish them based on their observable statistics. The provided idealizations ensure that a unique and meaningful distinction can be made.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative language, free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and the evaluation of the options.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core task is to identify a statistical signature in the event times that is unique to Stochastic Resonance (SR) in System S and absent in Coherence Resonance (CR) in System C, and vice versa.\n\n-   **System S (Stochastic Resonance)**: This system is characterized by the interplay of noise and a periodic external drive. The escape rate from a potential well, $k(t)$, is periodic with period $T$:\n    $$k(t) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta U_{0}-\\alpha\\,\\epsilon \\sin(2\\pi t/T)}{D}\\right)$$\n    The probability of an escape event is maximized when the barrier is lowest, i.e., at times $t$ where $\\sin(2\\pi t/T) = 1$. This causes the system's transitions to synchronize with the external drive. This synchronization has two primary consequences for the event-time statistics:\n    1.  **Phase Locking**: The times of the events $t_j$ will be correlated with the phase of the drive. The distribution of phases, $\\phi_j = (2\\pi t_j/T) \\pmod{2\\pi}$, will be non-uniform, showing peaks where the escape probability is highest.\n    2.  **Multimodal Residence Time Distribution**: The distribution of residence times, $p(\\tau_{\\mathrm{res}})$, will reflect the periodicity of the escape opportunities. If a transition does not occur during one cycle's window of high escape probability, it is most likely to occur during the next, or the one after. This leads to a multimodal distribution $p(\\tau_{\\mathrm{res}})$ with peaks separated by the period of the driving force. For a symmetric bistable system, where the system switches back and forth, the fundamental timescale is half the drive period, $T/2$. Thus, we expect peaks near integer multiples of this characteristic time.\n\n-   **System C (Coherence Resonance)**: This system is autonomous; there is no external periodic drive. The dynamics are governed by intrinsic properties: an excitable threshold, a noise-triggered \"spike,\" and a subsequent refractory period $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}}(D)$. The problem states the interspike interval $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ISI}}$ is the sum of the absolute refractory time and a random waiting time with a constant hazard rate $r(D)$.\n    1.  **No Phase Locking**: In the absence of an external periodic signal, there is no external clock for the system to synchronize with. Any phase $\\phi_j$ calculated with respect to an arbitrary period $T$ will be uniformly distributed.\n    2.  **Unimodal Interspike Interval Distribution**: The waiting time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{wait}}$ following the refractory period is exponentially distributed, with probability density $p(\\tau_{\\mathrm{wait}}) = r(D)e^{-r(D)\\tau_{\\mathrm{wait}}}$. The total interspike interval is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ISI}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}}(D) + \\tau_{\\mathrm{wait}}$. The probability density $p(\\tau_{\\mathrm{ISI}})$ is therefore a shifted exponential:\n        $$p(\\tau_{\\mathrm{ISI}}) = \\begin{cases} r(D) e^{-r(D)(\\tau_{\\mathrm{ISI}} - \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}}(D))} & \\text{if } \\tau_{\\mathrm{ISI}} \\ge \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}}(D) \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } \\tau_{\\mathrm{ISI}} < \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}}(D) \\end{cases}$$\n        This distribution is strictly unimodal, with a maximum at $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ISI}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}}(D)$ and an exponential tail. It has no periodic structure.\n\nWith these principles established, I will evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Estimate the phase of each event time relative to the drive, $\\phi_{j}=2\\pi t_{j}/T \\bmod 2\\pi$, and the residence-time density $p(\\tau_{\\mathrm{res}})$. Declare SR if the circular phase distribution is significantly non-uniform and $p(\\tau_{\\mathrm{res}})$ is multimodal with peaks near $nT/2$ for $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, consistent with a $T$-periodic hazard; declare CR if phases are uniform and the interspike-interval density $p(\\tau_{\\mathrm{ISI}})$ is unimodal with a cutoff at $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}}(D)$ and no peaks at harmonics of $T$.**\n\nThis protocol proposes to check for the key signatures derived above.\n-   For System S (SR), it correctly identifies that the phase distribution must be non-uniform due to phase locking and that the residence time distribution $p(\\tau_{\\mathrm{res}})$ must be multimodal due to the periodic nature of escape opportunities. This is a definitive signature of SR.\n-   For System C (CR), it correctly identifies that the phase distribution relative to an external period $T$ must be uniform, and that the interspike interval distribution $p(\\tau_{\\mathrm{ISI}})$ must be unimodal with a sharp cutoff (the refractory period). This is a definitive signature of CR.\nThe proposed protocol is a direct and comprehensive test of the fundamental differences between SR and CR. The combination of phase analysis and interval distribution analysis provides a highly robust method of discrimination.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Compare mean event rates at putative resonance: declare SR if the mean switching rate equals exactly $2/T$ and declare CR if it equals exactly $1/T$; otherwise remain undecided.**\n\n-   For System S (SR), the condition that the mean residence time $\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_{\\mathrm{res}}]$ equals $T/2$, or equivalently that the mean rate is $1/\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_{\\mathrm{res}}] = 2/T$, is a time-scale matching condition for optimal SR. However, SR is a broader phenomenon observed over a range of parameters, not a state defined by an exact equality. This condition is an approximation for the peak of the resonance, not a strict law. Relying on an exact equality makes the protocol unreliable.\n-   For System C (CR), there is no external drive period $T$. Its mean event rate, $1/\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_{\\mathrm{ISI}}]$, is determined by intrinsic system properties and the noise level $D$. The condition that this rate equals $1/T$ (where $T$ comes from the other experiment) is completely arbitrary and has no physical basis.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Partition time into windows of length $T$ and compute the Fano factor $F$ of the event counts. Declare SR if $F>1$ and CR if $F<1$.**\n\nThe Fano factor, $F = \\mathrm{Var}(N_W) / \\mathbb{E}[N_W]$, measures the deviation of event-count variability from a Poisson process (for which $F=1$).\n-   For System S (SR), events are synchronized with the drive, causing them to cluster at specific phases. This temporal bunching increases the variance of counts in fixed windows, leading to a super-Poissonian statistic, $F > 1$.\n-   For System C (CR), the refractory period introduces regularity into the spike train, making it more ordered than a random process. This leads to a reduction in count variance compared to the mean, resulting in a sub-Poissonian statistic, $F < 1$.\nWhile this protocol captures an important statistical difference, it is less specific than option A. For example, a system could be intrinsically bursty (e.g., a non-driven system with complex dynamics) and exhibit $F>1$ without undergoing SR. Option A's test for phase locking would correctly identify that such a system is not experiencing SR. Therefore, option A is more robust because it probes the specific mechanism of synchronization with an external drive.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Turn off the periodic modulation and scan the noise intensity $D$ while measuring the coefficient of variation $\\mathrm{CV}=\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\tau)}/\\mathbb{E}[\\tau]$ of the intervals. Declare CR if $\\mathrm{CV}(D)$ exhibits a minimum at an intermediate $D$, because SR requires a drive and thus cannot show such a minimum.**\n\nThis protocol proposes an experiment on the un-driven systems.\n-   For System S with the drive off ($\\epsilon=0$), the potential barrier is constant. The escape process is a stationary Poisson process, and the residence times $\\tau_{\\mathrm{res}}$ are exponentially distributed. For an exponential distribution, $\\mathbb{E}[\\tau]=\\mu$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(\\tau)=\\mu^2$, so the $\\mathrm{CV}=1$ for all noise intensities $D$.\n-   For System C, the phenomenon of CR is defined by the emergence of maximal coherence (minimal $\\mathrm{CV}$) at an optimal non-zero noise level $D$. Therefore, observing a minimum in the $\\mathrm{CV}(D)$ curve is the definitive signature of CR.\nThis protocol correctly distinguishes between the *underlying physical systems*. However, the question asks to discriminate *SR in System S* from *CR in System C*. SR is a phenomenon that, by definition, only occurs when the drive is on. This protocol requires turning the drive off, thereby destroying the very phenomenon one is supposed to be identifying. It is a protocol to distinguish a bistable system from an excitable one, not to distinguish the phenomena of SR and CR as they are observed. Option A analyzes the phenomena directly in their defined operational states.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A provides the most robust and fundamentally sound protocol for distinguishing SR from CR using the specified observables. It directly tests for the defining characteristics of each phenomenon: synchronization with an external pacemaker for SR, and its absence for the autonomous dynamics of CR, complemented by analysis of the interval distributions which reflect the different underlying dynamics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2659060"}, {"introduction": "The definitive, hallmark signature of stochastic resonance is a non-monotonic relationship between an output Signal-to-Noise Ratio ($SNR$) and the input noise intensity. This capstone practice provides a complete, hands-on experience in computationally verifying this feature. You will implement a full pipeline that involves simulating a bistable system governed by a Langevin equation, performing spectral analysis to estimate the $SNR$ from the time-series data, and applying a robust decision rule to distinguish genuine SR from trivial deterministic entrainment. This exercise consolidates your theoretical knowledge by translating it into a practical computational workflow, from simulation to quantitative analysis and interpretation.", "problem": "Consider a bistable chemical reaction coordinate subject to thermal fluctuations and a weak periodic drive. You will work with a coarse-grained overdamped Langevin equation that models a bistable effective potential capturing two metastable chemical states. Your task is to design and implement a statistical decision rule that distinguishes genuine Stochastic Resonance (SR) from trivial deterministic entrainment by interrogating the dependence of the output Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) on the noise intensity. The decision must rely on first principles, and your program must: generate time series, estimate SNR at the drive frequency, assess the nonmonotonicity of SNR as noise intensity varies, and then decide whether SR is present or not. The final output for all test cases must be a single line containing a list of boolean values.\n\nFundamental base and modeling assumptions. Use the overdamped Langevin equation for a bistable reaction coordinate in a symmetric quartic potential with a sinusoidal driving force,\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x = \\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}x} + A\\cos(2\\pi f t)\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{2D}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t,\n$$\nwhere $x$ is the coarse-grained reaction coordinate, $U(x)$ is the potential, $A$ is the drive amplitude, $f$ is the drive frequency, $D$ is the effective noise intensity in the same units as $U(x)$, and $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process. Use the quartic potential\n$$\nU(x) = \\frac{a}{4}x^4 - \\frac{b}{2}x^2,\n$$\nwith $a>0$ and $b>0$ so that there are two wells near $\\pm \\sqrt{b/a}$. Work in nondimensional units with unit friction. The system is representative of a generic bistable reaction network near a slow reaction coordinate. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the drive frequency is defined from the power spectral density of $x(t)$ as the ratio of the spectral power at the drive frequency to the local spectral background at nearby frequencies estimated robustly.\n\nYour program must implement the following components:\n\n1) Time-domain simulation. Numerically integrate the stochastic differential equation using a standard time discretization scheme that is consistent with the overdamped Langevin dynamics for continuous-state chemical kinetics, and generate realizations $x(t)$ for different noise intensities $D$. Discard an initial transient and use the remainder to estimate the spectrum.\n\n2) SNR estimation. Using the discrete Fourier transform of $x(t)$, estimate the single-sided power spectral density and compute the SNR at the drive frequency $f$ as the ratio between the spectral power at the frequency bin nearest to $f$ and a robust estimate of the noise floor computed from neighboring frequency bins that exclude the drive bin. The SNR must be a positive real number.\n\n3) Statistical decision rule. Design a test that decides between the following:\n- Hypothesis $\\mathrm{H}_1$ (genuine Stochastic Resonance): $A$ is subthreshold so that SNR at $D\\to 0$ is small, and the SNR as a function of $D$ exhibits a nonmonotonic unimodal dependence with an interior maximum that exceeds the endpoint values by a scientifically meaningful margin. In the small $D$ range the SNR increases with $D$; in the large $D$ range it decreases with $D$.\n- Hypothesis $\\mathrm{H}_0$ (non-SR, including deterministic entrainment): Either SNR is high already at $D=0$ and shows no interior maximum attributable to noise, or SNR is monotonic over the tested $D$ range with no interior maximum of sufficient prominence.\n\nYour test must formalize the above by combining at least the following elements: (i) detection of a strict interior peak in SNR versus $D$ that is larger than both endpoints by a specified margin, (ii) a sign change in the discrete slope from positive (low $D$) to negative (high $D$) around the peak, and (iii) a check that, when $D=0$ is provided, the SNR at $D=0$ is small compared to the peak under $\\mathrm{H}_1$ but not under $\\mathrm{H}_0$. The final decision for each case must be a boolean: return $True$ if $\\mathrm{H}_1$ is accepted and $False$ otherwise.\n\nNumerical specifics. Use the following parameter set for the potential: $a=\\;1$ and $b=\\;1$. For the drive, use $f$ as specified per test case below. Simulate with time step $\\Delta t$ specified per case, total time $T$ specified per case, and discard the first $\\theta T$ with $\\theta=\\;0.1$ as transient. Express frequencies in inverse time units consistent with $t$ and $x$ dimensionless. When angles appear, they must be in radians. No physical units are required in the outputs because the outputs are booleans.\n\nTest suite. Your program must run the following four cases and output the decisions in the specified order:\n\n- Case $1$ (genuine SR expected): $A=\\;0.15$, $f=\\;0.05$, $D\\in\\{0.02,\\,0.05,\\,0.08,\\,0.12,\\,0.18\\}$, $\\Delta t=\\;0.02$, $T=\\;500$.\n- Case $2$ (deterministic entrainment expected): $A=\\;0.80$, $f=\\;0.05$, $D\\in\\{0.00,\\,0.02,\\,0.05,\\,0.08\\}$, $\\Delta t=\\;0.02$, $T=\\;500$.\n- Case $3$ (no drive; non-SR expected): $A=\\;0.00$, $f=\\;0.05$, $D\\in\\{0.02,\\,0.05,\\,0.08,\\,0.12\\}$, $\\Delta t=\\;0.02$, $T=\\;500$.\n- Case $4$ (monotonic over tested range; non-SR expected): $A=\\;0.10$, $f=\\;0.02$, $D\\in\\{0.005,\\,0.010,\\,0.020,\\,0.030\\}$, $\\Delta t=\\;0.02$, $T=\\;800$.\n\nAlgorithmic constraints. Use windowing in the spectral estimate to reduce leakage. The noise-floor estimate must exclude a symmetric neighborhood of at least $\\pm 2$ frequency bins around the drive bin. Use a robust statistic (for example, the median) for the noise floor over a band that does not include zero frequency. Your decision rule must be deterministic for the given random number generator seeds.\n\nFinal output format. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the four boolean decisions as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the cases above. For example, the printed line must look like\n$$\n[\\mathrm{True},\\mathrm{False},\\mathrm{False},\\mathrm{False}],\n$$\nbut with the actual decisions your method computes from the simulations.\n\nYour program must be completely self-contained: it must define all the parameters above, generate all data internally, and print only the final result line. No other output is permitted.", "solution": "The problem requires the design and implementation of a computational method to distinguish genuine Stochastic Resonance (SR) from deterministic entrainment or other non-resonant behaviors in a bistable chemical system. The analysis will be based on the system's response to varying thermal noise intensity. This requires simulating the system dynamics, performing spectral analysis to quantify the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and applying a principled decision rule based on the non-monotonic behavior of SNR which is the hallmark of SR.\n\nThe system's dynamics are modeled by the overdamped Langevin equation for a reaction coordinate $x(t)$, which is subjected to a potential force, a periodic driving force, and stochastic thermal fluctuations:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x = \\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} + A\\cos(2\\pi f t)\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{2D}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nHere, $x$ is the dimensionless reaction coordinate, $t$ is dimensionless time, $U(x)$ is the bistable potential, $A$ is the amplitude and $f$ is the frequency of the external periodic drive, $D$ is the noise intensity representing thermal energy, and $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process modeling white noise. The potential is a symmetric quartic double-well, given by:\n$$\nU(x) = \\frac{a}{4}x^4 - \\frac{b}{2}x^2\n$$\nWith the specified parameters $a=1$ and $b=1$, the potential becomes $U(x) = \\frac{1}{4}x^4 - \\frac{1}{2}x^2$. This potential has two stable minima at $x = \\pm\\sqrt{b/a} = \\pm 1$, corresponding to two metastable chemical states. These states are separated by a potential barrier at $x=0$ with a height of $\\Delta U = U(0) - U(\\pm 1) = 0 - (\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nTo simulate the system's evolution, we must numerically integrate the stochastic differential equation (SDE). The first-order Euler-Maruyama method is a standard and suitable choice for this task. The discretized update rule for the coordinate $x$ at time step $i$ is:\n$$\nx_{i+1} = x_i + \\left[ -(ax_i^3 - bx_i) + A\\cos(2\\pi f t_i) \\right] \\Delta t + \\sqrt{2D\\Delta t} Z_i\n$$\nwhere $t_i = i\\Delta t$, $\\Delta t$ is the time step, and $Z_i$ is a random variable drawn from a standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Each simulation is run for a total time $T$, and the initial $10\\%$ of the generated time series is discarded as a transient period to ensure the analysis is performed on the statistically stationary state of the system, starting from an initial condition $x(0)=-1$.\n\nThe Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is the key metric for detecting SR. It is estimated from the power spectral density (PSD) of the stationary time series of $x(t)$. The procedure is as follows:\n1.  A Hanning window is applied to the time series data to reduce spectral leakage, which is an artifact of the finite-time Fourier analysis.\n2.  The one-sided PSD is calculated using the real Fast Fourier Transform (`rfft`) of the windowed data. The power $P_k$ at the $k$-th frequency bin is proportional to the squared magnitude of the corresponding Fourier coefficient, $|X_k|^2$.\n3.  The signal power, $S_{sig}$, is defined as the power contained in the single frequency bin $k_f$ that is closest to the external drive frequency $f$.\n4.  The noise power, $S_{noise}$, is a robust estimation of the spectral background near the signal frequency. It is calculated as the median of the power values in a band of frequencies surrounding the signal bin $k_f$. To avoid contamination from the signal peak, a region of $\\pm 2$ bins around $k_f$ is excluded from this calculation.\n5.  The SNR is the dimensionless ratio $SNR = S_{sig} / S_{noise}$.\n\nThe final step is to apply a decision rule to the computed SNR values as a function of noise intensity $D$. For each test case, the SNR is calculated for a given set of $D$ values, $\\{D_j\\}$. The resulting curve, $\\text{SNR}(D)$, is analyzed to determine if SR is present.\n\nHypothesis $\\mathrm{H}_1$ (genuine SR) is accepted if the $\\text{SNR}(D)$ curve exhibits a statistically significant, non-monotonic, unimodal peak. This is formalized by the following conjunctive criteria:\n1.  **Interior Peak**: The maximum SNR must occur at a noise intensity $D_{peak}$ that is strictly between the minimum and maximum tested $D$ values. If the maximum SNR is found at either endpoint of the $D$ range, the behavior is considered monotonic over the tested range, and $\\mathrm{H}_1$ is rejected.\n2.  **Peak Prominence**: The SR peak must be significantly larger than the background signal response at the range boundaries. We quantify this by requiring the maximum SNR, $\\text{SNR}_{max}$, to be greater than the endpoint SNRs by a margin factor $R_{margin}$. The condition is $\\text{SNR}_{max} > R_{margin} \\cdot \\text{SNR}_{first}$ and $\\text{SNR}_{max} > R_{margin} \\cdot \\text{SNR}_{last}$. A value of $R_{margin}=1.25$ is chosen for this rule.\n3.  **Subthreshold Condition**: A strong, or \"suprathreshold\", drive can cause periodic switching even without noise ($D=0$), leading to a high SNR at $D=0$. This is deterministic entrainment, not SR. To distinguish this, if $D=0$ is part of the test set, we impose a stricter requirement: the peak SNR must be substantially greater than the SNR at zero noise. The condition is $\\text{SNR}_{max} > R_{sub} \\cdot \\text{SNR}_{D=0}$, with a chosen margin $R_{sub}=2.0$.\n\nIf all applicable conditions are met for a given test case, the result is `True`, indicating SR. Otherwise, the result is `False`. This deterministic rule, based on physical principles of SR, allows for a robust and reproducible classification of the system's behavior across the provided test cases.
