The assay contains a large number of enzyme molecules that are non-interacting and are exposed to a uniform, time-invariant substrate concentration $[S]$ due to a large substrate reservoir. The enzyme population exhibits static disorder (population heterogeneity): a fraction $p \\in (0,1)$ of the molecules belong to subpopulation $1$ with Michaelis constant $K_{M,1}$, and the remaining fraction $1-p$ belong to subpopulation $2$ with Michaelis constant $K_{M,2} \\neq K_{M,1}$.

It is a valid problem in chemical kinetics, specifically concerning the effects of static disorder on ensemble-averaged enzyme reaction rates. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental starting point is the Michaelis-Menten rate law derived under the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) for a homogeneous enzyme population. For an enzyme with total concentration $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, catalytic turnover constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, and Michaelis constant $K_M$, the initial rate of product formation $v$ at a substrate concentration $[S]$ is:\n$$v([S]) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nThis equation will be applied to each subpopulation and to the hypothetical homogeneous population.\n\nFirst, we construct the expression for the ensemble-averaged initial rate for the heterogeneous population, $v_{\\mathrm{het}}([S])$. The total enzyme population, with concentration $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is a mixture of two subpopulations that do not interact. The total rate is the sum of the rates contributed by each subpopulation.\nSubpopulation $1$ has concentration $[E]_1 = p [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, Michaelis constant $K_{M,1}$, and catalytic constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$. Its rate, $v_1([S])$, is:\n$$v_1([S]) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_1 [S]}{K_{M,1} + [S]} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} (p [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}) [S]}{K_{M,1} + [S]}$$\nSubpopulation $2$ has concentration $[E]_2 = (1-p) [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, Michaelis constant $K_{M,2}$, and the same catalytic constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$. Its rate, $v_2([S])$, is:\n$$v_2([S]) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_2 [S]}{K_{M,2} + [S]} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} ((1-p) [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}) [S]}{K_{M,2} + [S]}$$\nThe total rate for the heterogeneous mixture, $v_{\\mathrm{het}}([S])$, is the sum of these two rates:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{het}}([S]) = v_1([S]) + v_2([S]) = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [S] \\left( \\frac{p}{K_{M,1} + [S]} + \\frac{1-p}{K_{M,2} + [S]} \\right)$$\n\nNext, we construct the expression for the naive homogeneous initial production rate, $v_{\\mathrm{hom}}([S])$. This rate is calculated by assuming the entire enzyme population is homogeneous, with concentration $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, catalytic constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, and an arithmetically averaged Michaelis constant $\\overline{K}_{M}$. The problem defines this average as:\n$$\\overline{K}_{M} = p K_{M,1} + (1-p) K_{M,2}$$\nUsing this averaged parameter in the standard Michaelis-Menten rate law gives:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{hom}}([S]) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [S]}{\\overline{K}_{M} + [S]} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [S]}{(p K_{M,1} + (1-p) K_{M,2}) + [S]}$$\n\nNow, we must compute the zero-substrate-limit fold deviation, $r_0$, defined as:\n$$r_{0} \\equiv \\lim_{[S] \\to 0} \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{het}}([S])}{v_{\\mathrm{hom}}([S])}$$\nWe form the ratio using the expressions derived above:\n$$ \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{het}}([S])}{v_{\\mathrm{hom}}([S])} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [S] \\left( \\frac{p}{K_{M,1} + [S]} + \\frac{1-p}{K_{M,2} + [S]} \\right)}{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [S]}{(p K_{M,1} + (1-p) K_{M,2}) + [S]}} $$\nFor any non-zero substrate concentration $[S] \\neq 0$, the common factor $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} [S]$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out.

To present this in a single fraction, we find a common denominator for the first term:\n$$ \\frac{p}{K_{M,1}} + \\frac{1-p}{K_{M,2}} = \\frac{p K_{M,2} + (1-p) K_{M,1}}{K_{M,1} K_{M,2}} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $r_0$ gives the final analytical form:\n$$ r_0 = \\frac{\\left( p K_{M,2} + (1-p) K_{M,1} \\right) \\left( p K_{M,1} + (1-p) K_{M,2} \\right)}{K_{M,1} K_{M,2}} $$\nThis result can be interpreted as the product of the arithmetic mean of $K_M$ values, $\\overline{K_M}$, and the arithmetic mean of the reciprocal $K_M$ values, $\\overline{1/K_M}$.

This gives:\n$$ C_{\\mathbf{1}}(\\tau) = p(1-p) \\exp(-\\gamma |\\tau|) $$\nwhere $\\gamma = \\alpha+\\beta = 1/\\tau_c$ is the correlation rate. We now evaluate the double integral:\n$$ \\int_0^T \\int_0^T \\exp(-\\gamma |t_2 - t_1|) \\, dt_1 \\, dt_2 = \\frac{2}{\\gamma^2}(\\gamma T - 1 + \\exp(-\\gamma T)) $$\nThis is a standard result. Therefore, the variance of the integrated intensity is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}[\\Lambda_T] = k^2 p(1-p) \\frac{2}{\\gamma^2}(\\gamma T - 1 + \\exp(-\\gamma T)) $$\nCombining the terms for the total variance of $N(T)$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}[N(T)] = k p T + 2 k^2 p(1-p) \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}(\\gamma T - 1 + \\exp(-\\gamma T)) $$\n\nNow we use the definition of the long-time Fano factor $F_{\\infty}$:\n$$ F_{\\infty} = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}[N(T)]}{\\mathbb{E}[N(T)]} = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{k p T + 2k^2 p(1-p)\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}(\\gamma T - 1 + \\exp(-\\gamma T))}{k p T} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $k p T$:\n$$ F_{\\infty} = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{2k(1-p)}{\\gamma^2} \\left(\\gamma - \\frac{1}{T} + \\frac{\\exp(-\\gamma T)}{T}\\right) \\right) $$\nTaking the limit as $T \\to \\infty$, the terms multiplied by $1/T$ and $\\exp(-\\gamma T)/T$ vanish, yielding:\n$$ F_{\\infty} = 1 + \\frac{2k(1-p)}{\\gamma} $$\nThis result shows that the Fano factor's deviation from the Poisson value of $1$ is due to the stochastic switching of the enzyme, quantified by the rates $k$ and $\\gamma$ and the occupation probability $p$.\n\nWe have two equations relating the microscopic parameters to the macroscopic observables:\n1.  $m = kp$\n2.  $F_{\\infty} = 1 + \\frac{2k(1-p)}{\\gamma}$\n\nOur objective is to find $k$. We eliminate the unobserved parameter $p$. From the first equation, $p = m/k$. We substitute this into the second equation:\n$$ F_{\\infty} = 1 + \\frac{2k(1 - m/k)}{\\gamma} = 1 + \\frac{2(k-m)}{\\gamma} $$\nNow, we solve for $k$:\n$$ F_{\\infty} - 1 = \\frac{2(k-m)}{\\gamma} $$\n$$ \\gamma(F_{\\infty} - 1) = 2(k-m) $$\n$$ k-m = \\frac{\\gamma}{2}(F_{\\infty} - 1) $$\n$$ k = m + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}(F_{\\infty} - 1) $$\nFinally, using the given relation $\\gamma = 1/\\tau_c$, we arrive at the desired expression for $k$ in terms of the measurable quantities:\n$$ k = m + \\frac{F_{\\infty} - 1}{2\\tau_c} $$\n\nThe final step is to substitute the provided numerical values: $m = 3.0 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $F_{\\infty} = 2.2$, and $\\tau_c = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{s}$.\n$$ k = 3.0 + \\frac{2.2 - 1}{2 \\times 0.5} $$\n$$ k = 3.0 + \\frac{1.2}{1.0} $$\n$$ k = 3.0 + 1.2 = 4.2 $$\nThe units are in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as expected for a catalytic rate. The problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures. This gives $4.200$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.200}$$", "id": "2677167"}]}
