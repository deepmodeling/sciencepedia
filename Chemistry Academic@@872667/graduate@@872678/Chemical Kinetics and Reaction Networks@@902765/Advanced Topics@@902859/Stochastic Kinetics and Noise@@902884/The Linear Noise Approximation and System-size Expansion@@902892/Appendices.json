Calculation of the Variance**\nThe stationary probability distribution for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a Gaussian with mean zero and variance $\\sigma_\\xi^2 = \\text{Var}(\\xi)$. This variance is given by the fluctuation-dissipation relation:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\xi^2 = \\frac{B}{2\\alpha}\n$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $\\alpha$ and $B$:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\xi^2 = \\frac{2(a-d)/b}{2 \\cdot d(a-d)/a} = \\frac{(a-d)/b}{d(a-d)/a} = \\frac{a-d}{b} \\cdot \\frac{a}{d(a-d)} = \\frac{a}{bd}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the variance of the population number $n$. Using the relation $n = V\\phi_{ss} + \\sqrt{V}\\xi$, and noting that $V\\phi_{ss}$ is a constant in the stationary state:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(n) = \\text{Var}(V\\phi_{ss} + \\sqrt{V}\\xi) = \\text{Var}(\\sqrt{V}\\xi) = V \\cdot \\text{Var}(\\xi) = V\\sigma_\\xi^2\n$$\nFinally, we obtain the stationary variance of the population size:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(n) = V \\frac{a}{bd}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{V \\frac{a}{bd}}\n$$", "id": "697741"}]}
