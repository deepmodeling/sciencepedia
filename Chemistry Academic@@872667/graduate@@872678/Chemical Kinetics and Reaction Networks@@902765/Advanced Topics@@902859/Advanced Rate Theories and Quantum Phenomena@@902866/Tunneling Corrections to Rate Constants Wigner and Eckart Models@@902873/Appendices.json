The ratio of these TST rate constants correctly recovers the equilibrium constant:\n$$\\frac{k_f^{\\text{TST}}}{k_r^{\\text{TST}}} = \\frac{Q_B}{Q_A} = K_{eq}$$\nA key tenet of TST is the principle of microreversibility, which states that the forward and reverse reactions proceed through the exact same transition state structure and along the same minimum energy path on the potential energy surface. Consequently, any correction for quantum mechanical tunneling, which accounts for the system's ability to traverse the potential energy barrier, must be identical for both the forward and reverse directions.
