The species are ordered as $(A, B, C)$, which dictates the basis for our vector representation in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\nFirst, we identify the distinct complexes of the network. A complex is a unique linear combination of species appearing as either a reactant or a product in a reaction. We represent each complex as a vector in $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}^{3}$ corresponding to the counts of $(A, B, C)$.\n\nThe reactions are:\n1.  $A+2B \\to 3C$\n2.  $C \\to A+B$\n3.  $B \\to 0$\n\nFrom these, we extract the complexes:\n-   Reactant of R1: $1 \\cdot A + 2 \\cdot B + 0 \\cdot C \\implies y_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n-   Product of R1: $0 \\cdot A + 0 \\cdot B + 3 \\cdot C \\implies y_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n-   Reactant of R2: $0 \\cdot A + 0 \\cdot B + 1 \\cdot C \\implies y_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n-   Product of R2: $1 \\cdot A + 1 \\cdot B + 0 \\cdot C \\implies y_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n-   Reactant of R3: $0 \\cdot A + 1 \\cdot B + 0 \\cdot C \\implies y_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n-   Product of R3 (the zero complex): $0 \\cdot A + 0 \\cdot B + 0 \\cdot C \\implies y_6 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe set of distinct complexes, $\\mathcal{C}$, is the collection of these unique vectors:\n$$ \\mathcal{C} = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\} $$\nThe number of distinct complexes is the cardinality of this set, which is $n = |\\mathcal{C}| = 6$.\n\nSecond, we determine the number of linkage classes, denoted by $\\ell$. A linkage class is a connected component of the complex graph, where the directions of the reaction edges are disregarded. The reactions induce the following edges between the complex vectors:\n-   $y_1 \\to y_2$: $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\to \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n-   $y_3 \\to y_4$: $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\to \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n-   $y_5 \\to y_6$: $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\to \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nInspection of these edges reveals that there are no shared complexes between the three reactions. The complex graph thus consists of three disjoint components. The linkage classes are:\n-   $L_1 = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$\n-   $L_2 = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$\n-   $L_3 = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$\nTherefore, the number of linkage classes is $\\ell = 3$.\n\nThird, we compute the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace, $s$. This subspace, denoted $S$, is the linear span of the reaction vectors. Each reaction vector is the difference between its product complex vector and its reactant complex vector.\n-   For $A+2B \\to 3C$: $v_1 = y_2 - y_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n-   For $C \\to A+B$: $v_2 = y_4 - y_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n-   For $B \\to 0$: $v_3 = y_6 - y_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe stoichiometric subspace is $S = \\text{span}\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. Its dimension, $s = \\dim(S)$, is the rank of the matrix whose columns are these reaction vectors. Let this matrix be $M$:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -2 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 3 & -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo find the rank, we can evaluate the determinant of $M$.\n$$ \\det(M) = -1 \\begin{vmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} - 1 \\begin{vmatrix} -2 & -1 \\\\ 3 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} + 0 = -1((1)(0) - (-1)(-1)) - 1((-2)(0) - (-1)(3)) = -1(-1) - 1(3) = 1 - 3 = -2 $$\nSince $\\det(M) \\neq 0$, the vectors $v_1, v_2, v_3$ are linearly independent. The dimension of the space spanned by these three vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is therefore $s = 3$.\n\nFinally, we compute the deficiency of the network, $\\delta$. The deficiency is a non-negative integer defined by the fundamental relation:\n$$ \\delta = n - \\ell - s $$\nwhere $n$ is the number of complexes, $\\ell$ is the number of linkage classes, and $s$ is the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace.

The problem provides a reaction network, a set of species, and a list of core definitions from chemical reaction network theory. These definitions for complexes, the complex graph, weak reversibility, the stoichiometric subspace, deficiency, flux, and complex-balanced equilibrium are standard and mathematically precise. The reaction network itself, $2A \\;\\;\\xrightleftharpoons[k_{21}]{k_{12}}\\;\\; A + B \\;\\;\\xrightleftharpoons[k_{32}]{k_{23}}\\;\\; 2B$, is a simple, well-defined chemical system. The problem asks for an analysis of this network using only the provided definitions, which is a rigorous and self-contained task. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no discernible flaws. We therefore proceed to the solution.\n\nThe analysis will be conducted by systematically applying the given definitions.\n\n1.  **Complexes and Species:**\n    The chemical species are $A$ and $B$. We can represent the state of the system by a vector of concentrations $x = (c_A, c_B)^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    The complexes are the distinct chemical entities on either side of the reaction arrows. There are three such entities:\n    -   Complex $y_1 = 2A$, which corresponds to the vector representation $(2, 0)^T$.\n    -   Complex $y_2 = A+B$, which corresponds to the vector representation $(1, 1)^T$.\n    -   Complex $y_3 = 2B$, which corresponds to the vector representation $(0, 2)^T$.\n    The number of complexes is $n=3$.\n\n2.  **Complex Graph, Linkage Classes, and Weak Reversibility:**\n    The complex graph has nodes corresponding to the complexes $\\{y_1, y_2, y_3\\}$. The reactions define the directed edges:\n    -   $2A \\xrightarrow{k_{12}} A+B$ corresponds to an edge $y_1 \\to y_2$.\n    -   $A+B \\xrightarrow{k_{21}} 2A$ corresponds to an edge $y_2 \\to y_1$.\n    -   $A+B \\xrightarrow{k_{23}} 2B$ corresponds to an edge $y_2 \\to y_3$.\n    -   $2B \\xrightarrow{k_{32}} A+B$ corresponds to an edge $y_3 \\to y_2$.\n    The graph is $y_1 \\leftrightarrow y_2 \\leftrightarrow y_3$.\n    A linkage class is a connected component of the undirected version of this graph. As all three nodes are connected, there is only one linkage class: $\\{y_1, y_2, y_3\\}$. Thus, the number of linkage classes is $\\ell=1$.\n    A network is weakly reversible if every linkage class is strongly connected. Our single linkage class contains the entire graph. We check for strong connectivity: there is a directed path from any node to any other node (e.g., $y_1 \\to y_2 \\to y_3$ and $y_3 \\to y_2 \\to y_1$). Therefore, the linkage class is strongly connected, and the network is **weakly reversible**.\n\n3.  **Stoichiometric Subspace and its Dimension:**\n    The stoichiometric subspace $S$ is the linear span of the reaction vectors. A reaction vector is defined as (product complex) - (reactant complex).\n    -   For $y_1 \\rightleftharpoons y_2$: the vector is $y_2 - y_1 = (1, 1)^T - (2, 0)^T = (-1, 1)^T$. The reverse reaction gives the negative of this vector, which does not add a new dimension.\n    -   For $y_2 \\rightleftharpoons y_3$: the vector is $y_3 - y_2 = (0, 2)^T - (1, 1)^T = (-1, 1)^T$. Again, the reverse reaction gives the negative.\n    All reaction vectors are multiples of the same vector $(-1, 1)^T$.\n    The stoichiometric subspace is $S = \\text{span}\\{(-1, 1)^T\\}$.\n    The dimension of this subspace is $s = \\dim(S) = 1$.\n\n4.  **Deficiency Calculation:**\n    The deficiency, $\\delta$, is defined as $\\delta = n - \\ell - s$.\n    Using our calculated values: $n=3$, $\\ell=1$, and $s=1$.\n    $\\delta = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1$.\n    The deficiency of the network is $\\delta = 1$.\n\n5.  **Complex-Balanced Equilibrium:**\n    A positive concentration vector $x^* = (c_A^*, c_B^*)^T$ with $c_A^* > 0, c_B^* > 0$ is complex-balanced if, for every complex, the sum of incoming reaction fluxes equals the sum of outgoing reaction fluxes. Let us write the mass-action fluxes:\n    -   Flux from $y_1$: $v_{1 \\to 2}(x^*) = k_{12}(c_A^*)^2$.\n    -   Fluxes from $y_2$: $v_{2 \\to 1}(x^*) = k_{21}c_A^* c_B^*$ and $v_{2 \\to 3}(x^*) = k_{23}c_A^* c_B^*$.\n    -   Flux from $y_3$: $v_{3 \\to 2}(x^*) = k_{32}(c_B^*)^2$.\n    The complex balance equations are:\n    -   Balance at $y_1$: $k_{12}(c_A^*)^2 = k_{21}c_A^* c_B^*$\n    -   Balance at $y_2$: $k_{21}c_A^* c_B^* + k_{23}c_A^* c_B^* = k_{12}(c_A^*)^2 + k_{32}(c_B^*)^2$\n    -   Balance at $y_3$: $k_{32}(c_B^*)^2 = k_{23}c_A^* c_B^*$\n    Since we seek a positive equilibrium ($c_A^*, c_B^* > 0$), we can simplify the first and third equations:\n    1. From balance at $y_1$: $k_{12}c_A^* = k_{21}c_B^* \\implies \\frac{c_A^*}{c_B^*} = \\frac{k_{21}}{k_{12}}$.\n    2. From balance at $y_3$: $k_{23}c_A^* = k_{32}c_B^* \\implies \\frac{c_A^*}{c_B^*} = \\frac{k_{32}}{k_{23}}$.\n    The second equation (balance at $y_2$) is redundant if the first and third hold, as it becomes an identity. For a solution to exist, the two expressions for the ratio $c_A^*/c_B^*$ must be consistent. This imposes a constraint on the rate constants:\n    $$ \\frac{k_{21}}{k_{12}} = \\frac{k_{32}}{k_{23}} \\;\\;\\iff\\;\\; \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}} = \\frac{k_{23}}{k_{32}} $$\n    A positive complex-balanced equilibrium exists if and only if this condition on the rate constants is met. Since the rate constants $k_{ij}$ can be any positive real numbers, this condition is not met for arbitrary choices. Thus, a positive complex-balanced equilibrium is **not guaranteed**.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. $\\delta = 1$, the network is weakly reversible, and a positive complex-balanced equilibrium is guaranteed for all positive choices of $(k_{12},k_{21},k_{23},k_{32})$.**\nOur analysis shows $\\delta = 1$ and the network is weakly reversible. However, a complex-balanced equilibrium is not guaranteed for all positive choices of rate constants. It requires a specific relation between them.\nTherefore, this statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. $\\delta = 1$, the network is weakly reversible, and a positive complex-balanced equilibrium exists if and only if the constraint $k_{12}/k_{21} = k_{23}/k_{32}$ holds; therefore complex balance is not guaranteed for arbitrary positive rate constants.**\nOur analysis confirms every part of this statement. We found $\\delta = 1$, the network is weakly reversible, and the existence of a positive complex-balanced equilibrium is conditioned on the equality $k_{12}/k_{21} = k_{23}/k_{32}$. This correctly implies that such an equilibrium is not guaranteed for arbitrary positive rate constants.\nTherefore, this statement is **Correct**.\n\n**C. $\\delta = 0$, the network is weakly reversible, and a positive complex-balanced equilibrium is guaranteed for all positive choices of $(k_{12},k_{21},k_{23},k_{32})$.**\nOur calculation showed $\\delta = 1$, not $\\delta = 0$. The Deficiency Zero Theorem, which would guarantee a complex-balanced equilibrium for a weakly reversible network, does not apply here.\nTherefore, this statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $\\delta = 1$, the network is not weakly reversible, and thus no positive complex-balanced equilibrium can exist.**\nOur analysis showed $\\delta = 1$, but it also showed the network is weakly reversible. The claim that it is not weakly reversible is false.\nTherefore, this statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $\\delta = 2$, the network is weakly reversible, but no positive complex-balanced equilibrium can exist for any positive choice of $(k_{12},k_{21},k_{23},k_{32})$.**\nOur calculation showed $\\delta = 1$, not $\\delta = 2$. Furthermore, we showed that a complex-balanced equilibrium can exist if the rate constants satisfy a certain condition.\nTherefore, this statement is **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2646253"}, {"introduction": "The structure of the complex graph provides a direct blueprint for a network's dynamic behavior, a connection elegantly captured by the Kirchhoff matrix, $A_k$.

Therefore, $[A_k]_{21} = k_1$. All other off-diagonal entries in this column are zero. The diagonal entry is $[A_k]_{11} = -k_1$.\n\nColumn $2$ (reactions from $C_2$):\nThere are two reactions from $C_2$: $C_2 \\to C_3$ with rate $k_2$ and $C_2 \\to C_4$ with rate $k_4$.

This requires finding all vectors $v = (v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4)^T$ such that $A_k v = 0$.

The variable $v_4$ does not appear in any equation, which means it is a free variable.\n\nThus, any vector $v$ in the kernel of $A_k$ must be of the form $v = (0, 0, 0, c)^T$ for some scalar $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

A strictly positive vector $v$ has all components $v_i > 0$. No vector in the kernel of $A_k$ is strictly positive, as the first three components are always zero. This is a direct consequence of the network structure, where $C_4$ is an irreversible sink. Any initial distribution of mass on complexes $\\{C_1, C_2, C_3\\}$ will eventually flow to and accumulate in $C_4$. The only steady-state distribution is one where all mass is in the sink state $C_4$. In this context, the term \"positive vector\" must be interpreted as a non-negative, non-zero vector, which is standard for representing physical quantities like concentrations or probabilities.\n\nWe seek a vector $v = (0, 0, 0, c)^T$ where $c > 0$.
