It presents a standard, formalizable exercise in chemical reaction network theory, using established definitions and principles without any factual or logical contradictions. All necessary information is provided. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid, and a solution is warranted.\n\nWe begin by systematically addressing each required task based on the foundational definitions of chemical reaction network theory.\n\nThe species of the system are $S_1 = A$ and $S_2 = B$. The complexes, in the specified order, are $C_1 = 2A$, $C_2 = A+B$, and $C_3 = 2B$. The ordered directed reactions are $R_1: C_1 \\to C_2$, $R_2: C_2 \\to C_1$, $R_3: C_2 \\to C_3$, and $R_4: C_3 \\to C_2$.\n\nFirst, we construct the complex composition matrix $Y$. This is a matrix of size (number of species) $\\times$ (number of complexes), which is $2 \\times 3$. The entry $Y_{ij}$ is the stoichiometric coefficient of species $S_i$ in complex $C_j$.\nFor $C_1 = 2A + 0B$, the first column is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $C_2 = 1A + 1B$, the second column is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $C_3 = 0A + 2B$, the third column is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nCombining these columns gives the matrix:\n$$Y = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nSecond, we construct the complex-incidence matrix $I$. This is a matrix of size (number of complexes) $\\times$ (number of reactions), which is $3 \\times 4$. Each column corresponds to a directed reaction, with a $-1$ for the source complex and a $+1$ for the product complex.\nReaction $R_1: C_1 \\to C_2$ corresponds to the column $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nReaction $R_2: C_2 \\to C_1$ corresponds to the column $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nReaction $R_3: C_2 \\to C_3$ corresponds to the column $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nReaction $R_4: C_3 \\to C_2$ corresponds to the column $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe resulting matrix is:\n$$I = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThird, we construct the weighted Laplacian on complexes, $A_k$. This is a square matrix of size (number of complexes) $\\times$ (number of complexes), so $3 \\times 3$. The off-diagonal entry $(A_k)_{ij}$ is the rate constant of the reaction $C_j \\to C_i$. The diagonal entry $(A_k)_{ii}$ is the negative sum of rate constants for all reactions originating from complex $C_i$.\nThe reactions and their rates are: $C_1 \\to C_2$ with rate $k_1$, $C_2 \\to C_1$ with rate $k_2$, $C_2 \\to C_3$ with rate $k_3$, and $C_3 \\to C_2$ with rate $k_4$.\nOff-diagonal entries: $(A_k)_{21} = k_1$, $(A_k)_{12} = k_2$, $(A_k)_{32} = k_3$, $(A_k)_{23} = k_4$. All other off-diagonal entries are $0$.\nDiagonal entries:\n$(A_k)_{11} = -(\\text{rate out of } C_1) = -k_1$.\n$(A_k)_{22} = -(\\text{rate out of } C_2) = -(k_2 + k_3)$.\n$(A_k)_{33} = -(\\text{rate out of } C_3) = -k_4$.\nThe matrix is therefore:\n$$A_k = \\begin{pmatrix} -k_1 & k_2 & 0 \\\\ k_1 & -(k_2+k_3) & k_4 \\\\ 0 & k_3 & -k_4 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nFourth, we compute the deficiency, $\\delta = n - \\ell - s$.\nThe number of complexes is $n=3$.\nThe number of linkage classes, $\\ell$, is the number of connected components in the reaction graph $C_1 \\leftrightarrow C_2 \\leftrightarrow C_3$. This graph is a single connected component, so $\\ell=1$.\nThe dimension of the stoichiometric subspace, $s$, is the rank of the stoichiometric matrix $S = YI$.\n$$S = YI = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe second row of $S$ is the negative of the first row. Thus, the rows are linearly dependent, and the rank of the matrix is $s = \\operatorname{rank}(S) = 1$.\nThe deficiency is $\\delta = n - \\ell - s = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1$.\n\nFifth, we derive the conditions for complex balance and detailed balance. Let the concentrations of species $A$ and $B$ be $c_A$ and $c_B$. The vector of mass-action monomials corresponding to the complexes $(C_1, C_2, C_3)$ is $\\psi(c) = (c_A^2, c_A c_B, c_B^2)^T$.\n\nA positive equilibrium $c^* = (c_A^*, c_B^*)^T$ (with $c_A^*>0$, $c_B^*>0$) is complex-balanced if $A_k \\psi(c^*) = 0$. This gives the system of linear equations in the variables $(c_A^*)^2$, $c_A^* c_B^*$, and $(c_B^*)^2$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} -k_1 & k_2 & 0 \\\\ k_1 & -(k_2+k_3) & k_4 \\\\ 0 & k_3 & -k_4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} (c_A^*)^2 \\\\ c_A^* c_B^* \\\\ (c_B^*)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis expands to three equations:\n1. $-k_1(c_A^*)^2 + k_2 c_A^* c_B^* = 0$\n2. $k_1(c_A^*)^2 - (k_2+k_3)c_A^* c_B^* + k_4(c_B^*)^2 = 0$\n3. $k_3 c_A^* c_B^* - k_4(c_B^*)^2 = 0$\nFor a positive equilibrium, we can divide by the non-zero concentrations. From equation (1), $k_1 c_A^* = k_2 c_B^*$, which implies $\\frac{c_B^*}{c_A^*} = \\frac{k_1}{k_2}$. From equation (3), $k_3 c_A^* = k_4 c_B^*$, which implies $\\frac{c_B^*}{c_A^*} = \\frac{k_3}{k_4}$.\nFor a positive solution to exist, these two expressions for the ratio of concentrations must be consistent:\n$$ \\frac{k_1}{k_2} = \\frac{k_3}{k_4} $$\nThis is equivalent to the algebraic condition $k_1 k_4 - k_2 k_3 = 0$. If this condition holds, then equation (2) is automatically satisfied, as it is a linear combination of equations (1) and (3). Thus, $k_1 k_4 - k_2 k_3 = 0$ is the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a positive complex-balanced equilibrium.\n\nNext, we examine the condition for detailed balance. A positive equilibrium $c^*$ is detailed-balanced if, for every reversible reaction step, the forward rate equals the reverse rate. The network consists of two reversible steps:\n1. $2A \\rightleftarrows A+B$: The detailed balance condition is $k_1 (c_A^*)^2 = k_2 c_A^* c_B^*$. For $c_A^*>0$, this gives $k_1 c_A^* = k_2 c_B^*$, or $\\frac{c_B^*}{c_A^*} = \\frac{k_1}{k_2}$.\n2. $A+B \\rightleftarrows 2B$: The detailed balance condition is $k_3 c_A^* c_B^* = k_4 (c_B^*)^2$. For $c_B^*>0$, this gives $k_3 c_A^* = k_4 c_B^*$, or $\\frac{c_B^*}{c_A^*} = \\frac{k_3}{k_4}$.\nFor a single equilibrium point $c^*$ to satisfy both conditions simultaneously, we must have $\\frac{k_1}{k_2} = \\frac{k_3}{k_4}$, which is identical to the condition derived for complex balance.\n\nThe analysis confirms that for this network, the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a positive complex-balanced equilibrium is the same as that for a positive detailed-balanced equilibrium. This condition is $k_1 k_4 = k_2 k_3$. The polynomial expression that must equate to zero is therefore $k_1 k_4 - k_2 k_3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{k_{1}k_{4} - k_{2}k_{3}}$$", "id": "2634118"}, {"introduction": "A key distinction in reaction network theory is that between detailed balance, a true thermodynamic equilibrium, and complex balance, a more general non-equilibrium steady state.

A basis for $\\mathcal{S}$ can be formed by any two of these vectors, for instance $\\{v_{1}, v_{5}\\}$.\nSo, $\\mathcal{S} = \\mathrm{span}\\{(-1, 1, 0)^{\\top}, (0, -1, 1)^{\\top}\\}$. The dimension of $\\mathcal{S}$ is $2$.\n\nA conserved quantity is defined by a vector $w = (w_{1}, w_{2}, w_{3})^{\\top}$ in the orthogonal complement of the stoichiometric subspace, $\\mathcal{S}^{\\perp}$. Such a vector must satisfy $w \\cdot v = 0$ for all $v \\in \\mathcal{S}$. We test this with the basis vectors:\n$w \\cdot v_{1} = w \\cdot (-1, 1, 0)^{\\top} = -w_{1} + w_{2} = 0 \\implies w_{1} = w_{2}$.\n$w \\cdot v_{5} = w \\cdot (0, -1, 1)^{\\top} = -w_{2} + w_{3} = 0 \\implies w_{2} = w_{3}$.\nTherefore, any vector in $\\mathcal{S}^{\\perp}$ must be of the form $(c, c, c)^{\\top}$ for some constant $c$. We choose the basis vector $w = (1, 1, 1)^{\\top}$.\nThe conserved quantity is the dot product of this vector with the concentration vector $x = (x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3})^{\\top}$, which is $w \\cdot x = x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3}$. This represents the conservation of total concentration, a characteristic of a closed unimolecular network.\nThe value of this conserved quantity is determined by the initial concentration vector $x_{0} = (1, 2, 3)^{\\top}$.\n$$ C_{\\text{total}} = x_{1,0} + x_{2,0} + x_{3,0} = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} $$\nAny state $x(t)$ reachable from $x_{0}$ must lie in the positive stoichiometric compatibility class $x_{0} + \\mathcal{S}$, which is the set of vectors $x$ with positive components such that $x - x_{0} \\in \\mathcal{S}$. This is equivalent to satisfying the conservation law: $x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} = 6$.\n\nStep 2: Complex Balance Equations\n\nThe complex-weighted graph Laplacian, $A_{k}$, is a matrix whose entries are defined by the reaction kinetics. The element $(A_{k})_{ji}$ is the rate constant $k_{ij}$ for the reaction $C_{i} \\to C_{j}$ if $i \\neq j$. The diagonal element $(A_{k})_{ii}$ is the negative sum of rate constants for all reactions originating from complex $C_{i}$, i.e., $(A_k)_{ii} = -\\sum_{j \\neq i} k_{ij}$.\nThe rate constants are given: $k_{12} = 2$, $k_{21} = 1$, $k_{13} = 1$, $k_{31} = 2$, $k_{23} = 3$, $k_{32} = 3$. Units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ are omitted for matrix construction.\nThe entries of the $3 \\times 3$ matrix $A_{k}$ are:\n$(A_{k})_{11} = -(k_{12} + k_{13}) = -(2 + 1) = -3$.\n$(A_{k})_{22} = -(k_{21} + k_{23}) = -(1 + 3) = -4$.\n$(A_{k})_{33} = -(k_{31} + k_{32}) = -(2 + 3) = -5$.\n$(A_{k})_{21} = k_{12} = 2$.\n$(A_{k})_{31} = k_{13} = 1$.\n$(A_{k})_{12} = k_{21} = 1$.\n$(A_{k})_{32} = k_{23} = 3$.\n$(A_{k})_{13} = k_{31} = 2$.\n$(A_{k})_{23} = k_{32} = 3$.\n\nThus, the matrix $A_{k}$ is:\n$$ A_{k} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & -4 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 3 & -5 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe monomial map $\\psi(x)$ is a vector whose components are the mass-action monomials corresponding to each complex. For the unimolecular complexes $C_{1}=X_{1}$, $C_{2}=X_{2}$, $C_{3}=X_{3}$, the monomials are simply the concentrations:\n$\\psi_{1}(x) = x_{1}$, $\\psi_{2}(x) = x_{2}$, $\\psi_{3}(x) = x_{3}$.\nSo, $\\psi(x) = (x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3})^{\\top} = x$.\nA complex-balanced equilibrium is a steady state $x^{\\ast}$ where the rate of formation of each complex equals its rate of consumption. This condition is expressed by the equation $A_{k}\\,\\psi(x^{\\ast}) = 0$. For this network, the equation is $A_{k}\\,x^{\\ast} = 0$.\n\nStep 3: Solving for the Complex-Balanced Equilibrium\n\nWe must find the vector $x^{\\ast} = (x_{1}^{\\ast}, x_{2}^{\\ast}, x_{3}^{\\ast})^{\\top}$ that simultaneously solves the linear system $A_{k}\\,x = 0$ and the conservation constraint $x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} = 6$.\nThe system $A_{k}\\,x = 0$ is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} -3 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & -4 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 3 & -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\\\ x_{3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis gives a system of linear equations. As the columns of $A_k$ sum to zero, the rank of the matrix is at most $2$, and the equations are linearly dependent. We may use the first two equations:\n1) $-3x_{1} + x_{2} + 2x_{3} = 0$\n2) $2x_{1} - 4x_{2} + 3x_{3} = 0$\n\nFrom equation (1), we express $x_{2}$ in terms of $x_{1}$ and $x_{3}$: $x_{2} = 3x_{1} - 2x_{3}$.\nSubstitute this into equation (2):\n$2x_{1} - 4(3x_{1} - 2x_{3}) + 3x_{3} = 0$\n$2x_{1} - 12x_{1} + 8x_{3} + 3x_{3} = 0$\n$-10x_{1} + 11x_{3} = 0 \\implies 11x_{3} = 10x_{1} \\implies x_{3} = \\frac{10}{11}x_{1}$.\n\nNow, substitute this relation back into the expression for $x_{2}$:\n$x_{2} = 3x_{1} - 2\\left(\\frac{10}{11}x_{1}\\right) = 3x_{1} - \\frac{20}{11}x_{1} = \\left(\\frac{33 - 20}{11}\\right)x_{1} = \\frac{13}{11}x_{1}$.\nThe solution to $A_{k}\\,x=0$ is a vector where the components are in the ratio $x_{1} : x_{2} : x_{3} = 1 : \\frac{13}{11} : \\frac{10}{11}$, which is equivalent to $11 : 13 : 10$. Any such vector can be written as $x = \\alpha(11, 13, 10)^{\\top}$ for some scalar $\\alpha$.\n\nWe find the specific values by imposing the conservation law:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} = 6$\n$x_{1} + \\frac{13}{11}x_{1} + \\frac{10}{11}x_{1} = 6$\n$\\left(1 + \\frac{13}{11} + \\frac{10}{11}\\right)x_{1} = 6$\n$\\left(\\frac{11 + 13 + 10}{11}\\right)x_{1} = 6$\n$\\frac{34}{11}x_{1} = 6$\n$x_{1}^{\\ast} = 6 \\cdot \\frac{11}{34} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 11}{17 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{33}{17}$.\n\nNow we find the other concentrations:\n$x_{2}^{\\ast} = \\frac{13}{11} x_{1}^{\\ast} = \\frac{13}{11} \\left(\\frac{33}{17}\\right) = 13 \\cdot \\frac{3}{17} = \\frac{39}{17}$.\n$x_{3}^{\\ast} = \\frac{10}{11} x_{1}^{\\ast} = \\frac{10}{11} \\left(\\frac{33}{17}\\right) = 10 \\cdot \\frac{3}{17} = \\frac{30}{17}$.\n\nThe unique complex-balanced equilibrium concentration vector in the given compatibility class is $x^{\\ast} = (\\frac{33}{17}, \\frac{39}{17}, \\frac{30}{17})^{\\top}$. We verify the sum: $\\frac{33+39+30}{17} = \\frac{102}{17} = 6$, which is correct. The final answer must be given as a row matrix of these exact rational numbers.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{33}{17} & \\frac{39}{17} & \\frac{30}{17} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2634038"}]}
