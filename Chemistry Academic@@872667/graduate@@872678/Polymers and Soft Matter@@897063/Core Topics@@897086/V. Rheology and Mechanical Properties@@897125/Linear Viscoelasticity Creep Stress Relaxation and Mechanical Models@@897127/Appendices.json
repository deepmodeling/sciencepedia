The governing equation is correctly stated. The loading protocols are standard, with the ideal step strain being a common theoretical construct and the ramp-and-hold being its physically realizable counterpart. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with no contradictions or missing information. All terms are standard and clearly defined.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Stress Responses**\n\nThe constitutive equation for the Kelvin-Voigt model is:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = E\\,\\epsilon(t) + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) $$\n\n**Case 1: Ideal Strain Step**\nThe applied strain is $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0 H(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. The strain rate is the derivative, $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}[\\epsilon_0 H(t)] = \\epsilon_0 \\delta(t)$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta distribution. Substituting these into the constitutive equation gives the stress response:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = E\\,(\\epsilon_0 H(t)) + \\eta\\,(\\epsilon_0 \\delta(t)) = E\\,\\epsilon_0 H(t) + \\eta\\,\\epsilon_0 \\delta(t) $$\nFor times $t  0$, $H(t)=1$ and $\\delta(t)=0$. The stress is therefore:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = E\\,\\epsilon_0 \\quad (\\text{for } t  0) $$\nThe stress does not relax but remains constant. The delta function term signifies an infinite stress impulse at $t=0$, required to instantaneously strain the dashpot.\n\n**Case 2: Ramp-and-Hold Strain**\nThe strain history is piece-wise. We analyze each piece.\n\n-   **Ramp Phase ($0 \\le t \\le t_r$)**:\n    The strain is $\\epsilon(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t$. The strain rate is constant, $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}$.\n    The stress is:\n    $$ \\sigma(t) = E\\,(\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t) + \\eta\\,(\\dot{\\epsilon}) = E\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon} $$\n\n-   **Hold Phase ($t  t_r$)**:\n    The strain is constant, $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0$. The strain rate is zero, $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = 0$.\n    The stress is:\n    $$ \\sigma(t) = E\\,(\\epsilon_0) + \\eta\\,(0) = E\\,\\epsilon_0 $$\n\n-   **Stress at the transition time $t_r$**:\n    We evaluate the stress at the instant just before $t_r$, denoted $t_r^-$, and just after $t_r$, denoted $t_r^+$.\n    $$ \\sigma(t_r^-) = \\lim_{t \\to t_r^-} (E\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}) = E\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t_r + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon} $$\n    Using the definition $t_r = \\epsilon_0 / \\dot{\\epsilon}$, we have $\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t_r = \\epsilon_0$. Thus:\n    $$ \\sigma(t_r^-) = E\\,\\epsilon_0 + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon} $$\n    The stress immediately after the ramp stops is:\n    $$ \\sigma(t_r^+) = E\\,\\epsilon_0 $$\n    There is a stress drop at $t=t_r$ of magnitude:\n    $$ \\Delta\\sigma = \\sigma(t_r^-) - \\sigma(t_r^+) = (E\\,\\epsilon_0 + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}) - E\\,\\epsilon_0 = \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon} $$\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Under a strain step $\\epsilon(t)=\\epsilon_0 H(t)$, the total stress is $\\sigma(t)=E\\,\\epsilon_0 H(t)+\\eta\\,\\epsilon_0 \\delta(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function and $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta distribution; thus for $t0$ the stress is a constant $E\\,\\epsilon_0$, and the impulse at $t=0$ makes a conventional relaxation modulus ill-posed for a true step strain.**\nThis statement is a perfect summary of our derivation for the ideal step strain. The formula for $\\sigma(t)$ is correct. The stress for $t0$ is indeed constant at $E\\,\\epsilon_0$. The presence of the $\\delta(t)$ term means the relaxation modulus $G(t)=\\sigma(t)/\\epsilon_0$ is not a simple decaying function but contains a distribution, which is problematic for conventional definition and measurement. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Under a strain step $\\epsilon(t)=\\epsilon_0 H(t)$, the stress decays exponentially as $\\sigma(t)=E\\,\\epsilon_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau)$ with $\\tau=\\eta/E$, exhibiting classical stress relaxation.**\nThis is incorrect. As derived, for $t0$, the stress is constant at $E\\,\\epsilon_0$. Exponential decay is characteristic of the Maxwell model in a stress relaxation test, not the Kelvin-Voigt model. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Under a linear strain ramp $\\epsilon(t)=\\dot{\\epsilon}\\, t$ for $0tt_r$ followed by a hold for $t\\ge t_r$, the stress response is $\\sigma(t)=E\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t+\\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}$ for $0tt_r$ and $\\sigma(t)=E\\,\\epsilon_0$ for $t\\ge t_r$.**\nOur derivation yielded $\\sigma(t)=E\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t+\\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}$ for the ramp phase and $\\sigma(t)=E\\,\\epsilon_0$ for the hold phase. The description in this option is in exact agreement with our findings. The function describing stress for $t \\ge t_r$ is $\\sigma(t) = E \\epsilon_0$, so it holds at $t=t_r$ as well (being the value from the right, $\\sigma(t_r^+)$). **Correct**.\n\n**D. In the finite ramp test, there is a downward jump in stress at $t=t_r$ of magnitude $\\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}$ as $\\dot{\\epsilon}$ drops from $\\dot{\\epsilon}$ to $0$, which can be used to estimate $\\eta$.**\nOur analysis showed that the stress drop at $t=t_r$ is $\\Delta\\sigma = \\sigma(t_r^-) - \\sigma(t_r^+) = \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}$. This is a downward jump caused by the abrupt cessation of strain rate. Since the magnitude of the drop is directly proportional to $\\eta$ (with $\\dot{\\epsilon}$ being a known experimental parameter), measuring this drop allows for the calculation of $\\eta$. **Correct**.\n\n**E. In the hold segment of the finite ramp test ($t\\ge t_r$), the stress relaxes exponentially to zero; fitting this decay yields $\\eta$.**\nThis is incorrect. Our derivation for the hold segment ($t  t_r$) shows that the stress is constant, $\\sigma(t) = E\\,\\epsilon_0$. There is no relaxation or decay of any kind. The stress associated with the viscous element disappears instantly when the strain rate becomes zero. **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. From a single finite ramp test with known $\\epsilon_0$ and $\\dot{\\epsilon}$, the parameters can be extracted via $E=\\sigma(t_r^+)/\\epsilon_0$ and $\\eta=\\big(\\sigma(t_r^-)-\\sigma(t_r^+)\\big)/\\dot{\\epsilon}$, where $t_r^\\pm$ denote instants immediately before and after $t_r$.**\nFrom our analysis, the stress immediately after the ramp stops is $\\sigma(t_r^+) = E\\,\\epsilon_0$. Rearranging gives $E = \\sigma(t_r^+)/\\epsilon_0$, which matches the first formula.\nThe stress drop is $\\sigma(t_r^-) - \\sigma(t_r^+) = \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}$. Rearranging gives $\\eta = (\\sigma(t_r^-) - \\sigma(t_r^+))/\\dot{\\epsilon}$, which matches the second formula.

Therefore, I will proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. I will address each in sequence.\n\nFirst, we must formulate the linear measurement model. The problem states that the relaxation modulus $G(t)$ is approximated by a Prony series:\n$$\nG(t) \\;\\approx\\; \\sum_{k=1}^{K} G_{k}\\,\\exp(-t/\\tau_{k})\n$$\nWe are given a set of $M$ measurements of the modulus, $\\{G(t_{i})\\}$, at discrete times $\\{t_{i}\\}$ for $i=1, \\dots, M$. For each measurement point, we can write an instance of this approximation:\n$$\nG(t_{i}) \\;\\approx\\; G_{1}\\exp(-t_{i}/\\tau_{1}) + G_{2}\\exp(-t_{i}/\\tau_{2}) + \\dots + G_{K}\\exp(-t_{i}/\\tau_{K})\n$$\nThis represents a system of $M$ linear equations in the $K$ unknown weights $\\{G_{k}\\}$. We can express this system in matrix-vector form. Let $\\mathbf{g} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M}$ be the vector of measured data, where its $i$-th element is $g_{i} = G(t_{i})$. Let $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K}$ be the vector of unknown weights, where its $k$-th element is $x_{k} = G_{k}$. The system of equations can then be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{g} \\approx \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{A}$ is an $M \\times K$ matrix whose entries relate the unknown weights to the measurements. By comparing the matrix equation row by row with the summation for each $t_{i}$, we identify the entries of $\\mathbf{A}$ as:\n$$\nA_{ik} = \\exp(-t_{i}/\\tau_{k})\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the row index corresponding to the measurement time $t_{i}$, and $k$ is the column index corresponding to the relaxation time $\\tau_{k}$. This completes the first part.\n\nSecond, we are asked to formulate the linear least-squares problem with a nonnegativity constraint. The goal of a least-squares fit is to find the vector of weights $\\mathbf{x}$ that minimizes the discrepancy between the model prediction $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}$ and the measured data $\\mathbf{g}$. This discrepancy is quantified by the squared Euclidean norm of the residual vector, $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{g}$. The objective function to minimize is therefore $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{g}\\|_{2}^{2}$. Additionally, the problem specifies that the weights must be nonnegative, $G_{k} \\ge 0$, a constraint which stems from physical principles (thermodynamic admissibility). In vector notation, this is $\\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{0}$, where the inequality is understood element-wise. Combining the objective and the constraint gives the formal definition of the non-negative least-squares (NNLS) optimization problem:\n$$\n\\underset{\\mathbf{x}}{\\text{minimize}} \\quad \\|\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{g}\\|_{2}^{2} \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThis completes the second part.\n\nThird, we must solve this problem for a specific dataset.

From the first equation, we express $G_{2}$ in terms of $G_{1}$: $G_{2} = 4 - G_{1}$.\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4}G_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}(4 - G_{1}) = \\frac{5}{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4}G_{1} + 2 - \\frac{1}{2}G_{1} = \\frac{5}{4}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{4}G_{1} = \\frac{5}{4} - 2 = \\frac{5}{4} - \\frac{8}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}\n$$\nThis gives $G_{1} = 3$.\nConsequently, $G_{2} = 4 - G_{1} = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\nNow, we must verify if this solution, $(G_{1}, G_{2}) = (3, 1)$, satisfies the third equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{9}(3) + \\frac{1}{3}(1) = \\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe third equation is satisfied exactly. This means that the system $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{g}$ is consistent and has the unique exact solution $G_{1}=3$ and $G_{2}=1$.\nFor this solution, the residual norm is $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{g}\\|_{2}^{2} = 0$, which is the absolute minimum of the least-squares objective function.\nFinally, we check the nonnegativity constraint: $G_{1}=3  0$ and $G_{2}=1  0$. The constraints are satisfied.\nTherefore, the solution to the unconstrained least-squares problem is also the unique solution to the non-negative least-squares problem.

The limits of integration become $s=0$ for $t'=t$ and $s=\\infty$ for $t' \\to -\\infty$.\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_{\\infty}^{0} G(s) [i\\omega\\gamma_{0} \\exp(i\\omega(t-s))] (-ds) = \\gamma_{0} \\exp(i\\omega t) \\left[ i\\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} G(s) \\exp(-i\\omega s) ds \\right]\n$$\nThe stress response is also harmonic, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0} \\exp(i\\omega t)$, where $\\sigma_0$ is a complex amplitude. The complex modulus $G^{\\ast}(\\omega)$ is defined by $\\sigma(t) = G^{\\ast}(\\omega) \\gamma(t)$. Comparing with the expression above, we find\n$$\nG^{\\ast}(\\omega) = i\\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} G(t) \\exp(-i\\omega t) dt\n$$\nThis relation is valid for materials where $G(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$, which is true for the given model since $G_{\\infty} = 0$.\n\nNow we substitute the given expression for $G(t)$ into this formula:\n$$\nG^{\\ast}(\\omega) = i\\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left[ G_{1}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{1}) + G_{2}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{2}) \\right] \\exp(-i\\omega t) dt\n$$\nThe integral is linear, so we can consider each term separately. For a general term $G_{k}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{k})$, its contribution to the integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} G_{k}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{k}) \\exp(-i\\omega t) dt = G_{k} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{k}} + i\\omega\\right)t\\right) dt\n$$\nThis is a standard exponential integral, which evaluates to:\n$$\nG_{k} \\left[ \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{k}} + i\\omega\\right)t\\right)}{-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{k}} + i\\omega\\right)} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = G_{k} \\left( 0 - \\frac{1}{-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{k}} + i\\omega\\right)} \\right) = \\frac{G_{k}}{\\frac{1}{\\tau_{k}} + i\\omega} = \\frac{G_{k}\\tau_{k}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{k}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $G^{\\ast}(\\omega)$:\n$$\nG^{\\ast}(\\omega) = i\\omega \\left( \\frac{G_{1}\\tau_{1}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{1}} + \\frac{G_{2}\\tau_{2}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{2}} \\right) = G_{1} \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{1}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{1}} + G_{2} \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{2}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{2}}\n$$\nTo find the loss modulus $G''(\\omega)$, which is the imaginary part of $G^{\\ast}(\\omega) = G'(\\omega) + iG''(\\omega)$, we rationalize each term:\n$$\n\\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{k}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{k}} = \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{k}(1 - i\\omega\\tau_{k})}{(1 + i\\omega\\tau_{k})(1 - i\\omega\\tau_{k})} = \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{k} - (i\\omega\\tau_{k})^2}{1 - (i\\omega\\tau_{k})^2} = \\frac{(\\omega\\tau_{k})^2 + i\\omega\\tau_{k}}{1 + (\\omega\\tau_{k})^2}\n$$\nThe imaginary part of this expression is $\\frac{\\omega\\tau_{k}}{1 + (\\omega\\tau_{k})^2}$.\nThus, the loss modulus for the generalized Maxwell model is the sum of contributions from each mode:\n$$\nG''(\\omega) = G_{1} \\frac{\\omega\\tau_{1}}{1 + (\\omega\\tau_{1})^2} + G_{2} \\frac{\\omega\\tau_{2}}{1 + (\\omega\\tau_{2})^2}\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the loss modulus.\n\nNext, we argue from first principles that a passive material must have $G''(\\omega) \\ge 0$. The instantaneous power dissipated per unit volume is $\\dot{w}(t) = \\sigma(t) \\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. For a sinusoidal strain $\\gamma(t) = \\gamma_{0}\\sin(\\omega t)$, the strain rate is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\omega\\gamma_{0}\\cos(\\omega t)$. The corresponding stress is $\\sigma(t) = \\gamma_{0} (G'(\\omega)\\sin(\\omega t) + G''(\\omega)\\cos(\\omega t))$.\nThe energy dissipated per unit volume over one cycle of deformation (from $t=0$ to $t=T=2\\pi/\\omega$) is $\\Delta W_{d}$:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{d} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\sigma(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\gamma_{0}[G'(\\omega)\\sin(\\omega t) + G''(\\omega)\\cos(\\omega t)] \\cdot [\\omega\\gamma_{0}\\cos(\\omega t)] dt\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta W_{d} = \\omega\\gamma_{0}^{2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/\\omega} [G'(\\omega)\\sin(\\omega t)\\cos(\\omega t) + G''(\\omega)\\cos^{2}(\\omega t)] dt\n$$\nThe integral of the term with $G'(\\omega)$ is $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\omega t) dt = [-\\frac{1}{4\\omega}\\cos(2\\omega t)]_0^{2\\pi/\\omega} = 0$. This term represents recoverable stored elastic energy.\nThe integral of the term with $G''(\\omega)$ is $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\cos^{2}(\\omega t) dt = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\omega t)}{2} dt = [\\frac{t}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2\\omega t)}{4\\omega}]_0^{2\\pi/\\omega} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}$.\nSubstituting this result back, we find the dissipated energy per cycle:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{d} = \\omega\\gamma_{0}^{2} \\left[ G'(\\omega) \\cdot 0 + G''(\\omega) \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega} \\right] = \\pi \\gamma_{0}^{2} G''(\\omega)\n$$\nThe second law of thermodynamics requires that for any passive material, the net energy dissipated over a closed cycle must be non-negative, i.e., $\\Delta W_{d} \\ge 0$. Since $\\pi  0$ and $\\gamma_{0}^{2} \\ge 0$, this implies the physical constraint $G''(\\omega) \\ge 0$ for all frequencies $\\omega \\ge 0$. A model that violates this condition describes an active medium that can generate energy, which is unphysical for a simple polymeric solid.\n\nFinally, we find the smallest positive frequency $\\omega_{z}$ at which $G''(\\omega)$ changes sign. This occurs when $G''(\\omega_{z}) = 0$. For $\\omega_{z}  0$, we can set the expression for $G''(\\omega_{z})/\\omega_{z}$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{G_{1}\\tau_{1}}{1 + (\\omega_{z}\\tau_{1})^2} + \\frac{G_{2}\\tau_{2}}{1 + (\\omega_{z}\\tau_{2})^2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nG_{1}\\tau_{1}[1 + (\\omega_{z}\\tau_{2})^2] = -G_{2}\\tau_{2}[1 + (\\omega_{z}\\tau_{1})^2]\n$$\n$$\nG_{1}\\tau_{1} + G_{1}\\tau_{1}\\omega_{z}^{2}\\tau_{2}^{2} = -G_{2}\\tau_{2} - G_{2}\\tau_{2}\\omega_{z}^{2}\\tau_{1}^{2}\n$$\nWe group terms containing $\\omega_{z}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{z}^{2} (G_{1}\\tau_{1}\\tau_{2}^{2} + G_{2}\\tau_{2}\\tau_{1}^{2}) = -(G_{1}\\tau_{1} + G_{2}\\tau_{2})\n$$\nSolving for $\\omega_{z}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{z}^{2} = - \\frac{G_{1}\\tau_{1} + G_{2}\\tau_{2}}{G_{1}\\tau_{1}\\tau_{2}^{2} + G_{2}\\tau_{2}\\tau_{1}^{2}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given parameter values: $G_{1} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}$, $\\tau_{1} = 0.10$, $G_{2} = -0.60 \\times 10^{6}$, $\\tau_{2} = 10.0$.\nThe numerator of the fraction is:\n$$\nG_{1}\\tau_{1} + G_{2}\\tau_{2} = (1.0 \\times 10^{6})(0.10) + (-0.60 \\times 10^{6})(10.0) = 0.1 \\times 10^{6} - 6.0 \\times 10^{6} = -5.9 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}\n$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$\nG_{1}\\tau_{1}\\tau_{2}^{2} + G_{2}\\tau_{2}\\tau_{1}^{2} = (1.0 \\times 10^{6})(0.10)(10.0)^{2} + (-0.60 \\times 10^{6})(10.0)(0.10)^{2}\n$$\n$$\n= (1.0 \\times 10^{6})(10) + (-0.60 \\times 10^{6})(0.1) = 10 \\times 10^{6} - 0.06 \\times 10^{6} = 9.94 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s^{3}}\n$$\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $\\omega_{z}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{z}^{2} = - \\frac{-5.9 \\times 10^{6}}{9.94 \\times 10^{6}} = \\frac{5.9}{9.94} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-2}\n$$\nSince $\\omega_{z}^{2}$ is positive, a real solution for $\\omega_{z}$ exists.
