It is a standard derivation in the field of linear viscoelasticity and polymer physics. All necessary definitions and principles are provided and are correct. The problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins by utilizing the complex notation for linear systems. We consider a complex strain input $\\gamma_{c}(t) = \\gamma_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)$ and calculate the corresponding complex stress response $\\sigma_{c}(t)$. The physical strain $\\gamma(t)$ is the real part of $\\gamma_{c}(t)$, and due to the linearity of the Boltzmann superposition integral, the physical stress $\\sigma(t)$ will be the real part of $\\sigma_{c}(t)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the strain rate from the complex strain expression:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\gamma_{c}}{dt'}(t') = \\frac{d}{dt'}\\left(\\gamma_0 \\exp(i\\omega t')\\right) = i\\omega\\gamma_0 \\exp(i\\omega t')\n$$\nNext, we substitute this complex strain rate into the Boltzmann superposition principle to find the complex stress $\\sigma_{c}(t)$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{c}(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-t') \\left(i\\omega\\gamma_0 \\exp(i\\omega t')\\right) dt'\n$$\nTo evaluate this convolution integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $\\tau = t - t'$. This implies $t' = t - \\tau$ and $dt' = -d\\tau$. The limits of integration transform as follows: when $t' \\to t$, $\\tau \\to 0$; when $t' \\to -\\infty$, $\\tau \\to \\infty$. Note that the modulus $G(\\tau)$ is zero for $\\tau < 0$, so the lower limit of integration for $\\tau$ is $0$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{c}(t) = \\int_{\\infty}^{0} G(\\tau) \\left(i\\omega\\gamma_0 \\exp(i\\omega (t-\\tau))\\right) (-d\\tau)\n$$\nReversing the limits of integration removes the negative sign:\n$$\n\\sigma_{c}(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} G(\\tau) i\\omega\\gamma_0 \\exp(i\\omega t) \\exp(-i\\omega\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nWe can factor out terms that are not dependent on the integration variable $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{c}(t) = \\left[ i\\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} G(\\tau) \\exp(-i\\omega\\tau) d\\tau \\right] \\gamma_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)\n$$\nThe problem statement defines the complex modulus $G^*(\\omega)$ through the relation $\\sigma(t) = \\operatorname{Re}\\{G^*(\\omega) \\gamma_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)\\}$. For our complex calculation, this implies $\\sigma_{c}(t) = G^*(\\omega) \\gamma_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)$. By comparing this definition with our derived expression for $\\sigma_{c}(t)$, we can identify the complex modulus $G^*(\\omega)$ as:\n$$\nG^*(\\omega) = i\\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} G(\\tau) \\exp(-i\\omega\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nThis fundamental relation shows that the complex modulus is proportional to the one-sided Fourier transform of the stress relaxation modulus.

Let us work in the complex domain for convenience, where the angular displacement is $\\theta_c(t) = \\Theta e^{i\\omega t}$.\n\n1.  **Velocities and Shear Rate**:\n    At a radial position $r$, the tangential velocity of the upper plate (at $z=h$) is $V_p(r, t) = r\\,\\dot{\\theta}_c(t) = i\\omega r \\Theta e^{i\\omega t}$. The lower plate (at $z=0$) is stationary.\n    The total velocity difference $V_p(r, t)$ between the plates is accommodated by the shear flow in the bulk fluid and the slip at both walls.\n    $V_p(r, t) = v_{\\text{slip,top}}(r, t) + v_{\\text{bulk}}(r, t) + v_{\\text{slip,bottom}}(r, t)$.\n\n2.  **Uniform Shear and Slip**:\n    The assumption of uniform shear means the shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}_c(r, t)$ is constant across the gap $h$ at any given radial position $r$. The velocity drop across the bulk fluid is thus $v_{\\text{bulk}}(r, t) = h\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_c(r, t)$.\n    The Navier slip law states that the slip velocity at each wall is proportional to the shear rate at the wall. Since the shear rate is uniform, we have:\n    -   $v_{\\text{slip,top}}(r, t) = b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_c(r, t)$\n    -   $v_{\\text{slip,bottom}}(r, t) = b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_c(r, t)$\n    Substituting these into the kinematic equation yields:\n    $V_p(r, t) = b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_c(r, t) + h\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_c(r, t) + b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_c(r, t) = (h + 2b)\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_c(r, t)$.\n\n3.  **Strain, Stress, and Apparent Modulus**:\n    This equation connects the applied plate velocity to the true shear rate inside the material. We can integrate with respect to time to find the relation for strain $\\gamma_c(t) = \\dot{\\gamma}_c(t)/(i\\omega)$.\n    The plate displacement is $U_p(r,t) = r\\theta_c(t)$.\n    $r\\theta_c(t) = (h+2b)\\gamma_c(r,t)$.\n    From this, we find the true shear strain in the material: $\\gamma_c(r, t) = \\dfrac{r\\theta_c(t)}{h+2b}$.\n\n    The instrument, however, is programmed with the no-slip assumption ($b=0$). It calculates an *apparent* strain based on the gap $h$ alone:\n    $\\gamma_{\\text{app}, c}(r, t) = \\dfrac{r\\theta_c(t)}{h}$.\n\n    By comparing the true and apparent strains, we see:\n    $\\gamma_c(r, t) = \\left(\\dfrac{h}{h+2b}\\right) \\gamma_{\\text{app}, c}(r, t)$.\n    The true strain is smaller than the apparent strain by a real-valued factor.\n\n    The true shear stress $\\tau_c(r,t)$ is determined by the true strain and the true complex modulus $G^*$:\n    $\\tau_c(r, t) = G^*\\,\\gamma_c(r, t) = G^* \\left(\\dfrac{h}{h+2b}\\right) \\gamma_{\\text{app}, c}(r, t)$.\n\n    The instrument calculates the apparent modulus $G^*_{\\text{app}}$ by relating the measured stress (via torque) to the *apparent* strain it believes it is imposing. At any local position $r$:\n    $G^*_{\\text{app}} = \\dfrac{\\tau_c(r, t)}{\\gamma_{\\text{app}, c}(r, t)} = G^* \\left(\\dfrac{h}{h+2b}\\right)$.\n    This relationship holds for the entire measurement, as the factor $(h/(h+2b))$ is independent of $r$.\n\n4.  **Effect on Storage and Loss Moduli**:\n    Since $G^*_{\\text{app}} = G'_{\\text{app}} + iG''_{\\text{app}}$ and the factor $\\dfrac{h}{h+2b}$ is a purely real number (as $h$ and $b$ are real lengths), we can equate the real and imaginary parts:\n    $G'_{\\text{app}}(\\omega) = \\left(\\dfrac{h}{h+2b}\\right) G'(\\omega)$\n    $G''_{\\text{app}}(\\omega) = \\left(\\dfrac{h}{h+2b}\\right) G''(\\omega)$\n    Both moduli are reduced by the same factor. There is no additional phase shift introduced by this slip mechanism. Consequently, the apparent loss tangent is unaffected: $\\tan\\delta_{\\text{app}} = \\dfrac{G''_{\\text{app}}}{G'_{\\text{app}}} = \\dfrac{G''}{G'} = \\tan\\delta$.\n\n5.  **Slip Detection and Correction Protocol**:\n    The derived equation $G^*_{\\text{app}}(h) = G^* \\dfrac{h}{h+2b}$ shows a clear dependence of the apparent modulus on the gap height $h$.\n    -   **Detection**: To detect slip, one must perform measurements at a fixed frequency $\\omega$ and strain amplitude while varying the gap $h$. The theory predicts that $G^*_{\\text{app}}$ will be gap-dependent. Specifically, since the derivative $\\dfrac{d}{dh}\\left(\\dfrac{h}{h+2b}\\right) = \\dfrac{2b}{(h+2b)^2} > 0$ for $b>0$, the apparent modulus $|G^*_{\\text{app}}|$ will increase as $h$ increases. In the limit $h \\to \\infty$, $G^*_{\\text{app}} \\to G^*$, giving a gap-independent value, which is the true modulus.\n    -   **Correction**: For correction, one can fit the experimental data of $G^*_{\\text{app}}(h)$ vs. $h$ to the model $G^*_{\\text{app}} = G^* \\dfrac{h}{h+2b}$ using non-linear regression to find the two complex/real parameters $G^*(\\omega)$ and $b$.\n    Alternatively, for a linear fit, one can rearrange the equation:\n    $\\dfrac{1}{G^*_{\\text{app}}(h)} = \\dfrac{h+2b}{h} \\dfrac{1}{G^*} = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{2b}{h}\\right)\\dfrac{1}{G^*} = \\dfrac{1}{G^*} + \\dfrac{2b}{G^*} \\dfrac{1}{h}$.\n    A plot of $1/G^*_{\\text{app}}$ versus $1/h$ should yield a straight line. The intercept at $1/h = 0$ gives $1/G^*$, from which the true modulus $G^*$ can be recovered. The slope gives $2b/G^*$, allowing for the calculation of the slip length $b$.\n\n    For the case of exactly two measurement points ($h_1, G^*_{\\text{app},1}$ and $h_2, G^*_{\\text{app},2}$), we can solve the system of two equations:\n    $G^*_{\\text{app},1} = G^*\\,\\dfrac{h_1}{h_1+2b}$\n    $G^*_{\\text{app},2} = G^*\\,\\dfrac{h_2}{h_2+2b}$\n    Solving for $G^*$ from the first equation gives $G^* = G^*_{\\text{app},1}\\left(\\dfrac{h_1+2b}{h_1}\\right) = G^*_{\\text{app},1}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{2b}{h_1}\\right)$.\n    Substituting this into the second equation and solving for $b$ gives $b = \\dfrac{G^*_{\\mathrm{app},2} - G^*_{\\mathrm{app},1}}{2\\left(G^*_{\\mathrm{app},1}/h_1 - G^*_{\\mathrm{app},2}/h_2\\right)}$. These algebraic manipulations are straightforward and correct.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **Option A**: This option states that $G^*_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\omega,h) = G^*(\\omega)\\,\\dfrac{h}{h+2b}$, leading to identical scaling for $G'_{\\mathrm{app}}$ and $G''_{\\mathrm{app}}$ with no phase shift. It correctly describes the detection protocol by varying $h$ and observing an increase in $G^*_{\\mathrm{app}}$ with $h$. It proposes a valid correction scheme by fitting to the derived relationship. Finally, it provides the correct algebraic solution for the two-point measurement case. Every part of this option is consistent with our derivation.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **Option B**: This option claims that slip is an \"interfacial elastic effect\" that suppresses $G'_{\\mathrm{app}}$ more than $G''_{\\mathrm{app}}$. This is incorrect. The Navier slip model as given is purely dissipative ($v \\propto \\dot{\\gamma}$), not elastic. Our derivation shows that the scaling factor is real, meaning $G'$ and $G''$ are affected proportionally, and the loss tangent is unchanged. The proposed correction method of only adjusting $G'_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is therefore baseless.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **Option C**: This option states that $G^*_{\\mathrm{app}}$ increases as $h$ decreases, which is the opposite of our derived result. The functional form it proposes, $G^*_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\omega,h) = G^*(\\omega)\\left(1 + \\dfrac{2b}{h}\\right)$, is incorrect; this resembles the form for $1/G^*_{\\text{app}}$, not $G^*_{\\text{app}}$. It wrongly suggests extrapolating to $h \\to 0$, which would give a meaningless result $G^*_{\\text{app}} \\to 0$, not the true modulus.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **Option D**: This option incorrectly claims that the apparent moduli are independent of $h$ and instead depend on $R$. Our derivation shows a definitive dependence on $h$. The slip effect, as modeled, is governed by the ratio of slip length to gap height, $b/h$, not the plate radius $R$. While $R$ is part of the overall modulus calculation, it does not govern the slip artifact described. The proposed detection and correction method based on varying $R$ is therefore inappropriate for this model of slip.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2912764"}]}
