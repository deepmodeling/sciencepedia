Short-chain (stiff) limit, $L \\ll p$:\nIn this limit, the persistence length $p$ is much larger than the contour length $L$, so the polymer is very stiff. Bending is energetically costly. To form a closed loop, the chain must adopt a configuration that minimizes the bending energy $E = \\frac{\\kappa_{b}}{2}\\int_{0}^{L}\\kappa^{2}(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. For a fixed contour length $L$, the integral $\\int_{0}^{L}\\kappa^{2}(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s$ is minimized when the curvature $\\kappa(s)$ is constant along the contour. A planar circle is the unique shape with constant curvature that forms a closed loop. For a circle of radius $R$, the length is $L=2\\pi R$ and the curvature is constant, $\\kappa(s) = 1/R = 2\\pi/L$.\n\nThe minimum bending energy required to form a loop is therefore:\n$$\nE_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{\\kappa_{b}}{2}\\int_{0}^{L}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\frac{\\kappa_{b}}{2} \\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} \\int_{0}^{L}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\frac{\\kappa_{b}}{2} \\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} L = \\frac{2\\pi^{2}\\kappa_{b}}{L}\n$$\nThe probability of any configuration is proportional to its Boltzmann weight, $\\exp(-E / (k_{B}T))$. In the stiff limit, the probability of cyclization $J(L)$ is dominated by the probability of adopting the minimum-energy (circular) configuration. Thus, the leading term is the Boltzmann penalty for this energy.\n$$\nJ(L) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{min}}}{k_{B}T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi^{2}\\kappa_{b}}{L k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the given definition $\\kappa_{b} = k_{B}T p$, we obtain the dominant exponential dependence:\n$$\nJ(L) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi^{2}p}{L}\\right)\n$$\n\n2. Long-chain (flexible) limit, $L \\gg p$:\nIn this limit, the chain is modeled as a Gaussian chain. The problem specifies the Kuhn length $b=2p$ and the number of Kuhn segments $N=L/b = L/(2p)$. The cyclization probability density $J(L)$ is the joint probability density for both position and tangent vectors at the ends to coincide.\n$J(L)$ reflects two independent constraints in this limit:\n(i) Positional closure: The end-to-end vector $\\mathbf{R}$ must be zero. For a Gaussian chain, the probability density of the end-to-end vector is\n$$\nP(\\mathbf{R}) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2\\pi N b^{2}}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3R^{2}}{2Nb^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe probability density for the ends to meet ($\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{0}$) is $P(\\mathbf{0})$, which determines the scaling for positional closure.\n$$\nP(\\mathbf{0}) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2\\pi N b^{2}}\\right)^{3/2} = \\left(\\frac{3}{2\\pi (L/b) b^{2}}\\right)^{3/2} = \\left(\\frac{3}{2\\pi L b}\\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nSubstituting $b=2p$, the positional component of $J(L)$ scales as $(Lp)^{-3/2}$, or simply $L^{-3/2}$, as all constants are ignored for scaling.\n\n(ii) Orientational closure: The end tangents $\\mathbf{t}(0)$ and $\\mathbf{t}(L)$ must be parallel. For a WLC, the tangent-tangent correlation function is $\\langle \\mathbf{t}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{t}(L) \\rangle = \\exp(-L/p)$. In the long-chain limit $L \\gg p$, this correlation vanishes, meaning the end tangents are completely decorrelated. The evolution of the tangent vector $\\mathbf{t}(s)$ along the contour can be viewed as a random walk on the surface of a unit sphere. The probability density for a random walk in $d=2$ dimensions (the surface of the sphere is locally a $2$D plane) to return to the origin after a \"time\" $L$ scales as $L^{-1}$. Therefore, the probability density for the final tangent $\\mathbf{t}(L)$ to coincide with the initial tangent $\\mathbf{t}(0)$ scales as $L^{-1}$.\n\nCombining the scaling laws for these two independent events, the total scaling for $J(L)$ is the product:\n$$\nJ(L) \\propto (\\text{Positional Scaling}) \\times (\\text{Orientational Scaling}) \\propto L^{-3/2} \\cdot L^{-1} = L^{-5/2}\n$$\nThe algebraic decay exponent is therefore $m = 5/2$.\n\n3.

The function correctly reduces to $J(L) \\sim \\exp(-2\\pi^{2}p/L)$.\n- In the flexible limit ($L \\gg p$), the ratio $p/L$ is small, so the argument of the exponential approaches zero. Thus, $\\exp(-2\\pi^{2}p/L) \\rightarrow 1$. The function's behavior is then dominated by the algebraic prefactor, correctly reducing to $J(L) \\sim L^{-5/2}$.\nThe product of the two limiting forms is the simplest ansatz that bridges the two regimes.\n\n4. Maximization of $J(L)$:\nWe must find the value of $L$ that maximizes the function $f(L) = L^{-5/2}\\exp(-2\\pi^{2}p/L)$. The proportionality constant does not affect the location of the maximum. It is computationally simpler to maximize the natural logarithm of the function, as $\\ln(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\n$$\n\\ln(J(L)) = \\text{const} - \\frac{5}{2}\\ln L - \\frac{2\\pi^{2}p}{L}\n$$\nTo find the extremum, we differentiate with respect to $L$ and set the result to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}L}\\ln(J(L)) = -\\frac{5}{2L} - 2\\pi^{2}p\\left(-\\frac{1}{L^{2}}\\right) = -\\frac{5}{2L} + \\frac{2\\pi^{2}p}{L^{2}}\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero for $L>0$:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\pi^{2}p}{L^{2}} = \\frac{5}{2L}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $2L^{2}$ yields:\n$$\n4\\pi^{2}p = 5L\n$$\nSolving for the dimensionless ratio $L/p$ that maximizes the cyclization probability density:\n$$\n\\frac{L}{p} = \\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{5}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression.\nTo confirm this is a maximum, the second derivative can be checked.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\\mathrm{d}L^{2}}\\ln(J(L)) = \\frac{5}{2L^{2}} - \\frac{4\\pi^{2}p}{L^{3}}\n$$\nAt the extremum $L = 4\\pi^2 p / 5$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{5}{2L^{2}} - \\frac{4\\pi^{2}p}{L^{3}} = \\frac{1}{L^{2}} \\left(\\frac{5}{2} - \\frac{4\\pi^{2}p}{L}\\right) = \\frac{1}{L^{2}} \\left(\\frac{5}{2} - \\frac{4\\pi^{2}p}{4\\pi^{2}p/5}\\right) = \\frac{1}{L^{2}} \\left(\\frac{5}{2} - 5\\right) = -\\frac{5}{2L^{2}} < 0\n$$\nThe negative second derivative confirms that this point is indeed a local maximum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{5}}$$", "id": "2935166"}, {"introduction": "In many real-world systems, the persistence length is not an intrinsic constant but is instead \"dressed\" by interactions with its environment.

Then, using counterion condensation in the Manning picture for double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) with charge spacing $b = 0.17$ nm along the backbone and $\\ell_{B} = 0.70$ nm in water at room temperature (so that the Manning parameter is $\\xi = \\ell_{B}/b > 1$), take $\\zeta_{\\text{eff}} = 1/\\ell_{B}$. For a monovalent $1{:}1$ electrolyte of ionic strength $I$ (in mol/L), use the well-tested relation for water at room temperature $\\kappa \\, \\text{(nm}^{-1}\\text{)} \\approx 3.29 \\, \\sqrt{I \\, \\text{(mol/L)}}$.\n\nCompute the change in the measured persistence length when the monovalent salt concentration is increased by a decade, from $I_{1} = 0.010$ mol/L to $I_{2} = 0.100$ mol/L, for dsDNA with bare persistence length $p_{0} = 50$ nm. Define the requested change as $\\Delta p \\equiv p(I_{2}) - p(I_{1})$. Round your numerical answer to three significant figures. Express the final answer in nanometers (nm).", "solution": "The problem asks for two things: first, to derive the leading-order dependence of the electrostatic persistence length, $p_e$, on the screening parameter $\\kappa$ and the effective line charge density $\\zeta_{\\text{eff}}$; second, to compute the change in the total persistence length, $\\Delta p$, for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) when the ionic strength of the surrounding monovalent salt solution is increased from $I_{1} = 0.010$ mol/L to $I_{2} = 0.100$ mol/L.\n\nThe analysis begins with the Worm-Like Chain (WLC) model. For a semi-flexible polymer, the bending energy is given by:\n$$E_{\\text{bend}} = \\frac{1}{2} K \\int_{0}^{L} C(s)^2 \\, ds$$\nwhere $K$ is the bending modulus, $C(s)$ is the local curvature at arc length $s$, and $L$ is the contour length of the polymer. The persistence length, $p$, is related to the bending modulus by $K = p k_{B}T$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe total persistence length $p$ is the sum of a bare (intrinsic) part $p_0$ and an electrostatic part $p_e$:\n$$p = p_0 + p_e$$\nThis corresponds to a total bending modulus $K = K_0 + K_e$, where $K_0 = p_0 k_B T$ and $K_e = p_e k_B T$. Our goal is to derive an expression for $K_e$ by calculating the curvature-dependent part of the electrostatic self-energy of the polymer.\n\nThe electrostatic energy of the charged polymer is given by the pairwise sum of interactions between all pairs of infinitesimal charge elements along its contour. Let $\\lambda_q = e \\zeta_{\\text{eff}}$ be the charge per unit length, where $e$ is the elementary charge. The interaction potential between two elementary charges separated by a distance $r$ is given by the Debye-Hückel potential, $V_{DH}(r) = k_B T \\ell_B \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa r)}{r}$. Thus, the total electrostatic energy is:\n$$E_{el} = \\frac{1}{2} \\iint ds_1 \\, ds_2 \\, \\frac{\\lambda_q^2}{e^2} V_{DH}(|\\mathbf{r}(s_1) - \\mathbf{r}(s_2)|) = \\frac{k_B T \\ell_B \\zeta_{\\text{eff}}^2}{2} \\int_0^L ds_1 \\int_0^L ds_2 \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa |\\mathbf{r}(s_1) - \\mathbf{r}(s_2)|)}{|\\mathbf{r}(s_1) - \\mathbf{r}(s_2)|}$$\nThis energy is divergent for a straight rod. We are interested in the *change* in energy due to bending. Consider a segment of the polymer that is uniformly bent with a small curvature $C = 1/R$, where $R$ is the radius of curvature. The distance between two points $\\mathbf{r}(s_1)$ and $\\mathbf{r}(s_2)$ on a curve is the chord length. For a straight line, this distance is simply the contour separation $|s_1 - s_2|$. For a circle of radius $R$, the chord length is $d(s) = 2R|\\sin(s/(2R))|$, where $s=|s_1 - s_2|$. For small curvature (large $R$), we expand this distance to second order in $C$:\n$$d(s) = s \\left(1 - \\frac{s^2}{24 R^2} + O(R^{-4})\\right) = s \\left(1 - \\frac{s^2 C^2}{24} + O(C^4)\\right)$$\nLet $v(r) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa r)}{r}$. The change in the interaction potential due to bending is $\\Delta v = v(d(s)) - v(s)$. For small $C$, we use a Taylor expansion:\n$$\\Delta v \\approx \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial r}\\bigg|_{r=s} (d(s) - s) = \\left(-\\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa s)}{s^2} - \\frac{\\kappa \\exp(-\\kappa s)}{s}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{s^3 C^2}{24}\\right) = \\frac{C^2}{24} \\exp(-\\kappa s) (s + \\kappa s^2)$$\nThe change in electrostatic energy per unit length, $\\Delta U_{el}$, is obtained by integrating this change along the chain. For a long chain ($L \\to \\infty$), we can replace the double integral with a single integral over the separation $s = s_2 - s_1$:\n$$\\Delta U_{el} = \\frac{k_B T \\ell_B \\zeta_{\\text{eff}}^2}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\Delta v(s) \\, ds = k_B T \\ell_B \\zeta_{\\text{eff}}^2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\Delta v(s) \\, ds$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta v(s)$:\n$$\\Delta U_{el} = k_B T \\ell_B \\zeta_{\\text{eff}}^2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{C^2}{24} \\exp(-\\kappa s) (s + \\kappa s^2) \\, ds$$\n$$\\Delta U_{el} = \\frac{k_B T \\ell_B \\zeta_{\\text{eff}}^2 C^2}{24} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (s + \\kappa s^2) \\exp(-\\kappa s) \\, ds$$\nThe integral can be computed using standard forms related to the Gamma function, $\\int_0^\\infty x^n \\exp(-ax) dx = n!/a^{n+1}$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} s \\exp(-\\kappa s) \\, ds = \\frac{1}{\\kappa^2}$$\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\kappa s^2 \\exp(-\\kappa s) \\, ds = \\kappa \\left(\\frac{2!}{\\kappa^3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{\\kappa^2}$$\nThe sum of the integrals is $\\frac{1}{\\kappa^2} + \\frac{2}{\\kappa^2} = \\frac{3}{\\kappa^2}$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta U_{el}$:\n$$\\Delta U_{el} = \\frac{k_B T \\ell_B \\zeta_{\\text{eff}}^2 C^2}{24} \\left(\\frac{3}{\\kappa^2}\\right) = \\frac{k_B T \\ell_B \\zeta_{\\text{eff}}^2 C^2}{8 \\kappa^2}$$\nThis is the excess energy per unit length due to curvature. We equate this to the electrostatic part of the WLC bending energy, $\\frac{1}{2} K_e C^2$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} K_e C^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (p_e k_B T) C^2 = \\frac{k_B T \\ell_B \\zeta_{\\text{eff}}^2 C^2}{8 \\kappa^2}$$\nThis yields the electrostatic persistence length, which is the result of Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman (OSF) theory:\n$$p_e = \\frac{\\ell_B \\zeta_{\\text{eff}}^2}{4 \\kappa^2}$$\nThis expression shows the leading-order dependence: $p_e \\propto \\zeta_{\\text{eff}}^2$ and $p_e \\propto \\kappa^{-2}$.\n\nNow, we apply this result to dsDNA. The problem states that for dsDNA, due to counterion condensation (since the Manning parameter $\\xi = \\ell_B/b = 0.70 \\, \\text{nm} / 0.17 \\, \\text{nm} \\approx 4.12 > 1$), the effective line charge density is $\\zeta_{\\text{eff}} = 1/\\ell_B$. Substituting this into our formula for $p_e$:\n$$p_e = \\frac{\\ell_B}{4 \\kappa^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\ell_B}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4 \\ell_B \\kappa^2}$$\nThe total persistence length at a given ionic strength $I$ is $p(I) = p_0 + p_e(I) = p_0 + \\frac{1}{4 \\ell_B \\kappa(I)^2}$.\nWe are asked to compute the change $\\Delta p = p(I_2) - p(I_1)$:\n$$\\Delta p = \\left(p_0 + \\frac{1}{4 \\ell_B \\kappa(I_2)^2}\\right) - \\left(p_0 + \\frac{1}{4 \\ell_B \\kappa(I_1)^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4 \\ell_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\kappa_2^2} - \\frac{1}{\\kappa_1^2}\\right)$$\nWe are given the parameters: $p_0 = 50$ nm, $\\ell_B = 0.70$ nm, $I_1 = 0.010$ mol/L, $I_2 = 0.100$ mol/L. The inverse Debye length is given by $\\kappa(\\text{nm}^{-1}) = 3.29 \\sqrt{I(\\text{mol/L})}$.\nFirst, we calculate the values of $\\kappa^2$ for the two ionic strengths:\n$$\\kappa_1^2 = (3.29 \\sqrt{I_1})^2 = (3.29)^2 I_1 = 10.8241 \\times 0.010 = 0.108241 \\, \\text{nm}^{-2}$$\n$$\\kappa_2^2 = (3.29 \\sqrt{I_2})^2 = (3.29)^2 I_2 = 10.8241 \\times 0.100 = 1.08241 \\, \\text{nm}^{-2}$$\nNow, we substitute these values into the expression for $\\Delta p$:\n$$\\Delta p = \\frac{1}{4 \\times 0.70 \\, \\text{nm}} \\left(\\frac{1}{1.08241 \\, \\text{nm}^{-2}} - \\frac{1}{0.108241 \\, \\text{nm}^{-2}}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta p = \\frac{1}{2.8 \\, \\text{nm}} \\left(0.92386 \\, \\text{nm}^2 - 9.2386 \\, \\text{nm}^2\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta p = \\frac{1}{2.8 \\, \\text{nm}} \\left(-8.31474 \\, \\text{nm}^2\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta p = -2.96955 \\, \\text{nm}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\\Delta p \\approx -2.97 \\, \\text{nm}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the persistence length decreases as the salt concentration increases, which is physically expected as electrostatic repulsions are more strongly screened, making the polymer more flexible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-2.97}$$", "id": "2935177"}]}
