By comparing coefficients of powers of $x$, we find:\n$x^4: \\frac{9}{4} = a\\frac{35}{8} \\implies a = \\frac{18}{35}$.\n$x^2: -\\frac{6}{4} = -a\\frac{30}{8} + b\\frac{3}{2} \\implies -\\frac{3}{2} = -\\frac{18}{35}\\frac{15}{4} + \\frac{3}{2}b \\implies b=\\frac{2}{7}$.\n$x^0: \\frac{1}{4} = a\\frac{3}{8} - b\\frac{1}{2} + c \\implies \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{18}{35}\\frac{3}{8} - \\frac{2}{7}\\frac{1}{2} + c \\implies c=\\frac{1}{5}$.\nThus, the required decomposition is:\n$$\nP_2(\\mu)^2 = \\frac{18}{35}P_4(\\mu) + \\frac{2}{7}P_2(\\mu) + \\frac{1}{5}P_0(\\mu)\n$$\nWe substitute this into the integral for $N_4$:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} P_4(\\mu)P_2(\\mu)^2 \\mathrm{d}\\mu = \\int_{-1}^{1} P_4(\\mu)\\left(\\frac{18}{35}P_4(\\mu) + \\frac{2}{7}P_2(\\mu) + \\frac{1}{5}P_0(\\mu)\\right)\\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\nAgain, by orthogonality, only the $P_4(\\mu)^2$ term yields a non-zero integral:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} P_4(\\mu)P_2(\\mu)^2 \\mathrm{d}\\mu = \\frac{18}{35} \\int_{-1}^{1} P_4(\\mu)^2 \\mathrm{d}\\mu = \\frac{18}{35} \\frac{2}{2(4)+1} = \\frac{18}{35} \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{4}{35}\n$$\nThe numerator for $S_4$ is then:\n$$\nN_4 = \\frac{\\kappa^2}{4} \\left(\\frac{4}{35}\\right) + O(\\kappa^3) = \\frac{\\kappa^2}{35} + O(\\kappa^3)\n$$\nThe order parameter $S_4$ to leading order is:\n$$\nS_4 = \\frac{N_4}{Z} = \\frac{\\frac{\\kappa^2}{35} + O(\\kappa^3)}{1 + O(\\kappa^2)} = \\frac{\\kappa^2}{35} + O(\\kappa^3)\n$$\nWe have now established the leading-order dependence of both $S_2$ and $S_4$ on $\\kappa$:\n$$\nS_2 \\approx \\frac{\\kappa}{5} \\implies \\kappa \\approx 5S_2\n$$\n$$\nS_4 \\approx \\frac{\\kappa^2}{35}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that a fourth-rank order parameter $S_4$ is indeed generated, even though the interaction potential term $U_4$ is zero. To find the relationship between $S_4$ and $S_2$, we eliminate $\\kappa$. Substituting the expression for $\\kappa$ from the $S_2$ equation into the $S_4$ equation yields the leading nonlinear relation:\n$$\nS_4 \\approx \\frac{(5S_2)^2}{35} = \\frac{25S_2^2}{35} = \\frac{5}{7}S_2^2\n$$\nThis is the lowest nonvanishing order relation between $S_4$ and $S_2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{S_4 = \\frac{5}{7}S_2^2}\n$$", "id": "2920219"}]}
