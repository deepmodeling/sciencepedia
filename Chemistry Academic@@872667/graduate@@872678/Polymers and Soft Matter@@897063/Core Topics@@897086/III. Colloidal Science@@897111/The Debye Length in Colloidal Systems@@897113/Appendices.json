It provides a standard exercise in the application of Debye-Hückel theory to colloidal systems. All necessary physical constants, conditions, and governing equations are provided. We may proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the Debye screening length, $\\lambda_D$, for a symmetric monovalent electrolyte. The starting point is the Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential $\\psi$:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\psi = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of the medium and $\\rho$ is the net charge density. For a symmetric monovalent electrolyte (valency $z=1$), the charge density is given by the contributions from cations and anions:\n$$ \\rho = e(n_+ - n_-) $$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge, and $n_+$ and $n_-$ are the number densities of cations and anions, respectively.\n\nThese densities are given by the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the local ion concentration to the local electrostatic potential:\n$$ n_{\\pm} = n_b \\exp\\left(\\mp\\frac{e\\psi}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right) $$\nwhere $n_b$ is the bulk number density of each ionic species, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

The interaction energy is suppressed by a factor of $\\exp(-104)$, which is an exceedingly small number. The interaction is thus completely negligible.\n\nFor $C_2=100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $\\lambda_D \\approx 0.96\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The ratio $h/\\lambda_D$ is approximately $1000\\,\\mathrm{nm} / 0.96\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\approx 1040$. The suppression factor is $\\exp(-1040)$, which is even smaller. The interaction is even more negligible.\n\nIn both cases, at a separation of $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, the electrostatic repulsion is vanishingly small. At the higher salt concentration ($100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$), the screening is more effective, $\\lambda_D$ is smaller, and the interaction decays over a much shorter range, making it significantly weaker at the same large separation $h$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options.\n\nA. $\\lambda_D \\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ at $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ and $\\lambda_D \\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ at $100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$; at $h = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ the electrostatic double-layer interaction is exponentially small in both cases, becoming even more negligible at higher salt.\nThis option provides Debye length estimates consistent with our calculations ($9.61\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $0.961\\,\\mathrm{nm}$). The reasoning about the interaction at $h=1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is also correct: the interaction is exponentially small in both cases because $h \\gg \\lambda_D$, and it is even more negligible at higher salt concentration due to the smaller $\\lambda_D$. **Correct**.\n\nB. $\\lambda_D \\approx 30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ at $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ and $\\lambda_D \\approx 3\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ at $100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$; at $h = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ the electrostatic repulsion remains substantial at $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ but becomes negligible at $100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\nThe calculated Debye lengths are incorrect by a factor of approximately $3$. The claim that repulsion is \"substantial\" at $h=1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ for $C=1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ is false; even with their incorrect $\\lambda_D = 30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, the decay factor would be $\\exp(-1000/30) \\approx \\exp(-33)$, which is extremely small. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. $\\lambda_D$ increases linearly with ionic strength, giving $\\lambda_D \\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ at $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ and $\\lambda_D \\approx 100\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ at $100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$; thus electrostatic repulsion is stronger at higher salt and can persist over micrometers.\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. $\\lambda_D$ scales as $1/\\sqrt{I}$, so it *decreases* with increasing ionic strength. The numerical values are inconsistent and incorrectly assigned. The conclusion that repulsion is stronger at higher salt is the opposite of the known physical principle of electrostatic screening. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $\\lambda_D \\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ at $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ and $\\lambda_D \\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ at $100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$; at $h = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ double-layer forces are still comparable to van der Waals forces and can dominate stability in both cases.\nThe Debye length estimates are correct. However, the reasoning about the forces is flawed. The electrostatic force decays exponentially, $F_{elec} \\propto \\exp(-h/\\lambda_D)$. Van der Waals forces decay as a power law, e.g., $F_{vdW} \\propto h^{-n}$. At large separations where $h \\gg \\lambda_D$, the exponential decay is vastly more rapid than any power-law decay. The electrostatic force will be many orders of magnitude weaker than the van der Waals force and cannot be considered \"comparable\", let alone dominant. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation and analysis, only option A is fully consistent with the principles of physical chemistry and the results of the calculation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2931445"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basic calculation, this problem explores a crucial nuance: the effect of ion valency.

The Coulomb energy between two counterions of charge $ze$ at this separation is $U(a) = (ze)^2/(4\\pi\\varepsilon a) = z^2e^2/(4\\pi\\varepsilon a)$.\n\nTo form a dimensionless parameter, we take the ratio of this interaction energy to the thermal energy, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{U(a)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = \\frac{z^2e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon a k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} $$\nUsing the definition of the Bjerrum length, $l_{B} \\equiv e^{2}/(4\\pi\\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$, and the estimate for the interionic spacing, $a \\sim n^{-1/3}$, we can rewrite this parameter as:\n$$ \\Gamma \\sim \\frac{z^2 l_B}{a} \\sim z^2 l_B n^{1/3} $$\nThis dimensionless quantity $\\Gamma$ is known as the electrostatic coupling parameter.\n-   When $\\Gamma \\ll 1$ (weak coupling), the thermal energy dominates over electrostatic interactions. The ions are weakly correlated, and their discrete nature is not important. Mean-field theories are applicable, and the concept of a single Debye screening length, $\\lambda_D = ( \\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}}T / (e^2 \\sum_i n_i z_i^2) )^{1/2}$, is a valid description of electrostatic screening.\n-   When $\\Gamma \\gtrsim 1$ (strong coupling), electrostatic interactions are comparable to or greater than the thermal energy. The positions of ions become strongly correlated; they can no longer be treated as a continuous, ideal gas-like fluid. The mean-field approximation breaks down. Consequently, the standard Debye length loses its predictive power, and new physical phenomena emerge, driven by these strong correlations.\n\nWith this framework, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In mean-field linear screening, the Debye length remains a valid predictor even when $z^2 l_B n^{1/3} \\gg 1$ because screening depends only on the continuum permittivity and not on discrete ionic correlations.**\nThe condition $z^2 l_B n^{1/3} \\gg 1$ is precisely the strong coupling condition, $\\Gamma \\gg 1$. In this regime, ion-ion correlations are by definition strong and cannot be neglected. Mean-field theory, which fundamentally ignores these correlations, is therefore invalid. The premise that mean-field theory works because it ignores correlations is a circular and incorrect argument. It is the very neglect of these correlations that causes the theory to fail when they become significant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. A physically motivated strong-coupling parameter can be constructed by comparing a typical ion–ion Coulomb energy at separation $a \\sim n^{-1/3}$ to $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$, giving a dimensionless measure $\\Gamma \\sim z^2 l_B n^{1/3}$; when $\\Gamma \\gtrsim 1$, ion–ion correlations invalidate mean-field assumptions and make a single Debye length ill-defined.**\nThis statement correctly outlines the physical reasoning for the breakdown of mean-field theory. It correctly identifies the coupling parameter $\\Gamma$ as the ratio of the characteristic Coulomb energy to the thermal energy, derives its correct functional form $\\Gamma \\sim z^2 l_B n^{1/3}$, and correctly states that when $\\Gamma \\gtrsim 1$, the underlying assumptions of mean-field theory are violated due to strong ion-ion correlations. This invalidates the universal applicability of a single Debye length.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Near a highly charged surface, multivalent counterions can form a laterally correlated layer whose fluctuations and bridging produce an effective attraction between like-charged colloids, a phenomenon that cannot be captured by mean-field theories that neglect correlations.**\nThis statement describes a key consequence of strong coupling. Mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann theory predicts purely repulsive interactions between like-charged surfaces at all separations. However, in the strong coupling regime (high surface charge, multivalent counterions), the counterions condensed near the charged surfaces can exhibit strong lateral correlations, forming a liquid-like or even quasi-2D Wigner crystal-like structure. The correlations between the counterion layers associated with two opposing, like-charged surfaces can give rise to an effective attraction. This is a classic example of a correlation-driven phenomenon that is fundamentally absent from any mean-field level description.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The only mechanism responsible for the breakdown of mean-field screening at high $z$ and $n$ is the dielectric decrement of water; if the permittivity were held constant, Debye screening would remain valid regardless of $z$.**\nThis statement is false. While dielectric decrement (the decrease in the dielectric constant of the solvent at high ion concentrations) is a real effect that contributes to deviations from ideal behavior, it is not the *only* or even the primary mechanism for the breakdown being discussed. The dominant mechanism, especially for multivalent ions ($z > 1$), is the onset of strong electrostatic correlations, as captured by the parameter $\\Gamma \\sim z^2 l_B n^{1/3}$. Even if the permittivity $\\varepsilon$ were assumed to be constant, this parameter can become large, leading to strong coupling and the failure of mean-field theory. The strong dependence on $z^2$ makes this effect particularly pronounced for multivalent ions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. For water at $T \\approx 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ with $l_B \\approx 0.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $z=3$, and $n=10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, the estimate $\\Gamma \\sim z^2 l_B n^{1/3}$ is of order unity, indicating the onset of strong coupling and the limitations of a unique Debye screening length.**\nThis statement requires a numerical calculation.\nFirst, convert the concentration $n=10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to units of ions per $\\mathrm{nm}^3$.\n$n = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 10 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$.\nUsing Avogadro's number $N_A \\approx 6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ and the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^3$:\n$$ n = 10^{-2}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\,\\text{ions}}{\\mathrm{mol}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{L}}{10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^3} = 6.022 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{ions/nm}^3 $$\nNext, calculate the mean interionic spacing scale, $n^{-1/3}$:\n$$ n^{1/3} = (6.022 \\times 10^{-3})^{1/3} \\, \\mathrm{nm}^{-1} \\approx 0.1819 \\, \\mathrm{nm}^{-1} $$\nNow, calculate the coupling parameter $\\Gamma$ using the given values $z=3$ and $l_B \\approx 0.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$ \\Gamma \\sim z^{2}l_{B}n^{1/3} \\approx (3)^2 \\times (0.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}) \\times (0.1819\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}) $$\n$$ \\Gamma \\approx 9 \\times 0.7 \\times 0.1819 = 6.3 \\times 0.1819 \\approx 1.146 $$\nThe calculated value $\\Gamma \\approx 1.15$ is indeed of order unity. This signifies that the system is at the verge of or already in the strong coupling regime. The conclusion that this indicates the onset of strong coupling and the associated limitations of the mean-field Debye screening concept is therefore correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCE}$$", "id": "2931405"}]}
