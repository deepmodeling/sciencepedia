Mastering this calculation is the first step toward interpreting any GPC experiment.", "problem": "A single-column gel permeation chromatography (GPC) experiment is performed at isothermal conditions in tetrahydrofuran. You are told only the following foundational facts about size-exclusion chromatography: in the ideal, purely entropic (non-adsorbing) regime, solutes are separated by their hydrodynamic size because they partition between the interstitial (void) volume outside the pores and the pore volume inside the packing. A completely excluded solute reports the interstitial (void) volume, while a completely included small solute reports the total mobile phase volume. A partially included solute spends some fraction of its migration within the pore volume, which can be characterized by a dimensionless distribution coefficient that represents the fraction of pore volume that is effectively accessible to that solute.\n\nIn a particular experiment, a very high molar mass standard (fully excluded) elutes at a measured volume $V_{0} = 18.50\\ \\mathrm{mL}$, and a small molecule standard (fully included) elutes at a measured volume $V_{t} = 42.00\\ \\mathrm{mL}$. An unknown polymer analyte elutes at $V_{e} = 36.70\\ \\mathrm{mL}$ under identical conditions.\n\nStarting from the physical picture above and the definitions of the void volume and total mobile phase volume, derive a relationship linking $V_{e}$, $V_{0}$, $V_{t}$, and the distribution coefficient $K_{d}$, then compute the value of $K_{d}$ for the analyte. Round your final numerical value to four significant figures. Express $K_{d}$ as a pure number (no units).\n\nFinally, based on the value you compute, briefly interpret the physical meaning in terms of the analyte’s access to the pore volume and its hydrodynamic size relative to the pore size distribution. Your interpretation will be assessed separately from the numerical answer; the graded numerical answer is only $K_{d}$.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard, well-posed exercise in the fundamental principles of size-exclusion chromatography, a sub-discipline of chemical engineering and polymer science. It is scientifically sound, contains all necessary information, and is free of ambiguity or contradiction. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a relationship for the distribution coefficient, $K_{d}$, based on a physical model of chromatographic separation. In ideal size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), or gel permeation chromatography (GPC), the separation is governed solely by the entropy associated with the confinement of polymer coils within a porous medium. There are no enthalpic interactions, such as adsorption, with the stationary phase.\n\nThe total volume of the chromatography column, $V_{c}$, is composed of the volume occupied by the solid packing material, $V_{s}$, and the total volume of the mobile phase. The total mobile phase volume is, in turn, composed of two parts: the interstitial volume, $V_{0}$, which is the volume of the mobile phase between the packing particles, and the internal pore volume, $V_{p}$, which is the volume of the mobile phase inside the porous particles.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, a very large molecule that is completely excluded from the pores will elute at a volume corresponding to the interstitial volume. Thus, the elution volume for a fully excluded species is defined as:\n$$V_{\\text{excluded}} = V_{0}$$\nThe problem provides this value as $V_{0} = 18.50\\ \\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nConversely, a very small molecule that can explore the entire volume of the mobile phase, both interstitial and all of the pore volume, will elute at a volume corresponding to the total mobile phase volume, $V_{t}$.\n$$V_{t} = V_{0} + V_{p}$$\nThe problem provides this total volume as $V_{t} = 42.00\\ \\mathrm{mL}$. From this relationship, we can express the total pore volume, $V_{p}$, in terms of the experimentally measurable quantities $V_{t}$ and $V_{0}$:\n$$V_{p} = V_{t} - V_{0}$$\n\nNow, consider an analyte of intermediate size, such as the unknown polymer. This analyte can access the interstitial volume $V_{0}$ but can only access a fraction of the pore volume $V_{p}$ due to steric hindrance. This accessible fraction is defined as the distribution coefficient, $K_{d}$. The value of $K_{d}$ ranges from $0$ for a fully excluded molecule to $1$ for a fully included molecule. The volume of the pores accessible to this intermediate analyte is thus $K_{d} V_{p}$.\n\nThe total volume that the analyte experiences during its transit through the column is its elution volume, $V_{e}$. This volume is the sum of the interstitial volume (which it must traverse) and the accessible portion of the pore volume. This gives us the fundamental equation for elution in SEC:\n$$V_{e} = V_{0} + K_{d} V_{p}$$\n\nTo derive the relationship requested by the problem, we substitute the expression for $V_{p}$ into this equation:\n$$V_{e} = V_{0} + K_{d} (V_{t} - V_{0})$$\nThis is the required relationship linking $V_{e}$, $V_{0}$, $V_{t}$, and $K_{d}$. To compute the value of $K_{d}$ for the analyte, we must rearrange this equation algebraically to solve for $K_{d}$:\n$$V_{e} - V_{0} = K_{d} (V_{t} - V_{0})$$\n$$\\implies K_{d} = \\frac{V_{e} - V_{0}}{V_{t} - V_{0}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided experimental values:\n$V_{0} = 18.50\\ \\mathrm{mL}$\n$V_{t} = 42.00\\ \\mathrm{mL}$\n$V_{e} = 36.70\\ \\mathrm{mL}$\n\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{36.70 - 18.50}{42.00 - 18.50}$$\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{18.20}{23.50}$$\n$$K_{d} \\approx 0.774468085...$$\nThe problem specifies that the final answer must be rounded to four significant figures. The numerator, $18.20$, has four significant figures, and the denominator, $23.50$, also has four significant figures. Therefore, the result should be reported to four significant figures.\n$$K_{d} = 0.7745$$\n\nThe physical interpretation of this result is straightforward. A distribution coefficient of $K_{d} = 0.7745$ signifies that the unknown polymer analyte is able to access, on average, $77.45\\%$ of the total pore volume of the stationary phase. This value is closer to $1$ than to $0$, indicating that the hydrodynamic size of the analyte molecules is relatively small compared to the pore size distribution of the packing material. The molecules are significantly smaller than the largest pores, allowing them substantial access to the interior of the packing beads, but they are still large enough to be excluded from the narrowest pores, preventing them from accessing the full pore volume (for which $K_{d}$ would be $1$). The analyte is therefore correctly classified as partially included.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7745}$$", "id": "2916694"}, {"introduction": "While $K_d$ describes the partitioning of a single species, the true power of GPC lies in its ability to characterize the entire molar mass distribution of a polydisperse polymer.

This requires relating the fundamental definitions of the averages to the experimental data.\n\nLet us begin with the fundamental definitions for a polydisperse polymer sample comprised of discrete fractions, where the $i$-th fraction contains $N_i$ moles of macromolecules of molar mass $M_i$.\n\nThe total number of moles in the sample is $\\sum_i N_i$.\nThe mass of the $i$-th fraction is $m_i = N_i M_i$.\nThe total mass of the sample is $m_{total} = \\sum_i m_i = \\sum_i N_i M_i$.\nThe weight fraction of the $i$-th fraction is $w_i = \\dfrac{m_i}{m_{total}} = \\dfrac{N_i M_i}{\\sum_j N_j M_j}$.\n\nBased on these quantities, the number-average ($M_n$), weight-average ($M_w$), and z-average ($M_z$) molar masses are defined as follows:\n\n-   **Number-average molar mass ($M_n$):** The total mass of the polymer divided by the total number of moles.\n    $$ M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i}{\\sum_i N_i} $$\n-   **Weight-average molar mass ($M_w$):** The first moment of the molar mass distribution weighted by mass.

The chromatogram is a signal $S(V_e)$ as a function of elution volume $V_e$. The problem states that for a DRI detector, the signal is proportional to the mass concentration $c(V_e)$:\n$$ S(V_e) = K \\cdot c(V_e) $$\nwhere the constant $K$ is assumed to be independent of molar mass $M$.\n\nThe mass of polymer, $\\Delta m$, eluting in a small volume element $\\Delta V_e$ is $\\Delta m = c(V_e) \\Delta V_e$. From the detector response, this means:\n$$ \\Delta m \\propto S(V_e) \\Delta V_e $$\nFor a practical computation, the chromatogram is discretized into slices, indexed by $i$. For each slice, we have a signal intensity $S_i = S(V_i)$ and a volume width $\\Delta V_i$. The mass in this slice, $m_i$, is proportional to the area of the slice on the chromatogram:\n$$ m_i \\propto S_i \\Delta V_i $$\nThe total mass is proportional to the total area under the chromatogram, $\\sum_j S_j \\Delta V_j$.

This is a reversal of the correct formulas for $M_n$ and $M_w$. The definition for $M_z$ is also incorrect, as is the definition of $\\mathrm{PDI} = M_z/M_n$. The computational procedure suggests using only the peak height at the apex, which is nonsensical for determining a distribution, and claims peak areas are not needed, which is a fundamental misunderstanding of chromatography.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option provides an incorrect definition for $M_n$ as $M_n = \\dfrac{\\sum_i N_i}{\\sum_i \\dfrac{N_i}{M_i}}$, which evaluates to the number-weighted harmonic mean, not the number-weighted arithmetic mean. The definition for $M_z$ is also missing a denominator. Critically, it posits that the DRI signal $S(V_e)$ is proportional to the *number concentration* of molecules ($N_i \\propto S(V_i)\\,\\Delta V_i$). This is fundamentally incorrect; a DRI detector is a mass-sensitive detector, so the signal is proportional to *mass concentration*.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option correctly references the definitions from option A, but its computational procedure is flawed. It suggests ignoring the $\\Delta V_i$ factor, stating $m_i \\propto S(V_i)$. This is incorrect; the mass in a slice is proportional to concentration multiplied by the volume of the slice, i.e., $S(V_i)\\Delta V_i$. More grievously, it proposes a confused application of the Universal Calibration principle. It suggests replacing $M_i$ with $[\\eta]_i M_i$ in the averaging sums, which is not how Universal Calibration works. Furthermore, it claims this can be done with only a single concentration detector, which is impossible as an ancillary detector (like a viscometer) is required to determine the intrinsic viscosity $[\\eta]_i$ for each slice.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, only option A presents a fully correct and self-consistent set of definitions and procedures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2916703"}, {"introduction": "The ideal model of GPC treats solutes as rigid, inert spheres, but many important macromolecules, such as polyelectrolytes, are flexible and interact strongly with their solvent environment.

There are no contradictions, missing critical data, or ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived based on these principles.\n\n### Derivation\nThe conformation of a flexible polyelectrolyte in solution is determined by the balance of intra-chain electrostatic repulsion and the entropic tendency to form a random coil. The magnitude and range of the electrostatic repulsion are modulated by the ionic environment. We must consider two primary phenomena: counterion condensation and electrostatic screening.\n\n**1. Counterion Condensation**\nAccording to Manning's theory, counterion condensation occurs when the dimensionless linear charge density parameter, $\\xi$, exceeds unity. This parameter is defined as the ratio of the Bjerrum length $l_B$ to the bare charge spacing $b$:\n$$ \\xi = \\frac{l_B}{b} $$\nGiven $l_B \\approx 0.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $b = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, we calculate:\n$$ \\xi = \\frac{0.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 2.8 $$\nSince $\\xi = 2.8  1$, the polymer is correctly described as \"strongly charged,\" and significant counterion condensation is expected. This condensation effectively neutralizes a fraction of the polymer's bare charge, reducing the electrostatic repulsion between monomers.\nA key aspect of this phenomenon is its dependence on the concentration of added salt, $c_s$. As $c_s$ increases, the chemical potential of free ions in the bulk solution increases. This shifts the equilibrium between condensed and free counterions, favoring the release of condensed counterions from the polymer chain into the bulk solution. This process is known as **decondensation**. Consequently, as $c_s$ increases, the net effective charge on the polyelectrolyte chain increases. This effect, in isolation, would lead to stronger intra-chain repulsion and thus an *increase* in the coil size, $R_h$.\n\n**2. Electrostatic Screening**\nThe addition of salt (NaCl) also introduces mobile ions that form an ionic atmosphere around the charged polymer chain. This atmosphere screens the electrostatic potential of the charges. The characteristic length scale of this screening is the Debye length, $\\kappa^{-1}$, which for a 1:1 electrolyte is given by:\n$$ \\kappa^{-1} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c_s}} $$\nAs the salt concentration $c_s$ increases, the Debye length $\\kappa^{-1}$ decreases significantly. This means that the electrostatic repulsion between charges on the polymer chain is progressively weakened because it is effective only over shorter distances. The range of the repulsive interactions collapses.\n\n**3. Net Effect on Hydrodynamic Radius ($R_h$)**\nWe have two competing effects as $c_s$ increases:\n- **Decondensation**: Increases the effective charge on the chain, tending to cause coil expansion (increase $R_h$).\n- **Screening**: Decreases the range of electrostatic repulsion, tending to cause coil collapse (decrease $R_h$).\n\nFor flexible polyelectrolytes over the wide salt concentration range given ($1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $0.5\\,\\mathrm{M}$), the effect of electrostatic screening is dominant. The decrease in the Debye length is substantial (from $\\approx 9.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ at $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $\\approx 0.43\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ at $0.5\\,\\mathrm{M}$). This drastic reduction in the interaction range allows the chain to overcome the electrostatic stiffness and adopt a much more compact, random-coil-like conformation to maximize its conformational entropy. The increase in effective charge due to decondensation is a more subtle effect and is insufficient to counteract the powerful influence of screening.\nTherefore, the net result is that the polyelectrolyte chain progressively collapses as the salt concentration increases. The hydrodynamic radius, $R_h$, **decreases monotonically** as $c_s$ increases from $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $0.5\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n\n**4. Effect on Elution Volume ($V_e$)**\nThe problem stipulates the a priori relationships for the GPC process:\n- $V_e = V_0 + K_d V_i$\n- $K_d$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $R_h$.\n\nThis implies that a smaller molecule (smaller $R_h$) can access a larger fraction of the stationary phase pore volume, resulting in a larger partition coefficient $K_d$ and, consequently, a larger elution volume $V_e$.\nBased on our conclusion from step 3:\n- As $c_s$ increases, $R_h$ decreases.\n- As $R_h$ decreases, $K_d$ increases.\n- As $K_d$ increases, $V_e = V_0 + K_d V_i$ increases.\n\nThus, as the salt concentration in the mobile phase increases, the polyelectrolyte elutes at progressively larger volumes, corresponding to later elution times.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. As $c_s$ increases, $R_h$ decreases monotonically due to enhanced electrostatic screening despite partial decondensation; hence $K_d$ increases and $V_e$ shifts to larger volumes (later elution).**\nThis statement accurately reflects the derived physical behavior. It correctly identifies the monotonic decrease in $R_h$, attributes it to the dominant effect of electrostatic screening, and correctly acknowledges the opposing (but weaker) effect of decondensation. The subsequent conclusions that $K_d$ increases and $V_e$ increases are also correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. As $c_s$ increases, counterion condensation strengthens, increasing effective stiffness and $R_h$; therefore $K_d$ decreases and $V_e$ shifts to smaller volumes (earlier elution).**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The premise that \"counterion condensation strengthens\" with increasing $c_s$ is incorrect; the opposite (decondensation) occurs. Consequently, the entire chain of reasoning that follows is invalid.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. As $c_s$ increases, decondensation and screening cancel, leaving $R_h$ and $V_e$ essentially unchanged across the stated range.**\nThis statement posits a perfect cancellation of two effects that have different functional dependencies on salt concentration. There is no physical basis for such a cancellation, and it contradicts overwhelming experimental evidence that shows a strong dependence of polyelectrolyte conformation on salt concentration.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The dependence is nonmonotonic: at low $c_s$, condensation shrinks the coil so $V_e$ increases; at intermediate $c_s$, decondensation dominates and the coil swells so $V_e$ decreases again, yielding a maximum in $V_e$ versus $c_s$.**\nThis option presents a complex, non-monotonic behavior. While such behaviors can exist under very specific conditions (e.g., different types of ions, semiflexible chains), the standard \"first principles\" behavior for a flexible polyelectrolyte in a simple 1:1 salt solution is a monotonic collapse. The claim that \"decondensation dominates\" at intermediate concentrations to cause swelling is generally not true; the screening effect remains dominant.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2916753"}]}
