It treats gelation as a critical phenomenon on an abstract random graph, where the gel point corresponds to the emergence of an infinite connected component. This exercise [@problem_id:2916994] guides you through a foundational calculation within this framework, asking you to derive the critical extent of reaction for a system containing both network-forming (trifunctional) and chain-extending (difunctional) monomers, a common scenario in materials synthesis.", "problem": "Consider an ideal step-growth network-forming polycondensation in which a large ensemble of monomers each carries an integer number of identical, homofunctional reactive groups that react pairwise with one another. The system is a binary mixture of monomers of functionality $f=3$ (trifunctional) and $f=2$ (difunctional). Let $x$ denote the initial mole fraction (number fraction) of trifunctional monomers, so that the fraction of difunctional monomers is $1 - x$. Assume the following ideal conditions: (i) all functional groups are equally reactive at all times, (ii) intramolecular cyclization is negligible in the pre-gel regime so that clusters are locally tree-like, and (iii) the reaction proceeds randomly among all unreacted functional groups. Let $p$ be the extent of reaction, defined as the fraction of all functional groups that have reacted.\n\nUsing first principles of branching processes and percolation theory applied to this ideal random network, derive the gelation criterion in terms of the mean number of new reacted bonds generated when a reacted bond is followed into a new monomer. Then, for the binary mixture specified above, compute the critical extent of reaction $p_c$ at which the gel first appears as an explicit function of $x$. Express your final result as a single simplified analytic expression in terms of $x$. No rounding is required, and no units are to be reported for the final answer.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the gelation criterion for an ideal step-growth polymerization of a binary mixture of monomers with functionality $f=3$ and $f=2$. The final goal is to express the critical extent of reaction for gelation, $p_c$, as a function of the initial mole fraction, $x$, of the trifunctional monomers.\n\nThe problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It represents a standard problem in the statistical mechanics of polymers based on the Flory-Stockmayer theory of gelation, which is a mean-field application of percolation theory to a chemical reaction network. The given assumptions—equal reactivity of functional groups, absence of intramolecular cyclization, and random reaction—are the standard ideal conditions for this model. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe onset of gelation corresponds to the formation of an infinite, space-spanning polymer network. In the language of branching processes, this is the point at which the probability of a branching cascade continuing indefinitely becomes non-zero. The criterion for this transition is that the branching parameter, $\\alpha$, must be equal to or greater than $1$. The branching parameter $\\alpha$ is defined as the average number of new reacted bonds one encounters by following a randomly chosen reacted bond to the next monomer and then branching out from that monomer. Gelation occurs at the critical point where $\\alpha = 1$.\n\nLet us formulate $\\alpha$ for the given system. We have a binary mixture of monomers:\n1.  Trifunctional monomers with functionality $f_1=3$ and mole fraction $x$.\n2.  Difunctional monomers with functionality $f_2=2$ and mole fraction $1-x$.\n\nThe extent of reaction, $p$, is the probability that any randomly chosen functional group has reacted.\n\nTo calculate $\\alpha$, we perform a two-step statistical average. First, we must determine the probability of arriving at a monomer of a certain functionality by following a randomly chosen chemical bond. This probability is not the mole fraction of the monomer, but rather the fraction of all functional groups that belong to that type of monomer.\n\nThe total number of functional groups in the system is proportional to the number-average functionality, $\\langle f \\rangle$.\n$$ \\langle f \\rangle = \\sum_{i} x_i f_i = x \\cdot 3 + (1-x) \\cdot 2 = 3x + 2 - 2x = x + 2 $$\nThe fraction of functional groups belonging to trifunctional monomers is:\n$$ P(f=3)_{\\text{group}} = \\frac{x \\cdot f_1}{\\langle f \\rangle} = \\frac{3x}{x+2} $$\nThe fraction of functional groups belonging to difunctional monomers is:\n$$ P(f=2)_{\\text{group}} = \\frac{(1-x) \\cdot f_2}{\\langle f \\rangle} = \\frac{2(1-x)}{x+2} $$\nNote that $P(f=3)_{\\text{group}} + P(f=2)_{\\text{group}} = \\frac{3x + 2 - 2x}{x+2} = \\frac{x+2}{x+2} = 1$, as required.\n\nNow, consider a randomly chosen reacted bond and follow it to a monomer unit. The probability that this monomer is trifunctional is $P(f=3)_{\\text{group}}$, and the probability that it is difunctional is $P(f=2)_{\\text{group}}$. Once we arrive at this monomer, one of its functional groups is occupied by the bond we followed. A monomer of functionality $f$ has $f-1$ other \"outgoing\" functional groups available for forming further branches.\n- For a trifunctional monomer ($f=3$), there are $3-1 = 2$ outgoing groups.\n- For a difunctional monomer ($f=2$), there is $2-1 = 1$ outgoing group.\n\nThe average number of outgoing functional groups from a monomer reached by traversing a bond is the group-weighted average of $(f-1)$:\n$$ \\langle f-1 \\rangle_{\\text{group-weighted}} = \\sum_{i} P(f=f_i)_{\\text{group}} \\cdot (f_i - 1) $$\n$$ \\langle f-1 \\rangle_{\\text{group-weighted}} = \\left(\\frac{3x}{x+2}\\right)(3-1) + \\left(\\frac{2(1-x)}{x+2}\\right)(2-1) $$\n$$ \\langle f-1 \\rangle_{\\text{group-weighted}} = \\frac{3x \\cdot 2}{x+2} + \\frac{2(1-x) \\cdot 1}{x+2} $$\n$$ \\langle f-1 \\rangle_{\\text{group-weighted}} = \\frac{6x + 2 - 2x}{x+2} = \\frac{4x+2}{x+2} $$\nThis quantity represents the average number of potential pathways leading away from the monomer.\n\nThe branching parameter $\\alpha$ is the average number of these outgoing pathways that are actually connected to other monomers. Since the probability that any given functional group has reacted is $p$, the average number of new reacted bonds is the product of $p$ and the average number of outgoing groups.\n$$ \\alpha = p \\cdot \\langle f-1 \\rangle_{\\text{group-weighted}} = p \\left(\\frac{4x+2}{x+2}\\right) $$\nThe critical condition for gelation is $\\alpha = 1$. Let $p_c$ be the critical extent of reaction at the gel point.\n$$ 1 = p_c \\left(\\frac{4x+2}{x+2}\\right) $$\nSolving for $p_c$ yields the final expression for the gel point:\n$$ p_c = \\frac{x+2}{4x+2} $$\nThis is the desired result. It expresses the critical extent of reaction as a function of the initial composition of the monomer mixture. The expression correctly recovers the known limits: for a purely difunctional system ($x=0$), $p_c = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$, indicating that gelation (network formation) does not occur, although the weight-average molar mass diverges. For a purely trifunctional system ($x=1$), $p_c = \\frac{1+2}{4+2} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which is the classic Flory-Stockmayer result for $f=3$ monomers, $p_c = \\frac{1}{f-1}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{x+2}{4x+2}} $$", "id": "2916994"}, {"introduction": "While analytical theories provide the critical threshold for percolation, computational models allow us to directly visualize and analyze the complex geometry of the resulting clusters.

A connected component $C$ of $G$ is called spanning if it intersects both $T$ and $B$. If no such $C$ exists, define the spanning backbone length $\\ell$ to be $0$.\n\nOtherwise, among all spanning components, select $C^\\star$ by the following deterministic rule to avoid ambiguity: maximize $|V(C)|$; in case of ties, maximize $|E(C)|$; if ties remain, minimize the smallest vertex index under the indexing map $\\varphi: V \\to \\{0,\\dots,L^2-1\\}$ given by $\\varphi(i,j) = iL + j$.\n\nFor the selected $C^\\star$, define the induced subgraph $H^\\star$ with vertex set $V^\\star = V(C^\\star)$ and all open edges in $E_{\\mathrm{open}}$ whose endpoints both lie in $V^\\star$. Define the degree $d_{H^\\star}(v)$ of a vertex $v \\in V^\\star$ as the number of neighbors of $v$ in $H^\\star$. The leaf-stripping (also known as iterative pruning) procedure constructs the $2$-core of $H^\\star$ by repeatedly removing all vertices $v$ with $d_{H^\\star}(v)  2$ and their incident edges, updating degrees after each removal, until no such vertices remain. Let the resulting pruned subgraph be $K^\\star$. Define the spanning backbone length $\\ell$ as the number of undirected edges in $K^\\star$.\n\nYour task is to implement a program that, for each given parameter triple $(L,p,s)$, generates $G$, finds $C^\\star$ if it exists, computes the $2$-core $K^\\star$ by leaf-stripping, and outputs the integer $\\ell$ as defined above. If no spanning component exists, output the integer $0$ for that case.\n\nAlgorithmic constraints and foundations to be used and justified in your design:\n- Use only the definitions of graph connectivity, degree, induced subgraph, and the iterative pruning rule based on degree threshold $2$ to obtain the $2$-core, which removes all dangling trees that cannot lie on any simple path between $T$ and $B$.\n- To find connected components, you may use Breadth-First Search (BFS), which systematically explores vertices by non-decreasing distance in terms of number of edges.\n- The percolation is independent and identically distributed across edges as per the specified $p$, and the pseudo-random generator seeded by $s$ ensures reproducibility.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide outputs for the following parameter tuples $(L,p,s)$:\n- Case $1$: $(L,p,s) = (2, 1.0, 0)$.\n- Case $2$: $(L,p,s) = (3, 1.0, 0)$.\n- Case $3$: $(L,p,s) = (30, 0.4, 7)$.\n- Case $4$: $(L,p,s) = (50, 0.6, 12345)$.\n- Case $5$: $(L,p,s) = (50, 0.55, 999)$.\n\nAll outputs are integers. No physical units are involved. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $[r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4,r_5]$) in the same order as the cases above.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically and mathematically well-posed, grounded in the established principles of percolation theory, a branch of statistical mechanics and probability theory. The problem is self-contained, its definitions are precise, and the deterministic procedure for generating the random graph and for tie-breaking ensures that a unique, verifiable solution exists for each set of parameters. We will proceed to construct the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the size of the \"backbone\" of a spanning cluster in a bond percolation model on a finite $L \\times L$ square lattice. The backbone is formally defined as the $2$-core of the spanning cluster. The procedure is as follows:\n\nFirst, we construct the specific realization of the random graph $G = (V, E_{\\mathrm{open}})$ for a given system size $L$, bond occupation probability $p$, and pseudo-random seed $s$. The set of vertices $V$ corresponds to the sites of the square lattice, which we index for computational convenience by a single integer $v \\in \\{0, \\dots, L^2-1\\}$ via the mapping $\\varphi(i,j) = iL + j$ for a site at row $i$ and column $j$, where $i, j \\in \\{0, \\dots, L-1\\}$. The underlying grid graph $G_L$ has edges between adjacent vertices. Each edge is included in the set of open edges $E_{\\mathrm{open}}$ independently with probability $p$. To ensure reproducibility, a pseudo-random number generator is initialized with the seed $s$. We generate the adjacency list representation of $G$ by iterating through each potential edge of the grid, drawing one pseudo-random number for each, and adding the edge to the list if the number is less than $p$.\n\nSecond, we must identify all connected components of the graph $G$. This is a standard graph traversal problem, for which the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is a suitable and efficient method. We maintain a boolean array to track visited vertices. Iterating through all vertices, if an unvisited vertex is found, a new BFS is initiated from it to find all vertices belonging to its component.\n\nThird, for each component found, we determine if it is a \"spanning\" component. A component $C$ is defined as spanning if its vertex set $V(C)$ has a non-empty intersection with both the top boundary set $T = \\{v \\mid 0 \\le v  L\\}$ and the bottom boundary set $B = \\{v \\mid L(L-1) \\le v  L^2\\}$. If no such spanning component exists, the problem defines the backbone length $\\ell$ to be $0$, and the procedure for that case terminates.\n\nFourth, if one or more spanning components exist, we must select a unique component $C^\\star$ according to the specified deterministic rule. This rule is a lexicographical comparison based on a hierarchy of criteria:\n$1$. The component with the maximum number of vertices, $|V(C)|$.\n$2$. Among those tied for maximum $|V(C)|$, the one with the maximum number of edges, $|E(C)|$.\n$3$. If a tie persists, the component with the minimum value of its smallest vertex index is chosen.\nThis procedure guarantees a unique $C^\\star$.\n\nFifth, we compute the $2$-core of $C^\\star$, denoted $K^\\star$. The $2$-core of a graph is the largest induced subgraph with a minimum degree of at least $2$. It is found using an iterative pruning algorithm, also known as leaf-stripping. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n$1$. We first compute the degrees $d_{C^\\star}(v)$ for all vertices $v \\in V(C^\\star)$. The degree is the number of neighbors of $v$ that are also in $V(C^\\star)$.\n$2$. All vertices with degree $d_{C^\\star}(v)  2$ are identified and placed in a queue. These vertices, by definition, cannot be part of any cycle and are thus considered \"leaves\" of the structure.\n$3$. We iteratively process the queue. When a vertex $u$ is removed from the queue, it is pruned from the graph. For each neighbor $v$ of the pruned vertex $u$, its degree is decremented. If the degree of a neighbor $v$ drops to $1$, it has become a new leaf and is added to the queue.\n$4$. This process continues until the queue is empty. The set of vertices that have not been pruned constitutes the vertex set of the $2$-core, $V(K^\\star)$. Physically, this core represents the resilient part of the cluster, containing all cyclic paths, which are essential for robust transport.\n\nFinally, the desired spanning backbone length, $\\ell$, is the number of edges in the resulting $2$-core, $K^\\star$. This is computed by summing the degrees of the vertices within the core and dividing by two, $\\ell = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in V(K^\\star)} d_{K^\\star}(v)$, or by directly counting the edges whose endpoints both lie in $V(K^\\star)$.

The task is to derive the dynamics of the moments, which is a standard and solvable procedure.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem statement is formulated with precise mathematical language and is free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Moment Equations**\n\nThe time derivative of the $n$-th moment $M_n(t)$ is\n$$\n\\frac{d M_n}{d t} = \\sum_{k \\ge 1} k^n \\frac{d c_k}{d t} = \\sum_{k \\ge 1} k^n \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i+j=k} K_{ij} c_i c_j - c_k \\sum_{j \\ge 1} K_{kj} c_j \\right).\n$$\nBy re-indexing the summations, this can be shown to be equivalent to\n$$\n\\frac{d M_n}{d t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j \\ge 1} \\left( (i+j)^n - i^n - j^n \\right) K_{ij} c_i c_j.\n$$\nWe apply this general formula for $n=0, 1, 2$.\n\n-   For $n=0$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d M_0}{d t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j \\ge 1} \\left( (i+j)^0 - i^0 - j^0 \\right) K_{ij} c_i c_j = - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j \\ge 1} K_{ij} c_i c_j.\n    $$\n-   For $n=1$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d M_1}{d t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j \\ge 1} \\left( (i+j)^1 - i^1 - j^1 \\right) K_{ij} c_i c_j = 0.\n    $$\n    This demonstrates conservation of total mass, $M_1(t) = M_1(0)$, for any kernel, up to the gelation time.\n-   For $n=2$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d M_2}{d t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j \\ge 1} \\left( (i+j)^2 - i^2 - j^2 \\right) K_{ij} c_i c_j = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j \\ge 1} (2ij) K_{ij} c_i c_j = \\sum_{i,j \\ge 1} ij K_{ij} c_i c_j.\n    $$\n\nNow we analyze each kernel using these moment equations and the initial conditions $M_0(0)=M_1(0)=M_2(0)=c_0$.\n\n**Analysis of the Additive Kernel: $K_{ij} = i + j$**\n\n-   **Moment $M_0(t)$:**\n    $$\n    \\frac{d M_0}{d t} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j \\ge 1} (i+j) c_i c_j = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\sum_i i c_i\\right) \\left(\\sum_j c_j\\right) + \\left(\\sum_i c_i\\right) \\left(\\sum_j j c_j\\right) \\right]\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{d M_0}{d t} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ M_1(t) M_0(t) + M_0(t) M_1(t) \\right] = -M_1(t) M_0(t).\n    $$\n    Since $M_1(t) = M_1(0)$, we have $\\frac{d M_0}{d t} = -M_1(0) M_0(t)$. The solution is\n    $$\n    M_0(t) = M_0(0) \\exp(-M_1(0) t).\n    $$\n-   **Moment $M_1(t)$:**\n    As shown, $M_1(t) = M_1(0) = c_0$. The total mass is conserved.\n-   **Moment $M_2(t)$:**\n    $$\n    \\frac{d M_2}{d t} = \\sum_{i,j \\ge 1} ij(i+j) c_i c_j = \\left(\\sum_i i^2 c_i\\right) \\left(\\sum_j j c_j\\right) + \\left(\\sum_i i c_i\\right) \\left(\\sum_j j^2 c_j\\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{d M_2}{d t} = M_2(t) M_1(t) + M_1(t) M_2(t) = 2 M_1(t) M_2(t).\n    $$\n    Since $M_1(t) = M_1(0)$, we have $\\frac{d M_2}{d t} = 2 M_1(0) M_2(t)$. The solution is\n    $$\n    M_2(t) = M_2(0) \\exp(2 M_1(0) t).\n    $$\n-   **Gelation:** The second moment $M_2(t)$ grows exponentially but does not diverge at any finite time $t$. Therefore, gelation occurs only at $t \\to \\infty$. There is no finite-time gelation.\n\n**Analysis of the Multiplicative Kernel: $K_{ij} = i j$**\n\n-   **Moment $M_0(t)$:**\n    $$\n    \\frac{d M_0}{d t} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j \\ge 1} (ij) c_i c_j = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sum_i i c_i\\right) \\left(\\sum_j j c_j\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} [M_1(t)]^2.\n    $$\n    Since $M_1(t) = M_1(0)$, we have $\\frac{d M_0}{d t} = -\\frac{1}{2} [M_1(0)]^2$.

Integrating from $t=0$ yields\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{M_2(0)} - \\frac{1}{M_2(t)} = t \\implies M_2(t) = \\frac{M_2(0)}{1 - t M_2(0)}.\n    $$\n-   **Gelation:** $M_2(t)$ diverges when the denominator is zero, i.e., $1 - t M_2(0) = 0$. This gives a finite gelation time\n    $$\n    t_g = \\frac{1}{M_2(0)}.\n    $$\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. **For $K_{ij}=i+j$, the total mass $M_1(t)$ is conserved; $M_0(t)$ decays exponentially as $M_0(t)=M_0(0)\\,\\exp\\!\\big(-M_1(0)\\,t\\big)$; $M_2(t)$ grows exponentially as $M_2(t)=M_2(0)\\,\\exp\\!\\big(2\\,M_1(0)\\,t\\big)$; there is no finite-time gelation.**\nThis statement perfectly matches our derived results for the additive kernel.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. **For $K_{ij}=i+j$, $M_0(t)$ decreases linearly as $M_0(t)=M_0(0)-M_1(0)\\,t$, and $M_2(t)$ grows quadratically in time; gelation, if any, would only occur at infinite time.**\nThe description of the time evolution of $M_0(t)$ and $M_2(t)$ is incorrect.

The correct equation is $\\frac{d M_2}{d t} = [M_2(t)]^2$. The stated equation belongs to the additive kernel $K_{ij}=i+j$.

The gelation time fundamentally depends on the initial second moment, $M_2(0)$. The statement that it is independent of $M_2(0)$ is false.
