A perfect dendrimer is synthesized iteratively from a central core molecule. In each step, or \"generation\", a layer of branching units is added. This process is repeated until a dendrimer of the desired generation is formed, after which the outermost branches are capped with terminal units.\n\nConsider a specialized, perfect \"block-copolymer\" dendrimer of total generation $G$. It is built from a core of molecular weight $M_c$ and functionality (number of reactive sites) $N_c$. The synthesis proceeds in two stages using two different types of branch units.\n1.  For the inner generations, from generation $i=0$ to $i=G_1-1$ (where $G>G_1 \\ge 1$), branching units of type 1 with molecular weight $M_{b1}$ are used.\n2.  For the outer generations, from generation $i=G_1$ to $i=G-1$, branching units of type 2 with molecular weight $M_{b2}$ are used.\n\nAll branching units, regardless of type, have the same branching multiplicity $f_b$, meaning each unit attaches to one inner-layer site and provides $f_b$ new reactive sites for the next layer. Assume $f_b > 1$. After the final layer of type 2 branch units (at generation $G-1$) is attached, the structure is capped with terminal units, each having a molecular weight of $M_t$.\n\nDerive a closed-form analytical expression for the total molecular weight, $M_{total}$, of this perfect G-generation block-copolymer dendrimer.", "solution": "We denote the number of new branches added at generation $i$ by \n$$n_i = N_c\\,f_b^i\\,. $$ \nThese receive weight $M_{b1}$ for $0\\le i\\le G_1-1$ and $M_{b2}$ for $G_1\\le i\\le G-1$, and after generation $G-1$ there are $n_G=N_c\\,f_b^G$ terminal sites each capped by $M_t$.

The process begins with a core molecule having a reactive functionality of $f_c$. In a series of sequential growth steps, monomers of the type $AB_{f-1}$ are added to the periphery of the growing macromolecule. Upon attachment to the dendrimer, each monomer introduces $f$ new reactive sites for subsequent reactions. The generation of a dendrimer, denoted by $g$, corresponds to the number of successive layers of monomers added to the core, with the core itself being generation $g=0$.\n\nIn an ideal synthesis, all peripheral reactive groups of generation $g$ would react to form generation $g+1$. However, we will model a more realistic scenario where reactions are incomplete. The process of adding monomers to create generation $g+1$ from the active sites of generation $g$ is performed as a discrete step. During each such step, any given active site has a constant probability $p$ of successfully reacting with a monomer. A site that fails to react is assumed to become permanently inactive and cannot participate in any further growth steps.
