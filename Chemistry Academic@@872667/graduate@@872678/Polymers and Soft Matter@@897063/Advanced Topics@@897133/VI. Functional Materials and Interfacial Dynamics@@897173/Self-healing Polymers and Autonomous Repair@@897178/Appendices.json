The rate constant, $k$, for such a process is described by the Arrhenius equation:\n$$ k(T) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right) $$\nwhere $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the apparent activation energy, $R$ is the ideal gas constant ($R \\approx 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$), and $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem further states that the time to reach a fixed healing fraction, in this case $h=0.9$, is inversely proportional to this rate constant:\n$$ t_{0.9}(T) \\propto \\frac{1}{k(T)} $$\nThis is a common feature in processes described by first-order kinetics where the characteristic time $\\tau$ is equal to $1/k$. Let the proportionality constant be $c$. Then we have:\n$$ t_{0.9}(T) = \\frac{c}{k(T)} = \\frac{c}{A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)} $$\nWe can combine the constants $c$ and $A$ into a new temperature-independent prefactor, $A' = c/A$, as per the problem's stated assumptions. This leads to the following relationship:\n$$ t_{0.9}(T) = A' \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right) $$\nTo extract the activation energy $E_a$ from the experimental data, this equation must be linearized. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(t_{0.9}) = \\ln\\left(A' \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln(t_{0.9}) = \\ln(A') + \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln(t_{0.9}) = \\ln(A') + \\frac{E_a}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right) $$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = b + mx$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y = \\ln(t_{0.9})$.\n- The independent variable is $x = 1/T$.\n- The slope of the line is $m = E_a/R$.\n- The y-intercept is $b = \\ln(A')$.\n\nTherefore, by plotting $\\ln(t_{0.9})$ versus $1/T$, one should obtain a straight line whose slope allows for the determination of the apparent activation energy: $E_a = m \\cdot R$.\n\n**Calculation of Apparent Activation Energy**\n\nWe will transform the given data:\n- For $T_1 = 373\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $t_1 = 4.00\\times 10^2\\ \\mathrm{s}$:\n  $1/T_1 \\approx 0.002681\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}$, $\\ln(t_1) = \\ln(400) \\approx 5.991$\n- For $T_2 = 353\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $t_2 = 1.76\\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{s}$:\n  $1/T_2 \\approx 0.002833\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}$, $\\ln(t_2) = \\ln(1760) \\approx 7.473$\n- For $T_3 = 333\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $t_3 = 8.88\\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{s}$:\n  $1/T_3 \\approx 0.003003\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}$, $\\ln(t_3) = \\ln(8880) \\approx 9.092$\n- For $T_4 = 313\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $t_4 = 5.50\\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{s}$:\n  $1/T_4 \\approx 0.003195\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}$, $\\ln(t_4) = \\ln(55000) \\approx 10.915$\n\nOption A suggests calculating the slope using the endpoints.

An Arrhenius analysis requires a single, dominant rate-limiting step with a temperature-independent prefactor, far from any phase transition or change in dynamic regime (like the glass transition, which would induce non-Arrhenius WLF behavior).

The competition between these pathways is described by the law of mass action.\n\nThe rate of the intramolecular reaction, $R_{\\text{intra}}$, is proportional to the effective molarity, $\\text{EM}$, which represents the local concentration of the complementary reactive group on the same chain.\n$$R_{\\text{intra}} \\propto \\text{EM}$$\n\nThe rate of the intermolecular reaction, $R_{\\text{inter}}$, is proportional to the bulk concentration of all other available complementary reactive groups, which is given by the total reactive group concentration $c$.\n$$R_{\\text{inter}} \\propto c$$\n\nThe total rate of reaction for the specified reactive group is the sum of the rates of the two pathways, $R_{\\text{total}} = R_{\\text{intra}} + R_{\\text{inter}}$. The probability of a specific pathway occurring is the ratio of its rate to the total rate. Therefore, the probability that a newly formed bond is an intramolecular loop, $P_{\\text{loop}}$, is given by:\n$$P_{\\text{loop}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{intra}}}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{intra}}}{R_{\\text{intra}} + R_{\\text{inter}}}$$\nSubstituting the proportionalities, assuming the same intrinsic rate constant for both reactions, we get:\n$$P_{\\text{loop}} = \\frac{\\text{EM}}{\\text{EM} + c}$$\n\nStep 2: Determination of the elastically active strand number density, $\\nu_{s}$.\nAn elastically active strand is a polymer chain segment that connects two junctions in the network, contributing to its macroscopic elasticity. Only intermolecular bonds form such strands. Intramolecular loops are elastically inactive. Thus, the fraction of bonds that are elastically active is the fraction of intermolecular bonds, $P_{\\mathrm{inter}}$.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{inter}} = 1 - P_{\\text{loop}} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{EM}}{\\text{EM} + c} = \\frac{\\text{EM} + c - \\text{EM}}{\\text{EM} + c} = \\frac{c}{\\text{EM} + c}$$\nUsing the given values, $c = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$ and $\\text{EM} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{inter}} = \\frac{0.40}{0.05 + 0.40} = \\frac{0.40}{0.45} = \\frac{40}{45} = \\frac{8}{9}$$\nThe problem states that the total molar concentration of bonds formed, $C_{\\mathrm{bonds}}$, can be taken as $c/2$, since two reactive groups are consumed to form one bond.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{bonds}} = \\frac{c}{2} = \\frac{0.40\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}}{2} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$$\nThe molar concentration of elastically active strands, $C_{s}$, is the total molar concentration of bonds multiplied by the fraction of intermolecular bonds.\n$$C_{s} = C_{\\mathrm{bonds}} \\times P_{\\mathrm{inter}} = (0.20\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}) \\times \\frac{8}{9} = \\frac{1.6}{9}\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$$\nTo find the number density of elastically active strands, $\\nu_{s}$, in units of $\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, we must convert the molar concentration from $\\mathrm{mol/L}$ to $\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$ and then multiply by the Avogadro constant, $N_{A}$. The conversion factor is $1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}$, so $1\\,\\mathrm{mol/L} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$.\n$$\\nu_{s} = C_{s} \\times (1000\\,\\mathrm{L/m^3}) \\times N_{A}$$\n$$\\nu_{s} = \\left(\\frac{1.6}{9}\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}\\right) \\times (1000\\,\\mathrm{L/m^3}) \\times (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}})$$\n$$\\nu_{s} = \\frac{1600}{9} \\times 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}} \\approx 1.07060 \\times 10^{26}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$$\n\nStep 3: Computation of the shear modulus, $G$.\nThe shear modulus is given by the phantom-network model expression:\n$$G = \\nu_{s}\\,k_{B}T\\,(1 - \\frac{2}{f})$$\nWe are given the junction functionality $f=4$, the temperature $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and the Boltzmann constant $k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$. First, we calculate the correction factor:\n$$1 - \\frac{2}{f} = 1 - \\frac{2}{4} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$$\nNow we substitute all the values into the equation for $G$. It is convenient to use the relation $R = N_{A} k_{B}$, where $R$ is the ideal gas constant.\n$$G = (C_{s} \\times 1000 \\times N_{A}) \\times k_{B}T \\times (1 - \\frac{2}{f}) = (C_{s} \\times 1000) \\times R T \\times (1 - \\frac{2}{f})$$\nHere, $C_s \\times 1000$ represents the molar concentration of strands in $\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$.\n$$C_{s} \\times 1000 = \\frac{1600}{9}\\,\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$R = N_{A}k_{B} = (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\approx 8.31446\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}$$\n$$G = \\left(\\frac{1600}{9}\\,\\mathrm{mol/m^3}\\right) \\times (8.31446\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times 0.5$$\n$$G \\approx 177.778 \\times 8.31446 \\times 298 \\times 0.5 \\,\\mathrm{J/m^3}$$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{J/m^3}$ is equivalent to $\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$$G \\approx 220292.36\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilopascals ($\\mathrm{kPa}$).\n$$G \\approx 220.29236\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$G \\approx 220\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$$\nThis can be expressed as $2.20 \\times 10^2\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ to explicitly indicate three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.20 \\times 10^{2}}$$", "id": "2927599"}]}
