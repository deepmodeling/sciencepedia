The Helfrich model is the canonical framework for describing the curvature elasticity of lipid bilayers. The use of a Monge gauge, small-slope approximation, and Fourier-like modes for the height function are standard methods in this field. All terms are well-defined and the problem is objective.\nThe problem is self-contained and consistent. The given parameters are physically realistic for a lipid bilayer.

The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is well-posed.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe Helfrich free-energy functional for a membrane surface $S$ is given by:\n$$ F_H = \\int_S \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa}{2} (2H - C_0)^2 + \\bar{\\kappa} K \\right] dA $$\nwhere $H$ is the mean curvature, $K$ is the Gaussian curvature, $C_0$ is the spontaneous curvature, $\\kappa$ is the bending rigidity, $\\bar{\\kappa}$ is the Gaussian bending modulus, and $dA$ is the surface area element.\nThe problem specifies zero spontaneous curvature, $C_0=0$. The functional simplifies to:\n$$ F_H = \\int_S \\left( 2\\kappa H^2 + \\bar{\\kappa} K \\right) dA $$\nThe problem describes a doubly periodic system, which has the topology of a torus. For a closed surface without boundary, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature is a topological invariant:\n$$ \\int_S K \\, dA = 2\\pi \\chi $$\nwhere $\\chi$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface. For a torus, the genus is $g=1$, so the Euler characteristic is $\\chi = 2 - 2g = 2 - 2(1) = 0$. Consequently, the contribution from the Gaussian curvature term to the total energy is zero:\n$$ \\int_S \\bar{\\kappa} K \\, dA = \\bar{\\kappa} (0) = 0 $$\nThe total bending energy is therefore given solely by the mean curvature term:\n$$ F = \\int_S 2\\kappa H^2 \\, dA $$\nFor a surface described in the Monge gauge $z=h(x,y)$ under the small-slope approximation ($|\\nabla h| \\ll 1$), the mean curvature $H$ and the area element $dA$ can be expanded in terms of the derivatives of $h$. The general expressions are:\n$$ 2H = \\frac{(1+h_y^2)h_{xx} - 2h_x h_y h_{xy} + (1+h_x^2)h_{yy}}{(1+h_x^2+h_y^2)^{3/2}} \\quad , \\quad dA = \\sqrt{1+h_x^2+h_y^2} \\,dx\\,dy $$\nwhere subscripts denote partial derivatives (e.g., $h_x = \\partial h / \\partial x$).\nThe problem asks for an expression for the energy to quadratic order in slopes. This corresponds to the lowest non-trivial order in an expansion in powers of $h$ and its derivatives.\nTo this order, we approximate $2H \\approx \\nabla^2 h = h_{xx} + h_{yy}$ and $dA \\approx dx\\,dy$. This is justified because $h_x, h_y$ are first order small quantities, and $h_{xx}, h_{yy}, h_{xy}$ are also first order small (assuming $h$ is a smooth function like the given cosine).\nThen $H^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{4}(\\nabla^2 h)^2$, which is a second-order term. The area element is $dA \\approx (1 + \\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla h|^2)dx\\,dy$.\nThe energy integral becomes:\n$$ F = \\int_0^L \\int_0^L 2\\kappa \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla^2 h \\right)^2 (1 + \\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla h|^2) \\,dx\\,dy + \\dots $$\nThe term $\\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla h|^2 (\\nabla^2 h)^2$ is of fourth order and is neglected. Thus, to quadratic order, the energy is given by the well-known expression:\n$$ F \\approx \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\int_0^L \\int_0^L (\\nabla^2 h)^2 \\,dx\\,dy $$\nNow, we evaluate this integral for the given height function $h(x,y) = a \\cos(qx)\\cos(qy)$.\nFirst, we compute the Laplacian $\\nabla^2 h$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = -aq \\sin(qx) \\cos(qy) \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial x^2} = -aq^2 \\cos(qx) \\cos(qy) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} = -aq \\cos(qx) \\sin(qy) \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2} = -aq^2 \\cos(qx) \\cos(qy) $$\n$$ \\nabla^2 h = \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2} = -2aq^2 \\cos(qx) \\cos(qy) $$\nNext, we square the Laplacian:\n$$ (\\nabla^2 h)^2 = \\left( -2aq^2 \\cos(qx) \\cos(qy) \\right)^2 = 4a^2q^4 \\cos^2(qx) \\cos^2(qy) $$\nNow, we substitute this into the energy expression and integrate over the domain $[0,L] \\times [0,L]$:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\int_0^L \\int_0^L 4a^2q^4 \\cos^2(qx) \\cos^2(qy) \\,dx\\,dy $$\n$$ F = 2\\kappa a^2q^4 \\left( \\int_0^L \\cos^2(qx) \\,dx \\right) \\left( \\int_0^L \\cos^2(qy) \\,dy \\right) $$\nWe evaluate the integral $\\int_0^L \\cos^2(qx) \\,dx$. Using the trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$ and the given relation $q=2\\pi/L$:\n$$ \\int_0^L \\cos^2(qx) \\,dx = \\int_0^L \\frac{1 + \\cos(2qx)}{2} \\,dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ x + \\frac{\\sin(2qx)}{2q} \\right]_0^L $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left( L + \\frac{\\sin(2qL)}{2q} \\right) - \\left( 0 + \\frac{\\sin(0)}{2q} \\right) \\right] $$\nSince $qL = 2\\pi$, we have $\\sin(2qL) = \\sin(4\\pi) = 0$. The integral evaluates to:\n$$ \\int_0^L \\cos^2(qx) \\,dx = \\frac{L}{2} $$\nThe integral with respect to $y$ is identical. Therefore:\n$$ \\left( \\int_0^L \\cos^2(qx) \\,dx \\right) \\left( \\int_0^L \\cos^2(qy) \\,dy \\right) = \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = \\frac{L^2}{4} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the energy $F$:\n$$ F = 2\\kappa a^2q^4 \\left( \\frac{L^2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a^2 q^4 L^2 $$\nFinally, we substitute $q = 2\\pi/L$ to obtain the final analytical expression for the energy:\n$$ F = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a^2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^4 L^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a^2 \\frac{16\\pi^4}{L^4} L^2 = \\frac{8\\pi^4 \\kappa a^2}{L^2} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$L = 1\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$\n$a = 8\\,\\text{nm} = 8 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}$\n$\\kappa = 20\\,k_{B}T$\n$$ F = \\frac{8\\pi^4 (20\\,k_{B}T) (8 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m})^2}{(10^{-6}\\,\\text{m})^2} $$\nWe want the result in units of $k_B T$, so we compute the numerical factor:\n$$ \\frac{F}{k_B T} = \\frac{8\\pi^4 \\times 20 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-9})^2}{(10^{-6})^2} = \\frac{8\\pi^4 \\times 20 \\times 64 \\times 10^{-18}}{10^{-12}} $$\n$$ \\frac{F}{k_B T} = 8 \\times 20 \\times 64 \\times \\pi^4 \\times 10^{-6} = 10240 \\times \\pi^4 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.01024 \\pi^4 $$\nUsing the value $\\pi^4 \\approx 97.40909$:\n$$ \\frac{F}{k_B T} = 0.01024 \\times 97.40909 \\approx 0.9974609664 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.9975$.\nThe final result is $F = 0.9975\\,k_B T$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9975}$$", "id": "2917342"}, {"introduction": "Beyond describing static shapes, the principles of curvature elasticity allow us to understand and predict dynamic events and equilibrium structures.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe starting point is the Helfrich Hamiltonian for a tensionless membrane with zero spontaneous curvature ($C_0=0$). For a surface of fixed topology, the term related to the Gaussian curvature $K$ integrates to a constant due to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and can be disregarded. The Hamiltonian is thus given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{H} = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\int (2H)^2 \\, dA $$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the bending rigidity, $H$ is the mean curvature, and $dA$ is the surface area element.\n\nFor small, out-of-plane fluctuations, the membrane surface is described by a height field $h(\\mathbf{x})$ above a reference plane $\\mathbf{x}=(x,y)$, which is the Monge representation. In this gauge, the Hamiltonian must be expanded in powers of $h$. The part of the Hamiltonian quadratic in $h$ (the harmonic approximation) is:\n$$ \\mathcal{H}^{(2)} = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\int (\\nabla^2 h)^2 \\, d^2x $$\nIn Fourier space, where $h(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} h_{\\mathbf{q}} e^{i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}}$, this becomes:\n$$ \\mathcal{H}^{(2)} = \\frac{\\kappa A}{2} \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} q^4 |h_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2 $$\nwhere $q=|\\mathbf{q}|$ and $A$ is the projected area of the membrane patch. From the equipartition theorem, the thermal average of the fluctuation amplitudes is:\n$$ \\langle |h_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T}{\\kappa A q^4} $$\n\nTo renormalize $\\kappa$, we must consider the non-linear (anharmonic) terms in the Hamiltonian that arise from a more complete expansion of the mean curvature $H$ and the area element $dA$. These terms describe the interactions between fluctuation modes. The Wilsonian renormalization group procedure involves integrating out the short-wavelength (high-q) \"fast\" modes and observing their effect on the effective Hamiltonian for the long-wavelength (low-q) \"slow\" modes.\n\nWe partition the height field $h$ into slow modes $h_$ ($q  \\Lambda/b$) and fast modes $h_$ ($\\Lambda/b  q  \\Lambda$). The effective Hamiltonian for the slow modes, $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{eff}}(h_)$, is obtained by a path integral over the fast modes:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{eff}}(h_)}{k_B T}\\right) = \\int \\mathcal{D}h_ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mathcal{H}(h_+h_)}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nTo one-loop order, the correction to the Hamiltonian is the average of the interaction part, $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{int}} = \\mathcal{H} - \\mathcal{H}^{(2)}$, taken over the Gaussian distribution of the fast modes. We seek corrections to the effective Hamiltonian that have the same form as the original quadratic part, $\\sim (\\nabla^2 h_)^2$, as the coefficient of this term defines the renormalized bending rigidity.\n\nThe physical origin of the renormalization is that the fast fluctuations are constrained by the slowly varying curvature of the large-scale modes. This entropic effect effectively softens the membrane at larger length scales. The detailed calculation, which is standard in the literature, involves evaluating Feynman diagrams corresponding to the averaging of quartic interaction terms. This yields a negative correction to the bending rigidity. The result of this one-loop calculation is the renormalization group flow equation for $\\kappa$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\kappa}{d\\ln L} = - \\frac{3 k_B T}{4\\pi} $$\nwhere $L$ is the observation length scale, which is inversely related to the wavevector cutoff, $L \\sim 1/q$. The negative sign indicates that the effective rigidity decreases as the length scale increases.\n\nTo find the rigidity $\\kappa_R(L)$ at a macroscopic scale $L$ given a \"bare\" rigidity $\\kappa_0$ at a microscopic cutoff scale $a$, we must integrate this differential equation:\n$$ \\int_{\\kappa_0}^{\\kappa_R(L)} d\\kappa = -\\frac{3 k_B T}{4\\pi} \\int_{\\ln a}^{\\ln L} d(\\ln L') $$\n$$ \\kappa_R(L) - \\kappa_0 = -\\frac{3 k_B T}{4\\pi} (\\ln L - \\ln a) $$\nThis yields the desired expression for the scale-dependent bending rigidity:\n$$ \\kappa_R(L) = \\kappa_0 - \\frac{3 k_B T}{4\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{a}\\right) $$\nThis is the derived scale dependence required by the problem.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given parameters.\n- Bare rigidity: $\\kappa_0 = 25\\,k_B T$.\n- Microscopic cutoff: $a = 5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Infrared scale: $L = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Temperature: $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Boltzmann constant: $k_B = 1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio of the length scales:\n$$ \\frac{L}{a} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 2.0 \\times 10^3 = 2000 $$\nNext, we determine the value of the thermal energy $k_B T$:\n$$ k_B T = (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 4.141947 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\nThe bare rigidity in Joules is:\n$$ \\kappa_0 = 25 \\times (4.141947 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}) = 1.03548675 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\nNow, we compute the logarithmic correction term:\n$$ \\Delta\\kappa = \\frac{3 k_B T}{4\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{a}\\right) = \\frac{3 \\times (4.141947 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J})}{4\\pi} \\ln(2000) $$\nUsing $\\ln(2000) \\approx 7.60090246$, we have:\n$$ \\Delta\\kappa \\approx \\frac{3 \\times (4.141947 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J})}{4 \\times 3.14159265} \\times 7.60090246 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\kappa \\approx (9.8856 \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\times 7.60090246 \\approx 7.5140 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\nThe renormalized bending rigidity is then:\n$$ \\kappa_R(L) = \\kappa_0 - \\Delta\\kappa \\approx (1.035487 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}) - (7.5140 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}) $$\n$$ \\kappa_R(L) \\approx (10.35487 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}) - (0.75140 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}) $$\n$$ \\kappa_R(L) \\approx 9.60347 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $9.603 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\nAn alternative calculation path is to first compute the dimensionless coefficient:\n$$ \\kappa_R(L) = k_B T \\left(25 - \\frac{3}{4\\pi} \\ln(2000)\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{3}{4\\pi} \\ln(2000) \\approx \\frac{3}{12.56637} \\times 7.60090246 \\approx 0.23873 \\times 7.60090246 \\approx 1.81525 $$\n$$ \\kappa_R(L) \\approx k_B T (25 - 1.81525) = 23.18475 \\, k_B T $$\n$$ \\kappa_R(L) \\approx 23.18475 \\times (4.141947 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\approx 9.6025 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\nRounding this slightly different intermediate result to four significant figures gives $9.603 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}$, confirming the final answer.
