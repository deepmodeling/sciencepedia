Do not introduce phenomenological spring constants or fitting parameters.", "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in statistical polymer physics, free of scientific or logical flaws. We will now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is a freely-jointed polymer chain composed of $N$ rigid links, each of fixed length $b$. The end-to-end vector of the chain, $\\mathbf{R}$, is the vector sum of the individual link vectors, $\\mathbf{r}_i$:\n$$ \\mathbf{R} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{r}_i $$\nwhere $|\\mathbf{r}_i| = b$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $N$. The links are independently and isotropically oriented. The chain is held such that its end-to-end vector is fixed at $\\mathbf{R}$.\n\nFor a large number of links $N$, the Central Limit Theorem dictates that the probability distribution density for the end-to-end vector, $P(\\mathbf{R})$, will be a Gaussian distribution. This approximation holds in the specified regime of small extension, where the magnitude of the end-to-end vector $R = |\\mathbf{R}|$ is much smaller than the total contour length of the chain, i.e., $R \\ll Nb$.\n\nTo define this Gaussian distribution, we must first compute the mean and variance of $\\mathbf{R}$. Due to the isotropic orientation of each link, the average of any single link vector is the zero vector:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{r}_i \\rangle = \\mathbf{0} $$\nConsequently, the mean of the end-to-end vector is also zero:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{R} \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\langle \\mathbf{r}_i \\rangle = \\mathbf{0} $$\nNext, we compute the mean-square end-to-end distance, $\\langle R^2 \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle R^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\mathbf{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{R} \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{r}_i \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\mathbf{r}_j \\right) \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\langle \\mathbf{r}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_j \\rangle $$\nBecause the orientations of different links are independent, the average of the dot product of two different link vectors is zero: $\\langle \\mathbf{r}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_j \\rangle = \\langle \\mathbf{r}_i \\rangle \\cdot \\langle \\mathbf{r}_j \\rangle = \\mathbf{0}$ for $i \\neq j$. The cross-terms vanish, and the sum simplifies to:\n$$ \\langle R^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\langle \\mathbf{r}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_i \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\langle |\\mathbf{r}_i|^2 \\rangle $$\nSince each link has a fixed length $b$, we have $\\langle |\\mathbf{r}_i|^2 \\rangle = b^2$. Therefore, the mean-square end-to-end distance is:\n$$ \\langle R^2 \\rangle = N b^2 $$\nBy symmetry in $3$-dimensional space, the variance is distributed equally among the Cartesian components: $\\langle R_x^2 \\rangle = \\langle R_y^2 \\rangle = \\langle R_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{3} \\langle R^2 \\rangle = \\frac{Nb^2}{3}$. The probability density for the end-to-end vector $\\mathbf{R}$ is the product of three independent one-dimensional Gaussian distributions:\n$$ P(\\mathbf{R}) = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\langle R_x^2 \\rangle}} \\right)^3 \\exp\\left( -\\frac{R_x^2 + R_y^2 + R_z^2}{2 \\langle R_x^2 \\rangle} \\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2 \\pi N b^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3R^2}{2 N b^2}\\right) $$\nThe number of microscopic configurations, $W(\\mathbf{R})$, corresponding to a macroscopic state defined by $\\mathbf{R}$ is proportional to this probability density, $W(\\mathbf{R}) \\propto P(\\mathbf{R})$. Using the Boltzmann definition of entropy, $S = k_{B} \\ln W$, we find the configurational entropy as a function of $R$:\n$$ S(R) = k_{B} \\ln [C \\cdot P(\\mathbf{R})] = k_{B} \\ln(C) + k_{B} \\ln(P(\\mathbf{R})) $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality.

The change in entropy due to extension is:\n$$ S(R) = S_0 - \\frac{3 k_{B} R^2}{2 N b^2} $$\nThe entropy decreases quadratically as the chain is stretched, reflecting an increase in order.\n\nThe Helmholtz free energy is $A = U - TS$. The problem states that there are no conformation-dependent energetic interactions, meaning the internal energy $U$ is independent of $R$. Therefore, any change in free energy upon extension is purely entropic.\n$$ A(R) = U - T S(R) = U - T \\left( S_0 - \\frac{3 k_{B} R^2}{2 N b^2} \\right) = (U-TS_0) + \\frac{3 k_{B} T R^2}{2 N b^2} $$\nLetting $A_0 = U-TS_0$ be the free energy of the un-stretched chain, we have:\n$$ A(R) = A_0 + \\frac{3 k_{B} T R^2}{2 N b^2} $$\nThe magnitude of the tensile force, $F$, required to maintain the extension $R$ at a constant temperature $T$ is given by the partial derivative of the Helmholtz free energy with respect to the extension $R$:\n$$ F = \\left(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial R}\\right)_{T} $$\nWe perform the differentiation:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R} \\left( A_0 + \\frac{3 k_{B} T R^2}{2 N b^2} \\right) = \\frac{3 k_{B} T}{2 N b^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R}(R^2) = \\frac{3 k_{B} T}{2 N b^2} (2R) $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the entropic force in the Gaussian approximation:\n$$ F = \\frac{3 k_{B} T R}{N b^2} $$\nThis result shows a linear relationship between force and extension, characteristic of a Hookean spring, where the effective spring constant is $\\frac{3 k_{B} T}{N b^2}$.

However, the given potential, $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)=\\tfrac{1}{2}k x^{2}$, is centered at the origin and thus provides a restoring force towards $x=0$, supplementing the polymer's own restoring force. This makes the setup a confinement experiment rather than a pulling experiment. This is a matter of imprecise terminology but does not create a contradiction in the physics or mathematics if we take the explicit formula for $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)$ as the definitive description of the potential. The problem remains solvable and self-consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. We proceed to a full solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe system, comprising the polymer and the microsphere in the trap, is in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$. The probability density $P(x)$ of finding the microsphere at position $x$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution for the total potential of mean force, which is the total Helmholtz free energy $A_{\\mathrm{total}}(x)$.\n\nThe total free energy is the sum of the polymer's internal free energy, $A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)$, and the potential energy of the microsphere in the optical trap, $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)$:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{total}}(x) = A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) + U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)$$\nAccording to the principles of the canonical ensemble, the probability density $P(x)$ is:\n$$P(x) = \\frac{1}{Z} e^{-A_{\\mathrm{total}}(x) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$$\nwhere $Z$ is the partition function and $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThis relation can be inverted to express the total free energy in terms of the probability density:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{total}}(x) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln P(x) + C$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. From this, we can isolate the polymer's free energy:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) = A_{\\mathrm{total}}(x) - U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln P(x) - U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x) + C$$\nThe entropic force exerted *by the polymer* on the microsphere, $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)$, is defined as the negative gradient of the polymer's free energy:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\equiv -\\frac{d A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)}{dx}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) = -\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln P(x) - U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x) + C \\right)$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln P(x) + \\frac{d U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)}{dx}$$\nThis is the general expression connecting the polymer force to the measured probability distribution and the trap potential. The experimental histogram $\\hat{P}(x)$ is used as an estimate for $P(x)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under the stated conditions with $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)=\\tfrac{1}{2}k x^{2}$, the polymer’s entropic force can be inferred from the measured histogram via $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\,\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\ln \\hat{P}(x)+k\\,x$, where $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant.**\n\nFor the given potential $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}k x^2$, the derivative is $\\frac{d U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)}{dx} = kx$. Substituting this into our general formula and using $\\hat{P}(x)$ for $P(x)$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln \\hat{P}(x) + kx$$\nThis expression matches the statement in option A precisely. The logic is sound and follows directly from first principles.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The polymer’s entropic force can be inferred from the measured histogram without regard to the optical potential as $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\,\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\ln \\hat{P}(x)$.**\n\nThis statement is equivalent to setting the term from the optical trap to zero. Our derivation shows that $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)$ is recovered from the total energy landscape by subtracting the known contribution from the trap. The measured distribution $\\hat{P}(x)$ is a convolution of the polymer and trap potentials; to deconvolve them, knowledge of the trap potential is essential. The expression in B would only be valid if $k=0$ (no trap), but the problem specifies a trap with stiffness $k$. Therefore, ignoring the trap potential leads to an incorrect inference.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. If instead the measured coordinate is the three-dimensional end-to-end distance $r$ and the trap is spherically symmetric, $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(r)=\\tfrac{1}{2}k r^{2}$, then the correct inference compensates for configurational degeneracy, giving $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r)=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\,\\dfrac{d}{dr}\\ln\\!\\big[\\hat{P}(r)/r^{2}\\big]+k\\,r$.**\n\nWe extend the analysis to three dimensions with spherical symmetry. The total free energy depends on the radial distance $r$: $A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) = A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r) + U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(r)$. The probability of finding the bead in a volume element $d^3\\mathbf{r}$ is proportional to $e^{-A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} d^3\\mathbf{r}$.\nThe measured histogram $\\hat{P}(r)$ is a radial probability density, meaning $\\hat{P}(r)dr$ is the probability of finding the bead at a distance between $r$ and $r+dr$. This is obtained by integrating over a spherical shell of volume $4\\pi r^2 dr$.\n$$P(r)dr \\propto e^{-A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} (4\\pi r^2 dr)$$\n$$P(r) \\propto r^2 e^{-A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$$\nThe term $r^2$ is a geometric (Jacobian) factor reflecting the increasing volume of phase space available at larger radii.\nInverting for $A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r)$:\n$$e^{-A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} \\propto \\frac{P(r)}{r^2} \\implies A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln \\left( \\frac{P(r)}{r^2} \\right) + C'$$\nThe polymer free energy is $A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r) = A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) - U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(r)$.\nThe radial force is $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r) = -\\frac{d A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r)}{dr}$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r) = -\\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln \\left( \\frac{P(r)}{r^2} \\right) - U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(r) \\right]$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\frac{d}{dr} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P(r)}{r^2} \\right) + \\frac{d U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(r)}{dr}$$\nUsing $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(r) = \\frac{1}{2}kr^2$, its derivative is $\\frac{dU_{\\mathrm{trap}}}{dr}=kr$. Replacing $P(r)$ with $\\hat{P}(r)$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\frac{d}{dr} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\hat{P}(r)}{r^2} \\right) + kr$$\nThis expression correctly compensates for the configurational degeneracy via the $1/r^2$ term and matches the statement.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. For finite trap stiffness, it is sufficient to replace $x$ by its time average $\\langle x\\rangle$ and drop the derivative term, so that $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(\\langle x\\rangle)=k\\,\\langle x\\rangle$ holds generally for equilibrium data.**\n\nLet us take the average of the correct expression from option A:\n$$\\langle F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\rangle = \\left\\langle kx + k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln P(x) \\right\\rangle$$\n$$\\langle F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\rangle = \\int \\left( kx + k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\frac{P'(x)}{P(x)} \\right) P(x) dx$$\n$$\\langle F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\rangle = k \\int x P(x) dx + k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\int P'(x) dx$$\n$$\\langle F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\rangle = k \\langle x \\rangle + k_{\\mathrm{B}}T [P(x)]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}$$\nSince $P(x)$ must vanish at the boundaries of the accessible region, the boundary term is zero. Thus, we have the exact relation for the average forces:\n$$\\langle F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\rangle = k \\langle x \\rangle$$\nHowever, option D states $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(\\langle x\\rangle) = k \\langle x \\rangle$. This replaces the average of the function, $\\langle F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\rangle$, with the function of the average, $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(\\langle x\\rangle)$. For any non-linear function $f(x)$, it is generally true that $\\langle f(x) \\rangle \\neq f(\\langle x \\rangle)$ due to fluctuations. Polymer force-extension relations are fundamentally non-linear. The approximation is only valid in the limit of an infinitely stiff trap ($k \\to \\infty$), where fluctuations vanish ($\\sigma_x \\to 0$) and $\\langle x \\rangle \\to x$.
