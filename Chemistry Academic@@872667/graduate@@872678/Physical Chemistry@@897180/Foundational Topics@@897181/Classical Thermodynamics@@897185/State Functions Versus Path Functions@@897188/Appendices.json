Its validity is confirmed, and we proceed to a rigorous analysis. The central issue is the distinction between a state function, which depends only on the thermodynamic state of a system, and a path function, which depends on the process or path taken between states. A thermodynamic property is a state function if and only if its differential is exact. For a function $Z(x, y)$, its differential $dZ = M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy$ is exact if and only if $\\left(\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y}\\right)_x = \\left(\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x}\\right)_y$. The change in a state function over any cyclic process is zero.\n\nWe shall now evaluate each statement with the requisite rigor.\n\nA. The scalar quantity $PV$ evaluated at an equilibrium state is a state function.\nThe problem statement specifies a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, for which state variables such as pressure ($P$) and volume ($V$) are well-defined. By definition, a state function is any property that has a unique value for a given equilibrium state. Since $P$ and $V$ are themselves state functions (properties of state), any mathematical combination of them, such as their product $PV$, must also be a quantity uniquely determined by the state. The value of $PV$ at a given state (e.g., defined by $T$ and $P$) does not depend on the history of the system. Therefore, $PV$ is a state function. One can also note that the enthalpy, $H = U + PV$, would not be a state function if $PV$ were not, yet it is known to be one.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. For any quasistatic transformation from state $1$ to state $2$, the line integral $\\int_{1}^{2} P\\,dV$ is a state function; that is, it depends only on states $1$ and $2$.\nThe integral $\\int_{1}^{2} P\\,dV$ represents the reversible pressure-volume work, $W_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, done on the surroundings by the system. Work is a quintessential example of a path function. Its value depends on the specific path taken from state $1$ to state $2$ on a $P-V$ diagram. For instance, consider two states $(P_1, V_1)$ and $(P_2, V_2)$. One can proceed from state $1$ to state $2$ via an isobaric path followed by an isochoric path, or via an isothermal path. The area under the curve on the $P-V$ diagram, which represents the work, will be different for these distinct paths. The differential $\\delta W = P\\,dV$ is an inexact differential. Its integral is path-dependent. The statement is fundamentally incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The isobaric heat capacity $C_{P}$ of a homogeneous phase of fixed composition, defined at an equilibrium state as $C_{P}(T,P) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P}$ with $H$ the enthalpy, is a state function.\nThe isobaric heat capacity $C_P$ is defined as a property of a substance at a given equilibrium state. The quantities used in its definition—enthalpy ($H$), temperature ($T$), and pressure ($P$)—are all state functions. A property, such as $C_P$, that is defined in terms of state variables and their derivatives at a single point in state space must itself be a state function (or, more precisely, a property of state). For any given state specified by $(T, P)$, $C_P$ has a unique, definite value, irrespective of how that state was reached.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. For a transition between equilibrium states $1$ and $2$, the integral $\\int_{1}^{2} \\frac{\\delta Q_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{T}$ is independent of the reversible path chosen and equals $S(2)-S(1)$, where $S$ is entropy.\nThis statement is the mathematical formulation of the second law of thermodynamics for a reversible process, defining the change in the state function entropy, $S$. While heat, $Q$, is a path function (its differential $\\delta Q$ is inexact), multiplication by the integrating factor $1/T$ for a reversible path transforms it into an exact differential, $dS = \\frac{\\delta Q_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{T}$. The integral of an exact differential depends only on the initial and final states, not on the path of integration. Thus, $\\int_{1}^{2} dS = S(2) - S(1)$. This is the definition of entropy change and is a fundamental principle.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. For arbitrary processes between equilibrium states $1$ and $2$, the integral $\\int_{1}^{2} \\frac{C_{P}}{T}\\,dT$, evaluated along the actual process path, is independent of path.\nThis statement alleges that the given integral is path-independent. For a general system, the isobaric heat capacity $C_P$ is a function of two independent variables, for instance, temperature and pressure, $C_P(T,P)$. The expression to be integrated is $\\frac{C_P(T,P)}{T} dT$. This is a line integral, and its value depends on the path, i.e., the specific relation between $P$ and $T$ during the process. For this integral to be path-independent, the differential form $\\frac{C_P}{T}dT$ would need to be an exact differential. Let us consider the state as a function of $T$ and $P$. The total differential of a hypothetical state function $\\Phi(T,P)$ is $d\\Phi = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial T}\\right)_P dT + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial P}\\right)_T dP$. If the integral were path-independent, we could write $d\\Phi = \\frac{C_P(T,P)}{T} dT$, which implies $\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = 0$. For $d\\Phi$ to be exact, the Maxwell relation must hold: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}\\left(\\frac{C_P}{T}\\right)_T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}(0)_P = 0$. This requires $\\frac{1}{T}\\left(\\frac{\\partial C_P}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = 0$, or $\\left(\\frac{\\partial C_P}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = 0$. This condition is only met for an ideal gas. For real substances, $\\left(\\frac{\\partial C_P}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = -T\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial T^2}\\right)_P \\neq 0$ generally. Therefore, the integral is path-dependent for an arbitrary process.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nF. For any reversible cycle, $\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{T} = 0$.\nThis is a direct consequence of entropy, $S$, being a state function. As established in point D, $\\int_{1}^{2} \\frac{\\delta Q_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{T} = S(2) - S(1)$. A cycle is a process where the final state is identical to the initial state, i.e., state $2$ is the same as state $1$. For such a process, the change in any state function must be zero. Therefore, $\\Delta S = S(\\text{final}) - S(\\text{initial}) = S(1) - S(1) = 0$. This leads to the conclusion that the cyclic integral $\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{T} = \\oint dS = 0$. This result is known as the Clausius theorem for reversible cycles.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDF}$$", "id": "2668781"}, {"introduction": "Theory comes to life through calculation.

We separate the variables $\\mu$ and $V$:\n$$\\frac{d\\mu}{\\mu} = \\frac{1-a}{a} \\frac{dV}{V}$$\nIntegrating both sides (and setting the constant of integration to zero, as any non-zero integrating factor is sufficient):\n$$\\int \\frac{d\\mu}{\\mu} = \\int \\frac{1-a}{a} \\frac{dV}{V}$$\n$$\\ln|\\mu| = \\frac{1-a}{a} \\ln|V| = \\ln\\left(|V|^{\\frac{1-a}{a}}\\right)$$\nThus, the integrating factor is:\n$$\\mu(V) = V^{\\frac{1-a}{a}}$$\nNow, we find the potential function $Y(V,P)$ whose differential is $dY = \\mu(V) dX$. We have:\n$$dY = P V^{\\frac{1-a}{a}} dV + aV V^{\\frac{1-a}{a}} dP = P V^{\\frac{1-a}{a}} dV + a V^{\\frac{1}{a}} dP$$\nFrom the definition of a total differential, we have:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial V}\\right)_{P} = P V^{\\frac{1-a}{a}}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial P}\\right)_{V} = a V^{\\frac{1}{a}}$$\nWe can integrate the second equation with respect to $P$ at constant $V$:\n$$Y(V,P) = \\int aV^{\\frac{1}{a}} dP = a P V^{\\frac{1}{a}} + g(V)$$\nwhere $g(V)$ is an arbitrary function of $V$, acting as the constant of integration. To determine $g(V)$, we differentiate this expression for $Y(V,P)$ with respect to $V$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial V}\\right)_{P} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V} \\left(a P V^{\\frac{1}{a}} + g(V)\\right) = a P \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right) V^{\\frac{1}{a}-1} + g'(V) = P V^{\\frac{1-a}{a}} + g'(V)$$\nComparing this with the first equation for $(\\partial Y / \\partial V)_P$:\n$$P V^{\\frac{1-a}{a}} + g'(V) = P V^{\\frac{1-a}{a}}$$\nThis implies that $g'(V) = 0$, so $g(V)$ is a constant, which we denote as $C$.\nThe potential function $Y(V,P)$, which is a state function, is therefore:\n$$Y(V,P) = a P V^{\\frac{1}{a}} + C$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1 - a} $$", "id": "2668817"}]}
