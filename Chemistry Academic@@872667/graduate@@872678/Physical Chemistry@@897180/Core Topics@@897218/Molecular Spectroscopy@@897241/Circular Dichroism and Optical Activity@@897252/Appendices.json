This dependence arises primarily from the temperature-induced shift in the conformational equilibrium of the chiral molecule. Different conformers of a flexible molecule typically have different optical rotations. The observed specific rotation is a Boltzmann-weighted average over all populated conformers. A change in temperature from $20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ will alter the Boltzmann distribution, changing the relative populations of the conformers and thus changing the value of $[\\alpha]$. A secondary, smaller effect is the temperature dependence of the solvent's refractive index. Therefore, using the value of $[\\alpha]$ at $20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to predict the rotation at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ introduces a systematic error, as the true value of $[\\alpha]$ at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ would be different.\n\n(ii) Effect of finite spectral bandwidth: The specific rotation is also a function of wavelength, a phenomenon known as optical rotatory dispersion (ORD). The calculation assumes the use of perfectly monochromatic light at precisely $\\lambda = 546\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Any real light source, however, possesses a finite spectral bandwidth, meaning it emits a distribution of wavelengths centered around $546\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The observed rotation is the integrated effect over this wavelength distribution, weighted by the spectral intensity. Since $[\\alpha]$ is a function of $\\lambda$, the measured rotation will be an average value, $\\langle\\alpha(\\lambda)\\rangle$, over the bandwidth. If the ORD curve, $[\\alpha]$ versus $\\lambda$, is non-linear across the spectral bandwidth, this average value will differ from the value at the central wavelength, $\\alpha(546\\,\\mathrm{nm})$. This deviation is particularly pronounced near an electronic transition, where $[\\alpha]$ changes rapidly with $\\lambda$ (the Cotton effect). Using a value for a single wavelength to predict the result from a source with a finite bandwidth neglects this effect and reduces the accuracy of the prediction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.05}\n$$", "id": "2628896"}, {"introduction": "While polarimetry provides a single value at a given wavelength, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy offers rich, wavelength-dependent information.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires deriving an explicit expression for the temperature-dependent ellipticity, $\\theta(T)$. The observed ellipticity is stated to be proportional to the population-weighted average rotatory strength, $\\overline{R}(T)$. We can write this relationship as $\\theta(T) = C \\cdot \\overline{R}(T)$, where $C$ is a proportionality constant.\n\nThe average rotatory strength is given by:\n$$\n\\overline{R}(T) = x_A(T) R_{0n}^{(A)} + x_B(T) R_{0n}^{(B)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $R_{0n}^{(A)} = +R_0$ and $R_{0n}^{(B)} = -R_0$:\n$$\n\\overline{R}(T) = x_A(T) (+R_0) + x_B(T) (-R_0) = R_0 (x_A(T) - x_B(T))\n$$\nThe proportionality constant $C$ can be determined from the calibration measurement for pure conformer $A$. For pure $A$, $x_A=1$ and $x_B=0$, so $\\overline{R} = R_0$. The corresponding ellipticity is given as $\\theta_A^0$. Thus, $\\theta_A^0 = C \\cdot R_0$, which implies $C = \\theta_A^0 / R_0$.\n\nNow we can write the expression for $\\theta(T)$:\n$$\n\\theta(T) = C \\cdot \\overline{R}(T) = \\frac{\\theta_A^0}{R_0} \\cdot R_0 (x_A(T) - x_B(T)) = \\theta_A^0 (x_A(T) - x_B(T))\n$$\nThe mole fractions $x_A(T)$ and $x_B(T)$ are related by the equilibrium constant $K(T) = x_B(T) / x_A(T)$ and the conservation condition $x_A(T) + x_B(T) = 1$. From these two relations, we can express the mole fractions in terms of $K(T)$:\n$$\nx_A(T) = \\frac{1}{1 + K(T)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_B(T) = \\frac{K(T)}{1 + K(T)}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\theta(T)$:\n$$\n\\theta(T) = \\theta_A^0 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K(T)} - \\frac{K(T)}{1 + K(T)} \\right) = \\theta_A^0 \\frac{1 - K(T)}{1 + K(T)}\n$$\nThe equilibrium constant is governed by the Gibbs free energy difference, $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$, through the relation $K(T) = \\exp(-\\Delta G / (RT))$.

In your analysis you may rely on the following foundational bases (without assuming any target formulas): (i) electronic circular dichroism arises from differences in absorption of left- versus right-circularly polarized light and is governed by the electronic rotatory strength; (ii) in solution, observable spectroscopic quantities are ensemble averages over conformer populations that follow Boltzmann statistics; (iii) solvent can change conformer free energies through differential solvation and specific interactions; (iv) oriented samples can exhibit artifacts due to linear dichroism.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identify a plausible pitfall and propose an appropriate control to support a robust absolute configuration assignment for this system?

A shift in the conformational Boltzmann distribution between $n$-hexane and methanol could invert the sign of the ensemble-averaged rotatory strength of the exciton couplet; this can be tested by temperature-dependent ECD to model a two-state conformer equilibrium via a van’t Hoff analysis, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) conformational analysis (e.g., nuclear Overhauser effect and scalar couplings), and by conformer-averaged ECD calculations that explicitly include solvent effects.\n\nB.

Intermolecular aggregation in methanol could produce an exciton couplet unrelated to the intramolecular geometry that dominates in $n$-hexane; this can be evaluated by concentration-dependent ECD and ultraviolet–visible absorption to test linear scaling with concentration, and by dynamic light scattering (DLS) to assess aggregate formation.\n\nE. Recording vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) in the carbonyl stretch region and comparing conformer-averaged ab initio spectra that include solvent effects provides an orthogonal probe of absolute configuration that is less sensitive to the particular exciton coupling responsible for the ultraviolet ECD couplet; agreement across solvents supports the assignment.\n\nF.

It is entirely plausible that conformers with positive chirality are favored in *n*-hexane, while conformers with negative chirality are favored in methanol. This shift in the Boltzmann populations ($p_i$) can lead to an inversion of the sign of the ensemble-averaged ECD couplet, $\\Delta\\epsilon_{obs}$, while the absorption spectrum ($\\epsilon$), which depends mainly on $|\\vec{\\mu}_1|^2 + |\\vec{\\mu}_2|^2$, remains similar.\n\nAny robust assignment of absolute configuration must rigorously account for this conformational equilibrium and rule out other phenomena such as aggregation or experimental artifacts.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.** A shift in the conformational Boltzmann distribution between *n*-hexane and methanol could invert the sign of the ensemble-averaged rotatory strength of the exciton couplet; this can be tested by temperature-dependent ECD to model a two-state conformer equilibrium via a van’t Hoff analysis, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) conformational analysis (e.g., nuclear Overhauser effect and scalar couplings), and by conformer-averaged ECD calculations that explicitly include solvent effects.\n-   **Analysis:** This statement correctly identifies the most probable cause of the sign inversion – a solvent-induced shift in the conformational equilibrium.

Linear dichroism (LD) combined with instrument birefringence can produce false CD signals. While it is perhaps less likely to cause a perfect, symmetric sign inversion between two standard solvents than a conformational change, it is a potential pitfall that must be eliminated. The proposed control, rotating the sample cuvette by $90^\\circ$ and verifying that the spectrum does not change, is the standard procedure to test for such artifacts in an isotropic solution. A careful scientist must perform this check.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**D.** Intermolecular aggregation in methanol could produce an exciton couplet unrelated to the intramolecular geometry that dominates in *n*-hexane; this can be evaluated by concentration-dependent ECD and ultraviolet–visible absorption to test linear scaling with concentration, and by dynamic light scattering (DLS) to assess aggregate formation.\n-   **Analysis:** This statement identifies another critical and plausible pitfall. The change in solvent from non-polar (*n*-hexane) to polar, protic (methanol) can induce aggregation (e.g., via solvophobic effects). Such aggregates can exhibit strong intermolecular exciton coupling, which may dominate the spectrum and have a sign different from that of the monomer. The proposed controls are entirely appropriate. If the signal arises from a single species (monomer), its intensity should obey the Beer-Lambert law (linear dependence on concentration). Deviation from linearity is a strong indicator of aggregation. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) is a direct physical method to detect the presence and size of aggregates.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**E.** Recording vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) in the carbonyl stretch region and comparing conformer-averaged ab initio spectra that include solvent effects provides an orthogonal probe of absolute configuration that is less sensitive to the particular exciton coupling responsible for the ultraviolet ECD couplet; agreement across solvents supports the assignment.\n-   **Analysis:** This proposes a sophisticated and robust validation strategy. VCD is a chiroptical technique that probes vibrational transitions. Its physical origin is different from ECD. While also being an average over the conformational ensemble, the VCD spectrum is sensitive to the entire molecular structure in a way that is not dominated by a single exciton-coupling interaction. Using VCD provides an orthogonal (independent) piece of evidence. If computational models can predict the VCD spectra in both solvents for a single absolute configuration, this greatly strengthens the confidence in that assignment. The mention of \"carbonyl stretch\" is illustrative; the principle applies to other characteristic vibrations.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**F.** Fitting only the methanol ECD spectrum with a single-conformer gas-phase time-dependent density functional theory calculation is sufficient for absolute configuration assignment because the sign of the lowest-energy band is determined solely by the intrinsic chirality of the chromophore and is insensitive to conformational averaging.\n-   **Analysis:** This statement advocates a scientifically unsound and lazy approach. It ignores three key facts of the problem: ($1$) the system is conformationally flexible, so a single-conformer model is inadvisable; ($2$) the effect is solvent-dependent, so a gas-phase calculation is inappropriate for a methanol solution; ($3$) the spectrum is an exciton couplet, whose sign is determined by the *relative orientation* of the chromophores, not an \"intrinsic chirality\" of an individual chromophore (which is likely achiral anyway). This approach is guaranteed to be misleading.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**G.** If the anisotropy factor $g(\\lambda) = \\Delta\\epsilon(\\lambda)/\\epsilon(\\lambda)$ is invariant with concentration and the ECD amplitude scales linearly with concentration in a given solvent, the signal is unlikely to arise from aggregation; performing this test in each solvent helps distinguish solvent-specific conformational effects from aggregation artifacts.\n-   **Analysis:** This is a more rigorous formulation of the concentration-dependence test mentioned in option D. The anisotropy factor $g(\\lambda)$ is an intrinsic property of a chiral species. If only one species (the monomer) is present, $g(\\lambda)$ must be independent of concentration. If an aggregate with a different $g_{agg}(\\lambda)$ forms, the observed $g_{obs}(\\lambda)$ will become a function of concentration as the monomer-aggregate equilibrium shifts. Verifying the invariance of the $g(\\lambda)$ factor and linearity of $\\Delta\\epsilon$ is a robust method to rule out aggregation as the source of the spectral changes. This test is essential to distinguish between the aggregation hypothesis (D) and the conformational equilibrium hypothesis (A).\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDEG}$$", "id": "2628881"}]}
