All necessary definitions, conditions, and assumptions are provided, and the problem is scientifically grounded and internally consistent. It is therefore deemed valid. The solution proceeds by following the structured steps outlined in the problem.\n\nThe analysis begins with two fundamental equations. The first is the Poisson equation, which relates the electrostatic potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$ to the local charge density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{\\rho(\\mathbf{r})}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$ is the absolute permittivity of the solvent. The local charge density is the sum over all mobile ionic species $i$:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_i z_i e n_i(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nwhere $z_i$ is the valence of ion $i$, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $n_i(\\mathbf{r})$ is the local number density of ion $i$.\n\nThe second fundamental relation is the Boltzmann distribution, which connects the local number density $n_i(\\mathbf{r})$ to the bulk number density $n_i^0$ and the local electrostatic potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$\nn_i(\\mathbf{r}) = n_i^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_i e \\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\n**1) Derivation of the Linearized Poisson-Boltzmann Equation and Debye Parameter $\\kappa$**\n\nWe substitute the Boltzmann distribution into the expression for the charge density:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_i z_i e n_i^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_i e \\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the potential is small, $|z_i e \\phi| \\ll k_B T$. This permits the linearization of the exponential function, $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x$ for small $x$. Applying this approximation:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx \\sum_i z_i e n_i^0 \\left(1 - \\frac{z_i e \\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right) = \\sum_i z_i e n_i^0 - \\left(\\sum_i \\frac{n_i^0 z_i^2 e^2}{k_B T}\\right) \\phi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe first term, $\\sum_i z_i e n_i^0$, represents the net charge density of the bulk solution, which must be zero due to the principle of electroneutrality. Therefore, the expression for the charge density of the ionic atmosphere simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx -\\left(\\frac{e^2}{k_B T} \\sum_i n_i^0 z_i^2\\right) \\phi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nSubstituting this linearized charge density into the Poisson equation yields the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation (LPBE):\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\left(\\frac{e^2}{k_B T} \\sum_i n_i^0 z_i^2\\right) \\phi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThis is of the form $\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\kappa^2 \\phi$, where $\\kappa^2$ is the square of the Debye screening parameter:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon k_B T} \\sum_i n_i^0 z_i^2\n$$\nTo express $\\kappa$ in terms of the ionic strength $I$, we use the given relations: $I = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_i c_i z_i^2$ (with concentration $c_i$ in $\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$) and $n_i^0 = N_A c_i \\times 10^3$ (where $N_A$ is the Avogadro constant and the factor $10^3$ converts $\\mathrm{L^{-1}}$ to $\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$). Substituting for $n_i^0$:\n$$\n\\sum_i n_i^0 z_i^2 = \\sum_i (N_A c_i \\times 10^3) z_i^2 = (N_A \\times 10^3) \\sum_i c_i z_i^2\n$$\nFrom the definition of ionic strength, we have $\\sum_i c_i z_i^2 = 2I$. Thus:\n$$\n\\sum_i n_i^0 z_i^2 = 2 I N_A \\times 10^3\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\kappa^2$:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon k_B T} (2 I N_A \\times 10^3) = \\frac{2 N_A e^2 \\times 10^3}{\\epsilon k_B T} I\n$$\nThe Debye screening parameter $\\kappa$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 N_A e^2 \\times 10^3}{\\epsilon k_B T} I}\n$$\n\n**2) Potential, Excess Chemical Potential, and Activity Coefficient**\n\nFor a central ion of charge $q = z_0 e$ at the origin, the potential is spherically symmetric, $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\phi(r)$. The LPBE in spherical coordinates becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{d\\phi}{dr}\\right) = \\kappa^2 \\phi(r)\n$$\nThe general solution to this differential equation is:\n$$\n\\phi(r) = C_1 \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa r)}{r} + C_2 \\frac{\\exp(\\kappa r)}{r}\n$$\nWe apply two boundary conditions. First, the potential must vanish at infinity, $\\phi(r \\to \\infty) = 0$, which requires $C_2 = 0$. Second, as $r \\to 0$, the potential must approach that of the bare central ion in the dielectric continuum, $\\phi(r) \\to \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon r}$. For small $r$, the solution behaves as $\\phi(r) \\approx C_1/r$. Comparing these determines the constant $C_1 = \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon}$. The potential is therefore:\n$$\n\\phi(r) = \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon} \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa r)}{r}\n$$\nThis total potential can be separated into the potential of the bare ion, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{ion}}(r) = \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon r}$, and the potential due to the ionic atmosphere, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{atm}}(r)$:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{atm}}(r) = \\phi(r) - \\phi_{\\mathrm{ion}}(r) = \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon r} (\\exp(-\\kappa r) - 1)\n$$\nThe excess chemical potential $\\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is the work done to charge the ion in the presence of its ionic atmosphere. This work is found by a reversible (Gibbs) charging process. The potential at the location of the central ion ($r=0$) created by its own atmosphere is found by taking the limit of $\\phi_{\\mathrm{atm}}(r)$ as $r \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{atm}}(0) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon} \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa r) - 1}{r} = \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon} (-\\kappa) = -\\frac{z_0 e \\kappa}{4\\pi\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe work done, $W$, to charge an ion of type $i$ from a charge of $0$ to its final charge $z_i e$ is calculated by integrating the electrostatic work. At an intermediate charge $\\lambda z_i e$ (with $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$), the potential of the atmosphere is $-\\frac{(\\lambda z_i e) \\kappa}{4\\pi\\epsilon}$. The incremental work to add charge $d q = (z_i e)d\\lambda$ is $dW = \\phi_{\\mathrm{atm}}(0) d q$.\n$$\n\\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}} = W = \\int_0^1 \\left(-\\frac{\\lambda z_i e \\kappa}{4\\pi\\epsilon}\\right) (z_i e \\, d\\lambda) = -\\frac{(z_i e)^2 \\kappa}{4\\pi\\epsilon} \\int_0^1 \\lambda \\, d\\lambda = -\\frac{(z_i e)^2 \\kappa}{4\\pi\\epsilon} \\left[\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2}\\right]_0^1\n$$\nThis yields the excess chemical potential:\n$$\n\\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}} = -\\frac{z_i^2 e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe activity coefficient $\\gamma_i$ is related to the excess chemical potential by $\\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}} = k_B T \\ln \\gamma_i$. Thus:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_i = \\frac{\\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}}}{k_B T} = -\\frac{z_i^2 e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T}\n$$\n\n**3) Mean Activity Coefficient and the Limiting-Law Constant $A$**\n\nFor an electrolyte $M_{\\nu_+}X_{\\nu_-}$, the mean activity coefficient $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ is defined by $\\gamma_{\\pm}^{\\nu_+ + \\nu_-} = \\gamma_+^{\\nu_+} \\gamma_-^{\\nu_-}$. For a symmetric $1:1$ electrolyte, $\\nu_+ = 1$, $\\nu_- = 1$, $z_+ = 1$, and $z_- = -1$. The definition becomes $\\gamma_{\\pm}^2 = \\gamma_+ \\gamma_-$. Taking the natural logarithm: $2 \\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = \\ln \\gamma_+ + \\ln \\gamma_-$.\nUsing the result from part 2:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_+ = -\\frac{(+1)^2 e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T} = -\\frac{e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_- = -\\frac{(-1)^2 e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T} = -\\frac{e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T}\n$$\nSumming these gives:\n$$\n2 \\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = -2\\frac{e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = -\\frac{e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\kappa$ in terms of ionic strength $I$:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = -\\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 N_A e^2 \\times 10^3}{\\epsilon k_B T} I} = -\\left( \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 N_A e^2 \\times 10^3}{\\epsilon k_B T}} \\right) \\sqrt{I}\n$$\nThis is of the form $\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = -A\\sqrt{I}$. The constant of proportionality, $A$, is identified as:\n$$\nA = \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 N_A e^2 \\times 10^3}{\\epsilon k_B T}} = \\frac{e^3 \\sqrt{2N_A \\times 10^3}}{8\\pi (\\epsilon k_B T)^{3/2}}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$, we obtain the explicit expression for $A$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{e^3 \\sqrt{2N_A \\times 10^3}}{8\\pi (\\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_r k_B T)^{3/2}}\n$$\n\n**4) Ratio of Mean Activity Coefficients**\n\nWe are given the limiting-law relationship $\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = -A\\sqrt{I}$, which holds for low ionic strength. We need to compute the ratio $\\gamma_{\\pm}(4I) / \\gamma_{\\pm}(I)$.\nFirst, we write the expression for $\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm}$ for each ionic strength:\nFor ionic strength $I$:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm}(I) = -A\\sqrt{I}\n$$\nFor ionic strength $4I$:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm}(4I) = -A\\sqrt{4I} = -A(2\\sqrt{I}) = -2A\\sqrt{I}\n$$\nTo find the ratio of the activity coefficients, we exponentiate these expressions:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\pm}(I) = \\exp(-A\\sqrt{I})\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\pm}(4I) = \\exp(-2A\\sqrt{I})\n$$\nThe ratio is then:\n$$\n\\frac{\\gamma_{\\pm}(4I)}{\\gamma_{\\pm}(I)} = \\frac{\\exp(-2A\\sqrt{I})}{\\exp(-A\\sqrt{I})} = \\exp(-2A\\sqrt{I} - (-A\\sqrt{I})) = \\exp(-A\\sqrt{I})\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the ratio in terms of $A$ and $I$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp(-A\\sqrt{I})}\n$$", "id": "2673299"}, {"introduction": "The Debye-Hückel model treats the solvent not as a collection of molecules, but as a continuous dielectric medium, making its permittivity $\\epsilon_r$ a crucial parameter.

This permits the linearization of the exponential term: $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$.\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx \\sum_{i} z_i e n_i^{0} \\left(1 - \\frac{z_i e \\psi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_{B} T}\\right) = \\sum_{i} n_i^{0} z_i e - \\left( \\sum_{i} \\frac{n_i^{0} z_i^2 e^2}{k_{B} T} \\right) \\psi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe first term, $\\sum_{i} n_i^{0} z_i e$, is the bulk charge density, which is zero due to the principle of macroscopic electroneutrality. Thus, the charge density in the ionic atmosphere is:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx - \\left( \\frac{e^2}{k_{B} T} \\sum_{i} n_i^{0} z_i^2 \\right) \\psi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Poisson equation gives the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\left( \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon k_{B} T} \\sum_{i} n_i^{0} z_i^2 \\right) \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\equiv \\kappa^2 \\psi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe parameter $\\kappa$ is the inverse of the Debye length, and its square is given by:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon k_{B} T} \\sum_{i} n_i^{0} z_i^2\n$$\nThe ionic strength $I$ is defined in terms of molar concentrations $c_i$ as $I = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i c_i z_i^2$. The bulk number density $n_i^0$ is related to the molar concentration $c_i$ by $n_i^0 = N_A c_i$, where $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant. Assuming molarity and molality are interchangeable in this dilute limit ($c_i \\approx m_i$ if concentrations are in $\\mathrm{mol\\, L^{-1}}$ and molalities in $\\mathrm{mol\\, kg^{-1}}$ and the solvent is water), we can write the sum in terms of $I$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} n_i^{0} z_i^2 = N_A \\sum_i c_i z_i^2 = 2 N_A I\n$$\n(If I is defined via molality, a solvent density factor appears, which is absorbed into the final constant $A$). Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{2 N_A e^2 I}{\\varepsilon k_{B} T} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\kappa = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 N_A e^2}{\\varepsilon k_{B} T}} \\sqrt{I}\n$$\nFor a spherically symmetric potential around a central ion $j$, the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{d\\psi}{dr}\\right) = \\kappa^2 \\psi(r)\n$$\nThe physically acceptable solution, which vanishes as $r \\to \\infty$ and correctly describes the potential of the central ion of charge $z_j e$ for $r \\to 0$, is:\n$$\n\\psi(r) = \\frac{z_j e}{4\\pi\\varepsilon r} \\exp(-\\kappa r)\n$$\nThe potential at the position of the central ion $(r \\to 0)$ due to its surrounding ionic atmosphere, $\\psi_{\\text{atm}}$, is found by subtracting the potential of the bare central ion itself:\n$$\n\\psi_{\\text{atm}}(0) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\left[ \\psi(r) - \\frac{z_j e}{4\\pi\\varepsilon r} \\right] = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\left[ \\frac{z_j e}{4\\pi\\varepsilon r} (1 - \\kappa r + \\dots) - \\frac{z_j e}{4\\pi\\varepsilon r} \\right] = -\\frac{z_j e \\kappa}{4\\pi\\varepsilon}\n$$\nThe excess chemical potential of ion $j$, $\\mu_j^{\\text{ex}}$, is the work done to charge the ion from $0$ to $z_j e$ in the presence of this atmosphere potential. This is related to the single-ion activity coefficient $\\gamma_j$ by $\\mu_j^{\\text{ex}} = k_B T \\ln \\gamma_j$.\n$$\n\\mu_j^{\\text{ex}} = \\int_0^{z_j e} \\psi_{\\text{atm}}(q) dq = \\int_0^{z_j e} \\left(-\\frac{q \\kappa}{4\\pi\\varepsilon}\\right) dq = -\\frac{(z_j e)^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\varepsilon}\n$$\nTherefore, the natural logarithm of the single-ion activity coefficient is:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_j = \\frac{\\mu_j^{\\text{ex}}}{k_B T} = -\\frac{z_j^2 e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\varepsilon k_B T}\n$$\nThe mean ionic activity coefficient $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ for an electrolyte $M_{\\nu_+}X_{\\nu_-}$ is defined by $\\gamma_{\\pm}^\\nu = \\gamma_+^{\\nu_+} \\gamma_-^{\\nu_-}$, where $\\nu = \\nu_+ + \\nu_-$. Taking the logarithm gives:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{\\nu} (\\nu_+ \\ln \\gamma_+ + \\nu_- \\ln \\gamma_-) = \\frac{1}{\\nu} \\left[ \\nu_+ \\left(-\\frac{z_+^2 e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\varepsilon k_B T}\\right) + \\nu_- \\left(-\\frac{z_-^2 e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\varepsilon k_B T}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = -\\frac{e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\varepsilon k_B T \\nu} (\\nu_+ z_+^2 + \\nu_- z_-^2)\n$$\nUsing the electroneutrality identity $\\nu_+ z_+^2 + \\nu_- z_-^2 = \\nu |z_+ z_-|$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = -\\frac{e^2 \\kappa |z_+ z_-|}{8\\pi\\varepsilon k_B T}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = - \\left( \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon k_B T} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 N_A e^2}{\\varepsilon k_B T}} \\right) |z_+ z_-| \\sqrt{I}\n$$\nConverting to base-10 logarithm ($\\log_{10} x = \\ln x / \\ln 10$):\n$$\n\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm} = - \\left( \\frac{e^3 \\sqrt{2N_A}}{(\\ln 10) 8\\pi (\\varepsilon k_B T)^{3/2}} \\right) |z_+ z_-| \\sqrt{I}\n$$\nThis is the Debye-Hückel limiting law, $\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm} = -A |z_+ z_-| \\sqrt{I}$, where the constant $A$ depends only on fundamental constants and properties of the solvent at a given temperature.\nThe problem defines the scaled decrement $S_{\\pm} = -\\frac{\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm}}{\\sqrt{I}}$. Substituting our derived expression gives:\n$$\nS_{\\pm} = -\\frac{-A |z_+ z_-| \\sqrt{I}}{\\sqrt{I}} = A |z_+ z_-|\n$$\nSince $A$ is constant for a fixed solvent and temperature, $S_{\\pm}$ depends on the electrolyte type only through the product of the absolute values of the ionic charges, $|z_+ z_-|$. This completes the theoretical proof.\n\nNow, we proceed with the numerical calculation.\nThe data are:\n1. $1{:}1$ electrolyte ($\\mathrm{MX}$): $z_+ = +1$, $z_- = -1$; $m_{11} = 0.0100\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg}^{-1}$; $\\gamma_{\\pm,11} = 0.8913$.\n2. $2{:}1$ electrolyte ($\\mathrm{MX_2}$): $z_+ = +2$, $z_- = -1$; $m_{21} = 3.333 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg}^{-1}$; $\\gamma_{\\pm,21} = 0.7943$.\n\nFirst, we verify the ionic strengths are matched. The problem allows the use of molality $m_i$ for concentration $c_i$.\nFor the $1{:}1$ electrolyte:\n$$\nI_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ m_{11}(+1)^2 + m_{11}(-1)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} (m_{11} + m_{11}) = m_{11} = 0.0100\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg}^{-1}\n$$\nFor the $2{:}1$ electrolyte, dissociation gives one ion of charge $+2$ and two ions of charge $-1$, so $m_+ = m_{21}$ and $m_- = 2m_{21}$.\n$$\nI_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ m_{21}(+2)^2 + (2m_{21})(-1)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} (4m_{21} + 2m_{21}) = 3m_{21}\n$$\n$$\nI_{21} = 3 \\times (3.333 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg}^{-1}) = 0.009999\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg}^{-1}\n$$\nThe ionic strengths are indeed matched to a high degree of precision ($I_{11} = 0.0100$ and $I_{21} = 0.009999$). We will use these calculated values.\n\nNext, we calculate $S_{\\pm}$ for each electrolyte using the definition $S_{\\pm} = -\\frac{\\log_{10}\\!\\gamma_{\\pm}}{\\sqrt{I}}$.\nFor the $1{:}1$ electrolyte:\n$$\nS_{\\pm}^{(1{:}1)} = -\\frac{\\log_{10}(0.8913)}{\\sqrt{0.0100}} = -\\frac{-0.0499743}{0.100} = 0.499743\n$$\nFor the $2{:}1$ electrolyte:\n$$\nS_{\\pm}^{(2{:}1)} = -\\frac{\\log_{10}(0.7943)}{\\sqrt{0.009999}} = -\\frac{-0.100002}{0.099995} = 1.00007\n$$\nFinally, we compute the diagnostic ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{S_{\\pm}^{(2{:}1)}}{S_{\\pm}^{(1{:}1)}} = \\frac{1.00007}{0.499743} = 2.0011...\n$$\nThis experimental ratio is very close to the theoretical prediction based on our derived formula $S_{\\pm} = A|z_+z_-|$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{theory}} = \\frac{|z_+ z_-|^{(2{:}1)}}{|z_+ z_-|^{(1{:}1)}} = \\frac{|(+2)(-1)|}{|(+1)(-1)|} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2\n$$\nThe experimental data are in excellent agreement with the theory. The problem asks for the numerical value of $R$ from the measured values, rounded to three significant figures.\nThe calculated value is $R = 2.0011...$. Rounding to three significant figures gives $2.00$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.00}\n$$", "id": "2673325"}]}
