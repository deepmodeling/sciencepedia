It is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe foundation of our analysis is the expression for the local volumetric rate of entropy production, $\\sigma_s$, for an irreversible process. For diffusion in a one-dimensional, isothermal system, this is given by:\n$$ T \\sigma_s = -J \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} $$\nwhere $J$ is the molar flux of the solute, $\\mu$ is its chemical potential, and $T$ is the constant absolute temperature.\n\nAccording to the formalism of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, in the linear regime near equilibrium, the thermodynamic flux is proportional to its conjugate thermodynamic force. From the entropy production equation, the flux is identified as $J$ and the conjugate force as $X = -d\\mu/dx$. The linear phenomenological relation is therefore:\n$$ J = L X = -L \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} $$\nwhere $L$ is the phenomenological transport coefficient, which is positive definite ($L  0$).\n\nThe problem specifies a dilute, non-electrolytic solution, for which the chemical potential $\\mu$ can be described by the ideal solution model:\n$$ \\mu(c) = \\mu^{\\circ}(T, P) + RT \\ln(c) $$\nwhere $\\mu^{\\circ}$ is the standard-state chemical potential (a function of $T$ and pressure $P$, but not concentration $c$), $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $c$ is the molar concentration.\n\nTo establish the constitutive relation for $J$ in terms of the concentration field $c(x)$, we must first express the force, $-d\\mu/dx$, in terms of the concentration gradient, $dc/dx$. We use the chain rule of differentiation:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} = \\frac{d\\mu}{dc} \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nThe derivative of $\\mu$ with respect to $c$ is found from its definition:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu}{dc} = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left( \\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln(c) \\right) = \\frac{RT}{c} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the gradient of the chemical potential yields:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} = \\left( \\frac{RT}{c} \\right) \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nNow, we insert this expression for the chemical potential gradient into our linear phenomenological law for the flux $J$:\n$$ J = -L \\left( \\frac{RT}{c} \\frac{dc}{dx} \\right) = -\\left(\\frac{LRT}{c}\\right) \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nThis equation is the derived constitutive relation. By comparing it to the empirical Fick's first law of diffusion, $J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$, we can identify the diffusion coefficient $D$ as:\n$$ D = \\frac{LRT}{c} $$\nThe problem states that $D$ is a constant, which implies that the phenomenological coefficient $L$ must be directly proportional to the concentration $c$, a condition that is consistent with more detailed kinetic theories (e.g., the Einstein relation, where the mobility is constant for a dilute system). With $D$ taken as a given constant, the derived constitutive relation is precisely Fick's first law:\n$$ J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\n\nWe now apply this law to compute the steady molar flux for the given linear concentration profile:\n$$ c(x) = c_0 + ax $$\nThe concentration gradient is found by differentiating $c(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} (c_0 + ax) = a $$\nSince the gradient is constant, the flux $J$ is also constant throughout the channel, which is a condition for a steady-state system with no internal sources or sinks. Substituting the gradient into the flux law gives:\n$$ J = -D a $$\nThis is the analytical expression for the steady molar flux.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the sign of $J$ when $a  0$. If $a  0$, the concentration gradient is positive, meaning the concentration increases in the positive $x$-direction. The second law of thermodynamics dictates that net transport of a species occurs spontaneously from a region of higher chemical potential (and thus higher concentration for an ideal solution) to a region of lower chemical potential. Consequently, the flux must be directed in the negative $x$-direction. Our result $J = -Da$ confirms this: since $D  0$ and we assume $a  0$, the product $-Da$ is negative, so $J  0$.\n\nFinally, we determine the SI units for the molar flux $J$. Molar flux represents the amount of substance (in moles) that flows across a unit area per unit time. Therefore, its units in the International System of Units (SI) are moles per square meter per second, which is written as $\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$. This is consistent with the units of the derived expression $J = -Da$: the units of $D$ are $\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$ and the units of $a = dc/dx$ are $(\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3})/\\text{m} = \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-4}$, so the product has units of $(\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-4}) = \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-D a}\n$$", "id": "2640913"}, {"introduction": "In many real-world systems, from geological formations to composite materials, the assumption of a constant diffusion coefficient is an oversimplification.

It is therefore deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe microscopic mass conservation for a species with concentration $c$ in a one-dimensional system without chemical reactions is given by the continuity equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\nwhere $J$ is the molar flux. At steady state, all time derivatives vanish, so $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. This implies:\n$$ \\frac{dJ}{dx} = 0 $$\nThis equation signifies that the steady-state flux $J$ must be constant throughout the slab, independent of the position $x$.\n\nThe local phenomenological relation between flux and concentration gradient in an inhomogeneous medium is given by Fick's first law:\n$$ J = -D(x) \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nHere, $J$ is the constant steady-state flux and $D(x)$ is the given position-dependent diffusion coefficient, $D(x) = D_0 (1 + \\alpha x)$. Combining these gives a first-order ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile $c(x)$:\n$$ J = -D_0 (1 + \\alpha x) \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nTo solve for $c(x)$, we separate the variables:\n$$ dc = -\\frac{J}{D_0 (1 + \\alpha x)} dx $$\nWe integrate this equation from the boundary at $x=0$ to an arbitrary position $x$ within the slab:\n$$ \\int_{c(0)}^{c(x)} dc' = -\\frac{J}{D_0} \\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha x'} dx' $$\nUsing the boundary condition $c(0) = c_0$, the left-hand side integrates to $c(x) - c_0$. The right-hand side integral is a standard logarithmic form:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{dx'}{1 + \\alpha x'} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln(1 + \\alpha x') \\right]_{0}^{x} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\ln(1 + \\alpha x) - \\ln(1) \\right) = \\frac{\\ln(1 + \\alpha x)}{\\alpha} $$\nThis integration is valid for $\\alpha \\neq 0$. The case $\\alpha = 0$ corresponds to a constant diffusion coefficient and can be recovered as a limit. Substituting the result of the integration, we obtain the concentration profile in terms of the yet unknown flux $J$:\n$$ c(x) - c_0 = -\\frac{J}{D_0} \\left( \\frac{\\ln(1 + \\alpha x)}{\\alpha} \\right) $$\n$$ c(x) = c_0 - \\frac{J}{\\alpha D_0} \\ln(1 + \\alpha x) $$\nTo determine the constant flux $J$, we apply the second boundary condition at $x=L$, where $c(L) = c_L$:\n$$ c_L = c_0 - \\frac{J}{\\alpha D_0} \\ln(1 + \\alpha L) $$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $J$:\n$$ \\frac{J}{\\alpha D_0} \\ln(1 + \\alpha L) = c_0 - c_L $$\n$$ J = \\frac{\\alpha D_0 (c_0 - c_L)}{\\ln(1 + \\alpha L)} $$\nThis is the exact closed-form expression for the steady-state flux.

This is precisely Fick's law for a constant diffusion coefficient $D_0$, which is expected. The first-order correction term indicates that the effective diffusion coefficient for the slab is approximately the arithmetic average of $D(x)$ over the interval $[0,L]$, since $\\bar{D} = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_0^L D_0(1+\\alpha x)dx = D_0(1+\\frac{\\alpha L}{2})$.\n\nCase 2: Large positive $\\alpha L$ (i.e., $\\alpha L \\to \\infty$)\nIn this limit, the diffusion coefficient increases steeply with $x$. The term $\\ln(1+\\alpha L)$ grows logarithmically with $\\alpha L$. The asymptotic behavior of the flux is:\n$$ J \\approx \\frac{\\alpha D_0 (c_0 - c_L)}{\\ln(\\alpha L)} $$\nThe flux grows with $\\alpha$, but sub-linearly, as $\\alpha/\\ln(\\alpha)$.\nPhysical interpretation: An alternative expression for the flux is $J = (c_0-c_L) / R_{diff}$, where $R_{diff} = \\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{D(x)}$ is the total diffusive resistance. Here, $R_{diff} = \\frac{\\ln(1+\\alpha L)}{\\alpha D_0}$. As $\\alpha \\to \\infty$, the local resistivity $1/D(x) = 1/(D_0(1+\\alpha x))$ becomes very large for small $x$ and very small for large $x$. The total resistance is therefore dominated by the region near $x=0$. The majority of the concentration drop occurs in a thin layer near $x=0$ where the diffusivity is lowest, while the concentration profile is nearly flat across the rest of the slab where diffusivity is high. The system's bottleneck is the entry region at $x=0$. While increasing $\\alpha$ makes most of the slab highly permeable, the flux remains limited by this bottleneck, explaining the sub-linear growth of $J$ with $\\alpha$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\alpha D_0 (c_0 - c_L)}{\\ln(1 + \\alpha L)}}\n$$", "id": "2640881"}, {"introduction": "Diffusion rarely occurs in isolation; it is frequently coupled with simultaneous chemical reactions, a scenario central to catalysis, cell biology, and chemical engineering.

All necessary conditions and parameters are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore valid. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing differential equation from the principle of conservation of mass. Consider a differential control volume element of the slab with area $A$ and thickness $\\Delta x$, from position $x$ to $x + \\Delta x$. The mass balance for the solute in this volume is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Accumulation} = \\text{Rate of Inflow} - \\text{Rate of Outflow} + \\text{Rate of Generation}\n$$\nIn mathematical terms, this is written as:\n$$\nA \\Delta x \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = (A J_x)|_x - (A J_x)|_{x+\\Delta x} + R (A \\Delta x)\n$$\nwhere $c(x,t)$ is the solute concentration, $J_x$ is the molar flux in the $x$-direction, and $R$ is the volumetric rate of reaction.

We are given two constitutive relations. First, Fick's first law defines the diffusive flux:\n$$\nJ_x = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusivity, which is stated to be a constant. Second, the solute is consumed by a first-order reaction with rate $R = -k c$, where $k$ is a positive rate constant. Substituting these into the conservation equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right) - k c\n$$\nSince $D$ is constant, it can be taken out of the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} - k c\n$$\nThis is the general reaction-diffusion equation for this system. The problem asks for the steady-state concentration profile, $c(x)$, which means the concentration does not change with time. Therefore, the accumulation term is zero: $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The partial derivatives with respect to $x$ become ordinary derivatives, as $c$ is now only a function of $x$. The steady-state governing equation is:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - k c = 0\n$$\nwhich can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - \\frac{k}{D} c = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order, linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nNext, we must state the boundary conditions.\n1. At the boundary $x=0$, the concentration is held at a constant value $c_0$:\n$$\nc(0) = c_0\n$$\n2. At the boundary $x=L$, the slab is impermeable. This means there is zero net transport across the boundary, so the diffusive flux is zero: $J_x(L) = 0$. Using Fick's first law:\n$$\nJ_x(L) = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}\\Bigg|_{x=L} = 0\n$$\nSince $D$ is a non-zero constant, this implies that the gradient of the concentration is zero at this boundary:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dx}\\Bigg|_{x=L} = 0\n$$\nWe now solve the boundary value problem.
