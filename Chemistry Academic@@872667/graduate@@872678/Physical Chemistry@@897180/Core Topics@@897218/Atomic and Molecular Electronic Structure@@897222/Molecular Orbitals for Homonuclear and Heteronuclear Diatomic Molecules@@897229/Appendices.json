It is a standard and well-posed formulation for determining the molecular orbital energies of the hydrogen molecular ion, $\\text{H}_{2}^{+}$, within the LCAO-MO approximation. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and free of ambiguity. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe theoretical framework is the variational method applied to a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The molecular orbital wavefunction, $\\psi$, is approximated as a linear combination of the normalized $1s$ atomic orbitals, $\\chi_{A}$ and $\\chi_{B}$, centered on nuclei $A$ and $B$, respectively:\n$$ \\psi = c_{A}\\chi_{A} + c_{B}\\chi_{B} $$\nThe application of the variational principle leads to the secular equations, which can be expressed in matrix form as the generalized eigenvalue problem $\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{c}=E\\,\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{c}$. Here, $\\mathbf{c}$ is the column vector of coefficients $(c_{A}, c_{B})^{T}$.\n\nFirst, we must construct the Hamiltonian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ and the overlap matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ in the basis $\\{\\chi_{A}, \\chi_{B}\\}$. The matrix elements are defined as integrals over the basis functions.\n\nThe Hamiltonian matrix elements are:\n$H_{11} = \\langle\\chi_{A}|\\hat{H}|\\chi_{A}\\rangle = \\alpha(R)$\n$H_{22} = \\langle\\chi_{B}|\\hat{H}|\\chi_{B}\\rangle = \\alpha(R)$ (by symmetry)\n$H_{12} = \\langle\\chi_{A}|\\hat{H}|\\chi_{B}\\rangle = \\beta(R)$\n$H_{21} = \\langle\\chi_{B}|\\hat{H}|\\chi_{A}\\rangle = \\beta(R)$ (since $\\hat{H}$ is a Hermitian operator)\nThus, the Hamiltonian matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{H} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha(R)  \\beta(R) \\\\ \\beta(R)  \\alpha(R) \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe overlap matrix elements are:\n$S_{11} = \\langle\\chi_{A}|\\chi_{A}\\rangle = 1$ (since $\\chi_{A}$ is normalized)\n$S_{22} = \\langle\\chi_{B}|\\chi_{B}\\rangle = 1$ (since $\\chi_{B}$ is normalized)\n$S_{12} = \\langle\\chi_{A}|\\chi_{B}\\rangle = S(R)$\n$S_{21} = \\langle\\chi_{B}|\\chi_{A}\\rangle = S(R)$ (by definition of the inner product)\nThus, the overlap matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  S(R) \\\\ S(R)  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nFor non-trivial solutions for the coefficients $c_{A}$ and $c_{B}$, the secular determinant must be equal to zero:\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{H} - E\\mathbf{S}) = 0 $$\nSubstituting the matrices gives:\n$$ \\det\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha(R)  \\beta(R) \\\\ \\beta(R)  \\alpha(R) \\end{pmatrix} - E \\begin{pmatrix} 1  S(R) \\\\ S(R)  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha(R) - E  \\beta(R) - ES(R) \\\\ \\beta(R) - ES(R)  \\alpha(R) - E \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\nFor notational simplicity, we will temporarily drop the explicit dependence on $R$.\n$$ (\\alpha - E)^{2} - (\\beta - ES)^{2} = 0 $$\nThis equation is a difference of squares, which factors into:\n$$ [(\\alpha - E) - (\\beta - ES)][(\\alpha - E) + (\\beta - ES)] = 0 $$\nThis yields two separate linear equations for the energy $E$:\n\n1.  $(\\alpha - E) + (\\beta - ES) = 0$\n    $\\alpha + \\beta = E + ES$\n    $\\alpha + \\beta = E(1 + S)$\n    $$ E = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{1 + S} $$\n\n2.  $(\\alpha - E) - (\\beta - ES) = 0$\n    $\\alpha - \\beta = E - ES$\n    $\\alpha - \\beta = E(1 - S)$\n    $$ E = \\frac{\\alpha - \\beta}{1 - S} $$\n\nWe must now assign these energies to the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals. The Coulomb integral $\\alpha(R)$ is the approximate energy of an electron in a single atomic orbital under the influence of both nuclei, and it is negative. The resonance integral $\\beta(R)$, which accounts for the electron density in the internuclear region, is also negative; it is the dominant term responsible for the formation of a covalent bond. The overlap integral $S(R)$ is positive for $R  \\infty$.\n\nThe bonding orbital, by definition, has a lower energy (is more stable) than the constituent atomic orbitals. The energy expression $E = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{1 + S}$ involves the sum of two negative numbers in the numerator, making it more negative than $\\alpha$ alone. This energy decrease signifies stabilization. Therefore, this is the energy of the bonding molecular orbital, $E_{+}(R)$.\n\nThe antibonding orbital has a higher energy (is less stable) than the atomic orbitals. The energy expression $E = \\frac{\\alpha - \\beta}{1 - S}$ has a numerator $\\alpha - \\beta$ that is less negative than $\\alpha$ (since $\\beta  0$, $-\\beta  0$). This energy increase signifies destabilization. Therefore, this is the energy of the antibonding molecular orbital, $E_{-}(R)$.\n\nIncluding the explicit dependence on the internuclear distance $R$, the two energy levels are:\n$$ E_{+}(R) = \\frac{\\alpha(R) + \\beta(R)}{1 + S(R)} \\quad (\\text{bonding}) $$\n$$ E_{-}(R) = \\frac{\\alpha(R) - \\beta(R)}{1 - S(R)} \\quad (\\text{antibonding}) $$\n\nNext, we justify the evolution of these energies with internuclear distance $R$.\nIn the limit of large separation, $R \\to \\infty$:\nThe atomic orbitals cease to overlap, so the overlap integral $S(R) \\to 0$.\nWith no overlap, there is no electron density shared between the nuclei, so the resonance interaction vanishes: $\\beta(R) \\to 0$.\nThe Coulomb integral $\\alpha(R)$ approaches the energy of an electron in an isolated hydrogen $1s$ orbital, $E_{1s}$, as the influence of the distant second nucleus becomes negligible: $\\alpha(R) \\to E_{1s}$.\nSubstituting these limits into the energy expressions:\n$$ E_{+}(R \\to \\infty) \\to \\frac{E_{1s} + 0}{1 + 0} = E_{1s} $$\n$$ E_{-}(R \\to \\infty) \\to \\frac{E_{1s} - 0}{1 - 0} = E_{1s} $$\nThus, at infinite separation, both molecular orbitals degenerate to the energy of the constituent atomic orbitals, which is physically correct.\n\nAs $R$ decreases from infinity:\nThe overlap $S(R)$ increases from $0$. The resonance integral $\\beta(R)$ becomes progressively more negative as the electron density in the favorable internuclear region increases. The Coulomb integral $\\alpha(R)$ also becomes slightly more negative than $E_{1s}$ due to the attraction of the electron to the second nucleus.\nFor the bonding energy $E_{+}(R) = \\frac{\\alpha(R) + \\beta(R)}{1 + S(R)}$, the numerator $\\alpha(R) + \\beta(R)$ becomes significantly more negative due to the contribution of $\\beta(R)$. This leads to a substantial decrease in energy, forming a potential well and enabling a stable chemical bond at an equilibrium distance $R_{e}$.\nFor the antibonding energy $E_{-}(R) = \\frac{\\alpha(R) - \\beta(R)}{1 - S(R)}$, the term $-\\beta(R)$ is positive and grows as $R$ decreases. This positive term dominates, causing $E_{-}(R)$ to rise steeply in energy above the separated atom limit. The destabilization of the antibonding orbital, proportional to $|\\beta|/(1-S)$, is greater in magnitude than the stabilization of the bonding orbital, proportional to $|\\beta|/(1+S)$, because $S(R) > 0$. This repulsive state does not lead to bonding.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\alpha(R) + \\beta(R)}{1 + S(R)}  \\frac{\\alpha(R) - \\beta(R)}{1 - S(R)} \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2652715"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the foundational principles, we now apply the LCAO-MO framework to a real multi-electron system, the diboron molecule ($\\text{B}_2$).

It is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds using the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals–Molecular Orbital (LCAO-MO) framework. The molecule under consideration is $\\text{B}_2$. Each Boron atom has an atomic number $Z=5$ and a valence electron configuration of $2s^2 2p^1$, contributing $3$ valence electrons. The diatomic molecule $\\text{B}_2$ therefore has a total of $6$ valence electrons to be placed in the molecular orbitals.\n\nThe problem specifies the energy ordering of the molecular orbitals for light homonuclear diatomics where $s$-$p$ mixing is significant:\n$$ \\sigma_{2s}  \\sigma_{2s}^{\\ast}  \\pi_{2p_x}=\\pi_{2p_y}  \\sigma_{2p_z}  \\pi_{2p_x}^{\\ast}=\\pi_{2p_y}^{\\ast}  \\sigma_{2p_z}^{\\ast} $$\nWe will fill the first few of these orbitals with the $6$ available valence electrons, following the Aufbau principle, the Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule.\n\n1.  The first $2$ electrons fill the lowest energy MO, the $\\sigma_{2s}$ bonding orbital, to give $(\\sigma_{2s})^2$.\n2.  The next $2$ electrons fill the $\\sigma_{2s}^{\\ast}$ antibonding orbital, to give $(\\sigma_{2s}^{\\ast})^2$.\n3.  We have used $4$ electrons. The remaining $2$ electrons must be placed in the next available orbitals. These are the degenerate $\\pi_{2p_x}$ and $\\pi_{2p_y}$ bonding orbitals.\n4.  According to Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity, when filling degenerate orbitals, electrons are placed singly in each orbital with parallel spins before any orbital is doubly occupied. Therefore, one electron occupies the $\\pi_{2p_x}$ orbital, and the second electron occupies the $\\pi_{2p_y}$ orbital. Their spins are parallel.\n\nThe resulting ground-state electron configuration for $\\text{B}_2$ is:\n$$ (\\sigma_{2s})^2 (\\sigma_{2s}^{\\ast})^2 (\\pi_{2p_x})^1 (\\pi_{2p_y})^1 $$\nFrom this configuration, it is clear that there are two unpaired electrons, one in the $\\pi_{2p_x}$ orbital and one in the $\\pi_{2p_y}$ orbital. The number of unpaired electrons is $n=2$. The presence of unpaired electrons means that $\\text{B}_2$ is paramagnetic.\n\nNext, we calculate the bond order. The bond order (BO) is defined as half the difference between the number of electrons in bonding orbitals ($N_b$) and the number of electrons in antibonding orbitals ($N_a$).\n$$ \\text{BO} = \\frac{1}{2} (N_b - N_a) $$\nFrom the electron configuration:\n- The bonding orbitals are $\\sigma_{2s}$, $\\pi_{2p_x}$, and $\\pi_{2p_y}$. The number of electrons in these orbitals is $N_b = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4$.\n- The antibonding orbital populated is $\\sigma_{2s}^{\\ast}$. The number of electrons in this orbital is $N_a = 2$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula for bond order:\n$$ \\text{BO} = \\frac{1}{2} (4 - 2) = \\frac{1}{2} (2) = 1 $$\nThe bond order of $\\text{B}_2$ is $1$, which corresponds to a single bond.\n\nNow, we compute the spin-only magnetic moment, $\\mu_S$. For light molecules where the orbital angular momentum contribution is quenched, the magnetic moment is well-approximated by the spin-only formula:\n$$ \\mu_S = \\sqrt{n(n+2)} \\, \\mu_B $$\nwhere $n$ is the number of unpaired electrons and $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. As determined previously, $n=2$.\nSubstituting this value:\n$$ \\mu_S = \\sqrt{2(2+2)} \\, \\mu_B = \\sqrt{2(4)} \\, \\mu_B = \\sqrt{8} \\, \\mu_B = 2\\sqrt{2} \\, \\mu_B $$\nThe value of the spin-only magnetic moment is $2\\sqrt{2}$ in units of Bohr magnetons.\n\nFinally, we contrast the MO prediction with a simple Valence Bond (VB) theory picture. In a simple VB model, bonding arises from the overlap of atomic orbitals containing one electron each. The valence configuration of a Boron atom is $2s^2 2p^1$. The $2s$ orbital is filled and its electrons are a lone pair. This leaves the singly occupied $2p$ orbital on each atom available for bonding. The overlap of the two half-filled $2p$ orbitals (one from each B atom) would form a single covalent bond (a $\\sigma$ bond). In this process, the two electrons are paired up within the bond. All other valence electrons (the two $2s^2$ pairs) are also paired. Consequently, the simple VB model predicts that the $\\text{B}_2$ molecule has no unpaired electrons ($n=0$) and should therefore be diamagnetic. This prediction is in direct contradiction with experimental evidence, which shows that $\\text{B}_2$ is paramagnetic. The MO theory, by delocalizing electrons across the entire molecule and correctly applying Hund's rule to degenerate $\\pi$ orbitals, naturally and correctly predicts the paramagnetism of $\\text{B}_2$ with two unpaired electrons. The success of MO theory in this case is a classic example of its superiority over simple VB theory for describing the electronic structure of certain molecules.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1  2\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2652665"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice delves into the quantitative analysis of electron distribution in heteronuclear diatomic molecules, where unequal sharing of electrons is key.

The net charge on an atom is defined as the difference between its nuclear charge and its gross electronic population: $q_X = Z_X - G_X$.\nUsing the given valence nuclear charges $Z_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1$ and $Z_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1$:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{A}} = Z_{\\mathrm{A}} - G_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1 - \\frac{4 + \\sqrt{7}}{9} = \\frac{9 - (4 + \\sqrt{7})}{9} = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{7}}{9} $$\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{B}} = Z_{\\mathrm{B}} - G_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1 - \\frac{14 - \\sqrt{7}}{9} = \\frac{9 - (14 - \\sqrt{7})}{9} = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{7}}{9} $$\nThe sum of the net charges is $q_{\\mathrm{A}} + q_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{7}}{9} + \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{7}}{9} = 0$, as required for a neutral molecule.\n\nThe required quantities have been determined in exact analytical form.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{4 + \\sqrt{7}}{9}  \\frac{14 - \\sqrt{7}}{9}  \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{7}}{9}  \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{7}}{9}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2652682"}]}
