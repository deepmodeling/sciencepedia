This is because subtracting one identical row from another results in a row of zeros, and the determinant of a matrix with a zero row is necessarily zero.\n\nTherefore, for the matrix $M$:\n$$\n\\det(M) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for the wavefunction $\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})$:\n$$\n\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3!}} \\times 0 = 0\n$$\nThis result is valid for any choice of coordinates $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, and $x_{3}$. The wavefunction is identically zero throughout the entire configuration space.\n\nThe second task is to explain why this configuration is not physically allowable.\nThe physical interpretation of a wavefunction $\\Psi$ is given by the Born rule, which states that the probability density of finding the particles at coordinates $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}$ is proportional to $|\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})|^2$. For our result, the probability density is:\n$$\n|\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})|^2 = |0|^2 = 0\n$$\nThis means the probability of finding the three-electron system in any configuration is zero. The total probability of finding the particles somewhere in the configuration space is the integral of the probability density over all possible coordinates:\n$$\n\\int |\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})|^2 dx_{1}dx_{2}dx_{3} = \\int 0 \\, dx_{1}dx_{2}dx_{3} = 0\n$$\nHowever, for a wavefunction to represent a physical state, it must be normalizable to unity. That is, the total probability of finding the particles must be $1$. Since our wavefunction yields a total probability of $0$, it cannot be normalized and thus does not describe any physical state. A system of particles must exist somewhere.\n\nThis result is a direct mathematical consequence of a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics: the Pauli Exclusion Principle. The principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.

The Slater determinant is constructed specifically to enforce the antisymmetry requirement for a multi-fermion wavefunction, which means the wavefunction must change its sign upon the exchange of the coordinates of any two fermions. The Pauli Exclusion Principle is a direct consequence of this antisymmetry requirement. If one attempts to construct an antisymmetric wavefunction from a set of single-particle states that are not all distinct, the resulting wavefunction is identically zero.\n\nIn essence, the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics forbids such a state from existing from the very outset, by making its wavefunction vanish.

In a CI calculation, the total wavefunction is expanded as a linear combination of non-zero configuration state functions (CSFs), which are typically Slater determinants or linear combinations thereof. A configuration that produces a null state vector cannot be part of this basis.\n\nThis result is a direct consequence of a fundamental property of determinants: if two columns (or rows) are identical, the determinant is zero. In the context of Slater determinants, this mathematically enforces the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers. Here, attempting to place both electrons in the same spin-orbital $\\phi_{2s\\alpha}$ (which has quantum numbers $n=2$, $l=0$, $m_l=0$, and $m_s=+1/2$) violates this principle, and the formalism correctly yields a null state.

It must be excluded because it places both electrons in the same spin-orbital $\\phi_{2s\\alpha}$, making the corresponding Slater determinant identically zero (two identical columns), which is precisely the content of the Pauli exclusion principle: no two electrons can occupy the same spin-orbital.\nThis statement is perfectly aligned with the derivation above. It correctly identifies that both electrons are in the same spin-orbital, correctly states that this makes the Slater determinant zero due to identical columns, and correctly identifies this as the manifestation of the Pauli exclusion principle.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. It must be excluded because Brillouin’s theorem forbids single excitations from a closed-shell reference, and this double excitation contains a single-excitation component, so it vanishes by that theorem.\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. Brillouin's theorem states that the Hamiltonian matrix element between the Hartree-Fock reference and any singly excited determinant is zero, $\\langle \\Phi_0 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_i^a \\rangle = 0$. It does not forbid the inclusion of single excitations in the CI expansion, nor does it imply that the single excitation determinants themselves are zero. Furthermore, the excitation in question is a double excitation, not a single one. This option completely misrepresents and misapplies Brillouin's theorem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. It can be included; it represents a valid high-spin triplet configuration that will correlate and lower the energy, since CI allows parallel-spin double occupancy of one spatial orbital.\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. As derived, the configuration cannot be included because its Slater determinant is zero. It does not represent a valid physical state, either singlet or triplet. The claim that CI allows \"parallel-spin double occupancy of one spatial orbital\" is a direct contradiction of the Pauli exclusion principle. A valid triplet state must have an antisymmetric spatial part if the spin part is symmetric, which implies different spatial orbitals for the two electrons (e.g., $\\phi_{1s}(1)\\phi_{2s}(2) - \\phi_{1s}(2)\\phi_{2s}(1)$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. It must be excluded only to avoid linear dependence among configuration state functions; the Pauli principle is already satisfied here because the electrons occupy different spin functions.\nThis statement contains a gross factual error. The configuration is $|2s\\,\\alpha, 2s\\,\\alpha\\rangle$. The spin function for both electrons is $\\alpha$; they are not different. Therefore, the Pauli principle is explicitly violated, not satisfied. The reason for exclusion is not merely to deal with linear dependence among valid states; the state itself is not valid—it is a null vector.
