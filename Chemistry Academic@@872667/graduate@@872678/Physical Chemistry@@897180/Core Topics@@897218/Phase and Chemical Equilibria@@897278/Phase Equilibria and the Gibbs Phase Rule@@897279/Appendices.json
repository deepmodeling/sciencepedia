The general number of degrees of freedom is:\n$$\nF = 2 - 2 + 2 = 2\n$$\nThis means that to specify the thermodynamic state of the two-phase system, two independent intensive variables (e.g., $T$ and $P$) must be fixed. The problem statement specifies fixed temperature and pressure. Fixing these two variables uses up both degrees of freedom. The number of remaining degrees of freedom is $F' = F - 2 = 0$.\nA system with zero degrees of freedom is called invariant. This means that once $T$ and $P$ are specified (to be within the two-phase coexistence region), all other intensive properties of the system are fixed. This includes the compositions of the coexisting phases, $x_{\\alpha}$ and $x_{\\beta}$. Our calculation confirms this: for a given $g(x)$ (which is defined by the fixed $T$ and $P$), the pair $(x_{\\alpha}, x_{\\beta})$ is uniquely determined by the geometric condition of the common tangent, which itself provides a unique solution.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{4}  \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2506894"}, {"introduction": "While the Gibbs phase rule allows us to determine the intensive properties of phases at equilibrium, such as their composition, it does not reveal their relative quantities.

The overall alloy composition $x_{B}^{0}=0.25$ lies between the solid and liquid compositions ($0.023  0.25  0.344$), which is the condition for the existence of a two-phase equilibrium between the $\\alpha$ and liquid phases. The setup is self-consistent.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution is now constructed from the required first principles.\n\nFirst, we consider the degrees of freedom in the system using the Gibbs phase rule. For a system with $C$ components and $P$ phases, the number of degrees of freedom is $F=C-P+2$. In this binary system, the number of components is $C=2$. The pressure is fixed at $p=1\\ \\mathrm{bar}$, which removes one degree of freedom. This leads to the condensed phase rule, $F' = C - P + 1$. In the two-phase region where liquid and solid $\\alpha$ coexist, the number of phases is $P=2$. Therefore, the number of degrees of freedom is $F' = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1$. This signifies that if one intensive variable (e.g., temperature $T$) is specified, all other intensive properties of the system at equilibrium, including the compositions of the coexisting phases, are uniquely determined.\n\nThe fundamental condition for phase equilibrium at a given temperature $T$ and pressure $p$ is the equality of the chemical potentials of each component in all coexisting phases. For the equilibrium between the liquid ($L$) phase and the solid ($\\alpha$) phase, this requires:\n$$ \\mu_{A}^{L}(T, x_{B}^{L}) = \\mu_{A}^{\\alpha}(T, x_{B}^{\\alpha}) $$\n$$ \\mu_{B}^{L}(T, x_{B}^{L}) = \\mu_{B}^{\\alpha}(T, x_{B}^{\\alpha}) $$\nwhere $\\mu_{i}^{\\phi}$ is the chemical potential of component $i$ in phase $\\phi$. Solving this system of two equations for the two unknown compositions, $x_{B}^{L}$ and $x_{B}^{\\alpha}$, at a given $T$ yields unique values. The problem statement provides the empirical result of this fundamental condition through the given linear functions $x_{B}^{L}(T)$ and $x_{B}^{\\alpha}(T)$. These functions define the liquidus and solidus lines on the phase diagram. We use these given relations to find the compositions of the two phases at the specified temperature $T=930\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe temperature difference from the eutectic is $\\Delta T = T - T_{E} = 930\\ \\mathrm{K} - 900\\ \\mathrm{K} = 30\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\nThe mole fraction of component $B$ in the liquid phase at this temperature is:\n$$ x_{B}^{L}(930\\ \\mathrm{K}) = x_{B}^{E} - m_{L}(T-T_{E}) = 0.35 - (2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1})(30\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 0.35 - 0.006 = 0.344 $$\nThe mole fraction of component $B$ in the $\\alpha$-solid phase at this temperature is:\n$$ x_{B}^{\\alpha}(930\\ \\mathrm{K}) = x_{B}^{\\alpha,E} + m_{\\alpha}(T-T_{E}) = 0.02 + (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1})(30\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 0.02 + 0.003 = 0.023 $$\nAs established, the overall composition $x_{B}^{0}=0.25$ lies between these two values, confirming the system is in the $L+\\alpha$ two-phase field.\n\nNext, we use the principle of mass conservation to determine the relative amounts of the two phases. Let $f^{\\alpha}$ and $f^{L}$ be the mole fractions of the $\\alpha$ and liquid phases in the mixture, respectively. By definition, the sum of the mole fractions of the phases must be unity:\n$$ f^{\\alpha} + f^{L} = 1 $$\nThe overall mole fraction of component $B$, $x_{B}^{0}$, is the weighted average of the mole fractions of $B$ in each phase, where the weights are the phase fractions. This constitutes the mass (or mole) balance for component $B$:\n$$ x_{B}^{0} = f^{\\alpha}x_{B}^{\\alpha} + f^{L}x_{B}^{L} $$\nThis expression does not assume any shortcut formulas. To find the mole fraction of the $\\alpha$ phase, $f^{\\alpha}$, we eliminate $f^{L}$ using the relation $f^{L} = 1 - f^{\\alpha}$.\n$$ x_{B}^{0} = f^{\\alpha}x_{B}^{\\alpha} + (1 - f^{\\alpha})x_{B}^{L} $$\nRearranging to solve for $f^{\\alpha}$:\n$$ x_{B}^{0} = f^{\\alpha}x_{B}^{\\alpha} + x_{B}^{L} - f^{\\alpha}x_{B}^{L} $$\n$$ x_{B}^{0} - x_{B}^{L} = f^{\\alpha}(x_{B}^{\\alpha} - x_{B}^{L}) $$\n$$ f^{\\alpha} = \\frac{x_{B}^{0} - x_{B}^{L}}{x_{B}^{\\alpha} - x_{B}^{L}} $$\nThis can be written in the more familiar form of the lever rule:\n$$ f^{\\alpha} = \\frac{x_{B}^{L} - x_{B}^{0}}{x_{B}^{L} - x_{B}^{\\alpha}} $$\nThis derivation explicitly shows how the phase fractions are determined by mass balance once the phase compositions are uniquely fixed by temperature.\n\nWe now substitute the numerical values for the compositions at $T=930\\ \\mathrm{K}$: $x_{B}^{L} = 0.344$, $x_{B}^{\\alpha} = 0.023$, and the overall composition $x_{B}^{0} = 0.25$.\n$$ f^{\\alpha} = \\frac{0.344 - 0.25}{0.344 - 0.023} = \\frac{0.094}{0.321} $$\n$$ f^{\\alpha} \\approx 0.29283489... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required, we obtain $f^{\\alpha} = 0.2928$.\n\nRegarding the solidification pathway upon slow cooling from $T=930\\ \\mathrm{K}$ toward $T_{E}$, the system evolves while maintaining equilibrium. As the temperature decreases, the equilibrium compositions of the liquid and solid phases change according to the given functions. The liquid composition $x_{B}^{L}(T)$ increases toward the eutectic composition $x_{B}^{E}=0.35$. The solid composition $x_{B}^{\\alpha}(T)$ decreases toward $x_{B}^{\\alpha,E}=0.02$. Consequently, as the alloy cools, more of the $\\alpha$ phase precipitates from the liquid. The fraction of solid, $f^{\\alpha}$, continuously increases. At any temperature $T$ in the interval $(T_{E}, 930\\ \\mathrm{K}]$, the compositions of the phases and their relative amounts are determined by the tie-line at that temperature and the lever rule. This process continues until the temperature reaches $T_{E}$.

A convenient way to combine these is to use the condition $\\sum y_i - \\sum x_i = 0$.\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - x_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{K_i z_i}{1 + \\beta(K_i - 1)} - \\frac{z_i}{1 + \\beta(K_i - 1)} \\right) = 0$$\nFactoring out the common terms gives:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{z_i (K_i - 1)}{1 + \\beta(K_i - 1)} = 0$$\nThis is the Rachford-Rice equation, a single nonlinear equation for the unknown vapor fraction $\\beta$. Let us define the function $f(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{z_i (K_i - 1)}{1 + \\beta(K_i - 1)}$. We seek the root of $f(\\beta) = 0$.\n\nA physically meaningful solution for a two-phase system must satisfy $0  \\beta  1$. The existence and uniqueness of such a solution can be analyzed by examining the properties of $f(\\beta)$.\nFirst, evaluate $f(\\beta)$ at the boundaries of the interval $[0, 1]$.\nAt $\\beta = 0$ (bubble point of the feed), the equation gives:\n$$f(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} z_i(K_i - 1) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} K_i z_i - 1$$\nFor a vapor phase to begin to form ($\\beta > 0$), the feed must be a two-phase mixture or a saturated liquid at its bubble point, not a subcooled liquid. This requires $\\sum K_i z_i \\ge 1$, which implies $f(0) \\ge 0$. For a distinct two-phase region, we require the strict inequality $f(0) > 0$.\n\nAt $\\beta = 1$ (dew point of the feed), the equation gives:\n$$f(1) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{z_i(K_i - 1)}{1 + (K_i - 1)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{z_i(K_i - 1)}{K_i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (z_i - \\frac{z_i}{K_i}) = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{z_i}{K_i}$$\nFor a liquid phase to exist ($\\beta  1$), the feed cannot be a superheated vapor. This requires $\\sum z_i/K_i \\ge 1$, which implies $f(1) \\le 0$. For a distinct two-phase region, we require the strict inequality $f(1)  0$.\n\nThe derivative of $f(\\beta)$ with respect to $\\beta$ is:\n$$f'(\\beta) = \\frac{d}{d\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{z_i (K_i - 1)}{1 + \\beta(K_i - 1)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} -z_i \\frac{(K_i - 1)^2}{[1 + \\beta(K_i - 1)]^2}$$\nSince $z_i > 0$ and all squared terms are non-negative, $f'(\\beta)  0$ for any mixture where at least one $K_i \\neq 1$. Thus, $f(\\beta)$ is a strictly monotonically decreasing function of $\\beta$ on the interval $(0, 1)$.\nTherefore, a unique, physically meaningful solution $0  \\beta  1$ exists if and only if $f(0) > 0$ and $f(1)  0$. These conditions are equivalent to $\\sum K_i z_i > 1$ and $\\sum z_i/K_i > 1$.\n\nFinally, we compute $\\beta$ for the given ternary system:\n$N=3$, $\\{z_1, z_2, z_3\\} = \\{0.5, 0.3, 0.2\\}$, and $\\{K_1, K_2, K_3\\} = \\{2.0, 0.8, 0.5\\}$.\nFirst, check the existence conditions:\nBubble point check: $\\sum z_i K_i = (0.5)(2.0) + (0.3)(0.8) + (0.2)(0.5) = 1.0 + 0.24 + 0.10 = 1.34$. Since $1.34 > 1$, the condition $f(0) > 0$ is satisfied.\nDew point check: $\\sum z_i/K_i = 0.5/2.0 + 0.3/0.8 + 0.2/0.5 = 0.25 + 0.375 + 0.4 = 1.025$. Since $1.025 > 1$, the condition $f(1)  0$ is satisfied.\nA unique root for $\\beta$ must exist in $(0, 1)$.\n\nThe Rachford-Rice equation for this case is:\n$$f(\\beta) = \\frac{0.5(2.0-1)}{1+\\beta(2.0-1)} + \\frac{0.3(0.8-1)}{1+\\beta(0.8-1)} + \\frac{0.2(0.5-1)}{1+\\beta(0.5-1)} = 0$$\n$$f(\\beta) = \\frac{0.5}{1+\\beta} + \\frac{-0.06}{1-0.2\\beta} + \\frac{-0.1}{1-0.5\\beta} = 0$$\nTo solve this, we can clear the denominators. This results in a polynomial equation for $\\beta$. For $N=3$, this is a quadratic equation.\n$$0.5(1-0.2\\beta)(1-0.5\\beta) - 0.06(1+\\beta)(1-0.5\\beta) - 0.1(1+\\beta)(1-0.2\\beta) = 0$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$0.5(1 - 0.7\\beta + 0.1\\beta^2) - 0.06(1 + 0.5\\beta - 0.5\\beta^2) - 0.1(1 + 0.8\\beta - 0.2\\beta^2) = 0$$\n$$(0.5 - 0.35\\beta + 0.05\\beta^2) - (0.06 + 0.03\\beta - 0.03\\beta^2) - (0.1 + 0.08\\beta - 0.02\\beta^2) = 0$$\nCollecting terms by powers of $\\beta$:\n$$(0.05 + 0.03 + 0.02)\\beta^2 + (-0.35 - 0.03 - 0.08)\\beta + (0.5 - 0.06 - 0.1) = 0$$\n$$0.1\\beta^2 - 0.46\\beta + 0.34 = 0$$\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $\\beta$ using the quadratic formula $\\beta = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{0.46 \\pm \\sqrt{(-0.46)^2 - 4(0.1)(0.34)}}{2(0.1)}$$\n$$\\beta = \\frac{0.46 \\pm \\sqrt{0.2116 - 0.136}}{0.2}$$\n$$\\beta = \\frac{0.46 \\pm \\sqrt{0.0756}}{0.2}$$\n$$\\beta = \\frac{0.46 \\pm 0.2749545...}{0.2}$$\nThis yields two mathematical roots:\n$$\\beta_1 = \\frac{0.46 + 0.2749545}{0.2} = \\frac{0.7349545}{0.2} \\approx 3.6748$$\n$$\\beta_2 = \\frac{0.46 - 0.2749545}{0.2} = \\frac{0.1850455}{0.2} \\approx 0.9252$$\nThe only physically valid solution is the one that lies in the interval $(0, 1)$. Therefore, we must choose $\\beta_2$.\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $\\beta = 0.9252$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9252}\n$$", "id": "2659880"}]}
