Assume that activities can be used in the rate law and, for the numerical evaluation, that activity coefficients are constant so that activities are proportional to molar concentrations. Water is in large excess, so its activity is effectively constant.

All necessary data and conditions for a unique solution are provided, and no contradictions or ambiguities are present. The problem is a standard exercise in acid-base catalysis and is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe task requires the derivation of rate laws for specific and general acid catalysis and the subsequent calculation of the general acid catalytic coefficient, $k_{HA}$.\n\nFirst, we address the case of Specific Acid Catalysis (SAC). The mechanism is given as:\n$$A + \\text{H}_{3}\\text{O}^{+} \\stackrel{K_{eq}}{\\rightleftharpoons} AH^{+} \\quad \\text{(fast pre-equilibrium)}$$\n$$AH^{+} \\stackrel{k_{1}}{\\longrightarrow} \\text{products} \\quad \\text{(slow, rate-determining)}$$\nThe rate of the reaction, $v$, is determined by the slow step:\n$$v = k_{1} a_{AH^{+}}$$\nwhere $k_{1}$ is the rate constant of the unimolecular cleavage and $a_{AH^{+}}$ is the activity of the protonated substrate.\nFrom the fast pre-equilibrium step, the equilibrium constant, which I will denote as $K_{AH^{+}}$ to be precise about the protonated species, is:\n$$K_{AH^{+}} = \\frac{a_{AH^{+}}}{a_{A} a_{\\text{H}^{+}}}$$\nHere, $a_{A}$ is the activity of the substrate and $a_{\\text{H}^{+}}$ is the activity of the hydronium ion.\nSince the pre-equilibrium is established rapidly, we can express the activity of the reactive intermediate $AH^{+}$ in terms of the stable reactants:\n$$a_{AH^{+}} = K_{AH^{+}} a_{A} a_{\\text{H}^{+}}$$\nSubstituting this expression into the rate equation gives:\n$$v = k_{1} K_{AH^{+}} a_{A} a_{\\text{H}^{+}}$$\nThe rate of disappearance of substrate $A$ is defined as $v = - \\frac{d[A]}{dt}$. The problem states that activities are proportional to molar concentrations, so we can write the rate law in terms of the substrate's activity, which is standard when activity coefficients are assumed constant. The overall rate law is:\n$$v = (k_{1} K_{AH^{+}} a_{\\text{H}^{+}}) a_{A}$$\nThis is pseudo-first-order with respect to the substrate $A$. The observed pseudo-first-order rate constant, $k_{\\text{obs}}$, is the collection of terms multiplying $a_{A}$:\n$$k_{\\text{obs}} = k_{1} K_{AH^{+}} a_{\\text{H}^{+}}$$\nWe define the specific acid catalysis coefficient, $k_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$, as the product of the rate constant of the slow step and the equilibrium constant of protonation:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = k_{1} K_{AH^{+}}$$\nThus, the rate law for SAC is:\n$$k_{\\text{obs}} = k_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$$\nThis expression correctly predicts that a plot of $k_{\\text{obs}}$ versus $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ is linear and passes through the origin, with a slope equal to $k_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$. The problem provides this slope from the experiment without buffer: $S_{0} = k_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = 1.20 \\ \\mathrm{M^{-1} s^{-1}}$.\n\nNext, we consider the composite mechanism including General Acid Catalysis (GAC) by a Brønsted acid $HA$. This introduces a parallel pathway that is first-order in both substrate $A$ and catalyst $HA$. The rate of this pathway, $v_{GAC}$, is:\n$$v_{GAC} = k_{HA} a_{A} a_{HA}$$\nwhere $k_{HA}$ is the general acid catalytic coefficient.\nThe total rate of reaction, $v_{total}$, is the sum of the rates of all parallel pathways. Since general base catalysis is stated to be negligible, the total rate is the sum of the SAC and GAC pathways:\n$$v_{total} = v_{SAC} + v_{GAC} = k_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} a_{A} + k_{HA} a_{HA} a_{A}$$\nFactoring out the substrate activity $a_{A}$:\n$$v_{total} = (k_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} + k_{HA} a_{HA}) a_{A}$$\nThe composite pseudo-first-order rate constant, $k_{\\text{obs}}$, for the full system is therefore:\n$$k_{\\text{obs}} = k_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} + k_{HA} a_{HA}$$\nThis is the required expression. Our goal is to calculate $k_{HA}$. Rearranging the equation yields:\n$$k_{HA} = \\frac{k_{\\text{obs}} - k_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}}{a_{HA}}$$\nTo proceed, we must determine the value of $a_{HA}$ under the given experimental conditions.

The rate of disappearance of the substrate $S$ is followed.\n$$ -\\frac{d[S]}{dt} = k_1[S][\\text{Im}] - k_{-1}[S\\text{-Im}^+][P^-] $$\nWhen a competing nucleophile, methanol ($\\text{MeOH}$), is present, it provides an additional pathway for the decomposition of the intermediate:\n$$ S\\text{-Im}^+ + \\text{MeOH} \\xrightarrow{k_3} \\text{Methyl Acetate} + \\text{Im} $$\nThe steady-state concentration of the intermediate is:\n$$ [S\\text{-Im}^+] = \\frac{k_1[S][\\text{Im}]}{k_{-1}[P^-] + k_2[\\text{H}_2\\text{O}] + k_3[\\text{MeOH}]} $$\nThe rate of substrate consumption is the observed rate:\n$$ \\text{Rate} = k_{\\text{obs}}[S] = \\frac{k_1(k_2[\\text{H}_2\\text{O}] + k_3[\\text{MeOH}])}{k_{-1}[P^-] + k_2[\\text{H}_2\\text{O}] + k_3[\\text{MeOH}]}[S][\\text{Im}] + \\text{uncatalyzed terms} $$\nThe slope of the $k_{\\text{obs}}$ versus $[\\text{Im}]$ plot is:\n$$ m = k_1 \\frac{k_2[\\text{H}_2\\text{O}] + k_3[\\text{MeOH}]}{k_{-1}[P^-] + k_2[\\text{H}_2\\text{O}] + k_3[\\text{MeOH}]} $$\nIf the initial attack of imidazole is reversible ($k_{-1} > 0$), the addition of methanol provides a \"trap\" for the intermediate. By consuming $S\\text{-Im}^+$, it prevents the reverse reaction to starting materials. This increases the overall efficiency of the catalytic cycle for substrate consumption. Mathematically, as $[\\text{MeOH}]$ increases, the term $k_3[\\text{MeOH}]$ is added to both numerator and denominator. The value of $m$ will increase from its value at $[\\text{MeOH}]=0$, $m_0 = \\frac{k_1 k_2[\\text{H}_2\\text{O}]}{k_{-1}[P^-] + k_2[\\text{H}_2\\text{O}]}$, towards a limiting value of $k_1$. Therefore, a significant increase in the slope $m$ upon addition of methanol is a diagnostic sign of nucleophilic catalysis.\n\nLet us now examine the intercept, $b$. This represents the uncatalyzed solvolysis rate, $k_{\\text{uncat}}$, which is the sum of pathways involving water, hydronium, and hydroxide at a fixed pH.\n$$ b = k_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} + k_{\\text{H}^+}[\\text{H}^+] + k_{\\text{OH}^-}[\\text{OH}^-] $$\nWhen methanol is added, it can act as a nucleophile itself in the uncatalyzed reaction, leading to methanolysis.\n$$ S + \\text{MeOH} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{MeOH}}} \\text{Methyl Acetate} + P^- $$\nThis opens a new parallel pathway, so the intercept should increase:\n$$ b_{\\text{MeOH}} = b_0 + k_{\\text{MeOH}}[\\text{MeOH}] $$\nAn increase in the intercept confirms that methanol is competent as a nucleophile under these conditions.\n\n**Interpretation of the data:**\n- Intercept: $b_0=1.5\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ increases to $b_{\\text{MeOH}}=3.1\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ with $1.00\\,\\text{M}$ $\\text{MeOH}$. This significant increase confirms that methanol acts as a nucleophile, participating in the solvolysis reaction.\n- Slope: $m_0=12.0\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ changes to $m_{\\text{MeOH}}=12.1\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ with $1.00\\,\\text{M}$ $\\text{MeOH}$. This change is minuscule ($<1\\%$) and on par with the small solvent effect observed with acetonitrile ($m_{\\text{MeCN}}=11.7\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$). There is no significant increase in the slope.\n\nThe absence of a significant increase in the slope $m$ in the presence of a competent competing nucleophile ($\\text{MeOH}$) allows us to rule out the nucleophilic catalysis mechanism. The data are consistent only with the general base catalysis mechanism.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. Add methanol at high concentration and compare the slope of $k_{\\text{obs}}$ versus $[\\text{Im}]$ with and without methanol. If the slope is unchanged within experimental error while the intercept changes, conclude that the buffer effect arises from general acid-base catalysis and not buffer nucleophilic participation; the observed data support this conclusion.\nThis option correctly describes the experimental strategy. It correctly identifies the diagnostic test: the effect of the competing nucleophile on the slope of the buffer-catalyzed rate term. It correctly interprets the expected outcome: an unchanged slope signifies GBC, ruling out NC. It correctly notes the significance of the changing intercept (confirming methanol's nucleophilicity). Finally, it correctly states that the provided experimental data fits this interpretation. **Correct.**\n\nB. Add a non-nucleophilic electrolyte to raise the ionic strength by $1.00\\,\\text{M}$, observe a decrease in the slope of $k_{\\text{obs}}$ versus $[\\text{Im}]$, and conclude that buffer nucleophilic participation has been suppressed by competition, thereby excluding nucleophilic catalysis.\nThis describes an experiment on kinetic salt effects, not one using a competing nucleophile. An inert electrolyte does not \"compete\" in a nucleophilic sense. The interpretation is confused and the experiment is not the one described in the problem setup. **Incorrect.**\n\nC. Add sodium azide at $1.00\\,\\text{M}$; if $k_{\\text{obs}}$ increases at all $[\\text{Im}]$, conclude that buffer nucleophilic participation is excluded because azide accelerates the reaction by a different pathway.\nSodium azide is a potent nucleophile and would indeed increase $k_{\\text{obs}}$ by providing a new reaction channel. However, this observation does not exclude nucleophilic catalysis by imidazole. In fact, if the NC mechanism were active, azide would also trap the intermediate, likely increasing the slope $m$. The logic that a new pathway excludes the old one is fallacious. This strategy does not provide a clean distinction. **Incorrect.**\n\nD. Replace imidazole with a buffer of similar acid dissociation constant but much lower nucleophilicity; if the slopes of $k_{\\text{obs}}$ versus buffer base concentration are similar for the two buffers, conclude that nucleophilic participation is excluded by the inert nucleophile strategy using methanol at $1.00\\,\\text{M}$.\nThis option describes a valid alternative experiment (a Brønsted-type analysis) but conflates it with the competing nucleophile experiment. The conclusion from the buffer-replacement experiment cannot be attributed to the \"inert nucleophile strategy using methanol.\" The question specifically asks for the interpretation of the methanol experiment. This option fails to do so correctly. **Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the underlying kinetics, Option A provides the only correct description of the experimental strategy, its theoretical basis, and its interpretation in light of the provided data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2668138"}]}
