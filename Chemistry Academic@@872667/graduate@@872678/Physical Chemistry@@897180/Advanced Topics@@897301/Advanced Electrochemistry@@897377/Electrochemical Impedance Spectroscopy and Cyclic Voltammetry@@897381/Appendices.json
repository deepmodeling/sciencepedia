The uncompensated resistance drops voltage proportional to the total current, shifting the anodic peak to more positive and the cathodic peak to more negative potentials; the correct post-correction is $E_{p}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{p}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - i_{\\mathrm{tot}} R_{\\mathrm{u}}$ with $i_{\\mathrm{tot}} = i_{\\mathrm{F}} + i_{\\mathrm{C}}$, where $i_{\\mathrm{C}} = C_{\\mathrm{dl}}\\,v$ is included with its sign.

The true potential at the working electrode interface, $E_{\\mathrm{WE}}$, differs from the potential measured by the instrument, $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, due to the ohmic potential drop across the solution resistance between the reference electrode tip and the working electrode surface. This relationship is given by:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{WE}}(t) = E_{\\mathrm{meas}}(t) - i(t)\\,R_{\\mathrm{u}}$$\nThe current, $i(t)$, that causes this drop is the **total** current flowing through the cell.

The uncompensated resistance drops voltage proportional to the total current, shifting the anodic peak to more positive and the cathodic peak to more negative potentials; the correct post-correction is $E_{p}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{p}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - i_{\\mathrm{tot}} R_{\\mathrm{u}}$ with $i_{\\mathrm{tot}} = i_{\\mathrm{F}} + i_{\\mathrm{C}}$, where $i_{\\mathrm{C}} = C_{\\mathrm{dl}}\\,v$ is included with its sign.

The correction formula, $E_{p}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{p}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - i_{\\mathrm{tot}} R_{\\mathrm{u}}$, is the correct strategy, as it uses the total current.\n- **Quantitative Analysis**: The option's final calculated value for the formal potential, $E^{0'} \\approx 0.259\\,\\mathrm{V}$, matches our derived value. However, the intermediate values for the corrected peak potentials ($0.290\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $0.228\\,\\mathrm{V}$) are incorrect. Our correct calculations yield $0.296\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $0.222\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The error in the option's intermediate calculation appears to arise from an incorrect manipulation of currents, specifically by taking the measured total current and adding the capacitive current again before calculating the ohmic drop. This is a physical absurdity. Nevertheless, this error is constructed such that it cancels out perfectly when the potentials are averaged.\n- **Verdict**: Despite the flawed numerical demonstration for the intermediate steps, this option presents the only fundamentally correct physical principle and the correct overall strategy. The core of the statement is sound, and the final answer is correct. Thus, it is the best available option. **Correct**.\n\n**B. The uncompensated resistance only drops faradaic current because capacitive current does not traverse the solution resistance; therefore, use $E_{p}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{p}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - i_{\\mathrm{F}} R_{\\mathrm{u}}$ and ignore $i_{\\mathrm{C}}$ in the correction. This yields $E^{0'} \\approx 0.259\\,\\mathrm{V}$.**\n\n- **Principle**: The premise \"capacitive current does not traverse the solution resistance\" is fundamentally false. The charging of the double layer requires charge to flow from the external circuit through the electrolyte, and thus through $R_{\\mathrm{u}}$. The proposed strategy of using only the faradaic current for correction is therefore incorrect.\n- **Quantitative Analysis**: First, we must find the faradaic current components. The capacitive current is $i_{\\mathrm{C}} = C_{\\mathrm{dl}}\\,v = (1.50 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{F})(0.10\\,\\mathrm{V\\,s^{-1}}) = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{A} = 15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$. So, $i_{\\mathrm{C,a}} = +15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$ and $i_{\\mathrm{C,c}} = -15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$. The faradaic currents at the total current peaks are $i_{p,a,\\mathrm{F}} = i_{p,a} - i_{\\mathrm{C,a}} = 160\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A} - 15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A} = 145\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$ and $i_{p,c,\\mathrm{F}} = i_{p,c} - i_{\\mathrm{C,c}} = -155\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A} - (-15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}) = -140\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$. Using these in the flawed strategy: $E_{p,a}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = 0.360 - (145\\times 10^{-6})(400) = 0.302\\,\\mathrm{V}$; $E_{p,c}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = 0.160 - (-140\\times 10^{-6})(400) = 0.216\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Averaging these gives $E^{0'} = (0.302+0.216)/2 = 0.259\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The result for $E^{0'}$ is coincidentally correct because the error introduced by omitting the symmetric capacitive currents from the ohmic drop calculation cancels upon averaging. However, a correct result from a fallacious method is not a correct answer.\n- **Verdict**: The underlying physical principle is incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The apparent shift in $E_{p}$ is dominated by capacitive background; subtract a background CV to remove $i_{\\mathrm{C}}$ from the current axis and compute the midpoint of the measured peaks without any potential-axis correction. This yields $E^{0'} \\approx (0.360\\,\\mathrm{V} + 0.160\\,\\mathrm{V})/2 \\approx 0.260\\,\\mathrm{V}$.**\n\n- **Principle**: This option proposes to ignore the ohmic drop correction entirely. With $R_{\\mathrm{u}}=400\\,\\Omega$ and currents over $150\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$, the ohmic drop is substantial (over $60\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) and cannot be ignored. The statement that the shift is \"dominated\" by capacitive background is misleading; the IR drop is the primary source of potential shift.\n- **Quantitative Analysis**: The proposed calculation is simply the midpoint of the uncorrected, measured peak potentials: $(0.360\\,\\mathrm{V} + 0.160\\,\\mathrm{V})/2 = 0.260\\,\\mathrm{V}$. This value is close to the correct answer only because the magnitudes of the anodic and cathodic peak currents are coincidentally close, making the ohmic drops nearly symmetric. However, they are not identical, and this method is fundamentally flawed.\n- **Verdict**: The strategy is physically unsound as it neglects a major, known systematic error. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Positive-feedback compensation of $R_{\\mathrm{u}}$ at $100\\%$ (using the EIS value) during CV eliminates both ohmic and capacitive distortions of $E_{p}$ across scan rates, so one may take $E^{0'}$ as the uncorrected midpoint $0.260\\,\\mathrm{V}$ in all cases without further analysis.**\n\n- **Principle**: This option discusses an experimental procedure (positive-feedback IR compensation) that was not part of the experiment described in the problem. The problem is one of data analysis for an uncompensated measurement. The suggestion to use the uncorrected midpoint is therefore irrelevant and inappropriate for the given data set. Furthermore, even perfect feedback does not \"eliminate\" capacitive distortions, although it mitigates some of their effects on the potential waveform.\n- **Quantitative Analysis**: The option advocates for the same incorrect calculation as in C, taking the uncorrected midpoint.\n- **Verdict**: This option is irrelevant to the problem posed, which is about analyzing existing data, not about hypothetical alternative experiments. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2635612"}, {"introduction": "Interpreting complex impedance spectra requires confidence in the data's validity, as artifacts can easily be mistaken for physical phenomena.

Since $Z''_{\\mathrm{sub,KK}} \\approx Z''_{\\mathrm{sub}}$, the K-K test confirms that the observed positive imaginary part is not noise or a simple artifact but is a required feature dictated by the behavior of the real part of the impedance. This supports the conclusion that the inductive feature belongs to the underlying physical process of the electrochemical interface.\n\nBoth arguments are sound and support the conclusion. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\n**B. Any appearance of an inductive signature at low frequency necessarily imposes $Z'(0) - Z'(\\infty) = 0$ by Kramers–Kronig symmetry; since the measured difference is approximately $40\\,\\Omega$, the inductive loop must be an artifact.**\n\nThis statement invokes a supposed consequence of the Kramers–Kronig relations. The relevant K-K relation is:\n$$ Z'(0) - Z'(\\infty) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{Z''(x)}{x} dx $$\nThe quantity $Z'(0) - Z'(\\infty)$ is the total polarization resistance of the system. For a passive electrochemical cell, this must be non-negative, $Z'(0) - Z'(\\infty) \\ge 0$. The integral is over the entire frequency spectrum. An \"inductive signature\" means $Z''(x)  0$ in some frequency range, while a \"capacitive signature\" means $Z''(x)  0$ in another range. There is no fundamental law or \"K-K symmetry\" that forces this integral to be zero if there is any region where $Z''(x)  0$. In the given problem, $Z'(0) - Z'(\\infty) \\approx 50.0\\,\\Omega - 10.0\\,\\Omega = 40.0\\,\\Omega$. This positive value is physically meaningful and perfectly consistent with the K-K relations, regardless of the presence of an inductive loop. The premise of this option is factually incorrect. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n**C. The subtracted Kramers–Kronig test is inconclusive in this case because any series inductance can always be absorbed into the K–K integral and reproduce arbitrary low-frequency $Z''  0$; thus one cannot distinguish between lead inductance and a true interfacial inductive loop.**\n\nThis claim misunderstands the nature of K-K analysis. An ideal series inductance contributes an imaginary impedance term $Z''_{L}(\\omega) = \\omega L$, which is a linear function of frequency and has no corresponding real part ($Z'_{L}(\\omega)=0$). A genuine interfacial relaxation process, whether capacitive or inductive, has both real and imaginary parts whose frequency dependencies are intrinsically linked and non-trivial; for instance, the inductive loop appears in a limited frequency range and $Z'' \\to 0$ at both low and high frequency limits of the process. The K-K integral transform is sensitive to these specific frequency dependencies. It is not possible to \"absorb\" an arbitrary function into the integral; the K-K relations are unique. The fact that the K-K test on the *subtracted* data is passed successfully is strong evidence *against* the artifact hypothesis, making the test highly conclusive, not inconclusive. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\n**D. If the observed loop were solely due to lead inductance, then after subtracting $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$ and $j\\omega L_{\\mathrm{fit}}$ the Kramers–Kronig transform of the measured $Z'_{\\mathrm{sub}}(\\omega)$ would predict $Z''_{\\mathrm{sub}}(\\omega) \\approx 0$ at low frequency; the observed nonzero $Z''_{\\mathrm{sub,KK}}$ therefore indicates an internal relaxation with inductive character.**\n\nThis option presents a rigorous logical argument. Let us assume the null hypothesis: the low-frequency inductive loop is solely an artifact of the series lead inductance, which is well-approximated by $L_{\\mathrm{fit}}$. Then the measured impedance would be $Z(\\omega) = R_{\\mathrm{s}} + Z_{\\mathrm{if}}(\\omega) + j\\omega L_{\\mathrm{fit}}$, where the true interfacial impedance, $Z_{\\mathrm{if}}(\\omega)$, has no low-frequency inductive character (i.e., we expect $Z''_{\\mathrm{if}}(\\omega) \\le 0$).\nThe subtracted impedance is calculated as $Z_{\\mathrm{sub}}(\\omega) = Z(\\omega) - R_{\\mathrm{s}} - j\\omega L_{\\mathrm{fit}}$.\nSubstituting our hypothesized form for $Z(\\omega)$, we get $Z_{\\mathrm{sub}}(\\omega) = Z_{\\mathrm{if}}(\\omega)$.\nThus, under the null hypothesis, the subtracted impedance is identical to the true interfacial impedance.\nWhen we perform the K-K test, we take the real part, $Z'_{\\mathrm{sub}}(\\omega) = Z'_{\\mathrm{if}}(\\omega)$, and use it to predict the imaginary part, which should be $Z''_{\\mathrm{if}}(\\omega)$.\nAccording to our hypothesis, $Z''_{\\mathrm{if}}(\\omega)$ has no low-frequency inductive loop. Given the system is capacitive at mid-frequencies, we would predict $Z''_{\\mathrm{sub,KK}}(\\omega) \\le 0$ in the low-frequency regime.\nHowever, the problem states that the K-K test predicts $Z''_{\\mathrm{sub,KK}}(10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) \\approx +1.9\\,\\Omega$. This result directly contradicts the prediction from our null hypothesis. Therefore, the null hypothesis must be false. The observed inductive loop cannot be solely due to the lead inductance. The reasoning is sound and the conclusion is justified. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\n**E. Replacing the electrolyte with a blocking one (no faradaic current) would increase the influence of lead inductance at low frequency, thereby confirming an instrumental origin of the loop.**\n\nA \"blocking\" electrolyte implies that the faradaic charge transfer resistance becomes effectively infinite ($R_{\\mathrm{ct}} \\to \\infty$). At low frequencies, the interface behaves primarily as a capacitor (the double-layer capacitance, $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$). The impedance of this interface, $Z_{\\mathrm{if}} \\approx 1/(j\\omega C_{\\mathrm{dl}})$, becomes very large in magnitude as $\\omega \\to 0$. The total measured impedance is $Z(\\omega) = R_{\\mathrm{s}} + j\\omega L_{\\mathrm{lead}} + Z_{\\mathrm{if}}(\\omega)$. At low frequencies, the contribution from the lead inductance, $|j\\omega L_{\\mathrm{lead}}| = \\omega L_{\\mathrm{lead}}$, becomes extremely small. The relative influence of the lead inductance is the ratio of its impedance to the total impedance, which would be vanishingly small as $|Z_{\\mathrm{if}}(\\omega)|$ dominates and grows very large. The influence of series inductance is most pronounced at *high* frequencies, where the interfacial impedance is typically small. This option claims the opposite. Therefore, option E is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, statements A and D are correct and scientifically justified by the provided information. They represent two complementary arguments leading to the same conclusion: the observed low-frequency inductive loop is a genuine feature of the electrochemical interface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2635660"}]}
