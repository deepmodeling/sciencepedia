First, the general relationship between absorbance change and reaction extent will be derived. Second, this framework will be applied to a specific consecutive first-order reaction scheme to find the time-dependent absorbance and a particular amplitude coefficient.\n\nPart 1: Proportionality of Absorbance Change and Reaction Extent\n\nThe Beer-Lambert law states that the absorbance $A$ of a solution is given by the sum of the contributions from all absorbing species:\n$$A(t) = l \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i} c_{i}(t)$$\nwhere $l$ is the optical path length, $\\epsilon_{i}$ is the molar absorptivity of species $\\mathrm{X}_{i}$, and $c_{i}(t)$ is its concentration at time $t$.\n\nThe extent of reaction, $\\xi(t)$, defines the change in the amount of substance for each species. For a homogeneous reaction in a constant volume system, it is more convenient to use the extent of reaction per unit volume, which has units of concentration. We will use the symbol $\\xi(t)$ for this quantity, consistent with common practice in chemical kinetics. The change in concentration of any species $\\mathrm{X}_{i}$ from its initial state ($t=0$) is then related to $\\xi(t)$ by its stoichiometric coefficient $\\nu_{i}$:\n$$\\Delta c_{i}(t) = c_{i}(t) - c_{i}(0) = \\nu_{i} \\xi(t)$$\nThe convention is that $\\nu_{i}$ is negative for reactants and positive for products.\n\nThe change in absorbance, $\\Delta A(t)$, is the difference between the absorbance at time $t$ and the initial absorbance at $t=0$:\n$$\\Delta A(t) = A(t) - A(0) = l \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i} c_{i}(t) - l \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i} c_{i}(0)$$\n$$\\Delta A(t) = l \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i} (c_{i}(t) - c_{i}(0)) = l \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i} \\Delta c_{i}(t)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta c_{i}(t)$ in terms of the reaction extent:\n$$\\Delta A(t) = l \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i} (\\nu_{i} \\xi(t)) = \\left( l \\sum_{i} \\nu_{i} \\epsilon_{i} \\right) \\xi(t)$$\nThe problem states that only species $\\mathrm{X}_{j}$ has a non-zero molar absorptivity, i.e., $\\epsilon_{j} \\neq 0$ and $\\epsilon_{i} = 0$ for all $i \\neq j$. The sum therefore simplifies to a single term:\n$$\\sum_{i} \\nu_{i} \\epsilon_{i} = \\nu_{j} \\epsilon_{j}$$\nThus, the relationship between the absorbance change and the reaction extent is:\n$$\\Delta A(t) = (l \\nu_{j} \\epsilon_{j}) \\xi(t)$$\nThis shows a direct proportionality between $\\Delta A(t)$ and $\\xi(t)$. The proportionality constant is $l \\nu_{j} \\epsilon_{j}$.\n\nPart 2: Consecutive First-Order Reaction\n\nThe reaction scheme is $\\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k_{1}} \\mathrm{B} \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} \\mathrm{C}$. The corresponding system of rate equations is:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\mathrm{A}]}{dt} = -k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[\\mathrm{B}]}{dt} = k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] - k_{2}[\\mathrm{B}] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[\\mathrm{C}]}{dt} = k_{2}[\\mathrm{B}] $$\nWith the initial conditions $[\\mathrm{A}](0) = [\\mathrm{A}]_{0}$, $[\\mathrm{B}](0)=0$, and $[\\mathrm{C}](0)=0$.\n\nFirst, we solve for $[\\mathrm{A}](t)$. The first equation is a simple first-order decay:\n$$ \\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}^{[\\mathrm{A}](t)} \\frac{d[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} = -k_{1} \\int_{0}^{t} dt' \\implies [\\mathrm{A}](t) = [\\mathrm{A}]_{0} \\exp(-k_{1}t) $$\nNext, we substitute this result into the rate equation for species $\\mathrm{B}$:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\mathrm{B}]}{dt} + k_{2}[\\mathrm{B}] = k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0} \\exp(-k_{1}t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We solve it using an integrating factor $I(t) = \\exp(\\int k_{2} dt) = \\exp(k_{2}t)$. Multiplying by $I(t)$ yields:\n$$ \\exp(k_{2}t)\\frac{d[\\mathrm{B}]}{dt} + k_{2}\\exp(k_{2}t)[\\mathrm{B}] = k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0} \\exp(-k_{1}t)\\exp(k_{2}t) $$\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( [\\mathrm{B}]\\exp(k_{2}t) \\right) = k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0} \\exp((k_{2}-k_{1})t) $$\nIntegrating from $t'=0$ to $t'=t$, assuming $k_{1} \\neq k_{2}$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{B}](t)\\exp(k_{2}t) - [\\mathrm{B}](0)\\exp(0) = \\int_{0}^{t} k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0} \\exp((k_{2}-k_{1})t') dt' $$\n$$ [\\mathrm{B}](t)\\exp(k_{2}t) = \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}{k_{2}-k_{1}} \\left[ \\exp((k_{2}-k_{1})t') \\right]_{0}^{t} = \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}{k_{2}-k_{1}} (\\exp((k_{2}-k_{1})t) - 1) $$\nUsing $[\\mathrm{B}](0)=0$ and multiplying by $\\exp(-k_{2}t)$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{B}](t) = \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}{k_{2}-k_{1}} (\\exp(-k_{1}t) - \\exp(-k_{2}t)) $$\nThe problem states that only species $\\mathrm{B}$ absorbs light. The absorbance is $A(t) = \\epsilon_{B} l [\\mathrm{B}](t)$. The initial absorbance is $A(0) = \\epsilon_{B} l [\\mathrm{B}](0) = 0$.\nThe absorbance change is $\\Delta A(t) = A(t) - A(0) = A(t)$:\n$$ \\Delta A(t) = \\epsilon_{B} l \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}{k_{2}-k_{1}} (\\exp(-k_{1}t) - \\exp(-k_{2}t)) $$\nThis expression is a sum of two decaying exponentials.

Since $k_{1} > k_{2}$, the fast rate is $k_{\\text{fast}} = k_{1}$ and the slow rate is $k_{\\text{slow}} = k_{2}$.\nWe match the derived expression to the canonical form $\\Delta A(t) = \\alpha_{\\text{fast}} \\exp(-k_{\\text{fast}} t) + \\alpha_{\\text{slow}} \\exp(-k_{\\text{slow}} t)$.\nThe amplitude coefficient of the fast term, $\\exp(-k_{1}t)$, is:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{fast}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{B} l k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}{k_{2}-k_{1}} $$\nThe amplitude coefficient of the slow term, $\\exp(-k_{2}t)$, is:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{slow}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{B} l k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}{k_{1}-k_{2}} $$\nNote that since $[\\mathrm{B}](0)=0$, we must have $\\Delta A(0)=0$. Evaluating our expression at $t=0$ gives $\\Delta A(0) = \\alpha_{\\text{fast}} + \\alpha_{\\text{slow}}$, which indeed equals zero, confirming the consistency of our coefficients.\n\nFinal Calculation of $\\alpha_{\\text{slow}}$\n\nWe are required to compute the value of $\\alpha_{\\text{slow}}$ using the provided parameters:\n$k_{1} = 2.50 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{2} = 1.00 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$[\\mathrm{A}]_{0} = 4.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{M}$\n$\\epsilon_{B} = 1.20 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\text{M}^{-1} \\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$\n$l = 1.00 \\ \\text{cm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\alpha_{\\text{slow}}$:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{slow}} = \\frac{(1.20 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\text{M}^{-1} \\text{cm}^{-1})(1.00 \\ \\text{cm})(2.50 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\text{s}^{-1})(4.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{M})}{(2.50 \\times 10^{5} - 1.00 \\times 10^{5}) \\ \\text{s}^{-1}} $$\nFirst, evaluate the numerator:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (1.20 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (1.00) \\times (2.50 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (4.00 \\times 10^{-6}) $$\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (1.20 \\times 2.50 \\times 4.00) \\times (10^{4} \\times 10^{5} \\times 10^{-6}) = 12.0 \\times 10^{3} = 1.20 \\times 10^{4} $$\nNext, evaluate the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = 2.50 \\times 10^{5} - 1.00 \\times 10^{5} = 1.50 \\times 10^{5} $$\nNow, compute the ratio:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{slow}} = \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^{4}}{1.50 \\times 10^{5}} = \\frac{1.20}{1.50} \\times 10^{-1} = 0.800 \\times 10^{-1} = 0.0800 $$\nThe calculation results in an exact value of $0.08$.

We can express one concentration in terms of the other, for instance, $c_{B}(t) = c_{T} - c_{A}(t)$. Substituting this into the absorbance equation gives:\n$$A(\\lambda, t) = \\ell \\left( \\varepsilon_{A}(\\lambda)c_{A}(t) + \\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda)(c_{T} - c_{A}(t)) \\right)$$\nRearranging the terms to separate the constant and time-dependent parts yields:\n$$A(\\lambda, t) = \\ell \\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda)c_{T} + \\ell c_{A}(t) \\left( \\varepsilon_{A}(\\lambda) - \\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda) \\right)$$\nThis equation explicitly shows the transient absorbance in terms of a single composition variable, $c_{A}(t)$, and the difference of molar absorptivities, $\\varepsilon_{A}(\\lambda) - \\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda)$, as requested.\n\nAn isosbestic wavelength, denoted $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}$, is defined as a wavelength where the absorbance is independent of the composition of the mixture, and thus independent of time during the reaction. For $A(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}, t)$ to be constant, the term that depends on the time-varying concentration $c_{A}(t)$ must vanish. Since $\\ell > 0$ and $c_A(t)$ is not constant (unless the system is at equilibrium), this requires that the coefficient of $c_{A}(t)$ be zero. This provides the algebraic condition on the molar absorptivities:\n$$\\varepsilon_{A}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}) - \\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}) = 0$$\nwhich is equivalent to:\n$$\\varepsilon_{A}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}) = \\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}})$$\nAt such a wavelength, the absorbance simplifies to:\n$$A(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}, t) = \\ell \\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}})c_{T} = \\ell \\varepsilon_{A}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}})c_{T}$$\nThe absorbance is constant and directly proportional to the total concentration $c_{T}$.\n\nThe simplification for kinetic interpretation is twofold. First, the observation of a constant absorbance at $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ provides a crucial check that the total concentration $c_{T}$ is indeed conserved and that the interconversion $A \\leftrightarrow B$ is the only process occurring that involves spectrally active species in this window. Any deviation would indicate side reactions or degradation. Second, at any other wavelength $\\lambda \\neq \\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}$, the change in absorbance from equilibrium, $\\Delta A(\\lambda, t) = A(\\lambda, t) - A_{eq}(\\lambda)$, is directly proportional to the change in concentration from its equilibrium value, $\\Delta c_{A}(t) = c_{A}(t) - c_{A,eq}$:\n$$\\Delta A(\\lambda, t) = \\ell (\\Delta c_{A}(t)) (\\varepsilon_{A}(\\lambda) - \\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda))$$\nThe time evolution of the absorbance signal, $\\frac{d A}{dt}$, is therefore directly proportional to the rate of reaction, $\\frac{d c_{A}}{dt}$. This allows for the direct determination of kinetic parameters from the absorbance trace without needing to deconvolve the contributions from both species.\n\n(b) Generalization to an n-component system.\n\nFor an $n$-component system, the concentration vector is $\\mathbf{c}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and the absorbance is $A(\\lambda,t) = \\ell\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\lambda) \\cdot \\mathbf{c}(t)$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\lambda) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the vector of molar absorptivities. The system is constrained by $m$ independent conservation laws, expressed in matrix form as $\\mathbf{L}\\,\\mathbf{c}(t) = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{L} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is a constant vector.\n\nAn isosbestic wavelength $\\lambda$ is one where $A(\\lambda, t)$ is invariant for all allowed compositions. Let $\\mathbf{c}_1$ and $\\mathbf{c}_2$ be any two concentration vectors that satisfy the conservation laws, i.e., $\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{c}_1 = \\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{c}_2 = \\mathbf{b}$. For the absorbance to be the same, we must have $A(\\lambda, t_1) = A(\\lambda, t_2)$, which implies:\n$$\\ell\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\lambda) \\cdot \\mathbf{c}_1 = \\ell\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\lambda) \\cdot \\mathbf{c}_2$$\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\lambda) \\cdot (\\mathbf{c}_1 - \\mathbf{c}_2) = 0$$\nThe vector $\\Delta\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{c}_1 - \\mathbf{c}_2$ represents an arbitrary displacement vector within the affine subspace of allowed compositions. Such a vector must satisfy $\\mathbf{L}(\\Delta\\mathbf{c}) = \\mathbf{L}(\\mathbf{c}_1 - \\mathbf{c}_2) = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{c}_1 - \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{c}_2 = \\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{0}$. Therefore, any allowed change in concentration $\\Delta\\mathbf{c}$ must lie in the null space of the matrix $\\mathbf{L}$, denoted $N(\\mathbf{L})$. This is the stoichiometric subspace.\n\nThe condition $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\lambda) \\cdot \\Delta\\mathbf{c} = 0$ must hold for all vectors $\\Delta\\mathbf{c} \\in N(\\mathbf{L})$. By definition, this means the vector $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\lambda)$ must be orthogonal to the entire subspace $N(\\mathbf{L})$. In linear algebra, the subspace orthogonal to the null space of a matrix is the row space of that matrix, $(N(\\mathbf{L}))^{\\perp} = \\text{Row}(\\mathbf{L})$.\n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for $\\lambda$ to be an isosbestic wavelength is that the molar absorptivity vector $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\lambda)$ must belong to the row space of the conservation law matrix $\\mathbf{L}$. This means $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\lambda)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows of $\\mathbf{L}$.\n\nTo specialize this to the two-species case in part (a), we have $n=2$ species, so $\\mathbf{c} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_{A} \\\\ c_{B} \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\lambda) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_{A}(\\lambda) \\\\ \\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda) \\end{pmatrix}$. There is $m=1$ conservation law, $c_{A} + c_{B} = c_{T}$. This corresponds to a matrix $\\mathbf{L} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b} = c_T$.\nThe null space $N(\\mathbf{L})$ consists of all vectors $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_A \\\\ v_B \\end{pmatrix}$ such that $\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{v} = v_A + v_B = 0$. This space is spanned by the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which represents the stoichiometry of the interconversion.\nThe condition that $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\lambda)$ is orthogonal to $N(\\mathbf{L})$ is:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\lambda) \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = 0$$\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_{A}(\\lambda) \\\\ \\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda) \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\varepsilon_{A}(\\lambda) - \\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda) = 0$$\nThis yields $\\varepsilon_{A}(\\lambda) = \\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda)$, which is precisely the condition derived in part (a).\n\n(c) Analytic expression for the isosbestic wavelength.\n\nGiven are the molar absorptivity spectra for species $A$ and $B$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{A}(\\lambda) = \\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda - \\lambda_{A})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda) = r\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda - \\lambda_{B})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe isosbestic wavelength $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ is found by setting $\\varepsilon_{A}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}) = \\varepsilon_{B}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}})$:\n$$\\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}} - \\lambda_{A})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) = r\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}} - \\lambda_{B})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)$$\nSince $\\varepsilon_{0} > 0$, we can divide both sides by $\\varepsilon_{0}$:\n$$\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}} - \\lambda_{A})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) = r\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}} - \\lambda_{B})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides is permissible as both arguments are positive ($r > 0$):\n$$-\\frac{(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}} - \\lambda_{A})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}} = \\ln(r) - \\frac{(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}} - \\lambda_{B})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}$$\nMultiply the entire equation by $-2\\sigma^{2}$ (since $\\sigma > 0$):\n$$(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}} - \\lambda_{A})^{2} = -2\\sigma^{2}\\ln(r) + (\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}} - \\lambda_{B})^{2}$$\nNow, we expand the squared binomials:\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}^{2} - 2\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\lambda_{A} + \\lambda_{A}^{2} = -2\\sigma^{2}\\ln(r) + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}^{2} - 2\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\lambda_{B} + \\lambda_{B}^{2}$$\nThe $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}^{2}$ terms on both sides cancel. We are left with a linear equation for $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}$. Let us collect all terms containing $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ on one side:\n$$2\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\lambda_{B} - 2\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\lambda_{A} = \\lambda_{B}^{2} - \\lambda_{A}^{2} - 2\\sigma^{2}\\ln(r)$$\nFactor out $2\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ on the left side and rewrite the right side:\n$$2\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}(\\lambda_{B} - \\lambda_{A}) = (\\lambda_{B} - \\lambda_{A})(\\lambda_{B} + \\lambda_{A}) - 2\\sigma^{2}\\ln(r)$$\nTo solve for $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}}$, we must assume $\\lambda_{A} \\neq \\lambda_{B}$. If $\\lambda_{A} = \\lambda_{B}$, the equation simplifies to $0 = -2\\sigma^{2}\\ln(r)$, which implies $\\ln(r)=0$ or $r=1$. In that degenerate case, the spectra are identical, and every wavelength is an isosbestic point. For a unique isosbestic point as implied by the problem, we must have $\\lambda_{A} \\neq \\lambda_{B}$. Dividing by $2(\\lambda_{B} - \\lambda_{A})$ yields:\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}} = \\frac{(\\lambda_{B} - \\lambda_{A})(\\lambda_{B} + \\lambda_{A})}{2(\\lambda_{B} - \\lambda_{A})} - \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}\\ln(r)}{2(\\lambda_{B} - \\lambda_{A})}$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{A} + \\lambda_{B}}{2} - \\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\ln(r)}{\\lambda_{B} - \\lambda_{A}}$$\nThis can be written equivalently as:\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{iso}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{A} + \\lambda_{B}}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}\\ln(r)}{\\lambda_{A} - \\lambda_{B}}$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the unique isosbestic wavelength.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\lambda_{A} + \\lambda_{B}}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma^{2} \\ln(r)}{\\lambda_{A} - \\lambda_{B}}}$$", "id": "2640180"}]}
