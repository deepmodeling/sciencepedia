I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nWe will use the density matrix formalism in the rotating frame to model the system's evolution. The state of the system is described by the density matrix $\\rho$ in the basis $\\{|g \\rangle, |e \\rangle\\}$. The initial state at time $t=0$ is $\\rho(0) = |g \\rangle\\langle g|$, which in matrix form is:\n$$\n\\rho(0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, the matrix representation is $\\rho = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{gg} & \\rho_{ge} \\\\ \\rho_{eg} & \\rho_{ee} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**1. Evolution under the first pulse:**\nThe Hamiltonian in the rotating frame under the RWA is given by:\n$$\nH_{\\text{pulse}} = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\Delta & \\Omega_{R} \\\\ \\Omega_{R} & \\Delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe evolution operator for a pulse of duration $\\tau$ is $U(\\tau) = \\exp(-i H_{\\text{pulse}} \\tau / \\hbar)$. Let the effective Rabi frequency be $\\Omega_{\\text{eff}} = \\sqrt{\\Omega_{R}^2 + \\Delta^2}$ and the pulse area be $\\theta = \\Omega_{\\text{eff}} \\tau$. The unitary operator is:\n$$\nU(\\tau) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) + i\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) & i\\frac{\\Omega_{R}}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\\\ i\\frac{\\Omega_{R}}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) & \\cos(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) - i\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet's denote the matrix elements as $U_{gg}$, $U_{ge}$, $U_{eg}$, $U_{ee}$. After the first pulse, the density matrix $\\rho_1$ is $\\rho_1 = U(\\tau) \\rho(0) U(\\tau)^{\\dagger}$. The elements of $\\rho_1$ are:\n$$\n\\rho_{ee,1} = (U \\rho(0) U^\\dagger)_{ee} = U_{eg} \\rho_{gg}(0) U_{eg}^{*} = |U_{eg}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\Omega_R}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\right)^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{gg,1} = |U_{gg}|^2 = \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\right)^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = |U_{ee}|^2\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{eg,1} = U_{eg} U_{gg}^{*} = \\left(i\\frac{\\Omega_{R}}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) - i\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nAnd $\\rho_{ge,1} = \\rho_{eg,1}^{*}$.\n\n**2. Free evolution for time $\\Delta t$:**\nDuring the free evolution, $\\Omega_R = 0$. The evolution of the coherences is governed by the detuning $\\Delta$ and the pure dephasing rate $\\gamma_{\\phi}$.

Evolution under the second pulse:**\nThe second pulse is identical to the first. The final density matrix $\\rho_f$ is $\\rho_f = U(\\tau) \\rho_2 U(\\tau)^{\\dagger}$. We are interested in the final excited-state population $P_e = (\\rho_f)_{ee}$.\n$$\nP_e = (U \\rho_2 U^\\dagger)_{ee} = |U_{eg}|^2 \\rho_{gg,2} + |U_{ee}|^2 \\rho_{ee,2} + 2 \\text{Re}\\left[ U_{ee} U_{eg}^{*} \\rho_{eg,2} \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\rho_2$ elements:\n$$\nP_e = |U_{eg}|^2 \\rho_{gg,1} + |U_{ee}|^2 \\rho_{ee,1} + 2 \\text{Re}\\left[ U_{ee} U_{eg}^{*} \\rho_{eg,1} \\exp(i\\Delta \\Delta t - \\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\right]\n$$\nUsing $\\rho_{gg,1}=|U_{ee}|^2$, $\\rho_{ee,1}=|U_{eg}|^2$, and $\\rho_{eg,1}=U_{eg}U_{gg}^*=U_{eg}U_{ee}$:\n$$\nP_e = |U_{eg}|^2 |U_{ee}|^2 + |U_{ee}|^2 |U_{eg}|^2 + 2 \\text{Re}\\left[ U_{ee} U_{eg}^{*} (U_{eg} U_{ee}) \\exp(i\\Delta \\Delta t - \\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nP_e = 2|U_{eg}|^2 |U_{ee}|^2 + 2 \\text{Re}\\left[ (U_{ee})^2 |U_{eg}|^2 \\exp(i\\Delta \\Delta t - \\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\right]\n$$\nLet a complex number $Z(\\Delta) = (U_{ee})^2 |U_{eg}|^2$. The expression for $P_e$ becomes:\n$$\nP_e(\\Delta) = 2|U_{eg}|^2 |U_{ee}|^2 + 2 \\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\text{Re}\\left[ Z(\\Delta) \\exp(i\\Delta \\Delta t) \\right]\n$$\nLet's express $Z(\\Delta)$ in polar form, $Z(\\Delta) = |Z(\\Delta)| \\exp(i\\delta(\\Delta))$. Then the real part becomes $|Z(\\Delta)|\\cos(\\Delta\\Delta t + \\delta(\\Delta))$. We note that $|Z(\\Delta)| = |(U_{ee})^2| |U_{eg}|^2 = |U_{ee}|^2 |U_{eg}|^2$.\n$$\nP_e(\\Delta) = 2|U_{eg}|^2 |U_{ee}|^2 + 2 |U_{ee}|^2 |U_{eg}|^2 \\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\cos(\\Delta\\Delta t + \\delta(\\Delta))\n$$\nLet's define $C(\\Delta) = 2|U_{eg}|^2 |U_{ee}|^2$. This term represents the amplitude of the population transfer.\n$$\nP_e(\\Delta) = C(\\Delta) \\left[ 1 + \\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\cos(\\Delta\\Delta t + \\delta(\\Delta)) \\right]\n$$\nThe problem defines visibility $V$ by finding the maximum and minimum of $P_e$ as $\\Delta$ is scanned. The expression for $P_e(\\Delta)$ describes oscillations with a frequency given by $\\Delta t$ and a phase $\\delta(\\Delta)$, modulated by an envelope function $C(\\Delta)$. Both $C(\\Delta)$ and $\\delta(\\Delta)$ depend on $\\Delta$ through $\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}$ and $\\theta$.\nThe standard definition of visibility in interferometry refers to the contrast of the fast oscillations at a given point in the slowly varying envelope. We adopt this physically meaningful interpretation. For a given $\\Delta$, the population oscillates as a function of the interferometric phase. The extrema $P_{\\max}$ and $P_{\\min}$ are the values of the fringe envelope at that $\\Delta$.\nThus, for any given (local) $\\Delta$:\n$$\nP_{\\max}(\\Delta) = C(\\Delta) \\left[ 1 + \\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\min}(\\Delta) = C(\\Delta) \\left[ 1 - \\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\right]\n$$\nNow we apply the definition of visibility $V$:\n$$\nV = \\frac{P_{\\max} - P_{\\min}}{P_{\\max} + P_{\\min}} = \\frac{C(\\Delta)[2\\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t)]}{C(\\Delta)[2]} = \\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t)\n$$\nThe visibility $V$ is a direct measure of the remaining coherence after the free evolution period $\\Delta t$ and is independent of the pulse parameters $\\Omega_R$ and $\\Delta$, provided the pulses create some coherence ($C(\\Delta) \\neq 0$). The problem's request for the expression in terms of $\\Delta$ and $\\Omega_R$ is satisfied by a function that has zero partial derivatives with respect to these variables.\n\n**Condition for Maximal Contrast:**\nThe contrast of the fringes may be defined as $K = P_{\\max} - P_{\\min} = 2C(\\Delta)\\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t)$. To maximize this contrast, one must maximize the fringe amplitude function $C(\\Delta)$.\n$$\nC(\\Delta) = 2|U_{eg}|^2 |U_{ee}|^2 = 2 \\rho_{ee,1}(\\Delta) \\rho_{gg,1}(\\Delta) = 2 \\rho_{ee,1}(\\Delta) (1-\\rho_{ee,1}(\\Delta))\n$$\nThis function of $\\rho_{ee,1}$ is maximized when $\\rho_{ee,1}(\\Delta) = 1/2$. This corresponds to the first pulse creating an equal superposition of the ground and excited states. The condition is:\n$$\n\\rho_{ee,1} = \\left(\\frac{\\Omega_R}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\right)^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis condition is most straightforwardly met on resonance ($\\Delta=0$), where $\\Omega_{\\text{eff}} = \\Omega_R$ and $\\theta = \\Omega_R \\tau$. The condition becomes $\\sin^2(\\Omega_R \\tau/2) = 1/2$, which implies $\\Omega_R \\tau/2 = \\pi/4$, or $\\Omega_R \\tau = \\pi/2$. Thus, the contrast is maximal for resonant $\\pi/2$-pulses.\nThe final answer required is only the expression for $V$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t)}\n$$", "id": "2629814"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the manipulation of quantum states, we now apply these ideas to steer a chemical reaction.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Kinetic Energy Release (KER)**\n\nThe total energy of the system on the excited electronic state, $E_{e}$, is conserved. It is the sum of the nuclear kinetic energy $T(R)$ and the potential energy $V_{e}(R)$.\n$$E_{e} = T(R) + V_{e}(R)$$\nAt the moment of the dump transition at internuclear separation $R_{d}$, the kinetic energy of the nuclei on the excited state is:\n$$T(R_{d}) = E_{e} - V_{e}(R_{d})$$\nThe dump transition to the ground-state fragment channel $i$ is vertical. This means it occurs at a fixed nuclear configuration $R_{d}$ and with conservation of nuclear kinetic energy. Immediately after the transition, the system is on the ground state potential surface $V_{g,i}(R)$ at the same position $R_{d}$ and with the same kinetic energy $T(R_{d})$. The total energy on this ground state channel, $E_{g,i}$, is therefore:\n$$E_{g,i} = T(R_{d}) + V_{g,i}(R_{d})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T(R_{d})$:\n$$E_{g,i} = (E_{e} - V_{e}(R_{d})) + V_{g,i}(R_{d}) = E_{e} - (V_{e}(R_{d}) - V_{g,i}(R_{d}))$$\nAs the fragments separate, their internuclear distance $R$ approaches infinity ($R \\to \\infty$). The potential energy approaches the asymptotic energy of the fragment channel, $V_{g,i}(\\infty)$. The kinetic energy release, $\\mathrm{KER}_{i}$, is the kinetic energy of the fragments at this limit. By conservation of energy on the ground state surface:\n$$E_{g,i} = \\mathrm{KER}_{i} + V_{g,i}(\\infty)$$\nSolving for $\\mathrm{KER}_{i}$ and substituting the expression for $E_{g,i}$ yields the general relation:\n$$\\mathrm{KER}_{i} = E_{g,i} - V_{g,i}(\\infty) = E_{e} - (V_{e}(R_{d}) - V_{g,i}(R_{d})) - V_{g,i}(\\infty)$$\nThis expression connects the KER to the excited-state total energy $E_{e}$, the potential energy gap at the dump position $R_{d}$, and the ground-state asymptote $V_{g,i}(\\infty)$. The dump position is determined by the propagation time, $R_{d}=R(t_{d})$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Condon Point**\n\nThe dump pulse is resonant at the Condon point $R_{1}^{*}$, where the photon energy $\\hbar\\omega_{d}$ matches the local vertical energy gap between the excited state and ground state channel $1$, $\\Delta_{1}(R_{1}^{*})$.\n$$\\hbar\\omega_{d} = \\Delta_{1}(R_{1}^{*}) = V_{e}(R_{1}^{*}) - V_{g,1}(R_{1}^{*})$$\nUsing the provided linear approximation for the energy gap:\n$$\\Delta_{1}(R) \\approx \\Delta_{1} + \\alpha(R-R_{0})$$\nWe set $R=R_{1}^{*}$ and solve for the displacement $(R_{1}^{*} - R_{0})$.\n$$\\hbar\\omega_{d} = \\Delta_{1} + \\alpha(R_{1}^{*} - R_{0})$$\n$$R_{1}^{*} - R_{0} = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_{d} - \\Delta_{1}}{\\alpha}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$R_{1}^{*} - R_{0} = \\frac{1.55\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 1.75\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{-0.0500\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-1}} = \\frac{-0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{-0.0500\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-1}} = 4.0\\,\\text{\\AA}$$\nThe Condon point is located at a distance of $4.0\\,\\text{\\AA}$ beyond the initial separation $R_{0}$.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the Pump-Dump Delay**\n\nThe wavepacket center propagates on the excited state according to $R(t) = R_{0} + vt$. The pump-dump delay, $t_d$, is the time required for the wavepacket center to travel from $R_{0}$ to $R_{1}^{*}$.\n$$R(t_{d}) = R_{1}^{*} \\implies R_{0} + vt_{d} = R_{1}^{*}$$\nSolving for $t_{d}$:\n$$t_{d} = \\frac{R_{1}^{*} - R_{0}}{v}$$\nFirst, the speed $v$ must be calculated from $v=\\sqrt{2T_{0}/\\mu}$. We must use a consistent set of units, for example, SI units.\nThe kinetic energy is $T_{0} = 0.207\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.

Let $H_0$ be the field-free Hamiltonian restricted to this four-state manifold, and $H_1$ be the dipole interaction Hamiltonian corresponding to the $z$-polarized laser field amplitude $u(t)$ in the electric-dipole approximation, so that the dynamics of the unitary propagator $U(t)$ obey the time-dependent Schrödinger equation\n$$\n\\dot{U}(t) = -i \\big( H_0 + u(t) H_1 \\big) U(t), \\qquad U(0)=\\mathbb{I}.\n$$\nIn the ordered basis $\\{|1 \\rangle,|2 \\rangle,|3 \\rangle,|4 \\rangle\\}$, the selection rules imply that the control Hamiltonian is block-diagonal with two independent $2\\times 2$ couplings,\n$$\nH_1 = \\mu_{12} ( |1 \\rangle \\langle 2| + |2 \\rangle \\langle 1| ) \\oplus \\mu_{34} ( |3 \\rangle \\langle 4| + |4 \\rangle \\langle 3| ),\n$$\nwith nonzero dipole matrix elements $\\mu_{12},\\mu_{34} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and the drift Hamiltonian is diagonal,\n$$\nH_0 = \\operatorname{diag}(E_1,E_2,E_3,E_4).\n$$\nDefine the traceless drift $\\tilde{H}_0 = H_0 - \\tfrac{1}{4}\\operatorname{tr}(H_0)\\,\\mathbb{I}$ so that the associated skew-Hermitian generators $i \\tilde{H}_0$ and $i H_1$ live in the special unitary Lie algebra $ \\mathfrak{su}(4)$. The dynamical Lie algebra is defined as\n$$\n\\mathfrak{g} = \\operatorname{Lie}\\{ i \\tilde{H}_0,\\, i H_1 \\} \\subset \\mathfrak{su}(4),\n$$\nthe smallest real Lie algebra containing these generators.\n\nStarting from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the electric-dipole selection rules, and the definition of the dynamical Lie algebra as the real Lie algebra generated by commutators and linear combinations of the skew-Hermitian Hamiltonians, show that the symmetry-induced block-diagonal structure causes a decomposition into two invariant two-dimensional subspaces. Compute the real dimension of $\\mathfrak{g}$ by explicitly identifying the independent generators obtained from commutators within each block and any additional traceless block-identity generator arising from the difference of block centroids. Conclude from the dimension you compute that the reachable set $\\exp(\\mathfrak{g})$ is a proper subgroup of $\\mathrm{SU}(4)$.\n\nWhat is the real dimension of $\\mathfrak{g}$? Express your answer as an integer (no units, no rounding necessary).", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the real dimension of the dynamical Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g} = \\operatorname{Lie}\\{ i \\tilde{H}_0,\\, i H_1 \\}$, where the Hamiltonians operate on a four-dimensional state space with basis $\\{|1 \\rangle,|2 \\rangle,|3 \\rangle,|4 \\rangle\\}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the matrix representations of the Hamiltonians in the specified ordered basis. The drift Hamiltonian $H_0$ is diagonal:\n$$\nH_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} E_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & E_2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & E_3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & E_4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe control Hamiltonian $H_1$ is block-diagonal due to the electric-dipole selection rules $\\Delta m = 0$ and $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$:\n$$\nH_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\mu_{12} & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\mu_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\mu_{34} \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\mu_{34} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_{12}\\sigma_x & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\mu_{34}\\sigma_x \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ is the first Pauli matrix.\n\nThe generators of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ are skew-Hermitian and belong to $\\mathfrak{su}(4)$, meaning they are traceless. The first generator is $A_2 = i H_1$:\n$$\nA_2 = i H_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & i\\mu_{12} & 0 & 0 \\\\ i\\mu_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & i\\mu_{34} \\\\ 0 & 0 & i\\mu_{34} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix is clearly traceless since its diagonal elements are all zero. The second generator is $A_1 = i \\tilde{H}_0$, where $\\tilde{H}_0 = H_0 - \\frac{1}{4}\\operatorname{tr}(H_0)\\,\\mathbb{I}$. Let $S = \\frac{1}{4}\\operatorname{tr}(H_0) = \\frac{1}{4}(E_1+E_2+E_3+E_4)$.\n$$\nA_1 = i \\tilde{H}_0 = i \\begin{pmatrix} E_1-S & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & E_2-S & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & E_3-S & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & E_4-S \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nBy construction, $\\operatorname{tr}(A_1) = i\\sum_{k=1}^4 (E_k-S) = i(\\sum E_k - 4S) = 0$.\n\nBoth generators $A_1$ and $A_2$ are block-diagonal, of the form $M = M^{(1)} \\oplus M^{(2)}$. The Lie bracket (commutator) of two block-diagonal matrices is also block-diagonal: $[A \\oplus B, C \\oplus D] = (AC-CA) \\oplus (BD-DB) = [A,C] \\oplus [B,D]$. Consequently, all elements of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ will be block-diagonal. The algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is therefore a subalgebra of the set of all $4 \\times 4$ block-diagonal skew-Hermitian traceless matrices. This maximal block-diagonal subalgebra is denoted $s(\\mathfrak{u}(2) \\times \\mathfrak{u}(2))$.\n\nLet us determine the dimension of $s(\\mathfrak{u}(2) \\times \\mathfrak{u}(2))$. An element $X$ in this algebra has the form $X = X_1 \\oplus X_2$, where $X_1, X_2 \\in \\mathfrak{u}(2)$. Any element of $\\mathfrak{u}(2)$ can be written as a linear combination of $i\\mathbb{I}_2$ and the three generators of $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ (e.g., $i\\sigma_x, i\\sigma_y, i\\sigma_z$). So, $X_1 = c_1 i\\mathbb{I}_2 + T_1$ and $X_2 = c_2 i\\mathbb{I}_2 + T_2$, with $T_1, T_2 \\in \\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The traceless condition on $X$ implies $\\operatorname{tr}(X_1) + \\operatorname{tr}(X_2) = 0$. Since $\\operatorname{tr}(T_1)=\\operatorname{tr}(T_2)=0$, we have $2ic_1 + 2ic_2 = 0$, which yields $c_2 = -c_1$.\nThus, any element of $s(\\mathfrak{u}(2) \\times \\mathfrak{u}(2))$ has the form $(c_1 i\\mathbb{I}_2 + T_1) \\oplus (-c_1 i\\mathbb{I}_2 + T_2)$. This space is spanned by:\n$1.$ Three generators for $T_1$ in the first block ($\\mathfrak{su}(2)_1$).\n$2.$ Three generators for $T_2$ in the second block ($\\mathfrak{su}(2)_2$).\n$3.$ One generator of the form $i\\mathbb{I}_2 \\oplus -i\\mathbb{I}_2$.\nThe total dimension of $s(\\mathfrak{u}(2) \\times \\mathfrak{u}(2))$ is $3 + 3 + 1 = 7$.\n\nTo find the dimension of $\\mathfrak{g}$, we must check if our generators $A_1$ and $A_2$ and their repeated commutators span this entire $7$-dimensional space. Let us define a convenient basis for $s(\\mathfrak{u}(2) \\times \\mathfrak{u}(2))$:\n- $\\mathfrak{su}(2)_1$: $\\{L_{1x} = i\\sigma_x \\oplus 0, L_{1y} = i\\sigma_y \\oplus 0, L_{1z} = i\\sigma_z \\oplus 0\\}$\n- $\\mathfrak{su}(2)_2$: $\\{L_{2x} = 0 \\oplus i\\sigma_x, L_{2y} = 0 \\oplus i\\sigma_y, L_{2z} = 0 \\oplus i\\sigma_z\\}$\n- Central element: $L_0 = i\\mathbb{I}_2 \\oplus -i\\mathbb{I}_2$\n\nThe generator $A_2$ is expressed in this basis as:\n$$\nA_2 = \\mu_{12} L_{1x} + \\mu_{34} L_{2x}\n$$\nThe generator $A_1$ is diagonal. We analyze its blocks:\nThe first block is $i \\operatorname{diag}(E_1-S, E_2-S)$. This can be decomposed into a traceless part and a trace part within the $2 \\times 2$ block:\n$i \\operatorname{diag}(E_1-S, E_2-S) = i\\frac{E_1-E_2}{2}\\sigma_z + i\\frac{E_1+E_2-2S}{2}\\mathbb{I}_2$.\nSimilarly, the second block is $i\\frac{E_3-E_4}{2}\\sigma_z + i\\frac{E_3+E_4-2S}{2}\\mathbb{I}_2$.\nLet $\\omega_1 = \\frac{E_1-E_2}{2}$ and $\\omega_2 = \\frac{E_3-E_4}{2}$. The coefficients of the identity matrices are:\n$\\frac{1}{2}(E_1+E_2-2S) = \\frac{1}{2}(E_1+E_2 - \\frac{E_1+E_2+E_3+E_4}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}(E_1+E_2-E_3-E_4)$. Let $C = \\frac{1}{4}(E_1+E_2-E_3-E_4)$.\nThen $\\frac{1}{2}(E_3+E_4-2S) = -C$.\nSo, $A_1$ in the new basis is:\n$$\nA_1 = \\omega_1 L_{1z} + \\omega_2 L_{2z} + C L_0\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\mu_{12}, \\mu_{34} \\neq 0$, $E_1 \\neq E_2$ (so $\\omega_1 \\neq 0$), $E_3 \\neq E_4$ (so $\\omega_2 \\neq 0$), and $(E_1+E_2) \\neq (E_3+E_4)$ (so $C \\neq 0$).\n\nNow we compute commutators to generate the whole algebra.\n$$\n[A_1, A_2] = [\\omega_1 L_{1z} + \\omega_2 L_{2z} + C L_0, \\mu_{12} L_{1x} + \\mu_{34} L_{2x}]\n$$\nUsing $[L_{1i}, L_{2j}] = 0$, $[L_{iz}, L_0]=0$, and $[L_{jz}, L_{jx}] = 2L_{jy}$, we get:\n$$\n[A_1, A_2] = \\omega_1 \\mu_{12} [L_{1z}, L_{1x}] + \\omega_2 \\mu_{34} [L_{2z}, L_{2x}] = 2\\omega_1 \\mu_{12} L_{1y} + 2\\omega_2 \\mu_{34} L_{2y}\n$$\nLet this new generator be $A_3$. It is a linear combination of $L_{1y}$ and $L_{2y}$ with non-zero coefficients.\nNext, let's compute $[A_1, A_3]$:\n$$\n[A_1, A_3] = [\\omega_1 L_{1z} + \\omega_2 L_{2z} + C L_0, 2\\omega_1 \\mu_{12} L_{1y} + 2\\omega_2 \\mu_{34} L_{2y}]\n$$\nUsing $[L_{jz}, L_{jy}] = -2L_{jx}$:\n$$\n[A_1, A_3] = (2\\omega_1 \\mu_{12})\\omega_1 [L_{1z}, L_{1y}] + (2\\omega_2 \\mu_{34})\\omega_2 [L_{2z}, L_{2y}] = -4\\omega_1^2 \\mu_{12} L_{1x} - 4\\omega_2^2 \\mu_{34} L_{2x}\n$$\nLet this be $A_4$. We now have two distinct linear combinations of $L_{1x}$ and $L_{2x}$: $A_2$ and $A_4$. We can solve for $L_{1x}$ and $L_{2x}$ individually provided the determinant of the coefficients is non-zero:\n$\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_{12} & \\mu_{34} \\\\ -4\\omega_1^2 \\mu_{12} & -4\\omega_2^2 \\mu_{34} \\end{pmatrix} = -4\\mu_{12}\\mu_{34}(\\omega_2^2 - \\omega_1^2)$.\nThis determinant is non-zero if $\\omega_1^2 \\neq \\omega_2^2$, i.e., $(E_1-E_2)^2 \\neq (E_3-E_4)^2$. This is a genericity condition. The problem statement's reference to a \"weak static Stark field\" that \"slightly lifts accidental degeneracies\" implies that such specific resonance conditions on energy differences are not met. Thus we assume this condition holds.\nWith this, $L_{1x}$ and $L_{2x}$ are in $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nOnce we have $L_{1x}$ and $L_{2x}$ in $\\mathfrak{g}$:\n- $[A_1, L_{1x}] = \\omega_1 [L_{1z}, L_{1x}] = 2\\omega_1 L_{1y}$. Since $\\omega_1 \\neq 0$, $L_{1y} \\in \\mathfrak{g}$.\n- $[L_{1x}, L_{1y}] = -[i\\sigma_x, i\\sigma_y] \\oplus 0 = [ \\sigma_x, \\sigma_y ]\\oplus 0 = 2i\\sigma_z \\oplus 0 = 2L_{1z}$. Thus $L_{1z} \\in \\mathfrak{g}$.\nThe entire $\\mathfrak{su}(2)_1$ algebra, spanned by $\\{L_{1x}, L_{1y}, L_{1z}\\}$, is generated.\n- Similarly, from $[A_1, L_{2x}]$ and subsequent commutators, the entire $\\mathfrak{su}(2)_2$ algebra, spanned by $\\{L_{2x}, L_{2y}, L_{2z}\\}$, is generated.\n\nSo far, we have generated a $6$-dimensional subalgebra $\\mathfrak{su}(2)_1 \\oplus \\mathfrak{su}(2)_2$.\nFinally, we inspect the generator $A_1 = \\omega_1 L_{1z} + \\omega_2 L_{2z} + C L_0$. We can write $C L_0 = A_1 - \\omega_1 L_{1z} - \\omega_2 L_{2z}$. Since $A_1, L_{1z}, L_{2z}$ are all in $\\mathfrak{g}$, their linear combination $C L_0$ must also be in $\\mathfrak{g}$.\nAs established, the condition $(E_1+E_2) \\neq (E_3+E_4)$ implies $C \\neq 0$. Therefore, we can isolate $L_0 = (1/C)(C L_0)$, so $L_0 \\in \\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nWe have successfully generated all $3+3+1=7$ basis elements of $s(\\mathfrak{u}(2) \\times \\mathfrak{u}(2))$. Thus, the dynamical Lie algebra is the entire block-diagonal subalgebra: $\\mathfrak{g} = s(\\mathfrak{u}(2) \\times \\mathfrak{u}(2))$.\nThe real dimension of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is $7$.\nThe Lie algebra of the full special unitary group $\\mathrm{SU}(4)$ is $\\mathfrak{su}(4)$, which has dimension $4^2-1=15$. Since $\\operatorname{dim}(\\mathfrak{g}) = 7 < 15 = \\operatorname{dim}(\\mathfrak{su}(4))$, the algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a proper subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{su}(4)$. This implies that the set of reachable unitary transformations, $\\exp(\\mathfrak{g})$, is a proper subgroup of $\\mathrm{SU}(4)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7}\n$$", "id": "2629821"}]}
