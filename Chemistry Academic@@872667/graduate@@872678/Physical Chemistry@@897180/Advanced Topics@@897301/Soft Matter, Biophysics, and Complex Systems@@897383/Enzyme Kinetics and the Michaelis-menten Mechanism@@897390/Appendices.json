The validity of the SSA rests on the principle of timescale separation. The concentration of the reactive intermediate, $[ES]$, must adjust to changes in substrate and product concentrations on a timescale much faster than the timescale on which the substrate is consumed. This condition is generally met when the total enzyme concentration is much smaller than the substrate concentration, i.e., $[E]_{\\mathrm{T}} \\ll [S]_0 + K_M$, which is a standard condition for initial-rate enzyme kinetics. Under such conditions, a brief pre-steady state phase occurs during which $[ES]$ rapidly builds up to a low, quasi-constant value, $[ES]_{ss}$. After this phase, the rate of change of $[ES]$ is negligible compared to the rate of change of $[P]$:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0 $$\nApplying the SSA to the differential equation for $[ES]$:\n$$ k_1 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S] - (k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]_{ss} \\approx 0 $$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration $[ES]_{ss}$:\n$$ [ES]_{ss} = \\frac{k_1 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S]}{k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_2} $$\nThe initial rate of reaction, $v_0$, is obtained by substituting this expression into the rate law for product formation, evaluated under initial conditions where $[S] \\approx [S]_0$:\n$$ v_0 = k_2 [ES]_{ss} = \\frac{k_1 k_2 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S]}{k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_2} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged into the familiar form of the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$ v_0 = \\frac{k_2 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S]}{\\frac{k_{-1}+k_2}{k_1} + [S]} = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_M + [S]} $$\nwhere $V_{max} = k_2 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $K_M = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$. The catalytic rate constant is $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = k_2$.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation for the low-substrate limit, where $[S]$ is small. In this regime, specifically when $[S] \\ll K_M$, the $[S]$ term in the denominator $(K_M + [S])$ becomes negligible compared to $K_M$.

The expression $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M} = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2}$ reveals the contributions of the individual steps. The denominator, $k_{-1} + k_2$, represents the sum of rates for the two possible fates of the $ES$ complex: dissociation back to $E+S$ (rate constant $k_{-1}$) or conversion to product $E+P$ (rate constant $k_2$). The step with the larger rate constant will have a smaller impact on limiting the overall reaction, while the smaller rate constant represents a bottleneck.\n\nLet us compare the magnitudes of $k_{-1}$ and $k_2$:\n$k_{-1} = 1.200 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} = 1200 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_2 = 7.50 \\times 10^1 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} = 75.0 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$\nWe observe that $k_{-1} \\gg k_2$. This means that the rate of dissociation of the $ES$ complex back to free enzyme and substrate is significantly faster than the rate of catalytic turnover to product. The ratio is $k_{-1}/k_2 = 1200 / 75.0 = 16$.\nBecause $k_{-1} \\gg k_2$, the approximation for $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_M$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{K_M} \\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}} = \\frac{k_2}{K_d} $$\nwhere $K_d = k_{-1}/k_1$ is the dissociation constant for the $ES$ complex. This situation corresponds to the rapid-equilibrium limit, where the initial binding step $E+S \\xrightleftharpoons{} ES$ is essentially at equilibrium, determined by $K_d$. The overall rate is then limited by the subsequent, much slower, chemical conversion step governed by $k_2$.

The Lagrangian is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, \\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 - \\lambda (y_1 - y_2 - y_3 + y_4 - \\ln(K_{\\text{eq}})) $$\nSetting the partial derivatives with respect to each $y_i$ to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_1} = 2(y_1 - \\hat{y}_1) - \\lambda = 0 \\implies y_1 - \\hat{y}_1 = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_2} = 2(y_2 - \\hat{y}_2) + \\lambda = 0 \\implies y_2 - \\hat{y}_2 = -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_3} = 2(y_3 - \\hat{y}_3) + \\lambda = 0 \\implies y_3 - \\hat{y}_3 = -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_4} = 2(y_4 - \\hat{y}_4) - \\lambda = 0 \\implies y_4 - \\hat{y}_4 = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} $$\nThe optimal values $y_i^*$ are thus $y_1^* = \\hat{y}_1 + \\lambda/2$, $y_2^* = \\hat{y}_2 - \\lambda/2$, $y_3^* = \\hat{y}_3 - \\lambda/2$, and $y_4^* = \\hat{y}_4 + \\lambda/2$.\n\nSubstituting these into the constraint equation $y_1^* - y_2^* - y_3^* + y_4^* = \\ln(K_{\\text{eq}})$:\n$$ (\\hat{y}_1 + \\lambda/2) - (\\hat{y}_2 - \\lambda/2) - (\\hat{y}_3 - \\lambda/2) + (\\hat{y}_4 + \\lambda/2) = \\ln(K_{\\text{eq}}) $$\n$$ (\\hat{y}_1 - \\hat{y}_2 - \\hat{y}_3 + \\hat{y}_4) + \\lambda(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}) = \\ln(K_{\\text{eq}}) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\hat{x}_1 \\hat{x}_4}{\\hat{x}_2 \\hat{x}_3}\\right) + 2\\lambda = \\ln(K_{\\text{eq}}) $$\nLet $\\hat{K}_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{\\hat{x}_1 \\hat{x}_4}{\\hat{x}_2 \\hat{x}_3} = \\frac{\\hat{k}_{\\text{cat},f} \\hat{K}_{M,P}}{\\hat{k}_{\\text{cat},r} \\hat{K}_{M,S}}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\ln(\\hat{K}_{\\text{eq}}) + 2\\lambda = \\ln(K_{\\text{eq}}) \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{\\text{eq}}}{\\hat{K}_{\\text{eq}}}\\right) $$\nThe problem asks for the correction factor $c$ for the forward catalytic constant, $k_{\\text{cat},f}^* = c\\,\\hat{k}_{\\text{cat},f}$. This means $x_1^* = c\\,\\hat{x}_1$.\nTaking the logarithm: $y_1^* = \\ln(c) + \\hat{y}_1$.\nFrom our Lagrange multiplier result, we have $y_1^* - \\hat{y}_1 = \\lambda/2$.\nTherefore, $\\ln(c) = \\lambda/2$.\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\ln(c) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{\\text{eq}}}{\\hat{K}_{\\text{eq}}}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{4} \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{\\text{eq}}}{\\hat{K}_{\\text{eq}}}\\right) $$\nExponentiating both sides yields the expression for the correction factor:\n$$ c = \\left(\\frac{K_{\\text{eq}}}{\\hat{K}_{\\text{eq}}}\\right)^{1/4} $$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$ \\hat{k}_{\\text{cat},f} = 85 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\hat{k}_{\\text{cat},r} = 37 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\hat{K}_{M,S} = 0.12 \\, \\text{mM} $$\n$$ \\hat{K}_{M,P} = 0.35 \\, \\text{mM} $$\n$$ K_{\\text{eq}} = 7.5 $$\nFirst, calculate the value of the Haldane product from the uncorrected estimates:\n$$ \\hat{K}_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{\\hat{k}_{\\text{cat},f} \\hat{K}_{M,P}}{\\hat{k}_{\\text{cat},r} \\hat{K}_{M,S}} = \\frac{85 \\times 0.35}{37 \\times 0.12} = \\frac{29.75}{4.44} \\approx 6.70045 $$\nNow, calculate the correction factor $c$:\n$$ c = \\left(\\frac{7.5}{29.75 / 4.44}\\right)^{1/4} = \\left(\\frac{7.5 \\times 4.44}{29.75}\\right)^{1/4} = \\left(\\frac{33.3}{29.75}\\right)^{1/4} $$\n$$ c \\approx (1.1193277)^{0.25} \\approx 1.028553 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $1.029$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.029}$$", "id": "2638165"}]}
