This exercise [@problem_id:1520113] provides a fundamental hands-on calculation, connecting this difference in activation energy directly to the ratio of rate constants, $k_H/k_D$, using a simplified Arrhenius model.

A chemist is investigating a novel catalytic C-H bond activation reaction. The rate-determining step is believed to be the cleavage of this C-H bond.

A large primary KIE often confirms that a specific bond is broken in the rate-determining step (RDS), but what does a KIE value close to unity signify? This practice problem [@problem_id:1520161] challenges you to think like an experimentalist, deducing which steps of a multi-step enzymatic reaction are consistent with an observed KIE of approximately one. It highlights that the absence of a large KIE can be just as mechanistically informative as its presence.", "problem": "An enzymologist is investigating the mechanism of a newly discovered enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol ($CH_3CH_2OH$) to acetaldehyde ($CH_3CHO$). To probe the reaction mechanism, the kinetic properties of the reaction are studied using both normal ethanol and an isotopically labeled version, ethanol-1,1-d2 ($CH_3CD_2OH$), where both hydrogens on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group are replaced with deuterium.\n\nA simplified multi-step mechanism is proposed for the enzymatic reaction:\nStep 1: The ethanol substrate binds to the enzyme's active site.\nStep 2: An intramolecular hydrogen transfer occurs, breaking one of the C-H (or C-D) bonds at the C1 position.\nStep 3: The acetaldehyde product is released from the enzyme.\n\nThe overall rate of product formation is measured for both substrates under identical conditions. The experiment reveals that the rate constant for the reaction with normal ethanol, $k_H$, is virtually identical to the rate constant for the reaction with deuterated ethanol, $k_D$. The observed Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE), defined as the ratio $k_H/k_D$, is determined to be 1.02.\n\nBased solely on this KIE value, which of the following conclusions can be drawn about the rate-determining step (RDS) of the overall enzymatic reaction?\n\nA.

Conversely, when the rate-determining step does not involve cleavage of the labeled C-H or C-D bond, only small secondary or equilibrium isotope effects are expected, so the observed KIE remains close to unity.\n\nIn the present system, Step 2 explicitly involves breaking a C-H or C-D bond at C1 and therefore would produce a primary isotope effect if it were the rate-determining step, leading to $k_{H}/k_{D}$ appreciably greater than 1. The observed value $k_{H}/k_{D}=1.02$ is essentially unity, indicating no substantial primary isotope effect. Thus, Step 2 is unlikely to be the rate-determining step.\n\nSteps 1 and 3 do not involve cleavage of the labeled C-H or C-D bond in their transition states; therefore, if either binding (Step 1) or product release (Step 3) were rate-determining, a KIE near unity would be expected. Based solely on the KIE value, one cannot distinguish between these two possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the data support that either Step 1 or Step 3 could be the rate-determining step, but not Step 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1520161"}, {"introduction": "The simple model connecting the KIE solely to zero-point energy differences works well in many cases, but it does not capture all quantum phenomena.
