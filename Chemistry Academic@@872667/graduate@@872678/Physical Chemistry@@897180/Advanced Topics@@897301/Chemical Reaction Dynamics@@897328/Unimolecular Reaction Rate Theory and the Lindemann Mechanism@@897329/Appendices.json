The system is modeled by a set of six coupled linear algebraic equations representing the steady-state populations of six energetically excited states distributed across three potential wells, labeled $\\mathrm{A}$, $\\mathrm{B}$, and $\\mathrm{C}$. The state populations are denoted by $x_{W,i}$, where $W \\in \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{C}\\}$ is the well and $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ is the energy grain index. A constant source, $S_{\\mathrm{A},2} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, feeds population only into state $(\\mathrm{A}, 2)$.\n\nThe governing steady-state master equations are:\n$$0 = S_{\\mathrm{A},2} - x_{\\mathrm{A},2}\\,\\big(k_{\\mathrm{coll}} + k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{B}}^{(2)} + k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{C}}^{(2)}\\big)$$\n$$0 = k_{\\mathrm{coll}}\\,x_{\\mathrm{A},2} - x_{\\mathrm{A},1}\\,\\big(k_{\\mathrm{coll}} + k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)} + k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{C}}^{(1)}\\big)$$\n$$0 = k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{B}}^{(2)}\\,x_{\\mathrm{A},2} - x_{\\mathrm{B},2}\\,\\big(k_{\\mathrm{coll}} + k_{\\mathrm{B}\\to\\mathrm{P_{1}}}^{(2)}\\big)$$\n$$0 = k_{\\mathrm{coll}}\\,x_{\\mathrm{B},2} + k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)}\\,x_{\\mathrm{A},1} - x_{\\mathrm{B},1}\\,\\big(k_{\\mathrm{coll}} + k_{\\mathrm{B}\\to\\mathrm{P_{1}}}^{(1)}\\big)$$\n$$0 = k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{C}}^{(2)}\\,x_{\\mathrm{A},2} - x_{\\mathrm{C},2}\\,\\big(k_{\\mathrm{coll}} + k_{\\mathrm{C}\\to\\mathrm{P_{2}}}^{(2)}\\big)$$\n$$0 = k_{\\mathrm{coll}}\\,x_{\\mathrm{C},2} + k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{C}}^{(1)}\\,x_{\\mathrm{A},1} - x_{\\mathrm{C},1}\\,\\big(k_{\\mathrm{coll}} + k_{\\mathrm{C}\\to\\mathrm{P_{2}}}^{(1)}\\big)$$\n\nHere, $k_{\\mathrm{coll}} = c\\,[\\mathrm{M}]$ is the pressure-dependent collisional deactivation rate, where $c = 1.0\\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{molecule}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $[\\mathrm{M}]$ is the bath gas number density.\n\nThis system of six linear equations for the six unknown populations ($x_{\\mathrm{A},2}$, $x_{\\mathrm{A},1}$, $x_{\\mathrm{B},2}$, $x_{\\mathrm{B},1}$, $x_{\\mathrm{C},2}$, $x_{\\mathrm{C},1}$) exhibits a sequential dependency structure, which permits a direct analytical solution without matrix inversion. The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, the population of state $(\\mathrm{A}, 2)$ is determined solely by the source term and its loss channels:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{A},2} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{A},2}}{k_{\\mathrm{coll}} + k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{B}}^{(2)} + k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{C}}^{(2)}} $$\n\nNext, the population of state $(\\mathrm{A}, 1)$ is determined by collisional feeding from $(\\mathrm{A}, 2)$ and its own loss channels.\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{A},1} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{coll}}\\,x_{\\mathrm{A},2}}{k_{\\mathrm{coll}} + k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)} + k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{C}}^{(1)}} $$\n\nThe populations in wells $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{C}$ are then determined. The high-energy grain populations, $x_{\\mathrm{B},2}$ and $x_{\\mathrm{C},2}$, are fed from $x_{\\mathrm{A},2}$:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{B},2} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{B}}^{(2)}\\,x_{\\mathrm{A},2}}{k_{\\mathrm{coll}} + k_{\\mathrm{B}\\to\\mathrm{P_{1}}}^{(2)}} $$\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{C},2} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{C}}^{(2)}\\,x_{\\mathrm{A},2}}{k_{\\mathrm{coll}} + k_{\\mathrm{C}\\to\\mathrm{P_{2}}}^{(2)}} $$\n\nFinally, the low-energy grain populations, $x_{\\mathrm{B},1}$ and $x_{\\mathrm{C},1}$, are fed by two pathways: collisional deactivation from the higher grain within the same well and isomerization from well $\\mathrm{A}$ at the same energy level.\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{B},1} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{coll}}\\,x_{\\mathrm{B},2} + k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)}\\,x_{\\mathrm{A},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{coll}} + k_{\\mathrm{B}\\to\\mathrm{P_{1}}}^{(1)}} $$\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{C},1} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{coll}}\\,x_{\\mathrm{C},2} + k_{\\mathrm{A}\\to\\mathrm{C}}^{(1)}\\,x_{\\mathrm{A},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{coll}} + k_{\\mathrm{C}\\to\\mathrm{P_{2}}}^{(1)}} $$\n\nWith the steady-state populations determined, the fluxes to the product channels $\\mathrm{P_{1}}$ and $\\mathrm{P_{2}}$ are computed.\n$$ J_{1} = k_{\\mathrm{B}\\to\\mathrm{P_{1}}}^{(2)}\\,x_{\\mathrm{B},2} + k_{\\mathrm{B}\\to\\mathrm{P_{1}}}^{(1)}\\,x_{\\mathrm{B},1} $$\n$$ J_{2} = k_{\\mathrm{C}\\to\\mathrm{P_{2}}}^{(2)}\\,x_{\\mathrm{C},2} + k_{\\mathrm{C}\\to\\mathrm{P_{2}}}^{(1)}\\,x_{\\mathrm{C},1} $$\n\nThe branching fractions $\\beta_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2}$ are the normalized fluxes, representing the conditional probability of forming a given product, subsequent to reaction from any of the tracked energized states.\n$$ \\beta_{1} = \\frac{J_{1}}{J_{1}+J_{2}} $$\n$$ \\beta_{2} = \\frac{J_{2}}{J_{1}+J_{2}} = 1 - \\beta_{1} $$\n\nA computational program will implement these analytical expressions, using the provided numerical parameters for the rate constants and iterating over the four specified values of the bath gas density $[\\mathrm{M}]$ to calculate the corresponding branching fractions.
