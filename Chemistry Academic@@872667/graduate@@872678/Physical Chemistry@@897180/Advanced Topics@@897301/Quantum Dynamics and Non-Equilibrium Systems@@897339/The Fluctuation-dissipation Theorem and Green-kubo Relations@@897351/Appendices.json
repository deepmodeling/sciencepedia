The fundamental principle connecting the response of a system to an external field with its internal equilibrium fluctuations is the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). For a classical system at absolute temperature $T$, the FDT relates the power spectral density of the fluctuations, $C_{AA}(\\omega)$, to the imaginary (dissipative) part of the dynamic susceptibility, $\\chi''(\\omega)$. Using the Fourier transform conventions specified in the problem, this relation is:\n$$C_{AA}(\\omega) = \\frac{2 k_B T}{\\omega} \\chi''(\\omega)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $C_{AA}(\\omega)$ is the forward Fourier transform of $C_{AA}(t)$. The Wiener-Khinchin theorem identifies this frequency-domain representation of the autocorrelation function, $C_{AA}(\\omega)$, as the power spectral density of the process $\\delta A(t)$.\n\nOur first step is to extract the imaginary part, $\\chi''(\\omega)$, from the given complex susceptibility:\n$$\\chi(\\omega) = \\frac{\\chi_{0}}{1-i\\,\\omega\\,\\tau}$$\nTo separate the real and imaginary parts, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is $1+i\\,\\omega\\,\\tau$:\n$$\\chi(\\omega) = \\frac{\\chi_{0}}{1-i\\,\\omega\\,\\tau} \\cdot \\frac{1+i\\,\\omega\\,\\tau}{1+i\\,\\omega\\,\\tau} = \\frac{\\chi_{0}(1+i\\,\\omega\\,\\tau)}{1^2 - (i\\,\\omega\\,\\tau)^2} = \\frac{\\chi_{0} + i\\,\\chi_{0}\\,\\omega\\,\\tau}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau^2}$$\nThis expression can be separated into its real part, $\\chi'(\\omega)$, and its imaginary part, $\\chi''(\\omega)$:\n$$\\chi'(\\omega) = \\frac{\\chi_{0}}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau^2}, \\quad \\chi''(\\omega) = \\frac{\\chi_{0}\\,\\omega\\,\\tau}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau^2}$$\nSince the problem specifies $\\chi_{0} > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, the dissipative component $\\chi''(\\omega)$ is positive for positive frequencies, as required by physical principles for energy absorption.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\chi''(\\omega)$ into the classical FDT to find the power spectral density $C_{AA}(\\omega)$:\n$$C_{AA}(\\omega) = \\frac{2 k_B T}{\\omega} \\left( \\frac{\\chi_{0}\\,\\omega\\,\\tau}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau^2} \\right) = \\frac{2 k_B T \\chi_0 \\tau}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau^2}$$\nThis Lorentzian function describes the frequency content of the equilibrium fluctuations of the observable $A$.\n\nTo find the time-domain autocorrelation function $C_{AA}(t)$, we must perform the inverse Fourier transform of $C_{AA}(\\omega)$ as defined in the problem statement:\n$$C_{AA}(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\omega\\,\\exp(-i\\,\\omega\\,t) C_{AA}(\\omega)$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $C_{AA}(\\omega)$:\n$$C_{AA}(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\omega\\,\\exp(-i\\,\\omega\\,t) \\left( \\frac{2 k_B T \\chi_0 \\tau}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau^2} \\right)$$\n$$C_{AA}(t) = \\frac{k_B T \\chi_0 \\tau}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\omega\\,\\frac{\\exp(-i\\,\\omega\\,t)}{1 + (\\omega\\tau)^2}$$\nThis integral is a standard form.
