The number of such elements is approximately $\\frac{1}{2}D_{CI}^2$.\n$2$. Diagonalization of the matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ to obtain its eigenvalues (energies) and eigenvectors (wavefunctions). Standard diagonalization algorithms scale as $O(D_{CI}^3)$. For large problems, iterative methods like the Davidson algorithm are employed, with a cost that scales roughly as $O(N_{iter} D_{CI}^2)$ per root, where $N_{iter}$ is the number of iterations required for convergence.\n\nThe expressions derived show that $D_{CI}$ grows combinatorially with the excitation level $k$ and polynomially with the number of orbitals ($n_o$ and $n_v$). Specifically, for a fixed large $k$, $N_k \\sim O(n_o^k n_v^k)$. This rapid, factorial-like growth is known as the \"exponential wall\" of quantum chemistry. As seen from our calculation ($51 \\to 501 \\to 1701$), even for a small system and low excitation levels, the dimension of the CI matrix increases dramatically.

We find its corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{c} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n    $$\n    \\left(2 - \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)c_1 + c_2 = 0 \\implies \\left(\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)c_1 + c_2 = 0\n    $$\n\n2.  **Ritz Vector and Residual:** The new Ritz vector is $\\mathbf{y}^{(2)} = c_1 \\mathbf{v}^{(0)} + c_2 \\mathbf{v}^{(1)}$. The residual $\\mathbf{r}^{(2)} = (\\mathbf{A} - \\theta^{(2)}\\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{y}^{(2)}$ is orthogonal to the subspace $S_2$. Since $\\mathbf{v}^{(0)}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{v}^{(1)}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, any vector in $S_2$ has a zero third component. A vector orthogonal to $S_2$ must be of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}$. The residual calculation confirms this:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{r}^{(2)} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{y}^{(2)} - \\theta^{(2)}\\mathbf{y}^{(2)} = (c_1\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}^{(0)} + c_2\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}^{(1)}) - \\theta^{(2)}(c_1\\mathbf{v}^{(0)} + c_2\\mathbf{v}^{(1)})\n    $$\n    It simplifies to $c_2 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. So $\\mathbf{r}^{(2)}$ is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n3.  **Preconditioned Correction:** We compute $\\mathbf{t}^{(2)}$ using $\\mathbf{r}^{(2)}$ and $\\theta^{(2)} = \\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. The unnormalized residual is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   $t_1^{(2)}=0$, $t_2^{(2)}=0$.\n    *   $t_3^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{A_{33} - \\theta^{(2)}} = \\frac{1}{4 - \\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3+\\sqrt{5}}$.\n    The correction vector $\\mathbf{t}^{(2)}$ is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n4.  **Subspace Expansion:** We orthonormalize the new direction vector, which is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, against the basis $\\{\\mathbf{v}^{(0)}, \\mathbf{v}^{(1)}\\}$. This vector is already orthogonal to both $\\mathbf{v}^{(0)}$ and $\\mathbf{v}^{(1)}$. Its norm is $1$. The new basis vector is $\\mathbf{v}^{(2)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The new subspace $S_3$ is spanned by $B_3 = \\{\\mathbf{v}^{(0)}, \\mathbf{v}^{(1)}, \\mathbf{v}^{(2)}\\}$, which is the standard basis for $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**Final Rayleigh-Ritz Projection**\n\nThe problem asks for the lowest Ritz value in the final three-dimensional subspace. The basis matrix is $V_3 = [\\mathbf{v}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{v}^{(1)} | \\mathbf{v}^{(2)}] = \\mathbf{I}$, the identity matrix. The projected Hamiltonian is:\n$$\nH_3 = V_3^T \\mathbf{A} V_3 = \\mathbf{I}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{I} = \\mathbf{A}\n$$\nTherefore, we must find the eigenvalues of the original matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2-\\lambda & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 3-\\lambda & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 4-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (2-\\lambda)((3-\\lambda)(4-\\lambda)-1) - 1(4-\\lambda) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(2-\\lambda)(\\lambda^2 - 7\\lambda + 11) - (4-\\lambda) = 0\n$$\n$$\n2\\lambda^2 - 14\\lambda + 22 - \\lambda^3 + 7\\lambda^2 - 11\\lambda - 4 + \\lambda = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\lambda^3 + 9\\lambda^2 - 24\\lambda + 18 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\lambda^3 - 9\\lambda^2 + 24\\lambda - 18 = 0\n$$\nBy inspection, $\\lambda = 3$ is a root: $3^3 - 9(3^2) + 24(3) - 18 = 27 - 81 + 72 - 18 = 0$.\nWe divide the cubic polynomial by $(\\lambda - 3)$ to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda^3 - 9\\lambda^2 + 24\\lambda - 18}{\\lambda - 3} = \\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 6\n$$\nThe roots of $\\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 6 = 0$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 4(6)}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{3}\n$$\nThe three eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$ are $3$, $3+\\sqrt{3}$, and $3-\\sqrt{3}$. The lowest of these is $3 - \\sqrt{3}$. This is the lowest Ritz value in the final subspace.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3 - \\sqrt{3}}$$", "id": "2765693"}]}
