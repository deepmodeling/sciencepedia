While the distribution for the $v=1$ initial state can be bimodal, the problem asks for the shift in \"the most intense line,\" which is best interpreted as the shift in the mean (center of gravity) of the vibronic progression.\n\nFor displaced harmonic oscillators with the same frequency, there is a general sum rule for the mean of the final-state vibrational quantum number distribution, $\\bar{v'}$, for a transition originating from level $v$:\n$$\\bar{v'}(v) = \\sum_{v'=0}^{\\infty} v' |\\langle \\chi_{e,v'} | \\chi_{g,v} \\rangle|^2 = S + v$$\nwhere $S = \\frac{m\\omega(\\Delta q)^2}{2\\hbar}$ is the Huang-Rhys factor.\n\nFor the Condon-allowed case, the initial state is $v=0$. The mean of its progression is:\n$$\\bar{v'}_{\\mathrm{Condon}} = S + 0 = S$$\nFor the Herzberg-Teller case, the intensity profile is that of a transition from $v=1$. The mean of its progression is:\n$$\\bar{v'}_{\\mathrm{HT}} = S + 1$$\nThe additive shift $\\Delta v$ is the difference in the mean indices of the progressions:\n$$\\Delta v = \\bar{v'}_{\\mathrm{HT}} - \\bar{v'}_{\\mathrm{Condon}} = (S+1) - S = 1$$\nThe shift is an integer value of $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{m\\omega(\\Delta q)^{2}}{2\\hbar} - \\frac{1}{2} & \\hbar\\omega & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2813873"}]}
