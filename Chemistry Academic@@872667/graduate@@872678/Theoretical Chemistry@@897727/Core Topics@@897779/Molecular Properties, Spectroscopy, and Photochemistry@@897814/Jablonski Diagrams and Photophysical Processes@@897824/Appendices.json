It determines the relative intensities of the bands in the vibronic progression.\n\nThe problem specifies that the molecule is at cryogenic temperature, so only the ground vibrational level of the electronic ground state is populated, i.e., $v''=0$. We are interested in the ratio of intensities for the transition to $v'=1$ (the first vibronic member) and the transition to $v'=0$ (the origin band).

The problem states $\\frac{I_{0-1}}{I_{0-0}} = 0.5$.\n\nWe now use the displaced harmonic oscillator model. In this model, the potential energy surfaces for the ground ($S_0$) and excited ($S_1$) states are harmonic and have the same vibrational frequency $\\omega$, but their minima are displaced by a distance $\\Delta Q$ along a normal coordinate $Q$. The vibrational wavefunctions are the standard solutions to the quantum harmonic oscillator.

The Huang–Rhys factor $S$ is a direct measure of the extent of structural distortion upon electronic excitation.\n- If $S \\ll 1$, the coupling is weak, the geometry change is minimal, and the $0-0$ transition is by far the most intense.\n- If $S \\gg 1$, the coupling is strong, the geometry change is significant, and the intensity maximum of the vibronic progression is shifted to higher vibrational quantum numbers, $v' \\approx S$. The $0-0$ band becomes very weak.\n- If $S \\approx 1$, the coupling is intermediate, and the intensities of the first few bands ($v'=0, 1, 2, ...$) are comparable.\n\nIn this case, $S = 0.5$. Since $S  1$, the most intense band in the progression is the origin band ($v'=0$), as the maximum of the Poisson distribution $P(k) = e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^k/k!$ for $\\lambda  1$ is at $k=0$. The intensity of the next band, $I_{0-1}$, is half that of the origin, which is a considerable fraction. This situation corresponds to weak-to-intermediate coupling. Therefore, the equilibrium geometry change upon excitation is considered to be **minor**. It is not negligible, but it is not large enough to shift the band maximum away from the $0-0$ transition. The value $S=0.5$ indicates a small but measurable displacement between the potential energy minima of the $S_0$ and $S_1$ states. The information about the progression spacing ($1500\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) is consistent with the model of a single dominant mode but is not required for the calculation of $S$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.500}\n$$", "id": "2660704"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of photophysical principles allows us not only to analyze but also to control and engineer molecular behavior.
