The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary parameters and assumptions for its solution are provided. It is therefore deemed valid and a formal derivation may proceed.\n\nThe starting point is the one-dimensional, time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle of mass $m$ and energy $E$ in a potential $V(x)$:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} (V(x) - E) \\psi(x)\n$$\nWithin the classically forbidden region, which is defined by the interval $(x_{a}, x_{b})$ where $V(x)  E$, the term $(V(x) - E)$ is positive. We define a real, position-dependent wave number $\\kappa(x)$ as:\n$$\n\\kappa(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}(V(x) - E)}\n$$\nThe Schrödinger equation in this region thus becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = \\kappa(x)^2 \\psi(x)\n$$\nIn the WKB approximation, the solutions to this equation are given by exponentially growing and decaying functions, where the local amplitude is modulated by the inverse square root of $\\kappa(x)$:\n$$\n\\psi(x) \\approx \\frac{C_{1}}{\\sqrt{\\kappa(x)}} \\exp\\left(\\int^{x} \\kappa(x') dx'\\right) + \\frac{C_{2}}{\\sqrt{\\kappa(x)}} \\exp\\left(-\\int^{x} \\kappa(x') dx'\\right)\n$$\nThe transmission probability $T$ through the barrier represents the ratio of the flux of the transmitted wave to the incident wave. In the leading-order WKB approximation for a high and/or wide barrier (the \"deep-tunneling\" regime), this probability is dominated by the exponential decay of the wavefunction's amplitude as it traverses the non-classical region from $x_{a}$ to $x_{b}$. The coefficient of transmission is found by connecting the oscillatory solutions in the allowed regions to the evanescent solutions inside the barrier. This procedure yields the transmission probability $T$ as:\n$$\nT \\approx \\exp\\left(-2 \\int_{x_{a}}^{x_{b}} \\kappa(x) dx\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\kappa(x)$, we arrive at the first required result: the tunneling transmission probability $T$ to leading semiclassical order.\n$$\nT \\approx \\exp\\left(-2 \\int_{x_{a}}^{x_{b}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}(V(x) - E)} dx\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2}{\\hbar} \\int_{x_{a}}^{x_{b}} \\sqrt{2m(V(x) - E)} dx\\right)\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential, which we will denote as $-\\sigma(m)$, controls the magnitude of the tunneling probability.

The potential $V(x)$ and energy $E$ remain unchanged, as do the classical turning points $x_{a}$ and $x_{b}$ which depend only on $V(x)$ and $E$.

This is a fundamental result of the kinetic isotope effect in the context of tunneling.\n\nFinally, we are asked to find the ratio of reaction rate constants, $k(\\alpha)/k(1)$, under the given assumptions. The problem states that the reaction rate constant $k$ is dominated by barrier transmission and that any pre-exponential factor is insensitive to the mass substitution. This implies a direct proportionality between the rate constant and the transmission probability:\n$$\nk \\propto T\n$$\nLet $k(1)$ be the rate constant for mass $m$ (corresponding to $\\alpha=1$) and $k(\\alpha)$ be the rate constant for mass $\\alpha m$.

The particle mass $m$ and energy $E$ are fixed. Since the transmission probability $T$ decreases exponentially as $\\gamma$ increases, comparing the transmission probabilities $T_{\\mathrm{R}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{P}}$, and $T_{\\mathrm{E}}$ is equivalent to comparing their corresponding Gamow factors $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{R}}$, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{P}}$, and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{E}}$. A larger $\\gamma$ implies a smaller $T$. The ordering of $T$ will be the reverse of the ordering of $\\gamma$.\n\nThe comparison of the Gamow factors reduces to a comparison of the integrals:\n$$ I_i = \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\sqrt{V_i(x)-E} \\, dx $$\nwhere $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{R, P, E}\\}$. The ordering of $\\gamma_i$ will be the same as the ordering of $I_i$.\n\n**1. Comparison of Rectangular Barrier with Parabolic and Eckart Barriers**\n\nFor the rectangular barrier, $V_{\\mathrm{R}}(x) = V_0$ for all $x$ in the classically forbidden region $|x| \\le L/2$.\nFor the parabolic and Eckart barriers, the potential has its maximum $V_0$ only at $x=0$. For any other point within the forbidden region, $|x| \\in (0, L/2)$, their potentials are less than $V_0$.\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{P}}(x)  V_0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad V_{\\mathrm{E}}(x)  V_0 \\quad \\text{for } x \\neq 0 $$\nTherefore, for any $x \\in (-L/2, L/2)$, the following inequality holds for the integrands:\n$$ \\sqrt{V_{\\mathrm{R}}(x)-E} = \\sqrt{V_0-E} \\ge \\sqrt{V_{\\mathrm{P}}(x)-E} $$\n$$ \\sqrt{V_{\\mathrm{R}}(x)-E} = \\sqrt{V_0-E} \\ge \\sqrt{V_{\\mathrm{E}}(x)-E} $$\nThe equality holds only at $x=0$. Integrating over the interval $[-L/2, L/2]$, we find:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{R}}  I_{\\mathrm{P}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad I_{\\mathrm{R}}  I_{\\mathrm{E}} $$\nThis implies $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{R}}  \\gamma_{\\mathrm{P}}$ and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{R}}  \\gamma_{\\mathrm{E}}$. Consequently, the transmission probability through the rectangular barrier is the smallest:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{R}}  T_{\\mathrm{P}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad T_{\\mathrm{R}}  T_{\\mathrm{E}} $$\n\n**2. Comparison of Parabolic and Eckart Barriers**\n\nWe must now compare $I_{\\mathrm{P}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{E}}$. This requires comparing the shapes of $V_{\\mathrm{P}}(x)$ and $V_{\\mathrm{E}}(x)$. Both potentials are constrained by $V(0)=V_0$ and $V(\\pm L/2)=E$. A standard method to compare the shapes of functions near a maximum is to examine their second derivatives (curvature).\n\nFor the parabolic barrier:\n$V_{\\mathrm{P}}(x) = V_0 - \\tfrac{1}{2}m\\omega_b^2 x^2$. The condition $V_{\\mathrm{P}}(\\pm L/2) = E$ gives $E = V_0 - \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_b^2 (L/2)^2$, which determines $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_b^2 = \\frac{V_0-E}{(L/2)^2} = \\frac{4(V_0-E)}{L^2}$.\nThe second derivative is constant:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{P}}''(x) = -m\\omega_b^2 = -\\frac{8(V_0-E)}{L^2} $$\n\nFor the Eckart barrier:\n$V_{\\mathrm{E}}(x) = V_0\\,\\mathrm{sech}^2(\\alpha x)$. The second derivative at $x=0$ is $V_{\\mathrm{E}}''(0) = -2\\alpha^2 V_0$.\nThe condition $V_{\\mathrm{E}}(\\pm L/2) = E$ gives $E = V_0\\,\\mathrm{sech}^2(\\alpha L/2)$, which implies $\\cosh(\\alpha L/2) = \\sqrt{V_0/E}$. From this, $\\alpha = \\frac{2}{L}\\mathrm{arccosh}(\\sqrt{V_0/E})$.\nSubstituting $\\alpha$ into the expression for the second derivative:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{E}}''(0) = -2V_0 \\left( \\frac{2}{L}\\mathrm{arccosh}\\sqrt{\\frac{V_0}{E}} \\right)^2 = -\\frac{8V_0}{L^2} \\left( \\mathrm{arccosh}\\sqrt{\\frac{V_0}{E}} \\right)^2 $$\n\nNow we compare the magnitudes of the curvatures at $x=0$: $|V_{\\mathrm{P}}''(0)|$ versus $|V_{\\mathrm{E}}''(0)|$. This is equivalent to comparing $\\frac{8(V_0-E)}{L^2}$ and $\\frac{8V_0}{L^2} (\\mathrm{arccosh}\\sqrt{V_0/E})^2$, which simplifies to comparing $(V_0-E)$ and $V_0 (\\mathrm{arccosh}\\sqrt{V_0/E})^2$. Let $y = \\sqrt{V_0/E}  1$. The comparison is between $V_0(1-1/y^2)$ and $V_0(\\mathrm{arccosh} y)^2$, or simply $1-1/y^2$ versus $(\\mathrm{arccosh} y)^2$.\n\nConsider the function $g(y) = (\\mathrm{arccosh} y)^2 - (1 - 1/y^2)$ for $y  1$.\nIts derivative is $g'(y) = 2(\\mathrm{arccosh} y) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y^2-1}} + \\frac{2}{y^3}$. For $y  1$, every term is positive, so $g'(y)0$. The function $g(y)$ is strictly increasing.\nIn the limit as $y \\to 1^+$, let $y=1+\\epsilon$ for small $\\epsilon  0$.\n$\\mathrm{arccosh}(1+\\epsilon) \\approx \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$, so $(\\mathrm{arccosh}(1+\\epsilon))^2 \\approx 2\\epsilon$.\n$1 - 1/(1+\\epsilon)^2 \\approx 1 - (1-2\\epsilon) = 2\\epsilon$.\nThus, $\\lim_{y\\to 1^+} g(y) = 0$.\nSince $g(y)$ starts at $0$ (in the limit) and is strictly increasing for $y1$, we must have $g(y)  0$ for all $y1$.\nThis proves that $(\\mathrm{arccosh} y)^2  1 - 1/y^2$, which implies $V_0 (\\mathrm{arccosh}\\sqrt{V_0/E})^2  (V_0-E)$.\nTherefore, $|V_{\\mathrm{E}}''(0)|  |V_{\\mathrm{P}}''(0)|$.\n\nThe Eckart potential is more sharply peaked (has a larger magnitude of curvature) at the maximum than the parabolic potential under the given constraints. This implies that for $x$ in a neighborhood of $0$, $V_{\\mathrm{E}}(x)  V_{\\mathrm{P}}(x)$. The parabolic barrier is \"fatter\" or \"broader\" at the top.\n\nThe WKB integral $I = \\int \\sqrt{V(x)-E}\\,dx$ is most sensitive to the parts of the barrier where $V(x)$ is largest, i.e., near the peak. Since $V_{\\mathrm{P}}(x)  V_{\\mathrm{E}}(x)$ in the region around $x=0$ that contributes most significantly to the integral, it follows that the integral for the parabolic barrier will be larger than for the Eckart barrier.\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{P}}  I_{\\mathrm{E}} $$\nThis leads to $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{P}}  \\gamma_{\\mathrm{E}}$, which in turn implies:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{P}}  T_{\\mathrm{E}} $$\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the results from parts 1 and 2, we have the following ordering for the integrals and Gamow factors:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{R}}  I_{\\mathrm{P}}  I_{\\mathrm{E}} \\implies \\gamma_{\\mathrm{R}}  \\gamma_{\\mathrm{P}}  \\gamma_{\\mathrm{E}} $$\nSince the transmission probability is inversely related to the Gamow factor, the ordering for the transmission probabilities is:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{R}}  T_{\\mathrm{P}}  T_{\\mathrm{E}} $$\nThis can be rewritten as $T_{\\mathrm{E}}  T_{\\mathrm{P}}  T_{\\mathrm{R}}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n- **A. $T_{\\mathrm{E}}T_{\\mathrm{P}}T_{\\mathrm{R}}$**: This ordering matches our derived result. The transmission is highest for the 'thinnest' effective barrier (Eckart) and lowest for the 'thickest' effective barrier (Rectangular). **Correct**.\n- **B. $T_{\\mathrm{R}}T_{\\mathrm{P}}T_{\\mathrm{E}}$**: This is the reverse of the correct ordering. It would imply that the rectangular barrier is the most transparent, which contradicts the fundamental principle that a wider/higher barrier is harder to tunnel through. **Incorrect**.\n- **C. $T_{\\mathrm{P}}T_{\\mathrm{E}}T_{\\mathrm{R}}$**: This option correctly identifies the rectangular barrier as the least transparent but incorrectly orders the parabolic and Eckart barriers. Our analysis showed the Eckart barrier to be more transparent than the parabolic one. **Incorrect**.\n- **D. $T_{\\mathrm{E}}=T_{\\mathrm{P}}=T_{\\mathrm{R}}$**: This would only be true if the functions $\\sqrt{V_i(x)-E}$ were identical for all three barriers, which is demonstrably false.

Within each slice $j$, spanning the interval $[x_{j-1}, x_j]$ where $x_j = x_L + j\\Delta x$, the potential is held constant at $V_j = V(x_{j-1} + \\Delta x/2)$.\n\nIn slice $j$, the TISE takes the form of a simple harmonic oscillator equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\psi_j(x)}{dx^2} + k_j^2 \\psi_j(x) = 0\n$$\nwhere $k_j^2 = 2(E - V_j)$ is the square of the local wave number. The nature of the solution depends on the sign of $k_j^2$:\n1.  If $E  V_j$, $k_j = \\sqrt{2(E - V_j)}$ is real. The solution is oscillatory, representing propagating waves: $\\psi_j(x) = A_j e^{i k_j x} + B_j e^{-i k_j x}$.\n2.  If $E  V_j$, $k_j = i\\sqrt{2(V_j - E)} \\equiv i\\kappa_j$ is purely imaginary, with $\\kappa_j$ real. The solution is exponential, representing evanescent (non-propagating) waves: $\\psi_j(x) = A_j e^{-\\kappa_j x} + B_j e^{\\kappa_j x}$.\n\nTo solve the system across the entire domain, we employ the transfer matrix method. Instead of tracking the coefficients $(A_j, B_j)$, which can be numerically unstable, we propagate the state vector $\\mathbf{S}(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\psi(x) \\\\ \\psi'(x) \\end{pmatrix}$, where $\\psi'(x) = d\\psi/dx$. The continuity of $\\psi(x)$ and $\\psi'(x)$ at the interfaces between slices is naturally preserved by this method.\n\nWithin slice $j$, we need a matrix $\\mathbf{P}_j$ that relates the state at the end of the slice, $\\mathbf{S}(x_j)$, to the state at the beginning, $\\mathbf{S}(x_{j-1})$: $\\mathbf{S}(x_j) = \\mathbf{P}_j \\mathbf{S}(x_{j-1})$.\nThe general solution in slice $j$ can be written as $\\psi(x) = C \\cos(k_j(x-x_{j-1})) + D \\sin(k_j(x-x_{j-1}))$. At $x=x_{j-1}$, we have $\\psi(x_{j-1}) = C$ and $\\psi'(x_{j-1}) = D k_j$, which allows us to express $C$ and $D$ in terms of the initial state vector. Evaluating $\\psi(x)$ and $\\psi'(x)$ at $x=x_j=x_{j-1}+\\Delta x$ yields the propagation matrix $\\mathbf{P}_j$.\n\nCase 1: $E  V_j$ ($k_j$ real and non-zero)\nThe solution is oscillatory. The propagation matrix is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}_j = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(k_j \\Delta x)  \\frac{1}{k_j}\\sin(k_j \\Delta x) \\\\ -k_j \\sin(k_j \\Delta x)  \\cos(k_j \\Delta x) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nCase 2: $E  V_j$ ($\\kappa_j$ real and non-zero)\nThe solution is exponential. Using $\\cos(iy) = \\cosh(y)$ and $\\sin(iy) = i\\sinh(y)$, the propagation matrix becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}_j = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh(\\kappa_j \\Delta x)  \\frac{1}{\\kappa_j}\\sinh(\\kappa_j \\Delta x) \\\\ \\kappa_j \\sinh(\\kappa_j \\Delta x)  \\cosh(\\kappa_j \\Delta x) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nCase 3: $E = V_j$ ($k_j=0$)\nThe TISE simplifies to $\\psi''(x)=0$, with solution $\\psi(x) = Ax+B$. The propagation matrix is the limit of Case 1 as $k_j \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}_j = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\Delta x \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe state at the right boundary $x_R=x_N$ is related to the state at the left boundary $x_L=x_0$ by the product of all slice propagation matrices:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}(x_R) = (\\mathbf{P}_N \\mathbf{P}_{N-1} \\cdots \\mathbf{P}_1) \\mathbf{S}(x_L) \\equiv \\mathbf{P}_{total} \\mathbf{S}(x_L)\n$$\nThe problem specifies scattering boundary conditions. We assume the potential is zero outside the domain $[x_L, x_R]$.\n-   In the left lead ($x \\leq x_L$), the wavefunction is a superposition of an incident wave with unit amplitude and a reflected wave: $\\psi_L(x) = e^{ik_0 x} + r e^{-ik_0 x}$, where $k_0 = \\sqrt{2E}$.\n-   In the right lead ($x \\geq x_R$), there is only a transmitted wave: $\\psi_R(x) = t e^{ik_0 x}$.\n\nFrom these forms, we determine the state vectors at the boundaries:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}(x_L) = \\begin{pmatrix} e^{ik_0 x_L} + r e^{-ik_0 x_L} \\\\ ik_0(e^{ik_0 x_L} - r e^{-ik_0 x_L}) \\end{pmatrix} \\quad , \\quad \\mathbf{S}(x_R) = t \\begin{pmatrix} e^{ik_0 x_R} \\\\ ik_0 e^{ik_0 x_R} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the relation $\\mathbf{S}(x_R) = \\mathbf{P}_{total} \\mathbf{S}(x_L)$ gives a system of two linear equations for the unknown complex amplitudes $r$ and $t$. Let $\\mathbf{P}_{total} = \\begin{pmatrix} P_{11}  P_{12} \\\\ P_{21}  P_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$. Solving this system for the transmission amplitude $t$ yields:\n$$\nt = \\frac{-2ik_0 e^{-ik_0(x_R-x_L)}}{ (P_{21} - k_0^2 P_{12}) - i k_0 (P_{11} + P_{22}) }\n$$\nThe transmission coefficient $T$ is defined as the ratio of the transmitted probability current to the incident probability current. The probability current for a stationary state is $j(x) = \\frac{1}{2i}(\\psi^* \\psi' - \\psi \\psi'^*)$.\n-   Incident current: $j_{inc} = k_0$ (for incident wave $e^{ik_0 x}$).\n-   Transmitted current: $j_{trans} = |t|^2 k_0$ (for transmitted wave $t e^{ik_0 x}$).\nThe transmission coefficient is therefore $T = j_{trans}/j_{inc} = |t|^2$.\nUsing the expression for $t$, and noting that the propagation matrices $\\mathbf{P}_j$ are real, we find:\n$$\nT = |t|^2 = \\frac{4k_0^2}{|(P_{21} - k_0^2 P_{12}) - i k_0 (P_{11} + P_{22})|^2} = \\frac{4k_0^2}{(P_{21} - k_0^2 P_{12})^2 + k_0^2(P_{11} + P_{22})^2}\n$$\nThis formula allows for a direct computation of the transmission coefficient.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, define the energy $E$ and the potential function $V(x)$.\n2.  Set up the spatial grid and calculate the constant potential $V_j$ for each of the $N$ slices.\n3.  Calculate the free-space wave number $k_0 = \\sqrt{2E}$.\n4.  Initialize the total propagation matrix $\\mathbf{P}_{total}$ to the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n5.  Iterate through each slice $j=1, \\ldots, N$. In each iteration, compute the slice matrix $\\mathbf{P}_j$ based on the sign of $2(E-V_j)$ and update the total matrix by left-multiplication: $\\mathbf{P}_{total} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{P}_j \\, \\mathbf{P}_{total}$.\n6.  After iterating through all slices, extract the four elements of the final $\\mathbf{P}_{total}$.\n7.  Use the derived formula for $T$ to calculate the transmission coefficient.\nThis procedure will be implemented for all four test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the four test cases for quantum tunneling.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def calculate_transmission(params):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the transmission coefficient for a single set of parameters.\n        The method uses the transfer matrix approach for the state vector (psi, psi').\n        \"\"\"\n        x_L, x_R, N, E, V_func = params\n        dx = (x_R - x_L) / N\n\n        if E = 0:\n            return 0.0\n        \n        k0 = np.sqrt(2 * E)\n\n        # Initialize the total propagation matrix\n        P_total = np.identity(2, dtype=np.float64)\n\n        # Define grid midpoints for potential evaluation\n        x_mids = x_L + dx / 2.0 + np.arange(N) * dx\n        \n        # Create an array of potential values for each slice\n        V_slices = V_func(x_mids)\n\n        # The total propagation matrix is P_N * P_{N-1} * ... * P_1\n        # Loop computes P_1, then P_2*P_1, then P_3*P_2*P_1, etc.\n        for i in range(N):\n            V = V_slices[i]\n            k_squared = 2 * (E - V)\n            \n            # This is the matrix for the i-th slice (P_{i+1} in formula)\n            P_slice = np.empty((2, 2), dtype=np.float64)\n\n            # E  V: Propagating region\n            if k_squared  0:\n                k = np.sqrt(k_squared)\n                # Handle k - 0 case for numerical stability\n                if np.abs(k * dx)  1e-9:\n                    P_slice[0, 0] = 1.0\n                    P_slice[0, 1] = dx\n                    P_slice[1, 0] = 0.0\n                    P_slice[1, 1] = 1.0\n                else:\n                    c = np.cos(k * dx)\n                    s = np.sin(k * dx)\n                    P_slice[0, 0] = c\n                    P_slice[0, 1] = s / k\n                    P_slice[1, 0] = -k * s\n                    P_slice[1, 1] = c\n            # E  V: Evanescent region\n            else:\n                kappa = np.sqrt(-k_squared)\n                # Handle kappa - 0 case (same as k - 0)\n                if np.abs(kappa * dx)  1e-9:\n                    P_slice[0, 0] = 1.0\n                    P_slice[0, 1] = dx\n                    P_slice[1, 0] = 0.0\n                    P_slice[1, 1] = 1.0\n                else:\n                    ch = np.cosh(kappa * dx)\n                    sh = np.sinh(kappa * dx)\n                    P_slice[0, 0] = ch\n                    P_slice[0, 1] = sh / kappa\n                    P_slice[1, 0] = kappa * sh\n                    P_slice[1, 1] = ch\n            \n            # Left-multiply to build P_i * P_{i-1} * ...\n            P_total = P_slice @ P_total\n\n        # Extract elements of the total propagation matrix\n        P11, P12, P21, P22 = P_total.flatten()\n        \n        # Calculate transmission coefficient T using the derived formula\n        denominator = (P21 - k0**2 * P12)**2 + (k0 * (P11 + P22))**2\n        \n        if denominator == 0:\n            # Should not happen for k0  0, but as a safeguard\n            return 1.0  # Physical limit for resonance\n\n        T = 4 * k0**2 / denominator\n        return T\n\n    # Common parameters for all test cases\n    x_L = -10.0\n    x_R = 10.0\n    N = 4000\n\n    # Test Case A: Single rectangular barrier, sub-barrier energy\n    V0_A = 0.5\n    a_A = 2.0\n    E_A = 0.2\n    V_func_A = lambda x: np.where(np.abs(x) = a_A / 2.0, V0_A, 0.0)\n    case_A = (x_L, x_R, N, E_A, V_func_A)\n\n    # Test Case B: Single rectangular barrier, high energy\n    V0_B = 0.5\n    a_B = 2.0\n    E_B = 2.0\n    V_func_B = lambda x: np.where(np.abs(x) = a_B / 2.0, V0_B, 0.0)\n    case_B = (x_L, x_R, N, E_B, V_func_B)\n\n    # Test Case C: No barrier, free propagation\n    E_C = 0.3\n    V_func_C = lambda x: np.zeros_like(x)\n    case_C = (x_L, x_R, N, E_C, V_func_C)\n\n    # Test Case D: Double barrier with a resonant well\n    V0_D = 0.6\n    b_D = 0.5\n    Lw_D = 4.0\n    E_D = 0.31\n    def V_func_D(x):\n        abs_x = np.abs(x)\n        return np.where((abs_x = Lw_D / 2.0)  (abs_x = Lw_D / 2.0 + b_D), V0_D, 0.0)\n    case_D = (x_L, x_R, N, E_D, V_func_D)\n\n    test_cases = [case_A, case_B, case_C, case_D]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        result = calculate_transmission(case)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Format the final output string as required\n    formatted_results = [f\"{r:.6f}\" for r in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2461151"}]}
