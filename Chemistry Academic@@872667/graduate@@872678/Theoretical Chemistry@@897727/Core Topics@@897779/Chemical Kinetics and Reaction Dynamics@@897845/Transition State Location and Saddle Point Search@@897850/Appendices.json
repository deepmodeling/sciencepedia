A stationary point is a point $(x,y)$ where the gradient of the potential, $\\nabla V(x,y)$, is zero. The classification of a stationary point depends on the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, $H(x,y)$, evaluated at that point. The Morse index is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian.\n\nThe potential energy surface is given by:\n$$V(x,y) = x^{4} + y^{4} - 2x^{2} + xy$$\n\nFirst, we compute the gradient vector $\\nabla V(x,y)$, which is composed of the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = 4x^{3} - 4x + y $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = 4y^{3} + x $$\nThe gradient vector is:\n$$ \\nabla V(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4x^{3} - 4x + y \\\\ 4y^{3} + x \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we compute the Hessian matrix $H(x,y)$ of second partial derivatives.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} V}{\\partial x^{2}} = 12x^{2} - 4 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} V}{\\partial y^{2}} = 12y^{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} V}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} V}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 1 $$\nThe Hessian matrix is:\n$$ H(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 12x^{2} - 4 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 12y^{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nTo find the stationary points, we set the gradient vector to the zero vector, $\\nabla V(x,y) = \\mathbf{0}$. This yields a system of two nonlinear equations:\n$$ (1) \\quad 4x^{3} - 4x + y = 0 $$\n$$ (2) \\quad 4y^{3} + x = 0 $$\n\nFrom equation (2), we can express $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = -4y^{3}$.\nAlternatively, we can express $y$ from equation (1): $y = 4x - 4x^{3}$.\nLet us substitute the expression for $y$ from (1) into (2):\n$$ 4(4x - 4x^{3})^{3} + x = 0 $$\n$$ 4[4x(1 - x^{2})]^{3} + x = 0 $$\n$$ 4(64x^{3})(1 - x^{2})^{3} + x = 0 $$\n$$ 256x^{3}(1 - x^{2})^{3} + x = 0 $$\nFactor out $x$:\n$$ x[256x^{2}(1 - x^{2})^{3} + 1] = 0 $$\nThis equation gives two possibilities for the solutions.\nCase A: $x = 0$. Substituting this into equation (2) gives $4y^{3} = 0$, which implies $y=0$. Thus, one stationary point is $(0,0)$.\n\nCase B: $256x^{2}(1 - x^{2})^{3} + 1 = 0$. Let $u = x^{2}$. Since $x$ is real, $u \\ge 0$. The equation becomes:\n$$ 256u(1 - u)^{3} + 1 = 0 $$\nLet $f(u) = 256u(1-u)^{3} + 1$. We need to find the number of positive roots of this function.\nLet's analyze $f(u)$ for $u \\ge 0$.\nThe derivative is $f'(u) = 256(1-u)^{3} + 256u \\cdot 3(1-u)^{2}(-1) = 256(1-u)^{2}[(1-u) - 3u] = 256(1-u)^{2}(1-4u)$.\nFor $u \\ge 0$, $f'(u) = 0$ when $u=1$ or $u=1/4$.\nThe behavior of $f(u)$ is as follows:\n- At $u=0$, $f(0) = 1$.\n- For $0 < u < 1/4$, $f'(u) > 0$, so $f(u)$ is increasing.\n- At $u=1/4$, $f(u)$ has a local maximum: $f(1/4) = 256(1/4)(3/4)^{3} + 1 = 64(27/64)+1 = 28$.\n- For $1/4 < u < 1$, $f'(u) < 0$, so $f(u)$ is decreasing.\n- At $u=1$, $f(1) = 256(1)(0)^{3} + 1 = 1$.\n- For $u > 1$, $f'(u) < 0$, so $f(u)$ continues to decrease. As $u \\to \\infty$, $f(u) \\approx -256u^{4} \\to -\\infty$.\nSince $f(1)=1$ and $f(u)$ is continuous and decreases towards $-\\infty$ for $u>1$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be exactly one root $u_{0}$ such that $u_{0} > 1$.\nIn the interval $[0,1]$, $f(u)$ is strictly positive, with a minimum value of $1$ at $u=0$ and $u=1$.\nThus, there is only one positive root $u_{0}$ for $f(u)=0$.\nThis single value $u_{0}$ for $x^{2}$ gives two real values for $x$: $x_{0} = \\sqrt{u_{0}}$ and $-x_{0} = -\\sqrt{u_{0}}$.\nFor each $x$, the corresponding $y$ is found from $y=4x-4x^{3}$.\nFor $x_{0}$, we have $y_{0} = 4x_{0} - 4x_{0}^{3}$.\nFor $-x_{0}$, we have $y = 4(-x_{0})-4(-x_{0})^{3} = -(4x_{0}-4x_{0}^{3}) = -y_{0}$.\nSo, in addition to $(0,0)$, we have two more stationary points: $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ and $(-x_{0}, -y_{0})$.\nIn total, there are three stationary points.\n\nNow we classify these points by evaluating the Hessian at each one.\n1. Stationary point $(0,0)$:\n$$ H(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 12(0)^{2} - 4 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 12(0)^{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of the Hessian is $\\det(H(0,0)) = (-4)(0) - (1)(1) = -1$.\nSince the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues ($\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2} = -1$), the eigenvalues must have opposite signs. One is positive, and one is negative. The number of negative eigenvalues, the Morse index, is $1$. Therefore, $(0,0)$ is a first-order saddle point.\n\n2. Stationary points $(\\pm x_{0}, \\pm y_{0})$:\nThe Hessian matrix depends on $x^{2}$ and $y^{2}$, so $H(x_{0}, y_{0}) = H(-x_{0}, -y_{0})$. We can analyze them together.\nThe trace of the Hessian is $\\mathrm{Tr}(H) = 12x_{0}^{2} - 4 + 12y_{0}^{2}$. Since $x_{0}^{2} = u_{0} > 1$, the term $12x_{0}^{2} - 4 > 12(1) - 4 = 8 > 0$. And $12y_{0}^{2} > 0$ because $y_{0} \\neq 0$ (if $y_{0}=0$, then $x_{0}=0$, contradicting $x_{0}^{2} > 1$). Thus, $\\mathrm{Tr}(H) > 0$.\nThe determinant of the Hessian is $\\det(H) = (12x_{0}^{2} - 4)(12y_{0}^{2}) - 1$.\nTo simplify this, we use the relations from the stationary point conditions.\nFrom $x = -4y^{3}$, we have $x/y = -4y^{2}$ (since $y_0 \\neq 0$).\nFrom $y = 4x - 4x^{3}$, we have $y/x = 4-4x^{2}$ (since $x_0 \\neq 0$), so $12x^{2}-4 = 8-3y/x$.\nSubstitute these into the determinant formula:\n$$ \\det(H) = (8 - 3y/x)(-3x/y) - 1 = -24x/y + 9 - 1 = -24x/y + 8 $$\nNow substitute $x/y = -4y^2$:\n$$ \\det(H) = -24(-4y^2) + 8 = 96y^2 + 8 $$\nAt the points $(\\pm x_{0}, \\pm y_{0})$, $y_{0} \\neq 0$, so $y_{0}^{2} > 0$.\nTherefore, $\\det(H) = 96y_{0}^{2} + 8 > 8 > 0$.\nSince $\\mathrm{Tr}(H) > 0$ and $\\det(H) > 0$, both eigenvalues of the Hessian must be positive.\nThe Morse index is $0$. Therefore, the points $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ and $(-x_{0}, -y_{0})$ are both local minima.\n\nIn summary, the potential energy surface $V(x,y)$ has three stationary points:\n- One first-order saddle point at $(0,0)$ (Morse index $1$).\n- Two local minima at $(\\pm x_{0}, \\pm y_{0})$ (Morse index $0$).\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of first-order saddle points.

The $a$-th component of the gradient with respect to mass-weighted coordinates, $\\tilde{g}_a(Q)$, is given by the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial Q_a}$.

In matrix notation, this is $\\tilde{g} = (M^{-1/2})^T g$. The mass matrix $M$ is diagonal by definition. Its square root $M^{1/2}$ and inverse square root $M^{-1/2}$ are also diagonal and therefore symmetric. Thus, $(M^{-1/2})^T = M^{-1/2}$. The gradient transformation is:\n$$\n\\tilde{g}(Q) = M^{-1/2} g(x(Q))\n$$\nNext, we derive the transformation for the Hessian matrix.
