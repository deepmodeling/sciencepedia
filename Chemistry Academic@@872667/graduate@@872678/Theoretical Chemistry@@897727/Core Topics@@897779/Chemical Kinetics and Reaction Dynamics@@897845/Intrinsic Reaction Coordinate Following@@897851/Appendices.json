The definition of the IRC as the steepest-descent path in mass-weighted coordinates is standard. All provided information is self-contained and consistent. No scientific or logical flaws are identified. The problem is therefore deemed **valid** and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) is defined as the path of steepest descent on the potential energy surface, traced in mass-weighted coordinates.
