The Coulomb integral $H_{11}(R)$ and the resonance integral $H_{12}(R)$ are both negative quantities for stable bonding configurations. The overlap integral $S_{12}(R)$ is positive and less than $1$. The bonding orbital corresponds to the lower energy. Since $H_{12}(R)$ is negative, adding it to $H_{11}(R)$ in the numerator of $\\varepsilon_2$ makes the energy more negative (lower). Conversely, subtracting the negative $H_{12}(R)$ in the numerator of $\\varepsilon_1$ makes the energy less negative (higher).\nTherefore, the bonding orbital energy, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{bonding}}$, is $\\varepsilon_2$, and the antibonding orbital energy, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{antibonding}}$, is $\\varepsilon_1$.\n\nBonding orbital energy ($\\sigma_g$):\n$$\n\\varepsilon_g(R) = \\frac{H_{11}(R) + H_{12}(R)}{1 + S_{12}(R)}\n$$\nAntibonding orbital energy ($\\sigma_u^*$):\n$$\n\\varepsilon_u(R) = \\frac{H_{11}(R) - H_{12}(R)}{1 - S_{12}(R)}\n$$\nThese are the analytical expressions for the two orbital energies as required.

Symmetry-Adapted Linear Combinations (SALCs) and Symmetry of Atomic Orbitals**\n\nFirst, we determine the irreducible representations spanned by the basis of the three hydrogen $1s$ orbitals, which we denote as $\\{\\psi_1, \\psi_2, \\psi_3\\}$. We apply the symmetry operations of the $C_{3v}$ group and find the trace (character) of the resulting transformation matrix. The operations in $C_{3v}$ are the identity ($E$), two rotations by $\\pm 2\\pi/3$ ($2C_3$), and three vertical reflection planes ($3\\sigma_v$).\n-   $\\hat{E}$ leaves all three orbitals unchanged: $\\chi(E) = 3$.\n-   $\\hat{C_3}$ permutes all three orbitals, so none are left in their original position: $\\chi(C_3) = 0$.\n-   A $\\hat{\\sigma_v}$ plane passes through the nitrogen atom and one hydrogen atom (e.g., $\\mathrm{H_1}$), leaving its orbital $\\psi_1$ unchanged, while swapping the other two ($\\psi_2 \\leftrightarrow \\psi_3$): $\\chi(\\sigma_v) = 1$.\nThe resulting reducible representation is $\\Gamma_{1s} = (3, 0, 1)$.\n\nTo decompose $\\Gamma_{1s}$ into its irreducible representation components ($A_1$, $A_2$, $E$), we use the reduction formula $n_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_R \\chi_i(R)^* \\chi(R)$, where $h=6$ is the order of the group and $\\chi_i(R)$ are characters from the $C_{3v}$ character table.\n-   $n_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{6} [1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0 + 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1] = \\frac{1}{6}(3+3) = 1$.\n-   $n_{A_2} = \\frac{1}{6} [1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0 + 3 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 1] = \\frac{1}{6}(3-3) = 0$.\n-   $n_{E} = \\frac{1}{6} [1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 0 + 3 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 1] = \\frac{1}{6}(6) = 1$.\nThus, the combination of the three hydrogen $1s$ orbitals gives rise to SALCs of $A_1$ and $E$ symmetry: $\\Gamma_{1s} = A_1 \\oplus E$.\n\nWe construct the SALCs using the projection operator formalism, $\\hat{P}^{(i)} = \\frac{l_i}{h} \\sum_R \\chi_i(R)^* \\hat{R}$.\nFor the $A_1$ SALC, we project onto $\\psi_1$:\n$\\hat{P}^{(A_1)}\\psi_1 \\propto (\\hat{E} + \\hat{C_3} + \\hat{C_3^2} + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v1} + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v2} + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v3})\\psi_1 = \\psi_1 + \\psi_2 + \\psi_3 + \\psi_1 + \\psi_3 + \\psi_2 \\propto \\psi_1 + \\psi_2 + \\psi_3$.\nAssuming the atomic orbitals form an orthonormal set ($\\langle \\psi_i | \\psi_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$), the normalization constant is $N = (\\langle (\\psi_1+\\psi_2+\\psi_3) | (\\psi_1+\\psi_2+\\psi_3) \\rangle)^{-1/2} = (1+1+1)^{-1/2} = 1/\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe normalized $A_1$ SALC is $\\phi_H^{(A_1)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(\\psi_1 + \\psi_2 + \\psi_3)$.\n\nFor the $E$ SALCs, we project $\\psi_1$ using $\\hat{P}^{(E)}$:\n$\\hat{P}^{(E)}\\psi_1 \\propto (2\\hat{E} - \\hat{C_3} - \\hat{C_3^2})\\psi_1 = 2\\psi_1 - \\psi_2 - \\psi_3$.\nNormalizing this gives the first $E$ SALC: $\\phi_{Ea} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(2\\psi_1 - \\psi_2 - \\psi_3)$.\nA second SALC, orthogonal to both $\\phi_H^{(A_1)}$ and $\\phi_{Ea}$, can be constructed. By inspection, the combination $\\psi_2 - \\psi_3$ is orthogonal to $\\phi_H^{(A_1)}$ and $\\phi_{Ea}$.\nNormalizing gives the second $E$ SALC: $\\phi_{Eb} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\psi_2 - \\psi_3)$.\nThe pair $\\{\\phi_{Ea}, \\phi_{Eb}\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for the $E$ representation.\n\nThe nitrogen atomic orbitals are centered on the principal axis. Their symmetries are determined by their transformation properties:\n-   The $2s$ orbital is spherically symmetric and remains unchanged under all operations: symmetry $A_1$.\n-   The $2p_z$ orbital is aligned with the $C_3$ axis ($z$-axis) and is also unchanged by any group operation: symmetry $A_1$.\n-   The $(2p_x, 2p_y)$ orbitals lie in the $xy$-plane and transform as the $(x, y)$ coordinates in the character table: symmetry $E$.\n\n**2. Block Diagonalization of Fock and Overlap Matrices**\n\nThe Roothaan-Hall equations are written in matrix form as $\\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{C}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\mathbf{F}$ is the Fock matrix and $\\mathbf{S}$ is the overlap matrix. The molecular Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}$, and by extension the effective one-electron Fock operator, $\\hat{F}$, must be totally symmetric under all operations of the molecular point group.\nThe Great Orthogonality Theorem of group theory states that the matrix element of a totally symmetric operator between two functions that belong to different irreducible representations is zero. That is, $\\langle \\phi^{(i)} | \\hat{A} | \\phi^{(j)} \\rangle = 0$ if $i \\neq j$, for $\\hat{A}$ being totally symmetric.\nSince both $\\hat{F}$ and the identity operator (for the overlap matrix $\\mathbf{S}$) are totally symmetric, their matrix representations will have zero elements between basis functions of different symmetries. By choosing our basis set to be the SALCs, which are basis functions for the irreducible representations $A_1$ and $E$, the $\\mathbf{F}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$ matrices become block-diagonal.\nThe basis for the $A_1$ block is composed of all basis functions of $A_1$ symmetry: $\\{\\chi_{2s}, \\chi_{2p_z}, \\phi_H^{(A_1)}\\}$.\nThe basis for the $E$ block is composed of all basis functions of $E$ symmetry: $\\{\\chi_{2p_x}, \\chi_{2p_y}, \\phi_{Ea}, \\phi_{Eb}\\}$.\nThe full matrices thus separate into an $A_1$ block and an $E$ block:\n$$ \\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{F}_{A_1} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{F}_{E} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{S}_{A_1} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{S}_{E} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis simplifies the problem, as each block can be diagonalized independently.\n\n**3. & 4. Construction and Solution of the $A_1$ Block Fock Matrix**\n\nThe problem states to assume the basis has been orthonormalized such that $\\mathbf{S}=\\mathbf{I}$. This reduces the generalized eigenvalue problem to a standard one, $\\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{C}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. We construct the $3 \\times 3$ Fock matrix $\\mathbf{F}_{A_1}$ for the $A_1$ block using the basis $\\{\\chi_{2s}, \\chi_{2p_z}, \\phi_H^{(A_1)}\\}$. The matrix elements $F_{ij} = \\langle \\chi_i | \\hat{F} | \\chi_j \\rangle$ are determined from the given parameters:\n-   $F_{11} = \\langle \\chi_{2s} | \\hat{F} | \\chi_{2s} \\rangle = \\alpha_s = -26.00$ eV.\n-   $F_{22} = \\langle \\chi_{2p_z} | \\hat{F} | \\chi_{2p_z} \\rangle = \\alpha_p = -13.40$ eV.\n-   $F_{33} = \\langle \\phi_H^{(A_1)} | \\hat{F} | \\phi_H^{(A_1)} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{3}\\langle (\\psi_1+\\psi_2+\\psi_3) | \\hat{F} | (\\psi_1+\\psi_2+\\psi_3) \\rangle$.

Express the final numerical value of $\\langle \\hat{S}^{2} \\rangle$ as a pure number (no units), and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a general expression for the expectation value of the total spin-squared operator, $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$, for a single Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) Slater determinant. This expression will then be used to calculate $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$ for a specific five-electron system and to discuss the conditions under which a UHF solution becomes equivalent to a Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) solution.\n\nA UHF Slater determinant for a system of $N$ electrons is constructed from a set of $N$ orthonormal spin orbitals $\\{\\psi_p\\}_{p=1}^N$. For a collinear spin system with $N_\\alpha$ electrons of $\\alpha$ spin and $N_\\beta$ electrons of $\\beta$ spin ($N=N_\\alpha+N_\\beta$), the spin orbitals are of the form $\\psi_p(\\mathbf{x}) = \\phi_k(\\mathbf{r})\\sigma(\\omega)$, where $\\sigma$ is a spin function ($\\alpha$ or $\\beta$). In UHF, the spatial orbitals for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ electrons are different. The set of occupied spin orbitals is $\\{\\chi_i^\\alpha(\\mathbf{x})\\}_{i=1}^{N_\\alpha} \\cup \\{\\chi_j^\\beta(\\mathbf{x})\\}_{j=1}^{N_\\beta}$, where $\\chi_i^\\alpha = \\phi_i^\\alpha \\alpha$ and $\\chi_j^\\beta = \\phi_j^\\beta \\beta$. The sets of spatial orbitals $\\{\\phi_i^\\alpha\\}$ and $\\{\\phi_j^\\beta\\}$ are individually orthonormal, i.e., $\\langle\\phi_i^\\alpha|\\phi_k^\\alpha\\rangle = \\delta_{ik}$ and $\\langle\\phi_j^\\beta|\\phi_l^\\beta\\rangle = \\delta_{jl}$. However, orbitals from different sets are not generally orthogonal, $\\langle\\phi_i^\\alpha|\\phi_j^\\beta\\rangle = S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij} \\neq \\delta_{ij}$.\n\nThe total spin-squared operator $\\hat{S}^2$ is the sum of a one-electron part and a two-electron part:\n$$ \\hat{S}^2 = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^N \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_k\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\sum_{l=1}^N \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_l\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^N \\hat{s}_k^2 + \\sum_{k \\neq l} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_k \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_l $$\nThe expectation value of $\\hat{S}^2$ for the UHF determinant $\\Psi_{UHF}$ is $\\langle\\hat{S}^2\\rangle = \\langle\\Psi_{UHF}|\\hat{S}^2|\\Psi_{UHF}\\rangle$.\n\nThe expectation value of the one-electron part is straightforward. For any spin-$1/2$ particle, the operator $\\hat{s}^2$ has an eigenvalue of $s(s+1) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{2}+1) = \\frac{3}{4}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\left\\langle \\sum_{k=1}^N \\hat{s}_k^2 \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{k=1}^N \\left\\langle \\hat{s}_k^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{3}{4}N $$\n\nThe expectation value of the two-electron operator $\\hat{O}_2 = \\sum_{k \\neq l} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_k \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_l = \\sum_{k<l} 2(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_k \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_l)$ is found using the Slater-Condon rules. For a two-electron operator $\\hat{O}_2 = \\sum_{k<l}\\hat{o}_{kl}$, the expectation value is:\n$$ \\langle \\Psi | \\hat{O}_2 | \\Psi \\rangle = \\sum_{p<q} \\left[ \\langle \\psi_p \\psi_q | \\hat{o}_{12} | \\psi_p \\psi_q \\rangle - \\langle \\psi_p \\psi_q | \\hat{o}_{12} | \\psi_q \\psi_p \\rangle \\right] $$\nwhere the sum is over all distinct pairs of occupied spin orbitals. We can partition this sum based on the spin of the orbitals.\nLet $\\hat{o}_{12} = 2(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_2)$. We need the matrix elements of this operator for pairs of spin functions.\n1. Two $\\alpha$ spins: $\\langle \\alpha\\alpha | 2(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_2) | \\alpha\\alpha \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n2. Two $\\beta$ spins: $\\langle \\beta\\beta | 2(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_2) | \\beta\\beta \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n3. One $\\alpha$ and one $\\beta$ spin:\n   - Direct term: $\\langle \\alpha\\beta | 2(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_2) | \\alpha\\beta \\rangle = - \\frac{1}{2}$.\n   - Exchange term: $\\langle \\alpha\\beta | 2(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_2) | \\beta\\alpha \\rangle = 1$.\n\nWe now apply these to the three types of spin orbital pairs $(\\psi_p, \\psi_q)$:\n\nCase 1: Both orbitals have $\\alpha$ spin. Let $\\psi_p = \\chi_i^\\alpha$ and $\\psi_q = \\chi_k^\\alpha$. There are $\\binom{N_\\alpha}{2}$ such pairs.\nThe contribution from each pair is:\n$$ \\langle\\chi_i^\\alpha \\chi_k^\\alpha | \\hat{o}_{12} | \\chi_i^\\alpha \\chi_k^\\alpha\\rangle - \\langle\\chi_i^\\alpha \\chi_k^\\alpha | \\hat{o}_{12} | \\chi_k^\\alpha \\chi_i^\\alpha \\rangle = \\langle\\alpha\\alpha|\\hat{o}_{12}|\\alpha\\alpha\\rangle - |\\langle\\phi_i^\\alpha|\\phi_k^\\alpha\\rangle|^2 \\langle\\alpha\\alpha|\\hat{o}_{12}|\\alpha\\alpha\\rangle $$\nUsing $\\langle\\phi_i^\\alpha|\\phi_k^\\alpha\\rangle = \\delta_{ik}$ and $i \\neq k$, this simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2} - (0)^2\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe total contribution from all $\\alpha$-$\\alpha$ pairs is $\\binom{N_\\alpha}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{N_\\alpha(N_\\alpha-1)}{4}$.\n\nCase 2: Both orbitals have $\\beta$ spin. By symmetry, the total contribution is $\\binom{N_\\beta}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{N_\\beta(N_\\beta-1)}{4}$.\n\nCase 3: One orbital has $\\alpha$ spin and one has $\\beta$ spin. Let $\\psi_p = \\chi_i^\\alpha$ and $\\psi_q = \\chi_j^\\beta$. There are $N_\\alpha N_\\beta$ such pairs.\nThe contribution from each pair $(\\chi_i^\\alpha, \\chi_j^\\beta)$ is:\n$$ \\langle\\alpha\\beta|\\hat{o}_{12}|\\alpha\\beta\\rangle - |\\langle\\phi_i^\\alpha|\\phi_j^\\beta\\rangle|^2 \\langle\\alpha\\beta|\\hat{o}_{12}|\\beta\\alpha\\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2} - |S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2 \\cdot (1) = -\\frac{1}{2} - |S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2 $$\nThe total contribution from all $\\alpha$-$\\beta$ pairs is $\\sum_{i=1}^{N_\\alpha}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_\\beta} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} - |S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2\\right) = -\\frac{N_\\alpha N_\\beta}{2} - \\sum_{i=1}^{N_\\alpha}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_\\beta} |S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2$.\n\nCombining all contributions:\n$$ \\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{3}{4}N + \\frac{N_\\alpha(N_\\alpha-1)}{4} + \\frac{N_\\beta(N_\\beta-1)}{4} - \\frac{2N_\\alpha N_\\beta}{4} - \\sum_{i=1}^{N_\\alpha}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_\\beta}|S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2 $$\n$$ \\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{3(N_\\alpha+N_\\beta)}{4} + \\frac{N_\\alpha^2 - N_\\alpha + N_\\beta^2 - N_\\beta - 2N_\\alpha N_\\beta}{4} - \\sum_{i,j}|S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2 $$\n$$ \\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{3N_\\alpha+3N_\\beta + (N_\\alpha-N_\\beta)^2 - (N_\\alpha+N_\\beta)}{4} - \\sum_{i,j}|S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2 $$\nWith $M_S = \\frac{1}{2}(N_\\alpha-N_\\beta)$, we get $(N_\\alpha-N_\\beta)^2 = 4M_S^2$:\n$$ \\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{2(N_\\alpha+N_\\beta) + 4M_S^2}{4} - \\sum_{i,j}|S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2 = \\frac{N}{2} + M_S^2 - \\sum_{i,j}|S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2 $$\nThis can be rewritten in a more common form. Recognizing that $\\frac{N}{2}+M_S^2 = \\frac{N_\\alpha+N_\\beta}{2} + \\frac{(N_\\alpha-N_\\beta)^2}{4} = M_S(M_S+1)+N_\\beta$, we arrive at the general expression for $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle = M_S(M_S+1) + N_\\beta - \\sum_{i=1}^{N_\\alpha}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_\\beta}|S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2 $$\n\nNow, we evaluate this for the given system.\nThe givens are: $N_\\alpha=3$, $N_\\beta=2$, and the overlap matrix\n$$ S^{\\alpha\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.85 & 0.10 \\\\ 0.05 & 0.80 \\\\ 0.00 & 0.10 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFirst, we compute the necessary quantities:\nThe spin projection is $M_S = \\frac{1}{2}(N_\\alpha - N_\\beta) = \\frac{1}{2}(3-2) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe ideal spin-squared eigenvalue for a pure state with $S=M_S$ would be $S(S+1) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{2}+1) = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$.\nThe sum of squared overlaps is the sum of the squares of all elements of $S^{\\alpha\\beta}$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\sum_{j=1}^{2}|S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2 = (0.85)^2 + (0.10)^2 + (0.05)^2 + (0.80)^2 + (0.00)^2 + (0.10)^2 $$\n$$ = 0.7225 + 0.0100 + 0.0025 + 0.6400 + 0.0000 + 0.0100 = 1.3850 $$\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ \\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle = M_S(M_S+1) + N_\\beta - \\sum_{i,j}|S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2 = 0.75 + 2 - 1.3850 = 1.3650 $$\nThe resulting value for $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$ is $1.3650$, which is larger than the ideal value of $0.75$. This indicates that the UHF wavefunction is not a pure spin state but is contaminated by contributions from states with higher spin quantum numbers (e.g., $S=3/2$).\n\nFinally, we discuss the condition under which a UHF solution reduces to an RHF solution. In the RHF formalism for an open-shell system with $N_\\alpha > N_\\beta$, there are $N_\\beta$ doubly occupied orbitals and $N_\\alpha - N_\\beta$ singly occupied (alpha) orbitals. This imposes the constraint that the $N_\\beta$ spatial orbitals for the $\\beta$ electrons are identical to $N_\\beta$ of the spatial orbitals for the $\\alpha$ electrons.\nLet the $\\alpha$ orbitals be re-indexed such that $\\{\\phi_j^\\alpha\\}_{j=1}^{N_\\beta}$ are the doubly occupied ones and $\\{\\phi_i^\\alpha\\}_{i=N_\\beta+1}^{N_\\alpha}$ are the singly occupied ones. The RHF constraint is $\\phi_j^\\beta = \\phi_j^\\alpha$ for $j=1, \\dots, N_\\beta$.\nUnder this constraint, the overlap matrix elements $S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij} = \\langle\\phi_i^\\alpha|\\phi_j^\\beta\\rangle$ become $S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij} = \\langle\\phi_i^\\alpha|\\phi_j^\\alpha\\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$. This holds for $i \\in \\{1, ..., N_\\alpha\\}$ and $j \\in \\{1, ..., N_\\beta\\}$. Therefore, the overlap matrix $S^{\\alpha\\beta}$ would be a $N_\\alpha \\times N_\\beta$ matrix with a $N_\\beta \\times N_\\beta$ identity matrix as its top block and zeros below it.\nThe sum of squared overlaps then becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N_\\alpha}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_\\beta}|S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_\\alpha}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_\\beta}|\\delta_{ij}|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_\\beta} 1 = N_\\beta $$\nSubstituting this into our general expression for $\\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle \\hat{S}^2 \\rangle_{RHF} = M_S(M_S+1) + N_\\beta - N_\\beta = M_S(M_S+1) $$\nThis result shows that the RHF wavefunction is an eigenfunction of $\\hat{S}^2$ with eigenvalue $S(S+1)$ where $S=M_S$. The \"spin contamination\" term, $N_\\beta - \\sum |S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2$, becomes zero. Thus, the condition for a UHF solution to reduce to a high-spin RHF solution is that the set of occupied $\\beta$ spatial orbitals forms an orthonormal set that is a subset of the space spanned by the occupied $\\alpha$ spatial orbitals, leading to $\\sum_{i,j}|S^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ij}|^2 = N_\\beta$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.365}$$", "id": "2816320"}]}
