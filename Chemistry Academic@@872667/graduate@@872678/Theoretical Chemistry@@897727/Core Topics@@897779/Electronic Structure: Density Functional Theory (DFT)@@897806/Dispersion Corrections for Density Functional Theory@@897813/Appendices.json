Each sphere’s negative electron charge is exactly neutralized by a uniform positive background of equal magnitude occupying the same sphere, so the total charge density of each isolated sphere is spherically symmetric and integrates to zero. The sphere centers are fixed on the $z$-axis at positions $-R/2$ and $+R/2$, respectively, with $R > 2a$, so that the electronic densities are nonoverlapping. Let $n_{A}(\\mathbf{r})$ and $n_{B}(\\mathbf{r})$ denote the ground-state Kohn–Sham electron densities of the isolated spheres, and assume that, upon bringing the spheres to separation $R$ subject to the constraint $R > 2a$, the densities remain unchanged and strictly supported on disjoint regions, that is, $n_{A}(\\mathbf{r}) n_{B}(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$ for all $\\mathbf{r}$.\n\nWork within Kohn–Sham density functional theory, and take the exchange–correlation energy to be described by the semilocal Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation.

We analyze the contribution of each term to $\\Delta E(R)$ under the problem's stated conditions.\n\n$1$. Kinetic Energy Contribution ($\\Delta T_s$):\nThe problem assumes that the total density is $n = n_A + n_B$ and that the individual densities have disjoint support, i.e., $n_A(\\mathbf{r})n_B(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$ for all $\\mathbf{r}$. For a system of non-interacting fermions, the total kinetic energy of a system composed of two non-overlapping subsystems is the sum of their individual kinetic energies. The set of Kohn-Sham orbitals for the combined system is simply the union of the orbitals for system $A$ and system $B$. Therefore,\n$$\nT_s[n_A + n_B] = T_s[n_A] + T_s[n_B]\n$$\nThe contribution to the interaction energy from the kinetic term is thus zero:\n$$\n\\Delta T_s = T_s[n_A + n_B] - T_s[n_A] - T_s[n_B] = 0\n$$\n\n$2$. Exchange–Correlation Energy Contribution ($\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}$):\nThe PBE functional is a semilocal generalized gradient approximation (GGA), with an energy density that depends only on the local electron density $n(\\mathbf{r})$ and its gradient $\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})$. The functional form is $E_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n] = \\int \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{xc}}(n(\\mathbf{r}), \\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})) \\,\\mathrm{d}^{3}\\mathbf{r}$. Given the non-overlapping nature of the densities $n_A$ and $n_B$, the integral over all space can be decomposed into integrals over the disjoint regions where each density is non-zero.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n_A+n_B] = \\int \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{xc}}(n_A(\\mathbf{r})+n_B(\\mathbf{r}), \\nabla (n_A(\\mathbf{r})+n_B(\\mathbf{r}))) \\,\\mathrm{d}^{3}\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nIn the region where $n_A(\\mathbf{r}) \\neq 0$, we have $n_B(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$, so the integrand becomes $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{xc}}(n_A(\\mathbf{r}), \\nabla n_A(\\mathbf{r}))$. Similarly, where $n_B(\\mathbf{r}) \\neq 0$, the integrand is $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{xc}}(n_B(\\mathbf{r}), \\nabla n_B(\\mathbf{r}))$. Therefore,\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n_A+n_B] = \\int_{\\text{supp}(n_A)} \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{xc}}(n_A, \\nabla n_A) \\,\\mathrm{d}^{3}\\mathbf{r} + \\int_{\\text{supp}(n_B)} \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{xc}}(n_B, \\nabla n_B) \\,\\mathrm{d}^{3}\\mathbf{r} = E_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n_A] + E_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n_B]\n$$\nThe exchange–correlation contribution to the interaction energy is also strictly zero:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}} = E_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n_A + n_B] - E_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n_A] - E_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n_B] = 0\n$$\n\n$3$. Classical Coulomb Energy Contribution ($\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Coulomb}}$):\nThis is the only remaining term. The total charge densities for the isolated spheres are $\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},A} = \\rho_{b,A} - n_A$ and $\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},B} = \\rho_{b,B} - n_B$. The total charge density of the combined system is $\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},AB} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},A} + \\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},B}$.\nThe Coulombic part of the interaction energy is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Coulomb}} = E_{\\mathrm{Coulomb}}[n_A+n_B] - E_{\\mathrm{Coulomb}}[n_A] - E_{\\mathrm{Coulomb}}[n_B]\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of the Coulomb energy:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Coulomb}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\iint \\frac{(\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},A}+\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},B})(\\mathbf{r})(\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},A}+\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},B})(\\mathbf{r}')}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r} \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}' - \\frac{1}{2}\\iint \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},A}(\\mathbf{r})\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},A}(\\mathbf{r}')}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r} \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}' - \\frac{1}{2}\\iint \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},B}(\\mathbf{r})\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},B}(\\mathbf{r}')}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r} \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}'\n$$\nExpanding the first term reveals the self-energies of $A$ and $B$, which cancel, leaving only the cross term:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Coulomb}} = \\iint \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},A}(\\mathbf{r})\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},B}(\\mathbf{r}')}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r} \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}'\n$$\nThis is the classical electrostatic interaction energy between the charge distribution of sphere $A$ and that of sphere $B$. We are given that each isolated sphere is neutral and spherically symmetric.\nA fundamental theorem of electrostatics, given as a premise, states that the electrostatic potential outside a neutral, spherically symmetric charge distribution is identically zero. Sphere $A$ has its charge distribution $\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},A}(\\mathbf{r})$ contained within a radius $a$ of its center at $\\mathbf{z} = -R/2$. Sphere $B$ has its charge distribution $\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},B}(\\mathbf{r}')$ contained within a radius $a$ of its center at $\\mathbf{z} = +R/2$.\nThe interaction energy can be written as the energy of charge distribution $B$ in the potential produced by $A$:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Coulomb}} = \\int \\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},B}(\\mathbf{r}') V_A(\\mathbf{r}')\\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}' \\quad \\text{where} \\quad V_A(\\mathbf{r}') = \\int \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},A}(\\mathbf{r})}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} \\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nThe condition $R > 2a$ ensures that the spheres do not overlap. This means that for any point $\\mathbf{r}'$ where $\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},B}(\\mathbf{r}')$ is non-zero (i.e., inside sphere $B$), that point $\\mathbf{r}'$ lies outside the support of the charge distribution of sphere $A$.\nAccording to the electrostatic theorem, the potential $V_A(\\mathbf{r}')$ is zero for all such points $\\mathbf{r}'$. Consequently, the integrand $\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot},B}(\\mathbf{r}') V_A(\\mathbf{r}')$ is identically zero everywhere.\nThus, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Coulomb}} = 0$.\n\nCombining the results, the total interaction energy is:\n$$\n\\Delta E(R) = \\Delta T_s + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Coulomb}} = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe interaction energy is exactly zero for all separations $R > 2a$. The leading-order asymptotic behavior as $R \\to \\infty$ is therefore trivially zero. No algebraic term in $R^{-p}$ appears.\n\nExplanation for the absence of London dispersion:\nThe physical origin of London dispersion forces is the long-range correlation of instantaneous quantum fluctuations in the electron clouds of interacting fragments. An instantaneous dipole in one fragment induces a dipole in the other, leading to a net attractive interaction that asymptotically decays as $R^{-6}$.\nThe derivation above shows that the PBE functional, under the frozen-density non-overlapping-spheres model, predicts zero interaction. This failure has two fundamental sources rooted in the problem's premises:\n$1$. The semilocal nature of PBE: As demonstrated, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}} = 0$ because the PBE energy density at a point $\\mathbf{r}$ depends only on the density $n(\\mathbf{r})$ and its gradient $\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})$ at that same point. This functional form is, by construction, incapable of describing the physical correlation between an electron in sphere $A$ and an electron in sphere $B$. The XC hole is local to the electron and cannot extend to the other fragment.\n$2$. The frozen-density approximation: By fixing the densities to be those of the isolated spheres, we prevent any polarization response. The true electron density would deform in the presence of the other sphere. However, even with this relaxation, a semilocal functional like PBE would only capture classical electrostatic and overlap-dependent effects, not the long-range correlation responsible for dispersion.\nIn summary, the PBE functional lacks the necessary non-local correlation physics to describe dispersion forces. The interaction energy is reduced to a simple classical electrostatic problem between two neutral, spherically symmetric, non-overlapping objects, which is zero.

Substituting this form of $T$ into the expression for $\\tilde{\\alpha}$ produces the final analytical result:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha_0}{1 - \\frac{2\\alpha_0}{R^3}}\n$$\nWe are now required to evaluate this expression for the given values $\\alpha_0 = 10$ a.u. and $R = 5$ a.u.\nFirst, we calculate the numerical value of the product $\\alpha_0 T$:\n$$\n\\alpha_0 T = \\alpha_0 \\left( \\frac{2}{R^3} \\right) = 10 \\left( \\frac{2}{(5)^3} \\right) = 10 \\left( \\frac{2}{125} \\right) = \\frac{20}{125}\n$$\nSubstituting this value into the formula for $\\tilde{\\alpha}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\alpha} = \\frac{10}{1 - \\frac{20}{125}}\n$$\nTo simplify the denominator, we express $1$ as $\\frac{125}{125}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\alpha} = \\frac{10}{\\frac{125 - 20}{125}} = \\frac{10}{\\frac{105}{125}}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\alpha} = 10 \\times \\frac{125}{105} = \\frac{1250}{105}\n$$\nTo obtain the exact value as an irreducible fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of $1250$ and $105$. Both are divisible by $5$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\alpha} = \\frac{1250 \\div 5}{105 \\div 5} = \\frac{250}{21}\n$$\nThe numerator is $250 = 2 \\times 5^3$ and the denominator is $21 = 3 \\times 7$. They share no common factors, so the fraction is in its simplest form. The resulting screened polarizability is greater than the bare polarizability ($\\frac{250}{21} \\approx 11.9 > 10$), which is the correct physical behavior for a longitudinal arrangement, where the field from each induced dipole enhances the external field at the position of the other dipole. This phenomenon is an electrostatic polarization enhancement, or \"anti-screening\".", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{250}{21}}\n$$", "id": "2768792"}]}
