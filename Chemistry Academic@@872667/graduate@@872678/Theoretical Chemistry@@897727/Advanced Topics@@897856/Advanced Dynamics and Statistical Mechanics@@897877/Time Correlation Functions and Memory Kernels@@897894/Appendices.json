It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and requires a rigorous derivation. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we are tasked with deriving the explicit form of the causal friction memory kernel, $\\gamma(t)$, for a system with an Ohmic spectral density with a Drude cutoff.\n\nThe givens are:\n$1$. The relation between the kernel $\\gamma(t)$ and the spectral density $J(\\omega)$ for $t0$:\n$$ \\gamma(t) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{J(\\omega)}{\\omega}\\,\\cos(\\omega t)\\,d\\omega $$\n$2$.

The factor of $\\omega$ in the numerator of $J(\\omega)$ cancels with the $\\omega$ in the denominator of the integrand.\n$$ \\gamma(t) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\left( \\frac{\\eta\\,\\omega\\,\\omega_{c}^{2}}{\\omega_{c}^{2}+\\omega^{2}} \\right) \\cos(\\omega t)\\,d\\omega $$\n$$ \\gamma(t) = \\frac{2\\eta\\omega_{c}^{2}}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\cos(\\omega t)}{\\omega_{c}^{2}+\\omega^{2}}\\,d\\omega $$\nThe integral is a standard Fourier cosine transform. We can evaluate it using complex analysis via the residue theorem. The integrand is an even function of $\\omega$, so we may write:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\cos(\\omega t)}{\\omega_{c}^{2}+\\omega^{2}}\\,d\\omega = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\cos(\\omega t)}{\\omega_{c}^{2}+\\omega^{2}}\\,d\\omega = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{Re} \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{e^{i\\omega t}}{\\omega_{c}^{2}+\\omega^{2}}\\,d\\omega \\right] $$\nConsider the complex integral $\\oint_{C} \\frac{e^{izt}}{z^{2}+\\omega_{c}^{2}}\\,dz$. The integrand has simple poles at $z=\\pm i\\omega_{c}$. For $t0$, we close the contour in the upper half-plane, enclosing the pole at $z=i\\omega_{c}$. By Jordan's lemma, the integral over the semicircular arc vanishes as its radius tends to infinity. The integral along the real axis is then given by $2\\pi i$ times the residue at the enclosed pole.\n$$ \\text{Res}(z=i\\omega_{c}) = \\lim_{z \\to i\\omega_{c}} (z-i\\omega_{c})\\frac{e^{izt}}{(z-i\\omega_{c})(z+i\\omega_{c})} = \\frac{e^{i(i\\omega_{c})t}}{2i\\omega_{c}} = \\frac{e^{-\\omega_{c}t}}{2i\\omega_{c}} $$\nTherefore, the integral along the real axis is:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{e^{i\\omega t}}{\\omega_{c}^{2}+\\omega^{2}}\\,d\\omega = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\text{Res}(z=i\\omega_{c}) = 2\\pi i \\left( \\frac{e^{-\\omega_{c}t}}{2i\\omega_{c}} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{c}} e^{-\\omega_{c}t} $$\nThis result is purely real, so taking the real part is trivial. The original integral from $0$ to $\\infty$ is half of this value:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\cos(\\omega t)}{\\omega_{c}^{2}+\\omega^{2}}\\,d\\omega = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{c}} e^{-\\omega_{c}t} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega_{c}} e^{-\\omega_{c}t} $$\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $\\gamma(t)$:\n$$ \\gamma(t) = \\frac{2\\eta\\omega_{c}^{2}}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega_{c}} e^{-\\omega_{c}t} \\right) = \\eta\\omega_{c} e^{-\\omega_{c}t} $$\nThis is the explicit form of the memory kernel for $t0$.\n\nNext, we analyze the Markovian limit, which corresponds to an infinitely fast bath, i.e., $\\omega_{c} \\to \\infty$. The memory time of the kernel is of order $1/\\omega_{c}$.\nThe memory kernel becomes $\\gamma(t) = \\eta\\omega_{c}e^{-\\omega_{c}t}$.\nFor any fixed time $t0$, the limit is:\n$$ \\lim_{\\omega_{c}\\to\\infty} \\gamma(t) = \\lim_{\\omega_{c}\\to\\infty} \\eta\\omega_{c}e^{-\\omega_{c}t} = 0 $$\nas the exponential decay dominates the linear factor.\nAt $t=0$, $\\gamma(0) = \\eta\\omega_{c}$, which diverges as $\\omega_{c}\\to\\infty$.\nThe function thus becomes infinitely sharp and infinitely high at $t=0$, while being zero for all $t0$. This is characteristic of a Dirac delta distribution. To determine the strength of this distribution, we compute the integral of the kernel over its domain:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\gamma(t)\\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\eta\\omega_{c}e^{-\\omega_{c}t}\\,dt = \\eta\\omega_{c} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\omega_{c}} e^{-\\omega_{c}t} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\eta\\omega_{c} \\left( 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\omega_{c}}\\right) \\right) = \\eta $$\nThe integral of the function $\\gamma(t)$ is $\\eta$, independent of $\\omega_{c}$. A sequence of functions that becomes infinitely peaked at the origin, is zero elsewhere, and maintains a constant integral represents a delta distribution. Therefore, in the sense of distributions:\n$$ \\lim_{\\omega_{c}\\to\\infty} \\gamma(t) = \\eta \\delta(t) $$\nHere, $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function, understood in the context of causal systems where its support is concentrated at $t=0^{+}$.\n\nWe now demonstrate how this limit recovers memoryless friction in the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). The friction term in the GLE is given by the convolution integral $-\\int_{0}^{t} \\gamma(t-\\tau)v(\\tau)\\,d\\tau$, where $v(t)$ is the particle's velocity.\nIn the Markovian limit, this term becomes:\n$$ -\\int_{0}^{t} \\left( \\lim_{\\omega_{c}\\to\\infty} \\gamma(t-\\tau) \\right) v(\\tau)\\,d\\tau = -\\int_{0}^{t} \\eta\\delta(t-\\tau)v(\\tau)\\,d\\tau $$\nBy the sifting property of the delta function, where the spike is at $\\tau=t$ (the upper limit of integration), for a causal system this integral evaluates to:\n$$ -\\eta v(t) $$\nThe friction term thus becomes proportional to the instantaneous velocity, which is the definition of memoryless, or Markovian, friction. The friction coefficient is $\\eta$.\n\nThis result can be confirmed in the Laplace domain. The Laplace transform of the memory kernel, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\gamma(t)\\}$, is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\gamma}(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} (\\eta\\omega_{c}e^{-\\omega_{c}t})\\,dt = \\eta\\omega_{c} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s+\\omega_{c})t}\\,dt = \\frac{\\eta\\omega_{c}}{s+\\omega_{c}} $$\nNow, we take the Markovian limit $\\omega_{c}\\to\\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\omega_{c}\\to\\infty} \\tilde{\\gamma}(s) = \\lim_{\\omega_{c}\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\eta\\omega_{c}}{s+\\omega_{c}} = \\lim_{\\omega_{c}\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\eta}{(s/\\omega_{c})+1} = \\eta $$\nThe Laplace transform of the friction term in the GLE is $-\\tilde{\\gamma}(s)\\tilde{v}(s)$. In the limit, this becomes $-\\eta\\tilde{v}(s)$. The inverse Laplace transform of this term is $-\\eta v(t)$, which again confirms that the friction becomes memoryless with coefficient $\\eta$. The consistency between the time and Laplace domain analyses confirms the correctness of our conclusions. A typical point of confusion regarding a factor of $2$ arises from relating the causal kernel to the symmetrized noise correlation function via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, but as shown, a careful and consistent application of mathematical definitions resolves any apparent paradox.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\eta\\,\\omega_{c}\\,\\exp(-\\omega_{c}\\,t)}$$", "id": "2825430"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how to calculate a memory kernel, we now explore its fundamental physical origin using the Mori–Zwanzig formalism.

The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we establish the necessary equilibrium averages for a classical one-dimensional harmonic oscillator in a canonical ensemble at temperature $T$. The Hamiltonian is $H = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 q^2$. The probability distribution in phase space is proportional to $\\exp(-\\beta H)$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. Due to the quadratic form of the Hamiltonian, the potential energy is an even function of $q$ and the kinetic energy is an even function of $p$. Consequently, the averages of any odd powers of $q$ or $p$ are zero.\n$$ \\langle q \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0, \\quad \\langle p \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0 $$\nThe fluctuations are thus identical to the variables themselves: $\\delta q = q$ and $\\delta p = p$.\nFrom the equipartition theorem, we have:\n$$ \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 q^2 \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T \\implies \\langle q^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_B T}{m \\omega^2} $$\n$$ \\left\\langle \\frac{p^2}{2m} \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T \\implies \\langle p^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = m k_B T $$\nThe cross-correlation is zero due to the separability of the Hamiltonian in $q$ and $p$:\n$$ \\langle q p \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{\\iint qp \\, \\exp(-\\beta H) \\, dq \\, dp}{\\iint \\exp(-\\beta H) \\, dq \\, dp} = 0 $$\nThe inner product $(A, B) = \\langle \\delta A \\, \\delta B \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ simplifies to $(A, B) = \\langle A B \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ for linear combinations of $q$ and $p$.\n\n1) Construction of the orthonormal set $\\{A_1, A_2\\}$.\nWe apply the Gram-Schmidt procedure to the set $\\{q, p\\}$.\nFirst, select the variable $v_1 = q$. Its norm-squared is:\n$$ (v_1, v_1) = (q, q) = \\langle q^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_B T}{m \\omega^2} $$\nThe first orthonormal variable $A_1$ is obtained by normalization:\n$$ A_1 = \\frac{v_1}{\\sqrt{(v_1, v_1)}} = \\frac{q}{\\sqrt{\\langle q^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}}} = q \\sqrt{\\frac{m \\omega^2}{k_B T}} $$\nNext, select the variable $v_2 = p$. We find the component of $v_2$ orthogonal to $A_1$. Since variables $q$ and $p$ are already orthogonal, $(v_1, v_2) = (q, p) = \\langle qp \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0$, the orthogonalization step is trivial. We only need to normalize $v_2$. The norm-squared of $v_2$ is:\n$$ (v_2, v_2) = (p, p) = \\langle p^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = m k_B T $$\nThe second orthonormal variable $A_2$ is:\n$$ A_2 = \\frac{v_2}{\\sqrt{(v_2, v_2)}} = \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{\\langle p^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}}} = \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{m k_B T}} $$\nThus, the orthonormal set is $\\{A_1, A_2\\} = \\left\\{ q \\sqrt{\\frac{m \\omega^2}{k_B T}}, \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{m k_B T}} \\right\\}$.\n\n2) Derivation and evaluation of the memory kernel $M(0)$.\nThe Mori-Zwanzig formalism provides a Generalized Langevin Equation for a relevant variable, here taken as $A_1$. The dynamics are projected onto the subspace spanned by $A_1$ using the projection operator $\\mathcal{P}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{P} X = \\frac{(A_1, X)}{(A_1, A_1)} A_1 = (A_1, X) A_1 $$\nwhere the second equality holds because $A_1$ is normalized. The complementary projection is $\\mathcal{Q} = 1 - \\mathcal{P}$. The memory kernel $M(t)$ is defined via the autocorrelation of the random force $F(t) = \\exp(i\\mathcal{Q}\\mathcal{L}t) i\\mathcal{Q}\\mathcal{L}A_1$:\n$$ M(t) = \\frac{(F(t), F(0))}{(A_1, A_1)} = (F(0), e^{-i\\mathcal{Q}\\mathcal{L}t} F(0)) $$\nwhere we have used the self-adjointness of the propagator in the inner product. At time $t=0$, this gives:\n$$ M(0) = (F(0), F(0)) = (i\\mathcal{Q}\\mathcal{L}A_1, i\\mathcal{Q}\\mathcal{L}A_1) $$\nUsing $\\mathcal{Q} = 1 - \\mathcal{P}$ and expanding, we obtain the general expression for $M(0)$ in terms of the Liouvillian $i\\mathcal{L}$ and equilibrium averages (inner products):\n$$ M(0) = (i\\mathcal{L}A_1 - \\mathcal{P}(i\\mathcal{L}A_1), i\\mathcal{L}A_1 - \\mathcal{P}(i\\mathcal{L}A_1)) = (i\\mathcal{L}A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1) - ((A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1)A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1) - (i\\mathcal{L}A_1, (A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1)A_1) + ((A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1)A_1, (A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1)A_1) $$\n$$ M(0) = (i\\mathcal{L}A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1) - (A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1)^2 - (A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1)^2 + (A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1)^2(A_1, A_1) $$\nSince $(A_1, A_1) = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ M(0) = (i\\mathcal{L}A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1) - (A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1)^2 $$\nThis expression connects $M(0)$ to the Liouvillian and equilibrium averages, as requested.\n\nTo evaluate this for our system, we first compute the action of $i\\mathcal{L}$ on $A_1$. The operator $i\\mathcal{L}$ acts as the Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian, $i\\mathcal{L}X = \\{X, H\\}$.\n$$ i\\mathcal{L}A_1 = \\{A_1, H\\} = \\left\\{q \\sqrt{\\frac{m \\omega^2}{k_B T}}, \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 q^2\\right\\} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m \\omega^2}{k_B T}} \\{q, H\\} $$\n$$ \\{q, H\\} = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial q}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} - \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial p}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{p}{m} - 0 = \\frac{p}{m} $$\nSo,\n$$ i\\mathcal{L}A_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{m \\omega^2}{k_B T}} \\left(\\frac{p}{m}\\right) = p \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega^2}{m k_B T}} $$\nUsing the definition $A_2 = p/\\sqrt{m k_B T}$, we find a compact relation:\n$$ i\\mathcal{L}A_1 = \\omega A_2 $$\nNow we evaluate the two terms in the expression for $M(0)$:\n$$ (A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1) = (A_1, \\omega A_2) = \\omega (A_1, A_2) = 0 $$\nThis is the frequency term $i\\Omega_{11}$, which is null.\n$$ (i\\mathcal{L}A_1, i\\mathcal{L}A_1) = (\\omega A_2, \\omega A_2) = \\omega^2 (A_2, A_2) = \\omega^2 $$\nsince $A_2$ is normalized. Substituting these into the formula for $M(0)$:\n$$ M(0) = \\omega^2 - 0^2 = \\omega^2 $$\n\n3) Modification of the memory kernel by extending the relevant set.\nThe memory kernel arises from the dynamics projected onto the subspace orthogonal to the set of relevant variables. For the one-variable set $\\{A_1\\}$, the orthogonal subspace contains $A_2$. The time evolution of $A_1$, given by $i\\mathcal{L}A_1 = \\omega A_2$, is entirely directed into this orthogonal subspace. This \"orthogonal flux\", $i\\mathcal{Q}\\mathcal{L}A_1 = i\\mathcal{L}A_1$, is the source of the memory effect, and its initial magnitude squared gives $M(0) = \\omega^2$.\n\nWhen the relevant set is extended to $\\{A_1, A_2\\}$, the projection operator becomes $\\mathcal{P}_{12} = (A_1, \\cdot)A_1 + (A_2, \\cdot)A_2$, and the orthogonal projector is $\\mathcal{Q}_{12} = 1 - \\mathcal{P}_{12}$. The dynamics of the variables in the set are described by the Liouvillian. We have $i\\mathcal{L}A_1 = \\omega A_2$. We also compute $i\\mathcal{L}A_2$:\n$$ i\\mathcal{L}A_2 = \\{A_2, H\\} = \\left\\{\\frac{p}{\\sqrt{m k_B T}}, H\\right\\} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m k_B T}} \\{p, H\\} $$\n$$ \\{p, H\\} = \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial q}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} - \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial p}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = 0 - 1 \\cdot (m\\omega^2 q) = -m\\omega^2 q $$\n$$ i\\mathcal{L}A_2 = \\frac{-m\\omega^2 q}{\\sqrt{m k_B T}} = -\\omega \\left( q \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega^2}{k_B T}} \\right) = -\\omega A_1 $$\nThe time evolution of both $A_1$ and $A_2$ under $i\\mathcal{L}$ produces vectors that remain within the span of $\\{A_1, A_2\\}$. This means the set $\\{A_1, A_2\\}$ is closed under the action of the Liouvillian.\nConsequently, the projection of the time derivatives onto the orthogonal subspace is zero:\n$$ i\\mathcal{Q}_{12}\\mathcal{L}A_1 = (1-\\mathcal{P}_{12})(\\omega A_2) = \\omega A_2 - ((A_1, \\omega A_2)A_1 + (A_2, \\omega A_2)A_2) = \\omega A_2 - (0 \\cdot A_1 + \\omega \\cdot A_2) = 0 $$\n$$ i\\mathcal{Q}_{12}\\mathcal{L}A_2 = (1-\\mathcal{P}_{12})(-\\omega A_1) = -\\omega A_1 - ((A_1, -\\omega A_1)A_1 + (A_2, -\\omega A_1)A_2) = -\\omega A_1 - (-\\omega \\cdot A_1 + 0 \\cdot A_2) = 0 $$\nSince the random force components $F_1(t)$ and $F_2(t)$ are generated by these terms, they are identically zero for all time. This implies that the entire memory kernel matrix $\\mathbf{M}(t)$ for the two-variable system is zero. In particular, the element $M_{11}(0)$, which would be the analogue of the scalar kernel from the first case, is zero.\nExtending the relevant set from $\\{A_1\\}$ to $\\{A_1, A_2\\}$ thus reduces the initial value of the memory kernel associated with $A_1$ from $M(0) = \\omega^2$ to $M_{11}(0) = 0$. This inclusion of the momentum variable fully captures the short-time (in fact, all-time) dynamics, leaving no \"memory\" effects from an orthogonal bath.\n\nThe final answer required is the dimensionless quantity $M(0)/\\omega^2$, where $M(0)$ is the kernel from the one-dimensional projection in part 2.\n$$ \\frac{M(0)}{\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega^2} = 1 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2825473"}, {"introduction": "The final step in building a reduced model is to validate its assumptions against data from the underlying microscopic reality.

All concepts—the GLE, memory kernel, projected noise, and FDT—are standard and rigorously defined. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The question is well-posed. It asks to identify the correct procedure from a set of options, based on explicitly stated theoretical constraints. This structure admits a unique, correct answer derived from first principles.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective elements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question about the practical application of theoretical principles. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe evolution of the variable $A(t)$ within the Mori-Zwanzig formalism is described by the Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE). For a single variable $A$ with $\\langle A \\rangle = 0$ and stationary statistics (which implies $\\langle \\dot{A} A \\rangle = 0$), the GLE is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = - \\int_0^t K(\\tau) A(t-\\tau) d\\tau + R(t)\n$$\nHere, $K(t)$ is the memory kernel and $R(t)$ is the projected (or random) force. These quantities are defined via the projection operator $P$ onto the variable $A$, where $P X = \\frac{\\langle X A \\rangle}{\\langle A^2 \\rangle} A$. The projected force is $R(t) = e^{t(1-P)i\\mathcal{L}}(1-P)i\\mathcal{L}A$, where $i\\mathcal{L}$ is the Liouvillian propagator.\n\nTwo fundamental properties arise from this construction:\n1.  **Orthogonality of the Projected Force**: The projected force $R(t)$ is, by construction, orthogonal to the relevant variable $A$ at time $t=0$. That is, $\\langle R(t) A(0) \\rangle = 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$. This orthogonality is a critical test of whether the chosen variable $A$ is sufficient to span the slow subspace of the system. If other slow variables are coupled to $A$, this orthogonality will be violated in a practical estimation, indicating that the single-variable GLE is an incomplete model.\n2.  **Second Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT)**: The memory kernel $K(t)$, which represents dissipation, is related to the autocorrelation function of the projected force $R(t)$, which represents fluctuations. This relation is the second FDT:\n    $$\n    K(t) = \\frac{\\langle R(t) R(0) \\rangle}{\\langle A^2 \\rangle}\n    $$\nThis theorem provides a powerful consistency check. One can estimate $K(t)$ directly from the GLE (e.g., via regression) and also compute it from the autocorrelation of the residual force. Agreement between these two quantities validates the GLE model.\n\n**Near-Markovianity Assessment**\nThe system is near-Markovian if the memory kernel $K(t)$ decays much faster than the variable's own autocorrelation function, $C(t) = \\langle A(0) A(t) \\rangle$. A practical procedure must therefore first validate that the GLE framework is appropriate for the chosen variable $A(t)$ (using the two criteria above) and then, if validated, examine the timescale of $K(t)$ relative to that of $C(t)$.\n\nA practical implementation using trajectory data involves:\n1.  Numerically calculating $\\dot{A}(t)$.\n2.  Treating the GLE as a linear regression problem to find an optimal $K(t)$ that relates the history of $A$ to $\\dot{A}(t)$. This is a non-parametric estimation of the kernel.\n3.  Calculating the residual of this fit, which serves as an estimate of the projected force trajectory, $R(t)$.\n4.  Checking the two mandatory criteria:\n    - (i) Compute $\\langle R(t) A(0) \\rangle$ and verify it is negligible for all $t \\ge 0$.\n    - (ii) Compute the autocorrelation $\\langle R(t) R(0) \\rangle$, use the second FDT to construct a second estimate of the kernel, $K_{\\text{FDT}}(t) = \\langle R(t) R(0) \\rangle / \\langle A^2 \\rangle$, and compare it to the kernel from regression, $K_{\\text{reg}}(t)$. A small discrepancy (\"FDT residual\") is required.\n5.  If these checks pass, assess near-Markovianity by comparing the decay time of $K(t)$ to the decay time of $C(t)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Fit a single-exponential model to the equilibrium time correlation $C(t) \\equiv \\langle A(0) A(t) \\rangle$ and declare the dynamics near-Markovian if the fit residuals fall within statistical noise. No explicit construction of noise or checks against the second Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) are necessary when $C(t)$ is nearly exponential.**\n\nThis procedure is flawed. While a perfectly Markovian process would indeed exhibit a single-exponential decay of $C(t)$, observing a near-exponential decay is not sufficient proof. More importantly, this method completely ignores the problem's explicit instructions to use diagnostics based on (i) noise orthogonality and (ii) the second FDT. It bypasses the entire GLE structure that the question is centered upon. One cannot simply ignore the mandatory conditions of the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. Nonparametrically estimate a memory kernel $K(t)$ by regressing $\\dot{A}(t)$ onto the history of $A(t)$ over a finite window, form the residual process $R(t)$ as the difference between $\\dot{A}(t)$ and the regressed contribution, then perform both of the following: (1) test orthogonality by estimating $\\langle R(t) A(0) \\rangle$ over lags $t$ and require it to be small relative to $\\sqrt{\\langle R(0) R(0) \\rangle \\langle A(0) A(0) \\rangle}$; and (2) quantify an FDT residual by comparing the independently regressed $K(t)$ to the kernel reconstructed from the residual autocorrelation via the second Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT), requiring the normalized discrepancy to be small. Additionally, verify short-memory by checking that the correlation time of $K(t)$ is much smaller than that of $C(t)$.**\n\nThis procedure is a textbook implementation of the principles I have outlined. It correctly identifies that $K(t)$ can be estimated via regression and that the regression residual is the estimated projected force $R(t)$. It then explicitly performs the two required checks: testing the orthogonality condition $\\langle R(t) A(0) \\rangle \\approx 0$ and validating the second FDT by comparing the regressed kernel with the one constructed from the force-force autocorrelation. The final step, comparing the correlation times of $K(t)$ and $C(t)$, is the correct way to assess near-Markovianity *after* the GLE model itself has been validated. The normalization for the orthogonality check is also physically and statistically sensible.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Verify that the areas under the curves of the equilibrium time correlation and the memory kernel are equal, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t)\\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} K(t)\\, dt$, and that the residual $R(t)$ has zero mean, $\\langle R(t) \\rangle = 0$. If both hold within statistical error, conclude the kernel is effectively Markovian.**\n\nThis procedure is fundamentally incorrect. First, the condition $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t)\\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} K(t)\\, dt$ is dimensionally and theoretically nonsensical. The Laplace transform of the memory equation $\\dot{C}(t) = -\\int_0^t K(\\tau)C(t-\\tau)d\\tau$ gives $\\tilde{C}(s) = C(0) / (s + \\tilde{K}(s))$. Evaluating at $s=0$ yields the correct identity $\\int_0^\\infty K(t) dt = C(0) / (\\int_0^\\infty C(t) dt)$. The proposed equality is false. Second, the condition $\\langle R(t) \\rangle = 0$ is a trivial consequence of $\\langle A(t) \\rangle = 0$ and the structure of the GLE; it provides no information about memory timescales. Finally, this option fails to incorporate the two mandatory checks (orthogonality and FDT).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Compute the power spectral density of $A(t)$ and accept near-Markovianity if the spectrum is flat over the frequency range of interest, since a flat spectrum indicates that the process is white and therefore governed by a delta-correlated memory kernel, making orthogonality and second Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) checks unnecessary.**\n\nThis procedure is based on a severe misunderstanding. A flat power spectrum corresponds to a signal that is \"white noise,\" meaning its autocorrelation function is a delta function, $C(t) \\propto \\delta(t)$. A relevant physical variable $A(t)$ is not white noise; it has a finite correlation time. It is the *projected force* $R(t)$ that becomes white noise in the Markovian limit, meaning its autocorrelation $\\langle R(t)R(0)\\rangle$ approaches a delta function. By the second FDT, this implies a delta-function memory kernel $K(t)$, which is the definition of a Markovian process. The spectrum of the *variable* $A(t)$ in the Markovian limit is a Lorentzian, not flat. Most critically, this option explicitly advises that the mandatory orthogonality and FDT checks are \"unnecessary,\" in direct violation of the problem's constraints.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2825431"}]}
