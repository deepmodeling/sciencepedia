The effective Hamiltonian is given by a cumulant expansion:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{}[\\phi_{}] = \\mathcal{H}_{}^{(0)}[\\phi_{}] - \\ln\\left\\langle \\exp\\left(-\\int d^d x V_{int}\\right) \\right\\rangle_{} = \\mathcal{H}_{}^{(0)}[\\phi_{}] + \\left\\langle \\int d^d x V_{int} \\right\\rangle_{} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\langle \\left(\\int d^d x V_{int}\\right)^2 \\right\\rangle_{c} + \\dots\n$$\nwhere $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_{}$ denotes an average over the Gaussian measure defined by $\\mathcal{H}_{0,}$. The relevant terms from $V_{int}$ that contribute to one-loop corrections are those containing $\\phi_{}$:\n$$\nV_{int} = \\frac{u}{4!} \\left( 4\\phi_{}^3 \\phi_{} + 6\\phi_{}^2 \\phi_{}^2 + 4\\phi_{} \\phi_{}^3 + \\phi_{}^4 \\right) + \\text{terms in } \\mathcal{H}_{}^{(0)}.\n$$\nThe first cumulant (tadpole diagram): Averages of odd powers of $\\phi_{}$ vanish. The only non-zero contribution comes from the $\\phi_{}^2 \\phi_{}^2$ term.\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\int d^d x \\frac{u}{4!} (6 \\phi_{}^2 \\phi_{}^2) \\right\\rangle_{} = \\int d^d x \\frac{u}{4} \\phi_{}^2(x) \\langle \\phi_{}^2(x) \\rangle_{}.\n$$\nThe correlator $\\langle \\phi_{}^2(x) \\rangle_{}$ is given by the momentum-shell integral:\n$$\n\\langle \\phi_{}^2(x) \\rangle_{} = \\int_{\\Lambda/b  q  \\Lambda} \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{1}{q^2+r} \\approx \\int_{\\Lambda/b  q  \\Lambda} \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{1}{q^2}.\n$$\nSwitching to an infinitesimal scaling $b=e^{\\delta l} \\approx 1+\\delta l$, the integration shell is $[\\Lambda(1-\\delta l), \\Lambda]$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Lambda(1-\\delta l)  q  \\Lambda} \\frac{S_d q^{d-1} dq}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{1}{q^2} = K_d \\int_{\\Lambda(1-\\delta l)}^{\\Lambda} q^{d-3} dq \\approx K_d \\Lambda^{d-3} (\\Lambda \\delta l) = K_d \\Lambda^{d-2} \\delta l.\n$$\nThis modifies the coefficient of the $\\frac{1}{2}\\phi^2$ term. The change in $r$, denoted $\\delta r$, is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\delta r \\int d^dx \\phi_{}^2 = \\int d^dx \\frac{u}{4} \\phi_{}^2 (K_d \\Lambda^{d-2} \\delta l) \\implies \\delta r = \\frac{u}{2} K_d \\Lambda^{d-2} \\delta l.\n$$\nThe second cumulant (bubble diagram): This corrects the $\\phi^4$ term. To leading order in $u$, we consider the connected correlator of the $V_1 = \\int d^d x \\frac{u}{4}\\phi_{}^2\\phi_{}^2$ term:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2} \\langle V_1^2 \\rangle_c = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{u}{4}\\right)^2 \\int d^dx \\int d^dy \\, \\phi_{}^2(x) \\phi_{}^2(y) \\langle \\phi_{}^2(x) \\phi_{}^2(y) \\rangle_c.\n$$\nBy Wick's theorem, $\\langle \\phi_{}^2(x) \\phi_{}^2(y) \\rangle_c = 2 (\\langle \\phi_{}(x) \\phi_{}(y) \\rangle)^2$. For slowly varying fields $\\phi_{}$, we approximate $\\phi_{}(y) \\approx \\phi_{}(x)$, giving a correction to the $\\phi^4$ term:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathcal{H}_{\\phi^4} \\approx -\\left(\\frac{u}{4}\\right)^2 \\int d^dx \\, \\phi_{}^4(x) \\int d^dy \\left( \\int_{\\Lambda/bq\\Lambda} \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{e^{i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y})}}{q^2} \\right)^2.\n$$\nUsing Parseval's theorem, the integral over $y$ is $\\int \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d} (1/q^2)^2 = \\int_{\\Lambda/bq\\Lambda} \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{1}{q^4}$. For an infinitesimal shell, this evaluates to:\n$$\nI_2 = K_d \\int_{\\Lambda(1-\\delta l)}^{\\Lambda} q^{d-5} dq \\approx K_d \\Lambda^{d-5} (\\Lambda \\delta l) = K_d \\Lambda^{d-4} \\delta l.\n$$\nThe change in the $u/4!$ term is then:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta u}{4!} \\int d^dx \\phi_{}^4 = -\\left(\\frac{u}{4}\\right)^2 I_2 \\int d^dx \\phi_{}^4 \\implies \\delta u = -\\frac{24}{16} u^2 I_2 = -\\frac{3}{2} u^2 K_d \\Lambda^{d-4} \\delta l.\n$$\nAt one-loop order, there is no correction to the gradient term. The parameters of the coarse-grained Hamiltonian are $r_{new} = r + \\delta r$ and $u_{new} = u + \\delta u$.\n\nStep 2: Rescaling\n\nLengths and fields are rescaled to restore the original form of the Hamiltonian with cutoff $\\Lambda$. Let $x = b x'$, $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{q}'/b$. The field is rescaled as $\\phi(x) = \\zeta \\phi'(x')$.\nThe gradient term transforms as:\n$$\n\\int d^d x \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 = \\int b^d d^d x' \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{b}\\nabla'\\right)^2 (\\zeta\\phi')^2 = \\frac{b^{d-2}\\zeta^2}{2} \\int d^d x' (\\nabla'\\phi')^2.\n$$\nTo keep its coefficient invariant ($=1/2$), we set $b^{d-2}\\zeta^2=1$, which gives $\\zeta = b^{-(d-2)/2}$.\nThe parameters $r$ and $u$ transform as:\n$$\nr' = b^2 r_{new} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u' = b^d \\zeta^4 u_{new} = b^{d-2(d-2)} u_{new} = b^{4-d} u_{new}.\n$$\nFor infinitesimal scaling $b = e^{\\delta l} \\approx 1+\\delta l$, we have $b^2 \\approx 1+2\\delta l$ and $b^{4-d} = b^\\varepsilon \\approx 1+\\varepsilon \\delta l$ with $\\varepsilon=4-d$. The changes in the parameters are:\n$$\ndr = r' - r = (1+2\\delta l)(r+\\delta r) - r \\approx 2r\\delta l + \\delta r.\n$$\n$$\ndu = u' - u = (1+\\varepsilon\\delta l)(u+\\delta u) - u \\approx \\varepsilon u\\delta l + \\delta u.\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\delta r$ and $\\delta u$ and dividing by $\\delta l$, we obtain the flow equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{dl} = 2r + \\frac{1}{2} K_d \\Lambda^{d-2} u.\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dl} = \\varepsilon u - \\frac{3}{2} K_d \\Lambda^{d-4} u^2.\n$$\n\nStep 3: Fixed Point Analysis\n\nWe introduce the dimensionless coupling $\\tilde{u} = K_d \\Lambda^{-\\varepsilon} u = K_d \\Lambda^{d-4} u$. Since $d$ is a fixed parameter of the theory, $K_d$ is constant along the flow. The flow equation for $\\tilde{u}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{u}}{dl} = K_d \\Lambda^{d-4} \\frac{du}{dl} = K_d \\Lambda^{d-4} \\left( \\varepsilon u - \\frac{3}{2} K_d \\Lambda^{d-4} u^2 \\right).\n$$\nSubstituting $u = \\tilde{u} / (K_d \\Lambda^{d-4})$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{u}}{dl} = \\varepsilon (K_d \\Lambda^{d-4} u) - \\frac{3}{2} (K_d \\Lambda^{d-4} u)^2 = \\varepsilon \\tilde{u} - \\frac{3}{2} \\tilde{u}^2.\n$$\nThe fixed points $\\tilde{u}^*$ of the flow are the solutions to $\\frac{d\\tilde{u}}{dl} = 0$:\n$$\n\\tilde{u}^* \\left( \\varepsilon - \\frac{3}{2} \\tilde{u}^* \\right) = 0.\n$$\nThis equation has two solutions. The first is the trivial Gaussian fixed point, $\\tilde{u}^*_{G} = 0$. The second is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point:\n$$\n\\varepsilon - \\frac{3}{2} \\tilde{u}^*_{WF} = 0 \\implies \\tilde{u}^*_{WF} = \\frac{2}{3}\\varepsilon.\n$$\nThis result is valid to leading order in $\\varepsilon$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}\\varepsilon}$$", "id": "2794283"}]}
