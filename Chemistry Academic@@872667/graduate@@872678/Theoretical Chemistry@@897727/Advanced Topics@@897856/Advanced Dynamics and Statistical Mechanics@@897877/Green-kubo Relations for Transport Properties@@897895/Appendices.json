It represents a standard exercise in the statistical mechanics of transport phenomena, specifically the connection between the Green-Kubo formalism and the Einstein-Helfand relations for mutual diffusion. All provided information is self-contained and consistent. Therefore, I deem the problem valid and proceed with a full solution.\n\n(a) Derivation of the mutual diffusion coefficient $D$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by connecting three theoretical frameworks: macroscopic transport equations, linear irreversible thermodynamics, and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the macroscopic description of diffusion. Fick's first law states that the average concentration current density, $\\langle \\mathbf{j}_{c} \\rangle$, is proportional to the gradient of the average concentration, $\\langle c \\rangle$. In an isotropic system, this is written as:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{j}_{c} \\rangle = -D \\nabla \\langle c \\rangle $$\nwhere $D$ is the mutual diffusion coefficient.\n\nSecond, from the theory of linear irreversible thermodynamics, the flux is driven by the gradient of a thermodynamic potential. For concentration transport at constant temperature $T$, the thermodynamic force is the negative gradient of the chemical potential difference, $\\mu$. The current is related to this force via an Onsager kinetic coefficient, $L$:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{j}_{c} \\rangle = -L \\nabla \\mu $$\n\nTo connect these two descriptions, we relate the gradient of chemical potential to the gradient of concentration. For small deviations from equilibrium, we can write:\n$$ \\nabla \\mu = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial c} \\right)_{T,P} \\nabla c $$\nSubstituting this into the thermodynamic expression for the current gives:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{j}_{c} \\rangle = -L \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial c} \\right) \\nabla c $$\nComparing this with Fick's first law, we identify the diffusion coefficient as:\n$$ D = L \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial c} \\right) $$\n\nThe problem defines a static susceptibility $\\chi$ such that a uniform perturbation in chemical potential difference $\\delta\\mu$ produces a uniform change in concentration $\\delta c$ with proportionality constant $\\chi$. This implies that $\\chi$ is the thermodynamic susceptibility $\\chi = (\\partial c / \\partial \\mu)_{T,P}$. Therefore, the thermodynamic factor is $(\\partial \\mu / \\partial c) = 1/\\chi$. The expression for $D$ becomes:\n$$ D = \\frac{L}{\\chi} $$\n\nThird, we invoke the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, in the form of a Green-Kubo relation, to express the Onsager coefficient $L$ in terms of microscopic fluctuations. For an isotropic system in three dimensions, the kinetic coefficient $L$ is related to the time integral of the equilibrium time autocorrelation function of the total concentration current, $\\mathbf{J}_c(t) = \\int_V d\\mathbf{r}\\,\\mathbf{j}_{c}(\\mathbf{r},t)$:\n$$ L = \\frac{1}{3 V k_{B} T} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dt\\,\\langle \\mathbf{J}_{c}(0)\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{c}(t)\\rangle $$\nThe factor of $1/3$ arises from averaging over the three spatial directions, utilizing the isotropy condition $\\langle J_{c,x}(0)J_{c,x}(t)\\rangle = \\langle J_{c,y}(0)J_{c,y}(t)\\rangle = \\langle J_{c,z}(0)J_{c,z}(t)\\rangle$ and the fact that cross-correlations $\\langle J_{c,\\alpha}(0)J_{c,\\beta}(t)\\rangle$ for $\\alpha \\neq \\beta$ vanish.\n\nSubstituting this Green-Kubo expression for $L$ into our equation for $D$, we arrive at the desired general expression for the mutual diffusion coefficient:\n$$ D = \\frac{1}{3 V k_{B} T \\chi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dt\\,\\langle \\mathbf{J}_{c}(0)\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{c}(t)\\rangle $$\nThis completes the derivation for part (a).\n\n(b) Evaluation of $D$ for the given correlation function.\n\nThe problem provides the specific functional form for the current autocorrelation function for time $t \\ge 0$:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{J}_{c}(0)\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{c}(t)\\rangle = 3\\,C_{0}\\,\\exp(-t/\\tau) $$\nwhere $C_0 > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$ are constants.\n\nTo find $D$, we must compute the time integral of this function:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dt\\,\\langle \\mathbf{J}_{c}(0)\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{c}(t)\\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dt\\,(3\\,C_{0}\\,\\exp(-t/\\tau)) $$\n$$ = 3\\,C_{0} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-t/\\tau)\\,dt $$\nThis is a standard exponential integral:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-t/\\tau)\\,dt = [-\\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau)]_{0}^{\\infty} = -\\tau(0 - 1) = \\tau $$\nThus, the integral evaluates to $3\\,C_{0}\\,\\tau$.\n\nNow, we substitute this result into the expression for $D$ derived in part (a):\n$$ D = \\frac{1}{3 V k_{B} T \\chi} (3\\,C_{0}\\,\\tau) $$\nThe factors of $3$ cancel, yielding the closed-form expression for $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{C_{0}\\,\\tau}{V k_{B} T \\chi} $$\n\n(c) Derivation using the Helfand moment and verification.\n\nThe Helfand moment (or collective coordinate) for diffusion is defined as the time integral of the total current:\n$$ \\mathbf{Q}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} ds\\,\\mathbf{J}_{c}(s) $$\nWe are interested in the long-time behavior of its mean-square displacement (MSD). By definition, $\\mathbf{Q}(0)=\\mathbf{0}$. The MSD is:\n$$ \\langle|\\mathbf{Q}(t)-\\mathbf{Q}(0)|^{2}\\rangle = \\langle|\\mathbf{Q}(t)|^{2}\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left( \\int_{0}^{t} ds_{1}\\,\\mathbf{J}_{c}(s_{1}) \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\int_{0}^{t} ds_{2}\\,\\mathbf{J}_{c}(s_{2}) \\right) \\right\\rangle $$\n$$ = \\int_{0}^{t} ds_{1} \\int_{0}^{t} ds_{2} \\langle \\mathbf{J}_{c}(s_{1})\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{c}(s_{2})\\rangle $$\nDue to stationarity of equilibrium correlations, $\\langle \\mathbf{J}_{c}(s_{1})\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{c}(s_{2})\\rangle$ depends only on the time difference $s_{2}-s_{1}$. Let $C_{J}(t) = \\langle \\mathbf{J}_{c}(0)\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{c}(t)\\rangle$. The double integral can be transformed into a single integral:\n$$ \\langle|\\mathbf{Q}(t)|^{2}\\rangle = 2 \\int_{0}^{t} d\\xi\\,(t-\\xi) C_{J}(\\xi) $$\nThe long-time slope of the MSD is its time derivative as $t \\to \\infty$.

Let us verify this. Setting $D$ as the proportionality constant:\n$$ \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle|\\mathbf{Q}(t)|^{2}\\rangle = D \\cdot (6\\,V\\,k_{B}\\,T\\,\\chi) $$\nSolving for $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle|\\mathbf{Q}(t)|^{2}\\rangle}{6\\,V\\,k_{B}\\,T\\,\\chi} = \\frac{2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\xi\\,\\langle \\mathbf{J}_{c}(0)\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{c}(\\xi)\\rangle}{6\\,V\\,k_{B}\\,T\\,\\chi} $$\n$$ D = \\frac{1}{3 V k_{B} T \\chi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\xi\\,\\langle \\mathbf{J}_{c}(0)\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{c}(\\xi)\\rangle $$\nThis is precisely the Green-Kubo expression for $D$ derived in part (a). This confirms the problem's statement about the relationship, which is known as an Einstein-Helfand relation.\n\nFinally, we explicitly compute the large-time slope using the given exponential correlation function and find the resulting $D$.\nThe slope is:\n$$ \\text{slope} = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dt\\,\\langle \\mathbf{J}_{c}(0)\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{c}(t)\\rangle = 2 \\times (3\\,C_{0}\\,\\tau) = 6\\,C_{0}\\,\\tau $$\nNow, we use the Einstein-Helfand relation to find $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{\\text{slope}}{6\\,V\\,k_{B}\\,T\\,\\chi} = \\frac{6\\,C_{0}\\,\\tau}{6\\,V\\,k_{B}\\,T\\,\\chi} $$\n$$ D = \\frac{C_{0}\\,\\tau}{V k_{B} T \\chi} $$\nThis result is identical to the one obtained in part (b), thus verifying the consistency between the Green-Kubo and Einstein-Helfand approaches for this system.

It provides a set of established physical principles—momentum conservation, diffusive relaxation of transverse momentum, and the consequences of periodic boundary conditions—and asks for an evaluation of several statements concerning the long-time dynamics of a fluid and the computation of its shear viscosity. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information to proceed with a rigorous analysis.\n\nThe analysis is based on the Green-Kubo formula for the shear viscosity, $\\eta$, which relates it to the time integral of the equilibrium stress-stress autocorrelation function (ACF), $C_{\\sigma}(t) = \\langle \\sigma_{ab}(t)\\sigma_{ab}(0)\\rangle$ for an off-diagonal component $a \\neq b$ of the stress tensor:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{V}{k_B T} \\int_0^\\infty C_{\\sigma}(t) \\, dt $$\nThe problem statement uses a definition where the prefactors are absorbed, $\\eta \\propto \\int_0^\\infty C_{\\sigma}(t) dt$, which does not affect the scaling arguments that follow.\n\nAccording to mode-coupling theory, the long-time behavior of any correlation function is dominated by its projection onto the slowest, hydrodynamic modes of the system, which correspond to conserved quantities. For a simple fluid, these are mass, momentum, and energy. The microscopic stress tensor $\\sigma_{ab}$ represents a flux of momentum. As such, its long-time dynamics are governed by its coupling to pairs of hydrodynamic modes. The dominant decay channel for the stress ACF involves a pair of transverse momentum modes.\n\nA transverse momentum mode with wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$ decays diffusively, with a correlation function decaying as $\\exp(-\\nu k^2 t)$, where $\\nu = \\eta/\\rho$ is the kinematic viscosity. The stress ACF, resulting from the coupling to two such modes, has its long-time behavior determined by an integral over all possible wave vectors:\n$$ C_{\\sigma}(t) \\propto \\int k^{d-1} e^{-2\\nu k^2 t} \\, dk \\quad \\text{for large } t $$\nwhere the factor of $2$ in the exponent arises from the two-mode decay channel. A change of variables $u = k\\sqrt{2\\nu t}$ shows that the integral is proportional to $(2\\nu t)^{-d/2}$. Thus, the characteristic algebraic long-time tail is:\n$$ C_{\\sigma}(t) \\sim t^{-d/2} $$\nIn a finite system of linear size $L$ with periodic boundary conditions, the continuous spectrum of wave vectors $\\mathbf{k}$ is replaced by a discrete set $\\mathbf{k}_{\\mathbf{n}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\mathbf{n}$ for $\\mathbf{n} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^d$.

For $d=3$, the general result $C_{\\sigma}(t) \\sim t^{-d/2}$ gives the celebrated long-time tail $C_{\\sigma}(t) \\sim t^{-3/2}$. In a finite box, the integral defining $\\eta$ is effectively truncated. The finite-size correction to the viscosity, $\\Delta\\eta(L)$, is due to this truncation and can be estimated by integrating the tail from the hydrodynamic cutoff time $t_L$ to infinity:\n$$ \\Delta\\eta(L) \\propto \\int_{t_L}^\\infty t^{-3/2} \\, dt = [-2t^{-1/2}]_{t_L}^\\infty = 2t_L^{-1/2} $$\nGiven $t_L \\propto L^2$, the correction scales as $\\Delta\\eta(L) \\propto (L^2)^{-1/2} = L^{-1}$. Therefore, the viscosity measured in a finite system, $\\eta(L)$, approaches the thermodynamic value $\\eta(\\infty)$ as $\\eta(L) = \\eta(\\infty) - c/L$ for some constant $c>0$. Extrapolating the computed $\\eta(L)$ values linearly against $1/L$ to find the intercept at $1/L=0$ is a standard and theoretically justified procedure. The alternative strategy of replacing the noisy tail of the simulated ACF with its known analytical form is also a common and valid technique to improve the estimate of $\\eta$. The choice of the crossover time $t^*$ is a practical detail, and relating it to system size is reasonable.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If global momentum is not conserved because a stochastic thermostat continuously damps the center-of-mass momentum, the stress autocorrelation still exhibits an algebraic tail $C_{\\sigma}(t)\\sim t^{-5/2}$, and the finite-size correction to $\\eta$ remains $\\propto L^{-1}$ in $d=3$.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The entire theoretical basis for the $t^{-d/2}$ long-time tail of the stress ACF is momentum conservation, which ensures the existence of slow, diffusive transverse momentum modes down to $k=0$. If momentum is not conserved (for instance, due to an external potential or a thermostat that violates Galilean invariance), the momentum modes are no longer hydrodynamic. Their relaxation rate acquires a gap, i.e., it remains finite as $k \\to 0$. This removes the primary mechanism for the algebraic tail. The stress ACF is expected to decay exponentially at long times. The claim that an algebraic tail persists is incorrect, and the specific form $t^{-5/2}$ is unfounded in this context. Consequently, the finite-size correction of $\\mathcal{O}(L^{-1})$, which is a direct consequence of the $t^{-3/2}$ tail, does not apply. Finite-size corrections for systems with exponentially decaying correlations are typically much smaller.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In $d=2$, the hydrodynamic tail of $C_{\\sigma}(t)$ behaves as $\\sim t^{-1}$, which leads to a logarithmic sensitivity of the equilibrium estimate of $\\eta$ to the upper time (or size) cutoff.

A practical extrapolation is a linear fit versus $\\ln L$.**\n\nThis statement is correct. For $d=2$, the mode-coupling prediction is $C_{\\sigma}(t) \\sim t^{-2/2} = t^{-1}$. The Green-Kubo integral for viscosity, $\\int_0^\\infty C_{\\sigma}(t) dt$, diverges logarithmically. This implies that the shear viscosity is not a well-defined transport coefficient in the thermodynamic limit for a 2D fluid. In a finite system of size $L$, the integral is cut off at the time scale $t_L \\propto L^2/\\nu$. The size-dependent viscosity $\\eta(L)$ is therefore estimated as:\n$$ \\eta(L) \\propto \\int^{t_L} t^{-1} \\, dt \\sim \\ln(t_L) $$\nSince $t_L \\propto L^2$, it follows that $\\eta(L) \\sim \\ln(L^2) = 2\\ln L$. The proposed functional form $\\eta(L) \\approx a+b\\ln L$ is therefore correct, and analyzing simulation data by fitting $\\eta(L)$ versus $\\ln L$ is the appropriate procedure for 2D systems.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The dominant long-time tail of $C_{\\sigma}(t)$ originates from coupling to the heat mode associated with energy conservation and therefore persists regardless of whether momentum is conserved. Consequently, the finite-size correction to $\\eta$ generally scales as $L^{-d}$ due to simple volume averaging.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. It misidentifies the physical origin of the long-time tail. The stress tensor component $\\sigma_{xy}$ is an even variable under time-reversal, while momentum density is odd and energy density is even. The dominant coupling is to a pair of odd-parity transverse momentum modes, as ($odd \\times odd = even$). While coupling to heat modes (energy fluctuations) is possible in principle, it is not the dominant mechanism for the stress ACF decay. The claim that the tail persists without momentum conservation is false, as demonstrated in the analysis of option B. Furthermore, the generic finite-size correction for viscosity does not scale as $L^{-d}$. This scaling is incorrect for a quantity whose finite-size effects are dominated by the cutoff of a long-time tail. The correct scaling is $L^{-1}$ in 3D, as shown in A.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. A complementary finite-size strategy is to compute a wave-vector-dependent shear viscosity $\\eta(k)$ from the transverse current correlation at discrete $k=2\\pi\\lvert\\mathbf{n}\\rvert/L$ and extrapolate to $k\\to 0$. By inversion symmetry and analyticity at small $k$, the leading correction is even in $k$, so $\\eta(k)=\\eta+c\\,k^{2}+\\mathcal{O}(k^{4})$; extrapolating linearly in $k$ would be biased, whereas extrapolating versus $k^{2}$ is consistent with hydrodynamics.**\n\nThis statement is correct. An alternative to the time-domain Green-Kubo approach is to work in the wave-vector domain. One can define and compute a $k$-dependent viscosity, $\\eta(k)$, from the properties of transverse current fluctuations at the discrete wave vectors $\\mathbf{k}$ allowed in a periodic box. The thermodynamic shear viscosity is the limit $\\eta = \\lim_{k\\to 0} \\eta(k)$. A fluid at equilibrium is statistically isotropic and possesses inversion symmetry, meaning its properties must be invariant under the transformation $\\mathbf{k} \\to -\\mathbf{k}$. For a scalar quantity like $\\eta(k)$, this requires it to be a function of the magnitude $k=|\\mathbf{k}|$ and to be an even function of $k$. Therefore, a Taylor expansion of $\\eta(k)$ around $k=0$ must only contain even powers of $k$:\n$$ \\eta(k) = \\eta(0) + c k^2 + \\mathcal{O}(k^4) $$\nwhere $\\eta(0) = \\eta$. Consequently, a plot of $\\eta(k)$ versus $k^2$ should be linear for small $k^2$, and a linear fit provides a robust extrapolation to the $k=0$ intercept. An extrapolation linear in $k$ would wrongly presuppose a leading term proportional to $k$, which is forbidden by symmetry.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2775078"}, {"introduction": "Moving from physical theory to computational practice requires a mastery of numerical experiment design.

Enforce the bounds by:\n- choosing $\\Delta t_{s}$ small enough that the composite trapezoidal-rule relative error for integrating an exponential is $\\lesssim (\\Delta t_{s}/\\tau_{c})^{2}/12 \\le \\varepsilon/4$, i.e., $\\Delta t_{s} \\le \\tau_{c}\\sqrt{3\\varepsilon}$;\n- choosing $t_{\\max}$ so that the tail fraction of a single-exponential integral is $\\mathrm{e}^{-t_{\\max}/\\tau_{c}} \\le \\varepsilon/4$, i.e., $t_{\\max} \\ge \\tau_{c}\\ln(4/\\varepsilon)$;\n- choosing $T$ so that the central-limit-theorem scaling for the Green–Kubo integral estimator’s relative standard error, $\\approx \\sqrt{2\\,t_{\\max}/T}$, does not exceed $\\varepsilon/2$, i.e., $T \\ge 8\\,t_{\\max}/\\varepsilon^{2}$.\n\nB. Choose $\\Delta t_{s}\\approx \\tau_{c}$ to minimize correlation between successive samples; choose $t_{\\max}\\approx \\tau_{c}$, and set $T \\ge \\tau_{c}/\\varepsilon$ so that the number of effectively independent samples scales like $1/\\varepsilon$. This keeps variance small without oversampling and avoids long integrations that add noise.\n\nC. Choose $\\Delta t_{s}$ as small as possible to minimize quadrature error, set $t_{\\max}=T$ so that all data contribute to the integral, and choose $T \\ge \\tau_{c}\\ln(4/\\varepsilon)$ so that the truncation bias would be at most $\\varepsilon$ if the correlation were exponential. The large $T$ will also reduce variance sufficiently.\n\nD. Choose a fixed resolution $\\Delta t_{s}=\\tau_{c}/5$ to resolve the decay, choose $t_{\\max}=\\tau_{c}\\ln(2/\\varepsilon)$ so the exponential tail contributes at most a fraction $\\varepsilon/2$, and set $T \\ge 2\\,t_{\\max}/\\varepsilon$ so the standard error falls like $1/\\sqrt{T}$ and meets the target for any $\\varepsilon$ while avoiding excessive computation.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically valid. It describes a standard and important procedure in computational statistical mechanics: the estimation of a transport coefficient via the Green-Kubo formula. The core of the problem lies in the analysis of numerical and statistical errors inherent in this procedure, based on a reasonable and explicitly stated physical model for the underlying correlation function. The question asks for a quantitatively consistent strategy to control these errors, which is a well-posed problem in numerical analysis and computational physics.\n\nLet us proceed with a systematic analysis.\n\nThe goal is to estimate the thermal conductivity $\\kappa$, which is proportional to the integral $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$. The control of the relative error in $I$ is equivalent to controlling the relative error in $\\kappa$. The problem assumes the heat flux autocorrelation function $C(t)$ follows a single-exponential decay:\n$$C(t) \\approx C(0)\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-t/\\tau_{c}}$$\nUnder this assumption, the true value of the integral is:\n$$I_{\\text{true}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(0)\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-t/\\tau_{c}}\\,\\mathrm{d}t = C(0)\\tau_{c}$$\nThe numerical estimation of $I$ from a finite simulation of total duration $T$ involves three primary sources of error that must be controlled:\n1.  **Truncation bias**, from truncating the integral at an upper limit $t_{\\max}  \\infty$.\n2.  **Discretization (quadrature) error**, from approximating the integral with a discrete sum using a time step $\\Delta t_{s}$.\n3.  **Statistical error (variance)**, from estimating $C(t)$ using a finite-duration trajectory of length $T$.\n\nThe total root-mean-square (RMS) relative error $\\varepsilon_{\\text{total}}$ is related to the relative bias $b_{\\text{rel}}$ and the relative standard error $\\sigma_{\\text{rel}}$ by:\n$$\\varepsilon_{\\text{total}}^2 = b_{\\text{rel}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\text{rel}}^2$$\nThe total relative bias is a sum of the truncation and discretization biases: $b_{\\text{rel}} = b_{\\text{trunc}} + b_{\\text{quad}}$. A robust error control strategy will ensure that $\\varepsilon_{\\text{total}} \\le \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the target relative error.\n\nLet us derive the expressions for each error component.\n\n**1. Truncation Bias**\nThe integral is calculated up to $t_{\\max}$, leading to a systematic underestimation. The error is the neglected tail of the integral:\n$$\\text{Error}_{\\text{trunc}} = \\int_{t_{\\max}}^{\\infty} C(0)\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-t/\\tau_{c}}\\,\\mathrm{d}t = C(0)\\tau_{c}\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-t_{\\max}/\\tau_{c}}$$\nThe relative truncation bias is the ratio of this error to the true integral value:\n$$b_{\\text{trunc}} = \\frac{\\text{Error}_{\\text{trunc}}}{I_{\\text{true}}} = \\frac{C(0)\\tau_{c}\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-t_{\\max}/\\tau_{c}}}{C(0)\\tau_{c}} = \\mathrm{e}^{-t_{\\max}/\\tau_{c}}$$\n\n**2. Discretization (Quadrature) Error**\nThe problem suggests using the composite trapezoidal rule. For a function $f(t)$ integrated from $0$ to $t_{\\max}$, the error is approximately $E_{\\text{quad}} \\approx -\\frac{t_{\\max}}{12}(\\Delta t_s)^2 \\bar{f''}$. A more precise formula from the Euler-Maclaurin series for the error in integrating $f(t)$ from $0$ to $t_{\\max}$ is $E_{\\text{quad}} \\approx \\frac{(\\Delta t_s)^2}{12}[f'(0) - f'(t_{\\max})]$.\nFor $f(t) = C(t) = C(0)\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-t/\\tau_{c}}$, we have $f'(t) = -\\frac{C(0)}{\\tau_{c}}\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-t/\\tau_{c}}$.\nThe absolute quadrature error is:\n$$E_{\\text{quad}} \\approx \\frac{(\\Delta t_s)^2}{12} \\left[ -\\frac{C(0)}{\\tau_{c}} - \\left(-\\frac{C(0)}{\\tau_{c}}\\mathrm{e}^{-t_{\\max}/\\tau_{c}}\\right) \\right] = -\\frac{C(0)(\\Delta t_s)^2}{12\\tau_{c}} (1 - \\mathrm{e}^{-t_{\\max}/\\tau_{c}})$$\nThe relative quadrature bias is:\n$$b_{\\text{quad}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{quad}}}{I_{\\text{true}}} = \\frac{-C(0)(\\Delta t_s)^2 (1 - \\mathrm{e}^{-t_{\\max}/\\tau_{c}})}{12\\tau_{c} \\cdot C(0)\\tau_{c}} = -\\frac{(\\Delta t_s/\\tau_{c})^2}{12}(1 - \\mathrm{e}^{-t_{\\max}/\\tau_{c}})$$\nSince a proper choice of $t_{\\max}$ will make $\\mathrm{e}^{-t_{\\max}/\\tau_{c}} \\ll 1$, the magnitude of the relative quadrature bias is well-approximated by:\n$$|b_{\\text{quad}}| \\approx \\frac{(\\Delta t_s/\\tau_{c})^2}{12}$$\n\n**3. Statistical Error**\nThe problem provides the expression for the relative standard error of the Green-Kubo integral estimator:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{rel}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2t_{\\max}}{T}}$$\nThis is a standard, albeit simplified, result in the literature on statistical analysis of time series, valid under the condition $\\tau_c \\ll t_{\\max} \\ll T$. It arises from treating the total simulation as a set of $T/t_{\\max}$ statistically \"block\" averages.\n\n**Error Budgeting Strategy**\nA sound strategy is to budget the total tolerated error $\\varepsilon$ among the different sources. There is no unique way to do this, but a common approach is to allocate fractions of the total error to each component. Let us analyze the strategy proposed in each option.\n\n**Evaluation of Option A**\nThis option proposes the following error budget:\n- Quadrature relative error: $|b_{\\text{quad}}| \\le \\varepsilon/4$\n- Truncation relative bias: $|b_{\\text{trunc}}| \\le \\varepsilon/4$\n- Statistical relative standard error: $\\sigma_{\\text{rel}} \\le \\varepsilon/2$\n\nLet's check if this budget meets the target. The total bias is bounded by $|b_{\\text{rel}}| \\le |b_{\\text{trunc}}| + |b_{\\text{quad}}| \\le \\varepsilon/4 + \\varepsilon/4 = \\varepsilon/2$.\nThe total RMS relative error is then bounded by $\\varepsilon_{\\text{total}} = \\sqrt{b_{\\text{rel}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\text{rel}}^2} \\le \\sqrt{(\\varepsilon/2)^2 + (\\varepsilon/2)^2} = \\sqrt{2\\varepsilon^2/4} = \\varepsilon/\\sqrt{2}  \\varepsilon$. This is a conservative and therefore safe budgeting scheme.\n\nNow we verify the quantitative conditions derived from this budget:\n- For quadrature error: $\\frac{(\\Delta t_s/\\tau_{c})^2}{12} \\le \\frac{\\varepsilon}{4} \\implies (\\Delta t_s/\\tau_{c})^2 \\le 3\\varepsilon \\implies \\Delta t_{s} \\le \\tau_{c}\\sqrt{3\\varepsilon}$. This matches the statement.\n- For truncation bias: $\\mathrm{e}^{-t_{\\max}/\\tau_{c}} \\le \\frac{\\varepsilon}{4} \\implies -t_{\\max}/\\tau_{c} \\le \\ln(\\varepsilon/4) \\implies t_{\\max}/\\tau_{c} \\ge -\\ln(\\varepsilon/4) = \\ln(4/\\varepsilon) \\implies t_{\\max} \\ge \\tau_{c}\\ln(4/\\varepsilon)$. This matches the statement.\n- For statistical error: $\\sqrt{2t_{\\max}/T} \\le \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2} \\implies \\frac{2t_{\\max}}{T} \\le \\frac{\\varepsilon^2}{4} \\implies T \\ge \\frac{8t_{\\max}}{\\varepsilon^2}$. This matches the statement.\n\nThe strategy described in Option A is quantitatively sound, internally consistent, and based on correct theoretical formulas for the different error sources. The proposal to use a pilot run to estimate $\\tau_c$ is also standard and necessary practice.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Evaluation of Option B**\n- $\\Delta t_{s} \\approx \\tau_c$: This choice is poor. It yields a relative quadrature error of $|b_{\\text{quad}}| \\approx (\\tau_c/\\tau_c)^2/12 = 1/12 \\approx 8.3\\%$. This systematic error is unacceptably large for any reasonably small $\\varepsilon$.\n- $t_{\\max} \\approx \\tau_c$: This is even worse. It results in a relative truncation bias of $b_{\\text{trunc}} = \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau_c/\\tau_c} = \\mathrm{e}^{-1} \\approx 0.37$, a massive $37\\%$ systematic error.\n- $T \\ge \\tau_c/\\varepsilon$: This scaling for $T$ is incorrect. As shown in the analysis of Option A, to control statistical error to be of order $\\varepsilon$, the total time $T$ must scale as $1/\\varepsilon^2$, not $1/\\varepsilon$.\nThis strategy guarantees large systematic errors and inadequately controls statistical error.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Evaluation of Option C**\n- $t_{\\max}=T$: This choice is fundamentally flawed. The statistical estimate of the autocorrelation function, $\\hat{C}(t) = \\frac{1}{T-t}\\int_0^{T-t} \\mathbf{J}_q(t'+t)\\cdot\\mathbf{J}_q(t')\\mathrm{d}t'$, becomes progressively noisier as $t$ approaches $T$ because the number of averaging samples, proportional to $T-t$, goes to zero. Integrating $\\hat{C}(t)$ all the way to $T$ incorporates this extremely noisy tail, which drastically increases the variance of the final integral estimate, invalidating the simple variance formula used earlier and destroying the precision of the result. For reliable estimates, one must always choose $t_{\\max} \\ll T$.\n- $T \\ge \\tau_{c}\\ln(4/\\varepsilon)$: This appears to conflate the condition for $t_{\\max}$ with the condition for $T$. The length of the simulation $T$ is primarily set to control statistical variance, not truncation bias. The reasoning is confused.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Evaluation of Option D**\n- $\\Delta t_{s}=\\tau_{c}/5$: This sets a fixed relative quadrature error of $(1/5)^2/12 \\approx 0.33\\%$. While perhaps acceptable for some $\\varepsilon$, a robust strategy should adapt $\\Delta t_s$ based on the target $\\varepsilon$, as in Option A.\n- $t_{\\max}=\\tau_{c}\\ln(2/\\varepsilon)$: This choice sets the truncation bias to $b_{\\text{trunc}} = \\mathrm{e}^{-\\ln(2/\\varepsilon)} = \\varepsilon/2$. This is a plausible (though possibly aggressive) budgeting choice, allocating half of the target error to bias.\n- $T \\ge 2\\,t_{\\max}/\\varepsilon$: This is the critical flaw. To find the resulting statistical error, we substitute this into the variance formula: $\\sigma_{\\text{rel}} = \\sqrt{2t_{\\max}/T} = \\sqrt{2t_{\\max} / (2t_{\\max}/\\varepsilon)} = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$. For a small target error, e.g., $\\varepsilon = 0.01$, this strategy yields a statistical error of $\\sigma_{\\text{rel}} = \\sqrt{0.01} = 0.1$, which is a $10\\%$ error, an order of magnitude larger than the target $\\varepsilon$. The correct scaling for $T$ to make $\\sigma_{\\text{rel}}$ proportional to $\\varepsilon$ must be $T \\propto 1/\\varepsilon^2$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, only Option A presents a complete, quantitatively correct, and defensible strategy for controlling all relevant sources of error to achieve a specified target precision.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2775084"}]}
