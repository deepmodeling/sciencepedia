It is a standard, well-posed problem in quantum scattering theory, free of scientific or mathematical flaws. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe starting point is the time-independent Schrödinger equation for the reduced radial wavefunction $u_{\\ell}(r) = r \\psi_{\\ell}(r)$, where $\\psi_{\\ell}(r)$ is the radial part of the full wavefunction. For $s$-wave scattering, the angular momentum quantum number is $\\ell=0$, and the centrifugal barrier term vanishes. The equation in three dimensions is:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} \\frac{d^2u_0(r)}{dr^2} + V(r) u_0(r) = E u_0(r) $$\nThe particle has reduced mass $\\mu$ and energy $E = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2\\mu}$, where $k$ is the wave number. The potential is the attractive square well, defined as $V(r) = -V_0$ for $r  R$ and $V(r) = 0$ for $r \\ge R$, with $V_0  0$.\n\nWe must solve this equation in two regions.\n\nRegion I: $r  R$\nIn this region, $V(r) = -V_0$. The Schrödinger equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u_I(r)}{dr^2} + \\frac{2\\mu(E+V_0)}{\\hbar^2} u_I(r) = 0 $$\nLet us define an interior wave number $q = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu(E+V_0)}{\\hbar^2}}$. The equation is then $\\frac{d^2u_I(r)}{dr^2} + q^2 u_I(r) = 0$. The general solution is $u_I(r) = A'\\sin(qr) + B'\\cos(qr)$. The physical wavefunction must be regular at the origin, which implies that $\\psi(r)$ is finite at $r=0$. Since $u(r) = r\\psi(r)$, we must have the regularity condition $u(r=0) = 0$. This condition forces $B'=0$. Thus, the solution inside the well is:\n$$ u_I(r) = A \\sin(qr) $$\n\nRegion II: $r \\ge R$\nIn this region, $V(r)=0$. The Schrödinger equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u_{II}(r)}{dr^2} + \\frac{2\\mu E}{\\hbar^2} u_{II}(r) = 0 $$\nUsing the definition $k = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu E}{\\hbar^2}}$, we have $\\frac{d^2u_{II}(r)}{dr^2} + k^2 u_{II}(r) = 0$. The general solution is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions. For scattering problems, it is convenient to write the solution in terms of a phase shift $\\delta_0(k)$. The asymptotic boundary condition for scattering defines $\\delta_0(k)$ through the large-$r$ behavior of the wavefunction. The solution for $r \\ge R$ that represents an outgoing scattered wave phase-shifted with respect to the incoming wave is:\n$$ u_{II}(r) = C \\sin(kr + \\delta_0(k)) $$\n\nThe next step is to match the solutions and their derivatives at the boundary $r=R$ to ensure the wavefunction is smooth.\nContinuity of $u(r)$: $u_I(R) = u_{II}(R)$\n$$ A \\sin(qR) = C \\sin(kR + \\delta_0) $$\nContinuity of $u'(r)$: $u_I'(R) = u_{II}'(R)$\n$$ Aq \\cos(qR) = Ck \\cos(kR + \\delta_0) $$\nTo eliminate the unknown constants $A$ and $C$, we divide the second equation by the first, provided $A\\sin(qR) \\neq 0$:\n$$ q \\cot(qR) = k \\cot(kR + \\delta_0) $$\nThis equation provides an exact implicit relation for the phase shift $\\delta_0(k)$. To find an explicit expression, we can solve for $\\tan(\\delta_0)$. A more convenient form is obtained by inverting the relation:\n$$ \\tan(kR+\\delta_0) = \\frac{k}{q} \\tan(qR) $$\nUsing the identity for the tangent of a sum, $\\tan(\\alpha+\\beta) = \\frac{\\tan\\alpha+\\tan\\beta}{1-\\tan\\alpha\\tan\\beta}$, we have:\n$$ \\frac{\\tan(kR) + \\tan(\\delta_0)}{1 - \\tan(kR)\\tan(\\delta_0)} = \\frac{k}{q} \\tan(qR) $$\nSolving for $\\tan(\\delta_0)$ gives the exact expression:\n$$ \\tan(\\delta_0) = \\frac{\\frac{k}{q}\\tan(qR) - \\tan(kR)}{1 + \\frac{k}{q}\\tan(qR)\\tan(kR)} $$\n\nWe are interested in the low-energy limit, where $kR \\ll 1$. In this limit, $k \\to 0$. The interior wave number $q$ approaches a constant value $q_0 = \\lim_{k\\to 0} q = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu V_0}{\\hbar^2}}$. We can approximate $\\tan(kR)$ by its leading-order Taylor series term, $\\tan(kR) \\approx kR$.\nSubstituting these approximations into the expression for $\\tan(\\delta_0)$:\n$$ \\tan(\\delta_0) \\approx \\frac{\\frac{k}{q_0}\\tan(q_0 R) - kR}{1 + \\frac{k}{q_0}\\tan(q_0 R)(kR)} $$\nThe numerator is of order $k$. The denominator is $1 + O(k^2)$. Therefore, to leading order in $k$, we can approximate the denominator as $1$:\n$$ \\tan(\\delta_0) \\approx k\\left(\\frac{\\tan(q_0 R)}{q_0} - R\\right) $$\nIn the low-energy limit, the phase shift $\\delta_0$ itself becomes small (assuming a convention where $\\delta_0 \\to 0$ as $V_0 \\to 0$). We can thus use the approximation $\\tan(\\delta_0) \\approx \\delta_0$. This yields the leading-order approximation for the $s$-wave phase shift:\n$$ \\delta_0(k) \\approx k\\left(\\frac{\\tan(q_0 R)}{q_0} - R\\right) $$\nSubstituting the definition of $q_0$, the expression is:\n$$ \\delta_0(k) \\approx k \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2\\mu V_0}} \\tan\\left(\\frac{R\\sqrt{2\\mu V_0}}{\\hbar}\\right) - R \\right) $$\n\nNow, for the analysis of this result. The behavior of $\\delta_0(k)$ is determined by the properties of the potential, encapsulated in the dimensionless parameter $q_0 R = \\frac{R}{\\hbar}\\sqrt{2\\mu V_0}$. As the well depth $V_0$ varies, $q_0 R$ changes, leading to qualitative changes in the scattering properties.\nThe key term is $\\tan(q_0 R)$. The tangent function has singularities. Specifically, $\\tan(q_0 R)$ diverges when its argument is an odd multiple of $\\pi/2$:\n$$ q_0 R = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\pi, \\quad n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\nAt these specific values of $V_0$ (for a fixed $R$), the approximation for $\\delta_0(k)$ becomes infinite. This phenomenon is known as a zero-energy resonance. Physically, these values of potential depth and range are precisely the conditions for the potential well to support a new $s$-wave bound state at exactly zero energy.\nWhen $q_0 R$ passes through one of these resonant values, the scattering length $a_0$, defined by $\\delta_0(k) \\approx -ka_0$, changes sign and its magnitude becomes very large. For an attractive potential, the phase shift is generally positive. As $q_0 R$ approaches a resonance from below (e.g., $q_0 R \\to \\pi/2^-$), $\\tan(q_0 R) \\to +\\infty$, and $\\delta_0(k)$ becomes very large and positive. Just after the resonance (e.g., $q_0 R \\to \\pi/2^+$), $\\tan(q_0 R) \\to -\\infty$, and $\\delta_0(k)$ becomes very large and negative (modulo $\\pi$). This dramatic change signals the capture of the particle into a new bound state. The number of $s$-wave bound states supported by the well increases by one each time $V_0$ is increased such that $q_0 R$ crosses a value of $(n+1/2)\\pi$.\nFurthermore, for particular values of $V_0$ and $R$ where $\\frac{\\tan(q_0 R)}{q_0} - R = 0$, or $\\tan(q_0 R) = q_0 R$, the phase shift $\\delta_0(k)$ becomes zero in this approximation. This leads to a near-zero scattering cross-section at low energies, a phenomenon analogous to the Ramsauer-Townsend effect.\nIn summary, the low-energy scattering behavior is not monotonic with potential strength but exhibits a rich resonant structure directly tied to the bound state spectrum of the potential.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{k \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2\\mu V_0}} \\tan\\left(\\frac{R\\sqrt{2\\mu V_0}}{\\hbar}\\right) - R \\right)}\n$$", "id": "2798204"}, {"introduction": "While exactly solvable models are rare, approximation methods provide powerful tools for analyzing more complex systems.

Second, we must derive the scattering amplitude for a regularized, screened potential. Third, we must recover the Coulomb scattering amplitude in a specific, well-defined limit.\n\nPart (a): The first Born approximation for the scattering amplitude $f^{(1)}(\\theta, \\phi)$ is given by the expression\n$$\nf^{(1)}(\\theta, \\phi) = -\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi\\hbar^{2}} \\int d^{3}r' V(\\mathbf{r}') \\exp(-i\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}')\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the reduced mass, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $V(\\mathbf{r}')$ is the scattering potential, and $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{k}_{f} - \\mathbf{k}_{i}$ is the momentum transfer vector, with $\\mathbf{k}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{k}_{f}$ being the incident and final wave vectors, respectively.

Its validity rests on the assumption that the scattered wave is a small perturbation to the incident plane wave. This is generally true for potentials that are \"weak\" or for high incident energies. A more formal condition is that the potential must be short-ranged, meaning it must fall off sufficiently fast at large distances $r$. A common requirement for the applicability of the standard scattering formalism, including the first Born approximation, is that the potential $V(r)$ must satisfy $\\int_{a}^{\\infty} |V(r)| dr  \\infty$ for some radius $a$, and ideally that $rV(r) \\to 0$ as $r \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe Coulomb potential, $V(r) = C/r$, violates this condition. It is a long-range potential. The integral $\\int^{\\infty} |C/r| dr$ diverges logarithmically. Physically, a long-range potential modifies the state of the particle even at arbitrarily large distances. The true asymptotic wave functions are not plane waves $\\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})$, but are distorted by a logarithmic phase factor.
