We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the donor-acceptor separation distance $R$ at which the Dexter exchange energy transfer rate decreases by a specific factor. The derivation must start from the fundamental principles provided.\n\nFirst, according to the Fermi Golden Rule (FGR), the rate of a nonadiabatic transition, $k$, is proportional to the square of the electronic coupling matrix element, $V$, between the initial and final states, and to the spectral density, $J$. This is expressed as:\n$$\nk \\propto |V|^2 J\n$$\nThe problem specifies a fixed spectral density, so we can treat $J$ as a constant. Therefore, the rate's dependence is solely on the electronic coupling:\n$$\nk \\propto |V|^2\n$$\nSecond, for the Dexter exchange mechanism, the electronic coupling $V_{\\text{Dexter}}$ arises from a two-electron exchange interaction. This interaction's magnitude is directly proportional to the spatial overlap of the donor's and acceptor's frontier molecular orbitals involved in the transition. Let this orbital overlap integral be denoted as $S_{DA}$. Thus, we have:\n$$\nV_{\\text{Dexter}} \\propto S_{DA}\n$$\nCombining these two proportionalities, we find the relationship between the Dexter transfer rate, $k_{\\text{Dexter}}$, and the orbital overlap:\n$$\nk_{\\text{Dexter}} \\propto |V_{\\text{Dexter}}|^2 \\propto |S_{DA}|^2\n$$\nThird, we must determine how the orbital overlap, $S_{DA}$, depends on the intermolecular separation distance, $R$. The problem states that the frontier orbitals decay exponentially from their respective molecular centers with a characteristic decay length $L$:\n$$\n|\\psi(\\mathbf{r})| \\propto \\exp(-r/L)\n$$\nThe overlap integral, $S_{DA}$, is a two-center integral involving the product of the donor and acceptor wavefunctions. For two such exponentially decaying functions separated by a distance $R$, the overlap integral itself is known to scale exponentially with the separation. The dominant dependence is given by:\n$$\nS_{DA}(R) \\propto \\exp(-R/L)\n$$\nSubstituting this distance dependence of the overlap into our expression for the rate gives the scaling law for Dexter transfer:\n$$\nk_{\\text{Dexter}}(R) \\propto |S_{DA}(R)|^2 \\propto \\left( \\exp(-R/L) \\right)^2 = \\exp(-2R/L)\n$$\nThis is the characteristic short-range nature of the Dexter mechanism. We can express the rate at any separation $R$ relative to the rate at contact ($R=0$). Let $k_{\\text{Dexter}}(0)$ be the rate at $R=0$. Then the rate at distance $R$ is:\n$$\nk_{\\text{Dexter}}(R) = k_{\\text{Dexter}}(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2R}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires finding the distance $R$ at which the rate has decreased by a factor of $\\exp(-4)$ relative to its contact value.
