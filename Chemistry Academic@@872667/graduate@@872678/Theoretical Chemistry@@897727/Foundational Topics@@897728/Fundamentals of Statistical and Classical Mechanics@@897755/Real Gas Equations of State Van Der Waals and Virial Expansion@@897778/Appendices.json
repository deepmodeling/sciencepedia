It is a standard problem in statistical thermodynamics, and I shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe pressure $P$ of a classical gas of $N$ particles in a volume $V$ at temperature $T$ can be expressed via the virial expansion in terms of the number density $\\rho = N/V$:\n$$ \\frac{P}{k_{B}T} = \\rho + B_{2}(T)\\rho^{2} + B_{3}(T)\\rho^{3} + \\cdots $$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $B_{n}(T)$ are the temperature-dependent virial coefficients. The second virial coefficient $B_{2}(T)$ accounts for the leading-order correction to ideal-gas behavior due to pairwise interactions between particles. From the cluster expansion formalism in the canonical ensemble, $B_{2}(T)$ is given by an integral over the Mayer $f$-function, which is defined as $f(r) = \\exp(-\\beta u(r)) - 1$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_{B}T)$ and $u(r)$ is the pair potential.\n\nThe general expression for the second virial coefficient is:\n$$ B_{2}(T) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int f(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d^{3}r $$\nHere, the integral is over the relative position vector $\\mathbf{r}$ of a pair of particles. For a spherically symmetric potential $u(r)$, where $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$, the Mayer function $f$ also depends only on the magnitude $r$.\n\nThe problem specifies a hard-sphere potential, given by:\n$$ u(r) = \\begin{cases} +\\infty & \\text{for } r < \\sigma \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } r \\ge \\sigma \\end{cases} $$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the diameter of the hard spheres. We must first determine the form of the Mayer function $f(r)$ for this potential.\n\nFor $r < \\sigma$, the potential $u(r) = +\\infty$. The argument of the exponential is $-\\beta u(r) = -\\infty$. Therefore:\n$$ f(r) = \\exp(-\\infty) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1 \\quad (\\text{for } r < \\sigma) $$\nFor $r \\ge \\sigma$, the potential $u(r) = 0$. The argument of the exponential is $-\\beta u(r) = 0$. Therefore:\n$$ f(r) = \\exp(0) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \\quad (\\text{for } r \\ge \\sigma) $$\nCombining these two cases, the Mayer function for a hard-sphere gas is a simple step function:\n$$ f(r) = \\begin{cases} -1 & \\text{for } r < \\sigma \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } r \\ge \\sigma \\end{cases} $$\nAn important consequence is that $f(r)$ for the hard-sphere model is independent of temperature $T$, which means $B_{2}$ will also be independent of temperature.\n\nNow we can evaluate the integral for $B_{2}(T)$. We will use spherical coordinates for the volume element $d^{3}r = r^{2}\\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$.\n$$ B_{2}(T) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{2} f(r) \\, dr $$\nThe integrals over the angles $\\phi$ and $\\theta$ yield $2\\pi$ and $2$ respectively, for a total factor of $4\\pi$.\n$$ B_{2}(T) = -\\frac{1}{2} (4\\pi) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{2} f(r) \\, dr = -2\\pi \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{2} f(r) \\, dr $$\nNext, we substitute the piecewise definition of $f(r)$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{2} f(r) \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{\\sigma} r^{2} (-1) \\, dr + \\int_{\\sigma}^{\\infty} r^{2} (0) \\, dr $$\nThe second integral is zero.

As predicted, it is a constant, independent of temperature.\n\nFor the interpretation, we analyze the physical meaning of this result. The positive sign of $B_{2}$ indicates that the net effect of the interaction is repulsive, leading to a pressure that is higher than that of an ideal gas at the same density and temperature. This is expected for hard spheres, which only experience repulsion. The quantity $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3}$ represents the volume of a sphere of radius $\\sigma$. This is the \"excluded volume\" for the center of one hard sphere due to the presence of another. The center of any sphere is excluded from a sphere of radius $\\sigma$ centered on any other sphere.\nThe coefficient $B_{2}$ is equal to one-half of this excluded volume for a pair of particles:\n$$ B_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\left( \\text{Volume of sphere of radius } \\sigma \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3}\\right) $$\nThe factor of $1/2$ arises from the definition of $B_{2}$, which is concerned with pairwise interactions and avoids double-counting.\nIt is also instructive to relate $B_{2}$ to the volume of a single particle, $v_{\\text{particle}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (\\sigma/2)^{3} = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi\\sigma^{3}$.\n$$ B_{2} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3} = 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{6}\\pi\\sigma^{3} \\right) = 4 v_{\\text{particle}} $$\nThus, the second virial coefficient for hard spheres is four times the volume of a single particle.\n\nFinally, we connect this result to the van der Waals equation of state, which on a per-mole basis is $\\left(P + a/V_{m}^{2}\\right)(V_{m}-b) = RT$. By expanding this equation in powers of the inverse molar volume $1/V_{m}$ (equivalent to density), one finds the second virial coefficient for a van der Waals gas to be $B_{2}^{\\text{vdW}}(T) = b - a/(RT)$. The parameter $a$ accounts for attractive forces, and the parameter $b$ accounts for the finite size of the particles, the \"co-volume\". The hard-sphere model has no attractive forces, which corresponds to setting $a=0$. Thus, for a gas of hard spheres treated with the van der Waals equation, we would have $B_{2} = b$.\nBy comparing our first-principles result with the van der Waals model, we identify the molar co-volume parameter $b$ as:\n$$ b = N_{A} B_{2} = N_{A} \\left( \\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3} \\right) = 4 \\left( N_{A} \\frac{1}{6}\\pi\\sigma^{3} \\right) $$\nwhere $N_{A}$ is the Avogadro constant. This shows that the van der Waals parameter $b$ corresponds to four times the total physical volume of the particles in one mole, a classic result of statistical mechanics that is rigorously confirmed by this derivation.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3}} $$", "id": "2800866"}, {"introduction": "Having modeled pure repulsion, we now introduce attractive forces, which are essential for describing gas condensation.

We use the parametrizations $T_r = 1 + \\tau$ and $v_r = 1 + \\varphi$, where $|\\tau| \\ll 1$ and $|\\varphi| \\ll 1$.\n$$ p_r = \\frac{8(1 + \\tau)}{3(1 + \\varphi) - 1} - \\frac{3}{(1 + \\varphi)^{2}} = \\frac{8(1 + \\tau)}{2 + 3\\varphi} - \\frac{3}{(1 + \\varphi)^{2}} $$\nWe perform a Taylor expansion for small $\\varphi$ and $\\tau$.\nThe first term:\n$$ \\frac{8(1+\\tau)}{2+3\\varphi} = 4(1+\\tau) \\left(1 + \\frac{3}{2}\\varphi\\right)^{-1} = 4(1+\\tau)\\left(1 - \\frac{3}{2}\\varphi + \\frac{9}{4}\\varphi^2 - \\frac{27}{8}\\varphi^3 + O(\\varphi^4)\\right) $$\n$$ = 4\\left(1 - \\frac{3}{2}\\varphi + \\frac{9}{4}\\varphi^2 - \\frac{27}{2}\\varphi^3\\right) + 4\\tau\\left(1 - \\frac{3}{2}\\varphi\\right) + O(\\varphi^4, \\tau\\varphi^2) $$\n$$ = 4 - 6\\varphi + 9\\varphi^2 - \\frac{27}{2}\\varphi^3 + 4\\tau - 6\\tau\\varphi + \\dots $$\nThe second term:\n$$ -3(1+\\varphi)^{-2} = -3\\left(1 - 2\\varphi + 3\\varphi^2 - 4\\varphi^3 + O(\\varphi^4)\\right) = -3 + 6\\varphi - 9\\varphi^2 + 12\\varphi^3 + \\dots $$\nCombining the terms and keeping orders up to $\\varphi^3$ and $\\tau\\varphi$:\n$$ p_r(\\varphi, \\tau) = (4 - 6\\varphi + 9\\varphi^2 - \\frac{27}{2}\\varphi^3) + (-3 + 6\\varphi - 9\\varphi^2 + 12\\varphi^3) + 4\\tau - 6\\tau\\varphi + \\dots $$\n$$ p_r(\\varphi, \\tau) = 1 + 4\\tau - 6\\tau\\varphi - \\frac{3}{2}\\varphi^3 + \\dots $$\nThis is the required expansion. It is a form of the Landau free energy expansion for this system.\n\n3) We use the expanded equation of state to find the spinodal and binodal points for a fixed subcritical temperature, $T_r < 1$, which corresponds to $\\tau < 0$.\n\nSpinodal points $(\\varphi_{s,\\pm})$ are defined by $(\\partial p_r/\\partial \\varphi)_{T_r} = 0$. Differentiating the expansion with respect to $\\varphi$ at constant $\\tau$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial p_r}{\\partial \\varphi}\\right)_{\\tau} = -6\\tau - \\frac{9}{2}\\varphi^2 $$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$ -6\\tau - \\frac{9}{2}\\varphi^2 = 0 \\implies \\varphi^2 = -\\frac{2}{9}(6\\tau) = -\\frac{4}{3}\\tau $$\nSince $\\tau < 0$, $\\varphi^2$ is positive. The two spinodal points are:\n$$ \\varphi_{s,\\pm} = \\pm \\sqrt{-\\frac{4\\tau}{3}} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\tau}{3}} $$\n\nBinodal points $(\\varphi_{b,\\pm})$ are determined by the Maxwell equal-area construction, which requires mechanical equilibrium, $p_r(\\varphi_{b,-}) = p_r(\\varphi_{b,+})$, and chemical equilibrium, $\\int_{\\varphi_{b,-}}^{\\varphi_{b,+}} p_r(\\varphi) d\\varphi = p_{r, \\text{coex}}(\\varphi_{b,+} - \\varphi_{b,-})$. For a cubic polynomial of the form $p_r(\\varphi) = A\\varphi^3 + B\\varphi^2 + C\\varphi + D$, the Maxwell construction implies that the midpoint of the binodal points, $(\\varphi_{b,-} + \\varphi_{b,+})/2$, must coincide with the inflection point of the polynomial.\nOur expansion is $p_r(\\varphi, \\tau) = -\\frac{3}{2}\\varphi^3 - 6\\tau\\varphi + (1+4\\tau)$. This is a cubic in $\\varphi$ with no quadratic term. The second derivative is $(\\partial^2 p_r/\\partial \\varphi^2)_{\\tau} = -9\\varphi$, which is zero only at $\\varphi=0$. Thus, the inflection point is at $\\varphi=0$.\nThis symmetry dictates that $\\frac{\\varphi_{b,-} + \\varphi_{b,+}}{2} = 0$, which implies $\\varphi_{b,-} = -\\varphi_{b,+}$.\nLet $\\varphi_{b,+} = \\varphi_b$ and $\\varphi_{b,-} = -\\varphi_b$. Now we apply the condition of mechanical equilibrium, $p_r(\\varphi_b) = p_r(-\\varphi_b)$:\n$$ 1 + 4\\tau - 6\\tau\\varphi_b - \\frac{3}{2}\\varphi_b^3 = 1 + 4\\tau - 6\\tau(-\\varphi_b) - \\frac{3}{2}(-\\varphi_b)^3 $$\n$$ -6\\tau\\varphi_b - \\frac{3}{2}\\varphi_b^3 = 6\\tau\\varphi_b + \\frac{3}{2}\\varphi_b^3 $$\n$$ 12\\tau\\varphi_b + 3\\varphi_b^3 = 0 \\implies 3\\varphi_b(4\\tau + \\varphi_b^2) = 0 $$\nThe non-trivial solution (for $\\varphi_b \\neq 0$) is $\\varphi_b^2 = -4\\tau$. Since $\\tau < 0$, $\\varphi_b$ is real. The two binodal points are:\n$$ \\varphi_{b,\\pm} = \\pm \\sqrt{-4\\tau} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{-\\tau} $$\n\n4) We now determine the ratio of the binodal and spinodal separations in the limit $\\tau \\to 0^{-}$.\nThe spinodal separation is $\\Delta v_{\\text{sp}} = v_{s,+} - v_{s,-} = v_c(v_{r,s,+} - v_{r,s,-}) = v_c(\\varphi_{s,+} - \\varphi_{s,-})$.\n$$ \\Delta v_{\\text{sp}} = v_c \\left( 2\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\tau}{3}} - \\left(-2\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\tau}{3}}\\right) \\right) = v_c \\cdot 4\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\tau}{3}} $$\nThe binodal separation is $\\Delta v_{\\text{bi}} = v_{b,+} - v_{b,-} = v_c(v_{r,b,+} - v_{r,b,-}) = v_c(\\varphi_{b,+} - \\varphi_{b,-})$.\n$$ \\Delta v_{\\text{bi}} = v_c \\left( 2\\sqrt{-\\tau} - (-2\\sqrt{-\\tau}) \\right) = v_c \\cdot 4\\sqrt{-\\tau} $$\nThe ratio of these separations is:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta v_{\\text{bi}}}{\\Delta v_{\\text{sp}}} = \\frac{v_c \\cdot 4\\sqrt{-\\tau}}{v_c \\cdot 4\\sqrt{-\\tau/3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{-\\tau}}{\\sqrt{-\\tau/3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{-\\tau}}{\\sqrt{-\\tau} \\cdot \\sqrt{1/3}} = \\frac{1}{1/\\sqrt{3}} = \\sqrt{3} $$\nThis ratio is a constant independent of $\\tau$ in the vicinity of the critical point. Therefore, the limit is this constant value.\n\n$$ \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^{-}} \\frac{\\Delta v_{\\text{bi}}}{\\Delta v_{\\text{sp}}} = \\sqrt{3} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}$$", "id": "2800871"}]}
