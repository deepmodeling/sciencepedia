For $T > 0$, the condition $(\\partial S/\\partial T)_{V} > 0$ requires $(a+1)k_{B} > 0$, which simplifies to $a > -1$. This demonstrates that the condition for thermodynamic stability ($C_V>0$) and for entropy to be a well-behaved increasing function of temperature is identical to the condition for the convergence of the partition function.

When the partition between two identical gases at the same temperature and density is removed, the final state is macroscopically indistinguishable from the sum of the initial states. The entropy, being an extensive state function, is $S(2N, 2V, T) = 2 S(N, V, T)$.
