A spin-up particle contributes $+\\mu$ and a spin-down particle contributes $-\\mu$:\n$$ M(B) = \\mu \\bar{N}_{+} - \\mu \\bar{N}_{-} = 2\\mu [f(\\varepsilon_{+}) - f(\\varepsilon_{-})] $$\n\nThe linear magnetic susceptibility under Fermi-Dirac statistics, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}}$, is defined as the first derivative of the magnetization with respect to the magnetic field, evaluated at $B=0$:\n$$ \\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}} = \\left.\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial B}\\right|_{B=0} $$\nWe compute the derivative of $M(B)$ using the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial B} = 2\\mu \\left[ \\frac{\\partial f(\\varepsilon_{+})}{\\partial B} - \\frac{\\partial f(\\varepsilon_{-})}{\\partial B} \\right] $$\nThe derivatives of the energy levels are $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{+}}{\\partial B} = -\\mu$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{-}}{\\partial B} = +\\mu$. This gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial B} = 2\\mu \\left[ \\left(\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{+}}\\right) \\cdot (-\\mu) - \\left(\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{-}}\\right) \\cdot (+\\mu) \\right] = -2\\mu^{2} \\left[ \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{+}} + \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{-}} \\right] $$\nTo find $\\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}}$, we evaluate this expression at $B=0$. At $B=0$, we have $\\varepsilon_{+} = \\varepsilon_{-} = \\varepsilon_{0}$:\n$$ \\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}} = -2\\mu^{2} \\left[ \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{0}} + \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\right] = -4\\mu^{2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{0}} $$\nThe derivative of the FD distribution function with respect to energy is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f(\\epsilon)}{\\partial \\epsilon} = -\\frac{\\beta \\exp(\\beta(\\epsilon - \\mu_{\\mathrm{c}}))}{(1 + \\exp(\\beta(\\epsilon - \\mu_{\\mathrm{c}})))^{2}} $$\nThis can be expressed in terms of $f(\\epsilon)$ as $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon} = -\\beta f(\\epsilon)(1-f(\\epsilon))$. The problem defines $f_{0}$ as the FD occupation at zero field for energy $\\varepsilon_{0}$, i.e., $f_{0} = f(\\varepsilon_{0})$. Therefore:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{0}} = -\\beta f_{0}(1 - f_{0}) $$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}}$:\n$$ \\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}} = -4\\mu^{2} [-\\beta f_{0}(1 - f_{0})] = 4\\mu^{2}\\beta f_{0}(1 - f_{0}) $$\n\nNext, we evaluate the MB Curie susceptibility, which is defined as $\\chi_{\\mathrm{MB}} \\equiv \\mu^{2} \\beta \\,\\bar{N}_{0}$. We must first find the zero-field mean particle number, $\\bar{N}_{0}$. At $B=0$, the system has $4$ degenerate states, each with energy $\\varepsilon_{0}$. The occupation of each of these states is $f_{0}$. The total mean number of particles is:\n$$ \\bar{N}_{0} = 4 \\times f_{0} = 4f_{0} $$\nUsing the given definition of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{MB}}$:\n$$ \\chi_{\\mathrm{MB}} = \\mu^{2}\\beta \\bar{N}_{0} = \\mu^{2}\\beta (4f_{0}) = 4\\mu^{2}\\beta f_{0} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio $\\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}}/\\chi_{\\mathrm{MB}}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}}}{\\chi_{\\mathrm{MB}}} = \\frac{4\\mu^{2}\\beta f_{0}(1 - f_{0})}{4\\mu^{2}\\beta f_{0}} $$\nFor any physically meaningful system where particles can exist ($f_{0} > 0$), we can simplify this expression by canceling the common terms $4\\mu^{2}\\beta f_{0}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}}}{\\chi_{\\mathrm{MB}}} = 1 - f_{0} $$\nThis result shows that the susceptibility for fermions is reduced from the classical (MB) value by a factor $(1 - f_{0})$, which accounts for the Pauli exclusion principle: a particle can only be excited to a higher-energy spin state if that state is unoccupied, an event with probability $(1 - f_{0})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - f_{0}}$$", "id": "2798469"}]}
