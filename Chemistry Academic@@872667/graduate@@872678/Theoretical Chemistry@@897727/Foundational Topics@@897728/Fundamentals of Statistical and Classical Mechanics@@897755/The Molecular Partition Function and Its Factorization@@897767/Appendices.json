It requires the application of fundamental principles of the canonical ensemble to model the vibrational properties of diatomic molecules. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system consists of noninteracting diatomic molecules, so we can analyze a single molecule's partition function. According to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the total molecular partition function $q$ can be factorized into contributions from different degrees of freedom: translational ($q_{\\mathrm{trans}}$), rotational ($q_{\\mathrm{rot}}$), vibrational ($q_{\\mathrm{vib}}$), and electronic ($q_{\\mathrm{elec}}$). The problem states that the electronic ground state is isolated and non-degenerate, so $q_{\\mathrm{elec}}$ is a constant which we can set to $1$. The rotational states are assumed to be independent of the vibrational states. Therefore, the population of vibrational levels is determined solely by the vibrational partition function and the temperature.\n\nIn the canonical ensemble, the probability $P_v$ of finding a molecule in a specific vibrational state $v$ with energy $E_v$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$P_v = \\frac{g_v \\exp(-\\beta E_v)}{q_{\\mathrm{vib}}}$$\nwhere $g_v$ is the degeneracy of the level $v$, $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$ is the inverse thermal energy with $k_B$ being the Boltzmann constant, and $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is the vibrational partition function, $q_{\\mathrm{vib}} = \\sum_v g_v \\exp(-\\beta E_v)$. For a large number $N$ of molecules, the population of a level $v$ is $N_v = N P_v$. The ratio of the populations of the first excited vibrational state ($v=1$) to the ground state ($v=0$) is therefore:\n$$\\frac{N_1}{N_0} = \\frac{N P_1}{N P_0} = \\frac{g_1 \\exp(-\\beta E_1) / q_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{g_0 \\exp(-\\beta E_0) / q_{\\mathrm{vib}}} = \\frac{g_1}{g_0} \\exp(-\\beta(E_1 - E_0))$$\nThe vibrational motion is modeled as a quantum harmonic oscillator, whose energy levels are non-degenerate, so $g_v = 1$ for all $v$. The energy levels are given by $E_v = h c \\tilde{\\nu} \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is the spectroscopic wavenumber, and $v = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the vibrational quantum number.\nThe energy of the ground state is $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2} h c \\tilde{\\nu}$ and the energy of the first excited state is $E_1 = \\frac{3}{2} h c \\tilde{\\nu}$. The energy difference is $\\Delta E = E_1 - E_0 = h c \\tilde{\\nu}$.\nThe population ratio simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{N_1}{N_0} = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta E) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h c \\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the temperature $T_{\\ast}$**\n\nThe problem defines the temperature $T_{\\ast}$ as the temperature at which the ratio $\\frac{N_1}{N_0}$ equals $0.10$. We set this condition and solve for $T_{\\ast}$:\n$$0.10 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h c \\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T_{\\ast}}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(0.10) = -\\frac{h c \\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T_{\\ast}}$$\nSince $\\ln(0.10) = \\ln(10^{-1}) = -\\ln(10)$, we have:\n$$-\\ln(10) = -\\frac{h c \\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T_{\\ast}}$$\nSolving for $T_{\\ast}$ gives the first required expression:\n$$T_{\\ast} = \\frac{h c \\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B \\ln(10)}$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the temperature in Kelvin, as all constants would be in SI units for a numerical calculation.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the heat capacity ratio $C_{V,\\mathrm{vib}}(T_{\\ast})/R$**\n\nTo find the vibrational contribution to the molar heat capacity, we first must derive the average vibrational energy. This begins with the vibrational partition function $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ for the harmonic oscillator. Measuring energies from the bottom of the potential well, $E_v = h c \\tilde{\\nu} \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{vib}} = \\sum_{v=0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta E_v) = \\sum_{v=0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\beta h c \\tilde{\\nu}\\left(v+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$q_{\\mathrm{vib}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta h c \\tilde{\\nu}}{2}\\right) \\sum_{v=0}^{\\infty} \\left[\\exp(-\\beta h c \\tilde{\\nu})\\right]^v$$\nThe sum is a geometric series $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^k = \\frac{1}{1-x}$ with $x = \\exp(-\\beta h c \\tilde{\\nu})$.

It is well-posed, scientifically grounded in the principles of the Born–Oppenheimer and Rigid Rotor Harmonic Oscillator approximations, and its stated assumptions, while simplifying physical reality, serve a clear pedagogical purpose: to isolate the contribution of rotational symmetry to a chemical equilibrium. We shall now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental connection between the macroscopic properties of a system, such as the equilibrium constant, and the microscopic properties of its constituent molecules is established through the canonical partition function. For a single molecule, the partition function, $q$, is defined as the sum over all its quantum states $i$, weighted by their Boltzmann factors:\n$$ q = \\sum_{i} g_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon_i}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_i$ is the energy of state $i$, $g_i$ is its degeneracy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nWithin the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, the electronic and nuclear motions are considered separable. Furthermore, if we assume the molecular energy can be expressed as a sum of independent contributions from translation, rotation, vibration, and electronic states, then:\n$$ E_{\\text{total}} = E_{\\text{trans}} + E_{\\text{rot}} + E_{\\text{vib}} + E_{\\text{elec}} $$\nThis additivity in energy leads to a multiplicative factorization of the molecular partition function:\n$$ q = q_{\\text{trans}} q_{\\text{rot}} q_{\\text{vib}} q_{\\text{elec}} $$\n\nThe central part of this problem concerns the rotational partition function, $q_{\\text{rot}}$. In the high-temperature limit, where the rotational energy spacing is small compared to $k_B T$, the sum over discrete rotational energy levels can be replaced by an integral. For a linear molecule, this yields:\n$$ q'_{\\text{rot}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (2J+1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h^2 J(J+1)}{8 \\pi^2 I k_B T}\\right) dJ \\approx \\frac{8 \\pi^2 I k_B T}{h^2} $$\nwhere $I$ is the moment of inertia and $J$ is the rotational quantum number.\n\nThis classical expression, however, overcounts the number of accessible unique quantum states for molecules containing identical nuclei, such as $\\mathrm{H_2}$ and $\\mathrm{D_2}$. The Pauli exclusion principle mandates that the total wavefunction of a system must be either symmetric (for bosons) or antisymmetric (for fermions) with respect to the exchange of any pair of identical particles. For a homonuclear diatomic molecule, the nuclei are identical. The total nuclear wavefunction, which is approximately a product of rotational and nuclear spin wavefunctions ($\\Psi_{\\text{nuclear}} \\approx \\psi_{\\text{rot}} \\psi_{\\text{ns}}$), must obey this symmetry requirement. This coupling restricts the allowed combinations of rotational states (with symmetry $(-1)^J$) and nuclear spin states.\n\nIn the high-temperature limit, the net effect of these quantum symmetry constraints is a simple division of the classical rotational partition function by a factor known as the symmetry number, $\\sigma$. The symmetry number is the number of indistinguishable orientations of the molecule that can be generated by rigid rotations. The corrected rotational partition function is therefore:\n$$ q_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{q'_{\\text{rot}}}{\\sigma} = \\frac{8 \\pi^2 I k_B T}{\\sigma h^2} $$\n\nWe now determine the symmetry number for each species in the reaction:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $\\mathrm{H_2}$ and $\\mathrm{D_2}$: These are homonuclear diatomic molecules. A rotation by $\\pi$ radians ($180^\\circ$) about an axis perpendicular to the bond axis exchanges the two identical nuclei, resulting in a configuration that is physically indistinguishable from the initial one. The rotational symmetry group is $D_{\\infty h}$, which contains two rotational symmetry operations that map the molecule onto itself: the identity ($E$) and the $C_2$ rotation. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 2$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{D_2}} = 2$.\n    \\item For $\\mathrm{HD}$: This is a heteronuclear diatomic molecule. The two nuclei, H and D, are distinguishable isotopes. Rotation by $\\pi$ radians results in a configuration that is distinguishable from the original. Only the identity operation leaves the orientation unchanged. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{HD}} = 1$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the gas-phase reaction $\\mathrm{H_2} + \\mathrm{D_2} \\rightleftharpoons 2\\,\\mathrm{HD}$ is given by statistical mechanics as:\n$$ K = \\frac{\\left(q_{\\mathrm{HD}}/V\\right)^2}{\\left(q_{\\mathrm{H_2}}/V\\right)\\left(q_{\\mathrm{D_2}}/V\\right)} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_0}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $q_X$ is the full molecular partition function for species $X$, $V$ is the volume, and $\\Delta E_0$ is the change in ground-state energy.\n\nTo find the multiplicative factor by which rotational symmetry alone modifies this equilibrium constant, we compare the actual constant, $K$, with a hypothetical constant, $K_{\\text{no sym}}$, calculated without considering symmetry (i.e., assuming $\\sigma = 1$ for all species).\n\nThe ratio of these two constants gives the desired factor:\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{K}{K_{\\text{no sym}}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $K$ and $K_{\\text{no sym}}$, all contributions from translation, vibration, electronic states, and the zero-point energy term will cancel out, as will the parts of the rotational partition functions without the symmetry number, $q'_{\\text{rot}}$.\n$$ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{\n\\frac{\\left(q'_{\\text{rot},\\mathrm{HD}}/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{HD}}\\right)^2}{\\left(q'_{\\text{rot},\\mathrm{H_2}}/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2}}\\right)\\left(q'_{\\text{rot},\\mathrm{D_2}}/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{D_2}}\\right)}\n}{\n\\frac{\\left(q'_{\\text{rot},\\mathrm{HD}}\\right)^2}{\\left(q'_{\\text{rot},\\mathrm{H_2}}\\right)\\left(q'_{\\text{rot},\\mathrm{D_2}}\\right)}\n} = \\frac{\\frac{1/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{HD}}^2}{1/(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2}}\\sigma_{\\mathrm{D_2}})}}{1} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2}}\\sigma_{\\mathrm{D_2}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{HD}}^2} $$\nThis result isolates the effect of rotational symmetry as requested by the problem statement.

The integration limits change from $[0, 2\\pi]$ to $[0, 2n\\pi]$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos(n\\phi)) d\\phi = \\frac{1}{n} \\int_{0}^{2n\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos(u)) du\n$$\nSince $\\cos(u)$ is periodic with period $2\\pi$, the integral over $[0, 2n\\pi]$ is $n$ times the integral over $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} \\int_{0}^{2n\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos(u)) du = \\frac{n}{n} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos(u)) du = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos(u)) du\n$$\nThis integral defines the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero, $I_0(z)$, via the relation:\n$$\nI_0(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos\\theta) d\\theta\n$$\nThus, the angular integral evaluates to $2\\pi I_0(z) = 2\\pi I_0(\\beta V_0/2)$.\nThe full coordinate integral is $2\\pi \\exp(-\\beta V_0/2) I_0(\\beta V_0/2)$.\n\nCombining the momentum and coordinate integral results, we obtain the final closed-form expression for the torsional partition function:\n$$\nq_{\\text{tors}}(T) = \\frac{1}{nh} \\left(\\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}\\right) \\left(2\\pi \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta V_0}{2}\\right) I_0\\left(\\frac{\\beta V_0}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nExpressing $\\beta$ in terms of $T$ and $k_B$, this is:\n$$\nq_{\\text{tors}}(T) = \\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}}{nh} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_0}{2k_B T}\\right) I_0\\left(\\frac{V_0}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\n(iii) Asymptotic Analysis\n\nWe now analyze the behavior of this expression in the specified limits.\n\nLimit 1: Free internal rotor ($V_0 \\to 0$).\nIn this limit, the argument of the exponential and Bessel functions, $z = V_0 / (2k_B T)$, tends to zero. We use the small-argument expansion for these functions:\nAs $z \\to 0$, $\\exp(-z) \\to 1$ and $I_0(z) \\to I_0(0) = 1$.\nSubstituting these into our result for $q_{\\text{tors}}(T)$:\n$$\nq_{\\text{tors}}(T) \\xrightarrow{V_0 \\to 0} \\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}}{nh} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}}{nh}\n$$\nThis is the correct classical partition function for a one-dimensional free rotor with moment of inertia $I$ and symmetry number $n$, obtained from $q_{\\text{FR}} = \\frac{1}{nh} (\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta p_{\\phi}^2/2I} dp_{\\phi}) (\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi) = \\frac{1}{nh}(\\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T})(2\\pi)$.\n\nLimit 2: Small-amplitude harmonic torsion ($\\beta V_0 \\to \\infty$).\nThis limit corresponds to low temperature or a high potential barrier, where the molecule is confined to small oscillations within one of the potential wells. We analyze the potential $V(\\phi)$ near a minimum, for example at $\\phi=0$. Using a Taylor expansion for the cosine function, $\\cos(x) \\approx 1 - x^2/2$ for small $x$:\n$$\nV(\\phi) = \\frac{V_0}{2}(1 - \\cos(n\\phi)) \\approx \\frac{V_0}{2}\\left(1 - \\left(1-\\frac{(n\\phi)^2}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{V_0 n^2}{4}\\phi^2\n$$\nThis is a harmonic potential $V(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\text{tors}} \\phi^2$ with a torsional force constant $k_{\\text{tors}} = V_0 n^2 / 2$. The classical partition function for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is $q_{\\text{HO,class}} = k_B T / (h\\nu)$, where $\\nu$ is the oscillation frequency. The frequency is $\\nu = \\omega/(2\\pi) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{k_{\\text{tors}}/I} = \\frac{n}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{V_0/(2I)}$. The expected limiting form is thus:\n$$\nq_{\\text{tors}}(T) \\to q_{\\text{HO,class}} = \\frac{k_B T}{h \\nu} = \\frac{k_B T}{h \\left( \\frac{n}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{V_0}{2I}} \\right)} = \\frac{2\\pi k_B T \\sqrt{2I}}{nh\\sqrt{V_0}}\n$$\nNow we must show that our exact expression for $q_{\\text{tors}}(T)$ reduces to this form. For a large argument $z = \\beta V_0/2 \\to \\infty$, we use the asymptotic expansion for the Bessel function: $I_0(z) \\sim \\exp(z)/\\sqrt{2\\pi z}$.\nSubstituting this into our exact result:\n$$\nq_{\\text{tors}}(T) \\approx \\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}}{nh} \\exp(-z) \\left(\\frac{\\exp(z)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi z}}\\right)\n$$\nThe exponential terms cancel, leaving:\n$$\nq_{\\text{tors}}(T) \\approx \\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}}{nh \\sqrt{2\\pi z}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{nh} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi I k_B T}{2\\pi z}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{nh} \\sqrt{\\frac{I k_B T}{z}}\n$$\nNow, substitute $z = V_0/(2k_B T)$:\n$$\nq_{\\text{tors}}(T) \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{nh} \\sqrt{\\frac{I k_B T}{V_0 / (2k_B T)}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{nh} \\sqrt{\\frac{2I (k_B T)^2}{V_0}} = \\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{nh} \\sqrt{\\frac{2I}{V_0}} = \\frac{2\\pi k_B T \\sqrt{2I}}{nh\\sqrt{V_0}}\n$$\nThis result precisely matches the classical harmonic oscillator partition function $q_{\\text{HO,class}}$ derived above. The asymptotic analysis is therefore successful.\n\nThe final answer is the closed-form expression derived in part (ii).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}}{nh} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_0}{2k_B T}\\right) I_0\\left(\\frac{V_0}{2k_B T}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2817602"}]}
