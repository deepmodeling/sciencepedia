First, we derive a general relation for the energy variance in the canonical ensemble. Second, we apply this result to a classical monatomic ideal gas to find the relative energy fluctuation.\n\n**Part 1: General Derivation of Energy Variance**\n\nIn the canonical ensemble, the probability $P_s$ of finding the system in a microstate $s$ with energy $E_s$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\nP_s = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_s)}{Z(\\beta)}\n$$\nwhere $\\beta \\equiv (k_B T)^{-1}$ and $Z(\\beta)$ is the canonical partition function, defined as the sum over all microstates:\n$$\nZ(\\beta) = \\sum_s \\exp(-\\beta E_s)\n$$\nThe ensemble-averaged internal energy $\\langle E \\rangle$ is given by:\n$$\n\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_s P_s E_s = \\frac{1}{Z(\\beta)} \\sum_s E_s \\exp(-\\beta E_s)\n$$\nWe recognize that the sum $\\sum_s E_s \\exp(-\\beta E_s)$ can be expressed as a derivative of the partition function with respect to $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\sum_s E_s \\exp(-\\beta E_s) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\sum_s \\exp(-\\beta E_s) = -\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial \\beta}\n$$\nThus, the average energy can be written compactly as:\n$$\n\\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\frac{\\partial(\\ln Z)}{\\partial \\beta}\n$$\nNext, we find an expression for the mean square energy, $\\langle E^2 \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle E^2 \\rangle = \\sum_s P_s E_s^2 = \\frac{1}{Z(\\beta)} \\sum_s E_s^2 \\exp(-\\beta E_s)\n$$\nThe sum $\\sum_s E_s^2 \\exp(-\\beta E_s)$ can be related to the second derivative of $Z(\\beta)$:\n$$\n\\sum_s E_s^2 \\exp(-\\beta E_s) = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\beta^2} \\sum_s \\exp(-\\beta E_s) = \\frac{\\partial^2 Z}{\\partial \\beta^2}\n$$\nTherefore, the mean square energy is:\n$$\n\\langle E^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{\\partial^2 Z}{\\partial \\beta^2}\n$$\nThe canonical energy variance, $\\langle (\\Delta E)^2 \\rangle$, is defined as $\\langle E^2 \\rangle - \\langle E \\rangle^2$.

It is therefore deemed **valid**.

Consequently, the sum can be accurately approximated by an integral:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{het}}(T) \\approx \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (2J+1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)\\right) dJ$$\nLet $x = J(J+1)$, so $dx = (2J+1)dJ$. The integral becomes:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{het}}(T) \\approx \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\hbar^2}{2I} x\\right) dx = \\left[ -\\frac{2I}{\\beta \\hbar^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\hbar^2}{2I} x\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\frac{2I}{\\beta \\hbar^2} = \\frac{2Ik_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{\\hbar^2}$$\nThis is the classical partition function for a linear rotor.\n\nFor a homonuclear diatomic molecule, the two nuclei are identical. A rotation by $\\pi$ radians ($180^\\circ$) around an axis perpendicular to the bond produces a configuration that is indistinguishable from the original. To correct for the resulting overcounting of states in the classical limit, we must divide the partition function by the symmetry number, $\\sigma$. For a homonuclear diatomic, $\\sigma = 2$. For a heteronuclear diatomic, $\\sigma = 1$.\n\nTherefore, in the high-temperature limit, the rotational partition function for a homonuclear molecule is:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{hom}}(T) = \\frac{q_{\\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{het}}(T)}{\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2Ik_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{\\hbar^2} = \\frac{Ik_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{\\hbar^2}$$\nNote that a full quantum mechanical treatment involving nuclear spin statistics converges to this same result at high temperatures.\n\nNow, we analyze the consequences for the thermodynamic functions per molecule. We only consider the rotational contributions, as the translational part is identical for both cases. Let $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}$ denote the partition function for one molecule.\nThe total canonical partition function for $N$ molecules is $Q = q^N/N!$, where $q = q_{\\mathrm{trans}}q_{\\mathrm{rot}}$.\n\n1.  **Helmholtz Free Energy ($F$)**: The contribution to the free energy per molecule is $f_{\\mathrm{rot}} = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln q_{\\mathrm{rot}}$.\n    For the homonuclear case:\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{hom}} = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln(q_{\\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{het}}/\\sigma) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T (\\ln q_{\\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{het}} - \\ln \\sigma) = f_{\\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{het}} + k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln \\sigma$$\n    With $\\sigma=2$, the free energy per molecule is **increased by** $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln 2$.\n\n2.  **Entropy ($S$)**: The contribution to the entropy per molecule is $s_{\\mathrm{rot}} = -(\\partial f_{\\mathrm{rot}} / \\partial T)_V$.\n    $$s_{\\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{hom}} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} (f_{\\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{het}} + k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln \\sigma) = s_{\\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{het}} - k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\sigma$$\n    With $\\sigma=2$, the entropy per molecule is **reduced by** $k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln 2$. This is physically logical, as a more symmetric molecule has fewer distinguishable microstates and thus lower entropy.\n\n3.  **Internal Energy ($U$)**: The contribution to the internal energy per molecule is $u_{\\mathrm{rot}} = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T^2 (\\partial \\ln q_{\\mathrm{rot}} / \\partial T)_V$.\n    In the high-temperature limit, $q_{\\mathrm{rot}} = C T$, where $C$ is a constant ($C = 2Ik_{\\mathrm{B}}/\\hbar^2$ for heteronuclear and $Ik_{\\mathrm{B}}/\\hbar^2$ for homonuclear).\n    $$\\ln q_{\\mathrm{rot}} = \\ln C + \\ln T$$\n    $$\\frac{\\partial \\ln q_{\\mathrm{rot}}}{\\partial T} = \\frac{1}{T}$$\n    This derivative is independent of the constant $C$. Therefore:\n    $$u_{\\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{hom}} = u_{\\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{het}} = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$$\n    The internal energy per molecule is **unchanged**. This is consistent with the equipartition theorem, which assigns $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ of energy to the two rotational degrees of freedom.\n\n4.  **Constant-Volume Heat Capacity ($C_V$)**: The contribution to the heat capacity per molecule is $c_{V, \\mathrm{rot}} = (\\partial u_{\\mathrm{rot}} / \\partial T)_V$.\n    Since $u_{\\mathrm{rot}} = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$, we have:\n    $$c_{V, \\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{hom}} = c_{V, \\mathrm{rot}}^{\\mathrm{het}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}$$\n    The heat capacity per molecule is **unchanged**.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. For a homonuclear diatomic, the high-temperature single-molecule rotational partition function equals the heteronuclear result divided by the symmetry number $\\sigma = 2$ due to head–tail indistinguishability of orientations. Consequently, $S$ is reduced by $k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln 2$ per molecule and $F$ is increased by $k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\ln 2$ per molecule, while $U$ and $C_V$ are unchanged in the rigid-rotor regime.**\n    This statement perfectly matches every conclusion of the derivation above.\n    Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. The symmetry number multiplies $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}$ for a homonuclear diatomic because there are $2$ indistinguishable orientations to be counted, increasing $S$ by $k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln 2$ and lowering $F$ by $k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\ln 2$.**\n    Indistinguishability reduces the number of unique states, thus the partition function must be divided, not multiplied, by $\\sigma$. The premise is fundamentally wrong, and the consequences for $S$ and $F$ are reversed.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. The symmetry number divides the rotational level degeneracy $g_J = 2J+1$ by a factor of $2$ for every $J$ in a homonuclear diatomic, which changes the temperature dependence of $U$ and $C_V$ even at high temperature.**\n    This misrepresents the quantum mechanical effect of nuclear symmetry. Symmetry rules do not halve every degeneracy; they selectively eliminate states (e.g., all odd $J$ or all even $J$), depending on nuclear spin. Furthermore, in the high-temperature limit, these details average out, and $U$ and $C_V$ approach classical values that are independent of this fine structure, contrary to the claim.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. There is no effect of head–tail indistinguishability on $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}$ or any thermodynamic function because the degeneracy $g_J = 2J+1$ already accounts for all orientational microstates; therefore introducing $\\sigma$ would double-count a correction.**\n    The degeneracy $g_J = 2J+1$ is due to the spatial quantization of the angular momentum vector and is present for any linear rotor. It does not account for the permutation symmetry of identical nuclei within the molecule. Ignoring this symmetry is a known error that leads to incorrect absolute entropies.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. The symmetry number must be replaced by a temperature-dependent nuclear spin factor, so for a homonuclear diatomic one should divide $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}$ by a $\\sigma(T)$ that varies with $T$ in the high-temperature limit.**\n    While the full quantum-statistical partition function indeed has a structure that deviates from the simple division by $\\sigma$ at low temperatures, the problem explicitly poses the question in the **high-temperature limit**. In this limit, the correction factor correctly asymptotes to the constant value of the symmetry number $\\sigma$. The claim that the effective factor $\\sigma(T)$ varies with $T$ *in the high-temperature limit* is false.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2808863"}]}
