We identify the two functions as the kinetic energy, $T(p) = \\frac{p^{2}}{2m}$, and the potential energy, $V(q) = \\alpha q^{3}$. Let us denote $A(q, p) = T(p) = \\frac{p^{2}}{2m}$ and $B(q, p) = V(q) = \\alpha q^{3}$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the necessary partial derivatives of $A$ and $B$ with respect to $q$ and $p$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} \\left(\\frac{p^{2}}{2m}\\right) = 0$, since the kinetic energy term does not explicitly depend on the coordinate $q$.\n    \\item $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left(\\frac{p^{2}}{2m}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2m} (2p) = \\frac{p}{m}$.\n    \\item $\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} (\\alpha q^{3}) = 3\\alpha q^{2}$.\n    \\item $\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} (\\alpha q^{3}) = 0$, since the potential energy term does not depend on the momentum $p$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nNow, we substitute these partial derivatives into the definition of the Poisson bracket:\n$$\n\\left\\{\\frac{p^{2}}{2m}, V(q)\\right\\} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\frac{p^{2}}{2m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\partial V(q)}{\\partial p}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\frac{p^{2}}{2m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\partial V(q)}{\\partial q}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\left\\{\\frac{p^{2}}{2m}, V(q)\\right\\} = (0)(0) - \\left(\\frac{p}{m}\\right) \\left(3\\alpha q^{2}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression, we obtain the result for the Poisson bracket:\n$$\n\\left\\{\\frac{p^{2}}{2m}, V(q)\\right\\} = -\\frac{3\\alpha p q^{2}}{m}\n$$\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this result in the context of Hamilton's equations of motion. Hamilton's equations are:\n$$\n\\dot{q} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{p} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}\n$$\nFor the given Hamiltonian $H = \\frac{p^{2}}{2m} + V(q)$, these equations yield:\n$$\n\\dot{q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\left(\\frac{p^{2}}{2m} + V(q)\\right) = \\frac{p}{m}\n$$\nThis equation identifies the quantity $\\frac{p}{m}$ as the velocity of the particle. The second equation gives the time evolution of the momentum:\n$$\n\\dot{p} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\left(\\frac{p^{2}}{2m} + V(q)\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial V(q)}{\\partial q}\n$$\nIn classical mechanics, the force $F$ is defined as the negative gradient of the potential energy. In our one-dimensional case, this is $F = -\\frac{dV}{dq}$. Therefore, Hamilton's second equation is a statement of Newton's second law, $\\dot{p} = F$. For the specified potential $V(q) = \\alpha q^{3}$, the force is:\n$$\nF = -\\frac{d}{dq}(\\alpha q^{3}) = -3\\alpha q^{2}\n$$\nLet us now examine the computed Poisson bracket result, $-\\frac{3\\alpha p q^{2}}{m}$. We can rewrite this expression by rearranging the terms:\n$$\n-\\frac{3\\alpha p q^{2}}{m} = \\left(\\frac{p}{m}\\right) (-3\\alpha q^{2})\n$$\nWe have already identified $\\frac{p}{m}$ as the velocity $\\dot{q}$ and $-3\\alpha q^{2}$ as the force $F$. Thus, the Poisson bracket is equal to the product of velocity and force:\n$$\n\\left\\{\\frac{p^{2}}{2m}, V(q)\\right\\} = \\dot{q} F\n$$\nThe product of force and velocity is power ($P$), which is the rate at which the force does work on the particle. This result has a deep connection to the time evolution of energy. The time evolution of any time-independent observable $G$ is given by $\\frac{dG}{dt} = \\{G, H\\}$. For the kinetic energy $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$, its rate of change is:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\{T, H\\} = \\left\\{\\frac{p^2}{2m}, \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(q)\\right\\} = \\left\\{\\frac{p^2}{2m}, \\frac{p^2}{2m}\\right\\} + \\left\\{\\frac{p^2}{2m}, V(q)\\right\\}\n$$\nSince any bracket of a function with itself is zero, $\\{A, A\\} = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\left\\{\\frac{p^{2}}{2m}, V(q)\\right\\}\n$$\nTherefore, our calculated Poisson bracket, $\\left\\{\\frac{p^{2}}{2m}, V(q)\\right\\} = \\dot{q}F = P$, is precisely the time rate of change of the kinetic energy, which is consistent with the work-energy theorem.
