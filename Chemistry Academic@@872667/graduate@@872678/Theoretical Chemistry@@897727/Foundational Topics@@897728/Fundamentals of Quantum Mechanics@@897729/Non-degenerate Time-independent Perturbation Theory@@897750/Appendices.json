Express your final answer as an exact value in Joules. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard exercise in quantum mechanics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the first-order correction to the energy, $E_{n}^{(1)}$, for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well subjected to a linear perturbation. The derivation must start from fundamental principles and use symmetry arguments.\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for the perturbed system is:\n$$ (H^{(0)} + W) \\psi_{n} = E_{n} \\psi_{n} $$\nwhere $H^{(0)}$ is the unperturbed Hamiltonian, $W$ is the perturbation, $E_{n}$ is the exact energy eigenvalue, and $\\psi_{n}$ is the corresponding exact eigenfunction.\n\nIn non-degenerate time-independent perturbation theory, we expand the energy eigenvalue and eigenfunction as power series:\n$$ E_{n} = E_{n}^{(0)} + E_{n}^{(1)} + E_{n}^{(2)} + \\dots $$\n$$ \\psi_{n} = \\psi_{n}^{(0)} + \\psi_{n}^{(1)} + \\psi_{n}^{(2)} + \\dots $$\nHere, $E_{n}^{(0)}$ and $\\psi_{n}^{(0)}$ are the eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, satisfying $H^{(0)}\\psi_{n}^{(0)} = E_{n}^{(0)}\\psi_{n}^{(0)}$.\n\nSubstituting these expansions into the perturbed Schrödinger equation gives:\n$$ (H^{(0)} + W) (\\psi_{n}^{(0)} + \\psi_{n}^{(1)} + \\dots) = (E_{n}^{(0)} + E_{n}^{(1)} + \\dots) (\\psi_{n}^{(0)} + \\psi_{n}^{(1)} + \\dots) $$\nExpanding this equation and collecting terms of the first order yields:\n$$ H^{(0)}\\psi_{n}^{(1)} + W\\psi_{n}^{(0)} = E_{n}^{(0)}\\psi_{n}^{(1)} + E_{n}^{(1)}\\psi_{n}^{(0)} $$\nTo find the first-order energy correction, $E_{n}^{(1)}$, we take the inner product of this equation with the unperturbed state $\\psi_{n}^{(0)}$. In Dirac notation, this is written as projecting onto $\\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} |$:\n$$ \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | H^{(0)}\\psi_{n}^{(1)} \\rangle + \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | W|\\psi_{n}^{(0)} \\rangle = \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | E_{n}^{(0)}\\psi_{n}^{(1)} \\rangle + \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | E_{n}^{(1)}\\psi_{n}^{(0)} \\rangle $$\nThe Hamiltonian $H^{(0)}$ is a Hermitian operator. Therefore, we can act with it on the bra-vector:\n$$ \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | H^{(0)}\\psi_{n}^{(1)} \\rangle = \\langle H^{(0)}\\psi_{n}^{(0)} | \\psi_{n}^{(1)} \\rangle = \\langle E_{n}^{(0)}\\psi_{n}^{(0)} | \\psi_{n}^{(1)} \\rangle = E_{n}^{(0)*} \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | \\psi_{n}^{(1)} \\rangle $$\nSince the unperturbed energies $E_{n}^{(0)}$ are real, $E_{n}^{(0)*} = E_{n}^{(0)}$. The scalars $E_{n}^{(0)}$ and $E_{n}^{(1)}$ can be factored out of the inner products. The unperturbed stationary states are normalized, so $\\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | \\psi_{n}^{(0)} \\rangle = 1$. The equation becomes:\n$$ E_{n}^{(0)} \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | \\psi_{n}^{(1)} \\rangle + \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | W|\\psi_{n}^{(0)} \\rangle = E_{n}^{(0)} \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | \\psi_{n}^{(1)} \\rangle + E_{n}^{(1)} \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | \\psi_{n}^{(0)} \\rangle $$\n$$ E_{n}^{(0)} \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | \\psi_{n}^{(1)} \\rangle + \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | W|\\psi_{n}^{(0)} \\rangle = E_{n}^{(0)} \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | \\psi_{n}^{(1)} \\rangle + E_{n}^{(1)} $$\nThe term $E_{n}^{(0)} \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | \\psi_{n}^{(1)} \\rangle$ cancels from both sides, leaving the well-known formula for the first-order energy correction:\n$$ E_{n}^{(1)} = \\langle \\psi_{n}^{(0)} | W | \\psi_{n}^{(0)} \\rangle $$\nIn position representation, this is the integral:\n$$ E_{n}^{(1)} = \\int_{-a}^{a} \\psi_{n}^{(0)*}(x) W(x) \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x) \\,dx $$\nThe problem now reduces to evaluating this integral. We are instructed to use symmetry properties.\n\nThe unperturbed potential is an infinite well symmetric about the origin, $x=0$. The unperturbed Hamiltonian, $H^{(0)} = -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}$ with boundary conditions $\\psi(\\pm a) = 0$, is invariant under the parity transformation $x \\rightarrow -x$. Let $P$ be the parity operator, defined by $P f(x) = f(-x)$. The invariance means that the Hamiltonian commutes with the parity operator, $[H^{(0)}, P] = 0$.\n\nSince the energy levels of the one-dimensional infinite square well are non-degenerate, the stationary states $\\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x)$ must also be eigenstates of the parity operator $P$. This means they must have definite parity; they are either even functions or odd functions.\n$$ P\\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x) = \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(-x) = p \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x) $$\nwhere the parity eigenvalue $p$ can be $+1$ (even) or $-1$ (odd).\n\nThe wavefunctions are real, so $\\psi_{n}^{(0)*}(x) = \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x)$. The expression for the energy correction is:\n$$ E_{n}^{(1)} = \\int_{-a}^{a} \\left[ \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x) \\right]^{2} W(x) \\,dx $$\nLet us analyze the parity of the integrand, $I(x) = \\left[ \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x) \\right]^{2} W(x)$.\nThe term $\\left[ \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x) \\right]^{2}$ has the following parity:\n$$ \\left[ \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(-x) \\right]^{2} = \\left[ p \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x) \\right]^{2} = p^{2} \\left[ \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x) \\right]^{2} = (+1) \\left[ \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x) \\right]^{2} $$\nThus, $\\left[ \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x) \\right]^{2}$ is always an even function, regardless of the parity of $\\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x)$.\n\nThe perturbation is given by $W(x) = Fx$. Its parity is:\n$$ W(-x) = F(-x) = -Fx = -W(x) $$\nThe perturbation $W(x)$ is an odd function.\n\nThe integrand $I(x)$ is the product of an even function, $\\left[ \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x) \\right]^{2}$, and an odd function, $W(x)$. The product of an even and an odd function is an odd function:\n$$ I(-x) = \\left[ \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(-x) \\right]^{2} W(-x) = \\left( \\left[ \\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x) \\right]^{2} \\right) \\left( -W(x) \\right) = -I(x) $$\nThe integral of any odd function over a symmetric interval, such as $[-a, a]$, is identically zero.\n$$ E_{n}^{(1)} = \\int_{-a}^{a} I(x) \\,dx = 0 $$\nThis result holds for any stationary state $\\psi_{n}^{(0)}(x)$ of the symmetric infinite potential well. The first-order correction to the energy is zero, independent of the quantum number $n$, the mass $m$, the size of the well $a$, or the strength of the perturbation $F$.

This is most systematically accomplished using the ladder operator formalism. The position operator $x$ is expressed in terms of the lowering (annihilation) operator $a$ and the raising (creation) operator $a^{\\dagger}$:\n$$x = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}} (a + a^{\\dagger})$$\nThese operators act on the unperturbed number states $|n\\rangle$ as follows:\n$$a|n\\rangle = \\sqrt{n}|n-1\\rangle \\quad (n \\ge 1); \\quad a|0\\rangle = 0$$\n$$a^{\\dagger}|n\\rangle = \\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\\rangle$$\nThe number states form an orthonormal basis, $\\langle m | n \\rangle = \\delta_{mn}$.\n\nTo evaluate $\\langle n | x^{4} | n \\rangle$, we can write $x^{4} = x^{2} x^{2}$ and insert a complete set of states, $\\hat{I} = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} |m\\rangle\\langle m|$, between the two $x^{2}$ operators.
