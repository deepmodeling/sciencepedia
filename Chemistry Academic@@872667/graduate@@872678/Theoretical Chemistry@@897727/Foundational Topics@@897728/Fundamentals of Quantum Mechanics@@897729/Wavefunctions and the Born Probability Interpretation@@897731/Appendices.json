It presents a standard, solvable problem in quantum mechanics without any apparent flaws. Therefore, we proceed with a rigorous derivation of the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the normalization constant $N$ for the given isotropic Gaussian-type orbital $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = N \\exp(-\\alpha r^{2})$. According to the Born probability interpretation, the quantity $|\\phi(\\mathbf{r})|^{2}$ represents the probability density for the position of the electron. The condition for normalization states that the integral of this probability density over all of three-dimensional space must be equal to $1$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} |\\phi(\\mathbf{r})|^2 dV = 1 $$\nThe given wavefunction is a real-valued function, assuming $N$ is a real constant. Thus, $|\\phi(\\mathbf{r})|^2 = \\phi(\\mathbf{r})^2$. The normalization condition becomes:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\left( N \\exp(-\\alpha r^2) \\right)^2 dV = 1 $$\n$$ N^2 \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\exp(-2\\alpha r^2) dV = 1 $$\nThe integrand $\\exp(-2\\alpha r^2)$ possesses spherical symmetry, as it depends only on the radial distance $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$. It is therefore highly advantageous to perform the integration in spherical coordinates. The differential volume element $dV$ in spherical coordinates is given by $dV = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$, where the integration limits are $r \\in [0, \\infty)$, $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, and $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nSubstituting the volume element into the normalization integral, we obtain:\n$$ N^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-2\\alpha r^2) r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi = 1 $$\nThe integrand is independent of the angles $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. This allows for the separation of the integral into a product of three one-dimensional integrals:\n$$ N^2 \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\right) \\left( \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_0^\\infty r^2 \\exp(-2\\alpha r^2) \\, dr \\right) = 1 $$\nThe angular integrals are standard and evaluate as follows:\n$$ \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi = [\\phi]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi $$\n$$ \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta = [-\\cos\\theta]_0^\\pi = (-\\cos\\pi) - (-\\cos 0) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2 $$\nThe product of the angular integrals yields the total solid angle of a sphere, which is $4\\pi$. The normalization equation thus simplifies to:\n$$ 4\\pi N^2 \\int_0^\\infty r^2 \\exp(-2\\alpha r^2) \\, dr = 1 $$\nWe must now evaluate the remaining radial integral, which we denote as $I_r$:\n$$ I_r = \\int_0^\\infty r^2 \\exp(-2\\alpha r^2) \\, dr $$\nThis is a standard form of a Gaussian integral. It can be solved using several methods, including differentiation with respect to a parameter or by relating it to the Gamma function. We use the latter approach, which is most direct. The general formula for this type of integral is given by:\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty x^m \\exp(-ax^2) \\, dx = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{m+1}{2}\\right)}{2a^{(m+1)/2}} $$\nIn our integral $I_r$, we have $m=2$ and the parameter $a = 2\\alpha$. Applying the formula:\n$$ I_r = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{2+1}{2}\\right)}{2(2\\alpha)^{(2+1)/2}} = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)}{2(2\\alpha)^{3/2}} $$\nThe Gamma function $\\Gamma(z)$ satisfies the recurrence relation $\\Gamma(z+1) = z\\Gamma(z)$. A key value is $\\Gamma(1/2) = \\sqrt{\\pi}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $I_r$:\n$$ I_r = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}}{2(2\\alpha)^{3/2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4(2\\alpha)^{3/2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4 \\cdot 2^{3/2} \\alpha^{3/2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{8\\sqrt{2}\\alpha^{3/2}} $$\nNow, we substitute the value of the integral $I_r$ back into the normalization equation:\n$$ 4\\pi N^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{8\\sqrt{2}\\alpha^{3/2}} \\right) = 1 $$\nWe solve for $N^2$:\n$$ N^2 \\frac{4\\pi \\sqrt{\\pi}}{8\\sqrt{2}\\alpha^{3/2}} = 1 $$\n$$ N^2 \\frac{\\pi^{3/2}}{2\\sqrt{2}\\alpha^{3/2}} = 1 $$\nThis expression can be rewritten as:\n$$ N^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2\\alpha} \\right)^{3/2} = 1 $$\nSolving for $N^2$:\n$$ N^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2\\alpha} \\right)^{-3/2} = \\left( \\frac{2\\alpha}{\\pi} \\right)^{3/2} $$\nBy convention, the normalization constant $N$ for a real wavefunction is taken to be real and positive. Taking the square root of both sides gives the final expression for $N$:\n$$ N = \\left[ \\left( \\frac{2\\alpha}{\\pi} \\right)^{3/2} \\right]^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{2\\alpha}{\\pi} \\right)^{3/4} $$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the normalization constant in terms of the parameter $\\alpha$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\pi}\\right)^{3/4}}$$", "id": "2829832"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the properties of a single quantum state, the relationships between different states are crucial for understanding dynamics and spectroscopy.
