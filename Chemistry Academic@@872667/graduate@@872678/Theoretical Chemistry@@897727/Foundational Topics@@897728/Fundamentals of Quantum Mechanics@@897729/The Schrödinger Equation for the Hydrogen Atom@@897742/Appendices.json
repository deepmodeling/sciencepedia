It presents a standard, solvable problem in quantum mechanics without any factual inconsistencies, ambiguities, or missing information. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the application of the Hellmann–Feynman theorem. This theorem provides a method for calculating the derivative of an energy eigenvalue with respect to a parameter in the Hamiltonian. For a Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}(\\lambda)$ that depends on a continuous parameter $\\lambda$, and for a normalized eigenstate $\\lvert \\psi_n(\\lambda)\\rangle$ such that $\\hat{H}(\\lambda)\\lvert \\psi_n(\\lambda)\\rangle = E_n(\\lambda)\\lvert \\psi_n(\\lambda)\\rangle$, the theorem states:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_n}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\left\\langle \\psi_n(\\lambda) \\left| \\frac{\\partial \\hat{H}(\\lambda)}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right| \\psi_n(\\lambda) \\right\\rangle\n$$\nIn the present problem, the parameter $\\lambda$ is the reduced mass $\\mu$. The Hamiltonian is given as:\n$$\n\\hat{H}(\\mu) = \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}^{2}}{2\\mu} - \\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}r}\n$$\nWe first compute the partial derivative of the Hamiltonian operator with respect to $\\mu$. The potential energy term is independent of $\\mu$, so the derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{H}}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mu} \\left( \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}^{2}}{2\\mu} \\right) = -\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}^{2}}{2\\mu^2}\n$$\nApplying the Hellmann–Feynman theorem with the eigenstates $\\lvert n,\\ell,m\\rangle$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_n}{\\partial \\mu} = \\left\\langle n,\\ell,m \\left| -\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}^{2}}{2\\mu^2} \\right| n,\\ell,m \\right\\rangle = -\\frac{1}{\\mu^2} \\left\\langle n,\\ell,m \\left| \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}^{2}}{2} \\right| n,\\ell,m \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe expectation value is taken over the eigenstate corresponding to the energy $E_n$. The term $\\hat{T} = \\hat{\\mathbf{p}}^2/(2\\mu)$ is the kinetic energy operator. Therefore, we can write the expectation value of $\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}^2/2$ in terms of the expectation value of the kinetic energy, $\\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle_n$:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}^{2}}{2} \\right\\rangle_n = \\mu \\left\\langle \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}^{2}}{2\\mu} \\right\\rangle_n = \\mu \\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle_n\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the derivative gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_n}{\\partial \\mu} = -\\frac{1}{\\mu^2} (\\mu \\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle_n) = -\\frac{\\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle_n}{\\mu}\n$$\nTo evaluate this expression fully, we must find a closed-form expression for $\\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle_n$. This is achieved by invoking the quantum mechanical virial theorem. For a system in a stationary state with a potential of the form $V(r) = A r^k$, the virial theorem establishes the relationship $2\\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle = k\\langle \\hat{V} \\rangle$. The Coulomb potential for the hydrogen atom, $\\hat{V}(r) = -e^2/(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r)$, corresponds to the case $k=-1$. Thus, for any eigenstate $\\lvert n,\\ell,m\\rangle$:\n$$\n2\\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle_n = -\\langle \\hat{V} \\rangle_n\n$$\nThe total energy $E_n$ is the sum of the expectation values of the kinetic and potential energies:\n$$\nE_n = \\langle \\hat{H} \\rangle_n = \\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle_n + \\langle \\hat{V} \\rangle_n\n$$\nUsing the virial theorem result $\\langle \\hat{V} \\rangle_n = -2\\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle_n$, we can express $E_n$ solely in terms of the kinetic energy expectation value:\n$$\nE_n = \\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle_n + (-2\\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle_n) = -\\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle_n\n$$\nThis fundamental result shows that for a Coulomb potential, the expectation value of the kinetic energy is the negative of the total energy of the stationary state. Now, we substitute $\\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle_n = -E_n$ into our expression for the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_n}{\\partial \\mu} = -\\frac{(-E_n)}{\\mu} = \\frac{E_n}{\\mu}\n$$\nThis is a correct intermediate result. However, the problem requires the final expression to be in terms of the principal quantum number $n$ and fundamental constants $e$, $\\hbar$, and $\\epsilon_0$. To achieve this, we must use the known formula for the energy eigenvalues of the nonrelativistic hydrogenic atom:\n$$\nE_n = -\\frac{\\mu e^4}{2(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 \\hbar^2 n^2} = -\\frac{\\mu e^4}{32 \\pi^2 \\epsilon_0^2 \\hbar^2 n^2}\n$$\nNote that $E_n$ is directly proportional to the reduced mass $\\mu$. Substituting this expression for $E_n$ into our result $\\partial E_n/\\partial \\mu = E_n/\\mu$ gives the final answer:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_n}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left( -\\frac{\\mu e^4}{32 \\pi^2 \\epsilon_0^2 \\hbar^2 n^2} \\right) = -\\frac{e^4}{32 \\pi^2 \\epsilon_0^2 \\hbar^2 n^2}\n$$\nThis result can be verified by directly differentiating the expression for $E_n$ with respect to $\\mu$, which confirms the consistency of our approach.\n\nFinally, we are asked to explain the physical meaning of the sign and scaling of this result.\nThe sign of $\\partial E_n/\\partial \\mu$ is negative. This implies that as the reduced mass $\\mu$ increases, the energy eigenvalue $E_n$ decreases (becomes more negative). A more negative energy corresponds to a more tightly bound system. The ionization energy, given by $|E_n|$, increases with $\\mu$. In the context of isotopic substitution, consider protium (nucleus is a proton, $m_p$) and deuterium (nucleus is a deuteron, $m_d$). The reduced mass is given by $\\mu = m_e m_{nuc} / (m_e + m_{nuc})$. Since $m_d \\approx 2m_p$, the reduced mass of the deuterium atom, $\\mu_D$, is slightly larger than that of the protium atom, $\\mu_P$. Consequently, $E_n(\\text{deuterium})  E_n(\\text{protium})$. This phenomenon is known as the isotope shift, and it leads to a small shift in the spectral lines of deuterium to higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) compared to protium, because the energy differences between levels are slightly larger.\n\nThe scaling of the result is with $1/n^2$. The magnitude of the derivative, $|\\partial E_n/\\partial\\mu|$, is proportional to $1/n^2$. This indicates that the sensitivity of the energy levels to a change in reduced mass is greatest for the lowest energy state (the ground state, $n=1$) and decreases rapidly for higher excited states. Therefore, the absolute energy shift due to isotopic substitution is most significant for the ground state and for transitions involving states with small values of $n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{e^{4}}{32\\pi^{2}\\epsilon_{0}^{2}\\hbar^{2}n^{2}}}$$", "id": "2821945"}, {"introduction": "The interaction of atoms with light, which drives spectroscopy, is governed by strict selection rules that dictate which transitions between quantum states are allowed.
