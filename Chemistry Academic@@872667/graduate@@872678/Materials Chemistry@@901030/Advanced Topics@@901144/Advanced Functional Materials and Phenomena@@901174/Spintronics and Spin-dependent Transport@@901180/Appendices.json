In the two-current model, the total electron population is divided into two independent groups: spin-up ($\\uparrow$) and spin-down ($\\downarrow$).

Ohm's law states that the current density $\\vec{j}$ is proportional to the electric field $\\vec{E}$, with the conductivity $\\sigma$ as the constant of proportionality: $\\vec{j} = \\sigma \\vec{E}$. Since the electric field is uniform and applied along the sample, we can work with the magnitudes $j$ and $E$.

In ferromagnets, the coupling to a given spin channel scales with the spin polarization as $\\Gamma_{L\\sigma}=\\Gamma_0(1+\\sigma P_L)$ and $\\Gamma_{R\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{P})}=\\Gamma_0(1+\\sigma P_R)$ for the parallel configuration. For antiparallel alignment, the right electrode’s spin quantization is reversed relative to the left, giving $\\Gamma_{R\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{AP})}=\\Gamma_0(1-\\sigma P_R)$. Evaluated at the Fermi energy $E_F=0$, we define $\\Delta E=E_F-E_0$ and obtain\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{res},\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}(E_F) = \\frac{\\Gamma_{L\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}\\Gamma_{R\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}}{\\Delta E^2 + \\left(\\Gamma_{\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}/2\\right)^2}.\n$$\n\nIf many vacancy states are present but sufficiently dilute and noninteracting, their contributions add linearly. We represent their areal density by $\\rho_v$ and approximate the total resonant contribution as $\\rho_v$ times the single-state transmission at $E_F$:\n$$\nT_{\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})} = T_{\\mathrm{bg},\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})} + \\rho_v\\,T_{\\mathrm{res},\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}.\n$$\n\nFrom these spin-resolved transmissions, we construct observables of interest:\n\n- The current spin polarization in the parallel configuration,\n$$\nP_I = \\frac{T_{\\uparrow}^{(\\mathrm{P})} - T_{\\downarrow}^{(\\mathrm{P})}}{T_{\\uparrow}^{(\\mathrm{P})} + T_{\\downarrow}^{(\\mathrm{P})}},\n$$\nwith $T_{\\uparrow}^{(\\mathrm{P})}=T_{+1}^{(\\mathrm{P})}$ and $T_{\\downarrow}^{(\\mathrm{P})}=T_{-1}^{(\\mathrm{P})}$.\n\n- The Tunneling Magnetoresistance (TMR),\n$$\n\\mathrm{TMR} = \\frac{T^{(\\mathrm{P})} - T^{(\\mathrm{AP})}}{T^{(\\mathrm{AP})}},\\quad \\text{where}\\quad T^{(\\mathrm{conf})}=\\sum_{\\sigma\\in\\{+1,-1\\}}T_{\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}.\n$$\n\nAlgorithmic procedure for each parameter set $(P_L, P_R, T_0, \\Gamma_0, \\gamma_{\\mathrm{nr}}, \\Delta E, \\rho_v)$:\n\n1. For each spin $\\sigma\\in\\{+1,-1\\}$ and configuration $\\mathrm{conf}\\in\\{\\mathrm{P},\\mathrm{AP}\\}$, compute the background transmission $T_{\\mathrm{bg},\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}$ using the expressions above.\n2. Compute the couplings $\\Gamma_{L\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}$ and $\\Gamma_{R\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}$, then the total width $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}=\\Gamma_{L\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}+\\Gamma_{R\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}+\\gamma_{\\mathrm{nr}}$.\n3. Evaluate the resonant transmission $T_{\\mathrm{res},\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}(E_F)$ at $E_F=0$ via the Breit–Wigner form with $\\Delta E$.\n4. Form the total spin-resolved transmissions $T_{\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}=T_{\\mathrm{bg},\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}+\\rho_v\\,T_{\\mathrm{res},\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{conf})}$.\n5. Compute $P_I$ from the parallel spin-resolved transmissions and $\\mathrm{TMR}$ from the configuration-summed transmissions.\n6. Output $[P_I,\\mathrm{TMR}]$ rounded to six decimals.\n\nScientific interpretation across the test suite:\n\n- Case $1$ has $\\rho_v=0$, so only the direct background contributes. The spin polarization and $\\mathrm{TMR}$ reduce to the standard direct-tunneling limit governed by $P_L$ and $P_R$.\n- Cases $2$ and $3$ are on resonance ($\\Delta E=0$) and show how resonant channels with spin-dependent couplings modify both $P_I$ and $\\mathrm{TMR}$. Increasing $\\rho_v$ scales both spin channels similarly at exact resonance, so $P_I$ and $\\mathrm{TMR}$ can become nearly independent of $\\rho_v$ when resonance dominates, while their absolute transmissions grow.\n- Case $4$ is off-resonance ($\\Delta E$ large compared to widths), suppressing the resonant contribution; observables revert toward the background-tunneling values.\n- Case $5$ sets $P_L=P_R=0$, making all channels spin-symmetric so that $P_I=0$ and $\\mathrm{TMR}=0$ regardless of $\\rho_v$ and $\\Delta E$.\n\nNumerical stability is ensured by the inclusion of $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{nr}} > 0$, which prevents divergence at $\\Delta E=0$ even if couplings are small. The final program implements the steps above and prints a single line containing the list of $[P_I,\\mathrm{TMR}]$ pairs for the five cases, each rounded to six decimal places and dimensionless.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_background_Tsigma(sigma, PL, PR, T0, config):\n    \"\"\"\n    Background (direct barrier) spin-resolved transmission.\n    config: 'P' or 'AP'\n    \"\"\"\n    if config == 'P':\n        factor_R = (1.0 + sigma * PR)\n    elif config == 'AP':\n        factor_R = (1.0 - sigma * PR)\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"config must be 'P' or 'AP'\")\n    factor_L = (1.0 + sigma * PL)\n    return T0 * factor_L * factor_R\n\ndef compute_resonant_Tsigma(sigma, PL, PR, Gamma0, gamma_nr, dE, config):\n    \"\"\"\n    Resonant (Breit-Wigner) spin-resolved transmission at EF (E=0).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Spin-dependent couplings to electrodes\n    Gamma_L = Gamma0 * (1.0 + sigma * PL)\n    if config == 'P':\n        Gamma_R = Gamma0 * (1.0 + sigma * PR)\n    elif config == 'AP':\n        Gamma_R = Gamma0 * (1.0 - sigma * PR)\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"config must be 'P' or 'AP'\")\n    Gamma_tot = Gamma_L + Gamma_R + gamma_nr\n    denom = dE**2 + (Gamma_tot * 0.5)**2\n    # Avoid any numerical issue if denom is extremely small (shouldn't happen with gamma_nr0)\n    if denom = 0.0:\n        return 0.0\n    return (Gamma_L * Gamma_R) / denom\n\ndef compute_observables(PL, PR, T0, Gamma0, gamma_nr, dE, rho_v):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute (P_I, TMR) for given parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parallel configuration spin-resolved transmissions\n    T_up_P_bg = compute_background_Tsigma(+1.0, PL, PR, T0, 'P')\n    T_dn_P_bg = compute_background_Tsigma(-1.0, PL, PR, T0, 'P')\n    T_up_P_res = compute_resonant_Tsigma(+1.0, PL, PR, Gamma0, gamma_nr, dE, 'P')\n    T_dn_P_res = compute_resonant_Tsigma(-1.0, PL, PR, Gamma0, gamma_nr, dE, 'P')\n    T_up_P = T_up_P_bg + rho_v * T_up_P_res\n    T_dn_P = T_dn_P_bg + rho_v * T_dn_P_res\n\n    # Antiparallel configuration total transmission\n    T_up_AP_bg = compute_background_Tsigma(+1.0, PL, PR, T0, 'AP')\n    T_dn_AP_bg = compute_background_Tsigma(-1.0, PL, PR, T0, 'AP')\n    T_up_AP_res = compute_resonant_Tsigma(+1.0, PL, PR, Gamma0, gamma_nr, dE, 'AP')\n    T_dn_AP_res = compute_resonant_Tsigma(-1.0, PL, PR, Gamma0, gamma_nr, dE, 'AP')\n    T_up_AP = T_up_AP_bg + rho_v * T_up_AP_res\n    T_dn_AP = T_dn_AP_bg + rho_v * T_dn_AP_res\n\n    # Current spin polarization in P configuration\n    denom_P = T_up_P + T_dn_P\n    # Guard against divide by zero (should not occur with T0  0 or rho_v  0)\n    if denom_P == 0.0:\n        P_I = 0.0\n    else:\n        P_I = (T_up_P - T_dn_P) / denom_P\n\n    # TMR\n    T_P_total = T_up_P + T_dn_P\n    T_AP_total = T_up_AP + T_dn_AP\n    if T_AP_total == 0.0:\n        TMR = 0.0\n    else:\n        TMR = (T_P_total - T_AP_total) / T_AP_total\n\n    return P_I, TMR\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each is (PL, PR, T0, Gamma0, gamma_nr, dE, rho_v)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.4, 0.5, 1.0e-4, 0.02, 0.005, 0.05, 0.0),  # Case 1\n        (0.4, 0.5, 1.0e-4, 0.02, 0.005, 0.0, 0.5),   # Case 2\n        (0.4, 0.5, 1.0e-4, 0.02, 0.005, 0.0, 3.0),   # Case 3\n        (0.4, 0.5, 1.0e-4, 0.02, 0.005, 0.2, 3.0),   # Case 4\n        (0.0, 0.0, 1.0e-4, 0.02, 0.005, 0.0, 3.0),   # Case 5\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        PL, PR, T0, Gamma0, gamma_nr, dE, rho_v = case\n        p_i, tmr = compute_observables(PL, PR, T0, Gamma0, gamma_nr, dE, rho_v)\n        # Round to six decimals as required\n        p_i_rounded = float(f\"{p_i:.6f}\")\n        tmr_rounded = float(f\"{tmr:.6f}\")\n        results.append([p_i_rounded, tmr_rounded])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # \"[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...[xN,yN]]\" with floats rounded to six decimals.\n    def format_list_of_pairs(pairs):\n        inner = \",\".join([f\"[{pair[0]:.6f},{pair[1]:.6f}]\" for pair in pairs])\n        return f\"[{inner}]\"\n\n    print(format_list_of_pairs(results))\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2525185"}]}
