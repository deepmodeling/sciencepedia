Validation**\nThe provided givens and observations are scientifically sound and internally consistent. They describe canonical behaviors observed in relaxor ferroelectrics that also exhibit extrinsic conductivity and interfacial effects. The described techniques (dielectric and modulus spectroscopy) and the tests performed (varying thickness, changing electrodes) are standard methods for deconvolving bulk and interfacial phenomena. The problem is well-posed, objective, and grounded in the established physics of dielectrics. It is a valid problem in materials science.\n\n**3. Solution Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nWe must distinguish between two phenomena:\n1.  **Intrinsic Relaxor Dynamics:** The frequency-dependent freezing of polar nanoregions (PNRs). This is a bulk property, independent of sample geometry or contacts. Its characteristic frequency, $f(T_{m})$, typically follows the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) relation: $f = f_0 \\exp[-E_a / (k_B(T_{m} - T_{f}))]$, where $T_f$ is a finite static freezing temperature. This relationship linearizes a plot of $\\ln f$ versus $1/(T_m - T_f)$.\n2.  **Maxwell–Wagner (MW) Interfacial Polarization:** This arises from charge accumulation at electrical inhomogeneities, such as grain boundaries or sample-electrode interfaces. It is an extrinsic effect. The relaxation frequency is typically determined by charge transport (conductivity) and thus follows an Arrhenius law: $f_p = f_0 \\exp[-E_a / (k_B T)]$. The activation energy $E_a$ is related to that of the DC conductivity. MW effects are sensitive to sample geometry and the nature of the interfaces (e.g., electrodes). The imaginary part of the electric modulus, $M'' = \\varepsilon'' / (\\varepsilon'^2 + \\varepsilon''^2)$, is particularly effective at separating bulk relaxations from interfacial effects, as it suppresses signals from high-capacitance/high-loss layers.\n\nWe now evaluate each statement based on these principles.\n\n**A. A finite freezing temperature inferred from a linear dependence of $\\ln f$ on $1/(T_{m}-T_{f})$ for some $T_{f}0$ indicates intrinsic relaxor dynamics rather than interfacial Maxwell–Wagner polarization.**\nThe problem states that a plot of $\\ln f$ versus $1/(T_{m}-220\\,\\mathrm{K})$ is linear, which is a direct manifestation of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann law with a freezing temperature $T_f = 220\\,\\mathrm{K}$. This VFT behavior is the signature of a cooperative, glass-like freezing of dipolar entities, which is the defining characteristic of intrinsic relaxor ferroelectric dynamics. In contrast, a simple thermally activated process like MW polarization follows an Arrhenius law, leading to a linear plot of $\\ln f$ versus $1/T$. The non-Arrhenius behavior described by the VFT law is a key differentiator.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A low-frequency regime with $\\tan\\delta\\sim 1/\\omega$ and an apparent $\\varepsilon'$ that scales upward with sample thickness $t$ is characteristic of Maxwell–Wagner interfacial polarization rather than intrinsic relaxor behavior.**\nThe loss tangent is defined as $\\tan\\delta = \\varepsilon''/\\varepsilon'$. At low frequencies, the imaginary permittivity is often dominated by DC conductivity, $\\sigma_{dc}$, such that $\\varepsilon''(\\omega) \\approx \\sigma_{dc}/(\\omega \\varepsilon_0)$. This leads to $\\tan\\delta \\approx \\sigma_{dc} / (\\omega \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon')$, which gives the observed $\\tan\\delta \\propto 1/\\omega$ dependence. This signature points to a conductivity-related process.\nThe dependence on sample thickness $t$ is more definitive. For a simple model of electrode polarization (a type of MW effect), the sample is treated as a bulk material in series with a thin interfacial layer at the electrodes. The total capacitance at low frequency is dominated by the interfacial layer capacitance, $C_{total}(\\omega \\to 0) \\approx C_{interface}$. The capacitance of this layer is $C_{interface} = \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_{interface} A / d_{interface}$, where $A$ is the electrode area and $d_{interface}$ is the thickness of the interfacial layer, a constant value. The apparent permittivity is defined as $\\varepsilon'_{app} = C_{total} t / (A \\varepsilon_0)$. Substituting $C_{total} \\approx C_{interface}$, we find $\\varepsilon'_{app} \\approx (\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_{interface} A / d_{interface}) \\cdot t / (A \\varepsilon_0) = (\\varepsilon_{interface}/d_{interface}) t$. Thus, $\\varepsilon'_{app} \\propto t$. This is exactly what is observed. Intrinsic permittivity is a bulk property and must be independent of sample dimensions. Therefore, these combined observations are classic signatures of extrinsic interfacial polarization.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. If the low-frequency relaxation peak frequency $f_{p}(T)$ follows $\\ln f_{p}\\propto -E_{a}/(k_{B}T)$ with the same activation energy $E_{a}$ as the dc conductivity, this identifies the process as intrinsic relaxor dipolar dynamics.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The relationship $\\ln f_{p}\\propto -E_{a}/(k_{B}T)$ is the Arrhenius law for a thermally activated process. The fact that the activation energy $E_a$ is identical to that for DC conductivity provides direct evidence that the relaxation mechanism is governed by the long-range transport of charge carriers. This is the defining characteristic of conductivity-driven relaxation phenomena, such as Maxwell-Wagner polarization. The charge carriers must move through the material to accumulate at interfaces, and the rate of this process (manifesting as $f_p$) is determined by their mobility, which also governs the DC conductivity. Intrinsic relaxor dynamics involve the reorientation of localized PNRs and are not directly coupled to DC conductivity in this manner; they follow the VFT law near $T_m$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Sensitivity of the low-frequency dielectric step to electrode material, while the high-frequency broad $\\varepsilon'(T)$ maximum remains unchanged, supports that the step is interfacial and the high-frequency maximum is intrinsic.**\nThis describes a fundamental experimental test to distinguish bulk from surface/interface effects. The problem states that changing the electrode material modifies the low-frequency behavior. Since the only thing changed is the interface between the sample and the electrical contact, the phenomenon must be interfacial in nature. The problem also states that the high-frequency $\\varepsilon'(T)$ maximum, which corresponds to the relaxor dynamics (see A), is *unaffected* by changing the electrodes. This confirms that this process is a property of the bulk material itself, i.e., it is intrinsic. The statement correctly interprets these observations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. In the electric modulus representation $M''(\\omega)$, if the peak attributed to interfacial polarization shifts to higher frequency when thickness $t$ increases, while another peak is thickness-independent, then the thickness-dependent peak must be intrinsic.**\nThis statement contains two fundamental errors.\nFirst, its premise contradicts both the problem's data and standard physical models. The problem explicitly states that the low-frequency peak frequency $f_p$ shifts to *lower* values as $t$ increases. Furthermore, as shown in the analysis for B, the relaxation time for electrode polarization is often proportional to thickness, $\\tau \\propto t$, which means the peak frequency $f_p = 1/(2\\pi\\tau) \\propto 1/t$. An increase in thickness $t$ causes a *decrease* in frequency $f_p$.\nSecond, the conclusion is logically flawed. An intrinsic property of a material, such as its permittivity or bulk relaxation frequency, must be independent of the sample's extrinsic dimensions (like thickness). Any property that shows a dependence on thickness is, by definition, not a purely intrinsic bulk property. Therefore, a thickness-dependent peak must be extrinsic (e.g., interfacial), while the thickness-independent peak is the candidate for the intrinsic process. The statement makes the exact opposite conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2517520"}, {"introduction": "Having identified the unique dielectric fingerprint of relaxors, we now explore its structural origins.

Using only geometric relations of the ideal cubic perovskite lattice, first derive a dimensionless ratio that quantifies the size matching between the $\\mathrm{A}$-site and $\\mathrm{B}$-site polyhedra in terms of the ionic radii $r_A$, $r_B$, and $r_O$.

Your numerical answer should be only the dimensionless size-matching ratio.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid-state chemistry and crystallography, specifically concerning the structure of perovskite oxides. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. We will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a dimensionless ratio for geometric compatibility in an ideal cubic perovskite lattice, $\\mathrm{ABO_3}$, followed by its calculation for lead magnesium niobate, $\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{Mg}_{1/3}\\mathrm{Nb}_{2/3})\\mathrm{O}_{3}$. This ratio is known as the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, denoted by the symbol $t$.\n\nWe model the structure using the hard-sphere approximation, where ions are spheres with specific radii in contact with their nearest neighbors. Let the lattice parameter of the ideal cubic unit cell be $a$.\n\nFirst, consider the corner-sharing $\\mathrm{BO_6}$ octahedra. The $\\mathrm{B}$-site cation is located at the body-center of the cube, $(a/2, a/2, a/2)$, and the $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ anions are at the face centers, such as $(a/2, a/2, 0)$. The distance between the center of the $\\mathrm{B}$ cation and an adjacent $\\mathrm{O}$ anion is half the lattice parameter, $a/2$. In the ideal packing model, these two ions are in contact. Therefore, the sum of their radii must equal this distance:\n$$r_B + r_O = \\frac{a}{2}$$\nThis equation gives a relationship for the lattice parameter based on the $\\mathrm{B}$-site and oxygen polyhedra:\n$$a = 2(r_B + r_O)$$\n\nNext, consider the $\\mathrm{A}$-site cation, which occupies the corner of the unit cell, for example at $(0,0,0)$. This cation is coordinated by $12$ oxygen anions. An $\\mathrm{A}$-$\\mathrm{O}$ bond lies along the face diagonal of the unit cell. The distance from a corner cation to an oxygen anion at a face center, such as $(a/2, a/2, 0)$, is given by the distance formula:\n$$d_{A-O} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{a}{2})^2 + (\\frac{a}{2})^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2}{4}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nFor ideal packing, the $\\mathrm{A}$-site cation and the oxygen anion are also in contact along this direction. Thus, the sum of their radii must equal this distance:\n$$r_A + r_O = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThis yields a second relationship for the lattice parameter, based on the $\\mathrm{A}$-site environment:\n$$a = \\sqrt{2}(r_A + r_O)$$\n\nFor a perfect, strain-free ideal cubic perovskite structure, both geometric conditions must be satisfied simultaneously. By equating the two expressions for the lattice parameter $a$, we find the condition for ideal matching:\n$$2(r_B + r_O) = \\sqrt{2}(r_A + r_O)$$\nThe dimensionless tolerance factor $t$ is formulated to be equal to $1$ when this ideal condition is met. It is defined by rearranging the relationship between the two key bond lengths:\n$$t = \\frac{r_A + r_O}{\\sqrt{2}(r_B + r_O)}$$\nThis is the required dimensionless ratio that quantifies the size matching between the A-site and B-site frameworks.\n\nNow, we compute this value for $\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{Mg}_{1/3}\\mathrm{Nb}_{2/3})\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ (PMN) using the provided Shannon ionic radii. The B-site in PMN is disordered, containing both $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ and $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$ ions. We must first calculate the stoichiometrically averaged B-site radius, $r_B$, as specified.\nGiven: $r_A = r_{\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}} = 1.49$ Å, $r_O = r_{\\mathrm{O}^{2-}} = 1.40$ Å, $r_{\\mathrm{Mg}} = r_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}} = 0.72$ Å, and $r_{\\mathrm{Nb}} = r_{\\mathrm{Nb}^{5+}} = 0.64$ Å.\n$$r_B = \\frac{1}{3}r_{\\mathrm{Mg}} + \\frac{2}{3}r_{\\mathrm{Nb}} = \\frac{1}{3}(0.72) + \\frac{2}{3}(0.64) = \\frac{0.72 + 1.28}{3} = \\frac{2.00}{3} \\text{ Å}$$\nNow, we substitute the radii values into the tolerance factor equation:\n$$t = \\frac{1.49 + 1.40}{\\sqrt{2}(\\frac{2.00}{3} + 1.40)} = \\frac{2.89}{\\sqrt{2}(\\frac{2.00}{3} + \\frac{1.40 \\times 3}{3})} = \\frac{2.89}{\\sqrt{2}(\\frac{2.00 + 4.20}{3})}$$\n$$t = \\frac{2.89}{\\sqrt{2}(\\frac{6.20}{3})} = \\frac{3 \\times 2.89}{\\sqrt{2} \\times 6.20} = \\frac{8.67}{8.7681...}$$\n$$t \\approx 0.988803$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $t = 0.9888$.\n\nFinally, we must interpret this result. A tolerance factor $t  1$ indicates that the $\\mathrm{A}$-site cation is too small for the cuboctahedral cavity formed by the ideal framework of corner-sharing $\\mathrm{BO_6}$ octahedra. Alternatively, the $\\mathrm{BO_6}$ framework is too large for the $\\mathrm{A}$-site cation. To relieve the resulting tensile strain on the $\\mathrm{A}$-$\\mathrm{O}$ bonds and compressive strain on the $\\mathrm{B}$-$\\mathrm{O}$ bonds, the crystal structure must distort from the ideal cubic symmetry. A primary mechanism to accommodate this mismatch is the cooperative tilting or rotation of the $\\mathrm{BO_6}$ octahedra. This tilting reduces the volume of the $\\mathrm{A}$-site cavity, allowing for more stable $\\mathrm{A}$-$\\mathrm{O}$ bonding. Therefore, the calculated value of $t = 0.9888$, being less than unity, strongly suggests that the $\\mathrm{BO_6}$ framework in PMN is prone to octahedral tilting.\n\nThis structural propensity for tilting is a key factor supporting the local heterogeneity characteristic of relaxor ferroelectrics. Relaxor behavior is defined by the presence of polar nanoregions (PNRs) within a globally non-polar matrix. In PMN, the random distribution of $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ and $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$ on the B-site creates significant chemical disorder and random local electric fields. The inherent instability of the ideal cubic lattice, evidenced by $t  1$ and the resulting tendency for octahedral tilting, makes the structure highly susceptible to these local random fields. The lattice can easily adopt local, non-cubic distortions in response to the specific chemical environment. The tilting provides a \"soft\" structural degree of freedom that facilitates the formation of PNRs with local polar character, while the frustration induced by both chemical disorder and competing tilt systems prevents these regions from coalescing into a macroscopic ferroelectric domain. Thus, the calculated tolerance factor supports the view that PMN possesses an intrinsic structural instability that, when coupled with its inherent chemical disorder, gives rise to the complex local structure and characteristic properties of a relaxor ferroelectric.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9888}$$", "id": "2517556"}, {"introduction": "The fundamental understanding of relaxor behavior enables us to engineer their domain structures for extraordinary piezoelectric performance.

The units are Pa$^{-1} \\cdot$ F/m = (N/m$^2$)$^{-1} \\cdot$ (C/V)/m = (m$^2$/N) $\\cdot$ C/(J/C)/m = (m$^2$/N) $\\cdot$ C$^2$/(N$\\cdot$m)/m = C$^2$/N$^2$.\n$$(3.79 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (4.428 \\times 10^{-8}) = 1.678212 \\times 10^{-18}$$\nSo,\n$$d_{33} = 0.82 \\sqrt{1.678212 \\times 10^{-18} \\frac{\\text{C}^2}{\\text{N}^2}}$$\n$$d_{33} = 0.82 \\times (1.295458 \\times 10^{-9} \\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{N}})$$\n$$d_{33} = 1.0622757 \\times 10^{-9} \\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{N}}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in units of picocoulombs per newton (pC/N). Since $1$ pC $= 10^{-12}$ C, we have:\n$$d_{33} = 1062.2757 \\times 10^{-12} \\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{N}} = 1062.2757 \\frac{\\text{pC}}{\\text{N}}$$\nFinally, we round the answer to three significant figures as instructed:\n$$d_{33} \\approx 1060 \\frac{\\text{pC}}{\\text{N}}$$\nThe computed value is consistent with high-performance domain-engineered relaxor ferroelectric single crystals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1060}$$", "id": "2517535"}]}
