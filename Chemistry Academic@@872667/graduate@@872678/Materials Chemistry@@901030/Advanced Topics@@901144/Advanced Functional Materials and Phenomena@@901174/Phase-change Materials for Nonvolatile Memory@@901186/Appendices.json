We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between current density $J$, conductivity $\\sigma$, and electric field $E$ is the constitutive relation $J = \\sigma E$. For a uniform material with cross-sectional area $A$ and length $L$ across which a voltage $V$ is applied, the electric field is $E=V/L$ (assuming uniformity as stated), and the total current is $I = J A$. Combining these, we find $I = (\\sigma E) A = \\sigma (V/L) A$. The conductance $G$ is defined as $G = I/V$, so $G = \\sigma A/L$. Resistivity $\\rho$ is the reciprocal of conductivity, $\\rho = 1/\\sigma$. Thus, the resistance $R = 1/G = \\rho L/A$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the fully RESET state. The device is entirely amorphous, with resistivity $\\rho_a$. The cross-sectional area for current flow is $A_{\\mathrm{total}} = w t$. The measured conductance in this state, $G_{\\mathrm{RESET}}$, which is equal to $I_{\\mathrm{RESET}}/V$, is given by:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{RESET}} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{RESET}}}{V} = \\frac{1}{\\rho_{a}} \\frac{w t}{L}\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the amorphous resistivity $\\rho_a$ in terms of the measured quantities and device geometry:\n$$\n\\rho_{a} = \\frac{V}{I_{\\mathrm{RESET}}} \\frac{w t}{L}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the partially SET state. The problem specifies a model of two parallel conducting channels along the length $L$: a crystalline filament and the surrounding amorphous matrix. The total conductance of parallel conductors is the sum of their individual conductances.\n\nThe crystalline filament has width $w_f$, thickness $t$, and resistivity $\\rho_c$. Its cross-sectional area is $A_c = w_f t$. Its conductance, $G_c$, is:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\frac{1}{\\rho_{c}} \\frac{w_f t}{L}\n$$\n\nThe remaining amorphous matrix has width $(w - w_f)$, thickness $t$, and resistivity $\\rho_a$. Its cross-sectional area is $A_a' = (w - w_f)t$. Its conductance, $G_a'$, is:\n$$\nG_{a'} = \\frac{1}{\\rho_{a}} \\frac{(w - w_f)t}{L}\n$$\n\nThe total conductance in the partially SET state, $G_{\\mathrm{PART}} = I_{\\mathrm{PART}}/V$, is the sum $G_c + G_a'$:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{PART}} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{PART}}}{V} = G_{c} + G_{a'} = \\frac{1}{\\rho_{c}} \\frac{w_f t}{L} + \\frac{1}{\\rho_{a}} \\frac{(w - w_f)t}{L}\n$$\nOur objective is to find the ratio $\\rho_a / \\rho_c$.

Using our expressions for $\\rho_a$ and $1/\\rho_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_{a}}{\\rho_{c}} = \\left(\\frac{V}{I_{\\mathrm{RESET}}} \\frac{w t}{L}\\right) \\left[ \\frac{L}{w_f t} \\left( \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{PART}}}{V} - \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{RESET}}}{V} \\frac{w - w_f}{w} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe terms $V$, $L$, and $t$ cancel, simplifying the expression significantly:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_{a}}{\\rho_{c}} = \\frac{w}{I_{\\mathrm{RESET}} w_f} \\left( I_{\\mathrm{PART}} - I_{\\mathrm{RESET}} \\frac{w - w_f}{w} \\right)\n$$\nDistributing the leading term, we arrive at the final closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_{a}}{\\rho_{c}} = \\frac{w}{w_f} \\left( \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{PART}}}{I_{\\mathrm{RESET}}} - \\frac{w - w_f}{w} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression relates the resistivity ratio to the measured currents and the device geometry, as required.\n\nFor the justification part: the observation of a low-resistance (high-conductance) partially SET state is explained by the creation of a continuous, percolating path of highly conductive crystalline material. Our derived relation $G_{\\mathrm{PART}} = G_c + G_a'$ shows that the total conductance is the sum of contributions from the crystalline filament and the amorphous matrix. The large calculated ratio $\\rho_a/\\rho_c \\gg 1$ implies $\\sigma_c \\gg \\sigma_a$. Consequently, the filament's conductance $G_c$ will be far greater than the matrix's conductance $G_a'$, meaning $G_{\\mathrm{PART}} \\approx G_c$. The current preferentially flows through this low-resistivity filament, bypassing the high-resistivity matrix. This is the definition of a percolation-dominated transport mechanism, which is consistent with the sharp increase in current from $I_{\\mathrm{RESET}}$ to $I_{\\mathrm{PART}}$ upon formation of a single filament spanning the device.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the ratio numerically using the provided data: $w = 100\\,\\text{nm}$, $w_f = 20\\,\\text{nm}$, $I_{\\mathrm{RESET}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{A}$, and $I_{\\mathrm{PART}} = 6.667 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{A}$.\n\nThe current ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{PART}}}{I_{\\mathrm{RESET}}} = \\frac{6.667 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{A}}{8.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{A}} = 83.3375\n$$\nThe geometric ratios are:\n$$\n\\frac{w}{w_f} = \\frac{100\\,\\text{nm}}{20\\,\\text{nm}} = 5\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{w - w_f}{w} = \\frac{100\\,\\text{nm} - 20\\,\\text{nm}}{100\\,\\text{nm}} = \\frac{80}{100} = 0.8\n$$\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_{a}}{\\rho_{c}} = 5 \\times (83.3375 - 0.8) = 5 \\times 82.5375 = 412.6875\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the result is $413$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{413}\n$$", "id": "2507657"}, {"introduction": "Achieving fast write speeds is paramount in memory technology, and for PCM, this translates to controlling the kinetics of the amorphous-to-crystalline transition (the SET process).
