I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n### Derivation of the Kinetic Model\n\nI will systematically construct the mathematical description of the system based on the provided information.\n\n1.  **Elementary Steps and Rate Expressions:**\n    -   **Step 1: Dissociative adsorption/desorption of oxygen.** A gas-phase $\\mathrm{O_2}$ molecule requires two adjacent vacant sites ($*$) to dissociate into two adsorbed oxygen atoms ($\\mathrm{O*}$). The reverse process is the recombination of two $\\mathrm{O*}$ atoms to form and desorb an $\\mathrm{O_2}$ molecule.\n        The reaction is: $\\mathrm{O_2(g)} + 2* \\rightleftharpoons 2\\mathrm{O*}$.\n        The forward rate ($r_1$) must be proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen, $p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$, and the probability of finding two vacant sites. Assuming a well-mixed surface (mean-field approximation), this probability is proportional to $\\theta_{*}^{2}$.\n        $$r_{1} = k_{1}\\,p_{\\mathrm{O_2}}\\,\\theta_{*}^{2}$$\n        The reverse rate ($r_{-1}$) must be proportional to the probability of finding two adsorbed oxygen atoms, which is proportional to $\\theta_{\\mathrm{O}}^{2}$.\n        $$r_{-1} = k_{-1}\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{O}}^{2}$$\n    -   **Step 2: Non-dissociative adsorption/desorption of carbon monoxide.** A gas-phase $\\mathrm{CO}$ molecule requires one vacant site ($*$) to adsorb.\n        The reaction is: $\\mathrm{CO(g)} + * \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CO*}$.\n        The forward rate ($r_2$) is proportional to the partial pressure of carbon monoxide, $p_{\\mathrm{CO}}$, and the availability of single vacant sites, $\\theta_{*}$.\n        $$r_{2} = k_{2}\\,p_{\\mathrm{CO}}\\,\\theta_{*}$$\n        The reverse rate ($r_{-2}$) is proportional to the coverage of adsorbed carbon monoxide, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{CO}}$.\n        $$r_{-2} = k_{-2}\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{CO}}$$\n    -   **Step 3: Surface recombination.** An adsorbed $\\mathrm{CO*}$ reacts with an adsorbed $\\mathrm{O*}$ to produce a $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ molecule which desorbs, leaving two vacant sites. The step is stated to be irreversible.\n        The reaction is: $\\mathrm{CO*} + \\mathrm{O*} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO_2(g)} + 2*$.\n        The rate ($r_3$) is proportional to the probability of finding an adjacent $\\mathrm{CO*}$ and $\\mathrm{O*}$, which is proportional to the product of their coverages, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{CO}}\\theta_{\\mathrm{O}}$.\n        $$r_{3} = k_{3}\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{CO}}\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{O}}$$\n\n2.  **Site Balance:**\n    The surface can be vacant ($*$), covered by a $\\mathrm{CO}$ molecule ($\\mathrm{CO*}$), or covered by an oxygen atom ($\\mathrm{O*}$).

Therefore, the sum of the fractional coverages must equal $1$.\n    $$\\theta_{*} + \\theta_{\\mathrm{CO}} + \\theta_{\\mathrm{O}} = 1$$\n    This matches the equation given in the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Steady-State Equations for Intermediates:**\n    The surface intermediates are $\\mathrm{O*}$ and $\\mathrm{CO*}$. The steady-state approximation sets their net rate of formation to zero.\n    -   **For adsorbed oxygen ($\\mathrm{O*}$):** $\\mathrm{O*}$ is produced in step 1 (stoichiometric coefficient $+2$) and consumed in step -1 (stoichiometric coefficient $-2$) and step 3 (stoichiometric coefficient $-1$).\n        $$\\frac{d\\theta_{\\mathrm{O}}}{dt} = 2r_{1} - 2r_{-1} - r_{3} = 0$$\n    -   **For adsorbed carbon monoxide ($\\mathrm{CO*}$):** $\\mathrm{CO*}$ is produced in step 2 (stoichiometric coefficient $+1$) and consumed in step -2 (stoichiometric coefficient $-1$) and step 3 (stoichiometric coefficient $-1$).\n        $$\\frac{d\\theta_{\\mathrm{CO}}}{dt} = r_{2} - r_{-2} - r_{3} = 0$$\n\n4.  **Net Rate of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ Formation:**\n    The product, $\\mathrm{CO_2}$, is formed only in elementary step 3. The stoichiometric coefficient for $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ in step 3 is $1$.\n    $$r_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = r_3$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow I will evaluate each option against my derived model.\n\n**A.**\n-   Elementary steps and rates: $r_{1}=k_{1}\\,p_{\\text{O}_2}\\,\\theta_{*}^{2}$, $r_{-1}=k_{-1}\\,\\theta_{\\text{O}}^{2}$; $r_{2}=k_{2}\\,p_{\\text{CO}}\\,\\theta_{*}$, $r_{-2}=k_{-2}\\,\\theta_{\\text{CO}}$; $r_{3}=k_{3}\\,\\theta_{\\text{CO}}\\,\\theta_{\\text{O}}$.

This contradicts the problem statement, which specifies **dissociative** adsorption. The proposed mechanism is fundamentally different.\n-   Steady-state: The equation $\\dfrac{d\\theta_{\\text{O}}}{dt}=r_{3}=0$ is nonsensical. If the only step producing the intermediate $\\mathrm{O*}$ is irreversible, its concentration cannot be at a non-zero steady state unless the rate of that step is zero, which would mean no $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ production.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**. This option proposes a different, and mechanistically flawed, reaction scheme.\n\n**C.**\n-   Elementary steps and rates: The rate expression for oxygen adsorption, $r_{1}=k_{1}\\,p_{\\text{O}_2}\\,\\theta_{*}$, is incorrect. A two-site process must have a rate proportional to $\\theta_{*}^{2}$. Similarly, the desorption rate $r_{-1}=k_{-1}\\,\\theta_{\\text{O}}$ is incorrect for a recombination of two atoms; it should be proportional to $\\theta_{\\text{O}}^{2}$.\n-   Steady-state: The oxygen balance $\\dfrac{d\\theta_{\\text{O}}}{dt}=r_{1}-r_{-1}-r_{3}=0$ is incorrect. It fails to include the stoichiometric coefficients of $2$ for the formation and consumption of $\\mathrm{O*}$ in the first elementary step ($2r_1 - 2r_{-1}$).\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**. This option contains fundamental errors in applying the law of mass action and in writing the species mass balance.\n\n**D.**\n-   Elementary steps and rates: These are formulated correctly, same as in option A.\n-   Site balance: $\\theta_{*}+\\theta_{\\text{CO}}+2\\theta_{\\text{O}}=1$. This expression is **incorrect**. It implies that each adsorbed oxygen atom ($\\mathrm{O*}$) occupies two surface sites, which is physically implausible and contradicts the standard convention provided in the problem statement ($\\theta_{*}+\\theta_{\\mathrm{CO}}+\\theta_{\\mathrm{O}}=1$). While models can be constructed with such assumptions, it is not the one described here.\n-   Steady-state and Net rate: The equations themselves are written correctly based on the step stoichiometry. However, the entire model is invalid due to the flawed site balance constraint.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**. The site balance equation contradicts the problem description and standard chemical assumptions for this system.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, only Option A presents a fully correct and self-consistent model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2489831"}, {"introduction": "The Sabatier principle posits that an ideal catalyst binds reactants neither too strongly nor too weakly, a concept visualized by 'volcano plots' of activity versus a binding energy descriptor.

First, we collect the terms containing $E_{\\mathrm{OH,opt}}$ on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other.\n$$(0.7 + 0.4)\\,E_{\\mathrm{OH,opt}} = 1.2 - 0.3$$\n$$1.1\\,E_{\\mathrm{OH,opt}} = 0.9$$\nSolving for $E_{\\mathrm{OH,opt}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{OH,opt}} = \\frac{0.9}{1.1} = \\frac{9}{11}\\ \\text{eV}$$\nThe problem, however, requires the determination of the optimal *oxygen* adsorption energy, $E_{\\mathrm{O,opt}}$, not the hydroxyl energy. We must use the provided linear scaling relation that connects $E_{\\mathrm{OH}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{O}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{OH}} = 0.5\\,E_{\\mathrm{O}} + 0.2$$\nWe must invert this relation to express $E_{\\mathrm{O}}$ as a function of $E_{\\mathrm{OH}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{OH}} - 0.2 = 0.5\\,E_{\\mathrm{O}}$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{O}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{OH}} - 0.2}{0.5} = 2(E_{\\mathrm{OH}} - 0.2)$$\nNow, we substitute the calculated value of $E_{\\mathrm{OH,opt}}$ into this expression to find the corresponding optimal oxygen adsorption energy, $E_{\\mathrm{O,opt}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{O,opt}} = 2(E_{\\mathrm{OH,opt}} - 0.2) = 2\\left(\\frac{9}{11} - 0.2\\right)$$\nTo maintain precision, we work with fractions:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{O,opt}} = 2\\left(\\frac{9}{11} - \\frac{2}{10}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{9}{11} - \\frac{1}{5}\\right)$$\nWe find a common denominator to perform the subtraction:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{O,opt}} = 2\\left(\\frac{9 \\times 5}{11 \\times 5} - \\frac{1 \\times 11}{5 \\times 11}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{45 - 11}{55}\\right)$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{O,opt}} = 2\\left(\\frac{34}{55}\\right) = \\frac{68}{55}$$\nThe final step is to compute the numerical value and round it to four significant figures as required.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{O,opt}} = \\frac{68}{55} \\approx 1.2363636...$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $1.236$.
