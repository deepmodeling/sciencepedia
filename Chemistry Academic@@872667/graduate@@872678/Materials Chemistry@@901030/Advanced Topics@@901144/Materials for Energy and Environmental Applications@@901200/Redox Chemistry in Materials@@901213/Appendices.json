We will proceed to a solution based on the fundamental principle of charge neutrality.\n\nThe chemical formula of the perovskite oxide is given as $\\mathrm{La_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}MnO_{3-\\delta}}$. The principle of charge neutrality dictates that the sum of all positive and negative oxidation states within a formula unit must equal zero.

This process corresponds to the following chemical reaction, written per mole of the $\\mathrm{MO}_2$ framework:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Li}_{x_1}\\mathrm{MO}_2 + (x_2 - x_1)\\,\\mathrm{Li} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Li}_{x_2}\\mathrm{MO}_2\n$$\nIn an electrochemical cell, the lithium is provided by the anode, typically lithium metal, $\\mathrm{Li(s)}$. The Gibbs free energy change for this reaction, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$, is given by the difference in the Gibbs free energies of the products and the reactants:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = G_{\\mathrm{compound}}(x_2) - \\left[ G_{\\mathrm{compound}}(x_1) + (x_2 - x_1)G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}} \\right]\n$$\nwhere $G_{\\mathrm{compound}}(x)$ is the Gibbs free energy of one mole of $\\mathrm{Li}_x\\mathrm{MO}_2$ and $G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}}$ is the Gibbs free energy of one mole of solid lithium.\n\nThe problem provides the grand potential $G(x)$, which is defined relative to lithium metal:\n$$\nG(x) \\equiv G_{\\mathrm{compound}}(x) - x\\,G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this definition to express $G_{\\mathrm{compound}}(x)$ as:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{compound}}(x) = G(x) + x\\,G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $G_{\\mathrm{compound}}(x_1)$ and $G_{\\mathrm{compound}}(x_2)$ into the equation for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = \\left[ G(x_2) + x_2\\,G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}} \\right] - \\left[ \\left( G(x_1) + x_1\\,G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}} \\right) + (x_2 - x_1)G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}} \\right]\n$$\nWe simplify the terms involving $G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = G(x_2) + x_2\\,G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}} - G(x_1) - x_1\\,G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}} - x_2\\,G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}} + x_1\\,G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}}\n$$\nThe terms $x_2\\,G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}}$ and $x_1\\,G_{\\mathrm{Li(s)}}$ cancel out, leading to a remarkably simple result:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = G(x_2) - G(x_1)\n$$\nThis demonstrates the utility of the grand potential formalism. The total number of moles of electrons transferred, $N_{\\mathrm{e}}$, during the insertion of $(x_2 - x_1)$ moles of lithium is $(x_2 - x_1)$, since it is given that one electron is transferred per lithium atom.\n\nSubstituting these results into the fundamental electrochemical equation, we obtain an expression for the average voltage, $E_{\\mathrm{avg}}$, over the composition range $[x_1, x_2]$:\n$$\nG(x_2) - G(x_1) = -(x_2 - x_1) F E_{\\mathrm{avg}}\n$$\nSolving for $E_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ yields the desired expression:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{avg}} = -\\frac{G(x_2) - G(x_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)F}\n$$\nThis expression is equivalent to the negative of the slope of the chord connecting the points $(x_1, G(x_1))$ and $(x_2, G(x_2))$ on the grand potential curve, divided by the Faraday constant.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. It is assumed that the DFT-calculated total energies at $0~\\mathrm{K}$ are a valid approximation for the Gibbs free energies at room temperature. This implies that changes in entropic contributions ($T\\Delta S$) and volume-work ($P\\Delta V$) during the reaction are negligible compared to the change in enthalpy.

A significant contribution to $R_p$ arises from charge transport limitations within the electrode bulk. For an MIEC, the effective conductivity relevant to the electrochemical reaction is the ambipolar conductivity, which is limited by the less conductive species. In this case, the transport of oxide ions is the bottleneck. While electrons are readily supplied throughout the electrode volume due to the high electronic conductivity, the slow movement of oxide ions away from reaction sites severely restricts the overall reaction rate. This transport limitation manifests as a large contribution to the total polarization resistance, $R_p$. Consequently, the electrode performance is poor.
