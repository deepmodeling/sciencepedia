All necessary data for the derivation and calculation are provided. The values for material properties are physically realistic for the specified constituents. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe analysis is based on three foundational principles provided in the problem statement. Let $\\sigma$ denote axial stress, $\\epsilon$ denote axial strain, $E$ denote Young's modulus, $V$ denote volume fraction, $A$ denote cross-sectional area, and $F$ denote axial force. The subscripts $c$, $f$, and $m$ will denote the composite, fiber, and matrix, respectively.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equations based on the stated principles.\n\n1.  **Small-Strain Linear Elasticity**: The axial stress in each constituent is proportional to the axial strain, according to Hooke's Law.\n    $$ \\sigma_f = E_f \\epsilon_f $$\n    $$ \\sigma_m = E_m \\epsilon_m $$\n    The composite as a whole is treated as a homogeneous material with an effective modulus $E_c$:\n    $$ \\sigma_c = E_c \\epsilon_c $$\n\n2.  **Strain Compatibility (Iso-Strain Condition)**: For a unidirectional composite loaded along the fiber direction, assuming perfect bonding, the axial strain is uniform throughout the material.\n    $$ \\epsilon_c = \\epsilon_f = \\epsilon_m \\equiv \\epsilon $$\n\n3.  **Force Equilibrium**: The total axial force $F_c$ acting on the composite's cross-section is the sum of the forces carried by the fibers ($F_f$) and the matrix ($F_m$).\n    $$ F_c = F_f + F_m $$\n\nWe now use these principles to derive the required expressions.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the composite axial modulus, $E_c$.\nFrom force equilibrium, we write forces in terms of average stresses and areas:\n$$ \\sigma_c A_c = \\sigma_f A_f + \\sigma_m A_m $$\nDividing by the total cross-sectional area $A_c$ yields the rule of mixtures for stress:\n$$ \\sigma_c = \\sigma_f \\frac{A_f}{A_c} + \\sigma_m \\frac{A_m}{A_c} $$\nFor a statistically homogeneous unidirectional composite, the area fraction of a constituent is equal to its volume fraction. Thus, $A_f/A_c = V_f$ and $A_m/A_c = V_m$.\n$$ \\sigma_c = \\sigma_f V_f + \\sigma_m V_m $$\nNow, we substitute the constitutive relations from linear elasticity and the iso-strain condition into this equation:\n$$ E_c \\epsilon_c = (E_f \\epsilon_f) V_f + (E_m \\epsilon_m) V_m $$\n$$ E_c \\epsilon = (E_f \\epsilon) V_f + (E_m \\epsilon) V_m $$\nSince the material is under load, the strain $\\epsilon$ is non-zero, allowing us to divide the entire equation by $\\epsilon$:\n$$ E_c = E_f V_f + E_m V_m $$\nThis is the well-known rule of mixtures for the longitudinal Young's modulus of a unidirectional composite. It is noted that the matrix Poisson's ratio $\\nu_m$ and yield strength $\\sigma_{y,m}$ are not required for this calculation, which considers only the initial linear elastic response in the axial direction.\n\nNext, we derive the expressions for the load fractions carried by the fibers, $\\phi_f$, and the matrix, $\\phi_m$.\nThe load fraction for a constituent is the ratio of the force it carries to the total force on the composite.

The solution will now proceed.\n\nThe derivation begins with the principle of axial force balance on a differential segment of the fiber. Let $x$ be the coordinate along the fiber axis. Consider a fiber segment of length $dx$. The axial force in the fiber at position $x$ is $P_f(x)$. The change in this force over the length $dx$ is $dP_f$. This change is balanced by the shear force exerted by the matrix on the circumferential surface of the fiber segment.\n\nThe interfacial shear force is the product of the constant interfacial shear strength, $\\tau_i$, and the surface area of the segment, $dA_s$. For a fiber of diameter $d$, the circumference is $\\pi d$, so the surface area is $dA_s = \\pi d \\, dx$. The force balance is thus:\n$$dP_f = \\tau_i \\, dA_s = \\tau_i (\\pi d) \\, dx$$\nThe axial force in the fiber is related to the axial stress in the fiber, $\\sigma_f(x)$, and the fiber's cross-sectional area, $A_f$. The cross-section is circular with diameter $d$, so $A_f = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$. The force is $P_f(x) = \\sigma_f(x) A_f$.\nSubstituting this into the force balance equation:\n$$d( \\sigma_f(x) A_f ) = \\tau_i \\pi d \\, dx$$\nSince the cross-sectional area $A_f$ is constant along the length of the fiber, this simplifies to:\n$$A_f \\frac{d\\sigma_f}{dx} = \\tau_i \\pi d$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A_f$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}\\right) \\frac{d\\sigma_f}{dx} = \\tau_i \\pi d$$\nSolving for the gradient of the axial stress in the fiber gives:\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma_f}{dx} = \\frac{4 \\tau_i}{d}$$\nThis equation shows that the stress builds up linearly along the fiber from its ends, where the stress is zero, i.e., $\\sigma_f(0) = 0$. By integrating from an end of the fiber (at $x=0$) to a point $x$ along its length, we find the stress profile:\n$$\\sigma_f(x) = \\int_0^x \\frac{4 \\tau_i}{d} \\, dx' = \\frac{4 \\tau_i}{d} x$$\nFor a fiber of total length $l$, the stress builds up from both ends towards the center. The maximum stress, $\\sigma_{f,\\text{max}}$, will occur at the midpoint of the fiber, which is at a distance of $l/2$ from either end.\n$$\\sigma_{f,\\text{max}} = \\sigma_f\\left(x=\\frac{l}{2}\\right) = \\frac{4 \\tau_i}{d} \\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2 \\tau_i l}{d}$$\nThe critical fiber length, $l_c$, is defined as the length at which this maximum stress first reaches the fiber's tensile strength, $\\sigma_f$.
