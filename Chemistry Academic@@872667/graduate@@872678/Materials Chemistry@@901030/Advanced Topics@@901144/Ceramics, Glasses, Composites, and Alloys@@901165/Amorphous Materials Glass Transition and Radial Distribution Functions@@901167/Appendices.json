We construct the Angell plot variables $x_i = T_{g,A}/T_i$ and $y_i = \\log_{10}(\\eta_i)$.\n1.  $T_1 = 320$: $x_1 = 320/320 = 1$, $y_1 = \\log_{10}(10^{12}) = 12$.\n2.  $T_2 = 330$: $x_2 = 320/330 = 32/33$, $y_2 = \\log_{10}(10^{107/11}) = 107/11$.\n3.  $T_3 = 340$: $x_3 = 320/340 = 16/17$, $y_3 = \\log_{10}(10^{129/17}) = 129/17$.\n\nTo simplify the OLS calculation, we introduce a shifted variable $u = 1 - x$. The regression $y = a + m x$ becomes $y = a + m(1-u) = (a+m) - mu$. This is a linear regression of $y$ on $u$ with slope $m' = -m$. The OLS calculation is simpler as one of the $u_i$ values is zero. The slope $m$ is then recovered as $m = -m'$.\nThe data points in $(u,y)$ coordinates are:\n1.  $u_1 = 1 - 1 = 0$, $y_1 = 12$.\n2.  $u_2 = 1 - 32/33 = 1/33$, $y_2 = 107/11$.\n3.  $u_3 = 1 - 16/17 = 1/17$, $y_3 = 129/17$.\n\nWe calculate the necessary sums for $N=3$:\n$\\sum u_i = 0 + \\frac{1}{33} + \\frac{1}{17} = \\frac{17+33}{561} = \\frac{50}{561}$.\n$\\sum y_i = 12 + \\frac{107}{11} + \\frac{129}{17} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 187 + 107 \\cdot 17 + 129 \\cdot 11}{187} = \\frac{2244 + 1819 + 1419}{187} = \\frac{5482}{187}$.\n$\\sum u_i^2 = 0^2 + (\\frac{1}{33})^2 + (\\frac{1}{17})^2 = \\frac{1}{1089} + \\frac{1}{289} = \\frac{289 + 1089}{314721} = \\frac{1378}{314721}$.\n$\\sum u_i y_i = 0 \\cdot 12 + \\frac{1}{33} \\cdot \\frac{107}{11} + \\frac{1}{17} \\cdot \\frac{129}{17} = \\frac{107}{363} + \\frac{129}{289} = \\frac{107 \\cdot 289 + 129 \\cdot 363}{104907} = \\frac{30923 + 46827}{104907} = \\frac{77750}{104907}$.\n\nThe slope $m'$ is:\n$m' = \\frac{N \\sum(u_i y_i) - (\\sum u_i)(\\sum y_i)}{N \\sum(u_i^2) - (\\sum u_i)^2}$\nNumerator: $3 \\cdot \\frac{77750}{104907} - \\frac{50}{561} \\cdot \\frac{5482}{187} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 77750 - 50 \\cdot 5482}{104907} = \\frac{233250 - 274100}{104907} = \\frac{-40850}{104907}$.\nDenominator: $3 \\cdot \\frac{1378}{314721} - (\\frac{50}{561})^2 = \\frac{3 \\cdot 1378 - 50^2}{561^2} = \\frac{4134 - 2500}{314721} = \\frac{1634}{314721}$.\n$m' = \\frac{-40850/104907}{1634/314721} = \\frac{-40850}{104907} \\cdot \\frac{314721}{1634} = \\frac{-40850 \\cdot 3}{1634} = \\frac{-122550}{1634} = -75$.\nThe fragility index for Liquid A is $m_A = -m' = 75$.\n\nCalculation for Liquid B:\nThe three points to be used are at $T = 280$ K, $T = 290$ K, and $T = 300$ K.\n$T_{g,B} = 280$ K.\n1.  $T_1 = 280$: $x_1 = 280/280=1$, $y_1 = 12$.\n2.  $T_2 = 290$: $x_2 = 280/290 = 28/29$, $y_2 = 328/29$.\n3.  $T_3 = 300$: $x_3 = 280/300 = 14/15$, $y_3 = 32/3$.\n\nUsing the shifted variable $u = 1-x$:\n1.  $u_1 = 0$, $y_1 = 12$.\n2.  $u_2 = 1 - 28/29 = 1/29$, $y_2 = 328/29$.\n3.  $u_3 = 1 - 14/15 = 1/15$, $y_3 = 32/3$.\n\nWe calculate the sums for $N=3$:\n$\\sum u_i = 0 + \\frac{1}{29} + \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{15+29}{435} = \\frac{44}{435}$.\n$\\sum y_i = 12 + \\frac{328}{29} + \\frac{32}{3} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 87 + 328 \\cdot 3 + 32 \\cdot 29}{87} = \\frac{1044 + 984 + 928}{87} = \\frac{2956}{87}$.\n$\\sum u_i^2 = 0^2 + (\\frac{1}{29})^2 + (\\frac{1}{15})^2 = \\frac{1}{841} + \\frac{1}{225} = \\frac{225 + 841}{189225} = \\frac{1066}{189225}$.\n$\\sum u_i y_i = 0 \\cdot 12 + \\frac{1}{29} \\cdot \\frac{328}{29} + \\frac{1}{15} \\cdot \\frac{32}{3} = \\frac{328}{841} + \\frac{32}{45} = \\frac{328 \\cdot 45 + 32 \\cdot 841}{37845} = \\frac{14760 + 26912}{37845} = \\frac{41672}{37845}$.\n\nThe slope $m'$ is:\nNumerator: $3 \\cdot \\frac{41672}{37845} - \\frac{44}{435} \\cdot \\frac{2956}{87} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 41672 - 44 \\cdot 2956}{37845} = \\frac{125016 - 130064}{37845} = \\frac{-5048}{37845}$.\nDenominator: $3 \\cdot \\frac{1066}{189225} - (\\frac{44}{435})^2 = \\frac{3 \\cdot 1066 - 44^2}{435^2} = \\frac{3198 - 1936}{189225} = \\frac{1262}{189225}$.\n$m' = \\frac{-5048/37845}{1262/189225} = \\frac-5048}{37845} \\cdot \\frac{189225}{1262} = \\frac{-5048 \\cdot 5}{1262} = \\frac{-25240}{1262} = -20$.\nThe fragility index for Liquid B is $m_B = -m' = 20$.\n\nComparison and Final Answer:\nThe fragility index for Liquid A is $m_A = 75$.\nThe fragility index for Liquid B is $m_B = 20$.\nSince $m_A > m_B$, Liquid A is more fragile than Liquid B.
