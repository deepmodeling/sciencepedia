It is a valid problem in materials chemistry, specifically in the topic of viscoelasticity. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe total strain $\\epsilon(t)$ in the Maxwell element is the sum of the strain in the spring, $\\epsilon_s(t)$, and the strain in the dashpot, $\\epsilon_d(t)$:\n$$\n\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_s(t) + \\epsilon_d(t)\n$$\nThe stress $\\sigma(t)$ is uniform throughout the series element:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_s(t) = \\sigma_d(t)\n$$\nThe constitutive relations for the individual elements are given as:\nFor the spring (Hooke's Law): $\\sigma_s(t) = E \\epsilon_s(t)$, which can be rewritten as $\\epsilon_s(t) = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{E}$.\nFor the dashpot (Newtonian fluid): $\\sigma_d(t) = \\eta \\frac{d\\epsilon_d(t)}{dt}$, which can be rewritten as $\\frac{d\\epsilon_d(t)}{dt} = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta}$.\n\nTo establish the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the Maxwell model, we differentiate the total strain equation with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d\\epsilon_s(t)}{dt} + \\frac{d\\epsilon_d(t)}{dt}\n$$\nNow, substitute the constitutive relations into this expression. The time derivative of the spring strain is $\\frac{d\\epsilon_s(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{E}\\frac{d\\sigma(t)}{dt}$. The rate of strain for the dashpot is given directly. Substitution yields the general constitutive ODE for the Maxwell model:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{E}\\frac{d\\sigma(t)}{dt} + \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis equation relates the total strain rate to the stress and the rate of change of stress.\n\nThe problem specifies a stress relaxation experiment, where a constant strain $\\epsilon_0$ is applied at $t=0$ and held constant thereafter. This is described by the strain history $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0 H(t)$. For all times $t  0$, the strain is constant, $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0$. Consequently, its time derivative is zero: $\\frac{d\\epsilon(t)}{dt} = 0$ for $t  0$.\nSubstituting this into the general ODE gives the specific ODE governing the stress $\\sigma(t)$ during relaxation for $t  0$:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{E}\\frac{d\\sigma(t)}{dt} + \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta}\n$$\nRearranging gives a first-order, linear, homogeneous ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{E}{\\eta} \\sigma(t)\n$$\nTo solve this ODE, a physically correct initial condition at $t=0^{+}$ is required. At the moment the strain $\\epsilon_0$ is applied, $t=0$, the response is instantaneous. The dashpot, which represents viscous flow, requires a finite time to deform. Therefore, at the instant of loading, its strain is zero: $\\epsilon_d(0^{+}) = 0$. The entire instantaneous strain must be accommodated by the elastic spring. Thus, at $t=0^{+}$, the spring strain is equal to the total applied strain: $\\epsilon_s(0^{+}) = \\epsilon(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_0$.\nThe initial stress in the system, $\\sigma(0^{+})$, is therefore determined exclusively by the spring's response:\n$$\n\\sigma(0^{+}) = E \\epsilon_s(0^{+}) = E \\epsilon_0\n$$\nThis is the required initial condition for the ODE.\n\nWe now solve the ODE $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dt} = -\\frac{E}{\\eta} \\sigma$ with the initial condition $\\sigma(0) = E \\epsilon_0$.

By comparing this definition with our derived expression for $\\sigma(t)$, we can identify $G(t)$:\n$$\nG(t) \\epsilon_0 = E \\epsilon_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\epsilon_0  0$, we can divide by it to obtain the final closed-form expression for the relaxation modulus:\n$$\nG(t) = E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\\right)\n$$\nThe expression for $G(t)$ contains a characteristic time, $\\tau = \\frac{\\eta}{E}$. This quantity has units of time (Viscosity/[Stress] $\\div$ [Stress] = [Time]) and is known as the relaxation time. Its physical interpretation arises from observing the stress decay. At time $t=\\tau$, the stress becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\tau) = E \\epsilon_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} \\frac{\\eta}{E}\\right) = E \\epsilon_0 \\exp(-1) = \\frac{\\sigma(0^{+})}{e}\n$$\nThus, the relaxation time $\\tau$ is the time required for the stress in the material to decay to $1/e$ (approximately $36.8\\%$) of its initial value following the application of a step strain. It is the characteristic timescale of the stress relaxation process for the Maxwell material. A long relaxation time (large $\\eta$ or small $E$) signifies a slow decay of internal stresses, characteristic of a more solid-like response, while a short relaxation time indicates a rapid dissipation of stress, characteristic of a more fluid-like response.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2536236"}, {"introduction": "Materials are often subjected to vibrations or oscillatory loads, making their frequency-dependent response critical.

The time derivative of the strain is $\\frac{d\\varepsilon(t)}{dt} = \\varepsilon_{0} \\delta(t)$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function. Substituting this into the superposition integral:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} G(t-t') \\left( \\varepsilon_{0} \\delta(t') \\right) dt'\n$$\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, which states that $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\delta(x-c) dx = f(c)$ for $acb$, we evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} G(t-0) = \\varepsilon_{0} G(t)\n$$\nThis derivation confirms that for a step strain $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} H(t)$, the resulting stress for $t0$ is $\\sigma(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} G(t)$. This is, in fact, the definition of the relaxation modulus $G(t)$.\n\nAnalogously, the strain $\\varepsilon(t)$ can be expressed as a functional of the stress history $\\sigma(t)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} J(t-t') \\frac{d\\sigma(t')}{dt'} dt'\n$$\nHere, $J(t)$ is the creep compliance, representing the strain response to a unit step stress applied at $t=0$.\n\nNow, consider a step stress input $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0} H(t)$. The time derivative is $\\frac{d\\sigma(t)}{dt} = \\sigma_{0} \\delta(t)$. Substituting this into the second superposition integral:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} J(t-t') \\left( \\sigma_{0} \\delta(t') \\right) dt'\n$$\nAgain, applying the sifting property of the delta function:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\sigma_{0} J(t-0) = \\sigma_{0} J(t)\n$$\nThis confirms that for a step stress $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0} H(t)$, the resulting strain for $t0$ is $\\varepsilon(t) = \\sigma_{0} J(t)$, which is the definition of the creep compliance $J(t)$.\n\n(b) Limiting Values and Their Relationship\n\nFor a viscoelastic solid, we define and interpret the limiting values as follows:\n- $G(0^{+}) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} G(t)$: This is the instantaneous modulus. It represents the material's immediate, purely elastic response to a suddenly applied strain, before any viscous flow or molecular rearrangement can occur. Physically, it corresponds to the \"glassy\" modulus of the polymer, where chains are effectively frozen on this timescale.\n- $G(\\infty) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} G(t)$: This is the equilibrium or long-time modulus. It is the finite stress that remains in a viscoelastic solid after all relaxation processes have completed under a constant applied strain. This non-zero modulus arises from the permanent cross-linked or entangled network structure that can support stress indefinitely. For a viscoelastic fluid, $G(\\infty)=0$.\n- $J(0^{+}) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} J(t)$: This is the instantaneous compliance. It is the material's immediate elastic strain response to a suddenly applied stress. It is the reciprocal of the instantaneous modulus.\n- $J(\\infty) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} J(t)$: This is the equilibrium or long-time compliance. It is the final, finite strain reached in a viscoelastic solid under a constant stress after all creep processes have ceased. It is the reciprocal of the equilibrium modulus. For a viscoelastic fluid that flows indefinitely, $J(\\infty)$ would be infinite.\n\nTo establish the relationship between these quantities, we consider the material's behavior in the short-time and long-time limits.\nAt the moment of load application, $t=0^{+}$, the viscous components of the material have not had time to respond. The material behaves as a perfectly elastic solid with an instantaneous elastic modulus $E_{inst}$.\nFor a step strain $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} H(t)$, the stress at $t=0^{+}$ is $\\sigma(0^{+}) = \\varepsilon_{0} G(0^{+})$.\nFrom the elastic definition, $\\sigma(0^{+}) = E_{inst} \\varepsilon(0^{+}) = E_{inst} \\varepsilon_{0}$.\nComparing these gives $G(0^{+}) = E_{inst}$.\nFor a step stress $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0} H(t)$, the strain at $t=0^{+}$ is $\\varepsilon(0^{+}) = \\sigma_{0} J(0^{+})$.\nFrom the elastic definition, $\\varepsilon(0^{+}) = \\sigma(0^{+}) / E_{inst} = \\sigma_{0} / E_{inst}$.\nComparing these gives $J(0^{+}) = 1 / E_{inst}$.\nTherefore, we establish the relationship for the instantaneous response:\n$$\nJ(0^{+}) = \\frac{1}{G(0^{+})}\n$$\nAs time approaches infinity, $t \\to \\infty$, the material reaches a state of mechanical equilibrium. It again behaves as a perfectly elastic solid, but now with an equilibrium elastic modulus $E_{eq}$.\nFor a step strain $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} H(t)$, the stress relaxes to an equilibrium value $\\sigma(\\infty) = \\varepsilon_{0} G(\\infty)$.\nFrom the elastic definition at equilibrium, $\\sigma(\\infty) = E_{eq} \\varepsilon(\\infty) = E_{eq} \\varepsilon_{0}$.\nComparing these gives $G(\\infty) = E_{eq}$.\nFor a step stress $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0} H(t)$, the strain creeps to an equilibrium value $\\varepsilon(\\infty) = \\sigma_{0} J(\\infty)$.\nFrom the elastic definition at equilibrium, $\\varepsilon(\\infty) = \\sigma(\\infty) / E_{eq} = \\sigma_{0} / E_{eq}$.\nComparing these gives $J(\\infty) = 1 / E_{eq}$.\nTherefore, for a viscoelastic solid with a finite non-zero equilibrium modulus, we establish the relationship for the long-time response:\n$$\nJ(\\infty) = \\frac{1}{G(\\infty)}\n$$\n\n(c) Calculation of the Dimensionless Scalar $R$\n\nThe given stress relaxation modulus is of the generalized Maxwell form:\n$$\nG(t)=G_{e}+g_{1}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{1}}\\right)+g_{2}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe parameters are given as $G_{e}=50\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $g_{1}=100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $g_{2}=150\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\tau_{1}=1\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $\\tau_{2}=10\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the instantaneous modulus $G(0^{+})$ by taking the limit as $t \\to 0^{+}$:\n$$\nG(0^{+}) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\left[ G_{e}+g_{1}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{1}}\\right)+g_{2}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{2}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\exp(0)=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nG(0^{+}) = G_{e} + g_{1} + g_{2} = 50\\,\\mathrm{MPa} + 100\\,\\mathrm{MPa} + 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 300\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the equilibrium modulus $G(\\infty)$ by taking the limit as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nG(\\infty) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ G_{e}+g_{1}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{1}}\\right)+g_{2}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{2}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp(-kt) = 0$ for $k0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nG(\\infty) = G_{e} = 50\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nUsing the relationships derived in part (b), we find the corresponding compliances:\n$$\nJ(0^{+}) = \\frac{1}{G(0^{+})} = \\frac{1}{300}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nJ(\\infty) = \\frac{1}{G(\\infty)} = \\frac{1}{50}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}^{-1}\n$$\nNow we can compute the dimensionless scalar $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{G(0^{+})}{G(\\infty)} + \\frac{J(\\infty)}{J(0^{+})}\n$$\nSubstituting the values we have calculated:\n$$\nR = \\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{50\\,\\mathrm{MPa}} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{50}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}^{-1}}{\\frac{1}{300}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}^{-1}}\n$$\nThe units cancel out, as expected for a dimensionless quantity. The calculation is:\n$$\nR = \\frac{300}{50} + \\frac{300}{50} = 6 + 6 = 12\n$$\nThe exact value of $R$ is $12$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{12}\n$$", "id": "2536212"}]}
