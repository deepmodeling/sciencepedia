Consider an organic crystalline solid in which all hydrogen sites are fully and stoichiometrically replaced by deuterium upon isotopic substitution, so that the number of isotopic sites is conserved on a one-to-one basis. Assume the following conditions:\n- The spectrometer geometry, incident flux, sample thickness, and multiple-scattering conditions are identical between measurements on the protiated and fully deuterated crystals.\n- Over a fixed energy-transfer window and fixed momentum-transfer acceptance, the energy-integrated incoherent inelastic intensity is proportional to the total number of incoherently scattering nuclei times their incoherent scattering cross-section.\n- Contributions from all non-hydrogenic elements to the incoherent inelastic intensity are negligible in both samples.\n- The hydrogenic and deuteronic incoherent scattering cross-sections are $ \\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(\\mathrm{H}) \\approx 80 \\ \\text{barn} $ and $ \\sigma_{\\text `inc}}(\\mathrm{D}) \\approx 2 \\ \\text{barn} $, respectively.\n\nStarting from the definitions of incoherent neutron scattering and the proportionality of the energy-integrated incoherent inelastic intensity to the total incoherent cross-section of the sample, derive the expected ratio of the energy-integrated incoherent inelastic intensity between the protiated and fully deuterated samples, $ I_{\\mathrm{H}}/I_{\\mathrm{D}} $.

It provides a set of clear, consistent conditions that describe a standard experimental scenario in materials chemistry and condensed matter physics. The physical principles invoked, namely those of inelastic neutron scattering (INS), are correctly stated. The data provided for the nuclear scattering cross-sections are accurate approximations of the accepted values. The problem is therefore valid for a formal solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between the measured incoherent inelastic scattering intensity and the microscopic properties of the sample. According to the problem statement, the energy-integrated incoherent inelastic intensity, which we shall denote as $I_{\\text{inc}}$, is proportional to the total macroscopic incoherent scattering cross-section of the sample. We can express this formally. Let $C$ be the constant of proportionality, which encapsulates all experimental factors such as incident neutron flux, detector efficiency, and sample geometry. The problem explicitly states these factors are identical for both measurements, so $C$ is the same for both the protiated and deuterated samples. The total incoherent cross-section is the sum of the microscopic incoherent cross-sections, $\\sigma_{\\text{inc},j}$, for all $N_j$ nuclei of type $j$ in the sample.\n\nThus, the intensity is given by:\n$$\nI_{\\text{inc}} = C \\sum_{j} N_j \\sigma_{\\text{inc},j}\n$$\n\nThe problem specifies two key conditions that simplify this expression. First, the contribution from all non-hydrogenic elements to the incoherent inelastic intensity is negligible. This is a sound and common approximation, as the incoherent cross-section of hydrogen is anomalously large compared to most other elements. Second, in the deuterated sample, all hydrogen atoms are replaced by deuterium on a one-to-one stoichiometric basis. This means if the protiated sample contains $N_{\\mathrm{H}}$ hydrogen atoms, the deuterated sample will contain $N_{\\mathrm{D}} = N_{\\mathrm{H}}$ deuterium atoms.\n\nLet us apply these principles to the two samples.\n\nFor the protiated sample (denoted by subscript H), the incoherent intensity $I_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is dominated by the hydrogen atoms.\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{H}} \\approx C \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{H}} \\cdot \\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(\\mathrm{H})\n$$\n\nFor the fully deuterated sample (denoted by subscript D), the incoherent intensity $I_{\\mathrm{D}}$ is similarly dominated by the deuterium atoms. As stated, the number of deuterium atoms $N_{\\mathrm{D}}$ is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms $N_{\\mathrm{H}}$ in the original sample.\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{D}} \\approx C \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{D}} \\cdot \\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(\\mathrm{D}) = C \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{H}} \\cdot \\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(\\mathrm{D})\n$$\n\nThe ratio of the energy-integrated incoherent inelastic intensity between the protiated and fully deuterated samples, $I_{\\mathrm{H}}/I_{\\mathrm{D}}$, can now be calculated by dividing the two expressions. The constant of proportionality $C$ and the number of scattering atoms $N_{\\mathrm{H}}$ cancel out.\n\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{H}}}{I_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{C \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{H}} \\cdot \\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(\\mathrm{H})}{C \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{H}} \\cdot \\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(\\mathrm{D})} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(\\mathrm{H})}{\\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(\\mathrm{D})}\n$$\n\nThe primary assumption made in this derivation, explicitly justified by the problem statement, is that the incoherent scattering from elements other than hydrogen or deuterium is insignificant and can be ignored.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the incoherent scattering cross-sections: $\\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(\\mathrm{H}) \\approx 80 \\ \\text{barn}$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(\\mathrm{D}) \\approx 2 \\ \\text{barn}$.\n\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{H}}}{I_{\\mathrm{D}}} \\approx \\frac{80}{2} = 40\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to two significant figures. The number $40$ can be written as $4.0 \\times 10^1$, which has two significant figures. Thus, the result is $40$.\n\nFor the qualitative commentary: Inelastic neutron scattering intensity is composed of two parts: a coherent component, $I_{\\text{coh}}$, and an incoherent component, $I_{\\text{inc}}$. Collective lattice vibrations, or phonons, give rise to sharp features in the *coherent* part of the scattering function, $S(\\mathbf{Q}, \\omega)$. The *incoherent* scattering, particularly the strong signal from hydrogen, contributes a large, often-featureless background across the entire energy-transfer range, which obscures the weaker coherent signal from phonons.\n\nOur calculation shows that upon deuteration, the incoherent intensity $I_{\\mathrm{D}}$ is reduced by a factor of approximately $40$ compared to $I_{\\mathrm{H}}$. This drastically lowers the background signal. Concurrently, deuterium possesses a significant coherent scattering cross-section ($\\sigma_{\\text{coh}}(\\mathrm{D}) \\approx 5.6 \\ \\text{barn}$), which is much larger than that of hydrogen ($\\sigma_{\\text{coh}}(\\mathrm{H}) \\approx 1.8 \\ \\text{barn}$). Therefore, deuteration not only suppresses the overwhelming incoherent background but often enhances the coherent signal from the phonons themselves. The combined effect is a dramatic improvement in the signal-to-background ratio for the phonon features. Consequently, the phonon dispersions are significantly more visible and can be measured with much greater precision in the deuterated sample compared to the protiated one. This is the fundamental reason why isotopic substitution with deuterium is a ubiquitous and essential technique for studying phonons in hydrogenous materials via INS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{40}$$", "id": "2493221"}, {"introduction": "An inelastic neutron spectrum contains more than just the energies of excitations; the intensities of the scattering peaks carry crucial physical information.
