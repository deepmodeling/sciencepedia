It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution based on fundamental principles of electrochemistry and physics. I will now proceed with the formal derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for the uncompensated resistance, $R_u$, and the corresponding ohmic potential drop, commonly denoted as the $iR$ drop, in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. The derivation will begin from fundamental definitions.\n\nThe relationship between current density $\\vec{j}$, electric field $\\vec{E}$, and electrolyte conductivity $\\kappa$ is given by the point form of Ohm's law for an isotropic medium:\n$$\n\\vec{j} = \\kappa \\vec{E}\n$$\nThe electric field is the negative gradient of the electric potential, $\\phi$: $\\vec{E} = -\\nabla \\phi$. For the specified geometry—a one-dimensional system along the axis perpendicular to the electrode surfaces (let us call this the $z$-axis)—this relationship simplifies to:\n$$\nj_z = -\\kappa \\frac{d\\phi}{dz}\n$$\nwhere $j_z$ is the component of current density along the $z$-axis. The problem states to assume a uniform current density, so $j_z = j = \\text{constant}$.\n\nThe potential drop, $\\Delta \\phi$, across a segment of the electrolyte of length $l$ is found by integrating the electric field over that distance:\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = -\\int_{z_1}^{z_2} \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\int_0^l E_z dz\n$$\nGiven $E_z = j_z / \\kappa = j/\\kappa$, and assuming $\\kappa$ is constant, the integration yields:\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = \\frac{j}{\\kappa} \\int_0^l dz = \\frac{jl}{\\kappa}\n$$\nResistance, $R$, is defined by the macroscopic form of Ohm's law, $\\Delta \\phi = I R$, where $I$ is the total current. The total current is the product of the uniform current density $j$ and the electrode area $A$: $I = jA$.\n\nBy substituting these definitions, we find the resistance of the electrolyte segment:\n$$\nI R = \\frac{(I/A)l}{\\kappa} \\implies R = \\frac{l}{\\kappa A}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental formula for the resistance of a uniform conductor.\n\nThe problem defines the uncompensated resistance, $R_u$, as the resistance of the path between the working electrode (WE) and the reference electrode (RE). The distance for this path is given as $x$. Therefore, the length parameter is $l=x$. The cross-sectional area of the current path is the electrode area $A$.\nThe expression for the uncompensated resistance is thus:\n$$\nR_u = \\frac{x}{\\kappa A}\n$$\nThe $iR$ drop, which we will denote $V_{iR}$, is the potential drop across this uncompensated resistance:\n$$\nV_{iR} = I \\times R_u\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for total current $I=jA$ and uncompensated resistance $R_u=\\frac{x}{\\kappa A}$:\n$$\nV_{iR} = (jA) \\left( \\frac{x}{\\kappa A} \\right)\n$$\nThe area term $A$ cancels, yielding a simplified expression for the $iR$ drop that is independent of the electrode area under the assumption of a uniform parallel-plate field:\n$$\nV_{iR} = \\frac{jx}{\\kappa}\n$$\nTo proceed with the calculation, we must convert all given quantities to SI units.\n-   Conductivity: $\\kappa = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}$\n-   Current density: $j = 300\\,\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}$\n-   Distance from WE to RE: $x = 3.00\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 3.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\nThe other provided values, electrode area $A = 2.00\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ and WE-CE separation $L = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, are not required for the final calculation of $V_{iR}$, a consequence of the symbolic simplification.\n\nSubstituting the SI values into the derived expression:\n$$\nV_{iR} = \\frac{(300\\,\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{5.0\\,\\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}}\n$$\nThe units are consistent: $\\frac{(\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-2}) \\cdot \\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{S} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-1}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-1}}{\\mathrm{S} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-1}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{S}}$. Since a Siemens ($S$) is an inverse Ohm ($\\Omega^{-1}$) and $1\\,\\Omega = 1\\,\\mathrm{V/A}$, then $1\\,\\mathrm{S} = 1\\,\\mathrm{A/V}$. The resulting unit is $\\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{A/V}} = \\mathrm{V}$, which is correct for a potential drop.\n\nPerforming the numerical calculation:\n$$\nV_{iR} = \\frac{900 \\times 10^{-3}}{5.0} \\, \\mathrm{V} = \\frac{0.900}{5.0} \\, \\mathrm{V} = 0.18\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the answer must be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $0.18\\,\\mathrm{V}$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $0.180\\,\\mathrm{V}$. This instruction overrides the standard rule of propagating significant figures from the input data, where the conductivity $\\kappa=5.0\\,\\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}$ has only two significant figures.\n\nThe additional assumptions required for this first-principles calculation are as follows:\n1.  The system geometrty is idealized as two infinite parallel plates, which implies that the electric field and current density are perfectly uniform and one-dimensional. Edge effects are neglected. This is a reasonable approximation if the electrode lateral dimensions are much larger than the separation $L$.\n2.  The reference electrode is an ideal point probe that measures the potential at the position $x$ without physically perturbing the electric field or obstructing the current path.\n3.  The electrolyte conductivity $\\kappa$ is a constant scalar value throughout the solution volume between the working and reference electrodes. This assumes a homogeneous, isotropic medium, with no significant concentration or temperature gradients, which is justifiable for a well-stirred solution not operating under mass-transport-limited conditions.\n4.  The calculation only addresses the ohmic drop in the bulk electrolyte. It neglects other sources of potential drop such as the electrode-electrolyte interface potentials (charge transfer overpotential, double-layer charging) and concentration overpotentials.
