The calculation involves three main steps: determining the distribution of cations on the tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) sites, calculating the total magnetic moment for each sublattice, and finally finding the net moment by considering the antiparallel alignment between the sublattices.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the cation distribution.**\nThe general formula unit for a spinel is $(A)[B_2]O_4$. We need to place the cations $0.7 Ni^{2+}$, $0.3 Zn^{2+}$, and $2.0 Fe^{3+}$ into the A and B sites according to the given preferences.\n\n- The $Zn^{2+}$ ions have a strong preference for the tetrahedral A-sites. Since there are $0.3$ $Zn^{2+}$ ions per formula unit, they will occupy the A-sites.\n- A formula unit has one A-site. The A-site is now partially filled with $0.3$ $Zn^{2+}$. The remaining $1.0 - 0.3 = 0.7$ of the A-site capacity must be filled by another cation. Since $Ni^{2+}$ prefers B-sites, the remaining A-sites are filled by $Fe^{3+}$ ions.\n- Thus, the A-site composition is $(Zn_{0.3}Fe_{0.7})$.\n\n- The $Ni^{2+}$ ions prefer the octahedral B-sites. All $0.7$ $Ni^{2+}$ ions per formula unit will occupy B-sites.\n- A formula unit has two B-sites. The remaining B-site capacity of $2.0 - 0.7 = 1.3$ must be filled by the remaining $Fe^{3+}$ ions.\n- Let's check the $Fe^{3+}$ ion count. We started with $2.0 Fe^{3+}$ ions. We placed $0.7$ in the A-sites, leaving $2.0 - 0.7 = 1.3$ for the B-sites, which exactly matches the remaining B-site capacity.\n- Thus, the B-site composition is $[Ni_{0.7}Fe_{1.3}]$.\n\nCombining these, the full cation distribution per formula unit is $(Zn_{0.3}^{2+}Fe_{0.7}^{3+})[Ni_{0.7}^{2+}Fe_{1.3}^{3+}]O_4$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the magnetic moment of each sublattice.**\nWe are given the spin-only magnetic moments: $\\mu(Ni^{2+})=2.0~\\mu_B$, $\\mu(Fe^{3+})=5.0~\\mu_B$, and $\\mu(Zn^{2+})=0.0~\\mu_B$, where $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton.\n\n- **A-Sublattice Moment ($M_A$)**: The cations on the A-sites are $0.3\\ Zn^{2+}$ and $0.7\\ Fe^{3+}$.\nThe total moment is the sum of the moments of these ions.\n$$M_A = (0.3 \\times \\mu(Zn^{2+})) + (0.7 \\times \\mu(Fe^{3+}))$$\n$$M_A = (0.3 \\times 0.0~\\mu_B) + (0.7 \\times 5.0~\\mu_B) = 0~\\mu_B + 3.5~\\mu_B = 3.5~\\mu_B$$\n\n- **B-Sublattice Moment ($M_B$)**: The cations on the B-sites are $0.7\\ Ni^{2+}$ and $1.3\\ Fe^{3+}$.\nAssuming the moments within a sublattice are ferromagnetically coupled (aligned parallel), the total moment is the sum.\n$$M_B = (0.7 \\times \\mu(Ni^{2+})) + (1.3 \\times \\mu(Fe^{3+}))$$\n$$M_B = (0.7 \\times 2.0~\\mu_B) + (1.3 \\times 5.0~\\mu_B) = 1.4~\\mu_B + 6.5~\\mu_B = 7.9~\\mu_B$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the net magnetic moment.**\nThe material is ferrimagnetic, meaning the A-sublattice moment ($M_A$) and the B-sublattice moment ($M_B$) are aligned antiparallel to each other.
