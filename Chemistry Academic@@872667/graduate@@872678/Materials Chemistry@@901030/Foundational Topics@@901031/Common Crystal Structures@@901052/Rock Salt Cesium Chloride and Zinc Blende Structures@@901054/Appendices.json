Consider three idealized structures built from a Bravais lattice and a two-atom basis:\n- Rock salt (sodium chloride): face-centered cubic (fcc) Bravais lattice with anion at fractional coordinate $\\left(0,0,0\\right)$ and cation at fractional coordinate $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},0,0\\right)$.\n- Cesium chloride: primitive cubic Bravais lattice with anion at fractional coordinate $\\left(0,0,0\\right)$ and cation at fractional coordinate $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$.\n- Zinc blende (zinc sulfide): face-centered cubic (fcc) Bravais lattice with anion at fractional coordinate $\\left(0,0,0\\right)$ and cation at fractional coordinate $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{4},\\tfrac{1}{4},\\tfrac{1}{4}\\right)$.\n\nStarting only from the following fundamental base:\n- A Bravais lattice is a set $\\{\\mathbf{R}\\}$ of translation vectors that tile space by integer linear combinations of primitive translation vectors, and the crystal structure is generated by placing the basis at every $\\mathbf{R}$.\n- A conventional face-centered cubic (fcc) cell has centering translations $\\left(0,0,0\\right)$, $\\left(0,\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$, $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},0,\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$, and $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},0\\right)$, so there are $4$ lattice points per conventional cell; a conventional primitive cubic cell has $1$ lattice point per conventional cell.\n- An atom lying strictly inside a conventional unit cell contributes $1$ to the count within that cell; on a face it contributes $\\tfrac{1}{2}$; on an edge it contributes $\\tfrac{1}{4}$; at a corner it contributes $\\tfrac{1}{8}$, because such sites are shared by $2$, $4$, and $8$ conventional cells, respectively.\n\nDerive $Z$ for each structure by rigorously counting how many cations and anions are contained in a single conventional unit cell, using only the above principles.

No rounding is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem statement is critically examined and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing sufficient axioms to derive the required quantities. The descriptions of the crystal structures, while using a specific choice of basis for rock salt that is less common, are crystallographically correct. The problem requires a rigorous derivation from first principles, which is a legitimate and well-defined task. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the number of formula units, $Z$, per conventional unit cell for three binary ionic structures with stoichiometry $\\mathrm{AB}$. According to the provided definition, with stoichiometric coefficients of $1$ for both cation and anion, $Z$ is equal to the number of cations (or anions) contained within one conventional unit cell. The derivation must use only the stated principles.\n\nThe governing principle is that the crystal structure is generated by placing the basis at every point of the specified Bravais lattice. We must count the total number of anions and cations whose coordinates fall within a single conventional unit cell, applying the specified fractional contributions for atoms at shared locations (corners, faces, edges).\n\n**1. Rock Salt (NaCl) Structure**\n\nThe rock salt structure is defined by a face-centered cubic (fcc) Bravais lattice and a two-atom basis: anion at fractional coordinate $\\mathbf{b}_{A} = (0,0,0)$ and cation at $\\mathbf{b}_{C} = (\\frac{1}{2},0,0)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of anions per conventional unit cell. The anions are located at the sites of the fcc Bravais lattice, as their basis vector is $\\mathbf{b}_{A} = (0,0,0)$. An fcc conventional unit cell has lattice points at its $8$ corners and at the center of its $6$ faces. Using the provided counting rule (Axiom 3):\n- Contribution from $8$ corner anions: $8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1$.\n- Contribution from $6$ face-centered anions: $6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3$.\nThe total number of anions per conventional cell is $N_{A} = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nNext, we determine the number of cations. The cations are located at positions corresponding to each fcc lattice point $\\mathbf{R}$ shifted by the basis vector $\\mathbf{b}_{C} = (\\frac{1}{2},0,0)$. The set of cation positions is $\\{\\mathbf{R} + \\mathbf{b}_{C} | \\mathbf{R} \\in \\text{fcc lattice}\\}$. This forms another fcc lattice, simply displaced from the anion lattice. As such, it must also contain $4$ ions per conventional cell. We verify this by explicit counting.\nWe can identify the cation positions by shifting the anion positions (corners and face centers) by $\\mathbf{b}_{C}$:\n- Shift of corner positions: An atom at a corner, e.g., $(0,0,0)$, is displaced to $(0,0,0) + (\\frac{1}{2},0,0) = (\\frac{1}{2},0,0)$. This is the midpoint of an edge. By symmetry of the cubic lattice, all $12$ edge midpoints must be translationally equivalent sites for cations. For example, the edge midpoint $(0,\\frac{1}{2},0)$ is generated from the fcc lattice point $\\mathbf{R} = (-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0)$ shifted by $\\mathbf{b}_{C}$, plus a lattice translation of $(1,0,0)$: $(-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0) + (\\frac{1}{2},0,0) + (1,0,0) = (1, \\frac{1}{2}, 0)$, which is equivalent to $(0,\\frac{1}{2},0)$. The $12$ edges of the conventional cell are each shared by $4$ cells. Contribution from cations on edges: $12 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 3$.\n- Shift of face-center positions: An atom at a face center, e.g., $(0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$, is displaced to $(0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2},0,0) = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$. This position is the body center of the conventional cell and is not shared. Contribution from the body-centered cation: $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\nThe total number of cations per conventional cell is $N_{C} = 3 + 1 = 4$.\nSince $N_{A} = N_{C} = 4$, the number of formula units is $Z_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} = 4$.\n\n**2. Cesium Chloride (CsCl) Structure**\n\nThe cesium chloride structure is defined by a primitive cubic Bravais lattice and a two-atom basis: anion at $\\mathbf{b}_{A} = (0,0,0)$ and cation at $\\mathbf{b}_{C} = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$.\n\nFirst, we count the anions. They are located at the sites of the primitive cubic lattice, which are the $8$ corners of the conventional cubic cell.\n- Contribution from $8$ corner anions: $8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1$.\nTotal number of anions per conventional cell is $N_{A} = 1$.\n\nNext, we count the cations. Their positions are generated by shifting each lattice point $\\mathbf{R}$ by $\\mathbf{b}_{C}$. For the lattice point at $\\mathbf{R}=(0,0,0)$, the cation is at $(0,0,0) + (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$. This is the body-center position, which is entirely contained within the cell.\n- Contribution from the body-centered cation: $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\nAny other lattice point, e.g., $\\mathbf{R}=(1,0,0)$, generates a cation at $(1,0,0) + (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) = (\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$, which is the body center of an adjacent cell. Thus, there is only one cation per conventional cell.\nTotal number of cations per conventional cell is $N_{C} = 1$.\nSince $N_{A} = N_{C} = 1$, the number of formula units is $Z_{\\mathrm{CsCl}} = 1$.\n\n**3. Zinc Blende (ZnS) Structure**\n\nThe zinc blende structure is defined by an fcc Bravais lattice and a two-atom basis: anion at $\\mathbf{b}_{A} = (0,0,0)$ and cation at $\\mathbf{b}_{C} = (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$.\n\nFirst, we count the anions. As in the rock salt case, the anions are on an fcc lattice.\n- Contribution from $8$ corner anions: $8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1$.\n- Contribution from $6$ face-centered anions: $6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3$.\nTotal number of anions per conventional cell is $N_{A} = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nNext, we count the cations. Their positions are at $\\{\\mathbf{R} + \\mathbf{b}_{C} | \\mathbf{R} \\in \\text{fcc lattice}\\}$. The problem states there are $4$ lattice points per conventional fcc cell, with representative fractional coordinates $(0,0,0)$, $(0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$, $(\\frac{1}{2},0,\\frac{1}{2})$, and $(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0)$. We add the cation basis vector $\\mathbf{b}_{C}$ to each of these to find the locations of the cations within one cell:\n- $\\mathbf{R}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_{C} = (0,0,0) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$.\n- $\\mathbf{R}_2 + \\mathbf{b}_{C} = (0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$.\n- $\\mathbf{R}_3 + \\mathbf{b}_{C} = (\\frac{1}{2},0,\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$.\n- $\\mathbf{R}_4 + \\mathbf{b}_{C} = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$.\nAll four of these resulting coordinates have components strictly between $0$ and $1$. Therefore, all four cations lie entirely inside the conventional unit cell. Each contributes $1$ to the count.\nTotal number of cations per conventional cell is $N_{C} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$.\nSince $N_{A} = N_{C} = 4$, the number of formula units is $Z_{\\mathrm{ZnS}} = 4$.\n\nCombining the results, the values of $Z$ for rock salt, cesium chloride, and zinc blende are $4$, $1$, and $4$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4  1  4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2518413"}, {"introduction": "While we can describe crystal structures theoretically, identifying them in the laboratory requires experimental techniques, with X-ray diffraction (XRD) being paramount.

Therefore, the presence of a strong $(100)$ peak at the largest $d$ (smallest $2\\theta$) is diagnostic of the cesium chloride structure, whereas its absence together with the $(111)$ onset is diagnostic of the rock salt structure. Even when both classes (all even and all odd) are present, the relative intensities differ between the two structures through $F(hkl)$, but the most robust fingerprint for phase identification is the allowed-index sequence, i.e., the pattern of absences and the corresponding integer values of $a^{2}/d^{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}\na  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}  \\frac{a}{2}  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{5}}  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}  \\frac{a}{2}  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{8}}  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{11}}  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{12}}\n\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2518389"}, {"introduction": "A crystal structure is not merely a static geometric arrangement; its existence depends on its ability to remain stable against mechanical disturbances.

This gives the third stability condition:\n$$\nC_{11} - C_{12}  0\n$$\nThis condition ensures stability against a shear strain on a $\\{110\\}$ plane in a $\\langle1\\overline{1}0\\rangle$ direction.\n\nIn summary, the so-called Born stability criteria for a cubic crystal are that all eigenvalues of the stiffness matrix must be positive:\n1. $C_{44}  0$\n2. $C_{11} + 2C_{12}  0$\n3. $C_{11} - C_{12}  0$\n\nNow we apply these conditions to the given elastic constants for $NaCl$:\n- $C_{11} = 46.8$ GPa\n- $C_{12} = 19.2$ GPa\n- $C_{44} = 12.4$ GPa\n\nWe evaluate the three quantities that must be positive:\n1. $C_{44} = 12.4$ GPa. Since $12.4  0$, this condition is satisfied.\n2. $C_{11} + 2C_{12} = 46.8 + 2(19.2) = 46.8 + 38.4 = 85.2$ GPa. Since $85.2  0$, this condition is satisfied.\n3. $C_{11} - C_{12} = 46.8 - 19.2 = 27.6$ GPa. Since $27.6  0$, this condition is satisfied.\n\nAll three stability criteria are fulfilled. Therefore, the material with these constants is mechanically stable.\n\nThe problem defines a stability margin $S$ as the minimum of these three quantities:\n$$\nS \\equiv \\min\\{\\,C_{11} - C_{12},\\; C_{11} + 2 C_{12},\\; C_{44}\\,\\}\n$$\nMechanical stability requires all three arguments of the minimum function to be positive, which implies that $S$ must be positive.\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$\nS = \\min\\{27.6, 85.2, 12.4\\} \\text{ GPa}\n$$\nThe minimum of these values is $12.4$.\n$$\nS = 12.4 \\text{ GPa}\n$$\nThe value of $S$ is positive, which confirms that the material is mechanically stable. The problem requests the answer rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nS = 12.40 \\text{ GPa}\n$$\nThe calculation is complete. The stability conditions have been derived and applied, and the stability margin $S$ has been computed.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{12.40}\n$$", "id": "2518396"}]}
