It represents a standard exercise in applying calculus to fundamental concepts of interatomic potentials in materials physics. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe pairwise potential energy $U(r)$ between two atoms is given by the generalized Mie potential:\n$$U(r) = A r^{-n} - B r^{-m}$$\nwith the given constraints $A>0$, $B>0$, and $n>m>0$. The first term $A r^{-n}$ represents a short-range repulsive interaction, while the second term $-B r^{-m}$ represents a longer-range attractive interaction. The condition $n>m$ ensures that repulsion dominates at very small separations ($r \\to 0$) and attraction dominates at larger separations, leading to a stable potential minimum.\n\nFirst, we must find the first and second derivatives of the potential $U(r)$ with respect to the interatomic distance $r$.\nThe first derivative is:\n$$U'(r) = \\frac{dU}{dr} = -n A r^{-n-1} - (-m) B r^{-m-1} = -n A r^{-n-1} + m B r^{-m-1}$$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$U''(r) = \\frac{d^2U}{dr^2} = -n(-n-1) A r^{-n-2} + m(-m-1) B r^{-m-2} = n(n+1) A r^{-n-2} - m(m+1) B r^{-m-2}$$\n\nThe equilibrium bond length, $r_0$, is found at the minimum of the potential energy curve. The condition for a potential minimum is that the first derivative is zero, $U'(r_0) = 0$, and the second derivative is positive, $U''(r_0) > 0$.\nSetting $U'(r_0) = 0$:\n$$-n A r_0^{-n-1} + m B r_0^{-m-1} = 0$$\n$$m B r_0^{-m-1} = n A r_0^{-n-1}$$\nTo solve for $r_0$, we can rearrange the equation. Assuming $r_0 \\neq 0$, we can multiply by $r_0^{n+1}$:\n$$m B r_0^{n-m} = n A$$\n$$r_0^{n-m} = \\frac{n A}{m B}$$\nThis gives the expression for the equilibrium bond length:\n$$r_0 = \\left(\\frac{n A}{m B}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n-m}}$$\n\nTo confirm that this corresponds to a stable minimum, we must check the sign of $U''(r_0)$. From the equilibrium condition, we can express $B$ in terms of $A$: $m B = n A r_0^{-(n-m)}$. Substituting this into the expression for $U''(r)$:\n$$U''(r_0) = n(n+1) A r_0^{-n-2} - (m+1) (m B) r_0^{-m-2}$$\n$$U''(r_0) = n(n+1) A r_0^{-n-2} - (m+1) (n A r_0^{-(n-m)}) r_0^{-m-2}$$\n$$U''(r_0) = n(n+1) A r_0^{-n-2} - n(m+1) A r_0^{-n-m-m-2} = n(n+1) A r_0^{-n-2} - n(m+1) A r_0^{-n-2}$$\n$$U''(r_0) = A n r_0^{-n-2} \\left[ (n+1) - (m+1) \\right]$$\n$$U''(r_0) = A n (n-m) r_0^{-n-2}$$\nSince $A>0$, $n>0$, $r_0>0$, and it is given that $n>m$, the term $(n-m)$ is positive. Therefore, $U''(r_0) > 0$, confirming that $r_0$ corresponds to a stable equilibrium position.\n\nNext, we derive the binding energy, $D$, which is the depth of the potential well, defined as $D \\equiv |U(r_0)|$. Since we have found a stable minimum, $U(r_0)$ will be negative, so $D = -U(r_0)$.\n$$U(r_0) = A r_0^{-n} - B r_0^{-m}$$\nWe can simplify this expression by using the equilibrium condition $n A r_0^{-n} = m B r_0^{-m}$, which gives $A r_0^{-n} = \\frac{m}{n} B r_0^{-m}$.\nSubstituting this into the potential energy expression:\n$$U(r_0) = \\left(\\frac{m}{n} B r_0^{-m}\\right) - B r_0^{-m} = B r_0^{-m} \\left(\\frac{m}{n} - 1\\right) = -B r_0^{-m} \\left(\\frac{n-m}{n}\\right)$$\nThe binding energy $D$ is therefore:\n$$D = -U(r_0) = B \\left(\\frac{n-m}{n}\\right) r_0^{-m}$$\nTo express $D$ solely in terms of the initial parameters $A$, $B$, $n$, and $m$, we substitute the expression for $r_0$:\n$$D = B \\left(\\frac{n-m}{n}\\right) \\left[ \\left(\\frac{n A}{m B}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n-m}} \\right]^{-m} = B \\left(\\frac{n-m}{n}\\right) \\left(\\frac{n A}{m B}\\right)^{-\\frac{m}{n-m}}$$\n\nFinally, we derive the dimensionless stiffness index $S(n, m)$, defined as:\n$$S(n,m) \\equiv \\frac{r_0^2 U''(r_0)}{|U(r_0)|} = \\frac{r_0^2 U''(r_0)}{D}$$\nWe have already derived expressions for the numerator and the denominator.\nNumerator: $r_0^2 U''(r_0) = r_0^2 \\left( A n (n-m) r_0^{-n-2} \\right) = A n (n-m) r_0^{-n}$.\nDenominator: $D = -U(r_0)$. Let us use an alternative form for $U(r_0)$ by substituting $B r_0^{-m} = \\frac{n}{m} A r_0^{-n}$:\n$$U(r_0) = A r_0^{-n} - \\left(\\frac{n}{m} A r_0^{-n}\\right) = A r_0^{-n} \\left(1 - \\frac{n}{m}\\right) = -A r_0^{-n} \\left(\\frac{n-m}{m}\\right)$$\nSo, the denominator is $D = A r_0^{-n} \\left(\\frac{n-m}{m}\\right)$.\nNow, we compute the ratio for $S(n,m)$:\n$$S(n,m) = \\frac{A n (n-m) r_0^{-n}}{A r_0^{-n} \\left(\\frac{n-m}{m}\\right)}$$\nThe terms $A$, $r_0^{-n}$, and $(n-m)$ cancel out, provided $n \\neq m$.\n$$S(n,m) = \\frac{n}{\\frac{1}{m}} = nm$$\nThis remarkably simple result provides insight into the nature of the bond. The index $S$ is a measure of the curvature of the potential well relative to its depth. A larger value of $S$ implies a \"sharper\" or \"narrower\" potential well for a given binding energy, which corresponds to a bond that is intrinsically stiffer.\n\nThe result $S(n,m) = nm$ shows that the intrinsic stiffness increases with both the repulsive exponent $n$ and the attractive exponent $m$. Increasing $n$ makes the repulsive wall steeper. Increasing $m$ makes the attractive force fall off more rapidly with distance, effectively making the interaction more short-ranged. Both effects contribute to a narrowing of the potential well, thus increasing the relative stiffness $S$.\nThis can be used to rationalize differences between bonding types.\n- **Primary bonds** like covalent bonds are highly directional and short-ranged, which in this model would correspond to large values for both $n$ and $m$, leading to a large $S$. This signifies a very sharp and well-defined potential minimum.\n- **Secondary bonds** like van der Waals forces are weaker and longer-ranged. The attractive part arises from induced dipoles, which typically has an $r^{-6}$ dependence, so $m=6$. The repulsive part is often modeled with $n=12$. This gives $S = 12 \\times 6 = 72$.\n- An **ionic bond** has a long-range coulombic attraction, $r^{-1}$, so $m=1$. The repulsive exponent $n$ is typically around $9$-$12$. For $n=9$, $m=1$, we get $S = 9 \\times 1 = 9$.\nThe smaller value of $S$ for the ionic bond model compared to the van der Waals model does not mean the ionic bond is weaker; to the contrary, its absolute stiffness $U''(r_0)$ and binding energy $D$ are much larger. It means that the ionic potential well is very broad relative to its depth due to the long-range $1/r$ nature of the Coulomb interaction. In contrast, the shorter-range van der Waals interaction ($1/r^6$) results in a comparatively narrower well, hence a larger value of the dimensionless index $S$. Thus, the index $S=nm$ correctly quantifies the intrinsic \"sharpness\" of the potential well as determined by the exponents of repulsion and attraction.\n\nThe final expressions for $r_0$, $D$, and $S(n,m)$ are collected for the final answer.\n$$r_0 = \\left(\\frac{nA}{mB}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n-m}}$$\n$$D = B \\left(\\frac{n-m}{n}\\right) \\left(\\frac{nA}{mB}\\right)^{-\\frac{m}{n-m}}$$\n$$S(n,m) = nm$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{nA}{mB}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n-m}} & B\\left(\\frac{n-m}{n}\\right)\\left(\\frac{nA}{mB}\\right)^{-\\frac{m}{n-m}} & nm \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2515757"}, {"introduction": "While theoretical models provide insight, the ultimate measure of a solid's stability is its experimentally determined cohesive energy.

We shall proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe fundamental task is to calculate the stabilization energy per ion pair in a sodium chloride ($NaCl$) crystal arising from ionic polarization. This energy is a secondary contribution to the lattice energy, supplementing the primary Madelung (Coulomb) energy.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the energy of an induced dipole. The problem models each ion as a harmonic core-shell system. The potential energy stored in the oscillator due to a displacement $\\mathbf{x}$ of the shell relative to the core is $U_{osc} = \\frac{1}{2} k |\\mathbf{x}|^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant. An external electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ exerts a force $\\mathbf{F}_{elec} = q_{sh} \\mathbf{E}$ on the shell (with charge $q_{sh}$). At equilibrium, this force is balanced by the restoring spring force $\\mathbf{F}_{res} = -k\\mathbf{x}$. The equilibrium displacement is thus $\\mathbf{x}_{eq} = \\frac{q_{sh}}{k}\\mathbf{E}$.\n\nThe induced electric dipole moment is defined as $\\mathbf{p} = q_{sh}\\mathbf{x}_{eq}$, which gives $\\mathbf{p} = \\frac{q_{sh}^2}{k}\\mathbf{E}$. By definition, the polarizability $\\alpha$ relates the induced dipole moment to the electric field via $\\mathbf{p} = \\alpha\\mathbf{E}$. Therefore, we identify the polarizability as $\\alpha = \\frac{q_{sh}^2}{k}$.\n\nThe total change in potential energy of the system when the field is applied consists of two parts: the work done by the field on the shell, and the change in the internal energy of the oscillator. The potential energy of the induced dipole in the field is $U_{field} = -\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = -\\alpha |\\mathbf{E}|^2$. The energy stored in the oscillator is $U_{osc} = \\frac{1}{2} k |\\mathbf{x}_{eq}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k \\left| \\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{q_{sh}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k \\frac{\\alpha^2|\\mathbf{E}|^2}{q_{sh}^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha|\\mathbf{E}|^2$, using our expression for $\\alpha$.\n\nThe total polarization energy $U_{pol}$ is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$U_{pol} = U_{osc} + U_{field} = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha |\\mathbf{E}|^2 - \\alpha |\\mathbf{E}|^2 = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha |\\mathbf{E}|^2$$\nThis stabilization energy is the foundation of our calculation.\n\nNext, we apply this to the $NaCl$ crystal. We need to find the polarization energy per ion pair ($Na^+$, $Cl^-$). The problem specifies that we consider only the electric field from the $z=6$ nearest neighbors and that we sum the polarization energies from each neighbor interaction independently. This approximation means we calculate the energy contribution from each neighbor's field as if it were acting alone, and then sum these energies. This avoids the vector cancellation of fields that would occur at a site of high symmetry.\n\nLet us calculate the total polarization energy for the crystal, $U_{total\\_pol}$, and then divide by the number of ion pairs, $N$, to find the energy per pair, $U_{pair}$.

For nearest neighbors in $NaCl$, the distance is $r_0$ and the charge magnitude is $e$. The magnitude of the field produced by any nearest neighbor is therefore:\n$$E_{NN} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{e}{r_0^2}$$\nEach ion has $z=6$ nearest neighbors.
