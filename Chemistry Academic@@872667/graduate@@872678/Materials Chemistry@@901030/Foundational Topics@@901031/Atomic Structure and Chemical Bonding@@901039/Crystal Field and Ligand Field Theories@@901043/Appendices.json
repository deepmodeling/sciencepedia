Adopt the usual ligand field picture: the five metal $d$ orbitals split into a lower-energy triply degenerate $t_{2g}$ set and a higher-energy doubly degenerate $e_{g}$ set. Take the spherical (barycentric) average energy of the $d$ manifold as zero. The octahedral splitting parameter is $\\Delta_{o}$, defined as the energy separation between the $e_{g}$ and $t_{2g}$ levels. The Ligand Field Stabilization Energy (LFSE) is defined here as the stabilization due solely to the redistribution of the $d$-electron density among the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ levels relative to the barycenter, neglecting all interelectronic repulsion and pairing energies. Use the following physical facts as your starting point:\n- The $t_{2g}$ set has degeneracy $3$ and the $e_{g}$ set has degeneracy $2$.\n- The trace (barycenter) condition requires that the degeneracy-weighted mean energy of the split levels equals the unsplit barycenter.\n- The Pauli exclusion principle and Hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity govern electron placement.\nFrom this base, first deduce the energies of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ levels relative to the barycenter in terms of $\\Delta_{o}$. Then, for each $n$ from $0$ to $10$, compute the LFSE for both the weak-field (high-spin) and strong-field (low-spin) electron configurations.

It represents a standard, fundamental exercise in ligand field theory. We proceed to the solution.\n\nFirst, we must determine the energies of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals relative to the barycenter, which is set to an energy of $0$. Let these energies be $E(t_{2g})$ and $E(e_g)$, respectively. The problem provides two critical conditions.\n\n1.  The energy separation between the levels is the octahedral splitting parameter, $\\Delta_{o}$:\n    $$E(e_g) - E(t_{2g}) = \\Delta_{o}$$\n2.  The barycenter condition requires that the degeneracy-weighted mean energy of the split levels remains at the energy of the unsplit manifold, which is $0$. Given the degeneracies $d_{t_{2g}}=3$ and $d_{e_g}=2$, this condition is expressed as:\n    $$d_{t_{2g}}E(t_{2g}) + d_{e_g}E(e_g) = 3 E(t_{2g}) + 2 E(e_g) = 0$$\n\nWe now have a system of $2$ linear equations for the $2$ unknowns, $E(t_{2g})$ and $E(e_g)$. From the first equation, we can express $E(e_g)$ in terms of $E(t_{2g})$:\n$$E(e_g) = E(t_{2g}) + \\Delta_{o}$$\nSubstituting this expression into the second equation yields:\n$$3 E(t_{2g}) + 2 (E(t_{2g)} + \\Delta_{o}) = 0$$\n$$5 E(t_{2g}) + 2 \\Delta_{o} = 0$$\nSolving for $E(t_{2g})$ gives:\n$$E(t_{2g}) = -\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o}$$\nSubstituting this result back to find $E(e_g)$:\n$$E(e_g) = -\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o} + \\Delta_{o} = +\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{o}$$\nThus, the $t_{2g}$ orbitals are stabilized by $\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o}$ and the $e_g$ orbitals are destabilized by $\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{o}$ relative to the barycenter.\n\nNext, we establish the formula for the Ligand Field Stabilization Energy (LFSE). For an electronic configuration $(t_{2g})^{n_{t_{2g}}} (e_g)^{n_{e_g}}$, where $n_{t_{2g}}$ and $n_{e_g}$ are the electron occupancies of the respective levels, the LFSE is defined as:\n$$\\text{LFSE} = n_{t_{2g}} E(t_{2g}) + n_{e_g} E(e_g) = n_{t_{2g}}\\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right) + n_{e_g}\\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right)$$\nThe problem requires the dimensionless quantity $\\text{LFSE}/\\Delta_{o}$, which is:\n$$\\frac{\\text{LFSE}}{\\Delta_{o}} = -\\frac{2}{5} n_{t_{2g}} + \\frac{3}{5} n_{e_g}$$\nWe will now apply this formula for each electron count $n$ from $0$ to $10$ for both high-spin and low-spin cases.\n\n**High-Spin (Weak-Field) Configurations**\nIn the high-spin case, electrons occupy orbitals to maximize total spin multiplicity (Hund's rule).

The value of $\\Delta_o$ is entirely fixed by the LFT model and the observed transitions. The AOM parameters would be determined in a subsequent step, if required, by solving the equation $\\Delta_o = 6e_{\\sigma} - 4e_{\\pi}$ simultaneously with $e_{\\pi} = r e_{\\sigma}$. However, this is not needed to compute the requested quantity.\n\nThe final task is to compute the absolute deviation between the model-inferred $\\Delta_o$ and the independently measured value $\\Delta_o^{(\\mathrm{exp})}$:\n$$ d = |\\Delta_o - \\Delta_o^{(\\mathrm{exp})}| $$\nWe will now apply this procedure to each test case.\n\nCase (1):\nGiven: $\\nu_1 = 7500\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, $\\nu_2 = 15700\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, $r = 1/6$, $\\Delta_o^{(\\mathrm{exp})} = 9500\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\nFirst, we compute the model-inferred $\\Delta_o$:\n$$ \\Delta_o = 3(15700) - 5(7500) = 47100 - 37500 = 9600\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}} $$\nNext, we compute the absolute deviation:\n$$ d_1 = |9600 - 9500| = 100\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}} $$\n\nCase (2):\nGiven: $\\nu_1 = 9200\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, $\\nu_2 = 19000\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, $r = -0.11764705882352941$, $\\Delta_o^{(\\mathrm{exp})} = 11250\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\nWe compute the model-inferred $\\Delta_o$:\n$$ \\Delta_o = 3(19000) - 5(9200) = 57000 - 46000 = 11000\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}} $$\nNext, we compute the absolute deviation:\n$$ d_2 = |11000 - 11250| = 250\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}} $$\n\nCase (3):\nGiven: $\\nu_1 = 7500\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, $\\nu_2 = 15500\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, $r = 0$, $\\Delta_o^{(\\mathrm{exp})} = 9000\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\nWe compute the model-inferred $\\Delta_o$:\n$$ \\Delta_o = 3(15500) - 5(7500) = 46500 - 37500 = 9000\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}} $$\nNext, we compute the absolute deviation:\n$$ d_3 = |9000 - 9000| = 0\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}} $$\n\nThe calculated absolute deviations are $100\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, $250\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, and $0\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ for the three cases, respectively.
