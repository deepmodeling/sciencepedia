Units are not applicable.", "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution under the standard conventions of applied group theory. Therefore, the problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the construction of symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALCs) for the three hydrogen $1s$ orbitals in ammonia, $\\text{NH}_{3}$, which belongs to the $C_{3v}$ point group. The final goal is to find the normalized coefficient vector for the totally symmetric SALC. The designated basis set is $\\{\\phi_{a}, \\phi_{b}, \\phi_{c}\\}$, representing the three H $1s$ orbitals.\n\nFirst, we require the character table for the $C_{3v}$ point group. The group has three classes of symmetry operations: the identity $E$, two rotations $C_3$ (clockwise and counterclockwise), and three vertical mirror planes $\\sigma_v$. The order of the group is $h=6$. The character table is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc|l}\nC_{3v} & E & 2C_3 & 3\\sigma_v & \\\\\n\\hline\nA_1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & z, z^2, x^2+y^2 \\\\\nA_2 & 1 & 1 & -1 & R_z \\\\\nE & 2 & -1 & 0 & (x, y), (xz, yz), (x^2-y^2, xy) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe first step is to determine the reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{H}$, generated by the basis of the three hydrogen $1s$ orbitals, $\\{\\phi_{a}, \\phi_{b}, \\phi_{c}\\}$. The character of a representation for a given symmetry operation is the trace of the transformation matrix, which simplifies to the number of basis functions that are left unchanged (not shifted to a new position) by that operation.\n\nThe action of the symmetry operations on the basis orbitals is as follows:\n1.  $\\hat{E}$: The identity operation leaves all three orbitals in place. $\\hat{E}(\\phi_a, \\phi_b, \\phi_c) = (\\phi_a, \\phi_b, \\phi_c)$. The number of unshifted orbitals is $3$. Thus, $\\chi_{H}(E) = 3$.\n2.  $\\hat{C}_3$: The rotation by $2\\pi/3$ permutes the orbitals cyclically, for instance, $\\phi_a \\rightarrow \\phi_b \\rightarrow \\phi_c \\rightarrow \\phi_a$. No orbital is left in its original position. The number of unshifted orbitals is $0$. Thus, $\\chi_{H}(C_3) = 0$.\n3.  $\\hat{\\sigma}_v$: Each of the three vertical mirror planes contains the nitrogen atom and one hydrogen atom, and bisects the angle between the other two hydrogens. For a plane containing H$_a$, the orbital $\\phi_a$ is unshifted, while $\\phi_b$ and $\\phi_c$ are interchanged. Therefore, for any of the $\\sigma_v$ operations, exactly one H $1s$ orbital is left unshifted. The number of unshifted orbitals is $1$. Thus, $\\chi_{H}(\\sigma_v) = 1$.\n\nThe character set for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{H}$ is therefore $(3, 0, 1)$.\n\nNext, we decompose $\\Gamma_{H}$ into its constituent irreducible representations (irreps). The number of times an irrep $\\Gamma_i$ is contained in $\\Gamma_H$ is given by the formula:\n$$ n_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{R} g_R \\cdot \\chi_i(R) \\cdot \\chi_H(R) $$\nwhere $h$ is the order of the group, $g_R$ is the number of operations in the class of $R$, $\\chi_i(R)$ is the character of the irrep $\\Gamma_i$ for the operation class $R$, and $\\chi_H(R)$ is the character of the reducible representation $\\Gamma_H$ for the class $R$.\n\nFor $A_1$:\n$$ n_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{6} [ (1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3) + (2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0) + (3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1) ] = \\frac{1}{6} [3 + 0 + 3] = 1 $$\nFor $A_2$:\n$$ n_{A_2} = \\frac{1}{6} [ (1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3) + (2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0) + (3 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 1) ] = \\frac{1}{6} [3 + 0 - 3] = 0 $$\nFor $E$:\n$$ n_{E} = \\frac{1}{6} [ (1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3) + (2 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 0) + (3 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 1) ] = \\frac{1}{6} [6 + 0 + 0] = 1 $$\nThe decomposition is $\\Gamma_{H} = A_1 + E$. This indicates that the three H $1s$ orbitals combine to form one SALC of $A_1$ symmetry (the totally symmetric one) and a degenerate pair of SALCs of $E$ symmetry.\n\nThe problem asks for the coefficients of the totally symmetric SALC. We will use the projection operator method to generate this SALC. The projection operator $\\hat{P}^{(i)}$ for an irrep $\\Gamma_i$ is given by:\n$$ \\hat{P}^{(i)} \\propto \\sum_{R} \\chi_i(R) \\hat{R} $$\nWe apply this operator to one of the basis functions, for example, $\\phi_a$. For the totally symmetric irrep $A_1$, the characters are all $1$.\nThe set of six operations in the group is $\\{E, C_3, C_3^2, \\sigma_{v(a)}, \\sigma_{v(b)}, \\sigma_{v(c)}\\}$. We define the actions of these operators on the chosen basis function $\\phi_a$:\n- $\\hat{E}(\\phi_a) = \\phi_a$\n- $\\hat{C}_3(\\phi_a) = \\phi_b$\n- $\\hat{C}_3^2(\\phi_a) = \\phi_c$\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(a)}(\\phi_a) = \\phi_a$ (where $\\sigma_{v(a)}$ is the plane containing H$_a$)\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(b)}(\\phi_a) = \\phi_c$ (where $\\sigma_{v(b)}$ is the plane containing H$_b$)\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(c)}(\\phi_a) = \\phi_b$ (where $\\sigma_{v(c)}$ is the plane containing H$_c$)\n\nApplying the projector for $A_1$ symmetry:\n$$ \\Psi'_{A_1} = \\hat{P}^{(A_1)} \\phi_a \\propto \\sum_{R} \\chi_{A_1}(R) \\hat{R}(\\phi_a) $$\n$$ \\Psi'_{A_1} \\propto (1)\\hat{E}(\\phi_a) + (1)\\hat{C}_3(\\phi_a) + (1)\\hat{C}_3^2(\\phi_a) + (1)\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(a)}(\\phi_a) + (1)\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(b)}(\\phi_a) + (1)\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(c)}(\\phi_a) $$\n$$ \\Psi'_{A_1} \\propto \\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c + \\phi_a + \\phi_c + \\phi_b = 2\\phi_a + 2\\phi_b + 2\\phi_c $$\nDropping the common factor of $2$, the unnormalized SALC for $A_1$ symmetry is:\n$$ \\Psi'_{A_1} = \\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c $$\nFinally, we must normalize this SALC. The normalization condition is $\\langle \\Psi_{A_1} | \\Psi_{A_1} \\rangle = 1$. Let $N$ be the normalization constant, such that $\\Psi_{A_1} = N \\Psi'_{A_1}$.\n$$ \\langle N(\\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c) | N(\\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c) \\rangle = 1 $$\n$$ N^2 \\langle \\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c | \\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c \\rangle = 1 $$\nAssuming the atomic orbitals form an orthonormal set, i.e., $\\langle \\phi_i | \\phi_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$ (where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta), the inner product becomes:\n$$ \\langle \\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c | \\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c \\rangle = \\langle \\phi_a | \\phi_a \\rangle + \\langle \\phi_b | \\phi_b \\rangle + \\langle \\phi_c | \\phi_c \\rangle = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 $$\nSo, $N^2 \\cdot 3 = 1$, which gives $N = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nThe normalized totally symmetric SALC is:\n$$ \\Psi_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(\\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\phi_a + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\phi_b + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\phi_c $$\nThis function is expressed as a linear combination of the basis functions $(\\phi_a, \\phi_b, \\phi_c)$.

The gross electron population on an atom is the sum of electron populations in the atomic orbitals centered on it. In the zero-overlap approximation, the population on atom $A$ (Hydrogen) from an MO $\\Psi$ occupied by $n$ electrons is $n c_{A}^{2}$. The problem states the bonding MO is occupied by $n=2$ electrons.\nThus, the Mulliken gross population on hydrogen is $N_{H} = 2c_{A}^{2}$.\nThe partial charge is defined as $q_{H} = Z_{H} - N_{H}$, where $Z_{H}=1$ is the nuclear charge of hydrogen.\n$$\nq_{H} = 1 - N_{H} = 1 - 2c_{A}^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $c_{A}^{2}$:\n$$\nq_{H} = 1 - 2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{A} - \\alpha_{B}}{\\sqrt{(\\alpha_{A} - \\alpha_{B})^{2} + 4\\beta^{2}}} \\right) \\right] = 1 - \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{A} - \\alpha_{B}}{\\sqrt{(\\alpha_{A} - \\alpha_{B})^{2} + 4\\beta^{2}}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nq_{H} = \\frac{\\alpha_{A} - \\alpha_{B}}{\\sqrt{(\\alpha_{A} - \\alpha_{B})^{2} + 4\\beta^{2}}}\n$$\nThis elegant result allows for a direct calculation.\n\nFor the qualitative prediction of bond polarity, we compare the magnitudes of the squared coefficients. Since $\\alpha_{A} = -13.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\alpha_{B} = -18.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, we have $\\alpha_{A} > \\alpha_{B}$, so $\\alpha_{A} - \\alpha_{B} > 0$. From the expressions for $c_A^2$ and $c_B^2$, it is evident that $c_{B}^{2} > c_{A}^{2}$. This means that the bonding MO has a larger contribution from the fluorine $2p_z$ atomic orbital than from the hydrogen $1s$ atomic orbital. Consequently, the two electrons in the bonding MO have a higher probability density near the fluorine atom. This unequal sharing of electrons results in a polar covalent bond, creating a partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom ($q_H > 0$) and a partial negative charge on the fluorine atom. The bond dipole moment vector points from hydrogen to fluorine, i.e., $\\mathrm{H}^{\\delta+}-\\mathrm{F}^{\\delta-}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $q_{H}$.
