It utilizes a standard, albeit simplified, model in materials chemistry—the radius-ratio rules—and employs standard tabulated data (Shannon radii). The questions are sequential, logical, and address core concepts of crystal chemistry: calculation, prediction, and critical evaluation of the model. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis of magnesium oxide ($\\mathrm{MgO}$) using the hard-sphere ionic model.\n\n(a) First, we are tasked to compute the cation-to-anion radius ratio, which we denote as $\\rho$. The given Shannon effective ionic radii for sixfold coordination ($\\mathrm{CN}=6$) are:\nThe cation radius for magnesium, $r_{c}(\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}; \\mathrm{CN}=6) = 0.72\\ \\text{\\AA}$.\nThe anion radius for oxygen, $r_{a}(\\mathrm{O}^{2-}; \\mathrm{CN}=6) = 1.40\\ \\text{\\AA}$.\n\nThe ratio $\\rho$ is calculated as follows:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{r_{c}}{r_{a}} = \\frac{0.72}{1.40} $$\nThis calculation yields $\\rho \\approx 0.5142857...$. The problem specifies rounding the result to four significant figures.\n$$ \\rho \\approx 0.5143 $$\n\n(b) Second, we must use this ratio to predict the favored coordination number ($\\mathrm{CN}$) for the $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ cation in an oxide lattice. The prediction is based on the geometric stability criteria for a cation fitting into an interstitial site created by a close-packed arrangement of anions. The stability windows for the radius ratio $\\rho$ are derived from purely geometric constraints, where the lower bound of each range corresponds to the cation being in simultaneous contact with all coordinating anions, and these anions are also in contact with each other. The upper bound is the lower bound for the next higher coordination number. The critical ranges are:\n- For tetrahedral coordination ($\\mathrm{CN}=4$): $0.225 \\le \\rho < 0.414$\n- For octahedral coordination ($\\mathrm{CN}=6$): $0.414 \\le \\rho < 0.732$\n- For cubic coordination ($\\mathrm{CN}=8$): $0.732 \\le \\rho < 1.000$\n\nOur calculated ratio is $\\rho \\approx 0.5143$. We must locate this value within the established stability windows. We observe that:\n$$ 0.414 \\le 0.5143 < 0.732 $$\nThis result places the $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ cation squarely within the stability range for octahedral coordination. Therefore, the hard-sphere model predicts that $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ will favor a coordination number of $6$. This is consistent with the known rock-salt crystal structure of $\\mathrm{MgO}$, where both $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ exhibit $\\mathrm{CN}=6$.\n\n(c) Third, we must identify two specific limitations of applying this radius-ratio model with Shannon radii to predict coordination in real oxides.\n\n1.  **The hard-sphere approximation is fundamentally flawed.** Ions are not rigid, incompressible spheres with sharply defined boundaries. They are quantum mechanical entities consisting of a nucleus and a deformable electron cloud. This has two major consequences. First, the effective \"radius\" of an ion is not a fixed property but is influenced by its chemical environment, including the nature of its neighbors. Second, and more importantly, chemical bonding is not purely ionic. Real oxides, including $\\mathrm{MgO}$, exhibit some degree of covalent character in their bonds. Covalency introduces directionality and can stabilize coordination geometries (e.g., tetrahedral coordination for $sp^3$ hybridization) that would be deemed unstable by the simple geometric radius-ratio criterion. The model completely ignores the energetics of covalent bond formation.\n\n2.  **The use of coordination-dependent radii introduces circular reasoning.** The problem provides Shannon radii for $\\mathrm{CN}=6$ to calculate a ratio, which is then used to predict that $\\mathrm{CN}=6$ is the stable coordination. This is a tautological exercise. Shannon radii are empirically derived from a large set of experimentally determined crystal structures. The value for a given ion's radius is explicitly determined for a specific coordination number. A truly predictive model would require a fundamental, coordination-independent definition of ionic size. Furthermore, the radius-ratio model is a purely geometric argument that ignores the total lattice energy of the crystal. The thermodynamically stable structure is the one that minimizes the Gibbs free energy, of which the electrostatic (Madelung) energy is a dominant term. The radius-ratio rules provide a necessary but not sufficient condition for stability and often fail because they neglect the complex interplay of thermodynamic factors that govern crystal structure formation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5143}\n$$", "id": "2476044"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the geometry of a single coordination polyhedron, the way these units connect to form an extended solid dictates the material's overall stoichiometry and properties. This problem focuses on the crucial skill of translating a structural description—in this case, a one-dimensional chain of edge-sharing octahedra—into a precise chemical formula. By methodically accounting for shared and unshared vertices, you will practice the fundamental bookkeeping required to understand the composition of complex inorganic solids [@problem_id:2476058].", "problem": "An extended solid is constructed from a one-dimensional chain of edge-sharing metal–oxygen octahedra, denoted $MO_{6}$. By definition, an $MO_{6}$ octahedron has $6$ oxide vertices coordinated to a single metal $M$, and an edge-sharing link between two octahedra consists of the two octahedra sharing a common edge composed of $2$ oxide ions. In this chain, each $MO_{6}$ octahedron shares exactly $2$ opposite edges with its two nearest neighbors along the chain. There is no corner-sharing or face-sharing between octahedra anywhere in the structure. Assume that each oxide ion located on a shared edge is coordinated to exactly $2$ metal centers (those of the two octahedra that share the edge), and that the remaining oxide ions on an octahedron that are not on shared edges are non-bridging with respect to the $MO_{6}$ network.

No contradictions, missing data, or scientifically unsound premises are present. The problem is well-posed and objective, leading to a unique, derivable solution.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be developed.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the stoichiometric coefficient $x$ in the formula $A_{x} M O_{y}$. This is a two-part process. First, the stoichiometry of the anionic framework, $M O_{y}$, must be determined from the given connectivity. Second, the principle of global charge neutrality must be applied to determine the value of $x$.\n\nPart 1: Determination of the anionic framework stoichiometry $(M O_{y})$\n\nThe formula unit is referenced to a single metal center, $M$. We must count the number of oxide ions associated with one $M$ by considering the contributions from both shared and unshared ions.\n\nAn octahedron is defined by $6$ vertices. In this case, the vertices are oxide ions, so we start with an $MO_{6}$ coordination polyhedron.\n\nThe problem states that each octahedron shares $2$ opposite edges. An edge in a polyhedron connects $2$ vertices. Therefore, the number of vertices (oxide ions) involved in edge-sharing for a single octahedron is $2 \\times 2 = 4$. These are the bridging or shared oxide ions.\n\nThe remaining oxide ions on the octahedron are not involved in sharing with other octahedra in the chain. The number of these non-bridging or terminal oxide ions is the total number of vertices minus the number of shared vertices: $6 - 4 = 2$.\n\nTo determine the formula unit $MO_{y}$, we sum the fractional contributions of each ion.\n1.  Contribution of shared oxide ions: There are $4$ shared oxide ions per octahedron. The problem states that each is coordinated to $2$ metal centers, confirming they are shared between exactly two octahedra. Thus, each shared ion contributes $1/2$ to the formula unit of a single octahedron. The total contribution from shared ions is $4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 2$.\n2.  Contribution of terminal oxide ions: There are $2$ terminal oxide ions per octahedron. These are not shared and belong entirely to one octahedron. Thus, each terminal ion contributes $1$ to the formula unit. The total contribution from terminal ions is $2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\nThe total number of oxide ions, $y$, per metal center $M$ is the sum of these contributions:\n$$y = (\\text{contribution from shared } O) + (\\text{contribution from terminal } O) = 2 + 2 = 4$$\nThus, the stoichiometry of the anionic framework is $MO_{4}$.\n\nThe first sub-task is to find the number of shared oxide ions per formula unit. This corresponds to the total contribution from shared ions to the formula unit, which we calculated as $4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 2$.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the full composition $A_{x} M O_{y}$\n\nWe have determined that $y=4$, so the formula is $A_{x} M O_{4}$. We now apply the principle of charge neutrality, which states that the sum of all oxidation states in a neutral compound must equal zero.\n\nThe oxidation states of the constituent species are given or known:\n- Cation $A$: $A^{+}$, so the charge is $+1$.\n- Metal $M$: The oxidation state is given as $+5$.\n- Oxide ion $O$: The standard oxidation state is $-2$.\n\nThe charge balance equation for the formula unit $A_{x} M O_{4}$ is:\n$$x \\times (\\text{charge of A}) + 1 \\times (\\text{oxidation state of M}) + 4 \\times (\\text{oxidation state of O}) = 0$$\nSubstituting the known values into the equation:\n$$x \\times (+1) + 1 \\times (+5) + 4 \\times (-2) = 0$$\n$$x + 5 - 8 = 0$$\n$$x - 3 = 0$$\nSolving for $x$, we find:\n$$x = 3$$\nThe value of $x$ is an integer, so it is consistent with the requirement for the minimal composition.
