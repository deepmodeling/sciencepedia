Do not attach units to your final boxed answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the linear density $LD_{[100]}$ for a simple cubic (SC) crystal lattice with a single-atom basis. The analysis must be based on fundamental definitions.\n\nFirst, we define the simple cubic Bravais lattice. The lattice points are given by the set of vectors $\\vec{R}$ such that $\\vec{R} = n_1 \\vec{a}_1 + n_2 \\vec{a}_2 + n_3 \\vec{a}_3$, where $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are integers. For a simple cubic lattice with lattice parameter $a$, the primitive lattice vectors can be chosen as a set of orthogonal vectors of length $a$:\n$$ \\vec{a}_1 = a \\hat{x} $$\n$$ \\vec{a}_2 = a \\hat{y} $$\n$$ \\vec{a}_3 = a \\hat{z} $$\nThe problem states there is a single-atom basis at each lattice point. This means the position of every atom in the crystal coincides with a lattice point $\\vec{R}$.\n\nNext, we identify the crystallographic direction $[100]$. This direction is defined by the vector $\\vec{v} = 1 \\cdot \\vec{a}_1 + 0 \\cdot \\vec{a}_2 + 0 \\cdot \\vec{a}_3 = \\vec{a}_1 = a\\hat{x}$. This vector points along the positive x-axis, which is a cube edge of the conventional unit cell.\n\nThe linear density $LD_{[100]}$ is defined as the number of atoms per unit length along a line parallel to the $[100]$ direction. Let us consider the line passing through the origin, which is the x-axis. The atomic centers located on this line correspond to lattice points where $n_2=0$ and $n_3=0$. The positions of these atoms are given by $\\vec{R} = n_1 a \\hat{x}$ for all integers $n_1$. Thus, we have a one-dimensional chain of atoms located at positions $x = \\dots, -2a, -a, 0, a, 2a, \\dots$.\n\nTo calculate the linear density, we follow the instruction to select a minimal translational repeat segment along the $[100]$ direction. The crystal is periodic along this direction, and the shortest translational vector that maps the crystal onto itself is $\\vec{T} = \\vec{a}_1 = a\\hat{x}$. The length of this minimal repeat vector is the repeat length, $L = |\\vec{a}_1| = a$.\n\nWe now need to find the number of distinct atomic centers, $N$, associated with this repeat segment of length $L=a$. Let us consider the segment along the x-axis from $x=0$ to $x=a$. The atomic centers on this segment are at its endpoints: one at $x=0$ and another at $x=a$. To correctly account for the number of atoms per periodic repeat unit, we must avoid double counting. The standard convention in crystallography is to count any atom at the origin of the unit cell (or, in this 1D case, the start of the segment) as belonging to that cell, while any atoms on the other boundaries are considered part of adjacent cells. The atom at $x=a$ is equivalent by translation to the atom at $x=0$ for the next repeat segment. Therefore, the number of distinct atomic centers per repeat segment is $N=1$.\n\nAlternatively, one may consider that an atom at an endpoint of a 1D segment is shared by the two adjacent segments. Each of the two atoms at the ends of the segment from $x=0$ to $x=a$ would then contribute a weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$ to the segment. The total number of atoms within the segment is then $N = (\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2}) = 1$. Both counting methods yield the same result: there is effectively $1$ atom per repeat length $a$.\n\nFinally, the linear density $LD_{[100]}$ is calculated as the ratio of the number of atoms per repeat segment to the length of that segment:\n$$ LD_{[100]} = \\frac{N}{L} $$\nSubstituting the values we found, $N=1$ and $L=a$:\n$$ LD_{[100]} = \\frac{1}{a} $$\nThis is the closed-form symbolic function of $a$ that represents the linear density along the $[100]$ direction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{a}}$$", "id": "2495980"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered linear density, we now extend the concept into two dimensions to explore planar density.

For the $(100)$ plane, the intercepts are $a/1$, $a/0$, and $a/0$. This describes a plane that intercepts the first axis at $a$ and is parallel to the second and third axes. The family of $(100)$ planes are all planes perpendicular to the $\\vec{a}_1$ vector. For simplicity and without loss of generality, we select the plane passing through the origin, which is defined by the equation $x=0$.\n\nThe atoms whose centers lie on this plane are those with coordinates $(x,y,z)$ satisfying $x=0$. In the SC lattice, these correspond to atomic positions $(0, n_2 a, n_3 a)$, where $n_2$ and $n_3$ are integers. These atoms form a two-dimensional square lattice in the $y-z$ plane.\n\nThe problem requires the identification of a primitive surface cell based on in-plane translational symmetry. The two primitive translation vectors that generate this two-dimensional lattice are $\\vec{b}_1 = a\\hat{y}$ and $\\vec{b}_2 = a\\hat{z}$. A primitive cell is a parallelogram constructed from these vectors. A convenient choice for this cell is the square in the $x=0$ plane with vertices at the atomic positions corresponding to the points $(0,0,0)$, $(0,a,0)$, $(0,a,a)$, and $(0,0,a)$.\n\nThe area of this primitive surface cell, $A_{(100)}$, is the area of the square with side length $a$.\n$$A_{(100)} = a \\times a = a^2$$\n\nNext, we must count the number of atoms, $N_{(100)}$, whose centers lie on the plane and are contained within this chosen cell, accounting for sharing. The chosen square cell has an atom at each of its four corners. In a two-dimensional lattice, an atom at a corner of a cell is shared by four adjacent cells. Therefore, the contribution of each corner atom to a single cell is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe total number of atoms per cell is the sum of the contributions from the four corner atoms:\n$$N_{(100)} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1$$\nThis result, one atom per cell, confirms that the chosen cell is indeed a primitive cell for the surface lattice.\n\nThe planar density, $PD$, is defined as the number of atoms centered on the plane per unit area of the plane.

The necessary information, including crystal structure, lattice parameter, and specific definitions for density calculations, is provided. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a rigorous derivation can proceed.\n\nThe crystal structure is Face-Centered Cubic (FCC). The conventional unit cell is a cube of edge length $a$. In this structure, atoms are located at the $8$ corners and the $6$ face centers of the cube. We take the fractional coordinates of the basis atoms to be $(0,0,0)$ for the corners and $(1/2, 1/2, 0)$, $(1/2, 0, 1/2)$, $(0, 1/2, 1/2)$ for the face centers, plus all integer translations.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of five quantities: $LD_{[110]}$, $LD_{[111]}$, $PD_{(100)}$, $PD_{(110)}$, and $PD_{(111)}$. We will derive each one from the provided definitions.\n\n1.  **Linear Density along $[110]$, $LD_{[110]}$**\n    The direction $[110]$ corresponds to a face diagonal of the cubic cell. The definition requires we use the \"shortest translation segment along that direction\". In an FCC lattice, the shortest translation vector connecting two lattice points along the $[110]$ direction is the vector from a corner atom, e.g., at $(0,0,0)$, to an adjacent face-center atom, e.g., at $(a/2, a/2, 0)$.\n    The length of this segment, $L_{[110]}$, is:\n    $$L_{[110]} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{2}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\n    This segment connects two atomic centers, one at its start and one at its end. According to the provided counting rule for a one-dimensional repeat region, an atom at a corner (endpoint) is shared by the two regions meeting at that corner, and thus contributes a fraction of $1/2$. The number of atoms, $N_{[110]}$, associated with this segment is the sum of the contributions from its two endpoints:\n    $$N_{[110]} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$$\n    The linear density is the number of atoms per unit length of this segment:\n    $$LD_{[110]} = \\frac{N_{[110]}}{L_{[110]}} = \\frac{1}{a/\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{a}$$\n\n2.  **Linear Density along $[111]$, $LD_{[111]}$**\n    The direction $[111]$ corresponds to a body diagonal of the cubic cell. The shortest translation segment along this direction connects two equivalent corner atoms, for instance from $(0,0,0)$ to $(a,a,a)$. There are no other FCC lattice points situated on the line between these two points.\n    The length of this segment, $L_{[111]}$, is:\n    $$L_{[111]} = \\sqrt{a^2 + a^2 + a^2} = \\sqrt{3a^2} = a\\sqrt{3}$$\n    This segment connects two atomic centers at its endpoints. Using the same one-dimensional counting rule as before, the number of atoms, $N_{[111]}$, associated with this segment is:\n    $$N_{[111]} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$$\n    The linear density is:\n    $$LD_{[111]} = \\frac{N_{[111]}}{L_{[111]}} = \\frac{1}{a\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\n3.  **Planar Density of $(100)$, $PD_{(100)}$**\n    The $(100)$ plane corresponds to a face of the cubic cell. Let us analyze the plane at $x=0$. The smallest two-dimensional repeat region is a square with side length $a$.\n    The area of this region, $A_{(100)}$, is:\n    $$A_{(100)} = a \\times a = a^2$$\n    This square region contains atoms at its four corners (which are corner atoms of the 3D cube) and one atom at its center (which is a face-center atom of the 3D cube).\n    Using the provided two-dimensional counting rules:\n    - Each of the $4$ corner atoms is shared by $4$ adjacent square regions in the plane, contributing $1/4$ each.\n    - The atom at the center is located strictly inside the region, contributing $1$.\n    The total number of atoms, $N_{(100)}$, in the repeat region is:\n    $$N_{(100)} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$$\n    The planar density is:\n    $$PD_{(100)} = \\frac{N_{(100)}}{A_{(100)}} = \\frac{2}{a^2}$$\n\n4.  **Planar Density of $(110)$, $PD_{(110)}$**\n    The $(110)$ plane is a diagonal plane that cuts through the cube. Let us consider the plane containing the atoms at $(0,0,0)$, $(a,a,0)$, $(0,0,a)$, and $(a,a,a)$. The smallest two-dimensional repeat region is a rectangle with side lengths $a$ (along the $[001]$ direction) and $a\\sqrt{2}$ (along the $[110]$ direction).\n    The area of this region, $A_{(110)}$, is:\n    $$A_{(110)} = a \\times (a\\sqrt{2}) = a^2\\sqrt{2}$$\n    The atoms within this rectangular region are:\n    - $4$ corner atoms (which are corner atoms of the 3D cube).\n    - $2$ atoms on the edges (which are face-center atoms of the 3D cube, at $(a/2, a/2, 0)$ and $(a/2, a/2, a)$). These lie at the midpoints of the longer edges of the rectangle.\n    Using the counting rules:\n    - The $4$ corner atoms are shared by $4$ adjacent rectangular regions, contributing $4 \\times (1/4) = 1$.\n    - The $2$ atoms on the edges are each shared by $2$ adjacent regions, contributing $2 \\times (1/2) = 1$.\n    The total number of atoms, $N_{(110)}$, is:\n    $$N_{(110)} = 1 + 1 = 2$$\n    The planar density is:\n    $$PD_{(110)} = \\frac{N_{(110)}}{A_{(110)}} = \\frac{2}{a^2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{a^2}$$\n\n5.  **Planar Density of $(111)$, $PD_{(111)}$**\n    The $(111)$ plane is a close-packed plane in the FCC structure. The atoms form a hexagonal arrangement. The smallest two-dimensional repeat region (the primitive cell) is a rhombus. The vertices of this rhombus are atom centers. The side length of the rhombus is the nearest-neighbor distance in the FCC lattice, which is $d = a/\\sqrt{2}$. The internal angles of the rhombus are $60^\\circ$ and $120^\\circ$.\n    The area of this rhombus, $A_{(111)}$, is:\n    $$A_{(111)} = d^2 \\sin(60^\\circ) = \\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{a^2}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{a^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$$\n    Since this is a primitive repeat region, it contains exactly one lattice point (atom) by definition. We can verify this with the counting rules: the rhombus has $4$ vertices, and each vertex is shared by $4$ adjacent rhombi in a planar tiling.\n    The number of atoms, $N_{(111)}$, is:\n    $$N_{(111)} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1$$\n    The planar density is:\n    $$PD_{(111)} = \\frac{N_{(111)}}{A_{(111)}} = \\frac{1}{a^2\\sqrt{3}/4} = \\frac{4}{a^2\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation and Units**\nTo evaluate these expressions for $a = 4.00$ $\\text{\\AA}$:\n- For $LD_{[110]} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{a}$, one would substitute $a=4.00$ to get $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4.00}$.
