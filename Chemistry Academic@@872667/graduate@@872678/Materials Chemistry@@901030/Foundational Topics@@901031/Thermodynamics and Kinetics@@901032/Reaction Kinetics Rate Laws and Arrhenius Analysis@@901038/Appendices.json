It is a well-defined, standard problem in quantitative scientific data analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Optimal Procedure**\nThe core of the problem is to choose a regression method that correctly accounts for the stochastic nature of the measurements. The proposed rate law is a nonlinear model:\n$$r = k\\,C_A^{m}\\,C_B^{n}$$\nThe measurement process introduces a multiplicative error:\n$$\\hat r = r\\,\\exp(\\epsilon) = (k\\,C_A^{m}\\,C_B^{n})\\,\\exp(\\epsilon)$$\nwhere $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)$. The variance of the error term $\\epsilon$ is constant.\n\nThis multiplicative error structure results in heteroscedasticity on the original scale of the rate, $r$. The standard deviation of the measurement $\\hat r$ is approximately proportional to the true rate $r$: $\\operatorname{SD}(\\hat r) \\approx \\sigma r$. The problem gives this as $\\approx 0.05\\,r$. Thus, the variance of the measurement, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat r)$, is not constant; it increases with the magnitude of the rate. A regression technique that assumes constant variance (homoscedasticity), such as unweighted least squares, applied to the raw data $(\\hat r, C_A, C_B)$ would be statistically inappropriate.\n\nTo address this, we can transform the model to a space where the error properties are simpler. Taking the natural logarithm of the measurement equation yields:\n$$\\ln(\\hat r) = \\ln(k\\,C_A^{m}\\,C_B^{n}) + \\ln(\\exp(\\epsilon))$$\n$$\\ln(\\hat r) = \\ln k + m \\ln C_A + n \\ln C_B + \\epsilon$$\nThis transformed equation is a linear model with respect to the parameters $(\\ln k, m, n)$. Let $y = \\ln \\hat r$, $x_1 = \\ln C_A$, $x_2 = \\ln C_B$, $\\beta_0 = \\ln k$, $\\beta_1 = m$, and $\\beta_2 = n$. The model becomes:\n$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\epsilon$$\nThe key features of this transformed linear model are:\n1.  The error term $\\epsilon$ is now additive.\n2.  The error term is normally distributed with mean zero: $E[\\epsilon] = 0$.\n3.  The error term has a constant variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\epsilon) = \\sigma^2$. The error is homoscedastic.\n4.  The independent variables, $x_1 = \\ln C_A$ and $x_2 = \\ln C_B$, can be treated as exact (non-random) because the problem states their setting uncertainty is negligible.\n\nThese are precisely the conditions under which ordinary least squares (OLS) regression provides the best linear unbiased estimators (BLUE) for the parameters, as established by the Gauss-Markov theorem. Given the normality of the errors, the OLS estimators are also the maximum likelihood estimators and are thus the most efficient unbiased estimators.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate procedure is to perform a multiple linear regression of $\\ln \\hat r$ on $\\ln C_A$ and $\\ln C_B$. The regression will yield estimates for the coefficients $\\beta_1=m$ and $\\beta_2=n$, and the intercept $\\beta_0=\\ln k$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Fit a multiple linear regression to transformed data by regressing $\\ln \\hat r$ on $\\ln C_A$ and $\\ln C_B$ across all runs to estimate the slope coefficients as $m$ and $n$ and the intercept as $\\ln k$. Use ordinary least squares because the multiplicative, approximately log-normal rate error becomes additive with constant variance on the log scale, and concentration-setting errors are negligible. Include the full $3\\times 3$ dataset (rather than two-point subsets) and replicates to estimate variance, examine residuals versus fitted values on the log scale for homoscedasticity and normality, and then exponentiate the intercept to obtain $k$ and its confidence interval. For temperature dependence, repeat at multiple $T$ and regress $\\ln k$ versus $1/T$.**\n\nThis option is a textbook description of the correct procedure. It correctly identifies that the log transformation linearizes the model and, crucially, stabilizes the variance, making OLS the appropriate estimation method. It correctly notes the importance of the negligible error in the concentration settings. The procedural details—using the full dataset for efficiency, using replicates to assess pure error, and performing residual diagnostics—constitute sound statistical practice. The final comment on Arrhenius analysis is correct, reinforcing the overall validity of the proposed kinetic analysis workflow.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Fit the raw-scale model $r = k\\,C_A^m\\,C_B^n$ by unweighted nonlinear least squares on $\\hat r$ to avoid transformation-induced bias. Take $m$ as $m = \\left(\\partial r/\\partial C_A\\right)\\,(C_A/r)$ evaluated at the mean $(C_A,C_B)$ to initialize the solver, and compute standard errors from the Hessian without weighting or transformation.**\n\nThis option is flawed. Unweighted nonlinear least squares (NLS) minimizes the sum of squared differences, $\\sum (\\hat r_i - r_i)^2$. This is only optimal if the absolute error variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat r_i)$, is constant for all data points. The problem explicitly states a multiplicative error structure, $\\operatorname{SD}(\\hat r) \\approx 0.05\\,r$, which means $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat r) \\approx (0.05\\,r)^2$. The variance is strongly dependent on the value of the rate, i.e., it is heteroscedastic. Using unweighted NLS gives undue influence to measurements with large rates (and thus large variance), leading to inefficient and potentially biased parameter estimates. A proper approach on the original scale would require *weighted* NLS, with weights $w_i \\propto 1/\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat r_i) \\propto 1/r_i^2$. The argument to \"avoid transformation-induced bias\" is a red herring; the severe violation of the constant variance assumption by unweighted NLS is a much more serious statistical error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Hold one reactant in large excess to enforce pseudo-first-order conditions, then, for each run, monitor the reaction progress and compute the slope of $\\ln r$ versus $t$ to extract the apparent order with respect to the limiting reactant. Repeat with the other reactant in excess to obtain both $m$ and $n$, average across runs, and finally determine $k$ at the single $T$ without transforming the data.**\n\nThis option describes a completely different experiment and analysis method (the method of isolation using an integral or differential analysis of concentration versus time data). The problem clearly states that a matrix of *initial rate* measurements was already collected from a $3 \\times 3$ factorial design. The task is to analyze the data that has been provided, not to propose a new experimental campaign. Furthermore, the proposed analysis step, \"compute the slope of $\\ln r$ versus $t$\", is not a standard or straightforward way to determine reaction order from progress-curve data. This entire option is irrelevant to the stated problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Assemble the triplets $(\\ln C_A,\\ln C_B,\\ln \\hat r)$ across runs and apply principal component analysis to estimate the normal vector of the best-fit plane in this three-dimensional space, taking the components in proportion to $(-m,-n,1)$. Because there is error in all three recorded quantities, principal component regression obviates the need for weighting or replication and yields $m$ and $n$ without assuming a particular error distribution.**\n\nThis option suggests an errors-in-variables regression model (such as total least squares or orthogonal regression, which can be implemented via PCA). Such models are appropriate only when there are significant measurement errors in the independent (predictor) variables as well as the dependent (response) variable. However, the problem statement explicitly specifies that the uncertainties in $C_A$ and $C_B$ are \"negligible\". Therefore, treating $\\ln C_A$ and $\\ln C_B$ as error-free predictors is the correct approach. Using a more complex errors-in-variables method is unnecessary and inappropriate, as it fails to incorporate this crucial information about the error structure. The claims that this method \"obviates the need for weighting or replication\" and works \"without assuming a particular error distribution\" are also false. Such methods still rely on assumptions about the relative error variances and require distributional assumptions for statistical inference.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, Option A is the only procedure described that is statistically optimal and appropriate for the given experimental design and meticulously specified error structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2516479"}, {"introduction": "Once a rate constant $k$ is determined, its temperature dependence, governed by the Arrhenius equation, reveals the activation energy $E_a$.

The problem is neither trivial nor ill-posed, requiring a rigorous step-by-step derivation. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Two-Point Estimator for $E_a$.\nThe Arrhenius relation for the true rate constant $k(T)$ at two distinct temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ is given by:\n$$k(T_1) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T_1}\\right)$$\n$$k(T_2) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T_2}\\right)$$\nHere, $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, and $R$ is the universal gas constant. To eliminate the unknown pre-exponential factor $A$ and solve for $E_a$, we take the natural logarithm of both equations. This is a standard procedure that transforms the exponential relationship into a linear one.\n$$\\ln(k(T_1)) = \\ln(A) - \\frac{E_a}{R T_1}$$\n$$\\ln(k(T_2)) = \\ln(A) - \\frac{E_a}{R T_2}$$\nThis forms a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $\\ln(A)$ and $E_a$. We are interested in finding $E_a$. Subtracting the first equation from the second eliminates $\\ln(A)$:\n$$\\ln(k(T_2)) - \\ln(k(T_1)) = \\left(\\ln(A) - \\frac{E_a}{R T_2}\\right) - \\left(\\ln(A) - \\frac{E_a}{R T_1}\\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(x) - \\ln(y) = \\ln(x/y)$, the left side simplifies. The right side simplifies by canceling $\\ln(A)$:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{k(T_2)}{k(T_1)}\\right) = \\frac{E_a}{R T_1} - \\frac{E_a}{R T_2}$$\nFactor out the term $\\frac{E_a}{R}$ on the right-hand side:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{k(T_2)}{k(T_1)}\\right) = \\frac{E_a}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)$$\nTo isolate $E_a$, we first combine the terms in the parenthesis by finding a common denominator:\n$$\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2} = \\frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2}$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation gives:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{k(T_2)}{k(T_1)}\\right) = \\frac{E_a}{R} \\left(\\frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2}\\right)$$\nSolving for the true activation energy $E_a$ yields the two-point formula:\n$$E_a = R \\left(\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{k(T_2)}{k(T_1)}\\right)$$\nThis is the expression for the ideal activation energy based on error-free measurements. The two-point estimator $\\hat{E}_a$ is constructed by replacing the true rate constants $k(T_i)$ with the measured, error-prone rate constants $\\tilde{k}_i$:\n$$\\hat{E}_a = R \\left(\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{k}_2}{\\tilde{k}_1}\\right)$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Estimator Bias.\nThe bias of the estimator $\\hat{E}_a$ is defined as the expected difference between the estimated value and the true value, $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{E}_a] - E_a$. We start by substituting the error model $\\tilde{k}_i = k(T_i)(1 + \\epsilon_i)$ into the expression for $\\hat{E}_a$:\n$$\\hat{E}_a = R \\left(\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{k(T_2)(1 + \\epsilon_2)}{k(T_1)(1 + \\epsilon_1)}\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(xy) = \\ln(x) + \\ln(y)$, we separate the terms involving the true rate constants from those involving the errors:\n$$\\hat{E}_a = R \\left(\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1}\\right) \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{k(T_2)}{k(T_1)}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + \\epsilon_2}{1 + \\epsilon_1}\\right) \\right]$$\nDistributing the leading constant term yields:\n$$\\hat{E}_a = R \\left(\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{k(T_2)}{k(T_1)}\\right) + R \\left(\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + \\epsilon_2}{1 + \\epsilon_1}\\right)$$\nThe first term is precisely the expression for the true activation energy $E_a$. Therefore:\n$$\\hat{E}_a = E_a + R \\left(\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1}\\right) \\left[ \\ln(1 + \\epsilon_2) - \\ln(1 + \\epsilon_1) \\right]$$\nThe bias of the estimator is then:\n$$\\text{Bias} = \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{E}_a - E_a] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ R \\left(\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1}\\right) \\left\\{ \\ln(1 + \\epsilon_2) - \\ln(1 + \\epsilon_1) \\right\\} \\right]$$\nSince $R$, $T_1$, and $T_2$ are constants, they can be factored out of the expectation. By the linearity of the expectation operator, we have:\n$$\\text{Bias} = R \\left(\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1}\\right) \\left( \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(1 + \\epsilon_2)] - \\mathbb{E}[\\ln(1 + \\epsilon_1)] \\right)$$\nTo proceed, we must evaluate the expectation of the logarithmic terms. The problem specifies to use a second-order Taylor expansion of $\\ln(1 + x)$ around $x=0$. The expansion is:\n$$\\ln(1 + x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + O(x^3)$$\nWe apply this expansion to $\\epsilon_i$, where $|\\epsilon_i| \\ll 1$:\n$$\\ln(1 + \\epsilon_i) \\approx \\epsilon_i - \\frac{\\epsilon_i^2}{2}$$\nWe take the expectation of this approximate expression:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\ln(1 + \\epsilon_i)] \\approx \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\epsilon_i - \\frac{\\epsilon_i^2}{2}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_i] - \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_i^2]$$\nWe are given that $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_i] = 0$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(\\epsilon_i) = \\sigma_i^2$. The variance is defined as $\\operatorname{Var}(\\epsilon_i) = \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_i^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_i])^2$. Since the mean is zero, we have $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_i^2] = \\sigma_i^2$. Substituting these into the expectation gives:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\ln(1 + \\epsilon_i)] \\approx 0 - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_i^2 = -\\frac{\\sigma_i^2}{2}$$\nThis holds for both $i=1$ and $i=2$. Now we substitute these results back into our expression for the bias:\n$$\\text{Bias} \\approx R \\left(\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1}\\right) \\left( \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{2}\\right) \\right)$$\nSimplifying the term in parentheses, we obtain:\n$$\\text{Bias} \\approx R \\left(\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_2 - T_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_1^2 - \\sigma_2^2}{2}\\right)$$\nThis gives the final analytical expression for the leading-order bias of the two-point estimator for the activation energy. The expression shows that the bias is zero only if the variances of the multiplicative errors at the two temperatures are equal. If the measurement at the lower temperature $T_1$ is noisier ($\\sigma_1^2 > \\sigma_2^2$), the activation energy is systematically overestimated. Conversely, if the measurement at the higher temperature $T_2$ is noisier ($\\sigma_2^2 > \\sigma_1^2$), the activation energy is systematically underestimated.

Compute its value under the stated conditions. Round your answer to three significant figures and express it as a pure number (no units).", "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in chemical reaction engineering concerning internal diffusion limitations in a porous catalyst.\n\nThe objective is to compute the value of the dimensionless group that compares the observed volumetric reaction rate to the intrapellet diffusive transport capacity. This group is known as the Weisz-Prater criterion, denoted by $\\Phi_{WP}$. For a first-order reaction occurring within a spherical porous catalyst pellet, the Weisz-Prater criterion is defined as:\n$$\n\\Phi_{WP} = \\frac{(-r_{A,obs}) R_p^2}{D_e C_{As}}\n$$\nwhere $(-r_{A,obs})$ is the observed reaction rate per unit volume of the catalyst pellet, $R_p$ is the radius of the pellet, $D_e$ is the effective diffusivity of the reactant within the pellet, and $C_{As}$ is the concentration of the reactant at the external surface of the pellet. We will now proceed to calculate each term based on the provided data. All calculations will be performed using SI base units.\n\nFirst, we calculate the observed reaction rate, $(-r_{A,obs})$. For a differential packed-bed reactor, the molar rate of reaction is related to the molar feed rate $F_{A0}$ and conversion $X$ by the design equation, expressed in terms of catalyst volume $V_{\\mathrm{cat}}$:\n$$\n(-r_{A,obs}) V_{\\mathrm{cat}} = F_{A0} X\n$$\nThus, the observed rate is:\n$$\n(-r_{A,obs}) = \\frac{F_{A0} X}{V_{\\mathrm{cat}}}\n$$\nThe given values are $F_{A0} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $X = 0.100$, and $V_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 2.00\\ \\mathrm{mL} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}^3$.\n$$\n(-r_{A,obs}) = \\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times 0.100}{2.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}^3} = 50.0\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nSecond, we determine the concentration of the reactant, carbon monoxide (species $A$), at the catalyst surface, $C_{As}$. The problem states that external mass transfer resistance is negligible, which implies that the surface concentration $C_{As}$ is equal to the bulk gas-phase concentration $C_{Ab}$. As the reactor is differential, we can approximate the bulk concentration using the inlet conditions. Assuming ideal gas behavior, the total molar concentration is $C_{\\text{total}} = P/(RT)$. The concentration of species $A$ is then $C_{As} = y_{A} C_{\\text{total}} = y_{A}P/(RT)$.\nThe given values are $y_{A} = 0.0500$, $P = 1.01325 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, $T = 500\\ \\mathrm{K}$, and $R = 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n$$\nC_{As} = \\frac{0.0500 \\times (1.01325 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa})}{(8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (500\\ \\mathrm{K})} \\approx 1.2187\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\n\nThird, we calculate the effective diffusivity, $D_e$. The effective diffusivity in a porous medium is given by $D_e = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau} D_{A,\\text{eff}}$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the porosity, $\\tau$ is the tortuosity, and $D_{A,\\text{eff}}$ is the diffusivity in a single pore accounting for both molecular and Knudsen diffusion. The inverse of $D_{A,\\text{eff}}$ is the sum of the inverses of the molecular diffusivity $D_m$ and the Knudsen diffusivity $D_K$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{D_{A,\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{D_m} + \\frac{1}{D_K}\n$$\nThe Knudsen diffusivity $D_K$ is calculated using the formula:\n$$\nD_K = \\frac{2}{3} r_p \\sqrt{\\frac{8RT}{\\pi M_A}}\n$$\nwhere $r_p$ is the mean pore radius and $M_A$ is the molar mass of species $A$. We are given $r_p = 50.0\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $M_A = 28.01\\ \\mathrm{g}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = 2.801 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n$$\nD_K = \\frac{2}{3} (5.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\sqrt{\\frac{8 \\times (8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (500\\ \\mathrm{K})}{\\pi \\times (2.801 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1})}} \\approx 2.049 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, using the given molecular diffusivity $D_m = 3.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, we find $D_{A,\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{D_{A,\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{3.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} + \\frac{1}{2.049 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx (33333 + 48799)\\ \\mathrm{s}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} = 82132\\ \\mathrm{s}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$\n$$\nD_{A,\\text{eff}} = \\frac{1}{82132}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 1.2176 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the effective diffusivity $D_e$ using the porosity $\\varepsilon = 0.40$ and tortuosity $\\tau = 3.0$:\n$$\nD_e = \\frac{0.40}{3.0} \\times (1.2176 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\approx 1.623 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe final component required is the square of the pellet radius.
