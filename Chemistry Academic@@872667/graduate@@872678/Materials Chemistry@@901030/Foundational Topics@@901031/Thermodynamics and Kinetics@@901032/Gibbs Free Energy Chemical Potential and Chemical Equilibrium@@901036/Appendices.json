This is precisely the condition for a common tangent line.\n\nIn summary, on a graph of $g(x, T)$ versus $x$ at a fixed temperature below the critical point:\n-   The **binodal** compositions are the two points of tangency of a common tangent line to the $g(x)$ curve. A system with an overall composition between these points will achieve its lowest Gibbs free energy by separating into two phases with these binodal compositions.\n-   The **spinodal** compositions are the two inflection points of the $g(x)$ curve, where $\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2}=0$.\n\nThe region between the binodal and spinodal curves is metastable.

Let $f_{\\alpha}$ and $f_{\\beta}$ be the mole fractions of the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ phases, respectively. The lever rule states:\n$$ f_{\\alpha} = \\frac{x_{\\beta} - x_B^{0}}{x_{\\beta} - x_{\\alpha}} $$\n$$ f_{\\beta} = \\frac{x_B^{0} - x_{\\alpha}}{x_{\\beta} - x_{\\alpha}} $$\nWe are asked to find the equilibrium mole fraction of the $\\alpha$ phase, $f_{\\alpha}$. Substituting the known values:\n$$ f_{\\alpha} = \\frac{0.75 - 0.40}{0.75 - 0.25} = \\frac{0.35}{0.50} = 0.7 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, the mole fraction of the $\\alpha$ phase is $0.7000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7000}$$", "id": "2488780"}]}
