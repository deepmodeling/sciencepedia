Classification of the Transition Order\n\nAccording to the Ehrenfest classification of phase transitions, the order is determined by the lowest-order derivative of the Gibbs free energy ($G$) that shows a discontinuity at the transition temperature ($T_{tr}$).\n\n- A **first-order transition** is defined by a discontinuity in the first derivatives of $G$, such as entropy $S = -(\\partial G/\\partial T)_P$. This implies a finite latent heat of transition, $\\Delta H = T_{tr} \\Delta S \\neq 0$. In a DSC experiment, this latent heat manifests as a peak in the heat flow signal, the area of which corresponds to $\\Delta H$. The heat capacity, $C_p = T(\\partial S/\\partial T)_P$, is a second derivative of $G$ and theoretically diverges (a delta function) at $T_{tr}$.\n\n- A **second-order transition** is defined by continuous first derivatives of $G$ (hence $\\Delta S = 0$ and $\\Delta H = 0$), but a discontinuity in the second derivatives, such as the heat capacity $C_p$. This manifests in a DSC experiment as a step-like change in the heat capacity baseline at $T_{tr}$, but with no latent heat peak.\n\nThe analysis of the experimental data leads to the following conclusions:\n1.  Our calculation in Part 1 demonstrates that the transition involves a substantial, non-zero latent heat: $\\Delta H_m \\approx 12.36\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. A non-zero latent heat is the definitive signature of a first-order phase transition.\n2.  The problem statement explicitly mentions that \"No resolvable step-like change in the baseline specific heat capacity is detected outside the transient Gaussian features.\" This observation is consistent with a first-order transition and inconsistent with a second-order transition, which would be defined by such a step.\n3.  The data show thermal hysteresis, with the transition occurring at $T_h = 367.2\\ \\mathrm{K}$ on heating and $T_c = 359.8\\ \\mathrm{K}$ on cooling. This hysteresis ($T_h - T_c = 7.4\\ \\mathrm{K}$) is a kinetic phenomenon commonly observed in first-order transitions, which often require superheating or supercooling to proceed, but is absent in ideal second-order transitions.\n\nBased on the primary evidence of a finite latent heat, supported by the absence of a $C_p$ step and the presence of thermal hysteresis, the solid–solid transformation is unambiguously classified as **first-order**.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{12.36}\n$$", "id": "2530418"}, {"introduction": "Real-world materials often exhibit complex thermal behavior where multiple processes, such as melting and decomposition, occur in the same temperature range.
