We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first task is to derive the direct-current (DC) conductivity, $\\sigma$. We start from Newton's second law for the average, or drift, velocity $\\mathbf{v}_d$ of a charge carrier. In the semiclassical relaxation-time approximation, the equation of motion for an electron with charge $-e$ and effective mass $m^{\\ast}$ in a static electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is given by:\n$$ m^{\\ast}\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_d}{dt} = -e\\mathbf{E} - \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{\\tau}\\mathbf{v}_d $$\nThe term $-e\\mathbf{E}$ is the force exerted by the electric field, and the term $-\\frac{m^{\\ast}}{\\tau}\\mathbf{v}_d$ is a phenomenological damping force representing the net effect of scattering events, where $\\tau$ is the momentum-relaxation time. For a DC conductivity measurement, the system is in a steady state, which implies that the drift velocity is constant, and its time derivative is zero: $\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_d}{dt} = 0$. The equation of motion thus simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = -e\\mathbf{E} - \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{\\tau}\\mathbf{v}_d $$\nWe can solve this algebraic equation for the steady-state drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_d$:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_d = -\\frac{e\\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\\mathbf{E} $$\nThe electric current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is defined as the product of the charge density and the drift velocity.

This is a significant result. It indicates that an electron does not simply bounce off every atom it encounters. Instead, within the quantum mechanical picture, the electron wave propagates freely through a perfect periodic lattice, and scattering only occurs due to deviations from this perfect periodicity, such as lattice vibrations (phonons) and impurities.

This separation of charge establishes a transverse electric field, the Hall field $\\mathbf{E}_H = E_y \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$. This field, in turn, exerts an electric force on the carriers, $\\mathbf{F}_E = q\\mathbf{E}_H = qE_y \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$.\n\nIn the steady state, there is no net transverse current, which implies that the net force on the charge carriers in the $y$-direction must be zero.

The equality holds. The common energy dependence $E^r$ can be factored out of the summation of rates and then factored out of the energy average. The rule is therefore exact in this case. The temperature $T$ affects the value of the average $\\langle\\langle E^r \\rangle\\rangle$, but it does not affect the validity of the rule.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Even if $r_1 \\neq r_2$, in the nondegenerate limit the additive-inverse combination becomes asymptotically exact when one mechanism dominates the total rate throughout the entire thermally active (“Fermi window”) energy range.**\n\nAssume scattering mechanism 1 is dominant, meaning its scattering rate is much higher: $1/\\tau_1(E) \\gg 1/\\tau_2(E)$ for all relevant energies. This implies $\\tau_1(E) \\ll \\tau_2(E)$.\nLet's analyze the exact total mobility. $\\tau_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E) = (\\tau_1(E)^{-1} + \\tau_2(E)^{-1})^{-1} \\approx \\tau_1(E)$.\nSo, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\propto \\langle\\langle \\tau_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E) \\rangle\\rangle \\approx \\langle\\langle \\tau_1(E) \\rangle\\rangle \\propto \\mu_1$. In the limit as $\\tau_2 \\to \\infty$ (i.e., scattering mechanism 2 vanishes), $\\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ approaches $\\mu_1$ exactly.\nNow, let's analyze Matthiessen's rule: $1/\\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1/\\mu_1 + 1/\\mu_2$.\nSince $\\tau_1 \\ll \\tau_2$, the averaging process preserves this strong inequality, so $\\mu_1 \\ll \\mu_2$. This means $1/\\mu_1 \\gg 1/\\mu_2$.\nThus, the rule predicts $1/\\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\approx 1/\\mu_1$, which means $\\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\approx \\mu_1$.\nBoth the exact expression and Matthiessen's rule yield the same limiting behavior: $\\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\to \\mu_1$. The relative error between the rule and the exact value tends to zero as the ratio of the scattering rates $\\tau_1/\\tau_2 \\to 0$. The rule becomes \"asymptotically exact\".\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. In a degenerate semiconductor at low temperature, the additive-inverse combination generally fails unless $r_1 = r_2$, because the energy averaging over the narrow window around the Fermi level emphasizes different energy dependences.**\n\nThis option changes the context to a degenerate semiconductor at low temperature ($T \\to 0$). In this limit, the derivative of the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, $-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}$, approaches a Dirac delta function centered at the Fermi energy, $E_F$: $-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E} \\to \\delta(E-E_F)$.\nThe conductivity integral, which involves the energy averaging, simplifies to an evaluation at $E=E_F$.\n$$ \\sigma \\propto \\int_0^\\infty \\tau(E) E D(E) \\delta(E-E_F) dE \\propto \\tau(E_F) E_F D(E_F) $$\nTherefore, the mobility is simply proportional to the relaxation time evaluated at the Fermi energy: $\\mu \\propto \\tau(E_F)$. The averaging process collapses.\nThe total mobility is $\\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\propto \\tau_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E_F) = (\\tau_1(E_F)^{-1} + \\tau_2(E_F)^{-1})^{-1}$.\nThe partial mobilities are $\\mu_1 \\propto \\tau_1(E_F)$ and $\\mu_2 \\propto \\tau_2(E_F)$.\nChecking Matthiessen's rule:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}}} \\propto \\frac{1}{(\\tau_1(E_F)^{-1} + \\tau_2(E_F)^{-1})^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_1(E_F)} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_2(E_F)} $$\nThe right side of the rule is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu_1} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_2} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\tau_1(E_F)} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_2(E_F)} $$\nThe equality is exact, regardless of the energy dependence of $\\tau_1$ and $\\tau_2$ (i.e., for any $r_1, r_2$). The statement claims the combination *fails* unless $r_1=r_2$. This is precisely the opposite of the correct conclusion. The collapse of averaging to a single energy point *guarantees* the rule's exactness.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If the microscopic scattering potentials are statistically correlated (for example, correlated alloy disorder and strain fields, or charged impurities spatially correlated with dislocations), cross terms in the transition probability appear, violating independence and invalidating simple inverse additivity of mobilities.**\n\nMatthiessen's rule is a macroscopic consequence of the microscopic additivity of scattering *rates*, $1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E) = \\sum_i 1/\\tau_i(E)$. This additivity, in turn, is derived from Fermi's Golden Rule for the transition probability between quantum states, assuming the total scattering potential is a sum of independent potentials, $U = U_1 + U_2$. The transition rate is proportional to $|\\langle f |U_1+U_2| i \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle f |U_1| i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f |U_2| i \\rangle|^2 + 2\\mathrm{Re}(\\langle f |U_1| i \\rangle \\langle i |U_2| f \\rangle)$.\nThe additivity of rates requires that the interference term, $2\\mathrm{Re}(\\dots)$, averages to zero when summed over all scattering events and possible configurations of scatterers. This is true if the scattering potentials $U_1$ and $U_2$ are statistically uncorrelated. If they are correlated, as the examples suggest, this interference term is non-zero.\nThis invalidates the starting assumption that $1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1/\\tau_1 + 1/\\tau_2$. If the rates themselves do not add, any rule derived from that premise, such as the inverse additivity of mobilities, is fundamentally invalid. This is a well-known breakdown of Matthiessen's rule.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. For strongly inelastic scattering (for example, polar optical phonons at high temperature), the relaxation-time approximation guarantees exact additivity of inverse mobilities because the total momentum-relaxation rate is always the sum of the partial rates at each energy.**\n\nThis statement has two major flaws.\nFirst, the relaxation-time approximation (RTA) is, strictly speaking, not valid for strongly inelastic scattering processes like optical phonon scattering. In an inelastic collision, the energy of the carrier changes significantly, so the rate of scattering out of a state at energy $E$ is not balanced by scattering into that state from other states. The BTE becomes an integral equation that cannot be simplified by defining a single $\\tau(E)$. Using an \"effective\" RTA in this case is a significant approximation, not a guarantee of exactness.\nSecond, even if we ignore the invalidity of the RTA and assume we can define energy-dependent relaxation times $\\tau_i(E)$ for all mechanisms, and even if we assume the scattering mechanisms are independent such that their rates add ($1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\sum_i 1/\\tau_i$), we have already shown in case A that inverse mobilities add *only if* all scattering mechanisms have the same energy dependence. The energy dependence for optical phonon scattering is very different from that of elastic mechanisms like ionized impurity or acoustic phonon scattering. Therefore, the condition $r_1=r_2$ is violated, and Matthiessen's rule is not exact.\nThe statement's reasoning is fallacious: it uses a necessary condition (additivity of rates) as if it were a sufficient condition for the additivity of inverse mobilities.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2472621"}]}
