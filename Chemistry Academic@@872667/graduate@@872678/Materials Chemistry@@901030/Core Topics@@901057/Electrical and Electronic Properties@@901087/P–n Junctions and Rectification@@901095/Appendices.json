It is a fundamental problem in semiconductor physics. Therefore, it is valid, and we shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe determination of thermal-equilibrium carrier concentrations in a uniformly doped semiconductor rests upon two fundamental principles: the law of mass action and the condition of local charge neutrality.\n\nFirst, the law of mass action states that for a non-degenerate semiconductor in thermal equilibrium, the product of the hole concentration $p$ and the electron concentration $n$ is a constant, equal to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$.\n$$pn = n_i^2$$\nWe are given $n_{i}=1.5\\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.\n\nSecond, the principle of charge neutrality requires that the total positive charge density must equal the total negative charge density within any macroscopic volume of the material. In the bulk semiconductor, far from any space-charge regions, the positive charges are holes (concentration $p$) and ionized donor atoms (concentration $N_D^+$). The negative charges are electrons (concentration $n$) and ionized acceptor atoms (concentration $N_A^-$). The neutrality equation is therefore:\n$$p + N_D^+ = n + N_A^-$$\nThe problem specifies that we assume complete ionization of all dopant atoms. This means that every donor atom has donated an electron, and every acceptor atom has accepted an electron. Thus, we have $N_D^+ = N_D$ and $N_A^- = N_A$. Substituting these into the charge neutrality equation gives:\n$$p + N_D = n + N_A$$\nWe are given the ionized acceptor density $N_{A}=5.0\\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and the ionized donor density $N_{D}=1.0\\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $p$ and $n$:\n1. $pn = n_i^2$\n2. $p + N_D = n + N_A$\n\nWe can solve this system. Let us first rearrange the neutrality equation to express one variable in terms of the other:\n$$p - n = N_A - N_D$$\nThis quantity, $N_A - N_D$, is the net or effective acceptor concentration. Since $N_A > N_D$, the material is p-type, and holes are the majority carriers, meaning $p \\gg n$.\n\nFrom the mass action law, we can express $n$ as $n = \\frac{n_i^2}{p}$. Substituting this into the rearranged neutrality equation yields:\n$$p - \\frac{n_i^2}{p} = N_A - N_D$$\nMultiplying by $p$ (which is non-zero) and rearranging gives a quadratic equation for the majority carrier concentration $p$:\n$$p^2 - (N_A - N_D)p - n_i^2 = 0$$\nThis is a standard quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with $x=p$, $a=1$, $b=-(N_A - N_D)$, and $c=-n_i^2$. The solution is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$p = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{(N_A - N_D) \\pm \\sqrt{(-(N_A - N_D))^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$p = \\frac{(N_A - N_D) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nSince the carrier concentration $p$ must be a positive physical quantity, we must select the positive root:\n$$p = \\frac{(N_A - N_D) + \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n$N_A = 5.0 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n$N_D = 1.0 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n$n_i = 1.5 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n\nThe effective acceptor concentration is:\n$$N_A - N_D = (5.0 \\times 10^{17} - 1.0 \\times 10^{17})\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$$\nLet us evaluate the terms in the solution for $p$:\n$$(N_A - N_D)^2 = (4.0 \\times 10^{17})^2 = 1.6 \\times 10^{35}$$\n$$4n_i^2 = 4 \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{10})^2 = 4 \\times 2.25 \\times 10^{20} = 9.0 \\times 10^{20}$$\nObserve that $(N_A - N_D)^2 \\gg 4n_i^2$.

No flaws from the checklist are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to find $|E_{t}-E_{i}|$. This requires determining the activation energies from the two specified temperature regimes.\n\n**1. High-Temperature (Diffusion-Limited) Regime**\n\nIn this regime, the reverse current density $J_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is dominated by the diffusion current, $J_{\\mathrm{diff}}$. This current is proportional to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_{i}^{2}$. The provided relation for $n_{i}(T)$ is $n_{i}(T) \\propto T^{3/2}\\exp\\big(-E_{g}/(2k_{B}T)\\big)$. Therefore, the temperature dependence of $n_{i}^{2}$ is:\n$$\nn_{i}^{2}(T) \\propto \\left(T^{3/2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{g}}{2k_{B}T}\\right)\\right)^{2} = T^{3}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{g}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe full diffusion current density involves transport parameters ($D$, $L$) which also have temperature dependencies. However, the problem specifies that an experimental plot of $\\ln(J_{\\mathrm{rev}}/T^{3})$ versus $1/T$ is a straight line. This construction effectively defines the model being tested, implying that the dominant temperature dependence of the current can be expressed as:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{rev}}(T) = J_{\\mathrm{diff}}(T) \\approx C_{H} T^{3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{g}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C_{H}$ is a constant incorporating material parameters. The activation energy in this regime, $E_{A,H}$, is the band gap, $E_{g}$.\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of $J_{\\mathrm{rev}}/T^{3}$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{J_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{T^{3}}\\right) = \\ln(C_{H}) - \\frac{E_{g}}{k_{B}} \\frac{1}{T}\n$$\nThis is a linear equation in the form $y = c + mx$, where $y = \\ln(J_{\\mathrm{rev}}/T^{3})$, $x = 1/T$, and the slope $m = S_{H}$. By comparing the theoretical form to the experimental slope $S_{H}$, we find:\n$$\nS_{H} = -\\frac{E_{g}}{k_{B}}\n$$\nThis allows us to express the band gap energy in terms of the high-temperature slope:\n$$\nE_{g} = -k_{B} S_{H}\n$$\n\n**2. Low-Temperature (SRH Generation) Regime**\n\nIn this regime, the current is dominated by thermal generation of electron-hole pairs via deep-level traps in the depletion region, $J_{\\mathrm{gr}}$. The problem states the functional form:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{gr}}(T) \\propto n_{i}(T)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|E_{t}-E_{i}|}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the dependence for $n_{i}(T) \\propto T^{3/2}\\exp\\big(-E_{g}/(2k_{B}T)\\big)$:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{gr}}(T) \\propto T^{3/2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{g}}{2k_{B}T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|E_{t}-E_{i}|}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nCombining the exponential terms gives the overall temperature dependence:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{gr}}(T) \\approx C_{L} T^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{g}/2 + |E_{t}-E_{i}|}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $C_{L}$ is a proportionality constant. The total activation energy for this process is $E_{A,L} = E_{g}/2 + |E_{t}-E_{i}|$.\n\nThe experimental data for this window is a linear plot of $\\ln(J_{\\mathrm{rev}}/T^{3/2})$ versus $1/T$. We proceed as before:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{J_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{T^{3/2}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{J_{\\mathrm{gr}}}{T^{3/2}}\\right) = \\ln(C_{L}) - \\frac{E_{g}/2 + |E_{t}-E_{i}|}{k_{B}} \\frac{1}{T}\n$$\nThe slope of this plot, $S_{L}$, is therefore:\n$$\nS_{L} = -\\frac{E_{g}/2 + |E_{t}-E_{i}|}{k_{B}}\n$$\n\n**3. Calculation of $|E_{t}-E_{i}|**\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1. $E_{g} = -k_{B} S_{H}$\n2. $E_{g}/2 + |E_{t}-E_{i}| = -k_{B} S_{L}$\n\nWe wish to find $|E_{t}-E_{i}|$. We can substitute the expression for $E_{g}$ from the first equation into the second equation:\n$$\n\\frac{-k_{B} S_{H}}{2} + |E_{t}-E_{i}| = -k_{B} S_{L}\n$$\nSolving for $|E_{t}-E_{i}|$:\n$$\n|E_{t}-E_{i}| = -k_{B} S_{L} + \\frac{k_{B} S_{H}}{2} = k_{B} \\left(\\frac{S_{H}}{2} - S_{L}\\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute the provided numerical values: $S_{H}=-1.300\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $S_{L}=-7.430\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $k_{B}=8.617333262\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}$.\n$$\n|E_{t}-E_{i}| = (8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\left(\\frac{-1.300\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{K}}{2} - (-7.430\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{K})\\right)\n$$\nFirst, evaluate the term in the parentheses:\n$$\n\\frac{-1.300\\times 10^{4}}{2} = -0.6500 \\times 10^{4} = -6.500 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{S_{H}}{2} - S_{L} = (-6.500 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{K}) - (-7.430\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{K}) = (-6.500 + 7.430) \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{K} = 0.930 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{K} = 930\\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$\nNow, complete the calculation for $|E_{t}-E_{i}|$:\n$$\n|E_{t}-E_{i}| = (8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\times (930\\,\\mathrm{K})\n$$\n$$\n|E_{t}-E_{i}| = 0.0801411993... \\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n|E_{t}-E_{i}| \\approx 0.08014\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThis result represents the energy separation of the dominant deep-level trap from the intrinsic Fermi level, which is approximately the middle of the band gap.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.08014} $$", "id": "2505693"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of understanding semiconductor physics is often to design and fabricate devices with specific performance characteristics.

Thus, we can approximate $J_{\\mathrm{f}} \\approx J_s \\exp(V_{\\mathrm{f}}/V_T)$.\n\nThe saturation current density, $J_s$, for a long-base diode with equal electron and hole lifetimes ($\\tau_n = \\tau_p = \\tau$) is:\n$$J_s = q n_i^2 \\left( \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_A} + \\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} \\right) = q n_i^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{D_n}}{N_A\\sqrt{\\tau}} + \\frac{\\sqrt{D_p}}{N_D\\sqrt{\\tau}} \\right) = \\frac{q n_i^2}{\\sqrt{\\tau}} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{D_n}}{N_A} + \\frac{\\sqrt{D_p}}{N_D} \\right)$$\nThe diffusion coefficients $D_n$ and $D_p$ are found using the Einstein relation, $D = \\mu V_T$:\n$$D_n = \\mu_n V_T = (800\\ \\mathrm{cm^2\\,V^{-1}\\,s^{-1}})(0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V}) = 20.68\\ \\mathrm{cm^2\\,s^{-1}}$$\n$$D_p = \\mu_p V_T = (300\\ \\mathrm{cm^2\\,V^{-1}\\,s^{-1}})(0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V}) = 7.756\\ \\mathrm{cm^2\\,s^{-1}}$$\nNow, we can solve for $\\tau$ by substituting the expression for $J_s$ into the forward current equation:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\frac{q n_i^2}{\\sqrt{\\tau}} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{D_n}}{N_A} + \\frac{\\sqrt{D_p}}{N_D} \\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{f}}}{V_T}\\right)$$\nSolving for $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = \\left[ \\frac{q n_i^2}{J_{\\mathrm{f}}} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{D_n}}{N_A} + \\frac{\\sqrt{D_p}}{N_D} \\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{f}}}{V_T}\\right) \\right]^2$$\nLet's compute the terms:\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{D_n}}{N_A} = \\frac{\\sqrt{20.68}}{1.0862 \\times 10^{17}} = \\frac{4.5475}{1.0862 \\times 10^{17}} = 4.186 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{cm^4\\,s^{-1/2}}$$\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{D_p}}{N_D} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7.756}}{1.0862 \\times 10^{18}} = \\frac{2.785}{1.0862 \\times 10^{18}} = 2.564 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{cm^4\\,s^{-1/2}}$$\nThe sum is $(4.186 \\times 10^{-17} + 0.02564 \\times 10^{-17}) = 4.212 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{cm^4\\,s^{-1/2}}$.\n$$\\sqrt{\\tau} = \\frac{(1.602\\times 10^{-19})(10^{10})^2}{5.00} (4.212 \\times 10^{-17}) (5.748 \\times 10^{11}) \\ \\mathrm{s^{1/2}}$$\n$$\\sqrt{\\tau} = (3.204 \\times 10^{-20}) (4.212 \\times 10^{-17}) (5.748 \\times 10^{11}) = 7.769 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s^{1/2}}$$\n$$\\tau = (7.769 \\times 10^{-5})^2 = 6.036 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe third step is to verify that these parameters satisfy the rectification ratio constraint, $R \\geq 1.00\\times 10^{6}$. The ratio is defined as $R = J(0.700\\ \\mathrm{V})/\\lvert J(-0.700\\ \\mathrm{V})\\rvert$. The reverse current at $V_R = 0.700\\ \\mathrm{V}$ is stated to be controlled by Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) generation in the depletion region.\n$$\\lvert J(-0.700\\ \\mathrm{V})\\rvert \\approx J_{\\mathrm{gen}} = \\frac{q n_i W}{2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{gen}}}$$\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{gen}}$ is given as equal to $\\tau$. $W$ is the depletion width under reverse bias $V_R$:\n$$W = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_s}{q}\\left(\\frac{1}{N_A}+\\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)(V_{\\mathrm{bi}} + V_R)}$$\nThe silicon permittivity is $\\varepsilon_s = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 = (11.7)(8.854 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{F\\,cm^{-1}}) = 1.036 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F\\,cm^{-1}}$.\nThe potential across the junction is $V_{\\mathrm{bi}} + V_R = 0.900\\ \\mathrm{V} + 0.700\\ \\mathrm{V} = 1.600\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\nThe doping term is $\\frac{1}{N_A}+\\frac{1}{N_D} = \\frac{1}{1.0862 \\times 10^{17}} + \\frac{1}{1.0862 \\times 10^{18}} = \\frac{1.1}{1.0862 \\times 10^{17}} = 1.0127 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{cm^3}$.\n$$W = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(1.036 \\times 10^{-12})}{1.602\\times 10^{-19}}(1.0127 \\times 10^{-17})(1.600)} = \\sqrt{2.089 \\times 10^{-10}} = 1.445 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$$\nThe generation current density is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{gen}} = \\frac{(1.602\\times 10^{-19})(10^{10})(1.445 \\times 10^{-5})}{2(6.036 \\times 10^{-9})} = 1.914 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{A\\,cm^{-2}}$$\nThe rectification ratio is:\n$$R = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{f}}}{J_{\\mathrm{gen}}} = \\frac{5.00}{1.914 \\times 10^{-6}} = 2.61 \\times 10^{6}$$\nThis value satisfies the condition $R \\geq 1.00\\times 10^{6}$. The derived parameters $\\{N_A, N_D, \\tau\\}$ are therefore consistent with all problem specifications.\n\nFinally, we confirm the validity of the underlying assumptions. The low-level injection condition requires the injected minority carrier concentration to be much less than the majority carrier concentration. On the p-side, the injected electron concentration is $n_p(-x_p) = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A} \\exp(\\frac{V_f}{V_T}) = \\frac{(10^{10})^2}{1.0862 \\times 10^{17}} (5.748 \\times 10^{11}) \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{14}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. This is much smaller than $N_A \\approx 1.09 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. The assumption is valid. The assumption that SRH generation dominates reverse leakage is also valid, as $J_{\\mathrm{gen}} \\approx 1.91 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{A\\,cm^{-2}}$ is orders of magnitude larger than the diffusion component $J_s = J_f / \\exp(V_f/V_T) \\approx 8.70 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{A\\,cm^{-2}}$.\n\nThe unique triple is determined. Rounding to three significant figures, we have:\n$N_A = 1.09 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n$N_D = 1.09 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n$\\tau = 6.04 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\nThe final results are presented as the requested row vector.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1.09 \\times 10^{17}  1.09 \\times 10^{18}  6.04 \\times 10^{-9} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2505698"}]}
