In a typical perovskite oxide, oxygen ions have a charge of $-2$, so an oxygen vacancy, $V_O$, is doubly positively charged, denoted as $V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet}$. The charge of such a vacancy is $q = ze = 2e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $z=2$. The concentration of mobile carriers is the concentration of free, unassociated vacancies, $n = [V]$. Therefore, the conductivity is:\n$$\n\\sigma(T) = [V](T) (2e) \\mu_V(T)\n$$\nBoth the free vacancy concentration $[V]$ and the vacancy mobility $\\mu_V$ are temperature-dependent. The apparent activation energy for conductivity is determined by the combined temperature dependence of these two terms. We analyze each term separately.\n\nFirst, we consider the vacancy mobility, $\\mu_V$. The mobility of ionic species is thermally activated and related to the diffusion coefficient $D_V$ through the Nernst-Einstein relation, $\\mu_V = \\frac{z e D_V}{k_B T}$. The diffusion coefficient itself follows an Arrhenius law:\n$$\nD_V(T) = D_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_m}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $H_m$ is the vacancy migration enthalpy, given as $0.67 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

The problem states we are in the extrinsic regime where the total dopant concentration, $[D]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, and total vacancy concentration, $[V]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, are fixed. The mass balance equations are:\n$$\n[D]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [D] + [DV]\n$$\n$$\n[V]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [V] + [DV]\n$$\nFor charge compensation of an acceptor dopant $D$ (e.g., $M^{3+}$ on a $B^{4+}$ site gives $M'_B$) by oxygen vacancies ($V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet}$), the charge neutrality condition is $[D']_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 2[V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, which in the problem's notation is $[D]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 2[V]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n\nThe problem specifies conditions of strong association, where $[DV] \\gg [V]$. This allows for simplification:\nFrom the vacancy mass balance, $[V]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [V] + [DV] \\approx [DV]$.\nUsing the charge neutrality relation, we find $[D]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 2[V]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\approx 2[DV]$.\nNow, substituting this into the dopant mass balance equation:\n$$\n[D]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\approx 2[DV] = [D] + [DV]\n$$\nThis implies $[D] \\approx [DV]$.
