The on-site energies are $\\epsilon_A$ and $\\epsilon_B$. The hopping occurs only between an $A$ site and its two nearest-neighbor $B$ sites with amplitude $t$. The $A$ site at $na$ has nearest neighbors $B$ at $na+a/2$ (in cell $n$) and at $(n-1)a+a/2$ (in cell $n-1$).\n\nThe real-space Hamiltonian is thus:\n$$ H = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\left( \\epsilon_A c_{n,A}^\\dagger c_{n,A} + \\epsilon_B c_{n,B}^\\dagger c_{n,B} \\right) - t \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\left( c_{n,A}^\\dagger c_{n,B} + c_{n,A}^\\dagger c_{n-1,B} + \\text{h.c.} \\right) $$\nwhere 'h.c.' stands for the Hermitian conjugate, and we impose periodic boundary conditions, implying $c_{0,B} \\equiv c_{N,B}$. Let's rewrite the hopping term to be more symmetric. The term $c_{n,A}^\\dagger c_{n-1,B}$ describes hopping from site $B$ in cell $n-1$ to site $A$ in cell $n$. Its sum is equivalent to $\\sum_n c_{n+1,A}^\\dagger c_{n,B}$.

Let us define the variable $x = \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$. The exponential terms in the equation can then be written as:\n$$\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{E_A - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{\\exp(E_A / (k_B T))}{x}$$\n$$\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{E_D - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{\\exp(E_D / (k_B T))}{x}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$$N_A \\frac{1}{1 + g_A \\frac{\\exp(E_A / (k_B T))}{x}} = N_D \\frac{g_D \\frac{\\exp(E_D / (k_B T))}{x}}{1 + g_D \\frac{\\exp(E_D / (k_B T))}{x}}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator of each side by $x$ simplifies the expression:\n$$N_A \\frac{x}{x + g_A \\exp(E_A / (k_B T))} = N_D \\frac{g_D \\exp(E_D / (k_B T))}{x + g_D \\exp(E_D / (k_B T))}$$\nCross-multiplication gives:\n$$N_A x \\left(x + g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) = N_D g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right) \\left(x + g_A \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_A}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)$$\nExpanding both sides:\n$$N_A x^2 + N_A g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right) x = N_D g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right) x + N_D g_D g_A \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D+E_A}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nWe rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:\n$$N_A x^2 + \\left(N_A g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right) - N_D g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) x - N_D g_D g_A \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D+E_A}{k_B T}\\right) = 0$$\n$$N_A x^2 + (N_A - N_D) g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right) x - N_D g_D g_A \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_A+E_D}{k_B T}\\right) = 0$$\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $x$ using the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$x = \\frac{-(N_A - N_D) g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right) \\pm \\sqrt{\\left((N_A - N_D) g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)^2 - 4N_A\\left(-N_D g_D g_A \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_A+E_D}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)}}{2N_A}$$\nSimplifying the expression under the square root (the discriminant $\\Delta$):\n$$\\Delta = (N_A - N_D)^2 g_D^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{2E_D}{k_B T}\\right) + 4 N_A N_D g_D g_A \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_A+E_D}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nSince all physical quantities ($N_A, N_D, g_A, g_D$) and the exponential terms are positive, the discriminant $\\Delta$ is always positive, guaranteeing two real roots for $x$.\nThe term $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is strictly greater than $\\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 g_D^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{2E_D}{k_B T}\\right)} = |(N_A - N_D) g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right)|$.\nThe variable $x = \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$ must be a positive real number. If we select the minus sign in the quadratic formula, the numerator becomes $(N_D - N_A)g_D\\exp(\\dots) - \\sqrt{\\Delta}$, which is always negative. As the denominator $2N_A$ is positive, the negative root for $x$ is unphysical. We must therefore select the positive root.\n$$x = \\frac{(N_D - N_A) g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right) + \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 g_D^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{2E_D}{k_B T}\\right) + 4 N_A N_D g_D g_A \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_A+E_D}{k_B T}\\right)}}{2N_A}$$\nWe can simplify the discriminant by factoring out $g_D^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{2E_D}{k_B T}\\right)$:\n$$\\Delta = g_D^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{2E_D}{k_B T}\\right) \\left[ (N_D - N_A)^2 + 4 N_A N_D \\frac{g_A}{g_D} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_A-E_D}{k_B T}\\right) \\right]$$\nSo, the solution for $x$ becomes:\n$$x = \\frac{(N_D - N_A) g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right) + g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right) \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4 N_A N_D \\frac{g_A}{g_D} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_A - E_D}{k_B T}\\right)}}{2N_A}$$\nFactoring out the common term $g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right)$ from the numerator:\n$$x = \\frac{g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right)}{2N_A} \\left[ (N_D - N_A) + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4 N_A N_D \\frac{g_A}{g_D} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_A - E_D}{k_B T}\\right)} \\right]$$\nTo find $E_F$, we recall that $x = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$ and take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\frac{E_F}{k_B T} = \\ln(x) = \\ln\\left\\{ \\frac{g_D}{2N_A} \\left[ (N_D - N_A) + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4 N_A N_D \\frac{g_A}{g_D} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_A - E_D}{k_B T}\\right)} \\right] \\right\\} + \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{E_F}{k_B T} = \\frac{E_D}{k_B T} + \\ln\\left\\{ \\frac{g_D}{2N_A} \\left[ (N_D - N_A) + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4 N_A N_D \\frac{g_A}{g_D} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_A - E_D}{k_B T}\\right)} \\right] \\right\\}$$\nFinally, multiplying by $k_B T$ gives the closed-form expression for the Fermi level $E_F$:\n$$E_F = E_D + k_B T \\ln\\left\\{ \\frac{g_D}{2N_A} \\left[ (N_D - N_A) + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4 N_A N_D \\frac{g_A}{g_D} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_A - E_D}{k_B T}\\right)} \\right] \\right\\}$$\nThis expression is dimensionally consistent and analytically derived from first principles under the stated approximations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E_D + k_B T \\ln\\left\\{ \\frac{g_D}{2N_A} \\left[ (N_D - N_A) + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4 N_A N_D \\frac{g_A}{g_D} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_A - E_D}{k_B T}\\right)} \\right] \\right\\}}$$", "id": "2485360"}]}
