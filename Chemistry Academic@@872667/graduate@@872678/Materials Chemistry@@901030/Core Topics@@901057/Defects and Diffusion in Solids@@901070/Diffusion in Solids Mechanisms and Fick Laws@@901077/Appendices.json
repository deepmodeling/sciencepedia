Let the spatial coordinate be $x$, with $x=0$ at the left external surface, the interface at $x=L_1$, and the right external surface at $x=L_1+L_2$. The left layer, $0 \\le x \\le L_1$, has thickness $L_1$ and constant diffusion coefficient $D_1$. The right layer, $L_1 \\le x \\le L_1+L_2$, has thickness $L_2$ and constant diffusion coefficient $D_2$.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and boundary conditions for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The parameters are physically realistic and dimensionally consistent. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete, contradictory, or ambiguous.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with Fick's first law of diffusion in one dimension, which relates the diffusion flux $J$ to the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$:\n$$\nJ = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the system is at steady state. For one-dimensional diffusion, the continuity equation, or Fick's second law, is $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x}$. At steady state, the concentration at any point does not change with time, so $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$. This implies that $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0$, which means the flux $J$ must be constant throughout the entire diffusion couple. This is a critical consequence of the steady-state condition and is also stated as a premise in the problem.\n\nLet the flux through the bilayer be the constant $J$. We apply Fick's first law to each layer separately.\n\nFor the first layer ($0 \\le x \\le L_1$), the diffusion coefficient is $D_1$. The equation for the flux is:\n$$\nJ = -D_1 \\frac{dC_1}{dx}\n$$\nSince $J$ and $D_1$ are constants, the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC_1}{dx}$ must also be constant. This means the concentration profile $C_1(x)$ is linear. We can integrate this equation across the first layer, from $x=0$ to $x=L_1$. Let the concentration at the interface $x=L_1$ be $C_I$. The boundary condition at the left surface is $C_1(0)=C_A$.\n$$\n\\int_{C_A}^{C_I} dC_1 = -\\frac{J}{D_1} \\int_{0}^{L_1} dx\n$$\n$$\nC_I - C_A = -\\frac{J L_1}{D_1}\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives the concentration drop across the first layer:\n$$\nC_A - C_I = \\frac{J L_1}{D_1} \\quad (1)\n$$\n\nFor the second layer ($L_1 \\le x \\le L_1+L_2$), the diffusion coefficient is $D_2$. The flux $J$ is the same.\n$$\nJ = -D_2 \\frac{dC_2}{dx}\n$$\nSimilarly, the concentration profile $C_2(x)$ is linear. We integrate across the second layer, from $x=L_1$ to $x=L_1+L_2$. The concentration is continuous at the interface, so $C_2(L_1)=C_I$. The boundary condition at the right surface is $C_2(L_1+L_2)=C_B$.\n$$\n\\int_{C_I}^{C_B} dC_2 = -\\frac{J}{D_2} \\int_{L_1}^{L_1+L_2} dx\n$$\n$$\nC_B - C_I = -\\frac{J}{D_2} ((L_1+L_2) - L_1) = -\\frac{J L_2}{D_2}\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives the concentration drop across the second layer:\n$$\nC_I - C_B = \\frac{J L_2}{D_2} \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations, (1) and (2), with two unknowns: the interface concentration $C_I$ and the flux $J$.

The frequencies are given in THz, where $1 \\ \\text{THz} = 10^{12} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nLet us calculate the attempt frequency $\\nu_0$:\n$$ \\nu_0 = \\frac{(8.0 \\times 10^{12} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (6.0 \\times 10^{12} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{12} \\ \\text{s}^{-1})}{(7.0 \\times 10^{12} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{12} \\ \\text{s}^{-1})} = \\frac{192}{35} \\times 10^{12} \\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nNow, we compute $D_0^{\\mathrm{th}}$ using $f=1$ and $z=6$:\n$$ D_0^{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{1}{6}(1)(6)(2.50 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m})^2 \\left(\\frac{192}{35} \\times 10^{12} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}\\right) $$\n$$ D_0^{\\mathrm{th}} = (6.25 \\times 10^{-20} \\ \\text{m}^2) \\left(\\frac{192}{35} \\times 10^{12} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}\\right) = \\frac{6.25 \\times 192}{35} \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\text{m}^2\\text{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ D_0^{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{1200}{35} \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\text{m}^2\\text{s}^{-1} = \\frac{240}{7} \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\text{m}^2\\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as:\n$$ R = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{th}}(1000 \\ \\mathrm{K})}{D_{\\mathrm{exp}}(1000 \\ \\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{D_0^{\\mathrm{th}} \\exp(-E_{\\mathrm{th}}/(k_B T))}{D_0^{\\mathrm{exp}} \\exp(-E_{\\mathrm{exp}}/(k_B T))} = \\frac{D_0^{\\mathrm{th}}}{D_0^{\\mathrm{exp}}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{exp}} - E_{\\mathrm{th}}}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nWe substitute the numerical values with $T=1000 \\ \\text{K}$. The ratio of the pre-exponential factors is:\n$$ \\frac{D_0^{\\mathrm{th}}}{D_0^{\\mathrm{exp}}} = \\frac{\\frac{240}{7} \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1}}{2.50 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{24/7 \\times 10^{-7}}{2.50 \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{24}{7 \\times 2.50} = \\frac{24}{17.5} = \\frac{48}{35} $$\nThe argument of the exponential is:\n$$ \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{exp}} - E_{\\mathrm{th}}}{k_B T} = \\frac{0.370 \\ \\text{eV} - 0.350 \\ \\text{eV}}{(8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{eV K}^{-1})(1000 \\ \\text{K})} = \\frac{0.020}{0.08617} $$\nCombining these results, we find the value of $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{48}{35} \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.020}{0.08617}\\right) $$\nEvaluating this expression numerically:\n$$ R \\approx 1.37142857 \\times \\exp(0.2320993385) \\approx 1.37142857 \\times 1.2612457 \\approx 1.729738 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested, gives $R = 1.73$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.73}$$", "id": "2481362"}]}
