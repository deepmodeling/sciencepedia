The problem instructs us to linearize the model by defining two new variables:\n$$ x_i = c_i^n $$\n$$ y_i = \\sigma_{y,i} - \\sigma_0 = \\Delta \\sigma_i $$\nWith these transformations, the model becomes a linear relationship that passes through the origin:\n$$ y_i = A x_i $$\nWe are given a set of $N$ data points $(c_i, \\sigma_{y,i})$, which we transform into a set of points $(x_i, y_i)$. To find the best estimate for the slope $A$, denoted $\\hat{A}$, we must minimize the sum of squared residuals, $S(A)$:\n$$ S(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - A x_i)^2 $$\nTo find the minimum, we take the derivative of $S(A)$ with respect to $A$ and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dA} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{d}{dA} (y_i - A x_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2(y_i - A x_i)(-x_i) = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i x_i - A x_i^2) = 0 $$\nSolving for $A$ gives the least-squares estimator $\\hat{A}$:\n$$ \\hat{A} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i x_i $$\n$$ \\hat{A} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2} $$\nOnce $\\hat{A}$ is calculated from the data, we can solve for the misfit parameter $\\delta$. From the definition $\\hat{A} = M \\kappa G \\hat{\\delta}^p$, we have:\n$$ \\hat{\\delta}^p = \\frac{\\hat{A}}{M \\kappa G} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\delta} = \\left( \\frac{\\hat{A}}{M \\kappa G} \\right)^{1/p} $$\nWe now apply this procedure to each of the three test cases.\n\nCase 1: Fleischer Regime\nParameters: $p = 3/2$, $n = 1/2$, $\\kappa = \\alpha = 0.04$, $\\sigma_0 = 70.0 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}$, $M = 3.06$, $G = 48000 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}$.\nData:\n$c = [0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04]$\n$\\sigma_y = [74.946, 76.369, 79.392, 80.982, 83.137] \\, \\mathrm{MPa}$\n\nFirst, we compute the transformed variables $x_i = c_i^{1/2}$ and $y_i = \\sigma_{y,i} - \\sigma_0$.\n$y = [4.946, 6.369, 9.392, 10.982, 13.137]$\n$x = [0.0707107, 0.1, 0.1414214, 0.1732051, 0.2]$\n\nNext, we calculate the sums required for $\\hat{A}$:\n$\\sum y_i x_i = (4.946)(0.0707107) + (6.369)(0.1) + (9.392)(0.1414214) + (10.982)(0.1732051) + (13.137)(0.2) \\approx 6.84435$\n$\\sum x_i^2 = (0.0707107)^2 + (0.1)^2 + (0.1414214)^2 + (0.1732051)^2 + (0.2)^2 = 0.005 + 0.01 + 0.02 + 0.03 + 0.04 = 0.105$\nSo, $\\hat{A} = \\frac{6.84435}{0.105} \\approx 65.18428$.\n\nNow, we solve for $\\hat{\\delta}$:\n$M \\kappa G = (3.06)(0.04)(48000) = 5875.2$\n$\\hat{\\delta} = \\left( \\frac{65.18428}{5875.2} \\right)^{1/(3/2)} = \\left( 0.0110946... \\right)^{2/3} \\approx 0.050000$\n\nCase 2: Labusch Regime\nParameters: $p = 4/3$, $n = 2/3$, $\\kappa = \\beta = 0.08$, $\\sigma_0 = 15.0 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}$, $M = 3.06$, $G = 26000 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}$.\nData:\n$c = [0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16]$\n$\\sigma_y = [25.58, 33.05, 42.7, 51.9, 59.5] \\, \\mathrm{MPa}$\n\nTransformed variables $x_i = c_i^{2/3}$ and $y_i = \\sigma_{y,i} - \\sigma_0$:\n$y = [10.58, 18.05, 27.7, 36.9, 44.5]$\n$x = [0.0736806, 0.1169608, 0.1856636, 0.2433534, 0.2972288]$\n\nCalculate sums:\n$\\sum y_i x_i \\approx 30.2413$\n$\\sum x_i^2 \\approx 0.201108$\nSo, $\\hat{A} = \\frac{30.2413}{0.201108} \\approx 150.3635$.\n\nSolve for $\\hat{\\delta}$:\n$M \\kappa G = (3.06)(0.08)(26000) = 6364.8$\n$\\hat{\\delta} = \\left( \\frac{150.3635}{6364.8} \\right)^{1/(4/3)} = \\left( 0.023624... \\right)^{3/4} \\approx 0.067961$\n\nCase 3: Fleischer Regime\nParameters: $p = 3/2$, $n = 1/2$, $\\kappa = \\alpha = 0.03$, $\\sigma_0 = 120.0 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}$, $M = 3.06$, $G = 76000 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}$.\nData:\n$c = [0.0, 0.002, 0.005, 0.008]$\n$\\sigma_y = [120.0, 122.593, 123.846, 125.193] \\, \\mathrm{MPa}$\n\nThe first data point $(c_1=0.0, \\sigma_{y,1}=120.0)$ corresponds to $(x_1=0, y_1=0)$ in the transformed coordinates.
