In the paramagnetic high-temperature ($\\mu_{0} H \\ll k_{B} T$) limit, the effective magnetic moment $\\mu_{\\text{eff}}$ of an ensemble of noninteracting ions is defined by the Curie law through the Curie constant $C$ for molar susceptibility $\\chi_{m}$ as $\\chi_{m} = C/T$ and $C \\propto \\mu_{\\text{eff}}^{2}$. Starting only from: (i) the definition of the spin magnetic moment operator $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{s} = - g \\mu_{B} \\mathbf{S}/\\hbar$ for an ion with total spin $\\mathbf{S}$ and spectroscopic splitting factor $g$, (ii) the Boltzmann distribution over Zeeman levels, and (iii) the high-temperature expansion of the Brillouin function, derive the spin-only expression for $\\mu_{\\text{eff}}$ for a paramagnet with total spin quantum number $S$ and then evaluate it for a high-spin $d^{5}$ octahedral ion.

Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires a three-part response: first, the derivation of the spin-only formula for the effective magnetic moment, $\\mu_{\\text{eff}}$; second, the application of this formula to a high-spin $d^5$ octahedral ion; and third, a justification for the quenching of orbital angular momentum in this specific case.\n\nThe analysis begins with an ensemble of non-interacting ions in a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$, which we align with the $z$-axis, so $\\mathbf{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The interaction of an ion's spin magnetic moment with this field is described by the Zeeman Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_{Z}$. Given the spin magnetic moment operator $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{s} = - g \\mu_{B} \\mathbf{S}/\\hbar$, the Hamiltonian becomes:\n$$ \\hat{H}_{Z} = - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = \\left( \\frac{g \\mu_{B}}{\\hbar} \\mathbf{S} \\right) \\cdot (B\\hat{z}) = \\frac{g \\mu_{B} B}{\\hbar} \\hat{S}_{z} $$\nThe operator $\\hat{S}_{z}$ has eigenvalues $m_S \\hbar$, where $m_S$ ranges from $-S$ to $+S$ in integer steps. Thus, the application of the magnetic field splits the ground state into $2S+1$ Zeeman levels, with energies:\n$$ E_{m_S} = m_S g \\mu_{B} B $$\nAccording to statistical mechanics, the probability of an ion being in a state with energy $E_{m_S}$ is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, $\\exp(-E_{m_S} / (k_B T))$. The thermal average of the $z$-component of the magnetic moment for a single ion, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle$, is then:\n$$ \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_{m_S=-S}^{S} \\mu_{z, m_S} \\exp(-E_{m_S}/(k_B T))}{\\sum_{m_S=-S}^{S} \\exp(-E_{m_S}/(k_B T))} $$\nThe eigenvalues of the moment operator $\\hat{\\mu}_{z} = -g \\mu_B \\hat{S}_z / \\hbar$ are $\\mu_{z, m_S} = -g \\mu_B m_S$. Let $x = g \\mu_{B} B / (k_B T)$. Substituting the expressions for $E_{m_S}$ and $\\mu_{z, m_S}$:\n$$ \\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_{m_S=-S}^{S} (-g \\mu_B m_S) \\exp(-m_S x)}{\\sum_{m_S=-S}^{S} \\exp(-m_S x)} $$\nThis is a standard result from statistical mechanics. The numerator can be expressed as a derivative of the denominator (the partition function $Z$):\n$$ \\sum_{m_S=-S}^{S} (-g \\mu_B m_S) \\exp(-m_S x) = g \\mu_B \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\sum_{m_S=-S}^{S} \\exp(-m_S x) \\right) = g \\mu_B \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial x} $$\nThus, $\\langle \\mu_z \\rangle = \\frac{g \\mu_B}{Z} \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial x}$.

The molar magnetic susceptibility is $\\chi_m = M_m / H = \\mu_0 M_m / B$ (in SI units).\n$$ \\chi_m = \\frac{\\mu_0 N_A g^2 \\mu_B^2 S(S+1)}{3 k_B T} $$\nThis is the Curie Law, $\\chi_m = C/T$, with the Curie constant $C$:\n$$ C = \\frac{\\mu_0 N_A g^2 \\mu_B^2 S(S+1)}{3 k_B} $$\nThe effective magnetic moment $\\mu_{\\text{eff}}$ is defined by equating this quantum-mechanical result to the classical Langevin result for a paramagnetic gas, where $C = \\mu_0 N_A \\mu_{\\text{eff}}^2 / (3 k_B)$. Comparing the two expressions for $C$ gives:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{eff}}^2 = g^2 \\mu_B^2 S(S+1) $$\nTaking the square root yields the spin-only formula for the effective magnetic moment:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{eff}} = g \\mu_B \\sqrt{S(S+1)} $$\nIn units of Bohr magnetons ($\\mu_B$), this is $\\mu_{\\text{eff}}/\\mu_B = g \\sqrt{S(S+1)}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this for a high-spin $d^5$ ion in an octahedral field. \"High-spin\" implies that the crystal field splitting energy is less than the spin-pairing energy, so electrons occupy separate orbitals with parallel spins as much as possible. For a $d^5$ configuration, the five electrons occupy the five available $d$ orbitals ($t_{2g}^3 e_g^2$) singly. There are $n=5$ unpaired electrons. The total spin quantum number is $S = \\sum m_s = 5 \\times (1/2) = 5/2$.\nUsing the given assumption that orbital angular momentum is quenched and $g=2$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{eff}}}{\\mu_B} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2} \\left(\\frac{5}{2} + 1\\right)} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{7}{2}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{35}{4}} = 2 \\frac{\\sqrt{35}}{2} = \\sqrt{35} $$\nThe numerical value, rounded to four significant figures, is:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{eff}}}{\\mu_B} \\approx 5.916 $$\n\nFinally, we must justify why first-order orbital contributions to the magnetic moment are minimal for this system. The existence of orbital angular momentum requires that an electron can be transformed into an energetically equivalent, degenerate orbital via rotation. In an octahedral field, the $t_{2g}$ orbitals ($d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$) possess this property, while the $e_g$ orbitals ($d_{z^2}$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$) do not.\nHowever, a more fundamental argument comes from the term symbol of the electronic state. For a free ion with a $d^5$ configuration, Hund's rules dictate a ground state with maximum spin multiplicity, $S = 5/2$, giving a sextet ($2S+1=6$). To achieve this, the five electrons must have quantum numbers $m_l = +2, +1, 0, -1, -2$. The total orbital angular momentum is $L = \\sum m_l = 2+1+0-1-2=0$. This corresponds to an $^6S$ term. An $S$ term is orbitally non-degenerate.\nWhen this ion is placed in an octahedral crystal field, the $^6S$ term is not split by the field because it lacks orbital degeneracy. In the language of group theory, it transforms as the totally symmetric representation, $A_{1g}$. The ground state of the complex is therefore designated as $^6A_{1g}$.\nFirst-order orbital contributions to the magnetic moment, as well as contributions from spin-orbit coupling, arise from the mixing of the ground state with excited states. This mixing is governed by matrix elements of the form $\\langle \\Psi_k | \\hat{O} | \\Psi_0 \\rangle$, where $\\Psi_0$ is the ground state, $\\Psi_k$ is an excited state, and $\\hat{O}$ is an operator such as the orbital angular momentum operator $\\hat{\\mathbf{L}}$. A fundamental selection rule is that for this matrix element to be non-zero, the spin quantum number of $\\Psi_k$ and $\\Psi_0$ must be the same (i.e., $\\Delta S=0$).\nFor a $d^5$ ion, all excited electronic states that can be formed by rearranging electrons within the $d$ orbitals necessarily involve electron pairing and thus have a lower spin multiplicity (e.g., quartets, $S=3/2$, or doublets, $S=1/2$). There are no excited sextet states. Since the ground state is a sextet, and all accessible excited states are quartets or doublets, the selection rule $\\Delta S = 0$ is violated for all possible mixings. Consequently, there is no mixing between the $^6A_{1g}$ ground state and any excited state. This completely forbids any first-order orbital contribution to the magnetic moment. The orbital angular momentum is said to be fully quenched. This is why the spin-only formula is exceptionally accurate for high-spin $d^5$ systems like those containing Mn$^{2+}$ or Fe$^{3+}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.916}$$", "id": "2504916"}, {"introduction": "Bridging the gap between theoretical models and laboratory measurements is a crucial skill for any materials chemist.

Thus, $B_k \\approx \\mu_0 H_k$.\n$$\nM_{m,k} = \\frac{N_A \\mu_0 \\mu_B^2 g_k^2 H_k}{4 k_B T}\n$$\nThe principal components of the molar susceptibility are therefore:\n$$\n\\chi_{m,k} = \\frac{M_{m,k}}{H_k} = \\frac{N_A \\mu_0 \\mu_B^2 g_k^2}{4 k_B T}\n$$\nCurie's Law states that $\\chi_m = C/T$. By comparing this with our derived expression, we identify the principal molar Curie constants $C_k$ as:\n$$\nC_k = \\frac{N_A \\mu_0 \\mu_B^2 g_k^2}{4 k_B}\n$$\nWe first compute the constant prefactor using the provided values:\n$$\nK_C = \\frac{N_A \\mu_0 \\mu_B^2}{4 k_B} = \\frac{(6.02214076\\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}) (4\\pi\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{N\\,A^{-2}}) (9.2740100783\\times 10^{-24}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,T^{-1}})^2}{4 (1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}})}\n$$\n$K_C \\approx 1.17855 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}\\,K}$.\n\nUsing this prefactor and the given g-factors ($g_x = 2.05$, $g_y = 2.07$, $g_z = 2.28$), we calculate the principal Curie constants:\n$$\nC_x = K_C \\cdot g_x^2 = (1.17855 \\times 10^{-6}) \\cdot (2.05)^2 = 4.9532 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}\\,K}\n$$\n$$\nC_y = K_C \\cdot g_y^2 = (1.17855 \\times 10^{-6}) \\cdot (2.07)^2 = 5.0499 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}\\,K}\n$$\n$$\nC_z = K_C \\cdot g_z^2 = (1.17855 \\times 10^{-6}) \\cdot (2.28)^2 = 6.1264 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}\\,K}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the orientational powder average, $C_{\\mathrm{powder}}$. This corresponds to the isotropic average of the susceptibility tensor. The powder-averaged susceptibility is $\\chi_{\\mathrm{powder}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\text{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\chi}) = \\frac{1}{3}(\\chi_x+\\chi_y+\\chi_z)$. Consequently, the powder-averaged Curie constant is the arithmetic mean of the principal constants:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{powder}} = \\frac{C_x + C_y + C_z}{3}\n$$\nAlternatively, this can be derived by averaging the square of the effective g-factor, $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}^2 = g_x^2 \\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2\\phi + g_y^2 \\sin^2\\theta\\sin^2\\phi + g_z^2 \\cos^2\\theta$, over the solid angle:\n$$\n\\langle g_{\\mathrm{eff}}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi} g_{\\mathrm{eff}}^2 \\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta\\,d\\phi = \\frac{g_x^2 + g_y^2 + g_z^2}{3}\n$$\nThis leads to the same result for $C_{\\mathrm{powder}}$. Using the calculated values for $C_x$, $C_y$, and $C_z$:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{powder}} = \\frac{(4.9532 + 5.0499 + 6.1264) \\times 10^{-6}}{3} = \\frac{1.61295 \\times 10^{-5}}{3} = 5.3765 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}\\,K}\n$$\nRounding the final results to four significant figures as requested:\n$C_x = 4.953 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}\\,K}$\n$C_y = 5.050 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}\\,K}$\n$C_z = 6.126 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}\\,K}$\n$C_{\\mathrm{powder}} = 5.377 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}\\,K}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4.953 \\times 10^{-6}  5.050 \\times 10^{-6}  6.126 \\times 10^{-6}  5.377 \\times 10^{-6}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2504862"}]}
