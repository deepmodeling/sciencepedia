From this, the reflection conditions for non-zero X-ray scattering intensity must be determined. The final answer must be a single expression incorporating these conditions.\n\nThe problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is a standard, fundamental exercise in solid-state physics and crystallography.\n\nThe structure factor, $F_{hkl}$, for a set of Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ is defined as the Fourier transform of the electron density distribution within a single unit cell. For a crystal with a basis of $N$ atoms, this can be expressed as a discrete sum over the atoms in the basis:\n$$\nF_{hkl} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} f_j \\exp[2 \\pi i (h x_j + k y_j + l z_j)]\n$$\nIn this expression:\n- $j$ is the index of an atom in the basis, from $1$ to $N$.\n- $f_j$ is the atomic scattering factor of the $j$-th atom. This factor depends on the element and the scattering vector magnitude, but for a given reflection $(h,k,l)$, it is treated as a specific value. The problem states to use an isotropic atomic scattering factor $f$.\n- $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$ are the fractional coordinates of the $j$-th atom within the unit cell, referenced to the unit cell vectors.\n- $(h,k,l)$ are the integer Miller indices defining the specific Bragg reflection.\n- $i$ is the imaginary unit, $i^2 = -1$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the crystal possesses a primitive simple cubic lattice with a one-atom basis. The specifics are:\n1.  The number of atoms in the basis is $N=1$.\n2.  The single atom in the basis has an atomic scattering factor denoted by $f$. Thus, $f_1 = f$.\n3.  The atom is located at the origin of the unit cell, meaning its fractional coordinates are $(x_1, y_1, z_1) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\nSubstituting these specific conditions into the general formula for the structure factor, the sum over $j$ reduces to a single term for $j=1$:\n$$\nF_{hkl} = f_1 \\exp[2 \\pi i (h x_1 + k y_1 + l z_1)]\n$$\nPlacing the values for the coordinates and scattering factor:\n$$\nF_{hkl} = f \\exp[2 \\pi i (h \\cdot 0 + k \\cdot 0 + l \\cdot 0)]\n$$\nThis simplifies the exponent:\n$$\nF_{hkl} = f \\exp[2 \\pi i (0)] = f \\exp(0)\n$$\nSince for any number $z$, $\\exp(0) = 1$, the expression for the structure factor becomes:\n$$\nF_{hkl} = f\n$$\nThis result is valid for any integer triplet $(h,k,l)$.\n\nNext, we must determine the condition for which the kinematic Bragg intensity is nonzero. The scattered intensity $I_{hkl}$ for a given reflection $(h,k,l)$ is proportional to the squared magnitude of the structure factor:\n$$\nI_{hkl} \\propto |F_{hkl}|^2\n$$\nFor the intensity to be nonzero, it is required that $|F_{hkl}|^2 \\neq 0$, which implies that $F_{hkl} \\neq 0$.\n\nIn our case, $F_{hkl} = f$. The atomic scattering factor $f$ is a function of the scattering angle and atomic number, but it is fundamentally nonzero for any physically realistic scattering condition (i.e., for any finite scattering vector). Therefore, $F_{hkl}$ is nonzero for all possible integer values of $h$, $k$, and $l$.\n\nThis means there are no systematic absences for a primitive simple cubic lattice. All reflections defined by any integer triplet $(h,k,l)$ are allowed.\n\nThe final task is to construct a single closed-form expression that gives the value of $F_{hkl}$ for allowed reflections and is zero for forbidden reflections. Since there are no forbidden reflections, the \"indicator function\" for the reflection condition is identically equal to $1$ for all integer triplets $(h,k,l)$. The expression is therefore the product of the structure factor value, $f$, and this indicator, $1$.
