The instrument operates based on the principle of quantum tunneling of electrons between a sharp metallic tip and a conductive sample.

For the STM to function, a small, stable tunneling current, $I_T$, must flow from the microscope's tip to the graphene sheet. This influx of charge must be balanced by an equal outflow of current from the graphene to the ground.\n\nIn this configuration, the injected electrons spread out laterally within the conductive graphene sheet and simultaneously leak vertically through the resistive $\\text{SiO}_2$ substrate to the grounded back-gate. The interplay between the lateral conduction within the graphene and the vertical leakage through the substrate defines a characteristic 'charge relaxation length', $\\lambda$.
