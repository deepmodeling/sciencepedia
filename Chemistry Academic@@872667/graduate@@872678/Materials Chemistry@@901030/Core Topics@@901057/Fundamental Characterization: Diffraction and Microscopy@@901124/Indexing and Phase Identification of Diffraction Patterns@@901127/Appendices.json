It is based on the fundamental principles of X-ray crystallography, namely Bragg's law and the geometry of cubic lattices. The provided data are complete and consistent, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution when physical context is considered. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part calculation and a theoretical explanation. First, the interplanar spacings $d_i$ for the four observed diffraction peaks are computed. Second, the crystal structure is identified as either primitive cubic (P) or body-centered cubic (BCC) by indexing the pattern. Third, the lattice parameter $a$ is calculated from the indexed peaks. Finally, a first-principles explanation of the indexing convention concerning the diffraction order $n$ is required.\n\nStep 1: Computation of Interplanar Spacings $d_i$\n\nBragg's law describes the condition for constructive interference of X-rays scattered by crystal planes:\n$$n\\lambda = 2d\\sin\\theta$$\nwhere $n$ is the diffraction order (an integer), $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incident X-rays, $d$ is the interplanar spacing, and $\\theta$ is the scattering angle.\nThe problem states to assume first-order diffraction, so $n=1$. The wavelength is given as $\\lambda = 1.5406$ Å. The law simplifies to $\\lambda = 2d\\sin\\theta$. We can solve for the interplanar spacing $d$:\n$$d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sin\\theta}$$\nThe experimental data are given as $2\\theta$ values. We must first find $\\theta$ for each peak.\n\nPeak 1: $2\\theta_1 = 44.54^{\\circ} \\implies \\theta_1 = 22.27^{\\circ}$\n$$d_1 = \\frac{1.5406}{2\\sin(22.27^{\\circ})} \\approx 2.0324 \\text{ Å}$$\n\nPeak 2: $2\\theta_2 = 64.67^{\\circ} \\implies \\theta_2 = 32.335^{\\circ}$\n$$d_2 = \\frac{1.5406}{2\\sin(32.335^{\\circ})} \\approx 1.4400 \\text{ Å}$$\n\nPeak 3: $2\\theta_3 = 82.00^{\\circ} \\implies \\theta_3 = 41.00^{\\circ}$\n$$d_3 = \\frac{1.5406}{2\\sin(41.00^{\\circ})} \\approx 1.1741 \\text{ Å}$$\n\nPeak 4: $2\\theta_4 = 98.60^{\\circ} \\implies \\theta_4 = 49.30^{\\circ}$\n$$d_4 = \\frac{1.5406}{2\\sin(49.30^{\\circ})} \\approx 1.0161 \\text{ Å}$$\n\nStep 2: Indexing and Structure Determination\n\nFor a cubic crystal system, the interplanar spacing $d_{hkl}$ for a set of planes with Miller indices $\\{hkl\\}$ is related to the lattice parameter $a$ by:\n$$d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}}$$\nCombining this with Bragg's law (for $n=1$):\n$$\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sin\\theta_{hkl}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}}$$\nSquaring and rearranging gives a linear relationship between $\\sin^2\\theta$ and the sum of squared indices:\n$$\\sin^2\\theta_{hkl} = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{4a^2}(h^2+k^2+l^2)$$\nSince $\\frac{\\lambda^2}{4a^2}$ is a constant for a given experiment on a specific crystal, the values of $\\sin^2\\theta_i$ for the observed peaks must be proportional to the values of $S_i = h_i^2+k_i^2+l_i^2$, which are integers.\nAlternatively, we can analyze the ratio of $1/d_i^2$:\n$$\\frac{1}{d_i^2} = \\frac{1}{a^2}(h_i^2+k_i^2+l_i^2)$$\nLet's compute $1/d_i^2$ for our four peaks:\n$1/d_1^2 \\approx 1/(2.0324)^2 \\approx 0.2421$ Å$^{-2}$\n$1/d_2^2 \\approx 1/(1.4400)^2 \\approx 0.4823$ Å$^{-2}$\n$1/d_3^2 \\approx 1/(1.1741)^2 \\approx 0.7251$ Å$^{-2}$\n$1/d_4^2 \\approx 1/(1.0161)^2 \\approx 0.9680$ Å$^{-2}$\n\nTo find the integer relationship, we divide each value by the smallest value, $0.2421$:\nRatio 1: $0.2421 / 0.2421 = 1.000$\nRatio 2: $0.4823 / 0.2421 \\approx 1.992 \\approx 2$\nRatio 3: $0.7251 / 0.2421 \\approx 2.995 \\approx 3$\nRatio 4: $0.9680 / 0.2421 \\approx 3.998 \\approx 4$\nThe ratios of the quantities $(h^2+k^2+l^2)$ for the four peaks are $1:2:3:4$.\n\nNow we must compare this sequence with the allowed reflections for Primitive Cubic (P) and Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattices.\n- For a P-cubic lattice, all $\\{hkl\\}$ reflections are allowed. The possible values for $S=h^2+k^2+l^2$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, ...$ (note that $S=7$ cannot be formed by the sum of three integer squares). The expected ratio sequence for the first few peaks is $1:2:3:4:5:6:8$. Our observed ratio $1:2:3:4$ is consistent with the start of this sequence.\n- For a BCC lattice, reflections are only allowed when the sum $h+k+l$ is an even number. The allowed values for $S=h^2+k^2+l^2$ are:\n  - $\\{110\\}: S = 1^2+1^2+0^2 = 2$\n  - $\\{200\\}: S = 2^2+0^2+0^2 = 4$\n  - $\\{211\\}: S = 2^2+1^2+1^2 = 6$\n  - $\\{220\\}: S = 2^2+2^2+0^2 = 8$\n  - ...and so on. The sequence of allowed $S$ values is $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...$. The ratio of these values is $1:2:3:4:5...$. Our observed ratio $1:2:3:4$ is also consistent with the start of this sequence.\n\nThe experimental data are mathematically consistent with both hypotheses. However, the problem is one of physical science, not pure mathematics. Primitive cubic crystal structures are extremely rare in elements, with polonium being the only known example under standard conditions. Body-centered cubic structures, on the other hand, are very common (e.g., Fe, Cr, Mo, W). The calculated lattice parameter for the BCC hypothesis ($a \\approx 2.87$ Å) is characteristic of many common metals, such as $\\alpha$-iron ($a=2.8665$ Å). The P-cubic hypothesis yields a much smaller lattice parameter ($a \\approx 2.03$ Å), which is less physically plausible for a metallic element. Therefore, based on physical and chemical reasoning, the BCC indexing is the correct choice.\n\nThe Miller indices $\\{hkl\\}$ are assigned based on the sequence $S = 2, 4, 6, 8$:\n- Peak 1 ($S=2$): $\\{110\\}$\n- Peak 2 ($S=4$): $\\{200\\}$\n- Peak 3 ($S=6$): $\\{211\\}$\n- Peak 4 ($S=8$): $\\{220\\}$\n\nStep 3: Calculation of Lattice Parameter $a$\n\nWe compute the lattice parameter $a_i$ from each diffraction line using the formula $a_i = d_i \\sqrt{h_i^2+k_i^2+l_i^2}$. Using the more precise values for $d_i$:\n$a_1 = d_1 \\sqrt{2} = 2.03236 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.8742$ Å\n$a_2 = d_2 \\sqrt{4} = 1.43999 \\times 2 \\approx 2.8800$ Å\n$a_3 = d_3 \\sqrt{6} = 1.17414 \\times \\sqrt{6} \\approx 2.8761$ Å\n$a_4 = d_4 \\sqrt{8} = 1.01605 \\times \\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.8738$ Å\n\nThe best estimate for $a$ is the arithmetic mean of these four values:\n$$\\bar{a} = \\frac{a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4}{4} = \\frac{2.8742 + 2.8800 + 2.8761 + 2.8738}{4} = \\frac{11.5041}{4} \\approx 2.876025 \\text{ Å}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the lattice parameter is $a = 2.876$ Å.\n\nExplanation of the role of $n$ in Bragg's Law and Indexing\n\nBragg's law is $n\\lambda = 2d_{hkl}\\sin\\theta$. A diffraction peak can be described by a combination of the Miller indices $\\{hkl\\}$ of a family of crystal planes and the integer order of diffraction $n$. For a cubic crystal, substituting $d_{hkl} = a/\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}$ gives:\n$$n\\lambda = 2 \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}} \\sin\\theta$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\\lambda = 2 \\left( \\frac{a}{n\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}} \\right) \\sin\\theta$$\nLet us define a new set of Miller indices $\\{h'k'l'\\} = \\{nh, nk, nl\\}$. The interplanar spacing for these hypothetical planes would be:\n$$d_{h'k'l'} = d_{nh,nk,nl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{(nh)^2+(nk)^2+(nl)^2}} = \\frac{a}{n\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}} = \\frac{d_{hkl}}{n}$$\nSubstituting this into the rewritten Bragg's law yields:\n$$\\lambda = 2 d_{h'k'l'} \\sin\\theta$$\nThis equation is mathematically identical to a first-order ($n=1$) reflection from a set of planes with Miller indices $\\{h'k'l'\\} = \\{nh, nk, nl\\}$.\n\nThis means that an $n$-th order reflection from the $\\{hkl\\}$ planes is experimentally indistinguishable from a first-order reflection from the $\\{nh, nk, nl\\}$ planes, as both occur at the same scattering angle $\\theta$. For example, the second-order reflection from the $(100)$ plane ($n=2, \\{hkl\\}=\\{100\\}$) appears at the exact same position as the first-order reflection from the $(200)$ plane ($n=1, \\{hkl\\}=\\{200\\}$).\n\nIf one were to allow $n>1$ as an independent variable during indexing, any given diffraction peak at angle $\\theta$ could be assigned an infinite number of possible $(n, \\{hkl\\})$ combinations, resulting in a completely ambiguous and ill-posed problem. To resolve this, the standard crystallographic convention is to *always* assume first-order diffraction ($n=1$). The Miller indices $\\{hkl\\}$ assigned to a peak are then understood to be the set $\\{nh_0, nk_0, nl_0\\}$, where $\\{h_0k_0l_0\\}$ are the fundamental indices (the simplest integers representing the plane orientation) and $n$ is the diffraction order, which has been absorbed into the indices. This convention renders the indexing procedure unique and systematic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.876}$$", "id": "2492901"}, {"introduction": "While peak positions reveal the geometry of the unit cell, their intensities tell a deeper story about the arrangement of atoms within it.

This term is non-zero only if the Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ are all even or all odd (unmixed parity). In these cases, the sums $h+k$, $h+l$, and $k+l$ are all even, causing each exponential term to be $1$, and the lattice factor evaluates to $1+1+1+1=4$.

This is linear in parameters $\\alpha=(2\\pi)^2/a^2$ and the ratios $r_1=\\beta/\\alpha = a^2/b^2$, $r_2=\\gamma/\\alpha = a^2/c^2$, with regressor $x_{hkl} = h^2 + r_1 k^2 + r_2 l^2$.\n- Uncertainty propagation from $d_i$ to $Q_i$ follows from $Q_i = (2\\pi)^2 d_i^{-2}$, giving $\\sigma_{Q,i} = \\left| \\frac{dQ}{dd} \\right| \\sigma_{d,i} = 2(2\\pi)^2 \\, d_i^{-3} \\, \\sigma_{d,i}$.\n\nYou must implement the following algorithmic decisions so that your program’s results are deterministic and testable:\n- For each crystal system, generate a candidate ordered list of unique regressor values $x_{hkl}$ from nonnegative Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ with $0 \\le h,k,l \\le H_{\\max}$, excluding the trivial $(0,0,0)$. For this problem, use $H_{\\max} = 6$.\n  - For cubic, use $x_{hkl} = h^2 + k^2 + l^2$.\n  - For tetragonal, for a fixed ratio candidate $r$, use $x_{hkl} = (h^2+k^2) + r\\,l^2$.\n  - For orthorhombic, for fixed ratio candidates $r_1,r_2$, use $x_{hkl} = h^2 + r_1 k^2 + r_2 l^2$.\n- For each system and each fixed set of ratios, sort the unique $x_{hkl}$ in ascending order and take the first $N$ values, where $N=10$ is the number of observed peaks. These $N$ values are assigned in order to the $N$ observed peaks, which are assumed already sorted by increasing $Q_i$ (equivalently by decreasing $d_i$).\n- Perform weighted least squares through the origin to estimate the scale $\\alpha$ for the chosen regressors $x_i$ and the observed $Q_i$, using weights $w_i = 1/\\sigma_{Q,i}^2$. The weighted least-squares estimator for a zero-intercept model is $\\hat{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i x_i Q_i}{\\sum_i w_i x_i^2}$.\n- Compute the chi-square $ \\chi^2 = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{Q_i - \\hat{\\alpha} x_i}{\\sigma_{Q,i}} \\right)^2 $ and the reduced chi-square $ \\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\chi^2/\\nu$, where the degrees of freedom are $\\nu = N - p$ with $p$ equal to the number of free model parameters: $p = 1$ for cubic, $p = 2$ for tetragonal, $p = 3$ for orthorhombic.\n- For tetragonal, search over the ratio grid $r \\in \\{\\,0.50,\\,0.56,\\,0.5625,\\,0.60,\\,0.70,\\,0.80,\\,1.00,\\,1.50,\\,2.00,\\,3.00\\,\\}$ and keep the minimal $ \\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}}$ across the grid.

It presents a clear, deterministic algorithm for indexing powder X-ray diffraction patterns based on established principles of crystallography and statistical analysis. The problem provides all necessary data, equations, and constraints to arrive at a unique, verifiable solution. We shall now proceed with a complete, reasoned solution following the prescribed methodology.\n\nThe objective is to identify the most probable crystal system (cubic, tetragonal, or orthorhombic) for each of three given datasets by means of a weighted least-squares (WLS) fit. The selection criterion is the minimization of the reduced chi-square, $\\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}}$, a standard measure of goodness-of-fit that accounts for the number of model parameters.\n\nFirst, we transform the experimental data from interplanar spacings, $d_i$, to the momentum-transfer squared variable, $Q_i$. The problem defines this variable as:\n$$ Q_i = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{d_i}\\right)^2 $$\nThe associated uncertainties, $\\sigma_{Q,i}$, are determined using standard error propagation from the uncertainties in the d-spacings, $\\sigma_{d,i}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{Q,i} = \\left| \\frac{dQ_i}{dd_i} \\right| \\sigma_{d,i} = \\left| -2(2\\pi)^2 d_i^{-3} \\right| \\sigma_{d,i} = 2(2\\pi)^2 d_i^{-3} \\sigma_{d,i} $$\nThese uncertainties are used to define the weights for the WLS fit, $w_i = 1/\\sigma_{Q,i}^2$. The data points with smaller uncertainty (i.e., higher precision) will thus have a greater influence on the fit. The input $d_i$ values for each dataset are provided in descending order, which ensures the corresponding $Q_i$ values are in ascending order.\n\nThe core of the analysis lies in modeling the theoretical $Q_{hkl}$ values for each crystal system as a linear function through the origin, $Q_{hkl} = \\alpha x_{hkl}$, where $h,k,l$ are the Miller indices. The parameter $\\alpha$ is a scale factor related to the lattice parameters, and $x_{hkl}$ is a regressor whose form depends on the crystal system.\n\nFor each crystal system and each dataset, the analytical procedure is as follows:\n1.  Generate a set of theoretical regressor values, $x_{hkl}$, using all non-trivial Miller index triplets $(h,k,l)$ where $0 \\le h,k,l \\le H_{\\max}$ with $H_{\\max}=6$.\n2.  Extract the unique values from this set, sort them in ascending order, and take the first $N=10$ values, denoted $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{10}$. These correspond to the $N=10$ observed peaks.\n3.  Perform a WLS fit for the model $Q_i = \\alpha x_i$. The zero-intercept WLS estimator for $\\alpha$ is given by:\n    $$ \\hat{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i x_i Q_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i x_i^2} $$\n4.  Calculate the chi-square statistic, which measures the total squared error between the observed data and the model predictions, weighted by the data uncertainty:\n    $$ \\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{Q_i - \\hat{\\alpha} x_i}{\\sigma_{Q,i}} \\right)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (Q_i - \\hat{\\alpha} x_i)^2 $$\n5.  Calculate the reduced chi-square, $\\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}}$, by normalizing $\\chi^2$ by the number of degrees of freedom, $\\nu = N - p$. Here, $N=10$ is the number of data points and $p$ is the number of free parameters in the underlying physical model.\n    $$ \\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\frac{\\chi^2}{\\nu} = \\frac{\\chi^2}{N-p} $$\n    A $\\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}}$ value close to $1.0$ typically indicates a good fit where the model error is comparable to the experimental error.\n\nWe now detail the process for each of the three crystal systems.\n\n**1. Cubic System ($p=1$)**\nThe model has one parameter, the lattice constant $a$. The relationship is:\n$$ Q_{hkl} = \\frac{(2\\pi)^2}{a^2}(h^2+k^2+l^2) $$\nThis fits the linear form $Q_{hkl} = \\alpha x_{hkl}$ with $\\alpha = (2\\pi)^2/a^2$ and the integer regressor $x_{hkl} = h^2+k^2+l^2$. The number of model parameters is $p=1$. The degrees of freedom are $\\nu = 10 - 1 = 9$. We generate the first $10$ unique, non-zero, sorted values of $h^2+k^2+l^2$ and perform a single WLS fit to find the corresponding $\\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}}$.\n\n**2. Tetragonal System ($p=2$)**\nThe model has two parameters, the lattice constants $a$ and $c$. The relationship is:\n$$ Q_{hkl} = (2\\pi)^2 \\left( \\frac{h^2+k^2}{a^2} + \\frac{l^2}{c^2} \\right) $$\nThis is a linear model in two variables, $(2\\pi)^2/a^2$ and $(2\\pi)^2/c^2$. The problem prescribes a grid search strategy. By defining $\\alpha = (2\\pi)^2/a^2$ and a ratio $r = a^2/c^2$, the equation becomes:\n$$ Q_{hkl} = \\alpha \\left( (h^2+k^2) + r l^2 \\right) $$\nFor a fixed value of $r$ from the specified grid, this is a one-parameter linear model with regressor $x_{hkl}(r) = (h^2+k^2) + r l^2$. For each $r$ in the grid $\\{\\,0.50,\\,0.56,\\,0.5625,\\,0.60,\\,0.70,\\,0.80,\\,1.00,\\,1.50,\\,2.00,\\,3.00\\,\\}$, we compute the first $10$ unique regressors, perform a WLS fit for $\\hat{\\alpha}(r)$, and calculate the resulting $\\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}}(r)$. The number of physical parameters for the tetragonal model is $p=2$, so the degrees of freedom are $\\nu = 10 - 2 = 8$. The final value for the tetragonal system is the minimum $\\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}}$ found across the grid search: $\\min_{r} \\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}}(r)$.\n\n**3. Orthorhombic System ($p=3$)**\nThe model has three parameters, $a$, $b$, and $c$. The relationship is:\n$$ Q_{hkl} = (2\\pi)^2 \\left( \\frac{h^2}{a^2} + \\frac{k^2}{b^2} + \\frac{l^2}{c^2} \\right) $$\nUsing a similar grid search strategy, we define $\\alpha = (2\\pi)^2/a^2$ and ratios $r_1=a^2/b^2$ and $r_2=a^2/c^2$. The model becomes:\n$$ Q_{hkl} = \\alpha ( h^2 + r_1 k^2 + r_2 l^2 ) $$\nWe perform a search over the two-dimensional grid of ratios $r_1 \\in \\{\\,0.50,\\,1.00,\\,1.30,\\,1.34,\\,1.343,\\,1.50,\\,2.00\\,\\}$ and $r_2 \\in \\{\\,0.90,\\,1.30,\\,1.80,\\,2.00,\\,2.007,\\,2.20\\,\\}$. For each pair $(r_1, r_2)$, we generate the regressors $x_{hkl}(r_1,r_2) = h^2 + r_1 k^2 + r_2 l^2$, find $\\hat{\\alpha}(r_1,r_2)$, and compute $\\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}}(r_1,r_2)$. The orthorhombic model has $p=3$ parameters, so the degrees of freedom are $\\nu = 10 - 3 = 7$. The final value is the minimum $\\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}}$ over the entire $(r_1, r_2)$ grid.\n\n**Model Selection**\nFor each dataset, we compare the minimum $\\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}}$ values obtained for the cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic models. The system with the globally minimum $\\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is chosen as the best fit. A tie-breaking rule is specified: if the $\\chi^2_{\\mathrm{red}}$ values for two or more systems are within a tolerance of $10^{-9}$, the system with the fewer number of parameters $p$ (i.e., the simpler model) is selected. This adheres to the principle of parsimony, or Occam's razor. The selected system is then encoded as an integer ($1$ for cubic, $2$ for tetragonal, $3$ for orthorhombic).
