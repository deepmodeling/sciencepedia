The bulk liquid, far from the interface, has a uniform initial solute concentration $C_0$. As the solid phase grows, it rejects solute into the liquid. The degree of this rejection is quantified by the equilibrium partition coefficient, $k$, defined as the ratio of solute concentration in the solid to that in the liquid at the interface. For this particular alloy, $k$ is a constant less than 1.\n\nUnder steady-state conditions, this solute rejection creates a concentration gradient in the liquid ahead of the moving interface. The solute concentration in the liquid, $C_L(x)$, at a distance $x$ from the interface, is given by the following equation:\n$$C_L(x) = C_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{1-k}{k} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R}{D}x\\right)\\right)$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the solute in the liquid.\n\nThe local equilibrium freezing temperature, or liquidus temperature $T_{\\text{liquidus}}(x)$, is a function of the local solute concentration $C_L(x)$. For a stable, planar growth front to be maintained, the actual temperature in the liquid, $T_{\\text{actual}}(x)$, must be greater than or equal to the local liquidus temperature everywhere ahead of the interface (i.e., for all $x > 0$). A violation of this condition leads to morphological instability and the breakdown of the planar interface.\n\nThe actual temperature profile in the liquid is controlled by an externally applied temperature gradient, $G$, and is given by $T_{\\text{actual}}(x) = T_{\\text{interface}} + Gx$, where $T_{\\text{interface}}$ is the temperature at the solid-liquid interface. Under the assumption of local equilibrium at the interface, $T_{\\text{interface}}$ is equal to the liquidus temperature corresponding to the concentration at the interface, $C_L(0)$.\n\nThe relationship between liquidus temperature and solute concentration can be simplified by using the equilibrium freezing range, $\\Delta T_0$. For the bulk alloy composition $C_0$, $\\Delta T_0$ is defined as the difference between its liquidus and solidus temperatures. It is related to the material properties by $\\Delta T_0 = m_L C_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{k} - 1\\right)$, where $m_L$ is the magnitude of the slope of the liquidus line on the phase diagram.
