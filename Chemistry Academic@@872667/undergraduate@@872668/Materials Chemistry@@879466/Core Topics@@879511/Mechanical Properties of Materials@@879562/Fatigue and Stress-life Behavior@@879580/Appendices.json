This problem challenges you to think critically about how different testing setups—specifically rotating-bending versus axial loading—create different stress distributions within a specimen. Understanding these differences is crucial for correctly interpreting experimental data and appreciating the statistical \"stressed volume\" effect, which helps explain why fatigue failure is a weakest-link phenomenon [@problem_id:1299029].", "problem": "In the field of materials science, fatigue testing is crucial for predicting the lifetime of components subjected to cyclic loading. Two common methods for generating Stress-Number of cycles (S-N) data are the rotating-bending test and the fully-reversed axial (push-pull) test. In a rotating-bending test, a cylindrical specimen is mounted as a cantilever beam, loaded at its free end, and rotated about its longitudinal axis. In a fully-reversed axial test, a similar specimen is subjected to a sinusoidal tensile and compressive load along its longitudinal axis.\n\nConsider two identical, homogeneous, cylindrical specimens made from the same metallic alloy. One is tested using a rotating-bending setup, and the other is tested using a fully-reversed axial fatigue machine. In both tests, the maximum tensile stress experienced by the material is set to the same value, $\\sigma_{max}$. Assuming fatigue failure initiates from microscopic, statistically distributed flaws within the material, which of the following statements most accurately contrasts the stress states in the two specimens and predicts the resulting relationship between their S-N curves?\n\nA. In a rotating-bending test, the stress is uniform across the specimen's cross-section, while in an axial test, it is highest at the surface. This causes the rotating-bending test to yield shorter fatigue lives for a given applied stress.\n\nB. Both test types produce an identical stress distribution and therefore yield statistically indistinguishable S-N curves, as long as the maximum applied stress is the same.\n\nC. In an axial test, the stress is uniform over the entire cross-section, whereas in a rotating-bending test, a stress gradient exists, with maximum stress only at the surface. Consequently, for a given maximum stress amplitude, the axial test typically results in a shorter fatigue life.\n\nD. A rotating-bending test involves a stress gradient where the highly stressed surface is supported by a less-stressed core. This mechanical support significantly increases the material's intrinsic fatigue resistance, causing the S-N curve from rotating-bending to always be above the axial test curve.\n\nE. The stress state is identical in both tests, but the rotation in the rotating-bending test introduces additional torsional stresses that are not present in the axial test, leading to a shorter fatigue life.", "solution": "We compare the stress states and their implications for fatigue life, given identical, homogeneous cylindrical specimens and identical maximum tensile stress $\\sigma_{max}$ at the critical location.\n\n1) Fully-reversed axial (push-pull) test:\n- The nominal axial stress is uniform over the cross-section:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{axial}}(r,t) = \\sigma_{a}\\sin(\\omega t), \\quad \\text{independent of } r,\n$$\nso that the entire cross-sectional area is subjected to the same stress amplitude $\\sigma_{a}$, with $\\sigma_{max} = \\sigma_{a}$. The entire gauge volume is therefore highly stressed every cycle.\n\n2) Rotating-bending test:\n- The bending stress in a circular cross-section subjected to a bending moment $M$ varies linearly with radial distance from the neutral axis:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{bend}}(r) = \\frac{M r}{I}, \\quad I = \\frac{\\pi R^{4}}{4},\n$$\nwith maximum at the surface $r=R$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{max} = \\frac{M R}{I}.\n$$\n- As the specimen rotates, a material point at the surface experiences a fully reversed sinusoidal stress of amplitude $\\sigma_{max}$, but the stress amplitude decays toward the center according to\n$$\n\\sigma(r) = \\sigma_{max}\\frac{r}{R}.\n$$\nHence only a surface layer attains $\\sigma_{max}$; the interior experiences smaller amplitudes.\n\n3) Statistical flaw-based fatigue initiation implication:\n- If fatigue initiation is governed by randomly distributed microscopic flaws, the probability of finding a critical flaw increases with the volume (or surface area, for surface-driven initiation) subjected to high stress amplitude. A weakest-link or hazard-type model can be written schematically as\n$$\nP_{\\text{fail}} = 1 - \\exp\\!\\left[-\\int_{V} H\\!\\left(\\sigma(x)\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}V\\right],\n$$\nwhere $H$ increases with local stress amplitude. For the same $\\sigma_{max}$:\n- Axial test: a large volume is at $\\sigma_{a}=\\sigma_{max}$ each cycle, making $\\int_{V} H(\\sigma)\\,\\mathrm{d}V$ larger.\n- Rotating-bending: only a thin surface region is at $\\sigma_{max}$, with most of the cross-section at lower $\\sigma$, making the integral smaller.\n\nTherefore, for a given maximum stress amplitude $\\sigma_{max}$, the axial test generally has a higher initiation probability per cycle and thus a shorter fatigue life than rotating-bending. This directly supports the statement that axial loading is uniform while rotating-bending has a stress gradient with maximum at the surface, and that the axial S-N curve will typically lie below the rotating-bending S-N curve at the same $\\sigma_{max}$.\n\nThis matches option C and rules out the others: A reverses the stress distributions, B ignores the gradient and size effects, D overstates the outcome as \"always\" and misattributes it to an intrinsic resistance increase rather than a stressed-volume effect, and E incorrectly introduces torsion in rotating-bending.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1299029"}, {"introduction": "This practice bridges the gap between fundamental materials science and practical reliability engineering, moving beyond deterministic models to a probabilistic approach. Real-world materials, especially those produced by casting, contain inherent defects like porosity, which act as stress concentrators and fatigue initiation sites.

A well-known challenge with these materials is the significant scatter observed in their Stress-Number of cycles (S-N) fatigue data, which complicates design and life prediction. This scatter is often attributed to the inherent variability of defects, such as gas porosity, introduced during the casting process.\n\nConsider a component made from such a cast aluminum alloy subjected to a fully reversed cyclic stress, where the stress amplitude is denoted by $\\sigma_a$. The stress range is therefore $\\Delta \\sigma = 2\\sigma_a$. Failure is assumed to be dominated by the initiation of a fatigue crack at the largest internal pore.
