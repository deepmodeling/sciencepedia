The apex is always blunted, and its geometry can be accurately modeled as a sphere with a finite radius of curvature, $R$, for indentations shallower than the tip radius.\n\nAn analyst processing the indentation data uses the standard software package, which calculates the hardness by assuming the indenter is a perfect cone. That is, the measured hardness is computed as $H_{meas} = P / A_{ideal}$.
