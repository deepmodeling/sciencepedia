The calculation requires several steps: first, determining the quantum numbers $L$, $S$, and $J$ from the term symbol; second, calculating the Landé g-factor, $g_J$; and finally, calculating $\\mu_{eff}$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the quantum numbers L, S, and J.**\n\nThe ground state term symbol is given in the standard Russell-Saunders format, $^{2S+1}L_J$. For Gd³⁺, the symbol is $^8S_{7/2}$. By comparing the general form with the given symbol, we can extract the quantum numbers.\n\n- The superscript is the spin multiplicity, $2S+1 = 8$. Solving for the total spin quantum number $S$, we get $2S = 7$, which gives $S = \\frac{7}{2}$.\n- The letter code 'S' represents the total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$. The codes S, P, D, F, G, ... correspond to $L = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...$ respectively. Therefore, for an 'S' state, we have $L=0$.\n- The subscript is the total angular momentum quantum number, $J$. From the term symbol, we can directly read $J = \\frac{7}{2}$.\n(As a self-consistency check, the values of $J$ are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series $|L-S| \\le J \\le L+S$. With $L=0$ and $S=7/2$, we have $|0-7/2| \\le J \\le 0+7/2$, which simplifies to $J=7/2$. Our value is consistent.)\n\nSo, we have: $L=0$, $S=7/2$, and $J=7/2$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Landé g-factor ($g_J$).**\n\nThe formula for the Landé g-factor is:\n$$ g_J = 1 + \\frac{J(J+1) + S(S+1) - L(L+1)}{2J(J+1)} $$\nFirst, we calculate the terms involving the quantum numbers:\n- $J(J+1) = \\frac{7}{2} \\left(\\frac{7}{2} + 1\\right) = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{63}{4}$\n- $S(S+1) = \\frac{7}{2} \\left(\\frac{7}{2} + 1\\right) = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{63}{4}$\n- $L(L+1) = 0(0+1) = 0$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula for $g_J$:\n$$ g_J = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{63}{4} + \\frac{63}{4} - 0}{2 \\left(\\frac{63}{4}\\right)} = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{126}{4}}{\\frac{126}{4}} = 1 + 1 = 2 $$\nThe Landé g-factor for the ground state of Gd³⁺ is exactly 2. This is characteristic of any state with zero orbital angular momentum ($L=0$).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the effective magnetic moment ($\\mu_{eff}$).**\n\nThe formula for the effective magnetic moment is:\n$$ \\mu_{eff} = g_J \\sqrt{J(J+1)} \\mu_B $$\nWe have already calculated $g_J=2$ and $J(J+1) = 63/4$. Substituting these values:\n$$ \\mu_{eff} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{63}{4}} \\mu_B $$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$ \\mu_{eff} = 2 \\frac{\\sqrt{63}}{\\sqrt{4}} \\mu_B = 2 \\frac{\\sqrt{63}}{2} \\mu_B = \\sqrt{63} \\mu_B $$\nTo get the numerical value, we compute the square root of 63:\n$$ \\mu_{eff} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 7} \\mu_B = 3\\sqrt{7} \\mu_B $$\nUsing the value $\\sqrt{7} \\approx 2.645751...$:\n$$ \\mu_{eff} \\approx 3 \\times 2.645751... \\mu_B \\approx 7.937253... \\mu_B $$\n\n**Step 4: Round the final answer.**\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\mu_{eff} \\approx 7.937 \\mu_B $$\nThe unit of the answer is Bohr magnetons ($\\mu_B$), so the numerical value to be reported is 7.937.\n\nIt is worth noting that for states with $L=0$, the total angular momentum is purely from spin ($J=S$). The general formula for $\\mu_{eff}$ simplifies to $\\mu_{eff} = 2\\sqrt{S(S+1)}\\mu_B$. The electronic configuration of Gd³⁺ is [Xe] $4f^7$, meaning it has 7 unpaired electrons ($n=7$), so $S=n/2=7/2$.
