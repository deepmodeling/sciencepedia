A real capacitor with a dielectric material can be modeled as an ideal capacitor with capacitance $C_p$ in parallel with a resistor with conductance $G_p = 1/R_p$. The complex admittance of this parallel circuit is $Y^* = G_p + i\\omega C_p$, where $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency.\n\nThe complex capacitance, $C^*$, is related to the complex admittance by $Y^* = i\\omega C^*$.

For a parallel plate capacitor with plate area $A$ and thickness $t$, the complex capacitance is given by:\n$$C^* = \\epsilon^* \\frac{A}{t} = (\\epsilon' - i\\epsilon'') \\frac{A}{t} = \\epsilon' \\frac{A}{t} - i\\epsilon'' \\frac{A}{t}$$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $C^*$, we can match the real and imaginary parts:\nReal part: $C_p = \\epsilon' \\frac{A}{t}$\nImaginary part: $\\frac{G_p}{\\omega} = \\epsilon'' \\frac{A}{t}$\n\nFrom these equations, we can express $\\epsilon'$ and $\\epsilon''$ in terms of the measured and geometric quantities:\n$\\epsilon' = \\frac{C_p t}{A}$\n$\\epsilon'' = \\frac{G_p t}{\\omega A}$\n\nThe problem provides the dissipation factor, $D$, not the conductance $G_p$. The dissipation factor for the parallel model is defined as the ratio of the energy dissipated per cycle to the energy stored per cycle, which is equivalent to the ratio of the current through the resistive path to the current through the capacitive path.\n$$D = \\frac{I_{R_p}}{I_{C_p}} = \\frac{V/R_p}{V/(1/(\\omega C_p))} = \\frac{\\omega C_p}{R_p} = G_p (\\omega C_p)^{-1} = \\frac{G_p}{\\omega C_p}$$\nThis is also known as the loss tangent, $\\tan \\delta$. From this, we find $G_p = D \\omega C_p$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $G_p$ into our equation for $\\epsilon''$:\n$$\\epsilon'' = \\frac{(D \\omega C_p) t}{\\omega A} = \\frac{D C_p t}{A}$$\nNotice that this gives a simple relationship: $\\epsilon'' = D \\epsilon'$.\n\nThe problem asks for the *relative* permittivity components, $\\epsilon_r' = \\epsilon'/\\epsilon_0$ and $\\epsilon_r'' = \\epsilon''/\\epsilon_0$.\n$$\\epsilon_r' = \\frac{\\epsilon'}{\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{C_p t}{\\epsilon_0 A}$$\n$$\\epsilon_r'' = \\frac{\\epsilon''}{\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{D C_p t}{\\epsilon_0 A} = D \\epsilon_r'$$\n\nNow we can substitute the numerical values.
