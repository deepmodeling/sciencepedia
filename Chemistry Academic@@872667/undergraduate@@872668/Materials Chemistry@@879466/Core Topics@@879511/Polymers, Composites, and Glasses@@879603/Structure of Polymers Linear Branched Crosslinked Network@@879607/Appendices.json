Both samples are white powders and are known to be polystyrene. However, one sample is linear polystyrene, consisting of long, individual chains of repeating styrene units. The other sample is a crosslinked polystyrene network, where the polystyrene chains are covalently bonded to each other via divinylbenzene crosslinking agents.\n\nThe student performs a simple solubility test. They place 1 gram of Sample Alpha into a beaker containing 100 mL of toluene (a known good solvent for polystyrene) and 1 gram of Sample Beta into a separate, identical beaker with 100 mL of toluene. Both beakers are sealed and left on a magnetic stirrer for 24 hours at room temperature to ensure maximum interaction with the solvent.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the student observes the contents of the beakers. In the beaker with Sample Alpha, the powder has completely vanished, resulting in a clear, viscous, homogeneous liquid. In the beaker with Sample Beta, the original powder is gone, but it has been replaced by a single, translucent, swollen, gelatinous mass that occupies a significant portion of the beaker's volume.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following conclusions is correct?\n\nA. Sample Alpha is the crosslinked polymer and Sample Beta is the linear polymer.\n\nB. Sample Alpha is the linear polymer and Sample Beta is the crosslinked polymer.\n\nC.

The experiment is inconclusive because temperature also affects solubility.", "solution": "We analyze dissolution and swelling of polymers in solvents using polymer solution thermodynamics.\n\nFor a linear polymer in a good solvent, the Gibbs free energy of mixing is negative, enabling dissolution. Within Flory-Huggins theory, a good solvent satisfies the interaction parameter condition $\\chi < \\frac{1}{2}$, which for polystyrene in toluene at room temperature is well established. A linear polymer has no network elasticity; equivalently, the effective network chain density is $\\nu_{e}=0$. Therefore, there is no elastic restoring force opposing mixing, and the polymer dissolves to form a homogeneous viscous solution. Observation: Sample Alpha disappears and yields a clear, viscous, homogeneous liquid, consistent with complete dissolution of a linear polystyrene in a good solvent.\n\nFor a crosslinked polymer network, the material is insoluble because it forms a single macromolecule of effectively infinite molar mass. The equilibrium state in a good solvent is swelling, governed by Flory-Rehner theory through the balance\n$$\n\\Pi_{\\text{mix}}(\\phi,\\chi) + \\Pi_{\\text{el}}(\\phi,\\nu_{e}) = 0,\n$$\nwhere $\\Pi_{\\text{mix}}$ is the osmotic pressure from mixing (favoring swelling) and $\\Pi_{\\text{el}}$ is the elastic retractive pressure due to the network (opposing swelling), with $\\nu_{e} > 0$. This balance yields a finite swollen gel, not dissolution. Observation: Sample Beta becomes a single translucent, swollen, gelatinous mass occupying significant volume, exactly the behavior of a crosslinked polystyrene network swollen by toluene.\n\nThese observations map directly:\n- Sample Alpha dissolves completely in toluene, indicating a linear polymer in a good solvent.\n- Sample Beta forms a swollen gel, indicating a crosslinked network that is insoluble but swellable.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the dissolving sample (Alpha) cannot be crosslinked.\n- B is correct: Alpha is linear, Beta is crosslinked.\n- C is incorrect: a linear, higher-molar-mass sample in a good solvent would still dissolve (albeit more viscously), not form a single gel piece.\n- D is incorrect: a crosslinked polymer would not fully disappear into a clear homogeneous solution; even at low crosslink density it remains insoluble.\n- E is incorrect: while temperature affects $\\chi$, toluene at room temperature is a known good solvent for polystyrene, and the starkly different outcomes are conclusive.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is that Sample Alpha is the linear polymer and Sample Beta is the crosslinked polymer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1338366"}, {"introduction": "For polymers with the same chemical formula and total mass, how does branching affect their behavior? This exercise delves into Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), a workhorse technique for polymer characterization that separates molecules based on their size in solution. By considering how linear and branched polymers navigate the pores of an SEC column, you will develop an intuition for the concept of hydrodynamic volume and its relationship to molecular architecture [@problem_id:1338387].", "problem": "An analytical chemist is tasked with characterizing two different batches of a polymer, polyisobutylene. The first batch, which will be referred to as Sample L, consists of linear polymer chains. The second batch, Sample B, consists of star-branched polymers, where each polymer molecule is composed of several chains linked to a central core. Rigorous synthesis and purification protocols have ensured that the average molar mass of the polymer molecules in Sample L is identical to the average molar mass of the polymer molecules in Sample B.\n\nBoth samples are dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to create dilute solutions of the same concentration. These solutions are then individually injected into a Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) system, which separates molecules based on their effective size in solution, also known as their hydrodynamic volume. In an SEC column, the stationary phase consists of porous beads. Molecules that are too large to enter the pores are excluded and travel a shorter path through the column, thus eluting earlier. Smaller molecules can penetrate the pores, which results in a longer pathway and later elution.\n\nBased on these principles, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the outcome of the SEC experiment?\n\nA. Sample B (branched) will elute earlier than Sample L (linear) because its compact, rigid structure prevents it from entering the pores of the stationary phase.\n\nB. Sample L (linear) will elute earlier than Sample B (branched) because, for a given molar mass, the linear polymer chain occupies a larger hydrodynamic volume in solution.\n\nC. Sample L and Sample B will elute at the same time because the separation mechanism in SEC is fundamentally based on molar mass, which is identical for both samples.\n\nD. Sample B (branched) will elute earlier than Sample L (linear) because its smaller hydrodynamic volume allows it to diffuse more quickly through the interstitial spaces of the column.\n\nE. The elution order cannot be determined without a universal calibration curve, as the interaction between the polymer and the solvent is the dominant factor.", "solution": "Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) separates by hydrodynamic size, not by molar mass. The elution volume satisfies\n$$\nV_{e} = V_{0} + K V_{i},\n$$\nwhere $V_{0}$ is the void volume, $V_{i}$ is the pore volume accessible to the solute, and $K$ is an effective partition coefficient that decreases as the hydrodynamic size increases. Thus, larger hydrodynamic volume implies smaller $K$ and hence smaller $V_{e}$ (earlier elution), while smaller hydrodynamic volume implies larger $K$ and hence larger $V_{e}$ (later elution).\n\nFor polymer coils in solution, the hydrodynamic size can be characterized by the hydrodynamic radius $R_{h}$ or hydrodynamic volume $V_{h} \\propto R_{h}^{3}$. The Stokes–Einstein relation\n$$\nD = \\frac{k_{B} T}{6 \\pi \\eta R_{h}}\n$$\nshows that, at fixed solvent viscosity $\\eta$ and temperature $T$, a smaller $R_{h}$ corresponds to a larger diffusion coefficient $D$, but in SEC the dominant effect on elution is geometric exclusion from pores, captured by the dependence of $K$ on size, not diffusion rate through the interstitial mobile phase.\n\nFor polymers of identical molar mass $M$, branching makes the coil more compact, so that\n$$\nR_{h,\\text{branched}} < R_{h,\\text{linear}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad V_{h,\\text{branched}} < V_{h,\\text{linear}}.\n$$\nEquivalently, by the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada relation,\n$$\n[\\eta] = K M^{a},\n$$\nthe intrinsic viscosity $[\\eta]$ (a measure proportional to hydrodynamic volume at fixed $M$) is smaller for branched polymers than for linear polymers at the same $M$, i.e.,\n$$\n[\\eta]_{\\text{branched}} < [\\eta]_{\\text{linear}} \\quad \\text{at fixed } M.\n$$\nTherefore, at the same $M$, the linear sample has the larger hydrodynamic volume and thus a smaller $K$, yielding a smaller elution volume $V_{e}$ (earlier elution) than the branched sample.\n\nEvaluating the statements:\n- A is incorrect because branched polymers are more compact, not prevented from pore entry; they enter pores more and thus elute later.\n- B is correct: linear polymers have larger hydrodynamic volume at the same molar mass and therefore elute earlier.\n- C is incorrect because SEC separation is fundamentally by size (hydrodynamic volume), not solely molar mass.\n- D is incorrect because a smaller hydrodynamic volume does not cause earlier elution; it increases pore access and thus causes later elution. Diffusion differences do not override the size-exclusion mechanism determining $V_{e}$.\n- E is incorrect because the elution order can be predicted from size considerations without a universal calibration; universal calibration is used to relate $V_{e}$ to $M$ via $[\\eta]M$, not to determine the qualitative elution order.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1338387"}, {"introduction": "We've seen qualitatively that branched polymers are more compact than their linear counterparts of the same mass.
