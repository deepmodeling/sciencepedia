One such critical process in free-radical polymerization is chain transfer, where a growing polymer chain is terminated prematurely. This practice problem explores a specific and important case known as degradative chain transfer, which explains why certain monomers, like propylene, fail to produce high molecular weight polymers [@problem_id:1326223]. By calculating the number-average degree of polymerization, $\\overline{X_n}$, under these conditions, you will gain insight into the kinetic factors that can dictate the success or failure of a polymerization reaction.", "problem": "In the field of polymer chemistry, free-radical polymerization is a workhorse method for synthesizing a vast array of materials. However, not all vinyl monomers are equally suitable for producing high molecular weight polymers via this mechanism. A classic example is propylene ($CH_2=CHCH_3$), which, unlike styrene or methyl methacrylate, tends to form low molecular weight oligomeric oils rather than useful solid polymers under typical free-radical conditions.\n\nThis behavior is attributed to a highly efficient side reaction known as degradative chain transfer to monomer. In this process, a growing polymer radical, instead of adding to the double bond of another monomer, abstracts a hydrogen atom from the allylic position (the -CH$_3$ group) of a propylene monomer. This event terminates the growth of that specific polymer chain and generates a resonance-stabilized allylic radical. This new radical is significantly less reactive and is very slow to initiate a new polymer chain.\n\nConsider a free-radical polymerization of propylene conducted at a specific temperature. For the purpose of this problem, assume that the kinetics of chain growth are exclusively limited by this degradative chain transfer process. That is, you may neglect all other chain termination events, such as radical-radical coupling and disproportionation, as well as chain transfer to solvent or initiator.\n\nGiven the following rate constants at the reaction temperature:\n- Rate constant for propagation, $k_p = 515 \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-1}$\n- Rate constant for degradative chain transfer to monomer, $k_{tr,M} = 8.75 \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nCalculate the expected number-average degree of polymerization, $\\overline{X_n}$, for the resulting polypropylene oligomers.
