In this practice, you will predict how the IR spectrum of a polyamide film changes under two different aging conditions—hydrolysis and photo-oxidation—connecting specific reaction pathways to distinct spectroscopic signatures in the carbonyl region [@problem_id:1300965].", "problem": "A materials chemist is investigating the degradation mechanisms of Polyamide-6,6, a common engineering thermoplastic. The repeating unit of Polyamide-6,6 is $\\text{-[NH-(CH}_2)_6\\text{-NH-CO-(CH}_2)_4\\text{-CO]-}$. Two thin films of this polymer are subjected to accelerated aging tests. Film A is immersed in deionized water at an elevated temperature to induce hydrolysis. Film B is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in an oxygen-rich atmosphere to induce photo-oxidation. The degradation is monitored by taking Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra over time, focusing on the evolution of new peaks in the carbonyl region of $1700 - 1850 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n\nBased on established degradation pathways and spectroscopic principles, predict the most likely changes observed in this specific spectral region for each film. You are provided with the following information:\n- The primary C=O stretching vibration (Amide I band) of the original, undegraded Polyamide-6,6 occurs below $1700 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and is not the focus of this analysis.\n- The degradation of Film A (hydrolysis) primarily results in chain scission at the amide linkage, forming new functional groups. Carboxylic acids formed in a solid polymer matrix typically exist as hydrogen-bonded dimers, which exhibit a characteristic broad C=O absorption centered around $1710 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n- The degradation of Film B (photo-oxidation) is known to proceed via radical mechanisms, with a major pathway involving oxidation of the methylene group ($\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-}$) adjacent to the amide nitrogen. This leads to the formation of imide ($-\\text{CO-N-CO}-$) functional groups. Acyclic imides characteristically exhibit two distinct C=O stretching absorptions due to asymmetric and symmetric vibrations, typically appearing near $1780 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and $1720 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$, respectively.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the expected evolution of the FTIR spectra in the $1700 - 1850 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ region?\n\nA. Film A will show the gradual appearance of two sharp peaks near $1780 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and $1720 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.

Hydrogen bonding leads to a broadened and slightly red-shifted C=O stretching absorption relative to non-hydrogen-bonded acids.\n- The characteristic spectral signature is therefore a single, broad absorption centered around $1710\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ in the $1700 - 1850\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ region.\n\nFor Film B (photo-oxidation):\n- Photo-oxidation of the methylene group adjacent to the amide nitrogen, $\\mathrm{-CH_{2}-NH-}$, proceeds via radical pathways to form imide functionalities $\\mathrm{-CO-N-CO-}$.\n- An imide contains two coupled carbonyl groups. Treating the two C=O oscillators as coupled, there are two normal modes: a symmetric combination and an asymmetric combination. Both modes are IR active in acyclic imides.\n- These give rise to two distinct C=O stretching bands: the asymmetric stretch at higher wavenumber near $1780\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and the symmetric stretch near $1720\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. These appear as relatively sharp peaks compared to hydrogen-bond-broadened acid bands.\n\nMapping these mechanistic and spectroscopic expectations to the options:\n- Film A: one broad band near $1710\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ (carboxylic acid dimers).\n- Film B: two sharp peaks near $1780$ and $1720\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ (imide asymmetric and symmetric C=O stretches).\nThus, the statement that best matches is that Film A shows a single broad band at $1710\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, while Film B shows two sharp peaks near $1780$ and $1720\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, which corresponds to option C.
