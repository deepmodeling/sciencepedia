This problem explores the crucial concept of the structure factor, which explains why some reflections are systematically absent due to destructive interference [@problem_id:1341992]. Understanding these extinction rules is vital for distinguishing between different Bravais lattices, such as simple cubic and body-centered cubic, from their unique diffraction fingerprints.", "problem": "A materials scientist is performing an X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment on an elemental solid. In its simple cubic (SC) phase, a diffraction peak from the (100) planes is observed. The material then undergoes a phase transition to a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, keeping the same conventional cubic lattice parameter, $a$. After the transition, the (100) diffraction peak is no longer observed.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, a simple cubic structure is defined by a basis of one atom at fractional coordinates (0, 0, 0) within the unit cell. A body-centered cubic structure is defined by a basis of two identical atoms at fractional coordinates (0, 0, 0) and (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct physical explanation for the disappearance of the (100) peak in the BCC phase?\n\nA. The Bragg condition can no longer be satisfied for the (100) planes in a BCC lattice, irrespective of the X-ray wavelength used.\n\nB. The addition of the body-center atom introduces scattering from a new set of parallel planes which are exactly halfway between the original (100) planes, leading to complete destructive interference for the (100) reflection.\n\nC. The body-center atom significantly increases the X-ray absorption coefficient of the material, which dampens the (100) reflection to zero intensity.\n\nD. In a BCC lattice, the (100) crystallographic planes do not contain any atoms and therefore cannot produce a diffraction peak.\n\nE. The interplanar spacing of the (100) planes is halved in the BCC structure, which shifts the diffraction peak to an angle so large that it is outside the range of measurement.", "solution": "Bragg’s law gives the angular condition for diffraction from planes with interplanar spacing $d_{hkl}$:\n$$\n2d_{hkl}\\sin\\theta = n\\lambda.\n$$\nFor a cubic lattice, the spacing is\n$$\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}+l^{2}}}.\n$$\nThus $d_{100}=a$ irrespective of whether the conventional cubic cell is simple cubic or body-centered cubic. Therefore the Bragg condition can still be satisfied for $(100)$ after the phase transition, so the disappearance of the peak must be due to a vanishing structure factor, not the impossibility of meeting Bragg’s law.\n\nThe diffracted intensity is proportional to the square of the structure factor $F_{hkl}$.
