The supersaturation is very low, so $\\Delta \\mu$ is small. In this kinetics-limited, low-driving-force regime, growth proceeds by layer advancement on low-index faces. Because $\\beta(\\hat{n})$ is highly anisotropic (as stated), faces with low normal velocity persist while faster-growing directions shrink away, yielding well-developed flat facets that approach the Wulff-like habit. The interface is morphologically stable in this regime (Mullins–Sekerka analysis shows that sufficiently small $\\Delta \\mu$ with kinetics control suppresses amplification of interfacial perturbations). Therefore, faceted polyhedra are expected.\n\nExperiment B: The solution is stagnant, so $\\delta$ is large, and the supersaturation is very high, so $C_{\\infty} - C_{s}$ is large. This places growth in the diffusion-limited regime with $v_{n} \\approx J/\\rho$. The concentration field outside the crystal satisfies $\\nabla^{2}C=0$, so any protrusion into the solution captures a disproportionately larger flux (Laplacian field focusing). Mullins–Sekerka theory predicts that under diffusion control with large driving force, a nominally planar or faceted front becomes morphologically unstable: small perturbations grow, leading to tip formation and branching. Crystallographic anisotropy then selects preferred growth directions for the primary and secondary arms, producing branched dendritic morphologies. Thus, dendrites are expected.\n\nEliminating the alternatives: High supersaturation and stagnant conditions do not favor macroscopic equilibrium faceting (ruling out faceted crystals in Experiment B), while low supersaturation with perfect mixing does not favor dendrites (ruling out dendrites in Experiment A). Spherical particles or thin platelets are not the generic outcomes under the stated controls for an anisotropic crystal; instead, faceted or dendritic shapes dominate as argued.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is: Experiment A yields faceted polyhedra, and Experiment B yields branched dendrites.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1319413"}]}
