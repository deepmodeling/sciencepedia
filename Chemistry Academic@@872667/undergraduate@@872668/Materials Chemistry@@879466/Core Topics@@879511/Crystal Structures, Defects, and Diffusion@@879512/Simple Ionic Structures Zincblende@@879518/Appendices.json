This structure can be described by a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice with a two-atom basis. Within a conventional cubic unit cell, we can define the atomic positions using fractional coordinates $(x, y, z)$, where each coordinate ranges from 0 to 1. The sulfide ions (S²⁻) occupy the standard FCC lattice sites: (0,0,0), (1/2,1/2,0), (1/2,0,1/2), and (0,1/2,1/2). The zinc ions (Zn²⁺) are tetrahedrally coordinated to the sulfide ions and are located at the positions: (1/4,1/4,1/4), (3/4,3/4,1/4), (3/4,1/4,3/4), and (1/4,3/4,3/4).\n\nA family of crystallographic planes is described by a set of Miller indices $(hkl)$.

This thought experiment [@problem_id:1333556] asks you to apply your knowledge of the zincblende structure to the concept of point defects. By considering the relative sizes of the ions and the nature of interstitial sites, you can develop physical intuition to predict which type of Frenkel defect is more likely to form, a key skill in defect engineering.", "problem": "In an idealized crystal of zinc sulfide (ZnS), which adopts the zincblende structure, zinc exists as Zn²⁺ cations and sulfur as S²⁻ anions. The structure can be described as a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice of sulfide anions with zinc cations occupying half of the available tetrahedral interstitial sites. In real crystals, point defects are always present. One common type is the Frenkel defect, which occurs when an ion is displaced from its normal lattice position to a nearby interstitial site, creating a vacancy-interstitial pair.\n\nGiven the ionic radii for the cation, $r_{\\text{Zn}^{2+}} = 74 \\text{ pm}$, and the anion, $r_{\\text{S}^{2-}} = 184 \\text{ pm}$, determine which type of Frenkel defect (cation or anion) is predominantly expected to form in zinc sulfide and the primary reason for its prevalence.\n\nA. Cation Frenkel defect, because the smaller size of the Zn²⁺ cation allows it to move into an interstitial site with significantly less lattice distortion.\n\nB. Cation Frenkel defect, because the lower effective nuclear charge of the Zn²⁺ cation makes it more mobile within the lattice.\n\nC. Anion Frenkel defect, because the larger S²⁻ anion can form more stable bonds in the interstitial position, lowering the overall energy of the crystal.\n\nD. Anion Frenkel defect, because the S²⁻ anions form the primary FCC lattice structure, making them more likely to be displaced.\n\nE. Both defect types are equally likely, as the energy required to create a defect is a property of the bulk crystal lattice and does not depend on the specific ion being displaced.", "solution": "We start by identifying the lattice and interstitial geometry. In zincblende ZnS, the $\\text{S}^{2-}$ anions form an FCC lattice and the $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$ cations occupy half of the tetrahedral interstitial sites. A Frenkel defect consists of an ion leaving its regular lattice site and moving to an interstitial site, producing a vacancy-interstitial pair.\n\nTo decide whether a cation or an anion Frenkel defect is more favorable, we compare the sizes of the ions to the available interstitial sites and assess the associated lattice distortion (elastic strain) energy. The given ionic radii are\n$$\nr_{\\text{Zn}^{2+}} = 74\\,\\text{pm}, \\quad r_{\\text{S}^{2-}} = 184\\,\\text{pm}.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nr_{\\text{Zn}^{2+}} < r_{\\text{S}^{2-}}.\n$$\nTetrahedral interstitial sites in close-packed anion lattices are small. The energy cost for placing an ion into an interstitial is dominated by short-range repulsions and elastic strain, which increase strongly with the size mismatch between the ion and the cavity. Because $r_{\\text{Zn}^{2+}}$ is much smaller than $r_{\\text{S}^{2-}}$, moving a $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$ from its normal site into a nearby interstitial site produces significantly less lattice distortion than attempting to place the much larger $\\text{S}^{2-}$ anion into an interstitial site. Consequently, the formation energy for a cation Frenkel defect is lower than for an anion Frenkel defect.\n\nAlternative explanations in the options can be evaluated. The idea that a lower effective nuclear charge of $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$ would increase mobility is incorrect in this context; defect formation is governed primarily by size and resulting lattice strain rather than such atomic-structure considerations. The fact that $\\text{S}^{2-}$ forms the primary FCC lattice does not make it more likely to be displaced; in fact, its larger size and strong packing make interstitial accommodation highly unfavorable. The assertion that both defect types are equally likely contradicts the size-dependent strain argument above.\n\nTherefore, the predominant Frenkel defect in ZnS is the cation Frenkel defect, primarily because the smaller $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$ cation can occupy an interstitial site with much less lattice distortion and lower energy cost than the larger $\\text{S}^{2-}$ anion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1333556"}]}
