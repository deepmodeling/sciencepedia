However, in other FCC metals, like aluminum, annealing twins are observed very rarely.\n\nGiven that both copper and aluminum are FCC metals and undergo similar recrystallization processes, which of the following physical properties is the primary reason for this significant difference in the tendency to form annealing twins?\n\nA. Melting Point\nB. Stacking Fault Energy (SFE)\nC. Electrical Conductivity\nD. Atomic Mass\nE.

The formation and stability of planar defects such as stacking faults and twins are controlled by the stacking fault energy (SFE), denoted $\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$.\n\nEnergetic and mechanical argument:\n- A perfect dislocation of Burgers vector $b$ can dissociate into two Shockley partials of Burgers vectors $b_{1}$ and $b_{2}$ separated by a distance $d$, leaving a stacking fault of energy $\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$ per unit area between them.\n- The two partials repel elastically with a force per unit length that has the form\n$$\nf_{\\text{rep}}=\\frac{K\\,b_{1}b_{2}}{d},\n$$\nwhere $K$ is an elastic constant that depends on shear modulus $\\mu$, Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$, and dislocation character (for example, $K=\\mu/\\left(2\\pi(1-\\nu)\\right)$ for edge character; the exact prefactor is not essential for the dependence on $\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$).\n- The stacking fault between the partials exerts an attractive force per unit length tending to shrink the separation, which is given by\n$$\nf_{\\text{SF}}=\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}.\n$$\n- At equilibrium separation $d$, these forces balance:\n$$\n\\frac{K\\,b_{1}b_{2}}{d}=\\gamma_{\\text{SF}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad d=\\frac{K\\,b_{1}b_{2}}{\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}}.\n$$\nThis shows $d\\propto \\gamma_{\\text{SF}}^{-1}$.\n\nPhysical consequence for twinning: A lower $\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$ increases $d$, stabilizes extended stacking faults, and facilitates the successive glide of partials on adjacent $\\{111\\}$ planes, thereby lowering the energetic barrier to form coherent twin boundaries. Hence, twinning (including annealing twins formed by growth accidents during recrystallization) is promoted in low-SFE FCC metals. Conversely, a high $\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$ reduces $d$, disfavors extended faults, and suppresses twinning.\n\nMaterial correlation: Copper and many brasses have low $\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$ and thus frequently exhibit annealing twins. Aluminum has a high $\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$, so annealing twins are rare despite the FCC structure and similar recrystallization processes.\n\nOther listed properties (melting point, electrical conductivity, atomic mass, elastic modulus) do not primarily control the propensity for twinning during recrystallization in FCC metals when compared to the dominant effect of $\\gamma_{\\text{SF}}$.\n\nTherefore, the primary property governing the difference is the stacking fault energy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1323678"}]}
