One major factor is the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy gained by the cations, which gives rise to an Octahedral Site Preference Energy (OSPE).\n\nConsider the compound Magnesium Ferrite, $MgFe_2O_4$.

Normal spinel, because the $Mg^{2+}$ ion is smaller than the $Fe^{3+}$ ion and thus fits better into the smaller tetrahedral interstices.\n\nB. Inverse spinel, because the $Fe^{3+}$ ions have a greater tendency for covalent bonding, which is favored in the tetrahedral geometry.\n\nC.
