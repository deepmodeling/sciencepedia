However, in the solid state, it adopts a more complex polymeric structure to overcome the electron deficiency of the beryllium atom. In this solid-state network, the structure can be described as a long chain of beryllium atoms where each beryllium atom is tetrahedrally coordinated to four hydrogen atoms.

Beryllium has atomic number $4$, so its electron configuration is $1s^22s^2$; the valence shell is the $n=2$ shell. In solid beryllium hydride, the description states that each Be is tetrahedrally coordinated to four hydrogen atoms via bridging hydrogens in a polymeric chain. Around any Be center, there are four Be–H sigma-bonding domains and no lone pairs, giving a steric number of $4$, which corresponds to a tetrahedral electron-domain geometry.\n\nA tetrahedral arrangement requires four equivalent hybrid orbitals formed by mixing one $s$ orbital and three $p$ orbitals, i.e., $sp^3$ hybridization. Options such as $sp$ (linear) and $sp^2$ (trigonal planar) do not match a tetrahedral coordination. Moreover, $dsp^3$ is not viable for a period $2$ element like Be because there are no energetically accessible $d$ orbitals.

This final practice presents a thought experiment involving a carbon atom within the metallic lattice of steel, prompting a critical evaluation of Valence Bond Theory itself. You will determine whether the concept of hybridization, which is built on the idea of localized electron-pair bonds, is a suitable descriptor in a delocalized metallic environment. [@problem_id:1346181]", "problem": "Austenite is a high-temperature, non-magnetic phase of steel, which is an alloy of iron and carbon. In the austenite phase, iron atoms arrange themselves in a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal structure. This structure can be visualized as a unit cell with iron atoms at the eight corners and at the center of each of the six faces. Small impurity atoms, like carbon, can dissolve into this structure by occupying interstitial sites, which are the empty spaces between the iron atoms.\n\nConsider a single carbon atom that occupies one of the largest interstitial sites within the austenite FCC lattice. This specific site, known as an octahedral site, is located at the exact center of the unit cell. Assuming the carbon atom interacts with its nearest-neighbor iron atoms, determine the most plausible hybridization state for this carbon atom based on the principles of Valence Bond Theory.\n\nWhich of the following best describes the hybridization of the carbon atom?\n\nA. $sp$\n\nB. $sp^2$\n\nC. $sp^3$\n\nD. $dsp^3$\n\nE. $d^2sp^3$\n\nF. The carbon atom is best described as unhybridized, as simple valence bond models are inadequate for interstitial atoms in a metallic lattice.", "solution": "We proceed by mapping the local coordination environment of the interstitial carbon to the expectations of valence bond (VB) theory and then assessing whether those expectations are physically meaningful for carbon in a metallic lattice.\n\nFirst, identify the local geometry. In an FCC lattice, the octahedral interstitial site at the center of the unit cell has six nearest-neighbor metal atoms located along the Cartesian axes. Thus the carbon at the octahedral site is sixfold coordinated in an octahedral environment, i.e., the local coordination number is $Z=6$ with directions along $\\pm x$, $\\pm y$, and $\\pm z$.\n\nSecond, connect coordination to VB hybridization. In the simplest VB hybridization scheme for localized, two-center, two-electron $\\sigma$ bonds, the standard correspondences are: linear $\\rightarrow sp$, trigonal planar $\\rightarrow sp^2$, tetrahedral $\\rightarrow sp^3$, trigonal bipyramidal $\\rightarrow dsp^3$ (or $sp^3d$), and octahedral $\\rightarrow d^2sp^3$ (or $sp^3d^2$). Therefore, a naive application based solely on geometry might suggest $d^2sp^3$ for an octahedral arrangement.\n\nThird, assess feasibility for carbon. For a second-period element such as carbon:\n- There are no low-energy $d$ orbitals in the $n=2$ shell; invoking $3d$ orbitals for hybridization is not physically reasonable in VB descriptions for main-group second-row atoms.\n- Forming six equivalent two-center, two-electron $\\sigma$ bonds would exceed the octet capacity of carbon. Carbon has four valence electrons and does not form six localized $\\sigma$ bonds without severe violation of the octet rule.\n- In metallic austenite, bonding is not well described by localized two-center bonds; instead, the Fe lattice exhibits delocalized metallic bonding. Interstitial carbon interacts with surrounding Fe atoms through a combination of steric (Pauli) repulsion, crystal-field-like effects, and band-structure-mediated delocalization. There are no discrete, directional C–Fe $\\sigma$ bonds that would justify any particular hybridization assignment.\n\nTherefore, simple VB hybridization labels (such as $sp$, $sp^2$, $sp^3$, $dsp^3$, or $d^2sp^3$) are not appropriate for interstitial carbon in an FCC metallic lattice. The most accurate choice among the options is that the carbon atom is best described as unhybridized because simple valence bond models are inadequate for this context.\n\nHence, the correct option is F.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{F}$$", "id": "1346181"}]}
