The Law of Conservation of Energy", "solution": "Identify the relevant subshell structure: the $3p$ subshell consists of three degenerate orbitals, $3p_{x}$, $3p_{y}$, and $3p_{z}$, all with the same energy in an isolated atom.\n\nState the governing rule for electron placement within degenerate orbitals: Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity states that for a set of degenerate orbitals, electrons occupy them singly with parallel spins before any pairing occurs. This minimizes electron-electron repulsion and maximizes total spin.\n\nCompare the given arrangement to this rule: the configuration places two electrons paired in $3p_{x}$, one electron in $3p_{y}$, and leaves $3p_{z}$ empty. Because there is an unoccupied degenerate orbital ($3p_{z}$) while pairing already occurs in $3p_{x}$, this directly violates Hund's rule.\n\nExclude other principles:\n- The Pauli exclusion principle requires that no two electrons in the same atom have the same set of quantum numbers; in a paired orbital the two electrons have opposite spins, so Pauli is not violated here.\n- The Aufbau principle concerns the order of filling across different subshells in the ground state; while the overall excited configuration deviates from ground-state filling, the question asks specifically about the arrangement within the degenerate $3p$ orbitals, for which Hund's rule is the relevant principle.\n- The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is unrelated to orbital occupancy patterns.\n- The law of conservation of energy is not a rule determining electron distribution in degenerate orbitals; excitation requires energy but does not imply a violation of this law.\n\nTherefore, the specific violation within the degenerate $3p$ orbitals is of Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1991503"}, {"introduction": "While the Aufbau principle provides a reliable roadmap for determining the electron configurations of most elements, certain atoms deviate from this pattern to achieve a more stable state.

The $6s$ orbital contains one unpaired electron, and the $5d$ subshell is completely filled with ten electrons, arranged as five pairs.\n\nB.
