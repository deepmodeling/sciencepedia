In its most common cubic polymorph, known as zinc blende or sphalerite, the crystal structure is based on a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice.\n\nThe structure can be described as follows: The sulfide anions ($\\text{S}^{2-}$) occupy the lattice sites of an FCC unit cell. The zinc cations ($\\text{Zn}^{2+}$) are then situated in specific interstitial voids within this anion framework. Specifically, the zinc cations occupy half of the available tetrahedral voids. A tetrahedral void is an empty space located at the center of a tetrahedron formed by four of the host lattice anions. For example, considering the sulfide anion at a corner of the unit cell and the three sulfide anions at the centers of the adjacent faces, these four anions form the vertices of a regular tetrahedron.
