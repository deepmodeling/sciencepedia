Consider a simplified, steady-state, closed-loop model for the production and recycling of aluminum. In this system, new aluminum alloy is produced from a blend of primary aluminum (extracted from bauxite ore) and secondary aluminum (recycled from end-of-life products).\n\nThe system operates such that the amount of aluminum entering the consumer market is exactly balanced by the combination of newly produced primary aluminum and recovered secondary aluminum. The mass of old products lost from the cycle at its end-of-life must be replaced with an equal mass of primary aluminum to maintain a steady state.\n\nAssume the following parameters for the system:\n- The energy required for primary production is $E_P = 215$ MJ per kg of aluminum produced from bauxite ore.\n- The collection rate for end-of-life aluminum products is $R_C = 0.940$.
