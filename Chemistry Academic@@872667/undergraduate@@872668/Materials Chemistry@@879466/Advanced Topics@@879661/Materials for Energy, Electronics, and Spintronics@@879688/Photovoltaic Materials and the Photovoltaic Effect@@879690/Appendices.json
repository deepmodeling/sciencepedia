While it might seem intuitive that the energy of absorbed and emitted photons should be identical, there is often a subtle difference. This exercise [@problem_id:1322609] delves into the physical reasons behind this phenomenon, known as a Stokes shift, by examining the processes that occur immediately after a photon creates an electron-hole pair.", "problem": "A materials scientist is performing a quality control analysis on a high-purity, intrinsic Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) single crystal, which is a key material for high-efficiency solar cells. The characterization involves Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy at room temperature. The resulting spectrum shows a single, sharp emission peak corresponding to near-band-edge radiative recombination at a wavelength of $\\lambda_{PL} = 870$ nm.\n\nThe scientist notes that the absorption edge of a material, $\\lambda_{abs}$, which corresponds to the longest wavelength of light that can be efficiently absorbed to create an electron-hole pair, is expected to be slightly shorter than the measured PL peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{abs} < \\lambda_{PL}$).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical explanation for why the peak emission wavelength is longer than the absorption edge wavelength in a high-purity direct band gap semiconductor like GaAs?\n\nA. Photons with energy greater than the band gap create \"hot\" charge carriers (electrons and holes) with excess kinetic energy. These carriers rapidly thermalize to the band edges by losing energy to lattice vibrations (phonons) before they recombine radiatively. The emitted photon's energy is therefore slightly less than the initial absorbed photon's energy.\n\nB. The emission primarily originates from the radiative recombination of charge carriers through deep-level defect states located in the middle of the band gap, whose energy is inherently lower than the band-to-band energy.\n\nC. The radiative emission is a phonon-assisted process because GaAs is an indirect band gap semiconductor, and the involvement of a phonon during emission reduces the energy of the emitted photon.\n\nD. The quantum efficiency of the light absorption process is fundamentally lower than the efficiency of the light emission process, causing the characteristic energy for absorption to be higher than that for emission.\n\nE. The band gap of the material temporarily increases between the moment of photon absorption and the moment of photon emission due to dielectric screening effects from the newly created charge carriers.\n\nF. The principle of momentum conservation requires the emitted photon and a recoiling electron to share the energy from the band gap, which forces the photon's energy to be strictly less than the band gap energy.", "solution": "Define the absorption-edge photon energy and the PL photon energy via the photon energy-wavelength relation $E_{\\gamma}=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$. The observation $\\lambda_{\\text{PL}}>\\lambda_{\\text{abs}}$ implies\n$$\nE_{\\text{PL}}=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda_{\\text{PL}}}<\\frac{h c}{\\lambda_{\\text{abs}}}=E_{\\text{abs}}.\n$$\nIn a direct band gap semiconductor like GaAs, interband absorption at the edge excites electrons from the valence-band maximum (VBM) to the conduction-band minimum (CBM) when $E_{\\gamma}\\gtrsim E_{g}$. Photons with $E_{\\gamma}>E_{g}$ produce electrons and holes with excess kinetic energy above the band extrema. Carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon scattering rapidly redistribute this excess energy into the lattice (phonon emission), bringing both electrons and holes to thermal quasi-equilibrium near the CBM and VBM, respectively. This nonradiative thermalization step enforces\n$$\nE_{\\text{initial}}=E_{g}+\\Delta E \\quad \\longrightarrow \\quad E_{\\text{carriers}}\\to E_{g}\\ \\text{(after phonon emission of energy } \\Delta E).\n$$\nSubsequent radiative recombination is a direct transition at $k\\approx 0$, conserving crystal momentum without phonon assistance, and the emitted photon energy is therefore approximately the band gap at the recombination conditions,\n$$\nE_{\\text{emit}}\\approx E_{g},\n$$\nwhich is strictly less than the energy of the initially absorbed photon when $\\Delta E>0$, i.e.,\n$$\nE_{\\text{emit}}\\approx E_{g}<E_{g}+\\Delta E=E_{\\text{abs}}.\n$$\nThus, the PL peak appears at longer wavelength than the absorption edge (a small Stokes shift) because carriers lose excess energy to phonons before radiative emission.\n\nNow assess the options against these principles:\n- A states that above-gap photons create hot carriers that rapidly thermalize by phonon emission before radiative recombination, so the emitted photon has slightly less energy than the absorbed photon. This matches the energy relaxation argument, $E_{\\text{PL}}<E_{\\text{abs}}$, derived from $E_{\\gamma}=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ and carrier thermalization.\n- B invokes deep-level defects. In a high-purity direct-gap semiconductor with a single sharp near-band-edge PL peak, deep-level recombination is inconsistent; it would yield much lower-energy, broader emission and contradict the observed near-band-edge line.\n- C claims phonon-assisted emission due to an indirect gap. GaAs is a direct band gap semiconductor; radiative recombination is direct in $k$-space, so no phonon is required for momentum conservation in the dominant emission channel.\n- D contrasts absorption and emission efficiencies. Quantum efficiency concerns rates and probabilities, not the photon energies set by band structure and carrier relaxation; it does not explain a systematic energy shift.\n- E suggests a transient increase of the band gap via screening. Screening and carrier-induced band-gap renormalization typically reduce the quasiparticle gap at finite carrier density; in any case, such an effect does not produce the generic small Stokes shift described here under low to moderate excitation.\n- F claims momentum conservation forces energy sharing with a recoiling electron. In a crystal, crystal momentum is conserved; for direct transitions near $k\\approx 0$, the photon carries the needed momentum and the recoil energy is negligible. The emitted photon energy equals the electronic transition energy (approximately $E_{g}$), not strictly less due to recoil.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is the hot-carrier thermalization and subsequent band-edge emission described in A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1322609"}, {"introduction": "Generating electron-hole pairs is only the first step in the photovoltaic process; these charge carriers must then be successfully transported to and collected by the device's electrodes.

The device's active region consists of a semiconductor absorber layer of thickness $W$. Light with an initial intensity $I_0$ is incident normal to the surface at $x=0$, and a p-n junction, which acts as a perfect sink for minority carriers, is also located at this surface.\n\nThe generation rate of electron-hole pairs at a depth $x$ from the surface is proportional to the local rate of light absorption. This absorption follows the Beer-Lambert law, where the light intensity at depth $x$ is $I(x) = I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha x)$, with $\\alpha$ being the material's absorption coefficient.\n\nA minority carrier generated at depth $x$ has a finite probability of recombining before it can diffuse to the junction. This survival probability, which corresponds to the probability of being collected, is modeled as $P(x) = \\exp(-x/L_D)$, where $L_D$ is the minority carrier diffusion length. The overall charge collection efficiency, $\\eta_{coll}$, is the ratio of the total number of carriers collected at the junction to the total number of carriers generated within the layer (from $x=0$ to $x=W$).\n\nIn the case of a high-performance material where recombination is minimal, the diffusion length $L_D$ is very large compared to the layer thickness $W$.
