The active ions in the crystal host are modeled using a simplified three-level energy system comprising a ground state ($E_0$), a metastable upper lasing level ($E_1$), and a pump level ($E_2$). The laser operates through the following sequence: an external pump source excites electrons from the ground state to the pump level. The electrons then rapidly decay non-radiatively from the pump level to the metastable level, releasing energy in the form of phonons (lattice vibrations). Finally, laser emission occurs via stimulated emission as electrons transition from the metastable level back to the ground state.\n\nFrom spectroscopic measurements, the laser is found to emit coherent light at a wavelength of $\\lambda_{\\text{lase}} = 1064$ nm. Calorimetric measurements on the crystal under pumping conditions indicate that for each electron that decays from the pump level to the metastable level ($E_2 \\rightarrow E_1$), an average energy of $\\Delta E_{\\text{phonon}} = 0.825$ eV is dissipated as heat.\n\nAssuming the ground state energy is defined as $E_0 = 0$ eV, calculate the minimum energy that a pump photon must possess to enable the lasing process.\n\nFor your calculations, you may use the product of Planck's constant and the speed of light as $hc = 1240$ eV·nm.\n\nExpress your answer in electron-volts (eV).
