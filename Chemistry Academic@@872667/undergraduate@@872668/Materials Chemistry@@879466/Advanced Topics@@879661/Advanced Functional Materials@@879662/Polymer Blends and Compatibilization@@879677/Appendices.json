Since PS and PB are immiscible, a simple blend results in poor mechanical properties due to weak interaction between the two phases.\n\nTo address this, the student adds a small amount of a PS-block-PB diblock copolymer to the blend. This block copolymer is expected to act as a compatibilizer by localizing at the interface between the PS and PB phases.\n\nThe student prepares a sample of this new, compatibilized blend and then fractures it at low temperature to expose a fresh surface for analysis. Upon examining the fracture surface using a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) instrument, the student observes the following features:\n\n1.  The PB phase is present as roughly spherical particles dispersed within the continuous PS matrix.\n2.  The interface between the PB particles and the PS matrix is not a sharp, clean line. Instead, it appears somewhat indistinct.\n3.  The majority of the PB particles are held firmly within the PS matrix. The fracture has not cleanly pulled the particles out; instead, many PB particles appear stretched or torn.\n4.  The PS matrix material in the immediate vicinity of the PB particles shows significant evidence of localized plastic deformation, a phenomenon known as crazing.\n\nBased on this detailed description of the fracture surface morphology, what is the most accurate conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the PS-block-PB copolymer as a compatibilizing agent?\n\nA. The adhesion is poor. The presence of two separate, distinct phases (PS and PB) indicates that the compatibilizer has failed.\n\nB. The adhesion is excellent. The compatibilizer has successfully made the two polymers miscible, resulting in a single homogeneous phase.\n\nC. The adhesion is excellent.

The crazing observed in the PS matrix is a sign of brittleness, indicating the interface is weak and initiated cracks.", "solution": "Goal: infer interfacial adhesion from fracture surface morphology of a PS/PB blend compatibilized with a PS-block-PB diblock.\n\nPrinciples:\n- In immiscible, poorly adhered blends, fracture surfaces typically show clean particle pull-out and sharp, well-defined interfaces because the crack propagates along the weak interface.\n- Effective compatibilization does not necessarily render the system miscible into a single phase; rather, it lowers interfacial tension and creates an interphase with block copolymer anchored to each side, increasing interfacial adhesion and enabling stress transfer between phases.\n- Strong interfacial adhesion under load leads to deformation within the dispersed rubber particles (cavitation, stretching, tearing) and plastic deformation in the glassy matrix (crazing and/or shear banding) rather than interfacial debonding. These mechanisms increase energy dissipation and toughness.\n\nInterpretation of the observed features:\n1. PB as spherical particles in a continuous PS matrix confirms a two-phase morphology. This is consistent with immiscibility even in the presence of a compatibilizer; compatibilizers do not imply single-phase miscibility. Thus, the presence of two phases does not indicate failure of compatibilization.\n2. An indistinct interface suggests a diffuse interphase, consistent with localization of the diblock copolymer at the interface and reduced interfacial tension—evidence for compatibilization rather than a sharp, weak boundary.\n3. PB particles not being cleanly pulled out, and instead appearing stretched or torn, indicates that the crack did not propagate along the interface. This implies strong interfacial adhesion and effective stress transfer from the matrix to the particles.\n4. Crazing in the PS matrix adjacent to PB particles indicates that local stresses were transmitted across the interface into the glassy matrix, triggering energy-dissipative deformation mechanisms (crazes). In rubber-toughened PS, craze initiation and stabilization near rubber particles is a hallmark of improved toughness; this is not a sign of poor adhesion but rather of effective load transfer and toughening.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because two phases are expected in compatibilized but immiscible blends; morphology and lack of pull-out contradict poor adhesion.\n- B is incorrect because a single homogeneous phase would not show dispersed spherical PB particles.\n- C is correct because particle and matrix deformation, absence of pull-out, and a diffuse interphase are direct evidence of strong adhesion and effective stress transfer.\n- D misinterprets crazing; in toughened PS, crazing around rubber particles reflects effective stress transfer and energy dissipation, not necessarily interfacial weakness. The concurrent absence of pull-out contradicts poor adhesion.\n\nConclusion: The fracture morphology provides convergent evidence of excellent interfacial adhesion and effective compatibilization by the PS-block-PB diblock copolymer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1325555"}]}
