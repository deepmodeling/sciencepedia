[@problem_id:1299583]", "problem": "A crucial component in modern internal combustion engines is the knock sensor, which detects premature fuel detonation (knocking) by sensing characteristic high-frequency vibrations in the engine block. A simplified model of such a sensor consists of a small, solid cylinder of a piezoelectric ceramic, such as Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT). This cylinder has electrodes on its flat top and bottom faces.\n\nThe cylinder is oriented with its axis along the z-direction. It is \"poled\" during manufacturing, meaning it possesses a permanent spontaneous electrical polarization, $\\vec{P}_S$, which is uniform and directed along the positive z-axis (from the bottom face to the top face). The key material property for this application is the piezoelectric charge coefficient $d_{33}$, which relates an applied mechanical stress along the z-axis ($\\sigma_{33}$) to the change in electrical polarization along the z-axis ($\\Delta P_3$). For the PZT material used, the coefficient $d_{33}$ is known to be positive.\n\nDuring an engine knock, the cylinder experiences a sudden, brief uniaxial compressive stress along its axis. This means the top and bottom faces are pushed towards each other. An external circuit measures the resulting potential difference, defined as $V = V_{\\text{top}} - V_{\\text{bottom}}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the sign of the voltage $V$ generated across the cylinder during this compression event?\n\nA. $V$ becomes positive.\nB. $V$ becomes negative.\nC. $V$ remains zero because the forces are equal and opposite.\nD. The sign of $V$ depends on the magnitude of the compressive force.\nE. The sign of $V$ cannot be determined without knowing the pyroelectric coefficient.", "solution": "The solution to this problem hinges on the correct application of the sign conventions for piezoelectricity. The relationship between the change in polarization $\\Delta P_3$ along the z-axis and an applied stress $T_3$ is given by $\\Delta P_3 = d_{33} T_3$. However, the sign convention for the piezoelectric coefficient $d_{33}$ is critically important. The IEEE Standard on Piezoelectricity defines a positive $d_{33}$ as one that produces an *increase* in polarization in the positive axis direction when a *compressive* stress is applied along that same direction.\n\nIn this problem:\nThe cylinder is poled along the positive z-axis, so $\\vec{P}_S$ points upwards. A compressive stress is applied along the z-axis. The material has $d_{33} > 0$.\n\nAccording to the IEEE convention, these conditions mean the polarization along the +z axis *increases*. So, $\\Delta P_3 > 0$. This increase in positive polarization means that an additional positive bound charge appears on the top surface (where the outward normal is $+z$) and an additional negative bound charge on the bottom surface.\n\nThe sensor operates under open-circuit conditions, meaning no free charge can flow from the external circuit. To maintain charge neutrality on the isolated electrodes, free charges must redistribute to cancel the change in bound surface charge. A flow of negative free charge (electrons) to the top electrode and positive free charge to the bottom electrode is required to neutralize the additional bound charge.\n\nThis accumulation of negative free charge on the top electrode and positive free charge on the bottom electrode means the top electrode's potential becomes lower than the bottom electrode's potential. Therefore, the measured potential difference, $V = V_{\\text{top}} - V_{\\text{bottom}}$, becomes negative.\n\n- Option A is incorrect because a negative voltage is generated.\n- Option C is incorrect; the piezoelectric effect is non-zero.\n- Option D is incorrect; the sign of the voltage depends on the direction of the stress (compressive vs. tensile), not its magnitude.\n- Option E is incorrect; pyroelectricity relates to temperature changes, not stress.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1299583"}, {"introduction": "Effective engineering design often involves selecting the optimal material for a specific task. In the world of piezoelectrics, this choice is more nuanced than simply picking the material with the \"strongest\" response. This exercise challenges you to compare two candidate materials for a high-sensitivity pressure sensor, forcing a distinction between the piezoelectric charge coefficient ($d_{ij}$) and the voltage coefficient ($g_{ij}$), and revealing why maximizing open-circuit voltage requires a different strategy than maximizing generated charge. [@problem_id:1299629]", "problem": "An engineer is designing a highly sensitive dynamic pressure sensor. The core of the sensor is a small disc of a piezoelectric ceramic. The sensor operates by converting a small, rapidly changing force, applied perpendicular to the disc's flat faces, into a measurable voltage signal. The electronics connected to the sensor have a very high input impedance, meaning the sensor operates under near open-circuit conditions where minimal charge is drawn. The primary design goal is to maximize the output voltage for a given applied pressure (stress).\n\nTwo candidate materials, Material Alpha and Material Beta, are being considered. Their relevant material properties for the longitudinal piezoelectric effect (along the '3' axis, perpendicular to the faces) are provided below. The longitudinal piezoelectric charge coefficient, $d_{33}$, relates the induced electric polarization to the applied mechanical stress. The relative permittivity, $\\epsilon_r$, is the dielectric constant of the material relative to the vacuum permittivity.\n\n- **Material Alpha:** $d_{33} = 550 \\times 10^{-12}$ C/N, $\\epsilon_r = 2100$\n- **Material Beta:** $d_{33} = 180 \\times 10^{-12}$ C/N, $\\epsilon_r = 120$\n\nWhich material is the better choice for this specific application, and what is the correct physical reasoning behind this choice?\n\nA. Material Alpha should be chosen, as its significantly higher charge coefficient ($d_{33}$) means it generates more separated charge per unit of applied force, which directly results in a higher voltage.\nB. Material Beta should be chosen, because its much lower relative permittivity ($\\epsilon_r$) leads to a higher piezoelectric voltage coefficient ($g_{33}$), even though its charge coefficient ($d_{33}$) is lower.\nC. Material Alpha should be chosen, because its high relative permittivity ($\\epsilon_r$) allows the sensor to store more electrical energy, leading to a more powerful voltage signal.\nD. Material Beta should be chosen, because a lower charge coefficient ($d_{33}$) inherently corresponds to greater voltage sensitivity in all piezoelectric materials.\nE. Both materials are equally suitable because the final voltage output depends only on the sensor's thickness and the applied stress, not on the specific values of $d_{33}$ or $\\epsilon_r$.", "solution": "The linear piezoelectric constitutive relations (contracted notation) for the longitudinal 3-direction are\n$$\nD_{3} = d_{33}\\,T_{3} + \\epsilon_{33}^{T}\\,E_{3},\n$$\nwhere $D_{3}$ is electric displacement, $T_{3}$ is mechanical stress, $E_{3}$ is electric field, $d_{33}$ is the charge coefficient, and $\\epsilon_{33}^{T}$ is the permittivity at constant stress. For a homogeneous plate polarized and stressed along the 3-axis and operated under open-circuit conditions, the electrodes are isolated so that no free charge can flow. The free charge on the electrodes is therefore zero, which implies that the average normal electric displacement equals the free charge density, hence\n$$\nD_{3} = 0 \\quad \\text{(open circuit)}.\n$$\nImposing $D_{3}=0$ in the constitutive relation gives\n$$\n0 = d_{33}\\,T_{3} + \\epsilon_{33}^{T}\\,E_{3}\n\\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\;\nE_{3} = -\\frac{d_{33}}{\\epsilon_{33}^{T}}\\,T_{3}.\n$$\nDefining the piezoelectric voltage coefficient\n$$\ng_{33} \\equiv \\frac{d_{33}}{\\epsilon_{33}^{T}},\n$$\nthe open-circuit field is $E_{3} = -g_{33}\\,T_{3}$. For a plate of thickness $t$, the open-circuit voltage is\n$$\nV_{\\text{oc}} = -E_{3}\\,t = g_{33}\\,T_{3}\\,t.\n$$\nThus, for a given applied stress (pressure) and fixed thickness, the voltage sensitivity is proportional to $g_{33}$, not directly to $d_{33}$.

Comparing the two candidates, Material Beta has a much smaller $\\epsilon_{r}$ while its $d_{33}$ is only moderately smaller; consequently, the ratio $d_{33}/\\epsilon_{r}$ (and hence $g_{33}$) is larger for Material Beta than for Material Alpha.
