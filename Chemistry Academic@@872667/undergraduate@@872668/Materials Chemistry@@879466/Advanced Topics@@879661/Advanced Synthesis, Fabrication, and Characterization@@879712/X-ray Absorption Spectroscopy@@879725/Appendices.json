XANES is a technique that measures the absorption of X-rays as their energy is scanned across an absorption edge of a specific element. For sulfur, the S K-edge corresponds to the energy threshold for exciting a sulfur 1s core electron to an unoccupied state. The precise energy of this edge is highly sensitive to the local chemical environment and electronic structure of the sulfur atom.\n\nThe chemist has three reference compounds: elemental sulfur (in its stable rhombic form, $\\text{S}_8$), sodium sulfite ($\\text{Na}_2\\text{SO}_3$), and sodium sulfate ($\\text{Na}_2\\text{SO}_4$). Her goal is to establish a baseline for identifying these sulfur species in more complex materials.\n\nBased on fundamental principles of electronic structure, arrange the sulfur species—elemental sulfur (S), the sulfite ion ($\\text{SO}_3^{2-}$), and the sulfate ion ($\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$)—in order of increasing S K-edge absorption energy.\n\nA.

The threshold energy can be written schematically as\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{edge}} \\approx E_{\\mathrm{final}} - E_{1s},\n$$\nwhere $E_{1s}$ is the core-level energy (negative, with magnitude equal to the binding energy) and $E_{\\mathrm{final}}$ is the energy of the lowest accessible unoccupied state. To first order, chemical shifts in K-edge positions across different chemical environments are dominated by shifts in $E_{1s}$, since core-level binding energies are highly sensitive to the local electrostatic potential and effective nuclear charge, while changes in $E_{\\mathrm{final}}$ are typically smaller for K-edges.\n\nWithin a hydrogenic approximation for core levels,\n$$\nE_{1s} \\propto -Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{2},\n$$\nso increasing the effective nuclear charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ makes $E_{1s}$ more negative (larger in magnitude), which increases $E_{\\mathrm{edge}}$ via the relation above. Electronegative ligands withdraw electron density from sulfur, increasing $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ at the sulfur nucleus. Consequently, higher sulfur oxidation states correlate with higher $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, higher $1s$ binding energies, and thus higher K-edge energies.\n\nAssigning oxidation states:\n- Elemental sulfur in $\\text{S}_8$ has oxidation state $0$.\n- In $\\text{SO}_3^{2-}$, sulfur is in oxidation state $+4$.\n- In $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$, sulfur is in oxidation state $+6$.\n\nTherefore, the S K-edge energy increases with oxidation state in the order\n$$\n\\text{S}(0) < \\text{S}(+4) < \\text{S}(+6),\n$$\ni.e., elemental sulfur $<$ sulfite $<$ sulfate.

By applying a Fourier transform to the EXAFS signal, we can generate a pseudo-radial distribution function that visualizes the shells of neighboring atoms around the absorber. This practice challenges you to contrast the expected EXAFS data for a highly ordered crystalline material versus a disordered amorphous one, developing your intuition for how atomic structure is encoded in the spectrum [@problem_id:1346991].", "problem": "A materials chemist is investigating the local atomic environment of copper atoms in two different materials using the Cu K-edge Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) technique. The EXAFS signal, denoted as $\\chi(k)$, is the normalized oscillatory part of the X-ray absorption coefficient above an absorption edge, where $k$ is the photoelectron wavevector. The Fourier transform of $k$-weighted EXAFS data, $|\\text{FT}[k\\chi(k)]|$, provides a pseudo-radial distribution function.

Long-range periodicity implies well-defined $R_{j}$ and relatively small $\\sigma_{j}^{2}$ for each coordination shell, so $\\exp(-2\\sigma_{j}^{2}k^{2})$ damps the signal less strongly. Consequently, multiple coordination shells contribute coherently, yielding multiple distinct peaks in $|\\text{FT}[k\\chi(k)]|$ extending to larger apparent distances.\n2. The coordination numbers $N_{j}$ for higher shells are well-defined and relatively large, enhancing peak intensities for second and higher shells. Multiple-scattering paths in a crystal can also contribute additional distinct features at larger $R$.\n3. Peak positions in the uncorrected Fourier transform are set by $R_{j}$ and the phase shifts $\\delta_{j}(k)$; for a given absorber-scatterer pair (e.g., Cu-O, Cu-Cu), these shifts are not fundamentally different between materials of the same elements, so there is no systematic shift solely due to crystallinity versus amorphous nature.\n\nFor an amorphous glass (Material B, copper silicate glass):\n1. Only short-range order is preserved; higher shells are not periodically repeated. The distribution of bond lengths and angles increases $\\sigma_{j}^{2}$ (significant static disorder), so $\\exp(-2\\sigma_{j}^{2}k^{2})$ strongly damps oscillations, particularly at larger $k$, which in turn suppresses higher-shell contributions in $|\\text{FT}[k\\chi(k)]|$.\n2. Broad distributions of $R_{j}$ smear the Fourier features, making peaks broader and less intense. Past the first coordination shell (Cu-O), the lack of coherent long-range order and enhanced disorder cause second and higher shell peaks to be significantly attenuated or absent.\n3. As with the crystal, the uncorrected peak positions include phase shifts; there is no general principle that the amorphous material’s peaks shift systematically to lower $R$ compared to the crystal for the same scattering pairs.\n\nFrom the EXAFS amplitude factors, the key contrast arises from the disorder term $\\exp(-2\\sigma_{j}^{2}k^{2})$: smaller $\\sigma_{j}^{2}$ in a crystal preserves multiple shells and sharp features; larger $\\sigma_{j}^{2}$ in a glass suppresses higher shells and broadens the first shell. Thermal vibrations affect both materials, but the glass also has substantial static disorder, so the first-shell peak in the glass is typically broader and often less intense than in the crystal, not the reverse.\n\nTherefore:\n- Statement A is incorrect because EXAFS detects beyond the first shell.\n- Statement B is incorrect; sharp, long-range peaks characterize the crystal, not the glass.\n- Statement C is incorrect; the glass will not show multiple strong peaks out to large $R$, and there is no universal shift to lower $R$.\n- Statement D correctly states that the crystal exhibits multiple distinct shells, while the glass is dominated by the first shell with attenuated higher-shell peaks.\n- Statement E is incorrect; increased disorder in the glass, not the crystal, broadens and weakens the first-shell peak.\n\nHence the most accurate contrast is given by option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1346991"}, {"introduction": "While the Fourier transform of EXAFS data provides a powerful visual of atomic shells, extracting precise bond distances requires careful analysis.
