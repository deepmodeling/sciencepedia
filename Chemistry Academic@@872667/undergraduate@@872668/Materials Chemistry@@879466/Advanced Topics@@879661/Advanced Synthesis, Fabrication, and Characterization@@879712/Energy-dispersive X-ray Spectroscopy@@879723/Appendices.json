To interpret this fingerprint, one must first understand how the position and relative size of peaks relate to the underlying atomic structure. This exercise [@problem_id:1297292] provides a foundational practice in predicting the appearance of an EDS spectrum for a simple compound, forcing you to apply the core principles that govern characteristic X-ray generation. By sketching out the expected spectrum, you build an intuitive feel for how elemental identity and electron shell transitions translate into the data you will see in a real-world analysis.", "problem": "An analyst is using Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) to characterize a high-purity, stoichiometric semiconductor wafer of Gallium Arsenide (GaAs). The EDS system utilizes a focused beam of high-energy electrons to induce X-ray emissions from the sample. The electron beam has sufficient energy to excite electrons from both the K-shells and L-shells of gallium and arsenic atoms.\n\nFor this analysis, you are to predict the primary features of the observed EDS spectrum. The most intense characteristic X-ray lines for these elements are the K-alpha (resulting from an L-shell electron filling a K-shell vacancy) and L-alpha (resulting from an M-shell electron filling an L-shell vacancy). The energies for these specific transitions are provided below:\n\n- Gallium (Ga, Z=31): L-alpha line at 1.10 keV; K-alpha line at 9.25 keV.\n- Arsenic (As, Z=33): L-alpha line at 1.28 keV; K-alpha line at 10.54 keV.\n\nAssume the following general rules for interpreting the spectrum:\n1.  For the elements and typical operating conditions involved, the probability of generating L-shell X-rays is significantly higher than that for K-shell X-rays. This results in the L-alpha peaks being substantially more intense (taller) than the K-alpha peaks.\n2.  The sample is perfectly stoichiometric, meaning it contains an equal number of Ga and As atoms.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the expected EDS spectrum, considering only these four primary emission lines?\n\nA. The spectrum will show two distinct groups of peaks. A low-energy group consists of a peak for Ga L-alpha at 1.10 keV followed by a slightly higher energy peak for As L-alpha at 1.28 keV. A high-energy group consists of a peak for Ga K-alpha at 9.25 keV followed by a higher energy peak for As K-alpha at 10.54 keV. The L-alpha peaks are expected to be significantly more intense than the K-alpha peaks.\n\nB. The spectrum will show two distinct groups of peaks. A low-energy group will contain the L-alpha peaks for Ga and As, with the As peak appearing at a lower energy than the Ga peak. A high-energy group will contain the K-alpha peaks, also with the As peak appearing at a lower energy than the Ga peak.\n\nC. The spectrum will show four peaks at the correct energies (1.10, 1.28, 9.25, and 10.54 keV). However, the K-alpha peaks at 9.25 keV and 10.54 keV will be the most intense peaks in the spectrum, with the L-alpha peaks appearing much smaller.\n\nD. The spectrum will only consist of two peaks in the high-energy region, one for Ga K-alpha and one for As K-alpha. The L-shell emissions are too weak to be detected in a standard measurement.\n\nE. The spectrum will show four peaks, but the energy groups will be mixed. The peak order from lowest to highest energy will be Ga L-alpha, As K-alpha, Ga K-alpha, and As L-alpha.", "solution": "We are asked to predict the primary features of an EDS spectrum for a stoichiometric GaAs sample, considering the Ga and As L-alpha and K-alpha lines and the stated rules.\n\nFirst, identify which lines appear and their relative energies. Characteristic X-ray energies follow Moseley’s law, which can be expressed schematically as\n$$\nE \\propto (Z-\\sigma)^{2},\n$$\nwith different screening constants for different series. For a given element, K-series lines originate from transitions to the K-shell, while L-series lines originate from transitions to the L-shell. Because K-shell binding energies are larger than L-shell binding energies, for the same element we have\n$$\nE_{K\\alpha}^{X} > E_{L\\alpha}^{X},\n$$\nfor any element $X$. Therefore, for both Ga and As, the K-alpha lines lie at higher energy than the L-alpha lines, producing two energy groups: a low-energy group (L-alpha) and a high-energy group (K-alpha).\n\nSecond, order the elements within each series. Since arsenic has a larger atomic number than gallium, $Z_{\\text{As}} > Z_{\\text{Ga}}$, Moseley’s law implies\n$$\nE_{L\\alpha}^{\\text{As}} > E_{L\\alpha}^{\\text{Ga}}, \\quad E_{K\\alpha}^{\\text{As}} > E_{K\\alpha}^{\\text{Ga}}.\n$$\nThus, within the L-alpha group, the Ga L-alpha line appears at lower energy than the As L-alpha line; within the K-alpha group, the Ga K-alpha line appears at lower energy than the As K-alpha line. This matches the ordering implied by the given energies.\n\nThird, compare intensities. By the stated rule 1, under the given conditions the probability of generating L-shell X-rays is significantly higher than that for K-shell X-rays, so the L-alpha peaks are substantially more intense than the K-alpha peaks:\n$$\nI_{L\\alpha}^{X} \\gg I_{K\\alpha}^{X},\n$$\nfor $X \\in \\{\\text{Ga}, \\text{As}\\}$. By rule 2 (stoichiometric sample), the numbers of Ga and As atoms are equal, so within the same series the Ga and As peak intensities are comparable aside from differences in excitation cross section and fluorescence yield; the qualitative conclusion remains that the two L-alpha peaks are taller than the two K-alpha peaks.\n\nPutting these together, the spectrum will show two distinct groups of peaks: at low energy, Ga L-alpha followed by As L-alpha; at high energy, Ga K-alpha followed by As K-alpha. The L-alpha peaks will be significantly more intense than the K-alpha peaks. Among the provided statements, this exactly matches option A. Option B reverses the order within the L group (incorrect). Option C incorrectly states the K-alpha peaks are most intense. Option D incorrectly states L emissions are too weak to detect. Option E mixes the groups incorrectly, violating $E_{K\\alpha}^{X} > E_{L\\alpha}^{X}$ for each element.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1297292"}, {"introduction": "Obtaining a clean, stable EDS spectrum is not always as simple as placing a sample in the microscope and pressing \"start.\" The physical interaction between the electron beam and the sample material presents practical challenges, especially for electrically insulating materials like ceramics or polymers.

The gold coating acts as a primary emission source, generating additional X-rays that enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for the elements within the YSZ.\n\nB. The gold layer serves as a calibration standard, allowing the EDS software to correct for energy shifts in the detected X-ray peaks from the YSZ.\n\nC. The gold coating prevents the accumulation of negative charge on the insulating sample surface, which would otherwise deflect the incident electron beam and destabilize the X-ray generation process.\n\nD.

The gold coating increases the atomic number contrast of the sample, making it easier to distinguish the YSZ particles from the mounting stub in the SEM image.", "solution": "The SEM-EDS measurement relies on a focused electron beam with kinetic energy $E_{0} = eV_{acc}$ incident on the sample to generate characteristic X-rays via inelastic electron–atom interactions. For a reliable spectrum, the beam’s landing energy and position must be stable, and the X-ray generation volume must be well defined.\n\nFor a non-conductive sample such as YSZ, the electrical conductivity $\\sigma \\approx 0$.
