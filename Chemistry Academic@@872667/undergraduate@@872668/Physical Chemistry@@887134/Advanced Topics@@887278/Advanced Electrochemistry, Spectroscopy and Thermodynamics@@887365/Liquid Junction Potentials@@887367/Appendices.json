This potential is a physical consequence of the different rates at which the various ions diffuse across the boundary between the two solutions.

The potential, therefore, arises from the different diffusion rates of the cations across the boundary. To rank the magnitudes of the potentials, we need to calculate the absolute difference in the ionic mobilities of the non-common cations for each junction.
