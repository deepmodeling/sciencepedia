Consider a hypothetical enzyme that follows the Michaelis-Menten kinetics model. The velocity of the reaction, $v$, is related to the substrate concentration, $[S]$, by the well-established relationship that describes the rate of product formation. The model involves two key parameters: $V_{max}$, the maximum possible reaction velocity when the enzyme is saturated with substrate, and $K_M$, the Michaelis constant, which represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of $V_{max}$.\n\nFor a specific industrial process, it is necessary to maintain the reaction under conditions where it proceeds at a high, but not maximal, efficiency. Your task is to determine the substrate concentration required to achieve a specific reaction rate. Calculate the required substrate concentration, $[S]$, expressed as a multiple of the Michaelis constant, $K_M$, for the reaction to proceed at a velocity $v$ equal to 90% of the maximum velocity $V_{max}$.

We can write this as:\n$$v = 0.90 \\cdot V_{max}$$\n\nStep 3: Substitute the condition into the Michaelis-Menten equation.\nWe replace $v$ in the Michaelis-Menten equation with the expression from Step 2:\n$$0.90 \\cdot V_{max} = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\n\nStep 4: Solve the equation for the substrate concentration $[S]$.\nSince $V_{max}$ is the maximum reaction velocity, it is a non-zero constant. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by $V_{max}$:\n$$0.90 = \\frac{[S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\n\nNow, we perform algebraic manipulation to isolate $[S]$. First, multiply both sides by $(K_M + [S])$:\n$$0.90(K_M + [S]) = [S]$$\n\nDistribute the 0.90 on the left-hand side:\n$$0.90 K_M + 0.90 [S] = [S]$$\n\nNext, we group all terms containing $[S]$ on one side of the equation. Subtract $0.90 [S]$ from both sides:\n$$0.90 K_M = [S] - 0.90 [S]$$\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n$$0.90 K_M = (1 - 0.90) [S]$$\n$$0.90 K_M = 0.10 [S]$$\n\nStep 5: Calculate the final ratio $[S]/K_M$.\nTo find $[S]$ as a multiple of $K_M$, we solve for $[S]$:\n$$[S] = \\frac{0.90}{0.10} K_M$$\n$$[S] = 9 K_M$$\n\nThe problem asks for the value of the ratio $[S]/K_M$.
