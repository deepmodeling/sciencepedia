To predict its spectroscopic properties, the chemist needs to determine its molecular point group. The structure of 1,1-difluoroallene can be described as follows: a chain of three carbon atoms ($C_1=C_2=C_3$) lies on a straight line. This line defines the principal axis of the molecule. The central carbon atom, $C_2$, forms double bonds with the two terminal carbon atoms, $C_1$ and $C_3$. The first terminal carbon, $C_1$, is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The plane containing the $H-C_1-H$ atoms and the molecular axis is perpendicular to the plane containing the $F-C_3-F$ atoms and the molecular axis.\n\nBased on this geometric description, identify the correct molecular point group for 1,1-difluoroallene from the options below.\n\nA. $C_{2v}$\n\nB. $C_{2h}$\n\nC. $D_{2d}$\n\nD. $C_s$\n\nE. $C_2$\n\nF. $D_{2h}$", "solution": "Define the molecular axis as the straight line through the three carbon atoms $C_{1}=C_{2}=C_{3}$; call this the $z$-axis.

At $C_{1}$ the two substituents are identical (both H), and at $C_{3}$ the two substituents are identical (both F), but the two ends differ from each other (H versus F).\n\nIdentify symmetry elements:\n\n1) Identity $E$ is always present.\n\n2) A $C_{2}$ rotation about the $z$-axis, $C_{2}(z)$: A rotation by $180^{\\circ}$ about the $z$-axis swaps the two H atoms at $C_{1}$ (which are identical) and swaps the two F atoms at $C_{3}$ (which are identical), while leaving the carbon backbone on the $z$-axis unchanged.

Place the $C_{1}$–$H_{1}$–$H_{2}$ methylene group (at $z>0$) in the $xz$-plane (so those atoms have $y=0$), and the $C_{2}$–$H_{3}$–$H_{4}$ methylene group (at $z0$) in the $yz$-plane (so those atoms have $x=0$). All $C$–$H$ bond lengths are identical and each methylene is symmetric with respect to its own plane.\n\nTest for inversion $i$ at the origin: inversion maps $(x,y,z)\\to(-x,-y,-z)$. This sends the $xz$-plane at $z>0$ to the $xz$-plane at $z0$, but the actual methylene at $z0$ lies in the $yz$-plane. Therefore $i$ is absent.\n\nTest reflection in the plane perpendicular to the $z$-axis ($\\sigma_{h}$, the $xy$-plane): $(x,y,z)\\to(x,y,-z)$. This would map the upper $xz$-plane methylene to the lower $xz$-plane, but there is no such methylene there (it is in the $yz$-plane). Hence $\\sigma_{h}$ is absent.\n\nTest reflections in planes containing the $z$-axis:\n- Reflection in the $xz$-plane: $(x,y,z)\\to(x,-y,z)$. The upper methylene (in $y=0$) is unchanged; the lower methylene (in $x=0$) has $y\\to -y$, which swaps $H_{3}$ and $H_{4}$ within that identical pair. Thus the $xz$-plane is a symmetry plane.\n- Reflection in the $yz$-plane: $(x,y,z)\\to(-x,y,z)$. Analogously, the lower methylene is unchanged and the upper methylene swaps its two hydrogens. Thus the $yz$-plane is also a symmetry plane.\n\nTest $C_{2}$ about $z$: $(x,y,z)\\to(-x,-y,z)$. Each methylene plane (upper $xz$, lower $yz$) is preserved and the two equivalent hydrogens within each methylene are interchanged. Thus $C_{2}(z)$ is present.\n\nTest $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to $z$:\n- About the $x$-axis: $(x,y,z)\\to(x,-y,-z)$. An atom from the upper $xz$-plane ($y=0$) goes to the lower $xz$-plane, but the actual lower methylene is in the $yz$-plane, so $C_{2}(x)$ is absent.\n- About the $y$-axis: $(x,y,z)\\to(-x,y,-z)$. Similarly, this maps the lower $yz$-plane to the upper $yz$-plane (which does not exist), so $C_{2}(y)$ is absent.\n- About axes in the $xy$-plane along the diagonals: take the unit vector along $x=y$; a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation about this axis maps $(x,y,z)\\to(y,x,-z)$. This sends the upper $xz$-plane ($y=0$) to the lower $yz$-plane ($x=0$) and vice versa, correctly mapping atoms to atoms. Likewise, rotation by $180^{\\circ}$ about the axis along $x=-y$ maps $(x,y,z)\\to(-y,-x,-z)$ and also interchanges the two methylenes correctly. Hence there are two $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to $z$, along $x=\\pm y$.\n\nTest $S_{4}$ along $z$: by definition $S_{4}$ is a rotation by $90^{\\circ}$ about $z$ followed by reflection through the $xy$-plane. The combined mapping is $(x,y,z)\\to(-y,x,-z)$. This takes the upper $xz$-plane methylene into the lower $yz$-plane methylene and vice versa, with atoms mapped onto indistinguishable atoms. Therefore an $S_{4}$ axis along $z$ exists, and $S_{4}^{2}=C_{2}(z)$.\n\nCollecting elements: the molecule has $S_{4}$ along the $z$-axis (with $C_{2}(z)$ as $S_{4}^{2}$), two $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to $z$ (along $x=\\pm y$), and two vertical mirror planes containing $z$ (the $xz$- and $yz$-planes). There is no inversion center and no horizontal mirror plane. This set of elements corresponds to the $D_{2d}$ point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular point group of the $90^{\\circ}$ twisted conformation of ethylene is $D_{2d}$, which corresponds to option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1970087"}, {"introduction": "A powerful method for analyzing complex molecules is to relate them to a more symmetric parent structure. This practice beautifully illustrates the principle of symmetry reduction, where you determine the point group of 1-chloroadamantane by starting with the highly symmetric adamantane cage ($T_d$ symmetry) and identifying which symmetry elements survive the substitution of a single atom [@problem_id:1970056]. This approach of reasoning from high symmetry to low symmetry is an essential problem-solving skill in structural chemistry.", "problem": "Adamantane ($\\text{C}_{10}\\text{H}_{16}$) is a highly symmetric, cage-like hydrocarbon whose carbon skeleton possesses tetrahedral ($T_d$) point group symmetry. Its structure consists of a framework of ten carbon atoms. Four of these are tertiary carbons (methine groups, $-\\text{CH}-$) located at bridgehead positions, and the remaining six are secondary carbons (methylene groups, $-\\text{CH}_2-$) that bridge them.\n\nConsider the molecule that is formed when a single hydrogen atom attached to one of the four equivalent tertiary carbons is substituted with a chlorine atom, yielding 1-chloroadamantane ($\\text{C}_{10}\\text{H}_{15}\\text{Cl}$). By systematically identifying all the symmetry elements of this new molecule, determine its molecular point group. Your answer should be the standard Schoenflies symbol for the point group.", "solution": "Adamantane has a carbon skeleton of $T_{d}$ symmetry with four equivalent tertiary (bridgehead) carbons occupying the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. Replacing one hydrogen on one of these bridgehead carbons with chlorine selects one vertex and breaks any symmetry operation that exchanges this vertex with any of the other three.\n\nFirst, the identity $E$ is always present.\n\nSecond, consider the line through the substituted bridgehead carbon and the center of the tetrahedral carbon skeleton. In adamantane, this is one of the four threefold axes. In the substituted molecule, a rotation by $2\\pi/3$ or $4\\pi/3$ about this axis cyclically permutes the three unsubstituted bridgehead carbons and their associated methylene frameworks into one another while leaving the substituted bridgehead (and the Cl bonded along the axis) fixed. Since these environments are equivalent, both $C_{3}$ and $C_{3}^{2}$ remain valid symmetry operations. Thus there is a principal $C_{3}$ axis retained.\n\nThird, there are three mirror planes containing this $C_{3}$ axis. Each such plane contains the substituted bridgehead carbon, the molecular center, and one of the three equivalent C–C bonds from the substituted bridgehead into the cage; reflection in such a plane exchanges the other two equivalent arms while leaving the axis (and hence the Cl) invariant. Because the three arms are equivalent by construction, each such reflection leaves the entire molecule unchanged. Therefore there are three vertical mirror planes $\\sigma_{v}$.\n\nFourth, no $C_{2}$ axes remain. In $T_{d}$ these $C_{2}$ axes pass through midpoints of opposite edges and necessarily permute vertices of the tetrahedron; any such operation would move the substituted bridgehead carbon to a different bridgehead and thus would exchange Cl with H, which is not allowed. Hence all $C_{2}$ operations are lost. There is no inversion center $i$ (adamantane lacks inversion symmetry and the substitution cannot create one), no horizontal mirror plane $\\sigma_{h}$ (a plane perpendicular to the $C_{3}$ axis would move Cl off its position), and no improper axes $S_{n}$ beyond those implied by the set found.\n\nCollecting the surviving operations gives the group\n$$\nG=\\{E,\\ C_{3},\\ C_{3}^{2},\\ \\sigma_{v1},\\ \\sigma_{v2},\\ \\sigma_{v3}\\},\n$$\nwhich is the $C_{3v}$ point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular point group of 1-chloroadamantane is $C_{3v}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C_{3v}}$$", "id": "1970056"}]}
