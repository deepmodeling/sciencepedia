This practice problem demonstrates the profound impact of this non-stoichiometry on the final polymer product. You will use a more general form of the Carothers equation to see firsthand how even a minor deviation from a 1:1 molar ratio drastically limits the maximum achievable degree of polymerization, a critical consideration for designing syntheses of high-performance materials [@problem_id:1998290].", "problem": "A chemical engineer is synthesizing a high-molecular-weight polyester using a step-growth polymerization process. This process involves the reaction between two different bifunctional monomers, a diol (A-A) and a diacid (B-B).\n\nThe number-average degree of polymerization, $\\bar{X}_n$, is defined as the total number of monomer units (both diol and diacid) incorporated into all polymer chains, divided by the total number of polymer chains present in the final mixture. The progress of the polymerization is characterized by two key parameters:\n1. The stoichiometric ratio, $r$, defined as the initial ratio of the number of molecules of the minority monomer to the majority monomer. By definition, $r \\le 1$.\n2. The extent of reaction, $p$, defined as the fraction of functional groups belonging to the limiting monomer that have reacted.\n\nIn a particular synthesis batch, a weighing error results in a stoichiometric imbalance.
