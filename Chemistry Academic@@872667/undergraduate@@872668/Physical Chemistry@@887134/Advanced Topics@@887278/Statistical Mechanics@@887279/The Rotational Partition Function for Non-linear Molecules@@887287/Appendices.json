Its pure rotational subgroup consists of all proper rotations that map the molecule onto itself, specifically:\n- The identity operation $E$: contributes $1$ element.\n- Four $C_{3}$ axes (through each vertex and the center of the opposite face).

The Boltzmann distribution, governed by the partition function, dictates the population of each energy level at a given temperature.

The sensor operates using microwave absorption spectroscopy to target the rotational transitions of the pollutant molecules. The pollutant molecule has been identified as a prolate symmetric top, meaning it has two distinct moments of inertia, $I_B = I_C$ and a smaller moment of inertia $I_A$. The rotational energy levels of such a molecule are described by two quantum numbers, $J$ and $K$, and are given by the expression:\n$$E_{J,K} = hc[BJ(J+1) + (A-B)K^2]$$\nwhere $J$ is the total angular momentum quantum number ($J=0, 1, 2, ...$) and $K$ is the quantum number for the projection of the angular momentum onto the molecule's principal axis ($K=0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, ..., \\pm J$). The quantities $A$ and $B$ are the rotational constants of the molecule (with $A>B$), $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nTo maximize the sensitivity of the sensor, it must be tuned to the frequency corresponding to a transition originating from the most populated rotational level.

For a symmetric top, each $(J,K)$ level has $(2J+1)$ space-quantization sublevels $M$, so $g_{J,K}$ includes a factor $(2J+1)$. Additionally, because $E_{J,K}$ depends on $K^{2}$, the sublevels $K$ and $-K$ are degenerate; this gives an extra factor of $2$ for $K\\neq 0$ and a factor of $1$ for $K=0$. For fixed $J$, the energy increases with $|K|$ due to the $(A-B)K^{2}$ term (with $A>B$), so the most populated state at a given $J$ is $K=0$.
