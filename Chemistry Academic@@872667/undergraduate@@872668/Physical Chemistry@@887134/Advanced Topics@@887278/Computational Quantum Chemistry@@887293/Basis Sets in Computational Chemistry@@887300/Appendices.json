The Pople-style basis sets are commonly used and have a specific notation that describes their composition.\n\nConsider the `k-LMG` notation for a split-valence basis set:\n- The hyphen separates the description of core and valence orbitals.\n- `k` is an integer representing the number of primitive Gaussian functions that are combined (contracted) to form a single basis function for each core atomic orbital.\n- `LM` describes the valence orbitals. The valence shell is \"split\" into multiple basis functions for greater flexibility. The integers `L`, `M`, ... indicate that each valence atomic orbital is represented by a set of basis functions. The first basis function is a contraction of `L` primitive Gaussians, the second is a contraction of `M` primitive Gaussians, and so on.\n- The letter `G` at the end indicates that Gaussian-type functions are used.\n\nFor example, the 6-31G basis set implies:\n1.  Each core atomic orbital is represented by **one** contracted basis function, formed from 6 primitive Gaussians.\n2.  Each valence atomic orbital is represented by **two** basis functions: an \"inner\" function contracted from 3 primitive Gaussians, and an \"outer\" function consisting of a single primitive Gaussian.\n\nGiven the atomic numbers for Hydrogen (H, Z=1) and Oxygen (O, Z=8), calculate the total number of contracted basis functions for a single water molecule ($H_2O$) when using the 6-31G basis set.

The interaction energy, $\\Delta E_{int}$, is to be calculated as the difference between the total energy of the $Na^+ \\cdots H_2O$ complex and the sum of the energies of the isolated fragments: $\\Delta E_{int} = E_{complex} - (E_{Na^+} + E_{H_2O})$.\n\nFor this task, the chemist decides to use a very large and flexible basis set (an extensive set of atomic orbitals) for the sodium ion, but a minimal basis set (a very small, limited set of atomic orbitals) for the water molecule. This creates a significant imbalance in the quality of the description for the two interacting fragments.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary qualitative error, or artifact, that this imbalanced basis set choice will introduce into the calculated interaction energy, $\\Delta E_{int}$?\n\nA. The calculation will correctly predict a repulsive interaction ($\\Delta E_{int} > 0$) because the minimal basis set on water cannot describe attractive polarization effects.\n\nB.
