Consider one such component, a solid, cylindrically symmetric thermal bridge of length $L$, fabricated from a material with a uniform and temperature-independent thermal conductivity $k$. This component is designed as a frustum of a cone. The radius of its circular cross-section varies linearly along its axis (the x-axis) from a radius $r_1$ at the 'hot' end ($x=0$) to a radius $r_2$ at the 'cold' end ($x=L$).\n\nDuring steady-state operation, the hot end at $x=0$ is maintained at a constant temperature $T_1$, and the cold end at $x=L$ is maintained at a constant temperature $T_2$.

The fundamental principle governing this process is Fourier's Law of heat conduction. In one dimension, the law states that the heat flow rate $H$ is proportional to the cross-sectional area $A$ and the temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dx}$.\n$$ H = -k A(x) \\frac{dT}{dx} $$\nIn this expression, $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the material. The negative sign indicates that heat flows from higher temperature to lower temperature. Since the system is at steady state, the heat flow rate $H$ must be constant for any cross-section along the length of the rod. However, the cross-sectional area $A(x)$ is not constant.\n\nFirst, we must find an expression for the cross-sectional area $A(x)$ as a function of position $x$. The rod is a frustum of a cone, so its radius $r(x)$ varies linearly with position $x$ along its axis. A linear function can be written as $r(x) = mx + c$. We can determine the constants $m$ and $c$ using the given boundary conditions for the radius.\nAt $x=0$, the radius is $r(0) = r_1$. This gives $c = r_1$.\nAt $x=L$, the radius is $r(L) = r_2$. Substituting $c=r_1$, we get $mL + r_1 = r_2$, which gives the slope $m = \\frac{r_2 - r_1}{L}$.\nSo, the radius at any position $x$ is given by:\n$$ r(x) = \\left(\\frac{r_2 - r_1}{L}\\right)x + r_1 $$\nThe cross-sectional area $A(x)$ is the area of a circle with this radius, $A(x) = \\pi [r(x)]^2$.\n$$ A(x) = \\pi \\left[ \\left(\\frac{r_2 - r_1}{L}\\right)x + r_1 \\right]^2 $$\nNow we can substitute this expression for $A(x)$ back into Fourier's Law:\n$$ H = -k \\pi \\left[ \\left(\\frac{r_2 - r_1}{L}\\right)x + r_1 \\right]^2 \\frac{dT}{dx} $$\nTo find the total heat flow rate $H$, we need to solve this differential equation.

The position $x$ varies from $0$ to $L$, while the temperature $T$ varies from $T_1$ to $T_2$. Since $H$, $k$, and $\\pi$ are constants, we can take them out of the integral.\n$$ \\frac{H}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{dx}{\\left[ \\left(\\frac{r_2 - r_1}{L}\\right)x + r_1 \\right]^2} = -k \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} dT $$\nThe integral on the right side is straightforward:\n$$ -k \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} dT = -k [T]_{T_1}^{T_2} = -k(T_2 - T_1) = k(T_1 - T_2) $$\nThe integral on the left side can be solved using a u-substitution.
