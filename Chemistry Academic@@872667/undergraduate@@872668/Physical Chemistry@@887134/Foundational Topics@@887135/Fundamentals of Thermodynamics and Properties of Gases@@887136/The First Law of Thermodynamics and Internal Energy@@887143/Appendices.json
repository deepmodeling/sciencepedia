Before diving into calculations, it's crucial to build a strong conceptual intuition for these quantities, particularly the sign conventions.

During the charging process, the station's power supply performs electrical work on the vehicle's lithium-ion battery pack. Simultaneously, inefficiencies in the charging process cause the battery pack to heat up and dissipate thermal energy into the surrounding environment.\n\nConsider the battery pack as the thermodynamic system.

Adopt the standard physical chemistry sign convention: $q$ is positive when heat is absorbed by the system, and $w$ is positive when work is done on the system. The first law of thermodynamics is written as $\\Delta U = q + w$.\n\nDuring fast charging, the external power supply performs electrical work on the battery, so the work term for the system is positive, hence $w  0$. Due to inefficiencies, the battery dissipates thermal energy to the surroundings; heat flows out of the system, so $q  0$. Because the process is a net charging process, the battery’s stored chemical/electrostatic energy increases, which implies that the internal energy increases. Using $\\Delta U = q + w$ with $w  0$ and $q  0$, and recognizing that charging leads to a net gain of stored energy, we conclude $\\Delta U  0$.\n\nTherefore, the correct signs are $q  0$, $w  0$, and $\\Delta U  0$, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2011336"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of thermodynamics is the distinction between state functions and path functions.
