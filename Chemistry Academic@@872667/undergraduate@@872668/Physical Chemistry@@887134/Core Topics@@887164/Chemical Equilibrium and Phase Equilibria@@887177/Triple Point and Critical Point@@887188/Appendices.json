Therefore, the average density of the substance in the container, $\\rho_{avg} = m/V$, remains constant throughout the heating process. This constant-volume, constant-mass process is represented by a vertical line (an isochore) on a Temperature-Specific Volume diagram or a Density-Temperature diagram.\n\nThe fate of the two-phase system upon heating depends on how this average density $\\rho_{avg}$ compares to the critical density $\\rho_c$. As the system is heated, the density of the liquid phase, $\\rho_l$, decreases due to thermal expansion, while the density of the vapor phase, $\\rho_v$, increases due to more molecules entering the gas phase and increasing pressure. The system will transition to a single phase at the point where the constant average density line intersects the phase boundary dome.\n\n1.  If $\\rho_{avg}  \\rho_c$, the system has a relatively low overall density. To maintain this low average density as $\\rho_l$ decreases and $\\rho_v$ increases, the fraction of the substance in the less dense vapor phase must increase. This means the liquid evaporates. Visually, the meniscus separating the liquid and vapor will fall until all the liquid is consumed, leaving a single gas phase.\n\n2.  If $\\rho_{avg} > \\rho_c$, the system has a relatively high overall density. To maintain this high average density, the fraction of the substance in the denser liquid phase must increase. This means the vapor condenses. Visually, the meniscus will rise as the liquid expands and fills the container, leaving a single liquid phase.\n\n3.  If $\\rho_{avg} = \\rho_c$, the path leads directly to the critical point. As the temperature approaches the critical temperature $T_c$, the densities of the liquid and vapor phases converge towards $\\rho_c$. The meniscus becomes indistinct and disappears exactly at the critical point, forming a single supercritical fluid.\n\nWe must calculate the average density for each experiment and compare it to the critical density of $\\text{CO}_2$, $\\rho_c = 467.6 \\text{ kg/m}^3$.\n\nFirst, we convert the volume of the vessel to SI units:\n$V = 2.50 \\text{ L} = 2.50 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}^3$.\n\n**Analysis of Experiment A:**\nThe total mass of $\\text{CO}_2$ is $m_A = 0.950 \\text{ kg}$.\nThe average density in Experiment A is:\n$$ \\rho_A = \\frac{m_A}{V} = \\frac{0.950 \\text{ kg}}{2.50 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}^3} = 380 \\text{ kg/m}^3 $$\nNow we compare $\\rho_A$ to the critical density $\\rho_c$:\n$$ 380 \\text{ kg/m}^3  467.6 \\text{ kg/m}^3 $$\nSince $\\rho_A  \\rho_c$, the initial filling density is lower than the critical density. As the vessel is heated, the liquid will evaporate to increase the density of the vapor phase. The liquid level (meniscus) will fall, and eventually, all the liquid will have turned into gas. The system becomes a single gas phase.\n\n**Analysis of Experiment B:**\nThe total mass of $\\text{CO}_2$ is $m_B = 1.35 \\text{ kg}$.\nThe average density in Experiment B is:\n$$ \\rho_B = \\frac{m_B}{V} = \\frac{1.35 \\text{ kg}}{2.50 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}^3} = 540 \\text{ kg/m}^3 $$\nNow we compare $\\rho_B$ to the critical density $\\rho_c$:\n$$ 540 \\text{ kg/m}^3 > 467.6 \\text{ kg/m}^3 $$\nSince $\\rho_B > \\rho_c$, the initial filling density is higher than the critical density. As the vessel is heated, the liquid expands. To maintain the high average density, the vapor must condense into the liquid phase. The liquid level (meniscus) will rise until it completely fills the container. The system becomes a single liquid phase.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn Experiment A, the meniscus falls until only gas remains.\nIn Experiment B, the meniscus rises until only liquid remains.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2027660"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a conceptual picture to a quantitative model, this problem utilizes the van der Waals equation of state to predict a substance's critical properties.
