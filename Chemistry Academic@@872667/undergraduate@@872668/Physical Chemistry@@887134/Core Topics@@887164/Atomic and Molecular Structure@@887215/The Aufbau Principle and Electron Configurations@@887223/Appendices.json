A neutral atom has $Z$ electrons, so there are $12$ electrons to place. Using the Aufbau principle (filling orbitals in order of increasing energy: $1s$, $2s$, $2p$, $3s$, $3p$, \\dots), the ground-state configuration is\n$$\n1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}.\n$$\nNow compare this with the given configuration $1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{1}\\,3p^{1}$. Count the electrons:\n$$\n2+2+6+1+1=12,\n$$\nso the configuration corresponds to a neutral atom of the element with $Z=12$. Relative orbital energies within the $n=3$ shell satisfy $E(3s)E(3p)$. Therefore, the presence of an electron in $3p$ while $3s$ is not fully filled indicates that one electron has been promoted from the lower-energy $3s$ to the higher-energy $3p$ orbital. This is characteristic of an excited state, not the ground state, so option A is false.\n\nCheck the Pauli Exclusion Principle: no orbital contains more than two electrons, and there is no requirement violated by having one electron in $3s$ and one in $3p$. Thus there is no Pauli violation, so option C is false.\n\nCheck Hund’s rule within the $3p$ subshell: with only one electron in $3p$, it occupies one of the three degenerate $p$ orbitals singly, which is consistent with Hund’s rule. There is no violation, so option D is false.\n\nFinally, since the total number of electrons equals $Z$, the species is neutral and not an ion, so option E is false.\n\nThe configuration therefore represents an excited state in which one electron occupies the higher-energy $3p$ orbital while the lower-energy $3s$ orbital is only partially filled.

The spin-only magnetic moment is $\\mu_{\\text{so}}=\\sqrt{n(n+2)}\\mu_{B}$, which increases monotonically with the number $n$ of unpaired electrons, so the species with the largest $n$ is the most strongly attracted to a magnetic field.\n\nUsing the first-row transition-metal configurations and Hund’s rule (maximizing spin by singly occupying different $d$ orbitals before pairing):\n- $\\text{Sc}$: neutral $\\left[\\text{Ar}\\right]\\,3d^{1}4s^{2}$, so $\\text{Sc}^{2+}:\\left[\\text{Ar}\\right]\\,3d^{1}$ with $n=1$.\n- $\\text{Ti}$: neutral $\\left[\\text{Ar}\\right]\\,3d^{2}4s^{2}$, so $\\text{Ti}^{2+}:\\left[\\text{Ar}\\right]\\,3d^{2}$ with $n=2$.\n- $\\text{V}$: neutral $\\left[\\text{Ar}\\right]\\,3d^{3}4s^{2}$, so $\\text{V}^{2+}:\\left[\\text{Ar}\\right]\\,3d^{3}$ with $n=3$.\n- $\\text{Cr}$: neutral $\\left[\\text{Ar}\\right]\\,3d^{5}4s^{1}$, so $\\text{Cr}^{2+}:\\left[\\text{Ar}\\right]\\,3d^{4}$ with $n=4$.\n- $\\text{Mn}$: neutral $\\left[\\text{Ar}\\right]\\,3d^{5}4s^{2}$, so $\\text{Mn}^{2+}:\\left[\\text{Ar}\\right]\\,3d^{5}$ with $n=5$.\n\nSince $n$ is largest for $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$, it is the most strongly paramagnetic among the options.
