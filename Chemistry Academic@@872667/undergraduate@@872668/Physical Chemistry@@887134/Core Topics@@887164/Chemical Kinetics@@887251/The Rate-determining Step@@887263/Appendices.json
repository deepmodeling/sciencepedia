The rate of a multi-step reaction is governed by the rate of its slowest step, the RDS. We will test the two main possibilities: Step 1 being the RDS and Step 2 being the RDS.\n\nFirst, we verify that the proposed mechanism is stoichiometrically correct. Summing the two elementary steps:\n$$(\\mathrm{X} + \\mathrm{Y} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{I}) + (\\mathrm{X} + \\mathrm{I} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Z})$$\nThe intermediate I appears on both the product side of Step 1 and the reactant side of Step 2, so it cancels out.\n$$2\\mathrm{X} + \\mathrm{Y} + \\mathrm{I} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{I} + \\mathrm{Z}$$\n$$2\\mathrm{X} + \\mathrm{Y} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Z}$$\nThe sum of the elementary steps correctly yields the overall reaction equation.\n\nNow, let's analyze the kinetics under two different hypotheses.\n\n**Hypothesis 1: Step 1 is the rate-determining step.**\nIf Step 1 is the slow step (RDS), then Step 2 must be fast. The overall rate of the reaction is determined by the rate of the slow step. The rate of the elementary reaction in Step 1 is given by its rate law:\n$$\\text{rate} = \\text{rate}_1 = k_1[\\mathrm{X}][\\mathrm{Y}]$$\nThis theoretical rate law is first-order in [X] and first-order in [Y]. This form matches the experimentally observed rate law, $\\text{rate} = k[\\mathrm{X}][\\mathrm{Y}]$. In this case, the observed rate constant $k$ would be equal to the elementary rate constant $k_1$. Therefore, assuming Step 1 is the RDS is consistent with the experimental data.\n\n**Hypothesis 2: Step 2 is the rate-determining step.**\nIf Step 2 is the slow step (RDS), then Step 1 must be fast. A fast initial step that is followed by a slow step is often assumed to be in a state of rapid equilibrium. This is the pre-equilibrium approximation. For Step 1, this means its forward and reverse reactions are occurring quickly and at nearly equal rates. Let the reverse rate constant for Step 1 be $k_{-1}$.\n$$\\mathrm{X} + \\mathrm{Y} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\mathrm{I} \\quad \\text{(fast equilibrium)}$$\nThe overall rate of reaction is determined by the rate of the slow Step 2:\n$$\\text{rate} = \\text{rate}_2 = k_2[\\mathrm{X}][\\mathrm{I}]$$\nThis rate law includes the concentration of the intermediate, [I], which is not experimentally measurable and should not appear in the final rate law. We must express [I] in terms of the concentrations of the original reactants. Using the pre-equilibrium approximation for Step 1, we set the rate of the forward reaction equal to the rate of the reverse reaction:\n$$\\text{rate}_{\\text{forward}, 1} = \\text{rate}_{\\text{reverse}, 1}$$\n$$k_1[\\mathrm{X}][\\mathrm{Y}] = k_{-1}[\\mathrm{I}]$$\nNow, we solve for the concentration of the intermediate, [I]:\n$$[\\mathrm{I}] = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}[\\mathrm{X}][\\mathrm{Y}]$$\nSubstitute this expression for [I] into the rate law for Step 2:\n$$\\text{rate} = k_2[\\mathrm{X}] \\left( \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}[\\mathrm{X}][\\mathrm{Y}] \\right) = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[\\mathrm{X}]^2[\\mathrm{Y}]$$\nThis derived rate law predicts that the reaction should be second-order in X and first-order in Y. This contradicts the experimental rate law, $\\text{rate} = k[\\mathrm{X}][\\mathrm{Y}]$, which is first-order in X. Therefore, the assumption that Step 2 is the RDS is inconsistent with the experimental data.\n\nBased on our analysis of the two hypotheses, only the assumption that Step 1 is the rate-determining step yields a rate law that is consistent with the experimental observation. Therefore, Step 1 must be the slow step of the reaction.
