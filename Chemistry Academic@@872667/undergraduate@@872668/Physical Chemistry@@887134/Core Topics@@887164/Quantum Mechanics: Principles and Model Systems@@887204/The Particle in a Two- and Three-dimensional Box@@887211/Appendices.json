The first step is to write down the normalized wavefunction for such a system. The general solution to the Schrödinger equation for a 2D box with side lengths $L_x$ and $L_y$ is given by the separation of variables, leading to:\n$$\n\\psi_{n_x, n_y}(x, y) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L_x}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n_x \\pi x}{L_x}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L_y}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n_y \\pi y}{L_y}\\right)\n$$\nFor a square box as specified in the problem, we have $L_x = L_y = L$.
