The crystal structure is such that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the X-Z bond axis of every molecule is fixed in a specific orientation relative to the crystal lattice.

At a specific high temperature, the equilibrium ratio of the more stable keto form to the less stable enol form is precisely 9 to 1. A sample of this compound is rapidly cooled to a temperature approaching absolute zero, forming a crystalline solid. During this rapid cooling process, the individual molecules do not have time to reorient or convert, and they become \"frozen\" in their high-temperature tautomeric states.
