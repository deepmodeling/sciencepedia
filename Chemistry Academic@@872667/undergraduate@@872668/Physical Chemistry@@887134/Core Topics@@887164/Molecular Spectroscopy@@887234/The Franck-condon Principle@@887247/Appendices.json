The potential energy curves for both the ground electronic state and the first excited electronic state can be accurately modeled as harmonic oscillators. Spectroscopic analysis reveals a remarkable property of XF: the equilibrium internuclear distance and the fundamental vibrational frequency of the excited electronic state are nearly identical to those of the ground electronic state.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements best describes the expected appearance of the vibrational fine structure in the electronic absorption spectrum of XF, originating from the $v'' = 0$ level?\n\nA.

This molecule is being considered for use in a new generation of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The investigation involves an absorption experiment where the molecule, initially in its ground electronic state and lowest vibrational level ($v''=0$), is excited to its first excited electronic state by a photon.\n\nThrough computational modeling, the potential energy curves for the ground electronic state ($V''$) and the first excited electronic state ($V'$) are approximated as harmonic oscillators.

The transition will be to a dissociative continuum of the excited state, resulting in a single, very broad absorption band with no discernible vibrational structure.\n\nE. All observed vibrational transitions ($v''=0 \\to v'$) will have approximately equal intensity.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the vibrational structure of an electronic absorption spectrum based on the Franck-Condon principle and the given equilibrium bond lengths of the ground and excited states.\n\nStep 1: Understand the Franck-Condon Principle.\nThe Franck-Condon principle states that electronic transitions occur on a timescale much shorter than the period of nuclear motion. As a result, the internuclear distance and the momenta of the nuclei do not change during the transition. On a potential energy versus internuclear distance diagram, this is represented as a \"vertical transition\".\n\nStep 2: Characterize the Initial State.\nThe molecule is initially in its ground electronic state and the lowest vibrational level ($v''=0$). For a quantum harmonic oscillator, the probability density function for the ground state, $|\\psi_{v''=0}(r)|^2$, is centered at the equilibrium bond length, $r_e''$. This means the most probable internuclear distance for the molecule in its initial state is $r = r_e'' = 131 \\text{ pm}$.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the Vertical Transition.\nAccording to the Franck-Condon principle, the most probable electronic transition will originate from the most probable nuclear configuration of the initial state. Therefore, the transition will occur vertically from the point $(r=r_e'', V''(r_e''))$ on the ground state potential energy curve. This vertical line intersects the excited state potential energy curve, $V'(r)$, at the same internuclear distance, $r = 131 \\text{ pm}$.\n\nStep 4: Examine the Final State on the Excited Potential Energy Curve.\nThe equilibrium bond length of the excited state is $r_e' = 115 \\text{ pm}$. The vertical transition terminates at $r = 131 \\text{ pm}$ on the excited state curve. Since $r_e' < r_e''$ ($115 \\text{ pm} < 131 \\text{ pm}$), the transition ends on the outer, repulsive wall of the excited state's potential well, significantly displaced from its minimum.\n\nStep 5: Relate Transition Probability to Wavefunction Overlap.\nThe intensity of a particular vibronic transition ($v'' \\to v'$) is proportional to the square of the overlap integral between the initial and final vibrational wavefunctions, $|\\int \\psi_{v'}^*(r) \\psi_{v''}(r) dr|^2$. This is known as the Franck-Condon factor. For our case, the initial state is $\\psi_{v''=0}$, which has its maximum amplitude at $r=r_e''$. To have a large overlap, the final state wavefunction, $\\psi_{v'}(r)$, must also have a significant amplitude at this same position, $r=r_e''$.\n\nStep 6: Determine the Most Likely Final Vibrational Level ($v'$).\nLet's consider the wavefunctions of the excited state.\n- The ground vibrational wavefunction of the excited state, $\\psi_{v'=0}(r)$, has its maximum amplitude at the minimum of the potential well, $r_e' = 115 \\text{ pm}$. This position is far from the transition coordinate $r = 131 \\text{ pm}$. Therefore, the overlap between $\\psi_{v''=0}$ and $\\psi_{v'=0}$ will be small, resulting in a low-intensity $0-0$ transition.\n- For higher vibrational levels ($v'>0$), the wavefunctions have significant amplitudes near the classical turning points (the points on the potential curve where the total energy equals the potential energy). The vertical transition terminates at $r = 131 \\text{ pm}$ on the outer wall of the $V'$ potential. This point will be a classical turning point for some intermediate vibrational level, let's call it $v'_{max}$. The wavefunction for this level, $\\psi_{v'_{max}}(r)$, will have a large amplitude at $r = 131 \\text{ pm}$.\n- Consequently, the overlap integral $|\\langle \\psi_{v'_{max}} | \\psi_{v''=0} \\rangle|^2$ will be maximized for this intermediate $v'_{max}$, leading to the most intense transition. The intensity will be lower for transitions to $v'$ levels both below and above $v'_{max}$.\n- The transition does not necessarily lead to dissociation (Option D) unless the vertical transition energy exceeds the dissociation energy of the excited state, which is not stated. A distinct vibrational progression is expected.\n- Option C is too strong; the overlap for the 0-0 transition is small, not necessarily zero.\n- Option E is incorrect because the overlap integrals will vary significantly with $v'$.\n\nConclusion: The absorption spectrum will show a progression of peaks. The $0-0$ transition will be present but weak. The intensity will rise to a maximum for a transition to an intermediate vibrational level ($v'>0$) and then fall off for higher $v'$ values.
