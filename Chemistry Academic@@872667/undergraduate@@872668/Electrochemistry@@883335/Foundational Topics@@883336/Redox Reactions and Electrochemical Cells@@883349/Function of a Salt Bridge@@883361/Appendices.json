There is no net movement of ions within the salt bridge, as its purpose is only to complete the electrical circuit for electrons.", "solution": "To determine ion movement in the salt bridge, first identify the anode and cathode from the standard reduction potentials.

Therefore, the spontaneous cell reactions are:\n$$\n\\text{Anode (oxidation): } Zn(s) \\rightarrow Zn^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Cathode (reduction): } Ag^{+}(aq) + e^{-} \\rightarrow Ag(s)\n$$\nand the net reaction is:\n$$\nZn(s) + 2Ag^{+}(aq) \\rightarrow Zn^{2+}(aq) + 2Ag(s).\n$$\n\nNext, use the principle that the salt bridge maintains electroneutrality: anions migrate toward the anode, and cations migrate toward the cathode. Specifically:\n- In the zinc half-cell (anode), oxidation produces $Zn^{2+}$, increasing positive charge in solution; to counterbalance, anions from the salt bridge must enter this half-cell. Thus $\\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$ migrates toward the zinc half-cell.\n- In the silver half-cell (cathode), $Ag^{+}$ is consumed by reduction, decreasing the concentration of cations and leaving an excess of negative charge; to counterbalance, cations from the salt bridge must enter this half-cell. Thus $K^{+}$ migrates toward the silver half-cell.\n\nTherefore, potassium ions move toward the silver half-cell and nitrate ions move toward the zinc half-cell, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1562578"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how a salt bridge functions ideally, let's explore what happens when it's improperly constructed—a common mistake in a laboratory setting.

Therefore, A does not explain the observed transient to zero.\n\nAnalyze option B (reversed leads). Reversing the voltmeter connections changes only the sign of the measured potential:\n$$\nV_{\\text{measured}} = -E_{\\text{cell}}\n$$\nThe magnitude remains the same and does not go to zero. Hence, B is not the cause.\n\nAnalyze option D (low-impedance voltmeter). With a load resistance $R_{m}$ and internal resistance $R_{\\text{int}}$, the terminal voltage under load is:\n$$\nV = E_{\\text{cell}} \\frac{R_{m}}{R_{\\text{int}} + R_{m}}\n$$\nIf $R_{m}$ were very small (short circuit), then $V \\approx 0$ immediately, not after an initial near-theoretical reading. Moreover, the problem explicitly states a high-impedance voltmeter. Thus, D does not match the observation.\n\nAnalyze option E (oxidized Cd surface). Overpotentials and kinetic hindrance affect the cell under load, not the open-circuit potential. At essentially zero current with a high-impedance meter, the overpotentials vanish:\n$$\nV_{\\text{oc}} \\approx E_{\\text{cell}} - \\eta_{\\text{anode}} - \\eta_{\\text{cathode}} \\approx E_{\\text{cell}}\n$$\nTherefore, oxidation of the Cd surface would not drive the measured voltage to zero. E is not consistent.\n\nAnalyze option C (U-tube filled with deionized water instead of a concentrated inert salt solution). A proper salt bridge provides high ionic conductivity and minimizes liquid junction potentials by using an inert electrolyte with nearly equal ion mobilities. If deionized water is used instead:\n- The ionic conductivity of the bridge is extremely low, so charge balance between half-cells cannot be maintained by ion migration.\n- Upon connecting the external circuit, a tiny transient current flows and charges the interfacial double layers, building opposing polarization and liquid junction potentials across the water interfaces. The effective circuit is a very large resistance in series with interfacial capacitances, so the meter initially reads near $E_{\\text{cell}}$ but then the potential across the deionized-water junctions grows until it cancels the electrode EMF:\n$$\nV_{\\text{meter}}(t) = E_{\\text{cell}} - V_{\\text{junction/polarization}}(t) \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n- With a concentrated inert salt bridge, this cancellation does not occur; the EMF remains stable and near $E^{\\circ}$ under standard conditions.\n\nThis behavior—an initial near-theoretical potential that rapidly decays to and stabilizes at zero—is characteristic of using an improper salt bridge medium (deionized water) that fails to maintain ionic continuity and produces large, evolving junction/polarization potentials.

The cell will operate normally with an initial voltage of 1.10 V, as the salt bridge ions are inert with respect to the electrode materials.\n\nB. The cell potential will rapidly drop to zero because the formation of a precipitate prevents the maintenance of charge neutrality in one of the half-cells.\n\nC. The cell will operate, but its initial voltage will be significantly lower than 1.10 V because the precipitation reaction consumes ions that would otherwise contribute to conductivity.\n\nD. The roles of anode and cathode will be reversed from what is predicted by the standard potentials, with copper being oxidized and zinc being reduced.\n\nE. A layer of barium metal will be deposited onto the copper electrode because the Ba²⁺ ions will be preferentially reduced over the Cu²⁺ ions.\n\nF. The cell voltage will slowly increase over time as the precipitation of $\\text{BaSO}_4$ removes sulfate ions, shifting the cathode reaction equilibrium according to Le Châtelier's principle.", "solution": "Step 1: Determine the anode and cathode of the galvanic cell.\nThe half-reaction with the more positive (or less negative) standard reduction potential will be the reduction half-reaction, occurring at the cathode.

Anions from the salt bridge flow into the anode compartment to balance the positive charge created by oxidation, and cations from the salt bridge flow into the cathode compartment to balance the negative charge left behind by reduction.\nThe salt bridge contains barium nitrate, $\\text{Ba(NO}_3)_2$, which dissociates into Ba²⁺ cations and $\\text{NO}_3^-$ anions.\n\n- Anode Compartment (Zn in $\\text{Zn(NO}_3)_2$): Zn is oxidized to Zn²⁺, increasing the concentration of positive ions. To maintain neutrality, anions from the salt bridge, $\\text{NO}_3^-$, must flow into this compartment. Zinc nitrate is soluble, so no reaction occurs.\n- Cathode Compartment (Cu in $\\text{CuSO}_4$): Cu²⁺ is reduced to Cu(s), removing positive ions from the solution. This leaves an excess of sulfate anions ($\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$). To maintain neutrality, cations from the salt bridge, Ba²⁺, must flow into this compartment.\n\nStep 4: Identify and analyze the consequence of the chemical reaction in the cathode compartment.\nAs Ba²⁺ ions from the salt bridge enter the cathode compartment, they encounter the $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ ions from the copper sulfate electrolyte. The problem states that barium sulfate ($\\text{BaSO}_4$) is a nearly insoluble salt. Therefore, a precipitation reaction will occur:\nBa²⁺(aq) + $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$(aq) → $\\text{BaSO}_4$(s)\n\nStep 5: Determine the effect of this precipitation on cell function.\nThe purpose of the Ba²⁺ ions flowing into the cathode compartment is to replenish the positive charge lost by the reduction of Cu²⁺. However, because the Ba²⁺ ions are immediately removed from the solution as a solid precipitate, they fail to achieve this. The reduction of Cu²⁺ continues for a very short time, leading to a build-up of uncompensated negative charge (excess $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ ions). This accumulation of negative charge in the cathode compartment creates an electrostatic potential that opposes the flow of electrons to the cathode. As a result, the flow of current stops, and the cell potential rapidly drops to zero. The cell ceases to operate.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\nA. Incorrect. The cell will not operate normally because the precipitation reaction prevents the salt bridge from functioning correctly.\nB. Correct. The formation of $\\text{BaSO}_4$ precipitate prevents the Ba²⁺ ions from balancing the charge in the cathode compartment. This \"blocks\" the circuit by stopping ion migration, leading to a rapid drop in potential to zero.\nC. Incorrect. The effect is not merely a reduction in voltage; it's a complete and rapid cessation of cell function. The potential doesn't just get lower, it drops to zero.\nD. Incorrect. The inherent chemical properties (standard potentials) dictate the roles of anode and cathode. The side reaction in the salt bridge does not reverse these fundamental roles.\nE. Incorrect. The standard reduction potential of Ba²⁺ to Ba is extremely negative (approx. -2.91 V), making it much harder to reduce than Cu²⁺ ($+0.34$ V). Cu²⁺ will be reduced exclusively.\nF. Incorrect. The cell potential will not increase; it will plummet. While removing sulfate could theoretically shift the equilibrium, the primary effect is the failure of the salt bridge to maintain charge neutrality, which is catastrophic for cell operation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1562607"}]}
