The reaction takes place in an acidic solution.\n\n**Step 1: Assign oxidation states to identify oxidation and reduction.**\n\nFirst, we determine the oxidation state of the relevant atoms (carbon and chromium) in the reactants and products. We use the rules that oxygen has an oxidation state of -2 and hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1.\n\nFor ethanol ($CH_3CH_2OH$):\nThe overall charge is 0. Let the average oxidation state of carbon be $x$.\n$2x + 6(+1) + 1(-2) = 0$\n$2x + 4 = 0 \\implies x = -2$.\n\nFor acetic acid ($CH_3COOH$):\nThe overall charge is 0. Let the average oxidation state of carbon be $y$.\n$2y + 4(+1) + 2(-2) = 0$\n$2y = 0 \\implies y = 0$.\nThe average oxidation state of carbon increases from -2 to 0. This is an oxidation process. Since ethanol is oxidized, it is the **reducing agent**.\n\nFor the dichromate ion ($Cr_2O_7^{2-}$):\nThe overall charge is -2. Let the oxidation state of chromium be $z$.\n$2z + 7(-2) = -2$\n$2z - 14 = -2 \\implies 2z = +12 \\implies z = +6$.\n\nFor the chromium(III) ion ($Cr^{3+}$):\nThe oxidation state of chromium is simply its charge, which is +3.\nThe oxidation state of chromium decreases from +6 to +3. This is a reduction process. Since the dichromate ion is reduced, it is the **oxidizing agent**.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement A is incorrect because it misidentifies the oxidizing and reducing agents.\n\n**Step 2: Write and balance the half-reactions in acidic solution.**\n\n**Oxidation Half-Reaction:** Ethanol to Acetic Acid\n1.  Write the unbalanced species:\n    $CH_3CH_2OH \\rightarrow CH_3COOH$\n2.  Balance atoms other than O and H. There are 2 carbon atoms on each side, so they are balanced.\n3.  Balance O atoms by adding $H_2O$:\n    $CH_3CH_2OH + H_2O \\rightarrow CH_3COOH$\n    (Left side has $1+1=2$ oxygen atoms; right side has 2 oxygen atoms. Balanced.)\n4.  Balance H atoms by adding $H^+$:\n    $CH_3CH_2OH + H_2O \\rightarrow CH_3COOH + 4H^+$\n    (Left side has $6+2=8$ hydrogen atoms; right side has $4+4=8$ hydrogen atoms. Balanced.)\n5.  Balance the charge by adding electrons ($e^-$):\n    $CH_3CH_2OH + H_2O \\rightarrow CH_3COOH + 4H^+ + 4e^-$\n    (Left side has a net charge of 0. Right side has a net charge of $+4$. Adding 4 electrons to the right side balances the charge to 0.)\nThe balanced oxidation half-reaction involves the transfer of 4 electrons. Therefore, statement B, which suggests a 2-electron transfer, is incorrect.\n\n**Reduction Half-Reaction:** Dichromate to Chromium(III)\n1.  Write the unbalanced species:\n    $Cr_2O_7^{2-} \\rightarrow Cr^{3+}$\n2.  Balance atoms other than O and H:\n    $Cr_2O_7^{2-} \\rightarrow 2Cr^{3+}$\n    (2 chromium atoms on each side.)\n3.  Balance O atoms by adding $H_2O$:\n    $Cr_2O_7^{2-} \\rightarrow 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O$\n    (7 oxygen atoms on each side.)\n4.  Balance H atoms by adding $H^+$:\n    $Cr_2O_7^{2-} + 14H^+ \\rightarrow 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O$\n    (14 hydrogen atoms on each side.)\n5.  Balance the charge by adding electrons ($e^-$):\n    $Cr_2O_7^{2-} + 14H^+ + 6e^- \\rightarrow 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O$\n    (Left side net charge: $(-2) + (+14) = +12$. Right side net charge: $2(+3) = +6$. Adding 6 electrons to the left side balances the charge to +6.)\nThis is the correctly balanced reduction half-reaction. Thus, statement C is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the remaining statements.**\n\nStatement D claims that for every mole of dichromate, four moles of electrons are transferred. Our balanced reduction half-reaction shows that 6 moles of electrons are transferred per mole of $Cr_2O_7^{2-}$. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.\n\nStatement E claims that one mole of ethanol reacts with one mole of dichromate. To check this, we must balance the overall reaction by equalizing the electrons transferred in the two half-reactions.\nOxidation: $CH_3CH_2OH + H_2O \\rightarrow CH_3COOH + 4H^+ + 4e^-$\nReduction: $Cr_2O_7^{2-} + 14H^+ + 6e^- \\rightarrow 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O$\nThe least common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12.
