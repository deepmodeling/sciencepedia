The acidity of the solution is caused by the production of hydronium ions ($H_3O^+$). Any substance that increases the concentration of ions in solution is a strong electrolyte, and the generation of $H_3O^+$ fulfills this condition.", "solution": "The question asks for the correct justification for classifying ammonium chloride ($NH_4Cl$) as a strong electrolyte, even though its aqueous solution is weakly acidic. This requires a clear understanding of the definitions of strong electrolytes, weak electrolytes, and acid-base behavior of salts (hydrolysis).\n\nFirst, let's define a strong electrolyte. A strong electrolyte is a substance that, when dissolved in a solvent like water, dissociates completely (or nearly completely) into its constituent ions. This complete dissociation results in a high concentration of mobile ions, making the solution an excellent conductor of electricity.\n\nNow, let's analyze the behavior of ammonium chloride in water. Being an ionic salt, $NH_4Cl$ undergoes a dissociation process when it dissolves. This process is effectively irreversible and complete:\n$$NH_4Cl(s) \\xrightarrow{H_2O} NH_4^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)$$\nBecause every formula unit of $NH_4Cl$ that dissolves breaks apart into an ammonium ion ($NH_4^+$) and a chloride ion ($Cl^-$), the salt is classified as a strong electrolyte. The high concentration of these ions makes the solution highly conductive.\n\nNext, we must address the observation that the solution is weakly acidic. This acidity is not due to the initial dissociation but rather a subsequent, secondary reaction called hydrolysis. The ions produced from the dissociation can potentially react with water.\n- The chloride ion, $Cl^-$, is the conjugate base of a strong acid ($HCl$). It is a very weak base and does not react with water to any significant extent. It remains in the solution as a spectator ion.\n- The ammonium ion, $NH_4^+$, is the conjugate acid of a weak base ($NH_3$). It is a weak acid and will react with water in an equilibrium to produce hydronium ions ($H_3O^+$):\n$$NH_4^+(aq) + H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons NH_3(aq) + H_3O^+(aq)$$\nThis is an equilibrium process, and since $NH_4^+$ is a *weak* acid, the equilibrium lies far to the left. Only a small fraction of the $NH_4^+$ ions actually react to form $H_3O^+$. This small production of $H_3O^+$ is what makes the solution weakly acidic.\n\nThe crucial distinction is between the initial dissociation and the subsequent hydrolysis.\n- **Dissociation**: $NH_4Cl(s) \\rightarrow NH_4^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)$ (Complete, ~100%). This determines its classification as a strong electrolyte.\n- **Hydrolysis**: $NH_4^+(aq) + H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons NH_3(aq) + H_3O^+(aq)$ (Partial, 100%). This determines the pH of the solution.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. A strong electrolyte is defined by the complete dissociation of the solute into its constituent ions upon dissolving. The subsequent partial reaction of one of these ions with water (hydrolysis) does not alter this initial complete dissociation.**\nThis statement is correct. It precisely captures the distinction between the complete dissociation that defines a strong electrolyte and the separate, partial hydrolysis reaction that determines the solution's pH.\n\n**B. Since the ammonium ion ($NH_4^+$) is a weak acid, it only partially donates protons to water. This partial reaction is the defining characteristic of all weak electrolytes, but $NH_4Cl$ is an exception to this rule.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It confuses the behavior of the *ion* ($NH_4^+$ is part of a weak acid/base equilibrium) with the behavior of the *parent salt* ($NH_4Cl$). The classification as an electrolyte depends on the dissociation of the salt itself, not the subsequent acid-base behavior of its ions. Also, $NH_4Cl$ is not an \"exception\"; it follows the rule perfectly.\n\n**C. Strong electrolytes are highly soluble in water. Ammonium chloride is very soluble, which allows a large number of formula units to dissolve and conduct electricity, regardless of whether they dissociate.**\nThis is incorrect. While many strong electrolytes are highly soluble, solubility and electrolyte strength are distinct concepts. For example, acetic acid ($CH_3COOH$) is infinitely soluble in water, but it is a weak electrolyte because it only partially ionizes. Conversely, a substance could be sparingly soluble but be a strong electrolyte because the small amount that does dissolve dissociates completely (e.g., $AgCl$). Conduction requires mobile ions, which are produced by dissociation, not just dissolving.\n\n**D. The chloride ion ($Cl^-$) is the conjugate base of a strong acid and therefore does not react with water. The presence of this non-reactive, charge-carrying spectator ion is sufficient to classify the compound as a strong electrolyte.**\nThis statement is misleading. While it's true that $Cl^-$ is a spectator ion, its presence alone is not what defines the salt as a strong electrolyte. The defining feature is that *both* ions, $NH_4^+$ and $Cl^-$, are formed in a complete dissociation process. The non-reactivity of $Cl^-$ explains why the solution is acidic rather than neutral, but it doesn't explain the electrolyte strength.\n\n**E. The acidity of the solution is caused by the production of hydronium ions ($H_3O^+$). Any substance that increases the concentration of ions in solution is a strong electrolyte, and the generation of $H_3O^+$ fulfills this condition.**\nThis is incorrect. It conflates the cause and effect. The solution has a very high concentration of ions ($NH_4^+$ and $Cl^-$) from the complete dissociation. The generation of $H_3O^+$ via hydrolysis is a minor process that adds a very small number of additional ions compared to the initial dissociation. The \"strong electrolyte\" status is due to the large ion population from dissociation, not the small population from hydrolysis.\n\nTherefore, statement A provides the only accurate and complete explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1557979"}, {"introduction": "An electrolyte's defining feature is its ability to dissociate into multiple ions in solution, a process that directly impacts the physical properties of that solution. This exercise [@problem_id:1558000] provides a practical application of this concept by asking you to calculate the freezing point depression of a solution containing a complex salt.

The problem states that potassium hexacyanoferrate(II), $K_4[Fe(CN)_6]$, is a strong electrolyte and dissociates completely. The dissociation reaction in water is:\n$$\nK_4[Fe(CN)_6](s) \\rightarrow 4 K^+(aq) + [Fe(CN)_6]^{4-}(aq)\n$$\nThe hexacyanoferrate(II) ion, $[Fe(CN)_6]^{4-}$, is a stable coordination complex and does not dissociate further into iron and cyanide ions in the solution.

The total number of moles of ions produced per mole of solute is $4 + 1 = 5$. Thus, the ideal van't Hoff factor is $i=5$.\n\nNext, we calculate the molality ($m$) of the solution.

Electrical conductivity in a solution is directly related to the concentration, charge, and mobility of the dissolved ions.\n\n**1. Initial State (Before adding titrant)**\nThe initial solution contains barium chloride ($BaCl_2$), which is a strong electrolyte. It dissociates completely in water:\n$$BaCl_2(aq) \\rightarrow Ba^{2+}(aq) + 2Cl^{-}(aq)$$\nThe initial conductivity is due to the presence of mobile $Ba^{2+}$ and $Cl^{-}$ ions.\n\n**2. During Titration (Before the Equivalence Point)**\nThe titrant is an aqueous solution of sodium sulfate ($Na_2SO_4$), also a strong electrolyte, which provides $Na^{+}$ and $SO_4^{2-}$ ions. A precipitation reaction occurs between barium ions and sulfate ions:\n$$Ba^{2+}(aq) + SO_4^{2-}(aq) \\rightarrow BaSO_4(s)$$\nThe overall reaction in this stage is:\n$$BaCl_2(aq) + Na_2SO_4(aq) \\rightarrow BaSO_4(s) + 2NaCl(aq)$$\nLet's examine the change in the ionic species. For every mole of $Na_2SO_4$ added, one mole of $Ba^{2+}$ ions is removed from the solution as it precipitates. The added $SO_4^{2-}$ ions are also removed via this precipitation. However, two moles of $Na^{+}$ ions are added to the solution and remain dissolved, while the original $Cl^{-}$ ions act as spectator ions.\nEffectively, a single highly charged $Ba^{2+}$ ion is being replaced in the solution by two singly charged $Na^{+}$ ions.\n\nTo understand the impact on conductivity, we compare the contribution of the ions being replaced with those being added. The molar ionic conductivity ($\\lambda^\\circ$) is a measure of an ion's contribution to the overall conductivity. The relevant values are approximately:\n$\\lambda^\\circ(Ba^{2+})  \\lambda^\\circ(Na^{+})$.\nMore specifically, the contribution of an ion to conductivity is proportional to its concentration, charge, and mobility. A $Ba^{2+}$ ion has a charge of +2, while an $Na^{+}$ ion has a charge of +1. The molar ionic conductivity of $Ba^{2+}$ is significantly higher than that of $Na^{+}$. So, replacing one $Ba^{2+}$ ion with two $Na^{+}$ ions results in a net decrease in the solution's overall conductivity. Therefore, from the start of the addition until the equivalence point, the conductivity decreases.\n\n**3. At the Equivalence Point**\nThe equivalence point is reached when just enough $Na_2SO_4$ has been added to precipitate all the initial $Ba^{2+}$ ions as $BaSO_4(s)$. At this specific point, the concentration of the highly conductive $Ba^{2+}$ ions is at a minimum. The solution now primarily contains the dissolved salt formed during the reaction, sodium chloride ($NaCl$), which consists of $Na^{+}$ and $Cl^{-}$ ions. Since $NaCl$ is a soluble strong electrolyte, the solution still conducts electricity. However, because the high-mobility $Ba^{2+}$ ions have been removed, the overall conductivity reaches a minimum value at this point. This minimum is non-zero due to the presence of $Na^{+}$ and $Cl^{-}$ ions.\n\n**4. After the Equivalence Point**\nOnce all the $BaCl_2$ has reacted, any further addition of the $Na_2SO_4$ solution introduces excess $Na^{+}$ and $SO_4^{2-}$ ions into the solution. No further precipitation occurs. The concentration of mobile ions in the solution begins to increase, with both $Na^{+}$ and $SO_4^{2-}$ contributing to the charge transport. This leads to a steady increase in the overall electrical conductivity of the solution.\n\n**Conclusion**\nCombining these steps, the conductivity of the solution initially decreases as $Ba^{2+}$ ions are replaced by less conductive $Na^{+}$ ions. It reaches a non-zero minimum at the equivalence point when the concentration of $Ba^{2+}$ is negligible. After the equivalence point, the conductivity increases as excess electrolyte ($Na_2SO_4$) is added to the solution. This behavior corresponds to a decrease followed by an increase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1558025"}]}
