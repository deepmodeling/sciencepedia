For a concentrated 1:1 electrolyte salt bridge (like MCl), the junction potential is approximately proportional to the difference between the transference numbers of the cation ($t_+$) and the anion ($t_-$).\n$$E_j \\propto (t_+ - t_-)$$\nSince the sum of transference numbers for a binary electrolyte is unity, $t_+ + t_- = 1$, we can express $t_-$ as $1 - t_+$.
