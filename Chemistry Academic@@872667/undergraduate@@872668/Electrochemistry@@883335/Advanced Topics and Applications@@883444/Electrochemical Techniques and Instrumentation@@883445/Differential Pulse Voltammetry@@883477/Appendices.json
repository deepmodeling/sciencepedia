The double-layer capacitance at the electrode surface is increasing with each scan, leading to a smaller faradaic current response.", "solution": "The observation is a progressive decrease in the DPV peak current for paracetamol oxidation with the peak potential essentially unchanged across consecutive, rapid scans on the same uncleaned glassy carbon electrode.\n\nFirst, recall that in DPV the measured peak current is dominated by faradaic response with capacitive current largely canceled by the differential measurement. For a diffusion-controlled process during a pulse, the faradaic current obeys a Cottrell-type dependence:\n$$\ni_{f}(t)=n F A_{\\text{eff}} C \\frac{D^{1/2}}{\\pi^{1/2} t^{1/2}},\n$$\nso the extracted peak current scales as\n$$\ni_{p}\\propto n F A_{\\text{eff}} D^{1/2} C,\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of electrons, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $A_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective active electrode area, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $C$ is the bulk analyte concentration, and $t$ is the effective diffusion time at the pulse sampling. A progressive decrease in $i_{p}$ with a stable peak potential is therefore consistent with a reduction in $A_{\\text{eff}}$ while $C$ and the redox thermodynamics remain essentially unchanged.\n\nEvaluate each option against the observed behavior and governing relations:\n\n- Option A (bulk depletion): If bulk concentration were being significantly depleted, $C$ would decrease. The relevant fraction of analyte consumed per scan is $f=\\frac{Q}{n F C V}$, where $Q$ is the total charge passed in a scan and $V$ is the solution volume. For typical voltammetric scans in buffered solutions, $Q\\ll n F C V$, so $f\\ll 1$. Thus $C$ remains effectively constant, and bulk depletion cannot reasonably account for a pronounced, progressive decrease. Moreover, bulk depletion would also often be mitigated by diffusion on the inter-scan timescale in quick succession, further arguing against A.\n\n- Option B (reference drift): Drift of the Ag/AgCl potential would primarily shift the apparent peak potential $E_{p}$, not selectively diminish the peak current magnitude. The observation that the peak potential remains relatively stable contradicts this mechanism. Additionally, the current magnitude at a given overpotential is set by kinetics and mass transport, not by the absolute reference potential itself, so B is not consistent.\n\n- Option C (passivation/fouling): Strong adsorption or formation of insoluble oxidation products on glassy carbon reduces $A_{\\text{eff}}$ and/or slows heterogeneous electron transfer, lowering $i_{p}$ according to $i_{p}\\propto A_{\\text{eff}}$. Paracetamol oxidation is known to produce species (e.g., quinone-imine and related phenoxy radical-derived films) that can adsorb and foul carbon surfaces. This mechanism naturally produces a progressive decrease in peak current across consecutive scans while leaving the formal potential (and hence peak potential) relatively unchanged, matching the observations. Therefore C directly explains the data.\n\n- Option D (temperature increase and side reaction): An increase in temperature generally increases $D$ and rate constants via Stokes–Einstein and Arrhenius relations, which would tend to increase, not decrease, $i_{p}$ for the primary process. Invoking enhancement of a competing side reaction to consume analyte would require an additional assumption and would also likely alter peak shape or position. The short timescale of consecutive scans also makes significant temperature rise unlikely as the dominant cause. Hence D is not the most probable explanation.\n\n- Option E (increasing double-layer capacitance): The capacitive current obeys $i_{c}=C_{\\text{dl}}\\frac{dE}{dt}$, but DPV measures differential currents that largely cancel capacitive contributions at the sampling times. A change in $C_{\\text{dl}}$ would affect background but is not expected to produce a systematic decrease in the faradaic peak height across scans. Therefore E is not consistent with the observed specific diminution of faradaic peak current.\n\nGiven the dependence $i_{p}\\propto A_{\\text{eff}} C$ and the noted behavior for paracetamol on carbon electrodes, the most probable explanation is progressive passivation/fouling of the glassy carbon electrode surface by oxidation products, reducing $A_{\\text{eff}}$ and thus decreasing $i_{p}$ while leaving $E_{p}$ relatively stable.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1550160"}]}
