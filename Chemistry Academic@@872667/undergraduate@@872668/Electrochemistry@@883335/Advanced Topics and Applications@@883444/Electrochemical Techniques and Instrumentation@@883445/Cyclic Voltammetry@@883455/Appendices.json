One of the most common issues is the uncompensated resistance ($R_u$) of the electrolyte solution, which leads to an 'iR drop'.

Express your answer in millivolts (mV) and round it to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the observed peak separation in a Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiment where there is a significant uncompensated solution resistance, $R_u$.\n\nThe key principle is to understand how uncompensated resistance affects the potential measured and controlled by the potentiostat. The potential applied by the potentiostat, $E_{applied}$, is not the same as the potential experienced at the electrode-solution interface, $E_{interface}$, where the redox reaction occurs. The difference is the potential drop across the solution resistance, often called the iR drop, governed by Ohm's Law.\n\nThe relationship is given by:\n$$E_{applied} = E_{interface} + iR_u$$\nwhere $i$ is the current flowing through the cell and $R_u$ is the uncompensated resistance.\n\nThe voltammogram plots the current $i$ versus the applied potential $E_{applied}$. Therefore, the peak potentials we observe, $E_{pa,obs}$ (anodic) and $E_{pc,obs}$ (cathodic), are values of $E_{applied}$. The ideal peak potentials, $E_{pa,ideal}$ and $E_{pc,ideal}$, correspond to the potential at the interface.\n\nAt the anodic peak, the current is the anodic peak current, $i_{pa}$, and the observed potential is $E_{pa,obs}$. So, we have:\n$$E_{pa,obs} = E_{pa,ideal} + i_{pa}R_u$$\n\nSimilarly, at the cathodic peak, the current is the cathodic peak current, $i_{pc}$, and the observed potential is $E_{pc,obs}$:\n$$E_{pc,obs} = E_{pc,ideal} + i_{pc}R_u$$\n\nThe observed peak separation, $\\Delta E_{p,obs}$, is the difference between the observed anodic and cathodic peak potentials:\n$$\\Delta E_{p,obs} = E_{pa,obs} - E_{pc,obs}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the observed potentials:\n$$\\Delta E_{p,obs} = (E_{pa,ideal} + i_{pa}R_u) - (E_{pc,ideal} + i_{pc}R_u)$$\n\nRearranging the terms, we can separate the ideal component from the resistance-induced component:\n$$\\Delta E_{p,obs} = (E_{pa,ideal} - E_{pc,ideal}) + (i_{pa} - i_{pc})R_u$$\n\nThe first term, $(E_{pa,ideal} - E_{pc,ideal})$, is the ideal peak separation for a reversible system, which is given in the problem as $\\Delta E_{p,ideal} = 59.2$ mV.\n\nThe second term involves the peak currents. By convention, anodic current (oxidation) is positive, and cathodic current (reduction) is negative. The problem states that the magnitude of the peak current is $i_p = 75.0$ $\\mu$A. Therefore:\n$i_{pa} = i_p = 75.0$ $\\mu$A\n$i_{pc} = -i_p = -75.0$ $\\mu$A\n\nSubstituting these into the second term:\n$$(i_{pa} - i_{pc})R_u = (i_p - (-i_p))R_u = 2i_p R_u$$\n\nNow we can calculate the numerical value of this additional potential separation caused by the resistance. First, we must use consistent SI units.\n$i_p = 75.0$ $\\mu$A = $75.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ A\n$R_u = 225$ $\\Omega$\n\nThe additional separation is:\n$$2i_p R_u = 2 \\times (75.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ A}) \\times (225 \\text{ }\\Omega) = 0.03375 \\text{ V}$$\n\nTo add this to the ideal separation, we should convert it to millivolts (mV):\n$$0.03375 \\text{ V} = 33.75 \\text{ mV}$$\n\nNow, we can find the total observed peak separation:\n$$\\Delta E_{p,obs} = \\Delta E_{p,ideal} + 2i_p R_u$$\n$$\\Delta E_{p,obs} = 59.2 \\text{ mV} + 33.75 \\text{ mV} = 92.95 \\text{ mV}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe calculation of the resistive term $2i_p R_u$ involves values with three significant figures ($75.0$ $\\mu$A and $225$ $\\Omega$). The result $33.75$ mV should be rounded to three significant figures, which gives $33.8$ mV.\nThen, we perform the addition:\n$$\\Delta E_{p,obs} = 59.2 \\text{ mV} + 33.8 \\text{ mV} = 93.0 \\text{ mV}$$\nThe addition rule requires rounding to the last common decimal place, which is the tenths place, so the result is 93.0 mV.
