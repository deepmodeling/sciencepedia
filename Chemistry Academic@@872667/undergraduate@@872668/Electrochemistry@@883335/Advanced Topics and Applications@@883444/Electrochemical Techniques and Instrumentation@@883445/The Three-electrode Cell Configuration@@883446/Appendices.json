The experimental setup consists of a standard three-electrode cell connected to a potentiostat. The cell contains a Working Electrode (WE), a Reference Electrode (RE), and a Counter Electrode (CE), all immersed in the solution. The potentiostat is programmed to sweep the potential of the WE over a specific range and record the resulting current that flows through it.\n\nUpon running the experiment, the student observes that the output on the screen, which plots current versus potential, is a perfectly flat horizontal line at exactly zero current for the entire duration of the potential sweep.

The measured current is the WE current, which necessarily flows through the external circuit WE–potentiostat–CE and returns through the solution. Thus, a nonzero current requires a closed current path between WE and CE.\n\nA perfectly flat line at exactly zero current over the entire sweep indicates an open circuit in the current-carrying path. In circuit terms, if the effective resistance between WE and CE is $R \\to \\infty$, then by Ohm’s law,\n$$\nI = \\frac{\\Delta E}{R} \\to 0\n$$\nfor any finite applied potential difference $\\Delta E$. Therefore, an open CE connection (broken or disconnected counter electrode lead) yields identically zero current.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\n- A. Swapping WE and CE: The current path WE–solution–CE remains intact, so current can still flow. The voltammogram may be distorted or inverted, but not identically zero. Hence not consistent with a flat zero line.\n\n- B. Broken or disconnected RE: The feedback loop that controls WE potential is lost. The control amplifier typically drives to compliance, often producing large or erratic currents rather than exactly zero. Not consistent with a flat zero line.\n\n- C. Broken or disconnected CE: The current path is open, so $R_{\\text{WE-CE}} \\to \\infty$ and\n$$\nI = \\frac{\\Delta E}{R_{\\text{WE-CE}}} = 0,\n$$\ngiving a perfectly flat zero current trace.

This produces a nonzero background current (rectangular baseline), not exactly zero. Moreover, the problem states the solution was prepared properly.\n\n- E. Swapping RE and CE: The instrument attempts to reference to a low-impedance CE and drive current through the high-impedance RE. The RE typically has large internal resistance $R_{\\text{RE}}$, so current would be severely limited, but not strictly zero unless the path is effectively open. The control loop also fails, often triggering errors or odd signals rather than a perfect zero line.

This practice problem explores the severe consequences of swapping the connections for the reference and counter electrodes [@problem_id:1599476]. Analyzing this failure mode illuminates the crucial design principle of the reference electrode: it is a high-impedance sensor that must remain at equilibrium, a condition that is violated the moment it is forced to carry significant current.", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is setting up a three-electrode electrochemical cell to perform a Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiment.

The researcher connects these electrodes to a potentiostat, an electronic instrument that controls the potential difference between the WE and RE while measuring the current flowing between the WE and CE.\n\nDuring the setup, the student makes a critical error: they accidentally swap the electrical leads connecting the potentiostat to the Reference Electrode and the Counter Electrode. That is, the potentiostat's \"Reference\" lead is connected to the platinum wire CE, and its \"Counter\" lead is connected to the Ag/AgCl RE. The connection to the Working Electrode is correct. The student then initiates the CV scan, programming the potentiostat to sweep the potential of the WE.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the primary and most immediate consequences of this misconfiguration for the experiment?\n\nA. The potential of the working electrode will be accurately controlled relative to the counter electrode, but the recorded current will be meaningless because it is not being measured at a stable reference potential.\n\nB.

The control loop now enforces\n$$\n\\phi_{\\text{WE}} - \\phi_{\\text{Pt}} = E_{\\text{set}}\n$$\nwhile driving current between WE and the Ag/AgCl electrode. Consequently:\n- The Ag/AgCl electrode is now in the current-carrying path, so $I_{\\text{Ag/AgCl}} = -I_{\\text{WE}} \\neq 0$. This forces Faradaic reactions at the Ag/AgCl electrode, producing a kinetic overpotential $\\eta$ and composition changes. Its potential becomes\n$$\nE_{\\text{Ag/AgCl}} = E^{\\circ}_{\\text{Ag/AgCl}} + \\eta + \\Delta \\phi,\n$$\nwith $\\eta \\neq 0$ when $I \\neq 0$, and with additional drift due to changes in the Ag/AgCl interface (e.g., $\\text{AgCl}(s) + e^{-} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Ag}(s) + \\text{Cl}^{-}$), risking irreversible alteration of the reference element. This defeats the defining requirement that a reference electrode carry negligible current.\n- The platinum “reference” is not a true reference.

Due to a poorly designed cell geometry, the bulky insulating sheath of the reference electrode is positioned directly in front of the center of the planar working electrode's active surface.

The voltammogram will appear distorted, characterized by a significant increase in the separation between the anodic and cathodic peak potentials and a reduction in the peak currents.\n\nB. The placement of the reference electrode will cause its potential to drift, resulting in a continuous, sloping baseline shift in the voltammogram without affecting the peak shapes.\n\nC.

The voltammogram will show perfectly symmetrical and sharp peaks for the redox couple, but the entire curve will be shifted along the potential axis to either a more positive or more negative value.\n\nE. The shielding will primarily block mass transport of the analyte to the electrode surface, leading to significantly smaller but well-shaped, essentially reversible peaks with the standard peak separation.", "solution": "For a one-electron, reversible redox couple in an ideal cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement at a planar working electrode (WE), the standard signatures are:\n- The anodic and cathodic peak potentials are separated by the reversible value $\\Delta E_{p}^{\\text{rev}} \\propto \\frac{R T}{n F}$, independent of scan rate for a diffusion-controlled, Nernstian system.\n- The peak current magnitudes follow the Randles–Sevcik proportionality\n$$\ni_{p}^{\\text{ideal}} = k_{\\text{RS}}\\, n^{\\frac{3}{2}} F A C \\sqrt{\\frac{D v}{R T}},\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{RS}}$ is a constant factor from the exact solution, $n$ is the number of electrons, $A$ is the geometric electrode area, $C$ is the bulk concentration, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $v$ is the scan rate, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\nIn a real cell, the potentiostat controls the potential between WE and reference electrode (RE). The interfacial potential at the WE is reduced by the uncompensated solution resistance $R_{u}$ between the WE surface and the point where the RE senses the potential.

Ionic current flows along field lines between CE and WE through the electrolyte with conductivity $\\kappa$. A local obstruction increases the effective path length and reduces the effective cross-sectional area for current entering the central region, which increases the local resistance. In a homogeneous medium, a representative segment contributes $dR = \\frac{dl}{\\kappa A_{\\perp}}$; the sheath raises the integral $R_{u} = \\int dR$ for current reaching the central WE. As a result:\n- The uncompensated resistance $R_{u}$ increases, so the ohmic drop $i R_{u}$ becomes significant. Because $i$ changes sign between forward and reverse scans, the peaks are displaced in opposite directions. To leading order, the observed peak separation increases approximately as\n$$\n\\Delta E_{p,\\text{obs}} \\approx \\Delta E_{p}^{\\text{rev}} + 2\\, i_{p}\\, R_{u},\n$$\nso the voltammogram exhibits a larger separation between anodic and cathodic peaks than the reversible value.\n- The obstruction also redistributes current density $j(\\boldsymbol{r})$ toward the unobstructed periphery. The central region carries less current due to the elevated local resistance.
