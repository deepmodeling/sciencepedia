Therefore, effective preparation proceeds from a coarser abrasive to a finer one to achieve a mirror-like finish efficiently. Starting with a fine abrasive cannot efficiently remove deeper defects from prior use, and reversing the order (fine then coarse) would reintroduce scratches.\n\nTo avoid cross-contamination, it is important to remove residual coarse particles before switching to a finer abrasive; otherwise, larger particles carried over into the fine step will continue to create deep scratches and prevent achieving a mirror finish. A thorough rinse between abrasives is the minimal effective measure given the available resources.\n\nAfter polishing, residual alumina particles can remain embedded in or adhered to the surface and in pores. Sonication in deionized water is used to dislodge and remove these particles through cavitation, ensuring a clean surface essential for reproducible electrochemical measurements.

The standard procedure involves using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) to characterize the behavior of a 1.0 mM solution of a well-known redox probe, which undergoes a reversible, one-electron transfer reaction. The solution also contains a 0.1 M supporting electrolyte, and the experiment is conducted at a standard temperature of 298 K.\n\nThe student first performs a CV scan using Electrode A, which has been meticulously polished with progressively finer alumina slurries and sonicated, representing an ideal, clean electrode surface. The resulting voltammogram is consistent with theoretical expectations for a Nernstian (fully reversible) system.\n\nNext, the student tests Electrode B. This electrode was only coarsely polished and was not properly cleaned, leaving behind microscopic scratches and a thin, partially passivating layer of adsorbed impurities on its surface.

The peak currents, $|i_{pa}|$ and $|i_{pc}|$, will be substantially lower for Electrode B, but the peak-to-peak potential separation, $\\Delta E_p$, will be identical to that of Electrode A. This is because the passivation layer only reduces the active surface area.", "solution": "We analyze the expected change in a cyclic voltammogram when moving from an ideally clean, reversible glassy carbon electrode (Electrode A) to a poorly prepared, partially passivated one (Electrode B), for a one-electron, Nernstian redox probe in excess supporting electrolyte at temperature $T$.\n\nFor a fully reversible system at a macroscopic planar electrode, the surface concentrations obey the Nernst boundary condition at all times,\n$$\nE(t)=E^{0'}+\\frac{RT}{nF}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{O}}(0,t)}{C_{\\mathrm{R}}(0,t)}\\right),\n$$\nand semi-infinite linear diffusion controls mass transport.

A standard result (Nicholson–Shain analysis) is that the dimensionless kinetic parameter\n$$\n\\psi \\propto \\frac{k^{0}}{\\left(\\frac{nFvD}{RT}\\right)^{1/2}}\n$$\ncontrols the voltammetric response.

Physically, slower electron transfer requires a larger overpotential to sustain the same current, which spreads the anodic and cathodic peak potentials farther apart. Simultaneously, the peak currents are generally reduced relative to the reversible Randles–Sevcik prediction, both because of kinetic limitations and any reduction in $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ due to passivation.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because catalysis (if present) would increase $k^{0}$ and cannot reduce $\\Delta E_{p}$ below the reversible limit. The reversible limit is already the minimal separation for a diffusion-controlled macroscopic electrode; approaching $0$ is not attainable for this system.\n- Option B is correct: a poorly prepared, partially passivated surface lowers $k^{0}$, making the system quasi-reversible, so $\\Delta E_{p}$ becomes significantly larger than that for Electrode A.\n- Option C is incorrect because $E^{0'}$ is a thermodynamic parameter of the redox couple and medium; surface contamination affecting kinetics does not selectively shift $E^{0'}$ while leaving $\\Delta E_{p}$ unchanged. Apparent peak shifts arise from kinetic overpotentials, which also increase $\\Delta E_{p}$.\n- Option D is incomplete/incorrect: while blocking the surface can lower $|i_{pa}|$ and $|i_{pc}|$ via a reduced $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the stated passivation and poor polishing also slow electron transfer (smaller $k^{0}$), so the system will not remain perfectly reversible; hence $\\Delta E_{p}$ will not remain identical to the reversible value.\n\nTherefore, the key expected difference is an increased peak-to-peak separation due to slower electron transfer kinetics at Electrode B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1555423"}, {"introduction": "The \"area\" of an electrode is not a single value; it depends on what you are measuring and the length scale you are probing. This final practice explores the subtle but important distinction between the macroscopic geometric area and the microscopic true surface area. You will learn to quantitatively determine an electrode's roughness factor by reconciling the seemingly contradictory observations of its Faradaic (diffusion-controlled) and non-Faradaic (capacitive) currents, highlighting how these signals interact differently with surface morphology [@problem_id:1555422].", "problem": "An electrochemistry student is investigating the effect of surface preparation on the behavior of a Glassy Carbon Electrode (GCE). Two GCEs, labeled A and B, both with a nominal diameter of 3.00 mm, are used in an experiment. Electrode A has been meticulously polished with progressively finer alumina slurries down to 0.05 microns, resulting in a mirror-like surface. Electrode B has only been crudely polished with a 1.0-micron slurry, leaving its surface visibly dull.\n\nBoth electrodes are tested using cyclic voltammetry in an aqueous solution containing a reversible, one-electron redox couple. The following observations are made:\n\n1.  For the diffusion-controlled Faradaic process, the measured anodic peak currents, $i_{p,A}$ and $i_{p,B}$, are found to be essentially identical. You may assume $i_{p,A} = i_{p,B}$. The peak current for such a process is governed by the Randles-Sevcik equation: $i_p = k \\cdot A_{eff}$, where $k$ is a constant incorporating concentration, scan rate, and diffusion coefficient, and $A_{eff}$ is the effective area for diffusion.\n\n2.  In a potential region where no Faradaic reaction occurs, the non-Faradaic charging current, $i_c$, is measured. This current is directly proportional to the double-layer capacitance, $C_{dl}$, and the scan rate, $v$, according to $i_c = v \\cdot C_{dl}$. The double-layer capacitance is itself directly proportional to the true, microscopic Electrochemically Active Surface Area (ECSA), given by $C_{dl} = c_{dl} \\cdot A_{ECSA}$, where $c_{dl}$ is the specific double-layer capacitance per unit area. The student observes that the charging current for Electrode B is 30.0% larger than that for Electrode A, i.e., $i_{c,B} = 1.300 \\cdot i_{c,A}$.\n\nThe roughness factor, $R_f$, of an electrode is defined as the ratio of its Electrochemically Active Surface Area to its projected geometric area ($R_f = A_{ECSA} / A_{proj}$).

Express your answer as a number rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the roughness factor of Electrode B by relating the two distinct electrochemical measurements (Faradaic peak current and non-Faradaic charging current) to different aspects of the electrode's surface area.\n\nLet's begin by analyzing the information provided for the Faradaic peak current, $i_p$. The problem states that this process is diffusion-controlled. For diffusion-controlled processes, the reactants are supplied from a diffusion layer that is typically micrometers thick. This layer is much larger than the microscopic features of a rough surface. As a result, the diffusion field effectively \"sees\" a planar surface, and the relevant area, $A_{eff}$, in the Randles-Sevcik equation ($i_p = k \\cdot A_{eff}$) is the macroscopic, projected geometric area, $A_{proj}$. The projected geometric area is the same for both electrodes since they have the same nominal diameter.\n\nLet $A_{proj,A}$ and $A_{proj,B}$ be the projected geometric areas of electrodes A and B, respectively. Since their diameters are identical, $A_{proj,A} = A_{proj,B}$. Let's denote this common area by $A_{proj}$.\n\nThe peak currents are given by:\n$$i_{p,A} = k \\cdot A_{proj,A}$$\n$$i_{p,B} = k \\cdot A_{proj,B}$$\nThe problem states that $i_{p,A} = i_{p,B}$, which is consistent with the fact that $A_{proj,A} = A_{proj,B}$. This observation confirms that the effective area for the diffusion-limited current is the projected geometric area.\n\nNext, we analyze the non-Faradaic charging current, $i_c$. This current arises from the charging and discharging of the electrical double layer at the electrode-solution interface. This phenomenon occurs right at the surface, on a molecular scale. Therefore, the capacitance, and thus the charging current, is proportional to the true, microscopic surface area, which is the Electrochemically Active Surface Area ($A_{ECSA}$).\n\nThe charging current is given by $i_c = v \\cdot C_{dl}$, and the capacitance is $C_{dl} = c_{dl} \\cdot A_{ECSA}$. Combining these gives:\n$$i_c = v \\cdot c_{dl} \\cdot A_{ECSA}$$\nFor electrodes A and B, the scan rate $v$ and the specific capacitance $c_{dl}$ (an intrinsic property of the GCE/solution interface) are the same. Thus, we have:\n$$i_{c,A} = v \\cdot c_{dl} \\cdot A_{ECSA,A}$$\n$$i_{c,B} = v \\cdot c_{dl} \\cdot A_{ECSA,B}$$\nThe problem states that $i_{c,B} = 1.300 \\cdot i_{c,A}$. Substituting the expressions above:\n$$v \\cdot c_{dl} \\cdot A_{ECSA,B} = 1.300 \\cdot (v \\cdot c_{dl} \\cdot A_{ECSA,A})$$\nThe terms $v$ and $c_{dl}$ cancel out, leaving a direct relationship between the true surface areas:\n$$A_{ECSA,B} = 1.300 \\cdot A_{ECSA,A}$$\nThis shows that the true surface area of the rough Electrode B is 30.0% larger than that of the smooth Electrode A.\n\nNow we can calculate the roughness factor, $R_f = A_{ECSA} / A_{proj}$.\nFor Electrode A, we are given that it is ideally smooth with $R_{f,A} = 1.000$.\n$$R_{f,A} = \\frac{A_{ECSA,A}}{A_{proj,A}} = 1.000$$\nThis implies that for the smooth electrode, its true surface area is equal to its projected geometric area: $A_{ECSA,A} = A_{proj,A} = A_{proj}$.\n\nFor Electrode B, the roughness factor is:\n$$R_{f,B} = \\frac{A_{ECSA,B}}{A_{proj,B}}$$\nWe know that $A_{proj,B} = A_{proj,A} = A_{proj}$. We also found that $A_{ECSA,B} = 1.300 \\cdot A_{ECSA,A}$. We can substitute $A_{ECSA,A} = A_{proj}$ into this relationship:\n$$A_{ECSA,B} = 1.300 \\cdot A_{proj}$$\nNow, we can substitute these into the expression for $R_{f,B}$:\n$$R_{f,B} = \\frac{1.300 \\cdot A_{proj}}{A_{proj}}$$\nThe term $A_{proj}$ cancels out:\n$$R_{f,B} = 1.300$$\nThe roughness factor of Electrode B is 1.300.
