The student is using an Ultramicroelectrode (UME), which is defined as an electrode with at least one characteristic dimension on the micrometer scale. Based on their lecture notes, the student expects to observe a sigmoidal (S-shaped) current-potential curve, which is characteristic of the steady-state mass transport to a UME. However, the resulting voltammogram displays a distinct peak-shaped response, similar to what would be expected from a conventional, larger macroelectrode. Assuming the UME itself is not faulty and the electrochemical cell is set up correctly, which of the following experimental choices is the most plausible reason for observing a peak-shaped voltammogram instead of the expected sigmoidal one?\n\nA. The concentration of the supporting electrolyte was too low.\n\nB. The potential scan rate was too fast.\n\nC. The potential scan rate was too slow.\n\nD.

This requires that, over the timescale of the potential sweep, the diffusion layer thickness exceeds the electrode’s characteristic radius.\n\n1) Characteristic timescale of the CV wave:\nFor a reversible redox couple, the current rises significantly over a characteristic potential span on the order of $\\frac{R T}{n F}$. For a scan rate $v$ (potential per unit time), the corresponding timescale is\n$$\nt \\sim \\frac{R T}{n F v}.\n$$\n\n2) Diffusion length over this timescale:\nDiffusion develops a characteristic thickness\n$$\nL \\sim \\sqrt{D t} \\sim \\sqrt{D \\,\\frac{R T}{n F v}}.\n$$\n\n3) Condition for steady-state (hemispherical) diffusion at a UME:\nLet $a$ be the characteristic radius of the UME (for a disk, the electrode radius). Steady-state hemispherical diffusion, and thus a sigmoidal CV, requires\n$$\nL \\gtrsim a \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\sqrt{D \\,\\frac{R T}{n F v}} \\gtrsim a.\n$$\nEquivalently,\n$$\nv \\lesssim \\frac{D R T}{n F a^{2}}.\n$$\nIf instead\n$$\nv \\gg \\frac{D R T}{n F a^{2}},\n$$\nthen $L \\ll a$, diffusion remains effectively planar and transient during the sweep, and the CV response becomes peak-shaped, as for a macroelectrode.\n\n4) Current scaling highlights the contrast:\n- UME steady-state limiting current (disk geometry) is independent of $v$ and scales as\n$$\ni_{\\text{ss}} \\sim n F D C \\, a\n$$\n(up to a geometry factor of order unity), producing a sigmoidal wave with a plateau.\n- Planar transient (macro-like) reversible CV peak current scales as\n$$\ni_{p} \\sim n F A C \\,\\sqrt{\\frac{n F D v}{R T}},\n$$\nwhich increases with $\\sqrt{v}$ and yields a peak-shaped response rather than a plateau.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A (supporting electrolyte too low): Insufficient supporting electrolyte enhances migration and can distort waves or increase limiting currents, but does not inherently transform a UME’s steady-state sigmoidal response into a clean macroelectrode-like peak under otherwise proper conditions.\n- B (scan rate too fast): As shown above, large $v$ ensures $L \\ll a$, preventing steady-state; the CV becomes peak-shaped. This directly explains the observation.\n- C (scan rate too slow): This promotes, rather than suppresses, steady-state behavior; it would favor a sigmoidal curve.\n- D (ferrocene concentration too high): Increases current magnitude but does not by itself change a steady-state sigmoidal shape into a peak.\n- E (solution not deoxygenated): Dissolved oxygen introduces additional redox features, typically at different potentials, but does not systematically convert a steady-state UME wave into a macro-like peak for ferrocene oxidation.\n\nConclusion: The most plausible cause is an excessively fast scan rate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1486566"}, {"introduction": "While many electrochemical models assume a quiescent solution, numerous applications, such as in-line process monitoring and microfluidic devices, involve flowing electrolytes.
