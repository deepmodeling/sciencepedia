This technique, a form of cathodic protection, causes the attached metal to act as a sacrificial anode, corroding in place of the steel. Consider a scenario where a large block of zinc (Zn) is attached to the hull of a ship.

A galvanic cell is a spontaneous electrochemical cell, which means the overall cell potential must be positive. The standard cell potential is calculated using the standard reduction potentials of the two half-cells involved.\n\nFirst, we must identify which metal serves as the anode (where oxidation occurs) and which serves as the cathode (where reduction occurs). In a galvanic cell, the half-reaction with the more negative (or less positive) standard reduction potential will proceed as an oxidation. This electrode is the anode. The half-reaction with the less negative (or more positive) standard reduction potential will proceed as a reduction.
