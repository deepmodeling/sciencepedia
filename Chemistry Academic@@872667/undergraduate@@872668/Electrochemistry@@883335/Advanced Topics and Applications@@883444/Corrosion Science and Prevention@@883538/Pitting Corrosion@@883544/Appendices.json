[@problem_id:1579231]", "problem": "A materials engineering team is tasked with selecting an optimal alloy for constructing storage tanks that will contain a warm, aerated saline solution. This environment is known to be aggressive and can induce localized pitting corrosion in many metals. For a metal to be suitable, it must maintain a protective passive film on its surface under normal operating conditions. The failure of this film and the onset of pitting occurs if the metal's electrochemical potential rises above a critical value known as the pitting potential ($E_{pit}$). Under normal, freely corroding conditions, the metal will rest at its corrosion potential ($E_{corr}$).\n\nThe team has collected the following electrochemical data for five candidate alloys, measured in the target saline solution.

Alloy A\n\nB. Alloy B\n\nC. Alloy C\n\nD. Alloy D\n\nE. Alloy E", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the alloy with the best resistance to pitting corrosion. This resistance is determined by the stability of the passive film on the metal's surface when exposed to the corrosive environment.\n\nFirst, let's define the key parameters provided:\n1.  **Corrosion Potential ($E_{corr}$):** This is the natural, open-circuit potential a metal exhibits when immersed in a specific electrolyte. It is the potential at which the rate of the anodic (metal dissolution) and cathodic (e.g., oxygen reduction) reactions are equal. In the absence of external electrical influences, the tank material will be at this potential.\n2.  **Pitting Potential ($E_{pit}$):** This is the critical potential above which the protective passive film breaks down locally, leading to the formation and propagation of stable pits. For the material to be protected, its potential must remain below $E_{pit}$.\n\nPitting corrosion will not initiate as long as the metal's potential is less than its pitting potential. In this scenario, the metal's potential is its corrosion potential, $E_{corr}$. Therefore, a fundamental requirement for pitting resistance is that $E_{corr} < E_{pit}$. If $E_{corr} \\geq E_{pit}$, the material will start pitting immediately upon immersion without any external influence, making it completely unsuitable.\n\nLet's check this condition for all alloys:\n*   Alloy A: $E_{corr} = -0.45 \\text{ V} < E_{pit} = -0.15 \\text{ V}$. Condition met.\n*   Alloy B: $E_{corr} = -0.70 \\text{ V} < E_{pit} = -0.62 \\text{ V}$. Condition met.\n*   Alloy C: $E_{corr} = -0.30 \\text{ V} < E_{pit} = +0.25 \\text{ V}$. Condition met.\n*   Alloy D: $E_{corr} = +0.05 \\text{ V} < E_{pit} = +0.12 \\text{ V}$. Condition met.\n*   Alloy E: $E_{corr} = -0.20 \\text{ V} > E_{pit} = -0.25 \\text{ V}$. Condition is NOT met. Alloy E is unsuitable as it will pit spontaneously.\n\nThe \"operational safety margin\" against pitting corrosion is the potential difference between the pitting potential and the corrosion potential, $\\Delta E = E_{pit} - E_{corr}$. This quantity represents the \"passivity window\" — the range of potential the material can withstand above its normal resting potential before pitting begins. Unforeseen operational factors, such as an increase in temperature, a change in solution aeration, or stray electrical fields, can cause the material's potential to shift in the positive (anodic) direction from $E_{corr}$. A larger $\\Delta E$ provides a greater buffer against these fluctuations, making the material more reliable and resistant to the initiation of pitting.\n\nNow, we calculate $\\Delta E$ for the suitable alloys (A, B, C, and D):\n\nFor Alloy A:\n$\\Delta E_A = E_{pit} - E_{corr} = (-0.15 \\text{ V}) - (-0.45 \\text{ V}) = 0.30 \\text{ V}$\n\nFor Alloy B:\n$\\Delta E_B = E_{pit} - E_{corr} = (-0.62 \\text{ V}) - (-0.70 \\text{ V}) = 0.08 \\text{ V}$\n\nFor Alloy C:\n$\\Delta E_C = E_{pit} - E_{corr} = (+0.25 \\text{ V}) - (-0.30 \\text{ V}) = 0.55 \\text{ V}$\n\nFor Alloy D:\n$\\Delta E_D = E_{pit} - E_{corr} = (+0.12 \\text{ V}) - (+0.05 \\text{ V}) = 0.07 \\text{ V}$\n\nComparing the calculated safety margins:\n*   $\\Delta E_A = 0.30$ V\n*   $\\Delta E_B = 0.08$ V\n*   $\\Delta E_C = 0.55$ V\n*   $\\Delta E_D = 0.07$ V\n\nAlloy C has the largest value of $\\Delta E$ (0.55 V). This indicates it has the widest passive range and can tolerate the largest positive shift in potential before pitting initiates. While Alloy D has a more noble (positive) corrosion potential, its safety margin is extremely small (0.07 V), making it very susceptible to pitting if conditions change even slightly.
