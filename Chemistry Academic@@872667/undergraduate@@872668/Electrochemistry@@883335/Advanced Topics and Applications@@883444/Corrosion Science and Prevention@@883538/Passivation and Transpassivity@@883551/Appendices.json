We must analyze the interaction between the material (stainless steel with its passive layer) and the environment (hot, concentrated $\\text{HCl}$).\n\nFirst, let's understand the protective mechanism of stainless steel. It relies on a passive film, primarily $\\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_3$, which spontaneously forms in oxidizing environments. This film acts as a barrier, preventing the underlying metal from reacting with the environment. For the steel to be corrosion-resistant, this film must remain stable and inert.\n\nNext, let's analyze the chemical environment: hot, concentrated hydrochloric acid. This environment has three key aggressive features:\n1.  **High $H^+$ concentration (low pH)**: This creates a highly acidic and reducing environment. The dominant cathodic reaction is the reduction of hydrogen ions to hydrogen gas: $2H^+ + 2e^- \\rightarrow H_2(g)$. This reaction consumes electrons, thereby driving the anodic reaction, which is the dissolution (oxidation) of the metal, for instance, $Fe \\rightarrow Fe^{2+} + 2e^-$ or $Cr \\rightarrow Cr^{3+} + 3e^-$. The electrode potential in such an environment is typically low, falling into the \"active\" region for metals like iron and chromium, where their oxides are not thermodynamically stable. The oxide layer ($\\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_3$) can be directly dissolved by the acid: $\\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_3 + 6H^+ \\rightarrow 2\\text{Cr}^{3+} + 3\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$.\n2.  **High $Cl^-$ concentration**: Chloride ions are particularly aggressive towards passive films. They are small and can penetrate the oxide layer at microscopic defects or grain boundaries. Once at the metal-oxide interface, they participate in the anodic dissolution reaction by forming highly soluble metal-chloride complexes (e.g., $[\\text{FeCl}_4]^{2-}$, $[\\text{Cr(H}_2\\text{O)}_4\\text{Cl}_2]^+$). This complexation prevents the metal cations from reacting with water to form an insoluble oxide or hydroxide to repair the film (a process called repassivation). This leads to a localized, accelerating form of corrosion known as pitting corrosion.\n3.  **High Temperature**: Elevated temperatures increase the rates of all chemical reactions and diffusion processes. This includes the rate of the cathodic reaction (hydrogen evolution), the anodic reaction (metal dissolution), and the diffusion of ions like $Cl^-$ to the surface. Therefore, the overall corrosion rate is significantly accelerated at high temperatures.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on this understanding:\n\n**A. The high concentration of hydrogen ions ($H^+$) will cathodically protect the steel by forming a dense layer of hydrogen gas on its surface, which passivates the metal.**\nThis is incorrect. The reduction of $H^+$ to $H_2$ is the cathodic half-reaction that *drives* the anodic dissolution (corrosion) of the metal. It is the opposite of protection. While a layer of hydrogen bubbles can physically block parts of the surface, this is not a form of electrochemical \"cathodic protection\" and does not lead to passivation.\n\n**B. The conditions will cause transpassivation of the chromium, leading to the formation of soluble hexavalent chromium species (e.g., $\\text{CrO}_4^{2-}$), which rapidly dissolves the protective layer.**\nThis is incorrect. Transpassivation is a phenomenon that occurs at very high anodic potentials, corresponding to strongly oxidizing conditions. In this state, the $Cr(III)$ in the stable $\\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_3$ layer is oxidized to a higher, soluble oxidation state like $Cr(VI)$ in chromate ($\\text{CrO}_4^{2-}$). Hydrochloric acid is a *reducing* acid; the electrochemical potential is low, not high. Therefore, transpassivation does not occur.\n\n**C. The passive layer of chromium oxide is thermodynamically unstable in the low-potential, reducing environment of the acid. This instability is exacerbated by chloride ions, which locally break down the film and form soluble metal-chloride complexes, preventing repassivation.**\nThis is the correct explanation. It accurately identifies the two critical failure mechanisms working in synergy. First, the reducing nature of the acid makes the oxide film thermodynamically unstable (\"active corrosion\"). Second, the chloride ions specifically attack the film and prevent it from healing by forming soluble complexes, leading to severe pitting. This statement correctly covers the essential electrochemistry of the failure.\n\n**D. The high nickel content of the alloy makes it highly susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement when exposed to acids, leading to rapid mechanical fracture as the primary failure mode.**\nThis is plausible but not the best explanation. While hydrogen embrittlement can occur in stainless steels in hydrogen-generating environments, the primary and most immediate failure mode in hot, concentrated $\\text{HCl}$ is extremely rapid and severe electrochemical corrosion (both general and pitting). The material would likely dissolve and lose its structural integrity due to mass loss long before delayed fracture from hydrogen embrittlement becomes the main concern. It is a secondary effect, not the primary reason for its unsuitability.\n\n**E. The iron within the alloy reacts with the acid to form a stable and insoluble iron(II) chloride layer, which is brittle and flakes off, exposing fresh metal underneath.**\nThis is incorrect. Iron(II) chloride ($\\text{FeCl}_2$) and iron(III) chloride ($\\text{FeCl}_3$) are both highly soluble in water and aqueous acid solutions. They do not form a stable, protective, or insoluble layer. The formation of these soluble salts is precisely what carries the metal away from the surface into the solution, thus constituting corrosion.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the most complete and accurate description of the electrochemical processes that make stainless steel unsuitable for this application.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1578244"}]}
