For fixed local alkalinity near the cathode, a decrease in $a_{\\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ increases the logarithmic term and therefore decreases $E_{\\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, shifting the local mixed potential in the negative direction. Thus, inside the crevice (Region 1) where $a_{\\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is low, the local cathodic oxygen reduction is suppressed and the equilibrium potential is lower (more active), predisposing this area to act as the anode relative to the well-aerated Region 2.\n\nBy mixed potential theory and galvanic coupling through the continuous steel, the region with lower oxygen access (Region 1) cannot sustain the necessary cathodic current density; it therefore supplies anodic current via iron dissolution. Electrons produced in Region 1 flow through the metal to Region 2, where oxygen reduction proceeds due to the higher $a_{\\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. The electrolyte (seawater) closes the circuit via ionic current.

This self-sustaining chemistry confirms that Region 1 is the anode and Region 2 is the cathode.\n\nThe polymer strip is inert and non-conductive, so it does not participate as an electrode. Corrosion is not uniformly distributed (contradicting uniform attack), nor is it confined only to the precise boundary; rather, it localizes within and just inside the crevice, driven by the differential aeration.

To counteract this acidification and halt the corrosion, the pH of the bulk solution (the large volume outside the crevice) is adjusted and maintained at a constant value of 10.0. This creates a concentration gradient that drives hydroxide ions ($OH^-$) from the bulk solution into the acidic crevice.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of this neutralization strategy, calculate the dimensionless stability ratio, $\\mathcal{R}$.
