Corrosion, which drives crack growth, is characterized by a high current density, $i_{bare}$, on the bare metal surface and a much lower current density, $i_{pass}$, on the fully passivated surface.\n\nTo evaluate the material, two tests are performed in the corrosive environment:\n\n1.  **Static Constant-Load Test**: A sample with a pre-existing surface crack is loaded to a stress intensity factor just above the alloy's intrinsic threshold for SCC. Due to the alloy's high ductility, crack-tip blunting occurs, and any further local strain is caused solely by material creep.

This practice puts you in the role of a materials engineer tasked with making such a decision based on standard electrochemical data. By analyzing key features of potentiodynamic polarization curves, such as the pitting potential ($E_{pitt}$) and passive current density ($i_{pass}$), you will learn to evaluate and compare the SCC resistance of different alloys and justify your choice for a critical application [@problem_id:1590734].", "problem": "A materials engineer is selecting an alloy for a heat exchanger tube in a new geothermal power plant. The tube will be under a constant tensile stress and exposed to a hot, deaerated, high-chloride brine solution. The primary failure concern under these conditions is Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC).\n\nTo evaluate their corrosion behavior, potentiodynamic polarization scans were performed on two candidate nickel-based superalloys, Alloy A and Alloy B, in a simulated brine environment at the operating temperature. The key features of the anodic polarization curves are summarized below. All potentials are reported with respect to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE).\n\n**Alloy A:**\n- Exhibits a corrosion potential ($E_{corr}$) of -0.250 V.\n- Shows an active-to-passive transition, achieving passivity.\n- In the passive region, it maintains a stable, low passive current density ($i_{pass}$) of $1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ A/m².\n- Localized corrosion initiates abruptly at a pitting potential ($E_{pitt}$) of +0.320 V.\n\n**Alloy B:**\n- Exhibits a corrosion potential ($E_{corr}$) of -0.150 V.\n- Directly passivates upon anodic polarization from its corrosion potential.\n- In the passive region, it shows a passive current density ($i_{pass}$) of $8.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ A/m².\n- Localized corrosion initiates at a pitting potential ($E_{pitt}$) of +0.480 V.\n\nFor alloys susceptible to this failure mode, their resistance is often correlated with the stability of the protective passive film. Two important metrics are the passive current density ($i_{pass}$), which indicates the film's general protectiveness, and the \"potential window for passivity,\" which can be defined as the range $\\Delta E = E_{pitt} - E_{corr}$. A larger window provides a greater margin of safety against potential fluctuations that could induce localized corrosion, a known precursor to SCC.\n\nBased on a comprehensive assessment of these electrochemical characteristics for this specific high-stress, high-chloride application, one alloy is deemed superior due to its greater predicted resistance to SCC. Calculate the ratio of the \"potential window for passivity\" of the superior alloy to that of the inferior alloy. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The user wants me to determine which of the two alloys, A or B, is superior for the given application and then to calculate the ratio of the \"potential window for passivity\" of the superior alloy to that of the inferior one.\n\nFirst, we must identify the superior alloy by analyzing the provided electrochemical data in the context of Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) in a high-chloride environment. The key parameters are the corrosion potential ($E_{corr}$), the passive current density ($i_{pass}$), and the pitting potential ($E_{pitt}$).\n\nLet's calculate the \"potential window for passivity,\" $\\Delta E = E_{pitt} - E_{corr}$, for each alloy.\n\nFor Alloy A:\nThe corrosion potential is $E_{corr, A} = -0.250$ V.\nThe pitting potential is $E_{pitt, A} = +0.320$ V.\nThe potential window for passivity is:\n$$ \\Delta E_A = E_{pitt, A} - E_{corr, A} = (+0.320 \\text{ V}) - (-0.250 \\text{ V}) = 0.570 \\text{ V} $$\n\nFor Alloy B:\nThe corrosion potential is $E_{corr, B} = -0.150$ V.\nThe pitting potential is $E_{pitt, B} = +0.480$ V.\nThe potential window for passivity is:\n$$ \\Delta E_B = E_{pitt, B} - E_{corr, B} = (+0.480 \\text{ V}) - (-0.150 \\text{ V}) = 0.630 \\text{ V} $$\n\nNext, we must compare the alloys to determine which is superior for resisting SCC.\n- **Passive Current Density ($i_{pass}$):** Alloy A has a significantly lower $i_{pass}$ ($1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ A/m²) compared to Alloy B ($8.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ A/m²). A lower $i_{pass}$ indicates a more stable, less defective passive film with a lower background dissolution rate. In terms of general corrosion, this would make Alloy A appear favorable.\n- **Pitting Potential ($E_{pitt}$):** Alloy B has a significantly higher $E_{pitt}$ ($+0.480$ V) compared to Alloy A ($+0.320$ V). The pitting potential is the critical potential at which the passive film breaks down locally, leading to pitting corrosion. Since the problem states that SCC is linked to localized corrosion, a higher $E_{pitt}$ implies greater resistance to the initiation event for SCC.\n- **Potential Window for Passivity ($\\Delta E$):** Alloy B has a wider potential window for passivity ($\\Delta E_B = 0.630$ V) than Alloy A ($\\Delta E_A = 0.570$ V). This means Alloy B can tolerate larger fluctuations in the system's electrochemical potential towards more oxidizing conditions before suffering from pitting.\n\n**Justification for Superiority:** The application involves high tensile stress and a high-chloride environment, conditions where SCC initiated by pitting is a major concern. Although Alloy A has a more \"perfect\" passive film (lower $i_{pass}$), its resistance to breakdown is substantially lower, as indicated by its lower $E_{pitt}$. Alloy B's ability to resist pitting up to a much higher potential ($+0.480$ V vs. $+0.320$ V) is the most critical factor for reliability in this aggressive environment. The higher pitting potential provides a larger safety margin against unforeseen operational excursions that might increase the corrosion potential. Therefore, Alloy B's significant advantage in resisting localized corrosion initiation makes it the superior choice for this application, despite its higher passive current density.\n\nSo, the superior alloy is Alloy B, and the inferior alloy is Alloy A.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the \"potential window for passivity\" of the superior alloy to that of the inferior alloy.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{superior}}}{\\Delta E_{\\text{inferior}}} = \\frac{\\Delta E_B}{\\Delta E_A} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{0.630 \\text{ V}}{0.570 \\text{ V}} = 1.105263... $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} \\approx 1.11 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.11}$$", "id": "1590734"}]}
