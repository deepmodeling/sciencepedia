Consider two ionic compounds, lithium fluoride (LiF) and cesium iodide (CsI), dissolved in a non-polar solvent such as benzene. We can model an ion pair as two spherical ions in direct contact. The stability of such a pair is determined by its electrostatic potential energy: a more stable pair has a lower (more negative) potential energy. According to a simplified electrostatic model, this energy is inversely proportional to the center-to-center distance between the two ions, which is the sum of their ionic radii.\n\nGiven the following ionic radii:\n- Lithium ion ($Li^{+}$): $76$ pm\n- Fluoride ion ($F^{-}$): $133$ pm\n- Cesium ion ($Cs^{+}$): $167$ pm\n- Iodide ion ($I^{-}$): $220$ pm\n\nBased on this model, which of the following statements correctly describes the relative stability of the LiF and CsI ion pairs in the non-polar solvent?\n\nA.
