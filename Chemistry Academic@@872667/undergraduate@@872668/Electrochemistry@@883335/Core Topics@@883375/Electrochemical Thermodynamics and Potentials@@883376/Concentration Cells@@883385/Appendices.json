To determine the potential difference measured by the voltmeter, we must analyze the electrical potentials at each interface within the system.\n\nLet's label the components:\n-   Electrode 1: The copper electrode in the solution with concentration $C_1$.\n-   Electrode 2: The copper electrode in the solution with concentration $C_2$.\n-   Solution 1: The $\\text{CuSO}_4$ solution with concentration $C_1$.\n-   Solution 2: The $\\text{CuSO}_4$ solution with concentration $C_2$.\n-   Connecting Wire: The copper wire connecting Solution 1 and Solution 2.\n\nLet's denote the electric potential of each component with the symbol $\\phi$. For instance, $\\phi_1$ is the potential of Electrode 1, and $\\phi_{S1}$ is the potential of Solution 1. The voltmeter measures the potential difference between Electrode 1 and Electrode 2, which is $\\Delta V = \\phi_1 - \\phi_2$.\n\nThe potential difference at the interface between a copper electrode and a copper(II) ion solution is described by the Nernst equation for the half-reaction $\\text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Cu}(s)$. The potential of the electrode relative to the solution is given by:\n$$E = E^\\circ_{\\text{Cu}^{2+}/\\text{Cu}} + \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln([\\text{Cu}^{2+}])$$\nHere, $E^\\circ_{\\text{Cu}^{2+}/\\text{Cu}}$ is the standard reduction potential for copper, $n=2$ is the number of electrons transferred, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\nWe can now write down the relationships for the potential differences at the various interfaces in our setup:\n\n1.  **Interface of Electrode 1 and Solution 1:** The potential difference is\n    $$\\phi_1 - \\phi_{S1} = E^\\circ_{\\text{Cu}^{2+}/\\text{Cu}} + \\frac{RT}{2F} \\ln(C_1)$$\n\n2.  **Interface of Electrode 2 and Solution 2:** The potential difference is\n    $$\\phi_2 - \\phi_{S2} = E^\\circ_{\\text{Cu}^{2+}/\\text{Cu}} + \\frac{RT}{2F} \\ln(C_2)$$\n\nThe key feature of this problem is the copper wire connecting the two solutions. This wire acts as a third metallic conductor submerged in both solutions. It will establish its own electrochemical equilibrium with each solution. Let the potential of the connecting wire be $\\phi_{CW}$.\n\n3.  **Interface of Connecting Wire and Solution 1:** Since the wire is made of copper, the same Nernst relation applies:\n    $$\\phi_{CW} - \\phi_{S1} = E^\\circ_{\\text{Cu}^{2+}/\\text{Cu}} + \\frac{RT}{2F} \\ln(C_1)$$\n\n4.  **Interface of Connecting Wire and Solution 2:** Similarly, for the other end of the wire:\n    $$\\phi_{CW} - \\phi_{S2} = E^\\circ_{\\text{Cu}^{2+}/\\text{Cu}} + \\frac{RT}{2F} \\ln(C_2)$$\n\nNow we have a system of four equations. Let's compare equation (1) and equation (3). They both have the same right-hand side.\n$$ \\phi_1 - \\phi_{S1} = \\phi_{CW} - \\phi_{S1} $$\nThis implies that $\\phi_1 = \\phi_{CW}$.\n\nNext, let's compare equation (2) and equation (4). They also share the same right-hand side.\n$$ \\phi_2 - \\phi_{S2} = \\phi_{CW} - \\phi_{S2} $$\nThis implies that $\\phi_2 = \\phi_{CW}$.\n\nFrom these two results, we can conclude that $\\phi_1 = \\phi_{CW} = \\phi_2$. The electric potentials of Electrode 1, Electrode 2, and the connecting copper wire are all equal.\n\nThe voltmeter measures the potential difference $\\Delta V = \\phi_1 - \\phi_2$. Since we have shown that $\\phi_1 = \\phi_2$, the potential difference is:\n$$ \\Delta V = \\phi_1 - \\phi_1 = 0 $$\n\nThe measured potential difference is 0 V. This is because the copper wire effectively \"shorts\" the two half-cells in a way that equalizes the potentials of the two external electrodes. For a potential difference to develop and be sustained as in a galvanic cell, a salt bridge is required. A salt bridge allows for the transport of ions to maintain charge neutrality in each half-cell as electrons flow through the external circuit. An electron-conducting wire cannot perform this function. Instead, it establishes its own equilibria with the solutions, forcing the entire metallic part of the circuit (the two electrodes and the connecting wire) to be at the same potential.
