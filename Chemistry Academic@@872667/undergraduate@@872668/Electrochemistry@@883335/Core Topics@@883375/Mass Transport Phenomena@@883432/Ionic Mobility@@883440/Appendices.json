Consider a simplified experiment where a long, straight microfluidic channel of length $L = 15.0 \\text{ cm}$ is filled with a dilute aqueous solution. A uniform electric field with a magnitude of $E = 2.00 \\times 10^4 \\text{ V/m}$ is applied along the entire length of the channel. A sample containing both lithium ions ($Li^+$) and cesium ions ($Cs^+$) is introduced at the start of the channel (at position $x=0$).\n\nThe ions begin to drift through the channel toward the detector at the other end. The limiting ionic mobility, $u$, which relates an ion's drift velocity to the applied electric field, is different for each ion due to variations in size and hydration shell.

The time it takes to travel the length of the channel, $L$, is:\n$$t_{Li^+} = \\frac{L}{v_{d, Li^+}} = \\frac{L}{u_{Li^+} E}$$\n\nSimilarly, for the cesium ion, its drift velocity is $v_{d, Cs^+} = u_{Cs^+} E$. The time it takes to travel the same distance $L$ is:\n$$t_{Cs^+} = \\frac{L}{v_{d, Cs^+}} = \\frac{L}{u_{Cs^+} E}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of these two times, $\\frac{t_{Li^+}}{t_{Cs^+}}$. We can set up this ratio using the expressions derived above:\n$$\\frac{t_{Li^+}}{t_{Cs^+}} = \\frac{\\frac{L}{u_{Li^+} E}}{\\frac{L}{u_{Cs^+} E}}$$\n\nWe can simplify this complex fraction. The terms for the channel length, $L$, and the electric field strength, $E$, are common to both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out:\n$$\\frac{t_{Li^+}}{t_{Cs^+}} = \\frac{L}{u_{Li^+} E} \\times \\frac{u_{Cs^+} E}{L} = \\frac{u_{Cs^+}}{u_{Li^+}}$$\nThis shows that the ratio of the travel times is inversely proportional to the ratio of the ionic mobilities.
