In intrinsic silicon at thermal equilibrium, the electron and hole concentrations are equal, so $n = p = n_{i}$, where $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration.\n\nPhosphorus is a group V element with five valence electrons. When phosphorus substitutes for silicon in the lattice, it contributes one extra valence electron that is weakly bound and can be thermally ionized at temperatures above absolute zero. Thus each donor supplies an electron to the conduction band according to the reaction $P \\rightarrow P^{+} + e^{-}$, and the material becomes n-type.\n\nFor an n-type semiconductor with donor concentration $N_{D}$ and negligible acceptor concentration, assuming donors are fully ionized, charge neutrality and thermal equilibrium give\n$$\nn \\approx N_{D},\n$$\nand the mass action law yields\n$$\nnp = n_{i}^{2} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad p = \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{n} = \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{D}} \\ll n.\n$$\nTherefore electrons are the majority carriers and holes are the minority carriers.\n\nThe ionic species $P^{+}$ and the silicon lattice ions are fixed in the crystal and are not mobile charge carriers responsible for electrical conduction on relevant time scales, so they cannot be majority or minority carriers.

Silicon (Si) is a Group 14 element. Boron (B) is a Group 13 element, meaning it has one fewer valence electron than silicon. When a boron atom substitutes a silicon atom in the crystal lattice, it creates a \"hole,\" which is the absence of an electron in the valence band. This hole can accept an electron, so boron acts as an acceptor dopant, creating a p-type semiconductor. The concentration of acceptors is given as $N_A = 4.5 \\times 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$.\n\nPhosphorus (P) is a Group 15 element, meaning it has one more valence electron than silicon. When a phosphorus atom substitutes a silicon atom, this extra electron is loosely bound and can be easily donated to the conduction band, becoming a free charge carrier. Thus, phosphorus acts as a donor dopant, creating an n-type semiconductor. The concentration of donors is given as $N_D = 1.2 \\times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$.\n\nWhen both donors and acceptors are present in the same region, the free electrons from the donor atoms will first fill the holes created by the acceptor atoms. This process is called compensation. The net type of the semiconductor and the concentration of the majority carriers are determined by the difference between the donor and acceptor concentrations.\n\nWe compare the concentrations $N_D$ and $N_A$:\n$N_D = 1.2 \\times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$\n$N_A = 4.5 \\times 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$\n\nSince $N_D > N_A$, the donor concentration is higher than the acceptor concentration. After all the acceptor sites have captured an electron from the donor atoms, there will still be an excess of electrons. Therefore, the counter-doped material is n-type, and the majority charge carriers are electrons.\n\nThe concentration of the majority carriers (electrons), denoted by $n$, is approximately equal to the net effective donor concentration, which is the difference between the donor and acceptor concentrations.\n$$n \\approx N_D - N_A$$\nThe problem states that the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$ is negligible, which validates this approximation.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the equation:\n$$n \\approx (1.2 \\times 10^{17} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}) - (4.5 \\times 10^{16} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3})$$\nTo perform the subtraction, we can express both terms with the same power of 10.
