{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "When a chemist determines the molecular formula of a new compound, the first question is often, \"What does it look like?\" A simple calculation called the degree of unsaturation, or index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), provides the first clue. This value reveals the total number of rings and $\\pi$ bonds within a molecule, immediately constraining the vast number of possible structures. Mastering this calculation, as you will in this exercise [@problem_id:2000180], is a fundamental first step in the logical process of deducing a molecule's structure from its formula.", "problem": "A team of organic chemists is investigating a newly synthesized compound intended for use in advanced materials science. Elemental analysis of the purified compound determines its molecular formula to be $C_{7}H_{5}NO_{3}$. To predict the compound's potential structure and reactivity, a crucial first step is to determine its degree of structural complexity in terms of cyclic and multiple-bond features. Calculate the total number of rings and pi bonds present in a molecule with this formula.", "solution": "To determine the total number of rings and pi bonds (the degree of unsaturation, DBE), use the standard formula for a molecular formula containing carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, halogens, and oxygen:\n$$\\text{DBE} = \\frac{2C + 2 + N - H - X}{2}.$$\nHere, $C$ is the number of carbons, $H$ is the number of hydrogens, $N$ is the number of nitrogens, and $X$ is the number of halogens. Oxygen does not affect the DBE and is omitted.\n\nFor $C_{7}H_{5}NO_{3}$, we have $C=7$, $H=5$, $N=1$, and $X=0$. Substituting:\n$$\\text{DBE} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 7 + 2 + 1 - 5 - 0}{2} = \\frac{14 + 2 + 1 - 5}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6.$$\n\nTherefore, the molecule has a total of $6$ rings and pi bonds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2000180"}, {"introduction": "Once we have a sense of the rings and $\\pi$ bonds in a molecule, we can zoom in to examine the bonding at each individual atom. The concept of hybridization ($sp^3$, $sp^2$, and $sp$) is the key to understanding the three-dimensional geometry and reactivity at specific sites within the molecule. By correctly identifying the hybridization of each carbon, you can predict bond angles and shapes, transforming a flat, 2D drawing into a more realistic 3D model. This problem [@problem_id:2000140] provides practice in this essential skill by analyzing the structure of vinyl acetate, a common industrial monomer.", "problem": "Vinyl acetate is an organic monomer used in the production of important polymers like polyvinyl acetate (PVA), a common adhesive. The chemical formula for vinyl acetate is $C_4H_6O_2$. Its structure consists of a methyl group ($CH_3-$) attached to a carbonyl carbon, which is part of an ester functional group. This ester group is then bonded to a vinyl group ($-CH=CH_2$).\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, the carbon atoms are numbered sequentially along the backbone as follows:\n$C_{(1)}H_3-C_{(2)}(=O)O-C_{(3)}H=C_{(4)}H_2$\n\nGiven this structure, identify the correct sequence of hybridization states for the carbon atoms $C_{(1)}$, $C_{(2)}$, $C_{(3)}$, and $C_{(4)}$, respectively.\n\nA. $sp^2, sp^2, sp^2, sp^2$\n\nB. $sp^3, sp^3, sp^2, sp^2$\n\nC. $sp^3, sp, sp, sp$\n\nD. $sp^3, sp^2, sp^2, sp^2$\n\nE. $sp^3, sp^2, sp^3, sp^3$", "solution": "We analyze each labeled carbon using the hybridization rule based on steric number, where the steric number equals the number of $\\sigma$ bonds plus the number of lone pairs on the atom. A steric number of $4$ corresponds to $sp^{3}$, of $3$ to $sp^{2}$, and of $2$ to $sp$.\n\nFor $C_{(1)}$ (the methyl carbon in $\\mathrm{CH_{3}}$), it forms four $\\sigma$ bonds (three to H and one to $C_{(2)}$), giving steric number $4$, hence hybridization $sp^{3}$.\n\nFor $C_{(2)}$ (the carbonyl carbon), it is bonded by a double bond to O (one $\\sigma$ and one $\\pi$) and by single bonds to $C_{(1)}$ and to the ester O, for a total of three $\\sigma$ bonds and no lone pairs on carbon. The steric number is $3$, so the hybridization is $sp^{2}$, consistent with trigonal planar carbonyl geometry.\n\nFor $C_{(3)}$ (the vinylic carbon attached to O), it is singly bonded to O and H and doubly bonded to $C_{(4)}$. Counting $\\sigma$ bonds, it has three $\\sigma$ bonds (to O, to H, and to $C_{(4)}$) and one $\\pi$ bond (to $C_{(4)}$), giving steric number $3$ and hybridization $sp^{2}$.\n\nFor $C_{(4)}$ (the terminal vinylic carbon in $\\mathrm{CH_{2}}$), it is singly bonded to two H atoms and has a double bond to $C_{(3)}$.

A common task for a chemist is to identify an unknown compound by observing its behavior in simple chemical tests. This hands-on practice [@problem_id:2000141] simulates this process by presenting you with a hypothetical scenario where you act as a chemical detective. By interpreting the results of several classic qualitative tests, you can use your knowledge of functional groups to logically deduce the structure of an unknown compound, integrating theoretical principles with practical observations.", "problem": "An unknown organic compound, designated as Compound X, is found to have the molecular formula $C_3H_6O$.

By the principle that Tollens' reagent oxidizes aldehydes (and certain $\\alpha$-hydroxy ketones), a negative test rules out aldehydes. Therefore, any structure containing an $-CHO$ group is excluded.\n\nObservation 2 states that metallic sodium produces a colorless, flammable gas. The relevant reaction is the formation of an alkoxide from an alcohol with evolution of hydrogen:\n$$2\\,ROH+2\\,Na\\rightarrow 2\\,RONa+H_{2}\\uparrow.$$\nThus, Compound X must contain an $O\\!-\\!H$ group (an alcohol). This eliminates ethers and simple carbonyls (which do not evolve $H_{2}$ with $Na$).\n\nObservation 3 states rapid decolorization of bromine in $CCl_{4}$, which is characteristic of electrophilic addition to a carbon–carbon multiple bond (typically $C=C$), leading to loss of the bromine color. Therefore, Compound X must possess a $C=C$ in addition to the $O\\!-\\!H$ group; combining with the IHD of $1$, this fits an unsaturated alcohol.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A (Propanal) is an aldehyde, which should give a positive Tollens' test; excluded by Observation 1.\n- B (Propanone) is a ketone; it lacks $O\\!-\\!H$ and does not evolve $H_{2}$ with $Na$; excluded by Observation 2, and it does not rapidly decolorize bromine in $CCl_{4}$; excluded by Observation 3.\n- C (Prop-2-en-1-ol, allyl alcohol) contains both an $O\\!-\\!H$ group and a $C=C$, so it is Tollens-negative, evolves $H_{2}$ with $Na$ via the alkoxide formation shown above, and rapidly decolorizes $Br_{2}$ in $CCl_{4}$ via addition to the double bond; consistent with all observations.\n- D (Cyclopropanol) contains an $O\\!-\\!H$ group and a ring (IHD $=1$) and is Tollens-negative and reacts with $Na$. Although cyclopropane rings can add halogens, the classical bromine test in $CCl_{4}$ diagnostically indicates a $C=C$ and is described as rapid decolorization for alkenes; the most likely choice matching all three observations in standard qualitative testing is an alkene alcohol rather than a cycloalkanol.\n- E (Methoxyethene) is an enol ether; ethers do not produce $H_{2}$ with $Na$; excluded by Observation 2.\n\nTherefore, the most likely identity of Compound X is prop-2-en-1-ol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2000141"}]}
