To properly characterize this material and document it, a complete and correct systematic description is required. Based on the established principles of inorganic nomenclature and coordination chemistry, analyze the provided formula.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the coordination number of the osmium center, its oxidation state, and the systematic International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name of the compound?\n\nA.

Coordination Number: 8; Oxidation State: +5; Name: Potassium amminepentacyanoosmate(V)", "solution": "We analyze the compound $K_{3}[\\mathrm{Os}(\\mathrm{NH}_{3})(\\mathrm{CN})_{5}]$ as an ionic salt composed of $3$ potassium cations and one complex anion $[\\mathrm{Os}(\\mathrm{NH}_{3})(\\mathrm{CN})_{5}]^{3-}$.\n\nFirst, determine the coordination number. The ligands are one $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ (ammine) and five $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$ (cyano). Both $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$ are monodentate ligands, each donating one lone pair to the metal center. Therefore, the total number of donor atoms bound to osmium is $1+5=6$, so the coordination number is $6$.\n\nNext, determine the oxidation state of osmium. Let the oxidation state of osmium be $x$. The overall charge on the complex anion is $-3$ to balance the three $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ cations. Using the rule that the sum of the oxidation states equals the overall charge of the species, and taking ligand charges as $0$ for $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ and $-1$ for each $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$, we write:\n$$\nx + 0 + 5(-1) = -3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x - 5 = -3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = +2.\n$$\nThus osmium is in the $+2$ oxidation state.\n\nFinally, assign the IUPAC name. For an anionic complex, the metal name takes the suffix “-ate”; for osmium, the anionic form is “osmate”. Ligands are cited in alphabetical order, ignoring multiplicative prefixes. Between “ammine” and “cyano”, “ammine” precedes “cyano” alphabetically. With one ammine and five cyano ligands, the ligand part is “amminepentacyano”. The cation is named first as “potassium” (without “tri-” in standard coordination nomenclature for such salts). The oxidation state of osmium is indicated in parentheses. Therefore, the systematic name is “potassium amminepentacyanoosmate(II)”.\n\nComparing with the options:\n- The coordination number is $6$.\n- The oxidation state is $+2$.\n- The correct ligand order is “ammine” before “cyano”, giving “potassium amminepentacyanoosmate(II)”.\n\nHence, the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1999942"}, {"introduction": "This final practice challenges you to think like a chemical detective, using established principles to uncover missing information.
