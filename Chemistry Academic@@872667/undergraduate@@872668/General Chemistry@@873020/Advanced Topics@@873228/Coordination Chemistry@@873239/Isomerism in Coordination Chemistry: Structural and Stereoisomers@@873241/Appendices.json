Crucially, elemental analysis confirms that this second compound has the exact same overall atomic composition as the first. However, when the red compound is dissolved in water and treated with barium chloride solution, no precipitate is observed.

The relevant precipitation equilibria are:\n$$Ba^{2+} + SO_{4}^{2-} \\to BaSO_{4}(s), \\quad Ag^{+} + Br^{-} \\to AgBr(s).$$\n\nFor the first compound, given as $[Co(NH_{3})_{5}Br]SO_{4}$ and observed to give an immediate dense white precipitate with $BaCl_{2}$, dissolution must produce free sulfate:\n$$[Co(NH_{3})_{5}Br]SO_{4} \\to [Co(NH_{3})_{5}Br]^{2+} + SO_{4}^{2-},$$\nso $Ba^{2+}$ forms $BaSO_{4}(s)$. Thus in this isomer, $SO_{4}^{2-}$ is the counterion and $Br^{-}$ is coordinated.\n\nFor the second compound, which has the same overall composition but gives no precipitate with $BaCl_{2}$ and does give a pale yellow $AgBr$ with $AgNO_{3}$, there must be no free $SO_{4}^{2-}$ in solution and there must be free $Br^{-}$. Therefore, upon dissolution it must ionize as\n$$[Co(NH_{3})_{5}SO_{4}]Br \\to [Co(NH_{3})_{5}SO_{4}]^{+} + Br^{-},$$\nso $Br^{-}$ is the counterion (giving $AgBr$ with $Ag^{+}$), and $SO_{4}^{2-}$ is coordinated (hence no $BaSO_{4}$ forms).
