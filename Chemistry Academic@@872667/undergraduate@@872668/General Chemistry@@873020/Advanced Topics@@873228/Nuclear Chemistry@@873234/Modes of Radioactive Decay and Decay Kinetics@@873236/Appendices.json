This causes the Boron-10 nucleus to undergo fission, producing a Lithium-7 nucleus and an alpha particle ($^{4}_{2}\\text{He}$). This reaction is highly effective at destroying cancer cells locally.\n\nSeparately, the radioactive isotope Yttrium-90 ($^{90}_{39}\\text{Y}$) is used in radioimmunotherapy. This isotope is a pure beta emitter, meaning it decays by emitting a beta particle and forming a stable daughter nuclide.\n\nBased on the principles of balancing nuclear equations, identify both the incident particle X in the boron fission reaction and the daughter nuclide produced from the beta decay of Yttrium-90.\n\nA) Particle X is a proton; the daughter nuclide is Zirconium-89 ($^{89}_{40}\\text{Zr}$).\n\nB) Particle X is a neutron; the daughter nuclide is Zirconium-90 ($^{90}_{40}\\text{Zr}$).\n\nC) Particle X is a proton; the daughter nuclide is Strontium-90 ($^{90}_{38}\\text{Sr}$).\n\nD) Particle X is a neutron; the daughter nuclide is Strontium-90 ($^{90}_{38}\\text{Sr}$).\n\nE) Particle X is an alpha particle; the daughter nuclide is Niobium-90 ($^{90}_{41}\\text{Nb}$).", "solution": "We determine particle X in the boron reaction by balancing mass number and atomic number in the stated fission process producing $^{7}_{3}\\mathrm{Li}$ and $^{4}_{2}\\mathrm{He}$.\n\nAssume particle X is a neutron: write\n$$^{10}_{5}\\mathrm{B} + {}^{1}_{0}\\mathrm{n} \\to {}^{7}_{3}\\mathrm{Li} + {}^{4}_{2}\\mathrm{He} \\; (+ \\gamma).$$\nCheck mass number $A$: left side $10 + 1 = 11$, right side $7 + 4 = 11$. Check atomic number $Z$: left side $5 + 0 = 5$, right side $3 + 2 = 5$. Both are conserved, so $^{1}_{0}\\mathrm{n}$ is consistent. If instead X were a proton, $^{1}_{1}\\mathrm{p}$, then $Z$ on the left would be $5 + 1 = 6 \\neq 5$ on the right, so it would not balance. Therefore, particle X is a neutron, in agreement with Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, which uses thermal neutrons.\n\nNext, we determine the daughter nuclide of $^{90}_{39}\\mathrm{Y}$, a pure beta emitter. In beta minus decay, a neutron converts to a proton and the nucleus transforms as\n$$^{A}_{Z}\\mathrm{X} \\to {}^{A}_{Z+1}\\mathrm{Y} + \\beta^{-} + \\bar{\\nu}_{e},$$\nso $A$ is unchanged and $Z$ increases by $1$.
