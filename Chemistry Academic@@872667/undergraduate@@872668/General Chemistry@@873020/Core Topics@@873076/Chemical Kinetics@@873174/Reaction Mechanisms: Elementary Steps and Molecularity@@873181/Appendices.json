Molecularity is a theoretical concept—an integer count of the species colliding in a single elementary step. In contrast, reaction order is an empirical value determined from experimental data, and it can be a non-integer for complex, multi-step reactions. This exercise [@problem_id:1979059] explores a scenario involving a non-integer reaction order, challenging you to recognize that this points to a complex mechanism rather than a fractional molecularity.", "problem": "An experimental investigation is conducted on the gas-phase thermal decomposition of a specific organic peroxide, denoted as R-O-O-R. The overall stoichiometry of the reaction is found to be:\n$$2 \\text{R-O-O-R}(g) \\rightarrow 2 \\text{R-O}(g) + \\text{O}_2(g)$$\nAfter collecting kinetic data at a constant temperature, the initial rate of reaction is found to follow the empirical rate law:\n$$\\text{Rate} = k[\\text{R-O-O-R}]^{1.5}$$\nwhere $k$ is the rate constant and $[\\text{R-O-O-R}]$ is the concentration of the organic peroxide.

Which of the following statements provides the most accurate reasoning regarding the relationship between the observed reaction order and the concept of molecularity?\n\nA. The proposal is correct. The molecularity of 1.5 represents a time-averaged number of reactant molecules participating in the rate-determining step.\n\nB. The proposal is incorrect. Molecularity is always an integer because it represents the number of species colliding in an elementary reaction step, but non-integer reaction orders are physically impossible and suggest experimental error.\n\nC. The proposal is incorrect. The overall reaction is complex, not elementary. While the empirical order for a complex reaction can be non-integer, the molecularity of any individual elementary step in its mechanism must be a positive integer.\n\nD. The proposal is correct. The non-integer order arises from a complex reaction mechanism involving fractional stoichiometric coefficients in the rate-determining elementary step, leading to a fractional molecularity.\n\nE. The proposal is incorrect. The concept of molecularity only applies to reactions in the liquid phase, whereas the observed reaction order applies to gas-phase reactions.", "solution": "The observed empirical rate law is $\\text{Rate} = k[\\text{R-O-O-R}]^{1.5}$, so the overall reaction order with respect to the peroxide (denote $A \\equiv \\text{R-O-O-R}$) is $1.5$. Reaction order is an empirical exponent in the rate law and can be non-integer for complex mechanisms.\n\nMolecularity, in contrast, is defined only for an individual elementary step as the number of reactant species whose simultaneous collision or transformation constitutes that step. Therefore, molecularity must be a positive integer (typically $1$, $2$, or rarely $3$) and is not defined for an overall reaction that is composed of multiple elementary steps.\n\nA standard kinetic origin of a non-integer order such as $3/2$ is a chain mechanism with a reactive intermediate whose steady-state concentration depends on $[A]^{1/2}$. For illustration, let $X$ be a radical intermediate generated during the thermal decomposition of $A$ and consider the elementary steps:\nInitiation: $A \\xrightarrow{k_{i}} 2X$ (unimolecular, molecularity $1$)\nPropagation: $X + A \\xrightarrow{k_{p}} \\text{products} + X$ (bimolecular, molecularity $2$)\nTermination: $2X \\xrightarrow{k_{t}} \\text{stable}$ (bimolecular, molecularity $2$)\n\nApplying the steady-state approximation to $[X]$ gives\n$$\n\\frac{d[X]}{dt} = 2k_{i}[A] - 2k_{t}[X]^{2} \\approx 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad [X] = \\left(\\frac{k_{i}}{k_{t}}\\right)^{1/2}[A]^{1/2}.\n$$\nThe rate of product formation is governed by the propagation step,\n$$\n\\text{Rate} = k_{p}[X][A] = k_{p}\\left(\\frac{k_{i}}{k_{t}}\\right)^{1/2}[A]^{3/2},\n$$\nwhich reproduces a $3/2$ order in $[A]$ without invoking any fractional number of molecules in a single collision. Each elementary step has integer molecularity; the non-integer overall order arises from the interplay of steps and the steady-state concentration of $X$.\n\nTherefore:\n- A is incorrect: molecularity is not a time-averaged fractional count; it is an integer per elementary step.\n- B is incorrect: non-integer reaction orders are physically possible and often observed in complex mechanisms.\n- C is correct: the overall reaction is complex, its empirical order may be non-integer, and the molecularity of each elementary step remains a positive integer.\n- D is incorrect: elementary steps do not have fractional stoichiometric coefficients or fractional molecularity.\n- E is incorrect: molecularity applies to elementary steps in any phase.\n\nHence, the colleague’s inference is not valid; the correct reasoning is given in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1979059"}, {"introduction": "Now we will apply our understanding to analyze a plausible reaction pathway.
