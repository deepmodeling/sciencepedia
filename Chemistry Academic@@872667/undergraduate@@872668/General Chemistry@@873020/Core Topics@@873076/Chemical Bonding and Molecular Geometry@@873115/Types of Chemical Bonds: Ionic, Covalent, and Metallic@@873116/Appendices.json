To identify the primary type of bonding in each solid (ionic, polar molecular, or metallic), the student performs a series of tests. The observations are recorded as follows:\n\n1.  **Solid A**: This solid is lustrous and malleable. It is an excellent conductor of electricity in its solid form. When a sample of Solid A is placed in water, it does not dissolve.\n2.  **Solid B**: This solid is a brittle, crystalline substance. It does not conduct electricity in its solid form.

Solid A is ionic, Solid B is polar molecular, Solid C is metallic.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify three unknown solids based on their physical and chemical properties, specifically their electrical conductivity and solubility in water. The possible identities are metallic, ionic, and polar molecular solids. We will analyze the properties of each solid one by one to determine its bonding type.\n\n**Analysis of Solid A:**\nThe key properties of Solid A are that it is an excellent conductor of electricity as a solid and it is insoluble in water.\n- **Electrical Conductivity:** Metallic solids are characterized by a \"sea\" of delocalized electrons that are free to move throughout the crystal lattice. This mobility of charge carriers makes metals excellent conductors of electricity in the solid state. Ionic and molecular solids do not have free-moving charge carriers in their solid state and are therefore electrical insulators.\n- **Solubility:** Metallic bonds are very strong and nonpolar. Metals are generally not soluble in a polar solvent like water.\nThe combination of high solid-state conductivity and insolubility in water is characteristic of a metallic solid. Therefore, Solid A is metallic.\n\n**Analysis of Solid B:**\nThe key properties of Solid B are that it is a non-conductor in its solid form, but it dissolves in water to form a solution that conducts electricity.\n- **Electrical Conductivity:** The solid does not conduct electricity, which rules out a metallic solid. Both ionic and molecular solids are typically non-conductive in the solid state. In an ionic solid, the ions are held in fixed positions within a crystal lattice and cannot move freely. In a molecular solid, the constituent particles are neutral molecules.\n- **Conductivity of Aqueous Solution:** When dissolved in water, the substance forms a conductive solution. This means that mobile charge carriers are present in the solution. This occurs when an ionic compound dissolves and dissociates into its constituent ions (e.g., $\\text{NaCl}(s) \\rightarrow \\text{Na}^{+}(aq) + \\text{Cl}^{-}(aq)$). These mobile ions can carry an electric current. A molecular solid, even if it dissolves, consists of neutral molecules in solution and thus does not conduct electricity.\nThe properties of being a non-conductor as a solid and a conductor when dissolved in water are the defining characteristics of an ionic solid. Therefore, Solid B is ionic.\n\n**Analysis of Solid C:**\nThe key properties of Solid C are that it does not conduct electricity in the solid state, it dissolves in water, and the resulting solution does not conduct electricity.\n- **Electrical Conductivity:** The solid is non-conductive, which is consistent with it being either an ionic or a molecular solid.\n- **Solubility and Solution Conductivity:** The solid dissolves in water, which for a molecular solid, suggests it is polar (following the \"like dissolves like\" principle, as water is polar). The crucial observation is that the resulting solution is non-conductive. This indicates that the dissolved particles are neutral and do not carry charge. This is the hallmark of a molecular solid, which dissolves as intact neutral molecules (e.g., sucrose, $\\text{C}_{12}\\text{H}_{22}\\text{O}_{11}$).\nThe combination of being a non-conductor in both the solid state and in aqueous solution, while still being soluble in water, is characteristic of a polar molecular solid. Therefore, Solid C is polar molecular.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis:\n- Solid A is metallic.\n- Solid B is ionic.\n- Solid C is polar molecular.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\nA. Solid A is metallic, Solid B is ionic, Solid C is polar molecular. - This matches our findings.\nB. Solid A is ionic, Solid B is metallic, Solid C is polar molecular. - Incorrect.\nC.
