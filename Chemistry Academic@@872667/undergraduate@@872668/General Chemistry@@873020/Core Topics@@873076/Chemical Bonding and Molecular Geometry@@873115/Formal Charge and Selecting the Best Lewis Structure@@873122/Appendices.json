The formula for calculating formal charge (FC) is:\n$$ \\text{FC} = (\\text{Number of valence electrons}) - (\\text{Number of non-bonding electrons}) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{Number of bonding electrons}) $$\nThe number of valence electrons for sulfur (S) is 6, and for oxygen (O) is 6. The total number of valence electrons for the ion is $6 + 3(6) + 2 = 26$. Both proposed structures use 26 electrons.\n\nFirst, let's analyze Alex's proposed structure, which obeys the octet rule.\nIn this structure, the central sulfur atom is single-bonded to three oxygen atoms and has one lone pair. To satisfy the octet rule, each oxygen atom must have three lone pairs.\nLet's calculate the formal charges:\n- For the central sulfur atom (S): It has 1 lone pair (2 non-bonding electrons) and 3 single bonds (6 bonding electrons).\n  $$ \\text{FC(S)} = 6 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(6) = 6 - 2 - 3 = +1 $$\n- For each of the three oxygen atoms (O): Each has 3 lone pairs (6 non-bonding electrons) and 1 single bond (2 bonding electrons).\n  $$ \\text{FC(O)} = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 6 - 6 - 1 = -1 $$\nThe formal charges in Alex's structure are S = +1, and each O = -1. The sum of the formal charges is $(+1) + 3(-1) = -2$, which correctly matches the ion's overall charge.\n\nNext, let's analyze Ben's proposed structure, which has an expanded octet for sulfur.\nIn this structure, the central sulfur atom has one lone pair, one double bond to an oxygen atom, and two single bonds to the other two oxygens. The sulfur atom has 10 electrons in its valence shell, which is allowed as it is in the third period.\nLet's calculate the formal charges:\n- For the central sulfur atom (S): It has 1 lone pair (2 non-bonding electrons), 1 double bond, and 2 single bonds. The number of bonding electrons is 8.\n  $$ \\text{FC(S)} = 6 - 2 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 6 - 2 - 4 = 0 $$\n- For the oxygen atom with a double bond (O=): It has 2 lone pairs (4 non-bonding electrons) and 1 double bond (4 bonding electrons).\n  $$ \\text{FC(O=)} = 6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 6 - 4 - 2 = 0 $$\n- For each of the two oxygen atoms with a single bond (O-): Each has 3 lone pairs (6 non-bonding electrons) and 1 single bond (2 bonding electrons).\n  $$ \\text{FC(O-)} = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 6 - 6 - 1 = -1 $$\nThe formal charges in Ben's structure are S = 0, one O = 0, and two O = -1. The sum of the formal charges is $(0) + (0) + 2(-1) = -2$, which also matches the ion's charge.\n\nNow we compare the two structures based on the principle of minimizing formal charges.\n- Alex's structure: Formal charges are (+1, -1, -1, -1).\n- Ben's structure: Formal charges are (0, 0, -1, -1).\n\nBen's structure has formal charges of smaller magnitudes (the sum of absolute values is $|0|+|0|+|-1|+|-1|=2$) compared to Alex's structure (sum of absolute values is $|+1|+|-1|+|-1|+|-1|=4$). Furthermore, Ben's structure places a formal charge of zero on the central atom and one of the oxygen atoms. The negative formal charges that remain are placed on oxygen, which is a highly electronegative atom, a favorable arrangement. Therefore, Ben's structure is considered the more representative or \"better\" Lewis structure because it minimizes formal charges.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. Ben's structure is the more representative model because the formal charges on the sulfur atom and one of the oxygen atoms are zero. This is consistent with our analysis.\nB. Alex's structure being better due to the octet rule is a common misconception. For period 3 elements and beyond, minimizing formal charge is often a more important criterion than strict adherence to the octet rule.\nC. Stating that double bonds are \"inherently more stable\" is an oversimplification and not the primary reason. The preference is based on the resulting formal charge distribution.\nD. Alex's structure has a formal charge of +1 on sulfur, which is less ideal than the 0 in Ben's structure. The magnitudes of charges are larger, not smaller.\nE. While Ben's structure does have three resonance forms (the double bond can be with any of the three oxygens), it is not a resonance structure *of* Alex's structure. They are two different bonding models.
