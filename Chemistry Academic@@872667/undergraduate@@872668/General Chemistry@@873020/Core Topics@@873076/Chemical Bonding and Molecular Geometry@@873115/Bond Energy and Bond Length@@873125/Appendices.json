While general periodic trends suggest bonds get weaker down a group, this is not always the case, especially when comparing single and multiple bonds. This conceptual problem [@problem_id:1980050] challenges you to rationalize why an O-O single bond is weaker than an S-S single bond, yet an O=O double bond is stronger than an S=S double bond, by dissecting the interplay between orbital overlap and lone-pair repulsion.", "problem": "Consider the elements oxygen (O) and sulfur (S), both located in Group 16 of the periodic table. Experimental measurements provide the following average bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE), which represent the energy required to break a specific bond:\n\n*   O=O double bond in diatomic oxygen (O$_{2}$): 498 kJ/mol\n*   S=S double bond in diatomic sulfur (S$_{2}$): 429 kJ/mol\n*   O-O single bond, as found in hydrogen peroxide (H$_{2}$O$_{2}$): 142 kJ/mol\n*   S-S single bond, as found in dihydrogen disulfide (H$_{2}$S$_{2}$): 266 kJ/mol\n\nBased on these data and the principles of chemical bonding, select the statement that provides the most complete and accurate physical explanation for the following two observations simultaneously:\n1. The O=O double bond is stronger than the S=S double bond.\n2. The O-O single bond is weaker than the S-S single bond.\n\nA. Oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, which consistently strengthens all bonds involving oxygen through increased ionic character. This effect explains why both the O=O and O-O bonds are stronger than their sulfur counterparts.\n\nB. The smaller atomic radius of oxygen leads to significant electrostatic repulsion between the lone pairs on adjacent atoms, which destabilizes and weakens the O-O single bond. However, this same small size allows for more effective side-by-side overlap of p-orbitals, forming a much stronger $\\pi$-bond in O=O compared to the weaker $\\pi$-bond formed by the larger, more diffuse orbitals of sulfur.\n\nC. The S-S single bond is stronger due to the ability of sulfur to utilize its d-orbitals for bonding, an option unavailable to oxygen. The O=O double bond is stronger primarily because the higher effective nuclear charge of oxygen pulls the bonding electrons closer and holds them more tightly.\n\nD. Both trends are anomalous. According to general periodic trends, bonds between smaller atoms are stronger. Therefore, both the O=O and O-O bonds should be stronger than the corresponding S=S and S-S bonds, suggesting the provided data for the S-S single bond strength is likely erroneous.\n\nE. The total strength of a double bond is dominated by the strength of its sigma ($\\sigma$) component. Since the S-S single ($\\sigma$) bond is stronger than the O-O single ($\\sigma$) bond, the S=S double bond should also be stronger. The provided data for the O=O bond must reflect unusual resonance stabilization in the O$_{2}$ molecule.", "solution": "Define the average bond dissociation enthalpy as $D(\\text{bond})$. The observations are summarized as:\n$$D(\\mathrm{O{=}O}) > D(\\mathrm{S{=}S}), \\quad D(\\mathrm{O{-}O}) < D(\\mathrm{S{-}S}).$$\nTo rationalize both trends simultaneously, invoke two standard bonding principles.\n\nFirst, the strength of a multiple bond can be approximated additively as\n$$D(\\mathrm{X{=}X}) \\approx D_{\\sigma}(\\mathrm{X{-}X}) + D_{\\pi}(\\mathrm{X{-}X}),$$\nwhere the $\\pi$ contribution is strongly dependent on the side-by-side overlap of the valence $p$ orbitals. The overlap integral $S_{\\pi}$ for $2p$–$2p$ overlap (in O) is larger than for $3p$–$3p$ overlap (in S) because $2p$ orbitals are more compact and better matched in radial extent and energy, yielding more effective side-by-side overlap. In molecular orbital language, the magnitude of the bonding–antibonding splitting for the $\\pi$ set scales with the resonance integral, which increases with orbital overlap; symbolically, $|\\beta_{\\pi}(2p,2p)| > |\\beta_{\\pi}(3p,3p)|$, so $D_{\\pi}(\\mathrm{O{-}O}) > D_{\\pi}(\\mathrm{S{-}S})$. Even if $D_{\\sigma}(\\mathrm{S{-}S}) \\gtrsim D_{\\sigma}(\\mathrm{O{-}O})$, the larger $\\pi$ term in oxygen makes\n$$D(\\mathrm{O{=}O}) = D_{\\sigma}(\\mathrm{O{-}O}) + D_{\\pi}(\\mathrm{O{-}O}) > D_{\\sigma}(\\mathrm{S{-}S}) + D_{\\pi}(\\mathrm{S{-}S}) = D(\\mathrm{S{=}S}).$$\nThus, the O=O double bond is stronger primarily due to a stronger $\\pi$ component arising from superior $2p$–$2p$ overlap.\n\nSecond, for single bonds between adjacent atoms that each carry lone pairs, the net bond strength can be modeled as\n$$D(\\mathrm{X{-}X}) \\approx D_{\\sigma}(\\mathrm{X{-}X}) - V_{\\mathrm{lp\\text{-}lp}}(\\mathrm{X{-}X}),$$\nwhere $V_{\\mathrm{lp\\text{-}lp}}$ denotes Pauli (lone pair–lone pair) repulsion, which grows rapidly as the internuclear distance decreases. Oxygen has a smaller covalent radius than sulfur, leading to a shorter $\\mathrm{O{-}O}$ bond length and closer proximity of multiple lone pairs on adjacent O atoms. This enhances $V_{\\mathrm{lp\\text{-}lp}}(\\mathrm{O{-}O})$ compared to $V_{\\mathrm{lp\\text{-}lp}}(\\mathrm{S{-}S})$, thereby reducing the net $D(\\mathrm{O{-}O})$ relative to $D(\\mathrm{S{-}S})$. Symbolically,\n$$V_{\\mathrm{lp\\text{-}lp}}(\\mathrm{O{-}O}) > V_{\\mathrm{lp\\text{-}lp}}(\\mathrm{S{-}S}) \\;\\Rightarrow\\; D(\\mathrm{O{-}O}) < D(\\mathrm{S{-}S}).$$\nThis captures the well-known weakness of the O–O single bond (as in peroxides) due to strong lone pair repulsion in a short bond.\n\nEvaluate the options against these physical principles:\n- A is incorrect because homonuclear bonds have zero electronegativity difference; invoking increased ionic character is inapplicable and it cannot explain $D(\\mathrm{O{-}O}) < D(\\mathrm{S{-}S})$.\n- B correctly attributes the weaker O–O single bond to enhanced lone pair repulsion from the small size of oxygen and the stronger O=O double bond to superior $2p$–$2p$ $\\pi$ overlap relative to diffuse $3p$–$3p$ overlap in sulfur.\n- C is incorrect because postulating significant d-orbital participation in S–S bonding is not supported by modern bonding theory for these cases; additionally, appealing solely to effective nuclear charge does not simultaneously account for both observed trends.\n- D is incorrect because the trends are not anomalous; the O–O single bond weakness is a standard consequence of lone pair repulsion, and double-bond strengthening in lighter elements follows from better $\\pi$ overlap.\n- E is incorrect because the $\\pi$ contribution is not negligible; it is decisive in distinguishing O=O from S=S. There is no special resonance in $\\mathrm{O_{2}}$ beyond the conventional molecular orbital description that would overturn the central role of $\\pi$ bonding.\n\nTherefore, only B provides a complete and accurate physical explanation for both observations simultaneously.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1980050"}, {"introduction": "The principles of thermochemistry and bond energy are not just for calculation; they are powerful tools for scientific inquiry and hypothesis testing.
