## Introduction
The concept of [orbital hybridization](@entry_id:140298) provides a powerful framework for understanding the three-dimensional shapes of molecules, successfully explaining the tetrahedral, trigonal planar, and linear geometries of compounds that adhere to the [octet rule](@entry_id:141395). However, chemistry is rich with molecules that defy this rule, featuring central atoms bonded to five, six, or even more neighbors. Species like phosphorus pentachloride ($PCl_5$) and sulfur hexafluoride ($SF_6$) possess stable, well-defined structures that simple $sp^3$, $sp^2$, or $sp$ hybridization cannot describe. This raises a critical question: how does [valence bond theory](@entry_id:145047) account for the geometries of these "[hypervalent](@entry_id:188223)" compounds?

This article addresses this knowledge gap by extending the hybridization model to include valence [d-orbitals](@entry_id:261792), leading to the $sp^3d$ and $sp^3d^2$ schemes. These advanced hybridization states provide a straightforward method for predicting and rationalizing the complex geometries observed in molecules that expand their octet. First, we will delve into the **Principles and Mechanisms** of $sp^3d$ and $sp^3d^2$ [hybridization](@entry_id:145080), exploring how these orbitals are formed and how they dictate the fundamental [trigonal bipyramidal](@entry_id:141216) and octahedral geometries. Next, the section on **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** will demonstrate how these structural concepts are applied to predict molecular properties, understand reaction mechanisms, and interpret spectroscopic data. Finally, you can solidify your understanding through a series of **Hands-On Practices** designed to test your ability to apply these theories to specific chemical examples.

## Principles and Mechanisms

While the [hybridization](@entry_id:145080) of $s$ and $p$ orbitals provides a robust framework for explaining the geometries of molecules adhering to the octet rule, many compounds, particularly those with central atoms from the third period and below, feature more than four electron domains. These "[hypervalent](@entry_id:188223)" or "octet-expansion" species require an extension of our valence bond model. To accommodate five or six electron domains, the model invokes the participation of valence $d$ orbitals, leading to the $sp^3d$ and $sp^3d^2$ [hybridization](@entry_id:145080) schemes. This chapter explores the principles governing these [hybridization](@entry_id:145080) states, the molecular geometries they produce, and the critical refinements needed for a more accurate physical picture.

### Extending Hybridization Beyond the Octet: $sp^3d$ and $sp^3d^2$ Orbitals

The fundamental premise of hybridization is that the number of hybrid orbitals formed on a central atom must equal the number of electron domains (bonding pairs and lone pairs) surrounding it. This number is often referred to as the **steric number**.

When the steric number is five, the central atom must provide five valence orbitals for mixing. This is accomplished by combining one $s$ orbital, three $p$ orbitals, and one $d$ orbital from the valence shell. This process, termed **$sp^3d$ hybridization**, generates a set of five equivalent hybrid orbitals. These orbitals orient themselves in space to minimize electrostatic repulsion, resulting in a **[trigonal bipyramidal](@entry_id:141216)** [electron-domain geometry](@entry_id:136747) [@problem_id:1997924].

When the steric number is six, as seen in molecules like sulfur hexafluoride ($SF_6$) or ions like hexafluorophosphate ($PF_6^-$), the central atom must furnish six valence orbitals. This is achieved through **$sp^3d^2$ hybridization**, which involves the mixing of one $s$ orbital, three $p$ orbitals, and two $d$ orbitals [@problem_id:1997892]. The resulting six [hybrid orbitals](@entry_id:260757) point toward the vertices of an octahedron, giving rise to an **octahedral** [electron-domain geometry](@entry_id:136747). This arrangement is characteristic of any species with six electron domains, whether they are all bonding pairs, as in $[\text{QCl}_6]^{2-}$, or a combination of bonding and [lone pairs](@entry_id:188362), as in [iodine](@entry_id:148908) pentafluoride, $IF_5$ [@problem_id:1997926] [@problem_id:1997918].

### The Trigonal Bipyramidal Framework: Geometries from Five Electron Domains

The [trigonal bipyramidal](@entry_id:141216) geometry, characteristic of $sp^3d$ [hybridization](@entry_id:145080), is unique in that its five positions are not all geometrically equivalent. It consists of two distinct types of positions:
*   Three **equatorial** positions, which lie in a single plane containing the central atom, separated by angles of $120^\circ$.
*   Two **axial** positions, which lie on an axis perpendicular to the equatorial plane, one above and one below.

This arrangement leads to a specific set of ideal [bond angles](@entry_id:136856). The angle between any two equatorial bonds is $120^\circ$. The angle between any axial bond and any equatorial bond is $90^\circ$. Finally, the two axial bonds are $180^\circ$ apart. The distinctness of these angles is fundamental to the geometry's properties. For instance, in a molecule with ideal [trigonal bipyramidal](@entry_id:141216) geometry, the dot product of two unit vectors representing distinct equatorial bonds is $\cos(120^\circ) = -1/2$ [@problem_id:1997897], and the ratio of the distance between two equatorial atoms to the distance between an axial and an equatorial atom can be shown to be $\sqrt{3/2}$ [@problem_id:1997909].

The presence of [lone pairs](@entry_id:188362) of electrons in a [trigonal bipyramidal](@entry_id:141216) framework introduces further complexity. To determine the most stable molecular geometry, we apply a key principle of VSEPR theory: electron-electron repulsion is minimized by placing lone pairs in positions that afford them the most space. Repulsion is strongest at $90^\circ$, moderate at $120^\circ$, and weakest at $180^\circ$.
*   An **axial** position has three neighboring positions at $90^\circ$ (the three equatorial positions).
*   An **equatorial** position has only two neighboring positions at $90^\circ$ (the two axial positions).

Therefore, to minimize the number of strong $90^\circ$ lone pair-bonding pair repulsions, **[lone pairs](@entry_id:188362) preferentially occupy equatorial positions**. This rule can be justified quantitatively. By assigning relative energy costs to different types of $90^\circ$ repulsions (Lone Pair-Lone Pair > Lone Pair-Bonding Pair > Bonding Pair-Bonding Pair), one can calculate that placing lone pairs in equatorial sites consistently yields the lowest total repulsion energy, and thus the most stable structure [@problem_id:1997938].

This principle allows for the systematic prediction of molecular geometries for molecules with five electron domains:
*   **$AX_5$ (e.g., $AsF_5$)**: No [lone pairs](@entry_id:188362). The [molecular geometry](@entry_id:137852) is **[trigonal bipyramidal](@entry_id:141216)**. [@problem_id:1997910]
*   **$AX_4E_1$ (e.g., $TeCl_4$)**: One lone pair. The lone pair occupies an equatorial position. The four bonded atoms form a shape known as a **seesaw**. [@problem_id:1997942]
*   **$AX_3E_2$ (e.g., $ClF_3$)**: Two [lone pairs](@entry_id:188362). Both [lone pairs](@entry_id:188362) occupy equatorial positions to be $120^\circ$ apart, minimizing LP-LP repulsion. The three bonded atoms form a **T-shaped** molecule. [@problem_id:1997931]
*   **$AX_2E_3$ (e.g., $I_3^-$)**: Three lone pairs. All three [lone pairs](@entry_id:188362) occupy the equatorial positions, forcing the two bonded atoms into the axial positions. The resulting [molecular geometry](@entry_id:137852) is **linear**.

### The Octahedral Framework: Geometries from Six Electron Domains

The [octahedral geometry](@entry_id:143692), arising from $sp^3d^2$ hybridization, is highly symmetric. All six positions are geometrically equivalent, and all adjacent [bond angles](@entry_id:136856) are $90^\circ$. This creates a simpler situation for placing lone pairs compared to the trigonal bipyramid. A molecule like [selenium](@entry_id:148094) hexafluoride ($SeF_6$) has 12 such $90^\circ$ F-Se-F bond angles, a direct contrast to the six $90^\circ$ F-P-F angles in [trigonal bipyramidal](@entry_id:141216) $PF_5$ [@problem_id:1997915].

The introduction of lone pairs into the octahedral framework follows VSEPR principles to minimize repulsion.
*   **$AX_6$ (e.g., $[AsF_6]^-$)**: No lone pairs. The [molecular geometry](@entry_id:137852) is **octahedral**. [@problem_id:1997910]
*   **$AX_5E_1$ (e.g., $BrF_5$, $IF_5$)**: One lone pair. Since all positions are initially equivalent, the lone pair can be placed at any vertex. The remaining five atoms form a **square pyramidal** geometry. The lone pair's increased repulsion will typically compress the [bond angles](@entry_id:136856) to be slightly less than $90^\circ$. [@problem_id:1997905] [@problem_id:1997918]
*   **$AX_4E_2$ (e.g., $XeCl_4$)**: Two lone pairs. To minimize the powerful lone pair-[lone pair repulsion](@entry_id:143030), the two lone pairs occupy positions opposite one another (i.e., *trans*), separated by $180^\circ$. This leaves the four bonded atoms in a single plane around the central atom, resulting in a **square planar** molecular geometry. [@problem_id:1997939]

### A Deeper Analysis of Hybridization with d-Orbitals

The simple [hybridization](@entry_id:145080) model is remarkably successful in predicting molecular geometries. However, a deeper examination reveals important subtleties and limitations, especially concerning the energetic cost and specific nature of [d-orbital participation](@entry_id:155563).

#### Orbital Selection and Directionality

Why are specific d-orbitals chosen for hybridization? The goal of forming sigma ($\sigma$) bonds is to create hybrid orbitals with maximum electron density directed along the bond axes. For an [octahedral geometry](@entry_id:143692), the bonds lie along the Cartesian axes. An analysis of the five standard $d$ orbitals ($d_{xy}$, $d_{yz}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$, and $d_{z^2}$) reveals that only the $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals have lobes of electron density pointing directly along the axes. The other three orbitals ($d_{xy}$, $d_{yz}$, $d_{xz}$) have their lobes oriented between the axes, with nodes along the axes themselves. Therefore, to construct six [hybrid orbitals](@entry_id:260757) for effective $\sigma$-bonding in an octahedral arrangement, the $s$, three $p$, and the axis-oriented $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals must be used [@problem_id:1997900].

#### Inequivalence in Trigonal Bipyramidal Structures

A significant failing of the simple $sp^3d$ model is its prediction of five equivalent bonds. Experimentally, for molecules like $PCl_5$, the two axial bonds are consistently longer and weaker than the three equatorial bonds. This can be rationalized by a more refined model of [hybridization](@entry_id:145080) that considers the distribution of $s$-character.

A more accurate description treats the equatorial and axial bonding schemes separately. The three equatorial orbitals can be modeled as a set of $sp^2$ hybrids, while the two axial orbitals can be modeled as a combination of a $p_z$ and a $d_{z^2}$ orbital ($pd$ hybrid). In this "decoupled" picture, the [s-orbital](@entry_id:151164) contributes exclusively to the equatorial bonds. The **fractional [s-character](@entry_id:148321)** of a hybrid orbital is strongly correlated with [bond strength](@entry_id:149044) and length: higher s-character leads to shorter, stronger bonds because s-orbitals are closer to the nucleus.

According to this refined model [@problem_id:1997927] [@problem_id:1997912]:
*   Each equatorial ($sp^2$) hybrid has $\frac{1}{3}$ or $33.3\%$ s-character.
*   Each axial ($pd$) hybrid has $0\%$ [s-character](@entry_id:148321).

This difference in s-character provides a compelling explanation for the observed difference in bond lengths and strengths. The greater s-character of the equatorial orbitals results in shorter, stronger bonds compared to the axial bonds, which lack any [s-character](@entry_id:148321) contribution. This concept can even be used to build quantitative models that relate observed bond lengths to the underlying orbital contributions [@problem_id:1997913].

#### Energetic Feasibility and Limitations

The invocation of [d-orbitals](@entry_id:261792) is not without energetic cost. An electron must be "promoted" from a lower-energy $s$ or $p$ orbital to a higher-energy $d$ orbital to make it available for hybridization. This **promotion energy** is a significant energetic penalty. For a [hypervalent](@entry_id:188223) molecule to be stable, this promotion energy must be more than compensated for by the energy released upon forming multiple, strong [covalent bonds](@entry_id:137054).

This principle explains why sulfur (Period 3) forms $SF_6$ but oxygen (Period 2) does not form $OF_6$. For oxygen, the valence shell is $n=2$, which contains no $d$ orbitals. To form six bonds, an electron would need to be promoted to the $n=3$ shell (e.g., to a $3d$ orbital), which is an extremely large energy gap. For sulfur, the valence shell is $n=3$, and its $3d$ orbitals, while higher in energy than the $3s$ and $3p$, are energetically accessible. The energy released by forming six strong S-F bonds is sufficient to overcome the promotion energy for sulfur. For oxygen, the enormous promotion energy combined with weaker O-F bonds makes the formation of $OF_6$ energetically prohibitive [@problem_id:1997941].

### Modern Perspectives: Bonding in Hypervalent Molecules without d-Orbitals

The classic hybridization model involving d-orbitals is a useful predictive tool, but modern quantum chemical calculations show that the actual participation of d-orbitals in the bonding of main-group [hypervalent](@entry_id:188223) compounds is minimal. The energy of these [d-orbitals](@entry_id:261792) is generally too high for them to mix effectively with s and p orbitals.

A more accurate model that avoids invoking d-orbitals is the **three-center, four-electron (3c-4e) bond**, proposed by Pimentel and Rundle. This model is particularly useful for describing the linear, three-atom bonding arrangements common in [hypervalent](@entry_id:188223) structures.

Let's reconsider the T-shaped $ClF_3$ molecule. Instead of $sp^3d$ hybridization, we can describe the bonding as follows [@problem_id:1997929]:
1.  The central chlorine atom undergoes **$sp^2$ hybridization**. These three planar orbitals are used to form the single, stronger equatorial Cl-F bond and to house the two lone pairs.
2.  The remaining unhybridized $p$-orbital on chlorine (e.g., $p_z$) aligns with the $p$-orbitals of the two axial fluorine atoms. These three orbitals combine to form a linear [3c-4e bond](@entry_id:144668). This results in one bonding MO, one non-bonding MO, and one anti-bonding MO. The four valence electrons (two from Cl, one from each F) fill the bonding and non-bonding MOs, creating a stable system that bonds all three atoms together.

This model has several advantages: it avoids the energetically costly [d-orbital participation](@entry_id:155563), and it naturally accounts for the observation that axial bonds are longer and weaker than the equatorial bond. A similar approach, rooted in Molecular Orbital (MO) theory, can describe the bonding in octahedral $SF_6$ without needing sulfur's 3d orbitals. In the MO picture, the bonding arises from the interaction of sulfur's $3s$ and $3p$ orbitals with [symmetry-adapted linear combinations](@entry_id:139983) of the fluorine orbitals, resulting in a set of [delocalized bonding](@entry_id:268887) and non-[bonding molecular orbitals](@entry_id:183240) that accommodate the valence electrons [@problem_id:1359086].

In summary, while the $sp^3d$ and $sp^3d^2$ [hybridization](@entry_id:145080) schemes serve as powerful and simple pedagogical tools for predicting the geometries of [hypervalent molecules](@entry_id:141103), it is crucial to recognize them as a heuristic. The underlying physical reality, better described by models like the [3c-4e bond](@entry_id:144668) and full [molecular orbital theory](@entry_id:137049), is one of [multi-center bonding](@entry_id:199245) that does not rely on significant [d-orbital participation](@entry_id:155563) for main-group elements.
