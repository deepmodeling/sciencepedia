A common mistake is to assume that more polar bonds always lead to a larger molecular dipole moment. This problem [@problem_id:1998882] explores the classic and counterintuitive comparison of ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$) and nitrogen trifluoride ($\\text{NF}_3$), demonstrating the critical importance of treating bond dipoles as vectors whose orientation determines whether they reinforce or partially cancel each other.", "problem": "Two undergraduate chemistry students are debating the relative strengths of intermolecular forces in ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$) and nitrogen trifluoride ($\\text{NF}_3$). Both molecules are known to have a trigonal pyramidal geometry with a lone pair of electrons on the central nitrogen atom.\n\nThe first student argues: \"Fluorine is the most electronegative element, and hydrogen is significantly less electronegative than nitrogen. The electronegativity difference between nitrogen and fluorine is much larger than between nitrogen and hydrogen. Therefore, the N-F bonds are much more polar than the N-H bonds. A molecule with more polar bonds must have a larger overall molecular dipole moment, so $\\text{NF}_3$ will exhibit stronger dipole-dipole interactions than $\\text{NH}_3$.\"\n\nThe second student counters: \"It's more complex. The final molecular dipole moment is the vector sum of all individual bond dipoles and the contribution from the lone pair.

The first student is correct. The greater electronegativity difference in the N-F bonds guarantees that $\\text{NF}_3$ has a larger net molecular dipole moment and thus stronger dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nB. The second student is correct. In $\\text{NH}_3$, the dipoles of the three N-H bonds and the dipole contribution of the lone pair all point in a similar general direction, leading to a large net molecular dipole. In $\\text{NF}_3$, the dipoles of the highly polar N-F bonds oppose the dipole contribution of the lone pair, leading to partial cancellation and a small net molecular dipole. Therefore, $\\text{NH}_3$ has stronger dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nC. The first student is correct, but for the wrong reason. Both molecules have nearly identical molecular dipole moments, but the much larger molar mass of $\\text{NF}_3$ causes it to have stronger dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nD. Both students are fundamentally mistaken. Due to the trigonal symmetry, the bond dipoles in both $\\text{NH}_3$ and $\\text{NF}_3$ cancel out completely, resulting in nonpolar molecules with zero dipole moment. Their primary intermolecular forces are London dispersion forces.\n\nE. The second student is correct, but the reasoning is flawed. The lone pair in $\\text{NF}_3$ is more diffuse and polarizable because of the electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms, and this effect is what primarily reduces its contribution to the overall dipole moment, making $\\text{NH}_3$ more polar.", "solution": "We analyze the molecular dipole as a vector sum of all contributing dipoles.

Using the provided Pauling values, the ordering is\n$$\n\\chi_{\\text{F}}\\chi_{\\text{N}}\\chi_{\\text{H}}.\n$$\nTherefore:\n- In $\\text{NH}_{3}$, each N–H bond dipole points toward nitrogen (toward the more electronegative atom), i.e., toward the lone pair direction.

In $\\text{NF}_{3}$ the three, more polar N–F bond dipoles subtract from the lone-pair contribution, causing partial cancellation and a smaller net dipole. Since dipole-dipole interaction strength increases with the magnitude of the molecular dipole, $\\text{NH}_{3}$ exhibits stronger dipole-dipole interactions than $\\text{NF}_{3}$.\n\nThis matches the second student’s reasoning: the vector orientation of bond dipoles relative to the lone pair is decisive, not merely the bond polarity magnitude.
