These together indicate a covalent-network solid (e.g., diamond or silica), which has a wide band gap and strong directional covalent bonds. Therefore C is covalent-network.\n\nD: Very low conductivity as a solid but high conductivity as a liquid, along with a hard, brittle character and a moderately high melting point. This is the classic signature of an ionic solid, where ions are immobilized in the crystal but mobile when molten.

This thought experiment [@problem_id:2027029] delves deeper by asking you to predict how ion size and shape influence melting point, a property directly tied to lattice energy. You will apply the principles of Coulomb's law to see how the geometry and distance between ions critically affect the stability of an ionic crystal.", "problem": "A chemist is synthesizing and comparing two different ionic compounds, Compound A and Compound B.\n\n- **Compound A** is composed of a small, spherical cation, $\\text{M}^+$, and a small, spherical anion, $\\text{X}^-$.

The magnitude of the charge on each ion is identical to that in Compound A (i.e., +1 and -1).\n\nBased on the fundamental principles governing the properties of ionic solids, how would you expect the melting point of Compound B to compare to that of Compound A? Choose the most accurate statement from the options below.\n\nA. The melting point of Compound B will be higher than that of Compound A because the larger ions in Compound B have greater mass, leading to stronger attractions.\n\nB. The melting points of Compound A and Compound B will be nearly identical because the magnitude of the ionic charges, which is the most important factor, is the same for both.\n\nC. The melting point of Compound B will be significantly higher than that of Compound A because the complex shapes of the ions in Compound B create a more interlocked and stable crystal structure.\n\nD. The melting point of Compound B will be significantly lower than that of Compound A because the bulky, irregular shapes of its ions hinder efficient packing, increasing the distance between ionic centers and weakening the overall electrostatic forces in the lattice.", "solution": "We compare melting points of ionic solids by the magnitude of their cohesive energy, which is well correlated with the lattice energy. For an ionic crystal, the electrostatic potential between ions at separation $r$ is given by Coulomb’s law:\n$$\nV(r) = \\frac{z_{+} z_{-} e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} r}.\n$$\nSumming over the crystal gives the lattice energy (Born–Landé model):\n$$\nU_{\\text{lat}} = -\\frac{N_{A} M z_{+} z_{-} e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} r_{0}} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $N_{A}$ is Avogadro’s number, $M$ is the Madelung constant (depends on lattice geometry and packing), $z_{+}$ and $z_{-}$ are the ionic charges, $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum permittivity, $r_{0}$ is the nearest-neighbor cation–anion distance, and $n$ is the Born exponent.\n\nFor Compound A, with small, spherical ions forming a rock-salt-type lattice, $M$ is relatively large (efficient packing and high coordination), and $r_{0}$ is small. With $z_{+} = +1$ and $z_{-} = -1$, the magnitude $|U_{\\text{lat}}|$ is large, which corresponds to a high melting point.\n\nFor Compound B, although the charges are the same ($z_{+} = +1$, $z_{-} = -1$), the ions are large and irregular. This has two key consequences:\n- The center-to-center distance $r_{0}$ increases due to steric bulk and hindered close approach. Since $|U_{\\text{lat}}| \\propto \\frac{1}{r_{0}}$, increasing $r_{0}$ decreases $|U_{\\text{lat}}|$.\n- The packing is inefficient and the coordination environment is disrupted by non-sphericity, which effectively reduces the Madelung constant $M$ relative to highly symmetric lattices. Since $|U_{\\text{lat}}| \\propto M$, a smaller effective $M$ further decreases $|U_{\\text{lat}}|$.\n\nTherefore, both the increase in $r_{0}$ and the decrease in effective $M$ weaken the overall electrostatic lattice stabilization. A lower $|U_{\\text{lat}}|$ generally yields a lower melting point. This reasoning rules out the alternative options:\n- Greater mass (Option A) does not increase electrostatic attractions; mass is not the controlling factor for lattice energy.\n- Equal charges alone (Option B) are insufficient to predict equal melting points because $r_{0}$ and $M$ strongly influence $U_{\\text{lat}}$.\n- Interlocking shapes (Option C) do not enhance the long-range Coulombic stabilization; shape irregularity typically disrupts packing and lowers $M$ and thus $|U_{\\text{lat}}|$.\n\nHence, Compound B is expected to have a significantly lower melting point than Compound A due to weakened electrostatic cohesion from increased ionic separation and poor packing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2027029"}]}
