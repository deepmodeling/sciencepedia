Dissolving a small amount of solid potassium nitrate ($KNO_3$).", "solution": "The question asks to identify which procedure will cause the equilibrium to shift in a direction that makes the solution more intensely blue. The blue-colored species is the tetrachlorocobaltate(II) ion, $[CoCl_4]^{2-}$, which is on the product side of the given reaction. Therefore, we need to find the procedure that shifts the equilibrium to the right. We will analyze each option using Le Châtelier's principle, which states that if a change of condition is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system will shift in a direction that counteracts the change.\n\nThe equilibrium reaction is:\n$$[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}(aq, \\text{pink}) + 4 Cl^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons [CoCl_4]^{2-}(aq, \\text{blue}) + 6 H_2O(l) \\quad (\\Delta H > 0)$$\n\n**Analysis of Option A: Adding a large volume of distilled water.**\nAdding water has two effects. First, it dilutes all the dissolved species ($[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$, $Cl^-$, and $[CoCl_4]^{2-}$). The reactant side has $1+4=5$ moles of aqueous ions, while the product side has only 1 mole of aqueous ions. To counteract the overall decrease in concentration, the equilibrium will shift to the side with a greater number of dissolved particles, which is the left side. Second, water ($H_2O$) is a product in the reaction. Increasing the concentration of a product will cause the equilibrium to shift to the left to consume the added product. Both effects push the equilibrium to the left, favoring the formation of the pink $[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$ ion. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B: Adding a small amount of solid silver nitrate ($AgNO_3$).**\nSolid silver nitrate dissolves in the aqueous solution to produce silver ions ($Ag^+$) and nitrate ions ($NO_3^-$). The silver ions will react with the chloride ions ($Cl^-$) in the solution to form solid silver chloride ($AgCl$), which is insoluble and precipitates out. The net ionic reaction for the precipitation is $Ag^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq) \\rightarrow AgCl(s)$. This process removes chloride ions, a reactant in the main equilibrium, from the solution. According to Le Châtelier's principle, a decrease in the concentration of a reactant will cause the equilibrium to shift to the left to replenish the removed reactant. This shift favors the pink complex. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C: Placing the sample in an ice bath at 0 °C.**\nPlacing the sample in an ice bath lowers the temperature of the system. The problem states that the forward reaction is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat ($\\Delta H > 0$). Consequently, the reverse reaction is exothermic (releases heat, $\\Delta H  0$). According to Le Châtelier's principle, if the temperature is decreased, the equilibrium will shift in the exothermic direction to produce heat and counteract the cooling. Therefore, the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the formation of the pink $[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$ ion. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option D: Adding a few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid ($HCl$).**\nHydrochloric acid is a strong acid that fully dissociates in water, providing a high concentration of hydrogen ions ($H^+$) and chloride ions ($Cl^-$). The addition of concentrated $HCl$ significantly increases the concentration of $Cl^-$ in the system. Chloride ion is a reactant in the equilibrium. According to Le Châtelier's principle, an increase in the concentration of a reactant will cause the equilibrium to shift to the right to consume the added reactant. This shift favors the formation of the products, including the blue $[CoCl_4]^{2-}$ ion. Thus, option D is correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option E: Dissolving a small amount of solid potassium nitrate ($KNO_3$).**\nSolid potassium nitrate dissolves to yield potassium ions ($K^+$) and nitrate ions ($NO_3^-$). Neither of these ions participates directly in the cobalt complex equilibrium. They are spectator ions. Their addition does not significantly change the concentrations of the reacting species or the temperature. Therefore, adding potassium nitrate will not cause a significant shift in the equilibrium position. The color of the solution will remain largely unchanged. Thus, option E is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis of all options, only the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid will shift the equilibrium to the right and cause the solution to become more intensely blue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2002306"}, {"introduction": "While Le Châtelier's principle tells us the *direction* of an equilibrium shift, quantitative chemistry allows us to predict its *magnitude*.
