The ions $P^{3-}$, $S^{2-}$, $Cl^{-}$, $K^{+}$, and $Ca^{2+}$ are isoelectronic, each having the same electron count as the noble gas argon. For an isoelectronic series, the physical principle is that $r$ decreases as the nuclear charge $Z$ increases because a larger $Z$ exerts a stronger Coulombic attraction on the same number of electrons, leading to greater effective nuclear charge and a more contracted electron cloud.

The small discrepancy (5 pm) is expected in real-world measurements and simplified models. Let's check the differences for the other ions to confirm our choice:\n- Difference with K⁺: $|133 - 138| = 5$ pm\n- Difference with Na⁺: $|133 - 102| = 31$ pm\n- Difference with Rb⁺: $|133 - 152| = 19$ pm\n\nThe difference between our calculated radius and the radius of K⁺ is significantly smaller than the differences for its neighbors, Na⁺ and Rb⁺.
