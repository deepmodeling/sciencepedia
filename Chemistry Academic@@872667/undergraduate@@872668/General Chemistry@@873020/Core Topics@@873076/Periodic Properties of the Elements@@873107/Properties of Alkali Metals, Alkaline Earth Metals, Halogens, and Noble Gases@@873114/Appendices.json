The second ionization energy of An is prohibitively high, which destabilizes the $An^+$ ion in the $AnCl$ lattice, favoring its conversion back to elemental $An(s)$.\n\nB. The electron affinity of chlorine is the primary factor driving the formation of $AnCl_2$ over $AnCl$ because two chloride ions provide a much more significant energy release than one.\n\nC. The formation of solid $AnCl$ is an endothermic process, making the compound intrinsically unstable relative to its constituent elements.\n\nD.

This directly explains the thermodynamic favorability of disproportionation.\n\nFrom the derived expression, we can also evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because $I_{2}$ pertains to forming $An^{2+}$ for $AnCl_{2}$, not to destabilizing $An^{+}$ in $AnCl$; the reaction proceeds despite the large $I_{2}$ because of the lattice stabilization in $AnCl_{2}$.\n- B is incorrect because the electron affinity terms cancel in $\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$; they are not the primary driver.\n- C is not the general reason; the sign of $\\Delta H_{f}(AnCl)$ does not govern the favorability of the disproportionation, which depends on the difference captured above.\n- E is incorrect because the sublimation term appears as $-S$ in $\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$, so a larger $S$ would actually favor the reaction, and in any case it is not the dominant term controlling the difference.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental reason is the much larger energy released in forming the $AnCl_{2}$ lattice, sufficient to offset the extra ionization cost, which is precisely statement D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2013607"}]}
