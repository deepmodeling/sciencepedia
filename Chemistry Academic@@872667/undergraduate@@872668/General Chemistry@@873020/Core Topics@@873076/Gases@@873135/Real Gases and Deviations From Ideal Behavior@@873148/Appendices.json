Between $H_{2}O$ and Ar, values are close, but $H_{2}O$ is effectively very compact, so it can reasonably have a slightly smaller $b$ than Ar.\n\nStep 3: Match the sets using the given $(a,b)$ values.\n- Identify the set with the largest $a$: Set 2 has $a=5.536$, clearly the largest; assign Set 2 to $H_{2}O$.\n- Identify the set with the largest $b$: Set 1 has $b=0.04278$, the largest; assign Set 1 to $CH_{4}$.\n- The remaining set, Set 3, is then assigned to Ar.\n\nStep 4: Consistency checks.\n- The assigned $a$ values satisfy $a(H_{2}O)a(CH_{4})a(Ar)$, consistent with polarity and polarizability.\n- The assigned $b$ values satisfy $b(CH_{4})b(Ar)\\gtrsim b(H_{2}O)$, consistent with molecular size expectations.\n\nTherefore, the correct assignment is $H_{2}O$: Set 2, Ar: Set 3, $CH_{4}$: Set 1, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2015896"}, {"introduction": "With a solid conceptual grasp of the van der Waals parameters, we can now explore their quantitative impact.
