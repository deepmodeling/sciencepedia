A system will spontaneously evolve towards the state with the highest number of accessible microscopic configurations, which corresponds to the highest entropy. This practice provides a quantitative look at this principle by calculating the entropy change when molecules expand into a vacuum, a classic example of a process driven purely by the increase in positional disorder.

Since the device is isolated and the gas is ideal, the internal energy $U$ depends only on temperature $T$. There is no work done and no heat exchange during the free expansion, so $U$ remains constant, implying $T$ remains constant.\n\nEntropy is a state function, so we compute the entropy change by connecting the same initial and final states with a reversible isothermal path.
