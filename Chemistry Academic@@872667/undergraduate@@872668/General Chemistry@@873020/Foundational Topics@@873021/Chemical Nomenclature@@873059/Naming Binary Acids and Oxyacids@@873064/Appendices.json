The \"hydro-\" prefix should only be used for binary acids, which do not contain oxygen.\n\nB. The suffix should be \"-ous\" instead of \"-ic\" because the acid contains chlorine.\n\nC. The prefix \"per-\" should have been added because the acid is a strong electrolyte.\n\nD. The name \"hydrochloric acid\" is correct, but it only applies when $HClO_3$ is dissolved in water.\n\nE. The name of an acid should be based on the hydrogen cation, so it should be named \"hydrogen chlorate\".", "solution": "To determine the correct name for $HClO_3$ and diagnose the student's error, apply the standard rules of inorganic acid nomenclature:\n\n1. Distinguish between binary acids and oxyacids.\n   - Binary acids consist of hydrogen and a single nonmetal with no oxygen, typically of the form $HX$. When dissolved in water, they are named with the prefix \"hydro-\", the root of the nonmetal, and the suffix \"-ic acid\". For example, $HCl(aq)$ is named \"hydrochloric acid\".\n   - Oxyacids contain hydrogen, a nonmetal, and oxygen. Their names are derived from the corresponding oxoanions: anions ending in \"-ate\" give acids ending in \"-ic\", and anions ending in \"-ite\" give acids ending in \"-ous\". The \"hydro-\" prefix is not used for oxyacids.\n\n2. Identify the relevant oxoanion for $HClO_3$.\n   - The anion $ClO_3^{-}$ is named \"chlorate\". Therefore, the acid $HClO_3$, which corresponds to chlorate, is named \"chloric acid\" by replacing \"-ate\" with \"-ic\".\n\n3. Contrast with the student's answer and evaluate the options.\n   - The student's name \"hydrochloric acid\" corresponds to $HCl(aq)$, a binary acid, not to $HClO_3$, an oxyacid. The error is the misuse of the \"hydro-\" prefix for an oxyacid.\n   - Option A correctly states that the \"hydro-\" prefix should only be used for binary acids, which do not contain oxygen.\n   - Option B is incorrect because the \"-ous\" suffix applies to the \"-ite\" oxoanion (e.g., $HClO_2$ is chlorous acid), not merely due to the presence of chlorine.\n   - Option C is incorrect because the \"per-\" prefix refers to the oxyacid with the highest oxygen content in a series (e.g., $HClO_4$ is perchloric acid), not to electrolyte strength.\n   - Option D is incorrect because \"hydrochloric acid\" refers specifically to $HCl(aq)$, not $HClO_3$.\n   - Option E is incorrect because acid naming is based on the associated anion, not by naming the hydrogen cation explicitly; \"hydrogen chlorate\" is not the acid name.\n\nTherefore, the primary error is the misuse of the \"hydro-\" prefix for an oxyacid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2007295"}, {"introduction": "Once you can confidently distinguish binary acids from oxyacids, the next skill is to navigate the systematic patterns within oxyacid families.

Successfully solving this requires a deep understanding of both reaction chemistry and the distinct rules for binary acids versus oxyacids.", "problem": "In a chemical synthesis experiment, a student bubbles gaseous selenium trioxide ($SeO_3$) through a container of pure water, producing a homogeneous acidic solution. The student proposes the name 'hydroselenic acid' for the chemical species responsible for the solution's acidity. However, this name has at least two fundamental flaws based on the standard IUPAC nomenclature rules for inorganic acids.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately identifies and explains two major flaws in the student's proposed name for the product?\n\nA. Flaw 1: The product is a binary acid, but the suffix should be \"-ous\" because selenium is less electronegative than oxygen. Flaw 2: The prefix \"hydro-\" is reserved for acids containing a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I).\n\nB. Flaw 1: The name \"hydroselenic acid\" correctly designates the binary acid $H_2Se$, but the reaction of the nonmetal oxide $SeO_3$ with water produces the oxyacid $H_2SeO_4$. Flaw 2: The \"hydro-\" prefix is used exclusively for binary acids (e.g., $HCl$), and must not be used when naming an oxyacid.\n\nC. Flaw 1: The oxidation state of selenium in the product is +4, which requires the suffix \"-ous,\" not \"-ic.\" Flaw 2: The name is ambiguous and should follow the Stock system, such as \"hydroselenic (VI) acid,\" to indicate the oxidation state.\n\nD. Flaw 1: The correct suffix is \"-ate\" because the product formed is an ionic salt, not a molecular acid. Flaw 2: The \"hydro-\" prefix is redundant because the term \"acid\" already implies an aqueous solution.\n\nE. Flaw 1: The reaction of $SeO_3$ with water is a disproportionation reaction that produces both $H_2SeO_3$ and $H_2Se$, so a single name is insufficient. Flaw 2: The proper name for the substance in solution is simply \"aqueous selenium trioxide\".", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the two main flaws in naming the product of the reaction between selenium trioxide ($SeO_3$) and water ($H_2O$) as \"hydroselenic acid\".\n\nFirst, let's determine the chemical reaction and its product. The reaction between a nonmetal oxide (an acid anhydride) and water produces an oxyacid. In this case, selenium trioxide reacts with water to form selenic acid.\n$$SeO_3(g) + H_2O(l) \\rightarrow H_2SeO_4(aq)$$\nThe product responsible for the acidity is selenic acid, $H_2SeO_4$. This is an oxyacid because it contains hydrogen, oxygen, and another nonmetal (selenium).\n\nNow, let's analyze the student's proposed name, \"hydroselenic acid,\" and the standard nomenclature rules.\n\n**Flaw 1: Misidentification of the Acid Type and Application of an Incorrect Naming Convention**\n\nThe nomenclature system for acids distinguishes between two primary types: binary acids and oxyacids.\n\n*   **Binary acids** contain hydrogen and one other nonmetallic element. Their names follow the pattern: `hydro-` + (root of nonmetal) + `-ic acid`. For example, $HCl$ is hydrochloric acid, and $H_2S$ is hydrosulfuric acid. Following this rule, the name \"hydroselenic acid\" would correspond to the binary acid of selenium, which is hydrogen selenide dissolved in water, $H_2Se(aq)$.\n*   **Oxyacids** contain hydrogen, oxygen, and another nonmetal. Their names do not use the `hydro-` prefix. The names are based on the polyatomic anion they form, with the suffixes determined by the oxidation state of the central atom.\n\nThe student observed a reaction that forms the oxyacid $H_2SeO_4$ but applied the naming convention for a binary acid. The name \"hydroselenic acid\" refers to a completely different chemical compound, $H_2Se$. This is a major conceptual error.\n\n**Flaw 2: Incorrect Use of the \"hydro-\" Prefix**\n\nAs established by the rules above, the prefix \"hydro-\" is a specific flag used to indicate that the acid is a binary acid (containing only hydrogen and one other element). The product, $H_2SeO_4$, is an oxyacid, as it contains oxygen. Therefore, the use of the \"hydro-\" prefix is a direct violation of the naming rules for oxyacids.\n\n**Determining the Correct Name for the Product ($H_2SeO_4$)**\n\nTo correctly name $H_2SeO_4$, we must use the oxyacid rules.\n1.  Determine the oxidation state of the central atom, selenium (Se). In $H_2SeO_4$, hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1 and oxygen has an oxidation state of -2. Let the oxidation state of Se be $x$. The sum of oxidation states must be zero:\n    $$2(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0$$\n    $$2 + x - 8 = 0$$\n    $$x = +6$$\n2.  Compare this to other common oxidation states of selenium. Selenium, like sulfur in the same group, commonly forms oxyacids with oxidation states of +6 and +4.\n3.  The oxyacid with the central atom in the higher oxidation state takes the suffix \"-ic\". The oxyacid with the lower oxidation state takes the suffix \"-ous\".\n    *   $H_2SeO_4$ (Se is +6, higher state) is named **selenic acid**.\n    *   $H_2SeO_3$ (Se is +4, lower state) is named **selenous acid**.\n\nTherefore, the correct name for the product formed in the experiment is **selenic acid**.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A:** Incorrect. The product is not a binary acid, and the \"hydro-\" prefix rule is not limited to halogens ($H_2S$, hydrosulfuric acid, is a counterexample).\n*   **B:** Correct. This option accurately identifies both flaws. It correctly states that \"hydroselenic acid\" is the name for the binary acid $H_2Se$, while the reaction actually produces the oxyacid $H_2SeO_4$. It also correctly states that the \"hydro-\" prefix is exclusive to binary acids and is incorrect for an oxyacid.\n*   **C:** Incorrect. The oxidation state of Se in $H_2SeO_4$ is +6, not +4. The Stock system is not the standard way to name these common acids.\n*   **D:** Incorrect. The product is a molecular acid, not an ionic salt (though it ionizes in water). The reason for omitting \"hydro-\" is not redundancy but a specific rule to distinguish between acid types.\n*   **E:** Incorrect. The reaction is a synthesis (or combination) reaction, not a disproportionation. \"Aqueous selenium trioxide\" is a description, not the formal name of the acid product.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B provides the most accurate and complete explanation of the two fundamental flaws in the student's naming.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2007314"}]}
