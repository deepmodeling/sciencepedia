Aluminum sulfide", "solution": "The compound has formula $Al_{2}S_{3}$. For an ionic compound, the total charge must be zero. Let the oxidation number of aluminum be $x$ and sulfur be $-2$ (since sulfide is $S^{2-}$). Charge neutrality gives:\n$$2x + 3(-2) = 0 \\implies 2x - 6 = 0 \\implies x = 3.$$\nThus the cation is $Al^{3+}$ and the anion is $S^{2-}$, forming an ionic compound.\n\nNaming rules for ionic compounds:\n- The cation name is the element name: aluminum.\n- Roman numerals are used only when the metal can have multiple common oxidation states; aluminum has a fixed $+3$ state, so no Roman numeral is needed. Therefore, “aluminum(III)” is unnecessary.\n- The anion name is “sulfide” for $S^{2-}$.\n- Numeric prefixes like “di-” and “tri-” are not used for ionic compounds; they are for molecular (covalent) compounds.\n- “Sulfite” refers to the polyatomic ion $SO_{3}^{2-}$, which is not present here.\n\nTherefore, the correct name is aluminum sulfide, corresponding to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2008280"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basics, this problem introduces the naming convention for metals that can form multiple different cations, such as most transition metals.
