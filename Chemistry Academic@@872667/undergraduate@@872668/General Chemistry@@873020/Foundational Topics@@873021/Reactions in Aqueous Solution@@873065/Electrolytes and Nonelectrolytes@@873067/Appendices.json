To do this, several common chemical compounds are dissolved in separate beakers of pure water. An electrolyte is a substance that produces ions when dissolved in a solvent like water, thus making the solution electrically conductive.

When it dissolves in water, the glucose molecules disperse throughout the solvent, but they do not break apart into ions. This process can be represented as:\n    $$C_6H_{12}O_6(s) \\rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6(aq)$$\n    Since no ions are produced, glucose is classified as a nonelectrolyte. The resulting solution contains almost no mobile ions (except for the very few from the autoionization of water), and therefore, it will have the lowest electrical conductivity of the three.\n\n2.  **Sodium Nitrate ($NaNO_3$):**\n    Sodium nitrate is an ionic compound composed of the sodium cation ($Na^+$) and the nitrate anion ($NO_3^-$). As a soluble salt, it is a strong electrolyte, meaning it dissociates completely into its constituent ions when dissolved in water:\n    $$NaNO_3(s) \\rightarrow Na^+(aq) + NO_3^-(aq)$$\n    For each mole of $NaNO_3$ that dissolves, it produces two moles of ions: one mole of $Na^+$ and one mole of $NO_3^-$.

It dissociates completely in water to form a magnesium cation ($Mg^{2+}$) and two chloride anions ($Cl^-$):\n    $$MgCl_2(s) \\rightarrow Mg^{2+}(aq) + 2Cl^-(aq)$$\n    For each mole of $MgCl_2$ that dissolves, it produces three moles of ions: one mole of $Mg^{2+}$ and two moles of $Cl^-$. Therefore, a 0.1 M solution of $MgCl_2$ will have a total ion concentration of:\n    $$ \\text{Total ion concentration} = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\times (1 \\text{ ion } Mg^{2+} + 2 \\text{ ions } Cl^-) = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\times 3 = 0.3 \\, \\text{M}$$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy comparing the total concentration of ions in each 0.1 M solution, we have:\n-   Glucose: Negligible ion concentration ($\\approx 0$ M)\n-   Sodium Nitrate: Total ion concentration = 0.2 M\n-   Magnesium Chloride: Total ion concentration = 0.3 M\n\nSince electrical conductivity is proportional to the total ion concentration, the order of increasing conductivity is the same as the order of increasing total ion concentration:\nGlucose  Sodium Nitrate  Magnesium Chloride\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1991008"}, {"introduction": "Conductivity is a powerful tool for experimentally probing the degree of ionization.
