This is an acid-base reaction. Hydrobromic acid ($\\text{HBr}$) is a strong acid that donates a proton ($H^+$), and ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$) is a weak base that accepts the proton. The reactants are $\\text{NH}_3(aq)$ and $\\text{HBr}(aq)$. The ammonia molecule accepts a proton to form the ammonium ion, $\\text{NH}_4^+$. The remaining anion from the acid is the bromide ion, $Br^-$. These two ions combine to form the soluble salt ammonium bromide, $\\text{NH}_4\\text{Br}(aq)$. The balanced molecular equation is:\n$$\\text{NH}_3(aq) + \\text{HBr}(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{NH}_4\\text{Br}(aq)$$\n\nNext, we write the complete ionic equation. To do this, we represent all strong electrolytes (strong acids, strong bases, and soluble salts) as dissociated ions. Weak electrolytes and non-electrolytes are written in their molecular (or undissociated) form.\n- $\\text{NH}_3(aq)$ is a weak base, so it remains in its molecular form.\n- $\\text{HBr}(aq)$ is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates into $H^+(aq)$ and $Br^-(aq)$.\n- $\\text{NH}_4\\text{Br}(aq)$ is a soluble salt, so it completely dissociates into $\\text{NH}_4^+(aq)$ and $Br^-(aq)$.\nSubstituting these into the molecular equation gives the complete ionic equation:\n$$\\text{NH}_3(aq) + H^+(aq) + Br^-(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{NH}_4^+(aq) + Br^-(aq)$$\n\nFinally, we determine the net ionic equation. This is done by identifying and removing the spectator ions from the complete ionic equation. Spectator ions are those that appear unchanged on both the reactant and product sides of the equation. In this case, the bromide ion, $Br^-(aq)$, is present on both sides. After removing the spectator ion, we are left with the net ionic equation:\n$$\\text{NH}_3(aq) + H^+(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{NH}_4^+(aq)$$\nThis equation shows the actual chemical change: a molecule of ammonia reacts with a hydrogen ion to form an ammonium ion.\n\nComparing our derived set of equations with the given options:\n- Molecular: $\\text{NH}_3(aq) + \\text{HBr}(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{NH}_4\\text{Br}(aq)$\n- Complete Ionic: $\\text{NH}_3(aq) + H^+(aq) + Br^-(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{NH}_4^+(aq) + Br^-(aq)$\n- Net Ionic: $\\text{NH}_3(aq) + H^+(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{NH}_4^+(aq)$\n\nThis set matches the equations provided in option D.\n- Option A is incorrect because it fails to dissociate the strong acid $\\text{HBr}$ and the soluble salt $\\text{NH}_4\\text{Br}$ in the complete ionic equation.\n- Option B is incorrect because it uses the outdated and less accurate formulation of aqueous ammonia as $\\text{NH}_4\\text{OH}$, and then proceeds to treat it as a weak electrolyte.\n- Option C incorrectly writes the products of the molecular equation as separate ions.\n- Option E is incorrect because it does not dissociate the soluble product $\\text{NH}_4\\text{Br}$ in the complete ionic equation, leading to an incorrect net ionic equation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2028992"}, {"introduction": "The distinction between strong and weak electrolytes becomes quantitative when we consider their effect on a solution's physical properties.
