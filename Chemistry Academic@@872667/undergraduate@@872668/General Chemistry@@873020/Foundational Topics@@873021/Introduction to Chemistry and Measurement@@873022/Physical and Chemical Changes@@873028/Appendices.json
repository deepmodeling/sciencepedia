A chemical change produces new substances with different chemical compositions, as in oxidation, combustion, and pyrolysis.\n\nAnalyze each statement:\n\nI. The solid wax at the top of the candle transforms into a liquid pool. This is melting, a phase change. The hydrocarbon molecules $C_{n}H_{2n+2}$ remain chemically unchanged. Therefore, this is a physical change.\n\nII. The cotton wick becomes charred and black at the tip. This results from thermal decomposition (pyrolysis) and/or oxidation of cellulose, producing carbon (char) and other products. New substances form, so this is a chemical change.\n\nIII. The liquid wax is drawn up the wick and turns into a gas near the hot flame. Capillary action (transport) and vaporization (phase change) occur without altering the chemical identity of the wax molecules. Therefore, this is a physical change.\n\nIV. The gaseous wax reacts with oxygen from the air, producing a bright flame, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. This is combustion, a chemical reaction. For a general paraffin $C_{n}H_{2n+2}$, a balanced representation is:\n$$\nC_{n}H_{2n+2} + \\frac{3n+1}{2} O_{2} \\to n\\,CO_{2} + (n+1)\\,H_{2}O\n$$,\nwhich clearly forms new substances. Hence, this is a chemical change.\n\nV. Holding a cold glass in the plume yields tiny droplets of a clear liquid on the glass. This is condensation of water vapor to liquid water, a phase change. The substance remains $H_{2}O$, so this is a physical change.\n\nThus, the statements that describe physical changes are I, III, and V, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2012057"}, {"introduction": "Not all processes that release heat are chemical reactions, a common point of confusion when first learning this topic. This exercise explores the dramatic phenomenon of a supersaturated solution rapidly solidifying, a process that becomes noticeably warm. By analyzing this classic \"hot ice\" demonstration, you will learn to distinguish between exothermic chemical reactions and exothermic physical changes, such as crystallization. [@problem_id:2012051]", "problem": "A chemistry student prepares a solution by heating 80 grams of sodium acetate trihydrate ($CH_3COONa \\cdot 3H_2O$) in 10 milliliters of water until all the solid dissolves completely. The resulting clear solution is then allowed to cool undisturbed to room temperature. At this point, the solution is transparent with no solid present, despite containing a much higher concentration of sodium acetate than is normally soluble at room temperature. The student then initiates a change by dropping a single tiny crystal of solid sodium acetate into the solution. Immediately, a white solid rapidly grows from the seed crystal, converting the entire volume of the liquid into a solid mass within seconds. The student observes that the container becomes significantly warm to the touch during this rapid solidification.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best scientific explanation for these observations?\n\nA. A chemical reaction occurred, where the dissolved sodium acetate decomposed into new, more stable solid products, releasing energy as heat.\n\nB. A physical change occurred, where the excess dissolved sodium acetate solidified. This process is endothermic, absorbing energy from the surroundings, which is perceived as warmth.\n\nC. A physical change occurred, where the supersaturated solution underwent rapid crystallization. The process is exothermic, releasing the latent heat of fusion as the sodium acetate molecules organize into a solid lattice.\n\nD. A chemical change occurred, where the water and sodium acetate reacted to form a new hydrated compound that is solid at room temperature. The formation of new chemical bonds released heat.\n\nE. The solution was unstable due to being superheated, and adding the crystal caused it to rapidly boil, releasing steam and leaving behind the solid. The warmth is from the latent heat of vaporization.", "solution": "Heating increases solubility, so dissolving sodium acetate trihydrate at elevated temperature produces a clear solution with concentration $c$ greater than the equilibrium solubility $S(T)$ at room temperature. Upon cooling without nucleation, the solution remains supersaturated: $c > S(T_{\\text{room}})$. In this state, the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization is favorable, with the Gibbs free energy change for forming solid from a supersaturated solution satisfying $\\Delta G_{\\text{cryst}} < 0$ under the given conditions.\n\nHowever, supersaturated solutions are metastable due to a nucleation barrier. Classical nucleation considerations imply a positive free energy barrier $\\Delta G^{\\ast} > 0$ arising from interfacial energy, which prevents spontaneous crystallization in the absence of nuclei. Introducing a seed crystal provides a template that effectively lowers the nucleation barrier, initiating rapid crystal growth. This accounts for the immediate, volumetric solid formation observed upon adding a tiny crystal.\n\nThe observed warming of the container indicates that the process is exothermic, i.e., the enthalpy change for crystallization is negative: $\\Delta H_{\\text{cryst}} < 0$. As the solute molecules (or ions) organize into the crystalline lattice of sodium acetate trihydrate, the system releases heat (often termed the heat of crystallization; solidification generally releases the latent heat of fusion). This explains the noticeable temperature rise during rapid solidification.\n\nThese facts identify the process as a physical change (no new chemical species are formed; the composition corresponds to crystalline sodium acetate trihydrate) driven by supersaturation and nucleation, and exothermic due to lattice formation. Evaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because no chemical decomposition into new, more stable products occurs; the identity of the compound remains sodium acetate trihydrate.\n- B is incorrect because the process is not endothermic; the observed warming requires $\\Delta H < 0$.\n- C correctly describes a physical change, supersaturation-triggered rapid crystallization, and exothermic heat release upon lattice formation.\n- D is incorrect because it frames the event as a chemical reaction forming a new compound; crystallization of the hydrate from solution is a physical phase change.\n- E is incorrect because the phenomenon does not involve superheating or boiling; the transformation occurs at room temperature without steam.\n\nTherefore, the best scientific explanation is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2012051"}, {"introduction": "The distinction between physical and chemical changes is not just a matter of classification; it has quantitative and predictive power. Consider the slow transformation of a bronze statue as it develops a patina over decades—a clear chemical change. This problem demonstrates how you can use the measurable change in a system's total mass to calculate the precise amount of an original substance that has been chemically converted, connecting conceptual understanding to practical stoichiometry.

The statue is installed outdoors, where it is exposed to atmospheric gases. Over several decades, a distinctive green patina forms on its surface. A chemical analysis of the patina reveals that its primary component is the mineral malachite, which has the chemical formula $\\text{Cu}_2(\\text{OH})_2\\text{CO}_3$. The overall chemical reaction for the formation of this patina from the copper in the statue is given by:\n\n$$2 \\text{ Cu}(s) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(g) + \\text{CO}_2(g) + \\text{O}_2(g) \\rightarrow \\text{Cu}_2(\\text{OH})_2\\text{CO}_3(s)$$\n\nAfter thirty years, the statue is carefully weighed again, and its total mass is found to be 501.38 kg.

The overall mass of the solid object increases because the mass of the patina formed, $m_{patina}$, is greater than the mass of the copper consumed from the statue, $m_{Cu, reacted}$. The difference between these two masses must equal the mass of the atmospheric components added.\nTherefore, the change in mass of the statue can be expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta M = m_{patina} - m_{Cu, reacted} $$\n\nTo solve for $m_{Cu, reacted}$, we need to relate $m_{patina}$ to $m_{Cu, reacted}$ using stoichiometry.
