An extensive property is one that scales linearly with the size or amount of material in the system. An intensive property is one that is independent of the system's size or the amount of material.\n\nConsider a simplified quantum mechanical model for a conjugated polyene, which can be approximated as a single particle of mass $m$ confined to move freely within a one-dimensional box of length $L$. The quantized energy levels for this particle are given by the expression:\n$$E_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$$\nwhere $n$ is the principal quantum number ($n=1, 2, 3, ...$) and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n\nFor this system, let the length of the box, $L$, be considered the measure of the system's size.

Neither intensive nor extensive", "solution": "To determine whether the ground state energy of a particle in a one-dimensional box is an intensive or extensive property with respect to the box length $L$, we must analyze how the energy scales when the size of the system, $L$, is changed.\n\nFirst, let's formally define intensive and extensive properties in the context of a scaling factor, $\\lambda > 0$. Let $X$ be a physical property that depends on the system size, which we denote as $S$.\n- $X$ is **extensive** if scaling the system size by $\\lambda$ (i.e., $S \\to \\lambda S$) results in the property scaling by the same factor: $X(\\lambda S) = \\lambda X(S)$.\n- $X$ is **intensive** if scaling the system size by $\\lambda$ leaves the property unchanged: $X(\\lambda S) = X(S)$.\n\nIn our problem, the physical property is the ground state energy, $E_1$, and the measure of the system size is the length of the box, $L$. The ground state corresponds to the lowest energy level, which is for the principal quantum number $n=1$.\n\nThe expression for the ground state energy is:\n$$E_1(L) = \\frac{(1)^2 h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$$\nHere, we explicitly write $E_1$ as a function of $L$ to emphasize the dependency we are testing.\n\nNow, let's consider a new system where the size (length) is scaled by a factor $\\lambda$. The new length is $L' = \\lambda L$. We need to calculate the ground state energy for this new box, $E_1(L')$, and see how it relates to the original energy, $E_1(L)$.\n\nSubstituting $L' = \\lambda L$ into the energy expression:\n$$E_1(L') = E_1(\\lambda L) = \\frac{h^2}{8m(\\lambda L)^2}$$\n\nSimplifying the denominator:\n$$E_1(\\lambda L) = \\frac{h^2}{8m(\\lambda^2 L^2)} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} \\left( \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} \\right)$$\n\nRecognizing that the term in the parentheses is the original ground state energy, $E_1(L)$, we can write:\n$$E_1(\\lambda L) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} E_1(L)$$\n\nNow, we compare this result with the definitions of intensive and extensive properties:\n- For the energy to be extensive, we would need $E_1(\\lambda L) = \\lambda E_1(L)$. Our result is $\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} E_1(L)$, which is not equal to $\\lambda E_1(L)$ (for $\\lambda \\neq 1$).\n- For the energy to be intensive, we would need $E_1(\\lambda L) = E_1(L)$. Our result is $\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} E_1(L)$, which is not equal to $E_1(L)$ (for $\\lambda \\neq 1$).\n\nSince the ground state energy does not scale linearly with the length $L$ (extensive) nor is it independent of the length $L$ (intensive), it is classified as neither intensive nor extensive. The energy scales with the inverse square of the length, $E_1 \\propto L^{-2}$, a relationship that fits neither formal definition. The classification does not depend on the particle's mass $m$, as $m$ is simply a constant parameter in the scaling relationship.\n\nTherefore, the ground state energy of a particle in a 1D box is neither an intensive nor an extensive property with respect to the box length.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1998619"}]}
