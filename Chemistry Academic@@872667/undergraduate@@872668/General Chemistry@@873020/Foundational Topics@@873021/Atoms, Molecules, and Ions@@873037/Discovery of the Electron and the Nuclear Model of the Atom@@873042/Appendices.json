We can solve this by using the fundamental definitions of atomic structure.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Atomic Number (Z)**\n\nThe mass number, denoted by $A$, is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus. The number of protons is the atomic number, denoted by $Z$, which uniquely identifies a chemical element. The number of neutrons is denoted by $n$. The relationship is:\n$$A = Z + n$$\nWe are given that the mass number $A = 31$ and the number of neutrons $n = 16$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the atomic number $Z$:\n$$Z = A - n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$Z = 31 - 16 = 15$$\nThe atomic number of the ion is 15.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Element**\n\nThe atomic number ($Z$) determines the identity of the element. An element with an atomic number of 15 is Phosphorus (P). Therefore, the ion is an ion of phosphorus. This eliminates options B, C, and E, which list Sulfur or Silicon.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Number of Electrons**\n\nThe net charge of an ion is the difference between the number of protons (positive charges) and the number of electrons (negative charges). A neutral atom has an equal number of protons and electrons.\n$$\\text{Net Charge} = (\\text{Number of protons}) - (\\text{Number of electrons})$$\nLet $e^{-}$ be the number of electrons. The equation is:\n$$\\text{Net Charge} = Z - e^{-}$$\nWe are given that the net charge is $-2$. We have already calculated that the number of protons, $Z$, is 15. We can now solve for the number of electrons, $e^{-}$:\n$$-2 = 15 - e^{-}$$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $e^{-}$:\n$$e^{-} = 15 - (-2)$$\n$$e^{-} = 15 + 2$$\n$$e^{-} = 17$$\nSo, the ion has 17 electrons.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and Select the Correct Option**\n\nBased on our calculations, the element is Phosphorus ($Z=15$) and the ion has 17 electrons. We compare this result with the given choices:\n\nA. Phosphorus, 17 electrons - This matches our findings.\nB. Sulfur, 18 electrons - Incorrect element and electron count.\nC. Silicon, 16 electrons - Incorrect element and electron count.\nD. Phosphorus, 13 electrons - Correct element, but incorrect electron count. This would correspond to a $2+$ charge.\nE. Sulfur, 14 electrons - Incorrect element and electron count.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1990253"}, {"introduction": "While J.J.
