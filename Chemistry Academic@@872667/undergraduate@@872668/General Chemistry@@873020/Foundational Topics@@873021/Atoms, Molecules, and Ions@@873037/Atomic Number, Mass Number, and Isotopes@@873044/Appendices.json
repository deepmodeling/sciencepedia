The first species, which we will call Anion X, is a singly charged negative ion. It is formed from a parent neutral atom which has a mass number of 127. The second species is a neutral atom of the most abundant stable isotope of the noble gas Xenon (Xe), which has an atomic number of 54 and a mass number of 131. A key observation is that Anion X is isoelectronic with this neutral Xenon atom, meaning they both possess the identical number of electrons.\n\nBased on this information, determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons, respectively, in Anion X.", "solution": "Let the parent neutral atom of Anion X have atomic number $Z$ and mass number $A=127$. For a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons, so it has $Z$ electrons. Since Anion X is singly negatively charged, it has one additional electron compared to the neutral parent, hence its electron count is $Z+1$.\n\nAnion X is isoelectronic with neutral xenon. Neutral xenon has atomic number $54$, so it has $54$ electrons. Therefore, the electron count of Anion X satisfies\n$$\nZ+1=54 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad Z=53.\n$$\nThe number of protons in Anion X equals the atomic number of its nucleus, so the proton count is $53$.\n\nThe number of neutrons is given by the mass number minus the atomic number:\n$$\nN=A-Z=127-53=74.\n$$\nThe number of electrons in Anion X, from the isoelectronic condition, is\n$$\n54.\n$$\nThus, the numbers of protons, neutrons, and electrons in Anion X are $53$, $74$, and $54$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}53  74  54\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1978662"}, {"introduction": "Have you ever wondered why the atomic masses on the periodic table are rarely whole numbers?
