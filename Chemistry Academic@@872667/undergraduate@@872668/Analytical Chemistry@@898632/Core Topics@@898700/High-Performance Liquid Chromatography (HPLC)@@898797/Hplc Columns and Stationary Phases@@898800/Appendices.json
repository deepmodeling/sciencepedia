It is defined as:\n$$k = \\frac{t_R - t_M}{t_M}$$\nThe retention factor $k$ is a thermodynamic quantity that depends on the specific interactions between the analyte, the stationary phase, and the mobile phase at a given temperature. Crucially, it does not depend on the physical dimensions of the column (like its length) or the flow rate of the mobile phase. Therefore, $k$ is constant for both experiments.\n\nLet's calculate the retention factor $k$ from the first experiment:\n$$k = \\frac{12.5 \\text{ min} - 1.50 \\text{ min}}{1.50 \\text{ min}} = \\frac{11.0}{1.50} = \\frac{22}{3}$$\n\nNext, we must determine the new dead time, $t_{M,2}$, for the second experiment. The dead time is the time it takes for an unretained compound to travel the length of the column. It is given by the column length, $L$, divided by the linear velocity of the mobile phase, $u$:\n$$t_M = \\frac{L}{u}$$\nIn the second experiment, the new column length is $L_2 = 2L_1$. The problem states that the linear velocity, $u$, is kept constant. Therefore, the new dead time, $t_{M,2}$, is:\n$$t_{M,2} = \\frac{L_2}{u} = \\frac{2L_1}{u} = 2 \\left(\\frac{L_1}{u}\\right) = 2 t_{M,1}$$\nSo, the new dead time is simply twice the original dead time:\n$$t_{M,2} = 2 \\times 1.50 \\text{ min} = 3.00 \\text{ min}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the new retention time, $t_{R,2}$, using the new dead time, $t_{M,2}$, and the unchanged retention factor, $k$:\n$$t_{R,2} = t_{M,2} (1+k)$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$t_{R,2} = 3.00 \\text{ min} \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{22}{3}\\right) = 3.00 \\text{ min} \\times \\left(\\frac{3+22}{3}\\right) = 3.00 \\text{ min} \\times \\left(\\frac{25}{3}\\right) = 25.0 \\text{ min}$$\n\nAlternatively, we can derive a direct relationship between $t_{R,1}$ and $t_{R,2}$ symbolically.\nWe have $t_{R,2} = t_{M,2}(1+k)$ and $t_{M,2} = 2t_{M,1}$. Substituting these into the equation for $t_{R,2}$:\n$$t_{R,2} = (2t_{M,1}) (1+k) = 2 \\times [t_{M,1} (1+k)]$$\nSince $t_{R,1} = t_{M,1} (1+k)$, we can directly substitute to find:\n$$t_{R,2} = 2 t_{R,1}$$\nThis shows that if the linear velocity is held constant, doubling the column length will exactly double the retention time.\nUsing the initial retention time:\n$$t_{R,2} = 2 \\times 12.5 \\text{ min} = 25.0 \\text{ min}$$\n\nThus, the expected new retention time is 25.0 minutes, which corresponds to option D.\n- Option A (17.7 min) would result from incorrectly assuming retention time scales with the square root of the length ($12.5 \\times \\sqrt{2}$), a property related to resolution, not retention time.\n- Option C (23.5 min) would result from incorrectly doubling the adjusted retention time ($t_R-t_M$) but failing to add the new, doubled dead time ($2 \\times (12.5 - 1.5) + 1.5 = 23.5$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1445237"}, {"introduction": "Once you understand the basics of retention, the next goal is to optimize the separation by improving resolution.

The separation is performed on a standard C18 packed column with a length $L = 15.0$ cm and an internal diameter $d = 4.6$ mm. The column packing has a total porosity $\\epsilon_{\\text{total}} = 0.65$. The analysis is run under isocratic conditions with a constant mobile phase flow rate of $F = 1.00$ mL/min.

This creates a \"fast track\" path for a portion of the injected analyte. We can model this situation by assuming that a fraction of the analyte molecules effectively bypasses the stationary phase over a length $L_{\\text{void}}$ at the inlet, while the remaining analyte interacts with the stationary phase over the full column length $L$. For both populations of molecules, assume the transit time through the mobile phase is determined by the total column volume and flow rate.

We are given a model to account for this phenomenon.\n\nFirst, let's establish the fundamental relationship for retention time, $t_R$, in chromatography:\n$t_R = t_M (1+k)$\nwhere $t_M$ is the column dead time (the time it takes for an unretained species to pass through the column) and $k$ is the retention factor. The retention factor is defined as the ratio of time the analyte spends in the stationary phase ($t_S$) to the time it spends in the mobile phase ($t_M$), so $k = t_S/t_M$. This means $t_S = k \\cdot t_M$, and the total retention time can be written as the sum of time in the mobile phase and time in the stationary phase: $t_R = t_M + t_S = t_M + k \\cdot t_M$.\n\nAccording to the proposed model, the injected analyte splits into two populations giving two peaks.\n\nFor the \"normal\" population, the analyte interacts with the stationary phase along the entire column length $L$. Its retention time, $t_{R, \\text{normal}}$, is given by the standard equation:\n$t_{R, \\text{normal}} = t_M (1+k)$\n\nFor the \"fast track\" population, the analyte travels through the mobile phase for the entire column length, so its time in the mobile phase is still $t_M$. However, it only interacts with the stationary phase over an effective length of $(L - L_{\\text{void}})$. Since the time spent in the stationary phase, $t_S$, is proportional to the amount of stationary phase encountered, which is proportional to the packed length, the time in the stationary phase for this population, $t_{S, \\text{fast}}$, is reduced by a factor of $(L - L_{\\text{void}})/L$.\n$t_{S, \\text{fast}} = t_S \\cdot \\frac{L - L_{\\text{void}}}{L} = (k \\cdot t_M) \\frac{L - L_{\\text{void}}}{L}$\nThe retention time for the fast-track population, $t_{R, \\text{fast}}$, is the sum of its time in the mobile phase and its reduced time in the stationary phase:\n$t_{R, \\text{fast}} = t_M + t_{S, \\text{fast}} = t_M + k \\cdot t_M \\frac{L - L_{\\text{void}}}{L} = t_M \\left(1 + k \\frac{L - L_{\\text{void}}}{L}\\right)$\n\nThe observed time separation between the two peak maxima, $\\Delta t_R$, is the difference between these two retention times:\n$\\Delta t_R = t_{R, \\text{normal}} - t_{R, \\text{fast}}$\n$\\Delta t_R = t_M(1+k) - t_M \\left(1 + k \\frac{L - L_{\\text{void}}}{L}\\right)$\n$\\Delta t_R = t_M \\left[ (1+k) - \\left(1 + k\\left(1 - \\frac{L_{\\text{void}}}{L}\\right)\\right) \\right]$\n$\\Delta t_R = t_M \\left[ 1+k - 1 - k + k\\frac{L_{\\text{void}}}{L} \\right]$\n$\\Delta t_R = t_M \\cdot k \\cdot \\frac{L_{\\text{void}}}{L}$\n\nWe need to solve for $L_{\\text{void}}$:\n$L_{\\text{void}} = \\frac{\\Delta t_R \\cdot L}{k \\cdot t_M}$\n\nTo use this equation, we first need to calculate the column dead time, $t_M$.
