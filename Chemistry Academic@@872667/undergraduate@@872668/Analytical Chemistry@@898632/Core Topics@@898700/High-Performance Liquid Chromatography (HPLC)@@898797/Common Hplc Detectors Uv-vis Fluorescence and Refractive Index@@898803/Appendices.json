For small signals in the linear regime, the concentration limit of detection scales as\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{LOD}} \\propto \\frac{\\sigma_{n}}{m},\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope of the signal versus concentration and $\\sigma_{n}$ is the standard deviation of the noise. A smaller $c_{\\mathrm{LOD}}$ implies higher sensitivity.\n\nUV-Vis absorbance detector: In the linear regime, Beer–Lambert law gives\n$$\nA=\\epsilon b c,\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity, $b$ is the path length, and $c$ is concentration. Thus the slope is $m_{\\mathrm{UV}}=\\epsilon b$. UV-Vis detectors have moderate baseline noise and moderate selectivity, yielding moderate sensitivity.\n\nFluorescence detector: In the linear, unsaturated regime, the fluorescence signal is proportional to the absorbed light times the quantum yield:\n$$\nF = k \\,\\phi\\, \\epsilon b \\, c,\n$$\nwhere $k$ is an instrumental constant depending on excitation intensity and collection efficiency, and $\\phi$ is the fluorescence quantum yield. The slope is $m_{\\mathrm{FL}}=k \\phi \\epsilon b$. Because fluorescence detection is highly selective (emission is measured at a different wavelength than excitation) and backgrounds are typically low, $\\sigma_{n}$ is small, and $m_{\\mathrm{FL}}$ is often effectively larger than $m_{\\mathrm{UV}}$. Consequently $c_{\\mathrm{LOD}}$ is typically much smaller than for UV-Vis, giving higher sensitivity than UV-Vis for analytes that fluoresce.\n\nRefractive index (RI) detector: The RI signal is proportional to the difference in refractive index between the eluent at the analyte zone and the pure mobile phase. For dilute solutions,\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{RI}} \\propto \\Delta n \\approx \\left(\\frac{dn}{dc}\\right) c,\n$$\nso the slope is $m_{\\mathrm{RI}} \\propto \\frac{dn}{dc}$. RI detectors are universal but suffer from relatively high noise and baseline drift due to sensitivity to temperature, pressure, and composition fluctuations; they also cannot be used effectively with gradient elution. As a result, $c_{\\mathrm{LOD}}$ is relatively large, implying the lowest sensitivity among the three.\n\nComparison: Given analytes detectable by all three detectors, the general sensitivity trend is\n$$\n\\text{RI (least sensitive)}  \\text{UV-Vis (moderate)}  \\text{Fluorescence (most sensitive)}.\n$$\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1431777"}, {"introduction": "After comparing general detector characteristics, it's useful to explore their unique operational principles.
