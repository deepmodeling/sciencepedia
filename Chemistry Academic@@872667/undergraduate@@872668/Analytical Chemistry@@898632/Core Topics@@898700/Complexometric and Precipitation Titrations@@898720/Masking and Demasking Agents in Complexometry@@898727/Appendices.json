The sample is known to contain a significant concentration of interfering zinc ions ($Zn^{2+}$). To perform the analysis, the chemist opts for a complexometric titration using a standardized solution of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).\n\nThe procedure is as follows: A known volume of the wastewater sample is taken, and a buffer is added to maintain the pH at 10.0. To prevent zinc from interfering, potassium cyanide (KCN) is added as a masking agent. Finally, a small amount of Eriochrome Black T (EBT) is added as the indicator.

The tetracyanozincate(II) complex, $[Zn(CN)_4]^{2-}$, which forms upon adding the masking agent, is intensely colored, and its color obscures the subtle color change of the EBT indicator at the endpoint.\n\nB. In the alkaline solution (pH 10), cyanide ions can act as a reducing agent or participate in reactions that lead to the irreversible chemical degradation of the EBT indicator molecule, which is an azo dye.\n\nC. The cyanide ion, being the conjugate base of a weak acid, hydrolyzes to increase the solution's pH beyond the effective range of the buffer, pushing the EBT indicator into its orange-colored form (its state above pH 11.5).\n\nD. Cyanide is such an effective ligand that it forms a highly stable complex with magnesium ions, $[Mg(CN)_4]^{2-}$, which is more stable than the Mg-EDTA complex, thus preventing the titration reaction from proceeding.\n\nE.

At $pH \\approx 10$, EBT (denote the indicator base form as $In^{2-}$) forms a wine-red metal–indicator complex with magnesium:\n$$\nMg^{2+} + In^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons MgIn^{-} \\quad \\text{(wine-red)}\n$$\nDuring titration, EDTA (denote the fully deprotonated ligand as $Y^{4-}$) complexes $Mg^{2+}$ strongly:\n$$\nMg^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons MgY^{2-}\n$$\nAt the endpoint, $Mg^{2+}$ is sequestered by EDTA, the metal–indicator complex dissociates, and the free indicator exhibits the sky-blue color. If the indicator is chemically destroyed or otherwise rendered inactive by a reagent present (here, $CN^{-}$), the characteristic color change is lost, which is observed as “indicator poisoning.”\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\nA. The color of $[Zn(CN)_{4}]^{2-}$ obscures the indicator endpoint. The complexation of zinc by cyanide is\n$$\nZn^{2+} + 4CN^{-} \\rightleftharpoons [Zn(CN)_{4}]^{2-}.\n$$\nZinc(II) is $d^{10}$; its cyanide complexes are typically colorless because $d$–$d$ transitions are not operative and there is no intense charge-transfer absorption in the visible for this closed-shell system. Therefore, there is no intense color from $[Zn(CN)_{4}]^{2-}$ to mask the EBT color change. Option A is incorrect.\n\nB. Cyanide causes irreversible chemical degradation of EBT (an azo dye) in alkaline solution. EBT is an azo dye with an extended conjugated system responsible for its color. Under alkaline conditions, $CN^{-}$ is a good nucleophile and can participate in reactions that attack the azo chromophore or related activated sites, leading to cleavage or structural modification that destroys the conjugation. Such reactions irreversibly bleach or alter azo dyes, a phenomenon commonly described as “indicator poisoning.” Hence, in the presence of cyanide at $pH \\approx 10$, EBT can be chemically degraded and fail to function, matching the observed poor or absent endpoint. Option B provides a chemically accurate reason.\n\nC. Cyanide hydrolysis overwhelms the buffer and raises $pH$ beyond the EBT range. The hydrolysis equilibrium is\n$$\nCN^{-} + H_{2}O \\rightleftharpoons HCN + OH^{-}, \\quad K_{b}=\\frac{K_{w}}{K_{a}(\\text{HCN})}.\n$$\nAlthough $CN^{-}$ is the conjugate base of a weak acid and can raise $pH$, the procedure specifies that a buffer is added to maintain $pH=10.0$. A properly prepared buffer at $pH=10$ has sufficient capacity to resist modest additions of $CN^{-}$. It is therefore unlikely that the buffer is driven beyond the effective range to $pH>11.5$ so as to force EBT into a different color form as the dominant cause of endpoint failure. Option C is not the most accurate explanation.\n\nD. Cyanide forms $[Mg(CN)_{4}]^{2-}$ more stable than Mg–EDTA, preventing titration. Magnesium is a hard Lewis acid, whereas $CN^{-}$ is a borderline/softer base; by HSAB considerations, $Mg^{2+}$ does not form highly stable cyanide complexes. In contrast, EDTA is a hexadentate hard-base ligand and forms a much more stable chelate with $Mg^{2+}$. Qualitatively,\n$$\nK_{f}(\\text{MgY}^{2-}) \\gg K_{f}(\\text{Mg–CN complexes}),\n$$\nso EDTA effectively displaces any weakly bound $CN^{-}$. Thus cyanide does not outcompete EDTA for $Mg^{2+}$, and Option D is incorrect.\n\nE. EDTA is consumed by forming covalent bonds with cyanide. EDTA is a polyaminocarboxylate ligand that complexes metal cations; it does not undergo covalent capture of $CN^{-}$ under these conditions. There is no plausible pathway whereby EDTA is “consumed” by cyanide anions. Option E is incorrect.\n\nOnly Option B accurately reflects the known chemical behavior: cyanide in alkaline solution can chemically degrade azo dye indicators like EBT, causing indicator poisoning and loss of the characteristic endpoint color change.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1456164"}, {"introduction": "The feasibility of selectively titrating one metal ion in the presence of another can be quantitatively predicted using conditional formation constants.
