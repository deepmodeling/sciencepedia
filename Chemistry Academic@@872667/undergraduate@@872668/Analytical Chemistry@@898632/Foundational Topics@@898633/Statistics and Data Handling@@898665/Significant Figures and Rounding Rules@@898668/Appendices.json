The key to this problem is the correct application of the rules for significant figures during calculations involving addition and division.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total mass of the solution. The total mass is the sum of the mass of the solute (NaCl) and the mass of the solvent (water).\n$$ m_{\\text{total}} = m_{\\text{NaCl}} + m_{\\text{water}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ m_{\\text{total}} = 12.4 \\text{ g} + 375.18 \\text{ g} = 387.58 \\text{ g} $$\n\nWhen adding or subtracting measured quantities, the result must be rounded to the same number of decimal places as the measurement with the fewest decimal places.\n- The mass of NaCl, $12.4$ g, has one decimal place.\n- The mass of water, $375.18$ g, has two decimal places.\nTherefore, the sum must be rounded to one decimal place. The unrounded sum is $387.58$ g. Rounding this to one decimal place gives $387.6$ g. This rounded mass has four significant figures. This step determines the number of significant figures for the mass in the subsequent density calculation.\n\nNext, we calculate the density ($\\rho$) of the solution. Density is defined as mass per unit volume.\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{m_{\\text{total}}}{V_{\\text{solution}}} $$\nIt is best practice to use the unrounded value for the mass in the intermediate calculation and then apply the significant figure rules at the final step. The number of significant figures in our mass is four (from $387.6$ g), and the number of significant figures in our volume, $381.5$ mL, is also four.\n\nWhen multiplying or dividing measured quantities, the result must be rounded to the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest significant figures.\n- Total mass ($m_{\\text{total}}$) has 4 significant figures.\n- Solution volume ($V_{\\text{solution}}$) has 4 significant figures.\nTherefore, the final answer for the density must be rounded to four significant figures.\n\nLet's perform the division using the unrounded mass for better accuracy before the final rounding:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{387.58 \\text{ g}}{381.5 \\text{ mL}} \\approx 1.01593709... \\text{ g/mL} $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $1.016$.\n\nTherefore, the density of the saline solution, reported to the correct number of significant figures, is $1.016$ g/mL.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.016}$$", "id": "1472262"}, {"introduction": "This practice simulates a common and critical procedure in analytical chemistry: preparing a standard solution through serial dilution.
