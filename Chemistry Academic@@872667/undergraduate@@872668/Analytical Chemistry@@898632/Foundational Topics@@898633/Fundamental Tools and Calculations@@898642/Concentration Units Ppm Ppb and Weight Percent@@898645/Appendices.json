The calculation involves several steps: determining the moles of acid used in the titration, relating this to the equivalent moles of CaCO₃, calculating the mass of these CaCO₃ equivalents, finding the mass of the wastewater sample, and finally computing the mass ratio to find ppm.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of the titrant, sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), used in the titration. The volume of the acid is given as $V_{acid} = 21.35$ mL, and its molarity is $M_{acid} = 0.01850$ M (or mol/L).
