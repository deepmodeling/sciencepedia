This practice connects the balance's specified performance to a critical practical question: what is the smallest amount of substance you can weigh while maintaining a required level of accuracy?

This chapter specifies a criterion for the minimum weighable quantity on an analytical balance. The rule states that a weighing is acceptable only if twice the repeatability standard deviation of the balance, $s$, divided by the nominal mass being weighed, $m$, does not exceed a specified relative tolerance, $T$.

The criterion is given by the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{2s}{m} \\le T\n$$\nwhere $s$ is the repeatability standard deviation, $m$ is the mass being weighed, and $T$ is the allowed relative tolerance.\n\nThe minimum weighable quantity, $m_{min}$, is the smallest mass that satisfies this condition. This occurs at the limit where the expression equals the tolerance:\n$$\n\\frac{2s}{m_{min}} = T\n$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $m_{min}$:\n$$\nm_{min} = \\frac{2s}{T}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Repeatability standard deviation, $s = 0.00015$ g.\n- Relative tolerance, $T = 0.10\\%$.\n\nWe must first convert the tolerance from a percentage to a decimal fraction:\n$$\nT = 0.10\\% = \\frac{0.10}{100} = 0.0010\n$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of $s$ and $T$ into the equation for $m_{min}$:\n$$\nm_{min} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.00015 \\text{ g}}{0.0010} = \\frac{0.00030 \\text{ g}}{0.0010} = 0.30 \\text{ g}\n$$\nThis is the minimum mass of $KMnO_4$ that can be weighed to be compliant with the guideline.\n\nNext, we need to find the volume of the solution that requires this minimum mass of solute. The relationship between the mass of a solute ($m$), the concentration of the solution ($C$), the volume of the solution ($V$), and the molar mass of the solute ($M$) is:\n$$\nm = C \\times V \\times M\n$$\n\nTo find the minimum volume, $V_{min}$, that can be prepared, we set the required mass $m$ equal to the minimum weighable quantity $m_{min}$:\n$$\nm_{min} = C \\times V_{min} \\times M\n$$\n\nWe can now solve for $V_{min}$:\n$$\nV_{min} = \\frac{m_{min}}{C \\times M}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Target concentration, $C = 0.02000$ mol/L.\n- Molar mass of $KMnO_4$, $M = 158.034$ g/mol.\n- We have calculated $m_{min} = 0.30$ g.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $V_{min}$:\n$$\nV_{min} = \\frac{0.30 \\text{ g}}{(0.02000 \\text{ mol/L}) \\times (158.034 \\text{ g/mol})}\n$$\n\n$$\nV_{min} = \\frac{0.30 \\text{ g}}{3.16068 \\text{ g/L}} \\approx 0.094916 \\text{ L}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer in milliliters (mL).

The optimal approach in metrology is to proceed from the simplest, least invasive, and highest-likelihood external causes toward more time-consuming diagnostics and finally to service intervention. The key physical principle is that the balance reading reflects all forces acting on the pan, not just gravity on the mass. If the net force sensed by the transducer is written as\n$$\nF_{\\text{sensor}}(t) = m g + \\Delta F(t),\n$$\nthen the indicated mass is\n$$\nm_{\\text{read}}(t) = \\frac{F_{\\text{sensor}}(t)}{g} = m + \\frac{\\Delta F(t)}{g}.\n$$\nAny time-dependent disturbance $\\Delta F(t)$ will appear as drift. Principal contributors include:\n- Airflow and buoyancy: drafts and temperature gradients vary $\\rho_{\\text{air}}$ and convection, so the buoyant force $F_{\\text{buoy}} = \\rho_{\\text{air}} V g$ and dynamic pressure change with time, affecting $m_{\\text{read}}(t)$.\n- Electrostatics: charges on objects near the pan produce electrostatic forces; by Coulomb’s law a representative contribution scales as $F_{\\text{elec}} \\propto \\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}$, modulated by geometry. These can cause drift if charges accumulate or dissipate.\n- Vibrations: time-varying inertial forces couple into the load cell, perturbing $F_{\\text{sensor}}(t)$.\n- Level and mechanical alignment: misleveling changes how the gravitational vector projects onto the weighing axis, degrading repeatability and sensitivity; it also makes the system more responsive to vibrations.\n- Contamination and sorption: residues can adsorb or desorb moisture, or carry static, making $m(t)$ effectively time dependent.\n\nThe logbook provides evidence that environment plays a significant role: Wednesday notes strong HVAC with high and jumpy readings, Thursday shows improvement after internal calibration, and Friday shows a slow upward drift over roughly ninety seconds, typical of environmental and electrostatic effects. Therefore, a rational troubleshooting sequence is:\n1) Address simple, non-invasive external causes first, especially those likely implicated by the log (cleanliness and static, level and vibration, drafts and temperature gradients).\n2) Once setup and environment are controlled, perform diagnostic testing (linearity) to assess balance performance across range.\n3) If problems persist after these controls and diagnostics, escalate to service.\n\nMapping this to the options:\n\n- Step 4 (clean with anti-static tools) is a quick, non-invasive intervention that directly reduces electrostatic forces and removes residues that can cause drift $m(t)$. It complements environmental control and is often done immediately before or alongside leveling.\n- Step 1 (verify level and table stability) ensures proper mechanical alignment and minimizes sensitivity to vibrations; it is a foundational setup step and should precede deeper diagnostics.\n- Step 3 (mitigate environmental factors: drafts, static, temperature gradients) directly targets $\\Delta F(t)$ sources evidenced in the log (HVAC, instability).\n- Step 5 (comprehensive linearity test) is only meaningful after environmental and setup factors are controlled; otherwise, results are confounded by $\\Delta F(t)$.\n- Step 2 (contact service) should be reserved for cases where, after controlling environment, leveling, cleaning, and passing/failing formal tests, the balance still misbehaves.\n\nAmong the provided sequences:\n- A and E contact service too early, before basic controls and diagnostics.\n- D begins with a linearity test before addressing environment and setup, which is inefficient and potentially misleading.\n- C addresses environment then level and clean, but contacts service before performing a linearity test, which is premature.\n\nOption B, which sequences 4 → 1 → 3 → 5 → 2, follows the preferred logic: quick cleaning and static mitigation, foundational setup checks, targeted environmental controls, then diagnostic testing, and finally escalation if needed. Although many practitioners might swap steps 3 and 4, option B remains the most coherent and efficient among those offered, especially given the noted drift and HVAC sensitivity where anti-static cleaning is directly relevant.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and efficient order is represented by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1459105"}]}
