The consistency of the concentration across these standards is critical for the validity of the experiment. The chemist decides to calibrate two different 25-mL Class A volumetric pipettes, labeled Pipette A and Pipette B, to select the one with the highest precision.\n\nThe calibration is performed by weighing the mass of deionized water delivered by each pipette in five replicate measurements. The experiment is conducted in a temperature-controlled room at 23.0 °C, where the density of water is known to be 0.99754 g/mL.

Precision refers to the reproducibility of a measurement, or the closeness of a series of measurements to each other. It is quantitatively assessed by statistical measures of dispersion, such as the standard deviation. A smaller standard deviation indicates higher precision. Accuracy, on the other hand, refers to the closeness of the average measurement to the true or accepted value.\n\nFirst, we must convert the measured masses of water into the corresponding volumes delivered by each pipette, using the given density of water, $\\rho = 0.99754$ g/mL.

The mean volume for Pipette B (25.0115 mL) deviates by $|25.0115 - 25.00| = 0.0115$ mL. Therefore, Pipette B is more accurate.\n\nThe problem states that consistency is critical, which directly corresponds to precision. The analyst needs to choose the pipette with the highest precision, which is the one with the smallest standard deviation. That is Pipette A.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Pipette A, because its mean delivered volume is closer to the nominal 25.00 mL. This is incorrect reasoning. Mean volume relates to accuracy, not precision, and Pipette B is actually more accurate.\nB. Pipette B, because its mean delivered volume is closer to the nominal 25.00 mL. This correctly identifies Pipette B as more accurate but incorrectly suggests choosing it for a task requiring high precision.\nC. Pipette A, because the standard deviation of its delivered volumes is smaller. This is the correct choice. A smaller standard deviation indicates higher precision (better consistency), which is the primary requirement.\nD. Pipette B, because the standard deviation of its delivered volumes is larger. This is incorrect. A larger standard deviation means lower precision.\nE. Both pipettes are equally suitable. This is incorrect as the statistical analysis shows a clear difference in precision.\n\nTherefore, the chemist must choose Pipette A due to its smaller standard deviation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1470072"}, {"introduction": "Gravimetric calibration is a fundamental technique for determining the true volume of glassware.
