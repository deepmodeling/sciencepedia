The Gas Chromatograph (GC) is equipped with a standard non-polar column (e.g., DB-5), which primarily separates compounds based on their boiling points. The analysis of the sample extract produces a chromatogram with two distinct peaks at retention times of 6.8 minutes and 10.3 minutes.\n\nPreliminary tests suggest that the two pollutants are n-hexane ($C_6H_{14}$) and 1-pentanol ($C_5H_{12}O$).
