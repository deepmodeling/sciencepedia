The marketing department claims the product contains 20% cashews by weight, but the production team is concerned about the uniformity of the mix. A non-uniform distribution, known as heterogeneity, can lead to customer dissatisfaction even if the overall batch composition is correct.\n\nTo quantify this heterogeneity, you take a series of small samples, called increments, from a large 1.00 kg container of the mixed nuts. You collect five separate increments, each having a mass of precisely 50.0 g. For each increment, you meticulously separate the cashews from the other nuts and weigh them. The masses of the cashews isolated from each of the five increments are recorded as follows:\n- Increment 1: 11.2 g\n- Increment 2: 9.8 g\n- Increment 3: 10.5 g\n- Increment 4: 8.9 g\n- Increment 5: 11.6 g\n\nA key industrial metric for characterizing the variability arising from product heterogeneity is the sample standard deviation of the mass of the component of interest (in this case, cashews) across the collected increments.

The field consists of two distinct soil zones: Zone L, a 20-hectare area of loam, and Zone C, a 30-hectare area of clay. It is known from prior studies that the variability of chemical concentrations differs between the two zones. A pilot study provided the following estimates for the standard deviations of the herbicide concentration:\n- Standard deviation in Zone L: $s_L = 0.60$ mg/kg\n- Standard deviation in Zone C: $s_C = 1.10$ mg/kg\n\nThe chemist decides to use a stratified sampling strategy to account for the soil heterogeneity. A total of 90 samples will be collected. To maximize the precision of the estimate for the overall mean concentration, the chemist will use optimal allocation (also known as Neyman allocation). In this scheme, the number of samples collected from each stratum (zone) is made proportional to the product of the stratum's relative area and its standard deviation.\n\nGiven a total of 90 samples, how many samples should be collected from Zone C to adhere to the an optimal allocation plan?
