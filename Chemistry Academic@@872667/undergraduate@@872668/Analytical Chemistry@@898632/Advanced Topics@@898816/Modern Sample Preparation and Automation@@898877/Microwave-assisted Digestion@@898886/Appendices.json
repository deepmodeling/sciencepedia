The process involves heating a sample with concentrated acids (e.g., nitric acid) in a sealed vessel using microwave energy. This method achieves temperatures and pressures significantly higher than those attainable by heating on a conventional hot plate, leading to much faster and more complete digestion.\n\nA student in an introductory analytical chemistry lab is tasked with digesting a dried plant tissue sample.

The key engineering controls are high chemical resistance and the ability to tolerate substantial internal pressure and rapid thermal ramps without catastrophic failure. A standard borosilicate beaker does not meet these requirements, making the proposal unsafe or impractical for the following reasons.\n\nEvaluate each statement:\n\nA. Correct. In microwave digestion, the target conditions involve elevated temperature and the concomitant buildup of vapor pressure within a sealed vessel. Standard borosilicate beakers are not designed as pressure vessels and have no rated pressure tolerance or engineered sealing. If the beaker is sealed or partially sealed (for example, with a cover or an improvised cap) to emulate digestion conditions, volatile acids and decomposition gases will raise the internal pressure. Because the beaker is not designed to withstand such pressure, it poses a significant explosion hazard. If left open to avoid pressure, the digestion will be impractical because it cannot reach the requisite elevated temperatures at ambient pressure, but the safety rationale in A (pressure hazard) correctly identifies a primary reason in the sealed-vessel context intrinsic to microwave digestion.\n\nB. Incorrect. Borosilicate glass is generally resistant to nitric acid, even at elevated temperatures typical of digestion, over the timescales used in sample prep. Significant attack of glass requires hydrofluoric acid or fluoride-containing media, which are not specified here (the exemplar acid given is nitric acid). While trace leaching of elements such as Na, B, or Si can occur, it is not a primary cause of vessel failure or a dominant contamination route in this specific nitric-acid scenario, and thus is not a primary reason the proposal is fundamentally unsafe or impractical.\n\nC. Incorrect. Borosilicate glass is largely transparent (not opaque) to microwave radiation at the frequencies used in laboratory microwave systems. Microwaves pass through the glass and couple primarily to polar solvents and ionic species in the sample, enabling heating. Therefore, opacity of the beaker is not a valid reason.\n\nD. Correct. Microwave heating can be rapid and spatially non-uniform due to field distributions and differential coupling to the sample versus the vessel. This can create steep thermal gradients. Even though borosilicate has relatively low thermal expansion and decent thermal shock resistance, the extreme ramp rates and hot spots used in digestion can impose substantial thermal stresses that exceed the beaker’s mechanical limits, leading to cracking or shattering. This is a legitimate safety concern in the high-temperature, fast-heating digestion environment.\n\nE. Incorrect. Borosilicate glass is a dielectric and remains an electrical insulator at digestion temperatures; it does not become sufficiently conductive to initiate electrical arcing. Arcing in microwave cavities is typically associated with metals, sharp conductive edges, or ionized gases, not the intrinsic conductivity of hot glass.\n\nTherefore, the primary correct reasons are A and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "1457630"}, {"introduction": "The high pressures generated during microwave digestion are not just a qualitative concern; they are a quantifiable reality governed by stoichiometry and gas laws.
