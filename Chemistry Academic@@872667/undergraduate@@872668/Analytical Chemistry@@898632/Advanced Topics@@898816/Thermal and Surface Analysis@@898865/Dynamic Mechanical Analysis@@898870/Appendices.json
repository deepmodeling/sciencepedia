In the experiment, a rectangular sample of the polymer is subjected to a small, oscillating sinusoidal strain at a fixed frequency. The temperature of the sample is slowly ramped up from a low temperature, where the polymer is rigid and glassy, to a high temperature, where it becomes soft and rubbery.\n\nThe instrument records two primary variables as a function of temperature:\n- **Variable M1**: This variable is defined as the component of the resulting stress that is perfectly in-phase with the applied strain, divided by the strain amplitude. Physically, it relates to the elastic character and stiffness of the material.\n- **Variable M2**: This variable is defined as the component of the resulting stress that is 90 degrees out-of-phase with the applied strain, divided by the strain amplitude. Physically, it relates to the viscous character and energy-dissipating properties of the material.\n\nThe experimental data shows the following behavior for the two variables across the temperature scan:\n- At low temperatures, Variable M1 has a high, stable value. As the temperature increases through a narrow, characteristic range, the value of M1 drops sharply by several orders of magnitude. At temperatures above this range, M1 remains at a new, much lower stable value.\n- At low temperatures, Variable M2 has a very low value. As the temperature enters the same characteristic range where M1 drops, Variable M2 rises to a distinct peak and then decreases as the temperature is further increased.\n\nBased on these definitions and observed behaviors, identify Variable M1 and Variable M2.\n\nA.

The experiment is conducted in tensile mode, where the film is clamped at both ends and subjected to a sinusoidal tensile strain at a fixed frequency while the temperature is ramped upwards at a constant rate.\n\nFrom literature data, the student expects to see a storage modulus ($E'$) in the glassy region (at temperatures well below $T_g$) of approximately 3.0 GPa, followed by a sharp drop of several orders of magnitude around the $T_g$. Concurrently, the loss tangent, $\\tan\\delta = E''/E'$ (where $E''$ is the loss modulus), is expected to show a relatively sharp and well-defined peak, with the peak maximum corresponding to the $T_g$ of PMMA (around 105 °C).\n\nHowever, the experimental results are anomalous.
