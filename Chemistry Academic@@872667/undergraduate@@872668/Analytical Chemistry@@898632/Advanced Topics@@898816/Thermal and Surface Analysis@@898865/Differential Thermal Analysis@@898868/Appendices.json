In the experiment, a small amount of the compound (the sample) and an equal mass of a thermally inert reference material (e.g., alumina, $\\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3$) are placed in a furnace and heated at a constant, controlled rate. The instrument records the temperature difference, $\\Delta T = T_{\\text{sample}} - T_{\\text{reference}}$, as a function of the furnace temperature, $T$.\n\nThe resulting DTA thermogram shows the following features:\n1.  Starting from room temperature, $\\Delta T$ remains close to zero.\n2.  At a furnace temperature of $T_1$, the trace exhibits a sharp, negative dip, after which it returns to the baseline value of near zero.\n3.

Under identical furnace heating, this extra absorption causes the sample to lag in temperature relative to the inert reference, giving $T_{\\text{sample}}  T_{\\text{reference}}$, hence $\\Delta T  0$ and a negative deflection.\n- During an exothermic event in the sample (e.g., crystallization, exothermic decomposition, curing), the sample releases heat, making $T_{\\text{sample}} > T_{\\text{reference}}$, hence $\\Delta T > 0$ and a positive deflection.\n\nInterpretation of feature at $T_{1}$:\n- The trace exhibits a sharp, negative dip at $T_{1}$, then returns to baseline. A sharp peak at a well-defined temperature with negative sign is characteristic of a first-order endothermic transition with latent heat, most plausibly melting. Melting typically appears as a narrow, well-defined endothermic peak because it occurs at a specific equilibrium temperature $T_{m}$ under quasi-equilibrium conditions.\n- A glass transition would not produce a sharp peak nor a distinct negative dip; it has no latent heat and manifests as a baseline shift due to a change in heat capacity $C_{p}$ rather than a peak. Therefore, a sharp negative dip at $T_{1}$ is inconsistent with a glass transition.\n\nInterpretation of feature at $T_{2} > T_{1}$:\n- The broad, positive peak centered at $T_{2}$ indicates an exothermic process distributed over a temperature range, which is typical of kinetically controlled processes such as exothermic decomposition or cold crystallization of an amorphous material. Since the signal returns to baseline after the peak, it corresponds to a discrete exothermic event that completes over that interval.\n- If it were endothermic decomposition, the sign would be negative, contradicting the observed positive peak. Boiling (vaporization) is endothermic and would also produce a negative feature, not positive.\n\nConsistency check of given options:\n- Option A (melting at $T_{1}$, then endothermic decomposition at $T_{2}$) predicts a negative peak at $T_{2}$, inconsistent with the observed positive broad peak.\n- Option B (glass transition at $T_{1}$, then crystallization at $T_{2}$) misassigns the first feature: a glass transition does not produce a sharp negative dip; moreover, while crystallization is exothermic and could give a broad positive peak, the $T_{1}$ feature is incompatible with $T_{g}$.\n- Option C (melting at $T_{1}$, then exothermic decomposition at $T_{2}$) matches both the sharp negative peak at $T_{1}$ (melting, endothermic) and the broad positive peak at $T_{2}$ (exothermic decomposition), and is physically plausible for an organic compound.\n- Option D (exothermic reaction at $T_{1}$, then boiling at $T_{2}$) predicts a positive peak at $T_{1}$ and a negative peak at $T_{2}$, both opposite to observations.\n- Option E (crystallization at $T_{1}$, then melting at $T_{2}$) would give a positive peak at $T_{1}$ (exothermic) and a negative peak at $T_{2}$ (endothermic), inconsistent with the signs observed.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible sequence matching the observed sharp negative dip at $T_{1}$ and broad positive peak at $T_{2}$ is melting followed by an exothermic decomposition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1437256"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of an analytical technique requires thinking critically about the instrument's fundamental principles.
