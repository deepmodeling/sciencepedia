The technique being used is $^{1}$H-$^{1}$H Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY), which reveals scalar (J-coupling) interactions between protons.\n\nThe one-dimensional $^{1}$H NMR spectrum of 1,3-dichloropropane in a standard deuterated solvent shows two distinct signals. The protons on the carbons adjacent to the chlorine atoms (C1 and C3) appear at a chemical shift of approximately $\\delta = 3.75$ ppm. The protons on the central carbon atom (C2) appear at a chemical shift of approximately $\\delta = 2.20$ ppm.\n\nA COSY spectrum is plotted with the one-dimensional $^{1}$H NMR spectrum on both the horizontal (F2) and vertical (F1) axes. The spectrum contains diagonal peaks, which correspond to the signals in the 1D spectrum, and cross-peaks (off-diagonal peaks), which indicate coupling between protons at different chemical shifts. A cross-peak at coordinates $(\\delta_X, \\delta_Y)$ signifies that the protons at chemical shift $\\delta_X$ are J-coupled to the protons at chemical shift $\\delta_Y$.\n\nBased on the structure of 1,3-dichloropropane and the principles of COSY, which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the expected spectrum?\n\nA. The spectrum will show two diagonal peaks at approximately (3.75, 3.75) and (2.20, 2.20). A pair of cross-peaks will appear at approximately (3.75, 2.20) and (2.20, 3.75).\n\nB. The spectrum will show two diagonal peaks at approximately (3.75, 3.75) and (2.20, 2.20), but will show no cross-peaks because the protons are on different carbon atoms.\n\nC. The spectrum will show three diagonal peaks, corresponding to the three chemically non-equivalent CH$_2$ groups, and two pairs of cross-peaks connecting adjacent groups.\n\nD. The spectrum will show only a single diagonal peak because all six protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.\n\nE. The spectrum will show two diagonal peaks at approximately (3.75, 3.75) and (2.20, 2.20), but only a single cross-peak at (3.75, 2.20), as the correlation is only from the downfield to the upfield protons.", "solution": "Identify distinct proton sets by symmetry. In 1,3-dichloropropane, the two terminal methylene groups are related by symmetry, so their protons have the same chemical shift. Denote the terminal methylenes as C1 and C3 and the central methylene as C2. Then\n$$\\delta(\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C1}})=\\delta(\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C3}})\\approx 3.75\\ \\mathrm{ppm},\\quad \\delta(\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C2}})\\approx 2.20\\ \\mathrm{ppm}.$$\nTherefore, the 1D spectrum contains two signals, giving two diagonal peaks in a COSY at $(3.75,3.75)$ and $(2.20,2.20)$.\n\nDetermine which proton sets are scalar coupled. In an alkane chain, vicinal $^{3}J_{\\mathrm{HH}}$ couplings exist between adjacent methylene protons. Thus $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C1}}$ couples to $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C2}}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C3}}$ couples to $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C2}}$. Because C1 and C3 are symmetry equivalent, both couplings have the same $^{3}J_{\\mathrm{HH}}$ magnitude and connect the same two chemical shifts, $3.75$ and $2.20$. Long-range $^{4}J_{\\mathrm{HH}}$ across the three-carbon chain between $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C1}}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C3}}$ is typically negligible and, moreover, any correlation between magnetically equivalent nuclei at the same chemical shift would not produce a resolvable off-diagonal cross-peak.\n\nApply COSY cross-peak principle. In $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$-$^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ COSY, a cross-peak at $(\\delta_{X},\\delta_{Y})$ indicates $J$-coupling between the spins at $\\delta_{X}$ and $\\delta_{Y}$. The COSY spectrum is symmetric with respect to the diagonal, so a cross-peak at $(\\delta_{X},\\delta_{Y})$ is accompanied by one at $(\\delta_{Y},\\delta_{X})$. Therefore, the vicinal couplings between the terminal and central methylenes produce a pair of cross-peaks at approximately $(3.75,2.20)$ and $(2.20,3.75)$.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A states two diagonal peaks and a symmetric pair of cross-peaks at $(3.75,2.20)$ and $(2.20,3.75)$, which matches the above reasoning.\n- B is incorrect because vicinal $^{3}J_{\\mathrm{HH}}$ couplings between different carbons do produce COSY cross-peaks.\n- C is incorrect because there are only two chemically distinct CH$_{2}$ groups due to symmetry, not three.\n- D is incorrect because not all six protons are equivalent; there are two distinct environments.\n- E is incorrect because COSY cross-peaks are symmetric; one does not observe only a single off-diagonal cross-peak.\n\nHence, A is the most accurate description.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1485941"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond prediction, the true power of 2D NMR lies in solving molecular puzzles.

This problem [@problem_id:1485944] simulates a common challenge where a key correlation in a COSY spectrum is obscured by noise, rendering the experiment inconclusive.

The one-dimensional $^{1}\\text{H}$ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum shows two distinct multiplets in the aliphatic region, centered at $\\delta_A = 2.15$ ppm (Proton A) and $\\delta_B = 2.80$ ppm (Proton B).

The resulting 2D spectrum displays the expected diagonal peaks for Proton A and Proton B. However, the region where the cross-peak correlating A and B is expected is obscured. The issue is twofold: the suspected cross-peak is intrinsically weak, and it falls directly in a vertical stripe of noise (known as $t_1$-noise) that originates from the intense, unsuppressed residual solvent signal (water at 4.7 ppm).

We need to find the most robust experimental alternative to establish the `C(A)-C(B)` bond connectivity. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**A. Re-run the COSY experiment with four times the number of scans.**\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in an NMR experiment improves with the square root of the number of scans ($N_s$). Increasing the scans by a factor of four would increase the S/N by a factor of $\\sqrt{4} = 2$. This would make the weak cross-peak twice as intense. However, the $t_1$-noise originates from the very intense solvent signal, and this artifact's intensity will also increase. While the S/N of the desired peak improves relative to the thermal background noise, it may not become visible against the now-stronger $t_1$-noise stripe. This approach is time-consuming and may not solve the fundamental problem of the artifact obscuring the signal.\n\n**B. Perform a one-dimensional Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) experiment.**\nThe NOE is a through-space phenomenon, not a through-bond one. It provides information about which protons are close to each other in 3D space (typically < 5 Å). While vicinal protons in a `–CH(A)–CH(B)–` fragment are often close enough to produce an NOE, this is not guaranteed, especially in a conformationally flexible molecule where the time-averaged distance might be large. A weak or absent NOE does not disprove the existence of a through-bond $^{3}J$ coupling. Therefore, an NOE experiment does not directly and unambiguously confirm the bond connectivity. It only confirms spatial proximity.\n\n**C. Perform a Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation (HMBC) experiment.**\nHMBC is a 2D NMR experiment that shows correlations between nuclei (typically $^{1}\\text{H}$ and $^{13}\\text{C}$) that are separated by multiple bonds, usually 2 or 3 bonds ($^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$ and $^{3}J_{\\text{CH}}$). For the suspected `–CH(A)–CH(B)–` fragment, Proton A is separated from Carbon B by two bonds (H(A)-C(A)-C(B)), and Proton B is separated from Carbon A by two bonds (H(B)-C(B)-C(A)). An HMBC experiment would therefore be expected to show a cross-peak correlating the chemical shift of Proton A ($\\delta_A$) with the chemical shift of Carbon B ($\\delta_{CB}$), and another cross-peak correlating Proton B ($\\delta_B$) with Carbon A ($\\delta_{CA}$). The observation of either of these cross-peaks would provide definitive proof of the `C(A)-C(B)` bond, and thus confirm the connectivity that the COSY experiment failed to show. This method bypasses the problematic $^{1}\\text{H}$-$^{1}\\text{H}$ correlation by using a different, often more robust, heteronuclear pathway. This is the most direct and effective strategy.\n\n**D. Perform a Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (DEPT-135) experiment.**\nA DEPT-135 experiment is a one-dimensional $^{13}\\text{C}$ NMR technique used to determine the multiplicity of carbon atoms (i.e., whether they are CH, CH$_2$, or CH$_3$ groups). It would show positive signals for CH and CH$_3$ carbons and negative signals for CH$_2$ carbons. While this experiment can confirm that the carbons at $\\delta_{CA}$ and $\\delta_{CB}$ are methines (CH groups), it provides no information about how these carbons are connected to each other. It cannot confirm the `C(A)-C(B)` bond.\n\n**E. Perform a Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) experiment.**\nAn HSQC experiment (or its predecessor, HETCOR) is a 2D NMR technique that shows correlations between protons and the carbons to which they are directly attached (one-bond coupling, $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$). This experiment would show a cross-peak correlating Proton A with Carbon A, and another cross-peak correlating Proton B with Carbon B. This is useful for assigning which proton is attached to which carbon, but like the DEPT experiment, it provides no information about the connectivity *between* the `C(A)H(A)` and `C(B)H(B)` units. It does not solve the problem of confirming the vicinal relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the options, the HMBC experiment is the only one that directly probes the multi-bond connectivity between the two fragments of interest in a way that is robust and circumvents the issues encountered in the COSY spectrum. Therefore, it is the most effective and direct strategy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1485944"}]}
