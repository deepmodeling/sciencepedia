To elucidate its structure, a proton-decoupled Carbon-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^{13}$C NMR) spectrum is recorded. The spectrum reveals the presence of exactly two signals. Assuming the compound is one of the isomers listed below, which structure is consistent with this spectroscopic data?\n\nA. Cyclohexane\nB. 1-Hexene\nC. 2,3-Dimethyl-2-butene\nD. 4-Methyl-1-pentene\nE. Methylcyclopentane", "solution": "The fundamental principle of proton-decoupled Carbon-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^{13}$C NMR) spectroscopy is that the number of signals (or peaks) in the spectrum corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms in a molecule. Carbon atoms are considered chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like a plane of symmetry or an axis of rotation) or by a rapid conformational process. The problem states that a compound with the formula $C_6H_{12}$ exhibits exactly two signals in its $^{13}$C NMR spectrum. We must analyze the structure of each of the given isomers to determine how many sets of chemically non-equivalent carbons it contains.\n\nA. Cyclohexane ($C_6H_{12}$): This is a cyclic alkane. At room temperature, cyclohexane undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This process is so fast on the NMR timescale that all axial and equatorial positions average out, rendering all six carbon atoms chemically equivalent. Consequently, cyclohexane shows only one signal in its $^{13}$C NMR spectrum. This does not match the observed two signals.\n\nB. 1-Hexene ($\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_3$): This is a straight-chain alkene. There are no elements of symmetry that would make any of the carbon atoms equivalent. Each carbon is in a unique position relative to the double bond and the end of the chain. Therefore, 1-hexene will show six distinct signals in its $^{13}$C NMR spectrum. This does not match the observed two signals.\n\nC. 2,3-Dimethyl-2-butene ($(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{C}=\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$): This alkene is highly symmetric. There is a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the C=C bond and passing through its midpoint. This symmetry makes the two $sp^2$ hybridized carbons of the double bond chemically equivalent. It also makes all four methyl (CH₃) groups chemically equivalent to each other. Therefore, the molecule contains only two sets of non-equivalent carbons: (1) the two carbons of the C=C double bond, and (2) the four carbons of the methyl groups. This structure would produce exactly two signals in its $^{13}$C NMR spectrum. This matches the experimental data.\n\nD. 4-Methyl-1-pentene ($\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$): This is a branched alkene. There are no elements of symmetry in the molecule. However, the two methyl groups attached to C4 are equivalent to each other due to free rotation around the C3-C4 single bond. Carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4 are all in unique chemical environments. Thus, there are five sets of chemically non-equivalent carbons: C1, C2, C3, C4, and the two equivalent C5 methyl carbons. This structure would show five signals. This does not match the observed two signals.\n\nE. Methylcyclopentane ($C_6H_{12}$): This is a substituted cycloalkane. The methyl substituent breaks the high symmetry of the parent cyclopentane ring. Let's label the ring carbons C1 through C5, with the methyl group attached to C1.\n- The methyl carbon is unique (one signal).\n- The ring carbon C1, to which the methyl group is attached, is unique (a second signal).\n- The ring carbons C2 and C5 are adjacent to C1 and are equivalent to each other due to a plane of symmetry passing through C1, the methyl group, and the C3-C4 bond midpoint (assuming rapid puckering of the ring). This forms a third set of equivalent carbons.\n- The ring carbons C3 and C4 are further from C1 and are equivalent to each other by the same plane of symmetry. This forms a fourth set.\nIn total, methylcyclopentane has four sets of chemically non-equivalent carbons and would therefore show four signals in its $^{13}$C NMR spectrum. This does not match the observed two signals.\n\nBased on the analysis of all options, only 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene is predicted to have a $^{13}$C NMR spectrum with two signals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1429600"}, {"introduction": "While counting signals tells us *how many* types of carbons are present, it doesn't tell us *what kind* they are. To solve this, chemists use advanced techniques like the Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (DEPT) experiment.

The resulting DEPT-135 spectrum shows 3 positive signals and 1 negative signal.\n\nBased on this spectral information, which of the following compounds is the unknown alkane?\n\nA. n-Hexane\nB. 2-Methylpentane\nC. 3-Methylpentane\nD. 2,2-Dimethylbutane\nE. 2,3-Dimethylbutane", "solution": "In a broadband proton-decoupled $^{13}$C NMR spectrum, the number of distinct signals equals the number of unique carbon environments. In a DEPT-135 experiment, the phase of signals identifies multiplicity: CH and CH₃ carbons appear positive, CH₂ carbons appear negative, and quaternary carbons do not appear at all.\n\n- The observation of 4 signals in the broadband $^{13}$C spectrum implies exactly 4 unique carbon environments.\n- The DEPT-135 result of 3 positive and 1 negative signal implies the compound has carbon types that sum to this pattern. Since the total number of signals (4) matches the total in the DEPT-135 spectrum, there are no quaternary carbons. The pattern corresponds to three unique CH or CH₃ environments and one unique CH₂ environment.\n\nWe evaluate each candidate isomer of $C_6H_{14}$ against these constraints:\n\nA. n-Hexane ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$): This molecule has a plane of symmetry, making carbons C1 & C6 equivalent, C2 & C5 equivalent, and C3 & C4 equivalent. This results in **3 signals**, which contradicts the observed 4 signals.\n\nB. 2-Methylpentane ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$): This molecule has no symmetry elements. Therefore, all six of its carbons are chemically non-equivalent. It should exhibit **6 signals**, contradicting the observed 4 signals.\n\nC. 3-Methylpentane ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$): The carbon at position 3 is a stereocenter, making the molecule chiral. Consequently, the two ethyl groups are diastereotopic, and all six carbons are technically unique, which would predict 6 signals. However, in practice, the chemical shift differences between the corresponding carbons of the two diastereotopic ethyl groups are often negligible, leading to \"accidental equivalence.\" This results in an observed spectrum of **4 signals**: one for the two equivalent terminal CH₃ groups, one for the two equivalent CH₂ groups, one for the unique methyl group at C3, and one for the unique CH group at C3. This set of carbons (two CH₃ types, one CH type, one CH₂ type) gives 3 positive signals and 1 negative signal in a DEPT-135 spectrum. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\nD. 2,2-Dimethylbutane ($(CH_3)_3\\text{CCH}_2\\text{CH}_3$): The three methyl groups attached to the quaternary carbon C2 are equivalent. The quaternary C2 is unique, the CH₂ at C3 is unique, and the CH₃ at C4 is unique. This results in **4 signals**. Let's check the DEPT-135 pattern. We have two unique CH₃ environments (the C2-methyls and the C4-methyl) which would give 2 positive signals, and one unique CH₂ environment which would give 1 negative signal. The quaternary carbon would be absent. The DEPT-135 would show 2 positive and 1 negative signal. This contradicts the observed 3 positive and 1 negative signals.\n\nE. 2,3-Dimethylbutane ($(CH_3)_2\\text{CHCH}(CH_3)_2$): This highly symmetric molecule has a plane of symmetry passing between C2 and C3 in its anti-conformation. This makes the two CH groups equivalent and all four CH₃ groups equivalent. This results in **2 signals**, contradicting the observed 4 signals.\n\nOnly 3-methylpentane, due to accidental equivalence, matches both the broadband signal count of 4 and the DEPT-135 pattern of 3 positive and 1 negative signals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2158188"}, {"introduction": "Standard $^{13}$C NMR spectra are typically \"proton-decoupled\" to simplify the spectrum into single lines.
