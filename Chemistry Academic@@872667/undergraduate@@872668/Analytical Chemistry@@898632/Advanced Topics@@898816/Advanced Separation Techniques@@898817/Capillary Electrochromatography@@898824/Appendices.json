An analyte's total journey time, its migration time ($t_m$), is composed of the time it spends moving with the mobile phase ($t_{eof}$) and the time it is retained by the stationary phase ($t_s$). This practice guides you to derive a mathematical relationship that isolates the time an analyte spends in the stationary phase. This exercise reinforces the fundamental principles of retention in chromatography and demonstrates how to quantify these effects using directly measurable experimental data [@problem_id:1428964].", "problem": "In the analytical technique of Capillary Electrochromatography (CEC), a separation column is created by packing a capillary with a solid stationary phase. When a high voltage is applied across the ends of this capillary, an Electroosmotic Flow (EOF) is generated. This bulk fluid movement acts as a pump, driving the mobile phase through the packed bed. The time required for an unretained substance—one that does not interact with the stationary phase—to travel the full length of the capillary is known as the EOF time and is denoted by $t_{eof}$. This time effectively represents the residence time of the mobile phase in the column.\n\nA neutral analyte molecule is injected into the CEC system. This analyte interacts with the stationary phase, leading to its retention. It partitions between being adsorbed onto the stationary phase (where it is immobile) and being dissolved in the mobile phase (where it is carried along by the EOF). The total time measured from injection until the analyte is detected at the column exit is its migration time, $t_m$.\n\nAssuming that the analyte travels at the same velocity as the bulk mobile phase whenever it is not adsorbed to the stationary phase, derive a mathematical expression for the fraction of total time that the analyte spends associated with the stationary phase.

Therefore, the time that any component spends being transported by the mobile phase throughout the length of the column must be equal to $t_{eof}$.\n$$t_{mp} = t_{eof}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this result into our expression for $t_s$:\n$$t_s = t_m - t_{eof}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $t_s$ back into the original definition of the fraction of time spent in the stationary phase, $F_s$.\n$$F_s = \\frac{t_s}{t_m} = \\frac{t_m - t_{eof}}{t_m}$$\n\nThis expression represents the fraction of total time the analyte spends in the stationary phase, expressed solely in terms of the measurable quantities $t_m$ and $t_{eof}$.
