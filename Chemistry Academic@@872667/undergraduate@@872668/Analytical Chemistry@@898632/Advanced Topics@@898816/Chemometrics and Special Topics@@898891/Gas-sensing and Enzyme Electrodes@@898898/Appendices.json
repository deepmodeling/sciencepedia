This exercise presents a common diagnostic challenge: interpreting an electrode's deviation from its theoretical Nernstian response. By modeling how a physical flaw, such as a tear in the gas-permeable membrane, can lead to a stable but incorrect calibration slope, you will develop critical troubleshooting skills and deepen your understanding of how potentiometric sensors function in non-ideal conditions [@problem_id:1442400].", "problem": "An analytical chemist is calibrating a potentiometric ammonia gas-sensing electrode at a temperature of 298.15 K. The electrode consists of an internal pH-sensitive glass electrode and a silver/silver chloride reference electrode, both immersed in a concentrated internal filling solution of ammonium chloride, $[\\text{NH}_4\\text{Cl}]_{\\text{int}}$. This entire assembly is separated from the sample solution by a hydrophobic, gas-permeable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane.\n\nFor the calibration, a series of standard solutions are prepared with known total ammonia concentrations ($C_{\\text{total}}$). The pH of each standard is adjusted to 11.5 to ensure that all ammonium species are converted to dissolved ammonia gas ($\\text{NH}_3$). According to the Nernst equation, a plot of the measured potential, $E$, versus the logarithm of the ammonia concentration, $\\log(C_{\\text{total}})$, should yield a straight line with a theoretical slope of approximately -59.16 mV/decade for a monovalent species at this temperature.\n\nHowever, the chemist observes that while the calibration plot is linear over the tested concentration range, its slope is stable at -47.5 mV/decade, a magnitude significantly lower than expected. The potential readings for each standard are also stable. A physical inspection of the electrode suggests the possibility of a microscopic tear in the PTFE membrane.\n\nThe proposed hypothesis for this sub-Nernstian response is that the tear causes a slow but constant leak of the internal filling solution. This leak introduces a steady-state concentration of ammonium ions, which we will denote as $C_{\\text{leak}}$, into the thin layer of the sample solution immediately in contact with the membrane surface. Due to the high pH of the sample, these leaked ammonium ions are instantaneously converted to additional ammonia gas at the membrane surface. As a result, the electrode is responding to a surface ammonia concentration that is the sum of the bulk concentration and this leak-generated concentration.\n\nAssuming this hypothesis is correct, calculate the dimensionless ratio of the leak-generated ammonia concentration to the bulk ammonia concentration, $\\frac{C_{\\text{leak}}}{C_{\\text{total}}}$, for the operating point where the measured slope is -47.5 mV/decade. Express your answer as a real number rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the ratio of the leaked ammonia concentration to the bulk ammonia concentration, $\\frac{C_{\\text{leak}}}{C_{\\text{total}}}$, based on a measured sub-Nernstian slope of an ammonia gas-sensing electrode.\n\nFirst, let's establish the theoretical behavior of the electrode. The potential, $E$, of an ideal ammonia gas-sensing electrode is described by the Nernst equation. The electrode's response is governed by the concentration (or more accurately, activity) of ammonia, $C_{\\text{NH}_3}$, at the membrane surface. The internal pH electrode detects changes in hydroxide concentration resulting from the ammonia equilibrium, $\\text{NH}_3 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{NH}_4^+ + \\text{OH}^-$. This leads to a potential response that is logarithmic with respect to the ammonia concentration. For a monovalent response at a temperature $T$, the equation is:\n$$E = K - S \\log(C_{\\text{NH}_3})$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant potential term that includes reference electrode potentials and junction potentials, and $S$ is the theoretical Nernstian slope, given by $S = \\frac{2.303RT}{zF}$. Here, $R$ is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹), $T$ is the absolute temperature (298.15 K), $F$ is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol⁻¹), and $z$ is the charge of the ion determining the response (for the pH-based detection mechanism, $z=1$). At 298.15 K, the theoretical slope is $S \\approx 59.16$ mV/decade.\n\nAccording to the problem's hypothesis, the ammonia concentration at the membrane surface, let's call it $C_{\\text{surf}}$, is not equal to the bulk concentration $C_{\\text{total}}$. Instead, it is the sum of the bulk concentration and the additional concentration generated by the leak, $C_{\\text{leak}}$.\n$$C_{\\text{surf}} = C_{\\text{total}} + C_{\\text{leak}}$$\nThe electrode's potential is therefore a function of this surface concentration:\n$$E = K - S \\log(C_{\\text{surf}}) = K - S \\log(C_{\\text{total}} + C_{\\text{leak}})$$\n\nThe operational slope of the calibration curve is the derivative of the potential $E$ with respect to the logarithm of the bulk concentration, $\\log(C_{\\text{total}})$. We can find this slope using the chain rule:\n$$\\text{Slope} = \\frac{dE}{d(C_{\\text{total}})} \\cdot \\frac{d(C_{\\text{total}})}{d(\\log C_{\\text{total}})}$$\n\nLet's calculate each part of the derivative. First, the derivative of $E$ with respect to $C_{\\text{total}}$. Note that $\\log(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(10)}$.\n$$\\frac{dE}{dC_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{d}{dC_{\\text{total}}} \\left[ K - S \\frac{\\ln(C_{\\text{total}} + C_{\\text{leak}})}{\\ln(10)} \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dE}{dC_{\\text{total}}} = -\\frac{S}{\\ln(10)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{total}} + C_{\\text{leak}}}$$\n\nNext, let's find the derivative of $C_{\\text{total}}$ with respect to $\\log(C_{\\text{total}})$. Let $y = \\log(C_{\\text{total}})$. This means $C_{\\text{total}} = 10^y$. We want to find $\\frac{d(C_{\\text{total}})}{dy}$.\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = 10^y = \\exp(y \\ln(10))$$\n$$\\frac{dC_{\\text{total}}}{dy} = \\ln(10) \\cdot \\exp(y \\ln(10)) = \\ln(10) \\cdot 10^y = \\ln(10) \\cdot C_{\\text{total}}$$\nSo, $\\frac{d(C_{\\text{total}})}{d(\\log C_{\\text{total}})} = C_{\\text{total}} \\ln(10)$.\n\nNow, we combine the two parts to find the expression for the operational slope:\n$$\\text{Slope} = \\left( -\\frac{S}{\\ln(10)} \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{total}} + C_{\\text{leak}}} \\right) \\cdot (C_{\\text{total}} \\ln(10))$$\n$$\\text{Slope} = -S \\left( \\frac{C_{\\text{total}}}{C_{\\text{total}} + C_{\\text{leak}}} \\right)$$\n\nThis derived expression shows that the measured slope is the ideal Nernstian slope $S$ multiplied by a factor $\\frac{C_{\\text{total}}}{C_{\\text{total}} + C_{\\text{leak}}}$, which is always less than 1. This confirms that the hypothesis of a leak can lead to a sub-Nernstian slope.\n\nWe are given the measured slope and the theoretical slope:\n$\\text{Slope}_{measured} = -47.5$ mV/decade\n$S = 59.16$ mV/decade\n\nWe can now set the derived expression equal to the measured value to solve for the unknown ratio.\n$$-47.5 = -59.16 \\left( \\frac{C_{\\text{total}}}{C_{\\text{total}} + C_{\\text{leak}}} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{47.5}{59.16} = \\frac{C_{\\text{total}}}{C_{\\text{total}} + C_{\\text{leak}}}$$\nTo solve for the ratio $\\frac{C_{\\text{leak}}}{C_{\\text{total}}}$, we can invert both sides:\n$$\\frac{59.16}{47.5} = \\frac{C_{\\text{total}} + C_{\\text{leak}}}{C_{\\text{total}}}$$\n$$\\frac{59.16}{47.5} = 1 + \\frac{C_{\\text{leak}}}{C_{\\text{total}}}$$\nNow, isolate the desired ratio:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{leak}}}{C_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{59.16}{47.5} - 1$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{leak}}}{C_{\\text{total}}} = 1.2454736... - 1$$\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{leak}}}{C_{\\text{total}}} = 0.2454736...$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{leak}}}{C_{\\text{total}}} \\approx 0.245$$\nThis means that at the point of measurement, the concentration of ammonia generated from the leak is about 24.5% of the bulk ammonia concentration in the standard solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.245}$$", "id": "1442400"}]}
