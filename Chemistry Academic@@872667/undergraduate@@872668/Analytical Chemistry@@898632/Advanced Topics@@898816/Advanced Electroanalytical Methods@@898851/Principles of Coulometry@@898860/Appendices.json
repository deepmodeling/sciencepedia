This is a problem in coulometry, which relates electric charge to the amount of substance transformed in an electrochemical reaction.\n\nFirst, we identify the half-reaction for the deposition of gold from a +3 oxidation state:\n$$ \\text{Au}^{3+}(aq) + 3e^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{Au}(s) $$\nThis equation shows that for every one mole of solid gold (Au) deposited, three moles of electrons ($e^{-}$) are consumed. Therefore, the number of electrons transferred per ion, $n$, is 3.\n\nThe total electric charge, $Q$, passed through the solution is related to the constant current, $I$, and the duration of the electrolysis, $t$, by the equation:\n$$ Q = I \\times t $$\n\nAccording to Faraday's laws of electrolysis, the total charge $Q$ is also related to the number of moles of substance deposited and the stoichiometry of the reaction. The total charge is the product of the number of moles of electrons ($n_e$) and Faraday's constant ($F$):\n$$ Q = n_e F $$\nThe number of moles of electrons, $n_e$, can be related to the number of moles of gold deposited, $n_{Au}$. From the stoichiometry of the half-reaction, we have $n_e = 3 \\times n_{Au}$.\nThe number of moles of gold, $n_{Au}$, is the mass of gold deposited, $m$, divided by its molar mass, $M_{Au}$:\n$$ n_{Au} = \\frac{m}{M_{Au}} $$\nCombining these, we get an expression for the total charge in terms of the mass of gold:\n$$ Q = 3 \\times \\frac{m}{M_{Au}} \\times F $$\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for the total charge $Q$:\n$$ I \\times t = \\frac{3 m F}{M_{Au}} $$\nWe need to solve for the current, $I$:\n$$ I = \\frac{3 m F}{M_{Au} t} $$\n\nBefore substituting the values, we must ensure all units are consistent.
