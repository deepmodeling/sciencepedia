For helium, the valence shell is the $1s$ orbital with two electrons in neutral He. For hydrogen, the valence shell is the $1s$ orbital with one electron in neutral H. The total number of electrons in the molecular ion $HeH^{+}$ is obtained from the neutral atom counts minus one for the positive charge:\n$$N_{e} = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2.$$\n\nUsing the linear combination of atomic orbitals principle, the two $1s$ orbitals combine to form a lower-energy bonding molecular orbital $\\sigma_{1s}$ and a higher-energy antibonding molecular orbital $\\sigma_{1s}^{*}$.

This problem introduces the complexity of handling a larger number of electrons and an unpaired electron, which is characteristic of a radical. By determining its bond order, you will practice applying MO principles to predict the properties of reactive chemical intermediates.

This species is a heteronuclear diatomic molecule formed from a second-period oxygen atom and a second-period fluorine atom. To construct the Molecular Orbital (MO) diagram for the valence electrons, you should make the following standard assumptions:\n1.  Only the valence atomic orbitals (2s and 2p) of oxygen and fluorine contribute to the formation of molecular orbitals.\n2.  Fluorine is more electronegative than oxygen, meaning its atomic orbitals are at a lower energy.\n3.  The relative energy ordering of the molecular orbitals is analogous to that of heavier homonuclear diatomic molecules (like $O_2$ and $F_2$), where the effects of s-p mixing are minimal. This means the $\\sigma_{2p}$ molecular orbital is lower in energy than the $\\pi_{2p}$ molecular orbitals.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the bond order of the OF radical. Express your answer as a decimal value.", "solution": "We first count the total number of valence electrons. Oxygen contributes $6$ ($2s^{2}2p^{4}$) and fluorine contributes $7$ ($2s^{2}2p^{5}$), so the OF radical has $6+7=13$ valence electrons.\n\nUnder the given assumptions, only $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals form molecular orbitals, with fluorine’s atomic orbitals lower in energy, and the MO energy ordering analogous to $O_2$/$F_2$ (minimal $s$-$p$ mixing), namely\n$$\n\\sigma_{2s} < \\sigma_{2s}^{\\ast} < \\sigma_{2p} < \\pi_{2p} < \\pi_{2p}^{\\ast} < \\sigma_{2p}^{\\ast}.\n$$\nBy the Aufbau principle and Hund’s rule, we fill from lowest to highest energy. The $2s$-derived orbitals are filled with $4$ electrons total ($2$ in $\\sigma_{2s}$ and $2$ in $\\sigma_{2s}^{\\ast}$), contributing net zero to the bond order. That leaves $13-4=9$ electrons for the $2p$-derived set.\n\nFilling the $2p$-derived MOs:\n- $\\sigma_{2p}$ receives $2$ electrons.\n- The degenerate $\\pi_{2p}$ set receives $4$ electrons (two pairs), totaling $6$ electrons in bonding $2p$ MOs.\n- The remaining $9-6=3$ electrons occupy the degenerate $\\pi_{2p}^{\\ast}$ set (one pair and one unpaired), while $\\sigma_{2p}^{\\ast}$ remains empty.\n\nThus, in the $2p$ manifold, the number of bonding electrons is $N_{b}=6$ and the number of antibonding electrons is $N_{ab}=3$.

This exercise asks you to compare the bonding description of the cyanide ion ($CN^{-}$) using both Lewis structures and MO theory.

Its bonding can be described by both simple Lewis structures and more sophisticated Molecular Orbital (MO) theory. To construct an accurate MO diagram for a heteronuclear diatomic species like $CN^{-}$, the relative energies of the constituent atomic orbitals must be considered.\n\nAssume the following valence orbital ionization energies (VOIEs), which represent the negative of the orbital energies, for carbon and nitrogen:\n- Carbon (C): $E_{2s} = -19.43 \\text{ eV}$, $E_{2p} = -10.66 \\text{ eV}$\n- Nitrogen (N): $E_{2s} = -25.56 \\text{ eV}$, $E_{2p} = -13.18 \\text{ eV}$\n\nBased on an analysis of both the dominant Lewis structure and the MO model for the cyanide ion, which of the following statements provides the most accurate comparison of the bond orders predicted by each model?\n\nA.

The dominant Lewis structure predicts a bond order of 3, and the MO model also predicts a bond order of 3. The models are in agreement.\n\nC. The dominant Lewis structure predicts a bond order of 3, but the MO model predicts a lower bond order of 2.5 due to the energy mismatch between carbon and nitrogen atomic orbitals. The models disagree.\n\nD. Both the Lewis structure and the MO model predict a non-integer bond order of 2.5, suggesting significant resonance that is captured by both theories.\n\nE. The dominant Lewis structure for $CN^{-}$ must violate the octet rule, making its bond order ambiguous. In contrast, MO theory provides a clear prediction of a bond order of 3.", "solution": "We first determine the dominant Lewis structure for $CN^{-}$. Carbon has $4$ valence electrons, nitrogen has $5$, and the negative charge adds $1$, giving a total of $10$ valence electrons. The dominant Lewis structure places a triple bond between C and N and assigns a lone pair to each atom, with the formal negative charge localized on carbon. This structure satisfies the octet rule for both atoms and implies a bond order of $3$ from Lewis theory.\n\nNext, we analyze the molecular orbital (MO) model using valence orbitals. The given valence orbital ionization energies indicate that the nitrogen $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals are lower in energy than the corresponding carbon orbitals:\n$$\nE_{2s}(\\text{N}) < E_{2s}(\\text{C}), \\quad E_{2p}(\\text{N}) < E_{2p}(\\text{C}).\n$$\nThis energy mismatch leads to heteronuclear MOs that are polarized (more nitrogen character in the lower-energy bonding MOs and more carbon character in the higher-energy MOs), but it does not change the occupancy pattern for a $14$-electron diatomic (or $10$ valence electrons when core $1s$ orbitals are excluded). For second-row diatomics in the $N_2$-like regime, the typical valence MO ordering (including $2s$–$2p$ mixing) is\n$$\n\\sigma_{2s} < \\sigma_{2s}^{*} < \\pi_{2p} < \\sigma_{2p} < \\pi_{2p}^{*} < \\sigma_{2p}^{*}.\n$$\nWe now place the $10$ valence electrons of $CN^{-}$ into these MOs:\n- Bonding MOs: $\\sigma_{2s}$ (2 e$^{-}$), $\\pi_{2p}$ (4 e$^{-}$), $\\sigma_{2p}$ (2 e$^{-}$) for a total of $N_{b} = 8$ bonding electrons.\n- Antibonding MOs: $\\sigma_{2s}^{*}$ (2 e$^{-}$), with $\\pi_{2p}^{*}$ and $\\sigma_{2p}^{*}$ unoccupied, for a total of $N_{a} = 2$ antibonding electrons.\n\nThe MO bond order is then\n$$\n\\text{bond order} = \\frac{N_{b} - N_{a}}{2} = \\frac{8 - 2}{2} = 3.\n$$\nThus, both the dominant Lewis structure and the MO model predict a bond order of $3$. The heteronuclear nature and the VOIE differences affect orbital localization but do not change the electron count in bonding versus antibonding MOs for this case. Therefore, the correct statement is that the models agree, both giving a bond order of $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1993528"}]}
