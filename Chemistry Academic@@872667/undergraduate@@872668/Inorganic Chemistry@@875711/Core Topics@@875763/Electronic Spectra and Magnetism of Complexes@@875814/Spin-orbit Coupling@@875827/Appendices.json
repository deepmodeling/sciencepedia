This practice explores why an electron in an $s$-orbital behaves differently from one in a $p$-orbital regarding this interaction [@problem_id:2289235]. Mastering this concept helps clarify that spin-orbit coupling is not a universal effect for all electrons but is contingent on non-zero orbital angular momentum.", "problem": "In quantum mechanics, spin-orbit coupling refers to the interaction between an electron's intrinsic spin magnetic moment and the magnetic field generated by the electron's orbital motion around the nucleus. This interaction leads to a shift in the energy levels of atomic states. Consider a neutral lithium atom (Li), which has an atomic number of 3. Its ground state electronic configuration is $1s^2 2s^1$, and a primary excited state configuration is $1s^2 2p^1$. A key observation is that the first-order energy correction due to spin-orbit coupling for the valence electron is zero in the ground state but is non-zero in this excited state.\n\nWhich one of the following statements provides the correct physical justification for this difference in spin-orbit coupling effects between the $2s^1$ and $2p^1$ valence electrons?\n\nA. The orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$, is 0 for an electron in a 2s orbital, which means it has no orbital angular momentum to couple with its spin. In contrast, $l=1$ for an electron in a 2p orbital, allowing for a non-zero coupling.\n\nB. The spin quantum number, $s$, of the valence electron is 0 in the $2s^1$ state but is $1/2$ in the $2p^1$ state, and spin-orbit coupling requires a non-zero spin.\n\nC. The principal quantum number, $n$, is the same for both states ($n=2$), but the greater shielding in the 2s orbital completely cancels the nuclear charge experienced by the electron, nullifying the interaction.\n\nD. The magnetic quantum number, $m_l$, is always zero for any electron in a 2s orbital, whereas for a 2p orbital, $m_l$ can be non-zero. Spin-orbit coupling is only possible for states with non-zero $m_l$.\n\nE. In the ground state, the two electrons in the 1s orbital have anti-aligned spins, creating a net zero magnetic field that cancels any potential interaction for the 2s electron. In the excited state, this cancellation is broken.", "solution": "The problem asks for the physical reason why the valence electron in a lithium atom experiences no first-order spin-orbit coupling in its ground state ($1s^2 2s^1$) but does experience it in an excited state ($1s^2 2p^1$). The solution involves analyzing the quantum numbers that govern the spin-orbit interaction for the valence electron in each case.\n\nThe spin-orbit coupling energy, $E_{SO}$, is proportional to the dot product of the electron's orbital angular momentum vector, $\\mathbf{L}$, and its spin angular momentum vector, $\\mathbf{S}$.\n$$E_{SO} \\propto \\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{S}$$\nFor this interaction energy to be non-zero, both the orbital angular momentum and the spin angular momentum must be non-zero.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of the valence electron in the two specified states.\n\nFirst, consider the ground state of lithium, where the valence electron is in a 2s orbital ($2s^1$).\nThe orbital an electron occupies determines its orbital angular momentum. The magnitude of the orbital angular momentum vector, $|\\mathbf{L}|$, is given by the formula:\n$$|\\mathbf{L}| = \\hbar\\sqrt{l(l+1)}$$\nwhere $l$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number (also known as the azimuthal quantum number). For an s-orbital, the value of $l$ is 0.\nSubstituting $l=0$ into the formula for $|\\mathbf{L}|$:\n$$|\\mathbf{L}| = \\hbar\\sqrt{0(0+1)} = 0$$\nSince the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum is zero, the vector $\\mathbf{L}$ is the zero vector. Therefore, the dot product $\\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{S}$ is also zero, regardless of the value of $\\mathbf{S}$.\n$$\\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{S} = 0$$\nThis means that for an electron in any s-orbital, there is no orbital angular momentum for its spin to couple with, and thus the first-order spin-orbit coupling energy is zero.\n\nNext, consider the excited state of lithium, where the valence electron is in a 2p orbital ($2p^1$).\nFor a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ is 1.\nSubstituting $l=1$ into the formula for $|\\mathbf{L}|$:\n$$|\\mathbf{L}| = \\hbar\\sqrt{1(1+1)} = \\hbar\\sqrt{2}$$\nThis is a non-zero value.\nAn electron always possesses intrinsic spin angular momentum, characterized by the spin quantum number $s = 1/2$. The magnitude of the spin angular momentum vector, $|\\mathbf{S}|$, is:\n$$|\\mathbf{S}| = \\hbar\\sqrt{s(s+1)} = \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right)} = \\hbar\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nThis is also a non-zero value. Since both $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$ are non-zero vectors for an electron in a p-orbital, their dot product $\\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{S}$ is not necessarily zero. The interaction is present, leading to a non-zero spin-orbit coupling energy correction.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nA. This statement correctly identifies that for the 2s orbital, $l=0$, leading to zero orbital angular momentum and hence no coupling. It also correctly states that for the 2p orbital, $l=1$, which allows for a non-zero interaction. This aligns perfectly with our analysis.\nB. This statement is incorrect. An electron is a fermion and always has a spin quantum number $s=1/2$, regardless of which orbital it occupies. The spin is an intrinsic property.\nC. This statement is incorrect. While shielding affects the effective nuclear charge and the overall energy of the orbital, it does not nullify the orbital angular momentum, which is the key factor for spin-orbit coupling. The fundamental reason for the absence of coupling is related to angular momentum ($l=0$), not the magnitude of the nuclear charge.\nD. This statement is subtly incorrect. It correctly states that $m_l=0$ for a 2s orbital. However, it incorrectly implies that coupling is only possible for non-zero $m_l$. For a p-orbital ($l=1$), the possible values of $m_l$ are -1, 0, and +1. An electron in a p-orbital with $m_l=0$ still experiences spin-orbit coupling because the total orbital angular momentum (determined by $l=1$) is non-zero. The quantum number $m_l$ describes the projection of the angular momentum vector, not its magnitude. The coupling depends on the entire vectors $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$, not just one of their components.\nE. This statement is incorrect. It confuses spin-orbit coupling, which is an intra-electron effect (interaction between a single electron's own spin and its own orbital motion), with inter-electron effects like electron-electron repulsion or magnetic interactions between different electrons. The state of the core electrons in the 1s orbital does not turn off the spin-orbit coupling for the valence electron.\n\nTherefore, the only correct physical justification among the choices is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2289235"}, {"introduction": "When spin-orbit coupling is active, a single electronic term, described by quantum numbers $L$ and $S$, splits into multiple distinct energy levels.
