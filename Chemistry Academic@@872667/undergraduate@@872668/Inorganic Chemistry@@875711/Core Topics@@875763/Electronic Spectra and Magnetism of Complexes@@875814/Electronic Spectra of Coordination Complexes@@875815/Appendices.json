The laser's gain medium is a sapphire crystal (crystalline aluminum oxide, $Al_2O_3$) doped with a small amount of titanium(III) ions, $Ti^{3+}$. The $Ti^{3+}$ ions substitute for some of the $Al^{3+}$ ions in the crystal lattice, placing them in an approximately octahedral coordination environment of oxide ions. This substitution is responsible for the crystal's ability to absorb pump light and lase. Spectroscopic analysis of a Ti-sapphire crystal reveals a broad absorption band in the visible region with a maximum at a wavelength of 497 nm.
