The compound exhibits a phenomenon known as spin crossover, where its electronic structure changes as a function of temperature. At temperatures below its transition point, the central iron(III) ion, which has a d⁵ electron configuration, is stabilized in its low-spin state. To characterize the magnetic properties of this low-temperature phase, it is necessary to predict its theoretical magnetic moment.\n\nCalculate the theoretical spin-only magnetic moment ($\\mu_{so}$) for the iron(III) complex in its low-spin state.

The iron(III) ion is specified as having a d⁵ electron configuration.\n\nThe first step is to determine the number of unpaired electrons, denoted by $n$, in a low-spin d⁵ complex. In coordination chemistry, the d orbitals of a central metal ion are split into different energy levels by the surrounding ligands. For a typical octahedral geometry, these orbitals split into a lower-energy set of three orbitals (the $t_{2g}$ set) and a higher-energy set of two orbitals (the $e_g$ set).\n\nThe term \"d⁵\" signifies that there are five electrons to be placed in these d orbitals. The term \"low-spin\" indicates that the crystal field splitting energy is large enough to overcome the electron-electron repulsion energy required to pair electrons in the same orbital. Therefore, electrons will fill the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals completely before any electrons occupy the higher-energy $e_g$ orbitals.\n\nWe fill the orbitals for the d⁵ configuration as follows:\n1.  The first electron goes into one of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n2.  The second electron goes into another $t_{2g}$ orbital.\n3.  The third electron goes into the last empty $t_{2g}$ orbital. At this point, all three $t_{2g}$ orbitals are singly occupied.\n4.  The fourth electron pairs up with an electron in one of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n5.  The fifth electron pairs up with an electron in another of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n\nThe resulting electronic configuration is $(t_{2g})^5(e_g)^0$. Visually, this can be represented as:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ne_g:  \\underline{\\hspace{0.5cm}} \\hspace{0.5cm} \\underline{\\hspace{0.5cm}} \\\\\nt_{2g}:  \\underline{\\uparrow\\downarrow} \\hspace{0.5cm} \\underline{\\uparrow\\downarrow} \\hspace{0.5cm} \\underline{\\uparrow}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nBy counting the electrons without a pair, we find that there is only one unpaired electron. Thus, $n = 1$.\n\nThe next step is to use the spin-only formula to calculate the magnetic moment, $\\mu_{so}$. This formula is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_{so} = \\sqrt{n(n+2)}\n$$\nwhere the result is in units of Bohr magnetons ($\\mu_B$).\n\nSubstituting the value $n = 1$ into the formula:\n$$\n\\mu_{so} = \\sqrt{1(1+2)} = \\sqrt{1(3)} = \\sqrt{3} \\hspace{0.2cm} \\mu_B\n$$\n\nFinally, we need to provide a numerical answer rounded to three significant figures. The value of $\\sqrt{3}$ is approximately $1.7320508...$.

If the molar standard Gibbs free energy difference is defined as $\\Delta G^{0}(T)=\\Delta H - T\\Delta S$ with $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$ being the enthalpy and entropy differences (HS relative to LS), then in the absence of intermolecular interactions (i.e., for isolated molecules), the equilibrium constant is\n$$\nK(T)=\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{0}(T)}{R T}\\right)=\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H - T\\Delta S}{R T}\\right).\n$$\nThe high-spin mole fraction is then\n$$\n\\chi_{HS}(T)=\\frac{K(T)}{1+K(T)}=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G^{0}(T)}{R T}\\right)}=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Delta H - T\\Delta S}{R T}\\right)}.\n$$\nThis is a smooth, sigmoidal function of $T$, with no thermal hysteresis, because $\\chi_{HS}$ is determined by a unique equilibrium condition that depends only on $T$ through a state function.\n\nIn a crystal, however, spin crossover is typically cooperative due to elastic and other intermolecular interactions.
