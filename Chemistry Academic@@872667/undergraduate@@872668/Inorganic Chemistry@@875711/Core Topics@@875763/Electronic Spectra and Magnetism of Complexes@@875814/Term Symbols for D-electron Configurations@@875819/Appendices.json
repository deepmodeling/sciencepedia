A neutral titanium atom (Ti) has an atomic number of $Z=22$, so it has 22 electrons. Its ground state electron configuration is $[Ar] 3d^{2} 4s^{2}$. The Ti$^{2+}$ ion is formed by removing the two electrons with the highest principal quantum number, which are the 4s electrons. Therefore, the electron configuration of Ti$^{2+}$ is $[Ar] 3d^{2}$. We need to find the term symbol for the two electrons in the 3d subshell.\n\nThe determination of the ground state term symbol ${}^{2S+1}L_J$ involves applying Hund's rules in order:\n1.  Maximize the total spin quantum number, $S$.\n2.  For a given $S$, maximize the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, $L$.\n3.  For a given $S$ and $L$, determine the total angular momentum quantum number, $J$.\n\n**Step 1: Maximize Total Spin (S)**\nThe d-subshell has five orbitals, with magnetic orbital quantum numbers ($m_l$) of $-2, -1, 0, +1,$ and $+2$. According to Hund's first rule, the state of lowest energy is the one with the maximum total spin $S$. To achieve this, the two 3d electrons must occupy different orbitals and have parallel spins.\nLet's place the two electrons with parallel spins ($m_s = +1/2$ for each). The total spin quantum number is the sum of the individual spin quantum numbers:\n$S = \\sum m_s = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$\nThe spin multiplicity is given by $2S+1$:\n$2S+1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$\nThis means the ground state is a triplet state. This immediately eliminates options B (${}^1\\text{G}_4$) and E (${}^1\\text{D}_2$), as they are singlet states (multiplicity of 1).\n\n**Step 2: Maximize Total Orbital Angular Momentum (L)**\nAccording to Hund's second rule, for a given spin multiplicity, the state with the highest total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$ is the most stable. To maximize $L$, we must place the two unpaired electrons in the orbitals with the highest possible $m_l$ values. The available $m_l$ values are $+2, +1, 0, -1, -2$. We place one electron in the $m_l = +2$ orbital and the other in the $m_l = +1$ orbital.\nThe total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$ is the sum of the absolute values of the individual $m_l$ values for the chosen configuration:\n$L = \\left| \\sum m_l \\right| = |(+2) + (+1)| = 3$\nThe letter code corresponding to $L=3$ is 'F'. Therefore, the ground state term is ${}^3\\text{F}$. This eliminates option C (${}^3\\text{P}_0$), which corresponds to $L=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine Total Angular Momentum (J)**\nHund's third rule helps us determine the value of the total angular momentum quantum number, $J$. The possible values for $J$ range from $|L-S|$ to $L+S$ in integer steps.\nWith $L=3$ and $S=1$, the possible $J$ values are:\n$J = |3-1|, \\dots, 3+1$\n$J = 2, 3, 4$\nThe rule for selecting the ground state $J$ value depends on the occupancy of the subshell. The 3d subshell can hold a maximum of 10 electrons. Since the Ti$^{2+}$ ion has a 3d$^2$ configuration, the subshell is less than half-filled. For subshells that are less than half-filled, the ground state level is the one with the minimum $J$ value.\nThe minimum value among the possible $J$ values (2, 3, 4) is $J=2$.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Term Symbol**\nCombining the multiplicity ($2S+1=3$), the orbital angular momentum letter (F), and the total angular momentum ($J=2$), we obtain the full ground state term symbol ${}^{2S+1}L_J = {}^3\\text{F}_2$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option D.
