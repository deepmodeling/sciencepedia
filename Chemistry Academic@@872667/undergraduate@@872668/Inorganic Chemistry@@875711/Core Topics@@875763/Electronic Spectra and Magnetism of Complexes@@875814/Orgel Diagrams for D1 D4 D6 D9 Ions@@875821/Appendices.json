Consider the high-spin aqueous complexes of iron(II), $[Fe(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$, and manganese(III), $[Mn(H_2O)_6]^{3+}$. For both complexes, the free-ion ground state is a quintet D term ($^5D$).

The ground state symmetry cannot be determined without knowing the ligand field splitting energy.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which of the two high-spin octahedral complexes, $[Fe(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$ and $[Mn(H_2O)_6]^{3+}$, has a ground state with $T_{2g}$ symmetry.\n\nFirst, we must determine the d-electron count for each metal ion.\n- Iron (Fe) is in Group 8 of the periodic table, so a neutral Fe atom has an electron configuration of $[Ar] 3d^6 4s^2$. The iron(II) ion, $Fe^{2+}$, has lost two electrons, resulting in a configuration of $[Ar] 3d^6$. So, $Fe^{2+}$ is a $d^6$ ion.\n- Manganese (Mn) is in Group 7, with a neutral atomic configuration of $[Ar] 3d^5 4s^2$. The manganese(III) ion, $Mn^{3+}$, has lost three electrons, resulting in a configuration of $[Ar] 3d^4$. So, $Mn^{3+}$ is a $d^4$ ion.\n\nBoth complexes are specified as high-spin and octahedral. In an octahedral ligand field, the five d-orbitals split into a lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set (three orbitals) and a higher-energy $e_g$ set (two orbitals).\n\nFor the $d^4$ high-spin case ($Mn^{3+}$), the four d-electrons are arranged to maximize spin multiplicity. This gives the configuration $(t_{2g})^3(e_g)^1$.\nFor the $d^6$ high-spin case ($Fe^{2+}$), the six d-electrons are arranged as $(t_{2g})^4(e_g)^2$.\n\nThe splitting of free-ion terms in a ligand field can be visualized using Orgel diagrams. The $D$ free-ion term splits into a $T_{2g}$ state and an $E_g$ state in an octahedral field. The relative energies of these states depend on the d-electron configuration.\n\nA useful principle is the \"hole formalism\" or the $d^n \\leftrightarrow d^{10-n}$ correspondence. An Orgel diagram for a $d^n$ configuration is inverted relative to a $d^{10-n}$ configuration.\nAnother useful relation is that for high-spin complexes, the diagram for a $d^{n+5}$ configuration is the same as for a $d^n$ configuration.\n\nLet's analyze the $d^4$ case ($Mn^{3+}$):\nThe $d^4$ configuration can be related to the $d^1$ configuration. A $d^1$ ion, such as $Ti^{3+}$, has the configuration $(t_{2g})^1(e_g)^0$. The single electron occupies a lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbital. Therefore, the ground state for a $d^1$ ion in an octahedral field is $T_{2g}$, and the excited state (from promoting the electron to an $e_g$ orbital) is $E_g$.\nThe Orgel diagram for a $d^4$ configuration is inverted compared to the $d^1$ diagram. This means the energy ordering of the states is reversed.\n- For $d^1$: Ground state is $T_{2g}$, Excited state is $E_g$.\n- For $d^4$: Ground state is $E_g$, Excited state is $T_{2g}$.\nTherefore, the ground state for the high-spin $d^4$ complex $[Mn(H_2O)_6]^{3+}$ has $E_g$ symmetry. The complete ground state term is $^5E_g$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the $d^6$ case ($Fe^{2+}$):\nUsing the $d^{n+5}$ relationship, the Orgel diagram for a high-spin $d^6$ configuration is the same as for a $d^1$ configuration.\n- For $d^1$: Ground state is $T_{2g}$.\n- For high-spin $d^6$: Ground state is $T_{2g}$.\nAlternatively, we can use the hole formalism. A high-spin $d^6$ configuration, $(t_{2g})^4(e_g)^2$, can be seen as having one hole in the half-filled $t_{2g}$ levels and one electron past the half-filled $e_g$ levels. More simply, it can be viewed as one electron added to a stable high-spin $d^5$ configuration, $(t_{2g})^3(e_g)^2$. This extra sixth electron goes into the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set, pairing up with an existing electron. The configuration $(t_{2g})^4(e_g)^2$ has an orbital degeneracy in the $t_{2g}$ set (one vacancy distributed over three orbitals), leading to a T term. Because the orbital degeneracy arises from the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals, the ground state is a $T_{2g}$ state.\nTherefore, the ground state for the high-spin $d^6$ complex $[Fe(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$ has $T_{2g}$ symmetry. The complete ground state term is $^5T_{2g}$.\n\nConclusion:\n- $[Mn(H_2O)_6]^{3+}$ ($d^4$ high-spin) has an $E_g$ ground state.\n- $[Fe(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$ ($d^6$ high-spin) has a $T_{2g}$ ground state.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA.

By combining the hole formalism with the principle of ligand field inversion between octahedral and tetrahedral environments, you can uncover non-obvious equivalences. This problem demonstrates the elegance and predictive power of symmetry arguments, revealing how the Orgel diagram for a $d^1$ octahedral complex is identical to that of a different tetrahedral complex [@problem_id:2276203].", "problem": "Orgel diagrams are a powerful tool in inorganic chemistry for interpreting the d-d electronic absorption spectra of high-spin transition metal complexes.

A $d^9$ tetrahedral complex", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify which high-spin tetrahedral (Td) d-electron configuration ($d^n$) has an Orgel diagram identical to that of a high-spin octahedral (Oh) $d^1$ complex. To solve this, we need to understand how Orgel diagrams are related across different electron counts and geometries.\n\nThere are two fundamental relationships that govern Orgel diagrams:\n\n1.  **Hole Formalism within the same geometry**: The Orgel diagram for a $d^{10-n}$ configuration is the inverse of the diagram for a $d^n$ configuration in the *same* geometry. For example, the diagram for a $d^9$ Oh complex is an inverted version of the diagram for a $d^1$ Oh complex. This is because the free-ion term for both is a $D$ term, but the single electron in $d^1$ occupies a low-energy orbital, while the single hole in $d^9$ occupies a high-energy orbital, leading to an inversion of the ground and excited states.\n\n2.  **Geometry Inversion for the same electron count**: The energy splitting of d-orbitals in a tetrahedral field is the inverse of the splitting in an octahedral field. Consequently, the Orgel diagram for a $d^n$ Td complex is the inverse of the diagram for a $d^n$ Oh complex.\n\nCombining these two principles gives us a powerful shortcut. We are looking for a $d^n$ Td complex whose diagram is identical to a $d^1$ Oh complex.\n\nLet's start with the $d^1$ Oh diagram. We want to find a $d^n$ Td diagram that is identical to it.\nUsing rule #2, the diagram for a $d^n$ Td complex is the *inverse* of the diagram for a $d^n$ Oh complex.\nSo, our target $d^n$ Td diagram is equivalent to an *(inverted $d^n$ Oh diagram)*.\n\nWe want this *(inverted $d^n$ Oh diagram)* to be identical to the *(d$^1$ Oh diagram)*.\n\nNow, let's use rule #1. The diagram for a $d^{10-n}$ Oh complex is the *inverse* of the diagram for a $d^n$ Oh complex.\nThis means an *(inverted $d^n$ Oh diagram)* is identical to a *($d^{10-n}$ Oh diagram)*.\n\nBy combining these statements, we find that the *(d$^1$ Oh diagram)* must be identical to the *($d^{10-n}$ Oh diagram)*. This can only be true if the electron counts are the same.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$$1 = 10 - n$$\nSolving this equation for $n$:\n$$n = 10 - 1 = 9$$\n\nThis result tells us that a $d^9$ tetrahedral complex has an Orgel diagram that is identical to a $d^1$ octahedral complex.\n\nLet's verify this using term symbols.\n-   **$d^1$ Octahedral (Oh)**: The free-ion ground term is $^2D$. In an octahedral field, the d-orbitals split into a lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set and a higher-energy $e_g$ set. The single electron resides in a $t_{2g}$ orbital, so the ground state is $^2T_{2g}$. The only possible d-d electronic transition promotes this electron to the $e_g$ set, resulting in the excited state $^2E_g$. The Orgel diagram shows a single transition from a $^2T_{2g}$ ground state to a $^2E_g$ excited state.\n\n-   **$d^9$ Tetrahedral (Td)**: The free-ion ground term is also $^2D$. In a tetrahedral field, the d-orbitals split into a lower-energy $e$ set and a higher-energy $t_2$ set. The electron configuration is $e^4t_2^5$. This configuration has a single \"hole\" in the higher-energy $t_2$ orbitals. The term symbol for a single hole in a set of orbitals is the same as for a single electron in that same set of orbitals. Therefore, the ground state for a $d^9$ Td complex is $^2T_2$. An electronic transition involves promoting an electron from the filled $e$ set to fill the hole in the $t_2$ set. This is equivalent to moving the hole from the $t_2$ orbitals to the $e$ orbitals. The resulting excited state is $^2E$. The Orgel diagram thus shows a single transition from a $^2T_2$ ground state to a $^2E$ excited state.\n\nComparing the two cases (ignoring the g/u subscripts which are not relevant for tetrahedral geometry), both have a $^2T$ ground state and a $^2E$ excited state. Their Orgel diagrams are therefore identical.\n\nThus, a $d^9$ tetrahedral complex corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2276203"}]}
