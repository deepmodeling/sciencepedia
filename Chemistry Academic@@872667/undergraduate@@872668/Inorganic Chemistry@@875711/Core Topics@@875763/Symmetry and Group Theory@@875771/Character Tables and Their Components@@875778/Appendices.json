When molecular orbitals are found to have the same energy, is this a coincidence or a fundamental consequence of the molecule's shape?

For the purpose of a simplified symmetry analysis, the molecule is assumed to possess a perfect $D_{4h}$ point group symmetry. The results of a quantum mechanical calculation provide the energies and symmetry properties of the molecular orbitals. Two specific findings near the frontier orbital region are of particular interest:\n\n1.  **Observation 1:** A pair of molecular orbitals, which we can label $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$, are found to be exactly degenerate at an energy $E_1$. A detailed symmetry analysis of the calculation output confirms that these two orbitals, as a pair, form a basis for the $E_u$ irreducible representation of the $D_{4h}$ point group.\n\n2.  **Observation 2:** Another pair of molecular orbitals, $\\psi_3$ and $\\psi_4$, are also found to be exactly degenerate at a different energy $E_2$. The symmetry analysis for these orbitals indicates that $\\psi_3$ transforms according to the $A_{2u}$ irreducible representation, while $\\psi_4$ transforms according to the $B_{2u}$ irreducible representation.\n\nBased on the principles of group theory and its application to molecular orbitals, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete description of the nature of the degeneracies in Observation 1 and Observation 2?\n\nA. Both degeneracies are required by symmetry. The existence of multiple orbitals at the same energy in a high-symmetry molecule is always a consequence of that symmetry.\n\nB.

The degeneracy in Observation 2 is also required by symmetry because the $A_{2u}$ and $B_{2u}$ representations have the same character under the identity operation.\n\nF.

Symmetry invariance implies $[H,\\hat{R}(g)]=0$ for all $g \\in G$, where $\\hat{R}(g)$ is the unitary operator representing $g$. In a basis adapted to the irreducible representations (irreps) of $G$, the Hilbert space decomposes into invariant subspaces carrying irreps $\\mu$ of dimensions $d_{\\mu}$. By Schur’s lemma, on each irreducible subspace the restriction of $H$ is proportional to the identity:\n$$\nH|_{\\mu} = \\lambda_{\\mu} I_{d_{\\mu}}.\n$$\nTherefore, all states spanning a single irrep $\\mu$ are exactly $d_{\\mu}$-fold degenerate. This is symmetry-required degeneracy and depends only on the irrep dimension, not on parity (gerade/ungerade) or on any other detail.\n\nApply this to the two observations:\n\n1) Observation 1: The pair $\\{\\psi_1,\\psi_2\\}$ forms a basis for the $E_u$ irrep of $D_{4h}$. In $D_{4h}$, $E_u$ is a two-dimensional irrep, so $d_{E_u}=2$. By the argument above,\n$$\nH|_{E_u} = \\lambda_{E_u} I_2,\n$$\nwhich enforces a twofold degeneracy. Hence the degeneracy of $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$ at energy $E_1$ is required by symmetry.\n\n2) Observation 2: The orbitals transform as $A_{2u}$ and $B_{2u}$, which are distinct one-dimensional irreps, so $d_{A_{2u}}=1$ and $d_{B_{2u}}=1$. The block-diagonal form of $H$ is\n$$\nH|_{A_{2u}} = \\lambda_{A_{2u}},\\quad H|_{B_{2u}} = \\lambda_{B_{2u}},\n$$\nwith no symmetry constraint relating $\\lambda_{A_{2u}}$ and $\\lambda_{B_{2u}}$. Since they belong to different irreps, the energies can vary independently under any perturbation that preserves $D_{4h}$. Equality $E_2 = \\lambda_{A_{2u}} = \\lambda_{B_{2u}}$ is therefore not enforced by symmetry and is accidental.\n\nThese conclusions address the distractors:\n- The claim that degeneracy requires gerade parity is false; $E_u$ exhibits symmetry-required degeneracy despite ungerade parity.\n- The claim that only cubic groups have symmetry-required degeneracy is false; $D_{4h}$ has two-dimensional $E$-type irreps.\n- The fact that $A_{2u}$ and $B_{2u}$ share the same character under the identity operation is irrelevant; all one-dimensional irreps have character $1$ at the identity, but degeneracy arises within a single irrep and equals its dimension, not from matching identity characters across different irreps.\n\nTherefore, the correct assessment is that the degeneracy in Observation 1 is required by symmetry, while the degeneracy in Observation 2 is accidental.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2237942"}]}
