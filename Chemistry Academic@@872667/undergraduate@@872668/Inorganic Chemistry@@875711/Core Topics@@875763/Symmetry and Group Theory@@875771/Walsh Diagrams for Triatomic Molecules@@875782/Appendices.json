They are a powerful tool for predicting the shapes of small molecules.\n\nConsider a generic triatomic molecule of the type AH₂, where A is a central atom and H are terminal hydrogen atoms. The geometry can be either linear or bent. The key principles from the Walsh diagram for an AH₂ molecule, describing the energy changes as the H-A-H bond angle decreases from 180° (linear) to 90° (bent), are as follows:\n\n1.  In the linear ($D_{\\infty h}$ symmetry) configuration, the valence MOs, in order of increasing energy, are a bonding $\\sigma_g$ orbital, a bonding $\\sigma_u$ orbital, and a pair of degenerate non-bonding p-type orbitals on the central atom, designated as $\\pi_u$.\n2.  As the molecule bends (to $C_{2v}$ symmetry), the degeneracy of the $\\pi_u$ orbitals is lifted. One of these orbitals, which points into the H-A-H bond angle, is significantly stabilized by mixing with other orbitals of the same symmetry and is relabeled as an $a_1$ orbital.\n3.  The other $\\pi_u$ orbital, which is perpendicular to the molecular plane, remains largely non-bonding and its energy is relatively unchanged. It is relabeled as a $b_1$ orbital.\n4.  The $\\sigma_u$ orbital is destabilized upon bending and is relabeled as a $b_2$ orbital.\n5.  The lowest-energy $\\sigma_g$ orbital is typically slightly stabilized upon bending and is relabeled as an $a_1$ orbital.\n\nThe final geometry of the molecule is the one that minimizes the total electronic energy, which is determined by the sum of the energies of the occupied orbitals.\n\nUsing these principles, predict the preferred molecular geometry for the beryllium dihydride anion, $\\text{BeH}_2^-$.\n\nA.

To understand its structure and stability, one can analyze how the energies of its valence molecular orbitals (MOs) change with the H-Si-H bond angle, $\\theta$. For a generic AH₂-type molecule, the qualitative energy trends of the four lowest-energy valence MOs, as the molecule bends from a linear geometry ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$) to a right-angled geometry ($\\theta = 90^\\circ$), are described as follows:\n\n- **Orbital 1:** The energy decreases slightly.\n- **Orbital 2:** The energy increases moderately.\n- **Orbital 3:** The energy decreases sharply, showing the most significant stabilization upon bending.\n- **Orbital 4:** The energy remains approximately constant.\n\nAssume that these trends apply to the silylene molecule and that other physical effects, such as internuclear repulsion, become dominant only at very small bond angles.

Silicon contributes four valence electrons and the two hydrogens contribute two in total, so the molecule has\n$$\nN_{e}=6\n$$\nvalence electrons.

In the singlet ground state, orbitals 1, 2, and 3 are doubly occupied. The total change in electronic energy upon bending is determined by the sum of the energy changes for these occupied orbitals. According to the stated trends, upon bending from $180^\\circ$: Orbital 1 is slightly stabilized (energy decreases), Orbital 2 is moderately destabilized (energy increases), and Orbital 3 is sharply stabilized (energy decreases).\n\nThe key principle of the Walsh diagram for such molecules is that the sharp stabilization of Orbital 3 is the dominant energetic effect, outweighing the moderate destabilization of Orbital 2 and the slight stabilization of Orbital 1. Therefore, the total electronic energy will initially decrease as the molecule bends away from the linear geometry. At very small angles, however, increasing nuclear and electron-electron repulsions will cause the total energy to rise again.\n\nConsequently, the total energy is at a maximum at the linear geometry ($\\theta=180^{\\circ}$), decreases upon bending to reach a minimum at some bent angle $\\theta^{*}<180^{\\circ}$, and then rises again at sufficiently small $\\theta$.

While the standard Walsh diagram correctly predicts the bent shape of ozone, it fails for the isoelectronic trisulfur molecule. This final practice challenges you to think critically about the underlying assumptions of the model and explore why a different structural arrangement, a cyclic form, becomes the true ground state for S₃ [@problem_id:2298779].", "problem": "Walsh diagrams offer a powerful, qualitative molecular orbital approach for predicting the geometries of small molecules by tracking the energy of valence orbitals as a function of a geometric parameter, typically a bond angle. For a generic triatomic molecule of the $A_3$ type with 18 valence electrons, such as ozone ($\\text{O}_3$), the standard Walsh diagram correctly predicts a bent ground-state geometry with $C_{2v}$ symmetry, correlating with experimental observations. However, the trisulfur molecule ($\\text{S}_3$), which is isoelectronic with ozone, presents a challenge to this simple model. Experimentally, the ground state of $\\text{S}_3$ is not a bent open-chain structure but rather a cyclic, equilateral triangle structure with $D_{3h}$ symmetry.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental physical explanation for the failure of the simple linear-to-bent Walsh diagram to predict the correct ground-state geometry for $\\text{S}_3$, while it succeeds for $\\text{O}_3$?\n\nA. Sulfur's ability to utilize its vacant 3d-orbitals in bonding significantly lowers the energy of the cyclic $D_{3h}$ structure through enhanced delocalization, an effect not possible for the second-row element oxygen.\n\nB. The much higher electronegativity of oxygen atoms compared to sulfur atoms leads to stronger electrostatic interactions and lone pair-bond pair repulsions that preferentially stabilize the bent $C_{2v}$ structure. For the less electronegative sulfur atoms, these effects are weaker, allowing the more symmetric cyclic structure to prevail.\n\nC. The standard Walsh diagram is fundamentally limited as it only compares the relative energies of linear versus bent open-chain geometries. It fails to consider the cyclic $D_{3h}$ topology, which for $\\text{S}_3$ is exceptionally stabilized by a delocalized aromatic $\\pi$-electron system. This aromatic stabilization, coupled with reduced ring strain due to sulfur's larger atomic size and longer bonds, renders the cyclic form more stable than the bent isomer.\n\nD. The energy stabilization gained by bending from a linear geometry is primarily due to the mixing of s- and p-type orbitals. Because the 3s-3p energy gap in sulfur is much smaller than the 2s-2p gap in oxygen, this mixing is far more effective for $\\text{S}_3$, leading to an unstable, highly reactive bent molecule that spontaneously rearranges to the more inert cyclic form.\n\nE. The simple Walsh diagram implicitly assumes a singlet electronic ground state. While this is true for bent $\\text{O}_3$, the cyclic $D_{3h}$ structure observed for $\\text{S}_3$ is actually a thermally accessible, high-spin triplet excited state. The true ground state of $\\text{S}_3$ is indeed bent, but it is difficult to isolate experimentally.", "solution": "Walsh diagrams for triatomic $A_3$ molecules track the energies of valence molecular orbitals as a function of a bending angle for an open-chain topology, comparing linear versus bent geometries of the same connectivity. This model successfully rationalizes the bent ground state of $\\text{O}_3$ with $C_{2v}$ symmetry because, along the linear-to-bent coordinate, the occupied orbitals are stabilized upon bending as expected for a second-row, open-chain system, and no lower-energy topology is introduced within the model.\n\nFor $\\text{S}_3$, the simple Walsh approach fails because it does not include alternative topologies. The experimentally observed ground state is a planar equilateral ring with $D_{3h}$ symmetry, which introduces a qualitatively different set of molecular orbitals owing to cyclic conjugation. In a $D_{3h}$ triangle, the three out-of-plane $p$ orbitals (one on each S) form a cyclic $\\pi$ system with three symmetry-adapted combinations that, in Hückel theory, have energies\n$$\nE_{k}=\\alpha+2\\beta\\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{3}\\right),\\quad k=0,\\pm 1,\n$$\ni.e., one bonding level at $\\alpha+2\\beta$ and a doubly degenerate higher level at $\\alpha-\\beta$. In $D_{3h}$ notation, these correspond to $a_{2}''$ (bonding) and $e''$ (higher energy). Crucially, because sulfur possesses low-lying in-plane lone-pair orbitals, the electron occupancy can avoid placing electrons into the higher-energy $e''$ $\\pi$ set: only the lowest $a_{2}''$ $\\pi$ MO is filled with $2$ electrons, while the remaining valence electrons reside in nonbonding orbitals that are lower in energy than the $e''$ $\\pi$ set. Therefore, the cyclic $\\pi$ system of $\\text{S}_3$ effectively contains $2$ delocalized $\\pi$ electrons, satisfying the $4n+2$ condition with $n=0$, and gains aromatic stabilization relative to an open-chain arrangement.\n\nThe standard Walsh diagram, constrained to linear-to-bent open-chain geometries, cannot capture this topological reorganization and its associated delocalization energy. In addition, sulfur’s larger covalent radius and longer S–S bonds reduce ring strain in a three-membered ring compared to an $\\text{O}_3$ triangle, further favoring the $D_{3h}$ cyclic structure for $\\text{S}_3$ while strongly disfavoring a triangular $\\text{O}_3$. Thus, for $\\text{O}_3$, the lowest-energy structure along the open-chain bending coordinate remains bent $C_{2v}$, and no competing cyclic topology is favorable; for $\\text{S}_3$, a cyclic topology outside the Walsh path is stabilized by delocalization and reduced strain, making it the true ground state.\n\nWith this framework, the options evaluate as follows:\n- A is not fundamental; 3d-orbital participation in main-group bonding is negligible for sulfur in this context and does not provide the primary stabilization.\n- B is qualitative but does not address the central failure: omission of the cyclic topology and associated delocalization; electronegativity differences alone do not predict the $D_{3h}$ ground state.\n- C correctly identifies the limitation of the Walsh diagram (topology constraint) and the key stabilizations for $\\text{S}_3$: cyclic delocalization consistent with a $2$-electron $\\pi$ aromatic system and reduced ring strain for sulfur.\n- D misattributes the effect to s–p mixing and contradicts the rationale of Walsh stabilization; it neither explains nor justifies a spontaneous rearrangement to the ring on that basis.\n- E is factually incorrect; $\\text{S}_3$ has a singlet ground state in the $D_{3h}$ geometry, not a high-spin excited state.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that the simple Walsh diagram omits the cyclic $D_{3h}$ topology whose aromatic delocalization and reduced ring strain uniquely stabilize $\\text{S}_3$ relative to the bent open-chain isomer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2298779"}]}
