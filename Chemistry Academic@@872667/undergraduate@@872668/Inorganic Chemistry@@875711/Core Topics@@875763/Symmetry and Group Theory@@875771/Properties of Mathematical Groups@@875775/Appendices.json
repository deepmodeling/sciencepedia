Consider a hypothetical planar molecule belonging to the $D_{7h}$ point group. The symmetry operations of this group include the identity operation ($E$), a principal seven-fold rotation axis ($C_7$), and a horizontal mirror plane ($\\sigma_h$) perpendicular to the $C_7$ axis.\n\nLet's examine a specific subset of these operations, defined as $G = \\{E, C_7, \\sigma_h\\}$. Determine if this set $G$, under the operation of sequential application (composition), forms a mathematical group.

No, because the set $G$ is not closed under the operation.\nE. No, because the associative property is not satisfied for the operations in $G$.", "solution": "We recall the group axioms for a set under composition: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses. For symmetry operations of a molecule, the binary operation is sequential application (composition) of operations.\n\n1) Associativity: Composition of mappings is associative in general. Therefore, for any symmetry operations $a,b,c$, one has $(a \\circ b) \\circ c = a \\circ (b \\circ c)$. Hence associativity holds automatically for any subset of symmetry operations under composition.\n\n2) Identity: The identity operation $E$ is explicitly included in $G = \\{E, C_{7}, \\sigma_{h}\\}$. Therefore, the identity axiom is satisfied.\n\n3) Closure: To test closure, it is sufficient to find whether the composition of any two elements in $G$ always remains in $G$. Consider the composition of the horizontal mirror and the seven-fold rotation about the principal axis. Let the principal axis be the $z$-axis, so $C_{7}$ is rotation by angle $2\\pi/7$ about $z$, and $\\sigma_{h}$ is reflection through the plane perpendicular to $z$. By definition of an improper rotation, the composition\n$$\n\\sigma_{h} \\circ C_{7}\n$$\nis an improper rotation consisting of a rotation by $2\\pi/7$ followed by reflection through the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. This is the $S_{7}$ operation. In $D_{7h}$, $S_{7}$ is an element of the full point group, but $S_{7} \\notin G$ because $G$ has only $\\{E, C_{7}, \\sigma_{h}\\}$. Therefore, the set $G$ is not closed under composition:\n$$\n\\sigma_{h} \\circ C_{7} = S_{7} \\notin G.\n$$\nSince closure fails, $G$ cannot be a group.\n\n4) Inverses (additional confirmation): Even independently of closure above, the inverse of $C_{7}$ is $C_{7}^{-1} = C_{7}^{6}$, and $C_{7}^{6} \\notin G$. Thus the inverse axiom also fails. However, the failure of closure already suffices to conclude $G$ is not a group.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that $G$ does not form a group because it is not closed under the operation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2284762"}, {"introduction": "The behavior of any finite group can be completely captured in a group multiplication table, which details the result of combining any two elements.
