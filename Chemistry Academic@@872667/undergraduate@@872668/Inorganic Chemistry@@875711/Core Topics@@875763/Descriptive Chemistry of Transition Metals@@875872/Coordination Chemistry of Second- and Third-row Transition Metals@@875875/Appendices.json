Each $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ is a neutral ligand, and the three $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ serve as counterions; therefore the coordination entity is $[\\mathrm{Ru}(\\mathrm{NH}_3)_6]^{3+}$. Hence the oxidation state of ruthenium in the complex is $+3$.\n\nRuthenium has atomic number $44$ with a ground-state configuration approximated by $[\\mathrm{Kr}]\\,4d^{7}5s^{1}$. Forming $\\mathrm{Ru}^{3+}$ removes first the $5s$ electron and then two $4d$ electrons, giving a $4d^{5}$ configuration. Thus the metal center is a $d^{5}$ ion.\n\nThe coordination number is $6$, and the standard geometry for such ammine complexes is octahedral. In an octahedral crystal field, the $d$ orbitals split into lower-energy $t_{2g}$ and higher-energy $e_{g}$ sets with splitting $\\Delta_{o}$. For second-row transition metals (4d series), $\\Delta_{o}$ is relatively large and the pairing energy is relatively small, so octahedral complexes are typically low spin even with intermediate-to-strong field ligands such as $\\mathrm{NH}_3$. Therefore, for $d^{5}$ in a low-spin octahedral field, all five electrons occupy the $t_{2g}$ set before any enter $e_{g}$, yielding the configuration $t_{2g}^{5}e_{g}^{0}$.\n\nFilling $t_{2g}$ with five electrons gives the occupancy pattern $(2,2,1)$ across the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals, which contains exactly one unpaired electron.
