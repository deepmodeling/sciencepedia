This immediately classifies Complex A as kinetically inert and Complex B as kinetically labile in the classical inorganic-chemistry sense.\n\nTo relate these kinetic observations to activation energies, we use standard rate theories.\n\nFirst, for a first-order substitution (typical of dissociative or interchange mechanisms in octahedral complexes), the half-life is related to the rate constant by\n$$\nt_{1/2}=\\frac{\\ln 2}{k}.\n$$\nFrom the experimental statement, $t_{1/2,A}\\gg t_{1/2,B}$, which implies\n$$\nk_{A}\\ll k_{B}.\n$$\n\nSecond, by the Arrhenius equation, the temperature dependence of the rate constant is\n$$\nk = A \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_{a}$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

For reactions of the same type under identical conditions, $A_{A}$ and $A_{B}$ are typically of comparable magnitude; therefore the inequality must be driven primarily by the exponential term, which requires\n$$\nE_{a,A} > E_{a,B}.\n$$\nThis conclusion is consistent with the definitions: kinetically inert complexes have larger activation barriers to substitution, whereas kinetically labile complexes have smaller activation barriers. Thus, Complex A (inert) has a higher activation energy than Complex B (labile).\n\nFor completeness, note that statements appealing to thermodynamic stability (options D and E) are incorrect here: thermodynamic stability pertains to the reaction free energy change $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, whereas the rate is governed by the activation barrier (Arrhenius $E_{a}$ or, in transition state theory, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$). The rate data given do not determine relative thermodynamic stabilities, and thermodynamic stability does not dictate the rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct relation is $E_{a,A} > E_{a,B}$ because Complex A is kinetically inert and Complex B is kinetically labile.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2259707"}, {"introduction": "With a clear kinetic definition established, we can now explore how to predict lability based on fundamental ionic properties.

The most accurate ligand field rationale must consider how the Ligand Field Stabilization Energy (LFSE) changes when the coordination number drops from six to five.\n\n1) Octahedral ground-state LFSEs.\n\nIn an octahedral field, the $d$ orbitals split into $t_{2g}$ (lower) and $e_{g}$ (upper) with energies $-0.4\\Delta_{o}$ and $+0.6\\Delta_{o}$, respectively. Thus, for an electron configuration $t_{2g}^{n_{t}}e_{g}^{n_{e}}$, the octahedral LFSE is\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}=( -0.4\\Delta_{o})\\,n_{t} + ( +0.6\\Delta_{o})\\,n_{e}.\n$$\nFor $d^{3}$ (Complex A): $n_{t}=3$, $n_{e}=0$, so\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{3})=3(-0.4\\Delta_{o})=-1.2\\Delta_{o}.\n$$\nFor $d^{8}$ (Complex B): $n_{t}=6$, $n_{e}=2$, so\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{8})=6(-0.4\\Delta_{o})+2(+0.6\\Delta_{o})=-2.4\\Delta_{o}+1.2\\Delta_{o}=-1.2\\Delta_{o}.\n$$\nTherefore, both have the same octahedral ground-state LFSE:\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{3})=\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{8})=-1.2\\Delta_{o}.\n$$\nThis directly invalidates any claim that one is more labile solely because its octahedral ground state is less stabilized (option A), and shows that equal ground-state LFSE alone does not ensure similar lability (option B), because the mechanism depends on the five-coordinate transition state.\n\n2) Dissociative mechanism and LFSE change upon forming a five-coordinate transition state.\n\nFor a dissociative (D) pathway, the activation barrier contains a ligand-field contribution that is governed by the LFSE change upon losing one ligand to form the five-coordinate transition state (5C-TS). Define\n$$\n\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{LFSE}}=\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{5C}}-\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}.\n$$\nA smaller or more negative $\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{LFSE}}$ lowers the barrier and increases lability; a larger positive value raises the barrier and decreases lability.\n\nThe five-coordinate transition state for octahedral dissociation is commonly square pyramidal (SP) when a ligand dissociates, although trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) is also possible. The qualitative ligand field splittings are:\n- In SP, $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ is highest; $d_{z^{2}}$ is lowered relative to its octahedral $e_{g}$ energy because one axial ligand is removed; the remaining three orbitals are lower still. Thus, the strongly antibonding character associated with $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ can be left unoccupied if electron count permits.\n- In TBP, $d_{z^{2}}$ (often labeled $a_{1}^{\\prime}$) is highest; the two $e$ sets are lower. Either way, relative to the octahedral case, the net antibonding character of the $e_{g}$-derived orbitals is reduced in the five-coordinate field.\n\n3) Consequences for $d^{3}$ versus $d^{8}$ in the 5C-TS.\n\n- For $d^{3}$: In the octahedral ground state, all three electrons occupy $t_{2g}$ orbitals at $-0.4\\Delta_{o}$. Upon forming the 5C-TS, the $t_{2g}$-derived set splits and at least one electron is promoted into an orbital that is less stabilizing than $-0.4\\Delta_{o}$ (because the symmetry lowering and reduced coordination raise some of the $t_{2g}$-derived energies relative to the octahedral case). Symbolically, if the three lowest 5C orbital energies are $E_{1}$, $E_{2}$, $E_{3}$ (relative to the barycenter, with $E_{1}\\leq E_{2}\\leq E_{3}$), then\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{5C}}(d^{3})=E_{1}+E_{2}+E_{3},\n$$\nwith\n$$\nE_{1}+E_{2}+E_{3}3(-0.4\\Delta_{o})=-1.2\\Delta_{o}.\n$$\nHence\n$$\n\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{LFSE}}(d^{3})=\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{5C}}(d^{3})-\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{3})0,\n$$\ni.e., there is a loss of LFSE (an energetic penalty) upon forming the 5C-TS, which disfavors dissociation kinetically.\n\n- For $d^{8}$: In the octahedral ground state, two electrons occupy $e_{g}$ antibonding orbitals at $+0.6\\Delta_{o}$. In the SP 5C-TS, one $e_{g}$-derived orbital ($d_{z^{2}}$) is stabilized substantially relative to $+0.6\\Delta_{o}$ (call this lowering $\\delta0$), while the other ($d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$) remains strongly antibonding and can be left empty for $d^{8}$. Denote the SP energies schematically by\n$$\nE(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}})=+0.6\\Delta_{o}+\\epsilon,\\quad E(d_{z^{2}})=+0.6\\Delta_{o}-\\delta,\n$$\nwith $\\epsilon0$ and $\\delta0$, and the remaining three orbitals below. For $d^{8}$ in a strong field, the eight electrons can fully occupy the four lower-energy orbitals (including $d_{z^{2}}$) and leave the highest orbital $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ empty. Thus, relative to the octahedral case where both $e_{g}$ orbitals are occupied at $+0.6\\Delta_{o}$ each, the 5C-TS reduces or removes occupancy of the most antibonding level. Consequently,\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{5C}}(d^{8})\\leq \\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{8}),\n$$\nso that\n$$\n\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{LFSE}}(d^{8})=\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{5C}}(d^{8})-\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{oct}}(d^{8})\\leq 0.\n$$\nIn words: the LFSE loss on going to the 5C-TS is much smaller for $d^{8}$ than for $d^{3}$, and can even become a net gain (especially for an SP-like TS), which lowers the activation barrier and increases lability.\n\n4) Evaluation of the statements.\n\n- A is false because both have the same octahedral LFSE, so A’s premise is incorrect.\n- B is incomplete/incorrect for kinetics under a D mechanism since the relevant comparison is the LFSE change to the 5C-TS, not just the ground-state LFSE.\n- C is an oversimplification for a D mechanism; although $e_{g}$ occupancy weakens bonds, the decisive factor is the LFSE difference to the 5C-TS, which is better captured by E.\n- D is false; $d^{3}$ suffers a larger LFSE loss on 5C formation than $d^{8}$.\n- E correctly states that $d^{8}$ is more labile because formation of the 5C transition state entails a much smaller LFSE loss (and often a gain) relative to the octahedral ground state, whereas $d^{3}$ incurs a significant LFSE penalty.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2259729"}]}
