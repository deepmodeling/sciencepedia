This practice challenges you to design a synthesis for a specific isomer by strategically choosing the order of reactions. By understanding the relative strengths of the trans effect, you can direct incoming ligands to achieve the desired *cis* configuration, a principle famously applied in the synthesis of the anticancer drug cisplatin [@problem_id:2292878].", "problem": "An inorganic chemist aims to synthesize the square planar palladium(II) complex, *cis*-diamminedichloridopalladium(II), denoted as *cis*-$[PdCl_2(NH_3)_2]$, which has potential applications in catalysis. The readily available starting material is the tetrachloridopalladate(II) ion, $[PdCl_4]^{2-}$. The synthesis must be performed in two distinct, sequential steps.\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of substitution reactions in square planar complexes is governed by the kinetic trans effect, which is the effect of a coordinated ligand on the rate of substitution of the ligand opposite to it. For this problem, you are to use the following abbreviated trans effect series, where ligands are ordered from strongest to weakest trans-directing ability:\n\n$CN^- > I^- > Br^- > Cl^- > H_2O > NH_3$\n\nBased on the principle of the trans effect, which of the following synthetic routes is the correct and most efficient method for preparing *cis*-$[PdCl_2(NH_3)_2]$ from $[PdCl_4]^{2-}$?\n\nA. First, react one mole of $[PdCl_4]^{2-}$ with one mole of ammonia ($NH_3$). Then, react the resulting intermediate product with a second mole of ammonia.\n\nB.

Then, react the resulting product with two moles of ammonia ($NH_3$).", "solution": "For square planar $d^8$ Pd(II), ligand substitution proceeds under kinetic control and the trans effect governs which ligand trans to a given donor is lost fastest. The kinetic rule is: a ligand trans to a stronger trans-directing ligand is substituted more rapidly. Using the given trans effect series $CN^- > I^- > Br^- > Cl^- > H_2O > NH_3$, $Cl^-$ is a stronger trans director than $NH_3$.\n\nRoute A proceeds stepwise from $[PdCl_4]^{2-}$ with one equivalent of $NH_3$, then a second equivalent:\nStep 1: \n$$[PdCl_4]^{2-} + NH_3 \\rightarrow [PdCl_3(NH_3)]^{-} + Cl^{-}.$$\nIn $[PdCl_3(NH_3)]^{-}$, the single $NH_3$ is trans to one $Cl^-$, and there remain two $Cl^{-}$ ligands mutually trans. \nStep 2:\n$$[PdCl_3(NH_3)]^{-} + NH_3 \\rightarrow \\text{*cis*-[PdCl}_2(NH_3)_2] + Cl^{-}.$$\nBy the trans effect, the $Cl^-$ trans to the strongest trans-directing ligand departs fastest. Since $Cl^-$ is stronger than $NH_3$, the $Cl^-$ trans to a $Cl^-$ is more labile than the $Cl^-$ trans to $NH_3$. Thus the incoming $NH_3$ replaces the $Cl^-$ trans to a $Cl^-$ and occupies a site trans to $Cl^-$, placing the two $NH_3$ ligands cis to each other. Therefore Route A yields *cis*-$[PdCl_2(NH_3)_2]$ selectively and efficiently.\n\nRoute B starts from $[Pd(NH_3)_4]^{2+}$ and adds $Cl^{-}$ twice:\n$$[Pd(NH_3)_4]^{2+} + Cl^{-} \\rightarrow [PdCl(NH_3)_3]^{+} + NH_3,$$\nthen a second $Cl^{-}$ enters. Now $Cl^-$ is the strongest trans director present, so the ligand trans to $Cl^-$ (an $NH_3$) is labilized and replaced, placing the second $Cl^-$ trans to the first. This yields *trans*-$[PdCl_2(NH_3)_2]$, not the desired *cis* isomer.\n\nRoute C adds two equivalents of $NH_3$ simultaneously to $[PdCl_4]^{2-}$. This single-step approach lacks the stepwise control provided by the trans effect and typically gives mixtures; it is neither the mandated two-step sequence nor the most selective route to the *cis* product.\n\nRoute D first adds $Cl^{-}$ to $[PdCl_4]^{2-}$, which does not effect a substitution in square planar Pd(II) and at most shifts equilibria toward chlorido species. The subsequent addition of two equivalents of $NH_3$ in one operation again lacks stepwise trans-effect control and is not selective for the *cis* isomer.\n\nTherefore, only Route A uses the trans effect correctly to obtain *cis*-$[PdCl_2(NH_3)_2]$ selectively in two sequential steps.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2292878"}, {"introduction": "Beyond designing a synthetic route, a key skill is predicting the product of a given reaction sequence.

Therefore, the ligand trans to $I^-$ (which is one of the $Cl^-$ ligands) is preferentially substituted. The incoming $Br^-$ replaces the chloride trans to $I^-$ and thus occupies the coordination site trans to $I^-$:\n$$[PtCl_3I]^{2-} + Br^- \\to [PtCl_2BrI]^{2-} + Cl^{-}.$$\nThe resulting geometry has $Br^-$ trans to $I^-$, and the two $Cl^-$ ligands trans to each other. This corresponds to the trans isomer, conventionally denoted *trans*-$[PtCl_2BrI]^{2-}$.\n\nBy the trans effect, this trans product is formed selectively rather than an equimolar mixture. Options suggesting failure of substitution by $Br^-$ or preferential loss of $I^-$ contradict the established reactivity and the specified sequence with one equivalent at each step.\n\nTherefore, the major final product is *trans*-$[PtCl_2BrI]^{2-}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2292842"}, {"introduction": "The trans effect can sometimes lead to outcomes that defy simple stoichiometric expectations.

As a first step, they successfully synthesize cisplatin, *cis*-$[PtCl_2(NH_3)_2]$, by reacting potassium tetrachloroplatinate(II), $K_2[PtCl_4]$, with two equivalents of ammonia.\n\nFor their next synthesis, they attempt to prepare an analogous complex using thiourea, $SC(NH_2)_2$ (abbreviated as 'tu'). Following the same general procedure, they react an aqueous solution of $K_2[PtCl_4]$ with exactly two molar equivalents of thiourea, hoping to isolate a disubstituted product. To their surprise, analysis of the reaction mixture reveals that no disubstituted complex, such as *cis*- or *trans*-$[PtCl_2(tu)_2]$, is present in any significant quantity.

Associative substitution gives the monosubstituted complex:\n$$[PtCl_4]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons [PtCl_3(tu)]^{-} + Cl^{-}.$$\nBecause $tu$ has a stronger trans effect than $Cl^{-}$, the chloride trans to $tu$ in $[PtCl_3(tu)]^{-}$ is the most labile site for the next substitution.\n\nStep 2 (successive substitutions driven by trans effect). The enhanced lability trans to $tu$ favors the next substitution trans to the first $tu$, continuing stepwise:\n$$[PtCl_3(tu)]^{-} + tu \\rightleftharpoons [PtCl_2(tu)_2] + Cl^{-},$$\n$$[PtCl_2(tu)_2] + tu \\rightleftharpoons [PtCl(tu)_3]^{+} + Cl^{-},$$\n$$[PtCl(tu)_3]^{+} + tu \\rightleftharpoons [Pt(tu)_4]^{2+} + Cl^{-}.$$\nBecause each added $tu$ increases the trans effect at the remaining chlorides, substitution is autocatalytic on a given Pt center: once a $tu$ binds, further substitutions on that same metal become progressively faster, funneling toward the fully substituted $[Pt(tu)_4]^{2+}$, provided ligand supply allows.\n\nStep 3 (mass balance with exactly two equivalents of $tu$). Let $n$ be the total moles of Pt centers initially as $[PtCl_4]^{2-}$, and let the total moles of $tu$ added be $2n$ (exactly two equivalents per Pt). If $x$ moles of Pt centers proceed all the way to $[Pt(tu)_4]^{2+}$, they consume $4x$ moles of $tu$. The remaining $n - x$ Pt centers can remain as unreacted $[PtCl_4]^{2-}$. The ligand balance is\n$$4x = 2n \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = \\frac{n}{2}.$$\nTherefore, the distribution driven by the strong trans effect and soft-soft preference is\n$$\\frac{n}{2}\\ \\text{moles of}\\ [Pt(tu)_4]^{2+} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{n}{2}\\ \\text{moles of unreacted}\\ [PtCl_4]^{2-}.$$\nCrucially, mixed-ligand, partially substituted species do not accumulate: once a $tu$ binds, subsequent substitutions on that same center are favored kinetically and proceed to completion on a subset of Pt centers, while others remain unreacted due to the limited total $tu$.\n\nStep 4 (matching the observation and excluding alternatives). The experiment reports a single, new platinum-containing complex ion and substantial unreacted $[PtCl_4]^{2-}$, with no significant amounts of disubstituted complexes. This is exactly the outcome predicted above: the only new complex is $[Pt(tu)_4]^{2+}$, and the rest remains as starting $[PtCl_4]^{2-}$. Options A and B (di-substituted) are absent as observed. Option C (mono-substituted) would not rationalize the strong trans effect–driven funneling to higher substitution on a subset of centers under limited ligand. Option E would produce two new ions, contradicting the statement that only a single new complex ion is detected.\n\nHence, the newly formed complex is $[Pt(tu)_4]^{2+}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2292839"}]}
