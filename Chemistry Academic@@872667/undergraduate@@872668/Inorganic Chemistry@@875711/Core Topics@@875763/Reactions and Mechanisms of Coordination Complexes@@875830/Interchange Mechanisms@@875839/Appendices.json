Two specific reactions are investigated at the same temperature:\n\nReaction 1: The anation of the aquapentamminecobalt(III) ion by thiocyanate.\n$$ [Co(NH_3)_5(H_2O)]^{3+} + SCN^- \\rightarrow [Co(NH_3)_5(SCN)]^{2+} + H_2O $$\nThe second-order rate constant for this reaction is measured to be $k_1$.\n\nReaction 2: The aquation of the chloropentamminecobalt(III) ion.\n$$ [Co(NH_3)_5Cl]^{2+} + H_2O \\rightarrow [Co(NH_3)_5(H_2O)]^{3+} + Cl^- $$\nThe pseudo-first-order rate constant for this reaction is measured to be $k_2$.\n\nExperimentally, it is observed that $k_2$ is substantially larger than $k_1$, indicating that Reaction 2 proceeds much faster than Reaction 1.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most chemically sound explanation for this kinetic observation?\n\nA. The entering ligand in Reaction 2 ($H_2O$) is a much weaker nucleophile than the entering ligand in Reaction 1 ($SCN^-$), which paradoxically accelerates the substitution process.\nB. The mechanism is primarily associative, and the formation of a seven-coordinate intermediate is sterically more favorable for the smaller entering water ligand in Reaction 2.\nC. The overall charge of the complex in Reaction 1 ($+3$) is higher than in Reaction 2 ($+2$), leading to stronger electrostatic repulsion with the entering $SCN^-$ anion and thus a slower reaction.\nD. The mechanism is primarily dissociative, and the bond between cobalt and the chlorine leaving group is significantly weaker than the bond between cobalt and the oxygen of the water leaving group.\nE. The entropy of activation for Reaction 2 is much more favorable because the release of a simple monatomic ion ($Cl^-$) into a polar solvent is entropically favored over the release of a more structured water molecule.", "solution": "We compare the mechanisms and rate-determining factors for ligand substitution in low-spin $d^{6}$ octahedral cobalt(III) ammine complexes. Such systems generally undergo substitution by dissociative interchange (denoted $I_{\\text{d}}$), in which the rate-determining step is partial or full cleavage of the metal–leaving-group bond, with only weak (at most) dependence on the nature of the entering ligand.\n\nLet $ML_{6}$ denote the cobalt(III) complex and $X$ the leaving group. For a dissociative (or $I_{\\text{d}}$) pathway, the rate law for the elementary bond cleavage step is\n$$\nr = k_{\\text{d}}[ML_6],\n$$\nand the observed rate constant is governed primarily by the M–X bond strength (weaker M–X gives larger $k_{\\text{d}}$). The entering ligand influences the subsequent fast capture step and, if present at varying concentration, can give second-order kinetics overall, but the magnitude still reflects the ease of M–X bond rupture.\n\nApply this to the two reactions:\n\nReaction 1 (anation):\n$$\n[Co(NH_3)_5(H_2O)]^{3+} + SCN^{-} \\rightarrow [Co(NH_3)_5(SCN)]^{2+} + H_2O,\n$$\nmeasured as second-order with rate constant $k_1$.

This practice [@problem_id:2261479] introduces the idea of a mechanistic continuum, where the transition state can have varying degrees of associative ($I_a$) or dissociative ($I_d$) character. By applying Hard-Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) theory, you can predict how the electronic properties of the entering nucleophile can stabilize the transition state and influence the reaction pathway, adding a crucial layer of nuance to your mechanistic analysis.", "problem": "Consider a hypothetical octahedral aqueous complex, $[M(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$, where $M^{2+}$ is a second-row transition metal ion classified as a soft acid according to Hard-Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) theory.

Both reactions proceed via an interchange mechanism. Based on the principles of HSAB theory and its influence on transition state stability, which of the following statements most accurately contrasts the likely substitution mechanisms for these two reactions?\n\nA. Both reactions will proceed with a strong dissociative interchange ($I_d$) character, as the primary energetic barrier is the breaking of the strong M-OH$_2$ bond.\nB. Reaction 1 (with hard base $X^-$) will exhibit more associative interchange ($I_a$) character than Reaction 2, because the electrostatic attraction between the hard base and the metal cation is stronger.\nC. Reaction 2 (with soft base $Y^-$) will exhibit more associative interchange ($I_a$) character than Reaction 1, because the favorable soft-soft interaction lowers the energy of the associatively-formed transition state.\nD. Both reactions will proceed with a strong associative interchange ($I_a$) character, as the presence of any entering nucleophile will favor an increase in the coordination number of the transition state.\nE. The mechanisms cannot be predicted, as the lability of the aqua ligands is solely determined by the d-electron count of the metal ion, independent of the entering ligand's properties.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the HSAB principle: soft acids interact more strongly and with greater covalent character with soft bases, while hard acids interact more strongly and with greater electrostatic character with hard bases. The given metal ion $M^{2+}$ is a second-row transition metal (4d), typically softer and more polarizable than first-row analogues, and thus classified as a soft acid.\n\nFor ligand substitution proceeding by an interchange mechanism, the transition state can vary continuously between associative interchange ($I_{a}$), where bond formation to the entering ligand is more advanced and stabilizes the transition state, and dissociative interchange ($I_{d}$), where bond breaking to the leaving group is more advanced and the entering ligand interacts only weakly in the transition state. The key energetic factor distinguishing $I_{a}$ versus $I_{d}$ character is the extent to which the entering ligand can stabilize the transition state by favorable interaction with the metal center.\n\nConsider Reaction 1 with hard base $X^{-}$:\n$$\n[M(H_2O)_6]^{2+} + X^{-} \\rightarrow [M(H_2O)_5X]^{+} + H_2O.\n$$\nBecause $M^{2+}$ is a soft acid and $X^{-}$ is a hard base, the $M\\!-\\!X$ interaction is mismatched (hard-soft), leading to relatively weak stabilization of any transition state in which $M$ and $X^{-}$ are coming together. Consequently, an associative transition-state structure is not strongly stabilized, and the pathway exhibits relatively more dissociative interchange ($I_{d}$) character compared to a case with a better-matched entering ligand.\n\nNow consider Reaction 2 with soft base $Y^{-}$:\n$$\n[M(H_2O)_6]^{2+} + Y^{-} \\rightarrow [M(H_2O)_5Y]^{+} + H_2O.\n$$\nHere, $M^{2+}$ (soft acid) and $Y^{-}$ (soft base) are well matched, so their interaction is stronger and more covalent. In an interchange mechanism, this favorable soft-soft interaction stabilizes a transition state where $M$ begins to bond to $Y^{-}$ as water departs, thereby lowering the activation free energy for an associative transition-state structure. Thus, Reaction 2 is expected to show more associative interchange ($I_{a}$) character than Reaction 1.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the entering ligand’s ability to stabilize the transition state can shift the mechanism toward $I_{a}$, especially for soft-soft pairs.\n- B is incorrect because although hard bases can have strong electrostatic attraction to hard acids, a soft acid does not favor a hard base in forming a stabilized associative transition state; the mismatch weakens such stabilization relative to a soft base.\n- C is correct: the soft-soft interaction between $M^{2+}$ and $Y^{-}$ lowers the energy of the associatively formed transition state, giving Reaction 2 more $I_{a}$ character than Reaction 1.\n- D is incorrect: not all entering nucleophiles produce strong $I_{a}$ character; the nature of the entering ligand matters, particularly via HSAB matching.\n- E is incorrect: the entering ligand’s properties (hardness/softness, polarizability) do influence the mechanism; it is not determined solely by the d-electron count.\n\nTherefore, the statement that most accurately contrasts the mechanisms is that Reaction 2 (with soft base $Y^{-}$) exhibits more associative interchange character than Reaction 1, due to favorable soft-soft stabilization of the transition state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2261479"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative predictions to quantitative evidence is a key step in chemical kinetics.
