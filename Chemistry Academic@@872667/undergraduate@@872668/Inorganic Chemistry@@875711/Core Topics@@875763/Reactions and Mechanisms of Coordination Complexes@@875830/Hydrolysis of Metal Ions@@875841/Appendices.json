This practice explores this broader concept by comparing the dramatically different reactivities of silicon tetrachloride ($SiCl_4$) and carbon tetrachloride ($CCl_4$) with water. This classic example illustrates the fundamental role that electronic structure and the availability of low-energy orbitals to expand the coordination sphere play in enabling a hydrolysis reaction.[@problem_id:2259478]", "problem": "An inorganic chemistry student observes a stark difference in reactivity when water is added to two different Group 14 tetrachlorides. When liquid water is added to silicon tetrachloride ($SiCl_4$), a vigorous reaction occurs, producing a white precipitate of hydrated silicon dioxide ($SiO_2 \\cdot nH_2O$) and fumes of hydrogen chloride ($HCl$) gas. In contrast, when water is added to carbon tetrachloride ($CCl_4$), the two liquids form immiscible layers and no reaction is observed under the same conditions.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for this observed difference in reactivity towards hydrolysis?\n\nA. The hydrolysis of $CCl_4$ is thermodynamically unfavorable ($\\Delta G > 0$), while the hydrolysis of $SiCl_4$ is thermodynamically favorable ($\\Delta G < 0$).\nB. The $C-Cl$ bonds in $CCl_4$ are significantly less polar than the $Si-Cl$ bonds in $SiCl_4$, which makes the carbon atom not sufficiently electrophilic to be attacked by water.\nC. Carbon lacks low-energy vacant orbitals to accept a lone pair of electrons from a water molecule, whereas silicon can use its accessible vacant 3d orbitals to expand its coordination shell and form a reactive intermediate.\nD. The average bond enthalpy of a $C-Cl$ bond is much greater than that of a $Si-Cl$ bond, requiring too much energy to initiate the reaction for $CCl_4$.\nE. The four chlorine atoms sterically hinder the central carbon atom in $CCl_4$ more effectively than they do the central silicon atom in $SiCl_4$, preventing the approach of a water molecule.", "solution": "We compare the hydrolysis behavior of $SiCl_{4}$ and $CCl_{4}$ by analyzing the mechanistic requirements for nucleophilic substitution at a tetravalent center and the availability of acceptor orbitals on the central atom.\n\nFirst, write the net hydrolysis for silicon tetrachloride (before condensation):\n$$\nSiCl_{4} + 4 H_{2}O \\to Si(OH)_{4} + 4 HCl\n$$\nfollowed by condensation of $Si(OH)_{4}$ to produce $SiO_{2}\\cdot nH_{2}O$. Experimentally, this proceeds rapidly and exothermically.\n\nIn contrast, under the same conditions:\n$$\nCCl_{4} + H_{2}O \\not\\to \\text{(no reaction observed)}\n$$\nand the liquids remain immiscible.\n\nKey mechanistic principle: Hydrolysis at a tetrahedral center typically proceeds by nucleophilic attack of a lone pair from water into a low-energy vacant acceptor orbital on the central atom to form a higher-coordinate intermediate or transition state, followed by elimination of chloride. For Group 14 tetrachlorides:\n- For silicon, an associative pathway with a pentacoordinate (or even hexacoordinate) silicon center is accessible because silicon, being a third-period element, has available low-lying acceptor orbitals that can be engaged during nucleophilic attack. Traditional descriptions invoke vacant $3d$ orbitals to accept electron density and permit expansion beyond the octet; in modern orbital terms, low-lying acceptor orbitals (including $\\sigma^{*}$ orbitals on $Si-Cl$) are sufficiently accessible for forming hypercoordinate silicon species. This enables rapid hydrolysis.\n- For carbon, a second-period element, the valence shell is limited to the octet, and there are no low-energy vacant orbitals that can be used to stabilize a pentacoordinate carbon intermediate. Therefore, an associative mechanism is strongly disfavored. Alternative pathways such as $S_{N}1$ would require formation of $CCl_3^+$, which is highly unstable, and $S_{N}2$ by water is also kinetically inaccessible due to the very poor ability of water (a weak nucleophile) to displace chloride at a deactivated, tetrahalo-substituted carbon center.\n\nNow evaluate the options against these mechanistic facts:\n\n- Option A (thermodynamics): The observed lack of reaction for $CCl_{4}$ is due to kinetic barriers, not necessarily unfavorable $\\Delta G$. In fact, formation of strong $H-Cl$ and $C-O$ bonds could be thermodynamically permissible, but the reaction does not proceed because the mechanism is blocked. Hence A does not provide the most fundamental explanation.\n\n- Option B (polarity/electrophilicity): While $Si-Cl$ bonds are indeed more polar than $C-Cl$ and silicon is more electrophilic than carbon, $CCl_{4}$ still has polarized $C-Cl$ bonds with partial positive character on carbon. Mere differences in bond polarity do not account for the dramatic qualitative difference (vigorous hydrolysis versus none). This is not the most fundamental reason.\n\n- Option C (vacant orbitals and coordination expansion): Carbon lacks low-energy vacant orbitals and cannot expand its octet; silicon can engage accessible acceptor orbitals (classically described as vacant $3d$) to form hypercoordinate intermediates, enabling associative nucleophilic attack and rapid hydrolysis. This is the textbook, mechanistically fundamental reason for the sharp contrast. Therefore C is correct.\n\n- Option D (bond enthalpy comparison): The claim that the $C-Cl$ bond is much stronger than $Si-Cl$ is not correct in the way needed to explain the observation; moreover, hydrolysis of $SiCl_{4}$ is very favorable due to strong $Si-O$ bond formation, and $CCl_{4}$ does not hydrolyze not because initiation energy is too high from stronger $C-Cl$ bonds, but because there is no viable mechanistic pathway. D is incorrect.\n\n- Option E (sterics): Although silicon is larger (which would, if anything, reduce steric hindrance), sterics are not the primary determinant for the massive difference observed. E is not the fundamental explanation.\n\nThus, the most accurate and fundamental explanation among the given options is that carbon cannot access low-energy vacant orbitals to support hypercoordination in an associative hydrolysis mechanism, whereas silicon can, enabling rapid hydrolysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2259478"}]}
