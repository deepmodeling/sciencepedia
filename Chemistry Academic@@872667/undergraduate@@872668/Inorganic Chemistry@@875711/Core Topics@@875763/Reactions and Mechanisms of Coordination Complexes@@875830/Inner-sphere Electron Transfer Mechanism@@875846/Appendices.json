The reductant, $[\\text{Cr}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$, is a high-spin $d^4$ complex and is therefore substitutionally labile, causing the bridged intermediate to dissociate before electron transfer can occur.", "solution": "Inner-sphere electron transfer requires two necessary kinetic-structural conditions: (i) at least one reactant must carry a ligand that can act as a bridge between the two metal centers, and (ii) a bridged precursor must form at a kinetically feasible rate, which typically requires substitutional lability at the site where the bridge forms.\n\nAnalyze the two reactants:\n- The oxidant $[\\text{Co}(\\text{NH}_3)_6]^{3+}$ is a low-spin $d^6$ Co(III) complex, which is classically substitutionally inert. Its ligands are $\\text{NH}_3$, which are poor leaving groups and poor bridging ligands in inner-sphere electron transfer; they neither promote rapid substitution nor provide an anionic donor that commonly serves as a bridge (such as $\\text{Cl}^-$, $\\text{Br}^-$, $\\text{SCN}^-$, or $\\text{OH}^-$).\n- The reductant $[\\text{Cr}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$ is a high-spin $d^4$ Cr(II) complex, which is typically substitutionally labile. Although $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ can in rare cases bridge or, more commonly upon deprotonation to $\\text{OH}^-$, form bridges, the key requirement in inner-sphere ET is that one partner already possesses a ligand capable of binding simultaneously to both metals and that the inert partner allows formation of the bridged intermediate.\n\nBecause $[\\text{Co}(\\text{NH}_3)_6]^{3+}$ lacks any suitable bridging ligand (e.g., halide) and is substitutionally inert, it cannot readily form the necessary bridged precursor. This is precisely why inner-sphere transfer is precluded and the reaction proceeds by an outer-sphere pathway. Therefore, the most fundamental and accurate reason is that the oxidant is substitutionally inert and lacks a bridging-capable ligand.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is false: high-spin $d^4$ Cr(II) is typically labile, not inert.\n- B is too strong: $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$/$\\text{OH}^-$ can bridge in some cases; $\\text{NH}_3$ is generally non-bridging, but saying both are incapable is inaccurate.\n- C is correct: $[\\text{Co}(\\text{NH}_3)_6]^{3+}$ is low-spin $d^6$ and inert, and its $\\text{NH}_3$ ligands do not serve as bridging ligands.\n- D is irrelevant: the thermodynamics of the overall redox do not dictate the feasibility of forming a bridged intermediate; kinetics and ligand set do.\n- E is incorrect in mechanism: lability of $[\\text{Cr}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$ would favor, not prevent, bridge formation; dissociation before electron transfer is not the fundamental barrier here.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2260629"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the theoretical requirements is one thing; proving a mechanism experimentally is another.

The reaction does not go to completion, and the observed free chloride is due to the dissociation of the unreacted $[\\text{Co}(\\text{NH}_3)_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+}$ starting material.", "solution": "I begin by recalling the mechanistic signatures of inner-sphere versus outer-sphere electron transfer between coordination complexes:\n\n1) In an inner-sphere mechanism, a ligand capable of bridging both metal centers forms a transient bridge, and in Taube-type systems this often results in ligand transfer. For $[\\text{Co}(\\text{NH}_3)_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+}$ reacting with $[\\text{Cr}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$ via a chloride bridge, the hallmark product is the chromium(III) complex retaining the transferred chloride, namely $[\\text{Cr}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+}$. A classic diagnostic (e.g., isotopic labeling) shows the bridging ligand ends up bound to the product metal center rather than being released as free $\\text{Cl}^-$.\n\n2) In an outer-sphere mechanism, no ligand bridge forms and no ligand transfer accompanies the electron transfer. The primary coordination spheres remain unchanged during electron transfer. However, after electron transfer, changes in metal oxidation state can drastically alter ligand lability. In particular, Co(III) ammine complexes are substitution-inert, whereas Co(II) ammine complexes are substitution-labile. Thus, after outer-sphere reduction of $[\\text{Co}(\\text{NH}_3)_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+}$ to a Co(II) species, rapid aquation and chloride dissociation can occur, producing free $\\text{Cl}^-$:\n$$\n[\\text{Co}(\\text{NH}_3)_5\\text{Cl}]^{+} \\xrightarrow{\\text{rapid aquation}} [\\text{Co}(\\text{NH}_3)_5(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})]^{2+} + \\text{Cl}^{-}\n$$\n\nNext, I interpret the experimental observation: immediately after the reaction has gone to completion, a significant concentration of free $\\text{Cl}^-(\\text{aq})$ is detected.\n\n3) If the reaction were proceeding exclusively via inner-sphere chloride-bridged transfer (Option A), the expected immediate product on the chromium side is $[\\text{Cr}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+}$, not free $\\text{Cl}^-$. The chromium(III) center is well known to be kinetically inert; symbolically, $k_{\\text{aq}}(\\text{Cr(III)}) \\ll k_{\\text{aq}}(\\text{Co(II)})$, so rapid release of $\\text{Cl}^-$ from $[\\text{Cr}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+}$ immediately after completion is not expected. Therefore, the immediate presence of significant free $\\text{Cl}^-$ is inconsistent with exclusive inner-sphere ligand transfer.\n\n4) Option D asserts that inner-sphere occurs but $[\\text{Cr}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+}$ is kinetically labile and rapidly releases $\\text{Cl}^-$. This contradicts well-established inertness of Cr(III) complexes; rapid chloride loss from Cr(III) is unlikely on the experimental timescale implied by “immediately after completion.”\n\n5) Option E suggests incomplete reaction and dissociation of unreacted $[\\text{Co}(\\text{NH}_3)_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+}$ as the source of $\\text{Cl}^-$. However, $[\\text{Co}(\\text{NH}_3)_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+}$ is a Co(III) ammine complex and is substitution-inert; immediate chloride dissociation from the unreacted starting material is inconsistent with its known kinetic inertness and with the statement that the reaction has gone to completion.\n\n6) Option C claims the chloride ligand is a spectator and not involved in the electron transfer. This statement is vague and does not directly address the mechanism. In an outer-sphere pathway the chloride is not a bridging ligand, but after reduction to Co(II) it can dissociate rapidly, giving free $\\text{Cl}^{-}$. Thus, while chloride does not mediate electron transfer in an outer-sphere path, calling it simply a spectator is less precise than identifying the mechanism.\n\n7) The immediate appearance of significant free $\\text{Cl}^-$ is most naturally explained if electron transfer occurs predominantly by an outer-sphere pathway. After ET, the Co center is reduced from Co(III) to Co(II), becoming much more labile; chloride dissociation is then fast, producing $\\text{Cl}^-$ in solution. At the same time, inner-sphere via chloride transfer would have produced $[\\text{Cr}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_5\\text{Cl}]^{2+}$ that would retain chloride due to Cr(III) inertness, contradicting the observation. Therefore, the experimental finding supports a predominantly outer-sphere mechanism.\n\nOn this basis, the most accurate conclusion is that the reaction proceeds predominantly via an outer-sphere mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2260611"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative principles to quantitative prediction is a key step in mastering reaction mechanisms.
