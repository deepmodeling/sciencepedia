They learn about two important ligand-dependent phenomena: the spectrochemical series, which ranks ligands based on the magnitude of the crystal field splitting energy ($\\Delta_o$) they produce, and the nephelauxetic series, which ranks ligands based on their ability to decrease the inter-electron repulsion among the d-electrons of the central metal ion. This reduction in repulsion is quantified by the nephelauxetic ratio, $\\beta = \\frac{B_{\\text{complex}}}{B_{\\text{free-ion}}}$, where $B$ is the Racah inter-electron repulsion parameter.

For a wide range of metal ions, it is experimentally observed that ammonia is a stronger-field ligand than water.

The tetrahedral complex has $B = 730 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and the octahedral complex has $B = 690 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.

The tetrahedral complex has $B = 690 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and the octahedral complex has $B = 730 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. This is because the lower coordination number in the tetrahedral geometry reduces steric hindrance, allowing each ligand to form a shorter, more covalent bond with the metal center.\n\nC. The tetrahedral complex has $B = 690 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and the octahedral complex has $B = 730 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.
