The aqua ligand ($H_2O$) is too weak a field ligand to cause a d-orbital splitting sufficient for a visible-light transition in the zinc complex, but it is strong enough for the vanadium complex.\n\nE. Vanadium has a higher atomic mass than zinc, which is the primary factor determining the color of its complexes.", "solution": "We apply crystal field theory for octahedral aqua complexes. In an octahedral field, the five metal d orbitals split into a lower-energy triply degenerate set, $t_{2g}$, and a higher-energy doubly degenerate set, $e_{g}$, separated by the crystal field splitting energy $\\Delta_{o}$. Color in many transition-metal complexes arises from electronic d–d transitions in which an electron is promoted from $t_{2g}$ to $e_{g}$ by absorbing a photon with energy approximately equal to $\\Delta_{o}$; if $\\Delta_{o}$ lies in the visible range, the complex appears colored.\n\nDetermine the d-electron counts:\n- For $Zn^{2+}$: the neutral zinc configuration is $[Ar]\\,3d^{10}4s^{2}$. Removing two $4s$ electrons gives $Zn^{2+}$ with $3d^{10}$, i.e., a completely filled d subshell. In an octahedral field, this corresponds to $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{4}$, with all d orbitals fully occupied.\n- For $V^{2+}$: the neutral vanadium configuration is $[Ar]\\,3d^{3}4s^{2}$. Removing two $4s$ electrons gives $V^{2+}$ with $3d^{3}$. In an octahedral field, this gives $t_{2g}^{3}e_{g}^{0}$, leaving the $e_{g}$ set empty.\n\nAnalyze the possibility of d–d transitions:\n- For $[Zn(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{2+}$, a d–d transition would require promoting an electron from $t_{2g}$ to $e_{g}$. However, the $e_{g}$ set is already fully occupied ($e_{g}^{4}$ implies two electrons in each $e_{g}$ orbital), so placing an additional electron into any $e_{g}$ orbital would violate the Pauli exclusion principle. Therefore, d–d transitions are prohibited for $d^{10}$ ($t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{4}$) configurations. As a result, no d–d absorption occurs in the visible region, and the complex is colorless, barring weak or absent charge-transfer absorptions.\n- For $[V(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{2+}$, with $t_{2g}^{3}e_{g}^{0}$, there are empty $e_{g}$ orbitals, so promotion of an electron from $t_{2g}$ to $e_{g}$ is allowed. With $H_{2}O$ as a moderate-field ligand in the spectrochemical series, $\\Delta_{o}$ for a first-row $M^{2+}$ ion typically lies in the visible range, so absorption occurs, giving a complementary visible color (observed as violet). These transitions are spin-allowed for $d^{3}$ (e.g., $^{4}A_{2g}\\rightarrow{}^{4}T_{2g}$), so sufficient intensity is expected despite the Laporte rule.\n\nEvaluate the statements:\n- A is incorrect: Zn is not considered a transition element in the strict IUPAC sense because it lacks an incompletely filled d subshell in any common oxidation state, not because its compounds are generally colorless.\n- B is incorrect: the absence of color in the zinc complex is not due to an excessively large $\\Delta_{o}$; rather, there are no permissible d–d transitions in a $d^{10}$ system.\n- C is correct: $Zn^{2+}$ has a completely filled d subshell, which prohibits the d–d transitions responsible for color in many transition-metal complexes.\n- D is incorrect: the same ligand $H_{2}O$ is present in both; the key difference is the electronic configuration ($d^{10}$ versus $d^{3}$), not that water is selectively too weak for one and strong for the other.\n- E is incorrect factually (zinc has the higher atomic mass) and conceptually (atomic mass is not the primary determinant of complex color).\n\nTherefore, the correct fundamental reason is that the $Zn^{2+}$ ion has a completely filled d subshell, preventing d–d transitions, while $V^{2+}$ does not, allowing visible-light d–d transitions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2295960"}]}
