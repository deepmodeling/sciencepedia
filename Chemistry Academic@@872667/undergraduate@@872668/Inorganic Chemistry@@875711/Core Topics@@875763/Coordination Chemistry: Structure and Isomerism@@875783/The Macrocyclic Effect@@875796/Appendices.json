An observable difference in thermodynamic stability exists between the resulting complexes, $[Ni(\\text{Ligand A})(H_2O)_2]^{2+}$ and $[Ni(\\text{Ligand B})(H_2O)_2]^{2+}$. This phenomenon is known as the macrocyclic effect.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately identifies the more stable complex and provides the primary thermodynamic reason for its enhanced stability?\n\nA. The complex with Ligand A is more stable because the flexible open chain can better adapt to the ideal coordination geometry of the $Ni^{2+}$ ion, maximizing the favorable enthalpy change ($\\Delta H^\\circ$).\n\nB. The complex with Ligand B is more stable because the rigidity of the cyclic ligand prevents bond angle strain upon coordination, leading to a significantly more favorable enthalpy change ($\\Delta H^\\circ$).\n\nC. The complexes with Ligand A and Ligand B have nearly identical stability because they involve the formation of the same number and type of metal-ligand bonds.\n\nD. The complex with Ligand B is more stable because the ligand is \"pre-organized\" for binding, resulting in a much smaller loss of conformational entropy upon complexation compared to the flexible open-chain ligand.\n\nE. The complex with Ligand A is more stable because its coordination releases more bound solvent molecules into the bulk solution, leading to a more favorable entropy change ($\\Delta S^\\circ$).", "solution": "Write the overall complexation reaction for each ligand $L$ (Ligand A or Ligand B) as\n$$\n[Ni(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{2+} + L \\rightleftharpoons [NiL(H_{2}O)_{2}]^{2+} + 4\\,H_{2}O.\n$$\nDefine the equilibrium constant $K$ for this reaction and the standard thermodynamic relation\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -R T \\ln K = \\Delta H^{\\circ} - T \\Delta S^{\\circ}.\n$$\nTo compare stabilities, compare $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ for Ligand A and Ligand B.

In both cases, four $Ni$–$N$ coordinate bonds are formed and four $Ni$–$O(H_{2}O)$ bonds are broken. Because the donor atoms and denticity are the same, the dominant enthalpic contributions are similar. Small differences in ring strain or bite angles may slightly affect $\\Delta H^{\\circ}$, but these effects are typically not the primary driver of the macrocyclic effect.\n\nAnalyze $\\Delta S^{\\circ}$. Decompose the entropy change conceptually into contributions, including release of solvent, translational and rotational changes, and conformational (internal) entropy of the ligand:\n$$\n\\Delta S^{\\circ} \\approx \\Delta S_{\\text{solv}}^{\\circ} + \\Delta S_{\\text{trans/rot}}^{\\circ} + \\Delta S_{\\text{conf}}^{\\circ}.\n$$\nFor both Ligand A and Ligand B reactions, four water molecules are released, so $\\Delta S_{\\text{solv}}^{\\circ}$ is comparable. The stoichiometry is the same (one complex formed from one metal ion and one ligand, with the same number of waters released), so the translational and rotational entropy changes are similar.\n\nThe key difference lies in $\\Delta S_{\\text{conf}}^{\\circ}$. Ligand A is an open-chain, highly flexible molecule that loses many conformational microstates upon wrapping around the metal ion to form four chelate rings; this imposes a large unfavorable (more negative) conformational entropy change. Ligand B is a macrocycle that is pre-organized; many of the conformational constraints required for binding are already present in the free ligand, so the loss of conformational entropy upon binding is much smaller.

This increases overall stability for II relative to I.\n\nFinally, the macrocyclic effect distinguishes III from II.

This final practice explores the crucial principle of size-selectivity, a \"lock-and-key\" aspect of macrocyclic chemistry. By considering a scenario with a size mismatch, you will predict the resulting structural distortions and their consequences for the stability of the complex, revealing the limits of the macrocyclic effect [@problem_id:2294982].", "problem": "The macrocyclic effect describes the enhanced stability of a metal complex containing a macrocyclic ligand compared to a complex with an analogous open-chain (acyclic) ligand. A key factor contributing to this stability is the 'preorganization' of the macrocycle's donor atoms for binding a metal ion. However, the magnitude of this effect is highly sensitive to the compatibility between the metal ion's size and the macrocycle's cavity size.\n\nConsider a standard porphyrin macrocycle, which provides a coordination cavity formed by four nitrogen donor atoms. This cavity is ideally sized to form a highly stable, planar complex with a metal ion like iron(II), $Fe^{2+}$. Now, imagine an attempt to form a complex using the same porphyrin macrocycle but with a lead(II) ion, $Pb^{2+}$. The ionic radius of $Pb^{2+}$ is significantly larger than that of $Fe^{2+}$.\n\nBased on the principles of coordination chemistry and the macrocyclic effect, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected structural outcome and its effect on the stability of the resulting $Pb^{2+}$-porphyrin complex compared to an ideal, size-matched system?\n\nA. The large $Pb^{2+}$ ion will force the porphyrin ring to expand uniformly, creating longer, stronger metal-nitrogen bonds and forming an exceptionally stable planar complex.\n\nB.

The $Pb^{2+}$ ion will bind to the exterior of the porphyrin ring, forming weak electrostatic interactions without directly coordinating to the electron-rich nitrogen atoms.\n\nE. The $Pb^{2+}$ ion will be reduced to metallic lead (Pb⁰) by the porphyrin ligand, which then precipitates out of the solution, preventing complex formation.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the structural and thermodynamic consequences of fitting a large metal ion, $Pb^{2+}$, into a porphyrin macrocycle that is optimally sized for a smaller ion, $Fe^{2+}$. This requires an understanding of the macrocyclic effect and the principle of size matching in coordination chemistry.\n\nThe stability of a metal-macrocycle complex is maximized when there is a perfect match between the size of the metal ion and the size of the cavity provided by the macrocyclic ligand. This ideal fit allows the metal ion to form metal-ligand bonds of optimal length and geometry without inducing any strain in the ligand's framework. The ligand is 'preorganized' for this optimal binding.\n\nIn the given scenario, the $Pb^{2+}$ ion is too large for the porphyrin cavity. We must evaluate the consequences of this size mismatch.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. The large $Pb^{2+}$ ion will force the porphyrin ring to expand uniformly, creating longer, stronger metal-nitrogen bonds and forming an exceptionally stable planar complex.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While the ligand may deform, forcing it to expand introduces significant ring strain. This is an energetically unfavorable process (an enthalpic penalty) that destabilizes the complex. Furthermore, longer metal-ligand bonds are generally weaker, not stronger, than bonds of optimal length. Therefore, the resulting complex would be less stable, not exceptionally stable.\n\n**B. Complexation will not occur because the $Pb^{2+}$ ion is sterically hindered from interacting with the nitrogen donor atoms within the porphyrin cavity.**\nThis statement is too absolute and thus incorrect. While the size mismatch creates an energetic penalty, it does not typically make complexation impossible. A complex will likely form, but its stability constant will be lower than that of a size-matched system. The coordination can still be thermodynamically favorable compared to the solvated ion and free ligand, even if it's not optimal.\n\n**C. The $Pb^{2+}$ ion will coordinate to the porphyrin, but being too large to fit perfectly within the plane of the nitrogen atoms, it will be displaced to an 'out-of-plane' position. This structural distortion introduces strain and results in a less stable complex than one with a size-matched ion.**\nThis statement accurately describes the most common structural adaptation in such cases. To accommodate the large cation, the metal ion sits above the plane defined by the four nitrogen donor atoms. This is known as an 'out-of-plane' or 'sitting-atop' complex. This geometry allows the $Pb^{2+}$ ion to bind to the four nitrogen donors, but the porphyrin ring must pucker or dome to do so. This distortion from planarity introduces strain energy into the ligand, which reduces the overall thermodynamic stability of the complex. This is the correct description of the structural and energetic outcome.\n\n**D. The $Pb^{2+}$ ion will bind to the exterior of the porphyrin ring, forming weak electrostatic interactions without directly coordinating to the electron-rich nitrogen atoms.**\nThis is incorrect. The primary binding sites in a porphyrin are the Lewis basic lone pairs of the four inner nitrogen atoms. These sites are far more electron-rich and poised for coordination than the relatively non-polar hydrocarbon periphery of the macrocycle. The primary coordination event will involve these nitrogen donors.\n\n**E. The $Pb^{2+}$ ion will be reduced to metallic lead (Pb⁰) by the porphyrin ligand, which then precipitates out of the solution, preventing complex formation.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem is framed as a coordination chemistry question, not a redox question. While porphyrins can participate in redox reactions, there is no basis to assume that the porphyrin ligand would spontaneously reduce $Pb^{2+}$ to $Pb^{0}$ under typical complexation conditions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate description is that the large $Pb^{2+}$ ion will form an out-of-plane complex, which is less stable than an ideal, planar complex due to induced ligand strain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2294982"}]}
