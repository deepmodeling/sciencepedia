Let $N_{\\text{coord}}$ denote the coordination number and $\\delta$ the denticity of the ligand. For oxalate, which is bidentate, $\\delta=2$. The number of ligands required, $n$, is obtained by filling all six sites with ligands that each occupy two sites:\n$$\nN_{\\text{coord}}=6,\\quad \\delta=2,\\quad n=\\frac{N_{\\text{coord}}}{\\delta}=\\frac{6}{2}=3.\n$$\nTo find the net charge of the complex, sum the charges of the central metal and the ligands.
