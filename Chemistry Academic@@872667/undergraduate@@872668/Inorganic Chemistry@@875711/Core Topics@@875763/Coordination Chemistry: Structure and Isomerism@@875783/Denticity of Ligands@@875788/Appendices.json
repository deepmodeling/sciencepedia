By working with the oxalate ligand ($C_2O_4^{2-}$), a common bidentate chelator, you will apply the definition of denticity to determine the geometry and overall charge of a coordination complex [@problem_id:2244657]. Mastering this skill is the first step toward understanding the structure and properties of these fascinating compounds.", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, a central metal ion binds to one or more surrounding molecules or ions, known as ligands, to form a coordination complex. The number of points of attachment from the ligands to the central atom is called the coordination number. Some ligands are capable of forming more than one bond with the central metal ion; this property is known as denticity. For instance, a bidentate ligand is a ligand that can form two bonds to a central metal ion.\n\nConsider the formation of a complex ion where a single central cobalt(III) ion ($Co^{3+}$) is coordinated by three oxalate ions ($C_2O_4^{2-}$). In this complex, each oxalate ion functions as a bidentate ligand.\n\nDetermine two properties of the resulting complex ion: first, the coordination number of the central cobalt(III) ion, and second, the overall electrical charge of the entire complex ion. Report your final answer as a pair of integers in the format (Coordination Number, Overall Charge).", "solution": "We identify the ligands and their denticity, then compute the coordination number and the overall charge.\n\nEach oxalate ion, $C_2O_4^{2-}$, is bidentate, meaning it donates two electron pairs to the metal center. With three oxalate ligands coordinated to a single cobalt(III) ion, the number of donor atoms attached to the metal is\n$$\n\\text{Coordination number} = 3 \\times 2 = 6.\n$$\n\nTo find the overall charge $Q$ of the complex ion, we add the charge of the central metal ion to the total charge contributed by the ligands. The cobalt center is $Co^{3+}$, so $q_{\\text{metal}} = +3$. Each oxalate ligand has charge $-2$, so for three ligands the total ligand charge is\n$$\nq_{\\text{ligands}} = 3 \\times (-2) = -6.\n$$\nThus, the overall charge is\n$$\nQ = q_{\\text{metal}} + q_{\\text{ligands}} = (+3) + (-6) = -3.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the required pair is the coordination number $6$ and the overall charge $-3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}6 & -3\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2244657"}, {"introduction": "Ligand denticity is not always fixed; it can be a dynamic property that depends on reaction conditions. This problem explores the concept of variable denticity using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a ligand famous for its flexibility [@problem_id:2244616]. Instead of assuming its maximum potential denticity, you must use the provided experimental details to deduce the actual number of donor atoms bound to the metal, reinforcing that denticity describes the *observed* bonding in a specific complex.", "problem": "Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, commonly known as $H_4EDTA$, is a versatile chelating agent. Its molecular structure contains two amine nitrogen atoms and four carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional groups. When fully deprotonated, it forms the ethylenediaminetetraacetate anion, $EDTA^{4-}$, which possesses six potential donor sites (two nitrogen atoms and four oxygen atoms from the carboxylate groups) and can act as a hexadentate ligand.\n\nIn a particular synthesis, a coordination complex is formed by reacting one equivalent of a cobalt(III) salt, which provides the $Co^{3+}$ cation, with one equivalent of the fully deprotonated ligand, $EDTA^{4-}$. The reaction is conducted in a slightly acidic aqueous medium. Detailed spectroscopic analysis of the isolated product reveals the following: the ligand is attached to the central $Co^{3+}$ ion via both of its nitrogen atoms and exactly two of its four carboxylate groups. The two remaining carboxylate groups are not involved in coordination and are found to be protonated (i.e., they exist in their -COOH form). It is also confirmed that no other molecules, including water, are part of the coordination sphere.\n\nBased on this experimental evidence, determine the denticity of the ligand in this specific complex and the overall net charge of the resulting complex ion. Your answer should be a pair of integers, representing the denticity and the net charge, in that order.", "solution": "The denticity of a ligand is the number of donor atoms from that ligand that simultaneously coordinate to a single metal center. Fully deprotonated $EDTA^{4-}$ can, in principle, bind through six donor atoms (two nitrogens and four carboxylate oxygens). However, the experimental evidence here states that the ligand binds via both nitrogen atoms and exactly two of its four carboxylate groups, with the remaining two carboxylate groups uncoordinated and protonated as $-COOH$, and that no other molecules are in the coordination sphere.\n\nTherefore, the number of donor atoms actually coordinated is $2$ (from the two nitrogens) plus $2$ (from two carboxylate oxygens), yielding a denticity of $4$ for this complex.\n\nNext, determine the overall charge of the complex ion. The metal ion is $Co^{3+}$, with charge $+3$. The ligand portion that coordinates consists of two neutral amines and two deprotonated carboxylate groups; each deprotonated carboxylate group carries charge $-1$. The two uncoordinated carboxylate groups are protonated as $-COOH$ and thus neutral. Hence, the net charge on the bound ligand fragment is\n$$-1 + (-1) = -2.$$\nThe overall charge on the complex ion is the sum of the metal and ligand charges:\n$$Q_{\\text{complex}} = (+3) + (-2) = +1.$$\n\nThus, the denticity is $4$, and the net charge is $+1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}4 & 1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2244616"}, {"introduction": "Why do some multi-donor ligands form stable chelate rings while others do not? This practice moves beyond simple counting to explore the underlying energetic principles that govern chelation [@problem_id:2244648]. By comparing ethylenediamine and hydrazine, you will investigate how molecular structure and the resulting ring strain dictate a ligand's ability to act as an effective chelating agent, providing deeper insight into the stability of coordination complexes.", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, a ligand is a molecule or ion that binds to a central metal atom to form a coordination complex. The number of donor atoms in a single ligand that bind to the metal is known as its denticity. Ligands that can bind to a metal through two or more donor atoms are called polydentate ligands. When a polydentate ligand binds to a single central metal atom using two or more of its donor atoms, it forms a ring-like structure, a process known as chelation. This typically results in a more stable complex compared to one formed with analogous monodentate ligands, an observation known as the chelate effect.\n\nConsider two simple diamine ligands: ethylenediamine ($H_2N-CH_2-CH_2-NH_2$) and hydrazine ($H_2N-NH_2$). Both molecules possess two nitrogen atoms, each with a lone pair of electrons capable of acting as a donor site. Ethylenediamine is a classic example of an excellent chelating ligand, readily forming a stable five-membered ring with a metal ion. In contrast, hydrazine almost exclusively acts as a monodentate ligand (binding through only one nitrogen atom) or as a bridging ligand (linking two different metal centers), and it is considered a very poor chelating agent.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the primary chemical reason for hydrazine's inability to act as an effective chelating ligand?\n\nA. The lone pairs on the adjacent nitrogen atoms in hydrazine create significant electrostatic repulsion, preventing them from coordinating to the same metal center.\nB. The nitrogen atoms in hydrazine are $sp$ hybridized, resulting in a linear geometry that is incompatible with forming a chelate ring.\nC. Hydrazine is highly unstable and readily decomposes in the presence of metal ions, preventing the formation of any stable complex.\nD. When hydrazine binds to a single metal center through both nitrogen atoms, it forms a three-membered chelate ring that is subject to extremely high angle strain.\nE. Hydrazine is a powerful reducing agent, and its tendency to reduce the metal ion is overwhelmingly favored over the process of chelation.", "solution": "Chelation requires a ligand to bind a single metal center through two donor atoms so that a ring containing the metal and the donor-bearing atoms is formed. The stability of such chelates depends strongly on the size of the ring and the associated bite angle at the metal; five- and six-membered chelate rings are favored because they impose bite angles that are compatible with common coordination geometries, minimizing angular strain.\n\nFor ethylenediamine, simultaneous coordination through both nitrogen atoms yields a five-membered chelate ring, conventionally counted as M–N–C–C–N, which accommodates a bite angle that is close to the preferred range for square-planar and octahedral metal centers, and thus is strongly stabilized.\n\nIf hydrazine were to bind bidentate to a single metal through both nitrogen atoms, the smallest ring that could be formed is M–N–N, which is a three-membered ring. Three-membered chelate rings impose extremely small bite angles at the metal (on the order of that associated with a three-membered cycle), leading to very high angle strain and poor orbital overlap between the metal and both donor atoms simultaneously. This severe geometric penalty renders such a chelation mode highly unfavorable. Consequently, hydrazine instead binds as a monodentate ligand through one nitrogen or acts as a bridging ligand, using each nitrogen to bind different metal centers and thereby avoiding the strained three-membered ring.\n\nAlternative explanations are not primary: the presence of two lone pairs on adjacent nitrogens (A) does not inherently prevent chelation, as shown by other diamines; the nitrogen atoms in hydrazine are approximately pyramidal and best described as near $sp^{3}$, not $sp$ (so B is incorrect); hydrazine does form stable complexes and is not generally too unstable to coordinate (C is incorrect); and while hydrazine can be a reducing agent, reduction does not universally preclude chelation and does not specifically explain the failure to form a bidentate complex (E is not the primary reason).\n\nTherefore, the principal chemical reason hydrazine fails to act as an effective chelating ligand is the prohibitive angle strain associated with forming a three-membered chelate ring when both nitrogens bind to the same metal center.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2244648"}]}
