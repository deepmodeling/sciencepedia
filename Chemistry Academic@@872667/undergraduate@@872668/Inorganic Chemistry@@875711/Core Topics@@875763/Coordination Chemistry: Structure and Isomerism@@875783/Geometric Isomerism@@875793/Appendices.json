In a square planar coordination environment, the four coordination sites split into two pairs of trans positions. Therefore, specifying which two ligands are trans to each other fully determines the isomer; any remaining arrangement differences are related by rotation in space and are not distinct isomers.\n\nLet the ligands be denoted by $A=\\text{NH}_{3}$, $B=\\text{py}$, $C=\\text{Cl}^{-}$, and $D=\\text{Br}^{-}$. The number of distinct isomers equals the number of ways to partition $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$ into two unordered trans pairs. This is the number of perfect matchings on four labeled elements:\n$$\n\\text{Number of isomers}=\\frac{(2\\cdot 2)!}{2^{2}\\,2!}=3.\n$$\nEquivalently, one can choose which ligand is trans to $A$; there are $3$ choices (trans to $B$, trans to $C$, or trans to $D$), and once that is fixed the remaining two ligands must be trans to each other, yielding exactly $3$ distinct arrangements:\n- $\\text{NH}_{3}\\,\\text{trans}\\,\\text{py}$ (and hence $\\text{Cl}^{-}\\,\\text{trans}\\,\\text{Br}^{-}$),\n- $\\text{NH}_{3}\\,\\text{trans}\\,\\text{Cl}^{-}$ (and hence $\\text{py}\\,\\text{trans}\\,\\text{Br}^{-}$),\n- $\\text{NH}_{3}\\,\\text{trans}\\,\\text{Br}^{-}$ (and hence $\\text{py}\\,\\text{trans}\\,\\text{Cl}^{-}$).\n\nNo additional distinct arrangements arise from different cis orderings around the square, because these are interconverted by rigid rotations. Furthermore, square planar complexes of this type are planar and achiral with these achiral monodentate ligands, so there is no optical isomerism to double the count.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct geometric isomers is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2255041"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of relative ligand positions, this exercise explores *cis-trans* isomerism in the more complex octahedral geometry.
