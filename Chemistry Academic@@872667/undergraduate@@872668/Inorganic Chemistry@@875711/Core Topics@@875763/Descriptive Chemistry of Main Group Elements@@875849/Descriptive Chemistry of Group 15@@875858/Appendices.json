This first exercise challenges you to apply your knowledge of oxidation states and charge neutrality to determine the empirical formula and bonding nature of a compound formed between a Group 2 metal and the Group 15 element, nitrogen. Mastering this allows you to anticipate the composition of simple binary compounds without prior knowledge of the specific reaction outcome [@problem_id:2245719].", "problem": "In the synthesis of advanced ceramic materials, a common precursor is formed by reacting a highly reactive metal with a nonmetal gas at elevated temperatures.

Magnesium is an alkaline earth metal (group 2) that forms a cation with oxidation state $+2$, i.e., $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, by losing its two valence electrons. Nitrogen, in forming nitrides, typically attains the oxidation state $-3$ as $\\mathrm{N}^{3-}$ by gaining three electrons to achieve an octet.\n\nLet the empirical formula be $\\mathrm{Mg}_{x}\\mathrm{N}_{y}$. Charge neutrality requires that the total positive charge from magnesium cations equals the total negative charge from nitride anions:\n$$\n2x - 3y = 0.\n$$\nSolving for the smallest positive integers, we obtain\n$$\n2x = 3y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 3k,\\; y = 2k,\n$$\nand choosing $k=1$ gives\n$$\nx=3,\\quad y=2,\n$$\nso the empirical formula is $\\mathrm{Mg}_{3}\\mathrm{N}_{2}$.\n\nRegarding bonding, magnesium (a highly electropositive metal) and nitrogen (a relatively electronegative nonmetal) favor electron transfer producing $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{N}^{3-}$ ions. The large lattice energy stabilizes the ionic solid.

This practice focuses on using Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory to deduce the geometry of dinitrogen monoxide, $N_2O$, a common Group 15 oxide. By analyzing its structure, you can then determine whether the molecule possesses a net dipole moment, a property crucial for its interactions in biological and atmospheric systems [@problem_id:2245790].", "problem": "Dinitrogen monoxide ($N_2O$), a compound from the nitrogen group, is widely known by its common name, \"laughing gas,\" due to the euphoric effects it produces upon inhalation. It serves as an important anesthetic in dentistry and surgery. Beyond its medical applications, $N_2O$ is also a significant and long-lived greenhouse gas. A complete understanding of its atmospheric chemistry and biological interactions requires precise knowledge of its molecular structure and charge distribution.\n\nConsider a single molecule of dinitrogen monoxide.

Linear and polar\n\nB. Linear and nonpolar\n\nC. Bent and polar\n\nD. Bent and nonpolar\n\nE. Trigonal planar and nonpolar", "solution": "We first determine the total number of valence electrons. Each nitrogen contributes 5 and oxygen contributes 6, so the total is $5 + 5 + 6 = 16$ valence electrons.\n\nWe choose the skeleton N–N–O with the central atom being nitrogen, since oxygen is typically terminal in such triatomic species. Possible resonance structures must distribute the 16 electrons while satisfying octets and minimizing formal charges. The most significant resonance structure is the one in which the terminal nitrogen forms a triple bond to the central nitrogen and the central nitrogen forms a single bond to oxygen, with the oxygen bearing the negative charge and the central nitrogen bearing the positive charge. Using the formal charge formula\n$$\n\\mathrm{FC} = V - \\left(L + \\frac{B}{2}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the number of valence electrons of the atom, $L$ is the number of nonbonding electrons, and $B$ is the number of bonding electrons around the atom, we find for this structure:\n- Terminal nitrogen: one lone pair and a triple bond gives $\\mathrm{FC} = 5 - \\left(2 + \\frac{6}{2}\\right) = 0$.\n- Central nitrogen: four bonds and no lone pairs gives $\\mathrm{FC} = 5 - \\left(0 + \\frac{8}{2}\\right) = +1$.\n- Oxygen: three lone pairs and a single bond gives $\\mathrm{FC} = 6 - \\left(6 + \\frac{2}{2}\\right) = -1$.\nThis placement of negative charge on oxygen (the most electronegative atom) makes this resonance structure the dominant contributor.\n\nAccording to VSEPR, the central nitrogen in this dominant structure has two regions of electron density (one bond to the terminal nitrogen and one bond to oxygen) and no lone pairs, corresponding to an $\\mathrm{AX}_{2}$ arrangement, which is linear with a bond angle of $180^{\\circ}$. Therefore, the molecular geometry is linear.\n\nTo assess the net dipole moment, note that even though the geometry is linear, the two terminal atoms are different (terminal nitrogen versus oxygen), and the two bonds have different polarities and magnitudes of bond dipoles. Consequently, the bond dipoles do not cancel. The electron density is drawn more strongly toward oxygen, so the molecule has a nonzero net dipole moment. Therefore, the molecule is linear and polar.\n\nHence, the correct choice is linear and polar.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2245790"}, {"introduction": "Moving from structure to reactivity, we now explore one of the hallmark reactions of the p-block elements: hydrolysis.
