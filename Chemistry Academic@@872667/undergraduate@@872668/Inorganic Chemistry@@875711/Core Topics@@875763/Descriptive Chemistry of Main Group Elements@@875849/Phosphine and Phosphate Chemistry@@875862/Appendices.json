To probe the mechanism of this fundamental transformation, a chemist performs an isotopic labeling experiment. The reaction under study is the hydrolysis of one ester linkage of triethyl phosphate, $(CH_3CH_2O)_3PO$, to yield the diethyl phosphate anion and ethanol. The hydrolysis is carried out using hydroxide ions that have been isotopically enriched with $^{18}O$. For the purpose of this problem, assume the nucleophile is exclusively $H^{18}O^-$ and that any subsequent protonation events involve the un-labeled bulk solvent, $H_2O$.\n\nTwo primary mechanistic pathways are considered plausible:\n1.  **Pathway 1:** A nucleophilic attack by the hydroxide ion at the electrophilic phosphorus center, followed by the cleavage of a phosphorus-oxygen (P-O) bond.\n2.  **Pathway 2:** A bimolecular nucleophilic substitution ($S_N2$) reaction where the hydroxide ion attacks the $\\alpha$-carbon of one of the ethyl groups, followed by the cleavage of a carbon-oxygen (C-O) bond.\n\nBased on the known reactivity of simple primary alkyl phosphate esters, which of the following options correctly identifies the major isotopically labeled organic product that would be isolated from this experiment?\n\nA. $CH_3CH_2^{18}OH$\n\nB. $[(CH_3CH_2O)_2P(O)(^{18}O)]^-$\n\nC. $[(CH_3CH_2O)(CH_3CH_2^{18}O)PO_2]^-$\n\nD.

Symbolically:\n$$\n(CH_{3}CH_{2}O)_{3}PO + H^{18}O^{-} \\longrightarrow [\\text{TBP intermediate}] \\longrightarrow [(CH_{3}CH_{2}O)_{2}P(O)(^{18}O)]^{-} + CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}\n$$\nThe expelled $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}$ is then protonated by bulk water (unlabeled) to give unlabeled ethanol:\n$$\nCH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-} + H_{2}O \\longrightarrow CH_{3}CH_{2}OH + HO^{-}\n$$\nCrucially, the $^{18}O$ from $H^{18}O^{-}$ remains bound to phosphorus as a non-bridging oxygen in the diethyl phosphate anion, yielding $[(CH_{3}CH_{2}O)_{2}P(O)(^{18}O)]^{-}$.\n\nPathway 2 ($S_{N}2$ at carbon, C–O cleavage):\nAn $S_{N}2$ displacement at the $\\alpha$-carbon of an ethyl group would produce labeled ethanol and a diethyl phosphate anion:\n$$\nH^{18}O^{-} + CH_{3}CH_{2}O\\text{-}P(O)(OCH_{2}CH_{3})_{2} \\longrightarrow CH_{3}CH_{2}^{18}OH + [(CH_{3}CH_{2}O)_{2}PO_{2}]^{-}\n$$\n\nNow apply the known reactivity of simple primary alkyl phosphate esters. For phosphate triesters, nucleophilic substitution occurs predominantly at phosphorus rather than at carbon. The phosphorus center is strongly electrophilic due to the phosphoryl group, and the associative mechanism at phosphorus leading to P–O cleavage is kinetically favored. In contrast, $S_{N}2$ attack at carbon is disfavored because the leaving group would be a dialkyl phosphate anion, $[(RO)_{2}PO_{2}]^{-}$, which is a relatively poor leaving group in $S_{N}2$ at carbon compared to alkoxide departure in the P-centered pathway. Therefore, under alkaline hydrolysis conditions, the dominant pathway is attack at phosphorus with expulsion of ethoxide.\n\nConsequences for isotopic labeling:\n- In Pathway 1 (dominant), the $^{18}O$ from $H^{18}O^{-}$ becomes the non-bridging oxygen of the diethyl phosphate anion, giving $[(CH_{3}CH_{2}O)_{2}P(O)(^{18}O)]^{-}$; the ethanol formed is protonated from unlabeled $H_{2}O$ and remains unlabeled.\n- In Pathway 2 (minor/negligible), labeled ethanol $CH_{3}CH_{2}^{18}OH$ would form; however, this pathway is not favored for simple primary alkyl phosphate esters.\n\nTherefore, the major isotopically labeled organic product is the diethyl phosphate anion labeled at a non-bridging oxygen, corresponding to option B: $[(CH_{3}CH_{2}O)_{2}P(O)(^{18}O)]^{-}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2280476"}]}
