A primary amine has one carbon substituent and two hydrogens on nitrogen, a secondary amine has two carbon substituents and one hydrogen on nitrogen, and a tertiary amine has three carbon substituents and no N–H bonds. The requirement specifies a tertiary amine, which must therefore have the nitrogen bonded to three carbon groups and no hydrogen.\n\nExamine each option:\nA. Aniline has the structure $C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}$, which features one aryl group and two hydrogens on nitrogen, so it is a primary amine.\nB.
