This problem focuses on the trend in sulfate solubility for Group 2 elements, a crucial concept with practical applications like industrial water treatment. By comparing the effectiveness of magnesium and barium ions for precipitating sulfate, you will see how the solubility product constant, $K_{sp}$, provides a quantitative basis for choosing the right reagent [@problem_id:2246928].", "problem": "An environmental chemist is tasked with removing toxic sulfate ions ($SO_4^{2-}$) from a sample of industrial wastewater. The goal is to precipitate the sulfate as an insoluble salt to achieve the lowest possible residual sulfate concentration in the treated water. The chemist has access to aqueous solutions of two different Group 2 nitrate salts of equal concentration: magnesium nitrate, $Mg(NO_3)_2$, and barium nitrate, $Ba(NO_3)_2$.\n\nTo make an informed decision, the chemist consults a handbook and finds the following solubility product constants ($K_{sp}$) at the operating temperature of the treatment facility:\n- For magnesium sulfate ($MgSO_4$): $K_{sp} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$\n- For barium sulfate ($BaSO_4$): $K_{sp} = 1.1 \\times 10^{-10}$\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements provides the correct choice of reagent and the scientifically valid reason for its superior effectiveness?\n\nA. Magnesium nitrate is more effective because magnesium is a lighter element, and its ions have higher ionic mobility, leading to faster precipitation.\n\nB.

CaCO₃", "solution": "We analyze each observation using established qualitative inorganic analysis principles.\n\nFirst, the flame test: a persistent brick-red color is characteristic of the calcium ion. The underlying principle is that thermal excitation of metal ions produces emission at characteristic wavelengths; calcium gives a brick-red emission, whereas strontium gives crimson, barium gives apple green, sodium gives yellow, and magnesium effectively gives no color. Therefore, the cation is most plausibly $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$. This immediately favors calcium-containing options and excludes $\\mathrm{Mg(OH)_{2}}$ and $\\mathrm{BaCl_{2}}$ based on the flame colors of $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ (no color) and $\\mathrm{Ba^{2+}}$ (green), and also excludes $\\mathrm{SrO}$ (crimson for $\\mathrm{Sr^{2+}}$).\n\nSecond, the substance is sparingly soluble in water and forms a basic solution. A sparingly soluble calcium hydroxide dissolves according to\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ca(OH)_{2}(s) \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+}(aq) + 2\\,OH^{-}(aq)},\n$$\nproducing a basic solution due to the presence of $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$. Its low solubility is captured by a small solubility product $K_{sp}$, without requiring any numerical substitution. Calcium carbonate dissolves as\n$$\n\\mathrm{CaCO_{3}(s) \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+}(aq) + CO_{3}^{2-}(aq)},\n$$\nand $\\mathrm{CO_{3}^{2-}}$ hydrolyzes water to generate some $\\mathrm{OH^{-}}$, so a saturated solution can be slightly basic. However, the decisive discrimination comes from the carbon dioxide test.\n\nThird, when $\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ is bubbled through a clear, saturated aqueous solution of the substance, a milky white precipitate forms.

The net reaction in limewater is\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ca(OH)_{2}(aq) + CO_{2}(g) \\to CaCO_{3}(s) + H_{2}O(l)}.\n$$\nThis is the classical limewater test for carbon dioxide.\n\nBy contrast, if the original solid were $\\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$, bubbling $\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ through its saturated solution would shift equilibria toward bicarbonate and increase solubility rather than produce a precipitate:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CaCO_{3}(s) + CO_{2}(aq) + H_{2}O(l) \\to Ca(HCO_{3})_{2}(aq)}.\n$$\nThus a milky precipitate upon introducing $\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ into the saturated solution uniquely supports $\\mathrm{Ca(OH)_{2}}$ over $\\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$.\n\nCombining all observations—brick-red flame (calcium), sparing solubility with a basic solution, and the limewater test yielding a milky $\\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ precipitate—the most plausible identity is calcium hydroxide.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2246939"}]}
