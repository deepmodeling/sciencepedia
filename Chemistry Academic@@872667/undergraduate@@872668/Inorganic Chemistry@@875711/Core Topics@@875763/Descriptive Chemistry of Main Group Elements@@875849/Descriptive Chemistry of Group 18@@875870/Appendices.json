The first crucial step after synthesis is characterization—determining exactly what has been made. This practice problem places you in the role of a research chemist, using raw experimental mass data to determine the empirical formula of a xenon fluoride compound [@problem_id:2246656]. By applying the law of conservation of mass and the concept of the mole, you will practice a fundamental skill essential for all of chemistry.", "problem": "In a high-pressure synthesis experiment, a team of chemists investigates the reactivity of noble gases. They place a sample of pure xenon (Xe) with a mass of 1.550 g into a specialized reaction chamber. An excess of fluorine gas is then introduced. The mixture is subjected to high pressure and elevated temperature, leading to the formation of a single, stable, solid crystalline product, which is a binary compound of xenon and fluorine. After the reaction is complete, all unreacted fluorine is removed from the chamber. The final mass of the pure solid product is measured to be 2.447 g.\n\nGiven the atomic molar mass of xenon is 131.29 g/mol and the atomic molar mass of fluorine is 18.998 g/mol, determine the empirical formula of the xenon fluoride compound.", "solution": "The solid product mass is greater than the initial xenon mass by the mass of fluorine incorporated. The mass of fluorine in the product is computed by mass conservation:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{F}}=m_{\\text{product}}-m_{\\mathrm{Xe,initial}}=2.447-1.550=0.897\\ \\mathrm{g}.\n$$\nConvert masses to moles using molar masses:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{Xe}}=\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{Xe,initial}}}{M_{\\mathrm{Xe}}}=\\frac{1.550\\ \\mathrm{g}}{131.29\\ \\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}}}\\approx 0.011806\\ \\mathrm{mol},\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{F}}=\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{F}}}{M_{\\mathrm{F}}}=\\frac{0.897\\ \\mathrm{g}}{18.998\\ \\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}}}\\approx 0.047216\\ \\mathrm{mol}.\n$$\nDetermine the simplest whole-number ratio by dividing by the smaller amount (that of xenon):\n$$\n\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{F}}}{n_{\\mathrm{Xe}}}=\\frac{0.047216}{0.011806}\\approx 4.000.\n$$\nThus the empirical formula corresponds to one xenon atom per four fluorine atoms:\n$$\n\\mathrm{XeF_{4}}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{XeF}_4}$$", "id": "2246656"}, {"introduction": "Knowing a molecule's formula is only part of the story; its three-dimensional structure dictates its physical properties and chemical behavior. This exercise challenges you to apply Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory to predict the molecular geometry of xenon oxytetrafluoride, $XeOF_4$ [@problem_id:2246673]. This practice is key to developing your ability to translate a 2D chemical formula into a 3D molecular shape, a cornerstone of understanding molecular function.", "problem": "The discovery that noble gases are not entirely inert opened a new field of chemistry. Xenon, in particular, forms a variety of fluorides and oxides. Consider the molecule xenon oxytetrafluoride ($XeOF_4$), a stable but reactive compound. Based on the principles of molecular structure and valence shell electron pair repulsion, determine the most plausible three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms in this molecule. Select the correct molecular geometry from the options provided below.\n\nA. Trigonal bipyramidal\n\nB. Octahedral\n\nC. See-saw\n\nD. Pentagonal planar\n\nE. Square pyramidal", "solution": "We apply Lewis structure construction and VSEPR.\n\n1) Count valence electrons: xenon contributes $8$, oxygen $6$, and four fluorine atoms contribute $4 \\times 7 = 28$. Total valence electrons are $8 + 6 + 28 = 42$.\n\n2) Make a skeleton with Xe as the central atom bonded to O and to four F atoms. Initial single bonds (five sigma bonds) account for $5 \\times 2 = 10$ electrons, leaving $42 - 10 = 32$ electrons to place as lone pairs.\n\n3) Complete octets on terminal atoms. Each F requires $6$ electrons as three lone pairs, so $4 \\times 6 = 24$ electrons are placed on fluorines, leaving $32 - 24 = 8$ electrons. Placing $6$ electrons on O (as three lone pairs) would complete its octet with a single bond, leaving $2$ electrons for Xe as one lone pair. This single-bond structure gives formal charges: on O, $\\text{FC} = 6 - (6 + 1) = -1$; on Xe, $\\text{FC} = 8 - (2 + 5) = +1$. To minimize formal charges, convert one lone pair on O into a second bond to Xe, forming an $\\text{Xe=O}$ double bond. Then O has two lone pairs, Xe retains one lone pair, and all atoms have formal charge $0$.\n\n4) Determine electron-domain and molecular geometry at Xe. Around Xe there are $5$ bonding regions (four $\\text{Xe-F}$ single bonds and one $\\text{Xe=O}$ double bond, which counts as one region in VSEPR) and $1$ lone pair, giving a steric number of $6$. VSEPR for $AX_5E$ with $6$ electron domains has an octahedral electron-domain geometry and a square pyramidal molecular geometry (the lone pair occupies one octahedral vertex, leaving a square pyramid formed by the five bonded atoms). The $\\text{Xe=O}$ bond is typically placed trans to the lone pair, consistent with the stronger repulsion of a multiple bond, but the molecular shape is square pyramidal.\n\nTherefore, the correct molecular geometry is square pyramidal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2246673"}, {"introduction": "The compounds of xenon are notable for their powerful reactivity, particularly as oxidizing agents.
