The steric number is the total number of electron domains around the central atom and determines the electron-domain geometry; the presence of lone pairs modifies the molecular geometry and typically compresses bond angles relative to the ideal values.\n\nFor $SO_{3}$:\n- Count electron domains on sulfur: three S–O bonding domains (resonance among S=O bonds leads to three equivalent bonding regions) and zero lone pairs on sulfur. Thus the steric number is $3$.\n- VSEPR with steric number $3$ and $0$ lone pairs gives a trigonal planar molecular geometry with ideal bond angles of approximately $120^{\\circ}$ around sulfur.\n\nFor $SO_{3}^{2-}$ (sulfite ion):\n- Count total valence electrons: sulfur contributes 6, each of the three oxygens contributes 6, and the 2- charge adds 2, for a total of $6 + 3(6) + 2 = 26$ valence electrons. The Lewis structure places the sulfur atom in the center. After forming three S-O single bonds and completing the octets on the oxygen atoms, the remaining two electrons are placed on the central sulfur atom as a lone pair. Thus, the central sulfur atom has three bonding domains and one lone pair, for a steric number of 4.\n- VSEPR with steric number $4$ and $1$ lone pair gives a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry (electron-domain geometry is tetrahedral, but one vertex is a lone pair).\n- Lone pair–bond pair repulsions are greater than bond pair–bond pair repulsions, so the O–S–O bond angles are compressed relative to the ideal tetrahedral angle, making them less than $109.5^{\\circ}$.\n\nTherefore, $SO_{3}$ is trigonal planar, and the O–S–O bond angle in $SO_{3}^{2-}$ is less than $109.5^{\\circ}$, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2290681"}, {"introduction": "While the concept of an average oxidation state is useful for bookkeeping in redox reactions, it can obscure the distinct electronic environment of each atom within a complex ion.

While a simple algebraic calculation can often yield an average oxidation state for an element in a polyatomic ion, this value can be a non-integer and may not reflect the true integer oxidation states of individual atoms, which depend critically on their specific bonding environments.\n\nConsider the tetrathionate ion, $S_4O_6^{2-}$.

The total oxidation state equals the net charge:\n$$\nx_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}+6(-2)=-2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}=+10.\n$$\nThis gives an average sulfur oxidation state of $+\\frac{10}{4}=+2.5$, but individual sulfur atoms need not share this average.\n\nThe structure of tetrathionate is a chain of four sulfur atoms with a $\\mathrm{SO}_{3}$ group bound to each terminal sulfur. Thus there are two types of sulfur:\n- Two terminal sulfur atoms, each bonded to three oxygen atoms and to one sulfur atom.\n- Two inner sulfur atoms, each bonded only to sulfur atoms (to one terminal sulfur and to the other inner sulfur).\n\nApply the electronegativity-based rules for oxidation states:\n- In S–O bonds, oxygen (being more electronegative) takes the bonding electrons; this contributes positive oxidation state to sulfur.\n- In S–S bonds (homonuclear), the bonding electrons are split equally, so such bonds do not affect oxidation states.\n\nTherefore, each inner sulfur, having only S–S bonds, has oxidation state $0$. Let $a$ be the oxidation state of each terminal sulfur and $b$ that of each inner sulfur. Then\n$$\n2a+2b=+10 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a+b=5.\n$$\nWith $b=0$ from the S–S-only environment, it follows that $a=5$.
