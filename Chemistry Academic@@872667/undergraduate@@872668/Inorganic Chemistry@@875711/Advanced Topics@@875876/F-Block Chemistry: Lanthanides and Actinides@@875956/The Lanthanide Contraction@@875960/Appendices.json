A crucial ligand in coordination chemistry and medical imaging is DOTA, an acronym for the macrocyclic chelator 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid. When deprotonated, $DOTA^{4-}$ forms highly stable 1:1 complexes with lanthanide ions, with the general formula $[Ln(DOTA)]^-$. In these complexes, the lanthanide ion is coordinated by the four nitrogen atoms and four oxygen atoms from the carboxylate groups of the DOTA ligand.\n\nConsider the two complexes formed by the first and last members of the lanthanide series: $[La(DOTA)]^-$ and $[Lu(DOTA)]^-$.

The central concept is the lanthanide contraction, which arises from poor shielding by the $4f$ electrons as the atomic number increases from La to Lu.\n\nDefine the effective nuclear charge on the valence shell as\n$$\nZ_{\\text{eff}}=Z-S,\n$$\nwhere $Z$ is the atomic number and $S$ is the shielding constant. Across the lanthanide series, electrons are added to the $4f$ subshell. The $4f$ orbitals have radial distributions that shield poorly compared to $s$ and $p$ orbitals. Consequently, as $Z$ increases from La to Lu, $S$ does not increase proportionally, so $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ experienced by the outer orbitals increases.

Therefore, a smaller $r_{\\text{ionic}}$ for $Lu^{3+}$ leads to shorter $Ln$–N and $Ln$–O bonds in $[Lu(DOTA)]^{-}$ relative to $[La(DOTA)]^{-}$. The reason is not the mass of Lu (mass does not determine bond length) nor a rigid cavity enforcing identical distances (DOTA is conformationally adaptable and accommodates the ionic radius trend). It is also not due to increased electron-electron repulsion in a filled $4f$ shell; the dominant effect is the increased $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ from poor $4f$ shielding that causes the lanthanide contraction.\n\nThus, the correct statement is that $[Lu(DOTA)]^{-}$ has shorter bonds because the filling of the $4f$ orbitals provides poor shielding, leading to a higher effective nuclear charge that contracts the ion, which corresponds to option B.

This final problem challenges you to think about how the changing size of the $Ln^{3+}$ cation affects the bond character in a series of metal oxides. By considering the concept of polarizing power, you will see how the contraction leads to a predictable trend in the covalent character of the metal-oxygen bond across the lanthanide series. [@problem_id:2294788]", "problem": "The lanthanide series of elements, from Lanthanum (La, Z=57) to Lutetium (Lu, Z=71), are characterized by the filling of the 4f electron subshell. A prominent chemical feature of these elements is their stable +3 oxidation state, leading to the formation of a series of sesquioxides with the general formula $M_2\\text{O}_3$, where M is a lanthanide metal.\n\nConsider the trend in the chemical bonding properties of these oxides across the series. As one progresses from lanthanum(III) oxide ($\\text{La}_2\\text{O}_3$) to lutetium(III) oxide ($\\text{Lu}_2\\text{O}_3$), how does the nature of the metal-oxygen (M-O) bond change? Select the statement that correctly describes the trend and provides the most accurate underlying chemical principle.\n\nA. The M-O bond becomes progressively more ionic. This is because the decreasing size of the $M^{3+}$ cation leads to a lower polarizing power, thereby strengthening the purely electrostatic interaction with the oxide anion.\n\nB. The M-O bond becomes progressively more covalent. This is because the decreasing size of the $M^{3+}$ cation leads to a greater charge density and thus a greater polarizing power, increasing the sharing of electron density with the oxide anion.\n\nC. The M-O bond character remains essentially constant across the series. Since all the cations have the same $+3$ charge and belong to the same f-block series, their fundamental bonding characteristics with a given anion like $\\text{O}^{2-}$ are nearly identical.\n\nD. The M-O bond becomes progressively more covalent. This is because the ionization energy of the lanthanide metal required to form the $M^{3+}$ cation increases significantly, which in turn causes the resulting oxide to favor electron sharing.\n\nE. The M-O bond becomes progressively more ionic. This is because the increasing nuclear charge of the lanthanide atom more effectively stabilizes a closed-shell ionic configuration, discouraging the formation of covalent character.", "solution": "We identify how M–O bond character varies across $M_2\\text{O}_3$ for lanthanides $M^{3+}$ from La to Lu by applying the lanthanide contraction and Fajans' rules. \n\nFirst, across the lanthanide series from La to Lu, the effective nuclear charge on the valence shell increases while the $4f$ electrons shield poorly. This produces the lanthanide contraction, so the ionic radius decreases monotonically:\n$$\nr(\\text{La}^{3+}) > r(\\text{Lu}^{3+}).\n$$\nSecond, according to Fajans' rules, the extent of covalent character in an ionic bond increases with the polarizing power of the cation and the polarizability of the anion. For a given anion $\\text{O}^{2-}$, the dominant variable across the series is the cation’s polarizing power. A standard measure of polarizing power $P$ is proportional to the cation charge $z$ divided by the square of its radius $r$:\n$$\nP \\propto \\frac{z}{r^2}.\n$$\nAcross the lanthanide series, $z=+3$ is constant while $r$ decreases due to the lanthanide contraction. Therefore,\n$$\nP_{\\text{La}^{3+}} < P_{\\text{Lu}^{3+}},\n$$\nso the polarizing power increases from La to Lu. Increased polarizing power of the cation induces greater distortion of the electron cloud of $\\text{O}^{2-}$, enhancing electron density sharing between M and O, i.e., increasing covalent character in the M–O bond.\n\nA closely related viewpoint is that the cationic charge density increases as $r$ decreases; equivalently, the electrostatic field strength near the cation increases, which enhances polarization of the anion and thus covalency. Additionally, the slight increase in electronegativity across the series is consistent with a small increase in covalent character. Empirically, this corresponds with decreasing basicity of the oxides from La to Lu, which is a hallmark of increasing M–O covalency.\n\nNow we evaluate the options:\n- Option A is incorrect: decreasing $r$ at constant $z$ increases, not decreases, polarizing power, which increases covalency rather than ionicity.\n- Option B is correct: the decreasing size increases charge density and polarizing power, so the M–O bond becomes progressively more covalent.\n- Option C is incorrect: the lanthanide contraction induces a continuous change in $r$ and thus in polarizing power and bonding character.\n- Option D is incorrect: while ionization energies to form $M^{3+}$ do change across the series, the covalency trend in the solid oxide is governed primarily by cation size and polarizing power with a given anion, not by the formation energetics of the gas-phase cation.\n- Option E is incorrect: increasing nuclear charge, with poor $4f$ shielding, makes the cation smaller and more polarizing, which increases covalency rather than ionicity.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the M–O bond becomes progressively more covalent across the series because the $M^{3+}$ cation becomes smaller, increasing its polarizing power and promoting electron density sharing with $\\text{O}^{2-}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294788"}]}
