The electron configuration is built upon the preceding noble gas, Xenon (Xe, $Z=54$). A neutral Gd atom has $64 - 54 = 10$ valence electrons to be placed in the 4f, 5d, and 6s orbitals. The aufbau principle predicts the filling order. However, Gadolinium is a known exception, favoring a half-filled 4f subshell for added stability. Instead of $[\\text{Xe}]\\,4f^8 6s^2$, its configuration is $[\\text{Xe}]\\,4f^7 5d^1 6s^2$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the ground-state electron configuration of the $Gd^{3+}$ ion.\nTo form the $Gd^{3+}$ ion, we must remove three electrons from the neutral Gd atom. Electrons are removed from the orbitals with the highest principal quantum number first. In this case, we remove the two 6s electrons and the one 5d electron.\n- Removing the two 6s electrons from Gd ($[\\text{Xe}]\\,4f^7 5d^1 6s^2$) gives $Gd^{2+}$ with the configuration $[\\text{Xe}]\\,4f^7 5d^1$.\n- Removing the one 5d electron from $Gd^{2+}$ gives $Gd^{3+}$ with the configuration $[\\text{Xe}]\\,4f^7$.\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of unpaired electrons ($n$) in the $Gd^{3+}$ ion.\nThe electron configuration of $Gd^{3+}$ is $[\\text{Xe}]\\,4f^7$. The f subshell has 7 orbitals. According to Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity, electrons will occupy separate orbitals with parallel spins before any pairing occurs. Since there are 7 electrons and 7 f-orbitals, each orbital will be occupied by a single electron.\n- Orbital 1: ↑\n- Orbital 2: ↑\n- Orbital 3: ↑\n- Orbital 4: ↑\n- Orbital 5: ↑\n- Orbital 6: ↑\n- Orbital 7: ↑\nAll 7 electrons are in separate orbitals and are therefore unpaired.\nThus, the number of unpaired electrons is $n=7$.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the spin-only magnetic moment ($\\mu_{so}$).\nThe formula for the spin-only magnetic moment is given as $\\mu_{so} = \\sqrt{n(n+2)}$, with the unit being the Bohr magneton ($\\mu_B$).\nWe substitute the value $n=7$ into the formula:\n$$ \\mu_{so} = \\sqrt{7(7+2)} $$\n$$ \\mu_{so} = \\sqrt{7(9)} $$\n$$ \\mu_{so} = \\sqrt{63} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value and round it to three significant figures as requested.\n$$ \\mu_{so} \\approx 7.93725\\dots \\, \\mu_B $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$ \\mu_{so} \\approx 7.94 \\, \\mu_B $$\n\nThe two values requested are the number of unpaired electrons, $n=7$, and the spin-only magnetic moment, $\\mu_{so} = 7.94 \\, \\mu_B$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 7 & 7.94 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2263551"}, {"introduction": "One of the most important periodic trends in the f-block is the \"lanthanide contraction\"—the gradual decrease in atomic and ionic size across the series. This subtle structural change has significant chemical consequences, affecting properties like bond character and reactivity. This practice [@problem_id:2263571] challenges you to apply the principle of lanthanide contraction to predict how the basicity of lanthanide hydroxides changes from lanthanum ($La$) to lutetium ($Lu$).", "problem": "The lanthanide series of elements, which spans from Lanthanum (La) to Lutetium (Lu), is characterized by the filling of the 4f orbitals. This leads to a systematic trend in their physical and chemical properties, most notably the phenomenon known as the lanthanide contraction, which describes the steady decrease in the radii of the trivalent ions ($Ln^{3+}$) across the series. This trend in ionic size directly influences the nature of the chemical bonds these elements form and, consequently, the properties of their compounds.\n\nConsider the trivalent hydroxides of three lanthanide elements: Lanthanum hydroxide ($La(OH)_3$), Gadolinium hydroxide ($Gd(OH)_3$), and Lutetium hydroxide ($Lu(OH)_3$).

By Fajans’ rules, the covalent character of an $M-O$ bond increases as the cation’s polarizing power increases.\n\nAcross the lanthanide series from La to Lu, the lanthanide contraction leads to a steady decrease in the ionic radius $r$ of $Ln^{3+}$:\n$$r_{\\text{La}^{3+}} > r_{\\text{Gd}^{3+}} > r_{\\text{Lu}^{3+}}.$$\nDefine the ionic potential of the cation as\n$$I = \\frac{z}{r},$$\nwhere $z$ is the charge on the cation.
