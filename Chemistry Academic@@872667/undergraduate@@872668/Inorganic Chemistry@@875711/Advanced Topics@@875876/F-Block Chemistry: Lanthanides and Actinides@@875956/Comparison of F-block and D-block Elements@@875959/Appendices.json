This effect is a cornerstone for understanding the structures of many d-block transition metal complexes but is often considered negligible for f-block lanthanide and actinide complexes.\n\nTo quantify this difference, consider two hypothetical octahedral complexes, Complex D and Complex F, in an identical ligand environment.\n- Complex D contains a d-block metal ion, $M_D$, with a $d^9$ electronic configuration (e.g., Cu(II)).\n- Complex F contains an f-block metal ion, $M_F$, with an $f^1$ electronic configuration (e.g., Ce(III)).\n\nBoth complexes have orbitally degenerate electronic ground states and are therefore susceptible to Jahn-Teller distortion. A simplified model estimates the Jahn-Teller stabilization energy ($E_{JT}$) as a fraction of the overall ligand field splitting energy ($\\Delta$), given by the equation $E_{JT} = f \\cdot \\Delta$, where $f$ is a dimensionless electronic factor dependent on the ground state configuration.\n\n- For the $d^9$ configuration in Complex D, the electronic factor is $f_d = 0.125$, and the ligand field splitting energy is $\\Delta_d = 1.30 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n- For the $f^1$ configuration in Complex F, the electronic factor is $f_f = 0.050$.

A classic example is the acidity of their aqua complexes, where a coordinated water molecule can act as a Brønsted-Lowry acid. This exercise [@problem_id:2240130] challenges you to explain why the hydrated iron(III) ion is a much stronger acid than the hydrated gadolinium(III) ion, delving into how ionic radius and the covalent character of metal-ligand bonds dictate the properties of the complex.", "problem": "The acidity of hydrated metal ions is a key concept in coordination chemistry, describing the tendency of a coordinated water molecule to release a proton. Consider two specific aqua ions, that of iron(III), $[Fe(H_2O)_6]^{3+}$, and that of gadolinium(III), $[Gd(H_2O)_9]^{3+}$. The acid dissociation for the first deprotonation step is quantified by the pKa value. For these two species, the experimentally determined pKa values are approximately 2.2 for $[Fe(H_2O)_6]^{3+}$ and 8.0 for $[Gd(H_2O)_9]^{3+}$. A lower pKa value indicates a stronger acid.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most complete and accurate explanation for the observation that the hydrated iron(III) ion is a significantly stronger acid than the hydrated gadolinium(III) ion?\n\nA. The $Fe^{3+}$ ion has a smaller ionic radius than the $Gd^{3+}$ ion, leading to a higher charge density. Additionally, the Fe-O bonds have greater covalent character due to the participation of d-orbitals in bonding.\n\nB. The $Gd^{3+}$ ion has a higher formal charge than the $Fe^{3+}$ ion, allowing it to better stabilize the negative charge of the resulting hydroxide ligand.\n\nC. The hydrated iron(III) complex has a lower coordination number, which makes the individual coordinated water molecules more acidic.\n\nD. The 4f orbitals of $Gd^{3+}$ are more effective at forming covalent bonds with water ligands than the 3d orbitals of $Fe^{3+}$, which stabilizes the aqua ion and reduces its acidity.\n\nE. Iron is a d-block element, while gadolinium is an f-block element, and as a rule, aqua ions of d-block elements are always more acidic than those of f-block elements with the same charge.", "solution": "The first deprotonation of an aqua ion can be written as\n$$[M(H_{2}O)_{n}]^{3+} + H_{2}O \\rightleftharpoons [M(H_{2}O)_{n-1}(OH)]^{2+} + H_{3}O^{+},$$\nwith acid dissociation constant\n$$K_{a}=\\frac{\\left[[M(H_{2}O)_{n-1}(OH)]^{2+}\\right]\\left[H_{3}O^{+}\\right]}{\\left[[M(H_{2}O)_{n}]^{3+}\\right]}.$$\nA lower $pK_{a}$ indicates a larger $K_{a}$ and thus a stronger tendency for the coordinated water to donate a proton. The markedly lower $pK_{a}$ of $[Fe(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{3+}$ relative to $[Gd(H_{2}O)_{9}]^{3+}$ implies stronger polarization of the coordinated O–H bond by $Fe^{3+}$.\n\nThe acidity of metal aqua ions correlates with the metal’s polarizing power on the coordinated water ligands, which depends primarily on charge density. For fixed charge $+3$, a smaller ionic radius $r$ gives a stronger electric field at the ligand and greater polarization of the O–H bond, stabilizing $[M(H_{2}O)_{n-1}(OH)]^{2+}$ relative to $[M(H_{2}O)_{n}]^{3+}$ and increasing $K_{a}$. The $Fe^{3+}$ ion is significantly smaller than $Gd^{3+}$, so its charge density is higher and its Lewis acidity stronger; this is a principal reason for the lower $pK_{a}$ of $[Fe(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{3+}$.\n\nIn addition, the nature of metal–ligand bonding differs: for $Fe^{3+}$, the 3d orbitals can overlap appreciably with O 2p orbitals, imparting greater covalent character to the Fe–O bond. This increased covalency enhances electron withdrawal from the coordinated water oxygen and further weakens the O–H bond, facilitating deprotonation. In contrast, for $Gd^{3+}$ the 4f orbitals are contracted and core-like, contributing little to bonding; lanthanide–oxygen bonds are largely ionic, leading to weaker polarization of the O–H bond and thus higher $pK_{a}$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly identifies both the higher charge density of $Fe^{3+}$ due to its smaller radius and the greater covalent character arising from 3d participation, both of which increase acidity.\n- B is false because $Fe^{3+}$ and $Gd^{3+}$ have the same formal charge.\n- C is incomplete and misleading: coordination number differences do not dominate the strong acidity difference; size and bonding character are the primary factors.\n- D is incorrect: 4f orbitals are poor at covalent bonding compared to 3d, and the stated effect is opposite to established bonding trends.\n- E is an overgeneralization and does not provide the causal explanation.\n\nTherefore, the most complete and accurate explanation is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2240130"}, {"introduction": "The stability of half-filled electronic subshells, such as $d^5$ and $f^7$, is a recurring theme in inorganic chemistry, yet it does not always translate to redox inertness in solution.
