The 18-electron rule, a useful guideline for the stability of mononuclear complexes, can be extended to predict the number of metal-metal bonds in a cluster. The underlying principle is that the total number of valence electrons required for $n$ metal atoms to each achieve an 18-electron configuration is $18n$. If the cluster's actual Total Valence Electrons (TVE) is less than this value, the deficit is compensated for by the formation of shared, two-electron metal-metal bonds.\n\nConsider the cluster triosmium dodecacarbonyl, which has the chemical formula $Os_3(CO)_{12}$.
