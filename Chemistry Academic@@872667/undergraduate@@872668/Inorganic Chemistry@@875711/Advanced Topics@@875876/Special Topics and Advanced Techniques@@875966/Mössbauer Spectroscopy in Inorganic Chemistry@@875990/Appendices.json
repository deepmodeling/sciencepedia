Both isomers exhibit a near-zero $\\Delta E_Q$. For a high-spin $d^6$ configuration, the valence electron distribution ($t_{2g}^4 e_g^2$) is effectively spherically symmetric, resulting in no significant field gradient regardless of the ligand geometry.", "solution": "The central task is to determine which of the two isomers, *cis*-$[\\text{FeCl}_2\\text{(py)}_4]$ or *trans*-$[\\text{FeCl}_2\\text{(py)}_4]$, will have a larger quadrupole splitting ($\\Delta E_Q$) in its $^{57}$Fe Mössbauer spectrum. The magnitude of $\\Delta E_Q$ is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field gradient (EFG) at the iron nucleus.\n\nThe EFG has two primary sources:\n1.  **Lattice EFG ($q_{lat}$):** An asymmetry in the charge distribution of the surrounding ligands.\n2.  **Valence EFG ($q_{val}$):** An asymmetry in the distribution of the metal's own valence electrons.\n\nThe total EFG is a combination of these two effects. For iron, the valence contribution is often dominant when present.\n\nThe iron center is high-spin Fe(II), which has a $d^6$ electron configuration ($t_{2g}^4 e_g^2$). This configuration has an asymmetrically occupied $t_{2g}$ subshell, which results in a non-zero valence EFG ($q_{val} \\neq 0$) and generally a large quadrupole splitting. The magnitude of this splitting, however, is highly dependent on the precise geometry, as distortions from perfect octahedral symmetry lift the degeneracy of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals and alter the electron distribution.\n\n**Analysis of the *trans* isomer, *trans*-$[\\text{FeCl}_2\\text{(py)}_4]$:**\nIn the *trans* isomer, the two chloride ligands are positioned opposite each other (e.g., along the z-axis), and the four pyridine ligands lie in the equatorial plane (the xy-plane). This geometry has D$_{4h}$ point group symmetry.\nIn D$_{4h}$ symmetry, the axial and equatorial positions are inequivalent, which lifts the degeneracy of the $d$-orbitals further than in $O_h$ symmetry. Specifically, the $t_{2g}$ set splits into a doubly degenerate $e_g$ set ($d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$) and a non-degenerate $b_{2g}$ orbital ($d_{xy}$).\nThe relative energies depend on the $\\pi$-donating/accepting properties of the ligands. Pyridine is a better $\\pi$-acceptor than chloride. The ligands in the xy-plane (py) will stabilize the $d_{xy}$ orbital through $\\pi$-backbonding more effectively than the axial Cl$^-$ ligands stabilize the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals. This typically places the $b_{2g} (d_{xy})$ orbital at a lower energy than the $e_g (d_{xz}, d_{yz})$ set.\nThe four electrons from the $t_{2g}$ set will occupy these orbitals according to the Aufbau principle and Hund's rule. The ground state electronic configuration will be $(b_{2g})^2(e_g)^2$, which corresponds to $(d_{xy})^2(d_{xz})^1(d_{yz})^1$. In this configuration, there is one electron in the $d_{xz}$ orbital and one in the $d_{yz}$ orbital. This pair of electrons creates a charge distribution that is cylindrically symmetric about the z-axis. As a result, this electron arrangement does not generate a significant EFG at the nucleus. Thus, for the *trans* isomer, $q_{val}$ is small.\nThe main contribution to quadrupole splitting comes from the lattice EFG ($q_{lat}$), which arises from the difference in charge and bonding between the two axial Cl$^-$ ligands and the four equatorial py ligands. Experimentally, the $\\Delta E_Q$ for *trans*-$[\\text{FeCl}_2\\text{(py)}_4]$ is quite small, suggesting that the electronic ground state is nearly symmetric.\n\n**Analysis of the *cis* isomer, *cis*-$[\\text{FeCl}_2\\text{(py)}_4]$:**\nIn the *cis* isomer, the two chloride ligands are adjacent to each other (e.g., at the +z and +y positions). This geometry has C$_{2v}$ point group symmetry. This symmetry is much lower than D$_{4h}$.\nIn C$_{2v}$ symmetry, there are no doubly or triply degenerate irreducible representations for the $d$-orbitals. Therefore, the C$_{2v}$ ligand field lifts the degeneracy of all the $d$-orbitals. The $t_{2g}$ set splits into three distinct, non-degenerate orbitals (e.g., $d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$ all have different energies).\nThe four $t_{2g}$ electrons will populate these three non-degenerate orbitals. The ground state configuration will be of the form $(d_1)^2(d_2)^1(d_3)^1$, where $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_3$ are the three orbitals derived from the $t_{2g}$ set. This distribution of electrons is highly asymmetric. It lacks the cylindrical symmetry found in the *trans* case. This profound electronic asymmetry generates a large valence EFG ($q_{val} \\neq 0$).\nSince the valence contribution ($q_{val}$) is generally much larger than the lattice contribution ($q_{lat}$), the *cis* isomer is expected to exhibit a large, non-zero quadrupole splitting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe *cis* isomer has a large $\\Delta E_Q$ due to a significant valence contribution arising from the asymmetric filling of the fully non-degenerate $t_{2g}$-derived orbitals in C$_{2v}$ symmetry. The *trans* isomer has a much smaller $\\Delta E_Q$ because its D$_{4h}$ symmetry maintains a partial degeneracy in the $t_{2g}$ set, leading to a more symmetric electronic ground state with a small valence EFG. Therefore, $\\Delta E_Q(\\text{cis}) \\gg \\Delta E_Q(\\text{trans})$.\n\nReviewing the options:\n- A is incorrect. It predicts *trans* has the larger splitting and incorrectly states that D$_{4h}$ symmetry fully lifts the $t_{2g}$ degeneracy.\n- B is correct. It predicts *cis* has the larger splitting and correctly attributes this to the low C$_{2v}$ symmetry which fully lifts the $t_{2g}$ degeneracy, causing an asymmetric electron population ($q_{val} \\neq 0$).\n- C is incorrect. It fails to distinguish between the electronic consequences of the different symmetries.\n- D is incorrect. It predicts *trans* has the larger splitting based on a flawed additive model for the lattice contribution, ignoring the more dominant valence term.\n- E is incorrect. It wrongly assumes the $d^6$ configuration is effectively symmetric.\n\nThus, the correct statement is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2272782"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply predicting the presence of quadrupole splitting, we can quantitatively describe the nature of the electric field gradient (EFG) that causes it.
