For a cluster with $n$ skeletal vertices, the required number of skeletal electron pairs (SEP) is $n+1$ for closo, $n+2$ for nido, $n+3$ for arachno, and $n+4$ for hypho. For neutral carboranes with two carbon atoms, there is a convenient diagnostic by hydrogen count relative to $n$: the characteristic formulas are closo $C_{2}B_{n-2}H_{n}$, nido $C_{2}B_{n-2}H_{n+2}$, arachno $C_{2}B_{n-2}H_{n+4}$, and hypho $C_{2}B_{n-2}H_{n+6}$. Equivalently, for $n$ total vertices, the hydrogen count $H$ equals $n$, $n+2$, $n+4$, or $n+6$ for closo, nido, arachno, or hypho, respectively.\n\nFor $B_{4}C_{2}H_{8}$, the total number of skeletal vertices is $n=4+2=6$, and the hydrogen count is $H=8$.

Structurally, it consists of a closed cage (a *closo*-cluster) in the shape of an icosahedron, with ten vertices occupied by boron atoms and two adjacent vertices occupied by carbon atoms. Each boron and carbon atom is also bonded to one external hydrogen atom. The room temperature, proton-decoupled $^{11}$B Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum of $1,2-C_2B_{10}H_{12}$ in solution exhibits four distinct resonance signals with a relative intensity ratio of 2:2:4:2.\n\nThis neutral carborane can be chemically reduced by reacting it with two equivalents of a strong reducing agent, such as sodium naphthalenide, to form the dianion, $[1,2-C_2B_{10}H_{12}]^{2-}$. This reduction process induces a significant change in the geometry of the molecular cage.\n\nBased on the principles of cluster electron counting and the fundamentals of NMR spectroscopy, predict the most likely qualitative changes that would be observed in the proton-decoupled $^{11}$B NMR spectrum when comparing the neutral starting material, $1,2-C_2B_{10}H_{12}$, to its dianionic product, $[1,2-C_2B_{10}H_{12}]^{2-}$.\n\nA.

Consistently, the observed proton-decoupled $^{11}$B NMR shows four signals in a $2:2:4:2$ ratio, reflecting the symmetry-inequivalent boron sites in the $n=12$ closo cage containing two adjacent carbon atoms.\n\nUpon two-electron reduction to the dianion $[1,2$-$\\mathrm{C_{2}B_{10}H_{12}}]^{2-}$, the skeletal electron count increases by $2$ electrons:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{skeletal}}^{2-} = 26 + 2 = 28 = 2n + 4 \\quad (n=12).\n$$\nBy Wade–Mingos rules, $2n+4$ corresponds to a nido cluster for the same number of vertices, i.e., an open-cage structure. This transformation from closo to nido lowers the molecular symmetry and increases the number of symmetry-inequivalent boron environments. Therefore, the number of distinct $^{11}$B resonances is expected to increase relative to the four observed for the neutral closo species.\n\nNext, consider the qualitative direction of $^{11}$B chemical shift changes. In NMR, the local field at the nucleus is\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{loc}} = B_{0}(1 - \\sigma),\n$$\nwhere $B_{0}$ is the applied magnetic field and $\\sigma$ is the shielding constant. The resonance frequency is proportional to $B_{\\mathrm{loc}}$, and the chemical shift $\\delta$ decreases (moves upfield to lower ppm) as $\\sigma$ increases. Addition of electrons into skeletal bonding orbitals of the cluster increases electron density at boron and generally increases $\\sigma$ for $^{11}$B, producing upfield shifts. The conversion from neutral closo to electron-richer nido dianion thus leads to significantly more shielded $^{11}$B nuclei, hence appreciable upfield movement of their resonances.\n\nCombining these two effects:\n- Structural change closo $\\rightarrow$ nido lowers symmetry and increases the number of distinct boron sites, so the number of $^{11}$B signals increases.\n- Increased electron density upon reduction increases shielding, so $^{11}$B resonances shift significantly upfield (to lower ppm).\n\nTherefore, the correct qualitative prediction is that the number of signals increases and they shift upfield.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2237460"}]}
