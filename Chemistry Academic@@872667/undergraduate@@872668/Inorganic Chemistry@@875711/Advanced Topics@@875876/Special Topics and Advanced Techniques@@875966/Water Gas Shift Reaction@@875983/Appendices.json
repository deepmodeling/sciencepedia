By analyzing the chemical interactions at the catalyst surface, you will gain insight into the mechanisms of deactivation and the importance of feed stream purification in maintaining process efficiency.", "problem": "The Water-Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, given by the equilibrium CO + H₂O ⇌ CO₂ + H₂, is a crucial industrial process for producing high-purity hydrogen and adjusting the carbon monoxide content of synthesis gas. The high-temperature version of this reaction is typically carried out at 310-450 °C using a robust catalyst consisting of iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃) that is reduced in-situ to magnetite (Fe₃O₄), promoted with chromium(III) oxide (Cr₂O₃). However, the feed gas stream, often derived from coal or biomass gasification, can contain impurities like hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). It is well-documented that even small concentrations of H₂S can lead to significant deactivation of this iron-chromium catalyst.\n\nFrom the choices below, select the most accurate and primary chemical reason for the deactivation of the high-temperature WGS iron-chromium catalyst by hydrogen sulfide.\n\nA. H₂S strongly adsorbs onto the active iron sites and reacts to form a stable, catalytically inert iron sulfide layer, preventing the adsorption of CO and H₂O.\n\nB. H₂S acts as a powerful oxidant, converting the active magnetite (Fe₃O₄) phase back to the less active hematite (Fe₂O₃) phase.\n\nC. H₂S, being an acidic gas, reacts preferentially with the Cr₂O₃ promoter, causing structural collapse of the catalyst and loss of surface area.\n\nD. Elemental sulfur, formed from the decomposition of H₂S at high temperatures, physically deposits on the catalyst surface and blocks the catalyst's pores.\n\nE.

Hydrogen sulfide is a classic sulfiding poison for transition-metal catalysts because sulfur binds strongly to metal centers and converts their surfaces into metal sulfides that are catalytically inert for the target reaction.\n\nOn iron-oxide surfaces, $\\mathrm{H_2S}$ reacts with surface iron sites to form an iron sulfide layer that blocks adsorption.
