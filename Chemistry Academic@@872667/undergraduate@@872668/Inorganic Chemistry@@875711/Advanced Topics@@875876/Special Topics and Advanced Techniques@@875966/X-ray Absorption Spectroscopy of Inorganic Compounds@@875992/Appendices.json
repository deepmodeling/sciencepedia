The X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) region of the spectrum contains the \"absorption edge,\" which corresponds to the energy required to excite a core electron to a vacant orbital. For transition metals, the K-edge corresponds to the excitation of a 1s core electron. The precise energy of this K-edge is highly sensitive to the effective nuclear charge on the absorbing atom.\n\nConsider the two following iron coordination complexes: hexa-aqua-iron(II), $[\\text{Fe}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$, and hexa-cyano-ferrate(II), $[\\text{Fe}(\\text{CN})_6]^{4-}$.

These oscillations arise from the interference of the outgoing photoelectron wave with waves backscattered from neighboring atoms.

This signal is analyzed as a function of the photoelectron wavenumber, $k$.\n\nFor a simplified system involving a central absorbing atom and a single shell of identical neighboring scatterer atoms at a distance $R$, the dominant oscillatory component of the EXAFS signal can be described by a sinusoidal function. The argument of this sine function (its phase) is approximately a linear function of both $k$ and $R$. For the purpose of analyzing the frequency of these oscillations, we can consider the primary term governing the oscillation to be $\\sin(2kR)$.\n\nConsider two different solid-state inorganic compounds, Compound 1 and Compound 2.

The technique used is Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, performed at the Platinum L₃ absorption edge. The EXAFS data, which is a function of the photoelectron wave number $k$, is analyzed by taking its Fourier Transform (FT).\n\nThe magnitude of the FT of an EXAFS spectrum yields a pseudo-radial distribution function, where peaks correspond to shells of atoms surrounding the central absorbing atom (in this case, Platinum). Two key principles govern the interpretation of this FT spectrum:\n1.  **Peak Position**: A peak in the FT appears at an apparent distance, $R$, which is shorter than the true interatomic distance, $r$, due to a phase shift effect. The relationship is approximately $R \\approx r - \\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive phase shift value typically between 0.2 Å and 0.5 Å.\n2.  **Peak Amplitude**: The amplitude (or intensity) of a peak is proportional to the number of atoms in that shell and the backscattering strength of those atoms.
