The color we perceive is not the color of light the compound absorbs, but rather its complement—the light that is transmitted or reflected. This practice builds upon the previous concept by asking you to predict the visual appearance of a complex based on its absorption maximum, reinforcing the essential relationship between the absorbed spectrum and observed color [@problem_id:2297643].", "problem": "A coordination chemist is studying a newly synthesized octahedral complex containing a single titanium(III) ion as the central metal. An aqueous solution of this complex is analyzed using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer.

The problem states that the complex has a maximum absorbance ($\\lambda_{max}$) at 570 nm.\n\nStep 1: Identify the color of the absorbed light.\nThe visible spectrum of light can be approximately categorized by wavelength:\n- Violet: 400–450 nm\n- Blue: 450–495 nm\n- Green: 495–570 nm\n- Yellow: 570–590 nm\n- Orange: 590–620 nm\n- Red: 620–750 nm\n\nA wavelength of 570 nm falls at the border of the green and yellow regions. Therefore, the light being absorbed by the complex is yellow-green.\n\nStep 2: Determine the observed color.\nThe observed color is the light that is transmitted or reflected, which is the complementary color to the absorbed light. A simple color wheel helps in identifying complementary colors:\n- Red is complementary to Green.\n- Orange is complementary to Blue.\n- Yellow is complementary to Violet/Purple.\n\nSince the absorbed color is yellow-green, its complementary color lies between the complements of yellow (violet/purple) and green (red). The combination of red and violet results in a purple or magenta color. Therefore, the complex will appear purple to the human eye.\n\nStep 3: Justify the choice by evaluating the options.\n- A. Blue: This would be observed if the complex absorbed orange light (approx. 590–620 nm).\n- B. Yellow-Green: This is the color of the light *absorbed* by the complex, not the color observed.\n- C. Red: This would be observed if the complex absorbed green light (approx. 495–570 nm). While close, the absorption maximum is distinctly in the yellow-green region, making purple a better answer.\n- D. Purple: This is the complementary color to yellow-green light (570 nm), which is absorbed by the complex. This is the correct answer.\n- E. Colorless: This would imply that the complex does not absorb light in the visible region, which contradicts the given $\\lambda_{max}$ of 570 nm.\n\nUnderlying Principle: The titanium(III) ion has a $d^1$ electron configuration. In an octahedral ligand field, the d-orbitals split into a lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set and a higher-energy $e_g$ set. The single d-electron resides in one of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. The absorption of a photon with energy corresponding to $\\lambda_{max}$ promotes this electron from the $t_{2g}$ level to the $e_g$ level. This single electronic transition ($^2T_{2g} \\rightarrow ^2E_g$) is responsible for the color of the complex. The energy of this transition, $\\Delta_o$, is related to the wavelength by $\\Delta_o = hc/\\lambda_{max}$. The absorption removes specific wavelengths (yellow-green light) from the white light passing through the solution, and the remaining transmitted light is what we perceive as the color of the complex (purple).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2297643"}, {"introduction": "Real UV-Vis spectra often contain multiple absorption bands of vastly different intensities. Understanding these differences requires moving beyond simple energy calculations to consider the quantum mechanical \"selection rules\" that govern transition probabilities. This final practice explores how molecular symmetry and ligand identity influence spectral features, comparing a highly symmetric complex where d-d transitions are formally forbidden with a less symmetric one where these rules are relaxed. It also introduces the concept of intensely colored charge-transfer bands, providing a more complete framework for interpreting complex spectra [@problem_id:2297627].", "problem": "A chemist synthesizes two coordination complexes of cobalt(III). Complex A is hexaamminecobalt(III), $[Co(NH_3)_6]^{3+}$, which adopts a perfectly octahedral ($O_h$) geometry. Complex B is chloropentaamminecobalt(III), $[Co(NH_3)_5Cl]^{2+}$, which has a lower symmetry (approximated as $C_{4v}$). Both are diamagnetic low-spin $d^6$ complexes. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra are recorded for aqueous solutions of both compounds.\n\nThe electronic transitions observed in these spectra can be classified as either d-d transitions within the cobalt ion's d-orbitals or as charge-transfer (CT) transitions between the metal and the ligands. The intensity of an absorption band is quantified by its molar absorptivity, $\\epsilon$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate comparison of the expected features in the UV-Vis spectra of Complex A and Complex B?\n\nA. Complex A will exhibit more intense d-d absorption bands than Complex B because its higher symmetry allows for a larger number of possible electronic transitions.\n\nB. Both complexes will exhibit absorption bands of similar, high intensity ($\\epsilon > 1000$ L mol$^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$) because d-d transitions in Co(III) complexes are always fully allowed.\n\nC. The spectrum of Complex B will be dominated by an intense metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band, whereas the spectrum of Complex A will only show very weak d-d bands.\n\nD. Complex A will show relatively weak d-d transitions. Complex B will show d-d transitions of significantly greater intensity than Complex A, and will also likely feature a very intense ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) band involving the chloride ligand.\n\nE. The spectra of both complexes will be nearly identical, showing only two weak d-d absorption bands, as the substitution of a single ammine ligand with a chloride ligand is too small a perturbation to affect the electronic structure.", "solution": "For a low-spin $d^{6}$ octahedral cobalt(III) complex, the electronic configuration is $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}$ with a singlet ground term. In $O_{h}$ symmetry, Complex A has ground state $^{1}A_{1g}$ and lowest-energy excited states derived from $t_{2g}^{5}e_{g}^{1}$ such as $^{1}T_{1g}$ and $^{1}T_{2g}$. The electric dipole transition moment is $\\mu_{if}\\propto\\langle \\psi_{f}|\\hat{\\mu}|\\psi_{i}\\rangle$. In centrosymmetric environments, the Laporte (parity) selection rule applies: electric dipole transitions require a change in parity ($g\\to u$ or $u\\to g$), while $g\\to g$ and $u\\to u$ are forbidden. Since both initial and final d-states are $g$, the d-d transitions in Complex A are Laporte forbidden, though they can gain weak intensity via vibronic coupling. Consequently, their molar absorptivities satisfy $\\epsilon\\ll 1000$ and are typically small.\n\nIn Complex B, the symmetry is approximated as $C_{4v}$, which lacks an inversion center. Without inversion symmetry, the Laporte rule does not strictly apply; odd-parity character can mix into the d-states, relaxing the parity restriction and enhancing d-d intensities. The spin selection rule $\\Delta S=0$ is still obeyed (singlet to singlet), so d-d transitions in Complex B are expected to be significantly more intense than in Complex A, though still generally weaker than fully allowed charge-transfer bands.\n\nCharge-transfer transitions are typically electric-dipole allowed and thus intense. For Co(III) with a halide ligand, ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) from the halide $p$-orbitals to the metal is favored because Co(III) is a strong electron acceptor and halides are good donors. An LMCT band involving chloride is therefore expected to be intense (with $\\epsilon\\gg 1000$) and can dominate the spectrum of Complex B. By contrast, metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) from Co(III) to ammine is disfavored because NH$_{3}$ lacks low-lying acceptor orbitals, and MLCT to chloride is not meaningful since Cl$^{-}$ is not an acceptor. Complex A, containing only ammine ligands, lacks a low-energy intense CT pathway in the visible; its spectrum is dominated by weak, Laporte-forbidden d-d bands.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: higher symmetry in $O_{h}$ enforces Laporte forbiddance and decreases, rather than increases, d-d intensity.\n- B is incorrect: d-d bands in Co(III) are not fully allowed; $\\epsilon$ is not generally greater than $1000$.\n- C is incorrect: the dominant CT in Complex B is LMCT (ligand to metal), not MLCT.\n- D is correct: Complex A shows weak d-d bands; Complex B shows more intense d-d bands due to loss of inversion symmetry and also a very intense LMCT band from Cl$^{-}$ to Co(III).\n- E is incorrect: the substitution of chloride significantly alters both symmetry (affecting selection rules) and introduces LMCT, so the spectra are not nearly identical.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2297627"}]}
