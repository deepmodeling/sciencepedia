This exercise delves into the 'leveling' and 'differentiating' effects, which are pivotal for selecting appropriate solvents in synthesis and analysis. You will predict how the relative strengths of two strong acids change when they are moved from water to a much more basic solvent, liquid ammonia. [@problem_id:2274695]", "problem": "In acid-base chemistry, the observed strength of an acid is highly dependent on the solvent in which it is dissolved. An acid's strength is defined by its ability to donate a proton to the solvent. A highly basic solvent will readily accept protons from a wide range of acids, causing them to appear similarly strong. This phenomenon is known as the **leveling effect**. In contrast, a less basic (or even acidic) solvent does not readily accept protons, which allows the intrinsic differences between acids to become more apparent. This is known as the **differentiating effect**.\n\nIn aqueous solution, both perchloric acid ($HClO_4$) and hydrochloric acid ($HCl$) are considered strong acids, meaning they are essentially fully ionized. However, in the gas phase, where solvent effects are absent, $HClO_4$ is known to be an intrinsically stronger acid than $HCl$. Now consider using liquid ammonia ($NH_3$), a solvent that is significantly more basic than water ($H_2O$), to dissolve these two acids.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the relative acid strengths of $HClO_4$ and $HCl$ in liquid ammonia?\n\nA. The leveling effect will be more pronounced than in water. The difference in strength between the two acids will be completely indistinguishable, as both will be fully protonating the solvent.\nB. Liquid ammonia will act as a differentiating solvent for these acids. The difference in acid strength between $HClO_4$ and $HCl$ will become much more apparent than it is in water.\nC. The relative acid strengths will be inverted. In liquid ammonia, $HCl$ will act as a stronger acid than $HClO_4$ due to specific solvation interactions.\nD. Both $HClO_4$ and $HCl$ will behave as weak acids in liquid ammonia, with very limited ionization, because the solvent is too basic.\nE. The behavior will be essentially identical to that in water. Both acids will be fully ionized, and the perceived difference in strength will be the same as in an aqueous solution.", "solution": "We analyze acid strength in a given solvent via the proton-transfer equilibrium between the acid and the solvent. For an acid $HX$ in a protic solvent $S$, the fundamental process is\n$$\nHX + S \\rightleftharpoons SH^{+} + X^{-}.\n$$\nThe observed acid strength is governed by the position of this equilibrium. The leveling effect states that in a given solvent $S$, any acid stronger than the conjugate acid $SH^{+}$ will be leveled to the same observed strength, producing $SH^{+}$ quantitatively. The strongest acid that can exist in that solvent is therefore $SH^{+}$.\n\nIn water, $S=H_{2}O$, so the conjugate acid is $H_{3}O^{+}$. Both $HClO_{4}$ and $HCl$ are much stronger than $H_{3}O^{+}$, so they are leveled:\n$$\nHClO_{4} + H_{2}O \\to H_{3}O^{+} + ClO_{4}^{-}, \\quad\nHCl + H_{2}O \\to H_{3}O^{+} + Cl^{-},\n$$\nboth proceeding essentially to completion. Hence their intrinsic difference is not observed in water.\n\nIn liquid ammonia, $S=NH_{3}$, the conjugate acid is $NH_{4}^{+}$, and the solvent autoprotolysis is\n$$\n2\\,NH_{3} \\rightleftharpoons NH_{4}^{+} + NH_{2}^{-}.\n$$\nBecause $NH_{3}$ is significantly more basic than $H_{2}O$, it is an even more effective proton acceptor. Consequently, strong acids are leveled more completely to $NH_{4}^{+}$:\n$$\nHClO_{4} + NH_{3} \\to NH_{4}^{+} + ClO_{4}^{-}, \\quad\nHCl + NH_{3} \\to NH_{4}^{+} + Cl^{-},\n$$\nwith the equilibria lying overwhelmingly to the right. Thus, in liquid ammonia, both $HClO_{4}$ and $HCl$ fully protonate the solvent to give $NH_{4}^{+}$ and behave indistinguishably as acids; their intrinsic difference remains unobserved. Since $NH_{3}$ is more basic than $H_{2}O$, this leveling is, in general, even more pronounced than in water.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that liquid ammonia produces a stronger leveling effect, rendering the difference in acid strengths between $HClO_{4}$ and $HCl$ completely indistinguishable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2274695"}, {"introduction": "A solvent's role extends beyond mediating acid-base reactions; it can fundamentally alter the stability of different oxidation states and thus control redox pathways.
