Consider the creation of a discrete molecular square intended for use as a host for small guest molecules.\n\nThe assembly process involves two components: a metal salt providing Copper(II) ions and a specially designed organic ligand, which we will denote as 'L'. The ligand 'L' is a rigid, linear molecule with two different coordinating sites: one end has a pyridyl group (a neutral nitrogen-atom donor), and the other end has a deprotonated carboxylate group (-COO⁻).\n\nWhen four equivalents of the Cu(II) ions are mixed with four equivalents of the ligand 'L' in a suitable solvent, they spontaneously form a single, stable metallo-macrocycle with the formula $[Cu_4L_4]$. In this assembly, the four Cu(II) ions act as the corners of a square, and the four linear ligands 'L' bridge the metal ions to form the sides of the square.\n\nBased on the charges of the constituent building blocks, what is the overall electric charge of the resulting $[Cu_4L_4]$ supramolecular square?\n\nA) +8\n\nB) +4\n\nC) 0\n\nD) -4\n\nE) -8", "solution": "We determine the overall charge by summing the charges contributed by the metal ions and the ligands, using charge conservation.\n\nEach Cu(II) ion has charge $+2$.

This practice [@problem_id:2291483] reveals that the stoichiometry of a self-assembled cage is not arbitrary but is dictated by powerful constraints, including charge neutrality and the connectivity of the components. By combining these chemical rules with principles of polyhedral geometry, you can deduce the most likely formula for a complex structure, showcasing the predictive power of supramolecular design.", "problem": "In the field of supramolecular chemistry, functional molecular 'cages' can be designed to self-assemble from simple components, with applications ranging from catalysis to drug delivery. Imagine such a system where a discrete, hollow, cage-like structure forms from two types of building blocks in solution.\n\nThe first component is a trivalent metal cation, denoted as $M^{3+}$. The second is a rigid organic ligand, which in its fully deprotonated state is denoted $L^{3-}$. This ligand is described as 'tritopic', meaning it is structured to bind to three separate metal ions simultaneously.\n\nFor the self-assembly to be successful, the final, discrete cage structure must be a closed, convex polyhedron and must be electrically neutral overall. Based on these constraints, determine the simplest possible stoichiometry, in the form $M_xL_y$, for a stable cage formed from these components.", "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of metal ions $M^{3+}$ and $y$ the number of ligands $L^{3-}$ in the discrete cage.\n\nCharge neutrality requires the total charge to vanish:\n$$\n3x - 3y = 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad x = y.\n$$\n\nEach ligand is tritopic, so each $L$ binds to three metals. Let $c_{M}$ be the number of ligands bound to each metal (the metal’s connectivity in the assembly). Let $E$ be the total number of $M$–$L$ coordination bonds (edges). Counting edges from both sides gives\n$$\nE = c_{M} x = 3 y.\n$$\nUsing $x = y$ from charge neutrality, we obtain\n$$\nc_{M} = 3.\n$$\nThus, in the assembled cage, both $M$ and $L$ are three-connected. The underlying connectivity graph is therefore a 3-regular (cubic), bipartite, planar polyhedral graph with vertices partitioned into the $M$ set and the $L$ set.\n\nLet $V$ be the total number of vertices and $F$ the number of faces. Then\n$$\nV = x + y, \\qquad E = \\frac{3V}{2},\n$$\nby the handshaking lemma for 3-regular graphs. Since the graph is bipartite, all cycles (faces) have even length, so each face has at least $4$ edges. Let $f_{k}$ denote the number of $k$-gonal faces; then\n$$\n2E = \\sum_{k \\geq 4} k f_{k} \\geq 4 \\sum_{k \\geq 4} f_{k} = 4F,\n$$\nwhich implies\n$$\nE \\geq 2F.\n$$\nUsing Euler’s formula $V - E + F = 2$ together with $E \\geq 2F$, we get\n$$\n2 = V - E + F \\leq V - E + \\frac{E}{2} = V - \\frac{E}{2} = V - \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{3V}{2} = \\frac{V}{4}.\n$$\nHence\n$$\nV \\geq 8.\n$$\nThe bound is achieved when all faces are quadrilaterals, i.e., for the cube, which is a 3-regular bipartite polyhedron.

This final practice [@problem_id:2291466] explores how we can control this equilibrium. You will analyze the competition between the formation of a discrete macrocycle (an intramolecular process) and linear oligomers (an intermolecular process), discovering how a simple experimental variable—concentration—can be used to guide the assembly towards a desired product, a concept central to the practical synthesis of these molecules.", "problem": "In a non-aqueous solvent, a system is prepared by mixing a metal precursor, M, which has a 90-degree preference for its coordination geometry, with a linear, rigid ditopic ligand, L. After reaching equilibrium, the solution contains a mixture of self-assembled species. The primary products are a discrete, square-shaped macrocycle with the formula $[M_2L_2]$ and a series of linear oligomers with the general formula $[ML]_n$.\n\nThe solution is at equilibrium at an initial total concentration of monomeric units. It is then subjected to a high degree of dilution by adding a large volume of the pure solvent, and the system is allowed to re-establish equilibrium.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the change in the equilibrium distribution of the *assembled* species?\n\nA.

The equilibrium will shift to favor the formation of the discrete $[M_2L_2]$ macrocycle.\n\nC. The dilution will have no effect on the relative proportions of the macrocycle and the oligomers.\n\nD. The equilibrium will shift to favor the formation of short linear oligomers, primarily $[ML]_2$, over all other species.\n\nE. Both the macrocycle and the oligomers will convert into a single, dominant, very long polymer chain to minimize the number of particles in solution.", "solution": "We consider the self-assembly equilibria in terms of the law of mass action and how dilution affects equilibria that differ in molecularity.\n\nFirst, model the linear oligomerization as an isodesmic growth in which an $[ML]$ unit adds to an $[ML]_{n}$ chain end to give $[ML]_{n+1}$:\n$$\n[ML]_{n} + [ML]_{1} \\rightleftharpoons [ML]_{n+1}, \\quad K_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{[ML]_{n+1}}{[ML]_{n}[ML]_{1}}.\n$$\nFrom this,\n$$\n\\frac{[ML]_{n+1}}{[ML]_{n}} = K_{\\text{int}}[ML]_{1}.\n$$\nThus, for fixed $K_{\\text{int}}$, lowering $[ML]_{1}$ by dilution decreases the ratio $[ML]_{n+1}/[ML]_{n}$ for all $n$, shifting the linear distribution toward shorter oligomers (smaller $n$). This is a direct consequence of the law of mass action and Le Ch\\^atelier’s principle: each intermolecular association step reduces the number of particles by one and is disfavored upon dilution.\n\nNext, consider the discrete macrocycle $[M_{2}L_{2}]$. It can be viewed as arising by intramolecular cyclization of the linear dimer $[ML]_{2}$:\n$$\n[ML]_{2} \\rightleftharpoons [M_{2}L_{2}], \\quad K_{\\text{cycl}} = \\frac{[M_{2}L_{2}]}{[ML]_{2}}.\n$$\nCrucially, $K_{\\text{cycl}}$ is an intramolecular equilibrium constant and is independent of the bulk solute concentration; it depends on the effective molarity of the reactive ends within $[ML]_{2}$ but not on total solution dilution.\n\nNow compare the two competing processes available to $[ML]_{2}$:\n- Intramolecular cyclization to $[M_{2}L_{2}]$ with equilibrium constant $K_{\\text{cycl}}$, which does not depend on total concentration.\n- Intermolecular growth to $[ML]_{3}$ with\n$$\nK_{\\text{grow,2}} = \\frac{[ML]_{3}}{[ML]_{2}[ML]_{1}},\n$$\nso that\n$$\n\\frac{[ML]_{3}}{[ML]_{2}} = K_{\\text{grow,2}}[ML]_{1}.\n$$\nUpon dilution, $[ML]_{1}$ decreases, which decreases $[ML]_{3}/[ML]_{2}$, while $[M_{2}L_{2}]/[ML]_{2} = K_{\\text{cycl}}$ is unchanged. Therefore, the ratio\n$$\n\\frac{[M_{2}L_{2}]}{[ML]_{3}} = \\frac{K_{\\text{cycl}}}{K_{\\text{grow,2}}[ML]_{1}}\n$$\nincreases as $[ML]_{1}$ decreases. More generally, for $n \\geq 2$,\n$$\n\\frac{[M_{2}L_{2}]}{[ML]_{n}} \\propto \\frac{1}{([ML]_{1})^{n-2}},\n$$\nso dilution strongly suppresses longer oligomers relative to the macrocycle.\n\nAn alternative mass-action viewpoint compares formation from the free components. For the macrocycle,\n$$\n2M + 2L \\rightleftharpoons [M_{2}L_{2}], \\quad K_{\\text{macro}} = \\frac{[M_{2}L_{2}]}{[M]^{2}[L]^{2}}.\n$$\nFor a linear oligomer $[ML]_{n}$,\n$$\nnM + nL \\rightleftharpoons [ML]_{n}, \\quad K_{n} = \\frac{[ML]_{n}}{[M]^{n}[L]^{n}}.\n$$\nOn dilution, $[M]$ and $[L]$ decrease; since $[ML]_{n} \\propto [M]^{n}[L]^{n}$, higher $n$ species are penalized by higher powers of concentration. Thus, among assembled species, the macrocycle is penalized to the same total order as the linear tetramer ($n=2$) but far less than longer oligomers ($n>2$). Consequently, the fraction of $[M_{2}L_{2}]$ increases relative to the ensemble of linear oligomers as the solution is diluted.\n\nCombining these mass-action results:\n- Longer linear oligomers are disfavored upon dilution (contradicting A).\n- The relative proportion of the macrocycle among assembled species increases because intramolecular cyclization is insensitive to bulk concentration while intermolecular growth is suppressed (supporting B).\n- There is a concentration effect, so C is false.\n- Although shorter oligomers are relatively favored over longer ones, privileging primarily $[ML]_{2}$ over all other assembled species ignores the concurrent increase in macrocycle fraction; the dominant shift is toward macrocycle versus further linear growth (so D is less accurate than B).\n- There is no driving force to form a single long polymer upon dilution (E is false).\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that dilution shifts the equilibrium toward the discrete $[M_{2}L_{2}]$ macrocycle relative to the linear oligomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2291466"}]}
