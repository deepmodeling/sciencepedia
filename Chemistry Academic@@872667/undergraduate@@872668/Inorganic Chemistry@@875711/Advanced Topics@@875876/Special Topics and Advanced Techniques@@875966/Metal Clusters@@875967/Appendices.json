For transition metals, it is standard to assume that each metal atom uses 12 electrons in these non-skeletal roles.

This indicates that the cluster should adopt a *nido* geometry.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the *nido* Geometry for n=4**\nA *nido* structure with $n=4$ vertices is formally derived from the parent *closo* polyhedron with $n+1=5$ vertices, which is a trigonal bipyramid. Removing one vertex from a trigonal bipyramid (either axial or equatorial) results in a \"butterfly\" geometry for the remaining four vertices.\n\n- A tetrahedral geometry is the *closo* structure for $n=4$, which would require $n+1 = 5$ SEPs (corresponding to a TVE of $5 \\times 12 + 2 = 58$ under a different model, or $4 \\times 12 + 10 = 58$ from SEPs, or TVE = $58$ from SE = $58-48=10$, SEPs = 5)\n- A square planar geometry is the *arachno* structure for $n=4$, which would require $n+3 = 7$ SEPs.\n- A linear chain is not a compact polyhedron and is not predicted by these rules.\n\nSince our calculation yields 6 SEPs, corresponding to a *nido* structure, the predicted geometry is a butterfly.
