In carbonic anhydrase, the active site metal is $ \\text{Zn}^{2+}$, which in proteins typically adopts a four-coordinate, approximately tetrahedral geometry. In the well-characterized alpha-class carbonic anhydrases (e.g., human carbonic anhydrase II), the primary coordination sphere consists of three imidazole nitrogens from histidine residues (classically His94, His96, His119) and a solvent ligand. In the resting, hydrated state prior to catalysis, this solvent ligand is a bound water molecule, which is polarized by $ \\text{Zn}^{2+}$; deprotonation of this bound water to form a zinc-bound hydroxide occurs during activation and is essential for nucleophilic attack on $\\text{CO}_{2}$. Thus, the resting hydrated state is best described as three histidines plus one water in a tetrahedral environment.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A describes three histidines and a hydroxide, tetrahedral. This corresponds to the deprotonated, nucleophilic zinc-bound hydroxide form after proton transfer, not the hydrated resting state before catalysis begins.\n- B describes four cysteines, tetrahedral, which is characteristic of zinc finger proteins, not carbonic anhydrase.\n- C proposes square planar geometry for $ \\text{Zn}^{2+}$ with two histidines, one glutamate, and one water; square planar is atypical for $ \\text{Zn}^{2+}$ and the ligand set does not match carbonic anhydrase.\n- D describes three histidines and one water in a tetrahedral geometry, which matches the established resting, hydrated state of carbonic anhydrase.\n- E proposes an octahedral environment with only four specified ligands; this is inconsistent with both the known tetrahedral coordination in carbonic anhydrase and with octahedral six-coordinate requirements.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is three histidine residues and one water molecule in a tetrahedral geometry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2300018"}, {"introduction": "Knowing the structure of a catalytic site allows us to make powerful predictions about its function. This practice challenges you to apply core principles of coordination chemistry, such as Hard-Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) theory, to a hypothetical metal substitution in carboxypeptidase A [@problem_id:2299987]. By reasoning through how changing the metal ion from Zn(II) to Cd(II) affects its ability to act as a Lewis acid, you will sharpen your skills in linking chemical properties to biological activity.", "problem": "Carboxypeptidase A is a metalloenzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the C-terminal peptide bond in polypeptide chains. The active site of the native enzyme contains a single zinc(II) ion, which is essential for its catalytic function. A key step in the proposed mechanism involves the coordination of the substrate's carbonyl oxygen atom to this Zn(II) ion.\n\nImagine a bioinorganic chemist synthesizes a variant of carboxypeptidase A where the native Zn(II) ion is quantitatively replaced with a cadmium(II) ion, Cd(II), without altering the protein structure. Based on the principles of coordination chemistry, predict the most likely effect of this substitution on the enzyme's catalytic activity and select the best explanation for this effect.\n\nA. The activity will be significantly enhanced because Cd(II) is larger than Zn(II), allowing it to bind the peptide substrate more tightly through steric effects.\n\nB. The activity will be significantly enhanced because Cd(II) is a softer Lewis acid, which forms a more stable complex with the hard oxygen donor of the substrate's carbonyl group.\n\nC. The activity will remain essentially unchanged because both Zn(II) and Cd(II) are from the same group in the periodic table and possess a +2 charge, giving them similar Lewis acidities.\n\nD. The activity will be significantly diminished because Cd(II) is a softer Lewis acid than Zn(II) and is therefore less effective at polarizing the substrate's carbonyl group.\n\nE. The activity will be significantly diminished because Cd(II) has a higher atomic mass than Zn(II), which slows down the vibrational modes required for the catalytic cycle.", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the catalytic role of the native metal. In carboxypeptidase A, the Zn(II) ion coordinates to the substrate carbonyl oxygen. This Lewis acid-base interaction polarizes the C=O bond, increasing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon and facilitating nucleophilic attack. The strength of this activation depends on the metal ion’s Lewis acidity and its preference for oxygen donors.\n\nStep 2: Apply HSAB theory. The carbonyl oxygen is a hard base. According to HSAB principles, hard acids prefer hard bases, and soft acids prefer soft bases. Zn(II) is a borderline hard acid with substantial affinity for oxygen donors, while Cd(II) is softer than Zn(II). Therefore, replacing Zn(II) with Cd(II) generally weakens the interaction with the hard oxygen donor, reducing the extent of carbonyl polarization.\n\nStep 3: Consider charge density and polarizing power. For a cation of charge $+2e$, the electrostatic field at a given distance scales as $E \\propto \\frac{q}{r^{2}}$. Because Cd(II) has a larger ionic radius than Zn(II), its charge density and resulting electric field near the binding site are smaller:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{Cd^{2+}}} > r_{\\mathrm{Zn^{2+}}} \\implies E_{\\mathrm{Cd^{2+}}}  E_{\\mathrm{Zn^{2+}}}.$$\nLower field strength at the ligand decreases the polarization of the coordinated carbonyl group and thus diminishes catalytic activation.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options using these principles.\n- Option A is incorrect: a larger ion does not enhance binding through steric effects; increased size reduces charge density and Lewis acidity toward hard donors.\n- Option B is incorrect: Cd(II) being softer does not stabilize binding to a hard oxygen donor; HSAB predicts the opposite.\n- Option C is incorrect: being in the same group and having the same charge does not guarantee similar Lewis acidity or HSAB behavior; differences in softness and size matter.\n- Option D is correct: Cd(II) is softer and has lower charge density, making it less effective at polarizing the carbonyl and thus diminishing catalytic activity.\n- Option E is incorrect: differences in atomic mass are not the controlling factor for this Lewis acid-catalyzed step.\n\nTherefore, the catalytic activity will be significantly diminished upon substitution with Cd(II), for the reason stated in D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2299987"}, {"introduction": "The principles of metal-ion binding can be described not just qualitatively but also with quantitative precision.
