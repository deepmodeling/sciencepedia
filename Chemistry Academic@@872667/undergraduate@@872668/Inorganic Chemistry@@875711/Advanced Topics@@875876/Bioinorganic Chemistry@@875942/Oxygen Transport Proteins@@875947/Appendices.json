It binds a single oxygen molecule non-cooperatively. The fractional saturation ($Y$) of myoglobin with oxygen is a function of the partial pressure of oxygen ($p_{O2}$) and can be described by the following equation, which is a specific case of the Hill equation for a protein with a single binding site:\n$$Y = \\frac{p_{O2}}{p_{O2} + P_{50}}$$\nwhere $P_{50}$ is the partial pressure of oxygen at which myoglobin is 50% saturated.\n\nAssume that for a particular species of seal, the myoglobin in its muscle tissue has a $P_{50}$ value of $2.35$ Torr.

The first three significant figures are 7, 6, and 1.

In its oxygenated form, called oxyhemoglobin, the iron is in the +2 oxidation state (Fe(II)) and is situated in a coordination environment that can be modeled as a nearly perfect octahedron. The binding of the dioxygen molecule ($O_2$) acts as a strong-field ligand, resulting in a large crystal-field splitting energy ($\\Delta_o$) that is greater than the electron spin-pairing energy (P).

This exercise challenges you to apply your knowledge of electronic effects and metal-ligand bonding to a novel oxygen-transport protein. By analyzing how a specific chemical modification on the porphyrin ring influences the iron center, you will predict its effect on oxygen affinity, reinforcing the critical link between molecular structure and biological function. [@problem_id:2277043]", "problem": "A team of bioinorganic chemists is studying a novel oxygen-transport protein, named ventoglobin, isolated from a deep-sea worm living near hydrothermal vents. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that ventoglobin contains a heme-like prosthetic group, but with a specific modification compared to the protoporphyrin IX found in human hemoglobin. In ventoglobin's porphyrin, one of the two vinyl groups ($-CH=CH_2$) is replaced by a formyl group ($-CHO$). All other aspects of the protein's primary and tertiary structure around the heme pocket are assumed to be identical to that of a single subunit of human hemoglobin.\n\nThe affinity of an oxygen-transport protein for dioxygen ($O_2$) is commonly quantified by the $P_{50}$ value, which is the partial pressure of $O_2$ at which half of the binding sites are occupied. A lower $P_{50}$ value indicates a higher affinity. Based on the principles of electronic structure and bonding in coordination complexes, predict how the $P_{50}$ value of ventoglobin would compare to that of human hemoglobin.\n\nSelect the most accurate statement from the choices below.\n\nA. Ventoglobin will exhibit a higher $P_{50}$ than hemoglobin. The electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl group reduces the electron density on the iron center, which in turn diminishes the extent of pi-backbonding from the iron d-orbitals to the $O_2$ $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals, thereby weakening the Fe-$O_2$ bond.\n\nB. Ventoglobin will exhibit a lower $P_{50}$ than hemoglobin. The formyl group's electronegative oxygen atom polarizes the heme pocket, enhancing the binding of the slightly polar $O_2$ molecule through favorable electrostatic interactions.\n\nC. Ventoglobin will exhibit a higher $P_{50}$ than hemoglobin. The formyl group is sterically more demanding than the vinyl group, and its presence hinders the approach of the $O_2$ molecule to the iron binding site.\n\nD. Ventoglobin will exhibit a lower $P_{50}$ than hemoglobin. The electron-withdrawing formyl group makes the iron center more electrophilic, which increases its intrinsic Lewis acidity and strengthens its coordination to the electron-donating $O_2$ ligand.\n\nE. The $P_{50}$ values of ventoglobin and hemoglobin will be nearly identical. The substitution occurs on the periphery of the porphyrin macrocycle, and its electronic influence is too attenuated to significantly affect the properties of the central iron atom.", "solution": "We consider dioxygen binding to the heme iron as a simple equilibrium:\n$$\\mathrm{Fe} + O_{2} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Fe}{-}O_{2}.$$\nDefine the equilibrium constant in concentration form as $K = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Fe}{-}O_{2}]}{[\\mathrm{Fe}][O_{2}]}$. For gas-phase dioxygen at partial pressure $p_{O_{2}}$, the site occupancy for a single, independent binding site is\n$$\\theta = \\frac{K' p_{O_{2}}}{1 + K' p_{O_{2}}},$$\nwhere $K'$ is the equilibrium constant expressed in pressure units (proportional to $K$ via the solubility relation). By definition, $P_{50}$ is the $p_{O_{2}}$ at which $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$, hence\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{K' P_{50}}{1 + K' P_{50}} \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad K' P_{50} = 1 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad P_{50} = \\frac{1}{K'}.$$\nThus, a stronger Fe–$O_{2}$ interaction (larger $K'$) corresponds to a lower $P_{50}$, and a weaker interaction (smaller $K'$) corresponds to a higher $P_{50}$. Thermodynamically, $K' = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{RT}\\right)$, so anything that makes $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ less negative decreases $K'$ and increases $P_{50}$.\n\nThe Fe–$O_{2}$ bond in heme proteins is well described by the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model: it involves $\\sigma$ donation from $O_{2}$ into an empty metal orbital and $\\pi$ backbonding from filled Fe $d$ orbitals into the $O_{2}$ $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals, yielding significant Fe(III)–$O_{2}^{-}$ character. The strength of this interaction is very sensitive to the electron density at the iron center: greater $d$-electron availability enhances $\\pi$ backbonding into $O_{2}$ $\\pi^{*}$, stabilizing the bound superoxo-like form and increasing affinity; reduced $d$-electron availability diminishes backbonding and weakens binding.\n\nReplacing a vinyl group by a formyl group on the porphyrin is a classic electron-withdrawing modification (both inductive and resonance effects) that lowers electron density across the conjugated macrocycle and at the coordinated Fe center. This decreases the metal’s capacity for $\\pi$ backbonding into $O_{2}$ $\\pi^{*}$, weakening the Fe–$O_{2}$ bond. Consequently, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ for binding becomes less favorable, $K'$ decreases, and $P_{50}$ increases relative to unmodified heme.\n\nAlternative rationales in the options are less accurate: invoking distal electrostatic polarization from a peripheral formyl group (B) is negligible compared to the dominant electronic effect transmitted through the macrocycle; steric hindrance (C) is unlikely because the substituent lies at the porphyrin periphery and formyl is not more encumbering toward the axial site than vinyl; and arguing that greater Lewis acidity alone strengthens binding (D) ignores that $O_{2}$ binding in hemes relies critically on metal-to-ligand $\\pi$ backbonding, which is reduced by electron withdrawal. The notion that the effect is negligible (E) is contradicted by well-established changes in heme electronic properties and ligand affinities upon such substituent modifications.\n\nTherefore, ventoglobin should exhibit a higher $P_{50}$ than hemoglobin due to reduced $\\pi$ backbonding arising from the electron-withdrawing formyl group, matching statement A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2277043"}]}
