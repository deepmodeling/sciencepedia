These proteins are named Plastocyanin-A and Plastocyanin-B. Chemical analysis reveals that Plastocyanin-A contains a copper(I) center, while Plastocyanin-B contains a copper(II) center.

Upon ionization, electrons are removed from the $4s$ orbital before the $3d$ orbitals in transition metals.\n\n- For Cu(I): removing one electron from $4s$ gives $3d^{10}$.

Many enzymes use metal ions as Lewis acids to catalyze reactions, a role highly dependent on the ion's charge density. This problem explores a case of enzyme inhibition by a toxic metal, asking you to use periodic trends and the principles of Lewis acidity to explain why substituting zinc with cadmium deactivates a hydrolase enzyme. [@problem_id:2271306]", "problem": "A newly discovered bacterial enzyme, \"Aqua-activase,\" is a metalloenzyme crucial for breaking down a specific environmental pollutant. Biochemical analysis reveals that it is a zinc-dependent hydrolase. The active site features a single Zn(II) ion coordinated by three amino acid residues and a water molecule. The catalytic mechanism hinges on the ability of the Zn(II) ion to function as a Lewis acid, polarizing the coordinated water molecule to lower its pKa, thereby generating a potent hydroxide nucleophile at physiological pH. When the growth medium is contaminated with cadmium, the bacteria can inadvertently incorporate Cd(II) ions into the Aqua-activase active site in place of Zn(II), rendering the enzyme completely inactive.\n\nBased on the fundamental chemical properties of these ions, which of the following statements provides the most significant and direct chemical reason for the loss of enzyme activity upon substitution of Zn(II) with Cd(II)?\n\nA. Cd(II) has a lower charge density and is a weaker Lewis acid than Zn(II), making it less effective at polarizing the coordinated water molecule and lowering its pKa.\n\nB. Unlike Zn(II), which is redox-inactive, Cd(II) is easily reduced to Cd(0) under physiological conditions, which disrupts the electronic structure of the active site.\n\nC. The ionic radius of Cd(II) is smaller than that of Zn(II), causing steric strain and a distortion of the active site geometry that prevents substrate binding.\n\nD. According to Hard-Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) theory, the soft acid Cd(II) forms an excessively strong, covalent bond with the hard oxygen donor of the water molecule, preventing the catalytic cycle from proceeding.\n\nE. The $d^{10}$ electron configuration of Zn(II) is critical for catalysis, whereas the partially filled d-orbitals of Cd(II) engage in unfavorable ligand-field interactions.", "solution": "The problem asks for the primary chemical reason why substituting Zn(II) with Cd(II) deactivates the \"Aqua-activase\" enzyme. The key function of the metal ion is explicitly stated: to act as a Lewis acid to polarize a water molecule and lower its pKa.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the properties of the two ions, Zn(II) and Cd(II). Both are in Group 12 of the periodic table.\n- **Electron Configuration**: Zinc is in Period 4, and its ion Zn(II) has the electron configuration $[\\mathrm{Ar}]\\,3d^{10}$. Cadmium is in Period 5, and its ion Cd(II) has the electron configuration $[\\mathrm{Kr}]\\,4d^{10}$. Both are $d^{10}$ ions. This means they have a filled d-shell, lack ligand-field stabilization energy, and are generally considered redox-inactive under biological conditions as their +2 oxidation state is very stable.\n- **Ionic Radius**: As we move down a group, the ionic radius increases. Therefore, the ionic radius of Cd(II) is significantly larger than that of Zn(II).\n- **Lewis Acidity and Charge Density**: Lewis acidity, the ability to accept an electron pair, is related to the ion's charge density (charge-to-radius ratio). Both ions have a +2 charge. Since Cd(II) has a larger radius, it has a lower charge density than Zn(II). An ion with a higher charge density is a more effective electrophile and a stronger Lewis acid because it can more strongly attract electron density from a ligand (like the oxygen in a water molecule). Consequently, Zn(II) is a stronger Lewis acid than Cd(II).\n\nNow, let's relate this to the enzyme's mechanism. The enzyme's function depends on the metal ion polarizing the O-H bonds of a coordinated water molecule. This withdrawal of electron density makes the protons on the water molecule more acidic, lowering its pKa from ~14 in bulk solution to a value near physiological pH (~7). This allows the water to be easily deprotonated to form a hydroxide ion (OH⁻), a powerful nucleophile required for the hydrolysis reaction.\n\nThe effectiveness of this process is directly proportional to the Lewis acidity of the metal ion. The stronger Lewis acid, Zn(II), is very effective at polarizing the water molecule. The weaker Lewis acid, Cd(II), is much less effective. When Cd(II) is in the active site, it does not polarize the coordinated water molecule sufficiently to lower its pKa to the required level. As a result, the hydroxide nucleophile is not generated at physiological pH, and the catalytic hydrolysis step cannot occur. This is the direct chemical reason for the loss of activity.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\n- **A**: This statement correctly identifies that Cd(II) has a lower charge density and is a weaker Lewis acid than Zn(II). It directly links this property to the ion's reduced ability to polarize the water molecule and lower its pKa, which is the core of the catalytic mechanism described. This is the correct explanation.\n\n- **B**: This is incorrect. Both Zn(II) and Cd(II) are $d^{10}$ ions and are not readily reduced or oxidized under physiological conditions. They are considered redox-inactive in a biological context.\n\n- **C**: This statement incorrectly claims that Cd(II) is smaller than Zn(II). In reality, Cd(II) is larger. While the larger size of Cd(II) would indeed cause a distortion of the active site, option A provides a more direct and fundamental reason related to the specific chemical step (water activation) that is failing.\n\n- **D**: This statement misapplies HSAB theory. Zn(II) is considered a borderline acid, while Cd(II) is a soft acid. Water (an oxygen donor) and the nitrogen donors from histidine residues are hard or borderline bases. The interaction between a soft acid (Cd(II)) and a hard base (water's oxygen) is generally *weaker* and less favorable than the interaction between a borderline acid (Zn(II)) and a hard/borderline base. The premise that an \"excessively strong\" bond forms is incorrect.\n\n- **E**: This is incorrect. Both Zn(II) and Cd(II) have a $d^{10}$ electron configuration (a filled d-shell), not partially filled d-orbitals for Cd(II).\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and primary reason for the deactivation is the reduced Lewis acidity of Cd(II) compared to Zn(II).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2271306"}, {"introduction": "Many metalloproteins, particularly those involved in respiration and photosynthesis, function by shuttling electrons.
