The effective charge is calculated as (charge of species $M$) - (charge of site $S$).

This process, known as aliovalent doping, is a cornerstone of materials engineering. This practice demonstrates how the essential principle of charge neutrality governs the type of defects created when a host crystal is doped with ions of a different valence (charge state). By working through this scenario, you will learn to predict how a specific dopant can be used to generate the mobile charge carriers needed for high ionic conductivity. [@problem_id:2262735]", "problem": "To enhance the ionic conductivity of solid Barium Fluoride ($BaF_2$), which is a fluoride ion conductor, it is desirable to increase the concentration of fluoride ion vacancies. This process, known as doping, involves introducing a small amount of a different compound, the dopant, into the host crystal lattice. Consider two potential dopants for $BaF_2$: Lanthanum Fluoride ($LaF_3$) and Potassium Chloride ($KCl$).\n\nThe crystal structure of $BaF_2$ consists of a lattice of $Ba^{2+}$ and $F^-$ ions. When doping, it can be assumed that the dopant cations substitute for the host $Ba^{2+}$ cations, and any dopant anions substitute for the host $F^-$ anions. To maintain the stability of the crystal, the overall charge neutrality must be preserved.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the appropriate dopant to increase the fluoride vacancy concentration and provides the correct primary reasoning based on charge compensation?\n\nA. $LaF_3$ should be used, because the substitution of a trivalent $La^{3+}$ ion for a divalent $Ba^{2+}$ ion creates a local charge surplus, which is compensated by the formation of a fluoride ion vacancy.\n\nB. $KCl$ should be used, because the substitution of a monovalent $K^+$ ion for a divalent $Ba^{2+}$ ion creates a local charge deficit, which is compensated by the formation of a fluoride ion vacancy.\n\nC. $LaF_3$ should be used, because the anion of the dopant ($F^-$) is the same as the host, ensuring minimal disruption and allowing for vacancy creation on the cation sublattice, which in turn promotes fluoride vacancy formation.\n\nD. $KCl$ should be used, because the substitution of a $Cl^-$ ion for a $F^-$ ion creates strain in the lattice, which is relieved by ejecting a neighboring fluoride ion, thus creating a vacancy.\n\nE. Either dopant is equally effective, as the introduction of any foreign ions into a crystal lattice inherently increases the concentration of all types of point defects, including vacancies.", "solution": "We seek to increase the concentration of fluoride ion vacancies in $BaF_{2}$. Let the host cations be $Ba^{2+}$ on cation sites and anions $F^{-}$ on anion sites. A substitutional dopant on the cation sublattice that decreases the net positive charge on that site creates a negatively charged effective defect, which must be compensated by positively charged defects, notably anion (fluoride) vacancies. Conversely, a substitutional dopant on the cation sublattice that increases the net positive charge creates a positively charged effective defect, which must be compensated by negatively charged defects (e.g., anion interstitials or cation vacancies), not by anion vacancies.\n\nWrite the charge-compensation logic explicitly.\n\n1) Doping with $LaF_{3}$:\n- Substitution: $La^{3+}$ on a $Ba^{2+}$ site creates a $+1$ effective charge on the cation sublattice. In Kröger–Vink notation, this is $La_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{\\bullet}$.\n- A fluoride vacancy $V_{\\mathrm{F}}^{\\bullet}$ carries a positive effective charge. Therefore, using $V_{\\mathrm{F}}^{\\bullet}$ to compensate $La_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{\\bullet}$ would not satisfy charge neutrality because both are positively charged.\n- Charge neutrality is instead maintained by creating negatively charged defects, e.g., fluoride interstitials $F_{i}^{'}$ (effective charge $-1$) or cation vacancies $V_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{''}$ (effective charge $-2$). A representative incorporation reaction that preserves neutrality is:\n$$\nLaF_{3} \\rightarrow La_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{\\bullet} + 2F_{\\mathrm{F}}^{x} + F_{i}^{'} \\, ,\n$$\nwhich shows no creation of fluoride vacancies. Thus, $LaF_{3}$ does not increase fluoride vacancy concentration; instead it tends to generate $F^{-}$ interstitials or other negatively charged defects.\n\n2) Doping with $KCl$:\n- Substitution: $K^{+}$ on a $Ba^{2+}$ site creates a $-1$ effective charge on the cation sublattice. In Kröger–Vink notation, this is $K_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{'}$.\n- The anion $Cl^{-}$ substituting on an $F^{-}$ site is isovalent and thus neutral: $Cl_{\\mathrm{F}}^{x}$.\n- To preserve electroneutrality, the $-1$ effective charge of $K_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{'}$ is compensated by creating a positively charged defect. The relevant positively charged defect that promotes fluoride ion conduction is the fluoride vacancy $V_{\\mathrm{F}}^{\\bullet}$. A representative incorporation reaction is:\n$$\nKCl \\rightarrow K_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{'} + Cl_{\\mathrm{F}}^{x} + V_{\\mathrm{F}}^{\\bullet} \\, .\n$$\n- Charge neutrality then reads\n$$\n(-1)\\,n_{K_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{'}} + (+1)\\,n_{V_{\\mathrm{F}}^{\\bullet}} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n_{V_{\\mathrm{F}}^{\\bullet}} = n_{K_{\\mathrm{Ba}}^{'}} \\, ,\n$$\nshowing that each $K^{+}$ substitution creates one fluoride vacancy.\n\nConclusion:\n- $LaF_{3}$ introduces a trivalent cation on a divalent site, which requires negatively charged compensating defects (e.g., $F^{-}$ interstitials), not fluoride vacancies, so it does not increase the fluoride vacancy concentration.\n- $KCl$ introduces a monovalent cation on a divalent site, which is compensated by creating positively charged fluoride vacancies, thereby increasing their concentration.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the option that identifies $KCl$ as the appropriate dopant and justifies it via charge-compensation by fluoride vacancies.\n\nThis matches statement B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2262735"}, {"introduction": "After creating defects to enhance conductivity, the next step is to quantify the material's performance.
