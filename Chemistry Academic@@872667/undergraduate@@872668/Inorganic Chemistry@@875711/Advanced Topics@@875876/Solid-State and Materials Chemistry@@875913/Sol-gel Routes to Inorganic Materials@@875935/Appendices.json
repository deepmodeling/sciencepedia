A common precursor for producing pure silica ($SiO_2$) glass is tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), with the chemical formula $Si(OC_2H_5)_4$. When TEOS undergoes complete hydrolysis and condensation, it reacts with water to form solid silica and ethanol ($C_2H_5OH$) as a byproduct.

The rates of hydrolysis and condensation reactions in the sol-gel process are highly dependent on the molecular structure of the precursor. In this exercise, you will compare the hydrolysis rates of two closely related precursors, TMOS and TEOS, by applying principles of chemical kinetics ([@problem_id:2288385]). This thought experiment illuminates how subtle changes in steric hindrance and electronic effects at the molecular level have a profound impact on reaction dynamics.", "problem": "The sol-gel process is a versatile method for synthesizing inorganic materials, often starting from metal alkoxide precursors. A crucial initial step in this process is hydrolysis, where water molecules react with the precursor. Consider two common silicon-based precursors: tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), with the chemical formula $Si(OCH_3)_4$, and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), with the chemical formula $Si(OCH_2CH_3)_4$. The hydrolysis reaction involves a nucleophilic attack by a water molecule on the central silicon atom.\n\nBased on the principles of chemical kinetics and reaction mechanisms, which of the following statements correctly compares the initial rates of hydrolysis for TMOS and TEOS under identical conditions (concentration, temperature, and pH), and provides the most accurate justification?\n\nA. TEOS hydrolyzes faster than TMOS because the larger ethoxy groups are better leaving groups than methoxy groups.\n\nB. The hydrolysis rates are virtually identical because the Si-O bond being cleaved has the same strength in both molecules.\n\nC. TMOS hydrolyzes faster than TEOS because the smaller methoxy groups provide less steric hindrance, allowing for easier nucleophilic attack on the silicon center.\n\nD. TEOS hydrolyzes faster than TMOS because the ethyl groups are more electron-donating than methyl groups, which increases the reactivity of the silicon atom.", "solution": "We compare initial hydrolysis rates of $\\mathrm{Si(OR)_{4}}$ with $R=\\mathrm{CH_{3}}$ (TMOS) versus $R=\\mathrm{CH_{2}CH_{3}}$ (TEOS) under identical concentration, temperature, and pH. The hydrolysis proceeds by nucleophilic attack of water on silicon to give a pentacoordinate transition state/intermediate, followed by Si–OR bond cleavage. For an associative, nucleophile-attack rate-determining step, the rate constant follows the Eyring expression\n$$\nk=\\kappa \\frac{k_{B}T}{h}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\nso under identical $T$ and solvent, the relative rates are determined by the difference in $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ arising from substituent effects.\n\nSteric effect: The transition state is pentacoordinate at silicon, so crowding around the silicon center increases the activation free energy. Ethoxy groups are larger than methoxy groups, so TEOS experiences greater steric hindrance to nucleophilic approach than TMOS. Thus\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{TEOS}}>\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{TMOS}}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad k_{\\mathrm{TEOS}}<k_{\\mathrm{TMOS}}.\n$$\n\nElectronic effect: Alkoxy substituents donate electron density by an inductive effect; the ethoxy group donates more than the methoxy group. Increased electron donation to silicon decreases its electrophilicity, diminishing the driving force for nucleophilic attack and increasing $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$.

Leaving-group ability correlates inversely with basicity; since the conjugate acid $\\mathrm{ROH}$ of methoxide is slightly more acidic than that of ethoxide, $\\mathrm{CH_{3}O^{-}}$ is not a better leaving group than $\\mathrm{C_{2}H_{5}O^{-}}$, and in any case the rate-determining step is the nucleophilic attack rather than departure. Under acid catalysis, the departing group is protonated $\\mathrm{ROH}$, and differences are small; steric and inductive effects still dominate. Therefore, statement A is incorrect. Statement B is incorrect because rate is governed by the activation barrier, not merely by the ground-state Si–O bond strength. Statement D is incorrect because stronger electron donation by ethyl decreases, not increases, the electrophilicity and reactivity of silicon toward nucleophiles.\n\nConsequently, TMOS hydrolyzes faster than TEOS, primarily due to reduced steric hindrance (with reinforcing electronic effects), which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2288385"}, {"introduction": "The true power of the sol-gel method lies in its ability to create a vast range of materials, from viscous liquids to rigid solids, simply by choosing the right molecular building blocks.
