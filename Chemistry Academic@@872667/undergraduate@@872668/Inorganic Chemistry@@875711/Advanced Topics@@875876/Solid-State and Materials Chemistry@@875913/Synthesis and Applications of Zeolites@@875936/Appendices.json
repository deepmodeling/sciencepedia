In this framework, silicon and aluminum atoms are considered to have oxidation states of +4 and +3, respectively, while oxygen has an oxidation state of -2. The substitution of a silicon atom by an aluminum atom in the neutral silicate framework creates a net negative charge. To maintain overall charge neutrality, this negative framework charge is balanced by exchangeable cations, such as sodium ions ($Na^+$), which reside in the pores and channels of the zeolite.\n\nA particular synthetic zeolite, known as Faujasite, is prepared in the lab. Through chemical analysis, the composition of its crystallographic unit cell is determined to be $Na_x[Al_{12}Si_{36}O_{96}]$. Calculate the value of $x$, which represents the number of sodium ions per unit cell required to ensure the overall compound is electrically neutral.", "solution": "We require overall electrical neutrality of the unit cell.
