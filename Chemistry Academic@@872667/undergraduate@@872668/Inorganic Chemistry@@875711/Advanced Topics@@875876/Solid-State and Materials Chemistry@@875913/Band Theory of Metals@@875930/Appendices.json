This first practice provides a foundational model by exploring the electronic structure of a simple one-dimensional chain of lithium atoms. By applying the principles of band theory, you will determine how the filling of the energy band derived from the valence $s$-orbitals dictates the material's ability to conduct electricity, illustrating the crucial concept of a partially filled band [@problem_id:2234603].", "problem": "A hypothetical one-dimensional crystal is constructed from a long chain of $N$ lithium (Li) atoms, where $N$ is a very large even number. In this model, we consider the formation of an energy band from the interaction of the valence 2s atomic orbitals of all the lithium atoms. This interaction creates a '2s band' containing $N$ distinct molecular orbitals with very closely spaced energy levels. Each neutral lithium atom has the electron configuration [He] 2s$^1$.\n\nAssuming the system is at a temperature of absolute zero (0 K), and considering only the electronic states arising from the 2s orbitals, which of the following statements correctly describes why this 1D lithium chain is predicted to be an electrical conductor?\n\nA. The 2s band is completely filled with electrons, but the small size of the lithium atom allows for quantum tunneling between atoms, resulting in conduction.\n\nB. The 2s band contains twice as many available electronic states as there are valence electrons, leaving it exactly half-filled. This allows electrons to be easily excited to adjacent empty energy levels within the band, enabling conduction.\n\nC. Each of the $N$ molecular orbitals in the 2s band is occupied by one electron. Since there are no empty orbitals, the material is an insulator.\n\nD. The $N$ valence electrons completely fill the lower half of the 2s band, creating a significant energy gap between the highest occupied level and the lowest unoccupied level within the band, which characterizes a semiconductor.\n\nE. The 2s band is completely filled. Conduction is only possible because this filled 2s band energetically overlaps with the empty 2p band.", "solution": "We model the 1D lithium chain using band theory. Each of the $N$ lithium atoms contributes one $2s$ atomic orbital, and their interaction forms $N$ Bloch-like molecular orbitals that make up the $2s$ band. By the Pauli exclusion principle, each molecular orbital can accommodate two electrons of opposite spin, so the total number of available one-electron states in the $2s$ band is\n$$\nN_{\\text{states}}=2N.\n$$\nEach neutral lithium atom contributes one valence electron from the $2s$ orbital, so the total number of electrons to fill this band is\n$$\nN_{e}=N.\n$$\nAt absolute zero, electrons fill the lowest available energy states up to the Fermi energy.

Under an applied electric field, electrons near the Fermi wavevector can be accelerated into these nearby empty states without needing to overcome an energy gap. Therefore, the system conducts at $T=0$ because the $2s$ band is partially filled.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the $2s$ band is not completely filled; conduction arises from partial filling, not tunneling across a filled band.\n- B is correct because the $2s$ band contains $2N$ states while there are $N$ electrons, making it exactly half-filled, allowing low-energy intra-band excitations and conduction.\n- C is incorrect because although there is on average one electron per molecular orbital, each orbital has spin degeneracy, so there remain empty spin states within the same band; the band is not fully occupied.\n- D is incorrect because a half-filled band does not exhibit a gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied levels; the Fermi level lies within the band.\n- E is incorrect under the stated assumption that we are considering only the $2s$-derived electronic states; conduction does not rely on overlap with the $2p$ band here.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2234603"}, {"introduction": "While the concept of partially filled bands elegantly explains conductivity in many metals, it can sometimes lead to incorrect predictions if applied too simplistically. This exercise challenges you to resolve such a paradox with the case of solid beryllium, whose $2s^2$ electron configuration suggests a filled valence band and thus insulating behavior. You will discover that the reality of band structure in three-dimensional solids is more complex, often involving the critical phenomenon of band overlap, which explains why beryllium and other alkaline earth metals are, in fact, conductors [@problem_id:2234649].", "problem": "In the band theory of solids, atomic orbitals of individual atoms in a crystal lattice combine to form continuous energy bands. An s-orbital from each of the $N$ atoms in a crystal forms an s-band containing $N$ molecular orbitals, which can hold a total of $2N$ electrons. Similarly, three p-orbitals from each atom form a p-band that can hold $6N$ electrons. A material is typically an electrical conductor (a metal) if its highest-energy occupied band is only partially filled. If it is completely filled and there is a significant energy gap to the next available empty band, the material is an insulator.\n\nConsider a crystal of solid beryllium (Be), which has the atomic electron configuration [He] $2s^2$. Based on a simple model considering only the filling of the 2s band, one might make an incorrect prediction about its electrical properties. In reality, beryllium is a metal.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct reasoning for why solid beryllium is a metal?\n\nA. The energy of the filled 2s band is sufficiently high, and the energy of the empty 2p band is sufficiently low, that they overlap. This overlap creates a single, continuous, partially-filled band of electronic states, allowing for electron conduction.\n\nB. Beryllium is a semiconductor at absolute zero temperature, but at room temperature, thermal energy is sufficient to promote a significant number of electrons from the filled 2s band across a small energy gap to the empty 2p band, enabling conduction.\n\nC. The high pressure within the solid crystal lattice forces the two electrons in each 2s orbital to un-pair, leaving the 2s band only half-full and thus conductive.\n\nD. Before forming bands, the 2s and 2p orbitals of each beryllium atom hybridize to form sp hybrid orbitals. The resulting sp-band is only half-full, leading to metallic behavior.\n\nE. Pure beryllium is an insulator, but its observed metallic properties are due to the unavoidable presence of impurities and crystal defects that introduce states within the band gap.", "solution": "We consider band formation in a crystal with $N$ atoms. An $s$-orbital from each atom produces an $s$-band with $N$ molecular orbitals that can hold $2N$ electrons (two spins per orbital). A $p$-band formed from three $p$-orbitals per atom contains $3N$ molecular orbitals and can hold $6N$ electrons. For beryllium, each atom supplies two valence electrons from the $2s^{2}$ configuration, so across the crystal there are $2N$ electrons to place in the $2s$-derived band. In a naive picture with a large energy gap between $2s$ and $2p$, the $2s$ band would be completely filled and the $2p$ band empty, implying insulating behavior if there is a significant gap to the next empty band.\n\nIn real solids, Bloch bands acquire finite bandwidths determined by orbital overlaps and the periodic potential. For light elements like Be, the atomic $2s$ and $2p$ levels are close in energy, and the resulting $2s$ and $2p$ bands broaden sufficiently that their energy ranges overlap. When the top of the $2s$ band overlaps the bottom of the $2p$ band, electrons occupy states across the overlapping region up to the Fermi energy, leaving partially filled states at the Fermi level. A partially filled band at zero temperature permits mobile carriers and thus metallic conduction.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A states that the filled $2s$ band and empty $2p$ band overlap in energy, producing a continuous, partially filled band that enables conduction. This correctly captures the $s$-$p$ band overlap in Be.\n- B claims thermally activated promotion across a small gap; this would imply semiconducting behavior at zero temperature, which contradicts Be being metallic at zero temperature.\n- C invokes unpairing due to pressure; spin pairing does not determine band filling in this way, and pressure does not force half-filling of the $2s$ band.\n- D invokes pre-band sp hybridization leading to a half-filled band; while $s$-$p$ mixing can occur in bands, the key is band overlap rather than a half-filled hybrid band prior to band formation.\n- E attributes metallicity to impurities; pure Be is intrinsically metallic due to intrinsic band structure, not impurity states.\n\nTherefore, the correct reasoning is the overlap of the $2s$ and $2p$ bands leading to a partially filled band.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2234649"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the simple classification of materials, the detailed shape of an energy band holds rich information about how charge carriers behave.
