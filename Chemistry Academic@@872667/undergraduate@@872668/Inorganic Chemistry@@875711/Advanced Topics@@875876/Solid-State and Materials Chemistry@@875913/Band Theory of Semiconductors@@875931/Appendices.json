The electronic properties of these materials are largely determined by their band gap energy ($E_g$), which is the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. In this series of compounds, the valence band is primarily formed from the atomic p-orbitals of the chalcogen anion (X$^{2-}$), while the conduction band is predominantly formed from the 5s atomic orbitals of the cadmium cation (Cd$^{2+}$).\n\nBased on periodic trends and their effect on atomic orbital energies, determine the correct arrangement of the compounds Cadmium Sulfide (CdS), Cadmium Selenide (CdSe), and Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) in order of decreasing band gap energy.\n\nA.

All three compounds have approximately the same band gap energy.", "solution": "Let the band gap be defined as the energy difference between the conduction-band minimum and the valence-band maximum:\n$$\nE_{g}=E_{c}-E_{v}.\n$$\nFor cadmium chalcogenides CdX with X in Group 16, the valence band is primarily derived from the anion $p$ orbitals (X$^{2-}$), while the conduction band is predominantly derived from the Cd$^{2+}$ $5s$ orbital. Therefore,\n$$\nE_{v}\\approx E\\big(p\\text{ of X}^{2-}\\big),\\quad E_{c}\\approx E\\big(5s\\text{ of Cd}^{2+}\\big).\n$$\nAs one moves down the chalcogen group from S to Se to Te, the anion electronegativity decreases and the corresponding $p$-orbital energies increase (they are less stabilized). Hence the valence-band maximum shifts upward:\n$$\nE_{v}(\\text{Te})>E_{v}(\\text{Se})>E_{v}(\\text{S}).\n$$\nBecause the cation is the same (Cd), the conduction-band minimum $E_{c}$ is approximately fixed to first order across CdS, CdSe, and CdTe; any variations due to bond length and hybridization are smaller than the dominant shift in $E_{v}$. Consequently, from\n$$\nE_{g}=E_{c}-E_{v},\n$$\nan increase in $E_{v}$ causes a decrease in $E_{g}$. Therefore, the band gap decreases down the series:\n$$\nE_{g}(\\text{CdS})>E_{g}(\\text{CdSe})>E_{g}(\\text{CdTe}).\n$$\nThis ordering can be further reinforced by stronger spin-orbit coupling in heavier chalcogens, which elevates the valence-band edge and reduces $E_{g}$, consistent with the same trend.

This practice moves from elemental to compound semiconductors, using the modern material Gallium Nitride (GaN) as an example. You will apply the principle of valence electron counting to determine whether a specific dopant creates a p-type or n-type material, a fundamental skill in device design.

The electronic properties of GaN can be precisely controlled by introducing impurity atoms, a process known as doping.\n\nConsider two separate doping procedures for a pure GaN crystal. In the first procedure, magnesium (Mg) atoms are introduced. In the second, silicon (Si) atoms are used. In both cases, it is assumed that the dopant atoms primarily substitute for gallium (Ga) atoms within the GaN crystal lattice.\n\nTo determine the type of semiconductor created, you will need the following information about the valence electrons of the elements, which can be inferred from their group in the periodic table:\n- Gallium (Ga) is in Group 13.\n- Nitrogen (N) is in Group 15.\n- Magnesium (Mg) is in Group 2.\n- Silicon (Si) is in Group 14.\n\nBased on an analysis of valence electron count, which of these doping procedures will result in a p-type semiconductor?\n\nA.

Doping with neither silicon nor magnesium.", "solution": "To determine whether a doped semiconductor is n-type or p-type, we must compare the number of valence electrons of the dopant atom to the number of valence electrons of the host atom it replaces. A p-type semiconductor is characterized by having mobile positive 'holes' as the majority charge carriers. These holes are created when a dopant atom provides fewer valence electrons than the host atom, resulting in an electron deficit in the crystal's bonding structure. An n-type semiconductor has mobile electrons as the majority charge carriers, which occurs when a dopant atom provides more valence electrons than the host atom.\n\nThe host crystal is Gallium Nitride (GaN). The problem states we can infer valence electrons from the group number. Gallium (Ga), from Group 13, has 3 valence electrons. Nitrogen (N), from Group 15, has 5 valence electrons. In the GaN lattice, these atoms form covalent bonds. The problem specifies that in both doping scenarios, the dopant atoms substitute for gallium (Ga) atoms. Therefore, we must compare the valence electrons of each dopant with the 3 valence electrons of Ga.\n\nCase 1: Doping with Magnesium (Mg).\nMagnesium (Mg) is in Group 2, which means it has 2 valence electrons. When an Mg atom substitutes for a Ga atom (which has 3 valence electrons), there is a deficit of one electron ($3-2=1$) needed to complete the local covalent bonding structure. This electron vacancy is called a 'hole'. This hole creates an available energy state, known as an acceptor level, just above the top of the valence band. An electron from the valence band can easily gain a small amount of thermal energy and jump into this hole, leaving a new hole behind. This process allows the hole to effectively migrate through the crystal lattice, acting as a mobile positive charge carrier. Since doping with Mg creates an abundance of holes, Mg-doped GaN is a p-type semiconductor.\n\nCase 2: Doping with Silicon (Si).\nSilicon (Si) is in Group 14, which means it has 4 valence electrons. When an Si atom substitutes for a Ga atom (which has 3 valence electrons), there is an excess of one electron ($4-3=1$). Three of Si's valence electrons participate in the covalent bonding, while the fourth electron is extra and is only weakly bound to the Si nucleus. This extra electron occupies a 'donor' energy level just below the conduction band. With a small amount of thermal energy, this electron is easily excited into the conduction band, where it becomes a free-moving negative charge carrier. Since doping with Si creates an abundance of free electrons, Si-doped GaN is an n-type semiconductor.\n\nConclusion:\nThe question asks which dopant results in a p-type semiconductor. Our analysis shows that doping with magnesium creates holes (p-type), while doping with silicon provides extra electrons (n-type). Therefore, only magnesium doping results in a p-type semiconductor.
