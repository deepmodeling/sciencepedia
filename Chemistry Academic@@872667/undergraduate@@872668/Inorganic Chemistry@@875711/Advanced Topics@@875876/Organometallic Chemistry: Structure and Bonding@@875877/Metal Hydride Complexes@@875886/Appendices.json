One common synthetic route to cationic metal hydride complexes is the direct protonation of a stable, neutral metal complex that possesses a sufficiently basic metal center. Consider the formation of the cationic pentacarbonylhydridoiron(II) complex, $[HFe(CO)_5]^+$, through the reaction of a neutral iron carbonyl precursor with a strong acid. Based on principles of stability for organometallic compounds, identify the most plausible precursor from the options below.\n\nA. $Fe(CO)_4$\nB. $Fe(CO)_5$\nC. $Fe_2(CO)_9$\nD. $Fe(CO)_6$\nE. $[Fe(CO)_4]^{2-}$", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the most plausible neutral iron carbonyl precursor for the synthesis of the cationic complex $[HFe(CO)_5]^+$ via protonation. The general form of the reaction is:\n$$ \\text{Precursor} + H^+ \\rightarrow [HFe(CO)_5]^+ $$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the requirements for the precursor based on the reaction stoichiometry and the problem statement.\n1.  **Stoichiometry**: The product is a mononuclear (single metal center) complex containing one iron atom and five carbonyl (CO) ligands. The protonation reaction simply adds a proton ($H^+$) to the precursor. Therefore, the precursor must also be a mononuclear complex with the formula $Fe(CO)_5$. This immediately eliminates option C, $Fe_2(CO)_9$, which is a dinuclear complex.\n2.  **Charge**: The problem explicitly states that the precursor is a **neutral** iron carbonyl complex. This eliminates option E, $[Fe(CO)_4]^{2-}$, which is an anion with a charge of 2-.\n\nAfter applying these two conditions, we are left with three potential candidates: $Fe(CO)_4$ (Option A), $Fe(CO)_5$ (Option B), and $Fe(CO)_6$ (Option D). To determine which is the \"most plausible\", we must consider the relative stability of these compounds. In organometallic chemistry, a key principle for predicting the stability of low-valent transition metal complexes is the **18-electron rule**. This rule states that complexes in which the sum of the metal's d-electrons and the electrons donated by the ligands equals 18 are particularly stable.\n\nLet's calculate the valence electron count for each of the remaining options and the product, using the neutral ligand model. In this model, an iron (Fe) atom, being in Group 8 of the periodic table, contributes 8 valence electrons. Each neutral carbonyl (CO) ligand is a 2-electron donor.\n\nFirst, we verify that the product, $[HFe(CO)_5]^+$, is a stable species according to this rule.\n-   Contribution from Fe (Group 8): 8 electrons\n-   Contribution from 5 CO ligands: $5 \\times 2 = 10$ electrons\n-   Contribution from the H ligand (as a neutral H atom): 1 electron\n-   The overall +1 charge means we subtract one electron from the total count.\n-   Total electrons for $[HFe(CO)_5]^+$ = $8 + 10 + 1 - 1 = 18$ electrons.\nThe product is an 18-electron complex, which is consistent with it being a stable, isolable species.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the plausibility of the potential precursors by calculating their electron counts. A plausible precursor should itself be a stable compound, which means it is likely to obey the 18-electron rule.\n\n-   **Option A: $Fe(CO)_4$**\n    -   Fe: 8 electrons\n    -   4 CO: $4 \\times 2 = 8$ electrons\n    -   Total electrons = $8 + 8 = 16$ electrons.\n    A 16-electron count indicates that the complex is coordinatively unsaturated. While 16-electron complexes exist, they are often highly reactive intermediates, not stable starting materials, especially for an iron carbonyl. Thus, it is not the most plausible precursor.\n\n-   **Option B: $Fe(CO)_5$**\n    -   Fe: 8 electrons\n    -   5 CO: $5 \\times 2 = 10$ electrons\n    -   Total electrons = $8 + 10 = 18$ electrons.\n    This complex perfectly satisfies the 18-electron rule. Iron pentacarbonyl, $Fe(CO)_5$, is a well-known, stable liquid that serves as a common starting material in iron organometallic chemistry. Its stability makes it the most plausible precursor.\n\n-   **Option D: $Fe(CO)_6$**\n    -   Fe: 8 electrons\n    -   6 CO: $6 \\times 2 = 12$ electrons\n    -   Total electrons = $8 + 12 = 20$ electrons.\n    A 20-electron complex is electronically oversaturated and violates the 18-electron rule. Such complexes are generally highly unstable and do not exist as stable species for first-row transition metals like iron.\n\nBased on this analysis, $Fe(CO)_5$ is the only option that is neutral, has the correct stoichiometry, and is a stable 18-electron complex.
