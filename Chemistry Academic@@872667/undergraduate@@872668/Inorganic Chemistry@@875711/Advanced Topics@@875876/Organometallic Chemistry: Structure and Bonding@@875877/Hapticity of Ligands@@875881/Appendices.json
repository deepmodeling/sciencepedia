This practice challenges you to work like a research chemist, using the 18-electron rule as a predictive tool to deduce the unknown hapticity of a cyclooctatetraene ligand. Furthermore, it introduces the fascinating concept of fluxionality, explaining how spectroscopic data that suggests high symmetry can be reconciled with a less symmetric, static ground-state structure [@problem_id:2256651].", "problem": "An organometallic chemist synthesizes a complex with the formula $[\\text{Rh}(\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_5)(\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_8)]$.

The cyclopentadienyl ligand, $\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_5$, is known to bind in its common pentahapto fashion $(\\eta^5)$.\n\nA key piece of data comes from Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^1$H NMR) spectroscopy. At room temperature, the spectrum of the complex displays only two sharp singlets: one for the five protons of the $\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_5$ ring and one for the eight protons of the cyclooctatetraene ($\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_8$) ring. The single resonance for the $\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_8$ protons indicates that a rapid intramolecular dynamic process makes all eight of these protons chemically equivalent on the NMR timescale.\n\nTo determine the ground-state structure of this molecule, you must first deduce the hapticity of the cyclooctatetraene ligand. For the purpose of electron counting, use the ionic model and adhere to the following conventions:\n- Rhodium (Rh) is a group 9 element.\n- The cyclopentadienyl ligand ($\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_5$) should be treated as the cyclopentadienyl anion ($\\text{Cp}^−$), which is a 6-electron donor.\n- The cyclooctatetraene ligand ($\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_8$) should be treated as a neutral molecule.
