When exchange is slow relative to the NMR timescale, distinct environments appear separately.\n- In the present system, the rapid, reversible isomerization $\\eta^{3} \\rightleftharpoons \\eta^{1}$ exchanges the environments of the terminal (syn/anti) protons and interconverts the two ends of the allyl.

In a static $\\eta^{3}$-allyl coordination:\n- The central vinylic proton (on C2) is unique, giving one signal integrating to 1H.\n- Each terminal $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ has two diastereotopic protons (syn and anti relative to the metal fragment), which are not equivalent when the fluxional process is stopped.\n- In a typical $\\eta^{3}$-allyl complex with a symmetric binding mode, there is a mirror plane containing $M$ and C2 that relates the two termini. This symmetry makes the two syn protons (one on each terminus) equivalent to each other (total 2H) and the two anti protons (one on each terminus) equivalent to each other (total 2H).\n- Therefore, three sets of protons are observed: the central 1H, the pair of syn terminal protons (2H), and the pair of anti terminal protons (2H), yielding three signals with relative integrations $1:2:2$.\n\nBy contrast:\n- Option B ($1:4$) corresponds to the high-temperature, fluxionally averaged case, not the frozen $\\eta^{3}$ case.\n- Option D (single 5H signal) would require complete equivalence of all five protons, which is not possible for a static $\\eta^{3}$-allyl.\n- Option E (five separate 1H signals) would correspond to a fully unsymmetrical environment making all four terminal protons distinct; this is not the expected pattern for a typical static, symmetrically bound $\\eta^{3}$-allyl.\n- Option C lists the same counts as A but the correct description emphasizes one unique 1H resonance and two equivalent 2H sets, conventionally written as $1:2:2$.\n\nThus, at 180 K the allyl group shows three signals with relative integrations $1:2:2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2300679"}, {"introduction": "Once a dynamic process is identified, the next step is to uncover its underlying mechanism. This advanced problem puts you in the role of a mechanistic detective, using a classic chemical tool—isotopic labeling—to distinguish between two competing pathways for allyl ligand exchange.

The allyl ligand's carbons are labeled C1, C2, and C3.

In this pathway, the metal detaches from two of the carbons to form a $\\sigma$-bond with a terminal carbon (e.g., C1 or C3).

The initial isotopologue has D at S1.\n\nMechanism II is defined as rigid rotation of the entire $\\eta^{3}$-allyl ligand as a single unit about the axis passing through the metal and the allyl midpoint. This motion preserves all internal geometrical relationships within the allyl fragment (no C–C bond rotation, no inversion of the allyl plane), and only reorients the entire allyl relative to the metal.\n\nUnder this rigid body rotation, the two terminal carbons are exchanged, while the syn/anti designation, being defined purely by the internal geometry of the allyl (relative to the C2–H and the C1–C3 vector), is preserved. Therefore, the symmetry operation induced by a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation about the M–centroid axis is the permutation\n$$\nR_{\\pi}:\\quad S1 \\leftrightarrow S3,\\quad S2 \\leftrightarrow S4.\n$$\nCrucially, there is no operation in Mechanism II that maps syn to anti or vice versa: transitions $S1 \\leftrightarrow S2$ or $S3 \\leftrightarrow S4$ require internal bond rotation or allyl-face inversion, which do not occur in a rigid rotation.\n\nStarting from $S1$, the closure of accessible states under repeated applications of $R_{\\pi}$ is $\\{S1, S3\\}$. By the symmetry of the $\\eta^{3}$-allyl coordination, C1 and C3 are equivalent, so the free energies of $S1$ and $S3$ are equal.
