The $\\pi$-backbonding component of the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model is highly sensitive to the energy of the alkene's $\\pi^*$ antibonding orbital (LUMO). This practice guides you to analyze how different substituents on an alkene can either enhance or diminish its ability to accept electron density from the metal, a key factor in tuning the properties of these complexes. [@problem_id:2268111]", "problem": "In inorganic chemistry, the bonding between a transition metal and an alkene is described by the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model. This model involves two main components: first, a σ-donation of electron density from the alkene's filled π-bonding orbital (the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital, or HOMO) to an empty d-orbital on the metal; and second, a π-backbonding interaction where electron density is donated from a filled metal d-orbital to the alkene's empty π* antibonding orbital (the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital, or LUMO). The strength of an alkene as a π-acceptor is determined by the ability of its π* orbital to accept this back-donated electron density. A lower energy for the π* orbital generally leads to stronger backbonding and thus greater π-acceptor character.\n\nConsider the following three alkenes:\n1. Ethene (C₂H₄)\n2. cis-2-Butene ((CH₃)₂C₂H₂)\n3.

The π-acceptor strength is directly related to the energy of the alkene's Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), which is the π* antibonding orbital. A lower LUMO energy allows for a better energetic overlap with the filled d-orbitals of the metal, facilitating stronger π-backbonding. We must therefore analyze how the substituents on each alkene affect the energy of its π* orbital.\n\nStep 1: Analyze tetrafluoroethene (C₂F₄).\nFluorine is the most electronegative element. The C-F bonds are highly polar, with fluorine atoms withdrawing electron density from the carbon atoms. This is a strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect (-I effect). This withdrawal of electron density from the carbon-carbon double bond has a profound stabilizing effect on all the molecular orbitals of the π system, including both the filled π (HOMO) and the empty π* (LUMO). By significantly lowering the energy of the π* LUMO, tetrafluoroethene becomes a very effective acceptor of electron density from the metal. Therefore, C₂F₄ is expected to be a strong π-acceptor.\n\nStep 2: Analyze ethene (C₂H₄).\nEthene is the simplest alkene, with only hydrogen atoms as substituents. The C-H bond has very low polarity, and hydrogen is generally considered to have a negligible inductive effect compared to alkyl or halogen substituents. Thus, ethene serves as a neutral benchmark against which the other two substituted alkenes can be compared.\n\nStep 3: Analyze cis-2-butene ((CH₃)₂C₂H₂).\nThis alkene has two methyl (CH₃) groups attached to the C=C double bond. Alkyl groups, such as methyl, are known to be electron-donating groups. They exhibit a positive inductive effect (+I effect), pushing electron density towards the double bond. This donation of electron density has a destabilizing effect on the π* orbital, raising its energy. A higher-energy LUMO results in a poorer energetic match with the metal's d-orbitals, making it more difficult for the alkene to accept back-donated electrons. Consequently, cis-2-butene is expected to be a weak π-acceptor.\n\nStep 4: Synthesize the final ranking.\nWe compare the LUMO energies of the three alkenes based on the electronic effects of their substituents:\n- Tetrafluoroethene (C₂F₄): Strong electron-withdrawing F groups → Lowest energy LUMO.\n- Ethene (C₂H₄): No significant electronic effects from H atoms → Intermediate energy LUMO.\n- cis-2-Butene: Electron-donating CH₃ groups → Highest energy LUMO.\n\nSince π-acceptor strength is inversely related to the LUMO energy, the order from strongest π-acceptor to weakest π-acceptor is:\ntetrafluoroethene > ethene > cis-2-butene.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2268111"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise requires you to synthesize all the core concepts of the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model into a cohesive analysis. By comparing two different metal-alkene complexes, you will predict how factors like the metal's identity, its oxidation state, and the presence of competing ligands collectively influence the degree of $\\pi$-backdonation and its observable consequences. This integrated reasoning is crucial for interpreting spectroscopic data and understanding how chemists rationally design catalysts and new materials. [@problem_id:2268166]", "problem": "The Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model provides a framework for understanding the bonding between a transition metal and an alkene. This model involves two key interactions: a sigma ($\\sigma$) donation from the alkene's filled $\\pi$ bonding orbital to an empty metal d-orbital, and a pi ($\\pi$) back-donation from a filled metal d-orbital to the alkene's empty $\\pi^*$ antibonding orbital. The extent of $\\pi$-back-donation has a direct, observable effect on the C=C bond within the coordinated alkene.\n\nConsider two different metal-alkene complexes:\n- Complex A: $[Cr(CO)_5(\\eta^2-C_2H_4)]$\n- Complex B: The anion of Zeise's salt, $[PtCl_3(\\eta^2-C_2H_4)]^-$\n\nBased on your understanding of the electronic properties of the metals and their attendant ligands, how does the C=C bond length in the coordinated ethene ligand of Complex A compare to that in Complex B?\n\nA.

The C=C bond lengths in the coordinated ethene of Complex A and Complex B are identical.\n\nD. Both complexes exhibit a C=C bond length that is shorter than the C=C bond in a molecule of free, uncoordinated ethene ($C_2H_4$).", "solution": "The central concept required to solve this problem is the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model and how the electronic environment of the metal center influences $\\pi$-back-donation.\n\nThe model describes the metal-alkene bond as having two components:\n1.  **$\\sigma$-donation**: The filled $\\pi$-orbital of the alkene donates electron density to an empty, appropriately oriented orbital on the metal.\n2.  **$\\pi$-back-donation**: A filled d-orbital on the metal donates electron density back into the empty $\\pi^*$ (antibonding) orbital of the alkene.\n\nThe key to this problem lies in the second component. When $\\pi$-back-donation occurs, electron density is added to the $\\pi^*$ antibonding orbital of the C=C double bond. Populating an antibonding orbital weakens the bond, causing it to increase in length. Therefore, the greater the extent of $\\pi$-back-donation from the metal to the alkene, the longer the C=C bond will be.\n\nWe must now analyze the electronic factors in each complex that control the extent of $\\pi$-back-donation to the ethene ligand.\n\n**Analysis of Complex A: $[Cr(CO)_5(\\eta^2-C_2H_4)]$**\n*   **Metal and Oxidation State**: The complex is neutral. Both ethene ($C_2H_4$) and carbonyl (CO) are neutral ligands, so the chromium (Cr) is in the (0) oxidation state. Cr(0) is a $d^6$ species.\n*   **Ligand Environment and Competition**: The Cr center is coordinated to five CO ligands. Carbonyl ligands are extremely strong $\\pi$-acceptors. They compete very effectively with the ethene for the back-donated electron density from the Cr(0) center. Because CO is a much stronger $\\pi$-acceptor than ethene, most of the metal's back-donating capacity is directed towards the five CO ligands. Consequently, $\\pi$-back-donation to the ethene ligand is relatively weak.\n\n**Analysis of Complex B: $[PtCl_3(\\eta^2-C_2H_4)]^-$**\n*   **Metal and Oxidation State**: The complex has an overall charge of -1. Each chloride ligand (Cl) has a formal charge of -1, and ethene is neutral. The oxidation state of Platinum (Pt) is therefore +2. Pt(II) is a $d^8$ species.\n*   **Ligand Environment and Competition**: The Pt center is coordinated to three Cl⁻ ligands, which are good $\\sigma$-donors and very weak $\\pi$-donors. Crucially, they are not $\\pi$-acceptors and do not compete with ethene for back-donation.\n*   **Metal Identity**: Pt is a 3rd-row (5d) transition metal, while Cr is a 1st-row (3d) metal. The 5d orbitals of Pt are more diffuse (larger) and higher in energy than the 3d orbitals of Cr, which generally leads to more effective orbital overlap and stronger back-donation.\n\n**Conclusion**\nTo determine which complex has the longer C=C bond, we must compare the extent of $\\pi$-back-donation to the ethene ligand in each case.\n*   In **Complex A**, while the Cr(0) center is intrinsically electron-rich, its ability to back-donate to ethene is severely hampered by overwhelming competition from the five powerful $\\pi$-accepting CO ligands.\n*   In **Complex B**, the Pt(II) center is in a higher oxidation state, but this is offset by two strong effects: (1) Pt is a 3rd-row metal (a more effective back-donor than 1st-row Cr), and (2) there is no competition from other $\\pi$-accepting ligands.\n\nThe decisive factor is the competition. The ethene in Complex B receives the full back-donating attention of the Pt(II) center, whereas the ethene in Complex A receives very little. Therefore, $\\pi$-back-donation is significantly greater in Complex B than in Complex A. Greater back-donation leads to a longer C=C bond.\n\nThus, the C=C bond in Complex B is longer than in Complex A. This is equivalent to stating that the C=C bond is shorter in Complex A than in Complex B.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. The C=C bond is longer in Complex A than in Complex B. (Incorrect)\nB. The C=C bond is shorter in Complex A than in Complex B. (Correct)\nC. The C=C bond lengths in the coordinated ethene of Complex A and Complex B are identical. (Incorrect)\nD. Both complexes exhibit a C=C bond length that is shorter than the C=C bond in a molecule of free, uncoordinated ethene ($C_2H_4$).
