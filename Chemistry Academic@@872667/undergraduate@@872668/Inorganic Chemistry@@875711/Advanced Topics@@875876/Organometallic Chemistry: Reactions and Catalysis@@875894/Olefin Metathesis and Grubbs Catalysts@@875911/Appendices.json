A key skill for any chemist using this reaction is the ability to look at a target ring and determine the appropriate starting material.

A particularly useful variant is Ring-Closing Metathesis (RCM), which allows for the synthesis of cyclic alkenes from acyclic dienes. In a typical RCM reaction involving two terminal alkene groups, an acyclic diene is converted into a cyclic alkene and a molecule of ethene gas.\n\nAn organic chemist aims to synthesize cyclohexene using an RCM reaction.

For a linear substrate of the form $H_2C=CH-(CH_2)_m-CH=CH_2$, RCM yields a cycloalkene with $m+2$ ring members and ethene ($H_2C=CH_2$) as a byproduct. This follows because the two terminal alkene carbons become the two vinylic carbons in the ring, and the methylene spacer contributes $m$ additional ring atoms, giving a total of $m+2$ ring members.\n\nRelating this to the 1,$p$-diene nomenclature: the chain contains $m+4$ carbons overall, so $m = (m+4)-4$, and the second double bond is at position $p=m+3$. Thus, $m = p-3$ and the ring size is\n$$\nn_{\\text{ring}} = m+2 = (p-3)+2 = p-1.\n$$\nTherefore, a 1,$p$-diene closes to a $(p-1)$-membered ring.

In ring-closing metathesis, the desired intramolecular cyclization often competes with an undesired intermolecular polymerization pathway.

The starting material is a long-chain, acyclic diene dissolved in a suitable solvent, and the reaction is initiated by adding a Grubbs catalyst. The desired outcome is the formation of a single large ring through an intramolecular reaction. However, a competing side reaction can occur where two or more diene molecules react with each other to form linear oligomers or larger polymer chains through an intermolecular process.\n\nThe chemist initially runs the reaction at a very low concentration of the diene and observes a good yield of the desired intramolecular RCM product. To scale up the synthesis and increase throughput, the chemist proposes running the reaction again but this time using a significantly higher initial concentration of the diene, while keeping all other conditions (temperature, catalyst loading, solvent) identical.\n\nHow will this increase in initial diene concentration affect the relative amounts of the products formed?\n\nA.

The key to understanding the effect of concentration is to analyze the kinetics of each competing pathway.\n\nLet's denote the acyclic diene starting material as $D$.\n\nThe intramolecular RCM reaction involves a single molecule of the diene cyclizing to form the macrocyclic product, $P_{intra}$. The rate of this reaction depends on the concentration of the diene. Since it is a unimolecular process with respect to the diene, its rate law can be written as:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{intra}} = k_{\\text{intra}} [D]\n$$\nHere, $k_{\\text{intra}}$ is the rate constant for the intramolecular reaction, and $[D]$ is the concentration of the diene. This is a first-order process in $[D]$.\n\nThe intermolecular reaction involves two molecules of the diene reacting to form a dimer, which can then react further to form oligomers, $P_{inter}$. The initial step of this process is bimolecular. The rate law for the formation of the initial dimer is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{inter}} = k_{\\text{inter}} [D][D] = k_{\\text{inter}} [D]^{2}\n$$\nHere, $k_{\\text{inter}}$ is the rate constant for the intermolecular reaction. This is a second-order process in $[D]$.\n\nTo determine which pathway is favored, we can examine the ratio of the rates of the two competing reactions:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{intra}}}{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{inter}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{intra}} [D]}{k_{\\text{inter}} [D]^{2}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{intra}}}{k_{\\text{inter}}} \\frac{1}{[D]}\n$$\nThe ratio of the products formed, $\\frac{[P_{\\text{intra}}]}{[P_{\\text{inter}}]}$, will be proportional to the ratio of their formation rates.\n\nFrom this expression, we can see that the ratio of the intramolecular rate to the intermolecular rate is inversely proportional to the concentration of the diene, $[D]$.\n\n- At **low concentrations** of $[D]$, the term $\\frac{1}{[D]}$ is large, which makes the ratio $\\frac{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{intra}}}{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{inter}}}$ large. This means the intramolecular reaction is favored, leading to a higher yield of the RCM product. This is consistent with the initial successful experiment described in the problem.\n\n- At **high concentrations** of $[D]$, the term $\\frac{1}{[D]}$ becomes smaller, which makes the ratio $\\frac{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{intra}}}{\\text{Rate}_{\\text{inter}}}$ small. This means the intermolecular reaction rate increases more significantly than the intramolecular rate, and the intermolecular pathway becomes dominant.\n\nTherefore, significantly increasing the initial concentration of the diene will favor the second-order intermolecular reaction over the first-order intramolecular reaction. This will lead to a greater proportion of intermolecular oligomers and a smaller proportion of the desired intramolecular RCM product. Consequently, the ratio of the intramolecular RCM product to the intermolecular oligomers will decrease.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\nA. The ratio will increase. This is incorrect; it is the opposite of what happens. This would be true if the concentration were decreased.\nB. The ratio will decrease. This is correct. The higher concentration favors the higher-order intermolecular reaction.\nC. The ratio will remain unchanged. This is incorrect as it ignores the different kinetic orders of the two competing reactions.\nD. Both reactions will be suppressed. This is incorrect. Increasing reactant concentration generally increases reaction rates.\nE. Only the intramolecular product will form. This is incorrect.

The active catalyst is the methylidene complex $[L_nRu=CH_2]$. The RCM reaction produces cyclopentene and one molecule of ethylene per turnover. The isotopic composition of the ethylene byproduct provides insight into the operating mechanism.\n\nLet's analyze each scenario based on the Chauvin mechanism for olefin metathesis.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario A ($k_{RCM} \\gg k_{deg}$)**\n\nIn this scenario, the only significant pathway is the productive RCM. We are asked for the *initial* distribution of products. At the beginning of the reaction, the only catalyst species present is $[L_nRu=CH_2]$. This catalyst reacts with the substrate $S_{d2}$. The substrate has two distinct terminal olefin groups: a non-deuterated $H_2C=CH-$ group and a deuterated $D_2C=CH-$ group. Since we ignore kinetic isotope effects, the catalyst is equally likely to react with either end.\n\n**Path A1: Initiation at the non-deuterated terminus ($H_2C=CH-$)**\nThe $[L_nRu=CH_2]$ catalyst reacts with the $H_2C=CH-$ end of $S_{d2}$. This is an olefin metathesis reaction that releases one molecule of ethylene and generates a new ruthenium alkylidene.\n$$[L_nRu=CH_2] + H_2C=CH(CH_2)_2CH=CD_2 \\longrightarrow [L_nRu=CH(CH_2)_2CH=CD_2] + H_2C=CH_2$$\nThe ethylene produced is unlabeled ($d_0$-ethylene, $CH_2=CH_2$). The newly formed alkylidene then rapidly undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form the final product and regenerate a catalyst, but this second step does not produce ethylene.\n\n**Path A2: Initiation at the deuterated terminus ($D_2C=CH-$)**\nThe $[L_nRu=CH_2]$ catalyst reacts with the $D_2C=CH-$ end of $S_{d2}$. This reaction releases a different ethylene isotopologue.\n$$[L_nRu=CH_2] + D_2C=CH(CH_2)_2CH=CH_2 \\longrightarrow [L_nRu=CH(CH_2)_2CH=CH_2] + H_2C=CD_2$$\nThe ethylene produced is $d_2$-ethylene ($CH_2=CD_2$).\n\nSince the initial reaction of the catalyst must occur via one of these two equally probable paths, the very first molecules of ethylene evolved will be an equimolar mixture of $CH_2=CH_2$ and $CH_2=CD_2$. No $CD_2=CD_2$ ($d_4$-ethylene) can be formed initially, as this would require a $[L_nRu=CD_2]$ catalyst species, which has not yet been formed.\nTherefore, the initial molar ratio of $(CH_2=CH_2 : CH_2=CD_2 : CD_2=CD_2)$ for Scenario A is **(1:1:0)**.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario B ($k_{deg} \\gg k_{RCM}$)**\n\nIn this scenario, a fast, reversible degenerate metathesis occurs before any significant amount of the slower RCM takes place. This degenerate process exchanges the methylidene group on the catalyst with the terminal methylidene groups of the substrate.\nThe relevant equilibrium is:\n$$[L_nRu=CH_2] + H_2C=CH(CH_2)_2CH=CD_2 \\rightleftharpoons [L_nRu=CD_2] + H_2C=CH(CH_2)_2CH=CH_2$$\nThe substrate, $S_{d2}$, is present in large excess. It acts as a vast reservoir containing an equal number of $H_2C=$ and $D_2C=$ terminal groups. The catalyst's methylidene group will rapidly exchange with this reservoir until an equilibrium is established for the catalyst pool. Because the reservoir has a 1:1 ratio of $H_2C=$ and $D_2C=$ groups, the catalyst pool will quickly reach a steady state where $[[L_nRu=CH_2]] \\approx [[L_nRu=CD_2]]$.\nSo, before any significant RCM, the active catalyst exists as a **1:1 mixture of $[L_nRu=CH_2]$ and $[L_nRu=CD_2]$**.\n\nNow, this equilibrated catalyst mixture reacts via the slower RCM pathway with the substrate, which is still almost entirely un-scrambled $S_{d2}$. We need to determine the ethylene distribution from the reaction of this 1:1 catalyst mixture with $S_{d2}$. We can analyze the four possible initial reaction events, each having an equal probability of $0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$:\n\n1.  **Catalyst $[L_nRu=CH_2]$ reacts at the $H_2C=$ end of $S_{d2}$:** This produces $CH_2=CH_2$ ($d_0$-ethylene).\n    (Probability: $0.5_{cat} \\times 0.5_{site} = 0.25$)\n\n2.  **Catalyst $[L_nRu=CH_2]$ reacts at the $D_2C=$ end of $S_{d2}$:** This produces $CH_2=CD_2$ ($d_2$-ethylene).\n    (Probability: $0.5_{cat} \\times 0.5_{site} = 0.25$)\n\n3.  **Catalyst $[L_nRu=CD_2]$ reacts at the $H_2C=$ end of $S_{d2}$:** This produces $CH_2=CD_2$ ($d_2$-ethylene).\n    (Probability: $0.5_{cat} \\times 0.5_{site} = 0.25$)\n\n4.  **Catalyst $[L_nRu=CD_2]$ reacts at the $D_2C=$ end of $S_{d2}$:** This produces $CD_2=CD_2$ ($d_4$-ethylene).\n    (Probability: $0.5_{cat} \\times 0.5_{site} = 0.25$)\n\nNow, we sum the probabilities to find the overall initial ratio:\n*   Total probability for $CH_2=CH_2$ ($d_0$): 0.25\n*   Total probability for $CH_2=CD_2$ ($d_2$): 0.25 (from event 2) + 0.25 (from event 3) = 0.50\n*   Total probability for $CD_2=CD_2$ ($d_4$): 0.25\n\nThe relative amounts of the produced ethylene isotopologues are proportional to these probabilities. Thus, the initial molar ratio of $(CH_2=CH_2 : CH_2=CD_2 : CD_2=CD_2)$ for Scenario B is (0.25 : 0.50 : 0.25), which simplifies to **(1:2:1)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nFor Scenario A, the predicted ratio is (1:1:0).\nFor Scenario B, the predicted ratio is (1:2:1).\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2275216"}]}
