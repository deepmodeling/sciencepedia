This practice challenges you to compare the rates of electrophilic attack for ferrocene and its heavier congeners, ruthenocene and osmocene. By analyzing this trend [@problem_id:2250437], you will uncover the crucial role the central metal plays in stabilizing the reaction intermediate, ultimately demonstrating how periodic properties govern the kinetics of reactions on coordinated ligands.", "problem": "The group 8 metallocenes, ferrocene ($(\\eta^5\\text{-C}_5\\text{H}_5)_2\\text{Fe}$), ruthenocene ($(\\eta^5\\text{-C}_5\\text{H}_5)_2\\text{Ru}$), and osmocene ($(\\eta^5\\text{-C}_5\\text{H}_5)_2\\text{Os}$), are known for their rich aromatic-like chemistry. They readily undergo electrophilic substitution reactions, such as Friedel-Crafts acylation, on their cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings.\n\nConsider the relative rates of acylation for this series of compounds under identical reaction conditions. Which of the following statements correctly identifies the order of reactivity and provides the best chemical reasoning for this trend?\n\nA. Ferrocene > Ruthenocene > Osmocene. This is because the Metal-Cp bond strength increases down the group (Fe < Ru < Os). The stronger bond in osmocene makes the structural distortion required to stabilize the cationic reaction intermediate energetically less favorable, thus slowing the reaction.\n\nB. Osmocene > Ruthenocene > Ferrocene. This is because the polarizability and electron-donating ability of the metal center increase down the group, making the Cp rings more nucleophilic and thus more reactive towards electrophiles.\n\nC. Ferrocene > Ruthenocene > Osmocene. This is because the electronegativity of the metal increases down the group (Fe > Ru > Os), leading to greater net electron withdrawal from the Cp rings and deactivating them for heavier metals.\n\nD. The rates are approximately equal (Ferrocene ≈ Ruthenocene ≈ Os). This is because the chemistry is dominated by the cyclopentadienyl rings, which are identical in all three complexes, and the central metal has a negligible effect on the ring's reactivity.", "solution": "We analyze the electrophilic substitution (acylation) of group 8 metallocenes on their cyclopentadienyl rings. The general mechanism is analogous to aromatic electrophilic substitution and proceeds through a cationic, Wheland-type intermediate on the Cp ring. In metallocenes, stabilization of this intermediate requires structural distortion of the sandwich complex, typically involving a change in hapticity (ring slippage, e.g., partial change from $\\eta^5$ coordination), and redistribution of electron density between the metal and the Cp ring to delocalize positive charge. Consequently, the rate depends on how easily the metallocene framework can undergo the required distortion and how effectively the metal can stabilize the developing cationic character.\n\nKey principle: The energetic cost to reach the cationic intermediate correlates with the strength and rigidity of the metal–Cp interaction. Stronger metal–Cp bonding disfavors the structural relaxation (ring slippage and bond reorganization) needed to stabilize the intermediate, increasing the activation barrier and decreasing the rate.\n\nPeriodic trend: Down group 8 from Fe to Ru to Os, metal–Cp bonding generally becomes stronger and more covalent due to the greater radial extension and better overlap of the $4d$ and $5d$ orbitals with the Cp $\\pi$ system, as well as lower $d$-orbital energies that increase metal–ligand bonding. This increased bond strength and rigidity makes ring slippage more energetically costly for ruthenocene than ferrocene, and even more so for osmocene. Therefore, the rate of electrophilic substitution decreases down the group:\nFerrocene reacts fastest, then ruthenocene, then osmocene.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- Option A states the order Ferrocene $>$ Ruthenocene $>$ Osmocene and attributes it to increasing metal–Cp bond strength down the group, making the distortion to stabilize the cationic intermediate less favorable for heavier congeners. This aligns with the mechanistic rationale above.\n- Option B reverses the order and invokes increased polarizability and electron donation down the group to enhance nucleophilicity. This contradicts the observed decrease in reactivity and overlooks the dominant effect of increased bond strength and reduced ease of ring slippage in $4d/5d$ metallocenes.\n- Option C gives the correct order but provides an incorrect rationale: it claims electronegativity increases as Fe $>$ Ru $>$ Os and that electron withdrawal increases down the group. The stated electronegativity trend is incorrect and does not appropriately explain the observed reactivity.\n- Option D claims similar rates because the Cp ligands are identical. This ignores the critical role of the metal in stabilizing the intermediate and in controlling the ease of ring slippage, which significantly impacts the rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2250437"}, {"introduction": "When a metal is bound to two different rings, which one will an electrophile \"choose\" to attack? This exercise [@problem_id:2250431] presents a mixed-sandwich complex containing both a cyclopentadienyl and a tropylium ligand, forcing a decision on the site of reaction. To determine the outcome, you will apply fundamental electronic principles, using formal ligand charges to assess the relative nucleophilicity of each ring and predict the course of the reaction.", "problem": "Consider the stable, yet paramagnetic, mixed-sandwich organometallic complex, $(\\eta^5-C_5H_5)V(\\eta^7-C_7H_7)$. In organometallic chemistry, the electronic properties and reactivity of such complexes are often analyzed by considering the formal charges of the ligands that would render them aromatic. For the ligands in this complex, these are the 6$\\pi$-electron cyclopentadienyl anion ($C_5H_5^-$) and the 6$\\pi$-electron tropylium cation ($C_7H_7^+$). An electrophile is a chemical species that is attracted to electron-rich centers and participates in reactions by accepting an electron pair.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the site of electrophilic attack (e.g., Friedel-Crafts acylation) on the $(\\eta^5-C_5H_5)V(\\eta^7-C_7H_7)$ complex?\n\nA. The $\\eta^7-C_7H_7$ ring is more susceptible to attack because it is a larger ring system and its interaction with the metal's d-orbitals makes it more electron-rich.\nB. Both rings are equally susceptible to attack because the central vanadium atom facilitates complete delocalization of charge between the two rings, resulting in identical electron density.\nC. The $\\eta^5-C_5H_5$ ring is more susceptible to attack because the formal description of the ligands as $C_5H_5^-$ and $C_7H_7^+$ implies that the cyclopentadienyl ring is the more nucleophilic of the two.\nD. The $\\eta^7-C_7H_7$ ring is more susceptible to attack. Since it is formally a cation, it is a strong $\\pi$-acceptor, and the vanadium atom will heavily donate electron density into its antibonding orbitals, making it the most electron-rich ring.\nE. Neither ring will undergo electrophilic attack, as the paramagnetic nature of the complex means the unpaired electron at the metal center is the most reactive site.", "solution": "We first assign the formal charges to the ligands that render them aromatic. The cyclopentadienyl ring is described as $C_5H_5^-$ (a $6\\pi$-electron aromatic anion) and the tropylium ring as $C_7H_7^+$ (a $6\\pi$-electron aromatic cation). Denote their formal charges as $q_{\\text{Cp}}=-1$ and $q_{\\text{Tr}}=+1$.\n\nFor the neutral complex $(\\eta^5-C_5H_5)V(\\eta^7-C_7H_7)$, overall charge conservation gives\n$$q_{\\text{complex}}=0=q_{\\text{V}}+q_{\\text{Cp}}+q_{\\text{Tr}},$$\nso\n$$q_{\\text{V}}=0.$$\nThus, the vanadium oxidation state is zero.\n\nNext, we perform electron counting to confirm the paramagnetism and assess bonding. Let $g$ be the group number of vanadium, so $g=5$. The $\\eta^5$ $C_5H_5^-$ donates $6$ electrons and the $\\eta^7$ $C_7H_7^+$ donates $6$ electrons as well. The valence electron count is\n$$VE=g+6+6=5+6+6=17,$$\nwhich predicts a $17$-electron, paramagnetic complex, consistent with the statement.\n\nNow, we analyze relative electron density at the two rings to predict the site of electrophilic attack by an electrophile $E^{+}$. The $C_5H_5^-$ ligand is a strong $\\pi$-donor and is formally an anion, so it carries excess electron density. The $C_7H_7^+$ ligand is a $\\pi$-acceptor and is formally a cation, so it is electron-deficient. Even allowing for metal-to-ligand backbonding, the cationic tropylium ring remains the more electron-poor ring relative to the anionic cyclopentadienyl ring. Therefore, the inequality in electron densities at the ring carbons can be expressed qualitatively as\n$$\\rho_{\\text{Cp}}>\\rho_{\\text{Tr}},$$\nwhere $\\rho_{\\text{Cp}}$ and $\\rho_{\\text{Tr}}$ denote the electron densities at the cyclopentadienyl and tropylium rings, respectively.\n\nElectrophilic aromatic substitution proceeds at the most electron-rich site. Hence, $E^{+}$ will preferentially attack the $\\eta^5-C_5H_5$ ring rather than the $\\eta^7-C_7H_7$ ring.\n\nThis reasoning directly supports the statement that the cyclopentadienyl ring is more nucleophilic due to its formal anionic character and stronger $\\pi$-donor nature, whereas the tropylium ring is comparatively electron-poor and $\\pi$-accepting. Therefore, among the options, the statement that uses the formal $C_5H_5^-$ and $C_7H_7^+$ description to identify the cyclopentadienyl ring as the preferred site for electrophilic attack is the most accurate. Options asserting equal susceptibility or enhanced reactivity at the tropylium ring due to size or backdonation overlook the intrinsic electron-withdrawing character of the $C_7H_7^+$ ligand, and paramagnetism does not preclude electrophilic substitution at the ring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2250431"}, {"introduction": "Electrophilic attack is not limited to the carbon frameworks of organic ligands; the heteroatoms of ligands like carbon monoxide ($CO$) are also common targets.

The frequency will decrease significantly, as the Lewis acid enhances the pi-acceptor character of the carbonyl ligand, leading to increased metal-to-ligand back-donation.\n\nC. The frequency will remain essentially unchanged, as the interaction is primarily at the oxygen atom's lone pair, which is largely non-bonding with respect to the carbon-oxygen bond.\n\nD. The metal-carbon bond will break, and the frequency will revert to a value near that of free carbon monoxide.\n\nE. The frequency will decrease slightly due to the increased mass of the vibrating C-O-AlCl3 unit.", "solution": "We analyze the change in the C-O stretching frequency upon coordination of a Lewis acid to the oxygen of a terminal CO ligand using the harmonic oscillator model for vibrational spectroscopy and the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson bonding model.\n\nFor a diatomic-like stretching mode, the fundamental vibrational frequency (expressed as a wavenumber) is given by\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}},\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light, $k$ is the force constant associated with the C-O bond, and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the C-O pair, given by\n$$\n\\mu=\\frac{m_{C}m_{O}}{m_{C}+m_{O}}.\n$$\nUpon coordination of a Lewis acid such as $AlCl_3$ to the oxygen atom of a specific carbonyl ligand, the mass of the vibrating atoms in the C-O stretching coordinate remains dominated by carbon and oxygen; thus $\\mu$ for the localized C-O stretch is essentially unchanged.
