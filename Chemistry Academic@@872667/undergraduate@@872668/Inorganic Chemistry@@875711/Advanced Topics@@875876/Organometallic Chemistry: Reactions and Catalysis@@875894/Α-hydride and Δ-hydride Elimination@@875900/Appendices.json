Such a six-membered transition state can adopt conformations that minimize steric interactions, notably placing the $\\beta$-methyl substituent in an equatorial orientation and oriented away from the metal and the bulky $L_{n}$. The hydride transfer occurs at a more remote carbon, distributing the geometry over a larger ring and allowing dihedral adjustments to reduce 1,3-diaxial and metal–ligand clashes.
