A key event in hydroformylation is the migratory insertion of the alkene into a metal-hydride bond, a step that defines the stereochemistry of the final product.

This reaction involves the overall addition of a hydrogen atom (H) and a formyl group (-CHO) across the carbon-carbon double bond, typically in the presence of a cobalt-based catalyst, to produce a saturated aldehyde. For this specific substrate, the formyl group becomes attached to one of the carbons of the original double bond (which we will label C1), while a hydrogen atom is added to the other carbon of the original double bond (labeled C2). The two deuterium atoms (D) from the starting material remain on carbons C1 and C2.\n\nAssuming the reaction proceeds via a single dominant mechanistic pathway to yield one major stereoisomer, identify the correct description of the relative stereochemistry of this product from the options below.

The deuterium at C1 and the deuterium at C2 are *trans*.", "solution": "The problem asks for the stereochemical outcome of the hydroformylation of a specifically labeled alkene, (Z)-1,2-dideuteriocyclohexene. To determine the correct stereoisomer of the product, we must analyze the stereochemistry of the starting material and the mechanism of the reaction.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the stereochemistry of the starting material.\nThe starting material is (Z)-1,2-dideuteriocyclohexene. The (Z) designation (from the German *zusammen*, meaning \"together\") indicates that the two deuterium atoms are on the same side of the carbon-carbon double bond. In the context of the cyclohexane ring, this means the two deuterium atoms are *cis* to each other. During the reaction, the single bonds between the carbons and the deuterium atoms are not broken. Therefore, in the final saturated cyclohexane product, the deuterium atom at C1 and the deuterium atom at C2 must retain their *cis* relationship. This immediately allows us to eliminate options C and D, which describe the deuterium atoms as being *trans*.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the mechanism of hydroformylation.\nThe hydroformylation reaction catalyzed by cobalt complexes, such as hydridocobalt tetracarbonyl ($HCo(CO)_4$), proceeds through a series of steps. The stereochemistry of the overall addition is determined by the migratory insertion of the alkene into the metal-hydride bond.\nThe key steps are:\n1.  Coordination of the alkene's $\\pi$-bond to the cobalt center.\n2.  Migratory insertion of the coordinated alkene into the Co-H bond. This step is a concerted process that occurs through a four-membered cyclic transition state involving the cobalt atom, the hydride hydrogen, and the two carbons of the double bond (C1 and C2).\n3.  In this transition state, the hydride ligand and the cobalt atom are transferred to the same face of the alkene double bond. This mode of addition is known as a *syn*-addition. As a result, the newly formed H-C2 bond and Co-C1 bond are *cis* to each other in the resulting cobalt-alkyl intermediate.\n\nStep 3: Relate the mechanism to the final product.\nThe cobalt-alkyl intermediate undergoes further steps, including CO insertion into the Co-C1 bond and subsequent reaction (e.g., with $H_2$ or another molecule of $HCo(CO)_4$) to release the final aldehyde product. The crucial point is that these subsequent steps occur at the cobalt center and replace the Co atom with a -CHO group without inverting the stereochemistry at the carbon C1. Therefore, the stereochemical relationship established during the initial *syn*-addition of the H and Co is preserved in the final product. The net result is that the added hydrogen atom (at C2) and the newly formed formyl group (at C1) are *cis* to each other.\n\nStep 4: Combine the findings to select the correct option.\nFrom Step 1, we determined that the two deuterium atoms must be *cis* in the product.\nFrom Step 3, we determined that the added H atom and the -CHO group must be *cis* in the product.\nLet's examine the remaining options:\n-   Option A: States that the formyl group at C1 and the added hydrogen at C2 are *cis*, and the deuterium atoms are also *cis*. This is consistent with our analysis of a *syn*-addition to a (Z)-alkene.\n-   Option B: States that the formyl group and the added hydrogen are *trans*. This would imply an *anti*-addition, which is not the operative mechanism for this reaction.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly describes the stereochemistry of the product resulting from the established mechanism of hydroformylation is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2258991"}, {"introduction": "Connecting fundamental principles to industrial application is a key goal of chemical education. In the commercial production of aldehydes via hydroformylation, controlling the regioselectivity—the ratio of the desired linear product to the branched isomer ($n/iso$)—is paramount for economic efficiency. This problem explores how chemists can manipulate reaction conditions, such as the partial pressure of carbon monoxide, to influence the catalyst's structure and steer the reaction toward the more valuable product, demonstrating the delicate balance between steric effects, ligand equilibria, and reaction outcome.", "problem": "An industrial chemist is overseeing the hydroformylation, also known as the oxo process, of propene to produce aldehydes. The reaction is catalyzed by a homogeneous catalyst system derived from the precursor tris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium carbonyl hydride, $HRh(CO)(PPh_3)_3$. The primary objective is to maximize the production of the linear aldehyde (butanal, or n-aldehyde) relative to the branched aldehyde (2-methylpropanal, or iso-aldehyde). The catalytic cycle involves equilibria between various 16- and 18-electron rhodium species. The regioselectivity of the reaction—the ratio of n-aldehyde to iso-aldehyde ($n/iso$ ratio)—is highly dependent on the steric and electronic environment around the rhodium center, which is influenced by the concentrations of the ligands, including carbon monoxide (CO) and triphenylphosphine ($PPh_3$).\n\nDuring a production run, a malfunction in a pressure regulator causes the partial pressure of carbon monoxide (CO) in the reactor to increase significantly, while the partial pressure of H₂ and the temperature are held constant. Based on the established mechanism for this catalytic system, which of the following statements best describes the expected impact on the $n/iso$ ratio and provides the correct underlying chemical reason?\n\nA. The $n/iso$ ratio will decrease. This is because the higher CO concentration shifts the catalyst equilibrium towards species with more CO ligands and fewer bulky phosphine ligands (e.g., $HRh(CO)₂(PPh₃)₂$), which are less sterically demanding and thus reduce the selectivity for the linear product.\n\nB. The $n/iso$ ratio will increase. This is because a higher CO concentration enhances the rate of CO migratory insertion, which occurs more readily for the linear rhodium-alkyl intermediate that leads to the n-aldehyde.\n\nC. The $n/iso$ ratio will decrease. This is because excess CO acts as a catalyst poison by forming an inactive rhodium carbonyl cluster, and the formation of the branched aldehyde is kinetically favored under such inhibited conditions.\n\nD. The $n/iso$ ratio will remain unchanged. The regioselectivity is an intrinsic property determined solely by the choice of the phosphine ligand ($PPh_3$) and is not sensitive to the partial pressure of the gaseous reactants like CO.\n\nE. The $n/iso$ ratio will increase. According to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing the concentration of a reactant (CO) will push the reaction towards the products, and the linear aldehyde is the thermodynamically more stable product, thus favoring its formation.", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the effect of an increased partial pressure of carbon monoxide (CO) on the regioselectivity ($n/iso$ ratio) of the rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation of propene.\n\nThe key to understanding the regioselectivity in this system lies in the steric environment of the active rhodium catalyst during the hydride insertion step, which is the regiochemistry-determining step.\n\n1.  **Catalyst Equilibria:** The catalyst precursor, $HRh(CO)(PPh_3)_3$, is an 18-electron complex. To become catalytically active, it must first dissociate a ligand to create a vacant coordination site for the alkene substrate. The most likely ligand to dissociate is one of the bulky triphenylphosphine ($PPh_3$) ligands, denoted as L.\n    $$ HRh(CO)(L)_3 \\rightleftharpoons HRh(CO)(L)_2 + L $$\n    The resulting 16-electron species, $HRh(CO)(L)_2$, is a primary active catalyst. This species exists in equilibrium with other species depending on the concentration of available ligands (CO and L). A key equilibrium involves the reaction with CO:\n    $$ HRh(CO)(L)_2 + CO \\rightleftharpoons HRh(CO)_2(L)_2 $$\n    This equilibrium is governed by the relative partial pressures (concentrations) of CO and the free phosphine ligand L.\n\n2.  **Steric Control of Regioselectivity:** The regioselectivity is determined when the hydride ($H^−$) on the rhodium center migrates to one of the two carbons of the coordinated propene double bond.\n    *   **Path to n-aldehyde (linear):** The hydride adds to the internal carbon (C2) of propene. This forms a linear rhodium-alkyl bond (at C1). This pathway is called anti-Markovnikov addition.\n    *   **Path to iso-aldehyde (branched):** The hydride adds to the terminal carbon (C1) of propene. This forms a branched rhodium-alkyl bond (at C2). This pathway is called Markovnikov addition.\n\n    The choice between these two pathways is dominated by steric interactions between the bulky phosphine ligands (L = $PPh_3$) on the rhodium center and the methyl group of the propene substrate.\n\n3.  **Effect of Low vs. High CO Pressure:**\n    *   **At low CO pressure (or high L concentration):** The equilibrium favors the species $HRh(CO)(L)_2$. This complex contains two large, bulky $PPh_3$ ligands. To minimize steric repulsion with these bulky ligands, the propene substrate orients itself such that the hydride transfer leads to the less sterically hindered linear alkyl intermediate. Therefore, low CO pressure favors the formation of the n-aldehyde, resulting in a **high $n/iso$ ratio**.\n    *   **At high CO pressure (or low L concentration):** As the partial pressure of CO increases, the equilibrium $HRh(CO)(L)_2 + CO \\rightleftharpoons HRh(CO)_2(L)_2$ shifts to the right. The resulting species, $HRh(CO)_2(L)_2$, has more small CO ligands and fewer bulky $PPh_3$ ligands directly influencing the coordination site. For example, in a trigonal bipyramidal structure for $HRh(CO)_2(L)_2$, the two bulky $PPh_3$ ligands can occupy the axial positions, leaving the equatorial plane (where the alkene coordinates and reacts) less sterically crowded. This reduction in steric hindrance at the metal center diminishes the preference for the anti-Markovnikov hydride addition. The formation of the branched (iso) alkyl intermediate becomes more competitive. Consequently, the proportion of iso-aldehyde increases relative to the n-aldehyde, leading to a **decrease in the $n/iso$ ratio**.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A:** This option correctly states that the $n/iso$ ratio will decrease and provides the correct reason: the catalyst equilibrium shifts towards less sterically hindered dicarbonyl species, which reduces the steric bias that favors the linear product. This is the correct answer.\n    *   **B:** This option is incorrect. The migratory insertion of CO occurs *after* the hydride insertion step has already determined the regiochemistry (linear vs. branched alkyl). Its rate does not influence the $n/iso$ ratio.\n    *   **C:** While it's true that very high CO pressures can inhibit or poison the catalyst, this is not the primary mechanism governing the change in *selectivity*. The change in selectivity is a more subtle effect related to the equilibrium between active species, as described in A.\n    *   **D:** This is incorrect. While the ligand's intrinsic properties are crucial, the *concentration* of ligands (both $PPh_3$ and CO) determines the composition of the active catalyst species in the equilibrium mixture and thereby its effective steric bulk and selectivity.\n    *   **E:** This is a misapplication of Le Chatelier's principle. The principle describes the response of an equilibrium to a change in conditions, but it doesn't directly predict the outcome of competing kinetic pathways (selectivity) in a complex catalytic cycle. The relative stability of the final products does not dictate the kinetically controlled regioselectivity.\n\nTherefore, the increase in CO pressure leads to a less sterically demanding catalytic environment, which in turn lowers the selectivity for the linear aldehyde, causing the $n/iso$ ratio to decrease.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2259027"}]}
