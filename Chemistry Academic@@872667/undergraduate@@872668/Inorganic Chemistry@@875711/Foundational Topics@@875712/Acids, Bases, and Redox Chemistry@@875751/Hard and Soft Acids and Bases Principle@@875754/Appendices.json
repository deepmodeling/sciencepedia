This exercise provides a classic metathesis reaction and asks you to determine the position of the equilibrium. By classifying each ion as a hard or soft acid/base, you can predict whether the reaction favors the products or reactants based on the stability gained from forming matched hard-hard and soft-soft pairs [@problem_id:2256924].", "problem": "Consider the following metathesis reaction in a non-coordinating solvent:\n$$HgF_2 + BeI_2 \\rightleftharpoons HgI_2 + BeF_2$$\nThe Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) principle is a qualitative concept used to explain the stability of compounds, reactions, and reaction mechanisms. It states that, as a general rule, hard acids prefer to form stable bonds with hard bases, and soft acids prefer to form stable bonds with soft bases. A \"hard\" species is typically small, has a high charge state, and is not very polarizable. A \"soft\" species is typically large, has a low charge state, and is highly polarizable.\n\nBased on an analysis using the HSAB principle, what is the expected outcome for the equilibrium position of this reaction?\n\nA. The equilibrium will strongly favor the reactants ($HgF_2$ and $BeI_2$).\n\nB. The equilibrium will strongly favor the products ($HgI_2$ and $BeF_2$).\n\nC. The equilibrium position will be approximately in the middle, with significant concentrations of all four species, as the stabilities of the reactant and product pairs are comparable.\n\nD. The reaction will favor the formation of the compound with the largest difference in electronegativity between the cation and anion, which is $BeF_2$, thus driving the reaction to the right.\n\nE.

The specification of a non-coordinating solvent minimizes complicating solvation or coordination effects, so the HSAB prediction is expected to govern the equilibrium position.\n\nHence, the equilibrium will strongly favor the products $HgI_{2}$ and $BeF_{2}$.\n\nThis corresponds to option B; options A and C contradict HSAB, option D incorrectly invokes electronegativity difference as the decisive criterion, and option E is incorrect because HSAB does provide a qualitative prediction here.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2256924"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple predictions, HSAB is a powerful tool for designing practical laboratory procedures like selective precipitation. This problem presents a scenario where you must separate two different metal ions, a hard acid ($Mg^{2+}$) and a borderline acid ($Zn^{2+}$), using a soft base ($S^{2-}$). Your task is to use HSAB to predict which metal sulfide will preferentially precipitate, a key skill in analytical chemistry and hydrometallurgy [@problem_id:2256908].", "problem": "A chemist is working on a selective precipitation method for a wastewater stream containing equimolar concentrations of magnesium ions ($Mg^{2+}$) and zinc ions ($Zn^{2+}$). For the purposes of applying qualitative chemical principles, $Mg^{2+}$ is classified as a hard Lewis acid and $Zn^{2+}$ is classified as a borderline Lewis acid. A small, stoichiometrically limited amount of a solution of sodium sulfide ($Na_2S$) is slowly added, which introduces the sulfide ion ($S^{2-}$) into the system. The sulfide ion is a soft Lewis base. Based on the principles governing acid-base interactions, predict which of the following compounds will be the major solid product that preferentially forms.\n\nA. $ZnS$\n\nB. $MgS$\n\nC. $MgO$\n\nD. $Zn(OH)_2$\n\nE. No precipitate will form as both potential sulfide products are readily soluble in water.", "solution": "We apply the hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) principle: hard acids preferentially bind hard bases, soft acids preferentially bind soft bases, and borderline acids prefer softer donors over hard ones. The ions are classified as follows: $Mg^{2+}$ is a hard Lewis acid, $Zn^{2+}$ is a borderline Lewis acid, and $S^{2-}$ is a soft Lewis base.\n\nSulfide precipitates form via:\n$$\nM^{2+} + S^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons MS(s),\n$$\nwith precipitation governed by the solubility product condition. For each metal $M \\in \\{Mg, Zn\\}$, precipitation occurs when the ionic product exceeds the solubility product:\n$$\nQ_{sp,M} = [M^{2+}][S^{2-}] > K_{sp,MS}.\n$$\nLet the initial, equimolar concentrations of $Mg^{2+}$ and $Zn^{2+}$ be $c$. As $S^{2-}$ is slowly added, the threshold sulfide concentration needed to begin precipitation of each sulfide is\n$$\n[S^{2-}]_{\\text{crit},ZnS} = \\frac{K_{sp,ZnS}}{c}, \\quad [S^{2-}]_{\\text{crit},MgS} = \\frac{K_{sp,MgS}}{c}.\n$$\nBy HSAB considerations, the interaction of a soft base $S^{2-}$ with a borderline acid $Zn^{2+}$ is significantly stronger than with a hard acid $Mg^{2+}$. This greater affinity corresponds to a more stable lattice and a much smaller solubility product:\n$$\nK_{sp,ZnS} \\ll K_{sp,MgS} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad [S^{2-}]_{\\text{crit},ZnS} \\ll [S^{2-}]_{\\text{crit},MgS}.\n$$\nTherefore, as $S^{2-}$ is introduced, $ZnS$ reaches its precipitation threshold first. Once $ZnS$ begins to precipitate, it removes $Zn^{2+}$ and $S^{2-}$ from solution, buffering $[S^{2-}]$ near the solubility limit for $ZnS$ and preventing $[S^{2-}]$ from rising to the higher threshold required to precipitate $MgS$. Because the amount of $S^{2-}$ added is stoichiometrically limited, $[S^{2-}]$ remains insufficient to trigger $MgS$ precipitation, making $ZnS$ the major solid product.\n\nCompeting hydroxide formation can be assessed qualitatively. Sulfide hydrolyzes:\n$$\nS^{2-} + H_{2}O \\rightleftharpoons HS^{-} + OH^{-}, \\quad HS^{-} + H_{2}O \\rightleftharpoons H_{2}S + OH^{-},\n$$\nwhich can raise $[OH^{-}]$ and potentially precipitate hydroxides. However, HSAB indicates $Zn^{2+}$ prefers the softer base $S^{2-}$ over the harder base $OH^{-}$, and the sulfide $ZnS$ is thermodynamically more stable (much smaller $K_{sp}$) than $Zn(OH)_{2}$, so $ZnS$ forms preferentially over $Zn(OH)_{2}$. The option $MgO$ does not form directly from aqueous solution under these conditions, and $MgS$ is disfavored both by HSAB considerations and by its greater propensity to hydrolyze rather than remain as a stable sulfide in water. The statement that both sulfides are readily soluble is false, as $ZnS$ is highly insoluble.\n\nTherefore, the major solid product that preferentially forms is $ZnS$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2256908"}, {"introduction": "The HSAB principle finds extensive use in coordination chemistry, particularly for predicting how a ligand binds to a metal center. This practice focuses on the ambidentate ligand thiocyanate ($SCN^−$), which can coordinate through either its nitrogen or sulfur atom.
