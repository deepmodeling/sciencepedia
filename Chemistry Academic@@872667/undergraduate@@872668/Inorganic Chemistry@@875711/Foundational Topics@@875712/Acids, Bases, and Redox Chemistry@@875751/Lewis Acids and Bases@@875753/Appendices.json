This practice solidifies the fundamental principle by examining a ubiquitous chemical process: the hydration of a metal ion in water. By identifying the electron-pair donor and acceptor in this interaction, you will learn to recognize Lewis acid-base behavior in contexts central to aqueous and coordination chemistry [@problem_id:2002561].", "problem": "When an ionic salt such as magnesium chloride, $MgCl_2$, is dissolved in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions. The resulting cations and anions become surrounded by water molecules in a process called hydration. Consider the very first step of this process for a single magnesium ion, $Mg^{2+}$, where it interacts with a single water molecule, $H_2O$, to form a hydrated complex, $[Mg(H_2O)]^{2+}$.\n\nBased on the nature of this interaction and the definitions of acid-base theories, which of the following statements accurately describes the roles of the magnesium ion and the water molecule?\n\nA. The $Mg^{2+}$ ion acts as a Lewis acid, and the water molecule acts as a Lewis base.\n\nB. The water molecule acts as a Lewis acid, and the $Mg^{2+}$ ion acts as a Lewis base.\n\nC. The $Mg^{2+}$ ion acts as a Brønsted-Lowry acid, and the water molecule acts as a Brønsted-Lowry base.\n\nD. This interaction is a redox reaction, not an acid-base reaction.\n\nE. Both the $Mg^{2+}$ ion and the water molecule act as Lewis bases.", "solution": "To determine the correct description of the interaction between a magnesium ion ($Mg^{2+}$) and a water molecule ($H_2O$), we must first recall the relevant acid-base definitions and analyze the electronic structures of the species involved.\n\nThe Lewis theory of acids and bases defines a Lewis acid as a species that can accept an electron pair, and a Lewis base as a species that can donate an electron pair. An acid-base reaction in this context involves the formation of a coordinate covalent bond, where one species provides both electrons for the bond.\n\nLet's analyze the magnesium ion, $Mg^{2+}$. A neutral magnesium atom has the electron configuration $[Ne]3s^2$. To form the $Mg^{2+}$ cation, it loses the two valence electrons from the 3s orbital. This leaves the ion with a complete octet in the second shell, but more importantly, it results in vacant valence orbitals (the 3s and 3p orbitals). The positive charge and the presence of these empty, low-energy orbitals make the $Mg^{2+}$ ion an excellent candidate for accepting a pair of electrons. Therefore, $Mg^{2+}$ can act as a Lewis acid.\n\nNext, let's analyze the water molecule, $H_2O$. The central oxygen atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The Lewis structure of water shows that the oxygen atom has two lone pairs of non-bonding electrons in its valence shell. These lone pairs are not involved in bonding with the hydrogen atoms and are available for donation to an electron-deficient species. Therefore, a water molecule can act as a Lewis base.\n\nIn the hydration process, a water molecule approaches the $Mg^{2+}$ ion. The oxygen atom of the water molecule donates one of its lone pairs of electrons to an empty valence orbital of the $Mg^{2+}$ ion. This forms a coordinate covalent bond between the oxygen and the magnesium, resulting in the hydrated complex $[Mg(H_2O)]^{2+}$.\n\nSince the $Mg^{2+}$ ion accepts an electron pair, it is the Lewis acid. Since the $H_2O$ molecule donates an electron pair, it is the Lewis base. This confirms that statement A is correct.\n\nNow let's evaluate the other options to ensure they are incorrect.\n- Option B is the reverse of the correct assignment and is therefore incorrect. The $Mg^{2+}$ ion is electron-deficient and accepts electrons; it does not have lone pairs to donate. Water donates an electron pair, it does not accept one in this interaction.\n- Option C uses the Brønsted-Lowry definitions. A Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton ($H^+$) donor, and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor. In the formation of the initial complex, $[Mg(H_2O)]^{2+}$, there is no transfer of a proton from one species to another. The water molecule remains intact. Thus, the Brønsted-Lowry definitions are not applicable to describe this specific coordination step.\n- Option D suggests a redox reaction. Redox reactions involve a change in the oxidation states of the atoms. In this reaction, the oxidation state of magnesium is +2 on both the reactant ($Mg^{2+}$) and product ($[Mg(H_2O)]^{2+}$) side. Similarly, the oxidation states of oxygen (-2) and hydrogen (+1) in the water molecule do not change upon forming the complex. Since there is no change in oxidation states, this is not a redox reaction.\n- Option E claims both are Lewis bases. A reaction requires both an electron pair donor (base) and an acceptor (acid). It's not possible for two Lewis bases to react in this manner.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the only correct description is that the magnesium ion is a Lewis acid and the water molecule is a Lewis base.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2002561"}, {"introduction": "The formation of a Lewis acid-base adduct is more than just an electronic rearrangement; it leads to a tangible change in the molecule's three-dimensional structure.

We will use the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory to predict the geometries of the reactant ($AlCl_3$) and the product ($[AlCl_4]^-$).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the Lewis acid, aluminum trichloride ($AlCl_3$).\nThe central atom is aluminum (Al), which is in Group 13 of the periodic table and has 3 valence electrons. It forms single bonds with three chlorine (Cl) atoms. The Lewis structure shows Al as the central atom bonded to three Cl atoms. The total number of electron domains around the central Al atom is the sum of bonding pairs and lone pairs. In $AlCl_3$, Al forms 3 single bonds, so there are 3 bonding pairs. To check for lone pairs on Al, we count the electrons around it: 3 valence electrons from Al plus 1 electron from each of the 3 Cl atoms for the covalent bonds, totaling $3 + 3 = 6$ electrons. This corresponds to 3 bonding pairs. Since Al has 3 valence electrons and all are used in bonding, there are 0 lone pairs on the central aluminum atom.\nAccording to VSEPR theory, a central atom with 3 electron domains and 0 lone pairs will have a trigonal planar electronic geometry and a trigonal planar molecular geometry. The bond angles are $120^\\circ$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the product, the tetrachloroaluminate(III) anion ($[AlCl_4]^-$).\nIn this ion, the central atom is still aluminum. It is now bonded to four chlorine atoms. The reaction involves the chloride ion ($Cl^-$), a Lewis base, donating a pair of electrons to the electron-deficient aluminum atom in $AlCl_3$, the Lewis acid, to form a new coordinate covalent bond. The central Al atom is now surrounded by 4 bonding pairs (one for each Al-Cl bond). There are still no lone pairs on the central aluminum atom as its original 3 valence electrons plus the donated pair from $Cl^-$ are all involved in bonding.\nAccording to VSEPR theory, a central atom with 4 electron domains and 0 lone pairs will have a tetrahedral electronic geometry and a tetrahedral molecular geometry. The bond angles are approximately $109.5^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the molecular geometry around the central aluminum atom changes from trigonal planar in $AlCl_3$ to tetrahedral in $[AlCl_4]^-$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\nA. The molecular geometry around the aluminum atom changes from trigonal pyramidal to tetrahedral. This is incorrect. The initial geometry of $AlCl_3$ is trigonal planar, not trigonal pyramidal. Trigonal pyramidal geometry occurs with 3 bonding pairs and 1 lone pair.\nB. The molecular geometry around the aluminum atom changes from tetrahedral to trigonal planar. This is incorrect. It describes the reverse of the actual transformation.\nC. The molecular geometry around the aluminum atom changes from trigonal planar to tetrahedral. This is correct, as determined by our VSEPR analysis.\nD. The molecular geometry around the aluminum atom changes from linear to trigonal pyramidal. This is incorrect. Neither the initial nor final geometry is described correctly.\nE. The molecular geometry around the aluminum atom does not change; it remains tetrahedral throughout the reaction. This is incorrect. The geometry changes significantly.\n\nThe correct statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2264623"}, {"introduction": "When a Lewis base possesses multiple potential donor atoms, how do we predict where a Lewis acid will bind?
