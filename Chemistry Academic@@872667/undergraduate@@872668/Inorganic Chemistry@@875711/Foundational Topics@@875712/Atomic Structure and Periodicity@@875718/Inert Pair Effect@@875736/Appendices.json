This first exercise provides a classic case study by comparing the reactivity of antimony (Sb) and bismuth (Bi), two adjacent elements in Group 15. By predicting the products of their reactions with a strong oxidizing agent, you can directly observe how the relative stability of the $+3$ and $+5$ oxidation states shifts down the group [@problem_id:2259990].", "problem": "A chemical researcher is conducting a comparative study on the reactivity of two metallic elements from Group 15 of the periodic table: antimony (Sb) and bismuth (Bi). Two separate, parallel experiments are set up. In the first experiment, a sample of pure metallic antimony is allowed to react with an excess of dry chlorine gas ($\\text{Cl}_2$). In the second experiment, a sample of pure metallic bismuth is treated under identical conditions, reacting with an excess of dry chlorine gas. In both cases, the reaction is driven to completion to form the thermodynamically most stable chloride product.\n\nBased on the principles of periodic trends, particularly the inert pair effect, which of the following outcomes correctly identifies the primary product formed from antimony and the primary product formed from bismuth, respectively?\n\nA. $\\text{SbCl}_3$ and $\\text{BiCl}_5$\n\nB. $\\text{SbCl}_5$ and $\\text{BiCl}_3$\n\nC. $\\text{SbCl}_3$ and $\\text{BiCl}_3$\n\nD. $\\text{SbCl}_5$ and $\\text{BiCl}_5$\n\nE. $\\text{Sb}_2\\text{Cl}_3$ and $\\text{Bi}_2\\text{Cl}_5$", "solution": "This problem requires an understanding of the periodic trends in oxidation states for p-block elements, specifically the inert pair effect in Group 15. The elements in Group 15, which includes antimony (Sb) and bismuth (Bi), have a valence electron configuration of $ns^2 np^3$. This allows them to exhibit several oxidation states, with +3 (from losing the three p electrons) and +5 (from losing all five valence electrons) being the most common.\n\nThe inert pair effect describes the increasing reluctance of the $ns^2$ valence electrons to be removed or participate in covalent bonding as one moves down a p-block group. This effect becomes significant for heavier elements (periods 5 and 6) due to the poor shielding of the nuclear charge by the intervening d and f orbitals. This poor shielding leads to a higher effective nuclear charge experienced by the $ns^2$ electrons, contracting their orbital and making them more difficult to ionize. Consequently, the lower oxidation state (Group Number - 2) becomes more stable relative to the higher oxidation state (Group Number) for heavier elements.\n\nLet's apply this principle to the two elements in question.\n\n**Antimony (Sb):**\nAntimony is in Period 5 of Group 15. For antimony, the inert pair effect is present but not dominant. While the +3 oxidation state exists (in $\\text{SbCl}_3$), the +5 oxidation state is also readily accessible and stable, especially when reacting with a strong oxidizing agent like chlorine. Given that an excess of chlorine gas is used, the conditions are strongly oxidizing, driving antimony to its highest possible and stable oxidation state. Therefore, antimony will be oxidized to the +5 state.\nThe balanced chemical reaction is:\n$$2 \\text{Sb}(s) + 5 \\text{Cl}_2(g) \\rightarrow 2 \\text{SbCl}_5(s)$$\nThe primary product is antimony(V) chloride, $\\text{SbCl}_5$.\n\n**Bismuth (Bi):**\nBismuth is in Period 6 of Group 15, directly below antimony. For bismuth, the inert pair effect is much more pronounced. The $6s^2$ electrons are held very tightly to the nucleus and are thus \"inert\". As a result, the +3 oxidation state is significantly more stable and common for bismuth than the +5 oxidation state. While bismuth(V) compounds can be synthesized, they are extremely powerful oxidizing agents and are generally unstable. Bismuth(V) chloride ($\\text{BiCl}_5$) is particularly unstable and decomposes even well below room temperature into $\\text{BiCl}_3$ and $\\text{Cl}_2$. Therefore, under the given reaction conditions, the thermodynamically most stable product is bismuth(III) chloride.\nThe balanced chemical reaction is:\n$$2 \\text{Bi}(s) + 3 \\text{Cl}_2(g) \\rightarrow 2 \\text{BiCl}_3(s)$$\nThe primary product is bismuth(III) chloride, $\\text{BiCl}_3$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn summary, the reaction with excess chlorine gas yields antimony(V) chloride ($\\text{SbCl}_5$) for antimony and bismuth(III) chloride ($\\text{BiCl}_3$) for bismuth.

This problem challenges you to determine the true structure of a compound with the empirical formula $\\text{TlI}_3$, which is not as straightforward as it seems.

They attempt to synthesize thallium(III) iodide by reacting an aqueous solution of a thallium(III) salt with an excess of potassium iodide solution. The resulting precipitate has the empirical formula $\\text{TlI}_3$. However, based on chemical principles, there are two plausible structural formulations for this compound:\n\n1.  A simple ionic salt, thallium(III) iodide, containing the thallium(III) cation and three separate iodide anions, represented as $\\text{Tl}^{3+}(\\text{I}^{-})_3$.\n2.  A complex ionic compound, thallium(I) triiodide, containing the thallium(I) cation and the linear triiodide anion, represented as $\\text{Tl}^{+}(\\text{I}_3^{-})$.\n\nTo predict the correct structure, consider the following established chemical principles:\n-   **The Inert Pair Effect:** For heavy main-group elements, especially in Groups 13 and 14, the stability of the lower oxidation state (which is two less than the group's maximum oxidation state) increases significantly down the group. For thallium (Tl), this effect is very pronounced, making the +1 oxidation state much more stable than the +3 oxidation state. Consequently, the thallium(III) ion, $\\text{Tl}^{3+}$, is a powerful oxidizing agent.\n-   **Redox Properties of Iodide:** The iodide ion, $\\text{I}^{-}$, is a moderate reducing agent, capable of being oxidized to elemental iodine, $\\text{I}_2$. In the presence of excess iodide ions, any iodine formed will readily combine with an iodide ion to form the stable triiodide ion, $\\text{I}_3^{-}$.\n\nBased on a careful consideration of these principles, which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the compound with the formula $\\text{TlI}_3$?\n\nA. The compound is $\\text{Tl}^{3+}(\\text{I}^{-})_3$, as the +3 charge of the single thallium cation must be balanced by the charge of three separate iodide anions.\n\nB. The compound is $\\text{Tl}^{+}(\\text{I}_3^{-})$, because the strong oxidizing nature of the $\\text{Tl}^{3+}$ ion causes it to be reduced to the more stable $\\text{Tl}^{+}$ ion by oxidizing iodide ions to form the triiodide complex anion.\n\nC. The compound is $\\text{Tl}^{3+}(\\text{I}^{-})_3$, because as a Group 13 element, thallium is expected to be most stable in its group oxidation state of +3, similar to aluminum.\n\nD. The compound is $\\text{Tl}^{+}(\\text{I}_3^{-})$, which forms because the exceptional stability of the triiodide anion is the primary driving force, even though $\\text{Tl}^{3+}$ is generally the more stable oxidation state for thallium.\n\nE.

The key chemical principles to apply are the inert pair effect and the redox behavior of $\\text{I}^{-}$.\n\nBy the inert pair effect, the lower oxidation state is stabilized in heavy p-block elements. For thallium, the $+1$ oxidation state is significantly more stable than $+3$, making $\\text{Tl}^{3+}$ a strong oxidizing agent. Iodide, $\\text{I}^{-}$, is a reducing agent that can be oxidized to $\\text{I}_{2}$.
