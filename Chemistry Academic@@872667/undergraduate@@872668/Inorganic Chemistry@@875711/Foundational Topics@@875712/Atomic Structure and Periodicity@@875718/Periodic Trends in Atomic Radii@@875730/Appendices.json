The potassium ion ($K^+$) is larger than the chloride ion ($Cl^-$) because cations are generally larger than anions.", "solution": "The problem asks us to compare the ionic radii of two isoelectronic ions, $K^+$ and $Cl^-$, and to identify the correct reasoning for the difference in their sizes.\n\nStep 1: Understand the term \"isoelectronic\".\nIsoelectronic species are atoms or ions that have the same number of electrons and, as a result, the same ground-state electron configuration. Let's verify this for the given ions.\n- A neutral potassium atom (K) has an atomic number of 19, meaning it has 19 protons and 19 electrons. To form the cation $K^+$, it loses one electron. Therefore, $K^+$ has 19 protons and $19 - 1 = 18$ electrons.\n- A neutral chlorine atom (Cl) has an atomic number of 17, meaning it has 17 protons and 17 electrons. To form the anion $Cl^-$, it gains one electron. Therefore, $Cl^-$ has 17 protons and $17 + 1 = 18$ electrons.\nBoth $K^+$ and $Cl^-$ have 18 electrons, confirming they are an isoelectronic pair. Their electron configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6$, which is the same as the noble gas Argon.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the factors determining ionic radius.\nThe radius of an atom or ion is determined by the balance between the attractive force of the positively charged nucleus on the negatively charged electrons and the repulsive forces among the electrons themselves. For an isoelectronic series, the number of electrons is constant. This means that the effects of electron-electron repulsion and shielding by inner-shell electrons are roughly similar across the series. The dominant factor that changes is the nuclear charge, which is the number of protons in the nucleus.\n\nStep 3: Compare the nuclear charges of $K^+$ and $Cl^-$.\n- The potassium ion ($K^+$) has 19 protons in its nucleus.\n- The chloride ion ($Cl^-$) has 17 protons in its nucleus.\n\nStep 4: Relate nuclear charge to ionic radius.\nThe nucleus of the potassium ion ($K^+$) has a charge of $+19$, while the nucleus of the chloride ion ($Cl^-$) has a charge of $+17$. Both of these nuclei are attracting the same number of electrons (18). The greater positive charge of the $K^+$ nucleus exerts a stronger electrostatic pull on its 18 electrons compared to the pull exerted by the $Cl^-$ nucleus. This stronger attraction pulls the electron cloud in $K^+$ closer to the nucleus, resulting in a smaller ionic radius. Conversely, the weaker pull from the 17 protons in $Cl^-$ on its 18 electrons allows the electron cloud to be less tightly bound and occupy a larger volume. Therefore, the ionic radius of $Cl^-$ is larger than that of $K^+$. This concept is often described in terms of effective nuclear charge ($Z_{eff}$); for an isoelectronic series, the species with more protons has a higher $Z_{eff}$ and is smaller.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. The chloride ion ($Cl^-$) is larger than the potassium ion ($K^+$) because it has fewer protons, resulting in a weaker effective nuclear charge pulling on the electron cloud. This matches our reasoning perfectly.\n- B. The potassium ion ($K^+$) is larger than the chloride ion ($Cl^-$) because the parent atom, potassium, is in a higher period. This reasoning is flawed. While K is larger than Cl as neutral atoms, this trend does not directly apply to their ions in an isoelectronic series, where nuclear charge is the dominant factor.\n- C. The potassium ion ($K^+$) and the chloride ion ($Cl^-$) have identical radii because they are isoelectronic. This is incorrect. Being isoelectronic does not guarantee identical radii because the nuclear charges are different.\n- D. The chloride ion ($Cl^-$) is larger than the potassium ion ($K^+$) because as a halogen, its atoms naturally have a larger radius than alkali metals. This statement about neutral atoms is incorrect; alkali metals (left side of a period) are larger than halogens (right side of the same period).\n- E. The potassium ion ($K^+$) is larger than the chloride ion ($Cl^-$) because cations are generally larger than anions. This is a false statement. Cations are smaller than their parent atoms, and anions are larger than their parent atoms. There is no general rule that cations are larger than anions.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only statement that correctly identifies the larger ion and provides the correct physical reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2278484"}, {"introduction": "While general periodic trends, like the increase in atomic radius down a group, provide a solid foundation, the real world of chemistry is filled with fascinating exceptions that reveal deeper principles. The elements in Group 9 present one such case, where the radius barely increases from rhodium ($Rh$) to iridium ($Ir$). This exercise [@problem_id:2010339] will guide you to uncover the reason for this anomaly, introducing you to the concept of the lanthanide contraction and the crucial role that inner-shell electron shielding plays in determining atomic size for heavier elements.", "problem": "In general chemistry, a fundamental periodic trend is that atomic radius tends to increase down a group in the periodic table. This is primarily attributed to the addition of a new principal electron shell. Consider the elements in Group 9: Cobalt (Co), Rhodium (Rh), and Iridium (Ir). Their experimentally determined covalent radii are approximately:\n\n- Cobalt (Co, Period 4): 125 pm\n- Rhodium (Rh, Period 5): 134 pm\n- Iridium (Ir, Period 6): 136 pm\n\nAs you can see, the increase in radius from Co to Rh (9 pm) is substantial, following the expected trend. However, the increase from Rh to Ir (2 pm) is almost negligible.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for why the atomic radius of Iridium is unexpectedly similar to that of Rhodium?\n\nA. Relativistic effects in the heavy Iridium atom cause its inner s-orbitals to contract, which subsequently pulls the outer valence orbitals closer to the nucleus, counteracting the size increase from an additional shell.\n\nB. After Rhodium, the filled 3d and 4d subshells in Iridium exhibit exceptionally strong shielding of the nuclear charge, leading to a weaker effective pull on the valence electrons.\n\nC. The filling of the 4f orbital for the elements preceding Iridium introduces 14 protons to the nucleus, but the 4f electrons are very poor at shielding the outer electrons, resulting in a large increase in effective nuclear charge that contracts the atom's size.\n\nD. Rhodium possesses an anomalously large atomic radius for its period due to exceptionally strong electron-electron repulsion in its valence d-orbitals, making the subsequent size increase to Iridium appear smaller than it truly is.\n\nE. The high electronegativity of Iridium compared to Rhodium causes a stronger attraction for bonding electrons in the solid state from which the covalent radius is measured, leading to an artificially smaller measured radius.", "solution": "We begin from the general quantum-mechanical trend that orbital radial extent depends on both the principal quantum number and the effective nuclear charge. In a hydrogenic model, the characteristic radius scales as\n$$\nr \\propto \\frac{n^{2}}{Z_{\\text{eff}}},\n$$\nand in multi-electron atoms this scaling remains qualitatively valid: for a given shell and subshell, increasing $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ contracts orbital size, while increasing $n$ expands it.\n\nDown a group, adding a new principal shell from $n$ to $n+1$ tends to increase $r$. Thus, from Rh ($4d$ in period 5) to Ir ($5d$ in period 6), the added shell would ordinarily increase the covalent radius.\n\nHowever, the effective nuclear charge is $Z_{\\text{eff}} = Z - \\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ denotes the shielding constant. The elements immediately preceding the $5d$ transition series (which includes Ir) are the lanthanides, where the $4f$ subshell is being filled. The $4f$ electrons are spatially contracted and shield the nucleus poorly for electrons in outer $5d$ and $6s$ orbitals. As $Z$ increases substantially across the lanthanide series, the poor $4f$ shielding fails to compensate, so $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ for the outer orbitals of the subsequent $5d$ transition metals becomes significantly larger than would be expected if shielding were efficient. This increase in $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ contracts the $5d$ and $6s$ orbital sizes, offsetting the radial increase that would arise solely from the higher principal quantum number.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as the lanthanide contraction and is the standard explanation for why $5d$ transition metals (e.g., Ir) have radii very similar to their $4d$ congeners (e.g., Rh). Therefore, the small difference between the covalent radii of Rh and Ir is most accurately and fundamentally explained by poor $4f$ shielding increasing $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and contracting the atom.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A mentions relativistic contraction of inner $s$ orbitals. While relativistic effects do contribute for very heavy elements, the canonical, primary explanation for the near parity of $4d$ and $5d$ radii across the series is the lanthanide contraction due to poor $4f$ shielding, not inner $s$ contraction alone.\n- B claims exceptionally strong shielding by filled $3d$ and $4d$, which would decrease $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and increase radius—the wrong direction.\n- C correctly identifies the poor shielding of $4f$ electrons, the associated increase in $Z_{\\text{eff}}$, and the resulting contraction—this is the standard and most fundamental explanation.\n- D attributes the observation to an anomalously large Rh radius from $d$-$d$ repulsions, which is not supported as a general cause across the series.\n- E invokes a measurement artifact via electronegativity, which is neither fundamental nor consistent with how covalent radii are determined across many compounds.\n\nThus, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is the poor shielding by $4f$ electrons preceding Ir, i.e., the lanthanide contraction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2010339"}, {"introduction": "The concepts of effective nuclear charge and electron shielding are not just abstract ideas; they form the basis of quantitative models that can predict real-world chemical properties.
