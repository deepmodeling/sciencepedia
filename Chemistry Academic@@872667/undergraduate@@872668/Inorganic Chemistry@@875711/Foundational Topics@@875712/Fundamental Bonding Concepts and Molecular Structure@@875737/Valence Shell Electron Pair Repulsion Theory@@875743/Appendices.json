Count valence electrons to determine the likely bonding and lone-pair arrangement. Sulfur contributes $6$ valence electrons, oxygen contributes $6$, and each chlorine contributes $7$, giving a total of $6+6+2\\times 7=26$ valence electrons for the molecule.\n\nA structure that satisfies octets and minimizes formal charges places sulfur at the center with a double bond to oxygen and single bonds to two chlorine atoms, leaving one lone pair on sulfur. Formal charges confirm this:\n- On sulfur: $\\text{FC}(S)=6-\\left(2+\\frac{8}{2}\\right)=6-(2+4)=0$,\n- On oxygen: $\\text{FC}(O)=6-\\left(4+\\frac{4}{2}\\right)=6-(4+2)=0$,\n- On each chlorine: $\\text{FC}(Cl)=7-\\left(6+\\frac{2}{2}\\right)=7-(6+1)=0$.\n\nThus, around the central sulfur, there are four regions of electron density: one $S{= }O$ double bond, two $S{-}Cl$ single bonds, and one lone pair. By VSEPR theory, four electron domains correspond to a tetrahedral electron-domain geometry.\n\nThe molecular geometry (the arrangement of atoms, ignoring lone pairs) for an $\\text{AX}_{3}\\text{E}$ set is trigonal pyramidal. Although bond angles deviate from the ideal tetrahedral value due to the lone pair and the $S{= }O$ double bond, the correct geometry classification remains trigonal pyramidal.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the molecular geometry of $SOCl_{2}$ is trigonal pyramidal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2298020"}, {"introduction": "VSEPR theory does more than just assign basic geometric labels; it explains the subtle variations in bond angles between related molecules.
