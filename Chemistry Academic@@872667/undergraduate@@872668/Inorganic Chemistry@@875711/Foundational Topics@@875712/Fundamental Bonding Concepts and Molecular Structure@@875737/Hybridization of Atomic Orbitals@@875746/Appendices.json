The central carbon atom has a steric number of 2 (two sigma bonds, zero lone pairs), and is therefore $sp$-hybridized.\n2.  Based on this hybridization, the three-carbon backbone ($C=C=C$) of the molecule must be bent, with a bond angle of approximately $120^\\circ$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the fundamental flaw in the student's reasoning?\n\nA. The central carbon atom in allene is actually $sp^3$ hybridized because it participates in a total of four bonds (two sigma and two pi).\nB. The central carbon atom is $sp^2$ hybridized, not $sp$ hybridized, which is the correct hybridization for an atom forming a double bond and leads to a 120° bond angle.\nC. The student correctly identified the hybridization as $sp$, but an $sp$-hybridized carbon atom must have a linear geometry with a bond angle of 180°, not a bent geometry with a 120° angle.\nD. The student's model is flawed because the steric number is incorrectly calculated; it should be 4 by counting all sigma and pi bonds, implying a tetrahedral geometry.\nE.

Steric number counts only $\\sigma$ bonds and lone pairs.\n- The central carbon forms two $\\sigma$ bonds (one to each terminal carbon) and has zero lone pairs.\n- Therefore, steric number $=2$, implying $sp$ hybridization. This confirms the student’s first statement is correct.\n\n2) Relate hybridization to geometry:\n- An $sp$-hybridized atom has two $sp$ hybrid orbitals oriented linearly to minimize electron repulsion, giving a bond angle of $180^{\\circ}$ between them.\n- The remaining two unhybridized $p$ orbitals on the central carbon are orthogonal and form two $\\pi$ bonds with the terminal carbons, placing the terminal substituent planes perpendicular to each other, but the $C=C=C$ backbone remains linear.\n\n3) Evaluate the student’s second statement:\n- The claim that $sp$ hybridization leads to a bent geometry with approximately $120^{\\circ}$ is incorrect. A $120^{\\circ}$ bond angle corresponds to $sp^{2}$ (trigonal planar), not $sp$.\n- Hence, the flaw is not in the hybridization assignment but in the inferred geometry; $sp$ hybridization mandates a linear $C-C-C$ angle of $180^{\\circ}$.\n\n4) Assess the options:\n- A is false: the central carbon is not $sp^{3}$; $\\pi$ bonds do not increase the steric number and do not require $sp^{3}$ hybridization.\n- B is false: the central carbon is not $sp^{2}$; steric number is 2, not 3.\n- C is correct: the hybridization $sp$ was correctly identified, but $sp$ implies linear geometry ($180^{\\circ}$), not bent ($120^{\\circ}$).\n- D is false: steric number does not count $\\pi$ bonds; it remains 2, not 4.\n- E is false: the terminal carbons are $sp^{2}$ (each has three electron domains), not $sp$, and they do not force a bent central geometry.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental flaw is the incorrect association of $sp$ hybridization with a $120^{\\circ}$ bent geometry; it should be linear with $180^{\\circ}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2175166"}, {"introduction": "Beyond analyzing existing structures, chemists use principles like hybridization to design new molecules with specific properties and functions.
