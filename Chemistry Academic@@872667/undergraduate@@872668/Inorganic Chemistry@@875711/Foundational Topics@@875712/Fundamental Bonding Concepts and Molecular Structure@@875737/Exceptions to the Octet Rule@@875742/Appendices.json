The molecule is best described by a single Lewis structure with alternating B-N single bonds in the ring.

Consider first the all-single-bond framework in the ring. This uses $6$ B–N bonds and $6$ X–H bonds, totaling $12$ bonds or $24$ electrons, leaving $30 - 24 = 6$ electrons to place as lone pairs. Placing one lone pair on each N accounts for the remaining $6$ electrons.\n\nCompute formal charges using the standard formula $\\text{FC} = V - (L + B/2)$, where $V$ is valence electrons, $L$ is nonbonding (lone pair) electrons, and $B$ is bonding electrons.\nFor N in this structure: $V=5$, $L=2$, $B=6$.

Octet check: each B and N is surrounded by $4$ shared pairs, i.e., $8$ electrons; all octets are satisfied.\n\nThere are two equivalent ways to arrange the three alternating B=N double bonds around the ring, related by a cyclic bond shift (analogous to the two Kekule structures of benzene).
