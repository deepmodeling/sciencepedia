Simply grouping chemicals by broad categories like 'acids' can be misleading and hazardous. This exercise challenges you to think like a safety professional by analyzing the multiple, overlapping hazards of common reagents—oxidizers, combustibles, acids, and bases—to devise a safe storage plan [@problem_id:2260940]. Mastering this skill is the first step toward preventing chemical accidents before they happen.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with organizing a chemical storage cabinet. On a single shelf, the student finds three bottles placed next to each other: concentrated nitric acid ($\\text{HNO}_3$), glacial acetic acid ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH}$), and aniline ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{NH}_2$). Recognizing that these chemicals may have reactive incompatibilities, the student decides to segregate them. Based on the fundamental reactive hazards of these substances (oxidizers, reducers, acids, bases, combustibles), determine the most appropriate and safest storage arrangement.\n\nA. Store the two acids (nitric acid and acetic acid) together, and store the aniline separately.\n\nB. Store the two organic compounds (acetic acid and aniline) together, and store the inorganic nitric acid separately.\n\nC. Store the nitric acid and aniline together, as they are both nitrogen-containing compounds, and store the acetic acid separately.\n\nD. Separate each of the three chemicals from each other, placing them in different secondary containment trays or dedicated cabinets according to their specific hazard class.\n\nE. Leave all three chemicals on the same shelf, but ensure there is at least 12 inches of space between each bottle.", "solution": "First, identify the fundamental hazard classes of each chemical. Concentrated nitric acid is a strong inorganic acid and a powerful oxidizer; it vigorously oxidizes organic materials and can drive highly exothermic and potentially violent reactions. Glacial acetic acid is an organic acid; it is combustible and, as an organic compound, is incompatible with strong oxidizers. Aniline is an aromatic amine; it is a weak organic base and combustible, and it is also incompatible with strong oxidizers and with strong acids due to both redox/nitration hazards and acid-base neutralization.\n\nNext, analyze the incompatibilities pairwise. Nitric acid with acetic acid is an oxidizer-organic pairing; contact or co-spillage can lead to rapid oxidation, heat release, and formation of reactive species (e.g., acetyl nitrate), so they must not be stored together. Nitric acid with aniline is even more hazardous: beyond acid-base neutralization heat, aniline is readily oxidized and can undergo nitration by nitric acid; this pairing is strongly incompatible. Acetic acid with aniline is an acid-base pair and both are combustible organics; while less violent than with nitric acid, acid-base neutralization is still incompatible for storage, and they should be segregated to prevent co-spillage and avoid cross-contamination; furthermore, amines and organic acids are typically stored in separate secondary containment within flammable/combustible storage.\n\nFrom these incompatibilities, derive the appropriate storage scheme based on standard laboratory chemical compatibility guidance. Nitric acid, as an oxidizing mineral acid, should be stored in an oxidizer-compatible, dedicated secondary containment or cabinet, segregated from all organics (both acetic acid and aniline) and from bases. Glacial acetic acid, as a combustible organic acid, should be stored with organic acids or in a flammable/combustible liquids cabinet, segregated from oxidizers and from bases. Aniline, as a combustible organic base (amine), should be stored with organic bases or in a flammable/combustible cabinet, segregated from oxidizers and from acids.\n\nEvaluate the options accordingly. Option A groups nitric acid with acetic acid, which is unsafe due to oxidizer-organic incompatibility. Option B groups acetic acid with aniline, which is unsafe due to acid-base incompatibility. Option C groups nitric acid with aniline, which is highly unsafe due to oxidizer-organic and nitration hazards as well as acid-base neutralization. Option E relies on mere spacing on the same shelf, which does not provide adequate segregation or secondary containment and is not consistent with prudent practices. Option D prescribes full segregation of each according to its hazard class in separate secondary containment or dedicated cabinets, which is the correct and safest arrangement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2260940"}, {"introduction": "While chemists are often focused on chemical reactivity, physical hazards can be just as deadly. So-called 'inert' gases, such as argon and nitrogen, are simple asphyxiants that can displace oxygen in a confined space, leading to suffocation without warning.

This practice highlights the critical importance of understanding the physical properties of chemicals, not just their reactivity.", "problem": "A chemistry researcher is transporting two identical, unsealed 10-liter Dewar flasks through a small, windowless service elevator. One flask contains liquid argon (Ar), and the other contains an equal mass of crushed dry ice (solid carbon dioxide, $\\text{CO}_2$). During transit, the elevator jolts, causing both flasks to tip over and spill their entire contents onto the floor. The liquid argon immediately boils, and the dry ice rapidly sublimates, with both resulting gases quickly reaching thermal equilibrium with the elevator's ambient internal temperature of $298 \\text{ K}$ and pressure of $1.00 \\text{ atm}$.\n\nThese inert gases are simple asphyxiants, meaning they displace oxygen from the air. A gas denser than air will tend to accumulate near the floor, creating a localized, highly oxygen-deficient zone. To quantitatively compare the immediate asphyxiation risk posed by each substance at floor-level, calculate the density of each resulting gas relative to the density of the air in the elevator.\n\nAssume ideal gas behavior for all gases. The necessary molar masses are: $M_{Ar} = 39.95 \\text{ g/mol}$ and $M_{CO_2} = 44.01 \\text{ g/mol}$.

The key physical principle we will use is the ideal gas law, which relates pressure ($P$), volume ($V$), number of moles ($n$), the ideal gas constant ($R$), and temperature ($T$).\n\nThe ideal gas law is given by:\n$$PV = nRT$$\n\nThe density ($\\rho$) of a substance is defined as its mass ($m$) per unit volume ($V$):\n$$\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}$$\n\nWe can express the number of moles ($n$) in terms of the mass ($m$) and the molar mass ($M$) of the substance:\n$$n = \\frac{m}{M}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $n$ into the ideal gas law:\n$$PV = \\left(\\frac{m}{M}\\right)RT$$\n\nTo find an expression for density, we can rearrange this equation to isolate the term $m/V$:\n$$\\frac{m}{V} = \\frac{PM}{RT}$$\nSince $\\rho = m/V$, we have a direct relationship for the density of an ideal gas:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{PM}{RT}$$\n\nThis equation shows that at a constant pressure ($P$) and temperature ($T$), the density of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its molar mass ($M$). The problem states that both resulting gases (Ar and $\\text{CO}_2$) and the air are at the same temperature and pressure inside the elevator.\n\nWe need to calculate two ratios: $\\rho_{Ar} / \\rho_{air}$ and $\\rho_{CO_2} / \\rho_{air}$.\n\nLet's first find the expression for the ratio $\\rho_{Ar} / \\rho_{air}$.\n$$\\frac{\\rho_{Ar}}{\\rho_{air}} = \\frac{\\frac{P M_{Ar}}{RT}}{\\frac{P M_{air}}{RT}}$$\nThe terms $P$, $R$, and $T$ are common to both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out:\n$$\\frac{\\rho_{Ar}}{\\rho_{air}} = \\frac{M_{Ar}}{M_{air}}$$\n\nSimilarly, for the ratio $\\rho_{CO_2} / \\rho_{air}$:\n$$\\frac{\\rho_{CO_2}}{\\rho_{air}} = \\frac{\\frac{P M_{CO_2}}{RT}}{\\frac{P M_{air}}{RT}} = \\frac{M_{CO_2}}{M_{air}}$$\n\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values for the molar masses.\nGiven values:\n$M_{Ar} = 39.95 \\text{ g/mol}$\n$M_{CO_2} = 44.01 \\text{ g/mol}$\n$M_{air} = 28.97 \\text{ g/mol}$\n\nFor the argon to air density ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\rho_{Ar}}{\\rho_{air}} = \\frac{39.95 \\text{ g/mol}}{28.97 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 1.3789...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get 1.38.\n\nFor the carbon dioxide to air density ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\rho_{CO_2}}{\\rho_{air}} = \\frac{44.01 \\text{ g/mol}}{28.97 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 1.5191...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get 1.52.\n\nBoth ratios are greater than 1, indicating that both gases are significantly denser than air and will tend to sink and accumulate at the floor level, displacing oxygen.
