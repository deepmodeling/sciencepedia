The HMBC experiment is designed to show correlations between protons and carbons that are separated by two or three bonds.\n\nFor the purpose of analysis, the pyridine ring carbons are numbered C-2 through C-6, with the nitrogen atom at position 1. The ethyl group is attached at the C-2 position. The carbons of the ethyl group are labeled C-1' for the methylene carbon ($-\\text{CH}_2-$) and C-2' for the terminal methyl carbon ($-\\text{CH}_3$).

One-bond correlations $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ are suppressed in HMBC and are instead observed in HSQC-type experiments.\n\nIn 2-ethylpyridine with the ethyl substituent at C-2, the key connectivities are:\n- H-1' is attached to C-1', and C-1' is directly bonded to the ring carbon C-2.\n- H-2' is attached to C-2', which is bonded to C-1', which is bonded to C-2.\n\nEvaluate each option by counting bonds from the proton to the carbon:\n- Option A: H-1' to C-2. Path: H-1'–C-1' (one bond), C-1'–C-2 (second bond). This is a two-bond correlation, $^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$, which is optimal for HMBC and directly confirms that the methylene is attached to C-2. This is the most structurally diagnostic correlation for the point of attachment.\n- Option B: H-1' to C-1'. Path: H-1'–C-1' (one bond). This is $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$, typically suppressed in HMBC, and not informative for attachment site in this experiment.\n- Option C: H-2' to C-2. Path: H-2'–C-2' (one), C-2'–C-1' (two), C-1'–C-2 (three).

Path: H-1'–C-1' (one), C-1'–C-2 (two), C-2–C-3 (three), C-3–C-4 (four). This is a four-bond pathway, $^{4}J_{\\text{CH}}$, typically weak or absent in standard HMBC and not reliable for assignment.\n\nTherefore, the most significant and structurally informative HMBC correlation confirming attachment at C-2 is the $^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$ correlation between H-1' and C-2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2150832"}, {"introduction": "Often, a $^{1}$H NMR spectrum contains multiple signals that are chemically similar, making their individual assignment difficult. This exercise demonstrates how HMBC resolves such ambiguity by leveraging differences in connectivity over two or three bonds. You will see how a unique functional group, like a carbonyl, can serve as an anchor point, allowing you to distinguish between otherwise similar methyl groups based on which one is close enough to show an HMBC correlation [@problem_id:2150805].", "problem": "An undergraduate student is analyzing the structure of mesityl oxide (4-methyl-3-penten-2-one). The $^{1}$H NMR spectrum of this compound displays three distinct signals in the methyl region, all of which are singlets. The student needs to assign these signals to the corresponding methyl groups in the molecule: the acetyl methyl group (attached to the carbonyl) and the two geminal methyl groups (attached to the C=C double bond).\n\nTo resolve this ambiguity, a Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation (HMBC) spectrum is utilized. The HMBC experiment is designed to show correlations between protons and carbons that are separated by multiple bonds, typically two or three. Which of the following statements accurately describes the key observation involving the carbonyl carbon that would allow for the unambiguous identification of the acetyl methyl group's signal?\n\nA. The acetyl methyl protons show a correlation to the carbonyl carbon, while the protons of the methyl groups on the double bond do not.\n\nB. The protons of the methyl groups on the double bond show a correlation to the carbonyl carbon, while the acetyl methyl protons do not.\n\nC. All three methyl groups show a correlation to the carbonyl carbon.\n\nD. No methyl groups show a correlation to the carbonyl carbon; the assignment must be made by observing a correlation from the vinylic proton instead.\n\nE. Both the acetyl methyl protons and one of the geminal methyl protons show a correlation to the carbonyl carbon, so the assignment remains ambiguous.", "solution": "Identify the relevant structural features: mesityl oxide is $\\text{CH}_3\\text{–CO–CH=C}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$. There are three methyl groups: one acetyl methyl directly attached to the carbonyl ($\\text{CO–CH}_3$) and two geminal methyls attached to the quaternary vinylic carbon of the C=C bond.\n\nRecall the HMBC principle: it shows long-range heteronuclear correlations via $^{n}J_{CH}$ with $n=2$ or $n=3$ predominantly, as stated (“typically two or three”). Four-bond correlations ($n=4$) are generally weak and usually not observed under standard HMBC conditions.\n\nCount the number of bonds from each methyl group’s protons to the carbonyl carbon:\n- For the acetyl methyl ($\\text{CO–CH}_3$): the path H–C(methyl)–C(carbonyl) involves $n=2$ bonds. Therefore, a $^{2}J_{CH}$ correlation to the carbonyl carbon is expected and typically observed in HMBC.\n- For each geminal methyl on the double bond: the path H–C(methyl)–C(vinylic quaternary)–C(vinylic)–C(carbonyl) involves $n=4$ bonds. Therefore, only a $^{4}J_{CH}$ correlation to the carbonyl carbon is possible, which HMBC is not typically set to detect (“typically two or three”). Hence, these correlations are not expected under standard HMBC settings.\n\nTherefore, the key observation that enables unambiguous assignment is that only the acetyl methyl protons show an HMBC cross-peak to the carbonyl carbon, while the two geminal vinylic methyls do not.

This practice challenges you to think like a detective by comparing the expected HMBC correlation patterns for two different constitutional isomers.

The protons belonging to a methyl group show HMBC correlations to only one other carbon center.\n\nC. The protons attached to the carbon bearing the bromine atom show HMBC correlations to two different carbon centers.\n\nD.

Therefore, for any proton set $H$, HMBC cross-peaks appear to those carbon centers $C$ that are separated from $H$ by exactly two or three bonds, provided $^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$ or $^{3}J_{\\text{CH}}$ is nonzero.\n\nLabel the carbon skeletons as follows. For 1-bromopropane $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{Br}$, let $C_1$ denote the terminal methyl carbon, $C_2$ the internal methylene carbon, and $C_3$ the bromomethylene carbon. For 2-bromopropane $(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHBr}$, let $C_c$ denote the central carbon bearing bromine and hydrogen, and let $C_a$ and $C_b$ denote the two methyl carbons, which are magnetically equivalent and give one $^{13}\\text{C}$ resonance.\n\nFor 1-bromopropane:\n- Methyl protons on $C_1$ show $^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$ to $C_2$ and $^{3}J_{\\text{CH}}$ to $C_3$, so they correlate to two distinct carbon centers.\n- Protons on $C_3$ show $^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$ to $C_2$ and $^{3}J_{\\text{CH}}$ to $C_1$, again two distinct carbon centers.\n- A methylene group is present, so methylene protons correlate to the methyl carbon via $^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$.\n\nFor 2-bromopropane:\n- The proton attached to $C_c$ shows $^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$ to $C_a$ and $C_b$, but since $C_a$ and $C_b$ are equivalent, this appears as a single $^{13}\\text{C}$ chemical shift; thus this proton correlates to only one distinct carbon resonance (the methyl carbon).\n- Each methyl group’s protons show $^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$ to $C_c$. A $^{3}J_{\\text{CH}}$ path exists to the other methyl carbon, but because the two methyl carbons are equivalent, the only non-self, non-1-bond distinct carbon center that a methyl group can correlate to is $C_c$. In contrast, in 1-bromopropane the terminal methyl protons must correlate to two different, non-equivalent carbons ($C_2$ and $C_3$).\n- There is no methylene group present, so any HMBC feature requiring methylene protons cannot occur.\n\nEvaluate the options using these rules:\n- A: A methyl–to–brominated carbon correlation can arise via $^{3}J_{\\text{CH}}$ in 1-bromopropane (from $C_1$ H to $C_3$) and via $^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$ in 2-bromopropane (from methyl H to $C_c$), so this observation is not unique to 2-bromopropane.\n- B: If methyl protons show HMBC correlations to only one other carbon center, that matches 2-bromopropane (methyl H correlates uniquely to $C_c$ as the only non-equivalent carbon within two or three bonds), whereas in 1-bromopropane the terminal methyl H must correlate to two different carbons ($C_2$ and $C_3$). This unambiguously supports 2-bromopropane.\n- C: Protons on the brominated carbon showing correlations to two different carbons is characteristic of 1-bromopropane ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{Br}$ H to $C_2$ and $C_1$), not 2-bromopropane (the $\\text{CH–Br}$ H correlates only to the equivalent methyl carbons, appearing as one carbon resonance).\n- D: A methylene–to–methyl correlation requires a methylene group and thus indicates 1-bromopropane; 2-bromopropane has no methylene group.\n\nTherefore, only option B would unambiguously confirm 2-bromopropane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2150824"}]}
