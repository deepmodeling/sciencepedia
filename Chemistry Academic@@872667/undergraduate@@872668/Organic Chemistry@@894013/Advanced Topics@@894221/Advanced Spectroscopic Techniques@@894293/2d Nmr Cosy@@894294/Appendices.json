The spectrum displays two types of signals:\n1.  **Diagonal peaks**: These lie on the diagonal line where F1 = F2. Each diagonal peak corresponds to a signal in the 1D spectrum, appearing at coordinates $(\\delta, \\delta)$.\n2.  **Cross-peaks**: These appear off the diagonal.

This establishes mutual scalar ($J$) coupling between the $\\mathrm{CH_{3}}$ and $\\mathrm{CH_{2}}$ protons.\n\nIn a COSY spectrum, diagonal peaks appear at $(\\delta,\\delta)$ for each signal in the $1\\mathrm{D}$ spectrum, so diagonal peaks are expected at $(1.4,1.4)$ and $(3.5,3.5)$. Cross-peaks appear off the diagonal when two proton sets are scalar coupled.

This exercise challenges you to determine the structure of an unknown ester by integrating multiple pieces of spectroscopic data [@problem_id:2150547].

To elucidate its structure, a 2D Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum was acquired. The analysis of the 1D and 2D spectra revealed the following key pieces of information:\n\n1.  The spectrum contains a singlet signal which appears at a chemical shift of $\\delta = 2.05$ ppm. This singlet shows no cross-peaks to any other signals in the COSY spectrum.\n2.  The COSY spectrum shows at least one cross-peak between a signal that is a triplet and a signal that is a sextet.\n\nBased on this information, determine the structure of the unknown ester from the choices below.\n\nA. Methyl butanoate\n\nB. Propyl acetate\n\nC. Isopropyl acetate\n\nD. Ethyl propanoate\n\nE. tert-Butyl formate", "solution": "First, interpret the singlet at $\\delta=2.05$ ppm that shows no COSY cross-peaks. In a COSY spectrum, cross-peaks arise from scalar-coupled protons. A singlet with no cross-peaks indicates a set of equivalent protons that has no vicinal coupling partners. In esters, the most common such feature near $\\delta\\approx 2.0$ ppm is the acetyl methyl group in an acetate moiety, $-\\mathrm{COCH_3}$, which appears as a singlet because it is adjacent to a carbonyl carbon (no directly bonded protons to couple with). Therefore, the structure must contain an acetate group, selecting between propyl acetate and isopropyl acetate.\n\nNext, analyze the splitting information implied by the COSY cross-peak between a triplet and a sextet. The standard $n+1$ rule states that a proton (or set of equivalent protons) coupled to $n$ equivalent neighboring protons appears as a multiplet with $n+1$ lines. When a proton is coupled to two distinct sets of neighbors with $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ equivalent protons and similar coupling constants, the observed pattern approximates $(n_{1}+1)(n_{2}+1)$ lines; if $n_{1}+n_{2}=5$ and the couplings are similar, the pattern often appears as an apparent sextet.\n\nConsider propyl acetate, $\\mathrm{CH_3CO-OCH_2CH_2CH_3}$. Its key proton patterns are:\n- The acetyl methyl $-\\mathrm{COCH_3}$ gives the required singlet near $\\delta\\approx 2.05$ ppm with no COSY cross-peaks.\n- The $\\mathrm{OCH_2}$ group (2 H) is coupled only to the adjacent $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ (2 H), so it appears as a triplet ($n=2\\Rightarrow 3$ lines).\n- The terminal $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ (3 H) is coupled only to the adjacent $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ (2 H), so it appears as a triplet ($n=2\\Rightarrow 3$ lines).\n- The internal $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ is adjacent to $\\mathrm{OCH_2}$ (2 H) and $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ (3 H). Ideal first-order splitting would be $(2+1)(3+1)=12$ lines if the two coupling constants were well separated, but when the two coupling constants are similar, the pattern coalesces into an apparent sextet reflecting a total of five neighboring protons.\n\nTherefore, in propyl acetate there will be COSY cross-peaks between the internal $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ (apparent sextet) and each of the two triplets ($\\mathrm{OCH_2}$ triplet and terminal $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ triplet), satisfying the stated observation of at least one triplet–sextet cross-peak.\n\nNow compare to isopropyl acetate, $\\mathrm{CH_3CO-OCH(CH_3)_2}$. Its isopropyl fragment produces the classic septet for the methine proton (coupled to $n=6$ equivalent methyl protons, giving $6+1=7$ lines) and two equivalent methyl doublets (each $n=1\\Rightarrow 2$ lines). There is no sextet and no triplet in this pattern, so it cannot satisfy the reported triplet–sextet cross-peak.\n\nFinally, the other options do not fit the $\\delta=2.05$ ppm singlet with no COSY correlations: methyl butanoate and ethyl propanoate lack an acetyl methyl singlet; tert-butyl formate lacks an acetyl methyl and instead shows a tert-butyl singlet near $\\delta\\approx 1.2$ and a formyl proton far downfield.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with both the singlet at $\\delta=2.05$ ppm with no COSY correlations and the presence of a triplet–sextet COSY cross-peak is propyl acetate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2150547"}, {"introduction": "COSY truly shines when analyzing complex molecules with multiple interconnected protons, such as aromatic systems.

In a proton COSY, the dominant cross-peaks therefore connect vicinal neighbors along this chain.\n\nFrom the key information, Signal A at $8.90$ ppm is H2. The COSY cross-peak (A, G) then identifies G as the unique vicinal neighbor of H2, namely H3. Thus G $=$ H3. The cross-peak (B, G) requires B to be the other vicinal neighbor of H3, namely H4. Therefore B $=$ H4.\n\nThe remaining cross-peaks, (C, D), (D, E), and (E, F), define a contiguous four-proton fragment. In quinoline, after H4 the sequence continues as H5–H6–H7–H8. Hence the set $\\{C, D, E, F\\}$ must map onto $\\{H5, H6, H7, H8\\}$ in sequence (either forward or reversed) to satisfy those three COSY links.\n\nTo choose the direction, use chemical shift trends. In quinoline, among the benzenoid protons H5–H8, H8 is generally the most downfield (closest to $8.0$ ppm or slightly above), while H5, H6, and H7 appear at lower shifts around $7.5$–$7.8$ ppm with a typical ordering $H5 \\gtrsim H6 \\gtrsim H7$. In the data, the only remaining resonance near $8.1$ ppm is C at $8.09$ ppm, so assign C $=$ H8. The COSY chain then enforces D $=$ H7, E $=$ H6, and F $=$ H5 (the reverse order along the chain), all of which preserves the observed cross-peaks (C with D, D with E, E with F). The relative shifts D $7.76$ ppm, E $7.65$ ppm, F $7.53$ ppm are consistent with H7, H6, and H5, respectively, being progressively more upfield than H8 and close to the expected trend.\n\nCollecting all assignments: A $=$ H2 (given), G $=$ H3 (from A–G), B $=$ H4 (from B–G), C $=$ H8, D $=$ H7, E $=$ H6, F $=$ H5.
