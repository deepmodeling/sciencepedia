Key principles: \n- Primary alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes under anhydrous, mild conditions with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC); aqueous chromic acid (e.g., $Na_2Cr_2O_7$/$H_2SO_4$/$H_2O$) overoxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids.\n- Chemoselectivity between two identical functional groups generally requires temporary protection of one group.\n- Silyl ethers (e.g., TBDMS) protect alcohols; they are installed with a non-nucleophilic base and removed with a fluoride source. Aldehydes are not protected by TBDMSCl.\n- Grignard reagents are incompatible with free alcohols and add to carbonyls to form alcohols, not aldehydes.\n\nEvaluate each route:\n\nA. 1. PCC (1.0 equivalent); 2. $H_2O$. Although PCC stops at the aldehyde for a primary alcohol, here both ends are equally reactive. Using 1.0 equivalent does not enforce selective mono-oxidation at the molecular level; it statistically distributes oxidation across molecules, giving a mixture of unreacted diol and mono-oxidized product, and potentially some over-oxidation if more oxidant is present locally during the reaction. This is not efficient or high-yielding for the selective transformation.\n\nB. 1. $Na_2Cr_2O_7$, $H_2SO_4$, $H_2O$; 2. $LiAlH_4$. Jones conditions oxidize each primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid, producing the diacid (succinic acid). Subsequent $LiAlH_4$ reduces carboxylic acids back to primary alcohols, regenerating the diol. This does not produce the aldehyde; it is a detour back to starting material.\n\nC. 1. TBDMSCl, non-nucleophilic base; 2. PCC; 3. Fluoride source. First, selectively protect one alcohol as a TBDMS ether under controlled stoichiometry to obtain a monoprotected diol. Then oxidize the remaining free primary alcohol with PCC to the aldehyde. Finally, remove the TBDMS group with a fluoride source (e.g., TBAF) to regenerate the free alcohol, yielding 4-hydroxybutanal. This strategy is standard for high-yield, chemoselective oxidation when two identical alcohols are present.\n\nD. 1. PCC; 2. TBDMSCl, non-nucleophilic base. Oxidation first risks forming the dialdehyde (with excess PCC) or an inseparable mixture; moreover, TBDMSCl protects alcohols, not aldehydes, so it cannot secure the newly formed aldehyde, and it does not address the need to leave the other alcohol unoxidized. Not an effective route.\n\nE. 1. $SOCl_2$; 2. Mg, ether; 3. $CH_2O$, then $H_3O^+$. Converting one alcohol to a chloride, then to a Grignard reagent, is incompatible with the remaining free alcohol (which would quench the Grignard). Reaction with formaldehyde followed by workup gives a longer-chain alcohol, not an aldehyde. This does not achieve the target.\n\nConclusion: The protection–oxidation–deprotection sequence in option C is the most efficient and high-yielding route to 4-hydroxybutanal from 1,4-butanediol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2192351"}, {"introduction": "The principles of protection are not limited to alcohols; they are equally vital for managing carbonyl reactivity.

This requires chemoselective reduction via temporary protection of one aldehyde.\n\nPrinciples used:\n- Under acid catalysis, aldehydes react with diols to give acetals. Acetals are stable to basic and nucleophilic conditions, including hydride donors such as $NaBH_{4}$.\n- $NaBH_{4}$ reduces aldehydes to primary alcohols but does not reduce acetals.\n- Acetals can be hydrolyzed back to aldehydes under aqueous acidic conditions.\n- Bulky diols such as 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol favor monoprotection of one carbonyl in a dialdehyde, whereas smaller diols (e.g., 1,2-ethanediol) more readily lead to overprotection (both aldehydes protected), undermining selectivity.\n\nCorrect three-step logic:\n1) Protect one aldehyde as an acetal using a diol and catalytic acid.\n2) Reduce the unprotected aldehyde with $NaBH_{4}$ in methanol to a primary alcohol; the acetal remains intact.\n3) Hydrolyze the acetal under aqueous acid to regenerate the aldehyde, giving the target molecule with one end as an alcohol and the other as an aldehyde.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: $NaBH_{4}$ in methanol reduces both aldehydes to a diol at step 1. Subsequent $PBr_{3}$ and $Mg$ (Grignard formation) cannot regenerate a mono-alcohol/mono-aldehyde pattern; this does not yield the target.\n- B: 1,2-ethanediol + cat. TsOH can form acetals, but with a dialdehyde it commonly overprotects both ends due to low steric hindrance, leaving no free aldehyde for $NaBH_{4}$ reduction in step 2; after the final acid workup, one would simply revert to the starting dialdehyde or obtain poor selectivity. This sequence is not reliably selective for monoprotection.\n- C: 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol + cat. TsOH selectively protects one aldehyde due to steric bulk, $NaBH_{4}$ then reduces only the other aldehyde to the primary alcohol, and aqueous acid deprotects to regenerate the unmodified aldehyde. This gives the desired 5-formyl-4-isopropylpentan-1-ol.\n- D: After protecting one aldehyde, $CH_{3}MgBr$ would add to the remaining aldehyde to form a secondary alcohol rather than effect reduction; this is not the target functional group pattern.\n- E: Starting with aqueous acid does not protect; $NaBH_{4}$ in the next step would reduce both aldehydes to a diol, and adding diol with TsOH last cannot create an acetal from an alcohol; this fails.\n\nTherefore, only option C implements the correct protecting group strategy and chemoselective reduction to reach the target.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2192355"}, {"introduction": "A truly powerful synthetic strategy relies on the principle of orthogonality, where functional group transformations do not disturb existing protecting groups.

As part of their proposed route, they successfully synthesized the intermediate 4-(benzyloxymethyl)-2-nitrophenol. The next crucial step is to selectively reduce the nitro group to an amine without affecting the other functional groups.\n\nThe student proposes the following transformation:\n\n**Proposed Step:** Treat 4-(benzyloxymethyl)-2-nitrophenol with an excess of molecular hydrogen ($H_2$) over a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst in ethanol at room temperature.\n\nThe student's goal for this step is to form 2-amino-4-(benzyloxymethyl)phenol, which would then be carried forward. However, upon analyzing the reaction mixture, the student finds that the desired product is not the major component.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the fundamental flaw in the proposed step and suggests a chemically sound alternative to achieve the desired selective reduction?\n\nA. The flaw is that catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is not a sufficiently powerful method to reduce an aromatic nitro group. A more appropriate method would be to use lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) in tetrahydrofuran (THF).\n\nB. The flaw is that catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C also causes hydrogenolysis, which will cleave the benzyl ether protecting group. A more appropriate method would be to use tin(II) chloride ($SnCl_2$) dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl), followed by a basic workup.\n\nC. The flaw is that the phenolic hydroxyl group will poison the palladium catalyst, preventing any reaction from occurring. The phenol should first be protected as a silyl ether before attempting the reduction.\n\nD. The flaw is that the Pd/C catalyst will non-selectively reduce both the nitro group and the aromatic ring. A more appropriate method would be to use a milder catalyst, such as Lindlar's catalyst.\n\nE. The flaw is that the benzyl ether is unstable under the reaction conditions and rearranges to form a diphenylmethane derivative. A more appropriate method would be to use sodium borohydride ($NaBH_4$) in the presence of a nickel(II) chloride catalyst.", "solution": "Identify the functional groups present and their reactivity under the proposed conditions:\n- The substrate 4-(benzyloxymethyl)-2-nitrophenol contains (i) an aromatic nitro group, (ii) a phenolic hydroxyl group, and (iii) a benzyl ether embedded in the benzyloxymethyl substituent, namely an $O$–$CH_{2}$–Ph linkage at the benzylic position.\n- Catalytic hydrogenation with $H_{2}$ over Pd/C at room temperature is well known to reduce aromatic nitro groups to anilines efficiently. Therefore, the nitro-to-amine transformation is feasible under these conditions and does not represent a lack of reducing power.\n\nAssess the selectivity issue with Pd/C hydrogenation:\n- A fundamental property of Pd/C hydrogenation is hydrogenolysis of benzylic $C$–$O$ bonds. Benzyl ethers (Ar–$CH_{2}$–O–R or R–O–$CH_{2}$–Ph) are classic protecting groups that are cleaved under $H_{2}$/Pd/C conditions. This cleavage occurs at the benzylic $C$–O bond, yielding the deprotected alcohol and toluene (or benzyl alcohol under some conditions).\n- In the present substrate, the benzyloxymethyl group is R–O–$CH_{2}$–Ph with R being the benzylated hydroxymethyl fragment bound to the ring. Under $H_{2}$/Pd/C, the hydrogenolysis reaction selectively cleaves at the benzylic carbon–oxygen bond to give the free hydroxymethyl group (–$CH_{2}$–OH) on the aromatic ring, concomitant with formation of toluene from the benzyl moiety. Thus, the intended benzyl protection is lost during the hydrogenation.\n- Consequently, the proposed step will not selectively produce 2-amino-4-(benzyloxymethyl)phenol; instead, it will tend to give the amine with concomitant deprotection of the benzyloxymethyl to a hydroxymethyl substituent, explaining why the desired product is not the major component.\n\nPropose a chemically sound alternative that preserves the benzyl protecting group while reducing the nitro group:\n- A standard, chemoselective method to reduce aromatic nitro groups to anilines in the presence of benzyl ethers is the use of $SnCl_{2}$ in concentrated $HCl$, which reduces the nitro group to the anilinium salt without effecting hydrogenolysis. A subsequent basic workup liberates the free aniline.\n- This approach avoids the use of molecular hydrogen and palladium, thereby preventing cleavage of the benzyl ether.\n\nEvaluate the provided options:\n- A is incorrect because Pd/C hydrogenation is sufficiently powerful to reduce aromatic nitro groups; LAH is unnecessary and introduces additional chemoselectivity risks.\n- B is correct: Pd/C will hydrogenolyze benzyl ethers; $SnCl_{2}$/HCl with basic workup is an established alternative that preserves benzyl protecting groups while reducing nitro groups.\n- C is incorrect: phenolic OH does not generally poison Pd/C to the point of preventing nitro reduction under these conditions, and protecting the phenol as a silyl ether is unnecessary for this purpose.\n- D is incorrect: under mild $H_{2}$/Pd/C conditions at room temperature, aromatic ring hydrogenation is not competitive; the principal side reaction is benzyl ether hydrogenolysis.\n- E is incorrect: benzyl ethers do not rearrange to diphenylmethane derivatives under $H_{2}$/Pd/C; $NaBH_{4}$ with $NiCl_{2}$ is not a standard, selective protocol for this transformation in the presence of benzyl ethers.\n\nTherefore, the flaw and the correct alternative are identified by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2192367"}]}
