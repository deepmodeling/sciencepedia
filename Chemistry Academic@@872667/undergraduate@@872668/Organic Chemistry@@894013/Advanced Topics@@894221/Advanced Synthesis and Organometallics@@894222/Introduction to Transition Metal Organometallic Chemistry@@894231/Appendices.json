The catalyst chosen for this transformation is a well-known organometallic complex with the chemical formula $\\text{RhCl(PPh}_3)_3$, often called Wilkinson's catalyst. To understand the reaction mechanism, the chemist must first characterize the electronic state of the metal center in the starting catalyst. The complex as a whole is electrically neutral.
