## Introduction
Organolithium reagents are among the most powerful and versatile tools in the arsenal of a synthetic organic chemist. Often depicted simply as "R-Li," their true nature is far more complex, governing a vast range of transformations from simple [acid-base reactions](@entry_id:137934) to the construction of intricate molecular architectures. The ability to form carbon-carbon bonds with precision and control is central to organic synthesis, and in this regard, [organolithium reagents](@entry_id:183206) are unparalleled in their utility. However, harnessing their potent reactivity requires a deep understanding of their structure, the factors that modulate their reactivity, and their distinct reaction pathways with various electrophiles.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Organolithium reagents are a cornerstone of modern organic synthesis, valued for their exceptional reactivity as both potent bases and powerful carbon-centered nucleophiles. Their utility stems from the unique nature of the carbon-lithium bond. This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles governing the structure and reactivity of these reagents, explores the primary methods for their preparation, and details their characteristic reaction pathways with a variety of electrophiles.

### The Carbon-Lithium Bond and the Phenomenon of Aggregation

The carbon-lithium ($C-Li$) bond is best described as a highly [polar covalent bond](@entry_id:136468). Due to the large difference in [electronegativity](@entry_id:147633) between carbon (approx. 2.55) and lithium (approx. 0.98), the bonding electrons are heavily polarized towards the carbon atom. This polarization imparts significant **carbanionic character** to the organic moiety, making the carbon atom electron-rich, highly basic, and nucleophilic. It is this fundamental property that drives the vast majority of reactions involving organolithium compounds.

A fascinating and critically important structural feature of [organolithium reagents](@entry_id:183206) is their tendency to self-associate into **aggregates**. In non-coordinating, non-polar hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane or cyclohexane, simple alkyllithiums like *n*-butyllithium ($n$-BuLi) or methyllithium ($CH_3Li$) do not exist as simple monomeric $R-Li$ units. Instead, they form well-defined oligomers, most commonly tetramers or hexamers. These structures, such as the cubic tetramer for methyllithium, are held together by electron-deficient, multi-center bonds where lithium atoms and the $\alpha$-carbons of the alkyl groups occupy the vertices of a polyhedron. Within these aggregates, the carbanionic centers are coordinatively saturated and sterically shielded, rendering them significantly less reactive than their monomeric counterparts.

The reactivity of an organolithium solution is therefore not determined by its bulk concentration, but by the concentration of the reactive, low-order aggregates or monomers that exist in equilibrium with the larger, dormant clusters. To unlock the full synthetic potential of these reagents, it is often necessary to intentionally break up, or **deaggregate**, these clusters. This is achieved through the use of coordinating solvents, which are Lewis bases that can interact with the Lewis acidic lithium centers.

A common strategy involves using polar aprotic ethereal solvents like tetrahydrofuran (THF). The oxygen [lone pairs](@entry_id:188362) in THF coordinate strongly to the lithium atoms, solvating them and disrupting the Li-C-Li interactions that hold the aggregates together. This shifts the equilibrium from large, unreactive oligomers towards smaller, highly reactive species like dimers and monomers. The practical consequence is a dramatic increase in reaction rate. For example, the [nucleophilic addition](@entry_id:196792) of methyllithium to acetone is exceedingly slow in hexane but proceeds rapidly in THF. This rate enhancement is not primarily due to the stabilization of the product alkoxide, but is a direct result of THF's ability to deaggregate the methyllithium, thereby increasing the effective concentration of the reactive nucleophile [@problem_id:2190791].

For particularly demanding reactions, such as the deprotonation of very weak carbon acids, even more powerful coordinating agents are employed. **Tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA)** is a classic example. As a bidentate chelating ligand, TMEDA binds to a single lithium ion through both of its nitrogen atoms. This **[chelate effect](@entry_id:139014)** makes it exceptionally effective at sequestering lithium cations and breaking apart organolithium aggregates. The addition of a stoichiometric amount of TMEDA to a hexane solution of *n*-BuLi generates a highly reactive complex, often represented as $n$-BuLi·TMEDA. This "superbasic" system can perform metalations that are kinetically inaccessible with *n*-BuLi in hexane alone, such as the efficient deprotonation of toluene at the benzylic position to form benzyllithium [@problem_id:2190773].

### Preparation of Organolithium Reagents

Several reliable methods exist for the preparation of [organolithium reagents](@entry_id:183206), each suited to different starting materials and desired structures.

#### Reductive Metalation of Organic Halides

The classical method for preparing alkyllithiums involves the direct reaction of an organic halide with lithium metal, typically as a fine dispersion or wire in a hydrocarbon or ether solvent. Two equivalents of lithium metal are consumed per equivalent of halide.

$R-X + 2 Li \longrightarrow R-Li + LiX$ (where $X = Cl, Br, I$)

The mechanism of this transformation is understood to proceed through **single-electron transfer (SET)** from the surface of the lithium metal to the organic halide. This initial step generates a radical anion, $[\text{R-X}]^{\bullet -}$, which rapidly fragments into an alkyl radical ($R^{\bullet}$) and a halide anion ($X^-$). The alkyl radical then reacts further to form the organolithium species. A crucial consequence of forming a transient alkyl radical intermediate is the loss of stereochemical information. A carbon-centered radical, such as the *sec*-butyl radical, is typically $sp^2$-hybridized and [trigonal planar](@entry_id:147464). Subsequent trapping to form the C-Li bond can occur from either face of the planar radical with equal probability. Therefore, if one starts with an enantiomerically pure chiral halide, such as (R)-2-bromobutane, the resulting *sec*-butyllithium will be a **racemic mixture** of (R)- and (S)-enantiomers [@problem_id:2190749].

#### Halogen-Metal Exchange

A milder and often more versatile method for preparing certain [organolithium reagents](@entry_id:183206), particularly aryllithiums and vinyllithiums, is **halogen-metal exchange**. This involves treating an organic halide with a pre-formed alkyllithium, commonly *n*-BuLi or *sec*-BuLi.

$R-X + R'-Li \rightleftharpoons R-Li + R'-X$

The reaction is an equilibrium, and it is driven in the forward direction if the newly formed organolithium ($R-Li$) is more stable than the starting organolithium ($R'-Li$). For instance, the $sp^2$-hybridized [carbanion](@entry_id:194580) of an aryllithium is more stable than the $sp^3$-hybridized [carbanion](@entry_id:194580) of an alkyllithium. Consequently, reacting bromobenzene with *n*-butyllithium provides an efficient route to phenyllithium, with the equilibrium lying far to the right [@problem_id:2190813]. These exchanges are typically very fast, even at low temperatures (e.g., -78 °C), which helps to suppress unwanted side reactions.

#### Deprotonation (Metalation)

The exceptional basicity of organolithiums allows them to be prepared by the deprotonation of C-H bonds that are even weakly acidic. The feasibility of the reaction depends on the relative acidities of the hydrocarbon being deprotonated and the hydrocarbon corresponding to the organolithium base.

A powerful driving force for deprotonation is the formation of a highly stabilized [conjugate base](@entry_id:144252). A prime example is the reaction of cyclopentadiene ($pK_a \approx 16$) with *n*-butyllithium. The removal of a proton from the $sp^3$-hybridized carbon of cyclopentadiene generates the **[cyclopentadienyl](@entry_id:147913) anion**. This anion is cyclic, planar, fully conjugated, and contains six $\pi$ electrons—a number that satisfies **Hückel's rule for aromaticity** ($4n+2$ $\pi$ electrons, with $n=1$). The immense thermodynamic stabilization gained upon forming this aromatic system drives the [acid-base reaction](@entry_id:149679) to completion, yielding cyclopentadienyllithium and butane gas [@problem_id:2190790].

This principle can be extended to more subtle cases through [kinetic control](@entry_id:154879). **Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM)** is a powerful strategy that uses a functional group within a molecule to direct deprotonation to a specific, adjacent site. A Lewis basic "directing group," such as an [amide](@entry_id:184165), ether, or sulfoxide, coordinates to the lithium ion of the organolithium base. This forms a pre-reaction complex that positions the basic alkyl group in close proximity to the ortho C-H bond. Deprotonation then occurs via a kinetically favored five- or six-membered cyclic transition state. For example, when N,N-dimethylbenzamide is treated with *sec*-butyllithium, deprotonation occurs preferentially at the ortho position, not at the meta, para, or N-methyl positions. The reason is that coordination of the amide carbonyl oxygen to the lithium ion directs the butyl anion intramolecularly to the ortho proton, leading to a chelate-stabilized ortho-lithiated species [@problem_id:2190792].

### Reactions of Organolithium Reagents

The dual nature of organolithiums as both strong bases and strong nucleophiles dictates their reaction patterns. The outcome of a reaction often depends on a subtle interplay of kinetics, thermodynamics, and the specific [electrophile](@entry_id:181327) involved.

#### Organolithiums as Brønsted Bases

The first and foremost reactivity to consider for an organolithium reagent is its basicity. They will rapidly and irreversibly deprotonate any functional group with an acidic proton, including [alcohols](@entry_id:204007), phenols, thiols, amines, and terminal [alkynes](@entry_id:746370). This [acid-base reaction](@entry_id:149679) is typically much faster than any [nucleophilic addition](@entry_id:196792) or substitution. If a molecule contains both a protic functional group and another electrophilic site, the organolithium will act as a base first.

For example, if 4-chlorobutan-1-ol is treated with one equivalent of *n*-BuLi, the organolithium does not act as a nucleophile to displace the chloride. Instead, it instantly deprotonates the alcohol to form a lithium [alkoxide](@entry_id:182573) and butane. The resulting intermediate, lithium 4-chlorobutoxide, is then perfectly poised for a rapid intramolecular $S_N2$ reaction. The alkoxide displaces the chloride at the other end of the four-carbon chain, forming the stable five-membered ring of tetrahydrofuran (THF) [@problem_id:2190802]. This example underscores the importance of protecting protic groups or accounting for their reaction when designing a synthesis with organolithiums.

#### Nucleophilic Additions

When acidic protons are absent, organolithiums excel as carbon nucleophiles, readily attacking a wide range of electrophilic carbon centers.

**Addition to Carbonyl Compounds**: Organolithiums add to aldehydes and ketones to produce secondary and tertiary [alcohols](@entry_id:204007), respectively, after an aqueous workup. Their reaction with [esters](@entry_id:182671) is particularly noteworthy. The initial [nucleophilic attack](@entry_id:151896) on the [ester](@entry_id:187919) carbonyl forms a [tetrahedral intermediate](@entry_id:203100). This intermediate is unstable and collapses, expelling the alkoxy group (-OR) as a leaving group to form a ketone. Crucially, ketones are generally *more* electrophilic and thus more reactive towards organolithium addition than the starting esters. Therefore, if a sufficient amount of organolithium is present, the newly formed ketone is immediately attacked by a second equivalent of the reagent. The net result is that the reaction of an [ester](@entry_id:187919) with at least two equivalents of an organolithium reagent yields a tertiary alcohol, following an aqueous workup [@problem_id:2190765]. For instance, treating methyl acetate with excess methyllithium produces 2-methylpropan-2-ol.

The high reactivity of organolithiums is highlighted when compared to the less reactive Grignard reagents ($RMgX$). While an excess of either reagent will lead to the double-addition product, the greater kinetic drive of the organolithium can lead to this outcome even when a stoichiometric amount (1 equivalent) is used, as it preferentially attacks the more reactive ketone as it forms, consuming itself before all the starting ester has reacted [@problem_id:2190746].

**Addition to Epoxides**: Organolithiums efficiently open epoxide rings via an $S_N2$ mechanism. The attack typically occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon atom, resulting in the formation of a new C-C bond and an [alkoxide](@entry_id:182573). Subsequent protonation during workup yields an alcohol. This reaction serves as an excellent method for extending a carbon chain by two atoms. For example, the phenyllithium generated from bromobenzene reacts with [ethylene](@entry_id:155186) oxide to form, after workup, 2-phenylethanol [@problem_id:2190813].

#### Selectivity in Additions to $\alpha,\beta$-Unsaturated Systems

Molecules containing a [carbonyl group](@entry_id:147570) conjugated with a carbon-carbon double bond, known as $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated carbonyls, possess two distinct electrophilic sites: the carbonyl carbon (C2) and the $\beta$-carbon (C4). Nucleophilic attack can occur at either site, leading to **1,2-addition** or **1,4-[conjugate addition](@entry_id:184184)**, respectively. The regiochemical outcome is often predictable based on the **Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB)** principle.

Organolithium reagents are considered **hard nucleophiles**. The C-Li bond is highly polarized, resulting in a high concentration of negative charge on a small carbon atom. Hard nucleophiles preferentially attack the harder electrophilic site, which in an enone system is the carbonyl carbon. Thus, organolithiums strongly favor 1,2-addition. The reaction of methyllithium with [methyl vinyl ketone](@entry_id:184522), for instance, results in attack at the carbonyl group to give, after workup, the tertiary allylic alcohol 2-methylbut-3-en-2-ol [@problem_id:2190754].

#### Transmetalation: Formation and Reactivity of Gilman Reagents

The reactivity of [organolithium reagents](@entry_id:183206) can be synthetically tailored through **[transmetalation](@entry_id:154344)**, which is the exchange of the metal with another. A particularly useful transformation is the reaction of two equivalents of an organolithium with one equivalent of a copper(I) salt, such as copper(I) iodide (CuI), to form a **[lithium diorganocuprate](@entry_id:181902)**, commonly known as a **Gilman reagent**.

$2 R-Li + CuI \longrightarrow Li[R_2Cu] + LiI$

The resulting cuprate, for example, lithium dimethylcuprate ($Li[Cu(CH_3)_2]$) [@problem_id:2190772], has drastically different reactivity from the parent organolithium. The C-Cu bond is significantly less polar than the C-Li bond, rendering the cuprate a much **softer nucleophile**.

This change in hardness has profound implications for selectivity. When a Gilman reagent is reacted with an $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated carbonyl, it now preferentially attacks the softer electrophilic site—the $\beta$-carbon—in a **1,4-[conjugate addition](@entry_id:184184)**. In stark contrast to the reaction with methyllithium, treating [methyl vinyl ketone](@entry_id:184522) with lithium dimethylcuprate leads to the addition of a methyl group at the $\beta$-position. The resulting [enolate](@entry_id:186227) is then protonated during workup to yield the saturated ketone, pentan-2-one [@problem_id:2190754]. This complementary reactivity between "hard" organolithiums (1,2-addition) and "soft" organocuprates (1,4-addition) provides chemists with precise control over [bond formation](@entry_id:149227) in complex systems.
