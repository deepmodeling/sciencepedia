The structure of the target molecule, 2-methyl-2-butanol, is a tertiary alcohol with the formula $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}(\\text{OH})(\\text{CH}_3)_2$. The central carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group is a tertiary carbinol center. It is bonded to one ethyl group and two methyl groups.\n\nTertiary alcohols can be synthesized using Grignard reagents in two primary ways:\n1.  The reaction of a ketone with a Grignard reagent.\n2.  The reaction of an ester with at least two equivalents of a Grignard reagent.\n\nLet's analyze each pathway for the synthesis of 2-methyl-2-butanol.\n\n**Pathway 1: Ketone + Grignard Reagent**\nIn this retrosynthetic approach, we disconnect one of the carbon-carbon bonds attached to the carbinol carbon. The Grignard reagent corresponds to the nucleophilic alkyl group (formally an $R^-$ synthon), and the ketone corresponds to the electrophilic carbonyl component.\n\n*   **Disconnection A: Breaking an ethyl-carbinol bond.**\n    If we disconnect the ethyl group, the synthons are an ethyl anion ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2^-$) and a cation derived from acetone ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{C}^+(\\text{OH})\\text{CH}_3$). The synthetic equivalents are an ethyl Grignard reagent (such as ethylmagnesium bromide, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{MgBr}$) and acetone ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{C}(=\\text{O})\\text{CH}_3$). The reaction is:\n    $$ \\text{CH}_3\\text{C}(=\\text{O})\\text{CH}_3 + \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{MgBr} \\rightarrow \\text{Intermediate Alkoxide} \\xrightarrow{\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+} \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}(\\text{OH})(\\text{CH}_3)_2 $$\n    This matches the reactants in **Option A**. Therefore, A is a correct choice.\n\n*   **Disconnection B: Breaking a methyl-carbinol bond.**\n    If we disconnect a methyl group, the synthons are a methyl anion ($\\text{CH}_3^-$) and a cation derived from butan-2-one ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}^+(\\text{OH})\\text{CH}_3$). The synthetic equivalents are a methyl Grignard reagent (e.g., methylmagnesium bromide, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{MgBr}$) and butan-2-one ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}(=\\text{O})\\text{CH}_3$). The reaction is:\n    $$ \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}(=\\text{O})\\text{CH}_3 + \\text{CH}_3\\text{MgBr} \\rightarrow \\text{Intermediate Alkoxide} \\xrightarrow{\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+} \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}(\\text{OH})(\\text{CH}_3)_2 $$\n    This matches the reactants in **Option B**. Therefore, B is a correct choice.\n\n**Pathway 2: Ester + Grignard Reagent**\nThis pathway works when the target tertiary alcohol has at least two identical alkyl groups attached to the carbinol carbon. Our target, 2-methyl-2-butanol, has two identical methyl groups. This means we can add two equivalents of a methyl Grignard reagent to an appropriate ester. The remaining part of the molecule that must come from the ester is the ethyl group. The ester must therefore be a propanoate. For example, ethyl propanoate ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}(=\\text{O})\\text{OCH}_2\\text{CH}_3$).\nThe reaction proceeds in two steps. First, one equivalent of Grignard reagent adds to the ester to form a ketone intermediate (butan-2-one in this case), which is highly reactive towards the Grignard reagent. A second equivalent of the Grignard reagent immediately attacks the ketone.\n$$ \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}(=\\text{O})\\text{OR} + 2 \\text{ CH}_3\\text{MgBr} \\rightarrow \\text{Intermediate Alkoxide} \\xrightarrow{\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+} \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}(\\text{OH})(\\text{CH}_3)_2 $$\nThis matches the reactants in **Option D**. Therefore, D is a correct choice.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the incorrect options:\n\n*   **Option C: Diethyl ketone and methylmagnesium bromide.**\n    Diethyl ketone is $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}(=\\text{O})\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$. Reaction with $\\text{CH}_3\\text{MgBr}$ would add a methyl group to the carbonyl carbon, yielding 3-methyl-3-pentanol, $(\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2)_2\\text{C}(\\text{OH})\\text{CH}_3$, which is not the target product. So, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option E: Propanoic acid and methylmagnesium bromide.**\n    Grignard reagents are very strong bases. Propanoic acid ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{COOH}$) is an acid. The first reaction will be a rapid acid-base neutralization where the Grignard reagent deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form methane gas and a magnesium carboxylate salt. This is not a method for preparing a tertiary alcohol. So, E is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option F: 2-Methylpropanal and ethylmagnesium bromide.**\n    2-Methylpropanal ($(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHC}(=\\text{O})\\text{H}$) is an aldehyde. The reaction of an aldehyde with a Grignard reagent yields a secondary alcohol. The product would be 2-methyl-3-pentanol, $(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHCH}(\\text{OH})\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$. The target product is a tertiary alcohol. So, F is incorrect.\n\nIn summary, the correct combinations of reactants are given in options A, B, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2197485"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple functional group interconversions, a key skill in retrosynthesis is recognizing the structural patterns left by powerful named reactions.
