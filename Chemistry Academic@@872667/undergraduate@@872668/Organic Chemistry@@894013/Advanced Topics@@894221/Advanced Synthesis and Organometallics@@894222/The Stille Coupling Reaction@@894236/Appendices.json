The Stille coupling is highly valued for its stereospecificity, particularly when using vinyl halides, as it typically proceeds with retention of the double bond's original geometry. This practice challenges you to apply this principle to predict the precise stereochemical outcome of a coupling reaction involving a vinyl bromide.

When the organohalide is a vinyl halide, the reaction is typically stereospecific with retention of the alkene geometry.\n\nStarting from (E)-1-bromopropene (a vinyl bromide), Pd(0) undergoes oxidative addition into the C–Br bond to give a vinylpalladium(II) intermediate. For vinyl halides, this step occurs in a manner that preserves the original alkene geometry because there is no free rotation about the C–C double bond and the intermediate does not equilibrate under standard Stille conditions. Next, transmetalation with tributyl(phenyl)tin transfers the phenyl group to palladium, generating a vinyl–phenyl Pd(II) species. Finally, reductive elimination forms the new C–C bond between the vinylic carbon (the site that originally bore bromine) and the phenyl group, again without altering the double-bond geometry.\n\nTherefore, the bromine at C1 of (E)-1-bromopropene is replaced by phenyl with overall retention of the E configuration, yielding (E)-1-phenylpropene as the major product.\n\nThus, the correct choice is (E)-1-phenylpropene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2213218"}, {"introduction": "Synthetic planning often involves molecules with multiple reactive sites, requiring a chemist to predict which site will react preferentially. This concept, known as chemoselectivity, is a key consideration in the Stille coupling, where different leaving groups on the electrophile exhibit different reactivities toward oxidative addition.

Therefore, with one equivalent of the vinyl stannane, oxidative addition occurs predominantly at the C–OTf bond, not at the C–Br bond.\n\nPredict the product under monosubstitution: since only one equivalent of vinyl stannane is present, only one coupling event occurs. The coupling at the aryl triflate site replaces OTf with vinyl, leaving the bromide intact. This gives 1-bromo-4-vinylbenzene.\n\nEliminate the alternative options:\n- 1-vinyl-4-(trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy)benzene would require selective coupling at C–Br over the more reactive C–OTf, which is contrary to the typical reactivity order.\n- 1,4-divinylbenzene would require two equivalents of vinyl stannane and coupling at both sites.\n- 4-bromophenol would arise from hydrolysis of the triflate rather than cross-coupling, which is not the outcome under the stated Stille coupling conditions.\n- 4-vinylphenol would require vinylation at bromide followed by deprotection/hydrolysis of triflate to phenol, which is not indicated under the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the single major monosubstituted product is 1-bromo-4-vinylbenzene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2213186"}]}
