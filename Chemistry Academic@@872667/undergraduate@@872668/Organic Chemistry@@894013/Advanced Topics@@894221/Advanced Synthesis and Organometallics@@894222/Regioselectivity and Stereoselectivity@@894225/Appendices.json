Catalytic hydrogenation is a prime example of a stereospecific reaction, where the mechanism dictates a single, predictable spatial arrangement. This exercise asks you to visualize the addition of hydrogen across a double bond on a catalyst's surface to determine the precise stereoisomer formed [@problem_id:2196110].", "problem": "A chemist is investigating the stereochemical outcomes of addition reactions to cyclic alkenes. The starting material for the experiment is 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene. This compound is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation, using gaseous hydrogen ($H_2$) in the presence of a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. The reaction proceeds to completion, yielding 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane as the product.\n\nConsidering the established mechanism for this type of reaction, which of the following statements best describes the stereochemical nature of the 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane product obtained?\n\nA. The product is a single, optically active enantiomer.\nB. The product is a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers).\nC. The product is a single, optically inactive meso compound.\nD. The product is a mixture of diastereomers.\nE. The starting material is unreactive under these conditions and no product is formed.", "solution": "Catalytic hydrogenation of an alkene with $H_2$ over Pd/C proceeds by adsorption of the alkene onto the metal surface, followed by delivery of two hydrogen atoms to the same face of the double bond. This is a stereospecific syn addition: both new C–H bonds form on the same face of the former $\\pi$ bond.\n\nLet the alkene carbons of 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene be $C_1$ and $C_2$. Upon syn addition, both hydrogens are delivered to, say, the top face of the double bond. Consequently, at each of $C_1$ and $C_2$, the newly added H is on the same face (both up), and the pre-existing substituent on that carbon (the methyl group) is oriented on the opposite face (both down). Therefore, in the product, the two methyl groups are on the same face of the ring relative to each other; this is the cis-1,2 relationship.\n\nThe product thus formed is cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. For 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexanes with identical substituents, the cis isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry in an appropriate chair conformation (one methyl axial up and the other methyl equatorial up, or both down in the ring-flipped form). Hence, cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane is a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n\nBecause hydrogenation on Pd/C is stereospecific syn addition, only the cis isomer is formed; the trans-1,2 isomer (which would be a pair of enantiomers) is not produced under these conditions. Addition from the opposite face of the alkene gives the same meso product by symmetry, so the outcome is a single, optically inactive meso compound rather than a racemic mixture or a mixture of diastereomers. The starting cyclohexene is reactive under these conditions, so no unreacted starting material remains.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that the product is a single, optically inactive meso compound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2196110"}, {"introduction": "Truly mastering organic chemistry means understanding not just the rules, but the mechanisms that underpin them. This final practice presents a scenario where two different sets of reagents can hydrate the same alkene to give different constitutional isomers. By analyzing why one pathway allows for molecular rearrangement while the other does not, you will learn how chemists can strategically choose reagents to achieve a desired regiochemical outcome and avoid unwanted side products [@problem_id:2196136].", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is investigating the hydration of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene through two distinct reaction pathways.

Consider the two hydration mechanisms.\n\nFor Pathway B (oxymercuration-demercuration), addition of water occurs in Markovnikov fashion without carbocation rearrangement. Thus, the hydroxyl group adds to the more substituted alkene carbon (carbon 2), giving the secondary alcohol 3,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol. This corresponds to option C and will be a constitutional isomer of the Pathway A product if rearrangement occurs in Pathway A.\n\nFor Pathway A (acid-catalyzed hydration with catalytic $\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4$ in water), proceed stepwise:\n1) Protonation of the double bond occurs such that the more stable carbocation forms. Proton adds to carbon 1, generating a secondary carbocation at carbon 2 adjacent to the quaternary carbon at carbon 3.\n2) A $1,2$-methyl shift from carbon 3 to carbon 2 occurs because carbon 3 is quaternary and migration creates a more stable tertiary carbocation at carbon 3. The positive charge relocates from carbon 2 to carbon 3 after the methyl migration.\n3) Water attacks the tertiary carbocation at carbon 3, followed by deprotonation, yielding a tertiary alcohol with the hydroxyl on carbon 3.\n\nTo name the rearranged product, choose the longest chain containing the hydroxyl group. A suitable chain is a four-carbon chain through the tertiary center; numbering to give the hydroxyl the lowest possible number places the OH at carbon 2 and reveals methyl substituents at carbons 2 and 3, i.e., 2,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol. This is a constitutional isomer of 3,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol (the Pathway B product), consistent with the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the major product via Pathway A is 2,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2196136"}]}
