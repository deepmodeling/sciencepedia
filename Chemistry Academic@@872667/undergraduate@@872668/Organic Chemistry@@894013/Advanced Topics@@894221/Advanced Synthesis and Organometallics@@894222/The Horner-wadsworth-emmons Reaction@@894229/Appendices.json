In this specific instance, benzaldehyde that has been isotopically labeled with deuterium at the formyl position ($C_6H_5CDO$) is used as the carbonyl component. This aldehyde is reacted with the stabilized phosphonate ylide generated by treating triethyl phosphonoacetate (($CH_3CH_2O)_2P(O)CH_2CO_2CH_2CH_3$) with a strong base, sodium hydride (NaH).\n\nThe reaction produces an $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ester.

Base generation of the nucleophile: Sodium hydride deprotonates the methylene of triethyl phosphonoacetate to give the carbanion at the carbon adjacent to phosphorus. Denote this carbon as $C_{b}$. In the starting phosphonate, $C_{b}$ bears $CO_{2}Et$ and two hydrogens; after deprotonation, $C_{b}$ effectively carries one hydrogen and a negative charge stabilized by $P(O)(OEt)_{2}$ and $CO_{2}Et$.\n\n2. Nucleophilic addition: The carbanion at $C_{b}$ adds to the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. Denote the aldehyde carbonyl carbon as $C_{a}$, which initially bears $C_{6}H_{5}$ and $D$ (the formyl deuterium). This step forms a betaine in which $C_{a}$ is tetrahedral and bears $C_{6}H_{5}$, $D$, $O^{-}$, and $C_{b}$.\n\n3. Oxaphosphetane formation: Intramolecular attack of $O^{-}$ on phosphorus forms the four-membered cyclic intermediate with ring atoms $C_{a}-O-P-C_{b}$, preserving the attachments $C_{a}(C_{6}H_{5},D)$ and $C_{b}(CO_{2}Et,H)$.\n\n4. Fragmentation to alkene: The oxaphosphetane undergoes a concerted elimination to give the alkene between $C_{a}$ and $C_{b}$ and the corresponding phosphonate oxide. The substituent mapping in this pericyclic step is retention of the groups originally attached to each carbon:\n$$\\text{On }C_{a}:\\ (C_{6}H_{5},D)\\quad\\text{and on }C_{b}:\\ (CO_{2}Et,H).$$\nTherefore, the product connectivity is\n$$C_{6}H_{5}-C_{a}(D)=C_{b}(H)-CO_{2}Et,$$\nwhich corresponds to the expected trans-ethyl cinnamate framework under HWE conditions, with the deuterium on the vinylic carbon adjacent to the phenyl ring and the hydrogen on the vinylic carbon adjacent to the carboethoxy group.\n\nNo step in the HWE mechanism removes or exchanges the formyl deuterium; the only strong base is directed to the much more acidic phosphonate methylene. Benzaldehyde has no alpha positions for enolization, and deprotonation at the formyl carbon to give an acyl anion is not operative under these conditions. Thus there is no loss or scrambling of the deuterium, and it remains bound to the carbon derived from the aldehyde.\n\nHence, the deuterium atom is located at the vinylic position adjacent to the phenyl group in the major alkene product.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2211239"}, {"introduction": "Successful organic synthesis requires more than just knowing the main reaction; it demands an awareness of potential side reactions and the reactivity of all functional groups present.

Under these same conditions, the phenolic group of both starting material and product is quantitatively deprotonated to a phenoxide, which is a strong nucleophile.\n\nKey reactivity features of the intended product:\n- It is an AB-type monomer: it contains one nucleophilic site (A = phenolic OH, which becomes phenoxide under base) and one electrophilic site (B = the ethyl acrylate ester carbonyl, which undergoes nucleophilic acyl substitution).\n- In the presence of strong base, phenoxide readily performs nucleophilic acyl substitution on activated esters, displacing ethoxide as the leaving group.\n\nStepwise reasoning for formation of the polymeric side product:\n1) NaH deprotonates the phenolic OH of ethyl (E)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acrylate to give the corresponding phenoxide.\n2) This phenoxide performs nucleophilic acyl substitution at the ester carbonyl of another molecule of the same acrylate (tetrahedral intermediate formation followed by collapse and expulsion of ethoxide), forming a new aryl ester linkage between two monomer units.\n3) Crucially, in this AB self-condensation, the acceptor molecule’s phenolic OH remains intact and can itself be deprotonated by base to continue the sequence. Thus, repeated intermolecular transesterification events produce a step-growth polyester comprised of repeating aryl ester linkages and retaining the alkene moiety in the backbone segment derived from the acrylate.\n4) Because NaH is present in excess and the medium is aprotic (minimizing protonation that would terminate reactive phenoxide), high molecular weight polymer can form.\n\nExclusion of other options:\n- B is unlikely because NaH is a strong base but not a hydride donor to reduce aldehydes in aprotic media; formation of 4-vinylphenol via reduction and dehydration followed by vinyl polymerization is not supported under these conditions.\n- C is unlikely because acetal and polyacetal formation are acid-catalyzed processes; strongly basic conditions disfavor acetalization.\n- D is incorrect because NaH does not function as a reducing agent for aldehydes in typical aprotic solvents; 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol would not form by simple reduction with NaH.\n- E is unlikely because the phosphonate moiety resides on the reagent, not on the product; while phenoxide could in principle attack phosphorus to give aryl phosphate esters, there is no difunctional phosphorus species present to drive formation of a high-molecular-weight polyphosphate under these conditions, and the product itself contains no phosphorus.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible high-molecular-weight side product under the stated, strongly basic, aprotic conditions is the step-growth polyester arising from self-condensation (base-catalyzed transesterification) of the intended product, ethyl (E)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acrylate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2211203"}]}
