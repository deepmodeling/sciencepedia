In an experiment, 1-bromo-2-fluorobenzene is treated with 1-octene in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a phosphine ligand, and a tertiary amine base.

The key steps and selectivities are as follows.\n\nFirst, chemoselectivity of oxidative addition: in 1-bromo-2-fluorobenzene, the carbon–bromine bond undergoes oxidative addition to palladium in the zero oxidation state far more readily than the carbon–fluorine bond, because the aryl–fluorine bond is significantly stronger and resistant to oxidative addition under standard Heck conditions. Therefore, the catalytic cycle begins with oxidative addition at carbon–bromine, generating a 2-fluorophenyl–palladium(II)–bromide complex; the aryl fragment that persists in the product is thus 2-fluorophenyl and the bromine is lost.\n\nSecond, alkene coordination and migratory insertion: 1-octene coordinates to the palladium center and undergoes migratory insertion into the aryl–palladium bond. For terminal, electronically unbiased alkenes such as 1-octene, the dominant pathway gives the so-called linear product, in which the aryl group becomes bonded to the terminal carbon of the alkene and palladium ends up on the internal carbon of the newly formed alkyl–palladium intermediate. This regioselectivity arises from a combination of steric and electronic factors under standard phosphine-ligated conditions.\n\nThird, $\\beta$-hydride elimination: the alkyl–palladium intermediate bears a suitable beta hydrogen and undergoes syn $\\beta$-hydride elimination to form the substituted alkene and a palladium–hydride species. Because migratory insertion and $\\beta$-hydride elimination proceed with syn stereochemistry but occur sequentially on opposite faces, the net result is formation of the trans-alkene, i.e., the E stereoisomer, as the major product for arylations of terminal alkenes.\n\nFourth, base turnover: the tertiary amine base captures the hydrogen halide formed (here, hydrogen bromide), facilitating reductive elimination to regenerate palladium in the zero oxidation state and close the catalytic cycle.\n\nPutting these together, coupling occurs at the aryl bromide site to give a 2-fluorophenyl-substituted 1-alkene with E geometry, specifically (E)-1-(2-fluorophenyl)oct-1-ene. Evaluating the options:\n- A is inconsistent because bromine would have been the leaving group and should not remain on the aryl ring.\n- B corresponds to the branched regioisomer, which is not the major product under standard conditions.\n- C matches the expected chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and E stereoselectivity.\n- D is the Z isomer, not favored in the Heck reaction under these conditions.\n- E and F are not Heck coupling products from these reactants.\n\nTherefore, the single major product is (E)-1-(2-fluorophenyl)oct-1-ene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2210934"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the basics of intermolecular couplings, we now turn to the elegant and powerful strategy of intramolecular reactions.

For intramolecular Heck cyclizations, Baldwin’s rules and empirical data indicate that $5$-exo-trig cyclizations are kinetically favored, while $7$-endo-trig (or alternative $7$-membered closures) are disfavored due to higher enthalpic and entropic penalties.

Even if $\\text{C–OTf}$ can undergo oxidative addition competitively, the subsequent slow $7$-membered intramolecular migratory insertion renders that branch unproductive relative to the rapid $5$-exo-trig closure from the $\\text{C–Br}$-activated complex. Thus, the catalytic turnover funnels through the ortho $\\text{C–Br}$ pathway to provide the five-membered heterocycle.\n\nAccount for the fate of the leaving groups. Reaction at $\\text{C–Br}$ consumes bromine and retains the para triflate, whereas reaction at $\\text{C–OTf}$ would consume the triflate and retain bromine. Since the five-membered ring pathway is favored, the major product is the benzofuran-type ring fused to the benzene core and still bears the triflate substituent. Options positing seven-membered ring formation (A or D) contradict the strong preference for $5$-exo-trig closure. Option C is inconsistent with standard intramolecular Heck conditions, which suppress intermolecular pathways. Option E is incompatible with the Heck mechanism, which proceeds by migratory insertion and $\\beta$-hydride elimination rather than cyclopropanation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the product contains a triflate group and a five-membered heterocyclic ring fused to the benzene core.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2210965"}, {"introduction": "The true power of catalytic methods lies in their tunability, allowing chemists to access diverse products from common starting materials.

This species undergoes oxidative addition with 4-iodotoluene. The resulting arylpalladium(II) intermediate then undergoes coordination and subsequent migratory insertion of the ethyl acrylate double bond. At this juncture, the reaction pathway diverges significantly from the classical Mizoroki-Heck mechanism due to the presence of formic acid.\n\nConsider the following list of potential palladium-containing species.

Critically, in this classical cycle, once the migratory insertion has occurred, the pathway does not involve a palladium complex that bears both an alkyl ligand and a hydride simultaneously; instead, the hydride is formed only after $\\beta$-hydride elimination, at which point the alkyl ligand has been converted into an alkene.\n\nIn the reductive Heck variant, the same initial steps occur: Pd(0) undergoes oxidative addition to give an arylpalladium(II) iodide, followed by alkene coordination and migratory insertion to give an alkylpalladium(II) species.
