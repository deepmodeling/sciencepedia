The available starting materials are 1-chlorodecane, which is soluble only in nonpolar organic solvents, and an aqueous solution of sodium cyanide ($\\text{NaCN}$). Due to the immiscibility of the aqueous and organic phases, the reaction rate is negligible without a catalyst. To facilitate the reaction, a phase-transfer catalyst (PTC) is to be used. The student must choose between two available quaternary ammonium salts: tetramethylammonium chloride ($[(\\text{CH}_3)_4\\text{N}]^+\\text{Cl}^-$) and tetrahexylammonium chloride ($[(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{13})_4\\text{N}]^+\\text{Cl}^-$).\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the more effective catalyst and provides the correct reasoning for its superior performance in this two-phase system?\n\nA. Tetramethylammonium chloride is more effective because its smaller size leads to less steric hindrance around the catalytic center, allowing for faster transport of the cyanide anion.\n\nB. Tetrahexylammonium chloride is more effective because its long alkyl chains increase its solubility in the organic phase, enabling it to efficiently shuttle the cyanide anion to the 1-chlorodecane substrate.\n\nC. Tetramethylammonium chloride is more effective because the smaller cation has a higher charge density, leading to a stronger electrostatic interaction with the cyanide anion, which is necessary for transport.\n\nD. Both catalysts are equally effective because the catalytic activity depends only on the quaternary ammonium cation's positive charge, which is the same for both.\n\nE. Tetrahexylammonium chloride is more effective because its larger size allows it to physically disrupt the interface between the two liquid phases, increasing the surface area for the reaction.", "solution": "The target transformation is a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution on a primary alkyl chloride, so the operative step in the organic phase is an $\\mathrm{S_{N}2}$ reaction:\n$$\n\\mathrm{C_{10}H_{21}Cl_{(org)}} + \\mathrm{CN^{-}_{(org)}} \\to \\mathrm{C_{10}H_{21}CN_{(org)}} + \\mathrm{Cl^{-}_{(org)}}.\n$$\nThe rate law in the organic phase is therefore\n$$\nv = k\\,\\left[\\mathrm{C_{10}H_{21}Cl}\\right]_{org}\\left[\\mathrm{CN^{-}}\\right]_{org}.\n$$\nBecause $\\mathrm{CN^{-}}$ is initially confined to the aqueous phase and has negligible solubility in the nonpolar organic phase, $\\left[\\mathrm{CN^{-}}\\right]_{org} \\approx 0$ without a phase-transfer catalyst, making the rate negligible.\n\nA quaternary ammonium phase-transfer catalyst operates by forming an ion pair with the nucleophile in the aqueous phase and then partitioning that ion pair into the organic phase.

This corresponds to option B. The alternative statements are incorrect: steric hindrance around the cation (A) is not the limiting factor in phase transfer; stronger electrostatic interaction from higher charge density (C) neither overcomes immiscibility nor necessarily enhances reactivity in the organic phase; equal effectiveness (D) is false because lipophilicity is crucial; and physical disruption of the interface by larger size (E) is not the operative mechanism of PTC action.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2189382"}, {"introduction": "While a suitable catalyst is necessary, it is not always sufficient for a successful PTC reaction.

This exercise presents a scenario where one reaction proceeds efficiently while another fails under identical conditions, highlighting the profound impact of anion hydration energy on the feasibility of phase transfer [@problem_id:2189379]. Understanding this principle is key to predicting which nucleophiles are compatible with PTC systems.", "problem": "An organic chemist is investigating nucleophilic substitution reactions on 1-bromooctane using a Phase-Transfer Catalysis (PTC) setup. The reaction system consists of two immiscible phases: an organic phase of 1-bromooctane dissolved in toluene, and an aqueous phase containing the nucleophilic salt. Tetrabutylammonium bromide ($(\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9)_4\\text{N}^+ \\text{Br}^-$) is used as the phase-transfer catalyst.\n\nTwo parallel experiments are conducted under identical conditions of temperature and stirring:\n\n*   **Experiment A:** The aqueous phase contains sodium thiocyanate ($\\text{NaSCN}$).

The bisulfite anion ($\\text{HSO}_3^-$) is a significantly weaker nucleophile than the thiocyanate anion ($\\text{SCN}^-$) in all solvents, making the reaction kinetically unfeasible.\n\nB. The sodium bisulfite salt is significantly less soluble in the aqueous phase than sodium thiocyanate, resulting in a very low concentration of available nucleophile.\n\nC. The bisulfite anion ($\\text{HSO}_3^-$) is highly stabilized by a strong hydration shell in the aqueous phase. The energetic cost to desolvate and transport this hydrophilic anion into the organic phase via the catalyst is prohibitively high compared to the more lipophilic thiocyanate anion.\n\nD. The bisulfite anion ($\\text{HSO}_3^-$) acts as a reducing agent, converting the tetrabutylammonium catalyst into an inactive species, thereby halting the catalytic cycle before substitution can occur.\n\nE. The steric bulk of the pyramidal bisulfite anion ($\\text{HSO}_3^-$) prevents it from effectively attacking the primary carbon of 1-bromooctane, whereas the linear thiocyanate anion ($\\text{SCN}^-$) has no such steric impediment.", "solution": "We identify the transformation as an $\\mathrm{S_{N}2}$ substitution of 1-bromooctane by an anionic nucleophile under phase-transfer catalysis (PTC). The key mechanistic requirement is that the reactive anion must be present in the organic phase where the electrophile (1-bromooctane in toluene) resides. Under quaternary ammonium PTC, the catalyst shuttles anions from the aqueous phase to the organic phase by forming a lipophilic ion pair with the quaternary ammonium cation.\n\nFundamental principle 1 (PTC extraction thermodynamics): The ability of an anion $X^{-}$ to be transferred into the organic phase as $Q^{+}X^{-}$ (with $Q^{+}$ a tetrabutylammonium cation) is governed by a free-energy balance\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{transfer}}(X^{-})=\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{desolv,aq}}(X^{-})+\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{pair}}(Q^{+},X^{-})+\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv,org}}(Q^{+}X^{-}),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{desolv,aq}}(X^{-})$ is the free energy to remove the hydration shell of $X^{-}$, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{pair}}(Q^{+},X^{-})$ is the free energy of forming the ion pair with the quaternary ammonium cation, and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv,org}}(Q^{+}X^{-})$ is the free energy of solvating that ion pair in the organic phase. A smaller (more negative) $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{transfer}}$ leads to higher concentration of $Q^{+}X^{-}$ in the organic phase and thus higher reaction rate.\n\nFundamental principle 2 (hydration and polarizability): Strongly hydrated, hard, oxyanions possess large negative $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{hydr}}$ in water, so $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{desolv,aq}}$ is large and positive; they resist extraction. Softer, more polarizable, charge-diffuse anions have weaker hydration and lower $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{desolv,aq}}$, and they form more lipophilic ion pairs with $Q^{+}$ that are better solvated in organic media.\n\nApplication to the two anions:\n- For $X^{-}=\\mathrm{SCN}^{-}$ (thiocyanate), the anion is soft and highly polarizable with charge delocalization over sulfur and nitrogen. Consequently, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{desolv,aq}}(\\mathrm{SCN}^{-})$ is relatively small, $|\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{pair}}(Q^{+},\\mathrm{SCN}^{-})|$ is large due to favorable ion pairing with a bulky lipophilic cation, and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv,org}}(Q^{+}\\mathrm{SCN}^{-})$ is favorable in toluene. Therefore, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{transfer}}(\\mathrm{SCN}^{-})$ is relatively low, allowing significant $Q^{+}\\mathrm{SCN}^{-}$ concentration in the organic phase, where $\\mathrm{SCN}^{-}$ performs $\\mathrm{S_{N}2}$ attack on 1-bromooctane to give octyl thiocyanate.\n- For $X^{-}=\\mathrm{HSO}_{3}^{-}$ (bisulfite), the anion is a hard, strongly hydrated oxyanion with strong hydrogen-bonding to water and high charge density localized on oxygen. Thus, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{desolv,aq}}(\\mathrm{HSO}_{3}^{-})$ is large and positive, and the resulting $Q^{+}\\mathrm{HSO}_{3}^{-}$ ion pair is relatively hydrophilic and poorly solvated in toluene, making $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv,org}}$ unfavorable. Overall, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{transfer}}(\\mathrm{HSO}_{3}^{-})$ is large and positive, so essentially no nucleophile is present in the organic phase and no reaction occurs.\n\nEvaluation of the options using these principles:\n- A is incorrect in its absolutist claim \"in all solvents\" and misidentifies the dominant factor under PTC; nucleophilicity scales are solvent-dependent and here the decisive factor is phase transfer, not intrinsic gas-phase nucleophilicity.\n- B is incorrect because both sodium thiocyanate and sodium bisulfite are readily soluble in water; moreover, PTC is designed to overcome phase separation by extracting anions into the organic phase.\n- C correctly identifies the fundamental thermodynamic barrier: the strong hydration of $\\mathrm{HSO}_{3}^{-}$ renders $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{transfer}}$ prohibitively high relative to $\\mathrm{SCN}^{-}$, preventing effective transport and reaction.\n- D is mechanistically implausible; $\\mathrm{HSO}_{3}^{-}$ does not reduce the quaternary ammonium cation to an inactive species under these conditions.\n- E is not the controlling factor; steric hindrance is minimal for attack at a primary carbon, and the failure arises from transfer/solvation energetics, not sterics.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental reason is the differential hydration and transfer energetics captured in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2189379"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the roles of both the catalyst cation and the nucleophilic anion, we can now integrate these concepts to predict the outcome of a complete PTC reaction.
