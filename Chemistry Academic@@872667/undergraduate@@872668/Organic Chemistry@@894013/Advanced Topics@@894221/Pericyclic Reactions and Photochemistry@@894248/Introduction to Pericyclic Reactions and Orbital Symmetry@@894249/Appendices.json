According to the Woodward–Hoffmann orbital symmetry rules (conservation of orbital symmetry), a thermal $[2+2]$ cycloaddition is symmetry-forbidden via a suprafacial-suprafacial pathway, whereas under photochemical activation the $[2+2]$ cycloaddition becomes symmetry-allowed via a suprafacial-suprafacial interaction of the two $\\pi$ systems. Therefore, under photochemical conditions, cyclopentene and ethylene undergo a concerted $[2+2]$ cycloaddition to form a cyclobutane ring that includes the two alkene carbons from cyclopentene and the two carbons of ethylene.\n\nLabel the double-bond carbons of cyclopentene as $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, and the ethylene carbons as $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$. In the $[2+2]$ cycloaddition, two new $\\sigma$ bonds form between one carbon of each alkene, for example $C_{1}-E_{1}$ and $C_{2}-E_{2}$ (the alternative $C_{1}-E_{2}$ and $C_{2}-E_{1}$ is constitutionally equivalent due to symmetry of ethylene), while the original $\\pi$ bonds $C_{1}{=}C_{2}$ and $E_{1}{=}E_{2}$ become $\\sigma$ bonds within the new four-membered ring. The four-atom cyclobutane ring thus comprises $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, $E_{1}$, and $E_{2}$, sharing the edge $C_{1}-C_{2}$ with the cyclopentane ring. This produces a fused bicyclic skeleton.\n\nCount the total carbons:\n$$5+2=7,$$\nso the framework is a bicycloheptane. To assign the bicyclo nomenclature, choose the bridgeheads as $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$.

Comparing with the options, this corresponds to option A. The other options do not match the constitutional outcome of a photochemical $[2+2]$ cycloaddition between cyclopentene and ethylene: bicyclo$[2.2.1]$heptane (norbornane) arises from a $[4+2]$ cycloaddition, spiro systems share a single atom (not an edge), cycloheptene is a single ring, and 1-vinylcyclopentane would result from simple addition rather than cycloaddition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2178992"}, {"introduction": "Alongside cycloadditions, sigmatropic rearrangements represent another major class of pericyclic reactions, involving the migration of a $\\sigma$-bond across a $\\pi$-system.

This reaction proceeds via a single, concerted pericyclic step in a six-membered, chair-like transition state and is thermally allowed as a suprafacial-suprafacial process consistent with Woodward–Hoffmann rules for a six-electron system.\n\nTo classify the sigmatropic rearrangement, identify the migrating sigma bond and count the number of atoms between the old and new sigma-bond termini along each conjugated system:\n- The migrating sigma bond is the O–allyl bond. In the product, this sigma bond has migrated to become a C–C bond between the ortho carbon of the aromatic ring and the terminal carbon of the allyl group.\n- On the allyl fragment: label the carbon attached to oxygen as C1, then the adjacent sp^{2} carbon as C2, and the terminal sp^{2} carbon as C3. The new bond forms at C3, so the path from the breaking bond (at C1) to the forming bond (at C3) spans three atoms: C1, C2, C3. This contributes a count of 3.\n- On the aryl–oxygen fragment: count from the oxygen atom (position 1) to the ipso carbon of the ring (position 2) and then to the ortho carbon where the new bond forms (position 3). This also contributes a count of 3.\n\nTherefore, the rearrangement is classified as a $[3,3]$-sigmatropic shift, which corresponds to the Claisen rearrangement, matching the observed formation of the ortho-allylated phenol as the sole major product.\n\nThe other options do not match the mechanism or the connectivity change: $[2,3]$ would be characteristic of allylic rearrangements often seen with heteroatoms like sulfur or selenium; $[1,5]$ and $[1,3]$ do not account for the six-membered transition state and ortho selectivity; $[1,7]$ is inconsistent with the observed connectivity and ring participation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2179006"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand pericyclic reactions, one must grasp not only why certain transformations occur but also why others are forbidden.

This molecule features a six-membered ring constrained in a boat conformation, which is bridged between positions 1 and 4 by a single methylene group (C7). A carbon-carbon double bond exists between C2 and C3, and a deuterium atom is bonded to C2. One might hypothesize a thermal equilibrium between this compound and its isomer, 1-deuterio-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, via a concerted [1,3]-sigmatropic shift of the deuterium atom from C2 to the bridgehead position C1. However, experimental attempts to induce this transformation reveal that it has an exceptionally high activation barrier and does not occur under typical thermal conditions.\n\nSelect the statement that provides the most accurate and fundamental reason for why this concerted thermal [1,3]-sigmatropic shift is kinetically prohibited.\n\nA. The product isomer, 1-deuterio-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, is highly unstable due to a violation of Bredt's rule, rendering the reaction strongly endergonic.\n\nB. The transition state for the migration is severely destabilized by steric repulsion between the migrating deuterium atom and the endo-hydrogen on the C7 methylene bridge.\n\nC. According to Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, the geometrically accessible suprafacial pathway is thermally forbidden because it involves an anti-aromatic, 4-electron Hückel-type transition state. The alternative thermally-allowed antarafacial pathway is geometrically impossible to achieve within the rigid bicyclic framework.\n\nD. The concerted reaction is disfavored because a thermal [1,3]-shift must be suprafacial, but in this specific molecule, achieving the required suprafacial geometry introduces excessive torsional strain in the bicyclic system.\n\nE. The activation energy is dominated by the high energy required for the initial homolytic cleavage of the strong carbon-deuterium bond, which must occur before the deuterium atom can migrate.", "solution": "Identify the reaction class. The hypothesized concerted migration of deuterium from C2 to C1 across the C2=C3 double bond is a $[1,3]$-sigmatropic hydrogen (deuterium) shift.\n\nDetermine the orbital topology and electron count. In a concerted $[1,3]$-H shift, the transition state involves a cyclic array of interacting orbitals comprising the breaking C–D $\\sigma$ bond, the $\\pi$ system of the C2=C3 double bond, and the forming C–D $\\sigma$ bond at C1. The pericyclic loop thus contains $4$ electrons (two from the $\\pi$ bond and two associated with the migrating $\\sigma$ bond), i.e., a $4n$ electron system with $n=1$.\n\nApply the Woodward–Hoffmann selection rules (or equivalently FMO reasoning). For pericyclic processes under thermal conditions:\n- A $4n$-electron suprafacial pathway leads to an antiaromatic Hückel-type transition state and is symmetry-forbidden.\n- The thermally allowed alternative for a $4n$-electron sigmatropic shift is antarafacial migration at one component (for a $[1,3]$-H shift, antarafacial at the migrating hydrogen).\n\nAssess geometric feasibility. Although the antarafacial pathway is the thermally allowed topology for a $[1,3]$ hydrogen shift, achieving antarafacial migration of hydrogen across an allylic framework generally requires approach to opposite faces along the reaction coordinate. In a rigid bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene framework, the required antarafacial geometry is inaccessible due to severe topological constraints imposed by the bridge and the constrained boat-like six-membered ring. Consequently, the only geometrically accessible trajectory is suprafacial, which is thermally forbidden by orbital symmetry, yielding a prohibitively high activation barrier.\n\nEliminate the alternative explanations:\n- A: Bredt’s rule concerns placing a double bond at a bridgehead; adding deuterium at a bridgehead does not violate Bredt’s rule. Thermodynamic instability of the product is not the fundamental cause of the kinetic prohibition.\n- B: While steric effects can modulate barriers, they are not the fundamental reason for the thermal forbiddance of a $[1,3]$-H suprafacial shift; orbital symmetry is.\n- D: This misstates the selection rule; a thermal $[1,3]$-H shift is allowed only antarafacially, not suprafacially.\n- E: A concerted sigmatropic shift does not proceed via prior homolytic cleavage of the C–D bond; no stepwise radical mechanism is implied in the concerted pathway.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental reason is that the thermally allowed antarafacial pathway is geometrically inaccessible in this bicyclic system, while the accessible suprafacial pathway is symmetry-forbidden as a $4$-electron Hückel-type transition state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2178987"}]}
