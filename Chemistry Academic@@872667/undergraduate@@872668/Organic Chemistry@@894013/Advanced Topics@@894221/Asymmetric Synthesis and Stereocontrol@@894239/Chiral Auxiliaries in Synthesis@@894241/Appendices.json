Understanding this fundamental transformation from an achiral reactant to a chiral substrate is crucial for designing any asymmetric synthesis.", "problem": "In a synthetic strategy aimed at achieving stereocontrol, a chemist plans to perform a diastereoselective nucleophilic addition to the achiral starting material, cyclohexanone. To accomplish this, the chemist first reacts cyclohexanone with a chiral auxiliary, (S)-1-phenylethylamine, under acidic conditions with removal of water to form a chiral intermediate. This intermediate will then be subjected to nucleophilic attack in a subsequent step.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate structural description of the isolable chiral intermediate formed in this first step?\n\nA. A compound containing a carbon-nitrogen double bond (C=N). The nitrogen atom is bonded to a chiral carbon, which is itself bonded to a hydrogen, a methyl group, and a phenyl group. The stereochemistry at this chiral carbon is (S).\n\nB. A compound containing a carbon-nitrogen double bond (C=N). The nitrogen atom is bonded to a chiral carbon, which is itself bonded to a hydrogen, a methyl group, and a phenyl group. The stereochemistry at this chiral carbon is (R).\n\nC. An enamine, characterized by a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) adjacent to a nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atom is singly bonded to a carbon of the double bond and is also bonded to the (S)-1-phenylethyl group.\n\nD. A carbinolamine intermediate, in which the original carbonyl carbon of cyclohexanone is singly bonded to both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and the nitrogen atom of the (S)-1-phenylethylamine group.\n\nE. A compound containing a carbon-nitrogen double bond (C=N), where the double bond is external to the six-membered ring. The nitrogen atom is bonded to an ethyl group and a phenyl group, which are attached to different atoms of the original amine.", "solution": "The key transformation is the acid-catalyzed condensation of a ketone (cyclohexanone) with a primary amine [(S)-1-phenylethylamine], performed with continuous removal of water. By general carbonyl–amine condensation chemistry, a primary amine reacts with a ketone to give an imine (Schiff base), not an enamine; enamines arise from secondary amines after loss of water and subsequent deprotonation at the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen.\n\nMechanistically, the steps are as follows:\n- The carbonyl oxygen of cyclohexanone is protonated under acidic conditions, increasing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon.\n- The lone pair on the nitrogen of the primary amine attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral carbinolamine intermediate in which the former carbonyl carbon is bonded to both hydroxyl and the nitrogen substituent.\n- Proton transfers occur to facilitate departure of water; under the stated condition of water removal, the equilibrium is driven toward dehydration (Le Chatelier’s principle), expelling water to generate an iminium species.\n- Deprotonation at nitrogen affords the neutral imine containing a carbon–nitrogen double bond.\n\nRegarding which intermediate is isolable under the specified conditions, the stable product of condensation of a primary amine with a ketone is the imine (Schiff base). The carbinolamine is a transient intermediate under dehydrating conditions and is not the isolable species in the intended synthetic step. An enamine would require a secondary amine and is therefore not formed here.\n\nConcerning stereochemistry, (S)-1-phenylethylamine possesses a stereogenic carbon bonded to hydrogen, methyl, and phenyl substituents. Imine formation does not cleave the C–N bond adjacent to this stereocenter, nor does it involve configurational inversion at that carbon; therefore, the configuration at the auxiliary’s stereocenter is retained as (S) in the imine product. The resulting isolable intermediate is thus the imine whose nitrogen is directly bonded to the chiral (S)-1-phenylethyl group and engaged in a carbon–nitrogen double bond to the exocyclic carbon of the cyclohexanone ring.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly describes an imine (C=N) in which the nitrogen is bonded to the chiral (S)-1-phenylethyl group; the (S) configuration is retained.\n- B incorrectly assigns the configuration as (R).\n- C incorrectly identifies the product as an enamine, which would require a secondary amine.\n- D describes the carbinolamine intermediate, which is not the isolable product under dehydrating conditions.\n- E suggests an unusual connectivity implying alteration of the amine’s substituent framework; the correct product remains the imine with the (S)-1-phenylethyl substituent on nitrogen.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate structural description is given in A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2159673"}, {"introduction": "A successful asymmetric synthesis is judged by its stereoselectivity, which is quantified by metrics like diastereomeric ratio ($dr$) and enantiomeric excess ($ee$). This problem bridges the gap between these two key concepts, asking you to calculate the final enantiomeric purity of a product based on the diastereomeric mixture formed before the auxiliary is cleaved [@problem_id:2159678]. Mastering this calculation is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of any chiral auxiliary-mediated reaction.", "problem": "In an asymmetric synthesis designed to produce a chiral alcohol, an achiral aldehyde is first reacted with a chiral auxiliary, (S)-1-amino-2-(methoxymethyl)pyrrolidine, commonly known as SAMP. The resulting chiral hydrazone is then treated with an organolithium reagent. This sequence generates a pair of diastereomeric intermediates. After chromatographic separation is attempted, analysis reveals that the mixture contains the two diastereomers in a ratio of 98:2. This entire mixture is then subjected to an ozonolysis step, which cleaves the chiral auxiliary, yielding a mixture of the (R) and (S) enantiomers of the final alcohol product. Assuming that the cleavage of the auxiliary proceeds cleanly and does not cause any racemization or epimerization at the newly formed stereocenter, calculate the enantiomeric excess of the final alcohol mixture.\n\nProvide your answer as a decimal value, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "We begin with an achiral aldehyde converted to a chiral hydrazone using a chiral auxiliary (SAMP). Subsequent addition of an organolithium reagent creates a new stereocenter, generating two diastereomeric intermediates in a ratio of 98:2. Let the amounts of these two diastereomers be proportional to 98 and 2, respectively.\n\nUpon ozonolysis, the chiral auxiliary is cleaved cleanly without racemization or epimerization at the stereocenter. Therefore, each diastereomer maps to a distinct enantiomer of the final alcohol in the same proportion. Denoting the amounts of the two enantiomers as $n_{R}$ and $n_{S}$, we have either $(n_{R}, n_{S}) = (98, 2)$ or $(2, 98)$; the enantiomeric excess depends only on the absolute difference.\n\nThe enantiomeric excess is defined by\n$$\nee = \\frac{|n_{R} - n_{S}|}{n_{R} + n_{S}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the values gives\n$$\nee = \\frac{|98 - 2|}{98 + 2} = \\frac{96}{100} = 0.96.\n$$\nRounded to two significant figures, this remains $0.96$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.96}$$", "id": "2159678"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply inducing one stereochemical outcome, sophisticated use of chiral auxiliaries allows chemists to selectively target different stereoisomers by modifying reaction conditions. The Evans aldol reaction is a classic platform for demonstrating this control, where the choice of Lewis acid can dramatically switch the reaction from producing a *syn* product to an *anti* product [@problem_id:2159661]. This problem asks you to identify the reagent responsible for such a reversal, pushing you to think critically about the underlying mechanistic details that govern stereoselection.", "problem": "In a typical Evans aldol reaction, the N-propionyl derivative of (4R,5S)-4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone is treated with dibutylboron triflate ($Bu_2BOTf$) and a hindered amine base such as diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA). The resulting Z-boron enolate is then reacted with an aldehyde, for example, isobutyraldehyde ((CH$_3$)$_2$CHCHO), at low temperature. This standard procedure reliably yields the *syn*-aldol adduct as the major product.\n\nAn organic chemistry student attempts to perform a similar reaction. However, upon characterization of the major product, they are surprised to find that it is the *anti*-aldol adduct, representing a complete reversal of the expected diastereoselectivity. A review of the lab notebook reveals that all reagents and conditions were standard, except for one critical substitution: a different Lewis acidic reagent was used in place of $Bu_2BOTf$ during the enolization step.\n\nWhich of the following Lewis acidic reagents, when substituted for $Bu_2BOTf$, is the most plausible cause for the formation of the *anti*-aldol product as the major isomer?\n\nA. Titanium(IV) chloride ($TiCl_4$)\n\nB. 9-Borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane triflate (9-BBN-OTf)\n\nC. Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA)\n\nD. Trimethylsilyl triflate (TMSOTf)\n\nE. Boron trifluoride etherate ($BF_3 \\cdot OEt_2$)", "solution": "The standard Evans aldol uses $Bu_{2}BOTf$ with a hindered amine base to generate a $Z$-boron enolate of the $N$-acyloxazolidinone. The ensuing aldol addition proceeds through a Zimmerman–Traxler chair transition state in which a $Z$-enolate delivers the nucleophile and electrophile to give the syn aldol as the major product.\n\nTo invert the diastereoselectivity to the anti aldol, one must change either the enolate geometry to $E$ or the nature of the metal to alter the transition state. A well-established principle in the Evans auxiliary platform is:\n- Boron enolates formed with $Bu_{2}BOTf$ are predominantly $Z$ and give syn aldol products.\n- Titanium enolates formed with $TiCl_{4}$ and base are predominantly $E$ and, via the corresponding chair-like transition state, deliver anti aldol products as the major isomer.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A. $TiCl_{4}$ is a strong Lewis acid that forms titanium enolates of $N$-acyloxazolidinones, typically with $E$ geometry, and is classically used in the Evans anti aldol variant. This substitution is known to reverse the diastereoselectivity to anti.\n- B. 9-BBN-OTf is another boron triflate; it would similarly produce a $Z$-boron enolate and thus favor syn, not anti.\n- C. LDA is not a Lewis acid and therefore does not match the described “substitution of a Lewis acidic reagent”; lithium enolates also do not represent the canonical Evans Lewis-acid-mediated enolization and are not the intended answer.\n- D. TMSOTf is a silylating Lewis acid that would more plausibly lead to silyl enol ether formation (Mukaiyama conditions), not the titanium-type anti selectivity inversion under the Evans protocol.\n- E. $BF_{3}\\cdot OEt_{2}$ is a Lewis acid commonly used to activate electrophiles; it is not used to generate the Evans auxiliary enolate and would not enforce the known titanium-based anti outcome.\n\nTherefore, substituting $TiCl_{4}$ for $Bu_{2}BOTf$ is the most plausible cause of observing the anti aldol product as the major isomer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2159661"}]}
