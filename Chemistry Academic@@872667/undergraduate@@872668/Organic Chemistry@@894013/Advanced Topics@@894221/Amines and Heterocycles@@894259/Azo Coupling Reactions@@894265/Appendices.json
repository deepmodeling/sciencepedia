The synthesis proceeds through a standard two-step sequence: first, the formation of an electrophilic diazonium salt from an aromatic amine precursor, and second, the coupling of this diazonium salt with an electron-rich aromatic compound, known as the coupling partner.\n\nWhich of the following pairs correctly identifies the required aromatic amine precursor for the diazonium salt and the necessary coupling partner to achieve the synthesis of 4-(phenyldiazenyl)aniline?\n\nA.

Precursor for diazonium salt: Aniline; Coupling partner: Nitrobenzene", "solution": "We aim to synthesize 4-(phenyldiazenyl)aniline, which is para-aminoazobenzene. In a standard azo coupling sequence, the first step is diazotization of an aromatic amine to give an aryl diazonium salt, and the second step is electrophilic aromatic substitution (azo coupling) of this diazonium species onto an electron-rich aromatic ring.\n\nKey reaction principles:\n- Only aromatic amines form aryl diazonium salts under nitrosation conditions. Symbolically,\n$$\nAr\\text{NH}_{2} \\xrightarrow[\\text{acid}]{\\text{NaNO}_{2}} Ar\\text{N}_{2}^{+}X^{-}.\n$$\n- Azo coupling is an electrophilic aromatic substitution where the aryl diazonium cation $Ar\\text{N}_{2}^{+}$ acts as the electrophile and couples preferentially at the para (or ortho) position of an activated aromatic ring bearing strong electron-donating groups such as $-NH_{2}$ or $-OH$. The coupling product has the general form\n$$\nAr{-}N{=}N{-}Ar',\n$$\nwith the azo group entering para to the activating substituent on $Ar'$ when available.\n\nStructural logic for the target:\n- The target 4-(phenyldiazenyl)aniline has one ring that is unsubstituted phenyl (the “phenyldiazenyl” part) and the other ring bearing an $-NH_{2}$ group para to the azo linkage. In azo coupling, the substituents on the coupling partner ring are retained, while the diazonium ring loses its $-NH_{2}$ functionality (converted to $N_{2}^{+}$ and then to the azo bond). Therefore:\n  - The diazonium precursor ring in the final product should be unsubstituted phenyl, which corresponds to generating the diazonium salt from aniline (unsubstituted on the ring aside from $-NH_{2}$).\n  - The coupling partner must already contain $-NH_{2}$ to furnish the para-amino group in the final product, so the coupling partner should be aniline (or a protected variant such as acetanilide in practice; however, among the provided options, aniline is the correct choice).\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Precursor aniline; coupling partner aniline. This yields $C_6H_5\\text{N}_2^+$ coupling para to $-NH_{2}$ on aniline to give 4-(phenyldiazenyl)aniline. Correct.\n- B: Coupling partner phenol would give a para-hydroxy azo compound, not the target amine. Incorrect.\n- C: Phenol cannot be diazotized; only aromatic amines form diazonium salts. Incorrect.\n- D: Using 4-nitroaniline as precursor would place a nitro group on the diazonium-derived ring in the product, not present in the target; benzene is too deactivated for efficient coupling. Incorrect.\n- E: Nitrobenzene is strongly deactivated and does not serve as an effective coupling partner. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair is aniline as diazonium precursor and aniline as coupling partner.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2156369"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand a reaction mechanism, we must be able to follow the journey of each atom. Isotopic labeling provides an elegant way to do this, and this exercise [@problem_id:2156392] uses a $^{15}$N label to uncover the precise formation of the azo bridge. By tracking the isotope, you will clarify which nitrogen atom originates from the starting amine and which comes from the nitrosating agent, providing definitive proof of the mechanistic pathway.", "problem": "An organic synthesis is performed to produce the azo dye known as Methyl Yellow, or 4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene. The synthesis involves two main sequential steps.\n\nIn the first step, aniline ($C_6H_5\\text{NH}_2$) is treated with an acidic solution of sodium nitrite. The sodium nitrite used in this experiment has been isotopically enriched, such that all of its nitrogen atoms are the $^{15}N$ isotope ($\\text{Na}^{15}\\text{NO}_2$). This step forms a benzenediazonium salt intermediate.\n\nIn the second step, the solution containing the newly formed diazonium salt is immediately added to a solution of N,N-dimethylaniline ($C_6H_5\\text{N}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$), leading to an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction that produces the final azo dye product.\n\nThe resulting product molecule, 4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene, contains a central azo bridge ($-N=N-$) connecting the two aromatic rings.

From $\\text{Na}^{15}\\text{NO}_2$ under strongly acidic conditions, the reactive species is $^{15}\\text{NO}^+$, where the nitrogen in the nitrosyl cation carries the $^{15}\\text{N}$ label. This $^{15}\\text{NO}^+$ is the electrophile that nitrosates aniline.\n\nAniline, $C_6H_5\\text{NH}_2$, provides its amine nitrogen lone pair to attack $^{15}\\text{NO}^+$, giving an $N$-nitrosamine intermediate of the form $C_6H_5\\text{NH-}^{15}\\text{N=O}$; the $^{15}\\text{N}$ resides on the nitroso nitrogen.

It does not scramble to the dimethylamino substituent nitrogen, and it is not lost during the sequence.\n\nConsequently, the correct choice is that the labeled nitrogen is the azo nitrogen bound to the $N,N$-dimethylaniline-derived ring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2156392"}, {"introduction": "While we learn general rules for reactions, chemistry is full of fascinating exceptions that deepen our understanding. This problem [@problem_id:2156401] explores what happens when a standard azo coupling is blocked by severe steric hindrance. You will analyze how this steric clash shuts down the expected pathway and favors an alternative, single-electron transfer mechanism, leading to a completely different but mechanistically interesting product.", "problem": "An organic chemistry student attempts to perform an azo coupling reaction to synthesize a new dye. The student prepares an ice-cold aqueous solution of benzenediazonium chloride, which serves as the electrophile. For the coupling partner, the student uses 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol dissolved in a suitable solvent, maintaining the reaction mixture at a temperature between 0 and 5 degrees Celsius and a pH of approximately 8.\n\nThe student expects to see the formation of a brightly colored precipitate, the azo dye, resulting from an electrophilic aromatic substitution. However, upon workup and analysis, it is found that the standard azo coupling product is not the major species formed. Instead, a different principal organic product derived from the 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol starting material is isolated.\n\nFrom the choices below, identify the major organic product that is actually formed from the 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol under these conditions.\n\nA. 4-(Phenyldiazenyl)-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol\n\nB. 2-(Phenyldiazenyl)-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol\n\nC. 3,3',5,5'-Tetra-tert-butyldiphenoquinone\n\nD. Benzene\n\nE. No reaction occurs, and 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol is recovered unchanged.", "solution": "The key mechanistic expectation in azo coupling is electrophilic aromatic substitution of an aryldiazonium salt onto an activated aromatic ring. A phenol is a strong ortho/para director: under mildly basic conditions (pH about 8), partial deprotonation to the phenoxide increases ring nucleophilicity, and coupling typically occurs at the para position to give a para-azo product.\n\nHowever, with 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, steric effects dominate:\n1) The ortho positions are occupied by tert-butyl groups, so ortho coupling is precluded.\n2) The para position is flanked by two bulky tert-butyl groups at the 2 and 6 positions, which imposes severe steric hindrance to approach and planar alignment of the benzenediazonium electrophile necessary for electrophilic aromatic substitution. This greatly suppresses the rate of azo coupling that would give 4-(phenyldiazenyl)-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol.\n\nConcurrently, under the same mildly basic, cold conditions, benzenediazonium salts can serve as one-electron oxidants toward phenoxides. Specifically:\n3) At pH approximately 8, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol is partially converted to its phenoxide, a good single-electron donor.\n4) Single-electron transfer from the phenoxide to the diazonium cation generates a phenoxyl radical and reduces the diazonium, with loss of nitrogen. The hindered 2,6-di-tert-butylphenoxyl radical is unusually stabilized due to steric protection and resonance.\n5) Two such stabilized phenoxyl radicals couple at their least hindered positions, which are the para carbons, forming a C–C bond between the aromatic rings.\n6) Subsequent oxidation under the reaction conditions (the diazonium salt and dissolved oxygen both serve as oxidants) converts the coupled dihydroxy biphenyl intermediate to the corresponding diphenoquinone. For 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, this gives 3,3',5,5'-tetra-tert-butyldiphenoquinone as the principal product.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A (para-azo) is disfavored by severe steric hindrance and loses to the faster radical oxidation pathway.\n- Option B (ortho-azo) is blocked by tert-butyl substituents.\n- Option D (benzene) is unrelated to the observed transformation.\n- Option E (no reaction) is incorrect because oxidation and coupling occur readily for this hindered phenol under these conditions.\n\nThe major product is 3,3',5,5'-tetra-tert-butyldiphenoquinone, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2156401"}]}
