{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Five-membered aromatic heterocycles like furan, thiophene, and pyrrole are considered \"electron-rich\" because the heteroatom contributes a lone pair of electrons to the $\\pi$-system. This makes them highly activated towards electrophilic aromatic substitution, even more so than benzene. This first practice problem challenges you to predict the outcome of a classic electrophilic substitution on thiophene, requiring you to consider the stability of the possible cationic intermediates to determine the major product.

When thiophene is treated with fuming sulfuric acid at a moderate temperature, a facile electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction occurs. Predict the chemical structure of the major monosubstitution product formed in this reaction from the options provided below.\n\nA. Thiophene-2-sulfonic acid\nB. Thiophene-3-sulfonic acid\nC. Thiophene-2,5-disulfonic acid\nD. 2,3-Dihydrothiophene-2-sulfonic acid\nE. No reaction occurs", "solution": "Electrophilic aromatic substitution is favored on thiophene because it is aromatic with a six-electron delocalized system that satisfies Hückel’s rule, $4n+2$ with $n=1$. The aromatic sextet consists of four electrons from the two C=C bonds and two electrons from a sulfur lone pair in a $p$ orbital.\n\nFuming sulfuric acid generates a very strong electrophile (sulfur trioxide and its protonated forms), so sulfonation proceeds readily by the standard electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism: attack of the ring on the electrophile to form a $\\sigma$-complex (arenium ion), followed by deprotonation to restore aromaticity.\n\nRegioselectivity in thiophene EAS strongly favors substitution at the 2-position (alpha) over the 3-position (beta). This preference is explained by the relative stabilization of the $\\sigma$-complexes:\n- For attack at C-2, the resulting cationic intermediate can delocalize the positive charge over two carbons and onto sulfur, providing more and better-stabilized resonance structures (including one with positive charge on sulfur, which is stabilized by sulfur’s ability to bear positive charge and by overlap with its lone pairs).\n- For attack at C-3, delocalization does not place positive charge on sulfur in an equivalently stabilizing way and leads to fewer stabilizing resonance contributors; thus, the $\\sigma$-complex is less stabilized.\n\nTherefore, kinetic control strongly favors substitution at C-2, leading to thiophene-2-sulfonic acid as the major product under moderate conditions. Under harsher conditions, disulfonation at 2,5 can occur, but at moderate temperature monosulfonation predominates. The options proposing 3-substitution, disulfonation, or loss of aromaticity (dihydrothiophene) are inconsistent with the mechanism and conditions, and “no reaction” is incorrect because thiophene is more reactive than benzene toward EAS.\n\nHence, the major monosubstitution product is thiophene-2-sulfonic acid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2194938"}, {"introduction": "While electron-rich heterocycles are excellent substrates for electrophilic substitution, their high reactivity can also be a liability under certain conditions. The strong Lewis or Brønsted acids used to generate electrophiles in reactions like the Friedel-Crafts alkylation can interact with the sensitive heterocycle in unintended ways. This next exercise presents a common experimental failure—the polymerization of pyrrole—and asks you to deduce the underlying chemical principle that explains why the expected product is not formed. [@problem_id:2194947]", "problem": "An undergraduate student attempts to synthesize 2-tert-butylpyrrole via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction. The student combines pyrrole with 2-chloro-2-methylpropane (tert-butyl chloride) in the presence of a catalytic amount of anhydrous aluminum chloride ($AlCl_3$). Instead of isolating the expected liquid product, the student observes the rapid formation of a dark, insoluble, tar-like solid, and the starting materials are consumed.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental chemical explanation for this experimental outcome?\n\nA. The highly electron-rich pyrrole ring is protonated or complexed by the strong Lewis acid, generating an electrophilic pyrrolium cation. This cation is subsequently attacked by a neutral pyrrole molecule, initiating a chain-reaction polymerization.\n\nB. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom of pyrrole is significantly more nucleophilic than the aromatic pi system. This leads exclusively to N-alkylation, forming an unstable N-tert-butylpyrrolium salt that rapidly decomposes to form the observed tar.\n\nC. The tert-butyl carbocation generated from 2-chloro-2-methylpropane is too sterically hindered to attack the carbons of the five-membered pyrrole ring, causing the unreacted carbocations to undergo side reactions and decomposition.\n\nD. The nitrogen atom of pyrrole acts as a potent Lewis base, forming an irreversible adduct with the aluminum chloride catalyst. This complexation deactivates the catalyst entirely, preventing the reaction and causing the reagents to decompose under the thermal conditions.\n\nE. The strong Lewis acid induces the cleavage and opening of the pyrrole ring. The resulting acyclic amine and alkene fragments then undergo a random, acid-catalyzed polymerization.", "solution": "We analyze the behavior of pyrrole under strongly Lewis acidic Friedel-Crafts alkylation conditions. The intended mechanism for Friedel-Crafts alkylation involves generation of a carbocationic electrophile and electrophilic aromatic substitution at the most activated position of the arene. However, pyrrole is an exceptionally electron-rich, acid-sensitive heteroaromatic, and strong Lewis or Brønsted acids fundamentally alter its reactivity.\n\nFirst, the strong Lewis acid, such as anhydrous aluminum chloride, coordinates to the lone pair on the pyrrole nitrogen or effects protonation in situ via trace acid generated from halide abstraction. In either case, this produces a pyrrolium-type cation in which the positive charge is delocalized into the ring. Expressed schematically, one can write that Lewis acid coordination satisfies\n$$\\text{pyrrole} + \\mathrm{AlCl_{3}} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{pyrrole}\\cdot \\mathrm{AlCl_{3}},$$\nwhich is equivalent in resonance terms to a pyrrolium cation with the positive charge distributed on the ring, especially at the 2- and 5-positions. Alternatively, protonation gives $\\text{pyrroleH}^{+}$, which is also a pyrrolium cation in resonance form. In both cases, the ring becomes electrophilic at the 2-position.\n\nSecond, neutral pyrrole molecules in the reaction mixture remain strongly nucleophilic at the 2-position. The electrophilic pyrrolium species thus undergoes nucleophilic attack by neutral pyrrole at C-2, forming a C–C bond and generating a new cationic intermediate. Subsequent deprotonation restores aromaticity, but in the persistent presence of the Lewis acid, further protonation or complexation regenerates electrophilic sites. This sequence repeats, enabling chain-growth oligomerization and ultimately polymerization. The macroscopic consequence is rapid formation of a dark, insoluble, tar-like material (polypyrrole-like material and related oligomers), while consuming starting materials.\n\nThis outcome is the most fundamental chemical explanation for the observation: the acid-activated, electrophilic pyrrolium intermediates initiate self-condensation/polymerization of pyrrole rather than giving a clean, discrete Friedel-Crafts tert-butylation product under these harsh conditions.\n\nRuling out the alternatives:\n- N-alkylation (B) is disfavored for pyrrole because direct N-alkylation compromises aromaticity in the intermediate and, under these conditions, the nitrogen is already tied up by strong Lewis acid coordination or protonation; such a specific unstable N-tert-butylpyrrolium pathway is not the principal cause of tar.\n- Steric hindrance of the tert-butyl cation (C) does not preclude electrophilic substitution on a highly activated five-membered ring; more importantly, the dominant pathway is acid-induced self-polymerization, not lack of attack due to sterics.\n- Complete irreversible deactivation of $\\mathrm{AlCl_{3}}$ (D) is inconsistent with the observed rapid consumption of starting materials and tar formation; Lewis acid binding activates pyrrole toward electrophilic polymerization rather than shutting the system down.\n- Ring opening (E) of pyrrole under these conditions is not the canonical pathway; acid-promoted ring opening is not the principal mechanistic route to the observed tar.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that acid activation of pyrrole to a pyrrolium cation triggers electrophilic self-condensation and polymerization.\n\nThe correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2194947"}, {"introduction": "In stark contrast to the electron-rich five-membered heterocycles, pyridine is an \"electron-deficient\" aromatic system due to the pull of its electronegative nitrogen atom. This fundamental electronic difference flips its characteristic reactivity; instead of reacting with electrophiles, pyridine is susceptible to attack by strong nucleophiles. This final problem explores this alternate reaction pathway, asking you to identify the initial adduct formed when pyridine reacts with a potent organometallic nucleophile, a reaction that highlights a core feature of six-membered N-heterocyclic chemistry.

This property allows it to react with strong nucleophiles, a reaction pathway not typically observed for electron-rich aromatic systems like benzene. Consider the reaction of pyridine with one equivalent of methyllithium ($CH_{3}Li$) in an aprotic solvent. This reaction forms a stable anionic intermediate, which is the initial adduct before any subsequent workup step.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions best represents the major anionic intermediate formed in this reaction?\n\nA. An intermediate formed by the addition of the methyl group to the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring, placing a negative charge on the nitrogen.\nB.

Strong nucleophiles can therefore undergo nucleophilic addition to pyridine at these positions to give nonaromatic, anionic sigma-adducts (Meisenheimer-type intermediates) in which the negative charge is delocalized onto the ring and especially onto the nitrogen atom.\n\nMethyllithium provides a strongly nucleophilic methyl anion equivalent, and in an aprotic solvent the lithium cation can coordinate to the pyridine nitrogen. This coordination both activates the ring toward nucleophilic attack and directs attack to the 2-position (ortho) by chelation control, facilitating a 1,2-addition pathway. The resulting sigma-adduct is the 1-aza-2-methyl-cyclohexa-3,5-dienyl anion (a 1,2-dihydropyridyl anion), in which the negative charge is delocalized and can be represented in resonance forms that place negative charge on nitrogen, providing extra stabilization.\n\nAssessing the options:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because nucleophilic attack at nitrogen is disfavored; the nitrogen is the locus of electron density, and methyl anion is not an electrophile that would alkylate nitrogen. Moreover, N-alkylation would generate a pyridinium cation, not an anion.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because it describes deprotonation at C2 by methyl anion and an anion named as if N were methylated; methyllithium is not an electrophile to N-methylate, and simple deprotonation at C2 of unsubstituted pyridine is not the dominant process under these conditions relative to nucleophilic addition. The described species does not match the known initial sigma-adduct of nucleophilic addition.\n\n- Option C corresponds to 4-addition (para). While nucleophilic addition at C4 is possible, the major adduct with organolithiums in aprotic media is typically the 2-addition product due to stronger stabilization and Li^{+} coordination to nitrogen during attack.\n\n- Option D (3-addition, meta) is disfavored because the LUMO coefficient at C3 is small and the resulting anion is less effectively stabilized by resonance with nitrogen.\n\n- Option E corresponds to 2-addition (ortho), yielding the 1-aza-2-methyl-cyclohexa-3,5-dienyl anion, the well-established Meisenheimer-type adduct for nucleophilic addition of strong carbanions to pyridine under these conditions, and is therefore the best representation of the major anionic intermediate.\n\nHence, the best choice is addition at C2, described in option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2194969"}]}
