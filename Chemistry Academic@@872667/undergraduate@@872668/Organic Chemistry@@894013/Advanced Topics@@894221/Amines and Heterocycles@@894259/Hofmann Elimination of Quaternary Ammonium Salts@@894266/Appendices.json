This first exercise focuses on the core principle behind the \"Hofmann rule.\" By analyzing a substrate with two distinct sites for elimination, you'll pinpoint not just the major product, but more importantly, the reason for its preference, which is rooted in steric interactions within the E2 transition state [@problem_id:2174940].", "problem": "A chemist treats N,N,N-trimethyl-sec-butylammonium hydroxide with heat. This process, known as the Hofmann elimination, results in the formation of an alkene, trimethylamine, and water. Two different alkenes can potentially form from this reaction. Based on the principles governing this type of elimination reaction, which of the following statements correctly identifies the major alkene product and the primary reason for its preferential formation?\n\nA. The major product is but-1-ene. The reaction is regioselective because the base abstracts a proton from the most sterically accessible beta-carbon.\n\nB. The major product is but-2-ene. The reaction is regioselective because it proceeds through the most stable carbocation intermediate.\n\nC. The major product is but-2-ene. The reaction is regioselective because it forms the more thermodynamically stable, more substituted alkene.\n\nD. The major product is but-1-ene. The reaction is regioselective because the base abstracts the most acidic beta-proton.\n\nE. The reaction produces equal amounts of but-1-ene and but-2-ene because both types of beta-protons are equally reactive.", "solution": "1) Identify the reaction type and mechanism. Heating a quaternary ammonium hydroxide (here, N,N,N-trimethyl-sec-butylammonium hydroxide) gives a Hofmann elimination. This proceeds via a concerted E2 mechanism: a base abstracts a beta-hydrogen anti-periplanar to the C–N bond while the leaving group departs, forming an alkene. There is no carbocation intermediate in an E2 mechanism.\n\n2) Determine possible alkenes. The alpha-carbon is the secondary carbon bearing the ammonium group. There are two distinct beta-carbons:\n- The methyl beta-carbon, whose deprotonation leads to but-1-ene.\n- The methylene beta-carbon on the ethyl side, whose deprotonation leads to but-2-ene.\n\n3) Apply Hofmann selectivity. Hofmann eliminations are known to be regioselective for the less substituted alkene (the Hofmann product), due primarily to steric effects: the bulky leaving group (trialkylammonium) and the base preferentially abstract a proton from the less hindered beta-carbon.\n\n4) Identify the major product and justify. Abstraction from the less hindered methyl beta-carbon is favored, giving the less substituted alkene, but-1-ene, as the major product. This selectivity is not governed by carbocation stability (none forms in E2) nor by intrinsic acidity of the beta-protons, but by steric accessibility in the E2 transition state.\n\n5) Match to the options. The correct statement is that the major product is but-1-ene and the regioselectivity arises because the base abstracts a proton from the most sterically accessible beta-carbon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2174940"}, {"introduction": "A common pitfall in organic chemistry is attempting to apply a reaction under conditions where it is mechanistically impossible.

The student's goal is to perform a Hofmann elimination by heating Compound A, expecting to form an alkene and trimethylamine. However, upon heating, the student observes that no alkene is formed, and the starting material is consumed through a different pathway. Which of the following statements provides the fundamental chemical reason for the failure of Compound A to undergo Hofmann elimination?\n\nA. The quaternary nitrogen atom, along with its three methyl substituents, is too sterically hindered to function as an effective leaving group.\n\nB. Nucleophilic substitution on a methyl group to form methanol is a kinetically more favored pathway than any possible elimination reaction.\n\nC. None of the alkyl groups attached to the central nitrogen atom possess a hydrogen atom on a beta-carbon.\n\nD. The potential alkene product, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, is energetically unfavorable to form due to high torsional strain.\n\nE. The hydroxide ion ($OH^−$) is not a sufficiently strong base to initiate an E2 elimination with a quaternary ammonium salt; a bulkier base like potassium tert-butoxide is required.", "solution": "Hofmann elimination of a quaternary ammonium hydroxide proceeds by an E2 mechanism in which a base, typically $OH^-$, abstracts a hydrogen from a $\\beta$-carbon while the trialkylamine leaves, forming an alkene and a tertiary amine. The necessary mechanistic requirement is the presence of at least one $\\beta$-hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the $\\alpha$-carbon (the carbon directly bonded to the nitrogen).\n\nCompound A is $\\mathrm{N,N,N}$-trimethyl-(2,2-dimethylpropyl)ammonium hydroxide. The 2,2-dimethylpropyl group is the neopentyl group, $(\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{CCH}_2-$. Thus, the nitrogen is bonded to three $\\text{Me}$ groups and one $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_3)_3$ group. The $\\alpha$-carbon of the neopentyl substituent is the $\\text{CH}_2$ directly attached to nitrogen. The only $\\beta$-carbon available from that chain is the adjacent carbon, which is the quaternary carbon $\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_3)_3$. A quaternary carbon has zero hydrogens, so there are no $\\beta$-hydrogens available on that side. For each $\\text{Me}$ substituent on nitrogen, there is no $\\beta$-carbon at all, since the substituent is only one carbon long. Therefore, the molecule has no $\\beta$-hydrogens anywhere, and E2 Hofmann elimination cannot occur.\n\nThis directly supports option C. The other options are not the fundamental reason: \n- A is incorrect because the leaving group in Hofmann elimination is a neutral tertiary amine, which is an excellent leaving group; steric hindrance at nitrogen does not prevent the E2 if a $\\beta$-hydrogen exists.\n- B is not the governing factor; nucleophilic substitution at a methyl carbon to give methanol from a quaternary ammonium salt is not the standard competing pathway and does not address the universal prerequisite for elimination.\n- D is incorrect because product strain is not the controlling factor; the reaction fails earlier due to absence of $\\beta$-hydrogens.\n- E is incorrect because $OH^-$ is sufficiently basic for Hofmann elimination of quaternary ammonium salts; a bulkier base is not required.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental reason is the complete absence of $\\beta$-hydrogens on any alkyl group attached to nitrogen.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2174904"}, {"introduction": "Beyond predicting products, the true power of a reaction lies in its application for synthesis and analysis. This final problem simulates a real-world structure elucidation task [@problem_id:2174947]. You are challenged to work backward from the observed products—an alkene and a tertiary amine—to deduce the complete structure of the original unknown amine, integrating all the principles of the Hofmann elimination into a cohesive problem-solving strategy.", "problem": "In a structural elucidation experiment, an unknown amine with the molecular formula C7H17N is subjected to a two-step reaction sequence. First, the amine is treated with an excess of methyl iodide in a process known as exhaustive methylation. The resulting quaternary ammonium iodide salt is then treated with silver(I) oxide and water, followed by heating. This final step, a Hofmann elimination, yields two major organic products: one is an alkene identified as pent-1-ene, and the other is a tertiary amine identified as N,N-dimethylethylamine.\n\nBased on these products, determine the structure of the original unknown amine.\n\nA. N-ethylpentan-1-amine\n\nB. N,N-dimethylpentan-1-amine\n\nC. N-ethyl-N-methylbutan-1-amine\n\nD. Heptan-3-amine\n\nE. N-ethylpentan-2-amine", "solution": "We analyze the Hofmann exhaustive methylation/elimination sequence mechanistically.\n\n1) Exhaustive methylation converts the unknown amine into a quaternary ammonium iodide. If the original amine bears substituents $R_{1}, R_{2}$ (and possibly $R_{3}$) on nitrogen, excess $CH_3I$ gives the quaternary salt with substituents filling to four groups on nitrogen. Subsequent treatment with $Ag_2O/H_2O$ generates the quaternary ammonium hydroxide.\n\n2) Hofmann elimination of a quaternary ammonium hydroxide proceeds by an $E2$ mechanism: a $\\beta$-hydrogen on one of the $N$-alkyl substituents is removed, the $C_{\\alpha}-N$ bond breaks, and the products are:\n- an alkene originating from the eliminated $N$-alkyl group,\n- a tertiary amine consisting of the other three $N$ substituents.\nThe regiochemistry is Hofmann: the least substituted alkene is favored.\n\n3) The experiment reports two major products: pent-1-ene and the tertiary amine N,N-dimethylethylamine. Therefore, in the quaternary ammonium hydroxide just before elimination, the three groups that remain on nitrogen (to give the tertiary amine) must be two methyls and one ethyl. Denote the fourth substituent by $R$. Thus the quaternary has $[N(\\text{Me})_2(\\text{Et})(R)]^+$, and elimination from $R$ yields the alkene. Because the alkene observed is pent-1-ene, $R$ must be a pentyl group.\n\n4) To match the observed single alkene pent-1-ene as the major alkene, $R$ must be $n$-pentyl attached at $C_{1}$. In that case, the only possible $E2$ elimination across the $C_{\\alpha}$–$C_{\\beta}$ bond of the $n$-pentyl substituent gives pent-1-ene exclusively as the Hofmann product. If instead $R$ were sec-pentyl (attachment at $C_{2}$), elimination could proceed either toward $C_{1}$ (giving pent-1-ene) or toward $C_{3}$ (giving pent-2-ene), typically producing multiple alkene products. The statement that the two major organic products are pent-1-ene and a tertiary amine indicates a single major alkene consistent with $R = n$-pentyl.\n\n5) Hence, before exhaustive methylation, the amine must have had $R = n$-pentyl and also an ethyl substituent on $N$ (so that, after adding two methyl groups, the quaternary is $[N(\\text{Me})_2(\\text{Et})(n\\text{-pentyl})]^+$). That starting structure is a secondary amine: N-ethylpentan-1-amine.\n\n6) Check the molecular formula: N-ethylpentan-1-amine has $C = 2 + 5 = 7$, and $H = 5$ (ethyl) $+ 11$ (pentyl) $+ 1$ (on $N$) $= 17$, giving $C_7H_{17}N$, which matches the given formula.\n\n7) Eliminate the other options:\n- B (N,N-dimethylpentan-1-amine) would give, after exhaustive methylation, $[N(\\text{Me})_3(n\\text{-pentyl})]^+$, leading to pent-1-ene and trimethylamine, not N,N-dimethylethylamine.\n- C (N-ethyl-N-methylbutan-1-amine) would lead to a butene, not pent-1-ene.\n- D (heptan-3-amine) would give a heptene and trimethylamine.\n- E (N-ethylpentan-2-amine) would place $R$ as sec-pentyl and typically give multiple alkenes (pent-1-ene and pent-2-ene), inconsistent with the description emphasizing pent-1-ene as the alkene product.\n\nTherefore, the original unknown amine is N-ethylpentan-1-amine.\n\nAnswer: A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2174947"}]}
