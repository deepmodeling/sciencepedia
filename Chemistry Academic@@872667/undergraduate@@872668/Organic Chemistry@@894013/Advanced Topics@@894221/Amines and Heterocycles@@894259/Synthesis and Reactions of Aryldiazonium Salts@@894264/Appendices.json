Let $Ar$ denote the $p$-sulfophenyl ring ($C_{6}H_{4}$ bearing $SO_{3}H$ para to the diazonium site).

This invokes the Sandmeyer reaction, in which an aryldiazonium ion is substituted by bromide under catalysis or mediation by $CuBr$, expelling nitrogen gas.

However, the diazonium cation is a relatively weak electrophile, and successful coupling requires a highly activated aromatic partner. This practice [@problem_id:2206513] explores how reaction conditions, specifically pH, critically determine the reactivity of potential coupling partners, forcing a choice between two classic activated rings, aniline and phenol.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with synthesizing an azo dye via an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The student prepares a solution of benzenediazonium chloride ($C_6H_5N_2^+ Cl^-$) in water, buffered to a pH of 2.0. To complete the synthesis, the student must add a \"coupling partner\" to the diazonium salt solution.

Aniline, because the amino group is a powerful activating group that directs ortho-para substitution.\n\nB. Phenol, because the hydroxyl group remains a strong activating group in the acidic environment.\n\nC. Aniline, because the acidic conditions protonate the diazonium salt, making it more reactive.\n\nD. Nitrobenzene, because its electron-withdrawing nature complements the electrophilic character of the diazonium salt.\n\nE. Phenol, because it is readily deprotonated to the highly reactive phenoxide ion in the acidic solution.", "solution": "The coupling of an aryl diazonium ion with an aromatic ring is an electrophilic aromatic substitution in which the electrophile is the aryl diazonium cation $ArN_{2}^{+}$, and the rate is governed by the nucleophilicity (electron density) of the aromatic partner. Electron-donating substituents activate the ring and direct to ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing substituents deactivate the ring and retard the reaction.\n\nAt $pH=2.0$, acid–base equilibria determine the form and hence the directing/activating power of substituents:\n- For aniline, the relevant equilibrium is $PhNH_{2} + H^{+} \\rightleftharpoons PhNH_{3}^{+}$. By the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation for a conjugate acid–base pair,\n$$\n\\frac{[PhNH_{2}]}{[PhNH_{3}^{+}]} = 10^{pH - pK_{a}(PhNH_{3}^{+})}.\n$$\nSince $pH < pK_{a}(PhNH_{3}^{+})$, it follows that $[PhNH_{2}]/[PhNH_{3}^{+}] \\ll 1$, so aniline is predominantly present as $PhNH_{3}^{+}$. The $PhNH_{3}^{+}$ group is not able to donate its lone pair into the ring and is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, making coupling slow to negligible. Therefore, options asserting aniline is best (A and C) fail; moreover, the claim in C about “protonating the diazonium salt” is not pertinent because the electrophile $ArN_{2}^{+}$ is already a cation and further protonation is not the controlling factor for rate.\n- For phenol, the relevant equilibrium is $PhOH \\rightleftharpoons PhO^{-} + H^{+}$. The Henderson–Hasselbalch relation gives\n$$\n\\frac{[PhO^{-}]}{[PhOH]} = 10^{pH - pK_{a}(PhOH)}.\n$$\nSince $pH \\ll pK_{a}(PhOH)$, we have $[PhO^{-}]/[PhOH] \\ll 1$, so phenol remains largely as neutral $PhOH$, not as $PhO^{-}$. This directly contradicts option E. However, even as $PhOH$, the hydroxyl group donates electron density to the ring by resonance, remaining an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent that promotes azo coupling. Thus, phenol is a good coupling partner under these acidic conditions, supporting option B.\n- Nitrobenzene bears a strongly electron-withdrawing $NO_{2}$ group that deactivates the ring and directs meta; it is a poor substrate for electrophilic aromatic substitution, so D is incorrect.\n\nAmong the given choices, the only substrate that remains activated under $pH=2.0$ and is therefore effective for rapid azo coupling is phenol, and the correct reasoning is that its hydroxyl group continues to activate the ring in this acidic environment, not that it is deprotonated to phenoxide under these conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2206513"}, {"introduction": "In practical synthesis, maximizing the yield of a desired product often means minimizing competing side reactions.
