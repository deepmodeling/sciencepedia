In an aqueous solution, D-glucose exists in equilibrium between its cyclic forms and its open-chain form. The dominant cyclic form is a pyranose ring, which is a cyclic hemiacetal. A key characteristic of a hemiacetal is that this cyclic structure can reversibly open to form the corresponding aldehyde and alcohol. For D-glucose, this equilibrium means a small but significant concentration of the open-chain form, which possesses a free aldehyde group ($-\\text{CHO}$) at the C1 carbon, is always present.\n\n$$\n\\text{Cyclic hemiacetal (D-glucose)} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Open-chain aldehyde form}\n$$\n\nTollens' reagent, $[Ag(NH_{3})_{2}]^{+}$, is a mild oxidizing agent. Its specific function is to oxidize aldehydes to carboxylate ions. During this redox reaction, the silver(I) ions ($Ag^{+}$) in the complex are reduced to elemental silver ($Ag(s)$), which then plates out on the glass surface as a reflective silver mirror.\n\n$$\n\\text{R-CHO} + 2[Ag(NH_{3})_{2}]^{+} + 3OH^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{R-COO}^{-} + 2Ag(s) + 4NH_{3} + 2H_{2}O\n$$\n\nSince Sample A (D-glucose) exists in equilibrium with its open-chain aldehyde form, it will react positively with Tollens' reagent. As the aldehyde form is consumed by the reaction, Le Châtelier's principle dictates that the equilibrium will shift from the cyclic hemiacetal form to the open-chain form to replenish the aldehyde, allowing the reaction to proceed until a visible silver mirror is formed. Sugars that give a positive test with Tollens' reagent are known as reducing sugars.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of methyl $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranoside (Sample B). This molecule is formed when the anomeric hydroxyl group ($-\\text{OH}$) on the C1 carbon of D-glucose is replaced by a methoxy group ($-\\text{OCH}_{3}$). This creates a glycosidic bond. The resulting functional group at the anomeric carbon is an acetal, not a hemiacetal.\n\nUnlike hemiacetals, acetals are stable in neutral or basic solutions (the conditions of the Tollens' test). The acetal linkage does not spontaneously open to form an aldehyde. Therefore, methyl $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranoside cannot provide a free aldehyde group to be oxidized by the Tollens' reagent. Consequently, no reaction will occur, and no silver mirror will be observed. Sugars like this are known as non-reducing sugars.\n\nTherefore, the expected observation that confirms the successful conversion is that Sample A (D-glucose) will give a positive test (silver mirror), while Sample B (methyl $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranoside) will give a negative test (no silver mirror).\n\nAnalyzing the choices:\nA. Incorrect. Sample B, the acetal, will not react.\nB. Incorrect. Sample A, the hemiacetal, will react.\nC. Correct. Sample A (hemiacetal) reacts, but Sample B (acetal) does not.\nD. Incorrect. This reverses the expected reactivity.\nE. Incorrect.

Real-world starting materials often possess multiple reactive functional groups, and targeting just one requires a careful strategy. This problem challenges you to design a multi-step synthesis of a specific glycoside from D-glucuronic acid, a starting material with a competing carboxylic acid group. Devising an effective plan will test your ability to integrate the principles of glycoside formation with the strategic use of protecting groups to achieve a desired chemical outcome [@problem_id:2173481].", "problem": "A bio-organic chemist is planning the synthesis of ethyl D-glucopyranosiduronic acid, a molecule used as a substrate in enzymatic assays. The readily available starting material is D-glucuronic acid. A preliminary experiment reveals that a direct reaction of D-glucuronic acid with ethanol (EtOH) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), results in a low yield of the desired product. The reaction is non-selective and produces a significant amount of an undesired byproduct arising from the esterification of the C6 carboxylic acid. To achieve a successful synthesis, a chemoselective, multi-step strategy must be employed.\n\nConsidering the functional groups present in D-glucuronic acid (a C1 anomeric hydroxyl, secondary hydroxyls, and a C6 carboxylic acid), which of the following two-step sequences represents the most effective and standard chemical strategy to synthesize ethyl D-glucopyranosiduronic acid while preventing the competing esterification reaction at the C6 position?\n\nA. Step 1: React D-glucuronic acid with a large excess of ethanol and a catalytic amount of hydrochloric acid to allow both reactions to proceed. Step 2: Separate the product mixture and selectively hydrolyze the undesired C6 ethyl ester using dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide, followed by a final neutralization step.\n\nB. Step 1: Protect all four hydroxyl groups by reacting D-glucuronic acid with excess acetic anhydride in pyridine. Step 2: React the resulting per-acetylated product with ethanol and an acid catalyst to form the ethyl glycoside at the C1 position, followed by deacetylation.\n\nC. Step 1: Selectively reduce the C6 carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol using a mild and selective reducing agent like a borane-tetrahydrofuran complex (BH3-THF). Step 2: Perform a standard Fischer glycosidation on the resulting sugar using ethanol and an acid catalyst.\n\nD. Step 1: Convert D-glucuronic acid to its stable intramolecular ester (a lactone), specifically D-glucurono-6,3-lactone, by gentle heating, often facilitated by a trace of acid. Step 2: React this lactone with ethanol and an acid catalyst to form the ethyl glycoside at the anomeric center, followed by mild basic hydrolysis to open the lactone ring.\n\nE. Step 1: Convert the C6 carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride using thionyl chloride (SOCl2). Step 2: Immediately react the highly reactive intermediate with ethanol in a non-nucleophilic basic medium to form the ethyl glycoside.", "solution": "Identify the functional groups and the selectivity challenge: D-glucuronic acid has an anomeric hydroxyl at C1, three additional secondary hydroxyls, and a C6 carboxylic acid. The target, ethyl D-glucopyranosiduronic acid, requires formation of an ethyl glycoside at C1 while retaining the C6 as a free carboxylic acid. Under standard Fischer glycosylation conditions (ethanol and a strong acid), two competitive acid-catalyzed reactions occur: (i) glycosidation at C1 via oxocarbenium formation and capture by ethanol, and (ii) Fischer esterification of the C6 carboxylic acid with ethanol. Direct treatment thus gives low yields due to nonselective esterification at C6.\n\nDefine the chemoselective protection principle: To prevent C6 esterification while enabling C1 glycosidation, the C6 carboxylic acid must be masked in a way that is stable to the acid used for glycosidation but readily deprotected under conditions that do not cleave the glycoside. An intramolecular ester (lactone) formed from the C6 carboxyl and a vicinal hydroxyl fulfills this: it blocks intermolecular esterification with ethanol and is stable to the acidic conditions required for C1 glycosidation, yet can be hydrolyzed under mild basic conditions that leave the glycosidic acetal intact.\n\nApply this to glucuronic acid: D-glucuronic acid readily forms the lactone (commonly D-glucurono-6,3-lactone) by gentle heating, often with trace acid, which masks the C6 carboxyl as an internal ester. With the carboxyl group protected as a lactone, subsequent treatment with ethanol and an acid catalyst can form the ethyl glycoside selectively at the anomeric center via an oxocarbenium intermediate, without competing formation of the C6 ethyl ester. Finally, mild basic hydrolysis opens the lactone to regenerate the free C6 carboxylate, while the ethyl glycoside (an acetal) remains intact because acetals are stable under basic conditions but labile under acid.\n\nEvaluate each option against these principles:\n- Option A relies on nonselective initial formation of both products followed by selective hydrolysis of the C6 ethyl ester with base. Although glycosides are generally stable to base, this approach is inefficient and nonstandard due to the initial low selectivity and mixture complexity; it does not prevent the competing esterification.\n- Option B peracetylates hydroxyl groups, which blocks the anomeric hydroxyl and hinders standard Fischer glycosylation; moreover, the C6 carboxyl remains free and susceptible to esterification under acidic ethanol. This does not address the key selectivity issue and is not a standard two-step path to the target.\n- Option C reduces the C6 carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol, destroying the uronic acid functionality that must be present in the product; it cannot furnish the target without additional nontrivial steps to reoxidize the primary alcohol selectively, so it is incorrect.\n- Option D converts the carboxyl group into a lactone, preventing intermolecular esterification, then performs acid-catalyzed glycosidation with ethanol at C1, and finally opens the lactone under mild base to restore the C6 acid. This is the standard, chemoselective, and effective strategy.\n- Option E activates the acid as an acyl chloride, which will react rapidly with ethanol to make the ethyl ester at C6; furthermore, glycosidation requires acid catalysis, incompatible with the proposed basic conditions. This is the wrong direction.\n\nTherefore, the most effective and standard two-step sequence is to form the D-glucurono-6,3-lactone, perform the acid-catalyzed ethanol glycosidation at C1, and then hydrolyze the lactone under mild basic conditions to regenerate the free C6 carboxyl group.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2173481"}]}
