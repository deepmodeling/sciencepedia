By working through this problem, you will develop the ability to visualize these 3D structures and identify which isomer can achieve the ideal, low-energy diequatorial state. [@problem_id:2161744]", "problem": "In the study of conformational analysis, the stability of substituted cyclohexanes is a key concept. The most stable chair conformation of a substituted cyclohexane is typically the one that minimizes steric strain, particularly unfavorable 1,3-diaxial interactions where an axial substituent interacts with axial hydrogens on carbons three positions away. Consider the two stereoisomers of 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane. One of these isomers is uniquely capable of undergoing a ring flip to adopt a chair conformation in which both chlorine substituents occupy equatorial positions, thereby completely avoiding any 1,3-diaxial interactions involving the chloro groups.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the isomer that can exist in a conformation with no axial substituents?\n\nA. *cis*-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane\n\nB. *trans*-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane\n\nC. Both *cis*-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane and *trans*-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.\n\nD. Neither *cis*-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane nor *trans*-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane.", "solution": "Goal: Identify which 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane stereoisomer can adopt a chair conformation in which both chloro substituents are equatorial (hence no axial substituents and no 1,3-diaxial interactions).\n\nPrinciples used:\n- In a cyclohexane chair, each carbon bears one axial and one equatorial substituent. Axial positions alternate up and down around the ring; equatorial positions also alternate up and down.\n- Steric strain from 1,3-diaxial interactions occurs only for axial substituents; equatorial substituents avoid these interactions.\n- A ring flip interconverts axial and equatorial positions at each carbon while preserving the relative stereochemistry (cis or trans) between substituents.\n\nAnalysis for 1,2-disubstitution:\n- For substituents on adjacent carbons (1,2-relationship), the equatorial orientations on adjacent carbons are opposite in sense (one equatorial up, the next equatorial down). Therefore, a diequatorial 1,2-disubstitution must place one substituent up and the other down, which corresponds to a *trans* relationship.\n- Conversely, a *cis*-1,2 relationship (both substituents on the same face: both up or both down) cannot be achieved with both substituents equatorial on adjacent carbons, because adjacent equatorial positions are opposite in up/down sense. Thus, *cis*-1,2 in any chair conformation must have one substituent axial and the other equatorial; upon ring flip, they interconvert but remain one axial and one equatorial, never both equatorial.\n- For *trans*-1,2, one chair conformation allows both substituents to be equatorial (diequatorial, no axial substituents), while the ring-flipped chair makes both axial (diaxial).\n\nConclusion: Only *trans*-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane can adopt a chair conformation with both chloro substituents equatorial, eliminating all axial substituents and thus all 1,3-diaxial interactions involving the chloro groups.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2161744"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand which conformations are geometrically possible, the next step is to quantify their relative stabilities. This exercise moves from qualitative rules to a quantitative calculation of strain energy, a key skill in predicting molecular behavior. You will learn to determine the energy penalty of an unstable conformation by tallying the specific steric clashes—known as 1,3-diaxial interactions—that are the primary source of conformational strain.

The most stable arrangement for a cyclohexane ring is the chair conformation, which minimizes both angle strain and torsional strain.

Then:\n- For the diequatorial conformation:\n$$\nE_{\\text{eq}} = 0\n$$\nsince there are no 1,3-diaxial methyl-hydrogen interactions.\n- For the diaxial conformation, each axial methyl contributes two such interactions, and there are two methyl groups, so the total number of interactions is $4$. Therefore:\n$$\nE_{\\text{ax}} = 4 E_{\\text{Me-H}}.\n$$\n\nThe absolute difference in total strain energy between the less stable (diaxial) and the more stable (diequatorial) chair conformations is\n$$\n\\Delta E = |E_{\\text{ax}} - E_{\\text{eq}}| = 4 E_{\\text{Me-H}}.\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given value $E_{\\text{Me-H}} = 0.90 \\text{ kcal/mol}$,\n$$\n\\Delta E = 4 \\times 0.90 = 3.60 \\text{ kcal/mol}.\n$$\n\nRounded to two significant figures, this is $3.6 \\text{ kcal/mol}$.
