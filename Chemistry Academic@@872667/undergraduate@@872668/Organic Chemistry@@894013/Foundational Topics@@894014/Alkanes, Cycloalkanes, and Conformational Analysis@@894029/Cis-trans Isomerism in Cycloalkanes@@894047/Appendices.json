In 1,3-dimethylcyclopentane, both C1 and C3 are attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, and two different paths around the ring. Therefore, both C1 and C3 are stereogenic centers. With $n=2$ stereocenters, the maximum number of stereoisomers is $2^n = 2^2 = 4$.\n\nNext, we must analyze the cis and trans diastereomers for internal symmetry elements to determine if any are meso compounds.\n\n- ***cis*-1,3-Dimethylcyclopentane:** In this isomer, both methyl groups are on the same side of the ring (e.g., both \"up\"). A plane of symmetry can be drawn through C2 and bisecting the C4-C5 bond. This plane reflects C1 onto C3, and because both methyl groups are on the same side, the molecule is reflected onto itself. The presence of this internal mirror plane means that the *cis* isomer is achiral and is a meso compound. There is only one *cis* stereoisomer.\n\n- ***trans*-1,3-Dimethylcyclopentane:** In this isomer, the methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring (one \"up\", one \"down\"). This molecule does not possess any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is therefore chiral. It exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), corresponding to the (1R,3S) and (1S,3R) configurations.\n\nTherefore, the distinct stereoisomers are: one meso *cis* isomer and a pair of *trans* enantiomers.\n\nThe total number of stereoisomers is $N_{total} = 1 (\\text{cis}) + 2 (\\text{trans}) = 3$.\nThe number of chiral stereoisomers is $N_{chiral} = 2$ (the *trans* pair).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}3  2\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2160631"}, {"introduction": "While we can draw cis and trans isomers as static structures, many cycloalkanes are flexible and exist in a dynamic equilibrium of different three-dimensional shapes, or conformations. This exercise delves into the energetics of these conformations in substituted cyclohexanes, which is critical for understanding molecular stability. Using substituent-specific energy penalties known as A-values, you will quantitatively assess the preference for different arrangements and calculate the equilibrium constant between a molecule's two chair conformations, linking thermodynamic principles directly to molecular structure.

The molecule can exist in two interconverting chair conformations. The relative stability of these conformers is determined by the steric strain associated with the substituents.

The equilibrium constant then follows from the relation $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = - R T \\ln K_{eq}$.\n\nFor a 1,3-trans disubstituted cyclohexane, each chair conformation has one substituent axial and the other equatorial; a ring flip interconverts which substituent is axial.
