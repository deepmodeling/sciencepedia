To purify the crude product, the researcher attempts a recrystallization. Following a literature precedent for a similar compound, the researcher chooses Toluene as the solvent. A quantity of the crude solid is dissolved in a minimum amount of boiling Toluene (Boiling Point = 111 °C) to form a clear, saturated solution. However, upon allowing the flask to cool, the researcher is surprised to observe the formation of a dense, immiscible oil at the bottom of the flask instead of the desired solid crystals.

The compound's polarity is poorly matched with Toluene, leading to incomplete dissolution. The best remedy is to switch to Water, a highly polar solvent.", "solution": "Define the phenomenon: in recrystallization, if the solution becomes supersaturated at temperatures above the solute’s melting point, the solute can separate as a liquid phase rather than forming solid nuclei; this liquid phase appears as an immiscible oil (“oiling out”). A principal cause is using a solvent whose boiling point is higher than the solute’s melting point, so that during cooling the solution first reaches supersaturation while the temperature is still above the solute’s melting point, favoring liquid-phase separation.\n\nApply this to the given system: the compound has a sharp melting point near 95, while Toluene boils well above this temperature. Thus, when the hot saturated Toluene solution is cooled from its boiling point, it becomes supersaturated in a temperature range that is still above the compound’s melting point, favoring separation of a molten oil rather than crystalline nucleation. Therefore, the diagnosis that the solvent’s boiling point exceeds the solute’s melting point is correct; rapid cooling (as in option A) would typically aggravate oiling out, not cure it, and impurity-based melting point depression (option C) is not the primary cause given the clear match between boiling and melting temperatures.\n\nChoose the best remedy by solvent selection criteria: to avoid oiling out, select a solvent whose boiling point is below the solute’s melting point and which exhibits suitable hot-versus-cold solubility contrast for good recovery. From the table:\n- 95% Ethanol has a boiling point below the solute’s melting point and a favorable hot/cold solubility ratio with relatively lower cold solubility compared to Acetone, supporting higher recovery and good crystallization.\n- Acetone also has a boiling point below the solute’s melting point and an acceptable solubility contrast, but its cold solubility is higher than that in 95% Ethanol, implying greater loss to mother liquor.\n- Water is too poor a solvent at its boiling point to be practical, and Dichloromethane’s cold solubility is too high to permit crystallization.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate diagnosis is that Toluene’s boiling point exceeds the solute’s melting point, causing oiling out, and the best remedy from the provided options is to switch to 95% Ethanol for recrystallization.\n\nHence, option D is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2199834"}, {"introduction": "The power of liquid-liquid extraction is greatly enhanced when dealing with ionizable compounds like acids and bases, as their partitioning behavior can be controlled by adjusting pH.

The distribution coefficient is defined as the ratio of the total concentration of the compound (all species, ionized and neutral) in the organic phase to its total concentration in the aqueous phase.\n\nFor the weak acid, Acidiphen (HA), the equilibrium in the aqueous phase is $HA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$.

Thus, the expression for $D_A$ becomes:\n$$D_A = \\frac{K_{p,A}}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_{a,A}}}$$\n\nNext, for the weak base, Basophor (B), the equilibrium of its conjugate acid in the aqueous phase is $BH^+ \\rightleftharpoons B + H^+$. The neutral species, B, partitions according to $K_{p,B}$, while the charged species, $BH^+$, remains in the aqueous phase.\n\nThe distribution coefficient for the base, $D_B$, is:\n$$D_B = \\frac{[B]_{org}}{[B]_{aq} + [BH^+]_{aq}}$$\nUsing the acid dissociation constant for the conjugate acid, $K_a' = \\frac{[B][H^+]}{[BH^+]}$, we can write $[BH^+]_{aq} = \\frac{[B]_{aq}[H^+]}{K_a'}$.
