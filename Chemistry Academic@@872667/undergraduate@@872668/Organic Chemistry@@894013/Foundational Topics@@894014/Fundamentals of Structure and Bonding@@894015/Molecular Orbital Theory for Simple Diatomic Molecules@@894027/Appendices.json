In Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory, it is calculated using the formula:\n$$ \\text{Bond Order} = \\frac{1}{2} (N_b - N_a) $$\nwhere $N_b$ is the number of electrons in bonding molecular orbitals and $N_a$ is the number of electrons in antibonding molecular orbitals.\n\nThe given valence electron configuration is $(\\sigma_{2p})^2(\\pi_{2p})^4(\\pi_{2p}^*)^1(\\pi_{2p}^*)^1$.\n\nOrbitals without an asterisk (*) are bonding orbitals, and orbitals with an asterisk (*) are antibonding orbitals.\n\nFirst, we count the number of electrons in bonding orbitals ($N_b$):\n- The $\\sigma_{2p}$ orbital is a bonding orbital and contains 2 electrons.\n- The $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals are bonding orbitals and contain 4 electrons.\nSo, the total number of bonding electrons is:\n$$ N_b = 2 + 4 = 6 $$\n\nNext, we count the number of electrons in antibonding orbitals ($N_a$):\n- The $\\pi_{2p}^*$ orbitals are antibonding orbitals. The configuration shows one electron in each of the two degenerate $\\pi_{2p}^*$ orbitals.\nSo, the total number of antibonding electrons is:\n$$ N_a = 1 + 1 = 2 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the bond order:\n$$ \\text{Bond Order} = \\frac{1}{2} (N_b - N_a) = \\frac{1}{2} (6 - 2) = \\frac{1}{2} (4) = 2.0 $$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the magnetic properties.**\n\nThe magnetic property of a molecule is determined by the presence or absence of unpaired electrons.\n- If a molecule has one or more unpaired electrons, it is **paramagnetic**. It will be attracted to an external magnetic field.\n- If all electrons in a molecule are spin-paired, it is **diamagnetic**. It will be weakly repelled by an external magnetic field.\n\nThe problem states that the total spin angular momentum quantum number for this excited state is $S=0$. The total spin quantum number $S$ is related to the number of unpaired electrons, $n$, by the relationship $S = n/2$.\n\nGiven $S=0$, we can determine the number of unpaired electrons:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{n}{2} \\implies n = 0 $$\nThis means there are no unpaired electrons in the molecule. All electron spins are paired.\n\nThe configuration specifies that there are two electrons in the degenerate $\\pi_{2p}^*$ orbitals, one in each: $(\\pi_{2p}^*)^1(\\pi_{2p}^*)^1$. Since the total spin $S=0$, the spins of these two electrons must be opposite (one spin-up, $\\uparrow$, and one spin-down, $\\downarrow$). Therefore, despite being in different orbitals, their spins are paired, resulting in no net spin for the molecule.\n\nSince there are no unpaired electrons ($n=0$), the oxygen molecule in this excited state is **diamagnetic**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\n\nThe calculated bond order is 2.0, and the molecule is diamagnetic.
