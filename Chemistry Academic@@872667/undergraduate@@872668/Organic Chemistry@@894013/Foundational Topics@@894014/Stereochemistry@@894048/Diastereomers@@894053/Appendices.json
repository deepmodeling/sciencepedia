Thus, the molecule has two stereocenters, at C-2 and C-3. The given configuration is (2S,3R).\n\nFundamental stereochemical principle: For a molecule with two stereocenters,\n- Inverting both centers gives the enantiomer (non-superimposable mirror image).\n- Inverting exactly one center (keeping the other fixed) gives a diastereomer (stereoisomer that is not a mirror image).\n\nApply this to each option relative to (2S,3R):\n- A: (2R,3S) inverts both centers relative to (2S,3R), so it is the enantiomer, not a diastereomer.\n- B: (2R,3R) inverts C-2 while keeping C-3 the same; inversion at exactly one center yields a diastereomer.\n- C: (3R)-3-bromobutan-2-one differs in constitution (ketone instead of alcohol), so it is not a stereoisomer at all.\n- D: 2-bromo-3-butanol (nonstandard naming; intended as positional isomer with Br and OH swapped) differs in connectivity, so it is not a stereoisomer.\n- E: (2S,3R)-2-bromo-3-butanol also swaps the positions of Br and OH relative to the original; this changes constitution and is not a stereoisomer.\n\nTherefore, the compound that is a diastereomer of (2S,3R)-3-bromo-2-butanol is the one with exactly one center inverted, namely (2R,3R)-3-bromo-2-butanol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2166887"}, {"introduction": "Beyond abstract labels, chemists use specific diagrams to visualize the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms.

In a Fischer projection with the main chain vertical (C1 at top, C4 at bottom), horizontal substituents project toward the observer and vertical substituents project away. The mirror image of a Fischer projection is obtained by interchanging left and right at every stereocenter.\n\nDefinitions used:\n- Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images; for molecules with two stereocenters, they have opposite configuration at both centers.\n- Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not enantiomers; for molecules with two stereocenters, this occurs when the configuration differs at one center but not the other.\n- A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral; for 2,3-disubstituted butanes with identical substituents at C2 and C3, the RS and SR configurations are identical (meso).\n\nGiven the descriptions:\n- I: Br right at C2; Br right at C3.\n- II: Br left at C2; Br left at C3.\n- III: Br right at C2; Br left at C3.\n- IV: Br left at C2; Br left at C3 (this is identical to II; thus there are only three distinct molecules: I, II, III).\n\nMirror-image relationships in Fischer:\n- The mirror image of I (right,right) is II (left,left). Therefore, I and II are enantiomers, not diastereomers. This makes statement A false.\n- The mirror image of III (right,left) is left,right. For 2,3-dibromobutane, right,left and left,right correspond to RS and SR, which are identical due to an internal mirror plane (meso). Thus III is the meso isomer. Comparing II (the enantiomer of I) with III, they differ at only one of the two stereocenters, so they are diastereomers, not enantiomers. This makes statement B false.\n- I and III also differ at only one stereocenter, so they are diastereomers. However, II and III are also diastereomers, so the claim that I and III form the only diastereomeric pair is false. Therefore, statement C is false.\n- II and IV, as described, are identical, not constitutional isomers. Therefore, statement D is false.\n- Among the distinct molecules (I, II, III), the diastereomeric pairs are exactly two: (I,III) and (II,III).

This final practice ([@problem_id:2166860]) explores the practical implications of diastereoisomerism in the context of a chemical reaction. You will analyze a hypothetical experimental outcome to understand why diastereomers are often formed in unequal amounts, a principle that lies at the heart of stereoselective synthesis.", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is studying stereoselective reactions. The student starts with a pure sample of (S)-3-phenyl-2-butanone, a chiral ketone. This compound is treated with an excess of sodium borohydride ($\\text{NaBH}_4$), an achiral reducing agent, dissolved in methanol. After the reaction is complete and the products are isolated, analysis reveals that two stereoisomeric alcohols, designated as Compound X and Compound Y, have been formed in a 72:28 ratio.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best explanation for this experimental outcome?\n\nA. The products, X and Y, are enantiomers, and the unequal ratio arises because the reaction is thermodynamically controlled, favoring the more stable enantiomer.\nB. The products, X and Y, are diastereomers, and their formation proceeds through diastereomeric transition states of different energies.\nC. The products, X and Y, are enantiomers, and the non-50:50 ratio is the result of a kinetic resolution of the starting material.\nD. The products, X and Y, are constitutional isomers, not stereoisomers, and thus have different stabilities leading to unequal formation.\nE. The products, X and Y, are enantiomers, and any deviation from a 50:50 ratio must be attributed to contamination or experimental error, as reactions with achiral reagents must produce racemic mixtures.", "solution": "Identify the stereochemical elements of the substrate and products. The starting ketone, (S)-3-phenyl-2-butanone, has a pre-existing stereocenter at the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the carbon bearing phenyl, methyl, hydrogen, and the carbonyl substituent). Reduction of the carbonyl converts the carbonyl carbon into an alcohol-bearing stereocenter, creating a new stereocenter at that position. Under sodium borohydride in methanol, the existing stereocenter is not epimerized because the conditions are nonbasic enough to avoid enolization and there is no mechanism to racemize it; thus the configuration at the original stereocenter is retained.\n\nDetermine the relationship between the two observed products. Because the original stereocenter is preserved and a new stereocenter is formed at the former carbonyl carbon, the two products differ only at the newly formed stereocenter. Two stereoisomers that differ at one of two stereocenters are diastereomers, not enantiomers. Therefore, X and Y are diastereomeric alcohols.\n\nExplain why the ratio is unequal with an achiral reagent. Although the reagent and solvent are achiral, the chiral substrate creates a chiral environment for the approach of the hydride to the carbonyl. Hydride delivery to the two faces of the carbonyl occurs through two diastereomeric transition states with different steric and electronic environments (e.g., as rationalized by Felkin-Anh or Cram models for nucleophilic addition adjacent to a stereocenter). Diastereomeric transition states have different activation free energies, so the rates to each diastereomer differ. If $k_{\\text{major}}$ and $k_{\\text{minor}}$ are the rate constants to the two diastereomeric products, then their ratio relates to the difference in activation free energies by\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\text{major}}}{k_{\\text{minor}}}=\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{R T}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ is the difference between the activation free energies for the two pathways, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature. A nonunity ratio, such as 0.72 to 0.28, is thus expected.\n\nEvaluate the options:\nA is incorrect because X and Y are not enantiomers; they differ only at the newly formed stereocenter and therefore are diastereomers. Moreover, for enantiomers there is no thermodynamic preference in an achiral medium; but here thermodynamics is not the governing factor for product distribution under $\\text{NaBH}_4$ reduction, which is kinetically controlled.\nB is correct because the chiral substrate leads to diastereomeric transition states of different energies with an achiral reagent, giving diastereomeric products in unequal amounts.\nC is incorrect because kinetic resolution requires a racemic starting material and a chiral reagent or catalyst that reacts at different rates with the two enantiomers; here the starting material is enantiopure and the reagent is achiral.\nD is incorrect because reduction preserves connectivity; the products are stereoisomers (specifically diastereomers), not constitutional isomers.\nE is incorrect because an achiral reagent gives racemic mixtures only when both the substrate and the environment are achiral; the presence of a chiral substrate breaks mirror symmetry and allows unequal formation of stereoisomers via diastereomeric transition states.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is that X and Y are diastereomers formed through diastereomeric transition states of different energies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2166860"}]}
