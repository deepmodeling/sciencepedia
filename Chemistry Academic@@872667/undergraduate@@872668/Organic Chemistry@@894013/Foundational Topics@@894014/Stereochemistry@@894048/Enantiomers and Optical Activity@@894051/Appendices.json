To assign $R/S$ at each stereocenter, we apply the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules. After ranking the four substituents $1$ (highest) to $4$ (lowest), if the lowest priority group (priority $4$) lies on a horizontal bond (toward the viewer), the sense of rotation inferred from the $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ order is inverted.\n\nThe molecule is 2,3-butanediol, $\\mathrm{CH_{3}-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH_{3}}$, with stereocenters at C2 and C3. For both centers, the substituents and their priorities are:\n- At C2: $\\mathrm{OH}$ has priority $1$, the C3 side (carbon attached to $\\mathrm{O}$, $\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{H}$) has priority $2$, the C1 side ($\\mathrm{CH_{3}}$, carbon attached to $\\mathrm{H}$, $\\mathrm{H}$, $\\mathrm{H}$) has priority $3$, and $\\mathrm{H}$ has priority $4$.\n- At C3: $\\mathrm{OH}$ has priority $1$, the C2 side has priority $2$, the C4 side ($\\mathrm{CH_{3}}$) has priority $3$, and $\\mathrm{H}$ has priority $4$.\n\nCompound X: At both C2 and C3, $\\mathrm{OH}$ is on the left and $\\mathrm{H}$ is on the right.\n- C2 in X: positions are left $=1$, bottom $=2$, top $=3$, right $=4$. The path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ is counterclockwise, which would be $S$ if $4$ were away; since $4$ (H) is on a horizontal bond (toward), invert to $R$. Thus C2 is $R$.\n- C3 in X: positions are left $=1$, top $=2$, bottom $=3$, right $=4$. The path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ is clockwise, which would be $R$ if $4$ were away; since $4$ (H) is horizontal (toward), invert to $S$. Thus C3 is $S$.\nTherefore, $X$ is $(2R,3S)$. Because C2 and C3 have opposite configurations and the ends (C1 and C4) are identical methyl groups, $X$ possesses an internal mirror plane and is the meso isomer (achiral).\n\nCompound Y: At C2, $\\mathrm{OH}$ is left and $\\mathrm{H}$ is right; at C3, $\\mathrm{H}$ is left and $\\mathrm{OH}$ is right.\n- C2 in Y: identical to C2 in X, so C2 is $R$.\n- C3 in Y: positions are right $=1$, top $=2$, bottom $=3$, left $=4$. The path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ is counterclockwise, which would be $S$ if $4$ were away; since $4$ (H) is on a horizontal bond (toward), invert to $R$. Thus C3 is $R$.\nTherefore, $Y$ is $(2R,3R)$, which is chiral (its enantiomer would be $(2S,3S)$).\n\nSince $X$ is the meso $(2R,3S)$ isomer (achiral) and $Y$ is the chiral $(2R,3R)$ isomer, they are stereoisomers that are not mirror images.
