The chemist draws a specific stereoisomer of this molecule using a Fischer projection. In this 2D representation, the carbon chain is arranged vertically. The formyl group (–CHO) is placed at the top of the vertical axis (position C1), and the hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH) is at the bottom (position C3). The chiral carbon (C2) is at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axes. For the specific isomer drawn, a hydroxyl group (–OH) is on the right-hand side of the horizontal axis, and a hydrogen atom (–H) is on the left-hand side.\n\nWhat is the absolute configuration of the chiral center in this specific Fischer projection?\n\nA.

By acting as a peer reviewer to find the flaw in the reasoning, you will sharpen your attention to detail and reinforce your understanding of the most frequently misunderstood aspect of assigning configurations from Fischer projections.", "problem": "An organic chemistry student, Alex, is tasked with determining the absolute configuration of the chiral center at carbon-2 (C2) of the amino acid represented by the Fischer projection below. The carbon chain is numbered starting from the carboxylic acid group at the top.\n\n*   **Top group (on C1):** -COOH\n*   **C2 substituents:** -NH2 on the left, -H on the right\n*   **C3 substituents:** -H on the left, -OH on the right\n*   **Bottom group (on C4):** -CH3\n\nAlex performs the following step-by-step analysis to determine the configuration at C2:\n\n**Step A:** The four groups attached to the C2 stereocenter are identified as the amino group (-NH2), the hydrogen atom (-H), the carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and the group attached at C3 (a sec-hydroxypropyl group, hereafter called the C3-substituent).\n\n**Step B:** The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority is assigned based on the atomic number of the atom directly bonded to C2. Nitrogen (in -NH2, atomic number 7) has a higher atomic number than Carbon (in -COOH and the C3-substituent, atomic number 6), which has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen (atomic number 1). Therefore, -NH2 is priority 1 and -H is priority 4.\n\n**Step C:** To differentiate between the two carbon-based groups, -COOH and the C3-substituent, we examine the atoms attached to them. The carbon in -COOH is considered bonded to (O, O, O) due to the C=O double bond. The C3 carbon in the C3-substituent is bonded to an oxygen, another carbon (C4, the methyl group), and a hydrogen, so we list them as (O, C, H). Comparing the two lists atom by atom, the first point of difference is the second atom: O in -COOH versus C in the C3-substituent. Since O has a higher atomic number than C, the -COOH group is assigned a higher priority.\n\n**Step D:** The final priority order for the groups attached to C2 is: -NH2 (1), -COOH (2), C3-substituent (3), and -H (4).\n\n**Step E:** With the priorities established, Alex notes that the lowest-priority group (-H) is on a horizontal line. He then traces the path from the highest priority group (1) to the second (2) to the third (3). This path from -NH2 to -COOH to the C3-substituent traces a clockwise arc.\n\n**Step F:** Based on the clockwise direction of the 1 -> 2 -> 3 path, Alex concludes that the configuration of the stereocenter at C2 is R.\n\nCarefully review Alex's analysis. Identify the specific step that contains the first error in reasoning or procedure. If the entire analysis is correct, select the option indicating no error.\n\nA. Step A contains the first error.\n\nB. Step B contains the first error.\n\nC. Step C contains the first error.\n\nD. Step D contains the first error.\n\nE. Step E contains the first error.\n\nF. Step F contains the first error.\n\nG. There is no error in Alex's analysis.", "solution": "Identify the substituents at C2: $-{\\mathrm{NH}}_{2}$, $-\\mathrm{H}$, $-\\mathrm{COOH}$, and the C3-substituent (the fragment $-\\mathrm{CH}(\\mathrm{OH})\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$). This matches Step A, so Step A is correct.\n\nAssign CIP priorities by the atomic numbers of the atoms directly bonded to C2: $\\mathrm{N}$ ($Z=7$) $>$ $\\mathrm{C}$ ($Z=6$) $>$ $\\mathrm{H}$ ($Z=1$). Thus $-{\\mathrm{NH}}_{2}$ is priority $1$ and $-\\mathrm{H}$ is priority $4$, confirming Step B is correct.\n\nTo distinguish the two carbon-based groups, apply CIP next-layer comparison. For $-\\mathrm{COOH}$, the directly attached carbon is considered bonded to $(\\mathrm{O},\\mathrm{O},\\mathrm{O})$ (double bond counted as two $\\mathrm{O}$). For the C3 carbon, exclude the back bond to C2 and list $(\\mathrm{O},\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{H})$. Comparing $(\\mathrm{O},\\mathrm{O},\\mathrm{O})$ with $(\\mathrm{O},\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{H})$ gives the first difference at the second position: $\\mathrm{O}>\\mathrm{C}$, so $-\\mathrm{COOH}$ outranks the C3-substituent. Step C is correct.\n\nThus the priority order is $1:-{\\mathrm{NH}}_{2}$, $2:-\\mathrm{COOH}$, $3:$ C3-substituent, $4:-\\mathrm{H}$, matching Step D.\n\nIn a Fischer projection, horizontal substituents project toward the viewer and vertical substituents project away. At C2, $-\\mathrm{H}$ (priority $4$) is on a horizontal position (right), so the lowest-priority group is toward the viewer. Tracing $1\\to 2\\to 3$ (left to top to bottom) gives a clockwise path. These observations in Step E are correct.\n\nFor assigning the configuration, when the lowest-priority group is toward the viewer, the sense is inverted: a clockwise $1\\to 2\\to 3$ path corresponds to $S$, and a counterclockwise path corresponds to $R$. Therefore the configuration is $S$, not $R$. The first error occurs in Step F, where the inversion was not applied and the conclusion $R$ is incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{F}$$", "id": "2155579"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the assignment of single stereocenters, we can now analyze the relationships between more complex molecules.

Constitutional isomers", "solution": "We analyze stereochemical relationships using Fischer projections where vertical bonds project away and horizontal bonds project toward the viewer. For molecules that share the same carbon framework and substituent connectivity, two stereoisomers are:\n- Enantiomers if and only if all stereocenters are inverted.\n- Diastereomers if one or more, but not all, stereocenters are inverted.\n- Identical if no stereocenters are inverted.\n\nThe compound 2,3-dichloro-4-methylhexane has three stereocenters at C2, C3, and C4. In the problem, both molecules are drawn with the same Fischer convention: the main chain C1 to C6 is vertical, with the same vertical substituents at each stereocenter. Therefore, comparing horizontal substituents at each center directly reflects the relative configurations.\n\nFrom the descriptions:\n- At C2: Molecule A has left H and right Cl; Molecule B has left H and right Cl. Hence, C2 has the same configuration in A and B.\n- At C3: Molecule A has left Cl and right H; Molecule B has left H and right Cl. Hence, C3 is inverted between A and B.\n- At C4: Molecule A has left Me and right H; Molecule B has left Me and right H. Hence, C4 has the same configuration in A and B.\n\nThus, among the three stereocenters, exactly one (C3) is inverted between the two molecules, while the others (C2 and C4) are unchanged. Since not all stereocenters are inverted, the molecules are not enantiomers. Since at least one stereocenter differs, they are not identical. The connectivity is the same, so they are not constitutional isomers. Therefore, by definition, they are diastereomers.\n\nIn summary, with $n=3$ stereocenters, enantiomers require inversion at all $n$ centers; here only one center is inverted, so the relationship is diastereomeric.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2155533"}]}
