This exercise provides a classic example using tartaric acid, a molecule with two stereocenters. By comparing the (2R, 3R) and (2S, 3S) configurations, you can practice applying the core definition of enantiomers as non-superimposable mirror images where all stereogenic centers are inverted relative to one another [@problem_id:2196730].", "problem": "A food chemist is tasked with characterizing a synthetic compound intended for use as a food acidulant. The compound is identified as 2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid. The synthesis produces a mixture containing various stereoisomers.

The first molecule is identified with the configuration (2R, 3R), and the second molecule is identified with the configuration (2S, 3S).\n\nBased on the principles of stereochemistry, what is the precise relationship between the (2R, 3R) and (2S, 3S) isomers of 2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid?\n\nA.

The two isolated molecules are specified as having configurations (2R, 3R) and (2S, 3S). \n\nBy the definition of enantiomers, a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superposable mirror images have all stereocenters inverted relative to each other. In a molecule with two stereocenters, the configuration pair $(R,R)$ versus $(S,S)$ constitutes such a relationship, as both centers are inverted. Therefore, (2R, 3R) and (2S, 3S) are enantiomers.\n\nThey are not diastereomers, which would require the stereoisomers to differ at some but not all stereocenters (e.g., $(R,R)$ vs $(R,S)$). They are not constitutional isomers because the connectivity is the same. They are not meso compounds; the meso form of tartaric acid corresponds to $(2R,3S)$ or equivalently $(2S,3R)$, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. They are not conformational isomers, which differ by rotation about single bonds without changing stereocenter configurations. Finally, they are not identical compounds because their configurations are opposite at both stereocenters.\n\nHence, the precise relationship is enantiomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2196730"}, {"introduction": "While enantiomers are mirror images, stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other are called diastereomers. This practice explores this crucial relationship by comparing a chiral isomer with an achiral one from the same family. It introduces the special case of a meso compound—a molecule that contains stereocenters but is achiral due to internal symmetry—and asks you to define its relationship to a chiral stereoisomer, reinforcing the distinct properties of diastereomers [@problem_id:2196681].", "problem": "Consider the molecule cyclobutane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, which has stereocenters at carbon-1 and carbon-3.

Stereoisomers have the same atom connectivity but differ in spatial arrangement. Enantiomers are a pair of non-superimposable mirror-image stereoisomers; crucially, both members of an enantiomeric pair must be chiral. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. Constitutional isomers differ in connectivity, and conformational isomers interconvert by rotation without breaking bonds while keeping the same configuration at stereocenters.\n\nIsomer A is specified as the cis-1,3 isomer with an internal plane of symmetry, hence achiral. For identical substituents at C-1 and C-3 on cyclobutane in the cis relationship, the molecule is meso: it contains two stereocenters but is achiral due to the internal mirror plane. In configurational terms, the two configurational assignments 1R,3S and 1S,3R are identical by symmetry for this cis meso form.\n\nIsomer B is specified as the chiral stereoisomer with absolute configuration (1R,3R). Its mirror image is the distinct (1S,3S) enantiomer. Therefore, Isomer B is chiral.\n\nComparing Isomer A and Isomer B: they have the same connectivity, so they are not constitutional isomers. Isomer A is achiral and cannot be the mirror image of the chiral Isomer B, so they are not enantiomers. They differ in configuration at at least one stereocenter (e.g., comparing the meso assignment 1R,3S for A with 1R,3R for B shows one stereocenter matches and the other differs), and they are not related by mere conformational change. Therefore, they are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, which by definition are diastereomers.\n\nHence, the precise stereochemical relationship is diastereomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2196681"}, {"introduction": "The principles of stereochemistry are not just for classifying static molecules; they are essential for predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions. This problem moves from analysis to synthesis, asking you to determine the relationship between products formed from a chiral nucleophile reacting with two different enantiomers of a chiral electrophile.
