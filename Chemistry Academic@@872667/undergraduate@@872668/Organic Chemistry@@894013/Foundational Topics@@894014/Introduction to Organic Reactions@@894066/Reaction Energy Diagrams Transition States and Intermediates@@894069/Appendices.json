This conceptual exercise [@problem_id:2193634] challenges you to work backward from observable properties—a reaction that is fast but unfavorable—to deduce the essential features of its energy profile. Mastering this connection is crucial for predicting how changes in a reaction's structure or conditions will affect its outcome.", "problem": "A hypothetical, elementary, single-step chemical conversion from reactant R to product P can be represented by the reaction R → P. Under a specific set of experimental conditions, this reaction is observed to proceed rapidly, indicating it is kinetically fast. However, at equilibrium, the concentration of the reactant R is significantly greater than that of the product P, which implies the reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable.\n\nGiven this information, which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the energy profile for this reaction? Let $E_R$ be the energy of the reactant, $E_P$ be the energy of the product, and $E_{TS}$ be the energy of the transition state.\n\nA.

The activation energy, $E_{TS} - E_R$, is approximately equal to the overall energy change, $|E_P - E_R|$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to correlate the observed kinetic and thermodynamic properties of a reaction with the features of its energy profile. Let's analyze the two key pieces of information provided.\n\nFirst, the reaction is described as \"kinetically fast.\" The rate of a chemical reaction is governed by its activation energy ($E_a$). The activation energy is the energy barrier that must be overcome for reactants to be converted into products. On an energy profile diagram, this corresponds to the difference in energy between the transition state ($E_{TS}$) and the reactant ($E_R$). A \"kinetically fast\" reaction means that this energy barrier is small, allowing a large fraction of reactant molecules to have sufficient energy to overcome it at a given temperature. Therefore, a small activation energy ($E_a = E_{TS} - E_R$) corresponds to a fast reaction rate.\n\nSecond, the reaction is described as \"thermodynamically unfavorable.\" The thermodynamic favorability of a reaction is determined by the overall change in Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G$), or more simply in this context, the overall change in potential energy ($\\Delta E_{rxn}$). This is the difference in energy between the products ($E_P$) and the reactants ($E_R$). A thermodynamically unfavorable reaction is one where the products are at a higher energy level than the reactants. This means the system must absorb energy from the surroundings to form the products, and at equilibrium, the reactants will be favored. Mathematically, this corresponds to a positive overall energy change: $\\Delta E_{rxn} = E_P - E_R  0$.\n\nNow we can evaluate the given options based on these two conclusions:\n1.  A small activation energy ($E_a = E_{TS} - E_R  0$ is small).\n2.  A positive overall energy change ($\\Delta E_{rxn} = E_P - E_R  0$).\n\nLet's examine each option:\n-   **A. The activation energy, $E_{TS} - E_R$, is large, and the overall energy change, $E_P - E_R$, is negative.** This describes a kinetically slow and thermodynamically favorable reaction. This is incorrect.\n-   **B. The activation energy, $E_{TS} - E_R$, is small, and the overall energy change, $E_P - E_R$, is negative.** This describes a kinetically fast and thermodynamically favorable reaction. This is incorrect because the reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable.\n-   **C. The activation energy, $E_{TS} - E_R$, is large, and the overall energy change, $E_P - E_R$, is positive.** This describes a kinetically slow and thermodynamically unfavorable reaction. This is incorrect because the reaction is kinetically fast.\n-   **D. The activation energy, $E_{TS} - E_R$, is small, and the overall energy change, $E_P - E_R$, is positive.** This describes a kinetically fast and thermodynamically unfavorable reaction. This matches our analysis perfectly.\n-   **E. The reaction must proceed through a stable intermediate whose energy is lower than that of the reactant R.** The problem states the reaction is an \"elementary, single-step\" conversion. A single-step reaction involves only one transition state and no intermediates. The presence of an intermediate would imply a multi-step reaction. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n-   **F. The activation energy, $E_{TS} - E_R$, is approximately equal to the overall energy change, $|E_P - E_R|$.** There is no general principle that states the activation energy must be equal to the magnitude of the overall energy change. For an endergonic reaction ($E_P  E_R$), the Hammond postulate suggests that the transition state resembles the product, but this does not imply equality of the energy differences. $E_a$ and $\\Delta E_{rxn}$ are independent quantities. This statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement D correctly describes a reaction that is both kinetically fast (small activation energy) and thermodynamically unfavorable (positive overall energy change).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2193634"}, {"introduction": "Many chemical transformations proceed through multiple elementary steps, each with its own energy barrier.
