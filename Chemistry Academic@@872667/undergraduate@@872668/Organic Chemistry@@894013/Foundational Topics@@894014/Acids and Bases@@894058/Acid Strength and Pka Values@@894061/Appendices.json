This exercise challenges you to apply $pKa$ values to predict the outcome of a competitive reaction, a key step in planning chemical syntheses [@problem_id:2151569].", "problem": "An undergraduate student is planning a base-mediated reaction and is considering using sodium hydroxide ($\\text{NaOH}$) as the base.

Your task is to analyze the situation and determine which compound is more susceptible to deprotonation by hydroxide.\n\nTo aid your analysis, use the following approximate $pK_a$ values in water:\n- The $pK_a$ of the hydroxyl proton in ethanol is 16.\n- The $pK_a$ of an alpha-proton in acetone (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is 19.\n- The $pK_a$ of water, the conjugate acid of hydroxide, is 15.7.\n\nBased on an analysis of the relevant acid-base equilibria and the structural factors affecting conjugate base stability, select the most accurate statement from the options below.\n\nA. Acetone will be deprotonated to a greater extent because its conjugate base, the enolate, is stabilized by resonance.\nB. Ethanol will be deprotonated to a greater extent because its conjugate base, ethoxide, places the negative charge on a highly electronegative oxygen atom.\nC.

Both equilibria lie to the left (because both $K_\\text{eq}1$), but ethanol is much closer to thermoneutrality than acetone.\n\nStructurally, this is consistent with the given $pK_a$ values: deprotonation of ethanol places negative charge on oxygen in ethoxide, which is strongly stabilized by the high electronegativity of oxygen. Although the acetone enolate is resonance-stabilized, the starting alpha C–H bond is substantially less acidic (higher $pK_a$), so hydroxide deprotonates acetone to a much smaller extent.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that ethanol will be deprotonated to a greater extent because its conjugate base places negative charge on oxygen.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2151569"}, {"introduction": "Many important molecules, from amino acids to pharmaceuticals, possess multiple ionizable groups.
