Neopentane is more symmetrical than n-pentane, which prevents it from being effectively ionized by the electron beam, leading to a weaker molecular ion peak.\n\nB. The molecular ion of neopentane readily undergoes fragmentation to lose a methyl radical, forming a highly stable tertiary carbocation.

The molecular ion of n-pentane is less stable because it can only form primary carbocations upon fragmentation, causing it to fragment so completely that the molecular ion is not observed.\n\nD. N-pentane has a higher boiling point than neopentane, causing it to remain in the mass spectrometer's ionization chamber for a longer time, which increases the probability of detecting its molecular ion.\n\nE. The C-H bonds in neopentane are stronger than the C-H bonds in n-pentane, making it harder for the initial ionization to occur, thereby resulting in a weaker signal overall.", "solution": "In Electron Impact (EI) Mass Spectrometry, ionization proceeds by electron removal from a neutral molecule according to\n$$\\text{M} + e^{-} \\to \\text{M}^{+\\cdot} + 2 e^{-},$$\nproducing a molecular radical cation $\\text{M}^{+\\cdot}$ with excess internal energy.

Consequently, depletion of the molecular ion is less extreme, and a more prominent molecular ion peak at $m/z = 72$ is observed for the n-pentane sample.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is that neopentane’s molecular ion fragments rapidly by loss of a methyl radical to form a highly stabilized tertiary carbocation, depleting the molecular ion population and yielding a strong fragment at $m/z = 57$. This corresponds to option B.\n\nThe other statements are inconsistent with EI-MS principles: symmetry does not prevent ionization (A), n-pentane does not fragment so completely that its molecular ion is absent (C), boiling point differences do not govern molecular ion intensity in EI (D), and EI removes an electron rather than relying on bond strengths for initial ionization (E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2183208"}]}
