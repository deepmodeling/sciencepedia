This initial attack breaks the aromaticity and forms a carbocation intermediate known as a sigma complex or an arenium ion. For comparison, consider the protonation of cyclohexene with a strong acid, $\\text{H}^{+}$, which also forms a secondary carbocation intermediate, the cyclohexyl cation. Although both intermediates are carbocations on a six-membered ring, the sigma complex in EAS is significantly more stable than the cyclohexyl cation.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental reason for the enhanced stability of the sigma complex compared to the cyclohexyl cation?\n\nA. The sigma complex is considered an aromatic species, and this inherent aromaticity is the primary source of its stability.\n\nB. The carbocation in the sigma complex is stabilized by the strong electron-donating inductive effect of the remaining double bonds in the ring, an effect which is absent in the saturated ring structure of the cyclohexyl cation.\n\nC. The positive charge in the sigma complex is delocalized across multiple carbon atoms through resonance, whereas the charge in the cyclohexyl cation is stabilized to a lesser extent, primarily through hyperconjugation.\n\nD. The carbon atom bearing the positive charge in the sigma complex is sp-hybridized, which is inherently more stable than the sp²-hybridized carbocation center in the cyclohexyl cation.\n\nE.

The attack breaks the continuous cyclic conjugation; therefore, the intermediate is not aromatic. Aromaticity is only restored after deprotonation.\n- In protonation of cyclohexene, the resulting cyclohexyl cation has a localized positive charge on an $sp^{2}$-hybridized carbon, without an adjacent $\\pi$ system for conjugative delocalization.\n\nStabilization mechanisms:\n1. Resonance delocalization: In the sigma complex, the positive charge is delocalized over multiple ring carbons via the $\\pi$ system. Canonical structures place the carbocation at the positions ortho and para to the point of electrophile addition, so the resonance hybrid spreads the positive charge over several carbons. This delocalization lowers the energy of the intermediate. Symbolically, if $E_{i}$ are the energies of the individual canonical forms, the resonance hybrid has energy $E_{\\text{hybrid}}$ satisfying\n$$\nE_{\\text{hybrid}}<\\min\\{E_{i}\\},\n$$\nreflecting stabilization from delocalization. The effective resonance stabilization energy, denoted $E_{\\text{res}}(\\text{arenium})$, is substantial due to $\\pi$-conjugation.\n2. Hyperconjugation versus resonance: The cyclohexyl cation lacks adjacent $\\pi$ orbitals, so it cannot delocalize the positive charge by resonance. Its stabilization arises mainly from hyperconjugation with neighboring $\\sigma$ bonds. If there are $n$ effective hyperconjugative interactions of average stabilization energy $\\Delta E_{\\sigma}$ each, the total hyperconjugative stabilization is approximately\n$$\nE_{\\text{HC}} \\approx n\\,\\Delta E_{\\sigma}.\n$$\nEmpirically and conceptually, $\\pi$-resonance delocalization is more stabilizing than a comparable number of $\\sigma$ hyperconjugative interactions, so\n$$\nE_{\\text{res}}(\\text{arenium}) \\gg E_{\\text{HC}}(\\text{cyclohexyl cation}).\n$$\n\nEvaluation of the options using these principles:\n- A is incorrect because the sigma complex is not aromatic; aromaticity is disrupted upon electrophile addition and only restored after deprotonation.\n- B is incorrect because the principal stabilization in the sigma complex is not inductive; it is resonance delocalization through the $\\pi$ system. Inductive effects from double bonds are weak relative to resonance.\n- C is correct: the positive charge in the sigma complex is delocalized over several ring carbons by resonance, whereas the cyclohexyl cation relies mainly on hyperconjugation, which is less stabilizing.\n- D is incorrect because the carbocationic center in both intermediates is effectively $sp^{2}$-hybridized; it is not $sp$-hybridized in the sigma complex.\n- E is incorrect because the relative exothermic or endothermic nature of formation steps does not constitute the fundamental intrinsic stabilization of the intermediate; moreover, formation of the sigma complex is typically endergonic relative to benzene due to loss of aromaticity.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental reason is the resonance delocalization of the positive charge in the sigma complex compared to mainly hyperconjugative stabilization in the cyclohexyl cation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2169342"}, {"introduction": "Now that we understand that the sigma complex is stabilized by resonance, it's crucial to be able to visualize how the positive charge is distributed across the aromatic ring.

This follows from the standard resonance sequence for the arenium ion: initial positive charge adjacent to the attacked carbon, then delocalization through the ring to the para position, and then to the other adjacent carbon.\n\nFor toluene numbered with the methyl-bearing carbon as C1 and proceeding to C6, the electrophile $E^{+}$ attacks at C3 (meta to the methyl group). The carbons adjacent to C3 are C2 and C4, and the carbon para to C3 is C6. Therefore, the positive charge in the sigma complex formed by attack at C3 is delocalized over C2, C4, and C6.\n\nNo resonance contributor for this meta attack places the positive charge on C1 (the benzylic carbon) or on C5; this absence explains why methyl does not stabilize the meta sigma complex via hyperconjugation.\n\nHence the correct set is C2, C4, C6, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2169320"}, {"introduction": "The formation of the sigma complex is only the first half of the EAS story; the reaction must conclude by restoring the ring's stable aromatic character. This final practice focuses on the critical deprotonation step, asking you to reason why the reaction selectively proceeds via one pathway over other plausible alternatives. Solving this puzzle reinforces the concept of aromaticity as a powerful thermodynamic driving force that dictates the outcome of the reaction. [@problem_id:2169296]", "problem": "In the general mechanism for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS), an electrophile ($E^{+}$) attacks an aromatic ring, such as benzene, to form a resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediate known as an arenium ion or Wheland intermediate. In this intermediate, the carbon atom where the electrophile has attached becomes $sp^3$-hybridized, breaking the ring's aromaticity. The final step of the mechanism involves a weak base ($B:$) abstracting a proton to restore the aromatic system and yield the substituted product.\n\nConsider the arenium ion intermediate. Deprotonation must occur to complete the reaction. A proton could, in principle, be removed from the single $sp^3$-hybridized carbon atom (the site of electrophilic attack) or from one of the five $sp^2$-hybridized carbon atoms (the vinylic positions) still in the original plane of the ring. Experimentally, deprotonation occurs exclusively at the $sp^3$ center.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best and most fundamental explanation for this observed regioselectivity?\n\nA. The C-H bond on an $sp^3$-hybridized carbon is inherently more acidic than a C-H bond on an $sp^2$-hybridized carbon because it has a lower bond dissociation energy.\n\nB. The base is sterically hindered from accessing the vinylic protons that are part of the planar carbocation system, favoring attack on the more sterically accessible proton at the tetrahedral $sp^3$ center.\n\nC. The resonance structures of the arenium ion show that the positive charge is delocalized primarily onto the $sp^3$-hybridized carbon, which greatly increases the acidity of its attached proton through an inductive effect.\n\nD. The removal of the proton from the $sp^3$-hybridized carbon is the only deprotonation pathway that re-establishes the exceptionally stable, fully conjugated aromatic pi system.", "solution": "Electrophilic aromatic substitution proceeds through three conceptual stages: (i) attack of $E^{+}$ on the arene to give the arenium (Wheland) ion, (ii) delocalization of the positive charge in the cyclohexadienyl cation, and (iii) deprotonation to regenerate the aromatic ring. In the arenium ion, the ipso carbon (the site of $E^{+}$ addition) is $sp^{3}$-hybridized, which interrupts the cyclic conjugation; the ring is therefore non-aromatic at this stage.\n\nThere are two conceivable deprotonation sites:\n- Pathway P1: deprotonation at the $sp^{3}$-hybridized ipso carbon.\n- Pathway P2: deprotonation at one of the $sp^{2}$-hybridized (vinylic) carbons that still lie in the original plane.\n\nWe analyze each pathway by electron bookkeeping and the requirement for aromaticity.\n\nFor P1, removal of the proton from the $sp^{3}$ carbon returns its hybridization to $sp^{2}$. The electron pair from the C–H bond is used to form a new $\\pi$ bond at that position. This restores a fully conjugated cyclic system of $6$ $\\pi$ electrons, satisfying Hückel’s rule ($4n+2$ with $n=1$), and thus re-establishes the large aromatic stabilization energy. Symbolically, if the arenium ion has $4$ $\\pi$ electrons in two double bonds plus one $sp^{3}$ interruption, then after P1 the ring regains $6$ $\\pi$ electrons in a continuous loop:\n$$\n\\text{arenium} \\xrightarrow[\\text{deprotonation at } sp^{3}]{B:} \\text{aromatic ring with } 6 \\text{ $\\pi$ electrons}.\n$$\nThis rearomatization provides a substantial thermodynamic driving force.\n\nFor P2, removal of a vinylic proton at an $sp^{2}$ carbon directs the C–H bond electron pair into a local bonding change at that site. However, the ipso carbon remains $sp^{3}$-hybridized, so the ring still contains an $sp^{3}$ interruption and cannot form a continuous cyclic $\\pi$ system. Consequently, the product of P2 is non-aromatic (it still lacks a conjugated $6$-$\\pi$-electron loop), and thus it does not gain the large aromatic stabilization energy:\n$$\n\\text{arenium} \\xrightarrow[\\text{deprotonation at } sp^{2}]{B:} \\text{non-aromatic cyclohexadienyl product (no } 6 \\text{ $\\pi$ loop)}.\n$$\nBecause only P1 restores aromaticity, P1 is overwhelmingly favored.\n\nWith this framework, we can evaluate the options:\n- Option A is incorrect. Intrinsic C–H acidity correlates with $s$-character ($sp > sp^{2} > sp^{3}$), so an $sp^{2}$ C–H is generally more acidic than an $sp^{3}$ C–H; moreover, bond dissociation energy is not the fundamental determinant of Brønsted acidity in this context.\n- Option B is not the principal factor; EAS commonly occurs under conditions where steric access to vinylic protons is not the rate- or selectivity-determining element, and steric arguments do not universally predict the observed outcome.\n- Option C misrepresents the charge distribution. In the arenium ion, the positive charge is delocalized over the ring (typically ortho and para to the site of substitution), not localized “primarily” on the $sp^{3}$ carbon. Any local inductive effect at the ipso C–H is not the fundamental driver of the selectivity.\n- Option D correctly and fundamentally states that only deprotonation at the $sp^{3}$ center re-establishes the exceptionally stable, fully conjugated aromatic $\\pi$ system, providing the dominant thermodynamic driving force and thus controlling regioselectivity.\n\nTherefore, the best and most fundamental explanation is that only removal of the $sp^{3}$ proton restores aromaticity (Hückel $4n+2$ stabilization), which dictates the observed selectivity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2169296"}]}
