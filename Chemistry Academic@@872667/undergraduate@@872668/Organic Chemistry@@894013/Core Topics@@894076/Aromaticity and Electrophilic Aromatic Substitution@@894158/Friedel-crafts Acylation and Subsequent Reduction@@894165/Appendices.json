Toluene ($C_6H_5CH_3$):** The methyl group ($-CH_3$) is an activating, ortho, para-director. Friedel-Crafts acylation of toluene would produce a mixture of *o*-methylacetophenone and *p*-methylacetophenone. Subsequent Clemmensen reduction would yield a mixture of *o*-ethyltoluene and *p*-ethyltoluene, not solely ethylbenzene.\n-   **C. Naphthalene ($C_{10}H_8$):** Friedel-Crafts acylation of naphthalene would produce acetylnaphthalene. Reduction of this product would yield ethylnaphthalene, which has a different molecular formula and structure from ethylbenzene.\n-   **D. Phenol ($C_6H_5OH$):** The hydroxyl group ($-OH$) is strongly activating. However, it contains lone pairs of electrons that complex strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst ($AlCl_3$), deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, Friedel-Crafts reactions are generally unsuccessful with phenols.\n-   **E. Nitrobenzene ($C_6H_5NO_2$):** The nitro group ($-NO_2$) is a powerful deactivating group. It makes the aromatic ring so electron-poor that Friedel-Crafts reactions (both acylation and alkylation) do not occur.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only starting material that leads to ethylbenzene as the sole product is benzene.
