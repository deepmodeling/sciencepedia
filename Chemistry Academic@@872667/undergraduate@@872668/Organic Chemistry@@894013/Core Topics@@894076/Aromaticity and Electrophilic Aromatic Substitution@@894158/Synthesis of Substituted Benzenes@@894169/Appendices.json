This exercise challenges you to think like a synthetic chemist by evaluating different routes to p-bromotoluene. By analyzing the directing effects of an activating alkyl group versus a deactivating halogen, you will discover how the sequence of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions dictates the final isomeric product and the overall efficiency of the synthesis [@problem_id:2207583].", "problem": "An organic chemist aims to synthesize 4-bromotoluene (commonly known as p-bromotoluene) starting from benzene. Four different synthetic pathways are proposed for this transformation, each involving a sequence of standard reactions. Your task is to evaluate these proposed routes and identify the one that represents the most efficient and practical method for obtaining p-bromotoluene as the major isomer.\n\nA. Benzene is first treated with methyl chloride (CH₃Cl) in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) as a catalyst.

Benzene is first treated with bromine (Br₂) in the presence of iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃) as a catalyst. The isolated product from this step is then treated with methyl chloride (CH₃Cl) in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃).\n\nC. Benzene is first treated with acetyl chloride (CH₃COCl) in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). The resulting product is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). Finally, the ketone functional group is reduced to a methylene group using a mixture of zinc-mercury amalgam and concentrated hydrochloric acid (Zn(Hg), HCl).\n\nD. Benzene is placed in a reaction vessel with a mixture containing both methyl chloride (CH₃Cl) and bromine (Br₂), with aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) added to catalyze the reactions simultaneously.", "solution": "Goal: Obtain p-bromotoluene from benzene with p as the major isomer. The reactions involved are electrophilic aromatic substitutions (EAS) and, in one proposal, a carbonyl reduction. The key directing and reactivity principles are:\n- Friedel–Crafts alkylation introduces an alkyl group; alkyl substituents are activating and direct further EAS to ortho/para.\n- Halogens are ortho/para directors but are deactivating; deactivated rings react more slowly in Friedel–Crafts alkylation and may even fail under standard conditions.\n- Acyl groups are deactivating and meta-directing; after acylation, subsequent EAS occurs meta to the acyl group.\n- Clemmensen reduction of an aryl ketone reduces the carbonyl to a methylene, converting an acyl substituent $-\\text{COCH}_{3}$ to an ethyl group $-\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{3}$.\n- Simultaneous presence of multiple strong electrophiles and a Lewis acid leads to competing reactions and poor selectivity.\n\nEvaluate each route:\n\nA. First, Friedel–Crafts methylation: benzene + $\\text{CH}_3\\text{Cl}/\\text{AlCl}_3 \\rightarrow$ toluene. Methyl is an activating ortho/para director. Second, bromination: toluene + $\\text{Br}_2/\\text{FeBr}_3 \\rightarrow$ o- and p-bromotoluene as the major products. The para isomer can be favored under controlled conditions (sterics and temperature) and is readily enriched and isolated (the para isomer often crystallizes preferentially), making this route practical for obtaining p-bromotoluene as a major isolable isomer. This sequence employs reliable steps with good rate and selectivity management.\n\nB. First, bromination: benzene + $\\text{Br}_2/\\text{FeBr}_3 \\rightarrow$ bromobenzene. Second, Friedel–Crafts methylation: bromobenzene + $\\text{CH}_3\\text{Cl}/\\text{AlCl}_3$. Because the bromo substituent is deactivating, the ring is less reactive toward Friedel–Crafts alkylation; the reaction is sluggish and may require harsher conditions, leading to low yield and potential side reactions (including rearrangements and polyalkylation). Orientation would still be ortho/para, giving a mixture, not specifically favoring para, and overall practicality is inferior to A.\n\nC. First, Friedel–Crafts acylation: benzene + $\\text{CH}_3\\text{COCl}/\\text{AlCl}_3 \\rightarrow$ acetophenone. The acyl group is meta-directing; bromination next gives meta-bromoacetophenone predominantly. Clemmensen reduction with $\\text{Zn(Hg)}, \\text{HCl}$ converts $-\\text{COCH}_3$ to $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$, yielding meta-bromoethylbenzene, not p-bromotoluene. Thus this route does not produce the target.\n\nD. One-pot mixture of $\\text{CH}_3\\text{Cl}$ and $\\text{Br}_2$ with $\\text{AlCl}_3$ generates multiple electrophiles under strong Lewis acid conditions, leading to competitive, poorly controlled polyalkylation and polyhalogenation with minimal regioselectivity. This is not a practical method to obtain predominantly p-bromotoluene.\n\nConclusion: Route A is the most efficient and practical among the given options for obtaining p-bromotoluene as the major isomer, using an initial activation/directing step (methylation) followed by bromination that yields a high proportion of the para isomer and allows straightforward isolation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2207583"}, {"introduction": "A successful synthesis is not just about choosing the right reactions, but also about avoiding strategic pitfalls. This problem presents a seemingly logical plan to create 3-bromo-5-nitrobenzoic acid that is ultimately inefficient due to a critical flaw. Your task is to diagnose this flaw, which highlights the powerful cumulative effect of multiple deactivating groups on an aromatic ring's reactivity [@problem_id:2207590]. Understanding this principle is key to designing multi-step syntheses that are practical and high-yielding.", "problem": "A student in an organic chemistry lab is tasked with preparing 3-bromo-5-nitrobenzoic acid starting from toluene. They devise the following three-step synthetic plan:\n\n1.  Oxidation of toluene using hot, concentrated potassium permanganate (KMnO4) followed by an acidic workup to produce benzoic acid.\n2.  Nitration of the resulting benzoic acid using a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to form 3-nitrobenzoic acid.\n3.  Bromination of 3-nitrobenzoic acid using bromine (Br2) in the presence of an iron(III) bromide (FeBr3) catalyst to yield the final product, 3-bromo-5-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\nWhile the individual reactions are standard procedures, the overall strategy is considered poor from a synthetic efficiency standpoint. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and significant chemical reason why this synthetic plan is inefficient and likely to give a very poor yield?\n\nA. The methyl group of toluene is an ortho, para-director, and this property should have been utilized to install the substituents before the final oxidation step.\n\nB. The carboxylic acid group is an ortho, para-director, so the nitration in step 2 would incorrectly yield a mixture of 2-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\nC. The final bromination step is performed on an aromatic ring that is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, making the reaction extremely slow and low-yielding.\n\nD. The bromine atom is too large to be installed at the C5 position due to severe steric hindrance from the adjacent carboxylic acid and nitro groups.\n\nE. The nitration and bromination steps should be reversed; brominating benzoic acid first would lead to a much higher yield of the final product.", "solution": "We analyze each step and the directing/activation effects to assess where the inefficiency arises, using standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) principles:\n\n1. Oxidation: Toluene is converted to benzoic acid. This removes the electron-donating methyl group and replaces it with a strongly electron-withdrawing carboxyl group. The carboxyl group deactivates the ring toward EAS and is a meta director. This choice sacrifices the activation and ortho, para-directing power of the methyl group.\n\n2. Nitration of benzoic acid: In EAS, a carboxyl group directs electrophiles meta. Therefore, nitration of benzoic acid gives predominantly 3-nitrobenzoic acid (meta to the carboxyl group). Although the ring is deactivated, a single deactivator still allows nitration under typical mixed-acid conditions. Hence step 2 is feasible and regiochemically correct.\n\n3. Bromination of 3-nitrobenzoic acid: The substrate now bears two strong electron-withdrawing groups (the carboxyl group and the nitro group), both of which are deactivating and meta directing. Although the only available position that is meta to both is C5 (the desired site), the combined deactivation dramatically reduces the rate of EAS. Even with a Lewis acid such as $\\text{FeBr}_3$, electrophilic bromination on a doubly deactivated ring is extremely slow and typically requires forcing conditions, leading to very low yields and possible side reactions. This is the dominant inefficiency and yield problem.\n\nNow we evaluate the statements:\n\n- A: While the methyl group is indeed an ortho, para director, using it to preinstall substituents would not directly provide the 3,5-pattern relative to the eventual carboxyl group, because methyl directs to ortho and para rather than meta positions. Although postponing oxidation can sometimes help, this reasoning does not capture the main cause of poor yield here.\n- B: Incorrect. A carboxylic acid is a meta director, not an ortho, para director; nitration of benzoic acid gives mainly 3-nitrobenzoic acid.\n- C: Correct. The final bromination targets a ring that is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, making EAS bromination extremely slow and low yielding.\n- D: Incorrect. C5 is meta to both substituents, not flanked by immediate ortho steric clashes with both; sterics are not the principal barrier.\n- E: Incorrect. Reversing nitration and bromination still leaves the problem of performing EAS on a strongly deactivated ring; bromination of benzoic acid is also difficult, and nitration after bromination would be even more deactivated.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and significant reason for poor synthetic efficiency is the severe deactivation in the final bromination step.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2207590"}, {"introduction": "Sometimes, the desired substitution pattern on a benzene ring cannot be achieved through direct electrophilic substitution.

The iodine installs exactly where the amino group was, which is meta to the bromine introduced in step 1. This sequence thus delivers the desired 1,3-disubstitution pattern as the major product.\n\nNow exclude the other options:\n- B: Reducing nitrobenzene first gives aniline, which is a strong ortho/para director. Subsequent bromination would occur ortho/para to the amino group, not meta. After diazotization and iodide substitution, the final Br–I relationship would not be meta.\n- C: After bromination of nitrobenzene (valid), attempting diazotization directly on a nitro group is impossible, since diazotization requires an aniline, not a nitro compound. The sequence fails at step 2.\n- D: Reduction to aniline, followed by diazotization and iodide substitution, gives iodobenzene first. Bromination of iodobenzene occurs ortho/para (iodine is an ortho/para director despite being deactivating), not meta. Thus the major product is not the meta isomer.\n- E: Attempting diazotization on nitrobenzene is invalid; the sequence fails at step 1.\n\nTherefore, only sequence A reliably furnishes m-bromoiodobenzene as the major product by first leveraging the meta-directing nitro group to place bromine, then converting the ring position originally bearing nitro into iodine via reduction, diazotization, and substitution with iodide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2207570"}]}
