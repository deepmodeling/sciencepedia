No reaction occurs under these conditions.", "solution": "The described conditions (sodium metal in liquid ammonia with an alcohol as proton source) are those of the Birch reduction. The Birch reduction converts an aromatic ring to a nonconjugated 1,4-cyclohexadiene by the sequence of steps: \n(1) single-electron transfer to form a radical anion, \n(2) protonation at a position of highest anionic character, \n(3) a second single-electron transfer, and \n(4) a second protonation, furnishing a 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\nRegiochemistry is governed by the substituent’s electronic effect on the radical anion. For electron-donating groups such as alkyl groups, the negative charge in the radical anion is disfavored at the ipso and para positions. Consequently, protonation occurs at other positions, and the carbons bearing electron-donating substituents remain $sp^2$-hybridized (that is, they end up as part of the double bonds in the 1,4-cyclohexadiene product). \n\nApplying this to 1,4-dimethylbenzene (p-xylene), both methyl groups are electron-donating, and the para-disubstituted symmetry implies that both methyl-bearing carbons remain $sp^2$ in the product. Therefore, the resulting 1,4-cyclohexadiene has double bonds at the carbons bearing the methyl substituents, corresponding to 1,4-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\nChecking the options:\n- A places both methyl groups on $sp^2$ carbons in a 1,4-cyclohexadiene, matching the Birch outcome for para dialkylbenzene.\n- B would place one methyl on $sp^2$ and the other on $sp^3$, which is inconsistent with the symmetry and directing effects.\n- C changes the substitution pattern (implying rearrangement), which does not occur in a Birch reduction.\n- D is complete hydrogenation, which is not achieved under Birch conditions.\n- E is incorrect because Birch reduction does proceed under the given conditions.\n\nThus, the single major product is 1,4-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2195344"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond basic principles, a crucial skill in organic synthesis is choosing the right reaction for a specific task, a concept known as chemoselectivity. Molecules often contain multiple functional groups, and a successful transformation requires a reagent that acts on one group while leaving others untouched.

The target transformation is selective dearomatization of the benzene ring to a non-aromatic 1,4-cyclohexadiene while leaving the terminal alkene unchanged.\n\nWe assess each reagent set based on known chemoselectivities:\n\n- Option A employs catalytic hydrogenation with excess $\\mathrm{H}_2$ and Pd/C under high pressure. Catalytic hydrogenation readily reduces isolated alkenes, and under high pressure it can eventually hydrogenate aromatic rings to cyclohexanes. This would hydrogenate both the aromatic ring and the terminal alkene, thus failing the selectivity requirement.\n\n- Option B uses $\\mathrm{NaBH}_4$ in methanol. $\\mathrm{NaBH}_4$ is a hydride donor that reduces polar $\\pi$-bonds such as aldehydes and ketones.

The Birch reduction involves sequential electron transfer from the alkali metal to the arene to form a radical anion, protonation by the alcohol, a second electron transfer, and a second protonation, yielding a 1,4-cyclohexadiene. For anisole (an electron-donating substituent), the ring is reduced to a non-aromatic diene in a predictable pattern, and crucially, isolated nonconjugated alkenes are typically unreactive under these dissolving metal conditions. Therefore, the aromatic ring is selectively reduced while the terminal alkene remains intact.\n\n- Option E employs ozonolysis followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This would cleave the terminal alkene and leave the aromatic ring unaffected, contrary to the goal.\n\nTherefore, the only reagent set that selectively reduces the aromatic ring to a non-aromatic diene while preserving the isolated terminal alkene is the Birch reduction: $\\mathrm{Na}$, $\\mathrm{NH}_3(l)$, EtOH.\n\nHence, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2195374"}, {"introduction": "The products of chemical reactions are not always the final destination; often, they are merely intermediates on a longer synthetic path.

For rings bearing an electron-donating substituent such as a methoxy group, the reduction is regioselective and yields a product where the substituent remains on a double bond. Thus, the Birch reduction of anisole produces 1-methoxy-1,4-cyclohexadiene. The conditions described in Step 1 of option C (lithium metal in liquid ammonia with tert-butanol) are appropriate for this transformation.\n\n**Step 2 (Isomerization):** To obtain 1-methoxycyclohexa-1,3-diene, the double bonds of the initial non-conjugated diene product must migrate to form a thermodynamically more stable conjugated system. This rearrangement is achieved under basic conditions via allylic deprotonation and double-bond migration. A strong, non-nucleophilic base such as potassium tert-butoxide in a polar aprotic solvent like dimethyl sulfoxide promotes this favorable isomerization to the conjugated diene.\n\n**Evaluation of options:**\n- A: The Birch reduction in Step 1 is correct, but the mild aqueous acid workup in Step 2 will not cause the necessary isomerization.\n- B: Catalytic hydrogenation under these conditions is generally not effective for reducing the aromatic ring and is not selective for partial reduction.\n- C: Step 1 is a Birch reduction, correctly forming 1-methoxy-1,4-cyclohexadiene. Step 2 uses potassium tert-butoxide in DMSO, a strong base system that will effectively isomerize the 1,4-diene to the desired conjugated 1-methoxycyclohexa-1,3-diene. This matches the required two-step sequence.\n- D: Cold, dilute $\\mathrm{KMnO}_4$ is an oxidizing agent and does not reduce aromatic rings.\n- E: Birch reduction followed by ozonolysis would cleave the double bonds, not isomerize them.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is a Birch reduction followed by base-catalyzed isomerization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2195348"}]}
