In a cycloalkene, this opens the ring to give a single acyclic product.\n\n2) Define the substrate’s structure and numbering: In 3-methylcyclopentene, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the methyl group is on C3. The stereocenter is at C3.\n\n3) Apply ozonolysis mapping: The cleavage of the C1=C2 double bond opens the ring. Carbons C1 and C2 are converted to aldehyde groups, becoming the termini of a new linear chain. The backbone of this chain consists of the remaining ring atoms: C3, C4, and C5. The connectivity is:\n`CHO (from C2) — C3(with -CH3) — C4 — C5 — CHO (from C1)`\nThis results in a five-carbon dialdehyde.\n\n4) Assign the IUPAC name: For a dialdehyde, numbering starts from one end to give the substituent the lowest possible locant. Numbering from the end derived from C2 places the methyl group on the second carbon:\n`CHO (at C1) — CH(CH3) (at C2) — CH2 (at C3) — CH2 (at C4) — CHO (at C5)`\nThe base name is therefore 2-methylpentanedial.\n\n5) Analyze stereochemistry: The reaction does not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3 in the reactant, which becomes C2 in the product). We must determine if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority order of the substituents changes, which would invert the R/S designation.\n  - **Reactant ((R)-3-methylcyclopentene):** The substituents at the chiral C3 are -H, -CH3, the path toward the double bond (-C2=C1-), and the path away from it (-C4-C5-). The C2-path has higher priority than the C4-path. The priority order is: `(-C2=C1-) > (-C4-C5-) > -CH3 > -H`.\n  - **Product (2-methylpentanedial):** The substituents at the chiral C2 are -H, -CH3, a formyl group (-CHO), and an alkyl-aldehyde chain (-CH2-CH2-CHO). The -CHO group originated from the C2-path of the reactant, and the -CH2-CH2-CHO chain from the C4-C5-C1 part.\n  - **Priority Comparison:** The -CHO group (C attached to {O, O, H}) has higher priority than the -CH2-CH2-CHO chain (C attached to {C, H, H}). The methyl group has the third-highest priority. The priority order in the product is: `(-CHO) > (-CH2-CH2-CHO) > -CH3 > -H`.\n  - Since the group that was priority #1 in the reactant becomes priority #1 in the product, and likewise for priorities #2 and #3, the overall CIP ranking of the substituents is unchanged.
