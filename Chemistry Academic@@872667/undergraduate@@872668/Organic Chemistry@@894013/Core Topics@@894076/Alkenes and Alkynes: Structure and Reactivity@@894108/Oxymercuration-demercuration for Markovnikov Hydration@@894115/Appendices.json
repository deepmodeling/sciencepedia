Water, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the more substituted carbon of the mercurinium ion, opening the ring and placing $\\mathrm{OH}$ at the more substituted position in a Markovnikov sense. For 2-butene, the two alkene carbons are equivalent by symmetry, so regiochemical preference places $\\mathrm{OH}$ at either alkene carbon to give the same constitutional product, namely a secondary alcohol at carbon 2.\n\nStep 2 (demercuration): Treatment with aqueous basic $\\text{NaBH}_{4}$ replaces the $\\text{HgOAc}$ group with hydrogen, yielding the alcohol derived from net addition of $\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{OH}$ across the original double bond. No carbocation rearrangements occur in this sequence.\n\nTherefore, hydration of 2-butene under these conditions produces 2-butanol as the single constitutional product (obtained as a racemic mixture if chiral centers are formed), matching option B. Other options are inconsistent: 1-butanol would require anti-Markovnikov hydration (e.g., hydroboration-oxidation), butanal is not formed in hydration, 2-methyl-2-propanol cannot arise from 2-butene under these conditions, and diethyl ether would require an ether synthesis pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2187894"}, {"introduction": "A key advantage of oxymercuration-demercuration is its ability to suppress the carbocation rearrangements that often complicate standard acid-catalyzed hydrations.

In oxymercuration with mercury(II) acetate in water, the alkene reacts to form a bridged mercurinium ion. Nucleophilic attack by water occurs at the more substituted carbon due to better stabilization of positive charge in the transition state, giving Markovnikov regiochemistry. Therefore, after nucleophilic opening and deprotonation, the intermediate has an alcohol function at C1 (the more substituted carbon bearing the methyl group) and a C–Hg(OAc) group at C2 (the less substituted carbon). Oxymercuration proceeds without carbocation rearrangement.\n\nIn the subsequent demercuration step using sodium borodeuteride, the borodeuteride reagent reduces the carbon–mercury bond by delivering deuteride to the carbon bearing mercury, replacing Hg(OAc) with deuterium while leaving the hydroxyl group in place. Thus deuterium is installed at C2, and the hydroxyl remains at C1. The methyl substituent remains at C1 throughout.\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature for cyclohexanols, the ring is numbered so that the carbon bearing the hydroxyl is C1.
