Propene and Hydrogen Chloride\n\nD. 2-Methylpropene and Hydrogen Iodide\n\nE. Cyclopropane and Hydrogen Iodide", "solution": "The reaction class is electrophilic addition of a hydrogen halide HX to an alkene under polar (ionic) conditions. The regiochemical outcome follows Markovnikov’s rule: protonation occurs to form the more stable carbocation intermediate, and the halide anion then attacks that carbocation. For hydrogen iodide specifically, in the absence of radical initiators, the ionic Markovnikov pathway dominates. Therefore, to obtain 2-iodopropane (isopropyl iodide) as the major constitutional isomer, the starting alkene must be such that Markovnikov protonation produces a secondary carbocation at the middle carbon of a three-carbon chain, which is then trapped by iodide.\n\nPropene ($CH_3–CH=CH_2$) satisfies this requirement. Protonation at the terminal carbon yields a secondary carbocation at the central carbon, and subsequent capture by iodide affords 2-iodopropane as the major product. In contrast:\n- 1-Butene with HI gives 2-iodobutane as the Markovnikov product, not 2-iodopropane.\n- Propene with HCl gives 2-chloropropane, not the iodide.\n- 2-Methylpropene with HI gives tert-butyl iodide (2-iodo-2-methylpropane), not 2-iodopropane.\n- Cyclopropane with HI undergoes ring opening to give a linear iodide (predominantly 1-iodopropane), not 2-iodopropane.\n\nThus, the only pair that yields 2-iodopropane as the major product in one step via electrophilic addition is propene and hydrogen iodide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2168821"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basics, we now explore how reaction conditions can influence the outcome. This problem [@problem_id:2168759] introduces a scenario with a nucleophilic solvent, creating a competition for the carbocation intermediate.

Protonation at C2 generates a tertiary carbocation at C1 (bearing the methyl substituent), which is favored over the secondary carbocation at C2. No rearrangement is necessary because the tertiary carbocation forms directly and is already the most stable.\n\nStep 2 (Competing nucleophile capture): The tertiary carbocation can be trapped by either bromide or methanol. The rates of these capture steps can be represented as\n$$v_{\\text{Br}}=k_{\\text{Br}}[\\text{Br}^{-}][\\text{carbocation}],\\quad v_{\\text{MeOH}}=k_{\\text{MeOH}}[\\text{MeOH}][\\text{carbocation}].$$\nBecause methanol is the solvent, $[\\text{MeOH}]$ is very large compared to $[\\text{Br}^{-}]$. Even if $k_{\\text{Br}}>k_{\\text{MeOH}}$, the overall rate of capture is dominated by the solvent due to its high concentration: $v_{\\text{MeOH}}\\gg v_{\\text{Br}}$. Thus, the carbocation is captured predominantly by methanol to give a methoxonium intermediate at C1.\n\nStep 3 (Deprotonation): The resulting methoxonium ion is deprotonated by a base present in the medium (methanol or bromide), yielding the neutral ether. This corresponds to Markovnikov addition of methanol across the double bond, placing the methoxy group at C1.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 1-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexane, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2168759"}, {"introduction": "The reactivity of carbocations holds one more surprise: their ability to rearrange into more stable structures.
