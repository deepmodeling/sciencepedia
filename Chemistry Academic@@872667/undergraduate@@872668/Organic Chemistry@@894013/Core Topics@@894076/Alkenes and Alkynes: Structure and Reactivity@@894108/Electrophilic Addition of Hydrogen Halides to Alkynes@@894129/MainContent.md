## Introduction
The [electrophilic addition](@entry_id:191707) of [hydrogen halides](@entry_id:193573) (HX) to [alkynes](@entry_id:746370) is a cornerstone reaction in [organic chemistry](@entry_id:137733), serving as a fundamental method for transforming the [carbon-carbon triple bond](@entry_id:188700) into more functionalized structures. This reaction is pivotal because it converts relatively simple starting materials into valuable vinyl halides and geminal dihalides, which are versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. While the process shares similarities with the well-known addition to alkenes, the unique electronic properties and linear geometry of [alkynes](@entry_id:746370) introduce critical differences in mechanism, reactivity, and selectivity. Understanding these nuances is essential for predicting reaction outcomes and designing effective synthetic strategies.

This article provides a comprehensive examination of this transformation. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, will dissect the core aspects of the reaction, from the stepwise mechanism involving the vinylic [carbocation intermediate](@entry_id:204002) to the governing principles of regioselectivity (Markovnikov's rule), kinetics, and stereochemistry. Building on this foundation, the second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will explore the practical utility of the reaction in synthesis, investigating complex scenarios such as intramolecular cyclizations, [substituent effects](@entry_id:187387), [carbocation rearrangements](@entry_id:203552), and competitive reactivity. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will allow you to apply these concepts to solve targeted problems, reinforcing your understanding of how to predict products and propose synthetic pathways.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The reaction of [hydrogen halides](@entry_id:193573) with [alkynes](@entry_id:746370) is a canonical example of [electrophilic addition](@entry_id:191707), a fundamental process in organic chemistry. While it shares conceptual similarities with the analogous reaction of [alkenes](@entry_id:183502), the unique electronic and structural properties of the [carbon-carbon triple bond](@entry_id:188700) introduce important distinctions in reactivity, mechanism, and [product distribution](@entry_id:269160). This chapter will systematically dissect the principles governing these reactions, from the initial [electrophilic attack](@entry_id:153502) to the formation of vinyl halides and geminal dihalides.

### The Fundamental Transformation: An Addition Reaction

At its core, the reaction of an alkyne with a hydrogen halide ($HX$) is an **addition reaction**. This classification arises from the net change in bonding: one of the two $\pi$ bonds of the alkyne is broken, and in its place, two new $\sigma$ bonds are formed—one to the hydrogen and one to the halogen from the $HX$ molecule [@problem_id:2168500]. The carbon skeleton remains intact, but the [degree of unsaturation](@entry_id:182199) is reduced.

This transformation is accompanied by a predictable change in the hybridization of the participating carbon atoms. In the starting alkyne, the two carbons of the [triple bond](@entry_id:202498) are **$sp$-hybridized**, exhibiting a linear geometry. Upon the addition of one equivalent of $HX$ to form a haloalkene (also known as a [vinyl halide](@entry_id:187999)), these two carbons become **$sp^2$-hybridized**, adopting a trigonal planar geometry around the newly formed double bond. If the reaction is allowed to proceed with a second equivalent of $HX$, these same carbons ultimately become **$sp^3$-hybridized** in the final saturated [dihaloalkane](@entry_id:204757) product [@problem_id:2168469]. Understanding this progression from $sp$ to $sp^2$ to $sp^3$ [hybridization](@entry_id:145080) is crucial for visualizing the structural evolution of the molecule throughout the reaction sequence.

### The Reaction Mechanism and Regioselectivity: Markovnikov's Rule

The [electrophilic addition](@entry_id:191707) of $HX$ to an alkyne is a stepwise process. The mechanism begins with the electron-rich $\pi$ system of the alkyne acting as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic proton of the hydrogen halide. This protonation of the triple bond is the [rate-determining step](@entry_id:137729) and results in the formation of a highly reactive intermediate known as a **[vinylic carbocation](@entry_id:195402)**—a species in which the positive charge resides on a doubly bonded carbon atom. In the second, rapid step, the halide anion ($X^−$), acting as a nucleophile, attacks the positively charged carbon to form the final [vinyl halide](@entry_id:187999) product.

For unsymmetrical [alkynes](@entry_id:746370), such as terminal [alkynes](@entry_id:746370) ($R-C\equiv CH$), the initial protonation can, in principle, occur at either of the two $sp$-hybridized carbons, leading to two different [vinylic carbocation](@entry_id:195402) intermediates. However, the reaction is highly **regioselective**, meaning one constitutional isomer is formed almost exclusively. This selectivity is governed by the [relative stability](@entry_id:262615) of the possible [carbocation](@entry_id:199575) intermediates, a principle encapsulated by **Markovnikov's rule**. The rule states that in the addition of a protic acid to an unsymmetrical alkyne, the proton adds to the carbon atom that already bears the greater number of hydrogen atoms.

Consider the addition of hydrogen bromide to propyne ($CH_3C{\equiv}CH$). Protonation of the terminal carbon (C1) yields a secondary [vinylic carbocation](@entry_id:195402) ($CH_3\overset{+}{C}=CH_2$), where the positive charge is on the internal carbon (C2). Conversely, protonation of the internal carbon (C2) would yield a primary [vinylic carbocation](@entry_id:195402) ($CH_3CH=\overset{+}{C}H$). Vinylic [carbocation stability](@entry_id:149581) increases with the degree of substitution at the charged carbon, analogous to the stability trend of alkyl [carbocations](@entry_id:185610). Therefore, the secondary [vinylic carbocation](@entry_id:195402) is significantly more stable than the primary one. The reaction proceeds through the lower-energy pathway involving the more stable secondary [carbocation](@entry_id:199575). Consequently, the proton adds to C1 [@problem_id:2168492]. The subsequent attack of the bromide ion at C2 yields **2-bromopropene** ($CH_3C(Br)=CH_2$) as the major product [@problem_id:2168468]. This principle holds true for other terminal [alkynes](@entry_id:746370), such as 1-butyne, which reacts with $HBr$ to form 2-bromo-1-butene via the more stable secondary vinylic [carbocation intermediate](@entry_id:204002) [@problem_id:2168457].

### Kinetics: Alkyne versus Alkene Reactivity

An intuitive but incorrect assumption is that [alkynes](@entry_id:746370), with two $\pi$ bonds and higher electron density, should be more nucleophilic and thus react faster than [alkenes](@entry_id:183502) in electrophilic additions. Experimental evidence, however, demonstrates the opposite: [electrophilic addition](@entry_id:191707) to an alkyne is generally slower than to a comparable alkene. For instance, 2-butene reacts with $HBr$ much more rapidly than 2-butyne does [@problem_id:2168791].

The explanation for this attenuated reactivity lies in the stability of the [carbocation intermediate](@entry_id:204002) formed in the rate-determining step. The protonation of an alkene yields an **alkyl carbocation**, where the positive charge resides on an $sp^2$-hybridized carbon. In contrast, the protonation of an alkyne yields a **[vinylic carbocation](@entry_id:195402)**, with the positive charge on an $sp$-hybridized carbon.

An $sp$-hybridized orbital has 50% $s$-character, compared to 33% for an $sp^2$ orbital. The greater $s$-character means the electrons in an $sp$ orbital are held more tightly to the nucleus, making an $sp$-hybridized carbon more electronegative than an $sp^2$-hybridized carbon. Placing a positive charge on a more electronegative atom is energetically unfavorable. Therefore, a [vinylic carbocation](@entry_id:195402) is significantly less stable and higher in energy than an alkyl [carbocation](@entry_id:199575). According to the Hammond postulate, the high energy of the vinylic [carbocation intermediate](@entry_id:204002) implies a high-energy transition state leading to its formation. This higher activation energy results in a slower reaction rate for [alkynes](@entry_id:746370) compared to [alkenes](@entry_id:183502) [@problem_id:2168450, 2168791].

### The Influence of the Halide: Reactivity Trend of HX

The nature of the hydrogen halide also plays a critical role in the reaction kinetics. The rate of [electrophilic addition](@entry_id:191707) to a given alkyne follows the order: $HI > HBr > HCl \gg HF$. This trend is a direct consequence of the factors that influence the activation energy of the rate-determining protonation step [@problem_id:2168505].

Two key properties of the [hydrogen halides](@entry_id:193573) are responsible for this trend. First is the **[bond dissociation energy](@entry_id:136571)** of the $H-X$ bond, which decreases down the group from fluorine to [iodine](@entry_id:148908) ($H-F > H-Cl > H-Br > H-I$). A weaker bond, such as the $H-I$ bond, requires less energy to break during the proton transfer to the alkyne, thus lowering the [activation barrier](@entry_id:746233). Second is the **[acidity](@entry_id:137608)** of the hydrogen halide, which increases down the group ($HI > HBr > HCl > HF$). A stronger acid is a more effective [proton donor](@entry_id:149359), which also facilitates the protonation of the alkyne and lowers the energy of the transition state. Both of these effects work in concert, making $HI$ the most reactive and $HCl$ significantly less so in these additions.

### Addition of Excess Reagent: The Path to Geminal Dihalides

When an alkyne is treated with one equivalent of $HX$, the reaction stops at the [vinyl halide](@entry_id:187999) stage. However, if an excess of the hydrogen halide is used, a second addition reaction can occur across the double bond of the newly formed [vinyl halide](@entry_id:187999). This second addition also adheres strictly to Markovnikov's rule.

Let's revisit the reaction of propyne, this time with excess $HCl$. The first addition yields 2-chloropropene, $CH_3C(Cl)=CH_2$. In the second addition, the proton from $HCl$ adds to the carbon atom that already has more hydrogens—in this case, the terminal $CH_2$ group. This generates a carbocation at the internal carbon (C2). This [carbocation](@entry_id:199575), $CH_3\overset{+}{C}(Cl)-CH_3$, is not only secondary but is also significantly stabilized by resonance involving the lone pair electrons on the adjacent chlorine atom. The subsequent attack by a chloride ion at this position yields **2,2-dichloropropane**, $CH_3CCl_2CH_3$ [@problem_id:2168491].

This outcome is general for terminal [alkynes](@entry_id:746370). The reaction with two or more equivalents of $HX$ consistently produces a **[geminal dihalide](@entry_id:184464)**, a compound with two halogen atoms attached to the same carbon atom. For example, 1-pentyne reacts with excess $HI$ to produce 2,2-diiodopentane [@problem_id:2168444], and 4,4-dimethylpent-1-yne with excess $HBr$ yields 2,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylpentane [@problem_id:2168499]. The regioselectivity of both the first and second additions ensures the geminal substitution pattern.

### Stereochemistry of Addition to Internal Alkynes

While terminal [alkynes](@entry_id:746370) present questions of regioselectivity, symmetrical internal [alkynes](@entry_id:746370), such as 3-hexyne, provide a platform to study the [stereochemistry](@entry_id:166094) of the addition. Since both alkyne carbons are electronically equivalent, regioselectivity is not a factor. However, the addition of one equivalent of $HBr$ to 3-hexyne yields a mixture of (E)- and (Z)-3-bromohex-3-ene.

The formation of [stereoisomers](@entry_id:139490) arises from the geometry of the [nucleophilic attack](@entry_id:151896) on the vinylic [carbocation intermediate](@entry_id:204002). Following protonation, the bromide ion can attack the planar, $sp$-hybridized carbocation center from two faces. Attack from the side opposite to the newly added hydrogen results in **[anti-addition](@entry_id:196470)**. Attack from the same side results in **[syn-addition](@entry_id:192094)**. For steric reasons, the [anti-addition](@entry_id:196470) pathway is generally favored, as it minimizes interaction between the incoming nucleophile and the groups on the other side of the nascent double bond. Consequently, the **(E)-isomer** (trans product) is typically the major product, while the (Z)-isomer (cis product) is formed as the minor product. The reaction is thus described as being **stereoselective** for the (E)-isomer, but it is not stereospecific, as both isomers are formed [@problem_id:2168480].
