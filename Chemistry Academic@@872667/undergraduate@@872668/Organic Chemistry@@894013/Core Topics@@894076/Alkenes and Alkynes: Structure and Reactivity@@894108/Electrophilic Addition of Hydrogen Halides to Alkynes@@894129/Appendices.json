{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our hands-on exploration, we'll tackle a fundamental problem in alkyne chemistry: predicting the outcome of an electrophilic addition. This exercise focuses on the reaction of a terminal alkyne with one equivalent of a hydrogen halide, a classic scenario governed by Markovnikov's rule. By working through this problem, you will practice identifying the more substituted carbon of the alkyne, predicting the formation of the more stable vinyl cation intermediate, and ultimately determining the major product [@problem_id:2168463].", "problem": "Consider the reaction of 4-methyl-1-pentyne with one equivalent of hydrogen chloride (HCl) at a low temperature.

In the absence of peroxides, HCl adds in a Markovnikov fashion. With one equivalent of HX, the reaction stops at the vinyl halide stage rather than proceeding to the geminal dihalide (which would require excess HX and/or more forcing conditions).\n\nDetail the stepwise mechanism and regiochemistry:\n- Protonation of the alkyne forms a vinyl cation. The regioselective step follows Markovnikov’s rule: the proton adds to the terminal carbon (C1), generating the more substituted vinyl cation at C2. This places the positive charge on the internal carbon, which is more stabilized than on the terminal carbon.\n- Chloride anion then attacks the cationic carbon (C2), giving the vinyl chloride. The resulting double bond remains between C1 and C2.\n\nRelate to the product structure and naming: The product is the corresponding vinyl chloride with the double bond at C1–C2 and chlorine at C2, i.e., 2-chloro-4-methyl-1-pentene. Stereochemistry at the alkene (E/Z) is not controlled in this ionic addition and a mixture is typically formed; therefore, the option that does not specify stereochemistry is appropriate.\n\nExclude other options:\n- (E)-1-chloro-4-methyl-1-pentene places Cl at C1 (anti-Markovnikov) and specifies a single stereoisomer; both are inconsistent.\n- 2,2-dichloro-4-methylpentane requires addition of two equivalents (geminal dihalide), not observed with one equivalent at low temperature.\n- 4-chloro-4-methyl-1-pentene and 3-chloro-4-methyl-1-pentene do not arise from direct Markovnikov addition to the alkyne.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 2-chloro-4-methyl-1-pentene.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2168463"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's switch roles from predicting a reaction's future to uncovering its past. This problem presents you with the final product of an addition reaction and asks you to deduce the identity of the starting alkyne. This type of reverse-thinking, or retrosynthesis, is a crucial skill for any organic chemist, as it forms the basis of planning how to create complex molecules.

In the absence of peroxides, addition of HBr to an alkyne proceeds with Markovnikov regiochemistry. For a terminal alkyne of the form RC≡CH, the first equivalent of HBr adds such that H attaches to the terminal carbon and Br attaches to the internal carbon, giving a vinyl bromide with Br on the more substituted (internal) carbon. A second equivalent of HBr then adds across the double bond in a Markovnikov fashion to give a geminal dibromide, with both bromines on the same internal carbon adjacent to the methyl group.

Comparing with the general product $R-CBr_2-CH_3$, we identify R as a propyl group, $R = CH_3-CH_2-CH_2-$. Therefore, the original alkyne must be $RC≡CH = CH_3-CH_2-CH_2-C≡CH$, whose IUPAC name is pent-1-yne.\n\nTo exclude the other options:\n- Pent-2-yne would place both bromines on the central carbon of the five-carbon chain, giving 3,3-dibromopentane, not 2,2-dibromopentane.\n- 3-Methylbut-1-yne is a terminal alkyne but would yield a branched geminal dibromide (2,2-dibromo-3-methylbutane), not a straight-chain pentane derivative.\n- But-1-yne would give 2,2-dibromobutane (four carbons), not a pentane.\n- Hex-1-yne would give 2,2-dibromohexane (six carbons), not a pentane.\n\nHence, only pent-1-yne fits the observed product 2,2-dibromopentane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2168498"}, {"introduction": "This final practice problem challenges you to compare and contrast the reactivity of two different isomers, 1-butyne and 2-butyne.

Reaction of 1-butyne ($HC\\equiv C-CH_2-CH_3$):\n- Regioselectivity: Markovnikov addition places $H$ on the terminal carbon (the less substituted alkyne carbon) and $Cl$ on the internal alkyne carbon (the more substituted position).

Reaction of 2-butyne ($CH_3-C\\equiv C-CH_3$):\n- Regioselectivity: The alkyne is symmetric, so only a single constitutional product results upon adding one equivalent of $HCl$, namely 2-chloro-2-butene, $CH_3-C(Cl)=CH-CH_3$.\n- Stereochemistry: Ionic addition to alkynes is not stereospecific; both syn and anti additions occur, leading to both $E$ and $Z$ 2-chloro-2-butene.
