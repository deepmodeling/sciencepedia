This is typically accomplished through a two-step sequence involving the formation of an epoxide intermediate, which is then opened via nucleophilic attack.\n\nConsider the synthesis of pentane-1,2-diol starting from 1-pentene.

This is not the epoxide pathway and not anti, so it is incorrect.\n\nB. $O_3$ followed by Zn, $H_2O$ is reductive ozonolysis that cleaves the double bond to carbonyl compounds; it does not yield a diol. Incorrect.\n\nC. $BH_3 \\cdot THF$ followed by $H_2O_2$, NaOH is hydroboration–oxidation, giving a single alcohol (anti-Markovnikov hydration), not a vicinal diol. Incorrect.\n\nD. m-CPBA epoxidizes the alkene to the corresponding epoxide. Subsequent treatment with $H_3O^+$ protonates the epoxide and water attacks in an anti fashion (backside attack on the protonated epoxide), yielding the trans (anti) 1,2-diol. This exactly follows the described two-step epoxide formation then nucleophilic opening and gives pentane-1,2-diol. Correct.\n\nE. $Br_2, H_2O$ forms a halohydrin (anti addition of Br and OH). NaOH (aq) then deprotonates the alcohol to form the epoxide via intramolecular displacement. Although hydroxide in water can, in principle, open epoxides to give trans diols, the sequence as written specifies epoxide formation in step 2, not a distinct subsequent opening step; it therefore does not match the described two-step “epoxide then opening” sequence as given. The canonical outcome emphasized for this two-step set is epoxide formation rather than the diol under the listed conditions. Not the intended match.\n\nTherefore, only D implements the specified two-step epoxide-then-opening pathway to give the anti vicinal diol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2155045"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying reagents, understanding the three-dimensional outcome of a reaction is crucial. This exercise delves into the stereochemistry of anti-dihydroxylation, starting with a geometrically defined alkene. By tracing the stereochemical path from a *cis*-alkene to its diol product, you will see how the concerted *syn*-epoxidation followed by nucleophilic *anti*-attack dictates the final stereochemical relationship in the product [@problem_id:2155051].", "problem": "A two-step synthesis is performed starting from cis-3-hexene. In the first step, cis-3-hexene is reacted with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to form an intermediate, which we will call Compound A. In the second step, Compound A is isolated and then hydrolyzed using dilute aqueous sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$).

A racemic mixture of a pair of enantiomers is formed.\n\nC. A single, optically active chiral compound is formed.\n\nD. A pair of diastereomers is formed in unequal amounts.\n\nE. No reaction occurs in the second step.", "solution": "Step 1 (epoxidation): cis-3-hexene is an internal alkene with identical substituents (ethyl groups) on each alkene carbon and one hydrogen on each alkene carbon. Reaction with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid proceeds by a concerted, stereospecific syn epoxidation. A cis-disubstituted alkene gives a cis-epoxide, preserving the relative stereochemistry of substituents. Because the alkene is symmetrically disubstituted (ethyl on both alkene carbons), the resulting epoxide (3,4-epoxyhexane) possesses an internal mirror plane and is meso (achiral). This epoxide is Compound A.\n\nStep 2 (acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the epoxide): In dilute aqueous sulfuric acid, the epoxide is first protonated at oxygen to form an oxonium ion. Nucleophilic attack by water then occurs with backside attack at an epoxide carbon, opening the ring with inversion at the attacked carbon. Under acidic conditions, in an unsymmetrical epoxide attack is favored at the more substituted carbon; here, both epoxide carbons are equivalent, so attack occurs at either carbon with equal probability. The opening is anti relative to the departing C–O bond, giving overall anti addition of two hydroxyl groups across the original double bond. Therefore, the product is the trans-1,2-diol, specifically trans-3,4-hexanediol.\n\nStereochemical outcome: Anti dihydroxylation of a cis-disubstituted, symmetrical alkene produces a pair of enantiomers in equal amounts (a racemic mixture). Although the epoxide intermediate is meso, its acid-catalyzed, anti opening can occur from either face to give enantiomeric trans diols with no internal plane of symmetry. Thus, the final product mixture is racemic.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that a racemic mixture of a pair of enantiomers is formed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2155051"}, {"introduction": "Real-world synthesis often involves substrates that are not perfectly symmetrical, introducing the challenge of regioselectivity. This problem builds upon the previous concepts by using an unsymmetrical cyclic alkene. You must now consider not only the stereochemistry of the ring-opening but also its regiochemistry—predicting which carbon of the epoxide intermediate will be attacked by the nucleophile under acidic conditions [@problem_id:2155065].", "problem": "A standard synthetic route to obtain trans-diols is the anti-dihydroxylation of an alkene. This transformation is typically carried out in a two-step sequence. First, the alkene is treated with a peroxyacid, such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA), to form an epoxide. Second, the epoxide intermediate is subjected to hydrolysis in the presence of an acid catalyst (e.g., $H_3O^+$), which opens the ring to yield the diol.\n\nConsider the application of this reaction sequence to 1-methylcyclohexene. The starting alkene is achiral. The reaction proceeds through the aforementioned epoxide intermediate, which is then hydrolyzed.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the major organic product(s) formed in this reaction sequence?\n\nA. A single, optically active, chiral diol is formed.\n\nB. A single, optically inactive, achiral (meso) diol is formed.\n\nC. A racemic mixture of two enantiomeric diols is formed.\n\nD. An unequal mixture of two diastereomeric diols is formed.\n\nE. The reaction sequence does not yield a diol product.", "solution": "The reaction sequence is epoxidation of the alkene followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the epoxide. For 1-methylcyclohexene:\n\n1) Epoxidation with m-CPBA is a stereospecific syn addition across the planar $C=C$ bond. Because 1-methylcyclohexene is achiral and its two faces are enantiotopic, epoxidation from the two faces yields a pair of enantiomeric epoxides in equal amounts. With achiral reagents, no enantiomeric excess can arise, so the epoxide intermediate is formed as a racemic mixture.\n\n2) Under acid-catalyzed conditions (e.g., $H_3O^+$), ring opening of a protonated epoxide proceeds by nucleophilic attack at the more substituted carbon due to greater stabilization of the developing positive charge. Here, water attacks preferentially at C1 (the more substituted epoxide carbon), and the attack is anti to the leaving C–O bond, giving overall anti opening. After deprotonation, this yields a trans-1,2-diol at C1 and C2.\n\n3) Because the starting material is achiral and all reagents are achiral, and because the two epoxide enantiomers each give a corresponding diol enantiomer via stereospecific anti opening, the final diol is formed as a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric, trans-1,2-diols.\n\n4) Exclusions:\n- A is incorrect: an optically active single enantiomer cannot arise from an achiral substrate with achiral reagents.\n- B is incorrect: a meso diol would require an internal symmetry plane, which is broken by the 1-methyl substituent; the product is not meso.\n- D is incorrect: the anti opening fixes the relative trans relationship; there is not an unequal mixture of diastereomeric trans diols under these conditions; the two products are enantiomers.\n- E is incorrect: the sequence does yield a diol.\n\nTherefore, the major product outcome is a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-1,2-diols.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2155065"}]}
