This substitution pattern is the hallmark outcome of adding two equivalents of a dihalogen across a carbon-carbon triple bond.\n\nKey reaction principle: Electrophilic addition of halogens to multiple bonds proceeds stepwise. For an alkyne, addition of one equivalent of chlorine gas forms a 1,2-dichloroalkene (typically the trans vinyl dihalide), and addition of a second equivalent of chlorine across the resulting double bond yields a saturated tetrahalide in which each of the two original alkyne carbons bears two halogens.\n\nApplication to pent-2-yne: Pent-2-yne has the triple bond between C2 and C3. Subjecting pent-2-yne to two or more equivalents of chlorine gas in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane accomplishes the sequence described above, leading specifically to 2,2,3,3-tetrachloropentane as the exclusive major product because both additions occur across C2 and C3 and dichloromethane does not interfere.\n\nAssessment of options:\nA. Pent-2-yne with two or more equivalents of Cl2 in CH2Cl2 follows the halogenation pathway described, giving the exact target 2,2,3,3-tetrachloropentane with high selectivity.\nB. Pent-1-yne with two or more equivalents of Cl2 would furnish 1,1,2,2-tetrachloropentane, placing the geminal dichlorides on C1 and C2 rather than C2 and C3; this does not match the target regiochemistry.\nC. Radical chlorination of pentane under UV light produces a complex mixture of mono- and poly-chlorinated products at various positions via a radical chain mechanism, not selectively the desired 2,2,3,3-tetrachloropentane.\nD. One equivalent of Cl2 added to pent-2-yne stops at the dichloroalkene stage (a 2,3-dichloropent-2-ene), not the saturated tetrachloroalkane.\nE. Addition of HCl to alkynes gives hydrohalogenation products; with two equivalents, an alkyne yields a geminal dichloride on a single carbon (for an unsymmetrical internal alkyne, a mixture of regioisomers), and in any case incorporates only two chlorine atoms total, not four, so it cannot produce a tetrachloroalkane.\n\nTherefore, only option A efficiently and selectively yields 2,2,3,3-tetrachloropentane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2174210"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basics, this practice introduces the critical dimension of stereochemistry.

The sequence is constrained: 1) Halogenation with $Br_2$, then 2) A second reaction to form the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the appropriate starting alkyne.**\nThe target molecule is *meso*-2,3-dibromobutane. The carbon backbone is a four-carbon chain (butane), and the functional groups (bromine atoms) are located at positions C2 and C3. To produce this substitution pattern, the starting alkyne must have its triple bond between C2 and C3. A terminal alkyne like but-1-yne (triple bond between C1 and C2) would lead to functionalization at C1 and C2. Therefore, the correct starting alkyne is the internal alkyne, but-2-yne. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the stereochemistry of the first reaction (Halogenation).**\nThe first step is the reaction of but-2-yne with one equivalent of bromine ($Br_2$). The electrophilic addition of a halogen like $Br_2$ to an alkyne is a stereospecific *anti*-addition. The mechanism proceeds through a cyclic bromonium ion intermediate, which is then attacked by a bromide ion ($Br^-$) from the side opposite to the bridge.\n\nStarting with the linear but-2-yne molecule, the two bromine atoms add to opposite faces of the forming double bond. This results in the formation of the *trans*-isomer of the dihaloalkene.\n$$\n\\text{CH}_3\\text{–C}{\\equiv}\\text{C–CH}_3 + \\text{Br}_2 \\longrightarrow (E)\\text{-2,3-dibromobut-2-ene}\n$$\nThe intermediate product is the (*E*)-isomer, which is a *trans*-alkene with respect to the two bromine atoms and the two methyl groups.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry of the second reaction.**\nThe second step must convert the intermediate, (*E*)-2,3-dibromobut-2-ene, into the final product, *meso*-2,3-dibromobutane. This is a hydrogenation reaction, where two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond. We must determine the stereochemical requirement for this addition to yield a *meso* product from a *trans* (*E*) alkene.\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of additions to alkenes follows a well-defined pattern. For an addition reaction that creates two new stereocenters:\n- *trans*-alkene + *syn*-addition → *meso*-compound\n- *trans*-alkene + *anti*-addition → racemic mixture\n- *cis*-alkene + *syn*-addition → racemic mixture\n- *cis*-alkene + *anti*-addition → *meso*-compound\n\nSince our intermediate is a *trans*-alkene ((E)-2,3-dibromobut-2-ene) and our desired product is the *meso*-compound, we require a *syn*-addition of hydrogen.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the correct reagent for the second step.**\nWe need to choose a reagent that performs *syn*-hydrogenation.\n- Na in liquid $NH_3$ (Option B) is a dissolving metal reduction used to reduce alkynes to *trans*-alkenes. It is not used for hydrogenating alkenes in this context.\n- $HBr$ with peroxides (ROOR) (Option E) causes the radical *anti*-Markovnikov addition of H and Br, not H and H. It is not a hydrogenation reaction.\n- $H_2$ with Lindlar's catalyst (Option A) is used for the *syn*-hydrogenation of alkynes to *cis*-alkenes. The catalyst is \"poisoned\" and not effective for reducing the more stable alkene double bond.\n- Catalytic hydrogenation using $H_2$ gas with a metal catalyst such as Palladium on carbon (Pd/C), Platinum ($PtO_2$), or Nickel (Ni) is the standard method for *syn*-addition of hydrogen to an alkene. The alkene adsorbs onto the flat surface of the catalyst, and both hydrogen atoms are delivered from the catalyst surface to the same face of the double bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct reagent for the second step is $H_2$ with a catalyst like Pd/C.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe correct synthesis is:\n1.  but-2-yne + $Br_2$ → (E)-2,3-dibromobut-2-ene (*anti*-addition)\n2.  (E)-2,3-dibromobut-2-ene + $H_2$/Pd/C → *meso*-2,3-dibromobutane (*syn*-addition)\n\nThis corresponds to Option D, which specifies the starting material as but-2-yne and the reagent for the second step as $H_2$, Pd/C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2174226"}, {"introduction": "How do chemists determine the intricate steps of a reaction mechanism?
