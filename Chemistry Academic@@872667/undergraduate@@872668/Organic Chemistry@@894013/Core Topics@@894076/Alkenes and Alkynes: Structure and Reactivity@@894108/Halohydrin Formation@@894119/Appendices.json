{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The outcome of an electrophilic addition reaction to an alkene can be dramatically altered by the choice of solvent. This first exercise highlights the crucial role the solvent plays by comparing the reaction of 1-butene with bromine in both a nucleophilic solvent (water) and an inert one (carbon tetrachloride). By analyzing these two scenarios, you will solidify your understanding of the competition between potential nucleophiles and learn to predict when halohydrin formation occurs versus simple dihalogenation [@problem_id:2174405].", "problem": "An undergraduate student is investigating the electrophilic addition of bromine to 1-butene under different solvent conditions.

Number the chain so that the terminal alkene carbon is C1 and the internal alkene carbon is C2.\n\nExperiment 1 (Br2 in H2O): The alkene undergoes electrophilic addition with Br2 to form a three-membered bromonium ion bridging C1 and C2. In aqueous solution, water is a nucleophile present in large excess and attacks the bromonium ion. The bromonium intermediate has greater carbocation-like character at the more substituted carbon (C2), so water attacks C2. Ring opening occurs with anti addition, giving after deprotonation an alcohol at C2 and bromine at C1. Neglecting stereochemistry, the product is 1-bromobutan-2-ol (OH at C2, Br at C1), consistent with Markovnikov orientation for halohydrin formation.\n\nExperiment 2 (Br2 in CCl4): The alkene reacts with Br2 to form a bromonium ion, and in an inert, non-nucleophilic solvent such as CCl4, the nucleophile is $Br^-$. Bromide opens the bromonium ion with anti addition across the double bond, placing bromine on both C1 and C2 to give the vicinal dibromide 1,2-dibromobutane. No rearrangement occurs because the mechanism proceeds via a bridged halonium ion rather than a free carbocation.\n\nThus, $P_{1}$ is 1-bromobutan-2-ol and $P_{2}$ is 1,2-dibromobutane, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2174405"}, {"introduction": "With a grasp of the conditions that favor halohydrin formation, the next step is to predict the precise structure of the product.

The reactants are 1-methylcyclopentene, an unsymmetrical alkene, and bromine ($Br_2$) in water ($H_2O$), a nucleophilic solvent. The reaction proceeds through a multi-step electrophilic addition mechanism.\n\nStep 1: Electrophilic attack and formation of the bromonium ion.\nThe $\\pi$ bond of the alkene acts as a nucleophile and attacks a molecule of bromine ($Br_2$). This is an electrophilic addition. The bromine molecule becomes polarized as it approaches the electron-rich double bond. The attack expels a bromide ion ($Br^-$) and forms a cyclic, three-membered ring intermediate called a bridged bromonium ion. This intermediate forms across the two carbons of the original double bond. The formation of this bridged ion prevents carbocation rearrangements and is key to determining the stereochemistry of the product.\n\nStep 2: Regioselective nucleophilic attack.\nThe reaction medium contains water ($H_2O$), which is a nucleophile. In the bromonium ion intermediate, the positive charge is shared between the bromine atom and the two carbon atoms. The carbon atoms bear a partial positive charge. Because 1-methylcyclopentene is unsymmetrical, the two carbons of the original double bond are not equivalent. One carbon is tertiary (bonded to the methyl group and two other carbons in the ring), and the other is secondary (bonded to two other carbons in the ring). The tertiary carbon can better stabilize a positive charge than the secondary carbon. Consequently, the transition state for the nucleophilic attack has more carbocation-like character at the more substituted (tertiary) carbon. According to Markovnikov's rule for halohydrin formation, the nucleophile (water) will preferentially attack the more substituted carbon atom. In this case, water attacks the tertiary carbon (C1 of the original alkene).\n\nStep 3: Stereoselective nucleophilic attack.\nThe nucleophile ($H_2O$) must attack the bromonium ion from the side opposite to the bulky bromine bridge. This is known as an anti-addition. The attack opens the three-membered ring. This results in the bromine atom and the incoming nucleophile's group being on opposite faces of the cyclopentane ring, leading to a *trans* configuration. So, the oxygen from the water molecule will be *trans* to the bromine atom.\n\nStep 4: Deprotonation.\nAfter the water molecule attacks the tertiary carbon, it forms an oxonium ion intermediate (a positively charged oxygen atom with three bonds). A base, which can be another water molecule or the bromide ion ($Br^-$) formed in the first step, removes a proton from the oxonium ion. This deprotonation yields the final neutral halohydrin product, which is an alcohol.\n\nStep 5: Naming the final product.\nCombining the outcomes of the previous steps:\n- The bromine atom is attached to the less substituted carbon (C2 of the original double bond).\n- The hydroxyl (–OH) group is attached to the more substituted carbon (C1 of the original double bond).\n- The –OH and –Br groups are in a *trans* relationship.\n\nTo name the product using IUPAC rules:\n1.  The parent ring is cyclopentane.\n2.  The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the suffix is \"-ol\".\n3.  Numbering of the ring starts at the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH group) to give it the lowest possible locant. This is C1.\n4.  The methyl group is also on C1.\n5.  The bromine atom is on the adjacent carbon, which becomes C2.\n6.  Assembling the name gives: 2-bromo-1-methylcyclopentan-1-ol.\n7.  The stereochemistry is *trans*, as established in Step 3.\n\nTherefore, the major product is *trans*-2-bromo-1-methylcyclopentan-1-ol.
