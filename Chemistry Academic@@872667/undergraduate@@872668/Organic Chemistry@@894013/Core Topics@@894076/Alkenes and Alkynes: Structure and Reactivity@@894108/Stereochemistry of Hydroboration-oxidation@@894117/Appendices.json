In the oxidation step with $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}_2, \\text{NaOH}$, the $C-B$ bond is converted to a $C-O$ bond with retention of configuration at carbon, so the overall addition of H and OH is syn.\n\nApply this to 1-methylcyclopentene, which has the double bond between C1 and C2 and a methyl substituent on C1:\n- Hydroboration places B at C2 (less substituted) and H at C1 (more substituted), in a syn fashion from one face of the alkene.\n- Oxidation converts C2–B to C2–OH with retention of configuration. Therefore, H at C1 and OH at C2 are installed on the same face of the ring (syn addition across the former double bond).\n\nThe product has new stereocenters at C1 and C2:\n- At C1, after addition, the substituents are $H$ (new), $\\text{CH}_3$, and two different ring paths, making C1 stereogenic.\n- At C2, after addition, the substituents are $OH$ (new), $H$, and two different ring paths, making C2 stereogenic.\n\nBecause the syn addition can occur from either the top or bottom face of the alkene with equal probability and there is no internal plane of symmetry (the substituents at C1 and C2 are different, e.g., $\\text{CH}_3$ versus $OH$), the two products formed are non-superimposable mirror images. No other diastereomeric products are formed because the mechanism enforces syn addition and fixed regiochemistry.

This problem will sharpen your ability to scrutinize a starting material's structure, as you will see how the placement of a double bond—whether endocyclic or exocyclic—is the critical factor in determining if the final product is chiral or achiral.", "problem": "Two separate hydroboration-oxidation reactions are conducted. Reaction 1 starts with methylenecyclohexane, and Reaction 2 starts with 1-methylcyclohexene.

Reaction 1 yields an achiral product, and Reaction 2 yields a racemic mixture of a chiral product.\n\nD.

Subsequent oxidation by $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}_2/\\text{NaOH}$ replaces $B$ with $OH$ with retention of configuration at carbon. Thus, the overall result is syn addition of $H$ and $OH$ with anti-Markovnikov regiochemistry.\n\nReaction 1: Methylenecyclohexane has an exocyclic terminal double bond between a ring carbon and a methylene ($=\\text{CH}_2$). Anti-Markovnikov addition places $\\text{BH}_2$ (then $OH$) at the exocyclic methylene carbon and $H$ at the ring carbon. The product is a hydroxymethyl substituent attached to the ring, i.e., cyclohexylmethanol. The exocyclic carbon becomes $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ and is not stereogenic (it bears two identical $H$). The adjacent ring carbon bonded to this substituent is also not stereogenic in a monosubstituted cyclohexane because the two paths around the ring are identical by symmetry. Therefore, Reaction 1 yields a single achiral product.\n\nReaction 2: 1-Methylcyclohexene has the double bond within the ring between C1 and C2, with a methyl substituent at C1. Anti-Markovnikov regiochemistry places $OH$ at C2 and $H$ at C1, and syn addition enforces that these are delivered to the same face of the ring. In the product, both C1 (bearing $H$ added, preexisting $\\text{CH}_3$, and two distinct ring paths) and C2 (bearing $OH$, $H$, and two distinct ring paths) are stereogenic. Because the substrate is achiral and there is no internal symmetry (the methyl substituent breaks any symmetry that could give a meso form), approach from either face of the alkene gives a pair of enantiomers in equal amounts. Thus, Reaction 2 yields a racemic mixture of a chiral product.\n\nTherefore, Reaction 1 gives an achiral product, and Reaction 2 gives a racemic mixture of a chiral product.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2201963"}, {"introduction": "A true test of understanding is the ability to work backward from a desired product to the necessary starting material. This problem [@problem_id:2201926] presents a synthetic puzzle: you must identify an alkene that, upon hydroboration-oxidation, yields a single, achiral alcohol.

(Z)-Hex-2-ene", "solution": "The problem asks to identify an alkene with the formula $C_6H_{12}$ that yields a single, achiral alcohol upon hydroboration-oxidation. Let's analyze the key features of this reaction and the required properties of the product. The hydroboration-oxidation reaction proceeds in two steps. The first step, hydroboration, involves the addition of a borane (like $\\text{BH}_3$) across the double bond. This addition is regioselective, following an anti-Markovnikov pattern, where the boron atom adds to the less sterically hindered (less substituted) carbon of the double bond. The addition is also stereospecific, occurring via a syn-addition, where the boron and the hydrogen atom add to the same face of the alkene. The second step, oxidation, replaces the boron atom with a hydroxyl ($-OH$) group with retention of stereochemistry. The net result is the syn-addition of $H$ and $OH$ across the double bond, with the $OH$ group on the less substituted carbon.\n\nThe product must be a \"single, achiral alcohol\".\n- \"Single\" implies that the reaction produces predominantly one constitutional isomer and that this product is not a mixture of stereoisomers (like a racemic mixture).\n- \"Achiral\" means the product molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically true for molecules that lack a stereocenter or for meso compounds which possess an internal plane of symmetry despite having stereocenters.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. (E)-Hex-3-ene: The structure is $CH_3CH_2CH=CHCH_2CH_3$. This is a symmetrically substituted internal alkene. Hydroboration can occur at either C-3 or C-4, but due to the molecule's symmetry, both additions lead to the same constitutional isomer: hexan-3-ol ($CH_3CH_2CH(OH)CH_2CH_2CH_3$). So, a single constitutional isomer is formed. However, C-3 in hexan-3-ol is a stereocenter (it is bonded to four different groups: H, OH, ethyl, and propyl). Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction will produce a racemic mixture of (R)-hexan-3-ol and (S)-hexan-3-ol. This is a mixture of two enantiomers, not a single product. Thus, A is incorrect.\n\nB. 2-Methylpent-2-ene: The structure is $CH_3C(CH_3)=CHCH_2CH_3$. This is an unsymmetrical, trisubstituted alkene. According to the anti-Markovnikov rule, the boron atom will add to the less substituted carbon of the double bond, which is C-3. Oxidation then yields 2-methylpentan-3-ol ($CH_3CH(CH_3)CH(OH)CH_2CH_3$). The product molecule has two stereocenters: C-2 and C-3. The syn-addition mechanism leads to the formation of a specific pair of enantiomers (one diastereomer). The result is a racemic mixture. This is not a single, achiral product. Thus, B is incorrect.\n\nC. 2,3-Dimethylbut-2-ene: The structure is $(CH_3)_2C=C(CH_3)_2$. This is a symmetrically substituted, tetrasubstituted alkene. Due to its symmetry, the addition of the hydroxyl group to either of the double-bonded carbons (C-2 or C-3) results in the same product: 2,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol, which has the structure $(CH_3)_2C(OH)-CH(CH_3)_2$. Let's examine the product for chirality. The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (C-2) is bonded to an OH group, an isopropyl group ($(CH(CH_3)_2)$), and two methyl groups. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a stereocenter. No other carbon in the molecule is a stereocenter. Therefore, the product is achiral. The reaction produces one product, 2,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol, which is achiral. This matches the conditions specified in the problem. Thus, C is the correct answer.\n\nD. 1-Methylcyclopentene: This is a cyclic, trisubstituted alkene. The double bond is between C-1 (which has a methyl group) and C-2. Boron will add to the less substituted carbon, C-2. Subsequent oxidation gives 2-methylcyclopentanol. In the product, both C-1 (bearing the methyl group) and C-2 (bearing the hydroxyl group) are stereocenters. The syn-addition of H and OH results in the formation of cis-2-methylcyclopentanol. Since the starting alkene is achiral, a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers of cis-2-methylcyclopentanol is formed. This is a mixture of chiral molecules, not a single achiral product. Thus, D is incorrect.\n\nE. (Z)-Hex-2-ene: The structure is $CH_3CH=CHCH_2CH_2CH_3$. The double bond is between two non-equivalent secondary carbons. Hydroboration of such an alkene is not highly regioselective and will produce a mixture of two constitutional isomers: hexan-2-ol and hexan-3-ol. Both of these alcohols are chiral, so the final product is a complex mixture of at least four different stereoisomers (two pairs of enantiomers). This clearly does not meet the condition of a single product. Thus, E is incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2201926"}]}
