This first practice explores the free-radical chlorination of an alkane, a reaction known for its relatively low selectivity. You will calculate the expected product distribution by considering two key factors: the statistical probability of a chlorine radical encountering a specific type of hydrogen and the inherent, albeit moderate, reactivity differences between primary, secondary, and tertiary C-H bonds. This exercise [@problem_id:2196350] provides a foundational method for predicting outcomes in reactions where multiple products are possible.", "problem": "The photochemical monochlorination of an alkane is a classic example of a free-radical chain reaction. The distribution of the resulting monochlorinated constitutional isomers depends on both statistical factors (the number of available hydrogen atoms of each type) and the inherent reactivity of each type of carbon-hydrogen bond.\n\nConsider the monochlorination of 2-methylbutane. Under the specific reaction conditions employed, the relative rate of hydrogen atom abstraction by a chlorine radical for a tertiary C-H bond is 5.0, for a secondary C-H bond is 3.8, and for a primary C-H bond is 1.0.\n\nCalculate the fractional yield of 2-chloro-2-methylbutane relative to the total mixture of all possible monochlorinated constitutional isomers. Assume that the product distribution is governed solely by these statistical and reactivity factors. Provide your answer as a decimal value, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "For radical chlorination where product distribution is governed by both the number of abstractable hydrogens of each type and their relative reactivities, the fractional yield for substitution at a given type is proportional to the product of the number of such hydrogens and the corresponding relative rate.\n\nIn 2-methylbutane, the hydrogen counts by type are:\n- Tertiary: the central carbon (C-2) has $n_{t}=1$ hydrogen.\n- Secondary: the methylene carbon (C-3) has $n_{s}=2$ hydrogens.\n- Primary: the three methyl groups (C-1, C-4, and the methyl substituent on C-2) contribute $n_{p}=3+3+3=9$ hydrogens.\n\nGiven relative abstraction rates $k_{t}=5.0$, $k_{s}=3.8$, and $k_{p}=1.0$, the total weighted rate is\n$$\nR_{\\text{tot}}=n_{t}k_{t}+n_{s}k_{s}+n_{p}k_{p}=1\\cdot 5.0+2\\cdot 3.8+9\\cdot 1.0=5.0+7.6+9=21.6.\n$$\nThe product 2-chloro-2-methylbutane arises exclusively from abstraction at the tertiary site, so its fractional yield is\n$$\nf=\\frac{n_{t}k_{t}}{R_{\\text{tot}}}=\\frac{1\\cdot 5.0}{21.6}=\\frac{25}{108}\\approx 0.231481\\ldots\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $0.231$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.231}$$", "id": "2196350"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's contrast the behavior of chlorine with its heavier halogen counterpart, bromine. According to the Hammond postulate, the more endothermic hydrogen abstraction step in bromination leads to a later, more product-like transition state, making the bromine radical far more sensitive to the stability of the resulting radical intermediate. This practice [@problem_id:2196346] will ask you to perform a similar calculation to the one for chlorination, but with reactivity values that starkly favor the formation of the most substituted radical. By comparing your results here to the previous exercise, you'll gain a deep appreciation for why bromination is considered a highly selective and synthetically useful reaction.", "problem": "In an experiment studying regioselectivity, methylcyclopentane is subjected to free-radical monobromination using bromine ($Br_2$) in the presence of Ultraviolet (UV) light. Under the reaction conditions, the relative rates of abstraction for a tertiary (3°), secondary (2°), and primary (1°) hydrogen atom by a bromine radical are 1600, 82, and 1, respectively.

In this final practice, you'll step into the role of a detective in the lab. Rather than predicting the products from a given starting material, you are given the number of constitutional isomers formed during a monobromination reaction and asked to identify the structure of the parent alkane. This problem [@problem_id:2196383] requires you to analyze molecular symmetry and determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in several candidate molecules, a crucial skill in spectroscopy and structural analysis.", "problem": "An unknown acyclic alkane with the molecular formula $C_{6}H_{14}$ is subjected to free-radical bromination using bromine ($Br_2$) and ultraviolet (UV) light. The reaction is carefully controlled to favor the formation of monobrominated products. Upon analysis of the product mixture, it is determined that exactly two different constitutional isomers of monobromohexane are formed.\n\nBased on this experimental outcome, which of the following compounds is the starting alkane?\n\nA. n-Hexane\n\nB. 2-Methylpentane\n\nC. 3-Methylpentane\n\nD. 2,2-Dimethylbutane\n\nE. 2,3-Dimethylbutane", "solution": "The core principle guiding the solution is that in a free-radical halogenation reaction that produces monohalogenated products, the number of distinct constitutional isomers formed is equal to the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of hydrogen atoms in the starting alkane. Each unique set of hydrogen atoms provides a different site for halogen substitution, leading to a different constitutional isomer. We must analyze the structure of each of the given isomers of $C_{6}H_{14}$ to determine how many sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogens each contains.\n\nA. n-Hexane: The structure is $CH_{3}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{3}$. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry at the center, between C3 and C4. Due to this symmetry, certain positions are equivalent:\n- The hydrogens on C1 are equivalent to the hydrogens on C6. This is the first set.\n- The hydrogens on C2 are equivalent to the hydrogens on C5. This is the second set.\n- The hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to the hydrogens on C4. This is the third set.\nTherefore, n-hexane has 3 sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogens and would produce 3 monobrominated constitutional isomers. This does not match the experimental result.\n\nB. 2-Methylpentane: The structure is $(CH_{3})_{2}CH-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{3}$. This molecule lacks symmetry that would make different carbon atoms equivalent. We identify the unique sets of hydrogens:\n- The hydrogens on the two methyl groups attached to C2 are equivalent to each other due to free rotation around the C-C bond, but they are different from all other hydrogens. This is the first set.\n- The single hydrogen on C2 (a methine hydrogen) is unique. This is the second set.\n- The hydrogens on the C3 methylene group are unique. This is the third set.\n- The hydrogens on the C4 methylene group are unique. This is the fourth set.\n- The hydrogens on the C5 terminal methyl group are unique. This is the fifth set.\nTherefore, 2-methylpentane has 5 sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogens and would produce 5 monobrominated isomers. This does not match the experimental result.\n\nC. 3-Methylpentane: The structure is $CH_{3}-CH_{2}-CH(CH_{3})-CH_{2}-CH_{3}$. This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3, the hydrogen on C3, and the methyl group attached to C3 (when viewed in an appropriate conformation). This symmetry makes pairs of groups equivalent:\n- The hydrogens on the C1 and C5 methyl groups are equivalent. This is the first set.\n- The hydrogens on the C2 and C4 methylene groups are equivalent. This is the second set.\n- The single hydrogen on C3 is unique. This is the third set.\n- The hydrogens on the methyl group attached to C3 are unique. This is the fourth set.\nTherefore, 3-methylpentane has 4 sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogens and would produce 4 monobrominated isomers. This does not match the experimental result.\n\nD. 2,2-Dimethylbutane: The structure is $(CH_{3})_{3}C-CH_{2}-CH_{3}$. We identify the unique sets of hydrogens:\n- The hydrogens on the three methyl groups attached to the quaternary carbon (C2) are all equivalent due to free rotation. This is the first set. (Note: C2 itself has no hydrogens).\n- The hydrogens on the C3 methylene group are unique. This is the second set.\n- The hydrogens on the C4 terminal methyl group are unique. This is the third set.\nTherefore, 2,2-dimethylbutane has 3 sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogens and would produce 3 monobrominated isomers. This does not match the experimental result.\n\nE. 2,3-Dimethylbutane: The structure is $(CH_{3})_{2}CH-CH(CH_{3})_{2}$. This is a highly symmetrical molecule. It has a center of inversion and a C2 rotational axis through the midpoint of the C2-C3 bond.\n- Due to symmetry, the four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. The 12 hydrogens on these four methyl groups form a single set. This is the first set.\n- Also due to symmetry, the two methine hydrogens on C2 and C3 are chemically equivalent. These two hydrogens form a second set.\nTherefore, 2,3-dimethylbutane has exactly 2 sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogens. Monobromination would yield 1-bromo-2,3-dimethylbutane and 2-bromo-2,3-dimethylbutane. This matches the experimental observation of two constitutional isomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2196383"}]}
