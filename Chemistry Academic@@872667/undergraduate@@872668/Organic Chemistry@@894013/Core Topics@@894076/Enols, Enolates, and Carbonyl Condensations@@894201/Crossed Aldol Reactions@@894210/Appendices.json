The reaction is carefully controlled at a low temperature to isolate the initial addition product before any subsequent dehydration can occur. Your task is to identify the correct chemical structure of this major aldol addition product from the choices provided below.\n\nThe structures are represented using the Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES), a text-based notation for chemical species.

Acetophenone has alpha-hydrogens and forms its enolate under base (e.g., hydroxide), whereas p-anisaldehyde lacks alpha-hydrogens and therefore cannot form an enolate. Consequently, only acetophenone provides the enolate, and the electrophile is p-anisaldehyde.\n\nThe acetophenone enolate adds to the carbonyl carbon of p-anisaldehyde, forming a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha-carbon of acetophenone and the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. The immediate product is a benzylic alkoxide adjacent to a ketone. Under the reaction conditions, this alkoxide is protonated to give the aldol addition product, a beta-hydroxy ketone.\n\nKey structural features of the major product:\n- The original ketone carbonyl remains on the acetophenone ring, so the carbonyl carbon is attached to an unsubstituted phenyl ring.\n- The new carbon-carbon bond connects the acetophenone alpha-carbon to the former carbonyl carbon of p-anisaldehyde.\n- The aldehyde carbonyl is converted into a secondary alcohol, which is beta to the ketone.\n- Low temperature and careful control prevent dehydration; therefore, the product is the beta-hydroxy ketone, not the conjugated enone.\n\nTranslating this into a connectivity description, the product has the skeleton: acetophenone-derived ketone $-$ methylene $-$ secondary alcohol $-$ p-anisyl ring, i.e., Ph$-$CO$-$CH$_{2}$–CH(OH)–Ar(OMe-p). In SMILES terms, this corresponds to O=C(c1ccccc1)CC(O)c1ccc(OC)cc1.\n\nAnalysis of the options:\n- A, O=C(c1ccccc1)C=Cc1ccc(OC)cc1, is the dehydrated enone (aldol condensation) product, not the isolated aldol addition product.\n- B, O=C(c1ccc(OC)cc1)CC(O)c1ccccc1, places the ketone carbonyl on the anisyl ring rather than on the acetophenone phenyl ring; this does not match the reaction outcome.\n- C, O=C(c1ccccc1)CC(O)(C)c1ccccc1, has a tertiary alcohol and lacks the anisyl methoxy group; it does not match the expected product.\n- D, O=C(c1ccccc1)CC(O)c1ccc(OC)cc1, exactly matches the beta-hydroxy ketone with the ketone carbonyl on the acetophenone ring and the secondary alcohol attached to the p-anisyl ring.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2164524"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic principle, we now address a more complex and common challenge: regioselectivity. What happens when the nucleophilic partner has more than one type of $\\alpha$-hydrogen? This exercise demonstrates how chemists exert precise control over a reaction's outcome by manipulating reaction conditions. You will explore how using a sterically hindered base at low temperature favors the formation of the *kinetic enolate*, guiding the reaction to a specific site to produce the desired isomer [@problem_id:2164503].", "problem": "In a laboratory synthesis, a chemist aims to perform a directed crossed aldol reaction. The procedure begins by dissolving 2-methylcyclohexanone in a suitable aprotic solvent and cooling the solution to -78 °C. Subsequently, one equivalent of lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is added, and the mixture is stirred for a short period to ensure complete formation of the lithium enolate. Finally, an excess of acetaldehyde ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CHO}$) is introduced into the reaction flask, followed by an aqueous workup to neutralize the mixture and isolate the product.\n\nAssuming the reaction proceeds under kinetic control, identify the major organic product formed in this sequence from the options below.\n\nA. 6-(1-Hydroxyethyl)-2-methylcyclohexan-1-one\n\nB. 2-(1-Hydroxyethyl)-2-methylcyclohexan-1-one\n\nC. 1-Hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(propan-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nD. 2-Methyl-6-(2-methylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nE. 2-Methyl-6-ethylidenecyclohexan-1-one", "solution": "The substrate 2-methylcyclohexanone has two sets of acidic $\\alpha$-hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl at C1: at C2 (which bears a methyl substituent) and at C6 (the less substituted side). Under the stated directed aldol conditions—strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base (one equivalent of LDA), aprotic solvent, and low temperature—the deprotonation is irreversible and is governed by kinetic control. The kinetic enolate forms faster at the less substituted, more accessible $\\alpha$-position due to lower steric hindrance; therefore, LDA selectively removes an $\\alpha$-hydrogen at C6 to give the less substituted lithium enolate with C1-C6 enolate formation.\n\nWith the preformed C6-enolate, addition of excess $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CHO}$ (acetaldehyde) ensures that the enolate reacts with the aldehyde rather than undergoing self-aldol reactions. The enolate carbon at C6 attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of acetaldehyde to form a new C–C bond, generating an alkoxide at the aldehyde oxygen (the aldolate). Subsequent aqueous workup protonates this alkoxide to furnish the $\\beta$-hydroxy ketone. Regiochemically, this places a 1-hydroxyethyl group at C6 of the cyclohexanone ring, while the original methyl substituent remains at C2 and the ketone at C1. Thus, the product is the aldol addition product 6-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-methylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\nAlternative options are disfavored under these conditions: formation via the more substituted (thermodynamic) enolate at C2 would lead to substitution at C2 (option B), but this requires thermodynamic control (higher temperature or less hindered base). Dehydration to the enone (option E) represents the aldol condensation product; under cold, directed aldol conditions with a simple aqueous workup, the $\\beta$-hydroxy ketone is typically isolated rather than the dehydrated enone. The dimeric or unrelated structures in options C and D are inconsistent with the directed crossed aldol described. Therefore, the major product under kinetic control is 6-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-methylcyclohexan-1-one.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2164503"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of a reaction mechanism allows chemists not only to predict products but also to explain the precise fate of every atom. This final practice uses isotopic labeling—a powerful technique in physical organic chemistry—to track atoms through the entire aldol condensation sequence. By following the path of deuterium atoms from the starting material to the final $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated product, you will gain an intimate understanding of the deprotonation and elimination steps that define the aldol condensation mechanism [@problem_id:2164514].", "problem": "Consider the following two-step reaction sequence. In the first step, cyclopentanone is dissolved in a solvent mixture of deuterium oxide ($\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$) and a catalytic amount of sodium deuteroxide ($\\text{NaOD}$), and is stirred until isotopic exchange equilibrium is reached. The resulting deuterated ketone is then isolated. In the second step, this isolated ketone is reacted with benzaldehyde in the presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide catalyst with gentle heating to yield a single major alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone product, which is the final aldol condensation product.\n\nLet the final product be named according to standard IUPAC nomenclature for cyclic ketones, with the carbonyl carbon designated as C1 and the carbon atoms of the ring numbered sequentially.

Reversible deprotonation at each $\\alpha$ carbon forms the enolate, and reprotonation from the deuterated solvent on carbon gives H/D exchange. Because $C2$ and $C5$ are equivalent and each is a $\\text{CH}_2$ in cyclopentanone, repeated enolization until isotopic equilibrium replaces all four $\\alpha$ hydrogens with deuterium, yielding the isolated 2,2,5,5-tetradeutero-cyclopentanone (i.e., $C2=\\text{CD}_2$ and $C5=\\text{CD}_2$).\n\nStep 2: In the aldol condensation with benzaldehyde under aqueous $\\text{NaOH}$, the reactive $\\alpha$ carbon that forms the new C-C bond is deprotonated first. Choosing $C2$ (the two sites are equivalent), $\\text{OH}^-$ removes one $D$ from $C2$ to give the enolate, which attacks the benzaldehyde carbonyl carbon to form the $\\beta$-alkoxide; protonation of that alkoxide by water gives the $\\beta$-hydroxy ketone. Dehydration then occurs by an E1cb mechanism: base again removes the remaining $D$ at $C2$ to form the enolate, and loss of hydroxide gives the exocyclic C=C bond between $C2$ and the former aldehyde carbon. Consequently, both deuteriums originally at $C2$ are consumed in the two deprotonation steps and are not present in the product; $C2$ in the enone bears no hydrogen or deuterium. The vinylic hydrogen on the exocyclic (benzylic) carbon in the product originates from the aldehyde’s formyl hydrogen and is not replaced by deuterium in this sequence.\n\nThe other $\\alpha$ position, $C5$, does not participate in bond formation or elimination during the condensation, so there is no mechanistic requirement to remove its deuteriums. Thus, the two deuterium atoms at $C5$ from the first step are retained in the final major product.\n\nTherefore, the final product contains two deuterium atoms, both located at $C5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2164514"}]}
