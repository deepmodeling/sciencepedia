By correctly identifying the structure as cyclic, planar, and fully conjugated, and then counting the π electrons in this charged species, you can predict its electronic properties and relative stability.", "problem": "A chemist is investigating the properties of a series of cyclic, planar, fully conjugated hydrocarbon ions to understand their relative stability based on electronic structure. One of the species under investigation is the cyclopentadienyl cation, C₅H₅⁺. To predict its properties, the chemist considers the applicability of Hückel's criteria for aromaticity.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly classifies the cyclopentadienyl cation and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. Aromatic, because it is a cyclic, planar, fully conjugated system with 4 π-electrons, which follows the 4n rule for aromaticity.\n\nB. Antiaromatic, because it is a cyclic, planar, fully conjugated system with 4 π-electrons, which follows the 4n rule for antiaromaticity (where n=1).\n\nC. Nonaromatic, because the molecule is not cyclic and planar, thus failing one of the primary criteria for aromaticity or antiaromaticity.\n\nD. Aromatic, because it has 5 π-electrons (one from each of the five carbons), which is an odd number, making it a stable radical cation.\n\nE. Nonaromatic, because as a charged species, it cannot be aromatic or antiaromatic, which are properties reserved for neutral molecules.\n\nF. Antiaromatic, because it has 6 π-electrons (one from each carbon plus one for the charge), which follows the 4n+2 rule, but the charge introduces instability.", "solution": "We apply Hückel’s criteria. A monocyclic, planar, fully conjugated system is:\n- Aromatic if the number of delocalized electrons satisfies $N_{\\pi}=4n+2$, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer.\n- Antiaromatic if $N_{\\pi}=4n$ under the same structural conditions.\n- Nonaromatic if the system is not cyclic, not planar, or not fully conjugated.\n\nFor the cyclopentadienyl cation, C5H5+, the ring can be treated as a five-membered, planar, fully conjugated system in which each carbon is $sp^{2}$ hybridized with a $p$ orbital. The $\\pi$-electron count proceeds as follows:\n- There are five $p$ orbitals around the ring (one per carbon).\n- The neutral cyclopentadienyl radical would have $5$ $\\pi$ electrons (one from each carbon). Removing one electron to form the cation yields\n$$\nN_{\\pi}=5-1=4.\n$$\nEquivalently, in a resonance picture with two C=C bonds and one carbocation center, the two double bonds provide $4$ $\\pi$ electrons, and the positively charged carbon contributes zero $\\pi$ electrons.\n\nSince $N_{\\pi}=4=4\\times 1$, the system meets the $4n$ condition with $n=1$ under cyclic, planar, fully conjugated conditions, so it is antiaromatic.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification and reasoning are given by option B, and the other options are incorrect because:\n- A incorrectly assigns aromaticity to a $4n$ electron count.\n- C incorrectly claims failure of cyclic planarity/conjugation.\n- D miscounts the $\\pi$ electrons and invokes an irrelevant odd-electron radical rationale.\n- E is false because charged species can be aromatic or antiaromatic (e.g., cyclopentadienyl anion is aromatic).\n- F miscounts electrons and misapplies the $4n+2$ rule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2184498"}, {"introduction": "While Hückel's rules provide a quick way to predict aromaticity, a true understanding comes from examining the underlying molecular orbital energy diagram.

The remaining two electrons must occupy the next available level, which is the degenerate pair $E_{1}$ and $E_{3}$.
