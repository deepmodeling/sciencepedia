In this practice problem [@problem_id:2210740], you will act as a chemical detective, using the outcome of an iodoform test in conjunction with other chemical evidence, such as stereochemical properties, to piece together the structure of an unknown compound. This exercise demonstrates how specific reactions provide crucial clues in solving complex molecular puzzles.", "problem": "An unknown organic compound, designated as Compound A, has the molecular formula $C_6H_{12}O$. It is subjected to a series of chemical tests to determine its structure.\n\n1.  Treatment of Compound A with an excess of aqueous iodine ($\\mathrm{I_2}$) and sodium hydroxide ($\\mathrm{NaOH}$) results in the formation of a pale yellow precipitate, iodoform ($\\mathrm{CHI_3}$), and a water-soluble carboxylate salt.\n2.  This carboxylate salt, upon careful acidification with a mineral acid, is converted into a carboxylic acid, designated Compound B.\n3.  An analysis of Compound B reveals that it is a chiral molecule; that is, it can exist as a pair of enantiomers.\n4.  When Compound A is treated with the reducing agent sodium borohydride ($\\mathrm{NaBH_4}$) in methanol, followed by a standard aqueous acid workup, a mixture of diastereomeric alcohol products is obtained.\n\nBased on this complete set of observations, determine the unique structure of Compound A. Provide the name for this compound according to the nomenclature rules of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).", "solution": "The molecular formula $C_6H_{12}O$ has one degree of unsaturation, since the index of hydrogen deficiency is computed as $\\frac{2\\times 6+2-12}{2}=1$. This is consistent with a single double bond or a ring; in the context of the tests, a carbonyl group is strongly indicated.\n\nThe formation of iodoform ($\\mathrm{CHI_3}$) with $\\mathrm{I_2/NaOH}$ along with a water-soluble carboxylate salt is the hallmark of the haloform reaction. This requires a methyl ketone functionality, i.e., a substrate of the form $\\mathrm{R-CO-CH_3}$ (or a secondary alcohol of the form $\\mathrm{CH_3-CH(OH)-R}$ that is oxidized in situ to the corresponding methyl ketone). Because Compound A is subsequently reduced by $\\mathrm{NaBH_4}$ to give alcohols, A must itself be a carbonyl compound (secondary alcohols are not reduced by $\\mathrm{NaBH_4}$), so A is a methyl ketone:\n$$\n\\text{A} = \\mathrm{R-CO-CH_3}.\n$$\nUnder the haloform conditions, a methyl ketone gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{R-CO-CH_3} \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{I_2},\\,\\text{base}} \\mathrm{RCOO^-} + \\mathrm{CHI_3}.\n$$\nAcidification of the carboxylate yields $\\mathrm{RCOOH}$ (Compound B). We are told B is chiral, i.e., it possesses a stereogenic center and exists as enantiomers.\n\nFor A with formula $C_6H_{12}O$ and being a methyl ketone, we have $R$ as a butyl group ($\\mathrm{C_4H_9}$), so the possible $R$ are the four butyl isomers, leading to four candidate methyl ketones:\n- $R = n$-butyl: $\\mathrm{CH_3CO-CH_2CH_2CH_2CH_3}$ (2-hexanone) gives $B = \\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2COOH}$ (pentanoic acid), achiral.\n- $R =$ isobutyl: $\\mathrm{CH_3CO-CH_2CH(CH_3)_2}$ (4-methylpentan-2-one, MIBK) gives $B = \\mathrm{(CH_3)_2CHCH_2COOH}$ (3-methylbutanoic acid), which is achiral because the substituted carbon in the isopropyl unit has two identical methyl substituents.\n- $R = tert$-butyl: $\\mathrm{CH_3CO-C(CH_3)_3}$ (3,3-dimethylbutan-2-one, pinacolone) gives $B = \\mathrm{(CH_3)_3CCOOH}$ (2,2-dimethylpropanoic acid), achiral.\n- $R = sec$-butyl attached via the secondary carbon: $\\mathrm{CH_3CO-CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3}$ (3-methylpentan-2-one) gives $B = \\mathrm{HOOC-CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3}$ (2-methylbutanoic acid), which is chiral because the $\\alpha$-carbon to the carboxyl group is bonded to four different substituents ($H$, $\\mathrm{CH_3}$, $\\mathrm{CH_2CH_3}$, and $\\mathrm{COOH}$).\n\nThus the requirement that B be chiral uniquely selects $R$ as sec-butyl attached via the secondary carbon, so Compound A must be $\\mathrm{CH_3CO-CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3}$, whose IUPAC name is 3-methylpentan-2-one.\n\nThe final observation is that reduction of A with $\\mathrm{NaBH_4}$ in methanol followed by aqueous workup gives a mixture of diastereomeric alcohols. Reduction of a ketone creates a new stereocenter at the former carbonyl carbon. If the ketone has no pre-existing stereocenter, $\\mathrm{NaBH_4}$ reduction gives a racemic pair of enantiomers. However, 3-methylpentan-2-one already contains a stereocenter at C-3 (the $\\mathrm{CH(CH_3)}$ carbon), so reduction generates two stereoisomeric alcohols that are diastereomeric with respect to the existing stereocenter. This matches the stated outcome and further confirms the structure.\n\nTherefore, the unique structure of Compound A consistent with all observations is 3-methylpentan-2-one.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{3-methylpentan-2-one}}$$", "id": "2210740"}, {"introduction": "The iodoform test can be elevated from a qualitative tool to a precise quantitative method.
