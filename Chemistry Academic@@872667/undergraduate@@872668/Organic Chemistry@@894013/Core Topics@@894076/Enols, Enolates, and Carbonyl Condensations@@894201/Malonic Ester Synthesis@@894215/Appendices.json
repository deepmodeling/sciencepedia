In a specific application of this synthesis, butanoic acid is prepared starting from diethyl malonate. The synthesis proceeds in two major stages. First, diethyl malonate is treated with sodium ethoxide in ethanol, followed by the addition of ethyl bromide.

Treatment with sodium ethoxide in ethanol deprotonates the doubly activated methylene between the two carbonyls to give the malonate enolate. Alkylation with ethyl bromide installs an ethyl group at that carbon, producing the monoalkylated malonate $\\text{EtO}_2\\text{C-CH(Et)-CO}_2\\text{Et}$, which bears a single hydrogen on the substituted central carbon.\n\nIn the second stage, heating with $\\text{D}_3\\text{O}^+$ hydrolyzes both ester groups to the diacid $\\text{HO}_2\\text{C-CH(Et)-CO}_2\\text{H}$ and then induces decarboxylation to give butanoic acid. Under these strongly acidic, deuterated conditions, two independent deuterium incorporations occur:\n\n1. Exchange at the carboxylic acid oxygen: The O-H of the carboxyl group undergoes rapid acid–base exchange with $\\text{D}_3\\text{O}^+$, establishing the equilibrium $\\text{RCO}_2\\text{H} + \\text{D}_3\\text{O}^+ \\rightleftharpoons \\text{RCO}_2\\text{D} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + \\text{D}_2\\text{O}$. The product acid therefore exists predominantly as $\\text{RCO}_2\\text{D}$ in the final mixture.\n\n2. Exchange at the alpha carbon (C-2): \n   - Before decarboxylation, the C-H bond on the central carbon of $\\text{HO}_2\\text{C-CH(Et)-CO}_2\\text{H}$ is highly acidified by the two adjacent carboxyl groups. In acidic $\\text{D}_3\\text{O}^+$, enolization followed by deuteration exchanges this hydrogen for deuterium, converting it to a C-D bond.\n   - During decarboxylation, a six-membered transition state forms the enol of the product acid, which then tautomerizes in the deuterated medium. The enol-to-keto tautomerization incorporates a deuterium atom at the alpha carbon from the deuterated solvent. Consequently, the alpha carbon of the final butanoic acid (C-2) becomes deuterated.\n\nThe beta carbon (C-3) lacks an enolization pathway under these conditions and does not undergo H/D exchange. Therefore, in the final reaction mixture, deuterium is present on the carboxyl oxygen and on the alpha carbon (C-2), but not on the beta carbon (C-3).\n\nThus, the most accurate choice is that deuterium atoms are found on both the oxygen of the carboxylic acid group and on the alpha-carbon (C-2).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2182948"}, {"introduction": "The elegance of the malonic ester synthesis extends beyond making simple, linear carboxylic acids.

This nucleophile then reacts with 1-bromo-3-chloropropane. Since bromide is a better leaving group than chloride, an $S_N2$ reaction occurs selectively at the carbon bonded to bromine. This forms Intermediate I, which is diethyl 2-(3-chloropropyl)malonate.\n\nIn the second step, Intermediate I is treated with a second equivalent of sodium ethoxide. This deprotonates the α-carbon of the malonate moiety, generating a tethered carbanion.\n\nThis carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular $S_N2$ reaction. The nucleophilic α-carbon attacks the terminal carbon of the chloropropyl chain, displacing the chloride ion and forming a three-membered ring. This is a 3-exo-tet cyclization. Although 3-exo-tet ring closures are often kinetically disfavored by Baldwin's rules, they are feasible in this case due to the high reactivity of the malonate carbanion and the formation of a stable cyclopropane ring.
