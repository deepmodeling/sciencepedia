Two separate experiments are conducted.\n\n*   **Experiment 1:** Neopentyl bromide is treated with a strong, non-nucleophilic base, potassium tert-butoxide ($\\text{KOC}(\\text{CH}_3)_3$), in a tert-butanol solvent, a set of conditions that strongly favors the E2 elimination pathway.\n*   **Experiment 2:** Neopentyl bromide is gently heated in ethanol ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$), a polar protic solvent that can act as a weak base, a set of conditions that typically favors the E1 elimination pathway.\n\nIn both experiments, the student observes that the neopentyl bromide is almost entirely unreactive, with no significant amount of alkene product being formed over a reasonable timescale.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best and most complete explanation for the observed unreactivity of neopentyl bromide in *both* Experiment 1 and Experiment 2?\n\nA. The E2 reaction is mechanistically impossible due to the absence of beta-hydrogens, and the E1 reaction is prohibitively slow because it would require the formation of a highly unstable primary carbocation in its rate-determining step.\n\nB. The E2 reaction is slow due to severe steric hindrance around the beta-hydrogens, and the E1 reaction is disfavored because primary halides cannot form carbocations under any circumstances.\n\nC. Both E1 and E2 reactions are prevented because the C-Br bond is unusually strong due to an inductive effect from the tert-butyl group, making the bromide ion a poor leaving group.\n\nD. The E2 reaction fails because the bulky tert-butyl group prevents the substrate from adopting the required anti-periplanar conformation for elimination, and the E1 reaction fails because ethanol is not a sufficiently polar solvent to support carbocation formation.\n\nE. The substrate preferentially undergoes a rapid $\\text{S}_\\text{N}2$ reaction under both sets of conditions, consuming the reactant before any elimination can occur.", "solution": "Identify the structural requirements for concerted bimolecular elimination. In an E2 process, a base must abstract a hydrogen from a beta carbon while the leaving group departs from the alpha carbon in a single concerted transition state; this necessarily requires the presence of at least one beta hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbon bearing the leaving group. In neopentyl bromide, the alpha carbon is the methylene bearing bromine, and the only adjacent (beta) carbon is the quaternary carbon of the tert-butyl framework. A quaternary carbon has zero hydrogens. Therefore, there are no beta hydrogens available, and E2 elimination is mechanistically impossible rather than merely slow or conformationally hindered. This rules out explanations that invoke steric slowing or anti-periplanar issues as the controlling factor for E2.\n\nEvaluate the unimolecular elimination pathway. An E1 mechanism proceeds via rate-determining ionization to form a carbocation at the alpha carbon, followed by base-induced deprotonation to give the alkene. For neopentyl bromide, initial ionization would yield a primary neopentyl carbocation lacking resonance stabilization. Such a primary carbocation is highly unstable and forms at an impractically slow rate under the stated conditions. Although hydride shift rearrangement to a tertiary tert-butyl carbocation would be favorable once a cation exists, that rearrangement cannot precede the rate-determining ionization; hence it does not alleviate the high barrier for the first step. Ethanol is a polar protic solvent that supports E1 for tertiary (and resonance-stabilized) systems, but it is not sufficient to overcome the severe instability of a simple primary carbocation like neopentyl. Thus, the E1 pathway is prohibitively slow in Experiment 2.\n\nExclude alternative explanations. The C–Br bond in alkyl bromides is not unusually strong in this context, and bromide is a good leaving group, so invoking an inductive strengthening of the bond is not a valid general explanation. The anti-periplanar requirement is irrelevant when no beta hydrogen exists at all. Finally, rapid bimolecular substitution does not account for the observations: neopentyl substrates are famously unreactive toward $\\text{S}_\\text{N}2$ due to extreme steric congestion at and beyond the beta position, and the chosen conditions either use a non-nucleophilic base (potassium tert-butoxide) or a weak nucleophile (ethanol), so neither experiment would be expected to funnel the substrate into fast substitution that would mask elimination.\n\nSynthesize the conclusions. The lack of any beta hydrogen makes E2 impossible, and the need to form an unstabilized primary carbocation makes E1 prohibitively slow. This matches option A precisely and completely, whereas the other options are incomplete or contain incorrect assertions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2178456"}, {"introduction": "Once we establish that an elimination reaction can occur, the next question is often 'where?'.
