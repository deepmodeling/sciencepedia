{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Let's begin by exploring the foundational stereochemical outcome of the $S_N1$ reaction. This first practice examines what happens when an optically pure starting material, possessing a single stereocenter at the reaction site, undergoes solvolysis. By tracing the fate of this stereocenter through the mechanism, we can directly visualize the consequence of forming a planar, achiral carbocation intermediate, which is the cornerstone of $S_N1$ stereochemistry [@problem_id:2202482].", "problem": "An optically pure sample of (R)-3-iodo-3-methylhexane is subjected to hydrolysis in water.

They are constitutional isomers.\nB. They are diastereomers.\nC. They are enantiomers.\nD. They are identical (the same compound).\nE. They are meso compounds.", "solution": "The substrate is optically pure (R)-3-iodo-3-methylhexane, which has a stereogenic center at C3. Under hydrolysis in water proceeding exclusively via an $S_N1$ mechanism, the reaction occurs in two key steps:\n\n1) Ionization: The C–I bond heterolytically cleaves to form a tertiary carbocation at C3 and iodide. The tertiary carbocation is stabilized by the three alkyl substituents (methyl, ethyl, propyl), and crucially, this carbocation has a trigonal planar geometry at C3, rendering the reactive center achiral during this intermediate stage.\n\n2) Nucleophilic attack: Water acts as a nucleophile and attacks the planar carbocation from either face with comparable probability. Attack from one face leads to inversion relative to the original configuration and attack from the opposite face leads to retention relative to the original orientation. After deprotonation, both pathways yield 3-methylhexan-3-ol with opposite configurations at C3 (one R and one S).\n\nSince the product has a single stereogenic center and the two major products differ only by inversion at that single center, they are non-superimposable mirror images. Therefore, the two major isomeric alcohol products are enantiomers.\n\nThey are not constitutional isomers because the connectivity is unchanged (only the configuration at the stereocenter differs). They are not diastereomers, which would require at least two stereocenters or stereochemical difference not as mirror images. They are not identical because they have opposite configurations. They cannot be meso because a meso compound requires at least two stereocenters and an internal plane of symmetry, which is not the case here.\n\nThus, the correct stereochemical relationship is enantiomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2202482"}, {"introduction": "Moving from prediction to practical application, this next exercise challenges you to think like a synthetic chemist. A successful synthesis often depends on controlling stereochemical outcomes, and this problem requires you to select a starting material that will specifically yield a racemic product via the $S_N1$ pathway. This task sharpens your problem-solving skills by forcing you to consider not only the desired reaction but also potential competing pathways and structural pitfalls, such as rearrangements or the presence of multiple stereocenters [@problem_id:2202448].", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is tasked with selecting a suitable starting material for a synthesis that requires the formation of a racemic mixture of ethers. The experimental plan involves a solvolysis reaction of a pure enantiomer of a chiral alkyl halide, having the molecular formula $C_6H_{13}Cl$, in methanol. The reaction is expected to proceed via a unimolecular nucleophilic substitution ($S_N1$) mechanism.\n\nWhich of the following compounds, when used as a pure enantiomer, would successfully yield a racemic mixture of ether products under these conditions?\n\nA. (S)-3-chlorohexane\nB. (R)-1-chloro-2-methylpentane\nC. 2-chloro-2-methylpentane\nD. (2S, 3R)-3-chloro-2-methylpentane\nE. (R)-2-chloro-3,3-dimethylbutane", "solution": "We aim to choose a chiral alkyl chloride of formula $C_6H_{13}Cl$ that, upon solvolysis in methanol via an $S_N1$ mechanism, forms a planar carbocation at the stereocenter and is subsequently attacked from both faces by methanol to give a racemic mixture of ether products. The key requirements for a racemic mixture under $S_N1$ solvolysis are:\n- The leaving group must depart from a stereogenic carbon to generate a carbocation at that center.\n- The carbocation must be sufficiently stable to form without undergoing rearrangement to a different center.\n- There must not be additional stereocenters that would convert the frontside and backside attack products into diastereomers rather than enantiomers.\n- The substrate must be capable of existing as a pure enantiomer (i.e., be chiral).\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. (S)-3-chlorohexane\n- Structure: $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH(Cl)CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$. The chlorine-bearing carbon is secondary and stereogenic.\n- $S_N1$ ionization gives a secondary carbocation at C3, which is trigonal planar. Attack by $\\text{CH}_3\\text{OH}$ occurs from both faces, producing equal amounts of R and S 3-methoxyhexane, i.e., a racemic mixture.\n- Rearrangement analysis: Adjacent carbons (C2 and C4) are secondary; 1,2-hydride or alkyl shifts would not generate a more stable carbocation (no tertiary center available), so rearrangement is disfavored.\n- Conclusion: Meets all criteria; gives racemization.\n\nB. (R)-1-chloro-2-methylpentane\n- The chloride is on a primary carbon (C1). Primary carbocations are too unstable for $S_N1$ under standard solvolysis; the reaction, if any, would proceed via $S_N2$, yielding inversion rather than racemization.\n- Conclusion: Does not give a racemic mixture via $S_N1$.\n\nC. 2-chloro-2-methylpentane\n- The carbon bearing Cl has two identical methyl groups; the molecule is achiral. Therefore a “pure enantiomer” is not definable.\n- Conclusion: Not a valid chiral starting material; cannot satisfy the requirement.\n\nD. (2S, 3R)-3-chloro-2-methylpentane\n- Contains two stereocenters. Ionization at C3 gives a secondary carbocation adjacent to C2. A 1,2-hydride shift from C2 to C3 would generate a more stable tertiary carbocation at C2, favoring rearrangement before capture.\n- Even without rearrangement, methanol attack at C3 would invert or retain the configuration at that center while leaving C2 unchanged, giving a pair of diastereomers, not an enantiomeric (racemic) pair.\n- Conclusion: Does not give a racemic mixture of ether products.\n\nE. (R)-2-chloro-3,3-dimethylbutane\n- The chloride-bearing carbon (C2) is secondary and stereogenic, adjacent to a quaternary carbon at C3. Ionization gives a secondary carbocation at C2, which is highly prone to a 1,2-methyl shift from C3 to C2. This shift produces a more stable tertiary carbocation at C3.\n- Capture by methanol at C3 then gives an ether with two identical methyl groups at the substituted carbon, rendering that center achiral; the product is not a racemic mixture.\n- Conclusion: Rearrangement prevents racemization at the original stereocenter; no racemic mixture results.\n\nTherefore, only option A satisfies all conditions for formation of a racemic mixture of ethers via $S_N1$ solvolysis in methanol without rearrangement or diastereomer complications.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2202448"}, {"introduction": "Real-world molecules, particularly those in biological systems, often contain multiple stereocenters. This final practice introduces this layer of complexity, investigating an $S_N1$ reaction where the starting material has a second, \"spectator\" stereocenter that is not directly involved in the reaction.

In an $S_N1$ reaction in water, the mechanism proceeds by:\n1) Heterolytic cleavage of the C2–Br bond to form a tertiary carbocation at C2. This carbocation is planar and $sp^2$-hybridized, allowing nucleophilic attack from either face.\n2) Water attacks the planar carbocation at C2 from both faces with comparable probability, yielding after deprotonation two alcohols that differ only in the configuration at C2. The stereochemistry at C4 remains unchanged because C4 is not involved in the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the two major alcohol products are the pair (2R,4S)-2-hydroxy-2,4-dimethylhexane and (2S,4S)-2-hydroxy-2,4-dimethylhexane. These two products have the same connectivity and the same configuration at C4 but opposite configuration at C2. By definition, compounds that differ at one (but not all) stereocenters are diastereomers, not enantiomers. They are not identical, not constitutional isomers, and cannot be a meso compound because the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and the stereocenters are not symmetrically equivalent.\n\nHence, the stereochemical relationship between the two major alcohol products is that they are diastereomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2202457"}]}
