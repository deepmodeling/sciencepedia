It is highly polar (dielectric constant $\\epsilon \\approx 33$) and can form hydrogen bonds. It will strongly stabilize the polar transition state. Its ability to act as a hydrogen-bond donor is particularly effective at stabilizing the developing negative charge on the departing iodide ion.\n\n-   **Acetone ($(CH_3)_2CO$)** is a polar aprotic solvent. It is polar ($\\epsilon \\approx 21$) but cannot donate hydrogen bonds. It will stabilize the polar transition state through dipole-dipole interactions, but generally less effectively than a polar protic solvent of similar or greater polarity, which can stabilize both developing positive and negative poles.\n\n**Comparing the three solvents:**\nThe reaction rate increases with solvent polarity.\n-   Hexane is nonpolar, so it will be the slowest: $k_{\\text{hexane}}$ is the smallest.\n-   Both methanol and acetone are polar and will accelerate the reaction relative to hexane.\n-   Comparing methanol and acetone: Methanol is more polar than acetone (higher dielectric constant) and has the additional ability to stabilize the transition state via hydrogen bonding to the developing iodide anion. This provides a lower energy pathway compared to acetone.

Any factor that stabilizes the transition state of the rate-determining step more than it stabilizes the reactant for that step will lower the activation energy and increase the reaction rate.\n\nLet's analyze the rate-determining step (RDS) of the reaction. The problem states the RDS is the formation of a carbocation from a protonated alcohol.\nLet R-OH be the starting diol.\nStep 1 (fast equilibrium): $\\text{R-OH} + \\text{H}^{+} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{R-OH}_{2}^{+}$ (protonated alcohol, an oxonium ion)\nStep 2 (slow, RDS): $\\text{R-OH}_{2}^{+} \\rightarrow \\text{R}^{+} \\text{(carbocation)} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$\n\nThe transition state for the RDS, denoted $[TS]^{\\ddagger}$, is a structure where the C-O bond is partially broken and a positive charge is developing on the carbon atom ($[\\text{R}^{\\delta+} \\cdots \\text{OH}_2^{\\delta+}]^{\\ddagger}$). This transition state is highly polar and carries significant charge, resembling the carbocation product of this step.\n\nNow, let's compare the two solvents:\n- **Condition 1: Diethyl ether ($(\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2)_2\\text{O}$)** is a relatively nonpolar, aprotic solvent. It has a low dielectric constant. While the oxygen atom's lone pairs can provide some solvation for cations, its ability to stabilize charged species is weak.\n- **Condition 2: Aqueous solution ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$)** means the primary solvent is water. Water is a highly polar, protic solvent with a high dielectric constant. It is exceptionally effective at solvating charged species through ion-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding.\n\nLet's compare the stabilization of the species in the RDS in both solvents.\nThe reactant for the RDS is the protonated diol, $\\text{R-OH}_{2}^{+}$, which is already a charged species. The transition state $[TS]^{\\ddagger}$ and the carbocation intermediate $\\text{R}^{+}$ are also charged and highly polar. The highly polar and protic water in Condition 2 is much better at stabilizing the charge-separated transition state and the resulting carbocation intermediate compared to the much less polar diethyl ether in Condition 1. Because the transition state is more stabilized by the polar solvent than the initial protonated alcohol (which has a more localized charge on the oxygen), the overall activation energy for the RDS is significantly lowered in water.\n\nSince the reaction rate constant ($k$) is related to activation energy by the Arrhenius equation, $k = A \\exp(-E_a / RT)$, a lower activation energy ($E_a$) leads to an exponentially higher reaction rate.\n\nTherefore, changing the solvent from the less polar diethyl ether to the highly polar water will dramatically increase the reaction rate.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\nA. The reaction rate will be significantly faster in Condition 2. This is consistent with our analysis.\nB. The reaction rate will be significantly slower in Condition 2. This is incorrect. Polar solvents stabilize carbocation formation.\nC. The reaction rate will be approximately the same in both conditions. This is incorrect; solvent effects are profound for reactions involving charged intermediates.\nD. The product composition will be different, but the rates will be unaffected.

The cyclic transition state is intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded, with the proton in flight and limited charge separation; its polarity is not markedly greater than that of the already polar starting acid, and the specific solvation that stabilizes the free acid (strong hydrogen bonding to the acid OH and carbonyl groups) is partially disrupted in forming the preorganized, intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded cyclic arrangement. Consequently, ethanol stabilizes the reactant free energy $G_{\\text{R},\\text{ethanol}}$ significantly more than it stabilizes the transition state free energy $G_{\\text{TS},\\text{ethanol}}$, whereas in hexane both are much less solvated:\n$$\n\\left[G_{\\text{TS},\\text{ethanol}} - G_{\\text{R},\\text{ethanol}}\\right] > \\left[G_{\\text{TS},\\text{hexane}} - G_{\\text{R},\\text{hexane}}\\right],\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{ethanol}} > \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{hexane}} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad k_{\\text{ethanol}} < k_{\\text{hexane}}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the rate decreases in ethanol relative to hexane because the polar protic solvent stabilizes the polar starting material more than the less polar, cyclic transition state. This directly supports option A.\n\nBy contrast, option B incorrectly assumes significant charge separation in the transition state that would be preferentially stabilized by ethanol; the concerted, intramolecular, hydrogen-bonded cyclic transition state is not strongly ionic. Option C neglects well-established solvent effects on relative stabilization of ground and transition states even for intramolecular processes. Option D posits acid catalysis by ethanol; however, the canonical thermal decarboxylation proceeds without external acid catalysis, and protonation of the ketone oxygen would invoke a different, more ionic pathway not implied under the stated conditions.
