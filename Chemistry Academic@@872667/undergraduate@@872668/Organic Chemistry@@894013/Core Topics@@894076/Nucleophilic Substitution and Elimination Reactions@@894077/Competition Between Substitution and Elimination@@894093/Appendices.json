The key mechanistic competition is between $\\mathrm{S_N2}$ and $\\mathrm{E_2}$, with respective rate expressions\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\mathrm{S_N2}}=k_{\\mathrm{S_N2}}[\\text{RX}][\\text{Nu}^{-}],\\quad \\text{Rate}_{\\mathrm{E_2}}=k_{\\mathrm{E_2}}[\\text{RX}][\\text{Base}].\n$$\nUnder identical concentrations, selectivity is controlled by the relative magnitudes of $k_{\\mathrm{S_N2}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{E_2}}$, which depend on steric and solvent effects and on the nature of the reagent.\n\nFirst, the reagent and solvent: $\\text{t-BuO}^-$ is a strong, bulky base and a sterically hindered nucleophile. In a protic solvent such as $\\text{t-BuOH}$, nucleophilicity is further attenuated by solvation, whereas basicity is less diminished relative to nucleophilicity. Consequently, $k_{\\mathrm{S_N2}}$ is suppressed more than $k_{\\mathrm{E_2}}$, biasing the competition toward $\\mathrm{E_2}$.\n\nSecond, substrate structure effects on each pathway:\n- For $\\mathrm{S_N2}$, steric hindrance at the $\\alpha$ and even $\\beta$ positions strongly lowers $k_{\\mathrm{S_N2}}$, and bulky nucleophiles suffer especially.\n- For $\\mathrm{E_2}$, a strong base drives deprotonation of a $\\beta$-hydrogen anti to the leaving group; bulky bases favor elimination and often lead to Hofmann orientation when multiple $\\beta$ sites exist. Formation of a more substituted alkene can also thermodynamically reinforce $\\mathrm{E_2}$ when accessible.\n\nApply these to each reaction.\n\nReaction A (1-bromobutane, a primary unbranched halide, with $\\text{t-BuO}^-/\\text{t-BuOH}$):\n- $\\mathrm{S_N2}$ is feasible for a primary substrate but is substantially slowed with $\\text{t-BuO}^-$ in a protic solvent due to steric hindrance and solvation. The $\\mathrm{S_N2}$ product would be tert-butyl butyl ether.\n- $\\mathrm{E_2}$ is favored by the strong bulky base. There is a single $\\beta$-carbon (C-2) bearing $\\beta$-hydrogens, so elimination leads specifically to 1-butene (the less substituted, Hofmann alkene). Because $\\text{t-BuO}^-$ is bulky and $\\text{t-BuOH}$ is protic, $\\mathrm{E_2}$ tends to predominate, though some $\\mathrm{S_N2}$ remains competitive for this unhindered primary substrate.\n\nReaction B (1-bromo-2-methylpropane, i.e., isobutyl bromide, a primary but $\\beta$-branched halide, with $\\text{t-BuO}^-/\\text{t-BuOH}$):\n- $\\beta$-branching markedly depresses $k_{\\mathrm{S_N2}}$ even for a primary center (the neopentyl-like effect), and this is exacerbated by the bulky, solvated $\\text{t-BuO}^-$, making $\\mathrm{S_N2}$ especially disfavored.\n- $\\mathrm{E_2}$ removes the single $\\beta$-hydrogen on the adjacent methine, forming 2-methylpropene, a more substituted and more stable alkene. With a strong bulky base and a protic solvent, $\\mathrm{E_2}$ is strongly dominant here.\n\nTherefore, both A and B predominantly undergo $\\mathrm{E_2}$ under these conditions, but the elimination-to-substitution ratio is significantly larger for Reaction B than for Reaction A due to the much greater suppression of $\\mathrm{S_N2}$ in B and the favorable formation of a highly substituted alkene.\n\nThis pattern corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2160888"}, {"introduction": "When a tertiary alkyl halide is placed in a polar protic solvent, it often ionizes to form a stable carbocation, initiating a competition between unimolecular substitution ($S_N1$) and elimination ($E_1$) pathways.

In a polar protic solvent mixture (methanol and water) under warming, tertiary alkyl halides undergo unimolecular ionization to a tertiary carbocation (SN1/E1 conditions). The leaving group departs to form the tertiary carbocation at C3. This carbocation is triethylcarbinyl in nature (the cationic center is bonded to three ethyl groups), so it is highly stabilized and there is no driving force for rearrangement (any 1,2-shift would give a secondary carbocation, which is less stable).\n\nNucleophilic substitution (SN1): Both water and methanol act as nucleophiles.\n- Capture by water followed by deprotonation gives the tertiary alcohol 3-ethylpentan-3-ol (I).\n- Capture by methanol followed by deprotonation gives the tertiary methyl ether 3-methoxy-3-ethylpentane (II).\n\nElimination (E1): From the tertiary carbocation, deprotonation at any beta carbon gives an alkene with the double bond between the cationic center and that beta carbon. The three beta positions are the methylene carbons of the three ethyl groups bonded to the cationic center; by symmetry, elimination at any of these positions yields the same constitutional alkene. The unique alkene thus formed is 3-ethylpent-2-ene (III). No distinct isomer with the double bond at another position is formed, because all beta eliminations are equivalent by symmetry, and there is no rearrangement.\n\nGeometric isomerism: The alkene has two identical ethyl substituents on the C3 carbon of the double bond, so E/Z stereoisomerism is not defined. Therefore, (E)-3-ethylpent-2-ene (VI) is not a distinct product.\n\nOther listed options ruled out:\n- 2-ethylpent-1-ene (IV) would require rearrangement to a less stable secondary carbocation or a subsequent isomerization; neither is favored under these conditions.\n- 3-ethylpentan-2-ol (V) would require nucleophilic attack on a rearranged secondary carbocation; again, no rearrangement is favored from the more stable tertiary carbocation.\n\nTherefore, the complete set of neutral organic products is I (tertiary alcohol), II (tertiary methyl ether), and III (the single alkene).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2160882"}, {"introduction": "The predictive rules for substitution and elimination are ultimately governed by strict stereoelectronic requirements that are not always met. This problem [@problem_id:2160906] explores the fascinating case of 1-bromoadamantane, a bridgehead halide that is famously unreactive under conditions that would typically promote $S_N2$ or $E_2$ reactions. By analyzing its rigid, cage-like structure, you will uncover the fundamental geometric constraints—the impossibility of backside attack for $S_N2$ and the lack of an anti-periplanar C-H bond for $E_2$—that render these pathways inaccessible.", "problem": "Adamantane is a rigid, cage-like hydrocarbon with the formula $C_{10}H_{16}$, composed of three fused cyclohexane rings in their chair conformations. Its structure is highly symmetric, possessing four equivalent \"bridgehead\" positions. When one of these bridgehead hydrogens is replaced with a bromine atom, 1-bromoadamantane is formed.\n\nExperimentally, 1-bromoadamantane is found to be exceptionally inert when treated with a strong, non-bulky base and nucleophile, such as sodium ethoxide in ethanol. These conditions typically promote Bimolecular Nucleophilic Substitution (SN2) and Bimolecular Elimination (E2) reactions in other alkyl halides.\n\nConsider the following statements regarding the reactivity of 1-bromoadamantane:\n\nI. The rigid cage-like structure prevents the backside approach of a nucleophile to the carbon bearing the bromine, a necessary step for the SN2 mechanism.\nII. The tertiary bridgehead carbocation that would be an intermediate is exceptionally unstable due to an inability to achieve planar geometry.\nIII. The rigid geometry of the adamantane skeleton prevents any adjacent C-H bond from aligning in the anti-periplanar arrangement with the C-Br bond, a stereoelectronic requirement for the E2 mechanism.\nIV. The C-Br bond at the bridgehead position is significantly stronger than in a typical acyclic tertiary alkyl halide due to hyperconjugation with the cage, making it more difficult to break.\n\nWhich of the choices below provides the correct combination of statements that explain the observed lack of reactivity for **both** the SN2 and E2 pathways?\n\nA. I and II\n\nB. II and III\n\nC. I and III\n\nD. I and IV\n\nE. II and IV", "solution": "We analyze the two concerted pathways in question, SN2 and E2, by applying their stereoelectronic requirements to the geometry of 1-bromoadamantane at a bridgehead carbon.\n\nFor SN2, the mechanism requires backside attack by the nucleophile into the antibonding orbital $\\sigma^{*}_{\\text{C-Br}}$ that is colinear and opposite the C–Br bond. This demands an unhindered trajectory for approach opposite the leaving group and a transition state with inversion at the reacting carbon. In 1-bromoadamantane, the reacting carbon is a bridgehead within a rigid, caged, polycyclic framework. The spatial arrangement of the cage blocks access to the backside of the C–Br bond; equivalently, the required approach to $\\sigma^{*}_{\\text{C-Br}}$ is sterically and topologically inaccessible. Therefore, statement I correctly explains the lack of SN2 reactivity.\n\nFor E2, the mechanism is concerted and requires a base to abstract a $\\beta$-hydrogen whose C–H bond is aligned anti-periplanar to the C–Br bond, i.e., a dihedral angle of 180° between the C–H and C–Br bonds so that the developing $\\pi$ bond forms as the base removes H and the leaving group departs. In 1-bromoadamantane with a bridgehead leaving group, the rigid geometry of the cage prevents any adjacent C–H from achieving an anti-periplanar arrangement with the C–Br bond. Moreover, the elimination would place a double bond at the bridgehead, which is disallowed in such a small, rigid polycyclic system by the same geometric constraint underlying Bredt’s rule (the required parallel p orbitals cannot be achieved at a bridgehead here). Thus, statement III correctly explains the lack of E2 reactivity.\n\nStatement II invokes instability of a tertiary bridgehead carbocation due to nonplanarity. While bridgehead carbocations are destabilized by geometric constraints (and 1-adamantyl cations require superacid conditions with nonclassical stabilization), this point pertains to SN1/E1 pathways and does not explain the observed lack of reactivity under SN2/E2 conditions, which proceed without carbocation intermediates. Hence II is not relevant to the suppression of SN2 and E2 here.\n\nStatement IV claims a significantly stronger C–Br bond due to hyperconjugation with the cage. This is not the accepted reason for the inertness; bond-strength enhancement of this nature is not the dominant effect for 1-bromoadamantane, and tertiary alkyl halide C–Br bonds are not generally strengthened by hyperconjugation. The primary origins of the inertness are the stereoelectronic and topological constraints described in I and III.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination that explains the lack of reactivity for both SN2 and E2 pathways is I and III.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2160906"}]}
