Before delving into reactions or properties, it's crucial to be able to visualize and distinguish the various ways atoms can be connected. This first practice focuses on constitutional isomerism, challenging you to systematically determine all unique ether structures that share the same molecular formula, $C_4H_{10}O$ [@problem_id:2205264]. Mastering this skill builds a strong foundation for recognizing the diversity of molecular architecture possible from a simple set of atoms.", "problem": "A chemical analysis of a solvent mixture reveals the presence of several organic compounds, all of which share the molecular formula $C_{4}H_{10}O$. Further spectroscopic investigation confirms that all compounds in the mixture belong to the ether functional group family. Determine the total number of distinct constitutional isomers possible for an ether with this molecular formula.\n\nA. 2\nB. 3\nC. 4\nD. 5\nE. 6", "solution": "We are told all compounds are ethers with molecular formula $C_{4}H_{10}O$. An ether has the connectivity $R-O-R^{\\prime}$, where $R$ and $R^{\\prime}$ are alkyl groups. The degree of unsaturation is zero because for $n=4$, a saturated acyclic structure with one oxygen has $H=2n+2=10$, matching $C_{4}H_{10}O$. Therefore, cyclic ethers (which would have $C_{n}H_{2n}O$) are excluded, and only acyclic ethers need to be considered.\n\nLet $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ be the numbers of carbons in $R$ and $R^{\\prime}$, respectively. For an ether, we require\n$$\nn_{1}+n_{2}=4,\\quad n_{1}\\ge 1,\\quad n_{2}\\ge 1.\n$$\nThe possible carbon partitions are $(n_{1},n_{2})=(1,3)$ and $(2,2)$.\n\nFor $(2,2)$: both substituents are ethyl groups. There is only one constitutional isomer, diethyl ether, with connectivity $CH_{3}CH_{2}-O-CH_{2}CH_{3}$.\n\nFor $(1,3)$: one substituent is methyl and the other is propyl. The propyl group has two constitutional isomers: $n$-propyl and isopropyl. Thus there are two distinct ethers:\n- Methyl $n$-propyl ether: $CH_{3}-O-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{3}$.\n- Methyl isopropyl ether: $CH_{3}-O-CH(CH_{3})_{2}$.\n\nNo other partitions exist, and alcohols (which would correspond to $(4,0)$) are excluded by the requirement that the functional group is an ether. There are no additional constitutional isomers within these categories because ethyl has no isomers for two carbons, and the two propyl connectivities have already been counted. Therefore, the total number of distinct ether constitutional isomers with formula $C_{4}H_{10}O$ is\n$$\n1+2=3.\n$$\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2205264"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple connectivity, the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms—stereochemistry—plays a vital role in a molecule's identity and function. This exercise shifts our focus to epoxides, a special class of strained cyclic ethers, to explore these spatial concepts [@problem_id:2205243]. You will analyze the structure of *cis*-2,3-diethyloxirane to determine its chirality, providing a perfect opportunity to apply your knowledge of symmetry and uncover the nature of meso compounds—molecules that contain stereocenters but are achiral overall.", "problem": "Analyze the stereochemistry of the molecule named *cis*-2,3-diethyloxirane.

The molecule is achiral because it does not possess any stereocenters.\nC. The molecule is an achiral meso compound.\nD. The molecule is achiral due to rapid conformational inversion at room temperature.\nE. The molecule is chiral, but it is a diastereomer of *trans*-2,3-diethyloxirane.", "solution": "Identify the stereocenters: In 2,3-diethyloxirane, the ring carbons $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ each bear four different substituents: $H$, $C_{2}H_{5}$, $O$, and the other ring carbon. Therefore, both $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ are stereogenic centers, so the molecule has stereocenters.\n\nAnalyze the relative configuration: The descriptor cis means the two ethyl groups on $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ lie on the same face of the three-membered ring. With identical substituents on adjacent stereocenters in a three-membered ring, the cis arrangement often introduces an internal symmetry element.\n\nTest for an internal mirror plane: In cis-2,3-diethyloxirane, there is a mirror plane that passes through the oxygen atom and bisects the $C_{2}-C_{3}$ bond, reflecting $C_{2}$ onto $C_{3}$. Because the substituents at $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ are identical ($C_{2}H_{5}$ and $H$) and both ethyl groups are on the same face, this reflection maps each substituent set onto the other. Consequently, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nConclude chirality: The presence of this internal mirror plane makes the cis isomer achiral despite having two stereocenters. This is the definition of a meso compound: it contains stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal symmetry element.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A is incorrect: cis-2,3-diethyloxirane is not a pair of enantiomers; it is a single achiral meso compound.\n- B is incorrect: there are stereocenters at $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$.\n- C is correct: it is an achiral meso compound.\n- D is incorrect: achirality does not arise from conformational inversion in this rigid three-membered ring.\n- E is incorrect: although cis and trans are diastereomers, the cis isomer is not chiral.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that cis-2,3-diethyloxirane is an achiral meso compound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2205243"}, {"introduction": "This final practice serves as a capstone, integrating the concepts of constitutional and positional isomerism within a more complex molecular framework. You are tasked with identifying aromatic ethers that fit a specific molecular formula and a set of structural constraints [@problem_id:2205220].

A benzene ring accounts for $4$ units of unsaturation, so no additional rings or multiple bonds are present outside the aromatic ring.\n\nA disubstituted benzene has ring formula $C_{6}H_{4}$; adding the specified substituents gives $C_{6}H_{4} + CH_{3} + C_{2}H_{5}O = C_{9}H_{12}O$, consistent with the target formula. The oxygen resides entirely in the $C_{2}H_{5}O$ substituent. Because the molecule must contain an ether ($\\mathrm{R{-}O{-}R'}$) and there is only one oxygen, the $C_{2}H_{5}O$ substituent must be arranged so that an ether is present. There are exactly two non-cyclic constitutional possibilities for a $C_{2}H_{5}O$ substituent that contain an ether:\n1) Ethoxy attached via oxygen to the ring: $-$O$-$CH_{2}CH_{3}$ (aryl ethyl ether).\n2) Methoxymethyl attached via carbon to the ring: $-$CH_{2}OCH_{3}$ (the ether lies within the substituent).\n\nThe alternative $C_{2}H_{5}O$ connectivities that are alcohols, namely $-$CH_{2}CH_{2}OH and $-$CH(OH)CH_{3}$, do not provide an ether and are excluded.\n\nFor each valid $C_{2}H_{5}O$ connectivity, the benzene is disubstituted with two different groups (methyl and the $C_{2}H_{5}O$ substituent), yielding three distinct ring substitution patterns: ortho, meta, and para.
