For epoxides, the regiochemistry of nucleophilic ring opening depends on conditions:\n- Under basic or neutral conditions with an anionic nucleophile, the mechanism is $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$-like, and attack occurs at the less substituted (less hindered) epoxide carbon.\n- Under acidic conditions, attack occurs at the more substituted carbon due to carbocation-like character.\n\nHere, the reaction uses excess $NaN_3$ in $CH_3OH$, so the dominant nucleophile is the azide anion, $N_3^-$. Therefore, $N_3^-$ attacks the less substituted epoxide carbon (the methylene carbon of the three-membered ring), opening the epoxide via backside attack and generating an alkoxide at the spiro carbon:\n$$\\text{1-oxaspiro[2.5]octane} + N_3^- \\to \\text{alkoxide at the spiro carbon with a } -\\text{CH}_2\\text{N}_3 \\text{ substituent.}$$\n\nIn the methanol solvent, the resulting alkoxide is protonated to give the alcohol at the spiro carbon:\n$$\\text{alkoxide} + \\text{CH}_3\\text{OH} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{alcohol} + \\text{CH}_3\\text{O}^-.$$\n\nCombining these steps:\n$$\\text{1-oxaspiro[2.5]octane} \\xrightarrow[N_3^-]{CH_3OH} \\text{1-(azidomethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol}.$$\n\nThis corresponds to option C. Alternative products such as those arising from methanol attack (option D) would be minor under conditions of excess $N_3^-$, and rearranged products (e.g., ring-expansion to a cycloheptanone, option B) are characteristic of acid-catalyzed pathways, not the basic $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ opening operative here. Direct azide attack at the more substituted spiro carbon to give a hydroxymethyl substituent (option A) is also disfavored under these basic conditions due to sterics and the $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ mechanism’s preference for the less substituted site.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2195866"}, {"introduction": "Having explored steric control, we now turn to the opposite scenario: acid-catalyzed ring-opening. This problem demonstrates how protonating the epoxide oxygen changes the mechanism, favoring nucleophilic attack at the more substituted carbon atom that can better stabilize a developing positive charge.

No reaction occurs under these conditions.", "solution": "Under strongly acidic conditions, epoxide ring opening proceeds via protonation of the epoxide oxygen to form a protonated epoxide (an epoxonium ion). Protonation by HBr generates a positively charged, activated epoxide and liberates bromide as the nucleophile.\n\nIn acid-catalyzed epoxide openings, nucleophilic attack occurs at the more substituted carbon of the protonated epoxide because the transition state has substantial carbocation character at that position; thus, the more substituted (and more stabilized) site is favored. For 2-methyl-2-phenyloxirane, the epoxide carbon bearing both a phenyl and a methyl group is the more substituted and is additionally benzylic; this site best stabilizes positive charge through resonance with the aromatic ring and hyperconjugation.\n\nTherefore, $Br^-$ attacks the benzylic, more substituted epoxide carbon from the backside (anti to the leaving oxygen), opening the ring. The oxygen remains attached to the less substituted carbon and, after deprotonation by solvent water, becomes an alcohol. The resulting product is a bromohydrin with bromine at the benzylic, tertiary center and hydroxyl at the primary carbon: $\\text{HO-CH}_2\\text{-C(Br)(CH}_3\\text{)(Ph)}$.

The reaction under study is the methanolysis of *trans*-1-phenyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)oxirane, which is treated with a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$) in methanol ($CH_3OH$) as the solvent.\n\nThe reaction mechanism involves the initial protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by the opening of the ring to form a transition state with significant carbocation character on one of the two original epoxide carbons. The methanol nucleophile then attacks this electrophilic center. The regioselectivity of the reaction is governed by the relative stability of the two possible transition states.\n\nIn this particular substrate, two powerful electronic stabilization effects are in competition:\n1.  **Benzylic stabilization**: A positive charge on the carbon atom adjacent to the phenyl group is stabilized by resonance.\n2.  **The $\\beta$-silicon effect**: A positive charge on a carbon atom that is beta (two bonds away) to a silicon atom is strongly stabilized by hyperconjugation with the carbon-silicon $\\sigma$-bond.\n\nThe two possible regioisomeric products of the reaction are given below:\n- **Compound I**: 2-methoxy-1-phenyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)ethan-1-ol\n- **Compound II**: 1-methoxy-1-phenyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)ethan-2-ol\n\nBased on a comparison of the relative strengths of the benzylic and $\\beta$-silicon electronic effects, which statement below most accurately predicts the outcome of the reaction?\n\nA.

Nucleophilic attack by methanol then occurs with ring opening through a transition state in which significant positive charge develops at one of the two epoxide carbons. The regioselectivity is determined by the relative stabilization of the developing carbocationic character in the two competing transition states. In general, the rate toward a given product is proportional to $\\exp(-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}/RT)$, so the pathway with the lower activation free energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ will dominate.\n\nLabel the benzylic epoxide carbon as $C_{1}$ (adjacent to the phenyl group) and the silicon-bearing epoxide carbon as $C_{2}$ (bearing the trimethylsilyl group). Two limiting transition states are possible:\n- TS$_{\\text{benzylic}}$: ring opening with developing positive charge at $C_{1}$, stabilized by benzylic resonance. Nucleophilic attack at $C_{1}$ gives Compound II (1-methoxy-1-phenyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)ethan-2-ol).\n- TS$_{\\beta\\text{-Si}}$: ring opening with developing positive charge at $C_{2}$, stabilized by the $\\beta$-silicon effect (hyperconjugative donation from the $\\,\\sigma\\,(C\\!-\\!Si)$ bond into the developing $p$ orbital).

Empirically and mechanistically, this effect can surpass classical benzylic resonance stabilization in lowering $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ for cationic processes.
