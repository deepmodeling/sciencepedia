The steps are:\n- Protonation of the hydroxyl group to form a good leaving group (water).\n- Departure of water gives a secondary carbocation at C2.\n- A 1,2-hydride shift occurs: a hydrogen atom from the adjacent C3 moves to C2, transferring the positive charge to C3 and forming a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n- Bromide then attacks the tertiary carbocation to give the rearranged tertiary alkyl bromide, 2-bromo-2-methylbutane.\n\nUnder treatment with $PBr_3$, the mechanism is a substitution via $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$:\n- The alcohol is converted to a phosphorus ester, creating a good leaving group without forming a free carbocation.\n- Bromide performs a backside attack at the carbon that originally bore the hydroxyl group (C2), displacing the leaving group in a single step.\n- No carbocation is formed, so no rearrangement occurs.

The reaction conditions are phosphorus tribromide in the presence of pyridine. The relevant mechanistic principle is that alcohols treated with $PBr_3$ undergo conversion to alkyl bromides via an $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ displacement at the carbon bearing the leaving group, proceeding with backside attack and a single Walden inversion at that carbon. Formation of the phosphorus ester intermediate occurs at phosphorus and does not alter the configuration at carbon; the stereochemical change arises only in the subsequent $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ step at C2.\n\nStep-by-step:\n1. The alcohol oxygen of (2S, 3S)-3-methylpentan-2-ol attacks $PBr_3$ to form the corresponding dibromophosphite ester; pyridine acts as a base to neutralize acidic byproducts. This step does not change the configuration at C2 because no bond at the stereogenic carbon is broken or formed in a way that inverts its configuration.\n2. A bromide ion generated in situ performs an $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ backside attack on C2, displacing the phosphorus-containing leaving group. This $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ reaction leads to a single inversion at C2 (Walden inversion).\n3. The stereochemistry at C3 is not involved in bond-making or bond-breaking steps and therefore remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore:\n- C2 inverts from S to R.\n- C3 remains S.\n\nThe product is 2-bromo-3-methylpentane with configuration (2R, 3S), which corresponds to choice B.\n\nNo carbocation intermediate is formed under these conditions, so racemization at C2 does not occur, and there are no rearrangements.

A reliable way to enforce overall retention in nucleophilic substitutions at a secondary stereocenter is to design a sequence that accomplishes two consecutive bimolecular substitutions at carbon, because each $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ step inverts the configuration, and two inversions give net retention.\n\nStep-by-step stereochemical logic:\n1) Use phosphorus tribromide ($PBr_3$) to convert the secondary alcohol to the corresponding bromide. Mechanistic principle: alcohol reacts with $PBr_3$ to generate a good leaving group and bromide displaces via an $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ process at the stereogenic carbon. Consequence: the configuration at the carbon inverts once. Starting from (R)-octan-2-ol, this step gives (S)-2-bromooctane.\n2) Displace bromide with chloride using a chloride salt under $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ conditions. In acetone, chloride acts as a nucleophile and attacks the secondary bromide in an $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ reaction, inverting the configuration a second time. Consequence: inversion of (S)-2-bromooctane to (R)-2-chlorooctane. Thus, the two inversions lead to overall retention relative to the starting alcohol.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A. 1. $PBr_3$; 2. NaCl in acetone: Step 1 is $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ inversion to the bromide; Step 2 is $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ displacement of Br by Cl, inverting again; net retention. This matches the required stereochemical outcome via a two-step sequence.\n- B. 1. TsCl in Py; 2. LiCl: Tosylation occurs at oxygen and does not change the stereochemistry at carbon (retention at carbon). Subsequent $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ displacement by Cl${}^{-}$ inverts once, giving overall inversion, not retention.\n- C. $SOCl_2$ in diethyl ether: A single-step option; although $SOCl_2$ in nonbasic solvents can proceed via an $S_{\\mathrm{N}}i$ pathway that may give retention in some systems, the problem stipulates that single-step options are unsuitable or do not reliably give the desired stereoisomer, hence a two-step sequence is required.\n- D. $SOCl_2$ in Py: Typically proceeds with $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ at carbon and gives inversion, not retention; also single-step, contrary to the given requirement.\n- E. 1. NaH; 2. $CHCl_3$: This would form an alkoxide and then react with chloroform, which does not effect substitution to chloride at the stereocenter; not a valid route to the target.\n\nTherefore, the only provided two-step sequence that enforces two $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ inversions and achieves overall retention at the stereocenter is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2163341"}]}
