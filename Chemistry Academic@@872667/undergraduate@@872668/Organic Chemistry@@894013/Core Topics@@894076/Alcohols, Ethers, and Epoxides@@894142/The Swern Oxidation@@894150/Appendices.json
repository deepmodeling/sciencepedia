This first practice problem provides a foundational example of its utility, challenging you to predict the outcome when a molecule containing both a primary alcohol and an ester is subjected to Swern conditions. Successfully solving this demonstrates an understanding of the reaction's ability to selectively oxidize alcohols to the aldehyde stage without affecting other common functional groups [@problem_id:2213692].", "problem": "An organic chemist is performing a selective oxidation. The starting material for the synthesis is methyl 5-hydroxypentanoate. The compound is subjected to a two-step reaction sequence.

Pentanedial", "solution": "The reagent combination dimethyl sulfoxide with oxalyl chloride at low temperature followed by addition of a hindered amine base (triethylamine) constitutes a Swern oxidation. The governing principles are:\n- Activation of DMSO by oxalyl chloride generates an electrophilic sulfonium species and releases gaseous byproducts (carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide). The activated DMSO then reacts with an alcohol to form an alkoxysulfonium intermediate.\n- Upon treatment with a base such as triethylamine, the alkoxysulfonium intermediate undergoes deprotonation and syn-elimination to furnish the corresponding carbonyl compound, giving aldehydes from primary alcohols and ketones from secondary alcohols. No overoxidation to carboxylic acids occurs under anhydrous Swern conditions, and esters are inert to these conditions.\n\nThe substrate, methyl 5-hydroxypentanoate, is an omega-hydroxy ester with the structure $\\text{HO}-(\\text{CH}_2)_4-\\text{CO}_2\\text{Me}$. It contains:\n- A primary alcohol at carbon 5 (relative to the ester carbonyl carbon as carbon 1).\n- A methyl ester at carbon 1, which remains unaffected under Swern oxidation.\n\nApplying Swern oxidation selectively converts the primary alcohol at carbon 5 into an aldehyde, while leaving the methyl ester intact. The resulting product is thus the ester bearing an aldehyde at carbon 5. In IUPAC terms, this is named methyl 5-oxopentanoate, where the “oxo” at position 5 denotes the newly formed aldehyde carbonyl on the terminal carbon of the chain when the ester remains the principal functional group.\n\nExcluding alternatives:\n- 5-Methoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid would require both methoxylation at carbon 5 and hydrolysis/oxidation to a carboxylic acid; these do not occur under Swern conditions.\n- Methyl 5-hydroxypentanoate is the starting material and would not be the product after complete reaction.\n- Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (a delta-lactone) would require a free carboxylic acid and intramolecular esterification, which is not generated under these conditions since the ester is unchanged and aldehydes do not spontaneously lactonize with esters.\n- Pentanedial would require transforming the ester into an aldehyde at carbon 1 in addition to oxidizing the alcohol at carbon 5; Swern oxidation does not reduce or modify esters.\n\nTherefore, the major product is methyl 5-oxopentanoate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2213692"}, {"introduction": "A true grasp of a reaction mechanism goes beyond knowing the reagents and products; it requires a quantitative understanding of their roles.
