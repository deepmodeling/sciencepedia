This skill depends on understanding how substituents influence the stability of a molecule's conjugate base through electronic effects like induction and resonance.

The stability of the corresponding conjugate base, the phenoxide ion, dictates the acidity of the parent phenol. A more stable conjugate base corresponds to a stronger acid and, consequently, a lower $pK_a$ value.

A lower $pK_{a}$ corresponds to a larger $K_{a}$ and thus greater acidity. Greater stability of the conjugate base $\\text{ArO}^{-}$ increases $K_{a}$.\n\nFor nitrophenols, the $-NO_{2}$ group exerts both a strong $-I$ (inductive, electron-withdrawing) and a $-M$ (mesomeric, resonance-withdrawing) effect. The phenoxide conjugate base is stabilized when its negative charge can be delocalized into the ring and further onto the nitro group via resonance. This resonance interaction occurs when $-NO_{2}$ is ortho or para to the $O^{-}$, but not when it is meta. Therefore:\n- Ortho- and para-nitrophenoxide ions are stabilized by both $-I$ and $-M$ effects.\n- Meta-nitrophenoxide is stabilized only by the $-I$ effect (no effective resonance delocalization to the nitro group at the meta position).\n\nHence, meta-nitrophenol is the least acidic (highest $pK_{a}$), while ortho and para are more acidic (lower $pK_{a}$) than meta.\n\nBetween ortho and para, both permit resonance stabilization, but additional structural effects differentiate them in aqueous solution:\n- Ortho-nitrophenol in its neutral form is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the phenolic $O\\!-\\!H$ and a nitro oxygen. This preferentially stabilizes the acid relative to its conjugate base, decreasing $K_{a}$ (raising $pK_{a}$) compared to the para isomer.\n- The ortho-nitrophenoxide anion is less effectively solvated due to steric hindrance and can experience through-space electrostatic repulsion between the phenoxide $O^{-}$ and nearby nitro oxygens, which destabilizes the anion relative to the para isomer.\n\nConsequently, although both ortho and para allow resonance delocalization, para-nitrophenol is more acidic than ortho-nitrophenol in water, giving:\n$$\\text{acidity (strength)}:\\ \\text{para} > \\text{ortho} > \\text{meta} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\text{increasing } pK_{a}:\\ \\text{para}  \\text{ortho}  \\text{meta}.$$\nMatching to the options, this corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2152717"}]}
