This final exercise challenges you to explain why certain ethers, specifically those with aryl groups, are unreactive towards acid-catalyzed cleavage. By examining the electronic and structural properties of aromatic ethers, you will uncover the fundamental reasons behind their stability and better define the scope of this important synthetic tool [@problem_id:2151851].", "problem": "Diphenyl ether, with the chemical structure $(C_6H_5)_2O$, is an aromatic ether that demonstrates remarkable chemical stability. When subjected to heating with concentrated hydrobromic acid ($HBr$), a set of conditions that typically leads to the rapid cleavage of most dialkyl or alkyl-aryl ethers, diphenyl ether remains unreactive. The overall reaction for a generic ether cleavage is $$R-O-R' + 2 HBr \\rightarrow R-Br + R'-Br + H_2O$$. However, for diphenyl ether, this reaction does not proceed.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental chemical explanation for the inertness of diphenyl ether towards acid-catalyzed cleavage by $HBr$?\n\nA. The two bulky phenyl groups create significant steric hindrance that prevents the initial protonation of the ether oxygen by the acid.\nB. The resonance delocalization of the oxygen's lone pairs into both aromatic rings significantly reduces the basicity of the oxygen atom, preventing the initial protonation step required for cleavage.\nC. The cleavage reaction would have to proceed through a phenyl carbocation intermediate, which is highly stabilized by resonance and therefore has a high activation energy for its formation.\nD. The carbon-oxygen bonds involve $sp^2$-hybridized carbons from the phenyl rings. These bonds are stronger than $C(sp^3)-O$ bonds, and nucleophilic attack by bromide on an $sp^2$-hybridized carbon center is mechanistically prohibitive.", "solution": "The acid cleavage of ethers by hydrogen halides proceeds via two fundamental steps: (i) protonation of the ether oxygen to form an oxonium ion, and (ii) carbon–oxygen bond cleavage by halide via either an $S_N2$ pathway at an $sp^3$ carbon or an $S_N1$ pathway via a carbocation at a suitably stabilized $sp^3$ center. In alkyl–aryl ethers (for example, anisole), protonation is followed by $S_N2$ attack of halide at the alkyl $sp^3$ carbon, giving aryl alcohol and alkyl halide. In contrast, for aryl–aryl ethers such as diphenyl ether, both carbons bonded to oxygen are $sp^2$ carbons of aromatic rings.\n\nConsider the possible post-protonation pathways for diphenyl ether:\n1. $S_N2$ attack by $Br^{-}$ at an $sp^2$ aryl carbon is mechanistically prohibited because backside displacement at a planar $sp^2$ center is not feasible; furthermore, the transition state would disrupt aromaticity. Thus, $S_N2$ cleavage at aryl carbon does not occur.\n2. $S_N1$ cleavage would require formation of a phenyl cation. A phenyl cation is exceedingly unstable and is not resonance-stabilized in a way that would facilitate its formation; therefore, this pathway is not viable.\n3. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (addition–elimination) at the aryl carbon would require strong ring deactivation (for example, nitro groups ortho or para to the leaving group) to stabilize the Meisenheimer intermediate; such activating substituents are absent in diphenyl ether, so this pathway is also inaccessible.\n\nAdditionally, the $C-O$ bonds in diphenyl ether are between oxygen and $sp^2$ carbons, and these bonds possess partial double-bond character due to resonance, making them stronger than $C(sp^3)-O$ bonds. This further raises the barrier for cleavage. While the oxygen lone pairs can delocalize into the aromatic rings, reducing basicity to some extent, strong acids can still protonate aryl ethers; the fundamental bottleneck is the impossibility of the requisite $C-O$ bond cleavage at an $sp^2$ aryl center.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is not the fundamental reason; protonation is not primarily prevented by sterics.\n- Option B overemphasizes reduced basicity; even if protonation is less favorable, it is not the rate-limiting impediment compared to the forbidden $C-O$ cleavage at $sp^2$ carbon.\n- Option C is incorrect both mechanistically (phenyl cations are not stabilized) and in its stated rationale.\n- Option D correctly identifies the key mechanistic prohibition: the need to cleave $C(sp^2)-O$ bonds and perform nucleophilic attack at an $sp^2$ aryl carbon, which is not viable under these conditions.\n\nHence, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is given by D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2151851"}]}
