Cyclohexanol", "solution": "Goal: select a secondary alcohol whose acid-catalyzed dehydration proceeds primarily by an E1 mechanism to give trans-3-hexene.\n\nPrinciples used:\n- Under strongly acidic conditions, a secondary alcohol undergoes E1 elimination: (i) protonation of the hydroxyl group to form a good leaving group, (ii) unimolecular loss of water to form a carbocation at the carbon initially bearing the hydroxyl group, and (iii) deprotonation at a beta position to form an alkene.\n- E1 eliminations are generally under thermodynamic control, favoring the more substituted and more stable alkene (Zaitsev’s rule). For disubstituted internal alkenes, the trans isomer is usually favored over the cis due to lower steric strain.\n\nAnalysis of options:\n- A. 3-Pentanol: Dehydration yields pentenes (primarily 2-pentene), not a hexene. Rejected due to carbon count mismatch.\n- B. 2-Hexanol: Dehydration forms a secondary carbocation at C2. Elimination can then yield 1-hexene (monosubstituted) and 2-hexene (disubstituted). By Zaitsev's rule, 2-hexene would be the major product. This alcohol cannot form 3-hexene.\n- C. 3-Hexanol: Protonation and loss of water form a secondary carbocation at C3. Deprotonation from the adjacent C2 yields 2-hexene, and deprotonation from C4 yields 3-hexene. Both are disubstituted alkenes, so a mixture is expected. However, of the options provided, this is the most direct precursor for synthesizing 3-hexene.\n- D. 4-Heptanol: Dehydration gives heptenes, not hexenes. Rejected due to carbon count mismatch.\n- E. Cyclohexanol: Dehydration yields cyclohexene, not a linear hexene. Rejected due to ring structure.\n\nConclusion: The most logical starting material is 3-hexanol. Although a mixture of 2-hexene and 3-hexene is expected, it is the only precursor listed that can form 3-hexene, making it the most logical choice for the synthesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2166226"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of reaction mechanisms allows us to identify and correct common misconceptions.

The mechanism is entirely correct. The formation of a primary carbocation is a common feature of elimination reactions involving primary alcohols.\n\nB. Step 1 is incorrect. The strong acid should deprotonate a carbon atom adjacent to the hydroxyl group to initiate an E1cb-type mechanism.\n\nC. Step 2 contains a significant flaw. The formation of a primary carbocation is a very high-energy, disfavored process. The reaction is more likely to proceed via a single, concerted E2 step, avoiding a carbocation intermediate altogether.\n\nD. Step 2 is incorrect because the primary carbocation would be attacked by the bisulfate ion (HSO₄⁻) in an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ reaction to form butyl sulfate, preventing alkene formation.\n\nE. The proposed mechanism is plausible but incomplete. The primary carbocation described in Step 2 would not lead to 1-butene directly; it would first undergo a 1,2-hydride shift to form a more stable secondary carbocation.", "solution": "The overall dehydration of a primary alcohol under strongly acidic, high-temperature conditions proceeds by first activating the hydroxyl group as a better leaving group via protonation, followed by C–H bond cleavage and C–O bond cleavage in a single concerted step that avoids formation of a primary carbocation.\n\nFirst, acid–base protonation of the alcohol oxygen converts the poor leaving group OH into the good leaving group $H_2O$:\n$$\n\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}_{2}^{+} + \\text{HSO}_{4}^{-}.\n$$\nThis step is chemically reasonable because protonation increases the leaving ability of the group attached to carbon by forming neutral water.\n\nThe student’s Step 2 proposes unimolecular loss of water to form a primary carbocation, followed by deprotonation to give 1-butene. This contains the key flaw: formation of a primary carbocation is highly unfavorable due to carbocation stability trends (tertiary > secondary >> primary). Under strongly acidic conditions, primary alcohols dehydrate by an E2 mechanism after protonation of the hydroxyl group, in which C–H bond cleavage at the $\\beta$-carbon and C–O bond cleavage occur synchronously, thereby avoiding a discrete primary carbocation intermediate. A representative concerted step is:\n$$\n\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}_{2}^{+} + \\text{HSO}_{4}^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH=CH}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O},\n$$\nor, using water as the base,\n$$\n\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}_{2}^{+} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH=CH}_{2} + \\text{H}_{3}\\text{O}^{+}.\n$$\nThese pathways are concerted eliminations (E2) and avoid a high-energy primary carbocation.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because invoking a primary carbocation as a standard feature is not accurate; primary carbocations are strongly disfavored.\n- Option B is incorrect because in strongly acidic media the first step is protonation of the hydroxyl oxygen, not deprotonation of a $\\beta$-carbon to initiate E1cb; E1cb requires a poor leaving group and basic conditions, not strong acid.\n- Option C is correct: the flaw is the proposed formation of a primary carbocation; the reaction proceeds instead by a single concerted E2 step after protonation.\n- Option D is incorrect because nucleophilic capture of a carbocation is not an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ process, and the premise of a primary carbocation is itself inappropriate under these conditions.\n- Option E is incorrect because it presupposes a primary carbocation that would rearrange; the operative pathway for a primary alcohol under these conditions avoids carbocation formation altogether.\n\nThus, the most accurate critique is that Step 2 is flawed and the reaction proceeds via concerted E2 elimination after protonation, avoiding a primary carbocation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2166242"}, {"introduction": "The reactivity of carbocation intermediates is a cornerstone of the E1 mechanism, and one of their most fascinating behaviors is the ability to rearrange.

Zaitsev’s rule predicts that the major alkene is the most substituted one available from the accessible carbocation(s).\n\nThe target alkene, 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene, is the fully substituted internal double bond with the structure in which both alkene carbons each bear two methyl groups. This product is most directly formed from a tertiary carbocation centered at the carbon that will become part of the double bond.\n\nConsider each candidate alcohol:\n\nA. 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanol. Protonation of the hydroxyl followed by loss of water generates a secondary carbocation at C2. The adjacent carbon C3 is quaternary (no hydrogens), so direct elimination to give the internal double bond C2=C3 is not possible without rearrangement. A 1,2-methyl shift from C3 to C2 converts the C2 secondary carbocation into a more stable tertiary carbocation at C3. From this tertiary carbocation, deprotonation at C2 gives the internal, tetrasubstituted alkene 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene as the Zaitsev product. Therefore A can give the required major product.\n\nB. 2,3-dimethyl-1-butanol. This is a primary alcohol. Under acid-catalyzed dehydration, primary substrates do not form a stable carbocation and typically dehydrate by an E2 pathway, giving a terminal alkene from C1–C2 elimination. Although one could invoke hydride/methyl shifts to reach a tertiary carbocation, the standard outcome under dehydration conditions is not the symmetric, fully substituted internal alkene as the major product. Thus B does not reliably furnish 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene as the major product.\n\nC. 2,3-dimethyl-2-butanol. Protonation and loss of water give a tertiary carbocation directly at C2. Elimination to either side leads to the same internal double bond C2=C3, furnishing 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene as the Zaitsev product. This alcohol cleanly gives the target alkene as the major (indeed, essentially unique) product.\n\nD. 4-methyl-2-pentanol. Dehydration gives alkenes in the methylpentene series (e.g., 4-methyl-2-pentene) rather than the symmetric 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene. No rearrangement pathway leads to the symmetric tetrasubstituted butene as the major product. Thus D is not suitable.\n\nE. 2-methyl-2-pentanol. Loss of water gives a tertiary carbocation at C2 that eliminates to 2-methyl-2-pentene as the Zaitsev product. There is no driving force for rearrangement to the different carbon framework of 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene. Thus E is not suitable.\n\nTherefore, the two alcohols that give 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene as the major product under acid-catalyzed dehydration are A and C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2166192"}]}
