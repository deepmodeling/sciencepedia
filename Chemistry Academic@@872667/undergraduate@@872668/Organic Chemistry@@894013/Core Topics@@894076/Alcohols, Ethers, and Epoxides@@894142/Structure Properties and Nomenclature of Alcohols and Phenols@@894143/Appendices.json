{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding organic chemistry begins with mastering the language of molecular structure. This involves not only drawing molecules but also classifying them based on their functional groups and three-dimensional arrangement. This first exercise challenges you to integrate these core concepts by identifying a molecule from its constitutional isomers based on two key descriptors: its functional group class (a primary alcohol) and its stereochemical nature (chirality). Successfully solving this problem demonstrates your ability to translate a specific set of structural properties into a unique chemical identity [@problem_id:2205887].", "problem": "Consider the constitutional isomers of alcohols with the molecular formula $C_5H_{12}O$. One of these isomers satisfies two specific criteria: it is classified as a primary alcohol, and it is a chiral molecule. Identify the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for this specific isomer from the options provided below.\n\nA. Pentan-1-ol\nB. Pentan-2-ol\nC. 2-Methylbutan-1-ol\nD. 3-Methylbutan-1-ol\nE. 2,2-Dimethylpropan-1-ol", "solution": "We seek an isomer of $C_{5}H_{12}O$ that is both a primary alcohol and chiral. A primary alcohol has its hydroxyl-bearing carbon attached to only one other carbon (i.e., a $\\mathrm{CH_{2}OH}$ group in aliphatic cases). A chiral molecule must contain at least one tetrahedral carbon attached to four different substituents (a stereogenic center).\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Pentan-1-ol: Structure $\\mathrm{HO{-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{3}}$. Primary, but the $\\mathrm{CH_{2}OH}$ carbon bears two hydrogens and is not stereogenic; there is no other stereocenter. Achiral. Not suitable.\n\nB. Pentan-2-ol: Structure $\\mathrm{CH_{3}{-}CH(OH){-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{3}}$. The $\\mathrm{C{-}OH}$ carbon is bonded to $\\mathrm{OH}$, $\\mathrm{H}$, $\\mathrm{CH_{3}}$, and $\\mathrm{C_{3}H_{7}}$ (four different groups), so it is a stereogenic center and the molecule is chiral. However, it is secondary (the $\\mathrm{C{-}OH}$ carbon is attached to two carbons). Fails the primary requirement.\n\nC. 2-Methylbutan-1-ol: Structure $\\mathrm{HO{-}CH_{2}{-}CH(CH_{3}){-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{3}}$. It is a primary alcohol. The $\\mathrm{C2}$ carbon is bonded to $\\mathrm{H}$, $\\mathrm{CH_{3}}$, $\\mathrm{CH_{2}CH_{3}}$, and $\\mathrm{CH_{2}OH}$, which are four different substituents, so $\\mathrm{C2}$ is a stereogenic center and the molecule is chiral. Satisfies both criteria.\n\nD. 3-Methylbutan-1-ol: Structure $\\mathrm{HO{-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{2}{-}CH(CH_{3}){-}CH_{3}}$. Primary, but the substituted carbon is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not stereogenic; the molecule is achiral. Not suitable.\n\nE. 2,2-Dimethylpropan-1-ol: Structure $\\mathrm{HO{-}CH_{2}{-}C(CH_{3})_{3}}$. Primary, but there is no stereocenter because the $\\mathrm{CH_{2}OH}$ carbon is not stereogenic and the quaternary carbon has three identical methyl substituents. Achiral. Not suitable.\n\nTherefore, the only isomer that is both primary and chiral is option C, 2-methylbutan-1-ol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2205887"}, {"introduction": "Once we can define a molecule's structure, we can begin to predict its chemical properties. A molecule's acidity, for instance, is not a random value but a direct consequence of its electronic architecture. This practice problem explores this fundamental principle by examining the cresol isomers, where you will analyze how the position of a simple methyl group on a phenol ring influences acidity through a combination of inductive and resonance effects [@problem_id:2205905]. This exercise is key to understanding how substituents fine-tune the reactivity of aromatic systems.", "problem": "Cresol is the common name for methylphenol ($C_7H_8O$), an organic compound that is a widely used precursor or intermediate in the production of other chemicals, fragrances, and disinfectants. Cresol exists as three distinct constitutional isomers based on the relative positions of the methyl group (-CH$_3$) and the hydroxyl group (-OH) on the benzene ring. These isomers are designated as *ortho*-cresol, *meta*-cresol, and *para*-cresol.\n\nThe acidity of these phenolic compounds can be quantified by their acid dissociation constant ($K_a$) or, more conveniently, its negative logarithm ($pK_a$). A lower $pK_a$ value indicates a stronger acid. Your task is to determine the correct order of acidity for these three isomers.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly ranks the cresol isomers from most acidic to least acidic?\n\nA. *para*-cresol > *meta*-cresol > *ortho*-cresol\nB. *ortho*-cresol > *meta*-cresol > *para*-cresol\nC. *meta*-cresol > *para*-cresol > *ortho*-cresol\nD. *ortho*-cresol > *para*-cresol > *meta*-cresol\nE. *meta*-cresol > *ortho*-cresol > *para*-cresol", "solution": "Acidity is compared via the equilibrium\n$$\\text{ArOH} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{ArO}^{-} + \\text{H}_{3}\\text{O}^{+},$$\nwith acid strength quantified by\n$$K_{a}=\\frac{[\\text{ArO}^{-}][\\text{H}_{3}\\text{O}^{+}]}{[\\text{ArOH}]}, \\quad pK_{a}=-\\log_{10}(K_{a}).$$\nA lower $pK_{a}$ (larger $K_{a}$) indicates a more stable conjugate base and thus a stronger acid.\n\nFor cresols, the substituent is -CH$_3$, which donates electron density by a `$+$I` effect and by hyperconjugation. In the phenoxide conjugate base, the negative charge is delocalized onto the ring carbons at the ortho and para positions by resonance. Therefore:\n- At the meta position, -CH$_3$ has no resonance interaction with the charge-bearing positions; only the relatively weak inductive donation operates. This causes the least destabilization of the phenoxide, making the meta isomer the most acidic.\n- At the para position, -CH$_3$ can interact with the charge-bearing position through resonance/hyperconjugation, donating electron density into an already electron-rich site of the phenoxide and thereby destabilizing it more than at meta. This decreases acidity relative to meta.\n- At the ortho position, the same electron-donating interaction with a charge-bearing position operates, and in addition, steric inhibition of solvation of the ortho-phenoxide anion further destabilizes the conjugate base. Both effects reduce acidity the most among the three.\n\nThus the conjugate-base stabilities satisfy\n$$\\text{stability}(\\text{meta-phenoxide}) > \\text{stability}(\\text{para-phenoxide}) > \\text{stability}(\\text{ortho-phenoxide}),$$\nso that\n$$K_{a}(\\text{meta}) > K_{a}(\\text{para}) > K_{a}(\\text{ortho}), \\quad pK_{a}(\\text{meta}) < pK_{a}(\\text{para}) < pK_{a}(\\text{ortho}).$$\nTherefore, the acidity order (most acidic to least acidic) is meta-cresol > para-cresol > ortho-cresol, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2205905"}, {"introduction": "Real-world chemical samples are often mixtures, and a chemist's skill lies in predicting how these mixtures will behave under specific reaction conditions.

This collection of compounds includes both alcohols and ethers. The entire mixture is then treated with an excess of hot, concentrated hydrobromic acid (HBr). This chemical treatment is known to convert all alcohol functional groups into their corresponding alkyl bromides and to cleave all ether functional groups, also forming their corresponding alkyl bromides. Assuming all reactions proceed to completion without any skeletal rearrangements, how many distinct organic bromide-containing compounds are present in the final product mixture?", "solution": "We first enumerate all acyclic constitutional isomers with formula $C_{4}H_{10}O$. These are alcohols and ethers only (no carbonyls since those would be $C_{4}H_{8}O$).\n\nAlcohol isomers (on the butane and isobutane skeletons):\n- 1-butanol $\\to$ 1-bromobutane.\n- 2-butanol $\\to$ 2-bromobutane.\n- 2-methyl-1-propanol (isobutanol) $\\to$ 1-bromo-2-methylpropane (isobutyl bromide).\n- 2-methyl-2-propanol (tert-butanol) $\\to$ 2-bromo-2-methylpropane (tert-butyl bromide).\n\nUnder excess hot, concentrated HBr and no skeletal rearrangements, each alcohol $R\\!-\\!OH$ gives its corresponding alkyl bromide $R\\!-\\!Br$.

The acyclic possibilities are:\n- Diethyl ether ($2+2$).\n- Methyl n-propyl ether ($1+3$ with $n$-propyl).\n- Methyl isopropyl ether ($1+3$ with isopropyl).\n\nUnder excess hot, concentrated HBr, ethers cleave to give both alkyl bromides corresponding to the two alkyl groups (and water).

Thus there is no duplication between the two sets. Stereoisomers (e.g., 2-bromobutane enantiomers) are not counted separately since the problem concerns constitutional distinctness.\n\nTherefore, the final product mixture contains $4$ distinct bromides from the alcohols and $4$ distinct bromides from the ethers, for a total of $4+4=8$ distinct organic bromide-containing compounds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "2205940"}]}
