With four total carbons, there are two distinct carbon skeletons:\n  1. Straight-chain: $CH_3CH_2CH_2CHO$, which is named butanal.\n  2. Branched: $(CH_3)_2CHCHO$, which is named 2-methylpropanal.\nNo other distinct acyclic aldehyde skeleton exists with four carbons; any attempt to place a methyl elsewhere either reproduces one of these or violates the four-carbon count.\n\nEnumerate acyclic ketones with $C_4H_8O$:\n- A ketone requires the carbonyl to be internal. With four carbons total, the only partition of the carbon skeleton around the carbonyl is methyl plus ethyl, giving $CH_3COCH_2CH_3$, which is named butan-2-one. A name like “butan-3-one” is identical by symmetry to butan-2-one, and a name like “methylpropanone” is not the correct systematic IUPAC name for this structure.\n\nTherefore, all unique acyclic aldehydes and ketones with formula $C_4H_8O$ are: butanal, 2-methylpropanal, and butan-2-one.\n\nCompare with the options:\n- A omits 2-methylpropanal.\n- B lists exactly the three correct compounds with proper systematic IUPAC names.\n- C includes “2-butanal” style aldehyde naming, which is invalid for an aldehyde, and “methylpropanone,” which is not the IUPAC name.\n- D includes cyclobutanol, which is cyclic and not a carbonyl compound.\n- E uses common names (“Isobutanal”) and a non-locanted ketone name (“Butanone”), not fully systematic.\n\nThus, the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2203749"}, {"introduction": "The language of chemistry must be precise, and IUPAC nomenclature provides the universal grammar for naming compounds. However, even seasoned students can misapply the rules, particularly when selecting the principal carbon chain. This practice problem presents a common mistake in naming a ketone.

Pentan-3-one", "solution": "The invalid name \"4-methyl-2-butanone\" suggests a student made an error in identifying the parent chain. Let's deconstruct the most plausible error that would lead to this name.\n1.  **Identify the Parent and Functional Group:** The name uses \"butan-2-one\" as the base, which corresponds to the structure $CH_3-C(=O)-CH_2-CH_3$.\n2.  **Identify the Substituent:** The name adds a \"4-methyl\" group. If we number the butanone chain conventionally from the end closer to the ketone, we have $CH_3(4)-CH_2(3)-C(=O)(2)-CH_3(1)$. The student then likely tried to place a methyl group on carbon 4.\n3.  **Construct the Implied Structure:** Replacing a hydrogen on the 4th carbon with a methyl group results in extending the chain: $(CH_3)CH_2-CH_2-C(=O)-CH_3$. This structure is hexan-2-one, which is not an option. A more plausible error is that the student conceptually extended the chain without re-evaluating the parent chain. For example, taking butan-2-one ($CH_3-C(=O)-CH_2-CH_3$) and adding a methyl group to the terminal carbon (C4), effectively extending the chain by one carbon, gives $CH_3-C(=O)-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3$.\n4.  **Apply Correct IUPAC Rules:** The resulting structure, $CH_3-C(=O)-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3$, is a five-carbon chain. The parent alkane is pentane. The functional group is a ketone, so the suffix is \"-one\". The chain must be numbered to give the carbonyl the lowest locant, which is position 2. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **pentan-2-one**.\n\nThe student's mistake was failing to recognize that adding a \"substituent\" to the end of the parent chain created a new, longer parent chain.

The ${}^1\\text{H}$ NMR spectrum shows a sharp singlet at $\\delta=9.5$ ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehydic proton ($-CHO$). This immediately accounts for the one degree of unsaturation as a carbonyl double bond in an aldehyde rather than a ring.\n\nThe integration ratio of the signal at $9.5$ ppm to the signal at $1.05$ ppm is $1:9$. Thus there is one aldehydic proton and nine equivalent protons giving a very intense singlet at $\\delta=1.05$ ppm. Nine equivalent protons appearing as a singlet near $1.0$ ppm strongly indicates a tert-butyl group, $(\\mathrm{CH}_{3})_{3}\\mathrm{C}-$. In such a group, the three methyl groups are equivalent and, because the attached carbon is quaternary (no hydrogens), there is no vicinal coupling to split them, so they appear as a singlet.\n\nThe aldehydic proton appearing as a singlet further implies that the carbon alpha to the formyl group has no hydrogens (otherwise the formyl proton typically shows small coupling to alpha hydrogens, giving a doublet, triplet, etc.). This is exactly the case for a tert-butyl aldehyde, where the formyl group is attached to a quaternary carbon.\n\nPutting these observations together, the structure consistent with the data is $(\\mathrm{CH}_{3})_{3}\\mathrm{CCHO}$, which has the formula $\\mathrm{C}_{5}\\mathrm{H}_{10}\\mathrm{O}$ and the systematic IUPAC name $2,2$-dimethylpropanal.\n\nEliminating the other options:\n- Pentanal would show multiple aliphatic signals and the aldehyde proton would be split by two alpha hydrogens (typically a triplet), not a singlet.\n- 2-Methylbutanal and 3-Methylbutanal would each have several distinct aliphatic signals and the aldehyde proton would be split by at least one alpha hydrogen (doublet or more), not a singlet.\n- Ketones (Pentan-2-one, Pentan-3-one) have no aldehydic proton and would not show a signal at $\\delta\\approx 9.5$ ppm.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is $2,2$-dimethylpropanal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2203801"}]}
