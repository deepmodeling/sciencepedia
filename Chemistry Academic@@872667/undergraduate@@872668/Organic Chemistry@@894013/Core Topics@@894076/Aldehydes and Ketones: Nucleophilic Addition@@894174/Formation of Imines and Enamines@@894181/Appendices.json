Propyl cyclobutanecarboxylate", "solution": "- Reaction type and driving force:\n  The reaction of a ketone (cyclobutanone) with a primary amine (propan-1-amine) under acid catalysis forms an imine (a Schiff base). The catalytic acid (p-toluenesulfonic acid) protonates the carbonyl to enhance electrophilicity, and the Dean–Stark apparatus continuously removes water, shifting the equilibrium toward imine formation by Le Chatelier’s principle.\n\n- Mechanistic steps (qualitative, standard imine formation from a ketone and a primary amine):\n  1) Protonation of the ketone carbonyl oxygen by the acid catalyst increases the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon.\n  2) Nucleophilic attack by the primary amine nitrogen on the carbonyl carbon forms a tetrahedral carbinolamine intermediate.\n  3) Proton transfers within the intermediate activate the hydroxyl group as a leaving group, and loss of water gives an iminium ion.\n  4) Deprotonation at nitrogen yields the neutral imine (a ketimine).\n\n- Product identity:\n  Because a primary amine is used, the major product is an imine, not an enamine (which would require a secondary amine). No reducing agent is present, so the carbonyl is not reduced to an amine. No conditions for amide or ester formation are present. The imine formed from cyclobutanone and propan-1-amine corresponds to the structure R_{cyclobutanone}C=NR' where R' is propyl. The IUPAC name for this ketimine is N-cyclobutylidenepropan-1-amine.\n\n- Evaluation of options:\n  A. N-Propylcyclobutanamine: requires reduction (reductive amination), not present here.\n  B. 1-(Propylamino)cyclobut-1-ene: an enamine product; secondary amines give enamines, not primary amines.\n  C. N-Cyclobutylidenepropan-1-amine: correct imine (ketimine) from cyclobutanone and propan-1-amine.\n  D. N-Cyclobutylpropanamide: an amide, not formed under these conditions.\n  E.

This practice explores the principle of chemoselectivity by using a starting material that contains both an aldehyde and a ketone. Your task is to determine which carbonyl group will preferentially react with a limited amount of a primary amine, a decision that relies on the inherent differences in electrophilicity and steric hindrance between aldehydes and ketones [@problem_id:2171627].", "problem": "A chemist is investigating selective functional group transformations on a bifunctional molecule.

The substrate 4-oxopentanal is a bifunctional 1,4-dicarbonyl compound bearing an aldehyde at C1 and a methyl ketone at C4. Under acid-catalyzed conditions, primary amines condense with carbonyl compounds to form imines (Schiff bases) via the standard sequence: reversible carbonyl protonation, nucleophilic addition of the amine to form a carbinolamine, and acid-catalyzed dehydration to the imine. This general transformation can be summarized for an aldehyde as\n$$\nRCHO + H_{2}N\\text{Pr} \\xrightarrow[\\text{cat.}]{\\text{acid}} RCH=N\\text{Pr} + H_{2}O.\n$$\n\nEstablish chemoselectivity. Aldehydes are more electrophilic and less sterically hindered than ketones. Under catalytic acid, both carbonyls are activated, but the aldehyde remains more reactive toward nucleophilic addition by a primary amine than the ketone. Therefore, when exactly one equivalent of amine is present, the aldehyde reacts preferentially and consumes the amine to form the corresponding imine, leaving the ketone unreacted.\n\nApply stoichiometry. Because only one equivalent of propylamine is used, formation of a diimine is precluded. Primary amines do not give enamines with carbonyls (that outcome requires secondary amines), so enamine-type products are not expected. Intramolecular condensations such as Paal–Knorr-type cyclizations are not favored here under the stated conditions with a mixed keto–aldehyde and exactly one equivalent of amine; the dominant, fastest process is the formation of the aldehyde-derived imine.\n\nTranslate the structure into the correct IUPAC name. The product is the imine formed at C1 (the aldehyde carbon) with the ketone at C4 retained. The correct IUPAC name for this is N-Propyl-4-oxopentan-1-imine.\n\nExclude the alternatives:\n- A implies imine formation at the ketone with the aldehyde intact, which is disfavored relative to aldehyde imine formation.\n- C requires two equivalents of amine to form a diimine, which contradicts the stated stoichiometry.\n- D describes an enamine-type product at C1, which does not arise from a primary amine.\n- E proposes a cyclic hemiaminal/tetrahydropyridine derivative, which is not the major product under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2171627"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand a reaction, chemists often look beyond the starting materials and final products to investigate the mechanism. This advanced exercise uses isotopic labeling to probe the fate of an enamine during hydrolysis in deuterated water ($D_2O$). Predicting the location of deuterium atoms in the final ketone product will deepen your understanding of the hydrolysis mechanism and its intimate connection to the fundamental concept of keto-enol tautomerism [@problem_id:2171600].", "problem": "An organic chemist is investigating isotopic labeling by hydrolyzing an enamine. The specific enamine used is 2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pent-1-ene. This compound is treated with a large excess of deuterated water ($D_2O$) and a catalytic amount of a strong acid, which can be represented as $D^+$. The hydrolysis reaction proceeds to completion, yielding 2-pentanone as the final ketone product. The carbon atoms of the 2-pentanone product are numbered sequentially from C1 to C5, beginning with the methyl carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, such that the carbonyl carbon is C2.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the final location of deuterium atoms ($D$) on the carbon skeleton of the 2-pentanone molecule after it has fully equilibrated under the reaction conditions?\n\nA. Deuterium atoms will be incorporated, replacing hydrogen atoms, only at the C1 position.\nB. Deuterium atoms will be incorporated, replacing hydrogen atoms, only at the C3 position.\nC. Deuterium atoms will be incorporated, replacing hydrogen atoms, at both the C1 and C3 positions.\nD. Deuterium atoms will be incorporated, replacing hydrogen atoms, at the C1, C3, and C4 positions.\nE. No deuterium atoms will be incorporated onto the carbon skeleton; they will only be found in the pyrrolidine by-product and as $D_2O$.", "solution": "We first identify the structure and carbon numbering of the product 2-pentanone. Numbering as stated: the methyl carbon adjacent to the carbonyl is C1, the carbonyl carbon is C2, then the methylene next to the carbonyl on the other side is C3, followed by C4 and the terminal methyl C5. Thus, both C1 and C3 are the positions alpha to the carbonyl group.\n\nReaction sequence and isotopic source: The enamine 2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pent-1-ene is the enamine derived from 2-pentanone and pyrrolidine. Under strongly acidic, aqueous conditions ($D_{2}O$ with catalytic $D^{+}$), enamines hydrolyze via an iminium intermediate to give the corresponding carbonyl compound (here, 2-pentanone) and the amine by-product (pyrrolidine). Throughout hydrolysis and after formation of the ketone, the medium provides deuterons ($D^{+}$) and solvent $D_{2}O$ as the exchange reservoir for hydrogen/deuterium.\n\nPrinciple governing deuterium incorporation on the carbon skeleton: In acidic $D_{2}O$, ketones undergo acid-catalyzed keto-enol tautomerization, which leads to H/D exchange specifically at the alpha positions. The mechanism is:\n- Protonation (deuteronation) of the carbonyl oxygen increases the acidity of alpha C–H bonds: $RCOR' + D^{+} \\to$ O-deuteronated carbonyl.\n- A base (here $D_{2}O$) removes an alpha hydrogen to form the enol: O-deuteronated enol $RC(OD)=CR'$, placing the double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the alpha carbon.\n- Re-tautomerization (reprotonation at carbon) from the enol back to the ketone occurs by addition of $D^{+}$ at the alpha carbon, installing a C–D bond at that position.\n- Repetition of this reversible sequence allows exhaustive exchange of all alpha hydrogens with deuterium.\n\nApplication to 2-pentanone: Both C1 and C3 are alpha to the carbonyl, so each position undergoes the above exchange. Although the more substituted enol (from C3) is typically formed faster and is more populated under acid catalysis, the problem states the system is allowed to fully equilibrate in a large excess of $D_{2}O$. Therefore, both sets of alpha hydrogens (those at C1 and at C3) are ultimately replaced by deuterium. Positions not alpha to the carbonyl (C4 and C5) do not exchange under these conditions because there is no mechanism analogous to keto-enol tautomerization that transfers $D$ to those non-activated sites in simple acid-catalyzed aqueous media. Any exchange at oxygen (O–H/O–D) occurs rapidly but is not part of the carbon skeleton specification.\n\nConclusion: After complete equilibration under the stated conditions, deuterium incorporation on the carbon skeleton is found at both alpha positions, C1 and C3, and not at C4 or elsewhere.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2171600"}]}
