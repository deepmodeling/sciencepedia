In the base-catalyzed mechanism, the hydroxide ion functions as a potent nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon to form a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n\nC.

Statement E is also correct: the final step is deprotonation of the oxonium intermediate by water, regenerating the acid catalyst.\n\nFor base-catalyzed hydration, the sequence is:\n(1) Nucleophilic attack by $HO^{-}$ at the electrophilic carbonyl carbon to form a tetrahedral alkoxide:\n$$R(R')C=O + HO^{-} \\rightarrow R(R')C(OH)O^{-}.$$\n(2) Protonation of the alkoxide by $H_{2}O$ to form the gem-diol and regenerate $HO^{-}$:\n$$R(R')C(OH)O^{-} + H_{2}O \\rightleftharpoons R(R')C(OH)_{2} + HO^{-}.$$\nThus, statement B is correct: hydroxide acts as a nucleophile forming a tetrahedral alkoxide. Statement D is also correct: the final step is proton transfer from water to the alkoxide, regenerating hydroxide.\n\nStatement C is incorrect on multiple mechanistic grounds. In base-catalyzed hydration, $HO^{-}$ does not first deprotonate $H_{2}O$; $HO^{-}$ is already the conjugate base of water, so deprotonating $H_{2}O$ to generate an \"oxygen radical\" is both chemically incorrect and thermodynamically nonsensical. No radical species are involved in the standard base-catalyzed hydration; the operative first step is nucleophilic addition of $HO^{-}$ to the carbonyl carbon, followed by proton transfer from $H_{2}O$.
