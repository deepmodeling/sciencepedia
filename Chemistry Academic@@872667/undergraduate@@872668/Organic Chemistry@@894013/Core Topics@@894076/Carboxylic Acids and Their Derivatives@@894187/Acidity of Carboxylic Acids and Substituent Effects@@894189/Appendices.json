The biological impact and environmental fate of these acids are known to be highly dependent on their pKa values, as this determines their predominant charge state at the near-neutral pH of natural water systems. The chemist needs to arrange these compounds in order of increasing acidity to predict their behavior.\n\nThe five compounds identified are:\n1.  Acetic acid\n2.  Fluoroacetic acid\n3.  Chloroacetic acid\n4.  Cyanoacetic acid\n5.  2-Methylpropanoic acid\n\nWhich of the following options correctly arranges these five acids in order of increasing acidity (from weakest acid to strongest acid)?\n\nA. 2-Methylpropanoic acid < Acetic acid < Chloroacetic acid < Fluoroacetic acid < Cyanoacetic acid\n\nB.

Electron-withdrawing substituents on $R$ stabilize $R\\text{-COO}^{-}$ via the inductive effect, increasing $K_{a}$ and lowering $pK_{a}$ (thus increasing acidity), whereas electron-donating alkyl substituents destabilize $R\\text{-COO}^{-}$, decreasing $K_{a}$ and increasing $pK_{a}$ (thus decreasing acidity).\n\nComparisons:\n1) Between 2-methylpropanoic acid and acetic acid, the additional alkyl substitution in 2-methylpropanoic acid donates electron density relative to the methyl group in acetic acid, destabilizing the conjugate base more and making 2-methylpropanoic acid the weaker acid. Hence\n$$pK_{a}(\\text{2-methylpropanoic})>pK_{a}(\\text{acetic}).$$\n\n2) Between chloroacetic acid and fluoroacetic acid, fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine and exerts a stronger inductive electron-withdrawing effect, stabilizing the conjugate base more and making fluoroacetic acid the stronger acid.
