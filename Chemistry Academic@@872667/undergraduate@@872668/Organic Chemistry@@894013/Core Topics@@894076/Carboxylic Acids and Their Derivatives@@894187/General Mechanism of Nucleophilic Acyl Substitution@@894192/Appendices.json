This practice problem [@problem_id:2172664] challenges you to think critically about why some seemingly plausible reactions fail to proceed. By comparing the basicity of the incoming nucleophile and the potential leaving group, you can master the core principle that dictates the direction of these transformations: the reaction will always favor the expulsion of the weaker base.", "problem": "In a hypothetical experiment, a student attempts to synthesize an acyl chloride from an ester. The student mixes ethyl acetate ($CH_3COOCH_2CH_3$) with a large excess of sodium chloride ($NaCl$) in a suitable aprotic solvent, hoping to form acetyl chloride ($CH_3COCl$) and sodium ethoxide ($NaOCH_2CH_3$). Despite heating the mixture, no significant amount of acetyl chloride is formed.\n\nThe general mechanism for nucleophilic acyl substitution involves the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate, which then collapses by expelling a leaving group. The success of the reaction is largely determined by the relative stability of the potential leaving groups. A more stable leaving group is a weaker base.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best chemical reasoning for why this reaction does not proceed as intended?\n\nA. The chloride ion ($Cl^−$) is a much stronger base than the ethoxide ion ($CH_3CH_2O^−$), and therefore the chloride ion cannot displace the ethoxide group.\n\nB. The sodium cation ($Na^+$) strongly coordinates to the ethoxide leaving group, preventing it from dissociating from the tetrahedral intermediate.\n\nC. The ethoxide ion ($CH_3CH_2O^−$) is a much stronger base than the chloride ion ($Cl^−$), making ethoxide a very poor leaving group compared to chloride.\n\nD. The ester's carbonyl group is not electrophilic enough to be attacked by a relatively weak nucleophile like the chloride ion; an acid catalyst is required.\n\nE. The chloride ion is sterically hindered and too large to effectively attack the compact carbonyl carbon of ethyl acetate.", "solution": "We consider the nucleophilic acyl substitution pathway. In the first step, a nucleophile $Cl^{-}$ may attack the carbonyl carbon of the ester $CH_{3}COOCH_{2}CH_{3}$ to give a tetrahedral intermediate:\n$$\nCH_{3}COOCH_{2}CH_{3} + Cl^{-} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{(tetrahedral intermediate)}.\n$$\nThis intermediate can collapse by expelling one of two potential leaving groups: either $Cl^{-}$ or $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}$. The direction of collapse is governed by leaving group ability, which is inversely related to basicity: the weaker base is the better leaving group.\n\nTo compare basicities, we use $pK_{a}$ of the conjugate acids. For $Cl^{-}$, the conjugate acid is $\\mathrm{HCl}$ with $pK_{a} \\ll 0$, while for $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}$, the conjugate acid is ethanol with $pK_{a} \\approx 16$. Since higher $pK_{a}$ of the conjugate acid corresponds to a stronger base, we have:\n$$\n\\text{basicity: } CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-} \\gg Cl^{-}.\n$$\nTherefore, $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}$ is a much stronger base and thus a much poorer leaving group than $Cl^{-}$. Consequently, when the tetrahedral intermediate collapses, it preferentially expels the better leaving group $Cl^{-}$ rather than $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}$. This regenerates the starting ester instead of forming $CH_{3}COCl$:\n$$\n\\text{(tetrahedral intermediate)} \\to CH_{3}COOCH_{2}CH_{3} + Cl^{-}.\n$$\nHence, the equilibrium strongly disfavors substitution of $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}$ by $Cl^{-}$, and the attempted conversion of an ester to an acid chloride does not proceed. This directly supports the statement that the ethoxide ion is a much stronger base than chloride, making ethoxide a very poor leaving group compared to chloride.\n\nTherefore, the best reasoning is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2172664"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand the role of the leaving group, we can explore factors that modulate the reactivity of the acyl compound itself. This exercise [@problem_id:2172677] focuses on how substituents on an aromatic ring influence the rate of hydrolysis of an ester. You will apply your knowledge of electronic effects—both inductive and resonance—to determine how electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups alter the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, thereby speeding up or slowing down the reaction.", "problem": "Consider the following three aromatic esters, designated as I, II, and III, which are subjected to acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n\nI.

III > II > I", "solution": "Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an ester proceeds via the following general steps: (i) protonation of the carbonyl oxygen to form a more electrophilic protonated ester, (ii) nucleophilic attack by water at the carbonyl carbon to form a tetrahedral intermediate, and (iii) elimination to give the acid and the alcohol. The rate-determining step commonly involves nucleophilic attack on the protonated carbonyl, so the rate increases with the electrophilicity of the acyl carbon.\n\nFor aromatic esters of benzoic acid, substituents on the ring modulate the electrophilicity of the acyl carbon through resonance and inductive effects transmitted via the conjugated ring-carbonyl system. This effect is quantitatively captured by the Hammett relationship\n$$\n\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{k}{k_{0}}\\right)=\\rho\\,\\sigma,\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the rate constant for a given para substituent, $k_{0}$ is the rate for the unsubstituted case, $\\sigma$ is the substituent constant, and $\\rho$ reflects the sensitivity of the reaction to substituent effects. For acyl-addition processes in acid (electrophilic acyl center in the transition state), $\\rho>0$, so electron-withdrawing substituents with $\\sigma>0$ increase the rate and electron-donating substituents with $\\sigma0$ decrease the rate.\n\nApplying this to the three para-substituted benzoate esters:\n- For II (ethyl p-nitrobenzoate), the $\\text{NO}_{2}$ group is strongly electron withdrawing by both $-M$ and $-I$ effects, increasing the positive character at the carbonyl carbon in the protonated ester and stabilizing the developing positive charge in the transition state. Therefore $k_{\\text{II}}$ is maximized.\n- For I (ethyl benzoate), there is no substituent, giving the reference rate $k_{0}$.\n- For III (ethyl p-methoxybenzoate), the $\\text{OCH}_{3}$ group is strongly electron donating by $+M$ (despite a weak $-I$), which decreases the electrophilicity of the acyl carbon and destabilizes the cationic character in the transition state relative to I. Therefore $k_{\\text{III}}$ is minimized.\n\nThus the order of decreasing reactivity towards acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is\n$$\n\\text{II}\\text{I}\\text{III},\n$$\nwhich corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2172677"}, {"introduction": "Let's apply these principles to a common synthetic reaction that often yields unexpected results for the uninitiated. This problem [@problem_id:2172699] explores the reaction of an ester with a Grignard reagent, a powerful organometallic nucleophile.

Because the ketone is more electrophilic, the remaining $n_{E}-x$ moles of Grignard react with ketone until one reagent is depleted. To minimize accumulation of ketone (which is typically not isolated), the system proceeds such that $x=n_{E}/2$, consuming all remaining Grignard with the ketone to give $n_{E}/2$ moles of tertiary alcohol and leaving $n_{E}/2$ moles of unreacted ester. Thus, with one equivalent of Grignard, the principal product formed from the Grignard addition is the tertiary alcohol $C_{6}H_{5}C(OH)(CH_{3})_{2}$, i.e., 2-phenyl-2-propanol.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the tertiary alcohol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2172699"}]}
