Methyl 2,2-dimethylpropanoate will react faster because the electron-donating tert-butyl group activates the carbonyl carbon toward nucleophilic attack.\n\nB. Methyl acetate will react faster because the small methyl group on its acyl portion offers significantly less steric hindrance to the attacking nucleophile compared to the bulky tert-butyl group.\n\nC. Methyl 2,2-dimethylpropanoate will react faster because the bulky tert-butyl group helps to stabilize the negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate through hyperconjugation.\n\nD. Methyl acetate will react faster because the methyl group attached to its carbonyl is a better leaving group than the tert-butyl group of methyl 2,2-dimethylpropanoate.\n\nE. The two esters will react at nearly the same rate because the reacting center is the ester functional group, and both reactions involve the same nucleophile (hydroxide) and the same leaving group (methoxide).", "solution": "We consider base-promoted ester hydrolysis (saponification), which proceeds by nucleophilic acyl substitution. The accepted mechanism under basic conditions involves:\n1) Nucleophilic attack by hydroxide on the carbonyl carbon to form a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n2) Collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate with expulsion of methoxide as the leaving group.\n3) Fast acid-base steps leading to carboxylate and methanol.\n\nThe rate-determining step for ester saponification is generally the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate (nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl). The empirical rate law is second order:\n$$\n\\text{rate}_{i} = k_{i}[\\text{ester}_{i}][\\text{OH}^{-}],\n$$\nso, under identical initial concentrations, the initial rates are governed by the relative magnitudes of $k_{i}$ for the two esters.\n\nFrom transition state theory,\n$$\nk_{i} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{h}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{i}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\nso the ester with the smaller $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ for the nucleophilic addition step will react faster.\n\nTwo key factors control $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ here:\n- Steric effects at the acyl carbon: A bulkier group adjacent to the carbonyl increases steric repulsion in both the approach of $\\text{OH}^{-}$ and in the congested tetrahedral transition state, raising $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreasing $k$.\n- Electronic (inductive) effects: Alkyl groups donate electron density by induction, decreasing the partial positive charge at the carbonyl carbon and reducing its electrophilicity.

By nucleophilic acyl substitution principles, more reactive acyl derivatives convert to less reactive ones in high yield when an appropriate nucleophile is present. The general reactivity order is acyl chlorides more reactive than anhydrides more reactive than esters approximately comparable to carboxylic acids more reactive than amides. Direct aminolysis of esters is slow and often equilibrium-limited because the leaving group is an alkoxide, and the reverse transesterification is facile; additionally, amines are partially protonated by alcohol byproducts, reducing nucleophilicity. Therefore, a high-yield route typically proceeds by converting the ester to a more reactive derivative (e.g., an acid chloride) before amide formation.\n\nEvaluate option A. Step 1 is base-promoted hydrolysis (saponification) of the ester to the carboxylate, followed by acidification to the carboxylic acid:\n$$\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}COOCH_{2}CH_{3}}+\\mathrm{NaOH}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}COO}^{-}Na^{+}+\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}OH}$$\n$$\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}COO}^{-}Na^{+}+\\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}COOH}+\\mathrm{Na^{+}}+\\mathrm{H_{2}O}$$\nStep 2 converts the acid to the acid chloride, then performs aminolysis to the amide:\n$$\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}COOH}+\\mathrm{SOCl_{2}}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}COCl}+\\mathrm{SO_{2}}+\\mathrm{HCl}$$\n$$\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}COCl}+\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}NH_{2}}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}CONHCH_{2}CH_{3}}+\\mathrm{HCl}$$\nUsing excess amine or an added base neutralizes the formed $\\mathrm{HCl}$, driving the reaction to completion. This is a standard, high-yield laboratory sequence because acid chlorides are highly susceptible to nucleophilic attack by amines, and the gaseous byproducts in the $\\mathrm{SOCl_{2}}$ step help drive acid chloride formation to completion.\n\nEvaluate option B. Step 1 hydrolyzes the ester under acidic conditions to propanoic acid. Step 2 proposes reaction with $\\mathrm{NaNH_{2}}$, which is a strong base and will simply deprotonate the carboxylic acid to give the carboxylate and ammonia rather than form an amide:\n$$\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}COOH}+\\mathrm{NaNH_{2}}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}COO}^{-}Na^{+}+\\mathrm{NH_{3}}$$\nNo amide formation occurs without prior activation of the carboxylic acid or the use of a coupling reagent with an amine nucleophile.\n\nEvaluate option C. Direct reaction of the ester with excess ethylamine:\n$$\\mathrm{RCOOEt}+\\mathrm{EtNH_{2}}\\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{RCONHEt}+\\mathrm{EtOH}$$\nThis equilibrium is not strongly product-favored for esters, and the rate is low. The stem states this route is extremely slow and low-yield, confirming it is not efficient. Step 2 is merely a purification, not a chemical transformation that addresses the fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic issues.\n\nEvaluate option D. $\\mathrm{LiAlH_{4}}$ reduces esters to primary alcohols:\n$$\\mathrm{RCOOEt}\\xrightarrow[\\mathrm{H_{2}O}]{\\mathrm{LiAlH_{4}}}\\mathrm{RCH_{2}OH}+\\mathrm{EtOH}$$\nSubsequent DCC coupling with propanoic acid and an alcohol furnishes an ester, not an amide:\n$$\\mathrm{RCH_{2}OH}+\\mathrm{R'COOH}\\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{DCC}}\\mathrm{R'COOR}$$\nThis does not produce N-ethylpropanamide.\n\nEvaluate option E. Treatment with sodium ethoxide in ethanol leads to no productive conversion toward an amide; it simply sets up transesterification equilibria with the same alkoxy group and does not activate the acyl group toward amines. The second step then reverts to the inefficient direct aminolysis discussed in option C.\n\nTherefore, the most efficient and practical two-step synthesis is option A: hydrolyze the ester to the carboxylic acid, convert to the acid chloride with $\\mathrm{SOCl_{2}}$, then react with ethylamine to afford N-ethylpropanamide in high yield.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2197038"}]}
