This exercise focuses on a fundamental predictive skill: determining the structure of the resulting amine based on the starting amide's substitution.

Throughout, the $C-N$ bond is retained, so the substitution pattern on nitrogen is preserved.\n\nApplication to the given substrates:\n1) Propanamide, $CH_3CH_2CONH_2$, is a primary amide.
