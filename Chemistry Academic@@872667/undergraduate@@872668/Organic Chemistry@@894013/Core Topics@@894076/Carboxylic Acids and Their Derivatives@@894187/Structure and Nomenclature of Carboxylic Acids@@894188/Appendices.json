Saturated monocarboxylic acids follow the general formula $C_nH_{2n}O_2$, so $n=4$ is consistent with a C4 carboxylic acid.\n\nWe enumerate the possible structural isomers that preserve the carboxylic acid functional group for four carbons:\n- A straight-chain acid with four carbons is butanoic acid; this is a valid carboxylic acid isomer with formula $C_4H_8O_2$.\n- A branched acid with three carbons in the main chain plus one methyl substituent on the $\\alpha$-carbon is 2-methylpropanoic acid; this is also a valid carboxylic acid isomer with formula $C_4H_8O_2$.\nThere are no other distinct carboxylic acid structures with four total carbons that are different by IUPAC rules: placing the methyl at the $\\beta$-position would simply be another numbering of the same compound due to the carboxyl carbon being position 1.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A. Butanoic acid: correct systematic IUPAC name for one valid isomer.\n- B. 2-Methylpropanoic acid: correct systematic IUPAC name for the other valid isomer.\n- C.

This problem presents a scenario where you must act as a peer reviewer to diagnose an error in a proposed name. By analyzing '3-propylbutanoic acid', you will reinforce the critical rule that the parent chain must be the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the principal functional group. [@problem_id:2204951]", "problem": "An undergraduate student is working on synthesizing an organic compound. After spectral analysis, the student confidently identifies the product as an acyclic carboxylic acid and proposes the name '3-propylbutanoic acid' according to the rules of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). However, this name is incorrect because it violates a fundamental IUPAC rule. Your task is to identify the specific error in the student's application of the IUPAC nomenclature rules for this molecule.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the error made in naming the compound '3-propylbutanoic acid'?\n\nA. The principal functional group was incorrectly identified.\nB. The parent chain was numbered from the wrong end.\nC. The parent chain was not the longest continuous carbon chain containing the principal functional group.\nD. The substituent was named incorrectly.\nE. The substituents were not listed in alphabetical order.", "solution": "Apply IUPAC nomenclature rules step by step:\n1) Identify the principal functional group. For an acyclic carboxylic acid, the carboxyl group is the highest-priority functional group and must define the suffix “-oic acid”. Thus the functional group identification in the student’s name is not the source of error.\n2) Select the parent chain. The IUPAC rule requires choosing the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the carboxyl carbon. In the proposed name “3-propylbutanoic acid,” the parent chosen is a four-carbon chain (butanoic acid) with a propyl substituent at carbon 3. However, at the branching carbon, one can trace a longer continuous chain by proceeding through the three-carbon substituent instead of continuing to the terminal methyl of the four-carbon chain. This yields a six-carbon chain that still contains the carboxyl carbon, so the correct parent should be hexanoic acid rather than butanoic acid. Consequently, the proposed name violates the “longest chain containing the principal functional group” rule.\n3) Numbering and substituent naming are not the primary issues once the correct parent is chosen; with the six-carbon parent, the structure corresponds to a methyl-substituted hexanoic acid (e.g., 3-methylhexanoic acid), confirming that the initial error lies in parent-chain selection.\nTherefore, the specific error is that the parent chain was not the longest continuous chain containing the principal functional group, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2204951"}, {"introduction": "Truly mastering IUPAC nomenclature means being able to describe a molecule's three-dimensional structure with complete and unambiguous precision. This final challenge integrates multiple concepts, requiring you to name a molecule that contains both a chiral center and a carbon-carbon double bond. You will apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules to assign both the $(R/S)$ configuration of the stereocenter and the $(E/Z)$ geometry of the double bond, culminating in a complete stereochemical name.

The principal functional group is a carboxylic acid, and the longest continuous carbon chain containing this group consists of seven carbon atoms. The carboxyl carbon is designated as carbon-1.\n2.  A single carbon-carbon double bond is present between carbon-4 and carbon-5.\n3.  A single methyl group is attached to carbon-3, which is a chiral center.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the molecule is specified as follows:\n-   At the chiral center (carbon-3), the substituent with the lowest Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority is oriented away from the observer. When viewed from this perspective, the sequence from the highest-priority substituent to the second-highest priority, and then to the third-highest priority, traces a clockwise path.\n-   With respect to the double bond between carbon-4 and carbon-5, the substituent of higher CIP priority on carbon-4 and the substituent of higher CIP priority on carbon-5 are located on opposite sides of the double bond's axis.\n\nBased on this information, determine the complete and correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for this compound from the options provided below.\n\nA.

(5S, 3E)-5-methylhept-3-enoic acid", "solution": "The principal functional group is a carboxylic acid and the parent chain containing it has seven carbons with the carboxyl carbon as carbon-1, so the base name is hept-4-enoic acid, with a double bond between carbons 4 and 5, and a methyl substituent at carbon-3. Thus, the skeletal name is 3-methylhept-4-enoic acid.\n\nAssigning the absolute configuration at carbon-3 by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules:\n- The four substituents at C-3 are: hydrogen, methyl (C), the C-2 side leading to the carboxyl group (C), and the C-4 side leading toward the double bond (C).\n- Since three substituents are carbons, we compare their sets of directly attached atoms (excluding the stereocenter). For the C-4 substituent, the next atom is C-4, which is double-bonded to C-5 and single-bonded to H, so its attached set is effectively C, C, H. For the C-2 substituent, the next atom is C-2, attached to C-1, H, H, so its set is C, H, H. For the methyl substituent, the next atom is a carbon attached to H, H, H, so its set is H, H, H. By lexicographic comparison, the priority order is: C-4 side (highest) > C-2 side > methyl > hydrogen (lowest).\n- The problem states that with the lowest-priority substituent oriented away, the sequence from highest to second to third is clockwise. By the R/S convention, this corresponds to the R configuration at C-3. Therefore, the stereodescriptor at the chiral center is 3R.\n\nAssigning the double-bond configuration at C-4/C-5:\n- At C-4, the two substituents (excluding the double-bond partner) are H and the C-3 side; the C-3 side has higher priority than H.\n- At C-5, the two substituents are H and the C-6 side; the C-6 side has higher priority than H.\n- The problem states that the higher-priority substituents on C-4 and C-5 lie on opposite sides, which defines the E configuration. Therefore, the double bond is 4E.\n\nCombining these, the correct IUPAC name is (3R, 4E)-3-methylhept-4-enoic acid, which corresponds to option A. Options with Z, S, or with different locants (such as 5-methylhept-3-enoic acid) do not match the specified structure and stereochemistry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2204970"}]}
