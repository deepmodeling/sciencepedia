This statement is false. A linear combination of non-degenerate energy eigenfunctions (e.g., $\\psi_{1s}$ and $\\psi_{2s}$) is not an energy eigenfunction.\nB. This statement is correct. It precisely states the principle of linear combinations of degenerate states, which we have used to show that $\\Psi_{rot}$ is a stationary state.\nC. This is false. While the potential is spherically symmetric, most stationary states (like the p, d, f orbitals) are not. Only s-orbitals ($l=0$) are spherically symmetric.\nD. This is false. While it is true that $\\Psi_{rot}$ is not an eigenfunction of $\\hat{L}_z$, this is not a condition for a state to be stationary. The only requirement is that it must be an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian.\nE. This is false. The orientation of a state in space does not determine whether it is stationary.
