To determine this, we must use the formula for the Compton scattering wavelength shift.\n\nThe change in wavelength, $\\Delta \\lambda$, of a photon in a Compton scattering event is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta \\lambda = \\lambda' - \\lambda = \\frac{h}{m_t c}(1 - \\cos\\theta)\n$$\nwhere:\n- $\\lambda$ is the initial wavelength of the photon.\n- $\\lambda'$ is the scattered wavelength of the photon.\n- $h$ is Planck's constant.\n- $m_t$ is the rest mass of the target particle.\n- $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n- $\\theta$ is the scattering angle of the photon.\n\nThis formula is derived from the principles of conservation of relativistic energy and momentum for the photon-particle system. It is important to note that the electric charge of the target particle does not appear in this final expression for the wavelength shift.\n\nFirst, let's analyze Experiment E.

This is because both experiments use the same incident photon wavelength ($\\lambda$), the same scattering angle ($\\theta$), and the target particles (electron and positron) have the same rest mass. The opposite charge of the positron is irrelevant to the magnitude of the wavelength shift.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the wavelength shifts in both experiments are equal:\n$$\n\\Delta \\lambda_p = \\Delta \\lambda_e\n$$\nThis corresponds to option C.
