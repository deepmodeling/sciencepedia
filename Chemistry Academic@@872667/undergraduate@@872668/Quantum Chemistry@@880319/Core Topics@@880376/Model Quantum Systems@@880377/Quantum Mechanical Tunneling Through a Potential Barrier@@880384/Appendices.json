It is impossible to determine the relationship between $T_R$ and $T_T$ without knowing the specific values of the particle's mass $m$, its energy $E$, and the barrier parameters $V_0$ and $L$.", "solution": "The problem asks for a qualitative comparison of the tunneling probabilities through a rectangular barrier and a symmetric triangular barrier of the same maximum height and width.\n\nThe behavior of a particle in a potential $V(x)$ is governed by the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE):\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)$$\nwhere $\\psi(x)$ is the energy eigenstate (wavefunction), $m$ is the particle's mass, $E$ is its total energy, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nInside the potential barrier, where $V(x)  E$, the region is classically forbidden. We can rearrange the TISE to analyze the wavefunction's behavior in this region:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}[V(x)-E]\\psi(x)$$\nLet's define a position-dependent quantity $\\kappa(x)$:\n$$\\kappa(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}[V(x)-E]}$$\nWith this definition, the TISE inside the barrier becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = \\kappa(x)^2 \\psi(x)$$\nThe general solutions to this equation are of the form $\\exp(\\pm \\int \\kappa(x) dx)$. In the context of tunneling, this shows that the amplitude of the wavefunction decays exponentially as it penetrates the barrier. The quantity $\\kappa(x)$ can be interpreted as the **local decay constant** or **local attenuation rate**. A larger value of $\\kappa(x)$ at a given position means the wavefunction's amplitude decreases more rapidly at that point.\n\nThe total tunneling probability, $T$, is related to the overall attenuation of the wavefunction as it passes through the entire width of the barrier. A useful tool for estimating this is the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, which gives the transmission coefficient as:\n$$T \\approx \\exp\\left(-2 \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\kappa(x) dx\\right) = \\exp\\left(-2 \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}[V(x)-E]} dx\\right)$$\nwhere $[x_1, x_2]$ is the classically forbidden region. Although we are asked not to perform a full calculation, this formula formalizes our qualitative reasoning. A larger value of the integral in the exponent leads to a smaller tunneling probability.\n\nNow, let's compare the two barriers, $V_R(x)$ and $V_T(x)$, over the interval $0 \\le x \\le L$.\nFor the rectangular barrier, $V_R(x) = V_0$ for all $x$ in $[0, L]$.\nFor the triangular barrier, $V_T(x)$ varies from $0$ to $V_0$ and back to $0$. At every point $x$ within the open interval $(0, L)$, except for the single point $x=L/2$, the potential energy of the triangular barrier is strictly less than the potential energy of the rectangular barrier:\n$$V_T(x)  V_0 = V_R(x) \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0, L/2) \\cup (L/2, L)$$\nAt $x=L/2$, $V_T(L/2) = V_R(L/2) = V_0$.\n\nSince the local decay constant $\\kappa(x)$ depends on $V(x)$, we can compare $\\kappa_T(x)$ for the triangular barrier and $\\kappa_R(x)$ for the rectangular barrier. For any given energy $E  V_0$:\n$$\\kappa_T(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}[V_T(x)-E]} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\kappa_R(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}[V_R(x)-E]}$$\nBecause $V_T(x)  V_R(x)$ for almost all $x$ in the barrier region, it directly follows that:\n$$\\kappa_T(x)  \\kappa_R(x) \\quad \\text{for almost all } x \\in (0, L)$$\nThis means that at nearly every point inside the barrier, the wavefunction decays less steeply for the triangular barrier than for the rectangular one.\n\nThe total \"resistance\" of the barrier to tunneling is related to the integral of this local decay constant. Since $\\kappa_T(x)$ is smaller than $\\kappa_R(x)$ over the domain of integration, the integral will also be smaller:\n$$\\int_{a_T}^{b_T} \\kappa_T(x) dx  \\int_{0}^{L} \\kappa_R(x) dx$$\n(Note: The integration limits $[a_T, b_T]$ for the triangular barrier are the points where $V_T(x)=E$, which is a slightly smaller range than $[0,L]$, further reducing the integral's value compared to the rectangular case).\n\nSince the tunneling probability $T$ is approximately proportional to $\\exp(-2 \\times (\\text{integral}))$, a smaller positive integral in the exponent results in a larger overall value for $T$.\nTherefore, we conclude that the tunneling probability through the triangular barrier is greater than through the rectangular barrier: $T_T  T_R$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. Incorrect. A higher potential leads to a faster decay, hindering tunneling.\nB. Incorrect. This neglects the crucial role of the barrier's shape.\nC. Correct. This statement accurately identifies that the point-by-point potential height determines the local decay rate, and because the triangular barrier is \"thinner\" or lower for most of its width, the overall tunneling is more probable.\nD. This option reaches the correct conclusion ($T_T  T_R$) but provides imprecise reasoning. Tunneling probability is not a simple function of the average potential. As the WKB formula shows, it depends on the integral of $\\sqrt{V(x)-E}$, not the integral of $V(x)$. While a lower average potential is correlated with higher tunneling, it is not the direct physical cause. The reason in C is more fundamental.\nE. Incorrect. The relative probability can be determined qualitatively without specific numerical values, as the inequality $V_T(x)  V_R(x)$ holds for any valid set of parameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1389551"}]}
