Hybridization is favored only if the energy gained from forming stronger bonds outweighs the initial energy cost of promoting electrons. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1396065] uses a simplified energetic model to quantify this trade-off for phosphine ($\\text{PH}_3$), helping to explain why its bond angles deviate significantly from the ideal $sp^3$ case and why larger atoms sometimes favor bonding with nearly unhybridized p-orbitals.", "problem": "The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model often predicts that molecules like ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$) and phosphine ($\\text{PH}_3$) should have a tetrahedral electron geometry, implying $sp^3$ hybridization of the central atom and bond angles near $109.5^\\circ$. While ammonia's H-N-H bond angle of $107.8^\\circ$ is close to this prediction, phosphine's H-P-H bond angle is experimentally found to be $93.5^\\circ$, which is very close to the $90^\\circ$ angle between unhybridized p-orbitals.\n\nTo investigate this discrepancy quantitatively, consider a simplified energetic model for the formation of phosphine. We will compare two hypothetical bonding schemes for the central phosphorus atom, starting from a ground-state phosphorus atom (valence configuration $3s^2 3p^3$) and three hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Scheme 1 (Unhybridized):** The phosphorus atom uses its three half-filled $3p$ orbitals to form three P-H bonds with hydrogen's $1s$ orbitals.

This provides a quantitative justification for why phosphine prefers to use orbitals that are primarily p-like in character for bonding, resulting in bond angles close to $90^\\circ$.
