The atoms O–C2–C1 form a three-atom conjugated system in which all three centers possess $p$ orbitals and can participate in a delocalized $\\pi$ system.\n\nBy Valence Bond resonance theory, the enolate is described by major resonance contributors that differ in the placement of the $\\pi$ bond and the formal negative charge:\n- Carbanion contributor: the carbonyl remains as $\\mathrm{C2}=\\mathrm{O}$ and the lone pair resides on C1. Symbolically, this places the formal negative charge on C1 (with a $\\pi$ bond localized between C2 and O).\n- Oxyanion contributor: the $\\pi$ bond shifts to $\\mathrm{C1}=\\mathrm{C2}$ and the oxygen bears the lone pair, placing the formal negative charge on O (with a single bond between C2 and O).\n\nThese two contributors are connected by $\\pi$-electron delocalization over the O–C2–C1 framework via overlap of adjacent $p$ orbitals. The carbonyl carbon C2 serves as the central atom of the conjugated system and does not carry a formal negative charge in the major contributors; instead, the negative charge is delocalized between the terminal atoms C1 and O.

This problem challenges you to apply resonance theory to predict a key thermodynamic property: the enthalpy of hydrogenation. By comparing a conjugated diene with an isolated diene, you will see how delocalization directly impacts a molecule's potential energy and stability.

A key performance metric is the molar enthalpy of hydrogenation, which represents the heat released when one mole of the compound is completely reacted with hydrogen gas to form n-pentane (C5H12). A more exothermic reaction (i.e., a more negative enthalpy change) indicates a higher energy content in the starting fuel molecule.\n\nWithout access to experimental thermodynamic data, the team must use principles from Valence Bond theory to predict which isomer would serve as the most potent fuel in this context. Your task is to determine which of the following compounds would exhibit the most exothermic (most negative) standard enthalpy of hydrogenation.\n\nA. 1,4-Pentadiene\n\nB. (Z)-1,3-Pentadiene\n\nC.

In VB terms, 1,3-dienes have resonance hybrids of alternating single and double bonds that delocalize bonding, lowering the energy by a resonance stabilization $E_{\\text{res}} > 0$. Hence, conjugated dienes are more stable (lower $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}$) than isolated dienes with the same substitution.\n- Alkene substitution and hyperconjugation further stabilize double bonds. Disubstituted alkenes are more stabilized than monosubstituted ones.\n- For stereoisomers, the trans (E) alkene is typically more stable than the cis (Z) due to reduced steric repulsion, hence $(E)$ is lower in $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}$ than $(Z)$.\n\nApply these to the candidates:\n- A. 1,4-Pentadiene, CH$_{2}$=CH–CH$_{2}$–CH=CH$_{2}$, is an isolated diene with two terminal, monosubstituted double bonds. It lacks conjugative stabilization between the double bonds and has the least substitution, making it the least stabilized (largest $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}$).\n- B. (Z)-1,3-Pentadiene is a conjugated diene. Conjugation lowers $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}$ relative to A. However, the $(Z)$ geometry is less stable than $(E)$ due to steric interactions, so its $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}$ is higher than that of $(E)$ but lower than A.\n- C. (E)-1,3-Pentadiene is the most stable among the dienes due to both conjugation and the more favorable trans geometry, giving the smallest $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}$ of A–C.\n- D. Pentane has no double bonds; its “complete hydrogenation to pentane” consumes zero hydrogen and has\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{hyd}}^{\\circ}(\\text{pentane})=0,\n$$\nso it is not the most exothermic.\n\nRanking by stability (most to least stable): C > B > A. Consequently, by the relation above, the magnitude of the exothermic hydrogenation (most negative $\\Delta H_{\\text{hyd}}^{\\circ}$) follows A > B > C, with D equal to zero. Therefore, the most exothermic hydrogenation is for 1,4-pentadiene.\n\nNote: Although the narrative mentions acyclic C$_{5}$H$_{8}$ isomers, option D is not C$_{5}$H$_{8}$.

This exercise uses the allene molecule to illustrate a crucial exception, highlighting that the geometry of atomic orbitals is the ultimate gatekeeper for electron delocalization.

In the context of Valence Bond (VB) theory and the concept of resonance, its electronic properties differ significantly from those of conjugated dienes like 1,3-butadiene ($H_2C=CH-CH=CH_2$). Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for why allene does not exhibit the extensive pi-electron delocalization characteristic of conjugated systems?\n\nA. All carbon atoms in allene are sp²-hybridized, but steric hindrance between the terminal hydrogen atoms twists the molecule, breaking the pi-system conjugation.\n\nB. The central carbon atom in allene is sp-hybridized, utilizing two orthogonal p-orbitals to form two separate pi bonds with the sp²-hybridized terminal carbons. This perpendicular arrangement of the two pi systems prevents continuous overlap across the carbon backbone.\n\nC. Allene is a fully conjugated system because the sequence of double bonds allows for resonance structures like $^{+}CH_2-C\\equiv CH_2^{-}$, which significantly lowers the overall energy of the molecule through delocalization.\n\nD. The terminal carbon atoms in allene are sp-hybridized and the central carbon is sp²-hybridized. This hybridization mismatch prevents the formation of a stable, delocalized molecular orbital.\n\nE. The high electronegativity of the central sp-hybridized carbon atom localizes the pi electrons, preventing them from delocalizing across the terminal carbons.", "solution": "In valence bond terms, conjugation and extensive delocalization require a continuous set of adjacent, parallel $p$ orbitals that can overlap simultaneously to form delocalized $\\pi$ molecular orbitals. In 1,3-butadiene, each of the four carbon atoms is sp²-hybridized and contributes one unhybridized $p$ orbital; these four $p$ orbitals are all parallel, allowing continuous overlap and formation of delocalized $\\pi$ bonding across the chain.\n\nFor allene $H_{2}C=C=CH_{2}$, the central carbon is sp-hybridized because it forms two $\\sigma$ bonds along a straight line to the terminal carbons. This leaves two unhybridized $p$ orbitals on the central carbon, which we may denote $p_{x}$ and $p_{y}$, and these are orthogonal. Each terminal carbon is sp²-hybridized and carries one unhybridized $p$ orbital. One of the central carbon’s $p$ orbitals overlaps with the $p$ orbital on one terminal carbon to form one $\\pi$ bond, while the other central $p$ orbital overlaps with the other terminal carbon’s $p$ orbital to form the other $\\pi$ bond. Because the two central $p$ orbitals are perpendicular, the two terminal $p$ orbitals that they overlap with are also arranged in mutually perpendicular planes. Consequently, the two $\\pi$ systems are orthogonal and do not overlap with each other; there is no continuous, co-planar chain of parallel $p$ orbitals spanning all three carbons. This orthogonality fundamentally prevents the extensive $\\pi$-electron delocalization characteristic of conjugated systems.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because not all carbons in allene are sp²-hybridized, and the orthogonal arrangement arises from the $sp$ central carbon’s two perpendicular $p$ orbitals rather than steric twisting.\n- B correctly states that the central carbon is sp-hybridized, uses two orthogonal $p$ orbitals to form two separate $\\pi$ bonds, and that this perpendicular arrangement prevents continuous overlap across the carbon backbone.\n- C is incorrect because allene is not fully conjugated; charge-separated resonance forms such as $^{+}CH_{2}-C\\equiv CH_{2}^{-}$ are not dominant contributors and do not reflect extensive delocalization across all three carbons.\n- D is incorrect because the terminal carbons are sp² and the central is sp, not the reverse.\n- E is incorrect because invoking a large electronegativity difference for the $sp$ carbon to explain localization is not the primary or fundamental reason; the key reason is orbital orthogonality.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is given by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1391312"}]}
