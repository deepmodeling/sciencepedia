This resonance treatment suggests some delocalization and potential stabilization from mixing the two structures, but it does not naturally produce a paramagnetic triplet ground state unless one explicitly includes significant diradical (ionic or biradical) structures and a more sophisticated spin-coupling scheme. Thus, the simple VB resonance model fails to predict the paramagnetic triplet ground state that the Hückel MO model obtains for the symmetric square geometry.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate contrast is that the simple VB model implies some stabilization and delocalization without predicting a paramagnetic ground state, whereas the Hückel MO model predicts a triplet ground state with two unpaired electrons in degenerate nonbonding orbitals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1359110"}, {"introduction": "Valence Bond and Molecular Orbital theories are often presented as distinct approaches, but they are deeply connected languages for describing electronic structure.
