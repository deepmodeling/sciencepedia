Bond Order = 2.0, Diamagnetic", "solution": "We start by determining the total number of electrons in $B_2^{-}$. Each boron atom has atomic number $5$, so a neutral $B_2$ has $10$ electrons. The anion $B_2^{-}$ has one extra electron, hence $11$ total electrons. For bonding and magnetism, the $1s$ core orbitals are fully occupied and form $\\sigma_{1s}$ and $\\sigma_{1s}^{*}$ pairs that cancel in bond order and contribute no unpaired electrons. Therefore, we focus on the valence electrons. Each boron contributes $3$ valence electrons ($2s^2 2p^1$), so neutral $B_2$ has $6$ valence electrons, and $B_2^-$ has $7$ valence electrons.\n\nFor second-row homonuclear diatomics with $Z < 8$ (i.e., B, C, N), the relevant molecular orbital energy ordering for the valence shell is\n$$\n\\sigma_{2s},\\ \\sigma_{2s}^{*},\\ \\pi_{2p_{x}}=\\pi_{2p_{y}},\\ \\sigma_{2p_{z}},\\ \\pi_{2p}^{*},\\ \\sigma_{2p}^{*}.\n$$\nWe fill the $7$ valence electrons according to the Aufbau principle, Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund’s rule:\n- Fill $\\sigma_{2s}$ with $2$ electrons: $n(\\sigma_{2s})=2$.\n- Fill $\\sigma_{2s}^{*}$ with $2$ electrons: $n(\\sigma_{2s}^{*})=2$.\n- The remaining $3$ electrons go into the degenerate $\\pi_{2p_{x}}$ and $\\pi_{2p_{y}}$ orbitals.

Thus, across the two $\\pi$ orbitals we have $3$ electrons total with one unpaired: $n(\\pi_{2p})=3$.\n\nThe bond order is given by\n$$\n\\text{BO}=\\frac{N_{b}-N_{a}}{2},\n$$\nwhere $N_{b}$ is the total number of electrons in bonding MOs and $N_{a}$ is the total in antibonding MOs.

This final practice challenges you to rank the bond lengths of $N_2$, $CO$, and $CN^-$, all of which have the same number of electrons and the same formal bond order of 3. To solve this, you must consider secondary effects like electronegativity differences and charge repulsion, refining your understanding of the factors that govern molecular structure [@problem_id:1366385].", "problem": "In the study of cold, dense interstellar clouds, spectroscopic analysis reveals the presence of various simple molecules.
