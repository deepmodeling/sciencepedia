{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Our journey begins with the most direct application of the Pauli Exclusion Principle: building the electronic structure of an atom. By treating each electron as having a unique 'address' defined by four quantum numbers, the principle dictates how many electrons can fit into any given energy shell. This exercise [@problem_id:1411758] will guide you through this fundamental counting process, which forms the very basis of the periodic table's organization.", "problem": "In the quantum mechanical description of an atom, the state of an individual electron is uniquely defined by a set of four quantum numbers: the principal quantum number ($n$), the azimuthal quantum number ($l$), the magnetic quantum number ($m_l$), and the spin quantum number ($m_s$). The allowed values for these numbers are governed by specific rules:\n- $n$ can be any positive integer ($1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).\n- For a given $n$, $l$ can be any integer from $0$ to $n-1$.\n- For a given $l$, $m_l$ can be any integer from $-l$ to $+l$, including $0$.\n- $m_s$ can be either $+\\frac{1}{2}$ or $-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates that no two electrons within a single atom can have the same set of these four quantum numbers. Using these principles, determine the maximum number of electrons that can occupy the principal energy shell defined by $n=3$. Provide your answer as an integer.", "solution": "We apply the quantum number rules and the Pauli Exclusion Principle to count distinct electron states in the shell with principal quantum number $n=3$.\n\nFor a given $n$, the allowed azimuthal quantum numbers are $l=0,1,\\ldots,n-1$. Thus for $n=3$, the allowed values are $l=0,1,2$.\n\nFor a given $l$, the allowed magnetic quantum numbers are $m_{l}=-l,-l+1,\\ldots,l-1,l$, giving a total of $(2l+1)$ possible $m_{l}$ values.\n\nFor each $(n,l,m_{l})$ spatial state, the spin quantum number can be $m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ or $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$, producing $2$ spin states. Therefore, for each fixed $l$, the number of distinct electron states is\n$$\nN_{l}=2(2l+1).\n$$\n\nSumming over all allowed $l$ for $n=3$,\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}}=\\sum_{l=0}^{2} 2(2l+1)=2\\left[(2\\cdot 0+1)+(2\\cdot 1+1)+(2\\cdot 2+1)\\right]=2(1+3+5)=2\\cdot 9=18.\n$$\n\nEquivalently, using the general identity $\\sum_{l=0}^{n-1}(2l+1)=n^{2}$, the total number of states in the shell $n$ is\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}}=2\\sum_{l=0}^{n-1}(2l+1)=2n^{2},\n$$\nand for $n=3$ this gives $2\\cdot 3^{2}=18$.\n\nBy the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each electron must have a unique set $(n,l,m_{l},m_{s})$, so the maximum number of electrons that can occupy the $n=3$ shell equals the number of distinct states computed above.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{18}$$", "id": "1411758"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how the Pauli principle organizes fermions, a powerful way to appreciate its impact is to imagine a world without it. This thought experiment [@problem_id:2017174] asks you to consider a universe where electrons behave as bosons, which do not obey the exclusion principle.

Spin-0 implies total spin quantum number $S=0$ and hence spin multiplicity $2S+1=1$, i.e., there is only one spin state. By the spin-statistics connection, identical spin-0 particles are bosons, so the Pauli exclusion principle does not apply. Consequently, any number of these particles can occupy the same one-particle quantum state.\n\nAtomic orbitals are single-particle eigenstates labeled by $(n,\\ell,m)$ with energies ordered as $1s$ lowest, then $2s$, $2p$, etc. For a bosonic system of $N$ identical particles, the many-body ground state is obtained by placing as many particles as possible in the lowest single-particle energy state, because there is no exclusion constraint limiting occupancy. Therefore, for a neutral atom with atomic number $Z=4$, there are $N=4$ such particles, and the energy-minimizing configuration is to put all four into the lowest orbital, the $1s$ state.\n\nChecking the options:\n- $1s^{2}2s^{2}$ and $1s^{2}2p^{2}$ are the fermionic ground-state fillings constrained by Pauli exclusion and are not applicable to bosons.\n- $2s^{4}$ and $1s^{1}2s^{1}2p^{1}3s^{1}$ place particles in higher-energy orbitals unnecessarily.\n- $1s^{4}$ is the bosonic ground state consistent with unlimited occupancy of the lowest orbital.\n\nThus the ground-state configuration is $1s^{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2017174"}, {"introduction": "The Pauli Exclusion Principle is not merely a rule for arranging particles; it has profound energetic consequences.
