This final practice connects theory to a classic chemical example: the conformations of ethane. By analyzing why a horizontal mirror plane, $\\sigma_h$, exists for the eclipsed conformer but not the staggered one, you will see how a molecule's specific three-dimensional geometry directly determines its symmetry elements [@problem_id:1399987].", "problem": "Consider the ethane molecule, $C_2H_6$, which consists of two methyl ($CH_3$) groups connected by a carbon-carbon single bond. Rotation about this bond leads to different conformations. We are interested in two specific cases:\n\n1.  **Eclipsed Conformation**: When viewed along the C-C bond axis, the hydrogen atoms on the front carbon are directly in line with those on the back carbon. The dihedral angle between a C-H bond on the front carbon and the adjacent C-H bond on the back carbon is 0 degrees.\n2.  **Staggered Conformation**: The hydrogen atoms on one carbon atom are rotated by 60 degrees relative to those on the other with respect to the C-C axis. This maximizes the distance between hydrogen atoms on adjacent carbons.\n\nA horizontal mirror plane, denoted as $\\sigma_h$, is a plane of reflection that is perpendicular to the molecule's principal axis of rotation. For ethane, the principal axis is the axis containing the C-C bond. It is a known fact from molecular symmetry that the eclipsed conformation of ethane possesses a $\\sigma_h$ plane, while the staggered conformation does not.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental reason for this difference?\n\nA. In the eclipsed conformation, the perfect alignment of hydrogen atoms on the two carbons means that reflection through a plane bisecting and perpendicular to the C-C bond maps each hydrogen on one carbon onto a hydrogen on the other. In the staggered conformation, this same reflection maps the hydrogens into positions that are not occupied by other atoms due to the 60-degree rotational offset.\n\nB. The staggered conformation contains a center of inversion ($i$) which is mathematically incompatible with the presence of a horizontal mirror plane ($\\sigma_h$). The eclipsed conformation lacks a center of inversion, thus permitting the existence of a $\\sigma_h$ plane.\n\nC. A horizontal mirror plane can only exist if all atoms of the molecule lie within that plane. Neither conformation of ethane is planar, but the eclipsed form is considered to have a $\\sigma_h$ as an approximation because its atoms are closer to being coplanar than in the staggered form.\n\nD. The eclipsed conformation possesses vertical mirror planes ($\\sigma_v$) that contain the C-C bond and also pass through pairs of opposing hydrogen atoms. The existence of these $\\sigma_v$ planes is a necessary prerequisite for a $\\sigma_h$ plane to exist, a condition not met by the staggered conformation.\n\nE. For the eclipsed conformation, a $\\sigma_h$ operation reflects each methyl group into itself. For the staggered conformation, reflection through the same plane maps one methyl group onto the other, but in a rotated orientation that does not match the original molecule, thus violating the symmetry condition.", "solution": "Define the principal axis as the C-C bond; denote it as the $C_{3}$ axis for ethane. A horizontal mirror plane $\\sigma_{h}$ is, by definition, perpendicular to the principal axis and passes through the midpoint between the two carbons. The action of $\\sigma_{h}$ is to reflect any point with cylindrical coordinates $(r,\\phi,z)$ about this plane to $(r,\\phi,-z)$; equivalently, it maps each atom above the plane to the corresponding position below the plane at the same azimuthal angle $\\phi$.\n\nIn the eclipsed conformation, when viewed along the C-C axis, the three hydrogens of the top methyl group and the three hydrogens of the bottom methyl group have identical azimuthal angles $\\phi$ (they are aligned in projection). Under $\\sigma_{h}$, each hydrogen on the top carbon at angle $\\phi$ and height $+z$ is mapped to the position at the same $\\phi$ and height $-z$, where a hydrogen on the bottom carbon resides. The top carbon maps to the bottom carbon, and vice versa. Thus the reflection maps each atom to an identical atom’s position, leaving the molecule indistinguishable from the original. Therefore the eclipsed conformation possesses $\\sigma_{h}$ (its point group is $D_{3h}$).\n\nIn the staggered conformation, the bottom methyl group is rotated by $60^{\\circ}$ relative to the top, so the azimuthal angles differ by $60^{\\circ}$. Under $\\sigma_{h}$, a top hydrogen at $(\\phi,+z)$ maps to $(\\phi,-z)$, but there is no hydrogen there on the bottom methyl; the nearest hydrogens are at $(\\phi\\pm 60^{\\circ},-z)$. Hence $\\sigma_{h}$ alone does not map atoms onto atoms in their actual positions, and the molecule is not invariant under $\\sigma_{h}$. However, the staggered conformation is invariant under an improper rotation $S_{6}$, which combines a $60^{\\circ}$ rotation about the principal axis with a reflection through the plane perpendicular to it; this is why its point group is $D_{3d}$ and includes $S_{6}$ and $i$ but not $\\sigma_{h}$.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A correctly states the mapping criterion for $\\sigma_{h}$: in the eclipsed form, reflection maps each hydrogen onto a counterpart because the azimuthal angles coincide; in the staggered form, the $60^{\\circ}$ offset means the reflected positions are unoccupied, so $\\sigma_{h}$ is absent.\n- B is incorrect because the presence of a center of inversion $i$ is not incompatible with $\\sigma_{h}$; many point groups, such as $D_{nh}$ (e.g., $D_{6h}$), contain both $i$ and $\\sigma_{h}$.\n- C is incorrect because a horizontal mirror plane does not require all atoms to lie in the plane; rather, it requires that reflection maps atoms to identical atoms’ positions, which can be above and below the plane.\n- D is incorrect because the existence of $\\sigma_{v}$ planes is not a necessary prerequisite for $\\sigma_{h}$; for instance, $C_{nh}$ groups possess $\\sigma_{h}$ without $\\sigma_{v}$.\n- E is incorrect in claiming that $\\sigma_{h}$ reflects each methyl group into itself in the eclipsed conformation; $\\sigma_{h}$ exchanges the two methyl groups. While it correctly hints that the staggered form would require an additional $60^{\\circ}$ rotation (i.e., an $S_{6}$ operation), the initial statement is inaccurate and the core reason is more directly and accurately expressed in A.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental reason is given by A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1399987"}]}
