This systematic process is a cornerstone skill for applying group theory to real chemical systems.", "problem": "The allene molecule, with the chemical formula $C_3H_4$, exhibits a unique geometry. Its central carbon atom is sp-hybridized and forms double bonds with two terminal sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. The three carbon atoms are collinear. The two terminal $CH_2$ groups are oriented such that the plane containing one H-C-H group is precisely perpendicular to the plane containing the other H-C-H group. To visualize this, one can place the three carbon atoms along the z-axis with the central carbon at the origin. In this coordinate system, one $CH_2$ group, attached to the carbon at $z > 0$, lies in the yz-plane. The other $CH_2$ group, attached to the carbon at $z < 0$, lies in the xz-plane.\n\nBased on this geometric arrangement, identify the correct Schoenflies notation for the point group of the allene molecule from the options below.\n\nA. $C_{2v}$\n\nB. $C_{2h}$\n\nC. $D_{2h}$\n\nD. $D_{2d}$\n\nE. $T_d$", "solution": "We place the three carbon atoms collinear along the $z$-axis, with the central carbon at the origin, the terminal carbon for $z>0$ carrying a $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ group whose $\\,\\mathrm{H}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}\\,$ plane is the $yz$-plane, and the terminal carbon for $z<0$ carrying a $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ group whose $\\,\\mathrm{H}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}\\,$ plane is the $xz$-plane, as specified.\n\nFirst, identify the principal symmetry about the molecular axis ($z$-axis). A $90^{\\circ}$ rotation about $z$ maps coordinates as $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-y,x,z)$, which sends the top $yz$-plane ($x=0$) into the $xz$-plane ($y=0$) but leaves $z$ unchanged; thus it does not by itself map the molecule onto itself. Composing this rotation with reflection in the plane perpendicular to $z$ (the $xy$-plane), $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(x,y,-z)$, sends the top $yz$-plane at $z>0$ to the bottom $xz$-plane at $z<0$, and likewise the bottom to the top. Therefore, the molecule possesses an $S_{4}$ axis along $z$. As a consequence, $S_{4}^{2}=C_{2}$, so there is a $C_{2}$ rotation about $z$ as well.\n\nNext, identify $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to $z$. Let $u_{1}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,1,0)$ and $u_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,-1,0)$ be unit vectors in the $xy$-plane, orthogonal to each other. A rotation by $180^{\\circ}$ about an axis defined by a unit vector $u$ sends any position vector $r$ to\n$$\nr' \\;=\\; 2(u\\cdot r)\\,u \\;-\\; r.\n$$\nFor a point in the top $yz$-plane, write $r=(0,y,z)$; then with $u=u_{1}$ we have $u\\cdot r=\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and hence $2(u\\cdot r)u=y(1,1,0)$. Therefore,\n$$\nr' \\;=\\; (y,\\,y,\\,0) \\;-\\; (0,\\,y,\\,z) \\;=\\; (y,\\,0,\\,-z),\n$$\nwhich lies in the $xz$-plane at $z<0$, i.e., in the bottom $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ plane. Similarly, points in the bottom $xz$-plane map to the top $yz$-plane. Thus there is a $C_{2}$ axis along $u_{1}$; the same computation with $u_{2}$ shows a second $C_{2}$ axis perpendicular to the first, both perpendicular to $z$.\n\nNow identify mirror planes. Consider reflection across the $xz$-plane, $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(x,-y,z)$. For the bottom $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ group (lying in $y=0$), atoms remain in place. For the top $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ group (lying in the $yz$-plane), this reflection flips $y\\to -y$ within that plane and swaps the two hydrogens (which are identical) while leaving the framework invariant. Therefore the $xz$-plane is a mirror plane. By the same reasoning, the $yz$-plane is also a mirror plane. These are dihedral mirror planes, $\\sigma_{d}$, as they bisect the angle between the two perpendicular $C_{2}$ axes in the $xy$-plane identified above.\n\nFinally, exclude elements not present. Inversion $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-x,-y,-z)$ would map the top $yz$-plane ($x=0$) to the bottom $yz$-plane ($x=0$), but the actual bottom plane is $xz$; hence there is no inversion center. Reflection in the horizontal plane $\\sigma_{h}$ (the $xy$-plane) maps the top $yz$-plane to the bottom $yz$-plane, again not present; thus there is no $\\sigma_{h}$.\n\nCollecting the elements: the molecule has $E$, an $S_{4}$ principal axis (with $S_{4}$ and $S_{4}^{3}$), a $C_{2}$ along $z$ (from $S_{4}^{2}$), two $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to $z$, and two $\\sigma_{d}$ planes.
