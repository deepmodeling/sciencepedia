The absorption of radiation is governed by the molecule's vibrational modes.

For a non-linear molecule, there are three independent rotational degrees of freedom. Therefore, the number of vibrational normal modes is\n$$\n3N - 3 - 3 = 3N - 6.\n$$\n\nFor sulfur hexafluoride, $SF_{6}$, the number of atoms is\n$$\nN = 7.\n$$\nSince $SF_{6}$ is non-linear (it has an octahedral geometry), we apply the non-linear formula:\n$$\n3N - 6 = 3 \\times 7 - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15.\n$$\n\nThus, the total number of normal modes of vibration is $15$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{15}$$", "id": "1995822"}, {"introduction": "Knowing the number of normal modes is only part of the story, as not all vibrations can be observed using infrared (IR) spectroscopy. To predict which modes are \"IR active,\" we must turn to the powerful framework of molecular symmetry and group theory. A vibrational mode is IR active only if it leads to a change in the molecule's net dipole moment, a condition that can be tested rigorously by comparing the symmetry of the vibration with the symmetries of the Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$). This practice [@problem_id:1383986] demonstrates how symmetry acts as a selection rule, enabling us to predict which peaks will appear in a spectrum and assign them to specific molecular motions.", "problem": "Borazine ($B_3N_3H_6$), sometimes referred to as \"inorganic benzene,\" is a planar molecule with $D_{3h}$ symmetry. Its vibrational modes, which describe the various ways the atoms can move relative to each other, can be classified according to the irreducible representations of the $D_{3h}$ point group. Consider a specific degenerate bending vibration in borazine whose associated normal coordinate, $Q_k$, transforms according to the $E''$ irreducible representation of the $D_{3h}$ group.\n\nAn experimentalist wishes to know if this particular vibrational mode can be excited by the absorption of a single photon of Infrared (IR) light. The activity of a vibrational mode in IR spectroscopy is governed by the transition dipole moment integral. For a fundamental transition (from the ground vibrational state with quantum number $\\nu=0$ to the first excited state $\\nu=1$), the mode is IR active if and only if the normal coordinate of the vibration, $Q_k$, transforms under the same irreducible representation as at least one of the components of the electric dipole moment operator, $\\hat{\\mu}$.\n\nFor the $D_{3h}$ point group, the components of the dipole moment operator transform as follows:\n- The component parallel to the principal axis, $\\hat{\\mu}_z$, transforms as the $A_2''$ irreducible representation.\n- The components perpendicular to the principal axis, $(\\hat{\\mu}_x, \\hat{\\mu}_y)$, transform together as the degenerate $E'$ irreducible representation.\n\nBased on this information and group theory principles, determine whether the specified $E''$ bending mode of borazine is IR active and select the correct reasoning.\n\nA. Yes, the mode is IR active because it is a degenerate mode, and all degenerate modes are IR active.\n\nB. No, the mode is IR inactive because it is a bending mode, and only stretching modes can be IR active.\n\nC. No, the mode is IR inactive because its irreducible representation ($E''$) does not match the irreducible representation of any component of the electric dipole moment operator ($A_2''$ or $E'$).\n\nD. Yes, the mode is IR active because the direct product $E'' \\otimes E'$ contains the totally symmetric representation $A_1'$.\n\nE.

Since the ground vibrational state transforms as the totally symmetric representation $A_{1}'$ and the singly excited state of mode $k$ transforms as $\\Gamma(Q_{k})$, the transition is allowed if and only if\n$$\n\\Gamma(\\hat{\\mu})\\otimes \\Gamma(Q_{k}) \\supset A_{1}'.\n$$\n\nFor $D_{3h}$, the dipole components transform as $\\Gamma(\\hat{\\mu}_{z})=A_{2}''$ and $\\Gamma(\\hat{\\mu}_{x},\\hat{\\mu}_{y})=E'$.
