The molecule is designed to be excited by a specific wavelength of light, promoting it from its ground electronic state ($S_0$) to its first excited singlet state ($S_1$). Subsequent experimental characterization reveals that the molecule exhibits very strong, short-lived emission characteristic of fluorescence. However, even when the molecule is placed in a rigid, deoxygenated solvent matrix at cryogenic temperatures, no long-lived emission (phosphorescence) is ever detected.\n\nThe de-excitation of the $S_1$ state can occur through several competing radiative and non-radiative pathways. Consider the following principal photophysical processes:\n\n*   **Absorption:** The process where a molecule absorbs a photon, transitioning to a higher electronic state ($S_0 + h\\nu \\to S_1$).\n*   **Fluorescence:** A radiative process where the molecule relaxes from an excited singlet state to the ground singlet state by emitting a photon ($S_1 \\to S_0 + h\\nu'$). This process conserves spin multiplicity.\n*   **Internal Conversion (IC):** A non-radiative transition between electronic states of the same spin multiplicity (e.g., $S_1 \\to S_0$). The excess energy is dissipated as heat to the surroundings.\n*   **Vibrational Relaxation (VR):** A very fast, non-radiative process where a molecule in an excited vibrational level of an electronic state loses energy and relaxes to the lowest vibrational level of that same electronic state.\n*   **Intersystem Crossing (ISC):** A non-radiative transition between electronic states of different spin multiplicity (e.g., from an excited singlet state to an excited triplet state, $S_1 \\to T_1$).

This state can deactivate through several pathways.\n\nThe key energy levels and kinetic parameters are as follows:\n- The energy of the $S_1(\\pi, \\pi^*)$ state is $E(S_1) = 2.50 \\text{ eV}$.\n- The rate constant for fluorescence ($S_1 \\to S_0$) is $k_f = 1.2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n- The rate constant for internal conversion ($S_1 \\to S_0$) is $k_{IC} = 5.0 \\times 10^7 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n- Two triplet states are energetically accessible for intersystem crossing (ISC) from $S_1$:\n    1.

The quantum yield of a particular photophysical process is the ratio of the rate of that process to the sum of the rates of all deactivation processes from the excited state.\n\nFirst, we must identify all possible deactivation pathways for the $S_1$ state and their corresponding rate constants. The problem states three pathways:\n1.  Fluorescence: $S_1 \\to S_0 + h\\nu$, with rate constant $k_f = 1.2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n2.

Intersystem Crossing (ISC): $S_1 \\to T_k$, with rate constant $k_{ISC}$.\n\nThe total rate of deactivation of the $S_1$ state, $k_{total}$, is the sum of the rates of all these processes:\n$$k_{total} = k_f + k_{IC} + k_{ISC}$$\n\nThe quantum yield of intersystem crossing is then given by:\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} = \\frac{k_{ISC}}{k_{total}} = \\frac{k_{ISC}}{k_f + k_{IC} + k_{ISC}}$$\n\nTo calculate $\\Phi_{ISC}$, we must first determine the value of $k_{ISC}$. There are two possible triplet states, $T_1$ and $T_2$, to which the molecule can cross from $S_1$. We need to determine which pathway is dominant.\n\nThe rate of ISC is proportional to the square of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) matrix element, $|\\langle S_1 | \\hat{H}_{SO} | T_k \\rangle|^2$. Let's examine the two possibilities:\n-   **Path 1: $S_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) \\to T_1(\\pi, \\pi^*)$**\n    The SOC matrix element is given as $|\\langle S_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) | \\hat{H}_{SO} | T_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) \\rangle| = 0.05 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n-   **Path 2: $S_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) \\to T_2(n, \\pi^*)$**\n    The SOC matrix element is given as $|\\langle S_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) | \\hat{H}_{SO} | T_2(n, \\pi^*) \\rangle| = 0.80 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n\nAccording to El-Sayed's rule, spin-orbit coupling, and thus intersystem crossing, is significantly more efficient between states of different electronic orbital character (e.g., $(\\pi, \\pi^*) \\leftrightarrow (n, \\pi^*)$) than between states of the same character (e.g., $(\\pi, \\pi^*) \\leftrightarrow (\\pi, \\pi^*)$). The provided matrix elements reflect this rule, as the value for the $S_1 \\to T_2$ transition ($0.80 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$) is much larger than for the $S_1 \\to T_1$ transition ($0.05 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$).\n\nSince the rate constant $k_{ISC}$ is proportional to the square of this matrix element, the rate of crossing to $T_2$ will be $(0.80/0.05)^2 = 16^2 = 256$ times faster than the rate of crossing to $T_1$. Therefore, the ISC process is overwhelmingly dominated by the $S_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) \\to T_2(n, \\pi^*)$ pathway. We can neglect the contribution from the $S_1 \\to T_1$ pathway and use the matrix element for the $S_1 \\to T_2$ transition to calculate the overall $k_{ISC}$.\n\nNow, we calculate $k_{ISC}$ using the provided formula and the dominant matrix element:\n$$k_{ISC} = C \\times |\\langle S_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) | \\hat{H}_{SO} | T_2(n, \\pi^*) \\rangle|^2$$\nGiven values are $C = 4.0 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ (cm}^{-1})^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1}$ and the matrix element is $0.80 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n$$k_{ISC} = (4.0 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ s}^{-1} \\text{ (cm}^{-1})^{-2}) \\times (0.80 \\text{ cm}^{-1})^2$$\n$$k_{ISC} = (4.0 \\times 10^{10}) \\times (0.64) \\text{ s}^{-1} = 2.56 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\n\nNow we have all the rate constants needed to calculate the quantum yield:\n-   $k_f = 1.2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n-   $k_{IC} = 5.0 \\times 10^7 \\text{ s}^{-1} = 0.5 \\times 10^8 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n-   $k_{ISC} = 2.56 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n\nLet's substitute these into the quantum yield formula:\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} = \\frac{k_{ISC}}{k_f + k_{IC} + k_{ISC}}$$\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} = \\frac{2.56 \\times 10^{10}}{1.2 \\times 10^8 + 5.0 \\times 10^7 + 2.56 \\times 10^{10}}$$\nTo simplify the sum in the denominator, let's express all terms with a common power of 10.\n$$k_f + k_{IC} = 1.2 \\times 10^8 + 0.5 \\times 10^8 = 1.7 \\times 10^8 \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} = \\frac{2.56 \\times 10^{10}}{1.7 \\times 10^8 + 2.56 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2.56 \\times 10^{10}}{0.017 \\times 10^{10} + 2.56 \\times 10^{10}}$$\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} = \\frac{2.56 \\times 10^{10}}{(0.017 + 2.56) \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2.56}{2.577}$$\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} \\approx 0.993399...$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} = 0.993$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.993}$$", "id": "1376725"}]}
