{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before we can explore a potential energy surface (PES), we must first understand its dimensions. A PES maps energy as a function of all possible geometric arrangements of a molecule's atoms, and its dimensionality is defined by the number of independent internal coordinates required to specify that geometry. This first exercise provides a foundational skill: calculating the number of vibrational degrees of freedom, which directly corresponds to the dimensionality of the PES for a given molecule [@problem_id:1388018].", "problem": "In the field of computational chemistry, a Potential Energy Surface (PES) provides a fundamental landscape for understanding chemical reactions and molecular properties. A researcher is modelling the process of ethylene polymerization and needs to perform a full geometry optimization of a single ethene molecule ($C_2H_4$) as a starting point. To uniquely define the molecule's geometry irrespective of its overall position and orientation in three-dimensional space, a set of internal coordinates (such as bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles) is used. The number of these independent internal coordinates corresponds to the number of vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule.\n\nDetermine the total number of independent internal coordinates required to completely describe the geometry of the ethene molecule, $C_2H_4$. Assume the molecule is non-linear.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of independent internal coordinates required to completely describe the geometry of the ethene molecule, $C_2H_4$. This quantity is equivalent to the number of vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total number of degrees of freedom for the molecule. For a molecule consisting of $N$ atoms, each atom can move in three independent directions (x, y, z). Therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom is $3N$.\nThe ethene molecule, $C_2H_4$, consists of 2 Carbon atoms and 4 Hydrogen atoms.\nSo, the total number of atoms is $N = 2 + 4 = 6$.\nThe total degrees of freedom for ethene is $3N = 3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n\nThese total degrees of freedom are partitioned into translational, rotational, and vibrational motions.\nAny molecule moving in three-dimensional space has 3 translational degrees of freedom, which describe the motion of the molecule's center of mass.\n\nThe number of rotational degrees of freedom depends on the geometry of the molecule.\n- For a linear molecule (where all atoms lie on a single straight line), there are 2 rotational degrees of freedom.\n- For a non-linear molecule, there are 3 rotational degrees of freedom.\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the ethene molecule should be treated as non-linear. Ethene has a planar structure but its atoms do not all lie on a single axis, confirming it is non-linear. Therefore, it has 3 rotational degrees of freedom.\n\nThe remaining degrees of freedom are vibrational, which correspond to the internal coordinates (changes in bond lengths, angles, etc.) that define the molecule's geometry. The number of vibrational degrees of freedom can be calculated by subtracting the translational and rotational degrees of freedom from the total degrees of freedom.\n\nNumber of internal coordinates = (Total degrees of freedom) - (Translational degrees of freedom) - (Rotational degrees of freedom)\n\nFor a non-linear molecule, this formula is:\nNumber of internal coordinates = $3N - 3 - 3 = 3N - 6$.\n\nNow, we substitute the value of $N=6$ into this formula:\nNumber of internal coordinates = $3(6) - 6$\nNumber of internal coordinates = $18 - 6$\nNumber of internal coordinates = $12$.\n\nThus, 12 independent internal coordinates are required to completely describe the geometry of the ethene molecule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "1388018"}, {"introduction": "Once we have a map of the PES, we can extract chemically meaningful information from its topography. The 'valleys' on this surface correspond to stable species like reactants and products, while the 'mountain passes' between them represent transition states.
