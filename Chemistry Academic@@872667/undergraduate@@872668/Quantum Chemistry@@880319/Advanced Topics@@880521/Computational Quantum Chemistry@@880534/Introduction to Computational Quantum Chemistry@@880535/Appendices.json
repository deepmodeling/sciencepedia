They are evaluating three possible combinations of quantum chemical methods and basis sets, which are commonly denoted in the `Method/BasisSet` format. The three calculations are:\n\n1.  **Calculation A**: Hartree-Fock / STO-3G\n2.  **Calculation B**: Hartree-Fock / 6-31G(d)\n3.  **Calculation C**: Møller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order / 6-31G(d)\n\nTo plan their work efficiently, the student must first estimate the relative computational cost of these calculations. The cost is known to scale polynomially with the number of basis functions, $N$, used to represent the molecule's orbitals. This scaling relationship is typically expressed as $O(N^k)$, where the exponent $k$ is determined by the chosen method.\n\nYou are provided with the following established principles of computational chemistry:\n-   The Hartree-Fock (HF) method, which approximates the many-electron wavefunction as a single Slater determinant, has a computational cost that scales approximately as $O(N^4)$.\n-   Møller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order (MP2), a method that improves upon HF by including electron correlation effects, has a computational cost that scales approximately as $O(N^5)$.\n-   The STO-3G (Slater-Type Orbital mimicked by 3 Gaussian functions) is a minimal basis set.\n-   The 6-31G(d) basis set is a split-valence basis set that includes a set of polarization functions (denoted by 'd'). For any given molecule, the 6-31G(d) basis set is significantly larger and more flexible than the STO-3G basis set, resulting in a substantially greater number of basis functions, $N$.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following options correctly ranks the three calculations from **least computationally expensive** to **most computationally expensive**?\n\nA. A < B < C\n\nB. A < C < B\n\nC. B < A < C\n\nD. C < B < A\n\nE. B < C < A", "solution": "We denote by $N$ the number of basis functions used in a calculation. The asymptotic computational cost is expressed as $O(N^{k})$, where $k$ depends on the electronic structure method.\n\nFrom the given principles:\n- Hartree-Fock (HF) scales as $O(N^{4})$.\n- MP2 scales as $O(N^{5})$.\n- For a fixed molecule, the STO-3G basis is minimal, so it uses fewer basis functions than the 6-31G(d) basis. Therefore, if $N_{\\text{STO-3G}}$ and $N_{\\text{6-31G(d)}}$ denote the basis sizes for the methane molecule, then $N_{\\text{STO-3G}}<N_{\\text{6-31G(d)}}$.\n\nLabel the three calculations’ basis sizes by $N_{A}$, $N_{B}$, and $N_{C}$, and their methods by their respective exponents:\n- Calculation A: HF/STO-3G, so cost $O(N_{A}^{4})$ with $N_{A}=N_{\\text{STO-3G}}$.\n- Calculation B: HF/6-31G(d), so cost $O(N_{B}^{4})$ with $N_{B}=N_{\\text{6-31G(d)}}$.\n- Calculation C: MP2/6-31G(d), so cost $O(N_{C}^{5})$ with $N_{C}=N_{\\text{6-31G(d)}}$.\n\nBecause B and C use the same basis on the same molecule, $N_{B}=N_{C}=N_{\\text{6-31G(d)}}$, and since 6-31G(d) is larger than STO-3G, $N_{B}=N_{C}>N_{A}$.\n\nNow compare costs:\n1. Between A and B: both are HF with exponent $4$, and $N_{B}>N_{A}$ implies $N_{B}^{4}>N_{A}^{4}$, hence $O(N_{B}^{4})>O(N_{A}^{4})$. Therefore, A is less expensive than B.\n2. Between B and C: both use the same $N$ but with different exponents; with $N_{B}=N_{C}>1$, we have $N_{C}^{5}>N_{B}^{4}$, so $O(N_{C}^{5})>O(N_{B}^{4})$. Therefore, B is less expensive than C.\n\nCombining these, the overall ordering from least to most expensive is A $<$ B $<$ C, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1375393"}, {"introduction": "The use of finite basis sets in quantum chemistry, while practical, introduces subtle errors that are not based in physics.
