A time series of Oscillin concentration, recorded as a sequence of discrete measurements $x_i$ where $i=1, 2, ..., N$, exhibits complex, aperiodic fluctuations. The researcher wants to determine if these fluctuations are due to deterministic chaos in the underlying biochemical reaction network or if they are the result of a linear stochastic process (i.e., correlated noise).\n\nTo distinguish between these two possibilities, a technique called surrogate data analysis is employed. The null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that the experimental time series is generated by a stationary linear Gaussian process. This process is fully characterized by its power spectrum. The analysis proceeds as follows:\n\n1. A large number of surrogate time series are generated. Each surrogate is designed to have the exact same power spectrum as the original experimental data but with randomized Fourier phases. This is achieved by taking the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the original data, randomizing the phase of each frequency component, and then performing an inverse DFT. This procedure effectively destroys any nonlinear correlations present in the original data while preserving all linear properties (like the autocorrelation function).\n\n2. A discriminating statistic, which is sensitive to nonlinearity, is calculated for both the original time series and for each of the surrogate time series. For this analysis, a 'Temporal Asymmetry Coefficient', $\\gamma$, is used, defined as:\n   $$ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{(N-1) \\sigma^3} \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (x_{i+1} - x_i)^3 $$\n   where $N$ is the number of data points and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the time series $\\{x_i\\}$.\n\n3.
