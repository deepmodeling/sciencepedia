The cobalt reaction is slow because the electron transfer involves a change in the occupancy of $\\sigma$-antibonding ($e_g$) orbitals, leading to a large structural reorganization. The ruthenium reaction is fast because the electron is transferred between non-bonding ($t_{2g}$) orbitals, resulting in minimal structural change.\n\nB.

The ruthenium reaction is fast because both Ru(II) and Ru(III) complexes are low-spin, creating a low-energy pathway. The cobalt reaction is slow because it involves a conversion from a high-spin Co(II) to a low-spin Co(III) complex.\n\nD. The difference in rate is due to the different ligand field strengths. Ammine ($NH_3$) acts as a weak-field ligand for Co(II) but a strong-field ligand for Ru(II), causing the disparity in electronic structure.\n\nE.

The problem states that solvent reorganization is comparable for both systems, so the observed rate difference must arise primarily from differences in $\\lambda_{i}$ and, secondarily, from any systematic differences in $|H_{AB}|$.\n\nThe inner-sphere reorganization energy $\\lambda_{i}$ increases with the magnitude of structural changes (notably metal–ligand bond length changes) along the electron transfer coordinate. In an octahedral field, the $e_{g}$ set is $\\sigma$-antibonding with respect to metal–ligand bonds, whereas the $t_{2g}$ set is nonbonding with respect to the $\\sigma$ framework. Therefore, changes in $e_{g}$ occupancy cause large bond length changes and hence a large $\\lambda_{i}$, while changes confined to $t_{2g}$ occupancy cause much smaller structural changes and thus a smaller $\\lambda_{i}$.\n\nNow consider electron configurations:\n- For cobalt ammines:\n  - $[Co(NH_{3})_{6}]^{2+}$ is high-spin $d^{7}$ in an octahedral field: $t_{2g}^{5}e_{g}^{2}$.\n  - $[Co(NH_{3})_{6}]^{3+}$ is low-spin $d^{6}$: $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}$.\n  The self-exchange thus interconverts a species with two $e_{g}$ electrons and one with zero $e_{g}$ electrons. Because $e_{g}$ orbitals are $\\sigma$-antibonding, this implies a large change in metal–ligand bond lengths between the two oxidation states, yielding a large $\\lambda_{i}$ and, by the exponential dependence on $\\lambda$, a very small $k$.\n\n- For ruthenium ammines (second-row, large splitting, typically low-spin):\n  - $[Ru(NH_{3})_{6}]^{2+}$ is low-spin $d^{6}$: $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}$.\n  - $[Ru(NH_{3})_{6}]^{3+}$ is low-spin $d^{5}$: $t_{2g}^{5}e_{g}^{0}$.\n  The self-exchange changes only the $t_{2g}$ occupancy while keeping $e_{g}$ occupancy at zero on both sides. Because $t_{2g}$ is nonbonding with respect to the $\\sigma$ framework, metal–ligand bond lengths change minimally, giving a small $\\lambda_{i}$ and hence a much larger $k$.\n\nGiven the comparable $\\lambda_{s}$ and that the dominant difference is whether the electron transfer changes $e_{g}$ occupancy ($\\sigma$-antibonding) or remains within $t_{2g}$ (nonbonding), the decisive factor is the inner-sphere reorganization energy driven by $e_{g}$ versus $t_{2g}$ occupancy changes.
