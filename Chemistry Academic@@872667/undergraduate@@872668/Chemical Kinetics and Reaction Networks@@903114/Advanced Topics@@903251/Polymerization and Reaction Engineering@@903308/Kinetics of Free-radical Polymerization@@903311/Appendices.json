The reaction is initiated by the thermal decomposition of an initiator, $I$. The elementary steps of the process are as follows:\n\n1.  **Initiation:** The initiator $I$ decomposes with a rate constant $k_d$ to form two primary radicals. Each primary radical then reacts with a monomer molecule to start a polymer chain. The efficiency of this initiation process is given by a factor $f$, which represents the fraction of primary radicals that successfully initiate a chain. The overall rate of initiation, $R_i$, is given by $R_i = 2fk_d[I]$.\n\n2.  **Propagation:** A growing polymer chain with an active radical end, denoted $M^\\bullet$, reacts with a monomer $M$ to extend the chain. This step has a rate constant $k_p$. The rate of propagation is given by $R_p = k_p[M][M^\\bullet]$, where $[M^\\bullet]$ is the total concentration of all radical-terminated polymer chains.\n\n3.  **Termination:** Two growing polymer chains react and terminate, ending their growth. This bimolecular termination step has a rate constant $k_t$. The rate of termination, which is the rate at which radicals are consumed, is given by $R_t = 2k_t[M^\\bullet]^2$.\n\nThe kinetic chain length, $\\nu$, is defined as the ratio of the rate of propagation to the rate of initiation. This quantity is directly proportional to the average molecular weight of the polymer formed.\n\nFor a particular synthesis, the chemist wants to maintain a constant kinetic chain length to ensure product consistency. In a standard batch, the initial monomer concentration is $[M]_1$ and the initial initiator concentration is $[I]_1$. In a subsequent experimental batch, the initial monomer concentration is increased to $[M]_2 = 1.35 [M]_1$. To compensate for this change and keep the kinetic chain length the same as in the standard batch, the initial initiator concentration is adjusted to a new value, $[I]_2$.\n\nAssuming the concentration of radical intermediates, $[M^\\bullet]$, reaches a steady state, determine the factor by which the initial initiator concentration must be changed.
