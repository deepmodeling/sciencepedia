While space time is a convenient parameter based on inlet conditions, the actual time a molecule spends in the reactor can differ significantly when fluid properties like density change, a common scenario in gas-phase reactions ([@problem_id:1510278]). Working through this hypothetical scenario illuminates the physical reality that can underlie our idealized models and sharpens your understanding of flow dynamics.", "problem": "An inert, ideal gas flows steadily through a long, heated tube of total internal volume $V$. The flow pattern can be modeled as that of a Plug Flow Reactor (PFR). The gas enters the tube at a volumetric flow rate of $v_0$ and a density of $\\rho_0$. Due to heating, the gas expands as it travels through the tube, and the pressure is maintained constant throughout. The density of the gas at the tube's outlet is exactly half of its inlet density, i.e., $\\rho_{out} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0$. The heating is applied in such a way that the gas temperature increases linearly with the cumulative volume traversed from the inlet.\n\nThe space time, $\\tau$, for this system is defined based on inlet conditions as $\\tau = V/v_0$.

The space time is given by the definition:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{V}{v_0} $$\nwhere $V$ is the total reactor volume and $v_0$ is the inlet volumetric flow rate.\n\nThe mean residence time, $\\bar{t}$, is the time it takes for an average fluid particle to pass through the reactor. For a Plug Flow Reactor (PFR), we can calculate this by integrating the time required to traverse each infinitesimal volume element $dV'$ along the reactor length. The time $dt$ to traverse a volume element $dV'$ is given by:\n$$ dt = \\frac{dV'}{v(V')} $$\nwhere $v(V')$ is the local volumetric flow rate at the position corresponding to cumulative volume $V'$. The mean residence time is the integral of $dt$ over the entire reactor volume:\n$$ \\bar{t} = \\int_0^V \\frac{dV'}{v(V')} $$\nThe mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}$, must be constant throughout the tube due to the principle of mass conservation for a steady-state flow.

This means that density is inversely proportional to temperature: $\\rho \\propto \\frac{1}{T}$.\nThe ratio of densities can be expressed as a ratio of temperatures:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho(V')}{\\rho_0} = \\frac{T_0}{T(V')} $$\nwhere $T_0$ is the inlet temperature and $T(V')$ is the local temperature. The problem states that the temperature increases linearly with the cumulative volume $V'$ from the inlet.
