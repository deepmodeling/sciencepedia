The process involves an initiator, $I$, and a monomer, $M$. The kinetics of the polymerization are described by the following three steps:\n\n1.  **Initiation**: The initiator decomposes to form primary radicals, which then react with a monomer to start a polymer chain. The overall rate of formation of active polymer chains, $R_i$, is given by $R_i = 2 f k_d [I]$, where $k_d$ is the rate constant for initiator decomposition and $f$ is the initiator efficiency factor.\n2.  **Propagation**: An active polymer chain radical, $M_n^\\bullet$, reacts with a monomer molecule to extend the chain: $M_n^\\bullet + M \\xrightarrow{k_p} M_{n+1}^\\bullet$. The overall rate of polymerization, $R_p$, which is defined as the rate of consumption of the monomer, is given by $R_p = k_p [M] [M^\\bullet_{tot}]$, where $[M^\\bullet_{tot}]$ is the total concentration of all active polymer radicals.\n3.  **Termination**: Two active polymer chains terminate exclusively by combination to form a single inactive polymer molecule: $M_n^\\bullet + M_m^\\bullet \\xrightarrow{k_t} P_{n+m}$.
