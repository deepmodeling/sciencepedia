These pathways are:\n\n1.  **Fluorescence:** The molecule radiatively decays back to the ground electronic state. This process is characterized by a first-order rate constant $k_f$.\n2.  **Intersystem Crossing (ISC):** The molecule undergoes a non-radiative transition to a triplet electronic state, $T_1$. This process is characterized by a first-order rate constant $k_{isc}$.\n3.  **Pre-dissociation:** The potential energy surface of the excited singlet state, $S_1$, intersects with the potential energy surface of an unbound, repulsive electronic state.

Consider a model system for such a drug, molecule `A`. Upon absorption of a photon, molecule `A` is promoted to its first excited singlet electronic state, $S_1$. From the $S_1$ state, the molecule has two competing relaxation pathways. The first pathway involves all non-dissociative processes (such as fluorescence and internal conversion back to the ground state), which occur with a combined first-order rate constant $k_0$. The second pathway is pre-dissociation, where the molecule undergoes a transition to a repulsive triplet state, $T_1$, leading to immediate bond cleavage. This pre-dissociation step is a forbidden spin transition, made possible by Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC), and occurs with a rate constant $k_{pd,A}$.\n\nTo enhance the drug's efficiency, a synthetic chemist creates a derivative, molecule `B`. Molecule `B` is structurally identical to `A`, except that a key atom with atomic number $Z_A$ in the vicinity of the dissociating bond has been replaced by a much heavier atom with atomic number $Z_B$.
