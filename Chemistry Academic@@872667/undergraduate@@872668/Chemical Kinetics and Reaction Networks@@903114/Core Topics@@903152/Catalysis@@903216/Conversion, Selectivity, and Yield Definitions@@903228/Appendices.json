The problem asks for the answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures. Our calculated value, $0.700$, already meets this requirement.\n\nFor context, it is useful to note that aniline is the excess reactant in this batch. The limiting reactant can be found by comparing the stoichiometric requirement. To react all $2.50$ moles of phthaloyl chloride (A), we would need $2.50 \\times 2 = 5.00$ moles of aniline (B). Since we started with $6.00$ moles of aniline, phthaloyl chloride is the limiting reactant.
