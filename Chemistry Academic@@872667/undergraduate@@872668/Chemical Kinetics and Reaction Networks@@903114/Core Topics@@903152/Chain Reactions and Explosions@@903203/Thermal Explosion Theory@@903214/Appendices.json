This practice problem uses the Frank-Kamenetskii model to explore how geometry directly affects thermal stability.

The thermal stability of this material is analyzed using the Frank-Kamenetskii theory of thermal explosion. According to this model, a spontaneous thermal explosion occurs if the dimensionless Frank-Kamenetskii parameter, $\\delta$, exceeds a geometry-dependent critical value, $\\delta_c$.\n\nThe Frank-Kamenetskii parameter is defined as:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{E_a q A r^2}{\\lambda R T_a^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T_a}\\right) $$\nwhere $E_a$ is the activation energy of the decomposition reaction, $q$ is the heat of reaction per unit volume, $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $r$ is the characteristic dimension of the reactant mass, $\\lambda$ is its thermal conductivity, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T_a$ is the constant ambient temperature of the surroundings.\n\nThe critical value, $\\delta_c$, depends on the shape of the reactant pile.

The critical condition for a thermal explosion is reached when the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter, $\\delta$, equals its critical value, $\\delta_c$.\n\nThe Frank-Kamenetskii parameter is given by the expression:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{E_a q A r^2}{\\lambda R T_a^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T_a}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that the material properties ($E_a, q, A, \\lambda$) and the ambient temperature ($T_a$) are identical for both scenarios. The universal gas constant $R$ is also a constant. Therefore, we can group all these constant terms into a single constant, $K$.\nLet's define $K$ as:\n$$ K = \\frac{E_a q A}{\\lambda R T_a^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T_a}\\right) $$\nThe expression for $\\delta$ can then be simplified to:\n$$ \\delta = K r^2 $$\nThis equation shows that for a given material and ambient temperature, the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter is directly proportional to the square of its characteristic dimension, $r$.\n\nThe critical condition for explosion occurs when the characteristic dimension reaches its maximum safe value, which we denote as $r_c$. At this point, $\\delta = \\delta_c$. We can write this critical condition for both the slab and the cylinder.\n\nFor the infinite slab, the characteristic dimension is its half-thickness, $r_c, \\text{slab}$. The critical condition is:\n$$ \\delta_{c, \\text{slab}} = K (r_{c, \\text{slab}})^2 $$\n\nFor the infinite cylinder, the characteristic dimension is its radius, $r_c, \\text{cylinder}$. The critical condition is:\n$$ \\delta_{c, \\text{cylinder}} = K (r_{c, \\text{cylinder}})^2 $$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $\\frac{r_{c, \\text{cylinder}}}{r_{c, \\text{slab}}}$. To do this, we can first rearrange the two equations above to solve for $r_c^2$:\n$$ (r_{c, \\text{slab}})^2 = \\frac{\\delta_{c, \\text{slab}}}{K} $$\n$$ (r_{c, \\text{cylinder}})^2 = \\frac{\\delta_{c, \\text{cylinder}}}{K} $$\n\nNow, we can take the ratio of these two expressions:\n$$ \\frac{(r_{c, \\text{cylinder}})^2}{(r_{c, \\text{slab}})^2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\delta_{c, \\text{cylinder}}}{K}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\delta_{c, \\text{slab}}}{K}\\right)} $$\nThe constant $K$ cancels out, leaving:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{r_{c, \\text{cylinder}}}{r_{c, \\text{slab}}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\delta_{c, \\text{cylinder}}}{\\delta_{c, \\text{slab}}} $$\n\nTo find the desired ratio, we take the square root of both sides:\n$$ \\frac{r_{c, \\text{cylinder}}}{r_{c, \\text{slab}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta_{c, \\text{cylinder}}}{\\delta_{c, \\text{slab}}}} $$\nThe problem provides the numerical values for the critical parameters: $\\delta_{c, \\text{slab}} = 0.878$ and $\\delta_{c, \\text{cylinder}} = 2.00$. Substituting these values into our equation:\n$$ \\frac{r_{c, \\text{cylinder}}}{r_{c, \\text{slab}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.00}{0.878}} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$ \\frac{r_{c, \\text{cylinder}}}{r_{c, \\text{slab}}} = \\sqrt{2.277904...} \\approx 1.509272... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{r_{c, \\text{cylinder}}}{r_{c, \\text{slab}}} \\approx 1.51 $$\nPhysically, this means that a cylindrical shape can have a larger characteristic radius than a slab's half-thickness before becoming unstable. This is because for a given characteristic dimension $r$, a cylinder has a more favorable surface-area-to-volume ratio for heat dissipation than a slab, allowing it to remain stable at larger sizes under the same conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.51}$$", "id": "1526269"}, {"introduction": "Scientific models often begin with simplifying assumptions that make a problem tractable.
