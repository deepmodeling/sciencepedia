A key step in this process is creating an active site that can specifically bind a target substrate. Consider a hypothetical design project where the substrate is 3-phenylpropanoate. The enzyme is intended to operate in a cellular environment with a physiological pH of 7.4.\n\nThe 3-phenylpropanoate molecule consists of a nonpolar phenyl group attached to a three-carbon chain that terminates in a carboxylate group. For effective binding within the enzyme's active site, non-covalent interactions must be established with both the phenyl and carboxylate moieties of the substrate.\n\nFrom the list below, which pair of amino acid residues would be most suitable to position within the active site to achieve the strongest and most specific binding to the 3-phenylpropanoate substrate?\n\nA. Serine and Glutamate\n\nB. Phenylalanine and Lysine\n\nC. Valine and Isoleucine\n\nD. Aspartate and Glutamate", "solution": "We identify the substrate features and match them with complementary non-covalent interactions available from amino acid side chains under physiological conditions.\n\nAt $pH=7.4$, the carboxylic acid terminus of 3-phenylpropanoate will be deprotonated because $pH>pK_{a}(\\text{carboxyl})$, yielding a negatively charged carboxylate. The phenyl ring is nonpolar and aromatic, favoring hydrophobic contacts and $\\pi$-based interactions. Therefore, the active site should provide:\n1) An aromatic or suitably hydrophobic residue to engage the phenyl ring via hydrophobic and $\\pi$ interactions.\n2) A positively charged residue to form a strong electrostatic (salt bridge) and potential hydrogen-bonding interaction with the carboxylate.\n\nAmong standard amino acids at $pH=7.4$, lysine is protonated (side chain $\\mathrm{NH_{3}^{+}}$) and thus can form a favorable salt bridge with the carboxylate, while phenylalanine provides an aromatic surface for hydrophobic and $\\pi$ interactions with the phenyl group.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A. Serine and Glutamate: Serine is polar uncharged and not optimal for strong binding to the phenyl ring; glutamate is negatively charged and would electrostatically repel the carboxylate.\n- B. Phenylalanine and Lysine: Phenylalanine can engage the phenyl ring through hydrophobic and $\\pi$ interactions; lysine provides a positively charged group to form a salt bridge with the carboxylate. This pair achieves both required complementarities.\n- C. Valine and Isoleucine: Both are hydrophobic and may contact the phenyl ring, but they lack a positive charge to complement the carboxylate, reducing specificity and strength.\n- D. Aspartate and Glutamate: Both negatively charged; they would repel the carboxylate and offer no aromatic surface for the phenyl ring.\n\nThus, the most suitable pair is phenylalanine and lysine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1483688"}, {"introduction": "The formation of the enzyme-substrate complex is a dynamic equilibrium, not a static event, and understanding this equilibrium quantitatively is key to predicting enzyme behavior.
