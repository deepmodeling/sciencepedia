The data is then fitted to the Hill equation:\n\n$$Y = \\frac{[S]^{n_H}}{K_A + [S]^{n_H}}$$\n\nHere, $Y$ is the fraction of occupied binding sites, $[S]$ is the free substrate concentration, $K_A$ is a constant related to the substrate concentration that yields half-maximal saturation, and $n_H$ is the Hill coefficient, which provides a measure of cooperativity. The best fit to their experimental data yields a Hill coefficient of $n_H = 0.75$.\n\nBased on this experimental finding, which of the following statements provides the most accurate physical description of the substrate binding process for this enzyme?\n\nA.

In MWC, such effectors modify the conformational equilibrium by changing the effective allosteric constant $L$, without altering the substrate dissociation constants $K_{R}$ and $K_{T}$, so $c=K_{R}/K_{T}$ remains unchanged.\n\nFirst, evaluate the effect on $V_{max}$. Consider the high-substrate limit $\\alpha\\to\\infty$:\n$$(1+\\alpha)^{n}\\sim \\alpha^{n},\\quad (1+c\\alpha)^{n}\\sim (c\\alpha)^{n}=c^{n}\\alpha^{n},$$\n$$\\alpha(1+\\alpha)^{n-1}\\sim \\alpha^{n},\\quad \\alpha(1+c\\alpha)^{n-1}\\sim c^{n-1}\\alpha^{n}.$$\nHence,\n$$Y \\xrightarrow[\\alpha\\to\\infty]{} \\frac{\\alpha^{n}+L c^{n}\\alpha^{n}}{\\alpha^{n}+L c^{n}\\alpha^{n}}=1.$$\nTherefore, $v\\xrightarrow[\\alpha\\to\\infty]{} V_{max}$ independent of $L$ and $c$.

We determine how $Y$ varies with $L$ at fixed $\\alpha$ and $c$. Differentiate $Y$ with respect to $L$.

Therefore, $K_{0.5}$ increases with $L$, and decreases when $L$ decreases.\n\nFinally, connect this to the effectors. In MWC, an activator that binds only the R state multiplies the statistical weight of the R state by a factor dependent on its occupancy, effectively reducing $L$ to an $L'$ of the form\n$$L'=\\frac{L}{(1+a_{A})^{m_{A}}},\\quad a_{A}=\\frac{[A]}{K_{A}^{R}},$$\nwith $m_{A}$ the number of activator-binding sites. At saturating $[A]$, $a_{A}$ is large and $L'$ is reduced, which decreases $K_{0.5}$; $V_{max}$ remains unchanged as shown above. Conversely, an inhibitor that binds only the T state increases the T-state weight, yielding\n$$L' = L(1+a_{I})^{m_{I}},\\quad a_{I}=\\frac{[I]}{K_{I}^{T}},$$\nwhich increases $L$ at saturating $[I]$, thereby increasing $K_{0.5}$; again $V_{max}$ is unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the activator decreases $K_{0.5}$ without affecting $V_{max}$, and the inhibitor increases $K_{0.5}$ without affecting $V_{max}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1471798"}]}
