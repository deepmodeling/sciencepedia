The reaction mechanism is given as $A \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_{1}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} I \\stackrel{k_{2}}{\\longrightarrow} P$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the potential energy surface described by the given activation energies. The activation energy is the energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to occur.\n- The formation of the intermediate $I$ from reactant $A$ has a relatively high activation energy, $E_{a,1} = 55.0$ kJ/mol. This means the forward rate constant, $k_1$, will be relatively small.\n- The intermediate $I$ can be consumed in two ways: it can revert to the reactant $A$ or proceed to form the product $P$.\n- The activation energy for $I$ to revert to $A$ is $E_{a,-1} = 5.0$ kJ/mol.\n- The activation energy for $I$ to convert to $P$ is $E_{a,2} = 3.0$ kJ/mol.\n\nThe energy barriers for the consumption of the intermediate ($E_{a,-1}$ and $E_{a,2}$) are both very small compared to the barrier for its formation ($E_{a,1}$). This describes a scenario where the intermediate $I$ exists in a very shallow potential energy well. Once formed, it can very quickly react, either by returning to $A$ or by proceeding to $P$. A species that reacts very quickly is, by definition, highly reactive and has a very short lifetime.\n\nThe lifetime ($\\tau$) of an intermediate is inversely related to the sum of the rate constants of the pathways that consume it. In this case, the consumption pathways have rate constants $k_{-1}$ and $k_2$. Thus, the lifetime of $I$ can be approximated as $\\tau_I \\approx \\frac{1}{k_{-1} + k_2}$.\nAccording to the Arrhenius equation, $k = A \\exp(-E_a / RT)$, a smaller activation energy $E_a$ leads to a larger rate constant $k$. Since both $E_{a,-1}$ and $E_{a,2}$ are very small, the rate constants $k_{-1}$ and $k_2$ will be very large. Consequently, their sum $(k_{-1} + k_2)$ will be a large number, making the lifetime $\\tau_I$ very short.\n\nNext, let's analyze the concentration of the intermediate. Since the intermediate is highly reactive and has a very short lifetime, we can apply the Steady-State Approximation (SSA). The SSA posits that for a very reactive intermediate, its concentration remains low and nearly constant after an initial build-up period. This is because it is consumed as quickly as it is formed. Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\frac{d[I]}{dt} \\approx 0$.\n\nThe rate of formation of $I$ is given by the forward reaction from $A$:\nRate of formation = $k_1 [A]$\n\nThe rate of consumption of $I$ is the sum of the rates of the two pathways that consume it:\nRate of consumption = $k_{-1}[I] + k_2[I] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[I]$\n\nApplying the SSA, we set the rate of formation equal to the rate of consumption:\n$k_1 [A] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[I]$\n\nWe can solve for the steady-state concentration of the intermediate, $[I]_{ss}$:\n$$[I]_{ss} = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1} + k_2} [A]$$\n\nNow we examine the ratio of rate constants, $\\frac{k_1}{k_{-1} + k_2}$.\n- The rate constant $k_1$ corresponds to a high activation energy ($E_{a,1} = 55.0$ kJ/mol), so $k_1$ is small.\n- The rate constants $k_{-1}$ and $k_2$ correspond to very low activation energies ($E_{a,-1} = 5.0$ kJ/mol and $E_{a,2} = 3.0$ kJ/mol), so $k_{-1}$ and $k_2$ are both large. Their sum, $(k_{-1} + k_2)$, is therefore very large.\n\nThe ratio of a small number ($k_1$) to a very large number ($k_{-1} + k_2$) is a very small number.\n$$[I]_{ss} = (\\text{very small number}) \\times [A]$$\nThis means that the steady-state concentration of the intermediate $I$ will be a very small fraction of the reactant concentration $[A]$. Therefore, the intermediate will have a very low steady-state concentration.\n\nCombining our findings, the intermediate $I$ is characterized by both a very short lifetime and a very low steady-state concentration.
