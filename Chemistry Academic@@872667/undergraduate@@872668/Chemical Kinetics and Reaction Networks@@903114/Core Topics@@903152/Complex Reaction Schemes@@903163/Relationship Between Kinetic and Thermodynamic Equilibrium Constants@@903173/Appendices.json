For the first step, detailed balance at equilibrium would require $k_{1}[A][B]=k_{-1}[C]$. For the second step, detailed balance would require a reverse rate $k_{-2}[D]$ such that $k_{2}[C]=k_{-2}[D]$. However, in the given mechanism the transformation $C \\rightarrow D$ is irreversible; there is no reverse step and no $k_{-2}$. Therefore, the only way to have $\\frac{d[D]}{dt}=k_{2}[C]=0$ is to have $[C]=0$.\n\nImposing stationarity on $C$ with $[C]=0$ in $\\frac{d[C]}{dt}=k_{1}[A][B]-(k_{-1}+k_{2})[C]$ gives $k_{1}[A][B]=0$, which implies either $[A]=0$ or $[B]=0$. Thus, the only stationary states of the given irreversible scheme have one of the reactants depleted and $[C]=0$, with $D$ simply accumulated. There is no nontrivial state in which $A$, $B$, and $D$ coexist at fixed, time-independent concentrations connected by a thermodynamic equilibrium relation. Consequently, it is not meaningful to define a thermodynamic equilibrium constant for an overall process $A+B \\rightleftharpoons D$ in this irreversible scheme.\n\nThis directly rules out the possibility of an overall equilibrium constant depending on $k_{2}$, such as $K_{eq}=\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}}$; beyond the lack of thermodynamic meaning, that expression is also not an equilibrium constant but a kinetic composite parameter (it has the units of a second-order rate constant when $k_{2} \\ll k_{-1}$ is used for pre-equilibrium kinetics). The rapid pre-equilibrium assumption $k_{2} \\ll k_{-1}$ allows one to write $[C]=\\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}[A][B]$ and hence $\\frac{d[D]}{dt}=k_{2}[C]=\\left(\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}}\\right)[A][B]$, but this constructs a kinetic rate law, not a thermodynamic equilibrium between $A+B$ and $D$. The steady-state approximation similarly yields kinetic expressions for rates or intermediates, not a thermodynamic equilibrium constant for $A+B \\rightleftharpoons D$.\n\nFinally, the mere presence of an intermediate does not preclude defining an overall equilibrium constant; if all steps were reversible, an overall thermodynamic equilibrium constant could be defined consistently with microscopic reversibility. Here it is specifically the irreversibility of $C \\rightarrow D$ that prevents a thermodynamic equilibrium for the overall process.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental assessment is that the suggested overall thermodynamic equilibrium constant is inapplicable because the system as posed does not reach thermodynamic equilibrium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1508985"}]}
