The reaction is determined to be an elementary process described by the stoichiometry:\n$$2A + B \\rightleftharpoons 3C$$\nLet $k_f$ be the forward rate constant and $k_r$ be the reverse rate constant. After allowing the system to reach equilibrium in a closed reactor at a constant temperature, experimental measurements of the partial pressures are taken. These measurements reveal that the equilibrium partial pressure of species $A$ is twice the equilibrium partial pressure of species $B$, and the equilibrium partial pressure of species $C$ is four times the equilibrium partial pressure of species $B$.\n\nThe principle of detailed balance states that at equilibrium, the rate of every elementary process is equal to the rate of its reverse process.

The rate of the forward reaction depends on the concentrations (or partial pressures) of the reactants, and the rate of the reverse reaction depends on the concentrations (or partial pressures) of the products. Let $P_A$, $P_B$, and $P_C$ represent the partial pressures of species A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nThe forward rate law is:\n$$R_f = k_f P_A^2 P_B$$\nThe reverse rate law is:\n$$R_r = k_r P_C^3$$\n\nAt equilibrium, we equate these two rates. Let the subscript 'eq' denote equilibrium partial pressures.\n$$k_f (P_{A,eq})^2 P_{B,eq} = k_r (P_{C,eq})^3$$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $\\frac{k_f}{k_r}$. We can rearrange the equation above to solve for this ratio:\n$$\\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{(P_{C,eq})^3}{(P_{A,eq})^2 P_{B,eq}}$$\nThis ratio is also known as the equilibrium constant expressed in terms of partial pressures, $K_p$.\n\nNext, we use the specific relationships between the equilibrium partial pressures given in the problem statement.\n1. The partial pressure of species $A$ is twice that of species $B$: $P_{A,eq} = 2 P_{B,eq}$.\n2. The partial pressure of species $C$ is four times that of species $B$: $P_{C,eq} = 4 P_{B,eq}$.\n\nTo simplify the calculation, let's introduce a variable $p$ to represent the equilibrium partial pressure of species $B$, so $P_{B,eq} = p$.\nUsing this, we can express the other equilibrium partial pressures in terms of $p$:\n$$P_{A,eq} = 2p$$\n$$P_{C,eq} = 4p$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into our equation for the ratio of the rate constants:\n$$\\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{(4p)^3}{(2p)^2 (p)}$$\n\nLet's simplify the expression by evaluating the powers:\n$$\\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{64p^3}{(4p^2)(p)}$$\n\nNow, combine the terms in the denominator:\n$$\\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{64p^3}{4p^3}$$\n\nFinally, we cancel the $p^3$ term from the numerator and the denominator and perform the division:\n$$\\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{64}{4} = 16$$\n\nThus, the numerical value of the ratio of the forward rate constant to the reverse rate constant is 16.

The student's conclusion is flawed. Their observation describes a steady state for the intermediate, but this is not sufficient for equilibrium. Thermodynamic equilibrium requires the more stringent condition of detailed balance, where the forward and reverse rates of *each individual elementary step* must be equal.\n\nB. The student's conclusion is correct. When the concentration of all intermediates in a reaction mechanism is constant, the system is by definition at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nC. The student's conclusion is flawed because at equilibrium, not only must the concentration of the intermediate be constant, but the rate constants for all forward reactions must equal the rate constants for all reverse reactions (i.e., $k_1=k_{-1}$ and $k_2=k_{-2}$).\n\nD. The student's conclusion is flawed because their observation only implies that the net flux into the intermediate pool is zero. For true equilibrium, the net flux from the overall reactant A to the overall product B must be zero, a condition which is independent of the rates involving the intermediate I.\n\nE.

Option D focuses only on the overall net flux from A to B; while zero overall flux is necessary at equilibrium, the fundamental equilibrium criterion for an elementary mechanism is detailed balance for each step. Option E introduces isolation versus closed conditions; the flaw in the conclusion does not hinge on that distinction.
