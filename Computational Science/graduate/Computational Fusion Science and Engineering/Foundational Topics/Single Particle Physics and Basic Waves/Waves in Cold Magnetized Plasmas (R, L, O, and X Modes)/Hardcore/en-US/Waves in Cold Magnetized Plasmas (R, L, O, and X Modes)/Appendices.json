            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It presents a standard problem in plasma physics involving the derivation of wave dispersion relations and related properties in a cold, magnetized plasma. All necessary physical principles, equations, and definitions are provided. The assumptions, such as treating ions as an immobile background for the given frequency range, are standard and justified. The problem is valid.\n\nWe begin by considering small-amplitude, time-harmonic plane waves, where all perturbed quantities vary proportionally to $\\exp[i(\\boldsymbol{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{r} - \\omega t)]$. Under this assumption, the differential operators transform as $\\nabla \\rightarrow i\\boldsymbol{k}$ and $\\partial/\\partial t \\rightarrow -i\\omega$.\n\nMaxwell's equations in Fourier space become:\n$$i\\boldsymbol{k} \\times \\boldsymbol{E} = i\\omega \\boldsymbol{B}$$\n$$i\\boldsymbol{k} \\times \\boldsymbol{B} = \\mu_{0} \\boldsymbol{J} - i\\omega \\mu_{0} \\varepsilon_{0} \\boldsymbol{E}$$\n\nThe linearized cold-fluid electron momentum equation is:\n$$-i\\omega m_{e} \\boldsymbol{v}_{e} = -e \\left( \\boldsymbol{E} + \\boldsymbol{v}_{e} \\times \\boldsymbol{B}_{0} \\right)$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{v}_{e}$ is the perturbed electron fluid velocity. The current density is given by $\\boldsymbol{J} = -n_{e} e \\boldsymbol{v}_{e}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the dispersion relation for the ordinary (O) mode. This mode is defined by perpendicular propagation, $\\boldsymbol{k} \\perp \\boldsymbol{B}_{0}$, and parallel electric field polarization, $\\boldsymbol{E} \\parallel \\boldsymbol{B}_{0}$. Let us set up a coordinate system with the background magnetic field along the z-axis, $\\boldsymbol{B}_{0} = B_{0} \\hat{z}$, and the wavevector along the x-axis, $\\boldsymbol{k} = k \\hat{x}$. The O-mode polarization condition implies $\\boldsymbol{E} = E_{z} \\hat{z}$.\n\nWith this configuration, the electron momentum equation is analyzed. The Lorentz force term is $\\boldsymbol{v}_{e} \\times \\boldsymbol{B}_{0}$. As $\\boldsymbol{E}$ is entirely in the z-direction, it can only accelerate electrons in that direction. Thus, the resulting electron velocity perturbation $\\boldsymbol{v}_{e}$ will also be in the z-direction, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{v}_{e} = v_{ez} \\hat{z}$. Consequently, the magnetic force term $\\boldsymbol{v}_{e} \\times \\boldsymbol{B}_{0} = (v_{ez} \\hat{z}) \\times (B_{0} \\hat{z}) = 0$. The magnetic field has no effect on the electron motion for this specific polarization. The momentum equation simplifies to:\n$$-i\\omega m_{e} v_{ez} \\hat{z} = -e E_{z} \\hat{z}$$\nSolving for the electron velocity, we get:\n$$v_{ez} = \\frac{e E_{z}}{i\\omega m_{e}} = -\\frac{i e E_{z}}{\\omega m_{e}}$$\nThe current density is then:\n$$\\boldsymbol{J} = -n_{e} e (v_{ez} \\hat{z}) = -n_{e} e \\left(-\\frac{i e E_{z}}{\\omega m_{e}}\\right) \\hat{z} = \\frac{i n_{e} e^{2}}{\\omega m_{e}} \\boldsymbol{E}$$\nUsing the definition of the electron plasma frequency, $\\omega_{pe}^{2} = n_{e} e^{2}/(\\varepsilon_{0} m_{e})$, we can write the current density as:\n$$\\boldsymbol{J} = \\frac{i \\varepsilon_{0} \\omega_{pe}^{2}}{\\omega} \\boldsymbol{E}$$\nTo find the dispersion relation, we substitute the current into the wave equation derived from Maxwell's curl equations. From $i\\boldsymbol{k} \\times \\boldsymbol{E} = i\\omega \\boldsymbol{B}$, we get $\\boldsymbol{B} = \\frac{1}{\\omega} (\\boldsymbol{k} \\times \\boldsymbol{E})$. Substituting this into $i\\boldsymbol{k} \\times \\boldsymbol{B} = \\mu_0 \\boldsymbol{J} - i\\frac{\\omega}{c^2}\\boldsymbol{E}$ gives:\n$$i\\boldsymbol{k} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega} (\\boldsymbol{k} \\times \\boldsymbol{E})\\right) = \\mu_0 \\boldsymbol{J} - i\\frac{\\omega}{c^2}\\boldsymbol{E}$$\nFor the O-mode, $\\boldsymbol{k} \\perp \\boldsymbol{E}$, so $\\boldsymbol{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{E} = 0$. The vector identity for the triple cross product simplifies the left-hand side to $\\frac{i}{\\omega}(-k^2\\boldsymbol{E})$. Substituting the expression for $\\boldsymbol{J}$ gives:\n$$\\frac{i}{\\omega}(-k^2\\boldsymbol{E}) = \\mu_0\\left(\\frac{i\\varepsilon_0\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega}\\boldsymbol{E}\\right) - i\\frac{\\omega}{c^2}\\boldsymbol{E}$$\nDividing by $i\\boldsymbol{E}/\\omega$:\n$$-k^2 = \\mu_0\\varepsilon_0\\omega_{pe}^2 - \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} = \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{c^2} - \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}$$\nThus, the dispersion relation is:\n$$k^{2}c^{2} = \\omega^{2} - \\omega_{pe}^{2}$$\nThis relation shows that for $\\omega < \\omega_{pe}$, the wave number squared $k^{2}$ is negative, implying that $k$ is purely imaginary. Let $k = i\\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is the attenuation constant.\n$$(i\\kappa)^{2}c^{2} = -\\kappa^{2}c^{2} = \\omega^{2} - \\omega_{pe}^{2}$$\n$$\\kappa^{2} = \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^{2} - \\omega^{2}}{c^{2}}$$\nSince $\\kappa$ must be real and positive for wave decay, we have $\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\omega_{pe}^{2} - \\omega^{2}}/c$. The wave amplitude decays as $\\exp(-\\kappa x)$. The skin depth $\\delta_{O}$ is the distance over which the amplitude attenuates by a factor of $1/e$, so $\\delta_{O} = 1/\\kappa$.\n$$\\delta_{O}(\\omega) = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{\\omega_{pe}^{2} - \\omega^{2}}}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the case of parallel propagation, $\\boldsymbol{k} \\parallel \\boldsymbol{B}_{0}$, for transverse waves ($\\boldsymbol{E} \\perp \\boldsymbol{k}$). We set $\\boldsymbol{B}_{0} = B_{0} \\hat{z}$ and $\\boldsymbol{k} = k \\hat{z}$. The electric field $\\boldsymbol{E}$ lies in the xy-plane. The electron velocity $\\boldsymbol{v}_{e}$ will also be in the xy-plane. The momentum equation is $m_{e}(-i\\omega\\boldsymbol{v}_{e}) = -e(\\boldsymbol{E} + \\boldsymbol{v}_{e} \\times B_0\\hat{z})$. We decompose this into circular polarizations by defining $E_{\\pm} = E_{x} \\pm iE_{y}$ and $v_{\\pm} = v_{ex} \\pm iv_{ey}$. The momentum equation yields two decoupled equations for these circular components:\n$$m_e(-i\\omega)v_{\\pm} = -e E_{\\pm} \\mp ieB_{0}v_{\\pm}$$\n$$-i(\\omega \\mp \\Omega_{e})m_{e}v_{\\pm} = -eE_{\\pm}$$\nwhere $\\Omega_{e} = eB_{0}/m_{e}$ is the electron cyclotron frequency. The '+' sign corresponds to the left-hand (L) polarized mode and the '-' sign to the right-hand (R) polarized mode. The velocity is $v_{\\pm} = \\frac{eE_{\\pm}}{i m_{e}(\\omega \\mp \\Omega_{e})}$. The current density components are $J_{\\pm} = -n_{e}ev_{\\pm} = \\frac{-n_{e}e^{2}E_{\\pm}}{im_{e}(\\omega \\mp \\Omega_{e})} = \\frac{i\\varepsilon_{0}\\omega_{pe}^{2}}{\\omega \\mp \\Omega_{e}} E_{\\pm}$.\nThe wave equation for transverse waves is $k^{2}\\boldsymbol{E} = \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{c^{2}}\\boldsymbol{E} - i\\omega\\mu_{0}\\boldsymbol{J}$. Applying this to the polarized components:\n$$k^{2}E_{\\pm} = \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{c^{2}}E_{\\pm} - i\\omega\\mu_{0}\\left(\\frac{i\\varepsilon_{0}\\omega_{pe}^{2}}{\\omega \\mp \\Omega_{e}} E_{\\pm}\\right)$$\n$$k^{2} = \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{c^{2}} - \\frac{\\omega\\mu_{0}\\varepsilon_{0}\\omega_{pe}^{2}}{\\omega \\mp \\Omega_{e}} = \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{c^{2}} - \\frac{\\omega\\omega_{pe}^{2}}{c^{2}(\\omega \\mp \\Omega_{e})}$$\nThe dispersion relations for the R and L modes are:\n$$k^{2}c^{2} = \\omega^{2} - \\frac{\\omega\\omega_{pe}^{2}}{\\omega \\mp \\Omega_{e}}$$\nA cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ is defined by the condition $k=0$ (for $\\omega \\neq 0$). Setting $k=0$ gives:\n$$\\omega^{2} = \\frac{\\omega\\omega_{pe}^{2}}{\\omega \\mp \\Omega_{e}} \\implies \\omega(\\omega \\mp \\Omega_{e}) = \\omega_{pe}^{2}$$\n$$\\omega^{2} \\mp \\omega\\Omega_{e} - \\omega_{pe}^{2} = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the cutoff frequencies.\nFor the R-mode (upper sign): $\\omega^{2} - \\omega\\Omega_{e} - \\omega_{pe}^{2} = 0$. The positive frequency solution is:\n$$\\omega_{c,R} = \\frac{\\Omega_{e} + \\sqrt{\\Omega_{e}^{2} + 4\\omega_{pe}^{2}}}{2}$$\nFor the L-mode (lower sign): $\\omega^{2} + \\omega\\Omega_{e} - \\omega_{pe}^{2} = 0$. The positive frequency solution is:\n$$\\omega_{c,L} = \\frac{-\\Omega_{e} + \\sqrt{\\Omega_{e}^{2} + 4\\omega_{pe}^{2}}}{2}$$\n\nThe physical reason for the different cutoff behaviors is as follows. For the ordinary mode ($\\boldsymbol{E} \\parallel \\boldsymbol{B}_0$), the electrons are accelerated parallel to the magnetic field. The magnetic part of the Lorentz force, $-e(\\boldsymbol{v}_e \\times \\boldsymbol{B}_0)$, is zero because $\\boldsymbol{v}_e \\parallel \\boldsymbol{B}_0$. The electrons respond as if in an unmagnetized plasma. The only characteristic frequency governing the collective electron response is the plasma frequency $\\omega_{pe}$, which becomes the sole cutoff frequency.\nFor parallel propagation ($\\boldsymbol{k} \\parallel \\boldsymbol{B}_0$), the wave electric field is transverse to $\\boldsymbol{B}_0$ and drives electrons to move in the plane perpendicular to $\\boldsymbol{B}_0$. This motion results in a non-zero magnetic force $-e(\\boldsymbol{v}_e \\times \\boldsymbol{B}_0)$, which causes the electrons to gyrate at the cyclotron frequency $\\Omega_e$. The wave-particle interaction is sensitive to the relationship between the wave's polarization (direction of E-field rotation) and the electrons' natural gyration direction. The R-mode's field rotates in the same sense as the electrons, leading to a resonant interaction at $\\omega=\\Omega_e$. The L-mode's field rotates opposite to the electron gyration. Because the plasma's response is different for each sense of rotation, the dielectric properties differ for the R and L modes, leading to two distinct dispersion relations and two distinct cutoff frequencies, $\\omega_{c,R}$ and $\\omega_{c,L}$, which depend on both $\\omega_{pe}$ and $\\Omega_{e}$.",

It is a standard, solvable problem in the study of wave propagation in magnetized plasmas.\n\nWe begin by deriving the dielectric response of the cold, magnetized plasma. The starting point is the linearized momentum equation for an electron fluid in the frequency domain, assuming a time dependence of $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$:\n$$ -i\\omega m_{e} \\mathbf{v}(\\omega) = -e \\left( \\mathbf{E}(\\omega) + \\mathbf{v}(\\omega) \\times \\mathbf{B}_{0} \\right) $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{v}$ is the electron fluid velocity, $\\mathbf{E}$ is the wave electric field, $\\mathbf{B}_{0} = B_{0} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ is the static magnetic field, $m_e$ is the electron mass, and $-e$ is the electron charge.

The equations for $v_x$ and $v_z$ can be written in matrix form:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} -i\\omega m_e & eB_0 \\\\ -eB_0 & -i\\omega m_e \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_z \\end{pmatrix} = -e \\begin{pmatrix} E_x \\\\ E_z \\end{pmatrix} $$\nInverting the matrix yields:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_z \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{-e}{m_e^2 (\\Omega_{ce}^2 - \\omega^2)} \\begin{pmatrix} -i\\omega m_e & -eB_0 \\\\ eB_0 & -i\\omega m_e \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} E_x \\\\ E_z \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{e}{m_e(\\omega^2 - \\Omega_{ce}^2)} \\begin{pmatrix} i\\omega E_x - \\Omega_{ce} E_z \\\\ \\Omega_{ce} E_x + i\\omega E_z \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWith $\\mathbf v$ known, the plasma current density $\\mathbf{J} = -n_{0} e \\mathbf{v}$ can be related to the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ via the conductivity tensor $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$: $\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}$.

The wave equation derived from Maxwell's equations is $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) - \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0$. In Fourier space, assuming a wave form $\\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r} - i\\omega t)$, this becomes $\\mathbf{k} \\times (\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{E}) + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0$.\nThe problem specifies propagation perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}_0$, so the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ is in the $x$-$z$ plane, $\\mathbf{k} = k_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The wave equation becomes a matrix equation $(\\mathbf{k}\\mathbf{k}^T - k^2\\mathbf{I} + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}\\mathbf{K})\\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0$.\nWriting this out in components:\n$$ (k_x^2 - k^2 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} K_{xx})E_x + (\\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} K_{xz})E_z + k_x k_z E_z = 0 $$\n$$ (-k^2 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} K_{yy})E_y = 0 $$\n$$ (\\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} K_{zx})E_x + (k_z^2 - k^2 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} K_{zz})E_z + k_x k_z E_x = 0 $$\nThe equation for $E_y$ is decoupled from the equations for $E_x$ and $E_z$. This means there are two independent sets of modes. One mode has its electric field polarized entirely in the $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ direction (so $E_x=E_z=0$), parallel to the static magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_0$. This is the ordinary (O) mode. The incident wave has s-polarization, meaning its electric field $\\mathbf{E}_i$ is parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. By the linearity of the system and the boundary conditions (continuity of tangential $\\mathbf{E}$), only the O-mode will be excited in the plasma.\nThe dispersion relation for this O-mode is given by the condition for a non-trivial solution for $E_y$:\n$$ -k^2 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} K_{yy} = 0 \\implies k^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2} \\right) $$\nThis dispersion relation is identical to that of a wave in an unmagnetized plasma, which is expected since the electron motion for this mode is parallel to $\\mathbf{B}_0$, so the Lorentz force term $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}_0$ vanishes.\n\nNow we derive the reflection coefficient $r_s$. The incident, reflected, and transmitted waves are:\nIncident ($z<0$): $\\mathbf{E}_i = E_{i0} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\exp[i(k_{ix}x + k_{iz}z - \\omega t)]$\nReflected ($z<0$): $\\mathbf{E}_r = r_s E_{i0} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\exp[i(k_{rx}x + k_{rz}z - \\omega t)]$\nTransmitted ($z>0$): $\\mathbf{E}_t = t_s E_{i0} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\exp[i(k_{tx}x + k_{tz}z - \\omega t)]$\n\nIn vacuum ($z<0$), the wavevector magnitude is $k_0 = \\omega/c$. The components are:\n$k_{ix} = k_0 \\sin\\theta_i$, $k_{iz} = k_0 \\cos\\theta_i$\n$k_{rx} = k_0 \\sin\\theta_i$, $k_{rz} = -k_0 \\cos\\theta_i$\n\nPhase matching at the interface $z=0$ requires the tangential component of the wavevector to be continuous: $k_{ix} = k_{rx} = k_{tx}$. So, $k_{tx} = k_0 \\sin\\theta_i$.\nThe normal component of the transmitted wavevector, $k_{tz}$, is found from the O-mode dispersion relation: $k_{tx}^2 + k_{tz}^2 = k^2 = k_0^2 (1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2})$.\n$$ k_{tz}^2 = k_0^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2}\\right) - k_{tx}^2 = k_0^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2}\\right) - (k_0 \\sin\\theta_i)^2 = k_0^2 \\left(1 - \\sin^2\\theta_i - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2}\\right) $$\n$$ k_{tz}^2 = k_0^2 \\left(\\cos^2\\theta_i - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2}\\right) $$\nThe problem condition $\\sin^2\\theta_i < 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2}$ ensures that $\\cos^2\\theta_i - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2} > 0$, so $k_{tz}$ is real. We choose the positive root for a wave propagating into the plasma ($+z$ direction):\n$$ k_{tz} = k_0 \\sqrt{\\cos^2\\theta_i - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2}} = \\frac{\\omega}{c}\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\theta_i - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2}} $$\nThe electromagnetic boundary conditions at $z=0$ are continuity of the tangential components of $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{H}$.\n1. Continuity of tangential $\\mathbf{E}$ (parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$):\n$E_{i0} + r_s E_{i0} = t_s E_{i0} \\implies 1 + r_s = t_s$.\n\n2.

A monochromatic plane wave of angular frequency $\\omega$ is incident from vacuum at $x < 0$ into the plasma, with the wavevector lying in the $x$–$z$ plane. The incidence angle relative to $\\mathbf{B}_0$ is $\\theta$, so that the parallel refractive index is $N_{\\parallel} = \\sin\\theta$, where $N_{\\parallel} \\equiv k_{\\parallel} c/\\omega$ and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. The plasma density varies only along $x$ with a monotonic gradient; near the relevant mode conversion layers, the density is well approximated by a local linear profile such that the electron plasma frequency squared varies as $\\omega_{pe}^2(x)$ with a constant gradient $g \\equiv d\\omega_{pe}^2/dx > 0$. Define the local density gradient length at a reference point $x_\\ast$ by $L_n \\equiv \\omega_{pe}^2(x_\\ast)/|d\\omega_{pe}^2/dx|$ and assume $L_n$ is specified at the left-hand cutoff of the extraordinary mode.\n\nThe cold plasma dielectric response is characterized by the Stix parameters $S$, $D$, $P$, and the right- and left-handed parameters $R$ and $L$, defined in terms of $\\omega$, the electron cyclotron frequency $\\omega_{ce}$, and $\\omega_{pe}^2(x)$ as\n$$\nP = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2},\\quad\nR = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega(\\omega + \\omega_{ce})},\\quad\nL = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega(\\omega - \\omega_{ce})},\\quad\nS = \\frac{R + L}{2},\\quad\nD = \\frac{R - L}{2}.\n$$\n\nYou will develop a computational model for the two-step conversion of externally launched electromagnetic waves into electron Bernstein waves (EBWs) via ordinary-to-extraordinary (O–X) mode conversion followed by extraordinary-to-Bernstein (X–B) conversion at the upper-hybrid resonance. Work entirely in the cold plasma framework for the electromagnetic part and model the X–B step as evanescent tunneling from the left-hand cutoff to the upper-hybrid resonance (where $S=0$), which is sufficient to determine the access of the extraordinary wave to the resonance layer. Use the following fundamental bases only: Maxwell’s equations in a cold plasma and the cold dielectric tensor, the dispersion relations that follow for the ordinary and extraordinary modes, and one-dimensional Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) tunneling for a classically forbidden region.\n\nYour program must, for each test case, compute the following three quantities:\n\n1. The O–X conversion efficiency coefficient $C_{OX}$, obtained by asymptotic reduction of the coupled-wave problem near the O-mode cutoff into a two-mode Budden system with a linear density gradient. Treat the oblique incidence via the conserved parallel refractive index $N_{\\parallel}$ assumed constant across the narrow conversion layer. The algorithm must start from the cold plasma dispersion and the identification of the ordinary and slow extraordinary branches near their interaction, use linearization in $x$ of the relevant dispersion functions, and conclude with a closed-form expression for $C_{OX}$ in terms of $\\omega$, $\\omega_{ce}$, $L_n$, and $N_{\\parallel}$.\n\n2. The X–B tunneling factor $T_{XB}$, modeled as a one-dimensional WKB transmission coefficient across the evanescent region between the left-hand cutoff (where $L=0$) and the upper-hybrid resonance (where $S=0$) for the extraordinary mode at effectively perpendicular propagation. Using the perpendicular extraordinary-mode refractive index\n$$\nn_{\\perp,X}^2 = \\frac{R L}{S},\n$$\ndefine the local evanescent wavenumber $\\kappa(x) = k_0 \\sqrt{-n_{\\perp,X}^2(x)}$ with $k_0 = \\omega/c$ inside the barrier where $n_{\\perp,X}^2 < 0$. The WKB transmission is then\n$$\nT_{XB} = \\exp\\!\\left(-2 \\int_{x_L}^{x_{UH}} \\kappa(x)\\, dx \\right),\n$$\nwhere $x_L$ and $x_{UH}$ are the positions where $L=0$ and $S=0$, respectively. Use the linear relation $\\omega_{pe}^2(x) = \\omega_{pe}^2(x_L) + g (x - x_L)$ with $g = \\omega_{pe}^2(x_L)/L_n$ to express the integral in terms of $\\omega_{pe}^2$ and evaluate it numerically in a stable manner.\n\n3. The total O–X–B EBW access efficiency\n$$\nC_{\\text{tot}} = C_{OX} \\times T_{XB}.\n$$\n\nAdopt the following physical constants in SI units: electron charge $e$, electron mass $m_e$, vacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_0$, and speed of light $c$. All inputs are in SI units. Angles must be interpreted in degrees. If the upper-hybrid resonance is not present (e.g., $\\omega \\le \\omega_{ce}$) then define $T_{XB} = 0$. If the O–X step is absent by symmetry (e.g., $N_{\\parallel}=0$) then $C_{OX}$ must reflect that and $C_{\\text{tot}}$ should reduce accordingly. All outputs for $C_{OX}$, $T_{XB}$, and $C_{\\text{tot}}$ are dimensionless and must lie in the closed interval $[0,1]$.\n\nYour program must implement the above for the following test suite of cases, and report only the three values $C_{\\text{tot}}$ rounded to three decimal places, in a single-line aggregated format as specified below. The plasma parameters for the test suite are:\n\n- Case A (near-optimal O–X, moderate gradient): $B_0 = 1.0$ T, $f = 56.0\\times 10^9$ Hz, $L_n = 2.0\\times 10^{-2}$ m, $\\theta = 35.26438968$ degrees.\n- Case B (detuned O–X, gentle gradient): $B_0 = 1.0$ T, $f = 56.0\\times 10^9$ Hz, $L_n = 1.0\\times 10^{-1}$ m, $\\theta = 45.0$ degrees.\n- Case C (no O–X by symmetry, moderate gradient): $B_0 = 1.0$ T, $f = 56.0\\times 10^9$ Hz, $L_n = 2.0\\times 10^{-2}$ m, $\\theta = 0.0$ degrees.\n\nNumerical and physical details:\n\n- For conversion between frequency $f$ and angular frequency use $\\omega = 2\\pi f$.\n- Use the electron cyclotron frequency $\\omega_{ce} = e B_0 / m_e$.\n- For the X–B tunneling integral, treat the barrier between the roots of $L(\\omega,\\omega_{ce},\\omega_{pe}^2)=0$ and $S(\\omega,\\omega_{ce},\\omega_{pe}^2)=0$. Evaluate the integral accurately despite the integrable square-root singularity at the upper-hybrid endpoint.\n- Express the final outputs as dimensionless floats rounded to three decimal places.\n\nFinal output format requirement: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the three cases, i.e., $[C_{\\text{tot}}^{(A)}, C_{\\text{tot}}^{(B)}, C_{\\text{tot}}^{(C)}]$, each rounded to three decimal places (for example, $[0.842,0.003,0.000]$).",
            "solution": "This solution first derives the analytical expressions for the two main quantities, the O-X conversion efficiency $C_{OX}$ and the X-B tunneling factor $T_{XB}$, based on the models specified. These expressions are then implemented computationally.\n\n### Fundamental Parameters\n\nFirst, we define the fundamental physical constants and derive the key plasma parameters from the inputs.\n- Speed of light in vacuum: $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}$\n- Electron charge magnitude: $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C}$\n- Electron mass: $m_e = 9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg}$\n\nGiven an external magnetic field $B_0$ and wave frequency $f$, we calculate:\n- Angular frequency: $\\omega = 2\\pi f$\n- Electron cyclotron frequency: $\\omega_{ce} = e B_0 / m_e$\n- Normalized cyclotron frequency: $Y_c = \\omega_{ce} / \\omega$\n- Vacuum wavenumber: $k_0 = \\omega / c$\n\nFor an incidence angle $\\theta$ with respect to the magnetic field, the parallel refractive index is conserved:\n- Parallel refractive index: $N_{\\parallel} = \\sin\\theta$\n\n### 1. O-X Conversion Efficiency ($C_{OX}$)\n\nThe problem states that the O-X conversion should be modeled using a two-mode Budden system near the O-mode cutoff, which occurs where the electron plasma frequency $\\omega_{pe}$ equals the wave frequency $\\omega$. In a cold plasma, for oblique incidence ($N_{\\parallel} \\neq 0$), efficient mode conversion is possible within a narrow window of incidence angles centered around an optimal value, $N_{\\parallel,opt}$. This is known as the Preinhaelter-Kopecký-Mjolhus effect.\n\nThe optimal parallel refractive index is given by:\n$$ N_{\\parallel,opt}^2 = \\frac{Y_c}{1+Y_c} $$\nFor deviations from this optimal angle, the conversion efficiency decreases. A well-established result based on a parabolic approximation of the dispersion relation near the mode-conversion point gives a Gaussian-like transmission coefficient. We adopt this model for $C_{OX}$:\n$$ C_{OX} = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{\\pi}{2} (k_0 L_{n,O})^2 (N_\\parallel - N_{\\parallel,opt})^2 \\right) $$\nwhere $N_{\\parallel,opt} = \\sqrt{Y_c / (1+Y_c)}$. The parameter $L_{n,O}$ is the density gradient scale length evaluated at the O-mode cutoff ($\\omega_{pe}^2 = \\omega^2$). The problem provides the scale length $L_n$ at the left-hand cutoff of the extraordinary mode ($\\omega_{pe}^2(x_L) = \\omega(\\omega-\\omega_{ce})$). Assuming a constant gradient $g = d\\omega_{pe}^2/dx$, we can relate the two scale lengths:\n$$ g = \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2(x_L)}{L_n} = \\frac{\\omega(\\omega - \\omega_{ce})}{L_n} = \\frac{\\omega^2(1-Y_c)}{L_n} $$\nThe scale length at the O-mode cutoff is then:\n$$ L_{n,O} = \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2(x_O)}{g} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{g} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega^2(1-Y_c)/L_n} = \\frac{L_n}{1-Y_c} $$\nThis formula correctly predicts $C_{OX}=1$ for optimal incidence ($N_\\parallel = N_{\\parallel,opt}$) and a rapid decrease in efficiency away from this angle. For parallel incidence ($N_\\parallel=0$), the O and X modes are decoupled, and the conversion efficiency is exactly zero.\n\n### 2. X-B Tunneling Factor ($T_{XB}$)\n\nThe problem instructs to model the extraordinary-to-Bernstein wave conversion (X-B) as a WKB tunneling problem. The extraordinary (X) mode must tunnel through an evanescent region to reach the upper-hybrid resonance (UHR), where the conversion to the electron Bernstein wave (EBW) occurs.\n\nThe evanescent region is bounded by the left-hand (L) cutoff and the UHR. These are defined by the roots of the Stix parameters $L$ and $S$:\n- L-cutoff ($x_L$): $L = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega(\\omega-\\omega_{ce})} = 0 \\implies \\omega_{pe}^2(x_L) = \\omega(\\omega-\\omega_{ce})$\n- UHR ($x_{UH}$): $S = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2-\\omega_{ce}^2} = 0 \\implies \\omega_{pe}^2(x_{UH}) = \\omega^2 - \\omega_{ce}^2$\n\nThis tunneling scenario is possible only if the UHR exists at a higher density than the L-cutoff, which requires $\\omega > \\omega_{ce}$ (or $Y_c < 1$). If $Y_c \\ge 1$, the UHR is not accessible from the low-density side, and we set $T_{XB}=0$ as per the instructions.\n\nThe WKB tunneling factor is given by:\n$$ T_{XB} = \\exp(-\\Gamma_{XB}) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\Gamma_{XB} = 2 \\int_{x_L}^{x_{UH}} \\kappa(x) \\, dx $$\nThe local evanescent wavenumber $\\kappa(x)$ is defined using the perpendicular refractive index for the X-mode, $n_{\\perp,X}^2 = RL/S$:\n$$ \\kappa(x) = k_0 \\sqrt{-n_{\\perp,X}^2(x)} = k_0\\sqrt{-\\frac{R(x)L(x)}{S(x)}} $$\nTo evaluate the integral, we change the integration variable to the normalized density $X = \\omega_{pe}^2(x)/\\omega^2$. Using $dx = d(\\omega_{pe}^2)/g = (\\omega^2/g)dX = L_{n,O} dX$, the integral for the exponent becomes:\n$$ \\Gamma_{XB} = 2 k_0 L_{n,O} \\int_{X_L}^{X_{UH}} \\sqrt{-\\frac{R(X)L(X)}{S(X)}} \\, dX $$\nThe integration limits in terms of $X$ are $X_L = 1-Y_c$ and $X_{UH} = 1-Y_c^2$. The Stix parameters are functions of $X$ and $Y_c$:\n$$ R(X) = 1 - \\frac{X}{1+Y_c}, \\quad L(X) = 1 - \\frac{X}{1-Y_c}, \\quad S(X) = 1 - \\frac{X}{1-Y_c^2} $$\nSubstituting these gives the integral to be computed numerically:\n$$ \\Gamma_{XB} = 2 k_0 \\frac{L_n}{1-Y_c} \\int_{1-Y_c}^{1-Y_c^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{(1+Y_c-X)(X-(1-Y_c))}{1-Y_c^2-X}} \\, dX $$\nThe integrand has an integrable square-root singularity at the upper limit ($X=X_{UH}$), which can be handled by standard numerical quadrature routines.\n\n### 3. Total O-X-B Efficiency ($C_{\\text{tot}}$)\n\nThe total efficiency for the two-step conversion process is the product of the efficiencies of the individual steps:\n$$ C_{\\text{tot}} = C_{OX} \\times T_{XB} $$\nThis represents the fraction of power from the incident O-mode that is successfully converted and accesses the UHR layer. The algorithm will compute this value for each test case and format the output as requested.",
