It is based on the core principles of nuclear physics, namely mass-energy equivalence ($E=mc^2$) and conservation laws (baryon number and charge). The reactions D–T and D–D are central to fusion energy research. The provided atomic masses are consistent with high-precision, accepted values (e.g., from the AME2020 atomic mass evaluation). The use of neutral atomic masses for Q-value calculations is a standard and valid technique, as the masses of electrons cancel out when charge is conserved.

It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, well-posed, and non-trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution proceeds by first identifying the reaction products using conservation laws, then calculating the mass defect and corresponding $Q$-value for each reaction channel, and finally computing the required ratio.\n\n**1. Identification of Reaction Channels**\nLet a nucleus be denoted by ${}^{A}_{Z}X$, where $A$ is the baryon number (total number of protons and neutrons) and $Z$ is the charge number (number of protons). Conservation laws require that the sums of $A$ and $Z$ for the reactants equal the sums for the products.\n\n-   **Deuterium–Tritium (D–T) Fusion:**\n    The reactants are deuterium (${}^{2}_{1}\\mathrm{D}$) and tritium (${}^{3}_{1}\\mathrm{T}$).\n    -   Initial state: ${}^{2}_{1}\\mathrm{D} + {}^{3}_{1}\\mathrm{T}$\n    -   Total initial baryon number: $A_{\\mathrm{initial}} = 2 + 3 = 5$\n    -   Total initial charge number: $Z_{\\mathrm{initial}} = 1 + 1 = 2$\n    The products must have $A_{\\mathrm{final}} = 5$ and $Z_{\\mathrm{final}} = 2$. A highly stable nucleus is the alpha particle (${}^{4}_{2}\\mathrm{He}$). If this is one product, the other must have $A = 5 - 4 = 1$ and $Z = 2 - 2 = 0$. This particle is the neutron (${}^{1}_{0}n$).\n    The reaction is:\n    $$ {}^{2}_{1}\\mathrm{D} + {}^{3}_{1}\\mathrm{T} \\rightarrow {}^{4}_{2}\\mathrm{He} + {}^{1}_{0}n $$\n\n-   **Deuterium–Deuterium (D–D) Fusion:**\n    The reactants are two deuterium nuclei (${}^{2}_{1}\\mathrm{D}$).\n    -   Initial state: ${}^{2}_{1}\\mathrm{D} + {}^{2}_{1}\\mathrm{D}$\n    -   Total initial baryon number: $A_{\\mathrm{initial}} = 2 + 2 = 4$\n    -   Total initial charge number: $Z_{\\mathrm{initial}} = 1 + 1 = 2$\n    The products must have $A_{\\mathrm{final}} = 4$ and $Z_{\\mathrm{final}} = 2$. Two primary light-particle channels exist:\n    -   **Channel 1 (neutron branch):** The products can be helium-3 (${}^{3}_{2}\\mathrm{He}$) and a neutron (${}^{1}_{0}n$). Here, $A_{\\mathrm{final}} = 3 + 1 = 4$ and $Z_{\\mathrm{final}} = 2 + 0 = 2$. The reaction is:\n        $$ {}^{2}_{1}\\mathrm{D} + {}^{2}_{1}\\mathrm{D} \\rightarrow {}^{3}_{2}\\mathrm{He} + {}^{1}_{0}n $$\n    -   **Channel 2 (proton branch):** The products can be tritium (${}^{3}_{1}\\mathrm{T}$) and a proton (${}^{1}_{1}\\mathrm{H}$). Here, $A_{\\mathrm{final}} = 3 + 1 = 4$ and $Z_{\\mathrm{final}} = 1 + 1 = 2$. The reaction is:\n        $$ {}^{2}_{1}\\mathrm{D} + {}^{2}_{1}\\mathrm{D} \\rightarrow {}^{3}_{1}\\mathrm{T} + {}^{1}_{1}\\mathrm{H} $$\n\n**2. Calculation of Q-values**\nThe $Q$-value is calculated from the mass defect, $\\Delta m = m_{\\mathrm{initial}} - m_{\\mathrm{final}}$, using the provided atomic masses. The use of neutral atomic masses is appropriate as the total electric charge $Z$ is conserved in each reaction, ensuring that the total mass of orbital electrons cancels on both sides of the mass balance equation. The conversion constant $C = 931.49410242\\,\\mathrm{MeV}/(c^{2} \\cdot \\mathrm{u})$ allows us to write $Q = (\\Delta m / \\mathrm{u}) \\times 931.49410242\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n\n-   **$Q$-value for D–T Fusion ($Q_{\\mathrm{D–T}}$):**\n    -   Initial mass: $m_{\\mathrm{initial}} = m_{\\mathrm{D}} + m_{\\mathrm{T}} = 2.01410177812\\,\\mathrm{u} + 3.01604928199\\,\\mathrm{u} = 5.03015106011\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n    -   Final mass: $m_{\\mathrm{final}} = m_{{}^{4}\\mathrm{He}} + m_{n} = 4.00260325413\\,\\mathrm{u} + 1.00866491588\\,\\mathrm{u} = 5.01126816901\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n    -   Mass defect: $\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{D–T}} = m_{\\mathrm{initial}} - m_{\\mathrm{final}} = 5.03015106011\\,\\mathrm{u} - 5.01126816901\\,\\mathrm{u} = 0.0188828911\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n\n-   **$Q$-values for D–D Fusion:**\n    -   Initial mass for both channels: $m_{\\mathrm{initial}} = m_{\\mathrm{D}} + m_{\\mathrm{D}} = 2 \\times 2.01410177812\\,\\mathrm{u} = 4.02820355624\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n    -   **Channel 1 ($Q_{\\mathrm{D-D},1}$):**\n        -   Final mass: $m_{\\mathrm{final},1} = m_{{}^{3}\\mathrm{He}} + m_{n} = 3.0160293201\\,\\mathrm{u} + 1.00866491588\\,\\mathrm{u} = 4.02469423598\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n        -   Mass defect: $\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{D-D},1} = 4.02820355624\\,\\mathrm{u} - 4.02469423598\\,\\mathrm{u} = 0.00350932026\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n    -   **Channel 2 ($Q_{\\mathrm{D-D},2}$):**\n        -   Final mass: $m_{\\mathrm{final},2} = m_{\\mathrm{T}} + m_{\\mathrm{H}} = 3.01604928199\\,\\mathrm{u} + 1.00782503223\\,\\mathrm{u} = 4.02387431422\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n        -   Mass defect: $\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{D-D},2} = 4.02820355624\\,\\mathrm{u} - 4.02387431422\\,\\mathrm{u} = 0.00432924202\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n\n**3. Thermonuclear-Average D–D Q-value**\nThe problem stipulates that the two D–D channels have equal partial cross sections, so the thermonuclear-average $Q$-value, $\\langle Q_{\\mathrm{D-D}} \\rangle$, is the arithmetic mean of the channel $Q$-values. This is equivalent to averaging the mass defects.\n$$ \\langle \\Delta m_{\\mathrm{D-D}} \\rangle = \\frac{\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{D-D},1} + \\Delta m_{\\mathrm{D-D},2}}{2} $$\n$$ \\langle \\Delta m_{\\mathrm{D-D}} \\rangle = \\frac{0.00350932026\\,\\mathrm{u} + 0.00432924202\\,\\mathrm{u}}{2} = \\frac{0.00783856228\\,\\mathrm{u}}{2} = 0.00391928114\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\n\n**4. Calculation of the Ratio $\\mathcal{R}$**\nThe ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ is defined as $\\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{D-T}}}{\\langle Q_{\\mathrm{D-D}} \\rangle}$. Since $Q$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta m$, the conversion constants cancel out, and the ratio can be computed directly from the mass defects.\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{D–T}}}{\\langle Q_{\\mathrm{D-D}} \\rangle} = \\frac{\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{D–T}} \\cdot c^2}{\\langle \\Delta m_{\\mathrm{D-D}} \\rangle \\cdot c^2} = \\frac{\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{D–T}}}{\\langle \\Delta m_{\\mathrm{D-D}} \\rangle} $$\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{0.0188828911\\,\\mathrm{u}}{0.00391928114\\,\\mathrm{u}} \\approx 4.81804006 $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives $4.818$.\nFor completeness, the individual energy releases are:\n$Q_{\\mathrm{D-T}} = 0.0188828911 \\times 931.49410242 \\approx 17.589\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$\n$\\langle Q_{\\mathrm{D-D}} \\rangle = 0.00391928114 \\times 931.49410242 \\approx 3.651\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$\nThe ratio is $\\frac{17.589...}{3.651...} \\approx 4.818$.",

The error $\\varepsilon$ is dimensionless, so no physical unit applies to the outputs.\n\nTest Suite:\nCompute $\\varepsilon$ for the following independent cases, each given as $(T_D, T_T, n_D, n_T)$ with $T_D$ and $T_T$ in $\\mathrm{keV}$ and $n_D$, $n_T$ in $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$:\n- Case $1$: $(10, 12, 5\\times 10^{19}, 5\\times 10^{19})$.\n- Case $2$: $(5, 20, 10^{20}, 10^{20})$.\n- Case $3$: $(15, 9, 2\\times 10^{19}, 8\\times 10^{19})$.\n- Case $4$: $(10, 10, 10^{20}, 10^{20})$.\n- Case $5$: $(1, 3, 4\\times 10^{19}, 10^{20})$.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the same order as the cases above, for example $[x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5]$ where each $x_i$ is the computed decimal value of $\\varepsilon$ for Case $i$.",
            "solution": "This problem requires a first-principles derivation of the Maxwellian-averaged fusion reactivity $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ for two ion species at unequal temperatures, and a quantification of the error introduced by the common equal-temperature approximation. We will proceed by first deriving the distribution of relative velocities for two independent Maxwellian gases, then using this to formulate the reactivity integral, and finally setting up the numerical calculation for the specified error metric $\\varepsilon$.\n\n**1. Distribution of Relative Velocity and Effective Temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$**\n\nLet the two ion species be deuterium ($D$) and tritium ($T$), with masses $m_D$ and $m_T$, and number densities $n_D$ and $n_T$. The species are assumed to follow independent three-dimensional Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distributions at their respective temperatures, $T_D$ and $T_T$. We express temperatures in units of energy ($k_B T \\to T$), so the distributions are:\n$$\nf_D(\\vec{v}_D) = \\left(\\frac{m_D}{2\\pi T_D}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_D v_D^2}{2 T_D}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nf_T(\\vec{v}_T) = \\left(\\frac{m_T}{2\\pi T_T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_T v_T^2}{2 T_T}\\right)\n$$\nThe fusion reactivity depends on the distribution of the relative velocity $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}_D - \\vec{v}_T$. A powerful method to find the distribution of a sum or difference of independent random variables is to use their characteristic functions (the Fourier transform of the probability density function). The characteristic function for a species $s$ with velocity $\\vec{v}_s$ is:\n$$\n\\phi_s(\\vec{k}) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{i \\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{v}_s}\\right] = \\int e^{i \\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{v}_s} f_s(\\vec{v}_s) d^3v_s = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_s k^2}{2 m_s}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\vec{v}_D$ and $\\vec{v}_T$ are independent, the characteristic function of their difference $\\vec{v}$ is the product of their individual characteristic functions (with appropriate arguments):\n$$\n\\phi_{\\vec{v}}(\\vec{k}) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{i \\vec{k} \\cdot (\\vec{v}_D - \\vec{v}_T)}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{i \\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{v}_D}\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-i \\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{v}_T}\\right] = \\phi_D(\\vec{k}) \\phi_T(-\\vec{k})\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\phi_D$ and $\\phi_T$:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\vec{v}}(\\vec{k}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_D k^2}{2 m_D}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_T (-\\vec{k})^2}{2 m_T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2}{2} \\left(\\frac{T_D}{m_D} + \\frac{T_T}{m_T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis resulting characteristic function has the same functional form as that for a single Maxwellian population. By comparing it to a generic form $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{eff}} k^2}{2 \\mu}\\right)$, where $\\mu$ is the reduced mass $\\mu = \\frac{m_D m_T}{m_D + m_T}$, we can identify the effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ that characterizes the relative velocity distribution.\n$$\n\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\mu} = \\frac{T_D}{m_D} + \\frac{T_T}{m_T}\n$$\nSolving for $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ yields:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{T_D}{m_D} + \\frac{T_T}{m_T} \\right) = \\frac{m_D m_T}{m_D + m_T} \\left( \\frac{T_D}{m_D} + \\frac{T_T}{m_T} \\right) = \\frac{m_T T_D + m_D T_T}{m_D + m_T}\n$$\nThis is the physically correct effective temperature governing the reacting pair kinematics. The relative velocity $\\vec{v}$ follows a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution corresponding to a fictitious particle of mass $\\mu$ at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\n**2. Maxwellian-Averaged Reactivity $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$**\n\nThe Maxwellian-averaged reactivity $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ for a given temperature parameter $T$ (which can be $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ or $T_i$) is the average of the product of the fusion cross section $\\sigma$ and the relative speed $v=|\\vec{v}|$ over the distribution of relative speeds. The distribution of relative speeds $f(v)$ is obtained from the velocity distribution $f_{\\vec{v}}(\\vec{v})$ by integrating over spherical shells in velocity space:\n$$f(v)dv = 4\\pi v^2 \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu v^2}{2 T}\\right) dv.$$\nThe reactivity is then:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T) = \\int_0^\\infty v \\sigma(v) f(v) dv = \\int_0^\\infty v \\sigma(v) 4\\pi v^2 \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu v^2}{2 T}\\right) dv\n$$\nIt is more convenient to change the integration variable to the center-of-mass energy $E = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu v^2$. This gives $v = \\sqrt{2E/\\mu}$ and $dv = \\frac{dE}{\\sqrt{2\\mu E}}$. Substituting these into the integral:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T) = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma(E) \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{\\mu}} \\frac{2E}{\\mu} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{T}\\right) \\frac{dE}{\\sqrt{2\\mu E}}\n$$\nAfter simplification, we arrive at the standard formula for Maxwellian-averaged reactivity:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{\\mu\\pi}} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty E \\, \\sigma(E) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{T}\\right) dE\n$$\nWe now substitute the given low-energy barrier-penetration model for the cross section, $\\sigma(E) = \\frac{S_0}{E} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{b}{\\sqrt{E}}\\right)$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{\\mu\\pi}} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty E \\left(\\frac{S_0}{E} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{b}{\\sqrt{E}}\\right)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{T}\\right) dE\n$$\nThe energy term $E$ in the integrand cancels:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T) = S_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{\\mu\\pi}} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{T} - \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{E}}\\right) dE\n$$\n\n**3. Error Formulation and Numerical Strategy**\n\nThe problem defines the error $\\varepsilon$ due to the equal-temperature assumption. This assumption uses a single ion temperature $T_i = \\frac{n_D T_D + n_T T_T}{n_D + n_T}$. The error is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T_i) - \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T_{\\mathrm{eff}})}{\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T_{\\mathrm{eff}})} = \\frac{\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T_i)}{\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T_{\\mathrm{eff}})} - 1\n$$\nNotice that the constant prefactor $S_0 \\sqrt{8/(\\mu\\pi)}$ cancels in the ratio, meaning the error is independent of the astrophysical $S$-factor $S_0$. Let's define a function $F(T)$ proportional to the reactivity:\n$$\nF(T) = T^{-3/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{T} - \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{E}}\\right) dE\n$$\nThen, $\\varepsilon = \\frac{F(T_i)}{F(T_{\\mathrm{eff}})} - 1$.\nFor numerical stability, we introduce a dimensionless variable of integration, $x = E/T$. Then $E = xT$ and $dE = T dx$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-x - \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{xT}}\\right) T dx = T \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-x - \\frac{b/\\sqrt{T}}{\\sqrt{x}}\\right) dx\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $F(T)$:\n$$\nF(T) = T^{-3/2} \\cdot T \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-x - \\frac{b/\\sqrt{T}}{\\sqrt{x}}\\right) dx = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}} \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-x - \\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{x}}\\right) dx\n$$\nwhere we have defined $\\beta = b/\\sqrt{T}$. Let $J(\\beta) = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-x - \\beta/\\sqrt{x}) dx$. Then:\n$$\nF(T) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}} J(b/\\sqrt{T}).\n$$\nThe error $\\varepsilon$ can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T_i}} J(b/\\sqrt{T_i})}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T_{\\mathrm{eff}}}} J(b/\\sqrt{T_{\\mathrm{eff}}})} - 1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{T_i}} \\frac{J(b/\\sqrt{T_i})}{J(b/\\sqrt{T_{\\mathrm{eff}}})} - 1\n$$\nThis is the final expression to be implemented. The integral $J(\\beta)$ will be computed numerically.\n\n**4. Constants**\n\nThe following constants are used in the computation:\n- Deuteron mass: $m_D = 2.013553212745$ amu\n- Triton mass: $m_T = 3.01550071632$ amu\n- Reduced mass: $\\mu = \\frac{m_D m_T}{m_D + m_T} \\approx 1.207865389$ amu\n- Nuclear charges for D-T: $Z_1 = 1, Z_2 = 1$\n- Gamow parameter: $b = 31.39 Z_1 Z_2 \\sqrt{\\mu} \\approx 31.39 \\times \\sqrt{1.207865389} \\approx 34.478034$ keV$^{1/2}$.\n\nThe computation will proceed by calculating $T_i$ and $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for each test case, then numerically evaluating the corresponding $J(\\beta)$ integrals to find the error $\\varepsilon$. For the case $T_D = T_T$, it is straightforward to show that $T_i = T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, leading to $\\varepsilon = 0$, which serves as a validation check.",
