This exercise presents a classic thought experiment to build physical intuition for this fundamental anisotropy. By considering the response of an ideal magnetized plasma to compression both along and across the magnetic field lines, you will explore how the principle of flux-freezing leads to dramatically different outcomes, isolating the distinct roles of magnetic pressure and tension.",

            "problem": "Consider a perfectly conducting, quasi-neutral plasma threaded by an initially uniform, straight magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B_0 \\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ in the ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) limit. The plasma is confined within a cylindrical flux tube of radius $R$ and length $L$, bounded by perfectly conducting, frictionless walls and moved quasi-statically by externally controlled pistons. Gravity, viscosity, and resistivity are negligible, and the system remains non-relativistic. One can actuate either axial pistons at the ends to change $L$ (compression parallel to $\\mathbf{B}$), or radial pistons to change $R$ (compression perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$). The manipulations are sufficiently slow that inertial terms are negligible and the system is always close to magnetostatic equilibrium.\n\nStarting from fundamental laws of classical electromagnetism (Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force density), and the ideal flux-freezing property of ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), choose the single option that correctly explains why magnetic pressure does not resist uniform compression along $\\mathbf{B}$ in this configuration and proposes a scientifically sound, quasi-static thought experiment that isolates the anisotropic character of magnetic stresses. The thought experiment should clearly indicate which measurable quantities (for example, the force on a piston or the evolution of $B$ and magnetic energy density) would demonstrate the anisotropy.\n\nA. Magnetic energy density $B^2/(2\\mu_0)$ increases for any reduction in plasma volume, so magnetic pressure is isotropic and resists compression equally in all directions. A suitable test is to compress the cylinder both axially and radially by the same fractional volume change and verify that the required external forces on the pistons are equal.\n\nB. Under uniform axial compression in which the cross-sectional area $A_\\perp$ remains constant, ideal flux-freezing enforces conservation of magnetic flux $\\Phi = \\int \\mathbf{B}\\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = B\\,A_\\perp$, so $B$ remains unchanged and the magnetic pressure gradient vanishes; magnetic tension appears only for bending or longitudinal gradients of $\\mathbf{B}$, which are absent in a straight, uniform field. In contrast, radial compression reduces $A_\\perp$ and increases $B$ so that magnetic pressure opposes the motion. A suitable test is to perform two quasi-static experiments: ($1$) compress the cylinder axially to reduce $L$ while monitoring the force on the axial pistons and the field magnitude $B$ (finding negligible magnetic contribution to the axial piston force and no change in $B$); ($2$) compress the cylinder radially to reduce $R$, measuring a growing opposing force from the magnetic pressure $p_m = B^2/(2\\mu_0)$ acting over the piston area and a concomitant increase in $B$.\n\nC. Magnetic pressure resists axial compression because decreasing the length $L$ at fixed radius $R$ increases $B$ as $B \\propto 1/L$, raising magnetic energy density and pressure; a suitable test is to shorten the cylinder and measure an increase in $B$ and an equal magnetic force on the axial pistons as in radial compression.\n\nD. The anisotropic character of magnetic stresses arises only from finite electrical conductivity and resistive diffusion; in the limit of ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), magnetic pressure is isotropic, so both axial and radial compressions face identical magnetic resistance. A suitable test is to vary the resistivity and watch the anisotropy vanish as resistivity tends to zero.",
            "solution": "This problem explores the anisotropic nature of magnetic forces within the framework of ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The key principle is **flux-freezing**, which states that magnetic field lines are \"frozen\" into the perfectly conducting plasma and move with it. We analyze two separate cases of compression.\n\n**Case 1: Axial Compression (along $\\mathbf{B}$)**\nThe plasma is compressed by moving pistons at the ends, changing the length $L$ but keeping the cross-sectional area $A_\\perp$ constant. The plasma velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is parallel to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$. The ideal MHD induction equation is $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$. Since $\\mathbf{v}$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{B}$, their cross product $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} = 0$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = 0$. This means the magnetic field strength $B$ does not change during axial compression. As a result, the magnetic pressure $p_m = \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}$ also remains constant, and the magnetic field exerts no force to resist this compression.\n\n**Case 2: Radial Compression (perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$)**\nThe plasma is compressed by moving the cylindrical walls inward, changing the radius $R$ and thus the cross-sectional area $A_\\perp$. Here, the consequence of flux-freezing is that the total magnetic flux $\\Phi = B A_\\perp$ through the plasma's cross-section is conserved.\nAs the area $A_\\perp$ decreases, the magnetic field strength $B$ must increase to keep the product constant ($B \\propto 1/A_\\perp$). This increase in $B$ leads to a sharp increase in magnetic pressure $p_m = \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}$, which exerts a strong outward force, resisting the compression.\n\n**Conclusion and Option Analysis**\nThe magnetic field strongly resists compression perpendicular to its direction but offers no resistance to compression parallel to it. This demonstrates the fundamental anisotropy of magnetic forces. Let's evaluate the options based on this understanding:\n*   **A** is incorrect. It claims magnetic pressure is isotropic, which our analysis shows is false.\n*   **B** is correct. It accurately describes that $B$ remains unchanged during axial compression and increases during radial compression, leading to an opposing pressure force in the latter case. The proposed two-part experiment would perfectly demonstrate this anisotropy.\n*   **C** is incorrect. It falsely claims that $B$ increases during axial compression.\n*   **D** is incorrect. It claims that anisotropy arises from non-ideal effects (resistivity). The opposite is true: this stark anisotropy is a core feature of *ideal* MHD. Resistivity would allow the plasma to slip through field lines, weakening this effect.\n\nThe analysis confirms that Option B provides the correct physical explanation and experimental design.",

            "solution": "The problem requires us to first establish the concept of magnetic pressure and then use it to calculate the plasma beta, $\\beta$.\n\nWe begin with the Lorentz force density on a plasma, which, in a magnetostatic equilibrium, balances the plasma pressure gradient. The force density $\\mathbf{f}$ exerted by a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ on a current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nIn magnetostatics, Ampere's Law relates the current density to the magnetic field:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability. We can express the current density as $\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$ and substitute it into the force density equation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right) \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nUsing the vector calculus identity $(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) \\times \\mathbf{A} = (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{A} - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla(A^2)$, we can rewrite the force density as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\left( (\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{B} - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla(B^2) \\right)\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to highlight the physical nature of the magnetic forces:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f} = -\\nabla\\left(\\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThe first term, $-\\nabla\\left(\\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}\\right)$, is a force directed from regions of high magnetic field strength to low magnetic field strength. It has the form of a pressure gradient, and hence the quantity $p_m = \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}$ is identified as the **magnetic pressure**. The second term, $\\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{B}$, represents a tension along the magnetic field lines, analogous to the tension in a stretched string.\n\nThis force density can be equivalently expressed as the divergence of the Maxwell stress tensor $\\mathbf{T}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{T} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad T_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\left(B_i B_j - \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{ij}B^2\\right)\n$$\nThe force per unit area on a surface with outward normal $\\hat{n}$ is given by $\\mathbf{T} \\cdot \\hat{n}$. In the context of a tokamak, the plasma is confined by magnetic fields that are predominantly parallel to the boundary surface. If the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is parallel to this surface, then $\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\hat{n} = 0$. The force per unit area on the surface is a pressure (a force directed opposite to $\\hat{n}$) of magnitude $\\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}$. This validates identifying $p_m = \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}$ as the effective magnetic pressure that confines the plasma.\n\nNow we can proceed with the calculation.
