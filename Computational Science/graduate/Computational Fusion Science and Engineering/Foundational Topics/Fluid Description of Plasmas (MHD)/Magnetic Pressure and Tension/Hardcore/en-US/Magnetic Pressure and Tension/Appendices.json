            "solution": "The problem requires us to establish the concept of magnetic pressure and then use it to calculate the plasma beta, $\\beta$.\n\nWe begin with the Lorentz force density on a plasma, $\\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}$. In magnetostatics, Ampere's Law relates the current density to the magnetic field: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}$. Substituting this into the force density equation gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right) \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nUsing a vector calculus identity, we can rewrite the force density as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f} = -\\nabla\\left(\\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThe first term, $-\\nabla\\left(\\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}\\right)$, is a force directed from regions of high magnetic field strength to low magnetic field strength. It has the form of a pressure gradient, and hence the quantity $p_m = \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}$ is identified as the **magnetic pressure**. The second term represents magnetic tension.\n\nThis force can also be derived from the Maxwell stress tensor, $T_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\left(B_i B_j - \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{ij}B^2\\right)$. For a plasma confined by a magnetic field parallel to a boundary, the force per unit area on that boundary is a pressure of magnitude $\\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}$, validating the identification of $p_m = \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}$ as the effective magnetic pressure.\n\nNow we can proceed with the calculation.

Through a carefully constructed thought experiment, you will explore the anisotropic nature of magnetic forces, a key feature of the Maxwell stress tensor.

            "problem": "Consider a perfectly conducting, quasi-neutral plasma threaded by an initially uniform, straight magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B_0 \\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ in the ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) limit. The plasma is confined within a cylindrical flux tube of radius $R$ and length $L$, bounded by perfectly conducting, frictionless walls and moved quasi-statically by externally controlled pistons. Gravity, viscosity, and resistivity are negligible, and the system remains non-relativistic. One can actuate either axial pistons at the ends to change $L$ (compression parallel to $\\mathbf{B}$), or radial pistons to change $R$ (compression perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$). The manipulations are sufficiently slow that inertial terms are negligible and the system is always close to magnetostatic equilibrium.\n\nStarting from fundamental laws of classical electromagnetism (Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force density), and the ideal flux-freezing property of ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), choose the single option that correctly explains why magnetic pressure does not resist uniform compression along $\\mathbf{B}$ in this configuration and proposes a scientifically sound, quasi-static thought experiment that isolates the anisotropic character of magnetic stresses. The thought experiment should clearly indicate which measurable quantities (for example, the force on a piston or the evolution of $B$ and magnetic energy density) would demonstrate the anisotropy.\n\nA. Magnetic energy density $B^2/(8\\pi)$ increases for any reduction in plasma volume, so magnetic pressure is isotropic and resists compression equally in all directions. A suitable test is to compress the cylinder both axially and radially by the same fractional volume change and verify that the required external forces on the pistons are equal.\n\nB. Under uniform axial compression in which the cross-sectional area $A_\\perp$ remains constant, ideal flux-freezing enforces conservation of magnetic flux $\\Phi = \\int \\mathbf{B}\\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = B\\,A_\\perp$, so $B$ remains unchanged and the magnetic pressure gradient vanishes; magnetic tension appears only for bending or longitudinal gradients of $\\mathbf{B}$, which are absent in a straight, uniform field. In contrast, radial compression reduces $A_\\perp$ and increases $B$ so that magnetic pressure opposes the motion. A suitable test is to perform two quasi-static experiments: ($1$) compress the cylinder axially to reduce $L$ while monitoring the force on the axial pistons and the field magnitude $B$ (finding negligible magnetic contribution to the axial piston force and no change in $B$); ($2$) compress the cylinder radially to reduce $R$, measuring a growing opposing force approximately equal to the magnetic pressure $B^2/(8\\pi)$ over the piston area and a concomitant increase in $B$.\n\nC. Magnetic pressure resists axial compression because decreasing the length $L$ at fixed radius $R$ increases $B$ as $B \\propto 1/L$, raising magnetic energy density and pressure; a suitable test is to shorten the cylinder and measure an increase in $B$ and an equal magnetic force on the axial pistons as in radial compression.\n\nD. The anisotropic character of magnetic stresses arises only from finite electrical conductivity and resistive diffusion; in the limit of ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), magnetic pressure is isotropic, so both axial and radial compressions face identical magnetic resistance. A suitable test is to vary the resistivity and watch the anisotropy vanish as resistivity tends to zero.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for an explanation and a thought experiment demonstrating the anisotropic nature of magnetic stress in ideal MHD. We analyze the plasma's response to compression parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The key principles are the ideal MHD induction equation, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$, and the concept of magnetic flux conservation.\n\n**Case 1: Axial Compression (Parallel to B)**\nThe plasma is compressed along the z-axis, so the plasma velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is parallel to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$. In this case, the cross product $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} = 0$. The induction equation simplifies to $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = 0$. This means the magnetic field strength $B$ remains constant during axial compression. Since $B$ does not change, the magnetic pressure (whether in SI units, $p_m = B^2/(2\\mu_0)$, or Gaussian units, $p_m=B^2/(8\\pi)$) also remains constant. The magnetic field offers no resistance to this compression.\n\n**Case 2: Radial Compression (Perpendicular to B)**\nThe plasma is compressed radially, squeezing the magnetic field lines together. According to the principle of flux freezing in ideal MHD, the total magnetic flux $\\Phi = B A_\\perp$ through the cylinder's cross-sectional area $A_\\perp = \\pi R^2$ must be conserved. As the radius $R$ decreases, the area $A_\\perp$ decreases, so the magnetic field strength $B$ must increase to keep $\\Phi$ constant ($B \\propto 1/A_\\perp \\propto 1/R^2$). The magnetic pressure increases dramatically ($p_m \\propto B^2 \\propto 1/R^4$). This increased magnetic pressure exerts an outward force, strongly resisting the radial compression.\n\n**Conclusion and Evaluation of Options:**\nThe magnetic field resists compression perpendicular to its direction but not parallel to it. This demonstrates the anisotropic nature of magnetic stress.\n\n*   **A:** Incorrect. It falsely claims magnetic pressure is isotropic. As shown, it does not resist axial compression.\n*   **B:** Correct. It accurately describes that $B$ is unchanged during axial compression but increases during radial compression due to flux-freezing. It correctly attributes the resistance to magnetic pressure in the radial case. The proposed two-part experiment would perfectly demonstrate this anisotropy by measuring the force on the pistons and the field strength $B$ in each case.\n*   **C:** Incorrect. It falsely claims that $B \\propto 1/L$ during axial compression; in fact, $B$ is constant.\n*   **D:** Incorrect. It reverses the truth. The anisotropy of magnetic stress is a fundamental property of ideal MHD. Non-ideal effects like resistivity would tend to weaken this behavior by allowing the plasma to slip through field lines.",
