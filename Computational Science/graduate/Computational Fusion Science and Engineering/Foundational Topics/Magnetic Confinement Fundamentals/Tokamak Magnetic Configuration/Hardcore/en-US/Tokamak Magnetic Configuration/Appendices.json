            "introduction": "A cornerstone of understanding tokamak physics is grasping the intimate relationship between the distribution of the plasma current and the resulting magnetic field structure. The safety factor profile, $q(r)$, is paramount for plasma stability, with its shape determining the confinement properties. This first exercise  presents a foundational thought experiment: what toroidal current density profile, $J_\\phi(r)$, is required to produce a perfectly flat safety factor, representing a 'zero-shear' magnetic configuration? By working backward from the definition of $q$, you will develop a direct intuition for how the current distribution sculpts the magnetic topology.",

            "problem": "In a tokamak, the magnetic field lines trace out helical paths on nested toroidal surfaces. The safety factor, $q(r)$, is a crucial parameter that quantifies the pitch of these helical field lines. It's defined as the number of toroidal transits a field line makes for one poloidal transit. For a large-aspect-ratio tokamak ($R_0 \\gg a$) with a circular plasma cross-section, the safety factor at a minor radius $r$ is given by the expression:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{r B_\\phi}{R_0 B_\\theta(r)}\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the minor radius, $R_0$ is the major radius, $B_\\phi$ is the toroidal magnetic field, and $B_\\theta(r)$ is the poloidal magnetic field. The poloidal magnetic field is generated by the toroidal plasma current density, $J_\\phi(r)$. The relationship between $B_\\theta(r)$ and $J_\\phi(r)$ is given by Ampere's law in its differential form, which for this geometry simplifies to:\n$$\nJ_\\phi(r) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 r} \\frac{d}{dr}\\big(r B_\\theta(r)\\big)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.\n\nFor certain plasma stability considerations, it is desirable to have a specific safety factor profile. Consider an idealized scenario where the safety factor profile is perfectly flat throughout the plasma, i.e., $q(r) = q_0$ for all $r \\in [0, a]$, where $q_0$ is a positive constant and $a$ is the minor radius of the plasma edge. Assume the toroidal magnetic field $B_\\phi$ is uniform across the plasma cross-section.\n\nDerive the functional form of the toroidal current density profile, $J_\\phi(r)$, that produces this perfectly flat safety factor profile.",

            "introduction": "Having established the link between the current and the safety factor, we now turn to the physical significance of the $q$-profile's structure. Magnetic field lines on surfaces where $q$ is a rational number ($q=m/n$) are periodic, closing back on themselves after a finite number of transits. These 'rational surfaces' are critically important as they are the locations where resonant magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities can grow, potentially degrading confinement or disrupting the plasma. This practice  provides hands-on experience in identifying the precise radial locations of these key surfaces within a realistic, analytically described $q$-profile, a common task in stability analysis.",

            "solution": "The problem requires us to find the safety factor on the magnetic axis, $q_0$. We start with the given simplified Grad-Shafranov equation and the specified current density profile.\n\n1.  **Set up the differential equation:**\n    Substitute the expression for $j_\\phi(\\psi)$ into the Grad-Shafranov equation:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{d\\psi}{dr}\\right) = -\\mu_0 R_0 \\left(\\frac{k^2}{\\mu_0 R_0} \\psi\\right)\n    $$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{d\\psi}{dr}\\right) = -k^2 \\psi\n    $$\n    Expanding the derivative gives:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d\\psi}{dr} + k^2 \\psi = 0\n    $$\n    This is the Bessel differential equation of order zero.\n\n2.  **Solve the differential equation:**\n    The general solution to this equation is a linear combination of the Bessel function of the first kind, $J_0(kr)$, and the Bessel function of the second kind, $Y_0(kr)$:\n    $$\n    \\psi(r) = C_1 J_0(kr) + C_2 Y_0(kr)\n    $$\n    where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants.\n\n3.  **Apply boundary conditions:**\n    The first boundary condition is that the solution must be regular at the magnetic axis ($r=0$). Since $Y_0(kr) \\to -\\infty$ as $r \\to 0$, we must set $C_2=0$ to avoid a singularity. The solution becomes:\n    $$\n    \\psi(r) = C_1 J_0(kr)\n    $$\n    The second boundary condition is $\\psi(0) = \\psi_0$. Using the property that $J_0(0)=1$:\n    $$\n    \\psi(0) = C_1 J_0(0) = C_1 = \\psi_0\n    $$\n    So, the specific solution for the poloidal flux is:\n    $$\n    \\psi(r) = \\psi_0 J_0(kr)\n    $$\n    The third boundary condition, $\\psi(a)=0$, implies that $J_0(ka)=0$. This means that $ka$ must be a zero of the Bessel function $J_0(x)$. This condition quantizes the possible values of $k$ for a given radius $a$, but we will not need the specific value of the zero for this derivation.\n\n4.  **Calculate the poloidal magnetic field, $B_p(r)$:**\n    The poloidal field is given by $B_p(r) = \\frac{1}{R_0} \\frac{d\\psi}{dr}$. We differentiate our solution for $\\psi(r)$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d\\psi}{dr} = \\psi_0 \\frac{d}{dr} J_0(kr)\n    $$\n    Using the identity $\\frac{d}{dx}J_0(x) = -J_1(x)$, we have:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d\\psi}{dr} = \\psi_0 (-k J_1(kr)) = -k\\psi_0 J_1(kr)\n    $$\n    Therefore, the poloidal magnetic field is:\n    $$\n    B_p(r) = -\\frac{k\\psi_0}{R_0} J_1(kr)\n    $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the on-axis safety factor, $q_0$:**\n    The safety factor is $q(r) = \\frac{r B_\\phi(r)}{R_0 B_p(r)}$. To find its value on axis, we take the limit as $r \\to 0$:\n    $$\n    q_0 = \\lim_{r \\to 0} q(r) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{r B_\\phi(r)}{R_0 B_p(r)}\n    $$\n    We know that $B_\\phi(r) \\to B_0$ as $r \\to 0$. Substituting the expression for $B_p(r)$:\n    $$\n    q_0 = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{r B_0}{R_0 \\left(-\\frac{k\\psi_0}{R_0} J_1(kr)\\right)} = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{r B_0}{-k\\psi_0 J_1(kr)}\n    $$\n    The safety factor $q$ is physically a positive quantity, representing the number of toroidal turns per poloidal turn. The negative sign in $B_p$ indicates the direction of the field relative to the coordinate system, so we consider the magnitude.\n    $$\n    q_0 = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{r B_0}{k\\psi_0 J_1(kr)}\n    $$\n    To evaluate this limit, we use the small-argument approximation for the Bessel function $J_1(x)$ for $x \\ll 1$:\n    $$\n    J_1(x) \\approx \\frac{x}{2}\n    $$\n    So for small $r$, $J_1(kr) \\approx \\frac{kr}{2}$. Substituting this into the limit:\n    $$\n    q_0 = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{r B_0}{k\\psi_0 \\left(\\frac{kr}{2}\\right)} = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{r B_0}{\\frac{k^2\\psi_0 r}{2}}\n    $$\n    The factor of $r$ cancels out:\n    $$\n    q_0 = \\frac{B_0}{\\frac{k^2\\psi_0}{2}} = \\frac{2B_0}{k^2\\psi_0}\n    $$\n    This is the final expression for the safety factor on the magnetic axis.",
