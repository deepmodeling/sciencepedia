            "solution": "The problem statement is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) as applied to tokamak devices, well-posed as a conceptual question about geometric parametrizations, and objective in its language.\n\nWe begin by analyzing the provided simple torus map and the assumptions under which it is a valid approximation for tokamak flux surfaces.\nThe parametrization is given in cylindrical coordinates $(R, \\phi, Z)$ as:\n$$R(\\theta,r) = R_0 + r\\cos\\theta$$\n$$Z(\\theta,r) = r\\sin\\theta$$\n$$\\phi = \\phi$$\nHere, $R_0$ is the major radius, $r$ is a minor-radius-like coordinate, and $\\theta$ is a poloidal angle.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of the Simple Torus Map and its Underlying Assumptions**\n\n1.  **Geometric Shape**: For a fixed value of $r$, the equations for $R$ and $Z$ describe a circle in the poloidal ($R, Z$) plane. The center of this circle is at $(R, Z) = (R_0, 0)$, and its radius is $r$. Since flux surfaces are surfaces of constant poloidal flux $\\psi$, this parametrization implicitly assumes that the flux surfaces are concentric circles in the poloidal plane.\n\n2.  **Consequences of Concentric Circular Flux Surfaces**:\n    *   **Circular Cross-Section**: The shape is a circle, which means the elongation $\\kappa$ is unity ($\\kappa=1$) and the triangularity $\\delta$ is zero ($\\delta=0$).\n    *   **No Shafranov Shift**: The centers of all flux surfaces (for all $r$) are located at the same major radius $R_0$. In a real MHD equilibrium with finite plasma pressure, the flux surfaces are shifted outwards in major radius relative to the geometric center of the vacuum vessel. This phenomenon is known as the Shafranov shift, $\\Delta$. The concentric nature of the surfaces in this simple map implies that the Shafranov shift is zero, $\\Delta=0$.\n    *   **Physical Limit**: The Shafranov shift is driven by the plasma pressure (gradient of pressure) and the poloidal magnetic field (current). A zero shift corresponds to the limit of zero plasma pressure, characterized by the plasma beta parameter $\\beta = (2\\mu_0 \\langle p \\rangle)/B^2 \\to 0$, and negligible poloidal current. In practice, this an approximation valid for low-pressure plasmas, i.e., $\\beta \\ll 1$.\n\n3.  **Role of Aspect Ratio**: Toroidal effects, which are responsible for the Shafranov shift and deviations from circularity, scale with the inverse aspect ratio, $\\epsilon = a/R_0$, where $a$ is the minor radius of the plasma. The simple torus map is the leading-order approximation in the large-aspect-ratio limit, $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. In the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$, a torus becomes a straight cylinder, for which the equilibrium flux surfaces are indeed concentric circles.\n\n4.  **Axisymmetry**: The parametrization does not depend on the toroidal angle $\\phi$. This is consistent with the assumption of an axisymmetric equilibrium, a cornerstone of the Grad-Shafranov equation and standard tokamak theory.\n\nIn summary, the simple torus map is a reasonable approximation for tokamak flux surfaces under the combined assumptions of:\n*   Axisymmetry.\n*   Large aspect ratio ($\\epsilon = r/R_0 \\ll 1$).\n*   Circular, concentric cross-sections, which implies elongation $\\kappa \\approx 1$ and triangularity $\\delta \\approx 0$.\n*   Low plasma pressure ($\\beta \\ll 1$), which leads to a negligible Shafranov shift.\n\n**Part 2: Minimal Corrections for Finite Shafranov Shift and Elongation**\n\nTo make the geometric model more realistic, we must introduce corrections that account for a finite Shafranov shift and non-circular (elongated) cross-sections, while remaining consistent with an axisymmetric MHD equilibrium.\n\n1.  **Coordinates as Flux Functions**: In a true equilibrium, the geometric coordinates should be tied to the magnetic flux. Thus, the radial-like coordinate $r$ is no longer an independent geometric parameter but becomes a function of the poloidal flux, $r=r(\\psi)$. Similarly, quantities that describe the shape and position of a flux surface, such as the shift and elongation, will also be functions of $\\psi$.\n\n2.  **Incorporating the Shafranov Shift ($\\Delta$)**: The Shafranov shift is a uniform horizontal displacement of the center of a flux surface. The center is moved from $R_0$ to $R_0 + \\Delta(\\psi)$. The correction is applied to the $R$ coordinate:\n    $$R(\\psi,\\theta) = (R_0 + \\Delta(\\psi)) + r(\\psi)\\cos\\theta$$\n\n3.  **Incorporating Elongation ($\\kappa$)**: Elongation describes the vertical stretching of the flux surface. A simple way to introduce this is to scale the vertical component of the circular shape, $r(\\psi)\\sin\\theta$, by an elongation factor $\\kappa(\\psi)$:\n    $$Z(\\psi,\\theta) = \\kappa(\\psi) r(\\psi)\\sin\\theta$$\n    For $\\kappa > 1$, the surface is vertically elongated.\n\nThe minimal corrected parametrization is therefore:\n$$R(\\psi,\\theta) = R_0 + \\Delta(\\psi) + r(\\psi)\\cos\\theta$$\n$$Z(\\psi,\\theta) = \\kappa(\\psi) r(\\psi)\\sin\\theta$$\nThe toroidal coordinate $\\phi$ remains unchanged to preserve axisymmetry.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **Option A**:\n    *   **Assumptions**: \"assumes axisymmetry, large aspect ratio $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, circular and concentric cross-sections with elongation $\\kappa \\simeq 1$ and triangularity $\\delta \\simeq 0$, and low pressure $\\beta \\ll 1$.\" This is a complete and accurate summary of the assumptions derived above.\n    *   **Corrections**: It proposes the transformation to $R(\\psi,\\theta) = R_0 + \\Delta(\\psi) + r(\\psi)\\cos\\theta$ and $Z(\\psi,\\theta) = \\kappa(\\psi)\\,r(\\psi)\\sin\\theta$. This exactly matches our derived corrections. It also correctly notes that $r$ should be interpreted as a flux function $r(\\psi)$ and that $\\phi$ is unchanged. The final comment about replacing the geometric angle $\\theta$ with a straight-field-line angle for \"metric fidelity\" is a valid and sophisticated point in advanced computational modeling.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n*   **Option B**:\n    *   **Assumptions**: \"assumes non-axisymmetry\" and \"moderate pressure $\\beta \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$\". These are both incorrect. The simple map is axisymmetric, and it corresponds to the low-pressure, not moderate-pressure, limit.\n    *   **Corrections**: Proposes shifting $Z$ by $\\Delta(\\psi)$ and scaling $\\phi$ by $\\kappa(\\psi)$. Shifting $Z$ represents a vertical displacement, not the horizontal Shafranov shift. Scaling $\\phi$ is physically meaningless in the context of elongation and incorrectly breaks axisymmetry.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**:\n    *   **Assumptions**: \"requires a safety factor $q(\\psi)\\approx 0$\". This is incorrect. A safety factor $q \\to 0$ corresponds to an infinite poloidal field, which is physically nonsensical and highly unstable. The simple model is compatible with finite, typically large ($q>1$), safety factors.\n    *   **Corrections**: The proposed form $R(\\psi,\\theta) = R_0 + (r(\\psi)+\\Delta(\\psi))\\cos\\theta$ incorrectly applies the shift as a modification to the minor radius, making the shift itself poloidally dependent, rather than as a uniform displacement of the axis. It also incorrectly states that elongation is implemented by scaling $R$. Elongation is a vertical stretching and must modify $Z$.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D**:\n    *   **Assumptions**: \"assumes high pressure $\\beta \\gtrsim 1$\". This is incorrect. High pressure would induce a large Shafranov shift, which the simple model lacks.\n    *   **Corrections**: It uses the same flawed form for the shift as option C: $R \\propto (r+\\Delta)\\cos\\theta$. It also leaves $Z$ unchanged, thereby failing to implement elongation as requested. The transformation on $\\phi$ is a change to straight-field-line coordinates, which is a coordinate relabeling, not an implementation of a geometric shape change like shift or elongation.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option E**:\n    *   **Assumptions**: \"assumes axisymmetry and large aspect ratio with circular cross-section.\" This is partially correct but less complete than in option A, as it omits the crucial condition of low pressure / concentricity.\n    *   **Corrections**: The problem asks for minimal corrections for *shift and elongation*. This option adds a correction for *triangularity* as well, which goes beyond the minimal requirement. Furthermore, the proposed correction for triangularity, adding $\\delta(\\psi)\\,r(\\psi)\\sin\\theta$ to $R$, is not the standard representation. Standard D-shaping is symmetric with respect to the midplane ($Z=0$), whereas this term introduces an up-down asymmetry in the major radius.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, Option A is the only one that correctly identifies the assumptions of the simple model and provides the standard, physically correct transformations to include a finite Shafranov shift and poloidal elongation.",

The surface itself is parameterized using a poloidal angle $\\theta$ and a toroidal angle $\\zeta$, where the mapping to cylindrical coordinates is given by:\n$$R(\\theta) = R_0 + r \\cos\\theta$$\n$$Z(\\theta) = r \\sin\\theta$$\n$$\\phi = \\zeta$$\nHere, $R_0$ is the major radius of the torus and $r$ is the minor radius of the flux surface.\n\nA field-aligned coordinate system $(\\alpha, \\zeta)$ is introduced. The coordinate $\\alpha$ is constant along a magnetic field line and is defined by the relation $\\alpha = \\theta - \\zeta/q$, where $q$ is the safety factor. This implies the transformation from the computational coordinates $(\\alpha, \\zeta)$ to the geometric angles $(\\theta, \\zeta)$ is:\n$$\\theta(\\alpha, \\zeta) = \\alpha + \\frac{\\zeta}{q}$$\n$$\\zeta(\\alpha, \\zeta) = \\zeta$$\nA uniform, doubly periodic mesh is constructed in the computational domain $(\\alpha, \\zeta) \\in [0, 2\\pi) \\times [0, 2\\pi)$. With $N_\\alpha$ nodes in the $\\alpha$ direction and $N_\\zeta$ nodes in the $\\zeta$ direction, the mesh points $(\\alpha_i, \\zeta_j)$ are given by:\n$$\\alpha_i = i \\frac{2\\pi}{N_\\alpha}, \\quad i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N_\\alpha - 1\\}$$\n$$\\zeta_j = j \\frac{2\\pi}{N_\\zeta}, \\quad j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N_\\zeta - 1\\}$$\n\n**2. Covariant Metric Tensor Derivation**\n\nTo calculate distances on the surface, we first derive the covariant metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ induced by the Euclidean embedding. The line element on the surface is $ds^2 = g_{\\mu\\nu} du^\\mu du^\\nu$, where $u^\\mu$ are the surface coordinates.\n\nFirst, we find the metric in the $(\\theta, \\zeta)$ basis. The tangent vectors are $\\mathbf{e}_\\theta = \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}{\\partial\\theta}$ and $\\mathbf{e}_\\zeta = \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}{\\partial\\zeta}$, where $\\mathbf{x} = (R\\cos\\phi, R\\sin\\phi, Z)$ is the position vector in Cartesian coordinates.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}{\\partial\\theta} = \\begin{pmatrix} -r\\sin\\theta\\cos\\zeta \\\\ -r\\sin\\theta\\sin\\zeta \\\\ r\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}{\\partial\\zeta} = \\begin{pmatrix} -(R_0 + r\\cos\\theta)\\sin\\zeta \\\\ (R_0 + r\\cos\\theta)\\cos\\zeta \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe metric components are the dot products of these tangent vectors:\n$$g_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}{\\partial\\theta} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}{\\partial\\theta} = r^2\\sin^2\\theta(\\cos^2\\zeta + \\sin^2\\zeta) + r^2\\cos^2\\theta = r^2$$\n$$g_{\\zeta\\zeta} = \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}{\\partial\\zeta} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}{\\partial\\zeta} = (R_0+r\\cos\\theta)^2(\\sin^2\\zeta + \\cos^2\\zeta) = (R_0+r\\cos\\theta)^2$$\n$$g_{\\theta\\zeta} = \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}{\\partial\\theta} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}{\\partial\\zeta} = 0$$\nThe metric tensor in the $(\\theta, \\zeta)$ basis, which we denote $g$, is diagonal:\n$$g_{(\\theta,\\zeta)} = \\begin{pmatrix} r^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & (R_0+r\\cos\\theta)^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNext, we transform this metric to the field-aligned $(\\alpha, \\zeta)$ basis. The transformation rule for a covariant tensor of rank 2 is $g' = J^T g J$, where $J$ is the Jacobian matrix of the transformation from the new coordinates $(\\alpha, \\zeta)$ to the old coordinates $(\\theta, \\zeta)$.\n$$J = \\frac{\\partial(\\theta, \\zeta)}{\\partial(\\alpha, \\zeta)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial\\alpha} & \\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial\\zeta} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial\\zeta}{\\partial\\alpha} & \\frac{\\partial\\zeta}{\\partial\\zeta} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1/q \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n$$g'_{(\\alpha,\\zeta)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1/q & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} r^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & (R_0+r\\cos\\theta)^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1/q \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$g'_{(\\alpha,\\zeta)} = \\begin{pmatrix} r^2 & r^2/q \\\\ r^2/q & r^2/q^2 + (R_0+r\\cos\\theta)^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe components of the metric in the non-orthogonal $(\\alpha, \\zeta)$ basis are:\n$$g_{\\alpha\\alpha} = r^2$$\n$$g_{\\alpha\\zeta} = g_{\\zeta\\alpha} = \\frac{r^2}{q}$$\n$$g_{\\zeta\\zeta} = \\frac{r^2}{q^2} + (R_0+r\\cos\\theta)^2$$\nNote that the components depend on the geometric angle $\\theta$, which must be evaluated at the location of interest.\n\n**3. Interpolation Algorithm**\n\nFor a given query point $(\\theta_q, \\zeta_q)$, the interpolation weights are computed as follows:\n\n1.  **Coordinate Transformation**: The query point is transformed into the computational $(\\alpha, \\zeta)$ coordinates:\n    $$\\alpha_q = \\theta_q - \\zeta_q/q$$\n    $$\\zeta_q = \\zeta_q$$\n    These angles are then wrapped to the principal domain $[0, 2\\pi)$ using the modulo operation. Let the wrapped coordinates be $(\\alpha'_q, \\zeta'_q)$.\n\n2.  **Neighbor Identification**: The indices $(i_0, j_0)$ of the lower-left mesh node of the cell containing the query point are found by:\n    $$i_0 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\alpha'_q}{\\Delta\\alpha} \\right\\rfloor, \\quad j_0 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\zeta'_q}{\\Delta\\zeta} \\right\\rfloor$$\n    where $\\Delta\\alpha = 2\\pi/N_\\alpha$ and $\\Delta\\zeta = 2\\pi/N_\\zeta$ are the mesh spacings. The four surrounding cell corners are at indices $(i_0, j_0)$, $(i_0+1, j_0)$, $(i_0, j_0+1)$, and $(i_0+1, j_0+1)$, with indices taken modulo $N_\\alpha$ and $N_\\zeta$ respectively to handle periodicity.\n\n3.  **Distance Calculation**: The squared distance $d_k^2$ from the query point $(\\alpha'_q, \\zeta'_q)$ to each neighboring node $k$ at $(\\alpha_k, \\zeta_k)$ is computed using the quadratic form induced by the metric $g'_{(\\alpha,\\zeta)}$ evaluated at $\\theta_q$:\n    $$d_k^2 = g_{\\alpha\\alpha}(\\Delta\\alpha_k)^2 + 2 g_{\\alpha\\zeta}(\\Delta\\alpha_k)(\\Delta\\zeta_k) + g_{\\zeta\\zeta}(\\Delta\\zeta_k)^2$$\n    The displacements $(\\Delta\\alpha_k, \\Delta\\zeta_k) = (\\alpha'_q - \\alpha_k, \\zeta'_q - \\zeta_k)$ must be calculated as the shortest angle on the circle (principal value) to respect the periodic nature of the domain. For an angular difference $\\delta$, the principal value is $(\\delta + \\pi) \\pmod{2\\pi} - \\pi$, which lies in $(-\\pi, \\pi]$.\n\n4.  **Weight Computation**: The interpolation weights are determined using an inverse-distance scheme with exponent $p=1$. The unnormalized weight for node $k$ is $w'_k = 1/d_k$. These are then normalized to sum to unity:\n    $$w_k = \\frac{w'_k}{\\sum_{m} w'_m} = \\frac{1/d_k}{\\sum_{m} 1/d_m}$$\n    In the special case where a query point coincides with a mesh node (i.e., $d_k$ is below a small numerical tolerance), the weight for that node is set to $1$ and all other weights are set to $0$.\n\nThe resulting four weights, corresponding to the cell corners in the order [lower-left, lower-right, upper-left, upper-right], are then reported for each query point.",
