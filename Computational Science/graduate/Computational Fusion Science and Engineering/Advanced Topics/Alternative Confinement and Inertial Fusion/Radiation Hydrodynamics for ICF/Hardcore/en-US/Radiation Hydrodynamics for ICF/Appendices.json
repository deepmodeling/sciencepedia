The contribution from the boundary at $\\tau=T$ and deep layers is completely attenuated.\nTaking the limit of the final expression as $T/\\mu \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nI(0, \\mu) = \\lim_{T/\\mu \\to \\infty} \\left[ (B_{0} + \\beta \\mu) - (B_{0} + \\beta T + \\beta \\mu) \\exp(-T/\\mu) \\right]\n$$\nThe exponential term vanishes, and we are left with:\n$$\nI(0, \\mu) \\to B_{0} + \\beta \\mu\n$$\nThis result is independent of the total slab thickness $T$. Physically, this means the slab is so opaque that the observer at $\\tau=0$ cannot \"see\" the far boundary. The emergent radiation originates from layers near the surface. The expression $B_{0} + \\beta \\mu$ is equal to the source function $S(\\tau)$ evaluated at an optical depth of $\\tau = \\mu$. This is a well-known result called the Eddington-Barbier approximation, which states that the emergent intensity from an optically thick medium is approximately equal to the source function at a characteristic optical depth of unity along the line of sight (i.e., $\\tau_{slant} = \\tau/\\mu = 1$, which implies $\\tau=\\mu$).",

In one dimension, this requires that the fastest characteristic wave does not travel more than one grid cell, $\\Delta x$, in a single timestep, $\\Delta t$. The maximum characteristic speed, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}}$, for the Euler equations is the sum of the fluid speed magnitude, $|u|$, and the sound speed, $c_s$. The CFL condition, incorporating the given safety coefficient $C_{\\mathrm{CFL}}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{hydro}} \\le C_{\\mathrm{CFL}} \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}}} = C_{\\mathrm{CFL}} \\frac{\\Delta x}{|u| + c_s} $$\nWe are given the following values:\n- Hydrodynamic CFL safety coefficient: $C_{\\mathrm{CFL}} = 0.5$\n- Uniform mesh spacing: $\\Delta x = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Fluid speed magnitude: $|u| = 2.5 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n- Sound speed: $c_{s} = 3.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the inequality, we find the maximum stable hydrodynamic timestep:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}} = |u| + c_s = 2.5 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s} + 3.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s} = 5.5 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{hydro}} = 0.5 \\times \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{5.5 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{5.5 \\times 10^{5}}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 1.81818 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n\nSecond, we determine the radiation diffusion timestep constraint, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{rad}}$. The radiation transport is modeled as a diffusion process, governed by a parabolic partial differential equation of the form $\\frac{\\partial E_r}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla E_r)$. For an explicit forward-Euler time integration scheme with a standard second-order central difference in space for a $1$D problem, the stability condition is given by:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{rad}} \\le \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2D} $$\nThe problem specifies a safety coefficient $C_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, which modifies this constraint to:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{rad}} = C_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2D} $$\nThe diffusion coefficient, $D$, in the optically thick limit is given by $D = \\frac{c}{3 \\kappa_{R} \\rho}$. We must first calculate $D$ using the provided parameters:\n- Speed of light: $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n- Rosseland mean opacity: $\\kappa_{R} = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/kg}$\n- Mass density: $\\rho = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$\n- Radiation diffusion safety coefficient: $C_{\\mathrm{diff}} = 0.5$\n\nLet's calculate $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{c}{3 \\kappa_{R} \\rho} = \\frac{2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}}{3 \\times (0.5\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/kg}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^{3}})} = \\frac{2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}}{1.5 \\times 10^{3}}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} $$\n$$ D \\approx 1.99861639 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} $$\nNow we can compute the radiation timestep constraint:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{rad}} = 0.5 \\times \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2}{2 \\times (1.99861639 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s})} = \\frac{0.5 \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2})}{2 \\times (1.99861639 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s})} $$\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{rad}} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-12}}{3.99723278 \\times 10^{5}}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 5.0034608 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n\nFinally, the overall stable timestep $\\Delta t$ for the coupled explicit scheme is the minimum of the two individual constraints:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\min(\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{hydro}}, \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{rad}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta t = \\min(1.81818 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{s}, 5.0034608 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{s}) $$\nThe radiation diffusion timestep is significantly smaller, thus it is the limiting factor:\n$$ \\Delta t = 5.0034608 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in femtoseconds, where $1\\ \\mathrm{fs} = 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n$$ \\Delta t = (5.0034608 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{fs}}{10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{s}}\\right) = 5.0034608 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{fs} = 0.0050034608\\ \\mathrm{fs} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\Delta t \\approx 0.005003\\ \\mathrm{fs} $$\nThis extremely small timestep illustrates why explicit diffusion schemes become prohibitively expensive (stiff) in optically thick regimes, motivating the use of implicit methods for the radiation transport part of the calculation.",
