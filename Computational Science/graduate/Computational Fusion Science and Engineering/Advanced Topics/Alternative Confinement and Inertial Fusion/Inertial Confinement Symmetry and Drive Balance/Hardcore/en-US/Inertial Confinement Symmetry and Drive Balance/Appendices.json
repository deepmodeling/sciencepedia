            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the growth of a low-mode shape perturbation on an imploding spherical shell in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF), driven by a non-uniform ablation pressure. The analysis will be performed in three parts.\n\n### Part 1: Angular Dependence of Shell Acceleration\n\nWe begin with Newton's second law applied to a unit area of the shell. The net pressure accelerating the shell inward is the difference between the external ablation pressure $p_{a}(\\theta, t)$ and the internal pressure $p_{int}(t)$. The law states that the net force per unit area equals the areal mass density $\\Sigma(t)$ times the local normal acceleration $a_{s}(\\theta, t)$. We define acceleration to be positive for inward motion.\n\n$$\n\\Sigma(t) a_{s}(\\theta, t) = p_{a}(\\theta, t) - p_{int}(t)\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the form of the ablation pressure:\n$$\np_{a}(\\theta,t) = p_{0}(t)\\left[1 + \\epsilon\\,P_{2}(\\cos\\theta)\\right]\n$$\nThe internal pressure $p_{int}(t)$ is given as spherically symmetric. Substituting the pressure expression into Newton's second law gives:\n$$\na_{s}(\\theta, t) = \\frac{p_{0}(t)\\left[1 + \\epsilon\\,P_{2}(\\cos\\theta)\\right] - p_{int}(t)}{\\Sigma(t)}\n$$\n\nWe can separate this into a mean (spherically symmetric) component and a perturbed component. The mean acceleration, $a_{s,0}(t)$, is the spherical average of $a_{s}(\\theta, t)$. Since the spherical average of the Legendre polynomial $P_{l}(\\cos\\theta)$ is zero for $l  0$, the mean acceleration is obtained by setting the perturbed term to zero:\n$$\na_{s,0}(t) = \\frac{p_{0}(t) - p_{int}(t)}{\\Sigma(t)}\n$$\n\nThe full angularly dependent acceleration can now be expressed as:\n$$\na_{s}(\\theta, t) = \\frac{p_{0}(t) - p_{int}(t)}{\\Sigma(t)} + \\frac{p_{0}(t)\\epsilon\\,P_{2}(\\cos\\theta)}{\\Sigma(t)}\n$$\n$$\na_{s}(\\theta, t) = a_{s,0}(t) + \\frac{p_{0}(t)}{\\Sigma(t)}\\epsilon\\,P_{2}(\\cos\\theta)\n$$\n\nThe fractional variation of the acceleration relative to the mean is defined as $\\frac{a_{s}(\\theta, t) - a_{s,0}(t)}{a_{s,0}(t)}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta a_{s}}{a_{s,0}} = \\frac{a_{s}(\\theta, t) - a_{s,0}(t)}{a_{s,0}(t)} = \\frac{\\frac{p_{0}(t)}{\\Sigma(t)}\\epsilon\\,P_{2}(\\cos\\theta)}{a_{s,0}(t)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $a_{s,0}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta a_{s}}{a_{s,0}} = \\frac{\\frac{p_{0}(t)}{\\Sigma(t)}\\epsilon\\,P_{2}(\\cos\\theta)}{\\frac{p_{0}(t) - p_{int}(t)}{\\Sigma(t)}} = \\left(\\frac{p_{0}(t)}{p_{0}(t) - p_{int}(t)}\\right) \\epsilon\\,P_{2}(\\cos\\theta)\n$$\nThis is the angular dependence of the fractional variation in acceleration.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Shape Coefficient $a_{2}$\n\nThe position of the shell at a given polar angle $\\theta$ and time $t$ is denoted by $R(\\theta, t)$. The motion is purely radial, so the acceleration is $a_s(\\theta, t) = -\\ddot{R}(\\theta, t)$, where the double dot denotes the second time derivative.\n\nWe linearize the problem by decomposing the radius into a mean component $R_0(t)$ and a small perturbation $\\delta R(\\theta, t)$:\n$$\nR(\\theta, t) = R_0(t) + \\delta R(\\theta, t)\n$$\nThe perturbation is driven by the $P_2$ mode in the pressure, so we assume its shape also follows a $P_2$ dependence:\n$$\n\\delta R(\\theta, t) = \\delta R_2(t) P_2(\\cos \\theta)\n$$\nThe equation of motion is $\\ddot{R}(\\theta, t) = -a_s(\\theta, t)$. Applying the decomposition:\n$$\n\\ddot{R}_0(t) + \\delta\\ddot{R}_2(t)P_2(\\cos \\theta) = -a_{s,0}(t) - \\frac{p_{0}(t)}{\\Sigma(t)}\\epsilon\\,P_{2}(\\cos\\theta)\n$$\nEquating the coefficients of the basis functions (1 and $P_2(\\cos \\theta)$) gives two equations:\n1. Mean motion: $\\ddot{R}_0(t) = -a_{s,0}(t) = -\\frac{p_0(t) - p_{int}(t)}{\\Sigma(t)}$\n2. Perturbed motion: $\\delta\\ddot{R}_2(t) = -\\frac{p_0(t)\\epsilon}{\\Sigma(t)}$\n\nTo obtain a closed-form solution for $a_2$ in terms of only the convergence $C$ and $\\epsilon$, we must eliminate the dependence on the unspecified time-dependent functions $p_0(t)$, $p_{int}(t)$, and $\\Sigma(t)$. We note that during the acceleration phase of an ICF implosion, the ablation pressure is typically much larger than the internal fill pressure, i.e., $p_0(t) \\gg p_{int}(t)$. Under this standard and physically motivated approximation, the equation for the mean motion simplifies to $\\ddot{R}_0(t) \\approx -p_0(t)/\\Sigma(t)$.\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the equation for the perturbation:\n$$\n\\delta\\ddot{R}_2(t) \\approx \\left(\\ddot{R}_0(t)\\right) \\epsilon\n$$\nThis provides a direct relationship between the perturbed and mean kinematics, independent of the specific drive history. We now integrate this equation twice with respect to time from $t=0$ to a general time $t$. The initial conditions are that the shell starts from rest with a perfect spherical shape:\n- $R(\\theta, 0) = R_i \\implies R_0(0) = R_i$ and $\\delta R(\\theta, 0) = 0$, so $\\delta R_2(0) = 0$.\n- $\\dot{R}(\\theta, 0) = 0 \\implies \\dot{R}_0(0) = 0$ and $\\delta\\dot{R}(\\theta, 0) = 0$, so $\\delta\\dot{R}_2(0) = 0$.\n\nIntegrating $\\delta\\ddot{R}_2(t) = \\epsilon \\ddot{R}_0(t)$ once:\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\delta\\ddot{R}_2(\\tau)d\\tau = \\epsilon \\int_0^t \\ddot{R}_0(\\tau)d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\delta\\dot{R}_2(t) - \\delta\\dot{R}_2(0) = \\epsilon \\left( \\dot{R}_0(t) - \\dot{R}_0(0) \\right)\n$$\nApplying the initial conditions $\\delta\\dot{R}_2(0) = 0$ and $\\dot{R}_0(0) = 0$:\n$$\n\\delta\\dot{R}_2(t) = \\epsilon \\dot{R}_0(t)\n$$\nIntegrating a second time:\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\delta\\dot{R}_2(\\tau)d\\tau = \\epsilon \\int_0^t \\dot{R}_0(\\tau)d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\delta R_2(t) - \\delta R_2(0) = \\epsilon \\left( R_0(t) - R_0(0) \\right)\n$$\nApplying the initial conditions $\\delta R_2(0) = 0$ and $R_0(0) = R_i$:\n$$\n\\delta R_2(t) = \\epsilon \\left( R_0(t) - R_i \\right)\n$$\nThis relation holds for the entire acceleration phase. We evaluate it at the final time $t_f$. At this time, the mean radius is $R_0(t_f) = R_f$. The perturbation amplitude is given by the problem definition of the final shape: $R_f(\\theta) = R_f [1 + a_2 P_2(\\cos\\theta)]$. Comparing this with $R(t_f, \\theta) = R_0(t_f) + \\delta R_2(t_f)P_2(\\cos \\theta)$, we identify $\\delta R_2(t_f) = R_f a_2$.\n\nSubstituting these into our integrated kinematic relation at $t=t_f$:\n$$\nR_f a_2 = \\epsilon (R_f - R_i)\n$$\nSolving for $a_2$:\n$$\na_2 = \\epsilon \\frac{R_f - R_i}{R_f} = \\epsilon \\left(1 - \\frac{R_i}{R_f}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the definition of the convergence ratio $C = R_i/R_f$:\n$$\na_2 = \\epsilon(1-C)\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Evaluation for Given Parameters\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Initial radius: $R_i = 1.0~\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Final mean radius: $R_f = 0.2~\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Pressure mode amplitude: $\\epsilon = 0.01$\n\nFirst, we calculate the convergence ratio $C$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{R_i}{R_f} = \\frac{1.0}{0.2} = 5\n$$\nNow, we use the derived formula for $a_2$:\n$$\na_2 = \\epsilon(1-C) = 0.01 \\times (1 - 5) = 0.01 \\times (-4)\n$$\n$$\na_2 = -0.04\n$$\nThe value of $a_2$ is a dimensionless number representing the amplitude of the final shell shape distortion in units of the final radius. The negative sign indicates that for a pressure that is highest at the pole ($\\epsilon  0$), the shell moves inward fastest at the pole, resulting in a shape that is flattened (oblate) relative to the mean sphere, i.e., the radius at the pole is smaller than the mean radius.",

Let $x = \\cos\\theta$, so $dx = -\\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta$. The integration limits change from $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$ to $x \\in [1, -1]$.\n$$ \\int_0^\\pi P_4(\\cos\\theta) P_2(\\cos\\theta)^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta = \\int_1^{-1} P_4(x) P_2(x)^2 (-dx) = \\int_{-1}^1 P_4(x) P_2(x)^2 \\, dx $$\nSo, the expression for $K_{24}$ becomes:\n$$ K_{24} = \\frac{15}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{-1}^1 P_4(x) P_2(x)^2 \\, dx $$\nTo evaluate this integral, we first express the term $P_2(x)^2$ as a linear combination of other Legendre polynomials. From the Clebsch-Gordan series for products of Legendre polynomials, the product $P_2(x)P_2(x)$ can be expanded in terms of $P_L(x)$ where $L$ can be $0, 2, 4$. We write:\n$$ P_2(x)^2 = c_0 P_0(x) + c_2 P_2(x) + c_4 P_4(x) $$\nThe required Legendre polynomials are:\n$P_0(x) = 1$\n$P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1)$\n$P_4(x) = \\frac{1}{8}(35x^4 - 30x^2 + 3)$\nWe can compute $P_2(x)^2$:\n$$ P_2(x)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1)\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(9x^4 - 6x^2 + 1) $$\nBy equating the polynomial expression for $P_2(x)^2$ with its expansion and matching coefficients of powers of $x$:\n$\\frac{1}{4}(9x^4 - 6x^2 + 1) = c_4 \\left(\\frac{1}{8}(35x^4 - 30x^2 + 3)\\right) + c_2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1)\\right) + c_0(1)$\nMatching the coefficient of $x^4$:\n$$ \\frac{9}{4} = c_4 \\frac{35}{8} \\implies c_4 = \\frac{9}{4} \\cdot \\frac{8}{35} = \\frac{18}{35} $$\nThe full expansion is a standard result:\n$$ P_2(x)^2 = \\frac{18}{35} P_4(x) + \\frac{2}{7} P_2(x) + \\frac{1}{5} P_0(x) $$\nNow, we substitute this expansion into the integral:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^1 P_4(x) P_2(x)^2 \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^1 P_4(x) \\left( \\frac{18}{35} P_4(x) + \\frac{2}{7} P_2(x) + \\frac{1}{5} P_0(x) \\right) dx $$\nUsing the orthogonality property of Legendre polynomials, $\\int_{-1}^1 P_l(x) P_k(x) \\, dx = \\frac{2}{2l+1} \\delta_{lk}$:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^1 P_4(x) P_2(x)^2 \\, dx = \\frac{18}{35} \\int_{-1}^1 P_4(x)^2 \\, dx + \\frac{2}{7} \\int_{-1}^1 P_4(x)P_2(x) \\, dx + \\frac{1}{5} \\int_{-1}^1 P_4(x)P_0(x) \\, dx $$\nThe second and third integrals are zero because the indices are different. The first integral is:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^1 P_4(x)^2 \\, dx = \\frac{2}{2(4)+1} = \\frac{2}{9} $$\nSo the value of the integral is:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^1 P_4(x) P_2(x)^2 \\, dx = \\frac{18}{35} \\left( \\frac{2}{9} \\right) = \\frac{36}{315} = \\frac{4}{35} $$\nFinally, we substitute this result back into our expression for $K_{24}$:\n$$ K_{24} = \\frac{15}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left( \\frac{4}{35} \\right) $$\n$$ K_{24} = \\frac{15}{35\\sqrt{\\pi}} = \\frac{3}{7\\sqrt{\\pi}} $$\nThe fact that $K_{24}$ is non-zero analytically confirms that the quadratic self-coupling of the $\\ell=2$ mode generates a non-zero $\\ell=4$ component, demonstrating the principle of nonlinear mode mixing.",
