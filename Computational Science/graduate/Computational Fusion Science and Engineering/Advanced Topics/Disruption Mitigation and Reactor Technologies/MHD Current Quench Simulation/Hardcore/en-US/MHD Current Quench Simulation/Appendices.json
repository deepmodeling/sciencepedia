This is a standard, valid first-order approximation in plasma physics and magnetohydrodynamics for a current quench scenario without external drivers. The principles invoked—Maxwell-Faraday's law, Ohm's law, and the definition of inductance—are fundamental to electromagnetism. The given parameter values are physically plausible for a large tokamak.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is to solve a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with a given initial condition, which constitutes a well-posed initial value problem. It requests the calculation of specific, well-defined physical quantities ($V_\\mathrm{loop}(t)$ and dissipated energy) for which unique solutions exist.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard scientific terminology.\n4.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. All necessary parameters and assumptions (constant $L_p$ and $R_p$, no external voltage source) are provided. Faraday's law ($V_\\mathrm{loop} = -d\\Phi_p/dt$), Ohm's law ($V_\\mathrm{loop} = R_p I_p$), and the inductance definition ($\\Phi_p = L_p I_p$) combine consistently to form the governing differential equation.\n5.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: While the assumption of constant $R_p$ is a strong simplification (plasma resistivity is a strong function of temperature, which changes dramatically during a quench), it is a common and acceptable simplification for an analytical problem of this nature. It does not render the problem scientifically invalid, but rather defines the idealized physical system to be analyzed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided. I will proceed with the detailed solution.\n\nThe fundamental relationship governing the circuit is derived from Maxwell-Faraday's law, which states that the electromotive force (in this case, the toroidal loop voltage) induced in a closed loop is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop.\n$$V_\\mathrm{loop}(t) = -\\frac{d\\Phi_p(t)}{dt}$$\nThe problem provides two constitutive relations for the plasma:\n1.  The definition of poloidal flux in terms of the constant self-inductance $L_p$ and plasma current $I_p(t)$:\n    $$\\Phi_p(t) = L_p I_p(t)$$\n2.  The resistive MHD closure (Ohm's law for the plasma circuit):\n    $$V_\\mathrm{loop}(t) = R_p I_p(t)$$\nSubstituting these relations into Faraday's law yields the governing differential equation for the plasma current.\n$$R_p I_p(t) = -\\frac{d}{dt} [L_p I_p(t)]$$\nSince $L_p$ is assumed to be constant, we can write:\n$$R_p I_p(t) = -L_p \\frac{dI_p(t)}{dt}$$\nThis is a first-order, linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation, which can be rearranged as:\n$$L_p \\frac{dI_p}{dt} + R_p I_p = 0$$\nTo solve for $I_p(t)$, we use the method of separation of variables:\n$$\\frac{dI_p}{I_p} = -\\frac{R_p}{L_p} dt$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial time $t=0$ with current $I_p(0)=I_0$ to a generic time $t$ with current $I_p(t)$:\n$$\\int_{I_0}^{I_p(t)} \\frac{dI'_p}{I'_p} = -\\frac{R_p}{L_p} \\int_0^t dt'$$\n$$[\\ln|I'_p|]_{I_0}^{I_p(t)} = -\\frac{R_p}{L_p} [t']_0^t$$\n$$\\ln(I_p(t)) - \\ln(I_0) = -\\frac{R_p}{L_p} t$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I_p(t)}{I_0}\\right) = -\\frac{R_p}{L_p} t$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for the plasma current as a function of time:\n$$I_p(t) = I_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R_p}{L_p} t\\right)$$\nThis describes an exponential decay of the plasma current with a characteristic resistive time constant $\\tau_p = L_p/R_p$.\n\nFirst, we compute the explicit functional form of the loop voltage, $V_\\mathrm{loop}(t)$. Using the provided Ohm's law relation, $V_\\mathrm{loop}(t) = R_p I_p(t)$, and substituting the derived expression for $I_p(t)$:\n$$V_\\mathrm{loop}(t) = R_p I_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R_p}{L_p} t\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$L_p = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{H}$\n$R_p = 0.01\\,\\Omega$\n$I_0 = 5\\,\\mathrm{MA} = 5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n\nThe initial loop voltage at $t=0$ is $V_0 = R_p I_0$:\n$$V_0 = (0.01\\,\\Omega) \\times (5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{A}) = 50000\\,\\mathrm{V} = 5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe resistive time constant $\\tau_p$ is:\n$$\\tau_p = \\frac{L_p}{R_p} = \\frac{1.0\\,\\mathrm{H}}{0.01\\,\\Omega} = 100\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThus, the explicit functional form for the loop voltage in volts is:\n$$V_\\mathrm{loop}(t) = (5 \\times 10^4) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{100}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we compute the total ohmic energy dissipated, $W_{ohmic}$, as the plasma current decays from its initial value $I_0 = 5\\,\\mathrm{MA}$ to a final value $I_f = 1\\,\\mathrm{MA}$.\nThe instantaneous ohmic power dissipated in the plasma is given by $P(t) = V_\\mathrm{loop}(t) I_p(t) = R_p (I_p(t))^2$. The total energy dissipated is the time integral of this power.\n$$W_{ohmic} = \\int_{t_i}^{t_f} P(t) dt$$\nHowever, a more direct approach utilizes the principle of energy conservation. Since there is no external power source, the energy dissipated as heat through the resistance must equal the decrease in the magnetic energy stored in the inductor. The magnetic energy stored in the inductor is given by $W_M = \\frac{1}{2}L_p I_p^2$.\nThe initial stored magnetic energy at $t=0$ when $I_p = I_0$ is:\n$$W_{M,i} = \\frac{1}{2} L_p I_0^2$$\nThe final stored magnetic energy when $I_p = I_f$ is:\n$$W_{M,f} = \\frac{1}{2} L_p I_f^2$$\nThe total ohmic energy dissipated during this decay is the change in stored energy:\n$$W_{ohmic} = W_{M,i} - W_{M,f} = \\frac{1}{2} L_p I_0^2 - \\frac{1}{2} L_p I_f^2 = \\frac{1}{2} L_p (I_0^2 - I_f^2)$$\nWe now substitute the numerical values:\n$L_p = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{H}$\n$I_0 = 5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n$I_f = 1 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n$$W_{ohmic} = \\frac{1}{2} (1.0) \\left( (5 \\times 10^6)^2 - (1 \\times 10^6)^2 \\right)$$\n$$W_{ohmic} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 25 \\times 10^{12} - 1 \\times 10^{12} \\right)$$\n$$W_{ohmic} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 24 \\times 10^{12} \\right)$$\n$$W_{ohmic} = 12 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nIn standard scientific notation, this is $1.2 \\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\n\nThe two computed quantities are:\n1.

It is a valid problem in plasma physics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Criterion\n\nThe core of the problem is to establish the domain of validity for the $0$D $L\\!-\\!R$ circuit model, $V_{\\mathrm{loop}} = L\\, dI/dt + R\\, I$. This model describes the evolution of global quantities: the total plasma current $I(t)$, the total loop voltage $V_{\\mathrm{loop}}(t)$, a constant total inductance $L$, and a constant total resistance $R$. The use of single, constant scalar values for $L$ and $R$ implicitly assumes that the spatial distribution of the current density, $J(r,t)$, either remains constant in shape or is uniform across the plasma cross-section.\n\nIn contrast, the resistive MHD model describes the spatio-temporal evolution of the fields. The provided parabolic partial differential equation for the poloidal flux $\\psi$,\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = D_{\\eta} \\nabla^2 \\psi $$\n(where $D_{\\eta} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}/\\mu_0$ is the magnetic diffusivity and $\\nabla^2$ is the cylindrical Laplacian operator acting on $\\psi$), is a diffusion equation. This equation governs how changes in the magnetic field and current profile diffuse through the resistive plasma.\n\nThe fundamental question is: on what timescale does the current profile evolve? A current quench is characterized by a global decay time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}}$. Any change in boundary conditions (e.g., a drop in edge voltage) will propagate into the plasma via diffusion. The characteristic time for this diffusion to cross the entire plasma minor radius $a$ is the resistive time, $\\tau_R \\sim a^2/D_{\\eta} = \\mu_0 a^2/\\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The characteristic distance a diffusive perturbation penetrates in a time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}}$ is the skin depth, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}}$. We can derive this from dimensional analysis of the diffusion equation: $[\\partial/\\partial t] \\sim 1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}}$ and $[\\nabla^2] \\sim 1/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}}^2$. This gives $1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\sim D_{\\eta}/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}}^2$, leading to $\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}}^2 \\sim D_{\\eta} \\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}}/\\mu_0$, which matches the given definition.\n\nThe $L\\!-\\!R$ model is valid if the plasma responds globally and homogeneously to the quench. This requires that information about the perturbation has time to diffuse across the entire plasma column within the quench timescale. In other words, the penetration depth $\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}}$ must be large compared to the system size $a$.\n- **Validity Condition:** $\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\gtrsim a$. This means the plasma is \"transparen\" to the diffusive process on the timescale of the quench. The current profile can adjust globally, maintaining a broad shape, which is consistent with the assumptions of a $0$D model. This condition is equivalent to $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\lesssim 1$.\n\nThe $L\\!-\\!R$ model fails when spatial effects become dominant. This occurs when the quench is so rapid that the current profile does not have time to equilibrate across the radius.\n- **Breakdown Condition:** $\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\ll a$. In this limit, the current change is confined to a thin \"skin\" layer of thickness $\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}}$ at the plasma edge. The core of the plasma is shielded from the rapid changes. This leads to a highly non-uniform current profile with large gradients. These large gradients can trigger MHD instabilities like tearing modes, which cause magnetic reconnection and further accelerate the current redistribution in a complex, multi-dimensional way. The simple $L\\!-\\!R$ model, and even the simple $1$D diffusion model, cannot capture this. The breakdown regime begins when $\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}}$ becomes comparable to or smaller than $a$, i.e., $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n\nThis criterion can be expressed using the ratio of timescales, defined as $C \\equiv (a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}})^2$.\n$$ C = \\frac{a^2}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}}^2} = \\frac{a^2}{(\\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}}/\\mu_0)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 a^2}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}}} = \\frac{\\tau_R}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}}} $$\nThe $L\\!-\\!R$ model is valid when $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\lesssim 1$, which is equivalent to $C \\lesssim 1$, or $\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\gtrsim \\tau_R$. This means the quench is slow compared to the resistive diffusion time.\nThe model breaks down when $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\gtrsim 1$, which is equivalent to $C \\gtrsim 1$, or $\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\lesssim \\tau_R$. This means the quench is fast compared to the resistive diffusion time.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The $L\\!-\\!R$ model assumes spatially uniform electric field and current density across the minor radius and neglects profile diffusion and reconnection. It is therefore self-consistent only when $\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\gtrsim a$, equivalently $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\ll 1$. When $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(1)$, strong skin effects, steep current gradients, and possible reconnection events invalidate the $L\\!-\\!R$ assumptions, requiring resistive MHD.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes the physical basis of the $L\\!-\\!R$ model and its limitations. It correctly identifies that the model neglects spatial effects. It correctly states the validity condition as $\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\gtrsim a$, with the asymptotic limit being $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\ll 1$. It also correctly identifies the breakdown condition $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(1)$ and the associated physical phenomena (skin effect, gradients, reconnection) that necessitate a more sophisticated MHD model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because the circuit $L\\!-\\!R$ time is $L/R$, the correct skin depth for a current quench is $\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} = \\sqrt{2\\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(\\mu_0 \\omega)}$ with $\\omega \\equiv R/L$, and the $L\\!-\\!R$ model is valid when $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\gg 1$ (the skin effect confines current near the edge, so the interior behaves as an inductor).**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, the skin depth formula $\\delta = \\sqrt{2\\eta/(\\mu \\omega)}$ is for steady-state sinusoidal AC fields of frequency $\\omega$, not for a transient decay process characterized by a time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}}$. The appropriate definition for a diffusive transient is the one given in the problem, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} = \\sqrt{\\eta_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}}/\\mu_0}$. Second, and more critically, the condition for validity is stated as $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\gg 1$. This is the opposite of the correct condition. $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\gg 1$ signifies a very strong skin effect, where the $0$D model is guaranteed to fail. The reasoning provided is also flawed; if current is confined to the edge, the system's behavior is fundamentally different from that of a simple inductor with fixed $L$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. An equivalent non-dimensional criterion is $C \\equiv (a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}})^2 = \\tau_R/\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}}$. The $L\\!-\\!R$ model is asymptotically valid for $C \\ll 1$ (slow global changes relative to resistive diffusion), and breaks down for $C \\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(1)$; in the latter regime, spatial diffusion and reconnection can dominate profile evolution on the quench timescale.**\nThis statement correctly derives the relationship between the parameter $C$, the ratio $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}}$, and the ratio of timescales $\\tau_R/\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}}$. As shown in our derivation, $C = (a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}})^2 = \\tau_R/\\tau_{\\mathrm{CQ}}$.

It appears the option has calculated the reciprocal, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}}/a \\approx 0.2523 / 0.6 \\approx 0.4205$. Since the correct ratio is $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\approx 2.38 \\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(1)$, the condition for the $L\\!-\\!R$ model to be valid ($a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\lesssim 1$) is not met. Thus, the conclusion that the model \"remains acceptable\" is also incorrect based on these parameters.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Even when $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\gg 1$, a zero-dimensional model with time-dependent $L(t)$ and $R(t)$ can fully capture skin-effect-driven current redistribution and reconnection by using volume-averaged parameters, so a multi-dimensional resistive MHD treatment is not necessary.**\nThis statement is fundamentally false. The regime $a/\\delta_{\\mathrm{CQ}} \\gg 1$ is where spatial effects are maximally important. While one can define time-dependent global parameters $L(t)$ and $R(t)$ by integrating over a known, evolving current profile (obtained from an MHD simulation), a $0$D model cannot predictively compute those profiles. The $0$D model lacks the spatial degrees of freedom to describe phenomena like current redistribution. Furthermore, magnetic reconnection is an inherently topological and multi-dimensional process involving localized structures (current sheets) that cannot be described, let alone \"fully captured\", by volume-averaged scalar quantities. A multi-dimensional MHD treatment is precisely what is required in this regime.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
