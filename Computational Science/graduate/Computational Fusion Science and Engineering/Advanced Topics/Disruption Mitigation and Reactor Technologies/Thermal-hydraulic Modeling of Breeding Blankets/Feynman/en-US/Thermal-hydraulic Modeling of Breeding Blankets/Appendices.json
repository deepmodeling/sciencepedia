The temperature-dependent specific heat is a valid physical refinement. All necessary parameters are provided, and no contradictions are present. The values are physically realistic for a helium-cooled channel in a fusion blanket. The problem is therefore scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Outlet Temperature Expression**\n\nWe begin by applying the steady-state conservation of energy principle to a differential control volume of the channel. Let the axial coordinate along the channel length be $z$. Consider a slice of the channel of infinitesimal length $dz$ located at position $z$. The volume of this slice is $dV = W H dz$.\n\nThe energy balance for this differential control volume is:\n$$ \\dot{E}_{\\text{in}} + \\dot{E}_{\\text{gen}} = \\dot{E}_{\\text{out}} $$\nwhere $\\dot{E}_{\\text{in}}$ is the rate of energy entering the control volume by convection, $\\dot{E}_{\\text{gen}}$ is the rate of energy generated within the volume, and $\\dot{E}_{\\text{out}}$ is the rate of energy leaving by convection.\n\nLet $T(z)$ be the bulk fluid temperature at position $z$. The rate of enthalpy transport by a mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ is $\\dot{m} h(T)$, where $h(T)$ is the specific enthalpy.\nThe energy balance can be written as:\n$$ \\dot{m} h(z) + q''' (W H dz) = \\dot{m} h(z+dz) $$\nwhere $h(z)$ is the specific enthalpy at temperature $T(z)$.\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$ \\dot{m} [h(z+dz) - h(z)] = q''' W H dz $$\nDividing by $dz$ and applying the definition of the derivative:\n$$ \\dot{m} \\frac{dh}{dz} = q''' W H $$\nThe change in specific enthalpy $dh$ is related to the specific heat capacity $c_p$ and the change in temperature $dT$ by $dh = c_p(T) dT$, as pressure work is negligible.\nSubstituting this into the energy equation:\n$$ \\dot{m} c_p(T) \\frac{dT}{dz} = q''' W H $$\nWe are given that $c_p(T) = c_0 + c_1 T$. Substituting this expression:\n$$ \\dot{m} (c_0 + c_1 T) \\frac{dT}{dz} = q''' W H $$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation. We can separate the variables $T$ and $z$:\n$$ (c_0 + c_1 T) dT = \\frac{q''' W H}{\\dot{m}} dz $$\nTo find the outlet temperature $T_{\\text{out}}$, we integrate this equation along the entire length of the channel. The temperature changes from $T_{\\text{in}}$ at $z=0$ to $T_{\\text{out}}$ at $z=L$.\n$$ \\int_{T_{\\text{in}}}^{T_{\\text{out}}} (c_0 + c_1 T) dT = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{q''' W H}{\\dot{m}} dz $$\nThe right-hand side is an integral of a constant, which evaluates to:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{q''' W H}{\\dot{m}} dz = \\frac{q''' W H L}{\\dot{m}} $$\nThe left-hand side is the integral of the temperature-dependent specific heat term:\n$$ \\int_{T_{\\text{in}}}^{T_{\\text{out}}} (c_0 + c_1 T) dT = \\left[ c_0 T + \\frac{1}{2} c_1 T^2 \\right]_{T_{\\text{in}}}^{T_{\\text{out}}} $$\n$$ = \\left( c_0 T_{\\text{out}} + \\frac{1}{2} c_1 T_{\\text{out}}^2 \\right) - \\left( c_0 T_{\\text{in}} + \\frac{1}{2} c_1 T_{\\text{in}}^2 \\right) $$\nEquating the two integrated expressions:\n$$ c_0 T_{\\text{out}} + \\frac{1}{2} c_1 T_{\\text{out}}^2 - c_0 T_{\\text{in}} - \\frac{1}{2} c_1 T_{\\text{in}}^2 = \\frac{q''' W H L}{\\dot{m}} $$\nThis equation is a quadratic equation for the unknown outlet temperature $T_{\\text{out}}$. We can write it in the standard form $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$, where $x = T_{\\text{out}}$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{2} c_1\\right) T_{\\text{out}}^2 + (c_0) T_{\\text{out}} - \\left( c_0 T_{\\text{in}} + \\frac{1}{2} c_1 T_{\\text{in}}^2 + \\frac{q''' W H L}{\\dot{m}} \\right) = 0 $$\nThe solution for $T_{\\text{out}}$ is given by the quadratic formula, $T_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ T_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{-c_0 \\pm \\sqrt{c_0^2 - 4 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} c_1\\right) \\left[ - \\left( c_0 T_{\\text{in}} + \\frac{1}{2} c_1 T_{\\text{in}}^2 + \\frac{q''' W H L}{\\dot{m}} \\right) \\right]}}{2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} c_1\\right)} $$\n$$ T_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{-c_0 \\pm \\sqrt{c_0^2 + 2 c_1 \\left( c_0 T_{\\text{in}} + \\frac{1}{2} c_1 T_{\\text{in}}^2 + \\frac{q''' W H L}{\\dot{m}} \\right)}}{c_1} $$\nSimplifying the term under the square root:\n$$ c_0^2 + 2 c_1 c_0 T_{\\text{in}} + c_1^2 T_{\\text{in}}^2 + \\frac{2 c_1 q''' W H L}{\\dot{m}} = (c_0 + c_1 T_{\\text{in}})^2 + \\frac{2 c_1 q''' W H L}{\\dot{m}} $$\nSo the expression for $T_{\\text{out}}$ becomes:\n$$ T_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{-c_0 \\pm \\sqrt{(c_0 + c_1 T_{\\text{in}})^2 + \\frac{2 c_1 q''' W H L}{\\dot{m}}}}{c_1} $$\nSince temperature must be positive and we expect $T_{\\text{out}} > T_{\\text{in}}$, we must choose the positive root. The negative root would yield a physically meaningless negative temperature.\nThe final analytical expression for the outlet temperature is:\n$$ T_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{-c_0 + \\sqrt{(c_0 + c_1 T_{\\text{in}})^2 + \\frac{2 c_1 q''' W H L}{\\dot{m}}}}{c_1} $$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into the derived expression.

It is a standard exercise in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scale analysis, relevant to the field of computational fusion science. Therefore, the problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to find the dimensionless ratio $R = f_{L}/f_{\\nu}$, where $f_{L}$ is the magnitude of the Lorentz force density and $f_{\\nu}$ is the magnitude of the viscous force density. This requires performing a scale analysis on the relevant terms of the governing equations.\n\nFirst, we estimate the scale of the Lorentz force density, $f_{L} \\sim \\|\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\|$. The magnitude scales as $f_{L} \\sim J B$, where $J$ is the characteristic magnitude of the electric current density $\\mathbf{J}$ and $B$ is the magnitude of the imposed magnetic field. To find the scale of $J$, we analyze Ohm's law for a moving conductor, $\\mathbf{J}=\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{U}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\right)$, in conjunction with the quasi-static constraint of a solenoidal current density, $\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{J}=0$.\n\nIn the quasi-static limit, the electric field is irrotational ($\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}=0$) and can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar electric potential, $\\phi$, such that $\\mathbf{E}=-\\nabla\\phi$.

The momentum equation (Navier-Stokes) is:\n$$\n\\rho (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, $p$ is the pressure, $\\mu = \\rho\\nu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\\mathbf{J}$ is the electric current density.\n\nThe flow is steady ($\\partial/\\partial t = 0$) and fully developed, meaning the velocity profile is independent of the axial coordinate $x$. Given the geometry, the velocity is only in the $x$-direction and varies only with $z$: $\\mathbf{u} = u(z) \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$. The condition of incompressibility, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$, is automatically satisfied as $\\partial u/\\partial x = 0$. The convective acceleration term $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = (u(z)\\partial/\\partial x) (u(z)\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}) = 0$. Side-wall effects are negligible, so we assume $\\partial/\\partial y = 0$ for all quantities.\n\nThe momentum equation simplifies. For the $x$-component:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu \\frac{d^2 u}{d z^2} + (\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B})_x\n$$\nThe pressure gradient $\\partial p/\\partial x$ is given as a uniform constant. Let's define $G = -\\partial p/\\partial x$.\n\nTo find the Lorentz force $\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}$, we first need the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ from Ohm's law in the quasi-static limit:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe magnetic field is $\\mathbf{B} = B \\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$. The motional electromotive force is $\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B} = (u(z)\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}) \\times (B\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}) = -u(z) B \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}$.\n\nFor the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$, we use Maxwell's equations. From Faraday's law in the steady state, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = 0$, which implies $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\phi$ for some electric potential $\\phi$. From charge conservation, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$. Substituting Ohm's law into this gives $\\sigma \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}) = 0$, which leads to $\\nabla^2\\phi = \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B})$.\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-u(z)B) = 0\n$$\nSo, we must solve Laplace's equation for the potential, $\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0$. With $\\partial/\\partial x = \\partial/\\partial y = 0$, this becomes $d^2\\phi/dz^2 = 0$, so $\\phi(z) = C_1 z + C_2$. The walls at $z=\\pm a$ are electrically insulating, meaning the normal component of the current, $J_z$, must be zero at the walls.\n$$\nJ_z = \\sigma (E_z + (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B})_z) = \\sigma E_z = -\\sigma \\frac{d\\phi}{dz} = -\\sigma C_1\n$$\nThe condition $J_z(\\pm a)=0$ requires $C_1=0$. This means $\\phi$ is a constant, and thus the electric field $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\phi = 0$. This condition corresponds to an open circuit in the transverse ($y$) direction, which is appropriate for an infinitely wide duct.\n\nWith $\\mathbf{E}=0$, Ohm's law simplifies to $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}) = -\\sigma u(z) B \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}$. The Lorentz force is then:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B} = (-\\sigma u(z) B \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}) \\times (B\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}) = -\\sigma B^2 u(z) \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the $x$-momentum equation:\n$$\n0 = G + \\mu \\frac{d^2 u}{d z^2} - \\sigma B^2 u(z)\n$$\nRearranging gives the governing ordinary differential equation for $u(z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u}{d z^2} - \\frac{\\sigma B^2}{\\mu} u(z) = -\\frac{G}{\\mu}\n$$\nUsing the definitions $\\mu = \\rho\\nu$ and the Hartmann number $Ha = B a \\sqrt{\\sigma/(\\rho\\nu)} = B a \\sqrt{\\sigma/\\mu}$, we can write the coefficient as $\\frac{\\sigma B^2}{\\mu} = \\frac{Ha^2}{a^2}$. The ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u}{d z^2} - \\frac{Ha^2}{a^2} u(z) = -\\frac{G}{\\mu}\n$$\nThe general solution is the sum of a homogeneous solution $u_h$ and a particular solution $u_p$. The homogeneous equation is $u_h'' - (Ha/a)^2 u_h = 0$, with solution $u_h(z) = C_1 \\cosh(Ha \\cdot z/a) + C_2 \\sinh(Ha \\cdot z/a)$. The particular solution is a constant, $u_p = (G/\\mu) / (Ha^2/a^2) = Ga^2/(\\mu Ha^2) = G/(\\sigma B^2)$.\nThe full solution is $u(z) = C_1 \\cosh(Ha \\cdot z/a) + C_2 \\sinh(Ha \\cdot z/a) + G/(\\sigma B^2)$.\nThe boundary conditions are no-slip at the walls: $u(a)=0$ and $u(-a)=0$. The flow is symmetric about $z=0$, so $u(z)=u(-z)$, which requires $C_2=0$. Applying $u(a)=0$:\n$$\n0 = C_1 \\cosh(Ha) + \\frac{G}{\\sigma B^2} \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{G}{\\sigma B^2 \\cosh(Ha)}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ gives the final velocity profile:\n$$\nu(z) = \\frac{G}{\\sigma B^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\cosh(Ha \\cdot z/a)}{\\cosh(Ha)}\\right)\n$$\n\n### Calculation of Volumetric Flow Fractions\nThe total volumetric flow rate per unit width, $Q_{tot}$, is the integral of $u(z)$ from $z=-a$ to $z=a$:\n$$\nQ_{tot} = \\int_{-a}^{a} u(z) dz = \\frac{G}{\\sigma B^2} \\int_{-a}^{a} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\cosh(Ha \\cdot z/a)}{\\cosh(Ha)}\\right) dz\n$$\n$$\nQ_{tot} = \\frac{G}{\\sigma B^2} \\left[ z - \\frac{a}{Ha \\cosh(Ha)} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{Ha \\cdot z}{a}\\right) \\right]_{-a}^{a} = \\frac{G}{\\sigma B^2} \\left( 2a - \\frac{2a}{Ha} \\frac{\\sinh(Ha)}{\\cosh(Ha)} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ_{tot} = \\frac{2aG}{\\sigma B^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\tanh(Ha)}{Ha} \\right)\n$$\nThe core region is defined by $|z| \\le a - \\delta_H = a(1-1/Ha)$. The volumetric flow rate in the core, $Q_{core}$, is:\n$$\nQ_{core} = \\int_{-a(1-1/Ha)}^{a(1-1/Ha)} u(z) dz = 2 \\int_{0}^{a(1-1/Ha)} u(z) dz\n$$\n$$\nQ_{core} = 2 \\frac{G}{\\sigma B^2} \\left[ z - \\frac{a}{Ha \\cosh(Ha)} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{Ha \\cdot z}{a}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{a(1-1/Ha)}\n$$\n$$\nQ_{core} = \\frac{2G}{\\sigma B^2} \\left( a\\left(1-\\frac{1}{Ha}\\right) - \\frac{a}{Ha \\cosh(Ha)} \\sinh\\left(Ha\\left(1-\\frac{1}{Ha}\\right)\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ_{core} = \\frac{2aG}{\\sigma B^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{Ha} - \\frac{\\sinh(Ha - 1)}{Ha \\cosh(Ha)} \\right)\n$$\nThe fraction of the flow in the core, $f_{core}$, is the ratio $Q_{core}/Q_{tot}$:\n$$\nf_{core} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{Ha} - \\frac{\\sinh(Ha-1)}{Ha \\cosh(Ha)}}{1 - \\frac{\\tanh(Ha)}{Ha}} = \\frac{Ha - 1 - \\frac{\\sinh(Ha-1)}{\\cosh(Ha)}}{Ha - \\tanh(Ha)}\n$$\nThe fraction of the flow in the Hartmann boundary layers, $f_{BL}$, is simply $1 - f_{core}$.\n\n### Evaluation at $Ha=100$\nWe now evaluate the fractions for $Ha=100$.\n$$\nf_{core} = \\frac{100 - 1 - \\frac{\\sinh(99)}{\\cosh(100)}}{100 - \\tanh(100)}\n$$\nFor $Ha=100$, $\\tanh(100)$ is extremely close to $1$, and the hyperbolic functions are very large. Using high-precision computation:\n$\\tanh(100) \\approx 1.0$\n$\\cosh(100) \\approx 1.3444... \\times 10^{43}$\n$\\sinh(99) \\approx 4.9458... \\times 10^{42}$\nThe fraction $\\sinh(99)/\\cosh(100) \\approx e^{-1} \\approx 0.367879$.\nWe compute the values:\n$$\nf_{core} = \\frac{99 - \\frac{\\sinh(99)}{\\cosh(100)}}{100 - \\tanh(100)} \\approx 0.996284046\n$$\n$$\nf_{BL} = 1 - f_{core} \\approx 1 - 0.996284046 = 0.003715954\n$$\nRounding these two values to six significant figures gives $f_{core} \\approx 0.996284$ and $f_{BL} \\approx 0.00371595$. The result is to be expressed as a row vector $(\\text{core}, \\text{boundary layers})$.",
