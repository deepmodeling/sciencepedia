We seek a function $\\mu(t)$ such that when we multiply the equation by it, the left-hand side becomes the derivative of a product. The integrating factor for an equation of the form $y' + p(t)y = q(t)$ is $\\mu(t) = e^{\\int p(t) dt}$.

This requires an analysis of two distinct cases for $\\alpha$.\n\nCase 1: $\\alpha \\neq 0$\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( W(t) e^{\\alpha t} \\right) dt = \\int P_0 e^{\\alpha t} dt\n$$\n$$\nW(t) e^{\\alpha t} = \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha} e^{\\alpha t} + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. To find $W(t)$, we multiply by $e^{-\\alpha t}$:\n$$\nW(t) = \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha} + C e^{-\\alpha t}\n$$\nWe apply the initial condition $W(0) = W_0$ to determine $C$:\n$$\nW_0 = W(0) = \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha} + C e^{0} = \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha} + C\n$$\nThis gives $C = W_0 - \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha}$. Substituting this back into the general solution yields the final analytic solution for $\\alpha \\neq 0$:\n$$\nW(t) = \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha} + \\left( W_0 - \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha} \\right) e^{-\\alpha t}\n$$\n\nCase 2: $\\alpha = 0$\nIf $\\alpha = 0$, the original ODE simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dW}{dt} = P_0\n$$\nThis is solved by direct integration:\n$$\n\\int dW = \\int P_0 dt\n$$\n$$\nW(t) = P_0 t + C'\n$$\nwhere $C'$ is the integration constant. Applying the initial condition $W(0) = W_0$:\n$$\nW_0 = W(0) = P_0(0) + C' \\implies C' = W_0\n$$\nThus, the analytic solution for $\\alpha = 0$ is:\n$$\nW(t) = W_0 + P_0 t\n$$\n\n**3. Numerical Solution: Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4) Method**\n\nThe ODE is of the form $dW/dt = f(t, W)$, where $f(t, W) = P_0 - \\alpha W$. We define a uniform time grid $t_n = n \\Delta t$ for $n=0, 1, 2, ...$ where $\\Delta t$ is the constant time step. The RK4 method iteratively calculates the numerical solution $W_{n+1}$ at time $t_{n+1}$ from the solution $W_n$ at time $t_n$ as follows:\n$$\nW_{n+1} = W_n + \\frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)\n$$\nThe intermediate quantities $k_i$ are given by:\n$$\nk_1 = \\Delta t \\cdot f(t_n, W_n) = \\Delta t (P_0 - \\alpha W_n)\n$$\n$$\nk_2 = \\Delta t \\cdot f(t_n + \\Delta t/2, W_n + k_1/2) = \\Delta t (P_0 - \\alpha(W_n + k_1/2))\n$$\n$$\nk_3 = \\Delta t \\cdot f(t_n + \\Delta t/2, W_n + k_2/2) = \\Delta t (P_0 - \\alpha(W_n + k_2/2))\n$$\n$$\nk_4 = \\Delta t \\cdot f(t_n + \\Delta t, W_n + k_3) = \\Delta t (P_0 - \\alpha(W_n + k_3))\n$$\nStarting with $W_0$ at $t_0=0$, this scheme is applied iteratively to generate the numerical solution across the time grid up to the final time $T$.\n\n**4. Benchmark Procedure**\n\nFor each test case, the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  A uniform time grid $t_{\\text{grid}}$ is established from $t=0$ to $t=T$ with a step size of $\\Delta t$. The number of steps is $N = T/\\Delta t$.\n2.  The analytic solution $W_{\\text{analytic}}$ is computed at each point on $t_{\\text{grid}}$ using the appropriate formula derived above.\n3.  The numerical solution $W_{\\text{numeric}}$ is computed by initializing with $W_0$ and iterating the RK4 scheme $N$ times.\n4.  The absolute deviation between the two solutions is calculated at each grid point: $E(t) = |W_{\\text{analytic}}(t) - W_{\\text{numeric}}(t)|$.\n5.  The maximum value of this deviation over the entire grid, $E_{\\max} = \\max(E(t))$, is found and reported as the result for the test case, rounded to six decimal places.",
