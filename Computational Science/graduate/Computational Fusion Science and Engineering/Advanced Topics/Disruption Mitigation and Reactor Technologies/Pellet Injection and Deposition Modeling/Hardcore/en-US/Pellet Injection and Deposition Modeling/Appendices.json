Therefore, the problem is **valid**.

The $x$-axis is horizontal, and the $y$-axis is vertical (positive upwards). The gravitational acceleration vector is $\\vec{g} = (0, -g)$. The initial velocity vector of the pellet is $\\vec{v}_p$, with magnitude $v_p$ and direction $\\theta$ above the horizontal. The components of the initial velocity are:\n$$\nv_{p,x} = v_p \\cos\\theta\n$$\n$$\nv_{p,y} = v_p \\sin\\theta\n$$\n\nThe motion of the pellet is governed by Newton's second law. Since only gravity acts on the pellet, the equations of motion for its position $(x(t), y(t))$ as a function of time $t$ are:\n$$\nx(t) = v_{p,x} t = (v_p \\cos\\theta) t\n$$\n$$\ny(t) = v_{p,y} t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 = (v_p \\sin\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\n$$\n\nThe problem requires us to find the vertical deviation at the moment the pellet has traveled a horizontal distance $d$. We first calculate the time of flight, $t_f$, required to cover this horizontal distance.\n$$\nd = x(t_f) = (v_p \\cos\\theta) t_f\n$$\nSolving for $t_f$:\n$$\nt_f = \\frac{d}{v_p \\cos\\theta}\n$$\n\nNext, we identify the two trajectories of interest.\n1. The **ideal trajectory** is a straight line, representing the path the pellet would take in the absence of gravity ($g=0$). Its vertical position is given by:\n$$\ny_{ideal}(t) = (v_p \\sin\\theta) t\n$$\nAt time $t_f$, this position is $y_{ideal}(t_f) = (v_p \\sin\\theta) t_f$.\n\n2. The **actual trajectory** is parabolic, under the influence of gravity. Its vertical position is given by the kinematic equation:\n$$\ny_{actual}(t) = (v_p \\sin\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\n$$\nAt time $t_f$, this position is $y_{actual}(t_f) = (v_p \\sin\\theta) t_f - \\frac{1}{2} g t_f^2$.\n\nThe vertical deviation, $\\Delta y$, is the difference between the ideal and actual vertical positions at time $t_f$.\n$$\n\\Delta y = y_{ideal}(t_f) - y_{actual}(t_f)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta y = \\left( (v_p \\sin\\theta) t_f \\right) - \\left( (v_p \\sin\\theta) t_f - \\frac{1}{2} g t_f^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta y = \\frac{1}{2} g t_f^2\n$$\nThis is the well-known result for the vertical distance an object falls from rest in time $t_f$.

No scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities are present. The numerical values are physically realistic for a contemporary large tokamak.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe motion of a charged particle's guiding center in a non-uniform magnetic field is subject to several drifts. The problem states that the E$\\times$B drift is negligible and focuses on the drifts arising from the magnetic field's spatial variation: the gradient drift ($\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B}$) and the curvature drift ($\\mathbf{v}_R$).\n\nThe well-established formula for the magnetic gradient drift is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} = \\frac{\\mu}{q} \\frac{\\mathbf{B} \\times \\nabla B}{B^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu = \\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\perp}^2 / B$ is the magnetic moment of the gyrating particle.

A more useful form uses the curvature vector $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = (\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{B}/B$ is the unit vector along the field. For a low-beta plasma, as is implicit here, it can be shown that the curvature of the field lines is related to the perpendicular gradient of the field strength, $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\approx \\frac{\\nabla_{\\perp} B}{B}$. Here, $\\nabla_{\\perp} B$ is the component of $\\nabla B$ perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$. The problem states $\\nabla B$ is purely radial ($\\hat{\\mathbf{R}}$), which is perpendicular to the toroidal field ($\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}$), so $\\nabla B = \\nabla_{\\perp} B$. The curvature drift can thus be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_R \\approx \\frac{m v_{\\parallel}^2}{q B} (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\kappa}) = \\frac{m v_{\\parallel}^2}{q B} \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{B} \\times \\frac{\\nabla B}{B}\\right) = \\frac{m v_{\\parallel}^2}{q} \\frac{\\mathbf{B} \\times \\nabla B}{B^3}\n$$\nThe combined drift velocity, $\\mathbf{v}_d$, is the sum of the gradient and curvature drifts:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_d = \\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} + \\mathbf{v}_R = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2q} \\frac{\\mathbf{B} \\times \\nabla B}{B^3} + \\frac{m v_{\\parallel}^2}{q} \\frac{\\mathbf{B} \\times \\nabla B}{B^3}\n$$\nCombining the terms, we arrive at the general expression for the combined drift:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_d = \\frac{m}{q} \\left( v_{\\parallel}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} v_{\\perp}^2 \\right) \\frac{\\mathbf{B} \\times \\nabla B}{B^3}\n$$\nNext, we specialize this result to the given tokamak geometry at the outboard midplane, near $R \\approx R_0$. We adopt a standard right-handed cylindrical coordinate system $(R, \\phi, Z)$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{R}}$ is the radial direction outward from the machine's axis of symmetry, $\\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}$ is the vertical direction, and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}$ is the toroidal direction. In this system, the cross product rule is $\\hat{\\mathbf{R}} \\times \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}$, which implies $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{R}} = -\\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}$. The problem provides:\n-   Magnetic field vector: $\\mathbf{B} \\approx B_0 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}$\n-   Magnetic field gradient vector: $\\nabla B \\approx -\\frac{B_0}{R_0} \\hat{\\mathbf{R}}$\n\nWe compute the cross product $\\mathbf{B} \\times \\nabla B$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B} \\times \\nabla B \\approx (B_0 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}) \\times \\left(-\\frac{B_0}{R_0} \\hat{\\mathbf{R}}\\right) = -\\frac{B_0^2}{R_0} (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{R}}) = -\\frac{B_0^2}{R_0} (-\\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}) = \\frac{B_0^2}{R_0} \\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}\n$$\nSubstituting this result and $B \\approx B_0$ into the combined drift velocity equation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_d \\approx \\frac{m}{q} \\left( v_{\\parallel}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} v_{\\perp}^2 \\right) \\frac{1}{B_0^3} \\left( \\frac{B_0^2}{R_0} \\hat{\\mathbf{Z}} \\right) = \\frac{m}{q B_0 R_0} \\left( v_{\\parallel}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} v_{\\perp}^2 \\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}\n$$\nThe vertical component of this velocity, which we can denote $v_{d,z}$, is the scalar coefficient of the unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}$:\n$$\nv_{d,z} = \\frac{m}{q B_0 R_0} \\left( v_{\\parallel}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} v_{\\perp}^2 \\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of this speed. Since $m$, $B_0$, $R_0$, and the velocity-squared term are all positive, the sign is determined by the charge $q$. For a positive ion ($q > 0$), the drift is upward ($+\\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}$). The magnitude is the absolute value, which in this case is the expression itself, thus demonstrating the required result.\n\nFinally, we compute the net vertical offset $\\Delta z$ using the provided numerical parameters.\nFirst, we calculate the vertical drift speed $v_{d,z}$:\n$$\nv_{\\parallel}^2 = (4.0 \\times 10^5)^2 = 1.6 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}^2\n$$\n$$\nv_{\\perp}^2 = (3.0 \\times 10^5)^2 = 0.9 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}^2\n$$\n$$\nv_{\\parallel}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} v_{\\perp}^2 = (1.6 \\times 10^{11}) + \\frac{1}{2}(0.9 \\times 10^{11}) = 1.6 \\times 10^{11} + 0.45 \\times 10^{11} = 2.05 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}^2\n$$\nNow, substitute all values into the expression for $v_{d,z}$:\n$$\nv_{d,z} = \\frac{(3.344 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg})}{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})} \\frac{(2.05 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}^2)}{(5.0\\,\\mathrm{T})(3.0\\,\\mathrm{m})}\n$$\n$$\nv_{d,z} = \\frac{(3.344 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (2.05 \\times 10^{11})}{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times (15.0)} \\, \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n$$\nv_{d,z} = \\frac{6.8552 \\times 10^{-16}}{2.403 \\times 10^{-18}} \\, \\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 285.277 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\nThe vertical displacement $\\Delta z$ is approximated by the product of this constant drift velocity and the time interval $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\Delta z \\approx v_{d,z} \\times \\tau = (285.277 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta z \\approx 0.01426385 \\, \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta z \\approx 0.0143 \\, \\mathrm{m}\n$$",
