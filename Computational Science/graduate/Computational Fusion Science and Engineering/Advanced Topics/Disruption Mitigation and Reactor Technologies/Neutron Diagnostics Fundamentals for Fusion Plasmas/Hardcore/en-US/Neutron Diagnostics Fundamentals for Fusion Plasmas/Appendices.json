The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of two quantities: the total DT neutron emission rate from the plasma, and the neutron flux incident on the detector.\n\n**1. Total DT Neutron Emission Rate ($Y_n$)**\n\nThe derivation starts from the microscopic definition of the binary reaction rate density, $R$, for two distinct reacting Maxwellian ion species, deuterium (D) and tritium (T). The reaction rate density is the number of reactions per unit volume per unit time. For distinct species, this is given by the product of their number densities and their thermally averaged fusion reactivity:\n$$R = n_{D} n_{T} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{DT}}$$\nThe problem states that the plasma is spatially uniform. This implies that the densities $n_{D}$ and $n_{T}$, as well as the ion temperature $T_i$ (which determines $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{DT}}$), are constant throughout the plasma volume $V$.\n\nThe total fusion reaction rate, $Y_{\\mathrm{fus}}$, is obtained by integrating the reaction rate density $R$ over the entire plasma volume $V$:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{fus}} = \\int_{V} R \\, dV$$\nSince $R$ is constant throughout the volume, the integral simplifies to the product of the reaction rate density and the total volume:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{fus}} = R \\cdot V = n_{D} n_{T} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{DT}} V$$\nThe problem states that each DT fusion reaction produces exactly one neutron. Therefore, the total neutron emission rate, $Y_n$, is equal to the total fusion reaction rate, $Y_{\\mathrm{fus}}$.\n$$Y_n = n_{D} n_{T} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{DT}} V$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the given values:\n$n_{D} = 5 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n$n_{T} = 5 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n$\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{DT}} = 1.1 \\times 10^{-22}\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}\\ s^{-1}}$\n$V = 100\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $Y_n$:\n$$Y_n = (5 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\times (1.1 \\times 10^{-22}\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}\\ s^{-1}}) \\times (100\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}})$$\n$$Y_n = (25 \\times 10^{38}) \\times (1.1 \\times 10^{-22}) \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$Y_n = 27.5 \\times 10^{38 - 22 + 2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$Y_n = 27.5 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$Y_n = 2.75 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n\n**2. Neutron Flux at the Detector ($\\phi_n$)**\n\nThe derivation for the neutron flux, $\\phi_n$, starts from the geometric conservation of particle number for an isotropic point source. The problem states that neutron emission is isotropic, and the detector is located at a distance $r$ from the plasma center, which allows us to model the entire plasma volume as a point source of neutrons.\n\nThe total number of neutrons emitted per second, $Y_n$, spreads out uniformly in all directions. At a distance $r$ from the source, these neutrons are distributed over the surface of a sphere of radius $r$. The surface area of this sphere is $A = 4 \\pi r^2$.\n\nThe neutron flux, $\\phi_n$, is defined as the number of neutrons passing through a unit area per unit time. Assuming no attenuation (as stated in the problem), the flux at distance $r$ is the total emission rate divided by the surface area of the sphere:\n$$\\phi_n = \\frac{Y_n}{A} = \\frac{Y_n}{4 \\pi r^2}$$\nThis is the second required expression. By substituting the expression for $Y_n$, we can write the flux in terms of the primary plasma parameters:\n$$\\phi_n = \\frac{n_{D} n_{T} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{DT}} V}{4 \\pi r^2}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the calculated value for $Y_n$ and the given distance $r = 10\\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n$$Y_n = 2.75 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$r = 10\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\phi_n$:\n$$\\phi_n = \\frac{2.75 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{4 \\pi (10\\ \\mathrm{m})^2}$$\n$$\\phi_n = \\frac{2.75 \\times 10^{19}}{4 \\pi (100)}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}$$\n$$\\phi_n = \\frac{2.75 \\times 10^{19}}{400 \\pi}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}$$\n$$\\phi_n = \\frac{2.75}{4\\pi} \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\phi_n \\approx 0.218840... \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}$$\n$$\\phi_n \\approx 2.18840... \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, as required by the problem:\n$$\\phi_n \\approx 2.19 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}$$\nThe two final numerical answers are the total emission rate, $Y_n = 2.75 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and the neutron flux at the detector, $\\phi_n = 2.19 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}$.",

Using a statistical interpretation of collisions as a spatial Poisson process, derive the expression for the fraction of incident neutrons that undergo at least one scatter within the slab. Then evaluate both quantities for the given parameters.\n\nExpress both the transmission (uncollided fraction) and the fraction undergoing at least one scatter as dimensionless numbers, and round your numerical results to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of neutron transport theory, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and expressed in objective, formal language. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. We may therefore proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two derivations and subsequent numerical evaluations related to the transport of a neutron beam through a material slab. The first part involves deriving the uncollided fraction from first principles of particle conservation, and the second involves deriving the fraction of neutrons that scatter at least once using a statistical interpretation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Uncollided Fraction (Transmission)**\n\nLet $I(\\vec{r}, E, \\vec{\\Omega})$ represent the angular neutron flux, defined as the number of neutrons with energy $E$ at position $\\vec{r}$ traveling in direction $\\vec{\\Omega}$ per unit area per unit time per unit energy per unit solid angle. For a monoenergetic, monodirectional beam incident normally on a plane-parallel slab, we can simplify the problem by considering only the spatial coordinate along the direction of incidence, say $x$, which is perpendicular to the slab face. The intensity of the uncollided beam at a depth $x$ can be denoted by $I(x)$.\n\nThe fundamental definition of the macroscopic total cross section, $\\Sigma_t$, is that it represents the probability of any type of interaction per unit path length for a neutron. Consider a thin differential slice of the material of thickness $dx$ at a depth $x$. The number of neutrons from the uncollided beam that interact within this slice is proportional to the number of incident neutrons on the slice, $I(x)$, and the thickness of the slice, $dx$. The constant of proportionality is $\\Sigma_t$.\n\nThe change in the beam intensity, $dI(x)$, due to neutrons being removed by interactions (scattering or absorption) in the slice $dx$ is given by:\n$$dI(x) = -I(x) \\Sigma_t dx$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the intensity of the uncollided beam decreases as it penetrates deeper into the material. This equation is a statement of the conservation of particles for the uncollided component of the flux. Rearranging this expression, we obtain a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\frac{dI(x)}{I(x)} = -\\Sigma_t dx$$\nWe solve this equation by integrating over the thickness of the slab. Let the incident intensity at the front face of the slab ($x=0$) be $I_0$. We integrate from the front face at $x=0$ to an arbitrary depth $x$:\n$$\\int_{I(0)}^{I(x)} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = \\int_{0}^{x} -\\Sigma_t dx'$$\nSince the medium is homogeneous, $\\Sigma_t$ is constant with respect to position. The integration yields:\n$$\\ln[I(x)] - \\ln[I(0)] = -\\Sigma_t x$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I(x)}{I(0)}\\right) = -\\Sigma_t x$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the well-known Beer-Lambert law for particle attenuation:\n$$I(x) = I(0) \\exp(-\\Sigma_t x)$$\nThe fraction of the incident neutrons that emerge from the slab of total thickness $L$ without any interaction is the transmission, $T$. This is the ratio of the emergent intensity at $x=L$ to the incident intensity at $x=0$:\n$$T = \\frac{I(L)}{I(0)} = \\frac{I(0) \\exp(-\\Sigma_t L)}{I(0)}$$\n$$T = \\exp(-\\Sigma_t L)$$\nThe quantity $\\Sigma_t L$ is a dimensionless value known as the optical thickness of the medium.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation from a Statistical (Poisson Process) Perspective**\n\nThe problem states that collisions along a straight path are independent events. This is a key characteristic of a Poisson process. We can model the number of collisions a neutron undergoes while traversing a certain path length as a random variable following a Poisson distribution.\n\nLet $\\lambda$ be the average rate of events (collisions) per unit path length. By definition, this rate is the macroscopic total cross section, $\\Sigma_t$. The mean number of collisions expected over a path length $L$ is $\\mu = \\lambda L = \\Sigma_t L$.\n\nThe probability of a neutron undergoing exactly $k$ collisions in traversing a path of length $L$ is given by the Poisson probability mass function:\n$$P(k; \\mu) = \\frac{\\mu^k e^{-\\mu}}{k!} = \\frac{(\\Sigma_t L)^k \\exp(-\\Sigma_t L)}{k!}$$\nThe fraction of incident neutrons that undergo at least one scatter within the slab corresponds to the probability of having one or more collisions, i.e., $P(k \\ge 1)$. It is simpler to calculate this as the complement of the probability of having zero collisions, $P(k=0)$.\nFirst, let us find the probability of zero collisions, which corresponds to the uncollided fraction derived previously:\n$$P(k=0) = \\frac{(\\Sigma_t L)^0 \\exp(-\\Sigma_t L)}{0!} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\Sigma_t L)}{1} = \\exp(-\\Sigma_t L)$$\nThis result for the uncollided fraction is identical to the one derived from the particle conservation equation, demonstrating the consistency between the deterministic and stochastic models.\n\nThe fraction of neutrons that undergo at least one scatter, which we denote as $P_{\\text{scatter}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\text{scatter}} = P(k \\ge 1) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} P(k; \\mu) = 1 - P(k=0)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(k=0)$:\n$$P_{\\text{scatter}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\Sigma_t L)$$\nThis is the desired expression for the fraction of neutrons undergoing at least one interaction.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- Slab thickness: $L = 20\\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n- Macroscopic total cross section: $\\Sigma_{t} = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless optical thickness, $\\tau = \\Sigma_t L$:\n$$\\tau = (0.25\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}) \\times (20\\ \\mathrm{cm}) = 5$$\nNow we can evaluate the two requested quantities.\n\nThe transmission (uncollided fraction), $T$, is:\n$$T = \\exp(-\\tau) = \\exp(-5)$$\n$$T \\approx 0.00673794699...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$T \\approx 0.006738$$\n\nThe fraction undergoing at least one scatter, $P_{\\text{scatter}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\text{scatter}} = 1 - T = 1 - \\exp(-5)$$\n$$P_{\\text{scatter}} \\approx 1 - 0.00673794699... = 0.993262053...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$P_{\\text{scatter}} \\approx 0.9933$$\n\nThe requested quantities are the transmission (uncollided fraction) and the fraction undergoing at least one scatter, evaluated for the given parameters. The final results are approximately $0.006738$ and $0.9933$, respectively.",

A solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Definition of Neutron Albedo**\nNeutron albedo, denoted by $\\alpha$, is a dimensionless quantity that describes the probability that a neutron entering a material through a surface will re-emerge from that same surface after one or more scattering interactions. It is a key parameter in reflector design and radiation shielding. The albedo is generally a function of the incident neutron's energy and angle, as well as the material's composition and geometry. The reflected neutron's energy and angular distribution are also important characteristics. The problem provides a simplified parameter, $a_1$, the \"first-collision single-scatter reflection probability,\" which represents the component of the albedo due to neutrons that scatter exactly once before re-emerging. This is the dominant contribution for thin reflectors or for high-energy neutrons where absorption cross sections are often smaller than scattering cross sections.\n\n**Estimation of Detector Count Rate**\n\nThe calculation proceeds in several steps:\n\n1.  **Neutron Flux at the Inner Wall:**\n    A point source emitting $S$ neutrons per second isotropically produces a neutron flux (particles per unit area per unit time) $\\Phi(r)$ at a distance $r$ given by:\n    $$ \\Phi(r) = \\frac{S}{4\\pi r^2} $$\n    At the inner wall of the spherical vessel, the radius is $R$. Therefore, the flux of incident neutrons on the wall is:\n    $$ \\Phi_{wall} = \\frac{S}{4\\pi R^2} $$\n\n2.  **Rate of Neutrons Incident on the Wall Patch:**\n    The detector views a wall patch of area $A_w$. Since the source is at the center of the sphere, the neutrons are incident normally upon the inner surface. The rate of neutrons hitting this specific patch, $N_{inc}$, is the flux multiplied by the patch area:\n    $$ N_{inc} = \\Phi_{wall} \\cdot A_w = \\frac{S A_w}{4\\pi R^2} $$\n\n3.  **Rate of Neutrons Scattered from the Patch:**\n    The problem provides the first-collision single-scatter reflection probability, $a_1$. This is the fraction of incident neutrons that scatter once and are reflected back into the vacuum vessel. The number of such neutrons re-emitted from the patch per second, $N_{scat}$, is:\n    $$ N_{scat} = N_{inc} \\cdot a_1 = \\frac{S A_w a_1}{4\\pi R^2} $$\n    This patch now acts as a secondary source of scattered neutrons.\n\n4.  **Rate of Scattered Neutrons Entering the Detector:**\n    The problem states that these scattered neutrons are emitted isotropically over the outward hemisphere, which spans a solid angle of $2\\pi$ steradians. The angular intensity of the scattered neutrons (neutrons per steradian per second) from the patch is:\n    $$ I_{scat} = \\frac{N_{scat}}{2\\pi} $$\n    The detector has a narrow collimator and subtends a small solid angle $\\Omega_d$ as seen from the patch. The rate at which scattered neutrons enter the detector's aperture, $N_{det\\_inc}$, is the angular intensity multiplied by this solid angle:\n    $$ N_{det\\_inc} = I_{scat} \\cdot \\Omega_d = \\frac{N_{scat} \\Omega_d}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{S A_w a_1}{4\\pi R^2} \\right) \\Omega_d $$\n    Combining terms, we get:\n    $$ N_{det\\_inc} = \\frac{S A_w a_1 \\Omega_d}{8\\pi^2 R^2} $$\n\n5.  **Detector Count Rate:**\n    The detector count rate, $C$, is the number of neutrons entering the detector per second, $N_{det\\_inc}$, multiplied by the detector's intrinsic efficiency, $\\epsilon$. The efficiency represents the probability that a neutron entering the detector will produce a recordable event.\n    $$ C = N_{det\\_inc} \\cdot \\epsilon $$\n    Substituting the expression for $N_{det\\_inc}$:\n    $$ C = \\frac{S A_w a_1 \\Omega_d \\epsilon}{8\\pi^2 R^2} $$\n\n**Additional Assumptions:**\nIn applying the given intrinsic efficiency $\\epsilon$, we make the following assumption, which is standard for such estimation problems:\n-   The energy of neutrons after a single scattering event is assumed to be sufficiently close to the initial energy ($14.1\\ \\mathrm{MeV}$) that the detector efficiency $\\epsilon$, specified at $14.1\\ \\mathrm{MeV}$, can be used for the scattered neutrons without modification. This is a reasonable approximation since the energy loss in a single elastic scatter from a heavy nucleus (like Iron, Nickel, or Chromium in stainless steel) is small.\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression for the count rate $C$:\n-   $S = 1.0 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $A_w = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$\n-   $a_1 = 4.0 \\times 10^{-2}$\n-   $\\Omega_d = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{sr}$\n-   $\\epsilon = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}$\n-   $R = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\n$$ C = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{18}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}) (4.0 \\times 10^{-2}) (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) (3.0 \\times 10^{-2})}{8\\pi^2 (2.0)^2} $$\nThe numerator is:\n$$ (1.0 \\times 1.0 \\times 4.0 \\times 5.0 \\times 3.0) \\times 10^{18 - 2 - 2 - 5 - 2} = 60.0 \\times 10^{7} = 6.0 \\times 10^{8} $$\nThe denominator is:\n$$ 8\\pi^2 (2.0)^2 = 8\\pi^2 (4.0) = 32\\pi^2 $$\nSo, the count rate is:\n$$ C = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{8}}{32\\pi^2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nUsing $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265$, we find $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696044$.\n$$ C \\approx \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{8}}{32 \\times 9.8696044} \\approx \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{8}}{315.82734} \\approx 1.8998 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe problem asks to round the answer to $3$ significant figures.\n$$ C \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe units are counts per second ($\\mathrm{cps}$).",
