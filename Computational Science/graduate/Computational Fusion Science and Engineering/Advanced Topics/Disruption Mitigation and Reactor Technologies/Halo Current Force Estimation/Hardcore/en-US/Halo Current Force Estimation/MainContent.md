## Introduction
In the pursuit of fusion energy, the safe and reliable operation of tokamaks is paramount. However, a significant challenge to [structural integrity](@entry_id:165319) arises from plasma disruptions—sudden, uncontrolled terminations of the plasma discharge. During these events, immense electromagnetic forces are generated that can damage the machine's internal components. A primary source of these forces is the halo current, a unique current that flows from the plasma, through the vessel wall, and back into the plasma. Accurately estimating the forces produced by these currents is a critical and complex task for fusion engineers, representing a key knowledge gap between plasma physics and [structural mechanics](@entry_id:276699). This article provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and quantifying halo current forces. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, will demystify the physics of [halo currents](@entry_id:750136), distinguishing them from eddy currents and detailing the sequence of events during a disruption that leads to their formation. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will bridge theory and practice by exploring how these concepts are used in detailed engineering design, system-level analysis, and the development of mitigation strategies. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** chapter will offer opportunities to apply this knowledge through targeted computational and analytical problems. Through this structured approach, readers will gain the expertise needed to analyze one of the most critical engineering challenges in modern [tokamak design](@entry_id:1133215).

## Principles and Mechanisms

### Currents in a Disrupting Plasma System

During a [plasma disruption](@entry_id:753494), the rapid release of stored magnetic and thermal energy drives complex electromagnetic phenomena within the tokamak vessel. To understand the resulting forces, it is essential to distinguish between three classes of currents that arise during this transient event.

First is the **plasma current**, $I_p$, which under normal operating conditions is a toroidally directed current confined entirely within the closed [magnetic flux surfaces](@entry_id:751623) of the plasma. Its stability and confinement are the very objects of fusion research. During a disruption, this current decays rapidly, an event known as the **[current quench](@entry_id:748116)**.

Second are **eddy currents**. As the plasma current quenches and the plasma column moves, the magnetic flux threading the surrounding conducting structures, such as the vacuum vessel and passive stabilizing plates, changes with time. In accordance with Faraday's law of induction, $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$, this time-varying magnetic field induces an [electromotive force](@entry_id:203175) that drives currents within these conductors. These induced currents are known as [eddy currents](@entry_id:275449). A defining characteristic of eddy currents is that they flow in closed loops entirely *within* the conducting material, with no net current crossing the interface between the conductor and the surrounding vacuum or plasma . They are a direct consequence of [electromagnetic induction](@entry_id:181154).

Third, and of primary concern for structural integrity, are **[halo currents](@entry_id:750136)**. These are a distinct class of currents that are initiated when the hot, conducting outer region of the plasma—the halo or [scrape-off layer](@entry_id:182765)—comes into direct electrical contact with the vessel wall. Unlike eddy currents, the circuit for a halo current is not confined to the wall. Instead, it forms a **plasma–wall–plasma circuit**: current flows from the plasma core, through the halo region, into the vessel wall at one location, through the conducting wall structure (typically in the poloidal direction), and re-enters the plasma halo at another location to complete the loop. This requires a conducting path through the plasma-wall interface, a feature absent for eddy currents . The total magnitude of the halo current, $I_{\mathrm{halo}}$, is often characterized by the **halo current fraction**, $f_{\mathrm{halo}} = I_{\mathrm{halo}}/I_p$, where $I_p$ is the pre-disruption plasma current. Multi-machine studies indicate that for engineering design purposes, this fraction can reach significant values, typically in the range of $f_{\mathrm{halo}} \sim 0.1$–$0.3$ .

### The Causal Sequence of Disruption

Halo currents do not arise spontaneously; they are the culmination of a rapid sequence of events that constitutes a major disruption. The process begins with a **thermal quench (TQ)**, a catastrophic loss of thermal energy that causes the plasma temperature to collapse. This is followed by the **current quench (CQ)**, the decay of the [plasma current](@entry_id:182365), and is often accompanied by a loss of positional control, leading to a **[vertical displacement event](@entry_id:1133790) (VDE)** in elongated plasmas.

The key to understanding the formation of [halo currents](@entry_id:750136) lies in the hierarchy of the characteristic timescales governing these phases.
- The **[thermal quench](@entry_id:755893) time**, $\tau_{TQ}$, is the e-folding time of the plasma thermal energy decay. It is exceedingly rapid, typically on the order of $0.1$–$2\,\mathrm{ms}$ for medium-sized tokamaks.
- The **[current quench](@entry_id:748116) time**, $\tau_{CQ}$, is the characteristic e-folding time of the [plasma current](@entry_id:182365) decay. This decay is governed by the inductive-resistive properties of the entire coupled plasma-wall system after the plasma has become highly resistive due to the TQ. Typical values for $\tau_{CQ}$ are in the range of $5$–$50\,\mathrm{ms}$.
- The **[wall time](@entry_id:756614)**, $\tau_w$, is the characteristic $L/R$ time for [eddy currents](@entry_id:275449) induced in the vacuum vessel to decay. For typical stainless-steel vessels, $\tau_w$ is on the order of $50$–$200\,\mathrm{ms}$.

The critical relationship is $\tau_{TQ} \ll \tau_{CQ} \lesssim \tau_w$ . This ordering reveals that the thermal collapse happens first, dramatically increasing [plasma resistivity](@entry_id:196902). The subsequent [current quench](@entry_id:748116) occurs on a timescale that is comparable to, or even shorter than, the resistive decay time of the vessel. This means the vessel behaves as an excellent conductor during the CQ, responding inductively to the plasma's decay. This strong **[inductive coupling](@entry_id:262141)** between the plasma and the wall is the foundational condition for the generation of large eddy and [halo currents](@entry_id:750136). The fast change in poloidal flux during the CQ induces a large toroidal loop voltage, which acts as the primary [electromotive force](@entry_id:203175) for driving these currents .

During a VDE, the plasma column's motion towards the wall alters the [mutual inductance](@entry_id:264504), $M(z)$, between the plasma and the vessel. Even before physical contact, this motion induces eddy currents. In the early phase of a VDE, when the timescale of motion $\Delta t$ is much shorter than $\tau_w$, the vessel current $I_w$ is governed by flux conservation, leading to $I_w \approx -\Delta(M I_p)/L_w$, where $L_w$ is the vessel inductance .

### Formation and Closure of the Halo Current Path

The toroidal [loop voltage](@entry_id:1127453) induced during the CQ seeks a path of least resistance. The establishment of this path is a geometric and magnetohydrodynamic process involving the plasma boundary.

As the VDE progresses, the plasma's magnetic boundary, the **[separatrix](@entry_id:175112)**, moves towards the wall. The points where the [separatrix](@entry_id:175112) intersects divertor plates are known as **strike points**. During a VDE, these strike points migrate off the divertor and onto the main chamber wall. The moment the separatrix first touches the wall marks the creation of a new, short electrical connection between the plasma and the wall .

The physical mechanism enabling current flow across this connection is the highly **anisotropic [electrical conductivity](@entry_id:147828)** of the magnetized plasma in the scrape-off layer (SOL), where conductivity parallel to the magnetic field, $\sigma_{\parallel}$, is many orders of magnitude greater than the perpendicular conductivity, $\sigma_{\perp}$. The open magnetic field lines in the SOL, now terminating on the wall, act as low-resistance "wires." The toroidal electric field, $E_{\phi}$, induced by the CQ has a significant component parallel to these field lines, $E_{\parallel} \approx E_{\phi}$. This parallel electric field drives a large current density, $\mathbf{J}_{\parallel} = \sigma_{\parallel} \mathbf{E}_{\parallel}$, along the field lines to the wall . At the point of contact, this current must enter the wall to satisfy charge conservation ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0$), flow through the vessel structure, and re-enter the plasma SOL at a different location to complete the circuit. This is the halo current.

### The Lorentz Force: From Local Density to Global Load

Once currents are flowing in the vessel wall, they interact with the strong background magnetic field to produce Lorentz forces. The force density is given by $\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}$. Understanding the net structural load requires examining the contributions from both [eddy currents](@entry_id:275449) and [halo currents](@entry_id:750136).

The force components depend directly on the local orientation of the current density and the magnetic field. In a tokamak, the magnetic field is predominantly toroidal ($\mathbf{B} \approx B_{\phi} \hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$), with a smaller poloidal component ($B_{\theta} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$). The currents in the wall can have both toroidal ($J_{\phi}$) and poloidal ($J_{\theta}$) components. The resulting radial force density, for example, arises from two main contributions: the interaction of poloidal current with the toroidal field ($J_{\theta} B_{\phi}$) and the interaction of toroidal current with the [poloidal field](@entry_id:188655) ($J_{\phi} B_{\theta}$). A careful application of the [vector cross product](@entry_id:156484) shows these two terms can have opposite signs, with the net radial force density being $f_r = J_{\theta} B_{\phi} - J_{\phi} B_{\theta}$ (in a standard right-handed coordinate system) .

A crucial distinction arises when we integrate these force densities to find the net force on the vessel. **Eddy currents**, flowing in closed, axisymmetric loops within the wall, produce local forces that cancel out when integrated over the entire structure. For example, a poloidal eddy [current loop](@entry_id:271292) will have an outward radial component ($J_R > 0$) on the top and an inward radial component ($J_R  0$) on the bottom. The resulting vertical forces ($f_Z \propto -J_R B_{\phi}$) will be equal and opposite, leading to zero net vertical force .

In contrast, **[halo currents](@entry_id:750136)** flow as an open arc through the vessel wall. Because the current enters at one poloidal location and exits at another, the path is not closed within the wall, and the forces do not necessarily cancel. For instance, a halo current entering the bottom of the vessel and flowing poloidally creates a net radial current component ($J_R$) through the wall's cross-section. This radial current, crossing the strong toroidal field $B_{\phi}$, produces a large, non-zero net vertical force, $F_Z = \int (-J_R B_{\phi}) dV$ . The magnitude of these forces can be immense; for a total poloidal halo current $I_h$ flowing across a diameter $2a$ of the vessel in a field $B_t$, the resulting vertical force can be estimated as $F_z \approx 2 I_h B_t a$. For a large tokamak, this can be on the order of several mega-Newtons (MN)  .

### Non-Uniformity and Peaking Factors

In reality, [halo currents](@entry_id:750136) are highly non-uniform. The instabilities driving the disruption are not perfectly axisymmetric, causing the halo current to be localized toroidally. This non-uniformity is a critical factor in [structural analysis](@entry_id:153861) and is quantified using dimensionless **peaking factors**.

The **toroidal peaking factor**, $PF_{\phi}$, characterizes the toroidal localization. It is defined as the ratio of the peak poloidally-integrated current at a given toroidal angle to the toroidally-averaged value. Since [halo currents](@entry_id:750136) can be concentrated in narrow "jets," $PF_{\phi}$ can be significantly greater than one, with values of 2–3 being common. The peak structural load on any given toroidal sector of the vessel is directly proportional to $PF_{\phi}$.

The **poloidal peaking factor**, $PF_{\theta}$, characterizes the localization of the current within the poloidal cross-section of the contact area. Together, these factors determine the peak local force density, which scales as $f_{\mathrm{max}} \propto PF_{\theta} \cdot PF_{\phi} \cdot \bar{J} \cdot B_0$, where $\bar{J}$ is the average current density. Ignoring these peaking factors would lead to a severe underestimation of the peak stresses on vessel components .

### Governing Equations for Quasi-Static Analysis

For [quantitative analysis](@entry_id:149547) and computational modeling of halo current phenomena, a self-consistent mathematical framework is required. Given that the characteristic timescales of the [current quench](@entry_id:748116) are much longer than the propagation time of [electromagnetic waves](@entry_id:269085), the problem can be accurately described within the **quasi-static** approximation of electromagnetism.

In this regime, the displacement current in Ampère's law is negligible within conductors. The governing system of equations for the magnetic field vector $\mathbf{H}$, magnetic flux density $\mathbf{B}$, electric field $\mathbf{E}$, and current density $\mathbf{J}$ is as follows :
- **Ampère's Law** (quasi-static): $\nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{J}$
- **Faraday's Law**: $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$
- **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$
- **Charge Conservation**: $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0$, which is a direct consequence of the quasi-static Ampère's law.
- **Constitutive Relations**: $\mathbf{B} = \mu \mathbf{H}$ and Ohm's Law, $\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E}$ (or $\mathbf{E} = \rho \mathbf{J}$), where $\mu$ is the [magnetic permeability](@entry_id:204028), $\sigma$ is the [electrical conductivity](@entry_id:147828), and $\rho$ is the resistivity.

This system must be supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions. At the interface between different materials (e.g., the vessel conductor and the surrounding vacuum), the normal component of $\mathbf{B}$ and the tangential components of $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ must be continuous (assuming no surface currents). On electrically insulating boundaries of a conductor, no current can pass, which imposes the condition $\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0$, where $\mathbf{n}$ is the surface normal vector. This set of equations forms the basis for finite element and other numerical methods used to simulate [halo currents](@entry_id:750136) and estimate the resulting [electromagnetic forces](@entry_id:196024) on tokamak components .
