The problem is well-posed, providing a clear objective, all necessary data, including a statistical distribution for $E_d$, and the mathematical definition of the quantity to be calculated. The crucial assumption that the asymptotic regime of the models applies is explicitly checked:\n-   For the KP model, the asymptotic regime requires $T_d \\geq 2E_d$. The maximum $E_d$ is $E_2 = 40 \\text{ eV}$. The condition is $1000 \\text{ eV} \\geq 2 \\times 40 \\text{ eV} = 80 \\text{ eV}$, which is satisfied.\n-   For the NRT model, the asymptotic regime requires $T_d \\geq \\frac{2E_d}{0.8}$. The condition is $1000 \\text{ eV} \\geq \\frac{2 \\times 40 \\text{ eV}}{0.8} = 100 \\text{ eV}$, which is also satisfied.\nThe problem is self-contained, objective, and logically consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe number of atomic displacements, $N_d$, produced by a Primary Knock-on Atom (PKA) with damage energy $T_d$ is estimated by analytical models. We are asked to derive the expressions for the Kinchin-Pease (KP) and Norgett-Robinson-Torrens (NRT) models and then compute their expected values.\n\n**Kinchin-Pease (KP) Model**\n\nThe KP model is based on a simplified picture of the collision cascade using hard-sphere collisions. The problem directs a derivation from conservation of energy. To create a displacement, a recoil atom must be given at least the threshold displacement energy, $E_d$. However, the atom striking it also loses energy. In this simplified model, the cascade of collisions continues until no atom in the cascade has sufficient energy to create a new displacement. The model posits that the average energy expended from the initial PKA energy to create one stable Frenkel pair is $2E_d$. This accounts for the energy given to the displaced atom and the energy lost by the striking atom, which must fall below the displacement threshold to cease creating further defects. Thus, from an energy conservation standpoint, the total number of displacements is the total available damage energy divided by the average energy cost per displacement.\n\nIn the asymptotic regime, where $T_d$ is much larger than $E_d$, the number of displacements, $N_d^{\\text{KP}}$, is given by:\n$$N_d^{\\text{KP}}(T_d, E_d) = \\frac{T_d}{2E_d}$$\n\n**Norgett-Robinson-Torrens (NRT) Model**\n\nThe NRT model is a refinement of the KP model, incorporating results from computer simulations of collision cascades. It introduces a displacement efficiency factor, typically $0.8$, to account for the fact that a significant fraction of initially displaced atoms will quickly recombine with nearby vacancies, and thus do not result in stable Frenkel pairs. The model also handles the partitioning of energy between nuclear and electronic stopping, but the problem simplifies this by providing the \"available damage energy\" $T_d$ directly.\n\nIn its asymptotic regime, the NRT model gives the number of displacements, $N_d^{\\text{NRT}}$, as:\n$$N_d^{\\text{NRT}}(T_d, E_d) = \\frac{0.8 T_d}{2E_d}$$\nThis is simply $0.8$ times the value predicted by the KP model.\n\n**Calculation of Expected DPA**\n\nThe threshold displacement energy, $E_d$, is given as a random variable with a uniform probability density function $p(E_d)$ on the interval $[E_1, E_2]$. The expected number of displacements, $\\mathbb{E}[N_d]$, is found by integrating the product of the displacement formula $N_d(T_d, E_d)$ and the PDF $p(E_d)$ over all possible values of $E_d$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_d] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} N_d(T_d,E_d)\\,p(E_d)\\,dE_d$$\nSince $p(E_d)$ is non-zero only on the interval $[E_1, E_2]$, the integral becomes:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_d] = \\int_{E_1}^{E_2} N_d(T_d,E_d) \\left(\\frac{1}{E_2 - E_1}\\right) dE_d$$\n\n**Expected DPA for the KP Model**\n\nSubstituting the KP formula for $N_d$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{KP}}] = \\int_{E_1}^{E_2} \\left(\\frac{T_d}{2E_d}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{E_2 - E_1}\\right) dE_d$$\nThe terms that do not depend on $E_d$ can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{KP}}] = \\frac{T_d}{2(E_2 - E_1)} \\int_{E_1}^{E_2} \\frac{1}{E_d} dE_d$$\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{E_d}$ with respect to $E_d$ is $\\ln(E_d)$. Evaluating the definite integral:\n$$\\int_{E_1}^{E_2} \\frac{1}{E_d} dE_d = [\\ln(E_d)]_{E_1}^{E_2} = \\ln(E_2) - \\ln(E_1) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{E_2}{E_1}\\right)$$\nSo, the analytical expression for the expected KP displacements is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{KP}}] = \\frac{T_d}{2(E_2 - E_1)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{E_2}{E_1}\\right)$$\n\n**Expected DPA for the NRT Model**\n\nThe same procedure is followed for the NRT model:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{NRT}}] = \\int_{E_1}^{E_2} \\left(\\frac{0.8 T_d}{2E_d}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{E_2 - E_1}\\right) dE_d$$\nFactoring out the constants:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{NRT}}] = \\frac{0.8 T_d}{2(E_2 - E_1)} \\int_{E_1}^{E_2} \\frac{1}{E_d} dE_d = 0.8 \\left( \\frac{T_d}{2(E_2 - E_1)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{E_2}{E_1}\\right) \\right)$$\nThus, the expected NRT displacements are simply $0.8$ times the expected KP displacements:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{NRT}}] = 0.8 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{KP}}]$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nNow, we substitute the given values: $T_d=1.0 \\times 10^3 \\text{ eV}$, $E_1=20 \\text{ eV}$, and $E_2=40 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nFor the KP model:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{KP}}] = \\frac{1000}{2(40 - 20)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{40}{20}\\right)$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{KP}}] = \\frac{1000}{2(20)} \\ln(2) = \\frac{1000}{40} \\ln(2) = 25 \\ln(2)$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{KP}}] \\approx 25 \\times 0.693147 = 17.328675...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{KP}}] \\approx 17.33$.\n\nFor the NRT model:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{NRT}}] = 0.8 \\times \\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{KP}}] = 0.8 \\times 25 \\ln(2) = 20 \\ln(2)$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{NRT}}] \\approx 20 \\times 0.693147 = 13.86294...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\mathbb{E}[N_d^{\\text{NRT}}] \\approx 13.86$.\n\nThe two expected values are approximately $17.33$ for the KP model and $13.86$ for the NRT model.",

The NRT model is a standard baseline, and the ARC correction represents a common and physically motivated refinement. The kinematic equations are standard.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is fully specified. All necessary parameters ($A, E_d, \\sigma_0$), physical models ($N_d^{\\text{NRT}}$, $\\eta(T)$), neutron spectra, and unit conventions are provided. The objective—to compute a specific ratio—is unambiguous. The edge case where the denominator might be zero is explicitly handled.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\nThe problem exhibits no flaws from the invalidity checklist. It is a formalizable, self-contained, and scientifically sound problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A step-by-step solution will be developed.\n\n### Principle-Based Design and Derivations\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the analytical expressions for the displacement cross-section $\\sigma_d(E)$ and then integrating these over the provided multigroup neutron spectrum to find the total DPA rate $R$.\n\n**1. Energy Transfer and Differential Cross-Section**\n\nFor a neutron of energy $E$ undergoing an elastic collision with a target nucleus of mass ratio $A$, the maximum possible energy transferred to the nucleus (the PKA) is:\n$$ T_{\\max}(E) = \\frac{4A}{(A+1)^2} E $$\nA critical aspect is unit consistency. Since $E$ is given in MeV and $T$ is used with $E_d$ in eV, we must convert $E$ to eV: $E [\\text{eV}] = E [\\text{MeV}] \\times 10^6$.\nThe assumption of isotropic scattering in the CM frame leads to a uniform probability distribution for the recoil energy $T \\in [0, T_{\\max}(E)]$. The differential elastic scattering cross-section with respect to recoil energy $T$ is therefore constant over this interval:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma}{dT}(E, T) = \\frac{\\sigma_s(E)}{T_{\\max}(E)} \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le T \\le T_{\\max}(E) $$\nand zero otherwise. The total elastic scattering cross-section $\\sigma_s(E)$ is given as a constant $\\sigma_0$ for each material.\n\n**2. Displacement Cross-Section $\\sigma_d(E)$**\n\nThe displacement cross-section is the expectation value of the number of displacements produced by an incident neutron of energy $E$. It is obtained by integrating the number of displacements per PKA, $N_d(T)$, over all possible recoil energies, weighted by the differential cross-section:\n$$ \\sigma_d(E) = \\int_0^{T_{\\max}(E)} N_d(T) \\frac{d\\sigma}{dT}(E, T) dT = \\frac{\\sigma_s(E)}{T_{\\max}(E)} \\int_0^{T_{\\max}(E)} N_d(T) dT $$\nSince displacements are only created when $T \\ge E_d$, the lower integration limit is effectively $E_d$. If $T_{\\max}(E) \\le E_d$, no displacements occur, and $\\sigma_d(E) = 0$.\n$$ \\sigma_d(E) = \\frac{\\sigma_s(E)}{T_{\\max}(E)} \\int_{E_d}^{T_{\\max}(E)} N_d(T) dT $$\n\n**3. Calculation of $\\sigma_d(E)$ for NRT Model**\n\nFor the NRT model, $N_d^{\\text{NRT}}(T) = K T / E_d$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{E_d}^{T_{\\max}(E)} \\frac{K T}{E_d} dT = \\frac{K}{E_d} \\left[ \\frac{T^2}{2} \\right]_{E_d}^{T_{\\max}(E)} = \\frac{K}{2E_d} \\left( T_{\\max}^2(E) - E_d^2 \\right) $$\nThus, for $T_{\\max}(E) > E_d$:\n$$ \\sigma_d^{\\text{NRT}}(E) = \\frac{\\sigma_s(E)}{T_{\\max}(E)} \\frac{K}{2E_d} \\left( T_{\\max}^2(E) - E_d^2 \\right) $$\n\n**4. Calculation of $\\sigma_d(E)$ for ARC Model**\n\nFor the ARC model, $N_d^{\\text{arc}}(T) = \\eta(T) N_d^{\\text{NRT}}(T)$. The integral is:\n$$ \\int_{E_d}^{T_{\\max}(E)} \\eta(T) \\frac{K T}{E_d} dT = \\frac{K}{E_d} \\int_{E_d}^{T_{\\max}(E)} \\eta(T) T dT $$\nThe efficiency $\\eta(T)$ is piecewise. We define a crossover energy $T_c$ where the power-law component equals the minimum efficiency floor: $\\eta_{\\min} = (T_c/T_0)^{-p}$, which gives $T_c = T_0 (\\eta_{\\min})^{-1/p}$. With $p=0.3$ and $\\eta_{\\min}=0.2$, $T_c = 1000 \\times (0.2)^{-1/0.3} \\approx 203091.5$ eV. The integrand $\\eta(T)T$ has three forms over the relevant energy range, since $E_d < T_0 < T_c$ for the given cases. Let $U = T_{\\max}(E)$. The integral $J(U) = \\int_{E_d}^{U} \\eta(T) T dT$ is calculated piecewise:\n\n- If $U \\le E_d$: $J(U) = 0$.\n- If $E_d < U \\le T_0$: $\\eta(T)=1$.\n  $$ J(U) = \\int_{E_d}^{U} T dT = \\frac{1}{2}(U^2 - E_d^2) $$\n- If $T_0 < U \\le T_c$: $\\eta(T)=(T/T_0)^{-p}$.\n  $$ J(U) = \\int_{E_d}^{T_0} T dT + \\int_{T_0}^{U} T_0^p T^{1-p} dT = \\frac{1}{2}(T_0^2 - E_d^2) + \\frac{T_0^p}{2-p}(U^{2-p} - T_0^{2-p}) $$\n- If $U > T_c$: $\\eta(T)=\\eta_{\\min}$.\n  $$\n\\begin{aligned}\nJ(U) = \\int_{E_d}^{T_0} T dT + \\int_{T_0}^{T_c} T_0^p T^{1-p} dT + \\int_{T_c}^{U} \\eta_{\\min} T dT \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2}(T_0^2 - E_d^2) + \\frac{T_0^p}{2-p}(T_c^{2-p} - T_0^{2-p}) + \\frac{\\eta_{\\min}}{2}(U^2 - T_c^2)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe ARC displacement cross-section for $T_{\\max}(E)  E_d$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_d^{\\text{arc}}(E) = \\frac{\\sigma_s(E)}{T_{\\max}(E)} \\frac{K}{E_d} J(T_{\\max}(E)) $$\n\n**5. DPA Rate Calculation**\n\nThe total DPA rate, $R$, is the sum of the rates from each group in the multigroup neutron spectrum. For each group $i$ with representative energy $E_i$, width $\\Delta E_i$, and flux $\\phi_i$, the total group flux is $\\Phi_i = \\phi_i \\Delta E_i$. The DPA rate is:\n$$ R = \\sum_i \\sigma_d(E_i) \\Phi_i = \\sum_i \\sigma_d(E_i) \\phi_i \\Delta E_i $$\nThis summation is performed for both $\\sigma_d^{\\text{NRT}}$ and $\\sigma_d^{\\text{arc}}$ to obtain $R_{\\text{NRT}}$ and $R_{\\text{arc}}$, respectively. All units must be consistent. We use SI units for the calculation: $\\sigma_s$ in $\\text{m}^2$, energies in eV (where used with eV-based parameters like $E_d$), and flux in $\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\\,\\text{MeV}^{-1}$. The product $\\sigma_d(E_i)$ (in $\\text{m}^2$) and $\\phi_i \\Delta E_i$ (in $\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$) correctly yields a rate in $\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, the comparison metric for each case is calculated as $R_{\\text{arc}} / R_{\\text{NRT}}$, with the value being $0.0$ if $R_{\\text{NRT}}$ is zero.",
