Many materials, especially those near the plasma, become radioactive during operation. This exercise  focuses on the fundamental process governing the hazard reduction of this material over time: radioactive decay. By deriving and applying the exponential decay law, you will tackle a practical problem in waste management—calculating the necessary \"cooling time\" for a component's activity to decrease to a level deemed safe for clearance by regulators.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimum cooling time, $t_{\\mathrm{clear}}$, for a radioactive component to meet a specific activity clearance criterion. The decay process is described as a first-order, Markovian process.\n\nThe fundamental postulate for such a process is that the rate of decay of radioactive nuclei is directly proportional to the number of nuclei, $N(t)$, present at time $t$. This is expressed by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\lambda N(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the decay constant, representing the probability per unit time that a single nucleus will decay.\n\nThe activity, $A(t)$, is defined as the expected number of decays per unit time, which is the negative of the rate of change of the number of nuclei:\n$$\nA(t) = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\nSubstituting the first equation into the definition of activity yields a direct relationship between activity and the number of nuclei:\n$$\nA(t) = \\lambda N(t)\n$$\nTo find the time evolution of the activity, we differentiate this expression with respect to time:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\lambda \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\lambda N(t)$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\lambda (-\\lambda N(t)) = -\\lambda (\\lambda N(t))\n$$\nSince $A(t) = \\lambda N(t)$, we arrive at the differential equation for activity:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\lambda A(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A}{A} = -\\lambda \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a later time $t$, and from the initial activity $A(0) = A_0$ to $A(t)$, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{A_0}^{A(t)} \\frac{1}{A'} \\mathrm{d}A' = \\int_0^t -\\lambda \\mathrm{d}t'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(A(t)) - \\ln(A_0) = -\\lambda t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{A(t)}{A_0}\\right) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the law of radioactive decay for activity:\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nThe decay constant $\\lambda$ is related to the half-life, $T_{1/2}$. By definition, at $t=T_{1/2}$, the activity is reduced to half its initial value, $A(T_{1/2}) = A_0/2$. Substituting this into the decay law:\n$$\n\\frac{A_0}{2} = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda T_{1/2})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-\\lambda T_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\lambda T_{1/2} \\implies -\\ln(2) = -\\lambda T_{1/2}\n$$\nThus, the decay constant is given by:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a clearance criterion based on the mass-specific activity, which is the total activity $A(t)$ divided by the component mass $m$. The specific activity at time $t$ is $S(t) = A(t)/m$. The clearance condition is:\n$$\nS(t_{\\mathrm{clear}}) < L_{\\mathrm{cl}}\n$$\nwhere $L_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ is the regulatory clearance limit. To find the minimum cooling time, we solve for the time $t_{\\mathrm{clear}}$ at which the specific activity is equal to the clearance limit:\n$$\n\\frac{A(t_{\\mathrm{clear}})}{m} = L_{\\mathrm{cl}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t_{\\mathrm{clear}})}{m} = L_{\\mathrm{cl}}\n$$\nWe now solve for $t_{\\mathrm{clear}}$:\n$$\n\\exp(-\\lambda t_{\\mathrm{clear}}) = \\frac{m L_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{A_0}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\lambda t_{\\mathrm{clear}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{m L_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{A_0}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{m L_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{A_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_0}{m L_{\\mathrm{cl}}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} = \\frac{T_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_0}{m L_{\\mathrm{cl}}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$A_0 = 2.5 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{Bq}$\n$m = 500 \\mathrm{kg}$\n$L_{\\mathrm{cl}} = 0.5 \\mathrm{Bq \\cdot kg^{-1}}$\n$T_{1/2} = 5.271 \\mathrm{y}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total activity limit for the component:\n$$\nm L_{\\mathrm{cl}} = (500) \\times (0.5) = 250 \\mathrm{Bq}\n$$\nNext, we determine the required reduction factor, which is the ratio of the initial activity to the target activity:\n$$\n\\frac{A_0}{m L_{\\mathrm{cl}}} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^9}{250} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^9}{2.5 \\times 10^2} = 10^7\n$$\nNow we can calculate $t_{\\mathrm{clear}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} = \\frac{5.271 \\mathrm{y}}{\\ln(2)} \\ln(10^7)\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(x^p) = p \\ln(x)$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} = \\frac{5.271 \\times 7 \\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)} \\mathrm{y}\n$$\nUsing the standard values $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$ and $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} \\approx \\frac{5.271 \\times 7 \\times 2.302585}{0.693147} \\mathrm{y}\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} \\approx \\frac{84.97825}{0.693147} \\mathrm{y}\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} \\approx 122.598 \\mathrm{y}\n$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} \\approx 122.6 \\mathrm{y}\n$$\nThis is the minimum time required for the mass-specific activity to fall to the level of $L_{\\mathrm{cl}}$.
