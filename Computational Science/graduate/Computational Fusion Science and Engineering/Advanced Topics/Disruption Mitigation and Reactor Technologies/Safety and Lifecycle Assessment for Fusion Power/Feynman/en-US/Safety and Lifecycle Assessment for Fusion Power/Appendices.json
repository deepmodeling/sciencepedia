            "problem": "You are to develop a complete, runnable program that computes the buildup (end-of-irradiation activity) of key activation products produced from an idealized vanadium alloy under two distinct neutron spectra (thermal and fast) using first-principles rate equations and their Bateman-type solutions. The focus is on radionuclides produced from stable vanadium isotope $^{51}\\mathrm{V}$, which dominates natural vanadium. Assume the alloy is idealized as pure vanadium with respect to activation by neutrons; neglect activation of minor alloying constituents and any subsequent activation of the daughter products beyond their first decay.\n\nFundamental base and definitions to use:\n- Radioactive decay law: if $N(t)$ is the number of radioactive nuclei, then $\\dfrac{dN}{dt} = -\\lambda N$, where $\\lambda = \\dfrac{\\ln 2}{t_{1/2}}$ is the decay constant, $t_{1/2}$ is the half-life, and the activity $A(t) = \\lambda N(t)$ has International System of Units (SI) unit Becquerel (Bq), where $1$ Bq $= 1$ s$^{-1}$.\n- Neutron-induced reaction production rate: for a target population $N_{\\text{target}}(t)$ subjected to a constant neutron flux $\\phi$ (in n cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$), the production rate of a reaction channel with microscopic cross section $\\sigma$ (in barns, with $1$ barn $= 10^{-24}$ cm$^{2}$) is $\\phi \\sigma N_{\\text{target}}(t)$.\n- Natural isotopic composition of vanadium: the number fraction of $^{51}\\mathrm{V}$ is $0.9975$ (expressed as a decimal, not a percentage). The atomic weight of natural vanadium is $50.9415$ g/mol. Use Avogadro's number $N_{\\mathrm{A}} = 6.02214076\\times 10^{23}$ mol$^{-1}$.\n- Consider only the following reactions starting from the stable parent $^{51}\\mathrm{V}$: $(\\mathrm{n},\\gamma)$ producing $^{52}\\mathrm{V}$, and $(\\mathrm{n},\\alpha)$ producing $^{48}\\mathrm{Sc}$. Neglect any reactions on the daughters and any competing removal channels for the daughters other than their radioactive decay. Model removal of the parent $^{51}\\mathrm{V}$ only by these two reactions.\n- Assume constant flux and energy-independent cross sections for each spectrum case, no self-shielding, and spatial homogeneity.\n\nDerivation requirements:\n- Starting from the above definitions, set up the coupled ordinary differential equations for the parent $^{51}\\mathrm{V}$, and the daughters $^{52}\\mathrm{V}$ and $^{48}\\mathrm{Sc}$ under constant flux $\\phi$, with microscopic cross sections $\\sigma_{\\gamma}$ and $\\sigma_{\\alpha}$ in barns for $(\\mathrm{n},\\gamma)$ and $(\\mathrm{n},\\alpha)$, respectively.\n- Solve these equations analytically to obtain closed-form expressions for the number of daughter nuclei $N_{d}(t)$ at end of irradiation time $t$, and then express the activities $A_{d}(t) = \\lambda_{d} N_{d}(t)$ for $^{52}\\mathrm{V}$ and $^{48}\\mathrm{Sc}$, where the decay constants are $\\lambda_{52} = \\dfrac{\\ln 2}{t_{1/2,52}}$ and $\\lambda_{48} = \\dfrac{\\ln 2}{t_{1/2,48}}$. Your derivation must handle the nonzero removal of the parent by reactions and must be valid for all times $t \\ge 0$. If a limiting case arises where a denominator $\\left(\\lambda_{d} - R\\right)$ tends to zero, where $R$ is the total removal rate of the parent by reactions, derive and use the correct limiting expression.\n- Convert barns to cm$^{2}$ using $1$ barn $= 10^{-24}$ cm$^{2}$. Compute the initial number of $^{51}\\mathrm{V}$ target atoms from the given mass $m$ (in kilograms) using $N_{0} = \\left(\\dfrac{m \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{g}}{50.9415\\ \\mathrm{g/mol}}\\right) N_{\\mathrm{A}} \\times 0.9975$.\n\nData for nuclides:\n- $^{52}\\mathrm{V}$ half-life $t_{1/2,52} = 224.6$ s.\n- $^{48}\\mathrm{Sc}$ half-life $t_{1/2,48} = 1.57212\\times 10^{5}$ s.\n\nYou must implement these derivations as an algorithm and compute the end-of-irradiation activities in Becquerel for the following test suite. All times must be used in seconds, all masses in kilograms, all fluxes in n cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and all cross sections in barns.\n\nTest suite (each case specifies $(m,\\ \\phi,\\ \\sigma_{\\gamma},\\ \\sigma_{\\alpha},\\ t)$):\n- Case T1 (thermal, long irradiation): $(1.0,\\ 1.0\\times 10^{13},\\ 5.0,\\ 1.0\\times 10^{-6},\\ 7\\times 86400)$.\n- Case F1 (fast, long irradiation): $(1.0,\\ 1.0\\times 10^{14},\\ 0.10,\\ 0.020,\\ 30\\times 86400)$.\n- Case Tshort (thermal, short irradiation): $(1.0,\\ 1.0\\times 10^{13},\\ 5.0,\\ 1.0\\times 10^{-6},\\ 3600)$.\n- Case ZeroFlux (edge case): $(1.0,\\ 0.0,\\ 0.10,\\ 0.020,\\ 10\\times 86400)$.\n\nFor each case, compute the end-of-irradiation activities in Becquerel for both $^{52}\\mathrm{V}$ and $^{48}\\mathrm{Sc}$. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets in the following order: $[A_{52,\\mathrm{T1}}, A_{48,\\mathrm{T1}}, A_{52,\\mathrm{F1}}, A_{48,\\mathrm{F1}}, A_{52,\\mathrm{Tshort}}, A_{48,\\mathrm{Tshort}}, A_{52,\\mathrm{ZeroFlux}}, A_{48,\\mathrm{ZeroFlux}}]$. Each value must be expressed in scientific notation with exactly six digits after the decimal point, in Becquerel (s$^{-1}$).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of radionuclide activities in an idealized vanadium alloy after irradiation. The solution involves setting up and solving a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the time evolution of the number of atoms for the parent nuclide ($^{51}\\mathrm{V}$) and the daughter products ($^{52}\\mathrm{V}$ and $^{48}\\mathrm{Sc}$).\n\nLet $N_{51}(t)$, $N_{52}(t)$, and $N_{48}(t)$ be the number of atoms of $^{51}\\mathrm{V}$, $^{52}\\mathrm{V}$, and $^{48}\\mathrm{Sc}$ at time $t$, respectively. The parent nuclide, $^{51}\\mathrm{V}$, is stable, so its intrinsic decay constant is zero. It is, however, removed (transmuted) by two neutron capture reactions: $(\\mathrm{n},\\gamma)$ and $(\\mathrm{n},\\alpha)$. The problem assumes a constant neutron flux $\\phi$ and homogeneous conditions.\n\nThe rate equation for the parent nuclide $^{51}\\mathrm{V}$ is given by its rate of removal:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{51}(t)}{dt} = - \\phi \\sigma_{\\gamma} N_{51}(t) - \\phi \\sigma_{\\alpha} N_{51}(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\gamma}$ and $\\sigma_{\\alpha}$ are the microscopic cross sections for the $(\\mathrm{n},\\gamma)$ and $(\\mathrm{n},\\alpha)$ reactions, respectively. We can define a total removal rate constant, $R$, as:\n$$\nR = \\phi (\\sigma_{\\gamma} + \\sigma_{\\alpha})\n$$\nThe units of $R$ are $s^{-1}$, provided $\\phi$ is in $n \\cdot cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ and $\\sigma$ is in $cm^2$. The ODE for $N_{51}(t)$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{51}(t)}{dt} = -R N_{51}(t)\n$$\nWith the initial condition $N_{51}(0) = N_0$, the solution to this equation is:\n$$\nN_{51}(t) = N_0 e^{-Rt}\n$$\n$N_0$ is the initial number of $^{51}\\mathrm{V}$ atoms, calculated from the given mass $m$ (in $kg$) of natural vanadium:\n$$\nN_0 = \\left(\\frac{m \\times 10^3 \\text{ g}}{M_V \\text{ g/mol}}\\right) N_{\\mathrm{A}} f_{51}\n$$\nwhere $M_V = 50.9415 \\text{ g/mol}$ is the atomic weight of vanadium, $N_{\\mathrm{A}} = 6.02214076\\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1}$ is Avogadro's number, and $f_{51} = 0.9975$ is the natural isotopic abundance of $^{51}\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe daughter nuclides are produced by the reactions on $^{51}\\mathrm{V}$ and are removed by their own radioactive decay. Let's formulate a general equation for a daughter nuclide $d$ produced with cross section $\\sigma_p$ and decaying with a decay constant $\\lambda_d$.\nThe rate equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_d(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Production Rate}) - (\\text{Decay Rate}) = \\phi \\sigma_p N_{51}(t) - \\lambda_d N_d(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the solution for $N_{51}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_d(t)}{dt} = \\phi \\sigma_p N_0 e^{-Rt} - \\lambda_d N_d(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous ODE. Rearranging it into standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_d(t)}{dt} + \\lambda_d N_d(t) = \\phi \\sigma_p N_0 e^{-Rt}\n$$\nWe solve this using an integrating factor $I(t) = e^{\\int \\lambda_d dt} = e^{\\lambda_d t}$. Multiplying by $I(t)$:\n$$\ne^{\\lambda_d t} \\frac{dN_d(t)}{dt} + \\lambda_d e^{\\lambda_d t} N_d(t) = \\phi \\sigma_p N_0 e^{-Rt} e^{\\lambda_d t}\n$$\nThe left side is the derivative of $N_d(t)e^{\\lambda_d t}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(N_d(t)e^{\\lambda_d t}\\right) = \\phi \\sigma_p N_0 e^{(\\lambda_d - R)t}\n$$\nIntegrating from $t'=0$ to $t'=t$, with the initial condition $N_d(0) = 0$:\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\frac{d}{dt'}\\left(N_d(t')e^{\\lambda_d t'}\\right) dt' = \\int_0^t \\phi \\sigma_p N_0 e^{(\\lambda_d - R)t'} dt'\n$$\n$$\nN_d(t)e^{\\lambda_d t} - N_d(0)e^0 = \\phi \\sigma_p N_0 \\left[ \\frac{e^{(\\lambda_d - R)t'}}{\\lambda_d - R} \\right]_0^t\n$$\nThis assumes $\\lambda_d \\neq R$. Substituting $N_d(0)=0$:\n$$\nN_d(t)e^{\\lambda_d t} = \\frac{\\phi \\sigma_p N_0}{\\lambda_d - R} (e^{(\\lambda_d - R)t} - 1)\n$$\nSolving for $N_d(t)$ by multiplying by $e^{-\\lambda_d t}$:\n$$\nN_d(t) = \\frac{\\phi \\sigma_p N_0}{\\lambda_d - R} (e^{-Rt} - e^{-\\lambda_d t})\n$$\nThe activity $A_d(t)$ is defined as $A_d(t) = \\lambda_d N_d(t)$, so for the general case ($\\lambda_d \\neq R$):\n$$\nA_d(t) = \\frac{\\lambda_d \\phi \\sigma_p N_0}{\\lambda_d - R} (e^{-Rt} - e^{-\\lambda_d t})\n$$\nSpecial case: if $\\lambda_d = R$, the denominator in the integration step is zero. We must re-integrate:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(N_d(t)e^{\\lambda_d t}\\right) = \\phi \\sigma_p N_0 e^{(\\lambda_d - R)t} = \\phi \\sigma_p N_0 e^{0} = \\phi \\sigma_p N_0\n$$\nIntegrating from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\nN_d(t)e^{\\lambda_d t} = \\phi \\sigma_p N_0 t\n$$\n$$\nN_d(t) = \\phi \\sigma_p N_0 t e^{-\\lambda_d t}\n$$\nThe activity in this special case is:\n$$\nA_d(t) = \\lambda_d N_d(t) = \\lambda_d \\phi \\sigma_p N_0 t e^{-\\lambda_d t}\n$$\nThese derived formulae are implemented to solve the problem for the two specified daughters:\n1. For $^{52}\\mathrm{V}$: the production cross section is $\\sigma_p = \\sigma_{\\gamma}$ and the decay constant is $\\lambda_d = \\lambda_{52} = \\frac{\\ln{2}}{t_{1/2,52}} = \\frac{\\ln{2}}{224.6 \\text{ s}}$.\n2. For $^{48}\\mathrm{Sc}$: the production cross section is $\\sigma_p = \\sigma_{\\alpha}$ and the decay constant is $\\lambda_d = \\lambda_{48} = \\frac{\\ln{2}}{t_{1/2,48}} = \\frac{\\ln{2}}{1.57212 \\times 10^5 \\text{ s}}$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case $(m, \\phi, \\sigma_{\\gamma}, \\sigma_{\\alpha}, t)$:\n1. Calculate the initial number of $^{51}\\mathrm{V}$ atoms, $N_0$.\n2. Convert cross sections from barns to $cm^2$ using the factor $1 \\text{ barn} = 10^{-24} \\text{ cm}^2$.\n3. Compute the parent removal rate constant $R = \\phi (\\sigma_{\\gamma} + \\sigma_{\\alpha})$.\n4. For each daughter nuclide ($^{52}\\mathrm{V}$ and $^{48}\\mathrm{Sc}$), determine its decay constant $\\lambda_d$ and production cross section $\\sigma_p$.\n5. A check is performed to see if $\\lambda_d$ and $R$ are numerically close. Based on the outcome, the appropriate formula (general or special case) is used to compute the activity $A_d(t)$.\n6. The final activities are formatted and presented in the required order. For the zero flux case, production is zero, so the final activity is correctly evaluated to be $0$.",

The inverse-square law for isotropic emission: for an isotropic source with photon emission rate proportional to activity, the uncollided fluence rate at distance $r$ in free space scales as $r^{-2}$.\n2. The exponential attenuation (Beer–Lambert law) for narrow-beam transmission: an uncollided beam of photons passing through a homogeneous slab of thickness $x$ is reduced by a factor $\\exp(-\\mu x)$, where $\\mu$ is the linear attenuation coefficient.\n\nWe proceed in two steps: relate activity to unshielded dose rate at distance $r$, and then include attenuation by the shield.\n\nLet $Q$ denote the activity in $\\mathrm{Bq}$, which is the disintegration rate in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. For an isotropic emitter, the uncollided fluence rate at distance $r$ is\n$$\n\\dot{\\Phi}(r) = \\frac{Y Q}{4\\pi r^{2}},\n$$\nwhere $Y$ is the average yield of emitted photons per disintegration (photons per disintegration).

By deriving and applying the radioactive decay law, you will determine the necessary 'cooling time', a key parameter that dictates waste classification, storage requirements, and the long-term sustainability of the fusion fuel cycle.",

            "problem": "A decommissioned first-wall panel from a fusion device is dominated by a single activation product whose radioactive decay is well modeled as a first-order process. Let $N(t)$ denote the number of radioactive nuclei at time $t$ and let $A(t)$ denote the activity at time $t$, defined as the expected number of decays per unit time. At the end of operation (taken as $t=0$), a measurement establishes an initial total activity $A_0 = 2.5 \\times 10^9$ in $\\mathrm{Bq}$. The component mass is $m = 500$ in $\\mathrm{kg}$. The isotope half-life is $T_{1/2} = 5.271$ in $\\mathrm{y}$, and the regulator’s clearance criterion for unconditional release is specified as a mass-specific activity less than $L_{\\mathrm{cl}} = 0.5$ in $\\mathrm{Bq\\,kg^{-1}}$. Assume no additional production (ingrowth) and no removal other than spontaneous radioactive decay, and neglect any chemical or physical loss mechanisms.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of radioactive decay as a Markovian process with a constant decay probability per unit time and the definition of activity $A(t) = -\\mathrm{d}N/\\mathrm{d}t$, derive the time evolution of $A(t)$ and determine the minimum cooling time $t_{\\mathrm{clear}}$ such that the component’s specific activity $A(t)/m$ is strictly less than $L_{\\mathrm{cl}}$. Express your final numerical answer for $t_{\\mathrm{clear}}$ in $\\mathrm{y}$ and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimum cooling time, $t_{\\mathrm{clear}}$, for a radioactive component to meet a specific activity clearance criterion. The decay process is described as a first-order, Markovian process.\n\nThe fundamental postulate for such a process is that the rate of decay of radioactive nuclei is directly proportional to the number of nuclei, $N(t)$, present at time $t$. This is expressed by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\lambda N(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the decay constant, representing the probability per unit time that a single nucleus will decay.\n\nThe activity, $A(t)$, is defined as the expected number of decays per unit time, which is the negative of the rate of change of the number of nuclei:\n$$\nA(t) = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\nSubstituting the first equation into the definition of activity yields a direct relationship between activity and the number of nuclei:\n$$\nA(t) = \\lambda N(t)\n$$\nTo find the time evolution of the activity, we differentiate this expression with respect to time:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\lambda \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\lambda N(t)$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\lambda (-\\lambda N(t)) = -\\lambda (\\lambda N(t))\n$$\nSince $A(t) = \\lambda N(t)$, we arrive at the differential equation for activity:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\lambda A(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A}{A} = -\\lambda \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a later time $t$, and from the initial activity $A(0) = A_0$ to $A(t)$, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{A_0}^{A(t)} \\frac{1}{A'} \\mathrm{d}A' = \\int_0^t -\\lambda \\mathrm{d}t'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(A(t)) - \\ln(A_0) = -\\lambda t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{A(t)}{A_0}\\right) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the law of radioactive decay for activity:\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nThe decay constant $\\lambda$ is related to the half-life, $T_{1/2}$. By definition, at $t=T_{1/2}$, the activity is reduced to half its initial value, $A(T_{1/2}) = A_0/2$. Substituting this into the decay law:\n$$\n\\frac{A_0}{2} = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda T_{1/2})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-\\lambda T_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\lambda T_{1/2} \\implies -\\ln(2) = -\\lambda T_{1/2}\n$$\nThus, the decay constant is given by:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a clearance criterion based on the mass-specific activity, which is the total activity $A(t)$ divided by the component mass $m$. The specific activity at time $t$ is $S(t) = A(t)/m$. The clearance condition is:\n$$\nS(t_{\\mathrm{clear}}) < L_{\\mathrm{cl}}\n$$\nwhere $L_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ is the regulatory clearance limit. To find the minimum cooling time, we solve for the time $t_{\\mathrm{clear}}$ at which the specific activity is equal to the clearance limit:\n$$\n\\frac{A(t_{\\mathrm{clear}})}{m} = L_{\\mathrm{cl}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t_{\\mathrm{clear}})}{m} = L_{\\mathrm{cl}}\n$$\nWe now solve for $t_{\\mathrm{clear}}$:\n$$\n\\exp(-\\lambda t_{\\mathrm{clear}}) = \\frac{m L_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{A_0}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\lambda t_{\\mathrm{clear}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{m L_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{A_0}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{m L_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{A_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_0}{m L_{\\mathrm{cl}}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} = \\frac{T_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_0}{m L_{\\mathrm{cl}}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$A_0 = 2.5 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{Bq}$\n$m = 500 \\mathrm{kg}$\n$L_{\\mathrm{cl}} = 0.5 \\mathrm{Bq\\,kg^{-1}}$\n$T_{1/2} = 5.271 \\mathrm{y}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total activity limit for the component:\n$$\nm L_{\\mathrm{cl}} = (500) \\times (0.5) = 250 \\mathrm{Bq}\n$$\nNext, we determine the required reduction factor, which is the ratio of the initial activity to the target activity:\n$$\n\\frac{A_0}{m L_{\\mathrm{cl}}} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^9}{250} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^9}{2.5 \\times 10^2} = 10^7\n$$\nNow we can calculate $t_{\\mathrm{clear}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} = \\frac{5.271 \\mathrm{y}}{\\ln(2)} \\ln(10^7)\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(x^p) = p \\ln(x)$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} = \\frac{5.271 \\times 7 \\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)} \\mathrm{y}\n$$\nUsing the standard values $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$ and $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} \\approx \\frac{5.271 \\times 7 \\times 2.302585}{0.693147} \\mathrm{y}\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} \\approx \\frac{84.97825}{0.693147} \\mathrm{y}\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} \\approx 122.598 \\mathrm{y}\n$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{clear}} \\approx 122.6 \\mathrm{y}\n$$\nThis is the minimum time required for the mass-specific activity to fall to the level of $L_{\\mathrm{cl}}$. To be strictly less than $L_{\\mathrm{cl}}$, the cooling time must be greater than this value. However, the problem asks for the minimum cooling time such that the condition is met, which is conventionally interpreted as finding this boundary value.",
