This first practice uses a fundamental energy balance approach, often called a '0D' or lumped-parameter model, to estimate the average heat flux during this event. By treating the plasma's total thermal energy as a single reservoir emptied over a characteristic time onto a specific area, you will perform a crucial 'back-of-the-envelope' calculation  that reveals the immense power densities that plasma-facing components must survive.",

            "problem": "A magnetically confined fusion plasma in a tokamak undergoes a thermal quench (TQ), rapidly losing its thermal energy to the plasma-facing components (PFCs). Consider a disruption scenario in which the pre-TQ thermal energy content is modeled as a single lumped thermal reservoir of magnitude $W_{th}$, which is exhausted over a characteristic TQ timescale $\\tau_{TQ}$ predominantly onto a single divertor target with a modeled wetted area $A_{wet}$. Starting from conservation of energy and the definition of surface heat flux as energy per unit area per unit time, derive a minimal upper-bound estimate of the peak target heat flux $q_{peak}$ based on the assumptions that (i) the deposition is localized to the area $A_{wet}$, (ii) the temporal waveform is a square pulse of duration $\\tau_{TQ}$, and (iii) the spatial footprint is uniform across $A_{wet}$.

The concepts of thermal energy, thermal quench timescale, wetted area, and heat flux are standard in fusion engineering. The numerical values are of a plausible order of magnitude for a large-scale fusion device. The assumptions, while idealized, represent a standard \"0D\" modeling approach used for engineering estimates. The problem is a direct application of conservation of energy.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($W_{th}$, $\\tau_{TQ}$, $A_{wet}$) and a set of simplifying assumptions that are sufficient to derive a unique, meaningful estimate for the peak heat flux, $q_{peak}$.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard terminology from the field of fusion science. The assumptions are explicitly stated and unambiguous.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It represents a a standard estimation problem in applied physics and engineering. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental definitions of power and heat flux. Surface heat flux, $q$, is defined as the power, $P$, delivered per unit area, $A$.\n$$\nq = \\frac{P}{A}\n$$\nPower, in turn, is defined as the rate of energy transfer, i.e., energy $E$ per unit time $t$.\n$$\nP = \\frac{E}{t}\n$$\nCombining these definitions, a general expression for heat flux is:\n$$\nq = \\frac{E}{A \\cdot t}\n$$\nWe now apply the specific parameters and assumptions of the problem. The total energy deposited is the pre-quench thermal energy, so $E = W_{th}$. The deposition is localized to the divertor target, so the relevant area is $A = A_{wet}$. The energy is deposited over the thermal quench timescale, so $t = \\tau_{TQ}$.\n\nThe problem makes two critical simplifying assumptions about the deposition profile:\n$1$. The temporal waveform is a square pulse of duration $\\tau_{TQ}$. This implies that the power deposition is constant during the time interval of the quench.\n$2$. The spatial footprint is uniform across $A_{wet}$. This implies that the heat flux is constant over the entire wetted area.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the peak power is equal to the average power, $P = \\frac{W_{th}}{\\tau_{TQ}}$, and the peak heat flux is equal to the average heat flux, $q_{peak} = \\frac{P}{A_{wet}}$. Substituting the expression for power, we arrive at the symbolic formula for the peak heat flux:\n$$\nq_{peak} = \\frac{W_{th}}{A_{wet} \\tau_{TQ}}\n$$\nThis expression represents a \"minimal upper-bound estimate.\" It is an upper bound because it assumes that $100\\%$ of the initial thermal energy $W_{th}$ is deposited onto the specified area $A_{wet}$, neglecting any energy loss through other channels (e.g., radiation to other vessel components). It is \"minimal\" in the sense that it is a simplified, averaged model; real-world heat flux profiles are typically peaked in both space and time, which would result in local peak heat fluxes significantly higher than this average value.\n\nThe problem explicitly requests a statement of implicit assumptions.\n$1$. All thermal energy $W_{th}$ is converted into a heat load on the area $A_{wet}$. This is a conservative assumption for an upper-bound estimate, as in reality, a fraction of the energy is radiated isotropically.\n$2$. The parameters $\\tau_{TQ}$ and $A_{wet}$ are static constants. In a real thermal quench, these quantities can evolve dynamically.\n$3$. The problem's \"peak target heat flux\" $q_{peak}$ is understood to be the peak value of the *modeled* heat flux. Since the model assumes a constant flux, this calculated value is an average flux over the specified time and area, not the true local maximum which would require knowledge of temporal and spatial peaking factors.\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into the derived expression.\n$$\nW_{th} = 2.2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{TQ} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\nA_{wet} = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\n$$\nThe peak heat flux is calculated as:\n$$\nq_{peak} = \\frac{2.2 \\times 10^{6}}{(1.1) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-3})} \\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$\n$$\nq_{peak} = \\frac{2.2 \\times 10^{6}}{1.65 \\times 10^{-3}} \\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$\n$$\nq_{peak} = \\left(\\frac{2.2}{1.65}\\right) \\times 10^{6 - (-3)} \\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$\nThe fraction simplifies:\n$$\n\\frac{2.2}{1.65} = \\frac{220}{165} = \\frac{44 \\times 5}{33 \\times 5} = \\frac{44}{33} = \\frac{4 \\times 11}{3 \\times 11} = \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\nThus, the exact value is:\n$$\nq_{peak} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 10^{9} \\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\approx 1.3333... \\times 10^{9} \\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of gigawatts per square meter ($\\mathrm{GW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$). Since $1\\,\\mathrm{GW} = 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{W}$, we have:\n$$\nq_{peak} \\approx 1.3333... \\,\\mathrm{GW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain:\n$$\nq_{peak} = 1.333 \\,\\mathrm{GW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$",

            "introduction": "Any physical model has a domain of validity, and the collisional conduction model is no exception.
