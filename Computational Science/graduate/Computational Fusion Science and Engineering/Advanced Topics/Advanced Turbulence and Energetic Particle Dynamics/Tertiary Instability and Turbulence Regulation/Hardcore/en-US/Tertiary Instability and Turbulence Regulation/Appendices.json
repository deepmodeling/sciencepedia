Derivation of the Dispersion Coefficient $\\alpha$**\n\nThe coefficient $\\alpha$ in the NLS equation represents group velocity dispersion. For an envelope modulation in the $x$-direction (with slow coordinate $X$), $\\alpha$ is given by one-half of the second derivative of the linear frequency $\\omega(\\boldsymbol{k})$ with respect to $k_x$, evaluated at the pump wavevector $\\boldsymbol{k}_0=(k_x, k_y)$.\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega}{\\partial k_x^2} \\bigg|_{\\boldsymbol{k}=\\boldsymbol{k}_0}\n$$\nThe linear dispersion relation is given as $\\omega(\\boldsymbol{k}) = k_y (1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2)^{-1}$. We compute the partial derivatives with respect to $k_x$.\n\nFirst derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial k_x} = k_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_x} (1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2)^{-1} = k_y \\left( -1 \\cdot (1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2)^{-2} \\cdot 2k_x \\right) = \\frac{-2 k_x k_y}{(1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2)^2}\n$$\n\nSecond derivative, using the quotient rule on the expression above:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega}{\\partial k_x^2} = -2k_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_x} \\left( \\frac{k_x}{(1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2)^2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega}{\\partial k_x^2} = -2k_y \\left( \\frac{1 \\cdot (1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2)^2 - k_x \\cdot 2(1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2) \\cdot 2k_x}{(1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2)^4} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega}{\\partial k_x^2} = -2k_y \\left( \\frac{(1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2) - 4k_x^2}{(1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2)^3} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega}{\\partial k_x^2} = -2k_y \\left( \\frac{1 - 3k_x^2 + k_y^2}{(1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2)^3} \\right) = \\frac{2k_y (3k_x^2 - k_y^2 - 1)}{(1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2)^3}\n$$\nThe coefficient $\\alpha$ is thus:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\omega}{\\partial k_x^2} = \\frac{k_y (3k_x^2 - k_y^2 - 1)}{(1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2)^3}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Modulational Instability Growth Rate $\\gamma(q)$**\n\nThe NLS equation with $\\beta=1$ is $i\\,\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T} + \\alpha\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} A}{\\partial X^{2}} + |A|^{2}A = 0$. We linearize this equation around the plane-wave solution $A_s(T) = A_0 \\exp(i |A_0|^2 T)$. Let the perturbed solution be $A(X,T) = (A_0 + \\delta A(X,T)) \\exp(i |A_0|^2 T)$. Substituting this into the NLS equation and retaining only terms linear in the perturbation $\\delta A$ gives the linearized equation for $\\delta A$. A simpler way is to transform into a frame rotating with the phase of the plane-wave solution. Let $A(X,T) = \\tilde{A}(X,T) \\exp(i |A_0|^2 T)$. The equation for $\\tilde{A}$ is:\n$$\ni \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{A}}{\\partial T} + i |A_0|^2 \\tilde{A} \\right) \\exp(i|A_0|^2 T) + \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{A}}{\\partial X^2} \\exp(i|A_0|^2 T) + |\\tilde{A}|^2 \\tilde{A} \\exp(i|A_0|^2 T) = 0\n$$\n$$\ni \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{A}}{\\partial T} - |A_0|^2 \\tilde{A} + \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{A}}{\\partial X^2} + |\\tilde{A}|^2 \\tilde{A} = 0\n$$\nNow, we write $\\tilde{A}(X,T) = A_0 + \\delta A(X,T)$ and linearize:\n$$\n|\\tilde{A}|^2 \\tilde{A} = |A_0 + \\delta A|^2 (A_0 + \\delta A) \\approx |A_0|^2 A_0 + 2|A_0|^2 \\delta A + A_0^2 \\delta A^*\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\tilde{A}$ and canceling the zeroth-order terms $(-|A_0|^2 A_0 + |A_0|^2 A_0=0)$, we obtain the linear equation for the perturbation $\\delta A$:\n$$\ni \\frac{\\partial (\\delta A)}{\\partial T} + \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\delta A)}{\\partial X^2} + |A_0|^2 \\delta A + A_0^2 \\delta A^* = 0\n$$\nWe seek solutions of the form $\\delta A(X,T) = a_1 e^{i q X + \\gamma T} + a_2 e^{-i q X + \\gamma T}$. However, the coupling term $A_0^2 \\delta A^*$ links the modes at $+q$ and $-q$. A more general ansatz is required:\n$$\n\\delta A(X,T) = (\\delta A_+ e^{i q X} + \\delta A_- e^{-i q X}) e^{\\gamma T}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the linearized equation yields two coupled algebraic equations for the amplitudes $\\delta A_+$ and $\\delta A_-^*$:\n$$\n(i \\gamma - \\alpha q^2 + |A_0|^2) \\delta A_+ + A_0^2 \\delta A_-^* = 0\n$$\n$$\n(i \\gamma - \\alpha q^2 + |A_0|^2) \\delta A_- + A_0^2 \\delta A_+^* = 0\n$$\nTaking the complex conjugate of the second equation and assuming a real growth rate $\\gamma$ gives:\n$$\n(-i \\gamma - \\alpha q^2 + |A_0|^2) \\delta A_-^* + (A_0^*)^2 \\delta A_+ = 0\n$$\nWe have a system of two linear equations for $\\delta A_+$ and $\\delta A_-^*$. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} i \\gamma - \\alpha q^2 + |A_0|^2 & A_0^2 \\\\ (A_0^*)^2 & -i \\gamma - \\alpha q^2 + |A_0|^2 \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(i \\gamma - \\alpha q^2 + |A_0|^2)(-i \\gamma - \\alpha q^2 + |A_0|^2) - |A_0|^4 = 0\n$$\nLet $W = \\alpha q^2 - |A_0|^2$. The equation becomes $(i\\gamma - W)(-i\\gamma - W) - |A_0|^4 = 0$.\n$$\n\\gamma^2 + W^2 - |A_0|^4 = 0 \\implies \\gamma^2 = |A_0|^4 - W^2 = |A_0|^4 - (\\alpha q^2 - |A_0|^2)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma^2 = (|A_0|^2 - (\\alpha q^2 - |A_0|^2))(|A_0|^2 + (\\alpha q^2 - |A_0|^2))\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma^2 = (2|A_0|^2 - \\alpha q^2)(\\alpha q^2)\n$$\nThe growth rate $\\gamma(q)$ is the positive square root of this expression:\n$$\n\\gamma(q) = \\sqrt{\\alpha q^2 (2|A_0|^2 - \\alpha q^2)}\n$$\n\n**3. Modulational Instability Condition**\n\nInstability occurs when the growth rate $\\gamma$ is real and positive, which requires $\\gamma^2 > 0$.\n$$\n\\alpha q^2 (2|A_0|^2 - \\alpha q^2) > 0\n$$\nThe problem states to assume the focusing condition, which for the NLS with $\\beta=1>0$ is $\\alpha > 0$. Since $q^2 > 0$, the term $\\alpha q^2$ is positive. The condition for instability thus becomes:\n$$\n2|A_0|^2 - \\alpha q^2 > 0 \\implies \\alpha q^2 < 2|A_0|^2\n$$\nThis inequality, `$\\alpha q^2 < 2|A_0|^2$`, together with the focusing condition $\\alpha > 0$, defines the range of unstable wavenumbers: $0 < q^2 < 2|A_0|^2 / \\alpha$.\n\n**4. Wavenumber of Fastest-Growing Mode, $q_\\ast$**\n\nTo find the wavenumber $q_\\ast$ that maximizes the growth rate $\\gamma(q)$, we can maximize its square, $\\gamma^2(q)$. Let $z = q^2$. We want to maximize the function $f(z) = \\alpha z (2|A_0|^2 - \\alpha z) = 2\\alpha|A_0|^2 z - \\alpha^2 z^2$ for $z > 0$. We find the critical point by setting the derivative with respect to $z$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dz} = 2\\alpha|A_0|^2 - 2\\alpha^2 z = 0\n$$\nSolving for $z$:\n$$\n2\\alpha^2 z = 2\\alpha|A_0|^2 \\implies z = \\frac{|A_0|^2}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis corresponds to the squared wavenumber of the fastest-growing mode:\n$$\nq_\\ast^2 = \\frac{|A_0|^2}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThe second derivative is $d^2f/dz^2 = -2\\alpha^2 < 0$ (since $\\alpha$ is real and non-zero), confirming this is a maximum. The wavenumber $q_\\ast$ is the positive square root:\n$$\nq_\\ast = \\sqrt{\\frac{|A_0|^2}{\\alpha}} = \\frac{|A_0|}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\alpha$ derived in the first step:\n$$\nq_\\ast = |A_0| \\left( \\frac{k_y (3k_x^2 - k_y^2 - 1)}{(1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2)^3} \\right)^{-1/2}\n$$\n$$\nq_\\ast = |A_0| \\sqrt{\\frac{(1 + k_x^2 + k_y^2)^3}{k_y (3k_x^2 - k_y^2 - 1)}}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the wavenumber of the fastest-growing tertiary instability, which is already in the normalized units of $\\rho_s^{-1}$ as per the problem's setup.",

The language is objective and precise.\n\nThere is, however, a subtle ambiguity in the definition of the collisional free-energy dissipation rate. The quantity $W(t)$ is real, so its time derivative must also be real. The perturbation $h$ is given as a complex function. The operator $C$ is a real differential operator. The provided expression, $\\int \\frac{h}{F_{0}}C[h]\\,d^{3}\\mathbf{R}\\,d^{3}\\mathbf{v}$, would in general evaluate to a complex number.

Substituting this into the evolution equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = \\gamma_{t} h - \\nu\\ell(\\ell+1)h = \\left(\\gamma_{t} - \\nu\\ell(\\ell+1)\\right)h\n$$\nThe term $\\gamma_{t}$ represents the growth rate of the mode amplitude, while the term $\\nu\\ell(\\ell+1)$ represents the collisional damping rate of the mode amplitude. Let's denote the damping rate by $\\gamma_d = \\nu\\ell(\\ell+1)$.\n\nSuppression of the tertiary growth occurs when the net growth rate is less than or equal to zero. The case of marginal growth, which defines the boundary between growth and suppression, corresponds to the net growth rate being exactly zero:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\text{net}} = \\gamma_{t} - \\gamma_{d} = 0\n$$\nThis condition occurs at a specific, critical value of the collision frequency, which we denote as $\\nu_c$. We set $\\nu = \\nu_c$ in the marginal stability condition:\n$$\n\\gamma_{t} - \\nu_{c}\\ell(\\ell+1) = 0\n$$\nSolving for the critical collisionality $\\nu_c$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\nu_{c} = \\frac{\\gamma_{t}}{\\ell(\\ell+1)}\n$$\nThis expression gives the minimum collision frequency required to exactly balance the tertiary growth rate for a mode with pitch-angle structure dominated by the Legendre polynomial of degree $\\ell$.\nThis result is consistent with our finding for the free energy evolution. The total time derivative of the free energy is $\\frac{dW}{dt} = \\left.\\frac{dW}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{drive}} + \\left.\\frac{dW}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{coll}}$. The drive term is $2\\gamma_t W$, and we found the collisional term to be $-2\\nu\\ell(\\ell+1)W$. Thus, $\\frac{dW}{dt} = 2(\\gamma_t - \\nu\\ell(\\ell+1))W$. Marginal stability ($dW/dt = 0$) once again leads to $\\gamma_t - \\nu_c\\ell(\\ell+1) = 0$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and computation of the Dimits shift, $ \\Delta \\kappa_D $, and a related sensitivity metric, $ S_r $, based on a reduced model for ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) turbulence. The solution proceeds by first deriving the analytical expressions from the provided definitions and then outlining the computational implementation.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the Dimits Shift $ \\Delta \\kappa_D $\n\nThe analysis begins with the definition of the nonlinear Dimits threshold, $ \\kappa_D $, which is determined by the balance between the maximum linear ITG growth rate, $ \\max_{k_y} \\gamma_L $, and the effective zonal-flow shearing rate, $ \\omega_E^{\\text{eff}} $. The condition is:\n$$ \\max_{k_y} \\gamma_L(k_y; \\kappa_D, \\hat{s}, q) = \\omega_E^{\\text{eff}}(\\kappa_D, \\hat{s}, q) $$\n\nFirst, we must find the maximum of the linear growth rate with respect to the perpendicular wavenumber $ k_y $. The linear growth rate is given by:\n$$ \\gamma_L(k_y; \\kappa, \\hat{s}, q) = \\gamma_0 \\left( \\kappa - \\kappa_{\\text{lin}}(\\hat{s}, q) \\right) f(k_y) $$\nwhere the shape factor, with the sound gyroradius $ \\rho_s = 1 $, is:\n$$ f(k_y) = \\frac{k_y}{1 + k_y^2} $$\nThe parameters $ \\gamma_0 $, $ \\kappa $, $ \\kappa_{\\text{lin}} $, $ \\hat{s} $, and $ q $ do not depend on $ k_y $. Therefore, maximizing $ \\gamma_L $ is equivalent to maximizing $ f(k_y) $. We find the maximum by taking the derivative of $ f(k_y) $ with respect to $ k_y $ and setting it to zero.\n$$ \\frac{df}{dk_y} = \\frac{d}{dk_y} \\left( \\frac{k_y}{1 + k_y^2} \\right) = \\frac{(1)(1 + k_y^2) - k_y(2k_y)}{(1 + k_y^2)^2} = \\frac{1 - k_y^2}{(1 + k_y^2)^2} $$\nSetting the derivative to zero, $ \\frac{df}{dk_y} = 0 $, implies the numerator must be zero:\n$$ 1 - k_y^2 = 0 $$\nSince $ k_y $ represents a wavenumber, it must be non-negative, so we take the positive root $ k_y = 1 $.\nThe maximum value of the shape factor is thus:\n$$ f_{\\max} = f(k_y=1) = \\frac{1}{1 + 1^2} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nSubstituting this maximum value back into the expression for the growth rate, we get:\n$$ \\max_{k_y} \\gamma_L(k_y; \\kappa, \\hat{s}, q) = \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_0 \\left( \\kappa - \\kappa_{\\text{lin}}(\\hat{s}, q) \\right) $$\n\nNow, we enforce the Dimits boundary condition at $ \\kappa = \\kappa_D $:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_0 \\left( \\kappa_D - \\kappa_{\\text{lin}}(\\hat{s}, q) \\right) = \\omega_E^{\\text{eff}}(\\kappa_D, \\hat{s}, q) $$\nSubstitute the given expression for $ \\omega_E^{\\text{eff}} $:\n$$ \\omega_E^{\\text{eff}}(\\kappa_D, \\hat{s}, q) = \\gamma_0 \\, c_Z \\, \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) \\left( \\kappa_D - \\kappa_{\\text{lin}}(\\hat{s}, q) \\right) - \\gamma_{\\text{ter}}(\\hat{s}, q; \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0}) $$\nThe equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_0 \\left( \\kappa_D - \\kappa_{\\text{lin}} \\right) = \\gamma_0 \\, c_Z \\, \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) \\left( \\kappa_D - \\kappa_{\\text{lin}} \\right) - \\gamma_{\\text{ter}} $$\nWe are asked to find the Dimits upshift, defined as $ \\Delta \\kappa_D \\equiv \\kappa_D - \\kappa_{\\text{lin}} $. Substituting this definition into the equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_0 \\, \\Delta \\kappa_D = \\gamma_0 \\, c_Z \\, \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) \\, \\Delta \\kappa_D - \\gamma_{\\text{ter}} $$\nNow, we solve for $ \\Delta \\kappa_D $ by rearranging the terms:\n$$ \\gamma_{\\text{ter}} = \\gamma_0 \\, c_Z \\, \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) \\, \\Delta \\kappa_D - \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_0 \\, \\Delta \\kappa_D $$\n$$ \\gamma_{\\text{ter}} = \\Delta \\kappa_D \\left( \\gamma_0 \\, c_Z \\, \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) - \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_0 \\right) $$\n$$ \\gamma_{\\text{ter}} = \\Delta \\kappa_D \\, \\gamma_0 \\left( c_Z \\, \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) $$\nThis gives the expression for the Dimits upshift:\n$$ \\Delta \\kappa_D = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{ter}}}{\\gamma_0 \\left( c_Z \\, \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)} $$\nSubstituting the full expressions for $ \\gamma_{\\text{ter}} $ and $ \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) $:\n$$ \\Delta \\kappa_D(\\hat{s}, q; \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0}) = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{ter},0} \\left( 1 + b_s \\lvert \\hat{s} \\rvert \\right) \\left( 1 + \\frac{b_q}{q} \\right)}{\\gamma_0 \\left( c_Z \\frac{1}{(1 + \\lvert \\hat{s} \\rvert)^{\\nu}} \\frac{q_0}{q_0 + q} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)} $$\n\n### Task 2: Criterion for $ \\Delta \\kappa_D = 0 $\n\nThe Dimits upshift $ \\Delta \\kappa_D $ must be a non-negative quantity, as it represents a shift *up* from the linear threshold. The derived expression for $ \\Delta \\kappa_D $ is a fraction. The numerator, $ \\gamma_{\\text{ter}} = \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0} ( 1 + b_s \\lvert \\hat{s} \\rvert ) ( 1 + b_q/q ) $, is strictly positive for the given positive constants and $ \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0} > 0 $. Therefore, the sign of $ \\Delta \\kappa_D $ is determined entirely by the sign of the denominator.\n\nA Dimits state can only be maintained if the zonal flow shearing is strong enough to suppress turbulence. In our model, this means the net generation of zonal flow shearing (the coefficient of $ \\Delta \\kappa_D $) must be positive. If the denominator is zero or negative, the model predicts a non-positive (or infinite) upshift, which is unphysical. This indicates the breakdown of the Dimits regime. In this case, turbulence is not suppressed by zonal flows, and the onset of significant transport occurs at the linear threshold, $ \\kappa_{\\text{lin}} $.\nThus, the nonlinear threshold collapses onto the linear one, $ \\kappa_D = \\kappa_{\\text{lin}} $, which implies $ \\Delta \\kappa_D = 0 $.\n\nThe criterion for this collapse is when the calculated $ \\Delta \\kappa_D $ would be non-positive. This occurs when the denominator is non-positive:\n$$ \\gamma_0 \\left( c_Z \\, \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\le 0 $$\nSince $ \\gamma_0 > 0 $, this simplifies to:\n$$ c_Z \\, \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) - \\frac{1}{2} \\le 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad c_Z \\, \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) \\le \\frac{1}{2} $$\nPhysically, this condition signifies that the efficacy of zonal flow generation, scaled by $ c_Z \\Phi $, is insufficient to overcome the drive for linear instability (represented by the term $ 1/2 $ from $ \\max f(k_y) $).\n\nTherefore, the complete expression for the physically meaningful Dimits shift is:\n$$ \\Delta \\kappa_D = \\max \\left( 0, \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{ter}}}{\\gamma_0 \\left( c_Z \\, \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)} \\right) $$\n\n### Task 3: The Sensitivity Metric $ S_r $\n\nThe sensitivity metric $ S_r $ is defined as:\n$$ S_r(\\hat{s}, q; \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0}) \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta \\kappa_D(\\hat{s}, q; r \\, \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0}) - \\Delta \\kappa_D(\\hat{s}, q; \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0})}{(r - 1)\\, \\Delta \\kappa_D(\\hat{s}, q; \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0})} $$\nwith the convention that $ S_r = 0 $ if $ \\Delta \\kappa_D(\\hat{s}, q; \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0}) = 0 $.\n\nLet's analyze this expression under the condition that $ \\Delta \\kappa_D > 0 $. This implies that the denominator $ C(\\hat{s}, q) = \\gamma_0 ( c_Z \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) - 1/2 ) $ is positive.\nFrom Task 1, we see that $ \\Delta \\kappa_D $ is directly proportional to $ \\gamma_{\\text{ter}} $, which is itself directly proportional to $ \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0} $. We can write:\n$$ \\Delta \\kappa_D(\\hat{s}, q; \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0}) = K(\\hat{s}, q) \\cdot \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0} $$\nwhere $ K(\\hat{s}, q) = \\frac{( 1 + b_s \\lvert \\hat{s} \\rvert ) ( 1 + b_q/q )}{C(\\hat{s}, q)} $ is a factor that depends on $ \\hat{s} $ and $ q $ but not on $ \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0} $.\n\nNow, consider the perturbed value $ \\Delta \\kappa_D(\\hat{s}, q; r \\, \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0}) $:\n$$ \\Delta \\kappa_D(\\hat{s}, q; r \\, \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0}) = K(\\hat{s}, q) \\cdot (r \\, \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0}) = r \\cdot \\left( K(\\hat{s}, q) \\cdot \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0} \\right) = r \\, \\Delta \\kappa_D(\\hat{s}, q; \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0}) $$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $ S_r $:\n$$ S_r = \\frac{r \\, \\Delta \\kappa_D - \\Delta \\kappa_D}{(r - 1)\\, \\Delta \\kappa_D} = \\frac{(r - 1) \\, \\Delta \\kappa_D}{(r - 1)\\, \\Delta \\kappa_D} $$\nFor $ r \\ne 1 $ and $ \\Delta \\kappa_D \\ne 0 $, this simplifies to:\n$$ S_r = 1 $$\n\nWe must combine this result with the provided convention and the result from Task 2.\n1. If $ c_Z \\, \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) - \\frac{1}{2} \\le 0 $, then $ \\Delta \\kappa_D = 0 $. By convention, $ S_r = 0 $.\n2. If $ c_Z \\, \\Phi(\\hat{s}, q) - \\frac{1}{2} > 0 $, then $ \\Delta \\kappa_D > 0 $. In this case, our derivation shows $ S_r = 1 $.\n\nSo, the sensitivity metric $ S_r $ acts as a binary indicator for the existence of a non-zero Dimits shift in this model. It is $ 1 $ if a Dimits shift exists and $ 0 $ otherwise.\n\n### Summary for Implementation\n\nFor each case $ (\\hat{s}, q, \\gamma_{\\text{ter},0}) $:\n1.
