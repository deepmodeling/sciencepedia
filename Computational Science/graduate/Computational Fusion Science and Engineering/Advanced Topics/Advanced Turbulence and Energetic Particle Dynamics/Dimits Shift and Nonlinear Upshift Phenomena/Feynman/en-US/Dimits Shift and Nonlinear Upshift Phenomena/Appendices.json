They seek to quantify the Dimits shift, defined as the nonlinear upshift in the critical ion temperature gradient needed to sustain turbulence due to self-generated zonal flows. The control parameter is the dimensionless drive $x = a/L_{Ti}$, where $L_{Ti} = -(\\mathrm{d} \\ln T_i/\\mathrm{d}r)^{-1}$ and $a$ is the minor radius. The goal is to detect the nonlinear threshold $x_c$ via bisection in $x$ and to quantify uncertainty arising from finite simulation durations.\n\nBecause zonal flows can induce long quiescent transients near threshold, runs are limited to a maximum wall-clock time and a corresponding physical time $T_{\\max}$ in normalized units.

Which protocol is most appropriate to produce an unbiased estimate of $x_c$ with a defensible uncertainty, given the physics of the nonlinear upshift and the computational constraints?\n\nA.

Define a decision rule for bisection: if the lower bound of the interval for $p_T(x)$ exceeds $1/2$, classify the point as “sustained” and move the lower bracket up; if the upper bound is below $1/2$, classify as “quenched” and move the upper bracket down; otherwise, increase $R$ or $T_{\\max}(x)$ until a decision is possible.
