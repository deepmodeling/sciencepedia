## Introduction
Understanding and controlling [microturbulence](@entry_id:1127893)—the fine-scale, chaotic fluctuations in density and temperature—is one of the most critical challenges in the quest for fusion energy. This turbulence drives the transport of heat and particles out of the hot plasma core, directly limiting the efficiency and economic viability of magnetic confinement devices like tokamaks. To predict and mitigate this transport, scientists rely on complex simulations based on the gyrokinetic framework. However, a fundamental choice in this framework exists between computationally efficient *local* models and more comprehensive but expensive *global* models.

This article addresses the knowledge gap between these two paradigms, focusing on the crucial "global effects" that are missed by local approximations. While local models provide invaluable insight, they break down in many modern high-performance scenarios where the simplifying assumption of scale separation is no longer valid. By delving into the physics of global effects, we can understand phenomena that are central to achieving better [plasma confinement](@entry_id:203546), such as the formation of [transport barriers](@entry_id:756132) and the nonlocal spreading of turbulence.

Across the following chapters, you will gain a deep understanding of this advanced topic. The "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter will lay the theoretical foundation, contrasting the local and global formulations and detailing the physical conditions that necessitate a global approach. In "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," we will explore how these principles manifest in real-world tokamak experiments, their role in multi-scale physics, and their surprising parallels in astrophysics. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section will provide computational exercises to solidify your understanding of key concepts like shear suppression and [turbulence spreading](@entry_id:1133499). We begin by examining the core principles that distinguish the local and global views of [microturbulence](@entry_id:1127893).

## Principles and Mechanisms

The study of microturbulence in magnetically [confined plasmas](@entry_id:1122875), such as those in tokamaks, is foundational to predicting and improving the [energy confinement](@entry_id:1124454) properties of fusion devices. While a complete description of [plasma dynamics](@entry_id:185550) is embodied in the Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations, its direct solution is computationally intractable. The gyrokinetic framework, which averages over the fast gyromotion of charged particles, provides a reduced yet highly accurate model for the low-frequency turbulence that dominates transport. Within this framework, a critical conceptual and computational divide exists between *local* and *global* models. This chapter elucidates the principles and mechanisms that distinguish these two paradigms, focusing on the "global effects" that arise when the simplifying assumptions of locality are relaxed.

### The Local versus Global Paradigms in Gyrokinetics

The divergence between local and global models stems from a fundamental assumption regarding the [separation of scales](@entry_id:270204). Both models begin with the [gyrokinetic ordering](@entry_id:1125860), which assumes that the characteristic turbulence scales—perpendicular length scale $\rho_i$ (the ion Larmor radius) and frequency $\omega$—are small compared to the macroscopic device scales—minor radius $a$ and ion [cyclotron frequency](@entry_id:156231) $\Omega_i$. This is often expressed through the small parameter $\rho_* = \rho_i / a \ll 1$.

The **local approximation**, also known as the **[flux-tube model](@entry_id:1125143)**, introduces a secondary, more stringent assumption: that the radial [correlation length](@entry_id:143364) of the turbulence, $l_r$, is much smaller than the scale lengths over which the background [plasma equilibrium](@entry_id:184963) varies, $L_X = |X / (dX/dr)|$. This is the condition $l_r \ll L_X$ for all relevant equilibrium quantities $X(r)$, such as density $n_0(r)$, temperature $T_0(r)$, and safety factor $q(r)$.

Under this locality assumption, a simulation can be performed in a small "tube" of flux surfaces centered on a single reference radius, $r = r_0$. Within this narrow domain, the following approximations are made :
- **Equilibrium Profiles:** The background profiles of density, temperature, and electric field are treated as having constant gradients. These constant gradients, such as $\partial_r T_0|_{r_0}$, provide a spatially uniform free-energy source that drives the turbulence.
- **Magnetic Geometry:** All geometric quantities—including the safety factor $q$, magnetic shear $\hat{s} \equiv (r/q) dq/dr$, magnetic field strength $B$, and metric coefficients from [plasma shaping](@entry_id:753509)—are "frozen" at their values at $r_0$. Their radial variation across the simulation domain is neglected.
- **Boundary Conditions:** The small radial domain and assumption of homogeneity justify the use of periodic-like boundary conditions. In the radial direction, this is realized as the "twist-and-shift" condition, which maps the domain back onto itself in a way that respects the sheared nature of the magnetic field.

The **global gyrokinetic formulation**, in contrast, relaxes the assumption of scale separation between turbulence and equilibrium profiles. It is designed to capture phenomena where $l_r$ may become comparable to $L_X$, or where the turbulence structure extends over a significant fraction of the machine radius. A global model is characterized by the following features :
- **Simulation Domain:** The simulation is performed over a large radial domain, often spanning a substantial portion of the minor radius, $\Delta r \sim \mathcal{O}(a)$.
- **Equilibrium Profiles and Geometry:** The full radial dependence of all equilibrium profiles—$n_0(r)$, $T_0(r)$, the radial electric field $E_r(r)$, $q(r)$, $\hat{s}(r)$, etc.—is retained. Consequently, the turbulence drives and their stabilizing counterparts, like the $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ [velocity shear](@entry_id:267235), are functions of radius. Likewise, the radial variation of all geometric and metric quantities, including those related to [plasma shaping](@entry_id:753509) (e.g., Shafranov shift, elongation), is fully included.
- **Operators and Equations:** Because the metric and field quantities depend on radius, the [differential operators](@entry_id:275037) in the gyrokinetic equations (e.g., the perpendicular Laplacian $\nabla_\perp^2$ and divergence operators) contain coefficients that are functions of radius. This correctly accounts for the geometric effects of radially varying plasma shape and field strength.
- **Boundary Conditions:** The large radial domain represents a physical portion of the device, necessitating non-periodic radial boundary conditions. These are typically chosen to be physically motivated, such as Dirichlet or Neumann conditions at a boundary, or are implemented as artificial "absorbing" or "buffer" layers to prevent unphysical reflections of waves at the domain edge.

### The Breakdown of Locality: Sources of Global Effects

The computationally efficient [flux-tube model](@entry_id:1125143) is a powerful tool, but its validity is circumscribed. Global models become necessary when the foundational assumption of scale separation, $l_r/L_X \ll 1$, is violated. Understanding the physical conditions that lead to this breakdown is key to identifying the origins of global effects. Several distinct mechanisms can invalidate the local approximation :

1.  **Steep Gradient Regions:** In certain regions of a tokamak, such as the H-mode pedestal or [internal transport barriers](@entry_id:750756) (ITBs), the pressure gradient becomes extremely steep. This implies that the gradient scale length, $L_T = |T/(dT/dr)|$, becomes very small, potentially approaching the scale of the turbulent eddies themselves, $l_r$. When $L_T \sim l_r$, the driving gradient varies significantly across an eddy, a non-local effect that the constant-gradient [flux-tube model](@entry_id:1125143) cannot capture.

2.  **Finite Orbit Width (FOW) Effects:** Charged particles, particularly those trapped in magnetic wells, do not remain on a single flux surface. A trapped ion executes a "banana" orbit with a characteristic radial width $\Delta_b \sim \rho_i q / \sqrt{r/R}$. In regions of steep gradients, this orbit width can become comparable to the gradient scale length, $\Delta_b \gtrsim L_T$. When this occurs, the particle's motion averages over a region of significantly different plasma parameters, introducing an intrinsic [non-locality](@entry_id:140165) to the kinetic dynamics that is absent in the local model.

3.  **Radial Variation of Magnetic Geometry:** The local model assumes that geometric quantities like the magnetic shear $\hat{s}(r)$ are constant. However, if the shear itself varies significantly over the radial extent of an eddy—a condition quantified by $|d\hat{s}/dr| l_r \gtrsim |\hat{s}|$, for instance—the underlying ballooning structure of the instability is altered. This "[profile shearing](@entry_id:1130216)" of the magnetic geometry constitutes a global effect that can change mode stability and structure .

4.  **Formation of Meso-scale Structures:** Under certain conditions, turbulence can self-organize into radially elongated structures, often called **streamers** or **avalanches**, whose radial correlation length $l_r$ is much larger than the microscopic scale $\rho_i$. Such structures fundamentally violate the locality assumption and represent a form of [non-local transport](@entry_id:1128806) coupling that requires a global simulation domain to be described accurately.

### Global Effects on Linear Eigenmodes

In a global model, an instability is not a local property but a global [eigenmode](@entry_id:165358) of the system, characterized by a single [complex frequency](@entry_id:266400) $\omega$ and a two-dimensional [eigenfunction](@entry_id:149030) that spans a finite radial extent. The structure of this eigenmode is determined by the radial landscape of drive and damping.

#### The Radial Envelope Equation and the Ballooning Formalism

The complexity of toroidal geometry, particularly the twisting of magnetic field lines due to magnetic shear, is managed using the **ballooning representation**. This formalism shows that for a mode with a given binormal wavenumber $k_y$, the effective radial wavenumber $k_x$ varies along the magnetic field line (parameterized by the poloidal angle $\theta$), as $k_x(\theta) \approx k_{x0} + k_y \hat{s} \theta$. This affects key physical parameters, such as the perpendicular wavenumber $k_\perp(\theta)$, which in turn influences drive and damping mechanisms.

In a global context where equilibrium parameters like $\hat{s}(r)$ and the pressure gradient parameter $\alpha(r)$ (which controls the curvature drive) vary radially, the local properties of the instability also become functions of radius. This gives rise to a local dispersion relation, $\omega_{\mathrm{loc}}(k_y, r)$. Using a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) [multiple-scale analysis](@entry_id:270982), one can show that the global eigenmode takes the form of a fast-varying local ballooning structure multiplied by a slowly varying radial envelope, $A(r)$. This [envelope function](@entry_id:749028) satisfies a second-order ordinary differential equation, analogous to a one-dimensional Schrödinger equation :
$$
\frac{d^2 A}{dr^2} + \mathcal{Q}(r; \omega) A = 0
$$
The "potential" function $\mathcal{Q}(r; \omega)$ is determined by the mismatch between the global eigenfrequency $\omega$ and the local dispersion relation $\omega_{\mathrm{loc}}(r)$. The mode is radially trapped in regions where its envelope is oscillatory, and the width of this region determines the radial extent of the global eigenmode.

#### Influence of Profile Variation on Mode Structure

The radial profiles of equilibrium quantities directly shape the potential $\mathcal{Q}(r; \omega)$ and thus determine the global mode's structure and stability.
- **Weak Magnetic Shear:** In regions where the magnetic shear is weak or zero ($\hat{s}(r) \approx 0$), the stabilizing effect of shear is diminished. This creates a broad radial "[potential well](@entry_id:152140)" in which the [effective potential](@entry_id:142581) $\mathcal{Q}(r; \omega)$ can be positive over a large domain. As a result, eigenmodes, such as the Trapped Electron Mode (TEM), tend to form radially extended structures centered in these weak-shear regions. If the instability drive, which for TEMs is proportional to the trapped [electron fraction](@entry_id:159166) $f_t(r)$, is stronger in adjacent regions, this broad mode can tap into that remote drive, leading to a robust, non-local instability . This mechanism is crucial for understanding transport in advanced scenarios with reversed or weak magnetic shear.

- **Variation of Magnetic Shear:** The radial *gradient* of the magnetic shear, $d\hat{s}/dr$, also has a profound impact. In a radially uniform system, an instability like the Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) mode would have its structure perfectly aligned with the outboard midplane ($\theta=0$) to maximize the destabilizing "bad" curvature drive. However, a finite $d\hat{s}/dr$ breaks this [radial symmetry](@entry_id:141658). To form a coherent global structure, the eigenmode must adopt a "twist," characterized by a finite **ballooning angle** $\theta_0 \neq 0$. This structural adjustment is a compromise to maintain [phase coherence](@entry_id:142586) across the mode's radial width. Furthermore, a larger $|d\hat{s}/dr|$ tends to create a more confining radial potential, which localizes the eigenmode, narrows its radial width, and generally has a stabilizing effect, raising the [critical temperature gradient](@entry_id:748064) required for instability onset .

#### Convective vs. Absolute Instabilities in Inhomogeneous Plasmas

The concept of a global mode can be refined by distinguishing between **convective** and **absolute** instabilities, a classification based on the long-time response to a localized initial perturbation .
- A **[convective instability](@entry_id:199544)** is one where a [wave packet](@entry_id:144436) grows in amplitude as it propagates, but it moves away from its point of origin. An observer at a fixed position sees an initial pulse of activity that eventually decays as the growing packet moves on.
- An **absolute instability** is one where the perturbation grows exponentially in time at a fixed location.

The mathematical condition for an absolute instability, known as the Briggs-Bers criterion, is the existence of a "pinched saddle point" in the complex plane. Physically, this corresponds to finding a location $r_*$ and a [complex wavenumber](@entry_id:274896) $k_*$ where the [group velocity](@entry_id:147686) of the wave packet vanishes, $v_g = \partial \omega_r / \partial k = 0$. If an unstable mode ($\mathrm{Im}(\omega_*) > 0$) exists at this point of zero group velocity, the [wave packet](@entry_id:144436) cannot propagate away. It is "trapped" and will grow in place, leading to an absolute instability. The existence of such a local "potential well" created by the radial variation of plasma parameters is a quintessential global effect that can dramatically alter the nature of the instability.

### Global Effects in Nonlinear Dynamics and Transport

Global effects are not limited to the [linear phase](@entry_id:274637); they fundamentally alter the nonlinear saturation of turbulence and the resulting transport of heat and particles.

#### Regulation by Sheared Flows and Profile Shearing

Microturbulence is nonlinearly saturated primarily by the generation of self-organized, radially sheared $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ flows, which tear apart and decorrelate the turbulent eddies. The efficacy of this mechanism is determined by the **shearing rate**, $\gamma_E$. In a local model, $\gamma_E$ is treated as a constant parameter. A global perspective reveals that $\gamma_E(r)$ varies with radius, a phenomenon known as **[profile shearing](@entry_id:1130216)**.

Starting from the $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ drift velocity, $\mathbf{v}_{E} = \mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}/B^2$, the poloidal [angular frequency](@entry_id:274516) is $\omega_E(r) = E_r(r)/(rB(r))$. The shearing rate, which measures the [differential rotation](@entry_id:161059), is defined as $\gamma_E(r) = r \, d\omega_E/dr$. When an eddy has a finite radial width $\Delta r$, it experiences a variation in the shearing rate across its own structure, a "differential shear" of $\Delta\gamma_E \approx (d\gamma_E/dr)\Delta r$. This leads to a nonlinear twisting of the eddy, providing an additional dephasing mechanism that enhances the decorrelation of turbulence. This effect, which depends on the radial profile of $\gamma_E$, is an important global modification to the [nonlinear saturation](@entry_id:1128869) process .

#### The Role of Zonal Flows and Geodesic Acoustic Modes

The dominant sheared flows that regulate turbulence are themselves axisymmetric ($n=0$) structures generated by the turbulence. They manifest in two forms:
- **Zonal Flows (ZFs):** These are steady-state or very low-frequency ($\omega \approx 0$) radial electric fields and their associated poloidal shear flows. In a [collisionless plasma](@entry_id:191924), they do not damp away completely. Due to toroidal momentum conservation, a finite **Rosenbluth-Hinton residual flow** persists. The magnitude of this residual, and thus the effectiveness of stationary shear suppression, is determined by global geometric parameters, scaling approximately as $(1 + 1.6 q^2/\sqrt{\epsilon})^{-1}$, where $\epsilon=a/R$ is the inverse aspect ratio. Thus, the regulatory capacity of ZFs is intrinsically linked to the global machine geometry and magnetic configuration ($q(r)$) .

- **Geodesic Acoustic Modes (GAMs):** These are finite-frequency, axisymmetric oscillations, with a frequency set by the geometry, $\omega_{\mathrm{GAM}} \sim c_s/R$, where $c_s$ is the sound speed. They represent an oscillatory exchange between flow energy and pressure perturbations, mediated by the [geodesic curvature](@entry_id:158028) of the magnetic field lines. GAMs provide an oscillatory shearing that also helps regulate turbulence. However, they are subject to damping, primarily collisionless Landau damping. Furthermore, because their local frequency depends on $q(r)$, a global GAM structure that spans a region of varying $q$ will rapidly de-phase and damp due to **[phase mixing](@entry_id:199798)**. In regions of strong magnetic shear, this phase-mixing damping is very effective, potentially shifting the burden of turbulence regulation from oscillatory GAMs to the residual ZFs . The coupling to GAMs can also act as an energy sink for ZFs, which can reduce the nonlinear upshift in the critical gradient for transport onset (the "Dimits shift") compared to local models that may neglect this coupling .

#### Turbulence Spreading as Nonlocal Transport

Perhaps the most dramatic consequence of global dynamics is **turbulence spreading**. This is the nonlocal radial propagation of turbulent fluctuation intensity from a region where it is linearly unstable into an adjacent region where it is linearly stable. This phenomenon cannot be described by local models, which by construction have no concept of distinct stable and unstable zones .

Turbulence spreading is fundamentally different from diffusive transport. A diffusive process is gradient-driven, with a flux proportional to $-\nabla I$, where $I$ is the intensity. This leads to a characteristic propagation of a front that scales with the square root of time, $r_f(t) \propto \sqrt{t}$. In contrast, turbulence spreading is an advective, or convective, process. It is mediated by two primary mechanisms :
1.  **Linear Group Velocity:** Wave packets of drift-[wave turbulence](@entry_id:1133992) have a finite radial group velocity, $v_g = \partial\omega_r/\partial k_r$, which allows them to carry energy radially.
2.  **Nonlinear Convection:** The nonlinear interaction between different turbulent eddies can generate a collective, directed flux of turbulence energy.

These advective fluxes are proportional to the intensity itself, not its gradient. They lead to a front that propagates **ballistically**, with a distance proportional to time, $r_f(t) \propto t$. Because of this convective propagation, turbulence can "invade" a linearly stable region, establishing a finite level of fluctuation and transport where local theories would predict none. This fundamentally nonlocal behavior, where transport at a given radius depends on the plasma conditions at other radii, is a critical element in building predictive models of confinement in fusion devices.
