            "problem": "Consider alpha particle channeling using Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) in a tokamak of large aspect ratio. An alpha particle (helium nucleus) has charge $q_{\\alpha} = 2e$ and mass $m_{\\alpha}$. In a tokamak with circular concentric flux surfaces, the toroidal magnetic field magnitude scales approximately as $B(R) = B_{0}\\,\\frac{R_{0}}{R}$, where $R$ is the major radius, $B_{0}$ is the magnetic field at the magnetic axis located at $R_{0}$. A radio-frequency (RF) wave of angular frequency $\\omega$ and parallel wavenumber $k_{\\parallel}$ interacts with gyro-motion harmonics indexed by the integer $n$.\n\nStarting from first principles of phase synchronism between a charged particle’s gyro-motion and an applied RF wave, and using the definition of cyclotron frequency, derive the resonance condition appropriate for ICRH of alpha particles at harmonic $n$.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of plasma physics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe first step is to derive the resonance condition for an alpha particle interacting with a radio-frequency (RF) wave in a magnetic field. A charged particle undergoes resonant interaction with an electromagnetic wave when the wave frequency in the particle's reference frame matches a harmonic of the particle's natural frequency of gyration.\n\nThe natural angular frequency of gyration for a charged particle, known as the cyclotron frequency, is given by\n$$\n\\Omega = \\frac{|q|B}{m}\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the particle's charge, $m$ is its mass, and $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field. For an alpha particle, the charge is $q_{\\alpha} = 2e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, and the mass is $m_{\\alpha}$. Thus, the alpha particle cyclotron frequency is\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\alpha} = \\frac{2eB}{m_{\\alpha}}\n$$\nAn RF wave is characterized by an angular frequency $\\omega$ and a wave-vector $\\vec{k}$. The component of the wave-vector parallel to the magnetic field is $k_{\\parallel}$. A particle moving with a velocity component $v_{\\parallel}$ parallel to the magnetic field perceives the wave frequency as being Doppler-shifted. The frequency perceived by the particle is $\\omega' = \\omega - k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel}$.\n\nResonant energy exchange occurs when this perceived frequency matches an integer multiple, or harmonic, of the cyclotron frequency. This is because the particle's helical motion and the wave's oscillating fields must maintain a consistent phase relationship for a net transfer of energy to occur over many gyro-periods. The general resonance condition is therefore\n$$\n\\omega - k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} = n\\Omega_{\\alpha}\n$$\nwhere $n$ is an integer known as the harmonic number.\n\nThe problem statement provides a crucial simplification: we are to neglect the Doppler shift by assuming the parallel wavenumber is negligible, i.e., $k_{\\parallel} \\approx 0$. This is a common assumption for perpendicular heating scenarios where the wave is launched with its wave-vector nearly perpendicular to the main magnetic field. Under this assumption, the resonance condition simplifies to\n$$\n\\omega = n\\Omega_{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis is the derived resonance condition appropriate for ICRH of alpha particles under the given simplification.\n\nThe second part of the task is to calculate the major radius $R$ at which this resonance occurs for the fundamental harmonic, $n=1$. The condition becomes\n$$\n\\omega = \\Omega_{\\alpha}(R)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Omega_{\\alpha}$, we get\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{2eB(R)}{m_{\\alpha}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the spatial dependence of the toroidal magnetic field in a large aspect-ratio tokamak as\n$$\nB(R) = B_{0}\\frac{R_{0}}{R}\n$$\nwhere $B_{0}$ is the magnetic field at the major radius of the magnetic axis, $R_{0}$. Substituting this expression for $B(R)$ into our resonance condition yields\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{2e}{m_{\\alpha}} \\left( B_{0}\\frac{R_{0}}{R} \\right)\n$$\nWe must now solve this equation for the major radius $R$. Rearranging the terms, we find\n$$\nR = \\frac{2eB_{0}R_{0}}{m_{\\alpha}\\omega}\n$$\nThe problem provides the RF frequency $f$ and the relation $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. Substituting this into the expression for $R$ gives\n$$\nR = \\frac{2eB_{0}R_{0}}{m_{\\alpha}(2\\pi f)} = \\frac{eB_{0}R_{0}}{m_{\\alpha}\\pi f}\n$$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the resonant major radius.

Let $\\Delta t$ be the time required for the particle to reach this boundary. At $t=\\Delta t$, we have $P_{\\phi}(\\Delta t) = q \\psi_{a}$.\n$$ q \\psi_{a} = P_{\\phi 0} + S \\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}} \\Delta t $$\nWe can solve this equation for the time-to-loss, $\\Delta t$:\n$$ S \\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}} \\Delta t = q \\psi_{a} - P_{\\phi 0} $$\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{q \\psi_{a} - P_{\\phi 0}}{S \\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}}} $$\n\nThe problem requires that this loss occurs before the particle is collisionally slowed down. The characteristic time for slowing down is given as $\\tau_{s}(E_{0})$. The condition for \"fast loss\" is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta t  \\tau_{s}(E_{0}) $$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\Delta t$:\n$$ \\frac{q \\psi_{a} - P_{\\phi 0}}{S \\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}}}  \\tau_{s}(E_{0}) $$\n\nWe must now solve this inequality for the slope $S$ to find the minimum value, $S_{\\min}$, that guarantees this condition is met. Let us analyze the signs of the terms involved:\n1.  The initial state is inside the plasma, so $P_{\\phi 0}  q \\psi_{a}$. This implies that the numerator $q \\psi_{a} - P_{\\phi 0}$ is negative.\n2.  The wave removes energy from the particle, so $\\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}}  0$.\n3.  The particle loses both energy ($E  E_{0}$) and canonical momentum ($P_{\\phi}  P_{\\phi 0}$) to reach the loss boundary. Since $S = \\mathrm{d}P_{\\phi}/\\mathrm{d}E$, and both differentials are negative, the slope $S$ must be positive.\n4.  The slowing-down time $\\tau_{s}(E_{0})$ is a physical time scale and is positive.\n\nThe term $S \\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}}$ in the denominator is a product of a positive term ($S$) and a negative term ($\\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}}$), so it is negative. The overall fraction on the left side of the inequality is a negative number divided by a negative number, which is positive, as expected for a time duration.\n\nTo solve for $S$, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $S \\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}}$. Since this term is negative, we must reverse the inequality sign:\n$$ q \\psi_{a} - P_{\\phi 0}  S \\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}} \\tau_{s}(E_{0}) $$\nTo isolate $S$, we now divide by $\\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}} \\tau_{s}(E_{0})$. Since $\\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}}  0$ and $\\tau_{s}(E_{0})  0$, this product is negative. Therefore, we must reverse the inequality sign again:\n$$ \\frac{q \\psi_{a} - P_{\\phi 0}}{\\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}} \\tau_{s}(E_{0})}  S $$\nThis inequality can be written as:\n$$ S  \\frac{q \\psi_{a} - P_{\\phi 0}}{\\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}} \\tau_{s}(E_{0})} $$\nTo make the expression more clear, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $-1$:\n$$ S  \\frac{P_{\\phi 0} - q \\psi_{a}}{-\\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}} \\tau_{s}(E_{0})} $$\nThe condition for fast loss is that the slope $S$ must be greater than the expression on the right. The minimum slope $S_{\\min}$ that guarantees this condition is the threshold value itself, i.e., the infimum of the set of allowed slopes.\n$$ S_{\\min} = \\frac{P_{\\phi 0} - q \\psi_{a}}{-\\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}} \\tau_{s}(E_{0})} $$\nThe units of this expression are $[P_{\\phi}] / ( [E]/[T] \\cdot [T] ) = [P_{\\phi}] / [E]$, which correctly corresponds to units of time (e.g., Joule-seconds / Joules = seconds), as requested.\nThe final expression for $S_{\\min}$ is in terms of the given parameters $(E_{0},P_{\\phi 0},q \\psi_{a},\\dot{E}_{\\text{wave}},\\tau_{s}(E_{0}))$, where $E_0$ is implicitly included in the function $\\tau_s(E_0)$.",
