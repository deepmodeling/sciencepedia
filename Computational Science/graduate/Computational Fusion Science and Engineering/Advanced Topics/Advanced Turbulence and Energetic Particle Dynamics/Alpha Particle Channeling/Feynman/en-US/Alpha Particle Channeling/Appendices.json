            "solution": "The first step is to derive the resonance condition for an alpha particle interacting with a radio-frequency (RF) wave in a magnetic field. A charged particle undergoes resonant interaction with an electromagnetic wave when the wave frequency in the particle's reference frame matches a harmonic of the particle's natural frequency of gyration.\n\nThe natural angular frequency of gyration for a charged particle, known as the cyclotron frequency, is given by\n$$\n\\Omega = \\frac{|q|B}{m}\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the particle's charge, $m$ is its mass, and $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field. For an alpha particle, the charge is $q_{\\alpha} = 2e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, and the mass is $m_{\\alpha}$. Thus, the alpha particle cyclotron frequency is\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\alpha} = \\frac{2eB}{m_{\\alpha}}\n$$\nAn RF wave is characterized by an angular frequency $\\omega$ and a wave-vector $\\vec{k}$. The component of the wave-vector parallel to the magnetic field is $k_{\\parallel}$. A particle moving with a velocity component $v_{\\parallel}$ parallel to the magnetic field perceives the wave frequency as being Doppler-shifted. The frequency perceived by the particle is $\\omega' = \\omega - k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel}$.\n\nResonant energy exchange occurs when this perceived frequency matches an integer multiple, or harmonic, of the cyclotron frequency. This is because the particle's helical motion and the wave's oscillating fields must maintain a consistent phase relationship for a net transfer of energy to occur over many gyro-periods. The general resonance condition is therefore\n$$\n\\omega - k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} = n\\Omega_{\\alpha}\n$$\nwhere $n$ is an integer known as the harmonic number.\n\nThe problem statement provides a crucial simplification: we are to neglect the Doppler shift by assuming the parallel wavenumber is negligible, i.e., $k_{\\parallel} \\approx 0$. This is a common assumption for perpendicular heating scenarios where the wave is launched with its wave-vector nearly perpendicular to the main magnetic field. Under this assumption, the resonance condition simplifies to\n$$\n\\omega = n\\Omega_{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis is the derived resonance condition appropriate for ICRH of alpha particles under the given simplification.\n\nThe second part of the task is to calculate the major radius $R$ at which this resonance occurs for the fundamental harmonic, $n=1$. The condition becomes\n$$\n\\omega = \\Omega_{\\alpha}(R)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Omega_{\\alpha}$, we get\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{2eB(R)}{m_{\\alpha}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the spatial dependence of the toroidal magnetic field in a large aspect-ratio tokamak as\n$$\nB(R) = B_{0}\\frac{R_{0}}{R}\n$$\nwhere $B_{0}$ is the magnetic field at the major radius of the magnetic axis, $R_{0}$. Substituting this expression for $B(R)$ into our resonance condition yields\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{2e}{m_{\\alpha}} \\left( B_{0}\\frac{R_{0}}{R} \\right)\n$$\nWe must now solve this equation for the major radius $R$. Rearranging the terms, we find\n$$\nR = \\frac{2eB_{0}R_{0}}{m_{\\alpha}\\omega}\n$$\nThe problem provides the RF frequency $f$ and the relation $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. Substituting this into the expression for $R$ gives\n$$\nR = \\frac{2eB_{0}R_{0}}{m_{\\alpha}(2\\pi f)} = \\frac{eB_{0}R_{0}}{m_{\\alpha}\\pi f}\n$$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the resonant major radius.

            "solution": "The problem is addressed in three parts as requested: derivation of the loss boundary $P_{\\phi,\\mathrm{lc}}$, derivation of the loss cone half-angle $\\alpha_c$, and numerical evaluation of $\\alpha_c$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Loss Boundary $P_{\\phi,\\mathrm{lc}}(\\mathcal{E},\\mu)$**\n\nThe canonical toroidal angular momentum, $P_\\phi$, is a constant of motion for a charged particle in an axisymmetric magnetic field. It is defined as:\n$$P_\\phi = m R v_\\phi + q A_\\phi$$\nwhere $m$ and $q$ are the particle's mass and charge, $R$ is the major radial coordinate, $v_\\phi$ is the toroidal component of the particle's velocity, and $A_\\phi$ is the toroidal component of the magnetic vector potential, which is given as the poloidal flux $\\psi$.\n\nA \"marginally lost\" orbit is one that grazes the physical boundary of the plasma, which in this case is the limiter at the outboard midplane. At this point, the particle's coordinates are $(R, Z) = (R_a, 0)$, where $R_a = R_0 + a$. The poloidal flux and magnetic field strength at this location are $\\psi_a$ and $B_a$, respectively.\n\nThe value of $P_\\phi$ for this marginal orbit defines the loss boundary, $P_{\\phi,\\mathrm{lc}}$. At the point of contact with the limiter:\n$$P_{\\phi,\\mathrm{lc}} = m R_a v_{\\phi,a} + q \\psi_a$$\nwhere $v_{\\phi,a}$ is the toroidal velocity at $R=R_a$. We need to express $v_{\\phi,a}$ in terms of the invariants $\\mathcal{E}$ and $\\mu$, and the local magnetic field $B_a$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is $\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{1}{2}m v^2$. The particle velocity can be decomposed into components parallel ($v_\\parallel$) and perpendicular ($v_\\perp$) to the magnetic field line, such that $v^2 = v_\\parallel^2 + v_\\perp^2$.\nThe magnetic moment is $\\mu = \\frac{m v_\\perp^2}{2 B}$.\nFrom these definitions, we can write the parallel kinetic energy as:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} m v_\\parallel^2 = \\mathcal{E} - \\frac{1}{2}m v_\\perp^2 = \\mathcal{E} - \\mu B$$\nThis gives the parallel velocity at any point with magnetic field strength $B$:\n$$v_\\parallel = \\sigma_\\parallel \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}(\\mathcal{E} - \\mu B)}$$\nwhere $\\sigma_\\parallel = \\pm 1$ denotes the direction of motion along the field line.\n\nThe problem states that the tokamak is of large-aspect-ratio and the total magnetic field is dominated by the toroidal component. This implies that the magnetic field lines are almost purely toroidal, so $\\vec{B} \\approx B_\\phi \\hat{\\phi}$. Consequently, the velocity component parallel to the magnetic field is approximately equal to the toroidal velocity component, $v_\\parallel \\approx v_\\phi$.\n\nAt the limiter radius $R_a$, the magnetic field is $B_a$. The toroidal velocity is thus:\n$$v_{\\phi,a} \\approx v_{\\parallel,a} = \\sigma_v \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}(\\mathcal{E} - \\mu B_a)}$$\nwhere $\\sigma_v = \\mathrm{sgn}(v_\\phi)$ determines if the particle is co-passing ($\\sigma_v = +1$) or counter-passing ($\\sigma_v = -1$). Substituting this into the expression for $P_{\\phi,\\mathrm{lc}}$:\n$$P_{\\phi,\\mathrm{lc}}(\\mathcal{E}, \\mu) = m R_a \\left(\\sigma_v \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}(\\mathcal{E} - \\mu B_a)}\\right) + q \\psi_a$$\n$$P_{\\phi,\\mathrm{lc}}(\\mathcal{E}, \\mu) = \\sigma_v R_a \\sqrt{2m(\\mathcal{E} - \\mu B_a)} + q \\psi_a$$\nThis expression defines the loss boundary in $(\\mathcal{E}, P_\\phi)$ space for a given $\\mu$. There are two such boundaries, corresponding to the two possible signs of $\\sigma_v$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Loss Cone Half-Angle $\\alpha_c$**\n\nThe pitch angle $\\alpha$ at any point is defined by the relation between the perpendicular and total velocity: $v_\\perp = v \\sin(\\alpha)$. We can express the magnetic moment $\\mu$ in terms of the pitch angle:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{m v_\\perp^2}{2 B} = \\frac{m (v \\sin\\alpha)^2}{2 B} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\right) \\frac{\\sin^2\\alpha}{B} = \\mathcal{E} \\frac{\\sin^2\\alpha}{B}$$\nThis gives a direct relationship between the pitch angle at a location with field $B$ and the invariants $\\mathcal{E}$ and $\\mu$:\n$$\\sin^2\\alpha = \\frac{\\mu B}{\\mathcal{E}}$$\nA particle mirrors at a point where its parallel velocity $v_\\parallel$ becomes zero. From the energy conservation relation $\\mathcal{E}_\\parallel = \\mathcal{E} - \\mu B$, this occurs at a magnetic field strength $B_m$ such that $\\mathcal{E} = \\mu B_m$.\n\nThe problem defines the loss cone as the set of pitch angles for passing particles. The boundary of this cone corresponds to particles that are marginally trapped—they mirror exactly at the point of highest magnetic field on their path. For a particle traversing between the outboard and inboard midplanes, the maximum field occurs at the inboard midplane, $R = R_0 - a$, with magnitude $B_{\\max}$.\nSo, for a marginally passing particle, the mirror condition is:\n$$\\mathcal{E} = \\mu B_{\\max}$$\nWe want to find the critical pitch angle, $\\alpha_c$, at the outboard midplane, where $R=R_a$ and $B=B_a$. Using the general relation for the pitch angle at this location:\n$$\\sin^2\\alpha_c = \\frac{\\mu B_a}{\\mathcal{E}}$$\nSubstituting the marginal condition $\\mu = \\mathcal{E} / B_{\\max}$ into this equation:\n$$\\sin^2\\alpha_c = \\frac{(\\mathcal{E}/B_{\\max}) B_a}{\\mathcal{E}} = \\frac{B_a}{B_{\\max}}$$\nThe half-angle $\\alpha_c$ is therefore:\n$$\\alpha_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{B_a}{B_{\\max}}}\\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given expressions for $B_a$ and $B_{\\max}$:\n$$B_a = \\frac{B_0 R_0}{R_0 + a}$$\n$$B_{\\max} = \\frac{B_0 R_0}{R_0 - a}$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\frac{B_a}{B_{\\max}} = \\frac{B_0 R_0 / (R_0 + a)}{B_0 R_0 / (R_0 - a)} = \\frac{R_0 - a}{R_0 + a}$$\nThus, the closed-form expression for the loss cone half-angle is:\n$$\\alpha_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{R_0 - a}{R_0 + a}}\\right)$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation of $\\alpha_c$**\n\nWe are given the values $R_0 = 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $a = 1.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}$. Substituting these into the expression for $\\alpha_c$:\n$$\\frac{R_0 - a}{R_0 + a} = \\frac{3.0 - 1.0}{3.0 + 1.0} = \\frac{2.0}{4.0} = 0.5$$\nTherefore,\n$$\\alpha_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{0.5}\\right) = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$$\nThis corresponds to the well-known angle:\n$$\\alpha_c = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\ \\mathrm{radians}$$\nTo provide a numerical answer rounded to four significant figures, we evaluate this expression:\n$$\\alpha_c \\approx 0.78539816... \\ \\mathrm{radians}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\alpha_c \\approx 0.7854 \\ \\mathrm{radians}$$",

Since $\\dot{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\text{wave}}  0$ and $\\tau_{s}(\\mathcal{E}_{0})  0$, this product is negative. Therefore, we must reverse the inequality sign again:\n$$ \\frac{q \\psi_{a} - P_{\\phi 0}}{\\dot{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\text{wave}} \\tau_{s}(\\mathcal{E}_{0})}  S $$\nThis inequality can be written as:\n$$ S  \\frac{q \\psi_{a} - P_{\\phi 0}}{\\dot{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\text{wave}} \\tau_{s}(\\mathcal{E}_{0})} $$\nTo make the expression more clear, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $-1$:\n$$ S  \\frac{P_{\\phi 0} - q \\psi_{a}}{-\\dot{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\text{wave}} \\tau_{s}(\\mathcal{E}_{0})} $$\nThe condition for fast loss is that the slope $S$ must be greater than the expression on the right. The minimum slope $S_{\\min}$ that guarantees this condition is the threshold value itself, i.e., the infimum of the set of allowed slopes.\n$$ S_{\\min} = \\frac{P_{\\phi 0} - q \\psi_{a}}{-\\dot{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\text{wave}} \\tau_{s}(\\mathcal{E}_{0})} $$\nThe units of this expression are $[P_{\\phi}] / ( [\\mathcal{E}]/[T] \\cdot [T] ) = [P_{\\phi}] / [\\mathcal{E}]$, which correctly corresponds to units of time (e.g., Joule-seconds / Joules = seconds), as requested.\nThe final expression for $S_{\\min}$ is in terms of the given parameters $(\\mathcal{E}_{0}, P_{\\phi 0}, q \\psi_a, \\dot{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\text{wave}}, \\tau_s(\\mathcal{E}_0))$, where $\\mathcal{E}_0$ is implicitly included in the function $\\tau_s(\\mathcal{E}_0)$.",
