            "introduction": "The flow of energy in plasma turbulence is not a simple one-way cascade from large to small scales. A crucial aspect of multi-scale dynamics is the process of \"backscatter,\" where energy from small-scale fluctuations, such as those driven by electron temperature gradients (ETG), can be transferred back to re-energize larger, ion-scale modes. This exercise provides a window into the fundamental mechanism of this process by modeling it as a parametric instability within a resonant three-wave triad . By performing a stability analysis on a simplified set of envelope equations, you will derive the critical condition under which this upward energy transfer overcomes the natural damping of the large-scale modes.",

The EGK energy-conserving structure implies that, in the absence of linear terms, the three-wave system redistributes energy among the triad without net creation.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the slow-time envelope equations governing the ion-scale daughters in the presence of the electron-scale pump can be written as a pair of linear, time-invariant equations for small $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d a_{1}}{d t}=-\\gamma_{1} a_{1}+\\mathcal{C}\\,a_{2}^{*}\\,a_{3},\\qquad\n\\frac{d a_{2}^{*}}{d t}=-\\gamma_{2} a_{2}^{*}+\\mathcal{C}^{*}\\,a_{1}\\,a_{3}^{*},\n$$\nwhere the superscript ${}^{*}$ denotes complex conjugation.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe provided system of equations describes the evolution of the complex amplitudes $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}^{*}$. This is a linear, time-invariant system which can be expressed in matrix form. Let the state vector be $\\boldsymbol{x}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{1}(t) \\\\ a_{2}^{*}(t) \\end{pmatrix}$. The system can then be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{x}}{dt} = \\mathbf{M} \\boldsymbol{x}\n$$\nwhere the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\gamma_{1} & \\mathcal{C} a_{3} \\\\ \\mathcal{C}^{*} a_{3}^{*} & -\\gamma_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe stability of this system is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$. Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue. The solutions to the system are of the form $\\boldsymbol{x}(t) = \\boldsymbol{x}_{0} \\exp(\\lambda t)$. The system is stable if the real parts of all eigenvalues are negative, marginally stable if the largest real part is zero, and unstable if at least one eigenvalue has a positive real part. The problem asks for the condition under which the system becomes unstable, which corresponds to finding the threshold where the largest real part of the eigenvalues becomes positive.\n\nThe eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{M} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\gamma_{1} - \\lambda & \\mathcal{C} a_{3} \\\\ \\mathcal{C}^{*} a_{3}^{*} & -\\gamma_{2} - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant gives the characteristic polynomial:\n$$\n(-\\gamma_{1} - \\lambda)(-\\gamma_{2} - \\lambda) - (\\mathcal{C} a_{3})(\\mathcal{C}^{*} a_{3}^{*}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\lambda + \\gamma_{1})(\\lambda + \\gamma_{2}) - |\\mathcal{C}|^{2} |a_{3}|^{2} = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the eigenvalue $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda^{2} + (\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2})\\lambda + (\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} - |\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2}) = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this equation are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{-(\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2}) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2})^{2} - 4(\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} - |\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2})}}{2}\n$$\nLet's simplify the term under the square root (the discriminant):\n$$\n(\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2})^{2} - 4\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2} = \\gamma_{1}^{2} + 2\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} + \\gamma_{2}^{2} - 4\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2}\n$$\n$$\n= \\gamma_{1}^{2} - 2\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} + \\gamma_{2}^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2} = (\\gamma_{1} - \\gamma_{2})^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2}\n$$\nSince $\\gamma_{1}$ and $\\gamma_{2}$ are real, and $|\\mathcal{C}|$ and $|a_{3}|$ represent magnitudes, the discriminant is always non-negative. Therefore, the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are always real.\nThe two eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = -\\frac{\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2}}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\gamma_{1} - \\gamma_{2})^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2}}}{2}\n$$\nThe system becomes unstable when the larger eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{+}$, becomes positive. The threshold for instability is the point at which $\\lambda_{+} = 0$.\n$$\n\\lambda_{+} = -\\frac{\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\gamma_{1} - \\gamma_{2})^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2}}}{2} = 0\n$$\nTo solve for the critical pump amplitude $|a_{3}|$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\n\\sqrt{(\\gamma_{1} - \\gamma_{2})^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2}} = \\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2}\n$$\nSquaring both sides of the equation yields:\n$$\n(\\gamma_{1} - \\gamma_{2})^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2} = (\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2})^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{1}^{2} - 2\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} + \\gamma_{2}^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2} = \\gamma_{1}^{2} + 2\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} + \\gamma_{2}^{2}\n$$\nCanceling common terms from both sides gives:\n$$\n4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2} = 4\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}\n$$\nSolving for $|a_{3}|^{2}$:\n$$\n|a_{3}|^{2} = \\frac{\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}}{|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}}\n$$\nThe minimum pump amplitude $|a_{3}|$ required for instability is therefore the square root of this expression. We take the positive root as amplitude is a non-negative quantity.\n$$\n|a_{3}| = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}}{|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}}}{|\\mathcal{C}|}\n$$\nThis expression represents the critical value of the pump amplitude. For any $|a_{3}|$ greater than this value, the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{+}$ will be positive, leading to exponential growth of the ion-scale modes. If $|\\mathcal{C}| = 0$, the threshold becomes infinite, meaning instability is impossible, which is physically correct as there is no coupling.",

The functional forms for the growth rate and saturation spectrum are plausible simplified models. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary functions and parameters for a unique solution. The language is objective and unambiguous. The narrowband assumption $\\sigma \\ll \\sigma_{\\gamma}$ is a standard and well-defined approximation technique used in theoretical physics to simplify integrals where one function in the integrand is much more sharply peaked than others. All criteria for a valid problem are met.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem first asks to justify the integral form for the quasilinear heat flux, $Q_{\\mathrm{QL}}$. The ion heat flux is driven by the correlation between the radial component of the $\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}$ drift velocity fluctuations, $\\tilde{v}_{E,r}$, and the ion pressure fluctuations, $\\tilde{p}_i$. In a spectral description, this leads to a transport level proportional to the sum over modes of the product of the linear growth rate $\\gamma(\\kappa)$ and the saturated mode intensity. The problem encapsulates the mode intensity and other spectral factors in the saturation-weight function $S(\\kappa)$. Thus, the spectral density of the flux is proportional to $\\gamma(\\kappa)S(\\kappa)$, and the total flux is the integral over all contributing wavenumbers:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{QL}} = C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\gamma(\\kappa)\\,S(\\kappa)\\,d\\kappa\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we use the narrowband assumption $\\sigma \\ll \\sigma_{\\gamma}$. The function $S(\\kappa)$ is a narrow Gaussian centered at $\\kappa_p = 0.40$ with a width $\\sigma = 0.05$, while $\\gamma(\\kappa)$ is a much broader Gaussian centered at the same $\\kappa_p$ with a width $\\sigma_\\gamma = 0.20$. Because the integrand is dominated by the narrow peak of $S(\\kappa)$, we can approximate the slowly varying function $\\gamma(\\kappa)$ by its value at the peak, $\\gamma(\\kappa_p) = \\gamma_p$.\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{QL}} \\approx C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\gamma(\\kappa_{p})\\,S(\\kappa)\\,d\\kappa = C\\,\\gamma_{p} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} S_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left[-\\frac{(\\kappa - \\kappa_{p})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right]d\\kappa\n$$\nThe integral is over a Gaussian function. Since the peak at $\\kappa_p = 0.40$ is many standard deviations ($\\sigma = 0.05$) away from the lower integration limit of $0$, we can extend the integration range to $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ with negligible error.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\!\\left[-\\frac{(\\kappa - \\kappa_{p})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right]d\\kappa \\approx \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\!\\left[-\\frac{(\\kappa - \\kappa_{p})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right]d\\kappa = \\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2} = \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}\n$$\nTherefore, the quasilinear heat flux is\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{QL}} \\approx C\\,\\gamma_{p}\\,S_{0}\\,\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the multiscale-suppressed heat flux, $Q_{\\mathrm{MS}}$. The problem states that an additional decorrelation rate $\\omega_E$ from mesoscopic flows modifies the dynamics. The suppression effect on the flux can be modeled by multiplying the original flux spectrum by a factor representing the reduction in transport efficiency. A physically motivated choice for this factor is the ratio of the modified correlation time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{MS}} \\sim [\\gamma(\\kappa) + \\omega_E]^{-1}$ to the original quasilinear correlation time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{QL}} \\sim [\\gamma(\\kappa)]^{-1}$. This suppression factor is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{MS}}/\\tau_{\\mathrm{QL}} = \\gamma(\\kappa)/[\\gamma(\\kappa) + \\omega_E]$. Applying this to the original flux spectrum $\\gamma(\\kappa)S(\\kappa)$ gives the integrand for $Q_{\\mathrm{MS}}$, consistent with the problem statement:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{MS}} = C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\gamma(\\kappa)}{\\gamma(\\kappa) + \\omega_{E}}\\,\\gamma(\\kappa)\\,S(\\kappa)\\,d\\kappa\n$$\nWe evaluate this integral using the same narrowband approximation. The functions $\\gamma(\\kappa)$ and the suppression factor $\\frac{\\gamma(\\kappa)}{\\gamma(\\kappa) + \\omega_{E}}$ are slowly varying compared to the narrow peak of $S(\\kappa)$. We can therefore evaluate these slowly varying terms at the peak wavenumber $\\kappa_p$:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{MS}} \\approx C \\left( \\frac{\\gamma(\\kappa_p)}{\\gamma(\\kappa_p) + \\omega_{E}} \\right) \\gamma(\\kappa_p) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} S(\\kappa)\\,d\\kappa\n$$\nSubstituting $\\gamma(\\kappa_p) = \\gamma_p$ and the previously calculated integral of $S(\\kappa)$:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{MS}} \\approx C \\left( \\frac{\\gamma_p}{\\gamma_p + \\omega_{E}} \\right) \\gamma_p (S_0\\,\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}) = C \\frac{\\gamma_p^2}{\\gamma_p + \\omega_E} S_0 \\, \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R \\equiv Q_{\\mathrm{MS}}/Q_{\\mathrm{QL}}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{MS}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{QL}}} \\approx \\frac{C \\frac{\\gamma_p^2}{\\gamma_p + \\omega_E} S_0 \\, \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{C\\,\\gamma_{p}\\,S_{0}\\,\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\n$$\nThe constant $C$ and the terms $S_0$, $\\sigma$, and $\\sqrt{2\\pi}$ cancel out, leaving a simple expression for the suppression ratio:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\gamma_p}{\\gamma_p + \\omega_E}\n$$\nThis result shows that, under the narrowband approximation, the overall suppression of the integrated heat flux is determined entirely by the suppression factor evaluated at the spectral peak.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided: $\\gamma_p = 0.12$ and $\\omega_E = 0.08$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.08} = \\frac{0.12}{0.20} = \\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a dimensionless decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n\n$R = 0.6000$.",

The physics described is a standard, albeit simplified, quasilinear model for turbulent transport in magnetically confined plasmas. The concepts of Fick's law for diffusive flux, mixing-length estimates for diffusivities ($\\chi \\propto \\gamma/k^2$), and shear suppression of turbulence are canonical elements of plasma transport theory. The specific model for multi-scale interaction (additive suppression and additive diffusivity) is a recognized hypothesis in the research literature. All necessary parameters are provided with physically plausible values and consistent units. The problem is self-contained, objective, and does not violate any fundamental principles. A unique solution is attainable through direct calculation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the magnitude of the outward electron heat flux, $|Q_{e}|$, at the specified radial location. The electron heat flux is given by the diffusive closure relationship:\n$$\nQ_{e} = - n_{e} \\chi_{e} \\frac{\\partial T_{e}}{\\partial r}\n$$\nThe total electron thermal diffusivity, $\\chi_{e}$, is given by the multi-scale interaction model:\n$$\n\\chi_{e} = S_{m}\\,\\chi_{e,0} + \\delta \\chi_{\\mathrm{add}}\n$$\nWe will first derive the expression for $\\chi_{e}$ by calculating its constituent components.\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline electron-scale diffusivity, $\\chi_{e,0}$, using the quasilinear mixing-length formula:\n$$\n\\chi_{e,0} = C_{e} \\frac{\\gamma_{e}}{k_{e}^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, $C_{e} = 1.2$, $\\gamma_{e} = 8.0 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $k_{e} = 1.5 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\chi_{e,0} = 1.2 \\times \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(1.5 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1})^{2}} = 1.2 \\times \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{5}}{2.25 \\times 10^{6}} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s} = 0.4266... \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nFor precision, we can express this as a fraction: $\\chi_{e,0} = \\frac{32}{75} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the multiplicative suppression factor, $S_{m}$, which arises from the shortening of the eddy correlation time by the ion-scale $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ shear:\n$$\nS_{m} = \\frac{\\gamma_{e}}{\\gamma_{e} + \\gamma_{E}}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\gamma_{e} = 8.0 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\\gamma_{E} = 4.0 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$:\n$$\nS_{m} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{8.0 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 4.0 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{5}}{12.0 \\times 10^{5}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\n$S_{m}$ is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nThen, we calculate the additive diffusivity, $\\delta \\chi_{\\mathrm{add}}$, which represents cross-scale scattering by ion-scale motions:\n$$\n\\delta \\chi_{\\mathrm{add}} = C_{i} \\frac{\\gamma_{E}}{k_{i}^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_{i} = 0.080$, $\\gamma_{E} = 4.0 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $k_{i} = 2.0 \\times 10^{2} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\delta \\chi_{\\mathrm{add}} = 0.080 \\times \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(2.0 \\times 10^{2} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1})^{2}} = 0.080 \\times \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{5}}{4.0 \\times 10^{4}} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s} = 0.080 \\times 10 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s} = 0.8 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\nNow, we can assemble the total electron thermal diffusivity, $\\chi_{e}$:\n$$\n\\chi_{e} = S_{m}\\,\\chi_{e,0} + \\delta \\chi_{\\mathrm{add}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{32}{75} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}\\right) + 0.8 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\chi_{e} = \\frac{64}{225} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s} + \\frac{4}{5} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s} = \\left(\\frac{64}{225} + \\frac{180}{225}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s} = \\frac{244}{225} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s} \\approx 1.0844 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\nThe next step is to prepare the other terms for the heat flux calculation. The electron temperature gradient is given in units of $\\mathrm{keV}/\\mathrm{m}$. It must be converted to SI units of $\\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T_{e}}{\\partial r} = -4.0 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{keV}}{\\mathrm{m}} = -4.0 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{eV}}{\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\nUsing the conversion factor $1 \\, \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{J}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T_{e}}{\\partial r} = -4.0 \\times 10^{3} \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{m}} = -6.408 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\n\nWe now have all the necessary components to calculate the electron heat flux, $Q_{e}$. The term $|Q_{e}|$ represents the magnitude. Since the electron density $n_{e}$ and diffusivity $\\chi_{e}$ are positive, and the temperature gradient $\\partial T_{e}/\\partial r$ is negative, the product $-n_{e} \\chi_{e} (\\partial T_{e}/\\partial r)$ is positive, correctly representing a net outward heat flux (down the gradient). Therefore, $|Q_{e}| = Q_{e}$.\n$$\n|Q_{e}| = - n_{e} \\chi_{e} \\frac{\\partial T_{e}}{\\partial r}\n$$\nSubstituting the values $n_{e} = 7.0 \\times 10^{19} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $\\chi_{e} = \\frac{244}{225} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$, and $\\frac{\\partial T_{e}}{\\partial r} = -6.408 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$\n|Q_{e}| = - (7.0 \\times 10^{19} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\times \\left(\\frac{244}{225} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}}\\right) \\times \\left(-6.408 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{m}}\\right)\n$$\nThe units are $(\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}) = \\mathrm{J}/(\\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{2}) = \\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, as expected.\n$$\n|Q_{e}| = (7.0 \\times 10^{19}) \\times \\left(\\frac{244}{225}\\right) \\times (6.408 \\times 10^{-16}) \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{W}}{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n|Q_{e}| = 7.0 \\times \\frac{244}{225} \\times 6.408 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{W}}{\\mathrm{m}^{2}} \\approx 48643.56 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{W}}{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in megawatts per square meter ($\\mathrm{MW}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$), where $1 \\, \\mathrm{MW} = 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{W}$.\n$$\n|Q_{e}| \\approx 48643.56 \\, \\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{m}^{2} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\mathrm{MW}}{10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{W}} \\approx 0.04864356 \\, \\mathrm{MW}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $0.0486 \\, \\mathrm{MW}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. In standard scientific notation, this is $4.86 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{MW}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.",
