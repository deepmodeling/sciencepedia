            "introduction": "A critical aspect of multi-scale dynamics is the transfer of energy from small scales to large scales, a process often termed \"backscattering.\" This phenomenon can be understood through the lens of parametric instability, where high-frequency, small-scale turbulence acts as a pump, driving the growth of large-scale fluctuations that might otherwise be stable. This exercise provides a model for this process, allowing you to derive the precise threshold condition where the energy injection from an electron-scale pump overcomes the linear damping of ion-scale modes, leading to their re-energization .",

The leading-order three-wave interaction among the triad is represented by a symmetric coupling coefficient $\\mathcal{C}(\\boldsymbol{k}_{1},\\boldsymbol{k}_{2};\\boldsymbol{k}_{3})\\equiv\\mathcal{C}$, which is nonzero only when the triad geometry satisfies the nonlinear selection rules of the $\\boldsymbol{E}\\times\\boldsymbol{B}$ nonlinearity and obeys the symmetry $\\mathcal{C}(\\boldsymbol{k}_{1},\\boldsymbol{k}_{2};\\boldsymbol{k}_{3})=\\mathcal{C}(\\boldsymbol{k}_{2},\\boldsymbol{k}_{1};\\boldsymbol{k}_{3})$. The EGK energy-conserving structure implies that, in the absence of linear terms, the three-wave system redistributes energy among the triad without net creation.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the slow-time envelope equations governing the ion-scale daughters in the presence of the electron-scale pump can be written as a pair of linear, time-invariant equations for small $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d a_{1}}{d t}=-\\gamma_{1} a_{1}+\\mathcal{C}\\,a_{2}^{*}\\,a_{3},\\qquad\n\\frac{d a_{2}^{*}}{d t}=-\\gamma_{2} a_{2}^{*}+\\mathcal{C}^{*}\\,a_{1}\\,a_{3}^{*},\n$$\nwhere the superscript ${}^{*}$ denotes complex conjugation.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe provided system of equations describes the evolution of the complex amplitudes $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}^{*}$. This is a linear, time-invariant system which can be expressed in matrix form. Let the state vector be $\\boldsymbol{x}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{1}(t) \\\\ a_{2}^{*}(t) \\end{pmatrix}$. The system can then be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{x}}{dt} = \\mathbf{M} \\boldsymbol{x}\n$$\nwhere the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\gamma_{1} & \\mathcal{C} a_{3} \\\\ \\mathcal{C}^{*} a_{3}^{*} & -\\gamma_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe stability of this system is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$. Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue. The solutions to the system are of the form $\\boldsymbol{x}(t) = \\boldsymbol{x}_{0} \\exp(\\lambda t)$. The system is stable if the real parts of all eigenvalues are negative, marginally stable if the largest real part is zero, and unstable if at least one eigenvalue has a positive real part. The problem asks for the condition under which the system becomes unstable, which corresponds to finding the threshold where the largest real part of the eigenvalues becomes positive.\n\nThe eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{M} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\gamma_{1} - \\lambda & \\mathcal{C} a_{3} \\\\ \\mathcal{C}^{*} a_{3}^{*} & -\\gamma_{2} - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant gives the characteristic polynomial:\n$$\n(-\\gamma_{1} - \\lambda)(-\\gamma_{2} - \\lambda) - (\\mathcal{C} a_{3})(\\mathcal{C}^{*} a_{3}^{*}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\lambda + \\gamma_{1})(\\lambda + \\gamma_{2}) - |\\mathcal{C}|^{2} |a_{3}|^{2} = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the eigenvalue $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda^{2} + (\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2})\\lambda + (\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} - |\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2}) = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this equation are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{-(\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2}) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2})^{2} - 4(\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} - |\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2})}}{2}\n$$\nLet's simplify the term under the square root (the discriminant):\n$$\n(\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2})^{2} - 4\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2} = \\gamma_{1}^{2} + 2\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} + \\gamma_{2}^{2} - 4\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2}\n$$\n$$\n= \\gamma_{1}^{2} - 2\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} + \\gamma_{2}^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2} = (\\gamma_{1} - \\gamma_{2})^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2}\n$$\nSince $\\gamma_{1}$ and $\\gamma_{2}$ are real, and $|\\mathcal{C}|$ and $|a_{3}|$ represent magnitudes, the discriminant is always non-negative. Therefore, the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are always real.\nThe two eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = -\\frac{\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2}}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\gamma_{1} - \\gamma_{2})^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2}}}{2}\n$$\nThe system becomes unstable when the larger eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{+}$, becomes positive. The threshold for instability is the point at which $\\lambda_{+} = 0$.\n$$\n\\lambda_{+} = -\\frac{\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\gamma_{1} - \\gamma_{2})^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2}}}{2} = 0\n$$\nTo solve for the critical pump amplitude $|a_{3}|$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\n\\sqrt{(\\gamma_{1} - \\gamma_{2})^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2}} = \\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2}\n$$\nSquaring both sides of the equation yields:\n$$\n(\\gamma_{1} - \\gamma_{2})^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2} = (\\gamma_{1} + \\gamma_{2})^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{1}^{2} - 2\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} + \\gamma_{2}^{2} + 4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2} = \\gamma_{1}^{2} + 2\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2} + \\gamma_{2}^{2}\n$$\nCanceling common terms from both sides gives:\n$$\n4|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}|a_{3}|^{2} = 4\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}\n$$\nSolving for $|a_{3}|^{2}$:\n$$\n|a_{3}|^{2} = \\frac{\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}}{|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}}\n$$\nThe minimum pump amplitude $|a_{3}|$ required for instability is therefore the square root of this expression. We take the positive root as amplitude is a non-negative quantity.\n$$\n|a_{3}| = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}}{|\\mathcal{C}|^{2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}}}{|\\mathcal{C}|}\n$$\nThis expression represents the critical value of the pump amplitude. For any $|a_{3}|$ greater than this value, the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{+}$ will be positive, leading to exponential growth of the ion-scale modes. If $|\\mathcal{C}| = 0$, the threshold becomes infinite, meaning instability is impossible, which is physically correct as there is no coupling.",

The functional forms for the growth rate and saturation spectrum are plausible simplified models. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary functions and parameters for a unique solution. The language is objective and unambiguous. The narrowband assumption $\\sigma \\ll \\sigma_{\\gamma}$ is a standard and well-defined approximation technique used in theoretical physics to simplify integrals where one function in the integrand is much more sharply peaked than others. All criteria for a valid problem are met.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem first asks to justify the integral form for the quasilinear heat flux, $Q_{\\mathrm{QL}}$. The ion heat flux is driven by the correlation between the radial component of the $\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}$ drift velocity fluctuations, $\\tilde{v}_{E,r}$, and the ion pressure fluctuations, $\\tilde{p}_i$. In a spectral description, this leads to a transport level proportional to the sum over modes of the product of the linear growth rate $\\gamma(\\kappa)$ and the saturated mode intensity. The problem encapsulates the mode intensity and other spectral factors in the saturation-weight function $S(\\kappa)$. Thus, the spectral density of the flux is proportional to $\\gamma(\\kappa)S(\\kappa)$, and the total flux is the integral over all contributing wavenumbers:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{QL}} = C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\gamma(\\kappa)\\,S(\\kappa)\\,d\\kappa\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we use the narrowband assumption $\\sigma \\ll \\sigma_{\\gamma}$. The function $S(\\kappa)$ is a narrow Gaussian centered at $\\kappa_p = 0.40$ with a width $\\sigma = 0.05$, while $\\gamma(\\kappa)$ is a much broader Gaussian centered at the same $\\kappa_p$ with a width $\\sigma_\\gamma = 0.20$. Because the integrand is dominated by the narrow peak of $S(\\kappa)$, we can approximate the slowly varying function $\\gamma(\\kappa)$ by its value at the peak, $\\gamma(\\kappa_p) = \\gamma_p$.\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{QL}} \\approx C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\gamma(\\kappa_{p})\\,S(\\kappa)\\,d\\kappa = C\\,\\gamma_{p} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} S_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left[-\\frac{(\\kappa - \\kappa_{p})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right]d\\kappa\n$$\nThe integral is over a Gaussian function. Since the peak at $\\kappa_p = 0.40$ is many standard deviations ($\\sigma = 0.05$) away from the lower integration limit of $0$, we can extend the integration range to $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ with negligible error.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\!\\left[-\\frac{(\\kappa - \\kappa_{p})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right]d\\kappa \\approx \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\!\\left[-\\frac{(\\kappa - \\kappa_{p})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right]d\\kappa = \\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2} = \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}\n$$\nTherefore, the quasilinear heat flux is\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{QL}} \\approx C\\,\\gamma_{p}\\,S_{0}\\,\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the multiscale-suppressed heat flux, $Q_{\\mathrm{MS}}$. The problem states that an additional decorrelation rate $\\omega_E$ from mesoscopic flows modifies the dynamics. The suppression effect on the flux can be modeled by multiplying the original flux spectrum by a factor representing the reduction in transport efficiency. A physically motivated choice for this factor is the ratio of the modified correlation time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{MS}} \\sim [\\gamma(\\kappa) + \\omega_E]^{-1}$ to the original quasilinear correlation time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{QL}} \\sim [\\gamma(\\kappa)]^{-1}$. This suppression factor is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{MS}}/\\tau_{\\mathrm{QL}} = \\gamma(\\kappa)/[\\gamma(\\kappa) + \\omega_E]$. Applying this to the original flux spectrum $\\gamma(\\kappa)S(\\kappa)$ gives the integrand for $Q_{\\mathrm{MS}}$, consistent with the problem statement:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{MS}} = C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\gamma(\\kappa)}{\\gamma(\\kappa) + \\omega_{E}}\\,\\gamma(\\kappa)\\,S(\\kappa)\\,d\\kappa\n$$\nWe evaluate this integral using the same narrowband approximation. The functions $\\gamma(\\kappa)$ and the suppression factor $\\frac{\\gamma(\\kappa)}{\\gamma(\\kappa) + \\omega_{E}}$ are slowly varying compared to the narrow peak of $S(\\kappa)$. We can therefore evaluate these slowly varying terms at the peak wavenumber $\\kappa_p$:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{MS}} \\approx C \\left( \\frac{\\gamma(\\kappa_p)}{\\gamma(\\kappa_p) + \\omega_{E}} \\right) \\gamma(\\kappa_p) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} S(\\kappa)\\,d\\kappa\n$$\nSubstituting $\\gamma(\\kappa_p) = \\gamma_p$ and the previously calculated integral of $S(\\kappa)$:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{MS}} \\approx C \\left( \\frac{\\gamma_p}{\\gamma_p + \\omega_{E}} \\right) \\gamma_p (S_0\\,\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}) = C \\frac{\\gamma_p^2}{\\gamma_p + \\omega_E} S_0 \\, \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R \\equiv Q_{\\mathrm{MS}}/Q_{\\mathrm{QL}}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{MS}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{QL}}} \\approx \\frac{C \\frac{\\gamma_p^2}{\\gamma_p + \\omega_E} S_0 \\, \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{C\\,\\gamma_{p}\\,S_{0}\\,\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\n$$\nThe constant $C$ and the terms $S_0$, $\\sigma$, and $\\sqrt{2\\pi}$ cancel out, leaving a simple expression for the suppression ratio:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\gamma_p}{\\gamma_p + \\omega_E}\n$$\nThis result shows that, under the narrowband approximation, the overall suppression of the integrated heat flux is determined entirely by the suppression factor evaluated at the spectral peak.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided: $\\gamma_p = 0.12$ and $\\omega_E = 0.08$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.08} = \\frac{0.12}{0.20} = \\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a dimensionless decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n\n$R = 0.6000$.",

The streaming frequency for a species $s$ is given by $\\omega_s = k_{\\parallel} v_{\\parallel,s}$. The characteristic parallel velocity is the thermal speed, $v_{\\mathrm{th},s}$. The fastest frequency will involve the species with the highest thermal speed.\n\nThe species temperatures are given as $T_i = 2\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ and $T_e = 2\\,\\mathrm{keV}$. Following the problem's definition for thermal velocity, we first convert these to electronvolts ($eV$):\n$T_i = 2\\,\\mathrm{keV} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{1\\,\\mathrm{keV}} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n$T_e = 2\\,\\mathrm{keV} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{1\\,\\mathrm{keV}} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n\nThe thermal speed for each species $s$ is $v_{\\mathrm{th},s} = \\sqrt{2\\,e\\,T_s/m_s}$, where $T_s$ is given in units of electronvolts.\nFor electrons:\n$m_e = 9.11 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$.\n$$v_{\\mathrm{th},e} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) \\times (2000\\,\\mathrm{eV})}{9.11 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}}} \\approx 2.652 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nFor deuterium ions:\n$m_i = 3.344 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$v_{\\mathrm{th},i} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) \\times (2000\\,\\mathrm{eV})}{3.344 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}}} \\approx 4.378 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nSince $v_{\\mathrm{th},e} \\gg v_{\\mathrm{th},i}$, the electron parallel streaming is the fastest linear process. The maximum linear frequency is:\n$$\\omega_{\\max} = k_{\\parallel} v_{\\mathrm{th},e} = (0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\times (2.652 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) = 1.326 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe linear time step constraint is then:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\text{linear}} \\le \\frac{s_L}{\\omega_{\\max}} = \\frac{0.30}{1.326 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 2.262 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nNext, we address the nonlinear CFL constraint, which arises from the explicit advection by the $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ drift. The constraint is given by $\\Delta t_{\\text{nonlinear}} \\le s_N \\frac{\\Delta x}{v_E}$. We must evaluate this at the smallest resolved grid scales, which correspond to the electron scales, as they have the smaller grid spacing $\\Delta x_e$ and larger wavenumber $k_{\\perp,e}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the magnitude of the electrostatic potential, $\\Phi$. It is set by the dimensionless ratio $\\epsilon = e \\Phi / T_e = 0.02$. The temperature $T_e = 2000\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ is understood as an energy. The quantity $T_e/e$ gives the equivalent voltage, so $T_e/e = 2000\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n$$\\Phi = \\frac{\\epsilon T_e}{e} = 0.02 \\times (2000\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 40\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ drift speed is $v_E = |\\nabla_{\\perp} \\Phi| / B_0$. Using the Fourier approximation $|\\nabla_{\\perp} \\Phi| \\approx k_{\\perp} \\Phi$ at the electron scale:\n$$v_{E,e} \\approx \\frac{k_{\\perp,e} \\Phi}{B_0} = \\frac{(100\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\times (40\\,\\mathrm{V})}{5\\,\\mathrm{T}} = 800\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThe nonlinear CFL constraint is evaluated using the electron grid spacing $\\Delta x_e = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and the nonlinear safety coefficient $s_N = 0.50$.\n$$\\Delta t_{\\text{nonlinear}} \\le s_N \\frac{\\Delta x_e}{v_{E,e}} = 0.50 \\times \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{800\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{800}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nFor completeness, one could check the ion-scale nonlinear constraint, but it is much less restrictive: $v_{E,i} \\approx k_{\\perp,i} \\Phi / B_0 = (5\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1})(40\\,\\mathrm{V})/(5\\,\\mathrm{T})=40\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, leading to $\\Delta t_{N,i} \\leq 0.50 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}) / (40\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) = 1.25 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The electron-scale constraint is indeed the limiting one for the nonlinear term.\n\nFinally, we compare the linear and nonlinear time step limits to find the overall maximum allowed time step $\\Delta t_{\\max}$:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\min(\\Delta t_{\\text{linear}}, \\Delta t_{\\text{nonlinear}})$$\n$$\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\min(2.262 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{s}, 1.25 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s})$$\nThe more restrictive constraint is the linear one from electron parallel streaming.\n$$\\Delta t_{\\max} = 2.262 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in microseconds ($\\mu s$), rounded to three significant figures.\n$1\\,\\mathrm{s} = 10^6\\,\\mu s$.\n$$\\Delta t_{\\max} = (2.262 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times 10^6\\,\\mu s = 0.02262\\,\\mu s$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $0.0226\\,\\mu s$.",
