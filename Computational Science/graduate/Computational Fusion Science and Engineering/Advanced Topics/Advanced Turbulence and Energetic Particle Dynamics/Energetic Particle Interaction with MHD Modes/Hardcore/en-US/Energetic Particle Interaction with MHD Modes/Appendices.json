It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the energetic particle (EP) birth energy and the range of the birth pitch parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nFirst, we determine the EP birth energy, $\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{birth}}$. The problem states that a monoenergetic deuterium neutral beam has an energy of $E_{b} = 82.5\\,\\mathrm{keV}$. It is also assumed that ionization occurs promptly upon the beam's entry into the plasma. In the ionization process, a neutral deuterium atom becomes a deuterium ion. The mass of the stripped electron is negligible compared to the nucleus, and the ionization potential energy is negligible compared to the kinetic energy of the beam. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the resulting energetic ion is, to a very high degree of accuracy, equal to the energy of the parent neutral atom.\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{birth}} = E_{b} = 82.5\\,\\mathrm{keV}\n$$\nThe problem asks for this value to be rounded to four significant figures, which gives $82.50\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n\nNext, we derive an expression for the pitch parameter, $\\lambda$. We are given the following definitions:\n1.  Kinetic energy: $\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}$\n2.  Magnetic moment: $\\mu = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^{2}}{2 B}$\n3.  Pitch parameter: $\\lambda = \\frac{\\mu B_{0}}{\\mathcal{E}}$\n\nSubstituting the definition of $\\mu$ into the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^{2}}{2 B} \\right) B_{0}}{\\mathcal{E}} = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^{2}}{2 \\mathcal{E}} \\frac{B_{0}}{B}\n$$\nFrom the definition of kinetic energy, we can write $m = \\frac{2 \\mathcal{E}}{v^{2}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2 \\mathcal{E}}{v^{2}} \\right) v_{\\perp}^{2}}{2 \\mathcal{E}} \\frac{B_{0}}{B} = \\frac{v_{\\perp}^{2}}{v^{2}} \\frac{B_{0}}{B}\n$$\nThe pitch angle, $\\alpha$, is the angle between the particle's velocity vector $\\vec{v}$ and the local magnetic field vector $\\vec{B}$. The component of the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field is $v_{\\perp} = v \\sin(\\alpha)$. Thus, the ratio of squared velocities is:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{\\perp}^{2}}{v^{2}} = \\frac{(v \\sin(\\alpha))^{2}}{v^{2}} = \\sin^{2}(\\alpha)\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\lambda$ yields the general formula for the pitch parameter in terms of the pitch angle $\\alpha$ and the magnetic field magnitudes:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sin^{2}(\\alpha) \\frac{B_{0}}{B}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that at the birth location of the EPs, the magnetic field magnitude is approximately equal to the on-axis magnitude, i.e., $B \\approx B_{0}$. Applying this approximation, the ratio $\\frac{B_{0}}{B} \\approx 1$. The specialized expression for the birth pitch parameter is therefore:\n$$\n\\lambda \\approx \\sin^{2}(\\alpha)\n$$\nThe problem defines the central injection angle as $\\alpha_{0} = 22^{\\circ}$ and the beam divergence half-angle as $\\Delta \\alpha = 4^{\\circ}$. The range of possible birth pitch angles $\\alpha$ is given by the interval $[\\alpha_{0} - \\Delta \\alpha, \\alpha_{0} + \\Delta \\alpha]$.\nThe minimum pitch angle is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\min} = \\alpha_{0} - \\Delta \\alpha = 22^{\\circ} - 4^{\\circ} = 18^{\\circ}\n$$\nThe maximum pitch angle is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\max} = \\alpha_{0} + \\Delta \\alpha = 22^{\\circ} + 4^{\\circ} = 26^{\\circ}\n$$\nThe function $f(\\alpha) = \\sin^{2}(\\alpha)$ is monotonically increasing for $\\alpha$ in the range $[0^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ}]$. Since the interval $[18^{\\circ}, 26^{\\circ}]$ lies entirely within this range, the minimum and maximum values of $\\lambda$ will occur at $\\alpha_{\\min}$ and $\\alpha_{\\max}$, respectively.\n\nWe now compute the numerical values for $\\lambda_{\\min}$ and $\\lambda_{\\max}$. The angles must be converted from degrees to radians for evaluation in trigonometric functions.\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min} = \\sin^{2}(18^{\\circ}) \\approx (0.309017)^{2} \\approx 0.0954915\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max} = \\sin^{2}(26^{\\circ}) \\approx (0.438371)^{2} \\approx 0.192169\n$$\nRounding these results to four significant figures as required:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min} \\approx 0.09549\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max} \\approx 0.1922\n$$\nThe final results are the EP birth energy, $E_{\\text{EP, birth}} = 82.50\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, and the range for the pitch parameter, $\\lambda \\in [0.09549, 0.1922]$. These are assembled into a single row matrix as requested.",

The threshold for the fishbone instability is reached when the total change in potential energy, $\\delta W = \\delta W_f + \\delta W_k$, is zero.\n\nThe marginal stability condition is given as:\n$$\n\\delta W_f + \\delta W_k = 0\n$$\n\nWe are provided with the expressions for the fluid and kinetic contributions to the potential energy:\n$$\n\\delta W_f \\approx C_f\\,\\frac{B_0^2}{\\mu_0}\\,s\\,\\mathcal{I}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta W_k \\approx -\\,C_k\\,\\frac{R_0}{q_0}\\,\\left.\\frac{\\partial P_{\\mathrm{ep}}}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=r_1}\\,\\mathcal{I}\\,\\mathcal{R}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these into the stability condition yields:\n$$\nC_f\\,\\frac{B_0^2}{\\mu_0}\\,s\\,\\mathcal{I} - C_k\\,\\frac{R_0}{q_0}\\,\\left.\\frac{\\partial P_{\\mathrm{ep}}}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=r_1}\\,\\mathcal{I}\\,\\mathcal{R} = 0\n$$\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the order-unity constants $C_f$ and $C_k$ can be taken as exactly one for the purpose of this simplified model. Applying this simplification ($C_f = 1$ and $C_k = 1$):\n$$\n\\frac{B_0^2}{\\mu_0}\\,s\\,\\mathcal{I} - \\frac{R_0}{q_0}\\,\\left.\\frac{\\partial P_{\\mathrm{ep}}}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=r_1}\\,\\mathcal{I}\\,\\mathcal{R} = 0\n$$\n\nThe mode-structure integral $\\mathcal{I}$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{I} \\equiv \\int_0^{r_1} 4\\pi^2 R_0\\,r\\,|\\xi_r(r)|^2\\,dr\n$$\nUsing the provided trial function for the radial displacement, $\\xi_r(r) = \\xi_0\\,\\frac{r}{r_1}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{I} = \\int_0^{r_1} 4\\pi^2 R_0\\,r\\,\\left|\\xi_0\\,\\frac{r}{r_1}\\right|^2\\,dr = 4\\pi^2 R_0 \\frac{|\\xi_0|^2}{r_1^2} \\int_0^{r_1} r^3\\,dr\n$$\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_0^{r_1} r^3\\,dr = \\left[\\frac{r^4}{4}\\right]_0^{r_1} = \\frac{r_1^4}{4}\n$$\nThus, the mode-structure integral is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{I} = 4\\pi^2 R_0 \\frac{|\\xi_0|^2}{r_1^2} \\left(\\frac{r_1^4}{4}\\right) = \\pi^2 R_0 r_1^2 |\\xi_0|^2\n$$\nFor a non-trivial instability to exist, the mode amplitude must be non-zero, i.e., $\\xi_0 \\neq 0$. Consequently, $\\mathcal{I}  0$. Since $\\mathcal{I}$ is a non-zero common factor in both terms of the stability equation, it can be cancelled:\n$$\n\\frac{B_0^2}{\\mu_0}\\,s - \\frac{R_0}{q_0}\\,\\left.\\frac{\\partial P_{\\mathrm{ep}}}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=r_1}\\,\\mathcal{R} = 0\n$$\n\nWe now rearrange this equation to solve for the threshold energetic particle pressure gradient, $\\left.\\frac{\\partial P_{\\mathrm{ep}}}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=r_1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{R_0}{q_0}\\,\\left.\\frac{\\partial P_{\\mathrm{ep}}}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=r_1}\\,\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{B_0^2}{\\mu_0}\\,s\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{q_0}{R_0\\,\\mathcal{R}}$ isolates the desired quantity:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial P_{\\mathrm{ep}}}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=r_1} = \\frac{s\\,q_0\\,B_0^2}{\\mu_0\\,R_0\\,\\mathcal{R}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the threshold energetic particle pressure gradient at the $q=1$ surface required for the onset of the fishbone instability. The term $\\frac{B_0^2}{\\mu_0}$ has units of pressure (energy density), $s$, $q_0$, and $\\mathcal{R}$ are dimensionless, and $R_0$ has units of length. The resulting expression has units of pressure per unit length (e.g., Pa/m), which is physically correct for a pressure gradient.",
