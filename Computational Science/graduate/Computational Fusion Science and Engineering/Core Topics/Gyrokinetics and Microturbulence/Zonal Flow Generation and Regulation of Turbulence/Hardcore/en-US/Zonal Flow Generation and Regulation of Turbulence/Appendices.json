We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks us to analyze the Electric field cross magnetic field (E$\\times$B) drift velocity in a simplified sheared-slab plasma model and to compute the shear of this flow for a specific potential profile.\n\nFirst, we will demonstrate that for the given conditions, the E$\\times$B drift velocity, $\\mathbf{v}_{E}$, corresponds to a purely poloidal flow. The definition of the drift is given as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{E} = \\frac{c}{B}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}\\times\\nabla \\phi\n$$\nThe problem specifies a Cartesian coordinate system where $(x,y,z)$ correspond to the radial, poloidal, and toroidal directions, respectively.

Thus, $\\phi = \\phi(x)$. We now compute the gradient of this potential, $\\nabla \\phi$. In Cartesian coordinates, the gradient operator is $\\nabla = \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$.

We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe derivation starts from the linearized ion momentum equation in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$. The general form of the equation is:\n$$m_i n_i \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_i}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v}_i \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}_i \\right) = n_i Z_i e (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}_i \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla p_i + \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{visc}}$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{visc}}$ is the viscous force density.\n\nWe apply the assumptions given in the problem statement:\n1.  **Linearization:** For small-amplitude perturbations, the nonlinear advection term $(\\mathbf{v}_i \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}_i$ is second-order and can be neglected.\n2.  **Uniformity:** The density $n_i = n_0$ and temperature $T_i$ are constant, which implies the ion pressure $p_i = n_0 T_i$ is also uniform. Therefore, the pressure gradient term $\\nabla p_i = 0$.\n3.  **Flow:** The ion fluid velocity is given by the $\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}$ drift, $\\mathbf{v}_i = \\mathbf{U}_E$.\n\nWith these simplifications, the momentum equation becomes:\n$$m_i n_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}_E}{\\partial t} = n_0 Z_i e (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{U}_E \\times \\mathbf{B}) + \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{visc}}$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is the Lorentz force on a fluid element. The electrostatic field is $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla\\phi = -(\\partial_x \\phi)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. The flow is $\\mathbf{U}_E = U_y(x,t)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, where $U_y = (\\partial_x \\phi)/B$. Let's evaluate the $\\mathbf{U}_E \\times \\mathbf{B}$ term:\n$$\\mathbf{U}_E \\times \\mathbf{B} = (U_y \\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) \\times (B \\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = U_y B (\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = U_y B \\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$$\nSubstituting the definition of $U_y$:\n$$\\mathbf{U}_E \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial_x \\phi}{B}\\right) B \\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = (\\partial_x \\phi)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$$\nThe total Lorentz force term is then:\n$$\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{U}_E \\times \\mathbf{B} = -(\\partial_x \\phi)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (\\partial_x \\phi)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{0}$$\nThis cancellation is a fundamental property of the lowest-order $\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}$ drift motion. The momentum equation thus simplifies to a balance between inertia and the viscous force:\n$$m_i n_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}_E}{\\partial t} = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{visc}}$$\nFor an incompressible flow with an effective dynamic viscosity $\\mu_{\\perp}$, the viscous force density is given by $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{visc}} = \\mu_{\\perp} \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}_i$. Here, $\\mathbf{v}_i = \\mathbf{U}_E = U_y(x,t)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\nThe Laplacian of the velocity field is:\n$$\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{U}_E = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\right) (U_y(x,t)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\frac{\\partial^2 U_y(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} \\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$$\nsince $U_y$ depends only on $x$ and $t$. The momentum equation in the $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ direction becomes:\n$$m_i n_0 \\frac{\\partial U_y}{\\partial t} = \\mu_{\\perp} \\frac{\\partial^2 U_y}{\\partial x^2}$$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain:\n$$\\frac{\\partial U_y}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\perp}}{m_i n_0} \\frac{\\partial^2 U_y}{\\partial x^2}$$\nAs stipulated by the problem, we define the kinematic viscosity $\\nu \\equiv \\mu_{\\perp}/(m_i n_0)$. The equation for the zonal flow amplitude is a diffusion equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial U_y}{\\partial t} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 U_y}{\\partial x^2}$$\nThis confirms the first part of the problem's request. To find the damping rate, we consider a single Fourier mode solution for $U_y(x,t)$ with wavenumber $k_x$, as specified:\n$$U_y(x,t) = \\hat{U}_y(t) e^{i k_x x}$$\nSubstituting this form into the diffusion equation:\n$$\\frac{d \\hat{U}_y(t)}{dt} e^{i k_x x} = \\nu \\hat{U}_y(t) \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(e^{i k_x x})$$\n$$\\frac{d \\hat{U}_y(t)}{dt} e^{i k_x x} = \\nu \\hat{U}_y(t) (i k_x)^2 e^{i k_x x}$$\n$$\\frac{d \\hat{U}_y(t)}{dt} = - \\nu k_x^2 \\hat{U}_y(t)$$\nThis ordinary differential equation for the time-dependent amplitude $\\hat{U}_y(t)$ has the solution:\n$$\\hat{U}_y(t) = \\hat{U}_y(0) \\exp(-\\nu k_x^2 t)$$\nThe solution shows that the zonal flow amplitude decays exponentially in time. The damping rate, which we denote as $\\gamma(k_x)$, is the coefficient in the exponent:\n$$\\gamma(k_x) = \\nu k_x^2$$\nThis confirms the second part of the problem's request. Finally, we derive the closed-form expression for $\\gamma(k_x)$ using the provided Braginskii viscosity model. We substitute the expressions for the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ and the dynamic viscosity $\\mu_{\\perp}$:\n$$\\gamma(k_x) = \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{\\perp}}{m_i n_0} \\right) k_x^2$$\nNow, substitute $\\mu_{\\perp} = C_{\\perp} \\frac{p_i}{\\nu_{ii}}$ and $p_i = n_0 T_i$:\n$$\\gamma(k_x) = \\left( \\frac{1}{m_i n_0} \\right) \\left( C_{\\perp} \\frac{n_0 T_i}{\\nu_{ii}} \\right) k_x^2$$\nThe number density $n_0$ cancels out:\n$$\\gamma(k_x) = \\frac{C_{\\perp} T_i}{m_i \\nu_{ii}} k_x^2$$\nThe problem specifies the numerical value $C_{\\perp} = 0.96$. Therefore, the final expression for the collisional damping rate of the zonal flow is:\n$$\\gamma(k_x) = 0.96 \\frac{T_i k_x^2}{m_i \\nu_{ii}}$$\nThis expression is in terms of the specified quantities $k_x$, $T_i$, $m_i$, and $\\nu_{ii}$. In the SI system, if $T_i$ is in Joules (i.e., it represents $k_B T_{Kelvin}$), $k_x$ in $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $m_i$ in $\\mathrm{kg}$, and $\\nu_{ii}$ in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, the resulting unit for $\\gamma$ is $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as required for a rate.",

The diffusivity becomes:\n    $$\n    D \\approx \\frac{v^{2}\\tau_{c}}{\\gamma_{E}\\tau_{c}} = \\frac{v^{2}}{\\gamma_{E}}\n    $$\n    Here, the effective correlation time is determined by the shear, $\\tau_{eff} \\approx \\gamma_{E}^{-1}$. The turbulent eddies are torn apart by the shear flow long before they can decorrelate naturally. This leads to a significant reduction in the turbulent diffusivity, representing the regulation of turbulence by the zonal flow shear.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $D$ for the given parameters:\n$$\nv = 4.00 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{c} = 2.50 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{E} = 3.20 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless parameter $\\gamma_{E}\\tau_{c}$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{E}\\tau_{c} = (3.20 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.50 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 0.800\n$$\nSince this value is of order unity, we are in an intermediate regime where both decorrelation mechanisms are important.\nNow, we substitute the values into the derived formula for $D$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{v^{2}\\tau_{c}}{1 + \\gamma_{E}\\tau_{c}} = \\frac{(4.00 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{m/s})^{2} \\times (2.50 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s})}{1 + 0.800}\n$$\n$$\nD = \\frac{(1.600 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s^{2}}) \\times (2.50 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s})}{1.800}\n$$\n$$\nD = \\frac{4.00\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}}{1.800} \\approx 2.2222...\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested by the problem statement, we obtain:\n$$\nD = 2.222\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}\n$$",
