            "problem": "Consider a local flux-tube slab model of a magnetically confined plasma, with radial coordinate $x$ and poloidal-like coordinate $y$. The Geodesic Acoustic Mode (GAM) is the oscillatory zonal component of the flow, which in a fluid limit is driven by the divergence of the turbulent Reynolds stress. In normalized gyro-Bohm units, set $(c/B)=1$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $B$ is the magnetic field strength, and normalize the electrostatic potential by a constant reference such that all computed quantities are dimensionless. Angles must be specified in radians.\n\nThe electric field cross magnetic field (E$\\times$B) velocity is given by $v_x = -\\partial_y \\tilde{\\phi}$ and $v_y = \\partial_x \\tilde{\\phi}$, where $\\tilde{\\phi}(x,y,t)$ is the fluctuating electrostatic potential. The Reynolds stress is defined as $\\Pi_{xy}(x) = \\langle v_x v_y \\rangle$, and the effective GAM source term is the radial derivative of the Reynolds stress, $S_{\\mathrm{GAM}}(x) = -\\partial_x \\Pi_{xy}(x)$, where the angle brackets denote an ensemble average over turbulence realizations.\n\nAssume homogeneous turbulence statistics in $(\\Delta x,\\Delta y)$ and a slowly varying radial envelope of intensity. The two-point correlation function of the electrostatic potential fluctuations is prescribed as\n$$\nC_{\\phi\\phi}(\\Delta x, \\Delta y; x) = \\langle \\tilde{\\phi}(x,y) \\tilde{\\phi}(x+\\Delta x, y+\\Delta y) \\rangle = I(x)^2 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta x^2}{\\lambda_x^2} - \\frac{\\Delta y^2}{\\lambda_y^2}\\right) \\cos\\!\\left(k_x \\Delta x + k_y \\Delta y + \\varphi\\right),\n$$\nwhere $I(x)$ is the turbulence intensity envelope, $\\lambda_x$ and $\\lambda_y$ are correlation lengths, $k_x$ and $k_y$ are characteristic wave numbers, and $\\varphi$ is a constant phase. The radial envelope is\n$$\nI(x) = I_0 \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{L_I}(x - x_c)\\right),\n$$\nwith $I_0$ the reference intensity at $x=x_c$, $L_I$ the radial scale of the envelope, and $\\gamma$ a dimensionless slope parameter.\n\nStarting only from the above definitions, the fluid momentum balance that connects the GAM source term to the divergence of Reynolds stress, and the properties of homogeneous correlations, derive a computable expression for $S_{\\mathrm{GAM}}(x)$ in terms of derivatives of $C_{\\phi\\phi}$ evaluated at zero separation. Then implement a program to numerically evaluate $S_{\\mathrm{GAM}}(x)$ at a specified evaluation radius $x_{\\mathrm{eval}}$ for each of the following test cases, and to evaluate the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ such that $S_{\\mathrm{GAM}} \\propto I_0^\\alpha$ by performing a least-squares linear fit of $\\log S_{\\mathrm{GAM}}$ versus $\\log I_0$ for a group of three cases with identical parameters except differing $I_0$.\n\nUse the following test suite (angles in radians, all quantities non-dimensionalized as stated):\n\n- Test case $1$ (general case): $I_0 = 0.5$, $\\gamma = 0.8$, $L_I = 0.3$, $x_c = 0.0$, $x_{\\mathrm{eval}} = 0.1$, $\\lambda_x = 0.2$, $\\lambda_y = 0.2$, $k_x = 1.2$, $k_y = 0.9$, $\\varphi = 0.3$.\n- Test case $2$ (phase-cancellation edge): same as test case $1$ but with $\\varphi = \\pi/2$.\n- Test case $3$ (anisotropy edge in wave number): same as test case $1$ but with $k_x = 0.0$.\n- Test case $4$ (uniform intensity edge): same as test case $1$ but with $\\gamma = 0.0$.\n- Test case group $5$ (scaling with $I_0$): three cases identical to test case $1$ except $I_0 \\in \\{0.3, 0.6, 1.2\\}$. Compute $S_{\\mathrm{GAM}}$ for each member and then report the fitted scaling exponent $\\alpha$ obtained from the least-squares slope of $\\log S_{\\mathrm{GAM}}$ versus $\\log I_0$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets: $[S_1,S_2,S_3,S_4,\\alpha]$, where $S_j$ are the evaluated effective GAM source terms at $x_{\\mathrm{eval}}$ for test cases $j=1,2,3,4$, and $\\alpha$ is the fitted scaling exponent for test case group $5$. All outputs must be represented as floating-point numbers.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed.

It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of plasma turbulence and fluid dynamics (specifically, the generation of zonal flows like GAMs via Reynolds stress). The definitions are standard, the provided functions are mathematically well-behaved, and the problem is self-contained with all necessary parameters specified for computation. The task is well-posed, leading to a unique solution for each test case.\n\n**Derivation of the Computable Expression for $S_{\\mathrm{GAM}}(x)$**\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three main steps: first, relating the Reynolds stress to the two-point correlation function; second, evaluating the necessary derivatives of the given correlation function; and third, computing the final GAM source term.\n\n1.  **Reynolds Stress and the Correlation Function**\n    The Reynolds stress $\\Pi_{xy}(x)$ at a radial position $x$ is defined as $\\Pi_{xy}(x) = \\langle v_x v_y \\rangle$. Substituting the E$\\times$B velocity components, $v_x = -\\partial_y \\tilde{\\phi}$ and $v_y = \\partial_x \\tilde{\\phi}$, we obtain:\n    $$\n    \\Pi_{xy}(x) = \\langle (-\\partial_y \\tilde{\\phi}) (\\partial_x \\tilde{\\phi}) \\rangle\n    $$\n    To evaluate this average of a product of derivatives at a single point, we express it as the zero-separation limit of a two-point quantity. Let $\\mathbf{r}_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2 = (x_2, y_2)$. The Reynolds stress at $x_1$ can be written as:\n    $$\n    \\Pi_{xy}(x_1) = -\\lim_{\\mathbf{r}_2 \\to \\mathbf{r}_1} \\langle (\\partial_{y_1} \\tilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{r}_1)) (\\partial_{x_2} \\tilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{r}_2)) \\rangle\n    $$\n    Assuming the derivatives commute with the ensemble averaging operator $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$, we get:\n    $$\n    \\Pi_{xy}(x_1) = -\\lim_{\\mathbf{r}_2 \\to \\mathbf{r}_1} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y_1 \\partial x_2} \\langle \\tilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{r}_1) \\tilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{r}_2) \\rangle\n    $$\n    The term $\\langle \\tilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{r}_1) \\tilde{\\phi}(\\mathbf{r}_2) \\rangle$ is the two-point correlation function, given as $C_{\\phi\\phi}(\\Delta x, \\Delta y; x_1)$, where $\\Delta x = x_2 - x_1$ and $\\Delta y = y_2 - y_1$. We re-express the partial derivatives in terms of the separation coordinates $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$ using the chain rule: $\\partial_{x_2} = \\partial_{\\Delta x}$ and $\\partial_{y_1} = -\\partial_{\\Delta y}$. The mixed derivative operator becomes $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y_1 \\partial x_2} = -\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\Delta y \\partial \\Delta x}$. Substituting this result and taking the limit $\\mathbf{r}_2 \\to \\mathbf{r}_1$ (i.e., $\\Delta x \\to 0$, $\\Delta y \\to 0$), we find:\n    $$\n    \\Pi_{xy}(x) = -\\left[ -\\frac{\\partial^2 C_{\\phi\\phi}(\\Delta x, \\Delta y; x)}{\\partial \\Delta y \\partial \\Delta x} \\right]_{\\Delta x=0, \\Delta y=0} = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2 C_{\\phi\\phi}(\\Delta x, \\Delta y; x)}{\\partial \\Delta x \\partial \\Delta y} \\right]_{\\Delta x=0, \\Delta y=0}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Evaluation of the Correlation Function Derivative**\n    The correlation function is of the form $C_{\\phi\\phi}(\\Delta x, \\Delta y; x) = I(x)^2 G(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$, where $G(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$ contains the exponential and cosine terms. The mixed partial derivative of $G$ with respect to $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ must be evaluated at zero separation. Let $F = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta x^2}{\\lambda_x^2} - \\frac{\\Delta y^2}{\\lambda_y^2}\\right)$ and $H = \\cos\\!\\left(k_x \\Delta x + k_y \\Delta y + \\varphi\\right)$. We need to evaluate $\\left[ \\partial_{\\Delta x} \\partial_{\\Delta y} (FH) \\right]_{(0,0)}$. Using the product rule for differentiation and evaluating at $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)=(0,0)$, we find that any term containing a first-order derivative of $F$ is zero, because $\\left.\\partial_{\\Delta x} F\\right|_{(0,0)} = 0$ and $\\left.\\partial_{\\Delta y} F\\right|_{(0,0)} = 0$. Similarly, $\\left.\\partial_{\\Delta x}\\partial_{\\Delta y} F\\right|_{(0,0)} = 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n    $$\n    \\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2 G}{\\partial \\Delta x \\partial \\Delta y} \\right]_{(0,0)} = \\left[ F \\frac{\\partial^2 H}{\\partial \\Delta x \\partial \\Delta y} \\right]_{(0,0)} = F(0,0) \\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2 H}{\\partial \\Delta x \\partial \\Delta y} \\right]_{(0,0)}\n    $$\n    Since $F(0,0) = 1$, we only need the second derivative of $H$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial^2 H}{\\partial \\Delta x \\partial \\Delta y} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\Delta x \\partial \\Delta y} \\cos(k_x \\Delta x + k_y \\Delta y + \\varphi) = -k_x k_y \\cos(k_x \\Delta x + k_y \\Delta y + \\varphi)\n    $$\n    Evaluating at $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)=(0,0)$ gives $-k_x k_y \\cos(\\varphi)$.\n    The Reynolds stress is therefore:\n    $$\n    \\Pi_{xy}(x) = I(x)^2 (-k_x k_y \\cos(\\varphi)) = -k_x k_y \\cos(\\varphi) I(x)^2\n    $$\n\n3.  **Derivation of the GAM Source Term**\n    The GAM source term is $S_{\\mathrm{GAM}}(x) = -\\partial_x \\Pi_{xy}(x)$. Since $k_x$, $k_y$, and $\\varphi$ are constants, the radial derivative acts only on $I(x)^2$.\n    $$\n    S_{\\mathrm{GAM}}(x) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[-k_x k_y \\cos(\\varphi) I(x)^2\\right] = k_x k_y \\cos(\\varphi) \\frac{d(I(x)^2)}{dx}\n    $$\n    Given $I(x) = I_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{L_I}(x - x_c)\\right)$, we have $I(x)^2 = I_0^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\gamma}{L_I}(x - x_c)\\right)$. The derivative is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(I(x)^2)}{dx} = I_0^2 \\cdot \\frac{2\\gamma}{L_I} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\gamma}{L_I}(x - x_c)\\right) = \\frac{2\\gamma}{L_I} I(x)^2\n    $$\n    Substituting this back gives the final expression for the GAM source term:\n    $$\n    S_{\\mathrm{GAM}}(x) = k_x k_y \\cos(\\varphi) \\left(\\frac{2\\gamma}{L_I} I(x)^2\\right) = \\frac{2 \\gamma k_x k_y I_0^2}{L_I} \\cos(\\varphi) \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\gamma}{L_I}(x - x_c)\\right)\n    $$\n    This is the formula to be implemented. Notably, the result is independent of the correlation lengths $\\lambda_x$ and $\\lambda_y$. From this formula, the scaling $S_{\\mathrm{GAM}} \\propto I_0^2$ is apparent, which implies the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ is exactly $2$. Taking the logarithm, $\\log(S_{\\mathrm{GAM}}) = \\log(\\text{const}) + 2 \\log(I_0)$, confirming that a least-squares fit of $\\log(S_{\\mathrm{GAM}})$ versus $\\log(I_0)$ must yield a slope of $2$.",

The element $J_{11}$ simplifies using the steady-state condition $\\gamma_{L} - cA^{\\ast} - bI^{\\ast} = 0$:\n$J_{11} = (\\gamma_{L} - cA^{\\ast} - bI^{\\ast}) - bI^{\\ast} = 0 - bI^{\\ast} = -bI^{\\ast}$.\nThe Jacobian at the steady state, $J^{\\ast}$, is:\n$$ J^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} -bI^{\\ast} & -cI^{\\ast} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ s & -\\omega_{g}^{2} & -\\gamma_{g} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe characteristic equation is $\\det(J^{\\ast} - \\lambda I_{3}) = 0$, where $I_{3}$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix.\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -bI^{\\ast}-\\lambda & -cI^{\\ast} & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\lambda & 1 \\\\ s & -\\omega_{g}^{2} & -\\gamma_{g}-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\nExpanding the determinant along the first column:\n$$ (-bI^{\\ast}-\\lambda)\\left((-\\lambda)(-\\gamma_{g}-\\lambda) - (1)(-\\omega_{g}^{2})\\right) - 0 + s\\left((-cI^{\\ast})(1) - (0)(-\\lambda)\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ (-bI^{\\ast}-\\lambda)(\\lambda^{2} + \\gamma_{g}\\lambda + \\omega_{g}^{2}) - scI^{\\ast} = 0 $$\n$$ -\\lambda^{3} - \\gamma_{g}\\lambda^{2} - \\omega_{g}^{2}\\lambda - bI^{\\ast}\\lambda^{2} - bI^{\\ast}\\gamma_{g}\\lambda - bI^{\\ast}\\omega_{g}^{2} - scI^{\\ast} = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $-1$ and grouping terms by powers of $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda^{3} + (bI^{\\ast} + \\gamma_{g})\\lambda^{2} + (bI^{\\ast}\\gamma_{g} + \\omega_{g}^{2})\\lambda + (bI^{\\ast}\\omega_{g}^{2} + scI^{\\ast}) = 0 $$\nThis is the characteristic polynomial in the canonical form $\\lambda^{3} + a_{1}\\lambda^{2} + a_{2}\\lambda + a_{3} = 0$, with coefficients:\n$a_{1} = bI^{\\ast} + \\gamma_{g}$\n$a_{2} = bI^{\\ast}\\gamma_{g} + \\omega_{g}^{2}$\n$a_{3} = I^{\\ast}(b\\omega_{g}^{2} + sc)$\n\nFor stability of the steady state, the Routh-Hurwitz criteria for a cubic polynomial require $a_{1} > 0$, $a_{3} > 0$, and $a_{1}a_{2} > a_{3}$. A Hopf bifurcation occurs when a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis. This corresponds to the threshold where the third criterion becomes an equality: $a_{1}a_{2} = a_{3}$.\nSince all parameters and $I^{\\ast}$ are positive, $a_{1} > 0$ and $a_{3} > 0$ are always satisfied.
