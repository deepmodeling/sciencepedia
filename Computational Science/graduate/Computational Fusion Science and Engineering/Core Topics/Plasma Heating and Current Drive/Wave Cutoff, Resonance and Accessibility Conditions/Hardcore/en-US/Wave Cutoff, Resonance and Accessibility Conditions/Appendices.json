            "problem": "An ordinary electromagnetic wave (O-mode) of fixed angular frequency $\\omega$ is incident normally from vacuum onto the edge of a magnetically confined fusion plasma whose electron density $n_{e}(x)$ increases monotonically with the position coordinate $x$. The plasma is modeled as a cold electron fluid with immobile ions, and electron collisions and thermal corrections are neglected. The background magnetic field is taken to be uniform and aligned with the wave electric field so that the ordinary mode interacts only with the electron density via the scalar dielectric response. The cold-plasma ordinary-mode permittivity can be expressed in terms of the Stix parameter $P(x)$, defined by $P(x) = 1 - \\omega_{pe}^{2}(x)/\\omega^{2}$, where $\\omega_{pe}(x) = \\sqrt{n_{e}(x) e^{2}/(\\epsilon_{0} m_{e})}$ is the local electron plasma frequency, $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum permittivity, and $m_{e}$ is the electron mass. The $P=0$ layer is the local cutoff where $P(x)$ passes through zero.\n\nStarting from Maxwell’s equations in a dispersive medium and the cold electron fluid model, derive the scalar ordinary differential equation for the transverse electric field amplitude $E(x)$ governing one-dimensional propagation normal to the interface. Then, for a monotonic density ramp resulting in a smooth inhomogeneity, set up the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) solution for $E(x)$ away from the cutoff. Focus attention on a neighborhood of the cutoff $x=0$ where $P(x)$ can be linearized as $P(x) \\approx -\\alpha x$ with $\\alpha0$ constant, and use a uniform approximation to treat the turning-point region consistently. Impose the physical boundary condition of an incident wave from $x0$ and no growing solution for $x0$.\n\nEvaluate the reflectivity, defined as the squared magnitude of the complex reflection coefficient, for this linear $P(x)$ profile under the stated assumptions. Express the final reflectivity as a pure number without units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the reflectivity of an ordinary electromagnetic wave incident on a cold, unmagnetized plasma with a linear density profile near the cutoff.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing wave equation from Maxwell's equations. For a time-harmonic wave with angular frequency $\\omega$, the fields are written as $\\vec{E}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\vec{E}(\\vec{r}) e^{-i\\omega t}$ and $\\vec{B}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\vec{B}(\\vec{r}) e^{-i\\omega t}$. Maxwell's curl equations in a dispersive medium are:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = i\\omega \\vec{B} $$\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = -i\\omega \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_r \\vec{E} $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity. For the ordinary mode (O-mode) described, the wave electric field is parallel to the background magnetic field, and the plasma response is scalar. We are given $\\epsilon_r(x) = P(x)$, where $P(x) = 1 - \\omega_{pe}^2(x)/\\omega^2$ is the Stix parameter. The propagation is in the $x$-direction, so we assume $\\vec{E} = E(x)\\hat{z}$.\n\nTaking the curl of the first equation and substituting the second gives the wave equation:\n$$ \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{E}) = i\\omega (\\nabla \\times \\vec{B}) = i\\omega (-i\\omega \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 P(x) \\vec{E}) = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} P(x) \\vec{E} $$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{E}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E}) - \\nabla^2 \\vec{E}$ and noting that for $\\vec{E} = E(x)\\hat{z}$, we have $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = 0$. The wave equation simplifies to:\n$$ -\\nabla^2 \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} P(x) \\vec{E} $$\nFor one-dimensional propagation, this becomes a scalar ordinary differential equation for the electric field amplitude $E(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 E}{dx^2} + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} P(x) E(x) = 0 $$\nThis is the required differential equation.\n\nThe problem specifies that near the cutoff layer at $x=0$, the plasma profile can be linearized as $P(x) \\approx -\\alpha x$ for a constant $\\alpha0$. Substituting this into the wave equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 E}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\omega^2 \\alpha}{c^2} x E(x) = 0 $$\nThis equation is a form of the Airy equation. To transform it into the canonical form $y''(z) - z y(z) = 0$, we introduce a dimensionless variable $z$:\n$$ z = \\left(\\frac{\\omega^2 \\alpha}{c^2}\\right)^{1/3} x $$\nThe derivatives transform as:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{dz}{dx}\\frac{d}{dz} = \\left(\\frac{\\omega^2 \\alpha}{c^2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{d}{dz} $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\omega^2 \\alpha}{c^2}\\right)^{2/3} \\frac{d^2}{dz^2} $$\nSubstituting these into the wave equation gives:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\omega^2 \\alpha}{c^2}\\right)^{2/3} \\frac{d^2 E}{dz^2} - \\frac{\\omega^2 \\alpha}{c^2} \\left(\\frac{c^2}{\\omega^2 \\alpha}\\right)^{1/3} z E(z) = 0 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\omega^2 \\alpha}{c^2}\\right)^{2/3} \\frac{d^2 E}{dz^2} - \\left(\\frac{\\omega^2 \\alpha}{c^2}\\right)^{2/3} z E(z) = 0 $$\nwhich simplifies to the Airy equation:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 E}{dz^2} - z E(z) = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this equation is a linear combination of the Airy functions of the first and second kind, $\\mathrm{Ai}(z)$ and $\\mathrm{Bi}(z)$:\n$$ E(z) = c_1 \\mathrm{Ai}(z) + c_2 \\mathrm{Bi}(z) $$\nWe must now apply the boundary conditions. For $x0$, we are in the evanescent region where $P(x)0$. This corresponds to $z0$. The asymptotic behaviors of the Airy functions for $z \\to +\\infty$ are:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ai}(z) \\sim \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\pi} z^{1/4}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2}{3} z^{3/2}\\right) \\quad (\\text{decaying solution}) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Bi}(z) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi} z^{1/4}} \\exp\\left(+\\frac{2}{3} z^{3/2}\\right) \\quad (\\text{growing solution}) $$\nThe physical boundary condition states there should be no growing solution for $x0$. This requires the coefficient of the growing Bairy function to be zero, so $c_2 = 0$. The solution is therefore proportional to the Airy function of the first kind:\n$$ E(z) = c_1 \\mathrm{Ai}(z) $$\nTo find the reflectivity, we must analyze the solution in the propagation region $x0$, which corresponds to $z0$. The asymptotic behavior of $\\mathrm{Ai}(z)$ for $z \\to -\\infty$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ai}(z) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi} (-z)^{1/4}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2}{3}(-z)^{3/2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) $$\nWe express the sine function using complex exponentials to separate the incident and reflected waves:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{e^{i\\theta} - e^{-i\\theta}}{2i} $$\nLet $\\phi(z) = \\frac{2}{3}(-z)^{3/2}$. The solution for $z0$ is:\n$$ E(z) \\propto \\frac{1}{(-z)^{1/4}} \\frac{1}{2i} \\left[ \\exp\\left(i\\left(\\phi(z) + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right) - \\exp\\left(-i\\left(\\phi(z) + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ E(z) \\propto \\frac{1}{(-z)^{1/4}} \\left[ \\frac{e^{i\\pi/4}}{2i} e^{i\\phi(z)} - \\frac{e^{-i\\pi/4}}{2i} e^{-i\\phi(z)} \\right] $$\nWe identify the incident and reflected wave components. A wave propagating in the $+x$ direction (incident wave) has a phase dependence of the form $\\exp(i\\int k dx)$. For $x0$, the local wavenumber is $k(x) = \\frac{\\omega}{c}\\sqrt{P(x)} = \\frac{\\omega}{c}\\sqrt{-\\alpha x}$. The phase integral $\\int_x^0 k(x')dx'$ is $\\phi(z)$. Thus, a wave propagating towards $x=0$ (incident wave) has a phase $\\exp(-i\\phi(z))$, and a wave propagating away from $x=0$ (reflected wave) has a phase $\\exp(i\\phi(z))$.\n\nFrom the asymptotic form of $E(z)$, we identify the complex amplitudes:\n- The amplitude of the reflected wave (term with $e^{i\\phi(z)}$) is $A_{refl} \\propto \\frac{e^{i\\pi/4}}{2i}$.\n- The amplitude of the incident wave (term with $e^{-i\\phi(z)}$) is $A_{inc} \\propto -\\frac{e^{-i\\pi/4}}{2i}$.\n\nThe complex reflection coefficient $R$ is the ratio of the reflected amplitude to the incident amplitude:\n$$ R = \\frac{A_{refl}}{A_{inc}} = \\frac{e^{i\\pi/4}/(2i)}{-e^{-i\\pi/4}/(2i)} = -\\frac{e^{i\\pi/4}}{e^{-i\\pi/4}} = -e^{i\\pi/2} $$\nSince $e^{i\\pi/2} = i$, the complex reflection coefficient is $R = -i$.\n\nThe reflectivity $\\mathcal{R}$ is defined as the squared magnitude of the complex reflection coefficient:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = |R|^2 = |-i|^2 = 1 $$\nThis result signifies total reflection. This is physically expected, as the model is lossless (no collisions or other dissipation mechanisms) and the wave is incident on a cutoff region where propagation is forbidden ($P(x)0$), preventing any energy from being transmitted to $x \\to \\infty$. Therefore, all incident energy must be reflected.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of plasma wave theory, is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and free of contradictions. The assumptions made, such as a linear density profile and a local quadratic approximation for the refractive index, are standard modeling choices for obtaining analytical solutions in this field. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to compute the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) tunneling parameter, $\\tau$, defined as:\n$$\n\\tau \\equiv \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} \\kappa(x)\\,dx\n$$\nwhere $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are the positions of the cutoff and resonance, respectively, and $\\kappa(x)$ is the evanescent wavenumber. The evanescent wavenumber is defined in terms of the perpendicular wavevector $k_{\\perp}(x)$ as $\\kappa(x) \\equiv \\sqrt{-k_{\\perp}^{2}(x)}$.\n\nFirst, we express $\\kappa(x)$ using the given relations. We have $k_{\\perp}^{2}(x) = k_{0}^{2}n_{\\perp}^{2}(x)$, so:\n$$\n\\kappa(x) = \\sqrt{-k_{0}^{2}n_{\\perp}^{2}(x)} = k_{0}\\sqrt{-n_{\\perp}^{2}(x)}\n$$\nThe problem provides a local quadratic approximation for the perpendicular refractive index squared, $n_{\\perp}^{2}(x)$, in the vicinity of the cutoff-resonance pair:\n$$\nn_{\\perp}^{2}(x) \\approx -C(n_{e}(x) - n_{c1})(n_{c2} - n_{e}(x))\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a positive constant, and $n_{c1}$ and $n_{c2}$ are the electron densities at the cutoff and resonance. The evanescent region, where $\\kappa(x)$ is real, is defined by $n_{c1}  n_{e}(x)  n_{c2}$. In this region, both factors $(n_{e}(x) - n_{c1})$ and $(n_{c2} - n_{e}(x))$ are positive, making $n_{\\perp}^{2}(x)$ negative, as expected for an evanescent wave.\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for $\\kappa(x)$ yields:\n$$\n\\kappa(x) = k_{0}\\sqrt{-[-C(n_{e}(x) - n_{c1})(n_{c2} - n_{e}(x))]} = k_{0}\\sqrt{C}\\sqrt{(n_{e}(x) - n_{c1})(n_{c2} - n_{e}(x))}\n$$\nThe integral for $\\tau$ is over the spatial coordinate $x$. To evaluate it, we must express the electron density $n_{e}(x)$ as a function of $x$. The problem specifies a linear density profile across the barrier:\n$$\nn_{e}(x) = n_{c1} + \\alpha(x - x_{1})\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the constant density gradient. Using this profile, we can express the terms in the integrand as functions of $x$:\nThe first term is $n_{e}(x) - n_{c1} = \\alpha(x - x_{1})$.\nFor the second term, we first find the relationship between the spatial width of the barrier, $x_{2} - x_{1}$, and the density range, $n_{c2} - n_{c1}$. At the resonance position $x_{2}$, the density is $n_{e}(x_{2}) = n_{c2}$. From the linear profile:\n$$\nn_{c2} = n_{c1} + \\alpha(x_{2} - x_{1}) \\implies n_{c2} - n_{c1} = \\alpha(x_{2} - x_{1})\n$$\nUsing this, the second term becomes:\n$$\nn_{c2} - n_{e}(x) = n_{c2} - [n_{c1} + \\alpha(x - x_{1})] = (n_{c2} - n_{c1}) - \\alpha(x - x_{1}) = \\alpha(x_{2} - x_{1}) - \\alpha(x - x_{1}) = \\alpha(x_{2} - x)\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into $\\kappa(x)$:\n$$\n\\kappa(x) = k_{0}\\sqrt{C}\\sqrt{[\\alpha(x - x_{1})][\\alpha(x_{2} - x)]} = k_{0}\\alpha\\sqrt{C}\\sqrt{(x - x_{1})(x_{2} - x)}\n$$\nNow, we can write the integral for $\\tau$ entirely in terms of $x$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} k_{0}\\alpha\\sqrt{C}\\sqrt{(x - x_{1})(x_{2} - x)}\\,dx = k_{0}\\alpha\\sqrt{C} \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} \\sqrt{(x - x_{1})(x_{2} - x)}\\,dx\n$$\nThe remaining definite integral, $I = \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} \\sqrt{(x - x_{1})(x_{2} - x)}\\,dx$, is a standard form. The integrand describes the upper half of a circle. We can evaluate it by completing the square or using a trigonometric substitution. Let's complete the square for the argument of the square root:\n$$\n(x - x_{1})(x_{2} - x) = -x^{2} + (x_{1} + x_{2})x - x_{1}x_{2} = -\\left[x - \\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}\\right]^{2} + \\left(\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}\\right)^{2} - x_{1}x_{2} = \\left(\\frac{x_{2}-x_{1}}{2}\\right)^{2} - \\left[x - \\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}\\right]^{2}\n$$\nLet $R = \\frac{x_{2}-x_{1}}{2}$ be the radius and $x_{c} = \\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}$ be the center. The integral is $\\int_{x_{c}-R}^{x_{c}+R} \\sqrt{R^{2} - (x-x_{c})^{2}} \\,dx$. This integral represents the area of a semicircle of radius $R$, which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi R^{2}$.\nThus, the value of the integral is:\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi\\left(\\frac{x_{2}-x_{1}}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{8}(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}\n$$\nNow, substitute this result back into the expression for $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau = k_{0}\\alpha\\sqrt{C} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{8}(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2} \\right)\n$$\nWe need to express this in terms of the given physical parameters.

The wave is assumed to propagate strictly perpendicular to the local magnetic field. The decision must be made purely from first principles using the cold plasma dielectric response.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the first wave-particle interaction event—either a cutoff or a resonance—encountered by an extraordinary (X-mode) electromagnetic wave propagating perpendicularly to the magnetic field in a cold, magnetized plasma. The plasma is characterized by one-dimensional radial profiles for electron density $n_e(\\rho)$ and magnetic field strength $B(\\rho)$, where $\\rho \\in [0, 1]$ is the normalized radius from the edge to the core.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem using the provided physical principles. The state of the cold plasma relative to the wave is described by two dimensionless parameters:\n- $X(\\rho) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{pe}^2(\\rho)}{\\omega^2}$, which compares the local electron plasma frequency $\\omega_{pe}$ to the constant wave frequency $\\omega$.\n- $Y(\\rho) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{ce}(\\rho)}{\\omega}$, which compares the local electron cyclotron frequency $\\omega_{ce}$ to the wave frequency $\\omega$.\n\nThe electron plasma frequency $\\omega_{pe}(\\rho)$ depends on the electron density $n_e(\\rho)$ as $\\omega_{pe}^2(\\rho) = \\frac{n_e(\\rho) e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_e}$. The electron cyclotron frequency $\\omega_{ce}(\\rho)$ depends on the magnetic field $B(\\rho)$ as $\\omega_{ce}(\\rho) = \\frac{e B(\\rho)}{m_e}$. The given analytic profiles are:\n$$\nn_{e}(\\rho) = n_{\\text{edge}} + \\left( n_{\\text{core}} - n_{\\text{edge}} \\right) \\rho^{p}\n$$\n$$\nB(\\rho) = B_{\\text{edge}} + \\left( B_{\\text{core}} - B_{\\text{edge}} \\right) \\rho^{q}\n$$\nwhere $n_{\\text{edge}}$, $n_{\\text{core}}$, $B_{\\text{edge}}$, $B_{\\text{core}}$, $p$, and $q$ are specified parameters. The wave angular frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ for a given frequency $f$. All calculations use SI units with the fundamental constants for elementary charge $e$, electron mass $m_e$, and vacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_0$.\n\nThe dispersion relation for the X-mode propagating perpendicularly to the magnetic field is given by $n^2(\\rho) = \\frac{R(\\rho)L(\\rho)}{S(\\rho)}$, where $R$, $L$, and $S$ are the Stix parameters.\n- A **cutoff** occurs when the refractive index $n \\to 0$, which implies $R(\\rho)=0$ or $L(\\rho)=0$.\n- A **resonance** occurs when $n \\to \\infty$, which implies $S(\\rho)=0$.\n\nThese conditions are explicitly defined in terms of $X(\\rho)$ and $Y(\\rho)$:\n1.  **Right-hand (R) cutoff ($R=0$):** $X(\\rho) = 1 + Y(\\rho)$. We define the function $\\varphi_R(\\rho) = X(\\rho) - (1 + Y(\\rho))$ and seek its smallest root in $\\rho \\in [0, 1]$.\n2.  **Left-hand (L) cutoff ($L=0$):** $X(\\rho) = 1 - Y(\\rho)$. We define $\\varphi_L(\\rho) = X(\\rho) - (1 - Y(\\rho))$. This condition is physically valid only when the right-hand side is positive, i.e., $1 - Y(\\rho)  0$. Roots are sought only within this validity domain.\n3.  **Upper-hybrid resonance (UHR, $S=0$):** $X(\\rho) = 1 - Y^2(\\rho)$. We define $\\varphi_{UH}(\\rho) = X(\\rho) - (1 - Y^2(\\rho))$. This is valid only when $1 - Y^2(\\rho)  0$. Roots are sought only within this validity domain.\n\nThe task is to find the smallest $\\rho \\in [0, 1]$ that satisfies any of these three equations within its respective validity domain.\n\nThe algorithmic approach is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, the physical and profile parameters are used to construct the functions $X(\\rho)$ and $Y(\\rho)$. From these, the three event functions $\\varphi_R(\\rho)$, $\\varphi_L(\\rho)$, and $\\varphi_{UH}(\\rho)$ are defined, along with the validity conditions for $\\varphi_L$ and $\\varphi_{UH}$.\n2.  A numerical root-finding procedure is implemented to find the smallest root of each function $\\varphi(\\rho)$ on the interval $[0, 1]$. This procedure, encapsulated in a function `find_smallest_root`, operates by first discretizing the interval $\\rho \\in [0, 1]$ into a fine grid (e.g., $1000$ subintervals).\n3.  The grid is scanned from $\\rho=0$ to $\\rho=1$. For each subinterval $[\\rho_i, \\rho_{i+1}]$, we first check if the interval is within the function's validity domain. If it is, we evaluate the function at the endpoints. A sign change, $\\varphi(\\rho_i) \\cdot \\varphi(\\rho_{i+1}) \\le 0$, indicates that a root is bracketed within this subinterval.\n4.  Upon finding the first such bracket, a more precise numerical solver is invoked. We use Brent's method, as implemented in `scipy.optimize.brentq`, which is a robust and efficient algorithm that combines bisection, the secant method, and inverse quadratic interpolation to find the root within the bracketed interval to high precision.\n5.  This procedure is applied independently to find the smallest valid root for each of the three events: $\\rho_R$, $\\rho_L$, and $\\rho_{UH}$. If a particular event function does not have a valid root in $[0, 1]$, its result is considered infinite.\n6.  The identified roots are compared: $\\rho_{first} = \\min(\\rho_R, \\rho_L, \\rho_{UH})$. The event corresponding to $\\rho_{first}$ is the first one the wave encounters. The integer code for this event ($1$ for R-cutoff, $2$ for L-cutoff, $3$ for UHR) is recorded.\n7.  If no valid roots are found for any of the three events in the interval $[0, 1]$, the result is \"none\", represented by the code $0$.\n\nThis methodology provides a robust and physically correct determination of the first wave interaction event by systematically solving the governing equations numerically, respecting all specified constraints and physical validity domains.",
