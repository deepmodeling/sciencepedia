            "problem": "A large-aspect-ratio tokamak plasma column during ohmic startup and shutdown can be modeled, for transient penetration of toroidal electric fields, as a semi-infinite, uniform, isotropic, resistive slab occupying $x \\ge 0$, with a time-harmonic toroidal loop voltage imposed such that the tangential electric field at the plasma edge ($x=0$) varies sinusoidally at angular frequency $\\omega$. The plasma has uniform resistivity $\\eta$ and magnetic permeability equal to the vacuum value $\\mu_{0}$.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of electromagnetism and magnetohydrodynamics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. The simplified model is a standard and appropriate approximation for the described physical scenario.\n\nWe begin from Maxwell's equations and the resistive Ohm's law. The relevant equations, under the specified assumption that the displacement current is negligible, are Faraday's law of induction and Ampere's law:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_{0} \\vec{J} \\quad (2)\n$$\nThe simplified, resistive Ohm's law relates the electric field $\\vec{E}$ to the current density $\\vec{J}$ through the plasma resistivity $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\vec{E} = \\eta \\vec{J} \\quad (3)\n$$\nWe seek a governing equation for the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$. To achieve this, we take the curl of Ampere's law (2):\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{B}) = \\mu_{0} (\\nabla \\times \\vec{J})\n$$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{A}) - \\nabla^2 \\vec{A}$ and Maxwell's equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0$, the left-hand side simplifies to $-\\nabla^2 \\vec{B}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n-\\nabla^2 \\vec{B} = \\mu_{0} (\\nabla \\times \\vec{J}) \\quad (4)\n$$\nNext, we express $\\nabla \\times \\vec{J}$ in terms of $\\vec{B}$. From Ohm's law (3), assuming uniform resistivity $\\eta$, we have $\\nabla \\times \\vec{J} = \\nabla \\times (\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\vec{E}) = \\frac{1}{\\eta}(\\nabla \\times \\vec{E})$. Substituting Faraday's law (1) gives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{J} = \\frac{1}{\\eta} \\left(-\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into equation (4) yields the governing relation for the magnetic field:\n$$\n-\\nabla^2 \\vec{B} = \\mu_{0} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}\\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the magnetic diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{\\eta} \\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nThe problem models the plasma as a semi-infinite slab occupying $x \\ge 0$. The imposed toroidal electric field is tangential to the surface at $x=0$ and varies only in the direction perpendicular to the surface, $x$. Let the toroidal direction be $\\hat{z}$, so $\\vec{E} = E_z(x, t)\\hat{z}$. From Faraday's law, this implies the corresponding magnetic field (poloidal field in the tokamak context) is in the $\\hat{y}$ direction, $\\vec{B} = B_y(x, t)\\hat{y}$. In this one-dimensional geometry, the Laplacian operator reduces to $\\nabla^2 \\to \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$. The diffusion equation for the magnetic field component $B_y$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 B_y}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{\\eta} \\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial t}\n$$\nWe assume a time-harmonic solution of angular frequency $\\omega$, consistent with the boundary condition. We can represent the fields using complex phasors: $B_y(x,t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\tilde{B}_y(x)e^{j\\omega t}\\}$. Substituting this form into the diffusion equation, the time derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ becomes a multiplication by $j\\omega$. This transforms the partial differential equation into an ordinary differential equation for the complex amplitude $\\tilde{B}_y(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\tilde{B}_y}{dx^2} = \\frac{j\\omega\\mu_{0}}{\\eta} \\tilde{B}_y\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear ODE of the form $\\frac{d^2 \\tilde{B}_y}{dx^2} - k^2 \\tilde{B}_y = 0$, where the complex wavenumber $k$ is given by $k^2 = \\frac{j\\omega\\mu_{0}}{\\eta}$. We can solve for $k$:\n$$\nk = \\sqrt{\\frac{j\\omega\\mu_{0}}{\\eta}} = \\sqrt{j} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\mu_{0}}{\\eta}}\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sqrt{j} = \\sqrt{e^{j\\pi/2}} = e^{j\\pi/4} = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) + j\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1+j}{\\sqrt{2}}$, we find:\n$$\nk = \\frac{1+j}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\mu_{0}}{\\eta}} = (1+j) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\mu_{0}}{2\\eta}}\n$$\nThe general solution for $\\tilde{B}_y(x)$ is $\\tilde{B}_y(x) = C_1 e^{-kx} + C_2 e^{kx}$. For the field to be physically realistic, it must not diverge as $x \\to \\infty$. Since the real part of $k$ is positive, the term $e^{kx}$ would grow without bound. We must therefore set $C_2=0$. The solution is then:\n$$\n\\tilde{B}_y(x) = \\tilde{B}_y(0) e^{-kx} = \\tilde{B}_y(0) \\exp\\left(-(1+j)\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\mu_{0}}{2\\eta}} x\\right)\n$$\nThis can be separated into a spatial attenuation term and a spatial phase-shift term:\n$$\n\\tilde{B}_y(x) = \\tilde{B}_y(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\eta}{\\omega\\mu_{0}}}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-j\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\eta}{\\omega\\mu_{0}}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe governing relation for the spatial attenuation of the oscillatory magnetic field is the exponential decay of its amplitude: $|\\tilde{B}_y(x)| = |\\tilde{B}_y(0)|e^{-x/\\delta}$. The characteristic length scale for this decay is the skin depth, $\\delta$. By inspection of the solution, the skin depth is:\n$$\n\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\eta}{\\omega\\mu_{0}}}\n$$\nNow, we compute the skin depth for the two given cases. The drive frequency is $f=100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, so the angular frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 200\\pi\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$. The permeability of free space is $\\mu_{0}=4\\pi\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H/m}$.\n\nCase 1: Early startup, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{start}}=5.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{start}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(5.0\\times 10^{-5})}{(200\\pi)(4\\pi\\times 10^{-7})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.0\\times 10^{-4}}{8\\pi^2\\times 10^{-5}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{8\\pi^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2\\pi} \\approx 0.355866\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{start}} = 0.3559\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nCase 2: Late shutdown, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{shut}}=1.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{shut}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(1.0\\times 10^{-5})}{(200\\pi)(4\\pi\\times 10^{-7})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.0\\times 10^{-5}}{8\\pi^2\\times 10^{-5}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4\\pi^2}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\approx 0.159155\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{shut}} = 0.1592\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nPhysical Implications:\nThe skin depth $\\delta$ dictates how far the toroidal electric field and the associated poloidal magnetic field penetrate into the plasma. This determines where the ohmic current is driven.\n- During startup, the plasma is cold and has high resistivity ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{start}}$). This results in a large skin depth ($\\delta_{\\mathrm{start}} \\approx 0.36\\,\\mathrm{m}$). This value is a significant fraction of a typical tokamak minor radius (e.g., $a \\sim 0.5 - 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$). This deep penetration is advantageous as it establishes a broad current profile from the outset, which is generally more magnetohydrodynamically (MHD) stable and allows for more efficient heating of the entire plasma volume.\n- During shutdown, the plasma is still hot and has low resistivity ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{shut}}$). This results in a much smaller skin depth ($\\delta_{\\mathrm{shut}} \\approx 0.16\\,\\mathrm{m}$). Changes in the external loop voltage, such as in a ramp-down, will only affect the current in the outer region of the plasma. The current in the hot, highly conductive core is \"frozen-in\" and decays on its own much longer resistive diffusion timescale ($\\tau_R \\sim \\mu_0 a^2 / \\eta$). This leads to a peeling-off of the current from the edge, causing the current profile to become more peaked, which can trigger MHD instabilities like tearing modes and disruptions if not carefully managed.\n- Contrast with Radiofrequency (RF) Heating: RF systems operate at much higher frequencies ($f \\sim 10^7 - 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$), meaning $\\omega$ is many orders of magnitude larger. Since $\\delta \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\omega}$, the classical skin depth at these frequencies is extremely small, typically micrometers to millimeters. The resistive MHD model and the concept of simple field diffusion are no longer applicable. Instead, RF power penetrates the plasma via propagating plasma waves (e.g., electron cyclotron waves, lower hybrid waves, fast waves). The propagation and absorption of these waves are governed by complex dispersion relations involving plasma density, magnetic field strength, and specific resonance/cutoff conditions, allowing for highly localized power deposition, which is a fundamentally different physical mechanism from the diffuse penetration of a low-frequency ohmic field.",

It describes a standard problem in plasma wave theory, specifically concerning the accessibility of electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) waves in a magnetized plasma, which is a core topic in fusion science. The provided parameters are physically realistic for a tokamak plasma. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe propagation of electromagnetic waves in a plasma is governed by Maxwell's equations. Assuming a time-harmonic plane wave of the form $\\mathbf{E}, \\mathbf{B} \\propto \\exp(i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega t))$, Faraday's and Ampere's laws become $\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{E} = \\omega \\mathbf{B}$ and $i \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{B} = i\\omega\\mu_0\\mathbf{J} - \\frac{\\omega}{c^2}\\mathbf{E}$, respectively.

The dispersion relation for the X-mode is:\n    $$N_X^2 = S - \\frac{D^2}{S} = \\frac{S^2 - D^2}{S}$$\n    It is convenient to use the parameters $R = S+D$ and $L = S-D$:\n    $R = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega(\\omega+\\omega_{ce}(x))}$\n    $L = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega(\\omega-\\omega_{ce}(x))}$\n    In terms of these, $S = (R+L)/2$ and $S^2 - D^2 = RL$. So the dispersion relation is:\n    $$N_X^2 = \\frac{RL}{S} = \\frac{2RL}{R+L}$$\n    Cutoffs ($N_X^2 = 0$) occur when the numerator is zero, i.e., $R=0$ or $L=0$.\n    The condition $R=0$ defines the Right-hand (R) cutoff frequency: $\\omega = \\omega_R = \\frac{-\\omega_{ce} + \\sqrt{\\omega_{ce}^2 + 4\\omega_{pe}^2}}{2}$.\n    The condition $L=0$ defines the Left-hand (L) cutoff frequency: $\\omega = \\omega_L = \\frac{\\omega_{ce} + \\sqrt{\\omega_{ce}^2 + 4\\omega_{pe}^2}}{2}$.\n\n**Accessibility Analysis**\n\nA wave launched from the low-field side ($x=0$) can access the fundamental ECR layer at $x=x_r$ if it does not encounter a cutoff in the region $x \\in [0, x_r)$. In this region, the cyclotron frequency $\\omega_{ce}(x)$ increases monotonically from $\\omega_{ce}(0)$ to $\\omega_{ce}(x_r)=\\omega$. A cutoff exists if the condition for $N^2=0$ is met for any $\\omega_{ce}(x)$ in the range $[\\omega_{ce}(0), \\omega)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the relevant frequencies from the given parameters:\n- Wave frequency: $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi (140 \\times 10^9) \\approx 8.796 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n- Electron density: $n_e = 3.0 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n- Electron plasma frequency: $\\omega_{pe} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{19})(1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2}{(9.109 \\times 10^{-31})(8.854 \\times 10^{-12})}} \\approx 3.084 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n- Launch magnetic field: $B(0) = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\n- Cyclotron frequency at launch: $\\omega_{ce}(0) = \\frac{e B(0)}{m_e} \\approx \\frac{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19})(2.5)}{9.109 \\times 10^{-31}} \\approx 4.397 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n- The ECR condition is $\\omega = \\omega_{ce}(x_r)$, so $\\omega_{ce}(x_r) \\approx 8.796 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$. This corresponds to a resonance field $B_{\\mathrm{res}} = m_e \\omega/e \\approx 5.0\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\n\n**O-mode Accessibility ($H_O$):**\nThe O-mode cutoff condition is $\\omega = \\omega_{pe}$. We compare the constant wave frequency $\\omega$ with the constant plasma frequency $\\omega_{pe}$:\n$\\omega \\approx 8.796 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\n$\\omega_{pe} \\approx 3.084 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\nSince $\\omega > \\omega_{pe}$, the plasma is underdense for this wave. The refractive index squared $N_O^2 = 1 - (\\omega_{pe}/\\omega)^2$ is positive and constant throughout the plasma. No cutoff is encountered.\nTherefore, the O-mode can access the ECR layer. We set $H_O=1$.\n\n**X-mode Accessibility ($H_X$):**\nFor X-mode, we check for cutoffs at $\\omega = \\omega_R$ and $\\omega = \\omega_L$. With fixed $\\omega$ and varying $\\omega_{ce}(x)$, we find the cyclotron frequency values $\\omega_{ce,R}$ and $\\omega_{ce,L}$ that satisfy these conditions.\n- R-cutoff: $\\omega = \\omega_R(\\omega_{ce})$ can be rearranged to $\\omega_{ce,R} = \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega} - \\omega$.\n  Since $\\omega > \\omega_{pe}$, $\\omega_{pe}^2/\\omega  \\omega$, which means $\\omega_{ce,R}$ would be negative. A negative cyclotron frequency is not physical. Thus, the R-cutoff is not encountered for a low-field side launch when $\\omega > \\omega_{pe}$.\n- L-cutoff: $\\omega = \\omega_L(\\omega_{ce})$ can be rearranged to $\\omega_{ce,L} = \\omega - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega}$.\n  This cutoff will block the wave if the value $\\omega_{ce,L}$ lies within the range of cyclotron frequencies encountered by the wave, i.e., if $\\omega_{ce}(0) \\le \\omega_{ce,L}  \\omega$.\n  Let's calculate $\\omega_{ce,L}$:\n  $$ \\omega_{ce,L} \\approx (8.796 \\times 10^{11}) - \\frac{(3.084 \\times 10^{11})^2}{8.796 \\times 10^{11}} \\approx (8.796 - 1.081) \\times 10^{11} \\approx 7.715 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s} $$\n  Now we check if this value is in the path. The path of $\\omega_{ce}(x)$ spans $[\\omega_{ce}(0), \\omega)$, which is approximately $[4.397 \\times 10^{11}, 8.796 \\times 10^{11})\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n  We compare the values:\n  $\\omega_{ce}(0) \\approx 4.397 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\n  $\\omega_{ce,L} \\approx 7.715 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\n  $\\omega = \\omega_{ce}(x_r) \\approx 8.796 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\n  Since $\\omega_{ce}(0)  \\omega_{ce,L}  \\omega$, the condition for the L-cutoff is met at some position $x_c \\in (0, x_r)$. The wave will be reflected at this cutoff surface and cannot reach the resonance layer.\n  Therefore, the X-mode cannot access the ECR layer. We set $H_X=0$.\n\n**Calculation of the Accessibility Index ($I$):**\nThe index is defined as $I \\equiv H_O + 2\\,H_X$. Substituting the values we found:\n$$ I = 1 + 2(0) = 1 $$",

            "problem": "A plane electromagnetic wave of the ordinary mode (O-mode) with frequency $f$ is launched from vacuum into a magnetized fusion plasma. The plasma edge region features a pedestal whose transport can raise the electron density $n_e$ above the O-mode cutoff, impeding radiofrequency (RF) accessibility. Consider a simplified, computationally tractable model that captures the essential physics of O-mode accessibility and electron cyclotron (EC) deposition:\n\nFundamental base:\n- Maxwell's equations in a cold, collisionless plasma lead to the O-mode dispersion relation with refractive index $n$ characterized by $n^2 = 1 - \\omega_{pe}^2 / \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ and $\\omega_{pe} = \\sqrt{n_e e^2 / (m_e \\epsilon_0)}$ is the electron plasma frequency. The O-mode cutoff occurs when $\\omega \\le \\omega_{pe}$, equivalently $n^2 \\le 0$, producing evanescence and reflection.\n- Radiative transfer for absorbed power $P(s)$ along a ray path coordinate $s$ obeys $\\frac{dP}{ds} = -\\alpha(s) P(s)$, giving single-pass absorption fraction $F = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\int \\alpha(s)\\, ds\\right)$.\n\nModel assumptions for computation:\n1. The pedestal is treated as a slab of thickness $L$ with a top density $n_{e,\\text{top}}$ that is uniform across the evanescent region when $n_{e,\\text{top}} > n_{\\text{cut}}$, where $n_{\\text{cut}} = \\frac{m_e \\epsilon_0 \\omega^2}{e^2}$. If $n_{e,\\text{top}} \\le n_{\\text{cut}}$, the O-mode is accessible through the edge ($n^2 > 0$ everywhere along the edge path) and there is no evanescent barrier.\n2. The incidence angle relative to the slab normal is $\\theta$ (in radians), so the effective path length through the barrier is $L_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{L}{\\cos \\theta}$.\n3. In the evanescent region, the local wavenumber is imaginary $k = i k_i$ with $k_i = \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2} - 1} = \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{n_{e,\\text{top}}}{n_{\\text{cut}}} - 1}$, and the WKB transmission factor across the rectangular barrier is $T = \\exp\\left(-2 k_i L_{\\text{eff}}\\right)$. If $n_{e,\\text{top}} \\le n_{\\text{cut}}$, set $T = 1$.\n4. The EC absorption in the core is modeled by an absorption coefficient profile $\\alpha(s)$ localized near the cyclotron resonant layer, approximated as a Gaussian with peak $\\alpha_0$ and width $\\sigma$, so the optical depth is $\\tau = \\int \\alpha(s)\\, ds \\approx \\alpha_0 \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\, \\sigma$. A physically motivated scaling is $\\alpha_0 = K\\, n_{e,\\text{core}}$, where $K$ is a constant and $n_{e,\\text{core}}$ is the core electron density. The single-pass core absorption fraction in the absence of a barrier is $F_0 = 1 - e^{-\\tau}$. With the barrier, the accessible power is reduced by $T$, so the core absorption fraction becomes $F_1 = T\\, F_0$.\n5. The quantity to compute for each test case is the change in core EC deposition fraction due to a pedestal density that may rise above the O-mode cutoff, defined as $\\Delta F = F_1 - F_0$, which is dimensionless.\n\nConstants to be used:\n- Elementary charge $e$ in $\\mathrm{C}$, electron mass $m_e$ in $\\mathrm{kg}$, vacuum permittivity $\\epsilon_0$ in $\\mathrm{F/m}$, and speed of light $c$ in $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nUnits and angle specification:\n- Frequency $f$ in $\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n- Densities $n_{e,\\text{edge}}$, $n_{e,\\text{top}}$, and $n_{e,\\text{core}}$ in $\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$.\n- Thickness $L$ and width $\\sigma$ in $\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Angle $\\theta$ in radians.\n- The output $\\Delta F$ is dimensionless (unitless).\n\nTest suite:\nCompute $\\Delta F$ for the following parameter sets. Use the constants $K = 1.0 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}$ and $\\sigma = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$ for all cases, and $n_{e,\\text{core}} = 7.0 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$.\n- Case $1$ (baseline accessible): $f = 1.70 \\times 10^{11}$, $n_{e,\\text{edge}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{19}$, $n_{e,\\text{top}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{20}$, $L = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}$, $\\theta = 0.0$.\n- Case $2$ (thin barrier just above cutoff): $f = 1.70 \\times 10^{11}$, $n_{e,\\text{edge}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{19}$, $n_{e,\\text{top}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{20}$, $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, $\\theta = 0.0$.\n- Case $3$ (typical barrier above cutoff): $f = 1.70 \\times 10^{11}$, $n_{e,\\text{edge}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{19}$, $n_{e,\\text{top}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{20}$, $L = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}$, $\\theta = 0.0$.\n- Case $4$ (grazing incidence increases path length): $f = 1.70 \\times 10^{11}$, $n_{e,\\text{edge}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{19}$, $n_{e,\\text{top}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{20}$, $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, $\\theta = 1.396263402$.\n- Case $5$ (at cutoff): $f = 1.70 \\times 10^{11}$, $n_{e,\\text{edge}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{19}$, $n_{e,\\text{top}} = n_{\\text{cut}}$, $L = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}$, $\\theta = 0.0$. In implementation, set $n_{e,\\text{top}}$ equal to $n_{\\text{cut}}$ computed from the given $f$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[$result$_1$,result$_2$,result$_3$,result$_4$,result$_5]$). Each result must be a float giving $\\Delta F$ for the corresponding case in the specified order.",
            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in plasma physics. All necessary parameters and a complete physical model are provided, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The presence of the variable $n_{e,\\text{edge}}$ in the test suite, which is not used in the provided model equations, is noted as extraneous information but does not impede the calculation. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the change in the core electron cyclotron (EC) power absorption fraction, denoted $\\Delta F$, for a plane electromagnetic wave in the ordinary mode (O-mode) incident on a magnetized plasma. This change arises from the potential presence of an evanescent barrier at the plasma edge. The problem provides a simplified computational model based on fundamental plasma wave theory.\n\nThe calculation proceeds by first establishing quantities that are constant across all test cases, followed by a case-by-case evaluation based on the specific parameters.\n\nFirst, we define the necessary physical constants:\n- Elementary charge: $e \\approx 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{C}$\n- Electron mass: $m_e \\approx 9.1093837 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Vacuum permittivity: $\\epsilon_0 \\approx 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{F/m}$\n- Speed of light in vacuum: $c = 299792458 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate the O-mode Cutoff Density ($n_{\\text{cut}}$)**: The O-mode cutoff occurs when the wave frequency $\\omega$ equals the electron plasma frequency $\\omega_{pe}$. The cutoff density $n_{\\text{cut}}$ is the electron density at which this condition holds. It is derived from $\\omega = \\omega_{pe} = \\sqrt{n_e e^2 / (m_e \\epsilon_0)}$.\n    The angular frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. For the given frequency $f = 1.70 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$:\n    $$ \\omega = 2\\pi (1.70 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\mathrm{Hz}) \\approx 1.06814 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\mathrm{rad/s} $$\n    The cutoff density is then:\n    $$ n_{\\text{cut}} = \\frac{m_e \\epsilon_0 \\omega^2}{e^2} = \\frac{m_e \\epsilon_0 (2\\pi f)^2}{e^2} $$\n    Substituting the values for the constants and frequency, we find:\n    $$ n_{\\text{cut}} \\approx 3.5743 \\times 10^{20} \\, \\mathrm{m^{-3}} $$\n    This value is constant for all test cases since the frequency $f$ is fixed.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Baseline Absorption Fraction ($F_0$)**: The absorption of the wave in the core plasma is characterized by the optical depth, $\\tau$. The problem states $\\tau \\approx \\alpha_0 \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\, \\sigma$, with the peak absorption coefficient given by the scaling $\\alpha_0 = K\\, n_{e,\\text{core}}$. The values $K = 1.0 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\mathrm{m^2}$, $\\sigma = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{m}$, and $n_{e,\\text{core}} = 7.0 \\times 10^{19} \\, \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$ are constant for all cases.\n    $$ \\tau = (1.0 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\mathrm{m^2})(7.0 \\times 10^{19} \\, \\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\sqrt{2\\pi} (2.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{m}) \\approx 3.5089 $$\n    The baseline single-pass absorption fraction, $F_0$, represents the absorption in the absence of an edge barrier and is given by the law of radiative transfer:\n    $$ F_0 = 1 - e^{-\\tau} = 1 - e^{-3.5089} \\approx 0.97009 $$\n    This value is also constant for all test cases.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Case for the Transmission Factor ($T$) and $\\Delta F$**: The change in absorption fraction is $\\Delta F = F_1 - F_0$, where $F_1 = T F_0$ is the absorption fraction with the barrier. This can be simplified to:\n    $$ \\Delta F = T F_0 - F_0 = F_0(T - 1) $$\n    The transmission factor $T$ depends on the pedestal density $n_{e,\\text{top}}$ relative to $n_{\\text{cut}}$.\n\n    - If $n_{e,\\text{top}} \\le n_{\\text{cut}}$, the wave is fully accessible. There is no evanescent barrier, and the transmission factor is $T=1$. In this scenario, $\\Delta F = F_0(1 - 1) = 0$.\n\n    - If $n_{e,\\text{top}} > n_{\\text{cut}}$, an evanescent region exists. The WKB transmission factor for a rectangular barrier is $T = \\exp(-2 k_i L_{\\text{eff}})$.\n      - The imaginary part of the wavenumber is $k_i = \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{n_{e,\\text{top}}}{n_{\\text{cut}}} - 1}$.\n      - The effective path length through the barrier of thickness $L$ at an incidence angle $\\theta$ is $L_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{L}{\\cos \\theta}$.\n\nWe now apply this procedure to each test case:\n\n- **Case 1**: $n_{e,\\text{top}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{20} \\, \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$.\n  Here, $n_{e,\\text{top}}  n_{\\text{cut}}$ ($3.0 \\times 10^{20}  3.5743 \\times 10^{20}$). The wave is accessible.\n  $T = 1$.\n  $\\Delta F = F_0(1-1) = 0$.\n\n- **Case 2**: $n_{e,\\text{top}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{20} \\, \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m}$, $\\theta = 0.0 \\, \\mathrm{rad}$.\n  Here, $n_{e,\\text{top}} > n_{\\text{cut}}$.\n  $k_i = \\frac{1.06814 \\times 10^{12}}{2.9979 \\times 10^8} \\sqrt{\\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{20}}{3.5743 \\times 10^{20}} - 1} \\approx 1229.58 \\, \\mathrm{m^{-1}}$.\n  $L_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\cos(0)} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.\n  $T = \\exp(-2 \\times 1229.58 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = \\exp(-2.459) \\approx 0.0855$.\n  $\\Delta F = 0.97009 \\times (0.0855 - 1) \\approx -0.8872$.\n\n- **Case 3**: $n_{e,\\text{top}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{20} \\, \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, $L = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{m}$, $\\theta = 0.0 \\, \\mathrm{rad}$.\n  Here, $n_{e,\\text{top}} > n_{\\text{cut}}$. $k_i$ is the same as in Case 2.\n  $L_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{\\cos(0)} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.\n  $T = \\exp(-2 \\times 1229.58 \\times 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}) = \\exp(-73.77) \\approx 0$.\n  $\\Delta F = 0.97009 \\times (0 - 1) = -0.97009$.\n\n- **Case 4**: $n_{e,\\text{top}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{20} \\, \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m}$, $\\theta = 1.396263402 \\, \\mathrm{rad}$.\n  Here, $n_{e,\\text{top}} > n_{\\text{cut}}$. $k_i$ is the same as in Case 2.\n  $L_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\cos(1.396263402)} \\approx \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{0.173648} \\approx 5.7588 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.\n  $T = \\exp(-2 \\times 1229.58 \\times 5.7588 \\times 10^{-3}) = \\exp(-14.16) \\approx 7.086 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n  $\\Delta F = 0.97009 \\times (7.086 \\times 10^{-7} - 1) \\approx -0.97009$. The transmission is negligible.\n\n- **Case 5**: $n_{e,\\text{top}} = n_{\\text{cut}}$.\n  The condition is $n_{e,\\text{top}} \\le n_{\\text{cut}}$, which is met at the boundary. The model specifies to set $T=1$.\n  $T = 1$.\n  $\\Delta F = F_0(1 - 1) = 0$. This is physically consistent, as the imaginary wavenumber $k_i$ approaches $0$ as $n_{e,\\text{top}} \\to n_{\\text{cut}}^{+}$, so $T \\to 1$.\n\nThese calculations will be implemented in the provided code structure.",
