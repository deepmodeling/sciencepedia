This exercise  guides you through the fundamental derivation of the ponderomotive force from the Newton–Lorentz equation using a separation of time scales. By applying the result to an electron and a deuteron, you will uncover the critical mass-dependent scaling of acceleration, proportional to $q^2/m^2$, that governs wave-particle interactions in plasmas.",

            "problem": "A one-dimensional model of Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) laser-plasma interaction is considered, in which charged particles experience a linearly polarized, high-frequency electric field with a slowly varying spatial envelope. The electric field is given by\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}(x,t) = \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\, E(x)\\cos(\\omega t), \\quad E(x) = E_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{L^{2}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $E_{0} > 0$ is the peak amplitude, $L > 0$ is the envelope scale length, and $\\omega > 0$ is the angular frequency. Assume the following:\n- The motion is strictly one-dimensional along $x$ and nonrelativistic, so $|\\dot{x}| \\ll c$.\n- The angular frequency $\\,\\omega\\,$ is much larger than any particle cyclotron frequency and any characteristic slow variation rate, ensuring a clear separation of fast quiver motion at frequency $\\,\\omega\\,$ and slow drift due to the envelope gradient.\n- The quiver amplitude is small relative to the envelope scale, $\\,\\left| \\frac{q E_{0}}{m \\omega^{2}} \\right| \\ll L$, so that a multiple-scale expansion is valid.\n\nTwo species start at rest at $x = L/2$: an electron with charge $q_{e} = -e$ and mass $m_{e}$, and a deuteron (hydrogen nucleus with one proton and one neutron) with charge $q_{D} = +e$ and mass $m_{D}$. Treat each particle independently as a test particle in the prescribed field and neglect collective plasma responses and static magnetic fields.\n\nStarting from the Newton–Lorentz equation\n$$\nm\\,\\ddot{x}(t) = q\\,E\\big(x(t)\\big)\\cos(\\omega t),\n$$\nuse a systematic separation of scales by writing $x(t) = X(t) + \\xi(t)$, where $X(t)$ is a slow position evolving over times $T$ with $\\,\\omega T \\gg 1$, and $\\xi(t)$ is a fast oscillatory displacement at frequency $\\,\\omega$ with zero time average.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical mechanics and plasma physics, well-posed with a clear objective, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe motion of a charged particle with mass $m$ and charge $q$ in the given one-dimensional electric field $\\mathbf{E}(x,t) = \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\, E(x)\\cos(\\omega t)$ is described by the Newton–Lorentz equation:\n$$\nm\\ddot{x}(t) = q E(x(t))\\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nWe employ a separation of scales by positing that the particle's trajectory $x(t)$ is a superposition of a slow drift motion $X(t)$ and a fast oscillatory motion $\\xi(t)$:\n$$\nx(t) = X(t) + \\xi(t)\n$$\nHere, $X(t)$ varies on a long time scale, while $\\xi(t)$ oscillates rapidly at the drive frequency $\\omega$ and has a time average of zero, $\\langle \\xi(t) \\rangle = 0$. Consequently, $\\dot{x}(t) = \\dot{X}(t) + \\dot{\\xi}(t)$ and $\\ddot{x}(t) = \\ddot{X}(t) + \\ddot{\\xi}(t)$.\n\nThe assumption that the quiver amplitude is much smaller than the spatial scale of the field envelope $L$ allows us to perform a Taylor expansion of the electric field envelope $E(x)$ around the slow position $X(t)$:\n$$\nE(x(t)) = E(X(t) + \\xi(t)) \\approx E(X(t)) + \\xi(t) \\frac{dE}{dX}\\bigg|_{X(t)} + \\mathcal{O}(\\xi^2)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the equation of motion yields:\n$$\nm(\\ddot{X} + \\ddot{\\xi}) = q \\left[ E(X) + \\xi \\frac{dE}{dX} \\right] \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nWe can separate this equation into components that vary on fast and slow time scales. The dominant fast motion is driven by the main component of the electric field. To leading order, the equation for the fast motion $\\xi(t)$ is:\n$$\nm\\ddot{\\xi} = q E(X) \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nSince $X(t)$ is slowly varying, we can treat $E(X)$ as approximately constant over a single period of the fast oscillation. Integrating this equation twice with respect to time $t$ to find $\\xi(t)$, and keeping only the oscillatory part, we get:\n$$\n\\dot{\\xi}(t) = \\int \\frac{q E(X)}{m} \\cos(\\omega t) dt = \\frac{q E(X)}{m\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\n$$\n\\xi(t) = \\int \\frac{q E(X)}{m\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t) dt = -\\frac{q E(X)}{m\\omega^2} \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nThis expression describes the rapid quiver of the particle in the high-frequency field.\n\nTo find the equation for the slow drift motion $X(t)$, we substitute the expression for $\\xi(t)$ back into the expanded equation of motion:\n$$\nm(\\ddot{X} + \\ddot{\\xi}) = q E(X)\\cos(\\omega t) + q \\left(-\\frac{q E(X)}{m\\omega^2} \\cos(\\omega t)\\right) \\frac{dE}{dX} \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nUsing our leading-order equation for the fast motion, $m\\ddot{\\xi} = q E(X)\\cos(\\omega t)$, we can cancel the fast-oscillating terms on both sides:\n$$\nm\\ddot{X} = -\\frac{q^2 E(X)}{m\\omega^2} \\frac{dE}{dX} \\cos^2(\\omega t)\n$$\nThis equation describes the evolution of the slow position $X(t)$. The term on the right contains both a slowly varying spatial part and a rapidly oscillating time part, $\\cos^2(\\omega t)$. To find the net secular drift, we average this equation over one fast oscillation period $T=2\\pi/\\omega$. Let $\\langle\\cdot\\rangle$ denote the time average.\n$$\n\\langle m\\ddot{X} \\rangle = \\left\\langle -\\frac{q^2 E(X)}{m\\omega^2} \\frac{dE}{dX} \\cos^2(\\omega t) \\right\\rangle\n$$\nSince $X(t)$ and its derivatives are slow, we can treat them as constant over the averaging interval, so $\\langle m\\ddot{X} \\rangle \\approx m\\ddot{X}$. The spatial terms can be moved outside the time average:\n$$\nm\\ddot{X} = -\\frac{q^2 E(X)}{m\\omega^2} \\frac{dE}{dX} \\langle\\cos^2(\\omega t)\\rangle\n$$\nThe time average of $\\cos^2(\\omega t)$ over one period is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$\nm\\ddot{X} = -\\frac{q^2}{2m\\omega^2} E(X) \\frac{dE}{dX}\n$$\nThis is the ponderomotive force. The resulting slow acceleration is:\n$$\n\\ddot{X} = -\\frac{q^2}{2m^2\\omega^2} E(X) \\frac{dE}{dX}\n$$\nWe can rewrite this using the identity $E(X)\\frac{dE}{dX} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d}{dX}(E(X)^2)$:\n$$\n\\ddot{X} = -\\frac{q^2}{4m^2\\omega^2} \\frac{d}{dX}\\left(E(X)^2\\right)\n$$\nThe problem provides the field envelope $E(x) = E_{0}\\exp(-x^{2}/L^{2})$.
