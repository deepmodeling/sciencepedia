The particle's equation of motion is the Lorentz force law:\n$$\nm \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = q \\left( \\mathbf{E}(t,\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}(t,\\mathbf{x}) \\right)\n$$\nThe fields are evaluated at the particle's instantaneous position $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{X} + \\boldsymbol{\\xi}$. Since the quiver amplitude $|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}|$ is small, we can Taylor expand the fields around the slow position $\\mathbf{X}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}(t, \\mathbf{X} + \\boldsymbol{\\xi}) \\approx \\mathbf{E}(t, \\mathbf{X}) + (\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{E}(t, \\mathbf{X})\n$$\nThe oscillatory electric field induces an oscillatory magnetic field according to Faraday's law, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\partial \\mathbf{B}/\\partial t$. Integrating with respect to time gives the magnetic field phasor $\\mathbf{\\tilde{B}} = \\frac{i}{\\omega} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{\\tilde{E}})$, so $\\mathbf{B}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = \\Re\\{\\frac{i}{\\omega}(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}(\\mathbf{x})) e^{-i\\omega t}\\}$.\n\nSubstituting the decomposed motion into the Lorentz force law and keeping terms up to first order in the small quiver quantities, we identify the dominant fast-oscillating terms, which describe the quiver motion:\n$$\nm \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_{\\xi}}{dt} \\approx q \\mathbf{E}(t, \\mathbf{X})\n$$\nIntegrating this equation twice with respect to time yields the quiver velocity and position:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{\\xi}(t) = \\Re\\left\\{ \\frac{q}{m(-i\\omega)} \\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}(\\mathbf{X}) e^{-i\\omega t} \\right\\} = \\frac{q}{m\\omega} \\Im\\left\\{ \\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}(\\mathbf{X}) e^{-i\\omega t} \\right\\}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(t) = \\Re\\left\\{ \\frac{q}{m(-\\omega^2)} \\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}(\\mathbf{X}) e^{-i\\omega t} \\right\\} = -\\frac{q}{m\\omega^2} \\mathbf{E}(t, \\mathbf{X})\n$$\n\nThe equation for the slow motion is obtained by time-averaging the full Lorentz force law. The average force, $\\mathbf{F}_{eff}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{eff} = m \\frac{d\\mathbf{V}}{dt} = \\left\\langle q \\left( \\mathbf{E}(t, \\mathbf{X} + \\boldsymbol{\\xi}) + (\\mathbf{V} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\xi}) \\times \\mathbf{B}(t, \\mathbf{X} + \\boldsymbol{\\xi}) \\right) \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe terms that survive the time-averaging process are those that are products of two oscillating quantities. The non-zero contributions arise from the spatial variation of the fields:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{eff} = q \\left\\langle (\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{E}(t, \\mathbf{X}) \\right\\rangle + q \\left\\langle \\mathbf{v}_{\\xi} \\times \\mathbf{B}(t, \\mathbf{X}) \\right\\rangle\n$$\nWe evaluate these averages. It is convenient to use the identity for the time average of the product of two harmonically oscillating real vector quantities $\\mathbf{A}(t) = \\Re\\{\\mathbf{\\tilde{A}} e^{-i\\omega t}\\}$ and $\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\Re\\{\\mathbf{\\tilde{B}} e^{-i\\omega t}\\}$, which are $\\langle (\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{C})\\mathbf{B} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\Re\\{(\\mathbf{\\tilde{A}}^*\\cdot\\mathbf{C})\\mathbf{\\tilde{B}}\\}$ for a constant vector $\\mathbf{C}$ and $\\langle \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\Re\\{\\mathbf{\\tilde{A}}^* \\times \\mathbf{\\tilde{B}}\\}$.\nThe first term is $q\\langle(\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{E}\\rangle = \\frac{q}{2}\\Re\\{(\\mathbf{\\tilde{\\xi}}^* \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}\\}$. With $\\mathbf{\\tilde{\\xi}} = -\\frac{q}{m\\omega^2}\\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}$, this becomes $-\\frac{q^2}{2m\\omega^2} \\Re\\{(\\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}^* \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}\\}$.\nThe second term is $q\\langle\\mathbf{v}_{\\xi} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\rangle = \\frac{q}{2}\\Re\\{\\mathbf{\\tilde{v}}_{\\xi}^* \\times \\mathbf{\\tilde{B}}\\}$. With $\\mathbf{\\tilde{v}}_{\\xi} = \\frac{iq}{m\\omega}\\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}$ and $\\mathbf{\\tilde{B}} = \\frac{i}{\\omega}(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{\\tilde{E}})$, this becomes $\\frac{q}{2}\\Re\\{(-\\frac{iq}{m\\omega}\\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}^*) \\times (\\frac{i}{\\omega}(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}))\\} = \\frac{q^2}{2m\\omega^2}\\Re\\{\\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}^* \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{\\tilde{E}})\\}$.\n\nCombining the terms and using the vector identity $\\nabla(\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) = (\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B} + (\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{A}\\times(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}) + \\mathbf{B}\\times(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A})$ with $\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}^*$ and $\\mathbf{B}=\\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}$ leads to:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{eff} = -\\frac{q^2}{4m\\omega^2} \\nabla |\\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}(\\mathbf{x})|^2\n$$\nFor this specific problem, the phasor amplitude is a real scalar function $E_0(x,y)$, so $|\\mathbf{\\tilde{E}}|^2 = E_0(x,y)^2$. The force to be computed is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{eff}(x,y) = -\\frac{q^2}{4m\\omega^2} \\nabla \\left( E_0(x,y)^2 \\right)\n$$\n\n### **Numerical Discretization and Algorithm**\n\nWe compute the gradient of the scalar field $U(x,y) = E_0(x,y)^2$ on a uniform Cartesian grid using a hybrid finite difference scheme.\n1.  **Interior Points** ($1 \\le i,j \\le N-2$): Second-order central differences.\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{U_{i, j+1} - U_{i, j-1}}{2 \\Delta x}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{U_{i+1, j} - U_{i-1, j}}{2 \\Delta y} $$\n2.  **Boundary Points**: First-order one-sided differences (forward at minimum index, backward at maximum index).\n\nThe following Python code implements this algorithm and calculates the results for the test cases.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_ponderomotive_force():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the ponderomotive force for specified test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical parameters\n    q = 1.602176634e-19  # Charge in C\n    m = 9.1093837015e-31   # Mass in kg\n\n    # Numerical discretization parameters\n    L = 2.0e-2  # Domain side length in m\n    N = 201    # Number of grid points in each direction (Nx=Ny)\n    \n    # Grid setup\n    x_coords = np.linspace(-L / 2, L / 2, N)\n    y_coords = np.linspace(-L / 2, L / 2, N)\n    dx = dy = L / (N - 1)\n    xx, yy = np.meshgrid(x_coords, y_coords)\n\n    def e_field_gaussian(x, y, E_peak, w):\n        return E_peak * np.exp(-(x**2 + y**2) / w**2)\n\n    def e_field_uniform(x, y, E_uniform):\n        return np.full_like(x, E_uniform)\n\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            'E0_func': lambda x, y, p: e_field_gaussian(x, y, p['E_peak'], p['w']),\n            'params': {'E_peak': 1.0e6, 'w': 5.0e-3},\n            'omega_hz': 170.0e9,\n            'eval_point': (0.0, 0.0)\n        },\n        {\n            'E0_func': lambda x, y, p: e_field_gaussian(x, y, p['E_peak'], p['w']),\n            'params': {'E_peak': 1.0e6, 'w': 5.0e-3},\n            'omega_hz': 170.0e9,\n            'eval_point': (5.0e-3 / 2, 0.0)\n        },\n        {\n            'E0_func': lambda x, y, p: e_field_gaussian(x, y, p['E_peak'], p['w']),\n            'params': {'E_peak': 1.0e6, 'w': 5.0e-3},\n            'omega_hz': 170.0e9,\n            'eval_point': (L / 2, 0.0)\n        },\n        {\n            'E0_func': lambda x, y, p: e_field_uniform(x, y, p['E_uniform']),\n            'params': {'E_uniform': 1.0e5},\n            'omega_hz': 170.0e9,\n            'eval_point': (3.0e-3, -2.0e-3)\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        omega = 2 * np.pi * case['omega_hz']\n        E0 = case['E0_func'](xx, yy, case['params'])\n        U = E0**2\n        \n        dUdx = np.zeros_like(U)\n        dUdy = np.zeros_like(U)\n\n        # dU/dx (along columns)\n        dUdx[:, 1:-1] = (U[:, 2:] - U[:, :-2]) / (2 * dx)\n        dUdx[:, 0] = (U[:, 1] - U[:, 0]) / dx\n        dUdx[:, -1] = (U[:, -1] - U[:, -2]) / dx\n\n        # dU/dy (along rows)\n        dUdy[1:-1, :] = (U[2:, :] - U[:-2, :]) / (2 * dy)\n        dUdy[0, :] = (U[1, :] - U[0, :]) / dy\n        dUdy[-1, :] = (U[-1, :] - U[-2, :]) / dy\n\n        C = -q**2 / (4 * m * omega**2)\n        Fx = C * dUdx\n        Fy = C * dUdy\n        \n        x_eval, y_eval = case['eval_point']\n        ix = np.abs(x_coords - x_eval).argmin()\n        iy = np.abs(y_coords - y_eval).argmin()\n        \n        fx_eval = Fx[iy, ix]\n        fy_eval = Fy[iy, ix]\n        \n        magnitude = np.sqrt(fx_eval**2 + fy_eval**2)\n        results.append(f\"{magnitude:.5e}\")\n        \n    return f\"[{','.join(results)}]\"\n\n# The final answer is generated by running the function above.\n# print(solve_ponderomotive_force())\n```",
