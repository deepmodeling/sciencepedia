            "problem": "Consider a fusion edge-plasma scenario where ions follow a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution at ion temperature $T_i$ and neutrals are cold and stationary. The charge-exchange between ions and neutrals contributes to Molecular Activated Recombination (MAR) and can be implicated in the formation of Multifaceted Asymmetric Radiation From the Edge (MARFE) zones through strong kinetic-neutral coupling. From kinetic theory, the reaction rate coefficient for charge exchange is defined as the average of the product of the cross section and the relative speed over the velocity distribution. Specifically, let the ion mass be $m_i$, the elementary charge be $e$, and the cross section be a function of kinetic energy, $\\sigma_{cx}(E)$.\n\nTask 1 (Derivation): Starting from the Maxwell–Boltzmann speed distribution and the definition of the rate coefficient, derive a closed-form expression for the charge-exchange rate coefficient $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx}(T_i)$ using only fundamental definitions. Assume neutrals are stationary so the relative speed equals the ion speed. Express the final integral in terms of kinetic energy $E$ and explicitly identify the weighting function.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in kinetic theory and computational plasma physics, is well-posed with a clear and complete set of definitions and parameters, and is expressed in objective, formal language. It presents a non-trivial but solvable problem that is a standard exercise in the specified field.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts, corresponding to the tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the Rate Coefficient Integral\n\nThe charge-exchange rate coefficient, $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx}$, is defined as the average of the product of the cross section, $\\sigma_{cx}$, and the relative speed, $v_{rel}$, over the velocity distribution of the interacting particles. Given that the neutrals are stationary, the relative speed is equal to the ion speed, $v_{rel} = v$. The rate coefficient is thus given by the integral over the ion velocity distribution function, $f(\\mathbf{v})$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\sigma_{cx}(|\\mathbf{v}|) |\\mathbf{v}| f(\\mathbf{v}) d^3\\mathbf{v}\n$$\nThe ions are described by a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution in velocity space, which is isotropic. The distribution is given by:\n$$\nf(\\mathbf{v}) = \\left(\\frac{m_i}{2\\pi k_B T_i}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_i |\\mathbf{v}|^2}{2 k_B T_i}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $m_i$ is the ion mass and $T_i$ is the ion temperature. Since the integrand depends only on the magnitude of the velocity, $v = |\\mathbf{v}|$, we can transition from velocity space to speed space by integrating over the solid angle in spherical coordinates. The volume element becomes $d^3\\mathbf{v} = 4\\pi v^2 dv$. This gives the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution, $f(v)$:\n$$\nf(v) dv = 4\\pi v^2 \\left(\\frac{m_i}{2\\pi k_B T_i}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_i v^2}{2 k_B T_i}\\right) dv\n$$\nThe rate coefficient is then an integral over speed from $0$ to $\\infty$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx} = \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{cx}(v) v f(v) dv = \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{cx}(v) v \\left[ 4\\pi v^2 \\left(\\frac{m_i}{2\\pi k_B T_i}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_i v^2}{2 k_B T_i}\\right) \\right] dv\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx} = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{m_i}{2\\pi k_B T_i}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{cx}(v) v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_i v^2}{2 k_B T_i}\\right) dv\n$$\nThe problem requires the integral to be expressed in terms of kinetic energy, $E$. The relationship between speed and kinetic energy is $E = \\frac{1}{2}m_i v^2$. We perform a change of variable from $v$ to $E$:\n$$\nv = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m_i}} \\implies v^3 = \\left(\\frac{2E}{m_i}\\right)^{3/2}\n$$\n$$\ndE = m_i v dv \\implies dv = \\frac{dE}{m_i v} = \\frac{dE}{\\sqrt{2m_i E}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the integral expression:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx} = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{m_i}{2\\pi k_B T_i}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{cx}(E) \\left(\\frac{2E}{m_i}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_i}\\right) \\frac{dE}{\\sqrt{2m_i E}}\n$$\nWe simplify the terms inside the integral:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{2E}{m_i}\\right)^{3/2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2m_i E}} = \\frac{(2E)^{3/2}}{m_i^{3/2}} \\frac{1}{(2m_i E)^{1/2}} = \\frac{2^{3/2} E^{3/2}}{m_i^{3/2}} \\frac{1}{2^{1/2} m_i^{1/2} E^{1/2}} = \\frac{2E}{m_i^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this back and simplifying the prefactor:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx} = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{m_i}{2\\pi k_B T_i}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{cx}(E) \\frac{2E}{m_i^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_i}\\right) dE\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx} = \\frac{4\\pi m_i^{3/2}}{(2\\pi)^{3/2} (k_B T_i)^{3/2}} \\frac{2}{m_i^2} \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{cx}(E) E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_i}\\right) dE\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx} = \\frac{8\\pi m_i^{3/2}}{2\\sqrt{2}\\pi^{3/2} (k_B T_i)^{3/2} m_i^2} \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{cx}(E) E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_i}\\right) dE\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx} = \\frac{\\sqrt{8}}{\\sqrt{\\pi m_i} (k_B T_i)^{3/2}} \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{cx}(E) E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_i}\\right) dE\n$$\nFinal expression in terms of kinetic energy $E$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx}(T_i) = \\left(\\frac{8}{\\pi m_i (k_B T_i)^3}\\right)^{1/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{cx}(E) E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_i}\\right) dE\n$$\nIn this form, the integrand is the product of the cross section $\\sigma_{cx}(E)$ and a weighting function, $w(E)$, where the weighting function is explicitly:\n$$\nw(E) = E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_i}\\right)\n$$\n\nTask 2: Quadrature Scheme Design\n\nTo numerically evaluate the integral, we first simplify the expression. We perform the change of variable $x = E/(k_B T_i)$, which implies $E = x k_B T_i$ and $dE = k_B T_i dx$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{cx}(x k_B T_i) (x k_B T_i) e^{-x} (k_B T_i dx) = (k_B T_i)^2 \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{cx}(x k_B T_i) x e^{-x} dx\n$$\nSubstituting this into the derived expression for $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx}$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx} = \\left(\\frac{8}{\\pi m_i (k_B T_i)^3}\\right)^{1/2} (k_B T_i)^2 \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{cx}(x k_B T_i) x e^{-x} dx\n$$\nSimplifying the prefactor:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{8(k_B T_i)^4}{\\pi m_i (k_B T_i)^3}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{8 k_B T_i}{\\pi m_i}\\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nThe rate coefficient is then:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx} = \\left(\\frac{8 k_B T_i}{\\pi m_i}\\right)^{1/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\left[ \\sigma_{cx}(x k_B T_i) x \\right] e^{-x} dx\n$$\nThis form is ideal for numerical quadrature. The integral is of the form $\\int_0^\\infty f(x) e^{-x} dx$, where the function to be integrated is $f(x) = \\sigma_{cx}(x k_B T_i) x$. The problem specifies using a Gaussian quadrature tailored to the weight function $w(x)=e^{-x}$ on the interval $[0, \\infty)$, which is the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature.\nAn $N$-point Gauss-Laguerre quadrature approximates the integral as a weighted sum:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty f(x) e^{-x} dx \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^N w_j f(x_j)\n$$\nwhere $x_j$ are the roots (abscissas) of the $N$-th Laguerre polynomial $L_N(x)$, and $w_j$ are the corresponding quadrature weights.\nApplying this to our specific case, the integral is approximated by:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{cx}(x k_B T_i) x e^{-x} dx \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^N w_j \\left[ \\sigma_{cx}(x_j k_B T_i) x_j \\right]\n$$\nThe complete algorithmic expression for the discrete approximation of the rate coefficient is:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{cx}(T_i) \\approx \\left(\\frac{8 k_B T_i}{\\pi m_i}\\right)^{1/2} \\sum_{j=1}^N w_j x_j \\sigma_{cx}(x_j k_B T_i)\n$$\nThe values for $\\{x_j, w_j\\}_{j=1}^N$ are standard and can be obtained from computational libraries such as SciPy.\n\nTask 3: Implementation and Evaluation\n\nThe implementation will follow the algorithmic expression derived in Task 2. Key aspects include defining physical constants, setting up the cross-section models, and iterating through the test cases. For each case, the code will calculate the thermal energy $E_T = k_B T_i$ from the input temperature in eV, fetch the Gauss-Laguerre abscissas and weights, compute the sum, and finally calculate the rate coefficient. The problem states that $k_B T_i$ should be interpreted as energy, where $T_i$ in eV is converted to Joules via multiplication by the elementary charge $e$. So, $E_T = T_{i, \\mathrm{eV}} \\times e$.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe volumetric ion momentum sink, denoted as $S_{\\mathrm{mom}}$, represents the rate of ion momentum loss per unit volume due to collisions. In this case, the specified collisional process is charge exchange (CX) between ions and neutral atoms.\n\nThe rate of CX events per unit volume, $R_{\\mathrm{cx}}$, is given by the formula:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{cx}} = \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{cx}} n_i n_n$$\nwhere $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{cx}}$ is the charge-exchange rate coefficient, and $n_i$ and $n_n$ are the ion and neutral number densities, respectively.\n\nA charge-exchange event can be represented as $\\text{D}^+_{\\text{fast}} + \\text{D}^0_{\\text{slow}} \\rightarrow \\text{D}^0_{\\text{fast}} + \\text{D}^+_{\\text{slow}}$. From the perspective of the ion fluid, a fast ion with momentum $m_i u_i$ is effectively lost and replaced by a slow ion that previously had the momentum of a neutral, $m_i u_n$. Therefore, the net momentum lost by the ion fluid in a single CX event is the difference between the initial ion momentum and the final ion momentum (which is the initial neutral's momentum):\n$$\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{event}} = m_i u_i - m_i u_n = m_i (u_i - u_n)$$\nThis represents the directed momentum transferred from the ion population to the neutral population per event.\n\nThe volumetric momentum sink $S_{\\mathrm{mom}}$ is the product of the rate of events per unit volume ($R_{\\mathrm{cx}}$) and the momentum lost per event ($\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{event}}$). Assuming the fluid velocities are collinear, we can work with their magnitudes:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{mom}} = R_{\\mathrm{cx}} \\cdot m_i (u_i - u_n)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{\\mathrm{cx}}$, we arrive at the full formula for the volumetric momentum sink:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{mom}} = \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{cx}} n_i n_n m_i (u_i - u_n)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\n- $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{cx}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s}$\n- $n_i = 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n- $n_n = 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n- $m_i = 3.344 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $u_i - u_n = 500\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{mom}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s}) \\times (10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\times (10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\times (3.344 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (500\\,\\mathrm{m/s})$$\nWe can group the numerical prefactors and the powers of $10$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{mom}} = (1.0 \\times 1.0 \\times 1.0 \\times 3.344 \\times 500) \\times (10^{-14} \\times 10^{19} \\times 10^{18} \\times 10^{-27}) \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{m^2 \\cdot s^2}}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the numerical part:\n$$1.0 \\times 3.344 \\times 500 = 1672$$\nNext, we evaluate the powers of $10$:\n$$10^{-14} \\times 10^{19} \\times 10^{18} \\times 10^{-27} = 10^{-14+19+18-27} = 10^{-14+37-27} = 10^{10-14} = 10^{-4}$$\nCombining these results:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{mom}} = 1672 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{m^2 \\cdot s^2}}$$\nThe units $\\mathrm{kg}/(\\mathrm{m^2 \\cdot s^2})$ are equivalent to $\\mathrm{N/m^3}$, as required, since $1\\,\\mathrm{N} = 1\\,\\mathrm{kg \\cdot m/s^2}$.\nTo express the answer in standard scientific notation and round to four significant figures, we write:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{mom}} = 1.672 \\times 10^3 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{N/m^3} = 1.672 \\times 10^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{N/m^3}$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{mom}} = 0.1672 \\, \\mathrm{N/m^3}$$\nThe result is already at four significant figures, so no further rounding is needed.",
