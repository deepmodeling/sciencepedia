A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe immediate retention fraction, $F_{\\mathrm{ret}}$, is the fraction of the total incident tritium ion flux that is not reflected from the surface and is therefore implanted into the solid. The complementary process is reflection. Based on the principle of particle conservation at the surface, an incident ion is either reflected or retained.\n\nFor a mono-energetic ion flux at energy $E$, the probability of reflection is given by the reflection coefficient $R(E)$. Consequently, the probability of retention (implantation) is $1 - R(E)$.\n\nThe incident ions have an energy distribution described by the probability density function $f(E)$. To find the total retention fraction $F_{\\mathrm{ret}}$, we must average the retention probability $1 - R(E)$ over this energy distribution. This is achieved by computing the flux-weighted average:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ret}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (1 - R(E)) f(E) \\, dE$$\nThis integral can be expanded into two terms:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ret}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(E) \\, dE - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} R(E) f(E) \\, dE$$\nThe first term represents the integral of the probability density function over its entire domain. By definition, a probability density function is normalized to unity:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(E) \\, dE = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{E_{c}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{E_{c}}\\right) \\, dE = \\left[-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{E_{c}}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = 0 - (-1) = 1$$\nThus, the expression for the retention fraction simplifies to:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ret}} = 1 - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} R(E) f(E) \\, dE$$\nThe integral term represents the energy-averaged reflection coefficient, which we denote as $\\langle R \\rangle$.\nNow, we substitute the given expressions for $R(E)$ and $f(E)$ into the integral for $\\langle R \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle R \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( r_{0} + r_{1}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{E_{r}}\\right) \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{E_{c}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{E_{c}}\\right) \\right) dE$$\nWe distribute the terms inside the integral:\n$$\\langle R \\rangle = \\frac{1}{E_{c}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( r_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{E_{c}}\\right) + r_{1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{E_{r}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{E_{c}}\\right) \\right) dE$$\nUsing the property of exponentials, $\\exp(x)\\exp(y) = \\exp(x+y)$, the second term can be simplified:\n$$\\langle R \\rangle = \\frac{1}{E_{c}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( r_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{E_{c}}\\right) + r_{1} \\exp\\left(-E\\left(\\frac{1}{E_{r}} + \\frac{1}{E_{c}}\\right)\\right) \\right) dE$$\nThe integral can be separated into two parts:\n$$\\langle R \\rangle = \\frac{r_{0}}{E_{c}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{E_{c}}\\right) dE + \\frac{r_{1}}{E_{c}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-E\\left(\\frac{E_{c} + E_{r}}{E_{r}E_{c}}\\right)\\right) dE$$\nEvaluating the first integral:\n$$\\frac{r_{0}}{E_{c}} \\left[ -E_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{E_{c}}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = r_{0} \\left[ -\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{E_{c}}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = r_{0}(0 - (-1)) = r_{0}$$\nEvaluating the second integral:\n$$\\frac{r_{1}}{E_{c}} \\left[ -\\frac{E_{r}E_{c}}{E_{c} + E_{r}} \\exp\\left(-E\\frac{E_{c} + E_{r}}{E_{r}E_{c}}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\frac{r_{1}}{E_{c}} \\frac{E_{r}E_{c}}{E_{c} + E_{r}} \\left[ -\\exp\\left(-E\\frac{E_{c} + E_{r}}{E_{r}E_{c}}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = r_{1} \\frac{E_{r}}{E_{r} + E_{c}} (0 - (-1)) = r_{1} \\frac{E_{r}}{E_{r} + E_{c}}$$\nCombining the results for the two parts, we obtain the expression for the averaged reflection coefficient:\n$$\\langle R \\rangle = r_{0} + r_{1} \\frac{E_{r}}{E_{r} + E_{c}}$$\nFinally, we substitute this back into the equation for $F_{\\mathrm{ret}}$ to obtain the required analytic expression:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ret}} = 1 - \\langle R \\rangle = 1 - \\left(r_{0} + r_{1} \\frac{E_{r}}{E_{r} + E_{c}}\\right) = 1 - r_{0} - r_{1} \\frac{E_{r}}{E_{r} + E_{c}}$$\nThis derivation does not involve the parameters $a$ or $m$ from the implantation range kernel, as retention is determined solely by the surface reflection process.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe now substitute the provided numerical values into the derived analytical expression.\n- $r_{0} = 0.20$\n- $r_{1} = 0.50$\n- $E_{r} = 30\\,\\text{eV}$\n- $E_{c} = 50\\,\\text{eV}$\n\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ret}} = 1 - 0.20 - 0.50 \\times \\frac{30}{30 + 50}$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ret}} = 0.80 - 0.50 \\times \\frac{30}{80}$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ret}} = 0.80 - 0.50 \\times 0.375$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ret}} = 0.80 - 0.1875$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ret}} = 0.6125$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The mobile tritium concentration is denoted $C(x,t)$ and the trapped inventory is denoted $N_t(x,t)$. Starting from Fick's law of diffusion and single-species irreversible trapping kinetics under low occupancy, the coupled system is posed as\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - k C,\n\\qquad\n\\frac{\\partial N_t}{\\partial t} = k C,\n$$\nwith zero Dirichlet boundary conditions $C(0,t)=0$ and $C(L,t)=0$ and with initial conditions $C(x,0)=C_0 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ and $N_t(x,0)=0$. Here $D$ is the diffusivity, $k$ is the effective trapping rate constant, and $C_0$ is the initial amplitude. All constants are strictly positive. The slab thickness is $L$, and the final time of interest is $T$.\n\nImplement a time-stepping strategy using operator splitting that separates diffusion and trapping updates. Specifically, construct both the Lie splitting (first apply diffusion over a full time step, then apply trapping over the same step) and the Strang splitting (apply trapping over half a time step, then diffusion over a full time step, then trapping over half a time step). Use a uniform spatial discretization with $N_x$ points, spacing $dx = L/(N_x-1)$, and explicit central-difference updates for the diffusion substep with zero Dirichlet boundaries. For the trapping substep, treat the ordinary differential equations exactly at each spatial point.\n\nStarting only from the above model and the definitions of the numerical procedures, analyze the error and stability properties of the operator-split schemes. Your analysis must be based on first principles: the discretized diffusion operator and the exact local trapping dynamics. You must not assume or quote any target formulas beyond what follows from these fundamentals.\n\nTo make the analysis quantifiable, derive the exact solution for this specific initial-boundary value problem and use it as a reference to compute errors. Then, for both splitting schemes, measure observed orders of accuracy by computing solution errors at multiple time step sizes and estimating the slope of the error-versus-step-size relation on a log-log scale.

Return $p_{\\mathrm{Lie}}$ as a float.\n\n- Test C (order for Strang splitting): Using Strang splitting and the same time steps, estimate the observed order of accuracy $p_{\\mathrm{Strang}}$ for $C$ at time $T$ by the same regression procedure. Return $p_{\\mathrm{Strang}}$ as a float.\n\n- Test D (trapped inventory error): Using Strang splitting and $\\Delta t_0$, integrate to time $T$ and compute the relative $L^2$ error of the trapped inventory $N_t$ against the exact solution.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of reaction-diffusion systems, specifically modeling tritium transport in materials, which is a key topic in computational fusion science. The problem is well-posed, providing a linear partial differential equation system with well-defined initial and boundary conditions, ensuring a unique solution exists. All parameters and numerical procedures are specified without ambiguity or contradiction. The tasks are objective, quantifiable, and designed to test fundamental concepts in numerical analysis, namely operator splitting, accuracy, and stability.\n\nThe problem models tritium transport in a one-dimensional slab of thickness $L$ via a coupled system of partial differential equations for the mobile concentration, $C(x,t)$, and the trapped inventory, $N_t(x,t)$. The governing equations on the domain $x \\in [0,L]$ and $t \\in [0,T]$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - k C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial N_t}{\\partial t} = k C\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the diffusivity, and $k$ is the trapping rate constant. The system is subject to zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, $C(0,t) = 0$ and $C(L,t) = 0$, and initial conditions $C(x,0) = C_0 \\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{L})$ and $N_t(x,0) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we derive the exact analytical solution to serve as a reference for error analysis. The initial condition for $C$ is an eigenfunction of the diffusion operator $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ with the given boundary conditions. We can therefore seek a solution of the form $C(x,t) = f(t) \\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{L})$. Substituting this into the PDE for $C$ yields an ordinary differential equation for $f(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dt} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) = D f(t) \\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) - k f(t) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dt} = -\\left(D\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} + k\\right) f(t)\n$$\nWith the initial condition $f(0) = C_0$, the solution is $f(t) = C_0 \\exp\\left(-\\left(D\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} + k\\right)t\\right)$. Thus, the exact solution for the mobile concentration is:\n$$\nC(x,t) = C_0 \\exp\\left(-\\left(D\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} + k\\right)t\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nTo find the trapped inventory $N_t(x,t)$, we integrate its rate equation with respect to time, using $N_t(x,0) = 0$:\n$$\nN_t(x,t) = \\int_0^t \\frac{\\partial N_t}{\\partial \\tau}(x,\\tau) d\\tau = \\int_0^t k C(x,\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\n$$\nN_t(x,t) = k C_0 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\int_0^t \\exp\\left(-\\left(D\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} + k\\right)\\tau\\right) d\\tau\n$$\nEvaluating the integral gives the exact solution for the trapped inventory:\n$$\nN_t(x,t) = \\frac{k C_0}{D\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} + k} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\left(D\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} + k\\right)t\\right)\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nFor the numerical solution, the spatial domain $[0,L]$ is discretized into $N_x$ points with spacing $dx = L/(N_x-1)$. The system of PDEs is split into a diffusion part and a reaction (trapping) part.\nThe diffusion substep, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}$, is solved using an explicit forward Euler in time and a central difference in space. The update for the concentration $C_i$ at grid point $x_i$ over a time step $\\Delta t$ is given by the operator $\\mathcal{D}_{\\Delta t}$:\n$$\nC_i \\to C_i + \\frac{D \\Delta t}{dx^2} (C_{i+1} - 2C_i + C_{i-1})\n$$\nThis explicit scheme is known from first principles (von Neumann stability analysis) to be stable if and only if the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition $\\frac{D\\Delta t}{dx^2} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$ is satisfied. The critical time step is therefore $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{dx^2}{2D}$, which validates the problem's definition and provides a basis for analyzing Tests E and F.\nThe trapping substep solves the coupled ODEs $\\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC$ and $\\frac{dN_t}{dt} = kC$ at each grid point. For a step of duration $\\Delta t$, the exact solution provides the update operator $\\mathcal{R}_{\\Delta t}$:\n$$\nC_i \\to C_i \\, e^{-k\\Delta t}\n$$\n$$\nN_{t,i} \\to N_{t,i} + C_i (1 - e^{-k\\Delta t})\n$$\nwhere the $C_i$ on the right-hand side is the value at the beginning of the substep.\n\nTwo operator splitting schemes are constructed:\n$1$. **Lie Splitting**: This scheme applies the diffusion step then the reaction step: $\\mathcal{S}_{\\Delta t}^{\\text{Lie}} = \\mathcal{R}_{\\Delta t} \\circ \\mathcal{D}_{\\Delta t}$. This asymmetric composition of operators results in a local truncation error of order $O(\\Delta t^2)$, which integrates to a global error of order $O(\\Delta t)$. Thus, we expect the observed order of accuracy $p_{\\text{Lie}}$ to be approximately $1$.\n$2$. **Strang Splitting**: This scheme uses a symmetric composition: $\\mathcal{S}_{\\Delta t}^{\\text{Strang}} = \\mathcal{R}_{\\Delta t/2} \\circ \\mathcal{D}_{\\Delta t} \\circ \\mathcal{R}_{\\Delta t/2}$. The symmetry of this construction causes the leading term in the local truncation error to cancel, resulting in an error of order $O(\\Delta t^3)$. The global error is therefore of order $O(\\Delta t^2)$, and we expect $p_{\\text{Strang}}$ to be approximately $2$.\n\nTo perform the required tests, a numerical framework is implemented. The relative $L^2$ error between a numerical solution $u_{\\text{num}}$ and the exact solution $u_{\\text{ex}}$ on the discrete grid is computed as $\\sqrt{\\sum_i (u_{\\text{num},i} - u_{\\text{ex},i})^2} / \\sqrt{\\sum_i (u_{\\text{ex},i})^2}$. The order of accuracy $p$ is estimated by performing a linear regression on $\\log(\\text{error})$ versus $\\log(\\Delta t)$ for a sequence of decreasing time steps $\\Delta t$; the slope of this line is $p$. Stability is assessed by tracking the maximum absolute value of the mobile concentration $C$ over the entire simulation domain (space and time) and checking if it remains bounded as specified ($|C| \\le 2C_0$) and finite. The Python code in the final answer implements these principles to compute the required results for all specified tests.",

Two limiting mechanisms for the release flux $J(T)$ are considered: (i) a reaction-limited regime, where the rate-limiting step is thermally activated detrapping/desorption with first-order kinetics, and (ii) a diffusion-limited regime, where the rate-limiting step is bulk transport to a perfectly absorbing surface.\n\nAssume the following foundational models:\n\n- Reaction-limited kinetics: a single dominant thermally activated process with rate $k(T)=k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_t}{k_B T}\\right)$, where $k_0$ is a prefactor, $E_t$ is an activation energy for detrapping/desorption, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It provides a standard, albeit idealized, framework for analyzing thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) data, a common practice in materials science and fusion research. The models for reaction-limited and diffusion-limited release are based on established first principles. The tasks required are standard derivations within this field. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\n### Analysis of Limiting Regimes\n\nFirst, we analyze the peak shape, the peak temperature ($T_p$) dependence on the heating rate ($\\beta$), and the flux scaling for each regime as requested.\n\n#### 1. Reaction-Limited Regime (First-Order Kinetics)\n\nThe release process is governed by a first-order rate equation for the coverage of releasable tritium, $\\theta(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -k(T)\\theta(t)\n$$\nwhere the rate constant is given by the Arrhenius expression $k(T) = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_t}{k_B T}\\right)$. The release flux is $J(t) = k(T)\\theta(t)$.\n\nUsing the chain rule and the linear heating ramp ($dt = dT/\\beta$), we can express the rate of change of coverage with respect to temperature:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dT} = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\frac{dt}{dT} = -\\frac{k(T)}{\\beta}\\theta(T)\n$$\nThe TDS peak occurs at the temperature $T_p$ where the flux is maximum, i.e., $\\frac{dJ}{dT} = 0$. Using the product rule on $J(T) = k(T)\\theta(T)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ}{dT} = \\frac{dk}{dT}\\theta(T) + k(T)\\frac{d\\theta}{dT} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\frac{d\\theta}{dT}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dk}{dT}\\theta(T_p) + k(T_p)\\left(-\\frac{k(T_p)}{\\beta}\\theta(T_p)\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\theta(T_p) \\neq 0$ at the peak, we can divide by it to obtain the condition for the peak temperature:\n$$\n\\frac{dk}{dT}\\bigg|_{T=T_p} = \\frac{k(T_p)^2}{\\beta}\n$$\nThe derivative of the rate constant is:\n$$\n\\frac{dk}{dT} = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_t}{k_B T}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{E_t}{k_B T^2}\\right) = k(T) \\frac{E_t}{k_B T^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the peak condition yields the well-known Redhead equation for first-order desorption:\n$$\nk(T_p) \\frac{E_t}{k_B T_p^2} = \\frac{k(T_p)^2}{\\beta} \\implies \\frac{\\beta E_t}{k_B T_p^2} = k(T_p) = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_t}{k_B T_p}\\right)\n$$\nTo obtain a linear relationship for analysis, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\beta E_t}{k_B T_p^2}\\right) = \\ln(k_0) - \\frac{E_t}{k_B T_p}\n$$\nRearranging gives the Kissinger equation:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{T_p^2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_0 k_B}{E_t}\\right) - \\frac{E_t}{k_B T_p}\n$$\nThis equation shows that for a first-order reaction-limited process, a plot of $\\ln(\\beta/T_p^2)$ versus $1/T_p$ from experiments at different heating rates $\\beta$ will yield a straight line. The slope of this line is $-\\frac{E_t}{k_B}$, from which the activation energy $E_t$ can be determined.\n\nFor the leading edge of the TDS peak (low temperature, low desorption), the coverage $\\theta(T)$ can be approximated as constant, $\\theta(T) \\approx \\theta_0$. The flux is then:\n$$\nJ(T) \\approx \\theta_0 k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_t}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nIn this regime, the flux $J(T)$ at a given temperature $T$ is independent of the heating rate $\\beta$. Thus, the scaling is with $\\beta^0$.\n\n#### 2. Diffusion-Limited Regime\n\nThe governing equation is the one-dimensional diffusion equation with a temperature-dependent diffusion coefficient $D(T) = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(D(T)\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right)\n$$\nWith the initial condition $C(x,0)=C_0$ and boundary condition $C(0,t)=0$. To solve this, we introduce an effective time variable $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau(t) = \\int_0^t D(T(t')) dt'\n$$\nThe diffusion equation transforms to the standard form with a unit diffusion coefficient:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe solution for a semi-infinite medium with the given boundary and initial conditions is:\n$$\nC(x,\\tau) = C_0 \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\tau}}\\right)\n$$\nThe release flux at the surface is $J(t) = -D(t) \\left.\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0}$. The concentration gradient at $x=0$ is:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0} = C_0 \\left.\\left[\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4\\tau}\\right) \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\tau}}\\right]\\right|_{x=0} = \\frac{C_0}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\tau}}\n$$\nThus, the release flux (a positive quantity) is:\n$$\nJ(t) = D(t) \\frac{C_0}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\tau(t)}}\n$$\nUnder a linear heating ramp, $\\tau$ becomes an integral over temperature:\n$$\n\\tau(T) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\int_{T_0}^T D(T') dT' = \\frac{D_0}{\\beta} \\int_{T_0}^T \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_D}{k_B T'}\\right) dT'\n$$\nFor the leading edge of the TDS peak, this integral can be evaluated with a standard asymptotic approximation:\n$$\n\\int_{T_0}^T \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_D}{k_B T'}\\right) dT' \\approx \\frac{k_B T^2}{E_D} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\tau(T)$:\n$$\n\\tau(T) \\approx \\frac{D_0}{\\beta} \\frac{k_B T^2}{E_D} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{D(T)}{\\beta} \\frac{k_B T^2}{E_D}\n$$\nNow, we find the flux $J(T)$:\n$$\nJ(T) \\approx D(T) \\frac{C_0}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\frac{D(T)k_B T^2}{\\beta E_D}}} = C_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta E_D D(T)}{\\pi k_B T^2}}\n$$\nSubstituting $D(T) = D_0 \\exp(-E_D / (k_B T))$:\n$$\nJ(T) \\approx C_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta E_D D_0}{\\pi k_B T^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_D}{2 k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nFrom this leading-edge approximation, we can extract two crucial distinguishing features:\n1.  **Scaling with $\\beta$**: The flux magnitude at a given temperature $T$ is proportional to $\\sqrt{\\beta}$, i.e., $J(T) \\propto \\beta^{1/2}$. This contrasts sharply with the $\\beta^0$ scaling of the reaction-limited case.\n2.  **Arrhenius Analysis**: Taking the logarithm, we get:\n    $$\n    \\ln J(T) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\beta - \\ln T + \\text{constant} - \\frac{E_D}{2 k_B T}\n    $$\n    A plot of $\\ln J$ versus $1/T$ on the leading edge will be approximately linear with a slope of $-\\frac{E_D}{2k_B}$. Note the factor of 2 in the denominator, which distinguishes it from a simple activated process where the slope would be $-\\frac{E_D}{k_B}$.\n\n**Peak Shape Asymmetry**: In the diffusion-limited case, the release is initially rapid as $D(T)$ increases exponentially. However, as the region near the surface ($x=0$) is depleted of tritium, the flux becomes limited by the time it takes for tritium to diffuse from deeper in the bulk. This diffusion lengthscale, proportional to $\\sqrt{\\tau}$, grows with time. The concentration gradient at the surface, $\\left. \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=0} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\tau}}$, decreases, leading to a long, slow decay of the flux on the high-temperature side of the peak. This results in a characteristically asymmetric peak shape, broader than a typical first-order reaction peak.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nWe now evaluate each statement based on these derivations.\n\n**A. In the reaction-limited regime with first-order kinetics, a Kissinger plot of $\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{T_p^2}\\right)$ versus $\\frac{1}{T_p}$ is linear with slope $-\\frac{E_t}{k_B}$. In the diffusion-limited regime for a semi-infinite slab, the leading edge of $\\ln J$ versus $\\frac{1}{T}$ is linear with slope $-\\frac{E_D}{2 k_B}$ and the leading-edge magnitude scales as $\\beta^{1/2}$, not $\\beta^0$.**\n\n*   **Reaction-limited part**: \"a Kissinger plot of $\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{T_p^2}\\right)$ versus $\\frac{1}{T_p}$ is linear with slope $-\\frac{E_t}{k_B}$\" — This is precisely what was derived. Correct.\n*   **Diffusion-limited part 1**: \"the leading edge of $\\ln J$ versus $\\frac{1}{T}$ is linear with slope $-\\frac{E_D}{2 k_B}$\" — This matches our leading-edge analysis. Correct.\n*   **Diffusion-limited part 2**: \"the leading-edge magnitude scales as $\\beta^{1/2}$, not $\\beta^0$\" — This also matches our derivation and correctly contrasts with the reaction-limited case. Correct.\n\nThis statement provides a complete and correct set of criteria.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. In the reaction-limited regime with first-order kinetics, a Kissinger plot of $\\ln \\beta$ versus $\\frac{1}{T_p}$ is linear with slope $-\\frac{E_t}{2 k_B}$. In the diffusion-limited regime for a semi-infinite slab, the leading edge of $\\ln J$ versus $\\frac{1}{T}$ is linear with slope $-\\frac{E_D}{k_B}$ and the leading-edge magnitude is independent of $\\beta$.**\n\n*   **Reaction-limited part**: A plot of $\\ln \\beta$ versus $1/T_p$ is not strictly linear due to the $T_p^2$ term in the Redhead equation. Even in approximations that neglect this term, the slope would be $-E_t/k_B$, not $-E_t/(2k_B)$. Incorrect.\n*   **Diffusion-limited part 1**: The slope of the leading-edge Arrhenius plot is $-\\frac{E_D}{2k_B}$, not $-\\frac{E_D}{k_B}$. Incorrect.\n*   **Diffusion-limited part 2**: The leading-edge magnitude scales as $\\beta^{1/2}$, it is not independent of $\\beta$. Incorrect.\n\nThis statement is incorrect on all points.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. In the reaction-limited regime, the leading-edge $J(T)$ scales as $\\beta^{1/2}$ and the Kissinger plot of $\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{T_p^2}\\right)$ versus $\\frac{1}{T_p}$ is nonlinear. In the diffusion-limited regime, the Kissinger plot of $\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{T_p^2}\\right)$ versus $\\frac{1}{T_p}$ is linear with slope $-\\frac{E_D}{k_B}$.**\n\n*   **Reaction-limited part**: The scaling is $\\beta^0$, not $\\beta^{1/2}$, and the Kissinger plot is linear for first-order kinetics. This statement confuses the properties of the two regimes. Incorrect.\n*   **Diffusion-limited part**: The Kissinger plot is generally *not* linear for a diffusion-limited process from a semi-infinite source. The underlying physics does not conform to the assumptions of the Kissinger analysis. Incorrect.\n\nThis statement is factually incorrect and misattributes properties.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Both reaction-limited and diffusion-limited regimes produce the same linear Kissinger plot of $\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{T_p^2}\\right)$ versus $\\frac{1}{T_p}$ with slope $-\\frac{E}{k_B}$, and neither shows a leading-edge scaling of $J(T)$ with $\\beta$.**\n\n*   **Kissinger plot part**: As established, the Kissinger plot is linear for the reaction-limited case but not for the diffusion-limited case. Incorrect.\n*   **Scaling part**: The diffusion-limited flux scales as $\\beta^{1/2}$. Incorrect.\n\nThis statement incorrectly conflates the behavior of the two distinct regimes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the rigorous derivations from the foundational models provided, only statement A presents a set of criteria that is both correct and practically useful for distinguishing between reaction-limited and diffusion-limited tritium release in TDS experiments.",
