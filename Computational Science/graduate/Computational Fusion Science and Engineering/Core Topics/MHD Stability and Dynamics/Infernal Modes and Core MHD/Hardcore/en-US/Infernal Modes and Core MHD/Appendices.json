            "problem": "In the study of core magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the stability of infernal modes in toroidal plasmas, the safety factor $q(r)$ is a key geometric quantity that depends on the local pitch of the magnetic field lines. Consider a large-aspect-ratio, axisymmetric tokamak with circular, concentric magnetic flux surfaces. Let the major radius be $R_{0}$, the minor radius be $a$, and let the toroidal magnetic field be approximately constant across the minor radius at leading order, $B_{\\phi}(r) \\approx B_{\\phi 0}$, due to $R \\approx R_{0}$ in the large-aspect-ratio limit. Assume low plasma pressure so that the magnetostatic relation for the poloidal field generated by the toroidal plasma current is obtained from Ampère’s law without requiring force balance. The toroidal current density profile is prescribed as\n$$\nj_{\\phi}(r) = j_{0} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}} \\right),\n$$\nfor $0 \\le r \\le a$, where $j_{0}$ is a positive constant. Starting from first principles, namely (i) the field-line definition of the safety factor as the toroidal transits per poloidal circuit and (ii) the integral form of Ampère’s law, derive the relation between the safety factor $q$ and the ratio $B_{\\theta}/B_{\\phi}$ in the large-aspect-ratio, circular-surface approximation, and then obtain a closed-form expression for $q(r)$ in terms of $r$, $a$, $R_{0}$, $B_{\\phi 0}$, $\\mu_{0}$, and $j_{0}$. State clearly any geometric approximations you invoke so that each step follows from fundamental definitions.\n\nProvide your final answer as a single analytic expression for $q(r)$.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided, and the assumptions are standard in the context of introductory tokamak theory. The problem is valid and can be solved by applying fundamental principles of magnetohydrodynamics and electromagnetism.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three main stages: first, establishing the relationship between the safety factor $q$ and the magnetic field components in the specified geometry; second, determining the poloidal magnetic field $B_{\\theta}(r)$ from the given current density profile using Ampère's law; and third, combining these results to find the final expression for $q(r)$.\n\nFirst, we begin with the definition of the safety factor $q$. A magnetic field line is defined by the differential equation $d\\vec{l} \\propto \\vec{B}$, where $d\\vec{l}$ is a differential element of length along the field line and $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field vector. In a toroidal coordinate system $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ representing the minor radius, poloidal angle, and toroidal angle, respectively, the components of a line element are $dr$, $r d\\theta$, and $R d\\phi$, where $R$ is the major radius coordinate. For a field $\\vec{B} = B_r \\hat{r} + B_\\theta \\hat{\\theta} + B_\\phi \\hat{\\phi}$, the field line equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{B_r} = \\frac{r d\\theta}{B_\\theta} = \\frac{R d\\phi}{B_\\phi}\n$$\nThe problem specifies concentric magnetic flux surfaces, which implies that the magnetic field lines are confined to these surfaces. This means there is no component of the magnetic field normal to the surfaces, so $B_r = 0$. The field line equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{r d\\theta}{B_\\theta} = \\frac{R d\\phi}{B_\\phi}\n$$\nRearranging this gives the local pitch of the field line, $\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\theta}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} = \\frac{r B_\\phi(r, \\theta)}{R(r, \\theta) B_\\theta(r, \\theta)}\n$$\nThe safety factor $q(r)$ is defined as the number of toroidal transits a field line makes for each poloidal transit. Mathematically, this is the average value of $\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\theta}$ over one poloidal circuit (from $\\theta=0$ to $\\theta=2\\pi$):\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{r B_\\phi(r, \\theta)}{R(r, \\theta) B_\\theta(r, \\theta)} d\\theta\n$$\nWe now apply the approximations for a large-aspect-ratio, circular-surface tokamak. The major radius is $R(r, \\theta) = R_0 + r \\cos\\theta$. In the large-aspect-ratio limit ($R_0 \\gg a$), we can approximate $R \\approx R_0$. The problem states that the toroidal field is approximately constant, $B_\\phi(r) \\approx B_{\\phi 0}$. For circular, concentric flux surfaces, the poloidal field $B_\\theta$ is a function of the minor radius $r$ only, $B_\\theta = B_\\theta(r)$. Substituting these approximations into the integral for $q(r)$:\n$$\nq(r) \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{r B_{\\phi 0}}{R_0 B_\\theta(r)} d\\theta\n$$\nSince the integrand is now independent of $\\theta$, the integration is trivial:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{r B_{\\phi 0}}{R_0 B_\\theta(r)} \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta = \\frac{r B_{\\phi 0}}{R_0 B_\\theta(r)}\n$$\nThis relation, $q(r) \\approx \\frac{r B_\\phi}{R_0 B_\\theta}$, is a standard result for large-aspect-ratio circular tokamaks.\n\nNext, we find the poloidal field $B_\\theta(r)$ using the integral form of Ampère's law, $\\oint_C \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{enc}$, where $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability. We choose the Amperian loop $C$ to be a circle of radius $r$ in the poloidal cross-section. Due to the specified axisymmetry and circular flux surfaces, $\\vec{B} = B_\\theta(r) \\hat{\\theta} + B_\\phi(r) \\hat{\\phi}$ and the line element is $d\\vec{l} = r d\\theta \\hat{\\theta}$. The left-hand side of Ampère's law becomes:\n$$\n\\oint_C \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} (B_\\theta(r) \\hat{\\theta}) \\cdot (r d\\theta \\hat{\\theta}) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} B_\\theta(r) r d\\theta = 2\\pi r B_\\theta(r)\n$$\nThe enclosed current, $I_{enc}$, is the total toroidal current passing through the circular area of radius $r$. We find this by integrating the toroidal current density $j_\\phi(r')$ over the area element $dA = 2\\pi r' dr'$ from $r'=0$ to $r'=r$:\n$$\nI_{enc}(r) = \\int_0^r j_\\phi(r') (2\\pi r') dr' = \\int_0^r j_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{r'^2}{a^2} \\right) 2\\pi r' dr'\n$$\n$$\nI_{enc}(r) = 2\\pi j_0 \\int_0^r \\left( r' - \\frac{r'^3}{a^2} \\right) dr' = 2\\pi j_0 \\left[ \\frac{r'^2}{2} - \\frac{r'^4}{4a^2} \\right]_0^r\n$$\n$$\nI_{enc}(r) = 2\\pi j_0 \\left( \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4a^2} \\right) = \\pi j_0 r^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into Ampère's law:\n$$\n2\\pi r B_\\theta(r) = \\mu_0 I_{enc}(r) = \\mu_0 \\pi j_0 r^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right)\n$$\nSolving for $B_\\theta(r)$:\n$$\nB_\\theta(r) = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\pi j_0 r^2}{2\\pi r} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\mu_0 j_0 r}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $B_\\theta(r)$ into our derived relation for $q(r)$:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{r B_{\\phi 0}}{R_0 B_\\theta(r)} = \\frac{r B_{\\phi 0}}{R_0 \\left[ \\frac{\\mu_0 j_0 r}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right) \\right]}\n$$\nCanceling the factor of $r$ from the numerator and denominator yields the final expression:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{B_{\\phi 0}}{R_0 \\frac{\\mu_0 j_0}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right)} = \\frac{2 B_{\\phi 0}}{\\mu_0 j_0 R_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right)}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the safety factor profile in terms of the given parameters.",

The Mercier criterion, safety factor, magnetic shear, and the large-aspect-ratio tokamak model are all fundamental and well-established concepts.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-defined. It asks for the derivation of a specific physical quantity (the Mercier index) under a standard set of approximations ($s$-$\\alpha$ model for a circular tokamak) and then for an algebraic manipulation to find a critical parameter. The objective is clear and a unique analytical solution exists within this framework.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of any subjective or non-scientific content.\n\nAll criteria for a valid problem are met. The problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe stability of a plasma against localized, pressure-driven interchange perturbations is determined by the sign of the change in potential energy, $\\delta W$, associated with a small displacement of the plasma. The Mercier criterion is a condition derived from the ideal MHD energy principle, $\\delta W  0$, for stability against modes that are highly localized around a rational magnetic surface where the safety factor $q(r)$ is a rational number.\n\nFor a large–aspect–ratio ($r/R_0 \\ll 1$), circular cross-section tokamak, and within the $s$-$\\alpha$ ordering framework, the analysis of the energy principle for flute-like perturbations ($\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\approx 0$) results in a stability criterion that balances two primary physical effects:\n1.  **Magnetic Shear Stabilization**: Perturbations that try to interchange flux tubes must bend the magnetic field lines. This field line bending requires energy and is a stabilizing effect. In the specified limit, this contribution is proportional to the square of the magnetic shear, $s(r)^2$.\n2.  **Pressure-Curvature Drive**: The plasma pressure gradient, $\\frac{dp}{dr}$, acts as a source of free energy. This energy can be released if plasma is displaced into a region of weaker magnetic field. In a simple torus, the magnetic field is weaker on the outboard side ($RR_0$) where the field lines have \"bad\" curvature (convex, pointing away from the plasma center). This interaction provides a destabilizing drive for interchange modes. For a flute-like mode in the $s$-$\\alpha$ limit, the dominant drive is due to the average unfavorable curvature, and this drive is enhanced by a factor of $q(r)^2$, which relates to the connection length between good and bad curvature regions along a field line.\n\nCombining these two leading-order effects, the Mercier stability index, $D_M(r)$, which represents the net energy balance and must be positive for stability ($D_M(r)  0$), is given by:\n$$\nD_M(r) = \\frac{s(r)^2}{4} + \\frac{2\\mu_0 q(r)^2 R_0}{B_0^2} \\frac{dp}{dr}\n$$\nHere, the first term $\\frac{s(r)^2}{4}$ is the stabilizing shear term. The second term contains the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dr}$, which is negative for a confined plasma. Thus, the second term as a whole is negative and represents the destabilizing pressure-curvature drive. This expression for $D_M(r)$ is in terms of the requested variables: $s(r)$, $\\frac{dp}{dr}$, $q(r)$, $B_0$, $R_0$, and $\\mu_0$.\n\nTo find the critical pressure gradient, $dp_{\\mathrm{crit}}/dr$, we impose the marginality condition, $D_M(r) = 0$. This condition defines the boundary between stability and instability.\n$$\n\\frac{s(r)^2}{4} + \\frac{2\\mu_0 q(r)^2 R_0}{B_0^2} \\frac{dp_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{dr} = 0\n$$\nWe now solve this equation for $\\frac{dp_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{dr}$:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\mu_0 q(r)^2 R_0}{B_0^2} \\frac{dp_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{dr} = -\\frac{s(r)^2}{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{dr} = -\\frac{s(r)^2}{4} \\left( \\frac{B_0^2}{2\\mu_0 q(r)^2 R_0} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{dr} = -\\frac{s(r)^2 B_0^2}{8\\mu_0 q(r)^2 R_0}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final expression to be in terms of $R_{0}$, $B_{0}$, $\\mu_{0}$, $q(r)$, $\\frac{dq}{dr}$, and $r$.

We can combine the given definitions for the ion thermal speed $v_{\\mathrm{thi}} = \\sqrt{2 T_{i}/m_{i}}$ and the ion cyclotron frequency $\\Omega_{ci} = e B_{0}/m_{i}$ into a single expression for $\\rho_i$:\n$$\\rho_i = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{thi}}}{\\Omega_{ci}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 T_{i}/m_{i}}}{e B_{0}/m_{i}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 T_{i} m_{i}}}{e B_{0}}$$\nBefore substituting values, the ion temperature must be converted from kiloelectron-volts ($\\mathrm{keV}$) to Joules ($\\mathrm{J}$):\n$$T_i = 8.0\\ \\mathrm{keV} = 8.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{eV} = (8.0 \\times 10^{3}) \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{eV}) = 1.2816 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{J}$$\nNow, we substitute all values into the expression for $\\rho_i$:\n$$m_i = 3.345 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$$\n$$e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$$\n$$B_0 = 5.3\\ \\mathrm{T}$$\n$$\\rho_i = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 \\times (1.2816 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{J}) \\times (3.345 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg})}}{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}) \\times (5.3\\ \\mathrm{T})}$$\n$$\\rho_i = \\frac{\\sqrt{8.573952 \\times 10^{-42}\\ \\mathrm{kg}^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}^2}}{8.4906 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\mathrm{T}}$$\n$$\\rho_i = \\frac{2.92813 \\times 10^{-21}\\ \\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}}{8.4906 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{s}} \\approx 0.0034487\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\n**4. Evaluate the Dimensionless Product $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i}$**\nFinally, we compute the product of $k_{\\perp}$ and $\\rho_i$:\n$$k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i} = (4.7539\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\times (0.0034487\\ \\mathrm{m})$$\n$$k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i} \\approx 0.016396$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $0.0164$.\n\n**Contextual Justification for Finite Larmor Radius (FLR) Effects**\nThe calculated value is $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i} \\approx 0.0164$. This parameter quantifies the ratio of the ion gyroradius to the perpendicular wavelength of the mode. Since $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i} \\ll 1$, the spatial scale of the instability is much larger than the ion gyroradius. In this regime, an ideal MHD description, which formally assumes $\\rho_{i} \\to 0$, provides a good leading-order approximation of the mode's structure and stability. Finite Larmor Radius (FLR) effects, such as ion diamagnetic drifts, would introduce small corrections to the mode's real frequency and growth rate and are not expected to be dominant. Therefore, the use of ideal MHD as a starting point is justified, and FLR corrections are not strictly necessary for a lowest-order estimate.",
