The setup is a standard, albeit simplified, model used in the field. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and assumptions to derive a unique solution without contradictions. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Resistive Magnetic Diffusion Equation**\n\nWe start with Maxwell-Faraday's law:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThe problem states that flow is negligible, so the electromotive force $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ is absent. The provided form of Ohm's law is $\\mathbf{E} = \\eta \\mathbf{J}$. Substituting this into Faraday's law yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\times (\\eta \\mathbf{J})\n$$\nSince the resistivity $\\eta$ is assumed to be uniform, it can be taken out of the curl operator:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\eta (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J})\n$$\nNext, we use Ampère's law (neglecting the displacement current, which is an excellent approximation for the slow phenomena considered), $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_{0} \\mathbf{J}$, to eliminate the current density $\\mathbf{J}$. Rearranging for $\\mathbf{J}$ gives $\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\eta \\left( \\nabla \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nThe magnetic permeability of free space $\\mu_{0}$ is a constant, so it can also be moved outside the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0}} \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nWe now employ the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{A}$. Applying this identity to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nFrom Gauss's law for magnetism, we have $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. This simplifies the vector identity to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the evolving equation for $\\mathbf{B}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0}} (-\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}) = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0}} \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis is the general resistive magnetic diffusion equation. The problem specifies a one-dimensional treatment across the tearing layer using the coordinate $x$, which implies that spatial variations are dominated by the derivative in the $x$ direction. Thus, the Laplacian operator simplifies to $\\nabla^2 \\approx \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0}} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a classical diffusion equation, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$. By comparison, we identify the resistive diffusion coefficient, often denoted $D_m$ or $D_R$, as:\n$$\nD_m = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0}}\n$$\n\n**Critical Frequency for Field Penetration**\n\nThe derived equation describes how the magnetic field evolves due to resistive diffusion. To determine the condition for an external field to penetrate the layer, we use a timescale argument. The characteristic time $\\tau_R$ for the magnetic field to diffuse across a region of thickness $\\delta$ is given by the dimensional scaling of the diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\tau_R \\sim \\frac{(\\text{length scale})^2}{\\text{diffusion coefficient}} = \\frac{\\delta^2}{D_m} = \\frac{\\mu_{0} \\delta^2}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis is the resistive diffusion time. The externally applied magnetic perturbation is harmonic with an angular frequency $\\omega$. The characteristic timescale of this perturbation is $\\tau_{pert} = 1/\\omega$.\n\nFor the magnetic field to penetrate the resistive layer, the perturbation must persist for a time longer than or comparable to the time it takes for the field to diffuse through the layer. If the perturbation changes too rapidly (i.e., $\\tau_{pert} \\ll \\tau_R$), the plasma inside the layer behaves as a near-perfect conductor, and induced currents will flow to shield the external field, preventing its penetration (a phenomenon analogous to the skin effect). Conversely, if the perturbation varies slowly ($\\tau_{pert} \\gtrsim \\tau_R$), there is sufficient time for the field to \"leak\" or diffuse through the resistive plasma.\n\nTherefore, the condition for resistive field penetration is:\n$$\n\\tau_{pert} \\gtrsim \\tau_R \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\gtrsim \\frac{\\mu_{0} \\delta^2}{\\eta}\n$$\nRearranging this inequality to solve for $\\omega$, we find:\n$$\n\\omega \\lesssim \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0} \\delta^2}\n$$\nThe problem statement defines a critical angular frequency $\\omega_c$ such that penetration occurs for $\\omega  \\omega_c$. Based on the derived condition, this critical frequency is the inverse of the resistive diffusion time. The analytic expression for $\\omega_c$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{\\tau_R} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0} \\delta^2}\n$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation of the Critical Frequency**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\eta = 3 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\delta = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 3 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H/m}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the expression for $\\omega_c$:\n$$\n\\omega_c = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-6}}{ (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (3 \\times 10^{-3})^2 }\n$$\nFirst, calculate the square of the layer width:\n$$\n\\delta^2 = (3 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 = 9 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\n$$\nNow, substitute this into the denominator:\n$$\n\\mu_{0} \\delta^2 = (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H/m}) \\times (9 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) = 36\\pi \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{H}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nFinally, compute the value of $\\omega_c$:\n$$\n\\omega_c = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}}{36\\pi \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{H}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{3}{36\\pi} \\times 10^{-6 - (-13)}\\,\\frac{\\Omega}{\\mathrm{H}}\n$$\nThe units are $\\Omega / \\mathrm{H} = \\Omega / (\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{s}) = 1/\\mathrm{s}$, which corresponds to radians per second, as expected for an angular frequency.\n$$\n\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{12\\pi} \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nTo obtain the numerical value:\n$$\n\\omega_c \\approx \\frac{1}{12 \\times 3.14159} \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx \\frac{1}{37.6991} \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_c \\approx 0.0265258 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 265258\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\omega_c \\approx 2.65 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$",

The Rutherford model for nonlinear tearing mode evolution is a canonical result in this field. The governing equations are fundamental laws of electromagnetism and plasma physics.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It requests the justification of a standard theoretical result and a subsequent numerical calculation for which all necessary data and a clear functional form are provided. A unique numerical answer exists.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard scientific terminology. There are no subjective or opinion-based components.\n4.  **Consistency and Completeness**: The problem is self-contained. The provided units for the constants and variables are dimensionally consistent. Let's verify the units for the expression $\\frac{dw}{dt} = C \\eta \\Delta'$:\n    - Units of $C$: $[\\mathrm{m}/(\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{s})]$\n    - Units of $\\eta$: $[\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}]$\n    - Units of $\\Delta'$: $[\\mathrm{m}^{-1}]$\n    - Units of $C \\eta \\Delta'$: $[\\mathrm{m}/(\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{s})] \\times [\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}] \\times [\\mathrm{m}^{-1}] = [\\mathrm{m/s}]$.\n    This matches the units of $\\frac{dw}{dt}$. The problem is dimensionally consistent. The proposed form implicitly embeds the vacuum permeability $\\mu_0$ within the constant $C$, as the standard Rutherford equation is $\\frac{dw}{dt} \\propto \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\Delta'$. The units of $\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0}$ are $[\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}]$, so $\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0}\\Delta'$ has units of $[\\mathrm{m/s}]$.

The numerical values are physically plausible for a tokamak plasma edge or a relatively cool plasma core.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid, scientifically sound, and self-consistent. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem asks first to show that the island evolution rate $\\frac{dw}{dt}$ is proportional to the product of resistivity $\\eta$ and the tearing stability parameter $\\Delta'$. This is the central result of the Rutherford theory of nonlinear tearing modes. We outline the key steps of this derivation.\n\nThe analysis is split into two regions: an \"outer\" region, where ideal MHD holds ($\\eta=0$), and a thin \"inner\" resistive layer around the rational surface (let's say at $x=0$) where flux reconnection occurs.\n\n1.  **Outer Region**: Away from $x=0$, the plasma is governed by ideal MHD. The perturbed magnetic flux, $\\psi_1$, associated with the tearing mode satisfies the equation $\\nabla^2 \\psi_1 = 0$ (in the force-free approximation). The solution to this equation in the outer regions ($x \\gg 0$ and $x \\ll 0$) provides the tearing stability parameter $\\Delta'$, which is defined as the discontinuity in the logarithmic derivative of $\\psi_1$ across the inner layer:\n    $$ \\Delta' = \\frac{1}{\\psi_1(0)} \\left( \\left. \\frac{d\\psi_1}{dx} \\right|_{x\\to 0^+} - \\left. \\frac{d\\psi_1}{dx} \\right|_{x\\to 0^-} \\right) $$\n    $\\Delta'$ represents the free energy stored in the equilibrium magnetic field gradient that can be released by the tearing instability.\n\n2.  **Inner Region**: Within the resistive layer of width $\\sim w$, resistivity cannot be neglected. We integrate the parallel component of Ampère's Law, which in slab geometry is $\\frac{d^2\\psi_1}{dx^2} = -\\mu_0 J_z$, across the inner layer from $-x_L$ to $+x_L$ (where $x_L$ is a point just outside the resistive layer but still in the \"inner\" part of the overall asymptotic matching problem):\n    $$ \\int_{-x_L}^{x_L} \\frac{d^2\\psi_1}{dx^2} dx = \\left[ \\frac{d\\psi_1}{dx} \\right]_{-x_L}^{x_L} = -\\mu_0 \\int_{-x_L}^{x_L} J_z dx $$\n    Matching this with the outer solution gives:\n    $$ \\Delta' \\psi_1(0) \\approx -\\mu_0 \\int_{-w}^{w} J_z dx $$\n    where the integral is approximated over the island width $w$.\n\n3.  **Relating Current and Flux Evolution**: We use Faraday's law and Ohm's law. In the rest frame of the island and for slow evolution, the parallel component of Faraday's Law gives the parallel electric field $E_z = -\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t}$. The parallel Ohm's law is $E_z = \\eta J_z$. Combining them yields an expression for the parallel current density:\n    $$ J_z = -\\frac{1}{\\eta} \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} $$\n    In the nonlinear phase, the current perturbation $J_z$ is flattened inside the magnetic island. The total flux $\\psi$ evolves slowly in time.\n\n4.  **Combining and Deriving the Evolution Law**: Substituting the expression for $J_z$ into the integrated Ampère's law:\n    $$ \\Delta' \\psi_1(0) = -\\mu_0 \\int_{-w}^{w} \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\eta} \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} \\right) dx = \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\eta} \\int_{-w}^{w} \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} dx $$\n    The \"constant-$\\psi$\" (more accurately, constant helical flux $\\Psi$) approximation implies that the primary spatial variation of the flux perturbation is captured by the island structure. The time derivative is dominated by the growth of the reconnected flux amplitude, $\\frac{d\\psi_1}{dt}$. The integral $\\int_{-w}^{w} \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} dx$ can be shown to be proportional to $w \\frac{d\\psi_1}{dt}$. Let's denote this as $\\int \\sim I_1 w \\frac{d\\psi_1}{dt}$, where $I_1$ is a dimensionless constant of order unity.\n    $$ \\Delta' \\psi_1(0) \\propto \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\eta} w \\frac{d\\psi_1}{dt} $$\n    The island half-width $w$ is related to the reconnected flux amplitude $\\psi_1$ by $w \\propto \\sqrt{\\psi_1}$, or $\\psi_1 \\propto w^2$. Differentiating with respect to time gives $\\frac{d\\psi_1}{dt} \\propto 2w \\frac{dw}{dt}$. Substituting these relations for $\\psi_1$ and $\\frac{d\\psi_1}{dt}$:\n    $$ \\Delta' (k_1 w^2) \\propto \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\eta} w (k_2 w \\frac{dw}{dt}) $$\n    where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are proportionality constants. Simplifying this expression:\n    $$ \\Delta' w^2 \\propto \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\eta} w^2 \\frac{dw}{dt} $$\n    $$ \\Delta' \\propto \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\eta} \\frac{dw}{dt} $$\n    Rearranging for the island evolution rate gives the celebrated Rutherford result:\n    $$ \\frac{dw}{dt} \\propto \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\Delta' $$\n    This shows that $\\frac{dw}{dt}$ is proportional to both $\\eta$ and $\\Delta'$. The problem statement provides the form $\\frac{dw}{dt} = C \\eta \\Delta'$, where the constant $C$ absorbs the factor of $1/\\mu_0$ and all other geometric and numerical constants of order unity that arise from the full integration.

Since the calculated value is negative:\n$$ \\frac{dw}{dt}  0 $$\nthis indicates that the island half-width $w$ is decreasing over time. Therefore, the island shrinks. This is physically consistent with the fact that the tearing stability parameter $\\Delta'$ is negative. A negative $\\Delta'$ corresponds to a classically stable tearing mode, which will decay due to resistivity unless another drive mechanism (e.g., neoclassical effects, error fields) is present. In this purely resistive model, a negative $\\Delta'$ must lead to decay.",

The concepts invoked, such as the Rutherford equation, magnetic islands, tearing stability index ($\\Delta'$), and ECCD, are scientifically grounded and form the basis of modern MHD stability control.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the well-established Rutherford model for magnetic island evolution, a cornerstone of resistive MHD theory. The values are physically plausible for a medium-sized tokamak.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined with an initial state, a target state, and a specified linear relationship between the control parameter ($I_d$) and the system's response (change in $w$). It asks for a unique value, which can be determined from the given information.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free of ambiguity or subjectivity.\n- **Completeness**: The problem provides all necessary information. The key is the explicit definition of the coefficient $S$, which quantifies the linear relationship, making it unnecessary to use the full, detailed form of the Rutherford equation. The assumption of linearity, while an approximation, is explicitly given as a premise for the problem.\n- **Consistency**: The givens are self-consistent.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe evolution of the magnetic island half-width, $w$, is described by the Rutherford equation. In a steady state, the island width is constant, which means its time derivative is zero: $\\frac{dw}{dt} = 0$. This implies that the net sum of all driving and stabilizing terms in the Rutherford equation is zero.\n\nLet $\\Delta'_{\\text{net}}(w)$ represent the sum of all intrinsic stability terms (e.g., classical $\\Delta'$, bootstrap current term). Without external current drive, the island saturates at a width $w_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ where these terms balance.\n$$\n\\Delta'_{\\text{net}}(w_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = 0\n$$\nWhen an external current $I_d$ is applied via ECCD, it introduces an additional stabilizing term, $\\Delta'_{\\text{ECCD}}(w, I_d)$. The new steady-state is achieved at a width $w_f$ where the total sum is zero.\n$$\n\\Delta'_{\\text{net}}(w_f) + \\Delta'_{\\text{ECCD}}(w_f, I_d) = 0\n$$\nThe problem states that for a small perturbation around $w_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, the response is linear. This is equivalent to linearizing the steady-state equation. However, the problem simplifies the task by providing a direct, operationally-defined linear relationship through the coefficient $S$.\n\nThe proportional stabilization coefficient, $S$, is defined as the driven current required per unit reduction in the steady-state width. Let $w_i$ be the initial steady-state width and $w_f$ be the final steady-state width. The reduction in width is $\\Delta w = w_i - w_f$.\n\nAccording to the definition provided:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\text{driven current}}{\\text{reduction in width}} = \\frac{I_d}{\\Delta w}\n$$\nSo, the relationship is:\n$$\nS = \\frac{I_d}{w_i - w_f}\n$$\nThe problem requires deriving the relation for the driven current $I_d$ and then computing its value. We can rearrange the equation above to solve for $I_d$:\n$$\nI_d = S \\times (w_i - w_f)\n$$\nThis is the derived relation between the driven current and the reduction in the island's steady-state half-width.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into this equation.\nThe initial half-width is the saturated width in the absence of external drive:\n$w_i = w_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\nThe target half-width is:\n$w_f = 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\nThe stabilization coefficient is:\n$S = 50\\,\\mathrm{A/cm}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the required reduction in width, $\\Delta w$:\n$$\n\\Delta w = w_i - w_f = 5\\,\\mathrm{cm} - 2\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 3\\,\\mathrm{cm}\n$$\nNext, we use the derived relation to compute the required driven current, $I_d$:\n$$\nI_d = S \\times \\Delta w = (50\\,\\mathrm{A/cm}) \\times (3\\,\\mathrm{cm})\n$$\nThe units of centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}$) cancel, yielding the current in amperes ($\\mathrm{A}$).\n$$\nI_d = 150\\,\\mathrm{A}\n$$\nThus, a driven current of $150\\,\\mathrm{A}$ is required to reduce the steady-state island half-width from $5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ to $2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, under the given linear response model.",
