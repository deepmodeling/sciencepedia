The energy principle states that ideal MHD stability is determined by the sign of the perturbed potential energy $\\delta W$, which can be represented as the sum of positive-definite field-line bending terms and pressure-gradient–curvature coupling terms. In a local analysis, the stabilizing contribution scales with the square of the parallel wavenumber $k_{\\parallel}$ through the field-line bending energy, while the destabilizing contribution scales with the product of the equilibrium pressure gradient $p' \\equiv \\mathrm{d}p/\\mathrm{d}r$ and the equilibrium magnetic field-line curvature $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\equiv \\hat{\\boldsymbol{b}} \\cdot \\nabla \\hat{\\boldsymbol{b}}$ (where $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{b}} = \\boldsymbol{B}/B$). Magnetic shear $s$ modifies $k_{\\parallel}$ locally for interchange-like perturbations.\n\nYou are asked to carry out the following thought experiment and then select the most accurate explanation of the outcome using the local stability content of the Mercier and Suydam criteria.\n\nThought experiment:\n- Configuration $\\mathsf{C}$ (cylinder): A straight cylindrical plasma of minor radius $a$ with a helical magnetic field whose pitch varies with radius, so the local magnetic shear $s$ is finite and can be externally increased. The axial magnetic field is $B_{z}$, and the local pressure gradient $p'(r)$ is negative and of fixed magnitude at the evaluation radius $r_{0}$. There is no toroidal curvature, so the dominant equilibrium curvature component associated with bending around a major radius is absent, i.e., $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{tor}} \\approx 0$. Assume the local total magnetic field magnitude $B$ and $p'(r_{0})$ can be matched to those of the toroidal case below.\n- Configuration $\\mathsf{T}$ (torus): A toroidal plasma (e.g., a generic tokamak-like torus) of major radius $R$ and the same minor radius $a$ has the same local $B$ and $p'(r_{0})$ at the outboard midplane as configuration $\\mathsf{C}$, and the local magnetic shear $s$ can likewise be increased. However, the field lines possess unfavorable (bad) curvature at the outboard midplane with magnitude $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{bad}} \\sim 1/R$ pointing radially outward. The local perturbations are evaluated at the outboard midplane, where interchange-like modes typically sample the largest unfavorable curvature.\n\nSuppose that in both configurations the magnetic shear $s$ is increased by a factor of $2$, holding $B$ and $p'(r_{0})$ fixed. Based on the ideal MHD energy principle and the local structure of the Mercier and Suydam criteria, which statement best explains why the shear increase stabilizes configuration $\\mathsf{C}$ but can fail to stabilize configuration $\\mathsf{T}$?\n\nA. In both $\\mathsf{C}$ and $\\mathsf{T}$, increasing magnetic shear $s$ guarantees local interchange stability because the pressure–curvature coupling term is identically zero in ideal MHD; hence curvature is irrelevant when $s$ is finite.\n\nB. In $\\mathsf{C}$, the absence of toroidal curvature ($\\kappa_{\\mathrm{tor}} \\approx 0$) removes the pressure–curvature drive, so increasing $s$ raises the field-line bending energy via $k_{\\parallel}(s)$ and enforces the local Suydam-type stability condition. In $\\mathsf{T}$ at the outboard midplane, the unfavorable curvature ($\\kappa_{\\mathrm{bad}} \\sim 1/R$) yields a negative pressure–curvature term that can overwhelm the added shear–bending stabilization, rendering the local Mercier index negative so the configuration remains locally unstable despite the increased $s$.\n\nC. Configuration $\\mathsf{T}$ fails to stabilize with increasing $s$ because shear reduces the parallel wavenumber $k_{\\parallel}$, thereby lowering the line-bending energy, whereas $\\mathsf{C}$ stabilizes because its pressure gradient $p'(r_{0})$ vanishes; thus only $\\mathsf{T}$ suffers from pressure-driven instability.\n\nD. Both configurations remain unstable because magnetic shear $s$ does not enter the ideal MHD energy principle; only resistive effects can stabilize interchange modes, so increasing $s$ has no ideal impact.\n\nE. The discrepancy arises because the torus has larger magnetic field $B$ than the cylinder, making the line-bending term weaker in $\\mathsf{T}$; with the same $p'(r_{0})$, more shear is required for $\\mathsf{T}$, so doubling $s$ is insufficient while it is sufficient for $\\mathsf{C}$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The thought experiment is a standard pedagogical tool for contrasting local stability in cylindrical and toroidal geometries.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the local stability of a plasma to interchange-like perturbations, as described by the ideal MHD energy principle. The stability is determined by the sign of the perturbed potential energy, $\\delta W$. For a mode to be unstable, $\\delta W$ must be negative. A simplified, generic form for $\\delta W$ for localized modes can be expressed as an integral over a small radial layer:\n$$ \\delta W \\propto \\int \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} k_{\\parallel}^2 B^2 |\\xi_r|^2 - 2 p' \\kappa_n |\\xi_r|^2 \\right] dr $$\nHere, $\\xi_r$ is the radial component of the plasma displacement, $k_{\\parallel}$ is the component of the wavevector parallel to the magnetic field $\\boldsymbol{B}$, $p' \\equiv dp/dr$ is the radial pressure gradient, and $\\kappa_n$ is the component of the magnetic curvature normal to the flux surface and pointing radially outward.\n\nThe first term, proportional to $k_{\\parallel}^2$, represents the energy required to bend magnetic field lines. This term is always non-negative and thus stabilizing.\nThe second term, proportional to $-p' \\kappa_n$, represents the drive for instability from the plasma pressure gradient interacting with field line curvature. For a confined plasma, the pressure decreases outwards, so $p'  0$. If the curvature is \"unfavorable\" or \"bad\" (i.e., the field lines are concave towards the plasma, so $\\kappa_n  0$), then the product $-p' \\kappa_n$ is negative, providing a destabilizing drive. If the curvature is \"favorable\" or \"good\" ($\\kappa_n  0$), this term is stabilizing.\n\nMagnetic shear, $s$, plays a crucial role in the stabilizing line-bending term. Interchange-like perturbations are most dangerous near \"rational\" magnetic surfaces where the field lines close on themselves after a finite number of transits. On such a surface, a perturbation can be constructed such that $k_{\\parallel} \\approx 0$, seemingly neutralizing the stabilizing line-bending term. However, finite magnetic shear means that the pitch of the magnetic field lines changes with radius. Consequently, a perturbation that is radially localized but has finite extent will experience a non-zero $k_{\\parallel}$ as it moves away from the central rational surface. The effective parallel wavenumber for a mode localized at $x = r - r_0$ from a rational surface at $r_0$ is approximately $k_{\\parallel} \\propto s \\cdot x$. When integrated over the radial extent of the mode, this leads to a net stabilizing contribution that scales as $s^2$.\n\nNow, let us analyze the two configurations in the thought experiment.\n\n**Configuration $\\mathsf{C}$ (Cylinder):**\nThis is a straight cylinder with a helical magnetic field. The problem states that there is no toroidal curvature, so $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{tor}} \\approx 0$. In such a system, the only curvature arises from the helical structure of the magnetic field itself. This curvature is typically small and, for standard profiles, is \"favorable\" ($\\kappa_n \\le 0$). Thus, the primary destabilizing drive associated with bad curvature is absent. The local stability is governed by the Suydam criterion, which for $p'0$ represents a balance between the destabilizing pressure gradient and the stabilizing effect of magnetic shear. The criterion can be schematically written as:\n$$ D_S = \\frac{s^2}{4} + \\dots \\text{(favorable curvature terms)}  0 $$\nSince the pressure gradient $p'(r_0)$ is finite and negative, a sufficiently low shear $s$ could lead to instability ($D_S  0$). However, because the stabilizing term scales as $s^2$, increasing the shear is a powerful stabilizing mechanism. Increasing $s$ by a factor of $2$ increases this stabilizing term by a factor of $4$. In the absence of a strong, unfavorable curvature drive, this increase is very effective and can be expected to stabilize the configuration.\n\n**Configuration $\\mathsf{T}$ (Torus):**\nThis is a toroidal plasma. The key difference from the cylinder is the presence of significant geometrical curvature due to the toroidal shape. On the outboard side of the torus (large major radius $R$), the magnetic field lines are bent around the major axis, creating a region of \"unfavorable\" or \"bad\" curvature with $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{bad}} \\sim 1/R  0$. At the outboard midplane, where perturbations are evaluated, this bad curvature couples with the negative pressure gradient ($p'0$) to produce a strong destabilizing term $-p' \\kappa_{\\mathrm{bad}}  0$ in $\\delta W$. The local stability in this case is governed by the Mercier criterion, which can be schematically written as:\n$$ D_M = \\frac{s^2}{4} - C p'  0 $$\nwhere the term $C$ is positive and large in the region of unfavorable curvature. This term represents a strong, persistent destabilizing drive. While increasing shear $s$ by a factor of $2$ still enhances the stabilizing term by a factor of $4$, it may be insufficient to overcome the large, negative, pressure-driven term. If the initial configuration is deeply unstable due to the large $-C p'$ term, it is entirely possible that even with the increased shear, the Mercier index remains negative ($D_M  0$), and the configuration remains locally unstable.\n\n**Conclusion of the Thought Experiment:**\nThe fundamental difference is the presence of a strong, unfavorable curvature drive in the torus ($\\mathsf{T}$) which is absent in the cylinder ($\\mathsf{C}$). Stabilizing $\\mathsf{C}$ only requires shear to overcome a relatively weak instability drive. Stabilizing $\\mathsf{T}$ requires shear to overcome a much stronger drive rooted in the toroidal geometry itself. Therefore, a given increase in shear can stabilize $\\mathsf{C}$ but fail to stabilize $\\mathsf{T}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. In both $\\mathsf{C}$ and $\\mathsf{T}$, increasing magnetic shear $s$ guarantees local interchange stability because the pressure–curvature coupling term is identically zero in ideal MHD; hence curvature is irrelevant when $s$ is finite.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The pressure-gradient–curvature coupling term is the primary driver of interchange and ballooning instabilities and is a central component of the ideal MHD energy principle. It is not identically zero. **Incorrect.**\n\n**B. In $\\mathsf{C}$, the absence of toroidal curvature ($\\kappa_{\\mathrm{tor}} \\approx 0$) removes the pressure–curvature drive, so increasing $s$ raises the field-line bending energy via $k_{\\parallel}(s)$ and enforces the local Suydam-type stability condition. In $\\mathsf{T}$ at the outboard midplane, the unfavorable curvature ($\\kappa_{\\mathrm{bad}} \\sim 1/R$) yields a negative pressure–curvature term that can overwhelm the added shear–bending stabilization, rendering the local Mercier index negative so the configuration remains locally unstable despite the increased $s$.**\nThis statement accurately captures the physics derived above. It correctly identifies the absence of the main destabilizing drive in $\\mathsf{C}$, making it responsive to shear stabilization. It also correctly identifies the strong, unfavorable curvature drive in $\\mathsf{T}$ as the reason why the same increase in shear may be insufficient for stabilization. The reference to the Suydam condition for $\\mathsf{C}$ and the Mercier index for $\\mathsf{T}$ is appropriate. **Correct.**\n\n**C. Configuration $\\mathsf{T}$ fails to stabilize with increasing $s$ because shear reduces the parallel wavenumber $k_{\\parallel}$, thereby lowering the line-bending energy, whereas $\\mathsf{C}$ stabilizes because its pressure gradient $p'(r_{0})$ vanishes; thus only $\\mathsf{T}$ suffers from pressure-driven instability.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, magnetic shear $s$ *increases* the effective parallel wavenumber $k_{\\parallel}$ for modes away from a rational surface, which *enhances* line-bending energy, providing stabilization. Second, the problem explicitly states that $p'(r_0)$ is negative and of fixed magnitude in *both* configurations, not that it vanishes in $\\mathsf{C}$. **Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both configurations remain unstable because magnetic shear $s$ does not enter the ideal MHD energy principle; only resistive effects can stabilize interchange modes, so increasing $s$ has no ideal impact.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Magnetic shear $s$ is a critical stabilizing term in the ideal MHD energy principle for localized modes, as captured by the $s^2$ term in both the Suydam and Mercier criteria. While resistive MHD introduces different physics (e.g., resistive interchange modes), shear is a dominant factor in ideal MHD stability. **Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The discrepancy arises because the torus has larger magnetic field $B$ than the cylinder, making the line-bending term weaker in $\\mathsf{T}$; with the same $p'(r_{0})$, more shear is required for $\\mathsf{T}$, so doubling $s$ is insufficient while it is sufficient for $\\mathsf{C}$.**\nThis statement contradicts the problem's premise. The problem explicitly states that configuration $\\mathsf{T}$ has \"the same local $B$ and $p'(r_{0})$ at the outboard midplane as configuration $\\mathsf{C}$\". Therefore, the premise that the magnetic field is different is false. Furthermore, a larger magnetic field $B$ would make the line-bending term ($ \\propto s^2 B^2$) stronger, not weaker. **Incorrect.**",

The turning points are then $s_{1} = -A$ and $s_{2} = A$.\n\nThe quantization integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{-A}^{A} \\sqrt{\\kappa \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{0} + D_{M}}{\\kappa} - s^{2}\\right)} \\, ds = \\int_{-A}^{A} \\sqrt{\\kappa (A^{2} - s^{2})} \\, ds = \\sqrt{\\kappa} \\int_{-A}^{A} \\sqrt{A^{2} - s^{2}} \\, ds\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{-A}^{A} \\sqrt{A^{2} - s^{2}} \\, ds$ represents the area of a semicircle of radius $A$, which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi A^{2}$. We can also compute this formally using a trigonometric substitution. Let $s = A \\sin\\theta$, so $ds = A \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta$. The limits of integration change from $s \\in [-A, A]$ to $\\theta \\in [-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{-A}^{A} \\sqrt{A^{2} - s^{2}} \\, ds = \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\sqrt{A^{2} - A^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta} \\, (A \\cos\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\\\\n= \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\sqrt{A^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta} \\, (A \\cos\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\\\\n= A^{2} \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\cos^{2}\\theta \\, d\\theta \\\\\n= A^{2} \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1 + \\cos(2\\theta)}{2} \\, d\\theta \\\\\n= A^{2} \\left[ \\frac{\\theta}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{4} \\right]_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\\\\n= A^{2} \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} + 0\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4} + 0\\right) \\right) = \\frac{\\pi A^{2}}{2}\n\\end{align*}\nSubstituting this result back into the quantization condition:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\kappa} \\left(\\frac{\\pi A^{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\kappa} A^{2} = 1\n$$\nNow, we substitute back the definition of $A^{2}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\kappa} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{0} + D_{M}}{\\kappa}\\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_{0} + D_{M}}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} = 1\n$$\nSolving for the lowest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{0}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{0} + D_{M} = \\sqrt{\\kappa}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{0} = \\sqrt{\\kappa} - D_{M}\n$$\nThis is the leading-order WKB estimate for the lowest eigenvalue. It is noteworthy that for the harmonic oscillator potential, the WKB approximation yields the exact ground state eigenvalue.\n\nThe problem also asks to state how the sign of $\\lambda_{0}$ depends on $D_{M}$. The eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is proportional to the minimum of the ideal MHD potential energy variation $\\delta W$. Stability of the plasma against this interchange-type perturbation requires $\\delta W  0$, which corresponds to $\\lambda  0$.\nBased on our result, $\\lambda_{0} = \\sqrt{\\kappa} - D_{M}$:\n- If $D_{M}  \\sqrt{\\kappa}$, then $\\lambda_{0}  0$, and the mode is stable.\n- If $D_{M}  \\sqrt{\\kappa}$, then $\\lambda_{0}  0$, and the mode is unstable. The eigenvalue $\\lambda_{0}$ becomes negative, corresponding to an exponentially growing perturbation.\n- If $D_{M} = \\sqrt{\\kappa}$, then $\\lambda_{0} = 0$, which defines the marginal stability boundary.\n\nThe sign of $\\lambda_{0}$ is positive when the Mercier drive $D_{M}$ is less than the stabilizing field-line bending term $\\sqrt{\\kappa}$, and negative when the destabilizing Mercier drive exceeds this threshold.",
