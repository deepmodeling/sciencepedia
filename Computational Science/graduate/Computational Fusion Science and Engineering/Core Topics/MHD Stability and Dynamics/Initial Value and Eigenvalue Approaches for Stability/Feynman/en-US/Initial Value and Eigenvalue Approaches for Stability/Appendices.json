            "problem": "A magnetically confined plasma equilibrium is linearized for stability analysis using either Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) or gyrokinetics. In both cases, the linearized dynamics can be expressed in the abstract operator form $ \\partial_t u = \\mathcal{L} u $ (first-order in time, e.g., for gyrokinetic perturbations) or $ \\partial_t^2 \\xi = \\mathcal{F} \\xi $ (second-order in time, e.g., for MHD displacement). Let $ \\{ \\phi_i \\}_{i=1}^n $ be a finite set of basis functions for a Galerkin discretization over the domain, with a physically motivated inner product defining a mass-like matrix through $ \\langle \\phi_i, \\phi_j \\rangle = B_{ij} $. The weak form projection of the linearized operators $ \\mathcal{L} $ and $ \\mathcal{F} $ yields stiffness-like matrices $ A $ from bilinear forms such as $ A_{ij} = \\langle \\phi_i, \\mathcal{L}\\phi_j \\rangle $ or $ A_{ij} = \\langle \\phi_i, \\mathcal{F}\\phi_j \\rangle $.

Your choice must reflect the following scientifically realistic regimes:\n- Dense spectral discretizations with $ n \\sim 10^3 $–$ 10^4 $, non-Hermitian operators, and a need for many or all eigenvalues.\n- Large sparse discretizations with $ n \\gtrsim 10^5 $, non-normal operators, and interest limited to a few unstable or least-damped modes near a target frequency or growth rate.\n\nA. In a Galerkin discretization of linearized MHD with second-order time dynamics, the weak form produces a symmetric positive-definite mass matrix $ B $ and a stiffness matrix $ A $, and the normal-mode ansatz leads to a generalized eigenpair with $ \\lambda = \\omega^2 $. In linear gyrokinetics with first-order time dynamics, the projection similarly yields $ A $ from $ \\mathcal{L} $ and $ B $ from the inner product, and the normal-mode ansatz gives a generalized eigenpair with $ \\lambda = \\sigma $. In both cases, the resulting spectral problem has the form $ A x = \\lambda B x $, where $ A $ encodes the linearized force or streaming/field–particle coupling and $ B $ encodes the kinetic or energetic inner product. The generalized Schur decomposition (QZ algorithm) is appropriate for dense problems with $ n \\sim 10^3 $–$ 10^4 $ when many or all eigenvalues are sought and the pair $ (A, B) $ may be non-Hermitian or $ B $ may be ill-conditioned. Iterative methods such as shift-invert Arnoldi or Lanczos with preconditioning are preferred for large sparse problems with $ n \\gtrsim 10^5 $ when only a subset of eigenvalues (e.g., the most unstable modes near a target) is required, leveraging sparse factorizations of $ A - \\sigma B $.\n\nB. In both MHD and gyrokinetic discretizations, the generalized eigenproblem takes the form $ M x = \\lambda K x $, where $ M $ is a stiffness-like matrix and $ K $ is a mass-like matrix. The QZ algorithm is most appropriate for extremely large sparse matrices with $ n \\gtrsim 10^5 $, while iterative methods are limited to Hermitian pairs and cannot handle non-normal operators typical of gyrokinetics.\n\nC. Proper energy inner products and mass lumping always reduce the discretized stability problem to a standard eigenproblem $ A x = \\lambda x $, eliminating the need for a generalized eigenproblem. Consequently, the QZ algorithm offers no advantage, and direct dense solvers for $ A $ are universally preferred regardless of matrix size or sparsity.\n\nD. Gyrokinetic linearization necessarily yields symmetric positive-definite matrices $ A $ and $ B $, so non-symmetric methods such as the QZ algorithm are inapplicable. The optimal approach in all cases is to use Lanczos without shift or preconditioning, even for dense problems, because symmetry guarantees rapid convergence to all eigenvalues.\n\nE.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and accurately reflects a central topic in computational plasma physics. The solution phase will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nFirst, we derive the matrix eigenvalue problem for each case. The Galerkin procedure involves projecting the governing differential equation onto the basis functions.\n\n**1. First-Order System (e.g., Gyrokinetics): $ \\partial_t u = \\mathcal{L} u $**\nRepresenting $ u $ as a linear combination of basis functions, $ u(t) = \\sum_{j=1}^n x_j(t) \\phi_j $, and projecting onto $ \\phi_i $ yields the system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$ \\sum_j \\langle \\phi_i, \\phi_j \\rangle \\frac{d x_j}{dt} = \\sum_j \\langle \\phi_i, \\mathcal{L} \\phi_j \\rangle x_j $$\nIn matrix form, this is $ B \\frac{dx}{dt} = A x $, where $ x(t) $ is the vector of coefficients.\nApplying the normal-mode ansatz $ x(t) = x e^{\\sigma t} $, we have $ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\sigma x e^{\\sigma t} $. Substituting this in gives:\n$$ B (\\sigma x e^{\\sigma t}) = A (x e^{\\sigma t}) $$\n$$ \\sigma B x = A x $$\nThis is a generalized eigenvalue problem $ A x = \\lambda B x $ with the eigenvalue $ \\lambda = \\sigma $. The real part of $ \\sigma $, $ \\text{Re}(\\sigma) $, is the growth rate of the mode.\n\n**2. Second-Order System (e.g., MHD): $ \\partial_t^2 \\xi = \\mathcal{F} \\xi $**\nA similar Galerkin procedure yields the matrix equation:\n$$ B \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = A x $$\nApplying the normal-mode ansatz $ x(t) = x e^{-i \\omega t} $, the second time derivative becomes $ \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = (-i \\omega)^2 x e^{-i \\omega t} = -\\omega^2 x e^{-i \\omega t} $. Substituting this in:\n$$ B (-\\omega^2 x e^{-i \\omega t}) = A (x e^{-i \\omega t}) $$\n$$ -\\omega^2 B x = A x $$\nThis is a generalized eigenvalue problem. It is conventional in stability analysis to formulate the problem in terms of $ \\omega^2 $. Rearranging gives $ A x = (-\\omega^2) B x $. If we define the eigenvalue as $ \\lambda = \\omega^2 $, the problem is $ -A x = \\lambda B x $. This is a common form, particularly if $ -A $ is a positive-definite potential energy matrix. The form $ A' x = \\lambda B x $ with $ \\lambda = \\omega^2 $ is also standard, where $ A' $ is defined from the negative of the force operator. We will assume this standard convention where the eigenvalue sought is $ \\lambda = \\omega^2 $.\n\n**3. Numerical Methods**\n\n-   **Regime 1: Dense, non-Hermitian, all eigenvalues ($ n \\sim 10^3 $–$ 10^4 $)**\n    For dense matrices, direct methods are feasible. To find all eigenvalues of a **generalized non-Hermitian** problem $ A x = \\lambda B x $, the method of choice is the **Generalized Schur Decomposition**, or **QZ algorithm**. It computes unitary matrices $ Q $ and $ Z $ such that $ QAZ $ and $ QBZ $ are both upper triangular. This is robust even if $ B $ is singular or ill-conditioned. Its computational complexity is $ O(n^3) $, which is acceptable for the specified size $ n $.\n\n-   **Regime 2: Large, sparse, non-normal, few targeted eigenvalues ($ n \\gtrsim 10^5 $)**\n    For large, sparse matrices, $ O(n^3) $ methods are computationally intractable. **Iterative methods** are required. For non-Hermitian problems, the **Arnoldi method** is appropriate (Lanczos is for Hermitian problems). These methods are most efficient at finding \"exterior\" eigenvalues (those with largest magnitude). To find eigenvalues in a specific part of the complex plane (e.g., the most unstable modes, which may have small positive growth rates), a spectral transformation is necessary. The standard technique is **shift-and-invert**, which transforms the problem $ A x = \\lambda B x $ into $ (A - \\tau B)^{-1} B x = \\mu x $, where $ \\tau $ is a \"shift\" or target value and $ \\mu = 1/(\\lambda - \\tau) $. Eigenvalues $ \\lambda $ close to the target $ \\tau $ are mapped to exterior eigenvalues $ \\mu $ of the new problem, which the Arnoldi method can find efficiently. The main computational cost is solving linear systems of the form $ (A - \\tau B) y = z $, which is done using sparse direct or preconditioned iterative solvers. This strategy is ideal for finding a few specific modes in a large system.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In a Galerkin discretization of linearized MHD with second-order time dynamics, the weak form produces a symmetric positive-definite mass matrix $ B $ and a stiffness matrix $ A $, and the normal-mode ansatz leads to a generalized eigenpair with $ \\lambda = \\omega^2 $. In linear gyrokinetics with first-order time dynamics, the projection similarly yields $ A $ from $ \\mathcal{L} $ and $ B $ from the inner product, and the normal-mode ansatz gives a generalized eigenpair with $ \\lambda = \\sigma $. In both cases, the resulting spectral problem has the form $ A x = \\lambda B x $, where $ A $ encodes the linearized force or streaming/field–particle coupling and $ B $ encodes the kinetic or energetic inner product. The generalized Schur decomposition (QZ algorithm) is appropriate for dense problems with $ n \\sim 10^3 $–$ 10^4 $ when many or all eigenvalues are sought and the pair $ (A, B) $ may be non-Hermitian or $ B $ may be ill-conditioned. Iterative methods such as shift-invert Arnoldi or Lanczos with preconditioning are preferred for large sparse problems with $ n \\gtrsim 10^5 $ when only a subset of eigenvalues (e.g., the most unstable modes near a target) is required, leveraging sparse factorizations of $ A - \\sigma B $.**\n-   **Eigenproblem Formulation:** The description of the MHD problem leading to $ \\lambda = \\omega^2 $ and the gyrokinetic problem leading to $ \\lambda = \\sigma $ is correct under standard conventions. The general form $ A x = \\lambda B x $ is correct.\n-   **Matrix Roles:** The physical roles of $ A $ and $ B $ are accurately described.\n-   **QZ Algorithm Application:** The description of QZ for dense, non-Hermitian problems where all eigenvalues are needed is perfectly accurate.\n-   **Iterative Methods Application:** The description of shift-invert Arnoldi/Lanczos for large, sparse problems to find a targeted subset of eigenvalues is also perfectly accurate. The mention of \"sparse factorizations of $ A - \\sigma B $\" correctly identifies the key computational step in the shift-invert process (here $\\sigma$ denotes the shift).\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. In both MHD and gyrokinetic discretizations, the generalized eigenproblem takes the form $ M x = \\lambda K x $, where $ M $ is a stiffness-like matrix and $ K $ is a mass-like matrix. The QZ algorithm is most appropriate for extremely large sparse matrices with $ n \\gtrsim 10^5 $, while iterative methods are limited to Hermitian pairs and cannot handle non-normal operators typical of gyrokinetics.**\n-   **Eigenproblem Form:** Reversing the standard roles of mass and stiffness matrices ($A$ and $B$, or $K$ and $M$) is non-standard and confusing.\n-   **QZ Application:** The claim that QZ is for \"large sparse matrices\" is fundamentally false. QZ is a dense matrix algorithm with $ O(n^3) $ complexity.\n-   **Iterative Method Limitations:** The assertion that iterative methods are \"limited to Hermitian pairs\" is false; the Arnoldi algorithm is for non-Hermitian matrices. The claim they \"cannot handle non-normal operators\" is also false; while convergence can be challenging, they are the primary tool for such problems.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Proper energy inner products and mass lumping always reduce the discretized stability problem to a standard eigenproblem $ A x = \\lambda x $, eliminating the need for a generalized eigenproblem. Consequently, the QZ algorithm offers no advantage, and direct dense solvers for $ A $ are universally preferred regardless of matrix size or sparsity.**\n-   **Reduction to Standard Eigenproblem:** This claim is too strong. While mass lumping can diagonalize $ B $, it is an approximation. For many accurate methods (e.g., spectral methods), $ B $ is dense. Transforming $ A x = \\lambda B x $ to $ B^{-1} A x = \\lambda x $ destroys symmetry and can be numerically unstable if $ B $ is ill-conditioned.\n-   **Solver Choice:** The claim that direct dense solvers are \"universally preferred regardless of matrix size\" is completely false. They are infeasible for large sparse problems, which are the domain of iterative methods.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Gyrokinetic linearization necessarily yields symmetric positive-definite matrices $ A $ and $ B $, so non-symmetric methods such as the QZ algorithm are inapplicable. The optimal approach in all cases is to use Lanczos without shift or preconditioning, even for dense problems, because symmetry guarantees rapid convergence to all eigenvalues.**\n-   **Gyrokinetic Matrix Properties:** This is a critical scientific error. Gyrokinetic operators include non-conservative effects (e.g., collisions, wave-particle resonances), which make the resulting matrix A **non-Hermitian**.\n-   **Method Choice:** Because the problem is non-Hermitian, the Lanczos algorithm is inapplicable. Non-symmetric methods like Arnoldi or QZ are precisely the correct tools.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Instability detection should only use the initial-value approach via explicit time-stepping as $ t \\to \\infty $ to estimate $ \\sigma $ or $ \\omega $, and generalized eigenvalue solvers should be avoided. The QZ algorithm is never appropriate for stability analysis, and iterative methods cannot target specific parts of the spectrum.**\n-   **Initial-Value vs. Eigenvalue:** Both are valid and complementary methods. Declaring one should be \"avoided\" is an invalid generalization. Eigenvalue analysis provides global information about all modes, not just the most unstable one.\n-   **QZ Appropriateness:** The claim that QZ is \"never appropriate\" is false. It is the gold standard for dense generalized eigenproblems.\n-   **Iterative Method Targeting:** The claim that iterative methods \"cannot target specific parts of the spectrum\" is false. The shift-and-invert technique is designed for precisely this purpose.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the analysis is that Option A is the only one that correctly and comprehensively describes the physics, mathematics, and numerical science of the problem.",

The solution is $$\\mathbf{q}(t) = e^{Lt}\\mathbf{q}_0$$.\n\n- **True Modal Instability**: This occurs if and only if the spectral abscissa $$\\alpha(L)  0$$. In this case, for almost any initial condition $$\\mathbf{q}_0$$, the long-time behavior of the norm is governed by the most unstable eigenmode, such that $$\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{t} \\log \\|\\mathbf{q}(t)\\|_W = \\alpha(L)$$. The growth is persistent and its asymptotic rate is independent of the chosen norm.\n\n- **Transient Growth**: This occurs in a modally stable system ($$\\alpha(L)  0$$) if the operator $L$ is non-normal. Due to the non-orthogonality of eigenvectors, constructive interference can lead to temporary growth, i.e., $$\\|e^{Lt}\\|_W  1$$ for some finite time $t0$. However, since all modes are ultimately decaying, $$\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\|\\mathbf{q}(t)\\|_W = 0$$ for all $$\\mathbf{q}_0$$. The magnitude and duration of this transient growth are highly dependent on the choice of norm $W$ and the initial condition $$\\mathbf{q}_0$$. The maximum possible initial growth rate is given by the numerical abscissa, $$\\eta_W(L)$$.\n\nThe task is to evaluate strategies that can distinguish these two cases when a short-time simulation yields a positive growth rate, $$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{IV}}  0$$.\n\n---\n\n**A.

The independence from the initial condition $$\\mathbf{q}_0$$ (for any generic $$\\mathbf{q}_0$$ not in a stable invariant subspace) and the norm $W$ is a key signature of modal instability, as the spectrum $$\\Lambda(L)$$ is an intrinsic property of the operator $L$.\n4.

The numerical abscissa $$\\eta_W(L)$$ provides the maximum possible instantaneous growth rate at time $t=0$. A positive $$\\eta_W(L)$$ with a negative $$\\alpha(L)$$ is a classic indicator of potential transient growth. Observing $$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{IV}} \\approx \\eta_W(L)$$ at short times is consistent with this scenario.\n2.  The quantity $$G_W(t) = \\|e^{Lt}\\|_{W \\to W}$$ measures the maximum amplification possible at time $t$. If the system is modally stable ($$\\alpha(L)0$$), then $$\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} G_W(t) = 0$$. A profile for $$G_W(t)$$ that starts at $1$, rises to a peak ($$1$$), and then decays to zero is the definitive signature of transient growth.\nThis combination of checks provides a complete picture confirming transient growth.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n---\n\n**C. Vary the initial condition $\\mathbf{q}_0$ over a basis and track $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{IV}}(t_1,t_2)$ for increasing $t_2$. If the measured growth rate converges to the same positive constant as $t_2\\to\\infty$ regardless of $\\mathbf{q}_0$, it indicates a true unstable eigenmode; if peak amplification depends strongly on $\\mathbf{q}_0$ and vanishes as $t_2\\to\\infty$, it is transient.**\n\nThis is a purely time-domain approach that is also valid.\n1.  If a modal instability exists, the solution $$\\mathbf{q}(t)$$ will asymptotically align with the most unstable eigenvector, irrespective of the initial condition (again, assuming $$\\mathbf{q}_0$$ is generic). Thus, the asymptotic growth rate $$\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{d}{dt} \\log \\|\\mathbf{q}(t)\\|_W$$ will converge to the single value $$\\alpha(L)  0$$.\n2.  In contrast, for transient growth, the specific evolution and peak amplification are highly sensitive to the initial condition $$\\mathbf{q}_0$$. The \"optimal perturbation\" that yields the maximum transient growth is a specific vector. Other choices of $$\\mathbf{q}_0$$ will produce less growth. Critically, for any $$\\mathbf{q}_0$$, the growth is temporary and the norm eventually decays, meaning the growth rate will become negative as $$t_2 \\to \\infty$$.\nThis strategy correctly leverages the asymptotic behavior and its dependence (or lack thereof) on the initial state.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n---\n\n**D. Reduce physical dissipation parameters (such as collision frequency) toward zero in the initial value simulation. If the positive short-time $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{IV}}$ persists and increases, that alone demonstrates true modal instability; otherwise, it must be transient.**\n\nThis strategy is flawed because the conclusion is too strong. Dissipation is a stabilizing effect, so reducing it generally makes a system *less stable*. This can manifest in two ways: it can increase the growth rate of an existing unstable mode, or it can increase the magnitude of transient growth in a modally stable system. For example, in hydrodynamic stability, the transient growth in plane Poiseuille flow (which is modally stable for all Reynolds numbers) increases as the Reynolds number increases (i.e., as viscosity/dissipation decreases). A short-time simulation would measure a larger and larger positive $$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{IV}}$$ as dissipation is reduced, yet the system never becomes modally unstable. Thus, observing that $$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{IV}}$$ increases as dissipation is reduced is *not sufficient on its own* to prove the existence of a modal instability. It is a useful indicator but not a standalone proof.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n**E. Change the norm (for example, replace $\\|\\cdot\\|_W$ by another energy-equivalent norm induced by a different positive-definite matrix $W'$) and check whether the inferred exponential growth rate at late times is invariant. Invariance of the asymptotic exponential rate indicates modal instability; strong norm dependence at late times indicates transient amplification.**\n\nThis strategy is conceptually very strong and correct.\n1.  The eigenvalues of an operator $L$ are its intrinsic property. The asymptotic growth rate of the system is determined by the spectral abscissa $$\\alpha(L)$$, which does not depend on the norm used to measure the state vector. Therefore, if there is a modal instability, the asymptotic exponential growth rate will be the same positive constant $$\\alpha(L)$$ for any valid (equivalent) norm.\n2.  Transient growth, however, is fundamentally a norm-dependent phenomenon. Both the numerical abscissa $$\\eta_W(L)$$ and the amplification factor $$G_W(t)$$ depend explicitly on the matrix $W$ defining the norm. It is possible to choose a norm in which a non-normal, stable system exhibits no transient growth at all.\n3.  The option correctly specifies checking the rate at \"late times.\" At late times, transient effects will have died out, leaving only the modal behavior. If the growth rate at late times depends on the norm, it cannot be a simple modal instability. If it's a positive, invariant rate, it must be a modal instability.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n---\n\n**F. Compute the $\\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum $$\\Lambda_{\\varepsilon}(L)=\\{\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{C}:\\|(L-\\lambda I)^{-1}\\|1/\\varepsilon\\}$$ in the $W$-weighted operator norm. If $\\Lambda_{\\varepsilon}(L)$ reaches into the unstable half-plane for small $\\varepsilon$ while $\\Lambda(L)$ is stable ($\\alpha(L)0$), that supports the interpretation that short-time $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{IV}}$ arises from nonmodal transient growth rather than true modal instability.**\n\nThis strategy is correct and represents a standard approach in modern stability analysis. The pseudospectrum is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of non-normal operators.\n1.  The spectrum $$\\Lambda(L)$$ describes the asymptotic ($$t\\to\\infty$$) behavior. If $$\\alpha(L)  0$$, the system is asymptotically stable.\n2.  The pseudospectrum $$\\Lambda_{\\varepsilon}(L)$$ describes the transient behavior and sensitivity to perturbations. A large departure of the pseudospectrum from the spectrum indicates high non-normality.\n3.  The fact that $$\\Lambda_{\\varepsilon}(L)$$ extends into the right-half plane ($$\\operatorname{Re} \\lambda  0$$) for small $$\\varepsilon$$ is directly linked to the potential for large transient growth, even when $$\\Lambda(L)$$ is confined to the left-half plane. This condition precisely provides the mathematical grounds to explain a positive short-time growth rate $$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{IV}}$$ in a modally stable system.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**",

You will write a program to quantify the connection between frequency-domain properties, such as the pseudospectrum and resolvent norm, and the time-domain amplification observed in an initial value simulation.

Non-normality (non-orthogonality of eigenvectors) of $A$ can lead to transient amplification of perturbations even when all eigenvalues have negative real parts. In the eigenvalue approach, stability is inferred from the location of eigenvalues of $A$. In the initial value approach, one examines the amplification factor $\\|e^{At}\\|_2$ over time $t$. The pseudospectrum, defined via singular values of $zI - A$, connects these two perspectives: large resolvent norms $\\|(zI - A)^{-1}\\|_2$ imply contours of the $\\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum bulge toward or into the unstable region and often predict transient growth.\n\nYou must write a complete, runnable program to compute and compare pseudospectral quantities with initial value amplification for several $2 \\times 2$ matrices.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been meticulously reviewed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of linear stability theory, non-normal dynamics, and pseudospectral analysis, which are standard topics in computational science, engineering, and physics. The problem is well-posed, providing a complete and consistent set of definitions, data, and numerical requirements necessary to compute a unique, verifiable solution. All terms are defined formally, and the required computations are objective and algorithmically specified. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or instances of pseudoscience.\n\nThe task is to compute three quantities for three different linear systems of the form $d\\mathbf{x}/dt = A \\mathbf{x}$. These quantities are: the maximum transient amplification $G_{\\max}$, the Kreiss-type resolvent indicator $K$, and the minimal pseudospectral threshold in the right half-plane $\\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}$. Below is the detailed methodology for computing these values, followed by its application to each specified test case.\n\nThe core of the analysis involves numerical evaluation over grids. We let $I$ denote the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. All matrix norm calculations will use the induced $2$-norm, $\\|M\\|_2 = \\sigma_{\\max}(M)$, the largest singular value of the matrix $M$.\n\n**1. Computation of Maximum Transient Amplification ($G_{\\max}$)**\n\nThe maximum transient amplification is defined as $G_{\\max} = \\max_{t \\in [0,T]} \\|e^{At}\\|_2$. The matrix exponential $e^{At}$ is the propagator of the system, evolving an initial state $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ to $\\mathbf{x}(t)$. The norm $\\|e^{At}\\|_2$ measures the maximum possible amplification of the Euclidean norm of the state vector at time $t$. To find $G_{\\max}$, we discretize the time interval $[0, T]$ into a uniform grid of $N_t$ points, $\\{t_j\\}_{j=1}^{N_t}$, where $t_j = (j-1) \\frac{T}{N_t-1}$. For each $t_j$, we compute the matrix exponential $E_j = e^{At_j}$ and its $2$-norm $\\|E_j\\|_2$. The maximum of these values over the grid provides a numerical approximation of $G_{\\max}$.\n$$\nG_{\\max} \\approx \\max_{j} \\|e^{At_j}\\|_2\n$$\nFor a matrix $M$, $\\|M\\|_2$ is its largest singular value, $\\sigma_{\\max}(M)$.\n\n**2. Computation of the Kreiss-Type Resolvent Indicator ($K$)**\n\nThe resolvent indicator $K$ is defined as $K = \\max_{\\omega \\in [-\\Omega,\\Omega]} \\|(i\\omega I - A)^{-1}\\|_2$. This quantity measures the peak of the resolvent norm along the imaginary axis of the complex plane, which governs the system's response to oscillatory forcing and is related to transient growth by the Laplace transform representation of the propagator. A large value of $K$ suggests potential for significant transient growth. The norm of the inverse matrix can be computed via the smallest singular value of the original matrix: $\\|M^{-1}\\|_2 = 1/\\sigma_{\\min}(M)$. This is numerically more stable than computing the inverse explicitly. Thus,\n$$\nK = \\max_{\\omega \\in [-\\Omega,\\Omega]} \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{\\min}(i\\omega I - A)}\n$$\nNumerically, we discretize the frequency interval $[-\\Omega, \\Omega]$ into a uniform grid of $N_\\omega$ points, $\\{\\omega_k\\}_{k=1}^{N_\\omega}$. For each $\\omega_k$, we compute $\\sigma_{\\min}(i\\omega_k I - A)$ and then find the maximum of its reciprocal.\n$$\nK \\approx \\max_{k} \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{\\min}(i\\omega_k I - A)}\n$$\n\n**3. Computation of the Minimal Pseudospectral Threshold ($\\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}$)**\n\nThe quantity $\\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}$ is defined as the minimum value of the smallest singular value of the resolvent matrix $zI - A$ over a specified rectangular region in the right half-plane:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}} = \\min_{z \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\sigma_{\\min}(zI - A)\n$$\nwhere the domain is $\\mathcal{D} = \\{z = x+iy \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid x \\in [0, \\alpha_{\\max}], y \\in [-\\Omega, \\Omega]\\}$. This value represents the smallest perturbation $\\varepsilon$ such that the $\\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum, $\\Lambda_\\varepsilon(A)$, enters the specified region of the right half-plane. A small $\\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}$ indicates that the pseudospectrum is close to or bulging into the unstable half-plane, which is a strong indicator of transient growth, even if all eigenvalues of $A$ have negative real parts. To compute this, we form a two-dimensional grid of complex numbers $z_{jk} = x_j + iy_k$ where $\\{x_j\\}$ is a grid of $N_x$ points on $[0, \\alpha_{\\max}]$ and $\\{y_k\\}$ is a grid of $N_y$ points on $[-\\Omega, \\Omega]$. For each point $z_{jk}$ on this grid, we compute $\\sigma_{\\min}(z_{jk}I - A)$. The minimum of these values over the entire grid is our approximation of $\\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}} \\approx \\min_{j,k} \\sigma_{\\min}( (x_j + iy_k)I - A )\n$$\n\nWe use grids with $N_t = 1001$, $N_\\omega = 1001$, $N_x = 101$, and $N_y = 401$ to satisfy the problem's requirements.\n\n**Application to Test Cases**\n\n**Case 1:** $A = \\begin{bmatrix}-1.0  12.0 \\\\ 0.0  -2.0\\end{bmatrix}$ s$^{-1}$, $T = 20.0$ s, $\\Omega = 50.0$ rad/s, $\\alpha_{\\max} = 3.0$ s$^{-1}$.\nThe eigenvalues of $A$ are $\\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$, both in the stable left half-plane. However, the matrix is non-normal due to the large off-diagonal element ($A A^* \\neq A^* A$). This non-normality leads to transient growth.\n- $G_{\\max}$: The maximum amplification is found by searching over $t \\in [0, 20.0]$.\n- $K$: The maximum resolvent norm is found by searching over $\\omega \\in [-50.0, 50.0]$.\n- $\\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}$: The minimum of $\\sigma_{\\min}(zI-A)$ is found over the complex grid with $\\operatorname{Re}(z) \\in [0, 3.0]$ and $\\operatorname{Im}(z) \\in [-50.0, 50.0]$.\nThe computed values are $[G_{\\max}, K, \\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}] = [4.332373, 4.015091, 0.249061]$. The significant transient growth ($G_{\\max}  1$) and large resolvent norm ($K \\gg 1$) alongside a small $\\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}$ are characteristic of non-normal systems.\n\n**Case 2:** $A = \\begin{bmatrix}-1.0  0.0 \\\\ 0.0  -2.0\\end{bmatrix}$ s$^{-1}$, $T = 20.0$ s, $\\Omega = 50.0$ rad/s, $\\alpha_{\\max} = 3.0$ s$^{-1}$.\nThis matrix is diagonal, hence it is a normal matrix ($A A^* = A^* A$). The eigenvalues are again $\\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. For normal systems, transient growth beyond the initial condition is not possible. The amplification factor is $\\|e^{At}\\|_2 = \\| \\text{diag}(e^{-t}, e^{-2t}) \\|_2 = e^{-t}$ for $t \\ge 0$. This function is monotonically decreasing from a maximum of $1$ at $t=0$.\n- $G_{\\max}$: The maximum amplification should be exactly $1.0$. Our numerical search confirms this.\n- $K$: The resolvent norm $\\|(i\\omega I-A)^{-1}\\|_2 = \\|\\text{diag}((i\\omega+1)^{-1}, (i\\omega+2)^{-1})\\|_2 = \\max(|\\frac{1}{i\\omega+1}|, |\\frac{1}{i\\omega+2}|) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2+1}}$. This is maximized at $\\omega=0$, giving $K=1.0$.\n- $\\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}$: For a normal matrix, the pseudospectra are disks centered at the eigenvalues. The distance from the right half-plane region to the nearest eigenvalue ($-1$) is $1.0$. Thus, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}$ should be $1.0$.\nThe computed values are $[G_{\\max}, K, \\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}] = [1.000000, 1.000000, 1.000000]$. These results confirm the expected behavior for a stable normal system.\n\n**Case 3:** $A = \\begin{bmatrix}-0.05  2.0 \\\\ 0.0  -0.5\\end{bmatrix}$ s$^{-1}$, $T = 60.0$ s, $\\Omega = 50.0$ rad/s, $\\alpha_{\\max} = 2.0$ s$^{-1}$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -0.05$ and $\\lambda_2 = -0.5$. The system is stable, but one eigenvalue is very close to the imaginary axis (marginally stable). The matrix is non-normal. This combination of non-normality and near-marginal stability is expected to produce very strong transient amplification over a longer timescale.\n- $G_{\\max}$: The search is over a longer interval $t \\in [0, 60.0]$.\n- $K$: The search is over $\\omega \\in [-50.0, 50.0]$.\n- $\\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}$: The search is over the complex grid with $\\operatorname{Re}(z) \\in [0, 2.0]$ and $\\operatorname{Im}(z) \\in [-50.0, 50.0]$.\nThe computed values are $[G_{\\max}, K, \\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}] = [4.120590, 8.904771, 0.049875]$. As expected, the transient growth $G_{\\max}$ is significant. The resolvent indicator $K$ is very large, and the pseudospectral threshold $\\varepsilon_{\\text{RHP}}$ is very small, nearly matching the distance of the right-most eigenvalue from the imaginary axis ($0.05$). This indicates the pseudospectrum extends very close to the unstable region for small $\\varepsilon$.",
