This requires deriving and evaluating the local magnetic shear, $\\hat{s}$, and the normalized pressure gradient parameter, $\\alpha$.\n\nFirst, we address the magnetic shear, $\\hat{s}$. For a large-aspect-ratio, circular-cross-section tokamak, the standard definition of the local magnetic shear is:\n$$\n\\hat{s}(r) = \\frac{r}{q(r)} \\frac{dq}{dr}\n$$\nThe safety factor profile is given as $q(r) = q_0 + \\Delta q \\, (r/a)^2$.

Substituting these values:\n$$\n\\hat{s}(r_0) = \\frac{2 (2.6) (0.5)^2}{1.2 + 2.6 (0.5)^2} = \\frac{2 (2.6) (0.25)}{1.2 + 2.6 (0.25)} = \\frac{1.3}{1.2 + 0.65} = \\frac{1.3}{1.85} \\approx 0.702703\n$$\n\nNext, we address the normalized pressure gradient parameter, $\\alpha$. In the standard $s$-$\\alpha$ model for a large-aspect-ratio, circular geometry, this parameter is defined as:\n$$\n\\alpha(r) = -R q(r)^2 \\frac{d\\beta}{dr}\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the major radius and $\\beta(r)$ is the local normalized plasma beta. This definition arises from normalizing the ballooning mode equation, where $\\alpha$ represents the pressure-gradient-driven instability term. The plasma beta profile is given as $\\beta(r) = \\beta_0 \\left[1 - (r/a)^2\\right]^2$. We compute its derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\beta}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\beta_0 \\left[1 - \\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\right]^2 \\right) = \\beta_0 \\cdot 2 \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{2r}{a^2}\\right) = -\\frac{4 \\beta_0 r}{a^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\alpha(r)$:\n$$\n\\alpha(r) = -R \\left(q_0 + \\Delta q (r/a)^2\\right)^2 \\left(-\\frac{4 \\beta_0 r}{a^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{4 R \\beta_0 r}{a^2} \\left(q_0 + \\Delta q (r/a)^2\\right)^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\right)\n$$\nWe evaluate this at $r_0 = 0.25 \\ \\mathrm{m}$ (or $x_0 = 0.5$) using the given parameters $R = 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $a = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, and $\\beta_0 = 0.04$.

In the context of ideal MHD ballooning stability, these two parameters represent the primary opposing effects. The parameter $\\alpha$ is proportional to the plasma pressure gradient, which is the fundamental source of free energy that drives the ballooning instability. This drive is strongest in regions of unfavorable magnetic field curvature on the outboard side of the tokamak. The magnetic shear, $\\hat{s}$, represents the stabilization mechanism from magnetic field line bending. A non-zero shear means the pitch of the magnetic field lines changes with radius. A perturbation that is radially localized must therefore bend to conform to the field lines, which requires energy and thus stabilizes the mode. In the first region of stability, a higher positive shear allows for a higher stable pressure gradient. The competition between the driving term ($\\alpha$) and the stabilizing term ($\\hat{s}$) determines the local stability.\n\nFinally, we compute the composite ballooning balance parameter $\\Psi$:\n$$\n\\Psi = \\hat{s}(r_0) - \\alpha(r_0)\n$$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$\n\\Psi = 0.702703 - 1.2321 = -0.529397\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested, gives:\n$$\n\\Psi \\approx -0.5294\n$$\nThe negative value of $\\Psi$ suggests that at the flux surface $r_0 = 0.25 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, the pressure gradient drive ($\\alpha$) outweighs the stabilization from magnetic shear ($\\hat{s}$), indicating that this surface is likely unstable to ideal ballooning modes according to this simplified model.",

This exercise moves from the concept of a stability threshold to the quantitative behavior of a transport model by introducing the concept of 'stiffness'.

            "solution": "The problem asks for three main tasks: first, to justify the definition of transport stiffness as the right-hand derivative of the normalized heat flux $\\hat{Q}$ with respect to the temperature gradient drive $x$; second, to compute this stiffness for a specific case and discuss the model's behavior; and third, to evaluate the stiffness for a given set of parameters.\n\nFirst, we justify the definition of transport stiffness. The problem statement qualitatively defines transport stiffness as \"the sensitivity of the normalized turbulent heat flux to the drive near the critical gradient $x_c$\". In mathematical terms, the sensitivity of a function $f(y)$ to changes in its independent variable $y$ is quantified by its derivative, $\\mathrm{d}f/\\mathrm{d}y$. In our context, the function is the normalized turbulent heat flux, $\\hat{Q}$, and the independent variable, or \"drive\", is the dimensionless temperature gradient, $x$. Thus, the sensitivity is given by the derivative $\\partial \\hat{Q}/\\partial x$.\n\nThe model for $\\hat{Q}(x)$ is given as\n$$\n\\hat{Q}(x) \\;=\\; \\alpha \\,\\frac{\\left(x - x_c\\right)^{p}}{1 + \\beta \\left(x - x_c\\right)}\\,H\\!\\left(x - x_c\\right)\n$$\nwhere $H(z)$ is the Heaviside step function, defined as $H(z)=0$ for $z<0$ and $H(z)=1$ for $z \\ge 0$. This model embodies the critical gradient concept: for $x \\le x_c$, the term $x - x_c \\le 0$, so $H(x-x_c)=0$ and consequently $\\hat{Q}(x)=0$. This means turbulent transport is not \"turned on\" until the gradient drive $x$ exceeds the critical threshold $x_c$. The phrase \"near the critical gradient\" directs us to examine the behavior of $\\hat{Q}(x)$ in the immediate vicinity of $x=x_c$. Since we are interested in the onset of transport as the drive increases past the threshold, the relevant behavior is captured by the limit as $x$ approaches $x_c$ from above ($x \\to x_c^{+}$). This naturally leads to the definition of the right-hand derivative at $x_c$:\n$$\n\\text{Stiffness} \\equiv \\lim_{h \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{\\hat{Q}(x_c+h) - \\hat{Q}(x_c)}{h} = \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\hat{Q}}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=x_c^{+}}\n$$\nThis formalizes the physical notion of how strongly the heat flux responds to a small increase in the drive just above the critical point, which is the essence of stiffness.\n\nSecond, we compute this stiffness for the specific case where the exponent $p=1$. For $x > x_c$, the Heaviside function is $H(x-x_c)=1$, and the model simplifies to:\n$$\n\\hat{Q}(x) = \\alpha \\frac{x - x_c}{1 + \\beta(x - x_c)}, \\quad \\text{for } x > x_c\n$$\nTo find the stiffness, we must compute the derivative $\\partial \\hat{Q}/\\partial x$. We use the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}z}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, with $u(x) = \\alpha(x-x_c)$ and $v(x) = 1 + \\beta(x-x_c)$. The derivatives are $u'(x) = \\alpha$ and $v'(x) = \\beta$.\nApplying the rule, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{Q}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{(\\alpha)\\left(1 + \\beta(x - x_c)\\right) - \\left(\\alpha(x - x_c)\\right)(\\beta)}{\\left(1 + \\beta(x - x_c)\\right)^2}\n$$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$\n\\alpha + \\alpha\\beta(x - x_c) - \\alpha\\beta(x - x_c) = \\alpha\n$$\nThus, the derivative for $x > x_c$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{Q}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\left(1 + \\beta(x - x_c)\\right)^2}\n$$\nTo find the stiffness, we evaluate this expression in the limit $x \\to x_c^{+}$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\hat{Q}}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x_c^{+}} = \\lim_{x \\to x_c^{+}} \\frac{\\alpha}{\\left(1 + \\beta(x - x_c)\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\left(1 + \\beta(x_c - x_c)\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\alpha}{(1 + 0)^2} = \\alpha\n$$\nSo, for the case $p=1$, the transport stiffness is simply the parameter $\\alpha$.\n\nNext, we discuss the onset behavior based on the exponent $p>0$. The stiffness, or the initial slope of $\\hat{Q}(x)$ at $x_c^{+}$, determines the nature of the transition. We analyze the derivative of the general form as $x \\to x_c^{+}$. Let $y = x-x_c$. For $y>0$, $\\hat{Q}(y) = \\alpha y^p / (1+\\beta y)$. The derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{Q}}{\\partial y} = \\alpha \\frac{p y^{p-1}(1+\\beta y) - y^p(\\beta)}{(1+\\beta y)^2} = \\alpha \\frac{p y^{p-1} + (p-1)\\beta y^p}{(1+\\beta y)^2}\n$$\nWe examine the limit as $y \\to 0^{+}$:\n1.  If $p=1$: $\\lim_{y \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{\\partial \\hat{Q}}{\\partial y} = \\alpha \\frac{1\\cdot y^0 + 0}{(1+\\beta y)^2} = \\alpha$. Since $\\alpha>0$, the stiffness is a finite, positive constant. This describes an **abrupt finite-slope onset**, where the flux begins to rise linearly with the excess gradient drive.\n2.  If $p>1$: The exponent $p-1$ is positive. As $y \\to 0^{+}$, both $y^{p-1} \\to 0$ and $y^p \\to 0$. The numerator approaches $0$ while the denominator approaches $1$, so $\\lim_{y \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{\\partial \\hat{Q}}{\\partial y} = 0$. This describes a **supercritical ramp with vanishing initial slope**. The flux smoothly and gradually turns on, with an initial slope of zero.\n3.  If $0<p<1$: The exponent $p-1$ is negative. As $y \\to 0^{+}$, the term $y^{p-1} \\to \\infty$. The numerator becomes infinite, so $\\lim_{y \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{\\partial \\hat{Q}}{\\partial y} = \\infty$. This describes a **singular onset at threshold**, where the slope of the flux is infinite at the threshold, implying an extremely sensitive and rapid increase in transport for any infinitesimal drive above $x_c$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the transport stiffness for the given parameter values: $\\alpha = 9.80665$, $\\beta = 0.60$, $x_c = 4.50$, and $p=1$.\nAs derived above, for the case $p=1$, the transport stiffness is equal to $\\alpha$.\n$$\n\\text{Stiffness} = \\alpha = 9.80665\n$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\text{Stiffness} \\approx 9.807\n$$\nThis value is dimensionless, consistent with the definition $\\left.\\partial \\hat{Q}/\\partial x\\right|_{x_c^{+}}$ where both $\\hat{Q}$ and $x$ are dimensionless.",

In stiff transport regimes, such as the pedestal of a fusion plasma, the turbulent thermal diffusivity $\\chi$ is very large. To resolve the sharp gradients in such regions, a fine radial mesh (small $\\Delta r$) is required. Both large $\\chi$ and small $\\Delta r$ severely restrict the maximum stable time step $\\Delta t$ for the explicit scheme, as $\\Delta t$ scales with $\\Delta r^2$ and $1/\\chi$. This makes the forward Euler scheme computationally prohibitive.\nIn contrast, the backward Euler scheme is unconditionally stable, meaning its amplification factor $|G(k)| \\le 1$ irrespective of the values of $\\Delta t$, $\\Delta r$, and $\\chi$. This allows for the selection of a much larger $\\Delta t$, limited only by a desired accuracy, not by stability. This property makes implicit schemes like backward Euler essential for efficiently simulating stiff transport problems.\n\n### Task 2: Maximum Stable Time Step Calculation\n\nFor a forward Euler scheme on a nonuniform mesh with spatially varying diffusivity, the stability condition must hold locally at every point in the domain. The global maximum stable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, is thus limited by the most restrictive region, i.e., the region with the minimum value of $\\Delta r^2 / (2\\chi)$.\nThe local stability condition is:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\Delta r_i^2}{2\\chi_i}\n$$\nwhere the index $i$ denotes a specific region (core, pedestal, or edge). The global maximum stable time step is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\min \\left( \\frac{\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{core}}^2}{2\\chi_{\\mathrm{core}}}, \\frac{\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{ped}}^2}{2\\chi_{\\mathrm{ped}}}, \\frac{\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{edge}}^2}{2\\chi_{\\mathrm{edge}}} \\right)\n$$\nWe compute this value for each region using the provided data:\n- **Core region:** $\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{core}} = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{core}} = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{core}} = \\frac{(0.015\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{2 \\times 0.80\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.000225}{1.6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.000140625\\,\\mathrm{s} = 140.625\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n- **Pedestal region:** $\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{ped}} = 0.003\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{ped}} = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{ped}} = \\frac{(0.003\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{2 \\times 1.50\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{-6}}{3.0}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 3 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 3.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n- **Edge region:** $\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{edge}} = 0.012\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{edge}} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{edge}} = \\frac{(0.012\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{2 \\times 0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.000144}{0.6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.00024\\,\\mathrm{s} = 240.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe global maximum stable time step is the minimum of these values:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\min(140.625\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}, 3.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}, 240.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}) = 3.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe pedestal region, with its combination of high diffusivity and fine grid spacing, imposes the most severe constraint on the explicit time step.\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $3.000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.",
