            "solution": "The problem statement is analyzed and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of plasma physics, specifically within the context of magnetic confinement fusion. The parameters provided are realistic for the edge region of a mid-sized tokamak, and the problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of four key plasma parameters, followed by a discussion of the electrostatic approximation in drift-reduced Braginskii models based on these calculations.\n\nFirst, we define and derive the expressions for the requested quantities from fundamental principles.\n\nThe ion cyclotron frequency, $\\Omega_i$, is the angular frequency of an ion's gyration around a magnetic field line. It is derived from the Lorentz force, which provides the necessary centripetal force for this circular motion. The force balance is $|q_i| v_{\\perp} B_0 = m_i v_{\\perp}^2 / r_{gyro}$, where $q_i$ is the ion charge, $m_i$ is the ion mass, $v_{\\perp}$ is the velocity component perpendicular to the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$, and $r_{gyro}$ is the gyroradius. The angular frequency is $\\Omega_i = v_{\\perp} / r_{gyro}$. For an ion with charge number $Z_i$ and elementary charge $e$, the charge is $q_i = Z_i e$. Thus, the ion cyclotron frequency is given by:\n$$ \\Omega_i = \\frac{Z_i e B_0}{m_i} $$\n\nThe ion sound speed, $c_s$, is a characteristic velocity for plasma phenomena that involve both ion inertia and electron pressure. In the context of low-frequency drift-wave turbulence, where electrons are assumed to be isothermal and respond rapidly along magnetic field lines to maintain quasi-neutrality, the electron pressure gradient acts as the primary restoring force. The standard definition of the ion sound speed in this context normalizes velocities and is defined using the electron temperature $T_e$. It is crucial to ensure that the temperature is in units of energy (Joules). Given $T_e$ in electron-volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$), we convert it to Joules by multiplying by the elementary charge $e$. The expression is:\n$$ c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{T_e [\\text{J}]}{m_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{T_e [\\text{eV}] \\times e}{m_i}} $$\n\nThe sound gyroradius, $\\rho_s$, is a hybrid length scale characteristic of drift-wave turbulence. It represents the gyroradius of an ion moving at the ion sound speed. It is defined as the ratio of the ion sound speed to the ion cyclotron frequency:\n$$ \\rho_s = \\frac{c_s}{\\Omega_i} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $c_s$ and $\\Omega_i$, we obtain a more fundamental form:\n$$ \\rho_s = \\frac{\\sqrt{e T_e / m_i}}{Z_i e B_0 / m_i} = \\frac{\\sqrt{m_i e T_e}}{Z_i e B_0} $$\nHere, $T_e$ must be in units of $\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nThe total plasma beta, $\\beta$, is a dimensionless parameter that measures the ratio of the plasma's thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure. The total thermal pressure is the sum of the electron and ion pressures, $P_{plasma} = P_e + P_i$. For a quasi-neutral plasma, the electron and ion number densities are related by $n_e = Z_i n_i$. Given $n$ as the electron number density, we have $n_i = n / Z_i$. The pressure is $P_{plasma} = n_e T_e + n_i T_i = n T_e + (n/Z_i)T_i$. For a deuterium plasma, $Z_i=1$, so $n_e = n_i = n$, and $P_{plasma} = n(T_e + T_i)$. The magnetic pressure is $P_{mag} = B_0^2 / (2\\mu_0)$. Both temperatures must be converted to Joules.\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{P_{plasma}}{P_{mag}} = \\frac{n(T_e[\\text{J}] + T_i[\\text{J}])}{B_0^2 / (2\\mu_0)} = \\frac{2 \\mu_0 n e (T_e[\\text{eV}] + T_i[\\text{eV}])}{B_0^2} $$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical values for these quantities using the provided data:\n- Toroidal magnetic field magnitude: $B_0 = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{T}$\n- Ion: Deuterium ($Z_i = 1$)\n- Proton mass: $m_p = 1.67262192369 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Ion mass: $m_i = 2 m_p = 2 \\times (1.67262192369 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg}) = 3.34524384738 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Electron number density: $n = 3.0 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n- Electron temperature: $T_e = 60\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n- Ion temperature: $T_i = 30\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n- Elementary charge: $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$\n- Vacuum permeability: $\\mu_0 = 4 \\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot A^{-2}}$\n\nCalculation of $\\Omega_i$:\n$$ \\Omega_i = \\frac{1 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}) \\times (2.0\\ \\mathrm{T})}{3.34524384738 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg}} \\approx 9.5788 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\nRounded to three significant figures, $\\Omega_i = 9.58 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\nCalculation of $c_s$:\nFirst, convert $T_e$ to Joules: $T_e[\\text{J}] = 60\\ \\mathrm{eV} \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J/eV}) = 9.6130598 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{J}$.\n$$ c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{9.6130598 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{J}}{3.34524384738 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg}}} \\approx 5.3606 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$\nRounded to three significant figures, $c_s = 5.36 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nCalculation of $\\rho_s$:\n$$ \\rho_s = \\frac{c_s}{\\Omega_i} = \\frac{5.3606 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{m/s}}{9.5788 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\approx 5.5962 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nRounded to three significant figures, $\\rho_s = 5.60 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nCalculation of $\\beta$:\nFirst, convert temperatures to Joules: $T_{total}[\\text{J}] = (60 + 30)\\ \\mathrm{eV} \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J/eV}) = 1.44195897 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{J}$.\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{2 \\times (4 \\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot A^{-2}}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\times (1.44195897 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{J})}{(2.0\\ \\mathrm{T})^2} \\approx 2.7179 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nRounded to three significant figures, $\\beta = 2.72 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\nFinally, we use these computed values to justify the electrostatic approximation within drift-reduced Braginskii models. The validity of this framework rests on three fundamental ordering assumptions:\n1.  Low-frequency dynamics: $\\omega / \\Omega_i \\ll 1$, where $\\omega$ is the characteristic frequency of the turbulence.\n2.  Small gyroradius scale: $\\rho_s / L_{\\perp} \\ll 1$, where $L_{\\perp}$ is the perpendicular gradient scale length.\n3.  Low plasma beta: $\\beta \\ll 1$.\n\nLet's evaluate these dimensionless ratios for the given scenario. The perpendicular gradient scale is $L_{\\perp} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\nThe small gyroradius parameter is:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho_s}{L_{\\perp}} = \\frac{5.60 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{3.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 0.0187 $$\nThis value is much less than $1$, so the small gyroradius ordering is well satisfied.\n\nFor drift-wave turbulence, the characteristic frequency scales as $\\omega \\sim \\omega_* \\approx v_{d}/L_{\\perp}$, where $v_d$ is a characteristic diamagnetic drift speed. A simpler scaling is $\\omega \\sim c_s/L_{\\perp}$. The low-frequency parameter is thus estimated as:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega}{\\Omega_i} \\sim \\frac{c_s / L_{\\perp}}{\\Omega_i} = \\frac{\\rho_s}{L_{\\perp}} \\approx 0.0187 $$\nThis value is also much less than $1$, validating the low-frequency assumption.\n\nThe plasma beta was calculated as:\n$$ \\beta = 2.72 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nThis value is very small, $\\beta \\ll 1$, so the low-beta assumption is strongly satisfied.\n\nThe electrostatic approximation consists in neglecting electromagnetic effects, specifically the inductive part of the electric field and the perturbation of the magnetic field. Faraday's law is $\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -\\partial \\vec{B} / \\partial t$. In the electrostatic limit, we assume $\\vec{E} = -\\nabla\\phi$, which implies $\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = 0$. This requires the term $\\partial \\vec{B} / \\partial t$ to be negligible. The justification for this hinges on the plasma beta.\n\nThe parameter $\\beta$ compares the thermal energy of the plasma to the magnetic field energy. A low $\\beta$ implies that the magnetic field is energetically dominant, making it very \"stiff\" or \"rigid\". Bending the magnetic field lines, which generates magnetic perturbations $\\tilde{B}$ and associated inductive electric fields, is energetically costly compared to compressing the plasma, which generates electrostatic potential perturbations $\\phi$.\n\nA more quantitative argument can be made by comparing the Alfven speed, $v_A = B_0 / \\sqrt{\\mu_0 n_i m_i}$, which characterizes the propagation of magnetic perturbations, with the ion sound speed, $c_s$. The ratio of their squares is related to beta:\n$$ \\frac{c_s^2}{v_A^2} = \\frac{T_e/m_i}{B_0^2/(\\mu_0 n m_i)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 n T_e}{B_0^2} = \\frac{\\beta_e}{2} $$\nUsing our values, $\\beta_e = \\frac{2 \\mu_0 n T_e}{B_0^2} = \\frac{2 \\mu_0 n e T_e[\\mathrm{eV}]}{B_0^2} \\approx 1.81 \\times 10^{-4}$. So, $\\frac{c_s^2}{v_A^2} = \\frac{1.81 \\times 10^{-4}}{2} \\approx 9.05 \\times 10^{-5}$. This extremely small ratio means $v_A \\gg c_s$, indicating a large separation between the time scales of magnetic (Alfvenic) and electrostatic (acoustic) phenomena.\n\nBecause $\\beta \\ll 1$, the plasma does not have enough thermal energy to significantly perturb the strong background magnetic field. Consequently, any magnetic field perturbations $\\tilde{B}$ are subdominant compared to the background field $B_0$. The inductive electric field, which scales as $E_{ind} \\sim \\omega \\tilde{B}$, is therefore negligible compared to the electrostatic field $E_{es} \\sim \\phi / L_{\\perp}$ arising from charge separation. The small computed values of $\\rho_s/L_{\\perp}$ (characterizing the normalized potential fluctuation level) and especially $\\beta$ provide a self-consistent justification for neglecting the inductive electric field and Ampere's law for the perturbation, thus validating the use of the electrostatic approximation in the drift-reduced Braginskii model for this plasma regime.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a characteristic perpendicular length scale, $L$, from the drift-reduced Braginskii model under a specific set of assumptions. The derivation proceeds by establishing a relationship between the ion density response and the electron density response through the quasi-neutrality condition, which is expressed via the conservation of charge (i.e., the divergence of the total current is zero).\n\nThe total current density is $\\boldsymbol{J} = \\boldsymbol{J}_i + \\boldsymbol{J}_e$. The charge continuity equation, or current-divergence-free condition, is $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J} = 0$. In a magnetized plasma, it is convenient to separate the dynamics parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field $\\boldsymbol{B}$. The current continuity equation becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\parallel} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J}_{\\parallel} + \\nabla_{\\perp} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J}_{\\perp} = 0\n$$\nIn the drift-wave ordering, the parallel current is dominated by the highly mobile electrons, so $\\boldsymbol{J}_{\\parallel} \\approx \\boldsymbol{J}_{e,\\parallel}$. The perpendicular current has contributions from both ions and electrons. An essential simplification in drift-wave models is that the divergence of the perpendicular current is dominated by the ion polarization current. Thus, the governing equation for quasi-neutrality becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\parallel} J_{e,\\parallel} + \\nabla_{\\perp} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J}_{i,pol} = 0\n$$\nWe will now derive expressions for each term.\n\nFirst, we address the electron response. The problem states that electrons are isothermal with temperature $T_e$ and respond adiabatically along magnetic field lines. This implies that for low-frequency phenomena, the electrons remain in Boltzmann equilibrium along the field lines. The parallel component of the electron momentum equation, neglecting electron inertia, is:\n$$\n0 \\approx -e n_e E_{\\parallel} - \\nabla_{\\parallel} p_e\n$$\nwhere $n_e$ is the electron density, $p_e = n_e T_e$ is the electron pressure, and $E_{\\parallel} = -\\nabla_{\\parallel} \\phi$ is the parallel electric field. Substituting these and linearizing for small fluctuations (i.e., $n_e = n_0 + \\tilde{n}_e$ where $n_0$ is the uniform background density) yields:\n$$\ne n_0 \\nabla_{\\parallel} \\phi - T_e \\nabla_{\\parallel} \\tilde{n}_e = 0\n$$\nIntegrating along the field line gives the adiabatic electron density response:\n$$\n\\tilde{n}_e = \\frac{e n_0}{T_e} \\phi\n$$\nThe divergence of the parallel electron current, $\\nabla_{\\parallel} J_{e,\\parallel}$, is found from the electron continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n_e}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (n_e \\boldsymbol{v}_e) = 0\n$$\nLinearizing this equation gives $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{n}_e}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (n_0 \\boldsymbol{v}_e) = 0$. The electron velocity is $\\boldsymbol{v}_e = \\boldsymbol{v}_{e,\\perp} + v_{e,\\parallel} \\boldsymbol{b}$. The perpendicular velocity is dominated by the $\\boldsymbol{E} \\times \\boldsymbol{B}$ drift, $\\boldsymbol{v}_{e,\\perp} \\approx \\boldsymbol{v}_E = -\\frac{\\nabla_{\\perp} \\phi \\times \\boldsymbol{B}}{B^2}$.

We start from the perpendicular ion momentum equation. In the drift approximation, the perpendicular ion velocity $\\boldsymbol{v}_{i,\\perp}$ is found by solving the momentum equation iteratively. The lowest order velocity is the $\\boldsymbol{E} \\times \\boldsymbol{B}$ drift, $\\boldsymbol{v}_E = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{E} \\times \\boldsymbol{B}}{B^2}$. The next order correction due to ion inertia gives the polarization drift, $\\boldsymbol{v}_{pol}$. The ion momentum equation is $m_i \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{v}_i}{dt} = e(\\boldsymbol{E} + \\boldsymbol{v}_i \\times \\boldsymbol{B})$. The polarization velocity is the velocity required to balance the inertial force: $e(\\boldsymbol{v}_{pol} \\times \\boldsymbol{B}) \\approx m_i \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{v}_{lowest-order}}{dt}$. Approximating $\\boldsymbol{v}_{lowest-order} \\approx \\boldsymbol{v}_E$:\n$$\nm_i \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{v}_E}{dt} \\approx e(\\boldsymbol{v}_{pol} \\times \\boldsymbol{B})\n$$\nSolving for $\\boldsymbol{v}_{pol}$ by taking the cross product with $\\boldsymbol{B}$ gives $\\boldsymbol{v}_{pol} = \\frac{m_i}{eB^2} \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\perp}}{dt}$.\nUsing the electrostatic approximation $\\boldsymbol{E} = -\\nabla\\phi$ and linearizing the total time derivative $\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\nabla$ to just the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ (consistent with finding the leading-order linear response), we get:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{v}_{pol} \\approx \\frac{m_i}{eB^2} \\frac{\\partial (-\\nabla_{\\perp}\\phi)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{m_i}{eB^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\nabla_{\\perp}\\phi\n$$\nThe ion polarization current is $\\boldsymbol{J}_{i,pol} = e n_i \\boldsymbol{v}_{pol}$.

            "solution": "The problem is to find the steady-state plasma density profile $n(x,y)$ governed by the drift-reduced Braginskii continuity equation in a slab geometry. The analysis begins with the provided governing equation, the continuity balance, under a steady-state condition, $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n\nThe steady-state continuity equation is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\left(n\\,\\mathbf{v}\\right) = S(x,y) - \\frac{n}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the fluid velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is dominated by the $E \\times B$ drift, so we take $\\mathbf{v} \\approx \\mathbf{v}_{E}$. The $E \\times B$ drift velocity is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{E} = \\frac{-\\nabla\\phi \\times \\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\n$$\nThe magnetic field is uniform, $\\mathbf{B} = B\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, and the electrostatic potential is given as $\\phi(x) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\,x^{2}$. First, we compute the gradient of the potential:\n$$\n\\nabla \\phi = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\alpha x\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mathbf{v}_{E}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{E} = \\frac{-(\\alpha x\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) \\times (B\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})}{B^2} = \\frac{-\\alpha x B (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})}{B^2} = \\frac{-\\alpha x B (-\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})}{B^2} = \\frac{\\alpha x}{B}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\nThe velocity field is thus a sheared flow purely in the $y$-direction, with magnitude $v_y(x) = \\frac{\\alpha x}{B}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the advection term, $\\nabla \\cdot (n\\,\\mathbf{v}_{E})$.\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (n\\,\\mathbf{v}_{E}) = \\nabla \\cdot \\left(n(x,y) \\frac{\\alpha x}{B}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left(n(x,y) \\frac{\\alpha x}{B}\\right)\n$$\nSince $x$ is independent of $y$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (n\\,\\mathbf{v}_{E}) = \\frac{\\alpha x}{B} \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial y}\n$$\nSubstituting this term and the given source function $S(x,y) = S_{0}\\,x\\,\\cos(k\\,y)$ back into the steady-state continuity equation, we obtain a first-order linear partial differential equation for $n(x,y)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha x}{B} \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial y} + \\frac{n}{\\tau} = S_{0}\\,x\\,\\cos(k\\,y)\n$$\nThis equation is an ordinary differential equation in the variable $y$ for any fixed value of $x$. Given the sinusoidal source term and the requirement of periodicity in $y$, we can solve this equation efficiently using complex phasors. Let's represent the density $n(x,y)$ and source term as the real parts of complex-valued functions:\n$$\nn(x,y) = \\text{Re}\\{\\tilde{n}(x) e^{i k y}\\} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad S_0 x \\cos(k y) = \\text{Re}\\{S_0 x e^{i k y}\\}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the PDE, the derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ becomes multiplication by $i k$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha x}{B} (i k \\tilde{n}) + \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\tilde{n} = S_0 x\n$$\nWe can now solve for the complex amplitude $\\tilde{n}(x)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{n} \\left( \\frac{i k \\alpha x}{B} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\right) = S_0 x\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{n} \\left( \\frac{i k \\alpha \\tau x + B}{B \\tau} \\right) = S_0 x\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{n}(x) = \\frac{S_0 x B \\tau}{B + i k \\alpha \\tau x}\n$$\nTo find the real and imaginary parts of $\\tilde{n}(x)$, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is $B - i k \\alpha \\tau x$:\n$$\n\\tilde{n}(x) = \\frac{S_0 x B \\tau}{B + i k \\alpha \\tau x} \\cdot \\frac{B - i k \\alpha \\tau x}{B - i k \\alpha \\tau x} = \\frac{S_0 x B \\tau (B - i k \\alpha \\tau x)}{B^{2} + (k \\alpha \\tau x)^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{n}(x) = \\frac{S_0 B^{2} \\tau x}{B^{2} + (k \\tau \\alpha x)^{2}} - i \\frac{S_0 B \\tau^2 k \\alpha x^2}{B^{2} + (k \\tau \\alpha x)^{2}}\n$$\nThe real-valued density profile $n(x,y)$ is recovered by taking the real part of $\\tilde{n}(x) e^{i k y}$:\n$$\nn(x,y) = \\text{Re}\\{\\tilde{n}(x) (\\cos(k y) + i \\sin(k y))\\} = \\text{Re}\\{\\tilde{n}(x)\\} \\cos(k y) - \\text{Im}\\{\\tilde{n}(x)\\} \\sin(k y)\n$$\nSubstituting the real and imaginary parts of $\\tilde{n}(x)$:\n$$\nn(x,y) = \\left( \\frac{S_0 B^{2} \\tau x}{B^{2} + (k \\tau \\alpha x)^{2}} \\right) \\cos(k y) - \\left( - \\frac{S_0 B k \\alpha \\tau^2 x^2}{B^{2} + (k \\tau \\alpha x)^{2}} \\right) \\sin(k y)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the density profile:\n$$\nn(x,y) = \\frac{S_0 B^{2} \\tau x \\cos(k y) + S_0 B k \\alpha \\tau^2 x^2 \\sin(k y)}{B^{2} + (k \\tau \\alpha x)^{2}}\n$$\nThis solution is periodic in $y$ as required. We must also check for boundedness as $x \\to 0$. As $x \\to 0$, the numerator terms are proportional to $x$ and $x^2$ respectively, while the denominator approaches a non-zero constant $B^2$. Thus, $n(x,y) \\to 0$ as $x \\to 0$, satisfying the boundedness condition.\n\nThe expression can be written more compactly as:\n$$\nn(x,y) = \\frac{S_{0} \\tau B x \\left( B \\cos(k y) + k \\tau \\alpha x \\sin(k y) \\right)}{B^{2} + (k \\tau \\alpha x)^{2}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the steady-state density.",
