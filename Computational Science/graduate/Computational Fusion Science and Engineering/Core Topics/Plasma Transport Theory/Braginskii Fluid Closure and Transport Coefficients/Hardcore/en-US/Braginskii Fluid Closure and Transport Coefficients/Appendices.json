It is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical plasma physics, specifically the theory of binary collisions in a weakly coupled plasma. The definitions provided for the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$, and the plasma parameter, $\\Lambda$, are standard approximations within this regime. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary constants and parameters for a unique, verifiable solution.

Derivation of a closed-form expression for the Coulomb logarithm, $\\ln\\Lambda$, in terms of electron density $n_e$, electron temperature $T_e$, and fundamental constants.\n2.  Numerical evaluation of $\\ln\\Lambda$ for specified fusion plasma parameters.\n3.  Discussion of the sensitivity of $\\ln\\Lambda$ to variations in $n_e$ and $T_e$.\n\nWe will address these sequentially.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Expression for $\\ln\\Lambda$**\n\nWe begin with the provided definitions. The Debye length, $\\lambda_D$, is given by:\n$$\n\\lambda_{D} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0} T_{e}}{n_{e} e^{2}}}\n$$\nwhere $T_e$ is the electron temperature in Joules, $n_e$ is the electron density, $\\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThe plasma parameter, $\\Lambda$, is given by the relation:\n$$\n\\Lambda = 12\\pi n_{e}\\lambda_{D}^{3}\n$$\nThis relation is a specific definition for the purpose of this problem, representing $9$ times the number of particles in a Debye sphere ($N_D = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi n_e \\lambda_D^3$). We treat this as an exact equality for the derivation.\n\nWe substitute the expression for $\\lambda_D$ into the expression for $\\Lambda$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = 12\\pi n_{e} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0} T_{e}}{n_{e} e^{2}}} \\right)^{3} = 12\\pi n_{e} \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_{0} T_{e}}{n_{e} e^{2}} \\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nWe distribute the exponent $3/2$ to the terms inside the parenthesis:\n$$\n\\Lambda = 12\\pi n_{e} \\frac{(\\varepsilon_{0} T_{e})^{3/2}}{(n_{e} e^{2})^{3/2}} = 12\\pi n_{e} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}^{3/2} T_{e}^{3/2}}{n_{e}^{3/2} (e^2)^{3/2}} = 12\\pi n_{e} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}^{3/2} T_{e}^{3/2}}{n_{e}^{3/2} e^{3}}\n$$\nCombining the terms with $n_e$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = 12\\pi \\frac{n_{e}}{n_{e}^{3/2}} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}^{3/2} T_{e}^{3/2}}{e^{3}} = 12\\pi n_{e}^{-1/2} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}^{3/2} T_{e}^{3/2}}{e^{3}}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to group constants and variables:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\left( \\frac{12\\pi \\varepsilon_{0}^{3/2}}{e^{3}} \\right) \\frac{T_{e}^{3/2}}{n_{e}^{1/2}}\n$$\nThe Coulomb logarithm, $\\ln\\Lambda$, is the natural logarithm of this expression:\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda = \\ln\\left[ \\left( \\frac{12\\pi \\varepsilon_{0}^{3/2}}{e^{3}} \\right) \\frac{T_{e}^{3/2}}{n_{e}^{1/2}} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can write this in its fully expanded form:\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda = \\ln(12\\pi) + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(\\varepsilon_{0}) - 3\\ln(e) + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(T_{e}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(n_{e})\n$$\nThis is the desired closed-form expression for $\\ln\\Lambda$.\n\n**2. Numerical Evaluation of $\\ln\\Lambda$**\n\nWe are given the following parameters for a fusion plasma:\n- Electron density, $n_{e} = 1.00 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- Electron temperature, $T_{e} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}$\n\nAnd the fundamental constants:\n- Permittivity of free space, $\\varepsilon_{0} = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$\n- Elementary charge, $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- Energy conversion, $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$\n\nFirst, we must convert the electron temperature $T_e$ from kilo-electron-volts ($\\mathrm{keV}$) to Joules ($\\mathrm{J}$) to be consistent with the SI units used in the definition of $\\lambda_D$.\n$$\nT_{e} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{keV} = 10.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n$$\nT_{e} = (1.00 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J/eV}) = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n$$\nNow we can substitute all the values into the derived expression for $\\Lambda$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\left( \\frac{12\\pi (8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12})^{3/2}}{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19})^{3}} \\right) \\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-15})^{3/2}}{(1.00 \\times 10^{19})^{1/2}}\n$$\nLet's calculate the value of $\\Lambda$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\frac{12\\pi (8.8541878128)^{3/2} \\times 10^{-18} \\times (1.602176634)^{3/2} \\times 10^{-22.5}}{(1.602176634)^{3} \\times 10^{-57} \\times (1.00)^{1/2} \\times 10^{9.5}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\frac{12\\pi (26.3351) \\times 10^{-18} \\times (2.0293) \\times 10^{-22.5}}{(4.1129) \\times 10^{-57} \\times (1.00) \\times 10^{9.5}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda \\approx \\frac{2014.2 \\times 10^{-40.5}}{4.1129 \\times 10^{-47.5}} \\approx 489.74 \\times 10^{7} = 4.8974 \\times 10^{9}\n$$\nA more precise calculation to avoid intermediate rounding errors gives $\\Lambda \\approx 4.89999 \\times 10^{9}$.\n\nNow, we compute the natural logarithm of $\\Lambda$:\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda = \\ln(4.89999 \\times 10^{9})\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda \\approx 22.31248\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda \\approx 22.31\n$$\n\n**3. Sensitivity of $\\ln\\Lambda$ to $n_e$ and $T_e$**\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is based on the derived expression:\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda = \\left[ \\ln(12\\pi) + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(\\varepsilon_{0}) - 3\\ln(e) \\right] + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(T_{e}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(n_{e})\n$$\nThe term in the square brackets is a constant. Let's call it $C_0$.\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda = C_0 + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(T_{e}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(n_{e})\n$$\nThis expression directly reveals how $\\ln\\Lambda$ scales with temperature and density.\n\n-   **Scaling with Temperature ($T_e$)**: The term $\\frac{3}{2}\\ln(T_{e})$ shows that $\\ln\\Lambda$ increases with temperature. Specifically, the plasma parameter $\\Lambda$ itself scales as $\\Lambda \\propto T_{e}^{3/2}$. Because of the logarithm, $\\ln\\Lambda$ is a very slowly varying function of $T_e$. For instance, doubling the temperature from $10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ to $20\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ would add a term $\\frac{3}{2}\\ln(2) \\approx 1.04$ to the value of $\\ln\\Lambda$, a relatively small change from its value of $\\approx 22.31$.\n\n-   **Scaling with Density ($n_e$)**: The term $-\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(n_{e})$ shows that $\\ln\\Lambda$ decreases as density increases. The plasma parameter $\\Lambda$ scales as $\\Lambda \\propto n_{e}^{-1/2}$. Again, the dependence is logarithmic and weak. Doubling the density from $1.00 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ to $2.00 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ would subtract a term $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2) \\approx 0.35$ from $\\ln\\Lambda$, an even smaller change.\n\nIn summary, the Coulomb logarithm $\\ln\\Lambda$ exhibits a weak, logarithmic dependence on both plasma density and temperature. It increases with temperature and decreases with density. This weak dependence is a cornerstone of transport theory in weakly coupled plasmas, implying that transport coefficients such as resistivity and thermal conductivity, which are often proportional to $1/\\ln\\Lambda$, are not highly sensitive to plasma parameter variations over wide ranges. This robustness simplifies modeling efforts in fields like fusion energy science.",

The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe elasticity $S_C$ is defined as $S_C \\equiv \\frac{\\ln\\Lambda}{C}\\,\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial \\ln\\Lambda}$. This can be equivalently expressed as the derivative of $\\ln C$ with respect to $\\ln(\\ln\\Lambda)$. If a coefficient $C$ has a power-law dependence on the Coulomb logarithm of the form $C \\propto (\\ln\\Lambda)^{\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant exponent, then the elasticity is simply this exponent:\n$$\nS_C = \\frac{\\ln\\Lambda}{A(\\ln\\Lambda)^{\\alpha}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln\\Lambda} \\left( A(\\ln\\Lambda)^{\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{\\ln\\Lambda}{A(\\ln\\Lambda)^{\\alpha}} A\\alpha(\\ln\\Lambda)^{\\alpha-1} = \\alpha\n$$\nOur task reduces to determining the exponent $\\alpha$ for each transport coefficient.\n\nThe foundation of classical transport theory is the Coulomb collision frequency, $\\nu$. For any pair of colliding species, the collision frequency in a plasma is directly proportional to the Coulomb logarithm, $\\ln\\Lambda$. All other factors affecting the collision frequency (density $n$, temperature $T$, masses $m$, charges $Ze$) are held constant as per the problem statement. Therefore, for any relevant collision frequency $\\nu$ (e.g., electron-ion $\\nu_{ei}$, ion-ion $\\nu_{ii}$), the scaling is:\n$$\n\\nu \\propto \\ln\\Lambda\n$$\n\nWe now analyze each transport coefficient based on its physical origin in the strongly magnetized limit.\n\n**1. Electron parallel electrical conductivity, $\\sigma_{e\\parallel}$**\nParallel electrical conductivity relates the parallel electric field $E_{\\parallel}$ to the parallel current density $j_{\\parallel}$ via $j_{\\parallel} = \\sigma_{e\\parallel} E_{\\parallel}$. The current is carried by electrons moving along magnetic field lines. This motion is impeded by momentum-transferring collisions, primarily with ions. In a simple Drude model, conductivity is inversely proportional to the collision frequency: $\\sigma \\propto 1/\\nu$. The detailed Braginskii derivation confirms this scaling for parallel transport.\n$$\n\\sigma_{e\\parallel} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\nu_{ei}}\n$$\nSince $\\nu_{ei} \\propto \\ln\\Lambda$, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma_{e\\parallel} \\propto (\\ln\\Lambda)^{-1}\n$$\nThe exponent is $\\alpha = -1$, so $S_{\\sigma_{e\\parallel}} = -1$.\n\n**2. Electron parallel thermal conductivity, $\\kappa_{e\\parallel}$**\nParallel thermal conductivity describes heat flux along the magnetic field lines driven by a parallel temperature gradient. This transport of thermal energy is also limited by collisions that scatter the energy-carrying electrons. Thus, similar to electrical conductivity, the parallel thermal conductivity is inversely proportional to the relevant collision frequency.\n$$\n\\kappa_{e\\parallel} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\nu_{ei}}\n$$\nThis gives the scaling:\n$$\n\\kappa_{e\\parallel} \\propto (\\ln\\Lambda)^{-1}\n$$\nThe exponent is $\\alpha = -1$, so $S_{\\kappa_{e\\parallel}} = -1$.\n\n**3. Ion parallel viscosity, $\\mu_{i\\parallel}$**\nParallel viscosity describes the diffusive transport of fluid momentum parallel to the magnetic field. This process is dominated by ion-ion collisions, as ions carry the bulk of the plasma momentum. The viscosity coefficient is proportional to the plasma pressure and the collision time, $\\tau_{ii} = 1/\\nu_{ii}$.\n$$\n\\mu_{i\\parallel} \\propto n_i T_i \\tau_{ii} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\nu_{ii}}\n$$\nWith $\\nu_{ii} \\propto \\ln\\Lambda$, the scaling is:\n$$\n\\mu_{i\\parallel} \\propto (\\ln\\Lambda)^{-1}\n$$\nThe exponent is $\\alpha = -1$, so $S_{\\mu_{i\\parallel}} = -1$.\n\n**4. Classical cross-field particle diffusivity for electrons, $D_{e\\perp}$**\nIn the strongly magnetized limit ($\\omega_{ce} \\gg \\nu_{ei}$ where $\\omega_{ce}$ is the electron cyclotron frequency), transport perpendicular to the magnetic field is not a simple free-streaming process. Instead, it is a random walk where particles are confined to gyrate around field lines. A collision causes the guiding center of the particle's gyromotion to take a random step. The step size is of the order of the Larmor radius, $\\rho_e$, and the frequency of steps is the collision frequency, $\\nu_{ei}$. The perpendicular diffusion coefficient scales as:\n$$\nD_{e\\perp} \\propto \\rho_e^2 \\nu_{ei}\n$$\nThe Larmor radius, $\\rho_e = \\frac{m_e v_{th,e}}{eB}$, depends on temperature and magnetic field strength, which are held constant. It does not depend on $\\ln\\Lambda$. Therefore, the entire dependence on $\\ln\\Lambda$ comes from the collision frequency.\n$$\nD_{e\\perp} \\propto \\nu_{ei} \\propto (\\ln\\Lambda)^{1}\n$$\nThe exponent is $\\alpha = 1$, so $S_{D_{e\\perp}} = 1$.\n\n**5. Electron parallel resistivity, $\\eta_{\\parallel}$**\nThe problem defines $\\eta_{\\parallel} \\equiv 1/\\sigma_{e\\parallel}$. Using our result for $\\sigma_{e\\parallel}$:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\parallel} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{e\\parallel}} \\propto \\frac{1}{(\\ln\\Lambda)^{-1}} = (\\ln\\Lambda)^{1}\n$$\nThe exponent is $\\alpha = 1$, so $S_{\\eta_{\\parallel}} = 1$.\nAlternatively, using the properties of the elasticity operator:\n$$\nS_{\\eta_{\\parallel}} = S_{1/\\sigma_{e\\parallel}} = \\frac{\\ln\\Lambda}{1/\\sigma_{e\\parallel}} \\frac{\\partial (1/\\sigma_{e\\parallel})}{\\partial \\ln\\Lambda} = \\sigma_{e\\parallel} \\ln\\Lambda \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{e\\parallel}^2} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{e\\parallel}}{\\partial \\ln\\Lambda} \\right) = - \\left( \\frac{\\ln\\Lambda}{\\sigma_{e\\parallel}} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{e\\parallel}}{\\partial \\ln\\Lambda} \\right) = -S_{\\sigma_{e\\parallel}} = -(-1) = 1\n$$\n\n### Justification for the Range of $\\ln\\Lambda$\nThe Coulomb logarithm is defined as $\\ln\\Lambda = \\ln(\\lambda_D / b_0)$, where $\\lambda_D$ is the Debye length and $b_0$ is the impact parameter for a $90$-degree collision. The scaling is approximately $\\Lambda \\propto T^{3/2} n^{-1/2}$.\n- **Core of a fusion plasma:** Temperatures are high ($T \\sim 10-20 \\text{ keV}$) and densities are high ($n \\sim 10^{20} \\text{ m}^{-3}$). For typical parameters ($T_e=10 \\text{ keV}, n_e=10^{20} \\text{ m}^{-3}$), $\\Lambda \\approx 5 \\times 10^8$, which gives $\\ln\\Lambda \\approx 20$. The typical range is $17 \\le \\ln\\Lambda \\le 21$. This is on the order of $10^1$.\n- **Edge of a fusion plasma:** Temperatures are lower ($T \\sim 10-100 \\text{ eV}$) and densities are lower ($n \\sim 10^{18}-10^{19} \\text{ m}^{-3}$). For typical parameters ($T_e=50 \\text{ eV}, n_e=10^{19} \\text{ m}^{-3}$), $\\Lambda \\approx 5 \\times 10^5$, which gives $\\ln\\Lambda \\approx 13$. The typical range is $10 \\le \\ln\\Lambda \\le 15$. This is also on the order of $10^1$.\nDespite orders-of-magnitude changes in $T$ and $n$, $\\ln\\Lambda$ is a very slowly varying parameter, typically ranging between $10$ and $20$.\n\n### Summary of Elasticities\n- $S_{\\sigma_{e\\parallel}} = -1$\n- $S_{\\kappa_{e\\parallel}} = -1$\n- $S_{\\mu_{i\\parallel}} = -1$\n- $S_{D_{e\\perp}} = 1$\n- $S_{\\eta_{\\parallel}} = 1$\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix of these values.",

            "solution": "The user-provided problem is evaluated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in plasma physics and computational methods, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and free from any of the invalidating flaws outlined in the instructions. The problem requires the derivation, implementation, and analysis of an anisotropic diffusion operator, which is a standard topic in computational science and engineering.\n\nThe solution is structured according to the five tasks specified in the problem statement. All mathematical entities are rendered in LaTeX as required.\n\n### Task 1: Eigenstructure of the Symmetric Conductivity Tensor\n\nThe problem states that the symmetric part of the Braginskii thermal conductivity tensor, which we denote as $\\mathbf{K}$, is a constant, symmetric, positive-definite tensor with one distinguished direction, the magnetic field unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$. It is also specified to be invariant under rotations about $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$. Let $\\mathbf{R}$ be a rotation matrix that leaves $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$ invariant, i.e., $\\mathbf{R}\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$. The invariance property states that $\\mathbf{K}$ is unchanged by such a rotation, meaning $\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{R}^T = \\mathbf{K}$.\n\nAccording to the representation theorem for isotropic tensor functions, any second-rank tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ that depends on a single vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$ and satisfies these symmetry and invariance properties can be expressed in the general form:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} = c_1 \\mathbf{I} + c_2 (\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity tensor, $\\otimes$ denotes the outer product, and $c_1$ and $c_2$ are scalar constants. This form guarantees symmetry since both $\\mathbf{I}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$ are symmetric.\n\nWe can determine the physical meaning of $c_1$ and $c_2$ by examining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{K}$.\nFirst, consider an eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$ parallel to the distinguished direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$, so $\\mathbf{v} = \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$. Applying the tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = (c_1 \\mathbf{I} + c_2 (\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}))\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = c_1 \\mathbf{I}\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} + c_2 \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}) = c_1 \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} + c_2 \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}(1) = (c_1 + c_2)\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}\n$$\nThus, $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\parallel} = c_1 + c_2$. This eigenvalue corresponds to the thermal conductivity parallel to the magnetic field, which is given as $\\kappa_{\\parallel}$. So, $\\kappa_{\\parallel} = c_1 + c_2$.\n\nNext, consider an eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$ that is perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$, so $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = 0$. Applying the tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{v} = (c_1 \\mathbf{I} + c_2 (\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}))\\mathbf{v} = c_1 \\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{v} + c_2 \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) = c_1 \\mathbf{v} + c_2 \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}(0) = c_1 \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nThus, any vector in the plane perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\perp} = c_1$. This eigenvalue is degenerate, corresponding to the thermal conductivity perpendicular to the magnetic field, $\\kappa_{\\perp}$. So, $\\kappa_{\\perp} = c_1$.\n\nFrom these relations, we find the scalar coefficients: $c_1 = \\kappa_{\\perp}$ and $c_2 = \\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp}$. The tensor can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} = \\kappa_{\\perp} \\mathbf{I} + (\\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp})(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}})\n$$\nThe positive-definiteness of $\\mathbf{K}$ requires that all its eigenvalues are positive, which means $\\kappa_{\\parallel} > 0$ and $\\kappa_{\\perp} > 0$. In magnetized plasmas, typically $\\kappa_{\\parallel} \\gg \\kappa_{\\perp}$.\n\nThe eigenstructure of the symmetric conductivity tensor is as follows:\n-   **Eigenvalues**: The tensor has two distinct eigenvalues. The first is $\\kappa_{\\parallel}$ (conductivity parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$) and the second is $\\kappa_{\\perp}$ (conductivity perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$) with a multiplicity of two. In ascending order, the eigenvalues are $[\\kappa_{\\perp}, \\kappa_{\\perp}, \\kappa_{\\parallel}]$, all in units of $\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n-   **Eigenvectors**: The eigenvector corresponding to $\\kappa_{\\parallel}$ is the magnetic field unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$. The eigenspace corresponding to $\\kappa_{\\perp}$ is the two-dimensional plane orthogonal to $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$. Any two mutually orthogonal unit vectors spanning this plane can be chosen as the other two eigenvectors.\n\n### Task 2: 2D Conductivity Tensor Construction\n\nThe problem restricts the domain to a $2$D $(x,y)$ plane. The magnetic field unit vector is given by $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)^T$. We construct the $2 \\times 2$ conductivity tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ using the derived form. The outer product $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos^2\\theta & \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta & \\sin^2\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nUsing the formula $\\mathbf{K} = \\kappa_{\\perp} \\mathbf{I} + (\\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp})(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}})$ in $2$D:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\kappa_{\\perp} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\kappa_{\\perp} \\end{pmatrix} + (\\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp}) \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos^2\\theta & \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta & \\sin^2\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of the tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ are:\n$$\nK_{xx} = \\kappa_{\\perp} + (\\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp})\\cos^2\\theta = \\kappa_{\\parallel}\\cos^2\\theta + \\kappa_{\\perp}\\sin^2\\theta\n$$\n$$\nK_{yy} = \\kappa_{\\perp} + (\\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp})\\sin^2\\theta = \\kappa_{\\parallel}\\sin^2\\theta + \\kappa_{\\perp}\\cos^2\\theta\n$$\n$$\nK_{xy} = K_{yx} = (\\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp})\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta\n$$\n\n### Task 3: Closed-Form Expression for $\\mathcal{L}[T]$\n\nThe anisotropic diffusion operator is $\\mathcal{L}[T] = -\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{K}\\,\\nabla T)$. Since $\\mathbf{K}$ is a constant tensor, this expands to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[T] = -\\nabla \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} K_{xx}\\partial_x T + K_{xy}\\partial_y T \\\\ K_{yx}\\partial_x T + K_{yy}\\partial_y T \\end{pmatrix} = - \\left( \\partial_x(K_{xx}\\partial_x T + K_{xy}\\partial_y T) + \\partial_y(K_{yx}\\partial_x T + K_{yy}\\partial_y T) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[T] = - ( K_{xx}\\partial_{xx}T + K_{xy}\\partial_{xy}T + K_{yx}\\partial_{yx}T + K_{yy}\\partial_{yy}T )\n$$\nSince $K_{xy} = K_{yx}$ and for a sufficiently smooth function $T$, $\\partial_{xy}T = \\partial_{yx}T$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[T] = -( K_{xx}\\partial_{xx}T + K_{yy}\\partial_{yy}T + 2K_{xy}\\partial_{xy}T )\n$$\nThe given manufactured temperature field is $T(x,y) = \\sin(\\alpha x)\\sin(\\beta y)$ with $\\alpha = 2\\pi m/L$ and $\\beta = 2\\pi n/L$. Its partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\partial_{x}T = \\alpha\\cos(\\alpha x)\\sin(\\beta y), \\quad \\partial_{y}T = \\beta\\sin(\\alpha x)\\cos(\\beta y)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_{xx}T = -\\alpha^2\\sin(\\alpha x)\\sin(\\beta y) = -\\alpha^2 T\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_{yy}T = -\\beta^2\\sin(\\alpha x)\\sin(\\beta y) = -\\beta^2 T\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_{xy}T = \\alpha\\beta\\cos(\\alpha x)\\cos(\\beta y)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\mathcal{L}[T]$ gives the final closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[T](x,y) = -( K_{xx}(-\\alpha^2 T) + K_{yy}(-\\beta^2 T) + 2K_{xy}(\\alpha\\beta\\cos(\\alpha x)\\cos(\\beta y)) )\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[T](x,y) = (K_{xx}\\alpha^2 + K_{yy}\\beta^2)\\sin(\\alpha x)\\sin(\\beta y) - 2K_{xy}\\alpha\\beta\\cos(\\alpha x)\\cos(\\beta y)\n$$\n\n### Task 4 & 5: Discretization Error Analysis\n\nThe naive discretization is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{naive}}[T] \\approx -(K_{xx}\\,\\partial_{xx}T + K_{yy}\\,\\partial_{yy}T)$, where the derivatives are approximated by second-order central finite differences. An essential insight is that the chosen temperature field $T(x,y)$ is a Fourier mode. The discrete second derivative operator is diagonal in the Fourier basis.\nOn a grid with points $x_i = i h$ where $h=L/N$, the discrete second derivative operator $D_{xx}$ acts on $T$ as:\n$$\n(D_{xx}T)_i = \\frac{T_{i+1}-2T_i+T_{i-1}}{h^2} \\implies D_{xx} \\sin(\\alpha x_i) = \\frac{2(\\cos(\\alpha h)-1)}{h^2} \\sin(\\alpha x_i) \\equiv \\lambda_k \\sin(\\alpha x_i)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_k$ is the eigenvalue of the discrete operator for mode $k$. Here, $\\alpha h = 2\\pi m / N$.\nLet $\\lambda_x = \\frac{2(\\cos(2\\pi m/N)-1)}{(L/N)^2}$ and $\\lambda_y = \\frac{2(\\cos(2\\pi n/N)-1)}{(L/N)^2}$ be the eigenvalues for the discrete Laplacians in $x$ and $y$ respectively. The discrete naive operator applied to the grid function $T_{ij} = T(x_i, y_j)$ is:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{naive}}[T])_{ij} = -(K_{xx}\\lambda_x + K_{yy}\\lambda_y) T_{ij}\n$$\nLet's define the scalar multipliers:\n$A = -(K_{xx}\\lambda_x + K_{yy}\\lambda_y)$\n$B = K_{xx}\\alpha^2 + K_{yy}\\beta^2$\n$C = -2K_{xy}\\alpha\\beta$\nLet $T_{\\text{grid}} = \\sin(\\alpha x)\\sin(\\beta y)$ and $C_{\\text{grid}} = \\cos(\\alpha x)\\cos(\\beta y)$ evaluated on the grid. Then:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{naive}}[T] = A \\cdot T_{\\text{grid}}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[T] = B \\cdot T_{\\text{grid}} + C \\cdot C_{\\text{grid}}\n$$\nThe error is calculated from the difference grid $\\mathcal{D}_{ij} = (\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{naive}}[T])_{ij} - (\\mathcal{L}[T])_{ij}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D} = (A-B) \\cdot T_{\\text{grid}} - C \\cdot C_{\\text{grid}}\n$$\nThe functions $\\sin(\\alpha x_i)$ and $\\cos(\\alpha x_i)$ are orthogonal on the discrete grid for the given parameters, meaning $\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\sin(\\alpha x_i)\\cos(\\alpha x_i) = 0$. This implies $\\sum_{i,j} (T_{\\text{grid}})_{ij} (C_{\\text{grid}})_{ij} = 0$.\nThe mean square values are:\n$\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i,j} T_{ij}^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i,j} C_{ij}^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{4}$ for large $N$.\nThe RMS error is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum \\mathcal{D}_{ij}^2}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum (\\mathcal{L}[T])_{ij}^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{((A-B)^2/4) + (C^2/4)}}{\\sqrt{(B^2/4) + (C^2/4)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(A-B)^2 + C^2}{B^2 + C^2}}\n$$\nThis analytical expression for $\\varepsilon$ avoids numerical summation over the grid, providing a highly accurate result. The term $A-B$ represents the finite difference discretization error, which scales as $h^2 = (L/N)^2$. The term $C$ represents the model error from neglecting the mixed derivative, which is proportional to $K_{xy}$. When $K_{xy} \\neq 0$, the model error $C$ dominates the discretization error $A-B$, and the total error $\\varepsilon$ becomes largely insensitive to the grid size $N$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this derived formula to compute the eigenvalues and the error $\\varepsilon$ for each test case.",
