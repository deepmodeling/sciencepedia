Discussion of the sensitivity of $\\ln\\Lambda$ to variations in $n_e$ and $T_e$.\n\nWe will address these sequentially.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Expression for $\\ln\\Lambda$**\n\nWe begin with the provided definitions. The Debye length, $\\lambda_D$, is given by:\n$$\n\\lambda_{D} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0} T_{e}}{n_{e} e^{2}}}\n$$\nwhere $T_e$ is the electron temperature in Joules, $n_e$ is the electron density, $\\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThe plasma parameter, $\\Lambda$, is given by the relation:\n$$\n\\Lambda = 12\\pi n_{e}\\lambda_{D}^{3}\n$$\nThis relation is a specific definition for the purpose of this problem, representing $9$ times the number of particles in a Debye sphere ($N_D = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi n_e \\lambda_D^3$). We treat this as an exact equality for the derivation.\n\nWe substitute the expression for $\\lambda_D$ into the expression for $\\Lambda$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = 12\\pi n_{e} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0} T_{e}}{n_{e} e^{2}}} \\right)^{3} = 12\\pi n_{e} \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_{0} T_{e}}{n_{e} e^{2}} \\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nWe distribute the exponent $3/2$ to the terms inside the parenthesis:\n$$\n\\Lambda = 12\\pi n_{e} \\frac{(\\varepsilon_{0} T_{e})^{3/2}}{(n_{e} e^{2})^{3/2}} = 12\\pi n_{e} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}^{3/2} T_{e}^{3/2}}{n_{e}^{3/2} (e^2)^{3/2}} = 12\\pi n_{e} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}^{3/2} T_{e}^{3/2}}{n_{e}^{3/2} e^{3}}\n$$\nCombining the terms with $n_e$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = 12\\pi \\frac{n_{e}}{n_{e}^{3/2}} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}^{3/2} T_{e}^{3/2}}{e^{3}} = 12\\pi n_{e}^{-1/2} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}^{3/2} T_{e}^{3/2}}{e^{3}}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to group constants and variables:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\left( \\frac{12\\pi \\varepsilon_{0}^{3/2}}{e^{3}} \\right) \\frac{T_{e}^{3/2}}{n_{e}^{1/2}}\n$$\nThe Coulomb logarithm, $\\ln\\Lambda$, is the natural logarithm of this expression:\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda = \\ln\\left[ \\left( \\frac{12\\pi \\varepsilon_{0}^{3/2}}{e^{3}} \\right) \\frac{T_{e}^{3/2}}{n_{e}^{1/2}} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can write this in its fully expanded form:\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda = \\ln(12\\pi) + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(\\varepsilon_{0}) - 3\\ln(e) + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(T_{e}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(n_{e})\n$$\nThis is the desired closed-form expression for $\\ln\\Lambda$.\n\n**2. Numerical Evaluation of $\\ln\\Lambda$**\n\nWe are given the following parameters for a fusion plasma:\n- Electron density, $n_{e} = 1.00 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- Electron temperature, $T_{e} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}$\n\nAnd the fundamental constants:\n- Permittivity of free space, $\\varepsilon_{0} = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$\n- Elementary charge, $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- Energy conversion, $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$\n\nFirst, we must convert the electron temperature $T_e$ from kilo-electron-volts ($\\mathrm{keV}$) to Joules ($\\mathrm{J}$) to be consistent with the SI units used in the definition of $\\lambda_D$.\n$$\nT_{e} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{keV} = 10.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n$$\nT_{e} = (1.00 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J/eV}) = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n$$\nNow we can substitute all the values into the derived expression for $\\Lambda$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\left( \\frac{12\\pi (8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12})^{3/2}}{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19})^{3}} \\right) \\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-15})^{3/2}}{(1.00 \\times 10^{19})^{1/2}}\n$$\nLet's calculate the value of $\\Lambda$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\frac{12\\pi (8.8541878128)^{3/2} \\times 10^{-18} \\times (1.602176634)^{3/2} \\times 10^{-22.5}}{(1.602176634)^{3} \\times 10^{-57} \\times (1.00)^{1/2} \\times 10^{9.5}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\frac{12\\pi (26.3351) \\times 10^{-18} \\times (2.0293) \\times 10^{-22.5}}{(4.1129) \\times 10^{-57} \\times (1.00) \\times 10^{9.5}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda \\approx \\frac{2014.2 \\times 10^{-40.5}}{4.1129 \\times 10^{-47.5}} \\approx 489.74 \\times 10^{7} = 4.8974 \\times 10^{9}\n$$\nA more precise calculation to avoid intermediate rounding errors gives $\\Lambda \\approx 4.89999 \\times 10^{9}$.\n\nNow, we compute the natural logarithm of $\\Lambda$:\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda = \\ln(4.89999 \\times 10^{9})\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda \\approx 22.31248\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda \\approx 22.31\n$$\n\n**3. Sensitivity of $\\ln\\Lambda$ to $n_e$ and $T_e$**\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is based on the derived expression:\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda = \\left[ \\ln(12\\pi) + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(\\varepsilon_{0}) - 3\\ln(e) \\right] + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(T_{e}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(n_{e})\n$$\nThe term in the square brackets is a constant. Let's call it $C_0$.\n$$\n\\ln\\Lambda = C_0 + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(T_{e}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(n_{e})\n$$\nThis expression directly reveals how $\\ln\\Lambda$ scales with temperature and density.\n\n-   **Scaling with Temperature ($T_e$)**: The term $\\frac{3}{2}\\ln(T_{e})$ shows that $\\ln\\Lambda$ increases with temperature. Specifically, the plasma parameter $\\Lambda$ itself scales as $\\Lambda \\propto T_{e}^{3/2}$. Because of the logarithm, $\\ln\\Lambda$ is a very slowly varying function of $T_e$. For instance, doubling the temperature from $10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ to $20\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ would add a term $\\frac{3}{2}\\ln(2) \\approx 1.04$ to the value of $\\ln\\Lambda$, a relatively small change from its value of $\\approx 22.31$.\n\n-   **Scaling with Density ($n_e$)**: The term $-\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(n_{e})$ shows that $\\ln\\Lambda$ decreases as density increases. The plasma parameter $\\Lambda$ scales as $\\Lambda \\propto n_{e}^{-1/2}$. Again, the dependence is logarithmic and weak. Doubling the density from $1.00 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ to $2.00 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ would subtract a term $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2) \\approx 0.35$ from $\\ln\\Lambda$, an even smaller change.\n\nIn summary, the Coulomb logarithm $\\ln\\Lambda$ exhibits a weak, logarithmic dependence on both plasma density and temperature. It increases with temperature and decreases with density. This weak dependence is a cornerstone of transport theory in weakly coupled plasmas, implying that transport coefficients such as resistivity and thermal conductivity, which are often proportional to $1/\\ln\\Lambda$, are not highly sensitive to plasma parameter variations over wide ranges. This robustness simplifies modeling efforts in fields like fusion energy science.",

Applying the tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = (c_1 \\mathbf{I} + c_2 (\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}))\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = c_1 \\mathbf{I}\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} + c_2 \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}) = c_1 \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} + c_2 \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}(1) = (c_1 + c_2)\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}\n$$\nThus, $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\parallel} = c_1 + c_2$. This eigenvalue corresponds to the thermal conductivity parallel to the magnetic field, which is given as $\\kappa_{\\parallel}$. So, $\\kappa_{\\parallel} = c_1 + c_2$.\n\nNext, consider an eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$ that is perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$, so $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = 0$. Applying the tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{v} = (c_1 \\mathbf{I} + c_2 (\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}))\\mathbf{v} = c_1 \\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{v} + c_2 \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) = c_1 \\mathbf{v} + c_2 \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}(0) = c_1 \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nThus, any vector in the plane perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\perp} = c_1$. This eigenvalue is degenerate, corresponding to the thermal conductivity perpendicular to the magnetic field, $\\kappa_{\\perp}$. So, $\\kappa_{\\perp} = c_1$.\n\nFrom these relations, we find the scalar coefficients: $c_1 = \\kappa_{\\perp}$ and $c_2 = \\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp}$. The tensor can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} = \\kappa_{\\perp} \\mathbf{I} + (\\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp})(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}})\n$$\nThe positive-definiteness of $\\mathbf{K}$ requires that all its eigenvalues are positive, which means $\\kappa_{\\parallel} > 0$ and $\\kappa_{\\perp} > 0$. In magnetized plasmas, typically $\\kappa_{\\parallel} \\gg \\kappa_{\\perp}$.\n\nThe eigenstructure of the symmetric conductivity tensor is as follows:\n-   **Eigenvalues**: The tensor has two distinct eigenvalues. The first is $\\kappa_{\\parallel}$ (conductivity parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$) and the second is $\\kappa_{\\perp}$ (conductivity perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$) with a multiplicity of two. In ascending order, the eigenvalues are $[\\kappa_{\\perp}, \\kappa_{\\perp}, \\kappa_{\\parallel}]$, all in units of $\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n-   **Eigenvectors**: The eigenvector corresponding to $\\kappa_{\\parallel}$ is the magnetic field unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$. The eigenspace corresponding to $\\kappa_{\\perp}$ is the two-dimensional plane orthogonal to $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$. Any two mutually orthogonal unit vectors spanning this plane can be chosen as the other two eigenvectors.\n\n### Task 2: 2D Conductivity Tensor Construction\n\nThe problem restricts the domain to a $2$D $(x,y)$ plane. The magnetic field unit vector is given by $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)^T$. We construct the $2 \\times 2$ conductivity tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ using the derived form. The outer product $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos^2\\theta & \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta & \\sin^2\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nUsing the formula $\\mathbf{K} = \\kappa_{\\perp} \\mathbf{I} + (\\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp})(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{b}})$ in $2$D:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\kappa_{\\perp} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\kappa_{\\perp} \\end{pmatrix} + (\\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp}) \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos^2\\theta & \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta & \\sin^2\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of the tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ are:\n$$\nK_{xx} = \\kappa_{\\perp} + (\\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp})\\cos^2\\theta = \\kappa_{\\parallel}\\cos^2\\theta + \\kappa_{\\perp}\\sin^2\\theta\n$$\n$$\nK_{yy} = \\kappa_{\\perp} + (\\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp})\\sin^2\\theta = \\kappa_{\\parallel}\\sin^2\\theta + \\kappa_{\\perp}\\cos^2\\theta\n$$\n$$\nK_{xy} = K_{yx} = (\\kappa_{\\parallel} - \\kappa_{\\perp})\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta\n$$\n\n### Task 3: Closed-Form Expression for $\\mathcal{L}[T]$\n\nThe anisotropic diffusion operator is $\\mathcal{L}[T] = -\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{K}\\,\\nabla T)$. Since $\\mathbf{K}$ is a constant tensor, this expands to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[T] = -\\nabla \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} K_{xx}\\partial_x T + K_{xy}\\partial_y T \\\\ K_{yx}\\partial_x T + K_{yy}\\partial_y T \\end{pmatrix} = - \\left( \\partial_x(K_{xx}\\partial_x T + K_{xy}\\partial_y T) + \\partial_y(K_{yx}\\partial_x T + K_{yy}\\partial_y T) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[T] = - ( K_{xx}\\partial_{xx}T + K_{xy}\\partial_{xy}T + K_{yx}\\partial_{yx}T + K_{yy}\\partial_{yy}T )\n$$\nSince $K_{xy} = K_{yx}$ and for a sufficiently smooth function $T$, $\\partial_{xy}T = \\partial_{yx}T$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[T] = -( K_{xx}\\partial_{xx}T + K_{yy}\\partial_{yy}T + 2K_{xy}\\partial_{xy}T )\n$$\nThe given manufactured temperature field is $T(x,y) = \\sin(\\alpha x)\\sin(\\beta y)$ with $\\alpha = 2\\pi m/L$ and $\\beta = 2\\pi n/L$. Its partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\partial_{x}T = \\alpha\\cos(\\alpha x)\\sin(\\beta y), \\quad \\partial_{y}T = \\beta\\sin(\\alpha x)\\cos(\\beta y)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_{xx}T = -\\alpha^2\\sin(\\alpha x)\\sin(\\beta y) = -\\alpha^2 T\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_{yy}T = -\\beta^2\\sin(\\alpha x)\\sin(\\beta y) = -\\beta^2 T\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_{xy}T = \\alpha\\beta\\cos(\\alpha x)\\cos(\\beta y)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\mathcal{L}[T]$ gives the final closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[T](x,y) = -( K_{xx}(-\\alpha^2 T) + K_{yy}(-\\beta^2 T) + 2K_{xy}(\\alpha\\beta\\cos(\\alpha x)\\cos(\\beta y)) )\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[T](x,y) = (K_{xx}\\alpha^2 + K_{yy}\\beta^2)\\sin(\\alpha x)\\sin(\\beta y) - 2K_{xy}\\alpha\\beta\\cos(\\alpha x)\\cos(\\beta y)\n$$\n\n### Task 4 & 5: Discretization Error Analysis\n\nThe naive discretization is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{naive}}[T] \\approx -(K_{xx}\\,\\partial_{xx}T + K_{yy}\\,\\partial_{yy}T)$, where the derivatives are approximated by second-order central finite differences. An essential insight is that the chosen temperature field $T(x,y)$ is a Fourier mode. The discrete second derivative operator is diagonal in the Fourier basis.\nOn a grid with points $x_i = i h$ where $h=L/N$, the discrete second derivative operator $D_{xx}$ acts on $T$ as:\n$$\n(D_{xx}T)_i = \\frac{T_{i+1}-2T_i+T_{i-1}}{h^2} \\implies D_{xx} \\sin(\\alpha x_i) = \\frac{2(\\cos(\\alpha h)-1)}{h^2} \\sin(\\alpha x_i) \\equiv \\lambda_k \\sin(\\alpha x_i)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_k$ is the eigenvalue of the discrete operator for mode $k$. Here, $\\alpha h = 2\\pi m / N$.\nLet $\\lambda_x = \\frac{2(\\cos(2\\pi m/N)-1)}{(L/N)^2}$ and $\\lambda_y = \\frac{2(\\cos(2\\pi n/N)-1)}{(L/N)^2}$ be the eigenvalues for the discrete Laplacians in $x$ and $y$ respectively. The discrete naive operator applied to the grid function $T_{ij} = T(x_i, y_j)$ is:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{naive}}[T])_{ij} = -(K_{xx}\\lambda_x + K_{yy}\\lambda_y) T_{ij}\n$$\nLet's define the scalar multipliers:\n$A = -(K_{xx}\\lambda_x + K_{yy}\\lambda_y)$\n$B = K_{xx}\\alpha^2 + K_{yy}\\beta^2$\n$C = -2K_{xy}\\alpha\\beta$\nLet $T_{grid} = \\sin(\\alpha x)\\sin(\\beta y)$ and $C_{grid} = \\cos(\\alpha x)\\cos(\\beta y)$ evaluated on the grid. Then:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{naive}}[T] = A \\cdot T_{grid}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[T] = B \\cdot T_{grid} + C \\cdot C_{grid}\n$$\nThe error is calculated from the difference grid $\\mathcal{D}_{ij} = (\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{naive}}[T])_{ij} - (\\mathcal{L}[T])_{ij}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D} = (A-B) \\cdot T_{grid} - C \\cdot C_{grid}\n$$\nThe functions $\\sin(\\alpha x_i)$ and $\\cos(\\alpha x_i)$ are orthogonal on the discrete grid for the given parameters, meaning $\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\sin(\\alpha x_i)\\cos(\\alpha x_i) = 0$. This implies $\\sum_{i,j} (T_{grid})_{ij} (C_{grid})_{ij} = 0$.\nThe mean square values are:\n$\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i,j} T_{ij}^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i,j} C_{ij}^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{4}$ for large $N$.\nThe RMS error is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum \\mathcal{D}_{ij}^2}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum (\\mathcal{L}[T])_{ij}^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{((A-B)^2/4) + (C^2/4)}}{\\sqrt{(B^2/4) + (C^2/4)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(A-B)^2 + C^2}{B^2 + C^2}}\n$$\nThis analytical expression for $\\varepsilon$ avoids numerical summation over the grid, providing a highly accurate result. The term $A-B$ represents the finite difference discretization error, which scales as $h^2 = (L/N)^2$. The term $C$ represents the model error from neglecting the mixed derivative, which is proportional to $K_{xy}$. When $K_{xy} \\neq 0$, the model error $C$ dominates the discretization error $A-B$, and the total error $\\varepsilon$ becomes largely insensitive to the grid size $N$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this derived formula to compute the eigenvalues and the error $\\varepsilon$ for each test case.",
