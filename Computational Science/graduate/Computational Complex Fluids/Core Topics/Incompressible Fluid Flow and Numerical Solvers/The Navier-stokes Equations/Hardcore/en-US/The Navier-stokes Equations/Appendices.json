It accurately describes a standard problem in numerical fluid mechanics. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. We may proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe core of a Chorin-type fractional-step method is to decouple the enforcement of the incompressibility constraint from the rest of the momentum equation update. This is done in two conceptual steps for a time step from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1}$.\n\n1.  **Prediction Step:** An intermediate velocity field, $\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}$, is computed by advancing the momentum equation over the time step $\\Delta t$, but explicitly omitting the pressure gradient term. The semi-discretized momentum equation is:\n    $$ \\rho\\frac{\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} - \\mathbf{u}^{n}}{\\Delta t} = \\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{u}^n, \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}) - \\nabla p^{n+1} $$\n    where $\\mathcal{F}$ represents the collected convection and diffusion terms. The prediction step isolates these terms:\n    $$ \\rho\\frac{\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} - \\mathbf{u}^{n}}{\\Delta t} = \\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{u}^n, \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}) $$\n    Generally, $\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}$ will not be divergence-free, i.e., $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} \\neq 0$.\n\n2.  **Projection Step:** The intermediate velocity is corrected to obtain the final, divergence-free velocity $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$. This step introduces the-yet-unknown pressure $p^{n+1}$. By comparing the two equations above, we find the relationship between the three fields $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$, $\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}$, and $p^{n+1}$:\n    $$ \\rho\\frac{\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} - \\mathbf{u}^{n}}{\\Delta t} = \\rho\\frac{\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} - \\mathbf{u}^{n}}{\\Delta t} - \\nabla p^{n+1} $$\n    Simplifying this equation yields the velocity correction formula:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}}{\\Delta t} - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla p^{n+1} $$\n    $$ \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho}\\nabla p^{n+1} $$\n    This is the third required element.\n\nNext, we derive the elliptic equation for the pressure-like scalar $p^{n+1}$. The problem mandates that the final velocity field be divergence-free: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = 0$. We enforce this by taking the divergence of the velocity correction equation:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho}\\nabla p^{n+1}\\right) $$\nSetting $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = 0$ and noting that $\\rho$ and $\\Delta t$ are constants:\n$$ 0 = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla p^{n+1}) $$\nUsing the identity $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\phi) = \\Delta \\phi$ (the Laplacian), we get:\n$$ 0 = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\Delta p^{n+1} $$\nRearranging this gives the pressure-Poisson equation:\n$$ \\Delta p^{n+1} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\Delta t} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} $$\nThis is the first required element.\n\nFinally, we derive the boundary condition for $p^{n+1}$ on the solid walls $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{w}}$. The problem mandates the no-penetration condition: $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = 0$ on $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{w}}$. We enforce this by taking the dot product of the velocity correction equation with the outward unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho}\\nabla p^{n+1}\\right) $$\nApplying the no-penetration condition and distributing the dot product gives:\n$$ 0 = \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla p^{n+1}) $$\nThe term $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla p^{n+1}$ is, by definition, the normal derivative of $p^{n+1}$, denoted as $\\frac{\\partial p^{n+1}}{\\partial n}$. Thus:\n$$ 0 = \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial p^{n+1}}{\\partial n} $$\nRearranging to solve for the boundary condition on $p^{n+1}$ yields a Neumann boundary condition:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p^{n+1}}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\Delta t} (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}) $$\nThis is the second required element.\n\nThe complete and correct set of equations is therefore:\n-   Elliptic equation: $\\Delta p^{n+1} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\Delta t} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}$\n-   Boundary condition: $\\frac{\\partial p^{n+1}}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\Delta t} \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}$\n-   Velocity correction: $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\nabla p^{n+1}$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\,\\Delta p^{n+1}=\\dfrac{\\rho}{\\Delta t}\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}\\,$ in $\\,\\Omega\\,$, $\\,\\dfrac{\\partial p^{n+1}}{\\partial n}=\\dfrac{\\rho}{\\Delta t}\\,\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}\\,$ on $\\,\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{w}}\\,$, and $\\,\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}=\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}-\\dfrac{\\Delta t}{\\rho}\\,\\nabla p^{n+1}\\,$.**\n-   This option matches our derived elliptic equation, boundary condition, and velocity correction formula exactly.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $\\,\\Delta p^{n+1}=\\dfrac{1}{\\Delta t}\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}\\,$ in $\\,\\Omega\\,$, $\\,\\dfrac{\\partial p^{n+1}}{\\partial n}=\\dfrac{1}{\\Delta t}\\,\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}\\,$ on $\\,\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{w}}\\,$, and $\\,\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}=\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}-\\Delta t\\,\\nabla p^{n+1}\\,$.**\n-   This option omits the density $\\rho$ from all three components.

Since the goal is to make $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = 0$, this would imply $\\Delta p^{n+1} = 0$ (Laplace's equation), which is incorrect.
