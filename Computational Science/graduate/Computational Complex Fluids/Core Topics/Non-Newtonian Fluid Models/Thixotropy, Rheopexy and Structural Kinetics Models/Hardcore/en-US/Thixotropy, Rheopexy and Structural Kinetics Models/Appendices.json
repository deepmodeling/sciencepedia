The apparent viscosity is determined by a monotonically increasing function $\\eta(\\lambda)$, and the shear stress in simple shear is $\\tau=\\eta(\\lambda)\\,\\dot{\\gamma}$, where $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the scalar shear rate. For thixotropic and rheopectic materials, structural kinetics are often modeled by rate equations of the form $\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt}=\\mathcal{B}(\\dot{\\gamma},\\lambda)-\\mathcal{D}(\\dot{\\gamma},\\lambda)$, where $\\mathcal{B}$ denotes structure build-up and $\\mathcal{D}$ denotes structure breakdown.

It is a standard exercise in solving a first-order linear ODE with piecewise-constant coefficients, relevant to the field of complex fluids. The solution process can proceed.\n\nThe derivation of $\\lambda(T+\\Delta)$ is performed in two stages, corresponding to the two parts of the shear protocol.\n\n**Stage 1: Shear Application ($0 \\le t \\le T$)**\n\nDuring this interval, a constant shear rate $|\\dot{\\gamma}| = |\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|$ is applied. The governing ODE is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} = k_{b}(1-\\lambda) - k_{d}\\lambda|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, which can be rearranged into the standard form $\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} + P(t)\\lambda = Q(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} + (k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|)\\lambda = k_{b}\n$$\nThe general solution is the sum of a particular solution, $\\lambda_p$, and a homogeneous solution, $\\lambda_h$. The particular solution for this constant-coefficient equation is the steady-state value, $\\lambda_{ss}$, obtained by setting $\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt}=0$:\n$$\n0 = k_{b} - (k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|)\\lambda_{ss} \\implies \\lambda_{ss} = \\frac{k_{b}}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|}\n$$\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{d\\lambda_h}{dt} + (k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|)\\lambda_h = 0$, which has the solution $\\lambda_h(t) = C_1 \\exp\\left(-(k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|)t\\right)$, where $C_1$ is an integration constant.\nThe general solution for $\\lambda(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\lambda(t) = \\lambda_{ss} + C_1 \\exp\\left(-(k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|)t\\right) = \\frac{k_{b}}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|} + C_1 \\exp\\left(-(k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|)t\\right)\n$$\nThe constant $C_1$ is determined from the initial condition $\\lambda(0)=1$:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{k_{b}}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|} + C_1 \\implies C_1 = 1 - \\frac{k_{b}}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|} = \\frac{k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|}\n$$\nThus, the solution for the structural parameter during the shear phase is:\n$$\n\\lambda(t) = \\frac{k_{b}}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|} + \\frac{k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|} \\exp\\left(-(k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|)t\\right)\n$$\nAt the end of this stage, at time $t=T$, the structural parameter is:\n$$\n\\lambda(T) = \\frac{k_{b}}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|} + \\frac{k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|}{k_{b} + k_d|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|} \\exp\\left(-(k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|)T\\right)\n$$\n\n**Stage 2: Quiescent Recovery ($T < t \\le T+\\Delta$)**\n\nDuring this interval, the shear is ceased, so $|\\dot{\\gamma}|=0$. The governing ODE simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} = k_{b}(1-\\lambda)\n$$\nTo solve this, we define a new time variable $t' = t - T$, which runs from $0$ to $\\Delta$. The ODE is $\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt'} = k_{b}(1-\\lambda)$. This is a separable first-order ODE. The general solution describes relaxation towards the equilibrium value $\\lambda=1$:\n$$\n\\lambda(t') = 1 - C_2 \\exp(-k_b t')\n$$\nThe constant $C_2$ is determined by the initial condition for this stage, which is the value of $\\lambda$ at the end of Stage 1, i.e., $\\lambda(t'=0) = \\lambda(T)$.\n$$\n\\lambda(T) = 1 - C_2 \\exp(0) \\implies C_2 = 1 - \\lambda(T)\n$$\nSo, the solution for the recovery phase is:\n$$\n\\lambda(t') = 1 - (1 - \\lambda(T))\\exp(-k_b t')\n$$\nWe need to find the value at the end of the entire protocol, which corresponds to $t = T+\\Delta$, or $t'=\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\lambda(T+\\Delta) = 1 - (1 - \\lambda(T))\\exp(-k_b \\Delta)\n$$\n\n**Final Assembly**\n\nTo obtain the final expression, we substitute the result for $\\lambda(T)$ from Stage 1 into the equation for $\\lambda(T+\\Delta)$. First, we compute the term $(1 - \\lambda(T))$:\n$$\n1 - \\lambda(T) = 1 - \\left( \\frac{k_{b}}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|} + \\frac{k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|} \\exp\\left(-(k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|)T\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n1 - \\lambda(T) = \\frac{(k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|) - k_b}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|} - \\frac{k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|} \\exp\\left(-(k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|)T\\right)\n$$\n$$\n1 - \\lambda(T) = \\frac{k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-(k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|)T\\right) \\right)\n$$\nNow, substituting this into the expression for $\\lambda(T+\\Delta)$:\n$$\n\\lambda(T+\\Delta) = 1 - \\left[ \\frac{k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|}{k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-(k_{b} + k_{d}|\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}|)T\\right) \\right) \\right] \\exp(-k_b \\Delta)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the structural parameter at the end of the prescribed protocol.",
