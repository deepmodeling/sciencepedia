The functional is the standard Ginzburg-Landau free energy, and the double-well potential is canonical for phase separation models. The problem is well-posed, as finding the equilibrium profile is a classic problem in the calculus of variations. The boundary conditions are consistent with the minima of the potential energy $f(c)$, which occur at $c=\\pm 1$. The problem is objective, complete, consistent, and contains no ambiguities. The problem is valid.\n\nThe equilibrium profile $c(x)$ extremizes the functional $\\mathcal{F}[c]$. According to the calculus of variations, such a profile must satisfy the Euler–Lagrange equation. The Lagrangian density is $\\mathcal{L}(c, c') = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} (c')^2 + f(c)$, where $c' = dc/dx$.

The time derivative of the total solute mass $C(t) = \\int_\\Omega c(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\, dV$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = -\\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = -\\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} (-M(c)\\nabla\\mu) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} M(c) (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla\\mu) \\, dS $$\nThe problem states the boundary condition $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla\\mu = 0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$. Substituting this into the boundary integral:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} M(c) (0) \\, dS = 0 $$\nThus, the total solute mass is conserved. The condition $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla\\mu = 0$ is precisely the no-flux condition $\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0$. The additional condition $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla c = 0$ is a natural boundary condition associated with a free energy functional without surface energy terms, but it is the condition on $\\mu$ that ensures mass conservation.\n\nThe statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. In an Allen–Cahn setting for $\\eta(\\mathbf{x},t)$ with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition $\\,\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\nabla \\eta = 0\\,$ on $\\partial \\Omega$, the spatial average $\\frac{1}{|\\Omega|}\\int_\\Omega \\eta(\\mathbf{x},t)\\, \\mathrm{d}V$ is conserved in time.**\n\nThe governing equation is $\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = -L \\mu_\\eta$. The conservation of the spatial average is equivalent to the conservation of the total integral $H(t) = \\int_\\Omega \\eta(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\, dV$. The time derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = \\int_\\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} \\, dV = -L \\int_\\Omega \\mu_\\eta \\, dV $$\nIn general, the chemical potential $\\mu_\\eta = \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\eta}$ is not identically zero, nor is its integral over the domain. For a typical Ginzburg-Landau functional $F = \\int_\\Omega (f(\\eta) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2} |\\nabla\\eta|^2) \\, dV$, the chemical potential is $\\mu_\\eta = f'(\\eta) - \\kappa \\nabla^2\\eta$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = -L \\int_\\Omega (f'(\\eta) - \\kappa \\nabla^2\\eta) \\, dV = -L \\left( \\int_\\Omega f'(\\eta) \\, dV - \\kappa \\int_\\Omega \\nabla^2\\eta \\, dV \\right) $$\nUsing the divergence theorem, $\\int_\\Omega \\nabla^2\\eta \\, dV = \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla\\eta \\, dS$. The homogeneous Neumann boundary condition $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla\\eta = 0$ makes this boundary integral zero. However, the first term remains:\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = -L \\int_\\Omega f'(\\eta) \\, dV $$\nThis term is generally non-zero. For example, in a system undergoing ordering from a disordered state, $\\eta$ will change in a way that lowers the total free energy, and the integral of $f'(\\eta)$ will not be zero. The Allen-Cahn equation models non-conserved dynamics, so the integral of $\\eta$ is not expected to be conserved.\n\nThe statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In a single-component Cahn–Hilliard setting for $c(\\mathbf{x},t)$ with $M(c)  0$, if the boundary condition prescribes a constant chemical potential $\\mu = \\mu_b$ on $\\partial \\Omega$ and additionally $\\,\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\nabla c = 0\\,$, then $\\int_\\Omega c(\\mathbf{x},t)\\, \\mathrm{d}V$ is conserved in time.**\n\nAs derived for statement A, the rate of change of mass is $\\frac{dC}{dt} = \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} M(c) (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla\\mu) \\, dS$. The boundary condition is $\\mu = \\mu_b$ (a constant) on $\\partial\\Omega$. This does not imply that the normal derivative of the chemical potential, $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla\\mu$, is zero. In fact, a constant chemical potential boundary condition models an open system in contact with a large external reservoir at potential $\\mu_b$. If the chemical potential inside the domain near the boundary is different from $\\mu_b$, a gradient $\\nabla\\mu$ will exist, generally with a non-zero normal component $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla\\mu \\neq 0$. This will lead to a flux of matter across the boundary and thus a change in the total mass $\\int_\\Omega c \\, dV$.\n\nThe statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. In a multicomponent Cahn–Hilliard setting with $N$ components, $\\,\\mathbf{J}_i = - \\sum_{j=1}^N M_{ij}(c)\\, \\nabla \\mu_j\\,$, $\\,\\partial_t c_i = - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_i\\,$, and boundary conditions $\\,\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_i = 0\\,$ for all $i$ on $\\partial \\Omega$, each individual component mass $\\int_\\Omega c_i(\\mathbf{x},t)\\, \\mathrm{d}V$ is conserved in time, as is the total $\\int_\\Omega \\sum_{i=1}^N c_i(\\mathbf{x},t)\\, \\mathrm{d}V$.**\n\nFor each component $i$, the dynamics are given by a conservation law $\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_i$. The rate of change of the total mass of component $i$, $C_i(t) = \\int_\\Omega c_i \\, dV$, is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dC_i}{dt} = \\int_\\Omega (-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_i) \\, dV = -\\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{J}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS $$\nThe stated boundary condition is $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_i = 0$ for all $i$. This directly implies that the boundary integral is zero for each component:\n$$ \\frac{dC_i}{dt} = 0 $$\nThus, the mass of each individual component, $\\int_\\Omega c_i \\, dV$, is conserved.\nFor the total, we are given the algebraic constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^N c_i = 1$. The integral of this sum is:\n$$ \\int_\\Omega \\sum_{i=1}^N c_i(\\mathbf{x},t)\\, \\mathrm{d}V = \\int_\\Omega 1 \\, dV = |\\Omega| $$\nThe volume of the domain $|\\Omega|$ is constant. Therefore, the total integral is trivially conserved. Both parts of the statement are true.\n\nThe statement is **Correct**.\n\n**E. In a single-component Cahn–Hilliard setting with composition-dependent mobility $M(c)$ and periodic boundary conditions on $\\partial \\Omega$, the total solute mass $\\int_\\Omega c(\\mathbf{x},t)\\, \\mathrm{d}V$ can change in time because $M(c)$ depends on $c$.**\n\nAs before, the rate of change of the total mass $C(t)$ is given by the net flux out of the domain:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = -\\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS $$\nPeriodic boundary conditions mean that the domain has the topology of a torus. For a rectangular domain, this implies that for any function $f$, its values on opposite faces are equal. The integral over the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ comprises integrals over pairs of opposing faces. For a pair of faces, say at $x = x_{min}$ and $x = x_{max}$, the outward unit normals are opposite ($\\mathbf{n}_{min} = -\\mathbf{n}_{max}$). The flux $\\mathbf{J}$ is periodic, so its value at a point on one face is the same as its value at the corresponding point on the opposite face. The sum of integrals over this pair of faces is zero due to the opposite normals. Since this applies to all pairs of opposing faces, the total boundary integral is zero: $\\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = 0$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{dC}{dt}=0$, and the total mass is conserved. This result is independent of the form of the mobility $M(c)$. The composition dependence of the mobility affects the local dynamics but not the global conservation in a closed system.\n\nThe statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. In an Allen–Cahn setting for $\\eta(\\mathbf{x},t)$ with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition $\\,\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\nabla \\eta = 0\\,$, if the kinetic equation is modified by adding a spatially uniform, time-dependent Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda(t)$ to enforce a global constraint, i.e., $\\partial_t \\eta = -L\\big(\\mu_\\eta - \\lambda(t)\\big)$, then one can choose $\\lambda(t)$ so that $\\int_\\Omega \\eta(\\mathbf{x},t)\\, \\mathrm{d}V$ is conserved in time.**\n\nThe goal is to have the total integrated order parameter, $H(t) = \\int_\\Omega \\eta \\, dV$, be conserved, which means $\\frac{dH}{dt}=0$. The time derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = \\int_\\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} \\, dV = \\int_\\Omega -L(\\mu_\\eta - \\lambda(t)) \\, dV $$\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = -L \\int_\\Omega \\mu_\\eta \\, dV + L\\int_\\Omega \\lambda(t) \\, dV $$\nSince $\\lambda(t)$ is spatially uniform, it can be taken out of the integral:\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = -L \\int_\\Omega \\mu_\\eta \\, dV + L \\lambda(t) |\\Omega| $$\nTo enforce conservation, we set $\\frac{dH}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ -L \\int_\\Omega \\mu_\\eta \\, dV + L \\lambda(t) |\\Omega| = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\lambda(t)$ (since $L0$ and $|\\Omega|0$):\n$$ \\lambda(t) = \\frac{1}{|\\Omega|} \\int_\\Omega \\mu_\\eta(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\, dV $$\nAt any time $t$, given the field $\\eta(\\mathbf{x}, t)$, the chemical potential $\\mu_\\eta(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ is determined, and its spatial average can be computed. By choosing $\\lambda(t)$ to be this average, we can ensure that $\\frac{dH}{dt}=0$. This is a standard method to enforce conservation on a non-conserved dynamic. The Neumann boundary condition is consistent with this formulation but not strictly necessary for the argument itself.\n\nThe statement is **Correct**.",
