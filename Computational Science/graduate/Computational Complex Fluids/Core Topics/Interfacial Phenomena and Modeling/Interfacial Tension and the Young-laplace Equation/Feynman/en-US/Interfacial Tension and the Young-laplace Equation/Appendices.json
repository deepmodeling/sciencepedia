In the absence of flow and body forces, the mechanical equilibrium imposes a balance between the internal pressure of the droplet and the external pressure of the ambient fluid mediated by interfacial tension. For a spherical interface, the mean curvature depends on the reciprocal of the radius. From first principles, the pressure jump across the interface must scale linearly with the appropriate geometric curvature measure. This linear relationship can be used to infer the interfacial tension by regressing the measured pressure jump against the curvature for a range of radii, and then assessing convergence as the computational grid is refined.\n\nYour task is to implement a program that, given measured pressure jumps at several droplet radii from three numerical experiments at different grid spacings, performs an unweighted least-squares linear regression of the pressure jump against the reciprocal radius, deduces the interfacial tension from the proportionality factor implied by spherical geometry, and quantifies the quality of the fit.
