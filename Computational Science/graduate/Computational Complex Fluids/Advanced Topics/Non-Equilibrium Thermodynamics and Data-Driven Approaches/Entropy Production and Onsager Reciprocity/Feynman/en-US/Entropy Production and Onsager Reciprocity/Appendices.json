The dynamics is modeled as a continuous-time Markov jump process with nearest-neighbor transitions. Let $\\rho$ denote the mean occupancy per lattice site (assumed uniform), and let $w$ be a baseline jump rate in the absence of driving. Near a reference steady state, introduce two small, dimensionless thermodynamic forces $\\mathbf{X}=(X_x,X_y)$ conjugate to particle transport along the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively, so that the entropy production rate can be written at linear order as $\\sigma=J_x X_x+J_y X_y$, where $J_x$ and $J_y$ are the coarse-grained particle currents along $x$ and $y$. \n\nTo model a nonholonomic rolling constraint that breaks microscopic time-reversal symmetry, assume that the transition rates acquire a chiral cross-coupling proportional to a parameter $\\beta$ such that moves parallel to one force are biased to produce perpendicular steps. Specifically, suppose the right/left and up/down transition rates take the form\n$$\nw_{x}^{+}=w\\left(1+\\alpha X_x+\\beta X_y\\right),\\quad w_{x}^{-}=w\\left(1-\\alpha X_x-\\beta X_y\\right),\n$$\n$$\nw_{y}^{+}=w\\left(1+\\alpha X_y-\\beta X_x\\right),\\quad w_{y}^{-}=w\\left(1-\\alpha X_y+\\beta X_x\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha>0$ quantifies the dissipative response that would be present under microscopic reversibility and $\\beta\\neq 0$ quantifies the strength of the nonholonomic, chiral coupling that breaks time-reversal symmetry.

A $2 \\times 2$ symmetric matrix is positive semidefinite if and only if its trace and determinant are non-negative. More stringently, for positive definiteness, the leading principal minors must be positive.\n1. The first principal minor is $L_{11} = 3$. Since $3 > 0$, this condition is met.\n2. The second principal minor is the determinant of $\\mathbf{L}$:\n   $$\n   \\det(\\mathbf{L}) = L_{11}L_{22} - L_{12}^2 = (3)(2) - (1)^2 = 6 - 1 = 5\n   $$\n   Since $5 > 0$, this condition is also met.\nBoth principal minors are positive, so the matrix $\\mathbf{L}$ is positive definite, which implies it is also positive semidefinite.\nSince the unconstrained minimizer lies within the feasible region defined by the constraints, it is the unique global solution to the convex optimization problem.\nThe entries of the Onsager matrix are $L_{11} = 3$, $L_{12} = 1$, and $L_{22} = 2$.",
