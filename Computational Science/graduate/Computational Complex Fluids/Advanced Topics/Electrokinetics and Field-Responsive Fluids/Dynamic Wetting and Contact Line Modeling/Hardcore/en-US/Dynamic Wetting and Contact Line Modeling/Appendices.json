            "problem": "A two-dimensional, isothermal, incompressible Newtonian liquid of viscosity $\\mu$ and surface tension $\\sigma$ advances with a steady contact-line speed $U$ over a smooth solid substrate. The flow is in the creeping-flow limit and obeys the Stokes equations. The solid imposes the Navier slip boundary condition (NSBC): the tangential velocity at the wall is proportional to the tangential viscous traction, with slip length $b$. The free surface is shear-free, and the normal stress jump across the interface is balanced by surface tension times the local curvature. The macroscopic dynamic contact angle measured at a far-field outer scale $L$ is $\\theta_{d}$, and the equilibrium contact angle is $\\theta_{e}$. Assume small angles, negligible gravity, no Marangoni effects, and a slowly varying wedge near the contact line. Using only first principles (Stokes equations, NSBC, and capillary normal-stress balance) and matched asymptotics between an inner slip-dominated region of size $b$ and an outer capillary-viscous region up to $L$, derive a leading-order analytic expression for the steady contact-line speed $U$ in terms of $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, $\\theta_{d}$, $\\theta_{e}$, $b$, and $L$.

It describes a canonical problem in the physics of fluids: the moving contact line paradox and its resolution. The paradox arises from the infinite stress predicted at a moving contact line when a no-slip boundary condition is applied. The problem introduces a standard regularization method, the Navier slip boundary condition, which is a physically motivated model where the fluid can slip over a microscopic length scale $b$.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It asks for the derivation of the relationship between the contact line velocity and the apparent contact angle, a classic result known as the Cox-Voinov law. The use of matched asymptotic expansion between an inner (slip-dominated) and an outer (viscous-capillary) region is the standard and correct theoretical tool for this problem. All necessary parameters are provided, and their values are physically reasonable (e.g., $L \\gg b$, $\\theta_d > \\theta_e$ for an advancing line).\n\nThe problem is objective and formalizable. The governing equations (Stokes) and boundary conditions (Navier slip, capillary stress balance) are stated clearly and are mathematically precise. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms. The assumptions (small angles, creeping flow, etc.) are standard simplifications that make an analytical solution tractable.\n\nThe problem is neither trivial nor tautological; it requires a correct application of advanced fluid dynamics principles (lubrication theory, matched asymptotics). It does not violate any scientific principles and is a staple of graduate-level fluid mechanics courses.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem requires deriving the relationship between the contact line speed $U$ and the system parameters using matched asymptotic expansions. This is a classic analysis that resolves the moving contact-line singularity. We consider two regions: an outer region where viscous and capillary forces dominate, and an inner region where slip is important.\n\n**Outer Region: Viscous-Capillary Balance ($b \\ll r \\ll L$)**\nIn a reference frame moving with the contact line, the solid wall moves with velocity $-U$. In the outer region, far from the microscopic details of the contact line but close enough that the interface is a slowly varying wedge, we can use the lubrication approximation for the Stokes flow.\nThe governing equations for a thin film are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} $$\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  Approximated no-slip at the wall ($y=0$): $u(x,0) = -U$. The slip term is negligible in this region because $x \\gg b$.\n2.  Shear-free interface ($y=h(x)$): $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}|_{y=h(x)} = 0$.\n\nIntegrating the momentum equation twice with respect to $y$ and applying the boundary conditions yields the velocity profile:\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{dp}{dx}y^2 - \\frac{h(x)}{\\mu}\\frac{dp}{dx}y - U $$\nThe net volume flux $Q$ must be zero in the steady state frame moving with the contact line.\n$$ Q = \\int_{0}^{h(x)} u(y) \\, dy = -\\frac{h(x)^3}{3\\mu}\\frac{dp}{dx} - U h(x) = 0 $$\nThis provides a relation for the pressure gradient:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dx} = -\\frac{3\\mu U}{h(x)^2} $$\nThe pressure jump across the curved interface is given by the Young-Laplace equation. For a small angle $\\theta(x) = h'(x)$, the curvature is $\\kappa \\approx \\frac{d^2h}{dx^2}$. The normal stress balance gives $p - p_{atm} = -\\sigma \\kappa \\approx -\\sigma \\frac{d^2h}{dx^2}$. Differentiating with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dx} = -\\sigma \\frac{d^3h}{dx^3} $$\nEquating the two expressions for the pressure gradient:\n$$ \\sigma \\frac{d^3h}{dx^3} = \\frac{3\\mu U}{h(x)^2} $$\nThis is a third-order nonlinear ODE for the interface shape $h(x)$. From a more detailed asymptotic analysis (by Cox and Hocking), this leads to a differential relation for the local angle $\\theta(x) = h'(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\theta^3)}{dx} \\approx \\frac{9 \\mu U}{\\sigma x} $$\nIntegrating this relation between two radial positions $r_1$ and $r_2$ in the outer region gives the celebrated Cox-Voinov law:\n$$ \\theta(r_2)^3 - \\theta(r_1)^3 = 9 \\frac{\\mu U}{\\sigma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right) $$\n\n**Inner Region: Slip-Dominated Flow ($r \\sim b$)**\nIn the inner region, at length scales comparable to the slip length $b$, the Navier slip condition is crucial. The full Stokes equations must be considered. The analysis of this region shows that the slip mechanism regularizes the stress singularity, and the interface slope approaches the static equilibrium angle $\\theta_e$ as the velocity $U$ approaches zero. For small $U$, the microscopic contact angle at the inner scale $b$ is effectively equal to $\\theta_e$.\n\n**Asymptotic Matching**\nWe match the outer solution with the inner solution. We apply the Cox-Voinov law between the macroscopic observation scale $r_2=L$ (where the angle is the measured dynamic angle $\\theta_d$) and the microscopic inner scale $r_1=b$ (where the angle is effectively the equilibrium angle $\\theta_e$).\n$$ \\theta_d^3 - \\theta_e^3 = 9 \\left( \\frac{\\mu U}{\\sigma} \\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{b}\\right) $$\nThis is the required leading-order analytic expression relating the contact line speed to the system parameters.\n\n**Solving for $U$**\nWe can rearrange this expression to solve for the contact-line speed $U$:\n$$ U = \\frac{\\sigma}{9\\mu} \\frac{\\theta_d^3 - \\theta_e^3}{\\ln(L/b)} $$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression.\n- $\\mu = 0.10 \\, \\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot \\mathrm{s}$\n- $\\sigma = 0.030 \\, \\mathrm{N}\\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n- $b = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{m}$\n- $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\theta_{d} = 0.35 \\, \\mathrm{rad}$\n- $\\theta_{e} = 0.20 \\, \\mathrm{rad}$\n\nFirst, we compute the components of the expression:\n- The difference of the cubes of the angles:\n$$ \\theta_d^3 - \\theta_e^3 = (0.35)^3 - (0.20)^3 = 0.042875 - 0.008 = 0.034875 $$\n- The logarithm of the length scale ratio:\n$$ \\frac{L}{b} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{m}} = 10^4 $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{b}\\right) = \\ln(10^4) = 4 \\ln(10) \\approx 4 \\times 2.302585 = 9.21034 $$\n- The prefactor:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma}{9\\mu} = \\frac{0.030}{9 \\times 0.10} = \\frac{0.030}{0.90} = \\frac{1}{30} \\approx 0.033333... $$\n\nNow, substituting these values into the expression for $U$:\n$$ U = \\left( \\frac{1}{30} \\right) \\frac{0.034875}{9.21034} \\approx 0.033333 \\times 0.0037864 \\approx 0.0001262139 \\, \\mathrm{m}\\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ U \\approx 0.0001262 \\, \\mathrm{m}\\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nIn scientific notation, this is $1.262 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m}\\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.",

Assume small contact angles throughout the evolution so that the spherical-cap approximation is valid, negligible inertia (creeping flow), and a single macroscopic lateral length scale. The hydrodynamics are described by the continuum, incompressible Navier–Stokes (NS) equations and no-slip is regularized by a finite microscopic slip length. At the contact line, use the classical matched-asymptotics dynamic contact-angle relation valid at small capillary number. The goal is to derive and implement a computational model for the evolution of the contact-line radius of the drop, and to test its predictions across multiple physically plausible parameter sets.\n\nStarting point and assumptions:\n- The fluid obeys incompressible NS and the lubrication approximation is valid in the region of small slope near the contact line, so viscous stresses balance capillary-pressure gradients. In creeping-flow conditions, inertial terms are negligible.\n- The dynamic contact angle near the contact line satisfies a matched-asymptotic relation of the Cox–Voinov type for perfect wetting at microscopic scales.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of a computational model for the spreading of a viscous liquid drop on a solid surface. The model must be based on established principles of fluid dynamics, specifically for a perfectly wetting, incompressible Newtonian liquid in the creeping flow regime, where the drop maintains a spherical-cap shape corresponding to small contact angles.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Governing Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)\n\nThe dynamics of the spreading process are governed by a balance between the capillary driving force and viscous dissipation within the liquid. We operate under the lubrication approximation, which is appropriate for the thin-film geometry characteristic of small contact angles.\n\n**1. Dynamic Contact Angle Relation:**\nThe motion of the three-phase contact line is resisted by viscous forces. A widely accepted model for the relationship between the apparent macroscopic contact angle, $\\theta$, and the contact line velocity, $U = dR/dt$, for small capillary numbers is the Cox-Voinov relation. For a perfectly wetting liquid (microscopic equilibrium contact angle of zero), this relation is:\n$$ \\theta^3 \\approx 9 \\, \\mathrm{Ca} \\, \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Ca} = \\mu U / \\sigma$ is the capillary number, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $\\sigma$ is the surface tension, $U$ is the contact line speed, $L$ is a macroscopic outer length scale, and $\\lambda$ is a microscopic slip length regularizing the no-slip condition. Substituting the definitions of $\\mathrm{Ca}$ and $U$, we obtain:\n$$ \\theta^3 \\approx \\frac{9 \\mu}{\\sigma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right) \\frac{dR}{dt} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the contact line speed in terms of the instantaneous contact angle:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{\\sigma}{9 \\mu \\ln(L/\\lambda)} \\theta^3 $$\n\n**2. Geometric Constraint (Volume Conservation):**\nThe problem assumes the drop maintains a spherical-cap geometry and that the contact angle $\\theta$ remains small. The volume $V$ of a spherical cap with contact radius $R$ and height $h$ is $V = \\frac{\\pi h}{6}(3R^2 + h^2)$. For small angles (in radians), the height is related to the radius and angle by $h \\approx \\frac{R\\theta}{2}$. Substituting this into the volume formula and retaining only the leading-order term yields:\n$$ V \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\left(\\frac{R\\theta}{2}\\right)(3R^2) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} R^3 \\theta $$\nThis geometric relation links the contact angle $\\theta$ to the contact radius $R$ for a drop of constant volume $V$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{4V}{\\pi R^3} $$\n\n**3. Formulation of the ODE:**\nTo obtain a single ODE for the contact-line radius $R(t)$, we substitute the geometric expression for $\\theta$ into the dynamic contact angle relation:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{\\sigma}{9 \\mu \\ln(L/\\lambda)} \\left( \\frac{4V}{\\pi R^3} \\right)^3 $$\nSimplifying this expression gives the governing ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\left( \\frac{64 \\sigma V^3}{9 \\pi^3 \\mu \\ln(L/\\lambda)} \\right) \\frac{1}{R^9} $$\nThis is a first-order ODE for $R(t)$. The constant prefactor is $C = \\frac{64 \\sigma V^3}{9 \\pi^3 \\mu \\ln(L/\\lambda)}$, and the power of $R$ is $-9$.\n\n### Step 2: Analytical Solution of the ODE\n\nThe derived ODE is separable and can be written as:\n$$ R^9 dR = C dt $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant prefactor identified above. We solve this by integrating both sides from an initial state $(t=0, R=R_0)$ to a later state $(t, R(t))$:\n$$ \\int_{R_0}^{R(t)} \\tilde{R}^9 \\,d\\tilde{R} = \\int_{0}^{t} C \\,d\\tau $$\n$$ \\left[ \\frac{\\tilde{R}^{10}}{10} \\right]_{R_0}^{R(t)} = C t $$\n$$ \\frac{R(t)^{10}}{10} - \\frac{R_0^{10}}{10} = C t $$\nSolving for $R(t)$ yields:\n$$ R(t)^{10} = R_0^{10} + 10 C t $$\n$$ R(t) = \\left( R_0^{10} + 10 C t \\right)^{1/10} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $C$, we arrive at the explicit solution for the contact-line radius as a function of time:\n$$ R(t) = \\left( R_0^{10} + \\frac{640 \\sigma V^3 t}{9 \\pi^3 \\mu \\ln(L/\\lambda)} \\right)^{1/10} $$\nThis expression is a form of Tanner's Law, which predicts that for long times ($t \\to \\infty$), the radius grows as $R(t) \\propto t^{1/10}$.\n\nThe initial radius $R_0$ is determined by the initial conditions. Using the small-angle volume relation at $t=0$ with the initial angle $\\theta_0$:\n$$ V = \\frac{\\pi}{4} R_0^3 \\theta_0 $$\nSolving for $R_0$ gives:\n$$ R_0 = \\left( \\frac{4V}{\\pi \\theta_0} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n### Step 3: Computational Implementation\n\nThe program will implement the analytical solution derived above. For each test case, it will first compute the initial radius $R_0$ using the provided volume $V$ and initial angle $\\theta_0$. Then, it will use the full expression for $R(t)$ to calculate the final radius $R(t_{\\mathrm{end}})$ at the specified time $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$ using the given material and geometric parameters.

Let the phase-field order parameter be $\\phi \\in [-1,1]$, with $\\phi=+1$ denoting the liquid and $\\phi=-1$ denoting the gas. The Helmholtz free-energy functional is given by\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}[\\phi] = \\int_{\\Omega} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa}{2} |\\nabla \\phi|^2 + \\Psi(\\phi) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}V + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega_w} \\gamma_w(\\phi) \\, \\mathrm{d}S,\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa>0$ is a constant with units of $\\mathrm{J/m}$, $\\Psi(\\phi)$ is the bulk free-energy density with units of $\\mathrm{J/m^3}$, and $\\gamma_w(\\phi)$ is the wall free-energy density with units of $\\mathrm{N/m}$ defined on the solid boundary $\\partial\\Omega_w$.

The apparent contact angle at the moving contact line is defined as the macroscopic angle $\\theta_{\\mathrm{app}}$ far from the microscopic interfacial region. The fluid obeys incompressible Stokes flow near the contact line. The Capillary number is defined as $\\mathrm{Ca} = \\mu U / \\sigma$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity (units $\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$), $U$ is a characteristic contact-line speed (units $\\mathrm{m/s}$), and $\\sigma$ is the liquid-gas surface tension (units $\\mathrm{N/m}$).

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of a computational procedure to determine the static equilibrium contact angle $\\theta_e$ and the apparent dynamic contact angle $\\theta_{\\mathrm{app}}$ for a two-phase fluid system at a solid wall. The system is described by a phase-field model based on a Ginzburg-Landau-type free-energy functional. The solution involves three sequential steps: computing the liquid-gas surface tension $\\sigma$, then the static contact angle $\\theta_e$, and finally the dynamic contact angle $\\theta_{\\mathrm{app}}$.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Liquid-Gas Surface Tension $\\sigma$\n\nThe liquid-gas surface tension, $\\sigma$, is the excess free energy per unit area associated with creating a flat interface between the two phases. For a one-dimensional, stationary, planar interface varying along a coordinate $z$, the free-energy functional per unit area reduces to:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dz}\\right)^2 + \\Psi(\\phi) \\right) dz\n$$\nThe equilibrium profile $\\phi(z)$ that minimizes this energy is governed by the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$\n\\kappa \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dz^2} = \\frac{d\\Psi}{d\\phi} = \\frac{d}{d\\phi}\\left(\\frac{A}{4} (\\phi^2 - 1)^2\\right) = A\\phi(\\phi^2-1)\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\frac{d\\phi}{dz}$ and integrating with respect to $z$ yields the first integral of motion:\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dz}\\right)^2 = \\Psi(\\phi) + C\n$$\nApplying the boundary conditions $\\phi \\to \\pm 1$ and $\\frac{d\\phi}{dz} \\to 0$ as $z \\to \\pm\\infty$, and noting that $\\Psi(\\pm 1) = 0$, we find the integration constant $C=0$. Thus, for the equilibrium profile, the kinetic and potential energy contributions are equipartitioned: $\\frac{\\kappa}{2} (\\frac{d\\phi}{dz})^2 = \\Psi(\\phi)$.\n\nWe can now substitute this back into the integral for $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\left( \\Psi(\\phi) + \\Psi(\\phi) \\right) dz = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} 2\\Psi(\\phi) dz\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we change the integration variable from $z$ to $\\phi$. From the equipartition relation, we have $\\frac{d\\phi}{dz} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\Psi(\\phi)}{\\kappa}}$, which implies $dz = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa}{2\\Psi(\\phi)}} d\\phi$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\int_{-1}^{+1} 2\\Psi(\\phi) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa}{2\\Psi(\\phi)}} d\\phi = \\int_{-1}^{+1} \\sqrt{2\\kappa\\Psi(\\phi)} d\\phi\n$$\nSubstituting $\\Psi(\\phi) = \\frac{A}{4}(1-\\phi^2)^2$:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\int_{-1}^{+1} \\sqrt{2\\kappa \\frac{A}{4}(1-\\phi^2)^2} d\\phi = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa A}{2}} \\int_{-1}^{+1} (1-\\phi^2) d\\phi\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{+1} (1-\\phi^2) d\\phi = \\left[\\phi - \\frac{\\phi^3}{3}\\right]_{-1}^{+1} = \\left(1-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\left(-1+\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\nThus, the surface tension is:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa A}{2}} \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\sqrt{\\kappa A}\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Equilibrium Contact Angle $\\theta_e$\n\nThe equilibrium contact angle $\\theta_e$ is determined by the balance of forces at the three-phase contact line, a result encapsulated by Young's equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_{sg} = \\sigma_{sl} + \\sigma \\cos\\theta_e\n$$\nHere, $\\sigma_{sg}$ and $\\sigma_{sl}$ are the solid-gas and solid-liquid interfacial energy densities, respectively. In the phase-field model, these correspond to the wall free-energy density $\\gamma_w(\\phi) = -h\\phi$ evaluated at the bulk phase values $\\phi=-1$ (gas) and $\\phi=+1$ (liquid).\n$$\n\\sigma_{sg} = \\gamma_w(\\phi=-1) = -h(-1) = h\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{sl} = \\gamma_w(\\phi=+1) = -h(1) = -h\n$$\nSubstituting these into Young's equation:\n$$\nh = -h + \\sigma \\cos\\theta_e \\implies 2h = \\sigma \\cos\\theta_e\n$$\nSolving for $\\cos\\theta_e$ and using the expression for $\\sigma$ derived in Step 1:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta_e = \\frac{2h}{\\sigma} = \\frac{2h}{\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\sqrt{\\kappa A}} = \\frac{3h}{\\sqrt{2\\kappa A}}\n$$\nAs required by the problem statement, for the result to be physically admissible, $|\\cos\\theta_e| \\le 1$. If the calculated value exceeds this range, it must be saturated (clipped) to $\\pm 1$. This corresponds to complete wetting ($\\theta_e=0$) or complete drying ($\\theta_e=\\pi$).\n$$\n\\theta_e = \\arccos\\left(\\text{clip}\\left(\\frac{3h}{\\sqrt{2\\kappa A}}, -1, 1\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Apparent Dynamic Contact Angle $\\theta_{\\mathrm{app}}$\n\nFor a moving contact line at low Capillary number $\\mathrm{Ca} = \\mu U / \\sigma$, the apparent contact angle $\\theta_{\\mathrm{app}}$ deviates from the static angle $\\theta_e$. This deviation is due to the viscous stresses that must be overcome for the contact line to move. The relationship between angle and speed can be found by a matched asymptotic analysis, balancing viscous dissipation in a macroscopic fluid wedge (\"outer region\") with the capillary forces resolved at a microscopic scale (\"inner region\").\n\nThe diffuse interface of the phase-field model provides a natural regularization for the stress singularity at the contact line. The characteristic thickness of this interface serves as the microscopic cutoff length, $l_c$. The equilibrium profile $\\phi(z)=\\tanh(z/\\xi)$ for a planar interface allows us to identify this thickness $\\xi$. Substituting this profile into the Euler-Lagrange equation $\\kappa \\phi'' = A\\phi(\\phi^2-1)$ yields $\\xi = \\sqrt{2\\kappa/A}$. So, we set $l_c = \\xi = \\sqrt{2\\kappa/A}$.\n\nThe result of the asymptotic matching (known as the Cox-Voinov law) relates the contact angle to the capillary number and the ratio of the macroscopic length scale $L$ to the microscopic cutoff $l_c$. For a system where one fluid is much more viscous than the other (liquid vs. gas), a common form of this law, particularly for small angles but often used as an approximation for a wider range, is cubic in the angles:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{app}}^3 - \\theta_e^3 = 9 \\, \\mathrm{Ca} \\, \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{l_c}\\right)\n$$\nThis constitutes the model for the dynamic contact angle correction specified by the problem. Rearranging for $\\theta_{\\mathrm{app}}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\left( \\theta_e^3 + 9 \\frac{\\mu U}{\\sigma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2\\kappa/A}}\\right) \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThe problem requires that if the argument of the cubic root is negative, it should be saturated to $0$ to ensure a real-valued, physical result. This situation arises if $L < l_c$ or for a receding contact line ($U<0$), although $U$ is positive in the test cases. When $L=l_c$, the logarithmic term vanishes, and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{app}}=\\theta_e$, which is physically consistent as the scale separation supporting the asymptotic theory disappears.\n\n### Summary of the Computational Procedure\n\nFor each set of parameters $(\\kappa, A, h, \\mu, U, L)$:\n1.  Calculate surface tension: $\\sigma = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\sqrt{\\kappa A}$.\n2.  Calculate the raw value for $\\cos\\theta_e$: $\\cos\\theta_{e, \\text{raw}} = \\frac{3h}{\\sqrt{2\\kappa A}}$.\n3.  Clip the value to the physical range $[-1, 1]$: $\\cos\\theta_e = \\text{clip}(\\cos\\theta_{e, \\text{raw}}, -1, 1)$.\n4.  Compute the static angle: $\\theta_e = \\arccos(\\cos\\theta_e)$.\n5.  Calculate the microscopic cutoff length: $\\xi = \\sqrt{2\\kappa/A}$.\n6.  If $L$ is not given as a number, calculate it as $L=\\xi$ for the special case.\n7.  Calculate the Capillary number: $\\mathrm{Ca} = \\mu U / \\sigma$.\n8.  Compute the argument for the cubic root, ensuring $L/\\xi \\ge 1$: $\\text{arg} = \\theta_e^3 + 9 \\cdot \\mathrm{Ca} \\cdot \\ln(L/\\xi)$.\n9.  Saturate the argument at zero as per problem constraints: $\\text{arg}_{\\text{sat}} = \\max(0, \\text{arg})$.\n10. Compute the dynamic angle: $\\theta_{\\mathrm{app}} = (\\text{arg}_{\\text{sat}})^{1/3}$.\n11. Return $[\\theta_e, \\theta_{\\mathrm{app}}]$.",
