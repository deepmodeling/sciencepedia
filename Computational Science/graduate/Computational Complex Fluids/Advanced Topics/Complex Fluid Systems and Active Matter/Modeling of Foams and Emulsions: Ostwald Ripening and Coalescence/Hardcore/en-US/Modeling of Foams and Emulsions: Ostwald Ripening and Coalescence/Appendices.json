            "problem": "Consider a spherical oil droplet of radius $R$ dispersed in a dilute aqueous emulsion at temperature $T$. The interfacial tension between oil and water is $\\gamma$, and the pressure jump across the curved interface is given by Laplace’s law $\\Delta p = 2\\gamma/R$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of thermodynamics and colloid science, specifically concerning the phenomenon of Ostwald ripening. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary physical laws, definitions, and constants to derive the Kelvin relation and subsequently compute the requested radius. All provided values are physically realistic and dimensionally consistent. The problem is objective and free of ambiguity.\n\nThe derivation of the Kelvin relation begins with the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium between the oil in the droplet and the oil dissolved in the continuous aqueous phase. At equilibrium, the chemical potential of the oil molecules must be equal in both phases.\n\nLet $\\mu_{oil}(R)$ be the chemical potential of the oil within a spherical droplet of radius $R$, and let $\\mu_{aq}(c)$ be the chemical potential of the dissolved oil in the aqueous phase at a concentration $c$. The equilibrium condition is:\n$$\n\\mu_{oil}(R) = \\mu_{aq}(c(R))\n$$\nwhere $c(R)$ is the equilibrium solubility of oil from a droplet of radius $R$.\n\nThe chemical potential of the oil inside the droplet is a function of the internal pressure, $p_{in}$. The pressure inside the droplet is higher than the pressure in the surrounding aqueous phase, $p_{out}$, due to the interfacial tension $\\gamma$. This pressure difference is given by the Young-Laplace equation for a spherical interface:\n$$\n\\Delta p = p_{in} - p_{out} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\n$$\nThe dependence of chemical potential on pressure at constant temperature $T$ is given by the fundamental thermodynamic relation:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial p} \\right)_T = v_m\n$$\nwhere $v_m$ is the molar volume of the substance. Since the problem states that the oil is incompressible, $v_m$ is constant. We can integrate this relation from a reference pressure $p_{out}$ (the pressure corresponding to a planar interface) to the pressure $p_{in}$ inside the droplet:\n$$\n\\mu_{oil}(p_{in}) - \\mu_{oil}(p_{out}) = \\int_{p_{out}}^{p_{in}} v_m \\, dp = v_m (p_{in} - p_{out})\n$$\nSubstituting the Young-Laplace pressure, we get:\n$$\n\\mu_{oil}(R) = \\mu_{oil}(p_{out}) + \\frac{2\\gamma v_m}{R}\n$$\nHere, $\\mu_{oil}(p_{out})$ represents the chemical potential of the oil in a bulk phase in equilibrium with a planar interface (i.e., as $R \\to \\infty$).\n\nFor the aqueous phase, treated as an ideal dilute solution, the chemical potential of the dissolved oil is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_{aq}(c) = \\mu^{\\circ} + R_g T \\ln c\n$$\nwhere $\\mu^{\\circ}$ is the standard state chemical potential, $R_g$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nAt equilibrium for a droplet of radius $R$, we have:\n$$\n\\mu_{oil}(p_{out}) + \\frac{2\\gamma v_m}{R} = \\mu^{\\circ} + R_g T \\ln(c(R))\n$$\nNow, consider the case of a planar interface ($R \\to \\infty$). The pressure term vanishes ($\\frac{2\\gamma v_m}{R} \\to 0$), and the equilibrium solubility is denoted as $c(\\infty)$. The equilibrium condition becomes:\n$$\n\\mu_{oil}(p_{out}) = \\mu_{aq}(c(\\infty)) = \\mu^{\\circ} + R_g T \\ln(c(\\infty))\n$$\nThis equation defines the relationship between the standard state potential $\\mu^{\\circ}$ and the reference chemical potential of the bulk oil phase $\\mu_{oil}(p_{out})$ via the planar solubility $c(\\infty)$.\n\nBy substituting the expression for $\\mu_{oil}(p_{out})$ from the planar case into the equation for the curved interface, we get:\n$$\n(\\mu^{\\circ} + R_g T \\ln(c(\\infty))) + \\frac{2\\gamma v_m}{R} = \\mu^{\\circ} + R_g T \\ln(c(R))\n$$\nThe standard potential $\\mu^{\\circ}$ cancels out. Rearranging the terms gives:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\gamma v_m}{R} = R_g T \\ln(c(R)) - R_g T \\ln(c(\\infty)) = R_g T \\ln\\left(\\frac{c(R)}{c(\\infty)}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for the ratio of solubilities yields the Kelvin relation:\n$$\n\\frac{c(R)}{c(\\infty)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\gamma v_m}{R_g T R}\\right)\n$$\nor\n$$\nc(R) = c(\\infty) \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\gamma v_m}{R_g T R}\\right)\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nTo check the planar interface limit, we take the limit as $R \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{R \\to \\infty} c(R) = c(\\infty) \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\gamma v_m}{R_g T R}\\right)\n$$\nAs $R \\to \\infty$, the argument of the exponential approaches zero: $\\frac{2\\gamma v_m}{R_g T R} \\to 0$. Since $\\exp(0) = 1$, the limit becomes:\n$$\n\\lim_{R \\to \\infty} c(R) = c(\\infty) \\cdot 1 = c(\\infty)\n$$\nThe relation correctly reduces to the planar interface solubility, as required.\n\nThe problem defines the dimensionless curvature correction as $\\epsilon(R) \\equiv \\frac{2\\gamma v_m}{R_g T R}$. We are asked to find the radius $R^{\\ast}$ for which this correction is $\\epsilon(R^{\\ast}) = 0.01$.\n$$\n\\frac{2\\gamma v_m}{R_g T R^{\\ast}} = 0.01\n$$\nSolving for $R^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nR^{\\ast} = \\frac{2\\gamma v_m}{0.01 \\cdot R_g T}\n$$\nFirst, we must calculate the molar volume $v_m$ from the given molecular volume $\\Omega$ and Avogadro's constant $N_A$:\n$$\nv_m = \\Omega N_A\n$$\nThe given values are:\n$\\gamma = 30\\,\\text{mN/m} = 30 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{J/m}^2$\n$\\Omega = 1.5 \\times 10^{-28}\\,\\text{m}^{3}$\n$N_A = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$\n$R_g = 8.314462618\\,\\text{J\\,mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n$T = 298\\,\\text{K}$\n\nCalculating the molar volume $v_m$:\n$$\nv_m = (1.5 \\times 10^{-28}\\,\\text{m}^{3}) \\times (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}) \\approx 9.033211 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we substitute all values into the expression for $R^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nR^{\\ast} = \\frac{2 \\times (30 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{J/m}^2) \\times (9.033211 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{mol}^{-1})}{0.01 \\times (8.314462618\\,\\text{J\\,mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (298\\,\\text{K})}\n$$\nLet's compute the numerator and denominator separately.\nNumerator:\n$$\n2 \\times (30 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (9.033211 \\times 10^{-5}) = 5.4199266 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{J}\\cdot\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{mol}^{-1}\n$$\nDenominator:\n$$\n0.01 \\times (8.314462618) \\times (298) = 24.7771086\\,\\text{J}\\cdot\\text{mol}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, the division:\n$$\nR^{\\ast} = \\frac{5.4199266 \\times 10^{-6}}{24.7771086}\\,\\text{m} \\approx 2.18749 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}\n$$\nThe question requests the answer in nanometers ($1\\,\\text{nm} = 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}$).\n$$\nR^{\\ast} \\approx (2.18749 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1\\,\\text{nm}}{10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}}\\right) = 218.749\\,\\text{nm}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $219\\,\\text{nm}$.",
