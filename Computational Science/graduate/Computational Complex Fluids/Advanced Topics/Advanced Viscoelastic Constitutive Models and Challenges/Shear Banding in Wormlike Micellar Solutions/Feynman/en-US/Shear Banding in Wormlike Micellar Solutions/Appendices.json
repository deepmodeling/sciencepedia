A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the maximum growth rate, $\\lambda_{\\max}$, of small perturbations about a homogeneous steady state.\n\nFirst, we define the homogeneous steady base state, denoted by $(\\sigma_{0}, \\dot{\\gamma}_{0})$. This state is a solution to the governing equations with time and space derivatives set to zero. The constitutive equation becomes:\n$$\n0 = f(\\sigma_{0}, \\dot{\\gamma}_{0}) = -\\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{\\tau} + \\frac{G\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}}{1 + b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2}}\n$$\nThis gives the steady-state micellar stress as a function of the steady shear rate:\n$$\n\\sigma_{0} = \\frac{G \\tau \\dot{\\gamma}_{0}}{1 + b \\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2}}\n$$\nNext, we introduce small perturbations to this base state:\n$$\n\\sigma(y,t) = \\sigma_{0} + \\delta\\sigma(y,t)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}(y,t) = \\dot{\\gamma}_{0} + \\delta\\dot{\\gamma}(y,t)\n$$\nWe linearize the governing equations with respect to these perturbations.\n\nThe constitutive equation is $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial t} = f(\\sigma,\\dot{\\gamma}) + D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\sigma}{\\partial y^{2}}$.\nSubstituting the perturbed fields, and keeping only terms of first order in the perturbations:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\sigma_{0} + \\delta\\sigma) = f(\\sigma_{0} + \\delta\\sigma, \\dot{\\gamma}_{0} + \\delta\\dot{\\gamma}) + D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial y^{2}}(\\sigma_{0} + \\delta\\sigma)\n$$\nSince $\\sigma_{0}$ is constant in time and space, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\delta\\sigma}{\\partial t} = f(\\sigma_{0} + \\delta\\sigma, \\dot{\\gamma}_{0} + \\delta\\dot{\\gamma}) + D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\delta\\sigma}{\\partial y^{2}}\n$$\nWe perform a first-order Taylor expansion of $f(\\sigma, \\dot{\\gamma})$ around the base state $(\\sigma_{0}, \\dot{\\gamma}_{0})$:\n$$\nf(\\sigma_{0} + \\delta\\sigma, \\dot{\\gamma}_{0} + \\delta\\dot{\\gamma}) \\approx f(\\sigma_{0}, \\dot{\\gamma}_{0}) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma}\\bigg|_{0}\\delta\\sigma + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\dot{\\gamma}}\\bigg|_{0}\\delta\\dot{\\gamma}\n$$\nBy definition of the base state, $f(\\sigma_{0}, \\dot{\\gamma}_{0}) = 0$.

Thus, any perturbation to the total stress must vanish: $\\delta T_{xy} = 0$.\n$$\n\\delta T_{xy} = \\delta\\sigma + \\eta_{s}\\delta\\dot{\\gamma} = 0\n$$\nThis provides a crucial relation between the stress and shear rate perturbations:\n$$\n\\delta\\dot{\\gamma} = -\\frac{1}{\\eta_{s}}\\delta\\sigma\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\delta\\dot{\\gamma}$ into the linearized constitutive equation eliminates $\\delta\\dot{\\gamma}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\delta\\sigma}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\delta\\sigma + \\left[ \\frac{G(1 - b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2})}{(1 + b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2})^{2}} \\right]\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\eta_{s}}\\delta\\sigma\\right) + D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\delta\\sigma}{\\partial y^{2}}\n$$\nCombining the terms proportional to $\\delta\\sigma$, we obtain a single linear partial differential equation for the micellar stress perturbation $\\delta\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\delta\\sigma}{\\partial t} = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\tau} - \\frac{G(1 - b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2})}{\\eta_{s}(1 + b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2})^{2}} \\right]\\delta\\sigma + D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\delta\\sigma}{\\partial y^{2}}\n$$\nNow we analyze the stability of this equation by considering normal mode perturbations of the form $\\delta\\sigma(y,t) \\propto \\exp(\\lambda t + i k y)$. Substituting this into the PDE:\n-   $\\frac{\\partial \\delta\\sigma}{\\partial t} = \\lambda \\delta\\sigma$\n-   $\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\delta\\sigma}{\\partial y^{2}} = (ik)^{2}\\delta\\sigma = -k^{2}\\delta\\sigma$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\n\\lambda \\delta\\sigma = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\tau} - \\frac{G(1 - b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2})}{\\eta_{s}(1 + b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2})^{2}} \\right]\\delta\\sigma + D(-k^{2})\\delta\\sigma\n$$\nDividing by the non-trivial amplitude of $\\delta\\sigma$, we obtain the dispersion relation for the growth rate $\\lambda$ as a function of the wavenumber $k$:\n$$\n\\lambda(k) = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} - \\frac{G(1 - b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2})}{\\eta_{s}(1 + b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2})^{2}} - Dk^{2}\n$$\nThe final step is to find the maximum growth rate, $\\lambda_{\\max}$, by maximizing $\\lambda(k)$ over all real wavenumbers $k$. The expression for $\\lambda(k)$ is a parabolic function of $k$, opening downwards with respect to $k^2$ because the diffusion coefficient $D  0$. The maximum value must therefore occur at the minimum possible value of $k^{2}$. Since $k$ is a real number, the minimum value of $k^{2}$ is $0$, which occurs at $k=0$. This corresponds to the long-wavelength limit.\nSetting $k=0$ in the dispersion relation gives the maximum growth rate:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max} = \\lambda(k=0) = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} - \\frac{G(1 - b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2})}{\\eta_{s}(1 + b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2})^{2}}\n$$\nThis expression represents the growth rate of a homogeneous perturbation. The instability ($\\lambda_{\\max}  0$) occurs when the term in the square brackets of the linearized PDE is positive, which corresponds to a negative slope in the steady-state total stress versus shear rate curve, the classical criterion for this type of flow instability.\n\nThe expression can be written as:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max} = -\\left( \\frac{1}{\\tau} + \\frac{G(1 - b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2})}{\\eta_{s}(1 + b\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}^{2})^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nThe units of this expression are inverse time ($s^{-1}$), as required. For instance, the first term $1/\\tau$ has units of $s^{-1}$. For the second term, $[G] = \\text{Pa}$, $[\\eta_s] = \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}$, $[\\dot{\\gamma}_0] = \\text{s}^{-1}$, and $[b] = \\text{s}^2$.

The term $f(\\phi)$ is a local potential energy density. The problem states it is a symmetric double-well potential with two equivalent minima at $\\phi = -1$ and $\\phi = +1$. These two values of the order parameter, $\\phi$, represent the two distinct, stable, and homogeneous states of the system (in this case, the low and high shear rate bands). The integral $\\int f(\\phi) dy$ represents the total \"bulk\" energy of the system. In regions where $\\phi$ is close to $\\pm 1$, the contribution to the integral is minimal, reflecting the stability of these states.\n\n$2$. The term $\\frac{D\\,\\tau}{2}\\left(\\frac{d \\phi}{d y}\\right)^{2}$ is a gradient penalty term. It represents the energy cost associated with spatial variations in the order parameter $\\phi$. An interface between the two bands is a region where $\\phi(y)$ changes from $-1$ to $+1$, so its gradient $\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}$ is non-zero. This term penalizes such gradients, meaning it requires energy to form an interface. The quadratic form is the simplest and leading-order isotropic term that penalizes gradients. The coefficient $\\frac{D\\tau}{2}$ sets the magnitude of this energy cost and is related to the physical process of stress diffusion ($D$) over a characteristic time scale ($\\tau$), which acts to smooth out sharp structural gradients.\n\nThe steady-state profile $\\phi(y)$ is the one that minimizes the total effective energy $\\mathcal{F}[\\phi]$. To find this profile, we use the calculus of variations. The condition for $\\mathcal{F}[\\phi]$ to be an extremum is that its first variation vanishes, which leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation. The integrand, let us call it the Lagrangian density, is $L\\left(\\phi, \\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right) = f(\\phi) + \\frac{D\\tau}{2}\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2$. The one-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi} - \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial (d\\phi/dy)}\\right) \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi} \\;=\\; \\frac{df}{d\\phi}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial (d\\phi/dy)} \\;=\\; D\\tau \\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{d\\phi} - \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(D\\tau \\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right) \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nAssuming $D$ and $\\tau$ are constants, this simplifies to the general condition for the steady profile:\n$$\nD\\tau \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dy^2} \\;=\\; \\frac{df}{d\\phi}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Solution for the Specific Potential\n\nWe are given the specific double-well potential $f(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\phi^2 - 1)^2$. Its derivative with respect to $\\phi$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{d\\phi} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2(\\phi^2 - 1) \\cdot (2\\phi) \\;=\\; \\phi(\\phi^2 - 1) \\;=\\; \\phi^3 - \\phi\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Euler-Lagrange equation derived in Part 1, we obtain the second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $\\phi(y)$:\n$$\nD\\tau \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dy^2} \\;=\\; \\phi^3 - \\phi\n$$\nTo solve this ODE, we can find a first integral. We multiply both sides by $\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}$:\n$$\nD\\tau \\frac{d\\phi}{dy} \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dy^2} \\;=\\; (\\phi^3 - \\phi) \\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten using the chain rule as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dy}\\left[\\frac{D\\tau}{2}\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2\\right] \\;=\\; \\frac{d}{dy}\\left[\\frac{1}{4}\\phi^4 - \\frac{1}{2}\\phi^2\\right]\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $y$ yields the first integral of the motion:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\tau}{2}\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2 \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}\\phi^4 - \\frac{1}{2}\\phi^2 + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is an integration constant. We determine $C$ from the boundary conditions at $y \\to \\pm \\infty$: we are given $\\phi(\\pm\\infty) = \\pm 1$ and $\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}(\\pm\\infty) = 0$. Applying the condition at $y \\to +\\infty$ (where $\\phi = 1$ and $\\frac{d\\phi}{dy} = 0$):\n$$\n\\frac{D\\tau}{2}(0)^2 \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}(1)^4 - \\frac{1}{2}(1)^2 + C \\quad\\implies\\quad 0 \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} + C \\quad\\implies\\quad C \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nSubstituting $C=\\frac{1}{4}$ back into the first integral:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\tau}{2}\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2 \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}\\phi^4 - \\frac{1}{2}\\phi^2 + \\frac{1}{4} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}(\\phi^4 - 2\\phi^2 + 1) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}(\\phi^2 - 1)^2\n$$\nNow we solve for $\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}\\right)^2 \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2D\\tau}(\\phi^2 - 1)^2\n$$\nTaking the square root gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dy} \\;=\\; \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2D\\tau}}(\\phi^2 - 1)\n$$\nSince the profile goes from $\\phi = -1$ at $y \\to -\\infty$ to $\\phi = +1$ at $y \\to +\\infty$, the slope $\\frac{d\\phi}{dy}$ must be positive. For the domain of interest, $-1  \\phi  1$, the term $\\phi^2-1$ is negative. To ensure a positive slope, we select the negative sign: $\\frac{d\\phi}{dy} = - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2D\\tau}}(\\phi^2 - 1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2D\\tau}}(1 - \\phi^2)$.\nThis is a separable first-order ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{1 - \\phi^2} \\;=\\; \\frac{dy}{\\sqrt{2D\\tau}}\n$$\nWe integrate both sides. Let's assume the interface is centered at $y=y_0$, where $\\phi(y_0)=0$. We integrate from $y'$ to $y$ and $\\phi'$ to $\\phi$: $\\int_{0}^{\\phi} \\frac{d\\phi'}{1 - (\\phi')^2} = \\int_{y_0}^{y} \\frac{dy'}{\\sqrt{2D\\tau}}$.\nThe integral on the left is the definition of the inverse hyperbolic tangent function, $\\arctanh(\\phi)$:\n$$\n\\left[ \\arctanh(\\phi') \\right]_{0}^{\\phi} \\;=\\; \\left[ \\frac{y'}{\\sqrt{2D\\tau}} \\right]_{y_0}^{y}\n$$\n$$\n\\arctanh(\\phi) - \\arctanh(0) \\;=\\; \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{2D\\tau}} - \\frac{y_0}{\\sqrt{2D\\tau}}\n$$\nSince $\\arctanh(0)=0$, we have:\n$$\n\\arctanh(\\phi) \\;=\\; \\frac{y-y_0}{\\sqrt{2D\\tau}}\n$$\nSolving for $\\phi(y)$ gives the explicit steady interface profile:\n$$\n\\phi(y) \\;=\\; \\tanh\\left(\\frac{y-y_0}{\\sqrt{2D\\tau}}\\right)\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Determination of the Characteristic Width\n\nThe problem asks to identify the characteristic interfacial width parameter $a$ by comparing our derived solution to the standard kink form:\n$$\n\\phi(y) \\;=\\; \\tanh\\left(\\frac{y-y_0}{a}\\right)\n$$\nBy direct comparison of our solution from Part 2 with this template, we can equate the denominators in the argument of the hyperbolic tangent function:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{a} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2D\\tau}}\n$$\nTherefore, the characteristic interfacial width $a$ is given by:\n$$\na \\;=\\; \\sqrt{2D\\tau}\n$$\nThis parameter represents the characteristic length scale over which the order parameter transitions from one stable state to the other, and is determined by the interplay between the stress diffusivity $D$ and the relaxation time $\\tau$.",
