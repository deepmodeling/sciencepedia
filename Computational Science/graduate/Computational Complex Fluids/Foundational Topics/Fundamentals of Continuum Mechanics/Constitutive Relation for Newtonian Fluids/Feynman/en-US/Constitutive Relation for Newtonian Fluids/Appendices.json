A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the equation for conservation of linear momentum for a steady flow in the absence of body forces, which is a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations. In terms of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThe Cauchy stress tensor for an incompressible Newtonian fluid is given by $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, where $p$ is the pressure, $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor, and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the deviatoric (viscous) stress tensor. The constitutive relation for $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = 2\\mu\\mathbf{D}$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\mathbf{v} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{v})^T)$ is the rate-of-deformation tensor.\n\nThe problem states the flow is fully developed and axisymmetric with a velocity field $\\mathbf{v} = v_z(r)\\mathbf{e}_z$. This implies $v_r = 0$, $v_\\theta = 0$, and all derivatives with respect to $\\theta$ are zero. Additionally, \"fully developed\" means the velocity profile does not change in the direction of flow, so $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the components of the rate-of-deformation tensor $\\mathbf{D}$ in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$:\n- $D_{rr} = \\frac{\\partial v_r}{\\partial r} = 0$\n- $D_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial v_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{v_r}{r} = 0$\n- $D_{zz} = \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$\n- $D_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(r\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(\\frac{v_\\theta}{r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial v_r}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) = 0$\n- $D_{\\theta z} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial v_\\theta}{\\partial z} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) = 0$\n- $D_{rz} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial v_r}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d v_z}{d r}$\n\nThe only non-zero components of the viscous stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = 2\\mu\\mathbf{D}$ are therefore:\n$$ \\tau_{rz} = \\tau_{zr} = 2\\mu D_{rz} = \\mu \\frac{d v_z}{d r} $$\nThe components of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ are:\n$\\sigma_{rr} = -p$, $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = -p$, $\\sigma_{zz} = -p$, and $\\sigma_{rz} = \\tau_{rz} = \\mu \\frac{d v_z}{d r}$. All other off-diagonal components are zero.\n\nNow, we write the components of the momentum equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$ in cylindrical coordinates:\n- $r$-component: $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{rr}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{r\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{rz}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\sigma_{rr}-\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{r} = 0 \\implies -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} + 0 + 0 + \\frac{-p - (-p)}{r} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = 0$.\n- $\\theta$-component: $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{r\\theta}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\theta z}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{2\\sigma_{r\\theta}}{r} = 0 \\implies -\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\theta} + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$.\nThese results show that pressure $p$ is a function of $z$ only, i.e., $p = p(z)$.\n\n- $z$-component: $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial(r\\sigma_{rz})}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\theta z}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} = 0$.\nSubstituting the stress components:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{d r}(r\\tau_{rz}) + \\frac{d(-p)}{dz} = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{d r}(r\\tau_{rz}) = \\frac{dp}{dz} $$\nSince the left side depends only on $r$ and the right side depends only on $z$, both must be equal to a constant. The pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dz}$ is constant. Integrating with respect to $z$ from the inlet ($z=0$) to the outlet ($z=L$):\n$$ \\int_{p_{\\mathrm{in}}}^{p_{\\mathrm{out}}} dp = \\int_0^L \\frac{dp}{dz} dz \\implies p_{\\mathrm{out}} - p_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{dp}{dz} L $$\nThe constant pressure gradient is $\\frac{dp}{dz} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{out}} - p_{\\mathrm{in}}}{L} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}$, where $\\Delta p = p_{\\mathrm{in}} - p_{\\mathrm{out}}$.\n\n**1. Shear Stress Distribution $\\tau_{rz}(r)$**\nWe can now solve for the shear stress by integrating the $z$-momentum equation:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}(r\\tau_{rz}) = r \\frac{dp}{dz} = -r \\frac{\\Delta p}{L} $$\nIntegrating with respect to $r$:\n$$ r\\tau_{rz}(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2L}r^2 + C_1 $$\n$$ \\tau_{rz}(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2L}r + \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\nFor the shear stress to be finite at the centerline of the pipe ($r=0$), the constant of integration $C_1$ must be zero. Therefore, the shear stress distribution is:\n$$ \\tau_{rz}(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2L}r $$\nThis shows a linear variation of shear stress with radius, being zero at the center and having maximum magnitude at the pipe wall.\n\n**2. Axial Velocity Profile $v_z(r)$**\nWe equate the derived shear stress with the constitutive relation:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{d v_z}{d r} = \\tau_{rz}(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2L}r $$\nRearranging gives a differential equation for the velocity $v_z$:\n$$ \\frac{d v_z}{d r} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L}r $$\nIntegrating with respect to $r$:\n$$ v_z(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L}r^2 + C_2 $$\nThe constant of integration $C_2$ is determined from the no-slip boundary condition at the pipe wall, $v_z(R) = 0$:\n$$ v_z(R) = 0 = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L}R^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L}R^2 $$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back into the velocity equation gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ v_z(r) = \\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L}R^2 - \\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L}r^2 = \\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L}(R^2 - r^2) $$\n\n**3. Volumetric Flow Rate $Q$**\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is obtained by integrating the velocity profile over the pipe's cross-sectional area $A$. The differential area element is $dA = 2\\pi r dr$.\n$$ Q = \\int_A v_z(r) dA = \\int_0^R v_z(r) (2\\pi r) dr $$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_z(r)$:\n$$ Q = \\int_0^R \\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L}(R^2 - r^2) (2\\pi r) dr $$\nFactoring out the constants:\n$$ Q = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta p}{4\\mu L} \\int_0^R (R^2 r - r^3) dr = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\int_0^R (R^2 r - r^3) dr $$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left[ \\frac{R^2 r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_0^R $$\nEvaluating at the limits of integration:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\left(\\frac{R^2 R^2}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4}\\right) - (0) \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) $$\nThis yields the final expression for the volumetric flow rate, known as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta p}{8\\mu L} $$\nThis expression gives the flow rate $Q$ as a function of the pressure drop $\\Delta p$, pipe radius $R$, fluid viscosity $\\mu$, and pipe length $L$, as required.",

A solution will be derived based on first principles.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nWe will analyze the state of stress for the two fluid types under the specified simple shear flow.\n\n**1. Incompressible Newtonian Fluid**\n\nThe constitutive relation for the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ in an incompressible fluid is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau} $$\nwhere $p$ is the indeterminate mechanical pressure, $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor, and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the deviatoric (or extra) stress tensor.\n\nFor a generalized Newtonian fluid, the deviatoric stress is a function of the rate-of-deformation tensor $\\mathbf{D}$. The problem specifies a *linear, isotropic* dependence, which defines the incompressible Newtonian fluid model:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = 2\\mu\\mathbf{D} $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the constant dynamic viscosity.\n\nFirst, we compute the velocity gradient tensor, $\\nabla\\mathbf{u}$, from the given velocity field $\\mathbf{u} = (\\dot{\\gamma} y, 0, 0)$:\n$$ \\nabla\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNext, we compute the rate-of-deformation tensor, $\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^\\top)$:\n$$ \\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma}/2 & 0 \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma}/2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNote that $\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{D}) = 0$, consistent with incompressibility.\n\nNow, we find the deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = 2\\mu\\mathbf{D} = 2\\mu \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma}/2 & 0 \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma}/2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\mu\\dot{\\gamma} & 0 \\\\ \\mu\\dot{\\gamma} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe key observation is that all diagonal components of $\\mathbf{D}$, and therefore of $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, are zero: $\\tau_{xx} = \\tau_{yy} = \\tau_{zz} = 0$.\n\nFinally, we construct the full Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} -p & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -p & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -p \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\mu\\dot{\\gamma} & 0 \\\\ \\mu\\dot{\\gamma} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -p & \\mu\\dot{\\gamma} & 0 \\\\ \\mu\\dot{\\gamma} & -p & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -p \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe normal stress components are $\\sigma_{xx} = -p$, $\\sigma_{yy} = -p$, and $\\sigma_{zz} = -p$.\n\nWe can now compute the normal stress differences:\n$$ N_1 = \\sigma_{xx} - \\sigma_{yy} = (-p) - (-p) = 0 $$\n$$ N_2 = \\sigma_{yy} - \\sigma_{zz} = (-p) - (-p) = 0 $$\nTherefore, for an incompressible Newtonian fluid in simple shear, both normal stress differences are identically zero. This is a direct consequence of the linear relationship between $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$, and the fact that $\\mathbf{D}$ has no diagonal components in this flow.\n\n**2. Viscoelastic Fluid**\n\nFor a viscoelastic fluid, the stress is not determined by the instantaneous rate of deformation alone but by the entire history of deformation. This dependency is expressed through an objective (frame-indifferent) memory functional. A material element subjected to steady shear flow experiences continuous deformation and rotation. The fluid's microstructure (e.g., polymer chains, micelles) responds to this sustained kinematic field by stretching and aligning. This alignment and stretching create an anisotropic internal stress state.\n\nIn simple terms, the elastic character of the fluid causes it to store energy during deformation. In steady shear, this leads to a non-isotropic tension in the fluid. The principal axis of this tension is oriented in the quadrant between the flow direction ($x$) and the velocity gradient direction ($y$). This oriented tension has a component in the flow direction, which adds to the normal stress $\\sigma_{xx}$. The tension also affects $\\sigma_{yy}$ and $\\sigma_{zz}$ differently. This anisotropy in the normal stresses results in non-zero normal stress differences.\n- $N_1 > 0$ is a near-universal feature for polymeric fluids and is responsible for phenomena like the Weissenberg (rod-climbing) effect.\n- $N_2$ is typically non-zero, though often smaller in magnitude than $N_1$ and its sign can vary. For many polymer melts and solutions, $N_2 < 0$.\n\nMathematically, objective constitutive models for viscoelastic fluids (e.g., Upper-Convected Maxwell, Giesekus) are inherently nonlinear in the velocity gradient tensor. For example, the steady-state stress for an Upper-Convected Maxwell fluid in simple shear gives $N_1 = 2\\mu\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}^2$ (where $\\lambda$ is the relaxation time) and $N_2 = 0$. More complex models predict a non-zero $N_2$. The key point is that the history dependence and the requirement of objectivity lead to constitutive equations where shear flow generates non-zero diagonal components in the deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, and thus $N_1 \\neq 0$ and/or $N_2 \\neq 0$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In an incompressible Newtonian fluid under simple shear, the symmetric rate-of-deformation tensor has no diagonal components, so the deviatoric stress has only off-diagonal elements; normal stress components reduce to the isotropic pressure and are equal, hence $N_1 = N_2 = 0$. In viscoelastic fluids, history-dependent stress generated by elastic microstructure alignment and stretch under shear produces anisotropic normal components, so $N_1 \\neq 0$ and typically $N_2 \\neq 0$.**\n- The explanation for the Newtonian fluid is perfectly accurate, following the derivation above step-by-step.\n- The explanation for the viscoelastic fluid correctly identifies history dependence, microstructural alignment/stretch, and the resulting anisotropy of normal stresses as the physical origin of non-zero normal stress differences.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Normal stress differences vanish in Newtonian fluids because the pressure is zero in incompressible flow; viscoelastic fluids have nonzero normal stress differences because they are compressible.**\n- The first clause is false. Pressure is not generally zero in an incompressible flow. The normal stress differences vanish because the extra stresses $\\tau_{xx}$, $\\tau_{yy}$, and $\\tau_{zz}$ are all zero and the pressure contribution cancels out.\n- The second clause is false. Viscoelastic fluids do not need to be compressible to exhibit normal stress differences. In fact, most standard viscoelastic models are formulated for incompressible fluids. The effect arises from elasticity and memory, not compressibility.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. For a Newtonian fluid, frame indifference implies all normal stresses are zero in any flow; viscoelasticity breaks frame indifference, yielding nonzero normal stress differences.**\n- The first clause is false. Frame indifference is a principle that restricts the form of a constitutive law. It does not imply that normal stresses must be zero. The normal stresses $\\sigma_{ii}$ are equal to $-p$, which is not generally zero.\n- The second clause is fundamentally false. All physically acceptable constitutive models, for any material, must obey the principle of frame indifference (material objectivity). Viscoelastic models that predict normal stress differences are, by design, frame-indifferent. The non-zero normal stresses are a *consequence* of valid, objective, nonlinear constitutive models.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In a Newtonian fluid, the Cauchy stress depends nonlinearly on $\\dot{\\gamma}$, causing cancellations that make $N_1$ and $N_2$ zero; viscoelastic fluids depend linearly on $\\dot{\\gamma}$, so they produce nonzero normal stress differences.**\n- This statement reverses the actual dependencies. The Newtonian deviatoric stress is *linear* in $\\dot{\\gamma}$ (via $\\mathbf{D}$). The zero normal stress differences are a consequence of this linearity.\n- Viscoelastic phenomena, including non-zero normal stress differences, are inherently *nonlinear*. For instance, $N_1$ often scales with $\\dot{\\gamma}^2$ at low shear rates.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Normal stress differences in Newtonian simple shear vanish only if the second viscosity coefficient is nonzero; in viscoelastic fluids, vanishing second viscosity is what makes normal stress differences nonzero.**\n- The second coefficient of viscosity is relevant only for *compressible* fluids, as it relates stress to the rate of expansion/compression ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$). The problem specifies an *incompressible* fluid, for which $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}=0$, making the second viscosity coefficient entirely irrelevant. The normal stress differences are zero regardless of this coefficient.\n- The second part of the statement is nonsensical, as the concept of a second viscosity coefficient is not the origin of viscoelastic normal stresses.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional, incompressible Newtonian fluid on the periodic square domain $\\Omega = [0,1]^2$, where the deviatoric part of the Cauchy stress is given by $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = 2 \\mu \\mathbf{D}$ and $\\mathbf{D} = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + \\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top})$. The goal is to implement a consistent, cell-centered, second-order accurate approximation of the divergence of the deviatoric stress, namely the operator $\\nabla \\cdot (2 \\mu \\mathbf{D})$, and verify its convergence using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS).\n\nStarting from the fundamental constitutive relation for Newtonian fluids and the definition of $\\mathbf{D}$, derive, implement, and test a discrete approximation for $\\nabla \\cdot (2 \\mu \\mathbf{D})$ that respects the symmetry of $\\mathbf{D}$ and employs a consistent gradient reconstruction via centered finite differences on a uniform grid with periodic boundary conditions. The reconstruction must compute $\\nabla \\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$ at cell centers, and evaluate the divergence of $2 \\mu \\mathbf{D}$ with centered differences.\n\nUse the manufactured incompressible velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(x,y) = (u(x,y), v(x,y))$ with\n$u(x,y) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y)$ and $v(x,y) = -\\cos(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)$, together with a spatially varying viscosity $\\mu(x,y) = 1 + \\alpha \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)$, where $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless amplitude. All variables are dimensionless, and all results must be reported in dimensionless units.\n\nYour task is to:\n- Implement the operator $\\nabla \\cdot (2 \\mu \\mathbf{D})$ using centered differences on a uniform grid of $N \\times N$ cell-centered points with periodic boundary conditions. The grid spacing is $h = 1/N$, with points at $(x_i, y_j) = \\left(\\tfrac{i + 1/2}{N}, \\tfrac{j + 1/2}{N}\\right)$ for integers $i,j \\in \\{0, \\ldots, N-1\\}$.\n- Construct a discrete approximation that first reconstructs $\\nabla \\mathbf{u}$ consistently at cell centers, then assembles $\\mathbf{D}$ at cell centers, and finally computes $\\nabla \\cdot (2 \\mu \\mathbf{D})$ at cell centers via centered differences.\n- Compute the reference (manufactured) continuous field for $\\nabla \\cdot (2 \\mu \\mathbf{D})$ at the same grid points using exact analytical differentiation of $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mu$ (without disclosing any shortcut formulas in the problem statement).\n- Measure the discrete $L^2$ error of the numerical operator against the analytical reference, defined as $\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} \\|\\mathbf{e}\\|_2^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}\\right)^{1/2}$, which in the discrete setting is approximated by $\\left(\\sum_{i,j} \\left((e_x)_{ij}^2 + (e_y)_{ij}^2\\right) h^2\\right)^{1/2}$.\n- Estimate the observed order of accuracy $p$ by fitting a line to $\\log(\\text{error})$ versus $\\log(h)$ over a sequence of grid resolutions using least squares, where the slope is the estimated $p$.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Scenario A (happy path): $\\alpha = 0.5$ and $N \\in \\{16, 32, 64, 128\\}$.\n- Scenario B (boundary condition consistency with constant viscosity): $\\alpha = 0$ and $N \\in \\{16, 32, 64, 128\\}$.\n- Scenario C (edge case with stronger viscosity variation): $\\alpha = 0.9$ and $N \\in \\{16, 32, 64, 128\\}$.\n- Scenario D (degenerate velocity field): $\\mathbf{u} \\equiv \\mathbf{0}$, $\\alpha = 0.7$, and $N = 16$. Report the maximum absolute value of the discrete operator (it should be identically zero in exact arithmetic).\n\nFor Scenarios A–C, report the observed orders $p_A$, $p_B$, and $p_C$ respectively, and boolean indicators $b_A$, $b_B$, and $b_C$ that each equal true if $p \\geq 1.8$ and false otherwise. For Scenario D, report the maximum absolute value $m_D$ of the discrete operator and a boolean $b_D$ that is true if $m_D = 0$.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order $[p_A, p_B, p_C, b_A, b_B, b_C, m_D, b_D]$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation and verification of a second-order accurate, cell-centered finite difference approximation for the divergence of the deviatoric stress tensor, $\\nabla \\cdot (2 \\mu \\mathbf{D})$, for a two-dimensional, incompressible Newtonian fluid on a periodic domain $\\Omega = [0,1]^2$. The verification will be conducted using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS).\n\nFirst, we establish the analytical reference solution. The deviatoric stress tensor is defined as $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = 2 \\mu \\mathbf{D}$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $\\mathbf{D}$ is the rate-of-strain tensor, $\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^{\\top})$. The manufactured velocity field is $\\mathbf{u}(x,y) = (u(x,y), v(x,y))$ with components $u(x,y) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y)$ and $v(x,y) = -\\cos(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)$. The viscosity is given by $\\mu(x,y) = 1 + \\alpha \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant.\n\nThe gradient of the velocity field, $\\nabla \\mathbf{u}$, is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\pi \\cos(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y) & -\\pi \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) \\\\ \\pi \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) & -\\pi \\cos(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rate-of-strain tensor $\\mathbf{D}$ is then:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^{\\top}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} & \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\right) \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right) & \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting the derivatives, we find:\n$D_{xx} = \\pi \\cos(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y)$\n$D_{yy} = -\\pi \\cos(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y)$\n$D_{xy} = D_{yx} = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\pi \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) + \\pi \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)) = 0$\nAs expected for an incompressible flow, the trace of $\\mathbf{D}$ is $\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{D}) = D_{xx} + D_{yy} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$.\n\nThe deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = 2\\mu\\mathbf{D}$ has components:\n$\\tau_{xx} = 2\\mu D_{xx} = 2\\pi\\mu(x,y)\\cos(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y)$\n$\\tau_{yy} = 2\\mu D_{yy} = -2\\pi\\mu(x,y)\\cos(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y)$\n$\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{yx} = 0$\n\nThe divergence of the stress tensor, $\\mathbf{f} = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, is a vector with components $(f_x, f_y)$:\n$f_x = \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xy}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( 2\\pi(1 + \\alpha \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y))\\cos(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y) \\right)$\n$f_y = \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yy}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( -2\\pi(1 + \\alpha \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y))\\cos(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y) \\right)$\nCarrying out the differentiation using the product rule yields the analytical reference solution:\n$$\nf_x(x,y) = \\pi^2 \\alpha \\cos(2\\pi x)\\sin(2\\pi y) - 2\\pi^2 \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y)\n$$\n$$\nf_y(x,y) = 2\\pi^2 \\cos(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) - \\pi^2 \\alpha \\sin(2\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi y)\n$$\nThese expressions will be evaluated at the grid points to serve as the exact solution for the error analysis.\n\nNext, we design the numerical approximation. The domain is discretized into a uniform grid of $N \\times N$ cells, with cell centers at $(x_i, y_j) = ( (i+0.5)h, (j+0.5)h )$ for $i,j \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$, where $h=1/N$. We use second-order centered finite difference operators for spatial derivatives. For a generic field $\\phi$ on the grid, the partial derivatives are approximated as:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right)_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{\\phi_{i+1,j} - \\phi_{i-1,j}}{2h}, \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right)_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{\\phi_{i,j+1} - \\phi_{i,j-1}}{2h}\n$$\nPeriodic boundary conditions are handled by taking indices modulo $N$. The numerical procedure follows the specified sequence:\n1.  Evaluate the velocity components $u$ and $v$ and the viscosity $\\mu$ at all cell centers $(x_i, y_j)$.\n2.  Compute the discrete velocity gradient components ($\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$) at cell centers using the centered difference formulas.\n3.  Assemble the discrete rate-of-strain tensor $\\mathbf{D}_{ij}$ at each cell center from the discrete velocity gradient components.\n4.  Assemble the discrete deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{ij}$ by element-wise multiplication: $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{ij} = 2 \\mu_{ij} \\mathbf{D}_{ij}$.\n5.  Compute the discrete divergence of the stress tensor at each cell center using the centered difference formulas applied to the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{ij}$. This yields the final numerical result, a discrete vector field $(\\mathbf{f}_h)_{ij}$.\n\nTo verify convergence, we compute the discrete $L^2$ error between the numerical approximation $\\mathbf{f}_h$ and the analytical solution $\\mathbf{f}$. The error vector at each grid point is $\\mathbf{e}_{ij} = (\\mathbf{f}_h)_{ij} - \\mathbf{f}(x_i, y_j)$. The discrete $L^2$ norm of the error is:\n$$\nL^2 \\text{ error} = \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\left( (e_x)_{ij}^2 + (e_y)_{ij}^2 \\right) h^2 \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nThe theoretical convergence rate for a second-order scheme is $\\text{Error} \\approx C h^p$ with $p=2$. To estimate the observed order of accuracy $p$, we compute the error for a sequence of grid resolutions ($h_k = 1/N_k$). Taking the logarithm gives $\\log(\\text{Error}) \\approx \\log(C) + p \\log(h)$. The slope $p$ is estimated via a linear least-squares fit to the data points $(\\log(h_k), \\log(\\text{Error}_k))$.\n\nFinally, a test with a degenerate velocity field $\\mathbf{u} \\equiv \\mathbf{0}$ serves as a sanity check. In this case, $\\nabla\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{0}$, $\\mathbf{D}=\\mathbf{0}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}=\\mathbf{0}$, and $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{0}$. A consistent discrete operator should reproduce this result to machine precision, meaning the computed discrete divergence should be identically zero.",
