            "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional flow representative of rigid-body rotation in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Let the velocity field be $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x},t)=\\left(y,-x\\right)$ in the plane, where $\\mathbf{x}=(x,y)$, and let a nondimensional scalar field be $\\phi(\\mathbf{x},t)=x^{2}+y^{2}+t$.

Treat $\\phi$ as nondimensional; no units are required. Provide the final value of $D\\phi/Dt$ as a single exact number or closed-form expression. No rounding is needed.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and evaluation of the material derivative, $\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt}$, for a given two-dimensional velocity field $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = (y, -x)$ and a scalar field $\\phi(\\mathbf{x}, t) = x^2 + y^2 + t$. The position vector is $\\mathbf{x}=(x,y)$. The derivation must proceed from the fundamental definitions of a fluid particle trajectory and the material derivative as a total derivative along this trajectory.\n\nA fluid particle's trajectory, denoted by the vector function $\\mathbf{X}(t) = (X(t), Y(t))$, is determined by the velocity field. The particle's velocity at any time $t$ is equal to the fluid velocity at the particle's location $\\mathbf{X}(t)$. This relationship is expressed by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{X}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{X}(t), t)\n$$\nThe material derivative of the scalar field $\\phi$, denoted $\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt}$, is defined as the time rate of change of $\\phi$ as experienced by an observer moving with a fluid particle. Mathematically, this is the total derivative of the composite function $\\phi(\\mathbf{X}(t), t)$ with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\phi(\\mathbf{X}(t), t)\n$$\nTo find this total derivative, we apply the multivariate chain rule. The function $\\phi$ depends on time $t$ explicitly, and also implicitly through the particle coordinates $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$, which are themselves functions of $t$. The chain rule yields:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial X}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}X}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial Y}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Y}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\nFrom the definition of the particle trajectory, the components of its velocity are given by the components of the fluid velocity field, $\\mathbf{v} = (u,v)$, evaluated at the particle's position:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}X}{\\mathrm{d}t} = u(X(t), Y(t), t) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Y}{\\mathrm{d}t} = v(X(t), Y(t), t)\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the chain rule equation, and recognizing that $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 1$, we obtain the expression for the material derivative in terms of the field variables:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t} + u\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial X} + v\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial Y}\n$$\nThis expression is typically written in the Eulerian frame of reference, using the spatial coordinates $(x,y)$ rather than the Lagrangian particle coordinates $(X,Y)$. In vector notation, this is:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the material derivative, which was derived as required. It consists of two parts: the local rate of change, $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t}$, which is the change observed at a fixed point in space, and the advective (or convective) rate of change, $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi$, which is the change due to the particle's motion into a region with a different value of $\\phi$.\n\nWe now evaluate this expression for the specific fields given in the problem:\n- Velocity field: $\\mathbf{v}(x,y) = (y, -x)$, so the components are $u=y$ and $v=-x$.\n- Scalar field: $\\phi(x,y,t) = x^2 + y^2 + t$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the local rate of change of $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(x^2 + y^2 + t) = 1\n$$\nNext, we calculate the gradient of $\\phi$, $\\nabla\\phi$:\n$$\n\\nabla\\phi = \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 + y^2 + t), \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2 + y^2 + t)\\right) = (2x, 2y)\n$$\nNow, we compute the advective term, $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi = (u, v) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}\\right) = (y, -x) \\cdot (2x, 2y) = y(2x) + (-x)(2y) = 2xy - 2xy = 0\n$$\nFinally, we combine the local and advective terms to find the material derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi = 1 + 0 = 1\n$$\nThe value of the material derivative is $1$.\n\nFor the geometric interpretation, we must explain why the advective contribution, $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi$, vanishes. The advective term being zero implies that the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is orthogonal to the gradient vector $\\nabla\\phi$ at every point in the flow.\n\nLet's analyze the geometry of these vector fields.\nThe scalar field at any fixed time $t_0$ is $\\phi(x,y,t_0) = x^2 + y^2 + t_0$. The spatial variation is given by $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$. The level sets of this function, where $f(x,y)$ is constant, are circles centered at the origin, described by the equation $x^2 + y^2 = C$ for some constant $C$.\nThe gradient of $\\phi$, $\\nabla\\phi = (2x, 2y)$, is a vector that is always directed radially outward from the origin. The gradient vector is always perpendicular to the level sets of the function.\n\nThe velocity field, $\\mathbf{v} = (y, -x)$, describes a rigid-body rotation around the origin. We can verify that the velocity vector at any point $\\mathbf{r}=(x,y)$ is tangent to the circle passing through that point. The position vector $\\mathbf{r}=(x,y)$ is radial. The dot product of the position vector and the velocity vector is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = (x,y) \\cdot (y, -x) = xy - yx = 0\n$$\nSince their dot product is zero, the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is always orthogonal to the position vector $\\mathbf{r}$.\nWe have established that $\\nabla\\phi$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{r}$, and $\\mathbf{v}$ is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{r}$. It follows directly that $\\mathbf{v}$ is orthogonal to $\\nabla\\phi$.\n\nThis orthogonality has a clear physical meaning. The fluid particles, which follow the velocity vectors $\\mathbf{v}$, move along trajectories that are tangent to the level sets of the spatial part of $\\phi$. In this case, the particles move in circles, and on any given circle, the value of $x^2+y^2$ is constant. Because a particle's motion does not transport it to a location with a different value of $x^2+y^2$, there is no change in $\\phi$ due to advection. The particle experiences change in $\\phi$ only because $\\phi$ itself is explicitly changing with time.\n\nTherefore, the total change observed by the particle, $\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt}$, is solely due to the local rate of change, $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t} = 1$. The advective contribution is zero because the flow is directed purely along the isosurfaces of the spatial component of the scalar field.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution without any contradictions.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as specified.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Streamline Invariant**\n\nBy definition (i), a streamline is a curve $\\mathbf{x}(s) = (x(s), y(s))$ in the plane, parameterized by a variable $s$, such that its tangent vector $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}}{\\mathrm{d}s}$ is everywhere parallel to the velocity field $\\mathbf{v}(x,y)$. This condition of parallelism can be expressed via the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{v_y(x,y)}{v_x(x,y)}\n$$\nThe given velocity field is $\\mathbf{v}(x,y) = (y, -x)$, with components $v_x = y$ and $v_y = -x$. Substituting these into the differential equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{-x}{y}\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange the terms to separate the variables $x$ and $y$:\n$$\ny \\, \\mathrm{d}y = -x \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nIntegrating both sides of the equation yields:\n$$\n\\int y \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\int -x \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}y^{2} = -\\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + C'\n$$\nwhere $C'$ is an arbitrary constant of integration. To simplify, we can multiply by $2$ and rearrange the equation to place all variables on one side:\n$$\nx^{2} + y^{2} = 2C'\n$$\nLetting $C = 2C'$, we find that the family of streamlines is described by the equation $x^{2} + y^{2} = C$, where each value of the constant $C  0$ defines a specific streamline, which is a circle centered at the origin.\n\nAn invariant $S(x,y)$ is a function that remains constant along each streamline. From the equation of the family of streamlines, we can directly identify this invariant as:\n$$\nS(x,y) = x^{2} + y^{2}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Pathline**\n\nBy definition (ii), a pathline is the trajectory $\\mathbf{x}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$ of a fluid particle over time $t$. It is governed by the system of differential equations $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x}(t), t)$. Since the flow is time-independent (steady), this becomes $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x}(t))$.\n\nFor the given velocity field $\\mathbf{v} = (y, -x)$, the system of ordinary differential equations for the pathline components is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = y(t) \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -x(t) \\quad (2)\n$$\nTo solve this coupled system, we can differentiate equation (1) with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}x}{\\mathrm{d}t^{2}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\nSubstituting equation (2) into this result eliminates $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}x}{\\mathrm{d}t^{2}} = -x(t)\n$$\nThis gives a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}x}{\\mathrm{d}t^{2}} + x(t) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution for this simple harmonic oscillator equation is:\n$$\nx(t) = A \\cos(t) + B \\sin(t)\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined by the initial conditions. We can find $y(t)$ by substituting this solution for $x(t)$ back into equation (1):\n$$\ny(t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\big( A \\cos(t) + B \\sin(t) \\big) = -A \\sin(t) + B \\cos(t)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the initial condition at $t=0$ as $(x(0), y(0)) = (1, 0)$. We apply these conditions:\nFor $x(0)$:\n$$\n1 = x(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A(1) + B(0) = A\n$$\nSo, $A=1$.\nFor $y(0)$:\n$$\n0 = y(0) = -A \\sin(0) + B \\cos(0) = -A(0) + B(1) = B\n$$\nSo, $B=0$.\nSubstituting $A=1$ and $B=0$ into the general solutions for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, we obtain the specific pathline:\n$$\nx(t) = \\cos(t)\n$$\n$$\ny(t) = -\\sin(t)\n$$\nThe parametric trajectory is thus $\\mathbf{x}(t) = (\\cos(t), -\\sin(t))$.\n\n**Part 3: Material Derivative and Interpretation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the material derivative of the scalar field $\\phi(x,y) = r^{2}(x,y) = x^{2}+y^{2}$. By definition (iii), the material derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi\n$$\nThe field $\\phi = x^{2}+y^{2}$ has no explicit dependence on time $t$, so the local time derivative term is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = 0\n$$\nNext, we compute the gradient of $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\nabla\\phi = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^{2}+y^{2}), \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^{2}+y^{2}) \\right) = (2x, 2y)\n$$\nThe advective term, $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi$, is the dot product of the velocity field $\\mathbf{v} = (y, -x)$ and the gradient $\\nabla\\phi$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi = (y, -x) \\cdot (2x, 2y) = (y)(2x) + (-x)(2y) = 2xy - 2xy = 0\n$$\nCombining the terms, the material derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{D(r^{2})}{Dt} = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\n**Interpretation:** The material derivative $\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt}$ represents the total rate of change of a property $\\phi$ experienced by a fluid particle as it moves along its pathline. In this case, $\\phi = r^{2} = x^{2}+y^{2}$ is the square of the particle's distance from the origin.\n\nThe result $\\frac{D(r^{2})}{Dt} = 0$ signifies that for any fluid particle, its squared distance from the origin is a conserved quantity; it does not change with time. This forces every particle to travel along a path of constant radius, i.e., a circle centered at the origin.\n\nThe geometric relationship is now clear. In Part 1, we found that the streamlines are the family of curves $S(x,y) = x^{2}+y^{2} = \\text{constant}$, which are circles centered at the origin. In Part 3, we have shown from first principles that the quantity $x^{2}+y^{2}$ is conserved along any pathline. This means that pathlines are constrained to lie on the very same family of curves that define the streamlines.\n\nFor this steady (time-independent) flow, the pathlines and streamlines are therefore identical. The specific pathline found in Part 2, $(x(t), y(t)) = (\\cos(t), -\\sin(t))$, satisfies $x^{2}+y^{2} = \\cos^{2}(t) + (-\\sin(t))^{2} = 1$, which corresponds to the streamline $S(x,y)=1$.",

It is found by integrating the differential equations $d\\mathbf{x}_p/dt = \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x}_p(t), t)$ with a given initial condition.\nThe system of ODEs is:\n$1.$ $\\dfrac{dx}{dt} = v_x(x,y,t) = U + \\beta t$\n$2.$ $\\dfrac{dy}{dt} = v_y(x,y,t) = \\gamma x(t)$\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = 0$ and $y(0) = 0$.\n\nIntegrating the first equation from $t'=0$ to $t'=t$:\n$$x(t) - x(0) = \\int_{0}^{t} (U + \\beta t') dt'$$\n$$x(t) = \\left[ Ut' + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta t'^2 \\right]_{0}^{t} = Ut + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta t^2$$\nThis matches the expression for $x(t)$ in the option.\n\nNext, we substitute this result for $x(t)$ into the second equation:\n$$\\dfrac{dy}{dt} = \\gamma \\left( Ut + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta t^2 \\right)$$\nIntegrating from $t'=0$ to $t'=t$:\n$$y(t) - y(0) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\gamma \\left( Ut' + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta t'^2 \\right) dt'$$\n$$y(t) = \\gamma \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}Ut'^2 + \\frac{1}{6}\\beta t'^3 \\right]_{0}^{t} = \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma Ut^2 + \\frac{1}{6}\\gamma \\beta t^3$$\nThis matches the expression for $y(t)$ in the option. Both expressions are correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. The streamline at time $t=T$ passing through the instantaneous particle position $(x_p,y_p)$ at $t=T$ has equation $y_s(x) = y_p + \\dfrac{\\gamma}{2\\left(U+\\beta T\\right)}\\left(x^2 - x_p^2\\right)$.**\n\nA streamline at a fixed time $T$ is a curve tangent to the instantaneous velocity field $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x}, T)$. The equation for a streamline $y_s(x)$ is given by:\n$$\\dfrac{dy_s}{dx} = \\dfrac{v_y(x,y,T)}{v_x(x,y,T)} = \\dfrac{\\gamma x}{U + \\beta T}$$\nThis is a separable ODE. We integrate it to find the equation of the streamline passing through the point $(x_p, y_p)$:\n$$\\int_{y_p}^{y_s(x)} dy' = \\int_{x_p}^{x} \\frac{\\gamma x'}{U + \\beta T} dx'$$\n$$y_s(x) - y_p = \\frac{\\gamma}{U + \\beta T} \\left[ \\frac{x'^2}{2} \\right]_{x_p}^{x}$$\n$$y_s(x) - y_p = \\frac{\\gamma}{2(U + \\beta T)} (x^2 - x_p^2)$$\n$$y_s(x) = y_p + \\frac{\\gamma}{2(U + \\beta T)} (x^2 - x_p^2)$$\nThis equation matches the one provided in the option.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. At time $t=T$, the second derivative with respect to $x$ of the pathline evaluated at the particle’s position is $\\dfrac{d^2 y}{dx^2}\\big|_{\\text{pathline},\\,t=T} = \\dfrac{\\gamma}{U+\\beta T}\\left(1 - \\dfrac{\\beta x_p}{\\left(U+\\beta T\\right)^2}\\right)$, whereas the second derivative of the streamline through $(x_p,y_p)$ at time $t=T$ is $\\dfrac{d^2 y}{dx^2}\\big|_{\\text{streamline},\\,t=T} = \\dfrac{\\gamma}{U+\\beta T}$, so their difference equals $-\\dfrac{\\gamma \\beta x_p}{\\left(U+\\beta T\\right)^3}$.**\n\nFirst, let's find the second derivative for the streamline. From option C, a streamline at time $t=T$ has the slope:\n$$\\dfrac{dy_s}{dx} = \\dfrac{\\gamma x}{U + \\beta T}$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $x$:\n$$\\dfrac{d^2 y_s}{dx^2} = \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left(\\dfrac{\\gamma x}{U + \\beta T}\\right) = \\dfrac{\\gamma}{U + \\beta T}$$\nThis matches the expression for the streamline's second derivative in the option.\n\nNext, let's find the second derivative for the pathline. The pathline is given parametrically by $(x(t), y(t))$. The first derivative $\\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ is:\n$$\\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \\dfrac{dy/dt}{dx/dt} = \\dfrac{\\gamma x(t)}{U+\\beta t}$$\nThe second derivative $\\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ is found using the chain rule:\n$$\\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left(\\dfrac{dy}{dx}\\right) = \\dfrac{d/dt(dy/dx)}{dx/dt}$$\nLet's compute the numerator, $\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\dfrac{\\gamma x(t)}{U+\\beta t}\\right)$, using the quotient rule:\n$$\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\dfrac{\\gamma x(t)}{U+\\beta t}\\right) = \\gamma \\dfrac{(dx/dt)(U+\\beta t) - x(t)(\\beta)}{(U+\\beta t)^2}$$\nSubstitute $dx/dt = U+\\beta t$:\n$$= \\gamma \\dfrac{(U+\\beta t)(U+\\beta t) - \\beta x(t)}{(U+\\beta t)^2} = \\gamma \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\beta x(t)}{(U+\\beta t)^2} \\right)$$\nNow, divide by $dx/dt = U+\\beta t$:\n$$\\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\dfrac{\\gamma \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\beta x(t)}{(U+\\beta t)^2} \\right)}{U+\\beta t} = \\dfrac{\\gamma}{U+\\beta t}\\left(1 - \\dfrac{\\beta x(t)}{(U+\\beta t)^2}\\right)$$\nWe evaluate this at time $t=T$. At this time, the particle is at position $x(T) = x_p$.\n$$\\dfrac{d^2 y}{dx^2}\\bigg|_{\\text{pathline},\\,t=T} = \\dfrac{\\gamma}{U+\\beta T}\\left(1 - \\dfrac{\\beta x_p}{(U+\\beta T)^2}\\right)$$\nThis matches the expression for the pathline's second derivative in the option.\n\nFinally, we compute the difference:\n$$ \\left( \\dfrac{d^2 y}{dx^2}\\bigg|_{\\text{pathline}} - \\dfrac{d^2 y}{dx^2}\\bigg|_{\\text{streamline}} \\right) \\bigg|_{t=T} = \\left[ \\dfrac{\\gamma}{U+\\beta T}\\left(1 - \\dfrac{\\beta x_p}{(U+\\beta T)^2}\\right) \\right] - \\left[ \\dfrac{\\gamma}{U+\\beta T} \\right] $$\n$$ = \\dfrac{\\gamma}{U+\\beta T} - \\dfrac{\\gamma \\beta x_p}{(U+\\beta T)^3} - \\dfrac{\\gamma}{U+\\beta T} = -\\dfrac{\\gamma \\beta x_p}{(U+\\beta T)^3} $$\nThis result matches the difference stated in the option.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. For the streakline at time $t=T$ generated by continuous release at the origin, the local slope $\\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ at the point on the streakline labeled by its release time $\\tau \\in [0,T]$ equals $\\gamma\\,(T-\\tau)$, showing that streakline tangents are generically not aligned with the instantaneous velocity direction except at the trivial endpoint corresponding to $\\tau = T$.**\n\nA streakline at time $T$ is the locus of particles that passed through $(0,0)$ at earlier times $\\tau \\in [0,T]$. We need the position at time $t=T$ of a particle released from $(0,0)$ at time $\\tau$. Let this position be $\\mathbf{x}_{str}(T; \\tau) = (x_{str}, y_{str})$. This is a pathline problem with initial condition $\\mathbf{x}(\\tau) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nSolving for $x_{str}$:\n$$x_{str}(T; \\tau) = x(\\tau) + \\int_\\tau^T (U + \\beta t') dt' = 0 + \\left[ Ut' + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta t'^2 \\right]_\\tau^T = U(T-\\tau) + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta(T^2-\\tau^2)$$\nSolving for $y_{str}$:\n$$\\dfrac{dy}{dt} = \\gamma x(t) = \\gamma \\left( U(t-\\tau) + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta(t^2-\\tau^2) \\right)$$\n$$y_{str}(T; \\tau) = y(\\tau) + \\int_\\tau^T \\gamma \\left( U(t'-\\tau) + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta(t'^2-\\tau^2) \\right) dt'$$\n$$= \\gamma \\left[ U\\left(\\frac{t'^2}{2} - \\tau t'\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta\\left(\\frac{t'^3}{3} - \\tau^2 t'\\right) \\right]_\\tau^T$$\nAfter a lengthy but direct algebraic simplification, an easier way to find the slope is to find the tangent vector to the streakline, which is $\\dfrac{d\\mathbf{x}_{str}}{d\\tau}$.\n$$\\dfrac{dx_{str}}{d\\tau} = \\dfrac{d}{d\\tau} \\left( UT - U\\tau + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta T^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\tau^2 \\right) = -U - \\beta\\tau = -v_x(x=0, y=0, t=\\tau)$$\n$$\\dfrac{dy_{str}}{d\\tau} = \\dfrac{d}{d\\tau} \\left( \\int_\\tau^T \\gamma x(t'; \\tau) dt' \\right) = -\\gamma x(\\tau; \\tau) + \\int_\\tau^T \\gamma \\dfrac{\\partial x(t'; \\tau)}{\\partial \\tau} dt'$$\nUsing Leibniz integral rule: $x(\\tau;\\tau)=0$. And $\\dfrac{\\partial x(t';\\tau)}{\\partial\\tau} = \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial\\tau} \\left(U(t'-\\tau) + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta(t'^2-\\tau^2)\\right) = -U-\\beta\\tau$.\n$$\\dfrac{dy_{str}}{d\\tau} = \\int_\\tau^T \\gamma (-U-\\beta\\tau) dt' = -\\gamma(U+\\beta\\tau) \\int_\\tau^T dt' = -\\gamma(U+\\beta\\tau)(T-\\tau)$$\nThe slope of the streakline is $\\dfrac{dy_{str}}{dx_{str}} = \\dfrac{dy_{str}/d\\tau}{dx_ {str}/d\\tau}$:\n$$\\dfrac{dy_{str}}{dx_{str}} = \\dfrac{-\\gamma(U+\\beta\\tau)(T-\\tau)}{-(U+\\beta\\tau)} = \\gamma(T-\\tau)$$\nThis matches the first part of the option.\n\nNow we compare this to the slope of the instantaneous streamline at the same point $(x_{str}, y_{str})$ at time $T$. The streamline slope is $\\dfrac{v_y}{v_x} = \\dfrac{\\gamma x_{str}}{U+\\beta T}$.\nWe check if $\\gamma(T-\\tau) = \\dfrac{\\gamma x_{str}}{U+\\beta T}$.\n$$\\gamma(T-\\tau) \\stackrel{?}{=} \\dfrac{\\gamma \\left( U(T-\\tau) + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta(T^2-\\tau^2) \\right)}{U+\\beta T}$$\nAssuming $T \\ne \\tau$ and $\\gamma \\ne 0$, we can divide by $\\gamma(T-\\tau)$:\n$$1 \\stackrel{?}{=} \\dfrac{U + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta(T+\\tau)}{U+\\beta T}$$\n$$U+\\beta T \\stackrel{?}{=} U + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta T + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\tau$$\n$$\\beta T \\stackrel{?}{=} \\frac{1}{2}\\beta T + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\tau \\implies \\frac{1}{2}\\beta T \\stackrel{?}{=} \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\tau \\implies T \\stackrel{?}{=} \\tau$$\nThe equality only holds if $\\tau = T$. This is the release point itself, where the particle has just been emitted. For any $\\tau  T$, a particle on the streakline has a tangent that is not aligned with the local instantaneous velocity field. The statement is correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**F. Because the Eulerian divergence $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ is zero, the streakline at time $t=T$ coincides with the instantaneous streamline field everywhere at that time.**\n\nThis is incorrect. As shown in the analysis for option A, the condition for streaklines and streamlines to coincide is that the flow is steady. The given flow is unsteady. The logic in option E explicitly proved that the streakline slope $\\gamma(T-\\tau)$ is not equal to the streamline slope $\\dfrac{\\gamma x_{str}}{U+\\beta T}$ for $\\tau  T$. The premise \"Because the Eulerian divergence is zero\" is a red herring; incompressibility does not cause these lines to coincide in an unsteady flow.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
