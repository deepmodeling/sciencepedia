            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a direct application of the Cauchy stress principle, a fundamental concept in continuum mechanics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe relationship between the Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, at a point in a continuum and the traction vector, $\\mathbf{t}$, acting on an infinitesimal surface element passing through that point is given by Cauchy's relation. This relation states that the traction vector is the result of the action of the stress tensor on the unit normal vector, $\\mathbf{n}$, of the surface:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}\n$$\nIn Cartesian coordinates, this matrix-vector equation can be written in component form using the Einstein summation convention as $t_i = \\sigma_{ij}n_j$, for $i,j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThe problem provides the Cauchy stress tensor:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere all components are in units of Pascals. The unit normal vector to the plane is given as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n} = (1, 0, 0)\n$$\nWe can represent $\\mathbf{n}$ as a column vector for matrix multiplication:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the traction vector $\\mathbf{t} = (t_x, t_y, t_z)$ by performing the multiplication $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (2)(1) + (1)(0) + (0)(0) \\\\ (1)(1) + (3)(0) + (0)(0) \\\\ (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (-1)(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the traction vector is $\\mathbf{t} = (2, 1, 0)$ Pascals. The components are $t_x = 2$, $t_y = 1$, and $t_z = 0$.\n\nNext, we decompose the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ into its normal and tangential components relative to the unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$.\n\nThe normal component, $t_n$, is the scalar projection of $\\mathbf{t}$ onto $\\mathbf{n}$. This is calculated using the dot product:\n$$\nt_n = \\mathbf{t} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = (2, 1, 0) \\cdot (1, 0, 0) = (2)(1) + (1)(0) + (0)(0) = 2\n$$\nThe normal component of the traction is $t_n = 2$ Pascals.\n\nThe tangential component is a vector, $\\mathbf{t}_t$, which is the part of $\\mathbf{t}$ that lies in the plane defined by $\\mathbf{n}$. It is found by subtracting the vector projection of $\\mathbf{t}$ onto $\\mathbf{n}$ from $\\mathbf{t}$ itself. The vector projection of $\\mathbf{t}$ onto $\\mathbf{n}$ is $(t_n)\\mathbf{n}$. The formula for the tangential component is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t}_t = \\mathbf{t} - (t_n)\\mathbf{n}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t}_t = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - (2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2-2 \\\\ 1-0 \\\\ 0-0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the tangential component vector is $\\mathbf{t}_t = (0, 1, 0)$ Pascals. Its components are $(t_t)_x = 0$, $(t_t)_y = 1$, and $(t_t)_z = 0$. As a necessary check, the tangential component must be orthogonal to the normal vector: $\\mathbf{t}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = (0,1,0) \\cdot (1,0,0) = 0$, which is confirmed.\n\nFinally, we assemble the required components into a single row matrix as specified:\n$$\n\\big[t_{x},\\, t_{y},\\, t_{z},\\, t_{n},\\, (t_{t})_{x},\\, (t_{t})_{y},\\, (t_{t})_{z}\\big]\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values, we have:\n- $t_{x} = 2$\n- $t_{y} = 1$\n- $t_{z} = 0$\n- $t_{n} = 2$\n- $(t_{t})_{x} = 0$\n- $(t_{t})_{y} = 1$\n- $(t_{t})_{z} = 0$\n\nThe final result is the row matrix containing these seven numerical values.",
