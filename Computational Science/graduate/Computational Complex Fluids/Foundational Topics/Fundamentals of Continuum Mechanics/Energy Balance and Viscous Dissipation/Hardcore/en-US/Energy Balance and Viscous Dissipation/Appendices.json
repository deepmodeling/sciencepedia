            "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional thin Newtonian film of an incompressible fluid with constant viscosity $\\mu$ and density $\\rho$, coating a rigid flat substrate located at $z=0$. The free surface is located at $z=h$, where $h$ is spatially uniform and satisfies $h \\ll L$ for some in-plane length scale $L$, so that lubrication scaling applies with aspect ratio $\\epsilon = h/L \\ll 1$. The flow is steady, inertia is negligible (creeping flow), and the film is driven by a constant in-plane pressure gradient $\\partial p/\\partial x$ in the $x$-direction. Gravity and surface tension gradients are negligible for the purpose of this calculation. The substrate imposes a no-slip and no-penetration condition at $z=0$, and the free surface is stress-free at $z=h$. \n\nStarting only from the incompressible Stokes (creeping) momentum equations, the lubrication-order kinematics, and the definition of the viscous dissipation density per unit volume $\\phi = 2 \\mu \\mathbf{D}:\\mathbf{D}$, where $\\mathbf{D} = (\\nabla \\mathbf{v} + \\nabla \\mathbf{v}^{\\mathsf{T}})/2$ is the rate-of-strain tensor and $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity field, derive the leading-order expression for the viscous dissipation density integrated across the film thickness, that is, the dissipation per unit area,\n$$\n\\Phi_{A} \\equiv \\int_{0}^{h} \\phi(z) \\, dz,\n$$\nin terms of $\\mu$, $h$, and $\\partial p/\\partial x$.

Express the dissipation per unit area in the International System of Units (SI) as Watts per square meter. No numerical substitution is required, and no rounding is needed.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the total viscous dissipation per unit area, $\\Phi_{A}$, in a thin, gravity-free Newtonian film driven by a constant pressure gradient. The derivation will start from the fundamental equations of creeping flow and utilize the lubrication approximation.\n\nThe governing equations for a steady, incompressible, creeping flow (negligible inertia) of a Newtonian fluid are the Stokes equations:\n$$\n\\nabla p = \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $\\mu$ is the constant viscosity, and $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity field.\n\nThe flow is considered two-dimensional in the $(x, z)$ plane, with the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v} = (u, w)$. The geometry is defined by a substrate at $z=0$ and a free surface at $z=h$. The thin-film nature of the problem is captured by the lubrication scaling, where the aspect ratio $\\epsilon = h/L \\ll 1$, with $L$ being a characteristic length scale in the $x$-direction. The scaling of derivatives follows as $\\partial/\\partial x \\sim 1/L$ and $\\partial/\\partial z \\sim 1/h$.\n\nThe continuity equation $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0$ implies that the velocity scales are related by $W/h \\sim U/L$, or $W \\sim (h/L)U = \\epsilon U$, where $U$ and $W$ are characteristic velocities in the $x$ and $z$ directions, respectively. This confirms that the vertical velocity component is much smaller than the horizontal one ($w \\ll u$).\n\nThe components of the Stokes equation are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial z^2} \\right)\n$$\nApplying the lubrication approximation, we compare the magnitudes of the terms. In the $x$-momentum equation, $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\sim \\frac{U}{L^2}$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} \\sim \\frac{U}{h^2}$. Since $h \\ll L$, we have $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\ll \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}$. Thus, the first leading-order approximation is to simplify the $x$-momentum equation to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nIn the $z$-momentum equation, a similar scaling analysis shows that all terms are smaller than those in the $x$-momentum equation by a factor of $\\epsilon$. This leads to the second leading-order approximation: the pressure gradient across the thin film is negligible, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} \\approx 0$. This implies that the pressure $p$ is a function of $x$ only, i.e., $p=p(x)$. Since the problem states that $\\partial p/\\partial x$ is a constant, we can write $\\frac{dp}{dx}$.\n\nAs the problem specifies a spatially uniform film thickness $h$ and a constant pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$, the flow is fully developed, meaning the velocity profile does not change with $x$. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$. From the continuity equation, this implies $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0$. Given the no-penetration boundary condition at the substrate, $w(z=0)=0$, we conclude that $w(z)=0$ everywhere. The velocity field is purely one-dimensional: $\\mathbf{v} = (u(z), 0)$.\n\nWe can now solve for the velocity profile $u(z)$ by integrating the simplified $x$-momentum equation twice with respect to $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u}{dz^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}\n$$\nFirst integration yields:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dz} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} z + C_1\n$$\nSecond integration yields:\n$$\nu(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} z^2 + C_1 z + C_2\n$$\nThe integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by the boundary conditions.\n1.  No-slip condition at the substrate ($z=0$): $u(0)=0$. Substituting this into the equation for $u(z)$ gives $C_2=0$.\n2.  Stress-free condition at the free surface ($z=h$). The shear stress component is $\\tau_{zx} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} \\right)$. With $w=0$, this simplifies to $\\tau_{zx} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dz}$. The condition $\\tau_{zx}|_{z=h}=0$ implies $\\mu \\frac{du}{dz}|_{z=h}=0$. Substituting $z=h$ into the expression for $\\frac{du}{dz}$:\n$$\n\\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} h + C_1 \\right) = 0 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{h}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting the constants back into the expression for $u(z)$, we obtain the velocity profile:\n$$\nu(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} z^2 - \\frac{h}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} z = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (z^2 - 2hz)\n$$\nThe viscous dissipation density per unit volume is given by $\\phi = 2\\mu \\mathbf{D}:\\mathbf{D}$, where $\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\mathbf{v} + \\nabla \\mathbf{v}^{\\mathsf{T}})$ is the rate-of-strain tensor. For the velocity field $\\mathbf{v} = (u(z), 0)$, the only non-zero component of the velocity gradient is $\\frac{du}{dz}$. The rate-of-strain tensor is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dz} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dz}  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe double dot product $\\mathbf{D}:\\mathbf{D}$ is the sum of the squares of its components:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D}:\\mathbf{D} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dz}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dz}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dz}\\right)^2\n$$\nThis is the third key leading-order approximation consistent with lubrication theory: dissipation is dominated by the strong shear across the thin film.\nThe dissipation density becomes:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = 2\\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dz}\\right)^2 \\right) = \\mu \\left(\\frac{du}{dz}\\right)^2\n$$\nFrom the velocity profile, we find the velocity gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dz} = \\frac{d}{dz} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (z^2 - 2hz) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (2z - 2h) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (z - h)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\phi(z)$:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = \\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (z - h) \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right)^2 (z-h)^2\n$$\nThe dissipation per unit area, $\\Phi_{A}$, is the integral of the dissipation density across the film thickness:\n$$\n\\Phi_{A} = \\int_{0}^{h} \\phi(z) \\, dz = \\int_{0}^{h} \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right)^2 (z-h)^2 \\, dz\n$$\nSince $\\mu$ and $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ are constants, they can be taken out of the integral:\n$$\n\\Phi_{A} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right)^2 \\int_{0}^{h} (z-h)^2 \\, dz\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{h} (z-h)^2 \\, dz = \\left[ \\frac{(z-h)^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{h} = \\frac{(h-h)^3}{3} - \\frac{(0-h)^3}{3} = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{h^3}{3}\\right) = \\frac{h^3}{3}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back gives the final expression for the dissipation per unit area:\n$$\n\\Phi_{A} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{h^3}{3}\\right) = \\frac{h^3}{3\\mu} \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\right)^2\n$$\nThis expression provides the total rate of viscous energy dissipation per unit area of the substrate, given in terms of the fluid viscosity $\\mu$, film thickness $h$, and the applied pressure gradient $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$.

            "solution": "The starting point is the conservation of linear momentum for an incompressible fluid in steady state, which is given by $\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, where $\\rho$ is the density, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure, and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the deviatoric stress tensor.\n\nFor a steady, parallel flow between plates, the velocity field is $\\mathbf{v} = (u(y), 0, 0)$. The assumption of negligible inertia means the convective acceleration term $\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}$ is zero. The assumption of a negligible pressure gradient in the direction of flow implies $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = 0$. The momentum equation in the streamwise ($x$) direction simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\tau_{yx}}{dy} = 0\n$$\nThis equation implies that the shear stress, $\\tau_{yx}$, is constant across the fluid film thickness $h$. Let us denote this constant shear stress as $\\tau_w$.\n\nThe fluid is described by a power-law constitutive relation $\\eta(\\dot{\\gamma}) = K \\dot{\\gamma}^{n-1}$. The shear stress $\\tau_{yx}$ is related to the shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$ by $\\tau_{yx} = \\eta(\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma}$. For the given flow geometry, the scalar shear rate is $\\dot{\\gamma} = |\\frac{du}{dy}|$. Assuming the velocity increases monotonically from the stationary plate to the moving plate, we have $\\frac{du}{dy}  0$, so $\\dot{\\gamma} = \\frac{du}{dy}$.\nSubstituting the constitutive relation, the shear stress becomes:\n$$\n\\tau_{yx} = \\left(K \\left(\\frac{du}{dy}\\right)^{n-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{du}{dy}\\right) = K \\left(\\frac{du}{dy}\\right)^n\n$$\nSince $\\tau_{yx} = \\tau_w$ (constant), we have:\n$$\nK \\left(\\frac{du}{dy}\\right)^n = \\tau_w\n$$\nSolving for the velocity gradient gives:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = \\left(\\frac{\\tau_w}{K}\\right)^{1/n}\n$$\nThis shows that the shear rate $\\frac{du}{dy}$ is also constant across the gap.

Hence,\n$$\nW_{p}(t)=\\frac{\\tau_{p}^{2}(t)}{2\\,G}, \\qquad \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W_{p}}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\\frac{1}{G}\\,\\tau_{p}\\,\\dot{\\tau}_{p}.\n$$\nWith $G=\\eta_{p}/\\lambda$, we can rewrite the identity above as the polymer power balance\n$$\n\\tau_{p}\\,\\Gamma=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}W_{p}}{\\mathrm{d}t}+\\underbrace{\\frac{\\tau_{p}^{2}}{\\eta_{p}}}_{\\text{polymer dashpot dissipation}}.\n$$\nTherefore, the total viscous dissipation density is\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\mathrm{visc}}(t)=\\eta_{s}\\,\\Gamma^{2}+\\frac{\\tau_{p}^{2}(t)}{\\eta_{p}},\n$$\nand the elastic storage rate density is $\\dot{W}_{p}(t)=\\mathrm{d}W_{p}/\\mathrm{d}t$. The corresponding per-unit-area rates are obtained by multiplying by $H$, since the fields are uniform across the gap:\n$$\n\\Pi_{\\mathrm{visc}}(t)=H\\,\\Phi_{\\mathrm{visc}}(t), \\qquad \\dot{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\mathrm{el}}(t)=H\\,\\dot{W}_{p}(t).\n$$\n\nUsing $\\tau_{p}(t)=\\eta_{p}\\,\\Gamma\\left(1-\\exp\\left(-t/\\lambda\\right)\\right)$ gives explicit time dependence.
