It is scientifically grounded in the principles of polymer science, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objective in its formulation. The provided data, consisting of molar masses and corresponding mass fractions for a binned molecular weight distribution, are self-consistent, as the sum of mass fractions $\\sum_{i=1}^{8} w_i = 0.05 + 0.08 + 0.12 + 0.20 + 0.22 + 0.18 + 0.10 + 0.05 = 1.00$. The problem is a standard calculation in polymer characterization.\n\nWe are tasked with computing the number-average molecular weight ($M_n$), the weight-average molecular weight ($M_w$), and the polydispersity index ($\\mathrm{PDI}$) for the given polymer sample. The data is provided for $i = 1, \\dots, 8$ discrete bins, each with a representative molar mass $M_i$ and a corresponding mass fraction $w_i$.\n\nFirst, we establish the definitions for $M_n$ and $M_w$.\nThe number-average molecular weight, $M_n$, is defined as the total weight of all polymer molecules in a sample, divided by the total number of molecules. For a discrete distribution with $N_i$ molecules of molar mass $M_i$ in each bin $i$:\n$$M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i}{\\sum_i N_i}$$\nThe total mass of molecules in bin $i$ is $m_i = N_i M_i$. The total mass of the sample is $M_{total} = \\sum_i m_i$. The number of molecules $N_i$ can be expressed as $N_i = m_i / M_i$. Substituting this into the definition of $M_n$:\n$$M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i m_i}{\\sum_i \\frac{m_i}{M_i}}$$\nThe mass fraction $w_i$ is defined as $w_i = m_i / M_{total}$. We can divide the numerator and denominator by $M_{total}$:\n$$M_n = \\frac{\\frac{\\sum_i m_i}{M_{total}}}{\\frac{\\sum_i m_i/M_i}{M_{total}}} = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i}{\\sum_i \\frac{w_i}{M_i}}$$\nSince the mass fractions are normalized, $\\sum_i w_i = 1$. The formula for $M_n$ thus becomes:\n$$M_n = \\left( \\sum_i \\frac{w_i}{M_i} \\right)^{-1}$$\nUsing the provided data, we compute the term $\\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\frac{w_i}{M_i}$. All $M_i$ values are in units of $\\mathrm{kDa}$.\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\frac{w_i}{M_i} = \\frac{0.05}{50} + \\frac{0.08}{70} + \\frac{0.12}{90} + \\frac{0.20}{110} + \\frac{0.22}{130} + \\frac{0.18}{160} + \\frac{0.10}{200} + \\frac{0.05}{250}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\frac{w_i}{M_i} \\approx (0.001 + 0.00114286 + 0.00133333 + 0.00181818 + 0.00169231 + 0.001125 + 0.0005 + 0.0002) \\, \\mathrm{kDa}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\frac{w_i}{M_i} \\approx 0.00881168 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}^{-1}\n$$\nTherefore, $M_n$ is:\n$$M_n = \\frac{1}{0.00881168} \\, \\mathrm{kDa} \\approx 113.4852 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $M_n = 113.5 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}$.\n\nNext, we compute the weight-average molecular weight, $M_w$. It is defined as:\n$$M_w = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i^2}{\\sum_i N_i M_i}$$\nThis can be expressed in terms of mass, $m_i = N_i M_i$, as:\n$$M_w = \\frac{\\sum_i m_i M_i}{\\sum_i m_i}$$\nUsing the mass fraction $w_i = m_i / M_{total} = m_i / \\sum_i m_i$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$M_w = \\sum_i \\frac{m_i}{\\sum_k m_k} M_i = \\sum_i w_i M_i$$\nWe now substitute the given values:\n$$\nM_w = (0.05 \\times 50) + (0.08 \\times 70) + (0.12 \\times 90) + (0.20 \\times 110) + (0.22 \\times 130) + (0.18 \\times 160) + (0.10 \\times 200) + (0.05 \\times 250)\n$$\n$$\nM_w = 2.5 + 5.6 + 10.8 + 22.0 + 28.6 + 28.8 + 20.0 + 12.5 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}\n$$\n$$\nM_w = 130.8 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}\n$$\nThis value has four significant figures.\n\nThe polydispersity index, $\\mathrm{PDI}$, is the ratio of the weight-average molecular weight to the number-average molecular weight:\n$$\\mathrm{PDI} = \\frac{M_w}{M_n}$$\nUsing the unrounded values for accuracy:\n$$\\mathrm{PDI} = \\frac{130.8 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}}{113.4852 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}} \\approx 1.15257$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\mathrm{PDI} = 1.153$.\n\nFinally, we must decide if the sample can be treated as effectively monodisperse. The criterion given is $\\mathrm{PDI} \\leq 1.10$.\nOur calculated value is $\\mathrm{PDI} \\approx 1.153$.\nSince $1.153 > 1.10$, the condition is not met.

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed sound, well-posed, and scientifically grounded. It presents a standard problem in the statistical mechanics of soft matter.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we define the colloidal volume fraction $\\phi$. Second, we derive the osmotic pressure $\\Pi$ using the Carnahan-Starling equation of state.\n\n**a) Definition of Colloidal Volume Fraction $\\phi$**\n\nThe volume fraction, $\\phi$, of a suspension is defined as the fraction of the total volume of the system that is occupied by the suspended particles.\n\nLet the system have a total volume $V$ and contain $N$ colloidal particles. The number density of the colloids is given as $n$, which is defined as the number of particles per unit volume:\n$$n = \\frac{N}{V}$$\n\nThe colloidal particles are modeled as impenetrable hard spheres of radius $a$. The volume of a single spherical particle, $v_{p}$, is given by the standard formula for the volume of a sphere:\n$$v_{p} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3$$\n\nThe total volume occupied by all $N$ particles is the product of the number of particles and the volume of a single particle, $N v_{p}$.\n\nBy definition, the volume fraction $\\phi$ is the ratio of this total particle volume to the total system volume $V$:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{N v_{p}}{V}$$\n\nSubstituting the definition of number density, $n = N/V$, into this expression, we get:\n$$\\phi = \\left(\\frac{N}{V}\\right) v_{p} = n v_{p}$$\n\nFinally, substituting the expression for the single-particle volume $v_{p}$, we obtain the relationship between the volume fraction $\\phi$, the number density $n$, and the particle radius $a$:\n$$\\phi = n \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3\\right)$$\nThis equation explicitly defines the volume fraction in terms of the given parameters as requested. From this, we can also express the number density $n$ in terms of $\\phi$ and $a$, a relation that will be useful in the second part of the problem:\n$$n = \\frac{\\phi}{v_p} = \\frac{\\phi}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3} = \\frac{3\\phi}{4\\pi a^3}$$\n\n**b) Derivation of Osmotic Pressure $\\Pi(\\phi)$**\n\nThe osmotic pressure $\\Pi$ of the colloidal suspension arises from the thermal motion of the colloidal particles. Under the given assumptions, the solvent acts as a continuum thermal bath, and the osmotic pressure of the colloid subsystem is equivalent to the thermodynamic pressure $P$ of a one-component fluid composed of the colloidal particles. We can therefore use the statistical mechanical framework for a simple fluid to derive $\\Pi$.\n\nThe pressure of a fluid can be derived from its Helmholtz free energy, $F$. The total free energy is the sum of the ideal gas contribution, $F_{\\text{id}}$, and an excess contribution, $F_{\\text{ex}}$, which accounts for particle interactions:\n$$F(N, V, T) = F_{\\text{id}}(N, V, T) + F_{\\text{ex}}(N, V, T)$$\nThe pressure is given by the thermodynamic relation:\n$$\\Pi = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial V}\\right)_{N,T} = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{id}}}{\\partial V}\\right)_{N,T} - \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial V}\\right)_{N,T}$$\nThe ideal gas contribution to the pressure is $\\Pi_{\\text{id}} = n k_{B} T$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\nThe excess pressure, $\\Pi_{\\text{ex}}$, is related to the excess free energy. The excess free energy can be expressed as $F_{\\text{ex}} = N f^{\\text{ex}}$, where $f^{\\text{ex}}$ is the excess free energy per particle. The number density is $n=N/V$. Thus,\n$$\\Pi_{\\text{ex}} = - \\frac{\\partial (N f^{\\text{ex}}(n))}{\\partial V} = -N \\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial n} \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial V} = -N \\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial n} \\left(-\\frac{N}{V^2}\\right) = n^2 \\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial n}$$\nThe total osmotic pressure is therefore:\n$$\\Pi = n k_{B} T + n^2 \\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial n}$$\nThe excess free energy per particle, $f^{\\text{ex}}$, is related to the compressibility factor, $Z(\\phi)$, through thermodynamic integration:\n$$\\frac{f^{\\text{ex}}(\\phi)}{k_{B}T} = \\int_{0}^{\\phi} \\frac{Z(\\phi') - 1}{\\phi'} d\\phi'$$\nwhere we have expressed $f^{\\text{ex}}$ as a function of the volume fraction $\\phi$. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, differentiating this expression with respect to $\\phi$ yields:\n$$\\frac{1}{k_{B}T} \\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial \\phi} = \\frac{Z(\\phi) - 1}{\\phi}$$\nTo use this in our pressure equation, we apply the chain rule to the derivative with respect to $n$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial \\phi} \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial n}$$\nFrom part (a), we know $\\phi = n v_p$, so $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial n} = v_p$. Substituting this and the result from the integral, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial n} = \\left( k_{B}T \\frac{Z(\\phi) - 1}{\\phi} \\right) v_p$$\nNow we substitute this back into the expression for the total pressure $\\Pi$:\n$$\\Pi = n k_{B} T + n^2 \\left( k_{B}T \\frac{Z(\\phi) - 1}{\\phi} v_p \\right)$$\nUsing the relation $\\phi = n v_p$, we can simplify the second term:\n$$\\Pi = n k_{B} T + n (n v_p) k_{B} T \\frac{Z(\\phi) - 1}{\\phi} = n k_{B} T + n \\phi k_{B} T \\frac{Z(\\phi) - 1}{\\phi}$$\n$$\\Pi = n k_{B} T + n k_{B} T (Z(\\phi) - 1) = n k_{B} T Z(\\phi)$$\nThis rigorously establishes the direct relationship between the osmotic pressure $\\Pi$, the number density $n$, the temperature $T$, and the compressibility factor $Z(\\phi)$.\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the Carnahan-Starling equation of state for the compressibility factor of a hard-sphere fluid:\n$$Z(\\phi) = \\frac{1 + \\phi + \\phi^2 - \\phi^3}{(1 - \\phi)^3}$$\nTo obtain the final expression for $\\Pi$ as a function of $\\phi$, $k_B$, $T$, and $a$, we substitute the Carnahan-Starling expression for $Z(\\phi)$ and the expression for $n$ from part (a) into our derived pressure formula $\\Pi = n k_{B} T Z(\\phi)$:\n$$n = \\frac{3\\phi}{4\\pi a^3}$$\nSubstituting these gives:\n$$\\Pi(\\phi) = \\left( \\frac{3\\phi}{4\\pi a^3} \\right) k_{B} T \\left( \\frac{1 + \\phi + \\phi^2 - \\phi^3}{(1 - \\phi)^3} \\right)$$\nThis is the final, explicit analytic expression for the osmotic pressure of the colloidal suspension as a function of the specified variables.

We may therefore proceed with a full derivation.\n\nThe objective is to determine the dynamical regime of a flexible polymer in a good solvent by comparing the experimentally determined scaling of the diffusion coefficient with theoretical predictions for the free-draining and non-draining limits.\n\n**1) Derivation of Asymptotic Scaling Laws**\n\nThe analysis begins with the Stokes–Einstein relation for the self-diffusion coefficient $D$ of a particle in a fluid at temperature $T$:\n$$D = \\frac{k_{B}T}{\\zeta}$$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\\zeta$ is the translational friction coefficient. The temperature $T$ and the Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$ are constants for this analysis, so the scaling of $D$ with the polymer chain length $N$ is determined entirely by the scaling of $\\zeta$ with $N$.\n$$D(N) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\zeta(N)}$$\n\nWe consider the two limiting cases provided.\n\n**Free-draining limit (Rouse picture):**\nIn this limit, the solvent flows freely through the polymer coil, and the total friction is the sum of the frictional forces acting on each monomer. If $\\zeta_{0}$ is the friction coefficient of a single monomer, then the total friction coefficient $\\zeta$ is proportional to the number of monomers $N$:\n$$\\zeta \\propto N$$\nSubstituting this scaling into the expression for the diffusion coefficient gives:\n$$D(N) \\propto \\frac{1}{N} = N^{-1}$$\nThus, in the free-draining limit, the diffusion coefficient scales as $N^{-1}$.\n\n**Non-draining limit (Zimm picture):**\nIn this limit, long-range hydrodynamic interactions are dominant. The solvent is effectively trapped within the polymer coil and moves with it. The polymer coil thus behaves as a single impermeable sphere with an effective hydrodynamic radius $R_{H}$. The friction coefficient $\\zeta$ is given by the Stokes law for a sphere, which states that friction is proportional to the solvent viscosity $\\eta$ and the hydrodynamic radius $R_{H}$:\n$$\\zeta \\propto \\eta R_{H}$$\nThe problem states that the solvent viscosity $\\eta$ is constant. The hydrodynamic radius $R_{H}$ is assumed to be proportional to the overall size of the polymer coil, which, for a polymer in a good solvent, scales with the chain length $N$ according to Flory theory:\n$$R_{H} \\propto N^{\\nu}$$\nwhere $\\nu$ is the Flory exponent, given as $\\nu \\approx 0.588$.\nCombining these relations, the friction coefficient in the non-draining limit scales as:\n$$\\zeta \\propto N^{\\nu}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the diffusion coefficient yields:\n$$D(N) \\propto \\frac{1}{N^{\\nu}} = N^{-\\nu}$$\nThus, in the non-draining limit, the diffusion coefficient scales as $N^{-\\nu}$.\n\n**2) Calculation of the Experimental Scaling Exponent $\\alpha$**\n\nWe assume the diffusion coefficient follows a power-law relationship with the chain length $N$:\n$$D(N) = A N^{-\\alpha}$$\nwhere $A$ is a prefactor independent of $N$ and $\\alpha$ is the scaling exponent we wish to determine.
