            "problem": "A synthetic linear polymer melt is categorized within complex fluids by its molecular weight distribution, which critically informs computational modeling of its linear viscoelastic response. A gel permeation chromatography (GPC) experiment yields a chromatogram binned by elution volume into molecular-weight bins with representative molar masses $M_i$ and normalized mass fractions $w_i$, after calibration and correction for detector sensitivity and baseline. The polymer under study is a narrowly distributed polystyrene sample intended for small-amplitude oscillatory shear modeling under the assumption of an effectively monodisperse input if warranted by its polydispersity. The binned data are:\n- Bin $1$: $M_1 = 50\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$, $w_1 = 0.05$\n- Bin $2$: $M_2 = 70\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$, $w_2 = 0.08$\n- Bin $3$: $M_3 = 90\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$, $w_3 = 0.12$\n- Bin $4$: $M_4 = 110\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$, $w_4 = 0.20$\n- Bin $5$: $M_5 = 130\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$, $w_5 = 0.22$\n- Bin $6$: $M_6 = 160\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$, $w_6 = 0.18$\n- Bin $7$: $M_7 = 200\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$, $w_7 = 0.10$\n- Bin $8$: $M_8 = 250\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$, $w_8 = 0.05$\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of number-average molecular weight $M_n$ and weight-average molecular weight $M_w$, and the relationship between mass fraction and number fraction, compute $M_n$, $M_w$, and the polydispersity index $\\mathrm{PDI}$ for the sample.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of polymer science, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objective in its formulation. The provided data, consisting of molar masses and corresponding mass fractions for a binned molecular weight distribution, are self-consistent, as the sum of mass fractions $\\sum_{i=1}^{8} w_i = 0.05 + 0.08 + 0.12 + 0.20 + 0.22 + 0.18 + 0.10 + 0.05 = 1.00$. The problem is a standard calculation in polymer characterization.\n\nWe are tasked with computing the number-average molecular weight ($M_n$), the weight-average molecular weight ($M_w$), and the polydispersity index ($\\mathrm{PDI}$) for the given polymer sample. The data is provided for $i = 1, \\dots, 8$ discrete bins, each with a representative molar mass $M_i$ and a corresponding mass fraction $w_i$.\n\nFirst, we establish the definitions for $M_n$ and $M_w$.\nThe number-average molecular weight, $M_n$, is defined as the total weight of all polymer molecules in a sample, divided by the total number of molecules. For a discrete distribution with $N_i$ molecules of molar mass $M_i$ in each bin $i$:\n$$M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i}{\\sum_i N_i}$$\nThe total mass of molecules in bin $i$ is $m_i = N_i M_i$. The total mass of the sample is $M_{total} = \\sum_i m_i$. The number of molecules $N_i$ can be expressed as $N_i = m_i / M_i$. Substituting this into the definition of $M_n$:\n$$M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i m_i}{\\sum_i \\frac{m_i}{M_i}}$$\nThe mass fraction $w_i$ is defined as $w_i = m_i / M_{total}$. We can divide the numerator and denominator by $M_{total}$:\n$$M_n = \\frac{\\frac{\\sum_i m_i}{M_{total}}}{\\frac{\\sum_i m_i/M_i}{M_{total}}} = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i}{\\sum_i \\frac{w_i}{M_i}}$$\nSince the mass fractions are normalized, $\\sum_i w_i = 1$. The formula for $M_n$ thus becomes:\n$$M_n = \\left( \\sum_i \\frac{w_i}{M_i} \\right)^{-1}$$\nUsing the provided data, we compute the term $\\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\frac{w_i}{M_i}$. All $M_i$ values are in units of $\\mathrm{kDa}$.\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\frac{w_i}{M_i} = \\frac{0.05}{50} + \\frac{0.08}{70} + \\frac{0.12}{90} + \\frac{0.20}{110} + \\frac{0.22}{130} + \\frac{0.18}{160} + \\frac{0.10}{200} + \\frac{0.05}{250}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\frac{w_i}{M_i} \\approx (0.001 + 0.00114286 + 0.00133333 + 0.00181818 + 0.00169231 + 0.001125 + 0.0005 + 0.0002) \\, \\mathrm{kDa}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\frac{w_i}{M_i} \\approx 0.00881168 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}^{-1}\n$$\nTherefore, $M_n$ is:\n$$M_n = \\frac{1}{0.00881168} \\, \\mathrm{kDa} \\approx 113.4852 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $M_n = 113.5 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}$.\n\nNext, we compute the weight-average molecular weight, $M_w$. It is defined as:\n$$M_w = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i^2}{\\sum_i N_i M_i}$$\nThis can be expressed in terms of mass, $m_i = N_i M_i$, as:\n$$M_w = \\frac{\\sum_i m_i M_i}{\\sum_i m_i}$$\nUsing the mass fraction $w_i = m_i / M_{total} = m_i / \\sum_i m_i$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$M_w = \\sum_i \\frac{m_i}{\\sum_k m_k} M_i = \\sum_i w_i M_i$$\nWe now substitute the given values:\n$$\nM_w = (0.05 \\times 50) + (0.08 \\times 70) + (0.12 \\times 90) + (0.20 \\times 110) + (0.22 \\times 130) + (0.18 \\times 160) + (0.10 \\times 200) + (0.05 \\times 250)\n$$\n$$\nM_w = 2.5 + 5.6 + 10.8 + 22.0 + 28.6 + 28.8 + 20.0 + 12.5 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}\n$$\n$$\nM_w = 130.8 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}\n$$\nThis value has four significant figures.\n\nThe polydispersity index, $\\mathrm{PDI}$, is the ratio of the weight-average molecular weight to the number-average molecular weight:\n$$\\mathrm{PDI} = \\frac{M_w}{M_n}$$\nUsing the unrounded values for accuracy:\n$$\\mathrm{PDI} = \\frac{130.8 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}}{113.4852 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}} \\approx 1.15257$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\mathrm{PDI} = 1.153$.\n\nFinally, we must decide if the sample can be treated as effectively monodisperse. The criterion given is $\\mathrm{PDI} \\leq 1.10$.\nOur calculated value is $\\mathrm{PDI} \\approx 1.153$.\nSince $1.153 > 1.10$, the condition is not met. Therefore, the sample is not effectively monodisperse for the intended modeling application. The decision is encoded as $0$.\n\nThe four required quantities are:\n$M_n = 113.5 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}$\n$M_w = 130.8 \\, \\mathrm{kDa}$\n$\\mathrm{PDI} = 1.153$\nDecision $= 0$",

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed sound, well-posed, and scientifically grounded. It presents a standard problem in the statistical mechanics of soft matter.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we define the colloidal volume fraction $\\phi$. Second, we derive the osmotic pressure $\\Pi$ using the Carnahan-Starling equation of state.\n\n**a) Definition of Colloidal Volume Fraction $\\phi$**\n\nThe volume fraction, $\\phi$, of a suspension is defined as the fraction of the total volume of the system that is occupied by the suspended particles.\n\nLet the system have a total volume $V$ and contain $N$ colloidal particles. The number density of the colloids is given as $n$, which is defined as the number of particles per unit volume:\n$$n = \\frac{N}{V}$$\n\nThe colloidal particles are modeled as impenetrable hard spheres of radius $a$. The volume of a single spherical particle, $v_{p}$, is given by the standard formula for the volume of a sphere:\n$$v_{p} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3$$\n\nThe total volume occupied by all $N$ particles is the product of the number of particles and the volume of a single particle, $N v_{p}$.\n\nBy definition, the volume fraction $\\phi$ is the ratio of this total particle volume to the total system volume $V$:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{N v_{p}}{V}$$\n\nSubstituting the definition of number density, $n = N/V$, into this expression, we get:\n$$\\phi = \\left(\\frac{N}{V}\\right) v_{p} = n v_{p}$$\n\nFinally, substituting the expression for the single-particle volume $v_{p}$, we obtain the relationship between the volume fraction $\\phi$, the number density $n$, and the particle radius $a$:\n$$\\phi = n \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3\\right)$$\nThis equation explicitly defines the volume fraction in terms of the given parameters as requested. From this, we can also express the number density $n$ in terms of $\\phi$ and $a$, a relation that will be useful in the second part of the problem:\n$$n = \\frac{\\phi}{v_p} = \\frac{\\phi}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3} = \\frac{3\\phi}{4\\pi a^3}$$\n\n**b) Derivation of Osmotic Pressure $\\Pi(\\phi)$**\n\nThe osmotic pressure $\\Pi$ of the colloidal suspension arises from the thermal motion of the colloidal particles. Under the given assumptions, the solvent acts as a continuum thermal bath, and the osmotic pressure of the colloid subsystem is equivalent to the thermodynamic pressure $P$ of a one-component fluid composed of the colloidal particles. We can therefore use the statistical mechanical framework for a simple fluid to derive $\\Pi$.\n\nThe pressure of a fluid can be derived from its Helmholtz free energy, $F$. The total free energy is the sum of the ideal gas contribution, $F_{\\text{id}}$, and an excess contribution, $F_{\\text{ex}}$, which accounts for particle interactions:\n$$F(N, V, T) = F_{\\text{id}}(N, V, T) + F_{\\text{ex}}(N, V, T)$$\nThe pressure is given by the thermodynamic relation:\n$$\\Pi = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial V}\\right)_{N,T} = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{id}}}{\\partial V}\\right)_{N,T} - \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial V}\\right)_{N,T}$$\nThe ideal gas contribution to the pressure is $\\Pi_{\\text{id}} = n k_{B} T$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\nThe excess pressure, $\\Pi_{\\text{ex}}$, is related to the excess free energy. The excess free energy can be expressed as $F_{\\text{ex}} = N f^{\\text{ex}}$, where $f^{\\text{ex}}$ is the excess free energy per particle. The number density is $n=N/V$. Thus,\n$$\\Pi_{\\text{ex}} = - \\frac{\\partial (N f^{\\text{ex}}(n))}{\\partial V} = -N \\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial n} \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial V} = -N \\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial n} \\left(-\\frac{N}{V^2}\\right) = n^2 \\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial n}$$\nThe total osmotic pressure is therefore:\n$$\\Pi = n k_{B} T + n^2 \\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial n}$$\nThe excess free energy per particle, $f^{\\text{ex}}$, is related to the compressibility factor, $Z(\\phi)$, through thermodynamic integration:\n$$\\frac{f^{\\text{ex}}(\\phi)}{k_{B}T} = \\int_{0}^{\\phi} \\frac{Z(\\phi') - 1}{\\phi'} d\\phi'$$\nwhere we have expressed $f^{\\text{ex}}$ as a function of the volume fraction $\\phi$. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, differentiating this expression with respect to $\\phi$ yields:\n$$\\frac{1}{k_{B}T} \\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial \\phi} = \\frac{Z(\\phi) - 1}{\\phi}$$\nTo use this in our pressure equation, we apply the chain rule to the derivative with respect to $n$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial \\phi} \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial n}$$\nFrom part (a), we know $\\phi = n v_p$, so $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial n} = v_p$. Substituting this and the result from the integral, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f^{\\text{ex}}}{\\partial n} = \\left( k_{B}T \\frac{Z(\\phi) - 1}{\\phi} \\right) v_p$$\nNow we substitute this back into the expression for the total pressure $\\Pi$:\n$$\\Pi = n k_{B} T + n^2 \\left( k_{B}T \\frac{Z(\\phi) - 1}{\\phi} v_p \\right)$$\nUsing the relation $\\phi = n v_p$, we can simplify the second term:\n$$\\Pi = n k_{B} T + n (n v_p) k_{B} T \\frac{Z(\\phi) - 1}{\\phi} = n k_{B} T + n \\phi k_{B} T \\frac{Z(\\phi) - 1}{\\phi}$$\n$$\\Pi = n k_{B} T + n k_{B} T (Z(\\phi) - 1) = n k_{B} T Z(\\phi)$$\nThis rigorously establishes the direct relationship between the osmotic pressure $\\Pi$, the number density $n$, the temperature $T$, and the compressibility factor $Z(\\phi)$.\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the Carnahan-Starling equation of state for the compressibility factor of a hard-sphere fluid:\n$$Z(\\phi) = \\frac{1 + \\phi + \\phi^2 - \\phi^3}{(1 - \\phi)^3}$$\nTo obtain the final expression for $\\Pi$ as a function of $\\phi$, $k_B$, $T$, and $a$, we substitute the Carnahan-Starling expression for $Z(\\phi)$ and the expression for $n$ from part (a) into our derived pressure formula $\\Pi = n k_{B} T Z(\\phi)$:\n$$n = \\frac{3\\phi}{4\\pi a^3}$$\nSubstituting these gives:\n$$\\Pi(\\phi) = \\left( \\frac{3\\phi}{4\\pi a^3} \\right) k_{B} T \\left( \\frac{1 + \\phi + \\phi^2 - \\phi^3}{(1 - \\phi)^3} \\right)$$\nThis is the final, explicit analytic expression for the osmotic pressure of the colloidal suspension as a function of the specified variables.

The motion of the colloidal probe is governed by the Langevin equation, which is an expression of Newton's second law for a particle subject to dissipative and random forces from a surrounding fluid:\n$$\nm \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}(t)}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{drag}}(t) + \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{thermal}}(t)\n$$\nHere, $m$ is the mass of the probe, $\\mathbf{v}(t)$ is its velocity, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{drag}}(t)$ is the hydrodynamic drag force, and $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{thermal}}(t)$ is the stochastic force arising from thermal fluctuations in the fluid.\n\nThe problem specifies that the probe is neutrally buoyant, so its density is the same as the fluid's density, $\\rho = 1000\\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m^{-3}}$. The probe's mass is $m = \\rho V = \\rho \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3$, where $a=500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is the probe radius.\nThe problem also states that on long timescales, the fluid is Newtonian with viscosity $\\eta = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$.

It is instructive to first calculate the momentum relaxation time of the probe, $\\tau_p = m/\\gamma$.\nThe mass is $m = (1000\\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m^{-3}}) \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (500 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3 \\approx 5.236 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe drag coefficient is $\\gamma = 6\\pi(0.15\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s})(500 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\approx 1.414 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot s^{-1}}$.\nThe momentum relaxation time is thus $\\tau_p = \\frac{5.236 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{kg}}{1.414 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot s^{-1}}} \\approx 3.7 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nSince the time of interest $t=100\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is vastly greater than $\\tau_p$, we are deep in the overdamped regime where the inertial term $m \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}(t)}{dt}$ is negligible compared to the drag and thermal forces.

The simple Langevin equation used above assumes an instantaneous response of the fluid, which is only valid at long times. For a complex fluid containing polymers and surfactants, the response is time-dependent, or viscoelastic. This is described by the Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE):\n$$\nm \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}(t)}{dt} = -\\int_{-\\infty}^t \\Gamma(t-t') \\mathbf{v}(t') dt' + \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{thermal}}(t)\n$$\nHere, the constant drag coefficient $\\gamma$ is replaced by a memory kernel $\\Gamma(t)$, which represents the time-delayed frictional force. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is also generalized: $\\langle F_{\\text{thermal},i}(t)F_{\\text{thermal},j}(t') \\rangle = k_B T \\Gamma(|t-t'|) \\delta_{ij}$.\n\nThe memory effects arise from the finite time required for the fluid's microstructures to relax after being disturbed by the probe's motion.\n- **Polymers and Surfactants**: The fluid is composed of flexible polymer coils and surfactant micelles. When the probe moves, it deforms this local environment. The polymer chains are stretched or compressed, and micelles might be distorted or broken. These structures do not relax instantaneously; their reconfiguration is governed by a spectrum of relaxation times. This stored elastic stress exerts a force on the probe that depends on its past trajectory, giving rise to viscoelastic memory.\n- **Hydrodynamic Memory**: Even in a simple fluid, a moving probe generates a velocity field (vorticity) that diffuses away on a timescale $\\tau_v = a^2\\rho/\\eta \\approx (5\\times 10^{-7})^2 \\times 1000 / 0.15 \\approx 1.7\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$. Before this time, the probe interacts with its own wake, another source of memory.\n\nThe short-time dynamics of the MSD can be divided into distinct regimes:\n1.  **Ballistic Regime ($t \\ll \\tau_p \\sim 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{s}$)**: At extremely short times, before the probe has experienced significant interactions with the fluid, it moves inertially. Its velocity is determined by thermal energy, $\\langle v^2 \\rangle = 3k_B T/m$. The MSD scales quadratically with time: $\\langle |\\Delta\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle \\propto t^2$.\n2.  **Sub-diffusive Regime ($\\tau_p \\ll t \\lesssim \\tau_{micro}$)**: After the initial ballistic flight, but on timescales comparable to or shorter than the relaxation times of the polymers and micelles ($\\tau_{micro}$), the fluid's elastic nature dominates. The probe is effectively trapped in a transient \"cage\" formed by the surrounding microstructure. Its motion is strongly hindered, leading to sub-diffusion. In this regime, the MSD scales as a power law with an exponent less than one: $\\langle |\\Delta\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle \\propto t^\\alpha$, where $\\alpha  1$. The specific value of $\\alpha$ (e.g., $1/2$, $3/4$) depends on the detailed physics of the polymer/surfactant dynamics (e.g., Zimm or Rouse model) and the extent of hydrodynamic interactions. This sub-diffusive behavior is the key signature of viscoelasticity in passive microrheology.\n3.  **Diffusive Regime ($t \\gg \\tau_{micro}, \\tau_v$)**: At very long times, much greater than all relevant fluid relaxation times, the memory effects have decayed. The probe has moved over distances large compared to the microstructural features. The fluid's complex response averages out, and it behaves as a simple Newtonian liquid with an effective zero-frequency viscosity $\\eta$. This leads to the normal diffusive behavior, $\\langle |\\Delta\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle \\propto t$, as calculated in the first part.\n\nIn summary, prior to the long-time diffusive regime, the leading-time scaling forms are the ballistic $t^2$ dependence at infinitesimal times, followed by a characteristic sub-diffusive $t^\\alpha$ ($\\alpha  1$) scaling originating from the viscoelastic memory of the polymer and surfactant constituents.",
