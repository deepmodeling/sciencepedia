            "introduction": "The Lennard-Jones potential provides a rich description of non-bonded interactions, but its full form can be complex. Near the equilibrium separation, however, its behavior simplifies dramatically. This exercise  guides you through a Taylor expansion of the potential to show that for small displacements, the interaction mimics a simple harmonic spring, a foundational concept in modeling molecular vibrations and lattice dynamics. By calculating the effective spring constant, you will directly link the microscopic parameters $\\epsilon$ and $\\sigma$ to a key mechanical property of the interacting pair.",

In molecular simulations, calculating interactions over infinite distances is impossible, necessitating a cutoff, but a naive truncation introduces unphysical forces. This exercise  demonstrates the standard \"force-shifting\" technique, a vital tool that ensures both the potential and the force smoothly go to zero at the cutoff distance, preventing simulation artifacts. Understanding this procedure is essential for developing stable and accurate simulation codes.",

            "problem": "In simulations of computational complex fluids with non-bonded interactions, a common practice is to truncate pair potentials at a finite cutoff distance $r_c$ to limit computational cost. However, a naive truncation of a central pair potential $u(r)$ at $r_c$ generally introduces a discontinuity in both the potential and its derivative, which leads to non-physical forces and artifacts. To mitigate this, one constructs a modified, truncated, force-shifted potential $u_{fs}(r)$ such that both the potential and its derivative vanish at the cutoff while preserving short-range behavior.\n\nStarting from the following foundations: (i) the force associated with a central pair potential is $F(r)=-\\frac{d}{dr}u(r)$, (ii) the Lennard–Jones (LJ) potential, defined here for two spherical particles with energy scale $\\varepsilon$ and length scale $\\sigma$, is $u(r)=4\\varepsilon\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12}-\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6}\\right]$, and (iii) the truncated potential is required to satisfy $u_{fs}(r_c)=0$ and $\\frac{d}{dr}u_{fs}(r)\\big|_{r=r_c}=0$, derive a minimal modification $u_{fs}(r)$ for $rr_c$ by adding to $u(r)$ the lowest-order polynomial in $(r-r_c)$ that enforces these two boundary conditions while leaving the underlying $u(r)$ otherwise unchanged. Then, using your derived $u_{fs}(r)$, compute the corresponding modified force $F_{fs}(r)$ for the Lennard–Jones potential, and represent your result as a single closed-form analytic expression that enforces $F_{fs}(r)=0$ for $r\\ge r_c$ by using the Heaviside step function $H(x)$, defined as $H(x)=1$ for $x0$ and $H(x)=0$ for $x0$. You may treat $H(0)$ as not required.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single analytic expression in terms of $\\varepsilon$, $\\sigma$, $r$, and $r_c$, using $H(r_c-r)$ to encode the truncation.

            "solution": "The objective is to derive the expression for the force-shifted Lennard-Jones force, $F_{fs}(r)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the general form of the modified potential, $u_{fs}(r)$. For $r  r_c$, it is defined by adding a correctional polynomial, $p(r)$, to the original potential $u(r)$:\n$$u_{fs}(r) = u(r) + p(r)$$\nThe problem specifies that $p(r)$ should be the lowest-order polynomial in $(r-r_c)$ that satisfies the boundary conditions. To satisfy two conditions, we need a polynomial with at least two free parameters. A constant polynomial has one parameter, while a linear polynomial has two. Thus, the lowest-order polynomial required is linear in $(r-r_c)$:\n$$p(r) = A + B(r-r_c)$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined.\n\nWe apply the two boundary conditions at $r=r_c$:\n$1$. $u_{fs}(r_c) = 0$:\n$$u(r_c) + p(r_c) = 0$$\nAt $r=r_c$, $p(r_c)= A + B(r_c - r_c) = A$.

Thus,\n$$B = -\\frac{d}{dr}u(r)\\bigg|_{r=r_c}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $A$ and $B$ back into $p(r)$, we find the correctional polynomial:\n$$p(r) = -u(r_c) - (r-r_c)\\frac{d}{dr}u(r)\\bigg|_{r=r_c}$$\nThe modified potential for $rr_c$ becomes:\n$$u_{fs}(r) = u(r) - u(r_c) - (r-r_c)\\frac{d}{dr}u(r)\\bigg|_{r=r_c}$$\n\nNext, we derive the modified force $F_{fs}(r) = -\\frac{d}{dr}u_{fs}(r)$.
