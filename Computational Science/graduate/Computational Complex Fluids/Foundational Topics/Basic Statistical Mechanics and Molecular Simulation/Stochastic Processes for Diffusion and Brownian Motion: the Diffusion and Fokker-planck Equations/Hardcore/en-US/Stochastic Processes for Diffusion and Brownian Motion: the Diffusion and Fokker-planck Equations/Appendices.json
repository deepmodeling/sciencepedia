The task is a standard, albeit non-trivial, derivation and application within the field of computational complex fluids and statistical mechanics.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation of the required quantities. The system is defined in dimensionless units where the particle mass $m=1$ and the thermal energy $k_B T=1$. The damping rate is $\\gamma$.\n\n### 1. Mean-Squared Displacement (MSD) for the Overdamped Model\n\nThe overdamped Langevin equation is given by\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x(t)=\\sqrt{2D}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nwhere $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process and the diffusion coefficient is $D = 1/\\gamma$ as per the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in the specified units.

Substituting this into the expression, we get:\n$$\n\\langle [\\Delta x(t)]^2 \\rangle_{\\text{overdamped}} = 2Dt\n$$\nUsing the given relation $D = 1/\\gamma$, the final expression for the overdamped MSD is:\n$$\n\\langle [\\Delta x(t)]^2 \\rangle_{\\text{overdamped}} = \\frac{2t}{\\gamma}\n$$\n\n### 2. Mean-Squared Displacement (MSD) for the Underdamped Model\n\nThe underdamped Langevin model for a free particle is described by the coupled SDEs:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x(t)=v(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t,\\qquad \\mathrm{d}v(t)=-\\gamma\\,v(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t+\\sqrt{2\\gamma}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nThe equation for velocity $v(t)$ is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The problem states that the initial velocity $v(0)$ is sampled from its stationary distribution. For this process, the stationary distribution is a Gaussian with mean $\\langle v \\rangle = 0$ and variance $\\langle v^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T}{m} = 1$. The velocity process is therefore stationary.\n\nThe time-autocorrelation function for a stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is given by:\n$$\n\\langle v(s) v(u) \\rangle = \\langle v^2 \\rangle_{\\text{stationary}} e^{-\\gamma |s-u|} = e^{-\\gamma |s-u|}\n$$\nThe displacement is found by integrating the velocity: $\\Delta x(t) = x(t) - x(0) = \\int_0^t v(s) \\, \\mathrm{d}s$.\n\nTo find the MSD, we compute the expectation of the square of this integral:\n$$\n\\langle [\\Delta x(t)]^2 \\rangle_{\\text{underdamped}} = \\left\\langle \\left( \\int_0^t v(s) \\, \\mathrm{d}s \\right)^2 \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}s \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}u \\, v(s)v(u) \\right\\rangle\n$$\nBy linearity of expectation, we can move the averaging inside the integral:\n$$\n\\langle [\\Delta x(t)]^2 \\rangle_{\\text{underdamped}} = \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}s \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}u \\, \\langle v(s)v(u) \\rangle = \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}s \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}u \\, e^{-\\gamma |s-u|}\n$$\nWe can evaluate this double integral by splitting the domain of integration and using symmetry:\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}s \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}u \\, e^{-\\gamma |s-u|} = 2 \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}s \\int_0^s \\mathrm{d}u \\, e^{-\\gamma (s-u)}\n$$\nWe evaluate the inner integral with respect to $u$:\n$$\n\\int_0^s e^{-\\gamma s} e^{\\gamma u} \\, \\mathrm{d}u = e^{-\\gamma s} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\gamma} e^{\\gamma u} \\right]_0^s = e^{-\\gamma s} \\frac{1}{\\gamma} (e^{\\gamma s} - 1) = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} (1 - e^{-\\gamma s})\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the outer integral with respect to $s$:\n$$\n2 \\int_0^t \\frac{1}{\\gamma} (1 - e^{-\\gamma s}) \\, \\mathrm{d}s = \\frac{2}{\\gamma} \\left[ s + \\frac{1}{\\gamma} e^{-\\gamma s} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{2}{\\gamma} \\left( \\left( t + \\frac{1}{\\gamma} e^{-\\gamma t} \\right) - \\left( 0 + \\frac{1}{\\gamma} e^{-\\gamma \\cdot 0} \\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{2}{\\gamma} \\left( t + \\frac{e^{-\\gamma t}}{\\gamma} - \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\right) = \\frac{2t}{\\gamma} - \\frac{2}{\\gamma^2} (1 - e^{-\\gamma t})\n$$\nThus, the MSD for the underdamped model is:\n$$\n\\langle [\\Delta x(t)]^2 \\rangle_{\\text{underdamped}} = \\frac{2t}{\\gamma} - \\frac{2}{\\gamma^2}(1 - e^{-\\gamma t})\n$$\nThis result correctly captures the ballistic regime $\\langle [\\Delta x(t)]^2 \\rangle \\approx t^2$ for $t \\ll 1/\\gamma$ and the diffusive regime $\\langle [\\Delta x(t)]^2 \\rangle \\approx 2Dt$ for $t \\gg 1/\\gamma$.\n\n### 3. MSD Deviation $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MSD}}(\\gamma, t)$\n\nThe deviation is defined as the difference between the underdamped and overdamped MSDs:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MSD}}(\\gamma,t) = \\langle [x(t)-x(0)]^2 \\rangle_{\\text{underdamped}} - \\langle [x(t)-x(0)]^2 \\rangle_{\\text{overdamped}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MSD}}(\\gamma,t) = \\left( \\frac{2t}{\\gamma} - \\frac{2}{\\gamma^2}(1 - e^{-\\gamma t}) \\right) - \\left( \\frac{2t}{\\gamma} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MSD}}(\\gamma,t) = - \\frac{2}{\\gamma^2}(1 - e^{-\\gamma t})\n$$\n\n### 4. Non-Gaussian Parameter $\\alpha_2(t)$\n\nThe non-Gaussian parameter is defined as:\n$$\n\\alpha_2(t) \\equiv \\frac{\\langle [\\Delta x(t)]^4\\rangle}{3\\langle [\\Delta x(t)]^2\\rangle^2}-1\n$$\nTo evaluate this, we must determine the probability distribution of the displacement $\\Delta x(t)$. The velocity $v(t)$ is governed by a linear SDE driven by a Gaussian white noise process $\\mathrm{d}W_t$. The solution to this SDE is a linear functional of the noise history and the initial condition. As the initial velocity $v(0)$ is drawn from a Gaussian distribution, and the driving noise is Gaussian, the entire stochastic process $\\{v(t)\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a Gaussian process.\n\nThe displacement $\\Delta x(t) = \\int_0^t v(s) \\mathrm{d}s$ is a linear operation (integration) on the Gaussian process $v(s)$. A fundamental property of Gaussian processes is that they are closed under linear transformations. Therefore, for any fixed time $t$, the random variable $\\Delta x(t)$ must have a Gaussian probability distribution.\n\nThe mean of the displacement is $\\langle \\Delta x(t) \\rangle = \\int_0^t \\langle v(s) \\rangle \\mathrm{d}s$. Since the velocity process is stationary with $\\langle v \\rangle = 0$, we have $\\langle \\Delta x(t) \\rangle = 0$.\n\nFor any zero-mean Gaussian random variable $Z$, all higher-order moments are determined by the second moment (variance), $\\sigma^2 = \\langle Z^2 \\rangle$. Specifically, the fourth moment is given by Wick's theorem:\n$$\n\\langle Z^4 \\rangle = 3(\\langle Z^2 \\rangle)^2\n$$\nIn our case, $Z = \\Delta x(t)$. Substituting this property into the definition of $\\alpha_2(t)$:\n$$\n\\alpha_2(t) = \\frac{3(\\langle [\\Delta x(t)]^2 \\rangle)^2}{3\\langle [\\Delta x(t)]^2\\rangle^2}-1 = 1-1 = 0\n$$\nTherefore, for the free Brownian particle under the underdamped Langevin dynamics, the non-Gaussian parameter $\\alpha_2(t)$ is identically zero for all $t > 0$.\n\nThe parameter $\\alpha_2(t)$ would deviate from zero only if the displacement $\\Delta x(t)$ were not a Gaussian-distributed random variable. This would occur if the underlying assumptions were violated, for example:\n1.  If a non-linear external force field $F(x)$ were applied, the SDE for velocity would depend on $x$, making the system of equations for $(x,v)$ non-linear. The resulting process for $\\Delta x(t)$ would no longer be Gaussian.\n2.  If the stochastic force term were not Gaussian (e.g., arising from a Poisson or other Lévy process).\n3.  If the damping term $\\gamma$ were dependent on position or velocity.\n\nUnder the strict conditions of a free particle governed by the linear Langevin equation with Gaussian noise, the displacement statistics are perfectly Gaussian, and thus $\\alpha_2(t) = 0$.\n\n### Summary of Formulas for Implementation\n- MSD Deviation: $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{MSD}}(\\gamma,t) = - \\frac{2}{\\gamma^2}(1 - e^{-\\gamma t})$\n- Non-Gaussian Parameter: $\\alpha_2(t) = 0$",

This is a fundamental and factually sound model in statistical physics and stochastic calculus. The SDE and its numerical approximation via the Euler-Maruyama method are standard in the field. All premises are correct.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: The problem is posed in precise mathematical language and is directly relevant to the topic of stochastic processes, diffusion, and their numerical approximation.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is self-contained.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three stages as required: first, we find the exact second moment for the continuous process; second, we find the second moment for the discrete EM scheme; third, we compare them asymptotically to find the leading-order weak error.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Exact Second Moment $\\mathbb{E}[X_T^2]$**\n\nWe begin with the SDE for $X_t$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X_t = -\\lambda X_t \\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{2D} \\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nTo find an equation for the evolution of the second moment, $\\mathbb{E}[X_t^2]$, we apply Itô's lemma to the function $f(x) = x^2$. For a general Itô process $\\mathrm{d}Y_t = a(Y_t,t)\\mathrm{d}t + b(Y_t,t)\\mathrm{d}W_t$, Itô's lemma states that $\\mathrm{d}f(Y_t) = [a(Y_t,t)f'(Y_t) + \\frac{1}{2}b(Y_t,t)^2 f''(Y_t)]\\mathrm{d}t + b(Y_t,t)f'(Y_t)\\mathrm{d}W_t$.\nIn our case, $Y_t = X_t$, $a(X_t,t) = -\\lambda X_t$, $b(X_t,t) = \\sqrt{2D}$. The derivatives of $f(x)=x^2$ are $f'(x)=2x$ and $f''(x)=2$.\nApplying Itô's lemma to $f(X_t) = X_t^2$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(X_t^2) = \\left[ (-\\lambda X_t)(2X_t) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{2D})^2(2) \\right]\\mathrm{d}t + (\\sqrt{2D})(2X_t)\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(X_t^2) = (-2\\lambda X_t^2 + 2D)\\mathrm{d}t + 2\\sqrt{2D}X_t\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nTo find the evolution of the expectation, we take the expectation of the integral form of this equation. The expectation of the Itô integral term is zero, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^t 2\\sqrt{2D}X_s\\mathrm{d}W_s\\right] = 0$.\nLet $m_2(t) = \\mathbb{E}[X_t^2]$. Taking the expectation of the SDE for $X_t^2$ yields an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $m_2(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}m_2(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -2\\lambda m_2(t) + 2D\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE. The solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution, $C_1 e^{-2\\lambda t}$, and a particular solution. The particular solution is a constant, $m_{2,p} = \\frac{2D}{2\\lambda} = \\frac{D}{\\lambda}$.\nSo, $m_2(t) = C_1 e^{-2\\lambda t} + \\frac{D}{\\lambda}$.\nWe use the initial condition $m_2(0) = \\mathbb{E}[X_0^2] = M_0$ to find the constant $C_1$:\n$M_0 = C_1 e^0 + \\frac{D}{\\lambda} \\implies C_1 = M_0 - \\frac{D}{\\lambda}$.\nThus, the exact second moment at time $t$ is:\n$$\nm_2(t) = \\mathbb{E}[X_t^2] = \\left(M_0 - \\frac{D}{\\lambda}\\right)e^{-2\\lambda t} + \\frac{D}{\\lambda}\n$$\nAt the final time $T$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_T^2] = \\left(M_0 - \\frac{D}{\\lambda}\\right)e^{-2\\lambda T} + \\frac{D}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Discrete Second Moment $\\mathbb{E}[X_N^2]$**\n\nNext, we analyze the Euler-Maruyama scheme:\n$$\nX_{n+1} = (1 - \\lambda\\Delta t)X_n + \\sqrt{2D\\Delta t}\\,\\xi_n\n$$\nWe seek a recurrence relation for $M_n := \\mathbb{E}[X_n^2]$. We square $X_{n+1}$:\n$$\nX_{n+1}^2 = \\left( (1 - \\lambda\\Delta t)X_n + \\sqrt{2D\\Delta t}\\,\\xi_n \\right)^2 = (1 - \\lambda\\Delta t)^2 X_n^2 + 2(1 - \\lambda\\Delta t)\\sqrt{2D\\Delta t}\\,X_n\\xi_n + 2D\\Delta t\\,\\xi_n^2\n$$\nNow, take the expectation. We use the facts that $\\xi_n$ are i.i.d. standard normal, so $\\mathbb{E}[\\xi_n] = 0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\xi_n^2] = 1$, and that $\\xi_n$ is independent of $X_n$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{n+1}^2] = (1 - \\lambda\\Delta t)^2 \\mathbb{E}[X_n^2] + 2(1 - \\lambda\\Delta t)\\sqrt{2D\\Delta t}\\,\\mathbb{E}[X_n]\\mathbb{E}[\\xi_n] + 2D\\Delta t\\,\\mathbb{E}[\\xi_n^2]\n$$\n$$\nM_{n+1} = (1 - \\lambda\\Delta t)^2 M_n + 2D\\Delta t\n$$\nThis is a linear recurrence relation of the form $M_{n+1} = a M_n + b$ with $a = (1-\\lambda\\Delta t)^2$ and $b=2D\\Delta t$. The solution is $M_n = a^n(M_0 - C) + C$, where $C$ is the fixed point $C=aC+b \\implies C = \\frac{b}{1-a}$.\n$$\n1-a = 1 - (1-\\lambda\\Delta t)^2 = 1 - (1 - 2\\lambda\\Delta t + \\lambda^2\\Delta t^2) = 2\\lambda\\Delta t - \\lambda^2\\Delta t^2\n$$\nSo, $C = \\frac{2D\\Delta t}{2\\lambda\\Delta t - \\lambda^2\\Delta t^2} = \\frac{2D}{2\\lambda - \\lambda^2\\Delta t}$.\nThe solution for $M_n$ is:\n$$\nM_n = (1-\\lambda\\Delta t)^{2n} \\left(M_0 - \\frac{2D}{2\\lambda - \\lambda^2\\Delta t}\\right) + \\frac{2D}{2\\lambda - \\lambda^2\\Delta t}\n$$\nWe need this at step $n=N=T/\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_N^2] = M_N = (1-\\lambda\\Delta t)^{2N} \\left(M_0 - \\frac{2D}{2\\lambda - \\lambda^2\\Delta t}\\right) + \\frac{2D}{2\\lambda - \\lambda^2\\Delta t}\n$$\n\n**3. Asymptotic Expansion and Weak Error Calculation**\n\nThe weak error is $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{w}}(\\Delta t) = \\mathbb{E}[X_N^2] - \\mathbb{E}[X_T^2]$. To find the leading-order term, we expand $\\mathbb{E}[X_N^2]$ for small $\\Delta t$, holding $T = N\\Delta t$ fixed.\nFirst, we expand the different parts of the expression for $M_N$.\nTerm 1: $\\frac{2D}{2\\lambda - \\lambda^2\\Delta t} = \\frac{D}{\\lambda} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\Delta t\\right)^{-1}$. Using the geometric series expansion $(1-x)^{-1} = 1+x+\\mathcal{O}(x^2)$:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{\\lambda} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\Delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)\\right) = \\frac{D}{\\lambda} + \\frac{D}{2}\\Delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)\n$$\nTerm 2: $(1-\\lambda\\Delta t)^{2N} = (1-\\lambda\\Delta t)^{2T/\\Delta t}$. We use the expansion $\\ln(1-x) = -x - \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\mathcal{O}(x^3)$:\n$$\n(1-\\lambda\\Delta t)^{2T/\\Delta t} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2T}{\\Delta t}\\ln(1-\\lambda\\Delta t)\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2T}{\\Delta t}\\left(-\\lambda\\Delta t - \\frac{\\lambda^2\\Delta t^2}{2} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\exp\\left(-2\\lambda T - \\lambda^2 T \\Delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)\\right) = e^{-2\\lambda T} e^{-\\lambda^2 T \\Delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)}\n$$\nUsing $e^{-x} = 1 - x + \\mathcal{O}(x^2)$:\n$$\n= e^{-2\\lambda T} (1 - \\lambda^2 T \\Delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2))\n$$\nNow substitute these expansions back into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[X_N^2]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_N^2] = \\left[ M_0 - \\left(\\frac{D}{\\lambda} + \\frac{D}{2}\\Delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)\\right) \\right] \\left[ e^{-2\\lambda T}(1 - \\lambda^2 T \\Delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)) \\right] + \\left[ \\frac{D}{\\lambda} + \\frac{D}{2}\\Delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2) \\right]\n$$\nWe expand and collect terms by powers of $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_N^2] = \\left[ \\left( M_0 - \\frac{D}{\\lambda} \\right) - \\frac{D}{2}\\Delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2) \\right] \\left[ e^{-2\\lambda T} - \\lambda^2 T e^{-2\\lambda T}\\Delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2) \\right] + \\frac{D}{\\lambda} + \\frac{D}{2}\\Delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)\n$$\nThe $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ term (zeroth order in $\\Delta t$):\n$$\n\\left(M_0 - \\frac{D}{\\lambda}\\right)e^{-2\\lambda T} + \\frac{D}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThis is exactly $\\mathbb{E}[X_T^2]$, as expected.\n\nThe $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t)$ term (first order in $\\Delta t$):\nThis comes from multiplying the $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ part of the first bracket with the $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t)$ part of the second, the $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t)$ part of the first bracket with the $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ part of the second, and the $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t)$ part of the additive term.\n$$\n\\text{coeff}(\\Delta t) = \\left(M_0 - \\frac{D}{\\lambda}\\right)( - \\lambda^2 T e^{-2\\lambda T}) + \\left(-\\frac{D}{2}\\right)e^{-2\\lambda T} + \\frac{D}{2}\n$$\nSo the term is:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\left[ -\\lambda^2 T\\left(M_0 - \\frac{D}{\\lambda}\\right)e^{-2\\lambda T} - \\frac{D}{2}e^{-2\\lambda T} + \\frac{D}{2} \\right]\n$$\nThis is the leading-order term for the weak error $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{w}}(\\Delta t) = \\mathbb{E}[X_N^2] - \\mathbb{E}[X_T^2]$.
