A crucial question is how to connect the parameters of this microscopic model—the lattice spacing $a$ and time step $\\tau$—to the macroscopic diffusion coefficient $D$ that governs the continuum physics. This exercise guides you through this fundamental connection, first by deriving the diffusion equation from a discrete master equation, and then by comparing this model's effective diffusivity to the physical value predicted by the Stokes-Einstein relation . This practice is essential for ensuring that computational models are physically consistent.",

Since $\\frac{\\partial P_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{x}{\\sigma^2}P_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, this term becomes $(g + x\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} - \\frac{x^2}{\\sigma^2}g)P_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\n$\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(g P_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} P_{\\mathrm{eq}} + g \\frac{\\partial P_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\partial x}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}[(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} - \\frac{x}{\\sigma^2}g)P_{\\mathrm{eq}}] = (\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}g - \\frac{x}{\\sigma^2}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x})P_{\\mathrm{eq}} + (\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} - \\frac{x}{\\sigma^2}g)(-\\frac{x}{\\sigma^2}P_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = (\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{2x}{\\sigma^2}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} + (\\frac{x^2}{\\sigma^4}-\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2})g)P_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\n\nDividing the full equation by $P_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t} = \\gamma\\left(g + x\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} - \\frac{x^2}{\\sigma^2}g\\right) + D\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{2x}{\\sigma^2}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} + \\left(\\frac{x^2}{\\sigma^4}-\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}\\right)g\\right)\n$$\nCollecting terms by derivative of $g$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t} = D\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2} + (\\gamma x - \\frac{2Dx}{\\sigma^2})\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} + (\\gamma - \\frac{\\gamma x^2}{\\sigma^2} + \\frac{Dx^2}{\\sigma^4} - \\frac{D}{\\sigma^2})g\n$$\nSubstituting $D = \\gamma\\sigma^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t} = \\gamma\\sigma^2\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2} + (\\gamma x - \\frac{2\\gamma\\sigma^2 x}{\\sigma^2})\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} + (\\gamma - \\frac{\\gamma x^2}{\\sigma^2} + \\frac{\\gamma\\sigma^2 x^2}{\\sigma^4} - \\frac{\\gamma\\sigma^2}{\\sigma^2})g\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t} = \\gamma\\sigma^2\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2} - \\gamma x\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} + (\\gamma - \\frac{\\gamma x^2}{\\sigma^2} + \\frac{\\gamma x^2}{\\sigma^2} - \\gamma)g = \\gamma\\sigma^2\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2} - \\gamma x\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\n$$\nNow, changing variables to $y = x/\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t} = \\gamma\\sigma^2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial y^2}\\right) - \\gamma(y\\sigma)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\gamma\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial y^2} - y\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation has the form $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t} = \\mathcal{L}_g g$, where $\\mathcal{L}_g = \\gamma(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} - y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y})$. The probabilists' Hermite polynomials $H_n(y)$ satisfy the differential equation $H_n''(y) - y H_n'(y) + n H_n(y) = 0$. Therefore, the operator $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} - y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ acting on $H_n(y)$ is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} - y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)H_n(y) = -n H_n(y)\n$$\nThus, $H_n(y)$ are eigenfunctions of the operator $\\mathcal{L}_g$ with eigenvalues $\\lambda_n = -n\\gamma$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_g H_n(y) = -n\\gamma H_n(y)\n$$\n\n**3. Hermite Expansion and Spectral Solution**\n\nWe expand $g(y,t)$ in the basis of eigenfunctions $H_n(y)$: $g(y,t) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n(t) H_n(y)$.\nThe initial condition $g(y,0)$ is found from $P(x,0)$ and $P_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x)$:\n$$\ng(x,0) = \\frac{P(x,0)}{P_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp(-\\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2})}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2})} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{-x^2+2xx_0-x_0^2+x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{xx_0}{\\sigma^2} - \\frac{x_0^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\nIn terms of $y=x/\\sigma$ and the dimensionless initial displacement $y_0 = x_0/\\sigma$:\n$$\ng(y,0) = \\exp\\left(y y_0 - \\frac{y_0^2}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis is precisely the generating function for the probabilists' Hermite polynomials: $\\exp(sy-s^2/2) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{s^n}{n!}H_n(y)$. By setting $s = y_0$, we can directly read off the expansion coefficients for $g(y,0)$:\n$$\ng(y,0) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{y_0^n}{n!}H_n(y) \\quad\\implies\\quad c_n(0) = \\frac{y_0^n}{n!}\n$$\nSubstituting the series expansion for $g(y,t)$ into its evolution equation gives:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{dc_n}{dt} H_n(y) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n(t) \\mathcal{L}_g H_n(y) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n(t) (-n\\gamma) H_n(y)\n$$\nBy orthogonality, the coefficients must satisfy $\\frac{dc_n}{dt} = -n\\gamma c_n(t)$. The solution is $c_n(t) = c_n(0)e^{-n\\gamma t}$.\n$$\nc_n(t) = \\frac{y_0^n}{n!} e^{-n\\gamma t} = \\frac{(y_0 e^{-\\gamma t})^n}{n!}\n$$\nWe reconstruct $g(y,t)$ by summing the series with the time-evolved coefficients:\n$$\ng(y,t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(y_0 e^{-\\gamma t})^n}{n!} H_n(y)\n$$\nRecognizing the generating function form again, with $s(t) = y_0 e^{-\\gamma t}$, we obtain the closed-form expression:\n$$\ng(y,t) = \\exp\\left(y (y_0 e^{-\\gamma t}) - \\frac{1}{2}(y_0 e^{-\\gamma t})^2\\right)\n$$\n\n**4. Reconstruction of $P(x,t)$**\n\nFinally, we reconstruct the full probability density $P(x,t) = g(y,t) P_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x)$.\n$$\nP(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{2}\\right) \\exp\\left(y y_0 e^{-\\gamma t} - \\frac{1}{2}y_0^2 e^{-2\\gamma t}\\right)\n$$\nCombine the exponents:\n$$\n\\text{Exponent} = -\\frac{y^2}{2} + y y_0 e^{-\\gamma t} - \\frac{1}{2}y_0^2 e^{-2\\gamma t} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\left( y^2 - 2y(y_0 e^{-\\gamma t}) + (y_0 e^{-\\gamma t})^2 \\right)\n$$\nThis is a perfect square:\n$$\n\\text{Exponent} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\left( y - y_0 e^{-\\gamma t} \\right)^2\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $P(x,t)$:\n$$\nP(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y - y_0 e^{-\\gamma t})^2}{2}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we revert to the original variables $x$, $x_0$, $D$, and $\\gamma$. Using $y=x/\\sigma$, $y_0 = x_0/\\sigma$, and $\\sigma^2=D/\\gamma$:\n$$\ny - y_0 e^{-\\gamma t} = \\frac{x}{\\sigma} - \\frac{x_0}{\\sigma}e^{-\\gamma t} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}(x - x_0 e^{-\\gamma t})\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential becomes:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} (x - x_0 e^{-\\gamma t})^2 = -\\frac{(x - x_0 e^{-\\gamma t})^2}{2(D/\\gamma)} = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2D}(x - x_0 e^{-\\gamma t})^2\n$$\nThe full probability density is therefore:\n$$\nP(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(D/\\gamma)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - x_0 \\exp(-\\gamma t))^2}{2(D/\\gamma)}\\right)\n$$\nThis represents a Gaussian distribution with a time-dependent mean $\\mu(t) = x_0 \\exp(-\\gamma t)$ and a constant variance $\\sigma^2 = D/\\gamma$. The mean position decays exponentially to equilibrium at $x=0$, while the variance remains at its stationary value, as per the initial conditions.",
