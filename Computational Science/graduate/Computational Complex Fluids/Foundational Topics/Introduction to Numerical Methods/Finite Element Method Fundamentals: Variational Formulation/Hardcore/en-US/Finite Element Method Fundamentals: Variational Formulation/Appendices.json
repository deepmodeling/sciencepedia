            "solution": "The task is to determine the minimal number of quadrature points, $N$, required to exactly compute the entries of the element stiffness matrix in a Finite Element Method (FEM) context. The problem is defined by the stationary diffusion equation $-\\nabla \\cdot (\\mu \\nabla u) = f$, discretized using quadratic Lagrange ($P2$) basis functions on a triangular mesh.\n\nThe entries of the element stiffness matrix on a single triangle $K$ are given by the integral:\n$$\nA_{ij} = \\int_{K} \\mu \\, \\nabla \\varphi_{i} \\cdot \\nabla \\varphi_{j} \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nHere, $\\mu$ is a constant on the element $K$, and $\\{\\varphi_i\\}$ are the local $P2$ basis functions.\n\nTo determine the required quadrature accuracy, we must first find the polynomial degree of the integrand. This is typically done by transforming the integral from the physical element $K$ to a canonical reference element $\\hat{K}$.\n\nThe problem states that the mapping from the reference element $\\hat{K}$ to the physical element $K$ is affine:\n$$\nx = F(\\hat{x}) = B \\hat{x} + b\n$$\nwhere $B$ is the constant Jacobian matrix of the transformation and $b$ is a constant vector.

As the matrix $(B^{-1})^T$ is constant, the vector $\\nabla_x \\varphi_i$ is composed of polynomials of degree $k-1$ in $\\hat{x}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the dot product term $\\nabla \\varphi_i \\cdot \\nabla \\varphi_j$.

A numerical quadrature rule must be able to integrate all polynomials up to this degree exactly.

Since $\\eta>0$, $|K|>0$, and the tensor inner product $\\mathbf{A}:\\mathbf{A} = \\sum_{i,j} A_{ij}^2$ is non-negative, the condition $a_h(\\mathbf{v}_h, \\mathbf{v}_h) = 0$ is equivalent to the condition that the integrand vanishes at the quadrature point of every element:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{v}_h)(\\mathbf{x}_K) = \\mathbf{0} \\quad \\text{for every element } K.\n$$\nIf the only velocity fields $\\mathbf{v}_h \\in V_h$ that satisfy this condition are the rigid body motions (i.e., $\\mathbf{v}_h \\in \\mathcal{R}$), then the form $a_h$ is coercive on the quotient space $V_h / \\mathcal{R}$. However, if there exist non-rigid body motions for which $\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{v}_h)(\\mathbf{x}_K) = \\mathbf{0}$ on all elements, these are spurious (non-physical) zero-energy modes, and coercivity is lost.\n\nLet us analyze the condition $\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{v}_h)(\\mathbf{x}_K) = \\mathbf{0}$ on the reference element $\\widehat{K}=[-1,1]^2$.

Condition satisfied.\n2.  All $v_i=0$, so the condition is $0=0$. Condition satisfied.\n3.  $(-c - (-c) + c + (-c)) + (0) = (-c+c+c-c) = 0$. Condition satisfied.\n\nThis nodal velocity pattern yields $\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{v}_h)(\\mathbf{x}_K)=\\mathbf{0}$. The corresponding displacement field on the reference element is $\\mathbf{v}_h(\\xi,\\eta) = c \\sum_{i=1}^4 N_i(\\xi, \\eta) (\\pm 1) \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_x$. Substituting the nodal values gives:\n$\\mathbf{v}_h = \\frac{c}{4} [ (1-\\xi)(1-\\eta)(1) + (1+\\xi)(1-\\eta)(-1) + (1+\\xi)(1+\\eta)(1) + (1-\\xi)(1+\\eta)(-1) ] \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_x = c \\xi\\eta \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_x$.\nThis mode, $\\mathbf{v}_h = c\\xi\\eta \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_x$, is not a rigid body motion (translation or rotation). Its deformation gradient is non-zero away from the center of the element. However, its discrete energy $a_h(\\mathbf{v}_h, \\mathbf{v}_h)$ is zero. Such a mode is known as an \"hourglass mode\". On a uniform mesh, a global zero-energy mode can be constructed by setting nodal values $u_{ij} = c(-1)^{i+j}, v_{ij}=0$ for a node at grid position $(i,j)$. This satisfies the zero-energy condition on every element simultaneously.\nThe existence of such non-trivial, non-rigid-body motions in the kernel of $a_h$ proves that the bilinear form is not coercive on $V_h / \\mathcal{R}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Coercivity is generally lost on $Q_1$ meshes because nontrivial element-wise “hourglass” shear patterns exist for which $\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{u}_h)(\\mathbf{x}_K)=\\mathbf{0}$ on every element center while $\\mathbf{u}_h\\notin \\mathcal{R}$, leading to zero discrete viscous energy; these modes can be constructed by alternating nodal velocities along element edges.**\nThis statement accurately describes the situation. As derived above, coercivity is lost precisely because of the existence of spurious zero-energy modes. These modes are correctly identified as \"hourglass\" patterns. The condition $\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{u}_h)(\\mathbf{x}_K)=\\mathbf{0}$ is the mathematical reason for the zero discrete energy. The fact that these modes are not rigid-body motions ($\\mathbf{u}_h\\notin \\mathcal{R}$) is what makes them spurious. The description of their construction via \"alternating nodal velocities\" is also correct, as shown by the example $u_{ij} = c(-1)^{i+j}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Coercivity is preserved by Korn’s inequality, so the only zero-energy modes are rigid body motions; under-integration of $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ does not introduce any additional kernel on $Q_1$ meshes.**\nKorn's inequality guarantees the coercivity of the *continuous* bilinear form $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$, which involves an integral over the domain. The discrete form $a_h(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ replaces this integral with a sum of function evaluations at single points. This quadrature is not sufficient to control the norm of the symmetric gradient over the whole domain (i.e., a discrete Korn's inequality does not hold for this form). Therefore, the premise that coercivity is preserved is false. Our derivation explicitly showed that under-integration *does* introduce an additional kernel, invalidating the second part of the statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Coercivity is lost, but the only spurious zero-energy modes that appear are pressure checkerboard patterns due to violation of the Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi inf-sup condition; the velocity space remains unaffected by under-integration of $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$.**\nThis option confuses two different types of numerical instabilities. The loss of coercivity of the viscous term, as described in the problem, leads to spurious modes in the *velocity* field (hourglass modes). Pressure checkerboard patterns are spurious modes in the *pressure* field, arising from a poor choice of discrete spaces for velocity and pressure that violates the LBB (inf-sup) stability condition. The problem setup pertains only to the viscous term and its effect on the velocity space; the pressure space and the LBB condition are not mentioned and are irrelevant to the specific mechanism of hourglassing. The claim that the velocity space is unaffected is the principal error here.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Coercivity is preserved on $Q_1$ quadrilateral meshes with one-point quadrature, but would be lost on $P_1$ triangular meshes because the symmetric gradient is under-integrated there, producing spurious shear modes on triangles.**\nThis statement is incorrect in both its claims. As established, coercivity is *lost* on $Q_1$ quadrilateral meshes with one-point quadrature. Conversely, for a linear triangular element ($P_1$), the gradient of any component of the velocity field is constant on the element. Therefore, $\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{u}_h)$ is also a constant tensor on each element. For a constant integrand, the one-point quadrature rule (at the barycenter) is *exact*. Thus, $a_h(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ on a $P_1$ mesh is identical to the fully integrated discrete form, which is known to be coercive modulo rigid body motions. No under-integration occurs for $P_1$ elements in this context, and no spurious modes are introduced. The statement has the facts reversed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
