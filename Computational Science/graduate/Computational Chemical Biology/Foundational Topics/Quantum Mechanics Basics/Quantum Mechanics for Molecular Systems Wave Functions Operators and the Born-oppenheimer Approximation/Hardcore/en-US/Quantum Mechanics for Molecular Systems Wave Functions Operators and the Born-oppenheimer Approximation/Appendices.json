A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet the two hydrogen nuclei, A and B, be located at positions $\\mathbf{R}_A = (0, 0, -R/2)$ and $\\mathbf{R}_B = (0, 0, R/2)$ respectively. The hydrogenic $1s$ atomic orbitals centered on these nuclei are:\n$$ \\phi_A(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi a_0^3}} \\exp(-|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_A|/a_0) $$\n$$ \\phi_B(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi a_0^3}} \\exp(-|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_B|/a_0) $$\nThese atomic orbitals are normalized, i.e., $\\int |\\phi_A(\\mathbf{r})|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r} = \\int |\\phi_B(\\mathbf{r})|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r} = 1$.\n\n**1. Normalization of Molecular Orbitals**\n\nThe unnormalized bonding (gerade, $\\psi_g'$) and antibonding (ungerade, $\\psi_u'$) molecular orbitals are formed by the symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of the atomic orbitals:\n$$ \\psi_g'(\\mathbf{r}) = \\phi_A(\\mathbf{r}) + \\phi_B(\\mathbf{r}) $$\n$$ \\psi_u'(\\mathbf{r}) = \\phi_A(\\mathbf{r}) - \\phi_B(\\mathbf{r}) $$\n\nTo normalize these orbitals, we require $\\int |\\psi(\\mathbf{r})|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r} = 1$. Let the normalized orbitals be $\\psi_g = N_g \\psi_g'$ and $\\psi_u = N_u \\psi_u'$.\n\nFor the bonding orbital $\\psi_g$:\n$$ \\int |N_g(\\phi_A + \\phi_B)|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r} = N_g^2 \\int (\\phi_A^2 + \\phi_B^2 + 2\\phi_A\\phi_B) \\,\\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r} = 1 $$\nUsing the normalization of AOs and the definition of the overlap integral $S(R) = \\int \\phi_A \\phi_B \\,\\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}$:\n$$ N_g^2 (1 + 1 + 2S(R)) = 1 \\implies N_g = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1+S(R))}} $$\n\nFor the antibonding orbital $\\psi_u$:\n$$ \\int |N_u(\\phi_A - \\phi_B)|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r} = N_u^2 \\int (\\phi_A^2 + \\phi_B^2 - 2\\phi_A\\phi_B) \\,\\mathrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r} = 1 $$\n$$ N_u^2 (1 + 1 - 2S(R)) = 1 \\implies N_u = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1-S(R))}} $$\n\nThus, the normalized molecular orbitals are:\n$$ \\psi_g(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1+S(R))}} (\\phi_A(\\mathbf{r}) + \\phi_B(\\mathbf{r})) $$\n$$ \\psi_u(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1-S(R))}} (\\phi_A(\\mathbf{r}) - \\phi_B(\\mathbf{r})) $$\nThe evaluation of the overlap integral $S(R)$ for two $1s$ orbitals is a standard result:\n$$ S(R) = \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{a_0} + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{R}{a_0}\\right)^2\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R}{a_0}\\right) $$\n\n**2. Nodal Structure and Symmetry**\n\nThe labels $g$ (gerade, 'even') and $u$ (ungerade, 'odd') refer to the symmetry of the wavefunction upon inversion through the center of symmetry (the origin $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{0}$). An inversion operation sends $\\mathbf{r} \\to -\\mathbf{r}$. Under this operation, $\\mathbf{R}_A \\to -\\mathbf{R}_A = \\mathbf{R}_B$ and $\\mathbf{R}_B \\to -\\mathbf{R}_B = \\mathbf{R}_A$, which implies $\\phi_A(-\\mathbf{r}) = \\phi_B(\\mathbf{r})$ and $\\phi_B(-\\mathbf{r}) = \\phi_A(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\n-   **Bonding orbital ($\\psi_g$)**:\n    Symmetry: $\\psi_g(-\\mathbf{r}) = N_g (\\phi_A(-\\mathbf{r}) + \\phi_B(-\\mathbf{r})) = N_g (\\phi_B(\\mathbf{r}) + \\phi_A(\\mathbf{r})) = \\psi_g(\\mathbf{r})$. The wavefunction is symmetric (gerade) with respect to inversion.\n    Nodal Structure: Since $\\phi_A$ and $\\phi_B$ are constructed from $1s$ orbitals, they are positive everywhere. Their sum, $\\psi_g$, is therefore also positive everywhere and has no nodes. This leads to an accumulation of electron density between the nuclei, which is characteristic of a chemical bond.\n\n-   **Antibonding orbital ($\\psi_u$)**:\n    Symmetry: $\\psi_u(-\\mathbf{r}) = N_u (\\phi_A(-\\mathbf{r}) - \\phi_B(-\\mathbf{r})) = N_u (\\phi_B(\\mathbf{r}) - \\phi_A(\\mathbf{r})) = -N_u (\\phi_A(\\mathbf{r}) - \\phi_B(\\mathbf{r})) = -\\psi_u(\\mathbf{r})$. The wavefunction is antisymmetric (ungerade) with respect to inversion.\n    Nodal Structure: A node exists where $\\psi_u(\\mathbf{r})=0$. This occurs when $\\phi_A(\\mathbf{r}) - \\phi_B(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$, or $\\phi_A(\\mathbf{r}) = \\phi_B(\\mathbf{r})$. This equality holds for all points $\\mathbf{r}$ equidistant from the two nuclei, i.e., $|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_A| = |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_B|$. This defines the plane perpendicular to the internuclear axis and passing through the midpoint, which is the $xy$-plane at $z=0$. This nodal plane between the nuclei signifies a depletion of electron density, leading to repulsion.\n\nBoth MOs are cylindrically symmetric about the internuclear ($z$) axis, and are therefore designated as $\\sigma$ orbitals ($\\sigma_g$ and $\\sigma_u^*$).\n\n**3. Electron Density at the Bond Midpoint**\n\nIn the ground electronic state of $\\text{H}_2$, two electrons with opposite spins occupy the bonding molecular orbital $\\psi_g$. The total spatial wavefunction is $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) = \\psi_g(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\psi_g(\\mathbf{r}_2)$. The spin-summed electron density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ is the contribution from both electrons, which for a doubly occupied orbital is given by:\n$$ \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = 2|\\psi_g(\\mathbf{r})|^2 $$\nWe need to evaluate this at the bond midpoint, $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n$$ \\rho(\\mathbf{0}) = 2|\\psi_g(\\mathbf{0})|^2 $$\nFirst, we find $\\psi_g(\\mathbf{0})$:\n$$ \\psi_g(\\mathbf{0}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1+S(R))}} (\\phi_A(\\mathbf{0}) + \\phi_B(\\mathbf{0})) $$\nAt the origin, the distances to the nuclei are $|\\mathbf{0} - \\mathbf{R}_A| = R/2$ and $|\\mathbf{0} - \\mathbf{R}_B| = R/2$. Thus, $\\phi_A(\\mathbf{0}) = \\phi_B(\\mathbf{0})$.\n$$ \\phi_A(\\mathbf{0}) = \\phi_B(\\mathbf{0}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi a_0^3}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R}{2a_0}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\psi_g(\\mathbf{0})$:\n$$ \\psi_g(\\mathbf{0}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1+S(R))}} \\left( 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi a_0^3}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R}{2a_0}\\right) \\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{1+S(R)}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi a_0^3}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R}{2a_0}\\right) $$\nNow, we compute the density $\\rho(\\mathbf{0})$:\n$$ \\rho(\\mathbf{0}) = 2 |\\psi_g(\\mathbf{0})|^2 = 2 \\left( \\frac{2}{1+S(R)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\pi a_0^3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R}{a_0}\\right) \\right) $$\n$$ \\rho(\\mathbf{0}) = \\frac{4 \\exp(-R/a_0)}{\\pi a_0^3 (1+S(R))} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $S(R)$:\n$$ \\rho(\\mathbf{0}) = \\frac{4 \\exp(-R/a_0)}{\\pi a_0^3 \\left[1 + \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{a_0} + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{R}{a_0}\\right)^2\\right) \\exp(-R/a_0)\\right]} $$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nThe problem requests the numerical value of $\\rho(\\mathbf{0})$ in units of $a_0^{-3}$. We set $a_0=1$ and use $R = 1.402$. Let $x = R/a_0 = 1.402$.\nFirst, calculate the overlap integral $S$:\n$$ S = \\left(1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{3}\\right) \\exp(-x) = \\left(1 + 1.402 + \\frac{1.402^2}{3}\\right) \\exp(-1.402) $$\n$$ S = \\left(2.402 + \\frac{1.965604}{3}\\right) \\exp(-1.402) \\approx (2.402 + 0.65520133) \\times 0.24611403 $$\n$$ S \\approx 3.05720133 \\times 0.24611403 \\approx 0.7522495 $$\nNow, calculate the numerical prefactor for the density, $\\rho(\\mathbf{0})a_0^3$:\n$$ \\rho(\\mathbf{0})a_0^3 = \\frac{4 \\exp(-x)}{\\pi (1+S)} = \\frac{4 \\exp(-1.402)}{\\pi (1+0.7522495)} $$\n$$ \\rho(\\mathbf{0})a_0^3 = \\frac{4 \\times 0.24611403}{\\pi \\times 1.7522495} \\approx \\frac{0.98445612}{5.5048563} \\approx 0.1788339 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.1788$.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It poses a standard, solvable problem in quantum mechanics—the derivation of the energy levels for a simple harmonic oscillator, which serves as a fundamental model for molecular vibrations under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. All terms are formally defined and appropriate for a rigorous physical analysis. The problem is therefore valid. We shall proceed with the derivation from first principles.\n\nThe system described is a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, which models the vibrational motion of a diatomic molecule along its internuclear axis. The motion is described by the mass-weighted vibrational coordinate $q = R - R_{e}$, where $R$ is the internuclear separation and $R_{e}$ is its equilibrium value. The effective mass for this motion is the reduced mass $\\mu$.\n\nThe starting point is the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) for the nuclear wavefunction $\\psi(q)$:\n$$\n\\hat{H} \\psi(q) = E \\psi(q)\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator for the nuclear motion and $E$ represents the quantized vibrational energy levels. The Hamiltonian is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy operators, $\\hat{H} = \\hat{T} + \\hat{V}$.\n\nThe kinetic energy operator for a particle of mass $\\mu$ moving in one dimension ($q$) is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{T} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} \\frac{d^2}{dq^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe potential energy surface $V(q)$ is approximated by its Taylor series expansion around the equilibrium position $q=0$:\n$$\nV(q) = V(0) + \\left.\\frac{dV}{dq}\\right|_{q=0} q + \\frac{1}{2} \\left.\\frac{d^2V}{dq^2}\\right|_{q=0} q^2 + \\mathcal{O}(q^3)\n$$\nBy definition, the equilibrium position $q=0$ is a minimum of the potential, so the first derivative $\\left.\\frac{dV}{dq}\\right|_{q=0} = 0$. We can set the potential at equilibrium to zero, $V(0) = 0$, as this only shifts the absolute energy scale. The problem states that we retain the leading non-constant term, which is the quadratic term. Using the provided definition of the force constant, $k = \\left.\\frac{d^2V}{dq^2}\\right|_{q=0}$, the potential energy simplifies to the harmonic potential:\n$$\nV(q) = \\frac{1}{2} k q^2\n$$\nThe corresponding potential energy operator is $\\hat{V} = \\frac{1}{2} k \\hat{q}^2$, where $\\hat{q}$ is the position operator (multiplication by $q$).\n\nThe full Hamiltonian operator for the quantum harmonic oscillator is thus:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} \\frac{d^2}{dq^2} + \\frac{1}{2} k q^2\n$$\nTo solve for the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian, we employ the algebraic or \"ladder operator\" method, which relies on the fundamental commutation relation between the position operator $\\hat{q}$ and the momentum operator $\\hat{p} = -i\\hbar \\frac{d}{dq}$:\n$$\n[\\hat{q}, \\hat{p}] = \\hat{q}\\hat{p} - \\hat{p}\\hat{q} = i\\hbar\n$$\nFirst, we rewrite the Hamiltonian in terms of $\\hat{q}$ and $\\hat{p}$:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2\\mu} + \\frac{1}{2} k \\hat{q}^2\n$$\nLet us define the classical angular frequency of the oscillator as $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}$.

The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are directly related to the eigenvalues of $\\hat{N}$. Let $|\\psi_n\\rangle$ be an eigenstate of $\\hat{N}$ with eigenvalue $n$.\n$$\n\\hat{N}|\\psi_n\\rangle = n |\\psi_n\\rangle\n$$\nThen the energy of this state is $E_n = \\hbar\\omega(n + \\frac{1}{2})$. The problem reduces to finding the allowed values of $n$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $\\hat{N}$ must be non-negative, since $\\langle\\psi|\\hat{N}|\\psi\\rangle = \\langle\\psi|\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}|\\psi\\rangle = \\langle\\hat{a}\\psi|\\hat{a}\\psi\\rangle = \\| \\hat{a}|\\psi\\rangle \\|^2 \\ge 0$. This implies there must be a state of lowest eigenvalue, the ground state, which we denote $|\\psi_0\\rangle$. If we apply the annihilation operator $\\hat{a}$ to this state, we cannot obtain a state with a lower eigenvalue. The only possibility is that this operation results in the zero vector:\n$$\n\\hat{a}|\\psi_0\\rangle = 0\n$$\nOperating on this equation with $\\hat{N}$:\n$$\n\\hat{N}|\\psi_0\\rangle = \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}|\\psi_0\\rangle = \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}(0) = 0\n$$\nThus, the lowest eigenvalue of the number operator is $n=0$. All other eigenstates can be generated by repeated application of the creation operator $\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}$. It can be shown that $[\\hat{N}, \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}] = \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}$, which implies that if $|\\psi_n\\rangle$ is an eigenstate with eigenvalue $n$, then $\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}|\\psi_n\\rangle$ is an eigenstate with eigenvalue $n+1$. Starting from $n=0$, we generate the complete set of eigenvalues for $\\hat{N}$, which are the non-negative integers: $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nThe quantized vibrational energy levels are therefore:\n$$\nE_n = \\hbar\\omega\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right), \\quad n = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\n$$\nThe zero-point energy (ZPE) is defined as the minimum possible energy of the system, which corresponds to the ground state energy.

            "solution": "Under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BO), the nuclei are fixed and the electronic Hamiltonian acts only on electronic coordinates. For a two-electron system with spatial orbitals $\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r})$ and $\\phi_q(\\mathbf{r})$, indistinguishability and the Pauli exclusion principle require that the total wave function be antisymmetric under exchange of the two electrons. This total wave function is the product of a spatial part and a spin part. For the total spin singlet, the spin part is antisymmetric; therefore, the spatial part must be symmetric. For the total spin triplet, the spin part is symmetric; therefore, the spatial part must be antisymmetric. Because the electron-electron repulsion operator $\\hat{V}_{ee} = \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2|}$ acts only on spatial coordinates, its expectation value depends only on the spatial component of the total wave function, with the spin part contributing a unit normalization factor.\n\nLet us define the normalized spatial functions for the singlet and triplet configurations in which one electron occupies orbital $\\phi_p$ and the other occupies orbital $\\phi_q$:\n$$\n\\Phi_{S}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2) \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\,\\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_2) + \\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\,\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\right],\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi_{T}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2) \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\,\\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_2) - \\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\,\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\right].\n$$\nThe corresponding total states are $\\Psi_{S} = \\Phi_{S}\\,\\chi_{S}$ and $\\Psi_{T} = \\Phi_{T}\\,\\chi_{T}$, where $\\chi_{S}$ is the antisymmetric spin singlet function, and $\\chi_{T}$ is one of the symmetric triplet spin functions. Since $\\hat{V}_{ee}$ acts only on spatial coordinates, we have\n$$\n\\langle \\Psi_{S} | \\hat{V}_{ee} | \\Psi_{S} \\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_{S} | \\hat{V}_{ee} | \\Phi_{S} \\rangle,\\qquad\n\\langle \\Psi_{T} | \\hat{V}_{ee} | \\Psi_{T} \\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_{T} | \\hat{V}_{ee} | \\Phi_{T} \\rangle,\n$$\nwith the spin parts giving unity due to normalization.\n\nWe now evaluate these spatial expectation values. Expand the singlet expectation:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\langle \\Phi_{S} | \\hat{V}_{ee} | \\Phi_{S} \\rangle\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\iint d\\mathbf{r}_1\\,d\\mathbf{r}_2\\,\\left[\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_2) + \\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\right] \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2|} \\left[\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_2) + \\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\right] \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\left( I_{pp,qq} + I_{pq,qp} + I_{qp,pq} + I_{qq,pp} \\right),\n\\end{align*}\nwhere we have introduced the shorthand for the four terms:\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{pp,qq} \\equiv \\iint d\\mathbf{r}_1\\,d\\mathbf{r}_2\\, \\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\,\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2|}\\,\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_2), \\\\\nI_{pq,qp} \\equiv \\iint d\\mathbf{r}_1\\,d\\mathbf{r}_2\\, \\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\,\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2|}\\,\\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_2), \\\\\nI_{qp,pq} \\equiv \\iint d\\mathbf{r}_1\\,d\\mathbf{r}_2\\, \\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\,\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2|}\\,\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_2), \\\\\nI_{qq,pp} \\equiv \\iint d\\mathbf{r}_1\\,d\\mathbf{r}_2\\, \\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\,\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2|}\\,\\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_2).\n\\end{align*}\nBecause the orbitals are real-valued and orthonormal, and $\\hat{V}_{ee}$ is symmetric under exchange of $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2$, these integrals simplify to the Coulomb and exchange integrals. Specifically,\n$$\nI_{pp,qq} = J_{pq}, \\qquad I_{qq,pp} = J_{pq},\n$$\nand\n$$\nI_{pq,qp} = K_{pq}, \\qquad I_{qp,pq} = K_{pq}.\n$$\nHence,\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_{S} | \\hat{V}_{ee} | \\Phi_{S} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(J_{pq} + K_{pq} + K_{pq} + J_{pq}\\right) = J_{pq} + K_{pq}.\n$$\n\nFor the triplet spatial function, the minus sign changes the interference (exchange) terms:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\langle \\Phi_{T} | \\hat{V}_{ee} | \\Phi_{T} \\rangle\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\iint d\\mathbf{r}_1\\,d\\mathbf{r}_2\\,\\left[\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_2) - \\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\right] \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2|} \\left[\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_2) - \\phi_q(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_p(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\right] \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\left( I_{pp,qq} - I_{pq,qp} - I_{qp,pq} + I_{qq,pp} \\right) \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(J_{pq} - K_{pq} - K_{pq} + J_{pq}\\right) \\\\\n= J_{pq} - K_{pq}.\n\\end{align*}\nThus, exchange symmetry enters through the sign of the exchange integral $K_{pq}$: it adds in the singlet case (symmetric spatial state) and subtracts in the triplet case (antisymmetric spatial state), while the direct Coulomb term $J_{pq}$ is common to both.\n\nArranging the two expectation values as requested (singlet first, triplet second), we obtain the pair\n$$\n\\left( \\langle \\hat{V}_{ee} \\rangle_{\\text{singlet}},\\; \\langle \\hat{V}_{ee} \\rangle_{\\text{triplet}} \\right) = \\left( J_{pq} + K_{pq},\\; J_{pq} - K_{pq} \\right).\n$$",
