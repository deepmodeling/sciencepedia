            "problem": "A central component of empirical and knowledge-based scoring functions for biomolecular binding is the desolvation contribution, which approximates the reversible work associated with removing solvent from molecular surfaces that become buried upon complex formation. Starting from the principle that the reversible work to change solvent exposure of a surface element can be approximated by a surface work coefficient times an area element, and that the total work is obtained by summing over the interface where solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) is reduced, derive an atomistic discrete expression for the desolvation contribution by partitioning the interface into per-atom surface elements.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a discrete atomistic expression for the desolvation contribution to the binding free energy and its subsequent evaluation for a given protein-ligand complex.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression. The problem states that the reversible work, $\\delta W$, required to change the solvent exposure of an infinitesimal surface element of area $\\delta A$ is proportional to this area. This can be written as $\\delta W = s_t \\, \\delta A$, where $s_t$ is the surface work coefficient for the specific atom type $t$ constituting the surface element. The total desolvation contribution, which we denote as $\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv}}$, is the sum of these work contributions over the entire interface created upon complex formation. In an atomistic model, we discretize this by summing the contributions from each atom $i$ that has its solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) reduced.\n\nLet $\\Delta A_i$ be the reduction in SASA for atom $i$ upon binding, where $\\Delta A_i \\ge 0$. Let $t(i)$ be the atom type of atom $i$. The desolvation energy contribution from atom $i$ is $s_{t(i)} \\Delta A_i$. The total desolvation contribution is the sum over all atoms $i$ on both the protein and the ligand whose SASA decreases upon complex formation. The discrete atomistic expression is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv}} = \\sum_{i} s_{t(i)} \\Delta A_i\n$$\nwhere the sum runs over all specified atoms at the interface.\n\nNext, we evaluate this quantity for the given complex.

Consider two ligand–protein docking poses, A and B, scored by a knowledge-based potential in units of Boltzmann constant times temperature ($k_B T$). The scores are $S_A=-12.0$ (in $k_B T$ units) and $S_B=-10.5$ (in $k_B T$ units) at temperature $T=298$ K. At $T=298$ K, the thermal energy is given as $k_B T = 0.593$ kcal/mol.

The intermediate conversion to energy must be expressed in kcal/mol (do not report the intermediate energies in any other unit).",
            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics applied to computational chemistry, specifically the use of knowledge-based scoring functions. All necessary data are provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we convert the dimensionless scores, $S_A$ and $S_B$, into energies in units of kcal/mol. A knowledge-based score $S$ expressed in units of $k_B T$ is, by definition, the energy $E$ divided by the thermal energy $k_B T$. Therefore, the energy $E$ is given by the relation:\n$$\nE = S \\times (k_B T)\n$$\nWe are given the scores $S_A = -12.0$ and $S_B = -10.5$. The thermal energy at the specified temperature of $T=298$ K is given as $k_B T = 0.593$ kcal/mol.\n\nFor pose A, the energy $E_A$ is calculated as:\n$$\nE_A = S_A \\times (k_B T) = -12.0 \\times 0.593 \\, \\text{kcal/mol} = -7.116 \\, \\text{kcal/mol}\n$$\nFor pose B, the energy $E_B$ is calculated as:\n$$\nE_B = S_B \\times (k_B T) = -10.5 \\times 0.593 \\, \\text{kcal/mol} = -6.2265 \\, \\text{kcal/mol}\n$$\n\nSecond, we assess the transformation of the pose score difference under this unit conversion. The difference in the dimensionless scores, $\\Delta S$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta S = S_A - S_B = -12.0 - (-10.5) = -1.5\n$$\nThe difference in the energies, $\\Delta E$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_A - E_B = -7.116 \\, \\text{kcal/mol} - (-6.2265 \\, \\text{kcal/mol}) = -0.8895 \\, \\text{kcal/mol}\n$$\nThe relationship between the energy difference and the score difference can be derived from the fundamental definition:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_A - E_B = S_A (k_B T) - S_B (k_B T) = (S_A - S_B) (k_B T) = \\Delta S \\times (k_B T)\n$$\nVerifying with our calculated values:\n$$\n\\Delta E = -1.5 \\times 0.593 \\, \\text{kcal/mol} = -0.8895 \\, \\text{kcal/mol}\n$$\nThis confirms that the transformation is linear. The energy difference in kcal/mol is obtained by multiplying the dimensionless score difference by the value of $k_B T$ in kcal/mol.\n\nThird, we determine the ratio of the canonical ensemble selection probabilities for pose A compared to pose B. According to the principles of statistical thermodynamics, the probability $P_i$ of observing a system in a specific state $i$ with energy $E_i$ at a constant temperature $T$ is governed by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\nP_i = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_i}{k_B T}\\right)}{Z}\n$$\nwhere $Z = \\sum_j \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_j}{k_B T}\\right)$ is the canonical partition function, a normalization constant that sums over all possible states $j$ of the system.\n\nThe ratio of the probabilities for pose A and pose B, $\\frac{P_A}{P_B}$, is:\n$$\n\\frac{P_A}{P_B} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{Z}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{Z}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_B}{k_B T}\\right)}\n$$\nThe partition function $Z$ cancels out, leaving:\n$$\n\\frac{P_A}{P_B} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_B}{k_B T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_B T} + \\frac{E_B}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A - E_B}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe exponent in this expression, $-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}$, is precisely the negative of the difference in the dimensionless scores, $-\\Delta S$. This is because $\\Delta S = S_A-S_B = \\frac{E_A}{k_B T} - \\frac{E_B}{k_B T} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}$.\nThus, the probability ratio can be calculated directly from the scores:\n$$\n\\frac{P_A}{P_B} = \\exp[-(S_A - S_B)] = \\exp(-\\Delta S)\n$$\nSubstituting the value $\\Delta S = -1.5$:\n$$\n\\frac{P_A}{P_B} = \\exp(-(-1.5)) = \\exp(1.5)\n$$\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for this ratio:\n$$\n\\exp(1.5) \\approx 4.48168907\n$$\nThe problem asks for the final numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\frac{P_A}{P_B} \\approx 4.482\n$$",
