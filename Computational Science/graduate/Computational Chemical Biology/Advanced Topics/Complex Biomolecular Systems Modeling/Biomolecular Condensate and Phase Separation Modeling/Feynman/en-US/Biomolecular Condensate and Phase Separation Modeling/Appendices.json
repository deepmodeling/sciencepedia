The tendency to mix or demix is governed by the free energy landscape, where the spinodal boundary delineates the region of unconditional instability, leading to spontaneous phase separation. This exercise  offers crucial practice in analyzing this free energy function to derive the spinodal condition, a core skill for modeling the thermodynamic driving forces of biomolecular condensation.",

            "problem": "Consider a coarse-grained description of a multivalent protein (treated as a polymer of polymerization degree $N$) undergoing liquid–liquid phase separation with a bath of solvent. In the mean-field Flory–Huggins theory (Flory–Huggins (FH) theory), the Helmholtz free-energy density of mixing per Boltzmann constant times temperature, $f/(k_B T)$, for a polymer volume fraction $c \\in (0,1)$ can be modeled as the sum of an ideal mixing entropy contribution and an enthalpic interaction contribution characterized by the dimensionless Flory–Huggins parameter $\\chi$. From a stability analysis, the spinodal compositions are defined as those $c$ at which the curvature of the free-energy density with respect to $c$ vanishes, i.e., $f''(c)=0$, marking the boundary between metastable and unstable regimes.\n\nStarting from the standard FH free-energy density per $k_B T$ for a polymer solution, derive the spinodal condition $f''(c)=0$ and solve for the two spinodal compositions $c_{-}$ and $c_{+}$ as functions of $N$ and $\\chi$. Then, for $N=10$ and $\\chi=1.5$, compute the explicit values of $c_{-}$ and $c_{+}$. Express the final answers as exact analytic expressions (no rounding).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the spinodal compositions within the framework of the Flory-Huggins (FH) theory for a polymer solution. The spinodal compositions mark the boundary of thermodynamic instability and are defined by the condition where the second derivative of the free-energy density with respect to the composition is zero.\n\nThe standard FH expression for the Helmholtz free energy of mixing per lattice site, divided by the thermal energy $k_B T$, is a function of the polymer volume fraction $c$. This quantity is dimensionless and will be denoted by $\\tilde{f}(c)$. It is given by the sum of the mixing entropy (ideal term) and the interaction enthalpy (regular solution term):\n$$ \\tilde{f}(c) = \\frac{c}{N} \\ln(c) + (1-c) \\ln(1-c) + \\chi c(1-c) $$\nHere, $N$ is the degree of polymerization of the polymer chains, and $\\chi$ is the dimensionless Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, which quantifies the effective interaction energy between polymer segments and solvent molecules. The volume fraction of the solvent is $1-c$.\n\nThe spinodal curve is determined by the condition $f''(c)=0$. Since $\\tilde{f}(c)$ is directly proportional to the free-energy density $f(c)$, this condition is equivalent to $\\frac{d^2\\tilde{f}}{dc^2} = 0$. We proceed by calculating the first and second derivatives of $\\tilde{f}(c)$ with respect to $c$.\n\nThe first derivative, $\\tilde{f}'(c)$, is:\n$$ \\tilde{f}'(c) = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left[ \\frac{c}{N} \\ln(c) + (1-c) \\ln(1-c) + \\chi(c-c^2) \\right] $$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation, we get:\n$$ \\tilde{f}'(c) = \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\ln(c) + \\frac{c}{N} \\cdot \\frac{1}{c} \\right) + \\left( -1 \\cdot \\ln(1-c) + (1-c) \\cdot \\frac{-1}{1-c} \\right) + \\chi(1-2c) $$\n$$ \\tilde{f}'(c) = \\frac{1}{N} \\ln(c) + \\frac{1}{N} - \\ln(1-c) - 1 + \\chi(1-2c) $$\n\nThe second derivative, $\\tilde{f}''(c)$, is found by differentiating $\\tilde{f}'(c)$:\n$$ \\tilde{f}''(c) = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N} \\ln(c) + \\frac{1}{N} - \\ln(1-c) - 1 + \\chi(1-2c) \\right] $$\n$$ \\tilde{f}''(c) = \\frac{1}{N} \\cdot \\frac{1}{c} - \\left( \\frac{-1}{1-c} \\right) - 2\\chi $$\n$$ \\tilde{f}''(c) = \\frac{1}{Nc} + \\frac{1}{1-c} - 2\\chi $$\n\nThe spinodal condition is $\\tilde{f}''(c) = 0$. Therefore, the equation for the spinodal compositions is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{Nc} + \\frac{1}{1-c} - 2\\chi = 0 $$\nTo solve for $c$, we first combine the fractions on the left-hand side:\n$$ \\frac{(1-c) + Nc}{Nc(1-c)} = 2\\chi $$\n$$ 1 - c + Nc = 2\\chi Nc(1-c) $$\n$$ 1 + (N-1)c = 2\\chi Nc - 2\\chi Nc^2 $$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form $ac^2+bc+d=0$:\n$$ (2\\chi N)c^2 + (N-1 - 2\\chi N)c + 1 = 0 $$\nThe two spinodal compositions, $c_-$ and $c_+$, are the roots of this quadratic equation. We use the quadratic formula $c = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ad}}{2a}$:\n$$ c_{\\pm} = \\frac{-(N-1 - 2\\chi N) \\pm \\sqrt{(N-1 - 2\\chi N)^2 - 4(2\\chi N)(1)}}{2(2\\chi N)} $$\n$$ c_{\\pm} = \\frac{2\\chi N - N + 1 \\pm \\sqrt{(N-1 - 2\\chi N)^2 - 8\\chi N}}{4\\chi N} $$\nThis expression provides the general solution for the spinodal compositions $c_{-}$ and $c_{+}$ as functions of $N$ and $\\chi$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given specific values $N=10$ and $\\chi=1.5$ into the quadratic equation for $c$.\nThe coefficients of the quadratic equation become:\n$a = 2\\chi N = 2(1.5)(10) = 30$\n$b = N-1 - 2\\chi N = 10-1 - 2(1.5)(10) = 9 - 30 = -21$\n$d = 1$\n\nThe equation for the spinodal compositions is therefore:\n$$ 30c^2 - 21c + 1 = 0 $$\nWe solve this for $c$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$ c = \\frac{-(-21) \\pm \\sqrt{(-21)^2 - 4(30)(1)}}{2(30)} $$\n$$ c = \\frac{21 \\pm \\sqrt{441 - 120}}{60} $$\n$$ c = \\frac{21 \\pm \\sqrt{321}}{60} $$\nThe two distinct roots correspond to the spinodal compositions $c_-$ and $c_+$. By convention, $c_-$ is the smaller value and $c_+$ is the larger value.\n$$ c_{-} = \\frac{21 - \\sqrt{321}}{60} $$\n$$ c_{+} = \\frac{21 + \\sqrt{321}}{60} $$\nThese are the exact analytical expressions for the spinodal compositions for the given parameters.",

The strength of these effective attractive contacts is captured by $\\chi_{\\mathrm{assoc}}$, which is proportional to the enrichment factor $g$. For the block sequence, $g_{\\mathrm{block}} = 29/9 \\approx 3.22$, which is significantly larger than $g_{\\mathrm{disp}} = 1$. This implies that arranging stickers into a contiguous block greatly enhances the probability of forming inter-chain sticker-sticker contacts compared to dispersing them randomly along the polymer chain. The high local concentration of stickers within the block promotes multivalent interactions with other sticker blocks, creating stronger effective cross-links that drive phase separation. This increased effective attraction means that the system can phase separate at a higher temperature, as more thermal energy is required to disrupt these favorable inter-chain contacts. Consequently, $T_c^{\\mathrm{block}} > T_c^{\\mathrm{disp}}$, leading to a positive $\\Delta T_c$.",
