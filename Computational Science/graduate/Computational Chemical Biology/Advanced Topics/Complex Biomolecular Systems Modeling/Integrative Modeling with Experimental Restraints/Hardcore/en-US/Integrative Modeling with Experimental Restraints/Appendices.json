            "introduction": "The first step in any integrative modeling project is to translate experimental measurements into a quantitative scoring function. This function, often expressed as an energy or likelihood, guides the search for structures that are consistent with the data. This exercise  focuses on creating one of the most common types of restraints from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy: a distance restraint derived from the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE), which provides information about pairs of atoms that are close in space. You will construct a mathematically precise \"flat-bottom\" potential that correctly penalizes atomic arrangements that violate the experimentally observed distance bounds, a fundamental skill for encoding experimental knowledge into a computational model.",

            "problem": "In integrative structural modeling of biomolecules, different experimental modalities such as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) contribute complementary restraints to a single scoring function. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) observed in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) provides short-range distance information between nuclear spins, with the observed cross-relaxation rates approximately scaling as $r_{ij}^{-6}$ for a pair of nuclei $i$ and $j$. In practice, NOE data are converted into an interval restraint with an empirical upper distance bound $r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}}$ and a lower distance bound $r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}}$, reflecting uncertainties due to calibration, dynamics, and spin diffusion. A realistic integrative modeling energy penalizes deviations that fall outside these bounds while applying no penalty when the modeled distance lies within the bounds, and the penalty strength should reflect the confidence in each restraint through weights.\n\nStarting from these principles and assuming a Gaussian error model for distance deviations outside the bounds, formulate a restraint energy for a set of NOE-derived distance intervals that (i) imposes zero penalty when $r_{ij}$ satisfies $r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}} \\le r_{ij} \\le r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}}$, (ii) applies a quadratic penalty for distances above the upper bound with a weight $w_{ij}$, and (iii) applies a quadratic penalty for distances below the lower bound with a weight $w'_{ij}$. Then, re-express this piecewise function compactly using the $\\max$ operator. Finally, for the following three proton pairs in a peptide fragment, compute the total NOE restraint energy.\n\nUse the Euclidean distance $r_{ij}=\\|\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{r}_j\\|$ with coordinates in Angstroms (Å). Bounds are in Angstroms, and weights are in kilojoules per mole per square Angstrom ($\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} \\text{Å}^{-2}$), so that the energy is reported in kilojoules per mole ($\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$).\n\n- Pair $1$–$2$: $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0.0,\\,0.0,\\,0.0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_2=(2.5,\\,0.0,\\,0.0)$, $r_{12}^{\\text{upper}}=3.0$, $r_{12}^{\\text{lower}}=1.8$, $w_{12}=12.0$, $w'_{12}=12.0$.\n- Pair $3$–$4$: $\\mathbf{r}_3=(0.0,\\,0.0,\\,0.0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_4=(4.5,\\,1.5,\\,0.0)$, $r_{34}^{\\text{upper}}=4.0$, $r_{34}^{\\text{lower}}=2.0$, $w_{34}=8.0$, $w'_{34}=2.0$.\n- Pair $5$–$6$: $\\mathbf{r}_5=(0.0,\\,0.0,\\,0.0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_6=(1.2,\\,0.8,\\,0.0)$, $r_{56}^{\\text{upper}}=3.5$, $r_{56}^{\\text{lower}}=1.8$, $w_{56}=1.0$, $w'_{56}=6.0$.\n\nIn addition to the derivation, briefly justify the qualitative choice of distinct weights $w_{ij}$ and $w'_{ij}$ based on uncertainty and integrative balancing with cryo-EM and SAXS terms.\n\nRound your final numeric energy to four significant figures and express it in $\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically sound, and well-posed. It describes a standard method for implementing distance restraints in integrative structural modeling, a key technique in computational chemical biology. All necessary data are provided to formulate the energy function and compute a unique numerical answer. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe task is to first formulate a restraint energy function, $E_{ij}$, for a pair of atoms $i$ and $j$ based on a Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) derived distance interval, $[r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}}, r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}}]$. The model distance between the atoms is $r_{ij}$. The energy function must satisfy three conditions:\n(i) A zero penalty when the distance is within the allowed interval: $E_{ij} = 0$ for $r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}} \\le r_{ij} \\le r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}}$.\n(ii) A quadratic penalty when the distance exceeds the upper bound: $E_{ij} = w_{ij} (r_{ij} - r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}})^2$ for $r_{ij} > r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}}$, where $w_{ij}$ is a weight factor.\n(iii) A quadratic penalty when the distance is less than the lower bound: $E_{ij} = w'_{ij} (r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}} - r_{ij})^2$ for $r_{ij} < r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}}$, where $w'_{ij}$ is a separate weight factor.\n\nThese conditions define a piecewise function for the restraint energy $E_{ij}$ as a function of the model distance $r_{ij}$:\n$$\nE_{ij}(r_{ij}) = \\begin{cases}\nw'_{ij} (r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}} - r_{ij})^2 & \\text{if } r_{ij} < r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}} \\le r_{ij} \\le r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}} \\\\\nw_{ij} (r_{ij} - r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}})^2 & \\text{if } r_{ij} > r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis function is continuous and differentiable (with a derivative of $0$ within the allowed region).\n\nTo express this compactly using the $\\max$ operator, we can analyze the terms for the penalties. The deviation above the upper bound, $(r_{ij} - r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}})$, is positive only if $r_{ij} > r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}}$; otherwise, it is zero or negative. We can isolate the positive deviation using $\\max(0, r_{ij} - r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}})$. Similarly, the deviation below the lower bound, $(r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}} - r_{ij})$, is positive only if $r_{ij} < r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}}$. This positive deviation can be written as $\\max(0, r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}} - r_{ij})$. Since a distance $r_{ij}$ cannot simultaneously be greater than $r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}}$ and less than $r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}}$ (as $r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}} \\le r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}}$), we can sum the two penalty terms. If $r_{ij}$ is within the bounds, both $\\max$ functions will evaluate to $0$, yielding an energy of $0$. The resulting compact expression is:\n$$\nE_{ij}(r_{ij}) = w_{ij} [\\max(0, r_{ij} - r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}})]^2 + w'_{ij} [\\max(0, r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}} - r_{ij})]^2\n$$\n\nThe use of distinct weights, $w_{ij}$ and $w'_{ij}$, is physically and methodologically justified. The lower bound, $r_{ij}^{\\text{lower}}$, often corresponds to the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two atoms, representing a steric limit. A violation of this bound implies a physically highly unfavorable atomic clash. Consequently, a large weight $w'_{ij}$ is typically used to impose a strong penalty. The upper bound, $r_{ij}^{\\text{upper}}$, is derived from the NOE intensity, which decays as $r_{ij}^{-6}$. This bound can be uncertain due to factors like molecular motion, spin diffusion (indirect magnetization transfer), and experimental calibration. A weaker NOE signal may imply a long distance, but it is a less definitive constraint than a steric clash. Therefore, a smaller weight $w_{ij}$ is often assigned to the upper bound, making it a \"softer\" restraint. Furthermore, in integrative modeling, these weights are crucial for balancing the contributions of different data types (e.g., NMR, cryo-EM, SAXS) to the overall scoring function, reflecting the relative confidence in each piece of experimental evidence.\n\nWe now compute the total restraint energy, $E_{\\text{total}} = E_{12} + E_{34} + E_{56}$, for the three given proton pairs. All distances and coordinates are in Angstroms (Å), and weights are in $\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} \\text{Å}^{-2}$.\n\nFor Pair $1$–$2$:\nThe coordinates are $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0.0,\\,0.0,\\,0.0)$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2=(2.5,\\,0.0,\\,0.0)$. The distance is:\n$$\nr_{12} = \\sqrt{(2.5 - 0.0)^2 + (0.0 - 0.0)^2 + (0.0 - 0.0)^2} = \\sqrt{2.5^2} = 2.5 \\, \\text{Å}\n$$\nThe bounds are $r_{12}^{\\text{lower}}=1.8$ Å and $r_{12}^{\\text{upper}}=3.0$ Å.\nSince $1.8 \\le 2.5 \\le 3.0$, the distance lies within the allowed interval.

The distance is:\n$$\nr_{34} = \\sqrt{(4.5 - 0.0)^2 + (1.5 - 0.0)^2 + (0.0 - 0.0)^2} = \\sqrt{4.5^2 + 1.5^2} = \\sqrt{20.25 + 2.25} = \\sqrt{22.5} \\, \\text{Å}\n$$\nThe numerical value is $r_{34} \\approx 4.7434$ Å.

The distance is:\n$$\nr_{56} = \\sqrt{(1.2 - 0.0)^2 + (0.8 - 0.0)^2 + (0.0 - 0.0)^2} = \\sqrt{1.2^2 + 0.8^2} = \\sqrt{1.44 + 0.64} = \\sqrt{2.08} \\, \\text{Å}\n$$\nThe numerical value is $r_{56} \\approx 1.4422$ Å. The bounds are $r_{56}^{\\text{lower}}=1.8$ Å and $r_{56}^{\\text{upper}}=3.5$ Å.\nSince $r_{56} \\approx 1.4422 < 1.8$, the distance violates the lower bound.

Note that $(\\tfrac{3}{5}) = 0.6$ and $(\\tfrac{4}{5}) = 0.8$.\n\n-   $D^{\\mathrm{pred}}_1 = (6.0)(0.6^2) + (-4.0)(0.8^2) + (-2.0)(0^2) = (6.0)(0.36) - (4.0)(0.64) = 2.16 - 2.56 = -0.40 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n-   $D^{\\mathrm{pred}}_2 = (6.0)(0.8^2) + (-4.0)(0^2) + (-2.0)(0.6^2) = (6.0)(0.64) - (2.0)(0.36) = 3.84 - 0.72 = 3.12 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n-   $D^{\\mathrm{pred}}_3 = (6.0)(0^2) + (-4.0)(0.8^2) + (-2.0)(0.6^2) = -(4.0)(0.64) - (2.0)(0.36) = -2.56 - 0.72 = -3.28 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n-   $D^{\\mathrm{pred}}_4 = (6.0)(0.6^2) + (-4.0)(0^2) + (-2.0)(0.8^2) = (6.0)(0.36) - (2.0)(0.64) = 2.16 - 1.28 = 0.88 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n-   $D^{\\mathrm{pred}}_5 = (6.0)(0^2) + (-4.0)(0.6^2) + (-2.0)(0.8^2) = -(4.0)(0.36) - (2.0)(0.64) = -1.44 - 1.28 = -2.72 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n-   $D^{\\mathrm{pred}}_6 = (6.0)(0.8^2) + (-4.0)(0.6^2) + (-2.0)(0^2) = (6.0)(0.64) - (4.0)(0.36) = 3.84 - 1.44 = 2.40 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nNow, we compute the initial residuals, $r_i = D^{\\mathrm{exp}}_i - D^{\\mathrm{pred}}_i$.\n\n-   $r_1 = -0.40 - (-0.40) = 0.00 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$. (Perfect match)\n-   $r_2 = 2.40 - 3.12 = -0.72 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$. (Mismatch)\n-   $r_3 = -3.28 - (-3.28) = 0.00 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$. (Perfect match)\n-   $r_4 = 0.88 - 0.88 = 0.00 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.

(Mismatch)\n\nThe pattern of discrepancy is highly specific: four out of six RDCs are predicted perfectly, while the predictions for indices $2$ and $6$ are incorrect. However, we note that $D^{\\mathrm{pred}}_2 = 3.12 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$, which is equal to $D^{\\mathrm{exp}}_6$, and $D^{\\mathrm{pred}}_6 = 2.40 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$, which is equal to $D^{\\mathrm{exp}}_2$. This strongly suggests a misassignment of the experimental RDCs for vectors $2$ and $6$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. Swap the assignments of the RDCs for indices $2$ and $6$ (a reindexing of two bond vectors).**\n\n    This hypothesis suggests that the correct experimental data mapping is $D'^{\\mathrm{exp}}_2 = D^{\\mathrm{exp}}_6 = 3.12 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $D'^{\\mathrm{exp}}_6 = D^{\\mathrm{exp}}_2 = 2.40 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$. We compute the new residuals based on this swap, keeping the predictions $D^{\\mathrm{pred}}_i$ unchanged.\n    -   $r'_1 = 0.00 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    -   $r'_2 = D'^{\\mathrm{exp}}_2 - D^{\\mathrm{pred}}_2 = 3.12 - 3.12 = 0.00 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    -   $r'_3 = 0.00 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    -   $r'_4 = 0.00 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    -   $r'_5 = 0.00 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    -   $r'_6 = D'^{\\mathrm{exp}}_6 - D^{\\mathrm{pred}}_6 = 2.40 - 2.40 = 0.00 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    \n    This simple swap results in a perfect agreement for all six RDCs, with all residuals becoming zero. This is a common error in spectral assignment and provides a complete and parsimonious explanation for the observed pattern.\n\n    **Verdict: Correct**\n\n-   **B. Apply a rotation of $90^\\circ$ about the laboratory $z$-axis to the alignment tensor...**\n\n    This is equivalent to permuting the $x$ and $y$ axes of $\\mathbf{S}$. The new tensor would be $\\mathbf{S'} = \\mathrm{diag}(S_{yy}, S_{xx}, S_{zz}) = \\mathrm{diag}(-4.0, 6.0, -2.0)$. This changes the predicted RDCs. For instance, for $\\mathbf{u}_1$:\n    $D'^{\\mathrm{pred}}_1 = (-4.0)(0.6^2) + (6.0)(0.8^2) + (-2.0)(0^2) = -1.44 + 3.84 = 2.40 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    The experimental value is $D^{\\mathrm{exp}}_1 = -0.40 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$. The original prediction was perfect ($D^{\\mathrm{pred}}_1 = -0.40 \\;\\mathrm{Hz}$). This hypothesis introduces a large error where there was none. It fails to fix the existing problem and creates new ones.\n\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n-   **C. Invert all bond vectors as $\\mathbf{u}_i \\mapsto -\\mathbf{u}_i$ to correct potential direction misassignments.**\n\n    The RDC is calculated from a quadratic form: $D_i = \\mathbf{u}_i^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{u}_i$. If we replace $\\mathbf{u}_i$ with $-\\mathbf{u}_i$, the new predicted RDC becomes:\n    $D'_i = (-\\mathbf{u}_i)^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{S} (-\\mathbf{u}_i) = (-1)^2 (\\mathbf{u}_i^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{u}_i) = 1 \\times D_i = D_i$.\n    The predicted RDC is invariant to the inversion of the bond vector.

            "introduction": "A central challenge in integrative modeling is to create a balanced scoring function that properly combines information from different sources, such as physics-based energy terms and diverse experimental datasets. If one term dominates, the resulting model may satisfy one piece of information while violating others. This practice  explores a principled heuristic for setting the relative weight between a molecular geometry prior and a Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) data term. By calculating and matching the curvature of the respective energy landscapes, you will determine a weight that ensures both sources of information contribute meaningfully to the structural refinement process.",
