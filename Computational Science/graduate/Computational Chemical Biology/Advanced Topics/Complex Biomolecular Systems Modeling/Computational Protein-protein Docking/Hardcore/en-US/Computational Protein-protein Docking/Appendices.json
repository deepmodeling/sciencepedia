Energy Minimization Analysis**\n\nThis step applies to the state found after repacking: rotamers P1-Q1: $(1,1)$ and P2-Q2: $(2,2)$.

The second part describes a robust, multi-pronged convergence criterion that is standard in the field. It requires stability in energy ($\\lvert \\Delta E \\rvert$), structure (contact map Jaccard index $J=1$ for two cycles), and achieving a local energy minimum (low gradient norm). This is a comprehensive and scientifically sound set of criteria.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. After repacking, the contacts are unchanged relative to the initial state because pairwise energies cannot overcome self-energies; minimization introduces a new P1–Q2 contact.**\nThe first claim, \"contacts are unchanged,\" is incorrect; P2-Q2 becomes a contact. The reasoning is also incorrect; the favorable pairwise energies did overcome the less favorable self-energies. The second claim, \"minimization introduces a new P1–Q2 contact,\" is incorrect as minimization does not change the contact set in this model, and P1-Q2 interactions are negligible. The convergence criterion based only on a loose energy threshold ($\\lvert \\Delta E \\rvert  1.0 \\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$) is inadequate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. After repacking, P1–Q1 contact is lost due to repulsive relaxation, but P2–Q2 remains non-contact; after minimization, both pairs become contacts.**\nThe claim \"P1–Q1 contact is lost\" is incorrect. The claim \"P2–Q2 remains non-contact\" is incorrect. The claim \"after minimization, both pairs become contacts\" is incorrect as they were already contacts after repacking. The RMSD-based convergence criterion is too loose ($2.0 \\,\\text{\\AA}$) and improperly ignores energy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. After repacking, P1–Q1 switches to a non-contact geometry while P2–Q2 remains non-contact; after minimization, P2–Q2 becomes the only contact.**\nBoth claims about the post-repacking state are incorrect. The claim about the post-minimization contact set is incorrect. The convergence criterion based only on hydrogen bonds is far too simplistic and ignores other crucial energy terms and the overall structural stability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nThe only option that aligns with the calculations and presents a scientifically rigorous set of principles is A.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It presents a well-defined task in assessing binary classifiers using standard metrics, grounded in the foundational principles of statistics and machine learning. All data and definitions are provided, the problem is self-contained, and the objectives are clear and formalizable.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n- **Scoring Function**: A real-valued function $s$ assigns a score to each protein-protein pose. Higher scores indicate a stronger belief of being near-native.\n- **Labels**: A binary label $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is provided for each pose, where $y=1$ for near-native and $y=0$ for decoy.\n- **Classification Rule**: For a threshold $t$, the predicted class $\\hat{y}$ is $1$ if $s \\ge t$, and $0$ otherwise.\n- **Counts**: For a threshold $t$, the counts are defined as true positives $\\mathrm{TP}(t)$, false positives $\\mathrm{FP}(t)$, true negatives $\\mathrm{TN}(t)$, and false negatives $\\mathrm{FN}(t)$.\n- **Dataset Totals**: $P = \\sum_i y_i$ is the total number of positives, and $N = \\sum_i (1 - y_i)$ is the total number of negatives. It is given that $P \\ge 1$ and $N \\ge 1$.\n- **Metric Definitions**:\n    - True Positive Rate (TPR) / Recall: $\\mathrm{TPR}(t) = \\mathrm{Recall}(t) = \\mathrm{TP}(t)/P$.\n    - False Positive Rate (FPR): $\\mathrm{FPR}(t) = \\mathrm{FP}(t)/N$.\n    - Precision: $\\mathrm{Precision}(t) = \\mathrm{TP}(t)/(\\mathrm{TP}(t)+\\mathrm{FP}(t))$, with the convention that Precision is $1$ if the denominator is $0$.\n- **Curve Definitions**:\n    - ROC Curve: The set of points $(\\mathrm{FPR}(t), \\mathrm{TPR}(t))$ as $t$ sweeps from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$. It must include the endpoints $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$.\n    - PR Curve: The set of points $(\\mathrm{Recall}(t), \\mathrm{Precision}(t))$ over the same sweep. It must include the endpoints $(0,1)$ and a final point corresponding to classifying all samples as positive.\n- **Area Under Curve (AUC) Calculation**: The area is defined by discrete trapezoidal integration: for an ordered sequence of points $(x_k, y_k)$, the area is $\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\frac{(x_{k+1}-x_k)}{2}\\,(y_{k+1}+y_k)$.\n- **Test Suite**: Five distinct test cases are provided, each with a list of scores and corresponding labels.\n- **Output Requirement**: For each test case, compute ROC-AUC and PR-AUC, rounded to $6$ decimal places, and output them in a flattened, comma-separated list.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The definitions of TP, FP, TPR, FPR, Precision, Recall, ROC curves, and PR curves are standard and fundamental in statistics and machine learning for evaluating binary classifiers.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly structured. The inputs (scores, labels) are defined, and the desired outputs (ROC-AUC, PR-AUC) are unambiguously specified. The method of calculation (trapezoidal rule) is explicitly given, ensuring a unique solution exists for each test case.\n- **Objective**: The problem uses precise mathematical and algorithmic definitions, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n- **Completeness**: The problem provides all necessary data and definitions. The constraints $P \\ge 1$ and $N \\ge 1$ prevent division-by-zero errors in the definitions of TPR and FPR.\n- **Feasibility**: The datasets are small and computationally tractable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Algorithmic Design\n\nThe core of the problem is to construct the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves from a set of scored and labeled data points and then to calculate the area under these curves.\n\n**1. Curve Construction Strategy**\n\nThe curves are defined by varying a score threshold $t$ from $+\\infty$ down to $-\\infty$. As the threshold $t$ is lowered, more samples are classified as positive. The values of True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), Precision, and Recall only change when the threshold $t$ crosses one of the score values present in the data. Therefore, we can construct the curves by considering the unique score values as the thresholds.\n\nThe most effective algorithm involves the following steps:\n- Combine the scores $s_i$ and labels $y_i$ into pairs $(s_i, y_i)$.\n- Sort these pairs in descending order based on the score $s_i$. In case of tied scores, the relative order of labels does not affect the final curve, as all samples with the same score are processed as a single group.\n- Pre-calculate the total number of positive instances, $P = \\sum y_i$, and negative instances, $N = \\sum (1-y_i)$.\n- Initialize the counts of true positives ($\\mathrm{TP}$) and false positives ($\\mathrm{FP}$) to $0$.\n- The ROC curve begins at the point $(0,0)$, which corresponds to a threshold $t$ higher than all scores. At this threshold, $\\mathrm{TP}=0$ and $\\mathrm{FP}=0$, so $\\mathrm{FPR} = 0/N = 0$ and $\\mathrm{TPR} = 0/P = 0$.\n- The PR curve begins at the point $(0,1)$. At the highest threshold, $\\mathrm{Recall} = \\mathrm{TP}/P = 0$. The denominator of Precision, $\\mathrm{TP}+\\mathrm{FP}$, is $0$. By the given convention, Precision is $1$.\n\n**2. Iterative Point Generation**\n\nWe iterate through the sorted data. To handle tied scores correctly, we process all data points with the same score value simultaneously.\nLet the sorted unique scores be $t_1  t_2  \\dots  t_m$.\n- For each unique score $t_j$:\n    - Identify all samples $(s_i, y_i)$ where $s_i = t_j$.\n    - Count the number of positives ($\\Delta \\mathrm{TP}$) and negatives ($\\Delta \\mathrm{FP}$) among these samples.\n    - Update the cumulative counts: $\\mathrm{TP} \\leftarrow \\mathrm{TP} + \\Delta \\mathrm{TP}$ and $\\mathrm{FP} \\leftarrow \\mathrm{FP} + \\Delta \\mathrm{FP}$.\n    - After updating the counts, a new point on each curve is generated:\n        - **ROC point**: $(\\mathrm{FPR}, \\mathrm{TPR}) = (\\mathrm{FP}/N, \\mathrm{TP}/P)$.\n        - **PR point**: $(\\mathrm{Recall}, \\mathrm{Precision}) = (\\mathrm{TP}/P, \\mathrm{TP}/(\\mathrm{TP}+\\mathrm{FP}))$.\n\nThis process generates a sequence of points for each curve. The final point is generated after processing all samples, where $\\mathrm{TP}=P$ and $\\mathrm{FP}=N$, resulting in the ROC point $(1,1)$ and the PR point $(1, P/(P+N))$.\n\n**3. Area Calculation**\n\nThe area under the curve is calculated using the trapezoidal rule as specified. For a curve defined by an ordered sequence of points $(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), \\dots, (x_K, y_K)$, where the $x$-coordinates are non-decreasing, the area is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Area} = \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\frac{(x_{k+1}-x_k)}{2}\\,(y_k + y_{k+1})\n$$\nThis formula is applied to the sequence of points generated for the ROC curve and the PR curve, respectively. For the ROC curve, $x_k = \\mathrm{FPR}_k$ and $y_k = \\mathrm{TPR}_k$. For the PR curve, $x_k = \\mathrm{Recall}_k$ and $y_k = \\mathrm{Precision}_k$. This calculation yields the ROC-AUC and PR-AUC.\n\nThis complete methodology, from sorting to point generation to area integration, provides a robust and correct way to solve the problem for the given test cases.",
