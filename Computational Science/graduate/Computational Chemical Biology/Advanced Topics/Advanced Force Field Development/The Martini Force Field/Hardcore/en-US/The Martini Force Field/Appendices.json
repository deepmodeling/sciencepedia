            "problem": "A small, protonated amphiphilic molecule, $2$-(dimethylamino)ethanol, is to be coarse-grained using the MARTINI force field for coarse-grained (CG) molecular simulations.

Bead Assignment and Justification\n\nThe molecule is protonated $2$-(dimethylamino)ethanol, with the chemical structure $(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2\\mathrm{N}^+\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{CH}_2-\\mathrm{CH}_2-\\mathrm{OH}$. We first count the number of heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms to determine the number of coarse-grained (CG) beads. The molecule contains one nitrogen atom (N), four carbon atoms (C), and one oxygen atom (O), for a total of $6$ heavy atoms.\n\nGiven the MARTINI rule of approximately $3$–$4$ heavy atoms per bead, a $2$-bead representation is the most appropriate, partitioning the molecule into two groups of $3$ heavy atoms each. A chemically intuitive partition separates the charged amino group from the polar hydroxyl group.\n\n- **Bead 1 (Head Group):** We define the first bead to encompass the protonated dimethylammonium group, $(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2\\mathrm{N}^+\\mathrm{H}-$. This fragment consists of one nitrogen and two carbon atoms, totaling $3$ heavy atoms. This group carries the net formal charge of $+1$ and, due to the proton on the nitrogen, acts as a hydrogen bond donor. The problem states the molecule has a net charge of $+1$ and a hydrogen bond donor count of $1$, which are fully localized to this group. In the MARTINI classification, a bead representing a charged group is designated as type $\\mathrm{Q}$. Therefore, this bead is assigned the class **$\\mathrm{Q}$**.\n\n- **Bead 2 (Tail Group):** The second bead represents the remainder of the molecule, the hydroxyethyl tail, $-\\mathrm{CH}_2-\\mathrm{CH}_2-\\mathrm{OH}$. This fragment consists of two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, also totaling $3$ heavy atoms. While this group is electrically neutral, the terminal hydroxyl group ($-\\mathrm{OH}$) is highly polar and can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor via the oxygen lone pairs. The problem states a hydrogen bond acceptor count of $1$ for the whole molecule, which is localized to this group. A bead representing a neutral but polar group is designated as type $\\mathrm{P}$. Therefore, this bead is assigned the class **$\\mathrm{P}$**.\n\nThis $2$-bead model ($\\mathrm{Q}-\\mathrm{P}$) is consistent with all the provided descriptors and the mapping rules of the MARTINI force field.\n\n#### 2. Derivation of the Lennard-Jones Potential Minimum\n\nThe Lennard-Jones potential is given by:\n$$\nU(r) = 4 \\epsilon \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{r} \\right)^{12} - \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{r} \\right)^6 \\right]\n$$\nTo find the location of the potential minimum, $r_{\\text{min}}$, we must find the root of the first derivative of the potential with respect to the distance $r$.\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dr} = 4 \\epsilon \\left[ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{r^{12}} \\right) - \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{r^{6}} \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dr} = 4 \\epsilon \\left[ \\sigma^{12} (-12 r^{-13}) - \\sigma^{6} (-6 r^{-7}) \\right] = 4 \\epsilon \\left[ -\\frac{12 \\sigma^{12}}{r^{13}} + \\frac{6 \\sigma^{6}}{r^{7}} \\right]\n$$\nSet $\\frac{dU}{dr} = 0$ to find the extremum:\n$$\n-\\frac{12 \\sigma^{12}}{r^{13}} + \\frac{6 \\sigma^{6}}{r^{7}} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{6 \\sigma^{6}}{r^{7}} = \\frac{12 \\sigma^{12}}{r^{13}}\n$$\nAssuming $r \\neq 0$ and $\\sigma \\neq 0$, we can simplify:\n$$\nr^6 = \\frac{12 \\sigma^{12}}{6 \\sigma^{6}} = 2 \\sigma^6\n$$\nThe location of the minimum is therefore:\n$$\nr_{\\text{min}} = (2 \\sigma^6)^{1/6} = 2^{1/6} \\sigma\n$$\nNow, we substitute $r_{\\text{min}}$ back into the potential function $U(r)$ to find the value of the potential at the minimum, $U_{\\text{min}}$.\n$$\nU_{\\text{min}} = U(r_{\\text{min}}) = 4 \\epsilon \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{2^{1/6} \\sigma} \\right)^{12} - \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{2^{1/6} \\sigma} \\right)^6 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\text{min}} = 4 \\epsilon \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{2^{1/6}} \\right)^{12} - \\left( \\frac{1}{2^{1/6}} \\right)^6 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\text{min}} = 4 \\epsilon \\left[ \\frac{1}{2^{(12/6)}} - \\frac{1}{2^{(6/6)}} \\right] = 4 \\epsilon \\left[ \\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{2^1} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\text{min}} = 4 \\epsilon \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right] = 4 \\epsilon \\left[ -\\frac{1}{4} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\text{min}} = -\\epsilon\n$$\nThe potential minimum for any pairwise LJ interaction occurs at $r_{\\text{min}} = 2^{1/6} \\sigma$ and has a value of $-\\epsilon$.\n\n#### 3. Total Minimum Interaction Energy with Water\n\nThe problem states that the total minimum solute–water interaction energy, $U_{\\text{total, min}}$, is the sum of the pairwise minima for each of the assigned solute beads interacting with a water bead (W). From Part 1, our molecule is modeled by one $\\mathrm{Q}$ bead and one $\\mathrm{P}$ bead.\n$$\nU_{\\text{total, min}} = U_{\\text{min}}(\\mathrm{Q-W}) + U_{\\text{min}}(\\mathrm{P-W})\n$$\nFrom the result derived in Part 2, the minimum interaction energy for any given pair is equal to the negative of its corresponding well depth parameter, $-\\epsilon$.\n$$\nU_{\\text{total, min}} = (-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{QW}}) + (-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{PW}}) = -(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{QW}} + \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{PW}})\n$$\nWe are given the values for the interaction parameters with water:\n- $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{QW}} = 6.0\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$\n- $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{PW}} = 5.0\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression:\n$$\nU_{\\text{total, min}} = -(6.0\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1} + 5.0\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\text{total, min}} = -11.0\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nU_{\\text{total, min}} = -11.00\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the constant spacing $\\Delta g$ in a linear model for the transfer free energy of a homologous series of compounds. The solution involves relating the experimental octanol/water partition coefficients to the standard Gibbs free energy of transfer and then fitting this to the provided coarse-grained model.\n\nFirst, the standard Gibbs free energy of transfer from water to octanol, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{transfer}}$, is related to the octanol/water partition coefficient, $P$, by the fundamental thermodynamic equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{transfer}} = -RT \\ln P\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The problem provides partition coefficients in terms of their base-$10$ logarithm, $\\log_{10}P$.

The MARTINI force field, due to its smoothed potential energy landscape, significantly accelerates dynamics, which manifests as a lower effective viscosity $\\eta_{\\text{CG}}$ and a higher diffusion coefficient $D_{\\text{CG}}$ compared to the atomistic reference. The scaling factor $s > 1$ corrects for this artificial speed-up, mapping the compressed CG time back to a physically meaningful atomistic time scale.\n\nThe validity of this mapping is conditional. It is expected to hold for long-time diffusive phenomena. However, it is expected to fail for:\n1.  **Barrier-crossing events**: Processes like protein conformational changes or chemical reactions involve overcoming specific energy barriers. The speed-up for such events depends on the ratio of the barrier heights in the CG and AT potential energy landscapes, which generally does not equate to the viscosity ratio.\n2.  **Short-time dynamics**: At very short time scales, motion is ballistic rather than diffusive. The linear MSD-time relationship does not hold, and thus this scaling approach is invalid.\n3.  **Heterogeneous systems**: In a complex, multicomponent system (e.g., within a cell or a complex membrane), the local viscosity can vary significantly. A single, global scaling factor becomes a crude approximation.\nEmpirically, for the standard MARTINI water model, a general scaling factor of $s=4$ is often recommended as a rule of thumb, representing an average over various properties. The viscosity-based approach used here is more specific and typically more accurate for diffusion calculations.\n\nNow, we compute the implied atomistic trajectory time $T_{\\text{AT}}$. We are given:\n$\\eta_{\\text{AT}} = 0.690\\ \\mathrm{mPa\\cdot s}$\n$\\eta_{\\text{CG}} = 0.244\\ \\mathrm{mPa\\cdot s}$\n$T_{\\text{CG}} = 50.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless scaling factor $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\eta_{\\text{AT}}}{\\eta_{\\text{CG}}} = \\frac{0.690}{0.244}\n$$\nNext, we use this factor to find the equivalent atomistic time $T_{\\text{AT}}$:\n$$\nT_{\\text{AT}} = s \\cdot T_{\\text{CG}} = \\left( \\frac{0.690}{0.244} \\right) \\cdot 50.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\text{AT}} \\approx 2.82786885 \\times 50.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s} \\approx 141.39344\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nT_{\\text{AT}} \\approx 141.4\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}\n$$\nThe variables $D_{\\text{CG}}$, $R$, and $T$ provided in the problem statement were used to establish the context and internal consistency of the problem but are not required for the final calculation, which depends only on the viscosities and the CG simulation time.",
