The mathematical function for concentration decay is correct for this model. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters ($C_0$, $k$, Dose) to uniquely determine the requested quantities ($\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty}$, $\\mathrm{CL}$). The provided values are consistent and physically realistic. For instance, the implicit volume of distribution, $V_d = \\text{Dose} / C_0 = 100 \\text{ mg} / 10 \\text{ mg/L} = 10 \\text{ L}$, is a reasonable value for a drug. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by deriving expressions for the area under the concentration-time curve ($\\mathrm{AUC}$) and systemic clearance ($\\mathrm{CL}$) from their fundamental definitions.\n\n**1. Derivation and Computation of $\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty}$**\n\nThe total area under the concentration-time curve from time $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$, denoted $\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty}$, represents the total exposure to the drug. It is calculated by integrating the plasma concentration function $C(t)$ over this interval.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t) \\,dt\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given function $C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k t)$:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C_0 \\exp(-k t) \\,dt\n$$\n\nSince $C_0$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the integral:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} = C_0 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-k t) \\,dt\n$$\n\nThe integral of the exponential function is:\n\n$$\n\\int \\exp(-k t) \\,dt = -\\frac{1}{k} \\exp(-k t)\n$$\n\nEvaluating the definite integral from $0$ to $\\infty$:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} = C_0 \\left[ -\\frac{1}{k} \\exp(-k t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = C_0 \\left( \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{k} \\exp(-k t)\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{k} \\exp(-k \\cdot 0)\\right) \\right)\n$$\n\nSince the elimination rate constant $k$ is positive ($k=0.2$ h$^{-1}  0$), the term $\\exp(-k t)$ approaches $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$. The expression simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} = C_0 \\left( 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{k} \\cdot 1\\right) \\right) = \\frac{C_0}{k}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $C_0 = 10$ mg/L and $k = 0.2$ h$^{-1}$.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} = \\frac{10 \\text{ mg/L}}{0.2 \\text{ h}^{-1}} = 50 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}\n$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures gives $50.00$ mg$\\cdot$h/L.\n\n**2. Derivation and Computation of Systemic Clearance ($\\mathrm{CL}$)**\n\nSystemic clearance ($\\mathrm{CL}$) is a fundamental pharmacokinetic parameter that describes the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time. It relates the rate of elimination to the plasma concentration. For linear, first-order kinetics, a key relationship derived from mass balance connects the administered dose, clearance, and total exposure.\n\nThe total amount of drug eliminated from the body over all time must equal the bioavailable dose. For an intravenous bolus, the entire dose is bioavailable. The instantaneous rate of elimination is given by $\\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C(t)$. Integrating this rate from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$ gives the total amount eliminated:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total amount eliminated} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (\\text{Rate of elimination}) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C(t) \\,dt\n$$\n\nSince $\\mathrm{CL}$ is a constant under linear kinetics:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total amount eliminated} = \\mathrm{CL} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t) \\,dt = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty}\n$$\n\nEquating the total amount eliminated to the administered dose:\n\n$$\n\\text{Dose} = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty}\n$$\n\nRearranging this equation yields the expression for clearance:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CL} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty}}\n$$\n\nWe are given the Dose $= 100$ mg and have just calculated $\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} = 50$ mg$\\cdot$h/L.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CL} = \\frac{100 \\text{ mg}}{50 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}} = 2 \\text{ L/h}\n$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures gives $2.000$ L/h.\n\nIn summary, the total area under the curve is $\\mathrm{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} = 50.00$ mg$\\cdot$h/L and the systemic clearance is $\\mathrm{CL} = 2.000$ L/h.",

            "problem": "A drug is being modeled within Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicology (ADMET) property prediction using a one-compartment oral pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination. The governing mass-balance Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are: the amount in the gastrointestinal tract $A_{\\mathrm{g}}(t)$ satisfies $\\dfrac{dA_{\\mathrm{g}}}{dt}=-k_{\\mathrm{a}}A_{\\mathrm{g}}(t)$, and the amount in the central compartment $A_{\\mathrm{c}}(t)$ satisfies $\\dfrac{dA_{\\mathrm{c}}}{dt}=k_{\\mathrm{a}}A_{\\mathrm{g}}(t)-k_{\\mathrm{e}}A_{\\mathrm{c}}(t)$, with concentration $C(t)=A_{\\mathrm{c}}(t)/V$. A single oral dose $D$ is administered at $t=0$ with absolute bioavailability $F$, so $A_{\\mathrm{g}}(0)=F D$ and $A_{\\mathrm{c}}(0)=0$.

Using only oral data, reason from the ODEs and core pharmacokinetic definitions to determine the qualitative and quantitative consequences of this modeling choice on the inferred elimination rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$ and on downstream parameter estimates such as the apparent clearance over bioavailability $CL/F$ and the apparent volume of distribution over bioavailability $V/F$. Which option best describes the outcome?\n\nA. The inferred elimination rate constant $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}$ equals the observed terminal slope and therefore $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}=k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}$, causing underestimation of the true $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$.

The apparent terminal half-life equals the absorption half-life and not the elimination half-life.\n\nB. The inferred elimination rate constant $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}$ equals the true $k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}$ because $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is independent of $k_{\\mathrm{a}}$ when fitting oral data, so there is no bias in $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$ or $V/F$.

This is a canonical model in pharmacokinetics, a discipline within computational chemical biology and pharmacology. The concept of \"flip-flop kinetics\", where the absorption rate is slower than the elimination rate ($k_{\\mathrm{a}}  k_{\\mathrm{e}}$), is a well-established and critically important phenomenon in the field. The provided ODEs correctly describe the mass balance of the system. The parameter values are scientifically realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete set of ODEs, initial conditions, and parameters, which defines a unique solution for the concentration profile $C(t)$. The question is precisely formulated, asking for the analytical consequences of a specific, common modeling error. The existence of a unique, meaningful analysis is guaranteed.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity. It describes a hypothetical but realistic modeling scenario.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It presents a classic scenario from pharmacokinetics that tests a fundamental understanding of kinetic models. The premises are consistent and sufficient for a rigorous analysis.\n**Verdict: The problem is valid.**\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the consequences of misinterpreting the terminal-phase rate constant in a case of flip-flop kinetics.\n\n**1. General Solution of the ODEs**\n\nFirst, we solve the system of ODEs. The equation for the amount in the GI tract is:\n$$ \\dfrac{dA_{\\mathrm{g}}}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{a}} A_{\\mathrm{g}}(t) \\quad \\text{with } A_{\\mathrm{g}}(0) = F D $$\nThis is a simple exponential decay, with the solution:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{g}}(t) = F D e^{-k_{\\mathrm{a}} t} $$\nSubstituting this into the second ODE for the amount in the central compartment:\n$$ \\dfrac{dA_{\\mathrm{c}}}{dt} + k_{\\mathrm{e}} A_{\\mathrm{c}}(t) = k_{\\mathrm{a}} A_{\\mathrm{g}}(t) = k_{\\mathrm{a}} F D e^{-k_{\\mathrm{a}} t} $$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous ODE. Assuming $k_{\\mathrm{a}} \\neq k_{\\mathrm{e}}$, the solution with the initial condition $A_{\\mathrm{c}}(0)=0$ is the well-known Bateman function:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{c}}(t) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{a}} F D}{k_{\\mathrm{e}}-k_{\\mathrm{a}}} (e^{-k_{\\mathrm{a}} t} - e^{-k_{\\mathrm{e}} t}) $$\nThe concentration in the central compartment is therefore:\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{c}}(t)}{V} = \\frac{F D k_{\\mathrm{a}}}{V(k_{\\mathrm{e}}-k_{\\mathrm{a}})} (e^{-k_{\\mathrm{a}} t} - e^{-k_{\\mathrm{e}} t}) $$\n\n**2. Analysis of the Terminal Phase**\n\nThe behavior of $C(t)$ at large times ($t \\to \\infty$) is governed by the slower of the two exponential decay processes, i.e., the one with the smaller rate constant. Let's denote the terminal-phase rate constant as $\\lambda_z$.\n$$ \\lambda_z = \\min(k_{\\mathrm{a}}, k_{\\mathrm{e}}) $$\nFor large $t$, the term with the larger rate constant, $\\max(k_{\\mathrm{a}}, k_{\\mathrm{e}})$, decays to zero much more rapidly. Thus, the concentration profile approximates:\n$$ C(t) \\approx \\text{Constant} \\times e^{-\\lambda_z t} $$\nOn a semi-logarithmic plot ($\\ln(C(t))$ vs. $t$), this terminal phase becomes a straight line:\n$$ \\ln(C(t)) \\approx \\ln(\\text{Constant}) - \\lambda_z t $$\nThe slope of this terminal linear portion is $-\\lambda_z$.\n\n**3. Applying to the \"True\" System (Flip-Flop Kinetics)**\n\nThe problem states the true parameters are $k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}=0.15\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}=0.60\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. In this case:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}  k_{\\mathrm{e,true}} $$\nThis condition defines **flip-flop kinetics**: the absorption process is the rate-limiting step in the terminal phase, not the elimination process.\nThe terminal-phase rate constant is therefore:\n$$ \\lambda_z = \\min(k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}, k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}) = k_{\\mathrm{a,true}} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\nThe slope of the terminal log-linear decline is $-\\lambda_z = -0.15\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. This matches the experimental observation given in the problem, confirming the scenario is self-consistent.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Modeler's Error**\n\nThe modeler is unaware of flip-flop kinetics and works under the common (but in this case, false) assumption that elimination is always the slower process, i.e., $k_{\\mathrm{a}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{e}}$. Following standard practice for non-flip-flop cases, the modeler equates the magnitude of the terminal slope with the elimination rate constant.\nLet $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}$ be the inferred elimination rate constant.\n$$ \\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}} = (\\text{magnitude of terminal slope}) = \\lambda_z = k_{\\mathrm{a,true}} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\nComparing the inferred value to the true value:\n$$ \\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad k_{\\mathrm{e,true}} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\nThe modeler incorrectly infers the elimination rate constant. The true elimination rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}$ is substantially **underestimated**.\n\n**5. Consequences for Downstream Parameters**\n\nWe now analyze the impact on the apparent clearance ($CL/F$) and apparent volume of distribution ($V/F$), which are key parameters derived from oral data.\n\n-   **Apparent Clearance over Bioavailability ($CL/F$)**:\n    This parameter is fundamentally related to the total Area Under the Curve ($\\mathrm{AUC}_{0-\\infty}$) by the formula:\n    $$ \\frac{CL}{F} = \\frac{D}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{0-\\infty}} $$\n    The $\\mathrm{AUC}_{0-\\infty}$ can be calculated by integrating the concentration function $C(t)$ or, more practically, estimated non-parametrically from the concentration-time data (e.g., using the trapezoidal rule). Let's find the theoretical AUC:\n    $$ \\mathrm{AUC}_{0-\\infty} = \\int_0^\\infty C(t) dt = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{F D k_{\\mathrm{a}}}{V(k_{\\mathrm{e}}-k_{\\mathrm{a}})} (e^{-k_{\\mathrm{a}} t} - e^{-k_{\\mathrm{e}} t}) dt = \\frac{F D k_{\\mathrm{a}}}{V(k_{\\mathrm{e}}-k_{\\mathrm{a}})} \\left[ \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{a}}} - \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\right] = \\frac{F D}{V k_{\\mathrm{e}}} $$\n    This result shows that AUC depends on $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$, but not $k_{\\mathrm{a}}$. Since the AUC is a property of the data itself, its value calculated from the profile is robust regardless of the modeler's interpretation of the rate constants. Therefore, the estimate of $CL/F = D/\\mathrm{AUC}$ will be close to the true value.\n    $$ \\widehat{\\frac{CL}{F}} = \\frac{D}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\text{measured}}} \\approx \\frac{D}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\text{true}}} = \\frac{D}{(F D) / (V k_{\\mathrm{e,true}})} = \\frac{V k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}}{F} = \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{true}}}{F} $$\n    Conclusion: The estimate of $CL/F$ remains **unchanged** or unbiased.\n\n-   **Apparent Volume of Distribution over Bioavailability ($V/F$)**:\n    This parameter is typically calculated from a combination of $CL/F$ and the estimated elimination rate constant, $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}$. The standard relationship is $CL = k_{\\mathrm{e}} V$, which rearranges to $V/F = (CL/F) / k_{\\mathrm{e}}$.\n    The modeler will calculate:\n    $$ \\widehat{\\frac{V}{F}} = \\frac{\\widehat{CL/F}}{\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}} $$\n    Using our findings: $\\widehat{CL/F} \\approx \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{true}}}{F} = \\frac{V k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}}{F}$, and $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}} = k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}$.\n    $$ \\widehat{\\frac{V}{F}} \\approx \\frac{(V k_{\\mathrm{e,true}})/F}{k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}} = \\frac{V}{F} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}}{k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}} \\right) $$\n    The true value is $V/F$. The estimated value is this true value multiplied by a factor of $k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}/k_{\\mathrm{a,true}} = k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}/\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}$.\n    Since $k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}  k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}$, this factor is greater than $1$. In this specific case, the factor is $0.60/0.15 = 4$.\n    Conclusion: The apparent volume of distribution $V/F$ is significantly **inflated** (overestimated).\n\n-   **Apparent Terminal Half-Life ($t_{1/2}$)**:\n    The half-life associated with the terminal phase is $t_{1/2, \\lambda_z} = \\ln(2)/\\lambda_z$. In this case of flip-flop kinetics, $\\lambda_z = k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}$.\n    Thus, the observed terminal half-life is $t_{1/2, \\text{app}} = \\ln(2)/k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}$, which is the **absorption half-life**. The modeler misinterprets this as the elimination half-life, which is properly $t_{1/2, \\mathrm{e}} = \\ln(2)/k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nBased on the derivations above:\n\n**A. The inferred elimination rate constant $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}$ equals the observed terminal slope and therefore $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}=k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}$, causing underestimation of the true $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$. The apparent clearance over bioavailability $CL/F$ estimated from $D/\\mathrm{AUC}$ remains unchanged, whereas the apparent volume over bioavailability $V/F$ is inflated by the factor $k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}/\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}$. The apparent terminal half-life equals the absorption half-life and not the elimination half-life.**\n-   $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}} = k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}$: **Correct**.\n-   underestimation of $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$: **Correct**.\n-   $CL/F$ remains unchanged: **Correct**.\n-   $V/F$ is inflated by the factor $k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}/\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}$: **Correct**.\n-   Apparent terminal half-life is the absorption half-life: **Correct**.\nEvery statement in this option is consistent with our rigorous derivation.\n\n**B. The inferred elimination rate constant $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}$ equals the true $k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}$ because $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is independent of $k_{\\mathrm{a}}$ when fitting oral data, so there is no bias in $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$ or $V/F$. The apparent clearance over bioavailability $CL/F$ is underestimated by a factor of $F$ in flip-flop kinetics.**\n-   $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}} = k_{\\mathrm{e,true}}$: **Incorrect**. The modeler infers $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}$ from the terminal slope, which corresponds to $k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}$ in this scenario.\n-   No bias in $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$ or $V/F$: **Incorrect**. There is significant bias in both.\n-   $CL/F$ is underestimated: **Incorrect**. $CL/F$ is robustly estimated.\n\n**C. The inferred elimination rate constant $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}$ equals $k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}$, leading to underestimation of $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$, and this underestimation also causes the apparent clearance over bioavailability $CL/F$ derived from oral data to be overestimated in proportion to $1/k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}$ because the late-phase area under the curve (AUC) is absorption-limited.**\n-   $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}} = k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}$ and underestimation of $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$: **Correct**.\n-   $CL/F$ is overestimated: **Incorrect**. As shown, $CL/F$ is robustly estimated via $D/\\mathrm{AUC}$. The reasoning provided about AUC is also flawed; the *total* AUC is determined by $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$, not limited by absorption.\n\n**D. The inferred elimination rate constant $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}}$ equals $k_{\\mathrm{e,true}} + k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}$, causing overestimation of $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$. The apparent volume over bioavailability $V/F$ is therefore underestimated, while the apparent clearance over bioavailability $CL/F$ remains invariant.**\n-   $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{e}} = k_{\\mathrm{e,true}} + k_{\\mathrm{a,true}}$: **Incorrect**. This is nonsensical; the terminal rate constant is the minimum of a set of first-order rate constants, not their sum.\n-   causing overestimation of $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$: **Incorrect**. It is an underestimation.\n-   $V/F$ is underestimated: **Incorrect**. It is inflated (overestimated).\n-   $CL/F$ remains invariant: This part is correct, but the rest of the statement is fundamentally flawed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis demonstrates that every assertion in option A is correct. The misidentification of the terminal rate constant in a flip-flop kinetic scenario leads to underestimation of $k_{\\mathrm{e}}$, overestimation of $V/F$, and no change in $CL/F$, with the apparent half-life reflecting absorption, not elimination.",

You will practice quantifying molecular similarity using the Tanimoto coefficient, a standard method for defining a model's AD, and learn how to determine if a prediction for a new molecule can be trusted.

            "problem": "Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) property prediction models often rely on applicability domain assessments based on chemical similarity in the space of Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP). Consider a binary ECFP representation with $p=1024$ bits, where each molecule is represented by the set of activated fingerprint indices. Let a query molecule $Q$ have $|Q|=72$ activated bits. A training corpus $\\mathcal{T}$ contains $5$ molecules $\\{M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, M_5\\}$ with activated bit counts and pairwise overlaps with $Q$ as follows:\n- $|M_1|=64$, and $|Q \\cap M_1|=22$.\n- $|M_2|=85$, and $|Q \\cap M_2|=27$.\n- $|M_3|=70$, and $|Q \\cap M_3|=30$.\n- $|M_4|=78$, and $|Q \\cap M_4|=33$.\n- $|M_5|=76$, and $|Q \\cap M_5|=34$.\n\nUsing the standard set-theoretic definition of similarity on binary fingerprints, compute the nearest-neighbor Tanimoto similarity between $Q$ and the training set $\\mathcal{T}$, and, based on a predefined applicability domain threshold $t_{\\mathrm{dom}}=0.35$, decide whether $Q$ is out-of-domain for the model. Report only the nearest-neighbor similarity value, rounded to four significant figures. Express your answer as a unitless decimal.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the nearest-neighbor Tanimoto similarity for a query molecule $Q$ with respect to a training set $\\mathcal{T}$ of five molecules, represented by Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP). The applicability domain of the underlying model is then assessed based on this similarity.\n\nFirst, the Tanimoto similarity coefficient, $T_c$, for two molecules $A$ and $B$, represented as sets of activated fingerprint bits, is defined by the standard set-theoretic formula:\n$$T_c(A, B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|}$$\nwhere $|A \\cap B|$ is the number of bits activated in both molecules (the size of the intersection of the sets) and $|A \\cup B|$ is the number of bits activated in at least one of the two molecules (the size of the union of the sets). The size of the union can be expressed using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n$$|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|$$\nSubstituting this into the Tanimoto coefficient formula gives the form used for calculation:\n$$T_c(A, B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|}$$\nThe dimension of the fingerprint space, $p=1024$, is not required for this calculation, which depends only on the counts of activated bits.\n\nThe givens for the query molecule $Q$ and the training set $\\mathcal{T} = \\{M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, M_5\\}$ are:\n- $|Q| = 72$\n- For $M_1$: $|M_1| = 64$, $|Q \\cap M_1| = 22$\n- For $M_2$: $|M_2| = 85$, $|Q \\cap M_2| = 27$\n- For $M_3$: $|M_3| = 70$, $|Q \\cap M_3| = 30$\n- For $M_4$: $|M_4| = 78$, $|Q \\cap M_4| = 33$\n- For $M_5$: $|M_5| = 76$, $|Q \\cap M_5| = 34$\n\nWe now compute the Tanimoto similarity between $Q$ and each molecule $M_i$ in $\\mathcal{T}$.\n\nFor $M_1$:\n$$T_c(Q, M_1) = \\frac{|Q \\cap M_1|}{|Q| + |M_1| - |Q \\cap M_1|} = \\frac{22}{72 + 64 - 22} = \\frac{22}{114} \\approx 0.19298$$\n\nFor $M_2$:\n$$T_c(Q, M_2) = \\frac{|Q \\cap M_2|}{|Q| + |M_2| - |Q \\cap M_2|} = \\frac{27}{72 + 85 - 27} = \\frac{27}{130} \\approx 0.20769$$\n\nFor $M_3$:\n$$T_c(Q, M_3) = \\frac{|Q \\cap M_3|}{|Q| + |M_3| - |Q \\cap M_3|} = \\frac{30}{72 + 70 - 30} = \\frac{30}{112} \\approx 0.26786$$\n\nFor $M_4$:\n$$T_c(Q, M_4) = \\frac{|Q \\cap M_4|}{|Q| + |M_4| - |Q \\cap M_4|} = \\frac{33}{72 + 78 - 33} = \\frac{33}{117} \\approx 0.28205$$\n\nFor $M_5$:\n$$T_c(Q, M_5) = \\frac{|Q \\cap M_5|}{|Q| + |M_5| - |Q \\cap M_5|} = \\frac{34}{72 + 76 - 34} = \\frac{34}{114} \\approx 0.29825$$\n\nThe set of similarity values is $\\{0.19298, 0.20769, 0.26786, 0.28205, 0.29825\\}$. The nearest-neighbor similarity is the maximum value in this set.\n$$\\max(\\{T_c(Q, M_i)\\}_{i=1}^5) = T_c(Q, M_5) \\approx 0.29825$$\n\nThe problem requires a decision on the applicability domain based on the threshold $t_{\\mathrm{dom}}=0.35$. A molecule is considered out-of-domain if its similarity to all training set members is below this threshold. In this case, the nearest-neighbor (maximum) similarity is approximately $0.298$, which is less than $t_{\\mathrm{dom}}=0.35$.\n$$0.298  0.35$$\nTherefore, the query molecule $Q$ is considered to be out-of-domain for the model.\n\nThe final step is to report the nearest-neighbor similarity value rounded to four significant figures.\nThe nearest-neighbor similarity is $T_c(Q, M_5) = \\frac{34}{114} \\approx 0.2982456...$.\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives $0.2982$.",
