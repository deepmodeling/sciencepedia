The values for the sample and standard ratios are physically realistic for natural geologic materials. The VPDB standard is the correct and universally accepted reference for carbon isotope measurements.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

It is free from ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe isotopic composition of a sample is conventionally expressed using the delta ($\\delta$) notation, which reports the relative deviation of the sample's isotope ratio from that of an international standard. The isotope ratio, $R$, for carbon is defined as the abundance of the heavy isotope, $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$, to the light isotope, $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\text{abundance}(^{13}\\mathrm{C})}{\\text{abundance}(^{12}\\mathrm{C})}\n$$\nThe delta value, specifically for carbon-13 ($\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}$), is defined as the difference between the sample ratio ($R_{\\mathrm{sample}}$) and the standard ratio ($R_{\\mathrm{standard}}$), normalized by the standard ratio, and multiplied by $1000$ to express the result in parts per thousand, or per mil (‰).\n\nThe formal expression for $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C} = \\left( \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sample}}}{R_{\\mathrm{standard}}} - 1 \\right) \\times 1000\n$$\nIn this expression, $R_{\\mathrm{sample}}$ is the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$/$^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ ratio of the sample, and $R_{\\mathrm{standard}}$ is the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$/$^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ ratio of the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) standard.\n\nTo compute the numerical value for the given sample, we substitute the provided values into this derived expression:\n-   $R_{\\mathrm{sample}} = 0.0109858$\n-   $R_{\\mathrm{standard}} = 0.0111802$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$\n\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C} = \\left( \\frac{0.0109858}{0.0111802} - 1 \\right) \\times 1000\n$$\nFirst, we compute the ratio term:\n$$\n\\frac{0.0109858}{0.0111802} \\approx 0.98261211\n$$\nNext, we subtract $1$:\n$$\n0.98261211 - 1 = -0.01738789\n$$\nFinally, we multiply by $1000$ to obtain the value in per mil:\n$$\n\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C} = -0.01738789 \\times 1000 = -17.38789 \\, \\text{‰}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $-17.38789$. The first four significant figures are $1$, $7$, $3$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $7$, which requires rounding up the fourth digit.\nTherefore, the rounded value is $-17.39$‰.\n\n### Interpretation of the Result\n\nThe computed $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ value of $-17.39$‰ has a specific geochemical meaning regarding its sign and magnitude.\n\n1.  **Sign:** The negative sign indicates that the sample is depleted in the heavy isotope ($^{13}\\mathrm{C}$) relative to the VPDB standard. This means the sample has a lower $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$/$^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ ratio than the standard material. In common parlance, the sample is isotopically \"light\".\n\n2.  **Magnitude and Process:** The magnitude of the depletion ($-17.39$‰) is significant and points towards a biological origin for the carbon. Isotope fractionation is the partitioning of isotopes between two substances or phases. This partitioning can be driven by equilibrium or kinetic processes.\n    -   **Equilibrium isotope effects** occur in reversible reactions at thermodynamic equilibrium. The fractionation factors are typically small at Earth-surface temperatures and are temperature-dependent.\n    -   **Kinetic isotope effects** occur in unidirectional, incomplete reactions, where molecules containing the lighter isotope react faster than those with the heavier isotope. Biological processes, such as photosynthesis and microbial metabolism, are classic examples of reactions governed by kinetic isotope effects and typically result in large fractionations.\n\n    In this problem, the sample is dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from marine porewater. The primary control on the $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ of DIC in such an environment is the balance between DIC from overlying seawater (which has a $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ value near $0$‰ to $+2$‰) and DIC produced within the sediments. The main process producing DIC in sediments is the remineralization (decomposition) of organic matter.\n    During photosynthesis, primary producers (e.g., phytoplankton) preferentially incorporate the lighter $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ isotope. This kinetic fractionation results in marine organic matter having a strongly negative $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ value, typically averaging around $-20$‰ to $-25$‰. When this organic matter sinks to the seafloor and is decomposed by microbes in the sediment, this isotopically light carbon is released back into the porewater as DIC (e.g., as $CO_2$ from respiration). The strongly negative $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ value of $-17.39$‰ is therefore a clear signature of the addition of a significant amount of carbon derived from the degradation of organic matter, a process dominated by a **kinetic isotope effect**. The value represents a mixture of seawater DIC and remineralized organic carbon.\n\nThe final answer, representing the numerical value of $\\delta^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ in per mil relative to VPDB and rounded to four significant figures, is $-17.39$.",

            "problem": "A gas-phase isotopic mixture of water comprising light isotopologues $\\mathrm{H_2^{16}O}$ and heavy isotopologues $\\mathrm{H_2^{18}O}$ is contained in a well-mixed reservoir at temperature $T$ and number density $n$, connected to vacuum through a membrane whose pores are cylindrical and sufficiently small that molecular transport occurs in the free-molecular (Knudsen) regime. The pores are nonreactive and have identical geometry for both isotopologues. Define the kinetic isotope fractionation factor for effusive transport as $\\alpha \\equiv \\dfrac{J_{\\text{heavy}}}{J_{\\text{light}}}$, where $J_{\\text{heavy}}$ and $J_{\\text{light}}$ are the molar fluxes of $\\mathrm{H_2^{18}O}$ and $\\mathrm{H_2^{16}O}$ through the membrane, respectively.\n\nStarting from first principles of kinetic theory and the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution, and invoking Graham’s law of effusion as a well-tested consequence of those principles, derive an expression for $\\alpha$ in terms of the molecular masses $m_{\\text{light}}$ and $m_{\\text{heavy}}$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and evaluation of the kinetic isotope fractionation factor, $\\alpha$, for the effusion of water isotopologues $\\mathrm{H_2^{16}O}$ (light) and $\\mathrm{H_2^{18}O}$ (heavy) through a porous membrane. The factor is defined as the ratio of the molar fluxes, $\\alpha \\equiv \\dfrac{J_{\\text{heavy}}}{J_{\\text{light}}}$.\n\nThe derivation begins from the first principles of the kinetic theory of gases. The transport occurs in the free-molecular or Knudsen regime, where molecule-wall collisions dominate over molecule-molecule collisions. The flux of gas molecules of a species $i$ passing through an orifice of area $A$ is given by the Hertz-Knudsen equation. The molar flux $J_i$ (moles per unit area per unit time) is proportional to the rate at which molecules strike the surface, which is given by:\n$$J_i = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{n_i^*}{N_A} \\langle v_i \\rangle$$\nwhere $n_i^*$ is the number density (molecules per unit volume) of species $i$ in the reservoir, $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant, and $\\langle v_i \\rangle$ is the mean speed of the molecules of species $i$. The problem uses the symbol $n$ for number density, so we will adopt this, noting that it corresponds to $n_i^*/N_A$ in molar units. The flux can be written in terms of number density $n_i$ (with units of moles per volume) as $J_i = \\frac{1}{4} n_i \\langle v_i \\rangle$.\n\nThe mean molecular speed $\\langle v_i \\rangle$ for a gas at thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$ is derived from the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution. The result of this derivation is a well-known formula:\n$$\\langle v_i \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{\\pi m_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 R T}{\\pi M_i}}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $m_i$ is the molecular mass, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $M_i$ is the molar mass ($M_i = m_i N_A$). Since the fractionation factor is a ratio, the constants will cancel, and we can work with molecular mass $m_i$.\n\nThe fluxes for the light and heavy isotopologues are therefore:\n$$J_{\\text{light}} = C \\cdot n_{\\text{light}} \\langle v_{\\text{light}} \\rangle = C \\cdot n_{\\text{light}} \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{\\pi m_{\\text{light}}}}$$\n$$J_{\\text{heavy}} = C \\cdot n_{\\text{heavy}} \\langle v_{\\text{heavy}} \\rangle = C \\cdot n_{\\text{heavy}} \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{\\pi m_{\\text{heavy}}}}$$\nThe constant $C$ incorporates geometric factors of the pores and is assumed to be identical for both isotopologues, as per the problem statement. The temperature $T$ is also the same for both species as they are in a well-mixed reservoir.\n\nThe kinetic isotope fractionation factor $\\alpha$ is defined as the ratio of these fluxes:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{J_{\\text{heavy}}}{J_{\\text{light}}} = \\frac{C \\cdot n_{\\text{heavy}} \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{\\pi m_{\\text{heavy}}}}}{C \\cdot n_{\\text{light}} \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{\\pi m_{\\text{light}}}}}$$\nThe constants $C$, $8$, $k_B$, $T$, and $\\pi$ cancel, yielding:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{n_{\\text{heavy}}}{n_{\\text{light}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_{\\text{light}}}{m_{\\text{heavy}}}}$$\nThis expression directly relates the ratio of fluxes to the ratio of number densities and the inverse square root of the ratio of molecular masses. The term $\\sqrt{m_{\\text{light}}/m_{\\text{heavy}}}$ is the essence of Graham's law of effusion.\n\nThe problem states to \"Assume both isotopologues have the same number density $n$ in the reservoir.\" This implies that $n_{\\text{light}} = n_{\\text{heavy}}$, so the ratio $\\frac{n_{\\text{heavy}}}{n_{\\text{light}}} = 1$. Under this specific condition, the expression for $\\alpha$ simplifies to:\n$$\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_{\\text{light}}}{m_{\\text{heavy}}}}$$\n\nThe applicability of this expression to transport in a porous medium is contingent on the flow regime. The derivation is valid under the following conditions:\n$1$. The transport must be in the Knudsen diffusion regime. This requires the mean free path of gas molecules, $\\lambda$, to be significantly larger than the pore diameter, $d$. This is quantified by the Knudsen number, $Kn = \\lambda/d$, which must be large (typically $Kn \\gg 1$). This condition ensures that collisions between molecules and pore walls are far more frequent than collisions between molecules themselves within the pores.\n$2$. The pore surfaces are chemically inert and do not interact preferentially with one isotopologue over the other (e.g., via adsorption). This is stated in the problem (\"nonreactive\").\n$3$. The pressure on the downstream side of the membrane is negligible (\"vacuum\"), preventing back-effusion.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\alpha$ numerically for the given water isotopologues.\nThe light isotopologue is $\\mathrm{H_2^{16}O}$ and the heavy isotopologue is $\\mathrm{H_2^{18}O}$.\nThe atomic masses are given as:\n$m({}^{1}\\mathrm{H}) = 1.007825\\ \\mathrm{u}$\n$m({}^{16}\\mathrm{O}) = 15.994915\\ \\mathrm{u}$\n$m({}^{18}\\mathrm{O}) = 17.999160\\ \\mathrm{u}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the molecular mass for each isotopologue.\nThe mass of the light isotopologue, $m_{\\text{light}}$, is:\n$$m_{\\text{light}} = m(\\mathrm{H_2^{16}O}) = 2 \\times m({}^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + m({}^{16}\\mathrm{O})$$\n$$m_{\\text{light}} = 2 \\times 1.007825\\ \\mathrm{u} + 15.994915\\ \\mathrm{u} = 2.015650\\ \\mathrm{u} + 15.994915\\ \\mathrm{u} = 18.010565\\ \\mathrm{u}$$\nThe mass of the heavy isotopologue, $m_{\\text{heavy}}$, is:\n$$m_{\\text{heavy}} = m(\\mathrm{H_2^{18}O}) = 2 \\times m({}^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + m({}^{18}\\mathrm{O})$$\n$$m_{\\text{heavy}} = 2 \\times 1.007825\\ \\mathrm{u} + 17.999160\\ \\mathrm{u} = 2.015650\\ \\mathrm{u} + 17.999160\\ \\mathrm{u} = 20.014810\\ \\mathrm{u}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these masses into the simplified expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_{\\text{light}}}{m_{\\text{heavy}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{18.010565\\ \\mathrm{u}}{20.014810\\ \\mathrm{u}}}$$\nThe atomic mass units ($\\mathrm{u}$) cancel out, leaving a dimensionless number.\n$$\\alpha = \\sqrt{0.899861622...}$$\n$$\\alpha \\approx 0.94861036$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to five significant figures.\n$$\\alpha \\approx 0.94861$$\nThis value, being less than $1$, indicates that the lighter isotopologue ($\\mathrm{H_2^{16}O}$) effuses faster than the heavier one ($\\mathrm{H_2^{18}O}$), as expected from kinetic theory.",

Therefore, the frequency for the light isotope is $\\tilde{\\nu}_L = \\tilde{\\nu}_H / s = \\tilde{\\nu}_H \\sqrt{m_H/m_L}$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.\nThe scaling factor for frequencies is $\\sqrt{m_H/m_L} = \\sqrt{56/54} = \\sqrt{28/27}$.\nThe constant prefactor for $u$ is $\\frac{hc}{k_B} \\approx 1.438777\\ \\mathrm{cm \\cdot K}$.\nAt $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $u = \\frac{1.438777}{298} \\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 0.00482811 \\times \\tilde{\\nu}$ for $\\tilde{\\nu}$ in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nFor complex II ($[\\mathrm{Fe(H_2O)_6}]^{2+}$):\n$\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{II},H} = 420\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$u_{\\mathrm{II},H} = 0.00482811 \\times 420 \\approx 2.027806$\n$\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{II},L} = 420 \\times \\sqrt{28/27} \\approx 427.707\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$u_{\\mathrm{II},L} = u_{\\mathrm{II},H} \\times \\sqrt{28/27} \\approx 2.065215$\nNow we calculate $\\beta_{\\mathrm{II}}$:\n$$ \\ln(\\beta_{\\mathrm{II}}) = \\frac{u_{\\mathrm{II},L} - u_{\\mathrm{II},H}}{2} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\exp(-u_{\\mathrm{II},L})}{1 - \\exp(-u_{\\mathrm{II},H})}\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln(\\beta_{\\mathrm{II}}) = \\frac{2.065215 - 2.027806}{2} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\exp(-2.065215)}{1 - \\exp(-2.027806)}\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln(\\beta_{\\mathrm{II}}) = 0.0187045 + \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - 0.12678}{1 - 0.13163}\\right) = 0.0187045 + \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.87322}{0.86837}\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln(\\beta_{\\mathrm{II}}) = 0.0187045 + \\ln(1.005585) = 0.0187045 + 0.005569 = 0.0242735 $$\n$$ \\beta_{\\mathrm{II}} = \\exp(0.0242735) \\approx 1.02457 $$\n\nFor complex III ($[\\mathrm{Fe(H_2O)_6}]^{3+}$):\n$\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{III},H} = 560\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$u_{\\mathrm{III},H} = 0.00482811 \\times 560 \\approx 2.703742$\n$\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{III},L} = 560 \\times \\sqrt{28/27} \\approx 570.276\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$u_{\\mathrm{III},L} = u_{\\mathrm{III},H} \\times \\sqrt{28/27} \\approx 2.753620$\nNow we calculate $\\beta_{\\mathrm{III}}$:\n$$ \\ln(\\beta_{\\mathrm{III}}) = \\frac{u_{\\mathrm{III},L} - u_{\\mathrm{III},H}}{2} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\exp(-u_{\\mathrm{III},L})}{1 - \\exp(-u_{\\mathrmIII},H)}\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln(\\beta_{\\mathrm{III}}) = \\frac{2.753620 - 2.703742}{2} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\exp(-2.753620)}{1 - \\exp(-2.703742)}\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln(\\beta_{\\mathrm{III}}) = 0.024939 + \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - 0.06369}{1 - 0.06695}\\right) = 0.024939 + \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.93631}{0.93305}\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln(\\beta_{\\mathrm{III}}) = 0.024939 + \\ln(1.003494) = 0.024939 + 0.003488 = 0.028427 $$\n$$ \\beta_{\\mathrm{III}} = \\exp(0.028427) \\approx 1.02883 $$\n\nFinally, the fractionation factor is:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{III-II}} = \\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{III}}}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{II}}} = \\frac{1.02883}{1.02457} \\approx 1.004158 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $1.004$.\n\nRegarding the qualitative explanation:\nStronger ligand fields promote low-spin electronic configurations, which, by depopulating antibonding $e_g^*$ orbitals, lead to stiffer $\\mathrm{Fe{-}O}$ bonds and thus higher vibrational frequencies compared to high-spin states. Qualitatively, this increased bond stiffness magnifies the vibrational energy differences between isotopes, leading to larger equilibrium fractionation factors (as shown by the Bigeleisen-Mayer theory) and more pronounced kinetic isotope effects for reactions involving bond cleavage.",
