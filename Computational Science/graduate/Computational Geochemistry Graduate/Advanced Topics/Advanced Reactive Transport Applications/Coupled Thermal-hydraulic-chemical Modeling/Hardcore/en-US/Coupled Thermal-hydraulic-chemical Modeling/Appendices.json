            "solution": "This problem involves deriving the macroscopic law for flow in a porous medium from first principles and then applying it to a specific scenario.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Constitutive Relation**\n\nThe problem asks to start from the principles for steady, laminar, incompressible flow at low Reynolds number. This flow regime is described by the Stokes equations for momentum conservation and the continuity equation for mass conservation at the pore scale. For horizontal flow where gravity is neglected, the Stokes equation is:\n$$\n\\nabla p - \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the microscopic pressure, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\\mathbf{v}$ is the microscopic fluid velocity.\n\nTo obtain a macroscopic law, we perform volume averaging over a Representative Elementary Volume (REV). This process mathematically upscales the pore-scale physics to the continuum scale of the porous medium. The volumetric specific discharge, $\\mathbf{u}$ (also known as Darcy velocity), is defined as the volume average of the microscopic velocity, $\\mathbf{u} = \\langle \\mathbf{v} \\rangle$.\n\nApplying the volume averaging operator to the Stokes equation and utilizing the spatial averaging theorem relates the average of the gradients to the gradient of the averages. The rigorous derivation shows that the viscous drag term, $\\langle \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} \\rangle$, which represents the resistance to flow from the solid matrix, is linearly proportional to the specific discharge $\\mathbf{u}$. The driving force is the macroscopic pressure gradient, $\\nabla P$, where $P = \\langle p \\rangle$ is the macroscopic pressure.\n\nThe result of this formal upscaling for a general anisotropic medium is a linear relationship:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{\\mathbf{k}}{\\mu} \\nabla P\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{k}$ is the permeability tensor. Since the problem specifies a homogeneous and **isotropic** medium, the permeability tensor simplifies to a scalar quantity, $\\mathbf{k} = k\\mathbf{I}$, where $k$ is the intrinsic permeability.\n\nThe final constitutive linear relation is **Darcy's Law**:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla P\n$$\nThis equation states that the specific discharge vector $\\mathbf{u}$ is directly proportional to the negative of the pressure gradient vector, $-\\nabla P$, which is the driving force for flow.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Specific Discharge and Volumetric Discharge**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Pressure gradient: $\\nabla P = (100, 0, 0)\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,m^{-1}}$\n*   Intrinsic permeability: $k = 1.0 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n*   Dynamic viscosity: $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s}$\n*   Cross-sectional area: $A = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the specific discharge vector $\\mathbf{u}$ using Darcy's Law:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s}} (100\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,m^{-1}}, 0, 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} = -(1.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,Pa^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}) (100\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,m^{-1}}, 0, 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} = (-1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}, 0, 0)\n$$\nThe $x$-component of the volumetric specific discharge is therefore:\n$$\nu_x = -1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the flow is in the $-x$ direction, opposite to the direction of the pressure gradient (i.e., from high pressure to low pressure).\n\nNext, we compute the volumetric discharge $Q$ through the cross section of area $A$.
