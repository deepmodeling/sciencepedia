Consider a ferric hydroxyl surface site written as $\\equiv\\mathrm{FeOH}$ interacting with aqueous protons. The system is isothermal and dilute so that activities of aqueous species can be approximated by concentrations, and the zero-plane electrostatic potential is taken as zero (no electrostatic correction). The aqueous proton activity is defined by $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}$, and the intrinsic equilibrium constant $K^{0}$ for a reaction is related to its intrinsic acidity constant by $pK^{0} = -\\log_{10} K^{0}$. \n\nYou are given an intrinsic acidity constant $pK^{0} = 7.5$ associated with the deprotonation of the protonated surface species. \n\n- Write the two acid–base reactions that interconvert $\\equiv\\mathrm{FeOH}$ and $\\equiv\\mathrm{FeOH_{2}^{+}}$ (one as a protonation and the other as a deprotonation).\n- Starting from the law of mass action and a site mass balance, derive from first principles an expression for the fraction of protonated sites, defined as $\\theta_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{[\\equiv\\mathrm{FeOH_{2}^{+}}]}{[\\equiv\\mathrm{FeOH_{2}^{+}}] + [\\equiv\\mathrm{FeOH}] }$, in terms of $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $pK^{0}$ under the stated assumptions, and then evaluate this fraction at $\\mathrm{pH} = 6$ for $pK^{0} = 7.5$.\n\nExpress the final fraction as a unitless decimal number rounded to four significant figures.",

In the Charge Distribution – Multiple Site Complexation (CD-MUSIC) model, the charge of an adsorbing ion is distributed over its bonds according to the bond-valence concept: the bond valence $s$ (in valence units) of each metal–oxygen bond contributes a portion of the metal’s formal valence $Z_{\\mathrm{M}}$ to the atom it bonds, and the sum of all bond valences around the metal equals $Z_{\\mathrm{M}}$. Assume the two inner-sphere $\\mathrm{Pb}$–$\\mathrm{O}$ bonds to the surface each have a bond valence of $s_{\\mathrm{Pb-O}} = 0.8$ (valence units), and the remaining coordination of $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ is satisfied by hydration in the electrolyte (ignore any direct mineral-plane contribution from these solution ligands).

Express the final net charge in units of the elementary charge $e$ as a single real number. Do not include units in your final numeric answer.",
            "solution": "The user's problem has been validated and is determined to be a valid, well-posed scientific problem.\n\nThe problem asks for the net charge added to the Stern layer upon the formation of an inner-sphere bidentate lead complex on a hematite-like surface, according to the Charge Distribution – Multiple Site Complexation (CD-MUSIC) model.\n\nFirst, we establish the initial state. The surface consists of deprotonated ferric hydroxyl groups, $\\equiv\\mathrm{FeO}^{-}$, each carrying a formal charge of $-1$ elementary charge unit, $e$. This charge is located at the surface oxygen, which defines the $0$-plane in the electrical double layer (EDL) model. The adsorbing species is a divalent lead ion, $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$, with a formal valence of $Z_{\\mathrm{Pb}} = +2$.\n\nThe lead ion forms a bidentate complex by binding to two $\\equiv\\mathrm{FeO}^{-}$ sites. The reaction can be written as:\n$$\n2(\\equiv\\mathrm{FeO}^{-}) + \\mathrm{Pb}^{2+} \\rightarrow (\\equiv\\mathrm{FeO})_2\\mathrm{Pb}\n$$\nThe CD-MUSIC model distributes the charge of the central metal ion, $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$, among its bonds based on the bond-valence concept. The total valence of the lead ion, $Z_{\\mathrm{Pb}} = +2$, must be conserved, meaning the sum of the valences of all bonds originating from the $\\mathrm{Pb}$ ion must equal $+2$.\n\nThe problem states that the $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ ion forms two inner-sphere bonds with two surface oxygens. Each of these $\\mathrm{Pb}$–$\\mathrm{O}$ bonds has a bond valence, $s_{\\mathrm{Pb-O}}$, of $0.8$ valence units (v.u.). In the CD-MUSIC framework, this bond valence represents the amount of positive charge (in units of $e$) that the cation ($\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$) contributes to the anion it is bonded to (the surface oxygen).\n\nTherefore, the total charge contributed by the $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ ion to the two surface oxygens in the $0$-plane is the sum of the bond valences of the two inner-sphere bonds:\n$$\n\\Delta q_{0\\text{-plane}} = 2 \\times s_{\\mathrm{Pb-O}} = 2 \\times 0.8 = 1.6\n$$\nThis value, $+1.6e$, is the portion of the lead ion's charge that is effectively transferred to the $0$-plane.\n\nThe remaining charge of the lead ion is assigned to the lead atom itself. The sum of all bond valences must equal the ion's formal valence. The problem specifies that the remaining coordination of $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ is satisfied by hydration, meaning any other bonds are to water molecules in the electrolyte and not to the mineral surface. The charge assigned to the lead ion's location is therefore its original charge minus the charge distributed to the surface bonds. This residual charge, $q_{\\mathrm{res}}$, is:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{res}} = Z_{\\mathrm{Pb}} - (2 \\times s_{\\mathrm{Pb-O}})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{res}} = 2 - (2 \\times 0.8) = 2 - 1.6 = 0.4\n$$\nThis residual charge of $+0.4e$ is located at the nucleus of the adsorbing ion. For an inner-sphere complex, the plane containing the nuclei of the adsorbed ions is the Stern layer, also referred to as the $1$-plane or $\\beta$-plane.\n\nThe problem asks for the net charge added to the Stern layer. Before adsorption, the $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ ion is in the bulk solution, and the Stern layer is considered to have a charge of $0$ relative to this specific adsorption event. Upon formation of the inner-sphere complex, the lead ion's center, carrying its residual charge, becomes physically located in the Stern layer.\n\nThus, the net charge added to the Stern layer ($1$-plane) is precisely this residual charge, $q_{\\mathrm{res}}$.\n$$\n\\text{Net charge added to Stern layer} = q_{\\mathrm{res}} = +0.4e\n$$\nTo verify this, we can check the overall charge balance of the complex.\nThe initial charge of the two surface sites in the $0$-plane is $2 \\times (-1) = -2$.\nAfter complexation, the charge in the $0$-plane is the initial charge plus the charge transferred from the lead ion:\n$$\nq_{0\\text{-plane, final}} = -2 + (2 \\times s_{\\mathrm{Pb-O}}) = -2 + 1.6 = -0.4\n$$\nThe charge in the $1$-plane is the residual charge on the lead atom:\n$$\nq_{1\\text{-plane, final}} = q_{\\mathrm{res}} = +0.4\n$$\nThe total charge of the surface complex distributed across the EDL planes is the sum of charges in the $0$-plane and $1$-plane:\n$$\nq_{\\text{total}} = q_{0\\text{-plane, final}} + q_{1\\text{-plane, final}} = -0.4 + 0.4 = 0\n$$\nThis matches the formal charge of the neutral product $(\\equiv\\mathrm{FeO})_2\\mathrm{Pb}$, confirming the consistency of the charge distribution. The net charge added to the Stern layer is $0.4$, expressed in units of the elementary charge $e$.",

The reaction quotient is $Q = (\\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeO}^-}\\, a_{\\mathrm{H}^+})/\\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeOH}}$, leading to\n$$\\frac{\\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeO}^-}\\, a_{\\mathrm{H}^+}}{\\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeOH}}} \\;=\\; K_2^{\\mathrm{int}} \\, \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{F\\,(-1)\\,\\psi_0}{R T}\\right) \\;=\\; K_2^{\\mathrm{int}} \\, \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{F\\,\\psi_0}{R T}\\right).$$\n\n3. Lead complexation $\\equiv$FeO$^- + \\mathrm{Pb}^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons$ $\\equiv$FeOPb$^+$.\nThe reactants include $\\equiv$FeO$^-$ with $-1$ in the $0$-plane and bulk $\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$; the product $\\equiv$FeOPb$^+$ has charge distributed as $\\beta_0$ in the $0$-plane and $\\beta_1$ in the $1$-plane by CD-MUSIC parameterization. Hence $\\Delta \\sigma_{0} = \\beta_0 - (-1) = \\beta_0 + 1$ and $\\Delta \\sigma_{1} = \\beta_1 - 0 = \\beta_1$. The mass action becomes\n$$\\frac{\\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeOPb}^+}}{\\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeO}^-}\\, a_{\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}}} \\;=\\; K_3^{\\mathrm{int}} \\, \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{F}{R T}\\left[(\\beta_0+1)\\,\\psi_0 + \\beta_1\\,\\psi_1\\right]\\right).$$\n\nAqueous reactions follow the usual law of mass action without surface electrostatics:\n- Water autoprotolysis: $a_{\\mathrm{H}^+}\\, a_{\\mathrm{OH}^-} = K_w$.\n- Lead hydrolysis steps:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{PbOH}^+] }{[\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}]\\, a_{\\mathrm{H}^+}} \\;=\\; K_{\\mathrm{h},1}, \\qquad \\frac{[\\mathrm{Pb(OH)}_2^0]}{[\\mathrm{PbOH}^+]\\, a_{\\mathrm{H}^+}} \\;=\\; K_{\\mathrm{h},2}.$$\n\nConservation of sites (site mass balance) requires that the sum of surface species per area equals the total site density:\n$$N_s \\;=\\; \\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeOH}} + \\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeOH}_2^+} + \\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeO}^-} + \\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeOPb}^+}.$$\n\nConservation of lead in the batch requires that total lead equals the sum of dissolved lead species plus sorbed lead per liter (sorbed amount per area times area per liter):\n$$C_{\\mathrm{Pb},T} \\;=\\; [\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}] + [\\mathrm{PbOH}^+] + [\\mathrm{Pb(OH)}_2^0] + A_s\\, \\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeOPb}^+}.$$\n\nElectrostatics and charge balance:\nPlane charge densities from surface species are computed by summing plane charges times surface concentrations and converting to Coulombs per square meter via $F$:\n$$\\sigma_0 \\;=\\; F\\left(\\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeOH}_2^+} - \\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeO}^-} + \\beta_0\\, \\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeOPb}^+}\\right), \\qquad \\sigma_1 \\;=\\; F\\left(\\beta_1\\, \\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeOPb}^+}\\right).$$\nThe Stern layer relations enforce capacitor behavior:\n$$\\sigma_0 \\;=\\; C_{01}\\,(\\psi_0 - \\psi_1), \\qquad \\sigma_0 + \\sigma_1 \\;=\\; C_{1d}\\,(\\psi_1 - \\psi_d).$$\nThe diffuse layer charge density for a symmetric electrolyte at ionic strength $I$ is given by the Gouy–Chapman expression:\n$$\\sigma_d \\;=\\; -\\left(8 R T\\, \\varepsilon \\varepsilon_0\\, I\\right)^{1/2}\\, \\sinh\\!\\left(\\frac{F\\, \\psi_d}{2 R T}\\right),$$\nand the total interfacial electroneutrality requires\n$$\\sigma_0 + \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_d \\;=\\; 0.$$\n\nThis set is internally consistent and arises directly from the stated principles.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A:\nIt correctly applies the CD-MUSIC electrostatic corrections with $\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{F}{R T}\\sum_p \\Delta \\sigma_p \\psi_p\\right)$ and uses proper $\\Delta \\sigma$ values for protonation ($+1$ in the $0$-plane), deprotonation ($-1$ in the $0$-plane), and lead complexation ($\\Delta \\sigma_0 = \\beta_0 + 1$, $\\Delta \\sigma_1 = \\beta_1$). It uses activities $a_i$, includes water autoprotolysis and lead hydrolysis, enforces the exact site mass balance including all surface species, accounts for sorbed lead in the total batch lead balance via $A_s\\, \\Gamma_{\\equiv \\mathrm{FeOPb}^+}$, and provides the correct Stern relations (including the corrected form for the second capacitor) and Gouy–Chapman diffuse layer with interfacial electroneutrality. Verdict: Correct.\n\n- Option B:\nIt omits the CD-MUSIC electrostatic corrections entirely and uses concentrations instead of activities, which is inconsistent with thermodynamics at nonzero ionic strength. The site balance excludes $\\equiv$FeOPb$^+$, which violates conservation of sites. The lead mass balance ignores sorbed lead and the second hydrolysis species, and the charge balance uses bulk electroneutrality without interfacial electrostatics, failing to provide $\\psi_0$, $\\psi_1$, and $\\psi_d$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option C:\nIt includes exponential electrostatic terms but with incorrect signs for protonation and deprotonation (the sign in the exponent should be negative of the plane charge change times potential divided by $R T$, not positive for increased positive charge at positive potential). It also lumps $\\psi_0 + \\psi_1$ without using the CD-MUSIC charge distribution parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$; the lead electrostatic correction must weight plane potentials by the actual plane charge changes. The lead mass balance ignores sorption. The electrostatics are reduced to a single-plane capacitor without a diffuse layer, losing the essential Stern–diffuse coupling. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option D:\nIt misassigns electrostatic corrections to the wrong plane for protonation (uses $\\psi_1$ instead of $\\psi_0$), neglects deprotonation electrostatics, and imposes an arbitrary factor of $2$ in the lead complexation exponent without basis in charge distribution. The site balance includes a fictitious species $\\equiv$FeOHPb, violating conservation principles. The lead balance double counts sorption. The charge/potential relations misuse capacitor labels and apply a linearized, dimensionally inconsistent diffuse layer relation $\\sigma_d = -2 I F\\, \\psi_d$ instead of Gouy–Chapman. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only consistent and correct set.",
