            "problem": "In a reactive transport simulation of microbially mediated redox transformations in porous media, the specific growth rate of a single microbial functional group limited by a single dissolved substrate of concentration $S$ is modeled by the Monod saturation law, a widely validated empirical consequence of single-substrate enzyme kinetics and mass action, given by\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{Monod}}(S) = \\mu_{\\max}\\,\\frac{S}{K_s + S},\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\max}$ is the maximum specific growth rate and $K_s$ is the half-saturation constant.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a closed-form expression for the dimensionless concentration threshold $\\sigma^{\\*} \\equiv \\frac{S^{\\*}}{K_s}$ as a function of the relative error tolerance $\\varepsilon$. The condition defining this threshold is that the relative error between the Monod model and its first-order linear approximation remains below $\\varepsilon$ for all substrate concentrations $S$ in the interval $[0, S^{\\*}]$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in four steps:\n1.  Determine the constant $k$ for the linear approximation.\n2.  Formulate the relative error $E(S)$.\n3.  Analyze the behavior of $E(S)$ to find its supremum over the specified interval.\n4.  Solve for the threshold $\\sigma^{\\*}$ using the tolerance condition.\n\nFirst, we determine the constant $k$ for the linear uptake law, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{lin}}(S) = kS$. The problem specifies that $k$ must be equal to the initial slope of the Monod curve, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Monod}}(S)$, at $S=0$. The Monod function is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{Monod}}(S) = \\mu_{\\max}\\,\\frac{S}{K_s + S}\n$$\nTo find the slope, we compute the first derivative of $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Monod}}(S)$ with respect to $S$ using the quotient rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{Monod}}}{dS} = \\mu_{\\max} \\frac{d}{dS} \\left( \\frac{S}{K_s + S} \\right) = \\mu_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{(1)(K_s + S) - (S)(1)}{(K_s + S)^2} \\right) = \\mu_{\\max} \\frac{K_s}{(K_s + S)^2}\n$$\nEvaluating this derivative at $S=0$ gives the constant $k$:\n$$\nk = \\left. \\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{Monod}}}{dS} \\right|_{S=0} = \\mu_{\\max} \\frac{K_s}{(K_s + 0)^2} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\max}}{K_s}\n$$\nThus, the linear approximation is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{lin}}(S) = \\frac{\\mu_{\\max}}{K_s} S\n$$\n\nNext, we formulate the relative error metric, $E(S)$:\n$$\nE(S) = \\frac{|\\mu_{\\mathrm{lin}}(S) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Monod}}(S)|}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{Monod}}(S)}\n$$\nLet's analyze the difference in the numerator. For $S > 0$:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{lin}}(S) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Monod}}(S) = \\frac{\\mu_{\\max}}{K_s} S - \\mu_{\\max} \\frac{S}{K_s + S}\n$$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{lin}}(S) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Monod}}(S) = \\mu_{\\max} S \\left( \\frac{1}{K_s} - \\frac{1}{K_s + S} \\right)\n$$\nFinding a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{lin}}(S) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Monod}}(S) = \\mu_{\\max} S \\left( \\frac{(K_s + S) - K_s}{K_s (K_s + S)} \\right) = \\mu_{\\max} S \\left( \\frac{S}{K_s (K_s + S)} \\right) = \\frac{\\mu_{\\max} S^2}{K_s (K_s + S)}\n$$\nSince $\\mu_{\\max}$, $K_s$, and $S$ are all non-negative, the difference $\\mu_{\\mathrm{lin}}(S) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Monod}}(S)$ is also non-negative for $S \\geq 0$. This means the absolute value in the definition of $E(S)$ is redundant. The linear model is always an overestimate of (or equal to) the Monod model for $S \\ge 0$.\n\nNow we can write the expression for $E(S)$ for $S > 0$:\n$$\nE(S) = \\frac{\\frac{\\mu_{\\max} S^2}{K_s (K_s + S)}}{\\mu_{\\max} \\frac{S}{K_s + S}}\n$$\nBy cancelling the common factors of $\\mu_{\\max}$, $S$, and $(K_s + S)$, we obtain a very simple expression for the relative error:\n$$\nE(S) = \\frac{S}{K_s}\n$$\nNote that at $S=0$, $E(0)$ is an indeterminate form $\\frac{0}{0}$. However, the limit as $S \\to 0^{+}$ is $\\lim_{S \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{S}{K_s} = 0$, consistent with the linear model being tangent to the Monod curve at the origin.\n\nThe problem requires that $\\sup_{0 \\leq S \\leq S^{\\*}} E(S) \\leq \\varepsilon$. We need to find the supremum of $E(S)$ on the interval $[0, S^{\\*}]$. The derivative of the error function is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dS} = \\frac{d}{dS}\\left(\\frac{S}{K_s}\\right) = \\frac{1}{K_s}\n$$\nSince $K_s$ is a positive constant, the derivative $\\frac{dE}{dS}$ is positive for all $S$. This indicates that $E(S)$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function of $S$ for $S \\geq 0$. Therefore, the supremum (maximum value) of $E(S)$ on the closed interval $[0, S^{\\*}]$ must occur at the right endpoint, $S = S^{\\*}$.\n$$\n\\sup_{0 \\leq S \\leq S^{\\*}} E(S) = E(S^{\\*}) = \\frac{S^{\\*}}{K_s}\n$$\nThe tolerance condition becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{S^{\\*}}{K_s} \\leq \\varepsilon\n$$\nThe problem asks for the expression for the dimensionless threshold $\\sigma^{\\*} \\equiv \\frac{S^{\\*}}{K_s}$ such that the condition holds. This threshold represents the maximum allowable value for $\\frac{S}{K_s}$ before the error tolerance $\\varepsilon$ is violated. To find this boundary value, we set the maximum error equal to the tolerance:\n$$\n\\frac{S^{\\*}}{K_s} = \\varepsilon\n$$\nBy definition, $\\sigma^{\\*} = \\frac{S^{\\*}}{K_s}$. Therefore, we have the direct relationship:\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\*} = \\varepsilon\n$$\nThis result provides the closed-form expression for the dimensionless concentration threshold as a function of the prescribed relative error tolerance $\\varepsilon$.",

The microbial growth follows Monod kinetics, with specific growth rate $\\mu(S) = \\mu_{\\max}\\, S / (K_s + S)$, where $\\mu_{\\max}$ and $K_s$ are unknown positive parameters. Let $D$ denote the dilution rate. The governing mass balances for biomass $X$ and substrate $S$ are the standard chemostat balances derived from conservation of mass:\n- Biomass: $\\dfrac{dX}{dt} = \\left(\\mu(S) - b - D\\right) X$.\n- Substrate: $\\dfrac{dS}{dt} = D\\left(S_{\\mathrm{in}} - S\\right) - \\dfrac{1}{Y_{X/S}}\\,\\mu(S)\\,X$.\nAssume steady-state operation with positive biomass, so that steady states $(S^*, X^*)$ satisfy $\\dfrac{dX}{dt} = 0$ and $\\dfrac{dS}{dt} = 0$ with $X^* > 0$. You may perform one or more steady-state experiments by setting $D$ (and thus inducing a steady state) and measuring either $(S^*, X^*)$ or only $S^*$.\n\nUsing only the fundamental mass balances and the Monod functional form stated above (and no other shortcut formulas), evaluate the structural identifiability of $\\mu_{\\max}$ and $K_s$ from steady-state experiments under the assumptions given. In particular, assess whether the pair $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$ is uniquely recoverable (in the noise-free, model-exact sense) from:\n- a single steady-state experiment with measurements $(S^*, X^*)$ at a single known $D$, and\n- multiple steady states at distinct known dilution rates $\\{D_i\\}$ when either $(S^*, X^*)$ or only $S^*$ is measured at each $D_i$.\n\nAlso discuss whether degeneracy arises when only $S^*$ is observed at a single steady state.\n\nSelect all statements that are correct:\n\nA.

Measuring both $S^*$ and $X^*$ at a single steady state suffices to independently and uniquely identify $\\mu_{\\max}$ and $K_s$.\n\nD.

            "solution": "We begin from the fundamental chemostat mass balances and the Monod kinetic form. At a steady state with positive biomass $X^* > 0$, the biomass balance gives\n$$\n0 = \\left(\\mu(S^*) - b - D\\right) X^* \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\mu(S^*) = D + b.\n$$\nBecause $\\mu(S) = \\mu_{\\max}\\, \\dfrac{S}{K_s + S}$, the biomass balance at steady state imposes\n$$\n\\mu_{\\max}\\, \\frac{S^*}{K_s + S^*} = D + b.\n$$\nThis is a single algebraic equation in the two unknowns $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$ for a given steady-state $S^*$ at known $D$ and $b$.\n\nThe substrate balance at steady state is\n$$\n0 = D\\left(S_{\\mathrm{in}} - S^*\\right) - \\frac{1}{Y_{X/S}}\\, \\mu(S^*)\\, X^*.\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mu(S^*) = D + b$ obtained from the biomass balance yields\n$$\nD\\left(S_{\\mathrm{in}} - S^*\\right) = \\frac{1}{Y_{X/S}}\\,(D + b)\\, X^*.\n$$\nCrucially, this second equation involves the observables $(S^*, X^*)$, the known inputs $(D, S_{\\mathrm{in}})$, and the known constants $(Y_{X/S}, b)$, but it does not involve the unknown kinetic parameters $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$ beyond the combination already enforced by the biomass balance. Therefore, observing $X^*$ at a single steady state does not add an independent constraint on $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$ beyond what is encoded in $\\mu(S^*) = D + b$.\n\nWe now analyze identifiability cases.\n\nCase $1$: Single steady state, measurements $(S^*, X^*)$, known $D$, $S_{\\mathrm{in}}$, $Y_{X/S}$, and $b$.\n\nFrom above, the only equation relating $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$ to the data is\n$$\n\\mu_{\\max}\\, \\frac{S^*}{K_s + S^*} = D + b.\n$$\nThis is one equation in two unknowns, so the parameter pair $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$ is not uniquely determined. Indeed, one can solve for $\\mu_{\\max}$ in terms of $K_s$ (or vice versa):\n$$\n\\mu_{\\max} = (D + b)\\, \\frac{K_s + S^*}{S^*}.\n$$\nFor any choice of $K_s > 0$, this yields a corresponding $\\mu_{\\max} > 0$ that satisfies the equation. Hence the parameter set is non-identifiable from a single steady state, regardless of whether $X^*$ is also measured. This establishes degeneracy when only $S^*$ is observed at a single steady state, and shows that $X^*$ at that same steady state does not resolve it.\n\nCase $2$: Multiple steady states at distinct dilution rates, measuring only $S^*$ at each.\n\nConsider two steady states indexed by $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$, with known $D_i$ and observed $S^*_i \\in (0, S_{\\mathrm{in}})$, and known $b$. The biomass balance at each steady state yields the pair of equations\n$$\nD_1 + b = \\mu_{\\max}\\, \\frac{S^*_1}{K_s + S^*_1}, \\qquad\nD_2 + b = \\mu_{\\max}\\, \\frac{S^*_2}{K_s + S^*_2}.\n$$\nAssuming $S^*_1 \\neq S^*_2$, we can solve these two equations for the two unknowns $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$. Eliminating $\\mu_{\\max}$ by taking the ratio gives\n$$\n\\frac{D_1 + b}{D_2 + b} = \\frac{S^*_1}{K_s + S^*_1}\\,\\Big/\\,\\frac{S^*_2}{K_s + S^*_2} = \\frac{S^*_1\\,(K_s + S^*_2)}{S^*_2\\,(K_s + S^*_1)}.\n$$\nCross-multiplying and rearranging to isolate $K_s$ leads to\n$$\n\\left((D_1 + b)\\, S^*_2 - (D_2 + b)\\, S^*_1\\right) K_s = (D_2 - D_1)\\, S^*_1 S^*_2,\n$$\nso provided the coefficient on $K_s$ is nonzero, we obtain\n$$\nK_s = \\frac{(D_2 - D_1)\\, S^*_1 S^*_2}{(D_1 + b)\\, S^*_2 - (D_2 + b)\\, S^*_1}.\n$$\nThen $\\mu_{\\max}$ follows from either steady-state equation:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\max} = (D_1 + b)\\, \\frac{K_s + S^*_1}{S^*_1}.\n$$\nThus, generically (i.e., except on a measure-zero set where the denominator vanishes, which corresponds to a special degeneracy when $(D_i, S^*_i)$ happen to satisfy $(D_1 + b) S^*_2 = (D_2 + b) S^*_1$), two distinct steady states with distinct $S^*$ values identify $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$ uniquely. With more than two distinct steady states, the system is overdetermined and, in the structural (noise-free) sense, still yields a unique parameter pair if the data are generated by the model.\n\nNote on the purported scaling symmetry: A claimed invariance $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s) \\mapsto (c\\,\\mu_{\\max}, c\\,K_s)$ would change the growth function to\n$$\n\\mu'(S) = c\\,\\mu_{\\max}\\, \\frac{S}{c\\,K_s + S},\n$$\nwhich is not equal to $\\mu(S)$ for general $S > 0$ unless $c = 1$. Therefore no such scaling symmetry prevents identifiability when multiple distinct $S^*$ values are available.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Correct. A single steady state provides only the constraint $\\mu(S^*) = D + b$, which is one equation in two unknowns $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$. Measuring $X^*$ at that same steady state does not introduce an additional equation involving $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$, because the substrate balance reduces to a relation among $(S^*, X^*, D, S_{\\mathrm{in}}, Y_{X/S}, b)$ that is independent of $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$. At least $2$ distinct steady states (e.g., at different $D$ values that yield different $S^*$) are required to identify both parameters.\n\nB. Correct. With only $S^*$ observed at one steady state, the relation $\\mu_{\\max} S^*/(K_s + S^*) = D + b$ admits infinitely many $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$ pairs, establishing degeneracy.\n\nC. Incorrect. As argued for option A, the additional measurement of $X^*$ at a single steady state does not add an independent constraint on $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$; it constrains $(S^*, X^*, D, S_{\\mathrm{in}}, Y_{X/S}, b)$ but not the kinetic parameters separately.\n\nD. Correct. Two distinct steady states with distinct $S^*$ values and known $D$ and $b$ yield two independent equations in $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s)$, from which both parameters are generically uniquely determined. Measuring only $S^*$ suffices in this case.\n\nE. Incorrect. There is no nontrivial scaling symmetry $(\\mu_{\\max}, K_s) \\mapsto (c\\,\\mu_{\\max}, c\\,K_s)$ that leaves $\\mu(S)$ invariant for general $S$, so multiple distinct steady states break any such degeneracy and permit identification as in case $2$.",

Substituting this into equation (1):\n$\\delta(1-s^{\\star}) = 0$. Since $D > 0$ and $\\mu_{\\max} > 0$, we have $\\delta > 0$, which implies $s^{\\star} = 1$.\nThe washout equilibrium is $(s^{\\star}, x^{\\star})_W = (1, 0)$. This point is always feasible as $s^{\\star} > 0$ and $x^{\\star} \\ge 0$.\n\n**Case 2: Coexistence Equilibrium**\n$x^{\\star} \\neq 0$. This requires the other factor in equation (2) to be zero:\n$\\frac{s^{\\star}}{\\kappa + s^{\\star}} = \\delta \\implies s^{\\star} = \\delta(\\kappa + s^{\\star}) \\implies s^{\\star}(1-\\delta) = \\delta\\kappa \\implies s^{\\star} = \\frac{\\delta\\kappa}{1-\\delta}$.\nFor feasibility, $s^{\\star} \\ge 0$. Since $\\delta > 0$ and $\\kappa > 0$, we must have $1-\\delta > 0$, so $0 < \\delta < 1$.\nNow we find $x^{\\star}$ by substituting $\\frac{s^{\\star}}{\\kappa + s^{\\star}} = \\delta$ into equation (1):\n$\\delta(1-s^{\\star}) - x^{\\star}\\delta = 0 \\implies 1-s^{\\star}-x^{\\star} = 0 \\implies x^{\\star} = 1-s^{\\star}$.\nThis reveals a simple stoichiometric relationship: the total amount of substrate (available, $s$, and converted to biomass, $x$) is conserved and equals the inlet concentration in dimensionless terms.\nSubstituting the expression for $s^{\\star}$:\n$x^{\\star} = 1 - \\frac{\\delta\\kappa}{1-\\delta} = \\frac{1-\\delta-\\delta\\kappa}{1-\\delta} = \\frac{1 - \\delta(1+\\kappa)}{1-\\delta}$.\nFor feasibility, $x^{\\star} \\ge 0$. Since $1-\\delta > 0$, we need $1 - \\delta(1+\\kappa) \\ge 0$, which implies $\\delta \\le \\frac{1}{1+\\kappa}$.\nThus, the coexistence equilibrium $(s^{\\star}, x^{\\star})_C = \\left(\\frac{\\delta\\kappa}{1-\\delta}, \\frac{1-\\delta(1+\\kappa)}{1-\\delta}\\right)$ is feasible for $0 < \\delta \\le \\frac{1}{1+\\kappa}$.\n\n**Linear Stability and Bifurcation**\nThe stability of the equilibria is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$:\n$$\nJ(s,x) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}(\\frac{ds}{d\\tau}) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\frac{ds}{d\\tau}) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}(\\frac{dx}{d\\tau}) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\frac{dx}{d\\tau}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\delta - x \\frac{\\kappa}{(\\kappa+s)^2} & -\\frac{s}{\\kappa+s} \\\\ x \\frac{\\kappa}{(\\kappa+s)^2} & \\frac{s}{\\kappa+s} - \\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n**Stability of Washout Equilibrium $(1,0)$:**\n$$\nJ(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\delta & -\\frac{1}{\\kappa+1} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{\\kappa+1} - \\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = -\\delta$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{1+\\kappa} - \\delta$.\nSince $\\delta > 0$, $\\lambda_1$ is always negative. The stability depends on $\\lambda_2$.\n- If $\\delta > \\frac{1}{1+\\kappa}$, then $\\lambda_2 < 0$, and the washout equilibrium is stable.\n- If $\\delta < \\frac{1}{1+\\kappa}$, then $\\lambda_2 > 0$, and the washout equilibrium is unstable.\n\n**Stability of Coexistence Equilibrium:**\nIn the feasible region $0 < \\delta < \\frac{1}{1+\\kappa}$, the Jacobian evaluated at the coexistence point has trace $\\text{tr}(J) < 0$ and determinant $\\det(J) > 0$. This can be shown by substituting the expressions for $s^{\\star}$ and $x^{\\star}$ into $J$. An equilibrium is stable if all eigenvalues have negative real parts, which is guaranteed if $\\text{tr}(J) < 0$ and $\\det(J) > 0$ for a $2 \\times 2$ system. Therefore, the coexistence equilibrium is stable whenever it is feasible.\n\n**Bifurcation Analysis:**\nA qualitative change in the system's behavior occurs at the critical value $\\delta_c = \\frac{1}{1+\\kappa}$.\n- For $\\delta > \\delta_c$, the only feasible equilibrium is washout $(1,0)$, which is stable. All trajectories lead to washout.\n- For $\\delta < \\delta_c$, the washout equilibrium $(1,0)$ is unstable, and the coexistence equilibrium $(s^{\\star}, x^{\\star})_C$ is feasible and stable. All trajectories with $x(0)>0$ approach the coexistence state.\n- At $\\delta = \\delta_c$, the coexistence equilibrium collides with the washout equilibrium: $s^{\\star}(\\delta_c)=1, x^{\\star}(\\delta_c)=0$. The two equilibria exchange stability. This is a classic transcritical bifurcation. The system switches from a state where biomass is washed out to a state where it can be sustained.\n\n### Task C: Computational Bifurcation Data Generation\n\nBased on the analysis in Part B, we can derive the formulas needed for the computation.\n\n1.  **Critical Control Value $\\delta_c$**:\n    As derived, the critical value of the control parameter $\\delta$ is:\n    $$ \\delta_c = \\frac{1}{1+\\kappa} $$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Biomass $x^{\\star}$**:\n    The problem asks for the equilibrium biomass $x^{\\star}$ at two sampling points, $\\delta_1 = \\delta_c/2$ and $\\delta_2 = (9/10)\\delta_c$. Both values are less than $\\delta_c$, so the stable coexistence equilibrium is the relevant one.\n    The formula for the coexistence biomass is $x^{\\star}(\\delta) = \\frac{1 - \\delta(1+\\kappa)}{1-\\delta}$.\n    \n    At $\\delta_1 = \\frac{\\delta_c}{2} = \\frac{1}{2(1+\\kappa)}$:\n    $$ x^{\\star}(\\delta_1) = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2(1+\\kappa)}(1+\\kappa)}{1 - \\frac{1}{2(1+\\kappa)}} = \\frac{1 - 1/2}{\\frac{2(1+\\kappa)-1}{2(1+\\kappa)}} = \\frac{1/2}{\\frac{1+2\\kappa}{2(1+\\kappa)}} = \\frac{1+\\kappa}{1+2\\kappa} $$\n    \n    At $\\delta_2 = \\frac{9}{10}\\delta_c = \\frac{9}{10(1+\\kappa)}$:\n    $$ x^{\\star}(\\delta_2) = \\frac{1 - \\frac{9}{10(1+\\kappa)}(1+\\kappa)}{1 - \\frac{9}{10(1+\\kappa)}} = \\frac{1 - 9/10}{\\frac{10(1+\\kappa)-9}{10(1+\\kappa)}} = \\frac{1/10}{\\frac{1+10\\kappa}{10(1+\\kappa)}} = \\frac{1+\\kappa}{1+10\\kappa} $$\n\n3.  **Stability of Washout Equilibrium at $\\delta_c \\pm \\varepsilon$**:\n    The stability of the washout equilibrium is determined by the sign of its second eigenvalue, $\\lambda_2 = \\delta_c - \\delta$. The equilibrium is stable if $\\lambda_2 < 0$.\n    - **Below $\\delta_c$**: At $\\delta = \\delta_c - \\varepsilon$ (with $\\varepsilon>0$), we have $\\lambda_2 = \\delta_c - (\\delta_c - \\varepsilon) = \\varepsilon > 0$. The equilibrium is unstable. Thus, `stable_below` is `False`.\n    - **Above $\\delta_c$**: At $\\delta = \\delta_c + \\varepsilon$ (with $\\varepsilon>0$), we have $\\lambda_2 = \\delta_c - (\\delta_c + \\varepsilon) = -\\varepsilon < 0$. The equilibrium is stable. Thus, `stable_above` is `True`.\n    These results are independent of the specific value of $\\kappa$.\n\nThe following code implements these derived formulas to generate the required data for the given test suite.",
