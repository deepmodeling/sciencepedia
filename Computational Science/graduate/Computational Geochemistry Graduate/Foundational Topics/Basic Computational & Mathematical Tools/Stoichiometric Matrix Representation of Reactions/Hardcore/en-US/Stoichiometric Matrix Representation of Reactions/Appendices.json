In computational geochemistry, the stoichiometric matrix $S$ is defined with rows indexed by chemical species and columns indexed by reactions, where the entry $S_{i,j}$ is the signed stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ in reaction $j$ (positive for production, negative for consumption). The matrix rank $\\mathrm{rank}(S)$ is the number of linearly independent reaction columns.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem that passes all validation criteria. It is scientifically grounded in computational geochemistry, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. Therefore, a complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the change in rank of the stoichiometric matrix for a chemical reaction when the set of basis species is expanded to include the solvent, water. The reaction is the precipitation of silica from aqueous silicic acid:\n$$ \\mathrm{H_4SiO_4} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{SiO_2}(s) + 2\\,\\mathrm{H_2O} $$\nThe stoichiometric matrix $S$ is defined such that its rows correspond to chemical species and its columns to reactions. An entry $S_{i,j}$ represents the stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ in reaction $j$. By convention, coefficients are negative for reactants (consumed) and positive for products (produced).\n\nFirst, we consider the reduced species set that excludes water: $(\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4}(\\mathrm{aq}),\\,\\mathrm{SiO_2}(s))$. There is only one reaction in the system, so the stoichiometric matrix $S_{\\mathrm{excl}}$ will have one column. The number of rows is equal to the number of species, which is $2$.\nThe species are ordered as follows:\nRow $1$: $\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4}(\\mathrm{aq})$\nRow $2$: $\\mathrm{SiO_2}(s)$\n\nIn the given reaction, one mole of $\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4}$ is consumed. Thus, the coefficient for the first species is $-1$. One mole of $\\mathrm{SiO_2}(s)$ is produced. Thus, the coefficient for the second species is $+1$. The resulting stoichiometric matrix, $S_{\\mathrm{excl}}$, is a $2 \\times 1$ matrix:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{excl}} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe problem defines the rank of $S$, $\\mathrm{rank}(S)$, as the number of linearly independent reaction columns. The matrix $S_{\\mathrm{excl}}$ has only one column. Since this column is not the zero vector, it forms a linearly independent set of size $1$. Therefore, the rank of $S_{\\mathrm{excl}}$ is $1$.\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(S_{\\mathrm{excl}}) = 1 $$\n\nNext, we consider the augmented species set that includes water: $(\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4}(\\mathrm{aq}),\\,\\mathrm{SiO_2}(s),\\,\\mathrm{H_2O}(\\ell))$. Again, there is only one reaction, so the stoichiometric matrix $S_{\\mathrm{incl}}$ will have one column. The number of species is now $3$, so the matrix will have three rows.\nThe species are ordered as follows:\nRow $1$: $\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4}(\\mathrm{aq})$\nRow $2$: $\\mathrm{SiO_2}(s)$\nRow $3$: $\\mathrm{H_2O}(\\ell)$\n\nFrom the reaction equation, one mole of $\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4}$ is consumed (coefficient $-1$), one mole of $\\mathrm{SiO_2}(s)$ is produced (coefficient $+1$), and two moles of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ are produced (coefficient $+2$). The resulting stoichiometric matrix, $S_{\\mathrm{incl}}$, is a $3 \\times 1$ matrix:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{incl}} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSimilar to the previous case, the matrix $S_{\\mathrm{incl}}$ consists of a single non-zero column vector. This single vector is, by definition, linearly independent. Thus, the number of linearly independent columns is $1$. The rank of $S_{\\mathrm{incl}}$ is $1$.\n$$ \\mathrm{rank}(S_{\\mathrm{incl}}) = 1 $$\n\nThe problem asks for the change in rank, $\\Delta r$, defined as:\n$$ \\Delta r \\equiv \\mathrm{rank}(S_{\\mathrm{incl}}) - \\mathrm{rank}(S_{\\mathrm{excl}}) $$\nSubstituting the computed ranks:\n$$ \\Delta r = 1 - 1 = 0 $$\nThe inclusion of the solvent, water, as an explicit species in the basis set increases the dimension of the species space (adds a row to the stoichiometric matrix) but does not change the number of independent reactions (the number of columns). Since the rank is determined by the number of independent reactions (columns), the rank remains unchanged.",

You will construct a multi-column stoichiometric matrix and learn how to handle spectator species, which are ubiquitous in geochemical models but do not participate in reactions.

The solution proceeds.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nA stoichiometric matrix $S$ is constructed, where the entry $S_{ij}$ represents the stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ in reaction $j$. The matrix has $m=6$ rows for the species $(\\mathrm{H^+}, \\mathrm{OH^-}, \\mathrm{HCO_3^-}, \\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}, \\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}, \\mathrm{Na^+})$ and $n=3$ columns for the reactions (i), (ii), and (iii).\n\n**Column 1 (Reaction i: $\\mathrm{H^+} + \\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$):**\n- $\\mathrm{H^+}$ (species $1$): reactant, coefficient is $-1$.\n- $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ (species $2$): spectator, coefficient is $0$.\n- $\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$ (species $3$): product, coefficient is $+1$.\n- $\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}$ (species $4$): reactant, coefficient is $-1$.\n- $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ (species $5$): spectator, coefficient is $0$.\n- $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ (species $6$): spectator, coefficient is $0$.\nThe first column vector is $c_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0  1  -1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\n\n**Column 2 (Reaction ii: $\\mathrm{CaCO_3(s)} + \\mathrm{H^+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} + \\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$):**\n- $\\mathrm{H^+}$ (species $1$): reactant, coefficient is $-1$.\n- $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ (species $2$): spectator, coefficient is $0$.\n- $\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$ (species $3$): product, coefficient is $+1$.\n- $\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}$ (species $4$): spectator, coefficient is $0$.\n- $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ (species $5$): product, coefficient is $+1$.\n- $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ (species $6$): spectator, coefficient is $0$.\nThe second column vector is $c_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0  1  0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\n\n**Column 3 (Reaction iii: $\\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H^+} + \\mathrm{OH^-}$):**\n- $\\mathrm{H^+}$ (species $1$): product, coefficient is $+1$.\n- $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ (species $2$): product, coefficient is $+1$.\n- $\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$ (species $3$): spectator, coefficient is $0$.\n- $\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}$ (species $4$): spectator, coefficient is $0$.\n- $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ (species $5$): spectator, coefficient is $0$.\n- $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ (species $6$): spectator, coefficient is $0$.\nThe third column vector is $c_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  0  0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\n\nCombining these columns, the stoichiometric matrix $S$ of size $6 \\times 3$ is:\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1  -1  1 \\\\\n0  0  1 \\\\\n1  1  0 \\\\\n-1  0  0 \\\\\n0  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the rank of $S$, which is the number of linearly independent columns. We seek a non-trivial solution $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ to the equation $a_1 c_1 + a_2 c_2 + a_3 c_3 = \\mathbf{0}$:\n$$\na_1 \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + a_2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + a_3 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis vector equation corresponds to the following system of linear equations:\n1. $-a_1 - a_2 + a_3 = 0$\n2. $a_3 = 0$\n3. $a_1 + a_2 = 0$\n4. $-a_1 = 0$\n5. $a_2 = 0$\n6. $0 = 0$\n\nFrom equation (4), $a_1 = 0$. From equation (5), $a_2 = 0$. From equation (2), $a_3 = 0$. This is the only possible solution. Since the only solution is the trivial solution $a_1=a_2=a_3=0$, the column vectors are linearly independent. The number of linearly independent columns is $3$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{rank}(S) = 3$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The stoichiometric matrix $S$ is $6\\times 3$ with rank $3$; the all-zero row for $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ does not change the rank, and zero entries for spectator species in particular reactions do not alter rank unless they induce linear dependence among columns.**\n- The matrix $S$ is indeed $6 \\times 3$. Correct.\n- The rank of $S$ is $3$. Correct, as derived above.\n- The all-zero row for $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ corresponds to a species that is a spectator in all reactions. The rank of a matrix is the dimension of its row space (or column space). An all-zero row vector is linearly dependent on any other set of vectors and does not increase the dimension of the row space. Removing this all-zero row results in a $5 \\times 3$ matrix whose rank is also $3$. Thus, the all-zero row does not change the rank. This reasoning is correct.\n- Zero entries for spectator species in particular reactions are simply numerical values in the column vectors. The rank of the matrix is determined by the linear independence of these vectors as a whole. The presence of zeros is a necessary element of the vector definitions, but rank is only reduced if these specific zero and non-zero values cause one or more columns to become a linear combination of the others. This statement is a correct description of the principles of linear algebra.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The stoichiometric matrix $S$ has rank $2$ because reactions (i) and (ii) act on the same linear combination of species, and the all-zero $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ row reduces the rank by one.**\n- \"has rank $2$\": Incorrect. The rank is $3$.\n- \"reactions (i) and (ii) act on the same linear combination of species\": This phrasing is vague, but in the context of the matrix, it implies that columns $c_1$ and $c_2$ are linearly dependent. They are not; $c_1 \\neq k \\cdot c_2$ for any scalar $k$.\n- \"the all-zero $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ row reduces the rank by one\": Incorrect. An all-zero row does not reduce the rank. The rank of the matrix without this row is $3$; with this row, the rank remains $3$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The stoichiometric matrix $S$ has rank $3$ only if $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ is excluded; including $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ raises the rank to $4$ due to the autoprotolysis reaction.**\n- \"including $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ raises the rank to $4$\": Incorrect. The maximum rank of a $6 \\times 3$ matrix is $\\min(6, 3) = 3$. The rank can never be $4$.\n- \"rank $3$ only if $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ is excluded\": Incorrect. As shown in the derivation, the rank is $3$ *with* $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ included.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The rank equals the number of reactions minus the number of spectator species, so here $\\mathrm{rank}(S)=3-2=1$.**\n- \"The rank equals the number of reactions minus the number of spectator species\": This formula is not a valid principle of linear algebra or chemistry. The concept of rank is based on linear independence, not a simple subtraction of counts. If \"spectator species\" refers to the single global spectator $\\mathrm{Na^+}$, the formula would give $3-1=2$, which is also wrong.\n- \"$\\mathrm{rank}(S)=3-2=1$\": Incorrect. The rank is $3$. The calculation is based on a false premise and yields a wrong result.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

I will proceed to the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\nThe evolution of the species amounts vector $\\mathbf{n}(t)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}(t) = \\mathbf{n}_0 + S\\,\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the given parameterization for the reaction extent, $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(t) = t\\,\\mathbf{p}$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}(t) = \\mathbf{n}_0 + S\\,(t\\,\\mathbf{p}) = \\mathbf{n}_0 + t\\,(S\\,\\mathbf{p})\n$$\nLet us define a vector $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{7}$ as the product of the stoichiometric matrix $S$ and the direction vector $\\mathbf{p}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} = S\\,\\mathbf{p}\n$$\nThe vector $\\mathbf{v}$ represents the net change in species amounts per unit of the parameter $t$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1  0  0  0 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}1  -1  0  0 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}0  \\phantom{-}1  0  \\phantom{-}1 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}1  \\phantom{-}1  \\phantom{-}1  0 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}0  \\phantom{-}0  \\phantom{-}1  0 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}0  \\phantom{-}0  \\phantom{-}0  \\phantom{-}1 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}0  \\phantom{-}0  \\phantom{-}0  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.6 \\\\ 0.3 \\\\ 0.2 \\\\ 0.5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(-1)(0.6) + (0)(0.3) + (0)(0.2) + (0)(0.5) \\\\\n(\\phantom{-}1)(0.6) + (-1)(0.3) + (0)(0.2) + (0)(0.5) \\\\\n(\\phantom{-}0)(0.6) + (\\phantom{-}1)(0.3) + (0)(0.2) + (\\phantom{-}1)(0.5) \\\\\n(\\phantom{-}1)(0.6) + (\\phantom{-}1)(0.3) + (\\phantom{-}1)(0.2) + (0)(0.5) \\\\\n(\\phantom{-}0)(0.6) + (\\phantom{-}0)(0.3) + (\\phantom{-}1)(0.2) + (0)(0.5) \\\\\n(\\phantom{-}0)(0.6) + (\\phantom{-}0)(0.3) + (0)(0.2) + (\\phantom{-}1)(0.5) \\\\\n(\\phantom{-}0)(0.6) + (\\phantom{-}0)(0.3) + (0)(0.2) + (-1)(0.5)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-0.6 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}0.3 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}0.8 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}1.1 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}0.2 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}0.5 \\\\\n-0.5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe condition for feasibility is $\\mathbf{n}(t) \\succeq \\mathbf{0}$, which translates to a system of $7$ linear inequalities:\n$$\nn_i(t) = n_{0,i} + t v_i \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}\n$$\nWe solve each inequality for $t$. The form of the solution depends on the sign of $v_i$.\n\nFor species where $v_i  0$, the amount increases with $t$. The inequality is $t v_i \\ge -n_{0,i}$, which gives a lower bound on $t$: $t \\ge -\\frac{n_{0,i}}{v_i}$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Species $2$: $v_2 = 0.3$. $t \\ge -\\frac{0.001}{0.3} \\approx -0.003333...$\n    \\item Species $3$: $v_3 = 0.8$. $t \\ge -\\frac{0.0005}{0.8} = -0.000625$\n    \\item Species $4$: $v_4 = 1.1$. $t \\ge -\\frac{0.001}{1.1} \\approx -0.000909...$\n    \\item Species $5$: $v_5 = 0.2$. $t \\ge -\\frac{0.0002}{0.2} = -0.001$\n    \\item Species $6$: $v_6 = 0.5$. $t \\ge -\\frac{0.002}{0.5} = -0.004$\n\\end{itemize}\nTo satisfy all these lower bounds simultaneously, $t$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum of these values.\n$$\nt_{\\min} = \\max(-0.003333..., -0.000625, -0.000909..., -0.001, -0.004) = -0.000625\n$$\nThe constraint that sets this lower limit is for species $3$. Thus, at $t = t_{\\min}$, the amount of species $3$ ($\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}$) will be zero.\n\nFor species where $v_i  0$, the amount decreases with $t$. The inequality is $n_{0,i} \\ge -t v_i$. Since $v_i$ is negative, $-v_i$ is positive, so we can divide without flipping the inequality sign: $t \\le \\frac{n_{0,i}}{-v_i} = -\\frac{n_{0,i}}{v_i}$. This gives an upper bound on $t$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Species $1$: $v_1 = -0.6$. $t \\le -\\frac{0.010}{-0.6} = \\frac{0.010}{0.6} \\approx 0.016666...$\n    \\item Species $7$: $v_7 = -0.5$. $t \\le -\\frac{0.001}{-0.5} = \\frac{0.001}{0.5} = 0.002$\n\\end{itemize}\nTo satisfy all these upper bounds simultaneously, $t$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of these values.\n$$\nt_{\\max} = \\min(0.016666..., 0.002) = 0.002\n$$\nThe constraint that sets this upper limit is for species $7$. Thus, at $t = t_{\\max}$, the amount of species $7$ ($\\mathrm{CaCO_3(s)}$) will be zero.\n\nThe feasible range for the parameter $t$ is the closed interval $[t_{\\min}, t_{\\max}] = [-0.000625, 0.002]$.\n\nThe problem asks for $t_{\\min}$ and $t_{\\max}$ to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$t_{\\min} = -0.000625$ becomes $-0.0006250$.\n$t_{\\max} = 0.002$ becomes $0.002000$.\n\nThe species index whose nonnegativity constraint is active at $t_{\\min}$ is $3$.\nThe species index whose nonnegativity constraint is active at $t_{\\max}$ is $7$.\n\nFinal values to be reported are:\n$t_{\\min} = -0.0006250$\n$t_{\\max} = 0.002000$\nIndex at $t_{\\min} = 3$\nIndex at $t_{\\max} = 7$\nThe units of $t$ are moles, as per the problem statement \"Express the final extents in mol.\" and the construction $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(t) = t \\mathbf{p}$.",
