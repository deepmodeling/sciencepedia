Report $S$ rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically sound. The governing equation is the one-dimensional advection-diffusion-reaction equation, a fundamental and widely used model in environmental and earth system sciences for describing solute transport. The concepts of dimensional analysis and characteristic scales are standard tools for analyzing such equations. All required parameters ($L, U, D, k$) are provided, and their values are physically realistic for a riverine system. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins by determining the dimensions of the relevant parameters. Let $\\mathrm{L}$ denote length and $\\mathrm{T}$ denote time.\n- Reach length $L$: $[L] = \\mathrm{L}$\n- Flow speed $U$: $[U] = \\mathrm{L\\,T}^{-1}$\n- Dispersion coefficient $D$: $[D] = \\mathrm{L}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1}$\n- Decay rate constant $k$: $[k] = \\mathrm{T}^{-1}$\n\nWe construct the characteristic time scales by considering the physical meaning of each process and balancing terms in the governing equation. A characteristic time scale for a process is the time required for that process to cause a significant change in the system over a characteristic length scale, which is the reach length $L$.\n\n**1. Advection Time Scale ($T_A$)**\nAdvection is the transport of solute by the bulk flow. The characteristic advective time scale, $T_A$, is the time it takes for a parcel of water to travel the entire length of the reach, $L$, at the mean flow speed, $U$. Based on the fundamental definition of velocity (distance/time), we have:\n$$\nT_A = \\frac{L}{U}\n$$\nThe dimensions are $[\\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{L\\,T}^{-1}}] = \\mathrm{T}$, which is consistent.\n\n**2. Diffusion Time Scale ($T_D$)**\nDiffusion (or more accurately, longitudinal dispersion in a river context) is the process by which solute spreads out from regions of high concentration to low concentration. The characteristic time for this process, $T_D$, over the length scale $L$ can be derived by a scaling analysis of the pure diffusion equation, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}$. Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a characteristic concentration. The terms scale as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} \\sim \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{T_D} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} \\sim D \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{L^2}\n$$\nFor the process to be significant, these two scales must be of the same order of magnitude:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{T_D} \\sim D \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{L^2} \\implies T_D = \\frac{L^2}{D}\n$$\nThe dimensions are $[\\frac{\\mathrm{L}^2}{\\mathrm{L}^2\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1}}] = \\mathrm{T}$, which is consistent. This time scale represents the time required for diffusive effects to become important across the entire length of the reach.\n\n**3. Reaction Time Scale ($T_R$)**\nThe first-order reaction describes the decay of the solute. The characteristic time scale for reaction, $T_R$, is the time over which a significant fraction of the solute decays. This is derived from the pure decay equation, $\\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC$. The solution is $C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$, where the time constant of the exponential decay is $1/k$. Therefore, the characteristic time scale is:\n$$\nT_R = \\frac{1}{k}\n$$\nThis represents the e-folding lifetime of the solute. The dimensions are $[\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{T}^{-1}}] = \\mathrm{T}$, which is consistent.\n\n### Computation of Time Scales and Dominance Spread\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical values of these time scales using the provided parameters. First, we ensure all values are in consistent SI units (meters and seconds).\n- $L = 20\\,\\mathrm{km} = 2.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $U = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $D = 40\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $k = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe time scales are computed as follows:\n$$\nT_A = \\frac{L}{U} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.3\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{20}{3} \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 6.6667 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\nT_D = \\frac{L^2}{D} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{40\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m}^2}{40\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 1.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\nT_R = \\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{1}{2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 0.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s} = 5.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\nNow, we compare their magnitudes to determine the largest and smallest time scales. A smaller time scale indicates a faster, more dominant process over the given length scale.\n- $T_A \\approx 6.67 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $T_R = 5.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $T_D = 1.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nComparing these values, we find:\n- Smallest time scale: $T_{\\mathrm{min}} = T_A = \\frac{20}{3} \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- Largest time scale: $T_{\\mathrm{max}} = T_D = 1.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nThis indicates that over the $20\\,\\mathrm{km}$ reach, advection is the fastest process, followed by reaction, and dispersion is the slowest process.\n\nThe dominance spread $S$ is the ratio of the largest to the smallest characteristic time scale:\n$$\nS = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{max}}}{T_{\\mathrm{min}}} = \\frac{T_D}{T_A} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s}}{\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^4}{0.3}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^7) \\times 0.3}{2.0 \\times 10^4}\n$$\n$$\nS = \\frac{0.3 \\times 10^3}{2.0} = \\frac{300}{2} = 150\n$$\nThe value of $S$ is exactly $150$. The problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures. Therefore, we write $150$ as $150.0$.",

This leaves two possibilities for the leading-order balance: dispersion-advection or dispersion-reaction.\n\nLet's evaluate the dimensionless group that compares the advection and reaction terms relative to dispersion. The ratio of the advection term's magnitude to the reaction term's magnitude is $(U/\\delta) / k = U/(k\\delta)$. The parameter that determines the nature of the balance is the ratio of their characteristic length scales.

This indicates that within the front, the magnitude of the advection term is smaller than that of the reaction and dispersion terms. Therefore, the dominant balance that sets the front width $\\delta$ is between dispersion and reaction.\n$$\nD\\frac{\\Delta C}{\\delta^2} \\sim k\\,\\Delta C\n$$\nWe can cancel $\\Delta C$ and solve for $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{\\delta^2} \\sim k \\implies \\delta^2 \\sim \\frac{D}{k}\n$$\nThus, the leading-order expression for the internal front width is:\n$$\n\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the given parameter regime. The problem specifies $\\mathrm{Pe} \\gg 1$ and $\\mathrm{Da} \\gg 1$. We can calculate these for the given set of parameters:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{D} = \\frac{(5.00 \\times 10^{-6})(1.00)}{1.00 \\times 10^{-8}} = 500\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Da} = \\frac{kL}{U} = \\frac{(2.50 \\times 10^{-2})(1.00)}{5.00 \\times 10^{-6}} = 5000\n$$\nBoth dimensionless numbers are indeed large. The condition $U^2/(kD) \\ll 1$ is equivalent to $\\mathrm{Pe}/\\mathrm{Da} \\ll 1$, which holds true since $500/5000 = 0.1 \\ll 1$. This confirms that the appropriate asymptotic limit is one where reaction is fast compared to both advection and dispersion on their respective scales, and the front structure is set by the local balance of dispersion and reaction. Notably, the front width $\\delta$ in this limit is independent of the advection velocity $U$ and the system length $L$.\n\nNow, we evaluate $\\delta$ numerically:\n$$\n\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.50 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}} = \\sqrt{0.400 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2} = \\sqrt{4.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta = \\sqrt{4.00} \\times \\sqrt{10^{-7}}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-3.5}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\times \\sqrt{10}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\n\\delta \\approx 2.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\times 3.162277... \\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 6.324555... \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in millimeters ($1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\delta \\approx (6.324555... \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.6324555...\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\delta \\approx 0.632\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$",
