The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any scientific principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Debye Screening Parameter, $\\kappa$\nThe derivation begins with the Poisson equation from electrostatics, which relates the electrostatic potential $\\phi$ to the local net charge density $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the medium.\n\nThe charge density $\\rho$ is determined by the distribution of ions in the electrolyte. For an ionic species $i$ with charge number $z_i$ and bulk number concentration $n_{i,0}$, its local number concentration $n_i$ at a point with potential $\\phi$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\nn_i(\\mathbf{r}) = n_{i,0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_i e \\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe total local charge density is the sum over all ionic species:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_i z_i e n_i(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_i z_i e n_{i,0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_i e \\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\nCombining the Poisson equation and the Boltzmann distribution for charge density gives the full Poisson-Boltzmann equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{e}{\\epsilon} \\sum_i z_i n_{i,0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_i e \\phi}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the linearized framework. This is the Debye-Hückel approximation, which is valid when the electrostatic potential energy is small compared to the thermal energy, i.e., $|z_i e \\phi| \\ll k_B T$. Under this condition, the exponential term can be approximated by the first two terms of its Taylor series expansion, $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_i e \\phi}{k_B T}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\frac{z_i e \\phi}{k_B T}\n$$\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for charge density:\n$$\n\\rho \\approx \\sum_i z_i e n_{i,0} \\left(1 - \\frac{z_i e \\phi}{k_B T}\\right) = e \\sum_i z_i n_{i,0} - \\frac{e^2 \\phi}{k_B T} \\sum_i z_i^2 n_{i,0}\n$$\nThe first term, $e \\sum_i z_i n_{i,0}$, represents the net charge density of the bulk solution, which is zero due to the principle of electroneutrality. Therefore, the expression for the charge density simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho \\approx - \\left( \\frac{e^2}{k_B T} \\sum_i z_i^2 n_{i,0} \\right) \\phi\n$$\n\nSubstituting this linearized charge density back into the Poisson equation gives the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\left[ - \\left( \\frac{e^2}{k_B T} \\sum_i z_i^2 n_{i,0} \\right) \\phi \\right] = \\left( \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon k_B T} \\sum_i z_i^2 n_{i,0} \\right) \\phi\n$$\nThis equation has the form $\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\kappa^2 \\phi$, where $\\kappa$ is the Debye screening parameter. By comparing the two forms, we identify $\\kappa^2$:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon k_B T} \\sum_i z_i^2 n_{i,0}\n$$\n\n### Relation to Ionic Strength, $I$\nThe ionic strength $I$ is defined in terms of molar concentrations $c_i$ as $I = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_i c_i z_i^2$. The number concentration $n_{i,0}$ (in units of $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$) is related to the molar concentration $c_i$ (in units of $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$) by $n_{i,0} = c_i N_A$, where $N_A$ is the Avogadro constant.\nSubstituting $n_{i,0} = c_i N_A$ into the expression for $\\kappa^2$:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{e^2 N_A}{\\epsilon k_B T} \\sum_i c_i z_i^2\n$$\nFrom the definition of ionic strength, we have $\\sum_i c_i z_i^2 = 2I$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\kappa^2$ yields the final expression relating $\\kappa$ to the ionic strength $I$:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{2 e^2 N_A I}{\\epsilon k_B T}\n$$\nThus, the Debye screening parameter is:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 e^2 N_A I}{\\epsilon k_B T}}\n$$\nThis expression depends on the ionic strength $I$ and fundamental constants, as required.\n\n### Unit Conversion for Ionic Strength\nThe provided ionic strength is $I = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. For consistency with the SI units used for all constants in the derivation, $I$ must be converted from $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ to $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. The conversion factor is $1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3$.\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{SI}} = 0.01\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{L}}{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\n\n### Calculation of the Debye Length, $\\lambda_D$\nThe Debye length is $\\lambda_D = \\kappa^{-1}$.

Since the Debye length is the inverse of the screening parameter, $\\lambda_D = \\kappa^{-1}$, its scaling with ionic strength is:\n$$\n\\lambda_D \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{I}}\n$$\nThis relationship is a fundamental result of the Debye-Hückel theory. It signifies that as the concentration of ions in the solution increases (higher $I$), the electrostatic field of any given ion is screened more effectively by its surrounding atmosphere of counter-ions. This increased screening occurs over a shorter distance, hence the Debye length $\\lambda_D$ decreases. Physically, $\\lambda_D$ is the characteristic distance over which significant electrostatic interactions persist; beyond this distance, the ion's potential has effectively decayed to zero.\n\nThis scaling is the physical basis for the Debye-Hückel limiting law for activity coefficients, $\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm} \\propto -\\sqrt{I}$, which describes the deviation from ideal behavior in dilute electrolyte solutions. The Davies equation, an empirical extension of Debye-Hückel theory for higher concentrations ($I \\lesssim 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$), modifies the model but retains the core dependence on $\\sqrt{I}$ at its low concentration limit. The term $\\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}}$ in the Davies equation reflects that the effective ionic radius becomes a significant fraction of the Debye length at higher concentrations, but the foundational concept of screening over the Debye length, which scales as $I^{-1/2}$, remains central.",

It presents a standard, solvable problem in computational geochemistry concerning the application of the Davies equation.\n\nThe calculation of the single-ion activity coefficient, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}}$, proceeds from an understanding of the Debye-Hückel theory and its empirical extensions.\n\n(i) Connection of the Debye-Hückel Limiting Law to Finite-Ionic-Strength Extensions\n\nThe starting point is the Debye-Hückel Limiting Law (DHLL), which describes the activity coefficient $\\gamma_i$ of an ion $i$ with charge $z_i$ in a solution of very low ionic strength $I$. The law is expressed using base-$10$ logarithms as:\n$$\n\\log_{10} \\gamma_i = -A z_i^2 \\sqrt{I}\n$$\nHere, $A$ is a constant that depends on the solvent's properties (dielectric constant, temperature) and fundamental constants. For water at $25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$), $A \\approx 0.509\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{1/2}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1/2}$. This law is derived by modeling ions as point charges and considering only long-range electrostatic interactions within a continuous dielectric medium.\n\nThe DHLL is a limiting law, accurate only as $I \\to 0$. At finite, non-zero ionic strengths, the model's assumption of point charges becomes untenable because real ions have finite size. An ion can only be approached by other ions up to a certain distance, the distance of closest approach, related to its ionic radius. This physical constraint is incorporated into the Extended Debye-Hückel equation:\n$$\n\\log_{10} \\gamma_i = - \\frac{A z_i^2 \\sqrt{I}}{1 + B a \\sqrt{I}}\n$$\nwhere $a$ is the effective hydrated radius of the ion and $B$ is another constant dependent on the solvent and temperature.\n\nThe Davies equation is an empirical modification of the Extended Debye-Hückel equation, particularly useful for ionic strengths up to approximately $0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}$. It simplifies the denominator by assuming the product $B a \\sqrt{I}$ can be approximated as $\\sqrt{I}$. This is equivalent to assuming an average effective ion size parameter such that $B a \\approx 1$. Furthermore, it adds a linear empirical term to account for other effects at higher concentrations, such as short-range ion-ion interactions and ion-solvent interactions (hydration effects).\n\n(ii) The Empirical Correction Proportional to $I$\n\nThe Davies equation is formulated as:\n$$\n\\log_{10} \\gamma_i = -A z_i^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}} - C I \\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the use of an empirical correction of the form $0.3I$, which implies the constant $C$ is approximately $0.3$. This linear term, $-0.3I$, acts as an empirical correction to the primary electrostatic term, $\\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}}$. While the primary term accounts for the electrostatic shielding modified by finite ion size, the linear term empirically corrects for a complex set of phenomena dominant at higher concentrations, often associated with a \"salting-out\" effect where the activity of the solvent is reduced, effectively increasing the activity of the solute ions. The negative sign in front of the $CI$ term inside the parenthesis means that this correction term increases the value of $\\log_{10} \\gamma_i$ (makes it less negative) compared to the simplified form without it, thus increasing the activity coefficient. This is a typical observation at moderate ionic strengths.\n\nThus, the specific expression for the single-ion activity coefficient to be used is:\n$$\n\\log_{10} \\gamma_i = -A z_i^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}} - 0.3 I \\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the sulfate ion, $\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}$, under the given conditions.\nThe provided parameters are:\n- Charge of sulfate ion, $z_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}} = -2$.

For any non-zero ionic strength, $\\log_{10} \\gamma_i < 0$, which implies $\\gamma_i < 1$.\n2.  The effect of non-ideality is independent of the sign of the charge (cation vs. anion), as it depends on $z_i^2$.\n3.  The magnitude of the deviation from ideality increases sharply with the magnitude of the charge.\n\nWe are asked to compare $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}}$ and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}}$.\n- For the potassium ion, $\\mathrm{K^+}$, the charge is $z_i = +1$, so $z_i^2 = 1$.\n- For the sulfate ion, $\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}$, the charge is $z_i = -2$, so $z_i^2 = 4$.\n\nAt a fixed ionic strength $I$, the term in the parentheses of the Davies equation is a constant. Let's call it $C(I)$.\n$$ C(I) = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1 + \\sqrt{I}} - bI \\right) $$\nThen, for our two ions:\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}} = -A (1)^2 C(I) = -A \\cdot C(I) $$\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}} = -A (-2)^2 C(I) = -A \\cdot 4 \\cdot C(I) $$\nFrom this, it is immediately apparent that:\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}} = 4 \\times \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}} $$\nSince $\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}}$ is a negative number, $\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}}$ will be a four times more negative number. A more negative logarithm corresponds to a smaller value of the number itself (e.g., $10^{-4} < 10^{-1}$). Therefore, we must have $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}} < \\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}}$.\n\nNow, we perform the quantitative calculation for $I = 0.10$:\n- Given: $T = 25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($A \\approx 0.509$), $I = 0.10$, $b = 0.3$.\n- Calculate the ionic strength dependent term:\n$$ \\sqrt{I} = \\sqrt{0.10} \\approx 0.3162 $$\n$$ C(I) = \\left( \\frac{0.3162}{1 + 0.3162} - (0.3)(0.10) \\right) = \\left( \\frac{0.3162}{1.3162} - 0.03 \\right) \\approx 0.2402 - 0.03 = 0.2102 $$\n- Calculate the activity coefficients:\n- For $\\mathrm{K^+}$ ($z_i = 1$):\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}} = -(0.509)(1)^2(0.2102) \\approx -0.1070 $$\n$$ \\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}} = 10^{-0.1070} \\approx 0.7816 \\approx 0.78 $$\n- For $\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}$ ($z_i = -2$):\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}} = -(0.509)(-2)^2(0.2102) = -(0.509)(4)(0.2102) \\approx -0.4280 $$\n$$ \\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}} = 10^{-0.4280} \\approx 0.3733 \\approx 0.37 $$\nThe theoretical expectation and the quantitative calculation are in complete agreement.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. At identical $I$, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}}$ is significantly smaller than $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}}$ primarily because of the $z_i^2$ scaling of electrostatic interactions; under the Davies equation at $I = 0.10$, one obtains $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}} \\approx 0.78$ and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}} \\approx 0.37$, with $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}}$ approximately four times more negative than $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}}$.**\n- **Justification:** Our derivation shows that $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}} \\approx 0.37$ is indeed significantly smaller than $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}} \\approx 0.78$. The primary reason for this is the $z_i^2$ term, which is $4$ for sulfate versus $1$ for potassium. This leads directly to the observation that $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}} \\approx 4 \\times \\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}}$. The numerical values cited in the option are precisely what we calculated using the standard Davies equation formulation. The statement is entirely consistent with theory and calculation.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. At identical $I$, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}}$ and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}}$ are nearly equal because the ionic strength $I$ already accounts for $z_i^2$, so species-specific charge effects cancel in single-ion activity coefficients.**\n- **Justification:** This statement contains a fundamental conceptual error. While the ionic strength $I = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_j c_j z_j^2$ does summarize the overall charge environment of the solution, the activity coefficient of a *specific ion i* ($\\gamma_i$) depends explicitly on its own charge, $z_i$, via the $-A z_i^2 f(I)$ term. This term does *not* cancel out. Our calculation shows the values are not nearly equal ($0.37$ vs. $0.78$).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The sign of $z_i$ controls $\\gamma_i$, so anions have larger $\\gamma_i$ than cations at the same $I$; hence $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}} > \\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}}$ at $I = 0.10$.**\n- **Justification:** This is incorrect. The Debye-Hückel theory and its extensions depend on $z_i^2$, the square of the charge. The sign of the charge is irrelevant. An ion with charge $+2$ and an ion with charge $-2$ would have the same $\\gamma_i$ in this model framework (ignoring other effects not in the Davies equation like ion size). The conclusion that $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}} > \\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}}$ is falsified by our calculation.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The leading dependence of $\\gamma_i$ at low to moderate $I$ is linear in $z_i$, not quadratic, implying $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}}$ is only about twice $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}}$ at $I = 0.10$, with ionic-size corrections dominating the difference.**\n- **Justification:** This statement fundamentally misrepresents the theory. The leading dependence is quadratic in charge ($z_i^2$), not linear. This is a direct consequence of the physical model of electrostatic potential. The assertion that $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}}$ would be twice $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{K^+}}$ is incorrect; it is four times greater in magnitude. While ionic size corrections exist (in the extended DH model, not the Davies equation), they do not dominate the $z_i^2$ effect, which is the primary driver of differences between ions of different charge magnitudes.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
