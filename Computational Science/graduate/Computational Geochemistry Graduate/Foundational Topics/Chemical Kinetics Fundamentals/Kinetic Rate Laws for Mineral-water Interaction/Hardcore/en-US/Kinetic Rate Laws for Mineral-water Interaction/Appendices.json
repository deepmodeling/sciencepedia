The definitions provided for Saturation Index ($\\mathrm{SI}$) and the saturation ratio ($\\Omega$) are standard in geochemistry. The values given for temperature, surface area, $\\mathrm{SI}$, and the intrinsic rate constant are physically realistic for a laboratory experiment. The problem is well-posed and self-contained; it provides all necessary information and asks for a derivation and calculation that directly follow from the given premises. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe total net rate of reaction, $R_{total}$, is the difference between the total forward rate (dissolution), $R_{fwd}$, and the total backward rate (precipitation), $R_{rev}$.\n$$R_{total} = R_{fwd} - R_{rev}$$\nAccording to Transition State Theory, the forward and reverse rates are related through the principle of detailed balance. The net rate can be expressed in terms of the forward rate and the Gibbs free energy of reaction, $\\Delta G_r$. The total forward rate is given by the product of the intrinsic rate constant per unit area, $k^0$, and the total reactive surface area, $A$.\n$$R_{fwd} = A k^{0}$$\nThe net rate is related to the forward rate by the thermodynamic driving force:\n$$R_{total} = R_{fwd} \\left(1 - \\frac{R_{rev}}{R_{fwd}}\\right)$$\nFrom the principle of detailed balance, the ratio of the reverse to forward rates is related to the Gibbs free energy of the reaction:\n$$\\frac{R_{rev}}{R_{fwd}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_r}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Substituting this into the net rate expression gives the general form of the TST rate law near equilibrium:\n$$R_{total} = A k^{0} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_r}{RT}\\right)\\right)$$\nThe problem requires deriving the rate law by linking it to $\\Omega$. The Gibbs free energy of reaction, $\\Delta G_r$, is related to the equilibrium constant, $K$, and the ion activity product, $Q$, through the fundamental thermodynamic relation:\n$$\\Delta G_r = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{Q}{K}\\right)$$\nThe saturation ratio, $\\Omega$, is defined as $\\Omega = Q/K$. Therefore, we can write $\\Delta G_r$ in terms of $\\Omega$:\n$$\\Delta G_r = RT \\ln(\\Omega)$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\Delta G_r$ into the TST rate equation:\n$$R_{total} = A k^{0} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{RT \\ln(\\Omega)}{RT}\\right)\\right)$$\nThe terms $RT$ in the exponent cancel, simplifying the expression significantly:\n$$R_{total} = A k^{0} \\left(1 - \\exp(\\ln(\\Omega))\\right)$$\nSince the exponential and natural logarithm functions are inverses, $\\exp(\\ln(\\Omega)) = \\Omega$. This yields the specific TST rate law for this system:\n$$R_{total} = A k^{0} (1 - \\Omega)$$\nA positive value for $R_{total}$ signifies net dissolution, while a negative value signifies net precipitation. Since the solution is undersaturated ($\\mathrm{SI}  0$), we expect $\\Omega  1$ and a positive (dissolution) rate.\n\nNext, we calculate the value of $\\Omega$ from the given Saturation Index, $\\mathrm{SI}$:\n$$\\mathrm{SI} = \\log_{10}(\\Omega)$$\nGiven $\\mathrm{SI} = -0.5$:\n$$-0.5 = \\log_{10}(\\Omega)$$\n$$\\Omega = 10^{-0.5}$$\nNow we have all the components to calculate the total dissolution rate, $R_{total}$. We substitute the given values for $A$, $k^0$, and the calculated value for $\\Omega$ into the derived rate law:\n-   $A = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$\n-   $k^{0} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$\n-   $\\Omega = 10^{-0.5}$\n\n$$R_{total} = (2.0\\,\\mathrm{m^2}) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (1 - 10^{-0.5})$$\nFirst, calculate the product of the area and the intrinsic rate constant:\n$$A k^{0} = 2.0 \\times 1.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}}$$\nNow, calculate the thermodynamic term $(1 - \\Omega)$:\n$$1 - \\Omega = 1 - 10^{-0.5} \\approx 1 - 0.316227766... = 0.683772234...$$\nFinally, compute the total rate:\n$$R_{total} = (3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (0.683772234...)$$\n$$R_{total} \\approx 2.051316702 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R_{total} = 2.051 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}}$$\nThis positive value confirms that the net process is dissolution, as expected for an undersaturated solution.",

Use these to derive a dimensionless sensitivity that quantifies how the measured rate responds to changes in stirring rate at fixed chemistry. Then construct a normalized masking index that maps purely reaction-controlled behavior to $0$ and purely mass-transfer-controlled behavior to $1$, and build a decision rule to flag whether transport masking is present.\n\nAssumptions for the hydrodynamic scaling are that the external mass transfer coefficient obeys a power law $k_m \\propto \\omega^\\beta$ for the given reactor geometry, where $\\omega$ is the stirring rate and $\\beta$ is a known exponent.

            "solution": "The problem requires the formulation and implementation of a criterion to detect transport masking in mineral dissolution experiments. This criterion is to be based on the relationship between the measured dissolution rate, $r$, and the stirring rate, $\\omega$, at a constant solution composition. The derivation begins from fundamental principles of reaction kinetics and mass transfer.\n\nAt steady state, the overall measured rate of dissolution, $r$, is governed by two processes in series: the intrinsic chemical reaction at the mineral surface and the mass transfer of dissolved species through a hydrodynamic boundary layer into the bulk solution. This can be conceptualized using an analogy to electrical resistances, where the total resistance to the process is the sum of the individual resistances. The rate, analogous to current, is inversely proportional to the total resistance.\n\nLet $r_{int}$ be the intrinsic rate of reaction, which would be observed if mass transfer were infinitely fast. Let $r_{tr}$ be the maximum rate of mass transfer, which would be observed if the surface reaction were infinitely fast. The overall observed rate, $r$, can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{1}{r_{int}} + \\frac{1}{r_{tr}}\n$$\nThis equation states that the total \"slowness\" ($1/r$) is the sum of the slowness of the reaction ($1/r_{int}$) and the slowness of transport ($1/r_{tr}$).\n\nThe intrinsic rate $r_{int}$ depends only on the chemical conditions at the surface, which are assumed constant for a fixed bulk solution composition in the purely reaction-controlled limit. Therefore, $r_{int}$ is treated as a constant in this analysis.\n\nThe transport rate $r_{tr}$ is determined by the hydrodynamics of the system. According to film theory, this rate is proportional to the external mass transfer coefficient, $k_m$.\n$$\nr_{tr} \\propto k_m\n$$\nThe problem states that for the given reactor geometry, $k_m$ follows a power-law relationship with the stirring rate, $\\omega$:\n$$\nk_m \\propto \\omega^\\beta\n$$\nwhere $\\beta$ is a known hydrodynamic exponent. Consequently, the transport-limited rate also follows this power law:\n$$\nr_{tr} = A \\omega^\\beta\n$$\nfor some constant $A$ that depends on geometry, temperature, and species diffusivity.\n\nSubstituting this into the rate equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{1}{r_{int}} + \\frac{1}{A \\omega^\\beta}\n$$\nThis equation links the observable rate $r$ to the experimental control variable $\\omega$. To quantify the influence of stirring, we derive the dimensionless sensitivity, $S$, defined as the logarithmic derivative of the rate with respect to the stirring rate:\n$$\nS = \\frac{d \\ln r}{d \\ln \\omega}\n$$\nTo find $S$, we can differentiate the rate equation with respect to $\\ln \\omega$. Taking the natural logarithm of the variables gives a linear relationship between $\\ln r$ and $\\ln \\omega$ only in the purely transport-controlled limit. A more general approach is to use implicit differentiation on the reciprocal form. Differentiating with respect to $\\omega$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{dr}{d\\omega} = -\\frac{\\beta}{A \\omega^{\\beta+1}}\n$$\nSolving for $\\frac{dr}{d\\omega}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{d\\omega} = \\frac{r^2 \\beta}{A \\omega^{\\beta+1}}\n$$\nNow, we construct the sensitivity $S$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{d \\ln r}{d \\ln \\omega} = \\frac{\\omega}{r} \\frac{dr}{d\\omega} = \\frac{\\omega}{r} \\left( \\frac{r^2 \\beta}{A \\omega^{\\beta+1}} \\right) = \\frac{r \\beta}{A \\omega^\\beta}\n$$\nRecognizing that $r_{tr} = A \\omega^\\beta$, we obtain the elegant result:\n$$\nS = \\beta \\frac{r}{r_{tr}}\n$$\nThis shows that the sensitivity is the product of the hydrodynamic exponent $\\beta$ and the ratio of the observed rate to the transport-limited rate.\n\nWe can now examine the limiting cases:\n1.  **Pure Reaction Control:** Transport is very fast compared to reaction ($r_{tr} \\gg r_{int}$). The observed rate $r \\approx r_{int}$. The sensitivity $S \\approx \\beta \\frac{r_{int}}{r_{tr}} \\to 0$ as $r_{tr} \\to \\infty$.\n2.  **Pure Transport Control:** Reaction is very fast compared to transport ($r_{int} \\gg r_{tr}$). The observed rate $r \\approx r_{tr}$. The sensitivity $S \\approx \\beta \\frac{r_{tr}}{r_{tr}} = \\beta$.\n\nThe sensitivity $S$ thus ranges from $0$ to $\\beta$. To create a normalized masking index, $\\mathcal{M}$, that maps this range to $[0, 1]$, we divide $S$ by its theoretical maximum, $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{M} = \\frac{S}{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\frac{d \\ln r}{d \\ln \\omega}\n$$\nFrom the derived expression for $S$, this gives $\\mathcal{M} = r/r_{tr}$. This index represents the fraction of the maximum possible transport rate that is actually realized, providing a direct measure of transport limitation. An index $\\mathcal{M} = 0$ indicates no transport limitation (pure kinetic control), while $\\mathcal{M} = 1$ indicates complete transport control.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure is as follows:\n- For a given set of experimental data pairs $(\\omega_i, r_i)$, first transform the data to logarithmic scale: $x_i = \\ln \\omega_i$ and $y_i = \\ln r_i$.\n- Although the relationship between $\\ln r$ and $\\ln \\omega$ is not strictly linear over the entire range, the local slope $d \\ln r / d \\ln \\omega$ is the sensitivity $S$. For a set of experimental points, we can approximate $S$ by the slope of a best-fit line to the $(\\ln \\omega, \\ln r)$ data. This is achieved via a linear least-squares regression.\n- The slope of the regression line for $y$ versus $x$ yields the estimated sensitivity, $\\hat{S}$.\n- The masking index $\\mathcal{M}$ is then calculated as $\\mathcal{M} = \\hat{S} / \\beta$.\n- Due to experimental noise, the estimated $\\mathcal{M}$ might fall slightly outside the physical bounds of $[0, 1]$. It must be clipped to this interval.\n- Finally, the experiment is classified as exhibiting transport masking if the calculated index $\\mathcal{M}$ is greater than or equal to a predefined threshold, $\\delta$.\n\nFor each test experiment, we apply this algorithm using the provided constants $\\beta = 0.70$ and $\\delta = 0.20$.",

Calculate the probability that the observed difference between $k_1$ and $k_2$ is due to measurement uncertainty.\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of the intrinsic rate constant $k$ for each experiment using the provided relation with $n=1$:\n$$k = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{A_{\\mathrm{react}} (1 - \\Omega)}$$\nFor Experiment 1:\n$$k_1 = \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{mol s}^{-1}}{0.0200 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times (1 - 0.30)} = \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^{-8}}{0.0200 \\times 0.70} \\, \\text{mol m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1} = \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^{-8}}{0.014} \\, \\text{mol m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1} \\approx 8.5714 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{mol m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nFor Experiment 2:\n$$k_2 = \\frac{2.70 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{mol s}^{-1}}{0.0500 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times (1 - 0.30)} = \\frac{2.70 \\times 10^{-8}}{0.0500 \\times 0.70} \\, \\text{mol m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1} = \\frac{2.70 \\times 10^{-8}}{0.035} \\, \\text{mol m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1} \\approx 7.7143 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{mol m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we derive the formula for the propagation of uncertainty. For a function $k(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N)$ of independent variables $x_i$, the variance $\\sigma_k^2$ is given by the first-order Taylor series expansion:\n$$\\sigma_k^2 \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial x_i}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{x_i}^2$$\nIn our case, $k$ is a function of $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, $A_{\\mathrm{react}}$, and $\\Omega$. Let's denote these variables as $R$, $A$, and $\\Omega$ for brevity.\n$$k(R, A, \\Omega) = \\frac{R}{A(1 - \\Omega)}$$\nThe variance $\\sigma_k^2$ is therefore:\n$$\\sigma_k^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial R}\\right)^2 \\sigma_R^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial A}\\right)^2 \\sigma_A^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial \\Omega}\\right)^2 \\sigma_\\Omega^2$$\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial R} = \\frac{1}{A(1 - \\Omega)}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial A} = -\\frac{R}{A^2(1 - \\Omega)}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial \\Omega} = \\frac{R}{A(1 - \\Omega)^2}$$\nSubstituting these into the variance equation gives the fundamental expression for the uncertainty:\n$$\\sigma_k^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{A(1 - \\Omega)}\\right)^2 \\sigma_R^2 + \\left(-\\frac{R}{A^2(1 - \\Omega)}\\right)^2 \\sigma_A^2 + \\left(\\frac{R}{A(1 - \\Omega)^2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_\\Omega^2$$\nFor calculation, it is more convenient to work with relative uncertainties. We divide the equation by $k^2 = (R / [A(1 - \\Omega)])^2$:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_k^2}{k^2} \\approx \\frac{[A(1 - \\Omega)]^2}{R^2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{A(1 - \\Omega)}\\right)^2 \\sigma_R^2 + \\frac{R^2}{A^4(1 - \\Omega)^2} \\sigma_A^2 + \\frac{R^2}{A^2(1 - \\Omega)^4} \\sigma_\\Omega^2 \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_k^2}{k^2} \\approx \\frac{\\sigma_R^2}{R^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_A^2}{A^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_\\Omega^2}{(1 - \\Omega)^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_R}{R}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_A}{A}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_\\Omega}{1 - \\Omega}\\right)^2$$\nNow we can calculate the uncertainty for each experiment. The relative uncertainties for $R$ and $A$ and the absolute uncertainty for $\\Omega$ are the same for both experiments, as is the value of $\\Omega$.\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_k}{k}\\right)^2 \\approx (0.02)^2 + (0.15)^2 + \\left(\\frac{0.02}{1 - 0.30}\\right)^2 = 0.0004 + 0.0225 + \\left(\\frac{0.02}{0.70}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_k}{k}\\right)^2 \\approx 0.0004 + 0.0225 + (0.02857...)^2 \\approx 0.0229 + 0.000816... = 0.023716...$$\nThe relative uncertainty in $k$ is the square root:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_k}{k} \\approx \\sqrt{0.023716...} \\approx 0.1540 $$\nThe absolute standard uncertainties are:\n$$ \\sigma_{k1} = k_1 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_k}{k}\\right) \\approx (8.5714 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times 0.1540 \\approx 1.3200 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{mol m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{k2} = k_2 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_k}{k}\\right) \\approx (7.7143 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times 0.1540 \\approx 1.1879 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{mol m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n\nThe question asks whether the difference between $k_1$ and $k_2$ can be explained by measurement uncertainty. The observed difference is:\n$$ \\Delta k = k_1 - k_2 \\approx (8.5714 - 7.7143) \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{mol m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1} = 0.8571 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{mol m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nWe test the null hypothesis $H_0$ that the true values of $k$ are identical, and the observed difference is due to random error. Under $H_0$, the difference $\\Delta k$ is a Gaussian random variable with a mean of $0$ and a variance $\\sigma_{\\Delta k}^2$. Since the measurements for the two experiments are independent, the variance of the difference is the sum of the individual variances:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\Delta k}^2 = \\sigma_{k1}^2 + \\sigma_{k2}^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{k1}^2 = k_1^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_k}{k}\\right)^2 \\approx (8.5714 \\times 10^{-7})^2 \\times 0.023716 \\approx 1.7424 \\times 10^{-14} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{k2}^2 = k_2^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_k}{k}\\right)^2 \\approx (7.7143 \\times 10^{-7})^2 \\times 0.023716 \\approx 1.4113 \\times 10^{-14} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\Delta k}^2 \\approx (1.7424 + 1.4113) \\times 10^{-14} = 3.1537 \\times 10^{-14} $$\nThe standard deviation of the difference is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\Delta k} = \\sqrt{3.1537 \\times 10^{-14}} \\approx 1.7759 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{mol m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nWe compute the z-score, which measures how many standard deviations the observed difference is from the expected difference of $0$ under $H_0$:\n$$ z = \\frac{|\\Delta k - 0|}{\\sigma_{\\Delta k}} = \\frac{0.8571 \\times 10^{-7}}{1.7759 \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 0.4826 $$\nThe two-sided probability of observing a difference at least this extreme is $P(|Z| \\ge |z|)$, where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable. This probability is given by $2 \\times (1 - \\Phi(|z|))$, where $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\n$$ P \\approx 2 \\times (1 - \\Phi(0.4826)) $$\nUsing standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, $\\Phi(0.4826) \\approx 0.6853$.\n$$ P \\approx 2 \\times (1 - 0.6853) = 2 \\times 0.3147 = 0.6294 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the probability is $0.629$.\n\nThis high probability (approximately $63\\%$) indicates that there is a substantial chance of observing a difference of this magnitude or larger purely due to measurement uncertainty. Most of the uncertainty stems from the measurement of the reactive surface area $A_{\\mathrm{react}}$ (the $(\\sigma_A/A)^2$ term, $0.0225$, dominates the sum of squared relative errors, $0.0237$). Therefore, there is no statistically significant evidence to conclude that the intrinsic rate constants are different. The apparent difference is plausibly an artifact of measurement error, primarily from the surface area determination.",
