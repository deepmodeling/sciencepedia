This is a standard problem in the calculus of variations. The function $\\alpha(t)$ that minimizes this integral must satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation.\n\nThe integrand, which we identify as the Lagrangian $L$, is a function of $t$ and $\\alpha' \\equiv \\frac{d\\alpha}{dt}$:\n$$\nL(t, \\alpha, \\alpha') = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right) (\\alpha')^2\n$$\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation is given by\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\alpha} - \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\alpha'}\\right) = 0\n$$\nTo apply this equation, we require that the solution $\\alpha(t)$ be at least twice continuously differentiable, i.e., $\\alpha(t) \\in C^2[0, T]$.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of $L$:\nThe partial derivative with respect to $\\alpha$ is\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\alpha} = 0\n$$\nsince $L$ does not explicitly depend on $\\alpha(t)$.\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to $\\alpha'$ is\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\alpha'} = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right) \\cdot (2\\alpha') = 2K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right) \\frac{d\\alpha}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives:\n$$\n0 - \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(2K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right) \\frac{d\\alpha}{dt}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $2K$ is a non-zero constant, we can divide it out, yielding a simpler differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right) \\frac{d\\alpha}{dt}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis equation implies that the quantity inside the derivative must be a constant. Integrating with respect to $t$, we get:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right) \\frac{d\\alpha}{dt} = C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first constant of integration.\n\nTo find $\\alpha(t)$, we first solve for $\\frac{d\\alpha}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\alpha}{dt} = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we integrate this equation with respect to $t$ to find $\\alpha(t)$:\n$$\n\\alpha(t) = \\int C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right) dt = C_1 \\left(\\frac{\\tau_b}{2}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right) + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second constant of integration.\n\nNext, we apply the given boundary conditions to determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nThe first condition is $\\alpha(0) = 0$:\n$$\n\\alpha(0) = C_1 \\left(\\frac{\\tau_b}{2}\\right) \\exp(0) + C_2 = C_1 \\frac{\\tau_b}{2} + C_2 = 0\n$$\nThis gives $C_2 = -C_1 \\frac{\\tau_b}{2}$. We can substitute this back into the solution for $\\alpha(t)$:\n$$\n\\alpha(t) = C_1 \\frac{\\tau_b}{2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right) - C_1 \\frac{\\tau_b}{2} = C_1 \\frac{\\tau_b}{2} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nThe second condition is $\\alpha(T) = \\alpha_f$:\n$$\n\\alpha(T) = C_1 \\frac{\\tau_b}{2} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{2T}{\\tau_b}\\right) - 1 \\right) = \\alpha_f\n$$\nFrom this, we can solve for the constant quantity $C_1 \\frac{\\tau_b}{2}$:\n$$\nC_1 \\frac{\\tau_b}{2} = \\frac{\\alpha_f}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{2T}{\\tau_b}\\right) - 1}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression back into the equation for $\\alpha(t)$ to obtain the optimal ramp function:\n$$\n\\alpha(t) = \\frac{\\alpha_f}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{2T}{\\tau_b}\\right) - 1} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\alpha(t) = \\alpha_f \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right) - 1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{2T}{\\tau_b}\\right) - 1}\n$$\nTo confirm that this solution corresponds to a minimum, we can check the Legendre necessary condition, which for this problem states that $\\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial (\\alpha')^2} \\ge 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial (\\alpha')^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha'} \\left( 2K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right) \\alpha' \\right) = 2K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2t}{\\tau_b}\\right)\n$$\nSince $K > 0$ and the exponential function is always positive, $\\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial (\\alpha')^2} > 0$ for all $t \\in [0, T]$. This, along with the nature of the problem (a convex functional), ensures that the derived path $\\alpha(t)$ is indeed the unique global minimizer for the energy functional $E[\\alpha]$.\nThe final expression provides the analytic form for the optimal ramp of the feedback coefficient $\\alpha(t)$ on the interval $[0, T]$.",
