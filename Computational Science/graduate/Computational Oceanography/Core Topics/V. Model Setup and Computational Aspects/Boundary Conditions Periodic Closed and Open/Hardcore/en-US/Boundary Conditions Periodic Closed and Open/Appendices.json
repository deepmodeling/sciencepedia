            "solution": "The problem requires a systematic derivation of normal modes for one-dimensional shallow water waves under two distinct sets of boundary conditions, and a final comparison of their fundamental frequencies. The analysis will begin from the provided governing equations.\n\nThe linearized shallow-water equations for a one-dimensional, frictionless, constant-depth channel are given as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} + H \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + g \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} = 0 \\quad (2)\n$$\nwhere $\\eta(x,t)$ is the free-surface elevation, $u(x,t)$ is the depth-averaged velocity, $H$ is the uniform depth, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration.\n\n**1. Derivation of Normal Modes and Dispersion Relation**\n\nTo derive the normal-mode solutions, we first combine the two first-order partial differential equations (PDEs) into a single second-order PDE. We differentiate equation (1) with respect to $t$ and equation (2) with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta}{\\partial t^2} + H \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t \\partial x} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x \\partial t} + g \\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta}{\\partial x^2} = 0\n$$\nAssuming $\\eta$ and $u$ are sufficiently smooth such that the order of differentiation can be interchanged (Schwarz's theorem), we have $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x \\partial t}$. Substituting the expression for the mixed partial derivative from the second equation into the first gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta}{\\partial t^2} - gH \\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta}{\\partial x^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is the classical wave equation, $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta}{\\partial x^2}$, with a wave phase speed $c = \\sqrt{gH}$.\n\nWe seek normal-mode solutions using the method of separation of variables. Let $\\eta(x,t) = \\hat{\\eta}(x) T(t)$. Substituting this into the wave equation yields:\n$$\n\\hat{\\eta}(x) \\frac{d^2 T}{dt^2} = c^2 T(t) \\frac{d^2 \\hat{\\eta}}{dx^2}\n$$\nDividing by $\\hat{\\eta}(x)T(t)$ and rearranging, we separate the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c^2 T(t)} \\frac{d^2 T}{dt^2} = \\frac{1}{\\hat{\\eta}(x)} \\frac{d^2 \\hat{\\eta}}{dx^2}\n$$\nSince the left side is a function of $t$ only and the right side is a function of $x$ only, both must be equal to a constant. For oscillatory (wave-like) solutions, this constant must be negative. We denote it by $-k^2$, where $k$ is the wavenumber. This gives two ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 T}{dt^2} + (kc)^2 T = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\hat{\\eta}}{dx^2} + k^2 \\hat{\\eta} = 0\n$$\nThe temporal equation has solutions of the form $T(t) \\propto \\exp(\\pm i \\omega t)$, where the angular frequency $\\omega$ is related to the wavenumber $k$ by:\n$$\n\\omega^2 = (kc)^2 \\implies \\omega = \\pm ck = \\pm k\\sqrt{gH}\n$$\nThis is the dispersion relation for shallow-water waves. It shows that the frequency is linearly proportional to the wavenumber, meaning the waves are non-dispersive: all waves travel at the same phase speed $c = \\sqrt{gH}$, regardless of their wavelength.\n\nThe spatial equation has general solutions of the form $\\hat{\\eta}(x) = A \\cos(kx) + B \\sin(kx)$. The specific values of $k$ and the constants $A$ and $B$ are determined by the boundary conditions.\nThe general solution for $\\eta(x,t)$ is a superposition of modes, which can be expressed as traveling waves $\\exp(i(kx \\pm \\omega t))$ or as standing waves which are superpositions of these traveling waves. The boundary conditions dictate which form is physically realized.\n\n**2. Closed Basin (Seiche Modes)**\n\nFor a closed basin of length $L$, the boundary conditions are no-normal-flow at the rigid walls, $u(0,t)=0$ and $u(L,t)=0$. To apply these conditions, we must find the velocity field $u(x,t)$ corresponding to our solution for $\\eta(x,t)$. Assuming a harmonic time dependence $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$ for both fields, equations (1) and (2) become:\n$$\n-i\\omega \\hat{\\eta} + H \\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dx} = 0\n$$\n$$\n-i\\omega \\hat{u} + g \\frac{d\\hat{\\eta}}{dx} = 0 \\implies \\hat{u} = \\frac{g}{i\\omega} \\frac{d\\hat{\\eta}}{dx}\n$$\nWith $\\hat{\\eta}(x) = A \\cos(kx) + B \\sin(kx)$, we have $\\frac{d\\hat{\\eta}}{dx} = -Ak \\sin(kx) + Bk \\cos(kx)$.\nThus, the spatial structure of the velocity is:\n$$\n\\hat{u}(x) = \\frac{gk}{i\\omega} (-A \\sin(kx) + B \\cos(kx))\n$$\nApplying the boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$\n\\hat{u}(0) = \\frac{gk}{i\\omega} (B) = 0 \\implies B=0\n$$\nThis implies that the spatial structure for elevation must be purely cosine-like, $\\hat{\\eta}(x) = A \\cos(kx)$, and the velocity structure must be sine-like, $\\hat{u}(x) = - A \\frac{gk}{i\\omega} \\sin(kx)$.\n\nNow, applying the boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$\n\\hat{u}(L) = - A \\frac{gk}{i\\omega} \\sin(kL) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(kL) = 0$. This condition quantizes the allowed wavenumbers:\n$$\nkL = n\\pi, \\quad \\text{for } n=1, 2, 3, \\dots\n$$\nThe allowed wavenumbers are $k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$. The case $n=0$ implies $k=0$, which gives $\\hat{u}(x) \\equiv 0$ and $\\hat{\\eta}(x) = \\text{constant}$. This corresponds to a uniform raising or lowering of the water level with zero velocity and zero frequency, which is not a dynamic mode. The lowest-frequency dynamic mode is for $n=1$.\n\nThe full solutions for the normal modes (seiches) are:\n$$\n\\eta_n(x,t) = A_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\cos(\\omega_n t + \\phi_n)\n$$\n$$\nu_n(x,t) = \\frac{g k_n A_n}{\\omega_n} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\sin(\\omega_n t + \\phi_n) = \\frac{c A_n}{H} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\sin(\\omega_n t + \\phi_n)\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_n = c k_n = \\frac{n\\pi\\sqrt{gH}}{L}$.\n\nThe solutions are standing waves. The spatial patterns, $\\cos(k_n x)$ for $\\eta$ and $\\sin(k_n x)$ for $u$, are fixed, and their amplitudes oscillate in time. Note the quadrature phase relationship ($\\pi/2$ shift) between $\\eta$ and $u$ in time. When elevation is maximum (at turning points of the slosh), velocity is zero. When velocity is maximum (at mid-slosh), the surface is flat ($\\eta=0$). This signifies an oscillation between potential energy (proportional to $\\eta^2$) and kinetic energy (proportional to $u^2$). The time-averaged energy flux, which is proportional to $\\langle \\eta u \\rangle$, is zero, as $\\langle \\cos(\\omega t) \\sin(\\omega t) \\rangle = 0$. No net energy is propagated.\n\n**3. Periodic Channel (Traveling Waves)**\n\nFor a periodic channel, the boundary conditions require that the solution be periodic over the length $L$: $u(x+L,t) = u(x,t)$ and $\\eta(x+L,t) = \\eta(x,t)$. It is most natural to use complex exponential forms for the spatial part of the solution, $\\hat{\\eta}(x) = A\\exp(ikx)$ and $\\hat{u}(x) = \\hat{U}\\exp(ikx)$, which represent traveling waves.\nApplying the periodicity condition to $\\hat{\\eta}(x)$:\n$$\nA\\exp(ik(x+L)) = A\\exp(ikx) \\implies \\exp(ikL) = 1\n$$\nThis is satisfied if $kL$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$:\n$$\nkL = 2n\\pi, \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ (any integer)}\n$$\nThe allowed wavenumbers are $k_n = \\frac{2n\\pi}{L}$. Positive integers $n$ correspond to waves traveling in the $+x$ direction, and negative integers correspond to waves traveling in the $-x$ direction. $n=0$ is again the zero-frequency, constant-state mode.\n\nThe solutions are traveling waves of the form:\n$$\n\\eta_n(x,t) = A_n \\exp\\left(i\\left(\\frac{2n\\pi x}{L} - \\omega_n t\\right)\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_n = c |k_n| = \\frac{2|n|\\pi\\sqrt{gH}}{L}$. In contrast to the closed basin, the periodic boundary conditions allow for modes that continuously propagate energy. To see this, we find the corresponding velocity $u$. Taking the real part of the solutions for a wave traveling in the $+x$ direction ($n0$):\n$$\n\\eta(x,t) = A \\cos(kx - \\omega t)\n$$\nFrom $\\partial u/\\partial t = -g \\partial \\eta/\\partial x = -g(-kA\\sin(kx-\\omega t))$, we integrate to get:\n$$\nu(x,t) = \\frac{gk}{\\omega} A \\cos(kx - \\omega t) = \\frac{g}{c} A \\cos(kx-\\omega t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{H}} \\eta(x,t)\n$$\nHere, $u$ and $\\eta$ are in phase. The time-averaged energy flux is proportional to $\\langle \\eta u \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{H}} \\langle \\eta^2 \\rangle$. Since $\\langle \\cos^2(\\cdot) \\rangle = 1/2$, the time-averaged flux is non-zero, indicating a net transport of energy in the direction of wave propagation.\n\n**Computation of the Frequency Ratio R**\n\nWe need to find the ratio $R$ of the fundamental eigenfrequency in the closed basin to that in the periodic channel. The \"fundamental\" frequency is the lowest non-zero frequency.\n\n-   **Closed Basin Fundamental Frequency ($\\omega_{closed, fund}$)**: This corresponds to the mode $n=1$.\n    The wavenumber is $k_{closed, fund} = \\frac{\\pi}{L}$.\n    The frequency is $\\omega_{closed, fund} = c \\cdot k_{closed, fund} = \\sqrt{gH} \\frac{\\pi}{L}$.\n\n-   **Periodic Channel Fundamental Frequency ($\\omega_{periodic, fund}$)**: The fundamental traveling-wave frequency corresponds to the smallest non-zero magnitude of the wavenumber, which is for $n=\\pm 1$.\n    The wavenumber is $|k_{periodic, fund}| = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}$.\n    The frequency is $\\omega_{periodic, fund} = c \\cdot |k_{periodic, fund}| = \\sqrt{gH} \\frac{2\\pi}{L}$.\n\n-   **Ratio $R$**:\n    $$\n    R = \\frac{\\omega_{closed, fund}}{\\omega_{periodic, fund}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{gH} \\frac{\\pi}{L}}{\\sqrt{gH} \\frac{2\\pi}{L}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{L}}{\\frac{2\\pi}{L}}\n    $$\n    $$\n    R = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2}\n    $$\nThe physical interpretation is that the fundamental mode in a closed basin has a wavelength of $\\lambda = 2L$ (half a wavelength fits in the basin), while the fundamental mode in a periodic channel has a wavelength of $\\lambda=L$ (one full wavelength fits into the domain). Since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength for a constant phase speed ($\\omega = c k = c \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$), the frequency for the closed basin mode is half that of the periodic channel mode.",

Using the binomial approximation $(1+z)^{1/2} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2}z$ for small $|z|$, where $z = \\frac{2i\\gamma(x)}{\\omega}$:\n$$\nk(x) = \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\left( 1 + \\frac{2i\\gamma(x)}{\\omega} \\right)^{1/2} \\approx \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2i\\gamma(x)}{\\omega} \\right) = \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\left( 1 + i \\frac{\\gamma(x)}{\\omega} \\right)\n$$\nThus, the complex wavenumber can be expressed as $k(x) = k_r + i k_i(x)$, where the real part is $k_r = \\omega/c$ (the wavenumber in the undamped medium) and the imaginary part is $k_i(x) = \\frac{\\gamma(x)}{c}$.\n\nThe Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) approximation for a solution to $\\hat{\\eta}'' + k^2(x)\\hat{\\eta} = 0$ is given by a superposition of rightward- and leftward-propagating waves. The spatial part of a rightward-propagating wave has the form $\\hat{\\eta}_{+}(x) \\propto \\exp\\left(i \\int^x k(x') dx'\\right)$. The amplitude is modulated by the imaginary part of $k(x)$.\n$$\ni \\int^x k(x') dx' = i \\int^x \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c} + i\\frac{\\gamma(x')}{c}\\right) dx' = i \\frac{\\omega}{c} x - \\int^x \\frac{\\gamma(x')}{c} dx'\n$$\nThe amplitude of the wave is affected by the term $\\exp\\left(-\\int \\frac{\\gamma(x')}{c} dx'\\right)$.\n\nAn incoming wave with amplitude $A_{in}$ at the entrance of the sponge layer ($x=L-d$) propagates to the rigid wall at $x=L$. Its amplitude at the wall is attenuated:\n$$\nA_{wall} = A_{in} \\exp\\left( - \\int_{L-d}^{L} k_i(x) dx \\right) = A_{in} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{1}{c} \\int_{L-d}^{L} \\gamma(x) dx \\right)\n$$\nAt the rigid wall $x=L$, the wave is perfectly reflected. The reflected wave then propagates back from $x=L$ to $x=L-d$, experiencing the same attenuation. The amplitude of the reflected wave as it exits the sponge layer is:\n$$\nA_{out} = A_{wall} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{1}{c} \\int_{L-d}^{L} \\gamma(x) dx \\right) = A_{in} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{2}{c} \\int_{L-d}^{L} \\gamma(x) dx \\right)\n$$\nThe reflection coefficient $R$ is the ratio of the outgoing amplitude to the incoming amplitude at $x=L-d$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{A_{out}}{A_{in}} = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{2}{c} \\int_{L-d}^{L} \\gamma(x) dx \\right)\n$$\nNext, we evaluate the integral using the given quadratic profile for the damping rate $\\gamma(x) = \\sigma_{0}\\left(\\frac{x-(L-d)}{d}\\right)^{2}$ for $x \\in [L-d,L]$. Let $u = x - (L-d)$, so $du = dx$. The limits of integration become $u=0$ at $x=L-d$ and $u=d$ at $x=L$.\n$$\n\\int_{L-d}^{L} \\gamma(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{d} \\sigma_{0} \\left(\\frac{u}{d}\\right)^2 du = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{d^2} \\int_{0}^{d} u^2 du = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{d^2} \\left[ \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_0^d = \\frac{\\sigma_0 d^3}{3d^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_0 d}{3}\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2}{c} \\frac{\\sigma_0 d}{3}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\sigma_0 d}{3c}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem defines the absorption length scale $L_a$ such that $R \\approx \\exp(-2d/L_a)$. Comparing our derived expression for $R$ with this definition, we can identify $L_a$:\n$$\n\\frac{2d}{L_a} = \\frac{2\\sigma_0 d}{3c} \\implies L_a = \\frac{3c}{\\sigma_0}\n$$\nThe final task is to find the minimum sponge thickness $d_{min}$ such that the reflection coefficient $R$ is no more than a specified value $R_{max}$. We set our expression for $R$ equal to $R_{max}$ for the minimum thickness:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\sigma_0 d_{min}}{3c}\\right) = R_{max}\n$$\nSolving for $d_{min}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\frac{2\\sigma_0 d_{min}}{3c} = \\ln(R_{max})\n$$\n$$\nd_{min} = -\\frac{3c}{2\\sigma_0} \\ln(R_{max}) = \\frac{3c}{2\\sigma_0} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{R_{max}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given physical parameters: $c = 50\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$, $\\sigma_0 = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and $R_{max} = 10^{-2}$.\n$$\nd_{min} = -\\frac{3 \\times 50}{2 \\times 0.1} \\ln(10^{-2})\n$$\n$$\nd_{min} = -\\frac{150}{0.2} (\\ln(1) - \\ln(10^2)) = -750 (-2 \\ln(10)) = 1500 \\ln(10)\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.30258509...$, we calculate the numerical value for $d_{min}$:\n$$\nd_{min} \\approx 1500 \\times 2.30258509 = 3453.877635\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as required gives:\n$$\nd_{min} \\approx 3454\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$",
