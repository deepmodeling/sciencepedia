It is a standard, well-posed exercise in the scale analysis of the governing equations for large-scale ocean circulation. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires a scale analysis of the depth-averaged horizontal momentum equations for a large-scale ocean interior flow. The schematic momentum equation in the horizontal plane ($x, y$) for a velocity field $\\mathbf{u}_h = (u,v)$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_h}{\\partial t}}_{\\text{Local Acceleration}} + \\underbrace{(\\mathbf{u}_h \\cdot \\nabla_h) \\mathbf{u}_h}_{\\text{Nonlinear Advection}} + \\underbrace{f \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_h}_{\\text{Coriolis}} = \\underbrace{-\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\nabla_h p}_{\\text{Pressure Gradient}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}{\\rho_0 H}}_{\\text{Wind Stress}}\n$$\nWe will estimate the characteristic magnitude of each term using the provided scales. First, we ensure consistent units for the length scale $L$:\n$L = 1000\\ \\mathrm{km} = 1000 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{m} = 10^6\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe characteristic scales for the partial derivatives are $\\partial/\\partial t \\sim 1/T$, $\\partial/\\partial x \\sim 1/L$, and $\\partial/\\partial y \\sim 1/L$. The velocity scale is $U$.\n\n1.  **Magnitude Estimation of Acceleration Terms:**\n\n    *   **Local Acceleration**: The time scale is $T=L/U$. The magnitude of this term scales as:\n        $$ \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_h}{\\partial t}\\right| \\sim \\frac{U}{T} = \\frac{U}{L/U} = \\frac{U^2}{L} $$\n        Substituting the values:\n        $$ \\frac{(0.05\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-1})^2}{10^6\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{0.0025\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}}{10^6\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-2} $$\n\n    *   **Nonlinear Advection**: Terms like $u \\partial_x u$ scale as $U \\cdot (U/L) = U^2/L$. The magnitude is thus:\n        $$ |(\\mathbf{u}_h \\cdot \\nabla_h) \\mathbf{u}_h| \\sim \\frac{U^2}{L} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-2} $$\n\n    *   **Coriolis Acceleration**: The magnitude of this term scales as:\n        $$ |f \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_h| \\sim fU $$\n        Substituting the values:\n        $$ (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (0.05\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-1}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-2} $$\n\n    *   **Horizontal Pressure Gradient Acceleration**: In the large-scale ocean interior, the primary balance is geostrophic balance, where the Coriolis force is balanced by the pressure gradient force. Therefore, this term must scale with the Coriolis term:\n        $$ \\left|-\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\nabla_h p\\right| \\sim fU \\approx 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-2} $$\n\n    *   **Depth-Averaged Wind Stress Acceleration**: The magnitude of this term is given directly by its scaling form:\n        $$ \\left|\\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}{\\rho_0 H}\\right| \\sim \\frac{\\tau}{\\rho_0 H} $$\n        Substituting the values:\n        $$ \\frac{0.1\\ \\mathrm{N\\,m}^{-2}}{(1025\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m}^{-3}) \\cdot (4000\\ \\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{0.1}{4.1 \\times 10^6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-2} \\approx 2.439 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-2} $$\n\n2.  **Dimensionless Ratios and Interpretation:**\n\n    To understand the relative importance of these terms, we form their dimensionless ratios with respect to the Coriolis acceleration, which is typically the largest term for large-scale geophysical flows.\n\n    *   Ratio of **Inertial Terms** (Local Acceleration and Nonlinear Advection) to Coriolis:\n        $$ \\frac{U^2/L}{fU} = \\frac{U}{fL} = \\text{Ro} $$\n        This ratio is the Rossby number, $Ro$. Its value is:\n        $$ \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-2}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-2}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4} $$\n\n    *   Ratio of **Pressure Gradient** to Coriolis:\n        $$ \\frac{|-(1/\\rho_0)\\nabla_h p|}{|fU|} \\sim \\frac{fU}{fU} = 1 $$\n\n    *   Ratio of **Wind Stress** to Coriolis:\n        $$ \\frac{\\tau/(\\rho_0 H)}{fU} \\approx \\frac{2.439 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-2}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-2}} \\approx 4.88 \\times 10^{-3} $$\n\n    **Interpretation**: The analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of scales. The Coriolis and pressure gradient terms are the largest, with magnitudes of approximately $5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-2}$. The next largest term is the wind stress forcing, which is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller ($\\sim 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-2}$). The inertial terms (local acceleration and advection) are the smallest, nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the Coriolis term ($\\sim 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-2}$).\n\n    The fact that the Rossby number $Ro = U/(fL) \\approx 5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ll 1$ is the fundamental justification for the theory of large-scale wind-driven ocean circulation. It signifies that the flow is in **geostrophic balance** to a very good first approximation:\n    $$ f \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_h \\approx -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\nabla_h p $$\n    The inertial accelerations can be neglected from the leading-order momentum balance. The vorticity balance characteristic of the interior (Sverdrup balance) arises from considering the smaller, ageostrophic terms. The curl of the wind stress is balanced by the meridional advection of planetary vorticity ($\\beta v$, where $\\beta = \\partial f/\\partial y$), which itself depends on the small departure from pure geostrophy. This scale analysis confirms the validity of these simplifying assumptions.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation:**\n\n    The problem asks for the value of the Rossby number $Ro=U/(fL)$, rounded to three significant figures.\n    $$ Ro = \\frac{U}{fL} = \\frac{0.05\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-1}}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (10^6\\ \\mathrm{m})} $$\n    $$ Ro = \\frac{0.05}{1.0 \\times 10^2} = \\frac{0.05}{100} = 0.0005 $$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, we express this in scientific notation:\n    $$ Ro = 5.00 \\times 10^{-4} $$",

We will proceed to the solution.\n\nThe starting point for the interior ocean dynamics is the steady, linearized vorticity equation on a $\\beta$-plane. For an inviscid, barotropic fluid, the balance is between the advection of planetary vorticity and vortex stretching. This is expressed as:\n$$\n\\beta v = f \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z}\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the meridional velocity, $w$ is the vertical velocity, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $\\beta = df/dy$ is the constant meridional gradient of $f$.\n\nWe vertically integrate this equation over the water column, from the ocean floor at $z=-H$ to the sea surface, which we approximate as $z=0$:\n$$\n\\int_{-H}^{0} \\beta v \\, dz = \\int_{-H}^{0} f \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} \\, dz\n$$\nSince $\\beta$ and $f$ are independent of depth in this model, we can write:\n$$\n\\beta \\int_{-H}^{0} v \\, dz = f \\int_{-H}^{0} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} \\, dz\n$$\nThe vertically integrated meridional transport is defined as $V = \\int_{-H}^{0} v \\, dz$. The integral of the vertical velocity gradient is:\n$$\n\\int_{-H}^{0} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} \\, dz = w(0) - w(-H)\n$$\nAt the flat bottom $z=-H$, the vertical velocity must be zero, so $w(-H)=0$. At the surface $z=0$, the vertical velocity $w(0)$ is the velocity induced by the surface wind stress, known as the Ekman pumping velocity, $w_E$. Thus, the integrated vorticity balance becomes:\n$$\n\\beta V = f w_E\n$$\nThe Ekman pumping velocity $w_E$ is related to the curl of the wind stress $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ by:\n$$\nw_E = \\frac{1}{\\rho_0 f} \\left(\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\right)_z\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_0$ is the constant density of the water. Substituting this expression for $w_E$ into the vorticity balance yields:\n$$\n\\beta V = f \\left( \\frac{1}{\\rho_0 f} \\left(\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\right)_z \\right)\n$$\nThe Coriolis parameter $f$ cancels, giving the Sverdrup balance relation, which links the interior meridional transport directly to the wind stress curl:\n$$\n\\beta V = \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\left(\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\right)_z\n$$\nThis is the interior relation requested by the problem.\n\nNow, we solve for the barotropic streamfunction $\\psi(x,y)$ using the given wind stress curl.

This fortuitously satisfies the no-normal-flow condition $U=0$ at both $x=0$ and $x=L$. This is a special consequence of the wind stress curl being independent of $y$.

In the boundary layer, the governing PDE is:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{\\delta^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial X^2} + r \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\beta}{\\delta} \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial X} = \\Gamma(y)\n$$\nLet's analyze the orders of magnitude of the terms. Let $\\Psi$ be the characteristic magnitude of the streamfunction in the layer. The characteristic length scale for the $y$-derivatives is $L_y$.\nThe terms scale as:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Friction (zonal): $r \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} \\sim O\\left(\\frac{r \\Psi}{\\delta^2}\\right)$\n    \\item Friction (meridional): $r \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2} \\sim O\\left(\\frac{r \\Psi}{L_y^2}\\right)$\n    \\item Planetary vorticity advection: $\\beta \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} \\sim O\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\Psi}{\\delta}\\right)$\n    \\item Wind stress curl: $\\Gamma(y) \\sim O(\\Gamma_0)$\n\\end{itemize}\nSince $\\delta \\ll L_y$ by the definition of a thin boundary layer, we have $\\frac{1}{\\delta^2} \\gg \\frac{1}{L_y^2}$. Therefore, the zonal friction term is much larger than the meridional friction term:\n$$\nO\\left(\\frac{r \\Psi}{\\delta^2}\\right) \\gg O\\left(\\frac{r \\Psi}{L_y^2}\\right)\n$$\nThe physics of the boundary layer requires a balance between the planetary vorticity advection (the $\\beta$-term), which is responsible for the Sverdrup interior, and a friction term that was neglected in the interior. The dominant friction term is the zonal one. The forcing term $\\Gamma(y)$ is balanced by the $\\beta$-term in the interior over the large scale $L_x$; in the thin boundary layer, the dynamical terms involving derivatives of $\\psi$ are much larger. Thus, the primary balance in the western boundary layer is between planetary vorticity advection and zonal friction:\n$$\nr \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} + \\beta \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} \\approx 0\n$$\nExpressing this in terms of the scaled magnitudes:\n$$\nO\\left(\\frac{r \\Psi}{\\delta^2}\\right) \\sim O\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\Psi}{\\delta}\\right)\n$$\nWe can solve for the length scale $\\delta$ where these terms are of the same order of magnitude:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{\\delta^2} \\sim \\frac{\\beta}{\\delta}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{r}{\\delta} \\sim \\beta\n$$\nThis gives the leading-order thickness of the western boundary layer as:\n$$\n\\delta \\sim \\frac{r}{\\beta}\n$$\nThis scale is known as the Stommel layer thickness. The assumption $\\delta \\ll L_x$ made at the outset is equivalent to the condition $r/\\beta \\ll L_x$, which is given in the problem statement. The analysis is therefore self-consistent. The problem asks for the leading-order thickness, which is this characteristic scale.\n\n(As a check, we can solve the homogeneous ODE $r \\psi_{xx} + \\beta \\psi_x \\approx 0$ that governs the boundary layer correction. The characteristic equation is $r\\lambda^2 + \\beta\\lambda = 0$, giving roots $\\lambda=0$ and $\\lambda = -\\beta/r$. The decaying solution is proportional to $\\exp(-\\beta x/r)$. The e-folding scale of this exponential decay is $x=r/\\beta$, confirming our result for $\\delta$.)",
