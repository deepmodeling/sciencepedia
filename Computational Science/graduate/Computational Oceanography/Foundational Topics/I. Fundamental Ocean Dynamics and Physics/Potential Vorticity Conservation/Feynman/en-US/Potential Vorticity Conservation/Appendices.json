After a sufficient amount of time, the fluid attains a state of solid-body rotation, moving with the tank as a rigid body.\n\nSubsequently, a flat, circular lid is slowly and coaxially lowered into the tank, compressing the column of fluid directly beneath it. The process is gentle enough that the fluid can be considered to remain in a balanced state. The final, uniform depth of the compressed fluid column is $H_f = \\alpha H_0$, where $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless constant such that $0 < \\alpha < 1$. The fluid outside the compressed region is free to move and adjust its height.\n\nAssuming the dynamics are governed by the shallow water equations on an f-plane, determine the final relative vorticity, $\\zeta_f$, of the fluid in the compressed region beneath the lid.

            "problem": "Consider a large-scale, steady, geostrophic ocean current flowing in a region where the Coriolis parameter $f$ is constant. The ocean is modeled as a single layer of fluid with constant density and has a uniform depth $H$ in the far field. This current, with a uniform upstream speed $U$ and zero upstream relative vorticity, encounters a stationary, submerged, cylindrical seamount of height $h_m$ and radius $L$. The upstream potential vorticity is thus given by $q_0 = f/H$.\n\nUnder certain conditions, the current is not strong enough to surmount the obstacle, leading to the formation of a stagnant body of water trapped over the seamount, a phenomenon known as a Taylor Cap. The onset of this regime occurs when a stagnation point (where both horizontal velocity components are zero) first appears in the flow field over the seamount.\n\nAssuming the dynamics are described by the quasi-geostrophic (QG) approximation, the perturbation to the background streamfunction, $\\psi'$, induced by the seamount's topography, $h_b(x,y)$, is governed by the Poisson equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2\\psi' = -\\frac{f}{H} h_b(x,y) $$\nThe total streamfunction is $\\psi(x,y) = -Uy + \\psi'$, where the background flow is in the positive $x$-direction.

The task is to diagnose the potential vorticity budget in flux form by computing the storage, advection, and source terms from the fields, and then validate conservation numerically on a set of test cases. Begin from a fundamental base appropriate to rotating, stratified flows: the definition of Ertel potential vorticity and its conservation law under adiabatic and inviscid conditions, and construct the diagnostic budget that can be evaluated from gridded fields. Do not assume any shortcut formulas beyond these bases.\n\nThe domain is periodic in both directions, with lengths $L_x$ and $L_y$. The fields are sampled on a uniform grid with $N_x$ points in the $x$-direction and $N_y$ points in the $y$-direction, so the grid spacings are $d_x = L_x/N_x$ and $d_y = L_y/N_y$.

The problem asks us to compute the residual of this equation, $R = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{u} q) - S$, using specified numerical approximations for given analytical fields on a two-dimensional periodic domain.\n\nThe domain is a square of side lengths $L_x$ and $L_y$, discretized by a uniform grid of $N_x \\times N_y$ points. The grid spacings are $d_x = L_x / N_x$ and $d_y = L_y / N_y$.

The computation is performed at time $t_0$, using field data from times $t_0$ and $t_1 = t_0 + d_t$. At each grid point $(i,j)$, the storage term is:\n    $$\n    T_{i,j} = \\frac{q(x_i, y_j, t_1) - q(x_i, y_j, t_0)}{d_t}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Advection Term ($A$)**: The advection term, $A = \\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{u} q)$, is evaluated at time $t_0$.

For example, $F_{N_x, j} = F_{0, j}$ and $F_{-1, j} = F_{N_x-1, j}$.\n    Letting $F_x = u q$ and $F_y = v q$ be the flux components evaluated at time $t_0$, the advection term at grid point $(i,j)$ is:\n    $$\n    A_{i,j} = \\frac{(uq)_{i+1, j} - (uq)_{i-1, j}}{2 d_x} + \\frac{(vq)_{i, j+1} - (vq)_{i, j-1}}{2 d_y}\n    $$\n    All fields on the right-hand side ($u, v, q$) are evaluated at $t=t_0$.\n\n3.  **Source Term ($S$)**: The source term, $S$, is given by an analytical expression for each test case. It is evaluated at each grid point $(i,j)$ at time $t_0$.\n    $$\n    S_{i,j} = S(x_i, y_j, t_0)\n    $$\n\n4.  **Residual ($R$) and Final Metric**: The residual field $R$ is calculated by combining the discretized terms at each grid point $(i,j)$:\n    $$\n    R_{i,j} = T_{i,j} + A_{i,j} - S_{i,j}\n    $$\n    The final required output is the domain-mean absolute magnitude of this residual, which is a single scalar value representing the average numerical imbalance of the conservation law over the entire grid.\n    $$\n    \\langle |R| \\rangle = \\frac{1}{N_x N_y} \\sum_{i=0}^{N_x-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{N_y-1} |R_{i,j}|\n    $$\n    This metric provides a robust measure of how well the numerical scheme conserves the quantity $q$ for the given analytical solution. A small value indicates that the numerical implementation is consistent with the continuous equation it aims to solve, with the non-zero value arising from the truncation errors of the finite difference schemes.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by first defining the grid and case parameters. For each test case, the fields $q$, $u$, and $v$ are constructed at the required time points on the grid. The numerical derivative operators for periodic domains are implemented, and then applied to compute the fields $T$, $A$, and $S$. Finally, the residual field $R$ is computed, and its domain-mean absolute value is calculated and stored. The process is repeated for all three test cases.",
