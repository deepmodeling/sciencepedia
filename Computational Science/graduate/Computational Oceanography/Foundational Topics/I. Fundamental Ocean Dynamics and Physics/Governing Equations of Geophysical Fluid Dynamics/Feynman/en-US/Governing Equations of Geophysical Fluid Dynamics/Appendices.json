            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the signed fraction of the total buoyancy anomaly attributable to salinity, based on a linearized equation of state for seawater. The derivation begins with the fundamental principles provided.\n\nFirst, we consider the first-order Taylor expansion of the in-situ density $\\rho$ as a function of potential temperature $T$ and practical salinity $S$ around a reference state $(T_{0}, S_{0})$ at a constant reference pressure $p_{0}$. The expansion is:\n$$ \\rho(T, S) \\approx \\rho(T_{0}, S_{0}) + \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T}\\right|_{(T_{0}, S_{0})} (T - T_{0}) + \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial S}\\right|_{(T_{0}, S_{0})} (S - S_{0}) $$\nWe define the anomalies from the reference state as $\\rho' \\equiv \\rho - \\rho_{0}$, $T' \\equiv T - T_{0}$, and $S' \\equiv S - S_{0}$, where $\\rho_{0} \\equiv \\rho(T_{0}, S_{0})$. The density anomaly $\\rho'$ can thus be expressed as:\n$$ \\rho' \\approx \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T}\\right|_{0} T' + \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial S}\\right|_{0} S' $$\nwhere the subscript $0$ indicates that the partial derivatives are evaluated at the reference state $(T_{0}, S_{0}, p_{0})$.\n\nNext, we use the definitions for the thermal expansion coefficient, $\\alpha$, and the haline contraction coefficient, $\\beta$:\n$$ \\alpha \\equiv -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T}\\right)_{S,p} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T}\\right) = -\\rho \\alpha $$\n$$ \\beta \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial S}\\right)_{T,p} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial S}\\right) = \\rho \\beta $$\nEvaluating these at the reference state, where $\\rho = \\rho_{0}$, we get:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T}\\right|_{0} = -\\rho_{0} \\alpha $$\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial S}\\right|_{0} = \\rho_{0} \\beta $$\nHere, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the coefficients measured at the reference state. Substituting these into the expression for the density anomaly gives the linearized equation of state:\n$$ \\rho' \\approx (-\\rho_{0} \\alpha) T' + (\\rho_{0} \\beta) S' = \\rho_{0} (-\\alpha T' + \\beta S') $$\n\nNow, we relate the density anomaly to the buoyancy, $b$, which is defined under the Boussinesq approximation as:\n$$ b \\equiv -g \\frac{\\rho - \\rho_{0}}{\\rho_{0}} = -g \\frac{\\rho'}{\\rho_{0}} $$\nwhere $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. Substituting our expression for $\\rho'$:\n$$ b \\approx -g \\frac{\\rho_{0} (-\\alpha T' + \\beta S')}{\\rho_{0}} = -g (-\\alpha T' + \\beta S') $$\n$$ b \\approx g(\\alpha T' - \\beta S') $$\nThis expression represents the total buoyancy anomaly. We can decompose it into the contribution from the temperature anomaly, $b_{T}$, and the contribution from the salinity anomaly, $b_{S}$:\n$$ b_{T} = g \\alpha T' $$\n$$ b_{S} = -g \\beta S' $$\nsuch that the total buoyancy anomaly is $b = b_{T} + b_{S}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the signed fraction of the total buoyancy anomaly attributable to salinity, defined as $f_{S} \\equiv \\frac{b_{S}}{b_{T} + b_{S}}$. Using the expressions for $b_{T}$ and $b_{S}$:\n$$ f_{S} = \\frac{-g \\beta S'}{g \\alpha T' + (-g \\beta S')} = \\frac{-g \\beta S'}{g (\\alpha T' - \\beta S')} $$\nThe gravitational acceleration $g$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ f_{S} = \\frac{-\\beta S'}{\\alpha T' - \\beta S'} $$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the desired quantity. Note that the reference density $\\rho_{0}$ and the gravitational acceleration $g$ are not needed for this calculation.\n\nWe now substitute the provided numerical values into this expression:\n- $\\alpha = 2.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n- $\\beta = 7.6 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{(PSU)}^{-1}$\n- $T' = -0.80\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $S' = +0.15\\ \\mathrm{PSU}$\n\nFirst, we compute the term $\\alpha T'$:\n$$ \\alpha T' = (2.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (-0.80\\ \\mathrm{K}) = -1.76 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nNext, we compute the term $\\beta S'$:\n$$ \\beta S' = (7.6 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{(PSU)}^{-1}) \\times (0.15\\ \\mathrm{PSU}) = 1.14 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nThe numerator of the fraction is $-\\beta S'$:\n$$ -\\beta S' = -1.14 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nThe denominator is $\\alpha T' - \\beta S'$:\n$$ \\alpha T' - \\beta S' = (-1.76 \\times 10^{-4}) - (1.14 \\times 10^{-4}) = (-1.76 - 1.14) \\times 10^{-4} = -2.90 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nFinally, we compute the fraction $f_{S}$:\n$$ f_{S} = \\frac{-1.14 \\times 10^{-4}}{-2.90 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{1.14}{2.90} $$\n$$ f_{S} \\approx 0.393103448... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$ f_{S} \\approx 0.3931 $$\nThe positive sign indicates that the salinity contribution to buoyancy has the same sign as the total buoyancy anomaly. In this case, both the cold temperature anomaly ($T'  0$) and the salty anomaly ($S' > 0$) make the water denser, resulting in a negative (downward) buoyancy anomaly. The salinity anomaly accounts for approximately $39.31\\%$ of this total negative buoyancy.",

            "solution": "We begin with the horizontal momentum equations for an inviscid fluid parcel on a rotating f-plane, derived from Newton's second law in a rotating frame. Let $u$ and $v$ be the velocity components in the eastward ($x$) and northward ($y$) directions, respectively.

Applying these assumptions, the pressure gradient terms on the right-hand side vanish:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\nThe resulting simplified equations, which describe inertial motion, are:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dt} = fv $$\n$$ \\frac{dv}{dt} = -fu $$\nThis is a system of two coupled first-order linear ordinary differential equations. To solve this system, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time $t$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = f \\frac{dv}{dt} $$\nNow, we substitute the second equation, $\\frac{dv}{dt} = -fu$, into the expression for $\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = f(-fu) = -f^2 u $$\nThis can be rewritten as a standard second-order homogeneous differential equation for simple harmonic motion:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + f^2 u = 0 $$\nThe general solution for $u(t)$ is of the form $u(t) = C_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + C_2 \\sin(\\omega t)$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. By comparing with the derived equation, we identify the angular frequency of these inertial oscillations as:\n$$ \\omega_i = |f| = |2 \\Omega \\sin \\phi| $$\nFrequency must be a non-negative quantity, so we take the absolute value of $f$.\n\nThe period of an oscillation, $T$, is related to its angular frequency by $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$. Therefore, the inertial period, $T_i$, is:\n$$ T_i = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_i} = \\frac{2\\pi}{|f|} = \\frac{2\\pi}{|2 \\Omega \\sin \\phi|} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Omega |\\sin \\phi|} $$\nWe are given the Earth's rotation rate $\\Omega = 7.2921159 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We can now evaluate the inertial period for the specified latitudes. The period is first calculated in seconds and then converted to hours by dividing by $3600$.\n\nCase 1: Latitude $\\phi = 0^{\\circ}$ (Equator)\nAt the equator, $\\sin(0^{\\circ}) = 0$.\n$$ T_i(0^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Omega \\sin(0^{\\circ})} = \\frac{\\pi}{0} \\to \\infty $$\nThe Coriolis parameter is zero, so there is no Coriolis force to drive the oscillation. The period is infinite, meaning inertial oscillations do not exist at the equator.\n\nCase 2: Latitude $\\phi = 30^{\\circ}$\nHere, $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 0.5$.\n$$ T_i(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\pi}{(7.2921159 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times \\sin(30^{\\circ})} = \\frac{\\pi}{(7.2921159 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 0.5} \\approx 86164.09\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nConverting to hours:\n$$ T_i(30^{\\circ}) \\approx \\frac{86164.09}{3600}\\ \\mathrm{hr} \\approx 23.93447\\ \\mathrm{hr} $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $23.93$ hours.\n\nCase 3: Latitude $\\phi = 60^{\\circ}$\nHere, $\\sin(60^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n$$ T_i(60^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\pi}{(7.2921159 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times \\sin(60^{\\circ})} = \\frac{\\pi}{(7.2921159 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} \\approx 49744.9\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nConverting to hours:\n$$ T_i(60^{\\circ}) \\approx \\frac{49744.9}{3600}\\ \\mathrm{hr} \\approx 13.8180\\ \\mathrm{hr} $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $13.82$ hours.\n\nFinally, we consider the implications for observational sampling. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states that to reconstruct a signal of highest frequency $f_{max}$ from discrete samples, the sampling frequency $f_s$ must be strictly greater than twice the maximum frequency, i.e., $f_s > 2 f_{max}$. In terms of the sampling period $T_s = 1/f_s$ and the signal period $T_{signal} = 1/f_{max}$, the condition is $T_s  T_{signal}/2$.\n\nFor inertial motions, the signal period is the inertial period $T_i$. Therefore, to resolve these motions without aliasing, the sampling interval $T_s$ must satisfy:\n$$ T_s  \\frac{T_i}{2} $$\nLet's apply this to our results:\nAt $\\phi = 0^{\\circ}$, $T_i$ is infinite. There are no inertial oscillations, so aliasing of such motion is not a concern.\nAt $\\phi = 30^{\\circ}$, $T_i \\approx 23.93$ hr. The required sampling interval must be $T_s  \\frac{23.93}{2} \\approx 11.97$ hr.\nAt $\\phi = 60^{\\circ}$, $T_i \\approx 13.82$ hr. The required sampling interval must be $T_s  \\frac{13.82}{2} = 6.91$ hr.\n\nThis implies that as latitude increases, the inertial period decreases, and a higher sampling frequency (shorter sampling interval) is required to resolve the motion. A standard $12$-hour sampling interval, for example, would be on the verge of aliasing inertial motions at $30^{\\circ}$ latitude and would be completely inadequate at $60^{\\circ}$ latitude, leading to erroneous interpretation of the observed data.",
