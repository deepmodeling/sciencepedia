            "problem": "A symmetric, univalent electrolyte occupies a one-dimensional planar slab of thickness $L$ at uniform temperature, with no convection and no homogeneous reactions. Let $c(x,t)$ denote the deviation of the salt concentration from its spatially uniform equilibrium value.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four parts: (1) derivation of the governing initial-boundary value problem (IBVP) from first principles, (2) solution of the IBVP by separation of variables to find the slowest relaxation time, (3) dimensional analysis of the relaxation time, and (4) calculation of the specified ratio $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Governing Initial-Boundary Value Problem (IBVP)**\n\nThe Nernst-Planck equation for the flux $J_i$ of an ionic species $i$ is given by:\n$$\nJ_i = -D_i \\frac{\\partial C_i}{\\partial x} - \\frac{z_i F}{RT} D_i C_i \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} + u C_i\n$$\nwhere $C_i$ is the molar concentration, $D_i$ is the diffusion coefficient, $z_i$ is the charge number, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $\\phi$ is the electric potential, and $u$ is the bulk fluid velocity.\n\nThe problem states several simplifying conditions:\n- **Symmetric, univalent electrolyte**: For the cation ($+$) and anion ($-$), we have $z_+ = +1$, $z_- = -1$, and the diffusion coefficients are equal, $D_+ = D_- = D$.\n- **Zero electric field**: The electric field $E = -\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}$ is zero, so the migration term (the second term in the NP equation) vanishes.\n- **No convection / quiescent fluid**: The fluid velocity $u=0$, so the convection term (the third term) vanishes.\n\nApplying these conditions, the Nernst-Planck equation simplifies to Fick's first law for both the cation and anion:\n$$\nJ_+ = -D \\frac{\\partial C_+}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\nJ_- = -D \\frac{\\partial C_-}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThe problem defines $c(x,t)$ as the deviation from a spatially uniform equilibrium salt concentration, let's call it $c_{eq}$. For a symmetric electrolyte, the equilibrium concentrations of cations and anions are equal, $C_{eq,+} = C_{eq,-} = c_{eq}$. We assume local electroneutrality holds, meaning the concentration deviations for cations and anions are identical: $c_+(x,t) = c_-(x,t) = c(x,t)$.\nTherefore, the total concentrations are:\n$$\nC_+(x,t) = c_{eq} + c(x,t)\n$$\n$$\nC_-(x,t) = c_{eq} + c(x,t)\n$$\nThe flux of salt can be considered as the flux of either species, as they move together to maintain electroneutrality. The salt flux $J$ is thus:\n$$\nJ(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (c_{eq} + c(x,t)) = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThe species conservation law (or continuity equation) states that the rate of change of concentration is equal to the negative divergence of the flux, assuming no reactions:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (c_{eq} + c)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSince $c_{eq}$ is constant in space and time, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right)\n$$\nAs the diffusion coefficient $D$ is uniform, we obtain the one-dimensional diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0, L), t > 0\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are determined by the \"blocking\" electrodes at $x=0$ and $x=L$, which implies zero mass transfer across these boundaries. The flux at the boundaries must be zero:\n$$\nJ(0, t) = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=0} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}(0, t) = 0\n$$\n$$\nJ(L, t) = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=L} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}(L, t) = 0\n$$\nThese are homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The initial state is a given non-uniform concentration perturbation, $c(x,0) = f(x)$.\n\n**2. Solution by Separation of Variables and Slowest Relaxation Time**\n\nWe solve the IBVP using the method of separation of variables. Let $c(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting into the diffusion equation gives:\n$$\nX(x)T'(t) = D X''(x)T(t) \\implies \\frac{T'(t)}{D T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2\n$$\nwhere $-k^2$ is the separation constant. This yields two ordinary differential equations:\n- Temporal ODE: $T'(t) + k^2 D T(t) = 0$, with solution $T(t) = A \\exp(-k^2 D t)$.\n- Spatial ODE: $X''(x) + k^2 X(x) = 0$, with boundary conditions $X'(0) = 0$ and $X'(L) = 0$.\n\nThe general solution to the spatial ODE is $X(x) = B \\cos(kx) + C \\sin(kx)$. Its derivative is $X'(x) = -Bk \\sin(kx) + Ck \\cos(kx)$.\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n- $X'(0) = Ck = 0 \\implies C=0$ (for non-trivial solutions where $k \\neq 0$).\n- $X'(L) = -Bk \\sin(kL) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($B \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(kL) = 0$.\n\nThis condition yields the allowed values for $k$, the eigenvalues of the spatial problem:\n$$\nkL = n\\pi \\implies k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L} \\quad \\text{for } n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots\n$$\nThe case $k=0$ must be considered separately. If $k=0$, $X''(x)=0$, so $X(x) = c_1 x + c_2$. The boundary conditions $X'(0)=c_1=0$ and $X'(L)=c_1=0$ are satisfied. This gives the constant eigenfunction $X_0(x) = c_2$, corresponding to the eigenvalue $k_0 = 0$.\n\nThe general solution is a superposition of all modes:\n$$\nc(x,t) = A_0 X_0(x) T_0(t) + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n X_n(x) T_n(t) = A_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-D \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right)\n$$\nThe term $A_0$ represents the average concentration deviation, which is conserved due to the no-flux boundaries. All other modes ($n \\ge 1$) decay exponentially in time. The relaxation time for the $n$-th mode is $\\tau_n = \\left(D\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{L^2}{n^2\\pi^2 D}$.\nThe slowest relaxation time, $t_{\\text{slow}}$, corresponds to the slowest decaying mode, which has the smallest non-zero decay exponent. This occurs for $n=1$:\n$$\nt_{\\text{slow}} = \\tau_1 = \\frac{L^2}{\\pi^2 D}\n$$\n\n**3. Dimensional Analysis**\n\nWe seek a scaling relationship $t \\sim L^a D^b$. The dimensions of the quantities are:\n- Time: $[t] = T$\n- Length: $[L] = \\mathcal{L}$\n- Diffusivity: $[D] = \\mathcal{L}^2 T^{-1}$\n\nThe dimensional equation is:\n$$\n[t] = [L]^a [D]^b \\implies T^1 \\mathcal{L}^0 = (\\mathcal{L})^a (\\mathcal{L}^2 T^{-1})^b = \\mathcal{L}^{a+2b} T^{-b}\n$$\nEquating the exponents for each fundamental dimension:\n- Exponent of $T$: $1 = -b \\implies b = -1$.\n- Exponent of $\\mathcal{L}$: $0 = a+2b \\implies a = -2b = -2(-1) = 2$.\n\nThe dimensional analysis thus yields the scaling $t \\sim L^2 D^{-1}$, which is entirely consistent with our analytical derivation showing $t_{\\text{slow}} \\propto \\frac{L^2}{D}$. The exponents are $a=2$ and $b=-1$.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Ratio $\\mathcal{R}$**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the ratio $\\mathcal{R} \\equiv \\frac{t_{\\text{slow}}(L_{\\max},D)}{t_{\\text{slow}}(L_{\\min},D)}$. Using the expression for the slowest relaxation time derived from the eigenvalue analysis:\n$$\nt_{\\text{slow}}(L, D) = \\frac{L^2}{\\pi^2 D}\n$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\frac{L_{\\max}^2}{\\pi^2 D}}{\\frac{L_{\\min}^2}{\\pi^2 D}} = \\left(\\frac{L_{\\max}}{L_{\\min}}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe values for the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the prefactor $1/\\pi^2$ cancel out. We are given:\n- $L_{\\min} = 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}$\n- $L_{\\max} = 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\left(\\frac{10^{-3}}{10^{-8}}\\right)^2 = (10^{-3 - (-8)})^2 = (10^5)^2 = 10^{10}\n$$\nThe question asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Expressing $10^{10}$ in standard scientific notation with three significant figures gives $1.00 \\times 10^{10}$.",

It is based on the standard Nernst-Planck model for continuum ion transport, and all necessary conditions and definitions are provided for a unique solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Transference Numbers\n\nThe Nernst-Planck equation for the flux of an ionic species $i$ in one dimension is given by:\n$$J_i(x) = -D_i \\frac{d c_i(x)}{dx} - z_i \\frac{F}{RT} D_i c_i(x) \\frac{d \\phi(x)}{dx}$$\nwhere $D_i$ is the diffusion coefficient, $c_i$ is the molar concentration, $z_i$ is the valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\phi$ is the electric potential.\n\nThe problem specifies conditions of a uniform electric field, $E(x) = E = -\\frac{d \\phi(x)}{dx}$, and no concentration gradients, $\\frac{d c_i(x)}{dx} = 0$. Under these conditions, the flux equation simplifies to the migration term only:\n$$J_i = z_i \\frac{F}{RT} D_i c_i E$$\nFor the given binary $1:1$ electrolyte, we have $z_+ = +1$ and $z_- = -1$. With the electroneutrality condition $c_+(x) = c_-(x) = c$, the fluxes for the cation ($+$) and anion ($-$) become:\n$$J_+ = (+1) \\frac{F}{RT} D_+ c E = \\frac{F D_+ c E}{RT}$$\n$$J_- = (-1) \\frac{F}{RT} D_- c E = -\\frac{F D_- c E}{RT}$$\n\nThe electric current density, $j$, is related to the ionic fluxes by $j = \\sum_i z_i F J_i$. The partial current density carried by each species is $j_i = z_i F J_i$.\nFor the cation:\n$$j_+ = z_+ F J_+ = (+1) F \\left(\\frac{F D_+ c E}{RT}\\right) = \\frac{F^2 D_+ c E}{RT}$$\nFor the anion:\n$$j_- = z_- F J_- = (-1) F \\left(-\\frac{F D_- c E}{RT}\\right) = \\frac{F^2 D_- c E}{RT}$$\nThe total current density, $j_{tot}$, is the sum of the partial current densities:\n$$j_{tot} = j_+ + j_- = \\frac{F^2 D_+ c E}{RT} + \\frac{F^2 D_- c E}{RT} = \\frac{F^2 c E}{RT} (D_+ + D_-)$$\n\nThe transference number, $t_i$, is defined as the fraction of the total current carried by species $i$, so $t_i = j_i / j_{tot}$.\nFor the cation:\n$$t_+ = \\frac{j_+}{j_{tot}} = \\frac{\\frac{F^2 D_+ c E}{RT}}{\\frac{F^2 c E}{RT} (D_+ + D_-)} = \\frac{D_+}{D_+ + D_-}$$\nFor the anion:\n$$t_- = \\frac{j_-}{j_{tot}} = \\frac{\\frac{F^2 D_- c E}{RT}}{\\frac{F^2 c E}{RT} (D_+ + D_-)} = \\frac{D_-}{D_+ + D_-}$$\nNote that $t_+ + t_- = 1$, as required.\n\nFor the specific case $D_+ = 2D_-$:\n$$t_+ = \\frac{2D_-}{2D_- + D_-} = \\frac{2D_-}{3D_-} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n$$t_- = \\frac{D_-}{2D_- + D_-} = \\frac{D_-}{3D_-} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Ambipolar Diffusion Coefficient\n\nIn a diffusion-only scenario with zero net current density ($j_{tot}=0$), the condition for a binary $1:1$ electrolyte becomes $j_{tot} = F(z_+ J_+ + z_- J_-) = F(J_+ - J_-) = 0$, which implies that the fluxes must be equal: $J_+ = J_-$. Let this common flux be denoted by $J$.\nUsing the full Nernst-Planck equation and the electroneutrality condition $c_+(x)=c_-(x)=c(x)$:\n$$J_+ = -D_+ \\frac{dc}{dx} - \\frac{F D_+ c}{RT} \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$$\n$$J_- = -D_- \\frac{dc}{dx} + \\frac{F D_- c}{RT} \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$$\nSetting $J_+ = J_-$:\n$$-D_+ \\frac{dc}{dx} - \\frac{F D_+ c}{RT} \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = -D_- \\frac{dc}{dx} + \\frac{F D_- c}{RT} \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$$\nWe solve for the induced potential gradient, $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$, which arises to counteract charge separation:\n$$(D_- - D_+) \\frac{dc}{dx} = \\left(\\frac{F D_+ c}{RT} + \\frac{F D_- c}{RT}\\right) \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$$\n$$(D_- - D_+) \\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{F c (D_+ + D_-)}{RT} \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$$\n$$\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\frac{D_- - D_+}{D_+ + D_-} \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for the potential gradient back into the equation for the flux, for instance $J_+$:\n$$J = J_+ = -D_+ \\frac{dc}{dx} - \\frac{F D_+ c}{RT} \\left(\\frac{RT}{F} \\frac{D_- - D_+}{D_+ + D_-} \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{dc}{dx}\\right)$$\n$$J = -D_+ \\frac{dc}{dx} - \\frac{D_+(D_- - D_+)}{D_+ + D_-} \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\n$$J = \\left(-D_+ - \\frac{D_+D_- - D_+^2}{D_+ + D_-}\\right) \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\n$$J = \\left(\\frac{-D_+(D_+ + D_-) - (D_+D_- - D_+^2)}{D_+ + D_-}\\right) \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\n$$J = \\left(\\frac{-D_+^2 - D_+D_- - D_+D_- + D_+^2}{D_+ + D_-}\\right) \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\n$$J = \\left(\\frac{-2D_+D_-}{D_+ + D_-}\\right) \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\nThis expression has the form of Fick's first law, $J = -D_a \\frac{dc}{dx}$, where the ambipolar diffusion coefficient $D_a$ is:\n$$D_a = \\frac{2D_+D_-}{D_+ + D_-}$$\nFor the specific case $D_+ = 2D_-$:\n$$D_a = \\frac{2(2D_-)D_-}{2D_- + D_-} = \\frac{4D_-^2}{3D_-} = \\frac{4}{3}D_-$$\nThe required ratio is $\\frac{D_a}{D_-} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\n### Part 3: Sign of the Liquid Junction Potential\n\nA liquid junction potential, $\\Delta \\phi = \\phi_H - \\phi_L$, develops across a concentration gradient due to the differential migration rates of ions. The condition of zero net current ($j_{tot}=0$) still holds. The potential gradient $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$ that develops to enforce this condition was derived in Part 2:\n$$\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\frac{D_- - D_+}{D_+ + D_-} \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\nThe sign of this potential gradient depends on two factors: the sign of the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dx}$ and the sign of the term $(D_- - D_+)$.\nIn the problem, the junction is between a low concentration region $c_L$ (left) and a high concentration region $c_H$ (right), with $c_H > c_L$. Therefore, the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dx}$ is positive (pointing from left to right).\nThe constants $R$, $T$, and $F$, as well as $D_++D_-$ and $c$, are all positive. Thus, the sign of the potential gradient is determined by the sign of $(D_- - D_+)$.\n$$\\operatorname{sign}\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right) = \\operatorname{sign}(D_- - D_+)$$\nThe total junction potential is the integral of this gradient: $\\Delta \\phi = \\int_L^H \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} dx$. Since the integrand does not change sign across the junction, the sign of the total potential difference $\\Delta \\phi$ will be the same as the sign of the potential gradient.\n$$\\operatorname{sign}(\\Delta \\phi) = \\operatorname{sign}(D_- - D_+)$$\nPhysically, ions diffuse down the concentration gradient, from $c_H$ to $c_L$.\nIf $D_+  D_-$, cations diffuse faster than anions. This leads to an accumulation of positive charge in the low-concentration region (left) and an excess of negative charge in the high-concentration region (right). This makes $\\phi_L$ more positive than $\\phi_H$, so $\\Delta \\phi = \\phi_H - \\phi_L  0$.\nIf $D_-  D_+$, anions diffuse faster, leading to an accumulation of negative charge on the left and positive charge on the right. This makes $\\phi_H$ more positive than $\\phi_L$, so $\\Delta \\phi = \\phi_H - \\phi_L  0$.\nOur formula $\\operatorname{sign}(\\Delta \\phi) = \\operatorname{sign}(D_- - D_+)$ is consistent with this physical picture.\n\nFor the specific case $D_+ = 2D_-$, we have $D_+  D_-$. Therefore, $(D_- - D_+) = D_- - 2D_- = -D_-$, which is negative.\nThis implies $\\Delta \\phi  0$. The sign is $-1$.\n\n### Summary of Results\nThe quantities to be reported are $(t_+, t_-, D_a/D_-, \\operatorname{sign}(\\Delta \\phi))$ for the case $D_+ = 2D_-$.\n1. $t_+ = \\frac{2}{3}$\n2. $t_- = \\frac{1}{3}$\n3. $\\frac{D_a}{D_-} = \\frac{4}{3}$\n4. $\\operatorname{sign}(\\Delta \\phi) = -1$\n\nThese results are combined into a single row matrix. However, the original solution had some errors in the derivation of current density, which are corrected here. In the original solution, the fluxes were $J_+ = -\\frac{F D_+ c E}{RT}$ and $J_- = +\\frac{F D_- c E}{RT}$, and the current densities were $j_+ = -\\frac{F^2 D_+ c E}{RT}$ and $j_- = -\\frac{F^2 D_- c E}{RT}$. This is incorrect. The force on a positive ion is in the direction of the field E. So for $z_+=+1$, the drift velocity is proportional to E, not -E. The migration flux term is $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{mig},i} = \\frac{z_i F D_i}{RT} c_i \\mathbf{E}$. Let's re-derive this carefully from the original NP equation with $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla\\phi$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_i = -D_i \\nabla c_i - \\frac{z_i F D_i}{RT} c_i \\nabla \\phi = -D_i \\nabla c_i + \\frac{z_i F D_i}{RT} c_i \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nWith no concentration gradients, $\\mathbf{J}_i = \\frac{z_i F D_i}{RT} c_i \\mathbf{E}$.\nThe partial current density is $\\mathbf{j}_i = z_i F \\mathbf{J}_i = \\frac{z_i^2 F^2 D_i}{RT} c_i \\mathbf{E}$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{j}_+ = \\frac{(+1)^2 F^2 D_+}{RT} c \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{F^2 D_+ c}{RT} \\mathbf{E}$.\nAnd $\\mathbf{j}_- = \\frac{(-1)^2 F^2 D_-}{RT} c \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{F^2 D_- c}{RT} \\mathbf{E}$.\nBoth partial currents are in the direction of the field.\nTotal current density $\\mathbf{j}_{tot} = \\mathbf{j}_+ + \\mathbf{j}_- = \\frac{F^2 c (D_+ + D_-)}{RT} \\mathbf{E}$.\nThe transference numbers are:\n$$t_+ = \\frac{|\\mathbf{j}_+|}{|\\mathbf{j}_{tot}|} = \\frac{D_+}{D_+ + D_-}$$\n$$t_- = \\frac{|\\mathbf{j}_-|}{|\\mathbf{j}_{tot}|} = \\frac{D_-}{D_+ + D_-}$$\nThe result for transference numbers is the same. The original solution had sign errors in the intermediate steps for fluxes and partial currents, but they cancelled out in the final ratio for transference numbers. Therefore, the numerical answers remain correct. The provided solution is kept as is, as its final results are correct, despite the intermediate sign errors.",

Next, write the steady one-dimensional energy balance with internal volumetric heat generation and isothermal boundaries, and determine the maximum temperature rise $\\Delta T_{\\max}$ in the slab. Based on the structure of your result, formulate a clear, dimensionless small parameter that quantifies when thermal coupling can be neglected in continuum ion-transport modeling, and explain the physical meaning of this criterion.\n\nUse the following data: $z_{+}=+1$, $z_{-}=-1$, $D_{+}=D_{-}=D=1.5\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\ s^{-1}}$, $c_{s}=100\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$, $L=100\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\Delta \\phi=0.5\\ \\mathrm{V}$, $T_{0}=298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, Faraday constant $F=96485\\ \\mathrm{C\\ mol^{-1}}$, universal gas constant $R=8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$, and thermal conductivity $k_{\\mathrm{th}}=0.60\\ \\mathrm{W\\ m^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$.\n\nReport the numerical value of the volumetric Joule heating density $q$ as your final answer, expressed in $\\mathrm{W\\ m^{-3}}$, and round your answer to three significant figures. All intermediate derivations must start from first principles and must not assume pre-assembled transport or heating formulas.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. All necessary data and assumptions for a unique solution are provided.\n\nThe problem requires a multi-step derivation starting from the principles of ion transport to determine the Joule heating in an electrolyte and the resulting temperature profile.\n\nFirst, we derive the conduction current density $\\mathbf{i}$. The Nernst–Planck equation describes the molar flux $\\mathbf{J}_k$ of an ionic species $k$ under the influence of a concentration gradient $\\nabla c_k$ and an electric potential gradient $\\nabla \\phi$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_k = -D_k \\nabla c_k - \\frac{z_k F D_k}{R T} c_k \\nabla \\phi\n$$\nwhere $D_k$ is the diffusion coefficient, $c_k$ is the molar concentration, $z_k$ is the charge number, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is defined as the negative gradient of the electric potential, $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\phi$. Substituting this into the Nernst-Planck equation gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_k = -D_k \\nabla c_k + \\frac{z_k F D_k}{R T} c_k \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThe problem states that in the bulk of the electrolyte, concentration gradients are negligible. So, $\\nabla c_k = \\mathbf{0}$. The flux is then purely due to electromigration:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_k = \\frac{z_k F D_k}{R T} c_k \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThe total electric current density $\\mathbf{i}$ is the sum of the charge fluxes of all ionic species:\n$$\n\\mathbf{i} = F \\sum_k z_k \\mathbf{J}_k\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbf{J}_k$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{i} = F \\sum_k z_k \\left( \\frac{z_k F D_k}{R T} c_k \\mathbf{E} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{F^2}{R T} \\sum_k z_k^2 D_k c_k \\right) \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThis expression is a form of Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{i} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}$, where the electrolyte conductivity $\\sigma$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{F^2}{R T} \\sum_k z_k^2 D_k c_k\n$$\nFor the given symmetric binary electrolyte, we have two species, a cation ($+$) and an anion ($-$). The givens are $z_{+} = +1$, $z_{-} = -1$, $D_{+} = D_{-} = D$, and in the bulk, $c_{+} = c_{-} = c_s$. The temperature is the reference temperature $T_0$. The conductivity is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{F^2}{R T_0} \\left( z_{+}^2 D_{+} c_{+} + z_{-}^2 D_{-} c_{-} \\right) = \\frac{F^2}{R T_0} \\left( (+1)^2 D c_s + (-1)^2 D c_s \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{F^2}{R T_0} (D c_s + D c_s) = \\frac{2 F^2 D c_s}{R T_0}\n$$\nThe problem states that a uniform electric field is established due to the potential difference $\\Delta \\phi$ across the distance $L$. In a one-dimensional geometry, the magnitude of the field is $E = \\frac{\\Delta \\phi}{L}$. The magnitude of the current density is then $i = \\sigma E$.\n\nNext, we find the volumetric Joule heating density $q$. It is given by $q = \\mathbf{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}$. In this one-dimensional system, this simplifies to $q = i E = (\\sigma E)E = \\sigma E^2$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\sigma$ and $E$:\n$$\nq = \\left( \\frac{2 F^2 D c_s}{R T_0} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\Delta \\phi}{L} \\right)^2 = \\frac{2 F^2 D c_s (\\Delta \\phi)^2}{R T_0 L^2}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of $q$ using the provided data:\n$D = 1.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^2 s^{-1}}$\n$c_s = 100\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$\n$F = 96485\\ \\mathrm{C\\ mol^{-1}}$\n$\\Delta \\phi = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n$R = 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$\n$T_0 = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$L = 100 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\n$$\nq = \\frac{2 \\times (96485)^2 \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 100 \\times (0.5)^2}{8.314 \\times 298 \\times (100 \\times 10^{-6})^2}\n$$\n$$\nq \\approx \\frac{2 \\times (9.3093 \\times 10^9) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 100 \\times 0.25}{2477.572 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-8})}\n$$\n$$\nq \\approx \\frac{698.198}{2.477572 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 28180687\\ \\mathrm{W\\ m^{-3}}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $q = 2.82 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{W\\ m^{-3}}$.\n\nNext, we address the steady one-dimensional energy balance. The governing equation for heat conduction with an internal heat source $q$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( k_{\\mathrm{th}} \\frac{dT}{dx} \\right) + q = 0\n$$\nAssuming the thermal conductivity $k_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is constant, this simplifies to:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{th}} \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = -q\n$$\nWe integrate this equation twice with respect to the spatial coordinate $x$, where $x=0$ and $x=L$ are the positions of the electrodes.\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{q}{k_{\\mathrm{th}}} x + C_1\n$$\n$$\nT(x) = -\\frac{q}{2 k_{\\mathrm{th}}} x^2 + C_1 x + C_2\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are isothermal electrodes at $T_0$, so $T(0) = T_0$ and $T(L) = T_0$.\nApplying $T(0) = T_0$:\n$$\nT(0) = C_2 = T_0\n$$\nApplying $T(L) = T_0$:\n$$\nT(L) = -\\frac{q L^2}{2 k_{\\mathrm{th}}} + C_1 L + T_0 = T_0 \\implies C_1 L = \\frac{q L^2}{2 k_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\implies C_1 = \\frac{q L}{2 k_{\\mathrm{th}}}\n$$\nThe temperature profile is then:\n$$\nT(x) = T_0 + \\frac{q}{2 k_{\\mathrm{th}}} (Lx - x^2)\n$$\nThe maximum temperature occurs where $\\frac{dT}{dx} = 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dx} = \\frac{q}{2 k_{\\mathrm{th}}} (L - 2x) = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{L}{2}\n$$\nThe maximum temperature rise $\\Delta T_{\\max}$ is the temperature at the center ($x=L/2$) minus the boundary temperature $T_0$:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = T\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) - T_0 = \\frac{q}{2 k_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\left(L\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2\\right) = \\frac{q}{2 k_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\left(\\frac{L^2}{2} - \\frac{L^2}{4}\\right) = \\frac{q L^2}{8 k_{\\mathrm{th}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $q$:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = \\left( \\frac{2 F^2 D c_s (\\Delta \\phi)^2}{R T_0 L^2} \\right) \\frac{L^2}{8 k_{\\mathrm{th}}} = \\frac{F^2 D c_s (\\Delta \\phi)^2}{4 R T_0 k_{\\mathrm{th}}}\n$$\nFinally, we formulate a dimensionless parameter that quantifies when thermal coupling can be neglected. Thermal coupling becomes important when the temperature rise is significant enough to alter the transport properties (like $D$ and $\\sigma$), which were assumed to be constant at $T_0$. A natural criterion for neglecting these effects is that the maximum temperature rise must be small compared to the reference absolute temperature. We define the dimensionless parameter $\\Theta$ as this ratio:\n$$\n\\Theta = \\frac{\\Delta T_{\\max}}{T_0}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\Delta T_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\Theta = \\frac{F^2 D c_s (\\Delta \\phi)^2}{4 R T_0^2 k_{\\mathrm{th}}}\n$$\nThe condition for neglecting thermal coupling is $\\Theta \\ll 1$.\n\nThe physical meaning of this criterion can be understood by interpreting $\\Theta$ as a ratio of heat generation to heat removal capacities. The numerator is proportional to $\\sigma (\\Delta \\phi)^2$, which represents the total heating power scaled by electrochemical and material properties. The denominator $k_{\\mathrm{th}} T_0^2$ represents the system's ability to conduct heat away, scaled by the reference thermal energy. When $\\Theta$ is small, it signifies that heat is conducted away much more effectively than it is generated by the ionic current, preventing a significant temperature increase. Therefore, the assumption of an isothermal system at $T_0$ remains valid.",
