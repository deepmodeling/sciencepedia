            "problem": "Consider an outer-sphere, nonadiabatic electron transfer between two species in solution at temperature $T$. The goal is to compute the rate constant $k$ as a function of the standard Gibbs free energy change $\\Delta G^0$ for fixed reorganization energy $\\lambda$ and electronic coupling $H_{AB}$, and to quantitatively illustrate the existence of the inverted region by examining how $k$ varies with increasing exergonicity (more negative $\\Delta G^0$). The derivation and computation must start from a valid physical base appropriate to computational electrochemistry and outer-sphere electron transfer, namely: (i) Fermi's Golden Rule for nonadiabatic transitions and (ii) the classical high-temperature limit of solvent reorganization modeled by harmonic potential energy surfaces.\n\nYour program must implement the following, without using any pre-provided shortcut formulas in this problem statement. Instead, derive the working expression from the stated base in your solution.\n\n- Adopt the nonadiabatic outer-sphere limit and model the nuclear (solvent) reorganization in the classical high-temperature regime, where the Franck-Condon weighted density of states is Gaussian with variance controlled by the reorganization energy $\\lambda$ and temperature $T$.\n- Use a fixed electronic coupling $H_{AB}$ and a fixed reorganization energy $\\lambda$ across all computations. Use values $H_{AB} = 0.01$ $\\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\lambda = 0.70$ $\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- Use three temperatures to probe thermal effects: $T_1 = 298$ $\\mathrm{K}$, $T_2 = 350$ $\\mathrm{K}$, and $T_3 = 200$ $\\mathrm{K}$.\n- For each temperature, compute $k$ for the same series of $\\Delta G^0$ values (expressed in electronvolts and thus requiring conversion to joules inside your program): $\\Delta G^0 \\in \\{+0.35, 0.00, -0.35, -0.70, -1.40, -2.10, -2.80\\}$ $\\mathrm{eV}$. These correspond to $\\{+0.5\\lambda, 0, -0.5\\lambda, -\\lambda, -2\\lambda, -3\\lambda, -4\\lambda\\}$, which collectively sample the normal region, the activationless point, and the inverted region.\n- All physical constants must be explicitly used with standard values: the Boltzmann constant $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$, the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$, and the electronvolt-to-joule conversion factor. Ensure dimensional consistency such that the final $k$ is in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- The program must compute and return the rate constant $k$ in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for each $\\Delta G^0$ in the specified set for each temperature. Express each computed rate constant in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, rounded to six decimal places.\n- Test Suite and Coverage:\n    1. Case A (happy path): $T = 298$ $\\mathrm{K}$, with the given $\\Delta G^0$ series, fixed $\\lambda$ and $H_{AB}$. This probes the typical ambient condition.\n    2. Case B (broader nuclear distribution): $T = 350$ $\\mathrm{K}$, same $\\Delta G^0$ series, fixed $\\lambda$ and $H_{AB}$. This probes the effect of higher thermal energy on the rate profile.\n    3. Case C (sharper nuclear distribution): $T = 200$ $\\mathrm{K}$, same $\\Delta G^0$ series, fixed $\\lambda$ and $H_{AB}$.

            "solution": "The nonadiabatic outer-sphere electron transfer rate constant in the high-temperature classical limit can be derived from Fermi's Golden Rule together with a Gaussian approximation for nuclear reorganization. The derivation begins with the statement of Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR):\n\n$$\nk \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar}\\,|H_{AB}|^2\\,\\rho(E)\\,,\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is the rate constant in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $H_{AB}$ is the electronic coupling matrix element between donor and acceptor diabatic states (with energy units), and $\\rho(E)$ is the Franck-Condon weighted density of states (FCWD) that accounts for nuclear reorganizational contributions at the energy matching the electron transfer free energy change.\n\nFor outer-sphere electron transfer, one models the nuclear environment (solvent plus intramolecular coordinates contributing to reorganization) as harmonic parabolic free energy surfaces. The reorganization energy $\\lambda$ quantifies the energetic penalty to distort the nuclear coordinates from the equilibrium of the initial electronic state to those of the final electronic state without changing the electronic populations. In the classical high-temperature regime, fluctuations are Gaussian, and the FCWD has the form\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{FCWD}(\\Delta G^0) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi \\lambda k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}} \\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\left(\\Delta G^0 + \\lambda\\right)^2}{4 \\lambda k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)\\,,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta G^0$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change of the electron transfer (negative for exergonic processes), $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Substituting the FCWD into FGR yields\n\n$$\nk(\\Delta G^0; \\lambda, H_{AB}, T) \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar}\\,|H_{AB}|^2\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi \\lambda k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}} \\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\left(\\Delta G^0 + \\lambda\\right)^2}{4 \\lambda k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)\\,.\n$$\n\nDimensional analysis confirms that $|H_{AB}|^2$ has units of energy squared, $\\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar}$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\mathrm{J}^{-1}$, and the prefactor $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi \\lambda k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}}$ has units of $\\mathrm{J}^{-1/2}$. Multiplying these factors with the Gaussian (dimensionless) yields an overall unit of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as required.\n\nThe inverted region arises naturally from the activation barrier embedded in the Gaussian exponent. The effective classical activation free energy for electron transfer is\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\left(\\Delta G^0 + \\lambda\\right)^2}{4\\lambda}\\,,\n$$\n\nwhich grows quadratically as $\\Delta G^0$ becomes more negative beyond the activationless point at $\\Delta G^0 = -\\lambda$. As exergonicity increases from slightly exergonic to the activationless point, the barrier decreases and $k$ increases. However, as $\\Delta G^0$ becomes even more negative than $-\\lambda$, the barrier increases again, and the rate $k$ decreases with further exergonicity, which is the hallmark of the inverted region.\n\nAlgorithmic implementation proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Convert all energy quantities provided in electronvolts to joules using the factor $1 \\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}$ $\\mathrm{J}$. That is, if $x_{\\mathrm{eV}}$ is an energy in electronvolts, then $x_{\\mathrm{J}} = x_{\\mathrm{eV}} \\times 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}$.\n2. Use $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}$ $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ and $\\hbar = 1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}$ $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n3. For each temperature $T \\in \\{298, 350, 200\\}$ $\\mathrm{K}$ and for each $\\Delta G^0$ in the series $\\{+0.35, 0.00, -0.35, -0.70, -1.40, -2.10, -2.80\\}$ $\\mathrm{eV}$ (with fixed $\\lambda = 0.70$ $\\mathrm{eV}$ and $H_{AB} = 0.01$ $\\mathrm{eV}$), compute\n   $$\n   k \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar}\\,H_{AB}^2\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi \\lambda k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}} \\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(\\Delta G^0 + \\lambda)^2}{4 \\lambda k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)\\,,\n   $$\n   where all energy quantities are in joules in the numerical evaluation.\n4. Round each $k$ to six decimal places and collect the results for each temperature into a list; finally assemble all three lists into a top-level list ordered by temperatures $\\{298, 350, 200\\}$ $\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nInterpretation of the expected numerical trend:\n\n- At $\\Delta G^0 = -\\lambda$, the exponent achieves its maximum (least negative), yielding the largest $k$ (the activationless point).\n- For $\\Delta G^0$ values more negative than $-\\lambda$ (e.g., $-2\\lambda, -3\\lambda, -4\\lambda$), the exponent becomes more negative again, so $k$ decreases despite increasing exergonicity—this is the inverted region.\n- At higher $T$, the Gaussian broadens via larger $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$, so rates are generally larger and the inverted region is somewhat less sharp. At lower $T$, the Gaussian narrows, accentuating the peak near $\\Delta G^0 = -\\lambda$ and leading to stronger suppression in the inverted region.\n\nThe program implements these steps exactly and prints the three lists of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ values, rounded to six decimal places, with no spaces in the single output line.",
