            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the Debye length within the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann framework and an explanation of its role in Frumkin corrections to reaction kinetics. I will first derive the expression for the Debye length, then compute its value, and finally discuss its physical implications.\n\nThe analysis begins with the one-dimensional Poisson equation, which relates the electrostatic potential $\\psi(x)$ at a distance $x$ from the planar electrode surface to the local space charge density $\\rho(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nHere, $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of the electrolyte solution. The space charge density $\\rho(x)$ arises from the non-uniform distribution of ions in the diffuse layer. For a symmetric $1:1$ electrolyte, the ions have valences $z_+ = +1$ and $z_- = -1$. In a dilute solution, the local concentrations of the cations, $c_+(x)$, and anions, $c_-(x)$, can be described by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\nc_+(x) = c_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_+ F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right) = c_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nc_-(x) = c_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_- F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right) = c_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(+\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $c_{\\infty}$ is the bulk electrolyte concentration, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe space charge density is the net charge per unit volume:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = F(z_+ c_+(x) + z_- c_-(x)) = F(c_+(x) - c_-(x))\n$$\nSubstituting the Boltzmann distributions gives:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = F c_{\\infty} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sinh(u) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\exp(u) - \\exp(-u))$, the charge density can be written compactly as:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = -2 F c_{\\infty} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\rho(x)$ into the Poisson equation yields the full, nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation for a symmetric $1:1$ electrolyte:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\frac{2 F c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the use of a small-potential linearization. This approximation, also known as the Debye-Hückel approximation, is valid when the potential energy of the ions is much smaller than the thermal energy, i.e., $|F\\psi(x)| \\ll RT$. In this limit, the hyperbolic sine function can be approximated by its argument: $\\sinh(u) \\approx u$. Applying this linearization to the PB equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} \\approx \\frac{2 F c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon} \\left(\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2 F^2 c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon RT}\\right) \\psi(x)\n$$\nThis is the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. It is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation of the form $\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\kappa^2 \\psi(x)$, where $\\kappa^2$ is a constant. By comparison, we identify:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{2 F^2 c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon RT}\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is $\\psi(x) = A\\exp(\\kappa x) + B\\exp(-\\kappa x)$. Applying the boundary condition that the potential vanishes far from the electrode, $\\psi(x \\to \\infty) = 0$, requires that $A=0$. Thus, the potential decays exponentially away from the surface: $\\psi(x) = \\psi_d \\exp(-\\kappa x)$, where $\\psi_d$ is the potential at the outer boundary of the compact layer ($x=0$).\n\nThe parameter $\\kappa$ has units of inverse length, and its reciprocal is the characteristic screening length of the electrostatic potential in the electrolyte. This length is defined as the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$:\n$$\n\\lambda_D \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\kappa} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon RT}{2 F^2 c_{\\infty}}}\n$$\nFor a general symmetric electrolyte with valence $z$, the expression is $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon RT}{2 z^2 F^2 c_{\\infty}}}$. For this problem, $z=1$, so the derived formula is correct.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\lambda_D$ using the provided data:\n$T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$\\varepsilon_r = 78.5$\n$\\varepsilon_0 = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}$\n$\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 = 78.5 \\times (8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}) \\approx 6.9505 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}$\n$c_{\\infty} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$\n$R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$F = 96485.33212\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\lambda_D$:\n$$\n\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{(78.5 \\times 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}) \\times (8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\,\\mathrm{K})}{2 \\times (1)^2 \\times (96485.33212\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}})^2 \\times (10\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}})}}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_D \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1.72236 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.86186 \\times 10^{11}}}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx \\sqrt{9.2507 \\times 10^{-18}}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 3.0415 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nConverting to nanometers gives $\\lambda_D \\approx 3.0415\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Rounding to three significant figures, we get $\\lambda_D = 3.04\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for an explanation of how $\\lambda_D$ influences the diffuse-layer potential $\\psi_d$ and the implications for Frumkin corrections. This requires using the nonlinear PB framework. The solution to the full nonlinear PB equation provides a relationship between the surface charge density on the electrode, $\\sigma$, and the potential at the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), $\\psi_d$. This relationship is known as the Grahame equation:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{8 \\varepsilon R T c_{\\infty}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{z F \\psi_d}{2 R T}\\right)\n$$\nWe can express the pre-factor in terms of the Debye length $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon RT}{2 z^2 F^2 c_{\\infty}}}$. The pre-factor can be rewritten as $\\frac{2 \\varepsilon R T}{z F \\lambda_D}$, so the Grahame equation becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{2 \\varepsilon R T}{z F \\lambda_D} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{z F \\psi_d}{2 R T}\\right)\n$$\nFrom this equation, we can analyze the relationship between $\\lambda_D$ and $\\psi_d$ for a fixed surface charge $\\sigma$. If $\\lambda_D$ decreases (which occurs if the bulk concentration $c_{\\infty}$ or the ionic valence $z$ increases), then the term $1/\\lambda_D$ increases. To maintain a constant $\\sigma$, the term $\\sinh\\left(\\frac{z F \\psi_d}{2 R T}\\right)$ must decrease. Since $\\sinh(u)$ is a monotonically increasing function, a decrease in its value implies that its argument, and thus the magnitude of the potential $|\\psi_d|$, must also decrease.\nPhysically, $\\lambda_D$ represents the thickness of the diffuse layer over which the electrode's charge is screened. A smaller $\\lambda_D$ signifies more compact and effective screening of the surface charge by the counter-ions. Consequently, for a given surface charge density $\\sigma$, the potential drop across this thinner diffuse layer (i.e., $\\psi_d$) is smaller in magnitude.\n\nThe Frumkin correction addresses the effect of the electric double layer on the rate of an interfacial electron transfer reaction. The rate of such a reaction depends on the concentration of the reactant species at the plane of electron transfer, which is often approximated as the OHP. The potential at this plane, $\\psi_d$, modifies the local concentration of a reactant ion of charge $z_{ion}$, denoted $c_{rxn}$, relative to its bulk concentration $c_{\\infty}$ according to the Boltzmann factor:\n$$\nc_{rxn} = c_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_{ion} F \\psi_d}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nThe observed reaction rate, and thus the measured current, is proportional to $c_{rxn}$. The Frumkin correction factor is the ratio $c_{rxn}/c_{\\infty}$, which quantifies the deviation of the observed rate from the 'intrinsic' rate that would be measured if $\\psi_d=0$.\nThe implication of the dependence of $\\psi_d$ on $\\lambda_D$ is now clear. A decrease in the Debye length $\\lambda_D$ (e.g., by adding an inert supporting electrolyte to increase the ionic strength) leads to a reduction in the magnitude of $|\\psi_d|$. This, in turn, makes the Frumkin correction factor, $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_{ion} F \\psi_d}{RT}\\right)$, approach a value of $1$. In other words, in solutions with high ionic strength and thus short Debye lengths, the potential in the diffuse layer is low, and the electrostatic modification of the local reactant concentration is minimized. As a result, the observed electrochemical kinetics more closely reflect the intrinsic kinetics of the reaction, free from the complicating effects of the diffuse double layer.",

Therefore the local charge density is\n$$\n\\rho(\\psi) = F \\left( z_+ c_+^0 \\exp( - z_+ \\phi ) + z_- c_-^0 \\exp( - z_- \\phi ) \\right).\n$$\nFor a salt with stoichiometric coefficients $\\nu_+$ and $\\nu_-$ defining the number of ions per formula unit, electroneutrality in the bulk implies $z_+ c_+^0 + z_- c_-^0 = 0$ and the bulk concentrations can be parameterized as\n$$\nc_+^0 = \\nu_+ c_s, \\quad c_-^0 = \\nu_- c_s,\n$$\nwith $c_s$ the concentration of salt formula units in $\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n\nWe now link the surface potential $\\psi_0 = \\psi(x=0)$ to the surface charge density $\\sigma$ by integrating the Poisson equation. Introduce the electric field $E = - \\frac{d \\psi}{d x}$ and note that the planar boundary condition at the electrode yields $\\sigma = \\varepsilon E(0^+) = - \\varepsilon \\left. \\frac{d \\psi}{d x} \\right|_{x=0^+}$, with the sign convention set by the normal pointing into the electrolyte. Multiply both sides of the Poisson equation by $\\frac{d \\psi}{d x}$,\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\psi}{dx^2} \\frac{d \\psi}{dx} = - \\frac{\\rho(\\psi)}{\\varepsilon} \\frac{d \\psi}{dx}.\n$$\nRecognizing the left-hand side as a derivative,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{d \\psi}{dx} \\right)^2 \\right) = - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\rho(\\psi) \\frac{d \\psi}{dx}.\n$$\nIntegrate from the bulk ($x \\to \\infty$, where $\\psi \\to 0$ and $\\frac{d \\psi}{dx} \\to 0$) to the surface ($x=0$, where $\\psi = \\psi_0$ and $\\frac{d \\psi}{dx} = \\left. \\frac{d \\psi}{dx} \\right|_{0}$),\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left. \\frac{d \\psi}{dx} \\right|_0 \\right)^2 = - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\int_{0}^{\\psi_0} \\rho(\\psi') \\, d \\psi'.\n$$\nUsing $\\sigma = - \\varepsilon \\left. \\frac{d \\psi}{dx} \\right|_0$ and squaring to remove sign ambiguity in the field,\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\varepsilon} = - \\int_{0}^{\\psi_0} \\rho(\\psi') \\, d \\psi'.\n$$\nThis is the general energy integral linking $\\sigma$ to $\\psi_0$ for any binary electrolyte under PB assumptions. Substitute the Boltzmann expression for $\\rho(\\psi)$ and change variables to the dimensionless potential $\\phi = \\frac{F \\psi}{R T}$, with $d \\psi = \\frac{R T}{F} d \\phi$,\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\psi_0} \\rho(\\psi') \\, d \\psi' = \\int_{0}^{\\phi_0} F \\left( z_+ c_+^0 e^{- z_+ \\phi} + z_- c_-^0 e^{- z_- \\phi} \\right) \\frac{R T}{F} \\, d \\phi = R T \\sum_{i \\in \\{+,-\\}} z_i c_i^0 \\int_{0}^{\\phi_0} e^{- z_i \\phi} \\, d \\phi.\n$$\nCompute the integrals,\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\phi_0} e^{- z_i \\phi} \\, d \\phi = - \\frac{1}{z_i} \\left( e^{- z_i \\phi_0} - 1 \\right),\n$$\nso the energy integral simplifies to\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\psi_0} \\rho(\\psi') \\, d \\psi' = - R T \\sum_{i \\in \\{+,-\\}} c_i^0 \\left( e^{- z_i \\phi_0} - 1 \\right).\n$$\nTherefore, the surface charge–surface potential relation is\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = - 2 \\varepsilon \\int_{0}^{\\psi_0} \\rho(\\psi') \\, d \\psi' = 2 \\varepsilon R T \\sum_{i \\in \\{+,-\\}} c_i^0 \\left( e^{- z_i \\phi_0} - 1 \\right),\n$$\nwith $\\phi_0 = \\frac{F \\psi_0}{R T}$. This formula is a generalization of the Grahame equation to arbitrary valence asymmetry and is consistently derived from the Poisson equation and Boltzmann statistics; it reduces to the familiar symmetric result for $z_+ = +1$, $z_- = -1$.\n\nTo compute $\\psi_0$ given $\\sigma$, we solve for $\\phi_0$ in the nonlinear equation\n$$\n2 \\varepsilon R T \\sum_{i \\in \\{+,-\\}} c_i^0 \\left( e^{- z_i \\phi_0} - 1 \\right) - \\sigma^2 = 0,\n$$\nwith the constraint that $\\mathrm{sign}(\\phi_0) = \\mathrm{sign}(\\sigma)$ to select the physically consistent branch in symmetric cases. Robust one-dimensional root-finding with bracketing is used to find $\\phi_0$, and the surface potential follows as\n$$\n\\psi_0 = \\frac{R T}{F} \\phi_0.\n$$\nThe Frumkin correction factor for a reactant of charge number $z_r$ is defined by the ratio of interfacial to bulk concentration due to Boltzmann weighting,\n$$\n\\mathcal{F} = \\frac{c_r(0)}{c_r^{\\mathrm{bulk}}} = \\exp( - z_r \\phi_0 ).\n$$\nFor $z_r = +1$, $\\mathcal{F} = \\exp( - \\phi_0 )$. This modifies the kinetic prefactor in a Butler–Volmer-type rate model by scaling the activity of the charged reactant at the reaction plane; therefore, valence asymmetry influences kinetics through its effect on $\\phi_0(\\sigma)$, altering $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nAlgorithmic steps:\n- For each test case, compute $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$, assemble $z_+$, $z_-$, $\\nu_+$, $\\nu_-$, $c_s$, and $T$.\n- Set bulk concentrations $c_+^0 = \\nu_+ c_s$ and $c_-^0 = \\nu_- c_s$.\n- Define $g(\\phi_0) = 2 \\varepsilon R T \\left( c_+^0 \\left( e^{- z_+ \\phi_0} - 1 \\right) + c_-^0 \\left( e^{- z_- \\phi_0} - 1 \\right) \\right) - \\sigma^2$.\n- If $\\sigma = 0$, set $\\phi_0 = 0$ directly; otherwise, bracket the root in the interval $[0, \\phi_{\\max}]$ for $\\sigma > 0$ or $[- \\phi_{\\max}, 0]$ for $\\sigma < 0$, expanding $\\phi_{\\max}$ until $g$ changes sign across the bracket.\n- Solve $g(\\phi_0) = 0$ for $\\phi_0$ using a bracketing root solver.\n- Compute $\\psi_0 = \\frac{R T}{F} \\phi_0$ and $\\mathcal{F} = \\exp( - \\phi_0 )$ for $z_r = +1$.\n- Produce the outputs in the required single-line, comma-separated list.\n\nScientific realism and edge coverage:\n- Case $1$ tests a moderately charged interface at moderate concentration for a $2:1$ electrolyte, yielding a nontrivial $\\psi_0$ and $\\mathcal{F}$.\n- Case $2$ explores low ionic strength, which increases $\\psi_0$ magnitude due to weaker screening, emphasizing valence asymmetry.\n- Case $3$ provides a symmetric $1:1$ baseline at the same $\\sigma$ and $c_s$ to compare the influence of asymmetry.\n- Case $4$ evaluates negative surface charge, probing the opposite polarity for a $2:1$ electrolyte.\n- Case $5$ examines the near-linear regime (small $\\sigma$), validating consistency with the Debye–Hückel limit, where $\\phi_0$ is small and $\\mathcal{F} \\approx 1 - \\phi_0$.\n\nThe outputs are floats: $\\psi_0$ in volts (V) and dimensionless $\\mathcal{F}$.
