The problem states that the cathodic branch dominates, so we can neglect the anodic current. The reaction is a reduction, so we consider the cathodic current, $i_c$. From the Butler–Volmer equation for a cathodic process far from the equilibrium potential (as per assumption iii), we have:\n$$i \\approx i_c = i_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha n F (E - E_{eq})}{RT}\\right)$$\nHere, $i$ is the magnitude of the current density, $i_0$ is the exchange current density, $\\alpha$ is the charge-transfer symmetry factor for the cathodic reaction, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the rate-determining step (RDS), $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the molar gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $E - E_{eq}$ is the overpotential, with $E$ being the applied electrode potential and $E_{eq}$ being the equilibrium potential.\n\nThe problem specifies that the RDS is the single-electron transfer step $\\mathrm{CO_2 + H^+ + e^- \\to {}^{\\ast}COOH}$.

The calculated theoretical value of $118.3\\ \\mathrm{mV\\ per\\ decade}$ is in excellent agreement with the experimental observation.
