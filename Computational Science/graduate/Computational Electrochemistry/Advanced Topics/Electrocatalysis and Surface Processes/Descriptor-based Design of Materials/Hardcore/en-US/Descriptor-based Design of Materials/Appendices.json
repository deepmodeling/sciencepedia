This practice guides you through the derivation of the potential-dependent work function, a key material property, connecting it to the potential of zero charge ($U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}$). By implementing this relationship, you will gain hands-on experience in modeling the fundamental electronic response of an electrode at the atomic scale .",

            "problem": "You are asked to derive, implement, and evaluate a descriptor-based relation between the potential-dependent work function and electron chemical potential alignment across different surface terminations in computational electrochemistry. Begin from first principles and well-tested facts and do not assume or quote a target end-formula. Use the following foundational bases and definitions only: the electron chemical potential is defined as $ \\mu_e = \\partial G / \\partial n_e $ for the Gibbs free energy $ G $ and electron number $ n_e $; an applied electrode potential $ U $ performs electrostatic work $ -e U $ per electron; the work function $ \\phi $ of a surface is the energy required to remove an electron from the Fermi level to the vacuum level, i.e., the energy difference between the vacuum level and the Fermi level; the potential of zero charge (PZC) is the potential at which the net surface charge density is zero; in the Helmholtz approximation the interfacial potential drop varies linearly with surface charge with a constant differential Helmholtz capacitance $ C_{\\mathrm{H}} $; and the absolute potential of the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) is $ U_{\\mathrm{SHE}}^{\\mathrm{abs}} $, a commonly accepted constant.\n\nTask requirements:\n1. From the stated bases, derive an expression for the potential-dependent work function $ \\phi(U) $ of a metallic electrode surface termination in electronvolts for a given electrode potential $ U $ in volts referenced to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode. Ensure the expression is consistent with the definition of the potential of zero charge $ U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $ and the neutral-surface work function $ \\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $ in electronvolts.\n2. Derive a descriptor for electron chemical potential alignment across different surface terminations, defined as the difference $ \\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{align}}(U) = \\mu_e^{\\mathrm{electrode}}(U) - \\mu_e^{\\mathrm{solution}}(U) $ in electronvolts, where $ \\mu_e^{\\mathrm{electrode}}(U) $ is the electron chemical potential inside the electrode at potential $ U $, and $ \\mu_e^{\\mathrm{solution}}(U) $ is the electron chemical potential of an ideal solution redox level at the same potential $ U $. Express the solution-side electron chemical potential using the absolute SHE potential $ U_{\\mathrm{SHE}}^{\\mathrm{abs}} $ in electronvolts along with the applied $ U $ in volts, and identify whether the resulting descriptor depends on $ U $ under the stated approximations.\n\nAfter you have derived the expressions, implement them in a complete, runnable program that, for each test case, computes:\n- The work function $ \\phi(U) $ in electronvolts at three electrode potentials $ U \\in \\{-0.5, 0.0, +0.5\\} $ volts versus the Standard Hydrogen Electrode.\n- The alignment descriptor $ \\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{align}} $ in electronvolts for that surface termination.\n\nPhysical units and reporting:\n- Express all computed energies in electronvolts and all electrode potentials in volts.

For each surface termination, you are given $ \\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $ in electronvolts and $ U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $ in volts. The test suite consists of four distinct terminations:\n- Case $ 1 $: $ \\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} = 5.20 $, $ U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} = 0.15 $.\n- Case $ 2 $: $ \\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} = 4.00 $, $ U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} = -0.20 $.\n- Case $ 3 $: $ \\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} = 5.80 $, $ U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} = 0.60 $.\n- Case $ 4 $ (boundary consistency check): $ \\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} = 4.44 $, $ U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} = 0.00 $.\n\nProgram output specification:\n- For each case, produce a list of four floats in electronvolts: $ [\\phi(-0.5), \\phi(0.0), \\phi(0.5), \\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{align}}] $, each rounded to four decimal places.\n- Aggregate the results for all four cases into a single list of lists on one line.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example: $ [[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4],[b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4],[c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4],[d_1,d_2,d_3,d_4]] $, where each $ a_i $, $ b_i $, $ c_i $, and $ d_i $ are floats in electronvolts.\n\nScientific realism constraints:\n- Assume metallic electrodes with fast electronic screening such that the Fermi level within the metal responds to applied $ U $ as implied by the stated bases.\n- Assume the Helmholtz approximation with constant $ C_{\\mathrm{H}} $ and ignore diffuse-layer contributions; ensure self-consistency in the derivation with $ U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $ and $ \\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $ as surface-specific inputs.",

It relies on standard definitions and models in computational electrochemistry (e.g., the computational hydrogen electrode model framework). The given constants and test data are physically plausible. The task is to derive relationships from these foundational principles, which is a valid scientific reasoning problem.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be derived and implemented.\n\n### Derivation of Expressions\n\n#### 1. Potential-Dependent Work Function $ \\phi(U) $\nThe electron chemical potential, $ \\mu_e $, is equivalent to the Fermi level, $ E_F $, in a metal. The problem states that an applied potential $ U $ performs electrostatic work $ -eU $ per electron. This implies that a change in the electrode potential from a reference value to $ U $ shifts the Fermi level by a corresponding amount.\n\nLet us select the potential of zero charge, $ U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $, as our reference state. At this potential, the electrode surface is electrically neutral, and its work function is given as $ \\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $.\n\nWhen the electrode potential is changed from $ U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $ to an arbitrary potential $ U $, the change in potential is $ \\Delta U = U - U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $. This change in potential shifts the energy of electrons within the metal. The Fermi level at potential $ U $, denoted $ E_F(U) $, is related to the Fermi level at the PZC, $ E_F(U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}) $, by:\n$$ E_F(U) = E_F(U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}) - e(U - U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}) $$\nwhere $ e $ is the elementary charge.\n\nThe work function $ \\phi(U) $ is defined as the energy difference between the vacuum level, $ E_{\\mathrm{vac}} $, and the Fermi level, $ E_F(U) $. In energy units, this is $ e\\phi(U) = E_{\\mathrm{vac}}(U) - E_F(U) $. In this model, we assume the local vacuum level just outside the surface is not affected by the change in potential, i.e., $ E_{\\mathrm{vac}}(U) \\approx E_{\\mathrm{vac}}(U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}) $. This simplification is consistent with using the provided first principles and ignoring explicit capacitive charging effects on the surface dipole.\n\nUnder this assumption, the change in the work function is solely due to the shift in the Fermi level:\n$$ e\\phi(U) - e\\phi(U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}) = (E_{\\mathrm{vac}} - E_F(U)) - (E_{\\mathrm{vac}} - E_F(U_{\\mathrm{PZC}})) $$\n$$ e\\phi(U) - e\\phi(U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}) = E_F(U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}) - E_F(U) $$\nSubstituting the expression for the Fermi level shift:\n$$ e\\phi(U) - e\\phi(U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}) = E_F(U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}) - (E_F(U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}) - e(U - U_{\\mathrm{PZC}})) = e(U - U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}) $$\nDividing by the elementary charge $ e $, we obtain the relationship where potentials are in volts ($V$) and work functions are in electronvolts ($eV$):\n$$ \\phi(U) = \\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} + U - U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $$\nThis expression gives the potential-dependent work function. It correctly returns $ \\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $ when $ U = U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $.\n\n#### 2. Electron Chemical Potential Alignment Descriptor $ \\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{align}}(U) $\nThe descriptor is defined as the difference between the electron chemical potential in the electrode and in the solution, at the same potential $ U $:\n$$ \\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{align}}(U) = \\mu_e^{\\mathrm{electrode}}(U) - \\mu_e^{\\mathrm{solution}}(U) $$\nAll energies are to be expressed in electronvolts ($eV$).\n\nFirst, we express $ \\mu_e^{\\mathrm{electrode}}(U) $. The electron chemical potential (or Fermi level) of a surface, on an absolute energy scale relative to the vacuum level, is the negative of its work function.\n$$ \\mu_e^{\\mathrm{electrode}}(U) = -\\phi(U) $$\nUsing the result from Part 1:\n$$ \\mu_e^{\\mathrm{electrode}}(U) = -(\\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} + U - U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}) $$\n\nNext, we express $ \\mu_e^{\\mathrm{solution}}(U) $. This is the chemical potential of an ideal electron reservoir in the electrolyte that has an equilibrium potential of $ U $ versus SHE. The SHE, by definition, has a potential of $ U=0 $ V. Its absolute electron chemical potential is given as $ \\mu_e(\\text{SHE}) = -U_{\\mathrm{SHE}}^{\\mathrm{abs}} $ (in units of $eV$). For any other potential $ U $ vs SHE, the electron chemical potential is shifted by $ -U $ (in $eV$):\n$$ \\mu_e^{\\mathrm{solution}}(U) = \\mu_e(\\text{SHE}) - U = -U_{\\mathrm{SHE}}^{\\mathrm{abs}} - U $$\n\nNow we can compute the alignment descriptor $ \\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{align}}(U) $:\n$$ \\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{align}}(U) = \\mu_e^{\\mathrm{electrode}}(U) - \\mu_e^{\\mathrm{solution}}(U) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{align}}(U) = -(\\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} + U - U_{\\mathrm{PZC}}) - (-U_{\\mathrm{SHE}}^{\\mathrm{abs}} - U) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{align}}(U) = -\\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} - U + U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} + U_{\\mathrm{SHE}}^{\\mathrm{abs}} + U $$\nThe terms involving the applied potential $ U $ cancel out:\n$$ \\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{align}} = U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} - \\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} + U_{\\mathrm{SHE}}^{\\mathrm{abs}} $$\nAs the derivation shows, the alignment descriptor $ \\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{align}} $ is independent of the applied potential $ U $ under the stated approximations. It is a constant value for each surface termination, defined by its intrinsic properties ($ \\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $, $ U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} $) and the absolute SHE potential.\n\n### Summary of Formulas\n1.  Work function at potential $ U $:\n    $ \\phi(U) \\,[\\text{eV}] = \\phi_{\\mathrm{PZC}} \\,[\\text{eV}] + U \\,[\\text{V}] - U_{\\mathrm{PZC}} \\,[\\text{V}] $\n2.

            "problem": "You are given the task of formalizing the notion of a scaling relation between adsorption energies of oxygen reduction reaction intermediates in computational electrochemistry and of constructing a quantitative, dimensionless scalar that measures the tightness of such a relation. Work within the descriptor-based design paradigm where adsorption energies serve as descriptors to forecast catalytic behavior. Proceed from fundamental, widely accepted definitions in statistics and linear regression to formulate a mathematically rigorous tightness measure based on correlation and residual analysis. Then implement the measure as a program and apply it to the provided datasets.\n\nConstruct a scalar tightness score for a bivariate scaling relation between two adsorption energies, where one is treated as the descriptor and the other as the target. The score must be derived from the following fundamental bases:\n\n- The definition of Pearson product-moment correlation, which for two random variables with realizations $x_i$ and $y_i$ and finite nonzero standard deviations $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$, is given by the correlation between centered variables divided by the product of their standard deviations.\n- The definition of Spearman rank correlation as the Pearson correlation of the rank-transformed variables.\n- Ordinary least squares linear regression of $y$ onto $x$ with an intercept, yielding a line $y = a x + b$ minimizing the sum of squared residuals $\\sum_i \\varepsilon_i^2$, where $\\varepsilon_i = y_i - (a x_i + b)$.\n- Root-mean-square error computed from residuals and an appropriate normalization using the standard deviation of $y$ so that the residual contribution becomes unitless and affine-invariant under rescaling of $y$.\n\nYour score must satisfy all of the following properties, which you must justify from first principles in your derivation:\n\n- It aggregates three contributions: one that increases monotonically with the magnitude of the Pearson correlation, one that increases monotonically with the magnitude of the Spearman correlation, and one that increases as the residual dispersion decreases, using a normalization by a dispersion of $y$ so that it is invariant to affine rescaling of $y$.\n- It is bounded in the closed interval $[0,1]$.\n- It attains the value $1$ for perfectly linear, strictly monotonic relations with zero residuals.\n- It does not increase when a single outlier is introduced that increases the residual dispersion while preserving the overall monotonic trend.\n- It is symmetric under exchanging $x$ and $y$ only in the two correlation contributions, but not necessarily in the residual contribution because the regression is $y$ on $x$.\n\nYou must construct a concrete score that satisfies these properties and implement it algorithmically.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It presents a well-posed task within the established scientific framework of computational materials science and descriptor-based design, specifically in the context of electrocatalysis. The problem is scientifically grounded, relying on fundamental, universally accepted principles of linear algebra and statistics (Pearson and Spearman correlations, Ordinary Least Squares regression). It is objective, complete, and contains no contradictions or ambiguities. It requires the construction of a mathematical object (a scalar score) based on a clear set of axiomatic properties and its application to well-defined synthetic datasets. This constitutes a standard and meaningful exercise in quantitative scientific modeling. We may, therefore, proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe task is to formalize a quantitative, dimensionless scalar, which we shall denote $S$, to measure the \"tightness\" of a bivariate scaling relation between two sets of adsorption energies, treated as a descriptor variable $x$ and a target variable $y$. The score $S$ must be constructed from first principles, satisfying a set of specified properties.\n\nLet the two sets of observations be given by the vectors $\\mathbf{x} = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\}$ and $\\mathbf{y} = \\{y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n\\}$. The tightness score $S$ is formulated as a convex combination of three distinct, normalized contributions, each lying in the interval $[0, 1]$: a Pearson correlation term $C_P$, a Spearman rank correlation term $C_S$, and a normalized residual error term $C_R$. The problem specifies equal emphasis on each contribution, leading to the following form for the score $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{1}{3} (C_P + C_S + C_R)$$\nWe will now derive each component based on the provided requirements.\n\n**1. Pearson Correlation Contribution, $C_P$**\n\nThe Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, $\\rho_{xy}$, measures the degree of linear association between two variables. For samples $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ with means $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$, and standard deviations $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$, it is defined as:\n$$\\rho_{xy} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}$$\nThe value of $\\rho_{xy}$ lies in the interval $[-1, 1]$. The problem requires a contribution that increases monotonically with the magnitude of the correlation. The most direct choice that is bounded in $[0, 1]$ is the absolute value of the Pearson coefficient.\n$$C_P = |\\rho_{xy}|$$\nThis component is $1$ for a perfect linear relationship (either positive or negative) and $0$ for no linear correlation. It is symmetric upon exchange of $x$ and $y$.\n\n**2. Spearman Rank Correlation Contribution, $C_S$**\n\nThe Spearman rank correlation coefficient, $\\rho_S$, measures the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables. It is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient of the rank-transformed variables. Let $R_x(i)$ and $R_y(i)$ be the ranks of $x_i$ and $y_i$ within their respective datasets. Then:\n$$\\rho_S = \\rho_{R_x R_y} = \\frac{\\text{cov}(R_x, R_y)}{\\sigma_{R_x} \\sigma_{R_y}}$$\nLike the Pearson coefficient, $\\rho_S$ lies in $[-1, 1]$. It is less sensitive to outliers than $\\rho_{xy}$ and captures non-linear monotonic trends. To meet the requirement of a score contribution that increases with the magnitude of monotonic correlation, we again use the absolute value:\n$$C_S = |\\rho_S|$$\nThis component is $1$ for any perfect monotonic relationship (linear or not) and $0$ for no monotonic trend. It is also symmetric upon exchange of $x$ and $y$.\n\n**3. Normalized Residual Error Contribution, $C_R$**\n\nThis component quantifies the compactness of the data around a best-fit line, independent of any inherent monotonic trend. It is based on the residuals of an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression of $y$ onto $x$. The OLS procedure finds the parameters $a$ (slope) and $b$ (intercept) for the line $y_{pred} = ax + b$ that minimize the sum of squared residuals, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\varepsilon_i^2$, where the residual for each point is $\\varepsilon_i = y_i - y_{pred,i} = y_i - (ax_i + b)$.\n\nThe dispersion of these residuals is measured by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):\n$$\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\varepsilon_i^2}$$\nTo make this measure dimensionless and invariant to affine transformations of $y$ (i.e., $y' = cy+d$ for $c \\neq 0$), the problem requires normalization by a measure of the dispersion of $y$. The standard deviation of $y$, $\\sigma_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}$, is the appropriate choice. An affine transformation on $y$ transforms $\\text{RMSE}$ to $|c|\\text{RMSE}$ and $\\sigma_y$ to $|c|\\sigma_y$, leaving their ratio, the Normalized RMSE (NRMSE), invariant.\n$$\\text{NRMSE} = \\frac{\\text{RMSE}}{\\sigma_y}$$\nThe contribution $C_R$ must increase as the residual dispersion decreases. A simple form is $1 - \\text{NRMSE}$. For an OLS regression model that includes an intercept term, the sum of squared residuals is always less than or equal to the total sum of squares, i.e., $\\sum \\varepsilon_i^2 \\le \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$. Dividing by $n$ and taking the square root gives $\\text{RMSE} \\le \\sigma_y$. This ensures that $\\text{NRMSE} \\in [0, 1]$ (assuming $\\sigma_y > 0$), and consequently, the contribution term is also bounded in $[0, 1]$. We define it as:\n$$C_R = 1 - \\frac{\\text{RMSE}}{\\sigma_y}$$\nTo be robust, should any numerical instability or edge case lead to $\\text{RMSE} > \\sigma_y$, we can apply the specified rectification: $C_R = \\max(0, 1 - \\text{NRMSE})$. This component reaches its maximum of $1$ when all residuals are zero (perfect fit, $\\text{RMSE}=0$). Unlike $C_P$ and $C_S$, $C_R$ is asymmetric with respect to the exchange of $x$ and $y$, as the regression of $y$ on $x$ is not identical to the regression of $x$ on $y$.\n\n**4. Final Aggregated Score, $S$**\n\nCombining the three components with equal weighting yields the final expression for the tightness score:\n$$S(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( |\\rho_{xy}| + |\\rho_S| + \\left(1 - \\frac{\\text{RMSE}_y}{\\sigma_y}\\right) \\right)$$\nThis score satisfies all the required properties:\n- It aggregates the three specified contributions with equal emphasis via a convex combination.\n- It is bounded in $[0, 1]$ as it is an average of three terms, each in $[0, 1]$.\n- It equals $1$ only when $|\\rho_{xy}|=1$, $|\\rho_S|=1$, and $\\text{RMSE}=0$, which corresponds to a perfect, strictly monotonic linear relationship with zero error.\n- The introduction of an outlier typically increases $\\text{RMSE}$ and decreases $|\\rho_{xy}|$, thus decreasing $C_R$ and $C_P$, which leads to a lower score $S$. The inclusion of the robust Spearman term $C_S$ prevents the score from collapsing if the outlier does not disrupt the overall rank-ordering.\n- The score is asymmetric because the term $C_R$ depends on the choice of $y$ as the dependent variable.\n\nThe following algorithm will be used to compute the score for each dataset and relation.\n1.  For a given pair of vectors $(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})$:\n2.  Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient $\\rho_{xy}$ and set $C_P = |\\rho_{xy}|$.\n3.  Compute the Spearman rank correlation coefficient $\\rho_S$ and set $C_S = |\\rho_S|$.\n4.  Perform an OLS linear regression of $\\mathbf{y}$ on $\\mathbf{x}$ to obtain the predicted values $\\mathbf{y}_{pred}$.\n5.  Calculate the residuals $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{y}_{pred}$.\n6.  Compute the RMSE from the residuals.\n7.  Compute the standard deviation $\\sigma_y$ of the target variable $\\mathbf{y}$.\n8.  If $\\sigma_y > 0$, calculate $C_R = 1 - \\text{RMSE}/\\sigma_y$. If $\\sigma_y=0$, the relation is perfectly flat; both $\\mathrm{RMSE}$ and $\\sigma_y$ are $0$. In this degenerate case, $C_R$ is taken to be $1$ as prediction error is zero.\n9.  Calculate the final score $S = (C_P + C_S + C_R) / 3$.\nThis procedure is applied to the nine specified relations across the three datasets.",

            "problem": "You are tasked with constructing and evaluating a mathematically explicit, descriptor-based counterfactual in computational electrochemistry that isolates how a single interfacial descriptor can shift the hydroxyl adsorption energy while leaving the oxygen adsorption energy essentially unchanged. Your derivation and program must be grounded in first principles and yield numerically testable outcomes.\n\nConsider the descriptor-based decomposition of the adsorption energy on a transition-metal surface site for an adsorbate species $X \\in \\{\\mathrm{OH}, \\mathrm{O}\\}$ in terms of a chemisorption component that depends on the metal electronic structure descriptor (for instance, the $d$-band center $\\varepsilon_d$) and an interfacial electrostatic component that depends on the interfacial electric field $F$ and the adsorbate-specific surface-normal dipole moment $\\mu_X$. We assume the chemisorption energy depends only on $\\varepsilon_d$ (which you will hold constant in the counterfactual), and the field-dependent energy depends only on $F$ and $\\mu_X$. The physical premise is that the oxygen adatom has a negligible surface-normal dipole moment, while the hydroxyl has a finite surface-normal dipole moment due to its polar $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond and interfacial orientation. This premise is widely supported by adsorption studies and is consistent with electrostatic interactions in an external field.\n\nYour tasks are:\n\n- Derive from first principles the change in adsorption energy $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(X)$ between two field values $F_0$ and $F_1$, holding $\\varepsilon_d$ fixed, using only the electrostatic interaction of a dipole with an external electric field and a descriptor-based decomposition of adsorption energy. Do not use or assume any shortcut or target formula beyond these fundamental bases. Express all energies in electronvolts ($\\mathrm{eV}$), all fields in volts per angstrom ($\\mathrm{V/\\AA}$), and all dipole moments either in Debye or converted to units of elementary charge times angstrom ($\\mathrm{e\\AA}$); if given in Debye, you must internally convert using $1\\,\\mathrm{Debye} = 0.20819434\\,\\mathrm{e\\AA}$.\n- Design the counterfactual modification in which only the interfacial field descriptor $F$ is changed from $F_0$ to $F_1$, while keeping the chemisorption descriptor $\\varepsilon_d$ fixed (hence the chemisorption contribution cancels in the difference). Use the physical mechanism that the field couples to the surface-normal dipole of $\\mathrm{OH}$ but not to $\\mathrm{O}$ to enable decoupling.\n- Implement a complete, runnable program that, for each test case in the suite below, computes the changes $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\mathrm{OH})$ and $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\mathrm{O})$ in $\\mathrm{eV}$ resulting from changing $F$ from $F_0$ to $F_1$, and evaluates whether the decoupling criterion is satisfied.

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It presents a formalizable task directly relevant to the field of computational electrochemistry and descriptor-based materials design. All necessary data, physical premises, and constraints are provided without contradiction or ambiguity.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the change in adsorption energy from fundamental principles, then applying this derivation to implement the specified counterfactual analysis.\n\nThe adsorption energy, $E_{\\mathrm{ads}}$, for an adsorbate species $X$ on a metal surface is modeled as a sum of a chemisorption component, $E_{\\mathrm{chem}}$, and an electrostatic component, $E_{\\mathrm{elec}}$. The chemisorption component is a function of an electronic structure descriptor, such as the $d$-band center $\\varepsilon_d$, while the electrostatic component depends on the interfacial electric field, $F$, and the adsorbate's surface-normal dipole moment, $\\mu_X$. The total adsorption energy is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(X, \\varepsilon_d, F) = E_{\\mathrm{chem}}(X, \\varepsilon_d) + E_{\\mathrm{elec}}(X, F, \\mu_X)$$\nThe problem defines a counterfactual scenario where only the interfacial field descriptor $F$ is varied from an initial value $F_0$ to a final value $F_1$, while the chemisorption descriptor $\\varepsilon_d$ is held constant. We are tasked with deriving the resulting change in adsorption energy, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(X)$.\n\nFrom first principles of electrostatics, the interaction energy of a static electric dipole moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ with a uniform external electric field $\\vec{F}$ is given by $U = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{F}$. For the purpose of this model, we consider only the components normal to the surface. Thus, the electrostatic contribution to the adsorption energy is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{elec}}(X, F, \\mu_X) = -\\mu_X F$$\nFor this equation to be dimensionally consistent and yield energy in electronvolts ($\\mathrm{eV}$), the units must be managed correctly. If the field $F$ is in volts per angstrom ($\\mathrm{V/\\AA}$) and the dipole moment $\\mu_X$ is in units of elementary charge times angstrom ($\\mathrm{e\\AA}$), their product directly gives energy in $\\mathrm{eV}$:\n$$[\\mathrm{e\\AA}] \\times [\\mathrm{V/\\AA}] = [\\mathrm{e}] \\times [\\mathrm{V}] = [\\mathrm{eV}]$$\nThe problem provides dipole moments in units of Debye ($\\mathrm{D}$). We must use the specified conversion factor, $k_{\\mathrm{conv}} = 0.20819434\\,\\mathrm{e\\AA}/\\mathrm{D}$, to convert the dipole moment $\\mu_X[\\mathrm{D}]$ into the required units:\n$$\\mu_X[\\mathrm{e\\AA}] = \\mu_X[\\mathrm{D}] \\times k_{\\mathrm{conv}}$$\n\nThe change in adsorption energy, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(X)$, is the difference between the final and initial states:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(X) = E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(X, \\varepsilon_d, F_1) - E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(X, \\varepsilon_d, F_0)$$\nSubstituting the decomposed expression for $E_{\\mathrm{ads}}$:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(X) = [E_{\\mathrm{chem}}(X, \\varepsilon_d) + E_{\\mathrm{elec}}(X, F_1, \\mu_X)] - [E_{\\mathrm{chem}}(X, \\varepsilon_d) + E_{\\mathrm{elec}}(X, F_0, \\mu_X)]$$\nSince $\\varepsilon_d$ is held constant, the chemisorption term $E_{\\mathrm{chem}}(X, \\varepsilon_d)$ cancels out:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(X) = E_{\\mathrm{elec}}(X, F_1, \\mu_X) - E_{\\mathrm{elec}}(X, F_0, \\mu_X)$$\nNow, substituting the electrostatic energy expression $E_{\\mathrm{elec}} = -\\mu_X F$:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(X) = (-\\mu_X F_1) - (-\\mu_X F_0)$$\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(X) = -\\mu_X (F_1 - F_0) = -\\mu_X \\Delta F$$\nThis is the final derived equation. To use it computationally with the given units, we write it as:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(X)[\\mathrm{eV}] = - (\\mu_X[\\mathrm{D}] \\times k_{\\mathrm{conv}}) \\times (F_1[\\mathrm{V/\\AA}] - F_0[\\mathrm{V/\\AA}])$$\nThis formula embodies the counterfactual: it isolates the effect of changing the field descriptor $F$ on the adsorption energy. The effect is linearly proportional to the adsorbate's intrinsic dipole moment, $\\mu_X$.\n\nThe physical premise of the problem is that for oxygen, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{O}} \\approx 0$, while for hydroxyl, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}}$ is finite. Applying our derived formula:\n- For oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}$): $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\mathrm{O}) = -\\mu_{\\mathrm{O}} \\Delta F$. If $\\mu_{\\mathrm{O}} \\approx 0$, then $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\mathrm{O}) \\approx 0$.\n- For hydroxyl ($\\mathrm{OH}$): $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\mathrm{OH}) = -\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}} \\Delta F$. Since $\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}}$ is finite, any change in field ($\\Delta F \\neq 0$) will induce a change in its adsorption energy.\n\nThis demonstrates the selective decoupling: varying the field $F$ primarily influences the adsorption energy of $\\mathrm{OH}$ while leaving that of $\\mathrm{O}$ largely unchanged. The program will implement this formula for the species $\\mathrm{OH}$ and $\\mathrm{O}$ for each test case. It will then evaluate the decoupling criterion, which is the logical condition:\n$$(\\left|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\mathrm{O})\\right| \\le \\tau) \\land (\\left|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\mathrm{OH})\\right| \\ge \\sigma)$$\nwhere $\\tau$ and $\\sigma$ are the given tolerance and significance thresholds, respectively. The program will compute the two energy changes and the boolean result of this criterion for each test case.",
