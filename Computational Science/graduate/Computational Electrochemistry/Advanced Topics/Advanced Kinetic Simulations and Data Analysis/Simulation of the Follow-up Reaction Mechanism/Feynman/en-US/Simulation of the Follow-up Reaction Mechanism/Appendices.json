The governing partial differential equation is Fick's second law modified with a first-order reaction term, which is a fundamental concept in physical chemistry and transport phenomena. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear objective and sufficient, consistent information to achieve it. The language is objective and precise. All given parameters have realistic values. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the concentration profile of a species $R$ that is produced at an electrode and subsequently consumed by a first-order chemical reaction.\n\n**(a) Derivation of the diffusion-reaction layer thickness $\\delta_{c}$**\n\nThe governing equation for the concentration of the reduced intermediate, $C_R(x,t)$, is the reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C_{R}}{\\partial t} = D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} C_{R}}{\\partial x^{2}} - k_{c}\\,C_{R}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that we are interested in the behavior at \"late times\". This corresponds to a situation where the system has evolved for a duration much longer than the characteristic timescale of the chemical reaction, which is $1/k_c$. In this regime, a quasi-steady state is established near the electrode. In this quasi-steady state, the rate of change of concentration with time, $\\partial C_{R}/\\partial t$, becomes negligible compared to the processes of diffusion and reaction.\n\nThe dominant-balance argument thus posits that the diffusion term and the reaction term are of a comparable magnitude within a characteristic layer near the electrode. This balance dictates the spatial extent of the layer. Setting the time derivative to zero, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\nD\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} C_{R}}{\\partial x^{2}} \\approx k_{c}\\,C_{R}\n$$\nWe can estimate the order of magnitude of the second spatial derivative using a characteristic length scale, which we will call $\\delta_c$. Over this length scale, the concentration $C_R$ changes significantly from its value at the electrode to nearly zero. Therefore, we can write the scaling relation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} C_{R}}{\\partial x^{2}} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta C_R}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\sim \\frac{C_R}{\\delta_c^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this scaling into the balanced equation gives:\n$$\nD\\,\\frac{C_R}{\\delta_c^2} \\sim k_c\\,C_R\n$$\nAssuming $C_R$ is non-zero within this layer, we can cancel it from both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{\\delta_c^2} \\sim k_c\n$$\nSolving for the characteristic thickness $\\delta_c$ of the diffusion-reaction layer, we obtain:\n$$\n\\delta_c^2 = \\frac{D}{k_c} \\implies \\delta_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k_c}}\n$$\nThis expression represents the distance over which the species $R$ can diffuse before it is consumed by the reaction.\n\n**(b) Numerical computation of $\\delta_{c}$**\n\nWe are given the values for the diffusion coefficient and the rate constant:\n$D = 1.0\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$\n$k_{c} = 250\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\delta_{c}$:\n$$\n\\delta_{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.0\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}}{250\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}} = \\sqrt{0.004 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_{c} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in micrometers ($\\mathrm{\\mu m}$), where $1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\n\\delta_{c} = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}\n$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures as requested by the problem statement, we have:\n$$\n\\delta_{c} = 2.00\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}\n$$\n\n**(c) Assessment of the quasi-steady approximation**\n\nThe quasi-steady approximation is valid if the transient term, $\\partial C_R/\\partial t$, is much smaller than the diffusion and reaction terms. We are asked to quantify this by computing the ratio $\\mathcal{R}(t^{\\ast})$ at $t^{\\ast} = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\nThe ratio is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(t^{\\ast}) = \\frac{\\big|\\partial C_{R}/\\partial t\\big|}{\\max\\left\\{D\\,\\big|\\partial^{2} C_{R}/\\partial x^{2}\\big|,\\,k_{c}\\,|C_{R}|\\right\\}}\n$$\nWe use the provided scaling relations: $\\partial C_{R}/\\partial t \\sim C_{R}/t^{\\ast}$ and $\\partial^{2} C_{R}/\\partial x^{2} \\sim C_{R}/\\delta_{c}^{2}$.\nFirst, we evaluate the terms in the denominator. The diffusion term scales as $D\\,\\big|\\partial^{2} C_{R}/\\partial x^{2}\\big| \\sim D\\,|C_R|/\\delta_c^2$. The reaction term scales as $k_c\\,|C_R|$.\nFrom our derivation of $\\delta_c$ in part (a), we established that these two terms are of the same order of magnitude in the reaction layer, since $\\delta_c^2 = D/k_c$, which implies $D/\\delta_c^2 = k_c$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\max\\left\\{D\\,\\frac{|C_R|}{\\delta_c^2},\\,k_c\\,|C_R|\\right\\} = k_c\\,|C_R| = \\frac{D}{\\delta_c^2}\\,|C_R|\n$$\nNow we can write the ratio $\\mathcal{R}(t^{\\ast})$ using the scaling relations:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(t^{\\ast}) \\sim \\frac{|C_R| / t^{\\ast}}{k_c\\,|C_R|}\n$$\nThe concentration scale $|C_R|$ cancels out, yielding:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(t^{\\ast}) \\sim \\frac{1}{k_c t^{\\ast}}\n$$\nWe are given $k_{c} = 250\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and $t^{\\ast} = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(0.50\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\sim \\frac{1}{(250\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (0.50\\ \\mathrm{s})} = \\frac{1}{125} = 0.0080\n$$\nThe value of the ratio $\\mathcal{R}(t^{\\ast})$ is $0.0080$, which is significantly less than $1$. This indicates that at $t^{\\ast} = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{s}$, the magnitude of the transient term $\\partial C_R/\\partial t$ is less than $1\\%$ of the magnitude of the diffusion and reaction terms. The condition for late times, $t \\gg 1/k_c$, is well satisfied, as $t^{\\ast} = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{s}$ while the reaction timescale is $1/k_c = 1/250\\ \\mathrm{s} = 0.004\\ \\mathrm{s}$. The small value of $\\mathcal{R}$ quantitatively confirms that the system is in a quasi-steady state, and neglecting the time derivative is a justified approximation for describing the concentration profile within the reaction layer at this time.\n\nThe final reported answer is the numerical value of $\\delta_c$ from part (b).",

            "solution": "The user has provided a well-posed boundary value problem from the field of computational electrochemistry and has requested a numerical solution using a specific shooting method. The problem is scientifically grounded, mathematically consistent, and all required parameters are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe problem describes the steady-state concentration profile, $C_R(x)$, of a reduced species in a semi-infinite one-dimensional domain $x \\ge 0$ adjacent to an electrode. The species undergoes simultaneous Fickian diffusion and a first-order homogeneous chemical reaction. The governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:\n$$D\\,\\frac{d^2 C_R}{dx^2} - k_c\\,C_R = 0$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $k_c$ is the reaction rate constant. The domain is numerically approximated as the finite interval $[0, L]$.\n\nThe boundary conditions are of a mixed type. At the far end of the domain, the concentration vanishes:\n$$C_R(L) = 0$$\nAt the electrode surface ($x=0$), a Robin-type boundary condition models mixed control by interfacial kinetics and mass transport:\n$$-D\\,\\frac{dC_R}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = k_{\\mathrm{int}}\\left(C_R(0) - C_R^\\ast\\right)$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is an interfacial mass-transfer rate constant and $C_R^\\ast$ is a reference concentration.\n\nThe task is to find the surface concentration, $C_R(0)$.\n\nTo facilitate numerical integration, the second-order ODE is transformed into a system of two first-order ODEs. We define a state vector $\\mathbf{y}(x) = [y_1(x), y_2(x)]^T$, where:\n$$y_1(x) = C_R(x)$$\n$$y_2(x) = \\frac{dC_R}{dx}(x)$$\nThe system of ODEs is then:\n$$\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dx} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{dy_1}{dx} \\\\ \\frac{dy_2}{dx} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\ \\frac{k_c}{D}\\,y_1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis is a linear, homogeneous system of the form $\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dx} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{y}$, with the matrix $\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ k_c/D & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe boundary conditions in terms of $\\mathbf{y}(x)$ are:\n1. $y_1(L) = 0$\n2. $-D\\,y_2(0) = k_{\\mathrm{int}}\\left(y_1(0) - C_R^\\ast\\right)$\n\nThis constitutes a two-point boundary value problem (BVP). We will solve it using a shooting method. The core idea of a shooting method is to convert the BVP into an initial value problem (IVP) by guessing the missing initial conditions, integrating the system, and then iteratively adjusting the guesses until the boundary condition at the other end is satisfied.\n\nHere, the unknown initial value is $s := y_1(0) = C_R(0)$. The second initial value, $y_2(0)$, can be expressed in terms of $s$ by rearranging the Robin boundary condition:\n$$y_2(0) = -\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{int}}}{D}\\left(y_1(0) - C_R^\\ast\\right) = -\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{int}}}{D}\\left(s - C_R^\\ast\\right)$$\nThus, the IVP is fully specified for any given guess $s$. The objective is to find the value of $s$ for which the solution of the IVP, integrated from $x=0$ to $x=L$, satisfies the terminal condition $y_1(L) = 0$.\n\nLet $y_1(L; s)$ denote the solution for $y_1$ at $x=L$ for an initial guess $s$. We are looking for the root of the function $f(s) = y_1(L; s) = 0$.\n\nA crucial feature of this problem is the linearity of the governing ODE and the affine dependence of the initial conditions on the shooting parameter $s$.\nThe initial condition vector is:\n$$\\mathbf{y}(0) = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1(0) \\\\ y_2(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} s \\\\ -\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{int}}}{D}(s - C_R^\\ast) \\end{pmatrix} = s \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -k_{\\mathrm{int}}/D \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ k_{\\mathrm{int}}C_R^\\ast/D \\end{pmatrix}$$\nDue to the superposition principle for linear ODEs, the solution at any $x$ is also an affine function of $s$. In particular, the terminal value $y_1(L; s)$ is a linear function of $s$:\n$$y_1(L; s) = m s + b$$\nwhere $m$ and $b$ are constants. Instead of using a general iterative root-finding algorithm, we can determine this linear function exactly by performing just two 'shots' and then solving for its root algebraically.\n\nFollowing the problem's prescription, we perform two integrations:\n1.  **Shot 1:** Let $s_1 = 0$. Integrate the IVP with initial condition $\\mathbf{y}^{(1)}(0) = [0, k_{\\mathrm{int}}C_R^\\ast/D]^T$. Let the resulting terminal value be $y_{L,1} = y_1(L; s=0)$. From our linear model, $y_{L,1} = m(0) + b = b$.\n2.  **Shot 2:** Let $s_2 = 1$. Integrate the IVP with initial condition $\\mathbf{y}^{(2)}(0) = [1, -k_{\\mathrm{int}}(1-C_R^\\ast)/D]^T$. Let the resulting terminal value be $y_{L,2} = y_1(L; s=1)$. From our linear model, $y_{L,2} = m(1) + b = m + b$.\n\nFrom these two results, we find the constants $b = y_{L,1}$ and $m = y_{L,2} - b = y_{L,2} - y_{L,1}$.\nThe function is $y_1(L; s) = (y_{L,2} - y_{L,1})s + y_{L,1}$.\nWe now find the correct value of $s$ by setting $y_1(L; s) = 0$:\n$$(y_{L,2} - y_{L,1})s + y_{L,1} = 0$$\n$$s = -\\frac{y_{L,1}}{y_{L,2} - y_{L,1}}$$\nThis value of $s$ is the desired surface concentration $C_R(0)$.\n\nThe numerical implementation will involve defining a function for the right-hand side of the ODE system. For each test case, this function will be integrated twice from $x=0$ to $x=L$ using a standard numerical solver (`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`), once for $s=0$ and once for $s=1$.

            "problem": "Consider an electron transfer followed by a first-order chemical reaction (EC mechanism) at a planar electrode under semi-infinite diffusion during cyclic voltammetry. The mechanism is $O + e^- \\rightleftharpoons R$ at the electrode surface followed by a homogeneous decay $R \\xrightarrow{k_c} P$ in the diffusion layer, where $P$ is electro-inactive on the time scale of the experiment. Assume the electron transfer kinetics obey the Butler–Volmer relation with standard heterogeneous rate constant $k^0$ and transfer coefficient $\\alpha$, the diffusion coefficients of $O$ and $R$ are equal to $D$, the bulk concentration of $O$ is $c^*$, the electrode area is $A$, the temperature is $T$, the gas constant is $R$ (the constant in thermodynamics), and the Faraday constant is $F$. The applied potential is a triangular waveform of scan rate $v$ centered at the formal potential $E^0$, and the double-layer and ohmic effects are compensated to negligible levels. The concentration fields obey one-dimensional diffusion with consumption of $R$ by the chemical reaction.\n\nStarting from the diffusion equation $\\partial c_i/\\partial t = D\\, \\partial^2 c_i/\\partial x^2$ in the semi-infinite domain $x \\ge 0$, the first-order decay term for $R$ in the bulk $\\partial c_R/\\partial t = D\\, \\partial^2 c_R/\\partial x^2 - k_c\\, c_R$, and the interfacial boundary condition that equates the normal flux to the Butler–Volmer reaction rate at $x=0$,\n$$\n\\frac{j(t)}{n F} = k^0\\left[c_O(0,t)\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{F \\eta(t)}{R T}\\right) - c_R(0,t)\\,\\exp\\!\\left((1-\\alpha)\\frac{F \\eta(t)}{R T}\\right)\\right],\n$$\nwith overpotential $\\eta(t) = E(t)-E^0$, non-dimensionalize the problem by choosing the time scale $t_v = R T/(F v)$, the diffusive length scale $\\ell_D = \\sqrt{D\\, t_v}$, the concentration scale $c^*$, and the dimensionless time $\\tau = t/t_v$, space $\\xi = x/\\ell_D$, concentrations $\\tilde{c}_i = c_i/c^*$, and overpotential $\\tilde{\\eta}(\\tau) = (F/R T)\\,\\eta(t)$.

Explain why this is a structural non-identifiability of $\\left(k^0, k_c\\right)$ from a single-scan-rate cyclic voltammetry experiment.\n\nWhich of the following additional experimental designs, when analyzed by global fitting against a mechanistic model consistent with the above definitions and assumptions, can break this structural non-identifiability and enable separate estimation of $k^0$ and $k_c$ without introducing ad hoc priors on $\\left(k^0, k_c\\right)$? Select all that apply.\n\nA. Record a single cyclic voltammogram at the same scan rate $v$ as above but expand the potential window sufficiently to include both oxidation and reduction diffusion-limited plateaus, and then fit the entire curve.\n\nB. Record cyclic voltammograms at multiple scan rates $v$ spanning at least $2$ decades, and perform a single global fit across all scan rates, constraining $k^0$ and $k_c$ to be constant across the data while allowing the model to account for the $v$-dependence via the non-dimensional groups that emerge from the scaling.\n\nC. At fixed scan rate $v$, perform a temperature series over which both $k^0$ and $k_c$ vary with $T$, but fit each temperature independently without imposing any functional dependence of $k^0(T)$ or $k_c(T)$.\n\nD. Complement one or more cyclic voltammograms with a double potential-step chronoamperometry experiment in which the forward step generates $R$ and the reverse step is applied at a controlled delay; use the early-time ($t \\ll 1/k_c$) portion of the forward-step current to estimate $k^0$ (where the chemical step is kinetically silent), then fix $k^0$ to extract $k_c$ from the longer-time behavior.\n\nE.

The triangular waveform enters only through $\\tilde{\\eta}(\\tau)$, whose slope is unity in $\\tau$ by design. Therefore, once concentrations are normalized by $c^*$ and time-space variables by $t_v$ and $\\ell_D$, the forward model for the normalized cyclic voltammetry shape depends on the kinetic constants $k^0$ and $k_c$ only through the combinations $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$ (along with known $\\alpha$ and the known waveform protocol).\n\nConsequently, if one performs a single-scan-rate cyclic voltammetry experiment at scan rate $v$ and fits only the normalized shape (with amplitude scaling given by $n F A D c^*/\\ell_D$), the data can at best identify $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$. For any pair $\\left(k^0,k_c\\right)$ that yields the same $\\left(\\kappa,\\lambda\\right)$ at the chosen $v$ and $T$,\n$$\nk^0 \\sqrt{\\frac{t_v}{D}} = \\kappa^\\star, \\qquad k_c t_v = \\lambda^\\star,\n$$\nthe model-predicted normalized cyclic voltammetry will be the same. This means there is a one-to-one map from $\\left(\\kappa,\\lambda\\right)$ to equivalence classes of $\\left(k^0,k_c\\right)$ given $v$, $T$, and $D$. Thus, the Jacobian of the forward model with respect to $\\left(k^0,k_c\\right)$ has rank $2$ only through these combinations, and the Fisher information matrix in $\\left(k^0,k_c\\right)$ is rank-deficient when considering a single $v$. This is the structural non-identifiability: distinct $\\left(k^0,k_c\\right)$ values that keep $\\left(\\kappa,\\lambda\\right)$ fixed produce indistinguishable cyclic voltammetry shapes after trivial scaling, so no amount of noise reduction or repeated trials at the same $v$ will break the degeneracy.\n\nTo resolve this, one must change the experimental inputs so that the map from $\\left(k^0,k_c\\right)$ to observables is not compressible to the same two combinations at a fixed operating point, or add complementary measurements that isolate one parameter on a time scale where the other is inactive.\n\nWe now analyze each option.\n\nOption A: Record a single cyclic voltammogram at the same scan rate $v$ but expand the potential window to include plateaus. Extending the potential range changes the range of $\\tilde{\\eta}(\\tau)$ but leaves the non-dimensionalization intact. The normalized shape still depends only on $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$ at the given $v$, and the plateau currents primarily reveal transport and geometric scales ($A$, $D$, $c^*$) rather than distinguishing $k^0$ from $k_c$. Because $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$ are unchanged at fixed $v$, the structural non-identifiability persists. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption B: Record cyclic voltammograms at multiple scan rates spanning at least $2$ decades and perform a global fit with $k^0$ and $k_c$ constant across all datasets. Changing $v$ changes $t_v = R T/(F v)$, and hence changes the dimensionless groups in different ways: $\\kappa(v) = k^0 \\sqrt{t_v/D} \\propto v^{-1/2}$ while $\\lambda(v) = k_c t_v \\propto v^{-1}$. A single pair $\\left(k^0,k_c\\right)$ induces a characteristic and distinct dependence of the cyclic voltammetry shape on $v$ through these different scalings. Attempting to mimic the same family of shapes with a different pair $\\left(k^0{}',k_c{}'\\right)$ would require matching both the $v^{-1/2}$ and $v^{-1}$ trends simultaneously across the entire range, which generically forces $k^0{}'=k^0$ and $k_c{}'=k_c$ when fitting globally. In identifiability terms, concatenating experiments at different $v$ increases the rank of the sensitivity matrix with respect to $\\left(k^0,k_c\\right)$ because the two parameters now excite linearly independent directions in the experiment space via their distinct $v$-dependencies. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption C: At fixed scan rate $v$, perform a temperature series but fit each temperature independently without imposing functional dependence $k^0(T)$ or $k_c(T)$. Varying $T$ changes both $t_v$ and intrinsic rates. If one fits each temperature independently with free parameters $\\left(k^0(T),k_c(T)\\right)$ without linking them, each dataset at its own $T$ suffers the same structural non-identifiability described above: only $\\kappa(T)$ and $\\lambda(T)$ are identified at that $T$. Without a structural link across temperatures (for example, committing to specific functional forms for $k^0(T)$ and $k_c(T)$ and sharing parameters globally), the degeneracy is not broken. Therefore, as stated, this design does not resolve the non-identifiability. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption D: Combine cyclic voltammetry with double potential-step chronoamperometry and use early-time data to estimate $k^0$. In a potential-step experiment, immediately after the step the time scale is $t \\to 0^+$ so that $t \\ll 1/k_c$ if $k_c$ is finite. On this short time scale, the homogeneous decay term $-k_c c_R$ is negligible, and the response is governed by interfacial electron transfer kinetics coupled to diffusion. Thus, the early-time current transient provides sensitivity to $k^0$ independent of $k_c$. One can fit the early-time region to estimate $k^0$ (given $D$ and $A$), then use this $k^0$ in the cyclic voltammetry model to extract $k_c$ from features that depend on $\\lambda = k_c t_v$. This strategy exploits time-scale separation to isolate parameters on different experiments, thereby breaking the degeneracy without invoking ad hoc priors. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption E: Repeat the single-scan-rate cyclic voltammetry at different bulk concentrations $c^*$ and rescale the current by $c^*$. In the non-dimensionalization, $c^*$ drops out of the normalized shape, affecting only the current amplitude through $n F A D c^*/\\ell_D$. Rescaling by $c^*$ collapses the amplitude but does not introduce any new sensitivity to $k^0$ versus $k_c$, since $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$ are independent of $c^*$. Therefore, this does not break the non-identifiability. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nIn summary, changing the scan rate over a wide range and performing a global fit (Option B) exploits the distinct $v$-scaling of the electron transfer and chemical steps in the dimensionless groups, while adding a time-resolved potential-step experiment and using short-time data (Option D) leverages time-scale separation to isolate $k^0$. Both approaches fundamentally alter the mapping from $\\left(k^0,k_c\\right)$ to observables so that the two parameters become structurally identifiable.",
