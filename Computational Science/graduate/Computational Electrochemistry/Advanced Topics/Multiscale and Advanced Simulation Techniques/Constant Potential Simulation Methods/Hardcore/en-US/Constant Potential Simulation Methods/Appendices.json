The region $z>0$ contains no free charge other than the point charge. \n\nUsing only the fundamental electrostatic relations, namely Poisson’s equation $\\nabla^{2}\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\rho(\\mathbf{r})/\\varepsilon$ with $\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = q\\,\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{q})$ and the standard boundary condition for a perfect conductor at fixed potential, proceed as follows:\n- Use the method of images and the electrostatic uniqueness theorem to construct the unique electrostatic potential $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$ in the half-space $z>0$ that satisfies $\\Phi(x,y,0)=V_{0}$ and $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) \\to V_{0}$ as $|\\mathbf{r}|\\to \\infty$.\n- From your $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$, compute the induced surface charge density $\\sigma(\\rho)$ on the electrode at $z=0$, where $\\rho=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ is the radial distance from the point $(0,0,0)$ directly beneath the charge.

            "solution": "The problem statement is analyzed and found to be valid. It is a well-posed problem in electrostatics, grounded in fundamental principles (Poisson's equation, method of images), with a complete and consistent set of conditions. The problem is scientifically sound and its terms are objective and precisely defined.\n\nThe problem asks for the total charge induced on an infinite conducting plate at potential $V_{0}$ due to a point charge $q$ located at a distance $a$ from the plate. We will solve this using the method of images.\n\nFirst, we construct the electrostatic potential $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$ for the half-space $z>0$. The potential must satisfy Poisson's equation, $\\nabla^{2}\\Phi = -q\\,\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{q})/\\varepsilon$, and the boundary conditions $\\Phi(x,y,0)=V_{0}$ and $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) \\to V_{0}$ as $|\\mathbf{r}|\\to\\infty$.\n\nBy the principle of superposition, we can express the potential $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$ as the sum of two potentials: $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\Phi_{\\text{image}}(\\mathbf{r}) + \\Phi_{\\text{offset}}(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\n$1$. $\\Phi_{\\text{image}}(\\mathbf{r})$ is the potential that solves the problem for a grounded plate, i.e., with the boundary condition $\\Phi(x,y,0)=0$. For a point charge $q$ at $\\mathbf{r}_{q} = (0,0,a)$, we place an image charge $q'=-q$ at $\\mathbf{r}_{q'} = (0,0,-a)$. The potential in the region $z>0$ is the superposition of the potentials of these two charges in a uniform medium of permittivity $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\text{image}}(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{q}{|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_{q}|} + \\frac{-q}{|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_{q'}|} \\right) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+(z-a)^{2}}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+(z+a)^{2}}} \\right)\n$$\nThis potential satisfies $\\nabla^{2}\\Phi_{\\text{image}} = -q\\,\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{q})/\\varepsilon$ for $z>0$, and at the plane $z=0$, it is $\\Phi_{\\text{image}}(x,y,0)=0$.\n\n$2$. $\\Phi_{\\text{offset}}(\\mathbf{r})$ is a potential that satisfies Laplace's equation $\\nabla^{2}\\Phi_{\\text{offset}}=0$ in the region $z>0$ and adjusts the boundary condition. We need the total potential to be $V_{0}$ at $z=0$. We choose $\\Phi_{\\text{offset}}(\\mathbf{r}) = V_{0}$. This is a constant potential, so $\\nabla^{2}V_{0}=0$ is satisfied, and it provides the necessary offset.\n\nThe total potential for $z>0$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\Phi(x,y,z) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+(z-a)^{2}}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+(z+a)^{2}}} \\right) + V_{0}\n$$\nThis potential satisfies all the conditions of the problem: it reduces to $V_{0}$ at $z=0$, approaches $V_{0}$ as $|\\mathbf{r}|\\to\\infty$, and satisfies Poisson's equation for the single charge $q$ in the region $z>0$. By the uniqueness theorem, this is the correct and unique solution for the potential.\n\nNext, we compute the induced surface charge density $\\sigma$ on the electrode at $z=0$. The relationship is given as $\\sigma = \\varepsilon\\,\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$, where $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla\\Phi$ and the normal vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$ points from the conductor into the region $z>0$, so $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. Thus, $\\sigma = \\varepsilon E_{z}|_{z=0}$.\n\nThe electric field is $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla\\Phi = -\\nabla(\\Phi_{\\text{image}} + V_{0}) = -\\nabla\\Phi_{\\text{image}}$, since the gradient of a constant is zero. The constant potential $V_{0}$ does not contribute to the electric field or the induced charge density.\nThe $z$-component of the electric field is:\n$$\nE_{z} = -\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{\\partial\\Phi_{\\text{image}}}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( (x^{2}+y^{2}+(z-a)^{2})^{-1/2} - (x^{2}+y^{2}+(z+a)^{2})^{-1/2} \\right)\n$$\nPerforming the differentiation:\n$$\nE_{z} = -\\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\left( -\\frac{z-a}{(x^{2}+y^{2}+(z-a)^{2})^{3/2}} + \\frac{z+a}{(x^{2}+y^{2}+(z+a)^{2})^{3/2}} \\right)\n$$\nWe evaluate $E_{z}$ at the surface of the conductor, $z=0$:\n$$\nE_{z}(x,y,0) = -\\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{a}{(x^{2}+y^{2}+a^{2})^{3/2}} + \\frac{a}{(x^{2}+y^{2}+a^{2})^{3/2}} \\right) = -\\frac{2aq}{4\\pi\\varepsilon(x^{2}+y^{2}+a^{2})^{3/2}}\n$$\n$$\nE_{z}(x,y,0) = -\\frac{aq}{2\\pi\\varepsilon(x^{2}+y^{2}+a^{2})^{3/2}}\n$$\nThe surface charge density $\\sigma$ is then:\n$$\n\\sigma(x,y) = \\varepsilon E_{z}(x,y,0) = \\varepsilon \\left( -\\frac{aq}{2\\pi\\varepsilon(x^{2}+y^{2}+a^{2})^{3/2}} \\right) = -\\frac{aq}{2\\pi(x^{2}+y^{2}+a^{2})^{3/2}}\n$$\nIn terms of the radial distance $\\rho = \\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ on the plane, the charge density is:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\rho) = -\\frac{aq}{2\\pi(\\rho^{2}+a^{2})^{3/2}}\n$$\nFinally, we integrate $\\sigma(\\rho)$ over the entire plane $z=0$ to find the total induced charge $Q_{\\mathrm{ind}}$. We use polar coordinates $(\\rho, \\phi)$, where the differential area element is $dA = \\rho\\,d\\rho\\,d\\phi$.\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{ind}} = \\iint_{\\text{plane}} \\sigma(\\rho) \\, dA = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( -\\frac{aq}{2\\pi(\\rho^{2}+a^{2})^{3/2}} \\right) \\rho\\,d\\rho\\,d\\phi\n$$\nThe integral over $\\phi$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$ gives a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{ind}} = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{\\infty} -\\frac{aq}{2\\pi(\\rho^{2}+a^{2})^{3/2}} \\rho\\,d\\rho = -aq \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\rho}{(\\rho^{2}+a^{2})^{3/2}} d\\rho\n$$\nTo solve the remaining integral, we use the substitution $u = \\rho^{2}+a^{2}$, so $du = 2\\rho\\,d\\rho$, which means $\\rho\\,d\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}du$. The limits of integration for $u$ are from $a^{2}$ (when $\\rho=0$) to $\\infty$ (when $\\rho\\to\\infty$).\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\rho}{(\\rho^{2}+a^{2})^{3/2}} d\\rho = \\int_{a^{2}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^{3/2}} \\frac{1}{2}du = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{u^{-1/2}}{-1/2} \\right]_{a^{2}}^{\\infty} = -[u^{-1/2}]_{a^{2}}^{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\n= -\\left( \\lim_{u\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{u}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^{2}}} \\right) = -(0 - \\frac{1}{a}) = \\frac{1}{a}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $Q_{\\mathrm{ind}}$:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{ind}} = -aq \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right) = -q\n$$\nThe total induced charge on the electrode is $-q$. This result is independent of the distance $a$, the permittivity of the medium $\\varepsilon$, and the constant potential $V_{0}$, as anticipated.",

            "problem": "In a constant potential molecular dynamics simulation using the Constant Potential Method (CPM), an atomistic, perfectly conducting electrode is held at a fixed electrical potential relative to a bulk electrolyte reference. The interfacial region is resolved into a compact inner Helmholtz sublayer and a diffuse outer sublayer.

No numerical rounding is required; provide algebraic expressions only.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the potential drops, $\\Delta \\phi_{1}$ and $\\Delta \\phi_{2}$, across two distinct sublayers of an electrochemical interface, which are modeled as capacitors in series. The derivation must start from fundamental principles as specified.\n\nLet $C_{1}$ be the capacitance of the compact inner sublayer and $C_{2}$ be the capacitance of the diffuse outer sublayer. Let $\\Delta \\phi_{1}$ and $\\Delta \\phi_{2}$ be the potential drops across the compact and diffuse sublayers, respectively. The total applied potential difference between the electrode and the bulk electrolyte is $V$.\n\nThe problem provides three core principles to be used in the derivation:\n\n1.  **Definition of Capacitance**: The relationship between the charge $Q$ stored on a capacitor, its capacitance $C$, and the potential difference $\\Delta \\phi$ across it is given by $Q = C \\Delta \\phi$. For our two sublayers, this principle yields two equations:\n    $$Q_{1} = C_{1} \\Delta \\phi_{1} \\quad (1)$$\n    $$Q_{2} = C_{2} \\Delta \\phi_{2} \\quad (2)$$\n    where $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are the magnitudes of the charge separated across the compact and diffuse sublayers, respectively.\n\n2.  **Charge Conservation for Series Connections**: The two sublayers are modeled as capacitors connected in series. In a series connection of capacitors, the magnitude of the charge stored on each capacitor is the same when a voltage is applied across the combination. This is a direct consequence of charge conservation and electrostatic induction in the electrically isolated region between the capacitors. Therefore, we have:\n    $$Q_{1} = Q_{2} = Q \\quad (3)$$\n    where $Q$ is the single value for the magnitude of the charge on the electrode and, correspondingly, separated across each sublayer.\n\n3.  **Summation of Potential Drops**: The total potential drop $V$ across the entire interface is the sum of the individual potential drops across the components connected in series.\n    $$V = \\Delta \\phi_{1} + \\Delta \\phi_{2} \\quad (4)$$\n\nWe now have a system of equations that can be solved for $\\Delta \\phi_{1}$ and $\\Delta \\phi_{2}$.\n\nFirst, we combine equations $(1)$, $(2)$, and $(3)$ to relate the two potential drops:\n$$Q = C_{1} \\Delta \\phi_{1}$$\n$$Q = C_{2} \\Delta \\phi_{2}$$\nEquating these two expressions for $Q$ gives a relationship between $\\Delta \\phi_{1}$ and $\\Delta \\phi_{2}$:\n$$C_{1} \\Delta \\phi_{1} = C_{2} \\Delta \\phi_{2}$$\nFrom this, we can express one potential drop in terms of the other. For example:\n$$\\Delta \\phi_{2} = \\frac{C_{1}}{C_{2}} \\Delta \\phi_{1} \\quad (5)$$\n\nNext, we substitute this relationship into the potential summation equation $(4)$:\n$$V = \\Delta \\phi_{1} + \\left( \\frac{C_{1}}{C_{2}} \\Delta \\phi_{1} \\right)$$\nNow, we can solve for $\\Delta \\phi_{1}$.

The result is identical.\n\nAs a final check, we can sum our derived expressions for $\\Delta \\phi_{1}$ and $\\Delta \\phi_{2}$ to ensure they equal the total applied potential $V$:\n$$\\Delta \\phi_{1} + \\Delta \\phi_{2} = V \\left( \\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1} + C_{2}} \\right) + V \\left( \\frac{C_{1}}{C_{1} + C_{2}} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta \\phi_{1} + \\Delta \\phi_{2} = V \\left( \\frac{C_{2} + C_{1}}{C_{1} + C_{2}} \\right) = V \\cdot 1 = V$$\nThe derivation is consistent. The expressions represent a voltage divider rule for capacitors in series under electrostatic conditions.

It is a standard derivation in computational electrochemistry. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe starting point is the fundamental equation for the internal energy $U$ of an open electrochemical system, which includes the reversible electrical work term $\\Psi dQ$ required to change the charge on the electrode. The first law of thermodynamics for a reversible process is:\n$$dU = TdS - PdV + \\sum_i \\mu_i dN_i + \\Psi dQ$$\nwhere $T$ is temperature, $S$ is entropy, $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $\\mu_i$ are chemical potentials, and $N_i$ are particle numbers.\n\nThe Helmholtz free energy $F$ is defined as $F = U - TS$. Its total differential is:\n$$dF = dU - d(TS) = dU - TdS - SdT$$\nSubstituting the expression for $dU$:\n$$dF = (TdS - PdV + \\sum_i \\mu_i dN_i + \\Psi dQ) - TdS - SdT$$\n$$dF = -SdT - PdV + \\Psi dQ + \\sum_i \\mu_i dN_i$$\nThis is the fundamental differential for the Helmholtz free energy as a function of its natural variables, $F(T,V,Q,\\{N_i\\})$. From this expression, we can identify the electrode potential $\\Psi$ as the partial derivative of $F$ with respect to charge $Q$ at constant $T$, $V$, and $\\{N_i\\}$:\n$$\\Psi = \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Q}\\right)_{T,V,\\{N_i\\}}$$\nThis confirms that $Q$ and $\\Psi$ form a conjugate pair of thermodynamic variables.\n\nThe problem requires moving to an ensemble where the potential $\\Psi$ is the independent variable instead of the charge $Q$. This is accomplished via a Legendre transform. We define a new thermodynamic potential, which we denote $G_{\\Psi}$, as:\n$$G_{\\Psi} = F - \\Psi Q$$\nThe total differential of this new potential is:\n$$dG_{\\Psi} = dF - d(\\Psi Q) = dF - \\Psi dQ - Q d\\Psi$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $dF$:\n$$dG_{\\Psi} = (-SdT - PdV + \\Psi dQ + \\sum_i \\mu_i dN_i) - \\Psi dQ - Q d\\Psi$$\nThe terms involving $\\Psi dQ$ cancel, yielding:\n$$dG_{\\Psi} = -SdT - PdV - Q d\\Psi + \\sum_i \\mu_i dN_i$$\nThis confirms that the natural variables of $G_{\\Psi}$ are $T$, $V$, $\\Psi$, and $\\{N_i\\}$. Thus, $G_{\\Psi}$ is the appropriate thermodynamic potential for a system at constant temperature, volume, and electrode potential.\n\nThe reaction free energy at constant potential, $\\Delta G_{\\Psi}$, is the change in $G_{\\Psi}$ during the reaction from state $1$ to state $2$. The reaction occurs at constant $T$, $V$, $\\{N_i\\}$, and a fixed potential $\\Psi$. Therefore, we can write the change in $G_{\\Psi}$ as:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\Psi} = G_{\\Psi,2} - G_{\\Psi,1}$$\nUsing the definition $G_{\\Psi} = F - \\Psi Q$, we can express this difference in terms of the Helmholtz free energy $F$ and charge $Q$ for the initial and final states:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\Psi} = (F_2 - \\Psi Q_2) - (F_1 - \\Psi Q_1)$$\nSince the potential $\\Psi$ is held constant for the entire process, we can regroup the terms:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\Psi} = (F_2 - F_1) - \\Psi(Q_2 - Q_1)$$\nWe recognize the terms given in the problem statement:\n- The fixed-charge reaction free energy: $\\Delta F_Q = F_2 - F_1$\n- The change in electrode charge: $\\Delta Q = Q_2 - Q_1$\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the equation for $\\Delta G_{\\Psi}$:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\Psi} = \\Delta F_Q - \\Psi \\Delta Q$$\nThe problem asks for the correction term that must be added to $\\Delta F_Q$ to obtain $\\Delta G_{\\Psi}$. If we denote this correction by $C$, we are looking for the value of $C$ in the equation:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\Psi} = \\Delta F_Q + C$$\nBy comparing this with the derived relationship, we can directly identify the correction term:\n$$C = -\\Psi \\Delta Q$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the correction, expressed in terms of the constant potential $\\Psi$ and the change in charge $\\Delta Q$.",
