This exercise introduces scaling analysis, a powerful technique to estimate the characteristic time for diffusion, $t_d$, without solving the full partial differential equation. By applying this method, you can quickly assess whether SEI growth is transport-limited under typical conditions based on its thickness, $L$, and the species diffusivity, $D$. ",

Use physically reasonable boundary conditions in which the outer SEI surface at $x=0$ is held at a fixed solvent number density $c(0,t)=c_{0}$ by the bulk electrolyte, and the inner interface at $x=L$ behaves as a fast reactive sink such that $c(L,t)=0$.

A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Characteristic Diffusion Time**\n\nThe transport of solvent molecules across the SEI is governed by Fick's second law in one dimension:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $c(x,t)$ is the solvent number density at position $x$ and time $t$, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nTo find the characteristic time scale $t_d$ of this process, we perform a scaling analysis. We introduce dimensionless variables by normalizing the physical variables with their characteristic scales. The characteristic length scale is the SEI thickness, $L$. The characteristic concentration scale is the concentration at the outer boundary, $c_0$. The characteristic time scale, $t_d$, is the quantity we aim to determine.\n\nLet the dimensionless variables be:\n- Dimensionless position: $x' = \\frac{x}{L}$\n- Dimensionless concentration: $c' = \\frac{c}{c_0}$\n- Dimensionless time: $t' = \\frac{t}{t_d}$\n\nWe express the partial derivatives in the diffusion equation in terms of these dimensionless variables using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (c_0 c')}{\\partial (t_d t')} = \\frac{c_0}{t_d} \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 (c_0 c')}{\\partial (L x')^2} = \\frac{c_0}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 c'}{\\partial (x')^2}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into Fick's second law:\n$$\n\\frac{c_0}{t_d} \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} = D \\frac{c_0}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 c'}{\\partial (x')^2}\n$$\n\nWe can cancel $c_0$ from both sides and rearrange the equation to group the physical constants:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} = \\left(\\frac{D t_d}{L^2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 c'}{\\partial (x')^2}\n$$\n\nFor this equation to be properly scaled, all dimensionless groups multiplying the derivative terms should be of order unity. This fundamental principle of scaling requires that:\n$$\n\\frac{D t_d}{L^2} \\sim 1\n$$\n\nSolving for the characteristic time scale $t_d$ gives the relationship:\n$$\nt_d = \\frac{L^2}{D}\n$$\nThis expression represents the time it takes for concentration changes to propagate across a distance $L$ via a diffusive process with a diffusion coefficient $D$.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of the Diffusion Time**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- SEI thickness, $L = 50\\ \\text{nm}$\n- Solvent diffusion coefficient, $D = 10^{-20}\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$\n\nFirst, we convert the thickness $L$ to SI units (meters):\n$$\nL = 50\\ \\text{nm} = 50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m} = 5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{m}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the values of $L$ and $D$ into the expression for $t_d$:\n$$\nt_d = \\frac{L^2}{D} = \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{m})^2}{10^{-20}\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\text{m}^2}{10^{-20}\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}}\n$$\n$$\nt_d = 25 \\times 10^{-16 - (-20)}\\ \\text{s} = 25 \\times 10^4\\ \\text{s} = 250000\\ \\text{s}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Expressing this value in scientific notation:\n$$\nt_d = 2.50 \\times 10^5\\ \\text{s}\n$$\n\n**Physical Interpretation and Limiting Regime**\n\nThe growth of the SEI layer is a multi-step process. In the simplified model presented, it involves two key steps in series:\n1.  **Transport:** Solvent molecules diffuse across the existing SEI layer of thickness $L$. The characteristic time for this process is the diffusion time, $t_d$.\n2.  **Reaction:** Solvent molecules react at the inner interface ($x=L$) to form new SEI material. Let the characteristic time for this interfacial reaction be $t_r$.\n\nThe overall rate of SEI growth is determined by the slower of these two sequential steps (the rate-determining step).\n- If $t_d \\gg t_r$, diffusion is the slower process. The reaction is fast and consumes solvent molecules as soon as they arrive at the interface. The growth rate is limited by the flux of solvent supplied by diffusion. This is known as **diffusion-limited growth**.\n- If $t_r \\gg t_d$, the interfacial reaction is the slower process. Diffusion is fast, quickly establishing a concentration profile and supplying an ample amount of solvent to the interface. The growth rate is limited by the slow kinetics of the chemical reaction. This is known as **reaction-limited** or **kinetically-limited growth**.\n\nThe problem states that typical interfacial reaction times, $t_r$, are on the order of seconds to minutes ($1\\ \\text{s} \\lesssim t_r \\lesssim 60\\ \\text{s}$). Our calculated diffusion time is $t_d = 2.50 \\times 10^5\\ \\text{s}$.\n\nComparing these time scales:\n$$\nt_d = 2.50 \\times 10^5\\ \\text{s} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t_r \\approx 1-60\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nClearly, $t_d \\gg t_r$. The time required for solvent molecules to diffuse across the $50\\ \\text{nm}$ SEI is many orders of magnitude longer than the time required for them to react at the interface. Therefore, under these conditions, the growth of the SEI is strongly **diffusion-limited**. The rate at which the SEI thickens is controlled by how fast solvent molecules can traverse the existing layer.",

The growth rate $v_{g}^{(D)}(T)$ is stated to be proportional to the solvent diffusion coefficient $D(T)$. This relationship can be expressed as $v_{g}^{(D)}(T) = C_{D} D(T)$, where $C_D$ is a constant of proportionality.

Consider a single organic solvent species $S$ near the electrode surface and an adsorbed, short-lived radical anion intermediate $I$ formed by electron tunneling through the SEI. The electron tunneling current density $j_e$ is modeled by a one-dimensional barrier with an exponential attenuation. The electron flux is then used to create $I$, which is consumed by three competing chemical pathways producing distinct products $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$, as well as by an unproductive loss channel. All quantities are to be treated as near-surface values.\n\nStart from the following foundational bases:\n- Faraday’s law of electrolysis: the molar electron flux $J_e$ relates to the current density $j_e$ by $J_e = j_e / F$, where $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n- Electron tunneling attenuation: $j_e = j_0 \\exp(-\\alpha L)$, where $j_0$ is the pre-exponential current density, $\\alpha$ is the attenuation coefficient, and $L$ is the SEI thickness.\n- Law of mass action for microkinetic steps in a thin reaction zone of thickness $h$: for a bimolecular step between an intermediate at concentration $c_I$ and a bulk species at concentration $c_X$, the areal consumption flux is $r = h k c_I c_X$, where $k$ is the second-order rate constant. For a unimolecular decay of the intermediate, the areal loss flux is $r_{\\text{loss}} = h k_{\\text{loss}} c_I$.\n- Quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) on the intermediate $I$: the formation flux of $I$ must equal its total consumption flux.\n\nThe elementary steps are:\n- Electron transfer and intermediate formation: $S + e^- \\rightarrow I$. The formation flux of $I$ per unit area is $J_e$ [mol electrons per $\\mathrm{m}^2$ per $\\mathrm{s}$], and each $I$ contains one electron, so the stoichiometric electrons per $I$ is $1$.\n- Competing consumptions:\n    - Path 1: $I + \\text{Li}^+ \\xrightarrow{k_1} P_1$ with rate $r_1 = h k_1 c_I c_{\\text{Li}^+}$.\n    - Path 2: $I + \\text{F}^- \\xrightarrow{k_2} P_2$ with rate $r_2 = h k_2 c_I c_{\\text{F}^-}$.\n    - Path 3: $I + S \\xrightarrow{k_3} P_3$ with rate $r_3 = h k_3 c_I c_S$.\n    - Unproductive loss: $I \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{loss}}} \\varnothing$ with rate $r_{\\text{loss}} = h k_{\\text{loss}} c_I$.\n\nUnder the quasi-steady-state approximation, enforce $J_e = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_{\\text{loss}}$ and derive expressions for the product formation fluxes $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ in terms of $J_e$, $h$, $k_1$, $k_2$, $k_3$, $k_{\\text{loss}}$, $c_S$, $c_{\\text{Li}^+}$, $c_{\\text{F}^-}$, and $F$, as well as the SEI thickness $L$ entering $J_e$ via $j_e$.

For a unimolecular reaction, the areal flux is $r_{\\text{loss}} = h k_{\\text{loss}} c_I$.\n- **Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA)**: The formation flux of the intermediate $I$ equals its total consumption flux.\n- **Reaction Scheme**:\n    - Formation: $S + e^- \\rightarrow I$. The formation flux of $I$ is $J_e$.\n    - Consumption pathways:\n        1. $I + \\text{Li}^+ \\xrightarrow{k_1} P_1$, with rate $r_1 = h k_1 c_I c_{\\text{Li}^+}$.\n        2. $I + \\text{F}^- \\xrightarrow{k_2} P_2$, with rate $r_2 = h k_2 c_I c_{\\text{F}^-}$.\n        3. $I + S \\xrightarrow{k_3} P_3$, with rate $r_3 = h k_3 c_I c_S$.\n        4. $I \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{loss}}} \\varnothing$, with rate $r_{\\text{loss}} = h k_{\\text{loss}} c_I$.\n- **QSSA Enforcement**: $J_e = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_{\\text{loss}}$.\n- **Quantities to Compute**: Product distribution fractions $f_1 = r_1/J_e$, $f_2 = r_2/J_e$, and $f_3 = r_3/J_e$.\n- **Parameters and Test Cases**: Four sets of numerical values for all constants and concentrations are provided, along with their respective units.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of physical chemistry, specifically chemical kinetics (law of mass action, quasi-steady-state approximation) and electrochemistry (Faraday's law, electron tunneling models). The reaction network is a simplified but chemically plausible representation of SEI formation mechanisms. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The application of the QSSA provides a solvable algebraic system that leads to a unique expression for the concentration of the intermediate, and subsequently, for the desired product fractions.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective scientific language. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: All necessary parameters for the calculation are provided in the test suites. The units are consistent (all SI-based). There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-defined exercise in applying fundamental principles of chemical reaction engineering to an electrochemical system. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Solution\n\nThe core of this problem lies in applying the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) to the reactive intermediate, $I$. The QSSA posits that for a highly reactive, short-lived species, its concentration remains approximately constant because its rate of formation is balanced by its rate of consumption.\n\n**1. Application of the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA)**\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the formation flux of the intermediate $I$ is equal to the molar electron flux, $J_e$. The consumption of $I$ occurs through four parallel pathways. The QSSA can be written as:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Formation} = \\text{Rate of Consumption} $$\n$$ J_e = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_{\\text{loss}} $$\nSubstituting the given rate expressions based on the law of mass action:\n$$ J_e = (h k_1 c_I c_{\\text{Li}^+}) + (h k_2 c_I c_{\\text{F}^-}) + (h k_3 c_I c_S) + (h k_{\\text{loss}} c_I) $$\nThe concentration of the intermediate, $c_I$, and the reaction zone thickness, $h$, are common to all terms on the right-hand side. We can factor them out:\n$$ J_e = h c_I (k_1 c_{\\text{Li}^+} + k_2 c_{\\text{F}^-} + k_3 c_S + k_{\\text{loss}}) $$\nThis equation can be solved for the steady-state concentration of the intermediate, $c_I$:\n$$ c_I = \\frac{J_e}{h (k_1 c_{\\text{Li}^+} + k_2 c_{\\text{F}^-} + k_3 c_S + k_{\\text{loss}})} $$\nThe electron flux $J_e$ itself is determined by the electron tunneling model: $J_e = j_e / F = (j_0 \\exp(-\\alpha L)) / F$.\n\n**2. Derivation of Product Distribution Fractions**\n\nThe problem asks for the product distribution fractions, defined as $f_i = r_i / J_e$. These fractions represent the portion of the total electron flux that is channeled into forming each specific product $P_i$.\n\nLet's derive the expression for $f_1$:\n$$ f_1 = \\frac{r_1}{J_e} = \\frac{h k_1 c_I c_{\\text{Li}^+}}{J_e} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $c_I$ derived from the QSSA:\n$$ f_1 = \\frac{h k_1 c_{\\text{Li}^+}}{J_e} \\left( \\frac{J_e}{h (k_1 c_{\\text{Li}^+} + k_2 c_{\\text{F}^-} + k_3 c_S + k_{\\text{loss}})} \\right) $$\nAs can be seen, the terms $J_e$ and $h$ cancel out. This is a crucial insight: the relative fractions are independent of the total flux and the reaction zone thickness. The resulting simplified expression for $f_1$ is:\n$$ f_1 = \\frac{k_1 c_{\\text{Li}^+}}{k_1 c_{\\text{Li}^+} + k_2 c_{\\text{F}^-} + k_3 c_S + k_{\\text{loss}}} $$\nThis result is intuitive. For parallel reactions that are all first-order in the same reactant (here, the intermediate $I$), the fraction of the reactant that follows a particular path is the rate of that path divided by the sum of the rates of all competing paths. Since the concentration of $I$ is common to all rate expressions, it cancels out, leaving a ratio of pseudo-first-order rate constants.\n\nBy the same logic, we can derive the expressions for $f_2$ and $f_3$:\n$$ f_2 = \\frac{r_2}{J_e} = \\frac{k_2 c_{\\text{F}^-}}{k_1 c_{\\text{Li}^+} + k_2 c_{\\text{F}^-} + k_3 c_S + k_{\\text{loss}}} $$\n$$ f_3 = \\frac{r_3}{J_e} = \\frac{k_3 c_S}{k_1 c_{\\text{Li}^+} + k_2 c_{\\text{F}^-} + k_3 c_S + k_{\\text{loss}}} $$\n\nNotice that the parameters related to the electron flux ($j_0$, $\\alpha$, $L$, $F$) and the reaction zone thickness ($h$) do not appear in the final expressions for the fractions. They are essential for determining the absolute rates of product formation ($r_1, r_2, r_3$), but not their relative distribution.\n\n**3. Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nThe calculation for each test case proceeds as follows:\n- For a given set of parameters $\\{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_{\\text{loss}}, c_S, c_{\\text{Li}^+}, c_{\\text{F}^-}\\}$ , first compute the value of each term in the denominator. Let us define these as pseudo-rates, which are the terms that multiply $c_I h$:\n    - $\\rho_1 = k_1 c_{\\text{Li}^+}$\n    - $\\rho_2 = k_2 c_{\\text{F}^-}$\n    - $\\rho_3 = k_3 c_S$\n    - $\\rho_{\\text{loss}} = k_{\\text{loss}}$\n- Compute the sum, which is the denominator $D$: $D = \\rho_1 + \\rho_2 + \\rho_3 + \\rho_{\\text{loss}}$.\n- Calculate each fraction: $f_1 = \\rho_1 / D$, $f_2 = \\rho_2 / D$, and $f_3 = \\rho_3 / D$.\n- Round each fraction to six decimal places as required.\n- Repeat this for all four test cases.\n\nAs an example, for Case $1$:\n- $\\rho_1 = (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 1000.0 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- $\\rho_2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 200.0 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}$\n- $\\rho_3 = (5.0 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times 1000.0 = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}$\n- $\\rho_{\\text{loss}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$\n- $D = 0.002 + 0.0002 + 0.00005 + 0.01 = 0.01225$\n- $f_1 = 0.002 / 0.01225 \\approx 0.1632653$, which rounds to $0.163265$.\n- $f_2 = 0.0002 / 0.01225 \\approx 0.01632653$, which rounds to $0.016327$.\n- $f_3 = 0.00005 / 0.01225 \\approx 0.00408163$, which rounds to $0.004082$.\n\nThis logic will be implemented in the provided Python script.",
