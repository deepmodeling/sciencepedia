The relevant fundamental bases are:\n\n1.  **Electrophoretic drift for species $i$**: The drift velocity magnitude $v_i$ is proportional to the electric field magnitude $E$ via the electrophoretic mobility $\\mu_i$, which is defined as a positive quantity:\n    $$ v_i = \\mu_i E $$\n    Here, $\\mu_i$ has units $\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,V^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$, $E$ has units $\\mathrm{V\\,m^{-1}}$, and $v_i$ has units $\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$, ensuring dimensional consistency.\n\n2.  **Partial Current Density**: The electrical current density $J_i$ due to the flux of species $i$ is the product of its molar concentration $c_i$, its charge per mole $|z_i|F$, and its drift velocity $v_i$.

            "solution": "The derivation of the cation transference number under the Nernst-Einstein (NE) assumption, $t_{+}^{\\mathrm{NE}}$, proceeds from fundamental principles.\n\n(i) The drift of an ion $i$ in an electric field $E$ gives rise to a partial current density $J_i$. The total current density, $J$, is the sum of the partial current densities. The total electrical conductivity, $\\kappa$, is defined by Ohm's law, $J = \\kappa E$.\nThe partial conductivity of an ion $i$, $\\kappa_i$, is given by:\n$$\\kappa_i = |z_i| F c_i \\mu_i$$\nwhere $z_i$ is the charge number, $F$ is Faraday's constant, $c_i$ is the molar concentration, and $\\mu_i$ is the electrical mobility of species $i$.\n\n(iii) The total electrical conductivity is the sum of partial conductivities:\n$$\\kappa = \\sum_i \\kappa_i = |z_+| F c_+ \\mu_+ + |z_-| F c_- \\mu_-$$\n\nThe cation transference number, $t_+$, is the fraction of the total current carried by the cations:\n$$t_+ = \\frac{\\kappa_+}{\\kappa} = \\frac{|z_+| F c_+ \\mu_+}{|z_+| F c_+ \\mu_+ + |z_-| F c_- \\mu_-}$$\n\nFor the specified binary, monovalent electrolyte, we have $z_+ = +1$ and $z_- = -1$, so $|z_+| = |z_-| = 1$. The system is also subject to bulk electroneutrality, which implies $c_+ = c_- = c$. Substituting these conditions into the expression for $t_+$ yields:\n$$t_+ = \\frac{(1) c \\mu_+}{(1) c \\mu_+ + (1) c \\mu_-} = \\frac{\\mu_+}{\\mu_+ + \\mu_-}$$\n\n(ii) The Nernst-Einstein assumption posits an ideal system where ion-ion interactions are negligible. This allows the use of the Einstein relation, which connects the electrical mobility $\\mu_i$ to the self-diffusion coefficient $D_i$:\n$$\\mu_i = \\frac{|z_i| F D_i}{RT}$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. For our system, this gives:\n$$\\mu_+ = \\frac{F D_+}{RT} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu_- = \\frac{F D_-}{RT}$$\nHere, $D_+$ and $D_-$ correspond to the provided self-diffusion coefficients, $D_{\\text{Li}^+}$ and $D_{\\text{TFSI}^-}$, respectively.\n\nSubstituting these expressions for the mobilities into the equation for $t_+$ gives the Nernst-Einstein transference number, $t_{+}^{\\mathrm{NE}}$:\n$$t_{+}^{\\mathrm{NE}} = \\frac{\\frac{F D_+}{RT}}{\\frac{F D_+}{RT} + \\frac{F D_-}{RT}} = \\frac{D_+}{D_+ + D_-}$$\nThis is the desired analytical expression for the NE cation transference number in terms of the ionic self-diffusion coefficients for a symmetric $1:1$ electrolyte.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided data:\n$D_{+} = D_{\\text{Li}^+} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n$D_{-} = D_{\\text{TFSI}^-} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n\n$$t_{+}^{\\mathrm{NE}} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}}{(8.0 \\times 10^{-12} + 2.0 \\times 10^{-12})\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{-12}}{10.0 \\times 10^{-12}} = 0.8$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the result is $0.8000$.\n\nFinally, the qualitative explanation for why the experimentally measured zero-current cation transference number $t_{+}^{0}$ is typically lower than $t_{+}^{\\mathrm{NE}}$ in concentrated polymer electrolytes like PEO–LiTFSI is as follows. The Nernst-Einstein model neglects strong ion-ion correlations, but in reality, cations and anions associate to form neutral ion pairs (e.g., $\\text{Li}^+$-$\\text{TFSI}^-$) and larger, charged aggregates (e.g., negatively charged $[\\text{Li(TFSI)}_2]^-$). Since these neutral or negatively charged lithium-containing species do not contribute positively to the cation flux, the net transport of the lithium component under an electric field is significantly reduced, causing the true transference number $t_{+}^{0}$ to be substantially lower than the ideal $t_{+}^{\\mathrm{NE}}$ value.",

A Haven ratio $H < 1$ indicates that the motions of oppositely charged ions are correlated (e.g., transient ion pairing). Because the ions have opposite charge, this correlation leads to negative cross-correlation terms in the current autocorrelation function, which lowers $\\kappa$ below the independent-particle value.\nC. A Haven ratio $H < 1$ can only occur if at least one self-diffusion coefficient is negative, that is $D_{+} + D_{-} < 0$, because diffusion and conduction must be anticorrelated in sign.\nD.

This indicates that the true conductivity is lower than the value predicted by the independent-particle model. This deviation is due to correlations in the motions of different ions, which are neglected in the Nernst-Einstein model.\n\nIn the Green-Kubo formalism, conductivity is related to the time integral of the total electric current autocorrelation function. This function can be decomposed into self-correlation terms (which sum to the Nernst-Einstein value) and cross-correlation terms. A Haven ratio $H  1$ implies that the cross-correlation terms make a net negative contribution. For a binary electrolyte, the most significant cross-correlation is between oppositely charged ions. In a concentrated solution, coulombic attraction leads to transient ion pairing. When a cation and anion are paired, their velocities are positively correlated, $\\langle \\mathbf{v}_{+}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{-}(t) \\rangle > 0$. However, their contribution to the current autocorrelation function is proportional to $z_{+}z_{-} \\langle \\mathbf{v}_{+}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{-}(t) \\rangle$. Since $z_{+}z_{-}$ is negative, this positive velocity correlation results in a negative contribution to the total conductivity.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\nA. The sum of transference numbers for a simple binary electrolyte is always $t_{+} + t_{-} = 1$ by definition. The premise is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nB. This statement correctly identifies that correlated motion (like ion pairing) is the cause. It correctly states that because the charges are opposite, this correlation leads to negative cross-correlation terms in the current autocorrelation, which lowers the conductivity below the ideal value. This is the physically and mathematically correct explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nC. The self-diffusion coefficient, $D_i$, is proportional to the mean squared displacement and cannot be negative. This statement is unphysical.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. The transference number $t_i$ is a fraction of the total current and must be between 0 and 1 in a simple binary electrolyte. It cannot exceed 1. This premise is unphysical.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
