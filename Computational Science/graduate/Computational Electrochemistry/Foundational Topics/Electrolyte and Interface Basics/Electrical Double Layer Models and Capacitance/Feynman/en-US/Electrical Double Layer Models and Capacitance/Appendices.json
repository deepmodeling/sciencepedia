            "solution": "The problem is to derive and solve the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the electrostatic potential in a semi-infinite symmetric electrolyte adjacent to a charged planar electrode and then to compute the surface charge density on the electrode.\n\nThe analysis begins with the one-dimensional Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential $\\phi(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho(x)$ is the local volumetric charge density in the electrolyte and $\\varepsilon$ is the dielectric permittivity of the medium. The electrolyte is a symmetric $z:z$ binary electrolyte, meaning it consists of cations with charge $+ze$ and anions with charge $-ze$, where $z$ is the valency and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nAt thermal equilibrium, the local number densities of the cations, $n_+(x)$, and anions, $n_-(x)$, are described by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\nn_+(x) = n_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{ze\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nn_-(x) = n_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(-ze)\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right) = n_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $n_{\\infty}$ is the bulk number density of each ionic species (where the potential $\\phi$ is zero), $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe net charge density $\\rho(x)$ is the sum of the charge contributions from the cations and anions:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = (+ze)n_+(x) + (-ze)n_-(x) = ze(n_+(x) - n_-(x))\n$$\nSubstituting the Boltzmann distributions for $n_+(x)$ and $n_-(x)$ yields:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = zen_{\\infty} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{ze\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis can be expressed using the hyperbolic sine function, $\\sinh(u) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\exp(u) - \\exp(-u))$:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = -2zen_{\\infty} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Poisson equation gives the full, non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2} = \\frac{2zen_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the potential is sufficiently small, which corresponds to the condition $|ze\\phi(x)| \\ll k_B T$. This allows for the linearization of the exponential terms or, equivalently, the hyperbolic sine function. For a small argument $u$, $\\sinh(u) \\approx u$.

The characteristic length $1/\\kappa$ is known as the Debye length.\nThe linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation is then written compactly as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2} = \\kappa^2 \\phi(x)\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. Its general solution is:\n$$\n\\phi(x) = C_1 \\exp(\\kappa x) + C_2 \\exp(-\\kappa x)\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants determined by the boundary conditions.\nThe first boundary condition is that the potential vanishes in the bulk electrolyte, far from the electrode: $\\phi(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. Applying this condition:\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left( C_1 \\exp(\\kappa x) + C_2 \\exp(-\\kappa x) \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\kappa > 0$, the term $\\exp(\\kappa x)$ diverges as $x \\to \\infty$. To prevent the potential from becoming infinite, the coefficient $C_1$ must be zero. The term $\\exp(-\\kappa x)$ approaches $0$ as $x \\to \\infty$, which is consistent with the boundary condition. Thus, we must have $C_1=0$.\nThe solution simplifies to:\n$$\n\\phi(x) = C_2 \\exp(-\\kappa x)\n$$\nThe second boundary condition is the fixed potential at the electrode surface: $\\phi(0) = \\phi_0$. Applying this condition:\n$$\n\\phi(0) = C_2 \\exp(-\\kappa \\cdot 0) = C_2 \\cdot 1 = C_2\n$$\nTherefore, $C_2 = \\phi_0$. The final expression for the potential profile is:\n$$\n\\phi(x) = \\phi_0 \\exp(-\\kappa x)\n$$\nNext, we compute the surface charge density $\\sigma$ on the metal electrode. This is related to the electric field at the surface by the Maxwell boundary condition, given in the problem as $\\sigma = -\\varepsilon\\, \\partial_{x}\\phi|_{x=0}$.\nFirst, we find the derivative of the potential $\\phi(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\phi_0 \\exp(-\\kappa x) \\right) = \\phi_0 (-\\kappa) \\exp(-\\kappa x) = -\\kappa \\phi_0 \\exp(-\\kappa x)\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the electrode surface, $x=0$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right|_{x=0} = -\\kappa \\phi_0 \\exp(-\\kappa \\cdot 0) = -\\kappa \\phi_0\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this result into the expression for the surface charge density:\n$$\n\\sigma = -\\varepsilon \\left( -\\kappa \\phi_0 \\right) = \\varepsilon \\kappa \\phi_0\n$$\nThe problem asks for the analytic expressions for $\\phi(x)$ and $\\sigma$. These are the two required results. They describe the exponential decay of the potential away from the electrode and the linear relationship between surface charge and surface potential in the Debye-Hückel approximation.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of physical electrochemistry, well-posed with all necessary parameters provided, and formulated with objective, precise language. It requires the derivation and computation of quantities from the standard Poisson-Boltzmann (Gouy-Chapman) model and a crowding-limited model, which are staples of the field.\n\nThe derivation and computational strategy proceed in three parts:\n1.  Derivation of the surface charge density $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{PB}}$ from the Poisson-Boltzmann model.\n2.  Derivation of the maximum surface charge density $\\sigma_{\\max}$ under steric crowding.\n3.  Implementation of these formulas to compute the required values for the given test cases.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Surface Charge Density $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{PB}}(V)$ (Poisson-Boltzmann Model)\n\nThe starting point is the one-dimensional Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential $\\psi(z)$ as a function of distance $z$ from a planar electrode:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dz^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(z)}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho(z)$ is the local volumetric charge density and $\\epsilon$ is the absolute permittivity of the solvent ($\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}\\epsilon_0$).\n\nFor a symmetric $z:z$ electrolyte, the charge density is given by $\\rho(z) = ze(n_+(z) - n_-(z))$, where $n_+$ and $n_-$ are the number densities of cations and anions, respectively. The Poisson-Boltzmann model assumes ions are point charges whose distribution follows Boltzmann statistics:\n$$\nn_+(z) = n^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{ze\\psi(z)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nn_-(z) = n^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(+\\frac{ze\\psi(z)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $n^{\\infty} = N_{\\mathrm{A}}c^{\\infty}$ is the bulk number density of ions, $e$ is the elementary charge, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\rho(z)$ yields:\n$$\n\\rho(z) = zen^{\\infty}\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{ze\\psi(z)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi(z)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\\right] = -2zen^{\\infty}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi(z)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe Poisson-Boltzmann equation is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dz^2} = \\frac{2zen^{\\infty}}{\\epsilon}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve this equation for the electric field, we multiply by the integrating factor $2(d\\psi/dz)$:\n$$\n2\\frac{d\\psi}{dz}\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dz^2} = \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dz}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4zen^{\\infty}}{\\epsilon}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\\frac{d\\psi}{dz}\n$$\nWe integrate from a point $z$ in the double layer to infinity, applying the bulk boundary conditions $\\psi(\\infty) = 0$ and $(d\\psi/dz)_{z\\to\\infty} = 0$:\n$$\n\\int_z^\\infty \\frac{d}{dz'}\\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dz'}\\right)^2 dz' = \\int_z^\\infty \\frac{4zen^{\\infty}}{\\epsilon}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\\frac{d\\psi}{dz'} dz'\n$$\n$$\n\\left[\\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dz'}\\right)^2\\right]_z^\\infty = \\frac{4zen^{\\infty}}{\\epsilon} \\int_{\\psi(z)}^0 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{zeu}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right) du\n$$\n$$\n0 - \\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dz}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4zen^{\\infty}}{\\epsilon} \\left[\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{ze}\\cosh\\left(\\frac{zeu}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\\right]_{\\psi(z)}^0\n$$\n$$\n-\\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dz}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4n^{\\infty}k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{\\epsilon} \\left(\\cosh(0) - \\cosh\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nUsing the hyperbolic identity $1 - \\cosh(x) = -2\\sinh^2(x/2)$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dz}\\right)^2 = \\frac{8n^{\\infty}k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{\\epsilon}\\sinh^2\\left(\\frac{ze\\psi}{2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe surface charge density on the electrode is defined as $\\sigma = -\\epsilon (d\\psi/dz)\\rvert_{z=0}$. Taking the square root of the above expression (with the appropriate sign to ensure $\\psi$ decays from the surface potential $V$ to $0$) and evaluating at $z=0$ where $\\psi(0)=V$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{PB}}(V) = \\sqrt{8\\epsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}}T n^{\\infty}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{zeV}{2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $n^{\\infty} = N_{\\mathrm{A}} c^{\\infty}$, $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}\\epsilon_0$, and $z=1$ as specified gives the final formula for computation.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of Maximum Surface Charge Density $\\sigma_{\\max}(V)$ (Steric Crowding)\n\nThis model imposes a physical limit on the local number density of ions, $n(z) \\le n_{\\max} = 1/v$, where $v$ is the per-ion excluded volume. This sets an upper bound on the magnitude of the local charge density: $|\\rho(z)| \\le ze n_{\\max}$. Let's define this maximum charge density as $\\rho_{\\max} = ze/v$.\n\nThe surface charge density on the electrode is equal and opposite to the total integrated charge in the diffuse layer:\n$$\n\\sigma = -\\int_0^\\infty \\rho(z) dz\n$$\nTo find the rigorous upper bound on $\\sigma$ for a given positive potential $V > 0$, we must find the charge distribution $\\rho(z)$ that maximizes this integral, subject to the constraints $|\\rho(z)| \\le \\rho_{\\max}$ and that the distribution produces the potential $\\psi(0)=V$. To maximize a positive $\\sigma$, the integral of $\\rho(z)$ must be as negative as possible. This is achieved by setting $\\rho(z)$ to its most negative value, $-\\rho_{\\max}$, over some region starting from the electrode surface. The distribution that maximizes charge for a given potential is a compact layer of counterions:\n$$\n\\rho(z) =\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\rho_{\\max} & \\text{for } 0 \\le z \\le \\delta \\\\\n0 & \\text{for } z > \\delta\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe thickness $\\delta$ of this compact layer is determined by the potential $V$. We solve the Poisson equation for this charge profile: $d^2\\psi/dz^2 = -(-\\rho_{\\max})/\\epsilon = \\rho_{\\max}/\\epsilon$ for $z \\in [0, \\delta]$.\nIntegrating once gives the electric field: $d\\psi/dz = (\\rho_{\\max}/\\epsilon)z + C_1$.\nIntegrating a second time gives the potential: $\\psi(z) = (\\rho_{\\max}/(2\\epsilon))z^2 + C_1z + C_2$.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  $\\psi(0) = V$ (potential at the electrode).\n2.  $\\psi(\\delta) = 0$ (potential is zero at the edge of the compact layer).\n3.  $(d\\psi/dz)\\rvert_{z=\\delta} = 0$ (electric field is zero at the edge of the compact layer, as there is no charge for $z > \\delta$).\n\nFrom condition 1: $C_2 = V$.\nFrom condition 3: $(\\rho_{\\max}/\\epsilon)\\delta + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = -(\\rho_{\\max}/\\epsilon)\\delta$.\nFrom condition 2:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_{\\max}}{2\\epsilon}\\delta^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\max}}{\\epsilon}\\delta\\right)\\delta + V = 0 \\implies -\\frac{\\rho_{\\max}}{2\\epsilon}\\delta^2 + V = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon V}{\\rho_{\\max}}}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the surface charge for this configuration:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max} = -\\int_0^\\delta (-\\rho_{\\max}) dz = \\rho_{\\max}\\delta = \\rho_{\\max}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon V}{\\rho_{\\max}}} = \\sqrt{2\\epsilon V \\rho_{\\max}}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\rho_{\\max} = ze/v$ (with $z=1$) and $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}\\epsilon_0$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max}(V) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}\\epsilon_0eV}{v}}\n$$\nThis expression provides the maximum possible surface charge for a given potential $V$ under the steric constraint.\n\n### Part 3: Computational Implementation\n\nThe derived formulas for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{PB}}(V)$ and $\\sigma_{\\max}(V)$ are implemented in Python. The program computes these values for each test case, along with their ratio $r = \\sigma_{\\max}(V) / \\sigma_{\\mathrm{PB}}(V)$. A custom formatting function ensures that all numerical outputs are rounded to six significant figures in standard decimal notation, as required. For test cases with $V>0$, both $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{PB}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\max}$ are positive. The ratio $r$ provides a dimensionless measure of how steric effects limit the surface charge compared to the ideal point-ion model.",
