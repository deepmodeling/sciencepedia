            "solution": "The user wants to derive the electrostatic energy per unit area stored in a planar capacitor filled with a linear dielectric, starting from fundamental principles.\n\nThe system is defined by two infinite parallel conducting planes. The plane at $z=0$ has a uniform free surface charge density $+\\sigma$, and the plane at $z=d$ has a uniform free surface charge density $-\\sigma$. The region between the planes, $0 < z < d$, is filled with a homogeneous, isotropic, linear dielectric material with permittivity $\\epsilon$. We are operating under electrostatic conditions.\n\nThe fundamental electromagnetic law governing the electric displacement field $\\vec{D}$ is Gauss's law for dielectrics, which in differential form is:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{D} = \\rho_f $$\nwhere $\\rho_f$ is the volume density of free charge. In the region of interest, $0 < z < d$, there are no free charges, so $\\rho_f = 0$.\n\nThe geometry of the problem exhibits planar symmetry. The uniform charge distribution on infinite planes implies that the resulting electric field $\\vec{E}$ and displacement field $\\vec{D}$ must be directed perpendicular to the planes and can only depend on the $z$-coordinate. We can thus write $\\vec{D} = D_z(z)\\hat{k}$, where $\\hat{k}$ is the unit vector in the $+z$ direction.\n\nFor $0 < z < d$, Gauss's law simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dD_z}{dz} = 0 $$\nThis equation implies that $D_z$ must be a constant throughout the region between the plates.\n\nTo determine the value of this constant, we apply Gauss's law in its integral form, $\\oint_S \\vec{D} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = Q_{f, \\text{enc}}$, to a Gaussian surface. We construct a cylindrical pillbox with cross-sectional area $A$. The bottom surface of the pillbox is located within the conducting plane at $z=0$ (where $\\vec{D}=0$ in electrostatics), and the top surface is at an arbitrary position $z$ such that $0 < z < d$. The sides of the pillbox are perpendicular to the plates.\n\nThe flux of $\\vec{D}$ through the side surfaces is zero because $\\vec{D}$ is parallel to these surfaces. The flux through the bottom surface is zero as $\\vec{D}=0$ inside the conductor. The only non-zero contribution to the flux is through the top surface:\n$$ \\oint_S \\vec{D} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\int_{\\text{top}} \\vec{D} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = D_z A $$\nThe total free charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface, $Q_{f, \\text{enc}}$, is the charge on the area $A$ of the plate at $z=0$:\n$$ Q_{f, \\text{enc}} = \\sigma A $$\nApplying Gauss's law:\n$$ D_z A = \\sigma A $$\nThis yields $D_z = \\sigma$. Therefore, the displacement field in the dielectric is uniform and given by:\n$$ \\vec{D} = \\sigma \\hat{k} $$\nThe material is a linear dielectric, so the electric field $\\vec{E}$ is related to the displacement field $\\vec{D}$ by the constitutive relation:\n$$ \\vec{D} = \\epsilon \\vec{E} $$\nSolving for $\\vec{E}$, we obtain:\n$$ \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\vec{D}}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon} \\hat{k} $$\nThe electric field is also uniform throughout the region $0 < z < d$.\n\nThe energy density $u_e$ (energy per unit volume) stored in the electrostatic field within a linear dielectric is given by:\n$$ u_e = \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{E} \\cdot \\vec{D} $$\nSubstituting our expressions for $\\vec{E}$ and $\\vec{D}$:\n$$ u_e = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon}\\hat{k}\\right) \\cdot (\\sigma\\hat{k}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\epsilon} $$\nSince $\\sigma$ and $\\epsilon$ are constants, the energy density $u_e$ is uniform in the space between the plates.\n\nThe total electrostatic energy $U$ stored in a volume $V$ is the integral of the energy density over that volume:\n$$ U = \\int_V u_e \\, dV $$\nTo find the energy per unit area, let's consider a volume defined by an area $A$ on the $xy$-plane and the thickness $d$ in the $z$-direction.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to solve the differential equation for the electrostatic potential $\\phi(z)$. The governing equation in the electrolyte region ($z>0$) is the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2} \\phi}{d z^{2}} = \\kappa^{2} \\phi\n$$\nThis is a homogeneous second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. We assume a solution of the form $\\phi(z) = \\exp(r z)$, which leads to the characteristic equation:\n$$\nr^{2} - \\kappa^{2} = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this equation are $r = \\pm \\kappa$. The general solution for $\\phi(z)$ is therefore a linear combination of the two exponential solutions:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = A \\exp(\\kappa z) + B \\exp(-\\kappa z)\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe first boundary condition is that the potential decays to zero far from the electrode, i.e., $\\phi(z) \\to 0$ as $z \\to \\infty$. Let us examine the two terms in the general solution in this limit. Since $\\kappa$ is a positive constant, the term $A \\exp(\\kappa z)$ diverges as $z \\to \\infty$. For the boundary condition to be satisfied, the coefficient $A$ must be zero. Thus, we must have $A=0$. The solution simplifies to:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = B \\exp(-\\kappa z)\n$$\nThe second boundary condition is that the potential at the electrode surface ($z=0$) is $\\phi_{0}$. Applying this condition:\n$$\n\\phi(0) = B \\exp(-\\kappa \\cdot 0) = B \\exp(0) = B\n$$\nTherefore, $B = \\phi_{0}$.\n\nSubstituting the value of $B$ back, the potential profile for $z \\ge 0$ is:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = \\phi_{0} \\exp(-\\kappa z)\n$$\n\nThe second task is to compute the net diffuse-layer surface charge density, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dl}}$. This is defined as the total charge per unit area in the electrolyte, integrated from the surface outwards to infinity:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dl}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho(z) \\, dz\n$$\nwhere $\\rho(z)$ is the volume charge density in the electrolyte. The charge density $\\rho(z)$ is related to the potential $\\phi(z)$ by Poisson's equation. For a one-dimensional system in a medium of permittivity $\\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0}$, this relationship is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2} \\phi}{d z^{2}} = -\\frac{\\rho(z)}{\\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0}}\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the charge density as:\n$$\n\\rho(z) = -\\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0} \\frac{d^{2} \\phi}{d z^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\rho(z)$ into the integral for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dl}}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dl}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0} \\frac{d^{2} \\phi}{d z^{2}}\\right) \\, dz = -\\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{d^{2} \\phi}{d z^{2}} \\, dz\n$$\nBy the fundamental theorem of calculus, the integral of a second derivative is the first derivative evaluated at the boundaries:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dl}} = -\\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0} \\left[ \\frac{d\\phi}{dz} \\right]_{z=0}^{z \\to \\infty} = -\\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0} \\left( \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} \\frac{d\\phi}{dz} - \\left. \\frac{d\\phi}{dz} \\right|_{z=0} \\right)\n$$\nWe need to calculate the first derivative of the potential profile, $\\phi(z) = \\phi_{0} \\exp(-\\kappa z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dz} = \\frac{d}{dz} \\left( \\phi_{0} \\exp(-\\kappa z) \\right) = -\\kappa \\phi_{0} \\exp(-\\kappa z)\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the integration limits:\n1.  As $z \\to \\infty$, since $\\kappa > 0$, the term $\\exp(-\\kappa z)$ approaches $0$. Therefore, $\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} \\frac{d\\phi}{dz} = 0$.\n2.  At $z=0$, the derivative is $\\left. \\frac{d\\phi}{dz} \\right|_{z=0} = -\\kappa \\phi_{0} \\exp(-\\kappa \\cdot 0) = -\\kappa \\phi_{0}$.\n\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dl}}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dl}} = -\\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0} \\left( 0 - (-\\kappa \\phi_{0}) \\right) = -\\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0} (\\kappa \\phi_{0})\n$$\nThus, the final expression for the diffuse-layer surface charge density is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dl}} = -\\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0} \\kappa \\phi_{0}\n$$\nThis result is also consistent with the principle of overall charge neutrality. The charge on the metal surface, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{m}}$, must be equal and opposite to the total charge in the diffuse layer, i.e., $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{m}} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{dl}} = 0$. The surface charge on the metal is related to the electric field in the dielectric at the interface by Gauss's law, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0} E_{z}(0^{+})$. The electric field is $E_{z} = -d\\phi/dz$, so $E_{z}(0^{+}) = -(-\\kappa\\phi_{0}) = \\kappa\\phi_{0}$. This gives $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0} \\kappa \\phi_{0}$, which confirms that $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dl}} = -\\sigma_{\\mathrm{m}} = -\\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0} \\kappa \\phi_{0}$.",

By taking the reciprocal:\n$$ \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{int}}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{S} + \\epsilon_{b} \\kappa d_{S}}{\\epsilon_{S} \\epsilon_{b} \\kappa} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{S}}{\\epsilon_{S} \\epsilon_{b} \\kappa} + \\frac{\\epsilon_{b} \\kappa d_{S}}{\\epsilon_{S} \\epsilon_{b} \\kappa} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{b} \\kappa} + \\frac{d_{S}}{\\epsilon_{S}} $$\nThis shows that the total interfacial capacitance is equivalent to two capacitors connected in series: the Stern layer capacitance, $C_{S} = \\epsilon_{S}/d_{S}$, and the diffuse layer (Gouy-Chapman) capacitance in the linear regime, $C_{D} = \\epsilon_{b}\\kappa$.\n\nThe problem asks for a single closed-form symbolic expression for $C_{\\mathrm{int}}$. The form derived first is most appropriate.",
