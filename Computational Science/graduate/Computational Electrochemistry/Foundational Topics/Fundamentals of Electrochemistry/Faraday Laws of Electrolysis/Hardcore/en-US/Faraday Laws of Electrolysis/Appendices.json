By considering two different electrochemical cells connected in series, we can directly explore the implications of Faraday's second law, which states that the mass of different substances liberated by the same quantity of electricity is proportional to their chemical equivalent weights. This practice  is essential for confirming a robust understanding of the direct link between charge, moles, and stoichiometry before tackling more complex scenarios involving inefficiencies and noise.",

The computational goal is to design and implement an algorithm that estimates the total charge $Q$ passed and its uncertainty bounds, and then propagates this uncertainty to the deposited mass $m$ via Faraday's laws of electrolysis. Your algorithm must start from fundamental definitions and assumptions without relying on pre-derived shortcut formulas.\n\nFundamental bases to use:\n- Electric charge is the time integral of current, so $Q$ is the time integral of $I(t)$ over the measurement window.\n- Faraday's laws of electrolysis state that the amount of substance transformed is proportional to the total charge, with proportionality determined by stoichiometry and the Faraday constant.\n- Standard uncertainty propagation for independent random variables may be used, grounded in linearization (first-order Taylor expansion) about mean values.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The instrument reports a baseline current offset parameter $b$ (in amperes) with mean $b_{\\mu}$ and standard uncertainty $b_{\\sigma}$, which is subtracted from each point to form baseline-corrected currents.\n- The measured currents at each time point have independent, zero-mean measurement errors with known standard uncertainties $s_i$ (in amperes).\n- The baseline offset $b$ is independent of all per-point measurement errors, but it is common to all points, implying that it induces correlations among the baseline-corrected current samples.\n- The Faradaic efficiency $\\phi$ is an independent scalar with mean $\\phi_{\\mu}$ and standard uncertainty $\\phi_{\\sigma}$.\n- Time stamps $t_i$ are known exactly and strictly increase, and numerical integration must respect the sampling.\n\nRequired algorithmic outputs for each test case:\n- Compute the mean total charge $Q$ in coulombs.\n- Compute a two-sided coverage interval for $Q$ under a Normal approximation at coverage probability $0.95$ using coverage factor $k = 1.96$, reported as lower and upper bounds.\n- Compute the mean deposited mass $m$ in grams using Faraday's law, with stoichiometric electron number $n$, molar mass $M$ (in grams per mole), and the Faraday constant $F$ (in coulombs per mole).\n- Propagate uncertainties from current measurements and baseline to $Q$, and from $Q$ and $\\phi$ to $m$ using first-order linearization.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the design of an algorithm to compute the total charge $Q$ and deposited mass $m$ from a discrete set of chronoamperometric data, including the propagation of all specified uncertainties. The solution is developed step-by-step, starting from fundamental principles as required.\n\nLet the discrete time points be $t_i$ and the corresponding measured currents be $I_i$, for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$. Each current measurement $I_i$ has an associated independent, zero-mean measurement error with a known standard uncertainty $s_i$. A common baseline offset current $b$, with mean $b_{\\mu}$ and standard uncertainty $b_{\\sigma}$, is subtracted from all measurements. This offset $b$ is independent of the per-point measurement errors.\n\nThe baseline-corrected current at time $t_i$ is $J_i = I_i - b$. Since we only have one set of measurements $\\{I_i\\}$, these are our best estimates for the true mean currents at each time point. The best estimate for the baseline-corrected current is therefore $J_{\\mu,i} = I_i - b_{\\mu}$.\n\n**Part 1: Mean Total Charge $Q_{\\mu}$**\n\nThe total charge $Q$ is the time integral of the current. For discrete data points, this integral must be approximated numerically. The problem specifies the use of the trapezoidal rule, which is appropriate for potentially unevenly spaced time points. The mean total charge $Q_{\\mu}$ is the integral of the mean baseline-corrected current, $J_{\\mu}(t)$:\n$$ Q_{\\mu} = \\int_{t_0}^{t_{N-1}} J_{\\mu}(t) dt \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \\frac{J_{\\mu,i} + J_{\\mu,i+1}}{2} (t_{i+1} - t_i) $$\nwhere $J_{\\mu,i} = I_i - b_{\\mu}$. This can be computed efficiently using standard numerical libraries.\n\n**Part 2: Uncertainty of the Total Charge $\\sigma_Q$**\n\nTo determine the uncertainty in $Q$, we must propagate the uncertainties from the input random variables. The sources of uncertainty are the individual current measurements, represented by their standard uncertainties $s_i$, and the baseline offset, represented by its standard uncertainty $b_{\\sigma}$. All these error sources are assumed to be independent.\n\nThe total charge $Q$ is a function of the random variables $\\{I_i\\}$ and $b$. Using the trapezoidal rule on the baseline-corrected currents $J_i = I_i - b$:\n$$ Q = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \\frac{(I_i - b) + (I_{i+1} - b)}{2} (t_{i+1} - t_i) $$\nThis expression can be rearranged to separate the contributions from $\\{I_i\\}$ and $b$:\n$$ Q = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \\frac{I_i + I_{i+1}}{2} (t_{i+1} - t_i) - b \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} (t_{i+1} - t_i) $$\n$$ Q = \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i I_i \\right) - b(t_{N-1} - t_0) $$\nwhere $w_i$ are the weights for each current point $I_i$ from the trapezoidal rule:\n$$ w_i = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{2}(t_1 - t_0)  i=0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}((t_{i} - t_{i-1}) + (t_{i+1} - t_i))  0  i  N-1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}(t_{N-1} - t_{N-2})  i=N-1 \\end{cases} $$\nThe total charge $Q$ is a linear combination of the independent random variables $I_0, \\dots, I_{N-1}, b$. The variance of such a combination, $\\text{Var}(Q)$, is given by the sum of the squared partial derivatives with respect to each variable, multiplied by the variance of that variable.\n$$ \\sigma_Q^2 = \\text{Var}(Q) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial I_i}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(I_i) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial b}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(b) $$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial I_i} = w_i $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial b} = -(t_{N-1} - t_0) $$\nThe variances are given as $\\text{Var}(I_i) = s_i^2$ and $\\text{Var}(b) = b_{\\sigma}^2$. Substituting these yields the formula for the variance of the total charge:\n$$ \\sigma_Q^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i^2 s_i^2 + (t_{N-1} - t_0)^2 b_{\\sigma}^2 $$\nThe standard uncertainty $\\sigma_Q$ is the square root of this variance. The first term accounts for the independent per-point measurement errors, while the second term accounts for the systematic error introduced by the common baseline offset.\n\n**Part 3: Coverage Interval for $Q$**\n\nAssuming the distribution of $Q$ can be approximated by a Normal distribution (justified by the Central Limit Theorem as $Q$ is a sum of many random variables), a two-sided coverage interval with probability $p$ can be constructed. For the specified $p=0.95$, the coverage factor is $k=1.96$. The lower and upper bounds of the interval are:\n$$ Q_{\\text{lower}} = Q_{\\mu} - k \\sigma_Q $$\n$$ Q_{\\text{upper}} = Q_{\\mu} + k \\sigma_Q $$\n\n**Part 4: Mean Deposited Mass $m_{\\mu}$**\n\nFaraday's laws of electrolysis relate the deposited mass $m$ to the total charge passed. The effective charge for the reaction, or Faradaic charge, is $Q_{\\text{Faraday}} = Q \\cdot \\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the Faradaic efficiency. The mass is given by:\n$$ m = \\frac{Q_{\\text{Faraday}} M}{n F} = \\frac{Q \\phi M}{n F} $$\nwhere $M$ is the molar mass of the substance, $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred per mole of substance (stoichiometric number), and $F$ is the Faraday constant. The mean mass $m_{\\mu}$ is found by substituting the mean values of $Q$ and $\\phi$, as they are independent variables:\n$$ m_{\\mu} \\approx m(Q_{\\mu}, \\phi_{\\mu}) = \\frac{Q_{\\mu} \\phi_{\\mu} M}{n F} $$\n\n**Part 5: Uncertainty of the Deposited Mass $\\sigma_m$**\n\nThe uncertainty in mass, $\\sigma_m$, is determined by propagating the uncertainties from $Q$ and $\\phi$. The problem states these can be treated as independent variables. Using first-order linearization, the variance of $m$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_m^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial Q}\\right)^2 \\sigma_Q^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\phi}^2 $$\nThe partial derivatives, evaluated at the mean values, are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial Q} \\Bigg|_{Q_{\\mu}, \\phi_{\\mu}} = \\frac{\\phi_{\\mu} M}{n F} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial \\phi} \\Bigg|_{Q_{\\mu}, \\phi_{\\mu}} = \\frac{Q_{\\mu} M}{n F} $$\nSubstituting these yields the variance for the mass:\n$$ \\sigma_m^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\phi_{\\mu} M}{n F}\\right)^2 \\sigma_Q^2 + \\left(\\frac{Q_{\\mu} M}{n F}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\phi}^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_m = \\frac{M}{nF} \\sqrt{(\\phi_{\\mu} \\sigma_Q)^2 + (Q_{\\mu} \\sigma_{\\phi})^2} $$\nThe standard uncertainty $\\sigma_m$ is the square root of this variance.\n\n**Part 6: Coverage Interval for $m$**\n\nSimilar to the charge, a $0.95$ coverage interval for the mass $m$ is constructed using the coverage factor $k=1.96$:\n$$ m_{\\text{lower}} = m_{\\mu} - k \\sigma_m $$\n$$ m_{\\text{upper}} = m_{\\mu} + k \\sigma_m $$\n\n**Part 7: Output Formatting**\n\nAll final numerical results ($Q_{\\mu}, Q_{\\text{lower}}, Q_{\\text{upper}}, m_{\\mu}, m_{\\text{lower}}, m_{\\text{upper}}$) must be formatted to six significant figures, which requires careful handling of numerical-to-string conversion to preserve trailing zeros. This algorithmic procedure is then applied to each test case.",
