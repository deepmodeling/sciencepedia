The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe starting point is the steady-state $x$-momentum equation for a one-dimensional shear flow, $u=u(y)$, with constant density and no pressure gradient. For fully developed flow, the convective acceleration terms are zero. The momentum equation reduces to a balance between viscous forces:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\tau_{xy}\\right) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{xy}$ is the shear stress. This equation implies that the shear stress is constant across the gap:\n$$\n\\tau_{xy}(y) = \\text{constant} = C_{1}\n$$\nThis constant shear stress is equal to the stress at the wall, so we can set $C_{1} = \\tau_{w}$, where $\\tau_{w} = \\tau_{xy}(y=0)$.\n\nNewton's law of viscosity states:\n$$\n\\tau_{xy} = \\mu(y) \\frac{du}{dy}\n$$\nCombining these, we get:\n$$\n\\mu(y) \\frac{du}{dy} = \\tau_{w}\n$$\nThe viscosity $\\mu$ is a function of temperature $T$, and temperature is a function of position $y$. We first express $\\mu$ as an explicit function of $y$:\n$$\nT(y) = T_{0} + \\Delta T \\frac{y}{h} = T_{0} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}} \\frac{y}{h}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the viscosity law:\n$$\n\\mu(y) = \\mu_{0}\\left(\\frac{T(y)}{T_{0}}\\right)^{n} = \\mu_{0}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}} \\frac{y}{h}\\right)^{n}\n$$\nNow, we can write the differential equation for the velocity profile $u(y)$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{\\tau_{w}}{\\mu(y)} = \\frac{\\tau_{w}}{\\mu_{0}}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}} \\frac{y}{h}\\right)^{-n}\n$$\nTo find the velocity profile $u(y)$, we integrate this expression with respect to $y$:\n$$\nu(y) = \\int \\frac{\\tau_{w}}{\\mu_{0}}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}} \\frac{y}{h}\\right)^{-n} dy\n$$\nLet the variable of integration be $z = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}} \\frac{y}{h}$. Then $dz = \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}h} dy$, so $dy = \\frac{T_{0}h}{\\Delta T} dz$.\nThe integration yields:\n$$\nu(y) = \\frac{\\tau_{w}}{\\mu_{0}} \\int z^{-n} \\left(\\frac{T_{0}h}{\\Delta T}\\right) dz = \\frac{\\tau_{w}T_{0}h}{\\mu_{0}\\Delta T} \\frac{z^{1-n}}{1-n} + C_{2}\n$$\nThis integration is valid because the problem specifies $n \\neq 1$.

The request to express the answer in Pascals (Pa) is a confirmation of the physical quantity, as the derived expression is dimensionally consistent with stress (Force/Area) if SI units are used for all input parameters.\n\nFinally, we verify the result in the limit $n \\to 0$. This limit corresponds to a constant viscosity $\\mu = \\mu_0$.\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to 0} \\tau_{w} = \\lim_{n\\to 0} \\frac{\\mu_{0} U (1-n) \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}}{h \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{1-n} - 1 \\right]} = \\frac{\\mu_{0} U (1) \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}}{h \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{1} - 1 \\right]}\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to 0} \\tau_{w} = \\frac{\\mu_{0} U \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}}{h \\left( \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}} \\right)} = \\frac{\\mu_{0} U}{h}\n$$\nThis is precisely the well-known shear stress for classical planar Couette flow with constant viscosity $\\mu_{0}$, thus verifying the derived expression.\nThe velocity profile $u(y)$ can also be expressed by substituting $\\tau_w$ into its equation:\n$$\nu(y) = U \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}\\frac{y}{h}\\right)^{1-n} - 1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{1-n} - 1}\n$$\nThis expression satisfies $u(0)=0$ and $u(h)=U$, as required.

For the axial component, denoted $x$, with velocity $u_x$ (using $u_x$ instead of $v_x$ for clarity), the equation reduces to a balance between pressure and viscous forces:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x} + \\mu \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}r} \\left( r \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u_x}{\\mathrm{d}r} \\right)\n$$\nSince $u_x$ depends only on $r$ and $p$ depends only on $x$, we use total derivatives.

The mean free path is given by $\\lambda \\sim 1/\\!\\left(n \\, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{mt}}(\\bar{g})\\right)$, where $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{mt}}(\\bar{g})$ is the momentum-transfer cross section evaluated at a characteristic relative speed $\\bar{g}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the one for $\\mu$:\n\n$$\n\\mu \\sim m n (\\bar{c} \\, \\lambda) \\sim m n \\left(\\bar{c} \\frac{1}{n \\, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{mt}}(\\bar{g})}\\right) = \\frac{m \\bar{c}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{mt}}(\\bar{g})}\n$$\n\nNow, we must find the temperature scaling of each term. The mass $m$ is a constant and can be ignored for scaling purposes. The problem provides the temperature scalings for the characteristic speeds:\n$\\bar{c} \\sim \\sqrt{k_{B} T / m} \\propto T^{1/2}$\n$\\bar{g} \\sim \\sqrt{k_{B} T / m_{r}} \\propto T^{1/2}$\n\nUsing the result from Step 1, we can find the temperature scaling of the cross section by substituting the scaling for $\\bar{g}$:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{mt}}(\\bar{g}) \\propto (\\bar{g})^{-4/\\nu} \\propto (T^{1/2})^{-4/\\nu} = T^{-2/\\nu}\n$$\n\nNow substitute the temperature scalings for $\\bar{c}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{mt}}(\\bar{g})$ back into the expression for $\\mu$:\n\n$$\n\\mu \\propto \\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{mt}}(\\bar{g})} \\propto \\frac{T^{1/2}}{T^{-2/\\nu}} = T^{1/2 - (-2/\\nu)} = T^{1/2 + 2/\\nu}\n$$\n\nBy comparing this with the given form $\\mu \\propto T^{s(\\nu)}$, we identify the scaling exponent $s(\\nu)$ as:\n\n$$\ns(\\nu) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{\\nu}\n$$\n\nStep 3: Apply the result to the two specified cases and compute the difference $\\Delta s$.\n\nCase (a): Hard-sphere gas (HS).\nThis model is recovered in the limit of an infinitely steep repulsive potential, i.e., $\\nu \\to \\infty$.\n\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{HS}} = \\lim_{\\nu \\to \\infty} s(\\nu) = \\lim_{\\nu \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{\\nu}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + 0 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nCase (b): Lennard-Jones (LJ) repulsive branch.\nThis is modeled with an effective repulsive exponent of $\\nu = 12$.\n\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{LJ}} = s(12) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\n\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{LJ}} = \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta s = s_{\\mathrm{LJ}} - s_{\\mathrm{HS}}$.\n\n$$\n\\Delta s = \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nUsing the common denominator of $6$:\n\n$$\n\\Delta s = \\frac{4}{6} - \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\n\nThis is the required difference between the two temperature-scaling exponents.",
