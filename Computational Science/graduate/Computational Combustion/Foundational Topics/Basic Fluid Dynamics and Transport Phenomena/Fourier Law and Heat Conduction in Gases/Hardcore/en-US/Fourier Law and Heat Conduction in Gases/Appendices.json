            "problem": "A dilute, single-component gas occupies a stationary planar layer between two infinite parallel isothermal walls at positions $x=0$ and $x=L$. The wall at $x=0$ is maintained at temperature $T_{0}$ and the wall at $x=L$ at temperature $T_{L}$. The gas is at rest (no bulk flow), there is no volumetric heat release, and radiation is negligible. Mean free path effects are negligible compared to $L$ (continuum limit), and the system has reached steady state. This setting is representative of a conduction-controlled subproblem encountered in computational combustion when isolating the thermal diffusion contribution to the energy equation in a gas mixture. \n\n(a) Starting from steady one-dimensional energy conservation (no volumetric sources) and a constitutive relation consistent with linear irreversible thermodynamics for a dilute gas in the hydrodynamic limit, derive the expressions for the spatial temperature field $T(x)$ and the uniform conductive heat flux $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ for the case of constant thermal conductivity $k=k_{0}$, subject to the boundary conditions $T(0)=T_{0}$ and $T(L)=T_{L}$. Express your final formulas in closed form in terms of $T_{0}$, $T_{L}$, $L$, and $k_{0}$.\n\n(b) Now suppose the thermal conductivity varies with temperature according to a power law $k(T)=k_{0}\\left(T/T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)^{n}$, where $k_{0}0$, $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}0$, and $n$ is a real constant.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We may proceed with a solution.\n\nThe fundamental physical principle governing this problem is the conservation of energy. For a one-dimensional, steady-state system with no bulk flow and no volumetric heat sources, the energy equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d q^{\\prime\\prime}}{dx} = 0 $$\nwhere $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ is the conductive heat flux in the $x$-direction. This equation implies that the heat flux $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ must be constant throughout the gas layer, from $x=0$ to $x=L$.\n\nThe constitutive relation connecting heat flux to the temperature gradient is Fourier's law of heat conduction, which in one dimension is given by:\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime} = -k \\frac{dT}{dx} $$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the gas and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nWe now address the two parts of the problem.\n\n(a) Case of constant thermal conductivity, $k=k_0$.\n\nWith constant thermal conductivity $k_0$, and knowing that $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ is constant, Fourier's law becomes an ordinary differential equation with a constant right-hand side:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime}}{k_0} $$\nWe can integrate this equation with respect to $x$ from the boundary at $x=0$ to an arbitrary position $x$ within the layer:\n$$ \\int_{T(0)}^{T(x)} dT' = \\int_{0}^{x} \\left(-\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime}}{k_0}\\right) dx' $$\nUsing the boundary condition $T(0)=T_0$, the integration yields the temperature profile as a function of $x$ and the unknown constant heat flux $q^{\\prime\\prime}$:\n$$ T(x) - T_0 = -\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime}}{k_0} x $$\n$$ T(x) = T_0 - \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime}}{k_0} x $$\nThis shows that the temperature profile is linear for constant thermal conductivity.\n\nTo determine the heat flux $q^{\\prime\\prime}$, we apply the second boundary condition at $x=L$, where $T(L)=T_L$:\n$$ T_L = T_0 - \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime}}{k_0} L $$\nSolving for $q^{\\prime\\prime}$:\n$$ \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime}}{k_0} L = T_0 - T_L $$\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime} = \\frac{k_0(T_0 - T_L)}{L} $$\nThis is the expression for the constant conductive heat flux. A positive $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ corresponds to heat flow from the hot wall to the cold wall, which occurs if $T_0  T_L$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ back into the equation for $T(x)$ to obtain the temperature profile solely in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ T(x) = T_0 - \\frac{1}{k_0} \\left( \\frac{k_0(T_0 - T_L)}{L} \\right) x $$\n$$ T(x) = T_0 - (T_0 - T_L) \\frac{x}{L} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged into a more symmetric form:\n$$ T(x) = T_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{L}\\right) + T_L \\frac{x}{L} $$\n\n(b) Case of temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, $k(T)=k_{0}\\left(T/T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)^{n}$.\n\nThe governing equations remain the same: $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ is constant, and Fourier's law is $q^{\\prime\\prime} = -k(T) \\frac{dT}{dx}$. Substituting the given form for $k(T)$:\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime} = -k_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^n \\frac{dT}{dx} $$\nTo find the constant heat flux $q^{\\prime\\prime}$, we separate variables and integrate across the entire domain.\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime} dx = -k_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^n dT $$\nIntegrating the left side from $x=0$ to $x=L$ and the right side from the corresponding temperatures $T=T_0$ to $T=T_L$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} q^{\\prime\\prime} dx = \\int_{T_0}^{T_L} -k_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^n dT $$\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime} [x]_0^L = -\\frac{k_0}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}^n} \\int_{T_0}^{T_L} T^n dT $$\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime} L = -\\frac{k_0}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}^n} \\int_{T_0}^{T_L} T^n dT $$\nThe integral depends on the value of $n$. For the general case where $n \\neq -1$:\n$$ \\int_{T_0}^{T_L} T^n dT = \\left[ \\frac{T^{n+1}}{n+1} \\right]_{T_0}^{T_L} = \\frac{T_L^{n+1} - T_0^{n+1}}{n+1} $$\nSubstituting this result back:\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime} L = -\\frac{k_0}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}^n} \\left( \\frac{T_L^{n+1} - T_0^{n+1}}{n+1} \\right) $$\nSolving for $q^{\\prime\\prime}$:\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime} = \\frac{k_0}{(n+1) L T_{\\mathrm{ref}}^n} (T_0^{n+1} - T_L^{n+1}) $$\nFor the special case $n = -1$:\n$$ \\int_{T_0}^{T_L} T^{-1} dT = [\\ln(T)]_{T_0}^{T_L} = \\ln(T_L) - \\ln(T_0) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_L}{T_0}\\right) $$\nAnd the heat flux becomes:\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime} L = -k_0 T_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_L}{T_0}\\right) \\implies q^{\\prime\\prime} = \\frac{k_0 T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_0}{T_L}\\right) $$\n\nNext, we discuss the shape of the temperature profile $T(x)$. The curvature of the profile is given by the second derivative, $\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2}$. We start with Fourier's law, $q^{\\prime\\prime} = -k(T) \\frac{dT}{dx}$, and differentiate with respect to $x$, remembering that $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ is constant:\n$$ \\frac{d q^{\\prime\\prime}}{dx} = 0 = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-k(T(x)) \\frac{dT}{dx}\\right) = - \\left[ \\frac{dk}{dT} \\left(\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right)^2 + k(T) \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} \\right] $$\nSolving for the second derivative:\n$$ \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = -\\frac{1}{k(T)} \\frac{dk}{dT} \\left(\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right)^2 $$\nFor $k(T) = k_0 (T/T_{\\mathrm{ref}})^n$, we have $\\frac{dk}{dT} = n k_0 T_{\\mathrm{ref}}^{-n} T^{n-1} = n \\frac{k(T)}{T}$. Substituting this into the expression for the curvature:\n$$ \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = -\\frac{1}{k(T)} \\left(n \\frac{k(T)}{T}\\right) \\left(\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{n}{T} \\left(\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right)^2 $$\nSince temperature $T$ must be positive (absolute scale) and $\\left(\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right)^2 \\ge 0$, the sign of the curvature is determined entirely by the sign of $-n$.\n\nCase $n  0$: The curvature $\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2}$ is negative. This means the temperature profile $T(x)$ is concave down.\nPhysical interpretation: If $n  0$, the thermal conductivity $k(T)$ increases with temperature. The gas is more conductive at higher temperatures and less conductive at lower temperatures. A constant heat flux $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ must be maintained across the layer. From $|dT/dx| = |q^{\\prime\\prime}|/k(T)$, a smaller conductivity requires a larger temperature gradient magnitude. Therefore, the temperature gradient will be steepest in the colder regions and gentlest in the hotter regions. The profile bends away from the linear profile towards the colder boundary temperature. In combustion, gases often exhibit $k(T)$ increasing with $T$ (e.g., simple kinetic theory suggests $n \\approx 1/2$), so this concave-down profile is typical.\n\nCase $n  0$: The curvature $\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2}$ is positive. This means the temperature profile $T(x)$ is concave up.\nPhysical interpretation: If $n  0$, the thermal conductivity $k(T)$ decreases with increasing temperature. The gas is less conductive at higher temperatures. To maintain constant $q^{\\prime\\prime}$, the temperature gradient magnitude $|dT/dx|$ must now be larger in the hotter regions. The profile bends away from the linear profile towards the hotter boundary temperature.\n\nCase $n = 0$: The curvature $\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2}$ is zero. The temperature profile is linear, recovering the result from part (a).",

            "solution": "This problem is addressed in two parts. The first part requires a derivation of the general form of the heat conduction law in an anisotropic medium from the principles of Linear Irreversible Thermodynamics (LIT). The second part applies this law to find the shape of isotherms around a line heat source.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Constitutive Relation for Heat Flux**\n\nThe analysis begins with the second law of thermodynamics, which states that for any irreversible process, the local rate of entropy production, $\\sigma_s$, must be non-negative. For heat conduction in a stationary medium with no species gradients or external forces, the entropy production rate is given by the product of the heat flux vector, $\\mathbf{q}$, and the gradient of the inverse temperature, $1/T$.\n$$\n\\sigma_s = \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\nabla \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right) \\ge 0\n$$\nIn the framework of LIT, the entropy production is expressed as a sum of products of conjugate thermodynamic fluxes $\\mathbf{J}_i$ and forces $\\mathbf{X}_i$, such that $\\sigma_s = \\sum_i \\mathbf{J}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i$. For the present case of pure heat conduction, we can identify the flux as the heat flux vector itself, $\\mathbf{J}_q = \\mathbf{q}$, and the conjugate thermodynamic force as $\\mathbf{X}_q = \\nabla(1/T)$.\n\nThe force term can be expanded using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\mathbf{X}_q = \\nabla \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{T^2} \\nabla T\n$$\nThus, the entropy production rate becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_s = -\\frac{1}{T^2} (\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\nabla T) \\ge 0\n$$\nLIT postulates a linear relationship between the fluxes and forces for systems near thermodynamic equilibrium. For this system, the relationship is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_q = \\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_q \\quad \\implies \\quad \\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\nabla \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{L}$ is a second-order tensor of phenomenological coefficients. Curie's principle, which forbids coupling between fluxes and forces of different tensorial character in isotropic systems, is consistent with this form since both $\\mathbf{q}$ and $\\nabla(1/T)$ are vectors (first-order tensors) and can be coupled by a second-order tensor $\\mathbf{L}$. In an anisotropic medium, this form is general.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the force, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{T^2} \\nabla T\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{L}}{T^2}\\right) \\nabla T\n$$\nWe define the thermal conductivity tensor, $\\mathbf{K}$, as $\\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{L}/T^2$. The constitutive relation, known as Fourier's generalized law of heat conduction, is then:\n$$\n\\mathbf{q} = -\\mathbf{K} \\nabla T\n$$\nNow we examine the properties of $\\mathbf{K}$.\n$1$. **Positive Definiteness**: Substitute the constitutive relation back into the entropy production expression:\n$$\n\\sigma_s = (-\\mathbf{K} \\nabla T) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{T^2} \\nabla T\\right) = \\frac{1}{T^2} (\\nabla T)^T \\mathbf{K} (\\nabla T) \\ge 0\n$$\nSince $T^2  0$, the non-negative entropy production condition requires that the quadratic form $(\\nabla T)^T \\mathbf{K} (\\nabla T)$ must be non-negative for any arbitrary temperature gradient $\\nabla T$. This means the thermal conductivity tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ must be positive semi-definite. Physically, heat must flow down a temperature gradient (from hot to cold), regardless of the gradient's direction. This implies that $(\\nabla T)^T \\mathbf{K} (\\nabla T)  0$ for any non-zero $\\nabla T$, meaning $\\mathbf{K}$ must be positive definite.\n\n$2$. **Symmetry**: Onsager's reciprocal relations, a cornerstone of LIT derived from the principle of microscopic reversibility, state that the tensor of phenomenological coefficients $\\mathbf{L}$ is symmetric, i.e., $\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{L}^T$. Since the thermal conductivity tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ is defined as $\\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{L}/T^2$, and $T^2$ is a scalar, $\\mathbf{K}$ must also be symmetric: $\\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{K}^T$.\n\nIn summary, the heat flux vector $\\mathbf{q}$ is linearly related to the temperature gradient $\\nabla T$ by a second-order tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ which is symmetric and positive definite.\n\nBecause $\\mathbf{K}$ is a real symmetric tensor, it is always possible to find a Cartesian coordinate system (the principal axes) in which $\\mathbf{K}$ is diagonal. The problem states that the coordinate system is aligned with these principal axes. Therefore, in this system, the tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ has the form:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} = \\begin{pmatrix} k_x  0 \\\\ 0  k_y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe component-wise relation for the heat flux vector $\\mathbf{q} = (q_x, q_y)$ is then:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} q_x \\\\ q_y \\end{pmatrix} = -\\begin{pmatrix} k_x  0 \\\\ 0  k_y \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial T / \\partial x \\\\ \\partial T / \\partial y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis yields the component-wise relations:\n$$\nq_x = -k_x \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q_y = -k_y \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Isotherms for a Line Heat Source**\n\nFor steady-state heat conduction in a region with no heat sources or sinks, the energy conservation equation is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0$. The problem describes a line source at the origin, so this equation holds for all points $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$.\n\nSubstituting the constitutive relation $\\mathbf{q} = -\\mathbf{K} \\nabla T$ into the energy equation gives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (-\\mathbf{K} \\nabla T) = 0\n$$\nSince the thermal conductivity tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ is spatially uniform, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{K} \\nabla T) = 0\n$$\nExpanding this in the principal coordinate system where $\\mathbf{K} = \\mathrm{diag}(k_x, k_y)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(k_x \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left(k_y \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $k_x$ and $k_y$ are constants, the governing partial differential equation for the temperature field $T(x,y)$ is:\n$$\nk_x \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + k_y \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is an anisotropic form of the Laplace equation.

Let $r' = \\sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2}$ be the radial coordinate in the transformed space. The general solution is:\n$$\nT(x', y') = C_1 \\ln(r') + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants. The constant $C_1$ is related to the source strength $\\dot{Q}''$, and $C_2$ is an arbitrary additive constant fixed by a reference temperature.\n\nIsotherms are lines of constant temperature, $T(x,y) = \\text{constant}$. From the solution form, this implies that $\\ln(r')$ must be constant, which in turn means $r'$ must be constant. Thus, the equation for any isotherm is:\n$$\nr' = \\text{constant}\n$$\nSubstituting back the definitions of $x'$ and $y'$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{k_x}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{k_y}}\\right)^2} = C_{iso}\n$$\nwhere $C_{iso}$ is a positive constant that defines a particular isotherm. Squaring both sides gives the explicit equation for the family of isotherms:\n$$\n\\frac{x^2}{k_x} + \\frac{y^2}{k_y} = C_{iso}^2\n$$\nThis is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin. To find the semi-axis lengths, we write it in the standard form $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{x^2}{k_x C_{iso}^2} + \\frac{y^2}{k_y C_{iso}^2} = 1\n$$\nBy comparing with the standard form, we identify the squares of the semi-axis lengths:\n$$\na^2 = k_x C_{iso}^2 \\quad \\implies \\quad a = \\sqrt{k_x} C_{iso}\n$$\n$$\nb^2 = k_y C_{iso}^2 \\quad \\implies \\quad b = \\sqrt{k_y} C_{iso}\n$$\nHere, $a$ is the semi-axis length along the $x$-axis (the $x$-intercept) and $b$ is the semi-axis length along the $y$-axis (the $y$-intercept). The problem requires the ratio $b/a$.\n$$\n\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k_y} C_{iso}}{\\sqrt{k_x} C_{iso}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k_y}}{\\sqrt{k_x}}\n$$\nThis ratio is independent of the specific isotherm (i.e., independent of $C_{iso}$). The aspect ratio of all elliptical isotherms is the same. The final expression is:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{a} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_y}{k_x}}\n$$\nThis result is physically intuitive: if the conductivity in the $x$-direction, $k_x$, is greater than in the $y$-direction, $k_y$, heat diffuses more easily along the $x$-axis. The isotherms will therefore be elongated along the $x$-axis, meaning $a  b$, which corresponds to a ratio $b/a  1$, consistent with the derived formula.",

Show that it has the structure\n$\\dfrac{d}{d x} \\left( k(x) \\dfrac{d T}{d x} \\right) = \\dfrac{1}{J(\\xi)} \\dfrac{d}{d \\xi} \\left( \\dfrac{k(x(\\xi))}{J(\\xi)} \\dfrac{d T}{d \\xi} \\right)$.\nOn a uniform grid in $\\xi$ of $N$ nodes with spacing $\\Delta \\xi = \\dfrac{1}{N-1}$, construct a conservative, second-order accurate discretization based on flux differences that is consistent with this divergence form and uses centered differences and centered face interpolation of the composite coefficient. Apply this discrete operator to the exact temperature sampled at the grid nodes, and compare against the exact $S(x)$ evaluated at the corresponding physical locations $x(\\xi)$.\n\nTo assess accuracy, compute the discrete $\\mathcal{L}^2$ error over interior nodes $i = 1,\\dots,N-2$ using quadrature weights corresponding to physical cell sizes. If $e_i$ denotes the pointwise difference between the discrete operator applied to the exact temperature and the exact source at node $i$, and if $\\Delta x_{i\\pm \\frac{1}{2}} = x_{i\\pm 1} - x_i$, define the nodal weight $w_i = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\left( \\Delta x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} + \\Delta x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}} \\right)$ and the error norm $E = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^{N-2} e_i^2 \\, w_i }$. Let the refinement parameter be $h = \\Delta \\xi$. Using three or more refinements, estimate the observed order of accuracy $p$ by a least-squares fit of $\\log E$ versus $\\log h$.\n\nImplement the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) verification with the following test suite:\n- Grid sizes $N \\in \\{ 33, 65, 129, 257 \\}$, so that $h \\in \\left\\{ \\dfrac{1}{32}, \\dfrac{1}{64}, \\dfrac{1}{128}, \\dfrac{1}{256} \\right\\}$.\n- Mapping cases: Case A, Case B, and Case C as defined above.\n\nFor each mapping case, compute the observed order $p$ from the sequence of errors across the specified $N$. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[resultA,resultB,resultC]\"), where each entry is the observed order $p$ for the corresponding mapping case, rounded to six decimal places. The outputs are dimensionless numbers, so no physical units are required. Angles must be interpreted in radians. Percentages must not be used; any fraction must be expressed as a decimal number.",
            "solution": "The task is to verify the second-order accuracy of a conservative finite-difference discretization for the one-dimensional heat conduction equation with spatially varying thermal conductivity on curvilinear grids. This verification will be performed using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS). The process involves several steps: deriving an exact source term from a manufactured solution, transforming the governing equation into a computational coordinate system, discretizing the transformed operator, and finally, measuring the convergence rate of the numerical error under grid refinement.\n\nThe governing equation in physical space $x$ is given by the conservation of energy:\n$$\n\\dfrac{d}{d x} \\left( k(x) \\dfrac{d T}{d x} \\right) = S(x)\n$$\nwhere $T(x)$ is the temperature, $k(x)$ is the thermal conductivity, and $S(x)$ is a volumetric heat source term.\n\nFirst, we establish the analytical foundation for the MMS test.\n\n**1. Manufactured Solution and Exact Source Term Derivation**\n\nWe are given a manufactured temperature field and a spatially varying thermal conductivity on the domain $x \\in [0,1]$:\n- Temperature: $T_{\\text{ex}}(x) = \\sin(2 \\pi x) + x^2$\n- Conductivity: $k(x) = 1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\sin(2 \\pi x)$\n\nTo ensure these functions satisfy the governing equation, we must derive the corresponding exact source term $S_{\\text{ex}}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( k(x) \\frac{d T_{\\text{ex}}}{dx} \\right)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the temperature gradient:\n$$\n\\dfrac{d T_{\\text{ex}}}{d x} = \\dfrac{d}{d x} \\left( \\sin(2 \\pi x) + x^2 \\right) = 2 \\pi \\cos(2 \\pi x) + 2x\n$$\nNext, we multiply by the conductivity $k(x)$ to get the negative of the heat flux, $-q_x(x)$:\n$$\nk(x) \\dfrac{d T_{\\text{ex}}}{d x} = \\left( 1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\sin(2 \\pi x) \\right) \\left( 2 \\pi \\cos(2 \\pi x) + 2x \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we differentiate this product with respect to $x$ to find $S_{\\text{ex}}(x)$:\n$$\nS_{\\text{ex}}(x) = \\dfrac{d}{d x} \\left[ \\left( 1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\sin(2 \\pi x) \\right) \\left( 2 \\pi \\cos(2 \\pi x) + 2x \\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the product rule $(uv)' = u'v + uv'$ with $u(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $v(x) = 2\\pi\\cos(2\\pi x) + 2x$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nu'(x) = \\pi \\cos(2 \\pi x) \\\\\nv'(x) = -4 \\pi^2 \\sin(2 \\pi x) + 2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSo, the source term is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_{\\text{ex}}(x) = \\left( \\pi \\cos(2 \\pi x) \\right) \\left( 2 \\pi \\cos(2 \\pi x) + 2x \\right) + \\left( 1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\sin(2 \\pi x) \\right) \\left( -4 \\pi^2 \\sin(2 \\pi x) + 2 \\right) \\\\\n= 2 \\pi^2 \\cos^2(2 \\pi x) + 2 \\pi x \\cos(2 \\pi x) - 4 \\pi^2 \\sin(2 \\pi x) + 2 - 2 \\pi^2 \\sin^2(2 \\pi x) + \\sin(2 \\pi x) \\\\\n= 2 \\pi^2 \\left( \\cos^2(2 \\pi x) - \\sin^2(2 \\pi x) \\right) + 2 \\pi x \\cos(2 \\pi x) + (1 - 4 \\pi^2) \\sin(2 \\pi x) + 2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nUsing the double angle identity $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta$, we obtain the final analytical expression for the source term:\n$$\nS_{\\text{ex}}(x) = 2 \\pi^2 \\cos(4 \\pi x) + 2 \\pi x \\cos(2 \\pi x) + (1 - 4 \\pi^2) \\sin(2 \\pi x) + 2\n$$\nThis analytical source term will serve as the benchmark against which our numerical approximation is compared.\n\n**2. Coordinate Transformation**\nTo handle curvilinear grids, we introduce a mapping from a uniform computational coordinate $\\xi \\in [0,1]$ to the physical coordinate $x \\in [0,1]$, denoted by $x(\\xi)$. The Jacobian of this transformation is $J(\\xi) = \\frac{dx}{d\\xi}$. Using the chain rule, the spatial derivative operator transforms as:\n$$\n\\dfrac{d}{dx} = \\dfrac{d\\xi}{dx} \\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} = \\dfrac{1}{J(\\xi)} \\dfrac{d}{d\\xi}\n$$\nApplying this to the governing equation:\n$$\n\\dfrac{1}{J(\\xi)} \\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} \\left( k(x(\\xi)) \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{J(\\xi)} \\dfrac{dT}{d\\xi} \\right] \\right) = S(x(\\xi))\n$$\nThis simplifies to the strong conservation law form in the computational coordinate:\n$$\n\\dfrac{1}{J(\\xi)} \\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} \\left( \\dfrac{k(x(\\xi))}{J(\\xi)} \\dfrac{dT}{d\\xi} \\right) = S(x(\\xi))\n$$\nThis is the equation we will discretize.\n\n**3. Numerical Discretization**\nWe discretize the domain $\\xi \\in [0,1]$ using $N$ nodes, creating a uniform grid $\\xi_i = i \\Delta\\xi$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, where the grid spacing is $\\Delta\\xi = \\frac{1}{N-1}$. The physical grid nodes are $x_i = x(\\xi_i)$.\n\nThe operator $L(T) = \\frac{1}{J} \\frac{d}{d\\xi} \\left( \\Gamma(\\xi) \\frac{dT}{d\\xi} \\right)$, where $\\Gamma(\\xi) = \\frac{k(x(\\xi))}{J(\\xi)}$, is discretized at each interior node $\\xi_i$ ($i=1, \\dots, N-2$) using a second-order accurate conservative finite-difference scheme. The divergence form suggests approximating the outer derivative using flux differences at cell faces, located at $\\xi_{i \\pm 1/2}$:\n$$\n\\left[ \\dfrac{d}{d\\xi} \\left( \\Gamma \\dfrac{dT}{d\\xi} \\right) \\right]_i \\approx \\dfrac{1}{\\Delta\\xi} \\left[ \\left( \\Gamma \\dfrac{dT}{d\\xi} \\right)_{i+1/2} - \\left( \\Gamma \\dfrac{dT}{d\\xi} \\right)_{i-1/2} \\right]\n$$\nThe terms at the cell faces are approximated using centered differences for the gradient and centered interpolation for the coefficient $\\Gamma$, as specified:\n- Flux at face $i+1/2$: $\\left( \\Gamma \\dfrac{dT}{d\\xi} \\right)_{i+1/2} \\approx \\Gamma_{i+1/2} \\left( \\dfrac{T_{i+1} - T_i}{\\Delta\\xi} \\right)$\n- Flux at face $i-1/2$: $\\left( \\Gamma \\dfrac{dT}{d\\xi} \\right)_{i-1/2} \\approx \\Gamma_{i-1/2} \\left( \\dfrac{T_i - T_{i-1}}{\\Delta\\xi} \\right)$\n- Interfacial coefficient: $\\Gamma_{i \\pm 1/2} \\approx \\dfrac{\\Gamma_i + \\Gamma_{i \\pm 1}}{2}$, where $\\Gamma_i = \\Gamma(\\xi_i)$.\n\nCombining these, the discrete operator $(L_h T)_i$ at node $i$ becomes:\n$$\n(L_h T)_i = \\dfrac{1}{J_i \\Delta\\xi} \\left[ \\left( \\dfrac{\\Gamma_{i+1}+\\Gamma_i}{2} \\right) \\left( \\dfrac{T_{i+1}-T_i}{\\Delta\\xi} \\right) - \\left( \\dfrac{\\Gamma_i+\\Gamma_{i-1}}{2} \\right) \\left( \\dfrac{T_i-T_{i-1}}{\\Delta\\xi} \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n(L_h T)_i = \\dfrac{1}{2 J_i (\\Delta\\xi)^2} \\left[ (\\Gamma_{i+1}+\\Gamma_i)(T_{i+1}-T_i) - (\\Gamma_i+\\Gamma_{i-1})(T_i-T_{i-1}) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $J_i = J(\\xi_i)$, $\\Gamma_i = k(x_i)/J_i$, and $T_i = T(x_i)$.\n\n**4. Error Analysis and Order of Accuracy**\nThe purpose of the MMS is to compute the truncation error of the discretization. The pointwise error at node $i$ is the difference between the discrete operator acting on the exact solution and the exact source term evaluated at that node:\n$$\ne_i = (L_h T_{\\text{ex}})_i - S_{\\text{ex}}(x_i)\n$$\nWe quantify the total error using a discrete $\\mathcal{L}^2$ norm, which accounts for non-uniform cell sizes in physical space. The norm is defined as:\n$$\nE = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^{N-2} e_i^2 w_i }\n$$\nThe summation is over all interior nodes. The quadrature weight $w_i$ represents the volume (or length in 1D) of the control volume associated with node $i$:\n$$\nw_i = \\dfrac{1}{2}((x_{i+1}-x_i) + (x_i-x_{i-1})) = \\dfrac{1}{2}(x_{i+1}-x_{i-1})\n$$\nThe theoretical convergence rate for a second-order scheme is given by $E \\approx C h^p$, where $h = \\Delta\\xi$ is the grid spacing parameter and $p$ is the order of accuracy. We expect $p \\approx 2$. To find the observed order of accuracy, we take the logarithm:\n$$\n\\log(E) \\approx \\log(C) + p \\log(h)\n$$\nThis shows a linear relationship between $\\log(E)$ and $\\log(h)$, where the slope is $p$. We compute the errors $E$ for a sequence of refined grids ($N \\in \\{33, 65, 129, 257\\}$) and then perform a linear least-squares fit to the points $(\\log(h_j), \\log(E_j))$ to determine the slope $p$.\n\nThe procedure is implemented for three grid mapping cases: a uniform grid (Case A), a mildly stretched grid (Case B), and a more strongly oscillated grid (Case C). The successful recovery of $p \\approx 2$ for all cases will verify that the chosen discretization is indeed second-order accurate on these curvilinear grids.",
