To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $5.00 \\times 10^2$.\n\n**4. Physical Interpretation**\n-   **Reynolds Number**: We found $\\text{Re} \\approx 667$. Since $\\text{Re} \\gg 1$, inertial forces are significantly larger than viscous forces. This indicates that momentum transport is dominated by **advection** (the bulk movement of the fluid) rather than by viscous diffusion (momentum transfer due to velocity gradients). The flow regime is likely transitional or weakly turbulent, not laminar (creeping) flow.\n\n-   **Péclet Number**: We found $\\text{Pe}_T = 500$. Since $\\text{Pe}_T \\gg 1$, the advection of thermal energy is much more significant than thermal diffusion (conduction). This means that heat is primarily transported by the bulk motion of the fluid, and conductive heat transfer plays a secondary role.\n\nIn summary, for both momentum and thermal energy in this near-nozzle region, **advection is the dominant transport mechanism over diffusion**. The large values of both $\\text{Re}$ and $\\text{Pe}_T$ signify a convection-dominated flow.\n\nThe final values for the Reynolds number and thermal Péclet number, rounded to three significant figures, are presented below.",

For a stationary flame, the incoming flow velocity must be balanced by the flame's propagation speed. The internal structure of the flame is governed by the balance between advection and diffusion, for which the characteristic velocity is the laminar flame speed, $S_L$.\n\nThe steady-state, one-dimensional conservation equation for energy, neglecting viscous dissipation and external body forces, is:\n$$ \\rho u \\frac{d(c_p T)}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\lambda \\frac{dT}{dx}\\right) + \\dot{\\omega}_T $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $u$ is the fluid velocity, $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, $T$ is the temperature, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $\\lambda$ is the thermal conductivity, and $\\dot{\\omega}_T$ is the heat release rate per unit volume from chemical reactions.\n\nThe corresponding conservation equation for a species mass fraction $Y$ is:\n$$ \\rho u \\frac{dY}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\rho D \\frac{dY}{dx}\\right) + \\dot{\\omega}_Y $$\nwhere $D$ is the mass diffusivity and $\\dot{\\omega}_Y$ is the net rate of production of the species per unit volume.\n\nTo perform an order-of-magnitude analysis, we consider the preheat zone of the flame where the reaction rate terms ($\\dot{\\omega}_T$ and $\\dot{\\omega}_Y$) are negligible. In this zone, the convective transport is balanced by diffusive transport. The velocity scale governing this internal balance is the laminar flame speed, $u \\sim S_L$.\n\n**Thermal Thickness Scale ($\\delta_T$)**\nAssuming constant $\\rho$ and $c_p$ for an order-of-magnitude analysis, the energy equation in the preheat zone simplifies to a balance between advection and diffusion:\n$$ \\rho c_p S_L \\frac{dT}{dx} \\sim \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\lambda \\frac{dT}{dx}\\right) $$\nLet $\\delta_T$ be the characteristic thickness of the thermal layer.

This group is known as the mesh Péclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\Delta}$. We begin by defining the characteristic time scales for advection and diffusion over a length scale $\\Delta$.\n\nThe characteristic time for a scalar to be advected across a distance $\\Delta$ by a uniform velocity $u$ is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{adv} = \\frac{\\Delta}{u}\n$$\nThe characteristic time for a scalar to diffuse over the same distance $\\Delta$ is determined by the molecular diffusivity $\\kappa$.

The calculated value is exactly $100$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it in scientific notation as $1.00 \\times 10^2$.\n\nNow, we discuss the implications of this value for a second-order central differencing scheme applied to the steady, one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation, which is $u \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} - \\kappa \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = 0$. Discretizing at a grid node $i$ using central differences gives:\n$$\nu \\left( \\frac{\\phi_{i+1} - \\phi_{i-1}}{2\\Delta} \\right) - \\kappa \\left( \\frac{\\phi_{i+1} - 2\\phi_i + \\phi_{i-1}}{\\Delta^2} \\right) = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $\\phi_i$:\n$$\n\\phi_i \\left( \\frac{2\\kappa}{\\Delta^2} \\right) = \\phi_{i+1} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa}{\\Delta^2} - \\frac{u}{2\\Delta} \\right) + \\phi_{i-1} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa}{\\Delta^2} + \\frac{u}{2\\Delta} \\right)\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\frac{\\Delta^2}{\\kappa}$ and simplifying:\n$$\n2\\phi_i = \\phi_{i+1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{u\\Delta}{2\\kappa} \\right) + \\phi_{i-1} \\left( 1 + \\frac{u\\Delta}{2\\kappa} \\right)\n$$\nRecognizing that $\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\Delta} = \\frac{u\\Delta}{\\kappa}$, we can write:\n$$\n\\phi_i = \\phi_{i+1} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\Delta}}{4} \\right) + \\phi_{i-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\Delta}}{4} \\right)\n$$\nFor the numerical solution to be monotonic (i.e., not produce non-physical oscillations or \"wiggles\"), the coefficients of the neighboring points $\\phi_{i+1}$ and $\\phi_{i-1}$ must be non-negative. This is a condition for the scheme to satisfy a discrete maximum principle. The coefficient of $\\phi_{i-1}$ is always non-negative for $u > 0$ and $\\Delta > 0$. The coefficient of $\\phi_{i+1}$ imposes the following constraint:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\Delta}}{4} \\ge 0 \\implies \\frac{\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\Delta}}{4} \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\mathrm{Pe}_{\\Delta} \\le 2\n$$\nOur computed value is $\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\Delta} = 100$, which severely violates this condition ($\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\Delta} \\gg 2$). This indicates that the central differencing scheme is unstable in the sense of producing spurious oscillations. Advection is strongly dominant at the grid scale, and the central difference approximation for the advection term, being purely dispersive and non-dissipative, introduces errors that the small physical diffusion term cannot damp. The result is a numerically oscillatory and non-monotonic solution, particularly around sharp gradients. This behavior is a form of numerical dispersion. To obtain a stable solution, one would need to refine the mesh such that $\\Delta \\le \\frac{2\\kappa}{u}$, or switch to a different discretization, such as a first-order upwind scheme (which introduces numerical diffusion but is monotonic) or a higher-order, non-oscillatory scheme.\n\nFinally, we connect these ideas to the canonical similarity parameters. The Péclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe}$, is defined for a characteristic flow length scale $L$ and velocity scale $U$ as $\\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{\\kappa}$. The Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re}$, is defined as $\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{UL}{\\nu}$, where $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. These two numbers are related a material property ratio, the Schmidt number $\\mathrm{Sc} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\kappa}$, which is the ratio of momentum diffusivity to mass diffusivity:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{\\kappa} = \\left(\\frac{UL}{\\nu}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\kappa}\\right) = \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Sc}\n$$\nIn the context of heat transfer, the relevant parameters are the Prandtl number $\\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha}$ (where $\\alpha$ is thermal diffusivity) and the thermal Péclet number $\\mathrm{Pe}_h = \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}$. In computational combustion, which involves reacting flows of gases, both Schmidt and Prandtl numbers are typically of order unity ($\\mathrm{Sc} \\approx \\mathrm{Pr} \\approx 0.7$). This implies $\\mathrm{Pe} \\approx \\mathrm{Re}$. A high-Reynolds-number turbulent flow is also a high-Péclet-number flow, meaning that advection dominates diffusion for both momentum, species, and energy at the large scales of the flow.\n\nThe mesh Péclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\Delta} = \\frac{u\\Delta}{\\kappa}$, is the local, grid-scale analogue of the global Péclet number. It is a crucial parameter in numerical methods because it determines the local cell-level balance of advective and diffusive fluxes and, as shown, dictates the stability and accuracy of the numerical scheme. A high $\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\Delta}$ signifies that the grid is too coarse to resolve the scalar gradients generated by the advection, leading to the numerical issues discussed.",
