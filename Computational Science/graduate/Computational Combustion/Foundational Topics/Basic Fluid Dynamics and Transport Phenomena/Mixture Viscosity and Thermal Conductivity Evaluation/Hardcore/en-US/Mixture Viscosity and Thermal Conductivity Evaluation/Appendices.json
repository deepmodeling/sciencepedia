You must also compute a binary mixture viscosity using a standard mixing rule to demonstrate mixture property evaluation.\n\nYou must base your derivations on accepted results from kinetic theory and transport theory, starting from the Boltzmann transport equation framework and results from the Chapman–Enskog method, together with a well-tested correlation for collision integrals for the Lennard–Jones (12–6) potential, but without relying on any shortcut formulas given directly in the problem statement.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and consistent with established principles of transport theory and computational combustion. All necessary data are provided, and the required derivations and computations are standard procedures in the field.\n\nThe task is to compute the dynamic viscosity of nitrogen ($\\mathrm{N_2}$) and oxygen ($\\mathrm{O_2}$) using two distinct models: one derived from first-principles kinetic theory with the Lennard-Jones potential, and the other based on the empirical Sutherland's law. Subsequently, the viscosity of a binary mixture of these gases is calculated using Wilke's mixing rule.\n\n### 1. Viscosity from Kinetic Theory and the Lennard-Jones Potential\n\nThe kinetic theory of dilute gases, through the Chapman-Enskog method, provides a rigorous framework for calculating transport properties from molecular interactions. For a pure gas composed of spherically symmetric molecules, the first-order approximation for dynamic viscosity, $\\mu$, is given by:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{5}{16} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi m k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}}{\\pi \\sigma^2 \\Omega^{(2,2)\\,*}(T^*)}\n$$\nHere, $m$ is the mass of a single molecule, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant ($1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$), $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and $\\sigma$ is the effective collision diameter from the Lennard-Jones potential. The term $\\Omega^{(2,2)\\,*}(T^*)$ is the dimensionless collision integral for viscosity, which corrects the hard-sphere model for the complexities of an actual intermolecular potential. It is a function of the reduced temperature, $T^*$, defined as:\n$$\nT^* = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{T}{\\epsilon/k_{\\mathrm{B}}}\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the depth of the potential well in the Lennard-Jones potential. The molecular mass $m$ can be expressed in terms of the molar mass $M$ and Avogadro's number $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$ as $m = M/N_{\\mathrm{A}}$. By substituting this and grouping constants, the equation can be written in a more practical form where $M$ is in $\\mathrm{g/mol}$ and $\\sigma$ is in Angstroms ($\\text{\\AA}$):\n$$\n\\mu(T) = 2.6693 \\times 10^{-6} \\frac{\\sqrt{M T}}{\\sigma^2 \\Omega^{(2,2)\\,*}(T^*)}\n$$\nThe resulting viscosity $\\mu$ is in units of $\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$. For the Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential, the collision integral $\\Omega^{(2,2)\\,*}(T^*)$ is typically evaluated using a numerical correlation. A widely used and accurate correlation, valid for the temperature range in this problem, is given by Neufeld et al. (1972):\n$$\n\\Omega^{(2,2)\\,*}(T^*) = \\frac{A}{(T^*)^B} + \\frac{C}{\\exp(D T^*)} + \\frac{E}{\\exp(F T^*)}\n$$\nwith the constants:\n$A = 1.16145$, $B = 0.14874$, $C = 0.52487$, $D = 0.77320$, $E = 2.16178$, $F = 2.43787$.\n\n### 2. Viscosity from Sutherland's Law\n\nSutherland's law is a semi-empirical formula that provides a good approximation for the viscosity of gases over a moderate temperature range. It is an improvement over the simple hard-sphere model prediction ($\\mu \\propto \\sqrt{T}$) by accounting for intermolecular attractive forces. The standard form of the law is:\n$$\n\\mu(T) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left( \\frac{T}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\right)^{3/2} \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ref}} + S}{T + S}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is a known reference viscosity at a reference temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, and $S$ is the Sutherland constant, which has units of temperature and is characteristic of the gas. The problem provides all necessary species-specific parameters for $\\mathrm{N_2}$ and $\\mathrm{O_2}$.\n\n### 3. Mixture Viscosity using Wilke's Rule\n\nFor a mixture of gases, the viscosity is not a simple linear combination of the pure-component viscosities. Wilke's mixing rule is a commonly used empirical method to estimate the viscosity of a gas mixture:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{x_i \\mu_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} x_j \\phi_{ij}}\n$$\nIn this expression, $x_i$ and $\\mu_i$ are the mole fraction and pure-species viscosity of component $i$, respectively. The interaction coefficient $\\phi_{ij}$ models the effect of collisions between species $i$ and $j$ and is defined as:\n$$\n\\phi_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{M_i}{M_j} \\right)^{-1/2} \\left[ 1 + \\left( \\frac{\\mu_i}{\\mu_j} \\right)^{1/2} \\left( \\frac{M_j}{M_i} \\right)^{1/4} \\right]^2\n$$\nwhere $M_i$ and $M_j$ are the molar masses of the species. For $i=j$, the formula correctly simplifies to $\\phi_{ii} = 1$. The calculation will be performed for a binary mixture of $\\mathrm{N_2}$ and $\\mathrm{O_2}$, where the pure-species viscosities $\\mu_i$ are obtained from both the Lennard-Jones and Sutherland models at the specified temperature.\n\n### 4. Implementation and Calculation\n\nThe computational procedure involves implementing the three models described above.\nFirst, functions for the Lennard-Jones viscosity (including the collision integral correlation) and Sutherland's law are created. These functions take temperature and species-specific parameters as input.\nSecond, a function for Wilke's mixing rule is implemented, which takes mole fractions and the pure-species properties (viscosities and molar masses) to compute the mixture viscosity.\nThe program then iterates through the specified test temperatures ($500\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $1200\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $2500\\,\\mathrm{K}$) to calculate the pure-species viscosities for $\\mathrm{N_2}$ and $\\mathrm{O_2}$ using both models.\nFinally, the mixture viscosities are calculated at $1200\\,\\mathrm{K}$ for the given mole fractions ($x_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 0.79$, $x_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 0.21$), once using LJ-based pure viscosities and once using Sutherland-based pure viscosities.\nAll final values are rounded to six significant figures before being formatted into the required output string.",

            "solution": "We begin from the kinetic theory description of heat transport in dilute gases, where the thermal conductivity $k$ emerges from the Chapman–Enskog (CE) expansion applied to the Boltzmann equation. For polyatomic ideal gases, a widely used and well-tested closure connecting $k$ and the dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ is the modified Eucken relation, which augments the monatomic result by accounting for internal energy transport due to rotations and vibrations. In specific-quantity form (per unit mass), this relation can be written as\n$$\nk \\approx \\mu\\left(c_{p} + \\frac{5}{4} R_{s}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $c_{p}$ is the specific heat at constant pressure per unit mass and $R_{s}$ is the specific gas constant per unit mass.

            "problem": "You are to develop a complete, runnable program that evaluates mixture viscosity and thermal conductivity for binary and ternary gas mixtures using first-principles kinetic theory consistent with computational combustion practice. Begin from the kinetic theory of gases and the Chapman–Enskog method (CEM) for dilute gases, where transport coefficients arise from linearized solutions of the Boltzmann equation with pairwise interactions modeled by the Lennard–Jones potential. From that foundation, derive how the Mason–Saxena extension partitions thermal conductivity into translational and internal modes and how Wilke-type mixture-averaging emerges from molecular momentum and energy exchange rates, emphasizing terms that capture strong disparity in molecular masses. Then implement the resulting algorithm and conduct numerical tests on helium–air mixtures where air is modeled as a binary mixture of nitrogen and oxygen.\n\nScientific and algorithmic requirements:\n- Base single-species viscosity evaluation on the Lennard–Jones collision model combined with Chapman–Enskog theory. Use the dilute-gas, low-density limit. Explicitly model the reduced temperature dependence of the collision integral.\n- Base single-species thermal conductivity on the modified Eucken relation, decomposing total conductivity into translational and internal contributions that depend on single-species dynamic viscosity and specific heat at constant pressure.\n- Derive and use a Wilke-type mixture-averaging rule for viscosity with binary interaction weighting that depends on molecular weight ratios and single-species viscosities, and extend this rule analogously to the Mason–Saxena two-term thermal conductivity (translational and internal parts). Explain why and how the weighting accounts for significant disparity in molecular masses.\n- Treat air as a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with fixed internal composition. Let the mole fraction of helium be $x_{\\mathrm{He}}$, and distribute the remainder $1-x_{\\mathrm{He}}$ between nitrogen and oxygen as $x_{\\mathrm{N_2}}=0.79\\,(1-x_{\\mathrm{He}})$ and $x_{\\mathrm{O_2}}=0.21\\,(1-x_{\\mathrm{He}})$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the development of an algorithm and a corresponding program to compute the dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity of helium-air mixtures based on the kinetic theory of dilute gases. The solution is derived from first principles as specified, starting with the Chapman–Enskog method (CEM) for single-species properties and extending to mixtures using Wilke-type averaging rules and the Mason–Saxena formulation for thermal conductivity.\n\n### 1. Theoretical Framework: Kinetic Theory and Chapman–Enskog Method\n\nThe foundation for evaluating transport properties of dilute gases is the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical evolution of a system of particles. The Chapman–Enskog method provides a perturbative solution to the Boltzmann equation, yielding expressions for transport coefficients like viscosity ($\\mu$) and thermal conductivity ($k$) in terms of molecular properties and interaction potentials. For dilute gases, where only binary collisions are significant, these properties depend on temperature, molecular mass, and collision cross-sections. The interactions between nonpolar molecules are well-modeled by the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, which is a function of a characteristic energy $\\epsilon$ and a characteristic length $\\sigma$.\n\n### 2. Single-Species Viscosity ($\\mu_i$)\n\nThe first-order CEM solution for the dynamic viscosity of a pure, dilute gas (species $i$) is given by:\n$$ \\mu_i = \\frac{5}{16} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi m_i k_B T}}{\\pi \\sigma_i^2 \\Omega_{\\mu}(T_i^*)} $$\nwhere $m_i$ is the mass of a single molecule, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\sigma_i$ is the LJ collision diameter for species $i$. The term $\\Omega_{\\mu}(T_i^*)$ is the reduced collision integral for viscosity, a dimensionless function that corrects the rigid-sphere model for the complexities of the LJ potential. It depends on the reduced temperature, $T_i^* = k_B T / \\epsilon_i$, where $\\epsilon_i$ is the LJ potential well depth.\n\nFor practical computation, it is convenient to express this formula using molar mass $M_i$ (in $\\mathrm{g/mol}$), temperature $T$ (in $\\mathrm{K}$), and collision diameter $\\sigma_i$ (in $\\text{\\AA}$). This leads to the standard engineering formula for viscosity in $\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$:\n$$ \\mu_i = 2.6693 \\times 10^{-6} \\frac{\\sqrt{M_i T}}{\\sigma_i^2 \\Omega_{\\mu}(T_i^*)} $$\nThe collision integral $\\Omega_{\\mu}(T^*)$ is typically obtained from a standard correlation. A widely used fit by Neufeld, Janzen, and Aziz is:\n$$ \\Omega_{\\mu}(T^*) = \\frac{A}{(T^*)^B} + \\frac{C}{\\exp(D T^*)} + \\frac{E}{\\exp(F T^*)} $$\nwith the constants $A=1.16145$, $B=0.14874$, $C=0.52487$, $D=0.77320$, $E=2.16178$, and $F=2.43787$.\n\n### 3. Single-Species Thermal Conductivity ($k_i$)\n\nThermal conductivity in a gas arises from the transport of energy. Kinetic theory distinguishes between energy transported by molecular translation and by internal modes (rotation and vibration).\n$$ k_i = k_{tr,i} + k_{int,i} $$\nThe CEM directly relates translational thermal conductivity to viscosity for any gas:\n$$ k_{tr,i} = \\frac{5}{2} c_{v,tr} \\mu_i = \\frac{5}{2} \\left(\\frac{3}{2} R_i\\right) \\mu_i = \\frac{15}{4} R_i \\mu_i $$\nwhere $R_i = R_u / M_i$ is the specific gas constant for species $i$.\n\nThe contribution from internal energy modes, $k_{int,i}$, is more complex. The modified Eucken relation provides a robust approximation. A common formulation is:\n$$ k_i = \\mu_i \\left( c_{p,i} + \\frac{5}{4} R_i \\right) $$\nwhere $c_{p,i}$ is the specific heat at constant pressure. This relation holds for both monatomic and polyatomic gases under the assumption that the diffusion coefficient for internal energy is approximately equal to the self-diffusion coefficient.\n\nTo support the Mason-Saxena extension for mixtures, we must explicitly calculate both components. A consistent decomposition is:\n$$ k_{tr,i} = \\frac{15}{4} R_i \\mu_i $$\n$$ k_{int,i} = k_i - k_{tr,i} = \\mu_i \\left(c_{p,i} + \\frac{5}{4} R_i\\right) - \\frac{15}{4} R_i \\mu_i = \\mu_i \\left(c_{p,i} - \\frac{10}{4} R_i\\right) = \\mu_i \\left(c_{p,i} - \\frac{5}{2} R_i\\right) $$\nFor the species in this problem:\n- Monatomic gas (Helium): $c_{p,\\text{He}} = \\frac{5}{2} R_{\\text{He}}$. Thus, $k_{int,\\text{He}} = 0$.\n- Diatomic gas (Nitrogen, Oxygen): $c_{p,i} = \\frac{7}{2} R_i$ (rigid rotor approximation). Thus, $k_{int,i} = \\mu_i \\left(\\frac{7}{2} R_i - \\frac{5}{2} R_i\\right) = \\mu_i R_i$.\n\n### 4. Mixture Viscosity ($\\mu_{\\text{mix}}$)\n\nFor a multi-component gas mixture, the viscosity is not a simple linear average of the pure-species viscosities. Wilke's mixture-averaging rule, derived from an approximation to the full CEM solution for mixtures, provides an accurate estimate:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{mix}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{x_i \\mu_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} x_j \\Phi_{ij}} $$\nwhere $x_i$ is the mole fraction of species $i$, $\\mu_i$ is its pure-species viscosity, and $\\Phi_{ij}$ is a binary interaction coefficient that models the effect of collisions between species $i$ and $j$ on momentum transport. The formula for $\\Phi_{ij}$ is:\n$$ \\Phi_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{M_i}{M_j} \\right)^{-1/2} \\left[ 1 + \\left( \\frac{\\mu_i}{\\mu_j} \\right)^{1/2} \\left( \\frac{M_j}{M_i} \\right)^{1/4} \\right]^2 $$\nThe molecular weight ratio terms, $M_i/M_j$, are critical. When a light species $i$ moves through a heavy species $j$, $M_i/M_j \\ll 1$, making $\\Phi_{ij}$ large. This significantly reduces the contribution of the light species to the total mixture viscosity, correctly capturing that its momentum is easily altered by collisions with heavier partners.\n\n### 5. Mixture Thermal Conductivity ($k_{\\text{mix}}$)\n\nA simple application of the Wilke rule to total thermal conductivity ($k_i$) can be inaccurate, especially for mixtures containing light species like helium. The Mason–Saxena extension improves accuracy by applying the mixing rule separately to the translational and internal components of conductivity:\n$$ k_{\\text{mix}} = k_{tr,\\text{mix}} + k_{int,\\text{mix}} $$\nEach component is calculated using a Wilke-type weighting:\n$$ k_{tr,\\text{mix}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{x_i k_{tr,i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} x_j \\Phi_{ij}} $$\n$$ k_{int,\\text{mix}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{x_i k_{int,i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} x_j \\Phi_{ij}} $$\nThe same interaction coefficients $\\Phi_{ij}$ derived for viscosity are used in both sums. This method correctly handles the distinct transport mechanisms of translational and internal energy, yielding more reliable results for mixtures with disparate molecular masses and structures.\n\n### 6. Algorithmic Implementation\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case $(T, x_{\\text{He}})$:\n1.  **Species Mole Fractions**: Calculate $x_{\\text{N}_2} = 0.79(1 - x_{\\text{He}})$ and $x_{\\text{O}_2} = 0.21(1 - x_{\\text{He}})$.\n2.  **Pure Species Properties**: For each species $i \\in \\{\\text{He, N}_2\\text{, O}_2\\}$:\n    a. Convert $M_i$ to $\\mathrm{kg/mol}$ and $\\sigma_i$ to $\\mathrm{m}$.\n    b. Calculate reduced temperature $T_i^* = k_B T / \\epsilon_i = T / (\\epsilon_i/k_B)$.\n    c. Evaluate the collision integral $\\Omega_{\\mu}(T_i^*)$ using the specified correlation.\n    d. Compute pure-species viscosity $\\mu_i$ using the engineering formula. All inputs should be in their specified units ($\\mathrm{g/mol}$, $\\text{\\AA}$).\n    e. Compute the specific gas constant $R_i = R_u / M_i$ (using $M_i$ in $\\mathrm{kg/mol}$).\n    f. Determine $c_{p,i}$ based on whether the species is monatomic or diatomic.\n    g. Calculate the translational and internal thermal conductivities, $k_{tr,i}$ and $k_{int,i}$, using the derived formulas.\n3.  **Interaction Matrix**: Compute the $3 \\times 3$ matrix of $\\Phi_{ij}$ coefficients. Note that $\\Phi_{ii} = 1$.\n4.  **Mixture Properties**:\n    a. Calculate the denominator for each species $i$: $D_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} x_j \\Phi_{ij}$.\n    b. Compute mixture viscosity: $\\mu_{\\text{mix}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (x_i \\mu_i) / D_i$.\n    c. Compute mixture translational conductivity: $k_{tr,\\text{mix}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (x_i k_{tr,i}) / D_i$.\n    d. Compute mixture internal conductivity: $k_{int,\\text{mix}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (x_i k_{int,i}) / D_i$.\n    e. Sum the components for total mixture conductivity: $k_{\\text{mix}} = k_{tr,\\text{mix}} + k_{int,\\text{mix}}$.\n5.  **Output**: Store the resulting pair $[\\mu_{\\text{mix}}, k_{\\text{mix}}]$.
