The wall at $x=0$ is instantaneously set and maintained at a fixed hydrogen mass fraction $Y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}(x=0,t)=Y_s$, and the domain is initially free of hydrogen, $Y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}(x,0)=0$ for $x0$.

            "solution": "The user-provided problem has been assessed and is determined to be **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of transport phenomena and computational methods. It is self-contained, with all necessary parameters, initial conditions, and boundary conditions provided. The underlying physics of Fickian diffusion is correctly stated, and the request to derive the governing equation, implement a standard numerical scheme, and validate it against a known analytical solution constitutes a standard and meaningful exercise in computational science.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Governing Equation**\n\nThe starting point is the general conservation equation for a chemical species $i$ in a multicomponent mixture:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\rho Y_i)}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho Y_i \\mathbf{v}) = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_i + \\dot{\\omega}_i\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the total mass density, $Y_i$ is the mass fraction of species $i$, $t$ is time, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the bulk fluid velocity vector, $\\mathbf{J}_i$ is the diffusive mass flux vector of species $i$, and $\\dot{\\omega}_i$ is the mass production rate of species $i$ due to chemical reactions.\n\nThe problem states several simplifying assumptions, which we apply sequentially:\n1.  The mixture is quiescent, so bulk convection is negligible. This implies $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n2.  The process is non-reacting, so the mass production rate is zero: $\\dot{\\omega}_i = 0$.\n3.  The diffusion is one-dimensional along the coordinate $x$, so the divergence operator simplifies: $\\nabla \\cdot \\rightarrow \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$.\n4.  The total mass density $\\rho$ is uniform and constant.\n\nApplying these assumptions to the general conservation equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\rho Y_i)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J_{i,x}}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSince $\\rho$ is constant, it can be factored out of the time derivative:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial Y_i}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J_{i,x}}{\\partial x} \\implies \\frac{\\partial Y_i}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial J_{i,x}}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a binary mixture of hydrogen ($\\mathrm{H_2}$) and nitrogen ($\\mathrm{N_2}$). For such a mixture, the diffusive flux can be modeled by Fick's first law, which is a simplification of the Maxwell-Stefan equations under these conditions. The mass flux of species $i$ relative to the mass-averaged velocity (which is zero here) is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_i = -\\rho D_{ij} \\nabla Y_i\n$$\nFor the one-dimensional diffusion of hydrogen ($\\mathrm{H_2}$) into nitrogen ($\\mathrm{N_2}$), we write the flux component $J_{\\mathrm{H_2},x}$ as:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{H_2},x} = -\\rho D_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}} \\frac{\\partial Y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $D_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}$ is the binary diffusion coefficient.\n\nSubstituting this constitutive relation for the flux into the simplified conservation equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( -\\rho D_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}} \\frac{\\partial Y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{\\partial x} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem further assumes that the diffusion coefficient $D_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}$ is constant. With both $\\rho$ and $D_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}$ being constants, they can be moved outside the spatial derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\rho D_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial^2 Y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the one-dimensional linear diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{\\partial t} = D_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}} \\frac{\\partial^2 Y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nLetting $Y(x,t)$ denote $Y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}(x,t)$ and $D$ denote $D_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}$, we have the final partial differential equation (PDE) to be solved.\n\n**2. Analytical Solution**\n\nThe problem is defined on $x \\in [0, L]$ with boundary conditions $Y(0,t)=Y_s$ and $Y(L,t)=0$, and initial condition $Y(x,0)=0$. The problem states that for the times of interest, the finite domain approximates a semi-infinite half-space ($x \\in [0, \\infty)$). For this semi-infinite case with boundary conditions $Y(0,t)=Y_s$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} Y(x,t)=0$, the analytical solution to the diffusion equation is given by:\n$$\nY_{\\text{analytical}}(x,t) = Y_s \\cdot \\text{erfc}\\left( \\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt}} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\text{erfc}(z)$ is the complementary error function, defined as $\\text{erfc}(z) = 1 - \\text{erf}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_z^\\infty e^{-\\xi^2} d\\xi$. This solution will serve as the reference against which the numerical result is validated. The approximation is valid as long as the diffusion length, proportional to $\\sqrt{Dt}$, is significantly smaller than the domain length $L$, ensuring $Y(L,t) \\approx 0$.\n\n**3. Numerical Scheme: Explicit Finite-Difference Method**\n\nWe discretize the domain in space and time. A uniform spatial grid is defined by points $x_j = j \\cdot \\Delta x$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, N_x-1$, where the grid spacing is $\\Delta x = L / (N_x - 1)$. Time is discretized into steps $t_n = n \\cdot \\Delta t$. We denote the numerical approximation of $Y(x_j, t_n)$ as $Y_j^n$.\n\nThe PDE is approximated using finite differences:\n- The time derivative is approximated with a first-order forward difference: $\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{Y_j^{n+1} - Y_j^n}{\\Delta t}$.\n- The spatial second derivative is approximated with a second-order central difference: $\\frac{\\partial^2 Y}{\\partial x^2} \\approx \\frac{Y_{j+1}^n - 2Y_j^n + Y_{j-1}^n}{\\Delta x^2}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the PDE gives the Forward-Time Central-Space (FTCS) scheme:\n$$\n\\frac{Y_j^{n+1} - Y_j^n}{\\Delta t} = D \\left( \\frac{Y_{j+1}^n - 2Y_j^n + Y_{j-1}^n}{\\Delta x^2} \\right)\n$$\nSolving for $Y_j^{n+1}$ gives the explicit update rule for the interior grid points ($j=1, \\dots, N_x-2$):\n$$\nY_j^{n+1} = Y_j^n + \\alpha \\left( Y_{j+1}^n - 2Y_j^n + Y_{j-1}^n \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha = \\frac{D \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}$ is the dimensionless diffusion number.\n\nThe FTCS scheme is only conditionally stable. Stability requires $\\alpha \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, which imposes a constraint on the time step: $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2D}$. The problem defines $\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2D}$ and specifies the time step as $\\Delta t = r \\cdot \\Delta t_{\\max}$ with a stability ratio factor $r  1$ (e.g., $r=0.4$ or $r=0.49$). This gives a diffusion number $\\alpha = \\frac{D (r \\cdot \\Delta x^2 / (2D))}{\\Delta x^2} = \\frac{r}{2}$. Since $r1$, the stability condition $\\alpha  1/2$ is always satisfied.\n\n**4. Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nThe numerical solution is computed as follows:\n1.  For each test case, the parameters $D, L, N_x, Y_s, t_{\\text{end}}, r$ are specified.\n2.  The spatial grid spacing $\\Delta x = L / (N_x - 1)$ and the time step $\\Delta t = r \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2D}$ are calculated.\n3.  The total number of time steps is determined by $N_t = \\lceil t_{\\text{end}} / \\Delta t \\rceil$ to ensure the simulation runs up to or slightly beyond $t_{\\text{end}}$. The final time of the numerical simulation is $t_{\\text{final}} = N_t \\Delta t$.\n4.  A one-dimensional array `Y` of size $N_x$ is initialized to represent the mass fraction profile. The initial condition $Y(x,0)=0$ for $x0$ and $Y(0,t)=Y_s$ for $t \\ge 0$ is imposed by setting $Y_0 = Y_s$ and $Y_j=0$ for $j  0$. The far-field boundary condition is $Y_{N_x-1}=0$.\n5.  A time-stepping loop iterates $N_t$ times. In each iteration, the values of `Y` at the next time step are computed from the values at the current time step using the FTCS update rule. This is performed efficiently using vectorized array operations on the interior points. The boundary values at $j=0$ and $j=N_x-1$ remain fixed throughout the simulation.\n6.  After the loop completes, the array `Y` contains the numerical solution $Y_{\\text{numerical}}(x_j)$ at time $t_{\\text{final}}$.\n7.  The analytical solution $Y_{\\text{analytical}}(x_j)$ is computed at each grid point $x_j$ at the same final time $t_{\\text{final}}$ for a consistent comparison.\n8.  The Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) is calculated between the numerical and analytical solutions:\n$$\n\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N_x} \\sum_{j=0}^{N_x-1} \\left( Y_{\\text{numerical}}(x_j) - Y_{\\text{analytical}}(x_j) \\right)^2 }\n$$\nThis procedure is repeated for each test case provided.",

This is followed by the computational implementation of this expression.\n\nThe Lewis number for a species $i$ is defined as the ratio of the thermal diffusivity of the mixture, $\\alpha$, to the mass diffusivity of the species, $D_i$:\n$$Le_i = \\frac{\\alpha}{D_i}$$\nThe thermal diffusivity is given by $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c_p)$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity, $\\rho$ is the mass density, and $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure. Substituting this into the Lewis number definition gives:\n$$Le_i(T, p) = \\frac{k(T)}{\\rho(T, p) c_p(T) D_i(T, p)}$$\nThe problem provides the following temperature- and pressure-dependent correlations for the transport and thermodynamic properties:\n1.  Thermal conductivity: $k(T) = k_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{0.9}$\n2.  Specific heat: $c_p(T) = c_{p0} + b(T - T_0)$\n3.  Mass density (from ideal gas law): $\\rho(T, p) = \\frac{p}{R_m T}$\n4.  Mass diffusivity: $D_i(T, p) = D_{i0} \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{1.75} \\left(\\frac{p_0}{p}\\right)$\n\nLet us substitute these expressions into the equation for $Le_i(T, p)$:\n$$Le_i(T, p) = \\frac{k_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{0.9}}{\\left(\\frac{p}{R_m T}\\right) \\left(c_{p0} + b(T-T_0)\\right) \\left(D_{i0} \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{1.75} \\left(\\frac{p_0}{p}\\right)\\right)}$$\nWe can rearrange and group the terms to analyze the dependencies:\n$$Le_i(T, p) = \\frac{k_0 R_m T \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{0.9}}{p \\left(c_{p0} + b(T-T_0)\\right)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{D_{i0} \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{1.75} \\left(\\frac{p_0}{p}\\right)}$$\n$$Le_i(T, p) = \\left( \\frac{k_0 R_m}{D_{i0} p_0} \\right) \\left( \\frac{p}{p} \\right) \\frac{T \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{0.9}}{\\left(c_{p0} + b(T-T_0)\\right) \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{1.75}}$$\nA critical observation here is that the pressure term, $p$, cancels out. This means that for the specific set of correlations provided (which are standard approximations in combustion theory), the Lewis number is independent of pressure, i.e., $Le_i(T, p) = Le_i(T)$. Consequently, the calculations for all three test cases (Case A, B, and C), which differ only by pressure, will yield identical results.\n\nWe can further simplify the pressure-independent expression for $Le_i(T)$:\n$$Le_i(T) = \\left( \\frac{k_0 R_m}{p_0 D_{i0}} \\right) \\frac{T \\cdot T^{0.9} \\cdot T_0^{-0.9}}{(c_{p0} + b(T-T_0)) \\cdot T^{1.75} \\cdot T_0^{-1.75}}$$\nCombining the powers of $T$ and $T_0$:\n$$Le_i(T) = \\left( \\frac{k_0 R_m T_0^{1.75 - 0.9}}{p_0 D_{i0}} \\right) \\frac{T^{1 + 0.9 - 1.75}}{c_{p0} + b(T-T_0)}$$\n$$Le_i(T) = \\left( \\frac{k_0 R_m T_0^{0.85}}{p_0 D_{i0}} \\right) \\frac{T^{0.15}}{c_{p0} + b(T-T_0)}$$\nThis final expression is a function of temperature $T$ only. The term in the parentheses is a constant for each species $i$.\n\nThe diffusion-thermal skew ratio, $s_i(T)$, is then computed directly from the Lewis number:\n$$s_i(T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{Le_i(T)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{Le_i(T)}}$$\n\nThe computational procedure involves the following steps for each test case:\n1.  Initialize empty lists to store the computed values for each of the $5$ temperatures in the grid.\n2.  Iterate through each temperature $T$ in the provided grid: $[300, 800, 1200, 1800, 2200] \\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n3.  For each species $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{H_2}, \\mathrm{CO_2}\\}$, calculate $Le_i(T)$ using the derived pressure-independent formula and the given constants:\n    - $R_u = 8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J/(mol \\cdot K)}$, $M_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 0.02897 \\ \\mathrm{kg/mol}$, so $R_m = R_u/M_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\approx 287.0 \\ \\mathrm{J/(kg \\cdot K)}$.\n    - $T_0 = 300 \\ \\mathrm{K}$, $p_0 = 101325 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, $k_0 = 0.026 \\ \\mathrm{W/(m \\cdot K)}$.\n    - $c_{p0} = 1007 \\ \\mathrm{J/(kg \\cdot K)}$, $b = 0.2 \\ \\mathrm{J/(kg \\cdot K^2)}$.\n    - $D_{\\mathrm{H_2},0} = 6.3 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$, $D_{\\mathrm{CO_2},0} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n4.  Calculate the corresponding skew ratio $s_i(T)$.\n5.  Append the calculated $Le_i(T)$ and $s_i(T)$ values to their respective lists.\n6.  After iterating through all temperatures, calculate the arithmetic mean of the values in the $Le_{\\mathrm{H_2}}(T)$ and $Le_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}(T)$ lists.\n7.  Evaluate the boolean conditions $| \\overline{Le}_{\\mathrm{H_2}} - 1 | \\ge 0.2$ and $| \\overline{Le}_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} - 1 | \\ge 0.2$.\n8.  Assemble the eight required outputs (four lists, two floats, two booleans) into a single result list for the case.\n\nSince $Le_i$ and $s_i$ are pressure-independent, the final result list will be identical for Case A, B, and C.",

This practice delves into the practical consequences of such approximations by comparing the common mixture-averaged diffusion model against a more detailed multicomponent formulation.

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional, planar, premixed reacting mixture with three chemical species: a fuel $F$, an oxidizer $O$, and an inert $N$. Let the unburned mixture be spatially uniform far upstream ($x \\to +\\infty$) with temperature $T_u$ and composition characterized by mole fractions $\\{X_F,X_O,X_N\\}$ and corresponding mass fractions $\\{Y_F,Y_O,Y_N\\}$, and let the burned products be far downstream ($x \\to -\\infty$). Assume low Mach number conditions, constant pressure, and negligible Soret (thermal diffusion) and baro-diffusion, so that molecular transport is governed by Fickian diffusion.\n\nTo focus on the effect of multicomponent diffusion versus mixture-averaged diffusion on the laminar flame speed, we consider a scalar reaction progress variable $c(x,t) \\in [0,1]$ that monotonically increases from $c=0$ in the unburned state to $c=1$ in the burned state. Near the leading edge of a freely propagating flame, where $c \\ll 1$, suppose the net reaction source term for $c$ can be linearly approximated as $R(c) \\approx k_{\\mathrm{lin}}\\,c$ with a constant linearized rate coefficient $k_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ (units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Under the assumptions above and neglecting convection in the laboratory frame, the governing equation for $c$ is a reaction-diffusion equation,\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} + k_{\\mathrm{lin}}\\,c\\,(1-c),\n$$\nwhere $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is an effective diffusivity that reflects the molecular transport closure chosen for the multicomponent mixture. The equation admits a rightward-traveling wave solution $c(x,t) = \\hat{c}(x - S\\,t)$ connecting $c=1$ at $x \\to -\\infty$ to $c=0$ at $x \\to +\\infty$ with wave speed $S$. By linearizing at $c\\approx 0$, the minimal wave speed is determined by the balance between diffusion and linear growth and is given by\n$$\nS = 2\\,\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,k_{\\mathrm{lin}}}.\n$$\n\nThe distinction between the mixture-averaged and full multicomponent diffusion closures enters through $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Let $D_{ij}$ denote the binary diffusion coefficient between species $i$ and $j$ (units of $\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$), and let $X_i$ and $Y_i$ denote the mole and mass fractions, respectively. Let $M_i$ denote the molar mass of species $i$ (units of $\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{mol}$). In the leading edge of a premixed flame, composition gradients are predominantly driven by the fuel $F$ consumption, so we model $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ using the fuel’s transport properties.

Mixture-averaged diffusion closure: Define the mixture-averaged diffusion coefficient for the fuel,\n$$\nD_{F,m} = \\frac{1 - Y_F}{\\sum_{j\\neq F} \\frac{X_j}{D_{Fj}}},\n$$\nand approximate the effective scalar diffusivity by $D_{\\mathrm{eff,MA}} = D_{F,m}$.\n\n2. Full multicomponent diffusion closure: From the Stefan–Maxwell relations under the assumption that only the fuel has a significant gradient in the preheat zone, the effective multicomponent fuel diffusivity is\n$$\nD_{F,\\mathrm{MC}} = \\left(\\sum_{j\\neq F} \\frac{X_j}{D_{Fj}}\\right)^{-1},\n$$\nand approximate the effective scalar diffusivity by $D_{\\mathrm{eff,MC}} = D_{F,\\mathrm{MC}}$.\n\nFor all cases, compute mass fractions from specified mole fractions and molar masses using\n$$\nY_i = \\frac{X_i M_i}{\\sum_{k} X_k M_k}.\n$$\n\nUsing identical chemistry and thermal transport (the same $k_{\\mathrm{lin}}$) for both closures, compute the laminar wave speeds\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{MA}} = 2\\,\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{eff,MA}}\\,k_{\\mathrm{lin}}}, \\quad S_{\\mathrm{MC}} = 2\\,\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{eff,MC}}\\,k_{\\mathrm{lin}}},\n$$\nand the ratio $R = S_{\\mathrm{MC}}/S_{\\mathrm{MA}}$ for the test suite below.

The physical interpretation is that for a light fuel like $\\mathrm{H_2}$, the mass fraction $Y_F$ is very small even at significant mole fractions, so the difference between mixture-averaged and multicomponent diffusivities (and thus speeds) is minimal ($R \\approx 1$). For a heavier fuel like $\\mathrm{CH_4}$, $Y_F$ is larger, making the correction factor $(1 - Y_F)$ more significant and leading to a larger discrepancy between the two models.",
