            "problem": "Consider a steady one-dimensional counterflow diffusion flame in the Burke–Schumann limit (infinitely fast chemistry) with equal and unity Lewis numbers, constant density, and constant specific heat. Introduce the mixture fraction $Z \\in [0,1]$ as a conserved scalar that is $Z=1$ in the fuel stream and $Z=0$ in the oxidizer stream. The fuel stream contains only fuel with mass fraction $Y_{F,0}$ and the oxidizer stream contains only oxidizer with mass fraction $Y_{O_2,0}$; each stream is otherwise inert. The single-step reaction is $F + s\\,O_2 \\to P$, where $s$ is the stoichiometric oxidizer-to-fuel mass ratio. Assume the flow is adiabatic and that the Lower Heating Value (LHV) $q$ is the heat released per unit mass of fuel consumed, and that the specific heat at constant pressure $c_p$ is spatially uniform. The flame reduces to a reaction sheet located at $Z=Z_{st}$ such that the stoichiometric mixing condition holds. On either side of the sheet, species evolve by pure mixing (no reaction source), and the enthalpy exhibits a discontinuity across the sheet due to the chemical heat release.\n\nStarting from the governing principle that, under the stated assumptions, any conserved scalar satisfies the same linear transport operator as $Z$, derive the following:\n\n1. The piecewise solutions $Y_F(Z)$ and $Y_{O_2}(Z)$ for the fuel and oxidizer mass fractions on their respective sides of the sheet, consistent with pure mixing, the boundary conditions at $Z=1$ and $Z=0$, and the consumption of the reactant at $Z=Z_{st}$.\n\n2.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is derived in three parts as requested, followed by a numerical evaluation.\n\n**1. Piecewise solutions for $Y_F(Z)$ and $Y_{O_2}(Z)$**\n\nIn the Burke-Schumann limit, the reaction is confined to an infinitesimally thin sheet at $Z=Z_{st}$. Away from the sheet, there are no chemical reactions, and the species mass fractions are governed by pure mixing. As conserved scalars in their respective domains, their profiles must be linear with respect to the mixture fraction, $Z$.\n\nFor the fuel mass fraction, $Y_F$, fuel exists only on the fuel-rich side of the flame ($Z > Z_{st}$). The boundary conditions are:\n1.  At the fuel stream inlet, $Y_F(Z=1) = Y_{F,0}$.\n2.  At the flame sheet, fuel is completely consumed, so $Y_F(Z=Z_{st}) = 0$.\n\nWe assume a linear profile $Y_F(Z) = aZ+b$. Applying the boundary conditions:\n$a(1) + b = Y_{F,0}$\n$aZ_{st} + b = 0 \\implies b = -aZ_{st}$\nSubstituting $b$ into the first equation: $a(1-Z_{st}) = Y_{F,0} \\implies a = \\frac{Y_{F,0}}{1-Z_{st}}$.\nThus, $b = -\\frac{Y_{F,0}Z_{st}}{1-Z_{st}}$.\nThe fuel mass fraction profile is:\n$Y_F(Z) = \\frac{Y_{F,0}}{1-Z_{st}}Z - \\frac{Y_{F,0}Z_{st}}{1-Z_{st}} = Y_{F,0}\\frac{Z-Z_{st}}{1-Z_{st}}$ for $Z \\ge Z_{st}$.\nFor $Z  Z_{st}$, $Y_F(Z)=0$.\n\nFor the oxidizer mass fraction, $Y_{O_2}$, oxidizer exists only on the fuel-lean side ($Z  Z_{st}$). The boundary conditions are:\n1.  At the oxidizer stream inlet, $Y_{O_2}(Z=0) = Y_{O_2,0}$.\n2.  At the flame sheet, oxidizer is completely consumed, so $Y_{O_2}(Z=Z_{st}) = 0$.\n\nAssuming a linear profile $Y_{O_2}(Z) = cZ+d$:\n$c(0) + d = Y_{O_2,0} \\implies d = Y_{O_2,0}$.\n$cZ_{st} + d = 0 \\implies c = -\\frac{d}{Z_{st}} = -\\frac{Y_{O_2,0}}{Z_{st}}$.\nThe oxidizer mass fraction profile is:\n$Y_{O_2}(Z) = -\\frac{Y_{O_2,0}}{Z_{st}}Z + Y_{O_2,0} = Y_{O_2,0}\\left(1-\\frac{Z}{Z_{st}}\\right)$ for $Z \\le Z_{st}$.\nFor $Z  Z_{st}$, $Y_{O_2}(Z)=0$.\n\n**2. Expression for the stoichiometric mixture fraction $Z_{st}$**\n\nAt the flame sheet, fuel and oxidizer diffuse towards the sheet and are consumed in stoichiometric proportions. This means that the rate of oxidizer mass consumed per unit area, $\\dot{m}''_{O_2}$, must be $s$ times the rate of fuel mass consumed per unit area, $\\dot{m}''_{F}$. The consumption rate is equal to the net diffusive flux into the reaction sheet.\nWith the coordinate system defined such that $Z$ (and $x$) increases from the oxidizer side to the fuel side, fuel diffuses in the $-x$ direction to the sheet, and oxidizer diffuses in the $+x$ direction to the sheet. The consumption rates are therefore:\n$$ \\dot{m}''_{F} = -j_F|_{Z_{st}^+} = - \\left(-\\rho D \\frac{dY_F}{dx}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^+}\\right) = \\rho D \\frac{dY_F}{dx}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^+} $$\n$$ \\dot{m}''_{O_2} = j_{O_2}|_{Z_{st}^-} = -\\rho D \\frac{dY_{O_2}}{dx}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^-} $$\nThe stoichiometric condition $\\dot{m}''_{O_2} = s \\dot{m}''_{F}$ becomes:\n$$ -\\rho D \\frac{dY_{O_2}}{dx}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^-} = s \\left( \\rho D \\frac{dY_F}{dx}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^+} \\right) $$\nCancelling $\\rho D$ and using the chain rule $\\frac{dY}{dx} = \\frac{dY}{dZ}\\frac{dZ}{dx}$ (and cancelling the continuous, non-zero $\\frac{dZ}{dx}$ term):\n$$ -\\frac{dY_{O_2}}{dZ}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^-} = s \\frac{dY_F}{dZ}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^+} $$\nFrom the piecewise solutions in Part 1, we find the gradients:\n$\\frac{dY_F}{dZ} = \\frac{Y_{F,0}}{1-Z_{st}}$\n$\\frac{dY_{O_2}}{dZ} = -\\frac{Y_{O_2,0}}{Z_{st}}$\nSubstituting these into the balance equation:\n$$ -\\left(-\\frac{Y_{O_2,0}}{Z_{st}}\\right) = s \\left(\\frac{Y_{F,0}}{1-Z_{st}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{Y_{O_2,0}}{Z_{st}} = s \\frac{Y_{F,0}}{1-Z_{st}} $$\n$$ Y_{O_2,0}(1-Z_{st}) = s Y_{F,0} Z_{st} $$\n$$Y_{O_2,0} - Y_{O_2,0}Z_{st} = s Y_{F,0} Z_{st}$$\n$$Y_{O_2,0} = (s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O_2,0})Z_{st}$$\nSolving for $Z_{st}$:\n$$Z_{st} = \\frac{Y_{O_2,0}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O_2,0}}$$\n\n**3. Piecewise temperature field $T(Z)$ and flame temperature $T_f^{+}$**\n\nSimilar to species, temperature exhibits a piecewise linear profile in $Z$ away from the flame sheet. Let $T_f$ be the temperature at the flame sheet, $Z=Z_{st}$. The temperature is continuous across the sheet, so $T_f = T_f^{-} = T_f^{+}$.\nFor $Z \\le Z_{st}$: $T(Z) = T_{O,0} + (T_f - T_{O,0})\\frac{Z}{Z_{st}}$.\nFor $Z \\ge Z_{st}$: $T(Z) = T_f + (T_{F,0} - T_f)\\frac{Z-Z_{st}}{1-Z_{st}}$.\n\nAn energy balance across the flame sheet equates the net conduction of heat away from the flame to the heat generated by the reaction.\nThe divergence of heat flux equals the heat source: $\\nabla \\cdot (-\\lambda \\nabla T) = q \\dot{\\omega}_F$. Integrating across the sheet gives a jump in the heat flux:\n$$-\\lambda \\left.\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right|_{Z_{st}^+} - \\left(-\\lambda \\left.\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right|_{Z_{st}^-}\\right) = q \\dot{m}''_{F} = q \\left(\\rho D \\frac{dY_F}{dx}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^+}\\right)$$\n$$-\\lambda \\left(\\left.\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right|_{Z_{st}^+} - \\left.\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right|_{Z_{st}^-}\\right) = q \\rho D \\left.\\frac{dY_F}{dx}\\right|_{Z_{st}^+}$$\nUsing $\\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{dZ}{dx}\\frac{d}{dZ}$ and $Le = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\rho c_p D} = 1 \\implies \\lambda = \\rho D c_p$:\n$$-\\rho D c_p \\frac{dZ}{dx} \\left(\\left.\\frac{dT}{dZ}\\right|_{Z_{st}^+} - \\left.\\frac{dT}{dZ}\\right|_{Z_{st}^-}\\right) = q \\rho D \\frac{dZ}{dx} \\left.\\frac{dY_F}{dZ}\\right|_{Z_{st}^+}$$\n$$-c_p \\left(\\left.\\frac{dT}{dZ}\\right|_{Z_{st}^+} - \\left.\\frac{dT}{dZ}\\right|_{Z_{st}^-}\\right) = q \\left.\\frac{dY_F}{dZ}\\right|_{Z_{st}^+}$$\nFrom the piecewise temperature profiles, the gradients are:\n$\\left.\\frac{dT}{dZ}\\right|_{Z_{st}^+} = \\frac{T_{F,0} - T_f}{1-Z_{st}}$\n$\\left.\\frac{dT}{dZ}\\right|_{Z_{st}^-} = \\frac{T_f - T_{O,0}}{Z_{st}}$\nSubstituting these and the gradient of $Y_F$ into the energy balance:\n$$-c_p \\left( \\frac{T_{F,0} - T_f}{1-Z_{st}} - \\frac{T_f - T_{O,0}}{Z_{st}} \\right) = q \\left( \\frac{Y_{F,0}}{1-Z_{st}} \\right)$$\nMultiply by $-(1-Z_{st})$:\n$$c_p \\left( T_{F,0} - T_f - (T_f - T_{O,0}) \\frac{1-Z_{st}}{Z_{st}} \\right) = -q Y_{F,0}$$\nThis seems to have a sign issue. Let's re-examine the energy balance.\nHeat generated = $q \\dot{m}''_{F}$. Heat conducted away = heat flux out of right face - heat flux into left face = $(-k \\frac{dT}{dx}|_{Z_{st}^+}) - (-k \\frac{dT}{dx}|_{Z_{st}^-})$.\n$$ q \\rho D \\frac{dY_F}{dx}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^+} = -k \\left( \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^+} - \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^-} \\right) $$\nUsing $Le=1 \\implies k = \\rho D c_p$:\n$$ q \\frac{dY_F}{dx}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^+} = -c_p \\left( \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^+} - \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^-} \\right) $$\nDividing by $\\frac{dZ}{dx}$:\n$$ q \\frac{dY_F}{dZ}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^+} = -c_p \\left( \\frac{dT}{dZ}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^+} - \\frac{dT}{dZ}\\bigg|_{Z_{st}^-} \\right) $$\nThis matches the equation I derived just before. The original text had a sign error in the flux jump equation but I have corrected it by looking at the control volume balance. Let's re-solve from here.\n$$ q \\left(\\frac{Y_{F,0}}{1-Z_{st}}\\right) = -c_p \\left( \\frac{T_{F,0} - T_f}{1-Z_{st}} - \\frac{T_f - T_{O,0}}{Z_{st}} \\right) $$\nMultiply by $(1-Z_{st})/c_p$:\n$$ \\frac{q Y_{F,0}}{c_p} = -(T_{F,0} - T_f) + (T_f - T_{O,0})\\frac{1-Z_{st}}{Z_{st}} $$\n$$ \\frac{q Y_{F,0} Z_{st}}{c_p} = -(T_{F,0}-T_f)Z_{st} + (T_f - T_{O,0})(1-Z_{st}) $$\n$$ \\frac{q Y_{F,0} Z_{st}}{c_p} = -T_{F,0}Z_{st} + T_f Z_{st} + T_f(1-Z_{st}) - T_{O,0}(1-Z_{st}) $$\n$$ \\frac{q Y_{F,0} Z_{st}}{c_p} = -T_{F,0}Z_{st} + T_f - T_{O,0}(1-Z_{st}) $$\nSolving for $T_f$:\n$$ T_f = T_{F,0} Z_{st} + T_{O,0}(1-Z_{st}) + \\frac{q Y_{F,0} Z_{st}}{c_p} $$\nThis is the correct result and matches what the original text had in its final equation for $T_f$. The derivation in the original text had several sign errors that fortuitously cancelled. I have fixed the derivation.\nThe problem asks for $T_f^{+}$, which is equal to $T_f$. Substituting the expression for $Z_{st}$ yields the closed-form solution:\n$$T_f^{+} = T_f = T_{F,0} \\left( \\frac{Y_{O_2,0}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O_2,0}} \\right) + T_{O,0} \\left( \\frac{s Y_{F,0}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O_2,0}} \\right) + \\frac{q Y_{F,0}}{c_p} \\left( \\frac{Y_{O_2,0}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O_2,0}} \\right)$$\n$$T_f^{+} = \\frac{T_{F,0} Y_{O_2,0} + T_{O,0} s Y_{F,0}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O_2,0}} + \\frac{q Y_{F,0} Y_{O_2,0}}{c_p (s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O_2,0})}$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the stoichiometric mixture fraction $Z_{st}$:\n$$Z_{st} = \\frac{Y_{O_2,0}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O_2,0}} = \\frac{0.21}{4(1.0) + 0.21} = \\frac{0.21}{4.21}$$\nNext, we calculate the characteristic chemical temperature rise:\n$$\\frac{q}{c_p} = \\frac{44 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{J/kg}}{1.1 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J/(kg\\cdot K)}} = 40 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nNow, we evaluate $T_f^{+}$ using the simpler expression for $T_f$:\n$$T_f^{+} = T_{F,0} Z_{st} + T_{O,0}(1-Z_{st}) + \\frac{q Y_{F,0}}{c_p} Z_{st}$$\n$$T_f^{+} = (300\\,\\mathrm{K})\\left(\\frac{0.21}{4.21}\\right) + (800\\,\\mathrm{K})\\left(1 - \\frac{0.21}{4.21}\\right) + (40 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{K})(1.0)\\left(\\frac{0.21}{4.21}\\right)$$\n$$T_f^{+} = (300)\\left(\\frac{0.21}{4.21}\\right) + (800)\\left(\\frac{4.0}{4.21}\\right) + (40000)\\left(\\frac{0.21}{4.21}\\right)$$\n$$T_f^{+} = \\frac{300(0.21) + 800(4.0) + 40000(0.21)}{4.21}$$\n$$T_f^{+} = \\frac{63 + 3200 + 8400}{4.21} = \\frac{11663}{4.21}\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n$$T_f^{+} \\approx 2770.3087886\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the final answer is $2770\\,\\mathrm{K}$.",

It describes a classic one-dimensional diffusion flame problem (a Burke-Schumann problem) with the added complexity of unequal species diffusivities, which is a standard topic in combustion theory. The definition of the mixture fraction $Z(x)$ as a separate passive scalar is a common modeling simplification and does not introduce a physical or logical contradiction, as it stands as a mathematical definition to be solved independently.\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts: first, the determination of the flame-sheet location $x_f$ from the species transport equations, and second, the construction of the mixture fraction field $Z(x)$ as defined in the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Flame-Sheet Location $x_f$**\n\nThe steady, one-dimensional species conservation equation without convection for a species $k$ is given by\n$$\n\\frac{dJ_k}{dx} = \\dot{\\omega}_k\n$$\nwhere $J_k$ is the diffusive mass flux and $\\dot{\\omega}_k$ is the mass production/consumption rate per unit volume.

            "introduction": "While idealized models assume adiabatic conditions, real flames lose heat to their surroundings, a process that can lead to extinction. This advanced exercise () guides you in developing an energy balance for a non-adiabatic flame sheet to derive a criterion for radiative extinction. By balancing chemical heat release against conductive and radiative losses, you will quantify the conditions under which a flame can no longer sustain itself, a critical concept in combustion safety and design.",

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional, steady, planar diffusion flame modeled in the Burke–Schumann thin-reaction-zone limit, embedded between two parallel, large, isothermal, black plates located at positions $x=-L$ and $x=+L$. The plates are maintained at a uniform ambient temperature $T_{\\infty}$, and the gas between them is quiescent. The flame is located at $x=0$. The left plate at $x=-L$ is in contact with a fuel stream at mass fraction $Y_{F,\\infty}$ and temperature $T_{\\infty}$, and the right plate at $x=+L$ is in contact with an oxidizer stream at mass fraction $Y_{O,\\infty}$ and temperature $T_{\\infty}$. Assume the following:\n\n- The gas properties are constant: density $\\rho$, species diffusivity $D$, and thermal conductivity $k$ do not vary with temperature or composition. The specific heat at constant pressure is uniform and sufficiently large that sensible enthalpy variations away from the flame can be captured by Fourier heat conduction.\n- The chemical reaction is infinitely fast locally (Burke–Schumann) but requires that the reaction-zone (sheet) temperature reach a known critical temperature $T_{c}$ to be self-sustaining due to finite-rate chemistry effects. Below $T_{c}$, the local reaction cannot sustain itself.\n- The flame is exactly stoichiometric at $x=0$ and remains at the mid-plane by enforcing a stoichiometric supply at the boundaries, so that $Y_{O,\\infty}=s\\,Y_{F,\\infty}$, where $s$ is the stoichiometric oxidizer-to-fuel mass ratio. Under these conditions the diffusion fluxes of fuel and oxidizer to the sheet are equal on a stoichiometric basis, and the sheet remains fixed at $x=0$.\n- Transport on each side of the sheet is purely diffusive: species transport follows Fick’s law and heat transport follows Fourier’s law, with linear profiles between the sheet and each plate at steady state.\n- The heat of reaction per unit mass of fuel consumed is $\\Delta h0$ (assumed constant). The infinitesimally thin reaction sheet emits thermal radiation from both faces as a gray surface of effective emissivity $\\epsilon$ to the black plates at $T_{\\infty}$ through an optically thin, non-participating gas. The Stefan–Boltzmann constant is $\\sigma$.\n\nUsing only the fundamental balances of mass diffusion (Fick’s law), heat conduction (Fourier’s law), and thermal radiation (Stefan–Boltzmann law), derive an approximate radiative-extinction criterion by balancing the chemical heat release at the sheet with the sum of conductive and radiative heat losses evaluated at the critical sheet temperature $T_{c}$. Specifically, determine the minimum boundary fuel mass fraction $Y_{F,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{crit}}$ that allows the sheet temperature to reach $T_{c}$ and thereby avoid radiative extinction.\n\nExpress your final answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the parameters $\\rho$, $D$, $k$, $L$, $\\Delta h$, $\\epsilon$, $\\sigma$, $T_{c}$, and $T_{\\infty}$. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is needed. The answer is dimensionless and must be reported as a mass fraction. Do not introduce any additional empirical correlations beyond those stated above.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a radiative-extinction criterion for a one-dimensional, steady, planar diffusion flame. The criterion will be expressed as the minimum boundary fuel mass fraction, $Y_{F,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{crit}}$, required to sustain the flame. This is found by establishing an energy balance at the flame sheet, located at $x=0$, under the critical condition that the flame temperature, $T_f$, is equal to a specified critical temperature, $T_c$.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the energy balance per unit area at the flame sheet:\n$$ \\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{gen}} = \\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{loss}} $$\nwhere $\\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{gen}}$ is the rate of heat generation from the chemical reaction and $\\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{loss}}$ is the total rate of heat loss from the flame sheet due to conduction and radiation.\n\n**1. Heat Generation Rate ($\\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{gen}}$)**\n\nThe heat generation rate is the product of the fuel mass consumption rate per unit area, $\\dot{m}''_{F}$, and the heat of reaction per unit mass of fuel, $\\Delta h$.\n$$ \\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{gen}} = \\dot{m}''_{F} \\Delta h $$\nTo find $\\dot{m}''_{F}$, we analyze the mass transport of fuel. In the fuel-side region, $x \\in [-L, 0]$, for a steady, one-dimensional system with no bulk flow and constant properties, the species conservation equation for the fuel mass fraction, $Y_F$, simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-\\rho D \\frac{dY_F}{dx}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{d^2Y_F}{dx^2} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density and $D$ is the species diffusivity. The general solution is a linear profile: $Y_F(x) = C_1 x + C_2$.\nThe boundary conditions for fuel are:\n1.  At the left boundary, $x=-L$: $Y_F(-L) = Y_{F,\\infty}$.\n2.  At the flame sheet, $x=0$, in the Burke-Schumann limit: $Y_F(0) = 0$.\n\nApplying the second condition gives $C_2 = 0$. Applying the first condition gives $Y_F(-L) = C_1(-L) = Y_{F,\\infty}$, which yields $C_1 = -Y_{F,\\infty}/L$.\nThe fuel mass fraction profile is therefore:\n$$ Y_F(x) = -\\frac{Y_{F,\\infty}}{L} x \\quad \\text{for } x \\in [-L, 0] $$\nThe mass flux of fuel into the flame sheet from the left is given by Fick's law:\n$$ \\dot{m}''_{F} = -\\rho D \\frac{dY_F}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0^-} $$\nThe gradient is $\\frac{dY_F}{dx} = -Y_{F,\\infty}/L$. Substituting this into the flux expression:\n$$ \\dot{m}''_{F} = -\\rho D \\left(-\\frac{Y_{F,\\infty}}{L}\\right) = \\frac{\\rho D Y_{F,\\infty}}{L} $$\nThe heat generation rate per unit area is then:\n$$ \\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{gen}} = \\frac{\\rho D \\Delta h}{L} Y_{F,\\infty} $$\n\n**2. Heat Loss Rate ($\\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{loss}}$)**\n\nThe flame sheet loses heat through two mechanisms: conduction to the cold walls and radiation to the cold walls.\n$$ \\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{loss}} = \\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{cond}} + \\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{rad}} $$\n\n**2.1. Conductive Heat Loss ($\\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{cond}}$)**\nAway from the flame sheet, in the absence of heat sources, the steady-state one-dimensional heat conduction equation with constant thermal conductivity $k$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-k \\frac{dT}{dx}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = 0 $$\nThis implies the temperature profile is piecewise linear. Let the flame sheet temperature be $T(0) = T_f$. The boundary condition at both plates is $T(-L) = T(L) = T_{\\infty}$.\nFor the region $x \\in [-L, 0]$, the linear profile satisfying $T(-L)=T_{\\infty}$ and $T(0)=T_f$ is:\n$$ T(x) = \\left(\\frac{T_f - T_{\\infty}}{L}\\right)x + T_f $$\nThe heat flux conducted away from the flame towards the left plate is:\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{cond, L}} = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0^-} = -k\\left(\\frac{T_f - T_{\\infty}}{L}\\right) $$\nThis expression represents flux in the $+x$ direction. To represent loss *from* the sheet, we should consider the flux leaving the control volume. The heat conducted *away* to the left is in the $-x$ direction, so its magnitude is $k\\left(\\frac{T_f - T_{\\infty}}{L}\\right)$.\nFor the region $x \\in [0, L]$, the linear profile satisfying $T(0)=T_f$ and $T(L)=T_{\\infty}$ is:\n$$ T(x) = \\left(\\frac{T_{\\infty} - T_f}{L}\\right)x + T_f $$\nThe heat flux conducted away from the flame towards the right plate (in the $+x$ direction) is:\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{cond, R}} = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0^+} = -k\\left(\\frac{T_{\\infty} - T_f}{L}\\right) = k\\left(\\frac{T_f - T_{\\infty}}{L}\\right) $$\nThe total conductive heat loss per unit area is the sum of the magnitudes of the fluxes to the left and right:\n$$ \\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{cond}} = |q''_{\\mathrm{cond, L}}| + |q''_{\\mathrm{cond, R}}| = \\frac{k(T_f - T_{\\infty})}{L} + \\frac{k(T_f - T_{\\infty})}{L} = \\frac{2k}{L}(T_f - T_{\\infty}) $$\n\n**2.2. Radiative Heat Loss ($\\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{rad}}$)**\nThe flame sheet is modeled as a gray surface with emissivity $\\epsilon$ at temperature $T_f$. It radiates from its two faces to the surrounding black plates at temperature $T_{\\infty}$. The gas is non-participating. The net radiative heat flux from one face of the flame sheet to the corresponding plate is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a gray surface radiating to a black enclosure:\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{rad, one-face}} = \\epsilon \\sigma (T_f^4 - T_{\\infty}^4) $$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since the flame sheet has two faces, both radiating to the surroundings, the total radiative heat loss per unit area is:\n$$ \\dot{q}''_{\\mathrm{rad}} = 2 \\epsilon \\sigma (T_f^4 - T_{\\infty}^4) $$\n\n**3. Extinction Criterion**\n\nCombining the terms, the full energy balance at the flame sheet is:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho D \\Delta h}{L} Y_{F,\\infty} = \\frac{2k}{L}(T_f - T_{\\infty}) + 2 \\epsilon \\sigma (T_f^4 - T_{\\infty}^4) $$\nThe extinction condition is defined as the point where the flame temperature $T_f$ is equal to the minimum critical temperature $T_c$ required for the reaction to be self-sustaining. The corresponding fuel mass fraction at the boundary is the critical value, $Y_{F,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{crit}}$. We set $T_f = T_c$ and $Y_{F,\\infty} = Y_{F,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho D \\Delta h}{L} Y_{F,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{2k}{L}(T_c - T_{\\infty}) + 2 \\epsilon \\sigma (T_c^4 - T_{\\infty}^4) $$\nTo solve for $Y_{F,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{crit}}$, we multiply both sides by $L/(\\rho D \\Delta h)$:\n$$ Y_{F,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{L}{\\rho D \\Delta h} \\left[ \\frac{2k}{L}(T_c - T_{\\infty}) + 2 \\epsilon \\sigma (T_c^4 - T_{\\infty}^4) \\right] $$\nDistributing the factor gives:\n$$ Y_{F,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{2k(T_c - T_{\\infty})}{\\rho D \\Delta h} + \\frac{2L \\epsilon \\sigma (T_c^4 - T_{\\infty}^4)}{\\rho D \\Delta h} $$\nThis expression can be written more compactly as:\n$$ Y_{F,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{2}{\\rho D \\Delta h} \\left[ k(T_c - T_{\\infty}) + L \\epsilon \\sigma (T_c^4 - T_{\\infty}^4) \\right] $$\nThis is the final expression for the minimum boundary fuel mass fraction required to sustain the flame.",
