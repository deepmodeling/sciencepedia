The model, though simplified (e.g., thin flame sheet, linear temperature profile), is a standard and valid approach in an introductory analysis of flame structure. All principles are sound.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The core task is to solve a nonlinear algebraic equation for $T_{\\text{peak}}$. Let the energy balance be written as finding the root of the function $f(T) = 2k(T - T_{\\infty})/L + \\epsilon\\sigma(T^4 - T_{\\infty}^4) - q''_{\\text{gen}}$. The derivative of this function with respect to $T$ is $f'(T) = 2k/L + 4\\epsilon\\sigma T^3$. Since all physical parameters ($k, L, \\epsilon, \\sigma$) are non-negative and the temperature $T$ must be positive, $f'(T) > 0$ for all physically relevant conditions (specifically for $k>0$, $L>0$). This strict monotonic increase of $f(T)$ guarantees that a unique solution for $T_{\\text{peak}} > T_{\\infty}$ exists. The problem is well-posed.\n*   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, using established scientific definitions and constants. There is no subjectivity.\n*   **Completeness and Consistency**: All necessary data for each test case are provided. There are no contradictions in the setup.\n*   **Realism**: The parameters provided are in physically plausible ranges for combustion phenomena in gases.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the peak temperature, $T_{\\text{peak}}$, of a planar flame sheet by solving a nonlinear energy balance equation. The total heat generated per unit area, $q''_{\\text{gen}}$, is dissipated through two mechanisms: conduction to the cold boundaries, $q''_{\\text{cond}}$, and thermal radiation to the surroundings, $q''_{\\text{rad}}$. The governing equation is:\n$$\nq''_{\\text{gen}} = q''_{\\text{cond}} + q''_{\\text{rad}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given expressions for the heat loss terms, we obtain the equation to be solved for $T_{\\text{peak}}$:\n$$\nq''_{\\text{gen}} = 2\\,k \\,\\frac{T_{\\text{peak}} - T_{\\infty}}{L} + \\epsilon \\,\\sigma \\,\\left(T_{\\text{peak}}^{4} - T_{\\infty}^{4}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation is a nonlinear algebraic equation in $T_{\\text{peak}}$. To solve it, we can define a function $f(T_{\\text{peak}})$ whose root we seek:\n$$\nf(T_{\\text{peak}}) = 2\\,k \\,\\frac{T_{\\text{peak}} - T_{\\infty}}{L} + \\epsilon \\,\\sigma \\,\\left(T_{\\text{peak}}^{4} - T_{\\infty}^{4}\\right) - q''_{\\text{gen}} = 0\n$$\nThis equation cannot be solved analytically for $T_{\\text{peak}}$ due to the presence of both linear ($T_{\\text{peak}}$) and quartic ($T_{\\text{peak}}^4$) terms. Therefore, a numerical root-finding algorithm is required. The Newton-Raphson method is an efficient choice, given its rapid convergence for well-behaved functions. The iterative formula for Newton's method is:\n$$\nT_{i+1} = T_i - \\frac{f(T_i)}{f'(T_i)}\n$$\nwhere $T_i$ is the estimate of the root at iteration $i$, and $f'(T_{\\text{peak}})$ is the derivative of $f(T_{\\text{peak}})$ with respect to $T_{\\text{peak}}$:\n$$\nf'(T_{\\text{peak}}) = \\frac{2k}{L} + 4 \\epsilon \\sigma T_{\\text{peak}}^3\n$$\nAs established in the validation, $f'(T_{\\text{peak}})$ is always positive for the given physical constraints, ensuring that the function $f(T_{\\text{peak}})$ is monotonic and a unique root exists for $T_{\\text{peak}} > T_{\\infty}$. A suitable initial guess, $T_0$, can be derived by considering the case with no radiation ($\\epsilon=0$), which yields $T_0 = T_{\\infty} + q''_{\\text{gen}}L/(2k)$. This provides a physically relevant starting point close to the true solution.\n\nFor each test case, the following procedure is implemented:\n1.  Set the parameters $q''_{\\text{gen}}$, $\\epsilon$, $k$, $L$, and $T_{\\infty}$.\n2.  Use a numerical solver, implementing the Newton-Raphson method, to find the value of $T_{\\text{peak}}$ that satisfies $f(T_{\\text{peak}}) = 0$.\n3.  With the converged value of $T_{\\text{peak}}$, calculate the conductive and radiative heat losses using their respective formulas:\n    $$\n    q''_{\\text{cond}} = 2\\,k \\,\\frac{T_{\\text{peak}} - T_{\\infty}}{L}\n    $$\n    $$\n    q''_{\\text{rad}} = \\epsilon \\,\\sigma \\,\\left(T_{\\text{peak}}^{4} - T_{\\infty}^{4}\\right)\n    $$\n4.  Round the computed values of $T_{\\text{peak}}$, $q''_{\\text{cond}}$, and $q''_{\\text{rad}}$ to three decimal places as required.\n\n### Discussion of Results\n\nThe calculations yield the following results for the four test cases:\n*   **Case 1**: $\\left(q''_{\\text{gen}}=50000, \\epsilon=0.0, k=0.12, L=0.01, T_{\\infty}=300\\right)$\n    *   $T_{\\text{peak}} = 2383.333$ K, $q''_{\\text{cond}} = 50000.000$ W/m², $q''_{\\text{rad}} = 0.000$ W/m².\n    *   In this baseline case, $\\epsilon=0$, so there is no radiative loss. All generated heat is removed by conduction. This yields the highest possible peak temperature for the given $q''_{\\text{gen}}$, $k$, and $L$. The system is purely **conduction-dominated**.\n\n*   **Case 2**: $\\left(q''_{\\text{gen}}=50000, \\epsilon=0.3, k=0.12, L=0.01, T_{\\infty}=300\\right)$\n    *   $T_{\\text{peak}} = 2038.544$ K, $q''_{\\text{cond}} = 41725.044$ W/m², $q''_{\\text{rad}} = 8274.956$ W/m².\n    *   Introducing a moderate emissivity ($\\epsilon=0.3$) provides an additional pathway for heat loss. Consequently, the peak temperature is significantly lower than in Case 1 ($2038.544$ K vs. $2383.333$ K). Conduction is still the primary loss mechanism, accounting for approximately $83.5\\%$ of the total heat loss, but radiation is non-negligible at $16.5\\%$.\n\n*   **Case 3**: $\\left(q''_{\\text{gen}}=50000, \\epsilon=0.9, k=0.12, L=0.05, T_{\\infty}=300\\right)$\n    *   $T_{\\text{peak}} = 1530.121$ K, $q''_{\\text{cond}} = 5904.582$ W/m², $q''_{\\text{rad}} = 44095.418$ W/m².\n    *   This case is designed to favor radiation. The emissivity is high ($\\epsilon=0.9$), and the half-thickness $L$ is increased fivefold. Increasing $L$ reduces the effectiveness of conduction (since $q''_{\\text{cond}} \\propto 1/L$). As a result, radiation becomes the dominant heat loss mechanism, accounting for about $88.2\\%$ of the heat dissipation. The peak temperature is further reduced to $1530.121$ K, demonstrating the powerful cooling effect of radiation when conduction is suppressed. This is a **radiation-dominated** regime.\n\n*   **Case 4**: $\\left(q''_{\\text{gen}}=10000, \\epsilon=0.6, k=0.12, L=0.01, T_{\\infty}=300\\right)$\n    *   $T_{\\text{peak}} = 712.189$ K, $q''_{\\text{cond}} = 9892.544$ W/m², $q''_{\\text{rad}} = 107.456$ W/m².\n    *   Here, the heat generation $q''_{\\text{gen}}$ is much lower. This results in a substantially lower peak temperature ($712.189$ K). Due to the strong temperature dependence of radiation ($T^4$), its contribution becomes very small at this lower temperature, even with a relatively high emissivity of $\\epsilon=0.6$. Radiation accounts for only about $1.1\\%$ of the total heat loss. The system is once again strongly **conduction-dominated**, highlighting that the dominance of radiation requires not only high emissivity but also sufficiently high temperatures.\n\nIn summary, the interplay between conduction and radiation is governed by the parameters $\\epsilon, L, k$, and the resulting $T_{\\text{peak}}$. Radiation becomes significant at high temperatures and high emissivities. Conduction dominates at lower temperatures or when the heat path to the boundary is short (small $L$) and efficient (high $k$).",

The effective diffusivity is a weighted sum of species diffusivities:\n$$\nD_{\\text{eff}}=\\sum_{k=0}^{3}\\alpha_k\\,D_{k,m}\n$$\nwhere the species indices are $k=0$ ($\\mathrm{H_2}$), $k=1$ ($\\mathrm{O_2}$), $k=2$ ($\\mathrm{N_2}$), and $k=3$ ($\\mathrm{H_2O}$).\n\nThe problem states that the flame is a pulled front, meaning its speed $S_L$ is determined by the propagation into the unstable fresh mixture state, $c=0$. To determine this speed, we linearize the governing equation in the leading-edge region where $x\\to+\\infty$ and $c(x)\\approx 0$. In this limit, the reaction term simplifies to $R(c) \\approx r\\,c$. Since $D_{\\text{eff}}$ is constant, the governing equation becomes a linear, second-order ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients:\n$$\nD_{\\text{eff}}\\,\\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} + S_L\\,\\frac{dc}{dx} + r\\,c = 0\n$$\nWe seek solutions of the form $c(x) \\propto e^{\\lambda x}$ that satisfy the boundary condition $c(x \\to +\\infty) \\to 0$. Substituting this ansatz into the linearized equation yields the characteristic equation for the spatial decay rate $\\lambda$:\n$$\nD_{\\text{eff}}\\lambda^2 + S_L \\lambda + r = 0\n$$\nThe roots are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{-S_L \\pm \\sqrt{S_L^2 - 4 D_{\\text{eff}} r}}{2 D_{\\text{eff}}}\n$$\nFor the solution to decay as $x \\to +\\infty$ (i.e., for $c(x)$ to remain positive and approach zero), we require a real, negative root $\\lambda$. This requires the discriminant to be non-negative: $S_L^2 - 4 D_{\\text{eff}} r \\ge 0$, which implies $S_L \\ge 2\\sqrt{D_{\\text{eff}}r}$. According to KPP theory for pulled fronts, the system selects the minimum possible stable propagation speed. This minimum speed corresponds to the case where the discriminant is zero, leading to a single real root for $\\lambda$.\n$$\nS_L^2 - 4 D_{\\text{eff}} r = 0\n$$\nThis gives the eigenvalue relation for the flame speed:\n$$\nS_L = 2\\sqrt{D_{\\text{eff}}r}\n$$\nThis is the well-known Fisher speed for KPP fronts.\n\nThe next step is to find the sensitivity of the flame speed $S_L$ with respect to the diffusivity of each species $k$, $\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial D_{k,m}}$. To do this, we differentiate the expression for $S_L$ with respect to $D_{k,m}$. First, we write $S_L$ explicitly in terms of the species diffusivities:\n$$\nS_L = 2\\sqrt{r \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{3}\\alpha_j\\,D_{j,m}\\right)}\n$$\nWe use the index $j$ for the summation to avoid confusion with the specific index $k$ of differentiation. Differentiating with respect to $D_{k,m}$ using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial D_{k,m}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial D_{k,m}} \\left[ 2\\sqrt{r} \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{3}\\alpha_j\\,D_{j,m}\\right)^{1/2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial D_{k,m}} = 2\\sqrt{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{3}\\alpha_j\\,D_{j,m}\\right)^{-1/2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial D_{k,m}}\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{3}\\alpha_j\\,D_{j,m}\\right)\n$$\nThe derivative of the sum with respect to $D_{k,m}$ is simply $\\alpha_k$, since $\\frac{\\partial D_{j,m}}{\\partial D_{k,m}} = \\delta_{jk}$ (the Kronecker delta). Substituting this in and recognizing that the sum is $D_{\\text{eff}}$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial D_{k,m}} = \\sqrt{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{D_{\\text{eff}}}} \\cdot \\alpha_k\n$$\nThis yields the closed-form expression for the sensitivity:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial D_{k,m}} = \\frac{\\alpha_k \\sqrt{r}}{\\sqrt{D_{\\text{eff}}}} = \\frac{\\alpha_k \\sqrt{r}}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{j=0}^{3}\\alpha_j\\,D_{j,m}}}\n$$\nThis result is computationally convenient as it depends directly on the model-input parameters. An alternative form can be obtained by noting that $S_L = 2\\sqrt{D_{\\text{eff}}r}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial D_{k,m}} = \\alpha_k \\frac{\\sqrt{r}}{\\left(S_L / (2\\sqrt{r})\\right)} = \\frac{2 \\alpha_k r}{S_L}\n$$\nThe first form is more direct for implementation.\n\nThe algorithmic implementation is as follows:\n1. Define the constant weights $\\alpha_k$ as a NumPy array: $(\\alpha_0, \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3) = (0.55, 0.25, 0.15, 0.05)$.\n2. For each test case, given the species diffusivities $(D_{k,m})$ and the reactivity $r$:\n3. Compute the effective diffusivity $D_{\\text{eff}} = \\sum_{k=0}^{3} \\alpha_k D_{k,m}$. This is efficiently done using a vector dot product.\n4. Calculate the sensitivity for each species $k$ using the derived formula $\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial D_{k,m}} = \\frac{\\alpha_k \\sqrt{r}}{\\sqrt{D_{\\text{eff}}}}$. This can be done in a single vector operation by computing the scalar factor $\\frac{\\sqrt{r}}{\\sqrt{D_{\\text{eff}}}}$ and multiplying it by the vector of weights $\\alpha_k$.\n5. The sensitivities will all be positive since $\\alpha_k > 0$, $r > 0$, and $D_{\\text{eff}} > 0$. The magnitude of the sensitivity is the value itself.\n6. Find the index of the species with the largest sensitivity. The `numpy.argmax` function is used for this purpose, which correctly handles ties by returning the first index of the maximum value, satisfying the problem requirement.\n7. The calculated sensitivities are rounded to six decimal places.\n8. The results for each test case (the list of rounded sensitivities and the index of the maximum) are collected and formatted into the specified final output string.",

This final practice delves into the nonlinear dynamics of flame stability by introducing the concept of bifurcation analysis to identify critical extinction thresholds. By formulating and solving for the turning points in a simplified energy balance, you will computationally map the boundaries of flame existence and directly observe how a continuous change in a parameter, like heat loss, can lead to a sudden and dramatic change in system behavior .",

            "problem": "Consider a reduced, dimensionless model of a steady planar premixed flame with heat loss to parallel walls characterized by a dimensionless wall heat transfer coefficient $h_w$. The model is based on conservation of energy in a one-dimensional frame attached to the flame and activation-energy asymptotics for a single-step reaction. Let the dimensionless maximum temperature rise across the flame be denoted by $\\theta$, and assume the following:\n\n- The net chemical heat release scales as $q\\,a\\,\\exp\\!\\big(-E_a/(1+\\theta)\\big)$, where $qgt;0$ is a dimensionless heat-release scaling, $agt;0$ is a dimensionless pre-exponential factor, and $E_agt;0$ is a dimensionless activation energy parameter.\n- The heat loss to the walls is modeled by Newton’s law of cooling and scales linearly as $h_w \\theta$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, a steady solution satisfies the nonlinear algebraic energy balance\n$$\nf(\\theta;h_w) \\equiv q\\,a\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{1+\\theta}\\right) - h_w \\,\\theta = 0,\n$$\nwith unknown $\\theta \\ge 0$ and parameter $h_w \\ge 0$. A bifurcation diagram of solution branches can be constructed by varying $h_w$ and solving $f(\\theta;h_w)=0$ for $\\theta$. Turning points (folds) on the solution curve correspond to extinction thresholds and occur where the implicit function $\\theta(h_w)$ loses local invertibility, i.e., at simultaneous satisfaction of\n$$\nf(\\theta;h_w)=0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta}(\\theta;h_w)=0.\n$$\n\nStarting from the above fundamental balance and Arrhenius form, formulate and implement an algorithm to:\n- Derive the condition for turning points in terms of $\\theta$ and $E_a$.\n- Compute the turning point values of $h_w$ (if any) for given $(E_a,a,q)$.\n- For completeness of construction, the algorithm should also be able to numerically solve $f(\\theta;h_w)=0$ for a set of $h_w$ values across a specified range to demonstrate the existence of branches, even though the final outputs requested are only the turning point values. The numerical branch construction should rely on robust root-finding for $\\theta \\ge 0$ for each $h_w$.\n\nAll quantities in this problem are dimensionless. Your program must implement the derivation-based formulas and numerical checks and produce turning point values of $h_w$ for each test case specified below. If no turning points exist for a test case, your program must return an empty list for that case. If a degenerate turning point exists (coincident folds), return the single corresponding $h_w$ value.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Case 1 (general multi-fold case): $(E_a,a,q) = (10.0, 1.0, 1.0)$.\n- Case 2 (degenerate fold boundary): $(E_a,a,q) = (4.0, 1.0, 1.0)$.\n- Case 3 (no folds): $(E_a,a,q) = (3.0, 1.0, 1.0)$.\n\nRequired Final Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each element corresponding to a test case should itself be a list of floating-point turning point values for $h_w$ in ascending order.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in combustion theory, mathematically well-posed, and presented with objective, formal precision. All necessary data and definitions for solving the problem are provided, and there are no internal contradictions.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of turning points (folds) in the solution diagram of a dimensionless energy balance equation for a steady planar premixed flame. These turning points correspond to flame extinction limits.\n\nThe governing nonlinear algebraic equation is given as:\n$$\nf(\\theta;h_w) \\equiv q\\,a\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{1+\\theta}\\right) - h_w \\,\\theta = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\theta \\ge 0$ is the dimensionless temperature rise and $h_w \\ge 0$ is the dimensionless wall heat transfer coefficient. The parameters $q$, $a$, and $E_a$ are positive constants representing heat release, a pre-exponential factor, and activation energy, respectively.\n\nTurning points on the solution curve of $\\theta$ versus $h_w$ occur where the solution function $\\theta(h_w)$ is not locally invertible. This condition is met when the derivative of $f$ with respect to $\\theta$ is also zero. Thus, we must solve the following system of two equations for $\\theta$ and $h_w$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nf(\\theta;h_w) = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta}(\\theta;h_w) = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\left[ q\\,a\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{1+\\theta}\\right) - h_w \\,\\theta \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} = q\\,a\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{1+\\theta}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{1+\\theta}\\right) - h_w\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, the derivative of the term in the exponent is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{1+\\theta}\\right) = -E_a(-1)(1+\\theta)^{-2} = \\frac{E_a}{(1+\\theta)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} = q\\,a\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{1+\\theta}\\right) \\frac{E_a}{(1+\\theta)^2} - h_w\n$$\nThe system of equations for the turning points is therefore:\n1. $q\\,a\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{1+\\theta}\\right) - h_w \\,\\theta = 0$\n2. $q\\,a\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{1+\\theta}\\right) \\frac{E_a}{(1+\\theta)^2} - h_w = 0$\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express the heat generation term as:\n$$\nq\\,a\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{1+\\theta}\\right) = h_w \\,\\theta\n$$\nThis assumes $\\theta \\ne 0$. If $\\theta=0$, the first equation gives $qa\\exp(-E_a)=0$, which is impossible for $q,a0$. So $\\theta0$ at any non-trivial steady state.\nNow, we substitute this expression into equation (2):\n$$\n(h_w \\,\\theta) \\frac{E_a}{(1+\\theta)^2} - h_w = 0\n$$\nThe turning points correspond to physical extinction phenomena where $h_w  0$. Therefore, we can divide by $h_w$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta E_a}{(1+\\theta)^2} - 1 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\theta E_a = (1+\\theta)^2\n$$\nThis gives a condition on the temperature $\\theta$ at the turning points that is independent of $q$, $a$, and $h_w$. Expanding and rearranging this into a standard quadratic equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta E_a = 1 + 2\\theta + \\theta^2\n$$\n$$\n\\theta^2 + (2-E_a)\\theta + 1 = 0\n$$\nThe solutions for $\\theta$ at the turning points, which we denote $\\theta_{tp}$, are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\theta_{tp} = \\frac{-(2-E_a) \\pm \\sqrt{(2-E_a)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_{tp} = \\frac{E_a - 2 \\pm \\sqrt{E_a^2 - 4E_a + 4 - 4}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_{tp} = \\frac{E_a - 2 \\pm \\sqrt{E_a(E_a - 4)}}{2}\n$$\nFor real solutions for $\\theta_{tp}$ to exist, the discriminant $\\Delta = E_a(E_a - 4)$ must be non-negative. Since $E_a  0$, this implies the condition $E_a \\ge 4$.\n\nWe analyze the existence of turning points based on the value of $E_a$:\n- If $E_a  4$: The discriminant is negative ($\\Delta  0$). There are no real solutions for $\\theta_{tp}$, and thus no turning points. The relationship between heat generation and heat loss is monotonic.\n- If $E_a = 4$: The discriminant is zero ($\\Delta = 0$). There is exactly one real solution for $\\theta_{tp}$, corresponding to a degenerate turning point (a cusp bifurcation). The solution is $\\theta_{tp} = \\frac{4-2}{2} = 1$.\n- If $E_a  4$: The discriminant is positive ($\\Delta  0$). There are two distinct real solutions for $\\theta_{tp}$. The product of the roots is $1$ and their sum is $E_a - 2$. Since $E_a  4$, the sum is positive, which implies both roots are positive and therefore physically meaningful. These two values of $\\theta$ correspond to the two turning points (ignition and extinction).\n\nOnce the values of $\\theta_{tp}$ are found, the corresponding wall heat transfer coefficients, $h_{w,tp}$, can be calculated. From equation (2) at the turning point:\n$$\nh_{w,tp} = q\\,a\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{1+\\theta_{tp}}\\right) \\frac{E_a}{(1+\\theta_{tp})^2}\n$$\nUsing the condition $\\frac{E_a}{(1+\\theta_{tp})^2} = \\frac{1}{\\theta_{tp}}$, we can simplify the expression for $h_{w,tp}$:\n$$\nh_{w,tp} = \\frac{q\\,a}{\\theta_{tp}}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{1+\\theta_{tp}}\\right)\n$$\nThis simplified formula is used for computation.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case $(E_a,a,q)$ is as follows:\n1. Evaluate the condition $E_a \\ge 4$.\n2. If $E_a  4$, there are no turning points. The result is an empty list.\n3. If $E_a = 4$, calculate the single root $\\theta_{tp} = 1$. Compute the corresponding single value of $h_{w,tp}$.\n4. If $E_a  4$, calculate the two roots $\\theta_{tp,1}$ and $\\theta_{tp,2}$ using the quadratic formula. For each root, compute the corresponding $h_{w,tp}$ value. Return the two values sorted in ascending order.\nThis procedure directly implements the analytical results derived from the problem's fundamental equations.",
