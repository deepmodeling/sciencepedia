            "solution": "The analysis of the problem is divided into two parts as requested: first, a derivation showing the conservation of total enthalpy across the flame, and second, the calculation of the final burned gas temperature, $T_b$.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Enthalpy Conservation\n\nWe consider a control volume enclosing the one-dimensional, steady, planar flame. The inlet of the control volume is in the unburned mixture (state $u$) and the outlet is in the burned products (state $b$). The First Law of Thermodynamics for a steady-state, steady-flow process is:\n$$\n\\dot{Q}_{cv} - \\dot{W}_{cv} = \\sum_{\\text{out}} \\dot{m}_{\\text{out}} \\left(h + \\frac{1}{2}V^2 + gz\\right)_{\\text{out}} - \\sum_{\\text{in}} \\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} \\left(h + \\frac{1}{2}V^2 + gz\\right)_{\\text{in}}\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{Q}_{cv}$ is the rate of heat transfer into the control volume, $\\dot{W}_{cv}$ is the rate of work done by the control volume (shaft work), $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate, $h$ is the specific enthalpy, $V$ is the velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $z$ is the elevation.\n\nFor a one-dimensional flow, the conservation of mass requires $\\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} = \\dot{m}_{\\text{out}} = \\dot{m}$. The energy equation can then be written per unit mass:\n$$\nq - w = (h_b - h_u) + \\frac{1}{2}(V_b^2 - V_u^2) + g(z_b - z_u)\n$$\nwhere $q = \\dot{Q}_{cv}/\\dot{m}$ and $w = \\dot{W}_{cv}/\\dot{m}$.\n\nThe problem states several conditions which simplify this equation:\n1.  The flame is adiabatic, so there is no heat transfer to the surroundings: $q = 0$.\n2.  There is no external work, which in this context means no shaft work: $w = 0$.\n3.  For a low-speed combustion wave such as a laminar flame, the change in kinetic energy is negligible compared to the enormous change in chemical enthalpy. Thus, we assume $\\frac{1}{2}(V_b^2 - V_u^2) \\approx 0$.\n4.  Similarly, the change in potential energy is assumed to be zero or negligible: $g(z_b - z_u) = 0$.\n\nApplying these conditions to the energy equation yields:\n$$\n0 - 0 = (h_b - h_u) + 0 + 0\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nh_u = h_b\n$$\nThis result states that the specific enthalpy of the mixture is conserved across the flame.\n\nThe specific enthalpy $h$ of a mixture is the sum of the specific enthalpies of its constituent species, weighted by their mass fractions. For any single species, the specific enthalpy at a temperature $T$ can be expressed as the sum of its standard specific enthalpy of formation at a reference temperature $T_{\\text{ref}}$ (the chemical enthalpy), denoted $h_f^0$, and its sensible enthalpy change from $T_{\\text{ref}}$ to $T$:\n$$\nh(T) = h_f^0 + h_{\\text{sens}}(T) = h_f^0 + \\int_{T_{\\text{ref}}}^T c_p(T') dT'\n$$\nwhere $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure.\nTherefore, the conservation law $h_u = h_b$ directly shows that the sum of the sensible enthalpy and the chemical (formation) enthalpy per unit mass is conserved across the flame. This completes the required derivation.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Burned Temperature $T_b$\n\nFrom the conservation of enthalpy, $h_u = h_b$, we can write the energy balance for the mixture:\n$$\nh_{\\text{mixture}, u}(T_u) = h_{\\text{mixture}, b}(T_b)\n$$\nExpanding this using the definition of enthalpy, where $(h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}}$ is the mass-weighted enthalpy of formation of the mixture:\n$$\n(h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, u} + \\int_{T_{\\text{ref}}}^{T_u} c_{p,u}(T') dT' = (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, b} + \\int_{T_{\\text{ref}}}^{T_b} c_{p,b}(T') dT'\n$$\nThe problem states that the specific heats of the unburned mixture, $c_{p,u}$, and the burned mixture, $c_{p,b}$, can be taken as constant. The integrals simplify:\n$$\n(h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, u} + c_{p,u}(T_u - T_{\\text{ref}}) = (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, b} + c_{p,b}(T_b - T_{\\text{ref}})\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the burned gas temperature $T_b$:\n$$\nc_{p,b}(T_b - T_{\\text{ref}}) = \\left[ (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, u} - (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, b} \\right] + c_{p,u}(T_u - T_{\\text{ref}})\n$$\nThe term $\\left[ (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, u} - (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, b} \\right]$ represents the heat released during the combustion of a unit mass of the mixture at the reference temperature $T_{\\text{ref}}$. This quantity is related to the Lower Heating Value (LHV) of the fuel, $q_L$, which is given per unit mass of fuel. The relationship is through the mass fraction of the fuel in the unburned mixture, $Y_{F,u}$:\n$$\n(h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, u} - (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, b} = Y_{F,u} \\cdot q_L\n$$\nSubstituting this into the energy balance gives:\n$$\nc_{p,b}(T_b - T_{\\text{ref}}) = Y_{F,u} \\cdot q_L + c_{p,u}(T_u - T_{\\text{ref}})\n$$\nSo, the final equation for $T_b$ is:\n$$\nT_b = T_{\\text{ref}} + \\frac{Y_{F,u} \\cdot q_L + c_{p,u}(T_u - T_{\\text{ref}})}{c_{p,b}}\n$$\nTo use this equation, we first need to calculate the fuel mass fraction $Y_{F,u}$. The stoichiometric reactant mixture is given as $1$ mole of $\\text{CH}_4$, $2$ moles of $\\text{O}_2$, and $7.52$ moles of $\\text{N}_2$. Using the provided molar masses:\n-   Mass of $\\text{CH}_4$: $m_{\\text{CH}_4} = 1\\,\\text{mol} \\times 16\\,\\text{g/mol} = 16\\,\\text{g}$.\n-   Mass of $\\text{O}_2$: $m_{\\text{O}_2} = 2\\,\\text{mol} \\times 32\\,\\text{g/mol} = 64\\,\\text{g}$.\n-   Mass of $\\text{N}_2$: $m_{\\text{N}_2} = 7.52\\,\\text{mol} \\times 28\\,\\text{g/mol} = 210.56\\,\\text{g}$.\n\nThe total mass of the unburned mixture corresponding to $1$ mole of fuel is:\n$$\nm_{\\text{mix}} = m_{\\text{CH}_4} + m_{\\text{O}_2} + m_{\\text{N}_2} = 16\\,\\text{g} + 64\\,\\text{g} + 210.56\\,\\text{g} = 290.56\\,\\text{g}\n$$\nThe fuel mass fraction is then:\n$$\nY_{F,u} = \\frac{m_{\\text{CH}_4}}{m_{\\text{mix}}} = \\frac{16\\,\\text{g}}{290.56\\,\\text{g}} = \\frac{16}{290.56}\n$$\nNow we substitute the given values into the equation for $T_b$:\n-   $Y_{F,u} = 16/290.56$\n-   $q_L = 5.00 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{J/kg}$\n-   $c_{p,u} = 1.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n-   $c_{p,b} = 1.20 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n-   $T_u = 300\\,\\text{K}$\n-   $T_{\\text{ref}} = 298\\,\\text{K}$\n\n$$\nT_b = 298\\,\\text{K} + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{16}{290.56}\\right) \\cdot (5.00 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{J/kg}) + (1.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(300\\,\\text{K} - 298\\,\\text{K})}{1.20 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nT_b = 298 + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{16 \\times 5.00 \\times 10^7}{290.56}\\right) + (1000 \\times 2)}{1200}\n$$\n$$\nT_b = 298 + \\frac{2753303.96... + 2000}{1200}\n$$\n$$\nT_b = 298 + \\frac{2755303.96...}{1200}\n$$\n$$\nT_b = 298 + 2296.0866...\n$$\n$$\nT_b = 2594.0866...\\,\\text{K}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nT_b = 2594\\,\\text{K}\n$$",

If we discretize the two second-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) on a grid with $N$ points, we obtain a system of approximately $2N$ algebraic equations for the $2N$ unknown values of temperature $T(x_i)$ and mass fraction $Y(x_i)$. To solve for the additional unknown $S_L$, we need one more equation. Furthermore, the system is singular due to translational invariance. To remove this singularity, we must introduce another equation, the phase condition, which fixes the flame's position. This leads to a system of approximately $2N+2$ equations for $2N+2$ unknowns. However, the standard approach combines these needs. By adding $S_L$ as an unknown and adding one phase condition, we arrive at a determined, non-singular system of algebraic equations that can be solved using a nonlinear solver like Newton's method. Let the vector of discretized unknowns be $\\mathbf{u} = (T_1, ..., T_N, Y_1, ..., Y_N)^T$. The discretized physical problem is a system of equations $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{u}, S_L) = \\mathbf{0}$. We augment this with a phase condition $P(\\mathbf{u}) = 0$. The full system to be solved is for the vector of unknowns $(\\mathbf{u}, S_L)$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{u}, S_L) = \\mathbf{0} \\\\\nP(\\mathbf{u}) = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nLet us evaluate each option against this framework.\n\n### Option A\n\nThis option proposes the following steps:\n1.  **Convert to a first-order system**: This is a standard technique for solving higher-order ODEs, especially with collocation-based BVP solvers. By introducing $Z_T(x) = \\dfrac{dT}{dx}$ and $Z_Y(x) = \\dfrac{dY}{dx}$, we get a system of four first-order ODEs for the state $(T, Z_T, Y, Z_Y)$.\n2.  **Augment the state**: The parameter $S_L$ is treated as an unknown by adding the trivial ODE $\\dfrac{dS_L}{dx} = 0$. This makes $S_L$ a component of the solution vector, to be solved for simultaneously with the profiles. The state vector becomes $(T(x), Z_T(x), Y(x), Z_Y(x), S_L)^T$.\n3.  **Boundary Conditions**: The four physical boundary conditions are $T(-L) = T_u$, $Y(-L) = Y_u$, $Z_T(+L) = 0$, and $Y(+L) = 0$. For a system of five first-order ODEs (including $\\dfrac{dS_L}{dx}=0$), we need five conditions to fully specify the problem.\n4.  **Normalization Condition**: The fifth condition is provided by the phase condition $T(0) - T^\\dagger = 0$, where $T^\\dagger$ is a fixed temperature strictly between the unburned temperature $T_u$ and the burned temperature $T_b$. This condition serves to \"pin\" the flame profile at a specific location ($x=0$) by fixing the temperature at that point. This effectively selects one solution from the infinite family of translated solutions. This choice does not alter the physics of the flame (i.e., its structure or speed $S_L$), it merely defines the origin of the coordinate system. Choosing $T^\\dagger$ in a region of high temperature gradient, i.e., strictly between $T_u$ and $T_b$, ensures that the pinning is well-defined and unique.\n5.  **Solving**: The resulting system of ODEs and multi-point boundary/phase conditions is discretized (e.g., by collocation or finite differences) into a large system of nonlinear algebraic equations and solved for all unknowns simultaneously.\n\nThis procedure is a textbook example of the correct way to solve a free-boundary, eigenvalue problem with translational invariance. It correctly formulates a well-posed problem for a numerical solver.\n\n**Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n### Option B\n\nThis option proposes:\n1.  **Discretization**: Discretize the second-order ODEs directly using centered Finite Differences (FD). This is a valid discretization strategy.\n2.  **$S_L$ Handling**: Treat $S_L$ as a parameter, not an augmented unknown. This suggests an outer loop would be needed to find $S_L$, which is less efficient than a fully coupled approach but not strictly incorrect on its own.\n3.  **Normalization Condition**: The crucial part is the normalization: \"rescaling the temperature unknowns so that $\\max_i T(x_i) = 1$ before each nonlinear iteration\". This has two fatal flaws. First, the maximum temperature, $T_b$, is a physical result of the energy balance. For a system with Lewis number $Le = \\dfrac{\\lambda}{\\rho c_p D} = 1$, we have $T_b = T_u + \\dfrac{q Y_u}{c_p}$. Forcing $T_b=1$ (or any other arbitrary value) imposes an unphysical constraint and alters the problem's solution. Second, this condition does not fix the translational invariance. The location of the maximum temperature, $x_{T_{max}}$, is not fixed. The flame can still drift within the domain $[-L, +L]$ without violating this condition, as the maximum temperature is achieved over a broad region in the post-flame gases. The Jacobian of the numerical system would remain singular or ill-conditioned.\n\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Option C\n\nThis option proposes using a shooting method.\n1.  **Method**: A shooting method recasts the BVP as an initial value problem (IVP). For this problem, one would guess the unknown initial conditions at $x=-L$ (the slopes $\\dfrac{dT}{dx}(-L)$ and $\\dfrac{dY}{dx}(-L)$) and the eigenvalue $S_L$, then integrate across the domain. The guessed values would be iteratively adjusted by a root-finding algorithm (like a Newton solver) to satisfy the boundary conditions at $x=+L$. While shooting methods can be used, they are notoriously unstable for stiff problems like flames, often requiring multiple shooting which is more complex.\n2.  **Normalization**: The proposed method for determining $S_L$ is \"iteratively adjust $S_L$ to match the downstream conditions\". This is how shooting works. However, the proposal for \"normalization\" is \"requiring the mass flux $\\rho S_L$ to equal a prescribed value\". The mass flux $\\rho S_L$ (and thus $S_L$) is the eigenvalue to be found. Prescribing its value a priori makes the problem overdetermined. There is, in general, no solution to the BVP for an arbitrarily chosen $S_L$. This fundamentally misunderstands the nature of an eigenvalue problem. The goal is to find the specific $S_L$ for which a solution exists, not to impose one.\n\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Option D\n\nThis option proposes:\n1.  **Formulation**: Convert to a first-order system and augment with $\\dfrac{dS_L}{dx} = 0$, which is a correct starting point, same as in option A.\n2.  **Normalization Condition**: The phase condition is proposed as an integral constraint: $\\displaystyle \\int_{-L}^{+L} \\omega(T,Y) \\, dx - C = 0$, where $C$ is a fixed constant. Let's analyze the physical meaning of this integral. By integrating the species conservation equation over the entire domain $(-\\infty, +\\infty)$, we find a physical relationship:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\nu \\, \\omega(T,Y) \\, dx = \\rho S_L Y_u\n$$\nThis shows that the total reaction rate is not an independent parameter but is directly proportional to the eigenvalue $S_L$. Therefore, fixing the integral to an arbitrary constant $C$ is equivalent to attempting to fix $S_L$. As argued for option C, this is an unphysical constraint that over-determines the problem. A phase condition must be physically neutral, serving only to fix a frame of reference. This condition attempts to set a physical quantity that is an outcome of the problem itself. While there exist valid integral phase conditions (e.g., pinning the \"center of energy release rate\" via $\\int x \\omega(T,Y) dx = 0$), the one proposed here is not valid.\n\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Summary\n\nOnly option A describes a mathematically sound and physically consistent method for formulating the laminar flame speed problem for a numerical BVP solver. It correctly treats $S_L$ as an unknown to be solved for and employs a valid phase condition ($T(0) = T^\\dagger$) that removes the unphysical translational degree of freedom without altering the flame physics.",
