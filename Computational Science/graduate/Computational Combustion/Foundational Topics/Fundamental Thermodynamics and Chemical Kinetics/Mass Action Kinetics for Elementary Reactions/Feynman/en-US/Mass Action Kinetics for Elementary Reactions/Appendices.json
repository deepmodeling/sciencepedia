There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution is derived through dimensional analysis. Let $[X]$ denote the units of a physical quantity $X$.\n\nFirst, we determine the units of the rate constant, $k$, from the mass action kinetics law:\n$$r = k \\prod_{i} C_{i}^{\\nu_{i}}$$\nExpressing this equation in terms of units:\n$$[r] = [k] \\prod_{i} [C_{i}]^{\\nu_{i}}$$\nSince the units of concentration $[C_i]$ are the same for all species $i$, namely $\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$, the product of concentration units can be written as:\n$$\\prod_{i} [C_{i}]^{\\nu_{i}} = (\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}})^{\\sum_{i} \\nu_{i}} = (\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}})^{\\nu_{\\text{tot}}}$$\nThe units of the rate of progress are given as $[r] = \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}\\,s^{-1}}$.

The units of activation energy $E_a$ are energy per mole (e.g., $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$), the units of the universal gas constant $R$ are energy per mole per kelvin ($\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$), and the units of temperature $T$ are kelvin ($\\mathrm{K}$). Thus, the units of the argument are:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}]}{[\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}][\\mathrm{K}]} = 1 \\text{ (dimensionless)}$$\nSince the exponential term is dimensionless, the units of the rate constant $k$ must be identical to the units of the pre-exponential factor $A$.\n$$[A] = [k] = (\\mathrm{mol})^{1-\\nu_{\\text{tot}}} (\\mathrm{m})^{3(\\nu_{\\text{tot}}-1)} (\\mathrm{s})^{-1}$$\nWe are asked to find the exponents $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$ for the unit expression $\\mathrm{mol}^{\\alpha}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{\\beta}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{\\gamma}$.

            "problem": "A well-mixed, isothermal, isobaric gas-phase reactor at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $p$ contains species $A$, $B$, and a bath gas $M$ at total molar concentration $[M]$ governed by the Ideal Gas Law $p=RT[M]$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant. Consider the following elementary chain mechanism consistent with mass action kinetics for elementary reactions:\n1. Initiation: $A \\xrightarrow{k_i} 2R$,\n2. Propagation: $R + B \\xrightarrow{k_p} P + R$,\n3.

Assume $[M]$ is effectively constant on the time scale of radical dynamics due to the large excess of bath gas under fixed $p$ and $T$.\n\nUsing only the law of mass action for elementary steps (rate is proportional to the product of reactant concentrations) and the Ideal Gas Law for the bath gas, reason from first principles to relate the time evolution of the radical concentration $[R]$ and the consumption rate of the reactant $B$. Treat $R$ as a short-lived intermediate and invoke the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA), defined as the assumption that $d[R]/dt \\approx 0$ once transient initiation has passed, because $R$ is produced and consumed rapidly relative to the bulk-reactant time scales.

Reaction order is the empirical dependence of an overall rate on species concentrations and can be non-integer; molecularity is the count of molecules colliding in a single elementary step and is an integer. Under QSSA for $R$ with constant $[M]$, the consumption rate of $B$ is $r_B = k_p \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k_i}{k_t [M]}}\\, [A]^{1/2}[B]$, so the observed order is one-half in $A$ and one in $B$.\n\nB.

A solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of the Rate Law\n\nThe core of the task is to find the overall consumption rate of reactant $B$, denoted as $r_B = -d[B]/dt$. This rate depends on the concentration of the radical intermediate, $[R]$. We use the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) to find an algebraic expression for $[R]$.\n\n1.  **Write the rate expression for the radical intermediate $R$.**\n    The net rate of change of the concentration of $R$, $d[R]/dt$, is the sum of its rates of production and consumption from all elementary steps.\n    -   **Step 1 (Initiation):** $A \\xrightarrow{k_i} 2R$. According to the law of mass action, the rate of this elementary reaction is $v_1 = k_i[A]$. Since two molecules of $R$ are produced for each reaction event, the rate of production of $R$ is $d[R]/dt|_{init} = +2 v_1 = 2k_i[A]$.\n    -   **Step 2 (Propagation):** $R + B \\xrightarrow{k_p} P + R$. The rate of this reaction is $v_2 = k_p[R][B]$. In this step, one molecule of $R$ is consumed and one is produced, so the net change in $[R]$ is zero: $d[R]/dt|_{prop} = -v_2 + v_2 = 0$.\n    -   **Step 3 (Termination):** $R + R + M \\xrightarrow{k_t} T$. This is a third-order elementary reaction. Its rate is $v_3 = k_t[R][R][M] = k_t[R]^2[M]$. Two molecules of $R$ are consumed per reaction event, so the rate of consumption of $R$ is $d[R]/dt|_{term} = -2 v_3 = -2k_t[R]^2[M]$.\n\n    Combining these gives the total rate of change for $[R]$:\n    $$ \\frac{d[R]}{dt} = 2k_i[A] + 0 - 2k_t[R]^2[M] $$\n\n2.  **Apply the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA).**\n    The QSSA posits that for a highly reactive, low-concentration intermediate, its rate of production is approximately equal to its rate of consumption, so $d[R]/dt \\approx 0$.\n    $$ 2k_i[A] - 2k_t[R]^2[M] \\approx 0 $$\n    $$ 2k_i[A] \\approx 2k_t[R]^2[M] $$\n\n3.  **Solve for the steady-state radical concentration, $[R]_{ss}$.**\n    $$ [R]_{ss}^2 = \\frac{2k_i[A]}{2k_t[M]} = \\frac{k_i[A]}{k_t[M]} $$\n    $$ [R]_{ss} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_i}{k_t[M]}} [A]^{1/2} $$\n\n4.  **Write the consumption rate for reactant $B$.**\n    Reactant $B$ is consumed only in the propagation step (Step 2): $R + B \\xrightarrow{k_p} P + R$.\n    The consumption rate of $B$, $r_B$, is given by the rate of this elementary step:\n    $$ r_B = -\\frac{d[B]}{dt} = k_p[R][B] $$\n\n5.  **Substitute the steady-state radical concentration into the rate law for $B$.**\n    Replace $[R]$ with the expression for $[R]_{ss}$:\n    $$ r_B = k_p [R]_{ss} [B] = k_p \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{k_i}{k_t[M]}} [A]^{1/2} \\right) [B] $$\n    $$ r_B = k_p \\sqrt{\\frac{k_i}{k_t[M]}} [A]^{1/2}[B] $$\n\n6.  **Identify the reaction orders.**\n    The derived rate law has the form $r_B = k_{obs}[A]^x[B]^y$, where $x$ and $y$ are the reaction orders.\n    -   The rate is proportional to $[A]^{1/2}$, so the reaction order with respect to $A$ is $1/2$.\n    -   The rate is proportional to $[B]^1$, so the reaction order with respect to $B$ is $1$.\n    The overall reaction order with respect to reactants $A$ and $B$ is $1/2 + 1 = 3/2$. The rate also shows an inverse square root dependence on the bath gas concentration, $[M]^{-1/2}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Reaction order is the empirical dependence of an overall rate on species concentrations and can be non-integer; molecularity is the count of molecules colliding in a single elementary step and is an integer. Under QSSA for $R$ with constant $[M]$, the consumption rate of $B$ is $r_B = k_p \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k_i}{k_t [M]}}\\, [A]^{1/2}[B]$, so the observed order is one-half in $A$ and one in $B$.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The initial sentence provides a correct and crucial distinction between reaction order and molecularity. The functional form for the consumption rate of $B$ and the identified reaction orders (one-half in $A$, one in $B$) are correct and fully consistent with the first-principles derivation using the QSSA.\n-   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Reaction order always equals the sum of stoichiometric coefficients and must match molecularity for each step; therefore the overall rate is $r_B = k_p k_i [A][B]$, independent of $[M]$, implying first order in $A$ and first order in $B$.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The premise \"Reaction order always equals the sum of stoichiometric coefficients and must match molecularity\" is fundamentally incorrect for multi-step reactions. Reaction order is an empirical result for the overall reaction; molecularity applies only to individual elementary steps. The derived rate law is also incorrect and does not follow from a proper QSSA derivation.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Reaction order must be an integer and equals molecularity; applying QSSA yields $r_B = \\dfrac{k_p k_i}{k_t}\\dfrac{[A][B]}{[M]}$, which is first order in $A$, first order in $B$, and inverse first order in $M$.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The premise \"Reaction order must be an integer\" is false, as demonstrated by our derivation of a half-order dependence. The equality with molecularity is also false for the overall reaction. The rate law presented is incorrect; it lacks the square root that arises from the second-order radical termination step.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Reaction order can differ from molecularity, but because propagation regenerates $R$, the termination step is negligible; thus $[R] \\propto [A]$ and the overall rate is $r_B = k_p [A][B]$, which is first order in $A$ and first order in $B$.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** While it correctly states that order and molecularity can differ, the reasoning is critically flawed. The termination step is essential for achieving a steady state; without it, the radical concentration would increase without bound. Asserting it is negligible is a fundamental misunderstanding of chain reactions. Consequently, the derived proportionality $([R] \\propto [A])$ and the final rate law are incorrect.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**",

            "solution": "The problem at hand is a rigorous numerical verification of the principle of detailed balance for a set of elementary chemical reactions. This principle is a cornerstone of chemical kinetics, establishing the relationship between forward and reverse reaction rates at equilibrium. The task requires computing reverse rate constants, $k_r(T)$, from first principles using provided forward rate constant parameters and thermodynamic data for species. We will then confirm that at chemical equilibrium, the forward rate of progress, $\\omega_f$, equals the reverse rate of progress, $\\omega_r$.\n\nThe solution involves a multi-step procedure grounded in the laws of mass action and ideal-gas thermodynamics.\n\n**1. Thermodynamic Properties from NASA Polynomials**\n\nThe standard-state thermodynamic properties of each species $i$ are given in the form of NASA's seven-coefficient polynomials. These polynomials provide the dimensionless standard-state enthalpy, $\\dfrac{h_i^\\circ(T)}{R\\,T}$, and standard-state entropy, $\\dfrac{s_i^\\circ(T)}{R}$, as functions of temperature $T$. The coefficients are provided for two temperature intervals.\n\nFor a given temperature $T$, we first select the appropriate set of seven coefficients $(a_{1,i}, a_{2,i}, \\dots, a_{7,i})$. The dimensionless enthalpy and entropy are calculated as:\n$$\n\\frac{h_i^\\circ(T)}{R\\,T} = a_{1,i} + a_{2,i}\\frac{T}{2} + a_{3,i}\\frac{T^2}{3} + a_{4,i}\\frac{T^3}{4} + a_{5,i}\\frac{T^4}{5} + a_{6,i}\\frac{1}{T}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{s_i^\\circ(T)}{R} = a_{1,i}\\ln T + a_{2,i} T + a_{3,i}\\frac{T^2}{2} + a_{4,i}\\frac{T^3}{3} + a_{5,i}\\frac{T^4}{4} + a_{7,i}\n$$\nFrom these, the dimensionless standard-state Gibbs free energy for species $i$ is obtained using the fundamental thermodynamic definition $g^\\circ = h^\\circ - T s^\\circ$:\n$$\n\\frac{g_i^\\circ(T)}{R\\,T} = \\frac{h_i^\\circ(T)}{R\\,T} - \\frac{s_i^\\circ(T)}{R}\n$$\n\n**2. Reaction Equilibrium Constant, $K_c(T)$**\n\nFor a general elementary reaction $j$, written as $\\sum_i \\nu_{i,j}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{S}_i \\leftrightarrow \\sum_i \\nu_{i,j}^{\\prime\\prime} \\mathrm{S}_i$, where $\\mathrm{S}_i$ is species $i$ and $\\nu_i^{\\prime}$ and $\\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime}$ are the stoichiometric coefficients for reactants and products, the standard-state Gibbs free energy change of reaction, $\\Delta g_j^\\circ(T)$, is calculated by summing the species' Gibbs free energies, weighted by their net stoichiometric coefficients $\\nu_{i,j} = \\nu_{i,j}^{\\prime\\prime} - \\nu_{i,j}^{\\prime}$:\n$$\n\\Delta g_j^\\circ(T) = \\sum_i \\nu_{i,j} g_i^\\circ(T)\n$$\nDividing by $R\\,T$ gives the dimensionless form:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta g_j^\\circ(T)}{R\\,T} = \\sum_i \\nu_{i,j} \\frac{g_i^\\circ(T)}{R\\,T}\n$$\nThe pressure-based equilibrium constant, $K_{p,j}(T)$, is directly related to this quantity:\n$$\nK_{p,j}(T) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta g_j^\\circ(T)}{R\\,T}\\right)\n$$\nFor reactions involving ideal gases, the concentration-based equilibrium constant, $K_{c,j}(T)$, is related to $K_{p,j}(T)$ by:\n$$\nK_{c,j}(T) = K_{p,j}(T) \\left(\\frac{p^\\circ}{R\\,T}\\right)^{\\Delta \\nu_j}\n$$\nwhere $p^\\circ$ is the standard-state pressure ($101325\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$), $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $\\Delta \\nu_j = \\sum_i \\nu_{i,j}$ is the change in the number of moles of gas in the reaction. Third bodies, such as $\\mathrm{M}$, that appear on both sides of the reaction are excluded from the calculation of $\\Delta \\nu_j$.\n\n**3. Forward and Reverse Rate Constants, $k_f(T)$ and $k_r(T)$**\n\nThe forward rate constant, $k_{f,j}(T)$, is given by the modified Arrhenius expression:\n$$\nk_{f,j}(T) = A_j T^{n_j} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,j}}{R\\,T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A_j$ is the pre-exponential factor, $n_j$ is the temperature exponent, and $E_{a,j}$ is the activation energy. These parameters are provided for each forward reaction.\n\nThe principle of detailed balance requires that at equilibrium, the net rate of every elementary reaction is zero. This implies a fixed relationship between the forward rate constant $k_f$, the reverse rate constant $k_r$, and the equilibrium constant $K_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{f,j}(T)}{k_{r,j}(T)} = K_{c,j}(T)\n$$\nThis allows us to compute the reverse rate constant directly from the forward rate constant and the thermodynamically derived equilibrium constant:\n$$\nk_{r,j}(T) = \\frac{k_{f,j}(T)}{K_{c,j}(T)}\n$$\n\n**4. Verification of Detailed Balance**\n\nThe final step is to verify detailed balance. For a given reaction $j$ at specified conditions ($T$, $P$), we first calculate $k_{f,j}(T)$ and $K_{c,j}(T)$. From these, we derive $k_{r,j}(T)$. The rates of progress are given by the law of mass action:\n$$\n\\omega_{f,j} = k_{f,j}(T) \\prod_i C_i^{\\nu_{i,j}^{\\prime}}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{r,j} = k_{r,j}(T) \\prod_i C_i^{\\nu_{i,j}^{\\prime\\prime}}\n$$\nwhere $C_i$ are the molar concentrations. For reactions involving a third body $\\mathrm{M}$, its concentration $C_{\\mathrm{M}}$ is included in the rate expressions. In this problem, $C_{\\mathrm{M}}$ is taken as the total molar concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{M}} = P/(R\\,T)$.\n\nTo perform the verification, the species concentrations $\\{C_i\\}$ are chosen such that the reaction is at equilibrium. This is achieved by setting the reaction quotient, $Q_c$, equal to the equilibrium constant, $K_c$:\n$$\nQ_{c,j} = \\frac{\\prod_i C_i^{\\nu_{i,j}^{\\prime\\prime}}}{\\prod_i C_i^{\\nu_{i,j}^{\\prime}}} = K_{c,j}(T)\n$$\nBy construction, with concentrations satisfying this condition and $k_r$ defined as $k_f/K_c$, it must be that $\\omega_{f,j} = \\omega_{r,j}$. The numerical implementation must verify this identity to within a specified relative tolerance of $1 \\times 10^{-12}$.\n\nThe procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  For the given reaction $j$ and temperature $T$, compute $g_i^\\circ/RT$ for all participating species.\n2.  Compute $\\Delta g_j^\\circ/RT$ and then $K_{p,j}(T)$ and $K_{c,j}(T)$.\n3.  Compute $k_{f,j}(T)$ using the Arrhenius parameters.\n4.  Derive $k_{r,j}(T) = k_{f,j}(T) / K_{c,j}(T)$.\n5.  Using the given base concentrations, calculate the one remaining concentration that ensures $Q_{c,j} = K_{c,j}(T)$.\n6.  Calculate $\\omega_{f,j}$ and $\\omega_{r,j}$ using the full set of equilibrium concentrations.\n7.  Check if $|\\omega_{f,j} - \\omega_{r,j}| / \\omega_{f,j} \\le 1 \\times 10^{-12}$. The result is `True` if this condition holds, and `False` otherwise.\nThis verification serves as a robust check on the consistency of the thermodynamic and kinetic data and the correctness of the computational implementation.",
