A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution is derived through dimensional analysis. Let $[X]$ denote the units of a physical quantity $X$.\n\nFirst, we determine the units of the rate constant, $k$, from the mass action kinetics law:\n$$r = k \\prod_{i} C_{i}^{\\nu_{i}}$$\nExpressing this equation in terms of units:\n$$[r] = [k] \\prod_{i} [C_{i}]^{\\nu_{i}}$$\nSince the units of concentration $[C_i]$ are the same for all species $i$, namely $\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$, the product of concentration units can be written as:\n$$\\prod_{i} [C_{i}]^{\\nu_{i}} = (\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}})^{\\sum_{i} \\nu_{i}} = (\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}})^{\\nu_{\\text{tot}}}$$\nThe units of the rate of progress are given as $[r] = \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}\\,s^{-1}}$.

Thus, the units of the argument are:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}]}{[\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}][\\mathrm{K}]} = 1 \\text{ (dimensionless)}$$\nSince the exponential term is dimensionless, the units of the rate constant $k$ must be identical to the units of the pre-exponential factor $A$.\n$$[A] = [k] = (\\mathrm{mol})^{1-\\nu_{\\text{tot}}} (\\mathrm{m})^{3(\\nu_{\\text{tot}}-1)} (\\mathrm{s})^{-1}$$\nWe are asked to find the exponents $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$ for the unit expression $\\mathrm{mol}^{\\alpha}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{\\beta}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{\\gamma}$.

The quantity $E_a/R$ has units of temperature and can be interpreted as a characteristic temperature of the activation barrier, $T_a = E_a/R \\approx 10223\\,\\mathrm{K}$. This value is much larger than the operating temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$. When $E_a \\gg RT$, the reaction rate is extremely sensitive to changes in temperature. This is because the term $\\exp(-E_a/RT)$, known as the Boltzmann factor, represents the fraction of molecular collisions with energy sufficient to overcome the activation barrier. For a high barrier ($T_a \\gg T$), this fraction is very small. However, as temperature increases, this fraction grows exponentially.\n\nIn this case, the temperature increases by a factor of $1.5$ (from $1000\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $1500\\,\\mathrm{K}$). The power-law pre-factor $(T_2/T_1)^n = (1.5)^{0.5}$ only accounts for a factor of $\\approx 1.22$ increase in the rate coefficient. The remaining, much larger increase (a factor of $\\approx 30.2$) comes from the exponential term, reflecting the substantial growth in the population of high-energy molecules capable of reacting as the temperature rises. Therefore, the large magnitude of the ratio $\\frac{k(T_2)}{k(T_1)}$ is a direct consequence of the activation energy being high relative to the available thermal energy ($k_B T$, or $RT$ on a molar basis) in the given temperature range.",

Consider the following elementary chain mechanism consistent with mass action kinetics for elementary reactions:\n1. Initiation: $A \\xrightarrow{k_i} 2R$,\n2. Propagation: $R + B \\xrightarrow{k_p} P + R$,\n3.

Assume $[M]$ is effectively constant on the time scale of radical dynamics due to the large excess of bath gas under fixed $p$ and $T$.\n\nUsing only the law of mass action for elementary steps (rate is proportional to the product of reactant concentrations) and the Ideal Gas Law for the bath gas, reason from first principles to relate the time evolution of the radical concentration $[R]$ and the consumption rate of the reactant $B$. Treat $R$ as a short-lived intermediate and invoke the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA), defined as the assumption that $d[R]/dt \\approx 0$ once transient initiation has passed, because $R$ is produced and consumed rapidly relative to the bulk-reactant time scales. Under these conditions, determine the dependence of the consumption rate of $B$ on the concentrations of $A$, $B$, and $M$, and identify the observed overall reaction order with respect to $A$ and $B$.\n\nSelect the option that correctly distinguishes reaction order from molecularity and provides the correct functional form for the overall rate of consumption of $B$ and its implied orders:\n\nA. Reaction order is the empirical dependence of an overall rate on species concentrations and can be non-integer; molecularity is the count of molecules colliding in a single elementary step and is an integer. Under QSSA for $R$ with constant $[M]$, the consumption rate of $B$ is $r_B = k_p \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k_i}{k_t [M]}}\\, [A]^{1/2}[B]$, so the observed order is one-half in $A$ and one in $B$.\n\nB. Reaction order always equals the sum of stoichiometric coefficients and must match molecularity for each step; therefore the overall rate is $r_B = k_p k_i [A][B]$, independent of $[M]$, implying first order in $A$ and first order in $B$.\n\nC. Reaction order must be an integer and equals molecularity; applying QSSA yields $r_B = \\dfrac{k_p k_i}{k_t}\\dfrac{[A][B]}{[M]}$, which is first order in $A$, first order in $B$, and inverse first order in $M$.\n\nD. Reaction order can differ from molecularity, but because propagation regenerates $R$, the termination step is negligible; thus $[R] \\propto [A]$ and the overall rate is $r_B = k_p [A][B]$, which is first order in $A$ and first order in $B$.",

According to the law of mass action, the rate of this elementary reaction is $v_1 = k_i[A]$. Since two molecules of $R$ are produced for each reaction event, the rate of production of $R$ is $d[R]/dt|_{init} = +2 v_1 = 2k_i[A]$.\n    -   **Step 2 (Propagation):** $R + B \\xrightarrow{k_p} P + R$. The rate of this reaction is $v_2 = k_p[R][B]$. In this step, one molecule of $R$ is consumed and one is produced, so the net change in $[R]$ is zero: $d[R]/dt|_{prop} = -v_2 + v_2 = 0$.\n    -   **Step 3 (Termination):** $R + R + M \\xrightarrow{k_t} T$. This is a third-order elementary reaction. Its rate is $v_3 = k_t[R][R][M] = k_t[R]^2[M]$. Two molecules of $R$ are consumed per reaction event, so the rate of consumption of $R$ is $d[R]/dt|_{term} = -2 v_3 = -2k_t[R]^2[M]$.\n\n    Combining these gives the total rate of change for $[R]$:\n    $$ \\frac{d[R]}{dt} = 2k_i[A] + 0 - 2k_t[R]^2[M] $$\n\n2.  **Apply the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA).**\n    The QSSA posits that for a highly reactive, low-concentration intermediate, its rate of production is approximately equal to its rate of consumption, so $d[R]/dt \\approx 0$.\n    $$ 2k_i[A] - 2k_t[R]^2[M] \\approx 0 $$\n    $$ 2k_i[A] \\approx 2k_t[R]^2[M] $$\n\n3.  **Solve for the steady-state radical concentration, $[R]_{ss}$.**\n    $$ [R]_{ss}^2 = \\frac{2k_i[A]}{2k_t[M]} = \\frac{k_i[A]}{k_t[M]} $$\n    $$ [R]_{ss} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_i}{k_t[M]}} [A]^{1/2} $$\n\n4.  **Write the consumption rate for reactant $B$.**\n    Reactant $B$ is consumed only in the propagation step (Step 2): $R + B \\xrightarrow{k_p} P + R$.\n    The consumption rate of $B$, $r_B$, is given by the rate of this elementary step:\n    $$ r_B = -\\frac{d[B]}{dt} = k_p[R][B] $$\n\n5.  **Substitute the steady-state radical concentration into the rate law for $B$.**\n    Replace $[R]$ with the expression for $[R]_{ss}$:\n    $$ r_B = k_p [R]_{ss} [B] = k_p \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{k_i}{k_t[M]}} [A]^{1/2} \\right) [B] $$\n    $$ r_B = k_p \\sqrt{\\frac{k_i}{k_t[M]}} [A]^{1/2}[B] $$\n\n6.  **Identify the reaction orders.**\n    The derived rate law has the form $r_B = k_{obs}[A]^x[B]^y$, where $x$ and $y$ are the reaction orders.\n    -   The rate is proportional to $[A]^{1/2}$, so the reaction order with respect to $A$ is $1/2$.\n    -   The rate is proportional to $[B]^1$, so the reaction order with respect to $B$ is $1$.\n    The overall reaction order with respect to reactants $A$ and $B$ is $1/2 + 1 = 3/2$. The rate also shows an inverse square root dependence on the bath gas concentration, $[M]^{-1/2}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Reaction order is the empirical dependence of an overall rate on species concentrations and can be non-integer; molecularity is the count of molecules colliding in a single elementary step and is an integer. Under QSSA for $R$ with constant $[M]$, the consumption rate of $B$ is $r_B = k_p \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k_i}{k_t [M]}}\\, [A]^{1/2}[B]$, so the observed order is one-half in $A$ and one in $B$.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The initial sentence provides a correct and crucial distinction between reaction order (an empirical quantity for an overall reaction, can be non-integer) and molecularity (a theoretical concept for an elementary step, must be an integer). The functional form of the rate law, $r_B = k_p \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k_i}{k_t [M]}}\\, [A]^{1/2}[B]$, is consistent with the QSSA derivation. The resulting reaction orders are correctly identified as one-half in $A$ and one in $B$. This option is entirely correct.\n-   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Reaction order always equals the sum of stoichiometric coefficients and must match molecularity for each step; therefore the overall rate is $r_B = k_p k_i [A][B]$, independent of $[M]$, implying first order in $A$ and first order in $B$.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The premise \"Reaction order always equals the sum of stoichiometric coefficients and must match molecularity\" is fundamentally incorrect for multi-step reactions. Reaction order is an empirical result for the overall reaction; molecularity applies only to individual elementary steps. The derived rate law is also incorrect and does not follow from a proper QSSA derivation.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Reaction order must be an integer and equals molecularity; applying QSSA yields $r_B = \\dfrac{k_p k_i}{k_t}\\dfrac{[A][B]}{[M]}$, which is first order in $A$, first order in $B$, and inverse first order in $M$.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The premise \"Reaction order must be an integer\" is false, as demonstrated by our derivation of a half-order dependence. The equality with molecularity is also false for the overall reaction. The rate law presented is incorrect; it lacks the square root that arises from the second-order radical termination step.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Reaction order can differ from molecularity, but because propagation regenerates $R$, the termination step is negligible; thus $[R] \\propto [A]$ and the overall rate is $r_B = k_p [A][B]$, which is first order in $A$ and first order in $B$.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** While it correctly states that order and molecularity can differ, the reasoning is critically flawed. The termination step is essential for achieving a steady state; without it, the radical concentration would increase without bound. Asserting it is negligible is a fundamental misunderstanding of chain reactions. Consequently, the derived proportionality $([R] \\propto [A])$ and the final rate law are incorrect.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**",
