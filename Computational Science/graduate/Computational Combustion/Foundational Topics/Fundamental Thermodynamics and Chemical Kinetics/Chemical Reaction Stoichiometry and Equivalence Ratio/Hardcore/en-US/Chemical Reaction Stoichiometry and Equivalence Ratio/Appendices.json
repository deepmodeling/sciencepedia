For Carbon Monoxide ($\\mathrm{CO}$): The carbon must form $\\mathrm{CO_2}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}, \\mathrm{CO}} \\mathrm{O}_{2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO}_{2}\n$$\nBalancing the oxygen atoms: $1 + 2\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}, \\mathrm{CO}} = 2$. Thus, the stoichiometric coefficient is $\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}, \\mathrm{CO}} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\n\nThe total stoichiometric oxygen demand, $(\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{stoich}}$, is the sum of the demands for each individual fuel component. This aggregation is valid because the oxygen demand is an extensive property.\n$$\n(\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{stoich}} = (\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{stoich, CH}_4} + (\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{stoich, H}_2} + (\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{stoich, CO}}\n$$\nEach component-wise demand is the product of its molar flow rate and its respective stoichiometric oxygen coefficient:\n$$\n(\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{stoich}} = \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}, \\mathrm{CH_4}}\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{CH}_{4}} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}, \\mathrm{H_2}}\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}, \\mathrm{CO}}\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{CO}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the molar flow rates:\n$$\n(\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{stoich}} = \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}, \\mathrm{CH_4}}\\frac{\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{CH}_{4}}}{M_{\\mathrm{CH}_{4}}} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}, \\mathrm{H_2}}\\frac{\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}}}{M_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}}} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}, \\mathrm{CO}}\\frac{\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{CO}}}{M_{\\mathrm{CO}}}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided.\nThe molar flow rates of the fuel components are:\n$$\n\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{CH}_{4}} = \\frac{0.30\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}}{0.01604\\,\\mathrm{kg/mol}} \\approx 18.70324\\,\\mathrm{mol/s}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}} = \\frac{0.04\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}}{0.002016\\,\\mathrm{kg/mol}} \\approx 19.84127\\,\\mathrm{mol/s}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{CO}} = \\frac{0.20\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}}{0.02801\\,\\mathrm{kg/mol}} \\approx 7.140307\\,\\mathrm{mol/s}\n$$\nThe total stoichiometric oxygen molar flow rate required is:\n$$\n(\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{stoich}} = (2)(18.70324) + (0.5)(19.84127) + (0.5)(7.140307)\n$$\n$$\n(\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{stoich}} \\approx 37.40648 + 9.920635 + 3.570154 \\approx 50.89727\\,\\mathrm{mol/s}\n$$\n\nThe actual molar flow rate of oxygen supplied, $(\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{actual}}$, is determined from the total molar flow rate of the oxidizer stream, $\\dot{n}_{\\text{ox}}$, and the mole fraction of $\\mathrm{O_2}$ in it, $y_{\\mathrm{O}_{2}}$.\n$$\n(\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{actual}} = \\dot{n}_{\\text{ox}} \\times y_{\\mathrm{O}_{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n(\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{actual}} = (240\\,\\mathrm{mol/s})(0.18) = 43.2\\,\\mathrm{mol/s}\n$$\n\nFinally, the equivalence ratio $\\phi$ is computed as the ratio of the stoichiometric demand to the actual supply.\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{(\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{stoich}}}{(\\dot{n}_{\\mathrm{O_2}})_{\\text{actual}}} = \\frac{50.89727\\,\\mathrm{mol/s}}{43.2\\,\\mathrm{mol/s}} \\approx 1.1781775\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $\\phi \\approx 1.178$. This indicates a fuel-rich mixture, as the oxygen supplied is less than the stoichiometric requirement.",
