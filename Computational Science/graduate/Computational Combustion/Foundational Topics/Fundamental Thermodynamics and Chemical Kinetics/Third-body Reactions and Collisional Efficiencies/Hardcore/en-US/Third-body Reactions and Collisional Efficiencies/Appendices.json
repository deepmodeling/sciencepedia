It is a standard exercise in applying the definitions of third-body efficiency in chemical kinetics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the mixture-averaged collisional efficiency, $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$, its calculation for a specific mixture, and an interpretation of its role in the reaction rate law.\n\nLet $[M_i]$ be the molar concentration of species $i$ in the gas mixture. The total molar concentration of the mixture is $[M]$, given by the sum of individual species concentrations:\n$$[M] = \\sum_i [M_i]$$\nThe problem states that the effective third-body concentration, which we denote as $[M]_{\\text{eff}}$, is the sum of the species concentrations, each weighted by its species-specific collisional efficiency, $\\alpha_i$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$[M]_{\\text{eff}} = \\sum_i \\alpha_i [M_i]$$\nThe mixture-averaged collisional efficiency, $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$, is defined as the factor that relates the effective third-body concentration to the total concentration of the mixture:\n$$[M]_{\\text{eff}} = \\alpha_{\\text{mix}} [M]$$\nTo derive the expression for $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$, we equate the two expressions for $[M]_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} [M] = \\sum_i \\alpha_i [M_i]$$\nSolving for $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$ yields:\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} = \\frac{\\sum_i \\alpha_i [M_i]}{[M]}$$\nThe problem instructs us to use the ideal-gas relation between species concentration and mole fraction. For an ideal gas mixture, the mole fraction of species $i$, $X_i$, is the ratio of the molar concentration of species $i$ to the total molar concentration of the mixture:\n$$X_i = \\frac{[M_i]}{[M]}$$\nSubstituting this relationship into the expression for $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$ gives the desired derivation:\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} = \\sum_i \\alpha_i \\left( \\frac{[M_i]}{[M]} \\right) = \\sum_i \\alpha_i X_i$$\nThis result shows that the mixture-averaged collisional efficiency is the mole-fraction-weighted average of the individual species' collisional efficiencies.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$ for the given gas mixture. The composition and efficiencies are:\n-   Nitrogen ($\\text{N}_2$): $X_{\\text{N}_2} = 0.7$, $\\alpha_{\\text{N}_2} = 1.0$\n-   Carbon Dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$): $X_{\\text{CO}_2} = 0.2$, $\\alpha_{\\text{CO}_2} = 2.0$\n-   Argon ($\\text{Ar}$): $X_{\\text{Ar}} = 0.1$, $\\alpha_{\\text{Ar}} = 0.6$\n\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} = X_{\\text{N}_2}\\alpha_{\\text{N}_2} + X_{\\text{CO}_2}\\alpha_{\\text{CO}_2} + X_{\\text{Ar}}\\alpha_{\\text{Ar}}$$\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} = (0.7)(1.0) + (0.2)(2.0) + (0.1)(0.6)$$\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} = 0.7 + 0.4 + 0.06$$\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} = 1.16$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. Therefore, we write the result as $1.160$.\n\nFinally, we address how $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$ modifies the product $k_0(T)[M]$ that appears in the low-pressure limit rate law, relative to a baseline case where all $\\alpha_i=1$.\nThe low-pressure-limit rate expression for a third-body reaction, $A \\rightarrow P$, is given by:\n$$Rate = k_0(T)[A][M]_{\\text{eff}}$$\nwhere $[A]$ is the concentration of the reactant. The temperature-dependent rate is determined by the term $k_0(T)[M]_{\\text{eff}}$.\nUsing the definition of the mixture-averaged efficiency, we can rewrite this term as:\n$$k_0(T)[M]_{\\text{eff}} = k_0(T) \\alpha_{\\text{mix}} [M]$$\nNow consider the reference case where all species have a collisional efficiency of unity, i.e., $\\alpha_i = 1$ for all $i$. In this hypothetical scenario, the mixture-averaged efficiency would be:\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{mix, ref}} = \\sum_i (1) X_i = \\sum_i X_i = 1$$\nFor this reference case, the rate-determining term becomes $k_0(T)(1)[M] = k_0(T)[M]$.\nBy comparing the actual case with the reference case, we can see the effect of $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$. The product $k_0(T)[M]$ from the reference case is modified by being multiplied by the factor $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$ to obtain the term $k_0(T)\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}[M]$ that governs the rate in the actual mixture. Thus, $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$ acts as a direct multiplicative correction factor to the product $k_0(T)[M]$. If $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} > 1$, the reaction is accelerated relative to the reference mixture; if $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}  1$, it is decelerated. In this specific problem, with $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} = 1.160$, the effective collisional rate is $16\\%$ higher than it would be in a mixture where all collider efficiencies are unity.",

Collisional inefficiency is accounted for by $[M_{\\text{eff}}] = \\sum_i \\alpha_i [i]$, where the species index $i$ runs over the collider species present.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the steady-state radical concentration $[R]_{\\text{ss}}$ satisfies\n$$\n0 = P_{\\text{prod}} - k_t [R_{\\text{ss}}]^2 [M_{\\text{eff}}] \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad [R_{\\text{ss}}] = \\sqrt{\\frac{P_{\\text{prod}}}{k_t [M_{\\text{eff}}]}}.\n$$\nWe define the ignition event to occur when $[R](t)$ reaches a threshold fraction $\\beta$ of $[R]_{\\text{ss}}$:\n$$\n[R](t_{\\text{ign}}) = \\beta \\, [R_{\\text{ss}}], \\quad 0  \\beta  1.\n$$\nThe ordinary differential equation is separable:\n$$\n\\frac{d[R]}{dt} = P_{\\text{prod}} - K [R]^2, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad K = k_t [M_{\\text{eff}}],\n$$\nand integrating from $t=0$ with $[R](0)=0$ to $t=t_{\\text{ign}}$ and $[R](t_{\\text{ign}})=\\beta [R]_{\\text{ss}}$ gives\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\beta [R_{\\text{ss}}]} \\frac{d[R]}{P_{\\text{prod}} - K [R]^2} = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{ign}}} dt.\n$$\nThe integral on the left is standard:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d[R]}{P_{\\text{prod}} - K [R]^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P_{\\text{prod}} K}} \\operatorname{arctanh}\\left( [R] \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{P_{\\text{prod}}}} \\right).\n$$\nEvaluating between the limits yields\n$$\nt_{\\text{ign}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P_{\\text{prod}} K}} \\operatorname{arctanh}\\left( \\beta \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P_{\\text{prod}} k_t [M_{\\text{eff}}]}} \\operatorname{arctanh}\\left( \\beta \\right).\n$$\nThus, the ignition delay scales as $t_{\\text{ign}} \\propto [M_{\\text{eff}}]^{-1/2}$, which means the effective collider concentration directly controls the induction time via a square-root dependence. If a default assumption $\\alpha_M = 1$ is used for all species, one computes\n$$\n[M_{\\text{eff,default}}] = \\sum_i [i] = C_{\\text{tot}},\n$$\nbecause mole fractions sum to unity, where $C_{\\text{tot}}$ is the total molar concentration. The true value is\n$$\n[M_{\\text{eff,true}}] = \\sum_i \\alpha_i [i] = C_{\\text{tot}} \\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i,\n$$\nwhere $x_i$ are mole fractions and $[i] = x_i C_{\\text{tot}}$. The ratio of the default to the true ignition delay is then\n$$\n\\frac{t_{\\text{ign,default}}}{t_{\\text{ign,true}}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{[M_{\\text{eff,true}}]}{[M_{\\text{eff,default}}]} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ C_{\\text{tot}} \\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i }{ C_{\\text{tot}} } } = \\sqrt{ \\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i }.\n$$\nThe magnitude of the relative error is\n$$\ne = \\left| \\frac{ t_{\\text{ign,default}} - t_{\\text{ign,true}} }{ t_{\\text{ign,true}} } \\right| = \\left| \\frac{ t_{\\text{ign,default}} }{ t_{\\text{ign,true}} } - 1 \\right| = \\left| \\sqrt{ \\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i } - 1 \\right|.\n$$\nThis demonstrates that using $\\alpha_M = 1$ can either underpredict or overpredict ignition delay, depending on whether $\\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i$ is less than or greater than $1$, respectively.\n\nAlgorithmic steps for each test case:\n- Compute $C_{\\text{tot}} = P/(R_u T)$ in $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$ using the Ideal Gas Law.\n- Compute $[M_{\\text{eff,true}}] = C_{\\text{tot}} \\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i$ and $[M_{\\text{eff,default}}] = C_{\\text{tot}}$.\n- Compute $K_{\\text{true}} = k_t [M_{\\text{eff,true}}]$ and $K_{\\text{default}} = k_t [M_{\\text{eff,default}}]$ in $\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n- Compute $t_{\\text{ign,true}} = \\operatorname{arctanh}(\\beta) / \\sqrt{ P_{\\text{prod}} K_{\\text{true}} }$ and $t_{\\text{ign,default}} = \\operatorname{arctanh}(\\beta) / \\sqrt{ P_{\\text{prod}} K_{\\text{default}} }$ in $\\text{s}$.\n- Compute $e = \\left| (t_{\\text{ign,default}} - t_{\\text{ign,true}})/t_{\\text{ign,true}} \\right|$ and round to six decimal places.\n\nProperties tested by the suite:\n- Case $1$ (dry hydrogen-air): $\\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i  1$, showing underprediction of ignition delay when using $\\alpha_M=1$.\n- Case $2$ (humid hydrogen-air): $\\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i > 1$ due to high $\\alpha_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$, showing overprediction of ignition delay.\n- Case $3$ (oxygen bath): $\\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i = 1$, yielding zero error, demonstrating the boundary condition.\n- Case $4$ (argon-diluted): $\\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i \\ll 1$ due to low $\\alpha_{\\text{Ar}}$, showing a large underprediction error.\n\nThe final program implements these steps and prints the list $[e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4]$ as a single line, with each value rounded to six decimal places.",
