The analysis is based on the definition of absolute stability for one-step numerical methods.\n\nA general one-step method applied to the test equation $\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\lambda y$ can be written in the form:\n$$y_{n+1} = G(z) y_n$$\nwhere $y_n$ is the numerical approximation to the solution at time $t_n$, $y_{n+1}$ is the approximation at time $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t$, $z = \\lambda \\Delta t$, and $G(z)$ is the stability function (or amplification factor) of the method. For the numerical solution to remain bounded (i.e., for the method to be absolutely stable), the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed unity:\n$$|G(z)| \\le 1$$\nThe set of all complex numbers $z$ for which this condition holds is called the region of absolute stability. The given eigenvalue is $\\lambda = -10^{6}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, which is a real and negative number. The time step $\\Delta t$ is assumed to be non-negative, $\\Delta t \\ge 0$.

This is always true because $\\lambda < 0$ and $\\Delta t \\ge 0$.\n$2.$ $-1 \\le 1 + \\lambda \\Delta t \\implies -2 \\le \\lambda \\Delta t$.\nSince $\\lambda$ is negative, we must reverse the inequality sign when dividing by $\\lambda$:\n$$\\Delta t \\le \\frac{-2}{\\lambda}$$\nThis condition defines the stability limit for the time step.

Consequently, $-\\lambda \\Delta t \\ge 0$.\nThe term inside the absolute value, $1 - \\lambda \\Delta t$, is therefore always greater than or equal to $1$. The absolute value is redundant, and the inequality becomes:\n$$1 - \\lambda \\Delta t \\ge 1$$\nThis simplifies to $-\\lambda \\Delta t \\ge 0$.

The maximum stable time step is unbounded.\n$$\\Delta t_{\\text{BE,max}} = \\infty$$\n\n**Implication for Stiff Chemical Kinetics**\n\nThe eigenvalue $\\lambda = -10^{6}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ represents a very fast chemical process with a characteristic timescale of $\\tau = 1/|\\lambda| = 10^{-6}\\ \\text{s}$.\nThe result for the forward (explicit) Euler method, $\\Delta t_{\\text{FE,max}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{s}$, shows that the time step is severely restricted by the fastest timescale in the system. To maintain stability, the numerical integration must proceed with extremely small steps, on the order of $\\tau$, even if the physical phenomena of interest evolve on much slower timescales. This makes explicit methods computationally prohibitive for stiff systems.\n\nConversely, the result for the backward (implicit) Euler method, $\\Delta t_{\\text{BE,max}} = \\infty$, shows that it is A-stable. Its stability is not constrained by the stiff eigenvalue. This allows the use of much larger time steps, limited only by the need to accurately resolve the slower dynamics of the system, not by stability. This property makes implicit methods, like backward Euler, essential and far more efficient for the numerical integration of stiff chemical kinetics systems commonly found in computational combustion.",

The eigenvalues are:\n$$ \\lambda_{1} = -k_{1} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{2} = -(k_{2} + k_{3}B + 4k_{t}R_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}) $$\nThe system is stiff when there is a large separation in the magnitudes of these eigenvalues. Typically, the radical chemistry is fast, so $|\\lambda_2| \\gg |\\lambda_1|$.\nThe full-system stiffness ratio $S_{\\mathrm{full}}$ is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the larger eigenvalue to that of the smaller one.\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{full}} = \\frac{\\max(|\\lambda_{1}|, |\\lambda_{2}|)}{\\min(|\\lambda_{1}|, |\\lambda_{2}|)} = \\frac{k_{2} + k_{3}B + 4k_{t}R_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}}{k_{1}} $$\n\n**Step 4: Stiffness-Reduction Factor**\n\nThe reduced system is obtained by substituting $R = R_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}$ into the ODE for $A$.\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = -k_{1}A $$\nThis is a scalar ODE with a single eigenvalue, $-k_{1}$. The problem defines the stiffness of this reduced system as $S_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} \\equiv 1$.\nThe stiffness-reduction factor $F$ is defined as:\n$$ F \\equiv \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{full}}}{S_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{full}}}{1} = S_{\\mathrm{full}} = \\frac{k_{2} + k_{3}B + 4k_{t}R_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}}{k_{1}} $$\n\n**Step 5: Final Expression for F**\n\nTo express $F$ solely in terms of the given parameters, we substitute the expression for $R_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}$ from Step 2 into the expression for $F$.\n$$ F = \\frac{k_{2} + k_{3}B + 4k_{t} \\left( \\frac{-(k_{2} + k_{3}B) + \\sqrt{(k_{2} + k_{3}B)^2 + 8k_{t}k_{1}A}}{4k_{t}} \\right)}{k_{1}} $$\nThe $4k_t$ term in the numerator cancels:\n$$ F = \\frac{(k_{2} + k_{3}B) + \\left( -(k_{2} + k_{3}B) + \\sqrt{(k_{2} + k_{3}B)^2 + 8k_{t}k_{1}A} \\right)}{k_{1}} $$\nThe $(k_{2} + k_{3}B)$ terms cancel:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\sqrt{(k_{2} + k_{3}B)^2 + 8k_{t}k_{1}A}}{k_{1}} $$\n\n**Analysis of Asymptotic Conditions**\n\nThe QSSA is employed to reduce stiffness and simplify the system. The validity and utility of this approximation hinge on two main aspects:\n1.  **Stiffness Reduction**: The QSSA is effective at reducing stiffness if the original system was indeed stiff. Stiffness implies a large separation of timescales, which corresponds to $|\\lambda_2| \\gg |\\lambda_1|$, or $S_{\\mathrm{full}} \\gg 1$. Since $F = S_{\\mathrm{full}}$, the condition for significant stiffness reduction is $F \\gg 1$.\n2.  **Accuracy Preservation for Slow Dynamics**: The QSSA must accurately approximate the behavior of the slow-moving species. In this specific problem, the ODE for the slow species $A$, $\\frac{dA}{dt} = -k_{1}A$, is independent of the fast species $R$. Therefore, applying the QSSA to $R$ does not introduce any approximation or change to the governing equation for $A$. The slow dynamics are preserved exactly, by construction of the problem.\n\nConsequently, the sole condition required for the QSSA to be both a valid (accurate) and useful (stiffness-reducing) approximation in this system is the condition of timescale separation. This condition is expressed as:\n$$ F \\gg 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\sqrt{(k_{2} + k_{3}B)^2 + 8k_{t}k_{1}A}}{k_{1}} \\gg 1 $$\nThis single inequality encapsulates the requirement. It can be further analyzed in two limiting cases:\n-   **Linear termination dominates**: If the linear and pseudo-first-order sinks for $R$ are much faster than the self-termination, i.e., $(k_2 + k_3 B)R \\gg 2k_t R^2$, the condition simplifies. In this limit, $F \\approx \\frac{k_2 + k_3 B}{k_1}$, and the condition becomes $\\frac{k_2 + k_3 B}{k_1} \\gg 1$.\n-   **Quadratic termination dominates**: If self-termination is the primary sink for $R$, i.e., $2k_t R^2 \\gg (k_2+k_3 B)R$, the condition simplifies. In this limit, $F \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{8k_t k_1 A}}{k_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8k_t A}{k_1}}$, and the condition becomes $\\frac{8k_t A}{k_1} \\gg 1$.\n\nIn all cases, the fundamental requirement is a large value for the stiffness-reduction factor $F$.",
