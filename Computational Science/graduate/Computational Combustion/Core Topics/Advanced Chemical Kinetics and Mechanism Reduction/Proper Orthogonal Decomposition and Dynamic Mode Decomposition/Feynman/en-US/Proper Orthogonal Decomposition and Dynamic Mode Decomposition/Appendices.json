            "problem": "Consider a reduced two-component state extracted from a compressible flow simulation in aerospace Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The state at time index $k$ is $x_{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with components $x_{k} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_{k} \\\\ u'_{k} \\end{pmatrix}$, where $c_{k}$ represents a passive scalar concentration fluctuation driven by injection and $u'_{k}$ represents the streamwise velocity fluctuation. You are given four snapshots,\n$$\nx_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix},\\quad\nx_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix},\\quad\nx_{3} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix},\\quad\nx_{4} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe sample size is $m = 4$. The passive scalar component has larger variance than the velocity component in these data, but kinetic energy is physically associated with $u'_{k}$ rather than $c_{k}$.\n\nDefine two inner products on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$:\n- The Euclidean inner product $\\langle a, b \\rangle = a^{\\top} b$.\n- The energy-weighted inner product $\\langle a, b \\rangle_{W} = a^{\\top} W b$ with $W = \\operatorname{diag}(\\alpha, 1)$ and $\\alpha = 0.01$, which downweights the passive scalar in proportion to its lack of physical relevance to kinetic energy.\n\nStarting from the definition of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) as the problem of finding directions that maximize the mean-square projection of the data subject to orthonormality in the chosen inner product, derive the leading POD mode under the Euclidean inner product and under the energy-weighted inner product.

            "solution": "The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) modes are the eigenvectors of the data's correlation matrix. The \"leading\" mode is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, as this eigenvalue represents the maximum variance (or \"energy\") captured by any single mode. We will solve this eigenvalue problem for both the standard Euclidean inner product and the specified energy-weighted inner product.\n\nFirst, assemble the data matrix $X$ by stacking the snapshots as columns:\n$$\nX = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -4 & 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**1. Euclidean Inner Product Case**\n\nFor the standard Euclidean inner product, the POD modes are the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix $C_E = \\frac{1}{m} X X^\\top$. We can ignore the scaling factor $1/m$ for finding the eigenvectors.\n$$\nX X^\\top = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -4 & 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 \\\\ -4 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4^2 + (-4)^2 + 3^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 16 + 16 + 9 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 41 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries $\\lambda_1 = 41$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. The leading eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1 = 41$. The corresponding eigenvector is the standard basis vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This vector is already normalized in the Euclidean norm.\nThus, the leading POD mode for the Euclidean inner product is:\n$$ \\phi^{\\mathrm{E}}_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**2. Energy-Weighted Inner Product Case**\n\nFor a general weighted inner product $\\langle a, b \\rangle_W = a^\\top W b$, the POD modes are the solution to a generalized eigenvalue problem. A standard way to solve this is to transform the coordinates. Let $y = W^{1/2} x$ and $\\psi = W^{1/2} \\phi$. The problem becomes finding the standard POD modes $\\psi$ for the transformed data $y_k$, which are the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix $C_y = \\frac{1}{m} Y Y^\\top$, where $Y = W^{1/2} X$.\nFirst, find $W^{1/2}$:\n$$\nW = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.01 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies W^{1/2} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{0.01} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe correlation matrix for the transformed data is $Y Y^\\top = (W^{1/2} X)(W^{1/2} X)^\\top = W^{1/2} (X X^\\top) W^{1/2}$. Using our result for $X X^\\top$:\n$$\nY Y^\\top = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 41 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4.1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.41 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are now $\\lambda'_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda'_2 = 0.41$. The leading eigenvalue is $\\lambda'_1 = 1$, and its corresponding eigenvector is $\\psi_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nTo get the POD mode $\\phi^{\\mathrm{W}}_{1}$ in the original coordinates, we transform back: $\\phi = W^{-1/2} \\psi$.\n$$\nW^{-1/2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/0.1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi^{\\mathrm{W}}_{1} = W^{-1/2} \\psi_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis mode is already normalized with respect to the $W$-norm: $(\\phi^{\\mathrm{W}}_{1})^\\top W \\phi^{\\mathrm{W}}_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.01 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1$.\nThus, the leading POD mode for the energy-weighted inner product is:\n$$ \\phi^{\\mathrm{W}}_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe leading POD mode switches from being aligned with the passive scalar concentration $c_k$ to being aligned with the velocity fluctuation $u'_k$. This reordering happens because the inner product defines what \"energy\" or \"variance\" the POD algorithm seeks to maximize.\n- In the Euclidean case, the \"energy\" is simply the sum of squares of the components. Since the variance of the first component is $41$, while the second is $1$, POD identifies the direction of the first component, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, as dominant.\n- In the weighted case, the \"energy\" is weighted by the matrix $W$. The contribution of the first component's variance is down-weighted by $\\alpha = 0.01$, resulting in a weighted variance of $41 \\times 0.01 = 0.41$. The second component's variance remains $1$. Now, the second component is more \"energetic\", so POD identifies its direction, $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, as dominant.\n\n**Implications:** For model reduction (e.g., POD-Galerkin), the choice of inner product is critical. A Euclidean inner product would build a model based on the passive scalar, ignoring the physically important kinetic energy dynamics. The weighted inner product correctly identifies the velocity fluctuation as the most important mode for modeling kinetic energy.\n\n**Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)** aims to find modes with pure frequency and growth/decay rates by approximating the system with a linear operator. If the high-variance scalar concentration has messy, multi-frequency dynamics, while the lower-variance velocity fluctuation has a clear periodic signature, the leading DMD mode would align with the velocity fluctuation. In this case, the energy-weighted POD aligns better with the expected result from DMD, providing a more consistent physical interpretation across analysis methods. Using a physically-motivated inner product ensures that POD's \"most energetic\" modes are more likely to be the \"most dynamically important\" modes.\n\nThe final requested vector is $\\left((\\phi^{\\mathrm{E}}_{1})_{1}, (\\phi^{\\mathrm{E}}_{1})_{2}, (\\phi^{\\mathrm{W}}_{1})_{1}, (\\phi^{\\mathrm{W}}_{1})_{2}\\right) = (1, 0, 0, 1)$.",
