The error associated with this approximation, known as the splitting error, arises because the mathematical operators for these parts generally do not commute. This foundational exercise  explores the ideal scenario where the operators for advection, diffusion, and reaction do commute, leading to a splitting that is exact.

            "solution": "The problem requires a two-part response: first, a theoretical derivation of the conditions under which the advection, diffusion, and reaction operators commute, and a proof of the equivalence of Strang and Lie-Trotter splitting under these conditions; second, a numerical program to validate this equivalence.\n\n**Theoretical Derivation**\n\nThe governing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\mathcal{A} c + \\mathcal{D} c + \\mathcal{R} c\n$$\non a periodic domain $x \\in [0,L]$, where $c(x,t)$ is a dimensionless scalar. The linear operators are defined with constant coefficients:\n- Advection operator: $\\mathcal{A} := -a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$\n- Diffusion operator: $\\mathcal{D} := D \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$\n- Reaction operator: $\\mathcal{R} := r I$ (where $I$ is the identity operator)\n\nWe seek the necessary and sufficient conditions for the Lie brackets of these operators to be zero. The Lie bracket is defined as $[\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{Y}] := \\mathcal{X}\\mathcal{Y} - \\mathcal{Y}\\mathcal{X}$. We test each pair by applying them to an arbitrary, sufficiently smooth test function $f(x)$.\n\n**Condition for $[\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R}]=0$:**\nThe operator $\\mathcal{R}$ corresponds to multiplication by a scalar constant $r$. Any linear operator commutes with scalar multiplication. We can show this formally:\n$$\n[\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R}] f(x) = (\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{R} - \\mathcal{R}\\mathcal{A}) f(x) = \\mathcal{A}(r f(x)) - \\mathcal{R}(\\mathcal{A} f(x))\n$$\n$$\n= \\left(-a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)(r f(x)) - r \\left(-a \\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x}\\right)\n$$\nSince $a$ and $r$ are constants, they can be factored out of the derivative:\n$$\n= -ar \\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x} + ar \\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nThis holds for any $f(x)$, so $[\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{R}]=0$. The necessary and sufficient condition is that $a$ and $r$ are constants, which is given.\n\n**Condition for $[\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{R}]=0$:**\nSimilarly, the diffusion operator $\\mathcal{D}$ commutes with scalar multiplication by $r$:\n$$\n[\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{R}] f(x) = (\\mathcal{D}\\mathcal{R} - \\mathcal{R}\\mathcal{D}) f(x) = \\mathcal{D}(r f(x)) - \\mathcal{R}(\\mathcal{D} f(x))\n$$\n$$\n= \\left(D \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\right)(r f(x)) - r \\left(D \\frac{\\partial^2 f(x)}{\\partial x^2}\\right)\n$$\nAs $D$ and $r$ are constants:\n$$\n= Dr \\frac{\\partial^2 f(x)}{\\partial x^2} - rD \\frac{\\partial^2 f(x)}{\\partial x^2} = 0\n$$\nThus, $[\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{R}]=0$. The necessary and sufficient condition is that $D$ and $r$ are constants, which is also given.\n\n**Condition for $[\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{D}]=0$:**\nWe examine the composition of the two differential operators.\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{D} f(x) = \\left(-a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right) \\left(D \\frac{\\partial^2 f(x)}{\\partial x^2}\\right) = -aD \\frac{\\partial^3 f(x)}{\\partial x^3}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}\\mathcal{A} f(x) = \\left(D \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\right) \\left(-a \\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x}\\right) = -Da \\frac{\\partial^3 f(x)}{\\partial x^3}\n$$\nThe equality $\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{D}f(x) = \\mathcal{D}\\mathcal{A}f(x)$ holds because the coefficients $a$ and $D$ are constants and can be moved past the differentiation operators, and because partial derivatives commute for sufficiently smooth functions (Clairaut's theorem). Therefore, the Lie bracket is zero:\n$$\n[\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{D}] = 0\n$$\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for this commutation is that the coefficients $a$ and $D$ are constants, independent of $x$, as specified in the problem.\n\nA more elegant demonstration uses Fourier analysis. On a periodic domain, differentiation in physical space corresponds to multiplication by $ik$ in Fourier space, where $k$ is the wavenumber. The operators acting on a Fourier mode $e^{ikx}$ become simple multipliers:\n- $\\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow \\hat{\\mathcal{A}} = -a(ik) = -iak$\n- $\\mathcal{D} \\rightarrow \\hat{\\mathcal{D}} = D(ik)^2 = -Dk^2$\n- $\\mathcal{R} \\rightarrow \\hat{\\mathcal{R}} = r$\nIn Fourier space, these operators are simply functions of $k$. Multiplication of such functions is commutative. For example, $[\\hat{\\mathcal{A}}, \\hat{\\mathcal{D}}] = (-iak)(-Dk^2) - (-Dk^2)(-iak) = iakDk^2 - iakDk^2 = 0$. Since the operators commute for every Fourier mode, they commute in general. This confirms that all pairs of operators commute.\n\n**Equivalence of Strang and Lie-Trotter Splitting**\n\nA fundamental property of the operator exponential states that if two operators $\\mathcal{X}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}$ commute (i.e., $[\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{Y}]=0$), then $e^{\\mathcal{X}}e^{\\mathcal{Y}} = e^{\\mathcal{Y}}e^{\\mathcal{X}} = e^{\\mathcal{X}+\\mathcal{Y}}$. This property extends to any number of mutually commuting operators.\n\nSince we have shown that $\\mathcal{A}$, $\\mathcal{D}$, and $\\mathcal{R}$ are mutually commutative, we can analyze the splitting operators.\n\nThe Lie-Trotter operator is $T_{\\Delta t} := e^{\\Delta t \\mathcal{A}} e^{\\Delta t \\mathcal{D}} e^{\\Delta t \\mathcal{R}}$. Because the operators in the exponents commute, we can combine them:\n$$\nT_{\\Delta t} = e^{\\Delta t \\mathcal{A} + \\Delta t \\mathcal{D} + \\Delta t \\mathcal{R}} = e^{\\Delta t (\\mathcal{A}+\\mathcal{D}+\\mathcal{R})}\n$$\nThis is precisely the exact evolution operator for the full PDE over a time step $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe Strang splitting operator is $S_{\\Delta t} := e^{\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\mathcal{A}} \\, e^{\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\mathcal{D}} \\, e^{\\Delta t \\mathcal{R}} \\, e^{\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\mathcal{D}} \\, e^{\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\mathcal{A}}$. Using commutativity, we can reorder the factors:\n$$\nS_{\\Delta t} = \\left(e^{\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\mathcal{A}} e^{\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\mathcal{A}}\\right) \\left(e^{\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\mathcal{D}} e^{\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\mathcal{D}}\\right) e^{\\Delta t \\mathcal{R}}\n$$\nCombining the exponents for each operator:\n$$\nS_{\\Delta t} = e^{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right) \\mathcal{A}} \\, e^{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right) \\mathcal{D}} \\, e^{\\Delta t \\mathcal{R}} = e^{\\Delta t \\mathcal{A}} \\, e^{\\Delta t \\mathcal{D}} \\, e^{\\Delta t \\mathcal{R}}\n$$\nThis final expression is identical to that for $T_{\\Delta t}$. Therefore, when the operators commute, both splitting schemes are equivalent and exact for any $\\Delta t > 0$:\n$$\nS_{\\Delta t} = T_{\\Delta t} = e^{\\Delta t (\\mathcal{A}+\\mathcal{D}+\\mathcal{R})}\n$$\nFor non-commuting operators, this equality does not hold; Strang splitting is generally second-order accurate in $\\Delta t$, while Lie-Trotter is first-order. The numerical implementation will validate that for the given problem, the difference between the two schemes is negligible, limited only by floating-point precision.",

By separating variables and using partial fraction decomposition, we get:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{dY}{Y(S-Y)} = \\int -k dt \\implies \\frac{1}{S} \\int \\left(\\frac{1}{Y} + \\frac{1}{S-Y}\\right) dY = -k \\int dt\n$$\nIntegrating from an initial state $(Y_0, Z_0)$ at $t=0$ to $(Y(t), Z(t))$ at time $t$, and solving for $Y(t)$, yields the closed-form solution. A numerically stable form is:\n$$\nY(t) = \\frac{S Y_0}{Z_0 e^{Skt} + Y_0}\n$$\nwhere $S = Y_0+Z_0$. The new value for $Z$ is then found from the invariant: $Z(t) = S - Y(t)$. The reaction operator $\\mathcal{R}_{\\Delta t}$ applies this exact solution map at every grid point over the time step $\\Delta t$.\n\n### Operator Splitting Integrators\nTwo splitting methods are constructed:\n$1$. **Lie–Trotter Splitting**: This is a first-order accurate method. One step of evolution from $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$ is approximated by applying the full advection step followed by the full reaction step:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(t+\\Delta t) \\approx \\mathcal{S}_{\\Delta t}^{\\text{LT}}(\\mathbf{u}(t)) = \\mathcal{R}_{\\Delta t} \\circ \\mathcal{A}_{\\Delta t} (\\mathbf{u}(t))\n$$\n$2$. **Strang Splitting**: This is a second-order accurate method that uses a symmetric composition. One step is approximated by a half-step of advection, a full step of reaction, and another half-step of advection:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(t+\\Delta t) \\approx \\mathcal{S}_{\\Delta t}^{\\text{S}}(\\mathbf{u}(t)) = \\mathcal{A}_{\\Delta t/2} \\circ \\mathcal{R}_{\\Delta t} \\circ \\mathcal{A}_{\\Delta t/2} (\\mathbf{u}(t))\n$$\n\n### Convergence Analysis\nTo determine the observed order of accuracy, $p$, we run simulations for a set of decreasing time steps $\\Delta t$. The global error at the final time $T$ is computed against a high-fidelity reference solution. The reference solution is generated using Strang splitting with a very small time step, $\\Delta t_{\\text{ref}} = 0.0003125$. The error is measured using the discrete $L^2$ norm:\n$$\nE(\\Delta t) = \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\left[ \\left( Y_j(T;\\Delta t) - Y_j^{\\mathrm{ref}}(T) \\right)^2 + \\left( Z_j(T;\\Delta t) - Z_j^{\\mathrm{ref}}(T) \\right)^2 \\right] \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nFor a method of order $p$, the error scales as $E(\\Delta t) \\propto (\\Delta t)^p$. Taking the logarithm gives a linear relationship: $\\log E(\\Delta t) \\approx \\alpha + p \\log \\Delta t$. The order $p$ is estimated as the slope of a linear least-squares fit to the data points $(\\log \\Delta t, \\log E(\\Delta t))$. This is performed for both Lie-Trotter and Strang splitting for each of the three test cases. The theoretically expected orders are $p=1$ for Lie-Trotter and $p=2$ for Strang splitting.",
