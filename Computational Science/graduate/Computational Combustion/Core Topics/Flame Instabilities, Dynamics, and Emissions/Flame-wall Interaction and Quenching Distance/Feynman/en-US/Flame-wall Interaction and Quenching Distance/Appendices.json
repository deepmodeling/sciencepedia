It describes a classic scenario in combustion theory—flame quenching at a cold wall—using a standard set of simplifying assumptions (one-dimensional, steady, constant properties, unity Lewis number, thin flame) that render the problem analytically tractable. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or violations of physical principles.\n\nThe solution proceeds by deriving a scaling law for the quenching distance, $d_{q}$, using a control-volume energy balance.\n\nWe consider a flame held stationary at a distance $d_{q}$ from an isothermal wall at temperature $T_{w}$. An unburned mixture with temperature $T_{u}$ flows toward the flame at the laminar flame speed $S_{L}$. The flame is considered a thin sheet where chemical energy is released. The critical condition for quenching occurs when the heat generated by the flame is just balanced by the heat lost by conduction to the cold wall.\n\nThe rate of energy released per unit area by the flame, $\\dot{q}_{gen}$, must be sufficient to heat the incoming reactants from their unburned temperature $T_{u}$ to the adiabatic flame temperature $T_{b}$. This flux is given by:\n$$ \\dot{q}_{gen} = \\rho S_{L} c_{p} (T_{b} - T_{u}) $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $S_{L}$ is the laminar flame speed, and $c_{p}$ is the specific heat at constant pressure.\n\nThe rate of heat loss per unit area from the flame to the wall, $\\dot{q}_{loss}$, is governed by Fourier's law of conduction. Assuming a linear temperature gradient between the flame and the wall, this flux is:\n$$ \\dot{q}_{loss} = k \\frac{T_{flame} - T_{w}}{d_{q}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity. Under the thin flame assumption, the temperature of the flame sheet itself, $T_{flame}$, can be approximated by the adiabatic flame temperature, $T_{b}$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of a closed-form expression for the quenching distance $d$ of a premixed flame near a catalytic wall, and for its numerical evaluation. The validation process confirms the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and its premises are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nWe begin by applying the principle of energy conservation as dictated by the problem statement. The quenching condition is defined as the point where the total energy generated by the flame per unit area is exactly balanced by the total energy removed at the wall per unit area.\n\nLet's first define the energy generation rate of the flame per unit area, $q''_{gen}$. For a freely propagating adiabatic laminar flame, the heat generated by the chemical reaction is equal to the sensible enthalpy flux required to heat the unburned mixture from its initial temperature $T_u$ to the adiabatic flame temperature $T_{ad}$. This is given by:\n$$q''_{gen} = \\dot{m}'' c_p (T_{ad} - T_u)$$\nwhere $\\dot{m}'' = \\rho_u S_L$ is the mass flux of the unburned mixture into the flame front. Thus,\n$$q''_{gen} = \\rho_u S_L c_p (T_{ad} - T_u)$$\n\nNext, we define the total energy removed at the wall per unit area, $q''_{wall}$. This is the net energy flux from the gas phase into the wall located at $x=0$. This flux has two contributions: heat transfer by conduction and energy transfer by the diffusion of radical species which then release chemical energy upon recombination at the catalytic surface.\n\n$1$. Heat Conduction: The heat flux due to conduction is governed by Fourier's law, $q''_{cond} = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}$. The problem states that the temperature profile between the wall at $x=0$ (temperature $T_w$) and the flame front at $x=d$ (temperature $T_{ad}$) is linear.\n$$T(x) = T_w + (T_{ad} - T_w) \\frac{x}{d}$$\nThe temperature gradient is therefore constant in this region:\n$$\\frac{dT}{dx} = \\frac{T_{ad} - T_w}{d}$$\nThe heat flux conducted from the hot gas to the cooler wall at $x=0$ is:\n$$q''_{cond, wall} = -k \\left(\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right)_{x=0} = -k \\frac{T_{ad} - T_w}{d}$$\nThe energy removed from the gas by conduction at the wall is the magnitude of this flux, $k \\frac{T_{ad}-T_w}{d}$.\n\n$2$. Catalytic Recombination: Radical species diffuse from the flame front to the wall. The mass flux of radicals, $j_r$, is described by Fick's law, $j_r = -\\rho D_r \\frac{dY_r}{dx}$. The problem states a linear profile for the radical mass fraction $Y_r$ between the flame at $x=d$ ($Y_r = Y_r^*$) and the wall at $x=0$ (perfect sink, $Y_r = Y_{r,w} \\approx 0$).\n$$Y_r(x) = Y_r^* \\frac{x}{d}$$\nThe gradient of the radical mass fraction is:\n$$\\frac{dY_r}{dx} = \\frac{Y_r^*}{d}$$\nThe mass flux of radicals reaching the wall at $x=0$ is $j_{r,wall} = -\\rho D_r \\left(\\frac{dY_r}{dx}\\right)_{x=0}$.

The quenching is caused by the combined effects of flow-induced strain and flame front curvature. The solution will be built upon the linear theory of flame stretch.\n\nThe problem states that the diffusive-thermal response of the normal burning velocity, $S_n$, to flow-induced tangential strain and geometric curvature is linear. This can be expressed in terms of the unstretched planar laminar burning velocity, $S_L$, and the Markstein lengths for strain ($L_{\\sigma}$) and curvature ($L_{\\kappa}$). A general linear model is of the form:\n$$S_n - S_L = -(\\text{effect of strain}) - (\\text{effect of curvature})$$\n\nThe effect of strain is given by the product of the strain Markstein length, $L_{\\sigma}$, and the tangential strain rate, $\\sigma$. The effect of curvature is proportional to the curvature Markstein length, $L_{\\kappa}$, the curvature itself, $\\kappa_g$, and a characteristic velocity. While a fully implicit model would use $S_n$ as the characteristic velocity, a common and effective simplification, which renders the problem explicit, is to use $S_L$. This approximation is valid for small stretch effects where $S_n \\approx S_L$. We adopt this widely used explicit formulation, which is consistent with the problem's request for a closed-form solution without iterative or implicit dependencies.\n\nThe resulting model for the normal burning velocity is:\n$$S_n = S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma - L_{\\kappa} S_L \\kappa_g$$\n\nLet's verify the sign convention. The problem states that for $L_{\\kappa} > 0$, a positive curvature should reduce $S_n$. The flame is convex towards the unburned gas, which by convention means its curvature $\\kappa_g$ is positive. In our model, if $L_{\\kappa} > 0$ and $\\kappa_g > 0$, the term $- L_{\\kappa} S_L \\kappa_g$ is negative (since $S_L > 0$), thus reducing $S_n$ from $S_L$. This is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nThe problem provides the following information for the point of closest approach to the wall:\n1.  The local tangential strain rate is uniform and equal to $\\sigma$.\n2.  The leading-order mean geometric curvature magnitude is $\\kappa_g \\approx \\frac{1}{d}$, where $d$ is the minimum separation distance from the wall. Since the flame is convex towards the unburned gas, we take $\\kappa_g = \\frac{1}{d}$.\n\nSubstituting these into our model for $S_n$, we obtain an expression for the normal burning velocity as a function of the wall separation distance $d$:\n$$S_n(d) = S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma - \\frac{L_{\\kappa} S_L}{d}$$\n\nThe quenching distance, $d_q$, is defined as the smallest distance $d$ at which the local normal burning velocity vanishes, i.e., $S_n(d_q) = 0$. We apply this condition to the equation above:\n$$0 = S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma - \\frac{L_{\\kappa} S_L}{d_q}$$\n\nWe can now solve this algebraic equation for $d_q$. Rearranging the terms to isolate $d_q$:\n$$\\frac{L_{\\kappa} S_L}{d_q} = S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma$$\n\nAssuming that $S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma \\neq 0$ (if it were zero, $d_q$ would be infinite, meaning quenching does not occur at any finite distance due to curvature effects), we can solve for $d_q$:\n$$d_q = \\frac{L_{\\kappa} S_L}{S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma}$$\n\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the quenching distance $d_q$.\n\nNext, we must determine the conditions required for $d_q$ to be positive and finite.\n1.  For $d_q$ to be finite, the denominator cannot be zero. Thus, $S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma \\neq 0$.\n2.  For $d_q$ to be positive, the numerator and the denominator must have the same sign, since distance must be a positive quantity. The laminar burning velocity $S_L$ is inherently positive.\n\nLet's analyze the physical scenario. A flame is propagating far from the wall (where $d \\rightarrow \\infty$) and approaches the wall. For the flame to exist far from the wall, its burning velocity must be positive in the absence of curvature effects. The burning velocity far from the wall is given by $S_n(d \\rightarrow \\infty) = S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma > 0 \\implies S_L > L_{\\sigma} \\sigma$$\nThis condition means that the applied strain rate $\\sigma$ must be less than the extinction strain rate of a planar flame, $\\sigma_{ext, planar} = S_L / L_{\\sigma}$ (assuming $L_{\\sigma} > 0$). This ensures the denominator of our expression for $d_q$ is positive.\n\nWith a positive denominator, the numerator must also be positive for $d_q$ to be positive. Since $S_L > 0$, this requires:\n$$L_{\\kappa} S_L > 0 \\implies L_{\\kappa} > 0$$\nThis condition means that the flame must be of a type that is weakened by positive curvature (e.g., lean hydrocarbon-air flames, corresponding to a mixture Lewis number greater than unity). If $L_{\\kappa} < 0$, the curvature would enhance the burning velocity, preventing quenching as the flame approaches the wall.\n\nTherefore, the two conditions for a physically meaningful positive and finite quenching distance $d_q$ are:\n1.  $S_L > L_{\\sigma} \\sigma$\n2.  $L_{\\kappa} > 0$\n\nUnder these conditions, a flame that is stable under strain far from the wall will be progressively weakened by increasing curvature as it approaches the wall, eventually quenching at the distance $d_q$.",
