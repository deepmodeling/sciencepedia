Assume constant effective thermophysical properties and unity Lewis number (Lewis number (Le) equal to $1$) in the wall-adjacent layer, so that the same effective density $\\rho$, specific heat at constant pressure $c_{p}$, and thermal conductivity $k$ characterize the conduction to the wall and the enthalpy transport by the flame.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a classic scenario in combustion theory—flame quenching at a cold wall—using a standard set of simplifying assumptions (one-dimensional, steady, constant properties, unity Lewis number, thin flame) that render the problem analytically tractable. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or violations of physical principles.\n\nThe solution proceeds by deriving a scaling law for the quenching distance, $d_{q}$, using a control-volume energy balance.\n\nWe consider a flame held stationary at a distance $d_{q}$ from an isothermal wall at temperature $T_{w}$. An unburned mixture with temperature $T_{u}$ flows toward the flame at the laminar flame speed $S_{L}$. The flame is considered a thin sheet where chemical energy is released. The critical condition for quenching occurs when the heat generated by the flame is just balanced by the heat lost by conduction to the cold wall.\n\nThe rate of energy released per unit area by the flame, $\\dot{q}_{gen}$, must be sufficient to heat the incoming reactants from their unburned temperature $T_{u}$ to the adiabatic flame temperature $T_{b}$. This flux is given by:\n$$ \\dot{q}_{gen} = \\rho S_{L} c_{p} (T_{b} - T_{u}) $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $S_{L}$ is the laminar flame speed, and $c_{p}$ is the specific heat at constant pressure.\n\nThe rate of heat loss per unit area from the flame to the wall, $\\dot{q}_{loss}$, is governed by Fourier's law of conduction. Assuming a linear temperature gradient between the flame and the wall, this flux is:\n$$ \\dot{q}_{loss} = k \\frac{T_{flame} - T_{w}}{d_{q}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity. Under the thin flame assumption, the temperature of the flame sheet itself, $T_{flame}$, can be approximated by the adiabatic flame temperature, $T_{b}$.

Equating the two expressions gives the scaling relation:\n$$ \\rho S_{L} c_{p} (T_{b} - T_{u}) = k \\frac{T_{b} - T_{w}}{d_{q}} $$\n\nWe can solve this equation for the quenching distance $d_{q}$:\n$$ d_{q} = \\frac{k}{\\rho c_{p} S_{L}} \\frac{T_{b} - T_{w}}{T_{b} - T_{u}} $$\nIntroducing the thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha = k / (\\rho c_{p})$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ d_{q} = \\frac{\\alpha}{S_{L}} \\frac{T_{b} - T_{w}}{T_{b} - T_{u}} $$\nThe problem asks for the quenching Peclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe}_{q} = S_{L} d_{q} / \\alpha$.

The walls are perfectly conducting and maintained isothermal at the unburned-gas temperature, so transverse heat losses are dominated by radial conduction from the flame to the walls.

            "solution": "The propagation of a premixed flame in a narrow channel is determined by the balance between two competing processes: the heat released by the chemical reaction, which sustains the flame, and the heat lost from the flame to the cold channel walls, which tends to extinguish it. We can formalize this competition by comparing the characteristic time scales of these two processes.\n\nFirst, let's identify the dimensionless group that governs this balance using a time-scale analysis. The problem specifies a thin reaction zone of characteristic thickness $\\delta_L$. For an adiabatic, one-dimensional, planar flame, this thickness is related to the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$ and the laminar burning velocity $S_L$ as $\\delta_L = \\alpha / S_L$.\n\nThe **chemical reaction time scale**, $\\tau_{chem}$, can be defined as the time it takes for the flame to propagate through a distance equal to its own characteristic thickness. This represents the time required for the heat generated in the reaction zone to heat the adjacent unburned gas layer to its ignition temperature, thus sustaining propagation.\n$$ \\tau_{chem} \\sim \\frac{\\text{characteristic length}}{\\text{characteristic velocity}} = \\frac{\\delta_L}{S_L} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\delta_L$, we get:\n$$ \\tau_{chem} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha / S_L}{S_L} = \\frac{\\alpha}{S_L^2} $$\nThis time scale characterizes the rate of heat generation.\n\nThe **transverse heat diffusion time scale**, $\\tau_{diff}$, is the characteristic time for heat to be conducted from the hot core of the flame to the cold channel walls. The characteristic length for this process is the channel's transverse dimension, which is its diameter $D$. From the theory of diffusion, the time scale is proportional to the square of the length scale divided by the diffusivity.\n$$ \\tau_{diff} \\sim \\frac{(\\text{characteristic length})^2}{\\text{diffusivity}} = \\frac{D^2}{\\alpha} $$\nThis time scale characterizes the rate of heat loss.\n\nFor the flame to successfully propagate, the heat must be generated much faster than it is lost to the walls. This implies that the chemical time scale must be significantly smaller than the transverse diffusion time scale:\n$$ \\tau_{chem} \\ll \\tau_{diff} $$\nThe ratio of these two time scales forms a dimensionless group that quantifies the competition between heat generation and heat loss. Let's form the ratio $\\tau_{diff} / \\tau_{chem}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{diff}}{\\tau_{chem}} \\sim \\frac{D^2 / \\alpha}{\\alpha / S_L^2} = \\frac{D^2 S_L^2}{\\alpha^2} = \\left(\\frac{S_L D}{\\alpha}\\right)^2 $$\nThe problem defines the Peclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe}$, as the product of a characteristic velocity and length divided by thermal diffusivity. For flame propagation in a channel, the natural characteristic velocity is the laminar burning velocity $S_L$, and the characteristic length is the channel diameter $D$. Thus, the Peclet number is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{S_L D}{\\alpha} $$\nFrom our time-scale analysis, the dimensionless group governing the process is $\\mathrm{Pe}^2$. Consequently, the Peclet number $\\mathrm{Pe}$ is the fundamental dimensionless group that governs the competition between chemical heat release (related to axial convection) and transverse heat conduction to the walls.\n\nA marginal-propagation condition, also known as the quenching limit, occurs when the rate of heat loss becomes comparable to the rate of heat generation. At this limit, the flame is on the verge of extinction. This corresponds to the ratio of the time scales reaching a specific critical value, which is not necessarily unity due to geometric factors and the approximate nature of the time-scale definitions.\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{diff}}{\\tau_{chem}} = (\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\mathrm{crit}})^2 $$\nTherefore, the marginal-propagation condition can be stated in terms of a critical value of the Peclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. If $\\mathrm{Pe}  \\mathrm{Pe}_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the flame propagates. If $\\mathrm{Pe}  \\mathrm{Pe}_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the heat loss is too great, and the flame is quenched.\n\nThe problem provides the canonical result for this marginal-stability condition: $\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 65$. We can use this to derive an expression for the critical diameter, $D_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, which is the smallest channel diameter that can support a self-sustaining flame under the given conditions.\nAt the quenching limit, we have:\n$$ \\mathrm{Pe}_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{S_L D_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{\\alpha} $$\nSolving for $D_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ yields the desired analytic expression:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\alpha}{S_L} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided data:\n$S_{L} = 0.40$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$\n$\\alpha = 1.8 \\times 10^{-5}$ $\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$\n$\\mathrm{Pe}_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 65$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{65 \\times (1.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m^2/s})}{0.40 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}} $$\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{1.17 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m^3/s}}{0.40 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}} $$\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 2.925 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$) and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ 1 \\, \\mathrm{m} = 1000 \\, \\mathrm{mm} $$\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{crit}} = (2.925 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 1000 \\, \\mathrm{mm} = 2.925 \\, \\mathrm{mm} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 2.93 \\, \\mathrm{mm} $$",

The unburned mixture has constant properties, and the wall is aligned with the $x$-axis. Let the flame front be smooth and convex toward the unburned gas at its closest approach to the wall, with a minimum wall-normal separation distance $d$ at the point where the front is locally orthogonal to the wall. The local tangential strain rate induced by the flow along the flame front is uniform and equal to $\\sigma$ (with units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).

For small departures from a planar, unstretched flame, the diffusive-thermal response of $S_{n}$ to stretch and geometric curvature is linear, with two material parameters called Markstein lengths: a strain Markstein length $L_{\\sigma}$ and a curvature Markstein length $L_{\\kappa}$ (both with units of $\\mathrm{m}$). These parameters quantify the first-order sensitivity of $S_{n}$ to flow-induced tangential strain and to mean geometric curvature of the flame front, respectively.\n- At the point of closest approach to the wall, model the local geometry of the flame by its osculating circle and assume that the leading-order mean geometric curvature magnitude is $\\kappa_{g} \\approx \\frac{1}{d}$ (with sign chosen such that positive curvature reduces $S_{n}$ for mixtures with $L_{\\kappa}  0$).\n\nDefine the quenching distance $d_{q}$ as the smallest $d$ at which the local normal burning velocity vanishes at the closest point, i.e., $S_{n}(d_{q}) = 0$, signaling a stationary front at the wall due to the combined effects of flow-induced strain and curvature.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the quenching distance, $d_q$, for a premixed flame near an adiabatic wall. The quenching is caused by the combined effects of flow-induced strain and flame front curvature. The solution will be built upon the linear theory of flame stretch.\n\nThe problem states that the diffusive-thermal response of the normal burning velocity, $S_n$, to flow-induced tangential strain and geometric curvature is linear. This can be expressed in terms of the unstretched planar laminar burning velocity, $S_L$, and the Markstein lengths for strain ($L_{\\sigma}$) and curvature ($L_{\\kappa}$). A general linear model is of the form:\n$$S_n - S_L = -(\\text{effect of strain}) - (\\text{effect of curvature})$$\n\nThe effect of strain is given by the product of the strain Markstein length, $L_{\\sigma}$, and the tangential strain rate, $\\sigma$. The effect of curvature is proportional to the curvature Markstein length, $L_{\\kappa}$, the curvature itself, $\\kappa_g$, and a characteristic velocity. While a fully implicit model would use $S_n$ as the characteristic velocity, a common and effective simplification, which renders the problem explicit, is to use $S_L$. This approximation is valid for small stretch effects where $S_n \\approx S_L$. We adopt this widely used explicit formulation, which is consistent with the problem's request for a closed-form solution without iterative or implicit dependencies.\n\nThe resulting model for the normal burning velocity is:\n$$S_n = S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma - L_{\\kappa} S_L \\kappa_g$$\n\nLet's verify the sign convention. The problem states that for $L_{\\kappa}  0$, a positive curvature should reduce $S_n$. The flame is convex towards the unburned gas, which by convention means its curvature $\\kappa_g$ is positive. In our model, if $L_{\\kappa}  0$ and $\\kappa_g  0$, the term $- L_{\\kappa} S_L \\kappa_g$ is negative (since $S_L  0$), thus reducing $S_n$ from $S_L$. This is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nThe problem provides the following information for the point of closest approach to the wall:\n1.  The local tangential strain rate is uniform and equal to $\\sigma$.\n2.  The leading-order mean geometric curvature magnitude is $\\kappa_g \\approx \\frac{1}{d}$, where $d$ is the minimum separation distance from the wall. Since the flame is convex towards the unburned gas, we take $\\kappa_g = \\frac{1}{d}$.\n\nSubstituting these into our model for $S_n$, we obtain an expression for the normal burning velocity as a function of the wall separation distance $d$:\n$$S_n(d) = S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma - \\frac{L_{\\kappa} S_L}{d}$$\n\nThe quenching distance, $d_q$, is defined as the smallest distance $d$ at which the local normal burning velocity vanishes, i.e., $S_n(d_q) = 0$. We apply this condition to the equation above:\n$$0 = S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma - \\frac{L_{\\kappa} S_L}{d_q}$$\n\nWe can now solve this algebraic equation for $d_q$. Rearranging the terms to isolate $d_q$:\n$$\\frac{L_{\\kappa} S_L}{d_q} = S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma$$\n\nAssuming that $S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma \\neq 0$ (if it were zero, $d_q$ would be infinite, meaning quenching does not occur at any finite distance due to curvature effects), we can solve for $d_q$:\n$$d_q = \\frac{L_{\\kappa} S_L}{S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma}$$\n\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the quenching distance $d_q$.\n\nNext, we must determine the conditions required for $d_q$ to be positive and finite.\n1.  For $d_q$ to be finite, the denominator cannot be zero. Thus, $S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma \\neq 0$.\n2.  For $d_q$ to be positive, the numerator and the denominator must have the same sign, since distance must be a positive quantity. The laminar burning velocity $S_L$ is inherently positive.\n\nLet's analyze the physical scenario. A flame is propagating far from the wall (where $d \\rightarrow \\infty$) and approaches the wall. For the flame to exist far from the wall, its burning velocity must be positive in the absence of curvature effects. The burning velocity far from the wall is given by $S_n(d \\rightarrow \\infty) = S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$S_L - L_{\\sigma} \\sigma  0 \\implies S_L  L_{\\sigma} \\sigma$$\nThis condition means that the applied strain rate $\\sigma$ must be less than the extinction strain rate of a planar flame, $\\sigma_{ext, planar} = S_L / L_{\\sigma}$ (assuming $L_{\\sigma}  0$). This ensures the denominator of our expression for $d_q$ is positive.\n\nWith a positive denominator, the numerator must also be positive for $d_q$ to be positive. Since $S_L  0$, this requires:\n$$L_{\\kappa} S_L  0 \\implies L_{\\kappa}  0$$\nThis condition means that the flame must be of a type that is weakened by positive curvature (e.g., lean hydrocarbon-air flames, corresponding to a mixture Lewis number greater than unity). If $L_{\\kappa}  0$, the curvature would enhance the burning velocity, preventing quenching as the flame approaches the wall.\n\nTherefore, the two conditions for a physically meaningful positive and finite quenching distance $d_q$ are:\n1.  $S_L  L_{\\sigma} \\sigma$\n2.  $L_{\\kappa}  0$\n\nUnder these conditions, a flame that is stable under strain far from the wall will be progressively weakened by increasing curvature as it approaches the wall, eventually quenching at the distance $d_q$.",
