To build a solid foundation, this first practice invites you to quantify this relationship by calculating the sensitivity of the instability's growth rate, $\\omega$, with respect to the gas expansion ratio, $E$ .

            "problem": "A two-dimensional, inviscid, zero-thickness, planar premixed flame subject to small-amplitude sinusoidal perturbations of wavenumber magnitude $|k|$ exhibits the Darrieus-Landau (DL) hydrodynamic instability. Let $S_L$ denote the unstrained laminar flame speed, and let the gas expansion ratio be $E \\equiv \\rho_u/\\rho_b  1$, where $\\rho_u$ and $\\rho_b$ are the densities of the unburned and burned gases, respectively. In classical linear theory for such a flame, the temporal growth rate of a single Fourier mode is given by\n$$\\omega = S_L |k| \\frac{E - 1}{E + 1}.$$\nTreating $S_L$ and $|k|$ as constants, compute the parametric sensitivity of the growth rate with respect to the expansion ratio, $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}$, as an explicit analytic function of $E$, $S_L$, and $|k|$.

Your final reported answer must be the closed-form analytic expression for $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}$ only, with no units attached.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the parametric sensitivity of the Darrieus-Landau instability growth rate, $\\omega$, with respect to the gas expansion ratio, $E$. The given expression for the growth rate is:\n$$ \\omega = S_L |k| \\frac{E - 1}{E + 1} $$\nwhere $S_L$ is the unstrained laminar flame speed, $|k|$ is the perturbation wavenumber magnitude, and $E = \\rho_u / \\rho_b  1$ is the expansion ratio. We are tasked with computing the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}$, treating $S_L$ and $|k|$ as constants.\n\nTo find the sensitivity, we differentiate the expression for $\\omega$ with respect to $E$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E} \\left( S_L |k| \\frac{E - 1}{E + 1} \\right) $$\nSince $S_L$ and $|k|$ are treated as constants, we can factor them out of the derivative:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E} = S_L |k| \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E} \\left( \\frac{E - 1}{E + 1} \\right) $$\nWe apply the quotient rule for differentiation, which states that for functions $u(E)$ and $v(E)$, $\\frac{d}{dE}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{v \\frac{du}{dE} - u \\frac{dv}{dE}}{v^2}$. Let $u(E) = E - 1$ and $v(E) = E + 1$. Their derivatives with respect to $E$ are:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dE} = \\frac{d}{dE}(E - 1) = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{dv}{dE} = \\frac{d}{dE}(E + 1) = 1 $$\nSubstituting these into the quotient rule:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E} \\left( \\frac{E - 1}{E + 1} \\right) = \\frac{(E + 1)(1) - (E - 1)(1)}{(E + 1)^2} = \\frac{E + 1 - E + 1}{(E + 1)^2} = \\frac{2}{(E + 1)^2} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}$, we obtain the final analytic expression for the sensitivity:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E} = S_L |k| \\frac{2}{(E + 1)^2} $$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the sensitivity of the growth rate with respect to the expansion ratio.\n\nNext, we interpret the sign and magnitude of this sensitivity. The quantities $S_L$ and $|k|$ are physically positive ($S_L  0$ and $|k|  0$ for a non-trivial perturbation). The term $(E+1)^2$ is also strictly positive since $E  1$. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}$ is always positive. This signifies that the growth rate of the instability, $\\omega$, is a monotonically increasing function of the expansion ratio $E$. A larger density drop across the flame (i.e., a larger $E$) always leads to a stronger instability, which is physically expected as the instability is driven by the hydrodynamic effect of gas expansion.\n\nWe now analyze the limits as $E \\to 1^+$ and $E \\to \\infty$.\n\nIn the limit of weak expansion, $E \\to 1^+$:\n$$ \\lim_{E \\to 1^+} \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E} = \\lim_{E \\to 1^+} \\left( S_L |k| \\frac{2}{(E + 1)^2} \\right) = S_L |k| \\frac{2}{(1 + 1)^2} = S_L |k| \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} S_L |k| $$\nIn this limit, the sensitivity is a finite positive value. This means that as soon as the expansion ratio becomes slightly greater than $1$, the instability growth rate begins to increase. The growth rate itself is zero at $E=1$, so this sensitivity describes how rapidly the instability \"turns on\" for flames with very low heat release.\n\nIn the limit of strong expansion, $E \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{E \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E} = \\lim_{E \\to \\infty} \\left( S_L |k| \\frac{2}{(E + 1)^2} \\right) = 0 $$\nAs $E$ becomes very large, the denominator $(E+1)^2$ grows without bound, causing the sensitivity to approach zero. This indicates that while increasing $E$ always increases $\\omega$, the effect diminishes for very strong flames. The growth rate $\\omega$ approaches an asymptotic maximum value in this limit:\n$$ \\lim_{E \\to \\infty} \\omega = \\lim_{E \\to \\infty} \\left( S_L |k| \\frac{E - 1}{E + 1} \\right) = S_L |k| \\lim_{E \\to \\infty} \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{E}}{1 + \\frac{1}{E}} = S_L |k| $$\nThe sensitivity approaching zero reflects the fact that the growth rate is saturating at its theoretical maximum of $S_L |k|$. Further increases in the expansion ratio yield progressively smaller increases in the instability growth rate.\n\nFinally, we determine the units of $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}$. The growth rate $\\omega$ has units of inverse time, $[T]^{-1}$ (e.g., $s^{-1}$). The expansion ratio $E$ is a ratio of densities, making it dimensionless. Therefore, the units of the sensitivity are:\n$$ \\left[\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}\\right] = \\frac{[\\omega]}{[E]} = \\frac{[T]^{-1}}{1} = [T]^{-1} $$\nThe units of the sensitivity are inverse time, the same as the growth rate itself. We can verify this from the derived expression: $S_L$ has units of $[L][T]^{-1}$ and $|k|$ has units of $[L]^{-1}$. Their product, $S_L |k|$, has units of $[T]^{-1}$. The term $\\frac{2}{(E+1)^2}$ is dimensionless. Thus, the units are consistent.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a spectral routine to compute the nonlocal term $\\mathcal{H}\\{h_x\\}$ where $h_x = \\partial h / \\partial x$, for a periodic function $h(x)$ on a domain $x \\in [0, L)$. This computation is fundamental in the study of the Darrieus-Landau instability, where this term models the hydrodynamic feedback on the flame front velocity. The spectral method, which employs the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), is particularly well-suited for this task due to its high accuracy and efficiency when applied to smooth, periodic functions.\n\nThe foundational principle of the spectral method is the representation of functions and operators in Fourier space. A function $h(x)$ that is periodic on the interval $[0, L)$ can be expressed as a Fourier series:\n$$\nh(x) = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{h}_m e^{i k_m x}\n$$\nIn this expression, $k_m = 2\\pi m / L$ are the discrete angular wavenumbers, and $\\hat{h}_m$ are the complex-valued Fourier coefficients. For a function sampled on a discrete grid of $N$ points, $x_j = j \\Delta x$ with grid spacing $\\Delta x = L/N$, this series is replaced by its discrete counterpart, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The DFT coefficients, $\\hat{h}'_m$, are calculated from the sampled function values $h_j = h(x_j)$ as:\n$$\n\\hat{h}'_m = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} h_j e^{-i 2\\pi m j / N}\n$$\nThese coefficients $\\hat{h}'_m$ are approximations of the analytical coefficients $\\hat{h}_m$ and are computed efficiently using an FFT algorithm.\n\nIn the Fourier domain, linear operators such as differentiation and the Hilbert transform simplify to algebraic multiplications. We first analyze the derivative operator, $\\partial/\\partial x$. Applying this operator to a single Fourier basis function $e^{i k_m x}$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} e^{i k_m x} = i k_m e^{i k_m x}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the operation of differentiation in real space is equivalent to multiplication by the factor $i k_m$ in Fourier space. Consequently, the Fourier transform of the derivative, $\\mathcal{F}\\{h_x\\}$, is related to the Fourier transform of the function itself, $\\mathcal{F}\\{h\\}$, by $\\mathcal{F}\\{h_x\\}(k) = (i k) \\mathcal{F}\\{h\\}(k)$.\n\nNext, we consider the Hilbert transform, $\\mathcal{H}$.

Discretize the domain $[0, L)$ into a uniform grid of $N$ points, $x_j = j (L/N)$ for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$. Evaluate the input function $h(x_j)$ on this grid.\n2.  Compute the forward FFT of the discrete function $h_j$ to obtain its spectral coefficients, $\\hat{h}_m = \\text{FFT}(h_j)$.\n3.  Construct the corresponding array of discrete angular wavenumbers $k_m$. For a domain of length $L$ and $N$ grid points with spacing $\\Delta x = L/N$, the wavenumbers are given by $k_m = 2\\pi f_m$, where the frequencies $f_m$ are provided by the function `numpy.fft.fftfreq(N, d=\\Delta x)`.\n4.  Construct the spectral multiplier for the composite operator, which is simply the absolute value of the wavenumber array, $|k_m|$.\n5.  Apply the operator in Fourier space by element-wise multiplication: $\\widehat{\\mathcal{H}\\{h_x\\}}_m = |k_m| \\hat{h}_m$.\n6.  Compute the inverse FFT of the resulting product to transform the result back to physical space: $\\mathcal{H}\\{h_x\\}(x_j) = \\text{iFFT}(\\widehat{\\mathcal{H}\\{h_x\\}}_m)$.\n7.  The output of the inverse FFT is a complex-valued array. Since the operation on a real-valued input function $h(x)$ must yield a real-valued output, the real part of the result is taken. Any non-zero imaginary component is attributable to floating-point numerical error.\n8.  The accuracy of this numerical result is quantified by computing the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error against the provided analytical solution over the grid points. For the given test cases, which involve pure sinusoids well within the Nyquist limit of the grid, the spectral method is expected to yield errors close to machine precision.",
