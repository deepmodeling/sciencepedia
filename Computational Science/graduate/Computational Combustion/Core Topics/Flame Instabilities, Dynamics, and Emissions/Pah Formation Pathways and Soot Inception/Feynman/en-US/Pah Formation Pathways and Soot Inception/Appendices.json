A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Continuous Governing Equations**\n\nThe governing equations are derived from the principle of mass conservation for each section. The rate of change of mass concentration in a section equals the sum of all source and sink terms.\n\nFor section $1$, mass is added by nucleation at rate $J_{n}(t)$ and removed by transfer to section $2$. The transfer is a first-order process, meaning its rate is proportional to the concentration in section $1$, $M_{1}(t)$. The rate of mass loss from section $1$ is thus $k_{g}M_{1}(t)$. The ODE for $M_{1}(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dM_{1}}{dt} = J_{n}(t) - k_{g}M_{1}(t)\n$$\n\nFor section $2$, mass is added due to the transfer from section $1$. By conservation of mass, the rate of mass gain in section $2$ must be equal to the rate of mass loss from section $1$ due to this transfer, which is $k_{g}M_{1}(t)$. Other physical processes are neglected, so there are no other source or sink terms for section $2$. The ODE for $M_{2}(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dM_{2}}{dt} = k_{g}M_{1}(t)\n$$\nThe coupled system of ODEs is therefore:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dM_{1}}{dt} = J_{n} - k_{g}M_{1} \\\\\n\\frac{dM_{2}}{dt} = k_{g}M_{1}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Time-Discrete Update Scheme**\n\nWe discretize the ODEs over a time step $\\Delta t$, from time $t^{n}$ to $t^{n+1}$. The time derivative is approximated using a first-order finite difference: $\\frac{dM}{dt} \\approx \\frac{M^{n+1} - M^{n}}{\\Delta t}$.\n\nFor the $M_{1}$ equation, the nucleation source term $J_{n}$ is treated explicitly (evaluated at time $n$), and the inter-section transfer sink term, $-k_{g}M_{1}$, is treated implicitly (evaluated at time $n+1$) as specified. This yields:\n$$\n\\frac{M_{1}^{n+1} - M_{1}^{n}}{\\Delta t} = J_{n}^{n} - k_{g}M_{1}^{n+1}\n$$\nTo find the update rule for $M_{1}^{n+1}$, we rearrange the equation to solve for $M_{1}^{n+1}$:\n$$\nM_{1}^{n+1} - M_{1}^{n} = \\Delta t J_{n}^{n} - \\Delta t k_{g}M_{1}^{n+1}\n$$\n$$\nM_{1}^{n+1} + \\Delta t k_{g}M_{1}^{n+1} = M_{1}^{n} + \\Delta t J_{n}^{n}\n$$\n$$\nM_{1}^{n+1}(1 + k_{g}\\Delta t) = M_{1}^{n} + \\Delta t J_{n}^{n}\n$$\n$$\nM_{1}^{n+1} = \\frac{M_{1}^{n} + \\Delta t J_{n}^{n}}{1 + k_{g}\\Delta t}\n$$\nThis scheme is positivity-preserving because if $M_{1}^{n} \\ge 0$, then given $J_{n}^{n} \\ge 0$, $k_{g} > 0$, and $\\Delta t > 0$, both the numerator and the denominator are positive, ensuring $M_{1}^{n+1} \\ge 0$.\n\nFor the $M_{2}$ equation, the source term must be \"flux-consistent\" to conserve mass. This means the mass sink from section $1$ must be identical to the mass source for section $2$ in the discrete scheme. The sink term for $M_1$ was taken to be $k_{g}M_{1}^{n+1}$. Therefore, the source term for $M_2$ must also be $k_{g}M_{1}^{n+1}$. This leads to the following discrete equation for $M_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{M_{2}^{n+1} - M_{2}^{n}}{\\Delta t} = k_{g}M_{1}^{n+1}\n$$\nThis gives the update rule for $M_{2}^{n+1}$:\n$$\nM_{2}^{n+1} = M_{2}^{n} + \\Delta t k_{g} M_{1}^{n+1}\n$$\nTo verify mass conservation, we sum the two discrete equations:\n$$\n\\frac{M_{1}^{n+1} - M_{1}^{n}}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{M_{2}^{n+1} - M_{2}^{n}}{\\Delta t} = (J_{n}^{n} - k_{g}M_{1}^{n+1}) + (k_{g}M_{1}^{n+1})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{(M_{1}^{n+1} + M_{2}^{n+1}) - (M_{1}^{n} + M_{2}^{n})}{\\Delta t} = J_{n}^{n}\n$$\nLetting $M_{\\text{total}} = M_1 + M_2$, we have $M_{\\text{total}}^{n+1} - M_{\\text{total}}^{n} = J_{n}^{n}\\Delta t$. This shows that the total change in soot mass over the time step is correctly accounted for by the total mass added from nucleation, confirming the scheme's conservative property.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe problem provides the following data, with all mass concentrations and rates given in consistent units of $\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ and $\\mathrm{m}^{3}$:\n- $M_{1}^{n} = 2.50$\n- $M_{2}^{n} = 7.50$\n- $J_{n}^{n} = 1.20$\n- $k_{g} = 40$\n- $\\Delta t = 0.010$\n\nFirst, we compute the updated mass concentration in section $1$, $M_{1}^{n+1}$:\n$$\nM_{1}^{n+1} = \\frac{M_{1}^{n} + \\Delta t J_{n}^{n}}{1 + k_{g}\\Delta t} = \\frac{2.50 + (0.010)(1.20)}{1 + (40)(0.010)}\n$$\n$$\nM_{1}^{n+1} = \\frac{2.50 + 0.012}{1 + 0.40} = \\frac{2.512}{1.40}\n$$\n$$\nM_{1}^{n+1} \\approx 1.7942857...\n$$\nNext, we use this value to compute the updated mass concentration in section $2$, $M_{2}^{n+1}$:\n$$\nM_{2}^{n+1} = M_{2}^{n} + \\Delta t k_{g} M_{1}^{n+1}\n$$\n$$\nM_{2}^{n+1} = 7.50 + (0.010)(40) \\left( \\frac{2.512}{1.40} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nM_{2}^{n+1} = 7.50 + 0.40 \\left( \\frac{2.512}{1.40} \\right) = 7.50 + \\frac{1.0048}{1.40}\n$$\n$$\nM_{2}^{n+1} = 7.50 + 0.71771428...\n$$\n$$\nM_{2}^{n+1} \\approx 8.21771428...\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $8.217$. The fifth digit is $7$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\nM_{2}^{n+1} \\approx 8.218\n$$\nThe final value, in the required units, is $8.218\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.",
