            "problem": "In compressible reacting flows modeled by the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations, density-weighted (Favre) averaging is used to mitigate spurious correlations that arise from density fluctuations.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It consists of standard definitions and a well-defined theoretical model from the field of turbulent combustion.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Reynolds average of the Favre fluctuation, $\\overline{f''}$, and to analyze the conditions under which it is non-zero.\n\nWe begin with the definition of the Favre fluctuation of a scalar quantity $f$:\n$$ f'' \\equiv f - \\tilde{f} $$\nThe Favre average, $\\tilde{f}$, is defined as:\n$$ \\tilde{f} \\equiv \\frac{\\overline{\\rho f}}{\\overline{\\rho}} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $\\overline{(\\cdot)}$ denotes the Reynolds average, and it is given that $\\overline{\\rho} \\neq 0$.\n\nTo find $\\overline{f''}$, we apply the Reynolds averaging operator to the definition of $f''$:\n$$ \\overline{f''} = \\overline{f - \\tilde{f}} $$\nBy the linearity of the Reynolds averaging operator, this becomes:\n$$ \\overline{f''} = \\overline{f} - \\overline{\\tilde{f}} $$\nThe term $\\tilde{f}$ is a ratio of two ensemble averages, $\\overline{\\rho f}$ and $\\overline{\\rho}$. An ensemble average of a random variable is a deterministic constant. Therefore, $\\tilde{f}$ is a constant with respect to the averaging operation. The average of a constant is the constant itself, so $\\overline{\\tilde{f}} = \\tilde{f}$.\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$ \\overline{f''} = \\overline{f} - \\tilde{f} $$\nNow, we substitute the definition of $\\tilde{f}$ to get the desired expression in terms of $\\overline{f}$, $\\overline{\\rho}$, and $\\overline{\\rho f}$:\n$$ \\overline{f''} = \\overline{f} - \\frac{\\overline{\\rho f}}{\\overline{\\rho}} $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\overline{f''} = \\frac{\\overline{\\rho}\\overline{f} - \\overline{\\rho f}}{\\overline{\\rho}} $$\nTo understand why $\\overline{f''} \\neq 0$ in general, we express $\\rho$ and $f$ using Reynolds decomposition, where a quantity is split into its mean and fluctuating parts: $\\rho = \\overline{\\rho} + \\rho'$ and $f = \\overline{f} + f'$. By definition, $\\overline{\\rho'} = 0$ and $\\overline{f'} = 0$. Let us examine the term $\\overline{\\rho f}$:\n$$ \\overline{\\rho f} = \\overline{(\\overline{\\rho} + \\rho')(\\overline{f} + f')} = \\overline{\\overline{\\rho}\\overline{f} + \\overline{\\rho}f' + \\rho'\\overline{f} + \\rho'f'} $$\nUsing the linearity of the average and the properties of fluctuations:\n$$ \\overline{\\rho f} = \\overline{\\rho}\\overline{f} + \\overline{\\rho}\\overline{f'} + \\overline{\\rho'}\\overline{f} + \\overline{\\rho'f'} = \\overline{\\rho}\\overline{f} + \\overline{\\rho}(0) + (0)\\overline{f} + \\overline{\\rho'f'} = \\overline{\\rho}\\overline{f} + \\overline{\\rho'f'} $$\nThe term $\\overline{\\rho'f'}$ is the covariance between the density fluctuations and the scalar fluctuations. Substituting this result into our expression for $\\overline{f''}$:\n$$ \\overline{f''} = \\frac{\\overline{\\rho}\\overline{f} - (\\overline{\\rho}\\overline{f} + \\overline{\\rho'f'})}{\\overline{\\rho}} = -\\frac{\\overline{\\rho'f'}}{\\overline{\\rho}} $$\nIn compressible reacting flows, significant density fluctuations $\\rho'$ are caused by both acoustic waves (compressibility) and, more importantly, large heat release from chemical reactions (thermo-acoustic effects and thermal expansion). A scalar quantity $f$, such as temperature or a species mass fraction, will also fluctuate strongly. These fluctuations are often highly correlated. For example, in a diffusion flame, regions of high temperature (large positive $f'$) are typically products of combustion and have expanded, resulting in low density (large negative $\\rho'$). This leads to a negative correlation, $\\overline{\\rho'f'}  0$. Since $\\overline{\\rho}$ is strictly positive, this implies $\\overline{f''}  0$. Because such correlations are ubiquitous in reacting flows, the term $\\overline{\\rho'f'}$ is generally non-zero, and consequently, $\\overline{f''} \\neq 0$.\n\nFrom the derived relation $\\overline{f''} = -\\frac{\\overline{\\rho'f'}}{\\overline{\\rho}}$, the precise statistical condition under which $\\overline{f''} = 0$ holds is that the covariance term must be zero:\n$$ \\overline{\\rho'f'} = 0 $$\nThis means that the density $\\rho$ and the scalar $f$ must be statistically uncorrelated.\n\n**Task 2: Explicit Calculation for a Linear Correlation Model**\n\nThe task is to compute $\\overline{f''}$ for a specific stochastic model. We are given:\n- $\\rho$ is a random variable with mean $\\overline{\\rho} \\equiv \\bar{\\rho}$ and variance $\\operatorname{Var}(\\rho) \\equiv \\sigma_{\\rho}^{2}$.\n- $f$ is modeled as $f = a + b \\rho + \\eta$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.\n- $\\eta$ is a zero-mean random variable, $\\overline{\\eta} = 0$, that is statistically independent of $\\rho$.\n\nWe will use the expression derived in Task 1:\n$$ \\overline{f''} = -\\frac{\\overline{\\rho'f'}}{\\bar{\\rho}} $$\nWe need to compute the covariance term $\\overline{\\rho'f'}$. To do this, we first find the Reynolds fluctuations $\\rho'$ and $f'$.\n\nThe density fluctuation is, by definition:\n$$ \\rho' = \\rho - \\overline{\\rho} = \\rho - \\bar{\\rho} $$\nTo find $f'$, we first compute the mean of $f$, $\\overline{f}$:\n$$ \\overline{f} = \\overline{a + b \\rho + \\eta} $$\nUsing the linearity of the averaging operator:\n$$ \\overline{f} = \\overline{a} + \\overline{b \\rho} + \\overline{\\eta} = a + b \\overline{\\rho} + \\overline{\\eta} $$\nSubstituting the given values $\\overline{\\rho} = \\bar{\\rho}$ and $\\overline{\\eta} = 0$:\n$$ \\overline{f} = a + b \\bar{\\rho} $$\nNow we can find the fluctuation $f'$:\n$$ f' = f - \\overline{f} = (a + b \\rho + \\eta) - (a + b \\bar{\\rho}) = b(\\rho - \\bar{\\rho}) + \\eta $$\nRecognizing that $\\rho - \\bar{\\rho} = \\rho'$, we can write:\n$$ f' = b \\rho' + \\eta $$\nNext, we compute the covariance $\\overline{\\rho'f'}$:\n$$ \\overline{\\rho'f'} = \\overline{\\rho'(b \\rho' + \\eta)} = \\overline{b(\\rho')^2 + \\rho'\\eta} $$\nBy linearity of the average:\n$$ \\overline{\\rho'f'} = b \\overline{(\\rho')^2} + \\overline{\\rho'\\eta} $$\nThe term $\\overline{(\\rho')^2}$ is the variance of $\\rho$, since $\\rho'$ is the deviation from the mean. Thus:\n$$ \\overline{(\\rho')^2} = \\operatorname{Var}(\\rho) = \\sigma_{\\rho}^{2} $$\nThe term $\\overline{\\rho'\\eta}$ is the covariance between $\\rho'$ and $\\eta$. The problem states that $\\rho$ and $\\eta$ are independent. A function of $\\rho$, such as $\\rho' = \\rho - \\bar{\\rho}$, is also independent of $\\eta$. For independent random variables, the expectation of their product is the product of their expectations:\n$$ \\overline{\\rho'\\eta} = \\overline{\\rho'} \\cdot \\overline{\\eta} $$\nBy definition, the mean of a fluctuation is zero, so $\\overline{\\rho'} = 0$. We are also given $\\overline{\\eta}=0$. Therefore:\n$$ \\overline{\\rho'\\eta} = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for the covariance:\n$$ \\overline{\\rho'f'} = b \\sigma_{\\rho}^{2} + 0 = b \\sigma_{\\rho}^{2} $$\nFinally, we substitute this covariance into our formula for $\\overline{f''}$:\n$$ \\overline{f''} = -\\frac{\\overline{\\rho'f'}}{\\bar{\\rho}} = -\\frac{b \\sigma_{\\rho}^{2}}{\\bar{\\rho}} $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for $\\overline{f''}$ in terms of the specified parameters.",

Derivation of the Favre-Averaged Continuity Equation**\n\nWe begin with the instantaneous continuity equation for a compressible fluid:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (\\rho u_i)}{\\partial x_i} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the instantaneous density and $u_i$ are the components of the instantaneous velocity vector. Applying the Reynolds averaging operator (an overbar) to the entire equation, and noting that differentiation and averaging commute, we obtain:\n$$\n\\overline{\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}} + \\overline{\\frac{\\partial (\\rho u_i)}{\\partial x_i}} = \\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\rho}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\rho u_i}}{\\partial x_i} = 0\n$$\nThe problem states that the flow is \"statistically steady,\" which implies that the time derivatives of all mean quantities are zero. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\rho}}{\\partial t} = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\rho u_i}}{\\partial x_i} = 0\n$$\nThis is the Reynolds-averaged continuity equation. To express this in terms of Favre-averaged velocities, we use the definition $\\tilde{\\phi} \\equiv \\overline{\\rho \\phi} / \\overline{\\rho}$, which implies $\\overline{\\rho u_i} = \\overline{\\rho} \\tilde{u_i}$. Substituting this into the equation yields the Favre-averaged continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\overline{\\rho} \\tilde{u_i})}{\\partial x_i} = 0\n$$\nFor the specified two-dimensional flow with velocity components $\\tilde{u}$ (in the $x$-direction) and $\\tilde{v}$ (in the $y$-direction), this equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\overline{\\rho} \\tilde{u})}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial (\\overline{\\rho} \\tilde{v})}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\n\n**2. Conservation of Streamwise Mass Flux, $M_x$**\n\nThe integrated streamwise mass flux per unit span is defined as $M_x \\equiv \\int_{-L}^{L} \\overline{\\rho}(y)\\,\\tilde{u}(y)\\,\\mathrm{d}y$. To determine if $M_x$ is conserved along the streamwise direction $x$, we evaluate its derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}M_x}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\int_{-L}^{L} \\overline{\\rho}(y)\\,\\tilde{u}(y)\\,\\mathrm{d}y\n$$\nSince the integration limits are constant, we can move the derivative inside the integral:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}M_x}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (\\overline{\\rho}\\,\\tilde{u})\\,\\mathrm{d}y\n$$\nFrom the Favre-averaged continuity equation derived above, we have the relation $\\frac{\\partial (\\overline{\\rho} \\tilde{u})}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\partial (\\overline{\\rho} \\tilde{v})}{\\partial y}$. Substituting this into the integral gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}M_x}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\left( -\\frac{\\partial (\\overline{\\rho} \\tilde{v})}{\\partial y} \\right) \\mathrm{d}y\n$$\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}M_x}{\\mathrm{d}x} = - \\left[ \\overline{\\rho}(y) \\tilde{v}(y) \\right]_{-L}^{+L} = - \\left( \\overline{\\rho}(+L)\\tilde{v}(+L) - \\overline{\\rho}(-L)\\tilde{v}(-L) \\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the boundary conditions $\\tilde{v}(-L) = 0$ and $\\tilde{v}(+L) = 0$. Applying these conditions, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}M_x}{\\mathrm{d}x} = - (0 - 0) = 0\n$$\nSince the derivative of $M_x$ with respect to $x$ is zero, the integrated streamwise mass flux $M_x$ is conserved along the $x$-direction. This is a direct consequence of the Favre-averaged continuity equation and the zero-flux boundary conditions.\n\n**3. Computation of $M_x$**\n\nWe now compute the value of $M_x$ using the given profiles for $\\overline{\\rho}(y)$ and $\\tilde{u}(y)$:\n$$\nM_x = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\left[\\frac{\\rho_{1}+\\rho_{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\rho_{1}-\\rho_{2}}{2}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right)\\right] \\left[\\frac{U_{1}+U_{2}}{2} + \\frac{U_{1}-U_{2}}{2}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right)\\right] \\mathrm{d}y\n$$\nLet's define constant coefficients for brevity:\n$\\rho_c = \\frac{\\rho_1+\\rho_2}{2}$, $\\rho_d = \\frac{\\rho_1-\\rho_2}{2}$, $U_c = \\frac{U_1+U_2}{2}$, $U_d = \\frac{U_1-U_2}{2}$.\nThe integrand becomes $(\\rho_c + \\rho_d \\tanh(y/\\delta)) (U_c + U_d \\tanh(y/\\delta))$, which expands to:\n$$\n\\rho_c U_c + (\\rho_c U_d + \\rho_d U_c) \\tanh\\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right) + \\rho_d U_d \\tanh^2\\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right)\n$$\nWe integrate this expression term by term from $y=-L$ to $y=+L$:\n$$\nM_x = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\rho_c U_c \\, \\mathrm{d}y + \\int_{-L}^{L} (\\rho_c U_d + \\rho_d U_c) \\tanh\\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}y + \\int_{-L}^{L} \\rho_d U_d \\tanh^2\\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}y\n$$\n- The first integral is $\\int_{-L}^{L} \\rho_c U_c \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\rho_c U_c [y]_{-L}^{L} = 2L \\rho_c U_c$.\n- The second integral is zero because $\\tanh(y/\\delta)$ is an odd function and the integration interval $[-L, L]$ is symmetric about the origin.\n- For the third integral, we use the identity $\\tanh^2(z) = 1 - \\text{sech}^2(z)$. The integrand $\\tanh^2(y/\\delta)$ is an even function.\n$$\n\\int_{-L}^{L} \\rho_d U_d \\tanh^2\\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}y = 2 \\rho_d U_d \\int_{0}^{L} \\tanh^2\\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}y\n$$\nLet $z = y/\\delta$, so $\\mathrm{d}y = \\delta \\, \\mathrm{d}z$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n2 \\rho_d U_d \\delta \\int_{0}^{L/\\delta} \\tanh^2(z) \\, \\mathrm{d}z = 2 \\rho_d U_d \\delta \\int_{0}^{L/\\delta} (1 - \\text{sech}^2(z)) \\, \\mathrm{d}z = 2 \\rho_d U_d \\delta [z - \\tanh(z)]_{0}^{L/\\delta}\n$$\nThis evaluates to $2 \\rho_d U_d \\delta (L/\\delta - \\tanh(L/\\delta)) = 2 \\rho_d U_d (L - \\delta \\tanh(L/\\delta))$.\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n$$\nM_x = 2L \\rho_c U_c + 2 \\rho_d U_d (L - \\delta \\tanh(L/\\delta)) = 2L(\\rho_c U_c + \\rho_d U_d) - 2 \\delta \\rho_d U_d \\tanh(L/\\delta)\n$$\nWe simplify the combinations of coefficients:\n$\\rho_c U_c + \\rho_d U_d = \\frac{1}{4}[(\\rho_1+\\rho_2)(U_1+U_2) + (\\rho_1-\\rho_2)(U_1-U_2)] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\rho_1 U_1 + \\rho_2 U_2)$.\n$\\rho_d U_d = \\frac{1}{4}(\\rho_1-\\rho_2)(U_1-U_2)$.\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $M_x$:\n$$\nM_x = 2L \\frac{\\rho_1 U_1 + \\rho_2 U_2}{2} - 2\\delta \\frac{(\\rho_1-\\rho_2)(U_1-U_2)}{4} \\tanh(L/\\delta)\n$$\n$$\nM_x = L(\\rho_1 U_1 + \\rho_2 U_2) - \\frac{\\delta}{2}(\\rho_1-\\rho_2)(U_1-U_2) \\tanh(L/\\delta)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$\\rho_1 = 0.40$, $\\rho_2 = 1.20$, $U_1 = 600$, $U_2 = 150$, $\\delta = 0.010$, $L = 0.050$.\n$$\n\\rho_1 U_1 = (0.40)(600) = 240.0\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_2 U_2 = (1.20)(150) = 180.0\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_1 - \\rho_2 = 0.40 - 1.20 = -0.80\n$$\n$$\nU_1 - U_2 = 600 - 150 = 450\n$$\n$$\nL/\\delta = 0.050 / 0.010 = 5.0\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $M_x$:\n$$\nM_x = 0.050 \\times (240.0 + 180.0) - \\frac{0.010}{2} \\times (-0.80) \\times (450) \\times \\tanh(5.0)\n$$\n$$\nM_x = 0.050 \\times (420.0) - 0.005 \\times (-360) \\times \\tanh(5.0)\n$$\n$$\nM_x = 21.0 + 1.8 \\times \\tanh(5.0)\n$$\nUsing the value $\\tanh(5.0) \\approx 0.999909204$:\n$$\nM_x \\approx 21.0 + 1.8 \\times 0.999909204 = 21.0 + 1.799836567 = 22.799836567\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $M_x = 22.80$.

Verification of Continuity Balance**\n\nAs a final check, we integrate the Favre-averaged continuity equation across the layer width:\n$$\n\\int_{-L}^{L} \\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\overline{\\rho} \\tilde{u})}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial (\\overline{\\rho} \\tilde{v})}{\\partial y}\\right) \\mathrm{d}y = 0\n$$\nThis leads to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\int_{-L}^{L} \\overline{\\rho} \\tilde{u} \\, \\mathrm{d}y + \\left[\\overline{\\rho} \\tilde{v}\\right]_{-L}^{L} = 0\n$$\nwhich is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}M_x}{\\mathrm{d}x} + \\left[\\overline{\\rho} \\tilde{v}\\right]_{-L}^{L} = 0$. The term $[\\overline{\\rho} \\tilde{v}]_{-L}^{+L}$ represents the net mean mass flux per unit span entering the domain in the cross-stream direction. Given the boundary conditions $\\tilde{v}(+L) = 0$ and $\\tilde{v}(-L) = 0$, this term is zero. This verifies that there is no net mass exchange through the top and bottom boundaries. As a direct consequence, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}M_x}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 0$, confirming again that the streamwise mass flux $M_x$ is conserved. This demonstrates the internal consistency of the problem setup.",

The use of a Beta distribution for the mixture fraction PDF is a common and validated approach. The mathematical structure is sound, and all required information for the derivations is provided. The problem is free from scientific inaccuracies, ambiguities, or contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with a complete solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Mean Volumetric Production Rate\n\nThe mean volumetric production rate, $\\overline{\\dot{\\omega}}$, is given by the integral of the conditional source term weighted by the Favre PDF over all possible values of the mixture fraction $Z$.\n$$\n\\overline{\\dot{\\omega}} = \\overline{\\rho}\\,\\int_{0}^{1} \\hat{\\omega}(Z)\\, p_{F}(Z;a,b)\\, dZ\n$$\nSubstituting the given expressions for $\\hat{\\omega}(Z)$ and $p_{F}(Z;a,b)$:\n$$\n\\overline{\\dot{\\omega}} = \\overline{\\rho}\\,\\int_{0}^{1} \\left( \\Omega_{0}\\, Z^{p}\\,(1-Z)^{q} \\right) \\left( \\frac{Z^{a-1}(1-Z)^{b-1}}{B(a,b)} \\right) dZ\n$$\nThe terms $\\overline{\\rho}$, $\\Omega_0$, and $B(a,b)$ are not functions of the integration variable $Z$, so they can be moved outside the integral.\n$$\n\\overline{\\dot{\\omega}} = \\frac{\\overline{\\rho}\\,\\Omega_{0}}{B(a,b)} \\int_{0}^{1} Z^{p}Z^{a-1} (1-Z)^{q}(1-Z)^{b-1}\\, dZ\n$$\nCombining the powers of $Z$ and $(1-Z)$:\n$$\n\\overline{\\dot{\\omega}} = \\frac{\\overline{\\rho}\\,\\Omega_{0}}{B(a,b)} \\int_{0}^{1} Z^{(a+p)-1} (1-Z)^{(b+q)-1}\\, dZ\n$$\nThe integral is the definition of the Euler Beta function, $B(x,y) = \\int_{0}^{1} t^{x-1}(1-t)^{y-1}dt$. In our case, the parameters are $x = a+p$ and $y = b+q$. The conditions $a0, p0$ and $b0, q0$ ensure that $a+p0$ and $b+q0$, so the resulting Beta function is well-defined.\nThus, the integral evaluates to $B(a+p, b+q)$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\overline{\\dot{\\omega}}$ yields the closed-form solution:\n$$\n\\overline{\\dot{\\omega}} = \\overline{\\rho}\\,\\Omega_{0} \\frac{B(a+p, b+q)}{B(a,b)}\n$$\n\n### Derivation of the Logarithmic Sensitivities\n\nThe next step is to derive the logarithmic sensitivities, $S_a$ and $S_b$. First, we take the natural logarithm of the derived expression for $\\overline{\\dot{\\omega}}$:\n$$\n\\ln \\overline{\\dot{\\omega}} = \\ln\\left( \\overline{\\rho}\\,\\Omega_{0} \\frac{B(a+p, b+q)}{B(a,b)} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this can be expanded as:\n$$\n\\ln \\overline{\\dot{\\omega}} = \\ln(\\overline{\\rho}\\,\\Omega_{0}) + \\ln(B(a+p, b+q)) - \\ln(B(a,b))\n$$\nTo compute the partial derivatives with respect to $a$ and $b$, we need the derivative of the logarithm of the Beta function. We use the relationship between the Beta function and the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z)$:\n$B(x,y) = \\frac{\\Gamma(x)\\Gamma(y)}{\\Gamma(x+y)}$.\nTaking the logarithm gives:\n$\\ln(B(x,y)) = \\ln(\\Gamma(x)) + \\ln(\\Gamma(y)) - \\ln(\\Gamma(x+y))$.\nThe derivative of the logarithm of the Gamma function is the Digamma function, $\\psi(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}\\ln(\\Gamma(z))$.\nThe partial derivative of $\\ln(B(x,y))$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\ln(B(x,y)) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\ln(\\Gamma(x)) - \\frac{d}{d(x+y)}\\ln(\\Gamma(x+y))\\frac{\\partial(x+y)}{\\partial x} = \\psi(x) - \\psi(x+y)\n$$\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to $y$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\ln(B(x,y)) = \\psi(y) - \\psi(x+y)\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the sensitivity $S_a$:\n$$\nS_{a} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a}\\left[\\ln \\overline{\\dot{\\omega}}\\right] = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\left[ \\ln(\\overline{\\rho}\\,\\Omega_{0}) + \\ln(B(a+p, b+q)) - \\ln(B(a,b)) \\right]\n$$\nThe first term $\\ln(\\overline{\\rho}\\,\\Omega_{0})$ is constant with respect to $a$, so its derivative is zero.\n$$\nS_{a} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\ln(B(a+p, b+q)) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\ln(B(a,b))\n$$\nApplying the derivative formula we derived:\nFor the first term, $x=a+p$ and $y=b+q$. The derivative is with respect to $a$.\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\ln(B(a+p, b+q)) = \\psi(a+p) - \\psi(a+p+b+q)$.\nFor the second term, $x=a$ and $y=b$.\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\ln(B(a,b)) = \\psi(a) - \\psi(a+b)$.\nCombining these results:\n$$\nS_{a} = (\\psi(a+p) - \\psi(a+b+p+q)) - (\\psi(a) - \\psi(a+b))\n$$\nRearranging the terms for clarity:\n$$\nS_{a} = \\psi(a+p) - \\psi(a) + \\psi(a+b) - \\psi(a+b+p+q)\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the sensitivity $S_b$ in a similar manner:\n$$\nS_{b} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b}\\left[\\ln \\overline{\\dot{\\omega}}\\right] = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b} \\left[ \\ln(\\overline{\\rho}\\,\\Omega_{0}) + \\ln(B(a+p, b+q)) - \\ln(B(a,b)) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nS_{b} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b} \\ln(B(a+p, b+q)) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b} \\ln(B(a,b))\n$$\nApplying the derivative formula for the partial with respect to the second argument:\nFor the first term, $x=a+p$ and $y=b+q$. The derivative is with respect to $b$.\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b} \\ln(B(a+p, b+q)) = \\psi(b+q) - \\psi(a+p+b+q)$.\nFor the second term, $x=a$ and $y=b$.\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b} \\ln(B(a,b)) = \\psi(b) - \\psi(a+b)$.\nCombining these results:\n$$\nS_{b} = (\\psi(b+q) - \\psi(a+b+p+q)) - (\\psi(b) - \\psi(a+b))\n$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\nS_{b} = \\psi(b+q) - \\psi(b) + \\psi(a+b) - \\psi(a+b+p+q)\n$$\nThis completes the derivations for the mean source term and its logarithmic sensitivities with respect to the Beta-PDF shape parameters.",
