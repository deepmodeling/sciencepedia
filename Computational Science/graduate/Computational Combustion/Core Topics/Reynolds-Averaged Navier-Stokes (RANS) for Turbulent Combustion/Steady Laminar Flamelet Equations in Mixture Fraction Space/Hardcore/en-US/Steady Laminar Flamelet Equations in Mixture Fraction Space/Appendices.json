            "problem": "Consider a steady, nonpremixed laminar flamelet in mixture fraction space formed by counterflowing methane and dry air at temperature $T=300\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and pressure $p=1\\ \\mathrm{atm}$. The fuel stream is pure methane $\\mathrm{CH_4}$ and the oxidizer stream is a binary ideal mixture of oxygen $\\mathrm{O_2}$ and nitrogen $\\mathrm{N_2}$ with mole fractions $x_{\\mathrm{O_2}}=0.21$ and $x_{\\mathrm{N_2}}=0.79$. Assume no carbon or hydrogen in the oxidizer and no oxygen in the fuel. The atomic weights are $W_C=12$, $W_H=1$, and $W_O=16$, and the molecular weights are $W_{\\mathrm{CH_4}}=16$, $W_{\\mathrm{O_2}}=32$, and $W_{\\mathrm{N_2}}=28$.\n\nUsing elemental conservation and the stoichiometry of complete oxidation of methane, derive the conserved scalar combination of elemental mass fractions that is constant across the flamelet and construct a normalization that defines the mixture fraction $Z$ with $Z=0$ in the oxidizer stream and $Z=1$ in the fuel stream. Then, compute the stoichiometric mixture fraction $Z_{st}$ for the given streams. For the fuel stream, use the elemental mass fractions $Y_C^{f}=12/16$, $Y_H^{f}=4/16$, and $Y_O^{f}=0$. For the oxidizer stream, first compute the oxygen species mass fraction $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{ox}$ from the definition of mass fraction $Y_i = x_i W_i/\\sum_j x_j W_j$ and take the elemental oxygen mass fraction to be $Y_O^{ox}=Y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{ox}$, with $Y_C^{ox}=0$ and $Y_H^{ox}=0$.\n\nExpress the final numerical value of $Z_{st}$ as a dimensionless decimal rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a conserved scalar, the construction of a mixture fraction definition, and the calculation of the stoichiometric mixture fraction, $Z_{st}$, for the combustion of methane in air. The solution proceeds in three parts: first, defining the mixture fraction based on conserved scalars; second, deriving an analytical expression for $Z_{st}$; and third, calculating its numerical value.\n\n**Part 1: Conserved Scalar and Mixture Fraction Definition**\n\nIn the theory of non-premixed combustion, assuming equal mass diffusivities for all species, the transport equation for the mass fraction of any chemical element $k$, denoted $Y_k$, lacks a source term because elements are conserved during chemical reactions. Such a quantity is called a conserved scalar. The governing equation for $Y_k$ in a steady flow is:\n$$ \\rho \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla Y_k = \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho D \\nabla Y_k) $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity vector, and $D$ is the mass diffusivity, assumed to be the same for all species and elements.\n\nAny linear combination of conserved scalars is also a conserved scalar. A general conserved scalar, $\\beta$, can be formed from elemental mass fractions $Y_C$, $Y_H$, and $Y_O$:\n$$ \\beta = \\alpha_C Y_C + \\alpha_H Y_H + \\alpha_O Y_O $$\nwhere $\\alpha_C$, $\\alpha_H$, and $\\alpha_O$ are arbitrary constants. A widely used form, known as the Bilger coupling function, is:\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{2 Y_C}{W_C} + \\frac{Y_H}{2W_H} - \\frac{Y_O}{W_O} $$\nThis particular combination is zero for the major products of complete hydrocarbon combustion, $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ and $\\mathrm{H_2O}$.\n\nThe mixture fraction, $Z$, is a specific conserved scalar that is normalized to have a value of $Z=0$ in the pure oxidizer stream and $Z=1$ in the pure fuel stream. This normalization is constructed as:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\beta - \\beta_{ox}}{\\beta_f - \\beta_{ox}} $$\nwhere $\\beta_f$ and $\\beta_{ox}$ are the values of the conserved scalar $\\beta$ in the fuel and oxidizer streams, respectively. A key consequence of this definition, under the equal diffusivity assumption, is that the mass fraction of any element $k$ at any point in the flow field is a linear function of $Z$:\n$$ Y_k(Z) = Z Y_k^f + (1-Z) Y_k^{ox} $$\nwhere $Y_k^f$ and $Y_k^{ox}$ are the elemental mass fractions in the fuel and oxidizer streams. This linear mixing rule is fundamental for flamelet analysis. Any valid definition of mixture fraction will lead to the same value for the stoichiometric mixture fraction, $Z_{st}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Stoichiometric Mixture Fraction ($Z_{st}$)**\n\nThe stoichiometric mixture fraction, $Z_{st}$, corresponds to the specific mixture composition where fuel and oxidizer are in perfect proportions for complete combustion. The complete combustion of methane ($\\mathrm{CH_4}$) is described by the stoichiometric chemical equation:\n$$ \\mathrm{CH_4} + 2\\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO_2} + 2\\mathrm{H_2O} $$\nAt the stoichiometric condition, all carbon atoms from the fuel are converted to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ and all hydrogen atoms are converted to $\\mathrm{H_2O}$. This implies a specific relationship between the molar quantities of the elements C, H, and O in the stoichiometric mixture. For every mole of carbon atoms (forming $\\mathrm{CO_2}$), two moles of oxygen atoms are required. For every two moles of hydrogen atoms (forming $\\mathrm{H_2O}$), one mole of oxygen atoms is required. This can be expressed in terms of moles of elements per unit mass of mixture, $n'_k = Y_k/W_k$, at the stoichiometric condition (subscript $st$):\n$$ n'_{O,st} = 2 n'_{C,st} + \\frac{1}{2} n'_{H,st} $$\nUsing the definitions $n'_k = Y_k/W_k$ and the given atomic weights $W_C=12$, $W_H=1$, and $W_O=16$, we can write this condition in terms of elemental mass fractions:\n$$ \\frac{Y_{O,st}}{16} = 2 \\frac{Y_{C,st}}{12} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{Y_{H,st}}{1} $$\nNow, we apply the linear mixing rule for each elemental mass fraction at the stoichiometric state $Z=Z_{st}$:\n$Y_{C,st} = Z_{st} Y_C^f + (1-Z_{st}) Y_C^{ox}$\n$Y_{H,st} = Z_{st} Y_H^f + (1-Z_{st}) Y_H^{ox}$\n$Y_{O,st} = Z_{st} Y_O^f + (1-Z_{st}) Y_O^{ox}$\n\nThe problem provides the elemental compositions of the fuel and oxidizer streams:\nFuel stream (pure $\\mathrm{CH_4}$): $Y_C^f = 12/16$, $Y_H^f = 4/16$, $Y_O^f = 0$.\nOxidizer stream (air): $Y_C^{ox} = 0$, $Y_H^{ox} = 0$. $Y_O^{ox}$ is nonzero.\nSubstituting these into the mixing rules at $Z=Z_{st}$:\n$Y_{C,st} = Z_{st} (12/16)$\n$Y_{H,st} = Z_{st} (4/16)$\n$Y_{O,st} = (1-Z_{st}) Y_O^{ox}$\n\nSubstitute these expressions back into the stoichiometric condition:\n$$ \\frac{(1-Z_{st}) Y_O^{ox}}{16} = 2 \\frac{Z_{st} (12/16)}{12} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{Z_{st} (4/16)}{1} $$\n$$ \\frac{(1-Z_{st}) Y_O^{ox}}{16} = 2 \\frac{Z_{st}}{16} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{4 Z_{st}}{16} $$\n$$ \\frac{(1-Z_{st}) Y_O^{ox}}{16} = \\frac{2 Z_{st}}{16} + \\frac{2 Z_{st}}{16} = \\frac{4 Z_{st}}{16} $$\nMultiplying both sides by $16$ yields:\n$$ (1-Z_{st}) Y_O^{ox} = 4 Z_{st} $$\nRearranging to solve for $Z_{st}$:\n$$ Y_O^{ox} - Z_{st} Y_O^{ox} = 4 Z_{st} $$\n$$ Y_O^{ox} = Z_{st} (4 + Y_O^{ox}) $$\n$$ Z_{st} = \\frac{Y_O^{ox}}{4 + Y_O^{ox}} $$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\nTo find the numerical value of $Z_{st}$, we must first calculate the elemental oxygen mass fraction in the oxidizer stream, $Y_O^{ox}$. The oxidizer is a mixture of $\\mathrm{O_2}$ and $\\mathrm{N_2}$ with mole fractions $x_{\\mathrm{O_2}}=0.21$ and $x_{\\mathrm{N_2}}=0.79$. The average molecular weight of the oxidizer, $W_{ox}$, is:\n$$ W_{ox} = x_{\\mathrm{O_2}}W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} + x_{\\mathrm{N_2}}W_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = (0.21)(32) + (0.79)(28) = 6.72 + 22.12 = 28.84 $$\nThe mass fraction of the $\\mathrm{O_2}$ species in the oxidizer stream, $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{ox}$, is:\n$$ Y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{ox} = \\frac{x_{\\mathrm{O_2}}W_{\\mathrm{O_2}}}{W_{ox}} = \\frac{(0.21)(32)}{28.84} = \\frac{6.72}{28.84} $$\nThe problem states to take the elemental oxygen mass fraction $Y_O^{ox}$ to be equal to $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{ox}$, as oxygen is the only oxygen-bearing species in the oxidizer stream.\n$$ Y_O^{ox} = \\frac{6.72}{28.84} $$\nNow, we substitute this value into the derived expression for $Z_{st}$:\n$$ Z_{st} = \\frac{\\frac{6.72}{28.84}}{4 + \\frac{6.72}{28.84}} = \\frac{6.72}{4(28.84) + 6.72} $$\n$$ Z_{st} = \\frac{6.72}{115.36 + 6.72} = \\frac{6.72}{122.08} $$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$ Z_{st} \\approx 0.05504587... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ Z_{st} \\approx 0.05505 $$",

Derivation of the Steady Flamelet BVP\n\nThe task is to derive the one-dimensional governing equation for a reaction progress variable $c(z)$ in mixture fraction space from the fundamental transport equation of a reactive scalar.\n\nWe begin with the conservation equation for a species mass fraction, $Y_k$, in physical space coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$ and time $t$:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial Y_k}{\\partial t} + \\rho \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla Y_k = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j}_k + \\dot{\\omega}_k\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity vector, $\\mathbf{j}_k$ is the diffusive mass flux vector of species $k$, and $\\dot{\\omega}_k$ is its chemical source term.\n\nWe introduce a series of simplifying assumptions characteristic of the laminar flamelet model:\n1.  **Steady State**: The flamelet is assumed to be statistically stationary, so all time derivatives are zero ($\\partial/\\partial t = 0$).\n2.  **Unity Lewis Numbers**: The thermal diffusivity is assumed equal to the mass diffusivity of all species ($\\mathrm{Le}_k = 1$). This allows us to model the diffusive flux with Fick's law using a single representative diffusion coefficient $D$: $\\mathbf{j}_k = -\\rho D \\nabla Y_k$.\n3.  **Conserved Scalar**: We introduce the mixture fraction, $z$, as a conserved scalar (i.e., its source term is zero). Its transport equation is:\n    $$\n    \\rho \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla z = \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho D \\nabla z)\n    $$\n4.  **Flamelet Assumption**: The flame structure is considered to be one-dimensional in mixture fraction space. This implies that gradients of reactive scalars along surfaces of constant $z$ are negligible compared to gradients across these surfaces. Mathematically, the gradient operator can be approximated as $\\nabla \\approx \\nabla z \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$.\n\nApplying the steady-state and unity Lewis number assumptions to the species transport equation yields:\n$$\n\\rho \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla Y_k = \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho D \\nabla Y_k) + \\dot{\\omega}_k\n$$\nNow, we perform a coordinate transformation from physical coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$ to a system where $z$ is one of the coordinates. Applying the flamelet assumption ($\\nabla \\approx \\nabla z \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$), the transport equation for $Y_k$ becomes:\n$$\n\\rho \\mathbf{v} \\cdot (\\nabla z \\frac{\\partial Y_k}{\\partial z}) = \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\rho D \\nabla z \\frac{\\partial Y_k}{\\partial z}\\right) + \\dot{\\omega}_k\n$$\nApplying the product rule to the divergence term on the right-hand side:\n$$\n(\\rho \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla z) \\frac{\\partial Y_k}{\\partial z} = \\left(\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho D \\nabla z)\\right) \\frac{\\partial Y_k}{\\partial z} + (\\rho D \\nabla z \\cdot \\nabla z) \\frac{\\partial^2 Y_k}{\\partial z^2} + \\dot{\\omega}_k\n$$\nWe recognize the term $\\rho \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla z$ as the advection of the mixture fraction, which, from its own transport equation, is equal to the diffusion term $\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho D \\nabla z)$. Substituting this into the equation, we find that the first term on the left-hand side and the first term on the right-hand side cancel:\n$$\n\\left(\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho D \\nabla z)\\right) \\frac{\\partial Y_k}{\\partial z} = \\left(\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho D \\nabla z)\\right) \\frac{\\partial Y_k}{\\partial z} + \\rho D |\\nabla z|^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 Y_k}{\\partial z^2} + \\dot{\\omega}_k\n$$\nThis simplifies to the flamelet equation for species $Y_k$:\n$$\n-\\rho D |\\nabla z|^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 Y_k}{\\partial z^2} = \\dot{\\omega}_k\n$$\nThe scalar dissipation rate, $\\chi$, is defined as the rate at which mixture fraction gradients are smoothed out by molecular diffusion, given by $\\chi = 2D |\\nabla z|^2$. Substituting this definition into the flamelet equation gives:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\rho \\chi}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 Y_k}{\\partial z^2} = \\dot{\\omega}_k\n$$\nLet's consider a single reaction progress variable, $c$, which represents the state of reaction, varying from $0$ (unburnt) to $1$ (fully burnt). Assuming its transport is analogous to that of a species mass fraction, and lumping the chemical source term and density into a single function $R(c) = \\dot{\\omega}_c(c)/\\rho$, we obtain the one-dimensional steady flamelet equation in mixture fraction space:\n$$\n\\frac{\\chi(z)}{2} \\frac{d^2 c}{dz^2} + R(c) = 0\n$$\nThis completes the derivation. The problem-specified BVP is thus shown to be a direct consequence of the standard assumptions underlying the steady laminar flamelet model, confirming its scientific consistency. The boundary conditions $c(0)=0$ and $c(1)=0$ represent unburnt conditions at the pure fuel ($z=1$) and pure oxidizer ($z=0$) streams.\n\n### 2. Numerical Solution Methodology\n\nThe governing BVP is solved using a numerical continuation method to trace the solution curve and identify turning points.\n\n#### 2.1. Discretization\n\nThe domain $z \\in [0,1]$ is discretized using a uniform grid with $N$ points, $z_j = j \\Delta z$ for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, where the grid spacing is $\\Delta z = 1/(N-1)$. The progress variable $c(z)$ is represented by its values $c_j = c(z_j)$ at these grid points. The boundary conditions fix $c_0 = 0$ and $c_{N-1} = 0$. The unknowns are the interior values $\\mathbf{c} = [c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{N-2}]^T$.\n\nThe second derivative term is approximated using a second-order central difference scheme:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d^2 c}{dz^2} \\right|_{z_j} \\approx \\frac{c_{j-1} - 2c_j + c_{j+1}}{\\Delta z^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the governing equation for each interior node $j=1, \\dots, N-2$ yields a system of $N-2$ nonlinear algebraic equations:\n$$\nF_j(\\mathbf{c}, \\chi_{st}) = \\frac{\\chi(z_j)}{2} \\frac{c_{j-1} - 2c_j + c_{j+1}}{(\\Delta z)^2} + R(c_j) = 0\n$$\nThis system can be written compactly as $F(\\mathbf{c}, \\chi_{st}) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\n#### 2.2. Pseudo-Arclength Continuation\n\nTo trace the solution curve, which may contain turning points (folds), we employ a pseudo-arclength continuation method. This method parameterizes the solution branch $(\\mathbf{c}(s), \\chi_{st}(s))$ by an arclength parameter $s$. The state vector is augmented to include the continuation parameter: $\\mathbf{u} = [\\mathbf{c}; \\chi_{st}]^T$, which has $N-1$ components. The original system $F(\\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{0}$ is now underdetermined. We add a constraint equation $N(\\mathbf{u})=0$ to close the system.\n\nThe method proceeds in a predictor-corrector fashion.\n\n**Initialization**: To start the continuation, two initial points on the solution curve, $\\mathbf{u}^0$ and $\\mathbf{u}^1$, are required. These are found by solving the original BVP $F(\\mathbf{c}, \\chi_{st})=\\mathbf{0}$ for two slightly different, small values of $\\chi_{st}$ (e.g., $\\chi_{st}^0$ and $\\chi_{st}^1 = 1.1\\chi_{st}^0$) using a standard Newton solver with a parabolic initial guess for $\\mathbf{c}$.\n\n**Predictor**: Given two converged points $\\mathbf{u}^{k-1}$ and $\\mathbf{u}^k$, we form a secant approximation to the tangent vector:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t}^k = \\frac{\\mathbf{u}^k - \\mathbf{u}^{k-1}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}^k - \\mathbf{u}^{k-1}\\|_2}\n$$\nThe next point on the curve is predicted by extrapolating along this tangent:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}^{k+1, p} = \\mathbf{u}^k + \\Delta s \\cdot \\mathbf{t}^k\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta s$ is a fixed arclength step size and $\\mathbf{u}^{k+1, p}$ is the predicted point.\n\n**Corrector**: The predicted point $\\mathbf{u}^{k+1, p}$ serves as the initial guess for a Newton solver to find the true solution $\\mathbf{u}^{k+1}$ on the curve. We solve the augmented system $\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{0}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{u}) = \\begin{pmatrix} F(\\mathbf{c}, \\chi_{st}) \\\\ N(\\mathbf{c}, \\chi_{st}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThe constraint $N(\\mathbf{u})=0$ defines a hyperplane orthogonal to the secant predictor, passing through the predicted point:\n$$\nN(\\mathbf{u}) = (\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{u}^{k+1, p}) \\cdot \\mathbf{t}^k = 0\n$$\nThe Newton iteration for the corrector step is $\\mathbf{u}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{u}_i - [J_G(\\mathbf{u}_i)]^{-1} \\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{u}_i)$, where $J_G$ is the augmented Jacobian matrix:\n$$\nJ_G = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\mathbf{c}} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\chi_{st}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial \\mathbf{c}} & \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial \\chi_{st}} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of $J_G$ are:\n-   $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\mathbf{c}}$: This is the $(N-2) \\times (N-2)$ standard tridiagonal Jacobian of the discretized BVP with respect to the interior solution values $\\mathbf{c}$. Its entries are $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial F_i}{\\partial c_j}$.\n-   $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\chi_{st}}$: An $(N-2) \\times 1$ column vector representing the sensitivity of the residual to the continuation parameter. From the definition of $F_j$ and $\\chi(z)$, its entries are $\\frac{\\partial F_j}{\\partial \\chi_{st}} = \\frac{1}{\\chi_{st}} \\frac{\\chi(z_j)}{2} \\frac{c_{j-1} - 2c_j + c_{j+1}}{(\\Delta z)^2}$.\n-   $\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial \\mathbf{c}}$: A $1 \\times (N-2)$ row vector. From the constraint equation, this is the transpose of the $\\mathbf{c}$-component of the tangent vector, $(\\mathbf{t}^k_c)^T$.\n-   $\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial \\chi_{st}}$: A scalar, which is the $\\chi_{st}$-component of the tangent vector, $t^k_\\chi$.\n\nAt each iteration, we solve the linear system $J_G \\delta \\mathbf{u} = -\\mathbf{G}$ for the update $\\delta \\mathbf{u}$.\n\n#### 2.3. Turning Point Detection\n\nTurning points (folds) in the solution curve correspond to local extrema of the continuation parameter $\\chi_{st}$ with respect to the arclength $s$. As the continuation proceeds, we store the sequence of converged parameter values $\\{\\chi_{st}^k\\}$. A turning point is detected at step $k$ if the sequence satisfies one of the following conditions:\n-   Extinction (maximum): $\\chi_{st}^{k-1} < \\chi_{st}^k > \\chi_{st}^{k+1}$\n-   Re-ignition (minimum): $\\chi_{st}^{k-1} > \\chi_{st}^k < \\chi_{st}^{k+1}$\n\nA small tolerance is applied to ensure the change in $\\chi_{st}$ is numerically significant, preventing false positives due to floating-point noise on nearly flat portions of the curve. The value $\\chi_{st}^k$ is then recorded as a turning point.",
