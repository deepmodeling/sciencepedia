Numerical value of $Z_{st}$ for the given methane-air system, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of combustion theory, specifically the flamelet/progress variable (FPV) model. The concepts of mixture fraction, stoichiometric ratio, and elemental conservation are standard in this field. The given chemical reaction for methane oxidation is correct. The numerical values for mole fractions and molar masses are standard and physically realistic. The problem is well-posed; it provides sufficient information to derive the requested expression and compute the numerical value. The language is objective and unambiguous. While the provided definition of $\\beta$ is non-standard (the canonical Bilger formulation differs in its coefficients), this does not invalidate the problem, as it is self-consistent. The problem can be solved using the fundamental definition of the mixture fraction as a conserved scalar representing the mass fraction originating from the fuel stream, which is the basis for the FPV approach. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n###\nThe problem requires the derivation of the stoichiometric mixture fraction, $Z_{st}$, and its numerical calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Expression for $Z_{st}$**\n\nThe mixture fraction, $Z$, is a conserved scalar that quantifies the state of mixing between a fuel stream (where $Z=1$) and an oxidizer stream (where $Z=0$). By its fundamental definition in a two-stream system, $Z$ represents the mass fraction of material at a point that originated from the fuel stream. If a small mass element $dm$ is composed of mass $dm_{fuel}$ from the fuel stream and $dm_{ox}$ from the oxidizer stream, then:\n$$Z = \\frac{dm_{fuel}}{dm_{fuel} + dm_{ox}}$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the ratio of mass from the oxidizer stream to mass from the fuel stream:\n$$\\frac{dm_{ox}}{dm_{fuel}} = \\frac{1-Z}{Z}$$\nA stoichiometric mixture is one in which the fuel and oxidizer are present in the exact proportions required for complete combustion, leaving no excess of either. Let $s$ be the stoichiometric oxygen-to-fuel mass ratio, defined from the reaction stoichiometry:\n$$s = \\frac{\\text{mass of } \\text{O}_2 \\text{ required}}{\\text{mass of fuel}}$$\nFor each unit mass of fuel, a mass $s$ of oxygen is required. This oxygen is supplied by the oxidizer stream. The mass fraction of $\\text{O}_2$ in the oxidizer stream is denoted by $Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}}$. Therefore, to provide a mass $s$ of $\\text{O}_2$, a total mass of $(s / Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}})$ of the oxidizer stream is needed.\nThis gives the stoichiometric mass ratio of oxidizer stream to fuel stream:\n$$\\left(\\frac{dm_{ox}}{dm_{fuel}}\\right)_{st} = \\frac{s}{Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}}}$$\nThe stoichiometric mixture fraction, $Z_{st}$, is the value of $Z$ that corresponds to this stoichiometric mixture. We equate the two expressions for the mass ratio:\n$$\\frac{1-Z_{st}}{Z_{st}} = \\frac{s}{Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}}}$$\nSolving for $Z_{st}$:\n$$Z_{st}^{-1} - 1 = \\frac{s}{Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}}}$$\n$$Z_{st}^{-1} = 1 + \\frac{s}{Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}}}$$\n$$Z_{st} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{s}{Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}}}}$$\nThis expression for $Z_{st}$ is in terms of $s$ and $Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}}$, as required by the problem statement. This derivation relies on the fundamental definition of the mixture fraction as a conserved scalar tracking the origin of mass, which is a cornerstone of the FPV approach and is consistent with the provided definition framework.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of $Z_{st}$**\n\nTo compute the value of $Z_{st}$, we must first calculate the values of $s$ and $Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}}$ from the given data.\n\n**1. Calculate the Stoichiometric Oxygen-to-Fuel Mass Ratio ($s$)**\nThe reaction is $\\text{CH}_4 + 2\\,\\text{O}_2 \\to \\text{CO}_2 + 2\\,\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$.\nThe ratio $s$ is the mass of $2$ moles of $\\text{O}_2$ divided by the mass of $1$ mole of $\\text{CH}_4$.\nFirst, calculate the molar masses using the provided atomic weights:\n$W_{\\text{CH}_4} = W_{\\text{C}} + 4 \\times W_{\\text{H}} = 12.011 + 4 \\times 1.008 = 16.043 \\, \\text{g/mol}$.\n$W_{\\text{O}_2} = 2 \\times W_{\\text{O}} = 2 \\times 15.999 = 31.998 \\, \\text{g/mol}$.\nNow, calculate $s$:\n$$s = \\frac{2 \\times W_{\\text{O}_2}}{1 \\times W_{\\text{CH}_4}} = \\frac{2 \\times 31.998}{16.043} = \\frac{63.996}{16.043} \\approx 3.989029$$\n\n**2. Calculate the Mass Fraction of Oxygen in the Oxidizer ($Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}}$)**\nThe oxidizer is air with mole fractions $x_{\\text{O}_2} = 0.21$ and $x_{\\text{N}_2} = 0.79$. The mass fraction of oxygen is given by the formula:\n$$Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}} = \\frac{x_{\\text{O}_2} W_{\\text{O}_2}}{x_{\\text{O}_2} W_{\\text{O}_2} + x_{\\text{N}_2} W_{\\text{N}_2}}$$\nWe need the molar mass of $\\text{N}_2$:\n$W_{\\text{N}_2} = 2 \\times W_{\\text{N}} = 2 \\times 14.007 = 28.014 \\, \\text{g/mol}$.\nThe denominator is the mean molar mass of the air mixture, $W_{\\text{air}}$:\n$W_{\\text{air}} = (0.21 \\times 31.998) + (0.79 \\times 28.014) = 6.71958 + 22.13106 = 28.85064 \\, \\text{g/mol}$.\nNow, calculate $Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}}$:\n$$Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}} = \\frac{0.21 \\times 31.998}{28.85064} = \\frac{6.71958}{28.85064} \\approx 0.232909$$\n\n**3. Calculate the Stoichiometric Mixture Fraction ($Z_{st}$)**\nSubstitute the calculated values of $s$ and $Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}}$ into the derived expression for $Z_{st}$:\n$$Z_{st} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{s}{Y_{\\text{O_2,ox}}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3.989029}{0.232909}}$$\n$$Z_{st} = \\frac{1}{1 + 17.1274} = \\frac{1}{18.1274} \\approx 0.055165$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$Z_{st} \\approx 0.05517$$",

Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Methodology\n\nThe core of the problem is to find and analyze the steady-state solutions $(c^\\star, T^\\star)$ to the given system of algebraic equations for different values of the scalar dissipation rate $\\chi$.\n\n**1. Simplification of the Steady-State System**\n\nThe two steady-state equations can be simplified. From equation (1), we have $\\omega(c^\\star, T^\\star) = \\chi c^\\star$. From equation (2), we have $\\omega(c^\\star, T^\\star) = \\frac{\\chi}{\\beta}(T^\\star - T_u)$. Equating these two expressions for $\\omega(c^\\star, T^\\star)$ yields a linear relationship between $c^\\star$ and $T^\\star$ for any non-trivial solution ($c^\\star \\neq 0$):\n$$ \\chi c^\\star = \\frac{\\chi}{\\beta}(T^\\star - T_u) $$\nSince $\\chi > 0$, we can divide by $\\chi$ to obtain:\n$$ c^\\star = \\frac{T^\\star - T_u}{\\beta} $$\nThis crucial relation shows that all steady-state solutions lie on a straight line in the $(T, c)$ phase space. This allows us to reduce the two-variable problem to a single-variable problem.\n\nThe problem statement requires $c^\\star \\in [0, 1]$.\n-   $c^\\star \\ge 0$ implies $T^\\star \\ge T_u$.\n-   $c^\\star \\le 1$ implies $T^\\star - T_u \\le \\beta$, or $T^\\star \\le T_u + \\beta$.\nThus, we must search for solutions in the temperature range $T^\\star \\in [T_u, T_u + \\beta]$.\n\n**2. Finding the Steady States**\n\nWe can identify two types of solutions:\n\n-   **The Trivial (Unburned) Solution**: One obvious solution is $c^\\star = 0$. Using the linear relation, this corresponds to $T^\\star = T_u$. Substituting $(c^\\star, T^\\star) = (0, T_u)$ into the original steady-state equations confirms it is a valid solution for all $\\chi > 0$, as $\\omega(0, T_u) = 0$.\n\n-   **Non-Trivial (Burning) Solutions**: For $c^\\star \\neq 0$, we substitute the linear relation for $c^\\star$ back into the definition of $\\omega(c^\\star, T^\\star)$ and equate it to $\\chi c^\\star$:\n    $$ k_0 \\, c^\\star (1 - c^\\star) \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{T^\\star}\\right) = \\chi c^\\star $$\n    Since $c^\\star \\neq 0$, we can divide by $c^\\star$:\n    $$ k_0 \\, (1 - c^\\star) \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{T^\\star}\\right) = \\chi $$\n    Now, substitute $c^\\star = (T^\\star - T_u) / \\beta$:\n    $$ k_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{T^\\star - T_u}{\\beta}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{T^\\star}\\right) = \\chi $$\n    This is a single nonlinear algebraic equation for $T^\\star$. The roots of this equation are the temperatures of the non-trivial steady states. Let us define a function $F(T)$ whose roots we seek:\n    $$ F(T) = k_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{T - T_u}{\\beta}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{T}\\right) - \\chi = 0 $$\n    We will solve this equation numerically for $T$ in the interval $(T_u, T_u + \\beta]$. For each valid root $T^\\star$, the corresponding $c^\\star$ is given by the linear relation. A robust numerical method involves scanning the interval for sign changes in $F(T)$ to bracket roots, then using a bisection-based algorithm like Brent's method to find the roots with high precision.\n\n**3. Linear Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the stability of a steady state $(c^\\star, T^\\star)$, we analyze the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$. A 2D linear system is stable if and only if the trace of its matrix is negative and its determinant is positive.\n$$ \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{J}) < 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\det(\\mathbf{J}) > 0 $$\nLet $\\omega_c = \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial c}$ and $\\omega_T = \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial T}$ be the partial derivatives evaluated at $(c^\\star, T^\\star)$.\n$$ \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{J}) = (\\omega_c - \\chi) + (\\beta \\omega_T - \\chi) = \\omega_c + \\beta \\omega_T - 2\\chi $$\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{J}) = (\\omega_c - \\chi)(\\beta \\omega_T - \\chi) - (\\beta \\omega_c)(\\omega_T) = \\chi^2 - \\chi(\\omega_c + \\beta \\omega_T) $$\nLet $S(c^\\star, T^\\star) = \\omega_c + \\beta \\omega_T$. The stability conditions become:\n1.  $S - 2\\chi < 0$\n2.  $\\chi(\\chi - S) > 0 \\implies S < \\chi$ (since $\\chi > 0$)\n\nThe second condition, $S < \\chi$, is stricter and is therefore the sole condition for stability.\n\n-   **Stability of the Trivial Solution $(0, T_u)$**:\n    At $(0, T_u)$, we have $\\omega_c(0,T_u) = k_0 \\exp(-E/T_u)$ and $\\omega_T(0,T_u) = 0$.\n    Thus, $S(0, T_u) = k_0 \\exp(-E/T_u)$.\n    The stability condition is $k_0 \\exp(-E/T_u) < \\chi$. For the given parameters, $k_0 \\exp(-E/T_u) = 50e^{-10} \\approx 0.00227$. All test values of $\\chi$ are greater than this threshold, so the trivial solution is stable in all cases.\n\n-   **Stability of Non-Trivial Solutions**:\n    We need to evaluate $S(c^\\star, T^\\star) < \\chi$. Using expressions derived from the steady-state relations for non-trivial solutions ($\\omega = \\chi c^\\star$ and $\\chi = k_0(1-c^\\star)e^{-E/T^\\star}$):\n    $$ \\omega_c = \\frac{\\chi(1-2c^\\star)}{1-c^\\star} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\omega_T = \\omega(c^\\star, T^\\star) \\frac{E}{(T^\\star)^2} = \\chi c^\\star \\frac{E}{(T^\\star)^2} $$\n    The stability condition $S < \\chi$ becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{\\chi(1-2c^\\star)}{1-c^\\star} + \\beta \\left(\\chi c^\\star \\frac{E}{(T^\\star)^2}\\right) < \\chi $$\n    Dividing by $\\chi$ and simplifying gives: $\\beta c^\\star \\frac{E}{(T^\\star)^2} < \\frac{c^\\star}{1-c^\\star}$. Since $c^\\star>0$, we can divide by $c^\\star$:\n    $$ \\beta \\frac{E}{(T^\\star)^2} < \\frac{1}{1-c^\\star} $$\n    Substituting $1-c^\\star = (\\beta - T^\\star + T_u)/\\beta$, this inequality simplifies to:\n    $$ (T^\\star)^2 + ET^\\star - E(\\beta + T_u) > 0 $$\n    This quadratic in $T^\\star$ is positive when $T^\\star$ is greater than the positive root of the corresponding equation. Let this critical temperature be $T_{crit}$:\n    $$ T_{crit} = \\frac{-E + \\sqrt{E^2 + 4E(\\beta + T_u)}}{2} $$\n    A non-trivial solution $(c^\\star, T^\\star)$ is stable if and only if $T^\\star > T_{crit}$.\n    For the given parameters, $T_{crit} = \\frac{-10 + \\sqrt{100 + 4(10)(6+1)}}{2} = \\frac{-10+\\sqrt{380}}{2} \\approx 4.7466$.\n\nThe maximum value of $\\chi$ for which a non-trivial solution can exist is known as the extinction scalar dissipation rate, $\\chi_{ext}$. This occurs when $\\chi$ is equal to the maximum of the reaction function $g(T) = k_0(1-(T-T_u)/\\beta) e^{-E/T}$. This maximum occurs precisely at $T=T_{crit}$, so $\\chi_{ext} = g(T_{crit})$. With the given parameters, $\\chi_{ext} \\approx 2.283$. If $\\chi > \\chi_{ext}$, only the trivial solution exists.\n\n**4. Computational Algorithm**\n1.  Define the constants $T_u, \\beta, E, k_0$.\n2.  Calculate the critical temperature for stability of non-trivial solutions, $T_{crit}$.\n3.  For each given $\\chi$:\n    a. Initialize a list of solutions. Add the trivial solution $(T^\\star=T_u, c^\\star=0)$ and its stability (True for all given $\\chi$).\n    b. Define the root-finding function $F(T)$ for the current $\\chi$.\n    c. Create a fine grid over the temperature interval $(T_u, T_u + \\beta]$.\n    d. Iterate through the grid to find pairs of points where $F(T)$ changes sign. Use a robust root-finder (e.g., `scipy.optimize.brentq`) within each such bracket to find a root $T^\\star$.\n    e. For each root $T^\\star$ found, calculate $c^\\star = (T^\\star-T_u)/\\beta$. Check if it's a valid physical solution, i.e., $c^\\star \\in (0, 1]$.\n    f. Determine the stability of the non-trivial solution: it is stable if $T^\\star > T_{crit}$, and unstable otherwise.\n    g. Collate all found solutions (trivial and non-trivial) and their stabilities.\n    h. Sort the solutions based on temperature in ascending order.\n    i. Extract the total number of solutions $N$, the maximum temperature $T_{\\max}$, and the ordered list of stability booleans.\n    j. Format the result for the current $\\chi$ as required.\n4.  Print the final list of results.",

There are no subjective elements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem in a specialized STEM field. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the Favre-filtered species mass fraction $\\tilde{Y}_{k}$. We begin with its definition:\n$$\n\\tilde{Y}_{k} = \\iint Y_{k}(Z,c)\\,\\tilde{\\mathcal{P}}_{Z,c}(Z,c)\\,\\mathrm{d}Z\\,\\mathrm{d}c\n$$\nThe integration is performed over the sample space of the random variables $Z$ and $c$, which is the unit square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n\nSubstituting the given expressions for the mapping $Y_{k}(Z,c)$ and the joint PDF $\\tilde{\\mathcal{P}}_{Z,c}(Z,c)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{Y}_{k} = \\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1} (Z\\,c) \\left( \\tilde{\\mathcal{P}}_{Z}(Z)\\,\\tilde{\\mathcal{P}}_{c}(c) \\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}Z\\,\\mathrm{d}c\n$$\nSince the integrand is separable and the joint PDF is factorized, we can separate the double integral into a product of two single integrals:\n$$\n\\tilde{Y}_{k} = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} Z\\,\\tilde{\\mathcal{P}}_{Z}(Z)\\,\\mathrm{d}Z \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} c\\,\\tilde{\\mathcal{P}}_{c}(c)\\,\\mathrm{d}c \\right)\n$$\nThese two integrals represent the Favre-mean (or the first moment) of the mixture fraction, $\\tilde{Z}$, and the Favre-mean of the progress variable, $\\tilde{c}$, respectively.\n$$\n\\tilde{Y}_{k} = \\tilde{Z} \\cdot \\tilde{c}\n$$\nWe now compute each mean value.\n\nFirst, we compute the Favre-mean of the progress variable, $\\tilde{c}$. Note that the problem statement denotes the center of the Dirac delta PDF as $\\tilde{c}$, which is consistent with the definition of the mean for this distribution. Let's prove this formally:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} c\\,\\tilde{\\mathcal{P}}_{c}(c)\\,\\mathrm{d}c = \\int_{0}^{1} c\\,\\delta(c-\\tilde{c})\\,\\mathrm{d}c\n$$\nBy the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, which states $\\int f(x)\\delta(x-x_0)\\mathrm{d}x = f(x_0)$ for an integral over a domain containing $x_0$, we have:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} c\\,\\delta(c-\\tilde{c})\\,\\mathrm{d}c = \\tilde{c}\n$$\nThis is valid since $\\tilde{c}$, being the Favre-mean of a variable $c \\in [0,1]$, must itself lie in $[0,1]$.\n\nNext, we compute the Favre-mean of the mixture fraction, $\\tilde{Z}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{Z} = \\int_{0}^{1} Z\\,\\tilde{\\mathcal{P}}_{Z}(Z)\\,\\mathrm{d}Z = \\int_{0}^{1} Z \\left( \\frac{Z^{\\alpha-1}(1-Z)^{\\beta-1}}{B(\\alpha,\\beta)} \\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}Z\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{Z} = \\frac{1}{B(\\alpha,\\beta)} \\int_{0}^{1} Z^{\\alpha}(1-Z)^{\\beta-1}\\,\\mathrm{d}Z\n$$\nThe integral in the numerator is, by definition, the Beta function $B(\\alpha+1, \\beta)$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\tilde{Z} = \\frac{B(\\alpha+1, \\beta)}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we use the definition of the Beta function in terms of the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z)$: $B(x,y) = \\frac{\\Gamma(x)\\Gamma(y)}{\\Gamma(x+y)}$.\n$$\n\\tilde{Z} = \\frac{\\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+1)\\Gamma(\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+1+\\beta)}}{\\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)}} = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+1)\\Gamma(\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+1+\\beta)} \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)}\n$$\nCanceling the common term $\\Gamma(\\beta)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{Z} = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+1)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta+1)}\n$$\nUsing the fundamental recurrence relation of the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z+1)=z\\Gamma(z)$, we have $\\Gamma(\\alpha+1)=\\alpha\\Gamma(\\alpha)$ and $\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta+1)=(\\alpha+\\beta)\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)$. Substituting these into the expression for $\\tilde{Z}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{Z} = \\frac{\\alpha\\Gamma(\\alpha)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)}{(\\alpha+\\beta)\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\n$$\nThis is the well-known result for the mean of a Beta-distributed random variable.\n\nFinally, we combine the results for the two means to obtain the expression for $\\tilde{Y}_{k}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{Y}_{k} = \\tilde{Z} \\cdot \\tilde{c} = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\\right) \\tilde{c}\n$$\n\n### Interpretation\nThe result $\\tilde{Y}_{k} = \\frac{\\alpha \\tilde{c}}{\\alpha+\\beta}$ has a clear interpretation in terms of statistical moments. The quantity $\\tilde{Y}_k$ is, by definition, the expected value of the product of the random variables $Z$ and $c$, denoted as $\\widetilde{Zc}$. The problem states that $Z$ and $c$ are statistically independent because their joint PDF factorizes. For independent random variables, the expectation of the product is equal to the product of their individual expectations (means):\n$$\n\\tilde{Y}_k = \\widetilde{Zc} = \\tilde{Z}\\tilde{c}\n$$\nOur calculation explicitly confirmed this principle. We found that the mean of the Beta-distributed variable $Z$ is $\\tilde{Z} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}$, and the mean of the variable $c$ with a Dirac-delta PDF at $\\tilde{c}$ is indeed $\\tilde{c}$. The final expression is simply the product of these two mean values.",
