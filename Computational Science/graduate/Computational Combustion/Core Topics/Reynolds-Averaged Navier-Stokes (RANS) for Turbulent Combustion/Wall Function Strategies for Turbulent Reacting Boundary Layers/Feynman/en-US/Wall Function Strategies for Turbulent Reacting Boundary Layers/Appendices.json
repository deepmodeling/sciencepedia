            "solution": "The goal is to determine whether near-wall extinction is expected by evaluating the Karlovitz number $Ka$ and Damköhler number $Da$, each constructed from fundamental time scales. The procedure is:\n\n1. Determine the turbulent dissipation rate $\\epsilon$ using the wall-function scaling in the logarithmic layer. The dissipation near the wall is modeled as\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{u_{\\tau}^{3}}{\\kappa\\, y}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values,\n$$\nu_{\\tau} = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{m/s}, \\quad \\kappa = 0.41, \\quad y = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m},\n$$\nwe compute\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{(0.6)^{3}}{0.41 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{0.216}{8.2 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 2.634146 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s^{3}}.\n$$\n\n2. Compute the Kolmogorov time scale $\\tau_{\\eta}$ using\n$$\n\\tau_{\\eta} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/2}.\n$$\nWith $\\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$ and $\\epsilon \\approx 2.634146 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s^{3}}$,\n$$\n\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon} \\approx \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.634146 \\times 10^{3}} \\approx 5.693 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s^2},\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\tau_{\\eta} \\approx \\left(5.693 \\times 10^{-9}\\right)^{1/2} \\approx 7.544 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}.\n$$\n\n3. Account for wall cooling by adjusting the chemical time scale via the Arrhenius sensitivity. The adjusted chemical time scale at $T_{w}$ is\n$$\n\\tau_{c}(T_{w}) = \\tau_{c,\\mathrm{ad}} \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{E_{a}}{\\bar{R}}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{w}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{ad}}}\\right)\\right).\n$$\nGiven $\\tau_{c,\\mathrm{ad}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $E_{a} = 1.20 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{J/mol}$, $\\bar{R} = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)}$, $T_{w} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $T_{\\mathrm{ad}} = 1800\\,\\mathrm{K}$,\n$$\n\\frac{E_{a}}{\\bar{R}} \\approx \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^{5}}{8.314} \\approx 1.44339 \\times 10^{4},\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{w}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{ad}}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1500} - \\frac{1}{1800} = \\frac{1}{1500} - \\frac{1}{1800} = \\frac{6 - 5}{9000} = \\frac{1}{9000} \\approx 1.11111 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}.\n$$\nTherefore, the exponent is\n$$\n\\frac{E_{a}}{\\bar{R}}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{w}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{ad}}}\\right) \\approx 1.44339 \\times 10^{4} \\times 1.11111 \\times 10^{-4} \\approx 1.60377,\n$$\nand thus\n$$\n\\tau_{c}(T_{w}) \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\times \\exp(1.60377) \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\times 4.970 \\approx 1.988 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}.\n$$\n\n4. Compute the Damköhler number $Da$ using its definition $Da = \\tau_{t}/\\tau_{c}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{t} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}, \\quad \\tau_{c} \\approx 1.988 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s},\n$$\nso\n$$\nDa \\approx \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.988 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 1.509.\n$$\n\n5. Compute the Karlovitz number $Ka$ using $Ka = \\tau_{c}/\\tau_{\\eta}$:\n$$\nKa \\approx \\frac{1.988 \\times 10^{-3}}{7.544 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 26.35.\n$$\n\n6. Apply the extinction criterion: extinction is expected if $Ka \\geq Ka_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ and $Da \\leq Da_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, with $Ka_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 1$ and $Da_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 1$. We have\n$$\nKa \\approx 26.35 \\geq 1 \\quad \\text{(true)},\n$$\nbut\n$$\nDa \\approx 1.509 \\leq 1 \\quad \\text{(false)}.\n$$\nSince both conditions are not simultaneously satisfied, near-wall extinction is not expected.\n\n7. Therefore, the extinction indicator $I$ is\n$$\nI = 0.\n$$\nNo rounding is necessary because the indicator is an exact dimensionless binary value.",
