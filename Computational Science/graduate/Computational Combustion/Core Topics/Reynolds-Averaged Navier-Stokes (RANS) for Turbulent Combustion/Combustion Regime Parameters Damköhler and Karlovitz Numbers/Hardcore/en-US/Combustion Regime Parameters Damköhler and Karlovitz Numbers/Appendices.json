            "solution": "We begin from the given definitions and inertial-range scaling to express the Karlovitz number in terms of controllable quantities.\n\nBy definition, the Karlovitz number is $Ka \\equiv \\tau_f/\\tau_\\eta$, with $\\tau_f \\equiv \\delta_L/S_L$ and $\\tau_\\eta \\equiv (\\nu/\\epsilon)^{1/2}$. Using $\\epsilon \\approx C_\\epsilon\\, u'^3 / L$, we have\n$$\n\\tau_\\eta \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{C_\\epsilon u'^3/L}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu L}{C_\\epsilon u'^3}\\right)^{1/2}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nKa \\equiv \\frac{\\tau_f}{\\tau_\\eta} \\approx \\frac{\\delta_L/S_L}{\\left(\\nu L/(C_\\epsilon u'^3)\\right)^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{C_\\epsilon}{\\nu L}}\\, \\frac{\\delta_L}{S_L}\\, u'^{3/2}.\n$$\nRearranging to make the dependence on the turbulence–flame speed ratio explicit,\n$$\nKa \\approx \\sqrt{C_\\epsilon}\\,\\left(\\frac{u'}{S_L}\\right)^{3/2}\\, \\frac{\\delta_L\\, S_L^{1/2}}{\\sqrt{\\nu L}}.\n$$\nThus, at fixed $C_\\epsilon$, the condition for maintaining $Ka$ constant while changing the ratio $u'/S_L$ is to adjust $L$ and the mixture-dependent factor $\\delta_L\\, S_L^{1/2}/\\sqrt{\\nu}$ so that the product\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{u'}{S_L}\\right)^{3/2}\\, \\frac{\\delta_L\\, S_L^{1/2}}{\\sqrt{\\nu L}}\n$$\nremains constant. Solving for $L$ yields the required scaling\n$$\nL \\propto \\left(\\frac{u'}{S_L}\\right)^3\\, \\frac{\\delta_L^2\\, S_L}{\\nu}.\n$$\n\nWe now analyze each option in light of this scaling.\n\nOption A: Hold the fuel–air mixture composition fixed so that $S_L$, $\\delta_L$, and $\\nu$ are constant. Vary $u'$ to change $u'/S_L$, and adjust the grid to set $L \\propto u'^3$. With mixture properties fixed, the factor $\\delta_L\\, S_L^{1/2}/\\sqrt{\\nu}$ is constant. The expression for $Ka$ then reduces to $Ka \\propto u'^{3/2}/\\sqrt{L}$. Choosing $L \\propto u'^3$ keeps $Ka$ constant because $u'^{3/2}/\\sqrt{u'^3} = \\text{const}$. This meets the objective with a clear physical basis: an increase in $u'$ raises the dissipation rate $\\epsilon$, which would reduce $\\tau_\\eta$, but compensating by increasing $L$ in proportion to $u'^3$ restores $\\tau_\\eta$ and thus $Ka$. This plan also ensures a sweep of $u'/S_L$ when $S_L$ is held constant. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption B: Hold $L$ fixed and vary $u'$; adjust $\\phi$ to keep $S_L$ constant. With $L$ constant and $S_L$ constant, the mixture factor $\\delta_L\\, S_L^{1/2}/\\sqrt{\\nu}$ is not strictly constant because $\\delta_L$ and $\\nu$ may vary with $\\phi$, but the option claims $S_L$ is kept constant and implies mixture properties do not change substantially. Even if we idealize $\\delta_L$ and $\\nu$ as unchanged, $Ka \\propto u'^{3/2}/\\sqrt{L}$ would still increase with $u'$. Therefore, $Ka$ does not remain approximately constant. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption C: As $u'$ increases, reduce $L$ to maintain $Re_L \\equiv u' L/\\nu$ constant, with the mixture fixed. Keeping $Re_L$ constant imposes $L \\propto \\nu/u'$. Substituting into $Ka \\propto u'^{3/2}/\\sqrt{L}$ (with mixture properties fixed), we find $Ka \\propto u'^{3/2}/\\sqrt{\\nu/u'} = u'^2/\\sqrt{\\nu}$, which increases strongly with $u'$. Thus, holding $Re_L$ constant does not control $Ka$; in fact, it exacerbates its variation. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption D: Keep $u'$ and $L$ fixed, and vary $\\phi$ to change $S_L$ and $\\delta_L$ so that $u'/S_L$ is swept. With $u'$ and $L$ fixed, $Ka \\propto \\left(u'/S_L\\right)^{3/2}\\, \\left(\\delta_L\\, S_L^{1/2}/\\sqrt{\\nu}\\right)$. As $\\phi$ changes, both $S_L$ and $\\delta_L$ change together, and $\\nu$ also changes; there is no general, robust cancellation that keeps $Ka$ constant while changing $S_L$ in a controlled way. In many mixtures, increasing $S_L$ decreases $\\delta_L$ via $\\delta_L \\approx \\alpha/S_L$, but the resulting factor $\\delta_L\\, S_L^{1/2} \\approx \\alpha\\, S_L^{-1/2}$ still varies with $S_L$, so $Ka$ varies with $\\phi$ unless $L$ and $u'$ are co-adjusted. Since $L$ and $u'$ are fixed here, $Ka$ will not remain approximately constant. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nIn summary, only Option A supplies the physically consistent scaling of $L$ with $u'$ required to keep $Ka$ constant while sweeping $u'/S_L$.\n\nAs an additional note on the Damköhler number, $Da \\equiv \\tau_t/\\tau_f \\approx (L/u') / (\\delta_L/S_L)$. Under Option A, with mixture fixed ($\\delta_L$, $S_L$ constant) and $L \\propto u'^3$, we have $Da \\propto (u'^3/u') = u'^2$, so $Da$ will change as $u'$ is swept. This is acceptable because the design objective pertains to $Ka$; the change in $Da$ highlights that holding one regime parameter constant while varying another typically requires co-adjustments of distinct flow or mixture properties.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is Option A.",

            "solution": "The objective of this problem is to analyze local combustion regimes in turbulent premixed flames using data from a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). Specifically, we are tasked with calculating the local Karlovitz number field, $Ka(\\mathbf{x})$, and identifying regions corresponding to distributed reaction zones based on physically motivated criteria. The analysis is founded on the comparison of characteristic chemical and turbulent scales.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical framework by defining the relevant local physical quantities based on the provided fields: the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{x})$, the laminar flame speed $S_{L}(\\mathbf{x})$, the laminar flame thickness $\\delta_{L}(\\mathbf{x})$, and the constant kinematic viscosity $\\nu$.\n\nThe chemical time scale, $\\tau_{F}(\\mathbf{x})$, represents the time for a laminar flame to propagate across its own thickness.

It is defined as:\n$$\n\\eta(\\mathbf{x}) = \\left(\\frac{\\nu^3}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{x})}\\right)^{1/4}\n$$\nThe units of $\\eta$ are $([L^2/T]^3 / [L^2/T^3])^{1/4} = ([L^6/T^3] / [L^2/T^3])^{1/4} = [L^4]^{1/4} = [L]$, which is meters ($\\mathrm{m}$).\n\nThe Karlovitz number, $Ka$, is a dimensionless parameter that compares the chemical time scale to the smallest turbulent time scale.

The first condition is equivalent to $Ka(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge 1$. The second condition provides an independent check on the length scales, ensuring that the flame is not spatially resolved from the smallest eddies.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n$1$. For the given input arrays $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{x})$, $S_{L}(\\mathbf{x})$, $\\delta_{L}(\\mathbf{x})$ and the scalar $\\nu$, we compute the spatial fields for the derived quantities $\\tau_{F}(\\mathbf{x})$, $\\tau_{\\eta}(\\mathbf{x})$, $\\eta(\\mathbf{x})$, and $Ka(\\mathbf{x})$ using the equations above. These computations are performed element-wise for each point on the $2 \\times 2$ grid.\n$2$. We calculate the mean Karlovitz number, $\\overline{Ka}$, by averaging the values in the computed $Ka(\\mathbf{x})$ field.\n$3$. We create a boolean mask for each of the two conditions for distributed reaction zones. The first mask is `True` where $\\tau_{F}(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge \\tau_{\\eta}(\\mathbf{x})$, and the second is `True` where $\\delta_{L}(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge \\eta(\\mathbf{x})$.\n$4$. A final boolean mask for distributed zones is obtained by applying a logical AND operation between the two condition masks.\n$5$. The fraction of grid points classified as distributed reaction zones, $f$, is calculated as the mean of this final boolean mask (where `True` is treated as $1$ and `False` as $0$).\n$6$. The two resulting metrics, $\\overline{Ka}$ and $f$, are computed for each of the three test cases ($A$, $B$, and $C$) and formatted as required.",
