All necessary models and constants are provided to determine a unique solution.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in applying the principles of Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) for a non-ideal binary mixture at the droplet surface. For a non-ideal liquid solution in equilibrium with an ideal gas mixture, the partial pressure of a component $i$ in the vapor phase, $p_{i}$, is described by the modified Raoult's law:\n$$p_{i} = \\gamma_{i} x_{i} p_{i}^{\\text{sat}}$$\nwhere $x_{i}$ is the mole fraction of species $i$ in the liquid phase, $\\gamma_{i}$ is its activity coefficient in the liquid phase, and $p_{i}^{\\text{sat}}$ is its saturation vapor pressure at the given temperature $T_{s}$.\n\nAccording to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the mole fraction of species $i$ in the vapor phase, $y_{i}$, is the ratio of its partial pressure to the total pressure $P$ of the gas mixture:\n$$y_{i} = \\frac{p_{i}}{P}$$\nCombining these two relations gives the desired expression for the interfacial vapor mole fraction of a species $i$:\n$$y_{i} = \\frac{\\gamma_{i} x_{i} p_{i}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{s})}{P}$$\nFor benzene (species $1$), this expression is:\n$$y_{1} = \\frac{\\gamma_{1} x_{1} p_{1}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{s})}{P}$$\nThis is the general expression for the benzene interfacial vapor mole fraction under non-ideal conditions.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the ratio $R$, defined as:\n$$R = \\frac{y_{1}\\ \\text{(with non-ideality)}}{y_{1}\\ \\text{(Raoult’s law)}}$$\nThe non-ideal case corresponds to $y_{1, \\text{non-ideal}} = \\frac{\\gamma_{1} x_{1} p_{1}^{\\text{sat}}}{P}$.\nThe ideal case corresponds to Raoult's law, where the liquid solution is assumed to be ideal, meaning the activity coefficient $\\gamma_{1}$ is equal to $1$. Thus, $y_{1, \\text{ideal}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot x_{1} p_{1}^{\\text{sat}}}{P}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the definition of $R$ yields a significant simplification:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{\\gamma_{1} x_{1} p_{1}^{\\text{sat}}}{P}}{\\frac{x_{1} p_{1}^{\\text{sat}}}{P}} = \\gamma_{1}$$\nTherefore, the ratio $R$ is simply the activity coefficient of benzene, $\\gamma_{1}$, at the specified liquid composition and temperature.\n\nWe calculate $\\gamma_{1}$ using the provided two-parameter symmetric Margules model:\n$$\\ln \\gamma_{1} = A x_{2}^{2}$$\nThe problem provides the constants $A = 0.12$ and the liquid-phase mole fraction of toluene $x_{2} = 0.60$.\n$$\\ln \\gamma_{1} = 0.12 \\times (0.60)^{2} = 0.12 \\times 0.36 = 0.0432$$\nFrom this, we find $\\gamma_{1}$:\n$$\\gamma_{1} = \\exp(0.0432)$$\nThis value is the required ratio $R$.\n\nAlthough not necessary for finding $R$, the problem also requests the numerical value of $y_{1}$.

The surface temperature, a critical parameter governing evaporation rates, is established by the balance between heat transferred from the hot gas and the energy consumed by vaporization. This practice explores how the excess enthalpy of mixing ($H^E$), a direct measure of the heat released or absorbed when components are mixed, enters this energy balance.

            "solution": "The problem is analyzed by applying the principle of energy conservation at the gas-liquid interface of the evaporating droplet. Under the quasi-steady assumption, the heat supplied from the hot gas stream to the droplet surface over a time interval $\\Delta t$ must balance the total enthalpy change required to vaporize the specified number of moles of each species from the liquid mixture.\n\nThe total heat supplied to the droplet surface, $Q_{in}$, is given by Newton's law of cooling:\n$$Q_{in} = h_{g} A (T_{\\infty} - T_{s}) \\Delta t$$\nwhere $h_{g}$ is the gas-side heat transfer coefficient, $A$ is the droplet surface area, $T_{\\infty}$ is the free-stream gas temperature, and $T_{s}$ is the droplet surface temperature. The surface area of the spherical droplet is $A = 4 \\pi r^{2}$.\n\nThe energy required for evaporation, $Q_{out}$, must account for the non-ideal nature of the liquid mixture. The enthalpy change to vaporize one mole of species $i$ from a liquid mixture is the difference between its molar enthalpy in the vapor phase, $h_{i,v}$, and its partial molar enthalpy in the liquid mixture, $\\bar{h}_{i,l}$. Assuming the vapor phase is an ideal gas mixture, the vapor-phase enthalpy is that of the pure component. Thus, the partial molar enthalpy of vaporization for species $i$ is:\n$$\\Delta \\bar{h}_{vap, i} = h_{i,v}(T_s) - \\bar{h}_{i,l}(x_{s}, T_s)$$\nThe partial molar enthalpy of species $i$ in a non-ideal liquid mixture is related to its pure liquid enthalpy, $h_{i,l}$, and its partial molar excess enthalpy, $\\bar{H}^{E}_{i}$, by $\\bar{h}_{i,l} = h_{i,l} + \\bar{H}^{E}_{i}$. The latent heat of vaporization of pure species $i$ is $L_{i} = h_{i,v} - h_{i,l}$. Substituting these relations, we get:\n$$\\Delta \\bar{h}_{vap, i} = (h_{i,v} - h_{i,l}) - \\bar{H}^{E}_{i} = L_{i} - \\bar{H}^{E}_{i}$$\nThe total energy required to evaporate $N_{1}$ moles of species $1$ and $N_{2}$ moles of species $2$ is the sum of the molar quantities multiplied by their respective partial molar enthalpies of vaporization:\n$$Q_{out} = N_{1} \\Delta \\bar{h}_{vap, 1} + N_{2} \\Delta \\bar{h}_{vap, 2} = N_{1}(L_{1} - \\bar{H}^{E}_{1}) + N_{2}(L_{2} - \\bar{H}^{E}_{2})$$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$Q_{out} = (N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}) - (N_{1}\\bar{H}^{E}_{1} + N_{2}\\bar{H}^{E}_{2})$$\nThe term $(N_{1}\\bar{H}^{E}_{1} + N_{2}\\bar{H}^{E}_{2})$ represents the total excess enthalpy of the evaporated moles as they existed in the liquid mixture. The partial molar excess enthalpies, $\\bar{H}^{E}_{i}$, are functions of the liquid composition at the surface, which is given as $x_{1,s} = 0.40$ (and thus $x_{2,s} = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$).\nA critical observation arises from the problem data. Let's calculate the composition of the vapor flux. The total moles evaporated are $N_{evap} = N_{1} + N_{2} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol} + 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\nThe mole fraction of species $1$ in the evaporated stream is $y_{1} = \\frac{N_{1}}{N_{evap}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-5}} = 0.40$.\nThe mole fraction of species $2$ is $y_{2} = \\frac{N_{2}}{N_{evap}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-5}} = 0.60$.\nWe find that $y_{1} = x_{1,s}$ and $y_{2} = x_{2,s}$. This means the evaporation process is congruent (azeotropic-like) at this point in time; the composition of the vapor leaving the surface is the same as the liquid composition at the surface.\nThis unforeseen simplification allows us to evaluate the excess enthalpy term. We can rewrite the term as:\n$$N_{1}\\bar{H}^{E}_{1} + N_{2}\\bar{H}^{E}_{2} = (N_{1}+N_{2})\\left(\\frac{N_{1}}{N_{1}+N_{2}}\\bar{H}^{E}_{1} + \\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}+N_{2}}\\bar{H}^{E}_{2}\\right) = N_{evap}(y_{1}\\bar{H}^{E}_{1} + y_{2}\\bar{H}^{E}_{2})$$\nSince $y_{i} = x_{i,s}$, this becomes:\n$$N_{evap}(x_{1,s}\\bar{H}^{E}_{1} + x_{2,s}\\bar{H}^{E}_{2})$$\nThe expression in the parentheses is the definition of the molar excess enthalpy of the liquid mixture, $H^{E}(x_{1,s}, T_{s})$. Therefore:\n$$N_{1}\\bar{H}^{E}_{1} + N_{2}\\bar{H}^{E}_{2} = (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $Q_{out}$:\n$$Q_{out} = (N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}) - (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}$$\nEquating heat supplied and heat consumed, $Q_{in} = Q_{out}$:\n$$h_{g} (4 \\pi r^{2}) (T_{\\infty} - T_{s}) \\Delta t = (N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}) - (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}$$\nThis is the required energy conservation statement. Solving for $T_{s}$ yields:\n$$T_{s} = T_{\\infty} - \\frac{(N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}) - (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}$$\nThis expression explicitly shows the dependence of the surface temperature $T_{s}$ on the excess enthalpy of mixing $H^{E}$.\n\nTo find the shift in surface temperature, $\\Delta T_{s}$, we compare the non-ideal case ($T_{s, \\text{non-ideal}}$) with the ideal-mixing case ($T_{s, \\text{ideal}}$), where $H^{E}=0$.\n$$T_{s, \\text{ideal}} = T_{\\infty} - \\frac{N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}$$\n$$T_{s, \\text{non-ideal}} = T_{s} = T_{\\infty} - \\frac{(N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}) - (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}$$\nThe temperature shift is $\\Delta T_{s} = T_{s, \\text{non-ideal}} - T_{s, \\text{ideal}}$:\n$$\\Delta T_{s} = \\left(T_{\\infty} - \\frac{(N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}) - (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}\\right) - \\left(T_{\\infty} - \\frac{N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta T_{s} = \\frac{-(N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}) + (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E} + (N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2})}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}$$\n$$\\Delta T_{s} = \\frac{(N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$N_{1} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$\n$N_{2} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$\n$H^{E} = -2.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$r = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$h_{g} = 4.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$\\Delta t = 5.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe numerator is:\n$$(N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-5} + 1.5 \\times 10^{-5})\\,\\mathrm{mol} \\times (-2.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}) = (2.5 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (-2.0 \\times 10^{3})\\,\\mathrm{J} = -5.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t = 4 \\pi (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2} (4.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}) (5.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s})$$\n$$= 4 \\pi (1.44 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}) (2.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}\\cdot s}) = 11.52 \\pi \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$$\n$$ \\approx 0.036191\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$$\nThe temperature shift is:\n$$\\Delta T_{s} = \\frac{-5.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{0.036191\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}} \\approx -1.38155\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the temperature shift is $-1.38\\,\\mathrm{K}$.

The model is built upon fundamental principles of thermodynamics, transport phenomena, and conservation laws.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The use of quasi-steady gas-phase equations, Raoult's law with activity coefficients for non-ideal VLE, Stefan flow (convection induced by mass transfer), and the interfacial energy balance are all standard and rigorous components of multiphase flow modeling. No scientific or factual unsoundness is present.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. The core of the per-timestep calculation is to find the interfacial temperature $T_s$. This temperature is the single variable that couples all the physics: it determines the saturation pressures $p_i^{\\mathrm{sat}}$ and activity coefficients $\\gamma_i$, which set the interfacial mole fractions $y_{i,s}$. These, in turn, serve as boundary conditions for the gas-phase transport problem, which determines the fluxes $N_i$ and $q_g$. The interfacial energy balance provides the necessary single scalar equation, $R_E(T_s) = 0$, to solve for the unknown $T_s$. This structure ensures a meaningful and unique solution can be found.\n- **Objective:** The problem is described using precise, unambiguous technical language from chemical engineering and combustion science.\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a complete, consistent, and physically sound description of a complex multiphysics problem.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Algorithmic Procedure\n\nThe central challenge is the coupling between the interfacial temperature $T_s$, the interfacial composition $y_{i,s}$, the heat flux $q_g$, and the species fluxes $N_i$.\nAt the start of a timestep $t^n$, the droplet state ($x_i^n, r^n$) is known.\nThe interfacial gas-phase mole fractions $y_{i,s}$ are functions of the liquid composition $x_i^n$ and the unknown interfacial temperature $T_s^{n+1}$ (hereafter denoted $T_s$ for simplicity within the iterative loop):\n$$y_{i,s}(T_s) = \\frac{x_i^n \\gamma_i(x_i^n, T_s) p_i^{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_s)}{P}$$\nThe gas-phase fluxes $N_i$ and $q_g$ are obtained by solving the quasi-steady, spherically-symmetric conservation equations with boundary conditions at the surface ($r=r^n$) and in the far-field ($r \\to \\infty$). These fluxes are therefore functions of the surface state, $T_s$ and $y_{i,s}$:\n$$N_i = N_i(r^n, T_s, y_{i,s}(T_s), T_\\infty, y_{i,\\infty}, P, ...)$$\n$$q_g = q_g(r^n, T_s, y_{i,s}(T_s), T_\\infty, y_{i,\\infty}, P, ...)$$\nSince $y_{i,s}$ is a function of $T_s$, all fluxes ultimately depend on the single unknown $T_s$. The value of $T_s$ is determined by the interfacial energy balance:\n$$q_g(T_s) = \\sum_{i=1}^2 N_i(T_s) h_i^{\\mathrm{lat}}(T_s)$$\nThis is a nonlinear algebraic equation for $T_s$. A robust algorithm must solve it iteratively. A standard approach is to define a residual function $R_E(T_s) = q_g(T_s) - \\sum_{i=1}^2 N_i(T_s) h_i^{\\mathrm{lat}}(T_s)$ and use a numerical root-finding method (e.g., Newton's method) to find the $T_s$ for which $R_E(T_s) = 0$.\n\nOnce the converged values $T_s^{n+1}$ and the corresponding fluxes $N_i^{n+1}$ are found, the droplet state is updated using conservation laws, typically via a forward Euler integration over the time step $\\Delta t$:\n1.  **Species Conservation:** The change in moles of species $i$, $n_i$, in the droplet is governed by evaporation: $\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = - (4\\pi r^2) N_i$.\n    $$n_i^{n+1} = n_i^n - 4\\pi (r^n)^2 N_i^{n+1} \\Delta t$$\n    The new mole fractions are $x_i^{n+1} = n_i^{n+1} / \\sum_k n_k^{n+1}$.\n2.  **Mass/Volume Conservation:** The change in droplet radius is governed by the rate of mass loss. The total mass flux is $\\sum_i N_i^{n+1} M_i$. The volume loss rate is this mass loss rate divided by the liquid density $\\rho_\\ell$.\n    $$\\frac{dV_\\ell}{dt} = 4\\pi r^2 \\frac{dr}{dt} = - \\frac{4\\pi r^2 \\sum_i N_i^{n+1} M_i}{\\rho_\\ell}$$\n    $$\\frac{dr}{dt} = - \\frac{\\sum_i N_i^{n+1} M_i}{\\rho_\\ell}$$\n    Thus, the radius update is:\n    $$r^{n+1} = r^n - \\Delta t \\left( \\frac{\\sum_i N_i^{n+1} M_i}{\\rho_\\ell(x^{n+1}, T_s^{n+1})} \\right)$$\n\nThis derived procedure serves as the benchmark for evaluating the given options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A:**\nThis option proposes an iterative procedure to find $T_s$.\n- It begins with a guess for $T_s$.\n- It correctly uses Raoult's law with activity coefficients, evaluated at the current guess for $T_s$ and the known liquid composition $x_i^n$, to find $y_{i,s}$.\n- It solves the gas-side transport problem with Stefan flow to find fluxes $N_i$ and $q_g$ consistent with the guessed interface state.\n- It defines a residual from the interfacial energy balance and iterates on $T_s$ until this residual is zero, which correctly solves the coupled problem.\n- It then uses the converged fluxes $N_i^{n+1}$ to update the droplet moles $n_i$ and mole fractions $x_i$.\n- Finally, it updates the radius $r$ based on a consistent liquid volume balance derived from mass conservation.\nThis procedure exactly matches the rigorously derived benchmark.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B:**\n- It computes $y_{i,s}$ using the bulk gas temperature, $T_\\infty$, instead of the unknown interfacial temperature, $T_s$. This violates the principle of local thermodynamic equilibrium, as VLE occurs at $T_s$.\n- It assumes zero net molar flux (no Stefan flow), which contradicts the physics of evaporation and the problem statement's requirement to include it.\n- It computes $T_s$ *after* calculating fluxes, without any iteration to ensure consistency. The final state is not a solution to the governing equations.\n- It uses a constant-$K$ $D^2$-law for the radius update, which is an oversimplification inconsistent with the detailed physics of a non-ideal, multicomponent droplet whose properties are evolving.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C:**\n- It uses the condition $y_{i,s} = x_i^n$, which has no physical basis in VLE, and assumes $T_s = T_\\infty$, which violates the energy balance by ignoring latent heat effects.\n- It neglects latent heat effects entirely, which is a violation of the first law of thermodynamics for this phase-change problem.\n- The radius update formula, $r^{n+1} = r^n - \\Delta t \\left( \\sum_i N_i \\right)$, is dimensionally inconsistent. The term $\\Delta t \\sum_i N_i$ has units of $\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}}$, not length.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D:**\n- It assumes an ideal solution ($\\gamma_i=1$), which contradicts the problem statement that the liquid is non-ideal.\n- It describes a physically incorrect mechanism for heat transfer, assuming conduction *through the liquid* driven by $T_\\infty - T_s$. The problem states the droplet is isothermal at $T_s$ and heat flux $q_g$ comes *from the gas*.\n- It neglects Stefan flow, contradicting the problem statement.\n- It fails to update the liquid composition $x_i$, which is physically incorrect as the more volatile component evaporates preferentially, changing the composition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A describes a physically consistent and algorithmically sound method for solving the problem as stated.",
