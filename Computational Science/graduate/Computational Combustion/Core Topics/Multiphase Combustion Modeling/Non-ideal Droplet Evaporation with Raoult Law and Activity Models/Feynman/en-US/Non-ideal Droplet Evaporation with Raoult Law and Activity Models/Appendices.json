All necessary models and constants are provided to determine a unique solution.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in applying the principles of Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) for a non-ideal binary mixture at the droplet surface. For a non-ideal liquid solution in equilibrium with an ideal gas mixture, the partial pressure of a component $i$ in the vapor phase, $p_{i}$, is described by the modified Raoult's law:\n$$p_{i} = \\gamma_{i} x_{i} p_{i}^{\\text{sat}}$$\nwhere $x_{i}$ is the mole fraction of species $i$ in the liquid phase, $\\gamma_{i}$ is its activity coefficient in the liquid phase, and $p_{i}^{\\text{sat}}$ is its saturation vapor pressure at the given temperature $T_{s}$.\n\nAccording to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the mole fraction of species $i$ in the vapor phase, $y_{i}$, is the ratio of its partial pressure to the total pressure $P$ of the gas mixture:\n$$y_{i} = \\frac{p_{i}}{P}$$\nCombining these two relations gives the desired expression for the interfacial vapor mole fraction of a species $i$:\n$$y_{i} = \\frac{\\gamma_{i} x_{i} p_{i}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{s})}{P}$$\nFor benzene (species $1$), this expression is:\n$$y_{1} = \\frac{\\gamma_{1} x_{1} p_{1}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{s})}{P}$$\nThis is the general expression for the benzene interfacial vapor mole fraction under non-ideal conditions.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the ratio $R$, defined as:\n$$R = \\frac{y_{1}\\ \\text{(with non-ideality)}}{y_{1}\\ \\text{(Raoult’s law)}}$$\nThe non-ideal case corresponds to $y_{1, \\text{non-ideal}} = \\frac{\\gamma_{1} x_{1} p_{1}^{\\text{sat}}}{P}$.\nThe ideal case corresponds to Raoult's law, where the liquid solution is assumed to be ideal, meaning the activity coefficient $\\gamma_{1}$ is equal to $1$.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard problem in mass transfer theory, providing sufficient information for a rigorous derivation and analysis.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for the molar evaporation flux of component $i$, denoted $N_i$. The problem specifies a model of steady, one-dimensional mass transfer across a stagnant planar gas film of thickness $\\delta$. The components in the gas phase are the evaporating species $i$ and the stagnant carrier gas $g$. The flux of species $i$ is described by the Stefan-Maxwell equations, which for a binary mixture of $i$ and $g$ simplifies to Fick's law with an advective term (Stefan flow).\n\nThe total molar flux in the direction normal to the interface, let's call it the $z$-direction, is $N = N_i + N_g$. The problem states that the carrier gas $g$ is stagnant, which implies its molar flux is zero, $N_g=0$. Therefore, the total molar flux is solely due to component $i$, so $N = N_i$.\n\nThe constitutive relation for the molar flux of species $i$ in a binary mixture is given by:\n$$\nN_i = -C D_{ig} \\frac{dy_i}{dz} + y_i (N_i + N_g)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the total molar concentration of the gas mixture, $D_{ig}$ is the binary diffusion coefficient of $i$ in $g$, and $y_i$ is the mole fraction of species $i$.\n\nSubstituting $N_g=0$, the equation becomes:\n$$\nN_i = -C D_{ig} \\frac{dy_i}{dz} + y_i N_i\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the mole fraction gradient:\n$$\nN_i (1 - y_i) = -C D_{ig} \\frac{dy_i}{dz}\n$$\nAt steady state, the species conservation equation is $\\frac{dN_i}{dz}=0$, which means $N_i$ is constant across the film. We can separate the variables $z$ and $y_i$ and integrate across the gas film, from the liquid-gas interface at $z=0$ to the edge of the film at $z=\\delta$:\n$$\n\\int_0^{\\delta} N_i dz = \\int_{y_{i,s}}^{y_{i,\\infty}} -C D_{ig} \\frac{dy_i}{1 - y_i}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are the mole fraction of $i$ at the interface, $y_i(0) = y_{i,s}$, and in the ambient gas, $y_i(\\delta) = y_{i,\\infty}$.\n\nSince $N_i$, $C$, and $D_{ig}$ are constant with respect to the spatial coordinate $z$, the integration yields:\n$$\nN_i [z]_0^{\\delta} = -C D_{ig} [-\\ln(1 - y_i)]_{y_{i,s}}^{y_{i,\\infty}}\n$$\n$$\nN_i \\delta = C D_{ig} [\\ln(1 - y_i)]_{y_{i,s}}^{y_{i,\\infty}}\n$$\n$$\nN_i \\delta = C D_{ig} (\\ln(1 - y_{i,\\infty}) - \\ln(1 - y_{i,s}))\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we get:\n$$\nN_i \\delta = C D_{ig} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - y_{i,\\infty}}{1 - y_{i,s}}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $N_i$, the molar evaporation flux of species $i$ is:\n$$\nN_i = \\frac{C D_{ig}}{\\delta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - y_{i,\\infty}}{1 - y_{i,s}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the molar flux, accounting for Stefan flow.\n\nThe next step is to evaluate the limit of this expression as the ambient gas approaches equilibrium with the interface. This condition is stated as $p_{i,\\infty} \\to p_{i,s}$, which is equivalent to $y_{i,\\infty} \\to y_{i,s}$ since $y_i = p_i/P$.

Since the natural logarithm function $\\ln(x)$ is continuous for $x > 0$, we can move the limit inside the function:\n$$\n\\lim_{y_{i,\\infty} \\to y_{i,s}} N_i = \\frac{C D_{ig}}{\\delta} \\ln\\left( \\lim_{y_{i,\\infty} \\to y_{i,s}} \\frac{1 - y_{i,\\infty}}{1 - y_{i,s}} \\right)\n$$\nEvaluating the limit inside the logarithm:\n$$\n\\lim_{y_{i,\\infty} \\to y_{i,s}} \\frac{1 - y_{i,\\infty}}{1 - y_{i,s}} = \\frac{1 - y_{i,s}}{1 - y_{i,s}} = 1\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the limiting flux:\n$$\n\\lim_{y_{i,\\infty} \\to y_{i,s}} N_i = \\frac{C D_{ig}}{\\delta} \\ln(1)\n$$\nSince $\\ln(1) = 0$, the limiting value of the molar evaporation flux is:\n$$\n\\lim_{y_{i,\\infty} \\to y_{i,s}} N_i = 0\n$$\nThis result is physically sound. The condition $y_{i,\\infty} = y_{i,s}$ signifies that the system has reached thermodynamic equilibrium. At equilibrium, the driving force for mass transfer is zero, and therefore the net flux of species $i$ must be zero. The detailed expressions for non-ideal vapor-liquid equilibrium involving $\\gamma_i$ and $x_i$ are used to determine the condition for equilibrium ($y_{i,s}$), but once that equilibrium is met by the ambient, no net process occurs.\n\nFinally, we perform the requested consistency check by specializing the result to the pure-ideal case where $x_i \\to 1$ and $\\gamma_i \\to 1$, with the total pressure approaching the saturation pressure, $P \\to P_{i}^{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_s)$. In this scenario, the interfacial mole fraction is given by:\n$$\ny_{i,s} = \\frac{\\gamma_{i} x_{i} P_{i}^{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_s)}{P}\n$$\nAs $x_i \\to 1$, $\\gamma_i \\to 1$, and $P \\to P_i^{\\text{sat}}(T_s)$, the interfacial mole fraction approaches:\n$$\ny_{i,s} \\to \\frac{(1)(1)P_{i}^{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_s)}{P_{i}^{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_s)} = 1\n$$\nThe equilibrium limit being investigated is $y_{i,\\infty} \\to y_{i,s}$, which in this special case becomes $y_{i,\\infty} \\to 1$. This physical situation describes a pure liquid at its boiling point being in contact with an ambient of its own pure vapor. This is a state of macroscopic phase equilibrium. Our general limiting result for the flux is $0$. This value is entirely consistent with this specialized equilibrium scenario, as there can be no net evaporation or condensation.\n\nThus, the limiting value of the molar evaporation flux $N_i$ as the system approaches equilibrium is zero.",

            "solution": "The problem is analyzed by applying the principle of energy conservation at the gas-liquid interface of the evaporating droplet. Under the quasi-steady assumption, the heat supplied from the hot gas stream to the droplet surface over a time interval $\\Delta t$ must balance the total enthalpy change required to vaporize the specified number of moles of each species from the liquid mixture.\n\nThe total heat supplied to the droplet surface, $Q_{in}$, is given by Newton's law of cooling:\n$$Q_{in} = h_{g} A (T_{\\infty} - T_{s}) \\Delta t$$\nwhere $h_{g}$ is the gas-side heat transfer coefficient, $A$ is the droplet surface area, $T_{\\infty}$ is the free-stream gas temperature, and $T_{s}$ is the droplet surface temperature. The surface area of the spherical droplet is $A = 4 \\pi r^{2}$.\n\nThe energy required for evaporation, $Q_{out}$, must account for the non-ideal nature of the liquid mixture. The enthalpy change to vaporize one mole of species $i$ from a liquid mixture is the difference between its molar enthalpy in the vapor phase, $h_{i,v}$, and its partial molar enthalpy in the liquid mixture, $\\bar{h}_{i,l}$. Assuming the vapor phase is an ideal gas mixture, the vapor-phase enthalpy is that of the pure component. Thus, the partial molar enthalpy of vaporization for species $i$ is:\n$$\\Delta \\bar{h}_{vap, i} = h_{i,v}(T_s) - \\bar{h}_{i,l}(x_{s}, T_s)$$\nThe partial molar enthalpy of species $i$ in a non-ideal liquid mixture is related to its pure liquid enthalpy, $h_{i,l}$, and its partial molar excess enthalpy, $\\bar{H}^{E}_{i}$, by $\\bar{h}_{i,l} = h_{i,l} + \\bar{H}^{E}_{i}$. The latent heat of vaporization of pure species $i$ is $L_{i} = h_{i,v} - h_{i,l}$.

Let's calculate the composition of the vapor flux. The total moles evaporated are $N_{evap} = N_{1} + N_{2} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol} + 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\nThe mole fraction of species $1$ in the evaporated stream is $y_{1} = \\frac{N_{1}}{N_{evap}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-5}} = 0.40$.\nThe mole fraction of species $2$ is $y_{2} = \\frac{N_{2}}{N_{evap}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-5}} = 0.60$.\nWe find that $y_{1} = x_{1,s}$ and $y_{2} = x_{2,s}$. This means the evaporation process is congruent (azeotropic-like) at this point in time; the composition of the vapor leaving the surface is the same as the liquid composition at the surface.\nThis unforeseen simplification allows us to evaluate the excess enthalpy term. We can rewrite the term as:\n$$N_{1}\\bar{H}^{E}_{1} + N_{2}\\bar{H}^{E}_{2} = (N_{1}+N_{2})\\left(\\frac{N_{1}}{N_{1}+N_{2}}\\bar{H}^{E}_{1} + \\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}+N_{2}}\\bar{H}^{E}_{2}\\right) = N_{evap}(y_{1}\\bar{H}^{E}_{1} + y_{2}\\bar{H}^{E}_{2})$$\nSince $y_{i} = x_{i,s}$, this becomes:\n$$N_{evap}(x_{1,s}\\bar{H}^{E}_{1} + x_{2,s}\\bar{H}^{E}_{2})$$\nThe expression in the parentheses is the definition of the molar excess enthalpy of the liquid mixture, $H^{E}(x_{1,s}, T_{s})$. Therefore:\n$$N_{1}\\bar{H}^{E}_{1} + N_{2}\\bar{H}^{E}_{2} = (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $Q_{out}$:\n$$Q_{out} = (N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}) - (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}$$\nEquating heat supplied and heat consumed, $Q_{in} = Q_{out}$:\n$$h_{g} (4 \\pi r^{2}) (T_{\\infty} - T_{s}) \\Delta t = (N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}) - (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}$$\nThis is the required energy conservation statement. Solving for $T_{s}$ yields:\n$$T_{s} = T_{\\infty} - \\frac{(N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}) - (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}$$\nThis expression explicitly shows the dependence of the surface temperature $T_{s}$ on the excess enthalpy of mixing $H^{E}$.\n\nTo find the shift in surface temperature, $\\Delta T_{s}$, we compare the non-ideal case ($T_{s, \\text{non-ideal}}$) with the ideal-mixing case ($T_{s, \\text{ideal}}$), where $H^{E}=0$.\n$$T_{s, \\text{ideal}} = T_{\\infty} - \\frac{N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}$$\n$$T_{s, \\text{non-ideal}} = T_{s} = T_{\\infty} - \\frac{(N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}) - (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}$$\nThe temperature shift is $\\Delta T_{s} = T_{s, \\text{non-ideal}} - T_{s, \\text{ideal}}$:\n$$\\Delta T_{s} = \\left(T_{\\infty} - \\frac{(N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}) - (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}\\right) - \\left(T_{\\infty} - \\frac{N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta T_{s} = \\frac{-(N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2}) + (N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E} + (N_{1}L_{1} + N_{2}L_{2})}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}$$\n$$\\Delta T_{s} = \\frac{(N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E}}{4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t}$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$N_{1} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$\n$N_{2} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$\n$H^{E} = -2.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$r = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$h_{g} = 4.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$\\Delta t = 5.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe numerator is:\n$$(N_{1}+N_{2})H^{E} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-5} + 1.5 \\times 10^{-5})\\,\\mathrm{mol} \\times (-2.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}) = (2.5 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (-2.0 \\times 10^{3})\\,\\mathrm{J} = -5.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$4 \\pi r^{2} h_{g} \\Delta t = 4 \\pi (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2} (4.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}) (5.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s})$$\n$$= 4 \\pi (1.44 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}) (2.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}\\cdot s}) = 11.52 \\pi \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$$\n$$ \\approx 0.036191\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$$\nThe temperature shift is:\n$$\\Delta T_{s} = \\frac{-5.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{0.036191\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}} \\approx -1.38155\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the temperature shift is $-1.38\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The negative value indicates that the surface temperature is lower for the non-ideal mixture with exothermic mixing ($H^{E}  0$), as additional energy is required to overcome the attractive forces in the liquid mixture (energy of demixing).",
