The Biot number is assumed to be small.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of heat and mass transfer. The context, biomass drying as a precursor to devolatilization, is a standard topic in combustion science. All data provided are physically plausible for a biomass particle in a high-temperature environment. The assumptions are standard for creating a tractable analytical model.\n\nTo verify the assumption of a spatially uniform temperature, the Biot number, $Bi$, is checked. The Biot number is defined as $Bi = \\frac{h L_c}{k_s}$, where $L_c$ is the characteristic length. For a sphere, $L_c = V_p / A_s = (\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3) / (\\pi d_p^2) = d_p/6$.\nGiven $d_p = 100\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $h = 300\\,\\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}$, and $k_s = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}$:\n$$L_c = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{6} \\approx 1.67 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$Bi = \\frac{(300\\,\\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}) \\times (1.67 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{0.2\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}} \\approx 0.025$$\nSince $Bi \\ll 0.1$, the assumption that internal conductive resistance is negligible compared to external convective resistance is valid. This justifies treating the particle as having a uniform temperature, which is clamped at $T_s$ during drying.\n\nThe problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and clear objectives without contradictions. The language is objective and formal.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Constant-Rate Drying Time**\n\nThe solution begins with an unsteady energy balance on the particle, which is our control mass. The fundamental principle is that the heat transferred from the hot gas to the particle is entirely consumed by the latent heat of vaporization of the water. The problem states to neglect the sensible heating of the particle.\n\nThe rate of heat transfer to the particle via convection, $\\dot{Q}_{conv}$, is given by Newton's law of cooling:\n$$\\dot{Q}_{conv} = h A_s (T_g - T_s)$$\nwhere $A_s$ is the surface area of the spherical particle, $A_s = \\pi d_p^2$.\n\nThis incoming energy drives the evaporation of water. The rate of energy consumption for vaporization is:\n$$\\dot{Q}_{evap} = \\dot{m}_{evap} L_v = \\left(-\\frac{dm_{H_2O}}{dt}\\right) L_v$$\nwhere $m_{H_2O}$ is the mass of water within the particle, and $\\dot{m}_{evap}$ is the rate of evaporation.\n\nEquating the rate of heat supply to the rate of energy consumption for phase change:\n$$h A_s (T_g - T_s) = \\left(-\\frac{dm_{H_2O}}{dt}\\right) L_v$$\nDuring the constant-rate drying period, all parameters on the left-hand side ($h$, $A_s$, $T_g$, $T_s$) are constant. This implies that the rate of mass loss of water, $\\frac{dm_{H_2O}}{dt}$, is also constant. We can therefore integrate this equation with respect to time from $t=0$ to $t=t_{dry}$, where $t_{dry}$ is the total time for drying.\n$$\\int_{m_{H_2O, initial}}^{0} dm_{H_2O} = -\\int_{0}^{t_{dry}} \\frac{h A_s (T_g - T_s)}{L_v} dt$$\n$$-m_{H_2O, initial} = -\\frac{h A_s (T_g - T_s)}{L_v} t_{dry}$$\nSolving for the drying time, $t_{dry}$:\n$$t_{dry} = \\frac{m_{H_2O, initial} L_v}{h A_s (T_g - T_s)}$$\nThe initial mass of water, $m_{H_2O, initial}$, must be determined. The total initial mass of the wet particle is $m_{p,total} = \\rho_p V_p$, where $V_p$ is the particle volume, $V_p = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3$.\n$$m_{p,total} = \\rho_p \\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3$$\nThe initial mass of water is given by the wet-basis moisture fraction, $X_w$:\n$$m_{H_2O, initial} = X_w m_{p,total} = X_w \\rho_p \\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $m_{H_2O, initial}$ and $A_s$ into the equation for $t_{dry}$:\n$$t_{dry} = \\frac{\\left(X_w \\rho_p \\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3\\right) L_v}{h (\\pi d_p^2) (T_g - T_s)}$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling terms ($\\pi$ and $d_p^2$):\n$$t_{dry} = \\frac{X_w \\rho_p d_p L_v}{6 h (T_g - T_s)}$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the constant-rate drying time.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe now substitute the provided numerical values into the derived expression. All values must be in base SI units.\n- $X_w = 0.10$\n- $\\rho_p = 600\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$\n- $d_p = 100\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $L_v = 2.26 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{J/kg}$\n- $h = 300\\,\\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}$\n- $T_g = 1000\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $T_s = 373\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\n$$t_{dry} = \\frac{(0.10) \\times (600\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (2.26 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{J/kg})}{6 \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}) \\times (1000\\,\\mathrm{K} - 373\\,\\mathrm{K})}$$\n$$t_{dry} = \\frac{0.10 \\times 600 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\times 2.26 \\times 10^6}{1800 \\times 627}$$\n$$t_{dry} = \\frac{13560}{1128600}\\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.01201488\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the drying time is $0.0120\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n**Interpretation of Devolatilization Delay**\nThe model assumes that during the entire drying period of $t_{dry} \\approx 0.0120\\,\\mathrm{s}$, the particle's temperature is held constant at the water boiling point, $T_s = 373\\,\\mathrm{K}$ ($100^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$). Devolatilization, the process of thermal decomposition of biomass solids, requires significantly higher temperatures, typically initiating around $500 - 600\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nTherefore, the drying process creates a thermal plateau at $373\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Only after all the moisture has evaporated can the particle temperature begin to rise from $373\\,\\mathrm{K}$ toward the ambient gas temperature $T_g$. The time required to dry the particle, $t_{dry}$, represents a direct delay before the particle can be heated to the temperatures necessary for devolatilization to commence. Based on this physical reasoning, the drying phase significantly delays the onset of devolatilization.",

External Convective Heating Timescale ($\\tau_{\\text{conv}}$)**\nThis timescale represents the characteristic time for the particle's bulk temperature to change due to heat exchange with the surrounding gas. Applying the principle of conservation of energy to the particle, we can formulate a lumped-capacitance model. The rate of change of the particle's internal energy is equal to the rate of convective heat transfer at its surface.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} (\\rho_s V c_{p,s} T_p) = h A_s (T - T_p) $$\nwhere $V$ is the particle volume, $A_s$ is the particle surface area, and $T_p$ is the particle temperature. For a sphere, $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ and $A_s = 4\\pi R^2$. Assuming constant properties, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\rho_s \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\\right) c_{p,s} \\frac{dT_p}{dt} = h (4\\pi R^2) (T - T_p) $$\nRearranging this first-order ordinary differential equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{dT_p}{dt} = \\frac{h (4\\pi R^2)}{\\rho_s c_{p,s} (\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3)} (T - T_p) = \\frac{3h}{\\rho_s c_{p,s} R} (T - T_p) $$\nThis equation is of the form $\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\tau}(y_\\infty - y)$, where the characteristic time constant is $\\tau$. Thus, the timescale for convective heating is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{conv}} = \\frac{\\rho_s c_{p,s} R}{3h} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{conv}} = \\frac{(600\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}})(1500\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{3(400\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}})} = \\frac{180}{1200}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n\n**2. Internal Conductive Heating Timescale ($\\tau_{\\text{cond}}$)**\nThis timescale characterizes the time required for heat to diffuse from the surface to the center of the particle. The governing first principle is the heat diffusion (Fourier's) equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T_p}{\\partial t} = \\alpha_s \\nabla^2 T_p $$\nwhere $\\alpha_s = \\frac{k_s}{\\rho_s c_{p,s}}$ is the thermal diffusivity of the solid. From dimensional analysis of this equation, the characteristic time $\\tau$ for diffusion over a length scale $L$ is $\\tau \\sim L^2/\\alpha_s$. For our spherical particle, the characteristic length scale is its radius $R$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{cond}} = \\frac{R^2}{\\alpha_s} = \\frac{R^2 \\rho_s c_{p,s}}{k_s} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{cond}} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 (600\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}})(1500\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})}{0.12\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}} = \\frac{(4.0 \\times 10^{-8})(9.0 \\times 10^5)}{0.12}\\,\\mathrm{s} = \\frac{0.036}{0.12}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n\n**3. Primary Pyrolysis Reaction Timescale ($\\tau_{\\text{chem}}$)**\nThis timescale is the characteristic time for the pyrolysis reaction to occur. The problem states the reaction is first-order. The rate of consumption of the solid reactant (biomass), $m_s$, is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dm_s}{dt} = -k(T) m_s $$\nThis is a first-order decay process, for which the characteristic time is the inverse of the rate constant, $k(T)$.

Intraparticle Volatiles Diffusion Timescale ($\\tau_{\\text{diff}}$)**\nThis timescale represents the time required for the volatile products of pyrolysis to diffuse out of the porous particle. The governing principle is Fick's second law of diffusion for the concentration of volatiles, $C_v$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial t} = D_{\\text{eff}} \\nabla^2 C_v $$\nThis equation is mathematically analogous to the heat equation. By dimensional analysis, the characteristic time for diffusion over a length scale $L$ is $\\tau \\sim L^2/D_{\\text{eff}}$. Using the particle radius $R$ as the characteristic length:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{diff}} = \\frac{R^2}{D_{\\text{eff}}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{diff}} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.040\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n\n**Classification of the Controlling Mechanism**\nTo identify the controlling mechanism, we compare the four calculated timescales. The controlling (or rate-limiting) process is the one with the largest characteristic time.\n- $\\tau_{\\text{conv}} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{s}$ (External heating)\n- $\\tau_{\\text{cond}} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}$ (Internal heating)\n- $\\tau_{\\text{chem}} \\approx 0.0185\\,\\mathrm{s}$ (Chemical reaction)\n- $\\tau_{\\text{diff}} = 0.040\\,\\mathrm{s}$ (Volatile diffusion)\n\nComparing these values:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{chem}}  \\tau_{\\text{diff}}  \\tau_{\\text{conv}}  \\tau_{\\text{cond}} $$\nThe largest timescale is $\\tau_{\\text{cond}} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}$. This signifies that the rate of heat conduction into the particle's interior is the slowest process among the four. Therefore, the overall rate of devolatilization is controlled by internal heat transfer. The chemical reaction is very rapid at this temperature, and the escape of volatiles is also significantly faster than the heating processes.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the dominant (largest) timescale, rounded to four significant figures.\nThe largest timescale is $\\tau_{\\text{cond}} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}$. Expressed to four significant figures, this is $0.3000\\,\\mathrm{s}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and numerical solution of a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the devolatilization of a single coal particle. The particle is modeled as a lumped-capacitance system, meaning its internal temperature is assumed to be spatially uniform.\n\nWe begin by formulating the governing equations based on the fundamental principles provided. Let the state of the system at time $t$ be described by the vector $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [T_p(t), X(t)]^T$, where $T_p(t)$ is the particle temperature and $X(t)$ is the volatile conversion fraction.\n\nThe first governing equation is derived from the First Law of Thermodynamics for a control mass with uniform temperature $T_p$. The rate of change of the particle's internal energy is equal to the net rate of heat addition and the energy effect of the chemical reaction (pyrolysis). This is given as:\n$$m c_p \\frac{dT_p}{dt} = q_\\mathrm{conv} + \\dot{m}_v \\Delta H_\\mathrm{py}$$\nwhere $m$ is the particle mass, $c_p$ is its specific heat capacity, $q_\\mathrm{conv}$ is the convective heat transfer rate, $\\dot{m}_v$ is the mass rate of volatile release, and $\\Delta H_\\mathrm{py}$ is the specific enthalpy of pyrolysis.\n\nThe convective heat transfer follows Newton's law of cooling:\n$$q_\\mathrm{conv} = h A (T_g - T_p)$$\nwhere $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, $A$ is the particle surface area, and $T_g$ is the constant ambient gas temperature.\n\nThe rate of volatile mass release is related to the conversion rate $\\frac{dX}{dt}$ by:\n$$\\dot{m}_v = m_{v,0} \\frac{dX}{dt}$$\nwhere $m_{v,0}$ is the initial mass of volatiles in the particle, given by $m_{v,0} = f_v m$, with $f_v$ being the initial volatile mass fraction.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the energy balance gives:\n$$m c_p \\frac{dT_p}{dt} = h A (T_g - T_p) + \\left(f_v m \\frac{dX}{dt}\\right) \\Delta H_\\mathrm{py}$$\nTo obtain the ODE for $T_p$, we divide by $m c_p$:\n$$\\frac{dT_p}{dt} = \\frac{h A}{m c_p} (T_g - T_p) + \\frac{f_v \\Delta H_\\mathrm{py}}{c_p} \\frac{dX}{dt}$$\nFor a spherical particle of radius $r$ and density $\\rho_p$, the mass is $m = \\rho_p V = \\rho_p (\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3)$ and the surface area is $A = 4 \\pi r^2$. The surface-area-to-mass ratio is therefore:\n$$\\frac{A}{m} = \\frac{4 \\pi r^2}{\\rho_p \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3} = \\frac{3}{\\rho_p r}$$\nSubstituting this ratio, the first ODE becomes:\n$$\\frac{dT_p}{dt} = \\frac{3 h}{r \\rho_p c_p} (T_g - T_p) + \\frac{f_v \\Delta H_\\mathrm{py}}{c_p} \\frac{dX}{dt}$$\n\nThe second governing equation describes the evolution of the volatile conversion $X$. It is given directly by the first-order Arrhenius kinetics model:\n$$\\frac{dX}{dt} = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{R T_p}\\right) (1 - X)$$\nwhere $k_0$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E$ is the activation energy, and $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n\nBy substituting the expression for $\\frac{dX}{dt}$ into the equation for $\\frac{dT_p}{dt}$, we obtain the final coupled system of ODEs:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dT_p}{dt} = \\frac{3 h}{r \\rho_p c_p} (T_g - T_p) + \\left( \\frac{f_v \\Delta H_\\mathrm{py}}{c_p} \\right) \\left[ k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{R T_p}\\right) (1 - X) \\right] \\\\\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{R T_p}\\right) (1 - X)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is an initial value problem with initial conditions $T_p(0) = T_{p,0}$ and $X(0) = 0$.\n\nThis system is solved numerically over the time interval $t \\in [0, t^\\ast]$ using a suitable ODE integrator, such as the `solve_ivp` function from the `scipy.integrate` library, which can handle the potential stiffness arising from the exponential dependence on temperature.\n\nUpon obtaining the solution $T_p(t^\\ast)$ at the specified time $t^\\ast = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{s}$, we compute the required quantities.\nThe temperature lag is calculated as:\n$$\\Delta T(t^\\ast) = T_g - T_p(t^\\ast)$$\nThe rate ratio $\\mathcal{R}(t^\\ast)$ compares the devolatilization rate at the particle temperature $T_p(t^\\ast)$ to the rate at the gas temperature $T_g$. It is defined as:\n$$\\mathcal{R}(t^\\ast) = \\frac{k(T_p(t^\\ast))}{k(T_g)} = \\frac{k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{R T_p(t^\\ast)}\\right)}{k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{R T_g}\\right)}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\mathcal{R}(t^\\ast) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_p(t^\\ast)} - \\frac{1}{T_g}\\right)\\right)$$\nThis simplified form is numerically more stable and is used in the implementation. The program iterates through each test case, solves the ODE system, calculates $\\Delta T(t^\\ast)$ and $\\mathcal{R}(t^\\ast)$, and collates the results into the specified output format.",
