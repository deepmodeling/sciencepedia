It represents a standard problem in transient heat conduction and is free of any invalidating flaws.\n\nThe temperature field $T_{\\ell}(r,t)$ within the spherical liquid droplet is governed by the principle of energy conservation. In spherical coordinates, assuming the temperature depends only on the radial coordinate $r$ and time $t$ (due to the specified symmetry) and in the absence of internal heat generation, the heat diffusion equation is:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\ell} c_{p,\\ell} \\frac{\\partial T_{\\ell}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 k_{\\ell} \\frac{\\partial T_{\\ell}}{\\partial r} \\right)\n$$\nGiven that the liquid properties $\\rho_{\\ell}$, $c_{p,\\ell}$, and $k_{\\ell}$ are constant, we can rewrite this equation using the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha_{\\ell} = k_{\\ell}/(\\rho_{\\ell} c_{p,\\ell})$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T_{\\ell}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\alpha_{\\ell}}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{\\partial T_{\\ell}}{\\partial r} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the governing transient heat equation for the liquid phase.\n\nThe boundary conditions for this equation are as follows:\n$1$.

At the surface of the droplet, $r=R$, the heat conducted from the liquid interior to the surface must balance the heat convected from the hot gas to the surface. This is an energy balance expressed using Fourier's law for conduction and Newton's law of cooling for convection:\n$$\n-k_{\\ell} \\left. \\frac{\\partial T_{\\ell}}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=R} = h_{g} (T_{g} - T_{\\ell}(R, t))\n$$\n\nTo non-dimensionalize the problem, we introduce the following dimensionless variables.

At $r=R$ (which corresponds to $\\eta=1$):\n$$\n-k_{\\ell} \\left. \\frac{1}{R} \\frac{\\partial (\\Theta(T_g - T_0) + T_0)}{\\partial \\eta} \\right|_{\\eta=1} = h_{g} (T_{g} - (\\Theta(1,\\tau)(T_g-T_0) + T_0))\n$$\n$$\n-k_{\\ell} \\frac{T_g-T_0}{R} \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\Theta}{\\partial \\eta} \\right|_{\\eta=1} = h_{g} (T_g - T_0 - \\Theta(1,\\tau)(T_g-T_0))\n$$\n$$\n-k_{\\ell} \\frac{T_g-T_0}{R} \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\Theta}{\\partial \\eta} \\right|_{\\eta=1} = h_{g} (T_g - T_0) (1 - \\Theta(1,\\tau))\n$$\nCanceling the term $(T_g-T_0)$ and rearranging, we obtain the non-dimensional boundary condition at the surface:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial \\Theta}{\\partial \\eta} \\right|_{\\eta=1} = -\\frac{h_{g} R}{k_{\\ell}} (1 - \\Theta(1,\\tau))\n$$\nThe single dimensionless group multiplying the boundary condition is $\\frac{h_{g} R}{k_{\\ell}}$. This is the Biot number, denoted $Bi$.\n\nTo interpret this group physically, we perform an order-of-magnitude analysis to find the ratio of internal and external time scales.\nThe characteristic time for heat to diffuse across the droplet radius $R$ is the internal diffusion time scale, $\\tau_{diff}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{diff} \\sim \\frac{R^2}{\\alpha_{\\ell}} = \\frac{R^2 \\rho_{\\ell} c_{p,\\ell}}{k_{\\ell}}\n$$\nThe characteristic time for the droplet's thermal energy to change due to external convection is the external convection time scale, $\\tau_{conv}$.

The Biot number can thus be physically interpreted as the ratio of the internal (liquid-side) resistance to conduction to the external (gas-side) resistance to convection, or equivalently, as the ratio of the characteristic time for internal heat diffusion to the characteristic time for external heat convection.\n\nBased on this ratio, two distinct heating regimes can be identified:\n$1$. **Nearly uniform internal temperature ($Bi \\ll 1$)**: When the Biot number is small, $\\tau_{diff} \\ll \\tau_{conv}$. Heat diffuses within the droplet much faster than it is supplied from the gas. Consequently, any internal temperature gradients are quickly smoothed out, and the droplet's temperature is spatially uniform, $T_{\\ell}(r,t) \\approx T_{\\ell}(t)$. This is the \"thermally thin\" or \"lumped capacitance\" regime.\n$2$. **Strongly non-uniform internal temperature ($Bi \\gg 1$)**: When the Biot number is large, $\\tau_{diff} \\gg \\tau_{conv}$. Heat is supplied to the surface much faster than it can be conducted into the interior. This leads to the buildup of large temperature gradients, with the surface being significantly hotter than the center. This is the \"thermally thick\" or \"conduction limited\" regime, where the full partial differential equation must be solved.\n\nThe order-of-magnitude boundary between these two regimes occurs when the time scales (or thermal resistances) are comparable, which is at $Bi \\sim 1$. In practical engineering analysis, the lumped capacitance approximation is often considered valid for $Bi < 0.1$.\n\nThe final expression requested is the non-dimensional group that quantifies the ratio of internal diffusion and external convection time scales, simplified to involve only $h_{g}$, $R$, and $k_{\\ell}$.

            "solution": "The problem is analyzed by first establishing the governing physical principles and mathematical formulation, followed by a time-scale analysis to justify the necessary approximations for the short-time regime.\n\nThe conservation of energy for transient heat conduction in a spherically symmetric medium with constant properties is described by the heat equation in spherical coordinates. For the temperature $T(r,t)$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate and $t$ is time, the equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha_{\\ell} \\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^{2} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{\\ell} = k_{\\ell}/(\\rho_{\\ell} c_{\\ell})$ is the thermal diffusivity of the liquid, $k_{\\ell}$ is the thermal conductivity, $\\rho_{\\ell}$ is the density, and $c_{\\ell}$ is the specific heat capacity.\n\nThe problem is defined by the following initial and boundary conditions:\n1.  Initial condition (uniform temperature): $T(r, t=0) = T_{0}$ for $0 \\le r \\le R$.\n2.  Boundary condition at the center (symmetry): $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}|_{r=0} = 0$ for $t > 0$.\n3.  Boundary condition at the surface (convective heating): $-k_{\\ell} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}|_{r=R} = h_{g} (T(r=R, t) - T_{g,1})$ for $t > 0$, where $T_{g,1} = T_{0} + \\Delta T_{g}$.\n\n**Part 1: Physical Explanation for the Temperature Difference**\n\nThe core of the physical explanation lies in the finite rate of heat propagation within the droplet. The thermal conductivity, $k_{\\ell}$, being finite means that heat does not transfer instantaneously from one point to another. The process of heat transfer is diffusive, governed by the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha_{\\ell}$.\n\nAt time $t=0^{+}$, the external gas temperature is instantaneously raised to $T_{g,1}$, creating a temperature difference across the droplet surface. This initiates a heat flux into the droplet at its surface, $r=R$. The heat entering the droplet begins to raise the temperature of the liquid layer immediately adjacent to the surface.\n\nThis thermal \"signal\" or wave propagates inward from the surface via conduction. The characteristic time scale for this thermal wave to diffuse across the entire droplet radius $R$ is the diffusion time, $\\tau_{D} = R^{2}/\\alpha_{\\ell}$. The problem specifically considers the initial stage, where $t \\ll \\tau_{D}$.\n\nIn this short-time regime, the thermal penetration depth, which scales as $\\delta_{T} \\sim \\sqrt{\\alpha_{\\ell} t}$, is much smaller than the droplet radius $R$. That is, $\\sqrt{\\alpha_{\\ell} t} \\ll R$. This means that the heating effect is confined to a very thin layer near the surface of the droplet. The bulk of the droplet's interior, and most significantly its center at $r=0$, has not yet experienced a significant temperature change. The center temperature, $T_{c}(t) = T(r=0,t)$, therefore remains approximately equal to the initial temperature, $T_{c}(t) \\approx T_{0}$.\n\nIn contrast, the surface temperature, $T_{s}(t) = T(r=R,t)$, begins to rise immediately due to the continuous heat flux from the surrounding hot gas. Since $T_{s}(t)$ is increasing while $T_{c}(t)$ has not yet begun to rise, it is a direct consequence that $T_{s}(t) > T_{c}(t)$. Thus, during the initial stage, the center of the droplet remains colder than its surface.\n\n**Part 2: Leading-Order Derivation of the Center-Surface Temperature Difference**\n\nTo derive an analytical expression for $\\Delta T_{cs}(t) = T_{s}(t) - T_{c}(t)$, we formalize the short-time argument. As established, for $t \\ll R^{2}/\\alpha_{\\ell}$, the thermal penetration depth is small, $\\delta_{T} \\ll R$. In this limit, the curvature of the droplet surface is negligible from the perspective of the thin thermal boundary layer. The heat transfer process can be accurately modeled as conduction into a semi-infinite solid, where the spherical geometry is approximated by a planar one.\n\nLet us define a new coordinate $x = R - r$, which represents the depth into the droplet from the surface. The surface is at $x=0$ and the center is at $x=R$. The semi-infinite approximation corresponds to letting the domain be $x \\in [0, \\infty)$. The heat equation in spherical coordinates simplifies to the one-dimensional planar heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha_{\\ell} \\frac{\\partial^{2} T}{\\partial x^{2}}\n$$\nLet's define a shifted temperature $\\theta(x, t) = T(x, t) - T_{0}$. The problem becomes:\n1.  PDE: $\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\alpha_{\\ell} \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\theta}{\\partial x^{2}}$ for $x>0, t>0$.\n2.  IC: $\\theta(x, 0) = 0$.\n3.  BC at the surface ($x=0$): The heat flux condition is $-k_{\\ell} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}|_{r=R} = k_{\\ell} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}|_{x=0} = k_{\\ell} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x}|_{x=0}$. This must equal the convective heat flux, $h_{g}(T_{s} - T_{g,1}) = h_{g}(\\theta_{s} - \\Delta T_{g})$. So, $k_{\\ell} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x}|_{x=0} = h_{g}(\\theta(0,t) - \\Delta T_{g})$.\n4.  BC deep inside ($x \\to \\infty$): $\\theta(\\infty, t) = 0$.\n\nThis is a standard problem in transient heat conduction. The solution for the temperature field $\\theta(x,t)$ is well-known:\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta(x,t)}{\\Delta T_{g}} = \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha_{\\ell} t}}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{h_{g}x}{k_{\\ell}} + \\frac{h_{g}^{2}\\alpha_{\\ell}t}{k_{\\ell}^{2}}\\right) \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha_{\\ell} t}} + \\frac{h_{g}\\sqrt{\\alpha_{\\ell}t}}{k_{\\ell}}\\right)\n$$\nWe need the surface temperature, $\\theta_{s}(t) = \\theta(x=0, t)$.

Let $z = \\frac{h_{g}\\sqrt{\\alpha_{\\ell}t}}{k_{\\ell}}$. The condition $t \\to 0$ implies $z \\to 0$. We use the Taylor series expansions for small $z$:\n$$\n\\exp(z^{2}) \\approx 1 + z^{2} + O(z^{4})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{erfc}(z) = 1 - \\text{erf}(z) = 1 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\left(z - \\frac{z^3}{3} + \\dots \\right) \\approx 1 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}z + O(z^{3})\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\theta_{s}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta_{s}(t)}{\\Delta T_{g}} \\approx 1 - \\left(1 + z^{2}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}z\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta_{s}(t)}{\\Delta T_{g}} \\approx 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}z + z^{2} - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}z^{3}\\right)\n$$\nKeeping only the lowest-order term in $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta_{s}(t)}{\\Delta T_{g}} \\approx \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}z\n$$\nSubstituting back the expression for $z$:\n$$\n\\theta_{s}(t) \\approx \\Delta T_{g} \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left(\\frac{h_{g}\\sqrt{\\alpha_{\\ell}t}}{k_{\\ell}}\\right) = \\frac{2 h_{g} \\Delta T_{g}}{k_{\\ell}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_{\\ell} t}{\\pi}}\n$$\nThis is the leading-order expression for the surface temperature rise, $T_{s}(t) - T_{0}$.\n\nAs argued physically, for $t \\ll R^{2}/\\alpha_{\\ell}$, the center temperature remains at its initial value to leading order, $T_{c}(t) \\approx T_{0}$. Therefore, the center-surface temperature difference is:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{cs}(t) = T_{s}(t) - T_{c}(t) \\approx (T_{0} + \\theta_{s}(t)) - T_{0} = \\theta_{s}(t)\n$$\nThus, the leading-order estimate for the center-surface temperature difference is:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{cs}(t) = \\frac{2 h_{g} \\Delta T_{g}}{k_{\\ell}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_{\\ell} t}{\\pi}}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $t \\ll R^{2}/\\alpha_{\\ell}$ and provides the temperature difference in kelvins, as requested, since all quantities on the right-hand side are in a consistent set of base SI units.",

This relation must be enforced only where $h_{lv}(T_s) > 0$.\n- The surface equilibrium vapor mass fraction is computed from ideal-gas equilibrium using the saturation pressure $p_{sat}(T_s)$ and molecular weights:\n$$\np_{sat}(T_s) = p_{ref} \\exp\\left( \\frac{\\Delta H_{mol}(T_s)}{R_u} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{ref}} - \\frac{1}{T_s} \\right) \\right),\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H_{mol}(T_s) = h_{lv}(T_s) \\, M_v,\n$$\n$$\nY_s(T_s) = \\frac{M_v \\, p_{sat}(T_s)}{M_v \\, p_{sat}(T_s) + M_a \\left( p_{tot} - p_{sat}(T_s) \\right)},\n$$\nwhere $R_u$ is the universal gas constant, $M_v$ the vapor molecular weight, $M_a$ the air molecular weight, $p_{ref}$ the saturation pressure at $T_{ref}$, and $p_{tot}$ the total pressure.\n\nCoupling and iterative solution requirement:\n- The physically correct mass flux $j$ must satisfy both the mass transfer relation and the energy balance simultaneously. Define the residual\n$$\nF(T_s; \\overline{T}) \\equiv j_m(T_s) - \\frac{q_g(T_s) - q_{int}(T_s, \\overline{T})}{h_{lv}(T_s)}.\n$$\n- For a given $R$ and instantaneous $\\overline{T}$, find $T_s$ such that $F(T_s; \\overline{T}) = 0$ using a robust one-dimensional root-finding method. This is the required iterative coupling step, and it is necessary because $h_{lv}(T_s)$ appears nonlinearly in both the numerator and denominator via $p_{sat}(T_s)$ and $h_{lv}(T_s)$.\n\nAfter obtaining $T_s$ and $j$, compute $K$ via the $d^2$-law definition above. For this task, treat $\\overline{T}$ as the initial liquid temperature $T_0$ (quasi-steady surface adjustment relative to internal heating over a short timescale), and evaluate the instantaneous $K$ at the initial radius $R_0$.\n\nUnits and output requirements:\n- All inputs are in SI units. Report the evaporation constants $K$ for the specified test cases in $\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ as decimal floats.\n- Angle units are not involved.\n- The final program must output a single line: a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, e.g., \"[result1,result2,result3]\".\n\nTest suite:\nUse the following three parameter sets to evaluate $K$ at $R=R_0$ and $\\overline{T}=T_0$.\n- Case A (general \"happy path\"):\n    - $R_0 = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\, \\mathrm{m}$, $\\rho_\\ell = 700\\, \\mathrm{kg}\\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $c_\\ell = 2200\\, \\mathrm{J}\\cdot \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $k_\\ell = 0.14\\, \\mathrm{W}\\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$,\n    - $k_g = 0.06\\, \\mathrm{W}\\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $D_g = 8.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\, \\mathrm{m}^2\\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $\\rho_g = 0.70\\, \\mathrm{kg}\\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$,\n    - $Nu = 2.0$, $Sh = 2.0$, $T_\\infty = 800\\, \\mathrm{K}$, $T_0 = 300\\, \\mathrm{K}$,\n    - $h_{lv,ref} = 3.5 \\times 10^{5}\\, \\mathrm{J}\\cdot \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$, $\\gamma = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\, \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $T_{ref} = 300\\, \\mathrm{K}$,\n    - $p_{tot} = 101325\\, \\mathrm{Pa}$, $p_{ref} = 7000\\, \\mathrm{Pa}$, $M_v = 1.002 \\times 10^{-1}\\, \\mathrm{kg}\\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, $M_a = 2.897 \\times 10^{-2}\\, \\mathrm{kg}\\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, $R_u = 8.314462618\\, \\mathrm{J}\\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $Y_\\infty = 0$.\n- Case B (boundary condition approaching infinite conductivity):\n    - Same as Case A but with $k_\\ell = 1.0\\, \\mathrm{W}\\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ and $\\gamma = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\, \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n- Case C (edge case with low conductivity and stronger temperature dependence of latent heat):\n    - Same as Case A but with $k_\\ell = 0.05\\, \\mathrm{W}\\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ and $\\gamma = 8.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\, \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[resultA,resultB,resultC]\"), where each result is the float value of $K$ in $\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ for the corresponding case, computed by solving $F(T_s; \\overline{T})=0$ iteratively for $T_s$ and then evaluating $K$ at $R=R_0$ and $\\overline{T}=T_0$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and is determined to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of computational combustion. It is self-contained, with all necessary physical relations, parameters, and a clear objective. There are no scientific or logical contradictions. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the instantaneous evaporation constant, $K$, for a spherical liquid fuel droplet. The model incorporates two key physical phenomena that extend the classical simple $d^2$-law: finite thermal conductivity within the droplet and a temperature-dependent latent heat of vaporization. The evaporation constant is defined by the rate of change of the droplet's surface area, which is directly proportional to the mass evaporation flux $j$ at the surface:\n$$\nK = -\\frac{d(4R^2)}{dt} = \\frac{8 R}{\\rho_\\ell} j\n$$\nHere, $R$ is the instantaneous droplet radius and $\\rho_\\ell$ is the constant liquid density. To find $K$ at a specific instant, we must determine the value of $j$. The problem specifies that this calculation should be performed at the initial state, where the radius is $R_0$ and the liquid-averaged temperature $\\overline{T}$ is the initial temperature $T_0$.\n\nThe mass flux $j$ is governed by two coupled physical processes at the droplet surface: mass transfer from the surface to the ambient gas and the energy balance at the interface.\n\nFirst, mass transfer is driven by the concentration gradient of fuel vapor between the droplet surface and the far-field. According to the stagnant film model provided:\n$$\nj_m(T_s) = \\rho_g \\, k_m \\left( Y_s(T_s) - Y_\\infty \\right)\n$$\nThe mass transfer coefficient $k_m$ is given by $k_m = \\frac{Sh \\, D_g}{2R}$, where $Sh$ is the Sherwood number and $D_g$ is the gas-phase diffusivity. For this problem, $Y_\\infty = 0$. The surface vapor mass fraction, $Y_s(T_s)$, is a strong function of the surface temperature $T_s$ and is determined by phase equilibrium. This dependency is highly nonlinear and is modeled via the Clausius-Clapeyron relation for saturation pressure $p_{sat}(T_s)$:\n$$\np_{sat}(T_s) = p_{ref} \\exp\\left( \\frac{\\Delta H_{mol}(T_s)}{R_u} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{ref}} - \\frac{1}{T_s} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta H_{mol}(T_s) = h_{lv}(T_s) \\, M_v$. The vapor mass fraction is then:\n$$\nY_s(T_s) = \\frac{M_v \\, p_{sat}(T_s)}{M_v \\, p_{sat}(T_s) + M_a \\left( p_{tot} - p_{sat}(T_s) \\right)}\n$$\nCrucially, the latent heat of vaporization, $h_{lv}(T_s)$, also depends on temperature:\n$$\nh_{lv}(T_s) = h_{lv,ref} \\left[ 1 - \\gamma \\left( T_s - T_{ref} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis introduces a complex, implicit dependence of the mass flux $j_m$ on $T_s$.\n\nSecond, the energy balance at the droplet surface dictates how the incoming heat from the hot gas is partitioned. The heat flux from the gas to the surface is $q_g(T_s) = h_g (T_\\infty - T_s)$, where $h_g = \\frac{Nu \\, k_g}{2R}$ is the gas-side heat transfer coefficient. This heat is consumed by two processes: providing the latent heat for vaporization, $j \\cdot h_{lv}(T_s)$, and conducting heat into the droplet's interior, $q_{int}(T_s, \\overline{T})$. The internal heat flux is modeled as $q_{int}(T_s, \\overline{T}) = h_{int} (T_s - \\overline{T})$, with the internal heat transfer coefficient given by $h_{int} = \\frac{3 k_{\\ell}}{R}$. The energy conservation equation is:\n$$\nq_g(T_s) = j \\cdot h_{lv}(T_s) + q_{int}(T_s, \\overline{T})\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to provide an independent expression for the mass flux, which we can denote as $j_e$:\n$$\nj_e(T_s, \\overline{T}) = \\frac{q_g(T_s) - q_{int}(T_s, \\overline{T})}{h_{lv}(T_s)}\n$$\n\nFor a physically consistent solution, the mass flux must be unique. Therefore, the value derived from mass transfer must equal the value derived from the energy balance: $j_m(T_s) = j_e(T_s, \\overline{T})$. This equality establishes a single, nonlinear algebraic equation for the unknown surface temperature $T_s$. To solve for $T_s$, we define a residual function $F(T_s; \\overline{T})$ whose root corresponds to the solution:\n$$\nF(T_s; \\overline{T}) \\equiv j_m(T_s) - j_e(T_s, \\overline{T}) = j_m(T_s) - \\frac{q_g(T_s) - q_{int}(T_s, \\overline{T})}{h_{lv}(T_s)} = 0\n$$\nAll terms in this equation are functions of $T_s$ and known parameters. The parameters for the analysis are set to their initial values: $R = R_0$ and $\\overline{T} = T_0$.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure to compute $K$ for each test case is as follows:\n1.  For a given set of parameters $\\{R_0, T_0, \\rho_{\\ell}, k_{\\ell}, \\dots \\}$, define all constituent functions: $h_{lv}(T_s)$, $p_{sat}(T_s)$, $Y_s(T_s)$, $j_m(T_s)$, $q_g(T_s)$, and $q_{int}(T_s)$. These functions implicitly depend on the fixed parameters of the specific case.\n2.  Construct the residual function $F(T_s) = F(T_s; T_0)$.\n3.  Employ a robust one-dimensional root-finding algorithm, such as the Brent-Dekker method (`brentq` in SciPy), to find the value of $T_s$ that satisfies $F(T_s) = 0$. The search for the root should be conducted within a physically meaningful range, such as $[T_0, T_\\infty]$. As the surface temperature must lie between the bulk liquid temperature and the ambient temperature, this is a suitable bracket.\n4.  Once the unique surface temperature $T_s^*$ is determined, calculate the corresponding steady mass flux, $j = j_m(T_s^*)$.\n5.  Finally, substitute this mass flux $j$ into the definition of the evaporation constant to obtain the final result:\n    $$\n    K = \\frac{8 R_0}{\\rho_\\ell} j\n    $$\nThis procedure is systematically applied to the three provided test cases (A, B, and C) to determine their respective evaporation constants.",
