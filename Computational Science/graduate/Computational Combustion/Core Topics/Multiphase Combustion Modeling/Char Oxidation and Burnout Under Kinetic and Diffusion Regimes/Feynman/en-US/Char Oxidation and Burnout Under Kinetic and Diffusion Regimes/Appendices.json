            "problem": "A spherical porous char particle of initial radius $R_0$ is oxidized isothermally in a well-mixed flow reactor at temperature $T$ and oxygen mass fraction $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$. Two mechanistic limits are often invoked in computational combustion for char oxidation: a shrinking-core behavior dominated by external diffusion of oxidizer to the particle surface, and a uniform-reaction behavior dominated by intrinsic kinetics within the porous network. Assume the gas-phase is not depleted globally, but near-particle transport can be rate-limiting.\n\nFrom first principles, consider the following bases:\n- Mass conservation for the solid phase, with $m(t) = \\rho_p \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R(t)^3$, where $m(t)$ is the particle mass, $\\rho_p$ is the char density, and $R(t)$ is the instantaneous particle radius.\n- External diffusion-controlled flux scaling from Fick's law, $J_{\\mathrm{O_2}} \\sim k_g\\left(Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},\\infty} - Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},s}\\right)$, where $k_g$ is a gas-side mass transfer coefficient, $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},\\infty}$ is the bulk oxygen mass fraction, and $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},s}$ is the near-surface oxygen mass fraction.\n- Intrinsic kinetic control described by Arrhenius temperature dependence, $k(T) = A\\exp\\left(-E_a/(R_u T)\\right)$, where $A$ is a pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, and $R_u$ is the universal gas constant.\n- Competing heterogeneous pathways, $\\mathrm{C} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{O_2} \\to \\mathrm{CO}$ and $\\mathrm{C} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\to \\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with possible subsequent homogeneous oxidation $\\mathrm{CO} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{O_2} \\to \\mathrm{CO_2}$ in the surrounding gas.\n\nYou measure three experimental observables under otherwise identical conditions across particle sizes: the thermogravimetric mass change curve $m(t)$, the temperature dependence of the overall mass-loss rate (characterized by an apparent activation energy $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ extracted from Arrhenius-type analysis of the rate), and the outlet ratio of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$.\n\nWhich option correctly states the experimental signatures that discriminate shrinking-core diffusion control from uniform-reaction kinetic control?\n\nA. Shrinking-core diffusion control yields $m(t)^{1/3}$ decreasing linearly with $t$; the apparent activation energy $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is weak because external diffusion dominates; and the outlet $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ ratio is comparatively large and increases with particle size. Uniform-reaction kinetic control yields a straight line in $\\ln m(t)$ versus $t$; $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is strong due to intrinsic kinetics; and $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is lower and weakly dependent on particle size.\n\nB. Shrinking-core diffusion control yields $m(t)$ decreasing linearly with $t$; $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is strong; and $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is lower. Uniform-reaction kinetic control yields $\\ln m(t)$ versus $t$ as a downward-curving function; $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is weak; and $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is higher.\n\nC. Shrinking-core diffusion control yields $m(t)^{1/3}$ decreasing linearly with $t$ but with strong $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ due to surface reaction; and $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is lower and insensitive to particle size. Uniform-reaction kinetic control yields $m(t)$ decreasing linearly with $t$; $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is weak; and $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is higher.\n\nD. Both shrinking-core diffusion control and uniform-reaction kinetic control yield exponential $m(t)$ decay; both regimes show strong $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$; and $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is independent of particle size and mechanism.",
            "solution": "The task is to determine the experimental signatures for three observables—mass change $m(t)$, apparent activation energy $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$, and outlet $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ ratio—that distinguish between two limiting cases of char oxidation: shrinking-core diffusion control and uniform-reaction kinetic control.\n\n### Analysis of Shrinking-Core Diffusion Control\n\nThis regime, also known as Regime III, occurs when the intrinsic chemical reaction is very fast compared to the rate of oxidant diffusion from the bulk gas to the particle's external surface. This is typically observed at high temperatures or for large particles.\n\n1.  **Mass Change Curve $m(t)$**:\n    The reaction is confined to the external surface of the particle. The rate of mass loss of the carbon particle, $\\frac{dm}{dt}$, is determined by the rate at which oxygen reaches the surface. The total mass consumption rate is the product of the oxygen mass flux, $J_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$, the particle surface area, $A_p(t) = 4\\pi R(t)^2$, and a stoichiometric factor, $\\phi_C$, which relates the mass of carbon consumed to the mass of oxygen supplied.\n    $$ \\frac{dm}{dt} = - \\phi_C J_{\\mathrm{O_2}} A_p(t) $$\n    In the diffusion-controlled limit, the oxygen concentration at the surface is nearly zero, $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},s} \\approx 0$. The flux is then given by $J_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = \\rho_g k_g Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},\\infty}$, where $\\rho_g$ is the gas density and $k_g$ is the mass transfer coefficient. For a particle in a convective flow (as in a \"well-mixed flow reactor\"), a common simplification is to assume the boundary layer thickness is determined by the flow, not the particle size, rendering $k_g$ approximately constant.\n    The rate expression becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{dm}{dt} = - C_1 A_p(t) = -C_1 (4\\pi R(t)^2) $$\n    where $C_1 = \\phi_C \\rho_g k_g Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},\\infty}$ is a constant under isothermal conditions with constant bulk oxygen fraction.\n    The mass of the spherical particle is $m(t) = \\rho_p \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R(t)^3$, where the particle density $\\rho_p$ is constant. Differentiating with respect to time gives:\n    $$ \\frac{dm}{dt} = \\rho_p \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(3 R(t)^2 \\frac{dR}{dt}\\right) = \\rho_p 4\\pi R(t)^2 \\frac{dR}{dt} $$\n    Equating the two expressions for $\\frac{dm}{dt}$:\n    $$ \\rho_p 4\\pi R(t)^2 \\frac{dR}{dt} = -C_1 4\\pi R(t)^2 $$\n    $$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = -\\frac{C_1}{\\rho_p} = -\\text{constant} $$\n    Integrating this equation yields $R(t) = R_0 - C_2 t$, where $C_2$ is a constant. The radius decreases linearly with time. Since $m(t) \\propto R(t)^3$, the cube root of the mass, $m(t)^{1/3} \\propto R(t)$, will also decrease linearly with time.\n\n2.  **Apparent Activation Energy $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$**:\n    The rate-limiting step is external mass transfer. The mass transfer coefficient $k_g$ depends on gas properties, primarily the mass diffusivity $\\mathcal{D}$. The temperature dependence of diffusivity in gases is weak, typically following a power law like $\\mathcal{D} \\propto T^{n}$ with $n \\approx 1.5 - 1.75$. When the overall rate, which is proportional to $k_g$, is fitted to an Arrhenius form, Rate $\\propto \\exp(-E_{\\mathrm{app}}/(R_u T))$, the resulting apparent activation energy $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is very small compared to typical chemical activation energies. For example, if Rate $\\propto T^{1.75}$, then $E_{\\mathrm{app}} = 1.75 R_u T$, which is only a few kJ/mol. Thus, a signature of diffusion control is a weak apparent activation energy.\n\n3.  **Outlet $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ Ratio**:\n    At the high temperatures characteristic of diffusion control, the primary product of the heterogeneous reaction is carbon monoxide ($\\mathrm{CO}$). This $\\mathrm{CO}$ desorbs from the surface and diffuses outwards, while $\\mathrm{O_2}$ diffuses inwards. In the boundary layer surrounding the particle, the homogeneous reaction $\\mathrm{CO} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{O_2} \\to \\mathrm{CO_2}$ can occur. For larger particles, the overall carbon consumption rate is higher, leading to a more severe depletion of $\\mathrm{O_2}$ in the boundary layer. This oxygen-starved environment inhibits the homogeneous oxidation of $\\mathrm{CO}$, allowing more $\\mathrm{CO}$ to escape to the bulk gas. Therefore, the outlet $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ ratio is expected to be relatively large and to increase with increasing particle size.\n\n### Analysis of Uniform-Reaction Kinetic Control\n\nThis regime, also known as Regime I, occurs when diffusion is very fast compared to the intrinsic chemical reaction rate. This is typical for low temperatures or very small, highly porous particles. The oxidant has access to the entire internal pore network.\n\n1.  **Mass Change Curve $m(t)$**:\n    The reaction occurs uniformly throughout the particle's volume on the vast internal surface area. A common and effective model for this regime assumes that the overall reaction rate is proportional to the total mass of the reactant (char) available.\n    $$ \\frac{dm}{dt} = -k_{eff} \\cdot m(t) $$\n    where $k_{eff}$ is an effective first-order rate constant that depends on the intrinsic kinetics, temperature, and oxygen concentration. Since the problem specifies isothermal conditions and constant bulk $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$, $k_{eff}$ is constant. This is a first-order ordinary differential equation, and its solution is an exponential decay:\n    $$ m(t) = m_0 \\exp(-k_{eff} t) $$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n    $$ \\ln(m(t)) = \\ln(m_0) - k_{eff} t $$\n    This implies that a plot of $\\ln(m(t))$ versus time $t$ will be a straight line with a negative slope.\n\n2.  **Apparent Activation Energy $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$**:\n    The rate is governed by the intrinsic chemical kinetics. The rate constant follows the Arrhenius law, $k(T) = A\\exp(-E_a/(R_u T))$. The overall rate is directly proportional to this intrinsic rate constant. Therefore, the measured apparent activation energy $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ will be equal to the true chemical activation energy $E_a$ of the char oxidation reaction.\n    $$ E_{\\mathrm{app}} = -R_u \\frac{d(\\ln(\\text{Rate}))}{d(1/T)} = E_a $$\n    Chemical activation energies for char-oxygen reactions are significant, typically in the range of $80-200$ kJ/mol. Thus, a signature of kinetic control is a strong apparent activation energy.\n\n3.  **Outlet $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ Ratio**:\n    This regime occurs at lower temperatures. At these temperatures, the surface chemistry often favors the formation of a more stable complex that desorbs as $\\mathrm{CO_2}$, or the primary $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ production ratio is lower than at high temperatures. Furthermore, because the reaction is slow, the particle exists in an oxygen-rich environment ($Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},s} \\approx Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},\\infty}$). Any $\\mathrm{CO}$ that might be formed has a high probability of being oxidized to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ either within the pores or near the particle surface where oxygen is abundant. Transport limitations are, by definition, negligible, so particle size has little effect on the product gas composition. Consequently, the outlet $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ ratio is expected to be lower than in the diffusion-controlled case and to be weakly dependent on particle size.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **Option A**:\n    -   Shrinking-core: Predicts $m(t)^{1/3}$ linear with $t$, weak $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$, and a large $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ ratio that increases with particle size. This is **Correct**.\n    -   Uniform-reaction: Predicts linear $\\ln m(t)$ with $t$, strong $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$, and a lower, size-independent $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ ratio. This is **Correct**.\n    The statements for both regimes align perfectly with the analysis.\n\n*   **Option B**:\n    -   Shrinking-core: Claims $m(t)$ is linear with $t$ (incorrect), $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is strong (incorrect), and $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is lower (incorrect). This is **Incorrect**.\n    -   Uniform-reaction: Claims $\\ln m(t)$ is a downward-curving function (incorrect, it's linear in the standard model), $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is weak (incorrect), and $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is higher (incorrect). This is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**:\n    -   Shrinking-core: Claims strong $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ (incorrect) and a lower, insensitive $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ ratio (incorrect). This is **Incorrect**.\n    -   Uniform-reaction: Claims $m(t)$ is linear with $t$ (incorrect), $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is weak (incorrect), and $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is higher (incorrect). This is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D**:\n    -   Claims both have exponential $m(t)$ decay (incorrect) and strong $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ (incorrect). It also claims the $\\mathrm{CO}/\\mathrm{CO_2}$ ratio is independent of mechanism and particle size (incorrect). This is **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed derivation from first principles, Option A provides a completely accurate description of the contrasting experimental signatures for the two limiting regimes of char oxidation.",

            "problem": "A single spherical char particle is oxidizing in an oxygen-rich environment. In the kinetic-controlled limit, the intrinsic surface reaction rate constant for char oxidation is modeled by the Arrhenius relation $k_{s}(T)=A\\exp\\!\\left(-E_{a}/(R\\,T)\\right)$, where $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_{a}$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

As the activation energy $E_{a}$ increases, this term decreases. Consequently, the denominator $\\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{R \\ln(2)}{E_{a}}\\right)$ increases, approaching $\\frac{1}{T_{1}}$. This means that $T_{2}$ decreases, approaching $T_{1}$. Therefore, the temperature increment $\\Delta T = T_{2} - T_{1}$ decreases as $E_{a}$ increases.\nThis signifies that for a reaction with a higher activation energy, a smaller increase in temperature is required to achieve the same relative increase (doubling) in the reaction rate constant. In other words, the intrinsic reaction rate is more sensitive to temperature when the activation energy is large.\n\nThis finding directly relates to the different regimes of char oxidation:\n1.  **Kinetic-Controlled Regime:** This regime dominates at lower temperatures, where the overall rate of oxidation is limited by the intrinsic speed of the chemical reaction on the char surface. Surface chemical reactions, involving the breaking and forming of chemical bonds, are characterized by a high activation energy, $E_{a}$. Based on our analysis, a high $E_{a}$ implies a strong dependence of the reaction rate on temperature. This is a defining characteristic of the kinetic-controlled regime.\n2.  **Diffusion-Controlled Regime:** This regime occurs at very high temperatures. The intrinsic chemical reaction is so fast that the overall process is limited by the rate at which the gaseous oxidant (e.g., oxygen) can be transported from the bulk fluid to the particle surface. Mass diffusion is a physical transport process, not a chemical reaction, and its temperature dependence is much weaker than that of a chemical reaction. The effective activation energy for diffusion is very low. According to our analysis, a low $E_{a}$ implies a weak dependence of the rate on temperature (a larger $\\Delta T$ is needed to double the rate). This low sensitivity to temperature is a hallmark of the diffusion-controlled regime.\n\nIn summary, the derived mathematical relationship confirms the fundamental principle that the strong temperature sensitivity of char oxidation in the kinetic-controlled regime is due to its high activation energy, whereas the weak temperature sensitivity in the diffusion-controlled regime is due to the low effective activation energy of the rate-limiting mass transfer process.",

Within each pore, both molecular diffusion and Knudsen diffusion act as resistances to mass transfer in series. Across the cross-section of the porous medium, pores act in parallel to carry oxygen flux.

We calculate it for each of the two pore sizes at $T=1200\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$$\nD_{K}(r, T) = \\frac{2}{3}\\,r\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{8\\,R\\,T}{\\pi\\,M}}\n$$\nLet's first compute the radical term, which represents the mean molecular speed of oxygen scaled by a constant:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{8\\,R\\,T}{\\pi\\,M}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 (8.314) (1200)}{\\pi (0.032)}} \\approx 891.019\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\nFor the small pores ($r_{1}=5.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$):\n$$\nD_{K1} = \\frac{2}{3} (5.0 \\times 10^{-8}) (891.019) \\approx 2.97006 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$\nFor the large pores ($r_{2}=2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$):\n$$\nD_{K2} = \\frac{2}{3} (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}) (891.019) \\approx 1.18803 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$\nNow, we can find the composite diffusivity for each pore type using the Bosanquet formula.\nFor the small pores:\n$$\nD_{\\text{pore},1} = \\left( \\frac{1}{1.60 \\times 10^{-4}} + \\frac{1}{2.97006 \\times 10^{-5}} \\right)^{-1} = (6250 + 33669.4)^{-1} = (39919.4)^{-1} \\approx 2.5050 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$\nNotice that for these small pores, $D_{K1} \\ll D_{m}$, so the diffusion is Knudsen-dominated, and $D_{\\text{pore},1}$ is close to $D_{K1}$.\n\nFor the large pores:\n$$\nD_{\\text{pore},2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{1.60 \\times 10^{-4}} + \\frac{1}{1.18803 \\times 10^{-3}} \\right)^{-1} = (6250 + 841.7)^{-1} = (7091.7)^{-1} \\approx 1.4100 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$\nFor these large pores, $D_{K2} \\gg D_{m}$, so the diffusion is molecule-molecule collision dominated, and $D_{\\text{pore},2}$ is close to $D_{m}$.\n\nThe problem states that the pores act in parallel. Therefore, the total flux is the sum of fluxes through each pore type, weighted by their respective area fractions. This leads to an area-weighted average diffusivity, $D_{\\text{avg}}$, for the straight-pore network:\n$$\nD_{\\text{avg}} = f_{1}D_{\\text{pore},1} + f_{2}D_{\\text{pore},2}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{avg}} = (0.40)(2.5050 \\times 10^{-5}) + (0.60)(1.4100 \\times 10^{-4}) = (1.0020 \\times 10^{-5}) + (8.4600 \\times 10^{-5}) = 9.4620 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$\nFinally, to obtain the macroscale effective diffusivity, $D_{\\text{eff}}$, we must account for the geometry of the porous medium. The porosity, $\\epsilon$, reduces the cross-sectional area available for transport, and the tortuosity, $\\tau$, increases the actual path length for diffusion. The standard correction is:\n$$\nD_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\tau} D_{\\text{avg}}\n$$\nUsing the given values $\\epsilon=0.40$ and $\\tau=2.5$:\n$$\nD_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{0.40}{2.5} (9.4620 \\times 10^{-5}) = 0.16 \\times (9.4620 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 1.5139 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nD_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 1.514 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$\nThe value of $D_{\\text{eff}}$ depends on the pore size distribution because diffusion in small pores is limited by wall collisions (Knudsen diffusion), while in large pores it is limited by molecule-molecule collisions (molecular diffusion). The overall diffusivity is an average over these different transport regimes. It depends on temperature because both $D_m \\propto T^{3/2}$ and $D_K \\propto T^{1/2}$ increase with temperature, leading to a higher overall effective diffusivity at elevated temperatures.",
