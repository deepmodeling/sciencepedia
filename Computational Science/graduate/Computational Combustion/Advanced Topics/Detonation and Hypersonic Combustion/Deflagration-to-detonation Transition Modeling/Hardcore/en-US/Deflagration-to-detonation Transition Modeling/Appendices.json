We define the dimensionless temperature ratio $\\theta = T_2/T_1$, the density ratio $\\eta = \\rho_2/\\rho_1$, and the velocity ratio $\\Gamma = u_2/u_1$. From mass conservation, we have $\\Gamma = 1/\\eta$.\n\n**2. Derivation of an Equation for the Velocity Ratio $\\Gamma$**\nWe will derive two expressions for the temperature ratio $\\theta$ and equate them to find an equation for $\\Gamma$.\n\nFirst, from the momentum equation:\n$p_2 - p_1 = \\rho_1 u_1^2 - \\rho_2 u_2^2 = \\rho_1 u_1^2 - (\\eta \\rho_1) (\\Gamma^2 u_1^2) = \\rho_1 u_1^2 (1 - \\eta \\Gamma^2)$.\nUsing $\\eta \\Gamma = 1$, we get $p_2 - p_1 = \\rho_1 u_1^2(1-\\Gamma)$.\nThe pressure ratio $p_2/p_1$ can be expressed as:\n$\\frac{p_2}{p_1} = 1 + \\frac{\\rho_1 u_1^2}{p_1}(1-\\Gamma)$.\nUsing the Ideal Gas Law $p_1 = \\rho_1 R T_1$ and the definitions $a_1^2 = \\gamma R T_1$ and $M_1 = u_1/a_1$, we find $\\frac{\\rho_1 u_1^2}{p_1} = \\gamma M_1^2$.\nSo, the pressure ratio is $\\frac{p_2}{p_1} = 1 + \\gamma M_1^2(1-\\Gamma)$.\n\nFrom the Ideal Gas Law, the temperature ratio is $\\theta = \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{p_2/p_1}{\\rho_2/\\rho_1} = \\frac{p_2/p_1}{\\eta} = \\Gamma \\frac{p_2}{p_1}$.\nSubstituting the expression for the pressure ratio, we obtain our first relation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\Gamma[1 + \\gamma M_1^2(1-\\Gamma)] \\quad (*)$$\n\nSecond, from the energy equation:\n$c_p T_2 - c_p T_1 - q = \\frac{1}{2}(u_1^2 - u_2^2)$.\nDividing by $c_p T_1$:\n$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} - 1 - \\frac{q}{c_p T_1} = \\frac{u_1^2}{2 c_p T_1} (1 - (\\frac{u_2}{u_1})^2)$.\nUsing the definitions $\\theta = T_2/T_1$, $\\epsilon = q/(c_p T_1)$, and $\\Gamma=u_2/u_1$, and the relation $c_p = \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma-1}$, we can write:\n$\\frac{u_1^2}{2 c_p T_1} = \\frac{M_1^2 a_1^2}{2 c_p T_1} = \\frac{M_1^2 \\gamma R T_1}{2 (\\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma-1}) T_1} = \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2$.\nThe energy equation becomes our second relation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = 1 + \\epsilon + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2 (1 - \\Gamma^2) \\quad (**) $$\n\nNow, we equate the two expressions for $\\theta$ from $(*)$ and $(**)$:\n$\\Gamma[1 + \\gamma M_1^2(1-\\Gamma)] = 1 + \\epsilon + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2 (1 - \\Gamma^2)$.\n$\\Gamma + \\gamma M_1^2 \\Gamma - \\gamma M_1^2 \\Gamma^2 = 1 + \\epsilon + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2 - \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2 \\Gamma^2$.\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form $A\\Gamma^2 + B\\Gamma + C = 0$:\n$\\left(\\gamma M_1^2 - \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2\\right)\\Gamma^2 - (1 + \\gamma M_1^2)\\Gamma + \\left(1 + \\epsilon + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2\\right) = 0$.\nThe coefficient of $\\Gamma^2$ is $M_1^2(\\gamma - \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}) = M_1^2\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2}$.\nThe quadratic equation for $\\Gamma$ is:\n$$ \\frac{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2}{2} \\Gamma^2 - (1 + \\gamma M_1^2)\\Gamma + \\left(1 + \\epsilon + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2\\right) = 0 $$\n\nSolving for $\\Gamma$ using the quadratic formula $\\Gamma = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{(1 + \\gamma M_1^2) \\pm \\sqrt{(1+\\gamma M_1^2)^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2}{2}\\right)\\left(1+\\epsilon+\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2\\right)}}{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2} $$\nLet's simplify the term under the square root:\n$(1+2\\gamma M_1^2 + \\gamma^2 M_1^4) - 2(\\gamma+1)M_1^2(1+\\epsilon) - (\\gamma+1)(\\gamma-1)M_1^4$\n$= 1 + M_1^2(2\\gamma - 2\\gamma - 2) + M_1^4(\\gamma^2 - (\\gamma^2-1)) - 2\\epsilon(\\gamma+1)M_1^2$\n$= 1 - 2M_1^2 + M_1^4 - 2\\epsilon(\\gamma+1)M_1^2 = (M_1^2-1)^2 - 2\\epsilon(\\gamma+1)M_1^2$.\n\nSo the solution for $\\Gamma$ is:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{1 + \\gamma M_1^2 \\pm \\sqrt{(M_1^2-1)^2 - 2\\epsilon(\\gamma+1)M_1^2}}{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2} $$\nFor a compressive wave ($M_1 > 1$), the downstream velocity is lower, so $\\Gamma  1$. The inert case ($\\epsilon=0$) gives $\\Gamma = \\frac{1+\\gamma M_1^2 \\pm (M_1^2-1)}{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2}$. The plus sign gives $\\Gamma=1$ (trivial solution), while the minus sign gives the shock solution. Thus, we must choose the minus sign.\nLet $\\Gamma_{reac}$ be the velocity ratio for the reactive case:\n$$ \\Gamma_{reac} = \\frac{1 + \\gamma M_1^2 - \\sqrt{(M_1^2-1)^2 - 2\\epsilon(\\gamma+1)M_1^2}}{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2} $$\n\n**3. Temperature Ratio Expressions**\nWe use the energy-based expression for $\\theta$, equation $(**)$, to find the temperature ratios.\nFor the reactive case:\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \\epsilon + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2 (1 - \\Gamma_{reac}^2) $$\nFor the inert case, we set $\\epsilon=0$ in the expression for $\\Gamma$ to get $\\Gamma_{inert}$:\n$$ \\Gamma_{inert} = \\frac{1 + \\gamma M_1^2 - \\sqrt{(M_1^2-1)^2}}{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2} = \\frac{1 + \\gamma M_1^2 - (M_1^2-1)}{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2} = \\frac{2 + (\\gamma-1)M_1^2}{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2} $$\nThe inert temperature ratio is then:\n$$ \\frac{T_2^{\\mathrm{inert}}}{T_1} = 1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2 (1 - \\Gamma_{inert}^2) $$\n\n**4. Final Ratio**\nThe required final result is the ratio $\\frac{T_2/T_1}{(T_2^{\\mathrm{inert}}/T_1)}$.\n$$ \\frac{T_2/T_1}{(T_2^{\\mathrm{inert}}/T_1)} = \\frac{1 + \\epsilon + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2 (1 - \\Gamma_{reac}^2)}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2 (1 - \\Gamma_{inert}^2)} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Gamma_{reac}$ and $\\Gamma_{inert}$:\n$$ \\frac{T_2/T_1}{(T_2^{\\mathrm{inert}}/T_1)} = \\frac{1 + \\epsilon + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{1 + \\gamma M_1^2 - \\sqrt{(M_1^2-1)^2 - 2\\epsilon(\\gamma+1)M_1^2}}{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2}\\right)^2\\right)}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_1^2 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{2 + (\\gamma-1)M_1^2}{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2}\\right)^2\\right)} $$\nThis is the complete, closed-form analytic expression for the required ratio in terms of only $M_1$, $\\gamma$, and $\\epsilon$. No further simplification is readily available without making the expression significantly more complex visually.",
