            "problem": "Consider a thin azimuthal wave in a Rotating Detonation Engine (RDE) propagating through a premixed, calorically perfect gas. The premix initially consists of stoichiometric reactants at rest with pressure $p_{0}$, temperature $T_{0}$, specific volume $v_{0}$, density $\\rho_{0} = 1/v_{0}$, and ratio of specific heats $\\gamma_{0}$. The detonation is modeled as a zero-thickness discontinuity obeying the one-dimensional conservation of mass, momentum, and energy with a net specific heat release $q0$. The wave speed is the Chapman–Jouguet (CJ) speed $D_{CJ}$, and the CJ condition imposes that the flow immediately behind the wave is sonic relative to the wave. Two thermodynamic closures are considered for the state immediately behind the leading shock:\n\n- Frozen composition behind the shock: the post-shock state obeys the reactant equation of state with ratio of specific heats $\\gamma_{\\text{f}}$ (composition frozen during the shock).\n- Equilibrium composition behind the shock: the post-shock state obeys the equilibrium product equation of state with ratio of specific heats $\\gamma_{\\text{e}}$ (composition instantly equilibrated by the shock).\n\nBoth closures use the ideal-gas, calorically perfect relation $e = p v /(\\gamma-1)$ and $h = \\gamma p v /(\\gamma-1)$. Starting from the conservation laws for a steady one-dimensional discontinuity, and the CJ sonic condition, do the following:\n\n1. Carefully explain, in physical and thermodynamic terms, the distinction between frozen and equilibrium compositions behind the shock in the detonation structure of an RDE, and how this distinction alters the equation of state that closes the jump conditions.\n\n2. Using only the fundamental jump relations and the ideal-gas closure, derive the reactive Hugoniot relation for each assumption, expressing the downstream energy in terms of upstream quantities, the downstream pressure $p_{2}$, and specific volume $v_{2}$:\n   - The frozen-composition Hugoniot, in which the downstream internal energy uses $\\gamma_{\\text{f}}$.\n   - The equilibrium-composition Hugoniot, in which the downstream internal energy uses $\\gamma_{\\text{e}}$.\n   Do not introduce any empirical detonation formulas; proceed from the definitions and laws stated above.\n\n3. Impose the CJ sonic condition to eliminate the downstream velocity, and reduce the jump relations to a closed equation for $D_{CJ}$. In the asymptotic regime relevant to strongly exothermic RDE operation, assume $q \\gg p_{0} v_{0}$ so that upstream sensible enthalpy is negligible compared to $q$. Under this assumption, show analytically how the different post-shock $\\gamma$ values lead to different asymptotic CJ speeds $D_{CJ,\\text{f}}$ and $D_{CJ,\\text{e}}$, and obtain a closed-form expression for the ratio $D_{CJ,\\text{f}}/D_{CJ,\\text{e}}$ purely in terms of $\\gamma_{\\text{f}}$ and $\\gamma_{\\text{e}}$.\n\nFinally, evaluate this ratio for a stoichiometric hydrogen–air mixture representative of RDE operation with the following values: $\\gamma_{\\text{f}} = 1.35$ and $\\gamma_{\\text{e}} = 1.25$. Express your final result as a dimensionless number and round your answer to four significant figures. No units should be reported for the ratio.",
            "solution": "The physical distinction is as follows. In a detonation, the leading shock compresses and heats the mixture, and chemical reactions follow in a finite zone behind the shock. Under the frozen-composition assumption behind the shock, the composition is constrained to remain the same as the far-upstream reactants during the shock jump, so the thermodynamic properties (including the ratio of specific heats) of the immediately post-shock state are those of the reactants. Under the equilibrium-composition assumption behind the shock, the shock is considered sufficiently strong that the state immediately behind it has already relaxed to chemical equilibrium, so the thermodynamic properties (including the ratio of specific heats) of that post-shock state are those of the equilibrium products. In both cases, the jump conditions across the thin detonation discontinuity must be closed by an equation of state, and the choice of composition (frozen versus equilibrium) alters the value of $\\gamma$ that enters the thermodynamic relations for internal energy and enthalpy. Because the ratio of specific heats affects the speed of sound, enthalpy, and the shape of the Hugoniot curve in the pressure–specific-volume ($p$–$v$) plane, the CJ point selected by tangency with the Rayleigh line, and hence the CJ speed $D_{CJ}$, will depend on whether the post-shock state is treated as frozen or equilibrium.\n\nWe begin from the one-dimensional, steady conservation laws across a thin reactive discontinuity (shock plus reaction zone collapsed to a surface) in the wave-fixed frame. Let subscripts $0$ denote upstream (unburned, at rest in the lab), and $2$ denote the state immediately behind the detonation discontinuity. The mass, momentum, and energy jump relations are:\n- Mass: $m = \\rho_{0} u_{0} = \\rho_{2} u_{2}$, where $u$ is the velocity in the wave-fixed frame and $m$ is the mass flux. For a wave moving at speed $D$ into quiescent gas, $u_{0} = D$ and $m = \\rho_{0} D$.\n- Momentum: $p_{2} - p_{0} = m^{2} (v_{0} - v_{2})$, with $v = 1/\\rho$ the specific volume.\n- Energy with net heat release $q$ per unit mass: $h_{2} + \\frac{1}{2} u_{2}^{2} = h_{0} + \\frac{1}{2} u_{0}^{2} + q$.\n\nThe reactive Hugoniot is obtained by eliminating velocities in favor of thermodynamic variables using $u_{i} = m v_{i}$ and $h_{i} = e_{i} + p_{i} v_{i}$:\n\n$$\ne_{2} - e_{0} = q + \\frac{1}{2} (p_{2} + p_{0}) (v_{0} - v_{2}).\n$$\n\nThis relation is general; the closure comes from the equation of state for $e$.\n\nFor a calorically perfect ideal gas, $e = p v / (\\gamma - 1)$ and $h = \\gamma p v / (\\gamma - 1)$. The distinction between frozen and equilibrium compositions enters through the value of $\\gamma$ used for the downstream state:\n- Frozen-composition Hugoniot: the downstream internal energy is $e_{2} = p_{2} v_{2} / (\\gamma_{\\text{f}} - 1)$, while the upstream is $e_{0} = p_{0} v_{0} / (\\gamma_{0} - 1)$. The reactive Hugoniot becomes\n\n$$\n\\frac{p_{2} v_{2}}{\\gamma_{\\text{f}} - 1} - \\frac{p_{0} v_{0}}{\\gamma_{0} - 1} = q + \\frac{1}{2} (p_{2} + p_{0}) (v_{0} - v_{2}).\n$$\n\n- Equilibrium-composition Hugoniot: the downstream internal energy is $e_{2} = p_{2} v_{2} / (\\gamma_{\\text{e}} - 1)$, giving\n\n$$\n\\frac{p_{2} v_{2}}{\\gamma_{\\text{e}} - 1} - \\frac{p_{0} v_{0}}{\\gamma_{0} - 1} = q + \\frac{1}{2} (p_{2} + p_{0}) (v_{0} - v_{2}).\n$$\n\n\nTo connect to $D_{CJ}$, impose the CJ sonic condition.

The time integration for the hyperbolic transport uses an explicit scheme with a prescribed Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) number $\\mathrm{CFL} = 0.5$. The reactive source term for $Y_{F}$ is\n$$\n\\omega_{F} = - \\rho\\, K(T)\\, Y_{F}, \\quad K(T) = A \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E}{R\\,T}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $A = 2.0 \\times 10^{13}$ s$^{-1}$, $E/R = 1.8 \\times 10^{4}$ K, and the post-detonation temperature is approximately $T = 2800$ K. Assume operator splitting in which the transport and reaction are advanced separately, and that the reaction update for $Y_{F}$ uses explicit forward Euler.\n\nStarting from first principles of hyperbolic wave propagation and linear stability of explicit time integration of stiff ordinary differential equations, compute the maximum stable explicit time step $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ that simultaneously satisfies the transport CFL constraint in the azimuthal direction and the explicit-chemistry stability constraint implied by the linearized source term. Express your final answer in seconds and round it to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe central task is to determine the maximum stable explicit time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, for a numerical simulation employing operator splitting to solve the reactive Euler equations. This requires satisfying two independent stability constraints: one arising from the hyperbolic transport of mass, momentum, and energy, and the other from the explicit integration of the stiff chemical source term. The overall maximum stable time step is the minimum of the time steps allowed by each constraint.\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\min(\\Delta t_{\\text{transport}}, \\Delta t_{\\text{reaction}})\n$$\n\nFirst, we analyze the constraint imposed by the hyperbolic transport term, which is governed by the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition. For a one-dimensional hyperbolic system, the CFL condition for an explicit finite-volume scheme is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{transport}} \\le \\mathrm{CFL} \\frac{\\Delta x}{|\\lambda|_{\\max}}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{CFL}$ is the prescribed CFL number, $\\Delta x$ is the spatial grid size, and $|\\lambda|_{\\max}$ is the magnitude of the fastest-propagating characteristic wave in the system.\n\nThe computational domain is a one-dimensional annulus of circumference $L = 1.0$ m, discretized into $N = 10000$ uniform cells. The cell size $\\Delta x$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta x = \\frac{L}{N} = \\frac{1.0}{10000} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}\n$$\nThe characteristic speeds (eigenvalues) of the 1D Euler equations are $u$, $u+a$, and $u-a$, where $u$ is the local flow velocity and $a$ is the local sound speed. The maximum characteristic speed at any point in the domain and time is given by $|\\lambda|_{\\max} = |u| + a$. The problem provides the global maximum bounds for these quantities: $|u|_{\\max} = 1100$ m/s and $a_{\\max} = 1400$ m/s. The most restrictive condition for transport arises where this speed is greatest.\n$$\n|\\lambda|_{\\text{global max}} = |u|_{\\max} + a_{\\max} = 1100 \\, \\text{m/s} + 1400 \\, \\text{m/s} = 2500 \\, \\text{m/s}\n$$\nUsing the prescribed CFL number, $\\mathrm{CFL} = 0.5$, we can calculate the maximum time step allowed by the transport constraint:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{transport}} = \\mathrm{CFL} \\frac{\\Delta x}{|u|_{\\max} + a_{\\max}} = 0.5 \\times \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}}{2500 \\, \\text{m/s}} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 10^{-4}}{2.5 \\times 10^3} \\, \\text{s} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{s} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the stability constraint imposed by the explicit integration of the chemical reaction source term. The problem specifies that the reaction part of the operator splitting is handled with an explicit forward Euler scheme. The governing equation for the fuel mass fraction $Y_F$ during the reaction substep is:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\rho Y_F)}{dt} = \\omega_F\n$$\nAssuming the density $\\rho$ is frozen during this substep (a standard practice in operator splitting), we can write the ODE for $Y_F$ as:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{dY_F}{dt} = \\omega_F = -\\rho K(T) Y_F\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dY_F}{dt} = -K(T) Y_F\n$$\nThis is a linear ordinary differential equation of the form $\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\lambda y$, with the eigenvalue $\\lambda = -K(T)$. For the explicit forward Euler method, $y_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t (\\lambda y_n) = (1 + \\lambda \\Delta t) y_n$, the stability condition requires the magnitude of the amplification factor to be less than or equal to one: $|1 + \\lambda \\Delta t| \\le 1$. Since $\\lambda = -K(T)$ is a real and negative value (as $K(T)0$), this inequality becomes:\n$$\n-1 \\le 1 - K(T)\\Delta t \\le 1\n$$\nThe right side, $1 - K(T)\\Delta t \\le 1$, implies $-K(T)\\Delta t \\le 0$, which is always satisfied for $\\Delta t  0$. The left side imposes the actual constraint:\n$$\n-1 \\le 1 - K(T)\\Delta t \\implies K(T)\\Delta t \\le 2 \\implies \\Delta t \\le \\frac{2}{K(T)}\n$$\nThis defines the maximum stable time step for the reaction, $\\Delta t_{\\text{reaction}}$. The constraint is most severe where the reaction rate constant $K(T)$ is largest, which occurs at the highest temperature. We use the given post-detonation temperature $T = 2800$ K and the Arrhenius parameters $A = 2.0 \\times 10^{13}$ s$^{-1}$ and $E/R = 1.8 \\times 10^{4}$ K.\n$$\nK(T) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT}\\right) = (2.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1.8 \\times 10^4}{2800}\\right) \\, \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nK(2800) = (2.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{45}{7}\\right) \\, \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe reaction time step limit is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{reaction}} = \\frac{2}{K(2800)} = \\frac{2}{(2.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\exp(-45/7)} \\, \\text{s} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-13} \\exp\\left(\\frac{45}{7}\\right) \\, \\text{s}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\frac{45}{7} \\approx 6.42857$, so $\\exp(\\frac{45}{7}) \\approx 619.162$.\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{reaction}} \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{-13}) \\times 619.162 \\, \\text{s} \\approx 6.19162 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{s}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compare the two time step constraints to find the overall maximum stable time step:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{transport}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{reaction}} \\approx 6.19 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{s}\n$$\nComparing these values, it is evident that $\\Delta t_{\\text{reaction}} \\ll \\Delta t_{\\text{transport}}$. The chemical kinetics are extremely stiff and therefore dictate the stability limit of the entire scheme.\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\min(2.0 \\times 10^{-8}, 6.19162 \\times 10^{-11}) = 6.19162 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{s}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested, we obtain the final answer.\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} \\approx 6.19 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{s}\n$$",
