            "problem": "In computational acoustics of poroelastic media, Biot’s theory models the low-frequency dynamic response of a fluid-saturated porous solid by coupling the solid skeleton deformation with pore fluid pressure. Consider an isotropic sandstone whose drained bulk modulus is $K_{b}$ and whose mineral grain (solid) bulk modulus is $K_{s}$. The Biot coefficient $\\alpha$ is defined by how pore pressure contributes to the effective stress carried by the solid skeleton and can be inferred by enforcing consistency of volumetric strain under hydrostatic loading.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of bulk modulus and the effective stress concept in poroelasticity, and considering a hydrostatic loading path in which the confining pressure and pore pressure are equal, derive an expression for the Biot coefficient $\\alpha$ in terms of $K_{b}$ and $K_{s}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the Biot coefficient, $\\alpha$, in terms of the drained bulk modulus, $K_b$, and the solid grain bulk modulus, $K_s$, for an isotropic poroelastic material. This derivation is to be based on fundamental principles and a specific hydrostatic loading path. Following the derivation, a numerical value for $\\alpha$ is to be computed for a given sandstone, along with a qualitative physical interpretation.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental constitutive relations for a linear, isotropic poroelastic medium. The volumetric strain of the porous skeleton, $\\varepsilon_v$, is a function of the confining pressure, $P_c$, and the pore fluid pressure, $p$. According to Biot's theory, the skeleton's deformation is driven by an effective stress. Using a sign convention where pressure and compressive strain are positive, the change in bulk volume, which corresponds to $-\\varepsilon_v$, is related to the effective pressure change. The governing equation for the volumetric strain can be written as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_b}(P_c - \\alpha p)\n$$\nThis equation is a statement of the effective stress principle for volumetric deformation. Here, $K_b$ is the drained bulk modulus of the skeleton, defined as the ratio of an increment of confining pressure to the induced volumetric strain under drained conditions ($p = \\text{constant}$). The Biot coefficient $\\alpha$ quantifies the effectiveness of the pore pressure in counteracting the confining pressure.\n\nThe problem guides us to consider a specific loading path where the confining pressure and pore pressure are equal, i.e., $P_c = p$. This scenario is known as an \"unjacketed test\". In this test, the porous medium is completely submerged in a fluid at pressure $p$, which acts both on the external boundaries and within the pore space.\n\nUnder this condition, every point within the solid material of the skeleton (the mineral grains) is subjected to a uniform hydrostatic pressure $p$. The deformation of the solid grains is governed by the solid bulk modulus, $K_s$. The definition of $K_s$ relates the pressure acting on the solid material to its volumetric strain, $\\varepsilon_s$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_s = \\frac{p}{K_s}\n$$\nSince the pressure is uniform throughout the solid and fluid phases, there is no differential pressure to deform the pore structure itself. The entire material, both solid and pores, compresses as if it were a non-porous solid made of the grain material. The change in the total volume of the solid phase, $\\Delta V_s$, and the change in the total volume of the pore phase, $\\Delta V_p$, are:\n$$\n\\Delta V_s = \\varepsilon_s V_s = \\frac{p}{K_s}V_s\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta V_p = \\varepsilon_s V_p = \\frac{p}{K_s}V_p\n$$\nwhere $V_s$ and $V_p$ are the initial solid and pore volumes, respectively. The change in the total bulk volume, $\\Delta V_b$, is the sum of these changes:\n$$\n\\Delta V_b = \\Delta V_s + \\Delta V_p = \\frac{p}{K_s}(V_s + V_p) = \\frac{p}{K_s}V_b\n$$\nwhere $V_b = V_s + V_p$ is the initial bulk volume. The bulk volumetric strain $\\varepsilon_v = \\Delta V_b / V_b$ under this specific loading condition is therefore:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{p}{K_s}\n$$\nWe now have two expressions for the volumetric strain $\\varepsilon_v$. The first is the general constitutive law, and the second is the result for the specific path $P_c = p$. For the theory to be consistent, the general law must yield the specific result when the appropriate conditions are applied. We substitute $P_c = p$ into the general constitutive equation:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_b}(p - \\alpha p) = \\frac{p(1 - \\alpha)}{K_b}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\varepsilon_v$ for the case $P_c = p$:\n$$\n\\frac{p(1 - \\alpha)}{K_b} = \\frac{p}{K_s}\n$$\nAssuming a non-zero pressure change, $p \\neq 0$, we can cancel $p$ from both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{1 - \\alpha}{K_b} = \\frac{1}{K_s}\n$$\nSolving for the Biot coefficient $\\alpha$ yields the desired expression:\n$$\n1 - \\alpha = \\frac{K_b}{K_s}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_b}{K_s}\n$$\nThis expression defines the Biot coefficient in terms of the drained bulk modulus of the skeleton and the bulk modulus of the solid grains.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\alpha$ for the given sandstone properties:\n- Drained bulk modulus: $K_b = 8\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$\n- Solid grain bulk modulus: $K_s = 36\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{8\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{36\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = 1 - \\frac{8}{36}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\n\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{9}{9} - \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{7}{9}\n$$\nThe numerical value of the Biot coefficient is $\\frac{7}{9}$.\n\nFinally, we provide a qualitative comment on this result. The computed value $\\alpha = 7/9 \\approx 0.778$ is a dimensionless quantity that is less than but relatively close to unity. The derived relation $\\alpha = 1 - K_b/K_s$ shows that $\\alpha$ approaches $1$ as the ratio $K_b/K_s$ approaches $0$. This condition, $K_b \\ll K_s$, implies that the porous skeleton is much more compressible (i.e., \"softer\") than the solid mineral grains from which it is formed. For the given sandstone, $K_b = 8\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$ is indeed much smaller than $K_s = 36\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, confirming that the skeleton's compressibility is the dominant deformation mechanism under drained loading.\n\nPhysically, a value of $\\alpha$ close to $1$ signifies that the pore pressure is highly effective at resisting the compression of the bulk material by the external confining pressure. In the effective stress law, $P_c - \\alpha p$, if $\\alpha \\approx 1$, the expression approaches the simple Terzaghi effective stress, $P_c - p$. This means that an increase in pore pressure almost entirely cancels out the volumetric-strain-inducing effect of an equal increase in confining pressure. The deviation of $\\alpha$ from unity, given by the ratio $K_b/K_s$, accounts for the fact that the solid grains are not infinitely rigid; part of the stress is accommodated by the compression of the grains themselves, rather than being borne entirely by the skeleton frame. Thus, the value of $\\alpha$ being close to $1$ for sandstone reflects the physical reality of a compliant porous structure made from strong, stiff mineral grains.",

The system becomes:\n$$ \\lambda \\begin{bmatrix} A & Q \\\\ Q & R \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} U \\\\ W \\end{bmatrix} = \\left( \\omega^2 \\begin{bmatrix} \\rho_{11} & \\rho_{12} \\\\ \\rho_{12} & \\rho_{22} \\end{bmatrix} + i\\omega \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & b \\end{bmatrix} \\right) \\begin{bmatrix} U \\\\ W \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThis is precisely the generalized eigenvalue problem specified in the problem statement, $\\lambda\\,\\mathbf{G}\\,\\mathbf{v} = \\left(\\omega^2\\,\\mathbf{M} + i\\,\\omega\\,\\mathbf{C}\\right)\\,\\mathbf{v}$.\n\n### Computational Procedure\n\nThe solution requires solving this $2 \\times 2$ generalized eigenvalue problem for the eigenvalue $\\lambda = \\kappa^2$.\n\n$1$. **Matrix Assembly**: For each test case, we first calculate the scalar coefficients $A$, $Q$, $R$, $\\rho_{11}$, $\\rho_{22}$, and $b$ from the provided fundamental physical parameters.\n$2$. **System Formulation**: We construct the stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{G}$, mass matrix $\\mathbf{M}$, and damping matrix $\\mathbf{C}$. Then, we form the complex frequency-dependent matrix $\\mathbf{K}(\\omega) = \\omega^2\\mathbf{M} + i\\omega\\mathbf{C}$. The problem becomes $\\mathbf{K}(\\omega)\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathbf{G}\\mathbf{v}$.\n$3$. **Eigenvalue Solution**: This generalized eigenvalue problem is solved computationally. Standard numerical libraries provide robust solvers for this task. For each test case, the solution yields two complex eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$.\n$4$. **Phase Velocity Calculation**: The phase velocity $c$ is related to the wavenumber $\\kappa$ and frequency $\\omega$ by $c = \\omega/\\kappa$. Since $\\lambda = \\kappa^2$, the phase velocities are computed as:\n$$ c_i = \\frac{\\omega}{\\kappa_i} = \\frac{\\omega}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_i}}, \\quad i \\in \\{1, 2\\} $$\nThe complex square root must be taken using the principal branch, which ensures a non-negative real part for the phase velocity, corresponding to a wave propagating in the chosen direction. The solution yields two complex velocities, corresponding to the \"fast\" and \"slow\" compressional waves predicted by Biot's theory.\n$5$. **Final Result**: The problem requires reporting the real part of these complex velocities, which represents the propagation speed. The two real-valued speeds for each test case are sorted in descending order to identify the fast ($c_{\\text{fast}}$) and slow ($c_{\\text{slow}}$) waves and then rounded to six decimal places as specified.",
