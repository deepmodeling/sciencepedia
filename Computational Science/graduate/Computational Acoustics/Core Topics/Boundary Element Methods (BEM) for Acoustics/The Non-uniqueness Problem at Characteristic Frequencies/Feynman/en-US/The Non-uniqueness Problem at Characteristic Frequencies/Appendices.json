            "problem": "Consider the interior acoustic Helmholtz boundary value problem on a disk of radius $a$ in the plane.

No numerical approximation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of characteristic wavenumbers for the interior acoustic Helmholtz problem on a circular disk of radius $a$. The governing partial differential equation (PDE) is the Helmholtz equation, $\\nabla^2 p + k^2 p = 0$.\n\nIn two-dimensional polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ is given by $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2}$. The Helmholtz equation is thus:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial \\theta^2} + k^2 p = 0 $$\nWe seek non-trivial solutions $p(r, \\theta)$ that satisfy this PDE within the disk $0 \\le r < a$ and also satisfy specific boundary conditions at $r=a$. The method of separation of variables is employed. We assume a solution of the form $p(r, \\theta) = R(r)\\Theta(\\theta)$. Substituting this into the PDE yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\Theta(\\theta)}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{dR}{dr}\\right) + \\frac{R(r)}{r^2}\\frac{d^2\\Theta}{d\\theta^2} + k^2 R(r)\\Theta(\\theta) = 0 $$\nTo separate the variables, we multiply by $\\frac{r^2}{R(r)\\Theta(\\theta)}$:\n$$ \\frac{r}{R(r)}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{dR}{dr}\\right) + k^2 r^2 = -\\frac{1}{\\Theta(\\theta)}\\frac{d^2\\Theta}{d\\theta^2} $$\nThe left side of the equation depends only on $r$, and the right side depends only on $\\theta$. For the equality to hold for all $r$ and $\\theta$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we shall call $\\lambda$.\n\nThis gives two ordinary differential equations:\n1. The angular equation: $\\frac{d^2\\Theta}{d\\theta^2} + \\lambda\\Theta = 0$\n2. The radial equation: $\\frac{r}{R}\\frac{d}{dr}(r\\frac{dR}{dr}) + k^2 r^2 = \\lambda$, which can be rewritten as $r^2\\frac{d^2R}{dr^2} + r\\frac{dR}{dr} + (k^2 r^2 - \\lambda)R = 0$.\n\nFor the angular equation, the physical nature of the problem dictates that the solution must be periodic in $\\theta$ with period $2\\pi$, i.e., $\\Theta(\\theta + 2\\pi) = \\Theta(\\theta)$. This condition requires the separation constant $\\lambda$ to be the square of a non-negative integer, $\\lambda = m^2$, where $m \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The integer $m$ is known as the azimuthal index. The general solution for $\\Theta(\\theta)$ is then a linear combination of sinusoids:\n$$ \\Theta(\\theta) = A_m\\cos(m\\theta) + B_m\\sin(m\\theta) $$\n\nSubstituting $\\lambda = m^2$ into the radial equation gives:\n$$ r^2\\frac{d^2R}{dr^2} + r\\frac{dR}{dr} + (k^2 r^2 - m^2)R = 0 $$\nThis is Bessel's differential equation. Its general solution is a linear combination of the Bessel function of the first kind, $J_m(kr)$, and the Bessel function of the second kind, $Y_m(kr)$:\n$$ R(r) = C_m J_m(kr) + D_m Y_m(kr) $$\nThe problem requires a solution that is regular (i.e., finite) everywhere in the domain, including the origin $r=0$. The Bessel function of the second kind, $Y_m(kr)$, is singular at $kr=0$. Therefore, to ensure a physically meaningful, finite pressure field at the center of the disk, we must set the coefficient $D_m=0$. The radial solution is thus restricted to:\n$$ R(r) = C_m J_m(kr) $$\n\nThe general form of a single mode of the solution is $p_m(r, \\theta) = J_m(kr) (A_m\\cos(m\\theta) + B_m\\sin(m\\theta))$, where the constant $C_m$ has been absorbed into $A_m$ and $B_m$. A non-trivial solution ($p \\not\\equiv 0$) requires that for some $m$, at least one of $A_m$ or $B_m$ is non-zero. The characteristic wavenumbers $k$ are the specific values for which such non-trivial solutions exist under the given homogeneous boundary conditions.\n\n**1. Dirichlet (Sound-Soft) Boundary Condition**\nThe boundary condition is $p(a, \\theta) = 0$. For a single mode, this translates to:\n$$ J_m(ka) (A_m\\cos(m\\theta) + B_m\\sin(m\\theta)) = 0 $$\nFor this to hold for all $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ with at least one of $A_m, B_m$ being non-zero, we must have:\n$$ J_m(ka) = 0 $$\nLet $j_{m,n}$ be the $n$-th positive root of the Bessel function $J_m(x)$, with $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The condition $J_m(ka)=0$ implies that the argument $ka$ must be equal to one of these roots.\n$$ ka = j_{m,n} $$\nThis defines the discrete set of characteristic wavenumbers for the Dirichlet problem:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{D}}(m,n) = \\frac{j_{m,n}}{a} $$\n\n**2. Neumann (Sound-Hard) Boundary Condition**\nThe boundary condition is $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r}\\big|_{r=a} = 0$. We first compute the radial derivative of a single mode:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p_m}{\\partial r} = \\frac{d}{dr}[J_m(kr)] (A_m\\cos(m\\theta) + B_m\\sin(m\\theta)) = k J_m'(kr) (A_m\\cos(m\\theta) + B_m\\sin(m\\theta)) $$\nwhere $J_m'(x)$ is the derivative of $J_m(x)$ with respect to its argument $x$. Evaluating at $r=a$ and setting to zero gives:\n$$ k J_m'(ka) (A_m\\cos(m\\theta) + B_m\\sin(m\\theta)) = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($k \\neq 0$), we must have:\n$$ J_m'(ka) = 0 $$\nLet $j_{m,n}'$ be the $n$-th positive root of the derivative $J_m'(x)$, with $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The condition implies that the argument $ka$ must be one of these roots. Note that for $m \\ge 1$, $x=0$ is a root of $J_m'(x)$, but this corresponds to the trivial case $k=0$, which is excluded by the definition of $j'_{m,n}$ as positive roots. For $m=0, J_0'(0)=0$, also a trivial case. The problem specifies $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots\\}$ for positive roots, so we only consider $k>0$.\n$$ ka = j_{m,n}' $$\nThis defines the discrete set of characteristic wavenumbers for the Neumann problem:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{N}}(m,n) = \\frac{j_{m,n}'}{a} $$\n\n**3. Multiplicity of Characteristic Wavenumbers**\nThe multiplicity $\\mu$ of a characteristic wavenumber is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (or modes) corresponding to that wavenumber. The eigenfunctions are $p_{m,n}(r, \\theta) = J_m(k(m,n)r) \\Theta_m(\\theta)$. The multiplicity is determined by the dimension of the solution space for the angular function $\\Theta_m(\\theta)$. We assume no accidental degeneracies (i.e., $k(m,n) \\neq k(m',n')$ for $(m,n) \\neq (m',n')$).\n- For $m=0$ (radially symmetric modes): The angular solution is $\\Theta_0(\\theta) = A_0\\cos(0) + B_0\\sin(0) = A_0$, which is a constant. There is only one linearly independent angular function (the constant function). Thus, for each wavenumber $k(0,n)$, there is one eigenfunction. The multiplicity is $\\mu(0) = 1$.\n- For $m > 0$ (azimuthal modes): The angular solution is $\\Theta_m(\\theta) = A_m\\cos(m\\theta) + B_m\\sin(m\\theta)$. The functions $\\cos(m\\theta)$ and $\\sin(m\\theta)$ are linearly independent for any integer $m \\ge 1$. This means that for each wavenumber $k(m,n)$ with $m \\ge 1$, there are two linearly independent eigenfunctions: one proportional to $\\cos(m\\theta)$ and another to $\\sin(m\\theta)$. The multiplicity is $\\mu(m) = 2$ for $m \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n\nWe can express the multiplicity $\\mu(m)$ for $m \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$ in a single expression using the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ij}$, which is $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ otherwise.\n$$ \\mu(m) = 2 - \\delta_{m0} $$\n\nThe three requested expressions are $k_{\\mathrm{D}}(m,n)$, $k_{\\mathrm{N}}(m,n)$, and $\\mu(m)$.",

By the given jump relation, this is equivalent to finding a $\\mu_{\\ell m}$ such that the double-layer potential it generates has a zero interior trace: $\\gamma^{-} (D_{k}\\mu_{\\ell m}) = 0$.\n\nLet's follow a constructive approach starting from the provided interior Dirichlet eigenfunction.\nLet $u_{in}(\\mathbf{x}) = u_{\\ell m}(\\mathbf{x}) = j_{\\ell}(kr)Y_{\\ell}^{m}(\\theta, \\phi)$ be the interior eigenfunction, where $\\mathbf{x}$ is represented by spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$.

This potential satisfies the Helmholtz equation in the exterior domain $\\Omega^{+} = \\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : |\\mathbf{x}| > a\\}$ and fulfills the Sommerfeld radiation condition. Since its trace on the boundary is zero, i.e., $\\gamma^{+}w = V_k(g) = 0$, $w$ is the solution to the exterior Dirichlet problem with zero boundary data. By the uniqueness theorem for the exterior Dirichlet problem, the only radiating solution is the trivial one. Thus, $w(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all $\\mathbf{x}$ in the exterior domain $\\Omega^{+}$.\n\nSince the potential $w(\\mathbf{x})$ is zero everywhere in the exterior, its normal derivative on the boundary from the exterior must also be zero:\n$$\n\\gamma^{+} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial n} = 0.\n$$\nThe jump relation for the normal derivative of the single-layer potential states:\n$$\n\\gamma^{+} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n} (V_k \\lambda) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} I + K_k'\\right)\\lambda,\n$$\nwhere $K_k'$ is the adjoint of the double-layer operator, defined by\n$$\n(K_k' \\lambda)(\\mathbf{x}) = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\frac{\\partial G_k(\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{x})}{\\partial n_{\\mathbf{x}}} \\lambda(\\mathbf{y}) \\mathrm{d}S_{\\mathbf{y}}.\n$$\nApplying this relation to our density $g$, we have $\\gamma^{+} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial n} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} I + K_k'\\right)g$.

The problem, however, concerns the operator with $K_k$. For a general boundary, $K_k' \\neq K_k$. However, for a sphere, the kernel of the double-layer operator is symmetric. The kernel is $\\frac{\\partial G_k(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})}{\\partial n_{\\mathbf{y}}}$. Let $\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in \\Gamma$.

The kernel of $K_k'$ involves $\\frac{\\partial G_k(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial n_{\\mathbf{x}}}$. Since $G_k(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) = G_k(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{x})$, we only need to compare the directional derivatives.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_{\\mathbf{y}}} |\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}| = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}}|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}| \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{\\mathbf{y}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{x}}{|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{y}}{a} = \\frac{a^2 - \\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{y}}{a|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|}.\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_{\\mathbf{x}}} |\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{x}| = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}|\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{x}| \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}}{|\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{x}|} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{a} = \\frac{a^2 - \\mathbf{y}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}}{a|\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{x}|}.\n$$\nThe expressions are identical. As the kernel of $G_k$ depends only on the distance $|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|$, the kernels of the operators $K_k$ and $K_k'$ are identical for a spherical boundary: $\\frac{\\partial G_k(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})}{\\partial n_{\\mathbf{y}}} = \\frac{\\partial G_k(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial n_{\\mathbf{x}}}$.

The roots are $z_{0s} = s\\pi$.\n  - $z_{01} = \\pi \\approx 3.14159$\n  - $z_{02} = 2\\pi \\approx 6.28318$\n- For $n=1$: $j_1(z) = \\frac{\\sin(z)}{z^2} - \\frac{\\cos(z)}{z}$. The roots are solutions to $\\tan(z)=z$.\n  - $z_{11} \\approx 4.49341$\n- For $n=2$: $j_2(z) = (\\frac{3}{z^2}-1)\\frac{\\sin(z)}{z} - \\frac{3\\cos(z)}{z^2}$.\n  - $z_{21} \\approx 5.76346$\n- For $n=3$:\n  - $z_{31} \\approx 6.98793$\n\nOrdering these roots by increasing value gives the sequence for the first four characteristic frequencies:\n1. First eigenfrequency corresponds to $z_{01} = \\pi$, with $n=0$.\n2. Second eigenfrequency corresponds to $z_{11} \\approx 4.493$, with $n=1$.\n3. Third eigenfrequency corresponds to $z_{21} \\approx 5.763$, with $n=2$.\n4. Fourth eigenfrequency corresponds to $z_{02} = 2\\pi$, with $n=0$.\n\nNow we calculate the minimal number of CHIEF points, $2n+1$, for each of these cases:\n1. For the 1st eigenfrequency ($n=0$): Number of points = $2(0)+1 = 1$.\n2. For the 2nd eigenfrequency ($n=1$): Number of points = $2(1)+1 = 3$.\n3. For the 3rd eigenfrequency ($n=2$): Number of points = $2(2)+1 = 5$.\n4. For the 4th eigenfrequency ($n=0$): Number of points = $2(0)+1 = 1$.\n\nThe resulting sequence of minimal CHIEF-point counts is $(1, 3, 5, 1)$.\n\nRegarding the spatial selection of CHIEF points, the goal is to choose a set of interior points $\\{\\mathbf{r}_j\\}$, for $j=1, \\dots, 2n+1$, such that the constraint matrix with elements $M_{jm} = \\psi_{nm}(\\mathbf{r}_j) = j_n(k_{ns} |\\mathbf{r}_j|) Y_n^m(\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_j)$ is non-singular. Since the radial part $j_n(k_{ns}r)$ is a common factor for a given $j$, the crucial part is the angular dependence from the spherical harmonics $Y_n^m(\\theta, \\phi)$. The selected points must not lie on a geometric configuration that corresponds to the nodal surfaces of any non-trivial linear combination of the $2n+1$ spherical harmonics spanning the nullspace. For example, for the $n=1$ case, the nullspace basis functions are related to the Cartesian components $x$, $y$, and $z$. Placing the required $3$ points on a single line passing through the origin would be a degenerate configuration, as they would not be linearly independent with respect to the basis. Generally, placing the points randomly within the sphere's volume is a robust practical strategy to avoid such degeneracies, ensuring that the resulting constraint matrix has full rank and successfully eliminates the nullspace.",
