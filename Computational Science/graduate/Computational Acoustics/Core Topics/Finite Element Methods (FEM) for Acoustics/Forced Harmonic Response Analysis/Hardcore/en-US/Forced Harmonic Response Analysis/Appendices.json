            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional forced harmonic response of small-amplitude acoustic pressure in a homogeneous, isotropic, thermoviscous fluid, where the medium’s losses are modeled by an effective complex wavenumber. The governing linear acoustics start from the linearized momentum balance and mass conservation under small perturbations: the linearized Euler equation $\\,\\rho_{0}\\,\\partial \\mathbf{v}/\\partial t=-\\nabla p\\,$ and the linearized continuity equation $\\,\\partial \\rho'/\\partial t+\\rho_{0}\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=0\\,$, together with the linear equation of state $\\,p=c^{2}\\rho'\\,$. Under time-harmonic forcing at angular frequency $\\omega$, the steady-state field $p(\\mathbf{x},t)$ admits a phasor form with harmonic time dependence and spatial variation $p(x)=\\widehat{p}\\,\\exp(i\\,k\\,x)$ that solves the forced Helmholtz-type equation in the exterior of the source region. In a lossy medium, the wavenumber is complex, $k=k'+i\\,k''$, with real part $k'$ and imaginary part $k''$, and the forced harmonic response exhibits spatial amplitude decay governed by $k''$.\n\nStarting from these fundamentals, derive the plane-wave spatial behavior implied by the complex wavenumber and use it to define the penetration depth $\\delta$ as the distance where the pressure amplitude decays by a factor $\\exp(-1)$ from its value at the source plane.

Use meters for $\\delta$ and decibels for the attenuation. Your final answer must be a single row vector containing the two numbers in the order specified.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear acoustics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively stated. It correctly describes the forced harmonic response in a thermoviscous fluid using a complex wavenumber, which is a standard model for attenuation in wave physics. The required calculations are direct applications of the provided definitions.\n\nThe problem describes a one-dimensional pressure plane wave propagating in the $x$-direction. The spatial part of the complex pressure amplitude, $\\hat{p}(x)$, is given in the form:\n$$\n\\hat{p}(x) = \\hat{p}_s \\exp(i k x)\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{p}_s$ is the complex pressure amplitude at the source plane ($x=0$) and $k$ is the complex wavenumber. The problem states that the wavenumber is $k = k' + i k''$, where $k'$ is the real part and $k''$ is the imaginary part. We are given the values $k' = 400 \\, \\text{rad/m}$ and $k'' = 25 \\, \\text{m}^{-1}$.\n\nSubstituting the complex wavenumber into the expression for $\\hat{p}(x)$ gives:\n$$\n\\hat{p}(x) = \\hat{p}_s \\exp(i(k' + i k'')x) = \\hat{p}_s \\exp(ik'x + i^2 k''x) = \\hat{p}_s \\exp(-k''x) \\exp(ik'x)\n$$\nThe magnitude of the complex pressure, which represents the pressure amplitude $A(x)$, is:\n$$\nA(x) = |\\hat{p}(x)| = |\\hat{p}_s \\exp(-k''x) \\exp(ik'x)| = |\\hat{p}_s| \\cdot |\\exp(-k''x)| \\cdot |\\exp(ik'x)|\n$$\nLet $A_0 = |\\hat{p}_s|$ be the pressure amplitude at $x=0$. Since $k''$ and $x$ are real, $|\\exp(-k''x)| = \\exp(-k''x)$. The term $|\\exp(ik'x)| = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(k'x) + \\sin^2(k'x)} = 1$. Therefore, the pressure amplitude as a function of distance is:\n$$\nA(x) = A_0 \\exp(-k''x)\n$$\nThis equation describes an exponential decay of the wave amplitude with distance, governed by the imaginary part of the wavenumber, $k''$.\n\nFirst, we compute the penetration depth $\\delta$. This is defined as the distance over which the pressure amplitude decays by a factor of $\\exp(-1)$ from its initial value. We set the ratio of the amplitude at $x=\\delta$ to the amplitude at $x=0$ equal to $\\exp(-1)$:\n$$\n\\frac{A(\\delta)}{A_0} = \\frac{A_0 \\exp(-k''\\delta)}{A_0} = \\exp(-k''\\delta)\n$$\nSetting this equal to the required decay factor:\n$$\n\\exp(-k''\\delta) = \\exp(-1)\n$$\nEquating the exponents yields:\n$$\n-k''\\delta = -1 \\implies \\delta = \\frac{1}{k''}\n$$\nUsing the given value $k''=25 \\, \\text{m}^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{1}{25 \\, \\text{m}^{-1}} = 0.04 \\, \\text{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures, so $\\delta = 0.04000 \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nSecond, we compute the attenuation of the pressure amplitude in decibels per wavelength.

The change in signal level in decibels between two points is $20 \\log_{10}(A_2/A_1)$. Attenuation is the magnitude of this change for $A_2 < A_1$, or more commonly, $20 \\log_{10}(A_1/A_2)$. We are interested in the attenuation over one wavelength, so we compare the amplitude at a point $x$ with the amplitude at $x+\\lambda$. Let $A_1 = A(x)$ and $A_2 = A(x+\\lambda)$.\n$$\n\\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\frac{A(x)}{A(x+\\lambda)} = \\frac{A_0 \\exp(-k''x)}{A_0 \\exp(-k''(x+\\lambda))} = \\frac{\\exp(-k''x)}{\\exp(-k''x - k''\\lambda)} = \\exp(k''\\lambda)\n$$\nThe attenuation in decibels per wavelength, $\\alpha_{\\lambda}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\lambda} = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{A(x)}{A(x+\\lambda)}\\right) = 20 \\log_{10}(\\exp(k''\\lambda))\n$$\nUsing the logarithm identity $\\log_b(a^c) = c \\log_b(a)$ and the change of base formula $\\log_{10}(z) = \\frac{\\ln(z)}{\\ln(10)}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\lambda} = 20 (k''\\lambda) \\log_{10}(e) = 20 (k''\\lambda) \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)}\n$$\nNow, substitute $\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{k'}$ into the expression for $\\alpha_{\\lambda}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\lambda} = \\frac{20 k''}{\\ln(10)} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{k'}\\right) = \\frac{40 \\pi k''}{k' \\ln(10)}\n$$\nWe substitute the given numerical values, $k' = 400 \\, \\text{rad/m}$ and $k'' = 25 \\, \\text{m}^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\lambda} = \\frac{40 \\pi (25)}{(400) \\ln(10)} = \\frac{1000 \\pi}{400 \\ln(10)} = \\frac{2.5 \\pi}{\\ln(10)}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\lambda} \\approx \\frac{2.5 \\times 3.14159265...}{2.30258509...} \\approx \\frac{7.85398163...}{2.30258509...} \\approx 3.411153... \\, \\text{dB/wavelength}\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $\\alpha_{\\lambda} = 3.411 \\, \\text{dB/wavelength}$.\n\nThe two computed quantities are the penetration depth $\\delta=0.04000 \\, \\text{m}$ and the attenuation per wavelength $\\alpha_{\\lambda}=3.411 \\, \\text{dB}$.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system with hysteretic (structural) damping, a common model in mechanical vibrations and acoustics. All necessary parameters are provided, and the objective is clearly stated.\n\nLet $x(t)$ be the displacement of the piston from its equilibrium position. The system is driven by a harmonic force $F(t) = \\Re\\{F_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)\\}$. We adopt the linear time-harmonic ansatz for the displacement, $x(t) = \\Re\\{X_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)\\}$, where $X_0$ is the complex amplitude of the displacement. The velocity and acceleration are then $\\dot{x}(t) = \\Re\\{i\\omega X_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)\\}$ and $\\ddot{x}(t) = \\Re\\{-\\omega^2 X_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)\\}$, respectively.\n\nNewton's second law for the SDOF system is given by the balance of forces:\n$$ m \\ddot{x}(t) + F_{restoring}(t) = F(t) $$\nwhere $m\\ddot{x}(t)$ is the inertial force and $F_{restoring}(t)$ is the restoring force from the support.\n\nThe problem states that the support has a complex stiffness $k_{eff} = k(1+i\\eta)$. In the frequency domain, this means the complex amplitude of the restoring force, $F_{r,0}$, is related to the complex amplitude of the displacement, $X_0$, by $F_{r,0} = k(1+i\\eta)X_0$.\n\nBy substituting the complex representations of the forces and motion into Newton's second law, we obtain the equation of motion in the frequency domain:\n$$ m(-\\omega^2 X_0) + k(1+i\\eta)X_0 = F_0 $$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$ \\left( -m\\omega^2 + k(1+i\\eta) \\right) X_0 = F_0 $$\n\n### Derivation of the Homogeneous Frequency Condition\n\nThe complex resonance frequencies of the system correspond to the frequencies of free vibration, where the external force is zero ($F_0=0$). The homogeneous equation is:\n$$ \\left( -m\\omega^2 + k(1+i\\eta) \\right) X_0 = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($X_0 \\neq 0$), the term in the parenthesis must be zero. Let $\\tilde{\\omega}$ denote the complex resonance angular frequency. The condition is:\n$$ -m\\tilde{\\omega}^2 + k(1+i\\eta) = 0 $$\nRearranging this equation gives the homogeneous frequency condition:\n$$ \\tilde{\\omega}^2 = \\frac{k}{m}(1+i\\eta) $$\nIntroducing the undamped natural angular frequency $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{k/m}$, the condition becomes:\n$$ \\tilde{\\omega}^2 = \\omega_0^2(1+i\\eta) $$\n\n### Effect of the Structural Loss Factor $\\eta$\n\nThe presence of the structural loss factor $\\eta > 0$ makes the right-hand side of the frequency condition complex. Consequently, the resonance frequency $\\tilde{\\omega}$ must also be complex. Let $\\tilde{\\omega} = \\omega_r + i\\omega_i$. A complex frequency signifies that the system's free vibrations are not purely oscillatory but are damped sinusoids of the form $\\exp(i\\tilde{\\omega}t) = \\exp(-\\omega_i t) \\exp(i\\omega_r t)$. The positive imaginary part $\\omega_i > 0$ represents temporal decay, which is characteristic of a stable, energy-dissipating system.\n\nTo see how $\\eta$ reduces acoustic radiation peaks, we examine the steady-state velocity amplitude under forced excitation. The displacement amplitude is:\n$$ X_0(\\omega) = \\frac{F_0}{-m\\omega^2 + k(1+i\\eta)} = \\frac{F_0}{(k - m\\omega^2) + i k\\eta} $$\nThe velocity amplitude is $V_0(\\omega) = i\\omega X_0(\\omega)$. The magnitude of the velocity amplitude is:\n$$ |V_0(\\omega)| = \\frac{\\omega |F_0|}{|(k - m\\omega^2) + i k\\eta|} = \\frac{\\omega |F_0|}{\\sqrt{(k - m\\omega^2)^2 + (k\\eta)^2}} $$\nThe resonance peak in the response occurs at the frequency where the denominator is minimal. For the hysteretic damping model, the displacement amplitude $|X_0(\\omega)|$ is maximized when $k - m\\omega^2=0$, which occurs at $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m} = \\omega_0$. At this frequency, the velocity amplitude is:\n$$ |V_0(\\omega_0)| = \\frac{\\omega_0 |F_0|}{\\sqrt{0^2 + (k\\eta)^2}} = \\frac{\\omega_0 |F_0|}{k\\eta} $$\nIn the absence of damping ($\\eta \\to 0$), the velocity amplitude at resonance would become infinite. The structural loss factor $\\eta$ makes the resonant velocity amplitude finite and inversely proportional to $\\eta$. Since the radiated acoustic power is proportional to the square of the piston velocity amplitude, the damping serves to limit the radiation peaks at resonance.\n\n### Quantification of the Complex Fractional Frequency Shift\n\nThe problem requires finding the complex fractional shift $\\Delta\\omega/\\omega_0$ to leading order in $\\eta$, where $\\Delta\\omega = \\tilde{\\omega} - \\omega_0$.\nFrom the homogeneous frequency condition, we have:\n$$ \\tilde{\\omega} = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{1+i\\eta} $$\nWe select the principal root, which has a positive real part, consistent with the definition of $\\omega_0>0$.\n\nThe fractional shift is given by:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{\\omega_0} = \\frac{\\tilde{\\omega} - \\omega_0}{\\omega_0} = \\frac{\\tilde{\\omega}}{\\omega_0} - 1 = \\sqrt{1+i\\eta} - 1 $$\nSince we are given that $\\eta \\ll 1$, we can use the binomial series expansion for $(1+z)^n$ around $z=0$, where $z=i\\eta$ and $n=1/2$:\n$$ (1+z)^n = 1 + nz + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2!}z^2 + O(z^3) $$\nTo find the leading-order term of the shift, we need the expansion up to the first order in $z$:\n$$ (1+i\\eta)^{1/2} \\approx 1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(i\\eta) $$\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for the fractional shift:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{\\omega_0} \\approx \\left(1 + i\\frac{\\eta}{2}\\right) - 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{\\omega_0} \\approx i\\frac{\\eta}{2} $$\nThis expression represents the complex fractional shift to leading order in $\\eta$. The shift is purely imaginary at this order, indicating that to first order, the damping affects the decay rate of oscillations but not their frequency. The change in the real part of the frequency is of order $\\eta^2$, which can be seen by carrying the expansion to the next term: $(1+i\\eta)^{1/2} \\approx 1 + i\\frac{\\eta}{2} - \\frac{\\eta^2}{8}$. The shift would then be $\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{\\omega_0} \\approx -\\frac{\\eta^2}{8} + i\\frac{\\eta}{2}$. The leading-order term is the one with the lowest power of $\\eta$, which is the imaginary term of order $\\eta^1$.",

The peak magnitude squared is then approximated as:\n$$\n|H(\\omega_{\\text{peak}})|^2 \\approx |H(\\omega_p)|^2 = \\frac{|R|^2}{(\\omega_p^2 - \\omega_p^2)^2 + 4\\,\\zeta^2\\,\\omega_p^2\\,\\omega_p^2} = \\frac{|R|^2}{4\\,\\zeta^2\\,\\omega_p^4}\n$$\nThe half-power condition becomes:\n$$\n|H(\\omega_{\\pm})|^2 = \\frac{|R|^2}{(\\omega_p^2 - \\omega_{\\pm}^2)^2 + 4\\,\\zeta^2\\,\\omega_p^2\\,\\omega_{\\pm}^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{|R|^2}{4\\,\\zeta^2\\,\\omega_p^4} = \\frac{|R|^2}{8\\,\\zeta^2\\,\\omega_p^4}\n$$\nThis implies:\n$$\n(\\omega_p^2 - \\omega_{\\pm}^2)^2 + 4\\,\\zeta^2\\,\\omega_p^2\\,\\omega_{\\pm}^2 = 8\\,\\zeta^2\\,\\omega_p^4\n$$\nWe seek solutions $\\omega_{\\pm}$ near $\\omega_p$. We can make the following approximations, valid for $\\omega \\approx \\omega_p$:\n1. $\\omega_p^2 - \\omega^2 = (\\omega_p - \\omega)(\\omega_p + \\omega) \\approx (\\omega_p - \\omega)(2\\omega_p)$.\n2. In the damping term, which is already small due to the factor $\\zeta^2$, we can approximate $\\omega_{\\pm} \\approx \\omega_p$.\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$$\n\\left( (\\omega_p - \\omega_{\\pm})(2\\omega_p) \\right)^2 + 4\\,\\zeta^2\\,\\omega_p^2(\\omega_p^2) \\approx 8\\,\\zeta^2\\,\\omega_p^4\n$$\n$$\n4\\omega_p^2(\\omega_p - \\omega_{\\pm})^2 + 4\\,\\zeta^2\\,\\omega_p^4 \\approx 8\\,\\zeta^2\\,\\omega_p^4\n$$\n$$\n4\\omega_p^2(\\omega_p - \\omega_{\\pm})^2 \\approx 4\\,\\zeta^2\\,\\omega_p^4\n$$\n$$\n(\\omega_p - \\omega_{\\pm})^2 \\approx \\zeta^2\\,\\omega_p^2\n$$\nTaking the square root gives:\n$$\n\\omega_p - \\omega_{\\pm} \\approx \\pm \\zeta\\omega_p \\implies \\omega_{\\pm} \\approx \\omega_p \\mp \\zeta\\omega_p\n$$\nThus, the two half-power frequencies are $\\omega_{+} = \\omega_p + \\zeta\\omega_p$ and $\\omega_{-} = \\omega_p - \\zeta\\omega_p$.\nThe half-power bandwidth $\\Delta\\omega$ is the difference between these two frequencies:\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega = \\omega_{+} - \\omega_{-} = (\\omega_p + \\zeta\\omega_p) - (\\omega_p - \\zeta\\omega_p) = 2\\zeta\\omega_p\n$$\nThis is the first-order asymptotic estimate for the bandwidth.\n\n**3) Interpretation of the Role of the Complex Modal Residue $R$**\n\nThe complex modal residue $R$ appears in the expression for the FRF as a multiplicative constant. Let $R = |R|\\exp(i\\phi_R)$.\n\nThe derivative $\\frac{d}{d\\omega}|H(\\omega)|^2$ contains the term $|R|^2$ as a simple multiplicative factor. The extremum condition $\\frac{d}{d\\omega}|H(\\omega)|^2=0$ leads to the equation $\\omega^2 - \\omega_p^2(1 - 2\\,\\zeta^2) = 0$. This equation, which determines the peak frequency $\\omega_{\\text{peak}}$, is completely independent of $R$ (both its magnitude and phase).\n\nSimilarly, the half-power condition $|H(\\omega_{\\pm})|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}|H(\\omega_{\\text{peak}})|^2$ can be written as $\\frac{|R|^2}{D(\\omega_{\\pm})} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{|R|^2}{D(\\omega_{\\text{peak}})}$. The term $|R|^2$ cancels from both sides, leaving an equation $D(\\omega_{\\pm}) = 2D(\\omega_{\\text{peak}})$ that depends only on the denominator parameters $\\omega_p$ and $\\zeta$. Therefore, the half-power frequencies $\\omega_{\\pm}$ and the resulting bandwidth $\\Delta\\omega$ are also independent of $R$.\n\nThe role of $R$ is as follows:\n- The magnitude $|R|$ acts as a scaling factor for the entire amplitude response. The peak amplitude is $|H(\\omega_{\\text{peak}})| \\approx \\frac{|R|}{2\\zeta\\omega_p^2}$. Thus, $|R|$ determines the height of the resonance peak but not its location or relative width. Physically, it represents the strength of the coupling between the source, the receiver, and the mode.\n- The phase $\\phi_R$ of the complex residue $R$ adds a constant phase offset to the overall phase response of the system, $\\arg(H(\\omega)) = \\phi_R - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2\\zeta\\omega_p\\omega}{\\omega_p^2 - \\omega^2}\\right)$. It does not affect the magnitude response curve.\n\nIn summary, the shape of the normalized resonance curve (i.e., its center frequency and relative width) is determined by the system's intrinsic properties $\\omega_p$ and $\\zeta$. The residue $R$ determines the absolute amplitude and phase of the response at a specific source-receiver pair.\n\n**4) Numerical Calculation of Half-Power Bandwidth $\\Delta\\omega$**\n\nGiven the parameters:\n- Natural frequency $\\omega_p = 2\\pi \\times 800 \\, \\mathrm{rad/s}$\n- Damping ratio $\\zeta = 0.015$\n\nUsing the derived first-order asymptotic estimate for the half-power bandwidth:\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega = 2\\zeta\\omega_p\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega = 2 \\times 0.015 \\times (2\\pi \\times 800)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega = 0.03 \\times 1600\\pi\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega = 48\\pi\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega \\approx 150.796447... \\, \\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega \\approx 150.8 \\, \\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$",
