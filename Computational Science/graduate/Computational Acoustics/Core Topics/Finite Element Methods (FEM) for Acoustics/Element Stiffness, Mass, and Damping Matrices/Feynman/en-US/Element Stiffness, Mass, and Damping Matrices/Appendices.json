The problem is to find $\\hat{p} \\in H^{1}(\\Omega)$ such that for all $v \\in H^{1}(\\Omega)$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\left( -\\nabla^{2} \\hat{p} - \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{c^{2}} \\hat{p} \\right) v \\, \\mathrm{d}V = 0\n$$\nApplying Green's first identity, and assuming homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions ($\\nabla \\hat{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$), which are implicit in the given discrete system form, we get the weak formulation:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\hat{p} \\cdot \\nabla v \\, \\mathrm{d}V - \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{c^{2}} \\int_{\\Omega} \\hat{p} v \\, \\mathrm{d}V = 0\n$$\nIn the Galerkin finite element method, the unknown pressure amplitude field $\\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x})$ and the test function $v(\\mathbf{x})$ are approximated as linear combinations of a set of $n$ basis functions $\\{\\varphi_{j}(\\mathbf{x})\\}_{j=1}^{n}$:\n$$\n\\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^{n} u_{j} \\varphi_{j}(\\mathbf{x}), \\qquad v(\\mathbf{x}) = \\varphi_{i}(\\mathbf{x})\n$$\nSubstituting these into the weak form leads to a system of linear equations for the coefficients $\\mathbf{u} = (u_1, \\dots, u_n)^T$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\varphi_{i} \\cdot \\nabla \\varphi_{j} \\, \\mathrm{d}V \\right) u_{j} - \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{c^{2}} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( \\int_{\\Omega} \\varphi_{i} \\varphi_{j} \\, \\mathrm{d}V \\right) u_{j} = 0\n$$\nThis is the matrix system $(K - \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{c^{2}} M) \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}$, where the entries of the stiffness matrix $K$ and mass matrix $M$ are given by:\n$$\nK_{ij} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\varphi_{i} \\cdot \\nabla \\varphi_{j} \\, \\mathrm{d}V, \\qquad M_{ij} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\varphi_{i} \\varphi_{j} \\, \\mathrm{d}V\n$$\nNow, we perform a nondimensionalization using the change of variables $\\mathbf{x} = L\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}$, where $L$ is a characteristic length. This maps the physical domain $\\Omega$ to a nondimensional domain $\\tilde{\\Omega}$. The differential volume element transforms as $\\mathrm{d}V = L^{d} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{V}$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension.\nThe gradient operator transforms according to the chain rule:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\nabla_{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}}\n$$\nThe basis functions $\\{\\varphi_j\\}$ are defined over the physical domain $\\Omega$. We define a corresponding set of basis functions $\\{\\tilde{\\varphi}_j\\}$ on the nondimensional domain $\\tilde{\\Omega}$ such that $\\varphi_{j}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\tilde{\\varphi}_{j}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}})$. This is a standard choice in finite element implementations, where a single reference element is used for all elements in the physical mesh.\n\nLet's apply this change of variables to the stiffness matrix entries $K_{ij}$:\n$$\nK_{ij} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} \\varphi_{i}(\\mathbf{x}) \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} \\varphi_{j}(\\mathbf{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V\n$$\nSubstituting the transformed quantities:\n$$\nK_{ij} = \\int_{\\tilde{\\Omega}} \\left( \\frac{1}{L} \\nabla_{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{i}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}) \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{L} \\nabla_{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{j}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}) \\right) (L^{d} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{V})\n$$\n$$\nK_{ij} = \\frac{L^{d}}{L^{2}} \\int_{\\tilde{\\Omega}} \\nabla_{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{i}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}) \\cdot \\nabla_{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{j}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{V} = L^{d-2} \\tilde{K}_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $\\tilde{K}_{ij} = \\int_{\\tilde{\\Omega}} \\nabla_{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{i} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{j} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{V}$ is an entry of the nondimensional stiffness matrix $\\tilde{K}$. Thus, the stiffness matrix scales as $K = L^{d-2} \\tilde{K}$. The scaling factor is $a_{K} = L^{d-2}$.\n\nNext, we apply the change of variables to the mass matrix entries $M_{ij}$:\n$$\nM_{ij} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\varphi_{i}(\\mathbf{x}) \\varphi_{j}(\\mathbf{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V\n$$\nSubstituting the transformed quantities:\n$$\nM_{ij} = \\int_{\\tilde{\\Omega}} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{i}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}) \\tilde{\\varphi}_{j}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}) (L^{d} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{V})\n$$\n$$\nM_{ij} = L^{d} \\int_{\\tilde{\\Omega}} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{i}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}) \\tilde{\\varphi}_{j}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{V} = L^{d} \\tilde{M}_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $\\tilde{M}_{ij} = \\int_{\\tilde{\\Omega}} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{i} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{j} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{V}$ is an entry of the nondimensional mass matrix $\\tilde{M}$. Thus, the mass matrix scales as $M = L^{d} \\tilde{M}$. The scaling factor is $a_{M} = L^{d}$.\n\nNow we substitute these scaled matrices back into the discrete system:\n$$\nK - \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{c^{2}} M = L^{d-2}\\tilde{K} - \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{c^{2}} (L^{d}\\tilde{M})\n$$\nWe factor out the term $L^{d-2}$ to match the desired form:\n$$\nK - \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{c^{2}} M = L^{d-2} \\left( \\tilde{K} - \\frac{\\omega^{2} L^{d}}{c^{2} L^{d-2}} \\tilde{M} \\right) = L^{d-2} \\left( \\tilde{K} - \\frac{\\omega^{2} L^{2}}{c^{2}} \\tilde{M} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression matches the target form $S(L) ( \\tilde{K} - \\kappa^{2} \\tilde{M} )$, where we identify the prefactor $S(L) = L^{d-2}$ and the squared nondimensional wavenumber $\\kappa^{2} = (\\omega L / c)^{2}$. The nondimensional wavenumber is therefore:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{\\omega L}{c}\n$$\nThe triple of requested quantities is $(a_{K}, a_{M}, \\kappa) = (L^{d-2}, L^{d}, \\frac{\\omega L}{c})$.\n\nRegarding the conditioning, the nondimensionalization improves the numerical stability of the discrete system, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic. In the original system $K - (\\omega^2/c^2)M$, the matrix entries depend on the characteristic length $L$. For $d=3$, $K_{ij} \\sim L$ and $M_{ij} \\sim L^3$. If the physical units are chosen such that $L$ is very large or very small, the magnitudes of the entries in $K$ and $M$ can be vastly different. Furthermore, for large $\\omega$, the term $(\\omega^2/c^2)M$ can become many orders of magnitude larger than $K$. This creates a poorly-balanced matrix where summing terms of disparate magnitudes can lead to a significant loss of precision (catastrophic cancellation), which is a form of numerical ill-conditioning.\n\nBy scaling the problem, we obtain the system $\\tilde{K} - \\kappa^2 \\tilde{M}$. The matrices $\\tilde{K}$ and $\\tilde{M}$ are defined on a reference domain $\\tilde{\\Omega}$ of characteristic size 1. Their entries are independent of the physical units or the absolute scale $L$, and are typically of order one. All the scaling effects from physical length and frequency are isolated into the single, scalar nondimensional parameter $\\kappa = \\omega L / c$. This results in a better-balanced matrix system where the numerical challenge is cleanly represented by the magnitude of $\\kappa$, rather than being convoluted with the choice of units. This separation improves robustness and minimizes precision-related errors that plague badly scaled numerical problems.",

Let $u(t)$ be the generalized transverse displacement of the panel. The equation of motion for this system under an external force $F(t)$ is:\n$$ m \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + c \\frac{du}{dt} + k u = F(t) $$\nThe panel is loaded by a uniform acoustic pressure $p(t)$ over its surface area $A$. The total force is therefore $F(t) = p(t)A$. The equation of motion becomes:\n$$ m \\ddot{u} + c \\dot{u} + k u = p(t)A $$\nWe assume a time-harmonic dependency of the form $\\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t}$ for all dynamic variables. The displacement and pressure can be written as $u(t) = \\hat{u}\\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t}$ and $p(t) = \\hat{p}\\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t}$, where $\\hat{u}$ and $\\hat{p}$ are the complex amplitudes. The time derivatives are $\\dot{u}(t) = \\mathrm{i}\\omega \\hat{u}\\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t}$ and $\\ddot{u}(t) = -\\omega^2 \\hat{u}\\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t}$. Substituting these into the equation of motion and dividing by the common factor $\\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t}$ yields the frequency-domain equation:\n$$ (-\\omega^2 m + \\mathrm{i}\\omega c + k) \\hat{u} = \\hat{p}A $$\nSolving for the complex displacement amplitude $\\hat{u}$ gives:\n$$ \\hat{u} = \\frac{\\hat{p}A}{k - \\omega^2 m + \\mathrm{i}\\omega c} $$\nThe normal particle velocity at the fluid-panel interface, $v_n(t)$, is the time derivative of the panel's displacement, $v_n(t) = \\dot{u}(t)$. In the frequency domain, the complex amplitude of the velocity is $\\hat{v}_n = \\mathrm{i}\\omega \\hat{u}$. Substituting the expression for $\\hat{u}$:\n$$ \\hat{v}_n = \\frac{\\mathrm{i}\\omega \\hat{p}A}{k - \\omega^2 m + \\mathrm{i}\\omega c} $$\nAcoustic impedance $Z(\\omega)$ is defined as the ratio of the complex acoustic pressure amplitude to the complex normal particle velocity amplitude at the boundary:\n$$ Z(\\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{p}}{\\hat{v}_n} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\hat{v}_n$, we find the impedance of the panel:\n$$ Z(\\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{p}}{\\frac{\\mathrm{i}\\omega \\hat{p}A}{k - \\omega^2 m + \\mathrm{i}\\omega c}} = \\frac{k - \\omega^2 m + \\mathrm{i}\\omega c}{\\mathrm{i}\\omega A} $$\nTo find the real and imaginary parts, we separate the terms:\n$$ Z(\\omega) = \\frac{\\mathrm{i}\\omega c}{\\mathrm{i}\\omega A} + \\frac{k - \\omega^2 m}{\\mathrm{i}\\omega A} = \\frac{c}{A} - \\mathrm{i}\\frac{k - \\omega^2 m}{\\omega A} = \\frac{c}{A} + \\mathrm{i}\\left(\\frac{\\omega^2 m - k}{\\omega A}\\right) $$\nThus, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance are:\n$$ \\Re(Z(\\omega)) = \\frac{c}{A} $$\n$$ \\Im(Z(\\omega)) = \\frac{\\omega m}{A} - \\frac{k}{\\omega A} $$\n\n#### Part 2: Derivation of the FEM Boundary Matrix\n\nThe linear acoustic field is governed by the Helmholtz equation for the complex pressure amplitude $\\hat{p}$:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\hat{p} + k_w^2 \\hat{p} = 0 $$\nwhere $k_w = \\omega/c_0$ is the acoustic wavenumber and $c_0$ is the speed of sound in the fluid. The weak form is obtained by multiplying by a test function $w$ and integrating over the fluid domain $\\Omega$:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} (\\nabla^2 \\hat{p} + k_w^2 \\hat{p})w \\,d\\Omega = 0 $$\nApplying Green's first identity to the Laplacian term gives:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} (-\\nabla \\hat{p} \\cdot \\nabla w + k_w^2 \\hat{p}w) \\,d\\Omega + \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} w \\frac{\\partial \\hat{p}}{\\partial n} \\,dS = 0 $$\nThe linearized momentum equation in the frequency domain is $\\nabla \\hat{p} = -\\mathrm{i}\\omega\\rho_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{v}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}$ is the complex particle velocity vector. The normal derivative of pressure is related to the normal particle velocity $\\hat{v}_n$ by:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\hat{p}}{\\partial n} = \\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\nabla \\hat{p} = -\\mathrm{i}\\omega\\rho_0 (\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}) = -\\mathrm{i}\\omega\\rho_0 \\hat{v}_n $$\nUsing the impedance relation $\\hat{p} = Z(\\omega)\\hat{v}_n$, we can express $\\hat{v}_n$ as $\\hat{v}_n = \\hat{p}/Z(\\omega)$. Substituting this into the expression for the pressure gradient gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\hat{p}}{\\partial n} = -\\mathrm{i}\\omega\\rho_0 \\frac{\\hat{p}}{Z(\\omega)} $$\nSubstituting this impedance boundary condition into the boundary integral of the weak form:\n$$ \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} w \\left(-\\mathrm{i}\\omega\\rho_0 \\frac{\\hat{p}}{Z(\\omega)}\\right) \\,dS = -\\mathrm{i}\\omega\\rho_0 \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\frac{1}{Z(\\omega)} \\hat{p}w \\,dS $$\nThe full weak formulation is then:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} (\\nabla \\hat{p} \\cdot \\nabla w - k_w^2 \\hat{p}w) \\,d\\Omega + \\mathrm{i}\\omega\\rho_0 \\int_{\\partial \\Omega_I} \\frac{1}{Z(\\omega)} \\hat{p}w \\,dS = 0 $$\nwhere we have rearranged terms and $\\partial\\Omega_I$ is the part of the boundary with impedance $Z(\\omega)$.

            "problem": "You are tasked with deriving and numerically implementing the finite element formulation for the pressure eigenmodes of a two-dimensional rigid-walled acoustic cavity. The domain is a rectangle with side lengths $L_x$ and $L_y$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$). Assume lossless, inviscid, compressible acoustics governed by the linear acoustic wave equation for pressure $p(\\mathbf{x},t)$, and assume rigid walls (no normal particle velocity at the boundary). Discretize the spatial domain using bilinear quadrilateral elements and employ a standard Galerkin method to obtain the element stiffness, mass, and damping matrices. Use these to assemble global matrices and solve the generalized eigenvalue problem to obtain the lowest few cavity eigenpairs. Compare the numerical wavenumbers against the analytical rigid-walled rectangular cavity modes and quantify discretization error.\n\nDerivation must start from fundamental principles. Begin with the linear acoustic wave equation in pressure for a homogeneous medium with speed of sound $c$ (in $\\mathrm{m/s}$):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} - \\nabla^2 p = 0,\n$$\nin a rectangular domain $\\Omega$ with outward unit normal $\\mathbf{n}$ on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$, and rigid-wall boundary conditions imposing zero normal particle velocity. With time-harmonic ansatz $p(\\mathbf{x},t)=\\Re\\{ \\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x}) e^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t} \\}$, derive the spatial Helmholtz equation, its weak form, and the finite element discretization using bilinear shape functions on a reference square mapped isoparametrically to each element. From the weak form, derive the element stiffness, mass, and damping matrices by integrating appropriate products of shape functions and their gradients over each element. You must not assume or quote any pre-derived finite element matrices; instead, derive them from the weak form and the isoparametric mapping with Jacobian and Gauss quadrature.\n\nAnalytical reference. For a rigid-walled rectangular cavity with Neumann boundary conditions, the analytical eigenfunctions are separable products of cosines, and the wavenumbers satisfy\n$$\nk_{n_x,n_y}^2 = \\left(\\frac{n_x\\pi}{L_x}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{n_y\\pi}{L_y}\\right)^2,\n$$\nfor integers $n_x\\ge 0$, $n_y\\ge 0$. The mode with $n_x=n_y=0$ is the uniform pressure field with $k=0$ and can be ignored when comparing nontrivial modes. The angular frequency is $\\omega=c\\,k$ and the frequency is $f=\\omega/(2\\pi)$, but for this task you must compare wavenumbers $k$ (in $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$).\n\nComputational tasks:\n- Derive the weak form and the finite element matrices. Assemble the global stiffness matrix $K$ and mass matrix $M$ from element contributions. Also derive an element damping matrix $C$ consistent with linear bulk losses modeled as proportional to the pressure rate; however, for eigenpair comparison use zero damping.\n- Solve the generalized symmetric definite eigenvalue problem\n$$\nK \\mathbf{p} = \\lambda M \\mathbf{p},\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda = k^2$ and $k$ is the wavenumber (in $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$). Extract the lowest few positive wavenumbers $k$ by taking square roots of the smallest positive eigenvalues $\\lambda$.\n- Generate the analytical nontrivial wavenumbers $k_{n_x,n_y}$ for the same domain and compare the first few by index with the numerical values.\n- For each test case below, compute the mean absolute relative error across the first $m$ nontrivial modes:\n$$\n\\mathrm{err} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left| \\frac{k_i^{\\mathrm{num}} - k_i^{\\mathrm{anal}}}{k_i^{\\mathrm{anal}}} \\right|,\n$$\nwhich is unitless and must be reported as a decimal.\n\nUse bilinear quadrilateral elements with standard $2\\times 2$ Gauss quadrature in the isoparametric reference square. Your implementation should be general enough to handle any rectangular dimensions and uniform meshes.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$: $L_x=1.0$ $\\mathrm{m}$, $L_y=0.8$ $\\mathrm{m}$, $N_x=2$ elements in $x$, $N_y=2$ elements in $y$, $c=343$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $m=4$ modes.\n- Case $2$: $L_x=1.0$ $\\mathrm{m}$, $L_y=0.8$ $\\mathrm{m}$, $N_x=4$, $N_y=4$, $c=343$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $m=4$ modes.\n- Case $3$: $L_x=1.0$ $\\mathrm{m}$, $L_y=0.8$ $\\mathrm{m}$, $N_x=8$, $N_y=8$, $c=343$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $m=4$ modes.\n- Case $4$: $L_x=1.0$ $\\mathrm{m}$, $L_y=0.8$ $\\mathrm{m}$, $N_x=16$, $N_y=16$, $c=343$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $m=4$ modes.\n\nUnits and output:\n- All lengths must be in $\\mathrm{m}$, the speed of sound in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, and wavenumbers in $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\n- Report the mean absolute relative error as unitless decimals for each test case.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the mean errors of the four test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, $[e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4]$, where each $e_i$ is a decimal.\n\nScientific realism and constraints:\n- Use only the assumptions and derivations outlined, starting from the given fundamental laws. Do not use any shortcut formulas for element matrices.\n- The final comparison must ignore the trivial zero wavenumber mode.\n- Ensure numerical stability by filtering out eigenvalues $\\lambda$ below a small tolerance when taking square roots.\n\nYour final answer must be a complete, runnable program that performs these steps and prints the results in the specified format.",
            "solution": "The user has provided a valid, well-posed problem that requires the derivation and implementation of a two-dimensional finite element method (FEM) to solve for the acoustic eigenmodes of a rigid-walled rectangular cavity. The derivation will commence from the fundamental linear acoustic wave equation, proceed to the Helmholtz equation, and its corresponding weak form. Subsequently, the element stiffness, mass, and damping matrices for an isoparametric bilinear quadrilateral element will be derived. Finally, these elements will form the basis of a numerical program to solve the specified eigenvalue problem and quantify the discretization error against a known analytical solution.\n\nThe governing equation for linear, inviscid, and lossless acoustics is the wave equation for acoustic pressure $p(\\mathbf{x}, t)$, where $\\mathbf{x} = (x, y)$ are the spatial coordinates and $t$ is time:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} - \\nabla^2 p = 0\n$$\nHere, $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium and $\\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator. The domain is a rectangle $\\Omega = [0, L_x] \\times [0, L_y]$. The boundary walls are rigid, which implies zero normal particle velocity. From the linearized Euler's equation, $\\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla p$, this boundary condition translates to a homogeneous Neumann condition on the pressure:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial n} = \\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\partial\\Omega\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing unit normal vector on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$.\n\nTo find the eigenmodes (natural frequencies and mode shapes) of the cavity, we assume a time-harmonic solution of the form $p(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\Re\\{ \\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x}) e^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t} \\}$, where $\\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x})$ is the complex pressure amplitude, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\mathrm{i} = \\sqrt{-1}$. Substituting this ansatz into the wave equation yields the time-independent Helmholtz equation for $\\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x})$ (hereafter, the hat is dropped for notational simplicity):\n$$\n\\nabla^2 p + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} p = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\nabla^2 p + k^2 p = 0\n$$\nwhere $k = \\omega/c$ is the acoustic wavenumber.\n\nTo derive the finite element formulation, we first construct the weak form of the Helmholtz equation. We multiply by a sufficiently smooth test function $w(\\mathbf{x})$ and integrate over the domain $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} w (\\nabla^2 p + k^2 p) \\,d\\Omega = 0\n$$\nApplying integration by parts (Green's first identity) to the Laplacian term gives:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} (-\\nabla w \\cdot \\nabla p + k^2 w p) \\,d\\Omega + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} w (\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\,dS = 0\n$$\nThe boundary integral vanishes due to the rigid-wall boundary condition, $\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0$. This leaves the weak form of the problem: find $p \\in H^1(\\Omega)$ such that for all test functions $w \\in H^1(\\Omega)$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla w \\cdot \\nabla p \\,d\\Omega - k^2 \\int_{\\Omega} w p \\,d\\Omega = 0\n$$\n\nThe next step is to discretize the domain $\\Omega$ into a mesh of non-overlapping finite elements $\\Omega_e$. Within each element, the pressure field $p$ is approximated by a linear combination of nodal values $p_j$ and shape functions $N_j(\\mathbf{x})$:\n$$\np(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx p_h(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\\text{nodes}}} p_j N_j(\\mathbf{x})\n$$\nIn the Galerkin method, the test functions $w$ are chosen from the same basis as the trial functions, i.e., $w = N_i(\\mathbf{x})$ for $i=1, \\dots, N_{\\text{nodes}}$. Substituting these into the weak form, we obtain a system of linear equations for the nodal pressure values $p_j$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\\text{nodes}}} \\left( \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j \\,d\\Omega \\right) p_j - k^2 \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\\text{nodes}}} \\left( \\int_{\\Omega} N_i N_j \\,d\\Omega \\right) p_j = 0\n$$\nThis equation must hold for each basis function $i=1, \\dots, N_{\\text{nodes}}$, leading to the matrix eigenvalue problem:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{p} = k^2 \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{p}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{p}$ is the vector of nodal pressures, and the global stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ and mass matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ have entries:\n$$\nK_{ij} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j \\,d\\Omega \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M_{ij} = \\int_{\\Omega} N_i N_j \\,d\\Omega\n$$\nThese global matrices are assembled by summing contributions from each element:\n$$\nK_{ij} = \\sum_e K_{ij}^e = \\sum_e \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j \\,d\\Omega \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M_{ij} = \\sum_e M_{ij}^e = \\sum_e \\int_{\\Omega_e} N_i N_j \\,d\\Omega\n$$\n\nWe use four-noded isoparametric quadrilateral elements. The geometry and the field variable are interpolated using the same shape functions. We define the element in a canonical reference square domain $\\hat{\\Omega} = [-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]$ with local coordinates $(\\xi, \\eta)$. The bilinear shape functions are:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nN_1(\\xi, \\eta) &= \\frac{1}{4}(1-\\xi)(1-\\eta) \\\\\nN_2(\\xi, \\eta) &= \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\xi)(1-\\eta) \\\\\nN_3(\\xi, \\eta) &= \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\xi)(1+\\eta) \\\\\nN_4(\\xi, \\eta) &= \\frac{1}{4}(1-\\xi)(1+\\eta)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe mapping from reference coordinates $(\\xi, \\eta)$ to physical coordinates $(x, y)$ is given by $\\mathbf{x}(\\xi, \\eta) = \\sum_{a=1}^4 \\mathbf{x}_a N_a(\\xi, \\eta)$, where $\\mathbf{x}_a$ are the physical coordinates of the element's four nodes.\n\nThe derivatives in physical coordinates are related to derivatives in reference coordinates via the Jacobian matrix of the transformation, $\\mathbf{J}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\partial/\\partial\\xi \\\\ \\partial/\\partial\\eta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial x/\\partial\\xi & \\partial y/\\partial\\xi \\\\ \\partial x/\\partial\\eta & \\partial y/\\partial\\eta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial/\\partial x \\\\ \\partial/\\partial y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{J}^T \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial/\\partial x \\\\ \\partial/\\partial y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe standard convention for the Jacobian matrix is $\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial x/\\partial\\xi & \\partial x/\\partial\\eta \\\\ \\partial y/\\partial\\xi & \\partial y/\\partial\\eta \\end{pmatrix}$. Thus $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} N_a = \\mathbf{J}^{-T} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} N_a$. The gradient of a shape function in physical coordinates is $\\nabla N_a = (\\partial N_a/\\partial x, \\partial N_a/\\partial y)^T$.\n\nThe element matrix integrals must be transformed to the reference domain. The differential area element transforms as $d\\Omega = dx\\,dy = \\det(\\mathbf{J}) d\\xi\\,d\\eta$. The element stiffness and mass matrices for an element '$e$' with local node indices $a, b \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ are:\n$$\nK_{ab}^e = \\int_{-1}^1 \\int_{-1}^1 \\left( \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} N_a \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} N_b \\right) \\det(\\mathbf{J}) \\,d\\xi\\,d\\eta\n$$\n$$\nM_{ab}^e = \\int_{-1}^1 \\int_{-1}^1 N_a N_b \\det(\\mathbf{J}) \\,d\\xi\\,d\\eta\n$$\nThese integrals are evaluated numerically using $2 \\times 2$ Gauss quadrature. For a function $f(\\xi, \\eta)$, the integral is approximated as $\\int_{-1}^1 \\int_{-1}^1 f(\\xi, \\eta) \\,d\\xi\\,d\\eta \\approx \\sum_{g=1}^4 w_g f(\\xi_g, \\eta_g)$, where $(\\xi_g, \\eta_g)$ are the Gauss points and $w_g$ are the corresponding weights. For $2 \\times 2$ quadrature, the points are $(\\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}, \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3})$ and all weights are $1$.\n\nA damping matrix is also requested. Modeling linear bulk losses proportional to the pressure rate adds a term $\\beta \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}$ to the wave equation.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} + \\beta \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} - \\nabla^2 p = 0\n$$\nApplying the harmonic ansatz gives $\\left(-\\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} + \\mathrm{i}\\omega\\beta \\right) p - \\nabla^2 p = 0$. The weak form gains a term $\\int_\\Omega \\mathrm{i}\\omega\\beta w p \\,d\\Omega$. In an undamped context, this would discretize into a time-domain matrix equation $\\frac{1}{c^2}\\mathbf{M} \\ddot{\\mathbf{p}} + \\mathbf{C} \\dot{\\mathbf{p}} + \\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{0}$, where the element damping matrix $\\mathbf{C}^e$ is given by:\n$$\nC_{ab}^e = \\int_{\\Omega_e} c^2 \\beta N_a N_b \\, d\\Omega = c^2 \\beta \\int_{-1}^1 \\int_{-1}^1 N_a N_b \\det(\\mathbf{J}) \\,d\\xi\\,d\\eta = c^2 \\beta M_{ab}^e\n$$\nSo, the damping matrix is proportional to the mass matrix. For the eigenvalue analysis, damping is ignored ($\\beta=0$).\n\nThe final procedure is to assemble the global matrices $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{M}$ from their element-wise counterparts, solve the generalized eigenvalue problem $\\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{p} = \\lambda \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{p}$ for the eigenvalues $\\lambda_i = k_i^2$, and then compute the wavenumbers $k_i = \\sqrt{\\lambda_i}$. The computed numerical wavenumbers are compared to the analytical values for a rectangular cavity, $k_{n_x, n_y} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{n_x\\pi}{L_x})^2 + (\\frac{n_y\\pi}{L_y})^2}$, to quantify the error. The trivial mode with $k=0$ ($n_x=n_y=0$) is ignored in this comparison.",
