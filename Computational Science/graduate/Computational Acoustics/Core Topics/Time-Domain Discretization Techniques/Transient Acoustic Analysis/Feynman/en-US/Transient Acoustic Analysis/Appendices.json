            "problem": "You are tasked with designing and implementing a numerical experiment to empirically determine and compare convergence rates in time and space for a transient solver applied to one-dimensional linear acoustics. The governing first-order system is derived from conservation of mass and momentum for small perturbations in a compressible medium and is given by the coupled system\n$$\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} + K \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0,$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = 0,$$\nwhere $p$ is acoustic pressure in $\\mathrm{Pa}$, $u$ is particle velocity in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $K$ is bulk modulus in $\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\rho$ is mass density in $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, and $x$ denotes one spatial dimension in $\\mathrm{m}$. The wave speed is $c = \\sqrt{K/\\rho}$ in $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nConsider the spatial domain $x \\in [0, L]$ with $L = 1$ $\\mathrm{m}$ and periodic boundary conditions. Use the initial condition\n$$p(x,0) = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\ \\mathrm{Pa}, \\quad u(x,0) = 0 \\ \\mathrm{m/s},$$\nwith angles understood to be in radians. For these data, the exact solution to the above system at time $t$ is\n$$p_{\\text{exact}}(x,t) = \\sin(2\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi c t),$$\n$$u_{\\text{exact}}(x,t) = -\\frac{c}{K}\\cos(2\\pi x)\\sin(2\\pi c t).$$\n\nYou must implement a second-order accurate explicit transient solver that uses central differences in space and a leapfrog-in-time staggering to integrate the first-order system above under periodic boundary conditions. Let the spatial grid have $N_x$ points, with uniform spacing $\\Delta x = L/N_x$. Use a central difference approximation for spatial derivatives and stagger the time integration such that $u$ is advanced at half time levels and $p$ is advanced at integer time levels. Ensure that the time step $\\Delta t$ satisfies a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability restriction consistent with an explicit second-order central scheme for advection-like hyperbolic systems, and quantify empirical accuracy rather than relying on any stability shortcut formula in the design; the solver must only rely on foundational definitions and widely accepted numerical discretization principles.\n\nFor each run, compute the solution for acoustic pressure $p(x,t)$ up to a prescribed final time $T$, and evaluate the discrete $L^2$-norm error against the exact solution,\n$$E = \\left( \\Delta x \\sum_{i=0}^{N_x-1} \\left[p_i(T) - p_{\\text{exact}}(x_i,T)\\right]^2 \\right)^{1/2},$$\nwhere $x_i = i \\Delta x$ and $p_i(T)$ denotes the numerical pressure at node $i$ at time $T$. The Empirical Order of Convergence (EOC) between two runs with characteristic step sizes $h_1$ and $h_2$ and corresponding errors $E_1$ and $E_2$ is computed as\n$$\\mathrm{EOC} = \\frac{\\log(E_1/E_2)}{\\log(h_1/h_2)}.$$\nWhen refining in time, take $h = \\Delta t$. When refining in space, take $h = \\Delta x$.\n\nYour program must compute empirical convergence rates for both time refinement and space refinement using systematic refinements and compare the observed orders with the theoretically predicted order $2$. Use the following physical parameters: $\\rho = 1.2$ $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $K = 142000$ $\\mathrm{Pa}$, implying $c = \\sqrt{K/\\rho}$ in $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nImplement four test cases to ensure coverage:\n- Test case $1$ (time refinement, happy path): $N_x = 1024$, $\\Delta t \\in \\{1.5\\times 10^{-6}, 7.5\\times 10^{-7}, 3.75\\times 10^{-7}\\}$ $\\mathrm{s}$, and $T = 3.0\\times 10^{-5}$ $\\mathrm{s}$. Compute the errors and EOC values for successive refinements in $\\Delta t$, then report the average EOC over the two successive pairs, and a boolean indicating whether the average EOC is within $\\pm 0.2$ of the theoretical order $2$.\n- Test case $2$ (time refinement near stability boundary): $N_x = 256$, set $\\Delta t$ as $\\{0.98, 0.49, 0.245\\}\\times \\Delta x / c$ in $\\mathrm{s}$, and $T = 3.0\\times 10^{-4}$ $\\mathrm{s}$. Compute the errors, successive EOCs, the average EOC, and a boolean pass/fail with the same $\\pm 0.2$ tolerance around $2$.\n- Test case $3$ (space refinement, happy path): $N_x \\in \\{64, 128, 256\\}$, with $\\Delta t$ chosen as $\\Delta t = \\sigma \\Delta x^2 / c$ in $\\mathrm{s}$ using $\\sigma = 0.3$ (dimensionless), and $T = 2.0\\times 10^{-5}$ $\\mathrm{s}$. Compute errors, successive EOCs with $h=\\Delta x$, the average EOC, and a boolean pass/fail with the same $\\pm 0.2$ tolerance around $2$.\n- Test case $4$ (space refinement, coarse-grid boundary): $N_x \\in \\{16, 32, 64\\}$, with $\\Delta t = \\sigma \\Delta x^2 / c$ as in test case $3$ and $T = 2.0\\times 10^{-5}$ $\\mathrm{s}$. Compute errors, successive EOCs with $h=\\Delta x$, the average EOC, and a boolean pass/fail with the same $\\pm 0.2$ tolerance around $2$.\n\nAll angles in trigonometric functions must be interpreted in radians. Time values must be in $\\mathrm{s}$ and lengths in $\\mathrm{m}$ as specified above. The quantities you output (EOC values and booleans) are dimensionless. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, specifically\n$$[\\text{EOC}_1, \\text{pass}_1, \\text{EOC}_2, \\text{pass}_2, \\text{EOC}_3, \\text{pass}_3, \\text{EOC}_4, \\text{pass}_4],$$\nwhere $\\text{EOC}_k$ is the average empirical order of convergence for test case $k$ and $\\text{pass}_k$ is a boolean indicating whether the average EOC for test case $k$ lies within the tolerance interval $[2-0.2, 2+0.2]$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded task in computational acoustics that is complete, consistent, and requires a non-trivial numerical solution and analysis. All provided data, equations, and conditions are standard and verifiable.\n\nThe solution involves implementing a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) solver for the one-dimensional linear acoustic equations and conducting an empirical convergence study. The methodology is detailed below in a step-by-step manner.\n\n**1. Governing Equations and Discretization**\n\nThe problem is governed by the first-order linear system for acoustics:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} + K \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\nwhere $p$ is the acoustic pressure, $u$ is the particle velocity, $K$ is the bulk modulus, and $\\rho$ is the mass density. The spatial domain is $x \\in [0, L]$ with $L=1$ m, and we impose periodic boundary conditions.\n\nWe discretize the spatial domain into $N_x$ points $x_i = i \\Delta x$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N_x-1$, where $\\Delta x = L/N_x$. Time is discretized in steps of $\\Delta t$. A staggered leapfrog scheme is employed, where pressure $p_i^n$ is evaluated at integer time steps $t^n = n \\Delta t$, and velocity $u_i^{n+1/2}$ is evaluated at half-integer time steps $t^{n+1/2} = (n+1/2) \\Delta t$.\n\nThe spatial derivatives are approximated using a second-order accurate central difference stencil:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_i} \\approx \\frac{f_{i+1} - f_{i-1}}{2 \\Delta x} $$\nThe time derivatives are approximated using a second-order central difference (leapfrog) approach:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\\bigg|_{(x_i, t^{n+1/2})} \\approx \\frac{p_i^{n+1} - p_i^n}{\\Delta t} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\bigg|_{(x_i, t^{n})} \\approx \\frac{u_i^{n+1/2} - u_i^{n-1/2}}{\\Delta t} $$\n\n**2. Numerical Scheme: Staggered Leapfrog (FDTD)**\n\nSubstituting the discrete approximations into the governing equations yields the explicit update rules. The equation for $\\partial p / \\partial t$ is centered at time $t^{n+1/2}$ and the equation for $\\partial u / \\partial t$ is centered at time $t^n$. This is a slight notational mismatch from the standard Yee-staggered grid, but the resulting numerical scheme is identical and correct. A more consistent centering would be:\n$$ \\frac{p_i^{n+1} - p_i^n}{\\Delta t} = -K \\frac{u_{i+1}^{n+1/2} - u_{i-1}^{n+1/2}}{2 \\Delta x} $$\n$$ \\frac{u_i^{n+1/2} - u_i^{n-1/2}}{\\Delta t} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{p_{i+1}^n - p_{i-1}^n}{2 \\Delta x} $$\nRearranging these gives the explicit update equations for the solver:\n1. Update for velocity $u$:\n$$ u_i^{n+1/2} = u_i^{n-1/2} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho (2 \\Delta x)} (p_{i+1}^n - p_{i-1}^n) $$\n2. Update for pressure $p$:\n$$ p_i^{n+1} = p_i^n - K \\frac{\\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x} (u_{i+1}^{n+1/2} - u_{i-1}^{n+1/2}) $$\nThis scheme is second-order accurate in both time and space, $O(\\Delta t^2, \\Delta x^2)$.\n\n**3. Scheme Initialization**\n\nThe simulation starts at $t=0$ with given initial conditions $p(x,0)$ and $u(x,0)$. We set $p_i^0 = \\sin(2\\pi x_i)$ and $u_i^0 = 0$. The leapfrog scheme requires $u$ at a half-time step to begin. To find $u_i^{1/2}$, we perform a single forward Euler half-step update for $u$ from $t=0$ to $t=\\Delta t/2$:\n$$ u_i^{1/2} = u_i^0 - \\frac{\\Delta t/2}{\\rho} \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\right)_i^0 \\approx u_i^0 - \\frac{\\Delta t/2}{\\rho} \\frac{p_{i+1}^0 - p_{i-1}^0}{2\\Delta x} $$\nSince $u_i^0=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ u_i^{1/2} = - \\frac{\\Delta t}{4 \\rho \\Delta x} (p_{i+1}^0 - p_{i-1}^0) $$\nThis \"kick-start\" step has a local truncation error of $O(\\Delta t^2)$, which is consistent with the global second-order accuracy of the main leapfrog algorithm and does not degrade the overall convergence rate.\n\n**4. Boundary Conditions**\n\nPeriodic boundary conditions, $f(0,t) = f(L,t)$, are implemented by ensuring that for a grid point $i$, the neighbor at $i-1$ for $i=0$ is $N_x-1$, and the neighbor at $i+1$ for $i=N_x-1$ is $0$. In the vector-based implementation, this is efficiently handled using `numpy.roll` to perform circular shifts on the arrays representing the fields $p$ and $u$.\n\n**5. Error Analysis and Empirical Order of Convergence (EOC)**\n\nThe numerical solution is run until a final time $T_{final}$. The final time is determined by $T_{final} = N_t \\Delta t$, where $N_t = \\lceil T/\\Delta t \\rceil$ to ensure the simulation time is at least the target time $T$. The accuracy of the numerical pressure $p_i(T_{final})$ is measured against the exact solution $p_{\\text{exact}}(x_i, T_{final})$ using the discrete $L^2$-norm:\n$$ E = \\left( \\Delta x \\sum_{i=0}^{N_x-1} \\left[p_i(T_{final}) - p_{\\text{exact}}(x_i, T_{final})\\right]^2 \\right)^{1/2} $$\nThe Empirical Order of Convergence (EOC) is computed from two runs with characteristic step sizes $h_1$ and $h_2$ (where $h$ can be $\\Delta t$ or $\\Delta x$) and corresponding errors $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n$$ \\mathrm{EOC} = \\frac{\\log(E_1/E_2)}{\\log(h_1/h_2)} $$\nFor refinements where $h_2=h_1/2$, this simplifies to $\\mathrm{EOC} = \\log_2(E_1/E_2)$.\n\n**6. Convergence Study Design**\n\nThe four test cases are designed to validate the theoretical second-order convergence of the scheme in both time and space.\n- **Time Refinement (Cases 1 & 2)**: The spatial resolution $N_x$ is held constant while the time step $\\Delta t$ is systematically refined. The error is expected to be dominated by the temporal discretization, and the EOC with respect to $\\Delta t$ should be approximately $2$. Case $1$ uses a fine spatial grid and small Courant numbers, representing an ideal scenario. Case $2$ probes behavior near the stability limit (Courant number $\\approx 1$).\n- **Space Refinement (Cases 3 & 4)**: The spatial resolution $N_x$ is refined, and the time step $\\Delta t$ is coupled to the spatial step via $\\Delta t = \\sigma \\Delta x^2 / c$. The total error is of the form $O(\\Delta t^2, \\Delta x^2) = O((\\Delta x^2)^2, \\Delta x^2) = O(\\Delta x^4, \\Delta x^2)$. As $\\Delta x$ decreases, the $O(\\Delta x^2)$ term dominates. This design effectively isolates the spatial convergence rate, which is expected to be approximately $2$. Case $3$ uses relatively fine grids, while Case $4$ uses coarse grids where pre-asymptotic effects might reduce the observed EOC.",

We now compute the RK4 stages:\n\n$k_1 = \\Delta t \\, (i\\,\\omega\\,q_n) = (i\\,\\omega\\,\\Delta t) q_n = z\\,q_n$\n$k_2 = \\Delta t \\, (i\\,\\omega\\,(q_n + \\frac{1}{2}k_1)) = z (q_n + \\frac{1}{2}z\\,q_n) = z\\,q_n(1 + \\frac{z}{2})$\n$k_3 = \\Delta t \\, (i\\,\\omega\\,(q_n + \\frac{1}{2}k_2)) = z (q_n + \\frac{1}{2}z\\,q_n(1 + \\frac{z}{2})) = z\\,q_n(1 + \\frac{z}{2} + \\frac{z^2}{4})$\n$k_4 = \\Delta t \\, (i\\,\\omega\\,(q_n + k_3)) = z (q_n + z\\,q_n(1 + \\frac{z}{2} + \\frac{z^2}{4})) = z\\,q_n(1 + z + \\frac{z^2}{2} + \\frac{z^3}{4})$\n\nNow, we substitute these into the update formula for $q_{n+1}$:\n$$q_{n+1} = q_n + \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ zq_n + 2zq_n(1+\\frac{z}{2}) + 2zq_n(1+\\frac{z}{2}+\\frac{z^2}{4}) + zq_n(1+z+\\frac{z^2}{2}+\\frac{z^3}{4}) \\right]$$\nThe amplification factor $G(z) = q_{n+1}/q_n$ is:\n$$G(z) = 1 + \\frac{z}{6} \\left[ 1 + 2(1+\\frac{z}{2}) + 2(1+\\frac{z}{2}+\\frac{z^2}{4}) + (1+z+\\frac{z^2}{2}+\\frac{z^3}{4}) \\right]$$\nCombining terms of the same power of $z$ inside the brackets:\n- Constant term: $1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6$\n- $z$ term: $2(\\frac{1}{2}) + 2(\\frac{1}{2}) + 1 = 3$\n- $z^2$ term: $2(\\frac{1}{4}) + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$\n- $z^3$ term: $\\frac{1}{4}$\nSo the term in brackets is $6 + 3z + z^2 + \\frac{z^3}{4}$.\n$$G(z) = 1 + \\frac{z}{6} \\left( 6 + 3z + z^2 + \\frac{z^3}{4} \\right) = 1 + z + \\frac{z^2}{2} + \\frac{z^3}{6} + \\frac{z^4}{24}$$\nThis is the Taylor series expansion of $\\exp(z)$ up to the $z^4$ term. Substituting $z = i\\theta$:\n$$G(\\theta) = 1 + (i\\theta) + \\frac{(i\\theta)^2}{2!} + \\frac{(i\\theta)^3}{3!} + \\frac{(i\\theta)^4}{4!}$$\n$$G(\\theta) = 1 + i\\theta - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2} - i\\frac{\\theta^3}{6} + \\frac{\\theta^4}{24}$$\nGrouping real and imaginary parts:\n$$G(\\theta) = \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2} + \\frac{\\theta^4}{24} \\right) + i \\left( \\theta - \\frac{\\theta^3}{6} \\right)$$\n\nThe exact solution to $\\frac{dq}{dt} = i\\,\\omega\\,q$ after one time step is $q(t_n+\\Delta t) = q(t_n) \\exp(i\\,\\omega\\,\\Delta t) = q(t_n)\\exp(i\\theta)$. Thus, the exact amplification factor is $G_{exact}(\\theta) = \\exp(i\\theta)$. The RK4 amplification factor $G(\\theta)$ is a fourth-order approximation to $G_{exact}(\\theta)$. The error is $G(\\theta) - G_{exact}(\\theta) = -\\frac{(i\\theta)^5}{5!} - \\frac{(i\\theta)^6}{6!} - \\dots$. Let this error be $E(\\theta) = -\\frac{i\\theta^5}{120} + \\frac{\\theta^6}{720} + O(\\theta^7)$.\n\n**Numerical Dissipation, $D(\\theta)$**\nWe need to find the leading-order term of $D(\\theta) = |G(\\theta)| - 1$. We calculate $|G(\\theta)|^2$:\n$$|G(\\theta)|^2 = \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2} + \\frac{\\theta^4}{24} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\theta - \\frac{\\theta^3}{6} \\right)^2$$\nExpanding and keeping terms up to $\\theta^6$:\n$$ \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2} + \\frac{\\theta^4}{24} \\right)^2 = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}\\right)\\frac{\\theta^4}{24} + \\dots = 1 - \\theta^2 + \\frac{\\theta^4}{4} + \\frac{\\theta^4}{12} - \\frac{\\theta^6}{24} + \\dots = 1 - \\theta^2 + \\frac{\\theta^4}{3} - \\frac{\\theta^6}{24} + O(\\theta^8) $$\n$$ \\left( \\theta - \\frac{\\theta^3}{6} \\right)^2 = \\theta^2 - 2\\theta\\frac{\\theta^3}{6} + \\left(\\frac{\\theta^3}{6}\\right)^2 = \\theta^2 - \\frac{\\theta^4}{3} + \\frac{\\theta^6}{36} $$\nSumming these gives:\n$$|G(\\theta)|^2 = \\left(1 - \\theta^2 + \\frac{\\theta^4}{3} - \\frac{\\theta^6}{24}\\right) + \\left(\\theta^2 - \\frac{\\theta^4}{3} + \\frac{\\theta^6}{36}\\right) + O(\\theta^8) = 1 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{24} + \\frac{1}{36}\\right)\\theta^6 + O(\\theta^8) = 1 - \\frac{\\theta^6}{72} + O(\\theta^8)$$\nNow we find $|G(\\theta)|$ using the binomial approximation $\\sqrt{1+x} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x$:\n$$|G(\\theta)| = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{\\theta^6}{72} + O(\\theta^8)} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\theta^6}{72} + O(\\theta^8) = 1 - \\frac{\\theta^6}{144} + O(\\theta^8)$$\nThe numerical dissipation is:\n$$D(\\theta) = |G(\\theta)| - 1 = -\\frac{\\theta^6}{144} + O(\\theta^8)$$\n\n**Numerical Dispersion, $\\Phi(\\theta)$**\nWe need to find the leading-order term of $\\Phi(\\theta) = \\arg(G(\\theta)) - \\theta$. Let $\\phi_G = \\arg(G(\\theta))$.\nWe can write $G(\\theta) = G_{exact}(\\theta) + E(\\theta) = \\exp(i\\theta) + E(\\theta) = \\exp(i\\theta) \\left(1 + \\exp(-i\\theta)E(\\theta)\\right)$.\nTaking the argument of both sides:\n$$\\phi_G = \\arg(\\exp(i\\theta)) + \\arg\\left(1 + \\exp(-i\\theta)E(\\theta)\\right) = \\theta + \\arg\\left(1 + \\exp(-i\\theta)E(\\theta)\\right)$$\nSo, $\\Phi(\\theta) = \\arg\\left(1 + \\exp(-i\\theta)E(\\theta)\\right)$. For a small complex number $w$, $\\arg(1+w) \\approx \\text{Im}(w)$. Let's find $w = \\exp(-i\\theta)E(\\theta)$:\n$$w = \\left(1 - i\\theta + O(\\theta^2)\\right) \\left(-\\frac{i\\theta^5}{120} + \\frac{\\theta^6}{720} + O(\\theta^7)\\right)$$\n$$w = -\\frac{i\\theta^5}{120} + (-i\\theta)(-\\frac{i\\theta^5}{120}) + \\frac{\\theta^6}{720} + O(\\theta^7) = -\\frac{i\\theta^5}{120} - \\frac{\\theta^6}{120} + \\frac{\\theta^6}{720} + O(\\theta^7) = -\\frac{i\\theta^5}{120} - \\frac{5\\theta^6}{720} + O(\\theta^7)$$\nThe imaginary part is $\\text{Im}(w) = -\\frac{\\theta^5}{120} + O(\\theta^7)$.\nTherefore, the numerical dispersion is:\n$$\\Phi(\\theta) = \\arg(1+w) \\approx \\text{Im}(w) = -\\frac{\\theta^5}{120} + O(\\theta^7)$$\n\n**Physical Interpretation**\n- **Numerical Dissipation ($D(\\theta) \\approx -\\frac{\\theta^6}{144}$):** This term measures the error in the wave's amplitude. Since $D(\\theta)$ is negative, the numerical scheme spuriously removes energy from the system, causing the amplitude of the wave to decay over time. The exact solution for this lossless medium should have constant amplitude ($D=0$). The error is of order $\\theta^6$, which is very small for low frequencies or small time steps (small $\\theta$). This indicates that the RK4 method is very effective at preserving wave amplitude.\n- **Numerical Dispersion ($\\Phi(\\theta) \\approx -\\frac{\\theta^5}{120}$):** This term measures the error in the wave's phase per time step. For the exact solution, the phase advances by $\\theta$. The numerical phase advance is $\\phi_G = \\theta + \\Phi(\\theta)$. Since $\\Phi(\\theta)$ is negative, the numerical wave travels with a phase speed $c_{num} = c(1 + \\Phi(\\theta)/\\theta) \\approx c(1 - \\theta^4/120)$, which is less than the true speed $c$. This is a \"lagging\" phase error. More importantly, the error depends on frequency ($\\theta \\propto \\omega$). A broadband pulse, composed of many frequencies, will have its different frequency components travel at different speeds, causing the pulse to spread out and distort its shape over time. This phenomenon is called numerical dispersion. For RK4, the phase error ($O(\\theta^5)$) is the dominant source of inaccuracy compared to the amplitude error ($O(\\theta^6)$) for well-resolved waves (small $\\theta$).",

            "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional linearized acoustic wave equation for pressure, derived from the linearized momentum and continuity equations under small perturbations in a homogeneous medium of constant density and sound speed, given by $p_{tt} - c^{2} p_{xx} = 0$, where $p(x,t)$ is pressure, $c$ is the sound speed, and subscripts denote partial derivatives. In computational acoustics, high-frequency spurious transients can arise from numerical dispersion and aliasing when discretizing this equation on a grid. A common stabilization is to add an artificial viscosity term $\\nu\\, p_{xxt}$ to the right-hand side, yielding $p_{tt} - c^{2} p_{xx} = \\nu\\, p_{xxt}$, where $\\nu$ is a positive coefficient with dimensions of $\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Alternatively, explicit filtering in Fourier space attenuates high-wavenumber components per time step. Both approaches aim to suppress spurious high-frequency content while minimally disturbing the physical frequency band of interest.\n\nStarting from first principles of the wave dynamics and modal (Fourier) analysis, explain the mechanism by which high-wavenumber modes are selectively damped by artificial viscosity or filtering. Then, derive a criterion that ensures the relative amplitude attenuation at time $T$ across the physical band of interest is bounded below by a specified threshold, while the spurious band is attenuated below a specified level. Concretely, let the physical band be defined by wavenumbers $|k| \\leq k_{p}$, where $k_{p} = 2\\pi f_{p}/c$ for a maximum physical frequency $f_{p}$, and let the spurious band be characterized by $|k| \\geq k_{s}$, where $k_{s}$ can be approximated by the numerical Nyquist wavenumber $k_{s} = \\pi/\\Delta x$ on a uniform grid of spacing $\\Delta x$. Let the acceptable relative amplitude loss (after time $T$) for the physical band be no more than $\\varepsilon$ (so amplitudes must remain at least $1 - \\varepsilon$ of their initial values), and the required attenuation factor for the spurious band be at most $r$ (so amplitudes must be reduced to $r$ or less of their initial values).\n\nFor the following scientifically realistic parameters, compute the minimal artificial viscosity coefficient $\\nu$ that satisfies both constraints at time $T$:\n- Sound speed $c = 1500\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$,\n- Grid spacing $\\Delta x = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{m}$,\n- Maximum physical frequency $f_{p} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$,\n- Time horizon $T = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{s}$,\n- Physical-band tolerance $\\varepsilon = 0.010$,\n- Spurious-band attenuation target $r = 0.600$.\n\nExpress the final $\\nu$ in $\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and round your answer to four significant figures. Your derivation should start from the governing equations and use modal analysis to obtain the wavenumber-dependent attenuation, from which you formulate the criterion linking $\\nu$, $k_{p}$, $k_{s}$, $\\varepsilon$, $r$, and $T$, and then compute the required value for $\\nu$ under the given parameters.

The analysis via Fourier modes is the correct and standard approach to study the dispersive and dissipative properties of such an equation.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides two inequality constraints on a single parameter, $\\nu$, and asks for the minimum value that satisfies them. This is a well-defined optimization problem. All necessary data are provided.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains a complete and consistent set of data and constraints. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe governing equation is the one-dimensional acoustic wave equation modified with an artificial viscosity term:\n$$p_{tt} - c^{2} p_{xx} = \\nu p_{xxt}$$\nTo analyze the behavior of different frequency components, we perform a modal analysis. We seek a plane-wave solution of the form:\n$$p(x,t) = \\hat{p}(k) \\exp(i(kx - \\omega t))$$\nwhere $k$ is the real-valued wavenumber and $\\omega$ is the potentially complex-valued angular frequency. The imaginary part of $\\omega$ will describe the temporal amplitude decay or growth.\n\nWe compute the partial derivatives of this solution form:\n- $p_{tt} = (-i\\omega)^{2} p = -\\omega^{2} p$\n- $p_{xx} = (ik)^{2} p = -k^{2} p$\n- $p_{xxt} = (ik)^{2}(-i\\omega) p = i\\omega k^{2} p$\n\nSubstituting these into the governing equation yields the characteristic equation, also known as the dispersion relation:\n$$-\\omega^{2} p - c^{2}(-k^{2} p) = \\nu (i\\omega k^{2} p)$$\nDividing by $p$ (which is non-zero for a non-trivial solution), we get:\n$$-\\omega^{2} + c^{2} k^{2} = i\\nu\\omega k^{2}$$\nThis can be rearranged into a quadratic equation for $\\omega$:\n$$\\omega^{2} + (i\\nu k^{2})\\omega - c^{2} k^{2} = 0$$\nWe solve for $\\omega$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$\\omega = \\frac{-i\\nu k^{2} \\pm \\sqrt{(i\\nu k^{2})^{2} - 4(1)(-c^{2} k^{2})}}{2} = \\frac{-i\\nu k^{2} \\pm \\sqrt{-\\nu^{2} k^{4} + 4c^{2} k^{2}}}{2}$$\n$$\\omega = \\frac{-i\\nu k^{2} \\pm |k|\\sqrt{4c^{2} - \\nu^{2} k^{2}}}{2}$$\nWe can separate $\\omega$ into its real and imaginary parts, $\\omega = \\omega_{R} + i\\omega_{I}$.\n$$\\omega_{R} = \\pm \\frac{|k|}{2}\\sqrt{4c^{2} - \\nu^{2} k^{2}}$$\n$$\\omega_{I} = -\\frac{\\nu k^{2}}{2}$$\nThe solution for a given mode $k$ is $p_k(x,t) = \\hat{p}(k) \\exp(i(kx - \\omega_R t)) \\exp(\\omega_I t)$. The amplitude of this mode evolves in time as $A(t) = A(0) \\exp(\\omega_I t) = A(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\nu k^{2}}{2} t\\right)$.\n\n**Mechanism of Selective Damping:**\nThe damping is governed by the term $\\exp(-\\frac{\\nu k^{2}}{2} t)$. Since $\\nu > 0$, the amplitude of every mode decreases over time. The crucial observation is that the decay rate, given by the exponent $-\\frac{\\nu k^{2} t}{2}$, is proportional to $k^{2}$. This means that modes with high wavenumbers (large $|k|$), which correspond to high spatial frequencies and often arise as spurious numerical artifacts, are damped much more aggressively than modes with low wavenumbers (small $|k|$), which represent the physical, large-scale features of the wave. This is the mechanism by which artificial viscosity selectively suppresses high-frequency numerical noise.\n\n**Derivation of the Criterion for $\\nu$:**\nThe relative amplitude of a mode with wavenumber $k$ after a time $T$ is:\n$$A_{rel}(k, T) = \\frac{A(T)}{A(0)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\nu k^{2} T}{2}\\right)$$\n\n**Constraint 1: Physical Band ($|k| \\leq k_{p}$)**\nThe amplitude loss must not exceed $\\varepsilon$, so the relative amplitude must be at least $1-\\varepsilon$. The damping is strongest at the upper edge of this band, $|k|=k_{p}$. To satisfy the constraint for the entire band, we must satisfy it at this worst-case point:\n$$A_{rel}(k_p, T) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\nu k_{p}^{2} T}{2}\\right) \\geq 1 - \\varepsilon$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{\\nu k_{p}^{2} T}{2} \\geq \\ln(1 - \\varepsilon)$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality:\n$$\\frac{\\nu k_{p}^{2} T}{2} \\leq -\\ln(1 - \\varepsilon) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - \\varepsilon}\\right)$$\nThis gives an upper bound on $\\nu$:\n$$\\nu \\leq \\frac{2}{k_{p}^{2} T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - \\varepsilon}\\right)$$\n\n**Constraint 2: Spurious Band ($|k| \\geq k_{s}$)**\nThe amplitude must be attenuated to at most a factor of $r$. Damping is weakest at the lower edge of this band, $|k|=k_{s}$. To ensure all spurious modes are sufficiently attenuated, we must satisfy the constraint at this least-damped point:\n$$A_{rel}(k_s, T) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\nu k_{s}^{2} T}{2}\\right) \\leq r$$\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$-\\frac{\\nu k_{s}^{2} T}{2} \\leq \\ln(r)$$\n$$\\frac{\\nu k_{s}^{2} T}{2} \\geq -\\ln(r) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)$$\nThis gives a lower bound on $\\nu$:\n$$\\nu \\geq \\frac{2}{k_{s}^{2} T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)$$\n\n**Computation of Minimal $\\nu$:**\nWe require a value of $\\nu$ that satisfies both derived inequalities. To find the minimal such $\\nu$, we must choose the smallest possible value that satisfies the second constraint, which is the lower bound itself. This choice is valid if it does not violate the first constraint.\nThe minimal viscosity coefficient is therefore:\n$$\\nu_{min} = \\frac{2}{k_{s}^{2} T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical parameters.\nFirst, calculate the wavenumbers $k_{p}$ and $k_{s}$:\n$$k_{p} = \\frac{2\\pi f_{p}}{c} = \\frac{2\\pi (1000)}{1500} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\,\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\n$$k_{s} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\pi}{0.1} = 10\\pi\\,\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, compute $\\nu_{min}$ using $k_{s} = 10\\pi$, $T = 0.020$, and $r = 0.600$:\n$$\\nu_{min} = \\frac{2}{(10\\pi)^{2} (0.020)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.600}\\right) = \\frac{2}{100\\pi^{2} (0.020)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\pi^{2}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)$$\nNumerically:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right) \\approx 0.51082562376$$\n$$\\pi^{2} \\approx 9.8696044011$$\n$$\\nu_{min} \\approx \\frac{0.51082562}{9.8696044} \\approx 0.05175743\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nWe must verify that this minimal $\\nu$ also satisfies the physical band constraint:\n$\\nu \\leq \\frac{2}{k_{p}^{2} T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - \\varepsilon}\\right)$.
