Their magnitude is $|\\lambda_{\\pm}| = \\sqrt{A^{2} + (1-A^{2})} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. The scheme is neutrally stable for these modes.\n-   If the discriminant $A^{2}-1 > 0$, which means $|A| > 1$, the roots are real. Since their product is $\\lambda_{+}\\lambda_{-} = 1$, one root must have a magnitude greater than $1$, and the other less than $1$. This indicates instability.\n\nThe condition for stability is therefore $|A| \\le 1$, which translates to:\n$$\n-1 \\le 1 - 2\\sigma^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\le 1\n$$\nThe right side of the inequality, $1 - 2\\sigma^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\le 1$, simplifies to $-2\\sigma^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\le 0$, which is always true.\nThe left side, $-1 \\le 1 - 2\\sigma^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\theta}{2})$, gives $2\\sigma^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\le 2$, or $\\sigma^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\le 1$.\nSince $\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\theta}{2})$ has a maximum value of $1$ (for the Nyquist mode $\\theta = \\pi$), the condition must hold for this worst case, leading to the famous Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability condition:\n$$\n\\sigma \\le 1\n$$\n\n**4. Analysis of the Unstable Case**\n\nThe problem provides a numerical example with $\\sigma = 1.05$. Since $\\sigma > 1$, the scheme is expected to be unstable for some modes. The most critical mode is the Nyquist mode, $\\theta = \\pi$.\n\nAnalytically, we check if the stability condition $\\sigma^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\le 1$ is satisfied.\nFor $\\sigma = 1.05$ and $\\theta = \\pi$:\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = (1.05)^{2} \\times 1^{2} = 1.1025\n$$\nSince $1.1025 > 1$, the stability condition is violated. This demonstrates analytically that the scheme is unstable for this Courant number and spatial mode.\nFor this case, the quantity $A$ is:\n$$\nA = 1 - 2\\sigma^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 1 - 2(1.1025) = 1 - 2.205 = -1.205\n$$\nSince $A = -1.205 < -1$, we are in the unstable regime where the roots are real. The unstable root is the one with magnitude greater than $1$. The roots are $\\lambda_{\\pm} = A \\pm \\sqrt{A^{2}-1}$. Since $A < 0$, both roots are negative. The root $\\lambda_{-} = A - \\sqrt{A^{2}-1}$ will have the larger magnitude.\n$|\\lambda_{-}| = -(A - \\sqrt{A^{2}-1}) = -A + \\sqrt{A^{2}-1}$. Since $A < -1$, $-A > 1$, so $|\\lambda_{-}| > 1$.\n\n**5. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe now calculate the magnitude of the unstable root for $A = -1.205$. The unstable root's magnitude is:\n$$\n|\\lambda_{\\text{unstable}}| = -A + \\sqrt{A^{2}-1} = -(-1.205) + \\sqrt{(-1.205)^{2} - 1}\n$$\n$$\n|\\lambda_{\\text{unstable}}| = 1.205 + \\sqrt{1.452025 - 1}\n$$\n$$\n|\\lambda_{\\text{unstable}}| = 1.205 + \\sqrt{0.452025}\n$$\n$$\n|\\lambda_{\\text{unstable}}| = 1.205 + 0.67232805...\n$$\n$$\n|\\lambda_{\\text{unstable}}| = 1.87732805...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $1.877$.\nThis confirms that for a Courant number just $5\\%$ above the stability limit, the highest frequency mode on the grid grows by approximately $88\\%$ at every time step, leading to rapid numerical instability.",
