            "problem": "A High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) transducer produces a continuous-wave, axisymmetric cylindrical beam with approximately uniform time-averaged intensity $I$ across a radius $a$ in a tissue-mimicking fluid. The fluid is modeled as an incompressible, Newtonian medium with density $\\rho$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, and it exhibits absorption of ultrasound characterized by an attenuation coefficient $\\alpha$ (in nepers per meter). According to Nyborg’s theory of acoustic streaming in absorbing media, the steady flow arises from the time-averaged deposition of acoustic momentum in the propagation direction. Assume the beam is long, the flow is laminar and steady, end effects are negligible, and the volumetric force density is uniform over the beam cross-section. Outside the beam, the fluid is approximately stationary, and there is no imposed axial pressure gradient.\n\nUsing these assumptions and starting from first principles of momentum conservation for viscous flow, derive an expression for the centerline steady acoustic streaming velocity $U$ in terms of $I$, $a$, $\\alpha$, $\\mu$, and $c$, and then compute its numerical value for the following parameters:\n- $I = 5.0 \\times 10^{6}$ W/m$^{2}$,\n- $a = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ m,\n- $\\alpha = 6.0$ Np/m,\n- $\\mu = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ Pa·s,\n- $c = 1.50 \\times 10^{3}$ m/s,\n- $\\rho = 1.00 \\times 10^{3}$ kg/m$^{3}$.\n\nProvide the final numeric value of the centerline streaming velocity in meters per second and round your answer to three significant figures.

            "solution": "The physical origin of acoustic streaming in a fluid exposed to a continuous ultrasound beam can be understood from conservation of momentum and the fact that absorption dissipates acoustic momentum into the fluid as a steady body force. For an incompressible, Newtonian fluid, the governing momentum equation is the steady Navier–Stokes equation without inertia (the Stokes flow approximation), which is appropriate when the streaming Reynolds number is modest:\n$$\n\\mathbf{0} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^{2} \\mathbf{U} + \\mathbf{f},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{U}$ is the steady streaming velocity field, $p$ is the hydrodynamic pressure, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\\mathbf{f}$ is the time-averaged acoustic body force density arising from absorption.\n\nFor a traveling wave in an absorbing medium, Nyborg’s analysis relates the time-averaged volumetric force density to the local intensity through momentum absorption. The momentum flux associated with a plane acoustic wave is proportional to the intensity divided by the sound speed, and attenuation deposits momentum at a rate proportional to the attenuation coefficient. The resulting axial force density (in the beam direction) is\n$$\nf = \\frac{2 \\alpha I}{c}.\n$$\nWe treat $f$ as uniform over the beam cross-section by the given top-hat intensity assumption. We also assume no externally imposed axial pressure gradient within the focal region (so $\\partial p / \\partial z \\approx 0$), and that the steady flow is axisymmetric and fully developed along the beam axis, with the only nonzero velocity component $U(r)$ in the axial direction, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. Under these conditions, the axial component of the Stokes equation reduces to\n$$\n\\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dU}{dr} \\right) \\right) = - f,\n$$\nfor $0 \\le r \\le a$, with the no-slip boundary condition $U(a) = 0$ and regularity at $r = 0$.\n\nIntegrating twice with respect to $r$, and enforcing regularity and no-slip yields the classical parabolic profile for a uniformly forced cylinder:\n$$\nU(r) = \\frac{f}{4 \\mu} \\left( a^{2} - r^{2} \\right).\n$$\nTherefore, the centerline streaming velocity is\n$$\nU(0) = \\frac{f a^{2}}{4 \\mu} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2 \\alpha I}{c} \\right) a^{2}}{4 \\mu} = \\frac{\\alpha I a^{2}}{2 \\mu c}.\n$$\n\nThis expression reveals the scaling: $U$ is directly proportional to the intensity $I$ (stronger acoustic power deposits more momentum), directly proportional to the attenuation coefficient $\\alpha$ (greater absorption yields larger driving force), inversely proportional to the viscosity $\\mu$ (more viscous resistance reduces the flow), and proportional to $a^{2}$ (larger beam radius increases the viscous length scale over which the force acts). The dependence on $c$ is inverse: larger sound speed reduces the momentum deposition per unit intensity.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value using the provided parameters. First, compute the force density using the intermediate form, then the centerline velocity:\n$$\nf = \\frac{2 \\alpha I}{c} = \\frac{2 \\times 6.0 \\times \\left( 5.0 \\times 10^{6} \\right)}{1.50 \\times 10^{3}}.\n$$\nCompute the numerator:\n$$\n2 \\times 6.0 \\times \\left( 5.0 \\times 10^{6} \\right) = 12.0 \\times \\left( 5.0 \\times 10^{6} \\right) = 6.0 \\times 10^{7}.\n$$\nDivide by $c$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{7}}{1.50 \\times 10^{3}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{4}.\n$$\nThus $f = 4.0 \\times 10^{4}$ N/m$^{3}$. Next,\n$$\na^{2} = \\left( 3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\right)^{2} = 9.0 \\times 10^{-8}.\n$$\nCompute the numerator $f a^{2}$:\n$$\nf a^{2} = \\left( 4.0 \\times 10^{4} \\right) \\times \\left( 9.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\right) = 3.6 \\times 10^{-3}.\n$$\nCompute the denominator $4 \\mu$:\n$$\n4 \\mu = 4 \\times \\left( 3.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\right) = 1.4 \\times 10^{-2}.\n$$\nFinally,\n$$\nU(0) = \\frac{f a^{2}}{4 \\mu} = \\frac{3.6 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.4 \\times 10^{-2}} \\approx 2.571428571 \\times 10^{-1}.\n$$\nTherefore, the centerline streaming velocity is approximately $0.2571428571$ m/s. Rounded to three significant figures as requested, this is $0.257$ m/s.\n\nWe reiterate the scaling conclusion: $U \\propto I$ and $U \\propto \\alpha$, whereas $U \\propto \\mu^{-1}$, with the viscous and geometric dependence setting the magnitude via the factor $a^{2}/\\mu$.

            "solution": "The compressible inviscid base equations are the continuity equation $\\partial_t \\rho + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{v}) = 0$ and the momentum equation $\\rho \\partial_t \\mathbf{v} + \\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p$, together with a linear equation of state $p = c^2 \\rho'$ for small perturbations $\\rho'$.

Output $F$ in Newtons for each test case.\n\nScientific realism and edge cases:\n\n- In the matched, lossless case ($Z_1 = Z_0$, $\\alpha_1 = 0$), one obtains $r \\approx 0$, $t \\approx 1$, and $F \\approx 0$, as expected from momentum conservation with no reflection and no absorption.\n- In the highly reflective case ($Z_1 \\gg Z_0$ with negligible loss), $|r| \\to 1$, $|t| \\to 0$, yielding $F/A \\to 2 I_{\\mathrm{in}}/c_0$.\n- In the strongly absorbing, matched case ($Z_1 = Z_0$ and $\\alpha_1 d \\gg 1$), $t \\to 0$ and $r \\to 0$ so $F/A \\to I_{\\mathrm{in}}/c_0$.\n- The integration of the time-averaged momentum-flux tensor embodies the second-order origin of radiation forces in acoustic fields. In lossy media, the divergence of the time-averaged Reynolds stress acts as a body force driving acoustic streaming; in the present configuration, absorption within the slab and momentum exchange at the interfaces are consistent with such steady flows, though this program focuses on the radiation force via surface integration.\n\nThe code implements this algorithm in Python with complex arithmetic for the transfer matrix and outputs the four forces in a single line as specified.",
