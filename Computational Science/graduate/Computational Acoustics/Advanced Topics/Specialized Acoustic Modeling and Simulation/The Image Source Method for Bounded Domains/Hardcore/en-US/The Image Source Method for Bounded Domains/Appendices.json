            "problem": "You are to implement a program that computes early-time acoustic propagation in a three-dimensional rectangular room using the image source method. Start from the fundamental linear, lossless, homogeneous acoustic wave equation for the scalar acoustic pressure $p(\\mathbf{x},t)$,\n$$\n\\nabla^2 p(\\mathbf{x},t) - \\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p(\\mathbf{x},t)}{\\partial t^2} = -q(t)\\delta(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{s}),\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{s}\\in\\mathbb{R}^3$ is the source location, $q(t)$ is a compactly supported source time function, $c$ is the speed of sound, and $\\delta(\\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta distribution. Use the representation of the solution in terms of the free-space Green's function $G_0(\\mathbf{x},t)$ convolved with the source, and enforce wall interactions through the image source construction in a rectangular, bounded domain with planar walls. Assume specular reflection with frequency-independent, angle-independent wall reflection coefficients, and neglect diffraction and air absorption. Each specular path from the source to the receiver contributes an arrival at time $t = \\|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}_{\\text{img}}\\|/c$ with an amplitude that is the product of the spherical spreading factor and the wall reflection factors encountered by the ray, where $\\mathbf{r}\\in\\mathbb{R}^3$ is the receiver location and $\\mathbf{s}_{\\text{img}}$ is an image of the source produced by mirroring across walls.\n\nYour derivation must adhere to the following conceptual base: the scalar wave equation, superposition, the free-space Green's function in three dimensions, and specular reflections modeled by mirror sources and multiplicative, scalar reflection gains at each wall encounter. Do not invoke any unproven formulas; instead, reason from these stated bases to justify your algorithmic choices for enumerating images, computing travel times, and computing amplitudes. In particular, justify how to count the number of encounters with each wall for a straight-line segment in the unfolded (tiled) room representation, and how to aggregate arrivals that are geometrically distinct but produce identical travel times. You must treat the geometric multiplicity of arrivals, defined as the number of distinct image paths that share the same arrival time (within a given tolerance), and you must aggregate amplitudes of such coincident arrivals by linear summation.\n\nNumerical model assumptions:\n- Use the Euclidean norm $\\|\\cdot\\|$ to compute geometric distances in meters.\n- Use a spherical spreading factor $1/(4\\pi R)$, where $R$ is the path length in meters.\n- For the six planar walls, specify independent reflection coefficients $r_{x,0}$ and $r_{x,L_x}$ for the planes $x=0$ and $x=L_x$, $r_{y,0}$ and $r_{y,L_y}$ for the planes $y=0$ and $y=L_y$, and $r_{z,0}$ and $r_{z,L_z}$ for the planes $z=0$ and $z=L_z$. The net wall gain for a path is the product of the relevant wall coefficients, each raised to the power equal to the number of encounters with that wall along the path.\n- Treat coincident arrivals as those whose arrival times differ by at most a tolerance $\\Delta t$ and aggregate them into a single arrival with multiplicity equal to the number of coincident paths and amplitude equal to the sum of their individual amplitudes.\n- Explicitly specify the physical units of all parameters and results.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Develop an algorithm to enumerate image sources in the unfolded lattice by mirroring the source across all room walls along each coordinate axis. Use integer lattice indices for periodic translations and a binary parity to represent even/odd reflections along each axis. Devise a principled rule to count, for a given straight segment from the receiver to an image source in the unfolded space, how many times it crosses the infinite set of planes corresponding to each of the six walls; use this to determine the per-wall reflection exponents for the amplitude.\n- Sort all candidate paths by arrival time and group coincident arrivals using a tolerance $\\Delta t = 10^{-6}$ seconds.\n- Compute and return the first $N$ earliest groups of arrivals (time, amplitude, multiplicity).\n\nPhysical units and rounding:\n- Express all distances in meters and times in seconds.\n- Use $c=343$ meters per second for the speed of sound unless stated otherwise in the individual test case.\n- Report each arrival time rounded to $6$ decimal places (in seconds), each amplitude as a dimensionless scalar rounded to $8$ decimal places, and each multiplicity as an integer.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each case below, compute the first $N$ earliest arrival groups as specified. For each group, output the triple $[t,a,m]$ with $t$ in seconds, $a$ dimensionless, and $m$ an integer multiplicity.\n\n- Case A (general asymmetric room):\n  - Room dimensions: $(L_x,L_y,L_z)=(7.5,5.0,3.2)$ meters.\n  - Source: $\\mathbf{s}=(1.2,0.8,1.5)$ meters.\n  - Receiver: $\\mathbf{r}=(6.0,4.0,1.7)$ meters.\n  - Wall reflection coefficients: $r_{x,0}=0.9$, $r_{x,L_x}=0.8$, $r_{y,0}=0.85$, $r_{y,L_y}=0.9$, $r_{z,0}=0.7$, $r_{z,L_z}=0.6$.\n  - Speed of sound: $c=343$ meters per second.\n  - Number of earliest arrival groups: $N=8$.\n\n- Case B (square plan to expose multiplicity):\n  - Room dimensions: $(L_x,L_y,L_z)=(5.0,5.0,3.0)$ meters.\n  - Source: $\\mathbf{s}=(1.0,1.0,1.2)$ meters.\n  - Receiver: $\\mathbf{r}=(4.0,4.0,1.2)$ meters.\n  - Wall reflection coefficients: $r_{x,0}=1.0$, $r_{x,L_x}=1.0$, $r_{y,0}=1.0$, $r_{y,L_y}=1.0$, $r_{z,0}=1.0$, $r_{z,L_z}=1.0$.\n  - Speed of sound: $c=343$ meters per second.\n  - Number of earliest arrival groups: $N=6$.\n\n- Case C (nearby source and receiver with moderate absorption):\n  - Room dimensions: $(L_x,L_y,L_z)=(10.0,8.0,3.5)$ meters.\n  - Source: $\\mathbf{s}=(2.5,3.0,1.2)$ meters.\n  - Receiver: $\\mathbf{r}=(2.7,3.1,1.25)$ meters.\n  - Wall reflection coefficients: $r_{x,0}=0.6$, $r_{x,L_x}=0.6$, $r_{y,0}=0.6$, $r_{y,L_y}=0.6$, $r_{z,0}=0.6$, $r_{z,L_z}=0.6$.\n  - Speed of sound: $c=343$ meters per second.\n  - Number of earliest arrival groups: $N=5$.\n\nOutput format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with no whitespace characters. The line should be a list of per-case arrays; each per-case array must contain exactly $N$ triples $[t,a,m]$ in increasing order of $t$. For example, an output with two cases might look like $[[t_1,a_1,m_1],[t_2,a_2,m_2]],[[u_1,b_1,n_1],[u_2,b_2,n_2]]]$; your program must follow this structure for the three cases described.",
            "solution": "The user has requested the implementation of an algorithm to compute early-time acoustic propagation in a three-dimensional rectangular room using the image source method. The problem is to be solved starting from the fundamental acoustic wave equation and the principle of superposition.\n\n### Step 1: Theoretical Foundation\n\nThe governing equation for acoustic pressure $p(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ in a linear, lossless, homogeneous medium due to a point source is the scalar wave equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 p(\\mathbf{x},t) - \\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p(\\mathbf{x},t)}{\\partial t^2} = -q(t)\\delta(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{s})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is the spatial coordinate, $t$ is time, $c$ is the speed of sound, $\\mathbf{s}$ is the source position, $q(t)$ is the source time function, and $\\delta(\\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta distribution.\n\nThe solution in an unbounded (free) space is given by the convolution of the source function with the free-space Green's function, $G_0$. For an impulsive source, $q(t) = Q_0 \\delta(t)$, the pressure response at a receiver location $\\mathbf{r}$ is the impulse response:\n$$\np(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\frac{Q_0}{4\\pi\\|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}\\|} \\delta\\left(t - \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}\\|}{c}\\right)\n$$\nThis describes a single acoustic arrival at time $t = \\|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}\\|/c$ with an amplitude that decays with distance $R = \\|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}\\|$ due to spherical spreading, proportional to $1/R$. The problem specifies a spherical spreading factor of $1/(4\\pi R)$, which implies we can consider a normalized source strength. The \"amplitude\" of an arrival is therefore the coefficient of the Dirac delta function.\n\nTo model propagation in a bounded rectangular domain, we employ the method of images. The boundary conditions imposed by the walls are satisfied by introducing a set of virtual \"image\" sources. For a room defined by the volume $[0, L_x] \\times [0, L_y] \\times [0, L_z]$, each of the six walls acts as a mirror. A source $\\mathbf{s}$ reflects across a wall to create a first-order image source. This image source itself reflects across other walls, creating second-order images, and so on, ad infinitum. This process generates an infinite, three-dimensional lattice of image sources.\n\nBy the principle of superposition, the total pressure at the receiver is the sum of the contributions from the original source and all image sources, as if they were all radiating in free space:\n$$\np(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{s}_{\\text{img}} \\in \\text{ImageSet}} \\frac{A_{\\text{refl}}(\\mathbf{s}_{\\text{img}})}{4\\pi\\|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}_{\\text{img}}\\|} \\delta\\left(t - \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}_{\\text{img}}\\|}{c}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A_{\\text{refl}}(\\mathbf{s}_{\\text{img}})$ is the cumulative reflection gain for the path from the image source $\\mathbf{s}_{\\text{img}}$ to the receiver.\n\n### Step 2: Algorithmic Design\n\n**2.1. Enumerating Image Sources**\n\nAn image source's position can be systematically indexed by an integer vector $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3$. Each component $n_i$ corresponds to the reflection history along the $i$-th axis. We can derive a formula for the coordinates of the image source $\\mathbf{s}_{\\mathbf{n}}$ relative to the original source $\\mathbf{s}=(s_x, s_y, s_z)$ in a room of dimensions $\\mathbf{L}=(L_x, L_y, L_z)$.\n\nFor the $x$-coordinate, the sequence of reflections generates image positions at $s_x$ (no reflection, $n_x=0$), $2L_x-s_x$ (one reflection at $x=L_x$, image index corresponding to this is generated by odd integers), $-s_x$ (one reflection at $x=0$), and so on. This pattern can be formally expressed for an index $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ as:\n$$\ns_{x, n} = \\begin{cases} n L_x + s_x,  \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ (n+1)L_x - s_x,  \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe coordinates for the image source $\\mathbf{s}_{\\mathbf{n}}$ for $\\mathbf{n}=(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are thus $(s_{x, n_x}, s_{y, n_y}, s_{z, n_z})$, with each component calculated independently using the formula above. The original source corresponds to $\\mathbf{n}=(0,0,0)$.\n\n**2.2. Calculating Arrival Time and Path Length**\n\nFor each image source $\\mathbf{s}_{\\mathbf{n}}$, the path length $R_{\\mathbf{n}}$ is the Euclidean distance from the image source to the receiver $\\mathbf{r}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathbf{n}} = \\|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{s}_{\\mathbf{n}}\\| = \\sqrt{(r_x - s_{x,n_x})^2 + (r_y - s_{y,n_y})^2 + (r_z - s_{z,n_z})^2}\n$$\nThe corresponding arrival time $t_{\\mathbf{n}}$ is:\n$$\nt_{\\mathbf{n}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathbf{n}}}{c}\n$$\n\n**2.3. Calculating Arrival Amplitude**\n\nThe amplitude of each arrival has two components: the spherical spreading factor and the wall reflection gain. The problem defines the amplitude as the product of these two.\n$$\nA_{\\mathbf{n}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi R_{\\mathbf{n}}} \\times (\\text{Wall Reflection Gain})\n$$\nThe wall reflection gain is the product of the reflection coefficients of all walls encountered along the path. The exponent of each reflection coefficient is the number of times the path reflects off that specific wall. This must be determined from the image source index $\\mathbf{n}=(n_x, n_y, n_z)$.\n\nAs required, we devise a principled rule for this count. For the $x$-dimension, with walls at $x=0$ (coefficient $r_{x,0}$) and $x=L_x$ (coefficient $r_{x,L_x}$), the number of reflections $k_{x,0}$ and $k_{x,1}$ can be determined solely from the index $n_x$:\n- For $n_x  0$: The path involves $\\lfloor n_x/2 \\rfloor$ reflections on the $x=0$ wall and $\\lceil n_x/2 \\rceil$ reflections on the $x=L_x$ wall.\n- For $n_x  0$: The path involves $\\lceil |n_x|/2 \\rceil$ reflections on the $x=0$ wall and $\\lfloor |n_x|/2 \\rfloor$ reflections on the $x=L_x$ wall.\n- For $n_x = 0$: There are no reflections in the $x$-dimension, so $k_{x,0}=0$ and $k_{x,1}=0$.\n\nThese formulas can be implemented efficiently using integer arithmetic. For $n_x  0$, $k_{x,0} = n_x // 2$ and $k_{x,1} = (n_x+1) // 2$. For $n_x  0$, let $m_x = -n_x$, then $k_{x,0} = (m_x+1) // 2$ and $k_{x,1} = m_x // 2$.\n\nThe total reflection gain is then:\n$$\nA_{\\text{refl}} = r_{x,0}^{k_{x,0}} \\cdot r_{x,L_x}^{k_{x,1}} \\cdot r_{y,0}^{k_{y,0}} \\cdot r_{y,L_y}^{k_{y,1}} \\cdot r_{z,0}^{k_{z,0}} \\cdot r_{z,L_z}^{k_{z,1}}\n$$\nwhere the exponents for the $y$ and $z$ dimensions are calculated analogously from $n_y$ and $n_z$.\n\n**2.4. Implementation Strategy and Grouping**\n\nTo find the first $N$ arrivals, we must enumerate image sources in an order that roughly corresponds to increasing travel time. This is achieved by iterating the indices $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ in a cube centered at the origin, e.g., from $-K$ to $K$ for some integer $K$. A sufficiently large $K$ ensures that the earliest arrivals are captured.\n\nThe resulting list of individual arrivals, each a tuple of $(t_{\\mathbf{n}}, A_{\\mathbf{n}})$, is then sorted by time $t_{\\mathbf{n}}$.\n\nFinally, sorted arrivals are grouped based on the coincidence tolerance $\\Delta t = 10^{-6}$ s. We iterate through the sorted list, creating groups. A new group is started for the first arrival. Subsequent arrivals are added to the current group if their arrival time is within $\\Delta t$ of the first arrival's time in that group. When an arrival's time falls outside this tolerance, the current group is finalized and a new one is started. For each group, we sum the amplitudes of its constituent arrivals and count its multiplicity. The reported time for the group is the time of its first arrival.\n\nThis process yields a list of the earliest $N$ unique arrival groups, each described by its time, total amplitude, and multiplicity.\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Execution Summary\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case:\n1.  Define room dimensions, source/receiver positions, reflection coefficients, and the speed of sound.\n2.  Generate a list of image source indices $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ within a cubic range (e.g., $[-5, 5]$ for each component).\n3.  For each index, compute the image source position $\\mathbf{s}_{\\mathbf{n}}$, path length $R_{\\mathbf{n}}$, and arrival time $t_{\\mathbf{n}}$.\n4.  For each index, compute the number of reflections on each of the six walls, $k_{x,0}, k_{x,1}, \\dots, k_{z,1}$.\n5.  Calculate the total amplitude $A_{\\mathbf{n}}$ as the product of the reflection gain and the spherical spreading factor $1/(4\\pi R_{\\mathbf{n}})$.\n6.  Store all computed arrivals $(t, A)$ and sort them by time $t$.\n7.  Process the sorted list to group coincident arrivals within the tolerance $\\Delta t$, summing their amplitudes and counting multiplicity.\n8.  Select the first $N$ groups.\n9.  Format the results (time, amplitude, multiplicity) according to the specified rounding and string format rules.\n\nThis procedure, grounded in the physics of wave propagation and the geometry of reflections, provides a robust and correct solution to the stated problem.",

The constant $C$ is proportional to the source strength $Q(\\omega)$, but its specific form is not required for this analysis as it will cancel out.\n\nThe reflected field, $p_{r}(\\mathbf{r},\\omega)$, is modeled using the method of images. The planar boundary at $z=0$ is replaced by an image source located at $\\mathbf{s}'=(x_{s},y_{s},-h)$. The strength and phase of this image source are modified by the complex reflection coefficient $R(\\omega)$ of the boundary.

For this equality to hold, both their magnitudes and their phases must be equal.\n\n**Amplitude Condition:**\nWe equate the magnitudes of both sides of the equation.

Physically, a reflection coefficient magnitude greater than unity implies an active boundary that adds energy to the reflected wave, which is not characteristic of passive materials. The problem, however, is a formal mathematical exercise, and this is the required condition.\n\n**Phase Condition:**\nNext, we equate the phases of the two phasors.

Equality of phase holds up to an integer multiple of $2\\pi$:\n$$\nk r_{d} = k r_{i} + \\phi_{R}(\\omega) + \\pi + 2m\\pi \\quad \\text{for } m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nThe term $(2m+1)\\pi$ represents any odd integer multiple of $\\pi$. The total phase difference between the reflected and direct paths, $\\Delta\\psi = (k r_{i} + \\phi_{R}(\\omega)) - k r_{d}$, must be an odd multiple of $\\pi$ for destructive interference. Rearranging the phase equality to solve for the path difference gives:\n$$\nk(r_i - r_d) = -\\phi_R(\\omega) - (2m+1)\\pi\n$$\nSince $m$ is an arbitrary integer, the set of values for $-(2m+1)$ is the same as the set of values for $(2m'+1)$ where $m'$ is also an integer. We can therefore write the condition more cleanly as:\n$$\nk(r_i - r_d) + \\phi_R(\\omega) = (2m+1)\\pi\n$$\n\n**Final Expression for Path-Length Difference:**\nThe problem asks for an expression for the required path-length difference, $\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{null}}(\\omega) = r_{i} - r_{d}$. We can solve for this quantity directly from the phase condition:\n$$\nk \\Delta r_{\\mathrm{null}}(\\omega) = (2m+1)\\pi - \\phi_{R}(\\omega)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{null}}(\\omega) = \\frac{(2m+1)\\pi - \\phi_{R}(\\omega)}{k}\n$$\nHere, the integer $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ enumerates the discrete set of interference conditions, leading to different spatial locations (or frequencies) where nulls can occur. The expression is dimensionally correct, as $k$ has units of $\\text{radians}/\\text{meter}$ and the numerator is in radians, yielding a result in meters.",
