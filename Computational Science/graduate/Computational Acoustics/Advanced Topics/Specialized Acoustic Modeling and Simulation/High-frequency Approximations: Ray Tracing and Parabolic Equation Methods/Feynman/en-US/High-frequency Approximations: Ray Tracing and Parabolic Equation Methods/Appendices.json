            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the turning depth for a sound ray in a two-dimensional medium with a linearly depth-dependent sound speed profile. The solution proceeds from the fundamental conservation law governing ray propagation in a stratified medium.\n\nThe given sound speed profile is $c(z) = c_0 + \\gamma z$, where $z$ is the depth, $c_0$ is the sound speed at the surface ($z=0$), and $\\gamma$ is the constant positive gradient. The ray is launched from the origin $(0,0)$ with an initial grazing angle $\\theta_0$ relative to the horizontal.\n\nIn a medium where the refractive index (and thus the sound speed) varies only with one coordinate (in this case, depth $z$), Snell's Law in its differential form holds. This law is equivalent to the statement provided in the problem: the horizontal component of the slowness vector is conserved along the ray path.\n\nLet $\\theta(z)$ be the local grazing angle of the ray at depth $z$. The slowness vector $\\mathbf{s}$ has a magnitude of $|\\mathbf{s}| = 1/c(z)$. Its horizontal component, $s_x$, is given by:\n$$ s_x = \\frac{\\cos(\\theta(z))}{c(z)} $$\nThe conservation of this component implies that it is a constant along the entire ray trajectory. We can evaluate this constant, known as the ray parameter $p$, using the initial conditions at the source ($z=0$):\n$$ p = \\frac{\\cos(\\theta(0))}{c(0)} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_0}{c_0} $$\nTherefore, for any point on the ray path, the following relationship, which is a form of Snell's Law, must be satisfied:\n$$ \\frac{\\cos(\\theta(z))}{c(z)} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_0}{c_0} $$\nThe task requires integrating the ray equations to find the path $z(x)$. The kinematic relation for the slope of the ray is $\\frac{dz}{dx} = \\tan(\\theta(z))$. From Snell's Law above, we can express $\\cos(\\theta(z)) = \\frac{c(z)}{c_0}\\cos\\theta_0$. This allows us to write $\\tan(\\theta(z)) = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2(\\theta(z))}}{\\cos(\\theta(z))}$, which leads to a separable differential equation for $z(x)$. While its integration confirms the ray path is an arc of a circle, we can find the turning depth without explicitly solving for $z(x)$.\n\nThe turning depth, which we denote as $z_{\\mathrm{t}}$, is the maximum depth the ray reaches. At this point, the ray's trajectory becomes momentarily horizontal before it begins to ascend. A horizontal trajectory corresponds to a local grazing angle of zero.\n$$ \\theta(z_{\\mathrm{t}}) = 0 $$\nWe can now apply this turning condition to the Snell's Law equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\cos(\\theta(z_{\\mathrm{t}}))}{c(z_{\\mathrm{t}})} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_0}{c_0} $$\nSubstituting $\\theta(z_{\\mathrm{t}}) = 0$ and using the fact that $\\cos(0) = 1$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{1}{c(z_{\\mathrm{t}})} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_0}{c_0} $$\nNext, we substitute the expression for the sound speed at the turning depth, $c(z_{\\mathrm{t}}) = c_0 + \\gamma z_{\\mathrm{t}}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{c_0 + \\gamma z_{\\mathrm{t}}} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_0}{c_0} $$\nNow, we solve this algebraic equation for $z_{\\mathrm{t}}$. By taking the reciprocal of both sides, we obtain:\n$$ c_0 + \\gamma z_{\\mathrm{t}} = \\frac{c_0}{\\cos\\theta_0} $$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $z_{\\mathrm{t}}$:\n$$ \\gamma z_{\\mathrm{t}} = \\frac{c_0}{\\cos\\theta_0} - c_0 $$\n$$ \\gamma z_{\\mathrm{t}} = c_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta_0} - 1 \\right) $$\nFinally, dividing by the gradient $\\gamma$ (given as $\\gamma > 0$) yields the expression for the turning depth:\n$$ z_{\\mathrm{t}} = \\frac{c_0}{\\gamma} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta_0} - 1 \\right) $$\nThis is the required closed-form symbolic expression for the turning depth in terms of the given parameters $c_0$, $\\gamma$, and $\\theta_0$.",

Second, we find the asymptotic form of the exact solution and match it with the parabolic equation solution to determine the normalization constant $A$.\n\nPart 1: Solution of the Parabolic Equation\n\nWe are tasked with solving the standard parabolic equation (PE) for the slowly varying envelope function $\\psi(r,z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial r} = \\frac{i}{2 k} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nsubject to the initial condition at the source range $r=0$:\n$$\n\\psi(0,z) = A \\, \\delta(z - z_s)\n$$\nThis linear partial differential equation is amenable to the Fourier transform method with respect to the spatial coordinate $z$.

The transform of $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial z^2}$ is $(i k_z)^2 \\hat{\\psi} = -k_z^2 \\hat{\\psi}$. The PE thus becomes an ordinary differential equation in the variable $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\hat{\\psi}}{d r} = \\frac{i}{2 k} (-k_z^2) \\hat{\\psi} = -\\frac{i k_z^2}{2k} \\hat{\\psi}\n$$\nThis first-order ODE has the general solution:\n$$\n\\hat{\\psi}(r, k_z) = C(k_z) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i k_z^2 r}{2k}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C(k_z)$ is a function determined by the initial condition at $r=0$.

For the slowly varying amplitude term, $1/\\sqrt{R}$, it is sufficient to use the leading-order approximation $R \\approx r$.Substituting these into the asymptotic expression for $p_{\\mathrm{exact}}$:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{exact}}(r,z) \\sim S \\, \\frac{i}{4} \\, \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi k r}} \\exp\\left(i\\left(k\\left(r + \\frac{(z-z_s)^2}{2r}\\right) - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to match the structure of our PE solution:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{exact}}(r,z) \\sim S \\, \\left(\\frac{i}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi k r}} \\exp(-i\\pi/4)\\right) \\exp\\left(ikr + \\frac{ik(z-z_s)^2}{2r}\\right)\n$$\nLet's simplify the pre-factor in the parentheses.

Let's write $p(r,z)$ in a comparable form by noting that $1/\\sqrt{i} = \\exp(-i\\pi/4)$:\n$$\np(r,z) = A \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2\\pi i r}} \\exp(\\dots) = A \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}\\sqrt{i}} \\exp(\\dots) = \\frac{A \\sqrt{k} \\exp(-i\\pi/4)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\exp(\\dots)\n$$\nFor the two expressions to match for all $r$ and $z$ in the asymptotic regime, their amplitudes and phases must be identical. The exponential terms are already identical. We equate the pre-factors:\n$$\n\\frac{A \\sqrt{k} \\exp(-i\\pi/4)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} = \\frac{S \\exp(i\\pi/4)}{2 \\sqrt{2\\pi k r}}\n$$\nWe can cancel the term $\\sqrt{2\\pi r}$ from both denominators.\n$$\nA \\sqrt{k} \\exp(-i\\pi/4) = \\frac{S \\exp(i\\pi/4)}{2 \\sqrt{k}}\n$$\nSolving for $A$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{S}{2 \\sqrt{k} \\sqrt{k}} \\frac{\\exp(i\\pi/4)}{\\exp(-i\\pi/4)} = \\frac{S}{2k} \\exp\\left(i(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - (-\\frac{\\pi}{4}))\\right) = \\frac{S}{2k} \\exp(i\\pi/2)\n$$\nSince $\\exp(i\\pi/2) = i$, the final expression for $A$ is:\n$$\nA = \\frac{iS}{2k}\n$$\nAs a check on the physical units, the problem states that $S$ has units of Pascals ($Pa$) and $k$ has units of inverse meters ($m^{-1}$).

The goal is to empirically determine the order of convergence, $p$, of this numerical scheme with respect to the range step size, $\\Delta r$.\n\nThe governing equation for the complex pressure envelope, $\\psi(r,x,z)$, is the narrow-angle PE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial r} = \\frac{i}{2 k_0} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial z^2} \\right) + i k_0 V(r,x,z)\\,\\psi\n$$\nThis is an evolution equation in the range coordinate $r$. It can be written abstractly as $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial r} = (A + B(r))\\psi$, where $A$ is the diffraction operator and $B(r)$ is the potential operator.\n- The diffraction operator is $A = \\frac{i}{2k_0}\\nabla_\\perp^2$, where $\\nabla_\\perp^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}$.\n- The potential operator is $B(r) = i k_0 V(r,x,z)$, a multiplication operator.\n\nThe Strang-splitting method is a second-order accurate technique for advancing the solution from range $r$ to $r+\\Delta r$. It approximates the formal solution $\\psi(r+\\Delta r) = \\exp(\\Delta r(A+B))\\psi(r)$ by symmetrically splitting the operators:\n$$\n\\psi(r+\\Delta r) \\approx \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Delta r}{2} B\\!\\left(r+\\frac{\\Delta r}{2}\\right)\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(\\Delta r\\, A\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Delta r}{2} B\\!\\left(r+\\frac{\\Delta r}{2}\\right)\\right)\\psi(r)\n$$\nHere, the potential $B$ is evaluated at the midpoint of the range step, $r_{\\text{mid}} = r + \\Delta r/2$, to maintain second-order accuracy for the range-dependent potential.\n\nThe algorithmic implementation for a single range step consists of three sequential substeps:\n1.  **First Potential Half-Step**: The field $\\psi$ is multiplied by a phase factor. On a discrete grid $(x_j, z_k)$, this is a pointwise multiplication:\n    $\\psi \\leftarrow \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta r}{2} B(r_{\\text{mid}})\\right) \\psi = \\exp\\left(i k_0 \\frac{\\Delta r}{2} V(r_{\\text{mid}}, x_j, z_k)\\right) \\psi(r, x_j, z_k)$.\n\n2.  **Diffraction Full-Step**: The operator $\\exp(\\Delta r A)$ is most efficiently applied in the spatial Fourier domain. The algorithm is:\n    a. Compute the 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the field: $\\hat{\\psi}(k_x, k_z) = \\mathcal{F}\\{\\psi(x,z)\\}$.\n    b. Multiply by the diffraction phase factor in the spectral domain: $\\hat{\\psi} \\leftarrow \\exp\\left(-i \\Delta r \\frac{k_x^2 + k_z^2}{2 k_0}\\right) \\hat{\\psi}$. The transverse wavenumbers $k_x$ and $k_z$ correspond to the discrete grid and are provided by standard FFT frequency routines.\n    c. Compute the 2D inverse FFT to return to the spatial domain: $\\psi = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{\\hat{\\psi}\\}$.\n\n3.  **Second Potential Half-Step**: This is identical to the first step, applying the same phase multiplication to the result of the diffraction step.\n\nThis entire sequence is repeated for $N_{\\text{steps}} = \\text{round}(R/\\Delta r)$ iterations to propagate the initial field $\\psi(0,x,z)$ to the final range $R$.\n\nTo find the empirical convergence rate $p$, the simulation is run three times for each test case with a fixed final range $R$ and transverse grid, but with three different range steps: a coarse step $\\Delta r_c$, a fine step $\\Delta r_f = \\Delta r_c/2$, and a very fine reference step $\\Delta r_{\\text{ref}}$. This yields three final fields: $\\psi_c$, $\\psi_f$, and $\\psi_{\\text{ref}}$. The discrete $L^2$ error is computed for the coarse and fine solutions relative to the reference solution:\n$$\nE_c = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{j,k} \\left| \\psi_c(R, x_j, z_k) - \\psi_{\\text{ref}}(R, x_j, z_k) \\right|^2 \\Delta x \\Delta z }\n$$\n$$\nE_f = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{j,k} \\left| \\psi_f(R, x_j, z_k) - \\psi_{\\text{ref}}(R, x_j, z_k) \\right|^2 \\Delta x \\Delta z }\n$$\nFor a method with convergence order $p$, the error $E$ is proportional to $(\\Delta r)^p$. Thus, the ratio of errors is related to the ratio of step sizes: $E_c / E_f \\approx (\\Delta r_c / \\Delta r_f)^p$. Solving for $p$ gives the formula for the empirical rate:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\log(E_c/E_f)}{\\log(\\Delta r_c/\\Delta r_f)}\n$$\nSince $\\Delta r_c / \\Delta r_f = 2$ for all test cases, this simplifies to $p = \\log_2(E_c/E_f)$. For the second-order Strang-splitting method, the expected value of $p$ is approximately $2$.\n\nThe implementation will define a function to perform the PE propagation for a given set of parameters. This function will be called for each combination of test case and range step ($\\Delta r_c, \\Delta r_f, \\Delta r_{\\text{ref}}$) to generate the necessary fields for computing $p$.",
