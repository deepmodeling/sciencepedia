Mastering this step is fundamental to implementing accurate Immersed Boundary (IB) or Ghost Fluid Methods (GFM).",

It is a well-defined exercise in numerical methods applied to computational geometry.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe boundary of the inclusion is implicitly defined by the equation $\\phi(x,y)=0$. The calculations are performed at the physical point $(x,y)=(h,0)$, which corresponds to the grid index $(i_0, j_0)=(1,0)$.\n\n**Part 1: Outward Unit Normal Vector ($\\mathbf{n}$)**\n\nThe gradient vector, $\\nabla \\phi = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right)$, is orthogonal to the level sets of $\\phi$. The outward unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is obtained by normalizing the gradient:\n$$ \\mathbf{n} = \\frac{\\nabla \\phi}{|\\nabla \\phi|} = \\frac{(\\phi_x, \\phi_y)}{\\sqrt{\\phi_x^2 + \\phi_y^2}} $$\nwhere subscripts denote partial differentiation. For a signed distance function, $|\\nabla \\phi|=1$, so $\\mathbf{n} = \\nabla \\phi$. We will use the general formula and verify this property. The first-order derivatives $\\phi_x$ and $\\phi_y$ at $(i_0, j_0)=(1,0)$ are approximated using second-order central differences:\n$$ \\phi_x|_{(1,0)} \\approx \\frac{\\phi_{1+1, 0} - \\phi_{1-1, 0}}{2h} = \\frac{\\phi_{2,0} - \\phi_{0,0}}{2h} $$\n$$ \\phi_y|_{(1,0)} \\approx \\frac{\\phi_{1, 0+1} - \\phi_{1, 0-1}}{2h} = \\frac{\\phi_{1,1} - \\phi_{1,-1}}{2h} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\phi_x|_{(1,0)} \\approx \\frac{h - (-h)}{2h} = \\frac{2h}{2h} = 1 $$\n$$ \\phi_y|_{(1,0)} \\approx \\frac{(\\sqrt{2}-1)h - (\\sqrt{2}-1)h}{2h} = \\frac{0}{2h} = 0 $$\nThe gradient vector is numerically estimated as $\\nabla \\phi \\approx (1,0)$. The magnitude is $|\\nabla \\phi| \\approx \\sqrt{1^2+0^2} = 1$.\nThe outward unit normal vector is thus:\n$$ \\mathbf{n} \\approx \\frac{(1,0)}{1} = (1,0) $$\n\n**Part 2: Curvature ($\\kappa$)**\n\nThe curvature $\\kappa$ of a level set curve $\\phi(x,y)=0$ is given by the divergence of the unit normal vector, $\\kappa = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$. In terms of partial derivatives of $\\phi$, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{\\phi_x^2 \\phi_{yy} - 2\\phi_x \\phi_y \\phi_{xy} + \\phi_y^2 \\phi_{xx}}{(\\phi_x^2 + \\phi_y^2)^{3/2}} $$\nTo evaluate this expression, we need the second partial derivatives of $\\phi$ at $(1,0)$. We use second-order central differences for $\\phi_{xx}$ and $\\phi_{yy}$, and the specified symmetric $4$-point formula for $\\phi_{xy}$.\n\nThe second derivative $\\phi_{xx}$ is:\n$$ \\phi_{xx}|_{(1,0)} \\approx \\frac{\\phi_{1+1,0} - 2\\phi_{1,0} + \\phi_{1-1,0}}{h^2} = \\frac{\\phi_{2,0} - 2\\phi_{1,0} + \\phi_{0,0}}{h^2} $$\nSubstituting values:\n$$ \\phi_{xx}|_{(1,0)} \\approx \\frac{h - 2(0) + (-h)}{h^2} = \\frac{0}{h^2} = 0 $$\n\nThe second derivative $\\phi_{yy}$ is:\n$$ \\phi_{yy}|_{(1,0)} \\approx \\frac{\\phi_{1,0+1} - 2\\phi_{1,0} + \\phi_{1,0-1}}{h^2} = \\frac{\\phi_{1,1} - 2\\phi_{1,0} + \\phi_{1,-1}}{h^2} $$\nSubstituting values:\n$$ \\phi_{yy}|_{(1,0)} \\approx \\frac{(\\sqrt{2}-1)h - 2(0) + (\\sqrt{2}-1)h}{h^2} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{2}-1)h}{h^2} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{h} $$\n\nThe mixed partial derivative $\\phi_{xy}$ is:\n$$ \\phi_{xy}|_{(1,0)} \\approx \\frac{\\phi_{1+1, 0+1} - \\phi_{1-1, 0+1} - \\phi_{1+1, 0-1} + \\phi_{1-1, 0-1}}{4h^2} = \\frac{\\phi_{2,1} - \\phi_{0,1} - \\phi_{2,-1} + \\phi_{0,-1}}{4h^2} $$\nSubstituting values:\n$$ \\phi_{xy}|_{(1,0)} \\approx \\frac{(\\sqrt{5}-1)h - 0 - (\\sqrt{5}-1)h + 0}{4h^2} = \\frac{0}{4h^2} = 0 $$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values of the derivatives into the curvature formula:\n-   $\\phi_x \\approx 1$\n-   $\\phi_y \\approx 0$\n-   $\\phi_{xx} \\approx 0$\n-   $\\phi_{yy} \\approx \\frac{2(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{h}$\n-   $\\phi_{xy} \\approx 0$\n\n$$ \\kappa \\approx \\frac{(1)^2 \\left(\\frac{2(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{h}\\right) - 2(1)(0)(0) + (0)^2 (0)}{( (1)^2 + (0)^2 )^{3/2}} $$\n$$ \\kappa \\approx \\frac{\\frac{2(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{h}}{1^{3/2}} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{h} $$\nThe final step is to compute the numerical value. Given $h = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ m:\n$$ \\kappa \\approx \\frac{2(\\sqrt{2} - 1)}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\nUsing $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356$:\n$$ \\kappa \\approx \\frac{2(1.41421356 - 1)}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{2(0.41421356)}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{0.82842712}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 828.42712 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $828.4 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.

If you introduce any acronym, spell it out upon first use; for example, Level Set Method (LSM), Ghost Fluid Method (GFM), and Finite Difference (FD).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of closed-form expressions for the ghost-cell pressure $p_{-1}$ and velocity $u_{-1}$ used in a Finite Difference (FD) scheme. These expressions must enforce a specific acoustic impedance boundary condition at an immersed interface, consistent with the principles of the Ghost Fluid Method (GFM).\n\nThe solution strategy involves establishing a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns, $p_{-1}$ and $u_{-1}$, and then solving this system algebraically.\n\nThe first equation is derived by enforcing the impedance boundary condition at the interface location $x_I$. The problem states that the values of pressure $p(x_I, t)$ and velocity $u(x_I, t)$ at the interface are obtained via linear interpolation between the nearest interior node ($i=0$) and the exterior ghost node ($i=-1$):\n$$\np(x_{I},t) = (1-\\theta)\\, p_{0} + \\theta\\, p_{-1}\n$$\n$$\nu(x_{I},t) = (1-\\theta)\\, u_{0} + \\theta\\, u_{-1}\n$$\nThe impedance boundary condition at the interface is given as $p(x_{I},t) = Z\\, u(x_{I},t)$.

The interface normal points in the negative $x$-direction, meaning it points from the fluid domain towards the ghost-cell region. The characteristic variable that carries information from the fluid domain towards the boundary is the one propagating in the negative $x$-direction, which is $W_2 = p - Z_0 u$. The GFM prescribes a value for this quantity in the ghost region by extrapolating it from the fluid domain. The simplest, zeroth-order extrapolation assumes this quantity is constant across the interface. Therefore, we set its value at the ghost node $x_{-1}$ equal to its value at the interior node $x_0$:\n$$\np(x_{-1},t) - Z_{0} u(x_{-1},t) = p(x_{0},t) - Z_{0} u(x_{0},t)\n$$\nIn our discrete notation, this becomes the second required equation:\n$$\np_{-1} - Z_{0} u_{-1} = p_{0} - Z_{0} u_{0}\n\\quad \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $p_{-1}$ and $u_{-1}$.

The pressure-gradient term becomes the jump in pressure by the divergence theorem applied in the normal direction:\n$$\n-\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{A}}\\int_{\\mathcal{V}_{\\epsilon}}\\nabla p\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\,\\mathrm{d}V=-[p].\n$$\nFor the singular force, use the co-area formula for the Level Set (LS) representation, $\\mathrm{d}V=\\mathrm{d}S\\,\\mathrm{d}r$ and $\\delta(\\phi)\\,|\\nabla \\phi|\\,\\mathrm{d}r=\\delta(r)\\,\\mathrm{d}r$, giving\n$$\n\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{A}}\\int_{\\mathcal{V}_{\\epsilon}} f_{s}\\,\\delta(\\phi)\\,\\mathrm{d}V=\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{A}}\\int_{\\text{patch}} f_{s}\\left(\\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon}\\delta(\\phi)\\,|\\nabla \\phi|\\,\\mathrm{d}r\\right)\\mathrm{d}S=\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{A}}\\int_{\\text{patch}} f_{s}\\,\\mathrm{d}S=f_{s}.\n$$\nCollecting these limits yields the distributional momentum balance across the interface in the normal direction:\n$$\n-[p]+f_{s}=0\\quad \\Longrightarrow\\quad [p]=f_{s}.\n$$\nTo determine $f_{s}$, apply Newton’s second law to the membrane per unit area. The membrane undergoes normal displacement $\\zeta$ and has mass per area $\\mu_{s}$ and linear normal stiffness per area $\\kappa_{s}$. The net external force per unit area on the membrane consists of the sum of fluid tractions from both sides, which for an inviscid fluid of pressure $p$ is $\\mathbf{t}^{-}+\\mathbf{t}^{+}=(p^{-}-p^{+})\\mathbf{n}=-[p]\\,\\mathbf{n}$, plus the restoring structural force $-\\kappa_{s}\\,\\zeta\\,\\mathbf{n}$ opposing displacement.
