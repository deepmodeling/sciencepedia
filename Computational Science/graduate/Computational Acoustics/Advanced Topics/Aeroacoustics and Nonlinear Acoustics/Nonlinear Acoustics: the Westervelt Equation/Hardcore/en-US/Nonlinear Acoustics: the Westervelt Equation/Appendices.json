            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in physical acoustics concerning thermoviscous dissipation. All necessary physical quantities and thermodynamic relations are provided, enabling a unique and meaningful solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Sound Diffusivity and Attenuation Coefficient**\n\nThe propagation of sound in a thermoviscous fluid is governed by the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy, augmented by constitutive relations for stress (Newtonian fluid) and heat flux (Fourier's law). For small-amplitude perturbations, these equations can be linearized. Combining these linearized equations yields a single partial differential equation for the acoustic pressure perturbation, $p$. This equation takes the form of a wave equation with a dissipative term, often referred to as the thermoviscous wave equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 p - \\frac{1}{c_0^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} + \\frac{\\delta}{c_0^4} \\frac{\\partial^3 p}{\\partial t^3} = 0 $$\nwhere $c_0$ is the small-signal (isentropic) speed of sound and $\\delta$ is the sound diffusivity.\n\nThe sound diffusivity, $\\delta$, consolidates the effects of viscosity and thermal conduction. Its expression is derived by accounting for the dissipative terms arising from the momentum and energy equations. The viscous stress tensor in the linearized momentum equation contributes a term proportional to the bulk viscosity, $\\mu_b$, and the shear viscosity, $\\mu$. The heat conduction in the linearized energy equation, coupled with thermodynamic state relations, contributes a term proportional to the thermal conductivity, $\\kappa$. The resulting expression for the sound diffusivity is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\left( \\mu_b + \\frac{4}{3}\\mu \\right) + \\frac{\\kappa}{\\rho_0 c_p} (\\gamma - 1) $$\nHere, $\\rho_0$ is the equilibrium density, $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $\\gamma = c_p/c_v$ is the ratio of specific heats ($c_v$ being the specific heat at constant volume). The first term represents dissipation due to viscosity, and the second represents dissipation due to thermal conduction.\n\nNext, we derive the leading-order formula for the attenuation coefficient, $\\alpha$. We consider a plane, time-harmonic pressure wave propagating in the $x$-direction, given by the ansatz $p(x,t) = \\Re\\{\\hat{p}\\exp[i(kx - \\omega t)]\\}$, where $\\hat{p}$ is the complex amplitude, $k$ is the complex wavenumber, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. Substituting this into the thermoviscous wave equation yields the dispersion relation for $k$:\n$$ (ik)^2 p - \\frac{1}{c_0^2}(-i\\omega)^2 p + \\frac{\\delta}{c_0^4}(-i\\omega)^3 p = 0 $$\nDividing by $p$ (assuming $p \\neq 0$), we get:\n$$ -k^2 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c_0^2} + i \\frac{\\omega^3 \\delta}{c_0^4} = 0 $$\n$$ k^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c_0^2} \\left( 1 + i \\frac{\\omega \\delta}{c_0^2} \\right) $$\nSolving for $k$:\n$$ k = \\frac{\\omega}{c_0} \\sqrt{1 + i \\frac{\\omega \\delta}{c_0^2}} $$\nFor small losses, the dissipative term is small, i.e., $\\omega \\delta / c_0^2 \\ll 1$. We can therefore use the first-order Taylor expansion $\\sqrt{1+z} \\approx 1 + z/2$ for small $z$. Let $z = i \\omega \\delta / c_0^2$.\n$$ k \\approx \\frac{\\omega}{c_0} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2} i \\frac{\\omega \\delta}{c_0^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\omega}{c_0} + i \\frac{\\omega^2 \\delta}{2c_0^3} $$\nThe attenuation coefficient $\\alpha$ is defined as the imaginary part of the wavenumber, $\\alpha = \\Im\\{k\\}$. Thus, the leading-order small-loss formula for $\\alpha$ is:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\omega^2 \\delta}{2c_0^3} $$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation for Water**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the ratio of specific heats, $\\gamma$. The problem provides the thermodynamic identity $\\gamma - 1 = \\alpha_T^{2} T / (\\rho_0 c_p \\kappa_T)$, where $\\alpha_T$ is the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient. Using the provided values:\n- $\\alpha_T = 2.07 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}$\n- $T = 293.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $\\rho_0 = 998\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n- $c_p = 4182\\ \\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $\\kappa_T = 4.6 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{Pa^{-1}}$\n\n$$ \\gamma - 1 = \\frac{(2.07 \\times 10^{-4})^2 \\times 293.15}{998 \\times 4182 \\times (4.6 \\times 10^{-10})} = \\frac{1.25593 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.92111 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 0.00653744 $$\nThis value for $\\gamma-1$ is small, as expected for a liquid where $c_p \\approx c_v$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the sound diffusivity, $\\delta$, using its derived expression.

The angular frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}}$. We use the derived formula for $\\alpha$ along with $c_0 = 1482\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ and the unrounded value for $\\delta$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\omega^2 \\delta}{2c_0^3} = \\frac{(2\\pi \\times 10^6)^2 \\times (4.145226 \\times 10^{-6})}{2 \\times (1482)^3} $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{(3.94784 \\times 10^{13}) \\times (4.145226 \\times 10^{-6})}{2 \\times (3.25533 \\times 10^9)} = \\frac{1.63653 \\times 10^8}{6.51066 \\times 10^9} \\approx 0.025136\\ \\mathrm{Np\\,m^{-1}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\alpha = 0.02514\\ \\mathrm{Np\\,m^{-1}}$.

In a pseudo-spectral method, the nonlinear term $q(x) = p(x)^2$ is computed by transforming $p(x)$ to grid-point values, squaring them pointwise, and then transforming back to spectral coefficients $\\hat{q}_m$. This procedure is mathematically equivalent to a *circular convolution* of the spectral coefficients of $p(x)$:\n$$ \\hat{q}_m = \\sum_{l+j \\equiv m \\pmod N} \\hat{p}_l \\hat{p}_j $$\nThis is in contrast to the exact analytical result, which corresponds to a *linear convolution*:\n$$ \\hat{q}_m^{\\text{exact}} = (\\hat{p} * \\hat{p})_m = \\sum_{l} \\hat{p}_l \\hat{p}_{m-l} $$\nAliasing occurs when the circular convolution gives a different result from the linear convolution. Specifically, a high-frequency component generated by the product, with mode index $m_{\\text{true}}$, can be \"misinterpreted\" as a lower-frequency component with mode index $m_{\\text{alias}}$ if $m_{\\text{true}} \\equiv m_{\\text{alias}} \\pmod N$. For the standard DFT indexing, if a true mode index $m_{\\text{true}}$ falls outside the principal range, typically $[ -N/2, N/2-1 ]$ or similar, its alias is $m_{\\text{alias}} = m_{\\text{true}} + k N$ for an integer $k$ chosen to bring the alias into the principal range.\n\nThe problem states the initial condition is $p(x,0) = A \\cos(k_0 x)$, where $k_0 = 2\\pi m_0/L$. Using Euler's formula, $p(x,0) = \\frac{A}{2}(e^{\\mathrm{i} k_0 x} + e^{-\\mathrm{i} k_0 x})$. The only non-zero spectral coefficients at $t=0$ are $\\hat{p}_{m_0} = A/2$ and $\\hat{p}_{-m_0} = A/2$.\nThe analytical product is $p(x,0)^2 = A^2 \\cos^2(k_0 x) = A^2 \\frac{1+\\cos(2k_0 x)}{2} = \\frac{A^2}{2} + \\frac{A^2}{2}\\cos(2k_0 x)$. This generates a DC component (mode $m=0$) and a second harmonic (modes $m = \\pm 2m_0$).\n\nMore generally, if a signal contains modes up to an index $K$, i.e., $\\hat{p}_m \\neq 0$ only for $|m| \\le K$, the quadratic product $p^2$ will generate modes up to index $2K$ via convolution.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In the pseudo-spectral evaluation of $p^2$ on $N$ points, the second harmonic at index $2 m_0$ aliases to index $m_{\\mathrm{alias}} = 2 m_0 - N$ whenever $2 m_0  N/2$, so that energy at the true wavenumber $2 k_0$ wraps into $k_{\\mathrm{alias}} = 2\\pi (2 m_0 - N)/L$.**\n\nThis statement describes the fundamental mechanism of aliasing in a DFT. The range of uniquely represented mode indices on an $N$-point grid is typically chosen as $m \\in [-N/2, N/2-1]$. A physical frequency corresponding to a mode index $m_{\\text{true}}$ outside this range will be aliased to a mode $m_{\\text{alias}}$ within the range, satisfying $m_{\\text{true}} \\equiv m_{\\text{alias}} \\pmod N$.\nIf the true second harmonic index is $m_{\\text{true}} = 2m_0$ and it satisfies $2m_0  N/2$, it lies outside the uniquely represented positive wavenumber range. The standard aliasing rule maps it back into the principal range by subtracting $N$. The aliased index is $m_{\\text{alias}} = 2m_0 - N$.\nSince the problem states $m_0 \\le N/2-1$, the highest possible value for $2m_0$ is $2(N/2-1) = N-2$. So, if $N/2  2m_0 \\le N-2$, then the alias $m_{\\text{alias}} = 2m_0 - N$ will be in the range $N/2 - N  m_{\\text{alias}} \\le N-2-N$, which is $-N/2  m_{\\text{alias}} \\le -2$. This falls within the valid range of negative mode indices. The corresponding aliased wavenumber is indeed $k_{\\text{alias}} = 2\\pi \\, m_{\\text{alias}}/L = 2\\pi (2m_0-N)/L$. The statement is a correct description of aliasing.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Zero-padding the Fourier spectrum to $M = 3 N / 2$ points, transforming to physical space, computing $p^2$ pointwise on $M$ points, and then transforming back and truncating to the original retained band $|m| \\le N/2 - 1$ guarantees that no aliased energy from quadratic interactions contaminates the retained coefficients.**\n\nThis describes the \"3/2 rule\" for de-aliasing quadratic nonlinearities. The original spectrum contains modes in the set $S_N = \\{m \\in \\mathbb{Z} : |m| \\le N/2-1\\} \\cup \\{-N/2\\}$. The convolution of this spectrum with itself produces modes whose indices $m_s=m_1+m_2$ (with $m_1, m_2 \\in S_N$) can range from $(-N/2)+(-N/2)=-N$ to $(N/2-1)+(N/2-1) = N-2$.\nWhen we pad to a grid of size $M=3N/2$, calculation is performed using circular convolution modulo $M$. The uniquely represented modes on this grid are $|m|  M/2 = 3N/4$. Any generated mode $m_s$ with $|m_s| \\ge M/2$ will be aliased. We need to check if any such alias can fall into the original retained band, $|m| \\le N/2-1$.\nConsider a sum-frequency $m_s$ where $M/2 \\le |m_s| \\le N$. The alias is $m_a = m_s \\pmod M$.\n- For the maximum positive sum, $m_s = N-2$. Its alias is $m_a = (N-2)-M = (N-2) - 3N/2 = -N/2-2$.\n- For the minimum negative sum, $m_s = -N$. Its alias is $m_a = -N+M = -N+3N/2 = N/2$.\nThe range of aliases is therefore bounded. The aliased mode $m_a = N/2$ falls outside the specified retained band $|m| \\le N/2-1$. The other alias, $m_a = -N/2-2$, also has an absolute value greater than $N/2-1$. For any $m_s$ between these extremes, e.g., $m_s=M/2 = 3N/4$, its alias is $m_a = 3N/4 - M = -3N/4$, whose magnitude is larger than $N/2-1$.\nThus, all aliased energy from the quadratic interaction is mapped to modes with magnitude $|m_a| \\ge N/2$. Since the retained band is strictly $|m| \\le N/2-1$, padding to $M=3N/2$ successfully prevents contamination of this band.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Padding to $M = 4 N / 3$ points is sufficient and minimal for de-aliasing all quadratic interactions of modes initially retained in $|m| \\le N/2 - 1$.**\n\nLet us test this padding factor. Here, $M = 4N/3$. The uniquely represented modes on the padded grid have indices $|m|  M/2 = 2N/3$. The highest frequency generated by the quadratic product is close to $N-2$, which is greater than $2N/3$ (for $N6$). Let's take a representative mode sum $m_s \\approx N-2$. Its alias will be $m_a = (N-2)-M = (N-2) - 4N/3 = -N/3 - 2$. The magnitude is $|m_a| = N/3+2$. For $N \\ge 18$, $N/3+2  N/2-1$, so this alias falls *inside* the retained band $|m|\\le N/2-1$. For instance, take $N=24$. The retained band is $|m|\\le 11$. The padding is to $M=32$. The alias of $m_s=22$ is $22-32=-10$. This falls in the retained band. Therefore, padding to $M=4N/3$ is insufficient. The minimal sufficient padding is described by the 3/2 rule. The 4/3-rule is related to de-aliasing cubic, not quadratic, nonlinearities.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. If $m_0 \\le N/4$, then even without any de-aliasing, the computed amplitude of the $2 k_0$ harmonic in $p^2$ is exact for all $N$ because the second harmonic lies within the representable band.**\n\nThe initial condition $p(x,0) = A \\cos(k_0 x)$ has spectral components only at $m=\\pm m_0$. The quadratic product $p^2$ generates components at $m = (\\pm m_0) + (\\pm m_0)$, which are $m=0, \\pm 2m_0$.\nThe problem is with aliasing in the circular convolution. The computed coefficient for mode $2m_0$ is $\\hat{q}_{2m_0} = \\sum_{l+j \\equiv 2m_0 \\pmod N} \\hat{p}_l \\hat{p}_j$. The only non-zero terms are when $l,j \\in \\{-m_0, m_0\\}$.\n- The desired term is for $(l,j)=(m_0,m_0)$, where $l+j = 2m_0$.\n- An aliasing term could arise if another combination also sums to $2m_0 \\pmod N$. For example, if $(l,j)=(-m_0, -m_0)$, giving $l+j = -2m_0$. Aliasing occurs if $-2m_0 \\equiv 2m_0 \\pmod N$, which means $4m_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod N$, or $4m_0 = k N$ for some non-zero integer $k$.\nThe statement condition is $m_0 \\le N/4$. This allows for the case $m_0 = N/4$ (if $N$ is a multiple of $4$). In this case, $4m_0=N$, so $k=1$. This means $-2m_0 = -N/2$ aliases to $2m_0 = N/2$ (since $-N/2 \\equiv N/2 \\pmod N$).\nThe computed coefficient for the second harmonic at $m=2m_0=N/2$ would be:\n$$ \\hat{q}_{N/2} = \\hat{p}_{m_0}\\hat{p}_{m_0} + \\hat{p}_{-m_0}\\hat{p}_{-m_0} = (A/2)^2 + (A/2)^2 = A^2/2 $$\nThe true, analytical coefficient is $\\hat{q}_{2m_0} = A^2/4$. The computed amplitude is doubled due to aliasing.\nBecause the statement includes the equality $m_0 \\le N/4$, it is false. It is only true for the strict inequality $m_0  N/4$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Alternatively, performing the $2/3$-rule truncation on the original $N$-point grid—i.e., zeroing all Fourier coefficients with $|m| \\ge N/3$ prior to computing $p^2$ pointwise—prevents aliasing of the quadratic nonlinearity into the retained band.**\n\nThis statement describes the truncation or \"2/3 rule\" for de-aliasing. First, the spectrum is filtered, setting $\\hat{p}_m=0$ for all $|m| \\ge N/3$. Let this filtered spectrum be $\\hat{p}'$. The non-zero modes are in the band $|m|  N/3$. The convolution of $\\hat{p}'$ with itself will generate modes $m_s=m_1+m_2$ where $|m_1|,|m_2|N/3$. The sum-frequencies are therefore in the range $|m_s|  2N/3$.\nWe are interested in the accuracy of the computed coefficients $\\hat{q}'_m$ for the \"retained band\", which in this context is the same band we kept, $|m|  N/3$. An aliasing error would occur if $m_s = m_1+m_2$ had an alias that falls in this band. This would require $m_s = m + k N$ for $|m|N/3$ and some non-zero integer $k$.\nThen $k N = m_s - m$. Taking the magnitude, $|k|N = |m_s - m| \\le |m_s| + |m|  2N/3 + N/3 = N$.\nSo $|k|N  N$. For any non-zero integer $k$, this is impossible. The only possibility is $k=0$, which means $m_s=m$ and there is no aliasing. The circular convolution exactly computes the linear convolution for all result modes in the band $|m|2N/3$. Since we only care about retaining the band $|m|N/3$, this method works perfectly.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**",
