            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in classical acoustics and aeroacoustics. The premises are physically coherent, and the required data and conditions are provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is objective and uses standard terminology and assumptions within the field.\n\nThe problem asks for the acoustic pressure radiated by a pulsating sphere, derived from the thickness term of the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (FW–H) analogy. The FW–H equation is an exact rearrangement of the conservation of mass and momentum into an inhomogeneous wave equation. The general solution for the acoustic pressure perturbation $p'(\\mathbf{x}, t) = p(\\mathbf{x}, t) - p_0$ is given by a sum of three integral terms, representing thickness (monopole), loading (dipole), and quadrupole sources.\n\nWe are instructed to use only the thickness term, which accounts for the displacement of fluid by the motion of the surface. For an observer at position $\\mathbf{x}$ at time $t$, this term is given by:\n$$\np'_{T}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{S} \\left[ \\frac{\\rho_0 v_n}{r_s |1 - M_r|} \\right]_{\\tau} dS(\\mathbf{y})\n$$\nHere, $S$ is the surface of the body, $\\mathbf{y}$ is a point on the surface, $v_n$ is the local surface velocity normal to the surface (defined positive outwards), $\\rho_0$ is the ambient fluid density, $r_s = |\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}|$ is the distance from a source point to the observer, $M_r$ is the Mach number of the surface in the direction of the observer, and the notation $[\\cdot]_{\\tau}$ indicates that the quantity in the brackets is evaluated at the retarded time $\\tau = t - r_s/c_0$, where $c_0$ is the speed of sound.\n\nThe problem states several simplifying conditions:\n1.  The fluid is quiescent, meaning there is no background flow, so the sphere's surface motion relative to the fluid is its absolute motion. The sphere is not translating, so its surface Mach number $M_r$ is zero.\n2.  The observer is in the far field, so $r \\gg a$, where $r$ is the distance from the center of the sphere to the observer. This allows the approximation $r_s = |\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}| \\approx r$. We can therefore move the $1/r_s$ factor outside the integral as $1/r$.\n3.  The sphere is acoustically compact ($ka \\ll 1$, where $k = \\omega/c_0$). This justifies approximating the retarded time for all points on the surface with a single value based on the sphere's center: $\\tau = t - r/c_0$.\n\nApplying these simplifications, the thickness term reduces to:\n$$\np'(r, t) \\approx \\frac{1}{4\\pi r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{S} \\left[ \\rho_0 v_n \\right]_{\\tau} dS(\\mathbf{y})\n$$\nwhere $\\tau = t - r/c_0$.\n\nThe sphere undergoes spatially uniform, radial pulsations described by the surface displacement $\\xi(t) = \\xi_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$. The surface velocity $v_n$ is the time derivative of this displacement:\n$$\nv_n(t) = \\frac{d\\xi}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\xi_0 \\sin(\\omega t)) = \\xi_0 \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nSince the pulsations are uniform, $v_n$ is constant over the entire surface $S$ at any given instant. We can take it and the constant ambient density $\\rho_0$ out of the integral:\n$$\np'(r, t) \\approx \\frac{\\rho_0}{4\\pi r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ v_n(t) \\right]_{\\tau} \\int_{S} dS\n$$\nThe integral is the surface area of the sphere, which is $4\\pi a^2$.\n$$\np'(r, t) \\approx \\frac{\\rho_0 (4\\pi a^2)}{4\\pi r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ v_n(t) \\right]_{\\tau} = \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} v_n(\\tau)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_n$ and evaluating at the retarded time $\\tau = t - r/c_0$:\n$$\np'(r, t) = \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left( \\xi_0 \\omega \\cos(\\omega(t - r/c_0)) \\right)\n$$\nPerforming the time differentiation using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left( \\xi_0 \\omega \\cos(\\omega(t - r/c_0)) \\right) = \\xi_0 \\omega \\left( -\\sin(\\omega(t - r/c_0)) \\cdot \\omega \\right) = -\\xi_0 \\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega(t - r/c_0))\n$$\nSubstituting this back gives the final expression for the acoustic pressure:\n$$\np'(r, t) = \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2}{r} \\left( -\\xi_0 \\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega(t - r/c_0)) \\right) = - \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega^2}{r} \\sin\\left(\\omega \\left(t - \\frac{r}{c_0}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThe problem next asks to compare this expression to the classic compact-monopole solution. A compact pulsating sphere is the canonical example of an acoustic monopole, or simple source. The acoustic field of a simple source can be described by a velocity potential $\\phi$ that produces a spherically symmetric, outgoing wave, $\\phi(r,t) = f(t-r/c_0)/r$. The acoustic pressure is $p' = \\rho_0 \\partial \\phi / \\partial t$ and the radial velocity is $u_r = -\\partial \\phi / \\partial r$.\n\nThe boundary condition is that the fluid velocity at the sphere's surface matches the surface velocity: $u_r(a,t) = v_n(t)$. For a compact source ($ka \\ll 1$), the near-field term in the velocity expression dominates, so $u_r(a,t) \\approx f(t)/a^2$.\nThus, $f(t) \\approx a^2 v_n(t) = a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)$.\nThe far-field pressure is given by:\n$$\np'(r,t) = \\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{r} f'(t-r/c_0)\n$$\nWe find $f'(t)$ by differentiating $f(t)$:\n$$\nf'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)) = -a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nEvaluating this at the retarded time gives:\n$$\np'(r,t) = \\frac{\\rho_0}{r} \\left( -a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega(t-r/c_0)) \\right) = - \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega^2}{r} \\sin\\left(\\omega \\left(t - \\frac{r}{c_0}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis result is identical to the one obtained from the FW–H thickness term. Therefore, the thickness term of the FW–H analogy, when applied to a compact pulsating body, correctly reproduces the classic compact-monopole solution. They do coincide. The radiated pressure is proportional to the surface acceleration, hence the $-\\sin$ dependence, which is $90^\\circ$ out of phase with the velocity ($\\cos$).\nThe retarded time is $\\tau = t - r/c_0$.\n\nThe final expression for the acoustic pressure is:\n$$\np'(r, t) = - \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega^2}{r} \\sin\\left(\\omega \\left(t - \\frac{r}{c_0}\\right)\\right)\n$$",

The acoustic field at a fixed observer location $\\boldsymbol{x}$ in the far field is modeled using the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (FW-H) acoustic analogy (Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings, FW-H). The airfoil experiences a spatially uniform, time-harmonic lift (normal surface loading) whose surface integral (the net aerodynamic force along the observer’s line of sight) is given by $F(t) = F_{0} \\cos(\\omega t)$, where $F_{0}  0$ and $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ with $f$ the forcing frequency.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of contradictions. All necessary parameters and simplifying assumptions are provided to derive a unique solution based on established principles of aeroacoustics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution follows.\n\nThe acoustic pressure fluctuation $p'(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$ in the far field of a low Mach number flow is given by the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (FW-H) acoustic analogy. The solution to the FW-H equation can be expressed as a sum of three terms, representing thickness (monopole), loading (dipole), and quadrupole sources. The problem specifies a stationary airfoil ($v_n=0$) and asks for the contribution from the loading (surface) term only. For a stationary body, the thickness noise is zero, and for low Mach number flows where sound is generated by surface forces, the volume-based quadrupole term is typically negligible compared to the loading term.\n\nThe loading term contribution to the acoustic pressure in the far field is given by the integral:\n$$p'(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\int_S \\left[ \\frac{l_i}{r|1-M_r|} \\right]_{\\tau} dS(\\boldsymbol{y})$$\nHere, $l_i = (p-p_0) n_i$ is the force per unit area exerted by the surface on the fluid, where $n_i$ is the outward normal vector from the fluid region. The subscript $\\tau$ indicates that the integrand is evaluated at the retarded time $\\tau = t - |\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y}|/c$. The term $M_r$ is the Mach number of the source in the direction of the observer.\n\nWe apply the simplifying conditions given in the problem:\n1.  **Stationary airfoil**: The source surface is stationary, so the Mach number $M_r = 0$. The denominator $|1-M_r|$ becomes $1$.\n2.  **Far-field observer**: For an observer far from the source, the spatial derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}$ can be approximated by a time derivative: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\approx -\\frac{\\hat{r}_i}{c} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$, where $\\hat{r}_i = (x_i-y_i)/r$ is the component of the unit vector pointing from the source element at $\\boldsymbol{y}$ to the observer at $\\boldsymbol{x}$.\n3.  **Acoustically compact body**: The source is small compared to the acoustic wavelength. This allows us to approximate the distance $r = |\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y}|$ as a constant value $r$ (the distance from the observer to the body's center) for all source points $\\boldsymbol{y}$ on the surface $S$. Consequently, the retarded time $\\tau = t - r/c$ is also constant over the source region, and the unit vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}}$ is constant.\n\nApplying these simplifications to the loading integral:\n$$p'(\\boldsymbol{x},t) \\approx \\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\left(-\\frac{\\hat{r}_i}{c} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right) \\int_S \\left[ \\frac{l_i(\\boldsymbol{y}, \\tau)}{r} \\right] dS(\\boldsymbol{y})$$\nDue to compactness, $r$ and $\\hat{r}_i$ can be moved outside the integral:\n$$p'(\\boldsymbol{x},t) \\approx -\\frac{1}{4 \\pi c r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_S \\hat{r}_i [l_i(\\boldsymbol{y}, \\tau)] dS(\\boldsymbol{y}) = -\\frac{1}{4 \\pi c r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ \\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}} \\cdot \\int_S \\boldsymbol{l}(\\boldsymbol{y}, \\tau) dS(\\boldsymbol{y}) \\right]$$\nThe integral $\\int_S \\boldsymbol{l}(\\boldsymbol{y}, \\tau) dS$ is the net force exerted by the body on the fluid, $\\boldsymbol{F}_\\text{fluid}(\\tau)$. By Newton's third law, this is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the aerodynamic force exerted by the fluid on the body, $\\boldsymbol{F}_\\text{body}(\\tau)$, which includes lift.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of computational aeroacoustics, well-posed with a clear objective, and free from subjective or ambiguous language. It presents a standard, non-trivial problem in the numerical implementation of the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (FW-H) acoustic analogy.\n\nThe solution proceeds by deriving the discretization requirement from first principles.\n\nThe radiated acoustic pressure $p'$ at an observer location $\\mathbf{x}$ and angular frequency $\\omega$ is computed via the FW-H integral over a control surface $S$. The integral involves a Green's function, which for the Helmholtz equation (the frequency-domain counterpart of the wave equation) in a free field is given by:\n$$\nG(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}, \\omega) = \\frac{e^{-ikR}}{4\\pi R}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{y}$ is a source point on the surface $S$, $R = |\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}|$ is the distance between the source and observer, and $k = \\omega/c$ is the acoustic wavenumber. The term $e^{-ikR}$ is the oscillatory kernel mentioned in the problem.\n\nThe problem states the observer is in the acoustic far field, so $\\mathbf{x} = r\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ with $r \\rightarrow \\infty$.

The spatial variation of the phase across the source surface is entirely governed by the term $e^{ik\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\mathbf{y}}$. The phase angle is $\\phi(\\mathbf{y}) = k\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\mathbf{y}$.\n\nWe now consider a single flat panel of characteristic size $h$. The source terms are assumed to be piecewise-constant, meaning the integral over the panel approximates the integrand using its value at a single point (e.g., the centroid). This approximation is accurate only if the integrand does not vary significantly over the panel. The most rapid variation comes from the phase term $\\phi(\\mathbf{y})$.\n\nTo quantify this variation, we examine the gradient of the phase with respect to the surface coordinate $\\mathbf{y}$:\n$$\n\\nabla_y \\phi(\\mathbf{y}) = k\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nThe change in phase along a specific direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$ on the surface is given by the directional derivative $(\\nabla_y \\phi) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{d}} = k \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$. Since the panel is locally flat, any direction on the panel is a tangent direction, which we denote by $\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}$. The rate of phase change across the panel is maximized in the tangent direction most aligned with the observer vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$. This rate defines a spatial frequency on the surface.\n\nThe phase term $e^{ik\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\mathbf{y}}$ represents a plane wave with wave vector $k\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$. When this wave impinges on the surface, it creates a pattern of phase variation. The wavelength of this pattern along a tangent direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\lambda_s = \\frac{2\\pi}{|k\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}|} = \\frac{\\lambda}{|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}|}\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k$ is the acoustic wavelength in free space. This projected wavelength $\\lambda_s$ is the characteristic length scale of the oscillation that the numerical grid must resolve.\n\nInsufficient panel resolution, i.e., $h$ being too large compared to $\\lambda_s$, leads to spatial aliasing. According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, to prevent aliasing, the sampling interval (here, the panel size $h$) must be no more than half of the shortest wavelength present in the signal. This gives the condition:\n$$\nh \\le \\frac{\\lambda_s}{2} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}|}\n$$\nThis criterion must hold for the worst-case scenario, which involves the tangent direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}$ and observer direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ that maximize the spatial frequency (i.e., minimize $\\lambda_s$). Rearranging the inequality, we get:\n$$\n2h|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}| \\le \\lambda\n$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k$, we have:\n$$\n2h|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}| \\le \\frac{2\\pi}{k} \\implies k h |\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}| \\le \\pi\n$$\nThis condition ensures that the phase does not change by more than $\\pi$ over the length of a panel in any direction, preventing the numerical integration from misinterpreting the wave cycle. This preserves the spectral content of the signal, ensuring spectral fidelity.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\nA. $k\\,h\\,\\left|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{t}}\\right| \\le \\pi$ for all panels and observation directions, equivalently $h\\,\\left|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{t}}\\right| \\le \\lambda/2$.\nThis condition is precisely the Nyquist criterion derived above. It correctly identifies that the relevant length scale for resolution is the panel size $h$, the relevant wavenumber is the acoustic wavenumber $k$, and the geometric scaling factor is the projection $|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}|$. The equivalence $kh|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}| \\le \\pi \\iff h|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}| \\le \\lambda/2$ is a direct consequence of the definition $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$. This condition correctly captures the physics required to avoid spatial aliasing.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. $h \\le \\lambda$ is sufficient; the oscillatory kernel is fully resolved once the panel size does not exceed one acoustic wavelength.\nThis statement is incorrect on two fundamental grounds. First, the Nyquist criterion requires at least two samples per wavelength, which implies a resolution condition of $h \\le \\lambda_{\\text{effective}}/2$, not $h \\le \\lambda_{\\text{effective}}$. Second, it completely neglects the projection effect, i.e., the fact that the relevant wavelength is the one projected onto the surface, $\\lambda_s = \\lambda/|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}|$. This makes the condition far too permissive and physically incomplete.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. $h \\le \\dfrac{\\lambda}{2\\left(1 - \\mathbf{M}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\right)}$; the allowable panel size grows as the observation alignment with the motion strengthens due to Doppler stretching.\nThis option introduces the Doppler factor, $1 - \\mathbf{M}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$, which arises from source motion. For a moving source, the effective wavenumber in the far-field integral kernel is scaled by this factor. The phase term becomes approximately $e^{i k (\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\mathbf{y})/(1-\\mathbf{M}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{r}})}$. The spatial wavenumber on the surface would be $k_s = \\frac{k}{1-\\mathbf{M}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}|$. A proper criterion including motion effects would be $h \\le \\frac{\\lambda_s}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{k_s} = \\frac{\\pi (1-\\mathbf{M}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{r}})}{k|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}|} = \\frac{\\lambda(1-\\mathbf{M}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{r}})}{2|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}|}$.\nThe proposed condition in option C is flawed in two ways. First, it completely omits the crucial geometric projection factor $|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}|$. Second, its physical explanation is reversed. When the source moves towards the observer, $\\mathbf{M}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}  0$, the observed frequency is blueshifted (higher frequency, shorter wavelength). This requires a *finer* mesh (smaller $h$), not a coarser one. The option incorrectly suggests the allowable panel size grows (Doppler stretching), which is the opposite of the physical effect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. $h \\le \\lambda/2$ enforced only in the surface-normal direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$, because the phase variation is dominated by changes in normal separation.\nThis option's reasoning is fundamentally flawed. The phase variation that must be resolved occurs *across the panel*, i.e., in directions tangent to the surface. A displacement $\\Delta\\mathbf{y}$ on the panel is, by definition, orthogonal to the normal vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$. The phase change is $\\Delta\\phi = k\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\Delta\\mathbf{y}$. As $\\Delta\\mathbf{y}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = 0$, the component of $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ normal to the surface, $(\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$, contributes nothing to the phase variation on the panel. The variation is driven exclusively by the projection of $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ onto the tangent plane. The claim that phase variation is dominated by \"changes in normal separation\" is physically incorrect in this context.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
