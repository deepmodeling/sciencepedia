While often treated as a simple constant, its value is fundamentally tied to the thermodynamic process governing the acoustic compressions and rarefactions. This exercise challenges you to derive the sound speed from first principles for an ideal gas under two different physical assumptions—isothermal and isentropic—and to quantify their difference, revealing why the isentropic assumption is standard for acoustics.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, based on fundamental principles of thermodynamics and acoustics.\n\nThe squared speed of sound, $c^2$, is generally defined as the partial derivative of pressure, $p$, with respect to density, $\\rho$, under a specific thermodynamic constraint. For small perturbations $p'$ and $\\rho'$ about an equilibrium state $(p_0, \\rho_0)$, the linear relationship is $p' = c^2 \\rho'$, where $c^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\rho}\\right)_{\\text{constraint}}$. We will evaluate this for two distinct constraints: isothermal and isentropic.\n\nFirst, we derive the squared sound speed for isothermal perturbations. In this case, the temperature $T$ is held constant, so the constraint is $T = T_0$. The governing thermodynamic relation is the ideal gas law:\n$$p = \\rho R T$$\nwhere $R$ is the specific gas constant. To find the isothermal sound speed, $c_{\\text{isothermal}}$, we calculate the partial derivative of $p$ with respect to $\\rho$ at constant $T$:\n$$c_{\\text{isothermal}}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\rho}\\right)_{T} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\rho R T)}{\\partial \\rho}\\right)_{T}$$\nSince both $R$ and $T$ are held constant for this differentiation, we obtain:\n$$c_{\\text{isothermal}}^{2} = R T$$\nEvaluating this at the equilibrium temperature $T_0$, we have:\n$$c_{\\text{isothermal}}^{2} = R T_0$$\nUsing the ideal gas law at the equilibrium state, $p_0 = \\rho_0 R T_0$, this can also be expressed as $c_{\\text{isothermal}}^{2} = p_0 / \\rho_0$.\n\nNext, we derive the squared sound speed for isentropic perturbations. In this case, the specific entropy $s$ is held constant. We must first establish the relationship between pressure and density for an ideal gas during an isentropic process. We start from the Gibbs equation (a combination of the first and second laws of thermodynamics) in terms of specific enthalpy $h$:\n$$T ds = dh - v dp$$\nwhere $v = 1/\\rho$ is the specific volume. For an ideal gas, the differential of specific enthalpy is $dh = c_p dT$, where $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure. Substituting this and the ideal gas relation $v = RT/p$ into the Gibbs equation gives:\n$$T ds = c_p dT - \\frac{RT}{p} dp$$\nDividing by $T$ yields a differential expression for entropy:\n$$ds = c_p \\frac{dT}{T} - R \\frac{dp}{p}$$\nFor an isentropic process, $ds = 0$, so we have:\n$$c_p \\frac{dT}{T} = R \\frac{dp}{p}$$\nTo relate $p$ and $\\rho$, we use the logarithmic differential of the ideal gas law, $p = \\rho R T$:\n$$\\ln(p) = \\ln(\\rho) + \\ln(R) + \\ln(T)$$\n$$ \\frac{dp}{p} = \\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho} + \\frac{dT}{T}$$\nFrom this, we can express $dT/T$ as $\\frac{dT}{T} = \\frac{dp}{p} - \\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho}$. Substituting this into the isentropic condition $c_p \\frac{dT}{T} = R \\frac{dp}{p}$:\n$$c_p \\left(\\frac{dp}{p} - \\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho}\\right) = R \\frac{dp}{p}$$\nRearranging the terms to group $dp$ and $d\\rho$:\n$$(c_p - R) \\frac{dp}{p} = c_p \\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho}$$\nUsing Mayer's relation for an ideal gas, $R = c_p - c_v$, we find that $c_p - R = c_v$, where $c_v$ is the specific heat at constant volume. The equation simplifies to:\n$$c_v \\frac{dp}{p} = c_p \\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho}$$\n$$\\frac{dp}{p} = \\frac{c_p}{c_v} \\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho}$$\nBy definition, the ratio of specific heats is $\\gamma = c_p/c_v$. Thus, for an isentropic process:\n$$\\frac{dp}{p} = \\gamma \\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho}$$\nIntegrating this differential equation from an initial state $(p_0, \\rho_0)$ to a final state $(p, \\rho)$ yields $\\ln(p/p_0) = \\gamma \\ln(\\rho/\\rho_0)$, which gives the well-known isentropic relation for an ideal gas:\n$$p \\rho^{-\\gamma} = p_0 \\rho_0^{-\\gamma} = \\text{constant}$$\nNow we can compute the isentropic sound speed, $c_{\\text{isentropic}}$, by taking the derivative of $p = (p_0 \\rho_0^{-\\gamma}) \\rho^\\gamma$ with respect to $\\rho$:\n$$c_{\\text{isentropic}}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\rho}\\right)_{s} = (p_0 \\rho_0^{-\\gamma}) \\frac{d}{d\\rho}(\\rho^\\gamma) = (p_0 \\rho_0^{-\\gamma}) \\gamma \\rho^{\\gamma-1}$$\nEvaluating this at the equilibrium state $(\\rho = \\rho_0)$:\n$$c_{\\text{isentropic}}^{2} = (p_0 \\rho_0^{-\\gamma}) \\gamma \\rho_0^{\\gamma-1} = \\gamma \\frac{p_0}{\\rho_0}$$\nUsing the equilibrium ideal gas law again, $p_0/\\rho_0 = R T_0$, we can also write this as:\n$$c_{\\text{isentropic}}^{2} = \\gamma R T_0$$\nNow we can compute the fractional difference, $\\Delta$. We have the two expressions for the squared sound speeds:\n$$c_{\\text{isothermal}}^{2} = R T_0$$\n$$c_{\\text{isentropic}}^{2} = \\gamma R T_0$$\nThe fractional difference $\\Delta$ is defined as:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{c_{\\text{isentropic}}^{2} - c_{\\text{isothermal}}^{2}}{c_{\\text{isothermal}}^{2}}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{\\gamma R T_0 - R T_0}{R T_0} = \\frac{R T_0 (\\gamma - 1)}{R T_0}$$\nThe term $R T_0$ cancels, leaving the final expression for $\\Delta$ solely in terms of $\\gamma$:\n$$\\Delta = \\gamma - 1$$",

This method involves substituting a single Fourier mode into the discrete equation and determining the conditions under which the amplitude of this mode does not grow in time.\n\nA general solution $p_{\\mathbf{j}}^{n}$ can be expressed as a superposition of Fourier modes. Due to the linearity of the scheme, we only need to analyze a single mode of the form:\n$$\np_{\\mathbf{j}}^{n} = G^{n}(\\mathbf{k}) \\exp(i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathbf{j}})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{k} = (k_1, \\dots, k_d)$ is the wavevector, $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathbf{j}} = (j_1 \\Delta x_1, \\dots, j_d \\Delta x_d)$ is the position vector of the grid node $\\mathbf{j}$, and $G(\\mathbf{k})$ is the amplification factor for the mode with wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$. For simplicity, $G$ is written instead of $G(\\mathbf{k})$. The stability of the scheme requires that $|G| \\leq 1$ for all possible wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$.\n\nLet's define the non-dimensional wavenumber components as $\\xi_i = k_i \\Delta x_i$. The dot product in the exponential becomes $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathbf{j}} = \\sum_{l=1}^{d} k_l j_l \\Delta x_l = \\sum_{l=1}^{d} j_l \\xi_l$.\nThe spatial-shift terms can be written as:\n$$\np_{\\mathbf{j}+\\mathbf{e}_{i}}^{n} = G^{n} \\exp\\left(i \\left( \\sum_{l=1}^{d} j_l \\xi_l + \\xi_i \\right) \\right) = p_{\\mathbf{j}}^{n} \\exp(i\\xi_i)\n$$\n$$\np_{\\mathbf{j}-\\mathbf{e}_{i}}^{n} = G^{n} \\exp\\left(i \\left( \\sum_{l=1}^{d} j_l \\xi_l - \\xi_i \\right) \\right) = p_{\\mathbf{j}}^{n} \\exp(-i\\xi_i)\n$$\nSubstituting the Fourier mode ansatz into the finite-difference scheme:\n$$\n\\frac{G^{n+1}p_{\\mathbf{j}}^{0} - 2G^{n}p_{\\mathbf{j}}^{0} + G^{n-1}p_{\\mathbf{j}}^{0}}{\\Delta t^{2}} = c^{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{G^{n}p_{\\mathbf{j}}^{0}(\\exp(i\\xi_i) - 2 + \\exp(-i\\xi_i))}{\\Delta x_{i}^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $p_{\\mathbf{j}}^{0} = \\exp(i\\sum_l j_l \\xi_l)$. We can divide out the common, non-zero factor $G^{n-1}p_{\\mathbf{j}}^{0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{G^{2} - 2G + 1}{\\Delta t^{2}} = G \\left( c^{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{\\exp(i\\xi_i) - 2 + \\exp(-i\\xi_i)}{\\Delta x_{i}^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the identity $2\\cos(\\theta) = \\exp(i\\theta) + \\exp(-i\\theta)$, the term in the parenthesis becomes $2\\cos(\\xi_i) - 2$. We can further simplify this using the half-angle identity $1-\\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^{2}(\\theta/2)$, which gives $2\\cos(\\xi_i) - 2 = -4\\sin^{2}(\\xi_i/2)$.\nSubstituting this back into the equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{(G-1)^{2}}{\\Delta t^{2}} = G \\left( c^{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{-4\\sin^{2}(\\xi_i/2)}{\\Delta x_{i}^{2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n(G-1)^{2} = -G \\left( 4c^{2}\\Delta t^{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{\\sin^{2}(\\xi_i/2)}{\\Delta x_{i}^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nLet us define the non-negative real quantity $A$ as:\n$$\nA = 4c^{2}\\Delta t^{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{\\sin^{2}(\\xi_i/2)}{\\Delta x_{i}^{2}}\n$$\nThe equation for the amplification factor $G$ becomes:\n$$\n(G-1)^{2} = -AG\n$$\n$$\nG^{2} - 2G + 1 = -AG\n$$\n$$\nG^{2} + (A-2)G + 1 = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $G$. The roots are given by:\n$$\nG = \\frac{-(A-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(A-2)^{2} - 4}}{2}\n$$\nThe stability condition $|G| \\leq 1$ must hold for both roots.\n\nWe analyze the roots based on the value of the discriminant, $(A-2)^{2} - 4$.\nCase 1: $(A-2)^{2} - 4 < 0$. This corresponds to $0 < A < 4$.\nIn this case, the roots are a complex conjugate pair:\n$$\nG = \\frac{2-A \\pm i\\sqrt{4 - (A-2)^{2}}}{2}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the roots is:\n$$\n|G|^{2} = \\left(\\frac{2-A}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{4 - (A-2)^{2}}}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{(2-A)^{2} + 4 - (A-2)^{2}}{4} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1\n$$\nSo, for $0 < A < 4$, we have $|G|=1$. The scheme is stable.\n\nCase 2: $(A-2)^{2} - 4 \\geq 0$. Since $A \\geq 0$, this condition is satisfied for $A \\geq 4$ or $A=0$.\nIf $A=0$ (the trivial case of zero wavenumber), the equation becomes $(G-1)^2=0$, giving $G=1$, which is stable.\nIf $A=4$, the equation becomes $(G+1)^2=0$, giving $G=-1$, so $|G|=1$, which is stable.\nIf $A > 4$, the discriminant is positive, and the roots are real and distinct. The product of the roots, from Vieta's formulas for $G^{2} + (A-2)G + 1 = 0$, is $G_1 G_2 = 1$. If the roots are real and their product is $1$, one root must have a magnitude greater than $1$ (unless both are $\\pm 1$, which only happens for $A=0$ or $A=4$). Therefore, for $A > 4$, the scheme is unstable.\n\nCombining the cases, the necessary and sufficient condition for stability is $A \\leq 4$.\nThis condition must hold for all possible wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$, which means it must hold for the maximum possible value of $A$. The maximum value of $A$ occurs when the term $\\sin^{2}(\\xi_i/2) = \\sin^{2}(k_i \\Delta x_i/2)$ is maximized for all $i$. The maximum value of $\\sin^{2}(\\theta)$ is $1$. This occurs for the highest frequency modes resolvable by the grid (the Nyquist frequency, where $k_i \\Delta x_i = \\pi$).\nThus, the most stringent condition is:\n$$\nA_{\\max} = 4c^{2}\\Delta t^{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{1}{\\Delta x_{i}^{2}} \\leq 4\n$$\nSolving this inequality for $\\Delta t$:\n$$\nc^{2}\\Delta t^{2} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{1}{\\Delta x_{i}^{2}} \\right) \\leq 1\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t^{2} \\leq \\frac{1}{c^{2} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{1}{\\Delta x_{i}^{2}} \\right)}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t \\leq \\frac{1}{c \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{1}{\\Delta x_{i}^{2}}}}\n$$\nThe maximum allowable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, is the upper bound of this inequality, known as the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition for this scheme.

I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Numerical Phase Velocity\n\nThe starting point is the provided finite-difference approximation of the 1-D wave equation:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{i}^{n+1} - 2 p_{i}^{n} + p_{i}^{n-1}}{\\Delta t^{2}} = c^{2} \\frac{p_{i+1}^{n} - 2 p_{i}^{n} + p_{i-1}^{n}}{\\Delta x^{2}}\n$$\nWe perform a von Neumann Fourier analysis by substituting the discrete plane-wave ansatz $p_{i}^{n} = \\hat{p} \\exp\\!\\big(\\mathrm{i}(k x_i - \\omega t_n)\\big)$, where $x_i = i \\Delta x$ and $t_n = n \\Delta t$.\nThe different terms in the finite-difference equation can be expressed as:\n-   $p_{i}^{n} = \\hat{p} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}(k i \\Delta x - \\omega n \\Delta t))$\n-   $p_{i}^{n+1} = \\hat{p} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}(k i \\Delta x - \\omega (n+1) \\Delta t)) = p_{i}^{n} \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\omega \\Delta t)$\n-   $p_{i}^{n-1} = \\hat{p} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}(k i \\Delta x - \\omega (n-1) \\Delta t)) = p_{i}^{n} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\omega \\Delta t)$\n-   $p_{i+1}^{n} = \\hat{p} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}(k (i+1) \\Delta x - \\omega n \\Delta t)) = p_{i}^{n} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}k \\Delta x)$\n-   $p_{i-1}^{n} = \\hat{p} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}(k (i-1) \\Delta x - \\omega n \\Delta t)) = p_{i}^{n} \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}k \\Delta x)$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the finite-difference equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{i}^{n} \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\omega \\Delta t) - 2 p_{i}^{n} + p_{i}^{n} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\omega \\Delta t)}{\\Delta t^{2}} = c^{2} \\frac{p_{i}^{n} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}k \\Delta x) - 2 p_{i}^{n} + p_{i}^{n} \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}k \\Delta x)}{\\Delta x^{2}}\n$$\nAssuming a non-trivial solution ($p_{i}^{n} \\neq 0$), we can divide through by $p_{i}^{n}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\omega \\Delta t) + \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\omega \\Delta t) - 2}{\\Delta t^{2}} = c^{2} \\frac{\\exp(\\mathrm{i}k \\Delta x) + \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}k \\Delta x) - 2}{\\Delta x^{2}}\n$$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\theta) + \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\theta)}{2}$, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\cos(\\omega \\Delta t) - 2}{\\Delta t^{2}} = c^{2} \\frac{2\\cos(k \\Delta x) - 2}{\\Delta x^{2}}\n$$\nWe apply the trigonometric half-angle identity $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\frac{\\theta}{2})$, which implies $2\\cos(\\theta) - 2 = -4\\sin^2(\\frac{\\theta}{2})$.\nSubstituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{-4 \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right)}{\\Delta t^{2}} = c^{2} \\frac{-4 \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)}{\\Delta x^{2}}\n$$\nCanceling the factor of $-4$ from both sides, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right)}{\\Delta t^{2}} = c^{2} \\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)}{\\Delta x^{2}}\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides, and assuming $\\omega$ and $k$ are positive for a forward-propagating wave, the arguments of the sine functions will be in a range where sine is positive, so we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right)}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{c}{\\Delta x} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the numerical dispersion relation. Now, we introduce the specified nondimensional parameters: the CFL number $\\sigma = \\dfrac{c \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$ and the nondimensional wavenumber $\\kappa = k \\Delta x$.\nMultiplying the equation by $\\Delta t$, we have:\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right) = \\frac{c \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) = \\sigma \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\right)\n$$\nWe now solve for the angular frequency $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2} = \\arcsin\\left(\\sigma \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{2}{\\Delta t} \\arcsin\\left(\\sigma \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe numerical phase velocity is defined as $v_{p} = \\dfrac{\\omega}{k}$. Substituting the expression for $\\omega$:\n$$\nv_{p} = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{\\Delta t} \\arcsin\\left(\\sigma \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\right)\\right) \\right) = \\frac{2}{k \\Delta t} \\arcsin\\left(\\sigma \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the numerical phase velocity to the physical sound speed, $\\dfrac{v_{p}}{c}$:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{p}}{c} = \\frac{2}{c k \\Delta t} \\arcsin\\left(\\sigma \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nTo express the pre-factor in terms of $\\sigma$ and $\\kappa$, we use their definitions:\n$$\nc k \\Delta t = \\left(\\frac{c \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\right) (k \\Delta x) = \\sigma \\kappa\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $\\dfrac{v_{p}}{c}$, we obtain the final closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{p}}{c} = \\frac{2}{\\sigma \\kappa} \\arcsin\\left(\\sigma \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis expression quantifies the numerical dispersion of the scheme, showing how the speed of a discrete plane wave depends on its wavenumber $k$ and the discretization parameters $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta t$.",
