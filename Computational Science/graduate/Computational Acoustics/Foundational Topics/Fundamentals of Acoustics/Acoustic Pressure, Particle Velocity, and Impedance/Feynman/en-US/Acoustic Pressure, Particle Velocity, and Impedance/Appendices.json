This first practice problem explores the direct consequence of an impedance mismatch at the interface between two media, a principle that is fundamental to all forms of imaging, from medical ultrasound to geophysical exploration .

            "problem": "An otorhinolaryngology team is planning ultrasound-guided Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) of a lateral cervical lymph node. The ultrasound beam from a linear-array transducer at $10\\,\\text{MHz}$ propagates through subcutaneous fat into the underlying sternocleidomastoid muscle, encountering a planar, macroscopically smooth fat-muscle interface at normal incidence. Assume linear acoustics in lossless media, plane harmonic waves, and that multiple scattering is negligible relative to the first interface interaction. The subcutaneous fat has acoustic impedance $Z_{\\text{fat}}=1.38\\,\\text{MRayl}$ and the muscle has acoustic impedance $Z_{\\text{muscle}}=1.70\\,\\text{MRayl}$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions that acoustic impedance is $Z=\\rho c$ and that for a plane wave the acoustic pressure $p$ and particle velocity $v$ satisfy $p=Zv$, use the boundary conditions of continuity of acoustic pressure and continuity of normal particle velocity at the interface to derive the expression for the fraction of incident intensity that is reflected at normal incidence in terms of the two media impedances.

            "solution": "The setup is a plane harmonic ultrasound wave at normal incidence impinging on a planar interface between two lossless media. Let medium $1$ be subcutaneous fat with acoustic impedance $Z_{1}=Z_{\\text{fat}}$, and medium $2$ be muscle with acoustic impedance $Z_{2}=Z_{\\text{muscle}}$. Denote the complex pressure amplitudes of the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves by $P_{i}$, $P_{r}$, and $P_{t}$, respectively, and their corresponding particle velocities by $v_{i}$, $v_{r}$, and $v_{t}$. For plane waves in lossless media, the relation between pressure and particle velocity is $p=Zv$, so $v=P/Z$ for each traveling wave. With the interface taken at $x=0$ and the incident wave traveling in the $+x$ direction, the reflected wave travels in the $-x$ direction, and the transmitted wave in the $+x$ direction inside medium $2$.\n\nThe boundary conditions at $x=0$ are:\n1. Continuity of acoustic pressure: $P_{i}+P_{r}=P_{t}$.\n2. Continuity of normal particle velocity: $v_{i}+v_{r}=v_{t}$.\n\nUsing $v=P/Z$ with the sign convention that the reflected wave has opposite propagation direction, one has\n$$\nv_{i}=\\frac{P_{i}}{Z_{1}},\\quad v_{r}=-\\frac{P_{r}}{Z_{1}},\\quad v_{t}=\\frac{P_{t}}{Z_{2}}.\n$$\nThus the velocity continuity condition becomes\n$$\n\\frac{P_{i}}{Z_{1}}-\\frac{P_{r}}{Z_{1}}=\\frac{P_{t}}{Z_{2}}.\n$$\nCombine this with the pressure continuity $P_{i}+P_{r}=P_{t}$ by substituting $P_{t}$ from the velocity condition:\n$$\nP_{i}+P_{r}=\\frac{Z_{2}}{Z_{1}}\\left(P_{i}-P_{r}\\right).\n$$\nMultiply both sides by $Z_{1}$:\n$$\nZ_{1}P_{i}+Z_{1}P_{r}=Z_{2}P_{i}-Z_{2}P_{r}.\n$$\nGroup terms in $P_{r}$ and $P_{i}$:\n$$\nP_{r}(Z_{1}+Z_{2})=P_{i}(Z_{2}-Z_{1}).\n$$\nTherefore, the amplitude reflection coefficient (pressure) is\n$$\nr\\equiv\\frac{P_{r}}{P_{i}}=\\frac{Z_{2}-Z_{1}}{Z_{2}+Z_{1}}.\n$$\n\nFor plane waves at normal incidence, the time-averaged intensity $I$ in a lossless medium is proportional to the square of the pressure amplitude divided by the acoustic impedance, specifically $I=\\frac{|P|^{2}}{2Z}$. The incident and reflected intensities are both in medium $1$, so their ratio simplifies:\n$$\nR\\equiv\\frac{I_{r}}{I_{i}}=\\frac{\\frac{|P_{r}|^{2}}{2Z_{1}}}{\\frac{|P_{i}|^{2}}{2Z_{1}}}=|r|^{2}=\\left(\\frac{Z_{2}-Z_{1}}{Z_{2}+Z_{1}}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\n\nNow substitute $Z_{1}=Z_{\\text{fat}}=1.38\\,\\text{MRayl}$ and $Z_{2}=Z_{\\text{muscle}}=1.70\\,\\text{MRayl}$:\n$$\nR=\\left(\\frac{1.70-1.38}{1.70+1.38}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\frac{0.32}{3.08}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nCompute the exact rational form by noting $\\frac{0.32}{3.08}=\\frac{32}{308}=\\frac{8}{77}$, hence\n$$\nR=\\left(\\frac{8}{77}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{64}{5929}.\n$$\nConvert to decimal and round to four significant figures:\n$$\nR\\approx 0.010793\\ \\rightarrow\\ 0.01079\\ \\text{(four significant figures)}.\n$$\n\nInterpretation for echogenic boundary visibility: The reflected intensity fraction $R\\approx 0.01079$ indicates that about $1.079\\%$ of the incident intensity is returned at the fat-muscle interface. In brightness-mode imaging, such a mismatch produces a modest but detectable specular echo at normal incidence, typically on the order of $-19.7\\,\\text{dB}$ relative to the incident wave (using $10\\log_{10}(R)$), which is consistent with the commonly observed, mildly hyperechoic delineation of the fascia and muscle boundary in the neck. This level of reflectivity contributes to boundary visibility without saturating the image and generally does not obscure needle visualization; in fact, a metallic needle with acoustic impedance vastly higher than soft tissue (on the order of tens of $\\text{MRayl}$) and appropriate beam–needle angle will generate much stronger specular echoes. Nonetheless, if the insonation angle deviates from normal or the interface is rough at the scale of the wavelength, the effective reflection may decrease and boundary conspicuity may be reduced, underscoring the importance of beam steering and gain optimization during FNAC guidance.",

This means the real part of the impedance is always non-negative. Therefore, the phase angle $\\Delta(x)$ is confined to the interval $[-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]$, and the standard `arctan` function correctly gives the principal value of the argument. This expression is valid for $0  R  1$. For the case $R=1$, the argument of the arctangent becomes infinite when $\\sin(2kx+\\phi) \\ne 0$, yielding a phase difference of $\\pm\\pi/2$.
