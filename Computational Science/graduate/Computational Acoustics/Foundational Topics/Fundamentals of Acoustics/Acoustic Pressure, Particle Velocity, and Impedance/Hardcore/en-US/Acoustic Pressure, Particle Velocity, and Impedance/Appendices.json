            "solution": "The setup is a plane harmonic ultrasound wave at normal incidence impinging on a planar interface between two lossless media. Let medium $1$ be subcutaneous fat with acoustic impedance $Z_{1}=Z_{\\text{fat}}$, and medium $2$ be muscle with acoustic impedance $Z_{2}=Z_{\\text{muscle}}$. Denote the complex pressure amplitudes of the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves by $P_{i}$, $P_{r}$, and $P_{t}$, respectively, and their corresponding particle velocities by $v_{i}$, $v_{r}$, and $v_{t}$. For plane waves in lossless media, the relation between pressure and particle velocity is $p=Zv$, so $v=P/Z$ for each traveling wave. With the interface taken at $x=0$ and the incident wave traveling in the $+x$ direction, the reflected wave travels in the $-x$ direction, and the transmitted wave in the $+x$ direction inside medium $2$.\n\nThe boundary conditions at $x=0$ are:\n1. Continuity of acoustic pressure: $P_{i}+P_{r}=P_{t}$.\n2. Continuity of normal particle velocity: $v_{i}+v_{r}=v_{t}$.\n\nUsing $v=P/Z$ with the sign convention that the reflected wave has opposite propagation direction, one has\n$$\nv_{i}=\\frac{P_{i}}{Z_{1}},\\quad v_{r}=-\\frac{P_{r}}{Z_{1}},\\quad v_{t}=\\frac{P_{t}}{Z_{2}}.\n$$\nThus the velocity continuity condition becomes\n$$\n\\frac{P_{i}}{Z_{1}}-\\frac{P_{r}}{Z_{1}}=\\frac{P_{t}}{Z_{2}}.\n$$\nCombine this with the pressure continuity $P_{i}+P_{r}=P_{t}$ by substituting $P_{t}$ from the velocity condition:\n$$\nP_{i}+P_{r}=\\frac{Z_{2}}{Z_{1}}\\left(P_{i}-P_{r}\\right).\n$$\nMultiply both sides by $Z_{1}$:\n$$\nZ_{1}P_{i}+Z_{1}P_{r}=Z_{2}P_{i}-Z_{2}P_{r}.\n$$\nGroup terms in $P_{r}$ and $P_{i}$:\n$$\nP_{r}(Z_{1}+Z_{2})=P_{i}(Z_{2}-Z_{1}).\n$$\nTherefore, the amplitude reflection coefficient (pressure) is\n$$\nr\\equiv\\frac{P_{r}}{P_{i}}=\\frac{Z_{2}-Z_{1}}{Z_{2}+Z_{1}}.\n$$\n\nFor plane waves at normal incidence, the time-averaged intensity $I$ in a lossless medium is proportional to the square of the pressure amplitude divided by the acoustic impedance, specifically $I=\\frac{|P|^{2}}{2Z}$.

This level of reflectivity contributes to boundary visibility without saturating the image and generally does not obscure needle visualization; in fact, a metallic needle with acoustic impedance vastly higher than soft tissue (on the order of tens of $\\text{MRayl}$) and appropriate beam–needle angle will generate much stronger specular echoes. Nonetheless, if the insonation angle deviates from normal or the interface is rough at the scale of the wavelength, the effective reflection may decrease and boundary conspicuity may be reduced, underscoring the importance of beam steering and gain optimization during FNAC guidance.",

Let $\\hat{U}_s$ be the total volume velocity from the source, which flows into the junction where the parallel branches begin. This velocity divides between the load branch ($\\hat{U}_L$) and the resonator branch ($\\hat{U}_h$).\nUsing the volume velocity divider rule (analogous to the current divider in electronics), the velocity in the load branch is:\n$$ \\hat{U}_L = \\hat{U}_s \\frac{Z_h}{Z_L + Z_h} $$\nA perfect stop-band notch occurs when $\\lvert \\hat{U}_L \\rvert = 0$. Assuming the source velocity $\\hat{U}_s$ is finite and non-zero, this condition is met if the transfer function term $\\frac{Z_h}{Z_L + Z_h}$ becomes zero. This happens when the numerator $Z_h$ is zero (provided the denominator is not also zero, which is the case here as $Z_L = R_L  0$).\nWe set the impedance of the Helmholtz resonator branch to zero to find the notch frequency $\\omega_0$:\n$$ Z_h(\\omega_0) = j \\omega_0 M_h + \\frac{1}{j \\omega_0 C_h} = 0 $$\n$$ j \\omega_0 M_h = - \\frac{1}{j \\omega_0 C_h} = \\frac{j}{\\omega_0 C_h} $$\n$$ \\omega_0 M_h = \\frac{1}{\\omega_0 C_h} $$\n$$ \\omega_0^2 = \\frac{1}{M_h C_h} $$\n$$ \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{M_h C_h}} $$\nAt this frequency, the Helmholtz resonator branch has zero impedance, acting as a short circuit. All the volume velocity is diverted through this side branch, and none passes through the load $R_L$, creating a perfect transmission null.\n\n**4. Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A.** The expression for input impedance is $Z_{\\text{in}}(\\omega) = j \\omega M_s + \\dfrac{R_L \\left(j \\omega M_h + \\dfrac{1}{j \\omega C_h}\\right)}{R_L + j \\omega M_h + \\dfrac{1}{j \\omega C_h}}$. This matches our derived expression for $Z_{\\text{in}}(\\omega)$. The bandstop notch frequency is given as $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{M_h C_h}}$. This also matches our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B.** The expression for input impedance is $Z_{\\text{in}}(\\omega) = j \\omega M_s + R_L + j \\omega M_h + \\dfrac{1}{j \\omega C_h}$. This formula represents all elements connected in series, which contradicts the problem's description of a parallel network structure. The notch frequency is given as $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_h}{C_h}}$, which is dimensionally incorrect for an angular frequency. The units of $M_h$ are $[M][L^{-4}]$ and the units of $C_h$ are $[M^{-1}][T^2][L^4]$, so $\\sqrt{M_h/C_h}$ has units of $[M][L^{-4}][T^{-1}]$, not $[T^{-1}]$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C.** The expression for input impedance is $Z_{\\text{in}}(\\omega) = \\left(j \\omega M_s \\parallel R_L\\right) + j \\omega M_h + \\dfrac{1}{j \\omega C_h}$. This represents a different network topology where the source inertance and the load resistance are in parallel, which is incorrect. The notch frequency is given as $\\omega_0 = \\dfrac{1}{M_h C_h}$, which has units of $[T^{-2}]$. This is angular frequency squared, not angular frequency.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D.** The expression for input impedance is $Z_{\\text{in}}(\\omega) = j \\omega M_s + \\left(R_L + j \\omega M_h + \\dfrac{1}{j \\omega C_h}\\right)$. This is the same incorrect series impedance as in option B. The stated notch condition is as $\\omega \\to \\infty$. As shown in our analysis, the notch occurs at the finite resonance frequency $\\omega_0$. As $\\omega \\to \\infty$, the impedance of the resonator branch $Z_h \\to j\\omega M_h \\to \\infty$, so it acts as an open circuit and has no shunting effect. Transmission to the load approaches unity, which is the opposite of a notch.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the derivations, only option A provides both the correct input impedance for the specified network and the correct condition for the bandstop notch.",
