            "problem": "In one-dimensional numerical modeling of seismic wave propagation, spatial gradients of a smooth scalar wavefield $f(x)$ along a survey line are frequently approximated on a uniform grid with spacing $h$ using symmetric finite-difference stencils. Consider the central difference approximation\n$$\n\\frac{f_{i+1}-f_{i-1}}{2h}\n$$\nto the spatial derivative $f'(x_i)$, where $f_i \\equiv f(x_i)$ and $x_{i\\pm 1} = x_i \\pm h$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the order of accuracy and the leading truncation error term for the central difference approximation of the first derivative, $f'(x_i)$. The approximation is given by the formula $\\frac{f_{i+1}-f_{i-1}}{2h}$, where $f_j \\equiv f(x_j)$ and $x_{i \\pm 1} = x_i \\pm h$. The derivation must be founded on the Taylor series expansion of the function $f(x)$ about the point $x_i$.\n\nThe local truncation error, which we denote as $\\tau(x_i, h)$, is formally defined as the difference between the finite difference approximation applied to the exact function and the exact derivative it is intended to approximate. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\tau(x_i, h) = \\frac{f(x_i+h) - f(x_i-h)}{2h} - f'(x_i)\n$$\nTo analyze this expression, we invoke the Taylor series for $f(x)$ expanded about the point $x_i$. The problem premise of $f(x)$ being \"sufficiently smooth\" ensures the validity of this expansion. We expand $f(x_i+h)$ and $f(x_i-h)$ and denote the $n$-th derivative of $f(x)$ evaluated at $x_i$ as $f^{(n)}(x_i)$. For clarity, we also use the notation $f_i \\equiv f(x_i)$.\n\nThe Taylor series expansion for $f(x_i+h)$ is:\n$$\nf_{i+1} = f(x_i+h) = f(x_i) + h f'(x_i) + \\frac{h^2}{2!} f''(x_i) + \\frac{h^3}{3!} f^{(3)}(x_i) + \\frac{h^4}{4!} f^{(4)}(x_i) + \\frac{h^5}{5!} f^{(5)}(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^6)\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for the factorials:\n$$\nf_{i+1} = f_i + h f'(x_i) + \\frac{h^2}{2} f''(x_i) + \\frac{h^3}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i) + \\frac{h^4}{24} f^{(4)}(x_i) + \\frac{h^5}{120} f^{(5)}(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^6)\n$$\nSimilarly, the Taylor series expansion for $f(x_i-h)$ is:\n$$\nf_{i-1} = f(x_i-h) = f(x_i) + (-h) f'(x_i) + \\frac{(-h)^2}{2!} f''(x_i) + \\frac{(-h)^3}{3!} f^{(3)}(x_i) + \\frac{(-h)^4}{4!} f^{(4)}(x_i) + \\frac{(-h)^5}{5!} f^{(5)}(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^6)\n$$\n$$\nf_{i-1} = f_i - h f'(x_i) + \\frac{h^2}{2} f''(x_i) - \\frac{h^3}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i) + \\frac{h^4}{24} f^{(4)}(x_i) - \\frac{h^5}{120} f^{(5)}(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^6)\n$$\nAs mandated by the problem, we now systematically demonstrate the cancellation of terms.

As $h \\to 0$, the term $\\frac{h^2}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i)$ is the dominant part of the error, assuming $f^{(3)}(x_i) \\neq 0$. The error is therefore proportional to $h^2$, which is written as $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$. This means the central difference approximation is second-order accurate.\n\nThe leading-order truncation error term is the first non-zero term in the error series.
