The explicit forward Euler method is a fundamental numerical scheme. The concept of A-stability (or in this case, a subset of it for the real line) is central to the field of numerical analysis, particularly for stiff equations as found in computational combustion. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for a standard derivation of a stability bound and a subsequent calculation. The derivation leads to a unique inequality and the calculation yields a single, well-defined numerical answer.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard terminology from mathematics and computational science.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides all necessary information: the governing equation, the numerical method, the constraints on the parameter $\\lambda$, and the stability criterion.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem concerns the temporal evolution of a scalar quantity $y(t)$ governed by the linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\ny'(t) = \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\lambda y(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a real, negative constant ($\\lambda  0$). We wish to solve this equation numerically using the explicit forward Euler (FE) method.\n\nLet $y_n$ be the numerical approximation of the solution $y(t)$ at a discrete time $t_n = n \\Delta t$, where $\\Delta t$ is the time step. The FE method approximates the derivative $y'(t_n)$ using a forward finite difference:\n$$\n\\frac{y_{n+1} - y_n}{\\Delta t} \\approx y'(t_n)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the governing ODE evaluated at $t_n$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{y_{n+1} - y_n}{\\Delta t} = \\lambda y_n\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $y_{n+1}$ gives the discrete update rule for the forward Euler method:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t (\\lambda y_n)\n$$\n$$\ny_{n+1} = (1 + \\lambda \\Delta t) y_n\n$$\nThis equation relates the solution at the next time step, $y_{n+1}$, to the solution at the current time step, $y_n$. The term $G = 1 + \\lambda \\Delta t$ is known as the amplification factor, as it determines how the magnitude of the solution is amplified (or damped) from one step to the next.\n\nThe problem requires that perturbations do not grow in magnitude. This translates to the absolute stability condition, which states that the magnitude of the numerical solution must not increase over time. For a one-step method, this means:\n$$\n|y_{n+1}| \\le |y_n|\n$$\nSubstituting the update rule into this inequality, we have:\n$$\n|(1 + \\lambda \\Delta t) y_n| \\le |y_n|\n$$\nAssuming $y_n \\neq 0$, we can divide by $|y_n|$ to get the condition on the amplification factor $G$:\n$$\n|G| \\le 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad |1 + \\lambda \\Delta t| \\le 1\n$$\nThis absolute value inequality is equivalent to the following pair of inequalities:\n$$\n-1 \\le 1 + \\lambda \\Delta t \\le 1\n$$\nTo find the condition on $\\Delta t$, we first subtract $1$ from all parts of the inequality:\n$$\n-2 \\le \\lambda \\Delta t \\le 0\n$$\nWe are given that $\\lambda  0$. The time step $\\Delta t$ must be positive, so $\\Delta t  0$. Consequently, the product $\\lambda \\Delta t$ is always negative. This means the right-hand side of the inequality, $\\lambda \\Delta t \\le 0$, is automatically satisfied.\n\nThe stability of the method is therefore constrained only by the left-hand side of the inequality:\n$$\n-2 \\le \\lambda \\Delta t\n$$\nTo isolate $\\Delta t$, we divide by $\\lambda$. Since $\\lambda$ is negative, this operation reverses the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$\n\\frac{-2}{\\lambda} \\ge \\Delta t\n$$\nThis can be written more conventionally as:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le -\\frac{2}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThis is the derived condition on the time step $\\Delta t$ that guarantees stability for the forward Euler method applied to the given ODE with real, negative $\\lambda$.\n\nNow, we apply this result to the specific case where $\\lambda = -10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The largest time step, $\\Delta t_{\\text{max}}$, that satisfies the stability condition is given by the equality:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{max}} = -\\frac{2}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value of $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{max}} = -\\frac{2}{-10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{2}{10^{6}}\\ \\mathrm{s} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.

For this value, the amplification factor is:\n    $$\n    |G(0)| = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{4\\alpha \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^{2}} \\sin^2(0)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0} = 1\n    $$\n    This holds for any $\\Delta t  0$.\n\n2.  For a fixed $\\theta \\in (0, 2\\pi)$, so that $\\sin^2(\\theta/2)  0$, we consider the limit as $\\Delta t \\to 0^+$. The denominator term approaches $0$:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0^+} \\frac{4\\alpha \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^{2}} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = 0\n    $$\n    Therefore, the limit of $|G(\\theta)|$ is:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0^+} |G(\\theta)| = \\frac{1}{1 + 0} = 1\n    $$\n\nIn all cases, the value of $|G(\\theta)|$ is bounded above by $1$. This value, $1$, is actually achieved for all $\\Delta t  0$ when $\\theta=0$. Therefore, the maximum value of $|G(\\theta)|$ over the given domain is $1$. The supremum of a set is the least upper bound, and since the value $1$ is attained, the supremum is also $1$.\n\nThis result demonstrates the unconditional stability of the Backward Euler scheme for the heat equation, as $|G(\\theta)| \\le 1$ for all valid parameters.
