            "problem": "A classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation is performed for a binary mixture in three spatial dimensions under periodic boundary conditions. The mixture contains $N_{\\mathrm{Ar}}$ monatomic argon atoms and $N_{\\mathrm{H}_2}$ diatomic hydrogen molecules modeled with a single holonomic bond-length constraint per molecule to enforce rigidity. The integrator removes the total center-of-mass (COM) linear momentum at every time step.

            "solution": "The problem statement asks for the correct expression for the instantaneous kinetic temperature $T$ of a system simulated using classical Molecular Dynamics. The temperature is defined based on the total instantaneous kinetic energy $K$ and the number of unconstrained quadratic velocity degrees of freedom, $f$.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental relationship between kinetic energy and temperature from the equipartition theorem. The theorem states that for a system in thermal equilibrium, the average energy associated with each quadratic degree of freedom is $\\frac{1}{2}k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$, where $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant. The kinetic energy of a system of particles is a sum over terms that are quadratic in the velocity components. If the system has $f$ such independent (unconstrained) velocity degrees of freedom, the total average kinetic energy is given by:\n$$ \\langle K \\rangle = f \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{B}} T $$\nIn Molecular Dynamics simulations, the instantaneous kinetic temperature is defined by applying this relationship to the instantaneous kinetic energy, rather than the time-averaged value:\n$$ K = \\frac{f}{2} k_{\\mathrm{B}} T $$\nSolving for the temperature $T$, we get:\n$$ T = \\frac{2K}{f k_{\\mathrm{B}}} $$\nThis is the general formula. The central part of the problem is to determine the correct value of $f$, the number of kinetic degrees of freedom.\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom $f$ is calculated by starting with the total number of motional degrees of freedom for all atoms and then subtracting the number of degrees of freedom removed by constraints.\n\n1.  **Total number of atoms and initial degrees of freedom:**\n    The system consists of $N_{\\mathrm{Ar}} = 500$ monatomic argon atoms and $N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 200$ diatomic hydrogen molecules.\n    Each argon atom is a single particle.\n    Each hydrogen molecule consists of $2$ atoms.\n    The total number of atoms (point masses) in the simulation, let's call it $N$, is:\n    $$ N = N_{\\mathrm{Ar}} + 2 N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 500 + 2(200) = 500 + 400 = 900 \\text{ atoms} $$\n    In three spatial dimensions, each of these $N$ atoms initially has $3$ translational degrees of freedom, corresponding to motion along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes.\n    The total initial number of translational degrees of freedom is therefore $3N$:\n    $$ \\text{Initial DOFs} = 3N = 3 \\times 900 = 2700 $$\n\n2.  **Constraints on the system:**\n    The problem specifies two types of constraints that reduce the number of independent degrees of freedom.\n\n    a.  **Holonomic constraints:** There are $N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 200$ hydrogen molecules, and each is modeled as a rigid diatom. This rigidity is enforced by a holonomic bond-length constraint. The problem states that each such constraint removes exactly one independent scalar degree of freedom. Therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom removed by these constraints, denoted $N_c$, is:\n    $$ N_c = N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 200 $$\n\n    b.  **Center-of-mass (COM) momentum constraint:** The problem states that the integrator removes the total center-of-mass linear momentum at every time step. This is equivalent to constraining the total linear momentum of the system to be zero: $\\vec{P}_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \\vec{v}_i = \\vec{0}$. Since linear momentum is a vector in three dimensions, this imposes three independent scalar constraints on the system's velocities ($P_x=0$, $P_y=0$, $P_z=0$). These constraints remove $3$ degrees of freedom.\n\n3.  **Final number of degrees of freedom ($f$):**\n    The final number of unconstrained kinetic degrees of freedom, $f$, is the initial total minus the number of degrees of freedom removed by all constraints.\n    $$ f = (\\text{Initial DOFs}) - (\\text{Holonomic constraints}) - (\\text{COM momentum constraints}) $$\n    $$ f = 3N - N_c - 3 $$\n    Substituting the values we have:\n    $N = 900$\n    $N_c = 200$\n    $$ f = 3(900) - 200 - 3 = 2700 - 200 - 3 = 2497 $$\n\n4.  **Final expression for temperature:**\n    Substituting $f = 2497$ into the temperature formula $T = \\frac{2K}{f k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$, we obtain:\n    $$ T = \\frac{2K}{2497 k_{\\mathrm{B}}} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the given options.\n\n**A. $T = \\dfrac{2K}{f k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$ with $f = 3N - N_c - 3$, where $N = N_{\\mathrm{Ar}} + 2N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 900$ and $N_c = N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 200$, so $f = 2497$.**\n- The temperature formula $T = \\dfrac{2K}{f k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$ is correct.\n- The total number of atoms $N = N_{\\mathrm{Ar}} + 2N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 900$ is correct.\n- The number of holonomic constraints $N_c = N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 200$ is correct.\n- The formula for the degrees of freedom, $f = 3N - N_c - 3$, correctly accounts for the total atoms, the bond constraints, and the COM momentum constraint.\n- The calculation $f = 3(900) - 200 - 3 = 2497$ is correct.\n- This option is fully consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $T = \\dfrac{K}{f k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$ with $f = 3N - N_c - 3$, where $N = N_{\\mathrm{Ar}} + 2N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 900$ and $N_c = N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 200$, so $f = 2497$.**\n- The calculation of the number of degrees of freedom, $f=2497$, is correct.\n- However, the temperature formula $T = \\dfrac{K}{f k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$ is incorrect. It is missing the factor of $2$ in the numerator, which arises from the fact that each quadratic degree of freedom contributes $\\frac{1}{2}k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ to the energy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $T = \\dfrac{2K}{f k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$ with $f = 3N$, where $N = N_{\\mathrm{Ar}} + 2N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 900$, so $f = 2700$.**\n- The temperature formula $T = \\dfrac{2K}{f k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$ is correct.\n- The calculation for $f$ is $f = 3N = 2700$. This count does not subtract the degrees of freedom removed by the holonomic constraints ($N_c = 200$) and the COM motion constraint ($3$). This is therefore an incorrect count of the unconstrained degrees of freedom.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $T = \\dfrac{2K}{f k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$ with $f = 3N - 2N_c - 3$, where $N = N_{\\mathrm{Ar}} + 2N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 900$ and $N_c = N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 200$, so $f = 2297$.**\n- The temperature formula $T = \\dfrac{2K}{f k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$ is correct.\n- The formula used for the degrees of freedom, $f = 3N - 2N_c - 3$, is incorrect. It subtracts $2N_c$ instead of $N_c$ for the holonomic constraints. Each of the $N_c$ scalar bond-length constraints removes only one degree of freedom, not two.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $T = \\dfrac{2K}{3N k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$ with $N = N_{\\mathrm{Ar}} + 2N_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 900$.**\n- This is a compact form of option C. It implicitly uses $f=3N$. As explained for option C, this is an incorrect count of the degrees of freedom because it ignores all constraints on the system.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nOnly option A provides the correct temperature formula and the correct calculation of the number of degrees of freedom.",
