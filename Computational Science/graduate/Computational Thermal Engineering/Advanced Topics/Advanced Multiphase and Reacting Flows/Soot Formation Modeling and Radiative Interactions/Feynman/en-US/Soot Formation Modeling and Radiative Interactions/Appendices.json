            "problem": "A polydisperse soot aggregate formed in a turbulent diffusion flame is modeled as a cluster of $N$ identical primary spheres of radius $r_p$ and solid soot density $\\rho_s$. The aggregate exhibits a mass-fractal morphology characterized by a fractal dimension $D_f$ and a cluster prefactor $k_f$. The aggregate’s spatial extent for radiative interaction modeling is represented by a spherical “envelope” whose radius is a fixed multiple of the aggregate radius of gyration $R_g$, specifically $R_{\\text{env}}=\\xi R_g$, where $\\xi$ is a prescribed morphology factor. The envelope volume $V_{\\text{env}}$ is used in effective-medium closures for the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) and Rayleigh–Debye–Gans for Fractal Aggregates (RDG-FA), thereby requiring a thermodynamically consistent effective aggregate density.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions, the effective aggregate density is defined as $\\rho_{\\text{eff}}=M/V_{\\text{env}}$, where $M$ is the aggregate mass. The primary sphere volume is $V_p=(4/3)\\pi r_p^3$, so $M=\\rho_s N V_p$. The fractal relation between $N$ and $R_g$ is given by the well-tested mass–fractal scaling $N=k_f\\left(R_g/r_p\\right)^{D_f}$.

All provided parameters and definitions are standard within the fields of aerosol science and computational thermal engineering. The values given for the fractal dimension, prefactor, primary particle size, and solid density are physically realistic for soot aggregates. The problem is a valid exercise in applying fundamental definitions to derive a property of a fractal aggregate.\n\nThe objective is to derive a closed-form expression for the effective aggregate density, $\\rho_{\\text{eff}}$, and compute its numerical value. The definition of effective density is given as:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{M}{V_{\\text{env}}}\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the total mass of the aggregate and $V_{\\text{env}}$ is the volume of its radiative envelope.\n\nFirst, we express the aggregate mass $M$ in terms of the given parameters. The aggregate consists of $N$ primary spheres, each with volume $V_p$ and density $\\rho_s$.\nThe volume of a single primary sphere of radius $r_p$ is:\n$$\nV_p = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_p^3\n$$\nThe total mass $M$ is the product of the number of primary spheres, the density of the solid material, and the volume of a single primary sphere:\n$$\nM = N \\rho_s V_p = N \\rho_s \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_p^3\\right)\n$$\n\nNext, we express the envelope volume $V_{\\text{env}}$. The envelope is a sphere of radius $R_{\\text{env}} = \\xi R_g$, where $R_g$ is the radius of gyration of the aggregate and $\\xi$ is a morphology factor. The volume is therefore:\n$$\nV_{\\text{env}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_{\\text{env}}^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (\\xi R_g)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\xi^3 R_g^3\n$$\nThis expression still contains the radius of gyration, $R_g$, which is not a directly provided parameter.

It shows that for a fractal dimension $D_f  3$, the exponent $1 - 3/D_f$ is negative, indicating that the effective density decreases as the number of primary particles $N$ increases, which is consistent with the increasingly porous nature of larger fractal aggregates.\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression:\n- $N = 500$\n- $r_p = 25 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}$ (This parameter canceled out, as expected for a pure scaling relationship)\n- $D_f = 1.8$\n- $k_f = 1.2$\n- $\\xi = 1.5$\n- $\\rho_s = 1800\\ \\text{kg m}^{-3}$\n\nFirst, we compute the exponent:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{3}{D_f} = 1 - \\frac{3}{1.8} = 1 - \\frac{30}{18} = 1 - \\frac{5}{3} = -\\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe exponent on the term $k_f$ is $3/D_f = 5/3$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\rho_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{eff}} = (1800) \\frac{(1.2)^{5/3}}{(1.5)^3} (500)^{-2/3}\n$$\nLet's compute the components of this expression:\n$$\n(1.2)^{5/3} \\approx 1.355106\n$$\n$$\n(1.5)^3 = 3.375\n$$\n$$\n(500)^{-2/3} = \\frac{1}{(500)^{2/3}} \\approx \\frac{1}{62.99605} \\approx 0.0158740\n$$\nNow, we combine these values:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 1800 \\times \\frac{1.355106}{3.375} \\times 0.0158740\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 1800 \\times 0.4015129 \\times 0.0158740\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 11.4725\\ \\text{kg m}^{-3}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 11.47\\ \\text{kg m}^{-3}\n$$\nAs a final physical consistency check, we can evaluate the void fraction $\\varepsilon = 1 - \\rho_{\\text{eff}}/\\rho_s$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon = 1 - \\frac{11.47}{1800} \\approx 1 - 0.00637 \\approx 0.99363\n$$\nThis value is between $0$ and $1$, indicating a highly porous structure ($>99\\%$ void), which is physically plausible for a soot aggregate of this size.",

Substituting the given Arrhenius expressions for these fluxes, we arrive at the first governing ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dr_p}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\rho_s} \\left[ k_{g0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{R T(t)}\\right) m_C C_F - k_{o0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_o}{R T(t)}\\right) m_C C_{O_2} \\right] $$\nwhere $C_F$ and $C_{O_2}$ are the molar concentrations of the fuel precursor and oxygen, respectively. All other parameters are defined in the problem statement.\n\nNext, we derive the governing equation for the particle temperature, $\\frac{dT}{dt}$. We begin with the provided energy balance for the particle:\n$$ m_p(t) c_p \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\chi I(t) A(t) - \\varepsilon \\sigma A(t) \\left(T(t)^4 - T_s^4\\right) - h A(t) \\left(T(t) - T_g\\right) $$\nHere, $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity of soot, and the terms on the right-hand side represent, in order, absorbed incident radiation, net emitted radiation, and convective heat loss. To find $\\frac{dT}{dt}$, we isolate it by dividing by $m_p(t) c_p$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{1}{m_p(t) c_p} \\left[ \\chi I(t) A(t) - \\varepsilon \\sigma A(t) \\left(T(t)^4 - T_s^4\\right) - h A(t) \\left(T(t) - T_g\\right) \\right] $$\nWe can factor out $A(t)$ and substitute the expressions for $m_p(t)$ and $A(t)$ in terms of $r_p(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{A(t)}{m_p(t) c_p} \\left[ \\chi I(t) - \\varepsilon \\sigma \\left(T(t)^4 - T_s^4\\right) - h \\left(T(t) - T_g\\right) \\right] $$\nThe pre-factor simplifies as:\n$$ \\frac{A(t)}{m_p(t) c_p} = \\frac{4\\pi r_p(t)^2}{\\left(\\rho_s \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_p(t)^3\\right) c_p} = \\frac{3}{\\rho_s c_p r_p(t)} $$\nThis yields the second governing ODE, which is valid for $r_p(t) > 0$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{3}{\\rho_s c_p r_p(t)} \\left[ \\chi I(t) - \\varepsilon \\sigma \\left(T(t)^4 - T_s^4\\right) - h \\left(T(t) - T_g\\right) \\right] $$\nThe term $I(t)$ represents the time-dependent incident radiation.\n\nThe two coupled, non-linear ODEs form an initial value problem (IVP) for the state vector $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [r_p(t), T(t)]^T$ with the initial conditions $r_p(0)$ and $T(0) = T_g$. To solve this system, we employ a numerical approach. The `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function from the `SciPy` library is suitable for this task. It is a robust adaptive step-size ODE solver.\n\nA critical aspect of the problem is the burnout condition: if the particle radius $r_p(t)$ decreases to zero, the particle is consumed, and the simulation must stop. The `solve_ivp` function provides an event handling mechanism that is ideal for this purpose. An event function is defined to monitor the value of $r_p(t)$ and trigger a termination of the integration when $r_p(t)$ crosses zero. If this event occurs, the final radius is reported as exactly $0.0$ meters. If the integration completes to the specified end time $t_{\\text{end}} = 0.2$ seconds without the burnout event occurring, the final radius is the value of $r_p(t)$ at $t=t_{\\text{end}}$. The implementation will process each test case by setting the appropriate parameters and initial conditions, solving the IVP, and reporting the final radius according to these rules.",
