Assume that at any temperature $T$ within the two-phase region, the liquid and solid in a representative volume are each compositionally uniform and are connected by a tie line on the equilibrium phase diagram. The equilibrium phase diagram is locally linearized in the dilute regime by\n$$T = T_M + m_L\\,C_L,\\qquad T = T_M + m_S\\,C_S,$$\nwhere $T_M$ is the melting temperature of the pure solvent, $m_L$ and $m_S$ are the constant slopes of the liquidus and solidus, respectively, with $m_L0$ and $m_S0$, and $C_L$ and $C_S$ are the solute concentrations in the liquid and solid at temperature $T$. Assume negligible macroscopic segregation so that the volume-averaged solute concentration remains $C_0$ throughout solidification.\n\nStarting only from conservation of solute in a representative two-phase volume and the local equilibrium tie-line relations given above, derive a closed-form expression for the solid fraction $f_s$ as an explicit function of $T$, $C_0$, $T_M$, $m_L$, and $m_S$ that is valid for $T$ in the two-phase interval between the temperatures corresponding to the liquidus and solidus at $C_0$.

The assumptions provided are standard for the derivation of the Lever Rule for solidification. No flaws are identified.\n\nThe derivation of the solid fraction, $f_s$, as a function of temperature, $T$, proceeds from the principle of conservation of solute within a representative two-phase volume.\n\nThe problem states that the volume-averaged solute concentration remains constant at the initial concentration, $C_0$, throughout solidification. This represents a closed system with respect to mass and solute. The total solute in a representative volume is the sum of the solute in the solid phase and the solute in the liquid phase. Let $f_s$ be the mass fraction of solid and $f_l$ be the mass fraction of liquid. As the system is composed of only these two phases, their fractions must sum to unity:\n$$f_s + f_l = 1$$\nThe overall solute concentration, $C_0$, is the weighted average of the concentrations in the solid phase, $C_S$, and the liquid phase, $C_L$:\n$$C_0 = f_s C_S + f_l C_L$$\nThe problem assumes that within the representative volume, each phase is compositionally uniform. Substituting $f_l = 1 - f_s$ into the conservation equation gives:\n$$C_0 = f_s C_S + (1 - f_s) C_L$$\n$$C_0 = f_s C_S + C_L - f_s C_L$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the solid fraction, $f_s$:\n$$f_s (C_L - C_S) = C_L - C_0$$\n$$f_s = \\frac{C_L - C_0}{C_L - C_S}$$\nThis expression is known as the Lever Rule.\n\nThe next step is to express the concentrations $C_L$ and $C_S$ as functions of temperature, $T$, using the provided linearized phase diagram relations:\n$$T = T_M + m_L C_L$$\n$$T = T_M + m_S C_S$$\nwhere $T_M$ is the melting point of the pure solvent, and $m_L$ and $m_S$ are the constant slopes of the liquidus and solidus lines, respectively. We can rearrange these equations to solve for $C_L$ and $C_S$ at a given temperature $T$ in the two-phase region:\n$$C_L(T) = \\frac{T - T_M}{m_L}$$\n$$C_S(T) = \\frac{T - T_M}{m_S}$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $C_L$ and $C_S$ into the Lever Rule equation for $f_s$:\n$$f_s(T) = \\frac{\\frac{T - T_M}{m_L} - C_0}{\\frac{T - T_M}{m_L} - \\frac{T - T_M}{m_S}}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we can first combine the terms in the denominator:\n$$\\frac{T - T_M}{m_L} - \\frac{T - T_M}{m_S} = (T - T_M) \\left( \\frac{1}{m_L} - \\frac{1}{m_S} \\right) = (T - T_M) \\left( \\frac{m_S - m_L}{m_L m_S} \\right)$$\nThe numerator can be written as:\n$$\\frac{T - T_M}{m_L} - C_0 = \\frac{T - T_M - m_L C_0}{m_L}$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $f_s(T)$:\n$$f_s(T) = \\frac{\\frac{T - T_M - m_L C_0}{m_L}}{(T - T_M) \\left( \\frac{m_S - m_L}{m_L m_S} \\right)}$$\n$$f_s(T) = \\left( \\frac{T - T_M - m_L C_0}{m_L} \\right) \\left( \\frac{m_L m_S}{(T - T_M)(m_S - m_L)} \\right)$$\nThe term $m_L$ cancels out, yielding:\n$$f_s(T) = \\frac{m_S (T - T_M - m_L C_0)}{(m_S - m_L)(T - T_M)}$$\nThis is a valid expression, but it can be simplified further for clarity. We can separate the terms containing $T$ from the constant parameters:\n$$f_s(T) = \\left( \\frac{m_S}{m_S - m_L} \\right) \\left( \\frac{T - T_M - m_L C_0}{T - T_M} \\right)$$\nThe second term in parentheses can be split into two parts:\n$$f_s(T) = \\left( \\frac{m_S}{m_S - m_L} \\right) \\left( \\frac{T - T_M}{T - T_M} - \\frac{m_L C_0}{T - T_M} \\right)$$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression for the solid fraction as a function of temperature and the given parameters:\n$$f_s(T) = \\frac{m_S}{m_S - m_L} \\left( 1 - \\frac{m_L C_0}{T - T_M} \\right)$$\nThis equation is valid for temperatures $T$ within the two-phase (mushy) region, which is bounded by the liquidus temperature $T_L = T_M + m_L C_0$ (where $f_s=0$) and the solidus temperature $T_S = T_M + m_S C_0$ (where $f_s=1$ under the equilibrium conditions of the Lever Rule).",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to find the peak value of the effective heat capacity, $c_{\\text{eff,peak}}$, and to verify that the integral of its latent heat component over all temperatures equals $L$.\n\nThe effective heat capacity is given by:\n$$c_{\\text{eff}}(T) = c_p + L\\,g(T)$$\nwhere $c_p$ is a constant and $g(T)$ is the Gaussian function:\n$$g(T) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{(T-T_m)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\Big)$$\nThe peak value of $c_{\\text{eff}}(T)$ occurs when the function $g(T)$ reaches its maximum value. The Gaussian function is centered at $T=T_m$, and its maximum value occurs at this point. At $T=T_m$, the exponential term becomes $\\exp(0) = 1$.\nThe peak value of $g(T)$, denoted $g_{\\text{peak}}$, is therefore:\n$$g_{\\text{peak}} = g(T_m) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $c_{\\text{eff}}(T)$ gives the peak effective heat capacity, $c_{\\text{eff,peak}}$:\n$$c_{\\text{eff,peak}} = c_p + L\\,g_{\\text{peak}} = c_p + \\frac{L}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}}$$\nThis expression depends on $\\sigma$, the standard deviation of the Gaussian. The problem requires the final answer in terms of $L$, $\\Delta T$, and $c_p$. We must therefore establish a relationship between $\\sigma$ and $\\Delta T$.\n\nThe mushy temperature interval $\\Delta T$ is defined as the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $g(T)$. The half-maximum value is $\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\text{peak}}$. We need to find the two temperatures, say $T_1$ and $T_2$, at which $g(T) = \\frac{1}{2}g_{\\text{peak}}$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{(T-T_m)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\Big) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\right) $$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$$ \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{(T-T_m)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\Big) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{(T-T_m)^2}{2\\sigma^2} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2) $$\n$$ \\frac{(T-T_m)^2}{2\\sigma^2} = \\ln(2) $$\nSolving for $(T-T_m)$:\n$$ (T-T_m)^2 = 2\\sigma^2\\ln(2) $$\n$$ T-T_m = \\pm\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2\\ln(2)} = \\pm \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\ln(2)} $$\nThe two temperatures are $T_1 = T_m - \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}$ and $T_2 = T_m + \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}$.\nThe FWHM, $\\Delta T$, is the difference between these two temperatures:\n$$ \\Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = \\left( T_m + \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\ln(2)} \\right) - \\left( T_m - \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\ln(2)} \\right) = 2\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\ln(2)} $$\nThis gives the desired relationship between $\\Delta T$ and $\\sigma$. We can now solve for $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{\\Delta T}{2\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}} $$\nNow we substitute this expression for $\\sigma$ back into our equation for $c_{\\text{eff,peak}}$:\n$$ c_{\\text{eff,peak}} = c_p + \\frac{L}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} = c_p + \\frac{L}{\\left( \\frac{\\Delta T}{2\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}} \\right) \\sqrt{2\\pi}} $$\nRearranging the terms gives:\n$$ c_{\\text{eff,peak}} = c_p + L \\frac{2\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}}{\\Delta T \\sqrt{2\\pi}} $$\nWe can simplify the radical term:\n$$ \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\ln(2)}{2\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\pi}} $$\nSubstituting this back, we obtain the final expression for the peak effective heat capacity:\n$$ c_{\\text{eff,peak}} = c_p + \\frac{2L}{\\Delta T} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\pi}} $$\n\n### Latent Heat Verification\n\nThe second part of the task is to verify that the total latent heat released over the entire temperature range equals $L$. The component of the effective heat capacity related to latent heat is $L\\,g(T)$. To find the total heat released per unit mass due to the phase change, we must integrate this term over all temperatures:\n$$ \\text{Total Latent Heat} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} L\\,g(T) \\,\\mathrm{d}T $$\nSince $L$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$ \\text{Total Latent Heat} = L \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(T) \\,\\mathrm{d}T $$\nThe problem states that $g(T)$ is a normalized kernel, providing the condition $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(T)\\,\\mathrm{d}T = 1$. Using this property:\n$$ \\text{Total Latent Heat} = L \\cdot 1 = L $$\nThis confirms that the model correctly accounts for the total latent heat $L$ released during solidification, distributed over the temperature range defined by the Gaussian function. The units of the derived expression for $c_{\\text{eff,peak}}$ are consistent. The term $c_p$ has units of $\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$. The term $\\frac{L}{\\Delta T}$ has units of $(\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}})/\\mathrm{K} = \\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$. The remaining factor $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\pi}}$ is dimensionless. Therefore, the entire expression correctly represents a specific heat capacity.",
