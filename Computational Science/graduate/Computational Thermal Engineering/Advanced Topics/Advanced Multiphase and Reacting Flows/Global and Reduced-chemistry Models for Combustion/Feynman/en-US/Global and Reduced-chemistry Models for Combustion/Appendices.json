            "problem": "Consider a reduced single-step global combustion model for a hydrocarbon fuel $F$ reacting with an oxidizer $O$ in a constant-volume, premixed reactor.

The magnitude $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$ is used because $\\dot{\\omega}_{F}<0$ for fuel consumption.\n\nTwo experiments are performed at the same initial composition and density, ensuring that $\\rho$, $Y_{F}$, $Y_{O}$, and $A$ are identical between experiments so that any temperature sensitivity of $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$ arises solely from the Arrhenius exponential factor. The measured magnitudes of the initial fuel-consumption rates are:\n- At $T_{1} = 1200\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})| = 4.00 \\times 10^{1}$ in consistent units.\n- At $T_{2} = 1500\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})| = 1.60 \\times 10^{2}$ in the same units.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions and the well-tested Arrhenius form of temperature dependence, derive the temperature sensitivity of the global rate in terms of the derivative $\\partial \\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|/\\partial(1/T)$ and interpret the slope in an Arrhenius plot of $\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$ versus $1/T$. Then, using the data above, compute the value of $E_{a}/R$.\n\nExpress your final answer for $E_{a}/R$ in $\\mathrm{K}$ and round your result to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as being scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It presents a standard scenario in chemical kinetics for determining activation energy from experimental data using the Arrhenius equation, a fundamental principle in the field. All necessary data and conditions are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two parts as requested: first, a derivation and interpretation of the temperature sensitivity, and second, the computation of the activation energy term $E_{a}/R$.\n\nThe global fuel-consumption rate per unit volume is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{\\omega}_{F} = -\\rho\\,A\\,Y_{F}^{\\nu}\\,Y_{O}^{\\mu}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem concerns the magnitude of this rate, $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$. Since the physical quantities $\\rho$, $A$, $Y_{F}$, and $Y_{O}$ are positive, we have:\n$$\n|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}| = \\rho\\,A\\,Y_{F}^{\\nu}\\,Y_{O}^{\\mu}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\n$$\nThe experimental conditions specify that the initial composition and density are identical for both measurements. This means the terms $\\rho$, $Y_{F}$, and $Y_{O}$ are constant. The pre-exponential factor $A$ is also stated to be temperature-independent. We can therefore group all these constant terms into a single constant, $C$:\n$$\nC = \\rho\\,A\\,Y_{F}^{\\nu}\\,Y_{O}^{\\mu}\n$$\nThe rate expression simplifies to:\n$$\n|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}| = C\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\n$$\nTo analyze the temperature sensitivity as requested, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of this equation:\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}| = \\ln\\left(C\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this becomes:\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}| = \\ln(C) + \\ln\\left(\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}| = \\ln(C) - \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a linear relationship, which becomes apparent if we consider the variable to be the reciprocal of temperature, $1/T$. Let $x = 1/T$. The equation is then:\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}| = \\ln(C) - \\left(\\frac{E_{a}}{R}\\right)x\n$$\nThis is an equation of a straight line $y = b + mx$, where $y = \\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$, the variable is $x = 1/T$, the y-intercept is $b = \\ln(C)$, and the slope is $m = -E_{a}/R$.\n\nThe problem asks for the temperature sensitivity in terms of the derivative $\\partial \\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|/\\partial(1/T)$. This is precisely the slope of the line described above. Taking the derivative of $\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$ with respect to $1/T$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|}{\\partial(1/T)} = \\frac{d}{d(1/T)}\\left(\\ln(C) - \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\ln(C)$ is a constant, its derivative is zero. The derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|}{\\partial(1/T)} = -\\frac{E_{a}}{R}\n$$\nThe interpretation of this result is that in an \"Arrhenius plot,\" where the natural logarithm of the reaction rate (or a quantity proportional to it, like $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$) is plotted on the y-axis against the reciprocal of absolute temperature ($1/T$) on the x-axis, the data should fall on a straight line. The slope of this line is equal to the negative of the activation energy divided by the universal gas constant, $-E_{a}/R$. This provides a direct graphical method for determining the activation energy of a reaction.\n\nNow, we use the provided experimental data to compute the value of $E_{a}/R$. We have two data points:\n1. $T_{1} = 1200\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})| = 4.00 \\times 10^{1}$\n2. $T_{2} = 1500\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})| = 1.60 \\times 10^{2}$\n\nWe can write the ln-linearized rate equation for each point:\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})| = \\ln(C) - \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T_{1}} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})| = \\ln(C) - \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T_{2}} \\quad (2)\n$$\nTo eliminate the unknown constant $C$, we subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})| - \\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})| = \\left(\\ln(C) - \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T_{2}}\\right) - \\left(\\ln(C) - \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T_{1}}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})|}{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})|}\\right) = -\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T_{2}} + \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T_{1}}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})|}{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})|}\\right) = \\frac{E_{a}}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{1}} - \\frac{1}{T_{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the two-point form of the Arrhenius equation. We can now solve for $E_{a}/R$:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{a}}{R} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})|}{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})|}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{T_{1}} - \\frac{1}{T_{2}}}\n$$\nSubstitute the given numerical values into this expression. First, calculate the ratio of the rates:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})|}{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})|} = \\frac{1.60 \\times 10^{2}}{4.00 \\times 10^{1}} = \\frac{160}{40} = 4.00\n$$\nNext, calculate the difference of the reciprocal temperatures:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T_{1}} - \\frac{1}{T_{2}} = \\frac{1}{1200} - \\frac{1}{1500} = \\frac{5}{6000} - \\frac{4}{6000} = \\frac{1}{6000}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}\n$$\nNow substitute these intermediate results back into the equation for $E_{a}/R$:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{a}}{R} = \\frac{\\ln(4.00)}{\\frac{1}{6000}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}} = 6000 \\cdot \\ln(4.00)\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe value of $\\ln(4.00)$ is approximately $1.38629436$.\n$$\n\\frac{E_{a}}{R} \\approx 6000 \\times 1.38629436\\ \\mathrm{K} \\approx 8317.766\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\frac{E_{a}}{R} \\approx 8318\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe unit of $E_{a}/R$ is Kelvin (K), which is consistent, as the term $E_{a}/(RT)$ in the exponential must be dimensionless.",

            "solution": "The problem has been critically assessed and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the classical theory of premixed flame propagation, is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The provided assumptions and constants allow for the derivation of a unique and meaningful solution. The minor ambiguity in the flame speed scaling relation, $S_L \\sim \\sqrt{\\alpha/\\tau_c}$, is resolved by adopting the standard interpretation for such problems, which implies a proportionality constant of unity. This leads to the direct algebraic form $S_L = \\sqrt{\\alpha/\\tau_c}$, from which the sensitivities can be rigorously derived. The test cases are well-chosen to probe different physical regimes of the model, including the high-pressure limit, the low-activation-energy limit, and the zero-pressure-order case, confirming the problem's thoughtful design.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation of the laminar flame speed, $S_L$, and its parameter sensitivities.\n\nFirst, we establish the functional form of the laminar flame speed, $S_L$, based on the provided theoretical framework. The model parameters are the pre-exponential factor $A$, the activation energy $E_a$, the pressure order $m$, and the pressure $p$. The fixed physical constants are the unburned gas temperature $T_u$, the specific heat $c_p$, the heat release $Q$, the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$, the universal gas constant $R$, and the reference pressure $p_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n\nThe adiabatic flame temperature, $T_b$, is constant for all cases as it depends only on fixed thermal properties:\n$$T_b = T_u + \\frac{Q}{c_p}$$\n\nThe Zel'dovich number, $\\beta$, which is a dimensionless measure of the activation energy, depends on $E_a$:\n$$\\beta(E_a) = \\frac{E_a (T_b - T_u)}{R T_b^2}$$\nThe asymptotic theory is valid for large $\\beta$, and the problem states to use the framework for $\\beta > 1$, a condition that holds for all specified test cases.\n\nThe effective reaction zone temperature, $T_e$, is approximated using the high-activation-energy asymptotics:\n$$T_e(E_a) = T_b \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\beta(E_a)}\\right)$$\n\nThe global one-step Arrhenius reaction rate, $k$, is evaluated at this effective temperature:\n$$k(T_e) = A \\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^m \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T_e(E_a)}\\right)$$\n\nThe flame speed, $S_L$, is related to the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$ and a characteristic chemical time $\\tau_c$. As specified, we use $\\tau_c \\approx 1/k(T_e)$ and the scaling $S_L \\sim \\sqrt{\\alpha/\\tau_c}$. Interpreting the proportionality constant as unity gives the explicit formula:\n$$S_L(A, E_a, m, p) = \\sqrt{\\alpha k(T_e)} = \\sqrt{\\alpha A \\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^m \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T_e(E_a)}\\right)}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$S_L = A^{1/2} \\alpha^{1/2} \\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{m/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{2 R T_e(E_a)}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we derive the required first-order partial derivatives. Logarithmic differentiation is a convenient tool.\n$$\\ln S_L = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln A + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln \\alpha + \\frac{m}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) - \\frac{E_a}{2 R T_e(E_a)}$$\n\n1.  **Sensitivity to the pre-exponential factor, $A$**:\n    Differentiating $\\ln S_L$ with respect to $A$ yields:\n    $$\\frac{1}{S_L}\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial A} = \\frac{1}{2A}$$\n    $$\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial A} = \\frac{S_L}{2A}$$\n\n2.  **Sensitivity to the pressure order, $m$**:\n    Differentiating $\\ln S_L$ with respect to $m$ yields:\n    $$\\frac{1}{S_L}\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial m} = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)$$\n    $$\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial m} = \\frac{S_L}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)$$\n    Note that if $p = p_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, this derivative is zero as expected.\n\n3.  **Sensitivity to the pressure, $p$**:\n    Differentiating $\\ln S_L$ with respect to $p$ yields:\n    $$\\frac{1}{S_L}\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial p} = \\frac{m}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{p/p_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{m}{2p}$$\n    $$\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial p} = \\frac{m S_L}{2p}$$\n    If $m=0$, this derivative is zero, correctly reflecting no pressure dependence.\n\n4.  **Sensitivity to the activation energy, $E_a$**:\n    This is the most complex derivative, as $E_a$ appears explicitly in the exponential term and implicitly within $T_e$.\n    $$\\frac{1}{S_L}\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial E_a} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E_a}\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{2 R T_e(E_a)}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2R} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E_a}\\left(\\frac{E_a}{T_e}\\right)$$\n    We apply the quotient rule to $\\frac{E_a}{T_e}$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E_a}\\left(\\frac{E_a}{T_e}\\right) = \\frac{1 \\cdot T_e - E_a \\cdot \\frac{\\partial T_e}{\\partial E_a}}{T_e^2} = \\frac{1}{T_e} - \\frac{E_a}{T_e^2}\\frac{\\partial T_e}{\\partial E_a}$$\n    To find $\\frac{\\partial T_e}{\\partial E_a}$, we first express $T_e$ explicitly in terms of $E_a$:\n    $$T_e(E_a) = T_b - \\frac{T_b}{\\beta(E_a)} = T_b - T_b \\left(\\frac{R T_b^2}{E_a(T_b-T_u)}\\right) = T_b - \\frac{R T_b^3}{T_b-T_u} E_a^{-1}$$\n    Differentiating with respect to $E_a$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial T_e}{\\partial E_a} = - \\left(\\frac{R T_b^3}{T_b-T_u}\\right) (-1) E_a^{-2} = \\frac{R T_b^3}{E_a^2(T_b-T_u)}$$\n    By substituting the definition of $\\beta$, this can be simplified:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial T_e}{\\partial E_a} = \\frac{R T_b^2}{E_a(T_b-T_u)} \\frac{T_b}{E_a} = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\frac{T_b}{E_a}$$\n    Substituting this back into the derivative of $E_a/T_e$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E_a}\\left(\\frac{E_a}{T_e}\\right) = \\frac{1}{T_e} - \\frac{E_a}{T_e^2} \\left(\\frac{T_b}{\\beta E_a}\\right) = \\frac{1}{T_e} - \\frac{T_b}{\\beta T_e^2}$$\n    Using $T_e = T_b(1 - 1/\\beta) = T_b\\frac{\\beta-1}{\\beta}$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E_a}\\left(\\frac{E_a}{T_e}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta}{T_b(\\beta-1)} - \\frac{T_b}{\\beta \\left(T_b\\frac{\\beta-1}{\\beta}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\beta}{T_b(\\beta-1)} - \\frac{T_b \\beta^2}{\\beta T_b^2(\\beta-1)^2} = \\frac{\\beta}{T_b(\\beta-1)} - \\frac{\\beta}{T_b(\\beta-1)^2}$$\n    $$= \\frac{\\beta(\\beta-1) - \\beta}{T_b(\\beta-1)^2} = \\frac{\\beta^2 - 2\\beta}{T_b(\\beta-1)^2} = \\frac{\\beta(\\beta - 2)}{T_b(\\beta - 1)^2}$$\n    Finally, we obtain the sensitivity:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial E_a} = -S_L \\frac{1}{2R} \\frac{\\beta(\\beta - 2)}{T_b(\\beta - 1)^2}$$\n\nThe computational algorithm is as follows:\nFor each given parameter set $(A, E_a, m, p)$:\n1.
