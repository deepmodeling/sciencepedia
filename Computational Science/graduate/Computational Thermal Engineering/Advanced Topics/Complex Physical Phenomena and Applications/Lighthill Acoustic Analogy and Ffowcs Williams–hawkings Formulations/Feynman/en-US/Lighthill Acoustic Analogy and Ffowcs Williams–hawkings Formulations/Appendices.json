            "problem": "A rigid body of characteristic length $a$ moves through a quiescent fluid of density $\\rho_{0}$ and sound speed $c_{0}$, generating an unsteady turbulent wake with characteristic velocity scale $U$ and dominant unsteady frequency scale $\\omega \\sim U/a$. An observer is located at a distance $r$ such that $r \\gg a$. Consider the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (FW-H) acoustic analogy formulated on a permeable spherical control surface $S_{p}$ of radius $R_{s}$, where $a \\ll R_{s} \\ll r$, and assume that the flow outside $S_{p}$ is irrotational with negligible Reynolds stress and vorticity magnitude compared to the turbulent wake inside $S_{p}$.\n\nStarting from the Lighthill acoustic analogy and the definition of the Lighthill stress tensor $T_{ij}$ through the Navier–Stokes equations, perform a multipole scaling analysis of the radiated acoustic pressure in the far field.

            "solution": "The problem requires a multipole scaling analysis of the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (FW-H) acoustic analogy to justify the conditions under which the volume quadrupole source term may be neglected in favor of the surface monopole and dipole terms, and to quantify the resulting fractional error in the far-field acoustic pressure.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\n#### Step 1.1: Extract Givens\n- A rigid body of characteristic length $a$.\n- A quiescent fluid of ambient density $\\rho_{0}$ and sound speed $c_{0}$.\n- An unsteady turbulent wake generated by the body with characteristic velocity scale $U$ and dominant unsteady frequency scale $\\omega \\sim U/a$.\n- An observer at a far-field distance $r$ such that $r \\gg a$.\n- A permeable spherical control surface $S_{p}$ of radius $R_{s}$ is used for the FW-H formulation.\n- The hierarchy of length scales is $a \\ll R_{s} \\ll r$.\n- The flow outside the control surface $S_{p}$ is irrotational with negligible Reynolds stress and vorticity.\n- The analysis is based on the Lighthill acoustic analogy, with the Lighthill stress tensor $T_{ij}$ scaling as $T_{ij} \\sim \\rho_{0} u_{i} u_{j}$ in turbulent regions.\n- The analysis is for low Mach number, $M \\equiv U/c_{0} \\ll 1$.\n- The source is compact, satisfying the far-field condition $r \\gg a$ and unsteady condition with characteristic time scale $\\tau \\sim a/U$.\n- The Lighthill stress tensor $T_{ij}$ is assumed to be negligible outside the control surface $S_{p}$.\n\n#### Step 1.2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, being based on the well-established Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings acoustic analogy, a cornerstone of aeroacoustics. The physical scalings for turbulent flow at low Mach number are standard. The setup, involving a permeable control surface to separate the nonlinear hydrodynamic near-field from the linear acoustic far-field, is a common and valid technique in computational aeroacoustics. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information and clear constraints (e.g., $M \\ll 1$, $a \\ll R_s \\ll r$) to perform the required scaling analysis. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles and is directly relevant to the specified topic. All checklist items for validity are satisfied.\n\n#### Step 1.3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\nThe Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings equation is an exact rearrangement of the Navier-Stokes equations into the form of an inhomogeneous wave equation. For a stationary, permeable control surface $S_p$ enclosing a volume $V$ that contains all significant acoustic sources (as per the given that $T_{ij}$ is negligible outside $S_p$), the solution for the acoustic pressure perturbation $p'(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ in the far field ($r \\to \\infty$) can be written as the sum of two contributions: a surface integral term $p'_S$ and a volume integral term $p'_V$.\n$$ p'(\\mathbf{x}, t) = p'_{S}(\\mathbf{x}, t) + p'_{V}(\\mathbf{x}, t) $$\nThe surface term $p'_{S}$ arises from the flux of mass and momentum across $S_p$, while the volume term $p'_{V}$ arises from the Lighthill stress tensor $T_{ij}$ within the volume $V$. In the far field, these contributions are given by:\n$$ p'_{S}(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\approx \\frac{1}{4\\pi r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{S_p} [\\rho_0 u_n]_{\\tau_e} dS + \\frac{\\hat{r}_i}{4\\pi c_0 r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{S_p} [P_{ij} n_j]_{\\tau_e} dS $$\n$$ p'_{V}(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\approx \\frac{\\hat{r}_i \\hat{r}_j}{4\\pi c_0^2 r} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\int_V [T_{ij}]_{\\tau_e} dV $$\nHere, $u_n$ is the fluid velocity component normal to $S_p$, $P_{ij} = (p-p_0)\\delta_{ij} + \\rho u_i u_j$ is the compressive stress tensor (neglecting viscous terms, which are sub-dominant for sound generation at high Reynolds numbers), $\\hat{r}_i$ are the components of the unit vector pointing from the source region to the observer, and $[\\cdot]_{\\tau_e}$ denotes evaluation at the emission time $\\tau_e = t - |\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|/c_0 \\approx t-r/c_0$ for a compact source region. The volume integral for $p'_{V}$ is over the volume $V$ inside $S_p$.\n\nWe are asked to find the condition under which $p'_{V}$ can be neglected and to quantify the fractional error. This requires a scaling analysis of each term. The characteristic scales are: velocity $U$, length $a$, time $a/U$, frequency $\\omega \\sim U/a$, and density $\\rho_0$.\n\n**1. Scaling of the Volume Quadrupole Contribution ($p'_{V}$)**\n\nThe volume integral term represents sound generated by the turbulent fluctuations within the volume $V$. The characteristic source volume is that of the turbulent wake, which scales with $a^3$. The Lighthill stress tensor scales as $T_{ij} \\sim \\rho_0 U^2$. The second-order time derivative scales as $\\partial^2/\\partial t^2 \\sim \\omega^2 \\sim (U/a)^2$.\nThe amplitude of the volume contribution thus scales as:\n$$ |p'_{V}| \\sim \\frac{1}{c_0^2 r} \\left(\\frac{U}{a}\\right)^2 (\\rho_0 U^2) a^3 = \\frac{\\rho_0 U^4 a}{c_0^2 r} $$\nExpressing this in terms of the Mach number $M = U/c_0$:\n$$ |p'_{V}| \\sim \\frac{\\rho_0 U^2 a}{r} \\left(\\frac{U^2}{c_0^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\rho_0 U^2 a}{r} M^2 $$\nThis is the classic scaling for quadrupole sound sources, which dominate in free turbulence.\n\n**2. Scaling of the Surface Contributions ($p'_{S}$)**\n\nThe problem specifies that the unsteady turbulent wake is generated by a rigid body. The interaction between the fluid and the body produces unsteady forces. According to Curle's extension of Lighthill's theory, unsteady forces on the fluid act as acoustic dipoles. This is a much more efficient sound generation mechanism than free turbulence quadrupoles. The dipole nature of the source dictates the scaling of the total acoustic field. The net force $F_i$ exerted by the fluid on the body (and by extension, the unsteady force acting on the fluid within volume $V$) scales with dynamic pressure and area: $F_i \\sim \\rho_0 U^2 a^2$.\nThe total acoustic pressure from a dipole source in the far field scales as:\n$$ |p'_{total}| \\sim \\frac{1}{c_0 r} \\left|\\frac{\\partial F_i}{\\partial t}\\right| \\sim \\frac{\\omega |F_i|}{c_0 r} \\sim \\frac{(U/a)(\\rho_0 U^2 a^2)}{c_0 r} = \\frac{\\rho_0 U^3 a}{c_0 r} = \\frac{\\rho_0 U^2 a}{r} M $$\nSince the FW-H formulation is an exact representation, the sum of its parts must yield this total pressure scaling: $|p'_{S} + p'_{V}| \\sim M$.\nWe have already found that $|p'_{V}| \\sim M^2$. For the sum to scale as $M$ (given $M \\ll 1$), the surface term $|p'_{S}|$ must scale as $M$.\n$$ |p'_{S}| \\sim \\frac{\\rho_0 U^2 a}{r} M $$\nThis is consistent with the leading-order term in $p'_{S}$ being its dipole component, which represents the net force on the fluid inside the control surface. The monopole component of $p'_{S}$, representing mass fluctuations inside $V$, scales as $\\rho_0 \\delta \\rho \\sim \\rho_0 M^2$ for isentropic fluctuations, leading to a monopole sound pressure contribution of order $|p'_{mono}| \\sim \\frac{\\rho_0 U^2 a}{r} M^2$. Thus, for low Mach numbers, the dipole contribution to the surface integral dominates, i.e., $|p'_{S}| \\approx |p'_{di}|$.\n\n**3. Justification for Neglecting the Quadrupole Contribution**\n\nWe compare the magnitude of the volume quadrupole contribution $p'_{V}$ to that of the dominant surface contribution $p'_{S}$.\n$$ \\frac{|p'_{V}|}{|p'_{S}|} \\sim \\frac{\\frac{\\rho_0 U^2 a}{r} M^2}{\\frac{\\rho_0 U^2 a}{r} M} = M $$\nSince the Mach number is small ($M \\ll 1$), we have $|p'_{V}| \\ll |p'_{S}|$. Therefore, the volume quadrupole contribution may be neglected in favor of the surface contributions. This approximation is valid whenever the sound generation is dominated by unsteady forces (dipole sources), which is the case for low-Mach-number flow over a body, as opposed to free turbulence. The condition for neglecting the quadrupole term is $M \\ll 1$.\n\n**4. Quantification of Fractional Error**\n\nThe total acoustic pressure is $p'_{total} = p'_{S} + p'_{V}$. By neglecting the volume contribution, we are making the approximation $p'_{approx} = p'_{S}$. The absolute error is $|p'_{total} - p'_{approx}| = |p'_{V}|$. The fractional error $\\epsilon$ is the ratio of the absolute error to the magnitude of the total pressure:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{|p'_{V}|}{|p'_{total}|} = \\frac{|p'_{V}|}{|p'_{S} + p'_{V}|} $$\nFor low Mach number ($M \\ll 1$), we have established that $|p'_{V}| \\ll |p'_{S}|$. Therefore, the denominator can be approximated by the leading-order term:\n$$ |p'_{S} + p'_{V}| \\approx |p'_{S}| $$\nThe fractional error is then:\n$$ \\epsilon \\approx \\frac{|p'_{V}|}{|p'_{S}|} $$\nOur scaling analysis showed this ratio to be of order $M$. The proportionality constants related to source directivity and geometry are expected to be of order unity and cancel out in the leading-order scaling of the ratio. Thus, the fractional error is directly proportional to the Mach number.\n$$ \\epsilon \\sim M $$\nThe problem asks for a single closed-form expression. Based on the fundamental scaling of multipole orders, this relationship is taken to be an equality for the leading-order analysis.\n$$ \\epsilon = M $$",

            "solution": "The user-provided problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard problem in computational aeroacoustics that is formalizable and solvable using established principles. All necessary data are provided, and the constraints are consistent and physically realistic. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, the derivation of the governing equation for the far-field acoustic pressure, and second, the development of a numerical algorithm to evaluate this equation.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Far-Field Acoustic Pressure\n\nThe physical problem is the calculation of sound radiated by a stationary, rigid plate subjected to fluctuating surface pressure loading. The starting point for this analysis is the acoustic analogy, specifically Curle's extension of Lighthill's theory to include solid boundaries. For a low Mach number flow over a stationary, impermeable surface, the acoustic pressure $p'(\\mathbf{x}_o,t)$ at an observer location $\\mathbf{x}_o$ and time $t$ can be expressed as the sum of thickness noise and loading noise.\n\nThe thickness noise, which arises from the displacement of fluid by the moving surface, is zero for a stationary surface as given in the problem statement.\n\nThe loading noise, which arises from the force the surface exerts on the fluid, is the dominant source. The general expression for loading noise from a stationary surface $S$ is given by Curle's integral:\n$$\np'(\\mathbf{x}_o, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_S \\left( \\frac{[\\dot{p}']_{t_r}}{r c_0} (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) + \\frac{[p']_{t_r}}{r^2} (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) \\right) dS(\\mathbf{x}_s)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_s$ is a point on the surface $S$, $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{x}_o - \\mathbf{x}_s$ is the vector from the source point to the observer, $r = \\lVert\\mathbf{r}\\rVert$, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = \\mathbf{r}/r$. The pressure fluctuation on the surface is $p'(\\mathbf{x}_s, t)$, and the notation $[\\cdot]_{t_r}$ indicates evaluation at the retarded time $t_r = t - r/c_0$. The speed of sound is $c_0$, and $\\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector on the surface, pointing into the fluid domain. The time derivative is denoted by $\\dot{p}'$.\n\nThe first term in the integrand, proportional to $1/r$, dominates in the far-field (where $r \\gg \\lambda$, with $\\lambda$ being the acoustic wavelength), while the second term, proportional to $1/r^2$, is a near-field hydrodynamic effect. As the problem requests a \"computable far-field expression\", we retain only the dominant far-field term:\n$$\np'(\\mathbf{x}_o, t) \\approx \\frac{1}{4\\pi c_0} \\int_S \\frac{(\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}})}{r} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial p(\\mathbf{x}_s, t)}{\\partial t} \\right]_{t_r} dS(\\mathbf{x}_s)\n$$\nHere, we have replaced the pressure fluctuation $p'$ with the total surface pressure $p$, as the time derivative of the ambient pressure is zero.\n\nFor the specified geometry, the plate lies in the $z=0$ plane, and its normal vector is $\\mathbf{n} = (0, 0, 1)$. An observer at $\\mathbf{x}_o = (x_o, y_o, z_o)$ and a source point at $\\mathbf{x}_s = (x_s, y_s, 0)$ give the vector $\\mathbf{r} = (x_o - x_s, y_o - y_s, z_o)$. The dot product $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}$ is simply $z_o$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = z_o/r$. Substituting this into the far-field expression gives the formula to be implemented:\n$$\np'(\\mathbf{x}_o, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi c_0} \\int_S \\frac{z_o}{r(\\mathbf{x}_s)^2} \\left. \\frac{\\partial p(\\mathbf{x}_s, \\tau)}{\\partial \\tau} \\right|_{\\tau=t_r} dS(\\mathbf{x}_s)\n$$\nThis expression is valid under the following assumptions:\n1.  The observer is in the acoustic far-field of the source plate.\n2.  The flow generating the pressure is of low Mach number.\n3.  The plate is stationary, rigid, and impermeable.\n4.  The surrounding medium is a uniform fluid at rest.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Evaluation Algorithm\n\nThe integral derived above is evaluated numerically as specified.\n\n**Surface Discretization:** The rectangular plate of area $L_x \\times L_y$ is discretized into a grid of $N_x \\times N_y$ smaller rectangular elements. Each element has an area of $\\Delta S = (L_x/N_x) \\cdot (L_y/L_y)$. The surface integral is approximated using the midpoint quadrature rule, which replaces the integral with a summation over all elements, evaluating the integrand at the center of each element. The element center coordinates are $\\mathbf{x}_{s,ij}$ for $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N_x-1\\}$ and $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, N_y-1\\}$.\n\nThe integral formula thus becomes the discrete sum:\n$$\np'(\\mathbf{x}_o, t) \\approx \\frac{\\Delta S}{4\\pi c_0} \\sum_{i=0}^{N_x-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{N_y-1} \\frac{z_o}{r_{ij}^2} \\left. \\frac{\\partial p(\\mathbf{x}_{s,ij}, \\tau)}{\\partial \\tau} \\right|_{\\tau=t_{r,ij}}\n$$\nwhere $r_{ij} = \\lVert \\mathbf{x}_o - \\mathbf{x}_{s,ij} \\rVert$ and $t_{r,ij} = t - r_{ij}/c_0$. The problem states that the pressure is spatially uniform on the plate, i.e., $p(\\mathbf{x}_s, t) = p(t)$, further simplifying the evaluation.\n\n**Numerical Differentiation:** The time derivative $\\partial p / \\partial \\tau$ is computed numerically using a second-order symmetric finite difference scheme. For a function $p(\\tau)$ known at discrete times with spacing $T_s = 1/f_s$, the derivative at an arbitrary time $\\tau$ is approximated as:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{d\\tau} \\approx \\frac{p(\\tau + h) - p(\\tau - h)}{2h}\n$$\nA suitable choice for the step size is $h = T_s$. The required pressure values $p(\\tau + T_s)$ and $p(\\tau - T_s)$ are obtained via linear interpolation from the discrete samples provided at a uniform sampling frequency $f_s$, as the evaluation times $t_{r,ij} \\pm T_s$ do not generally coincide with sample points.\n\n### Part 3: Sampling Frequency Criterion\n\nTo reliably capture a signal with a maximum frequency content of $f_{\\max}$, the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states that the sampling frequency $f_s$ must be greater than twice this maximum frequency, i.e., $f_s > 2 f_{\\max}$. This assumes an ideal \"brick-wall\" anti-aliasing filter. Practical filters have a non-zero transition band between the passband and stopband.\n\nLet the passband edge be $f_p = f_{\\max}$. To prevent aliasing, the stopband edge, $f_{stop}$, must be no higher than the Nyquist frequency, $f_s/2$. The problem specifies a fractional transition margin $\\eta$. We interpret this as defining the width of the transition band relative to the maximum frequency of interest, such that the transition bandwidth is $\\eta f_{\\max}$.\n\nTherefore, the stopband begins at $f_{stop} = f_p + \\eta f_{\\max} = f_{\\max}(1 + \\eta)$. The condition to prevent aliasing is $f_{stop} \\le f_s/2$. This leads to the following criterion for the recommended minimum sampling frequency, $f_{s,\\mathrm{rec}}$:\n$$\nf_{\\max}(1 + \\eta) \\le \\frac{f_s}{2} \\implies f_s \\ge 2 f_{\\max}(1 + \\eta)\n$$\nThus, we define the recommended sampling frequency as:\n$$\nf_{s,\\mathrm{rec}} = 2 f_{\\max}(1 + \\eta)\n$$\nA given sampling frequency $f_s$ is sufficient if $f_s \\ge f_{s,\\mathrm{rec}}$.",
