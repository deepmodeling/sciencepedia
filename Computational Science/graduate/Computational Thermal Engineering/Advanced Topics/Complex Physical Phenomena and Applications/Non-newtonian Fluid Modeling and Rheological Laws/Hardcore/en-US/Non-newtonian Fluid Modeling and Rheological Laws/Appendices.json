They are physically reasonable in the appropriate limits.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nWe begin by considering the kinematics of a steady, fully developed planar Couette flow. The velocity field is assumed to have the form $\\boldsymbol{u} = (u(y), 0, 0)$. This form inherently satisfies the incompressibility condition $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$, since $u$ depends only on $y$.\n\nThe velocity gradient tensor $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}$ is:\n$$ \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{du}{dy}  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet $\\dot{\\gamma}(y) = \\frac{du}{dy}$ be the shear rate. The rate-of-deformation tensor $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{D} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} + (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u})^{\\top}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\dot{\\gamma}  0 \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe momentum equation under creeping flow conditions and with no body forces is $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. Substituting $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\boldsymbol{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, we get $-\\nabla p + \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. In component form:\n$x$-component: $-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yx}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{zx}}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n$y$-component: $-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xy}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yy}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{zy}}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n$z$-component: $-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yz}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{zz}}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n\nGiven the flow is a function of $y$ only, and $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}=0$ is specified, the $x$-momentum equation simplifies significantly to:\n$$ \\frac{d \\tau_{yx}}{dy} = 0 $$\nThis implies that the shear stress $\\tau_{yx}$ (and by symmetry, $\\tau_{xy}$) is constant across the fluid layer.\n\nNext, we analyze the constitutive equation for the polymeric stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p} + \\lambda \\,\\overset{\\triangledown}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{p} = 2 \\eta_{p} \\boldsymbol{D}$. For steady flow ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$) where velocity and stress depend only on $y$, the advection term in the upper-convected derivative is $\\boldsymbol{u}\\cdot\\nabla \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p} = u(y)\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_p}{\\partial x} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. The UCM equation becomes:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p} - \\lambda \\left( (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}) \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p} (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u})^{\\top} \\right) = 2 \\eta_{p} \\boldsymbol{D} $$\nThe term in the parenthesis is computed as follows:\n$$ (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}) \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p} (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u})^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\dot{\\gamma}  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\dot{\\gamma}\\tau_{p,xy}  \\dot{\\gamma}\\tau_{p,yy}  \\dot{\\gamma}\\tau_{p,yz} \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma}\\tau_{p,yy}  0  0 \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma}\\tau_{p,yz}  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWriting the UCM equation component-wise:\n1. $(xx)$: $\\tau_{p,xx} - \\lambda(2\\dot{\\gamma}\\tau_{p,xy}) = 2\\eta_{p}D_{xx} = 0$\n2. $(yy)$: $\\tau_{p,yy} - \\lambda(0) = 2\\eta_{p}D_{yy} = 0 \\implies \\tau_{p,yy} = 0$\n3. $(zz)$: $\\tau_{p,zz} - \\lambda(0) = 2\\eta_{p}D_{zz} = 0 \\implies \\tau_{p,zz} = 0$\n4. $(xy)$: $\\tau_{p,xy} - \\lambda(\\dot{\\gamma}\\tau_{p,yy}) = 2\\eta_{p}D_{xy} = \\eta_{p}\\dot{\\gamma}$\n5. $(xz)$: $\\tau_{p,xz} - \\lambda(\\dot{\\gamma}\\tau_{p,yz}) = 2\\eta_{p}D_{xz} = 0$\n6. $(yz)$: $\\tau_{p,yz} - \\lambda(0) = 2\\eta_{p}D_{yz} = 0 \\implies \\tau_{p,yz} = 0$\n\nFrom these equations, we solve for the non-zero components of $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_p$. From $(6)$, $\\tau_{p,yz}=0$. Substituting into $(5)$, we get $\\tau_{p,xz}=0$. From $(2)$, $\\tau_{p,yy}=0$. Substituting this into $(4)$, we find the polymeric shear stress:\n$$ \\tau_{p,xy} = \\eta_{p}\\dot{\\gamma} $$\nSubstituting this result into $(1)$, we find the polymeric normal stress in the flow direction:\n$$ \\tau_{p,xx} = 2\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}\\tau_{p,xy} = 2\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}(\\eta_{p}\\dot{\\gamma}) = 2\\eta_{p}\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}^{2} $$\nSo the polymeric stress tensor is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\eta_{p}\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}^{2}  \\eta_{p}\\dot{\\gamma}  0 \\\\ \\eta_{p}\\dot{\\gamma}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe total extra stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the sum of the solvent and polymeric parts, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = 2\\eta_{s}\\boldsymbol{D} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{p}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\eta_s \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\dot{\\gamma}  0 \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\eta_{p}\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}^{2}  \\eta_{p}\\dot{\\gamma}  0 \\\\ \\eta_{p}\\dot{\\gamma}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\eta_{p}\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}^{2}  (\\eta_{s} + \\eta_{p})\\dot{\\gamma}  0 \\\\ (\\eta_{s} + \\eta_{p})\\dot{\\gamma}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFrom this, the total shear stress is $\\tau_{xy} = (\\eta_{s} + \\eta_{p})\\dot{\\gamma}$. As established from the momentum equation, $\\tau_{xy}$ must be constant. Since $\\eta_{s}$ and $\\eta_{p}$ are constants, the shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma} = du/dy$ must also be constant.\nLet's call this constant shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}_0$. Then $du/dy = \\dot{\\gamma}_0$. Integrating with respect to $y$ gives the velocity profile:\n$$ u(y) = \\dot{\\gamma}_0 y + C $$\nWe apply the no-slip boundary conditions to find the constants $\\dot{\\gamma}_0$ and $C$:\n$u(0) = 0 \\implies \\dot{\\gamma}_0(0) + C = 0 \\implies C=0$.\n$u(H) = U \\implies \\dot{\\gamma}_0 H = U \\implies \\dot{\\gamma}_0 = \\frac{U}{H}$.\nThe velocity profile is linear, just as for a Newtonian fluid:\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{U}{H} y $$\nThe constant shear rate across the gap is $\\dot{\\gamma} = U/H$.\n\nNow we can write the final expressions for the stresses by substituting $\\dot{\\gamma} = U/H$.\nThe total shear stress $\\tau_{xy}$ is:\n$$ \\tau_{xy} = (\\eta_{s} + \\eta_{p})\\dot{\\gamma} = (\\eta_{s} + \\eta_{p})\\frac{U}{H} $$\nThe non-zero normal stress component is:\n$$ \\tau_{xx} = 2\\eta_{p}\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}^{2} = 2\\eta_{p}\\lambda\\left(\\frac{U}{H}\\right)^{2} $$\nThe other diagonal components are $\\tau_{yy} = 0$ and $\\tau_{zz} = 0$.\n\nFinally, we compute the normal stress differences:\nThe first normal stress difference $N_1$ is:\n$$ N_{1} = \\tau_{xx} - \\tau_{yy} = 2\\eta_{p}\\lambda\\left(\\frac{U}{H}\\right)^{2} - 0 = 2\\eta_{p}\\lambda\\left(\\frac{U}{H}\\right)^{2} $$\nThe second normal stress difference $N_2$ is:\n$$ N_{2} = \\tau_{yy} - \\tau_{zz} = 0 - 0 = 0 $$\nThe zero second normal stress difference is a characteristic prediction of the UCM and Oldroyd-B models for simple shear flows.\n\nThe final answers are the derived expressions for $u(y)$, $\\tau_{xy}$, $N_1$, and $N_2$.",

Wall Slip Correction and No-Slip Shear Rate\n\nWith wall slip, the total volumetric flow rate $Q$ is the sum of a contribution from the shear flow of the bulk fluid and a contribution from the plug-like flow due to the slip velocity $u_s$ at the wall. This relationship is captured by the Mooney equation. The equation relates the apparent wall shear rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}_{aw}$, to the slip velocity $u_s$ and the die diameter $D$. The apparent wall shear rate is defined as:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_{aw} = \\frac{32Q}{\\pi D^3} $$\nThe Mooney equation is:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_{aw} = \\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}} + \\frac{8 u_s}{D} $$\nHere, $\\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}}$ is the apparent wall shear rate that would be measured in the absence of slip. Since the wall shear stress $\\tau_w$ is the same for both dies, the material-dependent functions $\\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}}(\\tau_w)$ and $u_s(\\tau_w)$ are also the same. This allows us to use the data from the two dies to solve for these quantities.\n\nFirst, we calculate the apparent wall shear rates for each die.\nFor Die A (index $1$):\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_{aw,1} = \\frac{32 Q_1}{\\pi D_1^3} = \\frac{32 \\cdot (0.20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}})}{\\pi (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3} = \\frac{6.4 \\times 10^{-6}}{\\pi \\times 10^{-9}}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = \\frac{6400}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\n\nFor Die B (index $2$):\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_{aw,2} = \\frac{32 Q_2}{\\pi D_2^3} = \\frac{32 \\cdot (1.20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}})}{\\pi (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3} = \\frac{38.4 \\times 10^{-6}}{\\pi \\cdot 8.0 \\times 10^{-9}}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = \\frac{4800}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations in $\\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}}$ and $u_s$:\n$$ \\frac{6400}{\\pi} = \\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}} + \\frac{8 u_s}{D_1} $$\n$$ \\frac{4800}{\\pi} = \\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}} + \\frac{8 u_s}{D_2} $$\nBy plotting $\\dot{\\gamma}_{aw}$ versus $1/D$, $\\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}}$ is the intercept. Algebraically, we can solve for it by eliminating $u_s$:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}} = \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}_{aw,2}D_2 - \\dot{\\gamma}_{aw,1}D_1}{D_2 - D_1} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}} = \\frac{(\\frac{4800}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}) - (\\frac{6400}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}} $$\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}} = \\frac{\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\pi}(4800 \\cdot 2 - 6400 \\cdot 1)}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = \\frac{9600 - 6400}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = \\frac{3200}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\nThis is the \"no-slip wall shear rate\" requested, which is more precisely termed the slip-corrected apparent wall shear rate.\n\n3. Viscosity Evaluation\n\nThe shear viscosity, $\\eta$, is defined as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate, $\\eta(\\dot{\\gamma}) = \\tau_w / \\dot{\\gamma}_w$. The shear rate we have calculated, $\\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}}$, is an *apparent* rate. For a non-Newtonian fluid, the true wall shear rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}_w$, is related to the apparent rate by the Weissenberg-Rabinowitsch correction:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_w = \\frac{3n' + 1}{4n'}\\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad n' = \\frac{d(\\ln \\tau_w)}{d(\\ln \\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}})} $$\nTo calculate the correction factor, one needs data at multiple wall shear stresses to evaluate the derivative $n'$. The problem provides data at only a single value of $\\tau_w = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. It is therefore impossible to perform the Weissenberg-Rabinowitsch correction.\n\nGiven this limitation, the most reasonable interpretation of the problem is to calculate an apparent viscosity, $\\eta_a$, using the slip-corrected apparent shear rate. The problem asks to evaluate the viscosity \"at this wall shear rate,\" which refers to the value of $\\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}}$ just determined.\n$$ \\eta \\approx \\eta_a = \\frac{\\tau_w}{\\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}}} $$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$ \\tau_w = 3.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_{aw, \\text{no-slip}} = \\frac{3200}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{\\frac{3200}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^5 \\cdot \\pi}{3200}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s} = \\frac{3000\\pi}{32}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s} = \\frac{375\\pi}{4}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\eta \\approx 294.524\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the final value for the viscosity is $295\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$.",

Let the coordinate $y$ denote the transverse direction with $y=0$ at the mid-plane and $y=H$ at the wall. The walls are maintained at a uniform temperature $T_w$ and there is no axial heat conduction. The flow is driven by a constant streamwise pressure gradient $dp/dx$ such that the positive constant $G$ is defined by $G=-dp/dx0$. Assume one-dimensional heat transfer across $y$ with viscous dissipation.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Conservation of linear momentum for fully developed planar flow gives the shear stress distribution $d\\tau_{yx}/dy=dp/dx$. With symmetry condition $\\tau_{yx}(0)=0$ and $G=-dp/dx>0$, this implies that the shear stress component is $\\tau_{yx}(y) = -Gy$. For the power-law model and dissipation calculation, we use the magnitude of the shear stress over the half-channel $y\\in[0,H]$, which is $\\tau(y)=Gy$.\n- The generalized Newtonian power-law (Ostwald–de Waele) rheological law states $\\tau = m \\lvert \\dot{\\gamma} \\rvert^{n-1} \\dot{\\gamma}$, where $m$ is the consistency index and $n$ is the flow behavior index, and the shear rate is $\\dot{\\gamma} = du/dy$.\n- The viscous dissipation volumetric heat generation term is $\\Phi = \\tau \\, \\dot{\\gamma}$, which is strictly nonnegative for real flows.\n- The steady-state energy equation with no axial conduction and no internal heat sources other than viscous dissipation for one-dimensional heat transfer is $k \\, d^2 T/dy^2 + \\Phi(y) = 0$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity and $T(y)$ is the temperature field, subject to $dT/dy(0)=0$ by symmetry and $T(H)=T_w$ by wall isothermal boundary condition.\n- The objective is to estimate the wall heat flux $q_w = -k \\, (dT/dy)\\rvert_{y=H}$ in $\\text{W/m}^2$.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using the fundamental relations above, express the viscous dissipation $\\Phi(y)$ for a shear-thinning power-law fluid ($n1$) over $y\\in[0,H]$ in terms of $G$, $m$, $n$, and $y$. Similarly, express the Newtonian baseline dissipation when the dynamic viscosity is $\\mu_N$.\n2. Numerically integrate the energy equation across the half-channel $y\\in[0,H]$ to obtain the wall heat flux $q_w$ for the shear-thinning fluid. The numerical procedure must discretize the interval $[0,H]$ uniformly, evaluate the source term $\\Phi(y)$, and compute the integral needed to obtain $q_w$ from the solution. Repeat for the Newtonian baseline.\n3.

A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to determine the wall heat flux, $q_w$, for a power-law fluid and a Newtonian fluid under specified conditions. This requires first deriving the viscous dissipation function, $\\Phi(y)$, and then integrating it across the half-channel.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Viscous Dissipation Function $\\Phi(y)$**\nThe momentum balance for fully developed planar flow, driven by a pressure gradient $dp/dx = -G$, yields the shear stress profile. For the half-channel $y \\in [0, H]$, the true shear stress is $\\tau_{yx}(y) = (dp/dx)y = -Gy$. The problem defines $\\tau(y) = Gy$, which is best interpreted as the magnitude of the shear stress, i.e., $\\tau(y) = |\\tau_{yx}(y)| = Gy$.\n\nThe viscous dissipation term $\\Phi$ represents the rate of conversion of mechanical energy into internal energy per unit volume. It is defined as $\\Phi = \\tau_{ij} \\dot{\\gamma}_{ij}$, which for this one-dimensional flow simplifies to $\\Phi = \\tau_{yx} \\dot{\\gamma}$, where $\\dot{\\gamma} = du/dy$. Since $\\Phi$ must be non-negative, and both $\\tau_{yx}$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}$ are negative for $y>0$, their product is positive. We have $\\Phi = (-Gy)(-\\lvert\\dot{\\gamma}\\rvert) = Gy\\lvert\\dot{\\gamma}\\rvert = \\tau \\lvert\\dot{\\gamma}\\rvert$.\n\n**For the power-law fluid**:\nThe rheological law is $\\tau = m \\lvert \\dot{\\gamma} \\rvert^n$. We can solve for the magnitude of the shear rate:\n$$\n\\lvert \\dot{\\gamma} \\rvert = \\left( \\frac{\\tau}{m} \\right)^{1/n}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\tau(y) = Gy$:\n$$\n\\lvert \\dot{\\gamma}(y) \\rvert = \\left( \\frac{G y}{m} \\right)^{1/n}\n$$\nThe viscous dissipation function for the power-law (PL) fluid, $\\Phi_{PL}(y)$, is then:\n$$\n\\Phi_{PL}(y) = \\tau(y) \\lvert \\dot{\\gamma}(y) \\rvert = (G y) \\left( \\frac{G y}{m} \\right)^{1/n} = m^{-1/n} G^{1+1/n} y^{1+1/n}\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi_{PL}(y) = m^{-1/n} G^{(n+1)/n} y^{(n+1)/n}\n$$\n\n**For the Newtonian fluid**:\nA Newtonian fluid is a special case of the power-law model with $n=1$ and the consistency index $m$ equal to the dynamic viscosity, $m=\\mu_N$. Substituting these into the expression for $\\Phi_{PL}(y)$:\n$$\n\\Phi_N(y) = \\mu_N^{-1/1} G^{(1+1)/1} y^{(1+1)/1} = \\frac{G^2 y^2}{\\mu_N}\n$$\nThis is the standard expression for viscous dissipation in Newtonian planar Poiseuille flow.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Wall Heat Flux $q_w$**\nThe steady-state energy equation is given as $k \\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2} + \\Phi(y) = 0$. We can integrate this equation with respect to $y$.\n$$\n\\int_0^y \\frac{d}{dy'} \\left( k \\frac{dT}{dy'} \\right) dy' = - \\int_0^y \\Phi(y') dy'\n$$\n$$\nk \\frac{dT}{dy}(y) - k \\frac{dT}{dy}(0) = - \\int_0^y \\Phi(y') dy'\n$$\nUsing the symmetry boundary condition at the centerline, $dT/dy(0)=0$, we get:\n$$\nk \\frac{dT}{dy}(y) = - \\int_0^y \\Phi(y') dy'\n$$\nThe wall heat flux $q_w$ is defined as the heat flux from the wall into the fluid, $q_w = -k \\frac{dT}{dy}\\rvert_{y=H}$. Substituting the expression for the temperature gradient at $y=H$:\n$$\nq_w = - \\left( - \\int_0^H \\Phi(y') dy' \\right) = \\int_0^H \\Phi(y) dy\n$$\nThis result shows that the wall heat flux is equal to the total viscous heat generated in the half-channel per unit area. Notably, the calculation of $q_w$ does not depend on the thermal conductivity $k$ or the wall temperature $T_w$.\n\n**3. Numerical Integration Procedure**\nTo compute $q_w$, we must numerically evaluate the definite integral $\\int_0^H \\Phi(y) dy$ for both the power-law and Newtonian cases.\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  Discretize the domain $y \\in [0, H]$ into a large number of points, $y_i$, where $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N$.\n2.  At each point $y_i$, evaluate the integrand, which is the viscous dissipation function $\\Phi(y_i)$.\n3.  Use a numerical quadrature method, such as the trapezoidal rule, to approximate the integral. The trapezoidal rule approximates the integral as the sum of the areas of trapezoids formed by the function values at adjacent grid points.\n$$\nq_w \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{\\Phi(y_{i-1}) + \\Phi(y_i)}{2} (y_i - y_{i-1})\n$$\nThis calculation will be performed for $q_{w,PL} = \\int_0^H \\Phi_{PL}(y) dy$ and $q_{w,N} = \\int_0^H \\Phi_{N}(y) dy$. Finally, the ratio $r = q_{w,PL}/q_{w,N}$ is computed.\n\nAn analytical solution exists for verification:\n$$\nq_{w,PL} = \\int_0^H m^{-1/n} G^{(n+1)/n} y^{(n+1)/n} dy = \\frac{n}{2n+1} m^{-1/n} G^{(n+1)/n} H^{(2n+1)/n}\n$$\n$$\nq_{w,N} = \\int_0^H \\frac{G^2 y^2}{\\mu_N} dy = \\frac{G^2 H^3}{3\\mu_N}\n$$\nThe numerical implementation will adhere to the problem's request to perform numerical integration.",
