This allows for direct integration to the wall without the complex and often empirically-tuned damping functions required by other models, like the standard $k-\\varepsilon$ model. This exercise guides you through the fundamental asymptotic analysis that reveals this well-behaved nature, showing how the balance between viscous diffusion and dissipation in the $\\omega$-transport equation leads to a predictable scaling near the wall .
