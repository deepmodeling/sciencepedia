The problem is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Solution\nThe problem is valid. The solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Justification of viscous dominance at $y_1$.\nTo justify that the effects of molecular viscosity dominate over turbulent viscosity at the location $y_1$, we compute the ratio of the turbulent kinematic viscosity, $\\nu_t$, to the molecular kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the molecular kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, from the given dynamic viscosity, $\\mu$, and density, $\\rho$.\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho} = \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}}{1.20\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}} = 1.50 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the turbulent kinematic viscosity, $\\nu_t$, at the location $y_1$ using the provided $k–\\omega$ model relation and the given turbulence quantities.\n$$\n\\nu_t(y_1) = \\frac{k(y_1)}{\\omega(y_1)} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^2}}{6.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$\nNow, we find the ratio of the two viscosities.\n$$\n\\frac{\\nu_t(y_1)}{\\nu} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}}{1.50 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}} \\approx 1.333 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nSince this ratio is significantly less than $1$ (i.e., $\\nu_t \\ll \\nu$), the contribution of turbulent stresses to the total shear stress is negligible compared to the contribution of viscous (molecular) stresses. This confirms that the point $y_1$ is deep within the viscous sublayer, where viscous effects are dominant.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$.\nIn the viscous sublayer, the mean velocity profile is linear with respect to the distance from the wall, $y$. This is expressed as $u(y) \\approx (\\partial u/\\partial y)\\big|_{w}\\,y$. This approximation implies that the velocity gradient near the wall is constant and equal to its value at the wall. We can therefore approximate the wall gradient using the data at the first off-wall point, $y_1$, and the no-slip condition $u(0)=0$.\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_{w} \\approx \\frac{u(y_1) - u(0)}{y_1 - 0} = \\frac{u(y_1)}{y_1}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_{w} \\approx \\frac{1.44\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{1.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 1.2 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\nThe wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, is defined by the Newtonian constitutive relation evaluated at the wall.\n$$\n\\tau_w = \\mu \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_{w}\n$$\nUsing the computed gradient and the given dynamic viscosity:\n$$\n\\tau_w \\approx (1.80 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) = 2.16 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 0.216\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\n\nPart 3: Computation of the skin-friction coefficient, $C_f$.\nThe skin-friction coefficient, $C_f$, is defined as the wall shear stress non-dimensionalized by the free-stream dynamic pressure.\n$$\nC_f = \\frac{\\tau_w}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho U_{\\infty}^2}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the dynamic pressure term in the denominator.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\rho U_{\\infty}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (1.20\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}) \\times (30.0\\,\\mathrm{m/s})^2 = 0.60 \\times 900.0\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 540.0\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nNow, we can compute $C_f$ using the value of $\\tau_w$ calculated previously.\n$$\nC_f = \\frac{0.216\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{540.0\\,\\mathrm{Pa}} = 0.0004\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. In standard decimal form, this would be $0.000400$. Expressing this in scientific notation makes the precision unambiguous.\n$$\nC_f = 4.00 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nFinal Answer: The calculated skin-friction coefficient is $4.00 \\times 10^{-4}$.",

We now apply this to both models.\n\n**1. $\\varepsilon$-based model:**\nThe reaction coefficient is $r_{\\varepsilon}(y) = a\\,\\frac{\\nu}{y^{2}}$. Its maximum value is:\n$$\n\\max_y[r_{\\varepsilon}(y)] = r_{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta y}{2}\\right) = a \\frac{\\nu}{(\\Delta y/2)^2} = \\frac{4a\\nu}{(\\Delta y)^2}\n$$\nThe maximum stable time step is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max, \\varepsilon} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{4\\nu}{(\\Delta y)^2} + \\frac{4a\\nu}{(\\Delta y)^2}} = \\frac{2(\\Delta y)^2}{4\\nu(1+a)} = \\frac{(\\Delta y)^2}{2\\nu(1+a)}\n$$\n\n**2. $\\omega$-based model:**\nThe reaction coefficient is $r_{\\omega}(y) = b\\,\\frac{u_{\\tau}}{y}$. Its maximum value is:\n$$\n\\max_y[r_{\\omega}(y)] = r_{\\omega}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta y}{2}\\right) = b \\frac{u_{\\tau}}{(\\Delta y/2)} = \\frac{2b u_{\\tau}}{\\Delta y}\n$$\nThe maximum stable time step is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max, \\omega} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{4\\nu}{(\\Delta y)^2} + \\frac{2b u_{\\tau}}{\\Delta y}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{4\\nu + 2b u_{\\tau} \\Delta y}{(\\Delta y)^2}} = \\frac{2(\\Delta y)^2}{4\\nu + 2b u_{\\tau} \\Delta y} = \\frac{(\\Delta y)^2}{2\\nu + b u_{\\tau} \\Delta y}\n$$\n\n**3. Ratio R:**\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R = \\frac{\\Delta t_{\\max,\\omega}}{\\Delta t_{\\max,\\varepsilon}}$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{(\\Delta y)^2}{2\\nu + b u_{\\tau} \\Delta y}}{\\frac{(\\Delta y)^2}{2\\nu(1+a)}}\n$$\nBy canceling the $(\\Delta y)^2$ terms and inverting the denominator, we get:\n$$\nR = \\frac{2\\nu(1+a)}{2\\nu + b u_{\\tau} \\Delta y}\n$$\nThis expression provides the ratio of maximum stable time steps as a function of the given physical and numerical parameters. The significance of this result in CFD is that the stiffness of the near-wall reaction term in $\\omega$-based models scales with $1/\\Delta y$, whereas for $\\varepsilon$-based models it scales with $1/(\\Delta y)^2$. For fine grids ($\\Delta y \\to 0$), the time step restriction for $\\varepsilon$-based models becomes far more severe, which is a key advantage of $\\omega$-based models in near-wall regions.",
