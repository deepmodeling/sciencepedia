The first grid point (cell-center) is located at a wall-normal distance $y_{w}$ from the wall.\n\nFrom first principles, use the mean near-wall momentum balance and the concept of wall units to explain why the first-cell wall coordinate $y^{+}_{1}$ must be chosen sufficiently small to resolve the viscous sublayer when using a wall-resolved $k$–$\\omega$ model. In particular, starting from the definition of the friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$ in terms of the wall shear stress and density, the definition of the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, and the near-wall linear relation between mean velocity and wall-normal coordinate in the viscous sublayer, show how a quantitative upper bound on $y^{+}_{1}$ arises by demanding that the turbulent (eddy) viscosity be negligible compared to the molecular viscosity in the first cell.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of computational fluid dynamics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and stated using objective, formal language. It presents a standard pedagogical exercise in turbulence modeling.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested: a theoretical explanation followed by a numerical calculation.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires an explanation for why the first-cell wall coordinate, denoted $y_1^{+}$, must be sufficiently small for a wall-resolved $k$–$\\omega$ turbulence model. This explanation must be derived from first principles, demonstrating how the condition that turbulent viscosity is negligible compared to molecular viscosity in the first cell near the wall leads to a quantitative upper bound on $y_1^{+}$.\n\nWe begin by defining the key quantities. The wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, is related to the friction velocity, $u_{\\tau}$, and the fluid density, $\\rho$, by the definition:\n$$ \\tau_w \\equiv \\rho u_{\\tau}^2 $$\nThe wall-normal coordinate, $y$, can be non-dimensionalized using the viscous length scale, $\\delta_{\\nu} = \\nu / u_{\\tau}$, where $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. The dimensionless wall coordinate, $y^{+}$, is thus defined as:\n$$ y^{+} = \\frac{y}{ \\delta_{\\nu} } = \\frac{y u_{\\tau}}{\\nu} $$\n\nFor a steady, incompressible, two-dimensional turbulent boundary layer with a zero pressure gradient, the Reynolds-averaged momentum equation simplifies in the near-wall region. The total shear stress, $\\tau_{total}$, is approximately constant and equal to the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. This total stress is the sum of the molecular (viscous) shear stress and the turbulent (Reynolds) shear stress:\n$$ \\tau_{total} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}}{\\partial y} - \\rho \\overline{u'v'} \\approx \\tau_w $$\nHere, $\\bar{u}$ is the mean velocity parallel to the wall, $\\mu = \\rho \\nu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $-\\rho \\overline{u'v'}$ is the Reynolds stress. Using the Boussinesq hypothesis, the Reynolds stress is modeled in terms of an eddy viscosity, $\\nu_t$, as $-\\rho \\overline{u'v'} = \\rho \\nu_t \\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}}{\\partial y}$. Substituting this into the stress balance gives:\n$$ \\tau_w \\approx \\rho (\\nu + \\nu_t) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}}{\\partial y} $$\n\nThe region closest to the wall is the viscous sublayer, typically characterized by $y^{+}  5$. In this layer, viscous effects dominate over turbulent effects, which means the turbulent viscosity is much smaller than the molecular viscosity: $\\nu_t \\ll \\nu$. Applying this condition to the shear stress equation yields:\n$$ \\tau_w \\approx \\rho \\nu \\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}}{\\partial y} $$\nSubstituting $\\tau_w = \\rho u_{\\tau}^2$, we get:\n$$ \\rho u_{\\tau}^2 \\approx \\rho \\nu \\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}}{\\partial y} \\implies \\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}}{\\partial y} \\approx \\frac{u_{\\tau}^2}{\\nu} $$\nIntegrating this expression with respect to $y$ with the no-slip boundary condition $\\bar{u}(0) = 0$ gives the well-known linear velocity profile in the viscous sublayer:\n$$ \\bar{u}(y) = \\frac{u_{\\tau}^2}{\\nu} y $$\n\nThe problem requires the use of a mixing-length model for $\\nu_t$ to formalize the condition $\\nu_t \\ll \\nu$. Near a solid wall, the turbulent eddy viscosity can be approximated using a mixing length, $l_m$, which is proportional to the wall-normal distance, $y$. The model is $\\nu_t = l_m^2 |S|$, where $S$ is the magnitude of the mean strain rate tensor. For the boundary layer flow, this is approximated as $|S| \\approx |\\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}}{\\partial y}|$. The mixing length is given by $l_m = \\kappa y$, where $\\kappa$ is the von Kármán constant (approximately $0.41$).\nTherefore, the eddy viscosity is modeled as:\n$$ \\nu_t \\approx (\\kappa y)^2 \\left| \\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}}{\\partial y} \\right| $$\nWithin the viscous sublayer, we can substitute the expression for the mean velocity gradient, $\\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}}{\\partial y} \\approx \\frac{u_{\\tau}^2}{\\nu}$, into the model for $\\nu_t$:\n$$ \\nu_t \\approx (\\kappa y)^2 \\frac{u_{\\tau}^2}{\\nu} $$\n\nA wall-resolved simulation requires that the first computational cell, centered at $y_w$, is located deep inside the viscous sublayer. The fundamental assumption of the sublayer is that molecular viscosity dominates. We express this condition as $\\nu_t \\ll \\nu$ at $y = y_w$. Substituting our expression for $\\nu_t$ at $y_w$, we obtain the inequality:\n$$ (\\kappa y_w)^2 \\frac{u_{\\tau}^2}{\\nu} \\ll \\nu $$\nRearranging this inequality to isolate terms involving $y_w$:\n$$ \\kappa^2 y_w^2 u_{\\tau}^2 \\ll \\nu^2 $$\n$$ \\kappa^2 \\left( \\frac{y_w u_{\\tau}}{\\nu} \\right)^2 \\ll 1 $$\nRecognizing the dimensionless wall coordinate of the first cell, $y_1^{+} = \\frac{y_w u_{\\tau}}{\\nu}$, we arrive at the final relationship:\n$$ \\kappa^2 (y_1^{+})^2 \\ll 1 $$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find the quantitative upper bound on $y_1^{+}$:\n$$ \\kappa y_1^{+} \\ll 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y_1^{+} \\ll \\frac{1}{\\kappa} $$\nSince $\\kappa \\approx 0.41$, this implies $y_1^{+} \\ll 2.44$. This derivation shows from first principles that for the turbulent viscosity to be negligible in the first computational cell, its dimensionless wall distance $y_1^{+}$ must be significantly smaller than $1$. The commonly used engineering practice of requiring $y_1^{+} \\le 1$ ensures that this condition is robustly met and the first grid point lies well within the region where the linear velocity profile is a valid approximation.\n\nThe second part of the problem is a numerical calculation. We are given:\nFriction velocity, $u_{\\tau} = 0.47\\ \\text{m}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nKinematic viscosity, $\\nu = 1.6 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nFirst-cell distance from the wall, $y_{w} = 12\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 12 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}$.\n\nThe wall coordinate $y^{+}$ at this location is calculated using its definition:\n$$ y^{+} = \\frac{y_{w} u_{\\tau}}{\\nu} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ y^{+} = \\frac{(12 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}) \\times (0.47\\ \\text{m}\\ \\text{s}^{-1})}{1.6 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} $$\n$$ y^{+} = \\frac{12 \\times 0.47}{1.6} \\times \\frac{10^{-6}}{10^{-5}} = \\frac{5.64}{1.6} \\times 10^{-1} $$\n$$ y^{+} = 3.525 \\times 10^{-1} = 0.3525 $$\nThe result $0.3525$ has four significant figures, as required. This value confirms that the first grid point is located well within the viscous sublayer ($y^{+} \\ll 5$), consistent with the requirements for a wall-resolved simulation.",
