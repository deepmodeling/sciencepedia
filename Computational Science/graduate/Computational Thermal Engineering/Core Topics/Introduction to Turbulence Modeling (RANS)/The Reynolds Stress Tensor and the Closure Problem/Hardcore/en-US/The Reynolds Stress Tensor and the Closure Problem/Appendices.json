Over this volume, the measured mean shear is $\\partial U/\\partial y = S$, and the second-order turbulent velocity correlations (the Reynolds stress tensor components) $\\overline{u'_i u'_j}$ are also obtained.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated for scientific soundness, consistency, and well-posedness. The givens are:\n- Mean velocity field: $\\boldsymbol{U} = (U(y), 0, 0)$.\n- Mean shear: $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = S = 120\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n- Reynolds stress components: $\\overline{u' u'} = 3.00\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$, $\\overline{v' v'} = 1.20\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$, $\\overline{w' w'} = 1.80\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$, $\\overline{u' v'} = -0.90\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$.

The turbulent kinetic energy $k$ is defined as $k = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overline{u'_i u'_i}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overline{u'u'} + \\overline{v'v'} + \\overline{w'w'})$. Using the provided measurements for the normal stresses:\n$$k = \\frac{1}{2}(3.00 + 1.20 + 1.80)\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2} = \\frac{1}{2}(6.00)\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2} = 3.00\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$$\nThis calculated value matches the independently measured value of $k = 3.00\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$, confirming the internal consistency of the provided data. The problem is therefore well-posed and proceeds to solution.\n\nThe central task is to estimate the dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$, under the assumption of local equilibrium between the production rate of turbulent kinetic energy, $P$, and the dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$. This assumption simplifies the TKE transport equation to a simple balance:\n$$P = \\epsilon$$\nThe issue is thus reduced to calculating the production rate $P$.\n\nThe exact production rate of turbulent kinetic energy for an incompressible flow is given by the expression:\n$$P = -\\overline{u'_i u'_j} \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j}$$\nwhere $U_i$ are the components of the mean velocity vector $\\boldsymbol{U}$, $u'_i$ are the components of the fluctuating velocity vector $\\boldsymbol{u'}$, and $\\overline{u'_i u'_j}$ are the components of the Reynolds stress tensor. The summation is over indices $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThe problem specifies a plane shear flow with a mean velocity field $\\boldsymbol{U} = (U(y), 0, 0)$. In Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x, y, z)$, the mean velocity components are $U_1 = U(y)$, $U_2 = 0$, and $U_3 = 0$.\n\nWe must evaluate the mean velocity gradient tensor, $\\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2} & \\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_3} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial U_2}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial U_2}{\\partial x_2} & \\frac{\\partial U_2}{\\partial x_3} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial U_3}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial U_3}{\\partial x_2} & \\frac{\\partial U_3}{\\partial x_3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial U(y)}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial U(y)}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial U(y)}{\\partial z} \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $U$ is a function of $y$ only, $\\frac{\\partial U(y)}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial U(y)}{\\partial z} = 0$. The only non-zero component of the mean velocity gradient tensor is $\\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = S$.\n\nExpanding the expression for production, $P = -\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\overline{u'_i u'_j} \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j}$, most terms become zero. The only surviving term is for $i=1$ and $j=2$:\n$$P = -\\overline{u'_1 u'_2} \\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2}$$\nIn the more common notation with $(u'_1, u'_2, u'_3) = (u', v', w')$ and $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x, y, z)$, this expression is:\n$$P = -\\overline{u' v'} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$$\nThe problem provides the necessary values to calculate $P$:\n- The Reynolds shear stress: $\\overline{u' v'} = -0.90\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$.\n- The mean shear rate: $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = S = 120\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the production formula:\n$$P = -(-0.90\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}) \\times (120\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})$$\n$$P = 0.90 \\times 120\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^3}$$\n$$P = 108\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^3}$$\n\nAccording to the local equilibrium assumption stated in the problem, the production rate is equal to the dissipation rate. Therefore:\n$$\\epsilon = P = 108\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^3}$$\nThe question requests the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $108$ already has three significant figures. The normal stress components and the independent value of $k$, while essential for validating the problem's premises, are not directly required for this calculation under the specified assumptions.",

We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Calculation of the Second Moment $\\overline{u'^{2}}$\nThe second moment of the fluctuation, which represents a component of the turbulent kinetic energy, is defined by the time average:\n$$\n\\overline{u'^{2}}=\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T}\\left(u(t)-U\\right)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nGiven $u(t)=U+u'(t)$, the integrand is simply $(u'(t))^2$.

The averaging interval is $T = 10 \\times (2\\pi / \\omega)$. This length is exactly $10$ periods of the first harmonic (frequency $\\omega$) and $20$ periods of the second harmonic (frequency $2\\omega$).\n\nFor the first term, we use the identity $\\sin^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\cos(2\\theta))$. The average value of $\\sin^{2}(\\cdot)$ over any integer number of full periods is $1/2$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} a^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\omega t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = a^{2} \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\cos(2\\omega t))\\,\\mathrm{d}t = a^{2} \\left[ \\frac{t}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2\\omega t)}{4\\omega} \\right]_{0}^{T} = a^{2}\\frac{T}{2}\n$$\nsince $\\sin(2\\omega T) = \\sin(2\\omega \\cdot 10 \\cdot 2\\pi/\\omega) = \\sin(40\\pi) = 0$.\n\nSimilarly, for the second term, the average value of $\\sin^{2}(2\\omega t + \\phi)$ over an integer number of its periods is also $1/2$. Since $T$ contains $20$ full periods of this function, we have:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} b^{2}\\sin^{2}(2\\omega t+\\phi)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = b^{2} \\left( \\frac{T}{2} \\right)\n$$\nFor the third term, we integrate the product of two sinusoids with different frequencies, $\\omega$ and $2\\omega$. Because the integration interval $T$ is an integer multiple of the periods of both functions, the functions are orthogonal over this interval.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\sin(\\omega t)\\sin(2\\omega t+\\phi)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = 0\n$$\nThus, the total integral simplifies significantly. Combining the terms:\n$$\n\\overline{u'^{2}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\left( a^{2}\\frac{T}{2} + b^{2}\\frac{T}{2} + 0 \\right) = \\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}}{2}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that for a signal composed of orthogonal components, the mean square value is the sum of the mean square values of the components. The mean square value of a sinusoid with amplitude $A$ is $A^2/2$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values $a=0.8\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $b=0.6\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$:\n$$\n\\overline{u'^{2}} = \\frac{(0.8)^{2} + (0.6)^{2}}{2}\\,\\mathrm{(\\frac{m}{s})^{2}} = \\frac{0.64 + 0.36}{2}\\,\\mathrm{(\\frac{m}{s})^{2}} = \\frac{1.00}{2}\\,\\mathrm{(\\frac{m}{s})^{2}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{(\\frac{m}{s})^{2}}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the value is $0.5000\\,\\mathrm{(\\frac{m}{s})^{2}}$.\n\n### Part 2: Statistical Convergence and Implications\nThe problem now shifts to a general, statistically stationary turbulent flow where $u'(t)$ is a random process. The time average $\\overline{u'^{2}}=\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} u'(t)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t$ is used as an estimator, let's call it $\\hat{\\sigma}^2_T$, for the true ensemble average (variance) $\\sigma^{2}=\\mathbb{E}[u'^{2}]$. The question is how the choice of averaging time $T$ affects the accuracy of this estimator.\n\nThe accuracy is measured by the variance of the estimator, $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_T)$. For a stationary process, the estimator is unbiased, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\sigma}^2_T] = \\sigma^2$. The variance is then:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_T) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_T - \\sigma^2 \\right)^2\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_T)^2] - (\\sigma^2)^2\n$$\nWe expand the first term:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_T)^2] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T u'(t)^2 dt \\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{T^2}\\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\int_0^T \\int_0^T u'(t_1)^2 u'(t_2)^2 dt_1 dt_2 \\right]\n$$\nBy Fubini's theorem, we can interchange expectation and integration:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_T)^2] = \\frac{1}{T^2} \\int_0^T \\int_0^T \\mathbb{E}[u'(t_1)^2 u'(t_2)^2] dt_1 dt_2\n$$\nThe term $\\mathbb{E}[u'(t_1)^2 u'(t_2)^2]$ is a fourth-order moment. For turbulent fluctuations that are approximately joint-Gaussian (a common assumption for this type of analysis), we can use Isserlis' theorem for zero-mean Gaussian variables to express the fourth-order moment in terms of second-order moments:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[u'(t_1)^2 u'(t_2)^2] = \\mathbb{E}[u'(t_1)^2]\\mathbb{E}[u'(t_2)^2] + 2\\left(\\mathbb{E}[u'(t_1)u'(t_2)]\\right)^2\n$$\nLet $R_{u'}(\\tau) = \\mathbb{E}[u'(t)u'(t+\\tau)]$ be the autocorrelation function, where $\\tau = t_2-t_1$. For a stationary process, $\\mathbb{E}[u'(t)^2] = R_{u'}(0) = \\sigma^2$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[u'(t_1)^2 u'(t_2)^2] = (\\sigma^2)^2 + 2R_{u'}(t_2-t_1)^2\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_T)$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_T) = \\frac{1}{T^2} \\int_0^T \\int_0^T \\left( (\\sigma^2)^2 + 2R_{u'}(t_2-t_1)^2 \\right) dt_1 dt_2 - (\\sigma^2)^2 = \\frac{2}{T^2} \\int_0^T \\int_0^T R_{u'}(t_2-t_1)^2 dt_1 dt_2\n$$\nTo evaluate this double integral for large $T$ (where $T$ is much larger than the integral time scale of the turbulence), we can perform a change of variables. The integral can be shown to be approximately:\n$$\n\\int_0^T \\int_0^T R_{u'}(t_2-t_1)^2 dt_1 dt_2 \\approx T \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} R_{u'}(\\tau)^2 d\\tau = 2T \\int_{0}^{\\infty} R_{u'}(\\tau)^2 d\\tau\n$$\nTherefore, the large-$T$ scaling for the variance of the estimator is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_T) \\approx \\frac{2}{T^2} \\left( 2T \\int_{0}^{\\infty} R_{u'}(\\tau)^2 d\\tau \\right) = \\frac{4}{T} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} R_{u'}(\\tau)^2 d\\tau\n$$\nThis derivation shows that the variance of the estimator for the mean square fluctuation decreases inversely with the averaging time, $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_T) \\propto 1/T$. Consequently, the statistical uncertainty, or standard error, which is the square root of the variance, decreases as $1/\\sqrt{T}$.\n\n**Interpretation and Context:**\nThe term $\\overline{u'^2}$ is proportional to a diagonal component of the Reynolds stress tensor, $\\mathbf{R}_{ij} = -\\rho \\overline{u'_i u'_j}$. In Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations, the RANS equations contain these Reynolds stress terms, which are unknown and must be modeled. This is the fundamental **closure problem** of turbulence. Turbulence models, from simple eddy-viscosity models to complex Reynolds Stress Models (RSM), are developed to provide these missing terms.\n\nThe derivation above is critically important for both experimental validation and high-fidelity numerical simulation (like Direct Numerical Simulation, DNS, or Large Eddy Simulation, LES) used to develop and test these RANS models.\n1.  **Statistical Convergence:** To obtain reliable values for the Reynolds stresses from experimental data or DNS/LES, one must time-average the fluctuating velocity products. Our result, $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_T) \\propto 1/T$, dictates the required duration of the measurement or simulation. To halve the statistical error in the computed Reynolds stress, one must quadruple the averaging time $T$.\n2.  **Computational Cost:** For large-scale DNS or LES, extending the simulation time $T$ incurs substantial computational cost. The slow convergence rate ($1/\\sqrt{T}$) means achieving high statistical accuracy can be prohibitively expensive, especially for flows with long-lived turbulent structures (i.e., large integral time scales, where $R_{u'}(\\tau)$ decays slowly, making the integral in the variance expression large).\n3.  **Model Validation:** When comparing a RANS model's prediction of $\\overline{u'_i u'_j}$ against DNS data, it is imperative that the DNS data is statistically converged. If $T$ is too short, the \"truth\" data from DNS will be contaminated with statistical noise, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about the RANS model's accuracy. The derived scaling provides a quantitative basis for determining how long is \"long enough\" for an averaging window to be.\n\nIn summary, the choice of averaging window $T$ is not arbitrary but is governed by a trade-off between statistical accuracy and computational/experimental cost. The $1/T$ scaling of the estimator's variance is a fundamental principle guiding the acquisition of statistical data in turbulent flows.",

The normalized tensor $S_{ij}^{\\star}$ is then:\n$$\nS_{ij}^{\\star} = \\frac{S_{ij}}{\\|S\\|_{F}} = \\frac{1}{s_0\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{pmatrix} 2s_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -s_0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -s_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the tensor square $S^{\\star 2} = S_{ik}^{\\star} S_{kj}^{\\star}$. Since $S_{ij}^{\\star}$ is diagonal, this is simply the square of its diagonal elements:\n$$\nS^{\\star 2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right)^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 2^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & (-1)^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{6} \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe trace of $S^{\\star 2}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(S^{\\star 2}) = \\frac{1}{6}(4+1+1) = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n$$\nNow, we substitute these results into the model equation for $a_{ij}$ with $D = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\na_{ij} = D \\left(S^{\\star 2} - \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(S^{\\star 2}) \\delta_{ij}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\frac{1}{3}(1) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)\n$$\n$$\na_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 4/6 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/6 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1/6 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1/3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 2/3 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/6 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1/6 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1/3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)\n$$\n$$\na_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 2/3 - 1/3 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/6 - 2/6 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1/6 - 2/6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1/6 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1/6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/6 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1/12 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1/12 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $a_{ij}$ is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues, denoted $\\lambda_i$, are its diagonal entries:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{6}, \\quad \\lambda_2 = -\\frac{1}{12}, \\quad \\lambda_3 = -\\frac{1}{12}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Realizability Bounds**\n\nThe realizability condition requires the Reynolds stress tensor $R_{ij}$ to be positive semidefinite. We relate its eigenvalues to those of $a_{ij}$. From the definition $a_{ij} = \\frac{R_{ij}}{2k} - \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{ij}$, we can express $R_{ij}$ as:\n$$\nR_{ij} = 2k \\left(a_{ij} + \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{ij}\\right)\n$$\nLet $\\rho_i$ be the eigenvalues of $R_{ij}$ and $\\lambda_i$ be the eigenvalues of $a_{ij}$. The eigenvalues of the tensor $a_{ij} + \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{ij}$ are $\\lambda_i + \\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $R_{ij}$ are:\n$$\n\\rho_i = 2k \\left(\\lambda_i + \\frac{1}{3}\\right)\n$$\nFor $R_{ij}$ to be positive semidefinite, all its eigenvalues must be non-negative: $\\rho_i \\ge 0$. Since $k > 0$, this implies:\n$$\n\\lambda_i + \\frac{1}{3} \\ge 0 \\implies \\lambda_i \\ge -\\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThis establishes the lower bound. For the upper bound, we consider a physical constraint on the normal Reynolds stresses. The $i$-th diagonal component of $R_{ij}$ in any coordinate system is $R_{ii} = \\overline{u_i' u_i'}$. This component cannot exceed the trace of the tensor, $\\mathrm{tr}(R) = \\overline{u_j' u_j'} = 2k$. In the principal-axis system of $R_{ij}$, the diagonal components are its eigenvalues $\\rho_i$. Thus, we must have $\\rho_i \\le \\mathrm{tr}(R_j) = 2k$.\nCombining the non-negativity and this upper bound, we have $0 \\le \\rho_i \\le 2k$. Substituting the expression for $\\rho_i$:\n$$\n0 \\le 2k \\left(\\lambda_i + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\le 2k\n$$\nDividing by $2k > 0$ preserves the inequalities:\n$$\n0 \\le \\lambda_i + \\frac{1}{3} \\le 1\n$$\nThis yields two conditions:\n1.  $\\lambda_i + \\frac{1}{3} \\ge 0 \\implies \\lambda_i \\ge -\\frac{1}{3}$\n2.  $\\lambda_i + \\frac{1}{3} \\le 1 \\implies \\lambda_i \\le \\frac{2}{3}$\nThus, the physically admissible interval for any eigenvalue of the anisotropy tensor is $\\left[-\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\right]$.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the Realizability Margin $m$**\n\nThe realizability margin is defined as $m = \\min_{i}\\,\\min\\!\\left(\\lambda_{i} + \\dfrac{1}{3},\\; \\dfrac{2}{3} - \\lambda_{i}\\right)$. This measures the minimum \"distance\" of any eigenvalue from the boundaries of the admissible interval. We compute this for the distinct eigenvalues found in Part 1.\n\nFor $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{6}$:\nThe two terms are:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} - \\lambda_1 = \\frac{4}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe minimum for this eigenvalue is $\\min\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor the degenerate eigenvalue $\\lambda_{2,3} = -\\frac{1}{12}$:\nThe two terms are:\n$$\n\\lambda_2 + \\frac{1}{3} = -\\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} - \\lambda_2 = \\frac{8}{12} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{12}\\right) = \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\nThe minimum for this eigenvalue is $\\min\\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe overall realizability margin $m$ is the minimum of the margins calculated for each eigenvalue:\n$$\nm = \\min\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nThe calculated eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.167$ and $\\lambda_2 = - \\frac{1}{12} \\approx -0.083$ are both within the interval $[-\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}] \\approx [-0.333, 0.667]$, so the model is realizable for this flow. The margin $m$ quantifies that the second eigenvalue is closest to a realizability boundary.",
