            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of an expression for the turbulent shear stress component $\\tau_{12}$, its numerical evaluation, and a discussion of the model's limitations under system rotation.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the turbulent shear stress, $\\tau_{12}$. The Reynolds-averaged momentum equation for a statistically steady, incompressible flow contains the divergence of the Reynolds stress tensor, $-\\rho \\overline{u'_i u'_j}$, which represents the effect of turbulence on the mean flow. The turbulent stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, is defined by its components $\\tau_{ij} = -\\rho \\overline{u'_i u'_j}$.\n\nThe Boussinesq eddy-viscosity hypothesis is a central assumption of the standard $k-\\varepsilon$ model. It relates the Reynolds stress tensor to the mean strain-rate tensor, $S_{ij}$, in a manner analogous to how viscous stress is related to the strain rate in a Newtonian fluid. The hypothesis is expressed as:\n$$\n\\tau_{ij} = -\\rho \\overline{u'_i u'_j} = \\mu_t \\left( \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial U_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right) - \\frac{2}{3} \\rho k \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_t$ is the turbulent (or eddy) viscosity, $U_i$ are the components of the mean velocity vector, $k$ is the turbulent kinetic energy, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The term in the parentheses is twice the mean strain-rate tensor, $S_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial U_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right)$. Substituting this definition, the hypothesis becomes:\n$$\n\\tau_{ij} = 2 \\mu_t S_{ij} - \\frac{2}{3} \\rho k \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nWe are interested in the shear stress component $\\tau_{12}$, which corresponds to setting $i=1$ and $j=2$. For these indices, the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{12}$ is $0$. Therefore, the expression for $\\tau_{12}$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\tau_{12} = 2 \\mu_t S_{12}\n$$\nIn a two-equation $k-\\varepsilon$ model, the eddy viscosity $\\mu_t$ is not a fluid property but is modeled based on local turbulence quantities. For a high-Reynolds-number flow, the standard model relates $\\mu_t$ to the turbulent kinetic energy, $k$, and its dissipation rate, $\\varepsilon$, through a dimensional argument:\n$$\n\\mu_t = \\rho C_{\\mu} \\frac{k^2}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\mu}$ is an empirical constant.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\mu_t$ into the equation for $\\tau_{12}$ yields the final derived expression:\n$$\n\\tau_{12} = 2 \\left( \\rho C_{\\mu} \\frac{k^2}{\\varepsilon} \\right) S_{12}\n$$\nThis expression relates the turbulent shear stress to the mean strain-rate component $S_{12}$ and the local turbulence properties $k$ and $\\varepsilon$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\tau_{12}$ using the provided numerical values:\n- Mean strain-rate component, $S_{12} = 150\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Turbulent kinetic energy, $k = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$\n- Turbulence dissipation rate, $\\varepsilon = 0.75\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-3}$\n- Fluid density, $\\rho = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- Eddy-viscosity constant, $C_{\\mu} = 0.09$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\tau_{12} = 2 \\times (1.20\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\times (0.09) \\times \\frac{(0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2})^2}{0.75\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-3}} \\times (150\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{12} = 2 \\times 1.20 \\times 0.09 \\times \\frac{0.25}{0.75} \\times 150 \\,\\,\\, \\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{12} = 0.216 \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times 150 \\,\\,\\, \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{12} = 0.072 \\times 150 \\,\\,\\, \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{12} = 10.8 \\,\\,\\, \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nThe result $10.8$ has three significant figures, as requested.\n\nFinally, we discuss the model's limitations under strong spanwise system rotation. The standard $k-\\varepsilon$ model's prediction for $\\tau_{12}$ is fundamentally limited under strong system rotation because the model is \"blind\" to such effects. The most directly violated assumption is the Boussinesq hypothesis, which posits a linear relationship between the Reynolds stress tensor and the mean rate-of-strain tensor via a scalar eddy viscosity, $\\mu_t = \\rho C_{\\mu} k^2/\\varepsilon$. This formulation implies that the principal axes of the stress and strain tensors are aligned and that $\\mu_t$ is an isotropic property of the turbulence. However, strong system rotation, through the Coriolis effect, induces significant anisotropy in the turbulence structure, altering the production and transport of Reynolds stresses. For spanwise rotation in a shear flow, this either suppresses (for cyclonic or stabilizing rotation, where rotation and mean vorticity have the same sign) or enhances (for anticyclonic or destabilizing rotation, where they have opposite signs) the turbulent momentum transfer. Since the model's calculation of $\\tau_{12}$ depends only on local values of $S_{12}$, $k$, and $\\varepsilon$, it yields the same result regardless of the rotation rate, failing to capture these critical, physically observed effects on the turbulent shear stress.",

In its general form, using Reynolds-averaged quantities, it is defined as the product of the Reynolds stress tensor and the mean velocity gradient tensor.

The term $\\overline{u'_i u'_j}$ is the specific Reynolds stress tensor.\n\nTwo-equation models, such as the $k-\\varepsilon$ model, employ the Boussinesq hypothesis (or eddy-viscosity hypothesis) to model the Reynolds stresses. This hypothesis relates the Reynolds stresses to the mean rate of strain, $S_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial U_j}{\\partial x_i}\\right)$, through an eddy viscosity, $\\nu_t$:\n$$\n-\\overline{u'_i u'_j} = \\nu_t \\left( \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial U_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right) - \\frac{2}{3} k \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the turbulent kinetic energy and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nSubstituting the Boussinesq hypothesis into the expression for $P_k$ gives:\n$$\nP_k = \\left[ \\nu_t \\left( \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial U_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right) - \\frac{2}{3} k \\delta_{ij} \\right] \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j}\n$$\nExpanding the product yields:\n$$\nP_k = \\nu_t \\left( \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial U_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right) \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} - \\frac{2}{3} k \\delta_{ij} \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j}\n$$\nThe second term simplifies to $-\\frac{2}{3} k \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_i}$.

            "solution": "The objective is to determine the wall-normal distance $y$ to the first off-wall node such that the inner-scaled distance $y^{+}$ at that node is approximately $1$. The derivation starts from the inner scaling of wall-bounded turbulent flows, which is constructed using the viscous length scale and the friction velocity. These inner scales emerge from nondimensionalizing the near-wall momentum equation so that viscous effects in the immediate vicinity of the wall are of order unity.\n\nFirst, define the friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$ using the measured wall shear stress $\\tau_{w}$ and the fluid density $\\rho$. This definition is a well-tested consequence of the near-wall momentum balance and serves as the velocity scale for inner variables:\n$$\nu_{\\tau} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau_{w}}{\\rho}}.\n$$\nNext, define the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ from the dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ and density $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}.\n$$\nThe inner-scaled wall-normal coordinate $y^{+}$ is then defined by\n$$\ny^{+} = \\frac{y\\,u_{\\tau}}{\\nu},\n$$\nwhich follows from dimensional analysis of the viscous sublayer, where the characteristic length scale is $\\nu/u_{\\tau}$ and velocities scale with $u_{\\tau}$.

In the viscous sublayer, the turbulent kinetic energy $k$ tends to zero and viscous effects dominate; model terms are often damped through functions of $y^{+}$ so that the modeled eddy viscosity approaches zero near the wall. To capture these behaviors faithfully, the mesh must resolve the viscous sublayer with $y^{+} \\lesssim 1$ at the first node.\n- Using wall functions (which assume an overlap-layer logarithmic law and suppress the need to resolve the viscous sublayer) is incompatible with low-Re integrations, because wall functions bypass the region where low-Re damping functions and near-wall asymptotics are intended to operate. With $y^{+} \\approx 1$, one should not use wall functions; instead, the solver should employ low-Re variants and enforce correct boundary conditions at the wall (e.g., $k \\rightarrow 0$ and appropriate treatment of the dissipation rate or specific dissipation).\n- From a mesh design perspective in computational thermal engineering, resolving $y^{+} \\approx 1$ implies extremely thin first cells adjacent to the wall, as computed above. Subsequent layers should grow gradually to maintain adequate resolution through the buffer layer and into the logarithmic region; anisotropic stretching in the wall-normal direction is typical, but growth rates should be conservative to prevent excessive interpolation error and to maintain acceptable cell aspect ratios. Thermal boundary layers may be thinner than velocity boundary layers in fluids with low Prandtl number, requiring even finer near-wall spacing if temperature gradients are to be directly resolved without wall heat transfer models.\n\nThe calculation above provides the quantitative spacing needed for the first off-wall node and the conceptual rationale for why such resolution is essential in low-Re two-equation turbulence modeling.",
