It is based on established principles of computational fluid dynamics, specifically Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts. First, we justify the functional form of the turbulent kinematic viscosity, $\\nu_t$, using dimensional analysis. Second, we compute $\\nu_t$ for both the standard and RNG $k$–$\\epsilon$ models and then determine their fractional difference.\n\nThe Boussinesq hypothesis provides a linear relationship between the Reynolds stress tensor and the mean strain rate tensor, introducing the turbulent (or eddy) kinematic viscosity, $\\nu_t$. For high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows, the local state of turbulence can often be characterized by two parameters: the turbulent kinetic energy, $k$, and its rate of dissipation, $\\epsilon$. The quantity $k$ represents the energy contained in the turbulent fluctuations (per unit mass), and $\\epsilon$ represents the rate at which this energy is converted into thermal internal energy (per unit mass).\n\nWe seek to find a functional relationship for $\\nu_t$ based on $k$ and $\\epsilon$ through dimensional analysis. Let $[L]$, $[M]$, and $[T]$ represent the fundamental dimensions of length, mass, and time, respectively. The dimensions of the quantities of interest are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Turbulent kinematic viscosity, $\\nu_t$: This has the same dimensions as molecular kinematic viscosity, which is a diffusivity. $[\\nu_t] = L^2 T^{-1}$.\n    \\item Turbulent kinetic energy, $k$: This is energy per unit mass, which has dimensions of velocity squared. $[k] = (L T^{-1})^2 = L^2 T^{-2}$.\n    \\item Turbulent dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$: This is energy per unit mass per unit time, or $k$ per unit time. $[\\epsilon] = \\frac{[k]}{[T]} = \\frac{L^2 T^{-2}}{T} = L^2 T^{-3}$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWe assume a power-law relationship of the form:\n$$ \\nu_t = C_\\mu k^a \\epsilon^b $$\nwhere $C_\\mu$ is a dimensionless proportionality constant, and $a$ and $b$ are exponents to be determined. Equating the dimensions on both sides of the equation:\n$$ [\\nu_t] = [k]^a [\\epsilon]^b $$\n$$ L^2 T^{-1} = (L^2 T^{-2})^a (L^2 T^{-3})^b $$\n$$ L^2 T^{-1} = L^{2a} T^{-2a} L^{2b} T^{-3b} $$\n$$ L^2 T^{-1} = L^{2a+2b} T^{-2a-3b} $$\n\nFor the equation to be dimensionally homogeneous, the exponents of each fundamental dimension must be equal on both sides. This yields a system of two linear equations for $a$ and $b$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item For dimension $L$: $2 = 2a + 2b \\implies 1 = a + b$\n    \\item For dimension $T$: $-1 = -2a - 3b \\implies 1 = 2a + 3b$\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nFrom equation (1), we express $b$ in terms of $a$: $b = 1 - a$.\nSubstituting this into equation (2):\n$$ 1 = 2a + 3(1 - a) $$\n$$ 1 = 2a + 3 - 3a $$\n$$ 1 = 3 - a $$\n$$ a = 2 $$\nNow, we find $b$:\n$$ b = 1 - a = 1 - 2 = -1 $$\nThus, the exponents are $a=2$ and $b=-1$.

The first six significant figures are $6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1$. The seventh digit is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., truncate).\n$$ \\Delta \\approx 0.0611111 $$\nThis dimensionless value represents the fractional reduction in predicted turbulent viscosity when using the RNG model compared to the standard model for the given conditions.

It concerns the standard Renormalization Group (RNG) $k$–$\\epsilon$ turbulence model, a well-established construct in computational fluid dynamics. The equations and definitions provided are correct and standard in the literature. The task requires a straightforward application of asymptotic analysis to a well-defined rational function, which is a standard mathematical procedure.

Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine the leading-order asymptotic expressions for the RNG term $R_{\\epsilon}$ in the limits of weak strain ($\\eta \\to 0$) and strong strain ($\\eta \\to \\infty$). The term is given by\n$$\nR_{\\epsilon} = C_{\\mu}\\,\\rho\\,\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{k}\\, r(\\eta)\n$$\nwhere $r(\\eta)$ is a function of the dimensionless strain parameter $\\eta = \\frac{S\\,k}{\\epsilon}$.

We examine the leading-order behavior of the function $r(\\eta)$ as its argument approaches zero.\nFor the numerator of $r(\\eta)$, as $\\eta \\to 0$, the term $\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta_{0}}$ becomes negligible compared to $1$. Thus, the expression $(1 - \\frac{\\eta}{\\eta_{0}})$ approaches $1$. The numerator is asymptotically equivalent to $\\eta^{3}$.\n$$\n\\eta^{3}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\eta}{\\eta_{0}}\\right) \\sim \\eta^{3} \\quad \\text{as} \\quad \\eta \\to 0\n$$\nFor the denominator, as $\\eta \\to 0$, the term $\\beta\\,\\eta^{3}$ becomes negligible compared to $1$.

To do this, we identify the highest power of $\\eta$ in the numerator and the denominator.\nThe numerator is $\\eta^{3} - \\frac{\\eta^{4}}{\\eta_{0}}$. For large $\\eta$, the term $-\\frac{\\eta^{4}}{\\eta_{0}}$ dominates.\nThe denominator is $1 + \\beta\\,\\eta^{3}$.

The term $R_{\\epsilon}$ typically appears in the dissipation rate transport equation with a negative sign, as in $\\frac{D\\epsilon}{Dt} = \\dots - R_{\\epsilon}$.\n\nIn the limit of weak strain ($\\eta \\to 0$), $L_0$ is positive since all its constituent variables and constants ($C_{\\mu}, \\rho, S, k, \\epsilon$) are non-negative. This means the term $-R_{\\epsilon}$ becomes a sink (destruction) term in the $\\epsilon$ equation. The model introduces additional dissipation destruction in weakly strained regions, which helps to correct the behavior of the standard $k$-$\\epsilon$ model in regions approaching stagnation ($S \\to 0$).\n\nIn the limit of strong strain ($\\eta \\to \\infty$), $L_{\\infty}$ is negative. Consequently, the term $-R_{\\epsilon}$ becomes a source (production) term for $\\epsilon$. This increased production of $\\epsilon$ leads to a faster dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy. The turbulent viscosity, $\\mu_t = C_{\\mu}\\,\\rho\\,\\frac{k^{2}}{\\epsilon}$, is consequently reduced. This is a key feature of the RNG model: it systematically reduces the turbulent viscosity in regions of high strain rate, thereby correcting the tendency of the standard $k$-$\\epsilon$ model to over-predict turbulent mixing in such regions.",
