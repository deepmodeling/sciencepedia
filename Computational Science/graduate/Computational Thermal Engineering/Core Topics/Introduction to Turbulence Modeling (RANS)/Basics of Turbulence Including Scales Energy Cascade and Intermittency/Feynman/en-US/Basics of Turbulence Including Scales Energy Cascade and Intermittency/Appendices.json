The box edge length is $L=0.10\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and the bulk mean speed is $U=1.0\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$. The target large-scale Reynolds number is $Re_{L}=UL/\\nu=10^{4}$, where $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity to be used in the simulation. The turbulence is sustained so that the large-scale mean energy dissipation rate follows the canonical scaling with a constant of order one; take the large-scale dissipation constant to be $C_{\\epsilon}=1$. The spatial discretization is uniform and isotropic, and the time integration is explicit.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. All necessary data and definitions for computing the required quantities are provided, and no contradictions are present. The problem is a standard exercise in computational fluid dynamics, specifically concerning the setup of a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of turbulence. We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the minimal integer number of grid points per spatial direction, $N$, and the maximal stable timestep, $\\Delta t$.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of grid points $N$. This requires calculating the required grid spacing, $\\Delta x$, which is set to be equal to the Kolmogorov length scale, $\\eta$. The calculation of $\\eta$ depends on the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, and the mean energy dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$.\n\n1.  **Calculate Kinematic Viscosity, $\\nu$**:\n    The large-scale Reynolds number is defined as $Re_{L} = \\frac{UL}{\\nu}$. We are given $Re_{L}=10^{4}$, the bulk mean speed $U=1.0 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, and the box edge length $L=0.10 \\ \\mathrm{m}$. We can solve for $\\nu$:\n    $$ \\nu = \\frac{UL}{Re_{L}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\ \\mathrm{m/s})(0.10 \\ \\mathrm{m})}{10^{4}} = \\frac{0.10 \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}}{10000} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} $$\n\n2.  **Calculate Mean Energy Dissipation Rate, $\\epsilon$**:\n    The problem provides the canonical scaling for the large-scale mean energy dissipation rate: $\\epsilon = C_{\\epsilon} \\frac{U^3}{L}$. We are given the constant $C_{\\epsilon}=1$.\n    $$ \\epsilon = (1) \\frac{(1.0 \\ \\mathrm{m/s})^3}{0.10 \\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{1.0 \\ \\mathrm{m^3/s^3}}{0.10 \\ \\mathrm{m}} = 10.0 \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^3} $$\n\n3.  **Calculate Kolmogorov Length Scale, $\\eta$**:\n    The Kolmogorov length scale is defined by $\\eta = \\left( \\frac{\\nu^3}{\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/4}$.\n    $$ \\eta = \\left( \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s})^3}{10.0 \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^3}} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{m^6/s^3}}{10.0 \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^3}} \\right)^{1/4} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-16} \\ \\mathrm{m^4})^{1/4} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate Grid Points per Direction, $N$**:\n    The spatial resolution requirement is that the grid spacing, $\\Delta x$, equals the Kolmogorov length scale, $\\eta$. So, $\\Delta x = \\eta = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n    The box is cubic with edge length $L$. For a uniform grid, the number of grid points $N$ required to cover this length is given by $N = \\frac{L}{\\Delta x}$.\n    $$ N = \\frac{0.10 \\ \\mathrm{m}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{10^{-1}}{10^{-4}} = 10^3 = 1000 $$\n    Since $N=1000$ is an integer, it is the minimal integer number of grid points required.\n\nNext, we determine the maximal stable timestep, $\\Delta t$. This is the most restrictive (i.e., the minimum) of three upper bounds: the convective (CFL) constraint $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{conv}}$, the viscous stability constraint $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{visc}}$, and the Kolmogorov time-scale resolution constraint $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{Kolm}}$.\n\n1.  **Convective Stability Constraint (CFL)**:\n    The CFL condition for the convective term is given as $\\frac{u_{\\max} \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\le C_{\\mathrm{CFL}}$. The maximal timestep allowed by this constraint is $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{conv}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{CFL}} \\Delta x}{u_{\\max}}$.\n    We are given $C_{\\mathrm{CFL}}=0.50$ and the estimated peak speed $u_{\\max}=1.5 U = 1.5(1.0 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}) = 1.5 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$. We have already calculated $\\Delta x = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n    $$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{conv}} = \\frac{(0.50)(1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.5 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 3.3333 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n\n2.  **Viscous Stability Constraint**:\n    For an explicit method with central differences for the viscous term in $d=3$ spatial dimensions, the canonical stability bound on a uniform grid is $\\frac{\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le \\frac{1}{2d}$. The maximal timestep is therefore $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{visc}} = \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2d\\nu}$.\n    With $d=3$, $\\nu=1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$, and $\\Delta x = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n    $$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{visc}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m})^2}{2(3)(1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s})} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m^2}}{6.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 1.6667 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n    The Prandtl number is $\\mathrm{Pr}=1$, so the thermal diffusivity equals the kinematic viscosity, and the stability constraint for the energy equation is identical.\n\n3.  **Kolmogorov Time-Scale Resolution Constraint**:\n    The problem requires the timestep to resolve the Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_{\\eta}$, such that $\\Delta t \\le c_{\\tau} \\tau_{\\eta}$. So, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{Kolm}} = c_{\\tau} \\tau_{\\eta}$.\n    First, we compute $\\tau_{\\eta} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/2}$:\n    $$ \\tau_{\\eta} = \\left(\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}}{10.0 \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^3}}\\right)^{1/2} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{s^2})^{1/2} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n    With the given fraction $c_{\\tau}=0.20$:\n    $$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{Kolm}} = (0.20)(1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s}) = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n\n4.  **Maximal Stable Timestep, $\\Delta t$**:\n    The overall maximal stable timestep is the minimum of the three constraints:\n    $$ \\Delta t = \\min(\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{conv}}, \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{visc}}, \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{Kolm}}) $$\n    $$ \\Delta t = \\min(3.3333 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{s}, \\ 1.6667 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{s}, \\ 2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{s}) $$\n    The most restrictive constraint is the convective CFL limit.\n    $$ \\Delta t = 3.3333... \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n    Rounding this value to four significant figures as requested gives:\n    $$ \\Delta t \\approx 3.333 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(N, \\Delta t)$.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and provides all necessary information to proceed with a solution. The analysis commences by defining and calculating the relevant physical and non-dimensional parameters.\n\nFirst, we establish the wall-unit-based normalization scheme. For a turbulent flow, the friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$ and kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ are used to define the characteristic scales near a wall. The viscous length scale, or wall unit, is defined as:\n$$ \\delta_{\\nu} = \\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau}} $$\nAny dimensional quantity $Q$ can be made dimensionless, denoted as $Q^{+}$, by normalizing it with the appropriate combination of $u_{\\tau}$ and $\\nu$. For a length $L$, the non-dimensional counterpart is $L^{+} = L / \\delta_{\\nu}$.\n\nThe problem requires the evaluation of the Prandtl number, $\\mathrm{Pr}$, which is the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity. Using the provided values:\n$$ \\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}}{1.43 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}} \\approx 6.993 $$\nSince $\\mathrm{Pr} > 1$, the smallest scales of the thermal field (Batchelor scales) will be smaller than the smallest scales of the velocity field (Kolmogorov microscales).\n\nNext, we determine the friction Reynolds number for each operating point. The friction Reynolds number, $Re_{\\tau}$, is defined based on the channel half-height $h$ and the wall-friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$:\n$$ Re_{\\tau} = \\frac{u_{\\tau}h}{\\nu} $$\nFor the first operating point, with $u_{\\tau,1} = 0.10 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$:\n$$ Re_{\\tau,1} = \\frac{(0.10 \\ \\mathrm{m/s})(0.050 \\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}} = \\frac{0.005}{1.00 \\times 10^{-6}} = 5000 $$\nFor the second, higher-friction-velocity operating point, with $u_{\\tau,2} = 0.20 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$:\n$$ Re_{\\tau,2} = \\frac{(0.20 \\ \\mathrm{m/s})(0.050 \\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}} = \\frac{0.01}{1.00 \\times 10^{-6}} = 10000 $$\n\nWe now derive the wall-unit expressions for the Kolmogorov and Batchelor microscales. The dimensional Kolmogorov microscale, $\\eta$, is the characteristic length scale at which viscous forces dominate and dissipate turbulent kinetic energy. It is defined as:\n$$ \\eta = \\left(\\frac{\\nu^3}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/4} $$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the dimensional rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation per unit mass.\n\nThe dissipation rate in wall units, $\\epsilon^{+}$, is defined by normalizing $\\epsilon$ with $u_{\\tau}$ and $\\nu$:\n$$ \\epsilon^{+} = \\frac{\\epsilon \\nu}{u_{\\tau}^4} $$\nFrom this, we can express the dimensional dissipation rate as $\\epsilon = \\epsilon^{+} u_{\\tau}^4 / \\nu$. Substituting this into the definition of $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta = \\left(\\frac{\\nu^3}{\\epsilon^{+} u_{\\tau}^4 / \\nu}\\right)^{1/4} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu^4}{\\epsilon^{+} u_{\\tau}^4}\\right)^{1/4} = \\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau}} (\\epsilon^{+})^{-1/4} $$\nRecognizing that $\\delta_{\\nu} = \\nu / u_{\\tau}$, we have $\\eta = \\delta_{\\nu} (\\epsilon^{+})^{-1/4}$. The Kolmogorov microscale in wall units, $\\eta^{+}$, is therefore:\n$$ \\eta^{+} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\delta_{\\nu}} = (\\epsilon^{+})^{-1/4} $$\nThe Batchelor scale, $\\eta_B$, is the smallest length scale in a passive scalar field for fluids with $\\mathrm{Pr} > 1$. It is related to the Kolmogorov scale by:\n$$ \\eta_B = \\frac{\\eta}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Pr}}} $$\nExpressing this in wall units:\n$$ \\eta_{B}^{+} = \\frac{\\eta_B}{\\delta_{\\nu}} = \\frac{\\eta/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Pr}}}{\\delta_{\\nu}} = \\frac{\\eta^{+}}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Pr}}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\eta^{+}$:\n$$ \\eta_{B}^{+} = \\frac{(\\epsilon^{+})^{-1/4}}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Pr}}} $$\nThe problem states that at the near-wall location $y^{+} \\approx 1$, the non-dimensional dissipation is $\\epsilon^{+} = 5.0$. Specializing the derived expressions for this location:\n$$ \\eta^{+} = (5.0)^{-1/4} \\approx 0.6687 $$\n$$ \\eta_{B}^{+} = \\frac{(5.0)^{-1/4}}{\\sqrt{6.993}} \\approx \\frac{0.6687}{2.644} \\approx 0.2529 $$\n\nThe hierarchy of length scales in turbulence is crucial for understanding resolution requirements. The largest, energy-containing eddies scale with the geometry, in this case $h$. The smallest, dissipative eddies of the velocity field are of size $\\eta$, and for the thermal field, $\\eta_B$. For this flow, $\\mathrm{Pr} \\approx 7 > 1$, so the hierarchy of scales is $h \\gg \\eta > \\eta_B$. Wall-resolved simulations, such as DNS, must use a grid fine enough to resolve the smallest active scales everywhere in the domain. The most stringent requirement is typically near the wall, where gradients are steepest and the dissipative scales are smallest in physical units.\n\nAs $Re_{\\tau}$ increases, $u_{\\tau}$ increases. The viscous length scale $\\delta_{\\nu} = \\nu / u_{\\tau}$ decreases. Consequently, the physical size of the near-wall turbulent structures shrinks. The Kolmogorov scale, $\\eta = \\eta^{+} \\delta_{\\nu}$, and Batchelor scale, $\\eta_B = \\eta_B^+ \\delta_{\\nu}$, also become smaller in physical units, assuming $\\epsilon^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Pr}$ are fixed. This increasing separation of scales ($h/\\eta_B \\propto Re_{\\tau}$) means that resolving a high-$Re_{\\tau}$ flow demands a much finer grid and is therefore computationally much more expensive.\n\nFurthermore, the use of a mean dissipation rate $\\langle\\epsilon\\rangle$ (and thus $\\langle\\epsilon\\rangle^{+}$) is a simplification. Turbulence is an intermittent phenomenon, meaning that the instantaneous dissipation rate $\\epsilon_{\\text{inst}}$ can be orders of magnitude larger than its mean value in localized regions. Since $\\eta \\propto \\epsilon^{-1/4}$ and $\\eta_B \\propto \\epsilon^{-1/4}$, these high-dissipation events correspond to regions where the dissipative scales are momentarily much smaller. A conservative grid design for DNS must be able to resolve these extreme events, not just the mean scales. This implies a resolution criterion of $\\Delta \\ll \\eta_B(\\langle\\epsilon\\rangle)$ to ensure fidelity, making the resolution problem even more challenging at high $Re_{\\tau}$.\n\nFinally, we determine the minimum wall-normal grid spacing, $\\Delta y_{\\min}$, required to resolve the Batchelor scale at $y^{+} \\approx 1$ for the higher-$Re_{\\tau}$ case ($Re_{\\tau,2} = 10000$). The resolution criterion is given as $\\Delta y_{\\min} \\leq \\eta_{B}$. We take the limiting case $\\Delta y_{\\min} = \\eta_B$.\nThe calculation is performed for the case with $u_{\\tau,2} = 0.20 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$. The corresponding viscous length scale is:\n$$ \\delta_{\\nu,2} = \\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau,2}} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}}{0.20 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe dimensional Batchelor scale at $y^{+} \\approx 1$ is found by converting $\\eta_B^+$ back to physical units:\n$$ \\eta_B = \\eta_{B}^{+} \\times \\delta_{\\nu,2} \\approx (0.2529) \\times (5.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}) \\approx 1.2645 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nTo satisfy the resolution criterion, the grid spacing must be at most this value:\n$$ \\Delta y_{\\min} = 1.2645 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nConverting to micrometers and rounding to three significant figures:\n$$ \\Delta y_{\\min} \\approx 1.26 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} $$\n\nThe final answers are the two friction Reynolds numbers and the minimum grid spacing for the higher Reynolds number case, rounded to three significant figures as requested:\n$Re_{\\tau,1} = 5.00 \\times 10^3$\n$Re_{\\tau,2} = 1.00 \\times 10^4$\n$\\Delta y_{\\min} \\approx 1.26 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$",

            "solution": "The problem requires the construction of the multifractal spectrum, $f(\\alpha)$, for turbulent velocity fields from given models of the structure function scaling exponents, $\\zeta(p)$. The solution involves applying the multifractal formalism, which uses a Legendre transform to relate the scaling exponents $\\zeta(p)$ to the spectrum $f(\\alpha)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical foundation. The $p$-th order structure function of longitudinal velocity increments, $\\delta u(\\ell) = u(x+\\ell) - u(x)$, is defined as $S_p(\\ell) = \\langle |\\delta u(\\ell)|^p \\rangle$. In the inertial range of turbulence, these functions exhibit power-law scaling, $S_p(\\ell) \\sim \\ell^{\\zeta(p)}$. The exponents $\\zeta(p)$ encapsulate the statistical properties of the turbulent fluctuations across different scales.\n\nThe 1941 Kolmogorov theory (K41) predicts a linear scaling, $\\zeta(p) = p/3$. This corresponds to a self-similar, non-intermittent cascade. However, experimental data show that $\\zeta(p)$ is a concave function of $p$, a phenomenon known as intermittency. This implies that the intensity of turbulent fluctuations is not uniformly distributed in space; instead, it is concentrated in regions of varying singularity strength.\n\nThe multifractal formalism, introduced by Parisi and Frisch, provides a geometric language to describe this intermittency. It postulates that for small scales $\\ell$, the velocity increments exhibit a local power-law scaling, $|\\delta u(\\ell)| \\sim \\ell^{\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ is the local Hölder exponent. The key insight is that $\\alpha$ is not constant throughout the fluid but takes a range of values. The set of points where the Hölder exponent is $\\alpha$ is a fractal set with a Hausdorff dimension $f(\\alpha)$. The function $f(\\alpha)$ is the multifractal spectrum.\n\nThe relationship between the globally averaged exponents $\\zeta(p)$ and the local spectrum $f(\\alpha)$ is established via large-deviation arguments, leading to a Legendre transform. The number of disjoint spatial regions of size $\\ell$ is proportional to $\\ell^{-d}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the embedding space. The number of such regions characterized by a specific Hölder exponent $\\alpha$ is assumed to scale as $N_\\ell(\\alpha) \\sim \\ell^{-f(\\alpha)}$.\n\nThe structure function $S_p(\\ell)$ can be estimated by integrating the contributions from all possible singularities:\n$$\nS_p(\\ell) = \\langle |\\delta u(\\ell)|^p \\rangle \\sim \\ell^d \\int d\\alpha \\, N_\\ell(\\alpha) \\left(\\ell^\\alpha\\right)^p \\sim \\ell^d \\int d\\alpha \\, \\ell^{p\\alpha - f(\\alpha)}\n$$\nFor small $\\ell$, this integral can be approximated using a saddle-point method, where the dominant contribution comes from the value of $\\alpha$ that minimizes the exponent:\n$$\nS_p(\\ell) \\sim \\ell^{d + \\min_\\alpha (p\\alpha - f(\\alpha))}\n$$\nBy comparing this with the definition $S_p(\\ell) \\sim \\ell^{\\zeta(p)}$, we obtain the fundamental relationship:\n$$\n\\zeta(p) = d + \\min_\\alpha (p\\alpha - f(\\alpha))\n$$\nThis equation shows that $\\zeta(p) - d$ is the Legendre transform of $f(\\alpha)$. Assuming $f(\\alpha)$ is a convex function, this transform is invertible. The inverse Legendre transform gives the spectrum $f(\\alpha)$ in terms of $\\zeta(p)$:\n$$\nf(\\alpha) = \\max_p (p\\alpha - (\\zeta(p) - d)) = \\max_p (p\\alpha - \\zeta(p) + d)\n$$\nTo find the maximum with respect to $p$, we set the derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} [p\\alpha - \\zeta(p) + d] = \\alpha - \\frac{d\\zeta(p)}{dp} = 0\n$$\nThis yields the parametric equation for the Hölder exponent $\\alpha$ as a function of the moment order $p$:\n$$\n\\alpha(p) = \\frac{d\\zeta(p)}{dp}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\alpha$ back into the equation for $f(\\alpha)$, we obtain the corresponding parametric equation for the spectrum $f$ as a function of $p$:\n$$\nf(p) = p \\cdot \\alpha(p) - \\zeta(p) + d = p \\frac{d\\zeta(p)}{dp} - \\zeta(p) + d\n$$\nThe problem specifies an embedding dimension $d=3$. The phrase \"one-dimensional embedding dimension\" is interpreted as a slight misstatement, where the intended physical space dimension is $d=3$.\n\nThe numerical algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Discretize the moment order $p$ on a uniform grid over the interval $[0, 10]$ with $2001$ points. Let the grid spacing be $\\Delta p$.\n2.  For each of the three given models of $\\zeta(p)$, evaluate $\\zeta(p_i)$ for all points $p_i$ on the grid.\n3.  Numerically compute the derivative $\\alpha(p_i) = \\zeta'(p_i)$. A second-order central difference scheme is appropriate for interior points, with first-order forward and backward differences at the boundaries. This can be robustly implemented using a standard numerical gradient function.\n4.  Calculate the spectrum values $f(p_i)$ using the derived parametric equation: $f(p_i) = p_i \\alpha(p_i) - \\zeta(p_i) + 3$.\n5.  From the computed arrays for $\\alpha(p)$ and $f(p)$, extract the required quantities:\n    -   $\\alpha_{\\min} = \\min_{i} \\alpha(p_i)$\n    -   $\\alpha_{\\max} = \\max_{i} \\alpha(p_i)$\n    -   $f_{\\max} = \\max_{i} f(p_i)$\n    -   $\\alpha_\\star$: Find the index $i_\\star$ corresponding to the first occurrence of $f_{\\max}$ (i.e., at the smallest $p$). Then $\\alpha_\\star = \\alpha(p_{i_\\star})$.\n    -   $\\Delta\\alpha = \\alpha_{\\max} - \\alpha_{\\min}$\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the three models for $\\zeta(p)$: the non-intermittent Kolmogorov 1941 model, the Lognormal model, and the She–Leveque 1994 model.\n\nFor the K41 model, $\\zeta(p) = p/3$, we analytically find $\\alpha(p) = 1/3$ and $f(p) = p(1/3) - p/3 + 3 = 3$. This is a monofractal spectrum: a single Hölder exponent $\\alpha=1/3$ exists, and the set of points with this exponent fills the entire space (dimension $3$). The spectrum width $\\Delta\\alpha$ is zero.\n\nFor the intermittent models (Lognormal and She-Leveque), $\\zeta(p)$ is a non-linear, concave function. This results in a range of Hölder exponents $\\alpha$ and a non-trivial spectrum $f(\\alpha)$ with $\\Delta\\alpha > 0$. The maximum of the spectrum, $f_{\\max}$, should be equal to the space dimension $d=3$, corresponding to the most probable singularity, which occupies the largest volume fraction of the flow.",
