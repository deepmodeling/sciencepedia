            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Stefan-Boltzmann law from Planck's law of blackbody radiation and subsequently, a numerical calculation of the hemispherical emissive power for a given temperature.\n\nThe spectral radiance of a blackbody at temperature $T$ as a function of wavelength $\\lambda$ is given by Planck's law:\n$$L_{\\lambda,b}(\\lambda, T) = \\frac{2hc^2}{\\lambda^5[\\exp(\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}) - 1]}$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, and $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant.\n\nThe hemispherical emissive power, $E_b$, is the total radiative flux emitted from a surface into the hemisphere above it. It is defined by integrating the directional radiance $L_b(\\theta, \\phi)$ over all solid angles of the hemisphere. For a diffuse surface, the radiance is isotropic, i.e., independent of direction $(\\theta, \\phi)$. Thus, $L_b$ can be taken out of the angular integral.\nThe spectral hemispherical emissive power, $E_{\\lambda,b}$, is related to the spectral radiance, $L_{\\lambda,b}$, by:\n$$E_{\\lambda,b} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} L_{\\lambda,b} \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta \\,d\\phi$$\nSince the surface is diffuse, $L_{\\lambda,b}$ is constant with respect to direction.

The derivation must start from the fundamental principles of radiative heat transfer.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant quantities based on first principles. The hemispherical emissive power of a real surface, $M(T)$, is the integral of the directional emitted intensity, $I(\\theta, \\phi, T)$, over the hemisphere above the surface. The intensity is projected onto the surface by a factor of $\\cos\\theta$.
