            "problem": "Consider two large, parallel, planar, diffuse, opaque surfaces, labeled surface $1$ and surface $2$, forming a two-surface enclosure in a non-participating medium (the medium does not absorb, emit, or scatter radiation). The outward unit normal of surface $1$ points toward surface $2$ and vice versa. The gap between the planes is finite and equal to $d>0$, but the lateral extents are so large that edge effects are negligible in the sense of the radiosity method for surface-to-surface radiation. The surfaces are isothermal and the radiation exchange is steady. The surfaces exhibit diffuse (Lambertian) behavior.\n\nStarting strictly from the fundamental definition that the configuration factor (view factor) $F_{ij}$ is the fraction of the total radiant energy leaving surface $i$ that reaches surface $j$ directly, and using only conservation of energy for an enclosure, reciprocity, and geometric visibility consistent with a non-participating medium, derive the value of the view factor $F_{12}$ between the two planes. Then, establish whether any part of the radiant energy leaving surface $1$ can directly return to surface $1$ and use this to determine $F_{11}$.\n\nYour reasoning must be grounded in first principles and must not invoke any shortcut formulas or tabulated results. Express the final answer for the ordered pair $(F_{12}, F_{11})$ exactly, as a dimensionless quantity. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the view factors $F_{12}$ and $F_{11}$ for two large, parallel, planar surfaces forming a two-surface enclosure. The derivation must proceed from first principles, namely the fundamental definition of a view factor, the principle of energy conservation for an enclosure, and geometric reasoning.\n\nFirst, let us address the determination of the self-view factor, $F_{11}$, by considering whether any part of the radiant energy leaving surface $1$ can directly return to surface $1$. The view factor $F_{ij}$ is defined as the fraction of the total radiant energy leaving surface $i$ that directly strikes surface $j$. Thus, $F_{11}$ is the fraction of energy leaving surface $1$ that strikes surface $1$ directly.\n\nThe problem states that surface $1$ is planar. It also specifies a non-participating medium, in which radiation travels in straight lines. By the geometric properties of a plane, any straight line (or ray) originating from a point on the plane and directed into the half-space on one side of the plane can never intersect that plane again. A surface must be concave to have a non-zero self-view factor, as this allows one part of the surface to \"see\" another part. Since surface $1$ is planar (zero curvature), it cannot see itself. Therefore, no radiation leaving any point on surface $1$ can travel in a straight line and strike any other point on surface $1$. This means that the fraction of energy leaving surface $1$ that directly returns to surface $1$ is zero.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$F_{11} = 0$$\n\nNext, we apply the principle of conservation of energy to the enclosure. For any surface $i$ that is part of an enclosure composed of $N$ surfaces, all the radiant energy leaving surface $i$ must be intercepted by the surfaces of the enclosure. This is known as the summation rule for view factors:\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} = 1$$\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the two large, parallel planes form a two-surface enclosure. This is an idealization where the lateral extents are considered infinite, so no energy is lost to the surroundings. In this context, our enclosure consists of $N=2$ surfaces: surface $1$ and surface $2$.\n\nApplying the summation rule to surface $1$ (i.e., setting $i=1$), we have:\n$$F_{11} + F_{12} = 1$$\n\nWe have already established through geometric reasoning that $F_{11} = 0$. Substituting this result into the summation rule equation yields:\n$$0 + F_{12} = 1$$\nThis directly leads to the conclusion that:\n$$F_{12} = 1$$\n\nThis result has a clear physical interpretation: since surface $1$ is a plane and cannot see itself, and since the only other surface in the enclosure is surface $2$, all radiation leaving surface $1$ must, by necessity, be intercepted by surface $2$.\n\nThe problem also mentions reciprocity. The reciprocity theorem states that $A_i F_{ij} = A_j F_{ji}$, where $A_i$ and $A_j$ are the areas of the respective surfaces. For two infinite parallel planes, we can consider two equal, arbitrary areas $A_1 = A_2 = A$. The reciprocity relation would be $A F_{12} = A F_{21}$, which implies $F_{12} = F_{21}$. Our result gives $F_{12}=1$, so reciprocity demands $F_{21}=1$. This is consistent, as the same logic applies to surface $2$: it is planar, so $F_{22}=0$, and by the summation rule for surface $2$, $F_{21} + F_{22} = 1$, which gives $F_{21}=1$. The derivation is internally consistent.\n\nThe problem asks for the ordered pair $(F_{12}, F_{11})$. Based on the derivation from first principles:\n$F_{12} = 1$\n$F_{11} = 0$\n\nThus, the ordered pair is $(1, 0)$.",

            "problem": "A diffuse-gray, isothermal three-surface enclosure in a non-participating medium is constructed as follows. Surface $1$ is a perfectly diffuse, opaque sphere of radius $R_1$ centered at the origin. Surface $2$ is a perfectly diffuse, opaque, infinitesimally thin concentric spherical shell of radius $R_2$ that completely surrounds surface $1$, except that it has a circular aperture centered on the positive $z$-axis; the aperture is a spherical cap on the $R_2$ sphere subtending a half-angle $\\theta_0$ at the center. Surface $3$ is a perfectly diffuse, opaque, infinitesimally thin concentric spherical shell of radius $R_3$ that completely surrounds surface $2$. The medium between surfaces is vacuum and thus non-participating. All surfaces are black for simplicity (unit emissivity), but you are to work only with view factors (geometric configuration factors).

            "solution": "The goal is to find the view factors $F_{13}$ and $F_{31}$ for the described three-surface enclosure.\n\n**1. Calculation of View Factor $F_{13}$**\n\nThe view factor $F_{13}$ represents the fraction of radiative energy leaving the inner sphere (surface 1) that directly strikes the outer sphere (surface 3). Since surface 2 is an opaque shell, radiation can only pass from surface 1 to surface 3 through the aperture in surface 2. Therefore, the view factor from surface 1 to surface 3 is identical to the view factor from surface 1 to the aperture.\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry of diffuse radiation from a concentric sphere, the irradiation from the inner sphere (1) is uniform over the entire surface of any concentric sphere outside it. This means the fraction of energy from surface 1 intercepted by the aperture is simply the ratio of the aperture's area ($A_{aperture}$) to the total area of a complete sphere at radius $R_2$ ($A_{2,total}$).\n$$F_{13} = \\frac{A_{aperture}}{A_{2,total}}$$\nThe aperture is a spherical cap with a half-angle $\\theta_0$. Its area is given by $A_{aperture} = 2\\pi R_2^2 (1 - \\cos\\theta_0)$. The total area of the sphere at radius $R_2$ is $A_{2,total} = 4\\pi R_2^2$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $F_{13}$:\n$$F_{13} = \\frac{2\\pi R_2^2 (1 - \\cos\\theta_0)}{4\\pi R_2^2} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta_0}{2}$$\nUsing the given value $\\theta_0 = 60^\\circ$ ($\\cos(60^\\circ) = 0.5$):\n$$F_{13} = \\frac{1 - 0.5}{2} = 0.25$$\n\n**2. Verification of the Summation Rule for Surface 1**\n\nThe summation rule for surface 1 in this three-surface enclosure is $F_{11} + F_{12} + F_{13} = 1$. Since surface 1 is a convex sphere, it cannot see itself, so $F_{11} = 0$. The rule simplifies to $F_{12} + F_{13} = 1$. This means the view factor to surface 2 is $F_{12} = 1 - F_{13} = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\nThis physically represents that all radiation leaving the inner sphere is intercepted by either the solid part of surface 2 ($F_{12}$) or passes through its aperture to strike surface 3 ($F_{13}$). The calculation is consistent as per the problem's request to demonstrate the summation rule.\n\n**3. Calculation of View Factor $F_{31}$**\n\nThe view factor $F_{31}$ is found using the reciprocity relation: $A_1 F_{13} = A_3 F_{31}$.\nThe areas of the spherical surfaces are $A_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2$ and $A_3 = 4\\pi R_3^2$.\nRearranging for $F_{31}$:\n$$F_{31} = F_{13} \\frac{A_1}{A_3} = F_{13} \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2}{4\\pi R_3^2} = F_{13} \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_3}\\right)^2$$\nSubstituting the numerical values: $F_{13} = 0.25$, $R_1 = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $R_3 = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$F_{31} = 0.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{0.40}{1.20}\\right)^2 = 0.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{1}{36}$$\nAs a decimal, $F_{31} = \\frac{1}{36} \\approx 0.027777...$\n\n**4.

The principles of radiative heat transfer in an enclosure are correctly stated. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe analysis is based on the radiosity method for an enclosure of $N$ diffuse-gray surfaces. The fundamental equations are:\n1.  **Radiosity**, $J_i$: The total radiant flux leaving surface $i$, which is the sum of emitted and reflected flux.\n    $$J_i = \\varepsilon_i E_{b,i} + \\rho_i G_i$$\n    where $\\varepsilon_i$ is the emissivity, $\\rho_i$ is the reflectivity, $E_{b,i} = \\sigma T_i^4$ is the blackbody emissive power, and $G_i$ is the irradiation.

The irradiation $G_3$ is given by:\n$$G_3 = F_{31}J_1 + F_{32}J_2 + F_{33}J_3 = 0.5(J_1 + J_2)$$\nSince surfaces $1$ and $2$ are at high temperatures and have non-zero emissivities, their radiosities $J_1$ and $J_2$ will be large positive values. Therefore, $G_3$ will be a large positive value, and consequently, $J_3$ will also be a large positive value. It will not approach zero. The reflected component $(1-\\varepsilon_3)G_3$ dominates the radiosity for a low-emissivity surface.\n\nVerdict for E: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option B Analysis**\n\nThe statement is: \"For the given enclosure and parameters, in the limit $\\varepsilon_3 \\to 0$, $q_2'' \\approx -4.19 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$.\"\n\nThis requires a quantitative calculation. First, we compute the blackbody emissive powers:\n$$E_{b,1} = \\sigma T_1^4 = (5.67 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-4}})(1200\\,\\mathrm{K})^4 = 117565.92\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$$\n$$E_{b,2} = \\sigma T_2^4 = (5.67 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-4}})(800\\,\\mathrm{K})^4 = 23224.32\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$$\nIn the limit $\\varepsilon_3 \\to 0$, the system of radiosity equations becomes:\n1) $J_1 = \\varepsilon_1 E_{b,1} + 0.5(1-\\varepsilon_1)(J_2+J_3)$\n2) $J_2 = \\varepsilon_2 E_{b,2} + 0.5(1-\\varepsilon_2)(J_1+J_3)$\n3) $J_3 = 0.5(J_1+J_2)$\n\nSubstitute (3) into (1) and (2) to get a 2-surface problem with a reradiating surface:\n1) $J_1 = \\varepsilon_1 E_{b,1} + 0.5(1-\\varepsilon_1)(J_2 + 0.5(J_1+J_2)) = \\varepsilon_1 E_{b,1} + (1-\\varepsilon_1)(0.25 J_1 + 0.75 J_2)$\n2) $J_2 = \\varepsilon_2 E_{b,2} + 0.5(1-\\varepsilon_2)(J_1 + 0.5(J_1+J_2)) = \\varepsilon_2 E_{b,2} + (1-\\varepsilon_2)(0.75 J_1 + 0.25 J_2)$\n\nRearranging these into a $2 \\times 2$ system for $J_1$ and $J_2$:\n1) $J_1 (1 - 0.25(1-\\varepsilon_1)) - 0.75(1-\\varepsilon_1)J_2 = \\varepsilon_1 E_{b,1}$\n2) $-0.75(1-\\varepsilon_2)J_1 + J_2(1 - 0.25(1-\\varepsilon_2)) = \\varepsilon_2 E_{b,2}$\n\nPlugging in $\\varepsilon_1=0.8$ and $\\varepsilon_2=0.6$:\n1) $J_1 (1 - 0.25(0.2)) - 0.75(0.2)J_2 = 0.8 E_{b,1} \\implies 0.95 J_1 - 0.15 J_2 = 0.8(117565.92) = 94052.736$\n2) $-0.3 J_1 + J_2(1 - 0.25(0.4)) = 0.6 E_{b,2} \\implies -0.3 J_1 + 0.9 J_2 = 0.6(23224.32) = 13934.592$\n\nWe have the system:\n$$ 0.95 J_1 - 0.15 J_2 = 94052.736 $$\n$$ -0.30 J_1 + 0.90 J_2 = 13934.592 $$\nSolving this system (e.g., using Cramer's rule or substitution), we found in the C-analysis that the determinant is $0.81$.\nSolving for $J_2$:\n$$ J_2 = \\frac{\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0.95 & 94052.736 \\\\ -0.30 & 13934.592 \\end{pmatrix}}{0.81} = \\frac{0.95(13934.592) - (-0.30)(94052.736)}{0.81} $$\n$$ J_2 = \\frac{13237.8624 + 28215.8208}{0.81} = \\frac{41453.6832}{0.81} \\approx 51177.39\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2} $$\nNow we calculate the net heat flux $q_2''$:\n$$ q_2'' = \\frac{\\varepsilon_2}{1-\\varepsilon_2}(E_{b,2} - J_2) = \\frac{0.6}{1-0.6}(23224.32 - 51177.39)\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2} $$\n$$ q_2'' = \\frac{0.6}{0.4}(-27953.07)\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2} = 1.5(-27953.07)\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2} \\approx -41929.6\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2} $$\nThis value is approximately $-4.19 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$. The statement is consistent with our calculation.\n\nVerdict for B: **Correct**.\n\nSummary of Correct Statements:\nStatements A, B, and D are correct.\nStatement C is incorrect because the system remains non-singular.\nStatement E is incorrect because the reflected radiation term dominates the radiosity of a highly reflective surface.",
