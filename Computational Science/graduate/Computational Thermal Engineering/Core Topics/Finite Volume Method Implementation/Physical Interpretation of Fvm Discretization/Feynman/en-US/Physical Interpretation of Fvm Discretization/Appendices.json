            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\nThe derivation begins with the integral form of the energy conservation principle applied to a control volume under steady-state conditions with no internal heat generation. The net heat rate out of any control volume through its surface $S$ must be zero. For the specific task of finding the heat rate across a single face $f$, we focus on the heat flux across that face.\n\nThe diffusive heat rate, $\\dot{Q}_f$, crossing the face $f$ from the control volume centered at $P$ to the one centered at $N$ is given by the integral of the heat flux vector, $\\mathbf{q}$, dotted with the face normal vector, $\\mathbf{n}_f$, over the face area, $A_f$.\n$$ \\dot{Q}_f = \\int_{A_f} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_f \\, dA $$\nThe direction of $\\mathbf{n}_f$ is specified as pointing from $P$ to $N$, which correctly aligns with the definition of $\\dot{Q}_f$ as the heat rate from $P$ to $N$.\n\nFourier's law of heat conduction relates the heat flux vector $\\mathbf{q}$ to the temperature gradient $\\nabla T$. For an isotropic material with thermal conductivity $k$, this law is:\n$$ \\mathbf{q} = -k \\nabla T $$\nSubstituting Fourier's law into the expression for the heat rate gives:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_f = \\int_{A_f} (-k \\nabla T) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_f \\, dA $$\nThe problem states that the solid is homogeneous, meaning the thermal conductivity $k$ is constant throughout the domain. Therefore, $k$ can be moved outside the integral:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_f = -k \\int_{A_f} (\\nabla T \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_f) \\, dA $$\nThe term $\\nabla T \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_f$ represents the component of the temperature gradient in the direction normal to the face $f$, which is the directional derivative of temperature, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n_f}$.\n$$ \\dot{Q}_f = -k \\int_{A_f} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n_f} \\, dA $$\nTo evaluate this integral in a discrete numerical context, the Finite Volume Method requires an approximation for the temperature gradient at the face, $\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n_f}\\right)_f$. We assume that this gradient is constant over the planar face $f$ and can be approximated using the cell-average temperatures $T_P$ and $T_N$ at the adjacent centroids. This is a primary FVM assumption.\n$$ \\dot{Q}_f \\approx -k \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n_f} \\right)_f \\int_{A_f} dA = -k A_f \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n_f} \\right)_f $$\nThe gradient itself is approximated using a finite difference scheme. The problem specifies an orthogonal mesh, meaning the line connecting the centroids $P$ and $N$ is perpendicular to the face $f$. The distance between these centroids is the projected separation $d_f$. A second-order central difference approximation for the gradient at the face $f$, located midway between $P$ and $N$, is:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n_f} \\right)_f \\approx \\frac{T_N - T_P}{d_f} $$\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for $\\dot{Q}_f$:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_f \\approx -k A_f \\left( \\frac{T_N - T_P}{d_f} \\right) $$\nTo match the required form $\\dot{Q}_f = G_f \\,\\Delta T_f$ with $\\Delta T_f = (T_P - T_N)$, we rearrange the expression:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_f = \\frac{k A_f}{d_f} (T_P - T_N) $$\nBy direct comparison with the target form $\\dot{Q}_f = G_f (T_P - T_N)$, we identify the effective face thermal conductance $G_f$ as:\n$$ G_f = \\frac{k A_f}{d_f} $$\n\n### Physical Interpretation\nThe derived expression for the discrete heat rate, $\\dot{Q}_f = \\frac{k A_f}{d_f} (T_P - T_N)$, is analogous to Ohm's law for electrical circuits, $I = \\frac{\\Delta V}{R_e}$, where current $I$ is analogous to heat rate $\\dot{Q}_f$, and voltage potential difference $\\Delta V$ is analogous to temperature difference $\\Delta T_f = T_P - T_N$.\n\nIn this analogy, the term multiplying the temperature difference is the thermal conductance, $G_f$. The reciprocal of conductance is resistance. Thus, the effective thermal resistance, $R_{th,f}$, between the nodes $P$ and $N$ is:\n$$ R_{th,f} = \\frac{1}{G_f} = \\frac{d_f}{k A_f} $$\nThis expression is identical to the well-known formula for the one-dimensional conductive thermal resistance of a plane wall of thickness $d_f$, cross-sectional area $A_f$, and thermal conductivity $k$.\n\nTherefore, the physical interpretation of the FVM discretization for this simple case is that the thermal path between two adjacent cell centroids, $P$ and $N$, is modeled as a simple thermal resistor. The heat transfer between the two nodes is governed by the temperature difference between them and the thermal resistance of this path. The value of this resistance is determined by the material's thermal conductivity and the geometry (distance and face area) separating the nodes. This two-node thermal resistance network is a cornerstone of simplified heat transfer analysis and provides a clear physical meaning to the discrete equations generated by the\nFinite Volume Method.",

The term $(\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_w$ represents the component of the heat flux vector in the direction of the outward normal, which corresponds to heat leaving $V_P$. Since $q_n$ is defined as entering, the exiting flux is its negative:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_w = -q_n\n$$\nThe problem statement confirms the sign convention by noting that the outward normal on the west face points opposite to the direction of the entering flux.\n\nAt the east interior face (e), the heat flux is governed by Fourier's law of heat conduction for an isotropic medium: $\\mathbf{q} = -k \\nabla T$, where $k$ is the constant thermal conductivity.
