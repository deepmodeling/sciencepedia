            "problem": "Consider steady heat conduction in a solid with isotropic and spatially uniform thermal conductivity $k$ governed by the conservation of energy and Fourier’s law of heat conduction. A single control volume cell $P$ belongs to an unstructured polyhedral mesh. The cell $P$ has two faces: one boundary face $f$ on which a Dirichlet boundary condition is prescribed, and one internal face $g$ adjoining a neighboring cell $N$. The outward unit normal $\\mathbf{n}$ on each face is defined with respect to cell $P$. The Finite Volume Method (FVM) is used to discretize the diffusion operator on this unstructured grid.\n\nGiven data are:\n- Thermal conductivity: $k = 12$.\n- Boundary face area: $A_{f} = 0.075$.\n- Centroid-to-face-center distance for the boundary face: $d_{P f} = 0.018$.\n- Prescribed boundary temperature at face $f$: $T_{b} = 375$.\n- Internal face area: $A_{g} = 0.062$.\n- Centroid-to-centroid normal distance between cells $P$ and $N$ across face $g$: $d_{P N} = 0.027$.\n- Neighboring cell-center temperature: $T_{N} = 398$.\n\nStarting from the conservation law $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0$ and Fourier’s law $\\mathbf{q} = -k \\nabla T$, integrate over the control volume and use the divergence theorem to obtain a face-based balance.

            "solution": "### Derivation of the Discrete Equation\nThe governing equation for steady heat conduction with constant thermal conductivity $k$ is derived by combining the conservation of energy and Fourier's law:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (-k \\nabla T) = 0 $$\nFor the Finite Volume Method, we integrate this equation over the control volume $V_P$ of cell $P$:\n$$ \\int_{V_P} \\nabla \\cdot (-k \\nabla T) dV = 0 $$\nApplying the divergence theorem, we convert the volume integral into a surface integral over the boundary $\\partial V_P$ of the control volume:\n$$ \\int_{\\partial V_P} (-k \\nabla T) \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = 0 $$\nwhere $d\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{n} dS$ is the outward-pointing surface area element vector. The boundary of cell $P$ consists of two faces, $f$ and $g$. The integral can thus be written as a sum of integrals over these faces:\n$$ \\int_{S_f} (-k \\nabla T) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_f dS + \\int_{S_g} (-k \\nabla T) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_g dS = 0 $$\nAssuming the flux is uniform over each face, this simplifies to an algebraic balance of heat rates, $Q$, flowing out of the cell through each face:\n$$ Q_f + Q_g = 0 $$\nwhere $Q_j = (-k \\nabla T \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_j A_j$ is the net heat rate out of face $j$.\n\nWe now approximate the normal component of the temperature gradient at each face center using a two-point central difference scheme.\n\n**Contribution from Boundary Face $f$**\nThe heat rate out of face $f$ is $Q_f$. The normal gradient is approximated using the cell-center temperature $T_P$ and the prescribed boundary temperature $T_b$ at the face center:\n$$ (\\nabla T \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_f \\approx \\frac{T_b - T_P}{d_{Pf}} $$\nHere, the vectors are aligned such that the outward normal from P points towards the boundary, but the standard FVM formulation for the flux from $P$ to the face is written based on the temperature difference from inside to outside. The heat rate *out of* cell $P$ through face $f$ is:\n$$ Q_f = -k A_f \\left( \\frac{T_b - T_P}{d_{Pf}} \\right) = k \\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} (T_P - T_b) $$\nThis term's contribution to the discrete equation for cell $P$ is $k \\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} T_P - k \\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} T_b$. Following the standard FVM discrete form $a_P T_P = \\sum a_{nb} T_{nb} + S_u$, we can identify the terms. The coefficient $k \\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}}$ contributes to the main diagonal coefficient $a_P$. The term $-k \\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} T_b$ is a source term, which is moved to the right-hand side of the algebraic equation, contributing $k \\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} T_b$ to the source vector.\n\n**Contribution from Internal Face $g$**\nSimilarly, the heat rate out of face $g$ into the neighboring cell $N$ is $Q_g$. The normal gradient is approximated using the temperatures of the two adjacent cell centers, $T_P$ and $T_N$:\n$$ (\\nabla T \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_g \\approx \\frac{T_N - T_P}{d_{PN}} $$\nThe heat rate out of cell $P$ through face $g$ is:\n$$ Q_g = -k A_g \\left( \\frac{T_N - T_P}{d_{PN}} \\right) = k \\frac{A_g}{d_{PN}} (T_P - T_N) $$\n\n**Assembled Discrete Balance for Cell $P$**\nThe energy balance $Q_f + Q_g = 0$ becomes:\n$$ k \\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} (T_P - T_b) + k \\frac{A_g}{d_{PN}} (T_P - T_N) = 0 $$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $T_P$:\n$$ \\left( k \\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} + k \\frac{A_g}{d_{PN}} \\right) T_P = k \\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} T_b + k \\frac{A_g}{d_{PN}} T_N $$\nThe thermal conductivity $k$ is a common factor and cancels out:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} + \\frac{A_g}{d_{PN}} \\right) T_P = \\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} T_b + \\frac{A_g}{d_{PN}} T_N $$\nSolving for $T_P$:\n$$ T_P = \\frac{\\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} T_b + \\frac{A_g}{d_{PN}} T_N}{\\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} + \\frac{A_g}{d_{PN}}} $$\nThis shows that $T_P$ is a weighted average of the neighboring temperatures, where the weights are the geometric conductances $A/d$.\n\n### Calculation of $T_P$\nWe substitute the given numerical values. First, we compute the geometric conductances:\n$$ C_f = \\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} = \\frac{0.075}{0.018} = \\frac{75}{18} = \\frac{25}{6} $$\n$$ C_g = \\frac{A_g}{d_{PN}} = \\frac{0.062}{0.027} = \\frac{62}{27} $$\nNow we substitute these into the expression for $T_P$:\n$$ T_P = \\frac{C_f T_b + C_g T_N}{C_f + C_g} = \\frac{(\\frac{25}{6})(375) + (\\frac{62}{27})(398)}{\\frac{25}{6} + \\frac{62}{27}} $$\nNumerator:\n$$ (\\frac{25}{6})(375) + (\\frac{62}{27})(398) = \\frac{3125}{2} + \\frac{24676}{27} = \\frac{3125 \\times 27 + 24676 \\times 2}{54} = \\frac{84375 + 49352}{54} = \\frac{133727}{54} $$\nDenominator:\n$$ \\frac{25}{6} + \\frac{62}{27} = \\frac{25 \\times 9 + 62 \\times 2}{54} = \\frac{225 + 124}{54} = \\frac{349}{54} $$\nThus, the cell-center temperature $T_P$ is:\n$$ T_P = \\frac{133727 / 54}{349 / 54} = \\frac{133727}{349} \\approx 383.171919... \\, \\mathrm{K} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $T_P = 383.2 \\, \\mathrm{K}$.\n\n### Verification of Local Conservation\nTo verify local conservation, we must compute the outward heat rates $Q_f$ and $Q_g$ and show that their sum is zero. We use the exact value of $T_P = \\frac{133727}{349}$ to avoid rounding errors in the verification.\nThe coefficients multiplying the temperature differences are $a_f = k C_f$ and $a_g = k C_g$:\n$$ a_f = k \\frac{A_f}{d_{Pf}} = 12 \\left(\\frac{25}{6}\\right) = 50 $$\n$$ a_g = k \\frac{A_g}{d_{PN}} = 12 \\left(\\frac{62}{27}\\right) = 4 \\left(\\frac{62}{9}\\right) = \\frac{248}{9} $$\nNow, we compute the heat rates:\n$$ Q_f = a_f (T_P - T_b) = 50 \\left( \\frac{133727}{349} - 375 \\right) = 50 \\left( \\frac{133727 - 375 \\times 349}{349} \\right) = 50 \\left( \\frac{133727 - 130875}{349} \\right) = 50 \\left( \\frac{2852}{349} \\right) = \\frac{142600}{349} $$\n$$ Q_g = a_g (T_P - T_N) = \\frac{248}{9} \\left( \\frac{133727}{349} - 398 \\right) = \\frac{248}{9} \\left( \\frac{133727 - 398 \\times 349}{349} \\right) = \\frac{248}{9} \\left( \\frac{133727 - 138902}{349} \\right) = \\frac{248}{9} \\left( \\frac{-5175}{349} \\right) $$\nSince $5+1+7+5 = 18$, $5175$ is divisible by $9$: $5175 \\div 9 = 575$.\n$$ Q_g = 248 \\left( \\frac{-575}{349} \\right) = \\frac{-142600}{349} $$\nThe sum of the outward heat rates is:\n$$ Q_f + Q_g = \\frac{142600}{349} + \\frac{-142600}{349} = 0 $$\nThe local conservation of energy for cell $P$ is satisfied, thus verifying the solution for $T_P$. The final reported value is the numerically rounded temperature.",

Since both the nonpositive off-diagonal condition (due to $a_{PN_3}$) and the diagonal dominance condition are violated, the value of the indicator is $1$.\n$$ I = 1 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the monotonicity margin $M$, which is defined as the difference between the diagonal entry and the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal entries.\n$$ M = a_{PP} - \\sum_{j=1}^{5} |a_{PN_{j}}| $$\nUsing the values calculated above:\n$$ M = 11.2 - 12.4 = -1.2 \\, \\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{K} $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $-1.2$ can be expressed as $-1.200$ to explicitly show four significant figures.\n$$ M = -1.200 \\, \\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{K} $$\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a row matrix containing $M$ and $I$.",
