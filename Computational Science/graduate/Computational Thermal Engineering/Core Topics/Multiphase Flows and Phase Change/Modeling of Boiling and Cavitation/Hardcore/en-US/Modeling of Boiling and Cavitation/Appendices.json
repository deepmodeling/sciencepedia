No units are required in the final numeric answer.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically sound, self-contained, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard application of fundamental principles in fluid mechanics, namely the conservation of mass and the Bernoulli equation, to analyze the potential for cavitation in a Venturi tube. All necessary data are provided, and the assumptions are clearly stated and physically appropriate for an introductory analysis. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe analysis begins with the principle of conservation of mass for a steady, incompressible flow. The continuity equation states that the mass flow rate is constant throughout the conduit. For an incompressible fluid where the density $\\rho$ is constant, this simplifies to the conservation of volume flow rate:\n$$\nA_{1}V_{1} = A_{t}V_{t}\n$$\nwhere the subscript $1$ denotes conditions at the inlet and the subscript $t$ denotes conditions at the throat. From this, we can express the throat velocity $V_{t}$ in terms of the inlet velocity $V_{1}$ and the area ratio:\n$$\nV_{t} = V_{1} \\frac{A_{1}}{A_{t}}\n$$\nGiven the inlet speed $V_{1}=2\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ and the area ratio $A_{1}/A_{t}=4$, the velocity at the throat is:\n$$\nV_{t} = (2\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) \\times 4 = 8\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\nNext, we apply the Bernoulli equation for a steady, inviscid, incompressible flow along a horizontal streamline (no change in elevation, $z_{1}=z_{t}$). The equation relates pressure and velocity between the inlet and the throat:\n$$\np_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_{1}^{2} = p_{t} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_{t}^{2}\n$$\nThe problem requires the derivation of the local static pressure in the throat, $p_{t}$. Rearranging the Bernoulli equation yields:\n$$\np_{t} = p_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho \\left(V_{1}^{2} - V_{t}^{2}\\right)\n$$\nWe can substitute the numerical values provided: $p_{1}=200\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 200000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\rho=998\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$, $V_{1}=2\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, and the derived value $V_{t}=8\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n$$\np_{t} = 200000\\,\\mathrm{Pa} + \\frac{1}{2}(998\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}) \\left( (2\\,\\mathrm{m/s})^{2} - (8\\,\\mathrm{m/s})^{2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\np_{t} = 200000\\,\\mathrm{Pa} + (499\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}) \\left( 4\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s^{2}} - 64\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s^{2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\np_{t} = 200000\\,\\mathrm{Pa} + (499\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}) (-60\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s^{2}})\n$$\n$$\np_{t} = 200000\\,\\mathrm{Pa} - 29940\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 170060\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nThis corresponds to a throat pressure of $p_{t}=170.06\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n\nCavitation is the phenomenon of phase change from liquid to vapor that occurs when the local static pressure of the liquid drops to or below its saturation vapor pressure, $p_{v}$, at the prevailing temperature. From first principles, boiling occurs not just with increasing temperature, but also with decreasing pressure. Therefore, the criterion for the inception of cavitation at any point in the flow is:\n$$\np_{\\text{local}} \\le p_{v}\n$$\nIn a Venturi tube, the minimum pressure occurs at the throat, where the velocity is maximum. Thus, for this system, cavitation would begin to occur at the throat if $p_{t} \\le p_{v}$.\n\nGiven the saturation vapor pressure $p_{v}=2.3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$, we compare it with the calculated throat pressure $p_{t}=170.06\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$. Since $p_{t} > p_{v}$, the pressure in the throat does not fall to the vapor pressure, and therefore, cavitation does not occur under the specified conditions.\n\nThe cavitation number at the throat, $\\sigma_{t}$, is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the margin against cavitation. It is defined as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{t} = \\frac{p_{t} - p_{v}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_{t}^{2}}\n$$\nThe numerator, $p_{t} - p_{v}$, represents the pressure difference above the vapor pressure. The denominator, $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho V_{t}^{2}$, is the dynamic pressure at the throat, which serves as a characteristic pressure scale for the flow. The cavitation inception criterion $p_{t} \\le p_{v}$ is equivalent to $p_{t} - p_{v} \\le 0$. Since the denominator is always positive for a non-zero flow, the criterion for cavitation inception can be equivalently stated in terms of the cavitation number as $\\sigma_{t} \\le 0$.\n\nWe can now calculate the value of $\\sigma_{t}$ using the previously determined values.

            "problem": "In saturated pool boiling of water at atmospheric pressure on a polished copper surface, the nucleation site density $N_{s}$ (number of vapor nucleation sites per unit area) depends on the wall superheat $\\Delta T = T_{w} - T_{\\text{sat}}$, where $T_{w}$ is the wall temperature and $T_{\\text{sat}}$ is the saturation temperature. Consider a microrough copper surface whose cavities can be modeled as axisymmetric features with a distribution of mouth radii $r$. The activation of a cavity is governed by the thermodynamic stability of a vapor embryo subject to the capillary pressure described by the Young–Laplace relation and the local equilibrium of vapor pressure described by the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. Assume the following:\n- The capillary pressure for a vapor bubble of curvature radius $r_{b}$ is $2\\sigma / r_{b}$, where $\\sigma$ is the surface tension.\n- Near saturation, the vapor pressure responds to temperature as $p_{v}(T) \\approx p_{\\text{sat}} + \\left(\\frac{dp_{\\text{sat}}}{dT}\\right)_{T_{\\text{sat}}} \\Delta T$, where $\\Delta T = T - T_{\\text{sat}}$ and $p_{\\text{sat}}$ is the saturation pressure. The Clausius–Clapeyron relation gives $\\frac{dp_{\\text{sat}}}{dT} = \\frac{h_{lv}}{T_{\\text{sat}}(v_{v} - v_{l})}$, with $h_{lv}$ the latent heat of vaporization and $v_{v}$, $v_{l}$ the specific volumes of vapor and liquid, respectively.

            "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts. The first part requires the derivation of the scaling law for nucleation site density, $N_{s}$, with respect to wall superheat, $\\Delta T$. The second part involves a numerical calculation of $N_{s}$ using an empirically-provided correlation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Scaling Law**\n\nThe activation of a surface cavity as a vapor nucleation site is determined by a force balance on the vapor-liquid interface of an embryonic bubble. A bubble can grow from a cavity of mouth radius $r$ only if the vapor pressure inside the bubble, $p_{v}$, is sufficient to overcome the pressure of the surrounding liquid, $p_{l}$, and the surface tension-induced capillary pressure, $p_{cap}$. At the onset of boiling in a saturated liquid, the liquid pressure is the saturation pressure, $p_{sat}$, and the vapor temperature is assumed to be the wall temperature, $T_w$. The activation criterion is therefore:\n$$p_{v}(T_{w}) \\ge p_{sat} + p_{cap}$$\nThe problem provides the necessary relations. The capillary pressure is given by the Young-Laplace equation for a bubble of curvature radius $r_b$:\n$$p_{cap} = \\frac{2\\sigma}{r_b}$$\nThe vapor pressure's dependence on temperature near saturation is given by a linearized form of the saturation curve:\n$$p_{v}(T_{w}) \\approx p_{sat} + \\left(\\frac{dp_{sat}}{dT}\\right)_{T_{sat}} \\Delta T$$\nwhere $\\Delta T = T_w - T_{sat}$ is the wall superheat.\n\nSubstituting these into the activation criterion:\n$$p_{sat} + \\left(\\frac{dp_{sat}}{dT}\\right)_{T_{sat}} \\Delta T \\ge p_{sat} + \\frac{2\\sigma}{r_b}$$\nThis simplifies to a condition on the minimum superheat required to activate a bubble of a given curvature radius:\n$$\\left(\\frac{dp_{sat}}{dT}\\right)_{T_{sat}} \\Delta T \\ge \\frac{2\\sigma}{r_b}$$\nThe problem provides a simplified form of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, assuming the specific volume of vapor $v_v$ is much larger than that of liquid $v_l$:\n$$\\frac{dp_{sat}}{dT} \\approx \\frac{h_{lv}}{T_{sat}v_{v}} = \\frac{h_{lv}\\rho_{v}}{T_{sat}}$$\nwhere $h_{lv}$ is the latent heat of vaporization and $\\rho_v$ is the vapor density. Furthermore, a geometric factor $\\gamma$ relates the bubble curvature radius $r_b$ to the cavity mouth radius $r$:\n$$r_b = \\gamma r$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the inequality gives the condition for a cavity of radius $r$ to be active:\n$$\\frac{h_{lv}\\rho_{v}}{T_{sat}} \\Delta T \\ge \\frac{2\\sigma}{\\gamma r}$$\nFor a given superheat $\\Delta T$, there is a critical cavity radius, $r_c$, which is the minimum radius of a cavity that can be activated. This critical radius is found by setting the inequality to an equality:\n$$\\frac{h_{lv}\\rho_{v}}{T_{sat}} \\Delta T = \\frac{2\\sigma}{\\gamma r_c}$$\nSolving for $r_c$ yields:\n$$r_c = \\left(\\frac{2\\sigma T_{sat}}{h_{lv}\\rho_{v}\\gamma}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\Delta T}$$\nAll cavities with a mouth radius $r \\ge r_c$ will be active nucleation sites. The total number of active nucleation sites per unit area, $N_s$, is found by integrating the cavity size distribution function, $n(r)$, from the critical radius $r_c$ up to the maximum available cavity radius, $r_{max}$.\n$$N_s = \\int_{r_c}^{r_{max}} n(r) \\, dr$$\nThe problem specifies a power-law distribution for the cavity radii: $n(r) = C r^{-p}$ for $r \\in [r_{min}, r_{max}]$, where $C$ and $p$ are positive constants. Performing the integration with this distribution:\n$$N_s = \\int_{r_c}^{r_{max}} C r^{-p} \\, dr$$\nAssuming $p \\ne 1$, the integral evaluates to:\n$$N_s = C \\left[ \\frac{r^{1-p}}{1-p} \\right]_{r_c}^{r_{max}} = \\frac{C}{1-p} \\left( r_{max}^{1-p} - r_c^{1-p} \\right)$$\nFor physically realistic surfaces, it is common to find that the exponent $p > 1$. In this case, the expression is better written as:\n$$N_s = \\frac{C}{p-1} \\left( r_c^{1-p} - r_{max}^{1-p} \\right)$$\nFor typical nucleate boiling conditions, the critical radius $r_c$ is much smaller than the maximum cavity radius $r_{max}$. Since $p>1$, the exponent $(1-p)$ is negative, which means the term $r_c^{1-p}$ is much larger than $r_{max}^{1-p}$. Therefore, it is a valid approximation to neglect the $r_{max}$ term to find the dominant scaling behavior:\n$$N_s \\approx \\frac{C}{p-1} r_c^{1-p}$$\nNow, we substitute the dependence of $r_c$ on $\\Delta T$:\n$$N_s \\propto (r_c)^{1-p} \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Delta T} \\right)^{1-p} = (\\Delta T)^{p-1}$$\nThus, the nucleation site density $N_s$ scales with the wall superheat $\\Delta T$ as a power law, $N_s \\propto (\\Delta T)^{m}$. The problem statement asks for the exponent $m$ in the dependence $N_s \\propto (\\Delta T)^m$. By comparing the two forms, we identify the exponent:\n$$m = p-1$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe problem provides an empirical correlation for $N_s$ on a polished copper surface, which follows the derived power-law form:\n$$N_s = K (\\Delta T)^m$$\nThe given parameters are:\n- $K = 1.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}K^{-m}}$\n- $m = 1.8$\n- $\\Delta T = 12\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the equation to calculate the nucleation site density $N_s$:\n$$N_s = (1.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (12)^{1.8}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the term $(12)^{1.8}$:\n$$(12)^{1.8} \\approx 87.57351$$\nNow, we multiply this by the constant $K$:\n$$N_s = (1.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\times 87.57351 = 87573.51$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in units of $\\mathrm{m^{-2}}$ and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$N_s \\approx 87600 \\, \\mathrm{m^{-2}}$$\nExpressing this in scientific notation gives:\n$$N_s = 8.76 \\times 10^4 \\, \\mathrm{m^{-2}}$$\nThe units are consistent, as $K$ is in units of $\\mathrm{m^{-2}K^{-m}}$ and $(\\Delta T)^m$ is in units of $\\mathrm{K^m}$, their product is in units of $\\mathrm{m^{-2}}$.",

The Rohsenow correlation accounts for surface effects through the empirical parameter $C_{sf}$.

The value of $C_{sf}=0.013$ is given for a \"polished copper\" surface, but this description is qualitative. Different polishing techniques can result in different surface finishes and, consequently, different values of $C_{sf}$. The heat flux prediction is extremely sensitive to this parameter, as $q'' \\propto (1/C_{sf})^3$. A mere $10\\%$ decrease in $C_{sf}$ (e.g., to $0.0117$) would increase the predicted heat flux by approximately $37\\%$, while a $10\\%$ increase would decrease the heat flux by about $25\\%$. Given that literature values for $C_{sf}$ for copper-water systems can vary more widely depending on surface preparation, the uncertainty in the estimated heat flux is significant. This highlights a primary limitation of such correlations and underscores the importance of direct surface characterization for more accurate, mechanistic modeling of boiling.\n\nRounding the calculated heat flux to three significant figures, we get $0.477\\,\\mathrm{MW/m^2}$.",
