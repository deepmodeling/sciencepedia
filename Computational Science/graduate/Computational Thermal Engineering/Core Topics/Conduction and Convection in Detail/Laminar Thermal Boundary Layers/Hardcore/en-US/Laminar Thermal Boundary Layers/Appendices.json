It invokes the conservation of energy, Reynolds decomposition, and boundary-layer theory, all of which are standard, well-established concepts in thermal engineering.

I will proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Conditions\n\nThe problem asks for a set of sufficient criteria for three conditions to be met in the context of flow over a flat plate. We will analyze each condition.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\n\nThe analysis begins with the conservation of energy for an incompressible, constant-property Newtonian fluid in two dimensions, with negligible viscous dissipation and no internal generation. After applying the Reynolds decomposition for velocity ($u = \\overline{u} + u'$, $v = \\overline{v} + v'$) and temperature ($T = \\overline{T} + T'$) and time-averaging, the steady-state energy equation becomes:\n$$ \\overline{u} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{T}}{\\partial x} + \\overline{v} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{T}}{\\partial y} = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 \\overline{T}}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\overline{T}}{\\partial y^2} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u'T'}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\overline{v'T'}}{\\partial y} \\right) $$\nThe terms $-\\rho c_p \\overline{u'T'}$ and $-\\rho c_p \\overline{v'T'}$ represent the turbulent heat fluxes in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. We now evaluate the three required conditions.\n\n**(i) The hydrodynamic boundary layer remains laminar:**\nThe transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the boundary layer over a smooth flat plate is known to occur when the local Reynolds number, $Re_{x} = U_{\\infty} x / \\nu$, exceeds a critical value, $Re_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$. For the flow to be laminar, the Reynolds number must be below this critical value.\n$$ Re_{x}  Re_{x,\\mathrm{cr}} $$\nThe typical value for $Re_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$ is approximately $5 \\times 10^5$.\n\n**(ii) Turbulent heat fluxes are absent:**\nTurbulent heat fluxes arise from the correlation between velocity fluctuations ($u'$, $v'$) and temperature fluctuations ($T'$). In a laminar flow, by definition, there are no turbulent fluctuations. Thus, $u' = 0$, $v' = 0$, and $T' = 0$ everywhere and at all times. This directly implies that the time-averaged correlation terms are zero:\n$$ \\overline{u'T'} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\overline{v'T'} = 0 $$\nTherefore, the condition for laminar flow, $Re_{x}  Re_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$, is a sufficient condition for the absence of turbulent heat fluxes.\n\n**(iii) The energy equation is validly treated as parabolic:**\nWith the conditions for laminar flow met, the turbulent flux terms in the energy equation are zero. The steady, laminar, $2$D energy equation is:\n$$ u \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} $$\n(Here, $u$, $v$, and $T$ represent the mean quantities).\nFor this partial differential equation to be treated as parabolic in the streamwise coordinate $x$, the highest order derivative with respect to $x$, which is the axial diffusion term $\\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}$, must be negligible compared to the other dominant terms.\n\nTo compare the magnitudes, we use boundary-layer scaling. Let $x$ be the characteristic length in the streamwise direction, and $\\delta_t$ be the thermal boundary layer thickness.\nThe scales of the variables are: $u \\sim U_{\\infty}$, $x \\sim x$, $y \\sim \\delta_t$, and $T \\sim \\Delta T = |T_w - T_{\\infty}|$.\nFrom the continuity equation, $v \\sim U_{\\infty} (\\delta_t / x)$.\n\nThe magnitudes of the terms in the energy equation are:\n- Streamwise Advection: $u \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\sim U_{\\infty} \\frac{\\Delta T}{x}$\n- Transverse Diffusion: $\\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\sim \\alpha \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta_t^2}$\n- Axial Diffusion: $\\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\sim \\alpha \\frac{\\Delta T}{x^2}$\n\nIn boundary layer theory, the transport process is a balance between streamwise advection and transverse diffusion. Therefore, these two terms must be of the same order of magnitude.\nThe underlying boundary-layer approximation itself, where we assume a thin layer of viscous and thermal effects, is valid only for high Reynolds numbers, i.e., $Re_{x} \\gg 1$.\n\nFor the parabolic assumption to be valid, axial diffusion must be negligible compared to streamwise advection:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{Axial Diffusion}}{\\text{Streamwise Advection}} = \\frac{\\alpha (\\Delta T / x^2)}{U_{\\infty} (\\Delta T / x)} = \\frac{\\alpha}{U_{\\infty} x} = \\frac{1}{Pe_{x}} $$\nThus, we require the ratio to be much less than $1$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{Pe_{x}} \\ll 1 \\implies Pe_{x} \\gg 1 $$\n\n**Summary of Sufficient Criteria:**\n1.  For the boundary-layer model itself to be valid, we need $Re_{x} \\gg 1$.\n2.  For the boundary layer to be laminar (i), and consequently for turbulent fluxes to be absent (ii), we need $Re_{x}  Re_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$.\n3.  For the energy equation to be parabolic in $x$ (iii), we need $Pe_{x} \\gg 1$.\n\nCombining these, a sufficient set of criteria is: $1 \\ll Re_{x}  Re_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$, $Pe_{x} \\gg 1$, and the explicit statement for requirement (ii), $\\overline{u'T'} = 0$ and $\\overline{v'T'} = 0$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $1 \\ll Re_{x}  Re_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$, $Pe_{x} \\gg 1$, and $\\overline{u^{\\prime} T^{\\prime}} = 0$, $\\overline{v^{\\prime} T^{\\prime}} = 0$.**\n- $1 \\ll Re_{x}  Re_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$: This ensures that the boundary-layer approximations are valid ($Re_x \\gg 1$) and that the flow is laminar (criterion i).\n- $\\overline{u^{\\prime} T^{\\prime}} = 0$, $\\overline{v^{\\prime} T^{\\prime}} = 0$: This explicitly states that turbulent heat fluxes are absent (criterion ii), which is a direct consequence of the laminar flow condition.\n- $Pe_{x} \\gg 1$: This ensures that axial diffusion is negligible, making the energy equation parabolic in the $x$ direction (criterion iii).\nThis set of conditions correctly and sufficiently addresses all three requirements of the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $Re_{x} \\ll 1$, $Pe_{x} \\ll 1$, and $\\overline{u^{\\prime} T^{\\prime}} = 0$, $\\overline{v^{\\prime} T^{\\prime}} = 0$.**\n- $Re_{x} \\ll 1$: This describes a creeping flow (Stokes flow) regime, not a boundary-layer flow. The scaling arguments used to simplify the equations are invalid in this regime. While the flow is laminar, the boundary layer concept does not apply.\n- $Pe_{x} \\ll 1$: This implies that axial diffusion is *dominant* over advection ($\\frac{1}{Pe_{x}} \\gg 1$). The energy equation would be fully elliptic, not parabolic.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $Re_{x}  Re_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$ only; no condition on $Pe_{x}$ or fluctuation correlations is needed.**\n- $Re_{x}  Re_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$ ensures laminar flow and thus satisfies criteria (i) and (ii). However, it does not guarantee criterion (iii). Since $Pe_{x} = Re_{x} Pr$, if the Prandtl number $Pr$ is very small (e.g., for liquid metals where $Pr \\ll 1$), it is possible to have a laminar $Re_x$ but a small $Pe_x$. For example, if $Pr = 0.01$ and $Re_x = 10^4$, then $Pe_x = 100$. But if $Re_x = 10^3$, $Pe_x=10$, which may not be large enough to neglect axial diffusion. A separate condition $Pe_x \\gg 1$ is required to ensure the parabolic nature of the energy equation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $Pe_{x} \\gg 1$ and $\\overline{u^{\\prime} T^{\\prime}} = 0$; no condition on $Re_{x}$ or $\\overline{v^{\\prime} T^{\\prime}}$ is needed.**\n- This option is incomplete and potentially inconsistent. It omits any condition on $Re_x$, which is necessary to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. The condition $\\overline{u^{\\prime} T^{\\prime}} = 0$ implies laminar flow (or a very special turbulent case), which in turn requires $Re_x  Re_{x,cr}$, but this is not stated. Furthermore, it omits the condition on the transverse turbulent heat flux, $\\overline{v'T'}$, which is the dominant turbulent flux term in boundary layers.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $Re_{x} \\gg Re_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$ but $\\overline{u^{\\prime} T^{\\prime}} = 0$, $\\overline{v^{\\prime} T^{\\prime}} = 0$.**\n- This option presents a direct physical contradiction. $Re_{x} \\gg Re_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$ states that the flow is well into the turbulent regime. In a turbulent flow with a mean temperature gradient, there will be temperature fluctuations ($T'$) that are correlated with the velocity fluctuations ($u'$, $v'$), leading to non-zero turbulent heat fluxes ($\\overline{u^{\\prime} T^{\\prime}} \\neq 0$, $\\overline{v^{\\prime} T^{\\prime}} \\neq 0$). Thus, the two conditions are mutually exclusive.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of heat transfer and numerical analysis, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided to derive the required relationship.\n\nThe task is to derive the resolution requirement for the first grid cell height, $\\Delta y_1$, to ensure the relative error in the computed wall heat flux is below a tolerance $\\varepsilon$. The wall heat flux is proportional to the temperature gradient at the wall, $q''(x) = -k\\,\\partial T/\\partial y|_{y=0}$. Therefore, constraining the relative error of $-\\partial T/\\partial y|_{y=0}$ is equivalent to constraining the relative error of $q''(x)$.\n\nLet the exact wall-normal temperature gradient be $T'(0) \\equiv \\left.\\partial T/\\partial y\\right|_{y=0}$. The numerical approximation is given by the three-point, one-sided finite-difference formula:\n$$\nT'(0) \\approx c_0\\,T(0) + c_1\\,T(y_1) + c_2\\,T(y_2)\n$$\nThe grid points are at $y=0$, $y_1 = \\Delta y_1$, and $y_2 = \\Delta y_1(1+r)$. The coefficients $c_0$, $c_1$, and $c_2$ are determined by requiring the formula to be exact for polynomials of degree up to $2$ (i.e., for $T(y) = 1$, $T(y) = y$, and $T(y) = y^2$). This is achieved by expanding $T(y_1)$ and $T(y_2)$ in a Taylor series around $y=0$:\n$$\nT(y_1) = T(0) + y_1 T'(0) + \\frac{y_1^2}{2} T''(0) + \\frac{y_1^3}{6} T^{(3)}(0) + O(y_1^4)\n$$\n$$\nT(y_2) = T(0) + y_2 T'(0) + \\frac{y_2^2}{2} T''(0) + \\frac{y_2^3}{6} T^{(3)}(0) + O(y_2^4)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the finite-difference formula and matching terms with $T'(0)$ yields a system of equations for the coefficients:\n1.
