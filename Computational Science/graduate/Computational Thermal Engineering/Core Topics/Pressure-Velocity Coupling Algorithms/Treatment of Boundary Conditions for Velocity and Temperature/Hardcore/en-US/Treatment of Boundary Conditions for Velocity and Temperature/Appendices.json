The left and right external surfaces at $x=0$ and $x=L_A+L_B$ are exposed to fluids at the same ambient temperature $T_{\\infty}$; the heat transfer coefficients are $h_L$ at $x=0$ and $h_R$ at $x=L_A+L_B$. The external flows are steady, laminar, and fully developed, and the no-slip velocity boundary condition at each solid–fluid interface holds.

I will proceed to provide a complete solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the temperature distributions in a two-layer composite wall and the fraction of internally generated heat that escapes through the left surface. The analysis is based on the principles of steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction.\n\n**1. Formulation of the Boundary Value Problem**\n\nThe governing equation for steady, one-dimensional heat conduction with constant thermal conductivity $k$ and volumetric heat generation $\\dot{q}$ is derived from the conservation of energy:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 T}{dx^2} + \\frac{\\dot{q}}{k} = 0 $$\nApplying this to each layer, we get two governing equations:\nFor Layer A ($0 \\le x \\le L_A$):\n$$ \\frac{d^2 T_A}{dx^2} + \\frac{\\dot{q}}{k_A} = 0 $$\nFor Layer B ($L_A \\le x \\le L_A + L_B$):\n$$ \\frac{d^2 T_B}{dx^2} = 0 $$\n\nThe boundary and interface conditions are as follows:\n1.  Convection at the left surface ($x=0$): The heat conducted to the surface from within equals the heat convected away to the fluid. Fourier's law on the left, Newton's law of cooling on the right.\n    $$ -k_A \\frac{dT_A}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = h_L [T_A(0) - T_{\\infty}] $$\n2.  Continuity of temperature at the interface ($x=L_A$): Due to perfect thermal contact.\n    $$ T_A(L_A) = T_B(L_A) $$\n3.  Continuity of heat flux at the interface ($x=L_A$): The heat flux leaving layer A must equal the heat flux entering layer B.\n    $$ -k_A \\frac{dT_A}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L_A} = -k_B \\frac{dT_B}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L_A} $$\n4.  Convection at the right surface ($x=L_A+L_B$):\n    $$ -k_B \\frac{dT_B}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L_A+L_B} = h_R [T_B(L_A+L_B) - T_{\\infty}] $$\n\n**2. Solving for the Temperature Fields and Heat Flux Fraction**\n\nInstead of solving the full system of four algebraic equations for the integration constants, we can use a more physically insightful approach by defining the heat fluxes at the boundaries. Let $q'_L$ be the heat flux leaving the wall through the left surface at $x=0$, and $q'_R$ be the heat flux leaving through the right surface at $x=L_A+L_B$. The heat flux is defined as $q'_x = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}$. The flux leaving the left face is in the $-x$ direction, so $q'_L = -q'_x(0) = k_A \\frac{dT_A}{dx}|_{x=0}$. The flux leaving the right face is in the $+x$ direction, so $q'_R = q'_x(L_A+L_B) = -k_B \\frac{dT_B}{dx}|_{L_A+L_B}$.\n\nAn overall energy balance on the entire composite wall dictates that the total heat generated per unit area, $\\dot{Q}'_{gen} = \\dot{q}L_A$, must equal the sum of the heat fluxes leaving the two surfaces:\n$$ \\dot{q} L_A = q'_L + q'_R $$\nThe problem asks for the fraction $f_L = q'_L / (\\dot{q}L_A)$.\n\nLet's integrate the heat equation for layer A starting from the unknown flux $q'_x(x)$. The energy balance for a control volume in A from $0$ to $x$ is $q'_x(x) - q'_x(0) + \\int_0^x \\dot{q} d\\xi = 0$. With $q'_x(0) = -q'_L$, this yields:\n$$ q'_x(x) = -q'_L - \\dot{q}x $$\nSubstituting Fourier's law, $-k_A \\frac{dT_A}{dx}$, for $q'_x(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{dT_A}{dx} = \\frac{1}{k_A}(q'_L + \\dot{q}x) $$\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ from $0$ to $x$:\n$$ T_A(x) - T_A(0) = \\int_0^x \\frac{1}{k_A}(q'_L + \\dot{q}\\xi) d\\xi = \\frac{q'_L x}{k_A} + \\frac{\\dot{q}x^2}{2k_A} $$\nFrom the convective boundary condition at $x=0$, we have $q'_L = h_L[T_A(0) - T_{\\infty}]$, which gives $T_A(0) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q'_L}{h_L}$.\nSubstituting $T_A(0)$ gives the temperature profile in layer A in terms of the unknown flux $q'_L$:\n$$ T_A(x) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q'_L}{h_L} + \\frac{q'_L x}{k_A} + \\frac{\\dot{q}x^2}{2k_A} = T_{\\infty} + q'_L \\left( \\frac{1}{h_L} + \\frac{x}{k_A} \\right) + \\frac{\\dot{q}x^2}{2k_A} $$\nAt the interface $x=L_A$, the temperature is:\n$$ T_A(L_A) = T_{\\infty} + q'_L \\left( \\frac{1}{h_L} + \\frac{L_A}{k_A} \\right) + \\frac{\\dot{q}L_A^2}{2k_A} $$\n\nFor layer B, there is no heat generation, so the heat flux is constant. This flux is equal to the heat leaving the right surface, $q'_R$. From the overall energy balance, $q'_R = \\dot{q}L_A - q'_L$. The temperature difference across layer B and the convective boundary layer at the right surface can be expressed using thermal resistances:\nThe total temperature drop from the interface at $x=L_A$ to the ambient fluid on the right is the sum of the drops across layer B and the convective film:\n$$ T_B(L_A) - T_{\\infty} = (T_B(L_A) - T_B(L_A+L_B)) + (T_B(L_A+L_B) - T_{\\infty}) $$\nUsing resistances, this is:\n$$ T_B(L_A) - T_{\\infty} = q'_R \\left( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} \\right) + q'_R \\left( \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right) = q'_R \\left( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right) $$\nSubstituting $q'_R = \\dot{q}L_A - q'_L$:\n$$ T_B(L_A) - T_{\\infty} = (\\dot{q}L_A - q'_L) \\left( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right) $$\n\nNow, invoking the temperature continuity condition at the interface, $T_A(L_A) = T_B(L_A)$, we can equate the expressions for the temperature rise above ambient, $T(L_A) - T_\\infty$:\n$$ q'_L \\left( \\frac{1}{h_L} + \\frac{L_A}{k_A} \\right) + \\frac{\\dot{q}L_A^2}{2k_A} = (\\dot{q}L_A - q'_L) \\left( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right) $$\nWe can now solve for the unknown heat flux $q'_L$. Expanding the right side gives:\n$$ q'_L \\left( \\frac{1}{h_L} + \\frac{L_A}{k_A} \\right) + \\frac{\\dot{q}L_A^2}{2k_A} = \\dot{q}L_A \\left( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right) - q'_L \\left( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right) $$\nCollecting terms involving $q'_L$ on the left side:\n$$ q'_L \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{h_L} + \\frac{L_A}{k_A} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right) \\right] = \\dot{q}L_A \\left( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right) - \\frac{\\dot{q}L_A^2}{2k_A} $$\nWait, I made a sign error in the derivation of $T_A(x)$. Let's re-check the integration of the heat flux.\n$q'_x(x) = -k_A \\frac{dT_A}{dx}$. $\\frac{d q'_x}{dx} + \\dot{q} = 0$.\n$\\int_{q'_x(0)}^{q'_x(x)} d q'_x = \\int_0^x -\\dot{q} d\\xi$.\n$q'_x(x) - q'_x(0) = -\\dot{q}x$. With $q'_x(0)=-q'_L$, we get $q'_x(x) = -q'_L -\\dot{q}x$.\nSo $-k_A \\frac{dT_A}{dx} = -q'_L - \\dot{q}x$, which means $\\frac{dT_A}{dx} = \\frac{q'_L + \\dot{q}x}{k_A}$, same as before.\nWait, my initial governing equation was $\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} + \\frac{\\dot{q}}{k} = 0$. Integrating once: $\\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k}x + C_1$. At $x=0$, $\\frac{dT_A}{dx}|_0 = C_1$. The heat flux leaving is $q'_L = k_A \\frac{dT_A}{dx}|_0 = k_A C_1$. So $C_1=q'_L/k_A$.\n$\\frac{dT_A}{dx} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k_A} x + \\frac{q'_L}{k_A}$.\nIntegrating again: $T_A(x) - T_A(0) = \\int_0^x (-\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k_A}\\xi + \\frac{q'_L}{k_A})d\\xi = -\\frac{\\dot{q}x^2}{2k_A} + \\frac{q'_L x}{k_A}$.\nWith $T_A(0) = T_\\infty + q'_L/h_L$, this gives:\n$$ T_A(x) = T_\\infty + \\frac{q'_L}{h_L} + \\frac{q'_L x}{k_A} - \\frac{\\dot{q}x^2}{2k_A} = T_\\infty + q'_L \\left( \\frac{1}{h_L} + \\frac{x}{k_A} \\right) - \\frac{\\dot{q}x^2}{2k_A} $$\nOkay, this derivation is correct. My previous one had a sign error. So at $x=L_A$:\n$$ T_A(L_A) - T_\\infty = q'_L \\left( \\frac{1}{h_L} + \\frac{L_A}{k_A} \\right) - \\frac{\\dot{q}L_A^2}{2k_A} $$\nEquating this with $T_B(L_A)-T_\\infty = (\\dot{q}L_A - q'_L) ( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} )$:\n$$ q'_L \\left( \\frac{1}{h_L} + \\frac{L_A}{k_A} \\right) - \\frac{\\dot{q}L_A^2}{2k_A} = \\dot{q}L_A \\left( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right) - q'_L \\left( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right) $$\nCollecting terms again:\n$$ q'_L \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{h_L} + \\frac{L_A}{k_A} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right) \\right] = \\dot{q}L_A \\left( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right) + \\frac{\\dot{q}L_A^2}{2k_A} $$\nThe fraction $f_L = q'_L / (\\dot{q}L_A)$ is obtained by dividing the entire equation by $\\dot{q}L_A$:\n$$ f_L \\left[ \\frac{1}{h_L} + \\frac{L_A}{k_A} + \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right] = \\left( \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R} \\right) + \\frac{L_A}{2k_A} $$\nFinally, solving for $f_L$ yields the dimensionless expression:\n$$ f_L = \\frac{\\frac{L_A}{2k_A} + \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_R}}{\\frac{L_A}{k_A} + \\frac{L_B}{k_B} + \\frac{1}{h_L} + \\frac{1}{h_R}} $$\nThis result is physically intuitive. It represents the ratio of the thermal resistance on the right side of the \"effective center\" of heat generation (at $x=L_A/2$) to the total series thermal resistance of the entire system.\n\nHaving found $q'_L = f_L \\dot{q}L_A$, the temperature profiles are fully determined.\nFor layer A ($0 \\le x \\le L_A$):\n$$ T_A(x) = T_{\\infty} + (f_L \\dot{q}L_A) \\left( \\frac{1}{h_L} + \\frac{x}{k_A} \\right) - \\frac{\\dot{q}x^2}{2k_A} $$\nFor layer B ($L_A \\le x \\le L_A + L_B$), the flux is $q'_R = (1-f_L)\\dot{q}L_A$. The temperature at any point $x$ in B is:\n$$ T_B(x) = T_{\\infty} + q'_R \\left( \\frac{1}{h_R} + \\frac{L_A+L_B - x}{k_B} \\right) = T_\\infty + (1-f_L)\\dot{q}L_A \\left( \\frac{1}{h_R} + \\frac{L_A+L_B - x}{k_B} \\right) $$\nThese expressions, with $f_L$ substituted, represent the solution to the boundary value problem. The primary request is the closed-form expression for $f_L$.",

            "problem": "Consider incompressible, turbulent air flow over a heated wall subject to an adverse pressure gradient that causes separation from $x=L_s$ to $x=L_r$. The flow is computed with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) model using a high-Reynolds-number two-equation turbulence closure with standard wall functions for both velocity and temperature. In the separated region, the computed wall shear stress and wall heat flux are found to be severely mispredicted. You are asked to analyze, from first principles, why wall functions become unreliable in separated flows and to propose physically consistent low-Reynolds-number corrections that allow a transition to resolved boundary layers for both velocity and temperature. Your proposals must be consistent with the governing conservation equations, the physics of near-wall turbulence in the viscous sublayer, and the mathematical requirements for boundary condition treatment.\n\nAssume the following near-inlet conditions upstream of separation are representative for estimating near-wall resolution requirements: air properties $\\rho=1.20\\,\\text{kg/m}^3$ and $\\mu=1.80\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$, free-stream velocity $U_\\infty=20\\,\\text{m/s}$, and a local turbulent skin-friction coefficient $C_f=0.003$. For a transition from wall-function modeling to a fully resolved low-Reynolds-number approach, you should base your reasoning on the Reynolds-averaged momentum and energy equations, the definition of friction velocity and viscous length scale, and the requirement that the turbulent viscosity and turbulent thermal diffusivity vanish at the wall in the limit $y\\to 0$. When specifying thermal boundary conditions, ensure that the statement is consistent with either an imposed wall temperature or an imposed wall heat flux.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct?\n\nA. Standard wall functions for velocity and temperature rely on an equilibrium turbulent boundary-layer assumption with a monotonic mean velocity gradient and a quasi-universal logarithmic layer. In separated flows under strong adverse pressure gradients, the near-wall mean shear can vanish or reverse, invalidating the wall-function assumptions. A physically consistent transition to resolved boundary layers requires enforcing the no-slip velocity boundary condition at the wall, resolving the viscous sublayer with a first cell satisfying $y^+\\approx 1$, and computing heat transfer by integrating the energy equation to the wall without temperature wall functions, so that molecular diffusion dominates as $y\\to 0$.\n\nB.

A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the limitations of standard wall functions. These functions are based on the Law of the Wall, which describes a universal velocity profile for steady, incompressible, turbulent boundary layers on smooth, flat plates with zero pressure gradient. The key assumptions are:\n1.  **Local Equilibrium**: The rate of turbulence production is equal to the rate of its dissipation.\n2.  **Constant Shear Stress Layer**: The total shear stress is approximately constant and equal to the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$.\n3.  **Logarithmic Velocity Profile**: In the region $y^+  30$, the velocity profile is given by $u^+ = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln(y^+) + B$, where $u^+ = u/u_\\tau$, $y^+ = yu_\\tau/\\nu$, and $u_\\tau = \\sqrt{\\tau_w/\\rho}$.\nA similar logarithmic law is assumed for temperature based on the Reynolds analogy.\n\nIn a flow with a strong adverse pressure gradient that leads to separation, these assumptions are violated:\n- The flow is not in local equilibrium; advection and diffusion of turbulent quantities are significant.\n- The pressure gradient term is no longer negligible in the near-wall momentum balance.\n- The velocity profile deviates significantly from the logarithmic law.\n- At the separation point, $\\tau_w \\to 0$, which makes the friction velocity $u_\\tau$ and thus the scaling variables $u^+$ and $y^+$ ill-defined. In the recirculation zone, $\\tau_w  0$, making $u_\\tau$ imaginary, and the log-law is undefined.\n\nTherefore, wall functions, which use the log-law to bridge a coarse near-wall grid to the wall, cannot correctly compute $\\tau_w$ and the wall heat flux $q_w$. A physically consistent approach must abandon wall functions and resolve the flow all the way to the wall. This is known as a low-Reynolds-number modeling approach. It requires:\n1.  A turbulence model that is valid in the viscous-dominated near-wall region. This involves damping functions to ensure the turbulent viscosity $\\nu_t \\to 0$ as the wall distance $y \\to 0$.\n2.  A computational grid fine enough to resolve the viscous sublayer, typically requiring the first grid point to be at $y^+ \\le 1$.\n3.  Direct application of physical boundary conditions at the wall:\n    - **Velocity**: No-slip condition ($u=v=w=0$).\n    - **Temperature**: Dirichlet condition, $T=T_w$ (for imposed temperature), or Neumann condition, $-k_{fluid} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n} = q_w$ (for imposed heat flux), where $k_{fluid}$ is the molecular thermal conductivity of the fluid.\n\nWe now evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Standard wall functions for velocity and temperature rely on an equilibrium turbulent boundary-layer assumption with a monotonic mean velocity gradient and a quasi-universal logarithmic layer. In separated flows under strong adverse pressure gradients, the near-wall mean shear can vanish or reverse, invalidating the wall-function assumptions. A physically consistent transition to resolved boundary layers requires enforcing the no-slip velocity boundary condition at the wall, resolving the viscous sublayer with a first cell satisfying $y^+\\approx 1$, and computing heat transfer by integrating the energy equation to the wall without temperature wall functions, so that molecular diffusion dominates as $y\\to 0$.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes the theoretical basis of wall functions and the reason for their failure in separated flows. The proposed remedy—a low-Reynolds-number approach—is correctly detailed with its key requirements: enforcing the no-slip condition, resolving the viscous sublayer ($y^+\\approx 1$), and integrating the energy equation to the wall, where molecular transport mechanisms (viscous stress and heat conduction) become dominant. The statement is entirely consistent with the first principles of fluid dynamics and heat transfer.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. In separated regions, the heat transfer deficiency caused by wall functions can be corrected by keeping the high-Reynolds-number model and wall functions unchanged and increasing the constant turbulent Prandtl number to $Pr_t=1.0$; no grid refinement or low-Reynolds-number corrections are necessary.**\n\nThis proposal is fundamentally flawed. The turbulent Prandtl number, $Pr_t = \\nu_t/\\alpha_t$, relates the eddy diffusivity for momentum ($\\nu_t$) to that for heat ($\\alpha_t$). The primary error of the wall function in a separated flow is the incorrect prediction of the near-wall velocity field and, consequently, an incorrect $\\nu_t$. Simply changing the value of $Pr_t$ cannot rectify this fundamental error in the momentum solution. The problem lies with the wall-function model itself, which is invalid in this flow regime. A proper solution necessitates abandoning the wall function approach in favor of a low-Reynolds-number model with appropriate grid resolution, as described previously.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. A robust low-Reynolds-number treatment for separated flows with heat transfer can be obtained by adopting a blended two-equation model such as the Shear Stress Transport (SST) $k$–$\\omega$ with a near-wall blending function, enforcing $\\nu_t\\to 0$ as $y\\to 0$, placing the first grid point at $y^+\\le 1$, limiting near-wall turbulence production in regions of vanishing or reversed shear through viscous damping, and applying a consistent Neumann boundary condition for the energy equation when a wall heat flux is imposed.**\n\nThis statement describes a state-of-the-art approach for handling such flows. The SST $k-\\omega$ model is specifically designed to perform well in adverse pressure gradients and separated flows. It achieves this by blending the $k-\\omega$ model (robust and accurate near walls) with the $k-\\epsilon$ model (robust in the free stream). It is a low-Reynolds-number formulation, meaning it integrates through the viscous sublayer to the wall. This requires that the turbulent viscosity $\\nu_t$ correctly approaches zero at the wall and that the grid is sufficiently fine ($y^+\\le 1$). The model also includes a production limiter to prevent over-prediction of turbulence in stagnation regions. Finally, applying the Neumann boundary condition for temperature, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n} = -\\frac{q_w}{k_{fluid}}$, is the correct way to specify a given wall heat flux $q_w$ in a wall-resolved simulation. The statement is a precise and accurate description of a valid and robust modeling strategy.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. To avoid numerical stiffness in low-Reynolds-number computations, it is acceptable to retain a slip velocity boundary condition at the wall and extrapolate wall shear stress from the first off-wall cell; this approach is equivalent to resolving the viscous sublayer and therefore suitable for separated flows.**\n\nThis statement is physically and numerically incorrect. The no-slip condition is a fundamental principle for viscous continuum flows at a solid boundary. Replacing it with a slip condition is a violation of the governing physics. While low-Reynolds-number models can introduce numerical stiffness due to the disparate scales, the solution is to use robust numerical methods (e.g., implicit solvers, appropriate under-relaxation), not to discard fundamental physics. Extrapolating shear stress is precisely what wall functions attempt to do, but this statement suggests an ad-hoc extrapolation without a valid physical model, which is even worse. This approach is the antithesis of \"resolving the viscous sublayer\" and would not be suitable for any viscous flow, let alone a complex separated one.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Using the provided properties and $C_f$ upstream of separation, the first cell height required to achieve $y^+=1$ is approximately $\\Delta y\\approx 2.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}$, which is appropriate for transitioning to a resolved low-Reynolds-number boundary-layer treatment.**\n\nThis statement requires a quantitative check. The upstream conditions provide a good estimate for the required mesh resolution.\n1.  Calculate the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$:\n    $$ \\tau_w = C_f \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\rho U_\\infty^2 = 0.003 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.20\\,\\text{kg/m}^3 \\times (20\\,\\text{m/s})^2 $$\n    $$ \\tau_w = 0.003 \\times 0.5 \\times 1.20 \\times 400 = 0.72\\,\\text{Pa} $$\n2.  Calculate the friction velocity, $u_\\tau$:\n    $$ u_\\tau = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau_w}{\\rho}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.72\\,\\text{Pa}}{1.20\\,\\text{kg/m}^3}} = \\sqrt{0.6}\\,\\text{m/s} \\approx 0.7746\\,\\text{m/s} $$\n3.  Calculate the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$:\n    $$ \\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho} = \\frac{1.80\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}}{1.20\\,\\text{kg/m}^3} = 1.50\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s} $$\n4.  Calculate the wall distance $y$ corresponding to $y^+=1$:\n    $$ y = \\frac{y^+ \\nu}{u_\\tau} = \\frac{1 \\times 1.50\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}}{0.7746\\,\\text{m/s}} \\approx 1.936 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m} $$\nThe calculated value of $y \\approx 1.94 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}$ is indeed approximately $2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}$. Placing the first grid point at this distance (or less) from the wall to achieve $y^+ \\le 1$ is the standard practice for wall-resolved, low-Reynolds-number simulations. Thus, the calculation is correct and the conclusion is sound.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**",
