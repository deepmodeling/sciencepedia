This is the Brinkman–Forchheimer extended Darcy (BFE) equation. For a flow driven by a macroscopic pressure gradient, this vector equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho}{\\phi^2} (\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\boldsymbol{u} = -\\nabla p + \\mu_e \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} - \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa} \\boldsymbol{u} - \\frac{\\rho c_F}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}|\\boldsymbol{u}|\\boldsymbol{u}\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{u}$ is the superficial (or Darcy) velocity, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\phi$ is the porosity, $p$ is the macroscopic pressure, $\\mu_e$ is the effective viscosity, $\\mu$ is the fluid viscosity, $\\kappa$ is the permeability, and $c_F$ is the Forchheimer form-drag coefficient.\n\nThe problem specifies a fully developed, unidirectional flow field $\\boldsymbol{u}(x,y,z) = u(y)\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_x$ between two parallel plates at $y = \\pm H$.

Since $\\alpha  0$ and $H0$, $\\sinh(\\alpha H) \\neq 0$, which implies $C_2 = 0$. This confirms the expectation that the velocity profile must be an even function of $y$ due to the symmetry of the problem.\nSubstituting $C_2=0$ into the first boundary condition equation gives:\n$C_1 \\cosh(\\alpha H) + \\frac{G\\kappa}{\\mu} = 0 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{G\\kappa/\\mu}{\\cosh(\\alpha H)}$.\n\nSubstituting the constants back into the general solution, we obtain the exact velocity profile:\n$$\nu(y) = \\frac{G\\kappa}{\\mu} - \\frac{G\\kappa/\\mu}{\\cosh(\\alpha H)} \\cosh(\\alpha y) = \\frac{G\\kappa}{\\mu} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\cosh(\\alpha y)}{\\cosh(\\alpha H)} \\right)\n$$\nNext, we calculate the volumetric flow rate per unit width, $Q'$, by integrating the velocity profile from $y=-H$ to $y=H$:\n$$\nQ' = \\int_{-H}^{H} u(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\int_{-H}^{H} \\frac{G\\kappa}{\\mu} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\cosh(\\alpha y)}{\\cosh(\\alpha H)} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}y\n$$\nSince the integrand is an even function, we can simplify the integral:\n$$\nQ' = 2 \\frac{G\\kappa}{\\mu} \\int_{0}^{H} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\cosh(\\alpha y)}{\\cosh(\\alpha H)} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}y\n$$\n$$\nQ' = 2 \\frac{G\\kappa}{\\mu} \\left[ y - \\frac{\\sinh(\\alpha y)}{\\alpha \\cosh(\\alpha H)} \\right]_{0}^{H} = 2 \\frac{G\\kappa}{\\mu} \\left( (H - \\frac{\\sinh(\\alpha H)}{\\alpha \\cosh(\\alpha H)}) - (0 - 0) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ' = 2 \\frac{G\\kappa}{\\mu} \\left( H - \\frac{\\tanh(\\alpha H)}{\\alpha} \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we non-dimensionalize the flow rate $Q'$ to obtain $\\Phi$.

            "solution": "We begin with the conservation of linear momentum for a steady, incompressible Newtonian fluid of dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ and density $\\rho$ moving through a rigid, homogeneous, isotropic porous medium. In the volume-averaged formulation suitable for porous media, the Brinkman–Forchheimer extended Darcy model augments Darcy’s linear drag with Brinkman’s viscous diffusion and Forchheimer’s quadratic inertial drag. The streamwise component of the volume-averaged momentum balance can be written as\n$$\n\\mathbf{0} = - \\nabla \\langle p \\rangle + \\mu_{\\text{eff}} \\nabla^{2} \\langle \\mathbf{u} \\rangle - \\frac{\\mu}{K}\\, \\langle \\mathbf{u} \\rangle - \\rho\\, \\beta\\, \\left\\lVert \\langle \\mathbf{u} \\rangle \\right\\rVert \\langle \\mathbf{u} \\rangle,\n$$\nwhere $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes an intrinsic or superficial average over a representative elementary volume, $K$ is the permeability in $\\text{m}^{2}$, and $\\beta$ is the inertial resistance coefficient in $\\text{m}^{-1}$. The term $\\mu_{\\text{eff}} \\nabla^{2} \\langle \\mathbf{u} \\rangle$ is the Brinkman viscous diffusion contribution, with $\\mu_{\\text{eff}}$ an effective viscosity. For steady, one-dimensional, fully developed flow in the $x$ direction with constant cross-section and negligible cross-sectional variation of the average streamwise velocity profile, the cross-sectionally averaged Laplacian of the average streamwise velocity vanishes over the averaging length in the $x$ direction. This is justified when the characteristic streamwise variation length scale is large compared to the pore-scale and the flow is fully developed such that entrance and wall-layer effects are confined to thin regions that do not contribute at the averaging scale. Under these conditions, the cross-sectionally averaged Brinkman term can be neglected in the streamwise balance.\n\nLet $U$ denote the cross-sectionally averaged superficial velocity in the $x$ direction and let $g = - \\mathrm{d}\\langle p \\rangle / \\mathrm{d}x$ denote the streamwise pressure gradient (positive when pressure drops in the direction of the flow). The one-dimensional, fully developed, cross-sectionally averaged streamwise momentum balance simplifies to the algebraic balance of drag forces against the pressure gradient:\n$$\ng = \\frac{\\mu}{K}\\, U + \\rho\\, \\beta\\, \\lvert U \\rvert\\, U.\n$$\nThis expression represents $g$ as a linear combination of two regressors constructed from $U$, namely $U$ and $\\lvert U \\rvert U$, with unknown coefficients that enter linearly. Define two regression coefficients\n$$\na \\equiv \\frac{\\mu}{K}, \\qquad b \\equiv \\rho\\, \\beta.\n$$\nThen the model becomes\n$$\ng = a\\, U + b\\, \\lvert U \\rvert\\, U,\n$$\nwhich is linear in the unknowns $a$ and $b$. Once $a$ and $b$ are estimated from data, the physical parameters are recovered by\n$$\n\\widehat{K} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\widehat{a}}, \\qquad \\widehat{\\beta} = \\frac{\\widehat{b}}{\\rho}.\n$$\n\nGiven $n$ measurements $\\{(U_{i}, g_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, construct the $n \\times 2$ design matrix\n$$\n\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nU_{1}  \\lvert U_{1} \\rvert U_{1} \\\\\nU_{2}  \\lvert U_{2} \\rvert U_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots \\\\\nU_{n}  \\lvert U_{n} \\rvert U_{n}\n\\end{bmatrix},\n$$\nand the observation vector\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\begin{bmatrix} g_{1} \\\\ g_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ g_{n} \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nThe ordinary least squares estimator $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = [\\widehat{a}, \\widehat{b}]^{\\top}$ minimizes the residual sum of squares and is given by\n$$\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = \\underset{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}}{\\arg\\min}\\ \\lVert \\mathbf{X}\\, \\boldsymbol{\\theta} - \\mathbf{y} \\rVert_{2}^{2} = \\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{y},\n$$\nprovided $\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{X}$ is invertible, or by the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse more generally. The model predictions are $\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\mathbf{X}\\, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$, where $\\widehat{y}_{i}$ is the predicted pressure gradient corresponding to $U_{i}$.\n\nTo quantify model fit, compute the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination $R^{2}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(g_{i} - \\widehat{g}_{i}\\right)^{2}}, \\qquad\nR^{2} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(g_{i} - \\widehat{g}_{i}\\right)^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(g_{i} - \\overline{g}\\right)^{2}},\n$$\nwhere $\\overline{g} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_{i}$. The RMSE carries units of $\\text{Pa}/\\text{m}$ and $R^{2}$ is unitless.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n- For each dataset, assemble $\\mathbf{X}$ with columns $U_{i}$ and $\\lvert U_{i} \\rvert U_{i}$, and $\\mathbf{y}$ from $g_{i}$.\n- Solve for $\\widehat{a}$ and $\\widehat{b}$ using ordinary least squares (for example, via a numerically stable least squares solver).\n- Recover $\\widehat{K} = \\mu / \\widehat{a}$ in $\\text{m}^{2}$ and $\\widehat{\\beta} = \\widehat{b} / \\rho$ in $\\text{m}^{-1}$.\n- Compute $\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}$, RMSE in $\\text{Pa}/\\text{m}$, and $R^{2}$.\n- Round each reported value to $6$ significant figures for output.\n\nApplication to the provided test suite:\n- All cases share $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$ and $\\rho = 1000\\ \\text{kg}/\\text{m}^{3}$.\n- The five datasets provide $\\{U_{i}\\}$ and $\\{g_{i}\\}$ with $U_{i}$ in $\\text{m}/\\text{s}$ and $g_{i}$ in $\\text{Pa}/\\text{m}$.\n- Assemble the design matrices and observation vectors, solve the least squares problems, and compute the requested metrics as described.\n\nFinal output specification:\n- Produce a single line containing a list of five inner lists ordered by the cases, where each inner list is $[\\widehat{K}, \\widehat{\\beta}, \\mathrm{RMSE}, R^{2}]$.\n- Units and rounding: $\\widehat{K}$ in $\\text{m}^{2}$, $\\widehat{\\beta}$ in $\\text{m}^{-1}$, $\\mathrm{RMSE}$ in $\\text{Pa}/\\text{m}$, $R^{2}$ unitless; each rounded to $6$ significant figures.\n- The output format must be exactly:\n\"[ [k1,beta1,rmse1,r21], [k2,beta2,rmse2,r22], [k3,beta3,rmse3,r23], [k4,beta4,rmse4,r24], [k5,beta5,rmse5,r25] ]\"\nwith no extra spaces beyond those shown being required, but commas separating entries and lists, and no additional text.",
