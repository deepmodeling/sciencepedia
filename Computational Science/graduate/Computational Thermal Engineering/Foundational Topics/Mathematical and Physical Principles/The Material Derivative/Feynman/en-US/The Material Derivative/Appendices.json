            "introduction": "Our first practice focuses on a core application of the material derivative: determining the true acceleration of a fluid particle from a given Eulerian velocity field. This exercise  requires you to apply the full definition of the material derivative to a vector quantity, carefully separating the local acceleration, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}$, from the convective acceleration, $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$. Mastering this calculation is fundamental for linking field descriptions of motion to the forces acting on fluid elements.",

            "problem": "A simplified two-dimensional model for the fluid flow inside an industrial mixing chamber is described by the Eulerian velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t)$. The chamber is designed to create a straining flow, but also contains a pulsating element that introduces a time-dependent component. The resulting velocity vector of a fluid particle at position $(x, y)$ and time $t$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) = (U_0 + kx) \\hat{i} + (-ky + C \\cos(\\omega t)) \\hat{j}\n$$\nHere, $U_0$ is a constant background flow velocity, $k$ is a positive constant representing the strain rate, $C$ is the amplitude of the pulsating velocity component, and $\\omega$ is its angular frequency. The vectors $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$ are the unit vectors in the Cartesian $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.\n\nDetermine the acceleration vector, $\\vec{a}$, of a fluid particle as a function of its position $(x, y)$ and time $t$. Provide your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $x, y, t,$ and the given constants.",
            "solution": "The acceleration of a fluid particle is given by the material derivative (or substantial derivative) of the velocity field, $\\mathbf{u}$. The material derivative, denoted by $\\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt}$, relates the Lagrangian (particle-based) acceleration to the Eulerian (field-based) description of the flow.\n\nThe formula for the material derivative in a Cartesian coordinate system is:\n$$\n\\vec{a}(x, y, z, t) = \\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}$ is the local acceleration, which accounts for the unsteadiness of the flow at a fixed point. The term $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$ is the convective acceleration, which accounts for the change in velocity as the particle moves from one point to another where the velocity is different.\n\nGiven the two-dimensional velocity field:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) = u_x \\hat{i} + u_y \\hat{j} = (U_0 + kx) \\hat{i} + (-ky + C \\cos(\\omega t)) \\hat{j}\n$$\nWe can identify its components:\n$u_x = U_0 + kx$\n$u_y = -ky + C \\cos(\\omega t)$\n\nFirst, we calculate the local acceleration term, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left( (U_0 + kx) \\hat{i} + (-ky + C \\cos(\\omega t)) \\hat{j} \\right)\n$$\nSince $U_0, k, x,$ and $y$ are not functions of $t$, the derivative of the $x$-component is zero. We only need to differentiate the $y$-component with respect to time:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} = 0 \\cdot \\hat{i} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(-ky + C \\cos(\\omega t)) \\hat{j} = (0 - C\\omega \\sin(\\omega t)) \\hat{j} = -C\\omega \\sin(\\omega t) \\hat{j}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the convective acceleration term, $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$. For a 2D flow, the operator $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla = u_x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + u_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\n$$\nWe apply this operator to the velocity vector $\\mathbf{u}$:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = \\left(u_x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + u_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) (u_x \\hat{i} + u_y \\hat{j}) = \\left(u_x \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} + u_y \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y}\\right) \\hat{i} + \\left(u_x \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} + u_y \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y}\\right) \\hat{j}\n$$\nWe need the partial derivatives of the velocity components with respect to space:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(U_0 + kx) = k\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(U_0 + kx) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-ky + C \\cos(\\omega t)) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-ky + C \\cos(\\omega t)) = -k\n$$\nNow we can compute the components of the convective acceleration. For the $x$-component of the convective acceleration:\n$$\na_{c,x} = u_x \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} + u_y \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} = (U_0 + kx)(k) + (-ky + C \\cos(\\omega t))(0) = k(U_0 + kx) = kU_0 + k^2x\n$$\nFor the $y$-component of the convective acceleration:\n$$\na_{c,y} = u_x \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} + u_y \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} = (U_0 + kx)(0) + (-ky + C \\cos(\\omega t))(-k) = k(ky - C \\cos(\\omega t)) = k^2y - kC \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nSo, the convective acceleration vector is:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = (kU_0 + k^2x) \\hat{i} + (k^2y - kC \\cos(\\omega t)) \\hat{j}\n$$\n\nFinally, we sum the local and convective acceleration vectors to find the total acceleration $\\vec{a}$:\n$$\n\\vec{a} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}\n$$\n$$\n\\vec{a} = (-C\\omega \\sin(\\omega t) \\hat{j}) + \\left( (kU_0 + k^2x) \\hat{i} + (k^2y - kC \\cos(\\omega t)) \\hat{j} \\right)\n$$\nCombining the components:\n$$\n\\vec{a} = (kU_0 + k^2x) \\hat{i} + (k^2y - kC \\cos(\\omega t) - C\\omega \\sin(\\omega t)) \\hat{j}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the acceleration vector of a fluid particle at any position $(x, y)$ and time $t$.",

            "introduction": "The material derivative elegantly connects the Eulerian and Lagrangian perspectives, but this connection can sometimes be counter-intuitive. This problem  presents a scenario where a stationary observer measures a property increasing locally, while a particle moving through that point experiences a net decrease in the same property. By resolving this apparent paradox, you will gain a deeper physical intuition for how the local rate of change and the convective rate of change combine to yield the total derivative experienced by the moving element.",

This advanced practice  bridges this gap by examining how we numerically approximate the material derivative, specifically its convective term.

            "problem": "Consider the advection of a passive thermal scalar field $\\phi(x,t)$ (for example, temperature) by a constant velocity $u0$ in one spatial dimension on a periodic domain. The governing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) is the statement that the material derivative is zero, namely $D\\phi/Dt=0$, which by definition is $D\\phi/Dt=\\partial \\phi/\\partial t + u\\,\\partial \\phi/\\partial x$. On a uniform grid with spacing $\\Delta x$, two common finite-difference approximations of the convective term $u\\,\\partial \\phi/\\partial x$ are:\n- The centered approximation: $u\\,(\\phi_{i+1}-\\phi_{i-1})/(2\\Delta x)$.\n- The first-order upwind approximation for $u0$: $u\\,(\\phi_{i}-\\phi_{i-1})/\\Delta x$.\nForm a semi-discrete system by replacing the spatial operator $u\\,\\partial \\phi/\\partial x$ with one of the two approximations above while keeping time continuous, so that $\\mathrm{d}\\phi_i/\\mathrm{d}t$ is governed by the chosen discrete spatial operator.
