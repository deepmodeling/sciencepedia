This exercise provides practice in applying the full material derivative to a velocity vector field, distinguishing between the local acceleration due to flow unsteadiness and the convective acceleration due to the particle's movement through a spatially varying velocity field. Mastering this calculation is the first step toward understanding how forces relate to flow dynamics in the Eulerian framework. ",

            "solution": "The acceleration of a fluid particle is given by the material derivative (or substantial derivative) of the velocity field, $\\vec{v}$. The material derivative, denoted by $\\frac{D\\vec{v}}{Dt}$, relates the Lagrangian (particle-based) acceleration to the Eulerian (field-based) description of the flow.\n\nThe formula for the material derivative in a Cartesian coordinate system is:\n$$\n\\vec{a}(x, y, z, t) = \\frac{D\\vec{v}}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\vec{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\vec{v}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\partial \\vec{v}}{\\partial t}$ is the local acceleration, which accounts for the unsteadiness of the flow at a fixed point.

This term damps gradients and causes loss of amplitude, so it is diffusive.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In the semi-discrete formulation, central differencing produces a leading-order term $+\\dfrac{u\\,\\Delta x^{2}}{6}\\,\\dfrac{\\partial^{3}\\phi}{\\partial x^{3}}$ within the convective operator, which is dispersive (phase error) but non-dissipative to leading order.**\nOur analysis shows that the discrete operator is $L_c(\\phi_i) = u (\\partial\\phi/\\partial x)_i + \\dfrac{u\\,\\Delta x^2}{6} (\\partial^3\\phi/\\partial x^3)_i + \\dots$. The term added to the exact operator $u\\,\\partial/\\partial x$ is indeed $+\\dfrac{u\\,\\Delta x^2}{6}\\,\\dfrac{\\partial^3\\phi}{\\partial x^3}$. This third-derivative term is dispersive. As there is no leading-order even derivative (e.g., $\\propto \\Delta x$), the scheme is non-dissipative to leading order. The statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. In the semi-discrete formulation, first-order upwind produces a leading-order term $+\\dfrac{u\\,\\Delta x}{2}\\,\\dfrac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial x^{2}}$ on the right-hand side of the material derivative, which is diffusive and damps gradients.**\nOur analysis shows the modified equation to be $\\underbrace{\\dfrac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t} + u \\dfrac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}}_{D\\phi/Dt} = +\\dfrac{u\\,\\Delta x}{2}\\dfrac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^2)$. The leading-order term on the right-hand side of the material derivative is precisely $+\\dfrac{u\\,\\Delta x}{2}\\dfrac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial x^2}$. This is a diffusion term (artificial viscosity), which is known to damp gradients and dissipate energy. The statement is **Correct**.\n\n**C. Because central differencing is non-dissipative, the semi-discrete central-difference advection operator is unconditionally stable under any explicit time integrator, independent of the time step.**\nThe eigenvalues of the semi-discrete central differencing operator on a periodic grid are purely imaginary: $\\lambda_k = -i \\dfrac{u}{\\Delta x}\\sin(k\\Delta x)$, where $k$ is the wavenumber. For a simple explicit method like Forward Euler, the time-stepping update is $\\phi^{n+1}_i = \\phi^n_i + \\Delta t (-\\mathbf{L}_c \\boldsymbol{\\phi}^n)$. The amplification factor for a mode is $g_k = 1 + \\Delta t \\lambda_k = 1 - i \\dfrac{u\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\sin(k\\Delta x)$. The stability requires $|g_k| \\le 1$. Here, $|g_k|^2 = 1^2 + \\left(\\dfrac{u\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\sin(k\\Delta x)\\right)^2 \\ge 1$. For any $\\Delta t  0$, there are modes for which $|g_k|  1$, meaning the scheme is unconditionally unstable. The claim of unconditional stability under *any* explicit integrator is false. The statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The first-order upwind semi-discrete operator preserves the discrete $\\ell^{2}$ energy exactly for periodic boundaries, so no amplitude decay occurs.**\nLet the discrete $\\ell^2$ energy be $E(t) = \\sum_i \\phi_i^2(t)$.

We test for skew-symmetry: $\\langle \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{L}_c \\mathbf{b} \\rangle = - \\langle \\mathbf{L}_c \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b} \\rangle$.\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{L}_c \\mathbf{b} \\rangle = \\sum_i a_i \\left( u \\frac{b_{i+1}-b_{i-1}}{2\\Delta x} \\right) = \\frac{u}{2\\Delta x} \\left( \\sum_i a_i b_{i+1} - \\sum_i a_i b_{i-1} \\right)\n$$\nUsing summation by parts with periodic boundaries (e.g., re-indexing $\\sum_i a_i b_{i+1} = \\sum_j a_{j-1}b_j$):\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{L}_c \\mathbf{b} \\rangle = \\frac{u}{2\\Delta x} \\left( \\sum_i a_{i-1} b_{i} - \\sum_i a_{i+1} b_{i} \\right) = \\frac{u}{2\\Delta x} \\sum_i b_i(a_{i-1}-a_{i+1})\n$$\n$$\n= - \\sum_i b_i \\left( u \\frac{a_{i+1}-a_{i-1}}{2\\Delta x} \\right) = - \\langle \\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{L}_c \\mathbf{a} \\rangle = - \\langle \\mathbf{L}_c \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b} \\rangle\n$$\nThe operator $\\mathbf{L}_c$ is indeed skew-symmetric. For the semi-discrete system $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\mathbf{L}_c \\boldsymbol{\\phi}$, the rate of change of the squared $\\ell^2$ norm, $E = \\langle \\boldsymbol{\\phi}, \\boldsymbol{\\phi} \\rangle$, is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\langle \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}{\\mathrm{d}t}, \\boldsymbol{\\phi} \\rangle + \\langle \\boldsymbol{\\phi}, \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\rangle = \\langle -\\mathbf{L}_c \\boldsymbol{\\phi}, \\boldsymbol{\\phi} \\rangle + \\langle \\boldsymbol{\\phi}, -\\mathbf{L}_c \\boldsymbol{\\phi} \\rangle = -\\langle \\mathbf{L}_c \\boldsymbol{\\phi}, \\boldsymbol{\\phi} \\rangle - \\langle \\boldsymbol{\\phi}, \\mathbf{L}_c \\boldsymbol{\\phi} \\rangle\n$$\nUsing skew-symmetry, $\\langle \\boldsymbol{\\phi}, \\mathbf{L}_c \\boldsymbol{\\phi} \\rangle = - \\langle \\mathbf{L}_c \\boldsymbol{\\phi}, \\boldsymbol{\\phi} \\rangle$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -(-\\langle \\boldsymbol{\\phi}, \\mathbf{L}_c \\boldsymbol{\\phi} \\rangle) - \\langle \\boldsymbol{\\phi}, \\mathbf{L}_c \\boldsymbol{\\phi} \\rangle = 0\n$$\nThe discrete $\\ell^2$ norm is conserved.
