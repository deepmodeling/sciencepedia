            "solution": "The problem describes a steady simple shear flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid. We are given the velocity field $\\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. For clarity and consistency with tensor notation, we will use $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ to represent $(x, y, z)$. The given velocity components are:\n$$\nu_1(x_1, x_2, x_3) = \\gamma x_2 \\\\\nu_2(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 0 \\\\\nu_3(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is a constant known as the shear rate.\n\nThe first step is to compute the velocity gradient tensor, $L_{ij}$, defined as $L_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}$. The components of this tensor are the partial derivatives of the velocity components with respect to the spatial coordinates.\n$$\nL_{11} = \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x_1} = 0, \\quad L_{12} = \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x_2} = \\gamma, \\quad L_{13} = \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x_3} = 0 \\\\\nL_{21} = \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_1} = 0, \\quad L_{22} = \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_2} = 0, \\quad L_{23} = \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_3} = 0 \\\\\nL_{31} = \\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial x_1} = 0, \\quad L_{32} = \\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial x_2} = 0, \\quad L_{33} = \\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial x_3} = 0\n$$\nIn matrix form, the velocity gradient tensor is:\n$$\nL_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem states the fluid is incompressible. The condition for incompressibility is that the divergence of the velocity field is zero, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$. In tensor notation, this is equivalent to the trace of the velocity gradient tensor being zero: $\\text{tr}(L) = L_{kk} = L_{11} + L_{22} + L_{33} = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$. The given velocity field correctly satisfies the incompressibility condition.\n\nThe velocity gradient tensor can be decomposed into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts. The symmetric part is the rate-of-strain tensor, $S_{ij}$, and the antisymmetric part is the spin (or vorticity) tensor, $W_{ij}$.\n\nThe rate-of-strain tensor is defined as $S_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(L_{ij} + L_{ji})$. Its components are calculated as follows:\n$$\nS_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}(L_{11} + L_{11}) = 0 \\\\\nS_{22} = \\frac{1}{2}(L_{22} + L_{22}) = 0 \\\\\nS_{33} = \\frac{1}{2}(L_{33} + L_{33}) = 0 \\\\\nS_{12} = S_{21} = \\frac{1}{2}(L_{12} + L_{21}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma + 0) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\\\\nS_{13} = S_{31} = \\frac{1}{2}(L_{13} + L_{31}) = \\frac{1}{2}(0 + 0) = 0 \\\\\nS_{23} = S_{32} = \\frac{1}{2}(L_{23} + L_{32}) = \\frac{1}{2}(0 + 0) = 0\n$$\nIn matrix form, the rate-of-strain tensor is:\n$$\nS_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{\\gamma}{2} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\gamma}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe spin tensor is defined as $W_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(L_{ij} - L_{ji})$. Its components are:\n$$\nW_{11} = W_{22} = W_{33} = 0 \\\\\nW_{12} = \\frac{1}{2}(L_{12} - L_{21}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma - 0) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\\\\nW_{21} = \\frac{1}{2}(L_{21} - L_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2}(0 - \\gamma) = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\\\\nW_{13} = W_{31} = 0, \\quad W_{23} = W_{32} = 0\n$$\nIn matrix form, the spin tensor is:\n$$\nW_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{\\gamma}{2} & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{\\gamma}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe total stress in the fluid is described by the Cauchy stress tensor, $\\sigma_{ij}$. For a fluid at rest or a frictionless fluid, the stress is purely isotropic and given by $-p\\delta_{ij}$, where $p$ is the pressure and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. In a viscous fluid undergoing motion, there are additional stresses due to friction, which constitute the deviatoric (or viscous) stress tensor, $\\tau_{ij}$. The total stress is then $\\sigma_{ij} = -p\\delta_{ij} + \\tau_{ij}$.\n\nThe constitutive relation for a fluid defines the relationship between the stress and the kinematics of the flow. For a Newtonian fluid, it is postulated that the deviatoric stress is a linear function of the rate of deformation. The rate of deformation is physically represented by the rate-of-strain tensor, $S_{ij}$, which describes how fluid elements stretch and shear. The spin tensor, $W_{ij}$, describes the local rate of rigid-body rotation of a fluid element, which does not cause deformation and thus does not generate viscous stress. Therefore, it is the rate-of-strain tensor $S_{ij}$ that contributes to the deviatoric stress, not the spin tensor $W_{ij}$.\n\nFor an isotropic, incompressible Newtonian fluid, the constitutive relation is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{ij} = 2\\mu S_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the constant dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nWe are asked to find the shear stress component $\\tau_{xy}$. In our index notation where $x_1=x$ and $x_2=y$, this corresponds to the component $\\tau_{12}$. Using the constitutive relation and our calculated value for $S_{12}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{12} = 2\\mu S_{12}\n$$\nSubstituting $S_{12} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{12} = 2\\mu \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\right) = \\mu\\gamma\n$$\nThus, the shear stress component $\\tau_{xy}$ is equal to the product of the dynamic viscosity and the shear rate.\n$$\n\\tau_{xy} = \\mu\\gamma\n$$\nThe problem asks for the expression for the stress, which, if $\\mu$ is given in pascal-seconds ($\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}$) and $\\gamma$ in inverse seconds ($\\text{s}^{-1}$), correctly yields units of Pascals ($\\text{Pa}$) for pressure/stress.",

            "solution": "The velocity field for a rigid-body rotation about the origin is given by $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{x}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$ is the constant angular velocity vector and $\\mathbf{x}$ is the position vector. In component form, using the Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk}$, the $i$-th component of the velocity vector $\\mathbf{u}$ is given by:\n$$\nu_i = \\epsilon_{imn} \\Omega_m x_n\n$$\nwhere summation over repeated indices is implied.\n\nFirst, we determine the velocity gradient tensor, $L_{ij}$, whose components are defined as $L_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}$. Differentiating the expression for $u_i$ with respect to $x_j$ yields:\n$$\nL_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} (\\epsilon_{imn} \\Omega_m x_n)\n$$\nSince the components of the angular velocity vector $\\Omega_m$ are constant, they can be treated as constants during differentiation. The derivative of the position vector component $x_n$ with respect to $x_j$ is the Kronecker delta, $\\frac{\\partial x_n}{\\partial x_j} = \\delta_{nj}$.\n$$\nL_{ij} = \\epsilon_{imn} \\Omega_m \\frac{\\partial x_n}{\\partial x_j} = \\epsilon_{imn} \\Omega_m \\delta_{nj}\n$$\nUsing the property of the Kronecker delta to contract the index $n$ with $j$, we get:\n$$\nL_{ij} = \\epsilon_{imj} \\Omega_m\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the velocity gradient tensor. We can observe that this tensor is antisymmetric. Let's check its transpose, $L_{ji}$:\n$$\nL_{ji} = \\epsilon_{jmi} \\Omega_m\n$$\nUsing the property of the Levi-Civita symbol that swapping any two indices introduces a negative sign, $\\epsilon_{jmi} = -\\epsilon_{imj}$, we have:\n$$\nL_{ji} = -\\epsilon_{imj} \\Omega_m = -L_{ij}\n$$\nThus, $L = -L^T$, confirming that the velocity gradient tensor for rigid-body rotation is purely antisymmetric. This tensor is also known as the spin or vorticity tensor, $W$.\n\nNext, we calculate the rate-of-strain tensor, $S_{ij}$. By definition, it is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor:\n$$\nS_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} (L_{ij} + L_{ji})\n$$\nSubstituting the relationship $L_{ji} = -L_{ij}$ that we just derived:\n$$\nS_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} (L_{ij} - L_{ij}) = 0\n$$\nThis result shows that the rate-of-strain tensor for a fluid in rigid-body rotation is the zero tensor. This is physically consistent, as rigid-body motion involves no deformation or stretching of fluid elements relative to one another.\n\nNow, we determine the deviatoric stress tensor, $\\tau_{ij}$. The problem states that for a Newtonian fluid, $\\tau_{ij}$ is a linear, isotropic function of the rate-of-strain tensor $S_{ij}$. The most general such relationship is:\n$$\n\\tau_{ij} = 2\\mu S_{ij} + \\lambda S_{kk} \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $\\lambda$ is the second coefficient of viscosity. In fluid dynamics, this is often expressed using the bulk viscosity $\\zeta = \\lambda + \\frac{2}{3}\\mu$, which leads to the relation $\\tau_{ij} = 2\\mu \\left( S_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3} S_{kk} \\delta_{ij} \\right) + \\zeta S_{kk} \\delta_{ij}$. The term $S_{kk} = \\text{tr}(S)$ represents the trace of the rate-of-strain tensor, which is equal to the divergence of the velocity field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$. For an incompressible flow, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$, which implies $S_{kk} = 0$. Let's verify the incompressibility condition for this flow:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = \\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_k} = L_{kk} = \\epsilon_{kmk} \\Omega_m\n$$\nThe term $\\epsilon_{kmk}$ is always zero because the Levi-Civita symbol is non-zero only if all three indices are distinct, whereas here, the first and last indices are the same (summed over $k$). Therefore, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$, the flow is incompressible, and $S_{kk} = 0$.\n\nFor an incompressible Newtonian fluid, the constitutive relation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\tau_{ij} = 2\\mu S_{ij}\n$$\nSince we have already established that $S_{ij} = 0$ for this flow, the deviatoric stress tensor is:\n$$\n\\tau_{ij} = 2\\mu (0) = 0\n$$\nThe deviatoric stress tensor is also the zero tensor.\n\nPhysical Implications:\n1.  **Energy Dissipation**: The rate of viscous dissipation of mechanical energy into heat per unit volume, $\\Phi$, is given by the product of the viscous stress and the rate of strain: $\\Phi = \\tau_{ij} S_{ij}$. In this case, since both $S_{ij}$ and $\\tau_{ij}$ are zero, the viscous dissipation rate is $\\Phi = 0$. This means that no mechanical energy is converted to internal energy due to viscosity in a rigid-body rotation. This is because viscosity generates stress and dissipates energy only in the presence of fluid deformation (strain rate). In rigid-body rotation, fluid elements translate and rotate without changing shape, so there is no mechanism for viscous forces to act and do work.\n\n2.  **Frame Indifference**: The principle of material frame-indifference (or objectivity) is a fundamental axiom in continuum mechanics stating that constitutive laws must be independent of the observer. A rigid-body rotation is equivalent to a change in the observer's reference frame. The velocity gradient tensor $L_{ij}$ is not an objective tensor because its value depends on the observer's motion. It can be decomposed into an objective symmetric part (the rate-of-strain tensor $S_{ij}$) and a non-objective antisymmetric part (the spin tensor $W_{ij}$). Our calculation shows that for rigid-body motion, $L_{ij}$ is purely spin ($S_{ij}=0$, $L_{ij}=W_{ij}$). A physically correct constitutive law, like that for a Newtonian fluid, must relate objective quantities. The viscous stress $\\tau_{ij}$ is related to the rate-of-strain $S_{ij}$, not the full velocity gradient $L_{ij}$. The result that $\\tau_{ij}=0$ for a pure spin motion ($S_{ij}=0$) is a direct consequence and verification of this principle. If stress were a function of $L_{ij}$, a stationary fluid would appear to have nonzero viscous stresses to a rotating observer, which is physically nonsensical. In computational thermal engineering, especially when using moving or rotating meshes (e.g., in turbomachinery simulations), it is critical that the numerical discretization of the constitutive law respects this principle to avoid generating spurious, non-physical stresses and energy dissipation due to mesh motion alone. The use of the rate-of-strain tensor $S_{ij}$ correctly isolates the deformation that generates real physical stresses.\n\nIn summary, the rate-of-strain and deviatoric stress tensors for a Newtonian fluid in rigid-body rotation are both zero.\nThe final analytical tensor expressions are:\nFor the rate-of-strain tensor: $S_{ij} = 0$.\nFor the deviatoric stress tensor: $\\tau_{ij} = 0$.",
