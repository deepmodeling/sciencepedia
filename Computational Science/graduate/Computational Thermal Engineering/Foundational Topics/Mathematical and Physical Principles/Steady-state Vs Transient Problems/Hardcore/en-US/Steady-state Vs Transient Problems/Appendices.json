Can an object be treated as a single, uniform-temperature entity (a 'lumped-capacitance' system), or must we solve for the temperature field within it? This practice guides you through the first-principles derivation of the Biot number, $Bi$, a dimensionless parameter that quantitatively answers this question by comparing internal conductive resistance to external convective resistance. By applying it to a concrete scenario, you will develop the physical intuition needed to select an appropriate modeling strategy. ",

            "problem": "A homogeneous planar slab with half-thickness $L_c$ is initially at a uniform temperature $T_i$ and, at time $t=0$, both of its faces are suddenly exposed to a fluid at temperature $T_{\\infty}$ with a constant convection coefficient $h$. The slab has thermal conductivity $k$. You are to determine, from first principles, whether the transient thermal response should be modeled as a spatially uniform lumped-capacitance system or requires spatial resolution of the temperature field, and to estimate the expected internal temperature gradient magnitude at the surface at the onset of the transient ($t \\to 0^{+}$).

            "solution": "The problem will be addressed in two parts: first, a determination of the appropriate thermal model (lumped-capacitance vs. spatially resolved), and second, the calculation of the surface temperature gradient at the onset of the transient process.\n\nWe establish a coordinate system with the origin $x=0$ at the center of the planar slab, such that the slab occupies the region $-L_c \\le x \\le L_c$. The slab is homogeneous with thermal conductivity $k$, initially at a uniform temperature $T(x, 0) = T_i$. At time $t=0$, the surfaces at $x = \\pm L_c$ are exposed to a fluid at temperature $T_{\\infty}$ with a convection coefficient $h$. Due to symmetry, we only need to analyze the region $0 \\le x \\le L_c$.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Appropriate Thermal Model**\n\nThe choice between a lumped-capacitance model and a spatially resolved model depends on the relative magnitudes of the internal (conductive) and external (convective) resistances to heat transfer.\n\nA lumped-capacitance model is valid if the temperature within the solid is approximately uniform at any given time, i.e., $T(x, t) \\approx T(t)$. This implies that the temperature difference within the slab is negligible compared to the temperature difference between the slab's surface and the surrounding fluid.\n\nLet us formalize this from first principles. The heat flux, $q''$, flowing from the center of the slab to the ambient fluid must overcome two thermal resistances in series: the internal conductive resistance of the slab and the external convective resistance at the surface.\n\nThe characteristic thermal resistance for heat conduction per unit area, $R''_{\\text{cond}}$, over the half-thickness $L_c$ is given by:\n$$ R''_{\\text{cond}} = \\frac{L_c}{k} $$\n\nThe thermal resistance for heat convection per unit area, $R''_{\\text{conv}}$, at the surface is:\n$$ R''_{\\text{conv}} = \\frac{1}{h} $$\n\nThe temperature drop across the slab's interior (from center to surface), $\\Delta T_{\\text{int}}$, and the temperature drop across the fluid boundary layer (from surface to ambient), $\\Delta T_{\\text{ext}}$, are related to the heat flux $q''$ by these resistances:\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\text{int}} = q'' \\cdot R''_{\\text{cond}} = q'' \\frac{L_c}{k} $$\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\text{ext}} = q'' \\cdot R''_{\\text{conv}} = q'' \\frac{1}{h} $$\n\nThe lumped-capacitance assumption is valid when the internal temperature drop is much smaller than the external temperature drop, i.e., $\\Delta T_{\\text{int}} \\ll \\Delta T_{\\text{ext}}$. The ratio of these temperature drops provides a quantitative criterion:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta T_{\\text{int}}}{\\Delta T_{\\text{ext}}} = \\frac{q'' (L_c/k)}{q'' (1/h)} = \\frac{h L_c}{k} $$\n\nThis dimensionless ratio is known as the Biot number, $Bi$.\n$$ Bi = \\frac{h L_c}{k} $$\nIt represents the ratio of the internal conductive resistance to the external convective resistance. For the lumped-capacitance approximation to be appropriate, this ratio must be small, conventionally $Bi \\ll 1$. A widely used engineering threshold is $Bi  0.1$.\n\nWe now calculate the Biot number using the provided values: $h = 220\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$, $L_c = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $k = 25\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n$$ Bi = \\frac{(220\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}) \\cdot (0.020\\,\\mathrm{m})}{25\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}} = \\frac{4.4}{25} = 0.176 $$\nSince $Bi = 0.176$, which is greater than the threshold of $0.1$, the internal conductive resistance is not negligible compared to the external convective resistance. The temperature gradients within the slab will be significant, and a spatially uniform temperature assumption is not valid. Therefore, a spatially resolved model is required.\n\nAccording to the problem definition, this corresponds to the classification indicator $S=0$.\n\n**Part 2: Surface Temperature Gradient at $t \\to 0^{+}$**\n\nThe transient heat transfer process is governed by the one-dimensional heat equation. At the surface $x=L_c$, an energy balance must be maintained for all $t  0$. The rate of heat conducted to the surface from the interior must equal the rate of heat convected away from the surface to the fluid. This is expressed by the convection boundary condition:\n$$ -k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=L_c} = h [T(L_c, t) - T_{\\infty}] $$\nWe are interested in the state of the system at the very onset of the transient, i.e., as $t \\to 0^{+}$. In any physical medium with finite thermal diffusivity, temperature is a continuous function of time at any given spatial point. Therefore, the temperature at any point inside the slab, including the surface, cannot change instantaneously. At the moment immediately following $t=0$, the temperature at the surface has not yet had time to deviate from its initial value.\nThus, we have:\n$$ T(L_c, t \\to 0^{+}) = T(L_c, 0) = T_i $$\nSubstituting this into the boundary condition equation for the limit $t \\to 0^{+}$:\n$$ -k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=L_c, \\, t \\to 0^{+}} = h [T(L_c, t \\to 0^{+}) - T_{\\infty}] = h [T_i - T_{\\infty}] $$\nSolving for the temperature gradient at the surface as $t \\to 0^{+}$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=L_c, \\, t \\to 0^{+}} = -\\frac{h}{k} (T_i - T_{\\infty}) $$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of this gradient:\n$$ \\left| \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=L_c, \\, t \\to 0^{+}} = \\left| -\\frac{h}{k} (T_i - T_{\\infty}) \\right| = \\frac{h}{k} |T_i - T_{\\infty}| $$\nUsing the given numerical values: $h = 220\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$, $k = 25\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, $T_i = 80\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, and $T_{\\infty} = 20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The temperature difference is $T_i - T_{\\infty} = (80 - 20)\\,\\mathrm{K} = 60\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$$ \\left| \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=L_c, \\, t \\to 0^{+}} = \\frac{220\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}}{25\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}} (60\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 8.8 \\cdot 60\\,\\mathrm{K\\,m^{-1}} = 528\\,\\mathrm{K\\,m^{-1}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the magnitude of the gradient is $528.0\\,\\mathrm{K\\,m^{-1}}$.\n\n**Summary of Results**\n1.

The material properties provided for copper are standard and realistic. The setup is physically plausible.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem specifies a PDE (to be derived from first principles), boundary conditions (Dirichlet type), and an initial condition. This constitutes a well-posed initial-boundary value problem, which is expected to have a unique and stable solution.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and mathematical language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**1. Governing PDE for $T(x,t)$**\nThe principle of local energy conservation for a one-dimensional element of the rod of length $\\Delta x$ and cross-sectional area $A_{c}$ states that the rate of change of internal energy equals the net rate of heat conducted into the element. There is no internal generation.\nThe rate of change of internal energy in the volume $A_{c}\\Delta x$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\rho c T(x',t) A_{c} dx' = \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} A_{c} dx'\n$$\nThe rate of heat conduction is given by Fourier's law, $q(x,t) = -k A_{c} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$. The net rate of heat conducted into the element is $q(x,t) - q(x+\\Delta x,t)$.\nEquating these gives:\n$$\n\\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\rho c A_{c} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} dx' = -k A_{c} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x} - \\left(-k A_{c} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x+\\Delta x}\\right)\n$$\nDividing by $A_{c}\\Delta x$ and taking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} \\frac{k\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\big|_{x+\\Delta x} - k\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\big|_{x}}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right)\n$$\nSince the thermal conductivity $k$ is constant, the governing PDE is:\n$$\n\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\implies \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c)$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\n**2. Steady-State Problem for $T_s(x)$**\nAt steady state, the temperature does not change with time, so $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = 0$. The PDE simplifies to an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) for the steady-state temperature profile $T_s(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 T_s}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are time-independent: $T_s(0) = 350$ and $T_s(L) = 300$.\nIntegrating the ODE twice yields a linear profile: $T_s(x) = C_1 x + C_2$.\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n- $T_s(0) = C_2 = 350$.\n- $T_s(L) = C_1 L + 350 = 300 \\implies C_1 L = -50 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{50}{L}$.\nSo, the steady-state temperature distribution is:\n$$\nT_s(x) = 350 - \\frac{50}{L}x\n$$\n\n**3. Homogeneous Problem for the Deviation Field $\\theta(x,t)$**\nWe define the deviation field $\\theta(x,t) = T(x,t) - T_s(x)$. By the principle of superposition for linear PDEs, we can formulate a problem for $\\theta(x,t)$.\nSubstitute $T(x,t) = \\theta(x,t) + T_s(x)$ into the heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\theta + T_s) = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(\\theta + T_s) \\implies \\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2\\theta}{\\partial x^2} + \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T_s}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nSince $T_s(x)$ is the steady-state solution, $\\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial t} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 T_s}{\\partial x^2} = 0$. The PDE for $\\theta$ is therefore homogeneous:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2\\theta}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions for $\\theta$ become homogeneous (Dirichlet-type):\n- $\\theta(0,t) = T(0,t) - T_s(0) = 350 - 350 = 0$.\n- $\\theta(L,t) = T(L,t) - T_s(L) = 300 - \\left(350 - \\frac{50}{L}L\\right) = 300 - 300 = 0$.\nThe initial condition for $\\theta$ is:\n- $\\theta(x,0) = T(x,0) - T_s(x) = \\left(T_s(x) + A \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) - T_s(x) = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.\n\n**4. Sturm-Liouville Eigenvalue Problem**\nWe solve the homogeneous PDE for $\\theta(x,t)$ using separation of variables. Let $\\theta(x,t) = X(x)\\mathcal{T}(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE gives:\n$$\nX(x)\\frac{d\\mathcal{T}}{dt} = \\alpha \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}\\mathcal{T}(t) \\implies \\frac{1}{\\alpha \\mathcal{T}}\\frac{d\\mathcal{T}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{X}\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -\\lambda\n$$\nwhere $-\\lambda$ is the separation constant. This yields a temporal ODE and a spatial ODE.\nThe spatial part forms a Sturm-Liouville problem with the homogeneous boundary conditions $X(0)=0$ and $X(L)=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} + \\lambda X = 0, \\quad X(0)=0, \\quad X(L)=0\n$$\nThe general solution for $\\lambda  0$ is $X(x) = C_1 \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda} x) + C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda} x)$.\n- $X(0) = C_1 = 0$.\n- $X(L) = C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda} L) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($C_2 \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda} L) = 0$.\nThis condition is satisfied if $\\sqrt{\\lambda}L = n\\pi$ for integer $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$, and the corresponding eigenfunctions are $X_n(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.\nThe first eigenvalue, corresponding to $n=1$, is:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2\n$$\n\n**5. Time Estimation for Decay**\nThe temporal solution is $\\frac{d\\mathcal{T}_n}{dt} = -\\lambda_n \\alpha \\mathcal{T}_n$, which gives $\\mathcal{T}_n(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda_n \\alpha t)$.\nThe general solution for $\\theta(x,t)$ is a superposition of modes:\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\exp(-\\lambda_n \\alpha t) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nWe find the coefficients $B_n$ from the initial condition:\n$$\n\\theta(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nBy inspection, the initial condition is purely the first mode ($n=1$). Therefore, $B_1 = A$ and $B_n=0$ for all $n  1$. The solution for the deviation is exactly the slowest decaying mode:\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) = A \\exp(-\\lambda_1 \\alpha t) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) = A \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\alpha t\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThe maximum absolute deviation at any time $t$ is the $L^{\\infty}$-norm, $\\|\\theta(\\cdot,t)\\|_{\\infty}$, which occurs where $|\\sin(\\pi x/L)|=1$:\n$$\n\\|\\theta(\\cdot,t)\\|_{\\infty} = \\max_{x \\in [0,L]} |\\theta(x,t)| = |A| \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\alpha t\\right)\n$$\nThe initial maximum absolute deviation at $t=0$ is $\\|\\theta(\\cdot,0)\\|_{\\infty} = |A|$.\nWe need to find the time $t_{0.01}$ such that the ratio of these maxima is less than or equal to $0.01$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\|\\theta(\\cdot,t_{0.01})\\|_{\\infty}}{\\|\\theta(\\cdot,0)\\|_{\\infty}} = \\frac{|A| \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\alpha t_{0.01}\\right)}{|A|} = \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\alpha t_{0.01}\\right) \\le 0.01\n$$\nSolving for the smallest time $t_{0.01}$ gives the equality:\n$$\n-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\alpha t_{0.01} = \\ln(0.01) = -\\ln(100)\n$$\n$$\nt_{0.01} = \\frac{L^2 \\ln(100)}{\\pi^2 \\alpha}\n$$\n\n**6.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, mathematically consistent, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The governing equations, boundary conditions, and numerical methods are standard in the field of computational heat transfer. The provided analytical steady-state solution is correct, as verified by substitution into the steady-state differential equation and checking the boundary conditions. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts: a derivation and verification of the physical model, a formulation and analysis of the numerical methods, and a discussion of the error components and simulation strategy.\n\n### 1. Model Derivation and Verification\n\nThe transient heat equation is derived from the principle of energy conservation. For a one-dimensional control volume with cross-sectional area $A$ extending from $x$ to $x+\\Delta x$, the conservation of energy states that the rate of change of internal energy is equal to the net rate of heat conducted into the volume plus the rate of energy generated within the volume. In differential form, this is:\n$$\n\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial q_x}{\\partial x} + Q'''\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the material density, $c$ is the specific heat capacity, $T(x,t)$ is the temperature, $q_x$ is the heat flux in the $x$-direction, and $Q'''$ is the volumetric heat generation rate.\n\nFourier's law of heat conduction provides a constitutive relation for the heat flux, stating that it is proportional to the negative of the temperature gradient:\n$$\nq_x = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity. Substituting Fourier's law into the energy conservation equation, assuming homogeneous material properties ($k, \\rho, c$ are constant), yields:\n$$\n\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right) + Q''' = k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + Q'''\n$$\nDividing by $\\rho c$ gives the final form of the heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k}{\\rho c} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{Q'''}{\\rho c}\n$$\nLetting the thermal diffusivity be $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c)$ and defining a source term with units of temperature per time as $s(x) = Q'''/(\\rho c)$, we arrive at the governing equation provided in the problem:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T(x,t)}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} + s(x)\n$$\nThe Dirichlet boundary conditions $T(0,t)=0\\,\\text{K}$ and $T(L,t)=0\\,\\text{K}$ are physically appropriate for a rod whose ends are maintained at a constant reference temperature. The initial condition $T(x,0)=0\\,\\text{K}$ specifies that the entire rod is at this reference temperature at time $t=0$.\n\nThe specific source term $s(x) = \\alpha S_0 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ is chosen to facilitate analytical verification. The steady-state solution $T_s(x)$ is found by setting the time derivative to zero, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = 0$:\n$$\n\\alpha \\frac{d^2 T_s(x)}{dx^2} + s(x) = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\alpha \\frac{d^2 T_s(x)}{dx^2} = -\\alpha S_0 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 T_s(x)}{dx^2} = -S_0 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nIntegrating twice with respect to $x$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d T_s(x)}{dx} = S_0 \\frac{L}{\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) + C_1\n$$\n$$\nT_s(x) = S_0 \\frac{L^2}{\\pi^2} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) + C_1 x + C_2\n$$\nApplying the boundary conditions to find the integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$T_s(0) = 0 \\implies S_0 \\frac{L^2}{\\pi^2} \\sin(0) + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2=0$.\n$T_s(L) = 0 \\implies S_0 \\frac{L^2}{\\pi^2} \\sin(\\pi) + C_1 L = 0 \\implies C_1 L = 0 \\implies C_1=0$.\nThus, the exact steady-state solution is indeed $T_s(x) = S_0 \\frac{L^2}{\\pi^2} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$, which confirms the problem statement.\n\n### 2. Numerical Method Formulation and Analysis\n\nThe problem is solved numerically using the method of lines, where the spatial domain is discretized first, converting the partial differential equation (PDE) into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which is then solved using a time integration scheme.\n\n**Spatial Discretization:**\nThe spatial domain $[0, L]$ is discretized with $N$ equally spaced interior points $x_i = i h$ for $i=1, \\dots, N$, and boundary points $x_0=0$ and $x_{N+1}=L$. The grid spacing is $h=L/(N+1)$. The second spatial derivative at an interior node $x_i$ is approximated using a second-order centered finite difference formula, derived from Taylor series expansions:\n$$\nT(x_i+h) = T(x_i) + h \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_i} + \\frac{h^2}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{x_i} + O(h^3)\n$$\n$$\nT(x_i-h) = T(x_i) - h \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_i} + \\frac{h^2}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{x_i} + O(h^3)\n$$\nAdding these two expansions and solving for the second derivative gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{x_i} = \\frac{T(x_{i+1}) - 2T(x_i) + T(x_{i-1})}{h^2} + O(h^2)\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the PDE for each interior node $T_i(t) \\approx T(x_i, t)$ yields a system of $N$ coupled ODEs:\n$$\n\\frac{d T_i(t)}{dt} = \\alpha \\frac{T_{i+1}(t) - 2T_i(t) + T_{i-1}(t)}{h^2} + s(x_i), \\quad i=1, \\dots, N\n$$\nThe boundary conditions $T(0,t)=T_0=0$ and $T(L,t)=T_{N+1}=0$ are incorporated at $i=1$ and $i=N$. Let $\\mathbf{T}(t) = [T_1(t), \\dots, T_N(t)]^T$ be the vector of temperatures at interior nodes and $\\mathbf{s}$ be the vector of source terms. The system can be written in matrix form:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathbf{T}(t)}{dt} = \\mathbf{A}\\,\\mathbf{T}(t) + \\mathbf{s}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{A} = \\alpha \\mathbf{D}$. The matrix $\\mathbf{D}$ is an $N \\times N$ tridiagonal matrix with entries $\\mathbf{D}_{ii} = -2/h^2$ and $\\mathbf{D}_{i, i\\pm 1} = 1/h^2$, which is the discrete Laplacian operator.\n\n**Temporal Discretization and Stability:**\nThe system of ODEs is advanced in time using the backward (implicit) Euler scheme. The time derivative at step $n+1$ is approximated by a backward difference: $\\frac{d\\mathbf{T}}{dt} \\approx \\frac{\\mathbf{T}^{n+1} - \\mathbf{T}^n}{\\Delta t}$. The scheme evaluates the right-hand side at the new time level $n+1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{T}^{n+1} - \\mathbf{T}^n}{\\Delta t} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{T}^{n+1} + \\mathbf{s}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the unknown $\\mathbf{T}^{n+1}$:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{I} - \\Delta t\\,\\mathbf{A})\\mathbf{T}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{T}^n + \\Delta t\\,\\mathbf{s}\n$$\nThis represents a linear system to be solved at each time step. To analyze stability, consider the homogeneous equation $\\dot{\\mathbf{T}} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{T}$. The backward Euler scheme is $\\mathbf{T}^{n+1} = (\\mathbf{I} - \\Delta t \\mathbf{A})^{-1} \\mathbf{T}^n$. Stability requires the spectral radius of the amplification matrix $\\mathbf{G} = (\\mathbf{I} - \\Delta t \\mathbf{A})^{-1}$ to be less than or equal to $1$. The eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$ are $\\lambda_j(\\mathbf{A}) = \\alpha \\lambda_j(\\mathbf{D}) = -\\frac{4\\alpha}{h^2}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{j\\pi}{2(N+1)}\\right)$ for $j=1, \\dots, N$. All eigenvalues $\\lambda_j(\\mathbf{A})$ are real and negative. The eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}$ are $g_j = (1 - \\Delta t \\lambda_j(\\mathbf{A}))^{-1}$. Since $\\lambda_j(\\mathbf{A})  0$ and $\\Delta t  0$, we have $1 - \\Delta t \\lambda_j(\\mathbf{A})  1$, which implies $|g_j|  1$ for all $j$. Therefore, the backward Euler method is unconditionally stable for this problem.\n\n**Asymptotic Behavior:**\nThe discrete steady state $\\mathbf{T}_d$ is found by setting the time derivative to zero in the semi-discrete system: $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{T}_d + \\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{0}$. The error from this steady state, $\\mathbf{e}^n = \\mathbf{T}^n - \\mathbf{T}_d$, evolves according to $\\mathbf{e}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{G} \\mathbf{e}^n$. After $N_t$ steps, $\\mathbf{e}^{N_t} = \\mathbf{G}^{N_t} \\mathbf{e}^0$. The norm of the transient error, $E_{\\text{transient}} = \\|\\mathbf{e}^{N_t}\\|_2$, decays with a rate governed by the largest eigenvalue (in magnitude) of $\\mathbf{G}$, which corresponds to the smallest magnitude eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{A}$, $\\lambda_1$. This slowest decaying mode has an eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 \\approx -\\alpha(\\pi/L)^2$. The transient error decays exponentially with time: $E_{\\text{transient}} \\propto |g_1|^{N_t} \\approx e^{\\lambda_1 t_{\\text{final}}}$. The characteristic time scale for this decay is $\\tau = -1/\\lambda_1 \\approx L^2/(\\alpha \\pi^2)$.\n\n### 3. Error Analysis and Simulation Strategy\n\nThe total error $E_{\\text{total}}$ is the difference between the final transient numerical solution $\\mathbf{T}^{N_t}$ and the exact steady-state solution sampled on the grid, $\\mathbf{T}_s$. By the triangle inequality, this error is bounded by the sum of the spatial and transient errors:\n$$\nE_{\\text{total}} = \\|\\mathbf{T}^{N_t} - \\mathbf{T}_s\\|_2 = \\|(\\mathbf{T}^{N_t} - \\mathbf{T}_d) + (\\mathbf{T}_d - \\mathbf{T}_s)\\|_2 \\le \\|\\mathbf{T}^{N_t} - \\mathbf{T}_d\\|_2 + \\|\\mathbf{T}_d - \\mathbf{T}_s\\|_2 = E_{\\text{transient}} + E_{\\text{spatial}}\n$$\n- $E_{\\text{spatial}}$ is the error due to the finite difference approximation. It is independent of the time-stepping and scales as $O(h^2)$ for this second-order scheme.\n- $E_{\\text{transient}}$ is the error due to not running the simulation to infinite time. It depends on $t_{\\text{final}}$ and decays exponentially.\n\nA principled strategy for obtaining an accurate numerical steady state is to ensure the transient error is negligible compared to the inherent spatial discretization error.\n1.  **Estimate the Spatial Error:** Based on the grid size $N$, one can anticipate the magnitude of $E_{\\text{spatial}}$. This establishes a target for the residual transient error.\n2.  **Choose a Sufficiently Large Final Time:** The final time $t_{\\text{final}}$ should be chosen to be several multiples of the characteristic diffusion time $\\tau = L^2/(\\alpha \\pi^2)$. For the given parameters, $\\tau = (1\\,\\text{m})^2 / (0.1\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s} \\cdot \\pi^2) \\approx 1.013\\,\\text{s}$. A choice of $t_{\\text{final}} = 5\\tau \\approx 5\\,\\text{s}$ would reduce the initial transient error by a factor of $e^{-5} \\approx 6.7 \\times 10^{-3}$, which is often sufficient.\n3.  **Choose the Time Step:** For the backward Euler scheme, $\\Delta t$ can be chosen based on computational cost, as stability is guaranteed. A larger $\\Delta t$ means fewer steps to reach $t_{\\text final}$, but it might poorly resolve the transient dynamics (which is not the goal here).\n4.  **Termination Condition:** In a practical setting where $t_{\\text{final}}$ is not fixed, one would iterate until the solution ceases to change significantly. A common termination criterion is when the discrete rate of change falls below a tolerance, e.g., $\\|\\mathbf{T}^{n+1} - \\mathbf{T}^n\\|_2 / \\Delta t  \\epsilon$, or when the residual of the steady-state equation is small, $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{T}^n + \\mathbf{s}\\|_2  \\epsilon'$. The tolerance $\\epsilon$ or $\\epsilon'$ would be chosen relative to the expected magnitude of $E_{\\text{spatial}}$.\n\nThe following program implements the described numerical solution and computes the requested error metrics for the specified test cases.",
