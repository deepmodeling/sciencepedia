            "problem": "A homogeneous, isotropic aluminum module is thermally well-stirred internally and is cooled only through one planar face that interfaces a large, well-stirred liquid bath. Between the module’s external face and the liquid bath there exist two series impediments to heat flow: a thin thermal interface layer of uniform thermal contact resistance and the liquid-side convective film. The liquid bath remains isothermal at temperature $T_{s}$ at all times. The module has mass $m$, constant specific heat $c$, and thermal conductivity $k$. The planar face of the module in contact with the interface layer has area $A$, and all other faces are perfectly insulated.

It describes a transient heat transfer scenario commonly modeled using the lumped capacitance method. The core assumption of this method is a spatially uniform temperature within the object, which is explicitly stated as the module being \"thermally well-stirred internally\".\n\nTo confirm the physical plausibility of this assumption, we can evaluate the Biot number, $Bi$. The lumped capacitance method is valid for $Bi \\ll 1$. The Biot number is defined as $Bi = \\frac{R_{cond}}{R_{conv,ext}}$, representing the ratio of internal (conduction) resistance to external (convection/surface) resistance. For this problem, the external resistance is a combination of contact and convective resistances. An equivalent definition is $Bi=\\frac{U L_c}{k}$, where $U$ is the overall heat transfer coefficient, $L_c$ is the characteristic length, and $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the solid.\n\nThe total external thermal resistance, $R_{tot}$, is the sum of the contact resistance $R_c$ and the convective resistance $R_{conv}$ in series:\n$$R_{tot} = R_{c} + R_{conv}$$\nThe convective resistance is given by $R_{conv} = \\frac{1}{hA}$.\n$$R_{conv} = \\frac{1}{(200\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(0.020\\ \\text{m}^{2})} = \\frac{1}{4.0}\\ \\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1} = 0.25\\ \\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1}$$\n$$R_{tot} = (3.00\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1}) + (0.25\\ \\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1}) = 0.253\\ \\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1}$$\nThe overall heat transfer coefficient $U$ is defined such that $\\frac{1}{UA} = R_{tot}$.\n$$U = \\frac{1}{A R_{tot}} = \\frac{1}{(0.020\\ \\text{m}^{2})(0.253\\ \\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1})} \\approx 197.6\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$$\nThe characteristic length $L_c$ for a plane wall of area $A$ and volume $V$, insulated on one face and cooled on the other, is its thickness $L = V/A$. The volume is $V=m/\\rho$.\n$$V = \\frac{0.25\\ \\text{kg}}{2700\\ \\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}} \\approx 9.259 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{m}^3$$\n$$L_c = L = \\frac{V}{A} = \\frac{9.259 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{m}^3}{0.020\\ \\text{m}^2} \\approx 4.63 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}$$\nThe Biot number is:\n$$Bi = \\frac{U L_c}{k} = \\frac{(197.6\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(4.63 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m})}{205\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}} \\approx 0.00446$$\nSince $Bi \\approx 0.00446 \\ll 0.1$, the assumption of a uniform internal temperature is fully justified. All provided data are consistent and physically realistic. The problem is well-posed and valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\nWe apply the first law of thermodynamics to the aluminum module, treated as a control mass. The rate of change of the module's internal energy, $\\frac{dE}{dt}$, must equal the net rate of heat transfer out of the module, $-\\dot{Q}_{out}$.\n$$\\frac{dE}{dt} = -\\dot{Q}_{out}$$\nAssuming constant specific heat $c$, the rate of change of internal energy is:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dt} = mc\\frac{dT}{dt}$$\nwhere $T(t)$ is the uniform temperature of the module at time $t$.\n\nThe heat transfer out of the module, $\\dot{Q}_{out}$, occurs through the series combination of the thermal contact resistance and the fluid-side convective resistance. The total rate of heat transfer is driven by the temperature difference between the module, $T(t)$, and the isothermal liquid bath, $T_s$.\n$$\\dot{Q}_{out} = \\frac{T(t) - T_s}{R_{tot}}$$\nThe total thermal resistance $R_{tot}$ is the sum of the given contact resistance $R_c$ and the convective resistance $R_{conv} = \\frac{1}{hA}$.\n$$R_{tot} = R_c + \\frac{1}{hA}$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the energy balance equation yields:\n$$mc\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\frac{T(t) - T_s}{R_c + \\frac{1}{hA}}$$\nThis is the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the module's temperature $T(t)$.\n\nTo identify the time constant, we introduce a new variable for the temperature difference, $\\theta(t) = T(t) - T_s$. Since $T_s$ is constant, $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\frac{dT}{dt}$. The ODE can be rewritten in terms of $\\theta(t)$:\n$$mc\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -\\frac{\\theta(t)}{R_c + \\frac{1}{hA}}$$\nRearranging into the standard form for a first-order linear homogeneous ODE:\n$$\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\left( \\frac{1}{mc(R_c + \\frac{1}{hA})} \\right) \\theta(t) = 0$$\nThis equation is of the form $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\theta = 0$, where $\\tau$ is the characteristic time constant of the exponential decay. By comparison, we identify the time constant $\\tau$ as:\n$$\\tau = mc\\left(R_c + \\frac{1}{hA}\\right)$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the time constant.\n\n**Step 4: Numerical Evaluation**\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the expression for $\\tau$.\n-   $m = 0.25\\ \\text{kg}$\n-   $c = 900\\ \\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n-   $R_c = 3.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1}$\n-   $h = 200\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n-   $A = 0.020\\ \\text{m}^{2}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal capacitance of the module, $C_{th} = mc$:\n$$C_{th} = (0.25\\ \\text{kg})(900\\ \\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) = 225\\ \\text{J}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$$\nNext, we calculate the convective thermal resistance, $R_{conv}$:\n$$R_{conv} = \\frac{1}{hA} = \\frac{1}{(200\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(0.020\\ \\text{m}^{2})} = \\frac{1}{4.0\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}} = 0.25\\ \\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1}$$\nThe total thermal resistance is:\n$$R_{tot} = R_c + R_{conv} = (3.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1}) + (0.25\\ \\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1}) = 0.253\\ \\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1}$$\nFinally, we calculate the time constant $\\tau = C_{th} R_{tot}$:\n$$\\tau = (225\\ \\text{J}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(0.253\\ \\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1})$$\nChecking the units: $[\\text{J}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}] \\times [\\text{K}\\,\\text{W}^{-1}] = [\\text{J}\\,\\text{W}^{-1}] = [\\text{J}\\,({\\text{J}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}})^{-1}] = [\\text{s}]$, which is correct for a time constant.\n$$\\tau = 56.925\\ \\text{s}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\tau \\approx 56.93\\ \\text{s}$$",

No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe analysis of transient heat conduction in this configuration is governed by two key dimensionless numbers: the Biot number ($Bi$) and the Fourier number ($Fo$).\n\nFirst, we define the characteristic length, $L_c$. For a plane wall of thickness $2L$ cooled symmetrically from both faces, the characteristic length is the half-thickness, $L$.\n$$L = L_c = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha$, of the polymer. The thermal diffusivity measures the material's ability to conduct thermal energy relative to its ability to store it.\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{k}{\\rho c_p}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{0.20\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}}{(1200\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (1500\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})} = \\frac{0.20}{1.8 \\times 10^6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}} \\approx 1.111 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$$\n\nThe Biot number, $Bi$, compares the internal thermal resistance to conduction within the solid to the external thermal resistance to convection at the surface.\n$$Bi = \\frac{h L_c}{k}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$Bi = \\frac{(300\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (0.010\\,\\mathrm{m})}{0.20\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}} = \\frac{3.0}{0.20} = 15$$\nA commonly used criterion for the lumped capacitance approximation (which assumes a uniform temperature distribution within the body) is $Bi \\ll 0.1$. Since our calculated Biot number is $Bi = 15$, which is significantly larger than $0.1$, the internal conduction resistance is dominant. This means substantial temperature gradients will develop within the slab, and the lumped capacitance model is not applicable.\n\nThe Fourier number, $Fo$, is a dimensionless time that compares the elapsed time of the transient process to the characteristic time for heat to diffuse across the length $L_c$.\n$$Fo = \\frac{\\alpha t}{L_c^2}$$\nUsing the experiment duration $t=2\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$$Fo = \\frac{(1.111 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (2\\,\\mathrm{s})}{(0.010\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\frac{2.222 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}}{1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}} \\approx 2.22 \\times 10^{-3}$$\nSo, $Fo \\approx 0.00222$. This value is much less than unity ($Fo \\ll 1$). A small Fourier number indicates that the observation time, $t$, is very short compared to the time required for the thermal front to penetrate deep into the material. The cooling effect is therefore concentrated in a thin layer near the surfaces of the slab. The interior of the slab will remain largely unaffected and close to its initial temperature, $T_i$.\n\nIn summary:\n1.  $Bi = 15 \\gg 0.1$: Internal conduction resistance is dominant, leading to large spatial temperature gradients. The lumped capacitance method is invalid.\n2.  $Fo \\approx 0.00222 \\ll 1$: The transient is in its very early stages. The thermal disturbance has only penetrated a small distance from the surface.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. $Fo \\ll 1$; only thin near-surface layers evolve within time $t$, and strong spatial temperature gradients persist across the slab; because the Biot number (Bi) is large, the lumped capacitance approximation is inappropriate and the interior remains close to $T_i$ at $t$.**\n- The statement that $Fo \\ll 1$ is consistent with our calculation of $Fo \\approx 0.00222$.\n- The interpretation that only thin near-surface layers evolve is a direct consequence of $Fo \\ll 1$.\n- The persistence of strong spatial temperature gradients is a direct consequence of $Bi \\gg 1$.\n- The claim that the lumped capacitance approximation is inappropriate because the Biot number is large is a fundamental principle of transient heat transfer, and our calculation shows $Bi = 15$, which is large.\n- The conclusion that the interior remains close to $T_i$ is the correct combined effect of a short dimensionless time ($Fo \\ll 1$) and high internal resistance ($Bi \\gg 1$).\nTherefore, this statement is fully consistent with the theoretical analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $Fo \\gg 1$; the temperature is nearly uniform through the thickness by time $t$, and the lumped capacitance approximation is valid regardless of the value of $Bi$.**\n- The premise $Fo \\gg 1$ is false; our calculation shows $Fo \\ll 1$.\n- The claim that the lumped capacitance approximation is valid regardless of the value of $Bi$ is fundamentally incorrect.

From this definition, we have $T(t) - T_\\infty = (T_i - T_\\infty) \\theta(t)$ and $\\frac{dT}{dt} = (T_i - T_\\infty) \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$. Substituting these into the energy balance equation:\n$$ \\rho R c (T_i - T_\\infty) \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -2h (T_i - T_\\infty) \\theta(t) $$\n\nThe term $(T_i - T_\\infty)$ cancels out, yielding a first-order ordinary differential equation for $\\theta(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -\\frac{2h}{\\rho c R} \\theta(t) $$\n\nThe initial condition is $T(0) = T_i$, which translates to $\\theta(0) = \\frac{T_i - T_\\infty}{T_i - T_\\infty} = 1$. The solution to this initial value problem is:\n$$ \\theta(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2h}{\\rho c R} t\\right) $$\n\nTo express this solution in terms of the Biot number ($\\mathrm{Bi} = \\frac{hR}{k}$) and the Fourier number ($\\mathrm{Fo} = \\frac{\\alpha t}{R^2} = \\frac{k t}{\\rho c R^2}$), we manipulate the exponent:\n$$ -\\frac{2h}{\\rho c R} t = -2 \\left(\\frac{hR}{k}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k}{\\rho c R^2}\\right) t = -2 \\, \\mathrm{Bi} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha t}{R^2}\\right) = -2 \\, \\mathrm{Bi} \\, \\mathrm{Fo} $$\n\nThus, the prediction of the Lumped Capacitance Method for the dimensionless temperature is:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{lumped}}(\\mathrm{Fo}) = \\exp(-2 \\, \\mathrm{Bi} \\, \\mathrm{Fo}) $$\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Exact Solution for Center Temperature\n\nThe exact solution is found by solving the governing partial differential equation with its associated boundary and initial conditions. The governing equation is the transient heat equation in cylindrical coordinates for one-dimensional radial heat flow:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial r}\\right)\\right) $$\n\nWe employ the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $\\theta(r,t) = F(r)G(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE yields:\n$$ F(r)\\frac{dG}{dt} = \\alpha G(t) \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dF}{dr}\\right) $$\n\nSeparating the variables gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\alpha G} \\frac{dG}{dt} = \\frac{1}{F} \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dF}{dr}\\right) = -\\lambda^2 $$\nwhere $-\\lambda^2$ is the separation constant. This results in two ordinary differential equations.\n\nThe temporal equation is $\\frac{dG}{dt} = -\\lambda^2 \\alpha G(t)$, with the solution $G(t) = C \\exp(-\\lambda^2 \\alpha t)$.\n\nThe spatial equation is $r\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dF}{dr}\\right) + \\lambda^2 r^2 F = 0$, which is Bessel's equation of order zero. Its general solution is $F(r) = A J_0(\\lambda r) + B Y_0(\\lambda r)$, where $J_0$ and $Y_0$ are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind of order zero, respectively.\n\nWe apply the boundary conditions to determine the constants $A$, $B$, and the eigenvalues $\\lambda$.\n1.  **Symmetry at the centerline ($r=0$)**: The condition $\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=0} = 0$ implies $\\left.\\frac{dF}{dr}\\right|_{r=0} = 0$. Since $Y_0(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to 0$, its derivative is also singular. To maintain a finite temperature gradient at the center, we must set $B=0$. The spatial solution is therefore $F(r) = A J_0(\\lambda r)$.\n2.  **Convection at the surface ($r=R$)**: The condition $-k \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=R} = h \\, \\theta(R,t)$ becomes $-k \\left.\\frac{dF}{dr}\\right|_{r=R} = h F(R)$. Substituting $F(r) = A J_0(\\lambda r)$ and its derivative $\\frac{dF}{dr} = -A \\lambda J_1(\\lambda r)$:\n    $$ -k (-A \\lambda J_1(\\lambda R)) = h (A J_0(\\lambda R)) $$\n    $$ k \\lambda J_1(\\lambda R) = h J_0(\\lambda R) $$\n    Rearranging gives the transcendental equation for the eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\lambda_n R J_1(\\lambda_n R)}{J_0(\\lambda_n R)} = \\frac{hR}{k} $$\n    Letting $\\zeta_n = \\lambda_n R$, this becomes the eigenvalue equation in dimensionless form:\n    $$ \\zeta_n \\frac{J_1(\\zeta_n)}{J_0(\\zeta_n)} = \\mathrm{Bi} $$\n    For a given $\\mathrm{Bi}$, this equation has an infinite number of positive discrete roots, $\\zeta_n$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nThe full solution is a superposition of all possible product solutions:\n$$ \\theta(r,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty C_n \\exp(-\\lambda_n^2 \\alpha t) J_0(\\lambda_n r) $$\nWe express the exponent in terms of the Fourier number: $\\lambda_n^2 \\alpha t = (\\frac{\\zeta_n}{R})^2 \\alpha t = \\zeta_n^2 (\\frac{\\alpha t}{R^2}) = \\zeta_n^2 \\mathrm{Fo}$.\nThe solution becomes:\n$$ \\theta(r,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty C_n \\exp(-\\zeta_n^2 \\mathrm{Fo}) J_0\\left(\\zeta_n \\frac{r}{R}\\right) $$\n\nThe coefficients $C_n$ are determined by the initial condition $\\theta(r,0) = 1$:\n$$ 1 = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty C_n J_0\\left(\\zeta_n \\frac{r}{R}\\right) $$\nThis is a Fourier-Bessel series expansion of the function $f(r)=1$. The eigenfunctions $J_0(\\lambda_n r)$ are orthogonal over the interval $[0, R]$ with respect to the weight function $r$. To find a specific coefficient $C_n$, we multiply by $r J_0(\\lambda_n r)$ and integrate from $0$ to $R$:\n$$ \\int_0^R r J_0(\\lambda_n r) dr = C_n \\int_0^R r J_0^2(\\lambda_n r) dr $$\n$$ C_n = \\frac{\\int_0^R r J_0(\\lambda_n r) dr}{\\int_0^R r J_0^2(\\lambda_n r) dr} $$\n\nThe integrals are standard forms:\n-   Numerator: Using the identity $\\frac{d}{dx}(x J_1(x))=x J_0(x)$, we have $\\int x J_0(x) dx = x J_1(x)$.\n    $$ \\int_0^R r J_0(\\lambda_n r) dr = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_n^2} \\int_0^{\\lambda_n R} u J_0(u) du = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_n^2} [\\lambda_n R J_1(\\lambda_n R)] = \\frac{R}{\\lambda_n} J_1(\\lambda_n R) $$\n-   Denominator: The standard integral is $\\int x J_0^2(\\alpha x) dx = \\frac{x^2}{2} (J_0^2(\\alpha x) + J_1^2(\\alpha x))$.\n    $$ \\int_0^R r J_0^2(\\lambda_n r) dr = \\frac{R^2}{2} (J_0^2(\\lambda_n R) + J_1^2(\\lambda_n R)) $$\n\nSubstituting these results and $\\zeta_n = \\lambda_n R$:\n$$ C_n = \\frac{\\frac{R^2}{\\zeta_n} J_1(\\zeta_n)}{\\frac{R^2}{2} (J_0^2(\\zeta_n) + J_1^2(\\zeta_n))} = \\frac{2 J_1(\\zeta_n)}{\\zeta_n (J_0^2(\\zeta_n) + J_1^2(\\zeta_n))} $$\nUsing the eigenvalue equation to simplify, $J_1(\\zeta_n) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Bi}}{\\zeta_n} J_0(\\zeta_n)$:\n$$ C_n = \\frac{2 (\\frac{\\mathrm{Bi}}{\\zeta_n} J_0(\\zeta_n))}{\\zeta_n (J_0^2(\\zeta_n) + (\\frac{\\mathrm{Bi}}{\\zeta_n})^2 J_0^2(\\zeta_n))} = \\frac{2 \\mathrm{Bi} J_0(\\zeta_n)}{\\zeta_n^2 J_0^2(\\zeta_n) (1 + (\\frac{\\mathrm{Bi}}{\\zeta_n})^2)} = \\frac{2 \\mathrm{Bi}}{(\\zeta_n^2 + \\mathrm{Bi}^2) J_0(\\zeta_n)} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the center temperature, $\\theta(0,t)$. Since $J_0(0)=1$, the series for the exact center temperature is:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{exact}}(0, \\mathrm{Fo}) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{2 \\mathrm{Bi}}{(\\zeta_n^2 + \\mathrm{Bi}^2) J_0(\\zeta_n)} \\exp(-\\zeta_n^2 \\mathrm{Fo}) $$\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Algorithm\n\nTo compute the maximum absolute difference between the lumped and exact solutions, $|\\theta_{\\text{lumped}}(\\mathrm{Fo}) - \\theta_{\\text{exact}}(0, \\mathrm{Fo})|$, over the interval $0 \\le \\mathrm{Fo} \\le \\mathrm{Fo}_{\\max}$, the following numerical procedure is implemented:\n1.  **Eigenvalue Calculation**: For a given $\\mathrm{Bi}$, the first $N$ positive roots, $\\zeta_n$, of the eigenvalue equation $\\zeta J_1(\\zeta) - \\mathrm{Bi} J_0(\\zeta) = 0$ are determined. This is a root-finding problem. The roots are located between the zeros of the $J_0$ Bessel function. Specifically, the $n$-th root $\\zeta_n$ lies in the interval $(j_{0,n-1}, j_{0,n})$, where $j_{0,n}$ is the $n$-th zero of $J_0(x)$ and $j_{0,0}=0$. The roots are found numerically using a bracketing algorithm like the Brent method. A sufficiently large number of roots, e.g., $N=100$, is used to ensure the series converges to the required accuracy.\n2.  **Series Evaluation**: The coefficients $C_n$ are calculated using the derived formula. The exact center temperature, $\\theta_{\\text{exact}}(0, \\mathrm{Fo})$, is then computed by summing the first $N$ terms of the series for each value of $\\mathrm{Fo}$ in a finely discretized grid over the interval $[0, \\mathrm{Fo}_{\\max}]$. The exponential term $\\exp(-\\zeta_n^2 \\mathrm{Fo})$ ensures rapid convergence for $\\mathrm{Fo}  0$.\n3.  **Difference Calculation**: The lumped capacitance solution, $\\theta_{\\text{lumped}}(\\mathrm{Fo})$, is calculated over the same grid of $\\mathrm{Fo}$ values. The absolute difference between the two solutions is computed at each point in the grid.\n4.  **Maximum Value**: The maximum value of this absolute difference over the entire grid is identified and reported as the result for the given test case. For the special case where $\\mathrm{Fo}_{\\max}=0$, the interval contains only the point $\\mathrm{Fo}=0$. At this point, both $\\theta_{\\text{lumped}}(0)$ and $\\theta_{\\text{exact}}(0,0)$ (which is $\\sum C_n$) are equal to $1$, so the difference is $0$.",
