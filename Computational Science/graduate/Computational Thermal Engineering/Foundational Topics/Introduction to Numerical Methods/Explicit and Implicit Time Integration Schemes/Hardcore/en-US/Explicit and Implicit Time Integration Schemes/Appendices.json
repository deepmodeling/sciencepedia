This practice guides you through a von Neumann stability analysis to quantify this limitation, allowing you to compute the maximum stable time step ($\\Delta t_{\\max}$) as a function of the material's thermal diffusivity ($\\alpha$) and the grid spacing ($\\Delta x$) . Mastering this analysis is essential for predicting the performance and feasibility of explicit methods for a given thermal problem.",

We are to analyze the stability of the Forward-Time Central-Space (FTCS) discretization scheme for this equation.\n\nLet us define a uniform grid with spatial step $\\Delta x$ and time step $\\Delta t$. The temperature at a grid node $i$ and time level $n$ is denoted by $T_i^n \\equiv T(i\\Delta x, n\\Delta t)$.\n\nThe FTCS scheme approximates the partial derivatives as follows:\nThe time derivative is approximated using a first-order forward difference:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\bigg|_{i,n} \\approx \\frac{T_i^{n+1} - T_i^n}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThe spatial second derivative is approximated using a second-order central difference:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\bigg|_{i,n} \\approx \\frac{T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the governing equation gives the discretized form of the FTCS scheme:\n$$\n\\frac{T_i^{n+1} - T_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right)\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve explicitly for the temperature at the next time step, $T_i^{n+1}$:\n$$\nT_i^{n+1} = T_i^n + \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} (T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n)\n$$\nLet us define the dimensionless Fourier number, $Fo$, also known as the diffusion number, as:\n$$\nFo = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nThe discretized equation simplifies to:\n$$\nT_i^{n+1} = T_i^n + Fo (T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n) = Fo \\, T_{i+1}^n + (1 - 2Fo)T_i^n + Fo \\, T_{i-1}^n\n$$\nTo determine the stability of this numerical scheme, we perform a von Neumann stability analysis. We consider the behavior of a single Fourier mode of the solution. Let the temperature distribution at time level $n$ be represented by a Fourier component:\n$$\nT_i^n = \\hat{T}^n(k) e^{I k x_i}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the wavenumber, $x_i = i\\Delta x$ is the spatial position of node $i$, and $I = \\sqrt{-1}$ is the imaginary unit. The amplitude of this mode at time $n$ is $\\hat{T}^n(k)$. After one time step, this mode will be amplified by a factor $G(k)$, the amplification factor:\n$$\nT_i^{n+1} = \\hat{T}^{n+1}(k) e^{I k x_i} = G(k) \\hat{T}^n(k) e^{I k x_i}\n$$\nFor the numerical scheme to be stable, the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed unity for any wavenumber $k$. The stability condition is:\n$$\n|G(k)| \\le 1\n$$\nWe substitute the Fourier mode representation into the discretized equation:\n$$\nG(k) \\hat{T}^n(k) e^{I k (i\\Delta x)} = Fo \\, \\hat{T}^n(k) e^{I k ((i+1)\\Delta x)} + (1 - 2Fo) \\hat{T}^n(k) e^{I k (i\\Delta x)} + Fo \\, \\hat{T}^n(k) e^{I k ((i-1)\\Delta x)}\n$$\nDividing by $\\hat{T}^n(k) e^{I k (i\\Delta x)}$ yields the expression for the amplification factor $G(k)$:\n$$\nG(k) = Fo \\, e^{I k \\Delta x} + (1 - 2Fo) + Fo \\, e^{-I k \\Delta x}\n$$\nUsing Euler's identity $e^{I\\theta} + e^{-I\\theta} = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, we can simplify this expression:\n$$\nG(k) = 1 - 2Fo + Fo (e^{I k \\Delta x} + e^{-I k \\Delta x}) = 1 - 2Fo + 2Fo \\cos(k \\Delta x)\n$$\n$$\nG(k) = 1 - 2Fo(1 - \\cos(k \\Delta x))\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identity $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$, we obtain:\n$$\nG(k) = 1 - 4Fo \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)\n$$\nNow we apply the stability condition $|G(k)| \\le 1$. Since $Fo > 0$, the term $4Fo \\sin^2(k\\Delta x/2)$ is non-negative. Therefore, $G(k)$ is always less than or equal to $1$. The stability is thus governed by the lower bound:\n$$\nG(k) \\ge -1\n$$\n$$\n1 - 4Fo \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\ge -1\n$$\n$$\n2 \\ge 4Fo \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\ge Fo \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all possible wavenumbers $k$. The most restrictive condition occurs when the term $\\sin^2(k\\Delta x/2)$ reaches its maximum value. The maximum value of $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ is $1$. This corresponds to the highest frequency (most rapidly oscillating) mode representable on the grid, where $k \\Delta x = \\pi$.\nThus, the condition for stability becomes:\n$$\nFo \\le \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nMarginal stability is achieved at the limit of this condition, where $Fo = 1/2$.

The most direct and physically consistent approach is to incorporate the Dirichlet boundary value $T_b$ directly into the finite difference stencil for the second derivative at node $i=1$.\n\nThe node $i=1$ is located at $x_1=\\Delta x$. Its neighbors are the boundary at $x=0$ and the node $i=2$ at $x_2=2\\Delta x$. We can use a standard three-point central difference formula for $\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}$ centered at $x_1$, using the points $x=0$, $x_1=\\Delta x$, and $x_2=2\\Delta x$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial^{2}T}{\\partial x^{2}} \\right|_{x_1} \\approx \\frac{T(x_1-\\Delta x) - 2T(x_1) + T(x_1+\\Delta x)}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nAt time level $n$, for node $i=1$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial^{2}T}{\\partial x^{2}} \\right|_{x_1, t_n} \\approx \\frac{T(0, t_n) - 2T(\\Delta x, t_n) + T(2\\Delta x, t_n)}{(\\Delta x)^2} = \\frac{T_{b} - 2T_{1}^{n} + T_{2}^{n}}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nThis approximation is second-order accurate. Substituting this into the time-discretized heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{T_{1}^{n+1} - T_{1}^{n}}{\\Delta t} = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{T_{b} - 2T_{1}^{n} + T_{2}^{n}}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right)\n$$\nSolving for $T_{1}^{n+1}$:\n$$\nT_{1}^{n+1} = T_{1}^{n} + \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} (T_{b} - 2T_{1}^{n} + T_{2}^{n})\n$$\nSubstituting the Fourier number, $\\mathrm{Fo}$:\n$$\nT_{1}^{n+1} = T_1^n + \\mathrm{Fo} (T_{b} - 2T_{1}^{n} + T_{2}^{n})\n$$\nGrouping terms by temperature values at time level $n$:\n$$\nT_{1}^{n+1} = (1 - 2\\mathrm{Fo})T_{1}^{n} + \\mathrm{Fo}\\,T_{2}^{n} + \\mathrm{Fo}\\,T_{b}\n$$\nThis is the corrected explicit update formula for the boundary node $i=1$.\nWe must verify that it meets the requirement of preserving non-negativity of coefficients for $\\mathrm{Fo} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$. The coefficients are:\n- Coefficient of $T_{1}^{n}$: $(1 - 2\\mathrm{Fo})$\n- Coefficient of $T_{2}^{n}$: $\\mathrm{Fo}$\n- Coefficient of $T_{b}$: $\\mathrm{Fo}$\n\nSince $\\mathrm{Fo} > 0$, the coefficients of $T_{2}^{n}$ and $T_{b}$ are always positive. The coefficient of $T_{1}^{n}$ is non-negative if $1 - 2\\mathrm{Fo} \\ge 0$, which is true for $\\mathrm{Fo} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, this corrected scheme satisfies the problem's requirements, as it is positivity-preserving under the standard stability condition for the explicit method. This scheme is often derived via a control-volume energy balance on a half-control-volume at the boundary, or simply by placing a computational node on the boundary, which yields the same result. The final expression is the derived update rule for $T_{1}^{n+1}$.",
