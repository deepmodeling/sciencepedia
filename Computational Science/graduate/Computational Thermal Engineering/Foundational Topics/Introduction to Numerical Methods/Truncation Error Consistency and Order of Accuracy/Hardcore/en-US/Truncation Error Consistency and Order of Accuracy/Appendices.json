            "solution": "The problem requires the analysis of a first-order upwind finite-difference scheme for the $1\\text{-D}$ linear advection equation. The analysis will proceed in three steps: first, the derivation of the local truncation error and order of accuracy; second, the construction of the modified partial differential equation (PDE); and third, the identification of the artificial diffusion term and its coefficient.\n\nThe governing PDE is the linear advection equation:\n$$\nu_t + a u_x = 0\n$$\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the transported scalar, $a  0$ is the constant advection speed, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $t$ is time. The spatial domain is discretized on a uniform grid $x_i = i \\Delta x$ with spacing $\\Delta x  0$. The partial derivative with respect to space, $u_x$, is approximated at grid point $x_i$ using the first-order upwind (backward-difference) scheme:\n$$\n(u_x)_i \\approx \\frac{u_i - u_{i-1}}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nwhere $u_i \\equiv u(x_i, t)$.\n\n**Part 1: Truncation Error and Order of Accuracy**\n\nThe local truncation error, $\\tau_i$, of the spatial discretization is the residual obtained when the exact solution $u(x,t)$ is substituted into the finite-difference formula. It is defined as the difference between the discrete operator and the continuous operator acting on the exact solution.\n\nLet the continuous differential operator be $L(u) = a u_x$.\nLet the discrete difference operator be $L_{\\Delta x}(u_i) = a \\frac{u_i - u_{i-1}}{\\Delta x}$.\n\nThe truncation error is then:\n$$\n\\tau_i = L_{\\Delta x}(u_i) - (L u)_i = a \\frac{u_i - u_{i-1}}{\\Delta x} - a (u_x)_i\n$$\nTo analyze $\\tau_i$, we perform a Taylor series expansion of the function $u(x, t)$ at the point $x_{i-1} = x_i - \\Delta x$ around the point $x_i$. Assuming sufficient smoothness of the solution $u(x,t)$, we have:\n$$\nu_{i-1} = u(x_i - \\Delta x, t) = u(x_i, t) - \\Delta x \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right)_i + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2!} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\right)_i - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^3}{3!} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^3 u}{\\partial x^3}\\right)_i + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^4)\n$$\nUsing the subscript notation for spatial derivatives, i.e., $(u_x)_i = (\\partial u/\\partial x)_i$, $(u_{xx})_i = (\\partial^2 u/\\partial x^2)_i$, etc., the expansion becomes:\n$$\nu_{i-1} = u_i - \\Delta x (u_x)_i + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2} (u_{xx})_i - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^3}{6} (u_{xxx})_i + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^4)\n$$\nSubstituting this expansion into the expression for the truncation error:\n$$\n\\tau_i = a \\frac{u_i - \\left(u_i - \\Delta x (u_x)_i + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2} (u_{xx})_i - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^3}{6} (u_{xxx})_i + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^4)\\right)}{\\Delta x} - a (u_x)_i\n$$\nSimplifying the terms in the numerator:\n$$\n\\tau_i = a \\frac{\\Delta x (u_x)_i - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2} (u_{xx})_i + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^3}{6} (u_{xxx})_i - \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^4)}{\\Delta x} - a (u_x)_i\n$$\nDividing by $\\Delta x$:\n$$\n\\tau_i = a \\left( (u_x)_i - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} (u_{xx})_i + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{6} (u_{xxx})_i - \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^3) \\right) - a (u_x)_i\n$$\nThe term $a (u_x)_i$ cancels out, leaving the expression for the truncation error:\n$$\n\\tau_i = - \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} (u_{xx})_i + \\frac{a (\\Delta x)^2}{6} (u_{xxx})_i - \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^3)\n$$\nThe order of accuracy is determined by the lowest power of $\\Delta x$ in the leading term of the truncation error. In this case, the leading term is $- \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} (u_{xx})_i$, which is proportional to $(\\Delta x)^1$. Therefore, the spatial discretization is first-order accurate with respect to $\\Delta x$.\n\n**Part 2: Modified Equation**\n\nThe modified equation is the PDE that is actually solved by the numerical scheme, including its error terms. We start with the semi-discrete scheme, where the spatial derivative is replaced by its finite-difference approximation:\n$$\n(u_t)_i + a \\frac{u_i - u_{i-1}}{\\Delta x} = 0\n$$\nWe have already found the Taylor series expansion for the discrete spatial term:\n$$\na \\frac{u_i - u_{i-1}}{\\Delta x} = a (u_x)_i - \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} (u_{xx})_i + \\frac{a (\\Delta x)^2}{6} (u_{xxx})_i - \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^3)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the semi-discrete equation gives:\n$$\n(u_t)_i + a (u_x)_i - \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} (u_{xx})_i + \\frac{a (\\Delta x)^2}{6} (u_{xxx})_i - \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^3) = 0\n$$\nWe can express this relationship for the continuous function $u(x,t)$ by dropping the subscript $i$. This equation represents the PDE that the numerical solution approximately satisfies. Rearranging it to match the structure of the original PDE plus error terms yields the modified equation:\n$$\nu_t + a u_x = \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} u_{xx} - \\frac{a (\\Delta x)^2}{6} u_{xxx} + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^3)\n$$\nThe problem asks for terms up to and including those proportional to $(\\Delta x)^2$. Thus, the modified equation is:\n$$\nu_t + a u_x = \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} u_{xx} - \\frac{a (\\Delta x)^2}{6} u_{xxx}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Artificial Diffusion Term and Coefficient**\n\nThe modified equation shows how the numerical scheme deviates from the original PDE. The terms on the right-hand side are error terms introduced by the discretization. The original equation, $u_t + a u_x = 0$, describes pure advection without any diffusion.\n\nThe leading error term in the modified equation is $\\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} u_{xx}$. This term has the form of a diffusion term, $D u_{xx}$, which is characteristic of the heat equation or diffusion equation. Since this term is an artifact of the numerical method and not part of the original physical model, it is called the \"artificial diffusion\" or \"numerical diffusion\" term.\n\nThis term is dissipative, meaning it tends to damp or smooth out sharp gradients in the solution, which is a known characteristic of the first-order upwind scheme. The positive sign of the coefficient (since $a > 0$ and $\\Delta x > 0$) confirms that it acts as a forward diffusion process, ensuring numerical stability at the cost of accuracy.\n\nBy comparing the leading error term to the general form of a diffusion term, $D_{art} u_{xx}$, we can extract the artificial diffusion coefficient, $D_{art}$.\n$$\nD_{art} u_{xx} = \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} u_{xx}\n$$\nTherefore, the artificial diffusion coefficient is:\n$$\nD_{art} = \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2}\n$$\nThis coefficient quantifies the amount of non-physical diffusion introduced by the scheme. It is directly proportional to both the advection speed $a$ and the grid spacing $\\Delta x$.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of computational science, specifically concerning the numerical analysis of partial differential equations. All parameters, equations, and procedures are clearly defined, allowing for a unique and verifiable solution. We shall proceed with the two tasks outlined.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the Local Truncation Error\n\nThe first task is to derive the local truncation error, $\\tau$, for the Lax-Wendroff (LW) scheme applied to the linear advection equation, $c_t + U c_x = 0$. The local truncation error is found by substituting the exact solution, $c(x,t)$, into the finite difference scheme and quantifying the residual.\n\nThe LW scheme is given as:\n$$\nc_i^{n+1} = c_i^n - \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\left(c_{i+1}^n - c_{i-1}^n\\right) + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2} \\left(c_{i+1}^n - 2 c_i^n + c_{i-1}^n\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda = \\frac{U \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$. To find the truncation error, we rearrange the scheme to represent the differential operator it approximates, $L = \\partial_t + U \\partial_x$.\n\nFirst, we divide by $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\frac{c_i^{n+1} - c_i^n}{\\Delta t} = - \\frac{U \\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x \\Delta t} \\left(c_{i+1}^n - c_{i-1}^n\\right) + \\frac{U^2 (\\Delta t)^2}{2 (\\Delta x)^2 \\Delta t} \\left(c_{i+1}^n - 2 c_i^n + c_{i-1}^n\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{c_i^{n+1} - c_i^n}{\\Delta t} = - \\frac{U}{2 \\Delta x} \\left(c_{i+1}^n - c_{i-1}^n\\right) + \\frac{U^2 \\Delta t}{2 (\\Delta x)^2} \\left(c_{i+1}^n - 2 c_i^n + c_{i-1}^n\\right)\n$$\nThe truncation error $\\tau(x,t)$ is defined as the residual when the exact solution $c(x,t)$ is substituted into the numerical operator. We evaluate all terms at the point $(x,t)$, which corresponds to $(x_i, t^n)$.\n$$\n\\tau(x,t) = \\frac{c(x, t+\\Delta t) - c(x, t)}{\\Delta t} + U \\frac{c(x+\\Delta x, t) - c(x-\\Delta x, t)}{2 \\Delta x} - \\frac{U^2 \\Delta t}{2} \\frac{c(x+\\Delta x, t) - 2c(x, t) + c(x-\\Delta x, t)}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nWe now perform Taylor series expansions for each term around the point $(x,t)$. For clarity, we use the subscript notation for partial derivatives (e.g., $c_t = \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}$, $c_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}$).\n\nTerm 1 (Forward difference in time):\n$$\n\\frac{c(x, t+\\Delta t) - c(x, t)}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\left[ \\left(c + \\Delta t c_t + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2} c_{tt} + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^3}{6} c_{ttt} + \\dots \\right) - c \\right] = c_t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} c_{tt} + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{6} c_{ttt} + O((\\Delta t)^3)\n$$\nTerm 2 (Centered difference in space for $c_x$):\n$$\nU \\frac{c(x+\\Delta x, t) - c(x-\\Delta x, t)}{2 \\Delta x} = \\frac{U}{2 \\Delta x} \\left[ \\left(c + \\Delta x c_x + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2} c_{xx} + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^3}{6} c_{xxx} + \\dots \\right) - \\left(c - \\Delta x c_x + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2} c_{xx} - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^3}{6} c_{xxx} + \\dots \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{U}{2 \\Delta x} \\left[ 2 \\Delta x c_x + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^3}{3} c_{xxx} + O((\\Delta x)^5) \\right] = U c_x + \\frac{U (\\Delta x)^2}{6} c_{xxx} + O((\\Delta x)^4)\n$$\nTerm 3 (Centered difference in space for $c_{xx}$):\n$$\n- \\frac{U^2 \\Delta t}{2} \\frac{c(x+\\Delta x, t) - 2c(x, t) + c(x-\\Delta x, t)}{(\\Delta x)^2} = - \\frac{U^2 \\Delta t}{2} \\left[ c_{xx} + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{12} c_{xxxx} + O((\\Delta x)^4) \\right] = - \\frac{U^2 \\Delta t}{2} c_{xx} - \\frac{U^2 \\Delta t (\\Delta x)^2}{24} c_{xxxx} + O(\\Delta t(\\Delta x)^4)\n$$\nCombining these expansions into the expression for $\\tau(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\tau(x,t) = \\left( c_t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} c_{tt} + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{6} c_{ttt} \\right) + \\left( U c_x + \\frac{U (\\Delta x)^2}{6} c_{xxx} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{U^2 \\Delta t}{2} c_{xx} \\right) + \\text{H.O.T.}\n$$\nWe group terms by their derivatives:\n$$\n\\tau(x,t) = (c_t + U c_x) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} (c_{tt} - U^2 c_{xx}) + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{6} c_{ttt} + \\frac{U (\\Delta x)^2}{6} c_{xxx} + \\text{H.O.T.}\n$$\nThe exact solution satisfies the governing equation $c_t + U c_x = 0$. This implies the scheme is *consistent*, as the leading term of $\\tau$ is not zeroth-order. Furthermore, we can use the governing equation to express higher-order time derivatives in terms of spatial derivatives:\n$c_{t} = -U c_{x}$\n$c_{tt} = \\partial_t(-U c_x) = -U c_{xt} = -U \\partial_x(c_t) = -U \\partial_x(-U c_x) = U^2 c_{xx}$\n$c_{ttt} = \\partial_t(U^2 c_{xx}) = U^2 c_{xxt} = U^2 \\partial_{xx}(-U c_x) = -U^3 c_{xxx}$\n\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $\\tau(x,t)$:\n1. The term $(c_t + U c_x)$ is $0$.\n2. The term $\\frac{\\Delta t}{2} (c_{tt} - U^2 c_{xx}) = \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} (U^2 c_{xx} - U^2 c_{xx})$ is also $0$. This cancellation is the hallmark of the Lax-Wendroff construction, elevating the scheme's accuracy.\n\nThe remaining leading-order terms are:\n$$\n\\tau(x,t) = \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{6} c_{ttt} + \\frac{U (\\Delta x)^2}{6} c_{xxx} + \\text{H.O.T.}\n$$\nSubstituting $c_{ttt} = -U^3 c_{xxx}$:\n$$\n\\tau(x,t) = \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{6} (-U^3 c_{xxx}) + \\frac{U (\\Delta x)^2}{6} c_{xxx} + \\text{H.O.T.}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau(x,t) = \\frac{U c_{xxx}}{6} \\left( (\\Delta x)^2 - U^2 (\\Delta t)^2 \\right) + \\text{H.O.T.}\n$$\nUsing the CFL number definition $\\lambda = \\frac{U \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$, we can write $\\Delta t = \\frac{\\lambda \\Delta x}{U}$. The expression becomes:\n$$\n\\tau(x,t) = \\frac{U c_{xxx}}{6} \\left( (\\Delta x)^2 - U^2 \\frac{\\lambda^2 (\\Delta x)^2}{U^2} \\right) + \\text{H.O.T.} = \\frac{U (\\Delta x)^2}{6} (1 - \\lambda^2) c_{xxx} + \\text{H.O.T.}\n$$\nThe primary error term also involves $(\\Delta t)^2$, so we can write $\\tau(x,t) = O((\\Delta x)^2, (\\Delta t)^2)$. Since the numerical experiment fixes $\\lambda$, $\\Delta t$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta x$. The overall order of accuracy is therefore second-order, and we expect the observed order $p$ to be $2$.\n\n### Task 2: Observed Order of Accuracy\n\nThe second task is to numerically verify the order of accuracy. This involves computing the truncation error on a sequence of grids and using the results to estimate the order of convergence $p$. The methodology is as follows:\n1.  For each test case $(U, k, L, \\lambda, \\{N_x\\})$, we iterate through the provided grid resolutions $N_x$.\n2.  For a given $N_x$, we define the grid parameters: grid spacing $\\Delta x = L / N_x$ and time step $\\Delta t = \\lambda \\Delta x / U$.\n3.  We define the spatial grid $x_i = i \\Delta x$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N_x-1$.\n4.  We evaluate the exact solution at time $t^n=0$ and $t^{n+1}=\\Delta t$:\n    $c(x_i, t^n) = \\sin(k x_i)$\n    $c(x_i, t^{n+1}) = \\sin(k x_i - \\omega \\Delta t)$, where $\\omega = U k$.\n5.  We compute the numerical solution at $t^{n+1}$, denoted $c_i^{n+1, \\text{num}}$, by applying the LW operator to the exact solution at $t^n$:\n    $c_i^{n+1, \\text{num}} = c(x_i,t^n) - \\frac{\\lambda}{2}(c(x_{i+1},t^n) - c(x_{i-1},t^n)) + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2}(c(x_{i+1},t^n) - 2c(x_i,t^n) + c(x_{i-1},t^n))$\n6.  The discrete residual is calculated as $R_i^n = c(x_i,t^{n+1}) - c_i^{n+1, \\text{num}}$.\n7.  The local truncation error at each grid point is $\\tau_i^n = R_i^n / \\Delta t$.\n8.  The magnitude of the error field is measured using the discrete $\\ell^2$ norm: $\\|\\tau\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\Delta x \\sum_{i=0}^{N_x-1} (\\tau_i^n)^2}$.\n9.  After computing $\\|\\tau\\|_2$ for the two finest grids (corresponding to grid spacings $\\Delta x_{\\text{fine}}$ and $\\Delta x_{\\text{finer}}$), the observed order $p$ is calculated using the formula:\n    $$\n    p \\approx \\frac{\\log\\left(\\|\\tau\\|_{2,\\text{fine}} / \\|\\tau\\|_{2,\\text{finer}}\\right)}{\\log\\left(\\Delta x_{\\text{fine}} / \\Delta x_{\\text{finer}}\\right)}\n    $$\nSince the resolutions in each test case are chosen such that $\\Delta x_{\\text{fine}} / \\Delta x_{\\text{finer}} = 2$, this simplifies to $p \\approx \\log_2(\\|\\tau\\|_{2,\\text{fine}} / \\|\\tau\\|_{2,\\text{finer}})$.

All provided equations, definitions, and assumptions are standard in the field of computational fluid dynamics and are internally consistent.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to derive the local truncation error of a semi-discrete finite volume scheme. The scheme is given by\n$$\n\\frac{d T_i}{d t} + \\mathcal{D}[T]_i = 0,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{D}[T]_i$ is the spatial discretization of the advection term $a \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$.

The Van Leer limiter is $\\varphi(r) = \\frac{r + |r|}{1 + |r|}$.\n\nThe analysis is performed by inserting the exact smooth solution $T(x,t)$ into the discrete operator and applying Taylor series expansions around the point $x_i$ at a fixed time $t$. We will use the notation $T^{(n)}$ to denote $\\frac{\\partial^n T}{\\partial x^n}(x_i)$.\n\n**Part 1: Truncation Error in a Smooth Region**\n\nIn this part, we assume the solution is smooth and monotonically increasing, which implies $r_i \\ge 0$ and $r_i \\to 1$ as $h \\to 0$.

To find the second-order error term, we need a more accurate expansion of $r_i$ and subsequently $\\varphi(r_i)$.\nLet $r_i = 1+\\delta$.

The problem states this corresponds to the case $\\varphi(r) \\to 0$. For the Van Leer limiter, $\\varphi(r) = \\frac{2r}{1+r}$ (for $r \\ge 0$) approaches $0$ as $r \\to 0$. The condition $r_i = \\frac{T_i - T_{i-1}}{T_{i+1} - T_i} \\to 0$ implies that the gradient is increasing sharply at $x_i$, i.e., $T_i - T_{i-1} \\ll T_{i+1} - T_i$.\n\nUnder this condition, the reconstruction formula becomes\n$$\nT_{i+1/2}^{L} = T_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\varphi(r_i)\\left(T_i - T_{i-1}\\right) \\to T_i \\quad \\text{as } \\varphi(r_i) \\to 0.\n$$\nFor the flux at the west face, $T_{i-1/2}^L$, we evaluate the formula at index $i-1$.\n$$\nT_{i-1/2}^{L} = T_{i-1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\varphi(r_{i-1})\\left(T_{i-1} - T_{i-2}\\right).\n$$\nIf the gradient is steep over several cells, it is likely that $r_{i-1}$ is also small, causing $\\varphi(r_{i-1}) \\to 0$. In this case, $T_{i-1/2}^{L} \\to T_{i-1}$.\nThe spatial operator then reduces to\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}[T]_i = \\frac{a T_{i} - a T_{i-1}}{h} = \\frac{a}{h}(T_i - T_{i-1}).\n$$\nThis is the spatial operator for the first-order upwind scheme. To find its truncation error, we expand $T_{i-1}$ about $x_i$:\n$$\nT_{i-1} = T_i - h T^{(1)} + \\frac{h^2}{2} T^{(2)} + \\mathcal{O}(h^3).\n$$\nSubstituting this into the operator:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}[T]_i = \\frac{a}{h} \\left( T_i - \\left(T_i - h T^{(1)} + \\frac{h^2}{2} T^{(2)} - \\dots \\right) \\right) = \\frac{a}{h} \\left( h T^{(1)} - \\frac{h^2}{2} T^{(2)} + \\dots \\right) = a T^{(1)} - \\frac{a h}{2} T^{(2)} + \\mathcal{O}(h^2).\n$$\nThe leading-order truncation error is\n$$\n\\tau_i = \\mathcal{D}[T]_i - a T^{(1)} = - \\frac{a h}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^2).\n$$\nThis term is of order $h$, so the scheme's formal order of accuracy is reduced to first order. This leading error term is known as numerical diffusion.\n\n**Explanation of Reduced Accuracy and Consistency**\n\nThe analysis demonstrates that the MUSCL scheme with the Van Leer limiter exhibits a remarkable property: its order of accuracy is not uniform. In smooth regions of the solution, it is a second-order accurate scheme, while near steep gradients, it locally reverts to a first-order accurate scheme.\n\nThis behavior is not a flaw but a crucial design feature. Godunov's theorem proves that any linear numerical scheme for advection with an order of accuracy greater than one cannot guarantee that monotonic initial data will remain monotonic (i.e., it will produce spurious oscillations near sharp features). High-resolution schemes like MUSCL circumvent this limitation by being non-linear. The non-linearity is introduced by the flux limiter function $\\varphi(r_i)$, which makes the scheme's coefficients depend on the solution itself.\n\nThe limiter's role is to sense steep gradients (where $r_i$ deviates significantly from $1$) and, in those regions, to reduce the \"anti-diffusive\" flux terms that provide high accuracy, effectively adding numerical diffusion. This controlled addition of diffusion suppresses the oscillations that a higher-order linear scheme would produce, ensuring a stable and physically plausible solution. The trade-off is a local reduction in the formal order of accuracy from second to first.\n\nDespite this local reduction in accuracy, the scheme remains **consistent**. A scheme is consistent if its truncation error $\\tau_i$ approaches zero as the grid spacing $h \\to 0$. In the smooth case, $\\tau_i = \\mathcal{O}(h^2)$, which goes to zero. In the steep gradient case, $\\tau_i = \\mathcal{O}(h)$, which also goes to zero. Since the truncation error vanishes in the limit of grid refinement everywhere in the domain, the discretized equation converges to the original partial differential equation. The *rate* of convergence is simply slower in some regions than in others. This adaptive, non-linear mechanism is the foundation of modern shock-capturing methods, which aim to be highly accurate in smooth regions while remaining robust and non-oscillatory at discontinuities.",
