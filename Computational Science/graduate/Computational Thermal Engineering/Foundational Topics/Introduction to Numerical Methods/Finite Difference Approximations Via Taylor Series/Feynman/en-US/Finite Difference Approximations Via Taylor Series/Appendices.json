Consequently, a sufficient stability condition is\n$$\n\\Delta t \\leq \\frac{2}{|\\lambda_{\\min}|},\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_{\\min}  0$ is the most negative eigenvalue of $\\alpha L$. To bound $|\\lambda_{\\min}|$ on the nonuniform grid, we use a Gershgorin-type bound based on the local tri-diagonal stencil coefficients at $x_{0}$. The discrete operator $L$ at $x_{0}$ has row coefficients\n$$\nL_{0,-1} = a = \\frac{2}{h_{1}(h_{1}+h_{2})}, \\quad L_{0,0} = b = -\\frac{2}{h_{1} h_{2}}, \\quad L_{0,+1} = c = \\frac{2}{h_{2}(h_{1}+h_{2})}.\n$$\nThe Gershgorin disc for this row is centered at $b$ with radius $R = a + c$, which evaluates to\n$$\nR = \\frac{2}{h_{1}(h_{1}+h_{2})} + \\frac{2}{h_{2}(h_{1}+h_{2})} = \\frac{2}{h_{1} h_{2}}.\n$$\nTherefore, the local eigenvalues of $L$ are contained in the interval $[b - R, b + R] = \\left[-\\frac{4}{h_{1} h_{2}}, 0 \\right]$. Multiplying by $\\alpha$ yields eigenvalues of $\\alpha L$ in $\\left[ -\\frac{4 \\alpha}{h_{1} h_{2}}, 0 \\right]$, so a sufficient bound is $|\\lambda_{\\min}| \\leq \\frac{4 \\alpha}{h_{1} h_{2}}$. Applying the forward Euler stability criterion gives\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{4 \\alpha}{h_{1} h_{2}}} = \\frac{h_{1} h_{2}}{2 \\alpha}.\n$$\nThis bound also coincides with the requirement that the self-weight in the FTCS update remain nonnegative:\n$$\n1 + \\alpha \\Delta t\\, b \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow 1 - \\frac{2 \\alpha \\Delta t}{h_{1} h_{2}} \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow \\Delta t \\leq \\frac{h_{1} h_{2}}{2 \\alpha}.\n$$\nThus, the largest stable explicit time step dictated by the local nonuniform three-point stencil at $x_{0}$ is\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{h_{1} h_{2}}{2 \\alpha}.\n$$",
