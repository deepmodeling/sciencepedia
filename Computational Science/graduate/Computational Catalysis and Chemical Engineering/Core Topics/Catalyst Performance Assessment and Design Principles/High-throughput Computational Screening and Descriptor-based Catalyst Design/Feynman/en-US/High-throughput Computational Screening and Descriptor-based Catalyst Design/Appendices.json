            "problem": "In a descriptor-based, high-throughput computational screening workflow for heterogeneous catalysts, an elementary step along a reaction network is modeled using the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relation, a well-tested linear correlation between the activation barrier and the reaction energy within a mechanistically consistent reaction family. Assume that for this reaction family, the activation barrier is an affine function of the reaction energy whose slope equals the Brønsted coefficient and whose intercept equals the barrier at thermoneutrality. Specifically, let the slope be the Brønsted coefficient $\\alpha$ and the intercept at thermoneutrality be $E_{0}$, both obtained from a regression on a calibrated training set of catalysts. A candidate material has a reaction energy $\\Delta E$ predicted by a descriptor model derived from adsorption-energy scaling relations. The screening pipeline enforces the physical constraint that activation barriers cannot be negative.\n\nGiven $\\alpha = 0.5$, $E_{0} = 0.2$ eV, and $\\Delta E = -0.4$ eV for this candidate, compute the activation barrier $E_{a}$ predicted by the BEP relation and the non-negativity constraint. Express your answer in electronvolts (eV).",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated for scientific soundness, clarity, and completeness.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The relationship between activation barrier, $E_a$, and reaction energy, $\\Delta E$, is the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relation.\n- The BEP relation is modeled as an affine function.\n- The slope of the function is the Brønsted coefficient, $\\alpha$.\n- The intercept at thermoneutrality ($\\Delta E = 0$) is $E_0$.\n- A physical constraint is imposed: activation barriers cannot be negative, i.e., $E_a \\ge 0$.\n- Given value for the Brønsted coefficient: $\\alpha = 0.5$.\n- Given value for the barrier at thermoneutrality: $E_0 = 0.2$ eV.\n- Given value for the reaction energy of a candidate material: $\\Delta E = -0.4$ eV.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relation is a fundamental concept in chemical kinetics and catalysis, often expressed as a linear or affine relationship between activation energies and reaction energies for a family of related reactions. The parameters $\\alpha$ and $E_0$ are standard in this context. The values provided ($\\alpha = 0.5$, $E_0 = 0.2$ eV, $\\Delta E = -0.4$ eV) are physically realistic for elementary steps in heterogeneous catalysis. The constraint that an activation barrier must be non-negative is a fundamental physical requirement. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with all necessary information provided to compute a unique solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem states that the activation barrier, $E_a$, is an affine function of the reaction energy, $\\Delta E$. An affine function takes the general form $f(x) = mx + c$. In this context, we can write:\n$$E_a(\\Delta E) = m \\cdot \\Delta E + c$$\nThe problem identifies the slope, $m$, as the Brønsted coefficient, $\\alpha$. Therefore:\n$$E_a(\\Delta E) = \\alpha \\cdot \\Delta E + c$$\nThe constant $c$ is determined from the intercept condition. The problem specifies that the intercept at thermoneutrality is $E_0$. Thermoneutrality corresponds to a reaction energy of zero, $\\Delta E = 0$. At this point, the activation barrier is given as $E_0$. Substituting these conditions into the equation:\n$$E_a(0) = \\alpha \\cdot (0) + c = E_0$$\nThis directly implies that the constant $c$ is equal to $E_0$. Thus, the specific form of the BEP relation for this reaction family is:\n$$E_a = \\alpha \\cdot \\Delta E + E_0$$\nThis equation gives the activation barrier as calculated from the linear correlation.\n\nNext, we must apply the physical constraint that activation barriers cannot be negative. This means the predicted activation barrier, which we will denote as $E_a^{\\text{pred}}$, must be greater than or equal to zero. If the BEP relation yields a negative value, it is an artifact of the linear model being applied outside its region of validity, and the barrier should be set to zero, which represents a barrierless process. This can be expressed mathematically using the maximum function:\n$$E_a^{\\text{pred}} = \\max(0, \\alpha \\cdot \\Delta E + E_0)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- $\\alpha = 0.5$\n- $E_0 = 0.2$ eV\n- $\\Delta E = -0.4$ eV\n\nFirst, we compute the value of the term inside the maximum function:\n$$\\alpha \\cdot \\Delta E + E_0 = (0.5) \\cdot (-0.4) + 0.2$$\n$$= -0.2 + 0.2$$\n$$= 0$$\nThe units of this result are electronvolts (eV), as both $E_0$ and $\\Delta E$ are in eV and $\\alpha$ is dimensionless.\n\nFinally, we apply the non-negativity constraint to find the predicted activation barrier:\n$$E_a^{\\text{pred}} = \\max(0, 0)$$\n$$E_a^{\\text{pred}} = 0$$\nThe predicted activation barrier for the candidate material is $0$ eV.",
