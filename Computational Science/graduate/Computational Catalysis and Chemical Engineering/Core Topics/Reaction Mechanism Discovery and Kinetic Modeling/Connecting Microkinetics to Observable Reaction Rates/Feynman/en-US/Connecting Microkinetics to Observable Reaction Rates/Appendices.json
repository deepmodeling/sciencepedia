A complete solution will now be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins by applying the Steady-State Approximation (SSA) to the sole surface intermediate, $A*$. The SSA posits that the net rate of formation of a reactive intermediate is zero. For $A*$, its formation occurs via the adsorption step (rate $r_{1}$), and its consumption occurs via the desorption step (rate $r_{-1}$) and the surface reaction step (rate $r_{2}$).\n\nThe SSA balance on the surface concentration (or coverage) of $A*$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_{A}}{dt} = (\\text{rate of formation of } A*) - (\\text{rate of consumption of } A*) = 0\n$$\n$$\nr_{1} - r_{-1} - r_{2} = 0\n$$\nThis implies that at steady state, the rate of formation equals the rate of consumption:\n$$\nr_{1} = r_{-1} + r_{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given rate expressions into this equation yields:\n$$\nk_{1} P_{A} \\theta_{*} = k_{-1} \\theta_{A} + k_{2} P_{B} \\theta_{A}\n$$\nThis equation contains two unknown coverages, $\\theta_{A}$ and $\\theta_{*}$. To solve for one of them, we use the site balance constraint, which states that the sum of the fractional coverages of all species on the surface (vacant sites $*$ and adsorbed intermediate $A*$) must equal $1$.\n$$\n\\theta_{*} + \\theta_{A} = 1\n$$\nFrom the site balance, we express the vacant site coverage $\\theta_{*}$ in terms of the intermediate coverage $\\theta_{A}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{*} = 1 - \\theta_{A}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\theta_{*}$ into the steady-state equation gives an equation solely in terms of $\\theta_{A}$:\n$$\nk_{1} P_{A} (1 - \\theta_{A}) = k_{-1} \\theta_{A} + k_{2} P_{B} \\theta_{A}\n$$\nThe next step is to solve this equation algebraically for $\\theta_{A}$. First, we expand the left-hand side and factor $\\theta_{A}$ on the right-hand side:\n$$\nk_{1} P_{A} - k_{1} P_{A} \\theta_{A} = (k_{-1} + k_{2} P_{B}) \\theta_{A}\n$$\nNow, we collect all terms containing $\\theta_{A}$ onto one side of the equation:\n$$\nk_{1} P_{A} = k_{1} P_{A} \\theta_{A} + (k_{-1} + k_{2} P_{B}) \\theta_{A}\n$$\nFactoring out $\\theta_{A}$ yields:\n$$\nk_{1} P_{A} = (k_{1} P_{A} + k_{-1} + k_{2} P_{B}) \\theta_{A}\n$$\nIsolating $\\theta_{A}$ provides the analytical expression for the steady-state coverage of the intermediate $A*$:\n$$\n\\theta_{A} = \\frac{k_{1} P_{A}}{k_{-1} + k_{1} P_{A} + k_{2} P_{B}}\n$$\nThe problem defines the observable rate of product formation per active site, $r_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, as being equal to the rate of the third elementary step, $r_{2}$.\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{obs}} = r_{2} = k_{2} P_{B} \\theta_{A}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the derived expression for $\\theta_{A}$ into the equation for $r_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ to obtain the final rate expression as a function of partial pressures and kinetic parameters:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{obs}} = k_{2} P_{B} \\left( \\frac{k_{1} P_{A}}{k_{-1} + k_{1} P_{A} + k_{2} P_{B}} \\right)\n$$\nCombining the terms gives the final rational function for the observable rate:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{k_{1} k_{2} P_{A} P_{B}}{k_{-1} + k_{1} P_{A} + k_{2} P_{B}}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the rate of reaction per site, derived from first principles as required.",

Often, this is the step with the highest activation energy barrier, especially if pre-exponential factors are similar. Here, $A_2 = A_3$, and $E_3 (95\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}) > E_2 (90\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}})$. Thus, a simple RDS approximation would identify step (3) as the RDS.\n\nIf step (3) were the sole rate-determining step, it would imply $X_3 = 1$ and all other DRC coefficients for rate constants would be $0$ (so $X_2 = 0$). In this scenario, the apparent activation energy of the reaction, $E_{app}$, would be dominated by the activation energy of the RDS. Ignoring the contribution from the enthalpy of adsorption (which is common in this type of simplified analysis), the RDS approximation predicts $E_{app}^{RDS} \\approx E_3 = 95\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\nThe Degree of Rate Control concept provides a more quantitative picture. The contribution of the elementary-step activation barriers to the overall apparent activation energy is given by the weighted sum:\n$$E_{app, barriers} = X_2 E_2 + X_3 E_3$$\nUsing our calculated DRC values:\n$$E_{app, barriers} \\approx (0.38)(90\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}) + (0.62)(95\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}})$$\n$$E_{app, barriers} \\approx 34.2\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} + 58.9\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 93.1\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nThe value is stated as $\\approx 93\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ in option A.\n\nThe DRC analysis shows that while step (3) is more rate-controlling ($X_3 = 0.62$), step (2) is also kinetically significant ($X_2 = 0.38$). The RDS approximation, by assigning full control to step (3) ($X_3 = 1$), predicts an apparent activation energy of $95\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. The more accurate DRC-based value is $\\approx 93.1\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. Therefore, the RDS approximation overestimates the apparent activation energy because it incorrectly assumes one step is completely dominant.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\nA. $X_2 \\approx 0.38$, $X_3 \\approx 0.62$; the DRC predicts an apparent activation energy that is a weighted average of $E_2$ and $E_3$ (here $\\approx 93\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$), which is smaller than the larger barrier $E_3$, so the RDS approximation overestimates it by assigning full control to step $(3)$.\nThis option's DRC values match our calculation. The calculation of the weighted-average activation energy is correct ($\\approx 93.1\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$). The comparison with the RDS approximation is also correct: the RDS would predict $E_3=95\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, which is an overestimation. The reasoning is sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. $X_2 \\approx 0.50$, $X_3 \\approx 0.50$; both steps share control equally, so both the DRC and the RDS give an identical apparent activation energy equal to the average of $E_2$ and $E_3$.\nThe DRC coefficients are not $0.50$. The control is not shared equally. The RDS approximation would not give an average, but would select a single step.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. $X_2 \\approx 1.00$, $X_3 \\approx 0.00$; the lower-barrier step $(2)$ fully determines the rate due to upstream control, so the DRC and the RDS both predict the apparent activation energy $\\approx E_2$.\nThe DRC coefficients are not $1.00$ and $0.00$. Step (2) does not have full control.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $X_2 \\approx 0.00$, $X_3 \\approx 1.00$; the higher-barrier step $(3)$ fully determines the rate, so the DRC and the RDS exactly agree on the apparent activation energy $\\approx E_3$, and step $(2)$ is kinetically irrelevant.\nThe DRC coefficients are not $0.00$ and $1.00$. This option describes the RDS approximation, but incorrectly claims the DRC analysis agrees with it. Our DRC calculation shows that step (2) is kinetically relevant ($X_2 \\approx 0.38$). Therefore, the DRC and RDS approximations do not agree.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

            "introduction": "Beyond the steady-state rate, the dynamic behavior of a catalytic system provides crucial insights into its operation. This exercise  explores the local stability of a reaction network by linearizing the governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) at a steady state. By computing the eigenvalues of the resulting Jacobian matrix, you will characterize the system's response to small perturbations and identify the intrinsic timescales of surface relaxation, a key to understanding phenomena from catalyst response to kinetic oscillations.",

            "problem": "Consider a single-site catalytic surface with three mutually exclusive site states: vacant site $*$, adsorbed intermediate $A*$, and adsorbed intermediate $B*$. The site fractions (coverages) are $\\theta_{*}$, $\\theta_{A}$, and $\\theta_{B}$, respectively, and satisfy the site balance $\\theta_{*} + \\theta_{A} + \\theta_{B} = 1$. The gas-phase species $A$ and $B$ competitively adsorb on $*$, and react via a bimolecular Langmuir–Hinshelwood surface reaction to form products and free sites. The elementary steps are:\n- $A(\\mathrm{g}) + * \\rightleftharpoons A*$ with forward (adsorption) pseudo-first-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{a},A} p_{A}$ and reverse (desorption) rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{d},A}$,\n- $B(\\mathrm{g}) + * \\rightleftharpoons B*$ with forward (adsorption) pseudo-first-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{a},B} p_{B}$ and reverse (desorption) rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{d},B}$,\n- $A* + B* \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Products} + * + *$ with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{r}}$.\n\nAssume isothermal, isobaric operation with constant partial pressures $p_{A}$ and $p_{B}$, and use mass-action kinetics. Let the state vector be $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\theta_{A}, \\theta_{B})^{\\top}$, and the Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) for the coverages be determined by the net formation rates of $A*$ and $B*$. The observable macroscopic production rate of products per site (in molecules per site per second) is proportional to the surface reaction rate $r_{\\mathrm{prod}} = k_{\\mathrm{r}} \\theta_{A} \\theta_{B}$; its small-signal dynamics are governed by the same linearization used for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$.\n\nUnder the symmetric conditions $k_{\\mathrm{a},A} p_{A} = k_{\\mathrm{a},B} p_{B} \\equiv K$, $k_{\\mathrm{d},A} = k_{\\mathrm{d},B} \\equiv D$, and $k_{\\mathrm{r}} \\equiv R$, with numerical values $K = 1.0$ s$^{-1}$, $D = 0.5$ s$^{-1}$, and $R = 2.0$ s$^{-1}$, perform the following:\n\n1. Starting from the site balance and mass-action expressions for the elementary steps, write the ODEs for $\\theta_{A}(t)$ and $\\theta_{B}(t)$ in terms of $K$, $D$, $R$, and $\\theta_{*} = 1 - \\theta_{A} - \\theta_{B}$.\n\n2. Determine the physically admissible steady state with $\\theta_{A} = \\theta_{B}$ and $0 < \\theta_{A}, \\theta_{B} < 1$.\n\n3. Linearize the ODEs at this steady state, compute the Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$, and then compute the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{J}$. Use the signs of the eigenvalues to assess local stability, and interpret their magnitudes in terms of relaxation times for small perturbations in $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ and the observable rate $r_{\\mathrm{prod}}$.\n\nReport only the two Jacobian eigenvalues in s$^{-1}$, rounded to four significant figures. Express your final answer as the pair of eigenvalues.",

Adsorption of $A$: $r_{\\mathrm{a},A} = k_{\\mathrm{a},A} p_{A} \\theta_{*}$\n2.  Desorption of $A$: $r_{\\mathrm{d},A} = k_{\\mathrm{d},A} \\theta_{A}$\n3.

From the quadratic equation for $\\theta_s$, we have $2R\\theta_s = -(2K+D) + \\sqrt{(2K+D)^2 + 4RK}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\lambda_{2}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{2} = -(2K+D) - \\left( -(2K+D) + \\sqrt{(2K+D)^2 + 4RK} \\right) = - \\sqrt{(2K+D)^2 + 4RK}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1} = -D = -0.5 \\text{ s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{2} = - \\sqrt{(2(1.0)+0.5)^2 + 4(2.0)(1.0)} = - \\sqrt{(2.5)^2 + 8.0} = - \\sqrt{14.25} \\approx -3.774917... \\text{ s}^{-1}\n$$\nBoth eigenvalues are real and negative, which indicates that the steady state is a stable node. Any small perturbation will decay exponentially back to this state. The magnitudes of the eigenvalues determine the relaxation rates. The associated relaxation times are $\\tau_i = -1/\\lambda_i$.\n$$\n\\tau_1 = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda_1} = -\\frac{1}{-0.5} = 2.0 \\text{ s}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_2 = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda_2} = -\\frac{1}{-3.7749...} \\approx 0.2649 \\text{ s}\n$$\nThese represent a slow and a fast timescale for the system's return to equilibrium, respectively. The dynamics of the observable rate $r_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ are also governed by these same timescales.\n\nRounding the eigenvalues to four significant figures as required:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1} = -0.5000 \\text{ s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{2} = -3.775 \\text{ s}^{-1}\n$$",
