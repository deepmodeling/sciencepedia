The problem states that we should neglect vibrational, electronic, and zero-point energy contributions. This means we set $q_{vib}=1$, $q_{elec}=1$, and $\\Delta E_0=0$. The equilibrium constant thus simplifies to a product of translational and rotational contributions, $K = K_{trans} K_{rot}$.

For a diatomic molecule with atomic masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, the reduced mass is $\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$.

The phenomena described—lifting of orbital degeneracy upon adsorption on a surface, hybridization with metal $d$-bands, and spin quenching through exchange coupling—are standard and well-documented concepts. The energy scales ($\\Delta = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) and temperature ($T=600\\,\\mathrm{K}$) are physically realistic for such systems.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear description of the electronic energy level structure of the adsorbed species, which is the necessary and sufficient information to construct the electronic partition function. The question is specific and has a unique, calculable answer.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (Scientific Unsoundness, Non-Formalizable, Incomplete/Contradictory, Unrealistic, Ill-Posed, Pseudo-Profound, or Unverifiable). The context of the gas-phase properties serves to highlight the changes upon adsorption, which is central to the problem's conceptual challenge, rather than creating a contradiction.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe electronic partition function, $q_{elec}$, is defined by the sum over all electronic states, weighted by their Boltzmann factors:\n$$\nq_{elec} = \\sum_{i} g_i e^{-\\epsilon_i / (k_B T)}\n$$\nwhere $i$ indexes the electronic energy levels, $\\epsilon_i$ is the energy of level $i$ relative to the ground state, $g_i$ is the degeneracy of level $i$, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nWe must construct this sum for the **adsorbed molecule**, using the properties specified in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Energy Levels**: The problem states that adsorption lifts the orbital degeneracy, resulting in two sublevels. We can set the energy of the lower sublevel (the ground state) to zero for the purpose of calculating the partition function.\n    - Ground state energy: $\\epsilon_0 = 0$.\n    - First excited state energy: $\\epsilon_1 = \\Delta = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n    The problem also states that other electronic excitations are above $1\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Let's evaluate the thermal energy scale:\n    $$\n    k_B T = (8.617\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (600\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.0517\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n    $$\n    For an excitation at $E_{ex} \\ge 1\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, the Boltzmann factor would be $e^{-E_{ex}/(k_B T)} \\le e^{-1/0.0517} \\approx e^{-19.3} \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-9}$. This value is negligible, so the assumption to neglect these higher states is justified. We only need to consider the two levels originating from the split $\\pi$ orbital.\n\n2.  **Degeneracies**: The degeneracy of each level, $g_i$, is the product of its orbital degeneracy and spin degeneracy ($g_i = g_{orb,i} \\times g_{spin,i}$).\n    - **Orbital degeneracy**: The problem states that the two sublevels are \"nondegenerate\". This means the orbital degeneracy for each level is $1$. So, $g_{orb,0} = 1$ and $g_{orb,1} = 1$.\n    - **Spin degeneracy**: The problem explicitly states that \"strong exchange coupling with the substrate quenches the spin, yielding a singlet-like ground state consistent with $S=0$\". The spin multiplicity is $2S+1$. For $S=0$, the spin multiplicity is $2(0)+1 = 1$. This quenching applies to the bound electronic configuration. Therefore, the spin degeneracy for both the ground and first excited electronic states is $1$. So, $g_{spin,0} = 1$ and $g_{spin,1} = 1$.\n    - **Total degeneracy**:\n        - For the ground state: $g_0 = g_{orb,0} \\times g_{spin,0} = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n        - For the first excited state: $g_1 = g_{orb,1} \\times g_{spin,1} = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\n3.  **Constructing $q_{elec}$**: Using these energies and degeneracies, we can write the partition function:\n    $$\n    q_{elec} = g_0 e^{-\\epsilon_0 / (k_B T)} + g_1 e^{-\\epsilon_1 / (k_B T)}\n    $$\n    $$\n    q_{elec} = (1) e^{-0 / (k_B T)} + (1) e^{-\\Delta / (k_B T)}\n    $$\n    $$\n    q_{elec} = 1 + e^{-\\Delta / (k_B T)}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation**: We now substitute the given values:\n    - $\\Delta = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n    - $k_B T \\approx 0.0517\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n    The exponent is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\Delta}{k_B T} = \\frac{0.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{8.617\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}} \\times 600\\,\\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{0.05}{0.051702} \\approx 0.96708\n    $$\n    Now, we calculate the partition function:\n    $$\n    q_{elec} = 1 + e^{-0.96708} \\approx 1 + 0.38018 \\approx 1.38018\n    $$\n    Rounding to two decimal places, $q_{elec} \\approx 1.38$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $q_{elec}=4$, independent of $T$, equal to the gas-phase ground-state electronic degeneracy.**\nThis option incorrectly uses the properties of the gas-phase molecule. In the gas phase, the ground state has a $2$-fold orbital degeneracy (from the $\\pi$ orbital) and a $2$-fold spin degeneracy (from $S=1/2$), giving a total degeneracy of $2 \\times 2 = 4$. However, the partition function must be calculated for the adsorbate, whose electronic structure is profoundly altered by the surface interaction, as described in the problem (degeneracy lifting and spin quenching).\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. $q_{elec}=1$, because adsorption fully quenches all electronic degeneracy and electronic excited states are inaccessible at moderate $T$.**\nThis option correctly recognizes that the ground state of the adsorbate is non-degenerate ($g_0=1$). However, it incorrectly dismisses the contribution from the first excited state. The energy of this state, $\\Delta=0.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, is very close to the thermal energy, $k_B T \\approx 0.0517\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Since $\\Delta \\approx k_B T$, the Boltzmann factor $e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)}$ is not negligible ($e^{-1} \\approx 0.37$). The excited state is thermally accessible and must be included in the partition function.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $q_{elec}=1+e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)}\\approx 1.38$, counting contributions from the split orbital sublevels while spin multiplicity is quenched.**\nThis expression correctly represents the partition function for a two-level system where both levels are non-degenerate ($g=1$). The term '$1$' corresponds to the ground state, and the term '$e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)}$' corresponds to the excited state at energy $\\Delta$. This accurately reflects the described physics: two non-degenerate orbital states resulting from the lifted degeneracy, and a spin multiplicity of $1$ (singlet state) for both. The numerical calculation is also consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**D. $q_{elec}=\\displaystyle \\int dE\\, f_{FD}(E,\\mu,T)\\,\\rho_{metal}(E)$, where $f_{FD}$ is the Fermi–Dirac (FD) distribution, $\\mu$ is the electron chemical potential, and $\\rho_{metal}(E)$ is the metal’s electronic density of states.**\nThis expression describes a property of the electron gas within the metal substrate, not the discrete electronic states of the localized adsorbate molecule. The problem asks for the molecular partition function of the adsorbate. While the metal's electronic structure (the substrate) causes the changes in the adsorbate's states, this integral does not represent the adsorbate's partition function, which is a sum over its discrete states.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $q_{elec}=2+2\\,e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)}\\approx 2.76$, retaining the original spin multiplicity and orbital degeneracy after adsorption.**\nThis expression can be written as $2(1 + e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)})$. The term in parentheses correctly accounts for the two orbital levels split by energy $\\Delta$. The pre-factor of $2$ implies that each of these levels has a degeneracy of $2$. This would be the case if the spin state remained a doublet ($S=1/2$, multiplicity $2S+1=2$). However, the problem explicitly states that the spin is quenched to a singlet state ($S=0$, multiplicity $1$). This option ignores the crucial information about spin quenching.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

Scale the result to obtain the derivative of the standard molar entropy.\n\nThe total vibrational partition function for one molecule, $Z_{vib}$, is the product of the partition functions for each independent normal mode, $z_i$.\n$$ Z_{vib} = \\prod_{i=1}^{f} z_i $$\nThe total Helmholtz free energy, $A_{vib}$, is the sum of the contributions from each mode, $a_i$.\n$$ A_{vib} = \\sum_{i=1}^{f} a_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{f} (-k_B T \\ln z_i) $$\nSimilarly, the total vibrational entropy for one molecule, $S_{vib}$, is the sum of the entropy contributions from each mode, $s_i$.\n$$ S_{vib} = \\sum_{i=1}^{f} s_i $$\nThe problem asks for $\\frac{\\partial S^\\circ(T)}{\\partial \\omega_i}$. Given that other contributions to entropy are independent of $\\omega_i$ and the vibrational modes are independent, this simplifies to calculating the derivative of the contribution from mode $i$ only, and then scaling it for one mole.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial S^\\circ(T)}{\\partial \\omega_i} = \\frac{\\partial S_{vib}^\\circ(T)}{\\partial \\omega_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\omega_i} \\left( N_A \\sum_{j=1}^{f} s_j \\right) = N_A \\frac{\\partial s_i}{\\partial \\omega_i} $$\nwhere $s_i$ is the entropy of a single oscillator with frequency $\\omega_i$ and $N_A$ is Avogadro's number.\n\n**Step 2.1: Partition Function of a Single Vibrational Mode ($z_i$)**\nThe energy levels for a single quantum harmonic oscillator of frequency $\\omega_i$ are given by $\\varepsilon_{n,i} = \\hbar \\omega_i (n + 1/2)$, where $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The partition function $z_i$ for this mode is the sum over all its quantum states:\n$$ z_i = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta \\varepsilon_{n,i}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) $$\nWe can factor out the zero-point energy term:\n$$ z_i = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i}{2}\\right) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i n) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i}{2}\\right) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left[\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i)\\right]^n $$\nThe summation is a geometric series $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} r^k = \\frac{1}{1-r}$ with $r = \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i)$. Since $\\beta, \\hbar, \\omega_i > 0$, we have $0  r  1$.\n$$ z_i = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i}{2}\\right) \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i)} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i / 2)}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i)} $$\n\n**Step 2.2: Helmholtz Free Energy of a Single Mode ($a_i$)**\nThe Helmholtz free energy contribution from this mode is $a_i = -k_B T \\ln z_i$.\n$$ a_i = -k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i / 2)}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i)}\\right) $$\nUsing logarithm properties, $\\ln(x/y) = \\ln(x) - \\ln(y)$:\n$$ a_i = -k_B T \\left[ \\ln(\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i / 2)) - \\ln(1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i)) \\right] $$\n$$ a_i = -k_B T \\left[ -\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i}{2} - \\ln(1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_i)) \\right] $$\nSubstituting $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$$ a_i = -k_B T \\left[ -\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{2 k_B T} - \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ a_i = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{2} + k_B T \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) $$\n\n**Step 2.3: Entropy of a Single Mode ($s_i$)**\nThe entropy contribution is $s_i = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial a_i}{\\partial T}\\right)_{\\omega_i}$.\n$$ s_i = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left[ \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{2} + k_B T \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) \\right] $$\nThe first term $\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{2}$ is the zero-point energy and is independent of $T$, so its derivative is zero. We apply the product rule to the second term:\n$$ s_i = - \\left[ k_B \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) + k_B T \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) \\right] $$\nLet's compute the derivative of the logarithm term using the chain rule. Let $u = -\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}$. Then $\\frac{du}{dT} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T^2}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\ln(1 - \\exp(u)) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(u)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}(1-\\exp(u)) = \\frac{-\\exp(u)}{1 - \\exp(u)} \\frac{du}{dT} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T^2}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $s_i$:\n$$ s_i = - k_B \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) - k_B T \\left[ \\frac{-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T^2} \\right] $$\n$$ s_i = - k_B \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) + \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{T} \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)$:\n$$ s_i = k_B \\left[\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right) - 1} - \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)\\right] $$\n\n**Step 2.4: Derivative of Entropy with Respect to Frequency ($\\frac{\\partial s_i}{\\partial \\omega_i}$)**\nWe now differentiate $s_i$ with respect to $\\omega_i$, holding $T$ constant. Let $x = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}$ to simplify the notation. Then $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\omega_i} = \\frac{\\hbar}{k_B T}$. The expression for $s_i$ becomes:\n$$ s_i = k_B \\left[ \\frac{x}{\\exp(x) - 1} - \\ln(1 - \\exp(-x)) \\right] $$\nWe use the chain rule: $\\frac{\\partial s_i}{\\partial \\omega_i} = \\frac{\\partial s_i}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\omega_i}$.\nFirst, we find $\\frac{\\partial s_i}{\\partial x}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial s_i}{\\partial x} = k_B \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ \\frac{x}{\\exp(x) - 1} - \\ln(1 - \\exp(-x)) \\right] $$\nDifferentiating term by term:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\exp(x) - 1}\\right) = \\frac{1 \\cdot (\\exp(x)-1) - x \\cdot \\exp(x)}{(\\exp(x)-1)^2} = \\frac{\\exp(x) - 1 - x\\exp(x)}{(\\exp(x)-1)^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-\\ln(1 - \\exp(-x))\\right) = - \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-x)} \\cdot (-(-\\exp(-x))) = - \\frac{\\exp(-x)}{1 - \\exp(-x)} = - \\frac{1}{\\exp(x) - 1} $$\nCombining these results:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial s_i}{\\partial x} = k_B \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(x) - 1 - x\\exp(x)}{(\\exp(x)-1)^2} - \\frac{1}{\\exp(x) - 1} \\right] $$\nPutting the terms over a common denominator:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial s_i}{\\partial x} = k_B \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(x) - 1 - x\\exp(x) - (\\exp(x) - 1)}{(\\exp(x) - 1)^2} \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial s_i}{\\partial x} = k_B \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(x) - 1 - x\\exp(x) - \\exp(x) + 1}{(\\exp(x) - 1)^2} \\right] = k_B \\frac{-x \\exp(x)}{(\\exp(x) - 1)^2} $$\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial s_i}{\\partial \\omega_i} = \\frac{\\partial s_i}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\omega_i} = \\left( k_B \\frac{-x \\exp(x)}{(\\exp(x) - 1)^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{k_B T} \\right) = - \\frac{\\hbar}{T} \\frac{x \\exp(x)}{(\\exp(x) - 1)^2} $$\nSubstituting $x = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}$ back into the expression:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial s_i}{\\partial \\omega_i} = - \\frac{\\hbar}{T} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)^2} = - \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\omega_i}{k_B T^2} \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)^2} $$\n\n**Step 2.5: Scale to Molar Entropy**\nFinally, the sensitivity of the standard molar entropy, $S^\\circ(T)$, is $N_A$ times the single-molecule result:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial S^\\circ(T)}{\\partial \\omega_i} = N_A \\frac{\\partial s_i}{\\partial \\omega_i} = -N_A \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\omega_i}{k_B T^2} \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)^2} $$\nThis expression represents the change in the standard molar entropy of the system with respect to an infinitesimal change in a single vibrational frequency $\\omega_i$.",
