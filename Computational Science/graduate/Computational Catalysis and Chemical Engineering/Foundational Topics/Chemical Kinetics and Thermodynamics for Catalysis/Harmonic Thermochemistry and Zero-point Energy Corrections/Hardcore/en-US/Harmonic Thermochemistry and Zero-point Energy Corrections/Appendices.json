            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of thermochemical properties for a diatomic molecule modeled as a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The solution proceeds by first deriving the vibrational wavenumber, then calculating the zero-point energy, and finally correcting the electronic dissociation energy.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Harmonic Vibrational Wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$**\n\nThe analysis begins with the classical equation of motion for a particle of reduced mass $\\mu$ under the influence of a linear restoring force $F = -kx$, where $k$ is the harmonic force constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position. According to Newton's second law of motion, $F = \\mu a$, where the acceleration is $a = \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$. This yields:\n$$\n-kx = \\mu \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged into the standard form for a simple harmonic oscillator:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \\left(\\frac{k}{\\mu}\\right)x = 0\n$$\nThis equation is of the general form $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \\omega^2 x = 0$, where $\\omega$ is the classical angular frequency of oscillation. By comparing the two forms, we can identify the angular frequency as:\n$$\n\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nThe angular frequency $\\omega$ (in units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) is related to the ordinary frequency $\\nu$ (in units of $\\mathrm{Hz}$ or $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) by the relation $\\omega = 2\\pi\\nu$. Therefore, the expression for the ordinary frequency is:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nThe wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is defined as the reciprocal of the wavelength $\\lambda$, and it is related to the ordinary frequency $\\nu$ through the speed of light, $c$, by the relation $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{\\nu}{c}$. Substituting the expression for $\\nu$ gives the final expression for the harmonic vibrational wavenumber:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nTo ensure that $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is expressed in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, a consistent set of units must be used for the constants and variables. Specifically, the speed of light $c$ must be in units of $\\mathrm{cm}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The term $\\sqrt{k/\\mu}$ must have units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Using SI units for $k$ ($\\mathrm{N}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$) and $\\mu$ ($\\mathrm{kg}$), the units of the ratio $k/\\mu$ become $\\frac{\\mathrm{N}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = \\frac{(\\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-2})\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = \\mathrm{s}^{-2}$. Consequently, $\\sqrt{k/\\mu}$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The overall expression for $\\tilde{\\nu}$ then has units of $\\frac{\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{\\mathrm{cm}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, as desired.\n\n**2. Numerical Calculation of $\\tilde{\\nu}$**\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Reduced mass, $\\mu = 1.328 \\times 10^{-26}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Force constant, $k = 1170\\ \\mathrm{N}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n- Speed of light, $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\tilde{\\nu}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi (2.99792458 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})} \\sqrt{\\frac{1170\\ \\mathrm{N}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}}{1.328 \\times 10^{-26}\\ \\mathrm{kg}}}\n$$\nFirst, evaluating the term inside the square root:\n$$\n\\frac{k}{\\mu} = \\frac{1170}{1.328 \\times 10^{-26}}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-2} \\approx 8.80948795 \\times 10^{28}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-2}\n$$\nNext, the angular frequency $\\omega$ is computed:\n$$\n\\omega = \\sqrt{8.80948795 \\times 10^{28}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-2}} \\approx 2.96807813 \\times 10^{14}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nFinally, dividing by $2\\pi c$ yields the wavenumber:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{2.96807813 \\times 10^{14}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2\\pi (2.99792458 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})} \\approx 1575.6946\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThis value will be used with higher precision in the subsequent steps.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Zero-Point Energy per Mole**\n\nThe energy levels of the quantum harmonic oscillator are quantized and given by the formula $E_v = (v + \\frac{1}{2})h\\nu$, where $v = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the vibrational quantum number and $h$ is the Planck constant. The zero-point energy ($ZPE$) is the energy of the lowest vibrational state, corresponding to $v=0$:\n$$\nZPE_{\\mathrm{molecule}} = E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}h\\nu\n$$\nUsing the relation $\\nu = c\\tilde{\\nu}$, the $ZPE$ for a single molecule can be expressed in terms of the wavenumber:\n$$\nZPE_{\\mathrm{molecule}} = \\frac{1}{2}hc\\tilde{\\nu}\n$$\nTo obtain the zero-point energy per mole ($ZPE_{\\mathrm{mole}}$), we multiply the energy per molecule by the Avogadro constant, $N_A$:\n$$\nZPE_{\\mathrm{mole}} = N_A \\cdot ZPE_{\\mathrm{molecule}} = \\frac{1}{2}N_A h c \\tilde{\\nu}\n$$\nThis quantity needs to be calculated in units of $\\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. The product $N_A h c \\tilde{\\nu}$ yields a result in $\\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, so a conversion factor of $\\frac{1}{1000}$ is needed.

Calculation of the Dissociation Energy $D_0$**\n\nThe electronic dissociation energy, $D_e$, is the energy difference from the minimum of the potential energy curve to the separated atoms at infinite distance (the \"well depth\"). In reality, a molecule cannot exist at this minimum due to the uncertainty principle; its lowest possible energy is the zero-point energy, $ZPE_{\\mathrm{mole}}$, above the minimum. The dissociation energy from the vibrational ground state, $D_0$, is the energy required to break the bond starting from this $v=0$ level. The relationship between these quantities is:\n$$\nD_0 = D_e - ZPE_{\\mathrm{mole}}\n$$\nGiven the electronic dissociation energy $D_e = 498.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ and using the calculated molar zero-point energy:\n$$\nD_0 = 498.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} - 9.421975\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\approx 488.578025\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requests the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nD_0 \\approx 488.6\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\n$$",

The deuterated species has a lower zero-point energy (negative $\\Delta E_{\\text{ZPE}}$), stabilizing the vibrationally unexcited state. In a typical primary kinetic isotope effect, the corresponding bond is partially weakened in the transition state, so the transition-state analog of this mode has a lower frequency than in the reactant (or is projected out along the reaction coordinate). Consequently, the zero-point energy decreases more in the reactant than in the transition state upon deuteration, increasing the difference $E_{\\text{TS}} - E_{\\text{R}}$ and thereby increasing $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ for deuterium relative to hydrogen. Quantitatively, the barrier increase equals the difference of zero-point energy changes between transition state and reactant for the affected modes; without a specific transition-state frequency, we cannot compute an exact value, but the sign is expected to be positive (a higher barrier for deuterium), consistent with a normal kinetic isotope effect.",

The relationship between $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$ and $K^\\circ$ is:\n$$\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = -RT \\ln K^\\circ \\implies K^\\circ = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{rxn}}}{RT}\\right)$$\nThe ratio of the wrong to the true equilibrium constant is:\n$$\\frac{K^\\circ_{\\mathrm{wrong}}}{K^\\circ_{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{rxn, wrong}}}{RT}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{rxn, true}}}{RT}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{rxn, wrong}} - \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{rxn, true}}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{rxn}}}{RT}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\delta \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$:\n$$\\frac{K^\\circ_{\\mathrm{wrong}}}{K^\\circ_{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{RT \\ln(\\sigma_{\\text{true}}/\\sigma_{\\text{wrong}})}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{true}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{wrong}}}\\right)\\right)$$\nUsing the identity $\\exp(-\\ln(x)) = 1/x$:\n$$\\frac{K^\\circ_{\\mathrm{wrong}}}{K^\\circ_{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{\\text{true}}/\\sigma_{\\text{wrong}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{wrong}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{true}}}$$\nThis result could also be found directly from the statistical mechanical definition of the equilibrium constant $K^\\circ(T) = \\frac{q^\\circ_B/N_A}{q^\\circ_A/N_A} \\exp(-\\frac{\\Delta E_{0,m}}{RT})$, which shows that $K^\\circ$ is inversely proportional to $q^\\circ_A$. Since $q^\\circ_A$ is inversely proportional to $\\sigma_A$, it follows that $K^\\circ$ is directly proportional to $\\sigma_A$.
