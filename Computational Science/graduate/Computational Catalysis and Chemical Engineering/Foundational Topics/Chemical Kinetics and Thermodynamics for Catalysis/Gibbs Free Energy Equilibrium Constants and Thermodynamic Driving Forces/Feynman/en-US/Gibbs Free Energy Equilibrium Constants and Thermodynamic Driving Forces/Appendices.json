All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or violations of physical principles.\n\nThe central task is to calculate the instantaneous Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G$, for the reversible isomerization reaction $A \\rightleftharpoons B$ under non-equilibrium conditions. The fundamental relationship connecting the chemical potential $\\mu_i$ of a species $i$ to its activity $a_i$ at a given temperature $T$ is:\n$$ \\mu_i = \\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\ln a_i $$\nwhere $\\mu_i^\\circ$ is the standard chemical potential of species $i$ (defined at unit activity), and $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change of reaction, $\\Delta G$, is defined as the difference between the sum of the chemical potentials of the products and the sum of the chemical potentials of the reactants, each weighted by their stoichiometric coefficients. For the reaction $A \\rightleftharpoons B$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta G = \\mu_B - \\mu_A $$\nSubstituting the expression for the chemical potentials yields:\n$$ \\Delta G = (\\mu_B^\\circ + RT \\ln a_B) - (\\mu_A^\\circ + RT \\ln a_A) $$\nThis equation can be rearranged by grouping the standard-state terms and the activity-dependent terms:\n$$ \\Delta G = (\\mu_B^\\circ - \\mu_A^\\circ) + RT(\\ln a_B - \\ln a_A) $$\nThe term $(\\mu_B^\\circ - \\mu_A^\\circ)$ is, by definition, the standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction, denoted as $\\Delta G^\\circ$. Using the properties of logarithms, the second term can be combined:\n$$ \\Delta G = \\Delta G^\\circ + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_B}{a_A}\\right) $$\nThe ratio of activities under any given set of conditions is called the reaction quotient, $Q$. For this reaction:\n$$ Q = \\frac{a_B}{a_A} $$\nThus, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\Delta G = \\Delta G^\\circ + RT \\ln Q $$\nAt equilibrium, $\\Delta G = 0$ and the reaction quotient $Q$ is equal to the equilibrium constant $K$. This gives the fundamental relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change and the equilibrium constant:\n$$ 0 = \\Delta G^\\circ + RT \\ln K \\implies \\Delta G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K $$\nBy substituting this expression for $\\Delta G^\\circ$ back into the equation for $\\Delta G$, we obtain a final, convenient expression that relates $\\Delta G$ directly to the reaction quotient $Q$ and the equilibrium constant $K$:\n$$ \\Delta G = -RT \\ln K + RT \\ln Q = RT \\left(\\ln Q - \\ln K\\right) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{Q}{K}\\right) $$\nThis equation directly shows that the sign of $\\Delta G$ is determined by the ratio of $Q$ to $K$.

There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a standard, formalizable problem in chemical kinetics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation and Calculation**\n\nThe solution requires connecting the thermodynamic description of equilibrium with the kinetic description.\n\nFirst, the relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, and the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, $K$, is given by the fundamental equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nSecond, for the elementary reversible reaction $I^{*} \\rightleftharpoons J^{*}$, the principle of detailed balance (or microscopic reversibility) must hold at equilibrium. This principle states that at equilibrium, the rate of every elementary forward process is equal to the rate of its reverse process. Applying the law of mass action to the surface species, where their activities are idealized and can be represented by their equilibrium surface concentrations (or coverages), $[I^{*}]_{eq}$ and $[J^{*}]_{eq}$:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{forward}} = k_f [I^{*}]_{eq}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{reverse}} = k_r [J^{*}]_{eq}\n$$\nAt equilibrium, $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{forward}} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{reverse}}$, which gives:\n$$\nk_f [I^{*}]_{eq} = k_r [J^{*}]_{eq}\n$$\nRearranging this expression yields the ratio of equilibrium concentrations, which is, by definition, the equilibrium constant $K$:\n$$\nK = \\frac{[J^{*}]_{eq}}{[I^{*}]_{eq}} = \\frac{k_f}{k_r}\n$$\nThis provides the crucial kinetic expression for the equilibrium constant.\n\nNow, we equate the thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives by substituting the expression for $K$ into the Gibbs free energy equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_f}{k_r}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires an expression for the reverse rate constant, $k_r$. We must solve this equation for $k_r$.\n$$\n-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{RT} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_f}{k_r}\\right)\n$$\nExponentiating both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{RT}\\right) = \\frac{k_f}{k_r}\n$$\nFinally, isolating $k_r$ gives the desired expression:\n$$\nk_r = \\frac{k_f}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{RT}\\right)} = k_f \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the reverse rate constant. A positive $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ implies that the products are less stable than the reactants, leading to an equilibrium that favors the reactants. Kinetically, this means the reverse reaction must be faster than the forward reaction, i.e., $k_r > k_f$, which is consistent with this derived expression since $\\exp(\\Delta G^{\\circ}/RT) > 1$ for a positive $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $k_r$ using the provided data. It is critical to ensure consistency of units. The standard Gibbs free energy is given in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, which must be converted to $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ to be compatible with the units of $R$.\n\nGiven values:\n-   $k_f = 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n-   $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = 20\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 20 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n-   $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n-   $T = 800\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless exponent term, $\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{RT}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{RT} = \\frac{20000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(800\\,\\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{20000}{6651.2} \\approx 3.006976185\n$$\nNow, substitute this value into the expression for $k_r$:\n$$\nk_r = (10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times \\exp(3.006976185)\n$$\n$$\nk_r \\approx (10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times 20.225904\n$$\n$$\nk_r \\approx 2022590.4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 2.0225904 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nk_r \\approx 2.023 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$",
