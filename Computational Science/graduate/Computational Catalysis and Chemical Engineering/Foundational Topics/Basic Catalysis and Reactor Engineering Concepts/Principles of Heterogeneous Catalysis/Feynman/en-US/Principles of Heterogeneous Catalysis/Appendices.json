This practice explores the fundamental concept of competitive adsorption, where multiple gas-phase molecules vie for a finite number of active sites. By starting from basic equilibrium principles and the site balance, you will derive the competitive Langmuir isotherms . Mastering this model is crucial for understanding how the presence of products, intermediates, or poisons can affect catalyst surface coverage and, consequently, the overall reaction rate and selectivity.",

            "problem": "Consider a perfectly uniform catalytic surface with a single kind of adsorption site, denoted by the vacant site symbol $*$. Two gas-phase species, $A$ and $B$, competitively adsorb via the elementary equilibria $A(\\mathrm{g}) + * \\rightleftharpoons A*$ and $B(\\mathrm{g}) + * \\rightleftharpoons B*$. Assume the following physically grounded conditions: ideal gas behavior in the gas phase, a thermodynamically ideal adsorbed lattice without lateral interactions or multisite occupancy, and a well-mixed, isothermal environment so that adsorption equilibria are established. Let $p_A$ and $p_B$ denote the partial pressures of $A$ and $B$, respectively, and let $\\theta_A$, $\\theta_B$, and $\\theta_*$ denote the fractional coverages of $A*$, $B*$, and vacant sites, respectively, on the surface. The site balance is $ \\theta_A + \\theta_B + \\theta_* = 1$.\n\nDefine the adsorption equilibrium constants $K_A$ and $K_B$ with units of inverse pressure, consistent with $p_A$ and $p_B$ expressed in the same pressure units, by the ideal-activity mass-action relationships implied by adsorption thermodynamics. Specifically, under the ideal assumptions stated above and a standard pressure $p^{0}$, the dimensionless mass-action constants satisfy $K_A^{\\mathrm{(dimless)}} = (\\theta_A/\\theta_*)(p^{0}/p_A)$ and $K_B^{\\mathrm{(dimless)}} = (\\theta_B/\\theta_*)(p^{0}/p_B)$. For convenience in engineering calculations, define $K_A \\equiv K_A^{\\mathrm{(dimless)}}/p^{0}$ and $K_B \\equiv K_B^{\\mathrm{(dimless)}}/p^{0}$, which therefore have units of inverse pressure.\n\nStarting only from the fundamental site balance and the ideal mass-action definitions above, derive closed-form analytical expressions for the competitive coverages $\\theta_A(p_A,p_B)$ and $\\theta_B(p_A,p_B)$ on the single type of site.

Ensure that any intermediate dimensional parameters use bar as the pressure unit so that the products $K_A p_A$ and $K_B p_B$ are dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the competitive Langmuir adsorption isotherms for two species, $A$ and $B$, on a uniform surface, followed by a numerical calculation for specific conditions. The derivation proceeds from the fundamental principles of adsorption equilibrium and site conservation.\n\nThe problem statement provides the definitions for the adsorption equilibrium constants, $K_A$ and $K_B$, which have units of inverse pressure. These definitions are consistent with the mass-action relationships for the adsorption equilibria $A(\\mathrm{g}) + * \\rightleftharpoons A*$ and $B(\\mathrm{g}) + * \\rightleftharpoons B*$. The relationships are:\n$$K_A = \\frac{\\theta_A}{p_A \\theta_*}$$\n$$K_B = \\frac{\\theta_B}{p_B \\theta_*}$$\nHere, $\\theta_A$, $\\theta_B$, and $\\theta_*$ represent the fractional coverages of sites occupied by species $A$, species $B$, and vacant sites ($*$), respectively. The partial pressures of the gas-phase species are denoted by $p_A$ and $p_B$.\n\nFrom these equilibrium expressions, we can express the coverages of the adsorbed species, $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$, in terms of the vacant site coverage, $\\theta_*$, and the partial pressures:\n$$\\theta_A = K_A p_A \\theta_*$$\n$$\\theta_B = K_B p_B \\theta_*$$\n\nThe total number of available sites on the catalytic surface is conserved. Therefore, the sum of the fractional coverages of all entities on the surface must be equal to $1$. This is described by the site balance equation:\n$$\\theta_A + \\theta_B + \\theta_* = 1$$\n\nTo derive expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ that are independent of the unknown vacant site coverage $\\theta_*$, we substitute the expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ from the equilibrium relations into the site balance equation:\n$$(K_A p_A \\theta_*) + (K_B p_B \\theta_*) + \\theta_* = 1$$\n\nWe can then solve this algebraic equation for $\\theta_*$. Factoring $\\theta_*$ from each term on the left-hand side yields:\n$$\\theta_* (K_A p_A + K_B p_B + 1) = 1$$\nIsolating $\\theta_*$ gives the expression for the fractional coverage of vacant sites:\n$$\\theta_* = \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B}$$\n\nWith this explicit expression for $\\theta_*$, we can now determine the final closed-form analytical expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$. We substitute the expression for $\\theta_*$ back into the rearranged equilibrium relations:\nFor the coverage of species $A$, $\\theta_A$:\n$$\\theta_A = K_A p_A \\theta_* = K_A p_A \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} \\right)$$\nThis yields the final expression for $\\theta_A(p_A, p_B)$:\n$$\\theta_A(p_A, p_B) = \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B}$$\nSimilarly, for the coverage of species $B$, $\\theta_B$:\n$$\\theta_B = K_B p_B \\theta_* = K_B p_B \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} \\right)$$\nThis yields the final expression for $\\theta_B(p_A, p_B)$:\n$$\\theta_B(p_A, p_B) = \\frac{K_B p_B}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B}$$\nThese two equations represent the competitive Langmuir adsorption isotherms for species $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the numerical values of these coverages using the provided data:\n$K_A = 4.0~\\mathrm{bar}^{-1}$\n$K_B = 0.5~\\mathrm{bar}^{-1}$\n$p_A = 0.20~\\mathrm{bar}$\n$p_B = 0.80~\\mathrm{bar}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless products $K_A p_A$ and $K_B p_B$. The problem ensures the pressure units are consistent such that these products are dimensionless.\n$$K_A p_A = (4.0) \\times (0.20) = 0.80$$\n$$K_B p_B = (0.5) \\times (0.80) = 0.40$$\nNext, we calculate the value of the denominator term, which appears in both isotherm expressions:\n$$1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B = 1 + 0.80 + 0.40 = 2.20$$\nNow we can compute the numerical values of the fractional coverages, $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$:\n$$\\theta_A = \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} = \\frac{0.80}{2.20} = \\frac{8}{22} = \\frac{4}{11}$$\n$$\\theta_B = \\frac{K_B p_B}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} = \\frac{0.40}{2.20} = \\frac{4}{22} = \\frac{2}{11}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the final numerical answers to be rounded to four significant figures.\nFor $\\theta_A$:\n$$\\theta_A = \\frac{4}{11} \\approx 0.363636... \\approx 0.3636$$\nFor $\\theta_B$:\n$$\\theta_B = \\frac{2}{11} \\approx 0.181818... \\approx 0.1818$$\nThese values represent the fractional surface coverages of species $A$ and $B$, respectively, under the specified conditions.",

The gas is characterized by molecular mass $m$, absolute pressure $p$, and absolute temperature $T$. Assume ideal-gas behavior and that the gas-phase velocity distribution is Maxwell–Boltzmann. The surface has a fractional coverage $\\theta$ of identical, noninteracting adsorption sites that block incoming molecules in proportion to site occupancy (Langmuir site-blocking), and the intrinsic sticking coefficient at zero coverage is a constant $s=0.3$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the molar adsorption rate, $r_{\\mathrm{ads}}$, for a dilute ideal gas impinging on a catalytic surface. The derivation must start from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution and the Ideal Gas Law.\n\nFirst, we will derive the molecular impingement flux, $J$, which is the number of gas molecules striking a unit area of the surface per unit time. Let the surface be oriented in the $xy$-plane. Molecules that strike the surface must have a velocity component along the positive $z$-axis, so $v_z > 0$.\n\nThe number of molecules per unit volume having velocity components in the infinitesimal range $(v_x, v_x+dv_x)$, $(v_y, v_y+dv_y)$, and $(v_z, v_z+dv_z)$ is given by $n \\cdot f(v_x, v_y, v_z) \\, dv_x \\, dv_y \\, dv_z$. Here, $n$ is the total molecular number density, and $f(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ is the normalized velocity distribution function.\n\nThe number of these molecules crossing a unit area in the $xy$-plane per unit time is this number density multiplied by their velocity component normal to the surface, $v_z$. The total flux $J$ is obtained by integrating this differential flux over all possible transverse velocities ($v_x$ and $v_y$ from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$) and all approaching normal velocities ($v_z$ from $0$ to $\\infty$):\n$$J = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} n \\, v_z \\, f(v_x, v_y, v_z) \\, dv_x \\, dv_y \\, dv_z$$\nFor an ideal gas in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$, the velocity distribution is the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution:\n$$f(v_x, v_y, v_z) = \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $m$ is the molecular mass and $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant.\n\nSubstituting the distribution into the flux integral yields:\n$$J = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} v_z \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2k_B T}\\right) \\, dv_x \\, dv_y \\, dv_z$$\nThe integral is separable into three independent integrals:\n$$J = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_x^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_x \\right] \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_y^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_y \\right] \\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v_z \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_z^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_z \\right]$$\nThe integrals over $v_x$ and $v_y$ are standard Gaussian integrals of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2) dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$.

It is the product of the impingement flux $J$ and the effective sticking probability $s_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The problem specifies that $s_{\\mathrm{eff}} = s(1-\\theta)$, where $s$ is the intrinsic sticking coefficient and $\\theta$ is the fractional surface coverage. The rate in molecular units is:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{\\text{molecular}} = J \\cdot s_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{p s(1-\\theta)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}}$$\nThe problem asks for the adsorption rate in molar units, $r_{\\mathrm{ads}}$, in $\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$.

Thus, $E_2 = \\max\\{0.9, 0\\} = 0.9\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n3.  $k_1 = (1.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.0}{0.051704}\\right) = 1.0 \\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n4.  $k_2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.9}{0.051704}\\right) \\approx 2.495 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n5.  $r = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2} \\approx k_2 \\approx 2.495 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, since $k_1 \\gg k_2$.\n\n**Case 2: $\\Delta E = -0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}$**\n1.  $E_1 = \\max\\{0.4 + 0.5(-0.5), 0\\} = \\max\\{0.15, 0\\} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n2.  $E_2 = \\max\\{0.4 - 0.5(-0.5), 0\\} = \\max\\{0.65, 0\\} = 0.65\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n3.  $k_1 = (1.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.15}{0.051704}\\right) \\approx 5.498 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n4.  $k_2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.65}{0.051704}\\right) \\approx 3.475 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n5.  $r = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2} \\approx k_2 \\approx 3.475 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, since $k_1 \\gg k_2$.\n\n**Case 3: $\\Delta E = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$**\nThis corresponds to the apex of the volcano plot, where the system is thermoneutral and maximally active.\n1.  $E_1 = \\max\\{0.4, 0\\} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n2.  $E_2 = \\max\\{0.4, 0\\} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n3.  $k_1 = k_2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.4}{0.051704}\\right) \\approx 4.370 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n4.  $r = \\frac{k_1 \\cdot k_1}{k_1 + k_1} = \\frac{k_1}{2} \\approx 2.185 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\n**Case 4: $\\Delta E = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}$**\nBy symmetry, $E_1(0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = E_2(-0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV})$ and $E_2(0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = E_1(-0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV})$.\n1.  $E_1 = \\max\\{0.4 + 0.5(0.5), 0\\} = \\max\\{0.65, 0\\} = 0.65\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n2.  $E_2 = \\max\\{0.4 - 0.5(0.5), 0\\} = \\max\\{0.15, 0\\} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n3.  $k_1 \\approx 3.475 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n4.  $k_2 \\approx 5.498 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n5.  $r = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2} \\approx k_1 \\approx 3.475 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, since $k_2 \\gg k_1$.\n\n**Case 5: $\\Delta E = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$**\nBy symmetry, $E_1(1.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = E_2(-1.0\\,\\mathrm{eV})$ and $E_2(1.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = E_1(-1.0\\,\\mathrm{eV})$.\n1.  $E_1 = \\max\\{0.4 + 0.5(1.0), 0\\} = \\max\\{0.9, 0\\} = 0.9\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n2.  $E_2 = \\max\\{0.4 - 0.5(1.0), 0\\} = \\max\\{-0.1, 0\\} = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n3.  $k_1 \\approx 2.495 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n4.  $k_2 = 1.0 \\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n5.  $r = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2} \\approx k_1 \\approx 2.495 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, since $k_2 \\gg k_1$.\n\nThe results illustrate the characteristic volcano-shaped dependence of the catalytic rate on the descriptor $\\Delta E$. The rate is low for very negative $\\Delta E$ (strong binding, high barrier for product release) and for very positive $\\Delta E$ (weak binding, high barrier for reactant activation). The maximum rate is achieved at $\\Delta E=0$, where the barriers for both steps are balanced.",
