Calculate the numerical value of $T^{\\ast}$ in Kelvin, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is subjected to the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of chemical kinetics and heterogeneous catalysis. The Arrhenius equation and the concept of the degree of rate control are standard and well-established in the field. The provided physical model (parallel elementary pathways on a surface) is a common scenario in catalysis.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary definitions, equations, and data to arrive at a unique solution. The objectives are clearly stated and mathematically formalizable.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise, quantitative, and free of any subjective or opinion-based claims.\n- **No Flaws Identified:** The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not based on false premises, is not metaphorical or trivial, and contains a complete and consistent set of information. The numerical values are physically plausible for such a system.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to derive expressions for the degrees of rate control, $X_{A}(T)$ and $X_{B}(T)$. The definition of the DRC for step $i$ is given as\n$$\nX_{i}(T) = \\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial \\ln k_{i}}\n$$\nUsing the chain rule of differentiation, we can rewrite this as:\n$$\nX_{i} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial r} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial k_{i}} \\frac{\\partial k_{i}}{\\partial \\ln k_{i}}\n$$\nLet's evaluate each term.\nThe derivative of $\\ln r$ with respect to $r$ is $\\frac{1}{r}$.\nThe derivative of $\\ln k_{i}$ with respect to $k_{i}$ is $\\frac{1}{k_{i}}$, which implies $\\frac{\\partial k_{i}}{\\partial \\ln k_{i}} = k_{i}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $X_i$ gives:\n$$\nX_{i} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial k_{i}} k_{i}\n$$\nThe overall rate is $r = C(k_{A} + k_{B})$. We now find the partial derivatives of $r$ with respect to $k_{A}$ and $k_{B}$.\nFor step $A$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial k_{A}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_{A}} [C(k_{A} + k_{B})] = C\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $X_{A}$:\n$$\nX_{A}(T) = \\frac{1}{C(k_{A} + k_{B})} (C) k_{A} = \\frac{k_{A}(T)}{k_{A}(T) + k_{B}(T)}\n$$\nBy symmetry, for step $B$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial k_{B}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_{B}} [C(k_{A} + k_{B})] = C\n$$\n$$\nX_{B}(T) = \\frac{1}{C(k_{A} + k_{B})} (C) k_{B} = \\frac{k_{B}(T)}{k_{A}(T) + k_{B}(T)}\n$$\nThese are the explicit expressions for $X_{A}(T)$ and $X_{B}(T)$. Notably, $X_{A}(T) + X_{B}(T) = 1$, which is a sum rule for DRCs in such systems.\n\nThe second task is to explain the physical significance of a crossing of $X_{A}(T)$ and $X_{B}(T)$. $X_{i}$ quantifies the sensitivity of the overall rate $r$ to a change in the rate constant $k_i$. It represents the fractional contribution of pathway $i$ to the total rate. A crossing point, defined by the condition $X_{A}(T^{\\ast}) = X_{B}(T^{\\ast})$, is the temperature at which both pathways have equal control over the overall rate. At this point, $X_{A}(T^{\\ast}) = X_{B}(T^{\\ast}) = 0.5$. This means that a small fractional change in $k_{A}$ has the exact same fractional effect on $r$ as an equal fractional change in $k_{B}$. As temperature increases through $T^{\\ast}$, the pathway that becomes kinetically dominant (i.e., has the larger rate constant) will also become the one with the higher degree of rate control. This transition at $T^{\\ast}$ represents a switch in the pathway that is most sensitive and predominantly controls the overall reaction rate.\n\nThe third task is to derive a closed-form expression for the switching temperature $T^{\\ast}$. The crossing condition is $X_{A}(T^{\\ast}) = X_{B}(T^{\\ast})$. Using the expressions derived above, this implies:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{A}(T^{\\ast})}{k_{A}(T^{\\ast}) + k_{B}(T^{\\ast})} = \\frac{k_{B}(T^{\\ast})}{k_{A}(T^{\\ast}) + k_{B}(T^{\\ast})}\n$$\nFor this equality to hold, the numerators must be equal:\n$$\nk_{A}(T^{\\ast}) = k_{B}(T^{\\ast})\n$$\nThis condition signifies that the switching temperature is precisely the temperature at which the rates of the two parallel pathways are equal. Now, we substitute the Arrhenius expressions for the rate constants:\n$$\nA_{A} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{A}}{R T^{\\ast}}\\right) = A_{B} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{B}}{R T^{\\ast}}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $T^{\\ast}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(A_{A} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{A}}{R T^{\\ast}}\\right)\\right) = \\ln\\left(A_{B} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{B}}{R T^{\\ast}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(A_{A}) - \\frac{E_{A}}{R T^{\\ast}} = \\ln(A_{B}) - \\frac{E_{B}}{R T^{\\ast}}\n$$\nNext, we rearrange the equation to isolate the terms containing $T^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{B}}{R T^{\\ast}} - \\frac{E_{A}}{R T^{\\ast}} = \\ln(A_{B}) - \\ln(A_{A})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{E_{B} - E_{A}}{R T^{\\ast}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{B}}{A_{A}}\\right)\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{A} - E_{B}}{R T^{\\ast}} = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{B}}{A_{A}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{A_{B}}{A_{A}}\\right)^{-1}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{A}}{A_{B}}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, solving for $T^{\\ast}$ yields the closed-form expression:\n$$\nT^{\\ast} = \\frac{E_{A} - E_{B}}{R \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{A}}{A_{B}}\\right)}\n$$\nThe fourth task is to evaluate $T^{\\ast}$ numerically. The provided values are:\n$A_{A} = 1.0 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$E_{A} = 100\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = 100 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n$A_{B} = 1.0 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$E_{B} = 80\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = 80 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n$R = 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the differences and ratios needed for the formula:\nThe difference in activation energies is:\n$$\nE_{A} - E_{B} = 100 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} - 80 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = 20 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe ratio of pre-exponential factors is:\n$$\n\\frac{A_{A}}{A_{B}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.0 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 10\n$$\nNow, we substitute these values into the expression for $T^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nT^{\\ast} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1} \\times \\ln(10)}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$\nT^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{20000}{8.314 \\times 2.302585}\\ \\mathrm{K} \\approx \\frac{20000}{19.1442}\\ \\mathrm{K} \\approx 1044.700\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\nT^{\\ast} \\approx 1045\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$",

Derivation of the Turnover Frequency (TOF)**\n\nThe proposed microkinetic model consists of three elementary steps:\n- Adsorption: $A(g) + * \\xrightarrow{k_{1f}} A*$\n- Desorption: $A* \\xrightarrow{k_{1r}} A(g) + *$\n- Surface reaction: $A* \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} P(g) + *$\n\nThe rates for these steps are given as:\n- Adsorption rate: $r_{1f} = k_{1f}(T) \\, p_A \\, \\theta_*$\n- Desorption rate: $r_{1r} = k_{1r}(T) \\, \\theta_A$\n- Surface reaction rate: $r_2 = k_2(T) \\, \\theta_A$\n\nHere, $\\theta_A$ is the fractional coverage of the adsorbed species $A*$, and $\\theta_*$ is the fraction of vacant sites. The total number of sites is conserved, leading to the site balance equation:\n$$ \\theta_A + \\theta_* = 1 \\implies \\theta_* = 1 - \\theta_A $$\nThe rate of change of the surface coverage of $A*$ is given by the balance of the rates of steps that produce it and consume it:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = r_{1f} - r_{1r} - r_2 $$\nSubstituting the rate expressions and the site balance:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = k_{1f} p_A (1 - \\theta_A) - k_{1r} \\theta_A - k_2 \\theta_A $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = k_{1f} p_A - (k_{1f} p_A + k_{1r} + k_2) \\theta_A $$\nThe problem requires analysis at steady state, which is defined by the condition that the net rate of change of all surface intermediates is zero. Thus, we set $\\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ 0 = k_{1f} p_A - (k_{1f} p_A + k_{1r} + k_2) \\theta_A $$\nSolving for the steady-state coverage, $\\theta_{A,ss}$:\n$$ \\theta_{A,ss} = \\frac{k_{1f} p_A}{k_{1f} p_A + k_{1r} + k_2} $$\nThe turnover frequency (TOF) is defined as the steady-state rate of product formation per site. In this mechanism, the product $P(g)$ is formed only in the surface reaction step. Therefore, $\\mathrm{TOF} = r_2$ evaluated at steady state:\n$$ \\mathrm{TOF}(T) = k_2(T) \\, \\theta_{A,ss} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\theta_{A,ss}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{TOF}(T) = k_2 \\frac{k_{1f} p_A}{k_{1f} p_A + k_{1r} + k_2} $$\nThis expression represents the TOF as a function of the rate constants ($k_{1f}$, $k_{1r}$, $k_2$) and the partial pressure $p_A$. The temperature dependence is embedded in the rate constants via the Arrhenius law, $k_i(T) = A_i \\exp(-E_i / (RT))$.\n\n**2. Derivation of Normalized Sensitivities**\n\nThe normalized sensitivity of the TOF with respect to a parameter $p$ is defined as:\n$$ S_p^{\\mathrm{TOF}} \\equiv \\frac{p}{\\mathrm{TOF}} \\frac{\\partial \\, \\mathrm{TOF}}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(\\mathrm{TOF})}{\\partial \\ln(p)} $$\nThe parameters $p$ are the Arrhenius parameters $\\{A_{1f}, A_{1r}, A_2, E_{1f}, E_{1r}, E_2\\}$.\n\nTo derive the sensitivities, we first express the logarithm of the TOF:\n$$ \\ln(\\mathrm{TOF}) = \\ln(k_2) + \\ln(k_{1f}) + \\ln(p_A) - \\ln(k_{1f}p_A + k_{1r} + k_2) $$\nThe sensitivities with respect to the pre-exponential factors ($S_{A_i}^{\\mathrm{TOF}}$) are found by differentiating $\\ln(\\mathrm{TOF})$ with respect to $\\ln(A_i)$. Since $\\partial \\ln(k_i) / \\partial \\ln(A_i) = 1$, this is equivalent to differentiating with respect to $\\ln(k_i)$.\nLet $D = k_{1f} p_A + k_{1r} + k_2$.\n\n- $S_{A_{1f}}^{\\mathrm{TOF}} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(\\mathrm{TOF})}{\\partial \\ln(k_{1f})} = 1 - \\frac{k_{1f} p_A}{D} = \\frac{k_{1r} + k_2}{D}$\n- $S_{A_{1r}}^{\\mathrm{TOF}} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(\\mathrm{TOF})}{\\partial \\ln(k_{1r})} = 0 - \\frac{k_{1r}}{D} = -\\frac{k_{1r}}{D}$\n- $S_{A_2}^{\\mathrm{TOF}} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(\\mathrm{TOF})}{\\partial \\ln(k_2)} = 1 - \\frac{k_2}{D} = \\frac{k_{1f} p_A + k_{1r}}{D}$\n\nThe sensitivities with respect to the activation energies ($S_{E_i}^{\\mathrm{TOF}}$) can be related to the sensitivities to the pre-exponential factors using the chain rule:\n$S_{E_i}^{\\mathrm{TOF}} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(\\mathrm{TOF})}{\\partial \\ln(E_i)} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(\\mathrm{TOF})}{\\partial \\ln(k_i)} \\frac{\\partial \\ln(k_i)}{\\partial \\ln(E_i)} = S_{A_i}^{\\mathrm{TOF}} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{E_i}{RT}\\right)$\n\n**Summary of Final Sensitivity Expressions**\nLet $D(T) = k_{1f}(T) p_A + k_{1r}(T) + k_2(T)$, where $k_i(T) = A_i \\exp(-E_i / (RT))$.\n\n- $S_{A_{1f}}^{\\mathrm{TOF}}(T) = \\frac{k_{1r}(T) + k_2(T)}{D(T)}$\n- $S_{A_{1r}}^{\\mathrm{TOF}}(T) = -\\frac{k_{1r}(T)}{D(T)}$\n- $S_{A_2}^{\\mathrm{TOF}}(T) = \\frac{k_{1f}(T) p_A + k_{1r}(T)}{D(T)}$\n\n- $S_{E_{1f}}^{\\mathrm{TOF}}(T) = -\\frac{E_{1f}}{RT} S_{A_{1f}}^{\\mathrm{TOF}}(T)$\n- $S_{E_{1r}}^{\\mathrm{TOF}}(T) = -\\frac{E_{1r}}{RT} S_{A_{1r}}^{\\mathrm{TOF}}(T)$\n- $S_{E_2}^{\\mathrm{TOF}}(T) = -\\frac{E_2}{RT} S_{A_2}^{\\mathrm{TOF}}(T)$\n\nThese are the expressions to be implemented numerically for the given test cases. The summation identity $\\sum_i S_{A_i}^{\\mathrm{TOF}} = 1$ is satisfied:\n$\\frac{k_{1r} + k_2}{D} - \\frac{k_{1r}}{D} + \\frac{k_{1f} p_A + k_{1r}}{D} = \\frac{k_{1r} + k_2 - k_{1r} + k_{1f} p_A + k_{1r}}{D} = \\frac{k_{1f}p_A + k_{1r} + k_2}{D} = 1$.",
