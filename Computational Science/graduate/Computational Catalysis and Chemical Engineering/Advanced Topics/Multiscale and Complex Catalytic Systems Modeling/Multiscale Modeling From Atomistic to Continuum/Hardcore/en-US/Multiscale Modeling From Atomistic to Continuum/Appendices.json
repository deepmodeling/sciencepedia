            "solution": "The solution is structured in three parts: first, the derivation of the expression for the self-diffusion coefficient $D$; second, the numerical calculation of $D$; and third, a qualitative discussion on the practical aspects of its estimation from simulation data.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Self-Diffusion Coefficient Expression**\n\nThe transport coefficient for self-diffusion, $D$, is related to microscopic fluctuations through the Green-Kubo relations. Specifically, for a three-dimensional system, $D$ is given by the time integral of the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) of a particle:\n$$\nD = \\frac{1}{3} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\langle \\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t) \\rangle \\, dt\n$$\nIn this expression, $\\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the velocity vector of the solute particle at time $t$, and the angle brackets $\\langle \\dots \\rangle$ denote an ensemble average, which in the context of an equilibrium MD simulation is equivalent to a time average over multiple time origins.\n\nThe dot product $\\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t)$ can be expanded in Cartesian coordinates as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t) = v_x(0)v_x(t) + v_y(0)v_y(t) + v_z(0)v_z(t)\n$$\nBy the linearity of the ensemble average, we have:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t) \\rangle = \\langle v_x(0)v_x(t) \\rangle + \\langle v_y(0)v_y(t) \\rangle + \\langle v_z(0)v_z(t) \\rangle\n$$\nThe problem states that the medium is isotropic. In an isotropic system, there are no preferential directions. Therefore, the statistical properties of the velocity components are identical along each Cartesian axis. This implies:\n$$\n\\langle v_x(0)v_x(t) \\rangle = \\langle v_y(0)v_y(t) \\rangle = \\langle v_z(0)v_z(t) \\rangle\n$$\nFurthermore, for an isotropic system in the absence of external fields (like a magnetic field), the velocity components are uncorrelated, meaning $\\langle v_i(0)v_j(t) \\rangle = 0$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nSubstituting the equivalence of the diagonal terms into the expression for the full VACF, we get:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t) \\rangle = 3 \\langle v_x(0)v_x(t) \\rangle\n$$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the Green-Kubo formula for $D$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{1}{3} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} 3 \\langle v_x(0)v_x(t) \\rangle \\, dt\n$$\nThe factor of $3$ cancels, leading to the desired expression for the self-diffusion coefficient in terms of the single-component VACF:\n$$\nD = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\langle v_x(0)v_x(t) \\rangle \\, dt\n$$\nThis is the required derived expression linking $D$ to the given VACF.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of D**\n\nThe problem provides the functional form for the single-component VACF for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\n\\langle v_x(0)v_x(t) \\rangle = v_{0}^{2}\\exp(-t/\\tau)\n$$\nwhere $v_{0} = 100\\,\\text{m/s}$ and $\\tau = 0.5\\,\\text{ps}$.\n\nWe substitute this function into our derived expression for $D$:\n$$\nD = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v_{0}^{2}\\exp(-t/\\tau) \\, dt\n$$\nSince $v_{0}^{2}$ is a constant, it can be taken out of the integral:\n$$\nD = v_{0}^{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\, dt\n$$\nThe integral is elementary:\n$$\n\\int \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\, dt = -\\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau)\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$:\n$$\nD = v_{0}^{2} \\left[ -\\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = v_{0}^{2} \\left( \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} (-\\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau)) - (-\\tau \\exp(-0/\\tau)) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nD = v_{0}^{2} \\left( 0 - (-\\tau \\cdot 1) \\right) = v_{0}^{2}\\tau\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for $v_{0}$ and $\\tau$. We must ensure consistent units. The desired unit for $D$ is $\\text{m}^{2}/\\text{s}$.\nThe value of $v_0$ is given as $100\\,\\text{m/s}$.\nThe value of $\\tau$ must be converted from picoseconds ($\\text{ps}$) to seconds ($\\text{s}$):\n$$\n\\tau = 0.5\\,\\text{ps} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{s}\n$$\nNow, we compute $D$:\n$$\nD = (100\\,\\text{m/s})^{2} \\cdot (0.5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{s})\n$$\n$$\nD = (1.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{m}^{2}/\\text{s}^{2}) \\cdot (0.5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{s})\n$$\n$$\nD = 0.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}^{2}/\\text{s}\n$$\n$$\nD = 5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^{2}/\\text{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, we express the result as $5.000 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^{2}/\\text{s}$.\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Discussion of Finite Sampling Effects**\n\nIn a practical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation, the analytical VACF is unknown. Instead, it is estimated from a discrete velocity trajectory of finite length. This introduces errors in the calculated $D$ due to both the truncation of the integral and the discretization of time.\n\n**Truncation of the VACF Integral:**\nThe Green-Kubo integral extends to $t=\\infty$, but in practice, it must be truncated at a finite cutoff time, $t_{cut}$.\n- **Bias:** The VACF for a simple diffusive liquid is typically a positive, decaying function. Truncating the integral at $t_{cut}$ means neglecting the positive contribution from the tail of the function for $t > t_{cut}$. This leads to a systematic underestimation of the true diffusion coefficient. This negative bias is more severe if $t_{cut}$ is chosen too small, i.e., before the VACF has fully decayed to near zero.\n- **Variance:** The statistical uncertainty (variance) of the estimated VACF, $C_{est}(t)$, itself increases with lag time $t$. This is because for larger $t$, there are fewer pairs of points in the finite trajectory separated by that time lag, leading to poorer statistics. Integrating the VACF accumulates this noise. Extending the integration limit $t_{cut}$ further into the noisy tail of the function increases the variance of the resulting estimate for $D$. Therefore, there is a trade-off: increasing $t_{cut}$ reduces bias but increases variance.\n\n**Discretization of the Trajectory:**\nMD simulations produce velocities at discrete time steps, $\\Delta t$. The VACF is thus calculated at discrete points $t_k = k \\Delta t$, and the integral is replaced by a numerical sum.\n- **Bias:** The choice of the simulation time step, $\\Delta t$, affects the accuracy of the computed VACF. If $\\Delta t$ is too large, it may fail to resolve the initial, rapid decay of the VACF (for $t \\sim \\tau$). This leads to a numerical integration error, which manifests as a bias in the estimated $D$. The initial part of the VACF often contributes significantly to the integral, so accurately capturing its shape is critical.\n- **Variance:** The time step $\\Delta t$ is not the primary factor controlling the statistical variance of the estimate of $D$. The variance is fundamentally limited by the total simulation time, $T_{sim}$. A longer simulation provides more independent data for averaging, thus reducing the variance of the estimated VACF at all lag times and, consequently, reducing the variance of the final integrated value of $D$. While a smaller $\\Delta t$ provides more points, if $T_{sim}$ is short, these points are highly correlated, and the number of statistically independent segments of the trajectory remains small, resulting in high variance.",

Rounded to four significant figures, $\\phi = 22.36$.\n\nNext, we calculate the effectiveness factor $\\eta$ using the derived expression:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{3}{\\phi^2}\\left(\\phi\\coth(\\phi)-1\\right) $$\nWith $\\phi = 10\\sqrt{5}$, we have $\\phi^2 = 500$.\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{3}{500}\\left(10\\sqrt{5}\\coth(10\\sqrt{5})-1\\right) $$\nFor large values of $x$, $\\coth(x) \\approx 1$. Since $\\phi \\approx 22.36$ is large, $\\coth(\\phi)$ is extremely close to $1$.\nSo we can approximate the term $\\phi\\coth(\\phi)-1 \\approx \\phi-1$.\n$$ \\eta \\approx \\frac{3(\\phi-1)}{\\phi^2} = \\frac{3(10\\sqrt{5}-1)}{500} \\approx \\frac{3(22.36067977-1)}{500} = \\frac{3(21.36067977)}{500} \\approx \\frac{64.08203931}{500} \\approx 0.1281640786 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\eta = 0.1282$.\n\nThe final numerical result is the ordered pair $(\\phi, \\eta)$.",
