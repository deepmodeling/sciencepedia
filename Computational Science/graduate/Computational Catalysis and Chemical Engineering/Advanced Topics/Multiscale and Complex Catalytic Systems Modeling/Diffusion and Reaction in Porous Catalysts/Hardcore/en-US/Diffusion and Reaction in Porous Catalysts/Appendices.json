There are no subjective or opinion-based elements. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Flux and Effective Diffusivity\n\nThe starting point for describing diffusion in a binary gas mixture is the Maxwell–Stefan equation. For species $A$ diffusing in species $B$ at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$, the equation is:\n$$\n\\nabla x_A = \\frac{x_B \\mathbf{N}_A - x_A \\mathbf{N}_B}{c D_{AB}}\n$$\nwhere $x_i$ is the mole fraction of species $i$, $\\mathbf{N}_i$ is the total molar flux of species $i$ relative to stationary coordinates, $c$ is the total molar concentration of the mixture, and $D_{AB}$ is the Maxwell–Stefan binary diffusivity.\n\nThe problem specifies equimolar counter-diffusion, which is defined by the condition that the molar fluxes of the two species are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n$$\n\\mathbf{N}_A + \\mathbf{N}_B = \\mathbf{0} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\mathbf{N}_B = -\\mathbf{N}_A\n$$\nThis condition also implies that the net molar flux is zero, which is consistent with the stated assumption of negligible bulk flow. Under this condition, the total flux $\\mathbf{N}_A$ is purely diffusive, so $\\mathbf{N}_A = \\mathbf{J}_A$, where $\\mathbf{J}_A$ is the diffusive flux.\n\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{N}_B = -\\mathbf{N}_A$ into the Maxwell–Stefan equation gives:\n$$\n\\nabla x_A = \\frac{x_B \\mathbf{N}_A - x_A (-\\mathbf{N}_A)}{c D_{AB}} = \\frac{(x_B + x_A) \\mathbf{N}_A}{c D_{AB}}\n$$\nSince for a binary mixture $x_A + x_B = 1$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla x_A = \\frac{\\mathbf{N}_A}{c D_{AB}}\n$$\nRearranging for the molar flux $\\mathbf{N}_A$ (which is the diffusive flux $\\mathbf{J}_A$ in this case), we obtain the expression for the flux within the fluid-filled pores. This is the Fickian form for equimolar counter-diffusion in the bulk phase:\n$$\n\\mathbf{N}_A|_{\\text{pore}} = \\mathbf{J}_A|_{\\text{pore}} = -c D_{AB} \\nabla x_A\n$$\nThis equation describes the flux per unit area of the pore space. The problem asks for the *averaged* diffusive molar flux in the pellet, denoted here as $\\mathbf{J}_A^*$. This is a superficial flux, averaged over the total cross-sectional area of the pellet (solid matrix + pores). The presence of the solid matrix hinders transport in two primary ways, which are accounted for by the porosity $\\epsilon$ and tortuosity $\\tau$.\n\n$1$. **Porosity ($\\epsilon$)**: The flux can only occur through the void space of the pellet. The cross-sectional area available for diffusion is a fraction $\\epsilon$ of the total area. This reduces the superficial flux by a factor of $\\epsilon$.\n\n$2$. **Tortuosity ($\\tau$)**: The diffusion path through the interconnected pores is not a straight line but a tortuous path of effective length $L_{eff}$, which is longer than the straight-line distance $L$ across the pellet. The tortuosity factor $\\tau$ is a measure of this path elongation. The increased path length reduces the effective concentration gradient, and thus the flux. In the common model used in chemical engineering, the flux is considered to be inversely proportional to the tortuosity factor.\n\nCombining these two effects, the superficial (averaged) flux $\\mathbf{J}_A^*$ is related to the flux in the bulk fluid by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_A^* = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\tau} \\left( -c D_{AB} \\nabla x_A \\right)\n$$\nThis is the desired form of the averaged diffusive molar flux of $A$ in the pellet.\n\nThe effective binary diffusivity in the porous medium, $D_{AB}^*$, is defined such that the superficial flux follows a Fickian-like law:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_A^* = -c D_{AB}^* \\nabla x_A\n$$\nBy comparing this definitional equation with the derived expression for $\\mathbf{J}_A^*$, we can identify the effective diffusivity:\n$$\n-c D_{AB}^* \\nabla x_A = -c \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\tau} D_{AB} \\right) \\nabla x_A\n$$\nThis directly yields the expression for the effective binary diffusivity:\n$$\nD_{AB}^* = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\tau} D_{AB}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation of $D_{AB}^*$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Porosity, $\\epsilon = 0.30$\n- Tortuosity, $\\tau = 2.0$\n- Bulk diffusivity, $D_{AB} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $D_{AB}^*$:\n$$\nD_{AB}^* = \\frac{0.30}{2.0} \\times (6.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\ \\text{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\nD_{AB}^* = 0.15 \\times (6.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\ \\text{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\nD_{AB}^* = 0.90 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\ \\text{s}^{-1} = 9.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\ \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nD_{AB}^* = 9.000 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\ \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\n### Qualitative Interpretation of the Flux\n\nThe relationship between the averaged molar flux of species $A$ and the gradient of its mole fraction is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_A^* = -c D_{AB}^* \\nabla x_A\n$$\nLet's consider diffusion in one dimension, along a coordinate $z$ normal to the pellet surface and pointing into the pellet. The flux and gradient in this direction are $J_{A,z}^*$ and $\\frac{dx_A}{dz}$, respectively.\n$$\nJ_{A,z}^* = -c D_{AB}^* \\frac{dx_A}{dz}\n$$\nThe problem states that there is a \"negative gradient in $x_A$ normal to the pellet surface\". This means:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_A}{dz}  0\n$$\nThis condition implies that the mole fraction of species $A$ decreases as one moves into the pellet. The concentration of $A$ is higher at the surface (and in the bulk gas) than it is inside the pellet.\n\nThe quantities in the flux equation have the following signs:\n- The total molar concentration $c$ is physically required to be positive ($c>0$).\n- The effective diffusivity $D_{AB}^* = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\tau}D_{AB}$ is a product and ratio of positive physical quantities ($\\epsilon>0$, $\\tau>0$, $D_{AB}>0$), so $D_{AB}^* > 0$.\n\nTherefore, the term $-c D_{AB}^*$ is strictly negative. The sign of the flux $J_{A,z}^*$ is determined by the product of this negative term and the sign of the gradient:\n$$\nJ_{A,z}^* = (-c D_{AB}^*) \\left( \\frac{dx_A}{dz} \\right) = (\\text{negative term}) \\times (\\text{negative value})\n$$\nThe product of two negative numbers is a positive number. Thus, $J_{A,z}^* > 0$.\n\nA positive sign for $J_{A,z}^*$ means that the diffusive molar flux of species $A$ is in the positive $z$-direction. Since the $z$-direction was defined as normal to the surface and pointing *into* the pellet, the flux is directed from the external bulk gas phase into the interior of the catalyst pellet. This is the physically expected result: diffusion occurs spontaneously from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, which is what the negative sign in Fick's law correctly models.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the characteristic diffusion time $t_D$ and characteristic reaction time $t_k$ for a reactant in a spherical catalyst pellet. Subsequently, these time scales must be compared to determine whether the transient approach to a new steady state is diffusion-controlled or reaction-controlled.\n\nFirst, we must ensure all given values are in a consistent set of units. We will use the International System of Units (SI). The pellet radius is given as $R=1.2\\,\\text{mm}$ and the effective diffusivity is $D_{\\text{eff}}=1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}^{2}/\\text{s}$. We convert the radius to meters:\n$$R = 1.2\\,\\text{mm} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$$\n\nNext, we derive the characteristic diffusion time, $t_D$, from first principles. The governing partial differential equation for the transient diffusion of a species with concentration $C$ in a sphere is given by Fick's second law in spherical coordinates:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D_{\\text{eff}} \\left( \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} \\right) \\right)$$\nTo find the characteristic time, we perform a dimensional analysis of this equation. Let $[T]$ denote the dimension of time and $[L]$ denote the dimension of length. The characteristic length scale of the physical domain is the pellet radius, $R$. The time derivative term, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}$, scales as $\\frac{\\Delta C}{t_D}$, where $\\Delta C$ is a characteristic concentration difference and $t_D$ is the characteristic diffusion time. The spatial derivative term, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r}$, scales as $\\frac{\\Delta C}{R}$. The entire right-hand side, representing the net diffusional flux, therefore scales as $D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\Delta C}{R^2}$. For the transient process, the rate of accumulation must balance the rate of diffusion. Equating the scales of the two terms gives:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta C}{t_D} \\sim D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\Delta C}{R^2}$$\nSolving for the characteristic diffusion time $t_D$, we find:\n$$t_D = \\frac{R^2}{D_{\\text{eff}}}$$\nThis quantity represents the time required for a concentration disturbance to propagate across the characteristic length $R$. Using the provided values:\n$$t_D = \\frac{\\left(1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}\\right)^2}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}} = \\frac{1.44 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}^2}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}} = 1.44\\,\\text{s}$$\n\nNow, we derive the characteristic reaction time, $t_k$, from first principles. The problem states that the reaction is first-order with an intrinsic rate constant $k=0.5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$. The rate of consumption of the reactant due to reaction is given by the rate law $r = kC$. The equation describing the change in concentration due to reaction alone is:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC$$\nThe characteristic reaction time $t_k$ is the time scale over which the concentration changes substantially due to the reaction. From the equation, it is evident that $t_k$ is the time constant of the exponential decay. Dimensionally, the left side scales as $\\frac{\\Delta C}{t_k}$ and the right side scales as $k \\Delta C$. Equating these scales:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta C}{t_k} \\sim k \\Delta C$$\nSolving for the characteristic reaction time $t_k$, we obtain:\n$$t_k = \\frac{1}{k}$$\nUsing the given value for the rate constant:\n$$t_k = \\frac{1}{0.5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 2.0\\,\\text{s}$$\n\nFinally, we determine which physical process controls the transient approach to the new state. The controlling process is the one that is slower, meaning it has the longer characteristic time. We compare the calculated values of $t_D$ and $t_k$:\n$$t_D = 1.44\\,\\text{s}$$\n$$t_k = 2.0\\,\\text{s}$$\nSince $t_k > t_D$, the reaction process is slower than the diffusion process. Diffusion is rapid enough to transport reactants throughout the pellet faster than the reaction consumes them. Therefore, the transient behavior and the overall rate of approach to the new steady state are limited by the kinetics of the chemical reaction. The process is reaction-controlled.\n\nThe problem requires a numeric indicator for the control classification: $1$ for diffusion-controlled and $0$ for reaction-controlled.

By comparing the two forms, we identify the square of the effective Thiele modulus, $\\phi_\\mathrm{eff}^2$, as the dimensionless group multiplying $\\psi$:\n$$\n\\phi_\\mathrm{eff}^2 = \\frac{k R^2}{D_e (1+K c^\\ast)}\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the definition of the effective Thiele modulus:\n$$\n\\phi_\\mathrm{eff} = R\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D_e (1+K c^\\ast)}}\n$$\nThis form is dimensionally consistent, as the Thiele modulus must be dimensionless.\nUnits check: $[R]^2 \\frac{[k]}{[D_e][(1+Kc^\\ast)]} \\rightarrow L^2 \\frac{T^{-1}}{L^2 T^{-1} (\\text{dimensionless})} \\rightarrow \\text{dimensionless}$.\n\n**Physical Criterion for Selecting $c^\\ast$**\nThe Thiele modulus compares the characteristic rate of reaction to the characteristic rate of diffusion. The choice of reference concentration $c^\\ast$ should reflect the concentration at which the reaction predominantly occurs. This depends on the operating regime.\n\n-   **Kinetics-Limited Regime:** This regime occurs when diffusion resistance is negligible, which corresponds to small pellets ($R \\rightarrow 0$), high diffusivity ($D_e \\rightarrow \\infty$), or slow kinetics. In this case, the Thiele modulus is small ($\\phi_\\mathrm{eff} \\ll 1$), and the concentration inside the pellet is nearly uniform and equal to the surface concentration, $c(r) \\approx c_s$. Given the problem's assumption of negligible external mass transfer resistance, the surface concentration is equal to the bulk concentration, $c_s = c_b$. Therefore, the reaction occurs throughout the pellet at a concentration of approximately $c_b$. A physically sound choice for the reference concentration is $c^\\ast = c_b$.\n\n-   **Diffusion-Limited Regime:** This regime occurs when reaction is very fast compared to diffusion, corresponding to large pellets ($R \\rightarrow \\infty$), low diffusivity ($D_e \\rightarrow 0$), or fast kinetics. The Thiele modulus is large ($\\phi_\\mathrm{eff} \\gg 1$). The reactant is consumed rapidly near the pellet surface, and its concentration drops to near-zero in the pellet's interior. The reaction is localized in a thin outer shell. The relevant concentration governing this process is the concentration at the surface, $c_s$. Therefore, the appropriate reference concentration is $c^\\ast = c_s$. A high value of $K c_b$ (or $K c_s$) pushes the reaction kinetics towards zero-order ($r \\approx k/K$), which is intrinsically faster than first-order at low concentrations, exacerbating diffusion limitations.\n\n**3. Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**Option A. $\\phi_\\mathrm{eff} = R\\,\\sqrt{\\dfrac{k}{D_e\\,(1+K\\,c^\\ast)}}$, with $c^\\ast$ chosen as $c_b$ (bulk concentration) when pellets are small or $D_e$ is large such that internal concentration gradients are negligible (kinetics-limited), and $c^\\ast$ chosen as $c_s$ (surface concentration) when pellets are large or $K\\,c_b$ is high such that internal gradients are significant and reaction is localized near the surface (diffusion-limited).**\n\n-   **Formula Evaluation:** The formula for $\\phi_\\mathrm{eff}$ matches the one derived from first principles by linearizing the non-dimensional equation as requested.\n-   **Justification Evaluation:** The justification for selecting $c^\\ast$ is physically sound and aligns perfectly with the analysis of the kinetics-limited and diffusion-limited regimes. It correctly identifies the conditions for each regime and assigns the most representative concentration ($c_b$ for kinetics-limited, $c_s$ for diffusion-limited).\n\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**Option B. $\\phi_\\mathrm{eff} = R\\,\\sqrt{\\dfrac{k\\,c^\\ast}{D_e\\,(1+K\\,c^\\ast)}}$, with $c^\\ast$ always chosen as $c_b$ because the external conditions set the scale for reaction regardless of internal gradients.**\n\n-   **Formula Evaluation:** This formula is dimensionally inconsistent. The Thiele modulus must be dimensionless. Let's check the units of the term under the square root:\n$$ \\frac{[k][c^\\ast]}{[D_e]([1]+[K][c^\\ast])} \\rightarrow \\frac{(T^{-1})(M L^{-3})}{(L^2 T^{-1})(1)} = M L^{-5} $$\nThe units of $R^2$ are $L^2$. So $\\phi_\\mathrm{eff}^2$ has units of $M L^{-3}$, which is incorrect.\n-   **Justification Evaluation:** The reasoning that $c^\\ast$ should always be $c_b$ is an oversimplification. In the strongly diffusion-limited regime, the internal reaction physics are governed by the surface concentration $c_s$, not the bulk concentration $c_b$ (even if $c_s=c_b$ due to no external resistance, the conceptual choice of reference for the *internal* problem is $c_s$).\n\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C. $\\phi_\\mathrm{eff} = R\\,\\sqrt{\\dfrac{k}{D_e\\,(1+K\\,c^\\ast)^2}}$, with $c^\\ast$ always chosen as $c_s$ because the kinetics should be linearized using the slope at the surface irrespective of regime.**\n\n-   **Formula Evaluation:** This formula arises from defining an effective first-order rate constant based on the derivative of the rate law, $k_{eff} = dr/dc|_{c^\\ast} = k/(1+Kc^\\ast)^2$. While this is a plausible, alternative definition of a modulus (a \"sensitivity modulus\"), it does not directly follow from the problem's instruction to find a \"pseudo-first-order form\" of the equation, which is more directly achieved by approximating the denominator, leading to the formula in Option A. The definition in A, based on $r(c^\\ast)/c^\\ast$, is more common for defining a modulus that generalizes the first-order case.\n-   **Justification Evaluation:** The justification is too rigid. Insisting on *always* using $c_s$ and *always* using the derivative (slope) is not a universally accepted approach. In the kinetics-limited regime, using $c_b$ is perfectly acceptable and practical, as $c_b \\approx c_s$. The nuanced approach of Option A is physically more adaptable.\n\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D. $\\phi_\\mathrm{eff} = R\\,\\sqrt{\\dfrac{k}{D_e}}$, with $c^\\ast$ chosen as $c_b$ because the non-linearity in $r(c)$ does not affect the Thiele modulus by construction.**\n\n-   **Formula Evaluation:** This is the Thiele modulus for a simple first-order reaction, $r(c) = k c$. It completely ignores the non-linear denominator $(1+Kc)$ from the given rate law.\n-   **Justification Evaluation:** The statement that \"non-linearity in $r(c)$ does not affect the Thiele modulus\" is false. The Thiele modulus is a direct measure of the reaction rate's influence, and the non-linearity is a critical part of the rate law. This simplification is only valid if $K c \\ll 1$, which is not generally true.\n\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
