We are provided with a set of total energies from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.\n\nFirst, we define the total or apparent lateral interaction energy, which we denote as $w_{\\mathrm{raw}}$. This quantity includes all energetic contributions (both direct adsorbate-adsorbate interaction and substrate-mediated effects).

The substrate deformation energy, $E_{\\mathrm{def}}$, is the energy penalty for distorting the clean, relaxed slab into the geometry it adopts in the presence of the adsorbate(s).\n\nFor the case of a single adsorbate, the deformation energy is:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{def},1} = E_{\\mathrm{slab}}^{\\mathrm{frozen},1} - E_{\\mathrm{slab}}^{\\mathrm{rel}}\n$$\nUsing the provided energies:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{def},1} = (-124.800) - (-125.000) = 0.200~\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nFor the case of two adsorbates, the deformation energy is:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{def},2} = E_{\\mathrm{slab}}^{\\mathrm{frozen},2} - E_{\\mathrm{slab}}^{\\mathrm{rel}}\n$$\nUsing the provided energies:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{def},2} = (-124.500) - (-125.000) = 0.500~\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThe non-additive component of the substrate deformation energy, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{def}}$, is the difference between the actual deformation energy for the two-adsorbate system and the sum of the deformation energies for two independent single-adsorbate systems ($2 E_{\\mathrm{def},1}$).\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{def}} = E_{\\mathrm{def},2} - 2 E_{\\mathrm{def},1}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated deformation energies:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{def}} = 0.500 - 2 \\times (0.200) = 0.500 - 0.400 = 0.100~\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThis positive value indicates that deforming the substrate to accommodate two adsorbates costs an extra $0.100~\\mathrm{eV}$ beyond the simple sum of two individual deformations.

Species $A$ and $B$ can occupy sites. Assume pairwise additive, short-range lateral interactions between nearest neighbors and model the surface as a lattice gas in the grand canonical ensemble.

            "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts: first, the derivation of the coverage-induced shift in adsorption energy and its numerical calculation; second, an assessment of the validity of the mean-field approximation used in the derivation.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and Calculation of $\\Delta E_A(\\theta_B)$\n\nThe system consists of species $A$ and $B$ coadsorbed on a surface lattice. We are interested in the adsorption energy of a single species $A$ particle in the presence of a background coverage of species $B$, denoted by $\\theta_B$. The problem defines the coverage-induced shift in the adsorption energy of $A$, $\\Delta E_A(\\theta_B)$, as the change in adsorption energy relative to that of an isolated $A$ adsorbate. This shift arises from the lateral interactions between the $A$ particle and the surrounding $B$ particles.\n\nThe model assumes pairwise additive, short-range interactions limited to nearest neighbors. Let's consider a single $A$ particle adsorbed at a site $i$. Its interaction energy with the surrounding adsorbates is the sum of pairwise interactions with particles on neighboring sites. Since we are considering the limit of a single $A$ particle ($\\theta_A \\to 0$), we only need to account for interactions between the $A$ particle and any $B$ particles on the $z$ nearest-neighbor sites.\n\nLet $\\tau_j$ be an occupation variable for site $j$, where $\\tau_j=1$ if the site is occupied by species $B$ and $\\tau_j=0$ otherwise (i.e., if it is vacant, as we assume $\\theta_A \\to 0$). The interaction energy for a nearest-neighbor $A$–$B$ pair is given as $w_{AB}$. The total interaction energy contribution for the $A$ particle at site $i$ is the sum over its nearest neighbors:\n$$E_{\\text{int}, i} = \\sum_{j \\in \\text{nn}(i)} w_{AB} \\tau_j$$\nwhere $\\text{nn}(i)$ denotes the set of $z$ nearest neighbors of site $i$.\n\nThe quantity $\\Delta E_A(\\theta_B)$ is the ensemble average of this interaction energy:\n$$\\Delta E_A(\\theta_B) = \\langle E_{\\text{int}, i} \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_{j \\in \\text{nn}(i)} w_{AB} \\tau_j \\right\\rangle$$\nBy the linearity of the expectation operator, this becomes:\n$$\\Delta E_A(\\theta_B) = \\sum_{j \\in \\text{nn}(i)} w_{AB} \\langle \\tau_j \\rangle$$\nThe problem specifies the use of a mean-field decoupling. The core assumption of the mean-field approximation is that spatial correlations between adsorbates are neglected. This means the probability of finding a $B$ particle at site $j$ is independent of the occupation state of its neighbors (including site $i$). Therefore, the ensemble average occupation of any site $j$, $\\langle \\tau_j \\rangle$, is simply equal to the macroscopic surface coverage of species $B$, $\\theta_B$.\n$$\\langle \\tau_j \\rangle = \\theta_B \\quad \\text{for all sites } j$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta E_A(\\theta_B)$ and noting that the sum is over $z$ identical terms, we get:\n$$\\Delta E_A(\\theta_B) = \\sum_{j=1}^{z} w_{AB} \\theta_B = z w_{AB} \\theta_B$$\nThis is the derived functional dependence of the adsorption energy shift on the coordination number $z$, the interaction energy $w_{AB}$, and the coverage $\\theta_B$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the given parameters:\n- Coordination number for an FCC$(111)$ surface: $z = 6$.\n- Nearest-neighbor interaction energy: $w_{AB} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- Coverage of species $B$: $\\theta_B = 0.35$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\\Delta E_A = (6) \\times (8.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times (0.35)$$\n$$\\Delta E_A = (48.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times (0.35)$$\n$$\\Delta E_A = 16.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.0168\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $0.01680\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nPart 2: Assessment of the Mean-Field Approximation (MFA)\n\nThe validity of the mean-field approximation for a given physical scenario rests on the extent to which fluctuations and local correlations can be safely neglected. The primary assumption of MFA is that the state of any given particle is determined by the average field created by all other particles, rather than the specific, instantaneous configurations of its immediate neighbors. This can be expressed as $\\langle \\tau_i \\tau_j \\rangle \\approx \\langle \\tau_i \\rangle \\langle \\tau_j \\rangle$ for $i \\neq j$. The validity of this assumption is generally favored under specific conditions, which we assess for this problem.\n\n1.  **Interaction Strength vs. Thermal Energy**: MFA is most accurate when the thermal energy, $k_B T$, is large compared to the characteristic interaction energy, $|w_{AB}|$. This condition, $|w_{AB}| \\ll k_B T$, ensures that thermal fluctuations are strong enough to disrupt the formation of ordered structures and reduce short-range correlations. We are given $T = 600\\,\\text{K}$ and $|w_{AB}| = 8.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. The thermal energy is:\n    $$k_B T = (8.6173 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (600\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.0517\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n    The dimensionless ratio of the interaction energy to the thermal energy is:\n    $$\\frac{|w_{AB}|}{k_B T} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{0.0517\\,\\mathrm{eV}} \\approx 0.155$$\n    Since this ratio is significantly less than $1$, the thermal energy is dominant over the interaction energy. This suggests that the system is likely in a disordered, fluid-like state where neglecting local correlations is a reasonable first approximation. However, the value is not negligibly small, indicating that MFA will be qualitatively correct but may have quantitative inaccuracies.\n\n2.  **Coordination Number and Interaction Range**: MFA becomes formally exact in the limit of infinite-range interactions or an infinite coordination number ($z \\to \\infty$). For the given FCC$(111)$ surface, the interactions are short-range (nearest-neighbor only), but the coordination number is $z=6$. For a two-dimensional lattice, $z=6$ is the highest possible coordination and is considered moderately high. A higher $z$ means each adsorbate interacts with more neighbors, making the local environment more closely resemble the \"mean field\" of the bulk system, thus improving the accuracy of the approximation compared to lattices with lower coordination (e.g., a square lattice with $z=4$).\n\n3.  **Absence of Strong Ordering**: The interaction is repulsive ($w_{AB}  0$), which disfavors clustering of $A$ and $B$ atoms. At certain coverages (e.g., $\\theta = 0.5$ on a square lattice), repulsive interactions can lead to highly ordered checkerboard patterns, where MFA fails dramatically. In this problem, the coverage is $\\theta_B = 0.35$, which is an incommensurate coverage on a triangular lattice that does not favor a simple, long-range ordered ground state. Combined with the high temperature relative to the interaction strength, it is highly probable that the system exists in a disordered phase, far from any ordering transition. MFA is most reliable in such disordered phases.\n\nIn summary, the application of the mean-field approximation to this scenario is justified as a reasonable approximation. The dominant thermal energy ($k_B T \\gg |w_{AB}|$) and the moderately high coordination number ($z=6$) both act to suppress the local correlations that MFA neglects. The system is likely in a disordered phase where a mean-field description captures the leading-order effect of coverage on the adsorption energy.",
