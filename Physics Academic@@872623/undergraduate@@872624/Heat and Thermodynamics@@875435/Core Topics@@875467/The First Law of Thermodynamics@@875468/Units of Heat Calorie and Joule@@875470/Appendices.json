Electrical devices are rated in Watts ($W$), which measure the rate of energy transfer in Joules per second ($J/s$). This practice provides a direct, tangible link between the electrical energy consumed by a simple heater, measured in Joules, and the resulting thermal energy generated, which can be expressed in calories.
