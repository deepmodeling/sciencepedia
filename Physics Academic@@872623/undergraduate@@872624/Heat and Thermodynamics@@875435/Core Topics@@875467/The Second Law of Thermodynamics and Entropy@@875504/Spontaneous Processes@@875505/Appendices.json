The spontaneity of the process is governed by the sign of $\\Delta G$. The relationship between Gibbs free energy, enthalpy ($\\Delta H$), and entropy ($\\Delta S$) is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S\n$$\nA process is spontaneous if $\\Delta G  0$, non-spontaneous if $\\Delta G > 0$, and at equilibrium if $\\Delta G = 0$.\n\nFirst, we identify the given values from the problem statement:\nStandard molar enthalpy of solution, $\\Delta H^\\circ_\\text{soln}$ = +25.7 kJ/mol.\nStandard molar entropy of solution, $\\Delta S^\\circ_\\text{soln}$ = +108.7 J/(mol·K).\nTemperature, T = 25.00 °C.\n\nNext, we must convert the temperature to Kelvin and ensure all energy units are consistent.\nThe temperature in Kelvin is:\n$$\nT = 25.00 + 273.15 = 298.15 \\, \\text{K}\n$$\nThe enthalpy change is given in kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol), while the entropy change is in joules per mole-kelvin (J/(mol·K)). We will convert the entropy change to kJ/(mol·K) to match the units of enthalpy.\n$$\n\\Delta S^\\circ_ \\text{soln} = 108.7 \\, \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{K}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{kJ}}{1000 \\, \\text{J}} = 0.1087 \\, \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{K}}\n$$\nNow we can substitute these values into the Gibbs free energy equation. We are calculating the standard Gibbs free energy of solution ($\\Delta G^\\circ_\\text{soln}$).\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ_\\text{soln} = \\Delta H^\\circ_\\text{soln} - T\\Delta S^\\circ_\\text{soln}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ_\\text{soln} = \\left(+25.7 \\, \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{mol}}\\right) - \\left(298.15 \\, \\text{K} \\times 0.1087 \\, \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{K}}\\right)\n$$\nFirst, calculate the $T\\Delta S^\\circ$ term:\n$$\nT\\Delta S^\\circ_\\text{soln} = 298.15 \\times 0.1087 \\approx 32.41 \\, \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{mol}}\n$$\nNow, substitute this back into the equation for $\\Delta G^\\circ_\\text{soln}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ_\\text{soln} = 25.7 \\, \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{mol}} - 32.41 \\, \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{mol}} = -6.71 \\, \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{mol}}\n$$\nSince $\\Delta G^\\circ_\\text{soln}$ is negative (-6.71 kJ/mol), the dissolution of ammonium nitrate in water at 25.00 °C is a spontaneous process.\n\nNow we must determine the driving force of the reaction.\nThe enthalpy change, $\\Delta H^\\circ_\\text{soln}$, is positive (+25.7 kJ/mol). This means the process is endothermic, absorbing heat from the surroundings. An endothermic process is enthalpically unfavorable, meaning enthalpy opposes the spontaneity.\nThe entropy change, $\\Delta S^\\circ_\\text{soln}$, is positive (+108.7 J/(mol·K)). This means the system becomes more disordered as the solid ammonium nitrate dissolves into ions in solution. An increase in entropy is entropically favorable, meaning entropy promotes the spontaneity.\n\nThe spontaneity of the process ($\\Delta G  0$) is achieved because the favorable entropy term ($-T\\Delta S^\\circ$) is larger in magnitude and negative, overcoming the unfavorable positive enthalpy term ($\\Delta H^\\circ$). Therefore, the dissolution is spontaneous and is primarily driven by the favorable change in entropy.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. The dissolution is spontaneous and primarily driven by the favorable enthalpy change. This is incorrect. The process is spontaneous, but the enthalpy change is unfavorable (endothermic).\nB. The dissolution is spontaneous and primarily driven by the favorable entropy change. This is correct. The process is spontaneous ($\\Delta G  0$), and this is because the large positive $\\Delta S$ makes the $T\\Delta S$ term overcome the positive $\\Delta H$.\nC. The dissolution is non-spontaneous because the process is endothermic. This is incorrect. While the process is endothermic, it is still spontaneous due to the entropy contribution.\nD. The dissolution is non-spontaneous and is opposed by both enthalpy and entropy changes. This is incorrect. The process is spontaneous, and the entropy change is favorable.\nE. The system is at equilibrium at this temperature, and no net dissolution occurs. This is incorrect. The system is only at equilibrium if $\\Delta G = 0$.\n\nThus, the correct statement is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1890980"}, {"introduction": "While some processes are spontaneous under standard conditions, many important industrial reactions are not.
