Initially, a volume $V_1$ of hydrogen gas and a volume $V_2$ of nitrogen gas are held in separate containers. Both containers are at the same constant temperature $T$ and the same pressure $P$.

This change is known as the entropy of mixing.\n\nThe formula for the total entropy of mixing, $\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}}$, for a system of multiple ideal gases is given by statistical thermodynamics as:\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}} = -n_{\\text{total}} R \\sum_{i} x_i \\ln(x_i)\n$$\nwhere $n_{\\text{total}}$ is the total number of moles of gas in the mixture, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $x_i$ is the mole fraction of the $i$-th component gas.\n\nThe problem requires the change in entropy per mole of the final mixture, which is $\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}}}{n_{\\text{total}}}$.
