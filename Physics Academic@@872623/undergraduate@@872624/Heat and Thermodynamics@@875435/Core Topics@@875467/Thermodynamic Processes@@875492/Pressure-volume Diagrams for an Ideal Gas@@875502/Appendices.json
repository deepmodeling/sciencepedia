During this specific process, the pressure $P$ of the gas is found to be a linear function of its volume $V$.

Your final expression should be in terms of the given parameters $P_{1}, V_{1}, P_{2}, V_{2}, C_{V}$, and the universal gas constant $R$.", "solution": "The total heat $Q$ transferred to the gas is governed by the first law of thermodynamics, which states:\n$$Q = \\Delta U + W$$\nwhere $\\Delta U$ is the change in the internal energy of the gas and $W$ is the work done by the gas on its surroundings. We need to calculate both of these quantities.\n\nFirst, let's determine the change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$. For any process involving an ideal gas, the change in internal energy depends only on the change in temperature $\\Delta T = T_2 - T_1$. The formula is:\n$$\\Delta U = n C_V \\Delta T = n C_V (T_2 - T_1)$$\nwhere $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the initial and final temperatures, respectively. We are not given the temperatures directly, but we can express them using the ideal gas law, $PV = nRT$, which implies $T = \\frac{PV}{nR}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta U$:\n$$\\Delta U = n C_V \\left(\\frac{P_2 V_2}{nR} - \\frac{P_1 V_1}{nR}\\right)$$\nThe number of moles $n$ and the gas constant $R$ cancel out from the numerator and denominator, leaving:\n$$\\Delta U = \\frac{C_V}{R} (P_2 V_2 - P_1 V_1)$$\nThis gives us the first part of our required expression.\n\nNext, we calculate the work done by the gas, $W$. The work done by the gas during a volume change from $V_1$ to $V_2$ is given by the integral:\n$$W = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P(V) dV$$\nThe problem states that the pressure $P$ is a linear function of the volume $V$. This means the process path is a straight line on a $P$-$V$ diagram connecting the initial state $(V_1, P_1)$ and the final state $(V_2, P_2)$.\nThe integral for work represents the area under the P-V curve. For a straight-line path, this area is a trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid is given by the average of the parallel sides multiplied by the distance between them.
