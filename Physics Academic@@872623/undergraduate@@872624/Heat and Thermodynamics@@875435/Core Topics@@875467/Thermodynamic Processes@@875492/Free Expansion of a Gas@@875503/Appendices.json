The gas is initially in equilibrium at a pressure $P_i$ and temperature $T_i$. A micrometeoroid unexpectedly punctures this container, allowing the gas to escape and undergo a free expansion, rapidly filling a much larger, pre-evacuated, rigid, and thermally insulated instrument chamber that encloses the original container. The total system (gas, container, and chamber) is isolated from its surroundings.\n\nConsider the overall process from the initial state of the gas confined within the small container to the final equilibrium state where the gas fills the entire chamber.
