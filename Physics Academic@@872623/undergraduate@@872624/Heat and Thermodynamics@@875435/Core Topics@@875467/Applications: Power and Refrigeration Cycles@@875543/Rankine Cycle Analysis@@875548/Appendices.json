Let's denote the state at the pump inlet as state 1 and the state at the pump outlet as state 2.\n\nThe specific work input to a steady-flow device like a pump can be determined from the steady-flow energy equation, which, for a control volume enclosing the pump, is:\n$$w_{\\text{in}} + h_1 + \\frac{V_1^2}{2} + gz_1 = h_2 + \\frac{V_2^2}{2} + gz_2 + q_{\\text{out}}$$\nFor an ideal pump, the process is assumed to be adiabatic ($q_{\\text{out}} = 0$). Changes in kinetic energy ($\\Delta V^2/2$) and potential energy ($g\\Delta z$) across the pump are typically negligible compared to the enthalpy change. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n$$w_{\\text{in}} \\approx h_2 - h_1$$\nHere, $w_{\\text{in}}$ is the specific work input to the pump, and $h_1$ and $h_2$ are the specific enthalpies at the inlet and outlet, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that the pumping process is internally reversible. For an internally reversible process, one of the fundamental thermodynamic property relations is given by:\n$$Tds = dh - vdP$$\nwhere $T$ is temperature, $s$ is specific entropy, $h$ is specific enthalpy, $v$ is specific volume, and $P$ is pressure. For an internally reversible and adiabatic process (an isentropic process), the change in specific entropy is zero ($ds = 0$). Therefore, the relation simplifies to:\n$$dh = vdP$$\nTo find the total enthalpy change from state 1 to state 2, we integrate this expression:\n$$h_2 - h_1 = \\int_{1}^{2} v dP$$\nThe problem also states that the liquid water can be treated as an incompressible substance. This means its specific volume $v$ is constant during the pumping process. The constant specific volume is equal to the specific volume at the pump inlet (state 1), which is the specific volume of saturated liquid at the condenser pressure, $v_1$.\n$$v = v_1 = \\text{constant}$$\nWith $v$ being constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n$$h_2 - h_1 = v_1 \\int_{P_1}^{P_2} dP = v_1(P_2 - P_1)$$\nTherefore, the specific work input to the pump is:\n$$w_{\\text{in}} = v_1(P_2 - P_1)$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Specific volume at inlet, $v_1 = 0.001014 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{kg}$\n- Inlet pressure (condenser pressure), $P_1 = 15 \\text{ kPa}$\n- Outlet pressure (boiler pressure), $P_2 = 4.0 \\text{ MPa}$\n\nBefore substituting the values, we must ensure the pressures are in consistent units. We convert megapascal (MPa) to kilopascal (kPa):\n$$P_2 = 4.0 \\text{ MPa} = 4.0 \\times 1000 \\text{ kPa} = 4000 \\text{ kPa}$$\nNow we can substitute the numerical values into the equation for the pump work:\n$$w_{\\text{in}} = (0.001014 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{kg}) \\times (4000 \\text{ kPa} - 15 \\text{ kPa})$$\n$$w_{\\text{in}} = (0.001014 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{kg}) \\times (3985 \\text{ kPa})$$\nThe resulting unit is $\\text{kPa} \\cdot \\text{m}^3/\\text{kg}$.
