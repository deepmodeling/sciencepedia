This problem challenges you to think about system size in a different way—by changing its horizontal extent rather than simply adding more substance to a fixed volume. You will analyze pressure and weight in a column of fluid, reinforcing your understanding that some properties depend on local conditions (like depth) while others depend on the total quantity of matter [@problem_id:1861393].", "problem": "Consider a system, which we will call System 1, consisting of an open-topped cylindrical container of cross-sectional area $A$ and height $H$. The container is filled to the brim with an incompressible fluid of uniform density $\\rho$. This system is located on a planet where the gravitational acceleration is a constant $g$ and the atmospheric pressure at the fluid's surface is $P_{0}$.\n\nWe are interested in two physical quantities associated with this system:\n1.  $Q_P$: The absolute pressure at the very bottom center of the container.\n2.  $Q_W$: The total weight of the fluid inside the container.\n\nNow, imagine an identical system, System 2, with the same container dimensions, fluid, and environmental conditions. These two systems are then combined by placing them side-by-side and removing the internal wall between them. This creates a new, larger system (System 3) that is a cylinder of height $H$ but with a cross-sectional area of $2A$, also filled with the same fluid.\n\nBased on how the quantities $Q_P$ and $Q_W$ for System 3 compare to those for System 1, classify each quantity as either extensive or intensive.\n\nA. $Q_P$ is extensive, and $Q_W$ is extensive.\n\nB. $Q_P$ is extensive, and $Q_W$ is intensive.\n\nC. $Q_P$ is intensive, and $Q_W$ is extensive.\n\nD. $Q_P$ is intensive, and $Q_W$ is intensive.\n\nE.
