By analyzing a controlled phase transition, you will calculate temperature directly from its definition, $\\Delta S = Q_{rev}/T$ [@problem_id:1896572].", "problem": "A novel metallic alloy is being tested for its thermodynamic properties. The alloy is designed to have a sharp phase transition at a specific temperature. In an experiment, a sample of this alloy is kept in perfect thermal contact with a large heat reservoir, allowing for a controlled and very slow phase transition. This process is slow enough to be considered perfectly reversible and isothermal. During the transition, a carefully measured amount of heat, $Q = 50$ J, is absorbed by the sample from the reservoir. Concurrently, the entropy of the sample is measured to increase by an amount $\\Delta S = 0.2$ J/K. Based on these experimental data, calculate the thermodynamic temperature, $T$, at which this phase transition occurs.
