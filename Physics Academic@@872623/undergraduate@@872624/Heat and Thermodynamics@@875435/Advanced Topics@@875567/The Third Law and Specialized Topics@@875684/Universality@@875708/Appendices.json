This practice [@problem_id:1903284] presents a powerful thought experiment comparing a one-dimensional chain of interacting elements to a three-dimensional lattice. Your task is to construct a free-energy argument that explains why a stable ordered phase can exist at low temperatures in 3D but not in 1D, providing a deep insight into why dimensionality is a key determinant of a system's critical behavior.", "problem": "Consider a system composed of a large number of elements arranged on a lattice. Each element can exist in one of two states, A or B. The system has a local interaction such that the energy of the system is increased by a fixed amount $J > 0$ for every pair of adjacent elements that are in different states. The lowest energy state, or ground state, of the system is the \"ordered phase\" where all elements are in the same state (e.g., all A). At a non-zero temperature $T$, thermal fluctuations can cause some elements to flip their state, creating \"domains\" of one state within a sea of the other. A macroscopic phase transition from the ordered phase to a disordered phase occurs at a critical temperature $T_c$ if the ordered phase is thermodynamically stable for all temperatures $0 < T < T_c$.\n\nNow, compare two different arrangements of these elements: a one-dimensional (1D) linear chain and a three-dimensional (3D) simple cubic lattice. Experimental evidence and theoretical models suggest that for such a system, a phase transition can occur at a finite, non-zero temperature ($T_c > 0$) in the 3D case, but not in the 1D case (meaning $T_c = 0$ for 1D).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct physical argument for this difference in behavior based on a free energy analysis?\n\nA. The total number of elements in a 3D lattice is vastly greater than in a 1D chain, so the collective interaction energy in 3D is strong enough to resist thermal disorder, a feat not possible for the fewer interactions in 1D.\n\nB. In 1D, the energy required to create a disordered domain of length $L$ scales with $L$, while the associated entropy is constant. In 3D, the energy to create a domain of size $L$ scales with $L^3$, while its entropy scales with $L^2$. The much faster-growing energy cost in 3D stabilizes its order.\n\nC. In 1D, creating a single boundary (a domain wall) between ordered regions has a constant energy cost, independent of the system's size, while the entropy associated with the wall's position grows with the size of the system. In 3D, the energy cost of a domain wall grows with its surface area. This area-dependent energy cost can be large enough at low temperatures to suppress the creation of domains.\n\nD. The coordination number (number of nearest neighbors) is much lower in 1D (2) than in 3D (6). This means that in 1D, a single thermal fluctuation is more likely to be sufficient to flip an element's state, leading to a cascade that instantly destroys any long-range order at any non-zero temperature.\n\nE. In both dimensions, the free energy cost to create a single flipped element is the same. However, in 3D, such a defect is \"caged\" by its neighbors, preventing it from moving and expanding. In 1D, the defect can move freely along the chain, effectively leading to a gaseous phase of defects that disorders the system.", "solution": "We analyze the stability of the ordered phase via the free energy balance between energetic cost and entropic gain for creating domain walls (interfaces between A and B domains). The relevant thermodynamic relation is the free energy definition\n$$\nF = E - T S,\n$$\nand the entropy is computed from the number of microstates as\n$$\nS = k_{B} \\ln \\Omega,\n$$\nwhere $\\Omega$ is the number of distinct configurations corresponding to the excitation.\n\nFirst consider a one-dimensional chain of $N$ elements with nearest-neighbor interactions in which each unlike adjacent pair contributes an energy increase $J>0$ relative to a like pair. A single domain wall (a boundary between regions of opposite state) introduces exactly one unlike pair, so its energy cost is constant:\n$$\nE_{\\text{1D, one wall}} = J.\n$$\nTo create a finite domain of reversed elements in a ring (periodic boundary conditions), two domain walls are required, giving a constant energy cost independent of the system size:\n$$\nE_{\\text{1D, two walls}} = 2J.\n$$\nThe number of distinct placements of two domain walls on $N$ bonds scales as $\\Omega \\sim \\binom{N}{2} \\sim \\frac{N^{2}}{2}$ for large $N$, so the entropy gain is\n$$\nS_{\\text{1D}} = k_{B} \\ln \\Omega \\approx 2 k_{B} \\ln N + \\text{const}.\n$$\nThe corresponding free energy change to create a domain is\n$$\n\\Delta F_{\\text{1D}} = 2J - T S_{\\text{1D}} \\approx 2J - 2 k_{B} T \\ln N + \\text{const}.\n$$\nFor any fixed $T>0$, as $N$ increases, the term $-2 k_{B} T \\ln N$ dominates, so $\\Delta F_{\\text{1D}}<0$ for sufficiently large $N$. Hence, domain walls proliferate at any nonzero temperature, destroying long-range order. This implies $T_{c}=0$ in one dimension.\n\nNow consider a three-dimensional simple cubic lattice. Create a compact domain (droplet) of the minority phase with linear size $L$ (in lattice units). The energetic cost is due to the interface between the two phases. The number of unlike adjacent pairs scales with the surface area of the droplet, so the energy cost is\n$$\nE_{\\text{3D}}(L) = \\sigma L^{2},\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is an interface tension proportional to $J$ and depends on lattice geometry but is a positive constant at low $T$. The entropy has two main contributions: a translational entropy from placing the droplet in the system (which contributes at most $k_{B}\\ln N_{\\text{sites}}$, independent of $L$) and a configurational or interfacial entropy associated with possible roughness/shape fluctuations of the interface, which scales at most proportionally to the area,\n$$\nS_{\\text{3D}}(L) \\leq s L^{2} + k_{B}\\ln N_{\\text{sites}},\n$$\nwith $s$ a finite interfacial entropy density. Therefore, the free energy change behaves as\n$$\n\\Delta F_{\\text{3D}}(L) \\geq \\left(\\sigma - T s\\right)L^{2} - k_{B} T \\ln N_{\\text{sites}}.\n$$\nAt sufficiently low $T$, one has $\\sigma - T s > 0$, and the leading term grows as $L^{2}$, so $\\Delta F_{\\text{3D}}(L)$ is positive and increases with $L$. Large domains are thereby exponentially suppressed, and the ordered phase is thermodynamically stable. As $T$ increases, there can be a critical temperature $T_{c}>0$ at which the effective interfacial tension vanishes, leading to proliferation of interfaces and a phase transition.\n\nThis free-energy argument demonstrates:\n- In 1D: a domain wall has constant energy cost while its positional entropy grows with system size, making $\\Delta F$ negative at any $T>0$ in the thermodynamic limit. No finite-temperature ordered phase exists.\n- In 3D: a domain wall costs energy proportional to its area, while its entropy grows no faster than proportionally to area, yielding a positive free-energy cost for sufficiently low $T$ and thus a stable ordered phase with $T_{c}>0$.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the energy cost of a droplet in zero external field scales with surface area $L^{2}$, not volume $L^{3}$. Options A, D, and E do not provide the correct free-energy scaling argument.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1903284"}]}
