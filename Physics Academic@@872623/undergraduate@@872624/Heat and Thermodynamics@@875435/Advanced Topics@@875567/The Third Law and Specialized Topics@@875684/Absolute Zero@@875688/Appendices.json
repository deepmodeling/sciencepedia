The relationship between pressure, volume, temperature, and the amount of gas is given by the Ideal Gas Law:\n$$PV = nRT$$\nwhere $P$ is the pressure, $V$ is the volume, $n$ is the number of moles of the gas, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nIn this scenario, the thermometer is a \"constant-volume\" device, which means the volume $V$ of the gas is fixed. Additionally, the amount of gas inside the sealed thermometer is constant, so the number of moles $n$ is also fixed. The ideal gas constant $R$ is a universal constant. We can rearrange the Ideal Gas Law to group the constant terms:\n$$\\frac{P}{T} = \\frac{nR}{V}$$\nSince $n$, $R$, and $V$ are all constant for this thermometer, the ratio $\\frac{nR}{V}$ is a constant.
