The effectiveness of this method relies on the specific thermodynamic properties of a paramagnetic salt.\n\nConsider a hypothetical paramagnetic salt being investigated for this purpose. Unlike typical paramagnetic materials which obey Curie's Law, this salt has an unusual property: its magnetization, $M$, is a function of the applied external magnetic field, $B$, but is completely independent of the temperature, $T$.

Starting from an initial state with zero magnetic field at temperature $T_i$, the salt is held in thermal contact with a large heat reservoir that maintains a constant temperature $T_i$. The magnetic field is slowly increased from $B=0$ to a final value $B=B_f$.\n2.  After reaching the state $(T_i, B_f)$, the salt is thermally isolated from the reservoir.
