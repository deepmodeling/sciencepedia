Periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the crystal. In the Debye model for this system, it is assumed that there is a finite number of vibrational modes, equal to the number of atoms, $N$. Based on this, there exists a cutoff frequency, $\\omega_D$ (the Debye frequency), such that no modes exist for $\\omega > \\omega_D$.
