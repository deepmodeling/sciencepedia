Unlike classical particles, identical bosons cannot be individually tracked, which fundamentally changes how we count the possible arrangements, or microstates, of a system. This exercise provides a foundational practice in this new way of counting, which is essential for deriving the Bose-Einstein distribution [@problem_id:1845474]. By working through a simple system of a few particles and energy levels, you will gain a concrete understanding of the combinatorial rules that govern the bosonic world.", "problem": "Consider a simplified quantum mechanical model of a system containing a small number of particles. The system consists of 3 identical and indistinguishable bosonic particles. These particles are to be distributed among 4 distinct and discrete energy levels. A microstate of the system is a specific arrangement of the particles in these energy levels. For example, one possible microstate is having all 3 particles in the first energy level and the other three levels empty. Another microstate is having one particle in each of the first three levels and the fourth level empty. Determine the total number of distinct microstates possible for this system.", "solution": "Because the particles are identical bosons and the energy levels are distinct, a microstate is completely specified by the occupation numbers of the levels. Let the occupation numbers be $(n_{1},n_{2},n_{3},n_{4})$ with $n_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ and subject to the constraint\n$$\nn_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}+n_{4}=3.\n$$\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of weak compositions of $3$ into $4$ parts. By the stars-and-bars theorem, the number of solutions is\n$$\n\\binom{N+g-1}{g-1},\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the total number of indistinguishable particles and $g$ is the number of distinct levels. Substituting $N=3$ and $g=4$ gives\n$$\n\\binom{3+4-1}{4-1}=\\binom{6}{3}=\\frac{6!}{3!\\,3!}=20.\n$$\nTherefore, the total number of distinct microstates is $20$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "1845474"}, {"introduction": "Once the rules for counting microstates are established, we can derive the Bose-Einstein distribution function.
