For a non-isothermal process, the ideal gas law is no longer a valid approximation, which is a necessary condition for the Maxwell construction to hold.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the correct thermodynamic basis of the Maxwell construction. For a pure substance at phase coexistence, the equilibrium condition is equality of chemical potentials of the two phases, i.e., equality of the molar Gibbs free energy:\n$$\ng^{\\ell}(T,P)=g^{g}(T,P).\n$$\nThe differential of the molar Gibbs free energy is\n$$\ndg = v\\,dP - s\\,dT,\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the molar volume and $s$ is the molar entropy. Along an isotherm, $dT=0$, so\n$$\ndg\\big|_{T} = v\\,dP.\n$$\nConsider a van der Waals isotherm at fixed $T$ that exhibits a mechanically unstable portion. The Maxwell equal-area rule determines the saturation pressure $P_{\\text{sat}}(T)$ by enforcing the coexistence condition $g^{\\ell}(T,P_{\\text{sat}})=g^{g}(T,P_{\\text{sat}})$.

Along a general path with $dT\\neq 0$, the Gibbs differential is\n$$\ndg = v\\,dP - s\\,dT,\n$$\nso the coexistence condition between two states at different temperatures does not reduce to a simple relation involving only $\\int v\\,dP$ (or only areas in the $P$–$V$ plane).

A process with changing temperature can be reversible; irreversibility is not the fundamental issue here.\n\nC. Correct. The Maxwell construction derives from the equilibrium condition $g^{\\ell}=g^{g}$ and reduces to the equal-area rule only when $dT=0$ (constant temperature). For non-isothermal paths, the $-s\\,dT$ term prevents any equal-area statement in the $P$–$V$ plane from encoding phase equilibrium.\n\nD. Incorrect. Although one can also derive the common-tangent construction from the Helmholtz free energy at fixed $T$, the fundamental coexistence condition is equality of Gibbs free energies at given $T$ and $P$.
