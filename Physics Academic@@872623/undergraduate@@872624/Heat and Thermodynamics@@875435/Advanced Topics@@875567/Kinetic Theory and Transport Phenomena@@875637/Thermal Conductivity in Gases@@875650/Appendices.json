The heat flux, denoted by $J$, is the rate of heat transfer per unit area.\n\nLet's orient our coordinate system such that the hot plate is at position $x=0$ and the cold plate is at position $x=L$. The temperature at a position $x$ is denoted by $T(x)$. So, we have the boundary conditions $T(0) = T_h$ and $T(L) = T_c$.\n\nThe fundamental equation for heat conduction is Fourier's law, which states that the heat flux $J$ is proportional to the negative of the temperature gradient:\n$$J = -k(T) \\frac{dT}{dx}$$\nIn steady state, the heat flux $J$ must be constant for all $x$ between $0$ and $L$. If it were not constant, heat would accumulate or be depleted in some region of the gas, and the temperature would change over time, contradicting the steady-state assumption.\n\nWe are given that the thermal conductivity $k(T)$ is a function of temperature:\n$$k(T) = \\alpha \\sqrt{T}$$\nSubstituting this into Fourier's law, we get:\n$$J = -\\alpha \\sqrt{T} \\frac{dT}{dx}$$\nSince $J$ and $\\alpha$ are constants, we can solve this differential equation by separating variables.
