Let the argument of the function $f$ be $u = kz - \\omega t$.\n\n**Step 1: Test Gauss's Law for Electricity ($\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = 0$)**\n\nThe divergence of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ in Cartesian coordinates is given by $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial z}$.\nFor the given field, $E_x=0$, $E_y=0$, and $E_z = E_0 f(kz - \\omega t)$.\nThe divergence is therefore:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left[ E_0 f(kz - \\omega t) \\right] $$\nUsing the chain rule, where $f'(u)$ is the derivative of $f$ with respect to its argument $u$:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = E_0 f'(u) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = E_0 f'(kz - \\omega t) \\cdot k = k E_0 f'(kz - \\omega t) $$\nSince the waveform $f$ is non-constant, its derivative $f'(u)$ is not identically zero. Also, for a wave to exist, $k \\neq 0$ and $E_0 \\neq 0$. Thus, $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} \\neq 0$.\nThis means the proposed electric field violates Gauss's Law for electricity in a vacuum. This immediately eliminates options A, C, and E.\n\n**Step 2: Test the Curl-based Laws (Faraday's and Ampere-Maxwell)**\n\nFirst, let's analyze Faraday's Law of Induction: $\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}$. We need to compute the curl of $\\vec{E}$.\nThe curl of $\\vec{E}$ in Cartesian coordinates is:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial z}\\right)\\hat{x} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial x}\\right)\\hat{y} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial y}\\right)\\hat{z} $$\nSince $E_x = E_y = 0$ and $E_z$ is a function of only $z$ and $t$, the derivatives $\\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial y}$ are both zero.\nTherefore, every component of the curl is zero:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = \\vec{0} $$\nFor Faraday's Law ($\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}$) to be satisfied, we must have $-\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t} = \\vec{0}$. This implies that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ must be static (i.e., time-independent), so $\\vec{B} = \\vec{B}(\\vec{r})$. Faraday's Law itself is not necessarily violated; it simply imposes a condition on $\\vec{B}$.\n\n**Step 3: Test the Ampere-Maxwell Law ($\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t}$)**\n\nNow let's examine the consistency with the Ampere-Maxwell Law. A fundamental theorem of vector calculus states that the divergence of the curl of any vector field is identically zero. That is, for any vector field $\\vec{A}$, $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\vec{A}) = 0$.\nIf the Ampere-Maxwell Law a is to hold, then the divergence of its right-hand side must also be zero:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t}\\right) = 0 $$\nLet's compute the time derivative of $\\vec{E}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ E_0 f(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z} \\right] = E_0 f'(u) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\hat{z} = -\\omega E_0 f'(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z} $$\nNow, let's take the divergence of this expression:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t}\\right) = \\nabla \\cdot \\left[ -\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\omega E_0 f'(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z} \\right] $$\n$$ = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left[ -\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\omega E_0 f'(kz - \\omega t) \\right] $$\nApplying the chain rule again, where $f''(u)$ is the second derivative:\n$$ = -\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\omega E_0 f''(u) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = -\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\omega k E_0 f''(kz - \\omega t) $$\nSince the wave profile $f(u)$ is arbitrary and non-constant, its second derivative $f''(u)$ is not generally zero. All other constants are non-zero.\nThus, $\\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t}\\right) \\neq 0$.\nThis leads to a contradiction. The Ampere-Maxwell Law requires $\\nabla \\times \\vec{B}$ to be equal to a vector field whose divergence is non-zero. However, the divergence of a curl is always zero. This means it is mathematically impossible to find any vector field $\\vec{B}$ that satisfies the Ampere-Maxwell Law for the given $\\vec{E}$. The law is therefore fundamentally violated.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe proposed electric field violates Gauss's Law for electricity because its divergence is non-zero. It also violates the Ampere-Maxwell law because the right-hand side, $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial\\vec{E}}{\\partial t}$, has a non-zero divergence and thus cannot be represented as the curl of any magnetic field $\\vec{B}$.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1592426"}, {"introduction": "Having established that EM waves are transverse, we now explore the specific geometric relationships this imposes on the field vectors, especially when the wave propagates in an arbitrary direction.

First, the electric field vector is always perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Second, the magnitudes of the electric and magnetic field amplitudes are related by the speed of light.\n\nStep 1: Apply the transversality condition.\nFor an electromagnetic plane wave, the electric field vector $\\vec{E}$ is transverse to the direction of propagation, which is given by the wave vector $\\vec{k}$. This orthogonality condition is expressed as $\\vec{E} \\cdot \\vec{k} = 0$. This relationship must hold for the amplitude vectors as well, so we have $\\vec{E}_0 \\cdot \\vec{k} = 0$.\n\nThe problem provides the wave vector $\\vec{k} = k_0(3\\hat{x} + 4\\hat{z})$ and states that the electric field amplitude vector $\\vec{E}_0$ has no $y$-component. Therefore, we can write $\\vec{E}_0$ as $\\vec{E}_0 = E_x \\hat{x} + E_z \\hat{z}$.\n\nNow, we compute the dot product:\n$$ \\vec{E}_0 \\cdot \\vec{k} = (E_x \\hat{x} + E_z \\hat{z}) \\cdot (k_0(3\\hat{x} + 4\\hat{z})) = 0 $$\n$$ k_0 ((E_x)(3) + (E_z)(4)) = 0 $$\n$$ k_0 (3E_x + 4E_z) = 0 $$\nSince $k_0$ is a positive constant, it is non-zero. Thus, the term in the parentheses must be zero:\n$$ 3E_x + 4E_z = 0 $$\nThis equation gives us a relationship between the $x$ and $z$ components of the electric field amplitude. We can express $E_z$ in terms of $E_x$:\n$$ E_z = -\\frac{3}{4} E_x $$\n\nStep 2: Relate the electric and magnetic field amplitudes.\nFor a plane electromagnetic wave in a vacuum, the magnitudes of the electric field amplitude, $E_0 = |\\vec{E}_0|$, and the magnetic field amplitude, $B_0 = |\\vec{B}_0|$, are related by the speed of light, $c$:\n$$ E_0 = c B_0 $$\nThe problem states that the magnetic field amplitude is $B_0$. We need to find an expression for $E_0$ in terms of the component $E_x$.\n\nThe electric field amplitude vector is $\\vec{E}_0 = E_x \\hat{x} + E_z \\hat{z}$. We can find its magnitude, $E_0$, using the relationship derived in Step 1:\n$$ E_0 = |\\vec{E}_0| = \\sqrt{E_x^2 + E_z^2} $$\nSubstitute $E_z = -\\frac{3}{4} E_x$ into this expression:\n$$ E_0 = \\sqrt{E_x^2 + \\left(-\\frac{3}{4} E_x\\right)^2} $$\n$$ E_0 = \\sqrt{E_x^2 + \\frac{9}{16} E_x^2} $$\n$$ E_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{16} E_x^2 + \\frac{9}{16} E_x^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16} E_x^2} $$\nTaking the square root gives:\n$$ E_0 = \\frac{5}{4} \\sqrt{E_x^2} = \\frac{5}{4} |E_x| $$\n\nStep 3: Combine the results to find the final answer.\nWe now have two expressions for $E_0$: $E_0 = c B_0$ and $E_0 = \\frac{5}{4} |E_x|$. We can set them equal to each other:\n$$ \\frac{5}{4} |E_x| = c B_0 $$\nFinally, we solve for the magnitude of the $x$-component of the electric field amplitude, $|E_x|$:\n$$ |E_x| = \\frac{4}{5} c B_0 $$\nThis provides the required expression in terms of the given parameters $B_0$ and $c$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5} c B_0}$$", "id": "1626765"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves from understanding the fundamental properties of waves to constructing and using their mathematical descriptions in a practical scenario.
