The experiment is conducted in a laboratory where the surrounding medium is air, which has a refractive index of $n_{air} = 1.00$. In the experiment, a laser beam is directed at normal incidence (perpendicularly) onto a flat surface of a sample of each material. The power reflectance, defined as the ratio of the reflected power to the incident power, is measured for each material. The measurement reveals that the reflectance from the air-A interface, $R_A$, is greater than the reflectance from the air-B interface, $R_B$. It is known from preliminary measurements that the refractive indices of both materials, $n_A$ and $n_B$, are greater than the refractive index of air.\n\nBased on this experimental observation, which of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between the refractive indices $n_A$ and $n_B$?\n\nA. $n_A > n_B$\n\nB. $n_B > n_A$\n\nC. $n_A = n_B$\n\nD. $n_A n_B = 1$\n\nE.

The relationship depends on whether the laser light is s-polarized or p-polarized.", "solution": "We use the Fresnel equations for reflection at a planar interface between two non-magnetic, isotropic, transparent dielectrics. For normal incidence from a medium with refractive index $n_{1}$ into a medium with refractive index $n_{2}$, the field reflection coefficient is\n$$\nr=\\frac{n_{1}-n_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}},\n$$\nindependent of polarization at normal incidence, and the power reflectance is\n$$\nR=|r|^{2}=\\left(\\frac{n_{1}-n_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\n\nIn the experiment, light is incident from air with refractive index $n_{air}$ onto a material with refractive index $n$.

The observation $R_{A}R_{B}$ then implies\n$$\nn_{A}n_{B}.\n$$\n\nThis conclusion is independent of polarization because at normal incidence the Fresnel reflection is the same for s and p polarizations. The wavelength need not be specified to determine the ordering, since for a fixed measurement wavelength the reflectance depends only on the index value at that wavelength, and the monotonic dependence ensures that larger reflectance corresponds to larger refractive index.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is $n_{A}n_{B}$.\n\nIncorrect options:\n- $n_{B}n_{A}$ contradicts the monotonicity.\n- $n_{A}=n_{B}$ would give equal reflectances, not $R_{A}R_{B}$.\n- $n_{A}n_{B}=1$ is unrelated to the observed reflectances.\n- The wavelength is not required for the ordering at the measurement wavelength.\n- Polarization does not matter at normal incidence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1800002"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics, we now move to the more general case of oblique incidence, a scenario common in technologies like remote sensing.
