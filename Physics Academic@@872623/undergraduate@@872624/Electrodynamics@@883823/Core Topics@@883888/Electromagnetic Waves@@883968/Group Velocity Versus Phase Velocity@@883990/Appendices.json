One such type, known as a whistler wave, exhibits interesting dispersive properties. In a simplified one-dimensional model for a specific propagation mode and frequency range within a magnetoplasma, the group velocity $v_g$ of a wave packet is observed to be directly proportional to its wavenumber $k$.
