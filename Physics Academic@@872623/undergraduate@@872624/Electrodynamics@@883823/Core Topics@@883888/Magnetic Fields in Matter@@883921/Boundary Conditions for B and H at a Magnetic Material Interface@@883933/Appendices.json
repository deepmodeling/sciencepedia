This is a boundary value problem in magnetostatics. The solution involves applying the boundary conditions for magnetic fields at the interface between two linear magnetic materials.\n\nThe relationship between the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ and the magnetic field intensity $\\vec{H}$ in a linear, isotropic, and homogeneous material with magnetic permeability $\\mu$ is given by $\\vec{B} = \\mu \\vec{H}$.\n\nThe boundary conditions at the interface ($z=0$) between two magnetic materials in the absence of free surface currents ($\\vec{K}_f = 0$) are:\n1. The normal component of the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is continuous across the interface: $B_{1,\\perp} = B_{2,\\perp}$.\n2. The tangential component of the magnetic field intensity $\\vec{H}$ is continuous across the interface: $\\vec{H}_{1,\\parallel} = \\vec{H}_{2,\\parallel}$.\n\nThe interface is the plane $z=0$. The unit vector normal to this interface is $\\hat{n} = \\hat{z}$.\nTherefore, the component of any vector field parallel to the $z$-axis is the normal component, and the components in the $xy$-plane are the tangential components.\n\nLet's denote the magnetic field in Region 2 as $\\vec{B}_2 = B_{2,x}\\hat{x} + B_{2,y}\\hat{y} + B_{2,z}\\hat{z}$ and the magnetic field intensity as $\\vec{H}_2 = H_{2,x}\\hat{x} + H_{2,y}\\hat{y} + H_{2,z}\\hat{z}$.\n\nFirst, we apply the boundary condition for the normal component of $\\vec{B}$. The normal component in Region 1 is the $z$-component of $\\vec{B}_1$.\nFrom the given expression $\\vec{B}_1 = C_x \\hat{x} + C_z \\hat{z}$, we have $B_{1,z} = C_z$.\nSo, $B_{1,\\perp} = B_{1,z} = C_z$.\nAccording to the boundary condition, $B_{2,\\perp} = B_{1,\\perp}$. This means the normal component of $\\vec{B}_2$ is:\n$$B_{2,z} = C_z$$\n\nNext, we apply the boundary condition for the tangential components of $\\vec{H}$.

This means the tangential components are continuous:\n$H_{2,x} = H_{1,x} = \\frac{C_x}{\\mu_1}$\n$H_{2,y} = H_{1,y} = 0$\n\nWe now have the tangential components of $\\vec{H}_2$. We still need to find the normal component, $H_{2,z}$.\nWe can find $H_{2,z}$ by using the constitutive relation in Region 2, $\\vec{B}_2 = \\mu_2 \\vec{H}_2$, which implies $B_{2,z} = \\mu_2 H_{2,z}$.\nWe have already found that $B_{2,z} = C_z$. Therefore:\n$$H_{2,z} = \\frac{B_{2,z}}{\\mu_2} = \\frac{C_z}{\\mu_2}$$\n\nCombining all the components, we get the expression for the magnetic field intensity in Region 2:\n$$\\vec{H}_2 = \\frac{C_x}{\\mu_1}\\hat{x} + 0\\hat{y} + \\frac{C_z}{\\mu_2}\\hat{z}$$\nThe components asked for are $(H_{2,x}, H_{2,y}, H_{2,z})$.\n$H_{2,x} = \\frac{C_x}{\\mu_1}$\n$H_{2,y} = 0$\n$H_{2,z} = \\frac{C_z}{\\mu_2}$\n\nSo the ordered triplet is $(\\frac{C_x}{\\mu_1}, 0, \\frac{C_z}{\\mu_2})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{C_x}{\\mu_1}  0  \\frac{C_z}{\\mu_2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1568390"}, {"introduction": "Scientific and engineering analysis often involves validating data and models against fundamental principles.
