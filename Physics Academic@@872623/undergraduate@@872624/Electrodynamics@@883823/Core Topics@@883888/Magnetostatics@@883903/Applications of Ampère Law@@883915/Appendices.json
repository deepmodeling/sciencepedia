We can solve this using Ampère's Law, which relates the line integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop to the total current enclosed by that loop.\n\nAmpère's Law is given by:\n$$ \\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{enc} $$\n\nFirst, we establish the symmetry of the magnetic field. Given the cylindrical symmetry of the current distribution (it only depends on the radial distance $r$), the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ must also be cylindrically symmetric. The magnetic field lines will form concentric circles centered on the axis of the conductor, and the magnitude of the field, $B$, will only be a function of the radial distance $r$. At any point on such a circle, $\\vec{B}$ is tangential to the circle.\n\nWe choose an Amperian loop to be a circle of radius $r$ (where $r  R$), concentric with the conductor's axis. For this loop, the magnetic field vector $\\vec{B}$ is everywhere parallel to the line element vector $d\\vec{l}$.
