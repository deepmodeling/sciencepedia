## Introduction
The conservation of momentum is a foundational tenet of physics, providing a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of closed systems. In classical mechanics, this principle is a direct consequence of Newton's third law. However, when applied to charged particles interacting through electromagnetic forces, which propagate at a finite speed, this simple picture falters. The forces between two charges are not instantaneously equal and opposite, leading to an apparent violation of momentum conservation. This article addresses this crucial paradox by expanding the concept of a "system" to include the electromagnetic field itself.

This exploration is structured into three chapters. In **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will establish the theoretical foundation, showing how the electromagnetic field carries its own momentum and angular momentum, and introducing the Maxwell stress tensor as the mathematical tool to describe this. Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will examine the tangible consequences of [field momentum](@entry_id:267786), from the [radiation pressure](@entry_id:143156) that drives [solar sails](@entry_id:273839) to the subtle forces that allow [optical tweezers](@entry_id:157699) to manipulate biological cells. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will provide an opportunity to solidify these concepts by working through problems that highlight the interplay between [field momentum](@entry_id:267786), mechanical motion, and the fundamental laws of [electrodynamics](@entry_id:158759).

## Principles and Mechanisms

In classical mechanics, the conservation of momentum is a cornerstone principle, arising fundamentally from the translational symmetry of space. For a closed system of interacting particles, the total momentum—the vector sum of the individual momenta of all particles—remains constant. This relies on Newton's third law, which guarantees that for every force exerted by particle A on particle B, there is an equal and opposite force exerted by B on A. However, when we extend our consideration to charged particles interacting via [electromagnetic fields](@entry_id:272866), this simple picture breaks down. The force on one charge depends on the state of the field, which was generated by another charge at an earlier, retarded time. Consequently, the forces between two interacting charges are not necessarily equal and opposite at any given instant.

This apparent violation of momentum conservation compels us to re-evaluate our definition of a "[closed system](@entry_id:139565)." The resolution lies in recognizing that the electromagnetic field is not merely a passive intermediary for forces but is a dynamic entity in its own right, possessing physical attributes, including energy and momentum. The complete system, whose momentum is conserved, must include both the mechanical momentum of charged particles and the momentum stored within the electromagnetic fields themselves.

### Field Momentum and the Maxwell Stress Tensor

To formalize the concept of [field momentum](@entry_id:267786), we begin with the Lorentz force law, which gives the force density (force per unit volume) on a distribution of charge and current:

$$
\mathbf{f} = \rho\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B}
$$

The total force on all charges within a volume $V$ is $\mathbf{F}_{mech} = \int_V \mathbf{f} \, d^3r$, which by Newton's second law equals the rate of change of the mechanical momentum of the charges, $\frac{d\mathbf{P}_{mech}}{dt}$. Our goal is to express this force entirely in terms of the fields $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, using Maxwell's equations to eliminate the sources $\rho$ and $\mathbf{J}$:

$$
\rho = \epsilon_0 \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}
$$
$$
\mathbf{J} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\nabla \times \mathbf{B} - \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
$$

Substituting these into the force density expression and employing several [vector calculus identities](@entry_id:161863), we can recast the expression for the total force into a profound conservation law:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{P}_{mech}}{dt} + \frac{d}{dt} \int_V \epsilon_0 (\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}) \, d^3r = \oint_S \mathbf{T} \cdot d\mathbf{a}
$$

This equation is the central result for momentum conservation in electrodynamics. Let us dissect its components. The first term is the rate of change of the total mechanical momentum of the charges and currents within the volume $V$. The second term involves a new quantity. We define the **[electromagnetic momentum](@entry_id:268129) density** as:

$$
\mathbf{g}_{EM} = \epsilon_0 (\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}) = \frac{1}{c^2} \mathbf{S}
$$

where $\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}(\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B})$ is the Poynting vector. This shows that wherever the Poynting vector is non-zero, indicating energy flow, there is also a corresponding momentum density stored in the fields. The integral $\mathbf{P}_{EM} = \int_V \mathbf{g}_{EM} \, d^3r$ represents the total momentum residing in the electromagnetic field within volume $V$.

The term on the right-hand side of the conservation law represents the flow of momentum across the surface $S$ that bounds the volume $V$. The object $\mathbf{T}$ is a tensor of rank two known as the **Maxwell stress tensor**, defined by its components:

$$
T_{ij} = \epsilon_0 \left( E_i E_j - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{ij} E^2 \right) + \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left( B_i B_j - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{ij} B^2 \right)
$$

The physical interpretation of $\mathbf{T}$ is that $-T_{ij}$ is the flux of the $i$-th component of momentum passing through a surface oriented in the $j$-direction. The diagonal elements, such as $T_{xx}$, represent pressures, while the off-diagonal elements, like $T_{xy}$, represent shear stresses exerted by the fields.

For an isolated system, where we can extend the volume $V$ to encompass all space, the surface integral over the [boundary at infinity](@entry_id:634468) vanishes (assuming the fields fall off sufficiently fast). In this crucial case, the conservation law simplifies to:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} (\mathbf{P}_{mech} + \mathbf{P}_{EM}) = 0
$$

This equation states that the **total momentum** of an [isolated system](@entry_id:142067)—the sum of the mechanical momentum of all particles and the total momentum stored in the electromagnetic field—is conserved. Momentum can be exchanged between particles and fields, but the total amount remains constant.

### Applications of Linear Momentum Conservation

The principle that fields carry momentum resolves numerous paradoxes and provides profound insights into the interaction of matter and radiation.

#### Momentum in Static Fields

It may seem counterintuitive that static fields could contain momentum, as we often associate momentum with motion. However, the [momentum density](@entry_id:271360) $\mathbf{g}_{EM} = \epsilon_0 (\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B})$ only requires the coexistence of non-parallel electric and magnetic fields. Consider a thought experiment where a parallel-plate capacitor is slowly charged while situated in a uniform external magnetic field parallel to its plates [@problem_id:1572973]. Initially, the system is at rest and the capacitor is uncharged, so $\mathbf{E}=0$. The mechanical momentum $\mathbf{P}_{mech,i}$ and the [field momentum](@entry_id:267786) $\mathbf{P}_{EM,i}$ are both zero. As the capacitor charges, a [uniform electric field](@entry_id:264305) $\mathbf{E}$ is established between the plates, perpendicular to the existing magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$. This creates a non-zero, uniform [momentum density](@entry_id:271360) $\mathbf{g}_{EM}$ within the volume of the capacitor. The total [field momentum](@entry_id:267786) in the final state, $\mathbf{P}_{EM,f}$, is the product of this density and the volume. To conserve the total momentum of the [isolated system](@entry_id:142067) (which must remain zero), the capacitor and its charging apparatus must acquire a mechanical momentum precisely opposite to the newly created [field momentum](@entry_id:267786): $\mathbf{P}_{mech,f} = -\mathbf{P}_{EM,f}$. This mechanical momentum is imparted by a net impulse delivered to the apparatus during the charging process.

A complementary scenario involves a pre-charged capacitor at rest in a magnetic field, which is then discharged through a resistive material placed between its plates [@problem_id:1572989]. Initially, the system possesses [field momentum](@entry_id:267786) $\mathbf{P}_{EM,i}$ but zero mechanical momentum. As the capacitor discharges, the electric field and thus the [field momentum](@entry_id:267786) decay to zero. This "lost" [field momentum](@entry_id:267786) is transferred to the capacitor assembly, causing it to accelerate and acquire a final mechanical momentum equal to the initial [field momentum](@entry_id:267786): $\mathbf{P}_{mech,f} = \mathbf{P}_{EM,i}$. This result can be independently verified by calculating the total impulse delivered by the Lorentz force ($\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}$) acting on the transient discharge current, providing a satisfying confirmation of the [field momentum](@entry_id:267786) concept.

#### Symmetry and Null Results

The vector nature of [momentum density](@entry_id:271360) is critical. Not every combination of $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ fields results in a net [field momentum](@entry_id:267786). Consider a point charge fixed at the center of a dielectric sphere, with the entire system immersed in a uniform external magnetic field [@problem_id:1572952]. The [point charge](@entry_id:274116) produces a spherically symmetric, [radial electric field](@entry_id:194700): $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = E(r)\hat{r}$. The [momentum density](@entry_id:271360) is $\mathbf{g}_{EM} = \epsilon_0 E(r) (\hat{r} \times \mathbf{B})$. When we integrate this density over all space to find the total [field momentum](@entry_id:267786) $\mathbf{P}_{EM}$, the integral vanishes due to the [spherical symmetry](@entry_id:272852). For any volume element $d^3r$ contributing a local momentum $\mathbf{g}_{EM} d^3r$, there is a corresponding [volume element](@entry_id:267802) on the opposite side of the origin whose contribution is exactly cancelled. Consequently, the total [field momentum](@entry_id:267786) is zero both before and after the external magnetic field is switched off. Since the change in [field momentum](@entry_id:267786) is zero, the principle of momentum conservation dictates that the total mechanical impulse delivered to the sphere must also be zero.

#### Momentum of a Moving Charge and Electromagnetic Mass

A charged object in motion carries its electric and magnetic fields with it. These co-moving fields store momentum. For a classical model of an electron as a uniformly charged spherical shell moving at a non-relativistic velocity $\mathbf{v}$, the fields it generates store a total momentum that is directly proportional to its velocity [@problem_id:1573000]. The calculation yields:

$$
\mathbf{P}_{field} = \left(\frac{4}{3} \frac{U}{c^2}\right) \mathbf{v}
$$

where $U$ is the [electrostatic self-energy](@entry_id:177518) of the charged shell. This is a remarkable result. Since the [field momentum](@entry_id:267786) has the form of (mass) $\times$ (velocity), it suggests that the fields contribute an "[electromagnetic mass](@entry_id:265821)" $m_{em} = \frac{4}{3} \frac{U}{c^2}$ to the particle's total inertia. This led to historical speculation, most notably by J.J. Thomson and others, that all mass might ultimately be of electromagnetic origin. While this view is not sustained by modern physics, the concept that a particle's self-field contributes to its inertial properties remains a profound consequence of [electrodynamics](@entry_id:158759).

#### Momentum of Radiation

Electromagnetic waves, such as light, consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that are mutually perpendicular and perpendicular to the direction of propagation. The cross product $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ is therefore always non-zero and points in the direction of wave travel. This means that electromagnetic radiation carries momentum. When a wave is absorbed or reflected by a surface, this momentum is transferred, resulting in a force known as **radiation pressure**. This phenomenon has tangible consequences, from the slight push of sunlight on a [solar sail](@entry_id:268363) to the technology of [laser cooling](@entry_id:138751), where precisely tuned laser light is used to slow down atoms to near absolute zero [@problem_id:1572992]. In this process, an atom absorbs a photon, and by conservation of momentum, the atom's velocity changes by an amount determined by the photon's momentum. In quantum mechanics, a photon of wavelength $\lambda$ has momentum $p = h/\lambda$, a result that connects seamlessly with the classical picture of momentum carried by an electromagnetic wave.

### Conservation of Angular Momentum

The conservation law can be extended to angular momentum. The field possesses an **angular [momentum density](@entry_id:271360)** relative to an origin, given by:

$$
\boldsymbol{\ell}_{EM} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{g}_{EM} = \mathbf{r} \times \left( \epsilon_0 (\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}) \right)
$$

Integrating this density over all space gives the [total angular momentum](@entry_id:155748) stored in the field, $\mathbf{L}_{EM}$. For an [isolated system](@entry_id:142067), the [total angular momentum](@entry_id:155748)—the sum of the mechanical angular momentum of matter and the angular momentum of the field—is conserved:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} (\mathbf{L}_{mech} + \mathbf{L}_{EM}) = 0
$$

#### "Hidden" Angular Momentum in Static Fields

Perhaps the most striking consequence of [field angular momentum](@entry_id:268053) is that it can exist even in perfectly [static systems](@entry_id:272358) where nothing is moving. A classic, albeit hypothetical, example is a system consisting of a point electric charge $q$ and a point magnetic monopole $g_m$ held at a fixed separation [@problem_id:1572953]. The electric field of the charge radiates outward, while the magnetic field of the monopole also radiates outward. The [cross product](@entry_id:156749) $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ results in a momentum density field that circulates around the axis connecting the two particles. The total [field angular momentum](@entry_id:268053) is found to be non-zero and directed along this axis. This implies that the static fields themselves contain "frozen" or "hidden" angular momentum.

This hidden angular momentum can be converted into mechanical angular momentum, a phenomenon often illustrated by variants of the "Feynman disk paradox." Consider a stationary, uniformly charged spherical shell with a small magnetic dipole placed at its center [@problem_id:1572954]. This static configuration stores angular momentum in the crossed $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ fields. If the magnetization of the dipole is slowly reduced to zero, the magnetic field disappears, and the field's angular momentum must vanish. To conserve total angular momentum, this "lost" [field angular momentum](@entry_id:268053) is transferred to the charged shell, causing it to rotate. The mechanism of transfer is Faraday's law: the changing magnetic field induces a circulating electric field, which exerts a torque on the [surface charge](@entry_id:160539) of the shell. The same principle applies to systems involving a [current loop](@entry_id:271292) near a [point charge](@entry_id:274116) [@problem_id:1572983] or a charged cylinder outside a [solenoid](@entry_id:261182) [@problem_id:1572959]. In all such cases, a change in the static field configuration reveals the initial presence of [field angular momentum](@entry_id:268053) by converting it into observable mechanical motion.

#### Self-Angular Momentum

Just as a moving charge has an associated electromagnetic linear momentum, a rotating charged object has an associated electromagnetic angular momentum, distinct from its mechanical angular momentum $I\boldsymbol{\omega}$. Consider a uniformly charged spherical shell spun up from rest [@problem_id:1572994]. The rotation creates a [surface current](@entry_id:261791), which in turn generates a magnetic field. This magnetic field, in the presence of the sphere's own [radial electric field](@entry_id:194700), gives rise to a non-zero electromagnetic angular momentum. The [total angular momentum](@entry_id:155748) required to spin the sphere to an angular velocity $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is the sum of the mechanical part and this new electromagnetic part. The ratio of the [field angular momentum](@entry_id:268053) to the mechanical angular momentum is a constant that depends only on the charge, mass, and radius of the sphere, not its final rotation speed. This underscores that the electromagnetic field is an integral part of the dynamic identity of a charged, rotating body.
