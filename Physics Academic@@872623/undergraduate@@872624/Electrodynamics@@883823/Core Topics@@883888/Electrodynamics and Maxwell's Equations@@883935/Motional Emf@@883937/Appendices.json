The velocity vector $\\vec{v}$ is perpendicular to the magnetic field vector $\\vec{B}$. This means $\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0$. This is not the derived condition.

The component of the velocity vector $\\vec{v}$ that is parallel to the arms of the U-shaped wire is zero. This means $v_y = 0$. The full condition is $v_y B_z - v_z B_y = 0$. Setting $v_y=0$ only guarantees a zero EMF if we also have $v_z=0$ or $B_y=0$. It is not the most general condition. So, D is incorrect.\n\nE. The component of the magnetic field vector $\\vec{B}$ that is perpendicular to the plane containing the U-shaped wire is zero. The wire lies in the xy-plane. This means $B_z=0$. Again, this only guarantees zero EMF if we also have $v_z B_y = 0$. This is not the most general condition. So, E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most general condition for the EMF to be zero is that the component of $\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}$ along the direction of the base is zero.\n\nIt is instructive to see that if one were to calculate the EMF along each segment (let's call the corners C1 at (-W/2, 0, 0) and C2 at (W/2, 0, 0)), the EMFs along the two arms, $\\mathcal{E}_{DC1}$ and $\\mathcal{E}_{C2A}$, cancel each other out:\n$\\mathcal{E}_{DC1} = \\int_{D}^{C1} (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot d\\vec{l} = (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot (-L\\hat{j})$\n$\\mathcal{E}_{C2A} = \\int_{C2}^{A} (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot d\\vec{l} = (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot (L\\hat{j})$\nThe total EMF is the sum of EMFs along the segments D->C1, C1->C2, and C2->A.\n$\\mathcal{E}_{total} = \\mathcal{E}_{DC1} + \\mathcal{E}_{C1C2} + \\mathcal{E}_{C2A} = (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot (-L\\hat{j}) + (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot (W\\hat{i}) + (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot (L\\hat{j}) = (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot (W\\hat{i})$.\nThis confirms that the geometry of the arms is irrelevant to the total potential difference between the endpoints, which only depends on their separation vector.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1809886"}, {"introduction": "While the flux rule is a powerful tool, the ultimate origin of motional EMF is the Lorentz force acting on charge carriers.

Therefore, the external force, $\\vec{F}_{ext}$, must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the magnetic drag force, $\\vec{F}_{m}$, acting on the rod. The work done is then the integral of this force over the distance traveled.\n\nFirst, let's establish the geometry of the system. The rod's position along the $x$-axis at any time $t$ is given by $x(t) = vt$. The two rails are described by the lines $y = x \\tan(\\alpha/2)$ and $y = -x \\tan(\\alpha/2)$.

This resistance is $R(t) = \\lambda_R L_{eff}(t) = 2 \\lambda_R v t \\tan(\\alpha/2)$.\nUsing Ohm's law for the circuit, the induced current is:\n$$ I(t) = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}(t)}{R(t)} = \\frac{2 B_0 v^2 t \\tan(\\alpha/2)}{2 \\lambda_R v t \\tan(\\alpha/2)} = \\frac{B_0 v}{\\lambda_R} $$\nInterestingly, the induced current $I$ is constant over time.\n\nThe magnetic force on a straight wire of length $L_{eff}$ carrying current $I$ in a uniform magnetic field $B_0$ is given by $\\vec{F}_m = I (\\vec{L}_{eff} \\times \\vec{B})$.
