This first practice demonstrates this fundamental principle by asking you to calculate the self-inductance for one of the most basic structures in electronics: a parallel-plate transmission line. By working through this idealized scenario, you will connect the flow of current to the magnetic field it produces and, ultimately, to the system's inductance, a crucial skill for designing high-frequency circuits [@problem_id:1586110].", "problem": "In the design of high-speed electronics, such as on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), understanding the properties of signal paths is crucial. Consider a simplified model of a microstrip transmission line, which consists of two long, flat, parallel conducting plates. Each plate has a width $w$ and they are separated by a small distance $d$. Assume the space between the plates is a vacuum with the permeability of free space, $\\mu_0$. A steady current $I$ flows uniformly down one plate and returns along the other in the opposite direction.\n\nFor this problem, you may make the following idealizations: the length of the plates is much greater than both their width and separation ($L \\gg w$ and $L \\gg d$), and the width is much greater than the separation ($w \\gg d$). The assumption $w \\gg d$ allows you to neglect fringing magnetic fields at the edges of the plates.\n\nDetermine the self-inductance per unit length, $\\mathcal{L}$, of this two-plate system.
