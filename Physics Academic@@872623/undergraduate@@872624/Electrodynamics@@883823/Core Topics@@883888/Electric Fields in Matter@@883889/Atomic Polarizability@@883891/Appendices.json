This exercise employs the classical Lorentz oscillator model to connect the macroscopic polarizability, $\\alpha$, to the microscopic properties of an atom, specifically the natural oscillation frequency of its electrons. By establishing this link, we can appreciate how an atom's internal structure determines its response to an external electric field [@problem_id:1567258].", "problem": "In an atomic physics experiment, neutral atoms are manipulated using a spatially non-uniform electrostatic field. The behavior of an atom in this field is governed by its atomic polarizability. We consider two different types of atoms, Atom 1 and Atom 2.\n\nTo a good approximation, each atom can be described by the Lorentz model. In this classical model, a single outer electron (with charge $-e$ and mass $m_e$) is considered to be attached to a stationary, massive nucleus by a hypothetical spring. The restoring force of this spring is what binds the electron to the atom. For Atom 1, the natural angular frequency of the electron's oscillation is $\\omega_1$. For Atom 2, the corresponding natural angular frequency is $\\omega_2$.\n\nThe static atomic polarizability, $\\alpha$, is defined by the relation $\\vec{p} = \\alpha \\vec{E}$, where $\\vec{p}$ is the electric dipole moment induced in the atom by the external static electric field $\\vec{E}$.\n\nAn atom of type 1 and an atom of type 2 are placed, in separate trials, at the exact same spatial point inside the non-uniform electrostatic field. Let $F_1$ be the magnitude of the force exerted on Atom 1 and $F_2$ be the magnitude of the force exerted on Atom 2 at this point.\n\nDetermine the ratio $F_1 / F_2$.
