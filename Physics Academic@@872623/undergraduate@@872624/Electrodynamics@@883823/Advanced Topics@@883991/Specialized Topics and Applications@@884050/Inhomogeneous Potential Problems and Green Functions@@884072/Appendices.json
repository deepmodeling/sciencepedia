The shell is maintained at a constant electric potential of zero (i.e., it is grounded). The region inside the shell ($r<R$) is empty space.\n\nIn electrostatics, the response of such a system to a point source is described by a Dirichlet Green's function, $G(\\vec{r}, \\vec{r}')$.

This creates the first image charge, $q_1$. The charge is opposite in sign, and the angle is reflected.\n      $q_1 = (-q, -\\phi_0)$.\n    - Reflect the original charge $q_0 = (+q, \\phi_0)$ across the plane at $\\phi=\\alpha=\\pi/3$. The new angle is $\\phi_0 + 2(\\alpha - \\phi_0) = 2\\alpha - \\phi_0$.

The new charge is $-(-q) = +q$. The new angle is $2\\alpha - (-\\phi_0) = 2\\alpha + \\phi_0$. This creates image $q_3$.\n      $q_3 = (+q, 2\\alpha + \\phi_0) = (+q, \\frac{2\\pi}{3} + \\phi_0)$.\n    - Reflect the image $q_2 = (-q, 2\\alpha - \\phi_0)$ across the plane at $\\phi=0$. The new charge is $-(-q) = +q$. The new angle is $-(2\\alpha - \\phi_0) = \\phi_0 - 2\\alpha$.

The new charge is $-(+q) = -q$. The new angle is $-(2\\alpha + \\phi_0) = -2\\alpha - \\phi_0$.

The angle of $q_5$ is $-\\frac{2\\pi}{3} - \\phi_0$. The angle of $q_6$ is $\\frac{4\\pi}{3} - \\phi_0$. The difference between these angles is $(\\frac{4\\pi}{3} - \\phi_0) - (-\\frac{2\\pi}{3} - \\phi_0) = \\frac{6\\pi}{3} = 2\\pi$. Since the angles differ by $2\\pi$, they represent the same physical location. Both images also have the same charge, $-q$. Therefore, $q_5$ and $q_6$ are not two distinct images but rather the same image charge arrived at through two different reflection sequences. The process terminates here because any further reflections would generate images at locations already occupied by other images.\n\nThe total number of unique image charges is 5.
