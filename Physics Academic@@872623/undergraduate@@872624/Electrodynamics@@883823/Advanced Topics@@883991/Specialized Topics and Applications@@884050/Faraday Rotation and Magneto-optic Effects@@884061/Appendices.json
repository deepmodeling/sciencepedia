Mastering this concept is key to understanding why the Faraday effect is uniquely suited for applications like optical isolators. [@problem_id:1580519]", "problem": "An experimental setup is designed to characterize a new magneto-optic material. The material is shaped into a slab of length $L$. It is known that when linearly polarized light propagates through this material parallel to an externally applied uniform magnetic field $\\vec{B}$, its plane of polarization rotates. This phenomenon is non-reciprocal, meaning the direction of rotation (e.g., clockwise) with respect to the magnetic field vector is the same regardless of the light's direction of propagation.\n\nIn the experiment, a laser beam, initially linearly polarized in the vertical direction, is directed to propagate along the axis of the material slab. The magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is also aligned with this axis. A separate measurement, conducted without a mirror, confirms that a single pass of the beam through the slab (from one end to the other) results in a clockwise rotation of the polarization plane by an angle $\\theta_0$, as viewed by an observer looking towards the light source.\n\nFor the main experiment, a perfect, flat mirror is placed at the far end of the slab, perpendicular to the beam's path.
