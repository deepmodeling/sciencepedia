The first parameter, $S_0$, represents the total intensity of the light. The remaining parameters describe the polarization state. To solve this problem, we must first determine the Stokes vectors for each of the two individual beams and then combine them to find the Stokes vector of the composite beam.\n\nStep 1: Determine the Stokes vector for the horizontally polarized beam.\nFor a perfectly polarized beam, the intensity is $I$. For horizontally polarized light, the electric field oscillates entirely along the horizontal axis. The Stokes vector for such a beam is given by $S_h = (I_h, I_h, 0, 0)$.\nGiven the intensity $I_h = 2.0 \\text{ W/m}^2$, the Stokes vector for the first beam is:\n$S_h = (2.0, 2.0, 0, 0)$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the Stokes vector for the right-circularly polarized beam.\nFor right-circularly polarized light, the electric field vector rotates clockwise when viewed by an observer looking towards the source. The Stokes vector for such a beam with intensity $I_c$ is given by $S_c = (I_c, 0, 0, I_c)$.\nGiven the intensity $I_c = 5.0 \\text{ W/m}^2$, the Stokes vector for the second beam is:\n$S_c = (5.0, 0, 0, 5.0)$.\n\nStep 3: Combine the Stokes vectors for the composite beam.\nThe problem states that the two beams are incoherently superimposed. For incoherent superposition, the Stokes parameters of the constituent beams add linearly. Therefore, the Stokes vector of the final composite beam, $S_{comp}$, is the sum of the individual Stokes vectors:\n$S_{comp} = S_h + S_c = (2.0, 2.0, 0, 0) + (5.0, 0, 0, 5.0)$\n$S_{comp} = (2.0 + 5.0, 2.0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 5.0)$\n$S_{comp} = (7.0, 2.0, 0, 5.0)$.\nSo, for the composite beam, we have $S_0 = 7.0$, $S_1 = 2.0$, $S_2 = 0$, and $S_3 = 5.0$.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the degree of polarization, $P$.\nThe degree of polarization, $P$, is defined as the ratio of the intensity of the polarized component of the beam, $I_{pol}$, to the total intensity, $I_{tot}$. The total intensity is given by the first Stokes parameter, $I_{tot} = S_0$. The intensity of the polarized component is given by the magnitude of the polarization vector $(S_1, S_2, S_3)$, which is $I_{pol} = \\sqrt{S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2}$.\nThe formula for the degree of polarization is:\n$$P = \\frac{\\sqrt{S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2}}{S_0}$$\nSubstituting the values from the composite Stokes vector:\n$$P = \\frac{\\sqrt{(2.0)^2 + (0)^2 + (5.0)^2}}{7.0}$$\n$$P = \\frac{\\sqrt{4.0 + 0 + 25.0}}{7.0}$$\n$$P = \\frac{\\sqrt{29.0}}{7.0}$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$P \\approx \\frac{5.3851648}{7.0} \\approx 0.7693092...$$\n\nStep 5: Round the final answer.\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to three significant figures.\nThe fourth significant figure is 3, which is less than 5, so we round down.\n$$P \\approx 0.769$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.769}$$", "id": "1606692"}, {"introduction": "Analyzing how a polarization state evolves as it passes through a sequence of optical components is a central task in optics.
