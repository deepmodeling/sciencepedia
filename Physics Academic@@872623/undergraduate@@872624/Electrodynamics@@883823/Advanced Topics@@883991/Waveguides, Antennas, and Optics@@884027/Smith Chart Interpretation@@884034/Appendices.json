[@problem_id:1605209]", "problem": "In the analysis of high-frequency circuits, the Smith chart is an indispensable graphical tool for visualizing the complex reflection coefficient, $\\Gamma$, at the load of a transmission line. The reflection coefficient is related to the normalized load impedance, $z_L$, by the equation $\\Gamma = (z_L - 1) / (z_L + 1)$. Here, $z_L = Z_L / Z_0$, where $Z_L$ is the complex load impedance and $Z_0$ is the real-valued characteristic impedance of the transmission line.\n\nThe reflection coefficient is itself a complex number, which can be expressed in polar form as $\\Gamma = |\\Gamma|e^{j\\phi}$, where $|\\Gamma|$ is the magnitude and $\\phi$ is the phase angle.

The load is perfectly matched to the line ($Z_L = Z_0$).", "solution": "The problem asks for the physical characteristic of all load impedances $Z_L$ that correspond to a reflection coefficient $\\Gamma$ with a phase angle of $180^\\circ$.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the given condition on the reflection coefficient $\\Gamma$.\nThe reflection coefficient is a complex number given in polar form as $\\Gamma = |\\Gamma|e^{j\\phi}$. The problem states that the phase angle is $\\phi = 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi$ radians. Using Euler's formula, $e^{j\\pi} = \\cos(\\pi) + j\\sin(\\pi) = -1 + j(0) = -1$.\nTherefore, the reflection coefficient for any point on this locus can be written as:\n$$ \\Gamma = |\\Gamma|e^{j\\pi} = |\\Gamma|(-1) = -|\\Gamma| $$\nSince the magnitude $|\\Gamma|$ must be a non-negative real number, this means that $\\Gamma$ must be a real, non-positive number. On a Smith chart, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient ranges from $0$ (at the center) to $1$ (on the outer circle), so $0 \\le |\\Gamma| \\le 1$. This implies that for the specified locus, $\\Gamma$ takes on real values in the range $-1 \\le \\Gamma \\le 0$. This corresponds to the segment of the horizontal real axis of the complex $\\Gamma$-plane from the point $\\Gamma = -1$ (the left edge of the chart) to the point $\\Gamma = 0$ (the center of the chart). The case $\\Gamma=0$ corresponds to $Z_L=Z_0$ where the phase is undefined, so we consider the locus for $\\Gamma \\in [-1, 0)$.\n\nStep 2: Relate the reflection coefficient $\\Gamma$ to the normalized load impedance $z_L$.\nThe standard relationship is given by:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{z_L - 1}{z_L + 1} $$\nwhere $z_L = Z_L / Z_0$ is the normalized load impedance. We need to find the properties of $z_L$ when $\\Gamma = -|\\Gamma|$.\n\nStep 3: Solve for $z_L$ in terms of $\\Gamma$.\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for $z_L$:\n$$ \\Gamma (z_L + 1) = z_L - 1 $$\n$$ \\Gamma z_L + \\Gamma = z_L - 1 $$\n$$ \\Gamma + 1 = z_L - \\Gamma z_L $$\n$$ 1 + \\Gamma = z_L(1 - \\Gamma) $$\n$$ z_L = \\frac{1 + \\Gamma}{1 - \\Gamma} $$\n\nStep 4: Substitute the condition $\\Gamma = -|\\Gamma|$ into the expression for $z_L$.\n$$ z_L = \\frac{1 + (-|\\Gamma|)}{1 - (-|\\Gamma|)} = \\frac{1 - |\\Gamma|}{1 + |\\Gamma|} $$\n\nStep 5: Analyze the resulting expression for $z_L$.\nThe normalized impedance $z_L$ is a ratio of two real numbers, $(1 - |\\Gamma|)$ and $(1 + |\\Gamma|)$. Therefore, $z_L$ must be a real number. A real normalized impedance means that the load impedance $Z_L = z_L Z_0$ is also real, since $Z_0$ is real. A real impedance has no imaginary part, which means the load is purely resistive. This eliminates options C (purely inductive) and D (purely capacitive).\n\nNow, we need to determine the range of values for $z_L$. The magnitude $|\\Gamma|$ varies over the range $0 \\le |\\Gamma| \\le 1$.\n- Case 1: The center of the Smith chart. Here, $|\\Gamma| = 0$.\n  $$ z_L = \\frac{1 - 0}{1 + 0} = 1 $$\n  This corresponds to a normalized impedance of 1, meaning $Z_L / Z_0 = 1$, or $Z_L = Z_0$. This is the perfectly matched load, as described in option F. However, the phase of $\\Gamma=0$ is strictly undefined, so this point is the limit of the locus but not technically on it.\n\n- Case 2: The left edge of the Smith chart. Here, $|\\Gamma| = 1$.\n  $$ z_L = \\frac{1 - 1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{0}{2} = 0 $$\n  This corresponds to a normalized impedance of 0, meaning $Z_L / Z_0 = 0$, or $Z_L = 0$. This is a perfect short circuit.\n\n- Case 3: Points between the center and the left edge. Here, $0  |\\Gamma|  1$.\n  In this range, both the numerator $(1 - |\\Gamma|)$ and the denominator $(1 + |\\Gamma|)$ are positive.\n  Furthermore, since $|\\Gamma|  0$, we have $(1 - |\\Gamma|)  (1 + |\\Gamma|)$.\n  Therefore, the ratio must be less than 1:\n  $$ z_L = \\frac{1 - |\\Gamma|}{1 + |\\Gamma|}  1 $$\n  Also, since $|\\Gamma|  1$, the numerator is positive, so $z_L  0$.\n  Combining these results, for $0  |\\Gamma|  1$, we have $0  z_L  1$.\n\nStep 6: Synthesize the results and select the correct option.\nThe locus of points where the phase of $\\Gamma$ is $180^\\circ$ corresponds to values of $|\\Gamma|$ in the range $(0, 1]$. This corresponds to normalized impedances $z_L$ in the range $[0, 1)$.\nIn terms of the physical load impedance $Z_L = z_L Z_0$, this means $0 \\le Z_L  Z_0$.\nThis describes all purely resistive loads with an impedance value less than the characteristic impedance, including a short circuit ($Z_L = 0$) but excluding a perfect match ($Z_L = Z_0$).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. The load is a perfect open circuit ($Z_L \\to \\infty$). Incorrect. This corresponds to $\\Gamma = +1$ on the far right of the chart, where $\\phi=0^\\circ$.\nB. The load is purely resistive with $Z_L  Z_0$. Incorrect. This corresponds to $z_L  1$, which gives a positive real $\\Gamma$ and $\\phi=0^\\circ$.\nC. The load is purely inductive. Incorrect. This is the upper half of the Smith chart.\nD. The load is purely capacitive. Incorrect. This is the lower half of the Smith chart.\nE. The load is purely resistive with an impedance $Z_L$ such that $0 \\le Z_L  Z_0$. This perfectly matches our derived condition.\nF. The load is perfectly matched ($Z_L = Z_0$). Incorrect. This is only the limit point at the center of the chart ($\\Gamma=0$), which is not part of the locus itself as the phase is undefined.\n\nThus, the correct description for all impedances on this locus is given by option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1605209"}, {"introduction": "Beyond static analysis, the Smith chart's true power lies in its ability to act as a graphical calculator for transmission line problems.

Yes, a perfect match is achievable because the load impedance has a capacitive component, and adding another capacitor in shunt can be tuned to achieve the match.\n\nE. No, a perfect match is not achievable because matching this load requires a series element, not a shunt element.", "solution": "The goal is to determine if a single shunt capacitor can be used to perfectly match the load impedance $Z_L = 25 - j25\\,\\Omega$ to a system with characteristic impedance $Z_0=50\\,\\Omega$. A perfect match corresponds to a reflection coefficient of zero, which occurs when the total load impedance seen by the transmission line is equal to $Z_0$.\n\nStep 1: Normalize the load impedance.\nThe normalized load impedance, denoted by $z_L$, is found by dividing the load impedance $Z_L$ by the characteristic impedance $Z_0$.\n$$z_L = \\frac{Z_L}{Z_0} = \\frac{25 - j25\\,\\Omega}{50\\,\\Omega} = 0.5 - j0.5$$\n\nStep 2: Convert the normalized impedance to normalized admittance.\nSince the proposed matching element (a capacitor) is in shunt (parallel), it is most convenient to work with admittances, as admittances in parallel add together. The normalized load admittance $y_L$ is the reciprocal of the normalized load impedance $z_L$.\n$$y_L = \\frac{1}{z_L} = \\frac{1}{0.5 - j0.5}$$\nTo simplify this complex number, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n$$y_L = \\frac{1}{0.5 - j0.5} \\times \\frac{0.5 + j0.5}{0.5 + j0.5} = \\frac{0.5 + j0.5}{(0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2} = \\frac{0.5 + j0.5}{0.25 + 0.25} = \\frac{0.5 + j0.5}{0.5}$$\n$$y_L = 1 + j1$$\nThe normalized admittance is composed of a normalized conductance $g_L = 1$ and a normalized susceptance $b_L = +1$. The positive sign of the susceptance indicates that the load admittance is inductive. This is a crucial point; while the load *impedance* $Z_L$ is capacitive (negative imaginary part), the load *admittance* $Y_L$ is inductive (positive imaginary part).\n\nStep 3: Analyze the matching process on an admittance Smith chart.\nOn a normalized admittance Smith chart, the center of the chart represents the matched condition, where the normalized admittance is $y = 1 + j0$. Our starting point is the normalized load admittance, $y_L = 1 + j1$.\nAdding a component in shunt corresponds to adding its admittance to the load admittance. On the Smith chart, this means moving along a circle of constant conductance, $g$. In our case, the load admittance is on the $g=1$ circle.\n\nStep 4: Determine the effect of adding a shunt capacitor.\nAn ideal capacitor has a purely imaginary admittance given by $Y_{cap} = j\\omega C$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency and $C$ is the capacitance. Its normalized admittance is $y_{cap} = Y_{cap}/Y_0 = j\\omega C / Y_0 = jb_{cap}$, where $Y_0 = 1/Z_0$ and $b_{cap}  0$.\nWhen we add the shunt capacitor, the total normalized admittance $y_{total}$ becomes:\n$$y_{total} = y_L + y_{cap} = (1 + j1) + jb_{cap} = 1 + j(1 + b_{cap})$$\nSince $b_{cap}$ is always positive for a capacitor, the total susceptance will be greater than 1. On the admittance Smith chart, adding a shunt capacitor corresponds to moving from the point $1+j1$ along the $g=1$ constant conductance circle in the direction of increasing positive susceptance. This is a clockwise movement along the circle.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the feasibility of the match.\nThe target for a perfect match is the center of the chart, $y = 1 + j0$. To get from our starting point $y_L = 1 + j1$ to the matched point $y=1+j0$, we need to add a normalized susceptance of $-j1$. This would require a component with a negative susceptance, which is an inductor ($y_{ind} = -j/(\\omega L Y_0)$).\nAdding a shunt capacitor, which adds positive susceptance, moves the operating point from $1+j1$ to $1+j(1+b_{cap})$. This moves us *away* from the target matched point $1+j0$ along the $g=1$ circle. Therefore, a perfect match cannot be achieved using only a single shunt capacitor.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options.\n- A is incorrect. While the real part of the admittance is 1, a capacitor adds positive susceptance and cannot \"cancel\" the existing positive susceptance of $+j1$.\n- B is correct. As derived, the starting point is $y_L = 1+j1$. Adding a shunt capacitor adds more positive susceptance, moving the point clockwise along the $g=1$ circle, which is away from the center point $1+j0$.\n- C is incorrect. A single shunt element can match any load whose normalized admittance lies on the $g=1$ circle (provided the correct element, inductor or capacitor, is chosen).\n- D is incorrect. It mistakenly assumes that because the load impedance is capacitive, a shunt capacitor is the right choice. It fails to recognize that the admittance of the capacitive load is actually inductive.\n- E is incorrect. A single series element would only work if the normalized *impedance* was on the $r=1$ circle. Here, $z_L = 0.5 - j0.5$, which is not on the $r=1$ circle. So a single series element also would not work.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the proposal is not valid, and the reasoning is that the required path on the admittance Smith chart cannot be traversed by adding a shunt capacitor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1605201"}]}
