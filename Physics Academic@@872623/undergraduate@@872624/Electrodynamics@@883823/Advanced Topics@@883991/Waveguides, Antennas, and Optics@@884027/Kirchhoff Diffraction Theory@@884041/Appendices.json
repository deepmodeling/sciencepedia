We use the Fraunhofer diffraction approximation. The electric field $E(\\theta)$ in the far-field at an observation angle $\\theta$ is proportional to the Fourier transform of the aperture function.\n\nThe aperture is a slit of width $a$. A point within the slit can be described by its $y$-coordinate, $y'$, where $-a/2 \\le y' \\le a/2$. A plane wave incident at an angle $\\alpha$ imparts a phase variation across the slit. The field at a point $y'$ in the slit is given by $U(y') = U_0 \\exp(i k y' \\sin\\alpha)$, where $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$ is the wavenumber and $U_0$ is the constant amplitude of the incident wave at the slit.\n\nThe far-field electric field amplitude $E(\\theta)$ is given by the diffraction integral:\n$$\nE(\\theta) \\propto \\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} U(y') \\exp(-i k y' \\sin\\theta) dy'\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $U(y')$, we get:\n$$\nE(\\theta) \\propto \\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} U_0 \\exp(i k y' \\sin\\alpha) \\exp(-i k y' \\sin\\theta) dy'\n$$\n$$\nE(\\theta) \\propto U_0 \\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} \\exp(i k (\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta) y') dy'\n$$\nLet's evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} \\exp(i k (\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta) y') dy' = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(i k (\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta) y')}{i k (\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta)} \\right]_{-a/2}^{a/2}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{\\exp\\left(i \\frac{ka}{2} (\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta)\\right) - \\exp\\left(-i \\frac{ka}{2} (\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta)\\right)}{i k (\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta)}\n$$\nUsing the Euler identity $\\sin(x) = (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})/(2i)$, the numerator becomes $2i \\sin\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}(\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta)\\right)$.\n$$\n= \\frac{2i \\sin\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}(\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta)\\right)}{i k (\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta)} = \\frac{2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}(\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta)\\right)}{k (\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta)}\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $a/2$:\n$$\n= a \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}(\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta)\\right)}{\\frac{ka}{2}(\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta)}\n$$\nLet's define the variable $\\phi = \\frac{ka}{2}(\\sin\\alpha - \\sin\\theta)$.
