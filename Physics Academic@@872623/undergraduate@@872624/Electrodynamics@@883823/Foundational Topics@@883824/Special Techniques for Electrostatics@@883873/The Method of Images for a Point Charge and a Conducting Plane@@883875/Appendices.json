This exercise challenges you to calculate the net force on a charge in the presence of both another real charge and a conducting plane.

The presence of the infinite grounded conducting plane can be handled using the method of images. This method states that the electric field in the region $z>0$ is the same as the field produced by the original charges and a set of \"image\" charges in the region $z<0$. For a point charge $+q$ at a distance $z_0$ from a grounded plane at $z=0$, the image charge is $-q$ located at a distance $-z_0$ from the plane.\n\nThe physical system consists of the conducting plane at $z=0$ and two charges in the region $z>0$:\n- Charge $q_A$ at position $\\vec{r}_A = (0, 0, d)$.\n- Charge $q_B$ at position $\\vec{r}_B = (0, 0, 3d)$.\n\nThe equivalent problem, valid for the region $z>0$, consists of four charges and no plane:\n1.
