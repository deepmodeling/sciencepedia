This first practice explores the profound effect of a conducting shell on the field of an internal charge, a core concept known as electrostatic shielding. By analyzing this system, you will see how induced charges on the conductor rearrange themselves to completely alter the field's configuration, leading to a surprisingly simple result for an observer outside the shell [@problem_id:1793606].", "problem": "A hollow, neutral, conducting spherical shell has an inner radius $R_1$ and an outer radius $R_2$.

Let $E_A$ denote the magnitude of the total electric field at point P due to the complete system (the point charge and the conducting shell). Let $E_B$ denote the magnitude of the electric field that would exist at point P if the conducting shell were completely removed, leaving only the point charge $+q$ at its position on the z-axis.\n\nDetermine the dimensionless ratio $\\frac{E_A}{E_B}$.

Electrostatic equilibrium requires the electric field inside the conducting material to vanish, so the conductor is an equipotential. Induced charges appear: $-q$ on the inner surface and $+q$ on the outer surface, so the conductor’s net charge remains zero, and the total charge of the entire system is $q$.\n\nConsider the exterior region $r>R_{2}$. The potential there satisfies Laplace’s equation, $\\nabla^{2}V=0$, with boundary condition that the potential on the spherical surface $r=R_{2}$ is constant (since the conductor is an equipotential), say $V(R_{2},\\theta,\\phi)=V_{0}$, and with $V\\to 0$ as $r\\to\\infty$ (choice of reference).
