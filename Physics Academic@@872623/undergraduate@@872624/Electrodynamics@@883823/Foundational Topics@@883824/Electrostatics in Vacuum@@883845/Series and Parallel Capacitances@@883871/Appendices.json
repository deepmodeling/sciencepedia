The equivalent capacitance is then given by the definition $C_{eq} = \\frac{Q_{total}}{V}$.\n\nLet's set up the potentials of the pads. We connect the positive terminal of a voltage source to pad P and the negative terminal to pad Q. We can define the potential of pad Q as the reference potential, so $V_Q = 0$. Consequently, the potential of pad P is $V_P = V$. Pad R is not connected to the external source; it is an electrically isolated node within the circuit. Its potential, which we will call $V_R$, is unknown and must be determined by the circuit configuration.\n\nSince pad R is isolated, the net charge on it must be zero, assuming it was initially uncharged. The total charge on pad R is the sum of the charges on the two capacitor plates connected to it. One plate is from capacitor $C_2$ (connected to Q) and the other is from capacitor $C_3$ (connected to P).\nThe charge on the plate of $C_2$ connected to R is given by $Q_{R,C2} = C_2(V_R - V_Q) = C_2(V_R - 0) = C_2V_R$.\nThe charge on the plate of $C_3$ connected to R is given by $Q_{R,C3} = C_3(V_R - V_P) = C_3(V_R - V)$.\nThe condition for charge conservation on the isolated pad R is $Q_{R,C2} + Q_{R,C3} = 0$.\nSubstituting the expressions for the charges, we get:\n$C_2V_R + C_3(V_R - V) = 0$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for the unknown potential $V_R$:\n$C_2V_R + C_3V_R - C_3V = 0$\n$V_R(C_2 + C_3) = C_3V$\n$$V_R = V \\frac{C_3}{C_2 + C_3}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total charge $Q_{total}$ that flows from the positive terminal of the source to pad P.
