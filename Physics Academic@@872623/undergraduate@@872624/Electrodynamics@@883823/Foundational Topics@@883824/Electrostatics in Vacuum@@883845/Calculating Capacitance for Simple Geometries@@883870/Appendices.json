Given the conical symmetry of the problem, it is natural to work in spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$. Due to the symmetry, the potential $V$ cannot depend on the azimuthal angle $\\phi$. Furthermore, since a scaling of all distances ($r \\to \\alpha r$) should not change the potential difference between the cones (which are defined by angles), we can look for a solution where the potential depends only on the polar angle $\\theta$, so $V = V(\\theta)$.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, Laplace's equation is:\n$$ \\nabla^2 V = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r^2 \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2\\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}\\left(\\sin\\theta \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial\\theta}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial\\phi^2} = 0 $$\nWith $V=V(\\theta)$, this equation simplifies significantly to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^2\\sin\\theta}\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left(\\sin\\theta \\frac{dV}{d\\theta}\\right) = 0 $$\nSince this must hold for all $r>0$, we must have:\n$$ \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left(\\sin\\theta \\frac{dV}{d\\theta}\\right) = 0 $$\nIntegrating this equation once with respect to $\\theta$ gives:\n$$ \\sin\\theta \\frac{dV}{d\\theta} = A $$\nwhere $A$ is a constant of integration.
