The spheres are small enough that they can be considered point-like when calculating interactions at a distance. Initially, sphere A has a charge of $+2Q$, sphere B has a charge of $+7Q$, and sphere C has a charge of $-3Q$. The spheres are mounted on insulating stands and are subjected to the following sequence of operations. Throughout the process, the spheres are kept far apart from one another, except for the moments of direct contact.\n\n1.  First, sphere A is brought into contact with sphere B. After they reach electrostatic equilibrium, they are separated.\n2.  Next, sphere B is brought into contact with sphere C. After they reach equilibrium, they are separated.\n3.  Finally, sphere C is brought into contact with sphere A. After they reach equilibrium, they are separated.\n\nDetermine the final electric charge on sphere A after this entire sequence is completed. Express your answer as a multiple of $Q$.", "solution": "Because the spheres are identical conductors, bringing any two into contact leads to charge redistribution until they reach the same potential. For identical spheres, this implies equal final charges, and by conservation of charge, the final charge on each of the two spheres after contact is the arithmetic mean of their initial charges. Symbolically, if charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are brought into contact on identical spheres, the final charges are $q_{1}^{\\prime} = q_{2}^{\\prime} = \\frac{q_{1} + q_{2}}{2}$.\n\nInitially, the charges are $q_{A} = 2Q$, $q_{B} = 7Q$, and $q_{C} = -3Q$.\n\nStep 1 (A contacts B): The total charge is conserved:\n$$\nq_{A}^{\\prime} = q_{B}^{\\prime} = \\frac{q_{A} + q_{B}}{2} = \\frac{2Q + 7Q}{2} = \\frac{9Q}{2}.\n$$\nAfter separation: $q_{A} = \\frac{9Q}{2}$, $q_{B} = \\frac{9Q}{2}$, $q_{C} = -3Q$.\n\nStep 2 (B contacts C): The total charge of B and C is conserved:\n$$\nq_{B}^{\\prime} = q_{C}^{\\prime} = \\frac{q_{B} + q_{C}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{9Q}{2} - 3Q}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{3Q}{2}}{2} = \\frac{3Q}{4}.\n$$\nAfter separation: $q_{A} = \\frac{9Q}{2}$, $q_{B} = \\frac{3Q}{4}$, $q_{C} = \\frac{3Q}{4}$.\n\nStep 3 (C contacts A): The total charge of C and A is conserved:\n$$\nq_{A}^{\\prime} = q_{C}^{\\prime} = \\frac{q_{A} + q_{C}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{9Q}{2} + \\frac{3Q}{4}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{18Q}{4} + \\frac{3Q}{4}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{21Q}{4}}{2} = \\frac{21Q}{8}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the final charge on sphere A is $\\frac{21}{8}Q$.

This exercise delves into the mechanism of electrostatic shielding by examining a conductor with an internal cavity containing a point charge [@problem_id:1572354]. This scenario allows you to see how a conductor actively responds by inducing a charge on its inner surface to cancel the field within its bulk, effectively isolating the exterior from the interior.", "problem": "Consider a solid, spherical conductor of radius $R$. This conductor is initially electrically neutral. A small, non-concentric cavity is carved out from within the conductor. A point charge with charge $+q$ (where $q > 0$) is placed and fixed at an arbitrary position inside this cavity. After this, an additional net charge of $+Q$ is carefully deposited onto the conductor. We are interested in the electric field in the region outside the conductor. Assuming the system has reached electrostatic equilibrium, determine the magnitude of the electric field, $E$, at a point P located at a distance $r$ from the center of the spherical conductor, where $r > R$. Express your final answer as an analytic expression in terms of $q$, $Q$, $r$, and the permittivity of free space, $\\epsilon_0$.", "solution": "We use the defining properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium: the electric field inside the conducting material is zero, the conductor is an equipotential, and all free charge resides on its surfaces.\n\nFirst, place the point charge $+q$ inside the non-concentric cavity. Consider a Gaussian surface taken entirely within the conductor, tightly wrapping the inner cavity surface. Since the electric field inside the conducting material is zero, Gauss's law,\n$$\n\\oint \\mathbf{E}\\cdot d\\mathbf{A}=\\frac{Q_{\\text{enc}}}{\\epsilon_{0}},\n$$\ngives zero flux, hence the enclosed charge must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge $+q$ in the cavity and the induced charge $Q_{\\text{inner}}$ on the inner cavity surface. Therefore,\n$$\nq+Q_{\\text{inner}}=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad Q_{\\text{inner}}=-q.\n$$\nBecause the conductor was initially neutral, the outer surface must then carry $Q_{\\text{outer}}=+q$ so that the total conductor charge remains zero.\n\nNext, an additional charge $+Q$ is deposited onto the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium, any added free charge resides on the outer surface. The induced charge on the inner surface remains $-q$ (it is fixed by the requirement that the field in the conductor vanish). Therefore, after deposition,\n$$\nQ_{\\text{inner}}=-q, \\qquad Q_{\\text{outer}}=q+Q.\n$$\n\nNow consider the region outside the spherical conductor, $r>R$. The conductor's outer surface is a sphere and an equipotential, so the potential on $r=R$ is a constant (independent of angle). The electrostatic potential in the exterior vacuum satisfies Laplace's equation and is uniquely determined by its boundary value on $r=R$ together with $V\\to 0$ as $r\\to\\infty$. A constant boundary value on a sphere implies a spherically symmetric exterior solution. Hence, the field outside is radial and depends only on the total charge residing on the outer surface. Equivalently, by charge bookkeeping or by Gauss's law on a concentric spherical Gaussian surface of radius $r>R$, the total enclosed charge is\n$$\nQ_{\\text{enc}}=q+Q,\n$$\nsince the contributions $+q$ (point charge) and $-q$ (inner surface) cancel, leaving $q+Q$ on the outer surface.\n\nSpherical symmetry then implies the electric field magnitude is uniform on the Gaussian sphere, so Gauss's law gives\n$$\nE(r)\\,4\\pi r^{2}=\\frac{q+Q}{\\epsilon_{0}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E(r)=\\frac{q+Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\,r^{2}},\n$$\ndirected radially outward.
