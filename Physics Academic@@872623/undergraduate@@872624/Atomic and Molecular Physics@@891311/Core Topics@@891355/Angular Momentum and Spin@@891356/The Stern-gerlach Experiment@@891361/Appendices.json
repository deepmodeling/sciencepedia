A well-collimated beam of neutral Rubidium-87 ($^{87}\\text{Rb}$) atoms is produced by an oven. These atoms travel along the x-axis with a uniform velocity $v$. The beam enters a region of length $L$ containing an inhomogeneous magnetic field.

The magnetic field and its gradient are negligible outside this region of length $L$. After exiting the magnetic field, the atoms travel an additional distance $D$ through a field-free vacuum chamber before impacting a detector screen.\n\nThe primary goal is to separate the atomic beam into two distinct spots on the screen, corresponding to the two possible spin orientations of the single valence electron in a Rubidium atom. The desired total vertical separation distance between the centers of these two spots is $d$. For your calculations, assume the magnetic moment of a Rubidium atom is due solely to the spin of its valence electron, and that the electron's spin g-factor is exactly $g_s = 2$.
