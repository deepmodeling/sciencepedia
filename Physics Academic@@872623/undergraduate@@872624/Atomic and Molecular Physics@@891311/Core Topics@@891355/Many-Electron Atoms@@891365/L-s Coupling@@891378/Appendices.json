This model combines the individual orbital angular momenta and spin angular momenta of electrons to find the total angular momentum of the atom.

For a given subshell with orbital quantum number $l$, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$ is obtained by coupling the single-electron orbital momenta, which can be tracked using the magnetic quantum numbers $m_{l} \\in \\{-l,-l+1,\\dots,l\\}$. Hund’s rules state:\n1) Maximize the total spin $S$.\n2) For a given $S$, maximize $L$ if the subshell is less than half-filled, and use the hole equivalence (or equivalently minimize $L$) if it is more than half-filled. For more-than-half-filled subshells, one may use the equivalence to the corresponding number of holes to infer the same $S$ and $L$ as the hole configuration.\n3) The value of $J$ is chosen last and is not needed here.\n\nA key special case is a half-filled subshell with $n=2l+1$ electrons. Then each $m_{l}$ is singly occupied with parallel spins. The sum of magnetic quantum numbers is\n$$\nM_{L}=\\sum_{m=-l}^{l} m=0,\n$$\nso the only possible resultant is $L=0$, giving an $S$ term ($L=0$). We apply this and Hund’s second rule to each configuration.\n\n- For $p^{3}$: Here $l=1$ and $2(2l+1)=6$, so $p^{3}$ is exactly half-filled. With one electron in each $m_{l}=-1,0,1$ and parallel spins, \n$$\nM_{L}=(-1)+0+1=0 \\implies L=0,\n$$\ngiving the ground term $^{4}S$. Thus $L=0$ for $p^{3}$ (option F).\n\n- For $d^{5}$: Here $l=2$ and $2(2l+1)=10$, so $d^{5}$ is half-filled. With one electron in each $m_{l}=-2,-1,0,1,2$ and parallel spins,\n$$\nM_{L}=(-2)+(-1)+0+1+2=0 \\implies L=0,\n$$\ngiving the ground term $^{6}S$. Thus $L=0$ for $d^{5}$ (option B).\n\n- For $f^{7}$: Here $l=3$ and $2(2l+1)=14$, so $f^{7}$ is half-filled. With one electron in each $m_{l}=-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3$ and parallel spins,\n$$\nM_{L}=\\sum_{m=-3}^{3} m=0 \\implies L=0,\n$$\ngiving the ground term $^{8}S$. Thus $L=0$ for $f^{7}$ (option D).\n\n- For $p^{2}$: This is less than half-filled. Maximize $S$ by taking parallel spins for the two electrons ($S=1$). Hund’s second rule then requires maximizing $L$. The largest $M_{L}$ consistent with the Pauli principle is obtained by choosing distinct $m_{l}$ values with the same spin, e.g., $m_{l}=1$ and $m_{l}=0$, giving $M_{L}=1$ and hence $L=1$ (term $^{3}P$). Therefore $L\\neq 0$ for $p^{2}$ (option C is incorrect).\n\n- For $p^{4}$: This is more than half-filled and is hole-equivalent to $p^{2}$. Hole equivalence gives the same $S$ and $L$ as $p^{2}$, hence $L=1$ (term $^{3}P$). Therefore $L\\neq 0$ for $p^{4}$ (option A is incorrect).\n\n- For $d^{8}$: This is more than half-filled and is hole-equivalent to $d^{2}$. For $d^{2}$ (less than half-filled), maximize $S=1$ and then maximize $L$ by taking the largest allowed $M_{L}$, e.g., $m_{l}=2$ and $m_{l}=1$, which gives $M_{L}=3$ and thus $L=3$ (term $^{3}F$). Therefore $d^{8}$ also has $L=3$, so $L\\neq 0$ (option E is incorrect).\n\nCollecting the results, the configurations guaranteed to yield $L=0$ are $d^{5}$, $f^{7}$, and $p^{3}$, corresponding to options B, D, and F.
