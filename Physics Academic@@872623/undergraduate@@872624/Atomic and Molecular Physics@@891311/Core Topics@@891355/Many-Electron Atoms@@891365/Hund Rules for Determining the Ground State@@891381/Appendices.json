This requires two main steps: first, determining the set of allowed terms using the Pauli exclusion principle, and second, ordering these terms using Hund's rules.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the allowed spectroscopic terms.**\n\nA $p^2$ configuration consists of two equivalent electrons, meaning they share the same principal quantum number $n$ and orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$. For a single $p$ electron ($l=1$), the magnetic orbital quantum number can be $m_l = \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and the magnetic spin quantum number can be $m_s = \\{-\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2}\\}$. This gives $2(2l+1) = 2(3) = 6$ possible single-electron states.\n\nFor two electrons, the Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers ($n, l, m_l, m_s$). Since the electrons are equivalent ($n_1=n_2, l_1=l_2$), they must differ in at least one of their magnetic quantum numbers, $(m_l, m_s)$. The total number of unique ways to place two electrons into these 6 states (microstates) is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15$.\n\nTo find the terms, we can construct a table of all possible microstates, specified by the total magnetic orbital quantum number $M_L = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ and the total magnetic spin quantum number $M_S = m_{s1} + m_{s2}$.\n\nLet's summarize the number of microstates for each $(M_L, M_S)$ pair:\n-   **$M_L = 2$**: Achieved only by $(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = (1, 1)$. By Pauli's principle, their spins must be opposite: $(m_{s1}, m_{s2}) = (+\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2})$. Thus, $M_S=0$. One microstate.\n-   **$M_L = 1$**: Achieved by $(1, 0)$. The spins can be parallel or antiparallel. We have $(m_{s1}, m_{s2})$ pairs $(+\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2})$, $(+\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2})$, $(-\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2})$, and $(-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2})$. These give $M_S = \\{1, 0, 0, -1\\}$. Four microstates.\n-   **$M_L = 0$**: Achieved by $(1, -1)$ or $(0, 0)$. For $(1, -1)$, spins can be anything, giving $M_S = \\{1, 0, 0, -1\\}$. For $(0, 0)$, spins must be opposite, giving $M_S = 0$. In total, for $M_L=0$, we have $M_S$ values of $\\{1, 0, 0, -1, 0\\}$, or one state with $M_S=1$, one with $M_S=-1$, and three with $M_S=0$. Five microstates.\n-   By symmetry, **$M_L = -1$** is like $M_L=1$, giving four microstates with $M_S = \\{1, 0, 0, -1\\}$.\n-   By symmetry, **$M_L = -2$** is like $M_L=2$, giving one microstate with $M_S=0$.\n\nTotal microstates = $1 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 15$, which matches our expectation.\n\nLet's arrange these counts in a table:\n| $M_L \\setminus M_S$ | +1 | 0 | -1 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| +2 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| +1 | 1 | 2 | 1 |\n| 0 | 1 | 3 | 1 |\n| -1 | 1 | 2 | 1 |\n| -2 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n\nNow, we extract the spectroscopic terms ($^{2S+1}L$) from this table.\n1.  The largest value of $M_L$ is 2. This must correspond to a term with $L=2$. For $M_L=2$, we only have a microstate with $M_S=0$. The maximum value of $M_S$ for this term is thus 0, which implies a total spin $S=0$. This gives the term $^{2(0)+1}D = {^1D}$. This term has $L=2, S=0$ and accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1)=5 \\times 1=5$ microstates, one for each $M_L \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$, all with $M_S=0$.\n\n2.  Subtracting the $^1D$ microstates from the table, we are left with:\n| $M_L \\setminus M_S$ | +1 | 0 | -1 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| +1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 |\n| -1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\n3.  The largest remaining $M_L$ is 1, which implies a term with $L=1$. For $M_L=1$, we have microstates with $M_S \\in \\{1, 0, -1\\}$. The maximum value of $M_S$ is 1, implying a total spin $S=1$. This gives the term $^{2(1)+1}P = {^3P}$. This term has $L=1, S=1$ and accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1)=3 \\times 3=9$ microstates, corresponding to all combinations of $M_L \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and $M_S \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\n4.  Subtracting the $^3P$ microstates leaves one microstate at $(M_L=0, M_S=0)$. This corresponds to a term with $L=0$ and $S=0$, which is $^{2(0)+1}S = {^1S}$.\n\nThus, the allowed spectroscopic terms for the $p^2$ configuration are $^1S, ^3P, \\text{and} ^1D$.\n\n**Step 2: Order the terms by energy using Hund's Rules.**\n\n**Hund's First Rule:** The term with the highest spin multiplicity ($2S+1$) has the lowest energy.\n-   $^3P$ term has $S=1$, so multiplicity is $2(1)+1=3$.\n-   $^1D$ term has $S=0$, so multiplicity is $2(0)+1=1$.\n-   $^1S$ term has $S=0$, so multiplicity is $2(0)+1=1$.\nThe $^3P$ term has the highest multiplicity, so it is the lowest in energy.\n$E(^3P) < E(^1D)$ and $E(^3P) < E(^1S)$.\n\n**Hund's Second Rule:** For terms with the same spin multiplicity, the term with the highest total orbital angular momentum quantum number ($L$) has the lower energy.\n-   We compare the $^1D$ and $^1S$ terms, as both have multiplicity 1.\n-   For $^1D$, $L=2$. The letter D corresponds to $L=2$.\n-   For $^1S$, $L=0$. The letter S corresponds to $L=0$.\nSince $2 > 0$, the $^1D$ term is lower in energy than the $^1S$ term.\n$E(^1D) < E(^1S)$.\n\n**Combining the rules:**\nCombining the energy orderings from both rules, we get the final sequence of increasing energy:\n$E(^3P) < E(^1D) < E(^1S)$.\n\nThe list of terms, arranged in order of increasing energy, is $^3P, ^1D, ^1S$.
