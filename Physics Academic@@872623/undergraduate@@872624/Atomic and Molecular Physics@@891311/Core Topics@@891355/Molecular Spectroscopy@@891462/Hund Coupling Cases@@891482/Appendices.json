This practice focuses on the underlying physics, contrasting the two extreme scenarios of Hund's case (a) and case (c).

Let $\\vec{L}$ be the total electronic orbital angular momentum and $\\vec{S}$ be the total electronic spin angular momentum. The strong electric field along the internuclear axis plays a crucial role in these coupling schemes, as does the spin-orbit interaction which couples $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$.\n\nConsider the following two scenarios describing the relative strengths of these interactions:\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** The coupling of the electronic orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ to the internuclear axis is much stronger than the spin-orbit interaction. The spin angular momentum $\\vec{S}$ also couples to the axis, but primarily through the magnetic field generated along it.\n*   **Scenario 2:** The spin-orbit interaction, which couples $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$ together, is much stronger than the interaction of either $\\vec{L}$ or $\\vec{S}$ individually with the internuclear axis. This situation is typical for molecules containing heavy atoms.\n\nThese two scenarios correspond to Hund's case (a) and Hund's case (c). Your task is to correctly identify the physical description of the angular momentum coupling for each case. Which of the following statements provides the correct description?\n\nA. In case (a), $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$ first couple to form a resultant total electronic angular momentum $\\vec{J}_a$, which then precesses around the internuclear axis. In case (c), $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$ precess independently around the internuclear axis.\n\nB. In case (a), $\\vec{L}$ precesses around the internuclear axis, while $\\vec{S}$ couples to the rotational angular momentum vector of the nuclei. In case (c), $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$ precess independently around the internuclear axis.\n\nC. In case (a), $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$ precess independently around the internuclear axis. In case (c), $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$ first couple to form a resultant total electronic angular momentum $\\vec{J}_a$, which then precesses around the internuclear axis.\n\nD. In both case (a) and case (c), $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$ couple to each other first to form a resultant $\\vec{J}_a$. The difference is that in case (a) this resultant is weakly coupled to the internuclear axis, while in case (c) it is strongly coupled.\n\nE. In case (a), the total electronic angular momentum $\\vec{J}_a = \\vec{L}+\\vec{S}$ is not a well-defined quantity. In case (c), the individual projections of $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$ onto the internuclear axis are the well-defined quantum numbers.", "solution": "We compare the dominant interactions to determine which angular momenta couple first and which projections are good quantum numbers.

Thus $\\Lambda$ is a good quantum number due to strong coupling of $\\vec{L}$ to the axis, and $\\Sigma$ is also (approximately or effectively) a good quantum number because $\\vec{S}$ is tied to the axis by the field and spin-orbit effects. Therefore $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$ each precess primarily and independently about the internuclear axis, and the primary well-defined quantities are $\\Lambda$, $\\Sigma$, and $\\Omega = \\Lambda + \\Sigma$. In this situation, $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$ do not first couple strongly to each other to form $\\vec{J}_{a}$; rather, their individual projections on the axis are well defined, and the axis coupling dominates before spin-orbit coupling mixes them.\n\nScenario 2 corresponds to Hund’s case (c): $H_{\\text{SO}}$ is much stronger than the individual couplings of $\\vec{L}$ or $\\vec{S}$ to the axis. The eigenstates are first characterized by the strong $\\vec{L}\\cdot\\vec{S}$ coupling, so $\\vec{J}_{a}=\\vec{L}+\\vec{S}$ is the primary resultant. The weaker axis interaction then couples this resultant to the internuclear axis, making the projection $\\Omega = \\vec{J}_{a}\\cdot\\hat{a}/\\hbar$ the good quantum number. In this regime, the individual projections $\\Lambda$ and $\\Sigma$ are not good quantum numbers, and it is the coupled vector $\\vec{J}_{a}$ that precesses about the internuclear axis.\n\nComparing with the statements:\n- Case (a): $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$ precess independently around the internuclear axis (good $\\Lambda$ and $\\Sigma$).\n- Case (c): $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$ first couple to form $\\vec{J}_{a}$, which then precesses around the internuclear axis (good $\\Omega$).\n\nThis matches statement C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1995488"}, {"introduction": "With a conceptual framework in place, we can now apply it to a quantitative problem typical in molecular spectroscopy.
