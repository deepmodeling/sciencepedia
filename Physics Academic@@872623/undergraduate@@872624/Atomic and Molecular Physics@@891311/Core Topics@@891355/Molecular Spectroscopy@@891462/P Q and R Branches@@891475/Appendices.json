The spectrum reveals distinct rotational-vibrational bands. The relative intensities of the individual spectral lines within these bands provide crucial information about the temperature of the cloud.\n\nConsider a diatomic molecule within this cloud, which can be modeled as a rigid rotor. The energy of a rotational level with quantum number $J$ is given by $E_J = B J(J+1)$, where $B$ is the rotational constant of the molecule expressed in Joules. Each rotational level $J$ has a degeneracy of $g_J = 2J+1$.
