The overall appearance of this band—whether it forms a sharp edge (a band head) and shades off towards higher or lower energies—is determined by the change in the molecule's bond length upon excitation. This practice explores the connection between the rotational constants ($B'$ and $B''$) and the resulting structure of the observed spectral band [@problem_id:1990372].", "problem": "In the analysis of the electronic absorption spectrum of a diatomic molecule, we observe a specific rovibronic band corresponding to a transition from a lower electronic state (denoted by double primes, $''$) to an upper electronic state (denoted by single primes, $'$). Let $B''$ be the rotational constant of the molecule in the lower electronic state and $B'$ be the rotational constant in the upper electronic state. For this particular transition, experimental analysis reveals that the bond length in the excited state is shorter than in the ground state, which implies that $B' > B''$.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements correctly describes the appearance of this electronic band?\n\nA. A band head forms in the R-branch, and the band is degraded to the red (i.e., shaded towards lower wavenumbers).\n\nB.

A band head forms in the P-branch, and the band is degraded to the red (i.e., shaded towards lower wavenumbers).\n\nE. No band head is formed; the P- and R-branch lines appear as two series of lines spreading away from the band origin.", "solution": "The wavenumber $\\nu$ of a line in a rovibronic spectrum is given by the sum of the electronic, vibrational, and rotational energy differences. For a given electronic and vibrational transition, the wavenumbers of the rotational lines are given by:\n$$ \\nu = \\nu_0 + F'(J') - F''(J'') $$\nwhere $\\nu_0$ is the band origin (the wavenumber of the pure vibronic transition without rotation), $F'(J') = B'J'(J'+1)$ is the rotational term value for the upper electronic state, and $F''(J'') = B''J''(J''+1)$ is the rotational term value for the lower electronic state. $J'$ and $J''$ are the rotational quantum numbers for the upper and lower states, respectively.\n\nWe consider the two main branches of the spectrum, the R-branch and the P-branch.\n\nFor the R-branch, the selection rule is $\\Delta J = J' - J'' = +1$. Thus, $J' = J''+1$. Let's use $J$ to denote the rotational quantum number of the lower state, $J''$. So, $J''=J$ and $J'=J+1$. The line positions are:\n$$ \\nu_R(J) = \\nu_0 + B'(J+1)(J+2) - B''J(J+1) \\quad \\text{for } J=0, 1, 2, ... $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\nu_R(J) = \\nu_0 + (B'+B'') (J+1) + (B'-B'') (J+1)^2 $$\n\nFor the P-branch, the selection rule is $\\Delta J = J' - J'' = -1$. Thus, $J' = J''-1$. Again, using $J$ for $J''$, we have $J''=J$ and $J'=J-1$. The line positions are:\n$$ \\nu_P(J) = \\nu_0 + B'(J-1)J - B''J(J+1) \\quad \\text{for } J=1, 2, 3, ... $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\nu_P(J) = \\nu_0 - (B'+B'') J + (B'-B'') J^2 $$\n\nA band head is formed if the spacing between consecutive lines decreases, becomes zero, and then reverses sign. This corresponds to the vertex of the Fortrat parabola, a plot of $\\nu$ versus a running number $m$ (where $m=J+1$ for the R-branch and $m=-J$ for the P-branch). We can find the location of the vertex by treating $J$ as a continuous variable and finding where the derivative of the wavenumber with respect to $J$ is zero.\n\nLet's analyze the R-branch first. We take the derivative of $\\nu_R(J)$ with respect to $J$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\nu_R}{dJ} = (B'+B'') + 2(B'-B'')(J+1) $$\nWe are given that $B' > B''$, which means $B'-B'' > 0$. Also, $B'+B'' > 0$ and $J \\geq 0$. Therefore, every term on the right-hand side is positive. This means $\\frac{d\\nu_R}{dJ}$ is always positive, so the R-branch lines continuously spread out towards higher wavenumbers without forming a head.\n\nNow, let's analyze the P-branch. We take the derivative of $\\nu_P(J)$ with respect to $J$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\nu_P}{dJ} = -(B'+B'') + 2(B'-B'')J $$\nSetting this derivative to zero to find the value of $J$ at the band head ($J_{head}$):\n$$ 2(B'-B'')J_{head} = B'+B'' $$\n$$ J_{head} = \\frac{B'+B''}{2(B'-B'')} $$\nSince we are given $B' > B''$, the denominator $(B'-B'')$ is positive. The numerator $(B'+B'')$ is also positive. Therefore, $J_{head}$ is a positive, physical value. This confirms that a band head forms in the P-branch.\n\nTo determine the direction of degradation, we examine the position of the head and the direction of the tail. The head occurs at $J_{head}$ in the P-branch. The P-branch lines start at $J=1$ and move in the direction of decreasing wavenumber (since for small $J$, the term $-(B'+B'')J$ dominates). They reach a minimum wavenumber at $J_{head}$ (the band head) and then \"turn back\" toward higher wavenumbers for $J > J_{head}$. The R-branch, as we found, always extends to higher wavenumbers.\n\nTherefore, the spectrum has a sharp edge (the head) on the low-wavenumber (red) side, formed by the turning point of the P-branch. Both the remainder of the P-branch and the entire R-branch extend out to higher wavenumbers (the violet side). This appearance, with a sharp red-side edge and a diffuse tail extending to the violet, is called \"degradation to the violet\".\n\nThus, a band head forms in the P-branch, and the band is degraded to the violet.
