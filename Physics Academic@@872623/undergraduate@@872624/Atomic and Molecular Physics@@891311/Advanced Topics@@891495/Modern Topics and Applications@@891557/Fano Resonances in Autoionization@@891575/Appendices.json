This probability, or cross-section, displays a unique asymmetric profile known as a Fano resonance, which arises from the quantum interference between direct ionization and the autoionization pathway. This exercise [@problem_id:1991785] challenges you to interpret the physical meaning behind this characteristic shape by analyzing a special case of the Fano parameter $q$.", "problem": "An atomic physicist is studying the photoionization of a neutral atom. The absorption spectrum is measured as a function of the incident photon energy, $E$. In the energy range of interest, the atom can be ionized by a direct transition to a continuum of states. However, within this same energy range, a discrete, doubly-excited electronic state also exists. This discrete state is coupled to the continuum, allowing for a process called autoionization, where the atom is first excited to the discrete state, which then decays by ejecting an electron.\n\nThe quantum interference between the direct photoionization pathway and the indirect autoionization pathway gives rise to an asymmetric resonance shape in the photoionization cross-section, $\\sigma(E)$. This shape is described by the Fano profile:\n$$\n\\sigma(E) = \\sigma_{bg} \\frac{(q + \\epsilon)^2}{1 + \\epsilon^2}\n$$\nHere, $\\sigma_{bg}$ is the background cross-section corresponding to the direct ionization process, $\\epsilon = (E - E_r)/(\\Gamma/2)$ is the reduced energy relative to the resonance energy $E_r$, $\\Gamma$ is the width of the resonance, and $q$ is a dimensionless shape parameter known as the Fano parameter.\n\nUpon analyzing a particular resonance, the physicist's data conclusively shows that the Fano parameter for this transition is $q=0$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical interpretation of this observation ($q=0$) and the resulting absorption spectrum?\n\nA. The absorption cross-section becomes a symmetric Lorentzian peak centered at $E=E_r$. This occurs because the direct transition to the continuum is forbidden, and only the transition to the discrete state is allowed.\n\nB. The direct transition via photon absorption from the ground state to the discrete autoionizing state is forbidden. At the resonance energy $E_r$, perfect destructive interference occurs, causing the absorption cross-section to drop to zero and creating a \"window resonance\".\n\nC. The transition amplitudes for the direct path to the continuum and the indirect path via the discrete state are exactly equal and in phase. This leads to perfect constructive interference, causing an infinitely sharp absorption peak at $E=E_r$.\n\nD. The resonance has an infinitely wide energy profile ($\\Gamma \\to \\infty$). The atom is ionized instantaneously, and the concept of a discrete state loses its meaning, resulting in a flat, featureless absorption spectrum.\n\nE. The Fano parameter being zero indicates that the system cannot be described by quantum mechanics. The observed cross-section would hence be a random, noisy signal with no discernible features.", "solution": "The starting point is the Fano profile for the photoionization cross-section,\n$$\n\\sigma(E) = \\sigma_{bg} \\frac{(q+\\epsilon)^{2}}{1+\\epsilon^{2}},\n$$\nwith $\\epsilon = \\frac{E - E_{r}}{\\Gamma/2}$. The parameter $q$ encodes the relative transition amplitude (including phase) for excitation of the discrete (autoionizing) component versus the direct excitation of the continuum. In Fano’s formalism, $q$ is proportional to the ratio of two dipole transition amplitudes, schematically $q \\propto \\frac{\\langle \\text{discrete} | \\hat{D} | g \\rangle}{\\langle \\text{continuum} | \\hat{D} | g \\rangle}$ (up to an energy-dependent phase arising from the continuum coupling). Thus, $q=0$ implies that the direct dipole transition amplitude from the ground state to the discrete autoionizing state vanishes, while the direct continuum matrix element is nonzero.\n\nSet $q=0$ in the Fano formula:\n$$\n\\sigma(E) = \\sigma_{bg} \\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{1+\\epsilon^{2}}.\n$$\nEvaluate at resonance, $\\epsilon = 0$:\n$$\n\\sigma(E_{r}) = \\sigma_{bg} \\frac{0^{2}}{1+0^{2}} = 0.\n$$\nThus at $E=E_{r}$ the cross-section vanishes due to perfect destructive interference between the modified continuum amplitude (affected by coupling to the discrete state) and the background continuum amplitude.

The two pathways then interfere destructively exactly at $E=E_{r}$, driving the cross-section to zero. This matches the statement that the direct transition to the discrete state is forbidden and a window resonance appears at $E_{r}$.\n\nBy contrast:\n- A describes a symmetric Lorentzian peak, which corresponds to $|q| \\to \\infty$ (dominant discrete excitation) rather than $q=0$.\n- C is incorrect because the width remains $\\Gamma$; there is no infinitely sharp peak and $q=0$ gives a dip, not constructive interference.\n- D incorrectly ties $q=0$ to $\\Gamma \\to \\infty$; $\\Gamma$ is independent of $q$.\n- E is incorrect; $q=0$ is a well-defined quantum-mechanical regime yielding a characteristic window resonance.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1991785"}, {"introduction": "We have seen that energy conservation determines the possible kinetic energies of an ejected electron.
