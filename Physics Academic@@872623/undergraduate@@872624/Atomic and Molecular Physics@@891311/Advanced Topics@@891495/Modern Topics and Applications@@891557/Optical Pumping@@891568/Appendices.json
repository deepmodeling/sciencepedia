A laser beam illuminates a sample of these atoms, which are all initially in the state $|g_1\\rangle$.\n\nThe laser is resonant with the $|g_1\\rangle \\to |e\\rangle$ transition. The process is as follows: an atom in $|g_1\\rangle$ absorbs a photon and is promoted to $|e\\rangle$. This absorption occurs with a rate constant $R_{abs}$. The excited state $|e\\rangle$ then decays spontaneously. A fraction $b$ of these decays are to the dark state $|g_2\\rangle$, while the remaining fraction $(1-b)$ returns the atom to the initial state $|g_1\\rangle$.

For electric dipole transitions driven by a spherical polarization component $q \\in \\{-1,0,+1\\}$, the selection rule is $\\Delta m_{F} = q$ for absorption from $\\lvert F,m_{F}\\rangle$ to $\\lvert F',m_{F}'\\rangle$ with $m_{F}' = m_{F}+q$, and the coupling matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient\n$$\n\\langle F' m_{F}' \\lvert d_{q} \\rvert F m_{F} \\rangle \\propto C(F\\, m_{F},\\, 1\\, q \\mid F' \\, m_{F}').\n$$\nSpontaneous emission from the excited state allows $\\Delta m_{F} = 0,\\pm 1$ back to the ground state.\n\nExperiment 1 uses $\\sigma^{+}$ light, i.e., $q=+1$, propagating along the quantization axis. Thus only $\\Delta m_{F} = +1$ absorptions occur: $m_{F}\\to m_{F}'=m_{F}+1$, provided that the target excited sublevel exists. For $F=2 \\to F'=2$, the excited state magnetic sublevels are $m_{F}'\\in\\{-2,-1,0,+1,+2\\}$. Therefore the ground sublevel $m_{F}=+2$ would require $m_{F}'=+3$ for absorption with $q=+1$, which does not exist; equivalently, the dipole matrix element vanishes by the selection rule. Hence $\\lvert F=2,m_{F}=+2\\rangle$ is a dark state under $\\sigma^{+}$ driving. All other ground sublevels $m_{F}\\in\\{-2,-1,0,+1\\}$ are bright: they are excited to $m_{F}'=m_{F}+1$ and then spontaneously decay with $\\Delta m_{F} = 0,\\pm 1$ back to ground, i.e., to $m_{F}''\\in\\{m_{F},\\, m_{F}+1,\\, m_{F}+2\\}$ subject to the allowed range. Each absorption step increases $m_{F}$ by $+1$, while spontaneous emission can change $m_{F}$ by at most $\\pm 1$ or $0$, so repeated cycles produce a net drift toward higher $m_{F}$. Since $m_{F}=+2$ is the only uncoupled ground state, the population accumulates there. After long time, the steady state is\n$$\nP(+2)=1,\\quad P(m_{F}\\neq +2)=0.\n$$\n\nExperiment 2 uses linearly polarized light parallel to the quantization axis, i.e., pure $\\pi$ polarization with $q=0$. Thus only $\\Delta m_{F}=0$ absorptions occur: $m_{F}\\to m_{F}'=m_{F}$. The coupling strength is set by the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient $C(F\\, m_{F},\\, 1\\, 0 \\mid F'\\, m_{F})$. For the case $F'=F$, one has the identity\n$$\nC(F\\, m_{F},\\, 1\\, 0 \\mid F\\, m_{F}) = \\frac{m_{F}}{\\sqrt{F(F+1)}},\n$$\nwhich vanishes exactly for $m_{F}=0$ and is nonzero for $m_{F}=\\pm 1,\\pm 2$. Therefore the ground sublevel $\\lvert F=2,m_{F}=0\\rangle$ is a dark state under $\\pi$ driving for the $F=2\\to F'=2$ transition, while all other ground sublevels are bright. From any bright $m_{F}\\neq 0$, absorption takes the atom to the corresponding excited $m_{F}'=m_{F}$, and spontaneous emission returns it to ground with $\\Delta m_{F}=0,\\pm 1$, so $m_{F}''\\in\\{m_{F}-1,\\, m_{F},\\, m_{F}+1\\}$. These decay paths include population transfer into $m_{F}''=0$. Once an atom reaches $\\lvert F=2,m_{F}=0\\rangle$, it cannot be re-excited because the $\\pi$-transition matrix element is zero. Hence optical pumping drives all population into the unique dark state $m_{F}=0$.
