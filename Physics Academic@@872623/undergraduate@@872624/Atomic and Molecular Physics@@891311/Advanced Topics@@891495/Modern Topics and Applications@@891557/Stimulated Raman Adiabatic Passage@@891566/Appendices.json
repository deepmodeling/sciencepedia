States $|1\\rangle$ and $|3\\rangle$ are long-lived, nearly degenerate ground states, while state $|2\\rangle$ is an unstable excited state, forming a so-called $\\Lambda$-system. The goal is to transfer the entire atomic population from state $|1\\rangle$ to state $|3\\rangle$ efficiently.\n\nTo achieve this, a technique known as Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) is employed. This method uses two coherent laser pulses: a \"pump\" pulse with a time-dependent Rabi frequency $\\Omega_P(t)$ that couples states $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$, and a \"Stokes\" pulse with Rabi frequency $\\Omega_S(t)$ that couples states $|2\\rangle$ and $|3\\rangle$. The system is initially prepared entirely in state $|1\\rangle$. The STIRAP protocol requires a \"counter-intuitive\" pulse sequence, where the Stokes pulse partially precedes the pump pulse.\n\nLet $P_1(t)$, $P_2(t)$, and $P_3(t)$ represent the populations in states $|1\\rangle$, $|2\\rangle$, and $|3\\rangle$ as a function of time, respectively. Assume the process is ideal, meaning the evolution is perfectly adiabatic and there are no sources of decoherence or population loss.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the time evolution of the populations during this ideal STIRAP process?\n\nA. The pump pulse transfers the population from state $|1\\rangle$ to state $|2\\rangle$, after which the Stokes pulse transfers the population from state $|2\\rangle$ to state $|3\\rangle$. At an intermediate time, the population resides almost entirely in state $|2\\rangle$.\n\nB. Population is coherently transferred from state $|1\\rangle$ to state $|3\\rangle$ such that the population of state $|2\\rangle$ remains zero throughout the entire process. The population of state $|1\\rangle$ decreases monotonically, while the population of state $|3\\rangle$ increases monotonically until the transfer is complete.\n\nC. The system undergoes rapid Rabi oscillations involving all three states. The populations $P_1(t)$, $P_2(t)$, and $P_3(t)$ oscillate significantly with time, and a complete population transfer to state $|3\\rangle$ is not achieved.\n\nD. The population is transferred from $|1\\rangle$ to $|3\\rangle$, but the system must briefly populate state $|2\\rangle$ for the transfer to occur.
