By analyzing the consequence of switching from the standard \"red-detuning\" to \"blue-detuning,\" you will gain a deeper intuition for why Doppler cooling slows atoms down, while the opposite configuration leads to heating.", "problem": "An atom of mass $m$ possesses a single strong optical transition with a natural resonance angular frequency $\\omega_0$. To slow it down, the atom is placed in a one-dimensional optical molasses setup. This consists of two identical, counter-propagating laser beams directed along the x-axis. Both lasers are tuned to the same angular frequency $\\omega_L$.\n\nInitially, the atom is moving along the positive x-axis with a non-relativistic velocity $v$. The lasers are red-detuned, meaning their frequency $\\omega_L$ is slightly lower than the atomic resonance, i.e., the detuning $\\delta = \\omega_L - \\omega_0$ is a small negative value. This configuration produces a net force on the atom that opposes its motion, a process known as Doppler cooling.\n\nImagine that at a specific moment, the frequency of both lasers is instantaneously changed to a new value, $\\omega'_L$, such that the new detuning, $\\delta' = \\omega'_L - \\omega_0$, is positive and has the same magnitude as the initial detuning (i.e., $\\delta' = -\\delta  0$).

For the initial red detuning $\\delta  0$ and $v  0$, $F(\\delta,v)  0$, which is a damping force opposing the motion. After the switch to blue detuning $\\delta'  0$ with the same magnitude, $F(\\delta',v) = -F(\\delta,v)  0$, which points along $+x$, i.e., in the same direction as the atom’s velocity.
