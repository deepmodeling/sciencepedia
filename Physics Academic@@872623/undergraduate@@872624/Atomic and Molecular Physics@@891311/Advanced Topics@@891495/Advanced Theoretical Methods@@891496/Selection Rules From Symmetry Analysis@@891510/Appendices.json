The character table for this point group is given below, where $A_1, A_2, B_1$, and $B_2$ are the irreducible representations (irreps).

The activity of a mode can change because the increased mass of deuterium alters the symmetry of the vibrational motions.\nB. The activity of a mode cannot change because the molecular point group, which dictates the selection rules, is determined by the molecular geometry and not the atomic masses.\nC. All modes in D₂O will become Raman active, and all modes in H₂O are IR active, representing a fundamental change in selection rules.\nD. The activity of a mode can change because the change in vibrational frequencies shifts them into or out of the regions where they can be observed by IR or Raman spectroscopy.\nE. Only the activity of the stretching modes will change, while the bending mode's activity will remain the same, due to the larger relative mass change on the atoms involved in stretching.", "solution": "The core of this problem lies in understanding what determines the symmetry of a molecule and its vibrational modes, and how this symmetry dictates spectroscopic selection rules.\n\nFirst, we must identify what governs the classification of a molecule into a point group. A molecule's point group is determined by the set of symmetry elements (like rotation axes, mirror planes, centers of inversion) that leave the molecule's equilibrium geometry unchanged. The problem statement explicitly notes that the equilibrium bond lengths and angles of $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ and $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ are essentially identical. Therefore, the spatial arrangement of the atomic nuclei is the same for both molecules. Since symmetry is a property of this geometry, both $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ and $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ belong to the same point group, $C_{2v}$, as stated.\n\nNext, we consider the selection rules for Infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy. These rules are a direct consequence of the symmetry of the molecule, encapsulated by its point group.\n- For a vibrational mode to be IR active, the transition dipole moment integral must be non-zero. Group theory shows this is only possible if the irreducible representation (irrep) of the vibrational mode transforms as one of the Cartesian coordinates ($x, y$, or $z$).\n- For a vibrational mode to be Raman active, the transition polarizability integral must be non-zero. This is only possible if the irrep of the vibrational mode transforms as one of the quadratic functions ($x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz$).\n\nThe character table for the $C_{2v}$ point group, provided in the problem, dictates how these basis functions ($x, y, z$, etc.) transform. For example, any mode with $A_1$ symmetry will be IR active (because $z$ transforms as $A_1$) and Raman active (because $x^2, y^2$, and $z^2$ transform as $A_1$). Any mode with $B_2$ symmetry will be IR active (transforms as $y$) and Raman active (transforms as $yz$).\n\nThe final piece is to understand the symmetry of the vibrational modes themselves. The normal modes of vibration (e.g., symmetric stretch, asymmetric stretch, bend) are collective motions of the atoms that also have specific symmetries. These symmetries are determined by the molecular geometry and atomic displacement vectors. Since $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ and $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ have the same geometry and point group, their corresponding vibrational modes will have identical symmetries. For instance, the symmetric stretching mode in $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ has $A_1$ symmetry, and the symmetric stretching mode in $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ *also* has $A_1$ symmetry. The same holds for the bending mode ($A_1$) and the asymmetric stretching mode ($B_2$).\n\nBecause:\n1.  $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ and $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ belong to the same point group ($C_{2v}$).\n2.  The selection rules for IR and Raman activity depend only on the character table of this point group.\n3.  The corresponding vibrational modes in $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ and $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ have the same symmetry irreps.\n\n...it follows that the IR and Raman activity of any given mode *cannot* change upon isotopic substitution. The symmetric stretch is $A_1$ in both molecules, and $A_1$ is always IR and Raman active according to the $C_{2v}$ table. The asymmetric stretch is $B_2$ in both, and $B_2$ is always IR and Raman active.\n\nWhat *does* change is the vibrational frequency. Modes involving the heavier deuterium isotope will have lower frequencies than the corresponding modes with hydrogen, because frequency is dependent on the reduced mass of the vibrating system. However, this change in frequency does not affect the symmetry-determined \"allowedness\" (activity) of the mode.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect. Mass does not determine symmetry; the geometric arrangement of the nuclei does.\n- B is correct. It correctly identifies that the point group is unchanged because it depends on geometry, not mass, and that this is the determining factor for selection rules.\n- C is an incorrect and arbitrary statement.\n- D is a common misconception. It confuses activity (a binary property: allowed or forbidden by symmetry) with experimental observability or the frequency value itself. A mode can be symmetry-allowed but too weak to see, or outside the range of a particular instrument, but its fundamental activity is unchanged.\n- E is incorrect. The symmetry analysis applies to all modes equally, regardless of whether they are stretches or bends.\n\nTherefore, the isotopic substitution from $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ to $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ does not alter the IR or Raman activity of the fundamental vibrations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2021487"}]}
