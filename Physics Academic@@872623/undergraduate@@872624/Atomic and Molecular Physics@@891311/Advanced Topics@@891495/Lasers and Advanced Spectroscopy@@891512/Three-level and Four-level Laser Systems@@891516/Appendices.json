Before any lasing can occur, a population inversion must be established, but this is only possible if the energy level lifetimes are suitable.

Consider one such proposed system based on a gas of atoms with three relevant energy levels: a ground state $E_1$, a metastable intermediate state $E_2$, and an excited state $E_3$, such that $E_1  E_2  E_3$.\n\nAn external energy source, the pump, excites atoms from the ground state $E_1$ to the upper state $E_3$. It is proposed that lasing could occur on the transition from $E_3$ to $E_2$. The lifetimes associated with the spontaneous decay pathways are known:\n- The lifetime for the transition from $E_3$ to $E_2$ is $\\tau_{32} = 12.0 \\text{ ns}$.\n- The lifetime for the transition from $E_3$ to $E_1$ is $\\tau_{31} = 48.0 \\text{ ns}$.\n- The lifetime for the transition from the metastable state $E_2$ to $E_1$ is $\\tau_{21} = 1.50 \\text{ ms}$.\n\nLet $N_2$ and $N_3$ be the number of atoms in states $E_2$ and $E_3$, respectively. Assuming the system has reached a steady state due to continuous pumping but that stimulated emission has not yet become significant (i.e., we are evaluating the condition for achieving population inversion), which one of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. Population inversion is achieved, as the population ratio $N_3/N_2$ is significantly greater than 1.\n\nB. Population inversion is not achieved, as the population ratio $N_3/N_2$ is significantly less than 1.\n\nC. The system is at the threshold of population inversion, with a population ratio $N_3/N_2$ approximately equal to 1.\n\nD.
