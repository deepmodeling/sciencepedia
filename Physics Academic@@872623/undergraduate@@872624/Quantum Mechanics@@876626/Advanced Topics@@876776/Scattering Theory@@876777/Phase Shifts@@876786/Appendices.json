This exercise is essential for building a concrete understanding of where phase shifts come from.", "problem": "A non-relativistic particle of mass $m$ is undergoing low-energy scattering in three dimensions. The interaction between the particle and a scattering center is described by a simplified model potential that is spherically symmetric. This potential is a repulsive delta-function shell located at a radius $R$ from the origin, given by $V(r) = \\alpha \\delta(r-R)$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive constant representing the strength of the repulsive interaction, and $\\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nWe are interested in the case of s-wave scattering, corresponding to the angular momentum quantum number $l=0$. For a particle with incident wave number $k$, the radial part of the wave function, $u(r) = r\\psi(r)$, has the asymptotic form $u(r) \\propto C\\sin(kr + \\delta_0)$ for $r \\to \\infty$, where $\\delta_0$ is the s-wave phase shift.\n\nAssuming the particle's energy is low such that $kR \\ll 1$, derive the leading-order expression for $\\tan(\\delta_0)$.
