If any term in the series can be complex, then the T-matrix element will, in general, be complex.\n\n**1. Analysis of the First Born Approximation**\n\nThe first term in the series is the first Born approximation, $T^{(1)} = V$. Let's analyze its matrix element $T^{(1)}(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{p}; E) = \\langle \\mathbf{p'} | V | \\mathbf{p} \\rangle$.\nFor a local potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$, this matrix element is given by the Fourier transform of the potential:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{p'} | V | \\mathbf{p} \\rangle = \\int d^3r \\, \\langle \\mathbf{p'} | \\mathbf{r} \\rangle V(\\mathbf{r}) \\langle \\mathbf{r} | \\mathbf{p} \\rangle = \\int d^3r \\, \\frac{e^{-i\\mathbf{p'}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}/\\hbar}}{(2\\pi\\hbar)^{3/2}} V(\\mathbf{r}) \\frac{e^{i\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}/\\hbar}}{(2\\pi\\hbar)^{3/2}} $$\n$$ V(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{p}) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\hbar)^3} \\int d^3r \\, V(\\mathbf{r}) e^{-i(\\mathbf{p'}-\\mathbf{p})\\cdot\\mathbf{r}/\\hbar} = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\hbar)^3} \\tilde{V}(\\mathbf{p'}-\\mathbf{p}) $$\nThe problem states that $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is a real-valued function. The Fourier transform $\\tilde{V}(\\mathbf{q})$ of a real function $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is not necessarily a real function. It satisfies the property $\\tilde{V}(\\mathbf{q})^* = \\tilde{V}(-\\mathbf{q})$.\nFor $V(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{p})$ to be real, we require $V(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{p}) = V(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{p})^*$. With $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{p'}-\\mathbf{p}$, this means $\\tilde{V}(\\mathbf{q}) = \\tilde{V}(\\mathbf{q})^* = \\tilde{V}(-\\mathbf{q})$. This condition holds if and only if the potential is also centrosymmetric, i.e., $V(\\mathbf{r}) = V(-\\mathbf{r})$.\nHowever, the problem only specifies a \"local, real\" potential, not necessarily a centrosymmetric one. For a real potential that lacks inversion symmetry (e.g., a potential with a dipole moment), $V(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{p})$ will be a complex-valued function.\nSince the first term of the Born series is not guaranteed to be real, the T-matrix element itself is not guaranteed to be real. This alone is sufficient to show the statement is false.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Second Born Approximation for Centrosymmetric Potentials**\n\nLet's consider the more restrictive case of a real, local, and centrosymmetric potential, for which $V(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{p})$ is real. We now examine the second term in the Born series, $T^{(2)} = V G_0(E) V$. Its matrix element is:\n$$ T^{(2)}(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{p}; E) = \\langle \\mathbf{p'} | V G_0(E) V | \\mathbf{p} \\rangle $$\nInserting a complete set of momentum states $|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle$:\n$$ T^{(2)}(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{p}; E) = \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} \\langle \\mathbf{p'} | V | \\mathbf{k} \\rangle \\langle \\mathbf{k} | G_0(E) | \\mathbf{k} \\rangle \\langle \\mathbf{k} | V | \\mathbf{p} \\rangle $$\nUsing $\\langle \\mathbf{k} | G_0(E) | \\mathbf{k} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{E - k^2/(2m) + i\\epsilon}$, the expression becomes:\n$$ T^{(2)}(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{p}; E) = \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} V(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{k}) \\frac{1}{E - k^2/(2m) + i\\epsilon} V(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{p}) $$\nWe now analyze the reality of this term. The potential matrix elements $V(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{k})$ and $V(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{p})$ are real by our assumption in this section. The complex nature of $T^{(2)}$ is determined by the propagator term. Using the Sokhotski-Plemelj theorem (or Plemelj-Sokhotski formula):\n$$ \\frac{1}{x \\pm i\\epsilon} = \\mathcal{P}\\frac{1}{x} \\mp i\\pi\\delta(x) $$\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}$ denotes the Cauchy principal value. The propagator becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E - k^2/(2m) + i\\epsilon} = \\mathcal{P}\\left(\\frac{1}{E - k^2/(2m)}\\right) - i\\pi\\delta(E - k^2/(2m)) $$\nThis shows the propagator has a real part and an imaginary part.\nThe imaginary part of $T^{(2)}$ is:\n$$ \\text{Im}[T^{(2)}(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{p}; E)] = \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} V(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{k}) V(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{p}) \\left[-\\pi\\delta(E - k^2/(2m))\\right] $$\nThe delta function $\\delta(E - k^2/(2m))$ is non-zero only for intermediate states $|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle$ that are on the energy shell, i.e., $k^2/(2m) = E$. This is only possible if the scattering energy $E$ is positive ($E>0$). The phrase \"below any inelastic thresholds\" includes the entire elastic scattering regime, which typically corresponds to $E>0$.\nFor any $E>0$ and a generic non-zero potential $V$, the integral will be non-zero. For instance, for a simple attractive Yukawa potential, the potential matrix elements are real and positive, so the entire integrand for the imaginary part is non-zero and negative over the energy shell, making the integral non-zero.\nTherefore, even for a real, centrosymmetric potential, the second Born term is complex for $E>0$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe T-matrix is not always a real function for a local, real potential.\n1. If the potential is not centrosymmetric, the first Born term $V(\\mathbf{p'}, \\mathbf{p})$ can itself be complex.\n2. Even if the potential is centrosymmetric, making the first Born term real, higher-order terms in the Born series are generally complex for scattering energies $E>0$ due to the on-shell propagating intermediate states, which introduce an imaginary part into the free Green's function.\n\nSince we have found general conditions under which the T-matrix is complex, the statement that it is *always* real is false.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0} $$", "id": "1203402"}, {"introduction": "The power of the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism extends far beyond particles moving in free space.
