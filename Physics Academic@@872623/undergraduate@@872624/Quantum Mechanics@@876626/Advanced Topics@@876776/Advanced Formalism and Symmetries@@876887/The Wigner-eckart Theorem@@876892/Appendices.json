This problem [@problem_id:1658389] challenges you to use the theorem's 'triangle inequality' to explain a key experimental fact in nuclear physics: why any nucleus with spin $I=1/2$ has a zero electric quadrupole moment. This demonstrates how abstract angular momentum rules have profound and measurable physical consequences.", "problem": "In nuclear physics, the electric quadrupole moment provides information about the shape of a nucleus. It is a measure of the deviation of the nuclear charge distribution from spherical symmetry. The electric quadrupole moment operator, $Q$, is a rank-2 tensor. For calculations involving angular momentum, it is convenient to express this operator in terms of its irreducible spherical tensor components, denoted as $T_q^{(k)}$, where $k$ is the rank and $q$ is the component index. The electric quadrupole moment corresponds to the spherical tensor components with rank $k=2$.\n\nConsider a nucleus with a total angular momentum quantum number $I=1/2$. The state of the nucleus is described by the ket $|I, m_I\\rangle$, where $m_I$ is the magnetic quantum number. The observable value of the electric quadrupole moment is related to the expectation value of the rank-2 tensor operator, $\\langle I, m_I | T_q^{(2)} | I, m_I \\rangle$.\n\nThe Wigner-Eckart theorem provides a crucial result for calculating matrix elements of tensor operators in states of definite angular momentum. It states that such a matrix element can be factored into two parts: a geometrical part, which is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that depends only on the angular momentum quantum numbers, and a physical part, the reduced matrix element, which is independent of the magnetic quantum numbers. The theorem is given by:\n$$ \\langle I', m_I' | T_q^{(k)} | I, m_I \\rangle = \\langle I, m_I; k, q | I', m_I' \\rangle \\langle I' \\| T^{(k)} \\| I \\rangle $$\nwhere $\\langle I, m_I; k, q | I', m_I' \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and $\\langle I' \\| T^{(k)} \\| I \\rangle$ is the reduced matrix element.\n\nIt is an established experimental and theoretical fact that any nucleus in a state with $I=1/2$ has a zero electric quadrupole moment. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, select the fundamental reason for this observation.\n\nA. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle I, m_I; 2, q | I, m_I \\rangle$ is non-zero only if the angular momentum quantum numbers $I$, $2$, and $I$ can form a triangle (the \"triangle inequality\"). For $I=1/2$, this condition is violated.\n\nB. For an expectation value, the magnetic quantum numbers of the initial and final states must be equal, which implies $q=0$. A rank-2 tensor operator, by definition, does not have a $q=0$ component.\n\nC. The reduced matrix element $\\langle I \\| T^{(2)} \\| I \\rangle$ is always zero for systems with half-integer total angular momentum due to fundamental symmetry principles related to time reversal.\n\nD. The operator $T_q^{(2)}$ is a non-scalar operator ($k \\neq 0$). The expectation value of any non-scalar operator in any eigenstate of angular momentum must be zero.\n\nE. Parity conservation requires the operator $T_q^{(2)}$ and the state $|I, m_I\\rangle$ to have specific parity properties, a condition which is not met for a rank-2 operator acting on a spin-1/2 state.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fundamental reason, based on the Wigner-Eckart theorem, why the electric quadrupole moment of a nucleus with total angular momentum $I=1/2$ is zero. The electric quadrupole moment is described by a rank-2 spherical tensor operator, $T_q^{(2)}$. We need to evaluate the expectation value $\\langle I, m_I | T_q^{(2)} | I, m_I \\rangle$ for the case where $I=1/2$.\n\nThe Wigner-Eckart theorem states:\n$$ \\langle I', m_I' | T_q^{(k)} | I, m_I \\rangle = \\langle I, m_I; k, q | I', m_I' \\rangle \\langle I' \\| T^{(k)} \\| I \\rangle $$\n\nFor our specific problem, we are calculating an expectation value, so the initial and final states are the same. This means:\n- Initial state angular momentum quantum number: $I = 1/2$\n- Final state angular momentum quantum number: $I' = 1/2$\n- Initial state magnetic quantum number: $m_I$\n- Final state magnetic quantum number: $m_I' = m_I$\n\nThe operator is the electric quadrupole moment operator, which is a rank-2 tensor, so:\n- Rank of the tensor operator: $k=2$\n- Component of the tensor operator: $q$\n\nSubstituting these into the Wigner-Eckart theorem, we get:\n$$ \\langle I=1/2, m_I | T_q^{(2)} | I=1/2, m_I \\rangle = \\langle 1/2, m_I; 2, q | 1/2, m_I \\rangle \\langle 1/2 \\| T^{(2)} \\| 1/2 \\rangle $$\n\nThe matrix element is a product of two terms: the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and the reduced matrix element. If either of these terms is zero, the entire matrix element will be zero. Let's analyze the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1/2, m_I; 2, q | 1/2, m_I \\rangle$.\n\nA Clebsch-Gordan coefficient of the form $\\langle j_1, m_1; j_2, m_2 | j, m \\rangle$ is non-zero only if two conditions (selection rules) are met:\n1. $m_1 + m_2 = m$\n2. The \"triangle inequality\": $|j_1 - j_2| \\le j \\le j_1 + j_2$\n\nLet's apply these rules to our coefficient $\\langle 1/2, m_I; 2, q | 1/2, m_I \\rangle$.\nHere, $j_1=1/2$, $m_1=m_I$, $j_2=2$, $m_2=q$, $j=1/2$, and $m=m_I$.\n\nApplying the first rule:\n$m_I + q = m_I \\implies q=0$.\nThis means that for the expectation value to be non-zero, we only need to consider the $q=0$ component of the tensor operator, $T_0^{(2)}$. The conclusion that $q$ must be zero makes option B incorrect, which claims that a rank-2 tensor does not have a $q=0$ component (it does, its components run from $q=-2$ to $q=+2$).\n\nApplying the second rule (the triangle inequality) with $j_1=1/2$, $j_2=2$, and $j=1/2$:\nWe must satisfy $|1/2 - 2| \\le 1/2 \\le 1/2 + 2$.\nLet's evaluate the bounds:\n$|1/2 - 2| = |-3/2| = 3/2$\n$1/2 + 2 = 5/2$\n\nSo the inequality becomes:\n$3/2 \\le 1/2 \\le 5/2$\n\nThe right part of the inequality, $1/2 \\le 5/2$, is true. However, the left part, $3/2 \\le 1/2$, is false. Since the triangle inequality is not satisfied, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient must be zero for any value of $m_I$.\n$$ \\langle 1/2, m_I; 2, q | 1/2, m_I \\rangle = 0 $$\n\nBecause the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, the entire matrix element must also be zero, regardless of the value of the reduced matrix element:\n$$ \\langle 1/2, m_I | T_q^{(2)} | 1/2, m_I \\rangle = 0 \\times \\langle 1/2 \\| T^{(2)} \\| 1/2 \\rangle = 0 $$\nThis provides a rigorous explanation for why the electric quadrupole moment of a spin-1/2 nucleus is zero. The reason is a fundamental consequence of the rules of angular momentum addition, as captured by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThis matches option A. Let's briefly analyze why the other options are incorrect.\n- B: A rank-2 tensor operator has components $q = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2$. The $q=0$ component does exist.\n- C: This makes a claim about the reduced matrix element. While it might be zero in some cases, the Wigner-Eckart theorem provides a more fundamental, purely geometric reason (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient being zero) that holds irrespective of the detailed physics contained in the reduced matrix element. The reason in A is sufficient and more general.\n- D: This is incorrect. For example, the expectation value of the $z$-component of the angular momentum operator, $J_z$ (a non-scalar operator), is $\\langle I, m_I | J_z | I, m_I \\rangle = \\hbar m_I$, which is generally non-zero.\n- E: Parity is a valid consideration for matrix elements, but the angular momentum selection rule from the Wigner-Eckart theorem is more direct and sufficient to prove the result. The electric quadrupole operator has even parity, and assuming the nuclear state has definite parity, this would not necessarily cause the matrix element to vanish. The angular momentum constraint is the decisive factor.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is the failure to satisfy the triangle inequality for the angular momenta involved.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1658389"}, {"introduction": "Beyond determining if a matrix element is zero, the Wigner-Eckart theorem provides a powerful way to relate the values of different non-zero matrix elements.
