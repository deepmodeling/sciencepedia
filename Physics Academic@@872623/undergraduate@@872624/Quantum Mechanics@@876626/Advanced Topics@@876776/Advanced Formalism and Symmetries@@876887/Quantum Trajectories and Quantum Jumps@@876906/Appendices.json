To model this mathematically, we need a specific tool—the jump operator, often denoted as $\\hat{L}$. This first exercise focuses on identifying the correct jump operator for the fundamental process of a two-level atom decaying from its excited state to its ground state, which is the building block for describing open quantum systems [@problem_id:2113503].", "problem": "Consider a simple model of a two-level atom. The atom has a ground state, denoted by the ket $|g\\rangle$, and an excited state, denoted by the ket $|e\\rangle$. These two states form a complete orthonormal basis for the atom's Hilbert space, such that $\\langle g|g \\rangle = \\langle e|e \\rangle = 1$ and $\\langle g|e \\rangle = 0$.\n\nSpontaneous emission is a quantum process where the atom transitions from its excited state $|e\\rangle$ to its ground state $|g\\rangle$. In the theory of open quantum systems, this process can be modeled as a discrete \"quantum jump.\" The effect of such a jump on the state of the atom is described by a specific quantum jump operator, $\\hat{L}$. If the atom is in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ before the jump, the unnormalized state immediately after the jump is given by $\\hat{L}|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nWhich of the following operators correctly represents the quantum jump operator $\\hat{L}$ for the process of spontaneous emission in this two-level atom?\n\nA. $\\hat{L} = |e\\rangle\\langle g|$\n\nB. $\\hat{L} = |g\\rangle\\langle e|$\n\nC. $\\hat{L} = |e\\rangle\\langle e|$\n\nD. $\\hat{L} = |g\\rangle\\langle g|$\n\nE. $\\hat{L} = |g\\rangle\\langle g| + |e\\rangle\\langle e|$", "solution": "We consider a two-level atom with orthonormal basis $\\{|g\\rangle,|e\\rangle\\}$ satisfying $\\langle g|g\\rangle=\\langle e|e\\rangle=1$ and $\\langle g|e\\rangle=0$. Spontaneous emission is a transition from the excited state $|e\\rangle$ to the ground state $|g\\rangle$.
