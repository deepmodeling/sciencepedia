This exercise allows you to explore the direct consequences of this principle in a practical scenario. By considering the hypothetical discovery of a particle with a fractional charge, you will determine how this new information would refine our prediction for the fundamental unit of magnetic charge, illustrating the powerful predictive nature of Dirac's argument [@problem_id:2101826].", "problem": "In the realm of theoretical particle physics, the existence of magnetic monopoles remains an open question. If such a particle exists, its properties would be deeply connected to the fundamental structure of electric charge. A key prediction is that the existence of a single magnetic monopole in the universe would require all electric charges to be quantized.\n\nImagine a future experiment in particle physics discovers a new, stable, isolated elementary particle with a measured electric charge of $q_p = \\frac{e}{3}$, where $e$ is the magnitude of the electron's charge. Assuming that magnetic monopoles exist, this discovery would refine the theoretical prediction for the minimum possible magnitude of the magnetic charge.\n\nWhat is the minimum non-zero magnitude for a magnetic charge, $g_{min}$, that is consistent with the existence of both the electron (charge $e$) and this new particle (charge $\\frac{e}{3}$)?\n\nExpress your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the elementary charge $e$ and Planck's constant $h$.", "solution": "The Dirac quantization condition, as derived in the main text, requires that for any electric charge $q_e$ and a magnetic monopole with magnetic flux $g$, their product must be an integer multiple of Planck's constant:\n$$q_e g = n h$$\nwhere $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This condition must hold simultaneously for all known elementary charges. For the electron (charge $e$) and the newly discovered particle (charge $e/3$), we have:\n1. $e \\cdot g = n_e h$\n2. $(e/3) \\cdot g = n_{e/3} h$\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express the magnetic flux as $g = 3n_{e/3} h / e$. Substituting this into the first equation yields $e (3n_{e/3} h / e) = n_e h$, which simplifies to $n_e = 3n_{e/3}$.\n\nSince both $n_e$ and $n_{e/3}$ must be integers, the smallest positive non-zero value for $g$ corresponds to the smallest positive integer choice for $n_{e/3}$, which is $n_{e/3} = 1$. This implies $n_e = 3$.\n\nSubstituting $n_{e/3}=1$ back into the expression for $g$ gives the minimum possible magnetic flux:\n$$g_{min} = \\frac{3(1)h}{e} = \\frac{3h}{e}$$\nThis is the smallest magnitude for the magnetic flux $g$ consistent with the existence of both charges $e$ and $e/3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3h}{e}}$$", "id": "2101826"}, {"introduction": "Abstract concepts like magnetic monopoles and Dirac strings become much clearer when we can connect them to tangible physical systems. This problem guides you to build intuition by modeling a magnetic monopole using a familiar object: a semi-infinite solenoid. By treating the open end of the solenoid, from which magnetic flux lines emerge, as an effective magnetic charge, you can directly calculate this charge in terms of the solenoid's magnetic flux. This practice brilliantly bridges the gap between a purely theoretical construct and a concrete electromagnetic model [@problem_id:34438].", "problem": "In the theory of magnetic monopoles, a Dirac string is a hypothetical one-dimensional line singularity that sources magnetic flux and terminates on a magnetic charge.
