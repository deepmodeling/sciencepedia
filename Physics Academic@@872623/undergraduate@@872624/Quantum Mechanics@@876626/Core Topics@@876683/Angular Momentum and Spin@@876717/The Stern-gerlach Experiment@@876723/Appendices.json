This practice addresses a crucial experimental question: why was it necessary to use neutral atoms like silver, rather than charged particles like free protons? By quantitatively comparing the magnitude of the spin-dependent Stern-Gerlach force to the overwhelming Lorentz force that also acts on a moving charged particle, you will discover the clever experimental design required to isolate and measure the subtle quantum effect of spin [@problem_id:2141534].", "problem": "A classic Stern-Gerlach apparatus is designed to measure the intrinsic spin of particles by observing their deflection in an inhomogeneous magnetic field. While famously successful for neutral atoms like silver, the experiment is notoriously difficult to perform on charged particles like free protons. This problem explores the primary reason for this difficulty.\n\nConsider a beam of non-relativistic protons traveling along the x-axis. The protons have a mean kinetic energy of $K_0 = 15.0 \\text{ keV}$ and a fractional energy spread of $\\frac{\\Delta K}{K_0} = 0.100\\%$, where $\\Delta K$ is the characteristic width of the kinetic energy distribution. The beam enters a region of length $L = 0.750 \\text{ m}$ containing a magnetic field. This field produces two distinct forces on the protons in the vertical (z) direction:\n\n1.  A spin-dependent Stern-Gerlach force, $F_{SG,z} = \\mu_z \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}$, where $\\mu_z$ is the z-component of the proton's magnetic moment and the magnetic field gradient is $\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z} = 1200 \\text{ T/m}$.\n2.  A spin-independent Lorentz force, $F_{L,z} = e v_x B_y$, arising from a transverse magnetic field component $B_y = 0.800 \\text{ T}$. Here, $v_x$ is the speed of a given proton and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThe Stern-Gerlach force causes a separation between protons with \"spin-up\" and \"spin-down\" orientations. However, the energy spread in the beam causes a spread (or \"blurring\") in the deflection caused by the Lorentz force, which can obscure this separation.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the blurring in the final z-position (the spread in deflection due to the beam's energy uncertainty) to the separation distance between the spin-up and spin-down components. Treat this ratio as a measure of the experiment's impracticality.\n\nUse the following constants:\n- Mass of a proton, $m_p = 1.672 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}$\n- Elementary charge, $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}$\n- Magnitude of the proton's intrinsic magnetic moment, $\\mu_p = 1.411 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ J/T}$\n- $1 \\text{ eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "We model the motion through the magnetized region of length $L$ and evaluate the deflections at the exit of this region.
