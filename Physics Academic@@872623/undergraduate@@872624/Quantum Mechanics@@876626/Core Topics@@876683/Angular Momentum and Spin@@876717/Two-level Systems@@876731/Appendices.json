An operator $\\hat{M}$ is Hermitian if it is equal to its own Hermitian conjugate (also known as the adjoint), denoted $\\hat{M}^\\dagger$. In terms of matrix representations, this means the matrix $M$ representing the operator must be equal to its conjugate transpose, $M^\\dagger$. The conjugate transpose is found by taking the transpose of the matrix and then taking the complex conjugate of each element.\n\nLet's write down the matrix $M$ based on the provided elements $M_{ij}$:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} M_{11}  M_{12} \\\\ M_{21}  M_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the Hermitian conjugate, $M^\\dagger$.\n\nStep 1: Find the transpose of $M$, denoted $M^T$. The transpose is obtained by swapping the rows and columns.\n$$\nM^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nStep 2: Find the complex conjugate of each element of $M^T$. The resulting matrix is the Hermitian conjugate, $M^\\dagger$. Since all elements of $M^T$ are real numbers, the complex conjugate of each element is just the element itself.\n$$\nM^\\dagger = (M^T)^* = \\begin{pmatrix} 1^*  (-1)^* \\\\ 1^*  1^* \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nStep 3: Compare the original matrix $M$ with its Hermitian conjugate $M^\\dagger$.\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $M \\neq M^\\dagger$ (specifically, the off-diagonal elements differ), the matrix $M$ is not Hermitian. Therefore, the operator $\\hat{M}$ cannot represent a physical observable. This points to option C as the correct answer.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options to confirm they are incorrect.\n\nOption A) \"Yes, because the operator has real eigenvalues.\" This statement is incorrect on two fronts. First, a key theorem of quantum mechanics states that Hermitian operators *always* have real eigenvalues. The converse isn't the defining property. Let's check the eigenvalues of $M$ by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(M - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\lambda  1 \\\\ -1  1-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (1-\\lambda)(1-\\lambda) - (1)(-1) = (1-\\lambda)^2 + 1 = 0\n$$\n$$\n(1-\\lambda)^2 = -1 \\implies 1-\\lambda = \\pm i \\implies \\lambda = 1 \\mp i\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are complex, not real. So the premise of option A is false. Since the operator is not Hermitian, we expect its eigenvalues to be not necessarily real.\n\nOption B) \"Yes, because the matrix is invertible.\" The invertibility of an operator is not a requirement for it to be an observable. A matrix is invertible if its determinant is non-zero.\n$$\n\\det(M) = (1)(1) - (1)(-1) = 2\n$$\nThe matrix is indeed invertible, but this property is irrelevant to whether it represents an observable. For instance, projection operators are valid observables (e.g., measuring if a particle is in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$) but are not invertible as they have at least one eigenvalue of zero.\n\nOption D) \"No, because the trace of the matrix is not equal to 1.\" The trace of an operator is not required to be 1 for it to be an observable. The trace of $M$ is $\\text{Tr}(M) = 1 + 1 = 2$. While the trace has physical significance in some contexts (e.g., the condition $\\text{Tr}(\\hat{\\rho})=1$ for a density operator $\\hat{\\rho}$), it is not a general condition for an operator to be an observable. The Hamiltonian, for example, is an observable whose trace can be any real number.\n\nThus, the only correct reason is that the operator is not Hermitian.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2146894"}, {"introduction": "The description of a quantum state is not absolute; it depends on the measurement basis you choose.
