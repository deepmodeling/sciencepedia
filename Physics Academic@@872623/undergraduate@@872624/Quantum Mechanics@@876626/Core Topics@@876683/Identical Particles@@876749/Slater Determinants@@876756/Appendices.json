For example, our set of occupied orbitals might be $\\{\\chi_A, \\chi_A, \\chi_B\\}$. In this case, the Slater determinant would have two identical rows, which immediately implies that its value is zero.\n\nIn either the general case (linearly dependent rows) or the simple case (identical rows), the determinant vanishes.
