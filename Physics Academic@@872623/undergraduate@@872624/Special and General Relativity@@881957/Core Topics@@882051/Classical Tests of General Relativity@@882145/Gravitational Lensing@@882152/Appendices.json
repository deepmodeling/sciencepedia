For a source at a given position $y>0$, this equation yields two solutions for $x$, corresponding to two observed images.\n\nThe surface brightness of the source is conserved, so the magnification of an image is the ratio of its area to the source's area. For this lensing system, the magnification $\\mu$ of an image at a dimensionless position $x$ is given by:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{x^4}{x^4-1} $$\nThe total magnification, $\\mu_{tot}$, is the sum of the absolute values of the magnifications of the two individual images.\n\nAn astronomer is analyzing a microlensing event and finds the source to be located at a dimensionless position of $y = 0.5$. What is the total magnification, $\\mu_{tot}$, of the source? Provide your answer as a numerical value rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total magnification $\\mu_{tot}$ for a dimensionless source position $y=0.5$. The total magnification is the sum of the absolute magnifications of the two images. First, we will derive a general expression for $\\mu_{tot}$ in terms of $y$, and then substitute the given value.\n\nThe dimensionless lens equation is $y = x - \\frac{1}{x}$. We can rearrange this into a quadratic equation for the image position $x$:\n$$ x^2 - yx - 1 = 0 $$\nThe two solutions for $x$, which we denote $x_+$ and $x_-$, are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$ x_{\\pm} = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{y^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = \\frac{y \\pm \\sqrt{y^2+4}}{2} $$\nFor any positive $y$, $\\sqrt{y^2+4} > \\sqrt{y^2} = y$. This means $x_+ = \\frac{y + \\sqrt{y^2+4}}{2}$ is positive, and $x_- = \\frac{y - \\sqrt{y^2+4}}{2}$ is negative. The two images appear on opposite sides of the lens.\nFrom Vieta's formulas, we know the sum and product of the roots:\n$$ x_+ + x_- = y $$\n$$ x_+ x_- = -1 $$\n\nThe magnification of an image at position $x$ is $\\mu = \\frac{x^4}{x^4-1}$. The total magnification is $\\mu_{tot} = |\\mu(x_+)| + |\\mu(x_-)|$.\n\nLet's analyze the sign of the magnification for each image. For $y>0$, we can show that $x_+ > 1$. This implies $x_+^4 > 1$, so $x_+^4 - 1 > 0$, and the magnification $\\mu(x_+) = \\frac{x_+^4}{x_+^4-1}$ is positive.\nFor the second image, we can show that $|x_-| < 1$. This means $x_-^4 < 1$, so $x_-^4 - 1 < 0$. The magnification $\\mu(x_-) = \\frac{x_-^4}{x_-^4-1}$ is negative.\nTherefore, the total magnification is:\n$$ \\mu_{tot} = \\mu(x_+) + |\\mu(x_-)| = \\frac{x_+^4}{x_+^4-1} - \\frac{x_-^4}{x_-^4-1} = \\frac{x_+^4}{x_+^4-1} + \\frac{x_-^4}{1-x_-^4} $$\nCombining the terms over a common denominator:\n$$ \\mu_{tot} = \\frac{x_+^4(1-x_-^4) + x_-^4(x_+^4-1)}{(x_+^4-1)(1-x_-^4)} = \\frac{x_+^4 - (x_+x_-)^4 + (x_+x_-)^4 - x_-^4}{x_+^4 - 1 - (x_+x_-)^4 + x_-^4} = \\frac{x_+^4 - x_-^4}{x_+^4 + x_-^4 - (x_+x_-)^4 - 1} $$\nUsing the product of roots $x_+x_- = -1$, we have $(x_+x_-)^4 = (-1)^4 = 1$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\mu_{tot} = \\frac{x_+^4 - x_-^4}{x_+^4 + x_-^4 - 2} $$\nNow we express the numerator and denominator in terms of $y$.\n$$ x_+^2 + x_-^2 = (x_+ + x_-)^2 - 2x_+x_- = y^2 - 2(-1) = y^2+2 $$\n$$ x_+^4 + x_-^4 = (x_+^2 + x_-^2)^2 - 2(x_+x_-)^2 = (y^2+2)^2 - 2(-1)^2 = (y^2+2)^2 - 2 = y^4 + 4y^2 + 4 - 2 = y^4 + 4y^2 + 2 $$\nFor the numerator, we also need $x_+ - x_- = \\sqrt{y^2+4}$.\n$$ x_+^4 - x_-^4 = (x_+^2 - x_-^2)(x_+^2 + x_-^2) = (x_+ - x_-)(x_+ + x_-)(x_+^2 + x_-^2) $$\n$$ x_+^4 - x_-^4 = (\\sqrt{y^2+4})(y)(y^2+2) = y(y^2+2)\\sqrt{y^2+4} $$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $\\mu_{tot}$:\n$$ \\mu_{tot} = \\frac{y(y^2+2)\\sqrt{y^2+4}}{(y^4 + 4y^2 + 2) - 2} = \\frac{y(y^2+2)\\sqrt{y^2+4}}{y^4 + 4y^2} = \\frac{y(y^2+2)\\sqrt{y^2+4}}{y^2(y^2+4)} $$\n$$ \\mu_{tot} = \\frac{(y^2+2)\\sqrt{y^2+4}}{y(y^2+4)} $$\nSince $y^2+4 = (\\sqrt{y^2+4})^2$, we can simplify further:\n$$ \\mu_{tot} = \\frac{y^2+2}{y\\sqrt{y^2+4}} $$\nThis is the general expression for the total magnification as a function of the source position $y$.\n\nNow we can substitute the given value $y = 0.5$:\n$$ \\mu_{tot} = \\frac{(0.5)^2+2}{0.5\\sqrt{(0.5)^2+4}} = \\frac{0.25+2}{0.5\\sqrt{0.25+4}} = \\frac{2.25}{0.5\\sqrt{4.25}} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\mu_{tot} = \\frac{2.25}{0.5 \\times 2.0615528...} = \\frac{2.25}{1.0307764...} \\approx 2.18283... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get 2.18.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.18}$$", "id": "1830813"}, {"introduction": "Real astrophysical lenses are rarely isolated point masses; they are often embedded in larger structures like galaxies or dark matter halos.
