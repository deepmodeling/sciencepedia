## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the principles and mechanisms for defining the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass and momentum, we now turn to their application. The ADM formalism provides the definitive statement of total energy and momentum for an [isolated system](@entry_id:142067) in general relativity. Its true power, however, is revealed when we explore how these quantities manifest in diverse physical scenarios, connecting the abstract mathematics of [spacetime geometry](@entry_id:139497) to observable phenomena and foundational concepts across physics. This chapter will demonstrate the utility of ADM mass and momentum in contexts ranging from [gravitational wave astronomy](@entry_id:144334) and [black hole thermodynamics](@entry_id:136383) to observational cosmology and the theoretical underpinnings of gravity itself.

### The Physical Interpretation of ADM Mass

The ADM mass, $M_{ADM}$, is not merely a mathematical abstraction but the physical total mass-energy of an [isolated system](@entry_id:142067) as measured by a distant observer. It is the [gravitational mass](@entry_id:260748) that governs the system's influence on spacetime at large scales.

#### ADM Mass as Total Mass-Energy

For many well-known exact solutions in general relativity, the ADM mass corresponds directly to the mass parameter, $M$, appearing in the metric. This is true for the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, and Kerr-Newman families of black holes. In the case of a charged Reissner-Nordström black hole, the ADM mass is found to be exactly equal to the mass parameter $M$, independent of the charge parameter $Q$. This is a profound result, as it implies that the energy stored in the black hole's external electric field is already accounted for within the total mass-energy $M$ [@problem_id:1813553]. Similarly, for a rotating and charged Kerr-Newman black hole, the ADM mass is simply its mass parameter $M$, demonstrating that contributions from both [rotational energy](@entry_id:160662) and [electric field energy](@entry_id:270775) are intrinsically included in this single value [@problem_id:1813546].

A crucial aspect of the ADM mass is its inclusion of all forms of energy, including potential energy. In the Newtonian limit, we can approximate the ADM mass of a system of two widely separated, momentarily static masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$. The total energy of such a system is the sum of their rest mass energies and their negative gravitational potential energy. Dividing by $c^2$ gives the total ADM mass:
$$ M_{ADM} = m_1 + m_2 - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r c^2} $$
This simple expression beautifully illustrates that [gravitational binding energy](@entry_id:159053) contributes negatively to the total mass of the system. A gravitationally bound system has less total mass than the sum of its constituent parts when infinitely separated [@problem_id:1813609].

This concept finds a more sophisticated expression in the context of initial data for numerical relativity. The Brill-Lindquist initial data describes two black holes momentarily at rest. A calculation of the ADM mass for this highly non-linear configuration yields a surprisingly simple result: $M_{ADM} = m_1 + m_2$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the mass parameters of the individual black holes. This result appears to contradict the Newtonian intuition of a negative binding energy. The resolution lies in understanding that the ADM mass is a monopole quantity, describing the $1/r$ fall-off of the gravitational field. The interaction energy in the fully relativistic Brill-Lindquist solution is encoded in the higher-order [multipole moments](@entry_id:191120) of the spatial geometry, which fall off faster than $1/r$ and thus do not contribute to the total ADM mass. This distinction is critical for setting up and interpreting numerical simulations of [binary black hole mergers](@entry_id:746798) [@problem_id:1813587].

### ADM Momentum and the Center-of-Momentum Frame

Just as ADM mass generalizes the Newtonian concept of total mass, the ADM momentum three-vector, $\vec{P}_{ADM}$, generalizes the concept of [total linear momentum](@entry_id:173071). Together, they form an ADM [energy-momentum four-vector](@entry_id:156403), $(M_{ADM}, \vec{P}_{ADM})$, that has properties analogous to the [energy-momentum four-vector](@entry_id:156403) in special relativity.

Under a Lorentz boost applied to the asymptotic coordinate system, the ADM four-momentum transforms as a standard [four-vector](@entry_id:160261). This allows us to define a [center-of-momentum frame](@entry_id:199996) for any isolated system. If a system in one frame is measured to have ADM mass $M$ and ADM momentum $\vec{P}$, one can find a frame moving at velocity $\vec{v}$ where the measured ADM momentum is zero. In the [non-relativistic limit](@entry_id:183353), this velocity is simply $\vec{v} = \vec{P}/M$, precisely analogous to the classical definition of the velocity of the center of mass. This confirms that the ADM quantities provide a consistent relativistic generalization of [conserved quantities](@entry_id:148503) from classical mechanics [@problem_id:1813550].

In practice, the ADM momentum is often zero by construction. Standard stationary solutions like the Kerr-Newman metric are typically presented in their rest frame, where $\vec{P}_{ADM}=0$ by definition [@problem_id:1813546]. However, care must be taken, as a non-zero ADM momentum can sometimes be a mere coordinate artifact. An ill-chosen coordinate system at spatial infinity can appear to be moving, inducing a non-zero ADM momentum even for a physically static or stationary object. The true physical momentum of a system is encoded in specific asymptotic behaviors of the metric that must be carefully distinguished from such coordinate effects [@problem_id:1813575].

### ADM Quantities in Dynamic Spacetimes: Gravitational Waves

Perhaps the most compelling modern application of ADM mass and momentum is in the field of [gravitational wave astronomy](@entry_id:144334). While the ADM quantities are formally defined at spatial infinity and are conserved for any [isolated system](@entry_id:142067), they provide a crucial benchmark for tracking energy and momentum changes in dynamic systems.

#### Mass-Energy Loss through Gravitational Radiation

An [isolated system](@entry_id:142067) that emits gravitational waves loses energy. This energy loss is reflected in a decrease of the system's total ADM mass. The relationship is precise: the rate of decrease of the ADM mass is equal to the total power radiated in gravitational waves, divided by $c^2$. This is often known as the Bondi mass-loss formula, which connects the ADM mass defined on spacelike slices with the energy flux measured at [null infinity](@entry_id:159987). For any astrophysical event, such as an asymmetric core-collapse [supernova](@entry_id:159451), the final ADM mass of the remnant object, $M_f$, is related to the initial mass, $M_i$, by the total radiated energy, $E_{GW}$:
$$ M_f = M_i - \frac{E_{GW}}{c^2} $$
This principle of [energy conservation](@entry_id:146975) is fundamental to interpreting the energetics of violent cosmic events observed through gravitational waves [@problem_id:1813596].

#### Momentum Conservation and Gravitational Wave "Rockets"

Just as energy can be radiated, so too can [linear momentum](@entry_id:174467). If a merging binary system is asymmetric (e.g., due to unequal masses or misaligned spins), the gravitational waves will be emitted anisotropically, carrying a net linear momentum. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total ADM momentum of the system must be conserved. If the initial system has zero ADM momentum, the final remnant black hole must recoil with a momentum exactly equal and opposite to that carried away by the gravitational waves. This phenomenon, known as a "[gravitational wave kick](@entry_id:187439)" or "rocket effect," can impart velocities of hundreds or even thousands of kilometers per second to the final black hole. This effect has profound astrophysical implications, as it can eject newly formed black holes from their host galaxies [@problem_id:1813552].

### Interdisciplinary Connections and Broader Context

The concepts of ADM mass and momentum provide crucial links between general relativity and other areas of science.

#### Observational Astronomy: Gravitational Lensing

One of the most direct ways to measure the mass of a celestial object is through its gravitational influence. The deflection of light from a distant source as it passes a massive object—[gravitational lensing](@entry_id:159000)—is a key observational tool. In general relativity, the angle of deflection for light passing at a large [impact parameter](@entry_id:165532) is directly proportional to the total ADM mass of the lensing object. This provides a powerful connection: an astronomical observation of light deflection can be used to determine the ADM mass, the total mass-energy content of the lensing object as defined by general relativity [@problem_id:1813598].

#### Black Hole Thermodynamics and Quantum Effects

The ADM mass is central to the laws of [black hole mechanics](@entry_id:264759), which form a deep analogy with the laws of thermodynamics. The Christodoulou-Ruffini mass formula relates a black hole's total ADM mass $M$ to its [irreducible mass](@entry_id:160861) $M_{ir}$, angular momentum $J$, and charge $Q$. The [irreducible mass](@entry_id:160861) is proportional to the square root of the event horizon's surface area, which, according to the second law of [black hole mechanics](@entry_id:264759), can never decrease in any classical process. The formula shows that the total ADM mass consists of this inextractable [irreducible mass](@entry_id:160861) plus extractable rotational and electrostatic energy. This framework is essential for understanding processes like the Penrose process, where energy is extracted from a [rotating black hole](@entry_id:261667) [@problem_id:1813559].

The connection extends to the quantum realm through Hawking radiation. A black hole is not truly black but radiates particles due to quantum effects near its horizon. This radiation carries away energy, causing the black hole to lose mass and eventually evaporate. This mass loss is precisely a decrease in the spacetime's ADM mass. The rate of change of the ADM mass is directly related to the power of the Hawking radiation as measured by a distant observer, providing a bridge between general relativity, thermodynamics, and [quantum field theory in curved spacetime](@entry_id:158321) [@problem_id:1813593].

#### Alternative Theories of Gravity and Speculative Physics

The concept of ADM mass can be formulated in many [metric theories of gravity](@entry_id:272070), not just general relativity. However, the relationship between the ADM mass and the underlying "matter" sources can differ. In [scalar-tensor theories](@entry_id:200590) like Brans-Dicke theory, the gravitationally measured ADM mass depends not only on the matter content but also on the value of the scalar field and the theory's coupling parameters. Comparing the ADM mass inferred from gravitational observations with mass estimates from other means can therefore provide a powerful [test of general relativity](@entry_id:269089) against such alternative theories [@problem_id:1813607].

The ADM framework is also robust enough to handle spacetimes with exotic topologies, such as hypothetical [traversable wormholes](@entry_id:192676). For a wormhole connecting two distinct, asymptotically flat regions, one can define an ADM mass for each "universe." The masses measured at the two ends need not be the same; their difference is determined by the total energy of the matter and fields threading the wormhole. Such [thought experiments](@entry_id:264574) clarify that ADM mass is a property of an entire asymptotically flat region, sourced by all the energy it contains [@problem_id:1813557].

### The Theoretical Foundation: The Positive Mass Theorem

Underpinning all these applications is a cornerstone result in mathematical relativity: the Positive Mass Theorem. This theorem provides the ultimate justification for interpreting $M_{ADM}$ as a physical mass. It states that for any isolated system that satisfies the dominant energy condition—a physically reasonable requirement that energy density is non-negative and does not flow faster than light—the total ADM mass must be non-negative ($M_{ADM} \ge 0$). Furthermore, the ADM mass is zero if and only if the spacetime is flat Minkowski space. The full theorem, proven using advanced techniques such as the Witten spinorial method, shows that the ADM [four-momentum](@entry_id:161888) $(M, \vec{P})$ must be a future-pointing, non-spacelike [four-vector](@entry_id:160261), which implies $M_{ADM} \ge |\vec{P}_{ADM}|/c$. This guarantees that the total energy is positive and provides a criterion for the stability of spacetime itself, securing the physical foundation upon which all the applications discussed in this chapter are built [@problem_id:3037358].
