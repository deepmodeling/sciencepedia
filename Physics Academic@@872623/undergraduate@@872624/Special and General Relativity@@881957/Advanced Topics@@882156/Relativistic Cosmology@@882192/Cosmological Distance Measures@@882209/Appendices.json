This first exercise introduces two of the most important cosmological distances: the luminosity distance $d_L$, inferred from an object's apparent brightness, and the angular diameter distance $d_A$, inferred from its apparent size. You will use the fundamental Etherington's distance-duality relation, $d_L = d_A (1+z)^2$, to see just how dramatically these two measures can diverge at high redshift $z$. This practice solidifies the core principle that redshift systematically affects our measurements of brightness and angular size in cosmology.", "problem": "An astronomical survey team is studying a distant quasar. By analyzing the spectral lines in the quasar's light, they determine its cosmological redshift to be $z = 1.5$. Further observations, using the properties of the quasar as a \"standard candle,\" allow the team to calculate its luminosity distance, $d_L$, as 6.0 Gigaparsecs (Gpc). For cosmological analyses, another important distance measure is the angular diameter distance, $d_A$, which relates an object's physical size to its apparent angular size in the sky. Assuming a standard cosmological model where photon number is conserved, determine the angular diameter distance $d_A$ to this quasar.\n\nExpress your answer in Gpc, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the angular diameter distance, $d_A$, given the luminosity distance, $d_L$, and the redshift, $z$. The relationship between these three quantities in a standard cosmological model is given by Etherington's distance-duality relation. This relation is a direct consequence of the reciprocity theorem in geometric optics and holds for any cosmological model based on a metric theory of gravity.\n\nThe formula is:\n$$d_L = d_A (1+z)^2$$\n\nWe need to solve for the angular diameter distance, $d_A$.
