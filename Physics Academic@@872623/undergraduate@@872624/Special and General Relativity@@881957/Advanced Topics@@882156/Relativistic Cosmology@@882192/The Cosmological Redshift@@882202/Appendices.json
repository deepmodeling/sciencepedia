For any light signal propagating between two comoving galaxies, the cosmological redshift is determined solely by the ratio of the scale factor at observation to that at emission:\n$$\n1+z=\\frac{a(t_{\\text{obs}})}{a(t_{\\text{em}})}.\n$$\nLet the Milky Way (MW) and Galaxy G be comoving. Consider the light we observe now from G. Denote our current cosmic time by $t_{0}$ and G’s emission time by $t_{e}$. Then\n$$\n1+z_{G}=\\frac{a(t_{0})}{a(t_{e})}.\n$$\nRadial null geodesics in FLRW satisfy, for the fixed comoving separation $r$ between the two galaxies,\n$$\nr=\\int_{t_{e}}^{t_{0}}\\frac{c\\,dt}{a(t)}.\n$$\nNow consider what an observer in Galaxy G measures for light from the Milky Way observed at G’s current time. Because cosmic time is global in FLRW, “now” for G is the same cosmic time $t_{0}$ as for us. Let $t_{e}'$ be the emission time on the Milky Way worldline for the photon that arrives to G at $t_{0}$. The same comoving separation implies\n$$\nr=\\int_{t_{e}'}^{t_{0}}\\frac{c\\,dt}{a(t)}.\n$$\nSince the right-hand sides are equal and $t_{0}$ and $r$ are the same in both integrals, it follows that $t_{e}'=t_{e}$.
