For modeling purposes, the nebula can be treated as a \"dust cloud\"—a uniform distribution of non-interacting particles. In the reference frame where the cloud is at rest, which we call frame $S$, the dust has a constant proper mass density $\\rho_0$.\n\nThe probe moves at a constant, relativistic velocity of magnitude $v$ with respect to frame $S$.

We want to find the energy density measured in $S'$. The energy density is the time-time component, $T^{0'0'}$, of the stress-energy tensor in the primed frame.\n\nWe adopt the Minkowski metric with signature $(-,+,+,+)$. The four-velocity $U^\\mu$ of any particle is normalized such that $U_\\mu U^\\mu = -c^2$.

This is a convention where $T^{00}$ in the rest frame gives the energy density $\\rho_0 c^2$.

From the perspective of the probe, the dust cloud is moving with velocity $-v$. Let's assume the probe moves along the positive x-axis of $S$. Then in frame $S'$, the dust cloud moves with velocity $-v$ along the x'-axis. The four-velocity of the dust in frame $S'$ is:\n$$u^{\\mu'}_{S'} = \\gamma(1, -v/c, 0, 0)$$\nwhere $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$.\n\nThe energy density in $S'$, which we denote $\\rho'_E$, is the $T^{0'0'}$ component of the tensor calculated in this frame:\n$$\\rho'_E = T^{0'0'} = \\rho_E (u^{0'})^2 = (\\rho_0 c^2) \\gamma^2$$\nSubstituting the full expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$\\rho'_E = \\frac{\\rho_0 c^2}{1 - v^2/c^2}$$\nThis result shows that the energy density measured by the moving observer is increased by a factor of $\\gamma^2$.
