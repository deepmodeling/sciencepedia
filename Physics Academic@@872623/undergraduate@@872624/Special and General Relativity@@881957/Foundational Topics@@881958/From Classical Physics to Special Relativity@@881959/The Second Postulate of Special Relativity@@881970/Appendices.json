The pion travels along a straight line in a vacuum with a constant speed of $v = 0.95c$ relative to the laboratory frame, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. After a very short time, the pion decays into two high-energy photons. In the pion's own rest frame, these two photons are emitted in opposite directions, both traveling along the pion's original line of motion.\n\nLet the \"forward photon\" be the one emitted in the direction of the pion's motion relative to the laboratory, and the \"backward photon\" be the one emitted in the opposite direction.\n\nDetermine the speed of the forward photon and the speed of the backward photon, as measured by an observer in the laboratory frame. Your answer should be a pair of values, for the forward and backward photons respectively, expressed in terms of $c$.", "solution": "Let the laboratory frame be $S$ and the pion rest frame be $S'$. In $S'$, the two photons are emitted collinearly with the motion of the pion: the forward photon has velocity $u'_{+} = +c$ and the backward photon has velocity $u'_{-} = -c$ along the line of motion.\n\nTo find their velocities in $S$, use the relativistic velocity addition formula for collinear motion:\n$$\nu = \\frac{u' + v}{1 + \\frac{u' v}{c^{2}}}.\n$$\n\nFor the forward photon,\n$$\nu_{+} = \\frac{c + v}{1 + \\frac{c v}{c^{2}}} = \\frac{c + v}{1 + \\frac{v}{c}} = c.\n$$\n\nFor the backward photon,\n$$\nu_{-} = \\frac{-c + v}{1 - \\frac{c v}{c^{2}}} = \\frac{v - c}{1 - \\frac{v}{c}} = -c.\n$$\n\nThus, in the laboratory frame, both photons have speed $c$, with the forward photon moving in the $+x$ direction and the backward photon in the $-x$ direction.
