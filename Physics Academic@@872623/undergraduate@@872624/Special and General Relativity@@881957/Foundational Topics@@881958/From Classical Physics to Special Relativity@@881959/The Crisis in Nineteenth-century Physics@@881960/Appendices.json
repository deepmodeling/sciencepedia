This model treated light analogously to sound waves traveling through air.\n\nConsider a thought experiment based on this aether model. A light source is at rest in the aether and emits a light wave that travels at a constant speed $c$ relative to the aether. An observer is moving at a constant speed $v$ relative to the aether, on a path directly toward the stationary light source.\n\nAssuming the validity of Galilean relativity (the principles of mechanics as understood by Newton), determine the speed of the light wave, $c'$, as measured by the moving observer. Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $c$ and $v$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we apply the Galilean transformation for velocities. This transformation relates the velocity of an object as measured in two different inertial frames of reference that are moving at a constant velocity with respect to each other.\n\nLet's define our frames of reference:\n1.  Frame $S$: This is the rest frame of the luminiferous aether. In this frame, the light source is stationary, and the light wave propagates with speed $c$.\n2.  Frame $S'$: This is the rest frame of the observer. This frame moves at a constant velocity relative to frame $S$.\n\nWe can set up a one-dimensional coordinate system for simplicity, as the motion is along a straight line. Let the direction of propagation of the light wave in frame $S$ be the positive $x$-direction. The velocity of the light wave in frame $S$ is therefore $\\vec{u} = c \\hat{x}$.\n\nThe observer is moving directly *toward* the light source. Since the light wave is moving away from the source in the positive $x$-direction, the observer must be moving in the negative $x$-direction. The velocity of the observer's frame ($S'$) relative to the aether frame ($S$) is $\\vec{V} = -v \\hat{x}$.\n\nThe Galilean velocity transformation law states that if an object has velocity $\\vec{u}$ in frame $S$, its velocity $\\vec{u}'$ in frame $S'$ is given by:\n$$\n\\vec{u}' = \\vec{u} - \\vec{V}\n$$\nHere, $\\vec{u}'$ represents the velocity of the light wave as measured by the observer in their own rest frame, $S'$.\n\nNow, we substitute the velocities into the transformation equation. In one dimension, this becomes:\n$$\nu'_x = u_x - V_x\n$$\nWe have $u_x = c$ (the speed of light in the aether) and $V_x = -v$ (the velocity of the observer's frame relative to the aether).\n\nPlugging in these values:\n$$\nu'_x = c - (-v)\n$$\n$$\nu'_x = c + v\n$$\nThe speed of the light wave as measured by the observer, $c'$, is the magnitude of this velocity. Since $c$ and $v$ are both defined as speeds, they are non-negative. Therefore, the speed measured by the observer is:\n$$\nc' = |u'_x| = |c + v| = c + v\n$$\nThus, according to the Galilean-aether model, an observer moving toward a light source would measure the speed of light to be the sum of the standard speed of light and their own speed through the aether. This prediction was famously contradicted by experimental results like the Michelson-Morley experiment, which found the speed of light to be constant for all inertial observers, a cornerstone of Einstein's special theory of relativity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{c+v}$$", "id": "1859444"}, {"introduction": "The persistent null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment was a profound puzzle, as it failed to detect Earth's motion through the aether. To reconcile theory with observation, FitzGerald and Lorentz proposed a radical, though *ad hoc*, solution: that objects physically contract along their direction of motion. This practice [@problem_id:1859421] challenges you to calculate the precise amount of this proposed length contraction required to explain the experiment's outcome, illustrating the lengths to which physicists went to \"save\" the aether theory.", "problem": "In the late 19th century, physicists grappled with the perplexing null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment, which failed to detect the motion of the Earth through the hypothesized luminiferous aether. The experiment used an interferometer with two perpendicular arms of equal length. According to the aether theory, a time difference was expected for light beams traveling along these two arms.\n\nTo reconcile theory with observation, George FitzGerald and Hendrik Lorentz independently proposed that any object moving through the aether would contract in its direction of motion. Consider a simplified model of the interferometer moving at a constant velocity $v$ through a stationary aether. The speed of light relative to this aether is a constant, $c$. The interferometer has two arms of equal length, $L$, oriented such that one is parallel to the direction of motion and the other is perpendicular.\n\nTo explain the null result, assume that the length of the arm parallel to the motion is physically contracted to a new length, $L'$. The length of the perpendicular arm remains $L$. Your task is to determine the theoretical fractional change in length, defined as $(L' - L) / L$, required for the round-trip travel times of light along both arms to be exactly equal. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the speeds $v$ and $c$.", "solution": "The goal is to find the fractional length contraction, $(L' - L) / L$, such that the round-trip time for light is the same for both arms of the interferometer. Let's denote the arm parallel to the motion as arm 1 and the perpendicular arm as arm 2.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the round-trip time, $t_2$, for the light beam in arm 2, which is perpendicular to the motion. The interferometer moves a distance $v t_{\\text{out}}$ sideways while the light travels from the beam splitter to the mirror. The light must travel along the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides $L$ and $v t_{\\text{out}}$. The distance traveled by light is $c t_{\\text{out}}$. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$ (c t_{\\text{out}})^2 = L^2 + (v t_{\\text{out}})^2 $$\nSolving for $t_{\\text{out}}$:\n$$ c^2 t_{\\text{out}}^2 - v^2 t_{\\text{out}}^2 = L^2 $$\n$$ t_{\\text{out}}^2 (c^2 - v^2) = L^2 $$\n$$ t_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{c^2 - v^2}} = \\frac{L}{c\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} $$\nThe return trip is symmetric, taking an equal amount of time, $t_{\\text{in}} = t_{\\text{out}}$. Therefore, the total round-trip time for arm 2 is:\n$$ t_2 = t_{\\text{out}} + t_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{2L}{c\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} $$\n\nNext, let's calculate the round-trip time, $t_1'$, for the light beam in arm 1, which is parallel to the motion. We must account for the proposed length contraction, so the length of this arm is $L'$. On the outbound trip, the light travels \"against the current\" of the aether wind. Its speed relative to the apparatus is $c - v$. The time for the outbound trip is:\n$$ t'_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{L'}{c - v} $$\nOn the return trip, the light travels \"with the current\". Its speed relative to the apparatus is $c + v$. The time for the return trip is:\n$$ t'_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{L'}{c + v} $$\nThe total round-trip time for arm 1 is:\n$$ t_1' = t'_{\\text{out}} + t'_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{L'}{c - v} + \\frac{L'}{c + v} $$\n$$ t_1' = \\frac{L'(c + v) + L'(c - v)}{(c - v)(c + v)} = \\frac{2L'c}{c^2 - v^2} = \\frac{2L'}{c(1 - v^2/c^2)} $$\n\nThe FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis is intended to make the travel times equal, so we set $t_1' = t_2$:\n$$ \\frac{2L'}{c(1 - v^2/c^2)} = \\frac{2L}{c\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} $$\nWe can cancel the common factor of $2/c$ from both sides:\n$$ \\frac{L'}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} $$\nNow, we solve for the contracted length $L'$:\n$$ L' = L \\frac{1 - v^2/c^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = L \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} $$\nThe problem asks for the fractional change in length, which is $(L' - L) / L$. Substituting the expression for $L'$:\n$$ \\frac{L' - L}{L} = \\frac{L\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} - L}{L} $$\nFactoring out $L$ from the numerator and canceling it with the denominator gives the final expression:\n$$ \\frac{L' - L}{L} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} - 1 $$\nThis negative value represents a contraction, as expected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} - 1}$$", "id": "1859421"}, {"introduction": "Rather than patching a broken theory, Albert Einstein rebuilt physics on new postulates, chief among them the constancy of the speed of light for all inertial observers.
