{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To understand why the luminiferous aether was such a compelling idea, it's helpful to step into the shoes of a 19th-century physicist. This exercise challenges you to apply the familiar principles of Galilean relativity to the propagation of light within this hypothetical medium. By calculating the expected speed of light as measured by a moving observer, you will uncover the core prediction of the aether model: that an observer's motion should create a detectable \"aether wind,\" making the speed of light appear anisotropic [@problem_id:1867521].", "problem": "Before the advent of special relativity, a prominent physical theory proposed the existence of a stationary, all-pervading medium called the luminiferous aether. In this model, light was considered a wave that propagates through this fixed aether at a constant speed, denoted by $c$, relative to the aether itself.\n\nConsider a spaceship traveling at a constant velocity of magnitude $v$ (where $v < c$) with respect to the stationary aether. An observer aboard the spaceship conducts an experiment by sending out two light pulses from the ship. One pulse is emitted in the direction of the spaceship's motion (the \"forward\" pulse), and the other is emitted in the direction opposite to the ship's motion (the \"backward\" pulse).\n\nAssuming the validity of the luminiferous aether hypothesis and Galilean principles of relative motion, determine the speed of the forward pulse and the speed of the backward pulse as measured by the observer on the spaceship. Present your answer as a pair of symbolic expressions for the speeds $(v_{\\text{forward}}, v_{\\text{backward}})$.", "solution": "Let's establish two inertial reference frames. Let frame $S$ be the rest frame of the luminiferous aether. Let frame $S'$ be the reference frame of the spaceship, which is moving with a velocity $\\vec{v}$ relative to the aether. Without loss of generality, let's align the x-axis with the direction of the spaceship's motion, so $\\vec{v} = v\\hat{x}$.\n\nThe problem is based on the aether hypothesis, which predates special relativity. Therefore, we must use the Galilean transformation for velocities, not the Lorentz transformation. The Galilean velocity addition rule states that if an object has velocity $\\vec{u}$ as measured in frame $S$, its velocity $\\vec{u}'$ as measured in frame $S'$ is given by:\n$$ \\vec{u}' = \\vec{u} - \\vec{v} $$\n\nFirst, let's consider the forward-moving light pulse. According to the aether hypothesis, light travels at speed $c$ relative to the aether (frame $S$). The forward pulse travels in the same direction as the spaceship. So, its velocity in the aether frame $S$ is $\\vec{u}_{\\text{forward}} = c\\hat{x}$.\nTo find the velocity of this forward pulse as measured by the observer on the spaceship (frame $S'$), we apply the Galilean transformation:\n$$ \\vec{u}'_{\\text{forward}} = \\vec{u}_{\\text{forward}} - \\vec{v} = c\\hat{x} - v\\hat{x} = (c - v)\\hat{x} $$\nThe speed is the magnitude of this velocity vector. Since $v < c$, the quantity $(c-v)$ is positive. Therefore, the speed of the forward pulse as measured on the spaceship is:\n$$ v_{\\text{forward}} = |\\vec{u}'_{\\text{forward}}| = c - v $$\n\nNext, let's consider the backward-moving light pulse. This pulse travels in the direction opposite to the spaceship's motion. In the aether frame $S$, its velocity is $\\vec{u}_{\\text{backward}} = -c\\hat{x}$.\nAgain, we apply the Galilean transformation to find the velocity as measured by the observer on the spaceship (frame $S'$):\n$$ \\vec{u}'_{\\text{backward}} = \\vec{u}_{\\text{backward}} - \\vec{v} = -c\\hat{x} - v\\hat{x} = -(c + v)\\hat{x} $$\nThe speed is the magnitude of this velocity vector.\n$$ v_{\\text{backward}} = |\\vec{u}'_{\\text{backward}}| = |-(c + v)| = c + v $$\n\nThus, according to the aether hypothesis, the observer on the spaceship would measure the speed of the forward pulse to be $c-v$ and the speed of the backward pulse to be $c+v$. This result famously contradicts the second postulate of special relativity, which states that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.\n\nThe ordered pair of speeds $(v_{\\text{forward}}, v_{\\text{backward}})$ is $(c-v, c+v)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} c - v & c + v \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1867521"}, {"introduction": "The prediction of an \"aether wind\" led to one of history's most famous null results when the Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect it. This forced physicists to propose explanations to save the aether theory. One such proposal was the \"aether drag\" hypothesis, which suggested that the Earth drags the aether along with it, much like a moving ball drags the air around it. This practice asks you to analyze the logical consequence of this idea: if the aether is perfectly dragged, what would an interferometer on Earth actually measure [@problem_id:1867464]?", "problem": "In the late 19th-century, physicists hypothesized the existence of a luminiferous aether as a medium for the propagation of light. The famous Michelson-Morley experiment was designed to detect the motion of the Earth through this stationary aether. When the experiment yielded a null result, some physicists proposed the \"aether drag\" hypothesis as an explanation. This model posits that the aether is not stationary, but is instead dragged along perfectly and completely by massive bodies like the Earth.\n\nConsider a Michelson interferometer located in a laboratory on Earth's surface. The interferometer consists of a light source emitting monochromatic light of wavelength $\\lambda$, a beam splitter, and two mirrors. The beam splitter divides the light into two perpendicular beams. Each beam travels a distance $L$ to its respective mirror and is reflected back to the beam splitter, where the beams are recombined to create an interference pattern. The two arms of the interferometer are of precisely equal length.\n\nAssuming the complete aether drag hypothesis is correct, meaning the aether within the laboratory is stationary with respect to the apparatus, what is the predicted numerical value for the fringe shift, $\\Delta N$, observed as the entire apparatus is slowly rotated by 90 degrees? The speed of light in the aether's rest frame is $c$.", "solution": "We are asked to compute the predicted fringe shift in a Michelson interferometer upon a slow rotation by 90 degrees under the assumption of complete aether drag. The hypothesis states that the aether is perfectly dragged by the Earth, so in the laboratory frame the aether is at rest with respect to the apparatus. Therefore, the speed of light relative to the apparatus is isotropic and equal to $c$ in all directions.\n\nPhysical principles and setup:\n- Light of wavelength $\\lambda$ is split into two perpendicular beams.\n- Each beam traverses a distance $L$ to a mirror and returns, so the geometric round-trip path length in each arm is $2L$.\n- Under complete aether drag, the light speed is $c$ in both arms regardless of orientation, and there is no aether wind relative to the apparatus.\n\nCompute the round-trip times for each arm:\n- Let $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ be the round-trip travel times in arms $1$ and $2$. Since the speed is isotropic and equal to $c$,\n$$\nt_{1}=\\frac{2L}{c},\\qquad t_{2}=\\frac{2L}{c}.\n$$\nHence the time difference is\n$$\n\\Delta t \\equiv t_{1}-t_{2}=0.\n$$\n\nCompute the phases accumulated in each arm:\n- The optical phase accumulated by a beam is $\\phi=2\\pi f\\,t$, where $f$ is the frequency.

The round-trip times remain $t_{1}'=2L/c$ and $t_{2}'=2L/c$, so $\\Delta t'=0$ and $\\Delta\\phi'=0$.\n\nFringe shift upon rotation:\n- The fringe shift is the change in the phase difference in units of $2\\pi$,\n$$\n\\Delta N=\\frac{\\Delta\\phi'-\\Delta\\phi}{2\\pi}.\n$$\nSince both $\\Delta\\phi$ and $\\Delta\\phi'$ are zero,\n$$\n\\Delta N=0.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the predicted fringe shift upon a $90$-degree rotation is zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "1867464"}, {"introduction": "While aether drag was one attempt to explain the Michelson-Morley null result, a more radical and ultimately more fruitful idea was proposed by George FitzGerald and Hendrik Lorentz. They hypothesized that the null result wasn't due to a lack of aether wind, but because the interferometer's arm physically contracts along its direction of motion. In this exercise, you will work backward from the experimental data; assuming a stationary aether and a null result, you will derive the exact mathematical form of the required length contraction [@problem_id:396348].
