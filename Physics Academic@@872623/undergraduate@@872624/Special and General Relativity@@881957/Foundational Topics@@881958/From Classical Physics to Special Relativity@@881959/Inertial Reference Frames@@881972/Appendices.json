The origin can be considered the boat's starting position.\n\nThe problem requires the velocity of the ASV relative to the ground, $\\vec{v}_{bg}$, to be directed purely North. This means its x-component must be zero. We can write this vector as:\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{bg} = v_{bg} \\hat{j}\n$$\nwhere $v_{bg}$ is the magnitude we need to find, and $\\hat{j}$ is the unit vector in the North (positive y) direction.\n\nThe velocity of the ASV relative to the ground is the vector sum of its velocity relative to the water, $\\vec{v}_{bw}$, and the velocity of the water relative to the ground, $\\vec{v}_{wg}$.\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{bg} = \\vec{v}_{bw} + \\vec{v}_{wg}\n$$\n\nLet's decompose the given velocities into their x and y components.\n\nFirst, consider the velocity of the water relative to the ground, $\\vec{v}_{wg}$. Its magnitude is given as $v_{water} = 1.80 \\, \\text{m/s}$. The direction is $25.0^{\\circ}$ east of south. In our coordinate system, South is the negative y-direction.
