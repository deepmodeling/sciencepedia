One major source of energy loss for electrons is bremsstrahlung radiation, emitted when they are accelerated by the electromagnetic fields of atomic nuclei in the beam pipe walls or residual gas.\n\nConsider a simplified model of this process. A highly relativistic electron with a constant velocity $v$ and Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ travels on a trajectory that passes a stationary, heavy atomic nucleus. Let the impact parameter, defined as the minimum perpendicular distance between the electron's initial path and the nucleus, be denoted by $b$.
