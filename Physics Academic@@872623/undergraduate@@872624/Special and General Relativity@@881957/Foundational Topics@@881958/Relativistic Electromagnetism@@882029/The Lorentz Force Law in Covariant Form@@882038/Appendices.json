We will use the Minkowski metric with signature $(+,-,-,-)$, i.e., $\\eta_{\\mu\\nu} = \\text{diag}(1, -1, -1, -1)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the necessary quantities in the lab frame $S$. The particle's 3-velocity is $\\vec{v} = (v_x, 0, v_z)$. The magnitude squared of the velocity is $v^2 = v_x^2 + v_z^2$.
