The geometry of this spacetime is governed by the Minkowski metric $\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$ with the signature $(+1, -1, -1, -1)$. In a particular inertial reference frame, a uniform static electromagnetic field exists in the region between two very large, parallel conducting plates.

Outside the plates, the field is zero. The problem states the plates are parallel to the $yz$-plane. This means the electric field is directed along the $x$-axis. We can assume the field points in the positive $x$-direction (from the positive plate to the negative plate). Since the charges are static, there is no magnetic field. Therefore, the field components in the given inertial frame are:\n$\\mathbf{E} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0}, 0, 0\\right)$\n$\\mathbf{B} = (0, 0, 0)$\n\nThe electric and magnetic field components are thus:\n$E_x = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0}$, $E_y = 0$, $E_z = 0$\n$B_x = 0$, $B_y = 0$, $B_z = 0$\n\nThe electromagnetic field strength tensor is constructed from these fields. We begin with the covariant tensor, $F_{\\mu\\nu}$, whose components in Cartesian coordinates $x^\\mu = (ct, x, y, z)$ are given by the matrix:\n$$\nF_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  E_x/c  E_y/c  E_z/c \\\\ -E_x/c  0  -B_z  B_y \\\\ -E_y/c  B_z  0  -B_x \\\\ -E_z/c  -B_y  B_x  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting the components of our specific $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ fields into this matrix, we get:\n$$\nF_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{\\sigma}{c\\epsilon_0}  0  0 \\\\ -\\frac{\\sigma}{c\\epsilon_0}  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the contravariant tensor, $F^{\\mu\\nu}$.
