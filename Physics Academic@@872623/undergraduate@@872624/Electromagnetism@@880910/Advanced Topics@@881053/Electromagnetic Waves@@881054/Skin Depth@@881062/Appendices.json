The material is characterized by its electrical conductivity $\\sigma$ and permittivity $\\epsilon$. To assess its suitability for high-frequency shielding, the team measures the skin depth, $\\delta$, which is the distance into the material at which the amplitude of an incident electromagnetic wave decays to $1/e$ of its value at the surface.\n\nTheir experiment yields the following data:\n1. At an initial frequency of $f_1$, the measured skin depth is $\\delta_1$.\n2. When the frequency is increased to $f_2 = 4 f_1$, the new measured skin depth is $\\delta_2$, which is found to be very close to $\\delta_1 / 2$.\n\nBased on this experimental observation relating frequency and skin depth, how should this material be classified in this frequency range?

The experimental results are contradictory and physically impossible.", "solution": "Let the complex wavenumber for a plane wave in the medium be $k = \\alpha + i\\beta$. The wave's electric field will have a spatial dependence of the form $e^{ikz} = e^{i\\alpha z}e^{-\\beta z}$. The term $e^{-\\beta z}$ represents the exponential decay of the wave's amplitude with depth $z$. The skin depth, $\\delta$, is defined as the depth at which the amplitude decays to $1/e$ of its surface value, which means $\\delta = 1/\\beta$. The imaginary part of the wavenumber, $\\beta$, is the attenuation constant.\n\nThe wavenumber $k$ is determined by the dispersion relation:\n$$k^2 = \\mu\\epsilon\\omega^2 + i\\omega\\mu\\sigma$$\nFor a non-magnetic material, $\\mu = \\mu_0$. We can factor this expression as:\n$$k^2 = \\mu_0\\epsilon\\omega^2 \\left(1 + i\\frac{\\sigma}{\\omega\\epsilon}\\right)$$\n\nWe now examine the frequency dependence of the skin depth $\\delta$ in the two standard limits.\n\n1.  **Good conductor limit ($\\sigma \\gg \\omega\\epsilon$):**\n    In this case, the displacement current term is negligible compared to the conduction current term. The dispersion relation simplifies to:\n    $$k^2 \\approx i\\omega\\mu_0\\sigma$$\n    To find $k$, we take the square root, using $\\sqrt{i} = (1+i)/\\sqrt{2}$:\n    $$k = \\alpha + i\\beta \\approx \\sqrt{\\omega\\mu_0\\sigma} \\frac{(1+i)}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\mu_0\\sigma}{2}}(1+i)$$\n    From this, we identify the attenuation constant $\\beta = \\text{Im}(k) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\mu_0\\sigma}{2}}$.\n    The skin depth is therefore:\n    $$\\delta = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\omega\\mu_0\\sigma}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi f \\mu_0 \\sigma}}$$\n    This shows that for a good conductor, the skin depth is proportional to the inverse square root of the frequency, $\\delta \\propto f^{-1/2}$. If the frequency is quadrupled ($f_2 = 4f_1$), the new skin depth will be $\\delta_2 \\propto (4f_1)^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{2} (f_1)^{-1/2} \\propto \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_1$. This matches the experimental observation.\n\n2.  **Poor conductor limit ($\\sigma \\ll \\omega\\epsilon$):**\n    In this case, the conduction current is negligible. We can analyze the full dispersion relation by factoring out the dielectric term and using the Taylor approximation $\\sqrt{1+x} \\approx 1+x/2$ for small $x$:\n    $$k = \\omega\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\epsilon}\\sqrt{1 + i\\frac{\\sigma}{\\omega\\epsilon}} \\approx \\omega\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\epsilon}\\left(1 + i\\frac{\\sigma}{2\\omega\\epsilon}\\right) = \\omega\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\epsilon} + i\\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_0}{\\epsilon}}$$\n    The attenuation constant is $\\beta = \\text{Im}(k) \\approx \\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_0}{\\epsilon}}$.\n    The skin depth is:\n    $$\\delta = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\approx \\frac{2}{\\sigma}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\mu_0}}$$\n    In this limit, the skin depth is approximately independent of frequency. This contradicts the experimental results.\n\n3.  **Perfect insulator ($\\sigma=0$):**\n    If $\\sigma=0$, then $\\beta=0$ and the skin depth $\\delta$ is infinite. The wave propagates without attenuation, which is inconsistent with the measurement of a finite skin depth.\n\nSince the experimental data shows that $\\delta \\propto f^{-1/2}$, the material behaves as a good conductor in the tested frequency range.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1626245"}, {"introduction": "The skin effect is not equally important in all applications; its significance is dramatically dictated by the frequency of the alternating current.
