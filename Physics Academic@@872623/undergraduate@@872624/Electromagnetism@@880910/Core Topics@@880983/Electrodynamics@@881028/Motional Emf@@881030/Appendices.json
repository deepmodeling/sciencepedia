This problem is fundamental to understanding how motion in a magnetic field can convert gravitational potential energy into both kinetic energy and dissipated heat, leading to the concept of a terminal velocity.", "problem": "A conducting rod of mass $m$ and length $L$ is free to slide without friction down a pair of vertical, parallel, conducting rails. The rails are separated by the same distance $L$ and are connected at their top ends by a resistor of resistance $R$. The rod and rails are assumed to have negligible electrical resistance. This entire setup is situated in a uniform and constant magnetic field of magnitude $B$, which is directed horizontally and perpendicular to the plane formed by the rails. The rod is released from rest at the top of the rails and begins to fall under the influence of gravity, for which the acceleration is $g$. As the rod falls, a motional electromotive force is induced, driving a current through the resistor. This, in turn, creates a magnetic braking force that opposes the rod's motion. The rod eventually approaches a constant terminal velocity.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total energy dissipated as heat in the resistor to the kinetic energy gained by the rod, evaluated at the precise instant the rod's speed reaches exactly one-half of its terminal velocity. Present your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression.", "solution": "Let $v$ be the instantaneous downward velocity of the conducting rod.\n\nFirst, we determine the terminal velocity, $v_T$.

Let the rod fall a distance $h$. The work done by gravity is $W_g = mgh$. This work is converted into two forms of energy: the kinetic energy of the rod, $K$, and the energy dissipated as heat in the resistor, $E_{diss}$.

Therefore, the external force, $\\vec{F}_{ext}$, must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the magnetic drag force, $\\vec{F}_{m}$, acting on the rod. The work done is then the integral of this force over the distance traveled.\n\nFirst, let's establish the geometry of the system. The rod's position along the $x$-axis at any time $t$ is given by $x(t) = vt$. The two rails are described by the lines $y = x \\tan(\\alpha/2)$ and $y = -x \\tan(\\alpha/2)$. At a given position $x$, the rod extends from $y_{bottom} = -x \\tan(\\alpha/2)$ to $y_{top} = x \\tan(\\alpha/2)$. The length of the conducting segment of the rod that forms part of the closed circuit is therefore $L_{eff}(x) = y_{top} - y_{bottom} = 2x \\tan(\\alpha/2)$. As a function of time, this length is $L_{eff}(t) = 2(vt) \\tan(\\alpha/2)$.\n\nNext, we calculate the induced electromotive force (EMF), $\\mathcal{E}$, in the closed loop formed by the rod and the rails.
