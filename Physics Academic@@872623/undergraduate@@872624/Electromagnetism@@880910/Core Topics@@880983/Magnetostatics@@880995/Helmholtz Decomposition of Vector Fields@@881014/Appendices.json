The flow is incompressible and non-rotational, representing a uniform translation.\n\nE. The flow represents a shear flow with zero divergence and non-zero curl.", "solution": "To characterize the nature of the fluid flow described by the velocity field $\\vec{v}(\\vec{r}) = \\alpha \\vec{r}$, we need to analyze its divergence and its curl. The divergence of a velocity field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{v}$, measures the \"source\" or \"sink\" strength at a point, corresponding to expansion or compression. A flow is called incompressible if its divergence is zero. The curl of a velocity field, $\\nabla \\times \\vec{v}$, measures the local rotational motion, or vorticity. A flow is called irrotational if its curl is zero.\n\nFirst, let's write the vector field $\\vec{v}$ in its component form:\n$$\n\\vec{v} = \\alpha \\vec{r} = \\alpha(x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j} + z\\hat{k}) = (\\alpha x)\\hat{i} + (\\alpha y)\\hat{j} + (\\alpha z)\\hat{k}\n$$\nSo, the components are $v_x = \\alpha x$, $v_y = \\alpha y$, and $v_z = \\alpha z$.\n\nNow, we calculate the divergence of $\\vec{v}$:\nThe divergence is defined in Cartesian coordinates as $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{v} = \\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z}$.\nSubstituting the components of our velocity field:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{v} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\alpha x) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\alpha y) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(\\alpha z)\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{v} = \\alpha + \\alpha + \\alpha = 3\\alpha\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\alpha$ is a positive constant. Therefore, the divergence $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{v} = 3\\alpha$ is a positive constant. Since the divergence is non-zero, the flow is compressible. The positive sign indicates that the flow is expansive, meaning there is a net outflow of fluid from any infinitesimal volume. This result immediately rules out any options claiming the flow is incompressible (zero divergence), such as options A, D, and E.\n\nNext, we calculate the curl of $\\vec{v}$:\nThe curl is defined in Cartesian coordinates by the determinant:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{v} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{i}  \\hat{j}  \\hat{k} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\\\ v_x  v_y  v_z \\end{vmatrix} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{i}  \\hat{j}  \\hat{k} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\alpha x  \\alpha y  \\alpha z \\end{vmatrix}\n$$\nLet's compute the components of the curl:\nThe $\\hat{i}$ component is $(\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial z}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\alpha z) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(\\alpha y) = 0 - 0 = 0$.\nThe $\\hat{j}$ component is $(\\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial x}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(\\alpha x) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\alpha z) = 0 - 0 = 0$.\nThe $\\hat{k}$ component is $(\\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial y}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\alpha y) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\alpha x) = 0 - 0 = 0$.\nSo, the curl of the velocity field is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{v} = 0\\hat{i} + 0\\hat{j} + 0\\hat{k} = \\vec{0}\n$$\nSince the curl of the velocity field is the zero vector everywhere, the flow is irrotational. This means it has no local rotational motion, or zero vorticity. This result rules out any options claiming the flow has vorticity or is rotational, such as options A and C.\n\nIn summary, the flow has a positive divergence ($3\\alpha$) and zero curl. This means the flow is expansive and irrotational (has no vorticity).\n\nLet's examine the options again:\nA. The flow is purely rotational (like a solid body rotation) and incompressible. (Incorrect: curl is zero, divergence is non-zero)\nB. The flow is purely expansive (irrotational) and has no vorticity. (Correct: divergence is non-zero, curl is zero)\nC. The flow exhibits both expansion/compression and vorticity. (Incorrect: curl is zero)\nD. The flow is incompressible and non-rotational, representing a uniform translation. (Incorrect: divergence is non-zero)\nE. The flow represents a shear flow with zero divergence and non-zero curl. (Incorrect: divergence is non-zero, curl is zero)\n\nTherefore, the only option that accurately describes the flow is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1801413"}, {"introduction": "Irrotational, or curl-free, vector fields can be conveniently described by a scalar potential.
