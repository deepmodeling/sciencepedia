This H-field is determined by the external current source and is independent of the material inside the solenoid.\n\nStep 2: Define the magnetic field (B-field) in vacuum and in the material.\nIn a vacuum, the magnetic field $B_{vac}$ is related to the H-field by the permeability of free space, $\\mu_0$:\n$$B_{vac} = \\mu_0 H$$\nWhen the solenoid is filled with a magnetic material, the material becomes magnetized, and the total magnetic field inside, $B_{mat}$, is given by:\n$$B_{mat} = \\mu H$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the permeability of the material.\n\nStep 3: Define and use the relative permeability, $\\mu_r$.\nThe relative permeability $\\mu_r$ is a dimensionless factor that compares the permeability of a material to that of free space:\n$$\\mu_r = \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu_0}$$\nWe can rewrite the expression for $B_{mat}$ using $\\mu_r$:\n$$B_{mat} = \\mu H = (\\mu_r \\mu_0) H = \\mu_r (\\mu_0 H)$$\nRecognizing that $\\mu_0 H = B_{vac}$, we have the key relationship:\n$$B_{mat} = \\mu_r B_{vac}$$\nThis means the relative permeability is the ratio of the magnetic field inside the material to the magnetic field that would exist in a vacuum for the same H-field.\n$$\\mu_r = \\frac{B_{mat}}{B_{vac}}$$\n\nStep 4: Use the information provided in the problem to calculate $\\mu_r$.\nThe problem states that the magnetic field inside the alloy, $B_{mat}$, is $0.021\\%$ larger than the field in a vacuum, $B_{vac}$.
