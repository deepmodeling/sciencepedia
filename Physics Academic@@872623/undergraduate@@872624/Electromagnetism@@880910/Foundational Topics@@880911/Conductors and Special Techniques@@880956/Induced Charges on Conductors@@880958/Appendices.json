This first practice uses the power of Gauss's Law to explore the charge induced on the inner surface of a hollow conductor when a point charge is placed inside [@problem_id:1801948]. Solving this problem reveals a simple, yet profound, relationship that is independent of the conductor's specific shape, highlighting the core principles of electrostatic equilibrium.", "problem": "Consider a hollow cone constructed from a perfect conducting material. The cone is electrically grounded, maintaining it at a constant electric potential of zero. A single point charge, with a positive charge value of $q$, is placed on the axis of symmetry of the cone, at a position located within the hollow interior. Due to electrostatic induction, this point charge causes charges within the conductor to redistribute, resulting in an induced charge distribution on the surfaces of the cone.\n\nDetermine the total net charge, $Q_{in}$, that is induced on the interior surface of the hollow cone. Express your answer in terms of the given charge $q$.", "solution": "We consider the system in electrostatic equilibrium. For a perfect conductor that is grounded, the electric potential on the conductor is constant (here zero), and the electric field inside the conducting material vanishes. Any free charges reside on the surfaces. A simple approach is to apply Gauss's Law.\n\nConstruct a Gaussian surface that is entirely contained within the conducting material of the cone, enclosing the hollow interior. Since the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is zero everywhere inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the field is zero at every point on this Gaussian surface.\n\nThe electric flux $\\Phi_E$ through this closed surface is therefore zero:\n$$\n\\Phi_E = \\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = 0\n$$\nAccording to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total electric charge $Q_{\\text{enclosed}}$ inside the surface:\n$$\n\\Phi_E = \\frac{Q_{\\text{enclosed}}}{\\epsilon_0}\n$$\nThe total charge enclosed by our Gaussian surface is the sum of the point charge $q$ placed in the cavity and the total charge $Q_{in}$ induced on the interior surface of the cone. Thus, $Q_{\\text{enclosed}} = q + Q_{in}$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for the flux, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{q + Q_{in}}{\\epsilon_0} = 0\n$$\nThis immediately implies:\n$$\nq + Q_{in} = 0 \\implies Q_{in} = -q\n$$\nThis result is remarkably general and holds regardless of the specific shape of the hollow conductor (a cone, a sphere, or any other shape) or the exact position of the charge $q$ within the cavity. It relies only on the fact that the electric field inside the conductor is zero at equilibrium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-q}$$", "id": "1801948"}, {"introduction": "When a conductor is placed in an external electric field, its free charges rearrange, creating an internal field that cancels the external one within the material. This problem explores this phenomenon by examining a neutral conducting sphere in a uniform field, a classic scenario in electrostatics [@problem_id:1801960]. By applying boundary conditions and solving Laplace's equation, you will quantify this polarization effect by calculating the sphere's induced electric dipole moment.", "problem": "A neutral, solid conducting sphere of radius $a$ is placed in a vacuum. It is positioned exactly halfway between two very large, parallel conducting plates that are separated by a distance $d$. A potential difference $V_0$ is maintained between the plates. Assume that $d > 2a$ and that the plates are large enough so that the electric field between them, in the absence of the sphere, can be considered uniform. The presence of the plates imposes a specific uniform electric field on the sphere, which in turn becomes polarized, developing a distribution of induced surface charge. At distances far from the sphere (but still between the plates), the electric field generated by this induced charge is equivalent to that of an ideal point dipole located at the sphere's center. Determine the magnitude of this induced electric dipole moment. Provide your answer as an analytic expression in terms of $a$, $d$, $V_0$, and the permittivity of free space, $\\epsilon_0$.", "solution": "Let the plates be perpendicular to the $z$-axis.
