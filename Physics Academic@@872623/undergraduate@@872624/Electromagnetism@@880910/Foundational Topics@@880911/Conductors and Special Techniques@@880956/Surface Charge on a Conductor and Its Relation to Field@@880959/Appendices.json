We can apply Gauss's Law to solve this. We construct a spherical Gaussian surface with radius $r$ such that it lies entirely within the material of the conducting shell, i.e., $R_1 < r < R_2$.\n\nIn an electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field $\\vec{E}$ inside the material of a conductor must be zero. Therefore, for every point on our chosen Gaussian surface, $\\vec{E} = 0$.\n\nThe electric flux $\\Phi_E$ through this Gaussian surface is given by the integral $\\Phi_E = \\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A}$. Since $\\vec{E}=0$ everywhere on the surface, the flux is zero:\n$$ \\Phi_E = \\oint (0) \\cdot d\\vec{A} = 0 $$\n\nGauss's Law states that the net electric flux through any closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed by that surface, $Q_{enclosed}$, divided by the permittivity of free space, $\\epsilon_0$:\n$$ \\Phi_E = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_0} $$\n\nCombining these two results, we find that the total charge enclosed by our Gaussian surface must be zero:\n$$ Q_{enclosed} = 0 $$\n\nThe charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface at radius $r$ (where $R_1 < r < R_2$) consists of two parts: the charge of the electric dipole at the center, $Q_{dipole}$, and the total charge residing on the inner surface of the shell, $Q_{inner}$.\n$$ Q_{enclosed} = Q_{dipole} + Q_{inner} $$\n\nA pure electric dipole consists of two opposite charges, $+q$ and $-q$, separated by a small distance. Therefore, the net charge of the dipole is zero:\n$$ Q_{dipole} = (+q) + (-q) = 0 $$\n\nSubstituting this into our equation for the enclosed charge:\n$$ 0 = 0 + Q_{inner} $$\nThis directly implies that the total charge on the inner surface is zero:\n$$ Q_{inner} = 0 $$\n\nNote that while the *net* charge on the inner surface is zero, this does not mean there is no charge distribution. The electric field from the dipole $\\vec{p}$ induces a non-uniform surface charge density $\\sigma(\\theta, \\phi)$ on the inner surface. However, the integral of this density over the entire inner surface yields a total charge of zero.\n\nNext, we determine the charge on the outer surface, $Q_{outer}$. The problem states that the total charge of the conducting shell is $+Q$. This total charge is the sum of the charges on the inner and outer surfaces:\n$$ Q = Q_{inner} + Q_{outer} $$\n\nWe have already determined that $Q_{inner} = 0$. Substituting this value into the equation:\n$$ Q = 0 + Q_{outer} $$\nThis gives us the charge on the outer surface:\n$$ Q_{outer} = Q $$\n\nTherefore, the pair of charges is $(Q_{inner}, Q_{outer}) = (0, Q)$.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA. $(-Q, 2Q)$ - Incorrect.\nB. $(Q, 0)$ - Incorrect.\nC. $(0, Q)$ - Correct.\nD. $(-p/R_1, Q + p/R_1)$ - Incorrect.
