In this process, known as Compton scattering, the photon transfers some of its energy and momentum to the electron, causing the photon to scatter at an angle $\\theta$ relative to its original direction of motion. This energy loss manifests as an increase in the photon's wavelength. The magnitude of this wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is related to the scattering angle. A key parameter in this interaction is the Compton wavelength of the electron, a fundamental constant defined as $\\lambda_c = \\frac{h}{m_e c}$, where $h$ is the Planck constant, $m_e$ is the rest mass of the electron, and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nDetermine the specific scattering angle $\\theta$ for which the increase in the photon's wavelength is exactly one-half of the electron's Compton wavelength.
