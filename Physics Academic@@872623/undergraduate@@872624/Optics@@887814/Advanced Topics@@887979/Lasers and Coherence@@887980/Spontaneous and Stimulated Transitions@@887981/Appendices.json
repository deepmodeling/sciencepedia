Let $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x)}$. For the Integral Test to be applicable, the function $f(x)$ must be continuous, positive, and decreasing for $x \\ge 2$.\n\n1.  **Continuity:** For $x \\ge 2$, both $x$ and $\\ln(x)$ are continuous and non-zero, so $f(x)$ is continuous.\n2.  **Positivity:** For $x \\ge 2$, $x  0$ and $\\ln(x)  \\ln(2)  0$, so $f(x)$ is positive.\n3.  **Decreasing:** We can check the derivative of $f(x)$:\n    $$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( (x \\ln x)^{-1} \\right) = -1 (x \\ln x)^{-2} \\left( 1 \\cdot \\ln x + x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} \\right) = -\\frac{\\ln(x) + 1}{(x \\ln x)^2} $$\n    For $x \\ge 2$, $\\ln(x)  0$, so $\\ln(x) + 1  0$. The denominator $(x \\ln x)^2$ is also positive. Thus, $f'(x)$ is negative for all $x \\ge 2$, which means $f(x)$ is a decreasing function on this interval.\n\nSince all conditions for the Integral Test are met, the convergence of the series is the same as the convergence of the improper integral $\\int_2^{\\infty} f(x) dx$.\n$$ \\int_2^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x)} dx $$\nWe use the substitution $u = \\ln(x)$, which gives $du = \\frac{1}{x} dx$.

This means the original series $S$ does not converge absolutely.\n\n**Step 2: Test for Conditional Convergence**\n\nSince the series does not converge absolutely, we now test the original alternating series $S = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} (-1)^n \\frac{1}{n \\ln(n)}$ for convergence using the Alternating Series Test. Let $b_n = \\frac{1}{n \\ln(n)}$.\n\nThe Alternating Series Test has three conditions:\n1.  $b_n  0$ for all $n \\ge 2$. This is true since $n  0$ and $\\ln(n)  0$ for $n \\ge 2$.\n2.  The sequence $\\{b_n\\}$ must be eventually decreasing. As shown in Step 1, the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x \\ln x}$ is decreasing for $x \\ge 2$.
