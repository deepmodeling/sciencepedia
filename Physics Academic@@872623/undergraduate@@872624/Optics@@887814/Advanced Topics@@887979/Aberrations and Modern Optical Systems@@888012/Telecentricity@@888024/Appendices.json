The system is composed of two thin converging lenses, L1 and L2, both with the same positive focal length $f$. The lenses are arranged coaxially along the z-axis. The first lens, L1, is located at the coordinate $z=f$, and the second lens, L2, is located at $z=3f$. An object is placed in the plane $z=0$.\n\nFor this system to provide constant magnification, even for small shifts of the object along the z-axis, two conditions must be met simultaneously. First, the chief rays associated with any point on the object must be parallel to the z-axis in the region $z < f$. Second, the chief rays associated with any point on the image must be parallel to the z-axis in the region between lens L2 and the image plane. These conditions can be satisfied by inserting a single physical limiting aperture, the aperture stop, at a specific plane $z=z_{AS}$.\n\nDetermine the coordinate $z_{AS}$ for the aperture stop.

Let the thin lenses have focal length $f$, with $L1$ at $z=f$ and $L2$ at $z=3f$. Let the aperture stop be a plane at $z=z_{AS}$. Define distances\n$$d_{1}=z_{AS}-f,\\qquad d_{2}=3f-z_{AS},$$\nwhich are, respectively, the separations from $L1$ to the stop and from the stop to $L2$.\n\nChief rays are defined as rays that pass through the center of the aperture stop, so at the stop plane their height is $y_{AS}=0$. We represent a ray by the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} y \\\\ \\theta \\end{pmatrix}$, where $y$ is the height and $\\theta$ is the paraxial angle relative to the $z$-axis. Free-space propagation over distance $d$ is represented by $P(d)=\\begin{pmatrix} 1  d \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$, and a thin lens of focal length $f$ by $L=\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{f}  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nObject-space telecentricity (chief rays parallel to the $z$-axis for $zf$) requires that, for any object point (i.e., any ray height just before $L1$), the chief ray angle just before $L1$ equals zero.
