Determine the specific wavelength of light that will be most strongly reflected by the swollen hologram. Express your answer in nanometers (nm), rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the peak reflection wavelength from a swollen reflection hologram. We can solve this by first determining the spacing of the interference fringes recorded in the hologram, calculating how this spacing changes upon swelling, and then applying the Bragg condition for constructive interference to find the reconstructed wavelength.\n\nFirst, let's determine the initial spacing of the interference fringes within the emulsion. The hologram is recorded with two counter-propagating plane waves of wavelength $\\lambda_{\\text{rec}}$. These waves interfere to form a standing wave pattern. The reflective layers in the hologram are formed at the antinodes of this standing wave. The wavelength of the light inside the emulsion is given by $\\lambda_{\\text{rec,med}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rec}} / n$. The distance between adjacent antinodes in a standing wave is half a wavelength. Therefore, the initial spacing, $d_0$, of the reflective planes is:\n$$d_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rec,med}}}{2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rec}}}{2n}$$\n\nNext, we account for the swelling of the emulsion. The problem states that the thickness increases by 8.0%. This means the new thickness is $100\\% + 8.0\\% = 108.0\\%$ of the original thickness. The swelling factor $S$ is therefore $1.080$. Since the swelling is uniform and perpendicular to the surface, the spacing between the reflective planes increases by the same factor. The new spacing, $d_1$, is:\n$$d_1 = S \\cdot d_0 = S \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rec}}}{2n}$$\n\nNow, we consider the reconstruction process. The hologram is illuminated with white light at normal incidence. The wavelength that is most strongly reflected, $\\lambda_{\\text{view}}$, is the one that satisfies the Bragg condition for constructive interference. For reflection from planes parallel to the surface, the Bragg condition is given by:\n$$2 d_1 \\cos(\\theta_m) = m \\lambda_{\\text{view,med}}$$\nHere, $d_1$ is the plane spacing, $\\theta_m$ is the angle of the light ray with respect to the normal inside the medium, $m$ is the diffraction order, and $\\lambda_{\\text{view,med}}$ is the wavelength of the viewed light inside the medium.\n\nFor normal incidence, the light enters the medium without refraction, so the angle inside the medium is $\\theta_m = 0^\\circ$, and $\\cos(0^\\circ) = 1$. We are interested in the strongest reflection, which corresponds to the first order, $m=1$. The Bragg condition simplifies to:\n$$2 d_1 = \\lambda_{\\text{view,med}}$$\n\nThe wavelength of the viewed light inside the medium, $\\lambda_{\\text{view,med}}$, is related to its wavelength in vacuum, $\\lambda_{\\text{view}}$, by $\\lambda_{\\text{view,med}} = \\lambda_{\\text{view}} / n$. Substituting this into the simplified Bragg condition gives:\n$$2 d_1 = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{view}}}{n}$$\nSolving for the viewed wavelength in vacuum, we get:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{view}} = 2 n d_1$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $d_1$ into this equation:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{view}} = 2n \\left( S \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rec}}}{2n} \\right)$$\nThe refractive index $n$ cancels out, leading to a simple relationship:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{view}} = S \\cdot \\lambda_{\\text{rec}}$$\n\nNow we can substitute the numerical values.
