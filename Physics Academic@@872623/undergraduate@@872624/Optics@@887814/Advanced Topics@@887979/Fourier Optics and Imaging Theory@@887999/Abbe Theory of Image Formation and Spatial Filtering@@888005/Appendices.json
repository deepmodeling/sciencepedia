This practice demonstrates the core principle of image synthesis, where we selectively recombine specific diffraction orders to construct an image with new properties [@problem_id:2216575]. By filtering the diffraction pattern of a periodic object and allowing only the central order and the second orders to interfere, you will discover how the image's spatial period can be fundamentally changed, a phenomenon known as frequency doubling.", "problem": "In a coherent optical imaging system designed for materials analysis, a one-dimensional periodic object is examined using the principles of Fourier optics. The object is an amplitude grating with a fundamental spatial period of $L$. The grating's structure is such that its Fraunhofer diffraction pattern contains numerous distinct orders, including non-zero intensities for the zeroth ($n=0$) and second ($n=\\pm 2$) orders.\n\nThe grating is illuminated by a monochromatic plane wave. The transmitted light passes through a lens system that functions as a 4f spatial filtering setup. In the Fourier plane of this system, where the diffraction pattern is formed, a custom-made spatial filter is inserted. This filter is designed to block all diffraction orders completely, except for three: the central zeroth order ($n=0$) and the pair of second orders ($n=+2$ and $n=-2$).\n\nThe light from these three selected orders is then recombined by the second part of the lens system to form an image. This process, where the image is reconstructed from a subset of its spatial frequency components, is known as spatial filtering. Determine the ratio of the fundamental spatial period of the resulting image intensity pattern to the fundamental spatial period $L$ of the original object grating. Express your answer as a single real number.", "solution": "The principle of image formation in a coherent system, as described by Abbe's theory, involves two successive Fourier transforms. The object is first transformed into its spatial frequency spectrum (the diffraction pattern), which is then filtered and transformed back to form an image.\n\nStep 1: Represent the object's transmission function.\nA one-dimensional periodic object with a spatial period $L$ can be described by a complex transmission function $t_{obj}(x)$ which can be expanded into a Fourier series:\n$$t_{obj}(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n \\exp\\left(i n \\frac{2 \\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\nHere, $c_n$ are the Fourier coefficients corresponding to the different diffraction orders, and $n$ is the integer index of the order. The term $k_g = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}$ represents the fundamental angular spatial frequency of the grating. The expression can be written as:\n$$t_{obj}(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n \\exp(i n k_g x)$$\n\nStep 2: Model the spatial filtering process.\nThe first lens of the 4f system performs a Fourier transform on $t_{obj}(x)$, creating the diffraction pattern in the Fourier plane. Each term $c_n \\exp(i n k_g x)$ of the object gives rise to a spot of light (a diffraction order) in the Fourier plane at a position proportional to its spatial frequency $n k_g$. The complex amplitude of the $n$-th order spot is proportional to $c_n$.\n\nThe spatial filter in this plane is a mask that allows only the $n=0$, $n=+2$, and $n=-2$ orders to pass. Therefore, the complex amplitude distribution of the light field immediately after the filter is the sum of these three selected components:\n$$A_{filt}(x') \\propto c_0 \\delta(x') + c_2 \\delta(x' - x'_2) + c_{-2} \\delta(x' - x'_{-2})$$\nwhere $x'$ is the spatial coordinate in the Fourier plane, and $x'_{n}$ is the position of the $n$-th order. The crucial information is that only the coefficients $c_0, c_2, c_{-2}$ contribute to the final image.\n\nStep 3: Reconstruct the image.\nThe second lens performs an inverse Fourier transform on the filtered field to form the image. The complex amplitude of the final image, $A_{img}(x)$, is the sum of the wave components corresponding to the passed orders:\n$$A_{img}(x) \\propto c_0 \\exp(i \\cdot 0 \\cdot k_g x) + c_2 \\exp(i \\cdot 2 \\cdot k_g x) + c_{-2} \\exp(i \\cdot (-2) \\cdot k_g x)$$\n$$A_{img}(x) \\propto c_0 + c_2 \\exp(i 2 k_g x) + c_{-2} \\exp(-i 2 k_g x)$$\n\nStep 4: Simplify the image amplitude expression.\nFor an amplitude grating, the transmission function $t_{obj}(x)$ is a real-valued function. For any real function, its Fourier coefficients must satisfy the hermiticity condition $c_{-n} = c_n^*$, where $c_n^*$ is the complex conjugate of $c_n$. In this case, since the object is a simple amplitude grating (transparent parts on an opaque background), its transmission function is not only real but also positive, which leads to real-valued Fourier coefficients. Therefore, we have $c_{-2} = c_2$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the image amplitude:\n$$A_{img}(x) \\propto c_0 + c_2 (\\exp(i 2 k_g x) + \\exp(-i 2 k_g x))$$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta}}{2}$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$A_{img}(x) \\propto c_0 + 2c_2 \\cos(2 k_g x)$$\n\nStep 5: Determine the period of the final image intensity.\nThe observed image is an intensity pattern, $I_{img}(x)$, which is proportional to the squared magnitude of the complex amplitude:\n$$I_{img}(x) \\propto |A_{img}(x)|^2 \\propto (c_0 + 2c_2 \\cos(2 k_g x))^2$$\nTo find the fundamental period of this intensity pattern, we need to find the smallest positive value $L'$ such that $I_{img}(x+L') = I_{img}(x)$ for all $x$. The spatial dependence of the intensity is determined by the term $\\cos(2k_g x)$. Let's analyze the argument of the cosine function by substituting $k_g = 2\\pi/L$:\n$$2 k_g x = 2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right) x = \\frac{4\\pi x}{L}$$\nThe function is $I_{img}(x) \\propto (c_0 + 2c_2 \\cos(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}))^2$. Let the new period be $L'$. The period of a function of the form $\\cos(\\alpha x)$ is $2\\pi/\\alpha$.\nHere, the angular frequency of the cosine term is $\\alpha = \\frac{4\\pi}{L}$.\nThe period of the cosine term itself is:\n$$L'_{cos} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\alpha} = \\frac{2\\pi}{4\\pi/L} = \\frac{L}{2}$$\nSince the overall intensity function $I_{img}(x)$ involves this cosine (and not a higher symmetry function like $\\cos^2(x)$ which would halve the period again), its fundamental period is determined by the period of $\\cos(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L})$. The constant offset $c_0$ and the squaring operation do not change the fundamental period in this case (unless $c_0=0$, which is not generally true).\nThus, the fundamental period of the image intensity pattern is $L' = L/2$.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the required ratio.\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the new period $L'$ to the original period $L$.\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{L'}{L} = \\frac{L/2}{L} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe resulting image has a spatial period that is half of the original object's period. This phenomenon is known as frequency doubling.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The original object grating has spatial frequencies $n/L$. The filtered image is constructed from components with spatial frequencies $0$ and $\\pm 2/L$. The interference between the $+2/L$ and $-2/L$ components creates a sinusoidal pattern with a spatial frequency of $(+2/L) - (-2/L) = 4/L$ in intensity, or more correctly, the interference of plane waves with wavevectors $\\pm 2k_g$ creates a standing wave with wavevector $2k_g$, which has a spatial period of $2\\pi/(2k_g) = \\pi/k_g = \\pi/(2\\pi/L) = L/2$. The addition of the zeroth order component (a constant DC bias) modulates the contrast of this pattern but does not change its fundamental period.
