For a circular, unaberrated pupil of radius $a$, illuminated by monochromatic light of wavelength $\\lambda$, the point spread function (PSF) in the focal region is the squared modulus of the Fourier transform of the pupil function. With wavenumber $k=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$, the ideal diffraction-limited PSF for a circular aperture (Airy pattern) is\n$$\nI_{\\text{ideal}}(\\theta)\\propto \\left[\\frac{2 J_{1}\\!\\left(k a \\sin\\theta\\right)}{k a \\sin\\theta}\\right]^{2},\n$$\nwhere $J_{1}$ is the Bessel function of the first kind and $\\theta$ is the angle from the optical axis.\n\nIn the presence of aberrations, the generalized pupil function is $P(\\rho,\\varphi)=\\Pi(\\rho)\\exp\\!\\left(i\\phi(\\rho,\\varphi)\\right)$, where $\\Pi(\\rho)$ is $1$ for $0\\leq \\rho \\leq 1$ and $0$ otherwise, with $\\rho$ the normalized pupil radius.

Physically, rays from different pupil zones add less constructively on-axis and more into off-axis angles, which broadens the central lobe and increases a diffuse halo or enhanced sidelobes. Therefore, compared to the ideal Airy pattern, the aberrated PSF has a broader central peak with reduced maximum intensity, with more energy in the surrounding halo.\n\nWe can now assess the options. A is false: spherical aberration cannot make the PSF sharper than the diffraction limit set by the aperture; it reduces the Strehl ratio and broadens the core. B is false: a lateral shift requires a tilt phase term linear in pupil coordinates; spherical aberration is rotationally symmetric and does not shift the PSF. D is false: the problem specifies monochromatic light with constant index of refraction, so there is no dispersion to produce rainbow colors. E is false: while the ring structure is modified and loses contrast, aberrations do not eliminate all rings, and energy is instead redistributed into a halo and altered sidelobes.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that the central peak broadens and its peak intensity decreases, with energy redistributed into a diffuse halo, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2264577"}]}
