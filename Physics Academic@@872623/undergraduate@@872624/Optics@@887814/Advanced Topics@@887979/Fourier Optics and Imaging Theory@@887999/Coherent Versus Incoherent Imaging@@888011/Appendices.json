The system is characterized by a pupil function that is purely real and symmetric (an even function) with respect to the origin of the frequency domain. An object is placed at the input plane of this system. The object's amplitude transmittance, denoted by $o(x)$, is a purely real function of the spatial coordinate $x$. Furthermore, $o(x)$ is an odd function, meaning it satisfies the property $o(-x) = -o(x)$ for all $x$.\n\nThe system is used to form an image of this object. We are interested in the symmetry of the resulting image intensity distribution, $I(x)$, under two different illumination conditions:\n1.  **Coherent Imaging**: The object is illuminated by a uniform plane wave, and the imaging is fully coherent.\n2.  **Incoherent Imaging**: The object is illuminated by uniform, spatially incoherent light, and the imaging is fully incoherent.\n\nBased on these conditions, which of the following statements correctly describes the symmetry of the image intensity for the two cases?

The incoherent image intensity has no definite symmetry (is neither even nor odd), while the coherent image intensity is an even function.", "solution": "This problem requires us to analyze the symmetry properties of the image intensity produced by a diffraction-limited system for both coherent and incoherent imaging of an object with a specific symmetry.\n\nLet's first establish the properties of the system's Point Spread Function (PSF). The coherent PSF, denoted by $h(x)$, is the Fourier transform of the pupil function, $P(\\nu)$, where $\\nu$ is the spatial frequency.\nThe problem states that the pupil function $P(\\nu)$ is real and even. The Fourier transform of a real and even function is also a real and even function. Therefore, the coherent PSF, $h(x)$, is a real and even function, meaning $h(x) = h(-x)$.\n\nThe object's amplitude transmittance, $o(x)$, is given as a real and odd function, so $o(x) = -o(-x)$.\n\n**Case 1: Coherent Imaging**\n\nIn a coherent imaging system, the relationship between the object's complex amplitude $o(x)$ and the image's complex amplitude $g(x)$ is given by a convolution with the coherent PSF, $h(x)$:\n$$g(x) = (o * h)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} o(\\xi) h(x-\\xi) d\\xi$$\nTo determine the symmetry of the image amplitude $g(x)$, we evaluate it at $-x$:\n$$g(-x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} o(\\xi) h(-x-\\xi) d\\xi$$\nSince $h(x)$ is an even function, $h(-x-\\xi) = h(x+\\xi)$.\n$$g(-x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} o(\\xi) h(x+\\xi) d\\xi$$\nLet's perform a change of variables, $\\xi' = -\\xi$. This implies $\\xi = -\\xi'$ and $d\\xi = -d\\xi'$. The limits of integration are reversed and then flipped back by the negative sign of the differential.\n$$g(-x) = \\int_{\\infty}^{-\\infty} o(-\\xi') h(x-\\xi') (-d\\xi') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} o(-\\xi') h(x-\\xi') d\\xi'$$\nThe object amplitude $o(x)$ is an odd function, so $o(-\\xi') = -o(\\xi')$.\n$$g(-x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} [-o(\\xi')] h(x-\\xi') d\\xi' = - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} o(\\xi') h(x-\\xi') d\\xi'$$\nThe integral on the right is the definition of the convolution $(o * h)(x)$, which is $g(x)$. Therefore, we have:\n$$g(-x) = -g(x)$$\nThis shows that the image amplitude $g(x)$ is an odd function.\n\nNow, we need to find the symmetry of the coherent image intensity, $I_{coh}(x)$. The intensity is the squared magnitude of the complex amplitude:\n$$I_{coh}(x) = |g(x)|^2$$\nLet's evaluate the intensity at $-x$:\n$$I_{coh}(-x) = |g(-x)|^2$$\nUsing the result that $g(x)$ is odd, $g(-x) = -g(x)$:\n$$I_{coh}(-x) = |-g(x)|^2 = (-1)^2 |g(x)|^2 = |g(x)|^2 = I_{coh}(x)$$\nThus, the coherent image intensity, $I_{coh}(x)$, is an even function.\n\n**Case 2: Incoherent Imaging**\n\nIn an incoherent imaging system, the system is linear in intensity, not amplitude. The image intensity, $I_{inc}(x)$, is the convolution of the object intensity, $|o(x)|^2$, with the incoherent PSF. The incoherent PSF is the squared magnitude of the coherent PSF, $|h(x)|^2$.\n$$I_{inc}(x) = (|o|^2 * |h|^2)(x)$$\nFirst, let's determine the symmetry of the two functions being convolved.\nSymmetry of the object intensity:\nThe object amplitude is real and odd, $o(x) = -o(-x)$. The object intensity is $|o(x)|^2 = o(x)^2$. Let's check its symmetry:\n$$(o(-x))^2 = (-o(x))^2 = o(x)^2$$\nSo, the object intensity, $o(x)^2$, is an even function.\n\nSymmetry of the incoherent PSF:\nThe coherent PSF, $h(x)$, is real and even, $h(x) = h(-x)$. The incoherent PSF is $|h(x)|^2 = h(x)^2$. Let's check its symmetry:\n$$(h(-x))^2 = (h(x))^2$$\nSo, the incoherent PSF, $h(x)^2$, is an even function.\n\nNow we need to find the symmetry of the convolution of two even functions. Let $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$ be two even functions. Their convolution is:\n$$(f_1 * f_2)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_1(\\xi) f_2(x-\\xi) d\\xi$$\nLet's evaluate this at $-x$:\n$$(f_1 * f_2)(-x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_1(\\xi) f_2(-x-\\xi) d\\xi$$\nSince $f_2$ is even, $f_2(-x-\\xi) = f_2(x+\\xi)$.\n$$(f_1 * f_2)(-x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_1(\\xi) f_2(x+\\xi) d\\xi$$\nUsing the change of variables $\\xi' = -\\xi$, we get:\n$$(f_1 * f_2)(-x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_1(-\\xi') f_2(x-\\xi') d\\xi'$$\nSince $f_1$ is also even, $f_1(-\\xi') = f_1(\\xi')$.\n$$(f_1 * f_2)(-x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_1(\\xi') f_2(x-\\xi') d\\xi' = (f_1 * f_2)(x)$$\nThe convolution of two even functions is an even function.\nSince both the object intensity $o(x)^2$ and the incoherent PSF $h(x)^2$ are even functions, their convolution, the incoherent image intensity $I_{inc}(x)$, must also be an even function.\n\n**Conclusion**\nFor the given conditions, the coherent image intensity is an even function, and the incoherent image intensity is also an even function.
