This first exercise bridges the gap between a lens's geometry and its optical behavior. By applying the Lensmaker's equation to a simple plano-convex lens, you will first determine its focal length $f$ from its radius of curvature $R$ and refractive index $n_p$, and then use the thin lens equation to predict the precise location of an image [@problem_id:2269180].", "problem": "In a micro-optics experiment, a microlens is fabricated by depositing a small, perfectly transparent droplet of a polymer onto a flat substrate.
