By considering a lens that is partially blocked, we move beyond simple ray tracing diagrams to a deeper understanding of how every part of a lens contributes to the formation of the complete image. This practice [@problem_id:2251109] is crucial for appreciating why image brightness, not its completeness, is affected when the lens aperture is reduced.", "problem": "A photographer is using a camera that can be modeled as a single thin converging lens. An object, a 4.0 cm tall arrow pointing upwards, is placed on the principal axis at a distance of 30.0 cm from the lens. The lens has a focal length of 10.0 cm. Due to a malfunction, the lens cap remains stuck over the bottom half of the lens, rendering it opaque. The top half of the lens is clear. Which of the following statements correctly describes the image formed on the camera's sensor?\n\nA. An inverted image with a height of 1.0 cm is formed.\n\nB. An upright image with a height of 2.0 cm is formed.\n\nC. An inverted image with a height of 2.0 cm is formed.\n\nD. Only the top half of the object is imaged, forming an inverted image of height 1.0 cm.\n\nE.
