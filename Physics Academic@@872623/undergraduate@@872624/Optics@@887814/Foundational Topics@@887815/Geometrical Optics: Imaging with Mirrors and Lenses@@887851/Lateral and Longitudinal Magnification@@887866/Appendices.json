We begin with the thin lens equation, which relates the object distance $s_o$, the image distance $s_i$, and the focal length $f$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s_o} + \\frac{1}{s_i} = \\frac{1}{f}\n$$\nThe lateral magnification, $m_T$, is defined as the ratio of the image height to the object height, which is given by the relation:\n$$\nm_T = -\\frac{s_i}{s_o}\n$$\nThe longitudinal magnification, $m_L$, describes how a small length element along the principal axis is magnified. It is defined as the ratio of an infinitesimal change in image position, $ds_i$, to the corresponding infinitesimal change in object position, $ds_o$. Thus, $m_L = \\frac{ds_i}{ds_o}$.

We can therefore divide both sides by $|m_T|$:\n$$\n|m_T| = 1\n$$\nThis implies that the magnitude of the lateral magnification must be unity. Using the definition of $m_T$:\n$$\n\\left| -\\frac{s_i}{s_o} \\right| = 1\n$$\nSince the problem states a real image is formed from what is implicitly a real object, both $s_o$ and $s_i$ are positive distances. Therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{s_i}{s_o} = 1 \\implies s_i = s_o\n$$\nNow we substitute this condition, $s_i = s_o$, back into the thin lens equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s_o} + \\frac{1}{s_o} = \\frac{1}{f}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{2}{s_o} = \\frac{1}{f}\n$$\nFinally, solving for the object distance $s_o$ gives:\n$$\ns_o = 2f\n$$\nThis is the unique object distance for which the magnitudes of the lateral and longitudinal magnifications are equal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2f}$$", "id": "2238111"}, {"introduction": "With the theoretical foundation in place, the next step is direct application.
