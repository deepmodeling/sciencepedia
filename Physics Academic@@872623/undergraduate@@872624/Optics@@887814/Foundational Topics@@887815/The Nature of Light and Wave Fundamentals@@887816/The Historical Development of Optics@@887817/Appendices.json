Often simplified as the \"principle of least time,\" it more accurately states that light travels along a path of stationary time—which can be a minimum, maximum, or saddle point. This exercise provides a fascinating and concrete demonstration of a physical path corresponding to a local maximum in travel time, challenging a simplified understanding of this profound principle [@problem_id:2263477].", "problem": "An elliptical acoustic mirror is used in a \"whispering gallery.\" The gallery is modeled in two dimensions, with the wall following an ellipse described by the equation $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, with semi-major axis $a = 13.0$ m and semi-minor axis $b = 5.0$ m. The two foci of the ellipse are located at $F_1 = (-c, 0)$ and $F_2 = (c, 0)$, where $c = \\sqrt{a^2-b^2}$.\n\nA sound source at focus $F_1$ emits a ray that travels to the point $P=(0, b)$ on the wall and reflects towards the focus $F_2$, where it is detected. The length of this physical path is $L_{refl}$.\n\nTo analyze the nature of this path, an engineer considers a hypothetical alternative path. This path goes from the source at $F_1$ to a point $Q$ and then to the detector at $F_2$. The point $Q$ is displaced from $P$ along the y-axis towards the center of the ellipse by a small positive distance $\\delta$, such that the coordinates of $Q$ are $(0, b-\\delta)$. The length of this hypothetical path is $L_{hypo}$.\n\nIn the limit of a very small displacement ($\\delta \\to 0$), the difference in path lengths, $\\Delta L = L_{refl} - L_{hypo}$, becomes directly proportional to $\\delta$. Calculate the value of the proportionality constant, $\\frac{\\Delta L}{\\delta}$.

This path runs from $F_1$ to the point $P=(0,b)=(0, 5.0)$ and then to $F_2$. By the definition of an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on its perimeter to the two foci is a constant equal to $2a$. Therefore, the length of this path is:\n$$\nL_{refl} = 2a = 2(13.0) = 26.0 \\, \\text{m}\n$$\n\nNow, we calculate the length of the hypothetical path, $L_{hypo}$.

The positive sign of this value indicates that for a small displacement $\\delta > 0$, the path difference $\\Delta L$ is positive, meaning $L_{refl} > L_{hypo}$.

When this setup is illuminated from directly above with monochromatic light of wavelength $\\lambda$, a pattern of concentric bright and dark rings is observed in the reflected light.\n\nAssuming the paraxial approximation is valid (i.e., the vertical thickness of the air film is always much smaller than the horizontal distance from the center), derive an expression for the radius, $r_m$, of the $m$-th dark fringe. The central spot, where the lens touches the plate, corresponds to the zeroth dark fringe ($m=0$). Your final expression should be in terms of the radius of curvature $R$, the wavelength $\\lambda$, and the fringe order $m$.", "solution": "Let the local thickness of the air film at radial distance $r$ from the point of contact be $t(r)$.
