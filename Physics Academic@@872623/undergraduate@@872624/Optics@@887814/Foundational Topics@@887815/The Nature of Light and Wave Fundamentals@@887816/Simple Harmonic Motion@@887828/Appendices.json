While the total energy remains constant in an ideal system, its form changes throughout the oscillation cycle. This practice explores this fundamental principle by asking you to find the exact positions where the energy is perfectly balanced between its kinetic and potential forms. Understanding this energy distribution is key to analyzing the dynamics of any oscillating system, from a simple pendulum to the sophisticated cantilever of an Atomic Force Microscope as described here [@problem_id:2214109].", "problem": "A silicon cantilever, a key component in an advanced Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), oscillates in simple harmonic motion (SHM) when probing a surface. The cantilever has an effective mass $m$ and oscillates with a characteristic angular frequency $\\omega$. The motion is constrained along a single axis, which we label as the $x$-axis, with the equilibrium point at $x=0$. The maximum displacement from equilibrium is the amplitude $A$. For calibration purposes, it is necessary to identify the specific points in the cantilever's trajectory where its energy is evenly distributed between kinetic and potential forms. Determine all positions $x$ at which the kinetic energy of the cantilever is precisely equal to its potential energy. Express your answer(s) in terms of the amplitude $A$.", "solution": "Let the position of the cantilever at any time $t$ be $x(t)$. Since the cantilever undergoes simple harmonic motion (SHM), we can describe its potential energy $U$ and kinetic energy $K$.\n\nThe potential energy of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by $U = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2$, where $k$ is the effective spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position. The angular frequency $\\omega$ is related to the mass $m$ and spring constant $k$ by the equation $\\omega^2 = \\frac{k}{m}$, which allows us to write $k = m\\omega^2$. Substituting this into the potential energy expression gives:\n$$U = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2$$\n\nThe total mechanical energy $E$ of the oscillator is constant. It can be expressed as the maximum potential energy, which occurs at the maximum displacement (the amplitude, $A$).\n$$E = U_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{2} k A^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 A^2$$\n\nThe kinetic energy $K$ at any position $x$ is given by the difference between the total energy $E$ and the potential energy $U$ at that position, based on the principle of conservation of energy ($E = K + U$).\n$$K = E - U = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 A^2 - \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (A^2 - x^2)$$\n\nThe problem requires us to find the positions $x$ where the kinetic energy is equal to the potential energy, i.e., $K = U$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (A^2 - x^2) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 $$\n\nSince the cantilever is oscillating, $m$ and $\\omega$ are non-zero. Therefore, we can cancel the common factor $\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2$ from both sides of the equation.\n$$ A^2 - x^2 = x^2 $$\n\nNow, we solve for $x^2$:\n$$ A^2 = 2x^2 $$\n$$ x^2 = \\frac{A^2}{2} $$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us the positions $x$:\n$$ x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{A^2}{2}} = \\pm \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$ x = \\pm \\frac{A\\sqrt{2}}{2} $$\n\nThus, there are two positions where the kinetic and potential energies are equal: $x = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}A$ and $x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}A$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}A & \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}A \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2214109"}, {"introduction": "It's a common misconception that any motion that repeats itself periodically is simple harmonic motion. The defining characteristic of SHM is very specific: the restoring force must be directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium ($F \\propto -x$). This exercise challenges you to apply this rigorous definition to a familiar scenario—a bouncing ball—and determine whether its periodic motion qualifies as SHM [@problem_id:2214090]. This type of critical analysis is essential for accurately modeling physical systems.", "problem": "A small, perfectly elastic ball of mass $m$ is dropped from a height $H$ onto a perfectly rigid, horizontal surface. It then bounces vertically, always returning to the same height $H$ due to the perfectly elastic nature of the collisions. Let $y$ be the vertical position of the ball, measured positive upwards from the surface, so the surface is at $y=0$. The ball's motion is thus confined to the range $0 \\le y \\le H$. Let $g$ be the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity. The duration of each collision with the surface is non-zero but extremely short. We are interested in determining if this periodic motion can be classified as simple harmonic motion.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the acceleration, $a$, of the ball as a function of its position, $y$?\n\nA. The acceleration is directly proportional to the negative of the displacement from the midpoint of the motion: $a \\propto -(y - H/2)$.\n\nB. The acceleration has a constant value $a = -g$ throughout the entire motion, including the bounce.\n\nC. The acceleration has a constant value $a = -g$ whenever the ball is not in contact with the surface ($y > 0$), and it becomes a large, positive value for a brief interval of time during the bounce at $y=0$.\n\nD. The acceleration is zero at the peak of the trajectory ($y=H$) and is a large negative value during the bounce at $y=0$.\n\nE. The acceleration is a linear function of position, given by $a = g(1 - 2y/H)$.", "solution": "Let $y$ be measured upward from the surface, with $y=0$ at the surface and $0 \\le y \\le H$. The vertical acceleration is $a=\\ddot{y}$. By Newton’s second law, $m\\ddot{y}=\\sum F_{y}$ at each instant.\n\nDuring free flight (when the ball is not in contact with the surface, so $y>0$), the only vertical force is gravity, $F_{g}=-mg$. Hence\n$$\nm\\ddot{y}=-mg \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a=\\ddot{y}=-g.\n$$\n\nDuring the brief collision at $y=0$, there is an additional upward normal force $N(t)$ from the surface. Then\n$$\nm\\ddot{y}=N(t)-mg \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a=\\ddot{y}=\\frac{N(t)}{m}-g.\n$$\nBecause the collision is perfectly elastic, the speed just after the bounce equals the speed just before, with reversed sign.

Consequently $N(t)$, and thus $a=\\frac{N(t)}{m}-g$, is large and positive for a very short time interval during contact.\n\nTherefore:\n- For $y>0$ (no contact), $a=-g$.\n- At $y=0$ during the brief collision, $a$ becomes large and positive for a short interval.\n\nThis behavior is not simple harmonic motion, which would require $a$ to be proportional to the negative of the displacement from equilibrium, $a=-\\omega^{2}\\left(y-y_{0}\\right)$, i.e., linear in $y$ at all times. Options proposing $a$ linear in $y$ (A or E) are incorrect. It is also incorrect that $a=-g$ during the bounce (B), and $a$ is not zero at the peak (at $y=H$, $a=-g$), nor large negative during the bounce (D). The only accurate description is that $a=-g$ in flight and becomes a large positive value briefly during the bounce.\n\nHence the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2214090"}, {"introduction": "The principles of simple harmonic motion extend far beyond mechanical systems; they are the foundation for understanding waves, including light.
