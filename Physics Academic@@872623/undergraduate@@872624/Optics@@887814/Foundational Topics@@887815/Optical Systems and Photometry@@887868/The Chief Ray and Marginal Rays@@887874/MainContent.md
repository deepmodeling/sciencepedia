## Introduction
In the study of optical instruments, from a simple magnifying glass to a sophisticated space telescope, one is faced with a seemingly insurmountable challenge: light travels along an infinite number of paths, or rays. Tracing every possible ray to understand how an image is formed is impossible. Fortunately, the fundamental performance of any optical system can be characterized by tracing just a few carefully chosen representative rays. This powerful simplification is at the heart of [geometrical optics](@entry_id:175509) and practical [lens design](@entry_id:174168).

This article addresses this challenge by focusing on the two most important of these representative rays: the **[chief ray](@entry_id:165818)** and the **marginal rays**. Understanding these concepts provides a complete framework for analyzing the location, brightness, sharpness, and extent of an image. You will learn that the behavior of these rays is not arbitrary but is strictly governed by physical apertures within the system known as stops and their corresponding pupils.

The following chapters will guide you from fundamental principles to advanced applications. In **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will precisely define the chief and marginal rays and introduce the critical concepts of the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170), [field stop](@entry_id:174952), [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672), and [exit pupil](@entry_id:167465). In **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will explore how these rays are used to quantify real-world system performance, from the [depth of field](@entry_id:170064) in a camera to the classification of [optical aberrations](@entry_id:163452) and the design of high-performance microscopes. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will offer guided problems to help you apply these concepts and develop an intuitive understanding of [ray tracing](@entry_id:172511). To begin, we must first establish the foundational principles that act as the gatekeepers of light within any optical system.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the analysis of any [optical imaging](@entry_id:169722) system, from a simple camera to a complex microscope, it is impractical and unnecessary to trace an infinite number of light rays. Instead, a powerful and efficient method involves identifying a few key rays whose paths through the system can reveal its primary performance characteristics. The most important of these are the **[chief ray](@entry_id:165818)** and the **marginal rays**. Understanding their definitions and roles is fundamental to the study of [geometrical optics](@entry_id:175509), as they govern the location, sharpness, brightness, and extent of an image. The behavior of these rays is dictated by a set of physical apertures within the system known as stops.

### Stops and Pupils: The Gatekeepers of Light

Every real optical system is composed of elements with finite physical size. The mounts holding lenses, the edges of the lenses themselves, and specially inserted diaphragms all act as apertures that obstruct light. Two of these apertures play particularly important roles in defining the system's performance.

The **[aperture stop](@entry_id:173170) (AS)** is the physical [aperture](@entry_id:172936) that most limits the cone of light rays originating from an on-axis object point that can pass through the entire system. In simple terms, it is the aperture that determines how much light the system collects from the object. In a single-lens system, the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170) is often the edge of the lens itself. In a multi-element system, identifying the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170) requires a more systematic approach.

To determine which element acts as the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170), one must view all potential apertures from the perspective of the on-axis object point. The image of each physical aperture, as formed by all optical elements that precede it, is called the **[entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) (EP)**. The [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) of the first element is simply the element itself, as there are no preceding optics. For any subsequent element, its [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) is its virtual or real image formed by the lenses in front of it. From the object's location, each [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) subtends a certain angle. The physical aperture whose [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) subtends the *smallest* angle is the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170) for the system.

For example, consider an imaging system with two thin lenses, L1 and L2, aligned on a common optical axis. Let L1 be a converging lens ($f_1 = 100$ mm, diameter $D_1 = 60$ mm) at $z_1 = 0$, and L2 be a [diverging lens](@entry_id:168382) ($f_2 = -150$ mm, diameter $D_2 = 12$ mm) at $z_2 = 50$ mm. For an on-axis object at $z_{obj} = -200$ mm, we can determine the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170) by comparing the entrance pupils of L1 and L2.

1.  **Entrance Pupil for L1**: As L1 is the first element, its [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) is L1 itself. Its diameter is $D_{e1} = D_1 = 60$ mm.

2.  **Entrance Pupil for L2**: We must find the image of L2's aperture as formed by L1. The [aperture](@entry_id:172936) of L2 is at $z=50$ mm. Using the [thin lens equation](@entry_id:172444) for L1, $\frac{1}{s'} = \frac{1}{f_1} - \frac{1}{s}$, with the object being L2, so its distance from L1 is $s = 50$ mm. The image location $s'$ is given by $\frac{1}{s'} = \frac{1}{100} - \frac{1}{50} = -\frac{1}{100}$, so $s' = -100$ mm. The magnification is $m = -s'/s = -(-100)/50 = 2$. The diameter of L2's [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) is therefore $D_{e2} = |m|D_2 = 2 \times 12 \text{ mm} = 24$ mm. This [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) is a [virtual image](@entry_id:175248) located at $z=-100$ mm.

To decide which is the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170), we compare the angles subtended by these pupils from the object at $z=-200$ mm. The angle for L1 is approximately $\alpha_1 \approx \frac{D_{e1}}{z_1 - z_{obj}} = \frac{60}{0 - (-200)} = 0.3$. The angle for L2's [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) is $\alpha_2 \approx \frac{D_{e2}}{s' - z_{obj}} = \frac{24}{-100 - (-200)} = 0.24$. Since $\alpha_2  \alpha_1$, the [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) of L2 limits the cone of rays more severely. Thus, L2 is the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170) of the system in this configuration. Note that this could change if the object position changes. [@problem_id:2259430]

Just as the [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) is the system's aperture as seen from the object, the **[exit pupil](@entry_id:167465) (ExP)** is the image of the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170) as formed by all optical elements that *follow* it. The [exit pupil](@entry_id:167465) represents the aperture through which light appears to emerge towards the image. All rays from an on-axis object point that pass through the system will also pass through the [exit pupil](@entry_id:167465). For this reason, the [exit pupil](@entry_id:167465) is the ideal location to place the [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) of a subsequent optical system, such as an observer's eye or a detector, to capture the maximum amount of light.

The location of the [exit pupil](@entry_id:167465) is found by applying standard imaging formulas. Consider a simple system with a converging lens of focal length $f$ and an [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170) placed a distance $f/3$ *in front* of it. To find the [exit pupil](@entry_id:167465), we treat the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170) as an object and find its image formed by the lens. The object distance is $s = f/3$. The [thin lens equation](@entry_id:172444) gives the image location $s'$: $\frac{1}{s'} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{s} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{f/3} = -\frac{2}{f}$. Thus, $s' = -f/2$. The negative sign indicates that the [exit pupil](@entry_id:167465) is a [virtual image](@entry_id:175248) located a distance $f/2$ in front of the lens, in object space. [@problem_id:2259442]

In a multi-lens system, the calculation is analogous. In a two-lens relay system where L1 ($f_1=150$ mm) is the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170) and is followed by L2 ($f_2=100$ mm) at a distance of $d=250$ mm, the [exit pupil](@entry_id:167465) is the image of L1 formed by L2. Treating L1 as the object for L2, the object distance is $s=d=250$ mm. The image distance $s'$ from L2 is given by $s' = \frac{f_2 s}{s - f_2} = \frac{100 \times 250}{250 - 100} \approx 167$ mm. The [exit pupil](@entry_id:167465) is a real image located 167 mm to the right of L2. Since there are no optics before L1, the [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) is simply L1 itself, located at L1. [@problem_id:2259475]

### Defining the Guiding Rays: Marginal and Chief Rays

Once the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170) is identified, we can unambiguously define the chief and marginal rays.

The **marginal rays** are the rays that originate from an object point (typically on-axis) and pass through the top and bottom edges (the "margin") of the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170). These two rays define the boundaries of the cone of light that the system accepts from that object point.

The **[chief ray](@entry_id:165818)** (also called the principal ray) is the ray that originates from an *off-axis* object point and passes through the center of the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170). This ray can be thought of as the central axis of the bundle of rays accepted from that off-axis point.

These rays are not physically distinct from any other rays but are powerful geometric constructs. The marginal rays tell us about the *amount* of light collected and the *sharpness* of the image, while the [chief ray](@entry_id:165818) tells us *where* in the image plane the light from an off-axis point will be centered.

### The Role of Marginal Rays: Brightness and Sharpness

The primary role of the marginal rays is to define the cone of light that forms an image point. The larger this cone—that is, the larger the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170)—the more light is collected, resulting in a brighter image. This is why telescopes have large objective lenses and camera lenses have adjustable apertures (f-stops).

Furthermore, the marginal rays are directly responsible for the phenomenon of defocus. When an image sensor is not placed at the exact focal plane, the cone of light from an object point is intercepted before or after it converges to a point. The result is a **blur circle**, or **[circle of confusion](@entry_id:166852)**, on the sensor. The diameter of this blur circle is determined by the marginal rays.

A [pinhole camera](@entry_id:172894) provides the most elementary illustration of this principle. Consider a [point source](@entry_id:196698) at height $h_o$ and distance $s_o$ from a pinhole of diameter $d$. The light projects onto a screen at a distance $L$ behind the pinhole. The rays from the source that pass through the top and bottom edges of the pinhole—the marginal rays for this system—define the size of the spot on the screen. By simple geometry (similar triangles), the total vertical size of this spot is found to be $H_{spot} = d(1 + L/s_o)$. This spot size is directly proportional to the aperture diameter $d$ and is independent of the object height $h_o$. The [chief ray](@entry_id:165818), passing from the object at $h_o$ through the center of the pinhole, determines the center of this spot, which is located at height $y_i = -h_o(L/s_o)$ on the screen. [@problem_id:2259461]

This concept extends directly to lens systems. Suppose a camera lens of focal length $f$ and diameter $D$ is focused for an object at a nominal distance $s_{o,nom}$, meaning the sensor is placed at the corresponding image plane $s_{i,nom}$. If the object moves slightly to a new distance $s_o = s_{o,nom} + \delta s_o$, the new focal plane shifts, but the sensor does not. The cone of light defined by the marginal rays now forms a blur circle on the fixed sensor. Using the [thin lens equation](@entry_id:172444) and the geometry of similar triangles formed by the converging marginal rays, the diameter of this blur circle can be shown to be $d_{blur} = \frac{D f \delta s_o}{(s_{o,nom}-f)(s_{o,nom}+\delta s_o)}$. This expression directly links the blur diameter $d_{blur}$ to the aperture diameter $D$ and the amount of defocus, quantified by $\delta s_o$. [@problem_id:2259440] A similar analysis applies if the screen is simply not placed at the correct image plane for a fixed object, resulting in a blur spot whose size depends on the lens radius and the distance from the true focus. [@problem_id:2259408]

The cone of light defined by the marginal rays is a critical consideration in system design. For instance, if one wishes to place an internal component, such as an anti-stray-light baffle, between an on-axis source and a lens, its radius must be small enough to not obstruct this cone. The maximum permissible radius of such a baffle is determined by tracing the [marginal ray](@entry_id:174766) from the source to the edge of the lens (the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170)) and finding the ray's height at the baffle's location. [@problem_id:2259465]

### The Role of the Chief Ray: Field of View

While marginal rays govern brightness and sharpness for a single image point, the [chief ray](@entry_id:165818) governs the overall extent of the scene that can be imaged—the **field of view (FOV)**. An optical system cannot form an acceptable image of an object point if the bundle of rays from it is largely blocked. The [chief ray](@entry_id:165818), being the central ray of such a bundle, serves as the primary indicator of whether an off-axis point is within the system's [field of view](@entry_id:175690).

The FOV is limited by an [aperture](@entry_id:172936) called the **[field stop](@entry_id:174952) (FS)**. The [field stop](@entry_id:174952) is the physical aperture that most restricts the passage of chief rays. In many systems, like cameras, the detector (e.g., a CCD or CMOS sensor) itself acts as the [field stop](@entry_id:174952). In other instruments, a dedicated diaphragm is placed at an intermediate image plane to sharply define the edge of the field.

Analogous to pupils, we can define "windows" associated with the [field stop](@entry_id:174952). The **entrance window** is the image of the [field stop](@entry_id:174952) as seen from object space (through preceding optics). It defines the extent of the object that can be imaged. The **exit window** is the image of the [field stop](@entry_id:174952) as seen from image space (through subsequent optics). It defines the size of the final image field.

Consider a two-lens system where L1 forms an intermediate image, and a diaphragm serving as the [field stop](@entry_id:174952) is placed at this intermediate image plane. Lens L2 then re-images this to form the final image. To find the location of the exit window, one simply calculates the image of the [field stop](@entry_id:174952) as formed by L2. For instance, if L1 ($f_1=20$ cm) forms an image of an object at 30 cm at a distance of 60 cm, and L2 ($f_2=15$ cm) is 70 cm from L1, the [field stop](@entry_id:174952) is 10 cm in front of L2. Treating the [field stop](@entry_id:174952) as an object for L2 ($s=10$ cm), the [thin lens equation](@entry_id:172444) gives its image position (the exit window location) as $s' = \frac{15 \times 10}{10 - 15} = -30$ cm. The exit window is a [virtual image](@entry_id:175248) 30 cm to the left of L2. [@problem_id:2259453]

### System-Level Effects: Vignetting and Fundamental Limits

The true power of the chief and [marginal ray](@entry_id:174766) concepts becomes apparent when analyzing system-level effects where multiple apertures interact. One of the most important of these effects is **[vignetting](@entry_id:174163)**. Vignetting is the progressive dimming of the image toward the edges of the [field of view](@entry_id:175690). It occurs when rays from an off-axis object point, even though they pass through the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170), are partially blocked by another [aperture](@entry_id:172936) in the system.

This is best understood by tracing the marginal rays for an *off-axis* object. For such an object, the [chief ray](@entry_id:165818) passes through the center of the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170), while the marginal rays pass through its top and bottom edges. The entire bundle of rays from this object point is tilted relative to the optical axis. As this tilted bundle propagates through the system, its edges may be clipped by the physical [aperture](@entry_id:172936) of another lens.

As an example, let's analyze a two-lens system where L1 ($f_1=20$ cm, $R_1=2.5$ cm) is the [aperture stop](@entry_id:173170), followed by L2 ($f_2=10$ cm, $R_2=2.0$ cm) at a distance $d=30$ cm. Consider a parallel beam from a distant source entering at an angle $\alpha = 2.0^\circ$. The two marginal rays for this off-axis object enter L1 at heights $y = R_1$ and $y = -R_1$. We can trace these rays through L1 and their subsequent propagation to the plane of L2. Calculations show that the ray entering at the bottom of L1 ($y=-R_1$) arrives at L2 with a height of approximately 2.30 cm, while the ray entering at the top ($y=R_1$) arrives at a height of -0.20 cm. The bundle of light at L2 thus extends from -0.20 cm to 2.30 cm. Since L2 has a radius of only 2.00 cm, the top portion of the beam, from 2.00 cm to 2.30 cm, is blocked. This clipping of the off-axis bundle results in [vignetting](@entry_id:174163). [@problem_id:2259441]

On a more fundamental level, the concepts of pupils and fields of view are tied together by a conservation law related to the **Lagrange invariant**, $H$. For any two rays propagating through a paraxial system, the quantity $H = n(\bar{u}y - u\bar{y})$ is an invariant, where $n$ is the refractive index, and $(y, u)$ and $(\bar{y}, \bar{u})$ are the height and angle of the two rays, respectively.

By choosing the two rays to be the on-axis [marginal ray](@entry_id:174766) and the [chief ray](@entry_id:165818) from the edge of the field of view, we can derive a profound relationship. Let's evaluate the invariant in object space (at the [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672), where $n=1$) and in image space. In object space, the [marginal ray](@entry_id:174766) has height $y = D_{EP}/2$ and angle $u=0$ (for an object at infinity), while the [chief ray](@entry_id:165818) has height $\bar{y}=0$ and angle $\bar{u}=\theta_{max}$. This gives $H = 1 \cdot (\theta_{max} \cdot D_{EP}/2 - 0 \cdot 0) = \frac{1}{2} D_{EP} \theta_{max}$. In image space ($n'$), the invariant becomes $H = n'(\bar{u}'y' - u'\bar{y}')$. At the final image plane, the [chief ray](@entry_id:165818) has height $\bar{y}'=y'_{max}$ and the [marginal ray](@entry_id:174766) has height $y'=0$, so $H = -n'u'y'_{max}$. The product of the pupil diameter and the [field of view](@entry_id:175690) is thus related to the product of the image size and the [numerical aperture](@entry_id:138876).

This relationship can be connected to the system's resolving power. If a system is designed to resolve $N$ points across its image diameter $2y'_{max}$, and its resolution is limited by diffraction according to the Rayleigh criterion, $\Delta L \approx 0.61 \lambda / NA'$, we can write $2y'_{max} = N \cdot \Delta L$. By substituting these relations into the Lagrange invariant, one can derive a fundamental limit for any optical system: the product of the [entrance pupil](@entry_id:163672) diameter and the full angular field of view is directly proportional to the number of resolvable points and the wavelength of light. Specifically, this relationship is approximately $D_{EP} \cdot (2\theta_{max}) \approx 1.22 N \lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the vacuum wavelength. This powerful result, sometimes called the "space-bandwidth product," demonstrates that for a given wavelength, one cannot arbitrarily increase both the field of view and the light-gathering/resolving power (related to $D_{EP}$); there is a fundamental trade-off governed by the desired information capacity ($N$) of the system.
