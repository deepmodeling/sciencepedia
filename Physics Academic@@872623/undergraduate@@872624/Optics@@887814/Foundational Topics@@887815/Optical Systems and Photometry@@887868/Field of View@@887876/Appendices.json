This corresponds to the size of the object that can be imaged onto the full diameter of the fiber optic bundle's input face. Let the diameter of the object be $h_o = D_{FoV}$ and the diameter of its image be $h_i$. For the entire field of view to be captured, the image must exactly fill the input face of the fiber optic bundle. Thus, the image diameter must be equal to the bundle's diameter, $h_i = D$.\n\nThe relationship between the object size and the image size is given by the lateral magnification, $M$. The magnitude of the magnification is defined as the ratio of the image height (or diameter) to the object height (or diameter):\n$$|M| = \\frac{h_i}{h_o}$$\nSubstituting our specific quantities, we have:\n$$|M| = \\frac{D}{D_{FoV}}$$\nTo find $D_{FoV}$, we can rearrange this equation:\n$$D_{FoV} = \\frac{D}{|M|}$$\nOur next task is to find an expression for the magnification, $M$.

This means the term $s_o - f$ is always positive. Therefore, $|s_o - f| = s_o - f$. The magnitude of the magnification is:\n$$|M| = \\frac{f}{s_o - f}$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $|M|$ into our equation for $D_{FoV}$:\n$$D_{FoV} = \\frac{D}{|M|} = \\frac{D}{\\frac{f}{s_o - f}}$$\n$$D_{FoV} = D \\frac{s_o - f}{f}$$\nThis expression can be written in a slightly different form by distributing the denominator:\n$$D_{FoV} = D \\left( \\frac{s_o}{f} - \\frac{f}{f} \\right) = D \\left( \\frac{s_o}{f} - 1 \\right)$$\nThis is the final expression for the diameter of the field of view.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D\\left(\\frac{s_o}{f} - 1\\right)}$$", "id": "2229251"}, {"introduction": "While simple systems may have a circular field of view, many advanced optical instruments exhibit different properties in different directions.
