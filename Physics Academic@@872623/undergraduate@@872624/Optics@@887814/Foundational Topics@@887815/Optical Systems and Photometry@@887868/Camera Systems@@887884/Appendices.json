This first exercise takes us into the world of macro photography, where the goal is to capture tiny subjects at life-size ($1:1$) magnification. In this practice [@problem_id:2221413], you will see how to apply these core optical equations to determine the physical adjustments needed for a lens, including the use of an extension tube to push the system beyond its normal focusing range.", "problem": "A photographer wants to achieve 1:1 lifesize macro photography using a prime lens that can be modeled as a single thin lens with a focal length of $f = 50.0$ mm. The lens's internal focusing mechanism allows the distance from its optical center to the camera's sensor, $d_i$, to be adjusted. The minimum possible lens-to-sensor distance is equal to the focal length, $d_{i, \\text{min}} = f$, which is achieved when focusing on an object at infinity. The maximum lens-to-sensor distance achievable with the lens's own focusing system is $d_{i, \\text{max}} = 65.0$ mm.\n\nTo achieve 1:1 lifesize imaging, which corresponds to a transverse magnification of $M = -1.00$, the photographer must use an extension tube. This is a simple hollow cylinder that is inserted between the camera body and the lens, acting as a spacer to increase the lens-to-sensor distance. To use the shortest possible extension tube, the photographer will set the lens's own focus to its closest setting (achieving $d_{i, \\text{max}}$).\n\nCalculate the minimum required length, $L$, of the extension tube that will allow the photographer to achieve the desired 1:1 magnification.
