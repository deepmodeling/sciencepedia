We can solve this by combining the formula for angular magnification with the lensmaker's equation.\n\nFirst, let's determine the required focal length, $f$, of the lens. The angular magnification, $M$, of a simple magnifier for a relaxed eye (where the final image is at infinity) is given by the ratio of the user's near point distance, $N$, to the focal length of the lens, $f$.\n$$M = \\frac{N}{f}$$\nWe are given $M = 6.5$ and $N = 30.0$ cm. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the focal length $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{N}{M}$$\nSubstituting the given values, we find the required focal length:\n$$f = \\frac{30.0 \\text{ cm}}{6.5}$$\n\nNext, we relate the focal length of the lens to its physical properties using the lensmaker's equation. For a thin lens, this equation is:\n$$\\frac{1}{f} = \\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{lens}}}{n_{\\text{medium}}} - 1\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2}\\right)$$\nHere, $n_{\\text{lens}}$ is the refractive index of the lens material, $n_{\\text{medium}}$ is the refractive index of the surrounding medium, and $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces.\n\nIn our case, the lens is made of a ceramic with $n_{\\text{lens}} = n = 1.75$ and is used in air, so $n_{\\text{medium}} = 1.00$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2}\\right)$$\nThe lens is plano-convex. This means one surface is planar (flat) and the other is convex. A planar surface has an infinite radius of curvature. Let's set the first surface to be planar, so $R_1 \\to \\infty$. The second surface is convex with a radius of curvature whose magnitude is $R$. According to the sign convention where light travels from left to right, if the second surface is convex (bulging towards the right), its center of curvature is to the left, so $R_2 = -R$. Substituting these into the lensmaker's equation gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\infty} - \\frac{1}{-R}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left(0 + \\frac{1}{R}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{n - 1}{R}$$\nNote that if we had chosen the convex surface to be the first one ($R_1 = R$) and the planar surface to be the second one ($R_2 \\to \\infty$), the result for $\\frac{1}{f}$ would be the same. The equation relates the focal length to the magnitude of the radius of curvature of the convex surface, $R$.\n\nNow we have two expressions for $\\frac{1}{f}$. From the magnification formula, $\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{M}{N}$. From the lensmaker's equation, $\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{n-1}{R}$. We can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n$$\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{n - 1}{R}$$\nWe need to solve for the magnitude of the radius of curvature, $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{N(n - 1)}{M}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$N = 30.0$ cm\n$n = 1.75$\n$M = 6.5$\n\n$$R = \\frac{(30.0 \\text{ cm})(1.75 - 1.00)}{6.5}$$\n$$R = \\frac{(30.0 \\text{ cm})(0.75)}{6.5}$$\n$$R = \\frac{22.5 \\text{ cm}}{6.5}$$\n$$R \\approx 3.461538... \\text{ cm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 3.46 \\text{ cm}$$\nTherefore, the required magnitude of the radius of curvature for the convex surface of the lens is 3.46 cm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.46}$$", "id": "2270159"}, {"introduction": "Lenses are often specified by their power in diopters ($P$) rather than their focal length.
