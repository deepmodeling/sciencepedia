The student sets up a coordinate system where the optical axis is the $z$-axis, and the input face of the instrument corresponds to the plane $z=0$. The region $z>0$ is inside the instrument. The student has access to a movable point source of light, a large area detector that measures total transmitted power, and a ruler for making position measurements.\n\nTo characterize the instrument's light-gathering properties, the student performs two experiments.\n\n**Experiment 1:**\nThe student places the point source at various axial distances, $-z_s$ (where $z_s>0$), from the input face. At each position $z_s$, they move the source transversely away from the optical axis to a position $x_{\\text{max}}$. This $x_{\\text{max}}$ is defined as the maximum transverse displacement for which the detector, placed at the output, registers a non-zero signal. For any displacement $|x| > x_{\\text{max}}$, the signal is zero. The following data were recorded (all distances in cm):\n\n| Axial Distance $z_s$ (cm) | Maximum Transverse Displacement $x_{max}$ (cm) |\n|:--------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------:|\n|           10.0             |                      3.0                          |\n|           20.0             |                      5.0                          |\n|           30.0             |                      7.0                          |\n|           40.0             |                      9.0                          |\n\n**Experiment 2:**\nThe student moves the point source to a very large distance from the instrument along the optical axis, so the light entering the instrument is effectively a collimated beam parallel to the axis. They then use the straight edge of the ruler as a knife-edge, sliding it across the input face of the instrument in the transverse ($x$) direction. They record the position of the ruler's edge, $x_{pos}$, and the corresponding power reading on the detector. They observe that the detector reading is constant for $x_{pos}  -12.5$ mm, drops to zero for $x_{pos} > 12.5$ mm, and decreases smoothly between these two positions.\n\nBased on these two experiments, determine the axial location of the instrument's entrance pupil relative to the input face, and the diameter of the entrance pupil.

The data describe a linear relationship between the source's axial distance ($z_s$) and its maximum transverse displacement ($x_{\\text{max}}$). This corresponds to a model where the field of view is limited by a maximum chief ray angle. A chief ray is a ray from an off-axis object point that passes through the center of the entrance pupil. If we assume the field is limited by a constant maximum chief ray angle $\\alpha$, then for a source at the edge of the field, $(x_{\\text{max}}, -z_s)$, the geometry is:\n$$\n\\tan(\\alpha)=\\frac{x_{\\text{max}}}{z_{s} + z_{e}}\n$$\nRearranging this gives a linear equation for $x_{\\text{max}}$ as a function of $z_s$:\n$$\nx_{\\text{max}} = (\\tan\\alpha)z_s + (\\tan\\alpha)z_e\n$$\nThis matches the form $y = mx + c$, where the slope is $m = \\tan\\alpha$ and the y-intercept is $c = (\\tan\\alpha)z_e$.\nFrom the provided data, we can calculate the slope:\n$$\nm = \\frac{\\Delta x_{\\text{max}}}{\\Delta z_s} = \\frac{5.0\\ \\text{cm} - 3.0\\ \\text{cm}}{20.0\\ \\text{cm} - 10.0\\ \\text{cm}} = \\frac{2.0}{10.0} = 0.2\n$$\nChecking with another pair confirms the slope is constant. So, $\\tan\\alpha = 0.2$.\nNow we can find the intercept $c$ by substituting one of the data points into $x_{\\text{max}} = 0.2 z_s + c$:\n$$\n3.0 = (0.2)(10.0) + c \\implies c = 3.0 - 2.0 = 1.0\\ \\text{cm}\n$$\nFrom our model, we know $c = (\\tan\\alpha)z_e$. We can now solve for the pupil location $z_e$:\n$$\nz_e = \\frac{c}{\\tan\\alpha} = \\frac{1.0\\ \\text{cm}}{0.2} = 5.0\\ \\text{cm}\n$$\nThe entrance pupil is located 5.0 cm inside the instrument.\n\n**Analysis of Experiment 2:**\nThis experiment determines the entrance pupil diameter. A collimated on-axis beam consists of rays parallel to the optical axis. These rays effectively project the entrance pupil's aperture orthographically onto the input face at $z=0$. When the knife-edge is slid across the input face, it begins to block light when it reaches the edge of this projected circle and completely blocks light when it passes the opposite edge. The data shows the signal transition occurs between $x_{pos} = -12.5$ mm and $x_{pos} = +12.5$ mm. This means the radius of the entrance pupil is $12.5$ mm.\nThe diameter of the entrance pupil is therefore $D = 2 \\times 12.5\\ \\text{mm} = 25.0$ mm.\n            \n**Conclusion:**\nThe entrance pupil is located $5.00$ cm inside the instrument (at $z = +5.00$ cm) and its diameter is $25.0$ mm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{Location} = 5.00 \\text{ cm}, \\text{Diameter} = 25.0 \\text{ mm}}$$", "id": "2218504"}]}
