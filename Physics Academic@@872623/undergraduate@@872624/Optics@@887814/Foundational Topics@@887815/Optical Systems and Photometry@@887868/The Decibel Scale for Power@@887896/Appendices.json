This first exercise provides a direct application of the defining formula for decibel attenuation, which conventionally yields a positive value for a component that reduces power. This is a common calculation in any optics lab when characterizing components like filters. By working through this problem, you will solidify your grasp on the basic mathematical relationship that underpins all decibel-based measurements.

A laser beam with a constant initial power, $P_{in}$, is directed perpendicularly onto the filter. A power meter placed immediately after the filter measures the transmitted power, $P_{out}$.\n\nThe experimental measurement shows that the transmitted power is precisely 1.00% of the incident power.\n\nIn optics and telecommunications, the attenuation of a component is commonly expressed in decibels (dB). It is defined using the ratio of the input power to the output power, which ensures that attenuating components have a positive dB value.

The attenuator is rated for a loss of 12 dB.\n\nFor quick field calculations, engineers often use the approximation that a 3 dB loss corresponds to a reduction in signal power by a factor of 2.
