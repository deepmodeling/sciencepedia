At the opposite edge, they are separated by a very thin shim, forming a narrow wedge-shaped film of a transparent material between them. The material filling the wedge has a uniform refractive index $n$. The angle of the wedge, which is very small, is denoted by $\\alpha$, expressed in radians.\n\nThe setup is illuminated from above with monochromatic light of vacuum wavelength $\\lambda_0$, incident nearly perpendicularly to the top plate. An observer looking down at the setup sees a series of parallel dark and bright interference fringes running parallel to the line of contact.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the spatial density of the dark fringes. This density is defined as the number of dark fringes observed per unit length when measuring horizontally from the line of contact outwards along the wedge.", "solution": "The phenomenon observed is thin-film interference. The dark and bright fringes arise from the superposition of two light waves: one that reflects from the top surface of the film (the bottom surface of the upper glass plate) and another that reflects from the bottom surface of the film (the top surface of the lower glass plate).\n\nLet's analyze the path difference and phase shifts for a light ray incident nearly normally on the setup. Let $x$ be the horizontal distance from the line of contact where the two plates touch. For a small wedge angle $\\alpha$, the thickness of the film $t$ at this position can be approximated as:\n$$t \\approx x \\tan(\\alpha)$$\nSince $\\alpha$ is very small, we can use the small-angle approximation $\\tan(\\alpha) \\approx \\alpha$ (where $\\alpha$ is in radians). Thus, the thickness of the film is:\n$$t = x\\alpha$$\n\nThe first reflected wave is from the upper surface of the film. This reflection occurs at the interface between the top glass plate (higher refractive index) and the film (lower refractive index, $n$). Since the light travels from a medium of higher refractive index to one of lower refractive index, there is no phase shift upon this reflection.\n\nThe second reflected wave travels through the film, reflects from the bottom surface, and travels back up through the film. The reflection occurs at the interface between the film (refractive index $n$) and the bottom glass plate (higher refractive index). Since light is reflecting from a medium of lower refractive index off a medium of higher refractive index, this reflection introduces a phase shift of $\\pi$ radians. This is equivalent to an additional path length of $\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light within the film.\n\nThe geometric path difference for the second wave compared to the first is twice the thickness of the film, $2t$. The wavelength of the light inside the film is $\\lambda = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{n}$.\n\nDestructive interference (a dark fringe) occurs when the total effective path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength in the film. The total effective path difference is the sum of the geometric path difference and the path difference equivalent to the phase shift. However, a more direct way is to consider the phase.
