The setup consists of a laser source, a beam splitter, a reference mirror, and a test mirror. A sealed gas cell of length $L$ is placed in the path of the beam traveling towards the test mirror. The light from the laser has a vacuum wavelength of $\\lambda$.\n\nInitially, the gas cell is evacuated to a near-perfect vacuum, where its refractive index is $n_{\\text{initial}} = 1$. The interferometer is aligned such that the detector observes a uniform field of constructive interference. A specific type of gas is then slowly introduced into the cell until it reaches a stable pressure. This process causes the refractive index of the medium inside the cell to increase by an amount $\\Delta n$. This change in the optical path length of the test arm causes a series of interference fringes to sweep across the detector.\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n- Length of the gas cell, $L = 20.0 \\text{ cm}$.\n- Vacuum wavelength of the laser, $\\lambda = 500 \\text{ nm}$.\n- Change in the refractive index of the gas, $\\Delta n = 4.00 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\nCalculate the total number of bright fringes that move past a stationary point at the center of the detector.
