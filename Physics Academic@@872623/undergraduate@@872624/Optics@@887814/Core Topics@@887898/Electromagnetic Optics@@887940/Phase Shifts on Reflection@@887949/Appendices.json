The phase shift depends on the relative values of the refractive indices of the medium of incidence and the medium of transmission.\n\nThe general rule for the phase shift upon reflection is as follows:\n1.  If a light wave traveling in a medium with refractive index $n_a$ reflects off the surface of a medium with a higher refractive index $n_b$ (i.e., $n_b  n_a$), the reflected wave undergoes a phase shift of $\\pi$ radians ($180^\\circ$).

If a light wave traveling in a medium with refractive index $n_a$ reflects off the surface of a medium with a lower refractive index $n_b$ (i.e., $n_b  n_a$), the reflected wave undergoes no phase shift, which is a phase shift of $0$ radians.
