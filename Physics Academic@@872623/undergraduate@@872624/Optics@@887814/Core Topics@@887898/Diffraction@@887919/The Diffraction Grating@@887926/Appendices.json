In a real grating, the pattern is a product of interference between all slits and diffraction from each individual slit. This exercise [@problem_id:2225819] explores the fascinating phenomenon of \"missing orders,\" where a principal maximum predicted by the interference condition is completely suppressed because it coincides with a minimum of the single-slit diffraction pattern. Understanding this is key to interpreting the complex intensity distributions observed in real-world experiments.", "problem": "In the design of a custom diffraction grating for an optical spectrometer, a specific manufacturing process imposes a strict geometric constraint on the grating's structure. The distance between the centers of any two adjacent transparent slits, denoted by $d$, is precisely three times the width of a single slit, denoted by $a$. When monochromatic light is incident normally on this grating, the resulting diffraction pattern is a combination of multi-slit interference and single-slit diffraction. The single-slit diffraction envelope suppresses certain interference maxima. These are known as \"missing orders\". Determine the smallest non-zero integer order, $m$, of the principal interference maximum that is completely suppressed and thus absent from the final observed pattern.", "solution": "For a transmission diffraction grating with normal incidence, the principal interference maxima occur at angles satisfying the grating condition\n$$\nd \\sin\\theta = m \\lambda,\n$$\nwhere $d$ is the slit separation, $m$ is a nonzero integer order, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength. The single-slit diffraction envelope has minima at angles where\n$$\na \\sin\\theta = p \\lambda,\n$$\nwith $a$ the slit width and $p$ a nonzero integer. A \"missing order\" occurs when a principal interference maximum coincides with a single-slit minimum, i.e., when both conditions hold for the same angle.
