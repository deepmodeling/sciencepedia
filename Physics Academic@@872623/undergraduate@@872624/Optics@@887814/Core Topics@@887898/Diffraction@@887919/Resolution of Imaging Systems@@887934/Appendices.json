The camera consists of a light-proof box of length $L$, with a small circular aperture (the pinhole) of diameter $D$ at one end and a photosensitive screen at the other. The camera is intended to image a very distant point source of light, which emits light at a characteristic wavelength $\\lambda$.\n\nDue to physical optics, the image of the point source on the screen is not a perfect point but a blurred spot.
