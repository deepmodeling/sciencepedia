An opaque screen is placed at $x=0$, containing a long narrow slit of width $w$ centered on the origin and also parallel to the $y$-axis. The light passing through the slit is observed at a point $P$ on the optical axis, located at $(x=d_2, y=0, z=0)$.\n\nDue to the geometry, it is useful to define linear Fresnel zones on the plane of the slit. These zones are rectangular strips parallel to the $y$-axis. The boundaries of these zones are defined by the condition that the total path length from the line source, to a point $(0, 0, z)$ on the slit, and then to the observation point $P$, differs from the direct axial path length by an integer multiple of a half-wavelength. The direct axial path length is the distance from the source to the center of the slit $(0,0,0)$ and then to the point $P$.\n\nLet $z_n$ be the distance from the optical axis (the $x$-axis) to the outer boundary of the $n$-th linear Fresnel zone in the positive $z$ direction.
