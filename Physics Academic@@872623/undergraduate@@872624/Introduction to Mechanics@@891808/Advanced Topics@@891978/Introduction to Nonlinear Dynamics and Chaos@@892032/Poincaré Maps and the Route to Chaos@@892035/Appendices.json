A fixed point represents an equilibrium state where the system remains unchanged over time.

When the state variable converges to a specific value after many iterations, this value is known as a stable fixed point of the map.\n\nA fixed point, let's call it $x^*$, of an iterative map $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$ is a value that remains unchanged by the map. In other words, if the system reaches the state $x^*$, it will stay there for all future steps. Mathematically, a fixed point satisfies the equation:\n$$x^* = f(x^*)$$\nFor the given map, $f(x) = \\cos(x)$, so the fixed point equation is:\n$$x^* = \\cos(x^*)$$\nThis is a transcendental equation, which means it cannot be solved for $x^*$ using a finite sequence of algebraic operations or elementary functions. However, we can find the numerical value of the fixed point by performing the iteration as described in the problem and observing the value to which the sequence $x_n$ converges.\n\nWe start with the initial condition $x_0 = 1$.

This limit is the numerical solution to $x = \\cos(x)$, sometimes known as the Dottie number.\nLet's check the value around which the sequence is oscillating:\nLet's test the value $x \\approx 0.739085$.\n$\\cos(0.739085) \\approx 0.73908513...$\nThis confirms that the sequence converges to this value.\n\nThe problem asks for the result rounded to four significant figures.
