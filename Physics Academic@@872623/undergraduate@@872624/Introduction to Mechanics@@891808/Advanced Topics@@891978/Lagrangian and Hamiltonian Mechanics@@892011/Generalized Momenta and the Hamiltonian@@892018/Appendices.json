An elevator car of mass $m_1$ is connected to a counterweight of mass $m_2$ by a light, inextensible string that passes over a solid uniform cylindrical pulley. The pulley has mass $M$ and radius $R$, and it rotates about its central axis without friction. The string does not slip on the pulley. Let the system be described by a single generalized coordinate, $x$, which represents the downward vertical displacement of the elevator car from its initial position. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n\nDetermine the Hamiltonian of the system, $H$, expressed as a function of the generalized coordinate $x$ and its corresponding conjugate momentum, $p_x$.", "solution": "The goal is to find the Hamiltonian $H(x, p_x)$ of the system. The procedure involves finding the Lagrangian $L$, calculating the generalized momentum $p_x$, and then performing a Legendre transformation to obtain the Hamiltonian.\n\nFirst, we express the kinetic energy ($T$) and potential energy ($V$) of the system in terms of the generalized coordinate $x$ and its time derivative $\\dot{x}$.\n\nThe velocity of the elevator car (mass $m_1$) is $v_1 = \\dot{x}$, as its downward displacement is $x$.\nSince the string is inextensible, the counterweight (mass $m_2$) must move upward with the same speed.
