A light vertical spring with spring constant $k$ and natural length $l_0$ connects the hinge to the point on the horizontal plane located symmetrically between the two sliding ends. Let $g$ be the acceleration due to gravity. The system is allowed to settle into a stable equilibrium configuration where the rods are not vertical. Determine the expression for the cosine of the angle, $\\theta$, that each rod makes with the vertical in this equilibrium state. Your answer should be in terms of $M, g, L, k,$ and $l_0$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the principle of virtual work, which states that a system is in equilibrium when its total potential energy is at an extremum. We can find the equilibrium angle $\\theta$ by expressing the total potential energy $U$ of the system as a function of $\\theta$ and then finding the value of $\\theta$ for which the derivative of the potential energy with respect to $\\theta$ is zero, i.e., $\\frac{dU}{d\\theta} = 0$.\n\nLet's establish a coordinate system. Let the origin $(0,0)$ be on the horizontal plane at the point where the bottom of the vertical spring is attached. The vertical direction is along the y-axis. The angle $\\theta$ is defined as the angle each rod makes with the vertical (the y-axis).\n\nThe total potential energy $U$ of the system is the sum of the gravitational potential energy of the two rods, $U_g$, and the potential energy stored in the spring, $U_s$.\n$$U(\\theta) = U_g(\\theta) + U_s(\\theta)$$\n\nFirst, let's find the gravitational potential energy, $U_g$. The center of mass of a uniform rod of length $L$ is at its midpoint. The height of the hinge above the horizontal plane is $y_{hinge} = L \\cos\\theta$. The center of mass of each rod is at half this height relative to the hinge, along the rod. Thus, the height of the center of mass of each rod above the plane is $y_{cm} = \\frac{1}{2} L \\cos\\theta$. Since there are two identical rods, each of mass $M$, the total gravitational potential energy is:\n$$U_g(\\theta) = 2 \\times (M g y_{cm}) = 2 M g \\left(\\frac{1}{2} L \\cos\\theta\\right) = M g L \\cos\\theta$$\n\nNext, we find the spring potential energy, $U_s$. The spring connects the hinge to the origin. The length of the spring is therefore equal to the height of the hinge, which is $l_{spring} = y_{hinge} = L \\cos\\theta$. The potential energy stored in a spring is given by $U_s = \\frac{1}{2} k (\\text{current length} - \\text{natural length})^2$. The natural length is given as $l_0$. So, the spring potential energy is:\n$$U_s(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k (L \\cos\\theta - l_0)^2$$\n\nNow, we can write the total potential energy of the system as a function of $\\theta$:\n$$U(\\theta) = M g L \\cos\\theta + \\frac{1}{2} k (L \\cos\\theta - l_0)^2$$\n\nFor the system to be in equilibrium, the derivative of the total potential energy with respect to the generalized coordinate $\\theta$ must be zero:\n$$\\frac{dU}{d\\theta} = 0$$\nLet's compute this derivative using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{dU}{d\\theta} = \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left[ M g L \\cos\\theta + \\frac{1}{2} k (L \\cos\\theta - l_0)^2 \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dU}{d\\theta} = M g L (-\\sin\\theta) + \\frac{1}{2} k \\cdot 2 (L \\cos\\theta - l_0) \\cdot \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(L \\cos\\theta - l_0)$$\n$$\\frac{dU}{d\\theta} = -M g L \\sin\\theta + k (L \\cos\\theta - l_0) (-L \\sin\\theta)$$\n\nSetting the derivative to zero for equilibrium:\n$$-M g L \\sin\\theta - k L \\sin\\theta (L \\cos\\theta - l_0) = 0$$\nWe can factor out $-L \\sin\\theta$:\n$$-L \\sin\\theta [M g + k(L \\cos\\theta - l_0)] = 0$$\nThis equation gives two possible conditions for equilibrium:\n1.  $\\sin\\theta = 0$, which implies $\\theta = 0$. This corresponds to the vertical configuration where the two rods are standing straight up.\n2.  $M g + k(L \\cos\\theta - l_0) = 0$. This corresponds to a non-vertical equilibrium.\n\nThe problem asks for the stable, non-vertical equilibrium configuration. We therefore proceed with the second condition:\n$$M g + k(L \\cos\\theta - l_0) = 0$$\nNow, we solve for $\\cos\\theta$:\n$$k(L \\cos\\theta - l_0) = -M g$$\n$$L \\cos\\theta - l_0 = -\\frac{M g}{k}$$\n$$L \\cos\\theta = l_0 - \\frac{M g}{k}$$\n$$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{l_0}{L} - \\frac{M g}{k L}$$\nCombining the terms on the right-hand side into a single fraction gives the final expression:\n$$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{k l_0 - M g}{k L}$$\nThis expression is valid for a physically realizable non-vertical equilibrium, which requires $0 \\leq \\cos\\theta  1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{k l_{0} - M g}{k L}}$$", "id": "2223278"}, {"introduction": "The power of the potential energy method truly shines when dealing with systems constrained to move along a specific path.
