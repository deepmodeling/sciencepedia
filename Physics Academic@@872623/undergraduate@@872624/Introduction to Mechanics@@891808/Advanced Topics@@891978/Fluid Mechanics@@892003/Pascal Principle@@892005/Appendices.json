By analyzing the small oscillations of a mass on a piston [@problem_id:2206256], you will apply the principles of simple harmonic motion to a fluid context. This problem requires you to derive an effective spring constant and an effective mass for the system, demonstrating the deep connection between fluid mechanics and mechanical vibrations.", "problem": "A frictionless hydraulic lift is constructed from two vertical cylindrical chambers, with cross-sectional areas $A_1$ and $A_2$, connected by a narrow horizontal tube. The chambers are sealed by two frictionless pistons of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively. The entire system is filled with an incompressible fluid of density $\\rho$. A block of mass $M$ is placed on top of the second piston (with area $A_2$). The system is allowed to come to static equilibrium under gravity, with the acceleration due to gravity being $g$.\n\nThe block on the output piston is then given a small vertical displacement from its equilibrium position and released, after which it is observed to oscillate with simple harmonic motion. Assuming that the mass and kinetic energy of the fluid can be neglected, determine the frequency of this oscillation. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $M$, $m_1$, $m_2$, $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\rho$, and $g$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the frequency of simple harmonic motion (SHM) of a mass on a hydraulic lift. The frequency $f$ of SHM is given by the formula $f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff}}{m_{eff}}}$, where $k_{eff}$ is the effective spring constant of the system and $m_{eff}$ is its effective oscillating mass. Our goal is to derive expressions for both $k_{eff}$ and $m_{eff}$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the effective spring constant $k_{eff}$. The restoring force in this system arises from the change in hydrostatic pressure due to the displacement from equilibrium. Let's define a downward displacement of the output piston (piston 2) from its equilibrium position as $y$. Since the hydraulic fluid is incompressible, the volume of fluid displaced by piston 2 must be equal to the volume that displaces piston 1. Let the upward displacement of the input piston (piston 1) be $y_1$. Then, we have the continuity relation:\n$$A_2 y = A_1 y_1 \\implies y_1 = y \\frac{A_2}{A_1}$$\nThe total change in height difference between the fluid levels in the two chambers is $y_{total} = y + y_1$. Substituting the expression for $y_1$:\n$$y_{total} = y + y \\frac{A_2}{A_1} = y \\left(1 + \\frac{A_2}{A_1}\\right)$$\nThis height difference creates an additional hydrostatic pressure difference $\\Delta P$ in the fluid, which provides the restoring force. The pressure at the level of the lower piston (piston 2) is now higher than it would be if only considering the piston weights, by an amount:\n$$\\Delta P = \\rho g y_{total} = \\rho g y \\left(1 + \\frac{A_2}{A_1}\\right)$$\nThis excess pressure $\\Delta P$ acts on the entire fluid. The restoring force on the system can be thought of as the force required to hold the system in this displaced state. Let's find the external force $F_{ext}$ needed to hold piston 2 down by a displacement $y$. This external force must balance the net upward pressure force created by the displacement. The pressure $\\Delta P$ creates an upward force $F_{restore,1}$ on piston 1 and $F_{restore,2}$ on piston 2. However, a simpler way to calculate the effective spring constant is to relate the restoring force to the displacement $y$. An upward restoring force $F_{restore}$ acts on the system, trying to return it to equilibrium. This force is due to the hydrostatic pressure imbalance. The magnitude of this force, referred to the displacement of piston 2, is the excess pressure multiplied by area $A_2$, but we must also account for the force on piston 1.\n\nLet's use a more rigorous force balance method. Let $F_{ext}$ be an external downward force applied to piston 2 to hold it at a displacement $y$ below equilibrium. The restoring force will have the same magnitude, $F_{restore} = F_{ext}$. In this new static state, the upward force on piston 2, $P_2 A_2$, balances the gravitational forces and $F_{ext}$. The upward force on piston 1, $P_1 A_1$, balances its weight. So, $P_1 A_1 = m_1 g$. The pressures at the piston faces, $P_1$ and $P_2$, are related by the hydrostatic pressure difference: $P_2 = P_1 + \\rho g (h_1 - h_2)$, where $h_1$ and $h_2$ are the fluid levels.\nAt equilibrium ($y=0, F_{ext}=0$): $\\frac{(m_2+M)g}{A_2} = \\frac{m_1g}{A_1} + \\rho g(h_{1,eq}-h_{2,eq})$.\nWhen displaced by $y$ (downward for piston 2): $h_2 = h_{2,eq} - y$ and $h_1 = h_{1,eq} + y_1 = h_{1,eq} + y\\frac{A_2}{A_1}$.\nThe new force balance on piston 2 is: $P_2 A_2 = (m_2+M)g + F_{ext}$.\nSubstituting $P_2$: $\\left(\\frac{m_1g}{A_1} + \\rho g (h_1-h_2)\\right)A_2 = (m_2+M)g + F_{ext}$.\n$$ \\frac{m_1g A_2}{A_1} + \\rho g A_2 \\left( (h_{1,eq}-h_{2,eq}) + y\\left(1+\\frac{A_2}{A_1}\\right) \\right) = (m_2+M)g + F_{ext}$$\nUsing the equilibrium equation to substitute for $\\rho g(h_{1,eq}-h_{2,eq})$:\n$$ \\frac{m_1g A_2}{A_1} + A_2 \\left( \\frac{(m_2+M)g}{A_2} - \\frac{m_1g}{A_1} \\right) + \\rho g A_2 y \\left(1+\\frac{A_2}{A_1}\\right) = (m_2+M)g + F_{ext}$$\nSimplifying the left side gives:\n$$ (m_2+M)g + \\rho g y (A_2 + \\frac{A_2^2}{A_1}) = (m_2+M)g + F_{ext}$$\nThus, $F_{ext} = \\rho g y (A_2 + \\frac{A_2^2}{A_1})$.\nThe restoring force is $F_{restore} = -F_{ext} = - \\left[ \\rho g \\left(A_2 + \\frac{A_2^2}{A_1}\\right) \\right] y$.\nThis is in the form $F_{restore} = -k_{eff} y$, so the effective spring constant is:\n$$k_{eff} = \\rho g \\left(A_2 + \\frac{A_2^2}{A_1}\\right) = \\rho g \\frac{A_1 A_2 + A_2^2}{A_1} = \\frac{\\rho g A_2 (A_1 + A_2)}{A_1}$$\n\nNext, we determine the effective mass $m_{eff}$ of the oscillating system. We write the total kinetic energy of the moving parts in terms of the velocity of the output piston, $\\dot{y}$. The mass on piston 2 is $M+m_2$, and its velocity is $\\dot{y}$. The mass of piston 1 is $m_1$, and its velocity is $\\dot{y_1} = \\dot{y} \\frac{A_2}{A_1}$.\nThe total kinetic energy $T$ is:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2}(M+m_2)\\dot{y}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_1 \\dot{y_1}^2$$\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2}(M+m_2)\\dot{y}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_1 \\left(\\dot{y} \\frac{A_2}{A_1}\\right)^2$$\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (M+m_2) + m_1 \\frac{A_2^2}{A_1^2} \\right) \\dot{y}^2$$\nThe kinetic energy is also given by $T = \\frac{1}{2}m_{eff}\\dot{y}^2$. Comparing the two expressions, we identify the effective mass as:\n$$m_{eff} = (M+m_2) + m_1 \\left(\\frac{A_2}{A_1}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(M+m_2)A_1^2 + m_1 A_2^2}{A_1^2}$$\n\nNow we can compute the frequency $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff}}{m_{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\frac{\\rho g A_2 (A_1 + A_2)}{A_1} }{ \\frac{(M+m_2)A_1^2 + m_1 A_2^2}{A_1^2} } }$$\n$$f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\rho g A_2 (A_1 + A_2)}{A_1} \\cdot \\frac{A_1^2}{(M+m_2)A_1^2 + m_1 A_2^2} }$$\n$$f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\rho g A_1 A_2 (A_1 + A_2)}{(M+m_2)A_1^2 + m_1 A_2^2} }$$\n\nThis is the final expression for the frequency of oscillation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\rho g A_1 A_2 (A_1 + A_2)}{(M+m_2)A_1^2 + m_1 A_2^2} }}$$", "id": "2206256"}]}
