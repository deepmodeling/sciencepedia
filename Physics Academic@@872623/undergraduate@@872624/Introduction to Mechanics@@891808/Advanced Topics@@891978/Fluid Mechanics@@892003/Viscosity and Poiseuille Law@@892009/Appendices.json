The key information is that the block moves at a constant speed, $v$. According to Newton's First Law, if an object moves with a constant velocity, the net force acting on it must be zero. We will apply this principle to both the block on the horizontal surface and the hanging mass.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the forces acting on the hanging mass, $M_2$. There are two vertical forces: the gravitational force, $F_{g2} = M_2 g$, acting downwards, and the tension in the string, $T$, acting upwards. Since the mass $M_2$ moves at a constant speed, its acceleration is zero. Therefore, the net force on it is zero.\n$$ \\sum F_y = T - M_2 g = 0 $$\nFrom this, we can determine the tension in the string:\n$$ T = M_2 g $$\n\nNext, we analyze the forces acting on the block of mass $M_1$ moving on the horizontal surface. The vertical forces on this block are its weight, $M_1 g$, and the normal force from the surface. These forces are balanced and do not affect the horizontal motion. The horizontal forces are the tension from the string, $T$, pulling the block forward, and the viscous drag force, $F_v$, from the lubricant, opposing the motion. Since the block moves at a constant speed $v$, its acceleration is zero, and the net horizontal force on it is also zero.\n$$ \\sum F_x = T - F_v = 0 $$\nThis implies that the tension is equal in magnitude to the viscous drag force:\n$$ T = F_v $$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for the tension $T$, we find that the viscous drag force is equal to the weight of the hanging mass:\n$$ F_v = M_2 g $$\n\nThe problem states that the velocity profile in the oil film is linear. For such a case, the viscous drag force is given by the formula:\n$$ F_v = \\eta A \\frac{v}{h} $$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity, $A$ is the contact area of the block with the fluid, $v$ is the relative speed of the block with respect to the surface, and $h$ is the thickness of the fluid film.\n\nWe can now substitute this expression for $F_v$ into our force balance equation:\n$$ \\eta A \\frac{v}{h} = M_2 g $$\n\nOur goal is to find the viscosity $\\eta$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{M_2 g h}{A v} $$\n\nBefore substituting the numerical values, we need to calculate the contact area $A$.
