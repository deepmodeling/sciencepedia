A crucial part of the test involves accurately determining the vehicle's linear momentum, $p$, just before a controlled impact.

The mass of the test vehicle has been determined with a high degree of precision, but still has a fractional uncertainty of $\\frac{\\delta m}{m} = 0.025$. The speed is measured using a state-of-the-art laser-based system, which has a specified fractional uncertainty of $\\frac{\\delta v}{v} = 0.012$.
