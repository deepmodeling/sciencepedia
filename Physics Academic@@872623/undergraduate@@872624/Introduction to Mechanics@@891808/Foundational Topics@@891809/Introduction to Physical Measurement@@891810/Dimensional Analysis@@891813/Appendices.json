We can model the fundamental frequency of these pulsations using a simplified physical model. Assuming that the fundamental frequency of radial pulsation, $f$, of a non-rotating, uniform spherical star depends only on its mass $M$, its radius $R$, and the universal gravitational constant $G$, determine the functional relationship for $f$.
