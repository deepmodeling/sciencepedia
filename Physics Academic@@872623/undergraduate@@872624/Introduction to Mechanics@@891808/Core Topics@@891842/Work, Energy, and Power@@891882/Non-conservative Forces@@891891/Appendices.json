This exercise provides a clear and tangible example of this principle.

A small, solid sphere of mass $m$ is fabricated from this material. The experiment is conducted in a vacuum chamber to eliminate the effects of air resistance. The sphere is released from rest at a height $H$ above a massive, horizontal, and perfectly rigid target plate. The sphere falls, impacts the plate, and rebounds vertically to a new maximum height $h$, with $h  H$. The energy loss during the collision is attributed to the work done by non-conservative internal forces within the elastomer as it deforms and reforms. Let $g$ be the constant acceleration due to gravity.\n\nDetermine a symbolic expression for the work, $W_{nc}$, done by these internal non-conservative forces during the brief impact of the sphere with the plate. Express your answer in terms of $m$, $g$, $H$, and $h$.", "solution": "Consider the sphere as the system and include gravity as a conservative force with potential energy $U_{g} = m g y$. There are no non-conservative external forces such as air resistance, and the plate is perfectly rigid; the only non-conservative work is due to internal dissipation within the elastomer during impact.\n\nApply the work-energy relation including non-conservative work between the initial release (rest at height $H$) and the final state (rest at rebound height $h$):\n$$\nK_{f} + U_{g,f} = K_{i} + U_{g,i} + W_{nc}.\n$$\nAt release, $K_{i} = 0$ and $U_{g,i} = m g H$. At the rebound apex, $K_{f} = 0$ and $U_{g,f} = m g h$. Substituting these into the equation gives\n$$\n0 + m g h = 0 + m g H + W_{nc}.\n$$\nSolving for $W_{nc}$ yields\n$$\nW_{nc} = m g h - m g H = - m g (H - h).\n$$\nThis is negative since $h  H$, indicating that the internal non-conservative forces do negative work on the sphere, dissipating mechanical energy during the impact.
