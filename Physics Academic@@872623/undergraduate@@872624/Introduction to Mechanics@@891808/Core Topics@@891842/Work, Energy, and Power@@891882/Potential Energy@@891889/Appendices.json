These lattices are formed by the interference of laser beams, which creates a spatially periodic potential energy landscape. Consider a simplified one-dimensional model where a single atom of mass $m$ is constrained to move along the x-axis. The potential energy of the atom in this lattice is described by the function $U(x) = U_0 \\cos(kx)$, where $U_0$ is a positive constant representing the potential depth in Joules, and $k$ is a positive constant related to the laser wavelength, with units of inverse meters.\n\nDetermine a general expression for all positions $x$ where the magnitude of the force acting on the atom is a maximum.

The magnitude of the force is:\n$$ |F(x)| = |kU_0 \\sin(kx)| $$\nSince $U_0$ and $k$ are defined as positive constants, we can write:\n$$ |F(x)| = kU_0 |\\sin(kx)| $$\nTo maximize the magnitude of the force, $|F(x)|$, we need to maximize the term $|\\sin(kx)|$. The sine function, $\\sin(\\theta)$, oscillates between -1 and 1. Therefore, its absolute value, $|\\sin(\\theta)|$, has a maximum value of 1.\n\nThe magnitude of the force is maximized when $|\\sin(kx)| = 1$. This condition is met when $\\sin(kx) = 1$ or $\\sin(kx) = -1$.\nThis occurs when the argument of the sine function, $kx$, is an odd-integer multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.
