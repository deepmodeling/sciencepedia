This practice [@problem_id:2204023] directly confronts that intuition by combining Newton's Second and Third Laws.

This problem [@problem_id:2204014] pushes you to apply the concept to a more abstract scenario: the buoyant force in a fluid. Identifying the reaction to buoyancy requires you to think of the interaction between the submerged object and the entire body of water, deepening your understanding of forces as fundamental interactions between systems.", "problem": "A block of wood is held fully submerged in a container of water by a taut, massless string that is attached to the bottom of the container. The entire system is at rest on a flat, horizontal surface in a region with a uniform gravitational field.

The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the block.\n\nB. The downward tension force exerted by the string on the block.\n\nC. The net downward force exerted by the block on the water.\n\nD. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the volume of water displaced by the block.\n\nE. The vector sum of the gravitational force on the block and the tension force from the string.", "solution": "To identify the reaction force corresponding to the buoyant force, we must apply Newton's third law of motion. This law states that for every action force, there is a reaction force that is equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and of the same type. Crucially, the action and reaction forces always act on two different, interacting objects. If force $\\vec{F}_{A \\text{ on } B}$ is the force exerted by object A on object B, its reaction force is $\\vec{F}_{B \\text{ on } A}$, the force exerted by object B on object A.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the \"action\" force.\nThe problem defines the action force as the buoyant force, $\\vec{F}_B$. This force is explicitly described as \"the net upward force exerted by the water on the block\". In our notation, this is $\\vec{F}_{\\text{water on block}}$. The object exerting the force is the water, and the object experiencing the force is the block. The interaction is a contact force arising from fluid pressure.\n\nStep 2: Apply Newton's third law to find the \"reaction\" force.\nBased on Newton's third law, the reaction force must be the force exerted by the block on the water. It must be equal in magnitude to $\\vec{F}_B$ and opposite in direction. Since $\\vec{F}_B$ is directed upward, the reaction force must be directed downward. The interaction type must also be the same, i.e., a contact force.\nTherefore, the reaction force is the net downward contact force exerted by the block on the water, which can be written as $\\vec{F}_{\\text{block on water}}$.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the given options against this conclusion.\n- Option A: \"The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the block.\" This is the weight of the block, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{Earth on block}}$. This force is exerted by the Earth, not the block. The interacting pair is Earth-block, not water-block. Thus, this is not the reaction force to the buoyant force. Its reaction pair would be the gravitational force exerted by the block on the Earth.\n\n- Option B: \"The downward tension force exerted by the string on the block.\" This is the tension, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{string on block}}$. This force is exerted by the string, not the water. The interacting pair is string-block, not water-block. Thus, this is not the correct reaction force.\n\n- Option C: \"The net downward force exerted by the block on the water.\" This is the force $\\vec{F}_{\\text{block on water}}$. The object exerting the force is the block, and the object experiencing it is the water. The direction is downward, opposite to the upward buoyant force. This fits the description of the reaction force derived from Newton's third law perfectly.\n\n- Option D: \"The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the volume of water displaced by the block.\" This is the weight of the displaced water, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{Earth on displaced water}}$. By Archimedes' principle, the *magnitude* of this force is equal to the magnitude of the buoyant force. However, this is a gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the water, not a contact force exerted by the block on the water. The interacting pair is Earth-water, not block-water. Therefore, it is not the reaction force.\n\n- Option E: \"The vector sum of the gravitational force on the block and the tension force from the string.\" This sum of forces, $\\vec{W} + \\vec{T}$, acts on the *same object*, the block. Since the block is in equilibrium, this sum is indeed equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the buoyant force ($\\vec{F}_B + \\vec{W} + \\vec{T} = 0$, so $\\vec{W} + \\vec{T} = -\\vec{F}_B$). However, this relationship is a consequence of Newton's first law (the condition for equilibrium), not Newton's third law. An action-reaction pair can never act on the same object.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only correct description of the reaction force to the buoyant force is the net downward force exerted by the block on the water.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2204014"}]}
