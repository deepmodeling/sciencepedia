This scenario is common in many physical systems, from light entering the atmosphere to sound waves in a non-uniform fluid. This problem introduces the powerful adiabatic approximation, where for a gradual change in the medium, reflections are negligible and the wave adapts its form while conserving certain properties. By analyzing how a pulse's width changes as it traverses a string of varying density, you will learn how wave characteristics are linked to the properties of the medium and gain insight into the conditions under which a wave propagates without significant scattering [@problem_id:2221765].", "problem": "A long, flexible string is held under a constant tension $T$.

Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $W_0$, $\\mu_0$, and $\\mu_f$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the final width of a wave pulse after it travels through a region of varying mass density. The fundamental principle governing the pulse's behavior is the relationship between its speed, its spatial width, and its temporal duration.\n\nFirst, let's establish the wave speed on the string. The speed $v$ of a transverse wave on a string is given by the formula:\n$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$$\nwhere $T$ is the tension and $\\mu$ is the mass per unit length.\n\nIn the initial region ($x  0$), the mass density is constant at $\\mu_0$. Therefore, the initial speed of the pulse is:\n$$v_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu_0}}$$\n\nIn the final region ($x  L$), the mass density is constant at $\\mu_f$. The final speed of the pulse in this region is:\n$$v_f = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu_f}}$$\n\nNow, consider the properties of the pulse itself. The spatial width $W$ of the pulse is the length it occupies on the string at a single instant in time. The temporal duration, let's call it $\\Delta t$, is the time interval it takes for the entire pulse to pass a fixed point on the string. These three quantities are related by:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{W}{v}$$\n\nThe problem states that the change in mass density is \"sufficiently gradual.\" In the context of wave mechanics, this is an adiabatic approximation. A key consequence of an adiabatic change in the medium's properties is that the frequency components of the wave packet are conserved. This means that the temporal structure of the pulse remains unchanged. Therefore, the temporal duration $\\Delta t$ of the pulse is a conserved quantity as it propagates from Region 1 to Region 3.\n\nLet's apply this conservation principle. The initial temporal duration of the pulse in the region $x  0$ is:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{W_0}{v_0}$$\n\nAfter the pulse has passed into the region $x  L$, it has a new width $W_f$ and a new speed $v_f$. Its temporal duration in this region is:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{W_f}{v_f}$$\n\nSince the temporal duration $\\Delta t$ is conserved, we can equate these two expressions:\n$$\\frac{W_0}{v_0} = \\frac{W_f}{v_f}$$\n\nWe can now solve for the final width $W_f$:\n$$W_f = W_0 \\frac{v_f}{v_0}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the initial speed $v_0$ and the final speed $v_f$:\n$$W_f = W_0 \\frac{\\sqrt{T/\\mu_f}}{\\sqrt{T/\\mu_0}}$$\n\nThe tension $T$ is constant and cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n$$W_f = W_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{1/\\mu_f}{1/\\mu_0}}$$\n\nSimplifying this expression gives the final relationship between the initial and final widths:\n$$W_f = W_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_0}{\\mu_f}}$$\n\nNote that the specific linear form of $\\mu(x)$ in the transition region $0 \\le x \\le L$ and the length $L$ itself are not required to find the final width.
