The entire system, consisting of the scientist, platform, and buoy, is initially at rest relative to the water.\n\nThe scientist then throws the buoy horizontally off the rear of the platform. Immediately after being released, the buoy has a horizontal velocity of magnitude $v_b = 5.00 \\text{ m/s}$ relative to the water. Assuming dissipative effects like air resistance and drag from the water are negligible, what is the velocity of the center of mass of the combined scientist-platform-buoy system, relative to the water? Express your answer in m/s.", "solution": "We analyze horizontal motion, taking the water as an inertial frame. External horizontal forces are negligible by assumption (drag neglected); buoyant and weight forces are vertical. Therefore, the total horizontal momentum of the closed system (scientist + platform + buoy) is conserved.\n\nLet the total mass be $M = m_{s} + m_{p} + m_{b}$.
