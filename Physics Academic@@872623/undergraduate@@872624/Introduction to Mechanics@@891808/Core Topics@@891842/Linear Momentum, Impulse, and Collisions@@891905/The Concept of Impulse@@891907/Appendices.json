Both projectiles have an identical mass, $m$, and are fired perpendicularly towards the plate with the same initial speed, $v$.

This classic problem can seem daunting if you try to calculate the continuously changing force from the accumulating weight and the impact of new segments. However, it offers a beautiful illustration of a powerful problem-solving strategy: applying the impulse-momentum theorem to the entire system reveals a surprisingly elegant solution, bypassing the need for direct force integration.", "problem": "In an industrial quality control process, a uniform, heavy, flexible chain of total mass $M$ and total length $L$ is tested. The chain is held stationary and vertically, such that its lower end is just about to touch the surface of a large, horizontal force plate (a device that measures force).

Express your answer as an analytic expression in terms of $M$, $L$, and the acceleration due to gravity, $g$.", "solution": "Let's solve this problem using two different methods. The first method involves integrating the time-varying force, and the second method uses the impulse-momentum theorem for the entire system.\n\n**Method 1: Direct Integration of Force**\n\nFirst, let's define the linear mass density of the chain, $\\lambda = \\frac{M}{L}$. We will analyze the force on the scale at an arbitrary time $t$ after the release. Let the downward direction be positive.\n\nThe force exerted on the force plate at any instant has two components:\n1.  The weight of the part of the chain that is already at rest on the plate, $F_{weight}$.\n2.  The impact force from the segment of the chain that is currently hitting the plate and being brought to rest, $F_{impact}$.\n\nLet $x$ be the length of the chain that has landed on the plate at time $t$. Since the chain is released from rest and undergoes free fall, the relationship between the fallen distance $x$ and time $t$ is given by $x = \\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}$.\n\nThe mass of the chain resting on the plate is $m_{rest} = \\lambda x$. The weight of this part is:\n$$ F_{weight} = m_{rest} g = (\\lambda x) g $$\n\nNow, consider the impact force. The speed of the segment of the chain just before it hits the plate can be found from the kinematics of free fall from a height $x$: $v^{2} = 2gx$, so $v = \\sqrt{2gx}$.\nThe impact force is the rate of change of momentum of the falling part of the chain. In a small time interval $dt$, a small mass element $dm$ hits the plate. The length of this element is $dx$, so $dm = \\lambda \\, dx$. The momentum of this element is $dp = (dm) v = (\\lambda \\, dx) v$.\nThe impact force is $F_{impact} = \\frac{dp}{dt} = \\frac{\\lambda v \\, dx}{dt}$.\nSince the velocity of the incoming segment is $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$, this simplifies to:\n$$ F_{impact} = \\lambda v^{2} $$\nSubstituting $v^{2} = 2gx$, we get:\n$$ F_{impact} = \\lambda (2gx) = 2\\lambda gx $$\n\nThe total force on the plate as a function of the length $x$ on the plate is the sum of these two components:\n$$ F_{total}(x) = F_{weight} + F_{impact} = \\lambda gx + 2\\lambda gx = 3\\lambda gx $$\nNote that when the last link hits the plate ($x=L$), the instantaneous force reading is $3\\lambda gL = 3Mg$, or three times the weight of the chain.\n\nTo find the total impulse, $J$, we must integrate this force over the total time of the process. The process starts at $t=0$ and ends when the entire chain has landed, i.e., when $x=L$. Let's call this final time $t_{f}$. We can find $t_{f}$ from $L = \\frac{1}{2}gt_{f}^{2}$, which gives $t_{f} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2L}{g}}$.\n\nWe need to express the force as a function of time, $F_{total}(t)$, before integrating.\n$$ F_{total}(t) = 3\\lambda g x(t) = 3\\lambda g \\left( \\frac{1}{2}gt^{2} \\right) = \\frac{3}{2}\\lambda g^{2} t^{2} $$\nThe total impulse $J$ is the integral of this force from $t=0$ to $t=t_{f}$:\n$$ J = \\int_{0}^{t_{f}} F_{total}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{t_{f}} \\frac{3}{2}\\lambda g^{2} t^{2} \\, dt $$\n$$ J = \\frac{3}{2}\\lambda g^{2} \\left[ \\frac{t^{3}}{3} \\right]_{0}^{t_{f}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda g^{2} t_{f}^{3} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $t_{f}$:\n$$ J = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda g^{2} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2L}{g}} \\right)^{3} = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda g^{2} \\frac{(2L)^{3/2}}{g^{3/2}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda g^{1/2} (2^{3/2} L^{3/2}) $$\n$$ J = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda \\sqrt{g} (2\\sqrt{2} L\\sqrt{L}) = \\lambda \\sqrt{2g} L\\sqrt{L} = \\lambda \\sqrt{2gL^{3}} $$\nFinally, substitute back $\\lambda = M/L$:\n$$ J = \\frac{M}{L} \\sqrt{2gL^{3}} = M \\sqrt{\\frac{2gL^{3}}{L^{2}}} = M\\sqrt{2gL} $$\n\n**Method 2: Impulse-Momentum Theorem for the System**\n\nLet's consider the entire chain as our system. The external forces acting on the system are the force of gravity, $F_g$, acting downwards, and the normal force from the force plate, $F_N$, acting upwards.\n\nThe impulse-momentum theorem states that the net external impulse on a system equals the change in the system's total momentum: $J_{net} = \\Delta P_{total}$.\nThe net impulse is the sum of the impulse from gravity, $J_g$, and the impulse from the scale, $J_{scale}$: $J_{net} = J_g + J_{scale}$.\n\nLet's determine the change in the total momentum of the chain.\nInitial state: The entire chain is at rest. The initial momentum is $P_{i} = 0$.\nFinal state: The entire chain is coiled up at rest on the plate. The final momentum is $P_{f} = 0$.\nTherefore, the total change in momentum of the system is $\\Delta P_{total} = P_{f} - P_{i} = 0$.\n\nThis implies that the net external impulse on the system is zero:\n$$ J_{net} = J_g + J_{scale} = 0 \\implies J_{scale} = -J_g $$\nThe impulse from the scale on the chain, $J_{scale}$, is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the impulse from gravity, $J_g$.\n\nThe force of gravity on the entire chain is constant, $F_g = Mg$, acting downwards. The impulse from gravity is this force multiplied by the duration of the process, $t_f$. The duration $t_f$ is the time it takes for the top-most link of the chain to fall the full distance $L$. Using kinematics for an object in free fall from rest:\n$$ L = \\frac{1}{2}gt_{f}^{2} \\implies t_{f} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2L}{g}} $$\nThe impulse due to gravity is $J_g = F_g t_{f} = Mg t_{f}$. So, the magnitude of the gravitational impulse is:\n$$ |J_g| = Mg \\sqrt{\\frac{2L}{g}} $$\nWe can bring $g$ inside the square root:\n$$ |J_g| = M \\sqrt{g^{2} \\frac{2L}{g}} = M\\sqrt{2gL} $$\nThe magnitude of the impulse exerted by the scale on the chain is therefore $|J_{scale}| = |J_g| = M\\sqrt{2gL}$.\n\nBy Newton's third law, the impulse exerted *by the chain on the scale* is equal in magnitude to the impulse exerted *by the scale on the chain*. Therefore, the magnitude of the total impulse delivered by the chain to the force plate is:\n$$ J = M\\sqrt{2gL} $$\nBoth methods yield the same result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{M\\sqrt{2gL}}$$", "id": "2218800"}]}
