This exercise [@problem_id:2199451] presents a scenario involving internal movements within a system, challenging you to apply the conservation principle by focusing only on the initial and final states. Mastering this helps distinguish between internal interactions, which do not alter the system's total momentum, and external actions that do.", "problem": "A symmetric canoe of mass $M$ and length $L$ is initially at rest, floating on calm water. A person of mass $m$, initially positioned at the bow of the canoe, is holding a package of mass $m_p$. The person walks from the bow to the stern. Immediately upon reaching the stern, the person heaves the package horizontally backward (away from the canoe) with a speed $v_{rel}$ relative to the person. The person then remains stationary at the stern of the canoe. Assume that the water offers no resistance to the horizontal motion of the canoe.\n\nDetermine the final velocity of the canoe relative to the water. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $m$, $M$, $m_p$, and $v_{rel}$.", "solution": "Choose a horizontal axis with the positive direction from stern to bow. There are no external horizontal forces on the closed system (canoe + person + package), so total horizontal momentum is conserved at all times. Initially, the system is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero.\n\nImmediately after the throw, the person remains stationary relative to the canoe, so the person and the canoe move together with some common velocity $V_{f}$ relative to the water. The package is heaved backward with speed $v_{rel}$ relative to the person, so its velocity relative to the water is $V_{f}-v_{rel}$ (negative relative to the canoe if $v_{rel}>V_{f}$).\n\nConservation of total horizontal momentum between the initial state and the final state gives\n$$\n0 = M V_{f} + m V_{f} + m_{p}\\left(V_{f} - v_{rel}\\right).\n$$\nCollect terms in $V_{f}$:\n$$\n0 = \\left(M + m + m_{p}\\right) V_{f} - m_{p} v_{rel}.\n$$\nSolve for $V_{f}$:\n$$\nV_{f} = \\frac{m_{p} v_{rel}}{M + m + m_{p}}.\n$$\nThis result is independent of any details of the prior walking because the total momentum of the closed system remains zero throughout.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{m_{p} v_{rel}}{M + m + m_{p}}}$$", "id": "2199451"}, {"introduction": "Real-world problems often involve multiple physical principles acting in sequence.
