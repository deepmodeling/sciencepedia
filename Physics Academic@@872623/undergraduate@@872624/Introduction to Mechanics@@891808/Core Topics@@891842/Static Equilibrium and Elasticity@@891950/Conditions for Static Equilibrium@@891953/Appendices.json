To achieve this, three vertical cables are used. The first cable is attached at the far-left end of the beam. The second cable is attached at a distance of $L/4$ from the left end. The third cable is attached at the far-right end. When the beam is slowly lifted and held in static equilibrium (i.e., motionless and perfectly horizontal), it is observed that the tension in each of the three cables is identical.\n\nLet the position of the left end of the beam be the origin, $x=0$. Determine the position of the beam's center of gravity, $x_{cg}$. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $L$.", "solution": "Let the three cable tensions be equal to $T$.
