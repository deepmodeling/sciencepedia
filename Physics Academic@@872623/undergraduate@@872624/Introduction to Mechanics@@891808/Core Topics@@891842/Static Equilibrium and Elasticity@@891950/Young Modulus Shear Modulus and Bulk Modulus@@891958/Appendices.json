Consider a solid cylindrical rod of initial length $L$ and uniform cross-sectional area $A$. The rod is made from a homogeneous, isotropic material. For such a material, the elastic property under axial tension or compression is characterized by its Young's modulus, $E$, defined as the ratio of axial stress (force per unit area) to axial strain (fractional change in length), provided the deformation is small and within the material's elastic limit.\n\nIf this rod is subjected to an axial force, it will deform slightly in length. For small deformations, the rod's response can be modeled by Hooke's Law, $F = k \\Delta L$, where $F$ is the applied axial force, $\\Delta L$ is the change in length, and $k$ is the effective spring constant.\n\nDetermine the effective spring constant $k$ of this rod.
