A car of mass $m$ was traveling up a long, straight road with a constant inclination angle $\\theta$ with respect to the horizontal. The driver suddenly applied the brakes, causing all four wheels to lock and skid. The car came to a complete stop after leaving skid marks of a uniform length $L$. The initial speed of the car at the moment the brakes were applied was $v_0$. Assuming the only forces acting on the car parallel to the road surface during the skid are friction and a component of gravity, derive an expression for the coefficient of kinetic friction, $\\mu_k$, between the tires and the road surface.

Kinetic friction is a classic example of a non-conservative force, meaning it does work that dissipates a system's mechanical energy, typically as heat. This exercise uses a simple pendulum to explore this principle, challenging you to use the work-energy theorem to relate the energy lost to friction over a small patch to the resulting change in the pendulum's maximum height [@problem_id:2198693].", "problem": "In a quality control laboratory, a new low-friction surface coating is being tested. The test involves a simple pendulum consisting of a small bob of mass $m$ attached to a massless, inextensible string. The pendulum bob is released from rest at an initial height $h$ above its lowest point. At the very bottom of its swing, the bob just scrapes across a short, horizontal test strip of length $L$ coated with the material being tested. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the bob and this strip is $\\mu_k$. After crossing the strip, the bob continues its swing and rises on the opposite side. Assuming the period of the pendulum is long enough that the interaction with the strip can be considered to occur entirely at the lowest point of the arc, derive an expression for the maximum height $h'$ that the bob reaches on the other side. Express your answer in terms of the given parameters $h$, $L$, and $\\mu_k$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.", "solution": "We will solve this problem using the work-energy theorem. The theorem states that the work done by all non-conservative forces, $W_{nc}$, is equal to the change in the total mechanical energy of the system, $\\Delta E_{mech}$. The mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy ($K$) and potential energy ($U$).\n$$W_{nc} = \\Delta E_{mech} = E_{final} - E_{initial}$$\n\nFirst, let's define the initial and final states of the pendulum bob. We will set the gravitational potential energy to be zero ($U=0$) at the lowest point of the pendulum's swing.\n\nThe initial state is when the bob is released from rest at a height $h$.\nThe initial kinetic energy is $K_{initial} = 0$, since the bob starts from rest.\nThe initial potential energy is $U_{initial} = mgh$.\nTherefore, the total initial mechanical energy is $E_{initial} = K_{initial} + U_{initial} = 0 + mgh = mgh$.\n\nThe final state is when the bob reaches its maximum height $h'$ on the other side of the swing. At this maximum height, the bob momentarily comes to rest.\nThe final kinetic energy is $K_{final} = 0$.\nThe final potential energy is $U_{final} = mgh'$.\nTherefore, the total final mechanical energy is $E_{final} = K_{final} + U_{final} = 0 + mgh' = mgh'$.\n\nNext, we identify the non-conservative forces and calculate the work they do. The forces acting on the bob are gravity (conservative), tension (does no work as it's always perpendicular to the velocity), and friction (non-conservative). The only non-conservative force that performs work is the kinetic friction as the bob slides across the test strip.\n\nThe work is done over the length of the strip, $L$. The force of kinetic friction, $f_k$, is given by $f_k = \\mu_k N$, where $N$ is the normal force. For this problem, we'll make the simplifying assumption that the normal force on the bob as it crosses the strip is equal to its weight, so $N = mg$.\nThe friction force is then $f_k = \\mu_k mg$.\n\nWork is defined as $W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{d}$.
