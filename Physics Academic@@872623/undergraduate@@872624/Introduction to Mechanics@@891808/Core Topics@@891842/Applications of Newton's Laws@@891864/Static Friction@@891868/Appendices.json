Your final answer should be a symbolic expression in terms of $M$, $m_1$, and $m_2$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum coefficient of static friction, $\\mu_s$, that will keep the system in equilibrium. This means the net force on each of the three blocks must be zero, according to Newton's First Law. We will analyze the forces on each block individually. Let $g$ be the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFirst, consider the hanging block of mass $m_1$. There are two forces acting on it: the gravitational force $m_1 g$ acting downwards, and the tension $T_1$ from the string acting upwards. For the block to be in equilibrium, these forces must balance:\n$$ T_1 - m_1 g = 0 $$\n$$ T_1 = m_1 g $$\n\nNext, consider the hanging block of mass $m_2$. Similarly, there are two forces acting on it: the gravitational force $m_2 g$ acting downwards, and the tension $T_2$ from the second string acting upwards. For equilibrium:\n$$ T_2 - m_2 g = 0 $$\n$$ T_2 = m_2 g $$\n\nNow, we analyze the forces on the central block of mass $M$. In the vertical direction, we have the gravitational force $Mg$ acting downwards and the normal force $N$ from the surface acting upwards. Since there is no vertical motion, these forces must be equal:\n$$ N - Mg = 0 $$\n$$ N = Mg $$\n\nIn the horizontal direction, there are three forces. The tension $T_1$ pulls the block in one direction (let's call this the positive direction), the tension $T_2$ pulls in the opposite (negative) direction, and the force of static friction, $f_s$, acts to oppose the impending motion. Since the problem states that $m_1  m_2$, it follows that $T_1  T_2$. Therefore, the system has a tendency to move in the direction of the pull from $T_1$. The static friction force $f_s$ must oppose this tendency, so it acts in the same direction as $T_2$ (the negative direction). The condition for static equilibrium in the horizontal direction is:\n$$ T_1 - T_2 - f_s = 0 $$\n\nWe are looking for the *minimum* coefficient of static friction, $\\mu_s$, that prevents motion. This minimum value corresponds to the limiting case where the static friction force reaches its maximum possible value, $f_{s, \\text{max}}$. The maximum static friction is related to the normal force and the coefficient of static friction by the equation:\n$$ f_s = f_{s, \\text{max}} = \\mu_s N $$\n\nSubstituting this into the horizontal force balance equation:\n$$ T_1 - T_2 - \\mu_s N = 0 $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for $T_1$, $T_2$, and $N$ that we found earlier:\n$$ m_1 g - m_2 g - \\mu_s (Mg) = 0 $$\n\nOur goal is to solve for $\\mu_s$. We can first factor out $g$ from the terms on the left side:\n$$ g(m_1 - m_2) - \\mu_s M g = 0 $$\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to isolate the term with $\\mu_s$:\n$$ \\mu_s M g = g(m_1 - m_2) $$\n\nSince $g$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $g$. Also, assuming $M$ is non-zero, we can divide by $M$:\n$$ \\mu_s M = m_1 - m_2 $$\n$$ \\mu_s = \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{M} $$\nThis expression gives the minimum coefficient of static friction required to keep the system in equilibrium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{m_1 - m_2}{M}}$$", "id": "2200012"}, {"introduction": "Static friction is not a force with a single value, but one that adapts to prevent motion. This exercise explores that unique characteristic by examining a block attached to a spring, where friction allows for a continuous range of stable equilibrium positions [@problem_id:2215219].

There are three horizontal forces: the spring force $F_s$, the applied external force $F_0$, and the static friction force $f_s$.\n\nIn the vertical direction, the gravitational force $F_g = mg$ acting downwards is balanced by the normal force $N$ from the surface acting upwards. Thus, $N = mg$.\n\nThe maximum possible magnitude of the static friction force is given by $f_{s,max} = \\mu_s N = \\mu_s mg$. This force can act in either the positive or negative horizontal direction, opposing the tendency of motion.\n\nFor the block to be in static equilibrium at a position $x$, the net horizontal force on it must be zero.
