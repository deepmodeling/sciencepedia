The net work is the sum of the work done by all individual forces acting on the ball as it moves along the distance $d$. The forces are:\n1.  The force from the spring, $F_{spring}$.

At time $t=0$, the mechanism releases the spring, launching the sensor package horizontally. Assuming the launch occurs along the positive x-axis, determine the final velocity of the rover. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $M$, $m$, $k$, and $d$.", "solution": "This problem can be solved by applying two fundamental principles of classical mechanics: the conservation of linear momentum and the conservation of mechanical energy. Let's denote the final velocity of the rover as $V$ and the final velocity of the sensor package as $v$. The problem specifies that the sensor is launched along the positive x-axis, so we can treat this as a one-dimensional problem.\n\nFirst, we apply the principle of conservation of linear momentum. The system consists of the rover and the sensor package. Since the rover is on a frictionless surface, there are no external horizontal forces acting on the system. Therefore, the total linear momentum of the system must be conserved.\n\nThe initial state of the system is the rover and the compressed sensor package at rest. The total initial momentum $p_i$ is zero.\n$$p_i = (M+m) \\cdot 0 = 0$$\n\nThe final state is after the sensor has been launched. The rover has velocity $V$ and the sensor package has velocity $v$. The total final momentum $p_f$ is the sum of the momenta of the two objects.\n$$p_f = M V + m v$$\n\nBy conservation of momentum, $p_i = p_f$:\n$$0 = M V + m v$$\nThis equation relates the two final velocities. We can express one in terms of the other. Let's solve for $v$:\n$$v = -\\frac{M}{m} V$$\nThis equation shows that the rover and the sensor package move in opposite directions, as expected.\n\nNext, we apply the principle of conservation of mechanical energy. Since the surface is frictionless and the spring is ideal, there are no non-conservative forces doing work on the system. Thus, the total mechanical energy is conserved.\n\nThe initial energy $E_i$ of the system is purely the potential energy stored in the compressed spring. The initial kinetic energy is zero because the system is at rest.\n$$E_i = \\frac{1}{2} k d^2$$\n\nThe final energy $E_f$ of the system is the sum of the kinetic energies of the rover and the sensor package. Once the spring is released and the package has separated, the spring is at its equilibrium length, so its potential energy is zero.\n$$E_f = \\frac{1}{2} M V^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m v^2$$\n\nBy conservation of energy, $E_i = E_f$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} k d^2 = \\frac{1}{2} M V^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m v^2$$\nWe can cancel the factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ from all terms:\n$$k d^2 = M V^2 + m v^2$$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $V$ and $v$. We want to find $V$. We substitute the expression for $v$ from the momentum conservation equation into the energy conservation equation.\n$$k d^2 = M V^2 + m \\left(-\\frac{M}{m} V\\right)^2$$\n$$k d^2 = M V^2 + m \\left(\\frac{M^2}{m^2} V^2\\right)$$\n$$k d^2 = M V^2 + \\frac{M^2}{m} V^2$$\n\nNow, we solve for $V$. Factor out $V^2$ on the right-hand side:\n$$k d^2 = \\left(M + \\frac{M^2}{m}\\right) V^2$$\nTo combine the terms in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator:\n$$k d^2 = \\left(\\frac{Mm + M^2}{m}\\right) V^2$$\n$$k d^2 = \\left(\\frac{M(m + M)}{m}\\right) V^2$$\n\nIsolate $V^2$:\n$$V^2 = \\frac{k d^2 m}{M(M+m)}$$\n\nFinally, we take the square root to find $V$. Since the sensor package is launched in the positive x-direction (meaning $v > 0$), our momentum relation $V = -(m/M)v$ implies that $V$ must be negative.\n$$V = -\\sqrt{\\frac{k d^2 m}{M(M+m)}}$$\nWe can pull the $d$ out of the square root since $d$ is a distance and therefore positive.\n$$V = -d \\sqrt{\\frac{k m}{M(M+m)}}$$\nThis is the final velocity of the rover.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-d \\sqrt{\\frac{k m}{M(M+m)}}}$$", "id": "2224608"}]}
