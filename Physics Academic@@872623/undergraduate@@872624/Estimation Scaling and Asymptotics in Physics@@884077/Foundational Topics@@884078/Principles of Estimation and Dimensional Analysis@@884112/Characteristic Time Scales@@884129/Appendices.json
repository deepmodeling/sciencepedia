The spring has a total mass $M$, an unstretched length $L_0$, and an overall spring constant $k$. It is suspended vertically from a high ceiling and allowed to come to rest in equilibrium, stretched by its own weight. At time $t=0$, the support at the top end of the spring is instantaneously released, allowing the entire spring to fall.

This final practice moves beyond calculation to derivation, tasking you with estimating the time scale for a major geophysical process: post-glacial rebound [@problem_id:1890679]. Using dimensional analysis and physical reasoning to balance viscous and buoyant forces, you will uncover the fundamental relationship governing how quickly the Earth's crust adjusts after an ice age.", "problem": "During an ice age, the immense weight of a continental ice sheet, with a characteristic horizontal scale $L$, causes the Earth's crust to be depressed into the underlying mantle. The mantle can be modeled as an extremely viscous fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\eta$ and density $\\rho_m$. After the ice sheet melts, the crust begins to rebound to its equilibrium position. This process, known as post-glacial rebound, is governed by the slow, viscous \"creep flow\" of the mantle material back into the region beneath the rising crust. The driving force for this uplift is the buoyancy from the displaced mantle.
