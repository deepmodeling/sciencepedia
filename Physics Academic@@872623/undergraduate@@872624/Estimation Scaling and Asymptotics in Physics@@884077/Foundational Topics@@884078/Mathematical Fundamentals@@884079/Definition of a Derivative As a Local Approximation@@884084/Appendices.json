This first exercise establishes a remarkably simple and general rule for estimating how a small fractional change in a variable propagates to a quantity that depends on it via a power law. Understanding this relationship is the first step towards mastering the art of physical estimation and sensitivity analysis [@problem_id:1895267].", "problem": "In many areas of physics and engineering, a physical quantity of interest, $Q$, is related to a variable parameter, $x$, by a power-law relationship of the form $Q(x) = C x^{n}$. In this expression, $C$ is a constant of proportionality and $n$ is a fixed, non-zero exponent. For example, the kinetic energy of a particle of mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, which follows a power law with $Q=K$, $x=v$, and $n=2$.\n\nWhen designing or analyzing physical systems, it is crucial to understand how a small change in the input parameter $x$ affects the output quantity $Q$.
