Over a long calibration run, they discover that the detector's efficiency is not constant but changes predictably over time. The instantaneous rate of neutrino detection, $\\lambda(t)$, is modeled by the function $\\lambda(t) = \\lambda_0 (1 + \\alpha t)$, where $t$ is the time elapsed in hours since the beginning of an observation, $\\lambda_0$ is the initial detection rate in events per hour, and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant with units of inverse hours that characterizes the rate of change of the detector's efficiency.\n\nDuring a specific observation period lasting a total time $T$, the system records that *exactly one* neutrino was detected.

Let $E$ be the event that the single detection occurred in the interval $[0, T/2]$. Let $C$ be the condition that exactly one event was detected in the total interval $[0, T]$. We want to compute $P(E|C)$.\n\nBy the definition of conditional probability, $P(E|C) = \\frac{P(E \\cap C)}{P(C)}$.\nThe event $E \\cap C$ means \"exactly one event occurred in $[0, T/2]$ AND exactly one event occurred in total in $[0, T]$\". This is equivalent to \"exactly one event occurred in $[0, T/2]$ AND zero events occurred in $(T/2, T]$\". Let's call this event $E_1$. So, we need to compute $\\frac{P(E_1)}{P(C)}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the required integrated rates.\nLet the first interval be $I_1 = [0, T/2]$ and the second interval be $I_2 = (T/2, T]$.\nThe integrated rate over $I_1$ is:\n$$\\Lambda_1 = \\Lambda(0, T/2) = \\int_{0}^{T/2} \\lambda_0 (1 + \\alpha t) dt = \\lambda_0 \\left[t + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t^2\\right]_{0}^{T/2}$$\n$$\\Lambda_1 = \\lambda_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha \\left(\\frac{T}{2}\\right)^2 - 0\\right) = \\lambda_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{2} + \\frac{\\alpha T^2}{8}\\right)$$\n\nThe integrated rate over the total interval $[0, T]$ is:\n$$\\Lambda_{total} = \\Lambda(0, T) = \\int_{0}^{T} \\lambda_0 (1 + \\alpha t) dt = \\lambda_0 \\left[t + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t^2\\right]_{0}^{T}$$\n$$\\Lambda_{total} = \\lambda_0 \\left(T + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha T^2\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities of the events $E_1$ and $C$.\nThe event $E_1$ is one event in $I_1$ and zero events in $I_2$. Since events in disjoint intervals of a Poisson process are independent, we have:\n$$P(E_1) = P(1; I_1) \\times P(0; I_2)$$\nLet $\\Lambda_2 = \\Lambda(T/2, T)$.
