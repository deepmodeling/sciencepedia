The final and most crucial stage of this delivery process occurs in the capillaries, which are the smallest blood vessels. Their pervasiveness is essential, as the process of passive diffusion, which governs nutrient and gas exchange, is only effective over very short distances. In this problem, we will estimate the total length of this remarkable capillary network using a simplified physiological model.\n\nWe will model the human body as being composed of tissue with a uniform density. To ensure all cells are adequately supplied with nutrients, we can imagine that the tissue is partitioned into a vast number of long, thin cylinders, with a single capillary running along the central axis of each cylinder. The radius of each of these cylinders, often called the \"Krogh radius,\" is determined by the maximum distance over which nutrients can effectively diffuse from the central capillary to the surrounding tissue cells. The total volume of all these conceptual cylinders is assumed to be equal to the total volume of the body.\n\nYou are given the following parameters for an average adult:\n*   The total mass of the body, $M = 70.0 \\text{ kg}$.\n*   The average density of the body, which can be approximated as the density of water, $\\rho = 1.00 \\times 10^3 \\text{ kg/m}^3$.\n*   The maximum effective diffusion distance, which defines the Krogh radius, $d = 30.0 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nBased on this model, calculate the total length of the capillary network in the human body.

The model states that the entire volume of the body, $V_{\\text{body}}$, is serviced by the capillary network. We model this by imagining the body is made up of numerous small cylinders of tissue, each with a capillary at its center. The total volume of these cylinders is equal to the body's volume.\n\nLet $L_{\\text{total}}$ be the total length of the capillary network. If we consider this entire network to be servicing a cylindrical volume of tissue with a cross-sectional area defined by the Krogh radius $d$, the total volume serviced can be written as the product of this effective area and the total length. The effective cross-sectional area serviced by a unit length of capillary is $A_{\\text{Krogh}} = \\pi d^2$. Therefore, the total volume of the body can be expressed as:\n$$V_{\\text{body}} = L_{\\text{total}} \\times A_{\\text{Krogh}} = L_{\\text{total}} (\\pi d^2)$$\n\nFrom this relation, we can solve for the total length, $L_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$L_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{body}}}{\\pi d^2}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the necessary quantities using the provided parameters.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total volume of the body, $V_{\\text{body}}$.\nWe are given the mass $M = 70.0 \\text{ kg}$ and the density $\\rho = 1.00 \\times 10^3 \\text{ kg/m}^3$.\n$$V_{\\text{body}} = \\frac{M}{\\rho} = \\frac{70.0 \\text{ kg}}{1.00 \\times 10^3 \\text{ kg/m}^3} = 7.00 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m}^3$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the effective cross-sectional area, $A_{\\text{Krogh}}$.\nWe are given the Krogh radius $d = 30.0 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$.
