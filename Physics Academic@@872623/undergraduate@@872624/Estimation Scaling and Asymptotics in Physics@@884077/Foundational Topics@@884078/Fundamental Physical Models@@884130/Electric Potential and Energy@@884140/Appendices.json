We model this process by assuming that a net charge is deposited with a constant surface charge density $\\sigma_0$ onto the parts of the sphere's surface that make contact with the ramp. Assume the microscopic contact patch between the sphere and the ramp can be modeled as a rectangle of constant, very small width $w$.\n\nAfter the sphere has rolled a total distance $L$ along the ramp, it has accumulated some charge, resulting in a certain amount of electrostatic self-energy, $U$.

In our case, the charge is confined to the surface of a sphere of radius $R$.
