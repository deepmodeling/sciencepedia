This qualitative problem [@problem_id:1891282] uses the familiar example of a spinning egg to explore the conservation of angular momentum within a system that has internal moving parts. It challenges us to see how a conserved quantity can be redistributed among the components of a system, leading to counter-intuitive but physically correct outcomes.", "problem": "Two objects, labeled Solid and Fluid, are identical in their external appearance, each having a total mass $M$ and an ellipsoidal shape. The Solid object is a uniform rigid body. The Fluid object consists of a thin, rigid outer shell of mass $m_s$ and an internal, incompressible fluid of mass $m_f$, such that $m_s + m_f = M$.\n\nBoth objects are individually placed on a frictionless horizontal table and spun with the same initial angular velocity, $\\omega_0$, about their vertical axis of symmetry. An observer then performs the following two-step procedure on each spinning object:\n1.  A brief frictional force is applied to the side of the object until its outer surface momentarily comes to rest.\n2.  The external force is immediately removed.\n\nFor the Solid object, it is observed that after the procedure, the object remains at rest. For the Fluid object, it is observed that after the procedure, the object begins to rotate again.\n\nSelect the statement that provides the most accurate physical explanation for the renewed rotation of the Fluid object.\n\nA. During the stop, the rotating fluid's kinetic energy is converted into elastic potential energy stored in the fluid. Upon release, this potential energy is converted back into the rotational kinetic energy of the whole object.\n\nB. The principle of conservation of angular momentum applies to the isolated Fluid object system. When the external force is removed, the object's moment of inertia, which was altered by the stopping of the shell, returns to its original value, forcing the object to rotate to conserve its non-zero angular momentum.\n\nC. The external force brings the shell to a stop, but the internal fluid continues to possess angular momentum due to its inertia. After the force is removed, internal viscous torques between the fluid and the shell transfer angular momentum from the fluid to the shell, causing the entire system to rotate again.\n\nD. According to the first law of thermodynamics, the initial rotational kinetic energy of the Fluid object cannot be destroyed. The energy is temporarily stored as thermal energy (heat) within the fluid and is then efficiently reconverted back into ordered rotational motion when the object is released.\n\nE. The external force is non-conservative, but the total mechanical energy of the fluid inside is conserved. The fluid continues to move and collides elastically with the inner wall of the shell, transferring momentum and causing the shell to rotate again.", "solution": "Let the shell have moment of inertia $I_{s}$ about the symmetry axis and the internal fluid have effective moment of inertia $I_{f}$ about the same axis. Let their angular velocities be $\\omega_{s}(t)$ and $\\omega_{f}(t)$, respectively.\n\nInitially, both the Solid and the Fluid objects are spun to the same angular velocity $\\omega_{0}$ about the vertical axis.

Denote the braking interval by $[0,t_{1}]$. During this interval, an external torque $\\tau_{\\text{ext}}(t)$ acts on the system; hence the total angular momentum of the shell+fluid is not conserved over $[0,t_{1}]$:\n$$\n\\frac{dL_{\\text{total}}}{dt}=\\tau_{\\text{ext}}(t)\\neq 0.\n$$\nBecause the shell is thin and directly acted upon, it is brought to $\\omega_{s}(t_{1})=0$.

Internal viscous torques between the fluid and the shell redistribute angular momentum while keeping the total $L$ constant. The shell is spun up while the fluid is spun down, until viscous coupling brings them to a common angular velocity $\\omega^{\\ast}$ with no slip:\n$$\nI_{s}\\omega^{\\ast}+I_{f}\\omega^{\\ast}=L(t_{1})\\approx I_{f}\\omega_{f}(t_{1})\n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad\n\\omega^{\\ast}=\\frac{I_{f}}{I_{s}+I_{f}}\\omega_{f}(t_{1}).\n$$\nSince $\\omega_{f}(t_{1})\\neq 0$, it follows that $\\omega^{\\ast}\\neq 0$ and the object starts rotating again after the external force is removed.

Statement A is incorrect because the fluid is (approximately) incompressible and the stopping is dissipative, not elastic. Statement B is incorrect because angular momentum is not conserved during the braking interval when an external torque acts; there is no forced rotation upon a supposed moment-of-inertia “return.” Statement D is incorrect because thermal energy generated by dissipation is not efficiently reconverted into ordered rotation; the post-release rotation comes from preexisting internal angular momentum, not from heat. Statement E is incorrect because total mechanical energy of the fluid is not conserved under viscous dissipation, and the interaction is not an elastic collision process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1891282"}]}
