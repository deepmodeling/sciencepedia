The bead has a uniform surface temperature $T$ and a surface emissivity of $\\epsilon$. It cools by losing heat to the surrounding air, which is at a constant ambient temperature $T_{amb}$. The two dominant heat transfer mechanisms are thermal radiation and natural convection. The rate of heat loss per unit surface area due to radiation is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. From experimental data, the rate of heat loss per unit surface area due to natural convection for this specific setup is found to be well-approximated by the empirical relation $q_{conv} = C(T - T_{amb})^{5/4}$, where $C$ is a constant determined by the properties of the air and the geometry of the setup.\n\nIn this analysis, you can assume that the surface temperature of the glass bead is significantly higher than the ambient temperature, such that $T \\gg T_{amb}$.\n\nDetermine the symbolic expression for the surface temperature $T$ of the glass bead at the precise moment when its rate of heat loss from radiation is equal to its rate of heat loss from natural convection.

Let's denote the heat loss rate per unit area for radiation as $q_{rad}$ and for convection as $q_{conv}$. The condition is $q_{rad} = q_{conv}$.\n\nFirst, we write down the expression for the radiative heat loss rate per unit area. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, this is given by:\n$$q_{rad} = \\epsilon \\sigma (T^4 - T_{amb}^4)$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the emissivity, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the surface temperature of the bead, and $T_{amb}$ is the ambient temperature.\n\nNext, we use the given empirical formula for the convective heat loss rate per unit area:\n$$q_{conv} = C(T - T_{amb})^{5/4}$$\nwhere $C$ is the given empirical constant.\n\nThe problem states that we can assume the surface temperature is much higher than the ambient temperature, i.e., $T \\gg T_{amb}$. We can use this approximation to simplify both expressions.\n\nFor the radiative heat loss, since $T \\gg T_{amb}$, it follows that $T^4 \\gg T_{amb}^4$. Therefore, we can approximate the expression $(T^4 - T_{amb}^4)$ by neglecting the $T_{amb}^4$ term:\n$$q_{rad} \\approx \\epsilon \\sigma T^4$$\n\nFor the convective heat loss, since $T \\gg T_{amb}$, we can approximate the term $(T - T_{amb})$ by neglecting the $T_{amb}$ term:\n$$q_{conv} \\approx C(T)^{5/4}$$\n\nNow, we can set the approximate rates of heat loss per unit area equal to each other, as required by the problem:\n$$\\epsilon \\sigma T^4 = C T^{5/4}$$\n\nOur goal is to solve this equation for $T$. We can rearrange the equation to isolate $T$. Assuming $T \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $T^{5/4}$:\n$$\\epsilon \\sigma \\frac{T^4}{T^{5/4}} = C$$\nUsing the law of exponents ($x^a / x^b = x^{a-b}$), we get:\n$$T^{4 - 5/4} = T^{16/4 - 5/4} = T^{11/4}$$\nSo the equation becomes:\n$$\\epsilon \\sigma T^{11/4} = C$$\n\nNow, we solve for $T^{11/4}$:\n$$T^{11/4} = \\frac{C}{\\epsilon \\sigma}$$\n\nFinally, to find $T$, we raise both sides of the equation to the power of $4/11$:\n$$\\left(T^{11/4}\\right)^{4/11} = \\left(\\frac{C}{\\epsilon \\sigma}\\right)^{4/11}$$\n$$T = \\left(\\frac{C}{\\epsilon \\sigma}\\right)^{4/11}$$\n\nThis is the symbolic expression for the surface temperature $T$ when the radiative and convective cooling rates are equal, under the given approximation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{C}{\\epsilon \\sigma}\\right)^{\\frac{4}{11}}}$$", "id": "1925496"}, {"introduction": "Having established how to find a crossover temperature, we now turn to a practical scenario involving a cryogenic substance.
