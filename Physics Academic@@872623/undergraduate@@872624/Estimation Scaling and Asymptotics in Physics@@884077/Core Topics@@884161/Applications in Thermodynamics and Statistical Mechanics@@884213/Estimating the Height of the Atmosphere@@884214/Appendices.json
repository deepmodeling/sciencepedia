Let's denote the height of this block as $H_{solid}$ and its base area as $A = 1 \\text{ m}^2$.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental principle connecting atmospheric pressure to the air column. The pressure $P_0$ at the base is caused by the gravitational force (weight) of the entire air column acting on the base area $A$. Let $M_{total}$ be the total mass of the air in the column.\n$$P_0 = \\frac{F_{gravity}}{A} = \\frac{M_{total} g}{A}$$\nFrom this, we can find the total mass of the air in the column:\n$$M_{total} = \\frac{P_0 A}{g}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of molecules, $N$, in this mass of air.
