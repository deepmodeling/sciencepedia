In the event of a total power failure at high altitude, the drone will fall and eventually reach a terminal velocity.

This problem challenges you to combine principles of wave mechanics with several interconnected geometric and mass scaling relationships to uncover a non-obvious power law, showcasing the true predictive power of scaling analysis [@problem_id:1923015].", "problem": "Consider a model for investigating the acoustic properties of spider silk. In this model, we study spiders of a particular species that are all geometrically similar but vary in size. This means that if one spider has a characteristic linear dimension $L_s$ (such as its leg length), any other spider of the same species will have all its corresponding linear dimensions scaled by the same factor. Consequently, the mass $m$ of a spider scales as $m \\propto L_s^3$.\n\nA spider is observed hanging vertically at rest from a single strand of its silk, called a dragline. The length of this dragline, $L$, is also found to scale directly with the spider's characteristic size, so $L \\propto L_s$. The spider produces silk from spinnerets whose size is proportional to the spider's overall body size. As a result, the radius $r$ of the silk dragline is also proportional to the spider's characteristic size, $r \\propto L_s$.\n\nAssume the silk has a uniform volume density $\\rho_{\\text{silk}}$ and the local acceleration due to gravity is $g$. If the spider were to pluck the dragline near its point of attachment to the spinneret, it would generate a transverse wave. We are interested in the fundamental frequency $f$ of the standing wave that could be established on this dragline.\n\nYour task is to determine the exponent $\\alpha$ in the scaling relationship $f \\propto m^\\alpha$, which describes how the fundamental frequency of the dragline vibration depends on the mass of the spider hanging from it.", "solution": "The fundamental frequency $f$ of a vibrating string of length $L$, tension $T$, and linear mass density $\\mu$ is given by the formula:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$$\n\nIn this scenario, the spider is hanging at rest. The tension $T$ in the dragline is equal to the spider's weight.\n$$T = mg$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the spider and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe linear mass density $\\mu$ is the mass per unit length of the silk. Given the volume density of silk $\\rho_{\\text{silk}}$ and the radius of the dragline $r$, the cross-sectional area is $A = \\pi r^2$. The linear mass density is then:\n$$\\mu = \\rho_{\\text{silk}} A = \\rho_{\\text{silk}} \\pi r^2$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $T$ and $\\mu$ into the frequency formula, we get:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{mg}{\\rho_{\\text{silk}} \\pi r^2}}$$\n\nWe are interested in the scaling relationship between $f$ and $m$. Let's analyze how each variable in the equation scales with the spider's mass $m$.
