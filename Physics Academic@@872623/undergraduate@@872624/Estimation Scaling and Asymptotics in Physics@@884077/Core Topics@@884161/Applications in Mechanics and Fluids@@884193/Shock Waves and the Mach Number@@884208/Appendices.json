A planar shock wave is driven into this material.

To solve this, we must use the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions, which express the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy across a shock front. For this problem, we only need the mass and momentum conservation equations.\n\nLet the state of the material ahead of the shock be denoted by subscript 0 (uncompressed) and the state behind the shock by subscript 1 (compressed). The shock wave propagates with velocity $U_s$ into the stationary material, which has initial density $\\rho_0$ and initial pressure $P_0$. The material behind the shock is set in motion with a particle velocity $u_p$, and has density $\\rho_1$ and pressure $P_1$.\n\nThe Rankine-Hugoniot momentum jump condition is:\n$$P_1 - P_0 = \\rho_0 U_s u_p$$\nWe are given that the initial ambient pressure is negligible, so we can set $P_0 = 0$. The pressure behind the shock must reach the critical transition pressure, so $P_1 = P_{trans}$. The momentum equation simplifies to:\n$$P_{trans} = \\rho_0 U_s u_p$$\n\nWe have two unknowns in this equation: the shock velocity $U_s$ and the particle velocity $u_p$. The problem provides a second equation, which is the empirical linear relation for the material's Hugoniot curve:\n$$U_s = c_0 + s u_p$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns. Our goal is to find $U_s$ and then calculate the Mach number $M = U_s / c_0$. We can solve this system by expressing one variable in terms of the other and substituting. It is convenient to express $u_p$ in terms of $U_s$ from the linear relation:\n$$s u_p = U_s - c_0 \\implies u_p = \\frac{U_s - c_0}{s}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $u_p$ into the simplified momentum equation:\n$$P_{trans} = \\rho_0 U_s \\left( \\frac{U_s - c_0}{s} \\right)$$\nRearranging this equation gives a quadratic equation for the shock velocity $U_s$:\n$$s P_{trans} = \\rho_0 U_s^2 - \\rho_0 c_0 U_s$$\n$$\\rho_0 U_s^2 - \\rho_0 c_0 U_s - s P_{trans} = 0$$\nThis is a standard quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ with $x = U_s$, $a = \\rho_0$, $b = -\\rho_0 c_0$, and $c = -s P_{trans}$.
