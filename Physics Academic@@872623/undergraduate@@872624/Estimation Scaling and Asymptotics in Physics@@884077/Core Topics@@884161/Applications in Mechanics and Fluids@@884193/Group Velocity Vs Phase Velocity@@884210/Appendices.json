These magnons can be understood as propagating spin waves. For magnons with low momentum, corresponding to long wavelengths, their dispersion relation is well-approximated by the equation $\\hbar \\omega = D k^2$. In this expression, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave, $k$ is the wave number, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $D$ is the spin-wave stiffness constant, a parameter that depends on the material's properties.\n\nA spin wave can be described by two distinct velocities: the phase velocity, $v_p$, which is the speed of a point of constant phase on a single-frequency wave, and the group velocity, $v_g$, which is the speed of the propagation of the overall envelope of a wave packet formed by a superposition of waves.\n\nBased on the given dispersion relation for low-momentum magnons, calculate the numerical value of the ratio $\\frac{v_g}{v_p}$.", "solution": "The problem provides the dispersion relation for low-momentum magnons in a ferromagnet:\n$$\n\\hbar \\omega = D k^2\n$$\nHere, $\\hbar$ and $D$ are constants.
