This exercise provides a concrete way to calculate this force in the context of a du Noüy ring tensiometer, a standard laboratory instrument for measuring surface tension, $\\gamma$. The key to this problem is to correctly identify the total length of the liquid film that pulls down on the ring as it is lifted from the surface [@problem_id:1936020].", "problem": "In a materials science laboratory, a du Noüy ring tensiometer is used to characterize the properties of a newly synthesized liquid. The device employs a thin, circular wire ring of mean radius $R$. The ring is initially placed flat on the surface of the liquid. A precision force sensor then pulls the ring vertically upwards at a very slow, constant speed. As the ring is lifted, it pulls a thin film of the liquid with it. The force required to pull the ring increases until it reaches a maximum value just before the film breaks and the ring detaches from the surface.\n\nAssume the ring remains perfectly horizontal throughout the process and the wire it is made from has a negligible cross-sectional radius. The liquid has a uniform surface tension $\\gamma$ and it perfectly wets the ring. Determine the maximum additional upward force $F_{max}$ that must be applied to the ring to detach it from the liquid, not including the force required to support the ring's own weight. Provide your answer as an analytic expression in terms of $R$ and $\\gamma$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum additional force required to detach a thin wire ring of radius $R$ from a liquid surface with surface tension $\\gamma$. This additional force is the force needed to overcome the downward pull exerted by the liquid's surface tension.\n\nThe force due to surface tension, $F_{\\gamma}$, acts along the line of contact between the liquid and the object. The magnitude of this force is given by the product of the surface tension coefficient, $\\gamma$, and the length of the contact line, $L$.\n$$F_{\\gamma} = \\gamma L$$\nThe maximum force occurs just before the ring detaches from the liquid surface. At this point, the thin film of liquid being pulled up by the ring is oriented vertically. Therefore, the surface tension force acts vertically downwards, opposing the upward pull.\n\nWe need to determine the total length of the contact line, $L$. Since the object is a thin ring, the liquid is in contact with both the inner circumference and the outer circumference of the ring.\n\nThe mean radius of the ring is given as $R$. Since the wire's cross-sectional radius is negligible, we can approximate both the inner and outer radii as $R$.\n\nThe length of the inner contact line is the inner circumference of the ring, which is $L_{inner} = 2\\pi R$.\nThe length of the outer contact line is the outer circumference of the ring, which is $L_{outer} = 2\\pi R$.\n\nThe total length of the contact line is the sum of the inner and outer lengths:\n$$L = L_{inner} + L_{outer} = 2\\pi R + 2\\pi R = 4\\pi R$$\nNow, we can calculate the total downward force exerted by surface tension on the ring:\n$$F_{\\gamma} = \\gamma L = \\gamma (4\\pi R)$$\nTo detach the ring, the upward applied force must overcome this downward surface tension force. The problem asks for the maximum additional force, $F_{max}$, which is equal in magnitude to the maximum surface tension force.\n$$F_{max} = F_{\\gamma}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $F_{\\gamma}$, we get:\n$$F_{max} = 4\\pi \\gamma R$$\nThis is the required force in addition to the force needed to counteract the weight of the ring itself.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4\\pi \\gamma R}$$", "id": "1936020"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of force, we now explore how surface tension gives rise to a pressure difference across any curved liquid interface. This pressure jump, governed by the Young-Laplace equation, is responsible for the very existence of bubbles and droplets. This practice problem demonstrates how to combine the pressure contribution from surface tension with the familiar hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding fluid, a scenario commonly encountered in both natural and industrial processes [@problem_id:1936021].", "problem": "In a process for manufacturing metallic foams, gas is bubbled through a molten metal precursor which then solidifies. To control the porosity and structure of the final material, it is crucial to understand the pressure required to form the bubbles.\n\nConsider a simplified model where a long, narrow tube is used to inject an inert gas into a large, open vat of a liquid precursor. The liquid has a constant density $\\rho$ and a surface tension $\\gamma$ at its interface with the gas. The circular opening of the tube is submerged to a depth $h$ below the undisturbed surface of the liquid. The gas is supplied slowly, allowing a single, stable spherical bubble of radius $R$ to form at the end of the tube.\n\nLet $g$ be the acceleration due to gravity.

Evaluating this at the tube opening, which is at depth $h$, we have $p_{\\text{liq}}=p_{\\text{liq}}(h)=p_{\\text{atm}}+\\rho g h$.

This exercise delves into such a competition by examining a liquid droplet, where surface tension works to maintain a spherical shape to minimize surface area, while gravity attempts to flatten it to lower its center of mass.
