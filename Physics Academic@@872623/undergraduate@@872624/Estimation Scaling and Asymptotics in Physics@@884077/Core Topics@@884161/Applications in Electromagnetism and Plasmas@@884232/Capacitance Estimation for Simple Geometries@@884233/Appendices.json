Your task is to discretize this problem using a uniform Cartesian grid and solve it with Gauss–Seidel relaxation, then estimate the capacitance from the numerical solution.

Subsequently, the capacitance per unit depth of the structure is to be estimated from the computed potential field.\n\nThe governing partial differential equation (PDE) for the electrostatic potential $\\phi(x,y)$ in a charge-free region with uniform permittivity is the Laplace equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = 0\n$$\nThe computational domain is a square $\\Omega = [0, W] \\times [0, H]$ where $W = 1\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $H = 1\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The boundary conditions are of the Dirichlet type. The potential is fixed at $\\phi = 0\\,\\mathrm{V}$ on the outer boundary of the square domain. Inside the domain, two parallel plate electrodes are present. The lower electrode, spanning from $x=0.2\\,\\mathrm{m}$ to $x=0.8\\,\\mathrm{m}$ at a height of $y=0.35\\,\\mathrm{m}$, is held at $\\phi = 0\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The upper electrode, spanning the same horizontal range at a height of $y=0.65\\,\\mathrm{m}$, is held at $\\phi = V_0 = 1\\,\\mathrm{V}$. These electrodes are treated as internal boundaries with fixed potential.\n\nTo solve this problem numerically, the continuous domain is discretized into a uniform grid of nodes. Let the grid have $N_x$ nodes in the $x$-direction and $N_y$ nodes in the $y$-direction. The coordinates of a grid node $(i,j)$ are given by $(x_i, y_j) = (i h_x, j h_y)$, for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N_x-1\\}$ and $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N_y-1\\}$. The grid spacings are $h_x = W / (N_x-1)$ and $h_y = H / (N_y-1)$. Since the problem specifies $W=H$ and $N_x=N_y$, we have a uniform square grid with $h_x = h_y = h$. The potential at a grid node $(i,j)$ is denoted by $\\phi_{i,j}$.\n\nThe Laplace operator is approximated using the standard second-order central finite-difference (5-point) stencil. At an interior node $(i,j)$, the PDE $\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\phi_{i+1,j} - 2\\phi_{i,j} + \\phi_{i-1,j}}{h^2} + \\frac{\\phi_{i,j+1} - 2\\phi_{i,j} + \\phi_{i,j-1}}{h^2} = 0\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\phi_{i+1,j} + \\phi_{i-1,j} + \\phi_{i,j+1} + \\phi_{i,j-1} - 4\\phi_{i,j} = 0\n$$\nThe Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative technique for solving this system of linear equations. By rearranging the equation, we obtain an update rule for $\\phi_{i,j}$:\n$$\n\\phi_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{4} (\\phi_{i+1,j} + \\phi_{i-1,j} + \\phi_{i,j+1} + \\phi_{i,j-1})\n$$\nIn the Gauss-Seidel algorithm, the potential at each non-fixed grid node is updated in-place during each sweep. For an iteration step $k \\to k+1$, assuming a row-by-row, column-by-column sweep, the update for $\\phi_{i,j}$ uses the most recently computed values:\n$$\n\\phi_{i,j}^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\phi_{i+1,j}^{(k)} + \\phi_{i-1,j}^{(k+1)} + \\phi_{i,j+1}^{(k)} + \\phi_{i,j-1}^{(k+1)}\\right)\n$$\nThis process is repeated for all interior grid points not subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. The algorithm begins by initializing the potential grid, typically to $\\phi_{i,j} = 0\\,\\mathrm{V}$ everywhere, and then setting the fixed potentials on the boundaries and electrodes. A boolean mask is used to identify these fixed nodes, ensuring they are not modified during the relaxation sweeps. The integer indices for the electrode locations are determined by finding the grid points closest to the specified physical coordinates. For a grid with spacing $h$, a physical coordinate $x_{\\mathrm{phys}}$ corresponds to index $i = \\mathrm{round}(x_{\\mathrm{phys}}/h)$.\n\nThe iterative process continues until a convergence criterion is met. After each full sweep, the maximum absolute change in potential across all updated nodes, $\\Delta_{\\max} = \\max_{i,j \\text{ not fixed}} |\\phi_{i,j}^{(k+1)} - \\phi_{i,j}^{(k)}|$, is computed. The iteration terminates if $\\Delta_{\\max} < \\tau$, where $\\tau = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is the specified tolerance, or if the number of sweeps reaches a maximum limit $N_{\\max} = 20000$.\n\nOnce the potential field $\\phi$ has converged, the capacitance per unit depth, $C$, is calculated. This is derived from the electrostatic energy $U$ stored in the system, given by the relation $U = \\frac{1}{2} C V_0^2$. The energy per unit depth is found by integrating the energy density over the area of the domain:\n$$\nU = \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla\\phi|^2 \\,dA = \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{2} \\int_0^H \\int_0^W \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right)^2 \\right] dx\\,dy\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_0 = 8.8541878128\\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$ is the vacuum permittivity. The integral is approximated numerically. First, the components of the electric field $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla\\phi$ are computed at each grid node using central differences:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right)_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{\\phi_{i+1,j} - \\phi_{i-1,j}}{2h}, \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right)_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{\\phi_{i,j+1} - \\phi_{i,j-1}}{2h}\n$$\nThese formulas are applied for interior nodes $i,j \\in [1, N-2]$. At the boundaries ($i=0, N-1$ or $j=0, N-1$), one-sided differences are used. The integral is then approximated by a sum over all grid nodes, where each node $(i,j)$ contributes the value of the integrand at that point multiplied by the area element $dA = h^2$:\n$$\nU \\approx \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{2} \\sum_{j=0}^{N_y-1} \\sum_{i=0}^{N_x-1} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right)_{i,j}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right)_{i,j}^2 \\right] h^2\n$$\nFinally, the capacitance per unit depth is calculated as:\n$$\nC = \\frac{2U}{V_0^2}\n$$\nSince $V_0=1\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is specified, this simplifies to $C=2U$. This entire procedure is repeated for each of the specified grid resolutions ($N_x=N_y=33, 65, 97$), and the resulting capacitance values are reported.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the 2D Laplace equation for a parallel-plate capacitor using Gauss-Seidel\n    relaxation and computes the capacitance for different grid resolutions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical and geometric constants\n    W = 1.0  # Domain width in meters\n    H = 1.0  # Domain height in meters\n    L = 0.6  # Electrode length in meters\n    X_START = 0.2 # Electrode start x-coordinate\n    X_END = 0.8   # Electrode end x-coordinate\n    Y_LOWER = 0.35 # Lower electrode y-coordinate\n    Y_UPPER = 0.65 # Upper electrode y-coordinate\n    V0 = 1.0  # Potential of the upper electrode in Volts\n    EPS0 = 8.8541878128e-12  # Vacuum permittivity in F/m\n\n    # Numerical parameters\n    TAU = 1e-5  # Convergence tolerance in Volts\n    N_MAX = 20000  # Maximum number of iterations\n\n    # Test cases for grid resolution (N x N grid)\n    test_cases = [33, 65, 97]\n    \n    results = []\n\n    for N in test_cases:\n        # 1.
