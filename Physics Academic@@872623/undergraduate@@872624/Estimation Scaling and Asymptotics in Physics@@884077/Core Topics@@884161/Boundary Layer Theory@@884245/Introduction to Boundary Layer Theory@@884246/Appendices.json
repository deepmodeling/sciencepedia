The fluid has a density $\\rho$, a kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, and approaches the plate with a free-stream velocity $U$. As the fluid passes over the plate, a thin layer forms near the surface where viscous effects are significant. By balancing the inertial and viscous forces acting on a fluid element within this layer, one can estimate how the layer's thickness, $\\delta(x)$, grows with distance $x$ from the leading edge of the plate. This, in turn, allows for an estimation of the total frictional drag force.\n\nYour task is to derive the functional dependence of the total viscous drag force, $F_D$, acting on one side of the plate, in terms of the given physical parameters.

The flow of blood in large arteries, driven by the pumping action of the heart, is pulsatile. This oscillatory motion creates a unique velocity profile near the arterial wall. We can model this situation by considering blood as an incompressible fluid with a kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, flowing in a long, straight tube. The flow is driven by an oscillating pressure gradient with a characteristic angular frequency $\\omega$, which is directly related to the heart rate.\n\nClose to the stationary wall of the artery, viscous effects become dominant and create a thin fluid region known as the oscillatory boundary layer, or Stokes layer. Within this layer, the fluid velocity rapidly changes from zero at the wall to its oscillatory value in the main flow.
