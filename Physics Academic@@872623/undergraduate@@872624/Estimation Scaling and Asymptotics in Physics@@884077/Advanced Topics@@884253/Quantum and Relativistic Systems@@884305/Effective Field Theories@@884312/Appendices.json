The process involves generating small droplets of a molten metal in a zero-gravity environment and allowing them to cool and solidify. For the bearings to be perfectly spherical, any oscillations of the liquid droplet must completely damp out before solidification occurs.\n\nTo analyze this process, we first need to understand the nature of these oscillations. Consider a single, incompressible spherical droplet of molten metal with an equilibrium radius $R$. If slightly perturbed, the droplet will oscillate around its spherical shape. The primary restoring force that drives the droplet back to its spherical form is surface tension, while the droplet's inertia resists this change. We can model this system using an effective theory where the physics is described by the relevant macroscopic parameters: the liquid's density $\\rho$ and its surface tension $\\gamma$. You may neglect the effects of gravity and viscosity.\n\nThe angular frequency, $\\omega$, of the fundamental (lowest-frequency) mode of oscillation will depend on these parameters.

It allows physicists to describe phenomena at a certain energy scale without needing to know the full details of the underlying physics at much higher energies. A classic example can be found in the study of electromagnetic waves.\n\nConsider a three-dimensional electromagnetic field propagating inside a long, straight, hollow waveguide. The waveguide is made of a perfect electrical conductor and has a square cross-section with an interior side length of $L$. The medium inside the waveguide is a vacuum with the speed of light denoted by $c$.\n\nFrom the perspective of a one-dimensional observer who can only make measurements along the central axis of the waveguide (the direction of propagation), the system can be described by an effective 1D theory. In this simplified model, the quantized transverse modes of the electromagnetic field behave like a collection of massive particles propagating in one dimension. The minimum energy required to excite the lowest-energy propagating mode is known as the \"mass gap\" of the effective theory. This energy gap corresponds to a minimum angular frequency, $\\omega_c$, called the cutoff frequency, below which no wave can propagate through the waveguide.\n\nYour task is to determine how this cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ for the lowest possible propagating mode scales with the side length $L$ of the waveguide.

By skillfully manipulating a set of given scaling laws within a simplified cosmological model, you will practice the kind of reasoning physicists use to guide the search for new fundamental particles.", "problem": "Consider a hypothetical elementary particle, denoted by $X$, which is a candidate for cosmic dark matter. In the early Universe, this particle was in thermal equilibrium, with its abundance governed by annihilation ($X + X \\to \\text{other particles}$) and creation processes. As the universe expanded and cooled, the particle's interaction rate, $\\Gamma_{ann}$, dropped below the Hubble expansion rate, $H$. This process, known as \"thermal freeze-out,\" occurred at a specific temperature $T_f$ and fixed the final relic abundance of the particle. The freeze-out condition is given by $\\Gamma_{ann}(T_f) \\approx H(T_f)$.\n\nFor this problem, use the following simplified model:\n1.  The annihilation rate is given by $\\Gamma_{ann} = n_X \\langle \\sigma_{ann}v \\rangle$, where $n_X$ is the number density of particle $X$ and $\\langle \\sigma_{ann}v \\rangle$ is its thermally averaged annihilation cross-section.\n2.  The final relic energy density of the particle, $\\rho_X$, which determines its contribution to the Universe's total energy budget today, is proportional to its mass $m_X$ and its number density-to-entropy ratio at freeze-out. This can be expressed as $\\rho_X \\propto m_X \\frac{n_X(T_f)}{s(T_f)}$, where $s(T_f)$ is the entropy density of the Universe at the freeze-out temperature.\n3.  We consider a non-standard cosmological history where, during the era of freeze-out, the Universe's expansion is driven by a non-relativistic matter-like component. In this scenario, the Hubble parameter scales with temperature as $H(T) \\propto T^{3/2}$.\n4.  The entropy of the Universe is, however, still dominated by relativistic particles, so the entropy density scales in the standard way: $s(T) \\propto T^3$.\n5.  Assume that, for a wide range of masses $m_X$, the freeze-out mechanism is such that the freeze-out temperature is directly proportional to the particle's mass, i.e., $T_f \\propto m_X$.\n\nThe observed relic abundance of dark matter is a specific, constant value.
