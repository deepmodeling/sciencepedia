An operator or coupling constant is defined as \"relevant\" if it becomes more dominant (i.e., its effective value grows) under this transformation. Conversely, it is \"irrelevant\" if it becomes less dominant (its effective value shrinks), and \"marginal\" if its effective value remains unchanged.\n\nBy performing a dimensional analysis on the action, first determine the mass dimension of the scalar field $\\phi$.
