Through careful experimentation near the critical temperature $T_c$, they have characterized the behavior of the system with two critical exponents.\n\nFirst, by measuring the spontaneous magnetization $M$ in the absence of an external magnetic field for temperatures $T  T_c$, they found that it scales with the reduced temperature $t = \\frac{T - T_c}{T_c}$ as $M \\propto (-t)^{\\beta}$. The experimentally determined value for the exponent is $\\beta = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nSecond, they measured the zero-field magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$, which is defined as the response of the magnetization to a small applied magnetic field. For $T > T_c$, they observed that the susceptibility diverges as the critical temperature is approached, following the relation $\\chi \\propto t^{-\\gamma}$. Their measurement yielded a value for the exponent $\\gamma = \\frac{7}{4}$.\n\nThe group's theoretical collaborators suggest that this system should be described by the scaling hypothesis.
