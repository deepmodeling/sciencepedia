This practice [@problem_id:1807180] focuses on quantifying this effect. Using a simplified but physically insightful geometric model, you will calculate the contraction of the first interlayer spacing based on a change in the nearest-neighbor bond length, demonstrating how local atomic interactions drive macroscopic changes in the surface structure.", "problem": "The surface of a crystal often has a different atomic arrangement compared to its bulk interior. One common phenomenon is surface relaxation, where the spacing between the outermost atomic layers changes. Consider a crystal with a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice structure, which is cleaved to expose a (100) surface. In the bulk of a BCC crystal, an atom is surrounded by its nearest neighbors at a specific, well-defined distance. After cleavage, the atoms on the new surface (the first layer) feel a different net force, causing them to adjust their positions. This relaxation causes the distance between an atom in the first layer and its nearest neighbor in the second layer (the layer directly beneath the surface) to decrease by 5.00% compared to the bulk nearest-neighbor distance.\n\nAssume a simplified model where the atoms do not move parallel to the surface plane; all relaxation occurs solely in the direction perpendicular to the surface. For a BCC crystal with lattice constant $a$, the unrelaxed, ideal spacing between adjacent (100) atomic planes is $a/2$.\n\nCalculate the fractional contraction of the first interlayer spacing. This is defined as the change in spacing between the first and second layers divided by the original, ideal spacing. Report your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the lattice constant of the Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) crystal be $a$. We can set up a coordinate system to describe the atomic positions. For the (100) surface, we can consider the planes to be perpendicular to the x-axis. By crystallographic symmetry, this is equivalent to the (001) surface, where planes are perpendicular to the z-axis. We will use the latter for convenience.\n\nThe first layer of atoms (the surface) can be placed at the $z=0$ plane. The positions of these atoms form a square lattice and can be written as $\\vec{r} = (ma, na, 0)$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers. Let's choose a reference atom in this layer at the origin, $\\vec{r}_1 = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\nIn a BCC structure, the next layer of atoms is located at the body-center positions relative to the first layer. In the ideal, unrelaxed crystal, this second layer would be at a depth of $z = -a/2$. The atoms in this second layer are at positions $\\vec{r} = ((m'+\\frac{1}{2})a, (n'+\\frac{1}{2})a, -a/2)$, where $m'$ and $n'$ are integers. The ideal interlayer spacing is therefore $d_{12}^{\\text{ideal}} = a/2$.\n\nNext, we identify the nearest neighbor to our reference atom $\\vec{r}_1$ that lies in the second layer. The squared distance between $\\vec{r}_1$ and an atom in the second layer is:\n$$D^2 = \\left( \\left(m'+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)a - 0 \\right)^2 + \\left( \\left(n'+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)a - 0 \\right)^2 + \\left( -\\frac{a}{2} - 0 \\right)^2$$\nThis distance is minimized when $m'$ and $n'$ are chosen to make the first two terms as small as possible. This occurs for $m', n' \\in \\{0, -1\\}$. For instance, choosing $m'=0$ and $n'=0$, we find a nearest-neighbor atom in the second layer at $\\vec{r}_2 = (a/2, a/2, -a/2)$.\n\nThe distance between these two atoms in the bulk (unrelaxed) configuration is the bulk nearest-neighbor distance, $D_{\\text{bulk}}$.\n$$D_{\\text{bulk}}^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3a^2}{4}$$\n$$D_{\\text{bulk}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}a}{2}$$\n\nThe problem states that due to surface relaxation, this distance shortens by 5.00%. Let $\\delta = 0.0500$. The new, relaxed distance is:\n$$D_{\\text{relaxed}} = (1-\\delta)D_{\\text{bulk}} = (1 - 0.0500) \\frac{\\sqrt{3}a}{2} = 0.9500 \\frac{\\sqrt{3}a}{2}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that relaxation occurs only perpendicular to the surface. This means the in-plane coordinates $(x, y)$ of the atoms do not change. The position of our surface atom remains $\\vec{r}_1' = (0, 0, 0)$. The position of the subsurface nearest neighbor changes only in its z-coordinate. Let the new, relaxed interlayer spacing be $d_{12}^{\\text{relaxed}}$. The new position of the subsurface atom is $\\vec{r}_2' = (a/2, a/2, -d_{12}^{\\text{relaxed}})$.\n\nThe squared distance between these atoms in the relaxed configuration can be expressed using their new coordinates:\n$$D_{\\text{relaxed}}^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + (-d_{12}^{\\text{relaxed}})^2 = \\frac{a^2}{2} + (d_{12}^{\\text{relaxed}})^2$$\n\nNow we equate the two expressions for $D_{\\text{relaxed}}^2$:\n$$\\left(0.9500 \\frac{\\sqrt{3}a}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a^2}{2} + (d_{12}^{\\text{relaxed}})^2$$\n$$(0.9500)^2 \\frac{3a^2}{4} = \\frac{2a^2}{4} + (d_{12}^{\\text{relaxed}})^2$$\n\nWe can solve for $(d_{12}^{\\text{relaxed}})^2$:\n$$(d_{12}^{\\text{relaxed}})^2 = (0.9500)^2 \\frac{3a^2}{4} - \\frac{2a^2}{4} = \\frac{a^2}{4} \\left( 3(0.9500)^2 - 2 \\right)$$\n$$d_{12}^{\\text{relaxed}} = \\frac{a}{2} \\sqrt{3(0.9500)^2 - 2}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional contraction, $C$, of the interlayer spacing, defined as $C = (d_{12}^{\\text{ideal}} - d_{12}^{\\text{relaxed}}) / d_{12}^{\\text{ideal}}$.\n$$C = \\frac{a/2 - d_{12}^{\\text{relaxed}}}{a/2} = 1 - \\frac{d_{12}^{\\text{relaxed}}}{a/2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $d_{12}^{\\text{relaxed}}$:\n$$C = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{a}{2} \\sqrt{3(0.9500)^2 - 2}}{a/2} = 1 - \\sqrt{3(0.9500)^2 - 2}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$C = 1 - \\sqrt{3(0.9025) - 2} = 1 - \\sqrt{2.7075 - 2} = 1 - \\sqrt{0.7075}$$\n$$C \\approx 1 - 0.84113019... = 0.1588698...$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$C \\approx 0.159$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.159}$$", "id": "1807180"}]}
