This problem explores the Seebeck effect at a conceptual level, using the well-understood properties of p-type and n-type semiconductors to construct a simple generator [@problem_id:1824878]. Determining the direction of current flow is the foundational step in designing and analyzing any thermoelectric circuit, linking microscopic charge carrier behavior to the macroscopic voltage produced.", "problem": "A simple thermoelectric generator is constructed using a p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor. The two materials are joined together at one end to form a junction. This junction is maintained at a high temperature, $T_H$. The opposite, free ends of the semiconductor legs are kept at a lower ambient temperature, $T_C$, where $T_C  T_H$. An external load resistor, $R_L$, is connected between these two free ends, completing an electrical circuit.\n\nThis temperature difference across the semiconductor legs generates a voltage via the Seebeck effect, driving a current through the load resistor. Assuming the device operates as an ideal thermoelectric generator, what is the direction of the conventional current flow through the external load resistor $R_L$?\n\nA. From the free end of the p-type material, through the resistor, to the free end of the n-type material.\n\nB. From the free end of the n-type material, through the resistor, to the free end of the p-type material.\n\nC. No net current flows because the thermoelectric voltages generated in the p-type and n-type legs are equal and opposite, cancelling each other out.\n\nD. The current rapidly oscillates, with its direction switching back and forth between the p-type and n-type terminals.", "solution": "Let the p-type and n-type legs be joined at the hot junction at temperature $T_{H}$ and have their free ends at the cold temperature $T_{C}$, with $T_{C}T_{H}$. The Seebeck relation in each leg (open-circuit thermoelectric field) is\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}=S\\,\\nabla T,\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the Seebeck coefficient. For p-type material, $S_{p}0$; for n-type material, $S_{n}0$.\n\nChoose a coordinate $x$ increasing from the hot end to the cold end, so $\\frac{dT}{dx}0$. Then:\n- In the p-type leg: $E_{p}=S_{p}\\frac{dT}{dx}0$, so $\\mathbf{E}$ points from cold to hot. Using $E=-\\frac{dV}{dx}$, this implies $\\frac{dV}{dx}0$, hence $V_{\\text{cold},p}V_{\\text{hot}}$.\n- In the n-type leg: $E_{n}=S_{n}\\frac{dT}{dx}0$, so $\\mathbf{E}$ points from hot to cold. Then $\\frac{dV}{dx}0$, hence $V_{\\text{cold},n}V_{\\text{hot}}$.\n\nEquivalently, integrating $dV=-E\\,dx=-S\\,dT$ gives\n$$\nV_{\\text{cold}}-V_{\\text{hot}}=-\\int_{T_{H}}^{T_{C}}S(T)\\,dT.\n$$\nWith $S_{p}0$ this is positive for the p-leg, and with $S_{n}0$ it is negative for the n-leg. Since the hot ends are shorted together, $V_{\\text{hot},p}=V_{\\text{hot},n}$, so the cold-end potential difference is\n$$\nV_{\\text{cold},p}-V_{\\text{cold},n}=-\\int_{T_{H}}^{T_{C}}\\bigl(S_{p}-S_{n}\\bigr)\\,dT.\n$$\nFor temperature-independent $S$, this becomes\n$$\nV_{\\text{cold},p}-V_{\\text{cold},n}=(S_{p}-S_{n})(T_{H}-T_{C})0,\n$$\nbecause $S_{p}-S_{n}0$ and $T_{H}-T_{C}0$. Therefore the cold end of the p-type leg is at a higher electric potential than the cold end of the n-type leg.\n\nConventional current through the external load resistor $R_{L}$ flows from higher to lower potential, i.e., from the free end of the p-type material to the free end of the n-type material. This corresponds to option A. Options C and D are incorrect because the net emf is $(S_{p}-S_{n})(T_{H}-T_{C})\\neq 0$ for $S_{p}\\neq S_{n}$ and the operation is steady (DC), not oscillatory.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1824878"}, {"introduction": "Having explored power generation, we now turn to active cooling, which relies on the Peltier effect.
