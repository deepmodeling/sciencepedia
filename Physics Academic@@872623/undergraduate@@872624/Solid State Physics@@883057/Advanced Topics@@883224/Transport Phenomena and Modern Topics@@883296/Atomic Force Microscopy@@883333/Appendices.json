An infinitely sharp tip would yield a perfect image, but real probes have finite dimensions, leading to artifacts that can broaden or distort features. This exercise [@problem_id:1761852] uses a simplified geometric model to demonstrate this \"tip convolution\" effect, providing essential insight into how to critically interpret AFM data and understand its inherent limitations.", "problem": "An Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) creates a topographical map of a surface by scanning a sharp probe, or tip, across it. In an idealized scenario with an infinitely sharp tip, the AFM image would be a perfect replica of the surface. However, real tips have a finite size, which leads to a well-known imaging artifact called \"tip convolution,\" where sharp features on the surface appear broadened in the AFM image.\n\nConsider a simplified two-dimensional model of this phenomenon. A tip with a perfect hemispherical shape of radius $R = 20.0 \\text{ nm}$ is used to scan a surface. The surface consists of a perfectly flat substrate that ends in a sharp, vertical step of height $h = 5.00 \\text{ nm}$. For coordinates $(x, z)$, the surface can be described as being at height $z=0$ for $x<0$, and at height $z=h$ for $x \\ge 0$, with a vertical wall at $x=0$. Assume the condition $h  R$ holds.\n\nAs the tip scans from left to right ($x  0$ towards $x  0$), its vertical position is adjusted so that it remains in contact with the surface without penetrating it. The resulting AFM image is the path traced by the apex (the lowest point) of the tip. Due to the tip's shape, the measured profile will show a gradual transition from the lower level to the upper level, rather than an instantaneous jump. The \"apparent width\" of the step is defined as the horizontal distance over which the measured height of the tip's apex transitions from the lower surface level to the upper surface level.\n\nCalculate the apparent width of the step as measured by the AFM.

The experiment measures the force on the AFM cantilever as a function of the tip-substrate separation distance, $z$. The process begins with the tip far from the surface, where the force is zero. The tip approaches the surface, makes contact at $z=0$, and is then retracted.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, we will use a simplified linear model for the retraction phase, which determines the adhesive interaction.\n1.  The approach path is idealized: the interaction force is zero until contact, i.e., $F_{approach}(z) = 0$ for all $z > 0$.\n2.  The retraction path begins from $z=0$ with $F=0$. As the tip is pulled away from the surface (increasing $z$), an attractive adhesive force develops. This force is observed to be linearly proportional to the separation distance, $z$.\n3.  The adhesive force reaches its maximum magnitude (a minimum value, since it's attractive) at a specific separation distance, known as the rupture distance, $z_{rup}$. At this point, the adhesive bond breaks.\n4.  The minimum force recorded just before the bond breaks is the pull-off force, $F_{\\text{pull-off}} = -420.0 \\text{ pN}$. This occurs at the rupture distance $z_{\\text{rup}} = 8.50 \\text{ nm}$.\n5.
