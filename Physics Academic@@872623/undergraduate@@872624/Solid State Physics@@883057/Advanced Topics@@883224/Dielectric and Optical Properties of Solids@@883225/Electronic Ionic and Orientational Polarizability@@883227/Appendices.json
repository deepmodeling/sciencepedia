When an external uniform electric field with magnitude $E$ is applied, the electron is displaced by a distance $x$ from its equilibrium position relative to the nucleus. This displacement creates an induced electric dipole moment with magnitude $p$. It is assumed that the restoring force that pulls the electron back towards the nucleus obeys Hooke's Law, $F_{restore} = -kx$, where $k$ is an effective restoring force constant.

The electric field exerts a force on the electron, which has a charge of $-e$. The magnitude of this electric force is:\n$$F_{elec} = |-e| E = eE$$\n\nThis electric force causes the electron to be displaced from its equilibrium position. According to the model, this displacement is opposed by a Hooke's Law restoring force:\n$$F_{restore} = kx$$\nwhere $x$ is the magnitude of the displacement.\n\nThe electron will settle at a new equilibrium position where the electric force is perfectly balanced by the restoring force. Therefore, we can set the magnitudes of the two forces equal to each other:\n$$F_{elec} = F_{restore}$$\n$$eE = kx$$\n\nFrom this equilibrium condition, we can solve for the displacement $x$:\n$$x = \\frac{eE}{k}$$\n\nThe displacement of the electron of charge $-e$ relative to the stationary nucleus creates an induced electric dipole. The magnitude of this induced dipole moment, $p$, is the product of the magnitude of the charge and the separation distance:\n$$p = ex$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for the displacement $x$ into the equation for the dipole moment $p$:\n$$p = e \\left(\\frac{eE}{k}\\right) = \\frac{e^2}{k} E$$\n\nThe problem statement provides the definition of electronic polarizability, $\\alpha_e$, as $p = \\alpha_e E$. By comparing our derived expression for $p$ with this definition, we can establish a relationship between $\\alpha_e$, $e$, and $k$:\n$$\\frac{e^2}{k} E = \\alpha_e E$$\nBy canceling the electric field $E$ from both sides, we get:\n$$\\alpha_e = \\frac{e^2}{k}$$\n\nOur goal is to find the restoring force constant $k$. We can rearrange the above equation to solve for $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{e^2}{\\alpha_e}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this expression.

The unit is $\\frac{\\text{C}^2 \\cdot \\text{V}}{\\text{C} \\cdot \\text{m}^2} = \\frac{\\text{C} \\cdot \\text{V}}{\\text{m}^2}$.
