The permanent magnet must provide a stable magnetic field and be highly resistant to demagnetization from external fields and temperature fluctuations. The inductor core must be able to be magnetized and demagnetized rapidly with minimal energy dissipation (hysteresis loss) to ensure efficient operation of the satellite's power regulation system.\n\nThe team has narrowed the choice to two ferromagnetic materials, Material Alpha and Material Beta. Their magnetic properties at the intended operating temperature are listed below:\n\n| Material | Coercivity ($H_c$) | Remanent Flux Density ($B_r$) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Material Alpha | $8.0 \\times 10^2$ A/m | 1.5 T |\n| Material Beta | $9.8 \\times 10^5$ A/m | 1.4 T |\n\nTo quantify the suitability of a material for a specific role, the team uses simplified figures of merit.

This application calls for a \"hard\" magnetic material, which is characterized by a high coercivity ($H_c$) and a high remanent flux density ($B_r$). High coercivity means a large external magnetic field is needed to demagnetize the material.\n\nAn inductor core that is rapidly cycled needs to be easily magnetized and demagnetized to minimize energy lost as heat during each cycle. This energy loss is related to the area of the material's magnetic hysteresis loop.

The answer often lies in their microscopic structure. This exercise [@problem_id:1802623] moves beyond macroscopic properties to explore the physical origins of magnetic hardness, focusing on how microstructural features like grain boundaries can impede the movement of magnetic domain walls. Understanding this connection between microstructure and magnetic behavior is key to designing new materials with tailored properties.", "problem": "An engineer is tasked with designing a material for a high-performance permanent magnet, where high coercivity ($H_c$) is a primary design goal. Coercivity measures the resistance of a ferromagnetic material to becoming demagnetized by an external magnetic field. Two samples of the same iron-boron-neodymium alloy are prepared using different fabrication methods.\n\nSample A is produced by a conventional casting and annealing process, resulting in a polycrystalline structure with a large average grain diameter of approximately $50$ micrometers.\n\nSample B is produced using a rapid solidification technique, which creates a nanocrystalline structure with a much smaller average grain diameter of approximately $25$ nanometers.\n\nIn this alloy and for this range of grain sizes, the dominant mechanism controlling coercivity is the pinning of magnetic domain walls at grain boundaries. The grain boundaries act as energetic barriers that impede the motion of the domain walls. Based on this information, which sample is expected to have a higher coercivity, and what is the underlying physical reason?\n\nA. Sample A (large grains), because larger grains can support larger and more stable magnetic domains, which are inherently more difficult to reorient.\nB. Sample A (large grains), because the lower density of grain boundaries reduces the total pinning energy, making the overall magnetic state more resistant to change.\nC. Sample B (nanocrystalline), because the much higher surface area to volume ratio of the grains leads to a significantly greater density of grain boundary pinning sites.\nD. Sample B (nanocrystalline), because the small grain size leads to single-domain particles, and reversing the magnetization requires coherent rotation, which is an energetically costly process.\nE. Both samples will have nearly identical coercivity, because coercivity is an intrinsic property determined by the alloy's chemical composition, not its microstructure.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which of two samples of the same alloy, one with large grains and one with nanocrystalline grains, will have a higher coercivity, given that the dominant mechanism is the pinning of magnetic domain walls at grain boundaries.\n\nFirst, let's understand the key concepts.\n1.  **Ferromagnetism and Magnetic Domains**: In a ferromagnetic material below its Curie temperature, atomic magnetic moments spontaneously align in regions called magnetic domains. Within each domain, the magnetization is uniform and saturated. The direction of magnetization, however, varies from one domain to another.\n2.  **Domain Walls**: The transition region between two adjacent domains with different magnetization directions is called a domain wall.\n3.  **Magnetization and Demagnetization**: When an external magnetic field is applied, domains aligned favorably with the field grow at the expense of others. This occurs through the movement of domain walls. Coercivity ($H_c$) is the intensity of the applied magnetic field required to reduce the magnetization of a material to zero after it has reached saturation. A high coercivity means the material strongly resists demagnetization and is thus a \"hard\" magnetic material, suitable for permanent magnets.\n4.  **Domain Wall Pinning**: The motion of domain walls is not frictionless. Imperfections in the crystal lattice, such as vacancies, dislocations, impurities, and critically, grain boundaries, can act as \"pinning sites.\" A domain wall is energetically more stable when located at such a defect. To move a domain wall away from a pinning site, energy must be supplied by the external magnetic field.\n\nThe problem states that the dominant mechanism for coercivity is domain wall pinning at grain boundaries. Grain boundaries are the interfaces between adjacent crystal grains in a polycrystalline material. They represent a disruption of the perfect crystal lattice and are thus high-energy regions where a domain wall can be pinned.\n\nNow, let's compare Sample A and Sample B.\n- Sample A has large grains (average diameter $\\approx 50 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$).\n- Sample B has nanocrystalline grains (average diameter $\\approx 25 \\, \\text{nm}$).\n\nThe key difference is the total amount of grain boundary area within a given volume of the material. For a fixed total volume $V$, if we model the grains as cubes of side length $D$, the number of grains is approximately $N \\approx V/D^3$. The surface area of one grain is approximately $6D^2$. The total grain boundary area in the material is roughly proportional to the total surface area of all grains, which is $A_{total} \\propto N \\times (\\text{surface area of one grain}) \\propto (V/D^3) \\times D^2 = V/D$.\n\nTherefore, the total grain boundary area, or the density of grain boundaries, is inversely proportional to the average grain size $D$.\n$$ \\text{Grain Boundary Density} \\propto \\frac{1}{D} $$\n\nSample B has a much smaller grain size $D$ than Sample A ($25 \\times 10^{-9}$ m vs. $50 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). This means Sample B has a tremendously higher density of grain boundaries. Since each grain boundary can act as a pinning site for domain walls, Sample B contains a far greater number of pinning sites per unit volume than Sample A.\n\nWhen an external demagnetizing field is applied, the domain walls must move. In Sample B, the walls are constantly encountering pinning sites (the dense network of grain boundaries), which strongly impede their motion. A much larger magnetic field is required to provide the energy to overcome this widespread pinning. This directly translates to a much higher coercivity ($H_c$) for Sample B.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n-   A: Incorrect. While large grains can support large domains, this does not intrinsically lead to high coercivity. In fact, easy domain wall motion in large, clean grains leads to low coercivity (magnetically soft materials).\n-   B: Incorrect reasoning. A lower density of grain boundaries means fewer pinning sites, leading to *easier* domain wall motion and thus *lower* coercivity.\n-   C: Correct. The nanocrystalline structure has a very high density of grain boundaries due to the small grain size (high surface area to volume ratio). These boundaries act as numerous pinning sites, impeding domain wall motion and resulting in high coercivity.\n-   D: Incorrect for this problem. While the transition to single-domain behavior at very small particle sizes *can* lead to high coercivity through a different mechanism (coherent rotation), the problem explicitly states that domain wall pinning is the dominant mechanism. This option describes a different physical regime that is not the basis for the comparison here.\n-   E: Incorrect. Coercivity is an *extrinsic* property, meaning it is highly sensitive to the material's microstructure (grain size, defects, internal stress) in addition to its intrinsic composition.\n\nTherefore, the nanocrystalline sample (Sample B) will have a higher coercivity due to the high density of grain boundaries acting as pinning sites.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1802623"}]}
