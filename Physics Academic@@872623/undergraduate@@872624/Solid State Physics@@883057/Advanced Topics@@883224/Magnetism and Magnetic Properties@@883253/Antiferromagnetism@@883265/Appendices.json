Ferromagnetic within each $(001)$ plane and antiferromagnetically stacked along $[001]$ corresponds to A-type AFM. In this case, in-plane nearest neighbors are parallel while neighbors along $[001]$ are antiparallel, so not all six nearest neighbors are antiparallel. This does not satisfy G-type.\n\nB. Ferromagnetic chains along $[001]$ with antiferromagnetic arrangement between chains in the $(001)$ plane corresponds to C-type AFM. Here, neighbors along $[001]$ are parallel and in-plane neighbors are antiparallel, so again not all six are antiparallel. This is not G-type.\n\nC. Antiferromagnetic within each $(001)$ plane (checkerboard) and stacked ferromagnetically along $[001]$ yields antiparallel in-plane neighbors but parallel neighbors along $[001]$, thus not all six are antiparallel.
