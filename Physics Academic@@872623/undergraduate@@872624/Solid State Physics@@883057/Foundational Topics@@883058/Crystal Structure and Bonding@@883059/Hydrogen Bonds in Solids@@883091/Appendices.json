This exercise uses salicylic acid as a practical example to distinguish between intramolecular bonds, which occur within a single molecule, and intermolecular bonds, which form between different molecules. Mastering this distinction is a key first step in predicting how molecules will arrange themselves in a crystal.", "problem": "Salicylic acid, with the chemical formula $C_7H_6O_3$, is a molecule of significant interest in materials science and pharmacology. Its structure consists of a planar benzene ring to which a carboxylic acid group ($-COOH$) and a hydroxyl group ($-OH$) are attached. Crucially, these two functional groups are located on adjacent carbon atoms of the ring (the *ortho* position). In the solid state, salicylic acid molecules arrange into a crystalline lattice stabilized primarily by hydrogen bonds. A hydrogen bond is an electrostatic attraction between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (a donor) and another nearby electronegative atom (an acceptor).\n\nConsidering the specific geometry and the functional groups present in a salicylic acid molecule, which of the following statements most accurately describes the hydrogen bonding scheme within its solid crystal structure?\n\nA. The crystal is stabilized by a network of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, where the hydrogen atom of a hydroxyl group on one molecule bonds to the oxygen atom of a hydroxyl group on a neighboring molecule.\n\nB. The structure is dominated by a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond formed between the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid group and the oxygen of the hydroxyl group. This internal bond is so strong that it prevents the formation of any significant intermolecular hydrogen bonds.\n\nC. Each molecule contains one intramolecular hydrogen bond between the hydrogen of its hydroxyl group and the oxygen of its carbonyl group (C=O). These molecules then pair up to form dimers via two intermolecular hydrogen bonds between their respective carboxylic acid groups.\n\nD. The only hydrogen bonds that form are intermolecular, creating long polymer-like chains where the carboxylic acid group of one molecule links to the hydroxyl group of the next molecule in the chain.\n\nE. The proximity of the bulky carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the formation of any hydrogen bonds. The solid is held together solely by weaker van der Waals forces.", "solution": "Identify hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors in salicylic acid. The carboxylic acid group contains one strong donor, the $O-H$ of $-COOH$, and one strong acceptor, the carbonyl oxygen of $C=O$. The phenolic hydroxyl group $-OH$ on the ring is a good donor and a weaker acceptor; among available acceptors, the carbonyl oxygen is the strongest.\n\nUse the ortho geometry to assess intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Because the phenolic $-OH$ is adjacent to the carboxyl group, it can form a six-membered-ring intramolecular hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen, best described as $O-H_{\\text{phenol}}\\cdots O_{\\text{carbonyl}}$. This intramolecular interaction is well known for ortho-hydroxybenzoic derivatives and is favored by both proximity and the high basicity of the carbonyl oxygen.\n\nEvaluate dominant intermolecular hydrogen-bond patterns for carboxylic acids in the solid state. Carboxylic acids characteristically assemble via two reciprocal $O-H\\cdots O$ hydrogen bonds between their $-COOH$ groups to form centrosymmetric dimers. This dimerization motif is robust and commonly persists even when other intramolecular hydrogen bonds are present elsewhere in the molecule.\n\nAssess compatibility of these two features. The intramolecular $O-H_{\\text{phenol}}\\cdots O_{\\text{carbonyl}}$ hydrogen bond can coexist with the usual carboxylic-acid dimerization, in which the $-COOH$ groups of two molecules form two intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Thus, each molecule contains one intramolecular hydrogen bond (phenolic donor to carbonyl acceptor) and participates in a carboxylic-acid dimer through its $-COOH$ group.\n\nExclude the other options:\n- Option A incorrectly emphasizes hydroxyl–hydroxyl intermolecular bonding; phenolic oxygens are weaker acceptors, and carboxylic-acid dimerization is the dominant pattern.\n- Option B overstates the strength of an intramolecular hydrogen bond from the carboxyl hydrogen to the phenolic oxygen and incorrectly asserts that it prevents significant intermolecular bonding; moreover, the prevalent intramolecular bond runs from the phenolic $O-H$ to the carbonyl oxygen, not the reverse.\n- Option D proposes chains linking carboxyl groups to phenolic hydroxyls; this is not the characteristic motif for carboxylic acids and neglects the strong intramolecular bond described above.\n- Option E is incorrect because salicylic acid is well known to engage in hydrogen bonding.\n\nTherefore, the description that best matches the known hydrogen-bonding scheme is that each molecule has one intramolecular phenolic-to-carbonyl hydrogen bond and the molecules form carboxylic-acid dimers via two intermolecular hydrogen bonds between their $-COOH$ groups, which corresponds to Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1782833"}, {"introduction": "While we often picture hydrogen bonds as simple one-to-one links, the reality in solids can be more complex. This practice problem moves from simple identification to quantitative analysis by introducing the concept of a 'bifurcated' hydrogen bond, where one atom accepts bonds from multiple donors.

The angle formed by the donor, hydrogen, and acceptor, $\\angle(D-H-A)$, is greater than 110°.\n\nBased on these criteria and the provided atomic coordinates, which of the following statements best describes the hydrogen bonding environment of the acceptor oxygen atom, `O_A`?\n\nA. `O_A` forms a strong hydrogen bond with the `O_D1-H1` group, but the `O_D2-H2` group is too far away to form a hydrogen bond.\n\nB. `O_A` simultaneously accepts two distinct hydrogen bonds, one from the `O_D1-H1` group and another from the `O_D2-H2` group.\n\nC. `O_A` does not form any hydrogen bonds with either group because the distances and angles do not meet the required criteria.\n\nD. `O_A` acts as a hydrogen bond donor, forming bonds with both `O_D1` and `O_D2` which act as acceptors.\n\nE. `O_A` forms a weak hydrogen bond only with the `O_D2-H2` group, while the geometry with the `O_D1-H1` group is unfavorable.", "solution": "We apply the standard geometric criteria using the given Cartesian coordinates.
