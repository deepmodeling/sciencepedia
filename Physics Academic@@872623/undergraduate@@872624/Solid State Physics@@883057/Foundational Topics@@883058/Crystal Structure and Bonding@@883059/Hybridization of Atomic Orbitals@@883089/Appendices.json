This exercise [@problem_id:1782606] will guide you in connecting the distinct atomic geometries of these two structures to the specific hybridization states of the boron and nitrogen atoms, revealing how microscopic bonding dictates macroscopic material characteristics.", "problem": "Boron nitride is a material that exists in several crystalline forms, or allotropes, with distinct physical properties. Two of the most important forms are hexagonal Boron Nitride ($h$-BN) and cubic Boron Nitride ($c$-BN).\n\nIn the hexagonal form, often called \"white graphite,\" the boron and nitrogen atoms are arranged in a planar, two-dimensional sheet-like structure. Within each sheet, every boron atom is covalently bonded to three neighboring nitrogen atoms, and every nitrogen atom is bonded to three neighboring boron atoms, forming a honeycomb lattice.\n\nIn the cubic form, which possesses a zincblende crystal structure analogous to diamond, the atoms form a three-dimensional network. In this structure, every boron atom is tetrahedrally coordinated and bonded to four neighboring nitrogen atoms, and conversely, every nitrogen atom is tetrahedrally coordinated and bonded to four neighboring boron atoms.\n\nBased on the principles of orbital hybridization, which of the following statements correctly identifies the hybridization states of the boron (B) and nitrogen (N) atoms in these two allotropes?\n\nA. $h$-BN: B($sp^3$), N($sp^3$); $c$-BN: B($sp^2$), N($sp^2$)\n\nB. $h$-BN: B($sp^2$), N($sp^3$); $c$-BN: B($sp^3$), N($sp^2$)\n\nC. $h$-BN: B($sp$), N($sp$); $c$-BN: B($sp^2$), N($sp^2$)\n\nD. $h$-BN: B($sp^2$), N($sp^2$); $c$-BN: B($sp^3$), N($sp^3$)\n\nE. $h$-BN: B($sp^3$), N($sp^2$); $c$-BN: B($sp^2$), N($sp^3$)", "solution": "The hybridization of an atom in a molecule or a solid is determined by its local bonding geometry. This is because atomic orbitals (like $s$ and $p$) mix to form a new set of degenerate hybrid orbitals that point towards the bonded atoms, maximizing orbital overlap and forming stronger bonds. The number and orientation of these hybrid orbitals must match the observed geometry.\n\nFirst, let's analyze hexagonal Boron Nitride ($h$-BN). The problem states that the structure is planar and that each atom (both boron and nitrogen) is bonded to three other atoms. A planar geometry where a central atom is bonded to three other atoms is known as trigonal planar geometry. To form three equivalent bonds in a plane, oriented at approximately $120^\\circ$ to each other, an atom must mix one $s$ orbital and two $p$ orbitals. This process results in three $sp^2$ hybrid orbitals. Therefore, for both the boron and the nitrogen atoms in $h$-BN to achieve the described trigonal planar bonding, they must both adopt $sp^2$ hybridization. The remaining unhybridized $p_z$ orbital on each atom is oriented perpendicular to the planar sheet and participates in pi-bonding, which contributes to the stability of the layered structure. For boron (3 valence electrons), all three valence electrons occupy the three $sp^2$ orbitals to form three sigma bonds. For nitrogen (5 valence electrons), three electrons occupy the $sp^2$ orbitals to form sigma bonds, and the remaining two electrons occupy the unhybridized $p_z$ orbital, participating in the delocalized pi system.\n\nNext, we analyze cubic Boron Nitride ($c$-BN). The problem describes a structure where each atom (both boron and nitrogen) is tetrahedrally coordinated, meaning it is bonded to four other atoms arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron. A tetrahedral geometry requires the central atom to form four equivalent bonds. This is achieved by mixing one $s$ orbital and three $p$ orbitals, which results in four equivalent $sp^3$ hybrid orbitals. These four orbitals are oriented towards the vertices of a tetrahedron, with bond angles of approximately $109.5^\\circ$. Since both boron and nitrogen atoms are described as being tetrahedrally coordinated, both must adopt $sp^3$ hybridization to form the network of four single bonds per atom.\n\nIn summary:\n- In $h$-BN, the planar, three-coordinate geometry dictates $sp^2$ hybridization for both B and N atoms.\n- In $c$-BN, the tetrahedral, four-coordinate geometry dictates $sp^3$ hybridization for both B and N atoms.\n\nComparing our findings with the given choices:\n- A. Incorrect. Swaps the hybridizations for the two structures.\n- B. Incorrect. Incorrectly assigns $sp^3$ to N in $h$-BN and $sp^2$ to N in $c$-BN.\n- C. Incorrect. Uses incorrect hybridization types.\n- D. Correct. Matches our analysis: $h$-BN features $sp^2$ hybridization for both B and N, and $c$-BN features $sp^3$ hybridization for both B and N.\n- E.

This leads to $sp^2$ hybridization with a trigonal planar geometry. Each such carbon retains one unhybridized $p$ orbital that participates in the delocalized $\\pi$ system, consistent with benzene-like bonding.\n\nIn the linear two-carbon linkers with structure $-C \\equiv C-$, each carbon is bonded via one triple bond to the other carbon and one single bond to the ring (or to the network).
