The magnitude of the Burgers vector for each of the two identical partial dislocations is denoted by $b_p$. The two partial dislocations repel each other.

Here, $G$ is the shear modulus of the alloy.\n\nThe stacking fault separating the partials has a characteristic stacking fault energy, $\\gamma_{sf}$, which is the energy per unit area of the faulted plane. This stored energy creates an effective attractive force per unit length on the partial dislocations, which tends to pull them back together.
