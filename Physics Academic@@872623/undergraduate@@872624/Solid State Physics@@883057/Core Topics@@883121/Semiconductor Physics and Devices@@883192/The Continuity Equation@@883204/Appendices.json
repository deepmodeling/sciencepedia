Under steady-state conditions, an electron current is established within the bar. The electron current density, denoted as $J_n(x)$, is found to vary linearly along the length of the bar according to the relationship $J_n(x) = J_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{L}\\right)$, where $J_0$ is a positive constant representing the current density at $x=0$. To maintain this specific current profile, there must be a net rate of electron generation or recombination within the material. Let this net generation rate be denoted by $U_n(x) = G_n(x) - R_n(x)$, where $G_n(x)$ is the generation rate of electrons and $R_n(x)$ is the recombination rate of electrons, both per unit volume per unit time.
