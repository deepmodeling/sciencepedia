The operation of this device is governed by the applied voltages: the gate-to-source voltage, $V_{GS}$, and the drain-to-source voltage, $V_{DS}$. For the transistor to turn on and form a conductive channel (an inversion layer), the gate-to-source voltage must exceed a certain threshold voltage, $V_T$.\n\nWhen the transistor is on ($V_{GS} > V_T$), it initially operates in the linear (or triode) region. As $V_{DS}$ increases, the current rises. However, beyond a specific voltage known as the saturation drain voltage, $V_{D,sat}$, the drain current becomes nearly independent of $V_{DS}$, and the device is said to be in the saturation region.\n\nThe physical reason for this transition is \"channel pinch-off\" at the drain end of the transistor. This phenomenon occurs precisely when the voltage difference between the gate terminal and the drain terminal, $V_{GD}$, becomes equal to the threshold voltage, $V_T$.\n\nBased on this physical principle of channel pinch-off, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the saturation drain voltage, $V_{D,sat}$, in terms of the gate-to-source voltage, $V_{GS}$, and the threshold voltage, $V_T$.", "solution": "We consider an n-type enhancement-mode long-channel MOSFET with source as the reference for terminal voltages.
