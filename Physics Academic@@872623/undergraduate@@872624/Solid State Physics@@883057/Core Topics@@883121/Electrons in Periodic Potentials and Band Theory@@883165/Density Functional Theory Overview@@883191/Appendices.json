A cornerstone of DFT is the first Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, which establishes a fundamental relationship between the ground-state electron density of a many-electron system and the external potential acting on it.\n\nImagine two different hypothetical crystalline materials, Material Alpha and Material Beta. Material Alpha is composed of atoms of element X, and Material Beta is composed of atoms of element Y. They exhibit different crystallographic structures. Through advanced experimental techniques, researchers determine the ground-state electron density for both materials, denoted as $n_{\\text{Alpha}}(\\mathbf{r})$ and $n_{\\text{Beta}}(\\mathbf{r})$, respectively.

This means that if we use this density as an input to the calculation, the output density produced by the calculation is the same as the input density. The process is iterative, starting with an initial guess and refining the density at each step until this condition is met. Let's analyze the logical dependencies between the three tasks to establish their correct order.\n\nThe iterative loop starts with a guess for the electron density, which we call the input density, $n_{\\text{in}}(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nStep 1: The first task in the cycle must be to use this input density $n_{\\text{in}}(\\mathbf{r})$ to construct the quantities needed for the next step. The Kohn-Sham formalism states that the effective potential, $v_{\\text{eff}}(\\mathbf{r})$, is a functional of the electron density. Specifically, $v_{\\text{eff}}[n](\\mathbf{r}) = v_{\\text{ext}}(\\mathbf{r}) + v_{\\text{H}}[n](\\mathbf{r}) + v_{\\text{xc}}[n](\\mathbf{r})$, where the Hartree potential $v_{\\text{H}}$ and the exchange-correlation potential $v_{\\text{xc}}$ both depend on the density $n(\\mathbf{r})$. Therefore, the first logical step is to use $n_{\\text{in}}(\\mathbf{r})$ to calculate $v_{\\text{eff}}(\\mathbf{r})$. This corresponds to task (B).\n\nStep 2: Once the effective potential $v_{\\text{eff}}(\\mathbf{r})$ is known, it can be used to define the single-particle Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_{\\text{KS}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 + v_{\\text{eff}}(\\mathbf{r})$. The next step is to solve the eigenvalue problem for this Hamiltonian, which is the set of Kohn-Sham equations: $\\hat{H}_{\\text{KS}} \\psi_j(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon_j \\psi_j(\\mathbf{r})$. Solving these equations yields the set of single-particle orbitals, $\\{\\psi_j(\\mathbf{r})\\}$, and their corresponding energies, $\\{\\epsilon_j\\}$. This corresponds to task (C). Task (C) must follow task (B) because it requires the potential calculated in (B).\n\nStep 3: After solving the Kohn-Sham equations, we have the orbitals $\\{\\psi_j(\\mathbf{r})\\}$. The fundamental principle of DFT is that the electron density can be constructed from these orbitals. For a system with $N$ electrons, the density is calculated by summing the probability densities of the $N$ lowest-energy (occupied) orbitals. This gives the output electron density, $n_{\\text{out}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} |\\psi_j(\\mathbf{r})|^2$. This corresponds to task (A). Task (A) must follow task (C) because it requires the orbitals calculated in (C).\n\nTo summarize the flow within one iteration:\n1.  Start with $n_{\\text{in}}(\\mathbf{r})$.\n2.  Perform task (B): Use $n_{\\text{in}}(\\mathbf{r})$ to construct $v_{\\text{eff}}(\\mathbf{r})$.\n3.  Perform task (C): Use $v_{\\text{eff}}(\\mathbf{r})$ to solve for the orbitals $\\{\\psi_j(\\mathbf{r})\\}$.\n4.

Correspondingly, the pseudo-wavefunctions are smooth and nodeless near the nuclei yet match the true valence wavefunctions outside the core region.\n\nThis smoothing has direct computational consequences. Plane-wave expansions require a kinetic-energy cutoff that grows with the largest Fourier components of the wavefunctions.
