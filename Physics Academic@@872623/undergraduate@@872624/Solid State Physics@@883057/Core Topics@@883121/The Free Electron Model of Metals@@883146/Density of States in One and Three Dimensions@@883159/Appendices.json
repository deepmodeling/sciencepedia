It is a mathematical tool that bridges the gap between the discrete, quantized energy levels of a finite quantum system and the seemingly continuous energy bands of a macroscopic solid. This exercise challenges you to think critically about the fundamental nature of the DOS by comparing an idealized, infinitely long wire with a more realistic, finite-length one, clarifying how a continuous distribution of states emerges from discrete quantum levels [@problem_id:1769365].", "problem": "In solid-state physics, the concept of Density of States (DOS) is crucial for understanding the electronic and thermal properties of materials. The DOS, denoted by $g(E)$, represents the number of available electronic states per unit energy interval at a given energy $E$.\n\nFor a one-dimensional free electron gas modeling an idealized, infinitely long quantum wire, the DOS is found to be a continuous function of energy, given by $g_{\\infty}(E) = C E^{-1/2}$ for $E>0$, where $C$ is a constant that depends on the electron mass and fundamental constants.\n\nNow, consider a more realistic model of a quantum wire with a finite length $L$. The electrons are treated as free particles, but they are strictly confined within the one-dimensional box of length $L$ (i.e., the potential is zero inside the wire and infinite at its ends). Which of the following statements most accurately describes the DOS, $g_L(E)$, for this finite-length system?\n\nA. The DOS is identical to the infinite case, $g_L(E) = g_{\\infty}(E)$, because the length $L$ only affects the total number of states, not their distribution in energy.\n\nB. The DOS is a smooth, continuous function that is zero for energies below a certain minimum value and then rises, eventually approaching the behavior of the infinite wire.\n\nC. The DOS consists of a series of discrete spikes (mathematically, Dirac delta functions) located at specific, quantized energy values, and is zero everywhere else.\n\nD. The DOS is a staircase or step function, where each step corresponds to the inclusion of a new, discrete energy level.\n\nE.
