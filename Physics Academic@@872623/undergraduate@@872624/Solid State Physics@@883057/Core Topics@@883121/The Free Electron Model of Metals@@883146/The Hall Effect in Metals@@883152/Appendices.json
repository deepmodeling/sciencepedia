A steady electrical current is passed along the length of the strip. The strip has a width $w = 1.25$ cm and is placed in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B = 0.880$ T, with the field vector oriented perpendicular to the flat surface of the strip. Due to the interaction of the charge carriers with the magnetic field, a steady potential difference is established across the width of the strip. This transverse voltage is measured to be $V_T = 5.14$ µV.\n\nAssuming the charge carriers move at a uniform average drift velocity along the length of the strip, calculate the magnitude of this drift velocity. Express your answer in millimeters per second (mm/s), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the average drift velocity, $v_d$, of the charge carriers in a metallic strip. The charge carriers, each with charge $q$, move along the length of the strip. The external magnetic field, $B$, is perpendicular to their velocity.\n\nThe magnetic field exerts a Lorentz force on each charge carrier. The magnitude of this force is given by $F_B = |q| v_d B$, since the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field. This force is directed across the width of the strip.\n\nThis magnetic force causes the charge carriers to be deflected to one side of the strip, leading to an accumulation of charge on that side and a deficiency of charge (or an accumulation of opposite charge) on the other. This separation of charge creates a transverse electric field, $E_T$, across the width of the strip.\n\nThe transverse electric field, in turn, exerts an electric force on the charge carriers, with a magnitude of $F_E = |q| E_T$. This electric force is directed opposite to the magnetic force.\n\nA steady state is reached when the transverse flow of charge ceases. This occurs when the electric force perfectly balances the aagnetic force. The equilibrium condition is therefore:\n$$F_E = F_B$$\n$$|q| E_T = |q| v_d B$$\n\nThe charge $|q|$ cancels out, leaving a relationship between the electric field, drift velocity, and magnetic field:\n$$E_T = v_d B$$\n\nThe transverse electric field $E_T$ is related to the measured transverse voltage $V_T$ across the strip of width $w$. Assuming the electric field is uniform across the width, this relationship is:\n$$V_T = E_T w$$\n\nWe can express the electric field as $E_T = \\frac{V_T}{w}$.
