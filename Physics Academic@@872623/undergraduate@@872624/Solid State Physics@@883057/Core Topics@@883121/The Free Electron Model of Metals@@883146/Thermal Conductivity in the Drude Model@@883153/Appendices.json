The efficiency of the device depends on the electronic thermal conductivity, $\\kappa_e$, of the material used.

The problem also specifies that at low temperatures, the mean free time $\\tau$ is dominated by scattering from static imperfections.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the Pure Metals (A and B) with the Alloy (C)**\nMaterial C, Brass, is an alloy of Copper and Zinc. In an alloy, the atoms of the minority element (e.g., Zn atoms in a Cu-majority lattice) act as a high concentration of scattering centers for the conduction electrons. This is a form of impurity scattering.\n\nMaterials A (Copper) and B (Zinc) are described as \"high-purity.\" This implies they have a very well-ordered crystal lattice with a very low concentration of impurities or defects compared to the deliberate mixture in the alloy.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, a higher density of scattering centers leads to a shorter mean free time, $\\tau$. Since Brass has a much higher density of scattering centers than the pure metals, its mean free time will be significantly shorter.\n$$ \\tau_C \\ll \\tau_A \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tau_C \\ll \\tau_B $$\nThis drastic reduction in $\\tau_C$ for the alloy is the dominant factor affecting its conductivity. Even if the electron density $n$ for brass were slightly different from its constituents, the very small value of $\\tau_C$ ensures that its thermal conductivity, $\\kappa_C$, will be the lowest of the three.\n\nSo, we can establish the first part of our ranking: $(\\kappa_A, \\kappa_B) > \\kappa_C$.\n\n**Step 3: Compare Pure Copper (A) and Pure Zinc (B)**\nNow we need to compare Material A and Material B.

Material B (Zinc) is divalent, contributing two free electrons per atom. The number of atoms per unit volume is of a similar order of magnitude for both metals. Therefore, the free electron density in Zinc is roughly twice that in Copper: $n_B \\approx 2n_A$. Based solely on electron density, Zinc would be expected to have a higher conductivity.\n\n-   **Mean Free Time ($\\tau$)**: The problem explicitly provides a crucial piece of information: \"the mean free time for conduction electrons in high-purity copper is significantly longer than in high-purity zinc ($\\tau_{Cu} > \\tau_{Zn}$).\" This means $\\tau_A > \\tau_B$.\n\nWe have a trade-off: Zinc has a higher $n$, but Copper has a longer $\\tau$. To resolve this, we must recognize that the term \"significantly longer\" implies that the difference in $\\tau$ is the dominant factor. The superior conductivity of copper compared to most other metals is a well-known experimental fact, which is primarily attributed to the long mean free path (and thus long mean free time) of its conduction electrons. The advantage conferred by the longer $\\tau_A$ outweighs the advantage of the higher $n_B$.\n\nTherefore, the product $n_A \\tau_A$ is greater for Copper than for Zinc.\n$$ n_A \\tau_A > n_B \\tau_B $$\nThis implies that the electronic thermal conductivity of Copper is higher than that of Zinc.\n$$ \\kappa_A > \\kappa_B $$\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Results for the Final Ranking**\nFrom Step 2, we found that Material C (Brass) has the lowest thermal conductivity.\nFrom Step 3, we found that Material A (Copper) has a higher thermal conductivity than Material B (Zinc).\n\nCombining these results, we get the final ranking from highest to lowest:\n$$ \\kappa_A > \\kappa_B > \\kappa_C $$\nThis corresponds to the order: High-purity Copper > High-purity Zinc > Brass.\n\n**Step 5: Match with the Given Options**\nThe ranking A > B > C corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1823351"}]}
