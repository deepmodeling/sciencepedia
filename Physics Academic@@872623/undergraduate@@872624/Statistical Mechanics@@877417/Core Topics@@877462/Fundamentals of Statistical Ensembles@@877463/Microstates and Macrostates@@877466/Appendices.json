The system consists of two subsystems: two spin-1 particles and four spin-1/2 particles.\n\nLet the two spin-1 particles be Subsystem 1 and the four spin-1/2 particles be Subsystem 2. The particles are non-interacting, so the total number of microstates is the product of the number of microstates for each independent way the subsystems can be configured to satisfy the overall macrostate condition.\n\nThe macrostate condition is that the total magnetic quantum number, $M_{total}$, is +1.\n$$M_{total} = M_1 + M_2 = 1$$\nwhere $M_1$ is the sum of the spin projection quantum numbers for the two spin-1 particles, and $M_2$ is the sum for the four spin-1/2 particles. We need to find all possible pairs of $(M_1, M_2)$ that satisfy this condition and then count the number of ways to realize each pair.\n\nFirst, let's analyze Subsystem 1 (two spin-1 particles). Each spin-1 particle can have a spin projection quantum number $m_s \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Since the two particles are distinguishable, we can list the possible pairs of their quantum numbers $(m_{s1}, m_{s2})$ and the corresponding sum $M_1 = m_{s1} + m_{s2}$.\nThe number of microstates for Subsystem 1 for a given total magnetic quantum number $M_1$ is denoted by $\\Omega_1(M_1)$.\n- For $M_1 = 2$: The only combination is $(1, 1)$.
