This first exercise provides foundational practice in counting the specific arrangements (microstates) for distinguishable particles.

The polymer has exactly two identical, non-interacting binding sites. Any number of ligands, from zero to four, can occupy a given site. The specific arrangement of the four ligands across the two sites defines a microstate of the system. A macrostate is defined only by the number of ligands on each site, not their identities.\n\nBased on the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics, the principle of equal a priori probabilities, every possible microstate of this isolated system is equally likely to be observed. Calculate the probability of finding the system in the macrostate where two ligands are on one site and the other two are on the second site. Express your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "By the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics (principle of equal a priori probabilities), each microstate of the isolated system is equally likely. A microstate is specified by assigning each distinguishable ligand to one of the two binding sites. Since the sites are energetically identical but physically distinct locations, the assignment of each ligand is an independent binary choice.\n\nThe total number of microstates is therefore given by the multiplication rule:\n$$\nN_{\\text{tot}}=2^{4} = 16.\n$$\n\nThe macrostate of interest has two ligands on one site and two on the other. The number of microstates realizing this macrostate is the number of ways to choose which two of the four ligands occupy, say, site 1, with the remaining two necessarily on site 2. This is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\nN_{\\text{fav}}=\\binom{4}{2}=\\frac{4!}{2!\\,2!}=6.\n$$\n\nBy the fundamental postulate, the probability of the macrostate is the ratio of favorable to total microstates:\n$$\nP=\\frac{N_{\\text{fav}}}{N_{\\text{tot}}}=\\frac{\\binom{4}{2}}{2^{4}}=\\frac{6}{16}=\\frac{3}{8}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$$", "id": "1986878"}, {"introduction": "Many systems, especially at the quantum level, involve particles that are fundamentally indistinguishable, such as photons or excitons. This scenario requires a different counting methodology than that used for distinguishable particles.

The excitons are fundamentally indistinguishable from one another. In statistical mechanics, each unique physical configuration of the excitons among the quantum dots is called a microstate.
