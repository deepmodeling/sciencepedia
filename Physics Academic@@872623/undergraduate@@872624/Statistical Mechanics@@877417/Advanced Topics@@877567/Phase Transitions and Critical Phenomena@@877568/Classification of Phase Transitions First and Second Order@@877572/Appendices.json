The molar latent heat is defined as $L = T_c \\Delta s$, where $\\Delta s$ is the change in molar entropy during the transition at the temperature $T_c$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the sign and magnitude of the entropy change, $\\Delta s = s_B(T_c) - s_A(T_c)$. This is governed by the principles of thermodynamic stability. The stable phase at any given temperature and pressure is the one with the minimum molar Gibbs free energy, $g$.\n\nThe transition from Phase A to Phase B occurs upon heating. This means that for temperatures below the transition temperature $T_c$, Phase A is stable, and for temperatures above $T_c$, Phase B is stable. The Gibbs free energies must satisfy the following conditions:\n- For $T  T_c$: $g_A(T)  g_B(T)$\n- At $T = T_c$: $g_A(T_c) = g_B(T_c)$\n- For $T  T_c$: $g_B(T)  g_A(T)$\n\nLet's consider the difference in molar Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta g(T) = g_B(T) - g_A(T)$. From the conditions above, $\\Delta g(T)$ must be positive for $TT_c$, zero at $T=T_c$, and negative for $TT_c$.

A non-zero entropy difference, $\\Delta s(T_c) = s_B(T_c) - s_A(T_c) \\neq 0$, also signifies that this is a first-order phase transition.\n\nNow we can calculate the molar latent heat, $L$.
