The lattice consists of sites arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns. The sites are connected by bonds to their nearest neighbors, forming a grid.\n\nThe dual of this lattice is constructed according to the following rules:\n1.  A dual site is placed in the center of each elementary plaquette of the original lattice. An elementary plaquette is the smallest square formed by four neighboring sites and the four bonds connecting them.\n2.  An additional, special dual site is placed in the unbounded exterior region that surrounds the finite lattice.\n3.  A dual bond is drawn to connect any two dual sites whose corresponding regions (plaquettes or the exterior region) are separated by a single bond in the original lattice.\n\nThe coordination number of a site is defined as the number of bonds connected to it.

The dual graph is constructed by placing a dual site in each face (each elementary plaquette and the exterior unbounded region) and, for every original bond separating two faces, adding one dual bond between the corresponding dual sites.\n\nBy construction of the planar dual, the coordination number (degree) of a dual site equals the number of original bonds along the boundary of its corresponding face.
