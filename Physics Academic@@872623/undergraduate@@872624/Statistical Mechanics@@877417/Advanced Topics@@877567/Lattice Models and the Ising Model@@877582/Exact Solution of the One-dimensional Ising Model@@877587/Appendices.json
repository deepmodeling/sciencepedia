The magnetic orientation of each ion can be modeled as a classical spin, $s_i$, which can point either \"up\" ($s_i = +1$) or \"down\" ($s_i = -1$). The ions are indexed $i=1, 2, 3$ as one moves around the triangle.\n\nThe total energy of the system is governed by the nearest-neighbor interactions described by the Ising model Hamiltonian. In the absence of an external magnetic field, this energy is given by:\n$$E = -J \\sum_{i=1}^{3} s_i s_{i+1}$$\nIn this expression, $J$ is the exchange coupling constant. The sum represents the interaction between each spin and its next neighbor in the ring, thus imposing periodic boundary conditions where the third spin interacts with the first, formally written as $s_{4} \\equiv s_{1}$.\n\nThe system is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at an absolute temperature $T$.
