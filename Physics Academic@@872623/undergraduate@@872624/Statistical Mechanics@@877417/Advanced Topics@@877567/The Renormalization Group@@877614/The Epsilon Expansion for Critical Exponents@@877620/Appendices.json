The interaction is characterized by a coupling constant $u$. In the renormalization group analysis of this theory, one computes corrections to the coupling $u$ due to fluctuations at different length scales. The leading one-loop correction to the four-point vertex, in the simplified case of zero external momenta and zero mass, involves evaluating an integral over the loop momentum. One of the three diagrams contributing to this correction gives rise to the integral:\n$$I = \\frac{u^2}{2} \\int \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{1}{(q^2)^2}$$\nwhere $q=|\\mathbf{q}|$ is the magnitude of the momentum vector $\\mathbf{q}$ in $d$ spatial dimensions.\n\nThis integral is divergent for dimensions $d \\le 4$. To analyze this divergence, we regularize the integral by imposing an ultraviolet (high-momentum) cutoff $\\Lambda$, restricting the integration domain to $q \\le \\Lambda$. You may assume an implicit infrared regulator that makes the integral well-behaved at $q=0$, so you only need to consider the contribution from the upper limit of integration.
