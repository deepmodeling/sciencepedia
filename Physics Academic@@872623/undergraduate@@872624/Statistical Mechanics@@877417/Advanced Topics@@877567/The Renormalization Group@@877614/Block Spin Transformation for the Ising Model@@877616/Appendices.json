We assume periodic boundary conditions.\n\nWe perform a real-space renormalization group transformation by grouping the spins into blocks of three. The $k$-th block consists of spins $(s_{3k-2}, s_{3k-1}, s_{3k})$, and it is mapped to a single new block spin $S_k = \\pm 1$. The mapping follows a specific asymmetric rule: the new block spin $S_k$ is assigned the value $-1$ if and only if all three original spins in the block are $-1$. For all other seven configurations of the three original spins, the block spin is assigned the value $S_k = +1$.\n\nThis coarse-graining procedure effectively maps the original Hamiltonian $H$ for the spins $\\{s_i\\}$ to a new, renormalized Hamiltonian $H'$ for the block spins $\\{S_k\\}$. A fascinating consequence of the asymmetric rule is the generation of an effective magnetic field in the renormalized system, even though the original system had none. If we neglect the interactions between the new block spins, the renormalized Hamiltonian can be approximated as a sum over independent blocks, $H'_{\\text{blocks}} = \\sum_{k} (C - h'S_k)$, where $C$ is a constant that preserves the total partition function and $h'$ is the effective magnetic field induced by the transformation.\n\nTo find $h'$, you only need to consider the interactions within a single three-spin block, described by the Hamiltonian fragment $H_{\\text{block}} = -J(s_1s_2 + s_2s_3)$.
