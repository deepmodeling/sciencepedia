This is achieved through a decimation procedure where we 'integrate out' all the even-indexed spins ($s_2, s_4, s_6, \\dots$). In the low-temperature limit (where the thermal energy $k_B T$ is much smaller than the interaction energy $J$), the system will overwhelmingly occupy its lowest energy state. This means that for any given configuration of the odd-indexed spins ($s_1, s_3, s_5, \\dots$), the even-indexed spins will arrange themselves to minimize the total energy.\n\nThis process results in an effective interaction between the remaining odd-indexed spins.
