It provides the probability of finding a particle at a distance $r$ from a reference particle. A key step in computing $g(r)$ from simulation data is to construct a histogram of inter-particle distances.\n\nConsider a 2D computer simulation of $N=4$ identical point particles confined to a square box of side length $L$. The simulation employs periodic boundary conditions. This means if a particle moves out of one side of the box, it re-enters from the opposite side. Consequently, the distance between any two particles must be calculated using the minimum image convention. For any pair of particles, if the separation in a given dimension (e.g., $x$) is $\\Delta x$, the convention dictates using the shortest distance, $\\Delta x'$, which may involve \"wrapping around\" the box.
