On the Bethe lattice, the sub-tree connected to any neighbor spin $s_i$ (when viewed from $s_0$) is identical to the other sub-trees. A spin in such a sub-tree, say at site $k$, itself has $z-1$ neighbors further down the tree. The magnetization of site $k$ is related to the effective field $h_{eff}$ (which acts on it from its own $z-1$ neighbors) via the same functional form as the magnetization of the central spin $s_0$ is related to the effective fields on its neighbors.\n\nThe Curie temperature $T_c$ is the critical temperature below which the system develops a spontaneous magnetization, corresponding to the appearance of a non-trivial solution ($h_{eff} \\neq 0$) in the absence of an external field.\n\nYour task is to derive the Curie temperature $T_c$ for this model.
