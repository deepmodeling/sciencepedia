The chain is composed of $N$ rigid segments, each of length $l$. The first segment starts at the origin of an x-axis. Each subsequent segment can be oriented either in the positive direction (a \"+ step\") or the negative direction (a \"- step\") along this axis. A specific sequence of these orientations for all $N$ segments defines a unique conformation of the chain.\n\nGiven that $N$ is a positive even integer, determine the total number of distinct conformations for which the end of the final segment is located precisely at the origin.
