For each degree of freedom, corresponding to a generalized coordinate $q_i$, there is a conjugate momentum $p_i$. Therefore, the total dimensionality of the phase space is twice the total number of degrees of freedom of the system. We will calculate the contribution from each component of the gas mixture separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's consider the $N_A$ noble gas atoms.\nEach noble gas atom is modeled as a point-like particle. The motion of a point particle in three-dimensional space is purely translational. To specify its position, we need three spatial coordinates, for example, $(x, y, z)$. These represent 3 degrees of freedom.\nFor each of these position coordinates, there is a corresponding linear momentum component: $(p_x, p_y, p_z)$.\nThus, for a single noble gas atom, the number of phase space coordinates is $3 (\\text{position}) + 3 (\\text{momentum}) = 6$.\nFor a system of $N_A$ such non-interacting atoms, the total number of phase space coordinates is $6 \\times N_A = 6 N_A$.\n\nNext, let's consider the $N_D$ diatomic molecules.\nEach diatomic molecule is modeled as a rigid dumbbell. This is an extended object, so we must consider both its translational and rotational motion.\nThe translational motion of the molecule's center of mass is identical to that of a point particle. This requires 3 position coordinates and 3 corresponding linear momentum coordinates. This contributes $3 + 3 = 6$ dimensions to the phase space for each molecule.\nThe rotational motion describes the orientation of the molecule in space. A general rigid body has 3 rotational degrees of freedom. However, a diatomic molecule is linear (a dumbbell). Rotation about the axis connecting the two atoms has a negligible moment of inertia and is typically not considered a degree of freedom in classical mechanics. Therefore, a linear rigid rotor has only 2 rotational degrees of freedom. These can be described by two angles, for example, the polar angle $\\theta$ and the azimuthal angle $\\phi$.\nFor each of these two rotational coordinates, there is a corresponding conjugate angular momentum, $p_\\theta$ and $p_\\phi$.\nThus, the rotational motion contributes $2 (\\text{angular position}) + 2 (\\text{angular momentum}) = 4$ dimensions to the phase space for each molecule.\nThe problem specifies that the molecule is a *rigid* dumbbell, so we explicitly do not consider any vibrational motion.\nTherefore, for a single rigid diatomic molecule, the total number of phase space coordinates is $6 (\\text{translational}) + 4 (\\text{rotational}) = 10$.\nFor a system of $N_D$ such molecules, the total number of phase space coordinates is $10 \\times N_D = 10 N_D$.\n\nFinally, the total dimensionality of the phase space for the entire system is the sum of the dimensionalities for the two components, as they are part of the same system.\n$$\n\\mathcal{D} = (\\text{Contribution from noble gas atoms}) + (\\text{Contribution from diatomic molecules})\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{D} = 6 N_A + 10 N_D\n$$\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1954202"}, {"introduction": "Beyond just its dimensions, the true power of phase space lies in its coordinates, especially the canonical momentum.
