We are interested in comparing the number of possible system configurations (microstates) for two different types of particles.\n\nFirst, consider a system of $k=3$ identical particles of Type A. These particles are governed by an exclusion rule, which states that no two particles can occupy the same energy level simultaneously. Let the total number of unique arrangements for this system be $W_A$.\n\nSecond, consider a different system of $k=3$ identical particles of Type B. These particles are not subject to any exclusion rule; any number of them can occupy a single energy level.
