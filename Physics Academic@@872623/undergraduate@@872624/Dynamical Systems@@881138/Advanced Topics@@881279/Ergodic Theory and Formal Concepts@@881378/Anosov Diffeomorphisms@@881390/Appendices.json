The 2-torus, denoted $\\mathbb{T}^2$, can be visualized as a square with opposite sides identified, or more formally as the quotient space $\\mathbb{R}^2 / \\mathbb{Z}^2$. A matrix $A$ with integer entries and determinant 1, i.e., $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, induces a diffeomorphism $F_A: \\mathbb{T}^2 \\to \\mathbb{T}^2$ defined by $F_A(\\mathbf{x}) = A\\mathbf{x} \\pmod 1$, where the modulus is taken component-wise.\n\nA key concept in this context is that of an Anosov diffeomorphism. A diffeomorphism $F: \\mathbb{T}^2 \\to \\mathbb{T}^2$ is called an Anosov diffeomorphism if its derivative map, $DF$, has a hyperbolic structure on the tangent space at every point. For a linear map $F_A$, this condition simplifies significantly: the map $F_A$ is an Anosov diffeomorphism if and only if the matrix $A$ has no eigenvalues with magnitude equal to 1. This property ensures that the tangent space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ splits into a stable (contracting) direction and an unstable (expanding) direction.\n\nConsider the specific linear map on the torus induced by the matrix for a horizontal shear transformation:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nBased on the definition provided, determine whether the map $F_A$ is an Anosov diffeomorphism and select the correct reason.\n\nA.

Therefore, $F_{A}$ is a diffeomorphism.\n\nAnosov for a linear toral automorphism requires that no eigenvalue of $A$ has magnitude equal to $1$. To test this, compute the characteristic polynomial of $A$:\n$$\np(\\lambda)=\\det(A-\\lambda I)=\\det\\begin{pmatrix}1-\\lambda  1 \\\\ 0  1-\\lambda\\end{pmatrix}=(1-\\lambda)^{2}.\n$$\nHence the only eigenvalue is $\\lambda=1$ with algebraic multiplicity $2$.
