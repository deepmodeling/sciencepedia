Let $C$ be a simple closed curve that forms the boundary of a square in the $xy$-plane. The vertices of this square are located at $(1, 1)$, $(-1, 1)$, $(-1, -1)$, and $(1, -1)$. The curve $C$ is traversed once in the counter-clockwise direction, starting from the vertex $(1, -1)$.\n\nThe Poincaré index of the vector field $F$ with respect to the curve $C$ measures the net number of times the vector $F(x,y)$ rotates counter-clockwise as the point $(x,y)$ traverses the curve $C$.\n\nDetermine the value of the Poincaré index for the given vector field and path.", "solution": "The Poincaré index $I$ of a vector field $F(x,y) = (P(x,y), Q(x,y))$ along a closed curve $C$ is given by the total change in the angle of the vector, $\\Delta\\theta_{total}$, divided by $2\\pi$. The angle $\\theta$ is defined by $\\tan(\\theta) = Q/P$. So, $I = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_{total}}{2\\pi}$.\n\nWe need to calculate the total change in the angle of the vector field $F(x, y) = (x^2 - y^2, 2xy)$ as we traverse the square $C$ counter-clockwise. The square is defined by its vertices $V_1=(1,-1)$, $V_2=(1,1)$, $V_3=(-1,1)$, and $V_4=(-1,-1)$. The path starts at $V_1$ and proceeds through $V_2, V_3, V_4$ and back to $V_1$. We can calculate the change in angle along each of the four segments of the square.\n\nLet $\\theta(x,y)$ be the angle of the vector $F(x,y)$. We must track this angle continuously along the path.\n\n**Segment 1: from $(1, -1)$ to $(1, 1)$**\nThis segment, $C_1$, can be parameterized by $x=1$ and $y$ varying from $-1$ to $1$.\nThe vector field along this path is $F(1, y) = (1 - y^2, 2y)$.\nLet's evaluate the angle at the start and end points of this segment.\nAt the starting point $(1, -1)$, the vector is $F(1, -1) = (1 - (-1)^2, 2(-1)) = (0, -2)$.
