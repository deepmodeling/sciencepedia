This thought experiment moves from a simple plane to the surface of a sphere, where topology plays a crucial role. You will investigate how a degenerate feature—a continuous circle of fixed points—resolves under a generic perturbation, revealing a deep connection between the local properties of fixed points and the global geometry of the space they inhabit [@problem_id:1711209].", "problem": "Consider a smooth vector field defined on the surface of a perfect sphere. This vector field has the specific property that it is identically zero at every point along the sphere's equator, forming a continuous circle of fixed points. Suppose this system is subjected to a small, generic perturbation. A \"generic\" perturbation can be thought of as a random, small-scale modification to the vector field across the entire sphere, without introducing any special symmetries.\n\nAfter the perturbation, the original continuous circle of fixed points is altered. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate qualitative description of the new set of fixed points for the perturbed vector field?\n\nA. The equator remains a continuous circle of fixed points.\n\nB. All fixed points on the sphere are eliminated.\n\nC. A finite, odd number of isolated fixed points will remain near the original equator.\n\nD. A finite, even number of isolated fixed points will remain near the original equator.\n\nE. A countably infinite number of isolated fixed points will appear near the original equator.", "solution": "The problem describes a dynamical system on a sphere and asks how its set of fixed points changes under a small, generic perturbation.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the initial system. The vector field is zero along the entire equator. A continuous line or curve of fixed points is a \"degenerate\" or \"non-hyperbolic\" feature. At any point on this line, the Jacobian matrix of the vector field has at least one zero eigenvalue, corresponding to the direction along the line of fixed points. Systems with non-hyperbolic fixed points are known to be structurally unstable. This means that an arbitrarily small, generic perturbation can lead to a qualitative change in the phase portrait, including the number and nature of the fixed points. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that the equator would remain a line of fixed points. This rules out option A.\n\nA \"generic\" perturbation resolves such degenerate features into \"generic\" ones. For a vector field on a 2D surface like a sphere, a generic set of fixed points consists of a finite number of isolated, hyperbolic fixed points. Hyperbolic fixed points are those where the Jacobian matrix has no eigenvalues with a zero real part. This means we expect the continuous circle of fixed points to break apart and be replaced by a finite number of isolated points. This rules out option E, which suggests an infinite number of points.\n\nNow we must determine the properties of this finite set of new fixed points. This is governed by a powerful result in topology called the Poincaré-Hopf Theorem. The theorem states that for any smooth vector field on a compact, oriented manifold (like our sphere) with only a finite number of isolated fixed points, the sum of the indices of these fixed points is equal to the Euler characteristic of the manifold.\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a sphere, denoted $\\chi(S^2)$, is 2.\nSo, if the perturbed field has isolated fixed points $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_N$, the theorem states:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\text{ind}(p_i) = \\chi(S^2) = 2 $$\nFor a generic (hyperbolic) fixed point in a 2D vector field, the index can only be $+1$ (for sources, sinks, and centers) or $-1$ (for saddles). Generic perturbations typically do not create centers, so the indices of the resulting fixed points will be either $+1$ or $-1$.\n\nLet $N_+$ be the number of fixed points with index $+1$ (sources or sinks) and $N_-$ be the number of fixed points with index $-1$ (saddles). The total number of fixed points is $N = N_+ + N_-$.\nFrom the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, we must have:\n$$ N_+ - N_- = 2 $$\nThis equation immediately tells us that it's impossible for all fixed points to be eliminated, because if $N=0$, the sum of indices would be 0, not 2. This rules out option B.\n\nNow we can analyze the total number of fixed points, $N$. We can express $N_+$ from the theorem as $N_+ = N_- + 2$. Substituting this into the expression for the total number of points:\n$$ N = N_+ + N_- = (N_- + 2) + N_- = 2N_- + 2 $$\nThis can be rewritten as $N = 2(N_- + 1)$. Since $N_-$ must be a non-negative integer ($N_- \\ge 0$), this equation shows that the total number of fixed points, $N$, must be an even integer. The minimum possible number of fixed points is 2 (when $N_-=0$), but it could also be 4, 6, 8, etc.\n\nSince $N$ must be an even integer, this rules out option C, which suggests an odd number of fixed points.\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the continuous circle of fixed points is replaced by a finite, even number of isolated fixed points. These points will be located near the original equator where the perturbation broke the degeneracy.\n\nThis leaves option D as the only correct statement. A generic perturbation breaks the structurally unstable line of fixed points and creates a new, structurally stable configuration of a finite, even number of isolated fixed points.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1711209"}]}
