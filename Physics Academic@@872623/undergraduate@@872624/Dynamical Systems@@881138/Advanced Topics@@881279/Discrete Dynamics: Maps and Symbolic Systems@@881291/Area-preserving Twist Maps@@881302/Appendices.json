For the Type B fixed points, let this stability interval be $(c, d)$.\n\nDetermine the numerical values of the interval boundaries $a, b, c,$ and $d$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the general form of the fixed points and then analyze their linear stability by studying the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the map evaluated at these points.\n\n**Step 1: Finding the Fixed Points**\n\nA fixed point $(x^*, y^*)$ satisfies the conditions $x_{n+1} = x^*$ and $y_{n+1} = y^*$. We substitute $(x_n, y_n) = (x^*, y^*)$ into the map equations:\n$$y^* = y^* + K \\sin(x^*)$$\n$$x^* = (x^* + \\alpha y^*) \\pmod{2\\pi}$$\n\nFrom the first equation, assuming $K \\neq 0$, we must have:\n$$K \\sin(x^*) = 0 \\implies \\sin(x^*) = 0$$\nThis implies that $x^* = l\\pi$ for any integer $l$. This confirms the existence of the two families of fixed points in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$: one at $x^*=0$ (for $l=0, 2, 4, \\dots$) and another at $x^*=\\pi$ (for $l=1, 3, 5, \\dots$).\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n$$\\alpha y^* = 2m\\pi$$\nfor some integer $m$. This is because the position $x$ is an angle and only changes if a multiple of $2\\pi$ is added. Substituting $\\alpha = 1/3$:\n$$\\frac{1}{3} y^* = 2m\\pi \\implies y^* = 6m\\pi$$\nThus, the fixed points of the map are located at $(l\\pi, 6m\\pi)$ for any integers $l$ and $m$.\n\n**Step 2: Linear Stability Analysis**\n\nTo analyze the stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the map. First, let's write the map as a single transformation $T(x_n, y_n) = (x_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$. To compute the partial derivatives, it's easier to substitute the expression for $y_{n+1}$ into the one for $x_{n+1}$:\n$$x_{n+1} = x_n + \\alpha(y_n + K \\sin(x_n)) = x_n + \\frac{1}{3}y_n + \\frac{K}{3}\\sin(x_n)$$\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + K \\sin(x_n)$$\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $J$ is given by:\n$$J(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x_{n+1}}{\\partial x_n} & \\frac{\\partial x_{n+1}}{\\partial y_n} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y_{n+1}}{\\partial x_n} & \\frac{\\partial y_{n+1}}{\\partial y_n} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(x) & \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ K\\cos(x) & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe evaluate this matrix at the fixed points $(l\\pi, 6m\\pi)$. The Jacobian only depends on the $x$-coordinate:\n$$J(l\\pi) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi) & \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ K\\cos(l\\pi) & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n**Step 3: Stability Condition**\n\nThe stability of a fixed point of a two-dimensional map is determined by the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the Jacobian matrix, which are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\lambda^2 - \\tau\\lambda + \\Delta = 0$, where $\\tau = \\text{Tr}(J)$ and $\\Delta = \\det(J)$.\n\nLet's compute the determinant and trace of $J(l\\pi)$:\n$$\\Delta = \\det(J(l\\pi)) = \\left(1 + \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi)\\right)(1) - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)(K\\cos(l\\pi)) = 1 + \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi) - \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi) = 1$$\nSince the determinant is 1, the map is area-preserving. For an area-preserving map, a fixed point is linearly stable (elliptic) if its eigenvalues are complex conjugates on the unit circle. This occurs when the trace $\\tau$ satisfies the condition $|\\tau| < 2$.\n\nThe trace is:\n$$\\tau = \\text{Tr}(J(l\\pi)) = 1 + \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi) + 1 = 2 + \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi)$$\nThe stability condition is therefore:\n$$|2 + \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi)| < 2$$\nThis inequality is equivalent to:\n$$-2 < 2 + \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi) < 2$$\n$$-4 < \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi) < 0$$\n\n**Step 4: Determine Stability Intervals for Each Family**\n\nWe now apply this condition to the two families of fixed points.\n\n**Type A (x* = 0):**\nThis corresponds to an even integer value for $l$ (e.g., $l=0$). For even $l$, $\\cos(l\\pi) = 1$. The stability condition becomes:\n$$-4 < \\frac{K}{3}(1) < 0 \\implies -4 < \\frac{K}{3} < 0$$\nMultiplying all parts of the inequality by 3, we get:\n$$-12 < K < 0$$\nSo, the stability interval for Type A fixed points is $(-12, 0)$. This gives us $a = -12$ and $b = 0$.\n\n**Type B (x* = $\\pi$):**\nThis corresponds to an odd integer value for $l$ (e.g., $l=1$). For odd $l$, $\\cos(l\\pi) = -1$. The stability condition becomes:\n$$-4 < \\frac{K}{3}(-1) < 0 \\implies -4 < -\\frac{K}{3} < 0$$\nMultiplying all parts of the inequality by $-3$ reverses the inequality signs:\n$$12 > K > 0$$\nSo, the stability interval for Type B fixed points is $(0, 12)$. This gives us $c = 0$ and $d = 12$.\n\nIn summary, we have found $a=-12$, $b=0$, $c=0$, and $d=12$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -12 & 0 & 0 & 12 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1661864"}, {"introduction": "One of the most profound features of area-preserving twist maps is the transition from orderly, predictable motion to widespread chaos as a parameter is increased.
