Each symbol $S_n$ in the sequence describes the position of the corresponding iterate $x_{n+1} = f_c^{n+1}(0)$ relative to the critical point $x_c=0$.

The given sequence is $LR\\overline{R}$.\n\nLet's translate the symbolic sequence into algebraic conditions:\n1.  **$S_0=L$**: This means the first iterate $x_1 = f_c(0) = c$ must be less than the critical point 0. Thus, we have the condition $c  0$.\n2.  **$S_1=R$**: This means the second iterate $x_2 = f_c(x_1) = f_c(c) = c^2+c$ must be greater than 0. The inequality $c^2+c > 0$, or $c(c+1) > 0$, combined with the condition $c0$, implies that we must have $c+1  0$, so $c  -1$.\n3.  **$S_n=R$ for all $n \\geq 2$**: This means that all subsequent iterates $x_3, x_4, \\dots$ must be greater than or equal to 0. The sequence of symbols becomes permanently 'R'. The simplest way for this to occur is if the orbit becomes fixed at a positive value. This happens if an iterate lands on a positive fixed point of the map.\n\nLet's test the condition that the iterate $x_2$ is itself the positive fixed point of the map. A fixed point $u$ must satisfy $u = f_c(u) = u^2+c$. For $u$ to be a positive fixed point, we must have $u>0$.\n\nWe set the second iterate equal to this fixed point: $x_2 = u$. This gives us a system of two equations:\n$$\n\\text{(1)} \\quad x_2 = c^2+c\n$$\n$$\n\\text{(2)} \\quad u = u^2+c\n$$\nwith the condition $x_2 = u$. Substituting $u$ with $c^2+c$ in the second equation gives:\n$$\nc^2+c = (c^2+c)^2 + c\n$$\n$$\nc^2 = (c^2+c)^2\n$$\nThis equation implies $c^2+c = \\pm \\sqrt{c^2} = \\pm c$. We have two cases:\nCase A: $c^2+c = c \\implies c^2 = 0 \\implies c=0$. This contradicts our condition $c-1$.\nCase B: $c^2+c = -c \\implies c^2+2c = 0 \\implies c(c+2)=0$. The solutions are $c=0$ and $c=-2$. Again, $c=0$ is discarded.\n\nThe only valid candidate is $c=-2$. Let's verify this solution. If $c=-2$, it satisfies $c-1$. The map is $f(x) = x^2-2$.\nThe critical orbit is:\n- $x_1 = f(0) = -2$. Since $-2  0$, $S_0=L$.\n- $x_2 = f(-2) = (-2)^2 - 2 = 2$. Since $2 > 0$, $S_1=R$.\n- $x_3 = f(2) = 2^2 - 2 = 2$. Since $2 > 0$, $S_2=R$.\n\nAll subsequent iterates remain at 2, so $S_n=R$ for all $n \\ge 1$. The resulting kneading sequence is $LRRRR\\dots$, which is $LR\\overline{R}$.
