The system is known to eventually settle into a stable equilibrium state, also known as a stable fixed point. An experiment is conducted where a single observable quantity of the system, denoted by the time series $x(t)$, is measured at regular intervals. The system starts from an initial state away from equilibrium and, after a sufficiently long time, the measured value $x(t)$ approaches a constant value, let's call it $x_{fp}$.\n\nTo analyze the underlying dynamics from this single time series, the method of time-delay embedding is employed. A state of the system at time $t$ is reconstructed in a 3-dimensional space using the vector $\\mathbf{V}(t) = (x(t), x(t-\\tau), x(t-2\\tau))$, where $\\tau$ is a carefully chosen positive time delay.\n\nAfter the initial transient phase has passed and the system has been evolving for a very long time, what is the geometric form of the attractor in the 3-dimensional reconstructed space?

The problem states that the system settles into a stable equilibrium, which means the observable $x(t)$ approaches a constant value $x_{fp}$ as time $t$ goes to infinity. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = x_{fp} $$\n\nThe reconstruction of the system's state space is performed using time-delay embedding.

In the 3-dimensional reconstructed space, this represents a single, fixed point. Therefore, as time evolves, all trajectories in the reconstructed space will converge to this specific point.
