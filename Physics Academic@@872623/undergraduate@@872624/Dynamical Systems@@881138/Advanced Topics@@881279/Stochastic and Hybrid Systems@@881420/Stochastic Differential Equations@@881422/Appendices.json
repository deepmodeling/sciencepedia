This first exercise explores a fundamental question about random walks, framed within a financial context of setting 'take-profit' and 'stop-loss' boundaries. By calculating the probability of a process hitting one boundary before another, we develop an intuition for the excursions of random paths and apply the powerful martingale property of Brownian motion, a concept that underpins much of stochastic calculus [@problem_id:1710319].", "problem": "A financial analyst models the evolution of a speculative asset's price, $P(t)$, over time $t$. The model assumes that the natural logarithm of the price ratio relative to its initial price $P(0)$, defined as $X_t = \\ln(P(t)/P(0))$, follows the dynamics of a standard one-dimensional Wiener process $W_t$. The process starts from $X_0 = 0$.\n\nThe analyst implements an automated trading strategy based on two predefined thresholds. A 'take-profit' order is triggered if the process $X_t$ first reaches an upper boundary $a > 0$. A 'stop-loss' order is triggered if $X_t$ first reaches a lower boundary $-b$, where $b > 0$. We assume the process will eventually hit one of these boundaries.\n\nFind the probability that the trading position is closed due to the 'take-profit' order being triggered, rather than the 'stop-loss' order. Your answer should be a symbolic expression in terms of $a$ and $b$.", "solution": "Let $X_{t}=W_{t}$ be a standard Wiener process with $X_{0}=0$.

This problem models population growth in a fluctuating environment and reveals a surprising, counter-intuitive result about long-term survival, where random noise can lead to extinction even when the average growth rate is positive. To solve it, you will use Itô's Lemma, the cornerstone of stochastic calculus, to transform the SDE into a more manageable form and analyze its long-term behavior [@problem_id:1710345].", "problem": "A simplified model for the population size of a species, denoted by $X_t$ at time $t$, is used to study the effects of a randomly fluctuating environment. The population dynamics are governed by the following linear Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE):\n$$dX_t = a X_t dt + X_t dW_t$$\nwhere the initial population $X_0$ is positive. In this model, $a$ is a dimensionless constant that represents the population's net intrinsic growth rate, combining birth and death rates under average environmental conditions. The term $W_t$ represents a standard Wiener process, which models unpredictable, random shocks to the population due to environmental variability.\n\nThe long-term survival of the species is a key concern. The species is considered to face certain extinction if its population size converges to zero almost surely as time approaches infinity, i.e., $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} X_t = 0$ with probability one. It can be shown that there exists a critical value for the intrinsic growth rate, which we denote as $a_c$. If the species' actual growth rate $a$ is less than this critical value ($a  a_c$), the population is guaranteed to go extinct.
