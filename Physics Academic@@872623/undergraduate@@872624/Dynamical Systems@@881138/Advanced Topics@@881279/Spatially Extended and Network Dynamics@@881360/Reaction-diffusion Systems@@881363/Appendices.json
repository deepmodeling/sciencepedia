A localized group of cells at the origin, $x=0$, is engineered to continuously produce a signaling molecule, known as a morphogen. This morphogen diffuses along the channel, allowing cells to sense their position relative to the source. The concentration of this morphogen, $C(x)$, at a position $x$ is governed by two competing processes. The first is diffusion, characterized by a constant diffusion coefficient $D$. The second is active degradation of the morphogen by enzymes present throughout the medium; this is a first-order process with a rate constant $k$.\n\nAfter a sufficient amount of time, the system reaches a steady state, where the concentration profile no longer changes with time.

The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, we solve the homogeneous equation $u_h'' - u_h = 0$. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - 1 = 0$, which has roots $r = \\pm 1$.
