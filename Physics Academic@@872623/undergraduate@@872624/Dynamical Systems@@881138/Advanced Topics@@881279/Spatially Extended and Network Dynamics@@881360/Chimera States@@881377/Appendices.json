This defines an initial value problem for $N$ coupled first-order ODEs. For such a problem, one must first fully specify the vector field and the initial condition before performing any time integration, then integrate forward, remove transients to focus on the long-term behavior (attractor), and finally analyze observables that reveal the chimera signature.\n\nFirst, one must specify the fixed parameters of the model to define the right-hand side map $f:\\mathbb{T}^{N}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ of the ODE. Writing the system compactly as\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta}_{i}=f_{i}(\\theta;\\omega,K,R,\\alpha), \\quad i\\in\\{1,\\dots,N\\},\n$$\nwe see that the vector field depends on the constants $N$, $\\omega$, $K$, $R$, and $\\alpha$. Without these, the ODE is not fully defined. Therefore, step (ii) must precede all others.\n\nSecond, an initial value problem requires an initial condition. One must assign phases $\\theta_{i}(0)$ for all $i$. Since the goal is to find a chimera state, one typically chooses a specially prepared non-uniform initial condition to bias the dynamics toward coexistence of coherent and incoherent groups. Thus step (iv) naturally follows after specifying the parameters in step (ii).\n\nThird, with the vector field $f$ and initial condition $\\theta(0)$ specified, one can numerically integrate the ODE forward in time using an appropriate method (for example, a Runge-Kutta scheme), which is step (i). This produces a trajectory $t\\mapsto\\theta(t)$.\n\nFourth, to observe the long-term behavior, one discards an initial transient interval to allow the trajectory to approach its attractor. Denote a transient time $T_{\\mathrm{trans}}$ and only consider data for $t\\geq T_{\\mathrm{trans}}$. This is step (v). This practice ensures that any initial-condition-induced short-time effects do not contaminate asymptotic diagnostics.\n\nFifth, one analyzes the post-transient dynamics to detect the chimera hallmark: coexistence of a synchronized subgroup and an incoherent subgroup. A standard diagnostic is the effective frequency of each oscillator, computed as a long-time average after the transient:\n$$\n\\Omega_{i}=\\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\theta_{i}(T_{\\mathrm{trans}}+T)-\\theta_{i}(T_{\\mathrm{trans}})}{T}.\n$$\nIn a chimera, there exists a subset of indices for which $\\Omega_{i}$ take an identical value (phase-locked group) and a complementary subset where $\\Omega_{i}$ are distributed over an interval (drifting group). This analysis corresponds to step (iii) and must come after integration and transient removal.\n\nPutting the logically necessary order together yields the sequence: specify parameters (ii) → set initial condition (iv) → integrate (i) → discard transients (v) → analyze for chimera (iii).
