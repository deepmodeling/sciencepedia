The Laplacian matrix $L$ is constructed as $L = D - A$, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix and $D$ is the diagonal degree matrix. For this system, the entry $A_{ij}$ of the adjacency matrix is equal to the coupling strength $w$ if units $i$ and $j$ are connected ($i \\neq j$), and 0 otherwise. The diagonal entry $D_{ii}$ of the degree matrix is the sum of the coupling strengths of all connections attached to unit $i$.
