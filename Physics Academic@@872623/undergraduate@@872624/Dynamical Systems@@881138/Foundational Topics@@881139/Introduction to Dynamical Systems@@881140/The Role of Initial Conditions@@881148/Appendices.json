The map is given by the function $f(x) = 2x \\pmod 1$, where the operation $a \\pmod 1$ gives the fractional part of $a$. The orbit of an initial condition $x_0$ is the sequence of points $x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots$ generated by iterating the map, such that $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$ for $n \\ge 0$.\n\nAn initial condition $x_0$ is said to generate a periodic orbit of prime period $p$ if $f^p(x_0) = x_0$ and $f^k(x_0) \\neq x_0$ for all integers $k$ such that $1 \\le k  p$. Here, $f^p$ denotes the $p$-th iteration of the map $f$.\n\nFind the smallest positive initial condition $x_0$ that generates a periodic orbit of prime period 3. Express your answer as a rational number in its simplest form.", "solution": "Let the doubling map be $f(x) = 2x \\pmod 1$. We are looking for an initial condition $x_0$ that generates a periodic orbit of prime period 3. This means that $x_3 = x_0$, and that $x_1 \\neq x_0$ and $x_2 \\neq x_0$.\n\nFirst, let's express the third iterate of the map, $f^3(x_0)$, in terms of $x_0$.\nThe first iteration is:\n$x_1 = f(x_0) = 2x_0 \\pmod 1$\n\nThe second iteration is:\n$x_2 = f(x_1) = f(f(x_0)) = 2(x_1) \\pmod 1 = 2(2x_0 \\pmod 1) \\pmod 1$\nA key property of the modulo operator is that $a(b \\pmod 1) \\pmod 1 = (ab) \\pmod 1$ for an integer $a$. Therefore, we can write:\n$x_2 = 4x_0 \\pmod 1$\n\nThe third iteration is:\n$x_3 = f(x_2) = 2(x_2) \\pmod 1 = 2(4x_0 \\pmod 1) \\pmod 1 = 8x_0 \\pmod 1$\n\nThe condition for a point to be part of a period-3 orbit (or a fixed point, or a period-1 point) is $x_3 = x_0$. So we must solve the equation:\n$8x_0 \\pmod 1 = x_0$\n\nThe expression $a \\pmod 1$ is defined as $a - \\lfloor a \\rfloor$, where $\\lfloor a \\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $a$.\nSubstituting this definition into our equation:\n$8x_0 - \\lfloor 8x_0 \\rfloor = x_0$\n\nRearranging the terms to solve for $x_0$:\n$7x_0 = \\lfloor 8x_0 \\rfloor$\n\nSince $x_0$ is in the interval $[0, 1)$, the term $8x_0$ is in the interval $[0, 8)$. Therefore, the integer part $\\lfloor 8x_0 \\rfloor$ can take any integer value from 0 to 7, inclusive. Let's denote this integer by $k$, so $k = \\lfloor 8x_0 \\rfloor$.\nOur equation becomes:\n$7x_0 = k$, which means $x_0 = \\frac{k}{7}$.\n\nThe possible values for $k$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$. However, since $x_0  1$, we must have $k/7  1$, which means $k  7$. So, $k$ can be any integer from 0 to 6.\nThis gives the following possible values for $x_0$:\n$x_0 \\in \\left\\{ 0, \\frac{1}{7}, \\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{3}{7}, \\frac{4}{7}, \\frac{5}{7}, \\frac{6}{7} \\right\\}$\n\nNow we must ensure the period is a *prime* period of 3. This means the orbit should not be of period 1. A period-1 orbit (a fixed point) satisfies $f(x_0) = x_0$. Let's find these fixed points.\n$f(x_0) = 2x_0 \\pmod 1 = x_0$\n$2x_0 - \\lfloor 2x_0 \\rfloor = x_0$\n$x_0 = \\lfloor 2x_0 \\rfloor$\nSince $x_0 \\in [0, 1)$, $2x_0 \\in [0, 2)$, so $\\lfloor 2x_0 \\rfloor$ can be 0 or 1.\nIf $\\lfloor 2x_0 \\rfloor = 0$, then $x_0 = 0$. This is a valid solution.\nIf $\\lfloor 2x_0 \\rfloor = 1$, then $x_0 = 1$, but $x_0$ must be in the interval $[0, 1)$, so this is not a valid solution.\nThe only fixed point is $x_0 = 0$.\n\nOut of our set of solutions for $f^3(x_0)=x_0$, we must exclude $x_0=0$ because it has a period of 1, not 3. All other solutions must therefore have a prime period of 3. (A point of period $p$ satisfying $f^n(x)=x$ must have $p$ be a divisor of $n$. Here $n=3$, so the prime period can only be 1 or 3. Since we excluded the period-1 case, the remaining points must have period 3).\n\nThe positive solutions are $\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{7}, \\frac{2}{7}, \\frac{3}{7}, \\frac{4}{7}, \\frac{5}{7}, \\frac{6}{7} \\right\\}$.\nThe problem asks for the smallest positive initial condition. This corresponds to the smallest positive value of $k$, which is $k=1$.\nFor $k=1$, we get $x_0 = \\frac{1}{7}$.\n\nLet's verify the orbit for $x_0 = 1/7$:\n$x_0 = \\frac{1}{7}$\n$x_1 = f(\\frac{1}{7}) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{2}{7}$\n$x_2 = f(\\frac{2}{7}) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{4}{7}$\n$x_3 = f(\\frac{4}{7}) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{8}{7} = 1 + \\frac{1}{7} \\implies x_3 = \\frac{1}{7}$\nSo $x_3 = x_0$. The points $x_0=\\frac{1}{7}$, $x_1=\\frac{2}{7}$, and $x_2=\\frac{4}{7}$ are all distinct and not equal to the fixed point 0. Thus, $x_0 = 1/7$ generates a periodic orbit of prime period 3.\n\nThe smallest positive initial condition is therefore $\\frac{1}{7}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}}$$", "id": "1720618"}, {"introduction": "Expanding to two dimensions allows us to visualize the fate of a system in a phase portrait, where initial conditions are partitioned into basins of attraction.
