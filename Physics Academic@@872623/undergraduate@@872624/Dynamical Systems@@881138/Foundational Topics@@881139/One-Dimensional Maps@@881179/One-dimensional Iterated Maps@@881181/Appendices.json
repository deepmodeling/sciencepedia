A fixed point $x^*$ satisfies the condition $f(x^*) = x^*$.\nSubstituting $x^*=0$ into the map function:\n$$f(0) = 0 - 0^3 = 0$$\nSince $f(0) = 0$, $x^*=0$ is indeed a fixed point.\n\nTo analyze the stability of the fixed point, we first attempt linear stability analysis by examining the derivative of $f(x)$ at the fixed point.\nThe function is $f(x) = x - x^3$.\nIts derivative is $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x - x^3) = 1 - 3x^2$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the derivative at the fixed point $x^*=0$:\n$$f'(0) = 1 - 3(0)^2 = 1$$\n\nThe linear stability criterion states:\n- If $|f'(x^*)|  1$, the fixed point is stable (attracting).\n- If $|f'(x^*)|  1$, the fixed point is unstable (repelling).\n- If $|f'(x^*)| = 1$, the fixed point is non-hyperbolic, and linear stability analysis is inconclusive. A more detailed analysis is required.\n\nSince $f'(0) = 1$, we have a non-hyperbolic fixed point. We must analyze the behavior of the iterates directly or graphically (e.g., using a cobweb plot). Let's analyze the behavior of iterates for an initial condition $x_0$ that is small but non-zero.\n\nCase 1: $x_n$ is a small positive number.\nLet $x_n = \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive number ($0  \\epsilon \\ll 1$).\nThe next iterate is $x_{n+1} = f(x_n) = f(\\epsilon) = \\epsilon - \\epsilon^3$.\nSince $\\epsilon  0$, $\\epsilon^3$ is also positive. Therefore, $x_{n+1} = \\epsilon - \\epsilon^3  \\epsilon = x_n$.\nAlso, since $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, we have $\\epsilon^2 \\ll 1$, which means $1 - \\epsilon^2  0$.\nWe can write $x_{n+1} = \\epsilon(1 - \\epsilon^2)$. Since both $\\epsilon$ and $(1 - \\epsilon^2)$ are positive, their product $x_{n+1}$ is also positive.\nSo, for a small positive $x_n$, the next iterate $x_{n+1}$ is also positive but smaller than $x_n$. This means the sequence of iterates, starting from a small positive $x_0$, will be a monotonically decreasing sequence of positive numbers. The only value it can converge to is the fixed point $x^*=0$. The trajectory approaches the origin from the right side without crossing it.\n\nCase 2: $x_n$ is a small negative number.\nLet $x_n = -\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive number ($0  \\epsilon \\ll 1$).\nThe next iterate is $x_{n+1} = f(x_n) = f(-\\epsilon) = (-\\epsilon) - (-\\epsilon)^3 = -\\epsilon + \\epsilon^3$.\nSince $\\epsilon  0$, $\\epsilon^3$ is also positive. Therefore, $x_{n+1} = -\\epsilon + \\epsilon^3  -\\epsilon = x_n$.\nAs in Case 1, for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, we have $1 - \\epsilon^2  0$.\nWe can write $x_{n+1} = -\\epsilon(1 - \\epsilon^2)$. Since $\\epsilon  0$ and $(1 - \\epsilon^2)  0$, their product is positive, and thus $x_{n+1}$ is negative.\nSo, for a small negative $x_n$, the next iterate $x_{n+1}$ is also negative but larger (less negative) than $x_n$. This means the sequence of iterates, starting from a small negative $x_0$, will be a monotonically increasing sequence of negative numbers. It will converge to the fixed point $x^*=0$. The trajectory approaches the origin from the left side without crossing it.\n\nIn both cases, the system state $x_n$ approaches the equilibrium point $x=0$ monotonically. It does not oscillate around the origin (ruling out B) nor is it repelled (ruling out A). The convergence to a fixed point rules out a 2-cycle (D) and chaotic behavior (E).
