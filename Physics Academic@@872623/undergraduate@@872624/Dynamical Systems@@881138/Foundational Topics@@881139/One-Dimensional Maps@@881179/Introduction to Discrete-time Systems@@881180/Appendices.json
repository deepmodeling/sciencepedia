The simplest and most fundamental case is the first-order discrete system, where the next state depends only on the current one. This exercise explores the concept of a fixed point, an equilibrium state where the system ceases to change, and introduces the critical idea of stability—whether the system returns to this equilibrium after a small push. Mastering this analysis for a simple linear model, as in this problem [@problem_id:1685804], provides the essential foundation for studying more complex dynamical phenomena.", "problem": "A biochemical process in a chemostat involves a substance whose concentration is regulated on an hourly basis. Let $C_n$ represent the concentration of the substance in grams per liter (g/L) at the end of hour $n$.
