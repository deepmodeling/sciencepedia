The design is based on a self-similar iterative process. An initial geometric shape is replaced by a collection of $N$ smaller, identical copies of itself. Each of these copies is scaled down by a linear factor of $r = 1/2$ compared to the previous generation's shape. This process is repeated indefinitely to generate the final fractal structure.\n\nFor such a construction, the 'space-filling' characteristic is quantified by a value called the similarity dimension, denoted by $D_s$. The similarity dimension is defined as the value $D_s$ that satisfies the equation $N r^{D_s} = 1$. For the antenna to have the desired broadband reception properties, its similarity dimension must be greater than the dimension of a flat plane, i.e., $D_s > 2$.\n\nDetermine the smallest integer number of copies, $N$, that must be used in each iterative step to ensure the antenna's similarity dimension meets this requirement.", "solution": "The similarity dimension is defined by the self-similarity relation $N r^{D_{s}} = 1$.
