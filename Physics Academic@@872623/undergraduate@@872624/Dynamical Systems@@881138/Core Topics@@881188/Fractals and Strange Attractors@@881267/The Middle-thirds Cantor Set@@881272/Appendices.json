It is constructed iteratively. We begin with the set $C_0 = [0, 1]$. To get the next set in the sequence, $C_1$, we remove the open middle third of $C_0$, which gives $C_1 = [0, 1/3] \\cup [2/3, 1]$. To get $C_2$, we remove the open middle third from each of the two intervals in $C_1$, resulting in $C_2 = [0, 1/9] \\cup [2/9, 1/3] \\cup [2/3, 7/9] \\cup [8/9, 1]$.
