The process begins at step $k=0$ with a single vertical line segment of length $L_0$.\n\nIn each subsequent step, every line segment present in the structure is replaced by a new pattern of three smaller segments. Specifically, a segment of length $L$ is replaced by the following three-segment arrangement:\n1.  A central segment of length $L/2$, oriented in the same direction as the original segment and starting from the same base point.\n2.  Two branching segments, each also of length $L/2$. These two segments start from the top endpoint of the new central segment (from part 1). One branch extends at an angle of $60^\\circ$ to the left of the central segment's direction, and the other extends at an angle of $60^\\circ$ to the right of the central segment's direction.\n\nThis iterative process, when continued infinitely, generates a fractal object. Calculate the similarity dimension of this fractal. Express your answer in its exact analytical form.", "solution": "The similarity dimension, often denoted as $D_s$, is a measure used to characterize self-similar fractals. It is calculated using the formula:\n$$\nD_s = \\frac{\\ln(N)}{\\ln(1/r)}\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of non-overlapping, self-similar copies that an object can be broken down into, and $r$ is the scaling factor required to shrink the whole object to the size of one of these copies.\n\nWe need to identify the values of $N$ and $r$ from the problem description.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of copies, $N$. The problem states that in each step of the iteration, \"every line segment present in the structure is replaced by a new pattern of three smaller segments.\" This means that one single segment (the \"whole\" at that scale) is replaced by a structure composed of three smaller, similar segments. Therefore, the number of self-similar copies is $N=3$.\n\nNext, let's determine the scaling factor, $r$. The problem specifies that a segment of length $L$ is replaced by new segments, each of length $L/2$. This means that to scale the original segment of length $L$ down to the size of one of the new constituent segments (length $L/2$), we must multiply its length by a factor of $1/2$. Thus, the linear scaling factor is $r = 1/2$.\n\nThe information about the angles ($60^\\circ$) is a geometric detail that determines the visual appearance of the fractal. However, it does not affect the calculation of the similarity dimension, which depends only on the number of copies and the scaling factor.\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of $N$ and $r$ into the formula for the similarity dimension:\n$$\nD_s = \\frac{\\ln(N)}{\\ln(1/r)} = \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(1/(1/2))}\n$$\nSimplifying the denominator:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1/2}\\right) = \\ln(2)\n$$\nSo, the similarity dimension is:\n$$\nD_s = \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the similarity dimension.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)}}$$", "id": "1678109"}, {"introduction": "Fractal structures are not limited to geometric constructions; they can also be defined through more abstract, number-theoretic rules.

However, the number $1/2 = 2/4 = 0.2_4$ is not in $S$ as its standard base-4 expansion includes the digit 2. Note that some numbers have multiple base-4 representations (e.g., $1/4 = 0.1_4 = 0.0333..._4$).
