From $\\dot{y} = -x = 0$ we obtain $x=0$, and then $\\dot{x} = y + 0 = y = 0$. Hence the only fixed point is $(0,0)$.\n\nTo classify the fixed point, compute the Jacobian\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}}{\\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\dot{y}}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial \\dot{y}}{\\partial y}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 - 12x^2  1 \\\\\n-1  0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nAt $(0,0)$,\n$$\nJ(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe characteristic polynomial is\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\lambda  1 \\\\ -1  -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n= (1-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (-1)(1) = \\lambda^2 - \\lambda + 1.\n$$\nThe discriminant is $(-1)^2 - 4 = -3  0$, and the trace is $1>0$, determinant $1>0$. Therefore the eigenvalues are complex with positive real part, so $(0,0)$ is an unstable spiral (focus). Hence statement A, which claims a stable spiral, is false.\n\nNext, compute the nullclines. The $x$-nullcline is given by $\\dot{x}=0$, i.e.,\n$$\ny + x(1 - 4x^2) = 0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad y = 4x^3 - x.\n$$\nThe $y$-nullcline is given by $\\dot{y}=0$, i.e.,\n$$\n-x = 0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad x = 0.\n$$\nThus the $x$-nullcline is the cubic $y=4x^3-x$ and the $y$-nullcline is the $y$-axis.

Hence the $y$-axis is not invariant; only the equilibrium remains there. Statement B is false.\n\nNow examine statement E about the region $x>1$. To remain in $x>1$, trajectories would have to be prevented from crossing the line $x=1$ from right to left. On the line $x=1$,\n$$\n\\dot{x} = y + 1(1 - 4) = y - 3.\n$$\nFor any point with $y3$ on $x=1$, we have $\\dot{x}0$, so the flow points to the left, allowing trajectories to cross into $x1$ in forward time.

Then:\n- $F$ is odd with exactly one positive zero at $a = 1/2$; indeed $F(x) = x(4x^2 - 1)$, so $F(x)  0$ for $0  x  1/2$ and $F(x) > 0$ for $x > 1/2$.\n- For $x > 1/2$, $f(x) = F'(x) = 12x^2 - 1 > 0$, so $F$ is strictly increasing there.\n- $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} F(x) = \\infty$.\n\nThese satisfy the standard hypotheses of the Liénard theorem (with $g$ odd and increasing, $f$ even, and $F$ possessing a unique positive zero beyond which it increases to infinity). Therefore, the system has a unique stable limit cycle surrounding the origin. Since the equilibrium at the origin is an unstable spiral, the limit cycle is attracting.
