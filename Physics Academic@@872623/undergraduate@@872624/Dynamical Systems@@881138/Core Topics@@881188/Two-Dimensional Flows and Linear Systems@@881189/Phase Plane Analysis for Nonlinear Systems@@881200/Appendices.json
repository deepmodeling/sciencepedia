The rate of change of the fish population, $N(t)$, is given by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) - h $$\nHere, $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate of the fish, $K$ is the carrying capacity of the lake, and $h$ is the constant rate at which fish are harvested. All parameters $r$, $K$, and $h$ are positive constants.\n\nAn equilibrium population is a value of $N$ for which the population size does not change over time. As the harvesting rate $h$ is increased from zero, the number of possible equilibrium populations changes. There exists a critical harvesting rate, $h_c$, at which the fishery transitions from having two positive equilibrium populations to having none.
