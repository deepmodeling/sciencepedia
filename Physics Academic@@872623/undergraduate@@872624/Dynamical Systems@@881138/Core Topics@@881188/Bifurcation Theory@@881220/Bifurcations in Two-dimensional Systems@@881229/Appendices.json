The $x$-equilibrium condition is\n$$\n\\mu + x - \\exp(x) = 0,\n$$\nwhich can be written as\n$$\n\\mu = \\exp(x) - x.\n$$\nThus equilibria are all points $(x^{*},0)$ with $x^{*}$ satisfying $\\mu=\\exp(x^{*})-x^{*}$.\n\nTo detect a bifurcation as $\\mu$ varies, analyze the number of solutions of $\\mu=\\exp(x)-x$ as a function of $\\mu$. Consider $\\mu(x)=\\exp(x)-x$. Its derivative is\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu}{dx}=\\exp(x)-1,\n$$\nand its second derivative is\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}\\mu}{dx^{2}}=\\exp(x)0.\n$$\nHence $\\mu(x)$ is strictly convex and has a unique critical point where $\\exp(x)-1=0$, namely at $x=0$. This critical point is a global minimum. The minimum value is\n$$\n\\mu_{\\min}=\\mu(0)=\\exp(0)-0=1.\n$$\nTherefore:\n- If $\\mu1$, the equation $\\mu=\\exp(x)-x$ has two distinct solutions $x^{*}$ (one with $x^{*}0$ and one with $x^{*}0$).\n- If $\\mu=1$, there is exactly one solution at $x^{*}=0$ of multiplicity two (a tangential intersection).\n- If $\\mu1$, there are no real solutions.\n\nThis change in the number of equilibria at $\\mu=1$ indicates a saddle-node bifurcation.

This verifies a saddle-node bifurcation at $\\mu=1$.\n\nFor completeness, we examine stability in the full two-dimensional system.

For $\\mu1$, the larger root has $x^{*}0$, giving $\\lambda_{1}0$, so both eigenvalues are negative and the equilibrium is a stable node; the smaller root has $x^{*}0$, giving $\\lambda_{1}0$, so one eigenvalue is positive and the equilibrium is a saddle. At $\\mu=1$, $x^{*}=0$ and $\\lambda_{1}=0$, $\\lambda_{2}=-1$, a nonhyperbolic equilibrium characteristic of a saddle-node collision.
