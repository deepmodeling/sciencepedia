Express your final answer in millimeters (mm) and round it to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the distance between Particle A and Particle B at the time of Particle A's first collision. Let's denote this time by $t_A$. The overall strategy is to determine the trajectories of both particles, find the time $t_A$, and then calculate the positions of both particles, $\\vec{r}_A(t_A)$ and $\\vec{r}_B(t_A)$, at this specific instant to find the distance between them.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the motion of Particle A in the circular Enclosure A. It starts at the origin $(0,0)$ with an initial velocity $\\vec{v}_0 = v_0(\\cos\\alpha, \\sin\\alpha)$. Its position as a function of time $t$ is given by the linear trajectory $\\vec{r}_A(t) = (v_0 t \\cos\\alpha, v_0 t \\sin\\alpha)$, as long as it has not collided with the boundary.\n\nA collision occurs when the particle's distance from the origin equals the radius $R$. The magnitude of the position vector is $|\\vec{r}_A(t)| = \\sqrt{(v_0 t \\cos\\alpha)^2 + (v_0 t \\sin\\alpha)^2} = \\sqrt{(v_0 t)^2 (\\cos^2\\alpha + \\sin^2\\alpha)} = v_0 t$. The first collision for Particle A therefore happens when $v_0 t = R$. This gives the collision time $t_A = \\frac{R}{v_0}$.\nAt this time, the position of Particle A is:\n$\\vec{r}_A(t_A) = (v_0 \\frac{R}{v_0} \\cos\\alpha, v_0 \\frac{R}{v_0} \\sin\\alpha) = (R\\cos\\alpha, R\\sin\\alpha)$.\n\nNext, we analyze the motion of Particle B in the flattened Enclosure B. It starts with the same initial conditions, so its trajectory is initially $\\vec{r}_B(t) = (v_0 t \\cos\\alpha, v_0 t \\sin\\alpha)$. The boundary of Enclosure B is a circular arc for $x < d$ and a vertical line at $x=d$. Since $\\alpha$ is a small positive angle, the particle moves into the first quadrant. It will hit the vertical wall at $x=d$ if it reaches this x-coordinate before hitting the circular part of the boundary.\n\nThe particle reaches the line $x=d$ at a time $t_B$ when its x-coordinate satisfies $v_0 t_B \\cos\\alpha = d$. This gives $t_B = \\frac{d}{v_0 \\cos\\alpha}$.\nAt this time, the y-coordinate is $y_B(t_B) = v_0 t_B \\sin\\alpha = v_0 (\\frac{d}{v_0 \\cos\\alpha}) \\sin\\alpha = d\\tan\\alpha$.\nFor this collision to occur on the flat wall, this y-coordinate must be within the wall's vertical extent, i.e., $|y_B(t_B)| \\le \\sqrt{R^2 - d^2}$. We will verify this condition later with the numerical values.\n\nLet's compare the collision times $t_A$ and $t_B$. We have $t_A = R/v_0$ and $t_B = d/(v_0\\cos\\alpha)$. Using the given values, $R > d$. Also, for a small angle $\\alpha$, $\\cos\\alpha$ is slightly less than 1. Specifically, $R\\cos\\alpha = 1.000 \\times \\cos(0.050) \\approx 0.99875$ m, which is greater than $d=0.990$ m. So, $R\\cos\\alpha > d$, which implies $\\frac{R}{v_0} > \\frac{d}{v_0\\cos\\alpha}$, so $t_A > t_B$. This means Particle B collides with its boundary first.\n\nAt its collision point, $\\vec{p}_B = (d, d\\tan\\alpha)$, Particle B has an incoming velocity $\\vec{v}_0 = v_0(\\cos\\alpha, \\sin\\alpha)$. The collision is with a vertical wall whose normal vector is $\\hat{n} = (-1, 0)$. For an elastic collision, the velocity component parallel to the surface (y-component) is unchanged, and the component perpendicular to the surface (x-component) is reversed. The outgoing velocity is therefore $\\vec{v}'_B = v_0(-\\cos\\alpha, \\sin\\alpha)$.\n\nWe need to find the position of Particle B at time $t_A$. After its bounce at $t_B$, it travels for a time duration $\\Delta t = t_A - t_B = \\frac{R}{v_0} - \\frac{d}{v_0 \\cos\\alpha}$ with the new velocity $\\vec{v}'_B$.\nThe position of Particle B at time $t_A$ is its position at the bounce plus the subsequent displacement:\n$\\vec{r}_B(t_A) = \\vec{p}_B + \\vec{v}'_B \\Delta t$\n\nThe x-coordinate is:\n$x_B(t_A) = d + (-v_0\\cos\\alpha) \\left(\\frac{R}{v_0} - \\frac{d}{v_0 \\cos\\alpha}\\right) = d - R\\cos\\alpha + d = 2d - R\\cos\\alpha$.\n\nThe y-coordinate is:\n$y_B(t_A) = d\\tan\\alpha + (v_0\\sin\\alpha) \\left(\\frac{R}{v_0} - \\frac{d}{v_0 \\cos\\alpha}\\right) = d\\tan\\alpha + R\\sin\\alpha - \\frac{d\\sin\\alpha}{\\cos\\alpha} = d\\tan\\alpha + R\\sin\\alpha - d\\tan\\alpha = R\\sin\\alpha$.\n\nSo, at time $t_A$, the position of Particle B is $\\vec{r}_B(t_A) = (2d - R\\cos\\alpha, R\\sin\\alpha)$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the distance $\\Delta s$ between Particle A and Particle B at time $t_A$.\n$\\Delta s = |\\vec{r}_A(t_A) - \\vec{r}_B(t_A)| = \\sqrt{(R\\cos\\alpha - (2d - R\\cos\\alpha))^2 + (R\\sin\\alpha - R\\sin\\alpha)^2}$\n$\\Delta s = \\sqrt{(2R\\cos\\alpha - 2d)^2 + 0^2} = |2(R\\cos\\alpha - d)|$.\nSince we have already shown that $R\\cos\\alpha > d$, the argument of the absolute value is positive.\n$\\Delta s = 2(R\\cos\\alpha - d)$.\n\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values: $R = 1.000 \\text{ m}$, $d = 0.990 \\text{ m}$, and $\\alpha = 0.050 \\text{ radians}$.\nFirst, we verify that Particle B hits the flat wall:\nThe collision y-coordinate is $y_{hit} = d\\tan\\alpha = 0.990 \\times \\tan(0.050) \\approx 0.990 \\times 0.0500417 \\approx 0.0495$ m.\nThe maximum height of the flat wall is $y_{max} = \\sqrt{R^2 - d^2} = \\sqrt{1.000^2 - 0.990^2} = \\sqrt{0.0199} \\approx 0.141$ m.\nSince $y_{hit} < y_{max}$, the particle does indeed collide with the flat portion of the boundary.\n\nNow we calculate the distance $\\Delta s$:\n$\\Delta s = 2(1.000 \\times \\cos(0.050) - 0.990)$.\nUsing a calculator for $\\cos(0.050) \\approx 0.99875026$.\n$\\Delta s \\approx 2(1.000 \\times 0.99875026 - 0.990) = 2(0.99875026 - 0.990) = 2(0.00875026) = 0.01750052 \\text{ m}$.\n\nThe question asks for the answer in millimeters (mm), rounded to three significant figures.\n$\\Delta s = 0.01750052 \\text{ m} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ mm}}{1 \\text{ m}} = 17.50052 \\text{ mm}$.\nRounding to three significant figures gives $17.5$ mm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{17.5}$$", "id": "2079406"}, {"introduction": "Sensitivity to initial conditions is not always about trajectories flying apart in space; it can also manifest as extreme changes in time-dependent quantities.
