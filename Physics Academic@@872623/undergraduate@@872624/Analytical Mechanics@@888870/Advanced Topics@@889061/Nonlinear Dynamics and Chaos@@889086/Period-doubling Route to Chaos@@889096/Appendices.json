A famous example is the logistic map, $f(x) = r x (1-x)$, which for certain ranges of the parameter $r$ exhibits a period-doubling route to chaos. This means that as $r$ is increased, the long-term behavior of the system transitions from a stable fixed point to a stable 2-cycle, then a 4-cycle, an 8-cycle, and so on, eventually leading to chaotic dynamics.\n\nNow, consider a much simpler linear map, described by the first-order recurrence relation $x_{n+1} = \\lambda x_n$, where $\\lambda$ is a real-valued parameter analogous to $r$. Despite its structural similarity, this linear system is fundamentally incapable of exhibiting a period-doubling cascade or chaos, regardless of the value of $\\lambda$.\n\nWhich of the following statements identifies the core mathematical reason for the absence of a period-doubling route to chaos in the linear map $x_{n+1} = \\lambda x_n$?\n\nA. The linear map possesses only one fixed point for any value of $\\lambda$, while chaotic systems must have at least two.\n\nB. The rate of divergence from or convergence to a fixed point, determined by the map's derivative, is constant and independent of the system's state variable $x$.\n\nC. The linear map is not guaranteed to keep trajectories bounded, and chaos can only occur in bounded systems.\n\nD. For the linear map, a stable cycle with a period greater than one is mathematically impossible.\n\nE. The linear map is always invertible for $\\lambda \\neq 0$, whereas chaotic maps must be non-invertible.", "solution": "We analyze the linear map $f(x)=\\lambda x$ and its iterates and stability to identify why it cannot undergo period-doubling or chaos.\n\nFirst, compute the derivative of the map:\n$$\nf'(x)=\\lambda,\n$$\nwhich is a constant independent of $x$. Consequently, the $n$-th iterate is\n$$\nf^{n}(x)=\\lambda^{n} x,\n$$\nand its derivative is\n$$\n\\left(f^{n}\\right)'(x)=\\lambda^{n},\n$$\nwhich is also constant and independent of $x$.\n\nFixed points satisfy $x^{*}=f(x^{*})$, i.e.\n$$\nx^{*}=\\lambda x^{*}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad (1-\\lambda)x^{*}=0.\n$$\nThus, for $\\lambda\\neq 1$, the only fixed point is $x^{*}=0$, and for $\\lambda=1$ every $x$ is a fixed point.\n\nStability of a fixed point is determined by the multiplier $|f'(x^{*})|=|\\lambda|$. Hence:\n- If $|\\lambda|1$, $x^{*}=0$ is attracting.\n- If $|\\lambda|1$, $x^{*}=0$ is repelling.\n- If $\\lambda=\\pm 1$, the fixed point is nonhyperbolic (neutral).\n\nA period-$m$ point $x$ satisfies $f^{m}(x)=x$ and $f^{k}(x)\\neq x$ for all positive integers $km$. For the linear map,\n$$\nf^{m}(x)=\\lambda^{m}x=x\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad (\\lambda^{m}-1)x=0.\n$$\nThus, a nonzero period-$m$ point requires $\\lambda^{m}=1$. For real $\\lambda$, this implies:\n- $\\lambda=1$ for any $m$, which gives fixed points only (not $m1$ cycles),\n- $\\lambda=-1$ when $m$ is even, yielding period-$2$ points when $x\\neq 0$.\n\nThe stability of a period-$m$ cycle is governed by the multiplier $|\\left(f^{m}\\right)'(x)|=|\\lambda^{m}|$. If $\\lambda=-1$ and $m=2$, then $|\\lambda^{2}|=1$, so the 2-cycles are neutral, not attracting. For $|\\lambda|1$, all points contract to $0$ and no nontrivial cycles exist. For $|\\lambda|1$, $|\\lambda^{m}|1$ for all $m\\geq 1$, so any periodic point (if it existed) would be repelling. Therefore, there are no stable cycles of period greater than one.\n\nPeriod-doubling bifurcations require the creation of a stable 2-cycle as a fixed point loses stability via a flip (with derivative crossing $-1$). Here, although the fixed point at $0$ loses stability as $|\\lambda|$ crosses $1$, the derivative being constant implies that no stable higher-period cycle is created. This failure is fundamentally due to the state-independent derivative: the map is linear, so the local rate of contraction or expansion does not vary with $x$, eliminating the nonlinear mechanism (stretching and folding with state dependence) necessary for period-doubling cascades.\n\nAmong the options, the statement that pinpoints this core mathematical reason is that the derivative (and thus local dynamics) is constant and independent of $x$, which is option B.
