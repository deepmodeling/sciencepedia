This is a non-inertial reference frame because the pod is accelerating relative to the ground (an inertial frame).\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system fixed to the pod. Let the origin be the point on the floor directly below the sphere's release point. Let the positive $y$-axis point vertically upwards, and the positive $x$-axis point horizontally in the direction of the pod's acceleration, $a$.
