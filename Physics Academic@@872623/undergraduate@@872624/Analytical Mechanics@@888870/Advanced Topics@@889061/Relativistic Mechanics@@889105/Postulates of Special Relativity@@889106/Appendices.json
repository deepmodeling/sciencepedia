This isn't just a theoretical curiosity; it has tangible consequences, particularly in particle physics, where unstable particles traveling near the speed of light are observed to exist for longer than their known proper lifetimes. This problem provides a concrete exercise in applying the time dilation formula to determine the speed a particle must achieve for its lifetime to be extended to a specific, measurable duration in a laboratory setting [@problem_id:2073044].", "problem": "In a high-energy physics experiment at the Advanced Relativistic Collider (ARC), a beam of newly discovered, unstable subatomic particles, called xi-mesons, is generated.
