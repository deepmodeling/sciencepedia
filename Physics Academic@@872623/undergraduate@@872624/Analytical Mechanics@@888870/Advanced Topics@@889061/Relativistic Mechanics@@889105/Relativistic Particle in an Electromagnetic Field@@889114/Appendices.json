The canonical momentum component $p_x$.**\nThe coordinate conjugate to $p_x$ is $x$. We check if the Hamiltonian $H$ depends on $x$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{2H} \\cdot c^2 \\cdot 2(p_y - qB_0x)(-qB_0) = -\\frac{c^2 qB_0(p_y - qB_0x)}{H}$$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} \\neq 0$, the canonical momentum $p_x$ is not conserved.

The Hamiltonian $H$.**\nA Hamiltonian is conserved if it does not explicitly depend on time, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = 0$. The expression for $H$ contains only coordinates and momenta, and the parameter $B_0$ is a constant. There is no explicit dependence on time $t$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = 0$$\nTherefore, the Hamiltonian $H$ (which represents the total energy of the particle) is a conserved quantity. So, option D is correct.\n\n**E. The relativistic kinetic energy $T$.**\nThere are two ways to determine if the kinetic energy is conserved.\n\nMethod 1: Physical Argument.\nThe force on the particle is the Lorentz force $\\vec{F} = q(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$. Since the scalar potential $\\phi=0$ and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is static, the electric field $\\vec{E} = -\\nabla\\phi - \\frac{\\partial\\vec{A}}{\\partial t} = 0$. The force is purely magnetic, $\\vec{F} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$. The rate at which this force does work on the particle (the power) is $P = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot \\vec{v}$. Since the cross product $\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}$ is orthogonal to $\\vec{v}$, their dot product is zero. Thus, $P=0$. According to the work-energy theorem (which holds in relativity), if no work is done on the particle, its kinetic energy must remain constant. So, the kinetic energy $T$ is conserved.\n\nMethod 2: Relation to the Hamiltonian.\nThe Hamiltonian $H$ represents the total energy. Since $\\phi=0$, $H$ is the total relativistic energy, $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$. We showed that in this case $H$ is conserved. The relativistic kinetic energy is defined as $T = E - m_0c^2 = (\\gamma - 1)m_0c^2$. Since we have already established that the Hamiltonian $H=E$ is conserved, it follows that $\\gamma$ is constant. Since $\\gamma$ is constant, the kinetic energy $T = (\\gamma-1)m_0c^2$ must also be constant.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the relativistic kinetic energy $T$ is conserved. So, option E is correct.\n\nIn summary, the conserved quantities are $p_y$, $p_z$, $H$, and $T$. The corresponding correct options are B, C, D, and E.

This problem explores the geometry of this motion by investigating how its radius and pitch are affected by an external impulse. This practice will strengthen your ability to relate the components of momentum to the specific shape of the particle's path [@problem_id:2077158].", "problem": "A particle with rest mass $m_0$ and charge $q$ moves in a vacuum where a uniform, constant magnetic field $\\vec{B} = B_0 \\hat{k}$ is present. The particle's initial trajectory is a helix. At time $t=0$, its motion is characterized by an initial kinetic energy $K_i$ and its velocity vector makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the magnetic field axis (the $\\hat{k}$-direction), where $0  \\alpha  \\pi/2$.\n\nThe particle then passes through a very thin planar region at $z=0$. Within this region, a transient, spatially uniform electric field, also oriented along the $\\hat{k}$-direction, is activated for an infinitesimally short duration. This interaction imparts a net momentum impulse of magnitude $I$ to the particle, directed along the positive $\\hat{k}$-direction. After passing through this region, the particle continues its motion in the magnetic field only.\n\nLet $R_i$ and $P_i$ be the radius and pitch, respectively, of the initial helical path, and let $R_f$ and $P_f$ be the radius and pitch of the final helical path. Determine the ratios $R_f/R_i$ and $P_f/P_i$. Provide your answer as two separate expressions, one for each ratio, in terms of $m_0$, $K_i$, $\\alpha$, $I$, and the speed of light in vacuum, $c$.", "solution": "The motion of a relativistic particle of charge $q$ and rest mass $m_0$ in an electromagnetic field is governed by the relativistic Lorentz force equation, $\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = q(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$, where $\\vec{p} = \\gamma m_0 \\vec{v}$ is the relativistic momentum and $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the helical motion in the uniform magnetic field $\\vec{B} = B_0 \\hat{k}$ alone. The momentum can be decomposed into a component parallel to the magnetic field, $\\vec{p}_\\parallel$, and a component perpendicular to it, $\\vec{p}_\\perp$. The magnetic force is $\\vec{F}_B = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$. This force is always perpendicular to $\\vec{B}$ and thus can only change the direction of $\\vec{p}_\\perp$, not its magnitude, and it has no effect on $\\vec{p}_\\parallel$. The force provides the centripetal acceleration for the circular component of the motion.\nThe magnitude of the centripetal force is given by the rate of change of the perpendicular momentum vector's direction: $|\\frac{d\\vec{p}_\\perp}{dt}| = \\omega p_\\perp = \\frac{v_\\perp}{R} p_\\perp$, where $R$ is the radius of the helix and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. The magnitude of the magnetic force is $|q|v_\\perp B_0$.\nEquating the two, $|q|v_\\perp B_0 = \\frac{v_\\perp}{R} p_\\perp$.\nSolving for the radius $R$, we get $R = \\frac{p_\\perp}{|q|B_0}$. This shows that the radius of the helical path is directly proportional to the magnitude of the perpendicular momentum.\n\nThe period of one revolution is $T = \\frac{2\\pi R}{v_\\perp}$. Substituting the expression for $R$, we have $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{|q|B_0} \\frac{p_\\perp}{v_\\perp}$. Since $p_\\perp = \\gamma m_0 v_\\perp$, we get $T = \\frac{2\\pi \\gamma m_0}{|q|B_0}$.\nThe pitch of the helix, $P$, is the distance traveled along the field axis in one period: $P = v_\\parallel T$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $v_\\parallel=p_\\parallel/(\\gamma m_0)$ and $T$, we get:\n$P = \\left(\\frac{p_\\parallel}{\\gamma m_0}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\gamma m_0}{|q|B_0}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi p_\\parallel}{|q|B_0}$.\nThis shows that the pitch of the helical path is directly proportional to the magnitude of the parallel momentum.\n\nNext, we analyze the effect of the transient electric field. The problem states that the particle receives a momentum impulse of magnitude $I$ along the positive $\\hat{k}$-direction. An impulse $\\vec{I}_{\\text{impulse}}$ is defined as the change in momentum, $\\Delta\\vec{p}$.\nSo, $\\Delta\\vec{p} = I \\hat{k}$.\nThis impulse only has a component in the $\\hat{k}$-direction. Therefore, it only changes the parallel component of the particle's momentum. The perpendicular component of the momentum remains unchanged.\nLet $\\vec{p}_i$ and $\\vec{p}_f$ be the initial and final momentum vectors.\n$p_{f,\\perp} = p_{i,\\perp}$\n$p_{f,\\parallel} = p_{i,\\parallel} + I$\n\nNow we can calculate the required ratios.\nThe ratio of the final radius to the initial radius is:\n$\\frac{R_f}{R_i} = \\frac{p_{f,\\perp} / (|q|B_0)}{p_{i,\\perp} / (|q|B_0)} = \\frac{p_{f,\\perp}}{p_{i,\\perp}}$.\nSince $p_{f,\\perp} = p_{i,\\perp}$, the ratio is $\\frac{R_f}{R_i} = 1$.\n\nThe ratio of the final pitch to the initial pitch is:\n$\\frac{P_f}{P_i} = \\frac{2\\pi p_{f,\\parallel} / (|q|B_0)}{2\\pi p_{i,\\parallel} / (|q|B_0)} = \\frac{p_{f,\\parallel}}{p_{i,\\parallel}}$.\nSubstituting $p_{f,\\parallel} = p_{i,\\parallel} + I$, we get:\n$\\frac{P_f}{P_i} = \\frac{p_{i,\\parallel} + I}{p_{i,\\parallel}} = 1 + \\frac{I}{p_{i,\\parallel}}$.\n\nTo complete the solution, we must express $p_{i,\\parallel}$ in terms of the given initial parameters: kinetic energy $K_i$ and angle $\\alpha$.\nThe total relativistic energy is $E = K + m_0c^2$. The energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\nFor the initial state, $E_i = K_i + m_0c^2$.\nSo, $(p_i c)^2 = E_i^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (K_i + m_0c^2)^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = K_i^2 + 2K_i m_0c^2$.\nThe magnitude of the initial momentum is $p_i = \\frac{1}{c}\\sqrt{K_i^2 + 2K_i m_0c^2} = \\frac{1}{c}\\sqrt{K_i(K_i + 2m_0c^2)}$.\n\nThe initial momentum vector makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the $\\hat{k}$-axis.
