This exercise provides a concrete path, a catenary curve, and asks for the velocity vector under a specific condition. By using the chain rule, you will practice connecting the geometric properties of a trajectory, given by $y(x)$, to the kinematic quantity of velocity, $\\vec{v} = (\\dot{x}, \\dot{y})$. This problem [@problem_id:2093270] solidifies the relationship between a path's slope and the components of velocity.", "problem": "A small, frictionless bead is constrained to slide along a stationary wire in a vertical plane described by the coordinate system $(x,y)$, where $y$ is the vertical direction. The shape of the wire is given by the catenary equation $y(x) = a \\cosh(x/a)$, where $a$ is a positive constant with units of length that determines the curvature of the wire. The bead moves in such a way that its horizontal velocity component is constant, given by $\\dot{x} = v_0$, where $v_0$ is a positive constant speed.\n\nDetermine the components of the bead's velocity vector, $\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)$, as a function of its horizontal position $x$ and the given parameters $a$ and $v_0$. Your answer should be presented as a row vector $(v_x, v_y)$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the components of the velocity vector $\\vec{v}$ of a bead moving along a specified path. The velocity vector is defined as $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt}$, where $\\vec{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$ is the position vector of the bead. The components of the velocity vector are therefore $v_x = \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\dot{x}$ and $v_y = \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\dot{y}$.\n\nWe are given the horizontal component of the velocity directly:\n$$v_x = \\dot{x} = v_0$$\nThis component is constant.\n\nTo find the vertical component of the velocity, $v_y = \\dot{y}$, we must find the time derivative of the vertical position $y$. The bead is constrained to move along the wire, so its coordinates must satisfy the equation $y(x) = a \\cosh(x/a)$. Since $y$ is given as a function of $x$, and $x$ is itself a function of time $t$, we can use the chain rule to find $\\frac{dy}{dt}$:\n$$v_y = \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{dy}{dx} \\frac{dx}{dt}$$\nWe already know $\\frac{dx}{dt} = v_0$. Now, we need to calculate the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$.\nThe path is given by $y(x) = a \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)$. We differentiate this with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[a \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)\\right]$$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation, with the derivative of $\\cosh(u)$ being $\\sinh(u)$, we get:\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = a \\cdot \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = a \\cdot \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{a}$$\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)$$\nNow we can substitute this result and $\\frac{dx}{dt} = v_0$ back into the expression for $v_y$:\n$$v_y = \\frac{dy}{dx} \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) \\cdot v_0$$\nSo, the vertical component of the velocity is $v_y = v_0 \\sinh(x/a)$.\n\nCombining the horizontal and vertical components, we obtain the velocity vector as a function of the horizontal position $x$:\n$$\\vec{v}(x) = (v_x, v_y) = \\left(v_0, v_0 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)\\right)$$\nThe components are expressed in terms of the given parameters $v_0$, $a$, and the variable $x$, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} v_0 & v_0 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2093270"}, {"introduction": "Beyond instantaneous velocity, we often need to know the total distance traveled along a curved path.
