The incline makes an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal, and the initial vertical height of the block above the base of the incline is $h$. The incline merges seamlessly with a frictionless horizontal track. A light, horizontal spring with a spring constant $k$ is fixed to a rigid wall at one end. The other end of the spring is free and is located at the point where the incline meets the horizontal track. Let this point define the origin of a coordinate system, $x=0$. The block slides down the incline, moves along the horizontal track, and collides with the free end of the spring. The collision is instantaneous, and the block becomes permanently attached to the spring. Subsequently, the block-spring system undergoes simple harmonic motion.\n\nDerive an expression for the amplitude of this simple harmonic motion in terms of $m$, $g$, $h$, and $k$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.", "solution": "The block starts from rest at vertical height $h$ above the base, so its initial mechanical energy is purely gravitational potential:\n$$\nE_{\\text{top}}=m g h.\n$$\nThe incline and track are frictionless, so mechanical energy is conserved during the slide. Just before contacting the spring at $x=0$ on the horizontal track, the block’s kinetic energy equals the lost potential energy:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_{0}^{2}=m g h \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_{0}=\\sqrt{2 g h}.\n$$\nAt the instant of attachment to the massless horizontal spring (taken as $t=0$), the block is at $x(0)=0$ and has velocity $v(0)=v_{0}$.

The system consists of a large, vertically-oriented, ideal spring placed at the bottom of the lift shaft. As part of a preliminary analysis, a lift car of mass $m$ is gently lowered onto the uncompressed spring until it comes to rest in equilibrium, at which point the spring is observed to have compressed by a distance $d$.\n\nFor the main safety test, the same lift car is released from rest at a height $h$ directly above the initial, uncompressed top of the spring. It falls and strikes the spring. Assume that air resistance and any other dissipative forces are negligible.

The only potential energies in the system are the spring potential energy and the gravitational potential energy. Static friction and the normal force from the fixed track do no work because, for rolling without slipping on a stationary track, the instantaneous velocity of the point of contact is zero, so the instantaneous power of the contact forces is zero.
