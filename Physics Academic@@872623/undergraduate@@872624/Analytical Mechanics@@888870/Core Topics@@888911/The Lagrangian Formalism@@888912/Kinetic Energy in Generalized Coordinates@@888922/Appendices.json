By analyzing a cylinder rolling inside another, you will practice combining the kinetic energy of the center of mass motion with the kinetic energy of rotation.

The axes of the two cylinders are parallel. The small cylinder rolls without slipping on the inner surface of the large cylinder under the influence of gravity. Let the position of the small cylinder be described by a single generalized coordinate, $\\theta$, which is the angle that the line connecting the centers of the two cylinders makes with the downward vertical.\n\nDetermine the total kinetic energy of the small cylindrical shell. Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of the given parameters $M$, $R$, and the generalized velocity $\\dot{\\theta}$.", "solution": "The total kinetic energy, $T$, of the rolling cylindrical shell is the sum of its translational kinetic energy, $T_{\\text{trans}}$, and its rotational kinetic energy, $T_{\\text{rot}}$, both measured with respect to the lab frame.\n$$T = T_{\\text{trans}} + T_{\\text{rot}}$$\n\nFirst, let's determine the translational kinetic energy, $T_{\\text{trans}} = \\frac{1}{2} M v_{\\text{cm}}^{2}$, where $v_{\\text{cm}}$ is the speed of the center of mass of the small cylinder.\nThe center of mass (CM) of the small cylinder moves in a circular path. The radius of this path is the difference between the radius of the large fixed cylinder and the radius of the small rolling cylinder.\n$$R_{\\text{path}} = 2R - R = R$$\nThe generalized coordinate $\\theta$ represents the angular position of the CM of the small cylinder along this circular path. The speed of the CM is therefore the radius of its path multiplied by its angular speed, $\\dot{\\theta}$.\n$$v_{\\text{cm}} = R_{\\text{path}} \\dot{\\theta} = R\\dot{\\theta}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for translational kinetic energy gives:\n$$T_{\\text{trans}} = \\frac{1}{2} M (R\\dot{\\theta})^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} M R^{2} \\dot{\\theta}^{2}$$\n\nNext, we determine the rotational kinetic energy, $T_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{1}{2} I_{\\text{cm}} \\omega^{2}$, where $I_{\\text{cm}}$ is the moment of inertia of the small cylinder about its central axis, and $\\omega$ is its angular speed of rotation about that axis.\nFor a uniform, thin-walled cylindrical shell, the moment of inertia about its central axis is:\n$$I_{\\text{cm}} = M R^{2}$$\nNow, we must relate the angular speed $\\omega$ to the generalized velocity $\\dot{\\theta}$ using the condition of rolling without slipping. The no-slip condition requires the velocity of the point of contact on the rolling body to be zero relative to the surface it is rolling on. Since the large cylinder is fixed, the absolute velocity of the contact point is zero.\nThe velocity of the contact point is the vector sum of the velocity of the center of mass, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{cm}}$, and the velocity of the contact point relative to the CM, which is $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_{\\text{contact/cm}}$.\nIn our setup, the speed of the CM is $v_{\\text{cm}} = R\\dot{\\theta}$ in the tangential direction. The speed of the contact point relative to the CM is $R\\omega$ in the opposite tangential direction. Thus, for the absolute speed of the contact point to be zero:\n$$v_{\\text{contact}} = v_{\\text{cm}} - R\\omega = 0$$\n$$R\\dot{\\theta} - R\\omega = 0 \\implies \\omega = \\dot{\\theta}$$\nNow we can calculate the rotational kinetic energy:\n$$T_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{1}{2} I_{\\text{cm}} \\omega^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (MR^{2})(\\dot{\\theta})^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} M R^{2} \\dot{\\theta}^{2}$$\n\nFinally, the total kinetic energy is the sum of the translational and rotational parts:\n$$T = T_{\\text{trans}} + T_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{1}{2} M R^{2} \\dot{\\theta}^{2} + \\frac{1}{2} M R^{2} \\dot{\\theta}^{2} = M R^{2} \\dot{\\theta}^{2}$$\nAlternatively, we can use the parallel axis theorem with respect to the instantaneous center of rotation (ICR), which is the contact point P. The kinetic energy of a body in planar motion is $T = \\frac{1}{2}I_P \\omega^2$, where $I_P$ is the moment of inertia about the ICR.\n$$I_P = I_{\\text{cm}} + M d^2 = MR^2 + M R^2 = 2MR^2$$\nThe total kinetic energy is then:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2} I_P \\omega^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (2MR^2) (\\dot{\\theta})^2 = MR^2 \\dot{\\theta}^2$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.
