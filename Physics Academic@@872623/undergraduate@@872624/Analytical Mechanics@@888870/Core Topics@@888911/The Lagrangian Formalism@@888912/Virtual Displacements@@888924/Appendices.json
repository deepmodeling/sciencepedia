The mechanism consists of two links, `AB` and `BC`, of equal length $L$. These links are joined by a frictionless pin at pivot `B`. End `A` of link `AB` is attached to a fixed frictionless pivot. End `C` of link `BC` is a slider that is constrained to move along a straight horizontal line that passes directly through the fixed pivot `A`.\n\nA downward vertical input force $F_{in}$ is applied at the central pivot `B`. In response, the slider at `C` moves horizontally and comes into contact with a workpiece, exerting a horizontal clamping force $F_{clamp}$ on it. The entire system is in a state of static equilibrium. The masses of the links are negligible, and all pivots are frictionless.\n\nIn the equilibrium configuration, both link `AB` and link `BC` make a small, non-zero angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal line of motion of the slider `C`.\n\nDetermine the mechanical advantage of the clamp, defined as the ratio of the clamping force to the input force, $F_{clamp} / F_{in}$.
