{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To analyze the motion of a mechanical system, our first task is to determine its degrees of freedom—the minimum number of independent coordinates needed to specify its configuration completely. This is achieved by systematically identifying and counting the constraints that restrict the system's motion. This exercise provides fundamental practice in translating physical restrictions, such as the rigidity of a body and its confinement to a plane, into a precise set of mathematical equations called holonomic constraints.", "problem": "A rigid, flat, non-degenerate triangular plate is analyzed in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The configuration of the plate is fully described by the coordinates of its three vertices, $\\vec{r}_1 = (x_1, y_1, z_1)$, $\\vec{r}_2 = (x_2, y_2, z_2)$, and $\\vec{r}_3 = (x_3, y_3, z_3)$. Initially, this system of nine coordinates is considered. The plate is then subjected to two sets of conditions: (1) the internal rigidity of the plate, meaning the distance between any two vertices is a fixed constant, and (2) an external constraint that forces the plate to lie and move exclusively within the horizontal $xy$-plane. Determine the total minimum number of independent holonomic equations required to mathematically represent both the internal rigidity and the external planar constraint.", "solution": "Let the generalized coordinates be the nine components of the three vertex position vectors,\n$$\nq=(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1},x_{2},y_{2},z_{2},x_{3},y_{3},z_{3}),\n$$\nso there are initially 9 degrees of freedom.\n\nInternal rigidity means the pairwise distances between vertices are fixed constants. For a non-degenerate triangle, there are exactly three edges, hence three holonomic constraints, which can be written as\n$$\nf_{12}=(\\vec{r}_{1}-\\vec{r}_{2})\\cdot(\\vec{r}_{1}-\\vec{r}_{2})-\\ell_{12}^{2}=0,\\quad\nf_{23}=(\\vec{r}_{2}-\\vec{r}_{3})\\cdot(\\vec{r}_{2}-\\vec{r}_{3})-\\ell_{23}^{2}=0,\\quad\nf_{31}=(\\vec{r}_{3}-\\vec{r}_{1})\\cdot(\\vec{r}_{3}-\\vec{r}_{1})-\\ell_{31}^{2}=0,\n$$\nwhere each $\\ell_{ij}$ is a fixed constant. These three constraints reduce the 9 coordinates to 6 degrees of freedom, as expected for a rigid body in three dimensions.\n\nThe external planar constraint that the plate lies and moves exclusively in the horizontal $xy$-plane is holonomic and is enforced by requiring each vertex to satisfy the plane equation $z=0$:\n$$\ng_{1}=z_{1}=0,\\quad g_{2}=z_{2}=0,\\quad g_{3}=z_{3}=0.\n$$\nThese are three independent constraints. They reduce the rigid body's 6 degrees of freedom to 3, corresponding to planar rigid-body motion (two in-plane translations and one in-plane rotation). Equivalently, they eliminate one translation (along the $z$-axis) and two rotations (tilts about the $x$- and $y$-axes).\n\nTherefore, the total minimum number of independent holonomic equations needed is the sum of the three internal rigidity constraints and the three planar constraints, giving\n$$\n3+3=6.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2042116"}, {"introduction": "Not all constraints can be expressed as simple algebraic equations of coordinates, as seen in the previous problem [@problem_id:2042116]. Some of the most interesting constraints in mechanics involve relationships between velocities, which may not be integrable into a position-based constraint. This exercise explores such a case, known as a nonholonomic constraint, using the intuitive example of a puck with a blade that cannot slip sideways. Mastering this concept is key to understanding the dynamics of rolling objects, vehicles, and many robotic systems.", "problem": "A small, self-steering robotic puck is designed to move on a large, flat horizontal surface, which we define as the $xy$-plane. The puck's position is given by coordinates $(x(t), y(t))$, and its orientation is described by an angle $\\theta(t)$, which is the angle its body makes with the positive $x$-axis, measured counter-clockwise. A sharp blade is fixed to the underside of the puck, aligned with its body. This blade imposes a physical constraint on the puck's motion: the puck cannot slip sideways. In other words, its velocity vector must always be aligned with its orientation.\n\nGiven that at a certain instant the puck has an orientation angle $\\theta$ and a velocity component along the x-axis of $\\dot{x}$, determine the corresponding velocity component along the y-axis, $\\dot{y}$. Express your answer as an analytic expression in terms of $\\dot{x}$ and $\\theta$.", "solution": "The blade enforces the non-slip lateral constraint: the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}=(\\dot{x},\\dot{y})$ must be aligned with the body orientation unit vector $\\hat{b}=(\\cos\\theta,\\sin\\theta)$.

This problem explores a unilateral constraint, where the force of constraint—in this case, the normal force from a surface—can only push, not pull. By analyzing the forces acting on a particle sliding down a hemisphere, you will determine the precise moment it loses contact. This classic exercise provides a powerful illustration of how the violation of a constraint is a dynamic event, governed by the interplay between geometry, gravity, and motion.", "problem": "A small particle of mass $m$ is placed at the very top (apex) of a fixed, frictionless hemisphere of radius $R$. The particle is given an infinitesimal horizontal velocity, causing it to slide down the curved surface. The interaction between the particle and the hemisphere's surface is described by a unilateral constraint, meaning the normal force exerted by the hemisphere on the particle can only be repulsive (pushing the particle away from the surface) or zero. The particle will eventually lose contact with the surface when this constraint is violated, i.e., when the required contact force would need to become attractive to maintain the circular path.\n\nLet $\\theta$ be the angle that the particle's position vector (with origin at the center of the hemisphere) makes with the vertical axis. At the apex, $\\theta = 0$. Determine the value of $\\cos(\\theta)$ at the precise moment the particle loses contact with the hemisphere's surface. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.", "solution": "Let the particle move on the outside of the fixed, frictionless hemisphere of radius $R$. Take the center of the hemisphere as origin and the vertical axis pointing upward. Let $\\theta$ be the angle between the position vector and the vertical, so $\\theta=0$ at the apex.\n\nWhile in contact, the motion is constrained to the spherical surface, so the speed satisfies energy conservation between the apex and a general angle $\\theta$. Taking the apex as the reference for potential energy, the vertical drop is $R(1-\\cos\\theta)$, hence\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2} = m g R (1 - \\cos\\theta),\n$$\nwhich gives\n$$\nv^{2} = 2 g R (1 - \\cos\\theta).\n$$\n\nApply Newton’s second law in the radial direction toward the center. Choose the inward radial direction as positive. The inward component of gravity is $m g \\cos\\theta$; the normal force $N$ from the surface on the particle is repulsive and points outward (away from the surface), i.e., opposite to the inward direction, so it contributes as $-N$.
