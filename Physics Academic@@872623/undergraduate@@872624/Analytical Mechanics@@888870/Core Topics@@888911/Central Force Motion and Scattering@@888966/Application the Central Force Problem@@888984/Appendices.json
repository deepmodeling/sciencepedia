The total energy $E$ is the sum of its kinetic energy $K$ and its potential energy $U$.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy $U$ of the probe of mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from the central star of mass $M$ is given by:\n$$U(r) = -\\frac{GMm}{r}$$\nwhere $G$ is the universal gravitational constant.\n\nThe kinetic energy $K$ of the probe moving at a speed $v$ is:\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\n\nThe total energy is therefore:\n$$E = K + U = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r}$$\n\nThe shape of the orbit depends on the sign of the total energy $E$:\n- If $E < 0$, the orbit is bound (an ellipse or a circle).\n- If $E = 0$, the orbit is a parabola. This is the minimum-energy condition for the probe to escape to infinity and have zero speed there.\n- If $E > 0$, the orbit is a hyperbola, and the probe escapes to infinity with some non-zero final speed.\n\nThe problem states that the probe is placed on a parabolic trajectory. This directly implies that its total mechanical energy must be zero. The burn occurs instantaneously when the probe is at its orbital radius $R_0$. We need to find the speed $v_f$ at this exact moment that satisfies the condition $E=0$.\n\nAt the point immediately after the burn, the probe's distance from the star is $r=R_0$ and its speed is $v=v_f$.

First, move the potential energy term to the other side of the equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 = \\frac{GMm}{R_0}$$\n\nWe can cancel the mass of the probe, $m$, from both sides:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}v_f^2 = \\frac{GM}{R_0}$$\n\nNext, multiply both sides by 2:\n$$v_f^2 = \\frac{2GM}{R_0}$$\n\nFinally, take the square root of both sides to find the speed $v_f$. Since speed must be non-negative, we take the positive root:\n$$v_f = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R_0}}$$\n\nThis speed is known as the escape velocity from a distance $R_0$.
