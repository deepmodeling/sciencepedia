This is the escape velocity of the two-body system. The condition for escape is that the total mechanical energy of the system, when analyzed in the center-of-mass (CM) frame, must be zero.\n\nThe motion of a two-body system can be simplified by transforming into the CM frame.

By applying the conservation of angular momentum at the points of closest and farthest approach (periapsis and apoapsis), you will derive a fundamental relationship between the orbital speeds and the orbit's eccentricity, $e$.", "problem": "Consider a system of two bodies interacting via a central gravitational force, which can be described by the motion of a single particle with reduced mass $\\mu$ in a potential $U(r) = -k/r$, where $k$ is a positive constant.
