Each specific value of energy corresponds to a unique trajectory, or contour, on the phase space portrait. This exercise provides a concrete application of the principle of conservation of energy in a system analogous to a simple pendulum, helping you connect the initial state (position and velocity) to a final state by understanding how potential energy is converted into kinetic energy along the trajectory.

The hoop is fixed in place within a region of space containing both a uniform gravitational field of magnitude $g$ pointing vertically downwards, and a uniform electric field of magnitude $E_0$ pointing horizontally to the right. The parameters are chosen such that the magnitude of the total electric force on the bead, $qE_0$, is exactly equal to the magnitude of the total gravitational force on it, $mg$.\n\nThe bead is initially held at rest at the highest point of the hoop and is then released.\n\nDetermine an expression for the magnitude of the bead's angular velocity the first time it reaches the lowest point of the hoop. Express your answer in terms of the given parameters $g$ and $R$.", "solution": "The problem can be solved using the principle of conservation of mechanical energy. Since the gravitational force and the static electric field are both conservative forces, and the normal force from the frictionless hoop does no work, the total mechanical energy of the bead is conserved.\n\nFirst, let's establish a coordinate system and define the potential energy. Let the origin $(0,0)$ be at the center of the circular hoop. Let the $\\hat{i}$ direction be horizontal and to the right, and the $\\hat{j}$ direction be vertical and upwards. The angular position of the bead on the hoop can be described by an angle $\\theta$, measured clockwise from the upward vertical axis. In this system:\n- The highest point of the hoop corresponds to $\\theta = 0$.\n- The lowest point of the hoop corresponds to $\\theta = \\pi$.\n- The position vector of the bead is $\\vec{r}(\\theta) = R\\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{i} + R\\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{j}$.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy $U_g$ is given by $U_g = mgy$, where $y = R\\cos\\theta$. We can set the reference potential $U_g=0$ at $y=0$ (the horizontal diameter). Thus,\n$$U_g(\\theta) = mgR\\cos\\theta$$\n\nThe uniform electric field is $\\vec{E} = E_0 \\, \\hat{i}$. The electric potential is $V = -\\vec{E} \\cdot \\vec{r} = -E_0 x$, where $x = R\\sin\\theta$. The electric potential energy $U_e$ is $U_e = qV$. We can set the reference potential $U_e=0$ at $x=0$ (the vertical diameter). Thus,\n$$U_e(\\theta) = -qE_0 R\\sin\\theta$$\n\nThe total potential energy $U(\\theta)$ is the sum of the gravitational and electric potential energies:\n$$U(\\theta) = U_g(\\theta) + U_e(\\theta) = mgR\\cos\\theta - qE_0 R\\sin\\theta$$\nThe problem states that $qE_0 = mg$. Substituting this into the expression for total potential energy gives:\n$$U(\\theta) = mgR(\\cos\\theta - \\sin\\theta)$$\n\nThe kinetic energy $T$ of the bead is given by $T = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Since the bead moves on a circle of radius $R$, its speed is $v = R|\\dot{\\theta}|$, where $\\dot{\\theta}$ is the angular velocity. So, the kinetic energy is:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2}m(R\\dot{\\theta})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}mR^2\\dot{\\theta}^2$$\n\nThe total mechanical energy is $E = T + U$.\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}mR^2\\dot{\\theta}^2 + mgR(\\cos\\theta - \\sin\\theta)$$\n\nNow, we apply the conservation of energy, $E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}}$.\n\nThe initial state is the bead at rest at the highest point of the hoop.\n- Highest point: $\\theta_i = 0$.\n- At rest: $\\dot{\\theta}_i = 0$.\nThe initial kinetic energy is $T_i = 0$. The initial potential energy is:\n$$U_i = U(0) = mgR(\\cos(0) - \\sin(0)) = mgR(1 - 0) = mgR$$\nThe total initial energy is $E_{\\text{initial}} = T_i + U_i = mgR$.\n\nThe final state is when the bead first reaches the lowest point of the hoop.\n- Lowest point: $\\theta_f = \\pi$.\n- Let the angular velocity at this point be $\\dot{\\theta}_f$.\nThe final kinetic energy is $T_f = \\frac{1}{2}mR^2\\dot{\\theta}_f^2$. The final potential energy is:\n$$U_f = U(\\pi) = mgR(\\cos(\\pi) - \\sin(\\pi)) = mgR(-1 - 0) = -mgR$$\nThe total final energy is $E_{\\text{final}} = T_f + U_f = \\frac{1}{2}mR^2\\dot{\\theta}_f^2 - mgR$.\n\nBy the conservation of energy:\n$$E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}}$$\n$$mgR = \\frac{1}{2}mR^2\\dot{\\theta}_f^2 - mgR$$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\dot{\\theta}_f^2$:\n$$2mgR = \\frac{1}{2}mR^2\\dot{\\theta}_f^2$$\n$$4mgR = mR^2\\dot{\\theta}_f^2$$\n$$\\dot{\\theta}_f^2 = \\frac{4mgR}{mR^2} = \\frac{4g}{R}$$\n\nThe angular velocity is $\\dot{\\theta}_f = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{4g}{R}} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{R}}$.\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the angular velocity, which is:\n$$|\\dot{\\theta}_f| = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{R}}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{R}}}$$", "id": "2070783"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the overall shape of trajectories, the most telling features of a phase portrait are its equilibrium points.
