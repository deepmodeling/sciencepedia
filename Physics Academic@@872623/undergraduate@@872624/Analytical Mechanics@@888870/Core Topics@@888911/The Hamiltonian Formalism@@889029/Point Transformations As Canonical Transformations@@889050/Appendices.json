An inversion transformation $T_2: (Q', P') \\to (Q, P)$ where $Q = 1/Q'$.\n\nWe will first find the generating functions for each individual transformation and then use the composition rule for generating functions to find the generating function for the overall transformation. For point transformations of the form $Q = f(q)$, the Type-2 generating function $F_2(q, P)$ is particularly convenient. A Type-2 generating function $F_2(q, P)$ relates the old and new coordinates and momenta via the equations:\n$$p = \\frac{\\partial F_2(q, P)}{\\partial q}, \\quad Q = \\frac{\\partial F_2(q, P)}{\\partial P}$$\n\n**Step 1: Generating function for the scaling transformation $T_1$.**\nThe transformation is $Q' = \\lambda q$. This is a point transformation. The Type-2 generating function, which we denote as $F_2^{(1)}(q, P')$, must satisfy:\n$$p = \\frac{\\partial F_2^{(1)}(q, P')}{\\partial q}, \\quad Q' = \\frac{\\partial F_2^{(1)}(q, P')}{\\partial P'}$$\nWe can determine the form of $F_2^{(1)}$ by integrating the second equation with respect to $P'$:\n$$F_2^{(1)}(q, P') = \\int Q' dP' = \\int (\\lambda q) dP' = \\lambda q P' + g(q)$$\nwhere $g(q)$ is an arbitrary function of $q$. To determine $g(q)$, we use the first equation for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} (\\lambda q P' + g(q)) = \\lambda P' + \\frac{dg}{dq}$$\nFor a pure point transformation $Q'=\\lambda q$, the momentum transformation is given by $P' = p / (\\partial Q' / \\partial q) = p/\\lambda$. Thus, $p = \\lambda P'$.\nComparing this with our derived expression for $p$, we find $\\lambda P' = \\lambda P' + dg/dq$, which implies $dg/dq = 0$. So, $g(q)$ is a constant, which can be set to zero without loss of generality.\nTherefore, the generating function for the first transformation is:\n$$F_2^{(1)}(q, P') = \\lambda q P'$$\n\n**Step 2: Generating function for the inversion transformation $T_2$.**\nThe transformation is $Q = 1/Q'$.

Thus, $P' = -P/(Q')^2$.\nComparing this with our derived expression for $P'$, we get $-P/(Q')^2 = -P/(Q')^2 + dh/dQ'$, which implies $dh/dQ' = 0$. So, $h(Q')$ is a constant that we can set to zero.\nTherefore, the generating function for the second transformation is:\n$$F_2^{(2)}(Q', P) = \\frac{P}{Q'}$$\n\n**Step 3: Composition of the generating functions.**\nThe generating function for the composite transformation $T = T_2 \\circ T_1$ is given by the composition rule for Type-2 functions:\n$$F_2(q, P) = F_2^{(1)}(q, P') + F_2^{(2)}(Q', P) - P'Q'$$\nThe intermediate variables $(Q', P')$ in this expression must be eliminated.
