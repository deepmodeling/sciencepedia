This is the magnitude of the particle's angular momentum. The specific angular momentum, $h = l/m = r^2\\dot{\\theta}$, is also conserved. We can evaluate this constant using the initial conditions: $h = r_0^2 \\omega_0$.\n\nFrom the conservation of specific angular momentum, we can express $\\dot{\\theta}$ as $\\dot{\\theta} = h/r^2$. Substituting this into the radial equation of motion:\n$$m\\ddot{r} - mr\\left(\\frac{h}{r^2}\\right)^2 = 0 \\implies \\ddot{r} - \\frac{h^2}{r^3} = 0$$\nThis is the differential equation for the radial motion. To find the shape of the orbit, $r(\\theta)$, we change the independent variable from $t$ to $\\theta$. We use the substitution $u = 1/r$.

The general solution is:\n$$u(\\theta) = C \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_p)$$\nwhere $C$ and $\\theta_p$ are constants of integration. Substituting back $u=1/r$, the trajectory is:\n$$\\frac{1}{r(\\theta)} = C \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_p)$$\nThe distance of closest approach, $d$, is the minimum value of $r$. This occurs when the right-hand side is maximized, i.e., when $\\cos(\\theta-\\theta_p)=1$. At this point, $1/d = C$, so $d = 1/C$. Our goal is to find the constant $C$.\n\nTo find $C$, we use the initial conditions.
