This exercise explores the Barabasi-Albert model, a foundational framework explaining the emergence of scale-free networks.

This practice will guide you through a mean-field analysis to derive the characteristic power-law degree distribution, providing a quantitative link between a microscopic growth mechanism and a macroscopic structural invariant. [@problem_id:869960]", "problem": "The Barabasi-Albert model describes the emergence of scale-free networks through the mechanisms of growth and preferential attachment. Consider a network that starts with a small number of nodes $m_0$ and grows by adding one new node at each discrete time step. Each new node connects to $m$ existing nodes. The defining characteristic of the model is preferential attachment: the probability that a new node will connect to an existing node $i$ is proportional to the degree $k_i$ of that node.\n\nWe can analyze the properties of this network using a continuous mean-field approximation. In this framework, we treat time $t$ and the degree of a node $k$ as continuous variables. For large times $t \\gg m_0$, the total number of nodes is $N(t) \\approx t$ and the sum of the degrees of all nodes in the network is $\\sum_j k_j \\approx 2mt$.\n\nThe probability for a new node to attach to a given node $i$ with degree $k_i$ is $\\Pi(k_i) = k_i / \\sum_j k_j \\approx k_i / (2mt)$. Since each new node adds $m$ links, the degree of node $i$ is expected to increase at a rate given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dk_i}{dt} = m \\cdot \\Pi(k_i) = m \\frac{k_i}{2mt} = \\frac{k_i}{2t}\n$$\nAssume that a new node added at time $t_i$ starts with an initial degree $k_i(t_i) = m$.\n\nYour task is to determine the degree distribution exponent $\\gamma$ for this model. The degree distribution $P(k)$ gives the probability that a randomly selected node has degree $k$. For large $k$, this distribution follows a power law of the form $P(k) \\sim k^{-\\gamma}$. To find $\\gamma$, follow these steps:\n1.  Solve the differential equation for $k_i(t)$ with the given initial condition to find the degree of a node $i$ at time $tt_i$.\n2.  Assume that nodes are added at a constant rate, meaning the introduction times $t_i$ are uniformly distributed. Use this to find the cumulative probability distribution $P(K  k)$, which is the probability that a randomly chosen node has a degree greater than $k$.\n3.  From the cumulative distribution, derive the probability density function $P(k)$.\n4.  Determine the exponent $\\gamma$ from the asymptotic form of $P(k)$ for large $k$.", "solution": "1.
