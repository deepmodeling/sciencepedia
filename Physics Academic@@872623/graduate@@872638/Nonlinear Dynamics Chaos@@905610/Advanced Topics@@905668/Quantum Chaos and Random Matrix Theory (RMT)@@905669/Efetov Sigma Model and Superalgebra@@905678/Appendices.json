A fundamental object in this context is a supermatrix, which is a block matrix operating on a vector space that is a direct sum of an even (commuting) and an odd (anti-commuting) subspace, known as a superspace.\n\nConsider a general supermatrix $M$ from the Lie superalgebra $\\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$. Such a matrix can be represented as:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} a & \\alpha \\\\ \\beta & d \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $d$ are commuting variables (c-numbers), and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are anti-commuting Grassmann variables, satisfying $\\alpha^2 = \\beta^2 = 0$ and $\\alpha\\beta = -\\beta\\alpha$. All c-numbers commute with all Grassmann variables.\n\nThe supertrace of $M$ is defined as $\\text{STr}(M) = a - d$. A key identity in supermatrix theory is $\\text{Sdet}(\\exp(M)) = \\exp(\\text{STr}(M))$, where Sdet is the superdeterminant.\n\nTo verify this identity via explicit calculation, one can use the super-eigenvalue formalism. A right-eigenvalue $\\lambda_R$ and its corresponding right-eigenvector $v_R$ for a supermatrix $M$ are defined by the equation $M v_R = \\lambda_R v_R$. Similarly, a left-eigenvalue $\\lambda_L$ and its eigenvector $v_L$ are defined by $v_L M = \\lambda_L v_L$. Note that the set of right eigenvalues is not generally the same as the set of left eigenvalues.\n\nThe superdeterminant of $\\exp(M)$ can be computed using the super-eigenvalues of $M$.

This identity is a fundamental result in superanalysis, often called the Berezin-Leites formula, which follows from the definition $\\text{Sdet}(A) = \\exp(\\text{STr}(\\ln A))$. The problem asks for a verification through calculation.\n\n2. First, we compute the supertrace of $M$.

This means we need to show that $\\text{Sdet}(\\exp(M))$ evaluates to $e^{a-d}$. A general way to prove the identity is to use the property that the superdeterminant is a group homomorphism, $\\text{Sdet}(AB) = \\text{Sdet}(A)\\text{Sdet}(B)$, and the definition of the matrix exponential, $\\exp(M) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (I + M/n)^n$.\n\n4.
