This simplifies a continuous system into a discrete sequence of symbols, often revealing its underlying structure. An archetypal example is the dynamics on the invariant set of a Smale horseshoe, which can be shown to be equivalent to a shift map on a space of bi-infinite sequences of symbols.\n\nA simple one-dimensional analogue that exhibits similar chaotic properties is the ternary map $f: [0, 1] \\to [0, 1]$ defined by:\n$$\nf(x) = 3x \\pmod 1\n$$\nwhere $a \\pmod 1$ denotes the fractional part of $a$.

If the itinerary is periodic, express your answer in a compact form using an overline to denote the repeating block of symbols (e.g., the sequence $0121212\\dots$ is written as $0\\overline{12}$).", "solution": "The problem asks for the symbolic itinerary of the point $x_0 = 5/13$ under the map $f(x) = 3x \\pmod 1$, with respect to the partition $I_0 = [0, 1/3)$, $I_1 = [1/3, 2/3)$, and $I_2 = [2/3, 1]$. We can find the itinerary by either directly iterating the map or by using the base-3 expansion of the number.\n\n**Method 1: Direct Iteration**\n\nThe symbolic itinerary is the sequence $s_0s_1s_2\\dots$ where $s_k = j$ if $f^k(x_0) \\in I_j$.\n\nLet's compute the first few iterates of $x_0 = 5/13$.\n\n**Step 0:**\n$x_0 = 5/13$.\nTo find $s_0$, we determine which interval $x_0$ belongs to. We compare $x_0$ with the boundaries $1/3$ and $2/3$.\n$1/3 = 13/39$ and $2/3 = 26/39$.\n$x_0 = 5/13 = 15/39$.\nSince $13/39 \\le 15/39 < 26/39$, we have $x_0 \\in [1/3, 2/3) = I_1$.\nTherefore, $s_0 = 1$.\n\n**Step 1:**\n$x_1 = f(x_0) = f(5/13) = 3 \\times (5/13) \\pmod 1 = 15/13 \\pmod 1 = 2/13$.\nTo find $s_1$, we locate $x_1$.\n$x_1 = 2/13 = 6/39$.\nSince $0 \\le 6/39 < 13/39$, we have $x_1 \\in [0, 1/3) = I_0$.\nTherefore, $s_1 = 0$.\n\n**Step 2:**\n$x_2 = f(x_1) = f(2/13) = 3 \\times (2/13) \\pmod 1 = 6/13 \\pmod 1 = 6/13$.\nTo find $s_2$, we locate $x_2$.\n$x_2 = 6/13 = 18/39$.\nSince $13/39 \\le 18/39 < 26/39$, we have $x_2 \\in [1/3, 2/3) = I_1$.\nTherefore, $s_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 3:**\n$x_3 = f(x_2) = f(6/13) = 3 \\times (6/13) \\pmod 1 = 18/13 \\pmod 1 = 5/13$.\nWe observe that $x_3 = 5/13 = x_0$.\nSince the sequence of points has returned to the starting point, the orbit is periodic with period 3: $x_0 \\to x_1 \\to x_2 \\to x_0 \\to \\dots$.\nThe sequence of points is $(5/13, 2/13, 6/13, \\dots)$.\nThe sequence of symbols will also be periodic with period 3. We have already found the first three symbols: $s_0=1$, $s_1=0$, $s_2=1$. This block will repeat.\nThe full itinerary is $101101101\\dots$.\n\nIn compact notation, this is written as $\\overline{101}$.\n\n**Method 2: Base-3 Expansion**\n\nThe map $f(x) = 3x \\pmod 1$ is known as a shift map when viewed in terms of the base-3 expansion of $x$. Let the base-3 expansion of $x \\in [0,1]$ be\n$$\nx = (0.a_1a_2a_3\\dots)_3 = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_k}{3^k}\n$$\nwhere $a_k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. Applying the map $f$ gives:\n$$\nf(x) = \\left(3 \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_k}{3^k}\\right) \\pmod 1 = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_k}{3^{k-1}}\\right) \\pmod 1 = \\left(a_1 + \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_k}{3^{k-1}}\\right) \\pmod 1 = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_{j+1}}{3^j} = (0.a_2a_3a_4\\dots)_3\n$$\nThe map shifts the sequence of digits to the left and drops the first digit.\n\nThe partition $I_j$ corresponds to the value of the first digit $a_1$:\n- If $a_1=0$, then $x \\in [0, 1/3]$.\n- If $a_1=1$, then $x \\in [1/3, 2/3]$.\n- If $a_1=2$, then $x \\in [2/3, 1]$.\n(For boundary points like $1/3 = (0.100\\dots)_3 = (0.022\\dots)_3$, a convention is needed. The problem partition puts $1/3$ in $I_1$ and $2/3$ in $I_2$, which corresponds to choosing the expansion that does not end in an infinite tail of 2s, where possible).\n\nThe symbolic itinerary $s_k$ is simply the $(k+1)$-th digit of the base-3 expansion of $x_0$: $s_k = a_{k+1}$.\nSo, $S(x_0) = a_1a_2a_3\\dots$. We need to find the base-3 expansion of $x_0 = 5/13$. We can do this with the following algorithm:\nLet $r_0 = 5/13$.\n1.  $a_1 = \\lfloor 3r_0 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 3 \\times 5/13 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 15/13 \\rfloor = 1$.\n    $r_1 = 3r_0 - a_1 = 15/13 - 1 = 2/13$.\n2.  $a_2 = \\lfloor 3r_1 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 3 \\times 2/13 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 6/13 \\rfloor = 0$.\n    $r_2 = 3r_1 - a_2 = 6/13 - 0 = 6/13$.\n3.  $a_3 = \\lfloor 3r_2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 3 \\times 6/13 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 18/13 \\rfloor = 1$.\n    $r_3 = 3r_2 - a_3 = 18/13 - 1 = 5/13$.\n\nWe see that $r_3 = r_0$, so the process will repeat. The sequence of digits $a_k$ is periodic: $1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, \\dots$.\nTherefore, the base-3 expansion of $5/13$ is $(0.101101\\dots)_3 = (0.\\overline{101})_3$.\nThe symbolic itinerary is the sequence of these digits: $S(5/13) = 101101\\dots = \\overline{101}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\overline{101}} $$", "id": "903983"}, {"introduction": "Once we can encode dynamics into symbols, the power of this framework is revealed by reversing the process.
