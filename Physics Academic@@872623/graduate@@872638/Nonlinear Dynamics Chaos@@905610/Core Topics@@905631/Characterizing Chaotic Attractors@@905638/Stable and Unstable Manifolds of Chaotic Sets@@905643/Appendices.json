Consider a version of this map, $F$, acting on the unit square $S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$. The map is parameterized by a stretching factor $\\lambda  2$ and a contraction factor $\\mu \\in (0, 1/2)$.\n\nThe action of the map is defined in two stages. First, the square is contracted in the $y$-direction by $\\mu$ and stretched in the $x$-direction by $\\lambda$. The resulting rectangle is then folded and placed back over the original square domain. This process is described by defining the map on two disjoint vertical strips, $V_0$ and $V_1$, which constitute the domain of the map's inverse branch on $S$:\n-   $V_0 = [0, 1/\\lambda] \\times [0,1]$\n-   $V_1 = [1 - 1/\\lambda, 1] \\times [0,1]$\n\nThe map $F$ transforms these vertical strips into horizontal strips as follows:\n-   For a point $(x,y) \\in V_0$: $F(x,y) = (\\lambda x, \\mu y)$\n-   For a point $(x,y) \\in V_1$: $F(x,y) = (\\lambda(x-1)+1, \\mu y + (1-\\mu))$\n\nThe invariant set $\\Lambda$ of this map is the set of all points $p$ that remain within the domain $D=V_0 \\cup V_1$ under all forward and backward iterations of $F$.
