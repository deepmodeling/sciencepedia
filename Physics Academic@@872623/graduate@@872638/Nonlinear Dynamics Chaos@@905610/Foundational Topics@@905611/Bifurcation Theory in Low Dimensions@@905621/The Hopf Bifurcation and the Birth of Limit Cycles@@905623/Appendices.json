By converting the system to polar coordinates, we can clearly separate the evolution of the system's amplitude from its phase, making the analysis of the emergent limit cycle transparent. This practice is fundamental for understanding how to determine the critical conditions for bifurcation and to calculate key properties of the resulting oscillation, such as its frequency [@problem_id:898646].", "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional dynamical system described by the following coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{x} = (\\mu - K)x - \\omega y - (\\alpha x + \\beta y)\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\\\\n\\dot{y} = \\omega x + (\\mu - K)y + (\\beta x - \\alpha y)\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are the state variables.

Calculate the angular frequency $\\Omega$ of the motion on this limit cycle.\n\n**Step 1: Find the critical value $\\mu_c$**\n\nA Hopf bifurcation occurs when the real part of a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix, evaluated at a fixed point, crosses zero. The fixed point is given as the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nThe system is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{x} = f(x,y) = (\\mu - K)x - \\omega y - (\\alpha x + \\beta y)\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\\\\n\\dot{y} = g(x,y) = \\omega x + (\\mu - K)y + (\\beta x - \\alpha y)\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe Jacobian matrix $J$ has elements $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}$, where $(f_1, f_2) = (\\dot{x}, \\dot{y})$ and $(x_1, x_2) = (x, y)$.\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\dot{y}}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial \\dot{y}}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe nonlinear terms are proportional to $(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}$. For example, the term $\\alpha x \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ is $O(r^2)$. The derivatives of these terms with respect to $x$ or $y$ will be $O(r)$ and will thus vanish when evaluated at the origin $(r=0)$. We only need to consider the linear terms to evaluate the Jacobian at $(0,0)$.\n\nThe linear part of the system is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{x} \\\\ \\dot{y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu-K  -\\omega \\\\ \\omega  \\mu-K \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo the Jacobian matrix at the origin is:\n$$\nJ(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu-K  -\\omega \\\\ \\omega  \\mu-K \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are found from the characteristic equation $\\det(J(0,0) - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n(\\mu-K-\\lambda)^2 - (-\\omega)(\\omega) = 0 \\\\\n(\\mu-K-\\lambda)^2 = -\\omega^2 \\\\\n\\mu-K-\\lambda = \\pm i\\omega \\\\\n\\lambda = (\\mu-K) \\pm i\\omega\n$$\nA Hopf bifurcation occurs when the real part of the eigenvalues is zero:\n$$\n\\text{Re}(\\lambda) = \\mu-K = 0\n$$\nThis gives the critical value of the parameter $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu_c = K\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Convert to polar coordinates**\n\nWe use the standard relations $x=r\\cos\\theta$, $y=r\\sin\\theta$, which imply $r^2=x^2+y^2$. Differentiating $r^2$ with respect to time gives $2r\\dot{r} = 2x\\dot{x} + 2y\\dot{y}$, so $\\dot{r} = (x\\dot{x}+y\\dot{y})/r$.\n$$\nx\\dot{x} + y\\dot{y} = x[(\\mu-K)x - \\omega y - (\\alpha x + \\beta y)r] + y[\\omega x + (\\mu-K)y + (\\beta x - \\alpha y)r] \\\\\n= (\\mu-K)x^2 - \\omega xy - (\\alpha x^2 + \\beta xy)r + \\omega xy + (\\mu-K)y^2 + (\\beta xy - \\alpha y^2)r \\\\\n= (\\mu-K)(x^2+y^2) - (\\alpha x^2 + \\alpha y^2)r = (\\mu-K)r^2 - \\alpha(x^2+y^2)r = (\\mu-K)r^2 - \\alpha r^3\n$$\nThus, the radial equation is:\n$$\n\\dot{r} = \\frac{(\\mu-K)r^2 - \\alpha r^3}{r} = (\\mu-K)r - \\alpha r^2\n$$\nFor the angular velocity, we use $\\dot{\\theta} = (x\\dot{y}-y\\dot{x})/r^2$.\n$$\nx\\dot{y} - y\\dot{x} = x[\\omega x + (\\mu-K)y + (\\beta x - \\alpha y)r] - y[(\\mu-K)x - \\omega y - (\\alpha x + \\beta y)r] \\\\\n= \\omega x^2 + (\\mu-K)xy + (\\beta x^2 - \\alpha xy)r - (\\mu-K)xy + \\omega y^2 + (\\alpha xy + \\beta y^2)r \\\\\n= \\omega(x^2+y^2) + (\\beta x^2 + \\beta y^2)r = \\omega r^2 + \\beta r^3\n$$\nThus, the angular equation is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{\\omega r^2 + \\beta r^3}{r^2} = \\omega + \\beta r\n$$\nThe system in polar coordinates is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{r} = (\\mu-K)r - \\alpha r^2 \\\\\n\\dot{\\theta} = \\omega + \\beta r\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Find the limit cycle radius $R$**\n\nA limit cycle is a periodic orbit, which corresponds to a non-zero fixed point of the radial dynamics. We set $\\dot{r}=0$ to find the equilibrium radius $R$:\n$$\n(\\mu-K)R - \\alpha R^2 = 0 \\\\\nR((\\mu-K) - \\alpha R) = 0\n$$\nThis equation has two solutions: $R=0$ (the fixed point at the origin) and $R = (\\mu-K)/\\alpha$.\nFor a limit cycle to exist, its radius must be real and positive, so $R0$. Since $\\alpha0$, this requires $\\mu-K  0$, or $\\mu  K = \\mu_c$. This confirms the information given in the problem about a stable limit cycle for $\\mu  \\mu_c$.\n\nThe problem asks for the frequency at $\\mu=2\\mu_c=2K$.
