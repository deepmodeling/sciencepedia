In the tight-binding approximation, the energy dispersion relation is given by\n$$ E(k_x, k_y) = -2t (\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a)) $$\nwhere $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping integral, and $(k_x, k_y)$ are the components of the wave vector within the first Brillouin zone, defined by $-\\pi/a  k_x \\le \\pi/a$ and $-\\pi/a  k_y \\le \\pi/a$.\n\nThe de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect, the oscillation of magnetic susceptibility as a function of inverse magnetic field, is a powerful tool for probing the Fermi surface of metals.

We assume $t>0$. The Fermi surface is the contour of constant energy defined by $E(k_x, k_y) = E_F$.\n\nThe band has a minimum energy at the $\\Gamma$ point $(k_x, k_y) = (0,0)$, where $E_{min} = -2t(\\cos(0) + \\cos(0)) = -4t$.\nThe band has a maximum energy at the M point $(k_x, k_y) = (\\pi/a, \\pi/a)$, where $E_{max} = -2t(\\cos(\\pi) + \\cos(\\pi)) = 4t$.\n\nFor Fermi energies $E_F$ just above $E_{min}$, the Fermi surface consists of small, closed, roughly circular contours centered at the $\\Gamma$ point. These are closed electron orbits.\n\nThe transition to open orbits occurs when the Fermi surface first touches the boundary of the first Brillouin zone. The first Brillouin zone is a square defined by $|k_x| \\le \\pi/a$ and $|k_y| \\le \\pi/a$. The topology change occurs when the Fermi surface reaches the saddle points of the energy dispersion, which are located at the X and Y points of the Brillouin zone boundary: $(\\pm \\pi/a, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm \\pi/a)$.\n\nLet's find the energy at these saddle points. For example, at $(k_x, k_y) = (\\pi/a, 0)$:\n$$ E(\\pi/a, 0) = -2t (\\cos(\\pi a / a) + \\cos(0)) = -2t(-1 + 1) = 0 $$\nSo, the critical Fermi energy at which the transition occurs is $E_F^c = 0$.\n\nFor $E_F  0$, the Fermi surfaces are closed contours around the $\\Gamma$ point.\nFor $E_F  0$, the Fermi surfaces are closed contours around the M point (which can be viewed as hole pockets).\nAt $E_F = 0$, the Fermi surface is given by $\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a) = 0$. This surface connects the points $(\\pm\\pi/a, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm\\pi/a)$, forming a square grid rotated by $45^\\circ$ that extends throughout k-space in the repeated zone scheme. This is the onset of open orbits.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Critical Filling Fraction**\n\nNow we need to find the band filling fraction $\\nu_c$ that corresponds to the Fermi energy $E_F^c = 0$.\nThe band filling fraction $\\nu$ is the number of electrons per site, $N_e/N_{sites}$.\nThe total number of available k-states in the first Brillouin zone is equal to the number of lattice sites, $N_{sites}$. Including spin degeneracy, the total number of electron states is $2 N_{sites}$.\n\nThe number of electrons $N_e$ is given by the number of occupied states. Taking into account spin, this is twice the number of occupied k-states. The number of occupied k-states is $N_{sites}$ times the fraction of the Brillouin zone area that is occupied.\n$$ N_e = 2 \\times N_{sites} \\times \\frac{A_{occ}(E_F)}{A_{BZ}} $$\nwhere $A_{occ}(E_F)$ is the area in k-space where $E(\\vec{k}) \\le E_F$, and $A_{BZ} = (2\\pi/a)^2$ is the total area of the first Brillouin zone.\n\nThe filling fraction is therefore:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{N_e}{N_{sites}} = 2 \\frac{A_{occ}(E_F)}{A_{BZ}} $$\nWe need to calculate this for the critical Fermi energy $E_F^c = 0$.\n$$ \\nu_c = 2 \\frac{A_{occ}(E_F=0)}{A_{BZ}} $$\nThe occupied area $A_{occ}(E_F=0)$ is the area within the first Brillouin zone where $E(\\vec{k}) \\le 0$. Given $t>0$, this condition is:\n$$ -2t (\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a)) \\le 0 \\implies \\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a) \\ge 0 $$\nWe need to find the fractional area of the Brillouin zone satisfying this condition.\n\nWe can solve this by direct integration, but a more elegant method uses the particle-hole symmetry of the model. The energy spectrum exhibits the property $E(k_x + \\pi/a, k_y + \\pi/a) = -E(k_x, k_y)$:\n$$ E(k_x + \\pi/a, k_y + \\pi/a) = -2t (\\cos(k_x a + \\pi) + \\cos(k_y a + \\pi)) $$\n$$ = -2t (-\\cos(k_x a) - \\cos(k_y a)) = 2t (\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a)) = -E(k_x, k_y) $$\nThis means for every k-state with energy $E$, there is another k-state (shifted by the vector $\\vec{Q} = (\\pi/a, \\pi/a)$) with energy $-E$. This leads to a symmetric density of states (DOS), $D(E) = D(-E)$, over the band from $-4t$ to $4t$.\n\nThe total number of states in the band is proportional to $\\int_{-4t}^{4t} D(E) dE$.\nThe number of occupied states for $E_F=0$ is proportional to $\\int_{-4t}^{0} D(E) dE$.\n\nDue to the symmetry $D(E) = D(-E)$, we have:\n$$ \\int_{-4t}^{0} D(E) dE = \\int_{0}^{4t} D(-E) dE = \\int_{0}^{4t} D(E) dE $$\nTherefore,\n$$ \\int_{-4t}^{4t} D(E) dE = \\int_{-4t}^{0} D(E) dE + \\int_{0}^{4t} D(E) dE = 2 \\int_{-4t}^{0} D(E) dE $$\nThis implies that at $E_F=0$, exactly half of the available k-states in the band are filled.

It requires the implementation of a standard data analysis pipeline for extracting de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation frequencies from a simulated magnetization signal. The problem is scientifically grounded, formally specified, and objective. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. Therefore, I will provide a complete solution.\n\nThe core principle of the dHvA effect is that, in the presence of a strong magnetic field $B$, the quantization of electronic orbits into Landau levels leads to oscillations in thermodynamic properties, such as magnetization $M$. These oscillations are periodic not in the magnetic field $B$ itself, but in its inverse, $x = 1/B$. The frequency $F$ of these oscillations, expressed in units of tesla, is directly proportional to the extremal cross-sectional area of the Fermi surface perpendicular to the magnetic field. The objective is to extract these frequencies from a given signal $M(B)$.\n\nThe provided data is generated deterministically via the model:\n$$\nM_i = \\underbrace{c_0 + c_1 B_i + c_2 B_i^2}_{\\text{Background}} + \\underbrace{\\sum_{j=1}^{J} A_j B_i^{-1/2} \\sin\\!\\left(2\\pi \\frac{F_j}{B_i} + \\phi_j\\right)}_{\\text{dHvA Oscillations}} + \\underbrace{\\eta_1 \\sin\\!\\left(2\\pi \\frac{B_i}{\\tau_1}\\right) + \\eta_2 \\cos\\!\\left(2\\pi \\frac{B_i}{\\tau_2}\\right)}_{\\text{Pseudo-noise}}\n$$\nwhere the magnetic field samples $B_i$ are nearly, but not perfectly, uniform. The analysis pipeline must robustly handle the non-uniform sampling, background signal, and finite window effects to accurately determine the frequencies $F_j$. The following steps detail the methodology, with justifications for each critical stage of processing.\n\n**Step 1: Grid Transformation and Resampling**\n\nThe fundamental tool for frequency analysis is the Fourier Transform. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and its efficient implementation, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), requires the input signal to be sampled at uniform intervals of its independent variable. The physical nature of the dHvA effect dictates that the oscillatory part of the magnetization is periodic in $x=1/B$. Thus, the independent variable for Fourier analysis must be $x$.\n\nThe raw data is provided as pairs $(B_i, M_i)$, where $B_i$ samples are not uniformly spaced. Consequently, the samples in the inverse field, $x_i = 1/B_i$, are also non-uniform. To apply the FFT, we must first resample the magnetization data onto a uniform grid in the $x$ variable.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1. For each measurement $(B_i, M_i)$, compute the inverse field $x_i = 1/B_i$.\n2. Because the original $B_i$ values are sorted, the resulting $x_i$ values will be sorted in descending order. The data pairs $(x_i, M_i)$ are sorted by increasing $x_i$ to prepare for interpolation.\n3. A new uniform grid $\\{x_k\\}_{k=0}^{N_{\\mathrm{grid}}-1}$ is constructed, spanning the full range of the data, from $x_{\\min} = \\min(x_i)$ to $x_{\\max} = \\max(x_i)$. The number of points on this grid, $N_{\\mathrm{grid}}$, is chosen to be equal to the original number of data points, $N$. The grid spacing is uniform: $\\Delta x = (x_{\\max} - x_{\\min}) / (N_{\\mathrm{grid}}-1)$.\n4. The magnetization values $M(x_k)$ on this uniform grid are obtained by applying piecewise-linear interpolation to the sorted, non-uniform data $(x_i, M_i)$. This method is chosen for its stability and computational efficiency.\n\n**Step 2: Background Subtraction (Detrending)**\n\nThe magnetization signal $M(x)$ is a superposition of the desired high-frequency dHvA oscillations and a slowly varying background component. In the provided model, this background originates from the polynomial $c_0 + c_1 B + c_2 B^2$, which becomes a non-polynomial trend when viewed as a function of $x = 1/B$. This low-frequency trend, if not removed, will dominate the Fourier spectrum at and near zero frequency. The discontinuity between the start and end values of this trend, when treated as a periodic signal by the FFT, introduces significant spectral leakage that can obscure the weaker dHvA peaks.\n\nTo isolate the oscillatory component, this background trend must be subtracted. This process is called detrending. A common and effective method is to fit a low-degree polynomial to the signal $M(x_k)$ and subtract this fit from the data. The problem specifies fitting a polynomial of a degree $d=2$ in the variable $x$:\n$$\nP_2(x_k) = a_0 + a_1 x_k + a_2 x_k^2\n$$\nThe coefficients $(a_0, a_1, a_2)$ are determined by a least-squares fit to the interpolated data $M(x_k)$. The detrended signal is then computed as:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{detrend}}(x_k) = M(x_k) - P_2(x_k)\n$$\nThis procedure effectively removes the slowly varying component, leaving a signal that oscillates around zero, which is ideal for subsequent Fourier analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Apodization (Windowing)**\n\nAnalyzing a finite segment of data is mathematically equivalent to multiplying an infinite signal by a rectangular window function which is unity over the measurement interval $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$ and zero elsewhere. The sharp edges of this rectangular window in the $x$-domain cause a convolution with a $\\mathrm{sinc}$ function in the frequency domain. This results in each true spectral peak being broadened and accompanied by large side lobes, an effect known as spectral leakage. These side lobes can obscure nearby, weaker peaks or be mistaken for genuine frequencies.\n\nTo mitigate this, the detrended data is multiplied by an apodization (or window) function, $w(x_k)$, that smoothly tapers to zero at the boundaries of the interval. This reduces the sharpness of the signal's truncation, thereby suppressing the side lobes in the frequency spectrum at the cost of slightly broadening the main peak. For this problem, a Hann window is specified:\n$$\nw_k = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{N_{\\mathrm{grid}}-1}\\right)\\right) \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, \\dots, N_{\\mathrm{grid}}-1\n$$\nThe windowed signal is $M_{\\mathrm{windowed}}(x_k) = M_{\\mathrm{detrend}}(x_k) \\cdot w_k$.\n\n**Step 4: Fourier Transform and Peak Identification**\n\nAfter the preprocessing steps, the signal is prepared for Fourier analysis.\n1. A one-dimensional real-to-complex Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to the final signal, $M_{\\mathrm{windowed}}(x_k)$.\n2. The frequency axis corresponding to the FFT output is computed. The frequencies $f_k$ are given by $f_k = k / (N_{\\mathrm{grid}} \\Delta x)$, where $\\Delta x$ is the uniform sampling interval in the inverse field domain. The units of $f_k$ are tesla ($\\mathrm{T}$), as the units of $\\Delta x$ are $\\mathrm{T}^{-1}$.\n3. The magnitude of the complex FFT output is calculated to obtain the power spectrum.\n4. The dHvA frequencies correspond to the locations of distinct peaks in this magnitude spectrum. The peaks are identified by finding local maxima. The zero-frequency component (DC offset) is ignored, as it contains remnants of any imperfectly subtracted background. A low-frequency floor is also applied to avoid spurious peaks that may arise from artifacts of the detrending process.\n5. The identified peaks are ranked by their magnitude (prominence), and the top $K$ frequencies are selected as the result for each test case, as specified. These frequencies are then sorted in ascending order and rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nThis complete pipeline ensures a robust and physically meaningful extraction of the dHvA frequencies from the raw magnetization data.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.signal import find_peaks\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the dHvA analysis for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Deterministic constants for pseudo-noise\n    tau1 = 1.3\n    tau2 = 0.7\n    eta1 = 0.02\n    eta2 = 0.015\n\n    # Test suite definition\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"A\", \"B_min\": 7.0, \"B_max\": 15.0, \"N\": 601, \"epsilon\": 0.02,\n            \"J\": 1, \"F\": [530.0], \"A\": [1.2], \"phi\": [0.3],\n            \"c0\": 0.5, \"c1\": 0.1, \"c2\": 0.0, \"K\": 1\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"B\", \"B_min\": 8.0, \"B_max\": 20.0, \"N\": 801, \"epsilon\": 0.015,\n            \"J\": 2, \"F\": [380.0, 1050.0], \"A\": [1.0, 0.6], \"phi\": [-0.2, 1.0],\n            \"c0\": -0.3, \"c1\": 0.05, \"c2\": 0.002, \"K\": 2\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"C\", \"B_min\": 14.0, \"B_max\": 16.0, \"N\": 401, \"epsilon\": 0.005,\n            \"J\": 1, \"F\": [800.0], \"A\": [1.0], \"phi\": [0.5],\n            \"c0\": 0.1, \"c1\": 0.02, \"c2\": -0.0005, \"K\": 1\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"D\", \"B_min\": 5.0, \"B_max\": 10.0, \"N\": 501, \"epsilon\": 0.02,\n            \"J\": 1, \"F\": [600.0], \"A\": [0.6], \"phi\": [-1.0],\n            \"c0\": 1.0, \"c1\": 0.8, \"c2\": 0.0, \"K\": 1\n        },\n    ]\n\n    final_results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N = case[\"N\"]\n        B_min, B_max = case[\"B_min\"], case[\"B_max\"]\n        epsilon = case[\"epsilon\"]\n        \n        # --- 1.
