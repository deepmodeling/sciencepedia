Therefore, ratios of surface energies are given by ratios of $n_{s} b$.\n\nFirst compute the surface atomic densities. For the FCC lattice with lattice constant $a$:\n1) $(100)$: Consider the square of side $a$ on the $(100)$ face. It contains four corner atoms, each contributing one-fourth, and one face-centered atom contributing $1$, for a total of $2$ atoms per area $a^{2}$.

By carefully accounting for the valence electrons, you will deduce why this surface is stable with a simple buckling relaxation and does not need a periodicity-changing reconstruction, thereby gaining insight into the electronic origins of surface stability.", "problem": "In a covalent-ionic zincblende semiconductor such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), atoms are approximately $sp^3$ hybridized and form tetrahedral bonds in the bulk. Consider the unreconstructed cleavage surface GaAs(110), which is nonpolar and presents, in each primitive surface unit cell, one surface gallium (Ga) atom and one surface arsenic (As) atom, each with one surface dangling bond due to the truncation of the bulk coordination. Using only first principles of valence counting, bonding in tetrahedral semiconductors, basic electrostatics, and the Electron Counting Rule (ECR) as a widely used energetic criterion for surface stability in compound semiconductors, determine whether this GaAs(110) surface requires a reconstruction that changes the in-plane periodicity, and explain why or why not.\n\nSpecifically, reason from the following starting points without invoking any shortcut formulas: Ga has $3$ valence electrons and As has $5$ valence electrons; an ideal bulk covalent bond is formed by a pair of electrons shared between nearest neighbors; truncation at the surface leaves surface-localized dangling-bond orbitals on the outermost atoms; surfaces are energetically favored when no partially filled surface bands cross the Fermi level, consistent with the Electron Counting Rule (ECR), which states that stable compound semiconductor surfaces avoid partially filled dangling bonds by arranging the electron occupancy so that anion-derived dangling bonds are filled and cation-derived dangling bonds are empty.\n\nWhich option best captures, with correct electron counting and physical reasoning, why the GaAs(110) surface is experimentally observed to be stable in a $1\\times 1$ unreconstructed geometry (aside from small relaxations), rather than undergoing a periodicity-changing reconstruction?\n\nA. By electron counting, the surface Ga forms $3$ backbonds consuming its $3$ valence electrons, leaving its dangling bond empty, while the surface As forms $3$ backbonds using $3$ of its $5$ valence electrons and retains $2$ electrons in its dangling bond; thus, per $1\\times 1$ surface cell, the anion dangling bond is filled and the cation dangling bond is empty, satisfying the Electron Counting Rule and yielding a semiconducting surface without the need for reconstruction, aside from a small buckling relaxation that preserves $1\\times 1$ periodicity.\n\nB. Because each surface dangling bond on Ga and As is half-filled by symmetry, the unreconstructed GaAs(110) surface would be metallic; therefore, a $2\\times 1$ dimerization analogous to Si(100) is required to pair electrons and open a gap, implying the $1\\times 1$ surface is unstable.\n\nC. The nonpolar character of GaAs(110) eliminates all dangling bonds at the surface, so there is no need for either relaxation or reconstruction; the $1\\times 1$ periodicity is preserved because every surface atom remains fourfold coordinated.\n\nD. The octet requirement for surface As cannot be met on GaAs(110) unless half of the surface anions are removed in a $2\\times 2$ missing-row reconstruction to suppress As-derived surface states; hence, the unreconstructed $1\\times 1$ surface is unstable.\n\nE. GaAs(110) is unstable as an unreconstructed surface because it is polar and carries a macroscopic dipole normal to the surface; only by forming Ga–As heterodimers that double the periodicity can the dipole be canceled and the energy minimized.", "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for correctness and solvability.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Material System**: Gallium arsenide (GaAs), a covalent-ionic zincblende semiconductor.\n- **Bulk Properties**: Atoms are approximately $sp^3$ hybridized, forming tetrahedral bonds. Gallium (Ga) has $3$ valence electrons. Arsenic (As) has $5$ valence electrons. A bulk covalent bond consists of a pair of electrons.\n- **Surface**: The unreconstructed cleavage surface GaAs(110).\n- **Surface Unit Cell**: Contains one surface Ga atom and one surface As atom.\n- **Surface Properties**: The surface is nonpolar. Each surface atom has one dangling bond due to the truncation of the bulk, resulting from a reduction in coordination.\n- **Governing Principle**: The Electron Counting Rule (ECR) is provided as the criterion for energetic stability. It states that stable compound semiconductor surfaces avoid partially filled dangling bonds. Stability is achieved when anion-derived dangling bonds are filled and cation-derived dangling bonds are empty. This configuration results in no surface bands crossing the Fermi level, making the surface semiconducting.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded. The description of GaAs as a zincblende semiconductor, the valence electron counts for Ga ($3$) and As ($5$), the tetrahedral $sp^3$ bonding model, and the structure of the $(110)$ surface (nonpolar, one Ga and one As per primitive cell, three-fold coordination of surface atoms) are all standard and correct facts in solid-state physics. The Electron Counting Rule is a well-established and powerful heuristic model used to predict the stability and reconstruction of semiconductor surfaces. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information (atomic constituents, valence, surface geometry, and the ECR) to deduce a unique answer within the provided framework. There are no internal contradictions, unrealistic assumptions, or ambiguities. The problem is a classic example in surface science and is neither trivial nor unsolvable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe objective is to determine the stability of the unreconstructed GaAs$(110)$ surface using the given principles. The core of the analysis is electron counting for the surface atoms within the $1 \\times 1$ primitive unit cell.\n\n1.  **Identify Cation and Anion**: In GaAs, Ga is from Group $13$ and is the cation (less electronegative). As is from Group $15$ and is the anion (more electronegative).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Surface Structure**: The bulk zincblende structure has each atom tetrahedrally coordinated to $4$ neighbors of the other atomic species. Cleaving the crystal to expose the $(110)$ surface breaks exactly one bond for each atom in the top layer. Thus, each surface atom (both Ga and As) is bonded to $3$ other atoms (so-called \"backbonds\") and has one unsaturated, or \"dangling,\" bond orbital. The primitive surface unit cell contains one such Ga atom and one such As atom.\n\n3.  **Apply Electron Counting**: We must account for the distribution of all valence electrons contributed by the atoms in the surface unit cell.\n    -   The surface Ga atom contributes its $3$ valence electrons.\n    -   The surface As atom contributes its $5$ valence electrons.\n    -   The total number of valence electrons to be accounted for per $1 \\times 1$ unit cell is $3 + 5 = 8$.\n\n4.  **Distribute Electrons into Bonds and Dangling Orbitals**: A simple and effective model for electron counting in this context assumes that for each covalent backbond formed, the surface atom contributes one electron.\n    -   **Surface Ga (cation)**:\n        -   It forms $3$ backbonds.\n        -   To form these bonds, it contributes $1$ electron to each, for a total of $3$ electrons.\n        -   This uses all of its $3$ available valence electrons.\n        -   Consequently, the dangling bond orbital on the Ga atom is left with $3 - 3 = 0$ electrons. It is empty.\n    -   **Surface As (anion)**:\n        -   It also forms $3$ backbonds.\n        -   To form these bonds, it contributes $1$ electron to each, for a total of $3$ electrons.\n        -   It has $5$ valence electrons in total.\n        -   The remaining electrons, $5 - 3 = 2$, populate the dangling bond orbital on the As atom. The dangling bond is filled with a pair of electrons (a lone pair).\n\n5.  **Evaluate Stability using the Electron Counting Rule (ECR)**: The ECR states that a stable surface configuration is one where anion dangling bonds are filled and cation dangling bonds are empty.\n    -   Our analysis shows that for the ideal $1 \\times 1$ GaAs$(110)$ surface, the cation (Ga) dangling bond is naturally empty.\n    -   The anion (As) dangling bond is naturally filled.\n    -   This configuration perfectly satisfies the Electron Counting Rule.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on Reconstruction**: Since the ideal $1 \\times 1$ unreconstructed surface already fulfills the electronic stability criterion (ECR), there is no electronic driving force for a reconstruction that would change the surface periodicity (e.g., to $2 \\times 1$ or $2 \\times 2$). The surface is inherently semiconducting, with the filled As-derived dangling bond state forming a surface state below the valence band maximum and the empty Ga-derived dangling bond state forming a surface state above the conduction band minimum, leaving the fundamental band gap free of states. While the surface does not reconstruct, it does undergo a significant *relaxation* (atomic displacement without changing periodicity) to further lower its energy. The As atom, with its filled dangling bond, moves outward, and the Ga atom, with its empty dangling bond, moves inward, leading to a \"buckling\" of the surface Ga-As chains. This relaxation preserves the $1 \\times 1$ periodicity.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.** This option states that Ga uses its $3$ valence electrons for $3$ backbonds, leaving its dangling bond empty. It states that As uses $3$ of its $5$ valence electrons for $3$ backbonds, leaving its dangling bond filled with $2$ electrons. This leads to the conclusion that the ECR is satisfied, making the surface semiconducting and stable with a $1 \\times 1$ periodicity, aside from a buckling relaxation. This reasoning is a precise match to the derivation above.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B.** This option claims that each dangling bond is half-filled, which would make the surface metallic and require a reconstruction. This premise is incorrect. The different valencies of Ga ($3$) and As ($5$) lead to an asymmetric distribution of electrons into the dangling bonds (one empty, one full), not two half-filled bonds. This scenario of half-filled bonds is typical for elemental group IV semiconductors like Si, not for III-V compounds like GaAs.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C.** This option incorrectly claims that the nonpolar character eliminates dangling bonds and that surface atoms remain four-fold coordinated. Creating a surface inherently involves breaking bonds, which creates dangling bonds. Surface atoms by definition have a lower coordination than bulk atoms; on the $(110)$ surface, it is $3$, not $4$. The premises are factually wrong.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D.** This option claims the octet rule cannot be met for surface As and proposes a missing-row reconstruction. This is false. The surface As atom, with $3$ backbonds (involved in $6$ shared electrons) and a filled dangling bond ($2$ electrons), perfectly satisfies the octet rule. The premise is incorrect, and the proposed reconstruction mechanism is not what is observed for GaAs$(110)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E.** This option incorrectly claims that the GaAs$(110)$ surface is polar. The problem statement itself, and established knowledge, identifies the $(110)$ surface as nonpolar. Polar surfaces for zincblende are orientations like $(100)$ or $(111)$. Since the main premise of polarity is false, the entire argument collapses.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2864452"}]}
