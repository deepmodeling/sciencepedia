## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the fundamental principles distinguishing first and [zero sound](@entry_id:142772), we now turn our attention to the application of these concepts in diverse physical systems. The transition from a collision-dominated (hydrodynamic) regime to a collisionless one is not merely a theoretical curiosity; it is a fundamental process that governs the collective response of interacting [many-body systems](@entry_id:144006) across numerous fields. This chapter will explore how the [propagation of sound](@entry_id:194493)-like modes serves as a powerful experimental probe and a unifying theoretical concept, with applications ranging from the canonical quantum fluids of condensed matter to the exotic [states of matter](@entry_id:139436) found in neutron stars and even to theoretical models of [quantum gravity](@entry_id:145111).

### The Archetypal System: Liquid Helium-3

The most iconic illustration of the crossover from first to [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) is observed in liquid $^3$He at low temperatures. As a canonical Landau Fermi liquid, its quasiparticle [collision time](@entry_id:261390), $\tau$, exhibits a strong temperature dependence, scaling as $\tau \propto T^{-2}$. This provides an experimentally tunable parameter to explore both hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes. By propagating an ultrasound wave of fixed frequency $\omega$ through the liquid and lowering the temperature, one can systematically increase the product $\omega\tau$.

In the high-temperature regime ($\omega\tau \ll 1$), the system supports [first sound](@entry_id:144225), and the attenuation is dominated by viscosity, increasing as temperature falls (since viscosity is proportional to $\tau$). As the temperature is lowered further, the system enters the crossover regime, $\omega\tau \sim 1$. Here, the attenuation reaches a pronounced maximum because the system is neither fully hydrodynamic nor fully collisionless, leading to maximal dissipation. Upon further cooling into the collisionless regime ($\omega\tau \gg 1$), the attenuation begins to decrease, now being proportional to the collision rate, $1/\tau$. Concurrently, the sound velocity undergoes a significant change. It increases from the lower [first sound](@entry_id:144225) velocity, $c_1$, and saturates at a higher value, the [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) velocity, $c_0$. The experimental observation of a sound velocity at low temperatures that is substantially greater than the Fermi velocity ($c_0 > v_F$) is the definitive signature of [zero sound](@entry_id:142772). This measurement is not just a qualitative confirmation; the precise value of the ratio $s = c_0/v_F$ provides a direct experimental method for determining the crucial spin-symmetric Landau parameter $F_0^s$, which quantifies the strength of quasiparticle interactions [@problem_id:2999057].

The crossover condition $\omega\tau(T^*) \approx 1$ allows for a quantitative prediction of the temperature $T^*$ at which the attenuation peak occurs. Given the known Fermi-liquid scaling of the quasiparticle mean free path, $\ell(T) = \ell_0(T_0/T)^2$, and the relation $\tau(T) = \ell(T)/v_F$, one can derive the [crossover temperature](@entry_id:181193) as $T^* = T_0 \sqrt{\omega \ell_0 / v_F}$. For typical experimental parameters in liquid $^3$He (e.g., $f=1$ MHz), this crossover occurs in the millikelvin range, a temperature scale readily accessible in [low-temperature physics](@entry_id:146617) laboratories [@problem_id:3024854].

### A Menagerie of Sounds in Quantum Fluids

While $^3$He provides a clear example of first and [zero sound](@entry_id:142772), the broader family of [quantum fluids](@entry_id:140332), particularly [superfluids](@entry_id:180718), hosts a richer variety of sound-like collective modes. These are best understood within the two-fluid model, which describes the system as an interpenetrating mixture of a normal, viscous component (density $\rho_n$) and a superfluid, inviscid component (density $\rho_s$).

In superfluid $^4$He, [first sound](@entry_id:144225) persists as a pressure-density wave, but with both fluid components oscillating in phase. A distinct mode, **second sound**, also exists. This is not a pressure wave, but rather a temperature and entropy wave, where the two fluid components oscillate out of phase in such a way that the total mass density remains constant ($\rho_s\mathbf{v}_s + \rho_n\mathbf{v}_n = 0$). In a weakly interacting Bose gas at low temperatures, where the thermodynamics are dominated by [phonon excitations](@entry_id:159714), the velocity of second sound can be shown to be related to the [first sound](@entry_id:144225) velocity by the simple and elegant relation $c_2 = c_1/\sqrt{3}$ [@problem_id:267670].

Confining [superfluid helium](@entry_id:154105) to a "superleak"—a porous medium with channels so narrow that the viscous normal component is immobilized ($\mathbf{v}_n=0$)—gives rise to **[fourth sound](@entry_id:158255)**. In this configuration, only the inviscid superfluid component can oscillate, resulting in a pressure wave carried exclusively by the superfluid. The velocity of this mode is directly proportional to the superfluid fraction, given by $c_4 = c_1\sqrt{\rho_s/\rho}$, making its measurement a powerful tool for probing the [superfluid density](@entry_id:142018) [@problem_id:267712].

Even within the superfluid phases of $^3$He, which arise from Cooper pairing of the fermions, the concept of [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) remains relevant. In the anisotropic A-phase, for instance, the quasiparticle energy gap is not uniform over the Fermi surface. This intrinsic anisotropy of the superfluid state leads to a modification of the [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) velocity, making it dependent on the direction of propagation relative to the orbital anisotropy axis of the Cooper pairs. In the limit of strong interactions, this correction can be calculated and provides insight into the structure of the superfluid order parameter [@problem_id:267660].

### Sound Propagation in Electronic Systems

The [electron gas](@entry_id:140692) in metals and semiconductors provides another fertile ground for the application of these concepts, revealing how sound propagation is intimately coupled to the electronic properties of materials.

#### Sound in Metals: Screening and Phase Transitions

In a normal metal, the propagation of a conventional lattice vibration ([first sound](@entry_id:144225)) is influenced by the sea of mobile conduction electrons. In [piezoelectric materials](@entry_id:197563), the strain field of a sound wave generates an electric field, which in turn acts on the electrons. The electrons respond to screen this field, and this dynamic feedback renormalizes the sound velocity. The degree of screening depends on the sound wave's wavelength relative to the [electronic screening](@entry_id:146288) length (characterized by the Thomas-Fermi wavevector, $k_{TF}$). In the short-wavelength limit ($q \gg k_{TF}$), the electrons cannot respond effectively, and the sound velocity approaches an unscreened maximum value determined by the bare [electromechanical coupling](@entry_id:142536). Thus, the velocity of [first sound](@entry_id:144225) becomes [wavevector](@entry_id:178620)-dependent, a direct consequence of its interaction with the electronic medium [@problem_id:267610].

The velocity of sound is also a sensitive probe of electronic phase transitions. For example, in a quasi-[one-dimensional metal](@entry_id:136503) that undergoes a Peierls transition to a charge-density-wave (CDW) state, the formation of the electronic order parameter couples to the lattice. This coupling modifies the elastic properties of the material, leading to a measurable change in the bulk modulus and, consequently, the [first sound](@entry_id:144225) velocity. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis shows that this change is proportional to the square of the CDW order parameter, demonstrating how sound velocity measurements can be used to track the evolution of electronic order [@problem_id:267695].

#### Anisotropy and Modern Electronic Materials

Real materials often possess complex, non-spherical Fermi surfaces. This anisotropy has a direct effect on [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) propagation. In a Fermi liquid with an ellipsoidal Fermi surface, for example, the maximum quasiparticle velocity depends on direction. Consequently, the velocity of [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) becomes anisotropic, depending on the direction of propagation relative to the principal axes of the [effective mass tensor](@entry_id:147018). This highlights how [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) can be used to map out features of the underlying Fermi surface [@problem_id:267641].

In modern engineered materials, new phenomena emerge. In a bilayer system of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs), the interlayer coupling splits the [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) mode into two branches: a symmetric (in-phase) mode and an anti-symmetric (out-of-phase) mode, each with a distinct velocity determined by the combination of intra- and interlayer Landau parameters [@problem_id:267713]. In 2DEGs with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling, the distinction between charge and spin excitations blurs. The system no longer supports a pure charge sound wave ([zero sound](@entry_id:142772)) and a pure [spin wave](@entry_id:276228); instead, the [eigenmodes](@entry_id:174677) are coupled spin-charge waves. The velocities of these new modes are determined by an interplay between the original charge and spin mode velocities and the strength of the [spin-orbit coupling](@entry_id:143520) [@problem_id:267743].

Finally, the concept of [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) extends to some of the most exotic electronic systems known. In the fractional quantum Hall effect at a [filling factor](@entry_id:146022) of $\nu=1/2$, the system can be described as a liquid of [composite fermions](@entry_id:146885). These [emergent quasiparticles](@entry_id:144760) form their own Fermi sea and support collective excitations, including a [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) mode whose properties are governed by the effective interactions between [composite fermions](@entry_id:146885) [@problem_id:267634].

### Interdisciplinary Frontiers

The principles of first and [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) extend far beyond the traditional confines of condensed matter physics, appearing in [nuclear physics](@entry_id:136661), [plasma physics](@entry_id:139151), and even theoretical studies of quantum gravity.

#### Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics

The dense matter found inside atomic nuclei and [neutron stars](@entry_id:139683), composed of strongly interacting neutrons and protons, can be effectively described as a Fermi liquid. The Landau parameters for this nuclear Fermi liquid, such as $F_0^s$ and $F_1^s$, are crucial inputs for the [nuclear equation of state](@entry_id:159900), which in turn determines the structure and properties of neutron stars. Both [first sound](@entry_id:144225) (related to [compressibility](@entry_id:144559)) and [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) (a collisionless Fermi surface distortion) are relevant concepts. The ratio of their velocities, $c_0/c_1$, can be expressed directly in terms of the Landau parameters, providing a link between the microscopic interactions and the macroscopic collective response of nuclear matter [@problem_id:396890].

#### Plasma Physics and Magnetohydrodynamics

In a charged fluid, such as the [electron gas](@entry_id:140692) in a metal or an [astrophysical plasma](@entry_id:192924), collective density waves are coupled to [electromagnetic fields](@entry_id:272866). The propagation of a sound wave in a [magnetized plasma](@entry_id:201225) is described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). For a longitudinal wave propagating perpendicular to a strong magnetic field, the restoring force comes from both the fluid's intrinsic pressure and the magnetic pressure of the compressed field lines. The resulting mode, a fast magneto-sound wave, propagates at a speed determined by the quadrature sum of the hydrodynamic sound speed, $c_s$, and the Alfvén velocity, $v_A$, such that $c_{ms}^2 = c_s^2 + v_A^2$. This demonstrates a beautiful hybridization of mechanical and magnetic wave phenomena [@problem_id:267747].

#### Quantum Gravity and Holography

Remarkably, concepts analogous to [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) appear in theoretical models related to [quantum chaos](@entry_id:139638) and black holes. The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, a system of randomly interacting fermions, is a solvable model of a non-Fermi liquid that is maximally chaotic and shares features with black holes. A one-dimensional chain of coupled SYK dots, despite its chaotic nature, supports a coherent, propagating sound-like mode. This mode emerges from the collective dynamics of fluctuations in the local time coordinate and can be identified as a form of [zero sound](@entry_id:142772), whose velocity is set by the microscopic parameters of the model [@problem_id:267661].

Furthermore, the AdS/CFT correspondence, or holography, provides a powerful tool for studying strongly coupled [quantum fluids](@entry_id:140332) by mapping them to classical gravity in a higher-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. In this duality, the collective excitations of the fluid correspond to the [quasinormal modes](@entry_id:264538) (QNMs)—the characteristic "ringing" frequencies—of a black hole in AdS. The [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) mode of a strongly coupled, zero-temperature CFT at finite density is dual to the lowest-lying QNM of the corresponding extremal charged black hole. Calculating the properties of this QNM provides a first-principles prediction for the [zero sound](@entry_id:142772) velocity in a regime inaccessible to conventional perturbation theory [@problem_id:267730]. This profound connection establishes sound propagation, a concept rooted in classical mechanics, as a key player in the exploration of quantum gravity.
