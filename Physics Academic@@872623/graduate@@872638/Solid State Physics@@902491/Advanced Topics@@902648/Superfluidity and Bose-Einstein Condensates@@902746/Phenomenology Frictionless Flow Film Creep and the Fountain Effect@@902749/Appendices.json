This exercise provides a concrete application of the model by tasking you with calculating the power dissipated by an oscillating disk, a scenario inspired by the famous Andronikashvili experiment.

Its behavior can be described by the two-fluid model, which postulates that He-II is composed of two interpenetrating fluid components:\n1.  A superfluid component with density $\\rho_s$, which has zero viscosity and zero entropy.\n2.  A normal fluid component with density $\\rho_n$, which behaves like a classical viscous fluid with viscosity $\\eta_n$.\n\nThe total density is $\\rho = \\rho_s + \\rho_n$. An important consequence of this model is that when an object moves through He-II, it only experiences viscous drag from the normal fluid component, as the superfluid component flows around it without friction. This phenomenon is central to the Andronikashvili experiment, which was designed to measure the density of the normal fluid.\n\nConsider a thin circular disk of radius $R$ submerged in a large volume of He-II at a fixed temperature $T < T_\\lambda$. The disk is made to execute torsional oscillations about its central axis (perpendicular to its plane) with a time-dependent angular velocity given by $\\dot{\\theta}(t) = \\Omega_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$.\n\nFor this problem, make the following simplifying assumptions:\n- The viscous penetration depth of the normal fluid, defined as $\\delta = \\sqrt{2\\eta_n / (\\omega \\rho_n)}$, is much smaller than the disk radius, i.e., $\\delta \\ll R$. This allows you to neglect edge effects and treat the fluid motion at any radial distance $r$ from the center as being independent of the flow at other radii.\n- The disk is very thin, and the viscous drag from the fluid on both faces of the disk contributes to the total power dissipation.\n- The superfluid component remains completely at rest and does not interact with the disk.\n\nYour task is to calculate the time-averaged power, $\\langle P \\rangle$, required to sustain the oscillation of the disk against the viscous drag of the normal fluid component. Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of the disk radius $R$, the angular velocity amplitude $\\Omega_0$, the angular frequency $\\omega$, and the normal fluid properties $\\rho_n$ and $\\eta_n$.", "solution": "To calculate the time-averaged power dissipation $\\langle P \\rangle$ due to the viscous drag of the normal fluid on both faces of the oscillating disk, we consider the local power dissipation per unit area and integrate over the disk's surface.
