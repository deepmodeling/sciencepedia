Consider imaging a sample that contains a rectangular trench: the top surface is planar, the trench has vertical sidewalls separated by a width $w$ (measured at the top plane) and a flat bottom at depth $d$ below the top surface. The measured AFM topography at lateral position $x$ is the height of the lowest tip apex position $z(x)$ such that the spherical tip just makes contact with the sample without interpenetration. Assume purely repulsive, non-adhesive contact and that the conical shank does not interfere before the spherical apex does.

Modeling the apex as a sphere of radius $R$, the envelope construction is the same as a morphological dilation of the sample by the tip shape. For a rectangular trench with vertical walls and a flat bottom, the limiting descent of the spherical apex at the trench center occurs when the sphere simultaneously touches both upper edges; beyond that point, any further descent would interpenetrate the sidewalls.\n\nTo derive the tip-limited maximum descent at the trench center, place the top surface at $z = 0$ and the trench center at $x = 0$. The vertical walls lie at $x = \\pm w/2$, extending down from $z = 0$. Let the sphere center be at $(x,z) = (0, z_{c})$ and its apex (lowest point) at $z_{\\mathrm{apex}} = z_{c} - R$. The sphere just touching the two top edges at $(x,z) = (\\pm w/2, 0)$ implies that these edge points lie on the spherical surface. Therefore the condition for simultaneous contact is\n$$(w/2)^{2} + (0 - z_{c})^{2} = R^{2},$$\nso that\n$$z_{c} = \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}}.$$\nThe corresponding apex height relative to the top surface is\n$$z_{\\mathrm{apex}} = z_{c} - R = -\\left(R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}}\\right).$$\nThus, the maximum descent of the apex below the top plane without interpenetration is\n$$\\Delta z_{\\max}(w,R) = R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}},$$\nprovided $w \\le 2 R$ so that the square root is real.

One obtains\n$$R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}} = R \\left[1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{w}{2R}\\right)^{2}}\\right] \\approx R \\left[1 - \\left(1 - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\tfrac{w}{2R}\\right)^{2}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{w^{2}}{8 R}.$$\nConsequently, when $d \\gg w^{2}/(8 R)$ the apparent depth is $d_{\\mathrm{AFM}}^{\\max} \\approx w^{2}/(8 R)$, independent of $d$.\n\nThe condition for the apex to reach the trench bottom is that, when the apex is at the bottom ($z_{\\mathrm{apex}} = -d$, i.e., $z_{c} = R - d$), the sphere does not intersect the sidewalls at the top edges. Non-intersection at $(\\pm w/2, 0)$ requires these edge points to be outside or on the sphere:\n$$(w/2)^{2} + (0 - z_{c})^{2} \\ge R^{2}.$$\nSubstituting $z_{c} = R - d$ yields\n$$(w/2)^{2} + (R - d)^{2} \\ge R^{2} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; (w/2)^{2} \\ge 2 R d - d^{2}.$$\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for the apex to reach the bottom is\n$$w \\ge 2 \\sqrt{2 R d - d^{2}}, \\quad \\text{for } d \\le 2 R.$$\nIf this inequality is violated, the apex cannot reach the bottom; the measured depth is tip-limited by the geometric constraint derived above.\n\nTurning to Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), the constant-current topography $z(x)$ is defined implicitly by the condition that the integrated tunneling current between the tip and the sample equals the setpoint. In the simplest local approximation, the tunneling current from any local point separated by a gap $z$ obeys $I \\propto \\exp(-2 \\kappa z)$ with $\\kappa = \\sqrt{2 m \\phi}/\\hbar$. Crucially, this dependence is not strictly local in lateral extent: nearby regions at similar $z$ contribute comparably if they are within a lateral distance where the vacuum gap to the tip is not much larger. Over a trench with vertical sidewalls, even an atomically sharp apex ($R \\to 0$) at the trench center receives significant current from the sidewalls because their shortest separation to the apex is only slightly larger than the vertical gap; as the tip descends, the sidewall contributions increase rapidly due to the exponential law, causing the feedback to retract the tip to maintain the setpoint. Hence, the apparent trench depth is reduced below the true $d$ for sufficiently narrow $w$. This broadening mechanism is intrinsically electronic (set by $\\kappa$) and persists even for $R \\to 0$, distinguishing it from purely geometrical dilation.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\nA. This is exactly the geometrical non-penetration result derived above. The maximum apparent depth at the center is limited by simultaneous contact with both edges, giving $d_{\\mathrm{AFM}}^{\\max}(w,R,d) = \\min\\!\\left(d,\\, R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}}\\right)$ for $w \\le 2 R$, and reduces to $d$ when $w  2 R$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Using the small-argument expansion for $w \\ll R$, we found $d_{\\mathrm{AFM}}^{\\max} \\approx w^{2}/(8 R)$ provided the true depth $d$ exceeds this tip-limited value. This is independent of $d$ in that regime. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. We derived the reach-bottom criterion $w \\ge 2 \\sqrt{2 R d - d^{2}}$ (for $d \\le 2 R$). Failure of this inequality implies the apex cannot reach the bottom and the measured depth is limited by the tip geometry. Verdict: Correct.\n\nD. The statement assumes perfect locality of tunneling, which contradicts the exponential distance dependence that gives finite lateral collection of current. Even for $R \\to 0$, nearby sidewalls contribute because their separation is only slightly larger than the vertical gap, so the apparent depth is not guaranteed to equal $d$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. This option correctly identifies that the finite decay length $1/(2 \\kappa)$ causes lateral averaging of the tunneling current and reduces the apparent depth in narrow trenches even for an atomically sharp tip. This is an electronic convolution distinct from pure geometric dilation. Verdict: Correct.\n\nF. Tapping (amplitude-modulation) AFM reduces shear and adhesion but does not remove the geometric constraint set by the finite apex radius; intermittent contact cannot make the apex narrower. Tip convolution remains, so apparent widths and depths depend on $R$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nG.
