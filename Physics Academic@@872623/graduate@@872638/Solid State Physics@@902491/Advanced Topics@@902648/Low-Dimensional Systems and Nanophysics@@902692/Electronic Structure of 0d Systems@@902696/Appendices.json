For this potential, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be solved exactly. The bound state energy eigenvalues $E_n$ are given by the formula:\n$$\nE_n = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}(s-n)^2\n$$\nwhere $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the principal quantum number. The dimensionless parameter $s$ is determined by the potential parameters via the relation:\n$$\ns = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{8mV_0a^2}{\\hbar^2}} - 1\\right)\n$$\nThe number of bound states is finite and is determined by the condition $n < s$.\n\nThe potential parameters $V_0$ and $a$ are specifically chosen such that the parameter $s$ is an integer, denoted by $K$, with $K \\ge 2$. An electron in this potential is excited from its ground state. It then undergoes a transition to a lower energy bound state by emitting a single photon.\n\nYour task is to derive an expression for the maximum possible wavelength, $\\lambda_{max}$, of a photon that can be emitted during a transition between any two distinct bound states of the system. Express your answer in terms of the electron mass $m$, the width parameter $a$, the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$, and the speed of light $c$.", "solution": "To find the maximum possible wavelength $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$ of an emitted photon, we first need to determine the energy of the transition, $\\Delta E$. The relationship between wavelength and energy is $\\lambda = hc/\\Delta E$. Therefore, maximizing the wavelength requires finding the minimum possible non-zero energy difference, $\\Delta E_{\\text{min}}$, between any two distinct bound states.\n\n**1. Analyze the Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues are given by $E_n = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}(s - n)^2$.\nWe are given that $s=K$, where $K$ is an integer and $K \\ge 2$. The allowed quantum numbers for bound states are $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, K-1$.\n\nTo simplify the analysis, let's define a new integer index $p = K - n$. As the quantum number $n$ ranges from $0$ to $K-1$, the index $p$ takes integer values from $K$ down to $1$. The energy levels can be expressed more simply in terms of $p$:\n$$\nE_p = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}p^2, \\quad \\text{for } p = 1, 2, \\dots, K\n$$\nHere, $E_1$ (corresponding to $n=K-1$) is the highest energy level (least negative), and $E_K$ (corresponding to $n=0$) is the ground state (most negative).\n\n**2. Find the Minimum Transition Energy**\n\nAn emission of a photon corresponds to a transition from a higher energy state (smaller $p$) to a lower energy state (larger $p$). Let the transition be from state $p_{\\text{initial}}$ to $p_{\\text{final}}$, where $p_{\\text{final}} > p_{\\text{initial}}$. The energy of the emitted photon is:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{p_{\\text{initial}}} - E_{p_{\\text{final}}} = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}p_{\\text{initial}}^2\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}p_{\\text{final}}^2\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}(p_{\\text{final}}^2 - p_{\\text{initial}}^2)\n$$\nTo find $\\Delta E_{\\text{min}}$, we must find the minimum value of $(p_{\\text{final}}^2 - p_{\\text{initial}}^2)$ for any two distinct states, i.e., $p_{\\text{final}} > p_{\\text{initial}}$, with $p \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, K\\}$. The difference between squares of integers is minimized when the integers are consecutive. So, we set $p_{\\text{final}} = p_{\\text{initial}} + 1$. The difference is then:\n$$\n(p_{\\text{initial}}+1)^2 - p_{\\text{initial}}^2 = 2p_{\\text{initial}} + 1\n$$\nThis difference is smallest for the smallest possible value of $p_{\\text{initial}}$. Since the states are labeled starting from $p=1$, the smallest possible initial state is $p_{\\text{initial}} = 1$. This corresponds to the transition from $p=1$ to $p=2$.\nThe minimum energy difference is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}(2^2 - 1^2) = \\frac{3\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}\n$$\n\n**3. Calculate the Maximum Wavelength**\n\nNow we can calculate the maximum wavelength using $\\Delta E_{\\text{min}}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{hc}{\\Delta E_{\\text{min}}} = \\frac{hc}{\\frac{3\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}} = \\frac{2ma^2hc}{3\\hbar^2}\n$$\nTo express this in terms of $\\hbar$ instead of $h$, we use the relation $h = 2\\pi\\hbar$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{2ma^2(2\\pi\\hbar)c}{3\\hbar^2} = \\frac{4\\pi m c a^2}{3\\hbar}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the maximum possible wavelength of an emitted photon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\dfrac{4\\pi m c a^{2}}{3\\hbar}}$$", "id": "90628"}, {"introduction": "Real-world quantum dots, such as cubical nanocrystals, often possess high degrees of symmetry, leading to degenerate energy levels.
