The physical basis of AES is the Auger effect, a three-electron process that occurs after the creation of a core-level electron vacancy.\n\nConsider a KLL Auger process in an atom within a solid:\n1.  An incident high-energy particle (e.g., an electron) ionizes the atom by ejecting an electron from the K-shell (principal quantum number n=1), creating a core hole.\n2.  An electron from a higher energy level, the L-shell (n=2), transitions downward to fill the K-shell vacancy.\n3.  The energy released by this de-excitation is non-radiatively transferred to another electron, also in the L-shell, which is then ejected from the atom. This ejected electron is the KLL Auger electron.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the Auger electron is determined by the binding energies of the electronic levels involved. Let $E_{B,K}$ be the binding energy of the K-shell and $E_{B,L}$ be the binding energy of the L-shell, both measured with respect to a common reference level for a neutral atom.\n\nThe final state of the atom after the Auger process is a doubly-ionized state with two holes in the L-shell. The energy of this final atomic state, $E_{LL}$, is not simply twice the L-shell binding energy. The presence of the first hole in the L-shell makes the second L-shell electron more tightly bound due to reduced electron-electron screening. This effect can be quantified by a positive definite hole-hole repulsion energy, $U_{LL}$. The energy required to remove the second L-electron from the already singly-ionized atom is thus greater than $E_{B,L}$ by this amount, i.e., it is $(E_{B,L} + U_{LL})$.\n\nBased on the principle of energy conservation, derive a closed-form expression for the kinetic energy, $E_{kin}$, of the emitted KLL Auger electron. Express your answer in terms of $E_{B,K}$, $E_{B,L}$, and $U_{LL}$. For simplicity, neglect the work function of the material and other many-body relaxation effects.", "solution": "We derive the kinetic energy of the KLL Auger electron using energy conservation. The initial state is a neutral atom. The process involves three steps:\n\n1. An incident particle ejects a K-shell electron, creating a core hole. The energy required for this ionization is the binding energy of the K-shell, $E_{B,K}$, measured with respect to the neutral atom.\n\n2. An L-shell electron transitions to the K-shell, filling the vacancy. The energy released by this transition is the difference between the binding energy of the K-shell and the L-shell in the singly ionized state with a K-hole. However, the binding energy of the L-shell in the presence of the K-hole is not given explicitly. Instead, we consider the energy levels of the atomic states.\n\n3. The released energy ejects another L-shell electron, resulting in a final doubly ionized state with two holes in the L-shell.\n\nThe final state has two L-shell holes. The energy of this state, relative to the neutral atom, is the sum of the energies required to remove two L-shell electrons. Due to reduced screening, the energy to remove the first L-electron is $E_{B,L}$, and the energy to remove the second L-electron from the singly ionized atom (with one L-hole) is $E_{B,L} + U_{LL}$. Thus, the total energy of the final state is:\n\n$$\nE_{\\text{final}} = E_{B,L} + (E_{B,L} + U_{LL}) = 2E_{B,L} + U_{LL}\n$$\n\n\nBy conservation of energy, the energy supplied to create the initial K-hole equals the energy stored in the final ionized state plus the kinetic energy of the Auger electron:\n\n$$\nE_{B,K} = E_{\\text{final}} + E_{\\text{kin}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $E_{\\text{final}}$:\n\n$$\nE_{B,K} = 2E_{B,L} + U_{LL} + E_{\\text{kin}}\n$$\n\nSolving for $E_{\\text{kin}}$:\n\n$$\nE_{\\text{kin}} = E_{B,K} - 2E_{B,L} - U_{LL}\n$$\n\n\nAlternatively, consider the energy released when the L-shell electron transitions to the K-shell. This energy is the difference between the binding energy of the K-shell and the L-shell in the singly ionized state with a K-hole. The state with a K-hole has energy $E_{B,K}$ relative to the neutral atom, and the state with an L-hole has energy $E_{B,L}$ relative to the neutral atom. The energy released is:\n\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{B,K} - E_{B,L}\n$$\n\nThis energy is used to eject the second L-electron.
