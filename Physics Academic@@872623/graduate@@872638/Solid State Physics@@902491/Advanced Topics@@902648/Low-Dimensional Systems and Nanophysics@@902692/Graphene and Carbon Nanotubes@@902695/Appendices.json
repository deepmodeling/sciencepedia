Within the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model, a vacancy is known to introduce a quasi-localized state at the Fermi energy ($E=0$).

Introducing a vacancy on sublattice A removes one site from the lattice, altering the connectivity.

Each A site connects only to B sites and vice versa. Removing an A-site vacancy breaks the symmetry, leaving its three neighboring B sites with reduced coordination (each loses one connection to the removed A site).\n\nFor the zero-energy state:\n- **At B sites adjacent to the vacancy**: Each has two remaining A neighbors.
