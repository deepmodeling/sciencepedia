The ground state consists of a stack of flat, parallel layers. Deformations away from this state incur an elastic energy cost.

In a simplified model, the layers of a toroidal FCD are arranged as a family of concentric tori. A particular torus is defined by its major radius $R$ (the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) and its minor radius $\\rho'$ (the radius of the tube). The FCD fills a toroidal volume with a maximum minor radius $r$. The director field $\\mathbf{n}$ is everywhere normal to these toroidal layers.\n\nThis geometry implies the presence of a singular core, a disclination line of strength $+1$, which is a circle of radius $R$ at the center of the toroidal tube (i.e., at $\\rho'=0$). The elastic energy stored in the domain diverges as one approaches this singular core. The total energy per unit length of the core disclination, integrated from a small cutoff core radius $\\rho_c$ up to the domain boundary $r$, has the form:\n$$ \\frac{E}{L} = A \\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{\\rho_c}\\right) + B $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants for $\\rho_c \\ll r, R$.

Relevant Equations**\n\nThe splay free energy density is given by:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{2} K (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{n})^2,\n$$\nwhere $ K $ is the splay elastic constant and $ \\mathbf{n} $ is the unit director normal to the layers.\n\nFor a toroidal geometry with major radius $ R $ and minor radius $ \\rho' $, the layers are concentric tori.

This allows us to treat the problem as a straight disclination line with radial symmetry in the cross-sectional plane perpendicular to the core.\n\nIn this approximation, the director field $ \\mathbf{n} $ is radial in the cross-section, i.e., $ \\mathbf{n} = \\hat{\\rho}' $, where $ \\rho' $ is the minor radius.
