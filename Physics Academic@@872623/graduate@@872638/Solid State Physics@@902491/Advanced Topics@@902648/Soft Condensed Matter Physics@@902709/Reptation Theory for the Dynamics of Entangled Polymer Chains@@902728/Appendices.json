In this framework, a chain is confined to a \"tube\" formed by the topological constraints imposed by its neighbors.

[@problem_id:200038]", "problem": "**Background:** In the de Gennes-Doi-Edwards reptation model, a long, flexible polymer chain in a dense melt is envisaged as being confined to a \"tube\" formed by the topological constraints imposed by its neighbors. The chain's center-of-mass motion is severely restricted in directions perpendicular to the tube axis but is relatively free along the tube's curvilinear contour. This snake-like motion is diffusive and is characterized by a curvilinear diffusion constant, $D_c$. The terminal relaxation time, known as the reptation time $\\tau_d$, is the time it takes for the chain to fully escape its original tube.\n\n**Problem Setup:** We modify this picture by considering a polymer chain decorated with $n_s$ special monomer units, or \"stickers,\" distributed along its backbone. Each sticker can form a reversible, physical bond (a temporary crosslink) with the surrounding polymer matrix. At any given moment in thermal equilibrium, any single sticker is in a \"bound\" state with probability $p$ and in an \"unbound\" state with probability $1-p$. The states of the different stickers are statistically independent.\n\n**Dynamical Model:** The reptation dynamics of the chain are coupled to the state of the stickers. We adopt a simplified model where the chain's curvilinear motion is completely arrested if *at least one* of its stickers is bound. The chain is only mobile and diffuses along its tube with its intrinsic diffusion constant $D_c$ when *all* $n_s$ stickers are simultaneously in the unbound state. Assume that the sticker binding/unbinding kinetics are much faster than the overall chain relaxation. This allows for an effective medium approximation, where the effective curvilinear diffusion constant, $D_{eff}$, is given by the intrinsic constant $D_c$ multiplied by the equilibrium probability that the chain is mobile.\n\n**Task:** Using this model, derive the effective reptation time, $\\tau_{eff}$, for the stickered polymer chain. Express your answer in terms of the reptation time of an identical chain without stickers, $\\tau_d$, the number of stickers, $n_s$, and the probability of a single sticker being bound, $p$.", "solution": "The chain can only diffuse along the tube when all stickers are unbound.
