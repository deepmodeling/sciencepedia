The `ABC` notation specifies the lateral position of each layer. A more compact method is the Zhdanov notation, which describes the sequence of turning directions in the stacking. A cyclic turn (e.g., from A to B, B to C, or C to A) is denoted by `+`, while an anti-cyclic turn (e.g., from A to C, C to B, or B to A) is denoted by `-`. The Zhdanov symbol `(n_1 n_2 n_3 ...)` represents a sequence of $n_1$ consecutive turns of one type, followed by $n_2$ of the opposite type, then $n_3$ of the first type, and so on. The entire sequence inside the parentheses represents one period of the stacking sequence.\n\nConsider a hypothetical polytype described by the Zhdanov symbol `(41)_3`.

The arrangement of layers can be described by specifying the lateral position of each layer, denoted as A, B, or C.\n\nA simplified model for describing these structures uses stacking vectors. A \"cyclic\" or \"positive\" stacking step shifts layers in the sequence A→B, B→C, or C→A, and can be represented by a single vector $\\mathbf{s}_{+}$. An \"anticyclic\" or \"negative\" step corresponds to the sequence A→C, C→B, or B→A, represented by the vector $\\mathbf{s}_{-}$, where $\\mathbf{s}_{-} = -\\mathbf{s}_{+}$. The sequence of these stacking vectors completely defines a polytype. For instance, the common 3C (cubic) polytype corresponds to a purely cyclic sequence (e.g., ...ABCABC...) with all stacking vectors being $\\mathbf{s}_{+}$, while the 2H (hexagonal) polytype corresponds to an alternating sequence (e.g., ...ABABAB...) with stacking vectors alternating between $\\mathbf{s}_{+}$ and $\\mathbf{s}_{-}$.\n\nThe local character of the stacking around a given layer can be described by the Jagodzinski notation. A layer is said to have 'h' (hexagonal) character if its two adjacent layers are in the same relative position, for instance, in a B-A-B sequence, the central A layer is 'h-like'. A layer has 'c' (cubic) character if its neighbors are in different positions, as in C-A-B, where A is 'c-like'. In terms of stacking vectors, a layer $i$ has 'h' character if the vector from layer $i-1$ to $i$ ($\\mathbf{s}_{i-1}$) is the negative of the vector from layer $i$ to $i+1$ ($\\mathbf{s}_{i}$), i.e., $\\mathbf{s}_{i-1} = -\\mathbf{s}_{i}$.\n\nConsider a crystal exhibiting random stacking faults.
