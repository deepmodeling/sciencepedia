Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with its solution.\n\nThe analysis is structured into three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Equations of Motion and the Eigenvalue Problem\n\nWe consider a one-dimensional chain of $N$ identical atoms, each of mass $m$. The atoms are indexed by $n=1, 2, \\dots, N$. They are connected by massless springs of spring constant $K$ to their nearest neighbors. The chain is terminated by fixed supports at positions $n=0$ and $n=N+1$. Let $u_{n}(t)$ be the longitudinal displacement of the $n$-th atom from its equilibrium position. The fixed boundary conditions are given as $u_{0}(t) = 0$ and $u_{N+1}(t) = 0$ for all time $t$.\n\nWe apply Newton's second law to an arbitrary interior atom $n$, where $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. The net force on atom $n$ is the sum of the forces from the springs connecting it to atoms $n-1$ and $n+1$. Using Hooke's law for small displacements, the force exerted by atom $n+1$ on atom $n$ is $F_{n+1 \\rightarrow n} = K(u_{n+1} - u_{n})$. The force exerted by atom $n-1$ on atom $n$ is $F_{n-1 \\rightarrow n} = K(u_{n-1} - u_{n})$.\n\nThe equation of motion for the $n$-th atom is therefore:\n$$\nm \\frac{d^2 u_{n}}{dt^2} = F_{n+1 \\rightarrow n} + F_{n-1 \\rightarrow n} = K(u_{n+1} - u_{n}) + K(u_{n-1} - u_{n})\n$$\n$$\nm \\ddot{u}_{n} = K(u_{n+1} + u_{n-1} - 2u_{n})\n$$\nThis set of $N$ coupled differential equations describes the dynamics of the interior atoms.\n\nFor a normal mode, all atoms oscillate with the same angular frequency $\\omega$. We seek solutions of the form $u_{n}(t) = A_{n} \\exp(-i\\omega t)$, where $A_{n}$ is the time-independent amplitude of atom $n$. Substituting this ansatz into the equation of motion, we find the second time derivative to be $\\ddot{u}_{n} = -\\omega^2 A_{n} \\exp(-i\\omega t)$. This yields:\n$$\n-m\\omega^2 A_{n} \\exp(-i\\omega t) = K(A_{n+1} + A_{n-1} - 2A_{n}) \\exp(-i\\omega t)\n$$\nDividing by $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$ and rearranging gives the time-independent equations for the amplitudes $A_{n}$:\n$$\nm\\omega^2 A_{n} = K(2A_{n} - A_{n-1} - A_{n+1})\n$$\nThese equations hold for $n=1, \\dots, N$. The boundary conditions $u_{0}(t)=0$ and $u_{N+1}(t)=0$ imply $A_{0}=0$ and $A_{N+1}=0$. This system of $N$ linear homogeneous equations can be written in matrix form. Let $\\mathbf{A}$ be the column vector of amplitudes, $\\mathbf{A} = (A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N)^T$. The system is equivalent to the eigenvalue problem:\n$$\n\\frac{m\\omega^2}{K} \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{A}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{D}$ is an $N \\times N$ symmetric, tridiagonal matrix:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2  -1  0  \\cdots  0 \\\\\n-1  2  -1  \\cdots  0 \\\\\n0  -1  2  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots  \\ddots  -1 \\\\\n0  0  \\cdots  -1  2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{D}$ are $\\lambda_s = m\\omega_s^2/K$, from which we can determine the normal mode frequencies $\\omega_s$.\n\nPart 2: Normal Mode Shapes and Frequencies\n\nTo solve the eigenvalue problem, we propose a standing wave solution for the amplitudes $A_n$ that satisfies the boundary conditions. Let us try an ansatz of the form $A_n = C \\sin(qn)$, where $q$ is a dimensionless wavevector.\nThe boundary condition $A_{0}=0$ is automatically satisfied since $\\sin(q \\cdot 0) = 0$.\nThe boundary condition $A_{N+1}=0$ requires $C\\sin(q(N+1)) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($C \\neq 0$), we must have:\n$$\nq(N+1) = s\\pi, \\quad s \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nThis quantizes the wavevector: $q_s = \\frac{s\\pi}{N+1}$. The index $s$ can be restricted to $s=1, 2, \\dots, N$, as these values generate $N$ linearly independent and physically distinct modes. For $s=0$ or $s=N+1$, $A_n=0$ for all $n$, which is the trivial solution.\n\nNow, we substitute the solution $A_{n} = \\sin(q_s n)$ back into the discrete equation of motion for the amplitudes:\n$$\n\\frac{m\\omega_s^2}{K} \\sin(q_s n) = 2\\sin(q_s n) - \\sin(q_s(n-1)) - \\sin(q_s(n+1))\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(A-B) + \\sin(A+B) = 2\\sin(A)\\cos(B)$, we have $\\sin(q_s n - q_s) + \\sin(q_s n + q_s) = 2\\sin(q_s n)\\cos(q_s)$.\nThe right-hand side becomes:\n$$\n2\\sin(q_s n) - (\\sin(q_s n - q_s) + \\sin(q_s n + q_s)) = 2\\sin(q_s n) - 2\\sin(q_s n)\\cos(q_s) = 2\\sin(q_s n)(1 - \\cos(q_s))\n$$\nThe equation thus simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{m\\omega_s^2}{K} \\sin(q_s n) = 2(1 - \\cos(q_s)) \\sin(q_s n)\n$$\nFor a non-trivial mode, we can divide by $\\sin(q_s n)$, which gives the dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\frac{m\\omega_s^2}{K} = 2(1 - \\cos(q_s))\n$$\nUsing the half-angle identity $1 - \\cos(x) = 2\\sin^2(x/2)$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{m\\omega_s^2}{K} = 4\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{q_s}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for the angular frequency $\\omega_s$ and taking the positive root yields:\n$$\n\\omega_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{4K}{m}} \\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{q_s}{2}\\right)\\right| = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}} \\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{s\\pi}{2(N+1)}\\right)\\right|\n$$\nFor $s=1, 2, \\dots, N$, the argument of the sine function $\\frac{s\\pi}{2(N+1)}$ lies in the interval $(0, \\pi/2)$, where the sine is positive. Thus, the absolute value is redundant. The normal mode shapes and their corresponding angular frequencies are:\n$$\nA_{n,s} = C_s \\sin\\left(\\frac{s n \\pi}{N+1}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\omega_s = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{s\\pi}{2(N+1)}\\right)\n$$\nfor $s=1, 2, \\dots, N$. All these frequencies $\\omega_s$ are non-zero.\n\nPart 3: Product of Normal-Mode Frequencies\n\nWe must evaluate the product $P_N = \\prod_{s=1}^{N} \\omega_s$. The problem requests this to be done using fundamental matrix properties. The eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mathbf{D}$ from Part 1 are $\\lambda_s = m\\omega_s^2/K$. The product of the eigenvalues of a matrix is equal to its determinant. Therefore:\n$$\n\\prod_{s=1}^{N} \\lambda_s = \\prod_{s=1}^{N} \\frac{m\\omega_s^2}{K} = \\det(\\mathbf{D})\n$$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{m}{K}\\right)^N \\prod_{s=1}^{N} \\omega_s^2 = \\det(\\mathbf{D})\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{m}{K}\\right)^N (P_N)^2 = \\det(\\mathbf{D})\n$$\nOur task reduces to finding the determinant of the $N \\times N$ matrix $\\mathbf{D}$. Let $D_n = \\det(\\mathbf{D}_n)$, where $\\mathbf{D}_n$ is the $n \\times n$ version of matrix $\\mathbf{D}$. By performing a cofactor expansion along the first row of $\\mathbf{D}_n$, we obtain a recurrence relation for $D_n$:\n$$\nD_n = 2 D_{n-1} - (-1) \\det\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1  -1  \\cdots \\\\\n0  2  \\cdots \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= 2 D_{n-1} - (-1)(-1)D_{n-2} = 2 D_{n-1} - D_{n-2}\n$$\nfor $n \\ge 3$. We compute the first few determinants directly:\n$D_1 = \\det(2) = 2$.\n$D_2 = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 3$.\n$D_3 = 2 D_2 - D_1 = 2(3) - 2 = 4$.\nWe hypothesize that $D_n = n+1$. We can prove this by induction. The base cases $n=1, 2, 3$ are correct. Assume $D_k = k+1$ for $k  n$. Then the recurrence relation gives:\n$$\nD_n = 2 D_{n-1} - D_{n-2} = 2((n-1)+1) - ((n-2)+1) = 2n - (n-1) = n+1\n$$\nThe formula holds. Thus, for our $N \\times N$ matrix, $\\det(\\mathbf{D}) = N+1$.\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for $P_N$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{m}{K}\\right)^N (P_N)^2 = N+1\n$$\n$$\n(P_N)^2 = \\left(\\frac{K}{m}\\right)^N (N+1)\n$$\nSince all frequencies $\\omega_s$ are positive for $s=1, \\dots, N$, their product $P_N$ must also be positive. Taking the positive square root gives the final result:\n$$\nP_N = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{K}{m}\\right)^N (N+1)} = \\left(\\frac{K}{m}\\right)^{N/2} \\sqrt{N+1}\n$$\nThis expression depends only on $N$, $K$, and $m$, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{K}{m}\\right)^{N/2} \\sqrt{N+1}}\n$$", "id": "2836192"}]}
