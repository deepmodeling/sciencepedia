To characterize its crystal structure, they perform an electron diffraction experiment. The resulting diffraction pattern is indexed with respect to a set of conventional 2D lattice vectors, $\\mathbf{a}_c$ and $\\mathbf{b}_c$, which are chosen for convenience (e.g., to be orthogonal).

The intensity of a diffracted beam corresponding to indices $(h, k)$ is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the structure factor, $F_{hk}$. The structure factor is given by a sum over all atoms in the unit cell:\n$$F_{hk} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} f_j \\exp[2\\pi i (hx_j + ky_j)]$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of atoms in the unit cell, $f_j$ is the atomic scattering factor of the $j$-th atom, and $(x_j, y_j)$ are the fractional coordinates of the $j$-th atom within the conventional unit cell defined by $\\mathbf{a}_c$ and $\\mathbf{b}_c$.\n\nThe problem states that diffraction spots are observed only when $h+k=2n$ (where $n$ is an integer), which means spots are absent when $h+k$ is an odd number. These systematic absences arise from destructive interference caused by the arrangement of atoms within the conventional unit cell. This indicates that the conventional unit cell is not primitive and must contain more than one lattice point.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the lattice is a centered lattice. In a 2D centered lattice, there are two identical lattice points per conventional unit cell. We can place one at the origin with fractional coordinates $(0, 0)$ and the other at the center of the cell with fractional coordinates $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$. Assuming a monoatomic basis (a single type of atom), the atomic scattering factor $f_j$ is constant, say $f$.\n\nThe structure factor for this centered arrangement is:\n$$F_{hk} = f \\exp[2\\pi i (h \\cdot 0 + k \\cdot 0)] + f \\exp[2\\pi i (h \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + k \\cdot \\frac{1}{2})]$$\n$$F_{hk} = f \\left(1 + \\exp\\left[2\\pi i \\frac{h+k}{2}\\right]\\right)$$\n$$F_{hk} = f (1 + \\exp[\\pi i (h+k)])$$\n\nThe condition for a diffraction spot to be absent is $F_{hk} = 0$. This occurs when:\n$$1 + \\exp[\\pi i (h+k)] = 0$$\n$$\\exp[\\pi i (h+k)] = -1$$\nUsing Euler's identity, $\\exp(i\\theta) = -1$ when $\\theta = (2n+1)\\pi$ for any integer $n$.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$$\\pi (h+k) = (2n+1)\\pi$$\n$$h+k = 2n+1$$\nThis means that the sum $h+k$ must be an odd integer for the diffraction spot to be absent. Consequently, diffraction spots are present only when $h+k$ is an even integer. This matches the experimental observation given in the problem statement. Thus, the real-space lattice is a centered lattice.\n\nNow we must find the primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}_p$ and $\\mathbf{b}_p$ that generate this centered lattice. The set of all lattice points $\\mathbf{R}$ in the centered lattice can be described by integer linear combinations of the conventional vectors, with an additional basis vector for the centering:\n$$\\mathbf{R} = m\\mathbf{a}_c + n\\mathbf{b}_c + \\delta \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{a}_c + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{b}_c\\right)$$\nwhere $m, n$ are integers and $\\delta$ can be 0 (for corner points) or 1 (for center points). The primitive vectors must be able to generate all these points using only integer coefficients. Let's check the options.\n\nOption A: $\\mathbf{a}_p = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{a}_c + \\mathbf{b}_c)$, $\\mathbf{b}_p = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\mathbf{a}_c + \\mathbf{b}_c)$\nA general vector in the lattice defined by these primitive vectors is $\\mathbf{R} = u\\mathbf{a}_p + v\\mathbf{b}_p$, where $u$ and $v$ are integers.\n$$\\mathbf{R} = u\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{a}_c + \\mathbf{b}_c)\\right) + v\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(-\\mathbf{a}_c + \\mathbf{b}_c)\\right)$$\n$$\\mathbf{R} = \\frac{u-v}{2}\\mathbf{a}_c + \\frac{u+v}{2}\\mathbf{b}_c$$\nLet's analyze the coefficients. Let $m' = u-v$ and $n' = u+v$. The sum of these two new integers is $m'+n' = (u-v) + (u+v) = 2u$, which is always an even number. This implies that $m'$ and $n'$ must have the same parity (both even or both odd).\nCase 1: $m'$ and $n'$ are both even. Let $m'=2m$ and $n'=2n$. Then the lattice point is $\\mathbf{R} = \\frac{2m}{2}\\mathbf{a}_c + \\frac{2n}{2}\\mathbf{b}_c = m\\mathbf{a}_c + n\\mathbf{b}_c$. This generates all the corner points of the conventional cell.\nCase 2: $m'$ and $n'$ are both odd. Let $m'=2m+1$ and $n'=2n+1$. Then the lattice point is $\\mathbf{R} = \\frac{2m+1}{2}\\mathbf{a}_c + \\frac{2n+1}{2}\\mathbf{b}_c = m\\mathbf{a}_c + n\\mathbf{b}_c + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{a}_c + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{b}_c = m\\mathbf{a}_c + n\\mathbf{b}_c + \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{a}_c + \\mathbf{b}_c)$. This generates all the center points of the conventional cell.\nSince these vectors generate all points of a centered lattice and only those points, this is the correct choice for the primitive vectors.\n\nLet's briefly analyze why other options are incorrect:\nOption B: $\\mathbf{a}_p = \\mathbf{a}_c$, $\\mathbf{b}_p = \\mathbf{b}_c$. This describes a simple (primitive) lattice where the conventional cell is already primitive. This would allow all $(h, k)$ reflections, which contradicts the problem statement.\nOption C: $\\mathbf{a}_p = \\mathbf{a}_c + \\mathbf{b}_c$, $\\mathbf{b}_p = \\mathbf{a}_c - \\mathbf{b}_c$. The area of the cell defined by these vectors is twice the area of the conventional cell. A primitive cell must have the smallest possible area, and so cannot be larger than the conventional cell.\nOption D: $\\mathbf{a}_p = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{a}_c$, $\\mathbf{b}_p = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{b}_c$. This would mean the conventional cell is a $2 \\times 2$ supercell of a smaller primitive cell. The reciprocal lattice of this smaller cell would be larger, meaning more diffraction spots, not fewer. It does not lead to systematic absences of the type $h+k=\\text{odd}$.\nOption E: $\\mathbf{a}_p = \\mathbf{a}_c$, $\\mathbf{b}_p = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{a}_c + \\mathbf{b}_c)$. This transformation does not correspond to any of the standard 2D Bravais lattices and would produce a different set of systematic absences.\n\nThus, the only option consistent with the diffraction condition for a centered lattice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1341981"}]}
