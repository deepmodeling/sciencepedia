This structure can be described by a conventional unit cell, which is a right prism with a regular hexagonal base of side length $a$ and height $c$. The atoms are modeled as hard spheres of radius $R$.\n\nWithin the basal planes of the crystal (the hexagonal faces at the top and bottom of the prism), the atoms are arranged in a close-packed formation. This means each atom is in physical contact with its six neighbors in the same plane. This packing determines the relationship between the atomic radius $R$ and the lattice parameter $a$.\n\nThe full three-dimensional structure is formed by stacking these planes. If we denote the atomic positions in the plane at $z=0$ as layer A, the subsequent layer of atoms (layer B) is located at a height $z=c/2$. The atoms in layer B are positioned directly above the centers of the triangular hollows in layer A. The layer at $z=c$ is a repetition of layer A, leading to an ABAB... stacking sequence.\n\nFor an \"ideal\" HCP structure, the spheres in adjacent layers (A and B) would also be in contact, leading to a specific ideal ratio $\\gamma_{\\text{ideal}} = c/a = \\sqrt{8/3}$. However, in many real materials, the $c/a$ ratio deviates from this value.\n\nConsider a general non-ideal HCP structure with lattice parameters $a$ and $c$, characterized by the ratio $\\gamma = c/a$. Assuming the atomic radius $R$ is determined by the close-packing condition within the basal planes, calculate the Atomic Packing Factor (APF) of this structure as a function of the ratio $\\gamma$.
