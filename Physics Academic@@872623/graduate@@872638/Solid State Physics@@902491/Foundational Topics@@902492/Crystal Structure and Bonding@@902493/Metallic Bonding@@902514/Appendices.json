The energy of an electron is given by $E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the electron's wave vector and $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$. At absolute zero temperature, the electrons occupy all available states up to a Fermi energy $E_F$. The surface in reciprocal space (k-space) corresponding to this energy is known as the Fermi surface. For free electrons, the Fermi surface is a sphere centered at the origin, with a radius known as the Fermi wave vector, $k_F$.\n\nThe periodic potential of the crystal lattice imposes a structure on k-space, dividing it into Brillouin zones. The first Brillouin zone (BZ) is the Wigner-Seitz primitive cell of the reciprocal lattice.
