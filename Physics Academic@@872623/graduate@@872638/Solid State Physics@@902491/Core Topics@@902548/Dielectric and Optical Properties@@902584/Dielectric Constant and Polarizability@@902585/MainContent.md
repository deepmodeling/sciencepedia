## Introduction
A material's response to an electric field, quantified by its dielectric constant, is a fundamental property that dictates its role in everything from simple capacitors to advanced optical and electronic devices. While this macroscopic property is easily measured, its origins lie deep within the quantum-mechanical behavior of the material's constituent atoms and molecules. A central challenge in solid-state physics is to bridge this gap, connecting the microscopic world of [atomic polarizability](@entry_id:161626) to the observable, bulk [dielectric response](@entry_id:140146). This article provides a comprehensive framework for understanding this connection. It explores how materials polarize and screen electric fields, revealing the underlying physics that governs their dielectric and optical properties.

The reader will embark on a journey from foundational concepts to modern applications. In the "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter, we will build the theoretical framework, deriving key relationships like the Clausius-Mossotti relation and the [frequency-dependent dielectric function](@entry_id:139439). Following this, the "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" chapter will demonstrate how these principles are applied to understand phenomena across [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) physics, materials science, and biophysics, from [electrostatic screening](@entry_id:138995) in metals to the dielectric environment of proteins. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section offers opportunities to solidify this knowledge by tackling practical problems related to these core concepts.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### Macroscopic Electrodynamics in Dielectrics

The response of a material to an external electric field, $\mathbf{E}_{\text{ext}}$, is fundamental to understanding its electronic and structural properties. When a [dielectric material](@entry_id:194698) is placed in such a field, its constituent charges—electrons and atomic nuclei—experience forces that cause a slight redistribution. While the material remains electrically neutral on a macroscopic scale, this charge rearrangement creates a vast number of microscopic electric dipoles. The collective effect of these induced dipoles is described by the **[polarization density](@entry_id:188176)**, $\mathbf{P}$, defined as the net electric dipole moment per unit volume.

A non-uniform polarization, $\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{r})$, can lead to a net accumulation of charge within the material. This [effective charge](@entry_id:190611), which originates from the rearrangement of charges bound within atoms or molecules, is known as the **[bound charge density](@entry_id:261642)**. A key relationship in electrostatics demonstrates that a divergence in the [polarization field](@entry_id:197617) is equivalent to a net volume density of [bound charge](@entry_id:142144), $\rho_b$. Specifically, the relation is given by $\rho_b = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{P}$. At the surface of a dielectric, a discontinuity in the normal component of $\mathbf{P}$ results in a [bound surface charge density](@entry_id:182629), $\sigma_b = \mathbf{P} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}$, where $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is the [outward-pointing normal](@entry_id:753030) vector.

Within the framework of Maxwell's equations, it is often convenient to distinguish between **free charges** ($\rho_{\text{free}}$), such as [conduction electrons](@entry_id:145260) in a metal or implanted ions, and these bound charges ($\rho_b$). The total charge density is $\rho_{\text{tot}} = \rho_{\text{free}} + \rho_b$. Gauss's law for the electric field, $\mathbf{E}$, states that its source is the total charge density: $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho_{\text{tot}}/\epsilon_0 = (\rho_{\text{free}} + \rho_b)/\epsilon_0$, where $\epsilon_0$ is the [permittivity of free space](@entry_id:272823). By substituting $\rho_b = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{P}$, we can rewrite this as $\nabla \cdot (\epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P}) = \rho_{\text{free}}$. This leads to the definition of an auxiliary field, the **[electric displacement field](@entry_id:203286)** $\mathbf{D}$, as:
$$ \mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} $$
The great utility of the $\mathbf{D}$ field lies in the fact that its sources are only the free charges, resulting in a simplified form of Gauss's law in matter: $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = \rho_{\text{free}}$. [@problem_id:2981396]

For a wide range of materials and field strengths, the induced polarization is directly proportional to the applied electric field. Such materials are termed [linear dielectrics](@entry_id:266494). If the material's response is also independent of direction, it is isotropic. For a homogeneous, isotropic, linear (HIL) material, the relationship between polarization and the electric field is captured by a **[constitutive relation](@entry_id:268485)**:
$$ \mathbf{P} = \epsilon_0 \chi_e \mathbf{E} $$
Here, $\chi_e$ is the dimensionless **[electric susceptibility](@entry_id:144209)**, a scalar quantity for an isotropic medium that quantifies its ability to be polarized by an electric field. Substituting this into the definition of $\mathbf{D}$ gives:
$$ \mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \epsilon_0 \chi_e \mathbf{E} = \epsilon_0 (1 + \chi_e) \mathbf{E} $$
This is often written more compactly as $\mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r \mathbf{E}$, where $\epsilon_r$ is the **relative permittivity**, also known as the dielectric constant. Comparing these forms immediately reveals the fundamental connection between susceptibility and relative permittivity:
$$ \epsilon_r = 1 + \chi_e $$
The susceptibility $\chi_e$ thus represents the material's contribution to the [dielectric response](@entry_id:140146) beyond that of the vacuum. [@problem_id:2981396]

### Microscopic Mechanisms of Polarization

The macroscopic susceptibility $\chi_e$ is an emergent property determined by the collective behavior of the atoms, ions, or molecules that constitute the material. At the microscopic level, the response of a single entity (e.g., an atom) to the local electric field, $\mathbf{E}_{\text{loc}}$, is characterized by its **polarizability**, $\alpha$. The [induced dipole moment](@entry_id:262417) $\mathbf{p}$ of the entity is given by $\mathbf{p} = \alpha \mathbf{E}_{\text{loc}}$. There are three primary mechanisms contributing to polarizability.

#### Electronic Polarizability

When an atom is subjected to an electric field, the negatively charged electron cloud is displaced relative to the positively charged nucleus. This separation of charge centers creates an [induced dipole moment](@entry_id:262417). This mechanism, known as **[electronic polarizability](@entry_id:275814)**, is present in all materials. We can construct a simple quantum-mechanical model to estimate its magnitude. Consider a charged particle of charge $e$ and mass $m$ bound in a one-dimensional harmonic potential $V(x) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega_0^2 x^2$. In the presence of a static electric field $E_x$, the total potential becomes $V(x) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega_0^2 x^2 - eE_x x$. By [completing the square](@entry_id:265480), this potential can be rewritten as a shifted harmonic oscillator, $V(x) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega_0^2 (x - x_0)^2 - \frac{1}{2}m\omega_0^2 x_0^2$, where the equilibrium position is shifted to $x_0 = eE_x / (m\omega_0^2)$. In the quantum ground state, the expectation value of the position is $\langle x \rangle = x_0$. The [induced dipole moment](@entry_id:262417) is therefore $p_x = e\langle x \rangle = e^2 E_x / (m\omega_0^2)$. From the definition $p_x = \alpha_{\text{elec}} E_x$ (assuming the local field is approximately the applied field for a dilute system), we find the [electronic polarizability](@entry_id:275814) to be:
$$ \alpha_{\text{elec}} = \frac{e^2}{m\omega_0^2} $$
This simple model reveals that [electronic polarizability](@entry_id:275814) is determined by the fundamental constants of the charge carrier and the "stiffness" of the binding potential, represented by the resonant frequency $\omega_0$. [@problem_id:68950]

#### Ionic Polarizability

In [ionic crystals](@entry_id:138598), such as NaCl, the constituent ions are already charged. An electric field pushes the positive ions (e.g., $\text{Na}^+$) in one direction and the negative ions (e.g., $\text{Cl}^-$) in the opposite direction. This relative displacement of the sublattices creates a net dipole moment per unit cell, giving rise to **[ionic polarizability](@entry_id:267191)**. This mechanism is intrinsically linked to the [lattice vibrations](@entry_id:145169) (phonons) of the crystal, as the restoring force against the displacement is provided by the interatomic forces.

#### Orientational Polarizability

Materials composed of molecules that possess a permanent intrinsic dipole moment ([polar molecules](@entry_id:144673)), such as water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), exhibit a third type of polarizability. In the absence of an external field, these permanent dipoles are randomly oriented due to thermal agitation, resulting in zero net polarization. When an electric field is applied, it exerts a torque on each dipole, tending to align it with the field. This alignment is opposed by the randomizing effect of thermal energy. The result is a net statistical alignment, producing a [macroscopic polarization](@entry_id:141855). This is known as **[orientational polarizability](@entry_id:262783)**.

Using classical statistical mechanics, we can derive its value in the low-field limit ($p_0 E \ll k_B T$), where $p_0$ is the magnitude of the [permanent dipole moment](@entry_id:163961), $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The average component of the dipole moment parallel to the field is found by averaging over all possible orientations, weighted by the Boltzmann factor $e^{-U/(k_B T)}$, where the potential energy is $U = -\mathbf{p}_0 \cdot \mathbf{E}$. This calculation yields the Langevin function, which for small fields approximates to a linear response. The resulting [orientational polarizability](@entry_id:262783) per molecule is:
$$ \alpha_{\text{orient}} = \frac{p_0^2}{3k_B T} $$
A key feature of [orientational polarizability](@entry_id:262783) is its inverse dependence on temperature. At higher temperatures, thermal motion is more vigorous, making it harder for the external field to align the dipoles, thus reducing the polarizability. [@problem_id:68917]

The total polarizability of a molecule is the sum of these contributions: $\alpha = \alpha_{\text{elec}} + \alpha_{\text{ionic}} + \alpha_{\text{orient}}$. Since electronic and ionic polarizabilities involve the deformation of atoms or the lattice, they are often called distortion polarizabilities and are largely independent of temperature.

### The Local Field and the Clausius-Mossotti Relation

A crucial step in connecting the microscopic polarizability $\alpha$ to the macroscopic susceptibility $\chi_e$ is to determine the actual electric field experienced by an atom or molecule within the dense medium. This **local field**, $\mathbf{E}_{\text{loc}}$, is not equal to the macroscopic average field $\mathbf{E}$. The macroscopic field is an average over a volume containing many atoms, whereas the local field at a specific site is the field from all other sources in the universe *at that site*. It is the sum of the external field and the field produced by all other dipoles in the material.

For a dense, [isotropic material](@entry_id:204616) with cubic [crystal symmetry](@entry_id:138731), a powerful method for calculating the local field is the **Lorentz construction**. We imagine carving out a small, conceptually spherical cavity around the atomic site of interest. The [local field](@entry_id:146504) at the center of this cavity can be calculated as the sum of three contributions:
1.  The field from charges outside the Lorentz sphere. Since the sphere is large on an atomic scale, the material outside can be treated as a continuous medium with uniform polarization $\mathbf{P}$. The field at the center of a spherical cavity in a uniformly polarized medium can be shown to be $\mathbf{E}_{\text{cavity}} = \mathbf{P} / (3\epsilon_0)$.
2.  The macroscopic field $\mathbf{E}$, which is the average field in the dielectric.
3.  The field from the discrete dipoles *inside* the spherical cavity (excluding the one at the center). For a cubic lattice, due to the high degree of symmetry, the vector sum of the fields from these near-neighbor dipoles at the center is exactly zero.

Combining these contributions, the Lorentz local field is given by:
$$ \mathbf{E}_{\text{loc}} = \mathbf{E} + \frac{\mathbf{P}}{3\epsilon_0} $$
This result shows that in a dense dielectric, the local field is enhanced by the polarization of the surrounding medium. [@problem_id:2981422]

With this expression for the local field, we can now bridge the microscopic and macroscopic scales. We start with the microscopic relation $\mathbf{p} = \alpha \mathbf{E}_{\text{loc}}$ and the macroscopic definition $\mathbf{P} = N\mathbf{p}$, where $N$ is the number density of polarizable entities. Combining these gives $\mathbf{P} = N\alpha \mathbf{E}_{\text{loc}}$. Substituting the Lorentz field and the [constitutive relation](@entry_id:268485) $\mathbf{P} = \epsilon_0(\epsilon_r - 1)\mathbf{E}$, we can eliminate $\mathbf{P}$, $\mathbf{E}_{\text{loc}}$, and $\mathbf{E}$ to arrive at a relation between the macroscopic [dielectric constant](@entry_id:146714) $\epsilon_r$ and the microscopic polarizability $\alpha$. This celebrated result is the **Clausius-Mossotti relation**:
$$ \frac{\epsilon_r - 1}{\epsilon_r + 2} = \frac{N\alpha}{3\epsilon_0} $$
This equation is a cornerstone of dielectric theory, providing a direct link from atomic-scale properties ($\alpha$) to a measurable bulk property ($\epsilon_r$). [@problem_id:2981422]

The Clausius-Mossotti relation leads to a striking prediction. The [local field](@entry_id:146504) term $\mathbf{P}/(3\epsilon_0)$ indicates a positive feedback mechanism: the polarization contributes to the [local field](@entry_id:146504), which in turn increases the polarization. If the product $N\alpha$ becomes large enough, this feedback can become self-sustaining. The relation predicts that $\epsilon_r$ will diverge to infinity when the right-hand side approaches 1. This is known as the **ferroelectric catastrophe**.
$$ \frac{N\alpha_{\text{crit}}}{3\epsilon_0} = 1 $$
This condition signals a phase transition to a state of spontaneous polarization, where a non-zero $\mathbf{P}$ exists even in the absence of an external field ($\mathbf{E}=0$). This is the defining characteristic of a **ferroelectric** material. For a hypothetical crystal made of perfectly conducting spheres of radius $R$ on a [simple cubic lattice](@entry_id:160687) with [lattice constant](@entry_id:158935) $a$, the polarizability is $\alpha = 4\pi\epsilon_0 R^3$ and the number density is $N=1/a^3$. The critical condition for the ferroelectric catastrophe is met when the ratio $(R/a)$ reaches the critical value $(R/a)_{\text{crit}} = (3/4\pi)^{1/3}$. [@problem_id:69088]

### Dynamic and Frequency-Dependent Response

Thus far, our discussion has focused on static fields. However, the response of a dielectric to [time-varying fields](@entry_id:180620), such as electromagnetic waves, is of immense importance. The inertia of charges means that polarization cannot respond instantaneously to a changing field. This leads to a frequency-dependent, and generally complex, dielectric function $\epsilon(\omega)$.
$$ \epsilon(\omega) = \epsilon_1(\omega) + i \epsilon_2(\omega) $$
The real part, $\epsilon_1(\omega)$, relates to the component of polarization in phase with the field and determines the material's refractive index. The imaginary part, $\epsilon_2(\omega)$, corresponds to the out-of-phase component of polarization, which leads to the absorption of energy from the field and dissipation as heat.

#### The Lorentz Oscillator Model

A powerful and intuitive model for the [frequency response](@entry_id:183149) of bound charges (both electronic and ionic) is the **Lorentz oscillator model**. It treats the system as a collection of damped harmonic oscillators driven by the electric field. For a single resonance, this model predicts a [dielectric function](@entry_id:136859) of the form:
$$ \epsilon(\omega) = 1 + \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - i\omega\gamma} $$
Here, $\omega_0$ is the natural resonant frequency of the oscillator, $\gamma$ is the damping constant representing dissipative processes, and $\omega_p$ is the **plasma frequency**, a parameter related to the density of oscillators $N$ and their effective mass and charge. The imaginary part of this function, which describes absorption, is:
$$ \epsilon_2(\omega) = \frac{\omega_p^2 \gamma\omega}{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + (\gamma\omega)^2} $$
This function has a peak centered at the [resonant frequency](@entry_id:265742) $\omega_0$, known as a Lorentzian lineshape. [@problem_id:68958]

#### Lattice Vibrations in Ionic Crystals

In an ionic crystal, the [ionic polarization](@entry_id:145365) mechanism gives rise to a strong resonance in the infrared region of the spectrum. The resonant frequency corresponds to the frequency of the **transverse optical (TO) phonons**, $\omega_T$. These are lattice vibrations where adjacent positive and negative ions move in opposite directions, creating an [oscillating dipole](@entry_id:262983) moment that can couple directly to [transverse electromagnetic waves](@entry_id:264727). The dielectric function for a simple ionic crystal can be modeled by a specialized form of the Lorentz oscillator:
$$ \epsilon(\omega) = \epsilon_\infty + \frac{(\epsilon_s - \epsilon_\infty)\omega_T^2}{\omega_T^2 - \omega^2 - i\omega\gamma} $$
Here, $\epsilon_s$ is the static dielectric constant ($\omega \to 0$), which includes contributions from both ionic and [electronic polarization](@entry_id:145269). $\epsilon_\infty$ is the high-frequency [dielectric constant](@entry_id:146714) ($\omega \gg \omega_T$ but still below electronic transition frequencies), where the massive ions can no longer respond, and only the lightweight electrons contribute to polarization. [@problem_id:69023]

This model reveals a crucial feature of [ionic crystals](@entry_id:138598). While the pole of $\epsilon(\omega)$ occurs at the TO phonon frequency $\omega_T$, the frequency at which $\epsilon(\omega)$ becomes zero also has a special physical significance. A zero in the [dielectric function](@entry_id:136859) allows for a longitudinal electric field to exist even when the [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) $\mathbf{D}$ is zero. This condition supports **longitudinal optical (LO) phonons**, which are [longitudinal vibrations](@entry_id:176640) that create a macroscopic [longitudinal polarization](@entry_id:202391) field. Setting the (undamped) [dielectric function](@entry_id:136859) to zero, $\epsilon(\omega_L) = 0$, we find:
$$ \epsilon_\infty + \frac{(\epsilon_s - \epsilon_\infty)\omega_T^2}{\omega_T^2 - \omega_L^2} = 0 $$
Solving for the ratio of the squared frequencies yields the famous **Lyddane-Sachs-Teller (LST) relation**:
$$ \frac{\omega_L^2}{\omega_T^2} = \frac{\epsilon_s}{\epsilon_\infty} $$
This elegant relation connects the microscopic phonon frequencies ($\omega_L, \omega_T$) to the macroscopic, measurable dielectric constants ($\epsilon_s, \epsilon_\infty$). Since $\epsilon_s > \epsilon_\infty$ (as it includes the ionic contribution), the LST relation implies that $\omega_L > \omega_T$. The frequency range between $\omega_T$ and $\omega_L$ is a region of high reflectivity for the crystal, known as the Reststrahlen band. [@problem_id:69023]

### Fundamental Constraints and Generalizations

The [dielectric function](@entry_id:136859) is not arbitrary; it is constrained by fundamental physical principles.

#### Causality and Kramers-Kronig Relations

The principle of **causality**—that a response cannot precede its cause—imposes a powerful mathematical structure on any [linear response function](@entry_id:160418), including $\epsilon(\omega)$. Specifically, it requires that $\epsilon(\omega)$ be an analytic function in the upper half of the [complex frequency plane](@entry_id:190333). A direct mathematical consequence of this [analyticity](@entry_id:140716) is that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function are not independent. They are related by [integral transforms](@entry_id:186209) known as the **Kramers-Kronig relations**. One such relation allows the static real part of the susceptibility, $\chi_1(0)$, to be determined from the entire [absorption spectrum](@entry_id:144611), $\chi_2(\omega)$:
$$ \chi_1(0) = \frac{2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\chi_2(\omega')}{\omega'} d\omega' $$
Since energy must be dissipated for any absorption process ($\omega' > 0$), we must have $\chi_2(\omega') \ge 0$. This integral relation therefore proves that the static susceptibility $\chi_1(0)$ of any stable, causal material must be non-negative. As a practical example, one can calculate $\chi_1(0)$ for any given [absorption spectrum](@entry_id:144611), such as one composed of sharp resonances and broad absorption bands, by directly evaluating this integral. [@problem_id:69056]

#### Sum Rules

Another set of fundamental constraints are **sum rules**, which are integral relationships that the dielectric function must obey. One of the most important is the **[f-sum rule](@entry_id:147775)** (or Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule). It can be derived from the Kramers-Kronig relations or from fundamental quantum mechanics. For the Lorentz oscillator model, direct integration yields:
$$ \int_0^\infty \omega \epsilon_2(\omega) d\omega = \frac{\pi}{2}\omega_p^2 $$
This remarkable result states that the integrated absorption strength over all frequencies is not arbitrary but is fixed by the [plasma frequency](@entry_id:137429), which is proportional to the total number density of oscillators. It implies that if absorption is strong in one frequency range, it must be weaker in others to conserve the total integrated strength. [@problem_id:68958]

#### Spatial Dispersion: The Dielectric Function $\epsilon(\mathbf{k}, \omega)$

Our discussion has implicitly assumed that the polarization at a point $\mathbf{r}$ depends only on the electric field at that same point. This is the **local approximation**, valid when the wavelength of the electric field is much larger than any relevant microscopic correlation length in the material (e.g., lattice constant, [electron mean free path](@entry_id:185806)). When the field varies rapidly in space, this approximation breaks down. The polarization at $\mathbf{r}$ may depend on the field in a neighborhood around $\mathbf{r}$. This non-local behavior is known as **[spatial dispersion](@entry_id:141344)**.

To describe this, the dielectric function must depend not only on frequency $\omega$ but also on the wavevector $\mathbf{k}$: $\epsilon(\mathbf{k}, \omega)$. The local approximation $\epsilon(\omega)$ is then formally the long-wavelength limit of the general function, $\epsilon(\omega) = \lim_{\mathbf{k} \to \mathbf{0}} \epsilon(\mathbf{k}, \omega)$. The condition for this approximation to be valid is $|k|\ell \ll 1$, where $\ell$ is the characteristic microscopic length scale. [@problem_id:2981432]

The distinction between insulators and conductors becomes particularly sharp when considering the static, uniform limit ($\omega \to 0$, $\mathbf{k} \to \mathbf{0}$). In an insulator, the limits can be interchanged, and $\epsilon(\mathbf{k} \to \mathbf{0}, \omega \to 0) = \epsilon_r(0)$, a finite value. In a conductor, however, the limits do not commute. Taking the uniform field limit first ($\mathbf{k} \to \mathbf{0}$) and then the [static limit](@entry_id:262480) ($\omega \to 0$) leads to a divergence in $\epsilon(\mathbf{0}, \omega)$ because of the material's finite DC conductivity. This divergence reflects the ability of free charges to move and perfectly screen a static electric field. [@problem_id:2981432] [@problem_id:2981432]

#### The Modern Theory of Polarization

We conclude by addressing a subtle but profound issue in the very definition of polarization in a crystalline solid. In a finite sample, the [macroscopic polarization](@entry_id:141855) $\mathbf{P}$ is well-defined. However, in an infinite periodic crystal, the choice of the unit cell boundary is arbitrary. Shifting the boundary can change the number of charges assigned to the surface, altering the calculated surface charge $\sigma_b = \mathbf{P} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}$ and thus implying a different bulk $\mathbf{P}$. This suggests that the absolute value of $\mathbf{P}$ is not uniquely defined for a bulk crystal.

The **[modern theory of polarization](@entry_id:266948)**, developed in the 1990s using the concept of the Berry phase, resolves this ambiguity. It demonstrates that while the absolute value of $\mathbf{P}$ is indeed ill-defined, *changes* in polarization, $\Delta\mathbf{P}$, during an [adiabatic process](@entry_id:138150) (e.g., in response to an applied field or atomic displacement) are perfectly well-defined and can be calculated from the bulk electronic structure. The change in polarization is related to the flow of [microscopic current](@entry_id:184920) density $\mathbf{J}$ via $\Delta\mathbf{P} = \int dt \langle \mathbf{J}(t) \rangle$. [@problem_id:2981393]

This theory shows that the bulk polarization is a multi-valued quantity, forming a "lattice" of possible values. Any two physically equivalent values of $\mathbf{P}$ differ by a **polarization quantum**, $\mathbf{P}_q = e\mathbf{R}/\Omega$, where $\mathbf{R}$ is a lattice vector of the crystal and $\Omega$ is the unit cell volume. This quantum corresponds to the change in polarization caused by displacing one elementary charge $e$ across a unit cell. Crucially, [physical observables](@entry_id:154692) must be unique. Response functions like the [electric susceptibility](@entry_id:144209) $\chi_e = (1/\epsilon_0)\partial \mathbf{P} / \partial \mathbf{E}$ are derivatives of the polarization. Since the polarization quantum is a constant vector with respect to the applied field, its derivative is zero. Therefore, calculated susceptibilities are invariant under the choice of polarization branch and are uniquely defined, resolving the paradox and placing the theory of dielectrics on a firm quantum-mechanical foundation. [@problem_id:2981393]
