These excitons are typically observed in optical absorption spectra at low temperatures as a series of discrete energy peaks just below the semiconductor's band gap energy. The energy levels of a Wannier-Mott exciton, relative to the continuum of free electron-hole pairs, can be modeled by a hydrogen-like formula:\n$$E_n = -\\frac{R_{ex}}{n^2}$$\nwhere $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$ is the principal quantum number and $R_{ex}$ is the exciton Rydberg energy, a constant specific to the material. An optical absorption experiment on a certain semiconductor material reveals that the energy corresponding to the ground state ($n=1$) exciton is $E_1 = -21.4$ meV.\n\nWhat is the minimum photon energy required to break apart (ionize) an exciton that is in its first excited state ($n=2$)?

Ionization means elevating the exciton to the continuum, where its energy is defined as zero. Therefore, the ionization energy from a state $n$ is the energy difference between the continuum ($E=0$) and the energy of that state, $E_n$. This is given by $E_{ion, n} = 0 - E_n = -E_n$.\n\nWe are given the energy levels of the Wannier-Mott exciton as:\n$$E_n = -\\frac{R_{ex}}{n^2}$$\nwhere $R_{ex}$ is the exciton Rydberg energy and $n$ is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem provides the energy of the ground state, which corresponds to $n=1$:\n$$E_1 = -21.4 \\text{ meV}$$\n\nUsing the given formula for $n=1$, we have:\n$$E_1 = -\\frac{R_{ex}}{1^2} = -R_{ex}$$\nFrom this, we can determine the exciton Rydberg energy for this material:\n$$R_{ex} = -E_1 = -(-21.4 \\text{ meV}) = 21.4 \\text{ meV}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the energy of the first excited state, which corresponds to $n=2$.
