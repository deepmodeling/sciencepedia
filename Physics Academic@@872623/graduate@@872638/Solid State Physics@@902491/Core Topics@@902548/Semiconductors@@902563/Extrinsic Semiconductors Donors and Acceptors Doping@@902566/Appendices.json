The crystal is doped with Silicon (Si) atoms at a total volume concentration of $N_{Si}$. In GaAs, Silicon is an amphoteric dopant: it can act as a donor when it substitutes a Gallium atom (Si$_{Ga}$) or as an acceptor when it substitutes an Arsenic atom (Si$_{As}$). It is found that a fraction $f_D$ of the total silicon atoms occupy Gallium sites, while the remaining fraction $(1-f_D)$ occupy Arsenic sites.\n\nTo further tailor the material's properties, the GaAs crystal is also co-doped with Carbon (C) atoms at a volume concentration of $N_C$. Carbon in GaAs acts exclusively as an acceptor.\n\nA region within a device fabricated from this material is designed to be fully depleted.

This problem delves into the fascinating quantum mechanics of donor-acceptor pair (DAP) luminescence, where spin selection rules play a decisive role. You will use steady-state rate equations to analyze the competition between different recombination pathways, providing insight into the efficiency and characteristics of light emission in these materials [@problem_id:101293].", "problem": "In a semiconductor at low temperatures, donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) provide a significant channel for radiative recombination. A DAP consists of an electron bound to a donor and a hole bound to an acceptor. The electron and hole are both spin-1/2 particles, and their combined system can exist in either a spin-singlet state (total spin $S=0$, degeneracy $g_S=1$) or a spin-triplet state ($S=1$, degeneracy $g_T=3$).\n\nThe spin-exchange interaction between the electron and the hole lifts the degeneracy between these states, resulting in an energy splitting $\\Delta E_{ST} = E_T - E_S$, where $E_T$ and $E_S$ are the energies of the triplet and singlet states, respectively. We assume the triplet state is higher in energy, so $\\Delta E_{ST} > 0$.\n\nRadiative recombination is a spin-conserving process, meaning only the singlet state can directly recombine to the spin-zero crystal ground state, with a high rate $W_S$. The triplet state is \"dark\" or \"forbidden\" but can have a small, non-zero intrinsic radiative recombination rate $W_T$ due to other weaker interactions, with $W_T \\ll W_S$.\n\nPairs are created with random spin orientations, so the generation rate into the singlet manifold ($G_S$) and the triplet manifold ($G_T$) are proportional to their respective degeneracies: $G_T = 3G_S$.\n\nAt the very low temperatures considered ($k_B T \\ll \\Delta E_{ST}$), thermal excitation from the singlet to the triplet state is negligible. However, spin-flip processes can induce non-radiative transitions from the triplet manifold to the singlet state with a rate $W_{sf}$. This rate is modeled as the sum of two contributions: a constant, exchange-independent rate $W_0$ and an exchange-dependent rate $W_{ex}$. The exchange-dependent rate is found to be proportional to the square of the exchange splitting, i.e., $W_{ex} = A (\\Delta E_{ST})^2$, where $A$ is a constant. The total spin-flip rate is thus $W_{sf} = W_0 + A (\\Delta E_{ST})^2$.\n\nAssuming the system is under continuous excitation and has reached a steady state, derive an expression for the ratio of the total time-averaged luminescence intensity from the triplet states, $I_T$, to that from the singlet state, $I_S$. Note that the luminescence intensity from a state is proportional to its steady-state population multiplied by its radiative recombination rate. Your final answer should be expressed in terms of $W_T$, $W_0$, $A$, and $\\Delta E_{ST}$.", "solution": "To find the ratio of luminescence intensities, $\\frac{I_T}{I_S}$, we first establish the steady-state rate equations for the singlet ($N_S$) and triplet ($N_T$) populations. The intensity from each state is its population multiplied by its radiative rate: $I_T = N_T W_T$ and $I_S = N_S W_S$.\n\nAt steady state, the population of each state is constant. For the triplet state, the generation rate ($G_T=3G_S$) must balance the loss rates from spin-flip ($W_{sf}$) and radiative recombination ($W_T$).
