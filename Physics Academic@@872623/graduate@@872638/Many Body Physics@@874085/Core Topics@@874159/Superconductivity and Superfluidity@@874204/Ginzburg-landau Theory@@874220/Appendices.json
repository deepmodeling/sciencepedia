The problem asks for the characteristic length scale of small perturbations around the uniform equilibrium state for $T  T_c$.\n\nFirst, we find the uniform equilibrium magnetization, $m_0$. In a uniform state, the order parameter $m(x)$ is constant, so its derivative $\\frac{dm}{dx} = 0$. The free energy functional simplifies to an integral over a potential energy density, $V(m)$:\n$$ F[m_0] = \\int V(m_0) dx $$\nwhere $V(m) = \\frac{a}{2}(T-T_c)m^2 + \\frac{b}{4}m^4$.\nTo find the value of $m$ that minimizes this potential, we take the derivative of $V(m)$ with respect to $m$ and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dm} = a(T-T_c)m + bm^3 = 0 $$\n$$ m(a(T-T_c) + bm^2) = 0 $$\nThis gives two possible solutions: $m=0$ or $m^2 = -\\frac{a(T-T_c)}{b}$.\nThe problem specifies that $T  T_c$, so $T-T_c$ is negative.
