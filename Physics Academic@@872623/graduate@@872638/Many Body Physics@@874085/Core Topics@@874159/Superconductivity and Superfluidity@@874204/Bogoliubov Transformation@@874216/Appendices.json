This exercise applies the formalism to a superconductor subjected to an external magnetic field, which interacts with electron spins via the Zeeman effect. By calculating the quasiparticle spectrum, we can determine the critical field at which the superconducting energy gap closes, providing a classic example of a competition between pairing and magnetism. [@problem_id:1100145]", "problem": "In the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity, electrons with opposite momenta and spins form Cooper pairs. At zero temperature, these pairs condense into a macroscopic quantum state separated from single-particle-like excitations by an energy gap $\\Delta_0$. An external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ affects the superconducting state in two ways: through the orbital motion of electrons (Meissner effect) and through the spin (Zeeman effect).\n\nThis problem focuses on the Zeeman effect, which tends to break Cooper pairs. A spin-up electron has its energy shifted by $+\\mu_B B$ and a spin-down by $-\\mu_B B$, where $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. This energy difference makes spin-singlet pairing energetically less favorable. When the magnetic energy becomes comparable to the pairing energy, superconductivity can be destroyed. This is known as the Chandrasekhar-Clogston or paramagnetic limit.\n\nThe behavior of the elementary excitations (quasiparticles) in a superconductor under a magnetic field can be described by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism.

We are given the mean-field Hamiltonian and are told to assume the gap parameter $\\Delta$ is a constant $\\Delta_0$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian couples particle and hole states. To find the excitation spectrum, we diagonalize it. The Hamiltonian can be structured in a matrix form using Nambu-Gorkov spinors. The pairing term couples the state $(k, \\uparrow)$ with $(-k, \\downarrow)$ and the state $(k, \\downarrow)$ with $(-k, \\uparrow)$. Due to this structure, the Hamiltonian decouples into independent $2 \\times 2$ blocks for each pair of coupled states.\n\nLet's first consider the subspace spanned by the basis vectors corresponding to creating an electron $(k, \\uparrow)$ and a hole $(-k, \\downarrow)$. We use the Nambu spinor $\\Psi_{k, \\uparrow}^\\dagger = (c_{k\\uparrow}^\\dagger, c_{-k\\downarrow})$.

The possible positive excitation energies are given by $E_k^0 + \\mu_B B$ and $|E_k^0 - \\mu_B B|$.\n\nThe superconducting energy gap, $E_{gap}$, is the minimum energy required to create any quasiparticle excitation. To find it, we must find the minimum of the positive excitation energies over all possible momenta $k$. The energy $E_k^0 = \\sqrt{\\xi_k^2 + \\Delta_0^2}$ has a minimum value when $\\xi_k = 0$ (i.e., for electrons at the Fermi surface), where it equals $\\Delta_0$.\n\nLet's find the minimum of each branch of positive energies:\n1. Minimum of $E_k^0 + \\mu_B B$: This occurs at $\\xi_k=0$, and the minimum value is $\\Delta_0 + \\mu_B B$.\n2. Minimum of $|E_k^0 - \\mu_B B|$: This also occurs at $\\xi_k=0$, and the minimum value is $|\\Delta_0 - \\mu_B B|$.\n\nThe overall energy gap $E_{gap}$ is the minimum of these two values:\n$$\nE_{gap} = \\min(\\Delta_0 + \\mu_B B, |\\Delta_0 - \\mu_B B|)\n$$\nSince $\\Delta_0 > 0$ and we consider $B \\ge 0$, $\\Delta_0 + \\mu_B B$ is always positive and larger than or equal to $|\\Delta_0 - \\mu_B B|$.
