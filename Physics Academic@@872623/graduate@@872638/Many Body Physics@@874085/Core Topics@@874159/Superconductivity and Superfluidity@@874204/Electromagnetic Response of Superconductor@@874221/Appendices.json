However, this expulsion is not perfect; the field penetrates a short distance from the surface, decaying exponentially. This exercise allows you to apply the fundamental London equation to determine the precise magnetic field distribution within a superconducting slab of finite thickness, providing a quantitative understanding of the screening process and the significance of the London penetration depth, $\\lambda_L$.

Within the framework of the London theory, the magnetic field penetration into the superconductor is characterized by the London penetration depth, $\\lambda_L$. The slab is infinite in the y-z plane and occupies the region $-d/2 \\le x \\le d/2$. The external magnetic field is applied along the z-axis, $\\vec{H}_{ext} = H_0 \\hat{z}$. The applied field is weak enough that the material remains in the Meissner state throughout.\n\nDetermine the magnetic field distribution $B(x)$ inside the slab for the specific case where the thickness is $d = 4\\lambda_L$. Express your answer in terms of $H_0$, $\\lambda_L$, the permeability of free space $\\mu_0$, and the coordinate $x$.", "solution": "The behavior of the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ inside a superconductor in the Meissner state is described by the London equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\vec{B} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_L^2} \\vec{B} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_L$ is the London penetration depth.\n\nGiven the geometry of the problem, the magnetic field is directed along the z-axis and varies only with the x-coordinate: $\\vec{B} = B(x) \\hat{z}$. Substituting this into the London equation, the Laplacian simplifies to $\\nabla^2 \\vec{B} = \\frac{d^2 B(x)}{dx^2} \\hat{z}$. The vector equation thus reduces to a one-dimensional second-order ordinary differential equation for $B(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 B(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_L^2} B(x) = 0\n$$\n\nThe general solution to this homogeneous linear differential equation can be written as a linear combination of exponential functions, or more conveniently for this problem, hyperbolic functions:\n$$\nB(x) = C_1 \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_L}\\right) + C_2 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_L}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are determined by the external magnetic field $H_0$. At the surfaces of the slab ($x = \\pm d/2$), the tangential component of the magnetic field $\\vec{H}$ must be continuous. Since the external field is $\\vec{H}_{ext} = H_0 \\hat{z}$, the field just inside the surface is also $H_0 \\hat{z}$. In a superconductor described by London theory (for weak fields), the magnetic induction $\\vec{B}$ is related to $\\vec{H}$ by $\\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\vec{H}$. Therefore, the magnetic field at the boundaries is $B(\\pm d/2) = \\mu_0 H_0$.\n\nAlternatively, one can state that the tangential component of $\\vec{B}$ is continuous across the boundary in the absence of a surface current sheet. Outside the superconductor, $\\vec{B}_{ext} = \\mu_0 \\vec{H}_{ext} = \\mu_0 H_0 \\hat{z}$. Thus, the boundary conditions for $B(x)$ are:\n1. $B(x = d/2) = \\mu_0 H_0$\n2. $B(x = -d/2) = \\mu_0 H_0$\n\nThe problem is symmetric with respect to the center of the slab at $x=0$. The external field is symmetric, so the field distribution $B(x)$ must be an even function of $x$, i.e., $B(x) = B(-x)$. The function $\\cosh(x/\\lambda_L)$ is even, while $\\sinh(x/\\lambda_L)$ is odd. For $B(x)$ to be even, the coefficient of the odd part must be zero, so $C_2 = 0$.\n\nThe solution simplifies to:\n$$\nB(x) = C_1 \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_L}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we apply the first boundary condition at $x = d/2$ to find $C_1$:\n$$\nB(d/2) = C_1 \\cosh\\left(\\frac{d}{2\\lambda_L}\\right) = \\mu_0 H_0\n$$\nSolving for $C_1$:\n$$\nC_1 = \\frac{\\mu_0 H_0}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{d}{2\\lambda_L}\\right)}\n$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $B(x)$, we get the general solution for a slab of thickness $d$:\n$$\nB(x) = \\mu_0 H_0 \\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_L}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{d}{2\\lambda_L}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the specific case where $d = 4\\lambda_L$. We substitute this value into our general solution. The term in the denominator becomes:\n$$\n\\cosh\\left(\\frac{d}{2\\lambda_L}\\right) = \\cosh\\left(\\frac{4\\lambda_L}{2\\lambda_L}\\right) = \\cosh(2)\n$$\n\nTherefore, the final expression for the magnetic field distribution inside the slab is:\n$$\nB(x) = \\mu_0 H_0 \\frac{\\cosh(x/\\lambda_L)}{\\cosh(2)}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $-2\\lambda_L \\le x \\le 2\\lambda_L$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\mu_0 H_0 \\frac{\\cosh(x/\\lambda_L)}{\\cosh(2)}}\n$$", "id": "1131162"}, {"introduction": "While Type-I superconductors exhibit a complete Meissner effect up to a critical field, Type-II superconductors allow for partial magnetic field penetration in the form of quantized flux tubes, or Abrikosov vortices.
