Rewrite the Hamiltonian**\n\nThe Hamiltonian involves a sum over all pairs of spins. We can express this sum in terms of the total spin of the system, $\\mathbf{S}_{tot} = \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\mathbf{S}_i$.\nLet's compute the square of the total spin:\n$$ \\mathbf{S}_{tot}^2 = (\\mathbf{S}_1 + \\mathbf{S}_2 + \\mathbf{S}_3 + \\mathbf{S}_4) \\cdot (\\mathbf{S}_1 + \\mathbf{S}_2 + \\mathbf{S}_3 + \\mathbf{S}_4) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{S}_{tot}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^4 |\\mathbf{S}_i|^2 + 2 \\sum_{i<j} \\mathbf{S}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{S}_j $$\nSince the spins are classical vectors of fixed magnitude $S$, we have $|\\mathbf{S}_i|^2 = S^2$. The sum over pairs $\\sum_{i<j}$ is equivalent to the sum over nearest-neighbor pairs $\\sum_{\\langle i, j \\rangle}$ for a tetrahedron.\n$$ \\mathbf{S}_{tot}^2 = 4S^2 + 2 \\sum_{\\langle i, j \\rangle} \\mathbf{S}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{S}_j $$\nWe can now express the Hamiltonian in terms of $\\mathbf{S}_{tot}^2$:\n$$ \\sum_{\\langle i, j \\rangle} \\mathbf{S}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{S}_j = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{S}_{tot}^2 - 4S^2) $$\n$$ H = \\frac{J}{2} (\\mathbf{S}_{tot}^2 - 4S^2) $$\n\n**2. Find the Ground State Condition**\n\nTo find the ground state, we need to minimize the energy $H$. Since $J > 0$, this is equivalent to minimizing the term $\\mathbf{S}_{tot}^2$. The total spin squared, being the square of a vector's magnitude, is always non-negative: $\\mathbf{S}_{tot}^2 = |\\mathbf{S}_{tot}|^2 \\ge 0$.\nThe minimum possible value is $\\mathbf{S}_{tot}^2 = 0$, which occurs when the total spin vector is zero.\nTherefore, the condition for a configuration to be a ground state is:\n$$ \\mathbf{S}_{tot} = \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\mathbf{S}_i = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThe ground state energy is $E_{GS} = \\frac{J}{2} (0 - 4S^2) = -2JS^2$.\n\n**3. Determine the Dimension of the Ground State Manifold**\n\nThe ground states are the set of all spin configurations $\\{\\mathbf{S}_1, \\mathbf{S}_2, \\mathbf{S}_3, \\mathbf{S}_4\\}$ that satisfy two conditions:\n1. $|\\mathbf{S}_i| = S$ for each $i=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n2. $\\sum_{i=1}^4 \\mathbf{S}_i = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nWe determine the number of independent parameters (degrees of freedom) needed to specify such a configuration.\n- Each classical spin $\\mathbf{S}_i$ is a vector on the surface of a sphere of radius $S$. Its direction can be specified by two angles (e.g., polar and azimuthal angles). Thus, each spin has 2 degrees of freedom.\n- For four spins, the total number of degrees of freedom in an unconstrained system is $4 \\times 2 = 8$.\n- The ground state condition $\\sum_i \\mathbf{S}_i = \\mathbf{0}$ is a vector equation. It imposes three independent constraints, one for each Cartesian component (x, y, z) of the sum.\n- The dimension of the manifold of all ground states, $\\dim(M_{GS})$, is the total number of degrees of freedom minus the number of constraints:\n$$ \\dim(M_{GS}) = 8 - 3 = 5 $$\n\n**4. Account for Global Rotational Symmetry**\n\nThe Hamiltonian $H = J \\sum_{\\langle i, j \\rangle} \\mathbf{S}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{S}_j$ is invariant under a global rotation of all spins. If $\\{\\mathbf{S}_i\\}$ is a ground state, then $\\{R\\mathbf{S}_i\\}$, where $R$ is any SO(3) rotation matrix, is also a ground state with the same energy. These states are considered physically equivalent.\nThe problem asks for the number of parameters required to specify a ground state *excluding* global rotations. This corresponds to the dimension of the quotient manifold $M_{GS} / SO(3)$.\n- The group of global rotations, SO(3), is a continuous group described by 3 parameters (e.g., three Euler angles).\n- For a generic ground state configuration, the four spins are not all collinear or coplanar. In this case, the only rotation that leaves all four spins unchanged is the identity. Thus, the action of the rotation group is free on the manifold of generic ground states.\n- The dimension of the manifold of physically inequivalent ground states is the dimension of the total ground state manifold minus the dimension of the symmetry group:\n$$ \\dim(M_{GS} / SO(3)) = \\dim(M_{GS}) - \\dim(SO(3)) = 5 - 3 = 2 $$\n\nThus, the family of physically distinct classical ground states is parameterized by two continuous variables.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2} $$", "id": "1186144"}, {"introduction": "Alexei Kitaev's honeycomb model is a landmark achievement, offering a rare exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid with non-abelian anyonic excitations in certain parameter regimes.

The ground state must lie in one of these sectors.\n\nKitaev’s exact solution involves rewriting the spin operators in terms of Majorana fermions. This transforms the Hamiltonian into a model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the lattice, coupled to a static $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. The gauge field is defined by operators on the links, $u_{jk} = ib_j^{\\alpha_{jk}} b_k^{\\alpha_{jk}}$, which have eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. These are also conserved quantities. The plaquette flux $w_p$ is simply the product of the bond variables $u_{jk}$ around the plaquette: $W_p = \\prod_{\\langle j,k\\rangle\\in p} u_{jk}$.\n\nThe energy spectrum of the Majorana fermions depends on the flux configuration $\\{w_p\\}$. According to a theorem by Lieb, the ground state energy for this type of hopping problem on a bipartite lattice is always found in the sector with zero flux through every plaquette. This corresponds to the configuration where $w_p=+1$ for all $p$. This can also be shown explicitly by calculating and comparing the fermion band energies for different flux sectors.\n\nWhen the couplings $J_x, J_y, J_z$ are positive and satisfy the triangle inequalities, the overall ground state of the Kitaev model lies in this vortex-free sector where all plaquette fluxes are $+1$.
