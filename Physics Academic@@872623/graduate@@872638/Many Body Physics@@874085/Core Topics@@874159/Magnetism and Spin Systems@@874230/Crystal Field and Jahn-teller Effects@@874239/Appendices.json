Do not round.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the octahedral crystal-field (CF) splitting, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{CF}}$, arising from covalent hybridization between a central transition-metal ion's $d$ orbitals and the surrounding six ligands' $p$ orbitals. We are to use second-order perturbation theory in the limit where the energy separation between the metal $d$ and ligand $p$ states, $\\Delta_{dp} = \\epsilon_{d} - \\epsilon_{p}$, is large compared to the hopping integrals.\n\nThe unperturbed Hamiltonian, $H_{0}$, describes the system with no interaction between the metal and the ligands. Its eigenstates are the five metal $d$ orbitals, all with energy $\\epsilon_{d}$, and the $6 \\times 3 = 18$ ligand $p$ orbitals, all with energy $\\epsilon_{p}$. The perturbation, $H'$, is the Hamiltonian term that describes the covalent hopping (hybridization) between the metal $d$ orbitals and the ligand $p$ orbitals.\n\nAccording to second-order perturbation theory, the energy shift $\\Delta E_{i}^{(2)}$ for a specific metal $d$ orbital $|d_{i}\\rangle$ is given by:\n$$ \\Delta E_{d_{i}}^{(2)} = \\sum_{j} \\frac{|\\langle\\psi_{p,j}| H' |d_{i}\\rangle|^2}{E_{d}^{(0)} - E_{p}^{(0)}} $$\nwhere the sum runs over all $18$ unperturbed ligand $p$ orbitals, which we denote collectively as $|\\psi_{p,j}\\rangle$. The unperturbed energies are $E_{d}^{(0)} = \\epsilon_{d}$ and $E_{p}^{(0)} = \\epsilon_{p}$. The denominator is therefore the given energy separation, $\\Delta_{dp} = \\epsilon_{d} - \\epsilon_{p}$. The formula becomes:\n$$ \\Delta E_{d_{i}}^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta_{dp}} \\sum_{j=1}^{18} |\\langle\\psi_{p,j}| H' |d_{i}\\rangle|^2 $$\nThe matrix elements $\\langle\\psi_{p,j}| H' |d_{i}\\rangle$ are the hopping integrals, which are parameterized using the Slater-Koster (SK) two-center integral scheme. We are given the parameters $V_{pd\\sigma}$ and $V_{pd\\pi}$.\n\nIn the octahedral ($O_{h}$) symmetry of the crystal field, the five degenerate $d$ orbitals of the free ion split into two sets corresponding to two irreducible representations of the $O_h$ group:\n1.  The $e_{g}$ orbitals: $\\{d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}, d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\\}$, which are doubly degenerate.\n2.  The $t_{2g}$ orbitals: $\\{d_{xy}, d_{yz}, d_{zx}\\}$, which are triply degenerate.\n\nBy symmetry, all orbitals within a given irreducible representation must have the same energy. Therefore, we only need to calculate the energy shift for one representative orbital from each set.\n\nThe hopping integrals depend on the orientation of the bond axis relative to the orbitals. We analyze the interactions with the six ligands located at $(\\pm a, 0, 0)$, $(0, \\pm a, 0)$, and $(0, 0, \\pm a)$. It is most convenient to evaluate the SK integrals by considering the local symmetry of each metal-ligand bond. For a bond oriented along the $z$-axis, orbitals are classified by their angular momentum projection onto this axis ($\\sigma, \\pi, \\delta, \\dots$). The non-zero hopping integrals are only between orbitals of the same symmetry type. For a metal $d$ orbital and a ligand $p$ orbital, the non-zero interactions are:\n-   $\\langle d_{3z^2-r^2}| H' |p_z \\rangle = V_{pd\\sigma}$ ($\\sigma$-type interaction)\n-   $\\langle d_{zx}| H' |p_x \\rangle = V_{pd\\pi}$ ($\\pi$-type interaction)\n-   $\\langle d_{yz}| H' |p_y \\rangle = V_{pd\\pi}$ ($\\pi$-type interaction)\nAll other $d$-$p$ interactions for a bond along the $z$-axis are zero by symmetry.\n\n**Energy Shift of the $e_{g}$ levels**\n\nLet us calculate the shift for the $|d_{x^2-y^2}\\rangle$ orbital. We sum the squared hopping integrals over all six ligands.\n\n1.  **Ligands on the $z$-axis ($0, 0, \\pm a$):** The bond axis is $z$. The $|d_{x^2-y^2}\\rangle$ orbital has $\\delta$ symmetry with respect to this axis. Since the ligand $p$ orbitals can only have $\\sigma$ or $\\pi$ symmetry, the overlap integrals are zero.\n    $$ \\sum_{L_z, i} |\\langle \\psi_{p,i}@L_z | H' | d_{x^2-y^2} \\rangle|^2 = 0 $$\n\n2.  **Ligands on the $x$-axis ($\\pm a, 0, 0$):** We can find the interaction by rotating the coordinate system so the bond axis is along $z'$, where $z'=x$. The interaction is then between $|d_{x^2-y^2}\\rangle$ and the $p$ orbitals on these ligands. The $|d_{x^2-y^2}\\rangle$ orbital has lobes pointing along the $x$ and $y$ axes, participating in $\\sigma$-type bonding with ligands on these axes.

The energy shift for the $e_g$ levels is:\n$$ \\Delta E_{e_g} = \\frac{3V_{pd\\sigma}^2}{\\Delta_{dp}} $$\nThe energy of the $e_g$ orbitals is raised, which is characteristic of antibonding orbitals.\n\n**Energy Shift of the $t_{2g}$ levels**\n\nLet us calculate the shift for the $|d_{xy}\\rangle$ orbital.\n\n1.  **Ligands on the $z$-axis ($0, 0, \\pm a$):** The bond axis is $z$. The $|d_{xy}\\rangle$ orbital has $\\delta$ symmetry with respect to this axis, so it does not interact with any of the ligand $p$ orbitals. The contribution is zero.\n\n2.  **Ligands on the $x$-axis ($\\pm a, 0, 0$):** The bond axis is $x$. The $|d_{xy}\\rangle$ orbital lobes are between the $x$ and $y$ axes. This orbital forms a $\\pi$-bond with the ligand $p_y$ orbital. Using the SK rules or symmetry considerations:\n    $$ |\\langle p_y @ (\\pm a,0,0) | H' | d_{xy} \\rangle|^2 = V_{pd\\pi}^2 $$\n    The interaction with $p_x$ and $p_z$ orbitals is zero by symmetry. The total contribution from the two ligands on the $x$-axis is $2 \\times V_{pd\\pi}^2$.\n\n3.  **Ligands on the $y$-axis ($0, \\pm a, 0$):** The bond axis is $y$. By symmetry with the previous case (swapping $x$ and $y$), the $|d_{xy}\\rangle$ orbital forms a $\\pi$-bond with the ligand $p_x$ orbital.\n    $$ |\\langle p_x @ (0,\\pm a,0) | H' | d_{xy} \\rangle|^2 = V_{pd\\pi}^2 $$\n    The total contribution from the two ligands on the $y$-axis is $2 \\times V_{pd\\pi}^2$.\n\nThe total sum of squared matrix elements for $|d_{xy}\\rangle$ is $0 + 2V_{pd\\pi}^2 + 2V_{pd\\pi}^2 = 4V_{pd\\pi}^2$. The energy shift for the $t_{2g}$ levels is:\n$$ \\Delta E_{t_{2g}} = \\frac{4V_{pd\\pi}^2}{\\Delta_{dp}} $$\nThe energy of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals is also raised, corresponding to antibonding states.\n\n**Octahedral Crystal-Field (CF) Splitting**\n\nThe crystal-field splitting is defined as $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{CF}} \\equiv E(e_g) - E(t_{2g})$. The new energies are $E(e_g) = \\epsilon_d + \\Delta E_{e_g}$ and $E(t_{2g}) = \\epsilon_d + \\Delta E_{t_{2g}}$.\n$$ \\Delta_{\\mathrm{CF}} = (\\epsilon_d + \\Delta E_{e_g}) - (\\epsilon_d + \\Delta E_{t_{2g}}) = \\Delta E_{e_g} - \\Delta E_{t_{2g}} $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for the energy shifts:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\mathrm{CF}} = \\frac{3V_{pd\\sigma}^2}{\\Delta_{dp}} - \\frac{4V_{pd\\pi}^2}{\\Delta_{dp}} = \\frac{3V_{pd\\sigma}^2 - 4V_{pd\\pi}^2}{\\Delta_{dp}} $$\nThe problem requests definitions for Slater-Koster (SK), crystal field (CF), and Jahn-Teller (JT). SK refers to a method for parameterizing hopping integrals in a tight-binding model based on orbital overlaps and bond geometry. CF refers to the splitting of electronic states (typically $d$ or $f$ orbitals) of an ion due to the electrostatic field created by neighboring ions or ligands.

The lattice elastic energy is $(k/2) Q_3^2$ with force constant $k$. Include electronic correlations via a simplified density-density interaction energy that captures two fundamental contributions: an intra-orbital Hubbard repulsion $U$ penalizing each doubly-occupied orbital, and a Hund’s exchange $J$ that lowers the energy by $J$ for each pair of parallel spins in different orbitals. Work under constrained occupations representing the two competing spin states:\n- The high-spin configuration $t_{2g}^3 e_g^1$ with total spin $S=2$, having four electrons with parallel spins occupying four distinct orbitals.\n- The low-spin configuration $t_{2g}^4 e_g^0$ with total spin $S=1$, having one doubly occupied $t_{2g}$ orbital and three $t_{2g}$ orbitals containing up spins across three distinct orbitals.\n\nUsing these definitions, and treating $Q_3$ as a classical coordinate, perform the following tasks for each parameter set in the test suite:\n1. Starting from the above crystal-field energies, linear vibronic coupling, and the simplified interaction model, write down the total energy for the high-spin and low-spin states as functions of $Q_3$. The total energy must include the single-particle crystal-field contributions, the Jahn-Teller coupling to $Q_3$, the lattice elastic energy, and the interaction energy contributions from $U$ and $J$ based on the specified occupancy constraints.\n2. Minimize the total energy with respect to $Q_3$ for each spin state to obtain the equilibrium distortion $Q_3^\\ast$ and the corresponding minimized total energy. For the low-spin state, note that there is no $e_g$ occupancy, and thus no linear Jahn-Teller coupling to $Q_3$; the equilibrium distortion is determined solely by the elastic energy and crystal-field contributions under the given constraints.\n3.

The Jahn-Teller distortion splits the $e_g$ doublet into two levels at energies $+3\\Delta/5 \\mp gQ_3$. The single $e_g$ electron will occupy the lower-energy level to achieve stabilization.

You will apply first-order degenerate perturbation theory and learn the elegant isomorphism that maps the orbital angular momentum operator $\\mathbf{L}$ to an effective operator with $L'=1$ within the $t_{2g}$ subspace.", "problem": "A transition-metal ion with one electron in the $d$ shell is placed in a perfect octahedral crystal field. The octahedral crystal field splits the fivefold orbital degeneracy into a lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbital triplet and a higher-energy $e_g$ orbital doublet, with a separation $\\Delta_{\\text{oct}}$ that is large compared to the spin-orbit coupling energy scale. Consequently, the ground state term is the orbital triplet $^2T_{2g}$, arising from one electron occupying the $t_{2g}$ manifold with spin $s=\\frac{1}{2}$.

Then compute the energy separation $\\Delta E$ between the upper and lower spin-orbit split levels as a function of $\\lambda$.\n\nFinally, evaluate the magnitude of this separation for $\\lambda=100~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Express your final numerical answer in $\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and round your result to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard textbook case of spin-orbit coupling acting on the ground term of a $d^1$ transition-metal ion in an octahedral crystal field. All given information is consistent and sufficient to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the energy splitting of the $^2T_{2g}$ ground term of a $d^1$ ion due to spin-orbit coupling, treated as a perturbation. The unperturbed ground state is six-fold degenerate, comprising a three-fold orbital degeneracy ($t_{2g}$) and a two-fold spin degeneracy ($s=1/2$). The basis for this six-dimensional subspace can be written as the set of states $\\{|\\phi_i, m_s\\rangle\\}$, where $\\phi_i$ are the three real $d$ orbitals of $t_{2g}$ symmetry, namely $|d_{xy}\\rangle$, $|d_{yz}\\rangle$, and $|d_{xz}\\rangle$, and $m_s = \\pm 1/2$ are the spin projection quantum numbers.\n\nThe perturbation is the spin-orbit coupling Hamiltonian, $H_{\\text{SO}} = \\lambda\\,\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{S}$, where $\\lambda$ is the spin-orbit coupling constant, $\\mathbf{L}$ is the orbital angular momentum operator, and $\\mathbf{S}$ is the spin angular momentum operator. We are instructed to use first-order degenerate perturbation theory, which involves diagonalizing the $6 \\times 6$ matrix of $H_{\\text{SO}}$ within the degenerate ground state subspace.\n\nA direct calculation of the matrix elements $\\langle \\phi_i, m_s | \\lambda\\,\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{S} | \\phi_j, m'_s \\rangle$ is possible but tedious. A more elegant and physically insightful method involves recognizing the isomorphism between the action of the orbital angular momentum operator $\\mathbf{L}$ within the $t_{2g}$ subspace and the action of an effective angular momentum operator $\\mathbf{L}'$ corresponding to a quantum number $L'=1$.\n\nWithin the subspace spanned by the $t_{2g}$ orbitals, the matrix representations of the components of $\\mathbf{L}$ can be shown to be equivalent to those of $-\\mathbf{L}'$, where $\\mathbf{L}'$ is the angular momentum operator for a $p$-shell ($L'=1$). Thus, for the purpose of calculating matrix elements within the $t_{2g}$ manifold, we can make the substitution $\\mathbf{L} \\rightarrow -\\mathbf{L}'$. The spin-orbit Hamiltonian, when projected onto the $^2T_{2g}$ manifold, becomes an effective Hamiltonian:\n$$H'_{\\text{SO}} = \\lambda (-\\mathbf{L}')\\cdot\\mathbf{S} = -\\lambda \\mathbf{L}'\\cdot\\mathbf{S}$$\nThe problem now reduces to the standard case of coupling an effective orbital angular momentum $L'=1$ with a spin angular momentum $S=1/2$. We define a total effective angular momentum operator $\\mathbf{J}' = \\mathbf{L}' + \\mathbf{S}$. According to the rules of angular momentum addition, the possible values for the total effective angular momentum quantum number $J'$ are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series:\n$$J' = |L' - S|, \\dots, L' + S = |1 - 1/2|, \\dots, 1+1/2$$\nThis gives two possible values: $J' = 1/2$ and $J' = 3/2$. The original six-fold degenerate $^2T_{2g}$ term therefore splits into two multiplets. The degeneracy of each multiplet is given by $2J'+1$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $J' = 3/2$, the degeneracy is $2(3/2) + 1 = 4$.\n    \\item For $J' = 1/2$, the degeneracy is $2(1/2) + 1 = 2$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe total degeneracy is $4+2=6$, as expected.\n\nTo find the energy eigenvalues, we use the vector model identity: $\\mathbf{J}'^2 = (\\mathbf{L}'+\\mathbf{S})^2 = \\mathbf{L}'^2 + \\mathbf{S}^2 + 2\\mathbf{L}'\\cdot\\mathbf{S}$. From this, we can express the operator $\\mathbf{L}'\\cdot\\mathbf{S}$ as:\n$$\\mathbf{L}'\\cdot\\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{J}'^2 - \\mathbf{L}'^2 - \\mathbf{S}^2)$$\nThe eigenvalues of this operator, in a basis of states diagonal in $J'$, $L'$, and $S$, are given by (setting $\\hbar=1$):\n$$E_{L'S J'} = \\frac{1}{2}[J'(J'+1) - L'(L'+1) - S(S+1)]$$\nWe can now calculate this value for each of the two multiplets, using $L'=1$ and $S=1/2$.\n\nFor the $J' = 3/2$ multiplet:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{L}'\\cdot\\mathbf{S} \\rangle_{J'=3/2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}+1\\right) - 1(1+1) - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right)\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{15}{4} - 2 - \\frac{3}{4}\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{12}{4} - 2\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}[3-2] = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe energy of this level is $E_{3/2} = -\\lambda \\langle \\mathbf{L}'\\cdot\\mathbf{S} \\rangle_{J'=3/2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda$.\n\nFor the $J' = 1/2$ multiplet:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{L}'\\cdot\\mathbf{S} \\rangle_{J'=1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right) - 1(1+1) - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right)\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{3}{4} - 2 - \\frac{3}{4}\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}[-2] = -1 $$\nThe energy of this level is $E_{1/2} = -\\lambda \\langle \\mathbf{L}'\\cdot\\mathbf{S} \\rangle_{J'=1/2} = -\\lambda(-1) = \\lambda$.\n\nFor a $d^1$ configuration, which is a less than half-filled shell, the spin-orbit coupling constant $\\lambda$ is positive. Therefore, the $J'=3/2$ multiplet with energy $E_{3/2} = -\\lambda/2$ is the ground level, and the $J'=1/2$ multiplet with energy $E_{1/2} = \\lambda$ is the excited level.\n\nThe energy separation $\\Delta E$ between the upper and lower spin-orbit split levels is:\n$$ \\Delta E = E_{1/2} - E_{3/2} = \\lambda - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}\\lambda $$\nThe problem asks to evaluate the magnitude of this separation for $\\lambda = 100~\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n$$ |\\Delta E| = \\left|\\frac{3}{2} \\times 100~\\text{cm}^{-1}\\right| = 150~\\text{cm}^{-1} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $1.50 \\times 10^2~\\text{cm}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.50 \\times 10^{2}}$$", "id": "2979027"}]}
