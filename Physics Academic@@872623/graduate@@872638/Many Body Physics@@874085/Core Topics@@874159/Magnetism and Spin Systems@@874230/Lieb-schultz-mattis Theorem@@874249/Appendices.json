This can occur when a system avoids a gapless spectrum by spontaneously breaking a symmetry and developing a degenerate set of gapped ground states. This practice problem explores such a scenario in a dimerized spin-1/2 chain, where a topological defect—a domain wall between the two degenerate ground state patterns—emerges as the elementary excitation. By analyzing this defect in a solvable limit, you will discover that it carries a fractionalized spin-1/2, a classic example of spinon deconfinement [@problem_id:1165114].", "problem": "The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem and its generalizations have profound consequences for one-dimensional quantum spin systems. One such consequence is the possibility of fractionalized excitations in systems with gapped, degenerate ground states.\n\nConsider a one-dimensional chain of spin-1/2 particles described by the Heisenberg model. If the exchange couplings are uniform, the system is gapless. However, the system can develop a gap by spontaneously breaking translation symmetry via dimerization, a phenomenon known as the spin-Peierls transition. This leads to two degenerate ground states, characterized by two distinct dimerization patterns. Let's model these patterns by an explicitly dimerized Hamiltonian on an infinite chain of sites indexed by integers $i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe two patterns, A and B, are defined by which bonds are strong ($J_S$) and which are weak ($J_W$).\n- **Pattern A**: Strong bonds connect sites $(2i-1, 2i)$ and weak bonds connect sites $(2i, 2i+1)$.\n- **Pattern B**: Strong bonds connect sites $(2i, 2i+1)$ and weak bonds connect sites $(2i-1, 2i)$.\n\nA domain wall is a topological excitation that separates a semi-infinite region of one pattern from a semi-infinite region of the other. We are interested in the quantum numbers of this excitation. To simplify the analysis, we consider the extreme dimerization limit where the strong coupling is $J>0$ and the weak coupling is zero.\n\nThe domain wall is centered between site $0$ and site $1$. The couplings are set as follows:\n- For sites $i \\le 0$, the dimerization follows Pattern A.\n- For sites $i \\ge 1$, the dimerization follows Pattern B.\n\nExplicitly, the Hamiltonian for the chain with a domain wall is:\n$$ H_{DW} = J \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{0} \\vec{S}_{2k-1} \\cdot \\vec{S}_{2k} + J \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\vec{S}_{2k} \\cdot \\vec{S}_{2k+1} $$\nwhere $\\vec{S}_i$ are the spin-1/2 operators at site $i$ and $J>0$. The ground state of this Hamiltonian is degenerate due to the presence of the domain wall. This degenerate multiplet carries a definite total spin, $S$.\n\nCalculate the value of the total spin projection, $S^z_{total} = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} S_i^z$, for the ground state of $H_{DW}$ in which the domain wall's intrinsic spin is maximally aligned with the positive z-axis. The spin operators are dimensionless (in units of $\\hbar$).", "solution": "The problem asks for the total spin projection $S^z_{total}$ of a specific ground state of the given Hamiltonian $H_{DW}$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$ H_{DW} = J \\left( \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{0} \\vec{S}_{2k-1} \\cdot \\vec{S}_{2k} + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\vec{S}_{2k} \\cdot \\vec{S}_{2k+1} \\right) $$\n\nLet's analyze the structure of this Hamiltonian. It is a sum of terms, where each term involves a pair of spins. Crucially, all the spin operators in any given term commute with all spin operators in any other term, because they act on different sites. For example, the term $\\vec{S}_{-1} \\cdot \\vec{S}_{0}$ (for $k=0$) commutes with the term $\\vec{S}_{-3} \\cdot \\vec{S}_{-2}$ (for $k=-1$) and also with $\\vec{S}_{2} \\cdot \\vec{S}_{3}$ (for $k=1$).\nThis means that $H_{DW}$ is a sum of commuting operators:\n$$ H_{DW} = \\sum_{\\alpha} H_\\alpha, \\quad [H_\\alpha, H_\\beta] = 0 \\quad \\forall \\alpha, \\beta $$\nwhere each $H_\\alpha$ corresponds to a single term $\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j$.\n\nThe ground state of such a Hamiltonian is the product of the ground states of each individual term $H_\\alpha$.\nLet's find the ground state of a single term $H_{ij} = J \\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j$. The total spin of the pair is $\\vec{S}_{ij} = \\vec{S}_i + \\vec{S}_j$. Then $\\vec{S}_{ij}^2 = \\vec{S}_i^2 + \\vec{S}_j^2 + 2\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j$.\nSince we are dealing with spin-1/2 particles, $S_i^2 = s(s+1) = (1/2)(3/2) = 3/4$.\nSo, $\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j = \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{S}_{ij}^2 - \\vec{S}_i^2 - \\vec{S}_j^2) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{S}_{ij}^2 - 3/2)$.\nThe total spin quantum number $S_{ij}$ can be $0$ (singlet) or $1$ (triplet).\n- For the singlet state, $S_{ij}=0$, so $\\vec{S}_{ij}^2 = 0$. The energy is $E_s = J(0 - 3/2)/2 = -3J/4$.\n- For the triplet state, $S_{ij}=1$, so $\\vec{S}_{ij}^2 = 1(2)=2$. The energy is $E_t = J(2 - 3/2)/2 = +J/4$.\n\nSince $J>0$, the ground state for each pair of interacting spins $(i,j)$ is the singlet state, denoted $|s\\rangle_{i,j}$. The singlet state is given by $|s\\rangle_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|\\uparrow_i \\downarrow_j\\rangle - |\\downarrow_i \\uparrow_j\\rangle)$, and it has a total spin projection of zero, i.e., $(S_i^z + S_j^z)|s\\rangle_{i,j}=0$.\n\nNow we must identify which sites are involved in the Hamiltonian terms.\nThe first sum, $\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{0} \\vec{S}_{2k-1} \\cdot \\vec{S}_{2k}$, includes pairs of sites:\n- $k=0: (-1, 0)$\n- $k=-1: (-3, -2)$\n- $k=-2: (-5, -4)$\nAnd so on. This sum covers all negative integers and zero.\n\nThe second sum, $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\vec{S}_{2k} \\cdot \\vec{S}_{2k+1}$, includes pairs of sites:\n- $k=1: (2, 3)$\n- $k=2: (4, 5)$\nAnd so on. This sum covers all positive integers from 2 upwards.\n\nLet's list all integer sites: $\\mathbb{Z} = \\{ ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... \\}$.\nThe sites covered by the Hamiltonian are $\\{..., -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0\\} \\cup \\{2, 3, 4, 5, ...\\}$.\nThe site $i=1$ does not appear in any term of the Hamiltonian. This means the spin at site 1 does not interact with any other spin. It is a free spin.\n\nThe ground state of $H_{DW}$ is therefore a product state where all interacting pairs are in their singlet ground states, and the free spin at site 1 can be in any state.\nLet $|\\Psi_{GS}\\rangle$ be a ground state. It must be of the form:\n$$ |\\Psi_{GS}\\rangle = \\left(\\bigotimes_{k=-\\infty}^{0} |s\\rangle_{2k-1, 2k}\\right) \\otimes |\\chi\\rangle_1 \\otimes \\left(\\bigotimes_{k=1}^{\\infty} |s\\rangle_{2k, 2k+1}\\right) $$\nwhere $|\\chi\\rangle_1$ is the state of the spin at site 1. Since spin 1 is a spin-1/2, its state space is spanned by $|\\uparrow\\rangle_1$ and $|\\downarrow\\rangle_1$.\nThis means the ground state is a two-fold degenerate spin doublet, with total spin $S=1/2$. The two basis states for this ground-state manifold are:\n$$ |\\Psi_{\\uparrow}\\rangle = \\left(\\dots\\right) \\otimes |\\uparrow\\rangle_1 \\otimes \\left(\\dots\\right) $$\n$$ |\\Psi_{\\downarrow}\\rangle = \\left(\\dots\\right) \\otimes |\\downarrow\\rangle_1 \\otimes \\left(\\dots\\right) $$\nThe problem asks for the total spin projection $S^z_{total}$ for the ground state where the domain wall's intrinsic spin is maximally aligned with the positive z-axis. This corresponds to the state $|\\Psi_{\\uparrow}\\rangle$.\n\nLet's calculate $S^z_{total} = \\langle \\Psi_{\\uparrow} | \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} S_i^z | \\Psi_{\\uparrow} \\rangle$.\n$$ S^z_{total} = \\left\\langle \\left(\\bigotimes_{k=-\\infty}^{0} |s\\rangle_{2k-1, 2k}\\right) \\otimes |\\uparrow\\rangle_1 \\otimes \\left(\\bigotimes_{k=1}^{\\infty} |s\\rangle_{2k, 2k+1}\\right) \\left| \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} S_i^z \\right| \\left(\\bigotimes_{k'=-\\infty}^{0} |s\\rangle_{2k'-1, 2k'}\\right) \\otimes |\\uparrow\\rangle_1 \\otimes \\left(\\bigotimes_{k'=1}^{\\infty} |s\\rangle_{2k', 2k'+1}\\right) \\right\\rangle $$\nDue to orthogonality, the expectation value of a sum is the sum of expectation values. We can split the sum over sites $i$ into three parts: the paired sites in the left domain, the unpaired site 1, and the paired sites in the right domain.\n$$ S^z_{total} = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{0} \\langle s_{2k-1, 2k} | S_{2k-1}^z + S_{2k}^z | s_{2k-1, 2k} \\rangle + \\langle \\uparrow_1 | S_1^z | \\uparrow_1 \\rangle + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\langle s_{2k, 2k+1} | S_{2k}^z + S_{2k+1}^z | s_{2k, 2k+1} \\rangle $$\nFor any singlet state $|s\\rangle_{i,j}$, the expectation value of the local spin projection is zero: $\\langle s_{i,j} | S_i^z + S_j^z | s_{i,j} \\rangle = 0$.\nTherefore, all terms from the paired spins are zero.\nThe only non-zero contribution comes from the free spin at site 1. The expectation value of $S_1^z$ in the state $|\\uparrow\\rangle_1$ is:\n$$ \\langle \\uparrow_1 | S_1^z | \\uparrow_1 \\rangle = +1/2 $$\nThus, the total spin projection is:\n$$ S^z_{total} = 0 + 1/2 + 0 = 1/2 $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}} $$", "id": "1165114"}]}
