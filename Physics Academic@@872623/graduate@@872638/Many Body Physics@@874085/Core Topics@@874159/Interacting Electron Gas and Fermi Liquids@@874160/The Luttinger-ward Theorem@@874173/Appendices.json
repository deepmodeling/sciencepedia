We are instructed to use the fact that the Luttinger-Ward functional evaluated at the exact Green's function gives the true grand potential $\\Omega$. The ground-state energy is then given by $E_g = \\Omega + \\mu N$.\n\n**1. Define the Grand Canonical System and Half-Filling Condition**\n\nThe grand canonical Hamiltonian is $K = H_0 - \\mu N$. The Hubbard atom Hamiltonian is $H_0 = \\epsilon(n_\\uparrow + n_\\downarrow) + U n_\\uparrow n_\\downarrow$. The particle number operator is $N = n_\\uparrow + n_\\downarrow$.\nThe Hilbert space of the Hubbard atom is spanned by four states:\n-   $|0\\rangle$ (empty state): $N=0$.\n-   $|\\uparrow\\rangle$ and $|\\downarrow\\rangle$ (singly occupied states): $N=1$.\n-   $|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle$ (doubly occupied state): $N=2$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $H_0$ for these states are:\n-   $H_0|0\\rangle = 0 |0\\rangle \\implies E_{H_0}(0) = 0$.\n-   $H_0|\\sigma\\rangle = \\epsilon |\\sigma\\rangle \\implies E_{H_0}(1) = \\epsilon$.\n-   $H_0|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle = (2\\epsilon+U) |\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle \\implies E_{H_0}(2) = 2\\epsilon+U$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the grand canonical Hamiltonian $K = H_0 - \\mu N$ are:\n-   For $|0\\rangle$: $E_K(0) = E_{H_0}(0) - \\mu(0) = 0$.\n-   For $|\\sigma\\rangle$: $E_K(1) = E_{H_0}(1) - \\mu(1) = \\epsilon - \\mu$.\n-   For $|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle$: $E_K(2) = E_{H_0}(2) - \\mu(2) = 2\\epsilon+U - 2\\mu$.\n\nThe half-filling condition corresponds to an average particle number of $\\langle N \\rangle = 1$. This is typically achieved by setting the chemical potential such that the energy to add a particle to a singly occupied site is the same as the energy to remove a particle. For the Hubbard atom, this means $\\mu = \\epsilon + U/2$.\n\nLet's substitute this value of $\\mu$ into the eigenvalues of $K$:\n-   $E_K(0) = 0$.\n-   $E_K(1) = \\epsilon - (\\epsilon + U/2) = -U/2$.\n-   $E_K(2) = 2\\epsilon+U - 2(\\epsilon + U/2) = 2\\epsilon+U - 2\\epsilon - U = 0$.\n\n**2. Determine the Grand Potential $\\Omega$**\n\nAt zero temperature, the system occupies the ground state of the grand canonical Hamiltonian $K$. The grand potential $\\Omega$ is defined as the minimum eigenvalue of $K$.\nThe eigenvalues of $K$ are $\\{0, -U/2, 0\\}$. Assuming $U > 0$, the minimum energy is $-U/2$.\nTherefore, the grand potential at $T=0$ and half-filling is:\n$$ \\Omega = -\\frac{U}{2} $$\nAccording to the problem statement, this is the value of the Luttinger-Ward functional evaluated with the exact Green's function.\n\n**3. Determine the Average Particle Number $N$**\n\nThe ground state of $K$ at half-filling is degenerate, spanned by the two singly-occupied states $|\\uparrow\\rangle$ and $|\\downarrow\\rangle$. To correctly calculate expectation values in the ground state, we must consider this degeneracy. The ground state density matrix at $T=0$ is an equal-weight mixture of the degenerate ground states. For a non-magnetic state, this is:\n$$ \\rho_g = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( |\\uparrow\\rangle\\langle\\uparrow| + |\\downarrow\\rangle\\langle\\downarrow| \\right) $$\nThe average particle number $N$ is the expectation value of the number operator $N=n_\\uparrow+n_\\downarrow$ in this ground state.\n$$ N = \\langle N \\rangle = \\text{Tr}(\\rho_g N) = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle\\uparrow| n_\\uparrow+n_\\downarrow |\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{1}{2} \\langle\\downarrow| n_\\uparrow+n_\\downarrow |\\downarrow\\rangle $$\nFor the state $|\\uparrow\\rangle$, $n_\\uparrow=1$ and $n_\\downarrow=0$, so $N=1$.\nFor the state $|\\downarrow\\rangle$, $n_\\uparrow=0$ and $n_\\downarrow=1$, so $N=1$.\n$$ N = \\frac{1}{2}(1) + \\frac{1}{2}(1) = 1 $$\nThis confirms that our choice of $\\mu$ correctly enforces the half-filling condition, $\\langle N \\rangle=1$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Ground-State Energy $E_g$**\n\nThe ground-state energy of the original Hamiltonian $H_0$ is given by the relation $E_g = \\Omega + \\mu N$.\nSubstituting the values we found:\n-   $\\Omega = -U/2$\n-   $\\mu = \\epsilon + U/2$\n-   $N = 1$\n\nWe get:\n$$ E_g = \\left(-\\frac{U}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\epsilon + \\frac{U}{2}\\right) \\times 1 $$\n$$ E_g = -\\frac{U}{2} + \\epsilon + \\frac{U}{2} $$\n$$ E_g = \\epsilon $$\nThis result can be verified by calculating the expectation value of $H_0$ in the grand canonical ground state:\n$$ E_g = \\langle H_0 \\rangle = \\text{Tr}(\\rho_g H_0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle\\uparrow| H_0 |\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{1}{2} \\langle\\downarrow| H_0 |\\downarrow\\rangle $$\nFrom above, $H_0|\\sigma\\rangle = \\epsilon|\\sigma\\rangle$. So,\n$$ E_g = \\frac{1}{2}(\\epsilon) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\epsilon) = \\epsilon $$\nThe results are consistent.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\epsilon} $$", "id": "1206590"}, {"introduction": "While the exact Luttinger-Ward functional is unknown for most systems, its true utility lies in its ability to generate systematic and thermodynamically consistent approximations.
