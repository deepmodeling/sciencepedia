Correlation Function in Fourier Space**\n\nThe two-point correlation function $G(x-y)$ is given by the thermal average $\\langle \\phi(x) \\phi(y) \\rangle$. Its Fourier transform, $\\tilde{G}(k)$, is related to the fluctuations of the Fourier modes $\\tilde{\\phi}(k)$.\n$$ \\tilde{G}(k) = \\langle \\tilde{\\phi}(k) \\tilde{\\phi}(-k) \\rangle = \\langle |\\tilde{\\phi}(k)|^2 \\rangle $$\nThe statistical weight for any field configuration is given by the Boltzmann factor $e^{-F[\\phi]}$. Since the free energy is quadratic in the fields, the probability distribution for each mode $\\tilde{\\phi}(k)$ is a Gaussian. For a quadratic variable, the average value can be found from the equipartition theorem or by direct calculation of the Gaussian integral. The result is that the variance is inversely proportional to the coefficient of the quadratic term.\n$$ \\langle |\\tilde{\\phi}(k)|^2 \\rangle \\propto \\frac{1}{k^2 + r} $$\nWe can set the constant of proportionality to one by appropriately normalizing the field $\\phi$.

Real-Space Correlation Function and Correlation Length**\n\nTo find the real-space correlation function $G(R)$, we perform an inverse Fourier transform of $\\tilde{G}(k)$:\n$$ G(R) = \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d} e^{i k \\cdot R} \\tilde{G}(k) = \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{e^{i k \\cdot R}}{k^2 + r} $$\nWe are interested in the behavior of $G(R)$ for large $R$. This behavior is determined by the poles of the integrand in the complex momentum plane. The denominator $k^2+r$ is zero when $k^2 = -r$. For $r>0$, this gives poles at purely imaginary momenta, $|k| = i\\sqrt{r}$.\n\nThe integral can be evaluated using contour integration. For example, in $d=3$, the result is the Yukawa potential:\n$$ G(R) = \\frac{e^{-R\\sqrt{r}}}{4\\pi R} $$\nFor a general dimension $d$, the integral evaluates to a function whose dominant long-distance behavior is determined by the pole closest to the real axis, which is at $|k|=i\\sqrt{r}$.

Comparing this with our calculated result, $G(R) \\sim e^{-R\\sqrt{r}}$, we can identify the correlation length:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\xi} = \\sqrt{r} $$\nThis gives the correlation length as a function of the parameter $r$:\n$$ \\xi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r}} = r^{-1/2} $$\nThe critical exponent $\\nu$ is defined by the power-law divergence of the correlation length as the system approaches the critical point ($r \\to 0$):\n$$ \\xi \\sim r^{-\\nu} $$\nBy comparing the two expressions for $\\xi$, we can directly read off the value of the exponent $\\nu$.\n$$ r^{-1/2} \\sim r^{-\\nu} \\implies \\nu = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe value of the correlation length exponent for the Gaussian model is $1/2$, independent of the spatial dimension $d$.
