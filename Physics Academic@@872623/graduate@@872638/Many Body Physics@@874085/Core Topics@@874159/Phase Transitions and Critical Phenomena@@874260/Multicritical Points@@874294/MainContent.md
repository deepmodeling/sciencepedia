## Introduction
In the study of phase transitions, [critical points](@entry_id:144653) mark singular moments of collective behavior. While a simple critical point is accessed by tuning a single parameter like temperature, the phase diagrams of many real-world systems are far more complex, hosting special junctures where multiple critical lines converge or where the very nature of the transition changes. These junctures are known as multicritical points, and their study addresses the fundamental problem of how competing ordering tendencies cooperate and clash to shape the phases of matter. This article provides a comprehensive overview of multicritical phenomena. The first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," will lay the theoretical groundwork, using Landau-Ginzburg theory and the renormalization group to classify and describe tricritical, bicritical, and Lifshitz points. Following this, the "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" chapter will bridge theory and reality, exploring the manifestation of these concepts in diverse fields such as magnetism, superconductivity, and [topological matter](@entry_id:161097). Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section will offer focused problems to solidify the understanding of key analytical techniques, guiding the reader from foundational principles to tangible applications.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the landscape of phase transitions, [critical points](@entry_id:144653) represent landmarks of singular behavior. While a standard critical point is reached by tuning a single parameter, such as temperature, the [phase diagrams](@entry_id:143029) of many physical systems exhibit a richer topology. Special points may exist where multiple critical lines intersect, or where the fundamental nature of a phase transition changes from continuous (second-order) to discontinuous (first-order). Such locations are known as **multicritical points**. Reaching a multicritical point requires the simultaneous tuning of two or more external parameters, such as temperature, pressure, or magnetic field. Their study provides deeper insights into the competition between different ordering tendencies and the organizational principles governing complex matter. This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles and mechanisms that define the most common and important types of multicritical points, using Landau-Ginzburg theory and [renormalization group](@entry_id:147717) concepts as our primary analytical tools.

### The Tricritical Point: Where First-Order Meets Second-Order

The simplest multicritical point involves a single order parameter. A **[tricritical point](@entry_id:145166) (TCP)** is a point in the phase diagram where a line of second-order phase transitions terminates and becomes a line of first-order transitions. To describe this behavior within the Landau framework, the [free energy expansion](@entry_id:138572) for a single [scalar order parameter](@entry_id:197670), $\phi$, must be extended beyond the usual $\phi^4$ term. The [minimal model](@entry_id:268530) that captures this physics is the $\phi^6$ theory, with a free energy density of the form:

$$
F(\phi) = \frac{1}{2}r\phi^2 + \frac{1}{4}u\phi^4 + \frac{1}{6}v\phi^6
$$

For stability at large $\phi$, the coefficient $v$ must be positive ($v>0$). The parameters $r$ and $u$ are the two control parameters that must be tuned to reach the TCP. Typically, $r$ is proportional to the deviation from a critical temperature, $r \propto (T - T_{c0})$, while $u$ may depend on another field like pressure.

The character of the phase transition is determined by the sign of the quartic coefficient $u$.
-   If $u > 0$, the $\phi^4$ term ensures stability, and a standard **[second-order transition](@entry_id:154877)** occurs when the quadratic coefficient vanishes, i.e., at $r=0$.
-   If $u  0$, the $\phi^4$ term is destabilizing, favoring a discontinuous transition. A **[first-order transition](@entry_id:155013)** occurs when the free energy develops a secondary minimum at $\phi \neq 0$ with the same depth as the minimum at $\phi=0$.

The [tricritical point](@entry_id:145166) is, by definition, the crossover point between these two regimes. It is therefore located at the origin of the $(r, u)$ [parameter plane](@entry_id:195289): $(r, u) = (0, 0)$.

The [phase diagram](@entry_id:142460) in the vicinity of the TCP consists of the line of second-order transitions along the positive $u$-axis ($r=0, u0$) and a line of first-order transitions extending into the $u0$ region. The location of this first-order line can be determined by finding the condition where $F(\phi)=0$ and $\partial F/\partial \phi = 0$ for a non-zero $\phi$. This calculation [@problem_id:1173574] yields the condition:

$$
r = \frac{3u^2}{16v}
$$

This equation describes the first-order boundary in the $(r,u)$ plane for $u0$. Notice that this line is parabolic and meets the second-order line ($r=0$) tangentially at the [tricritical point](@entry_id:145166) $(0,0)$, forming a cusp. If the parameters $r$ and $u$ are themselves linear functions of experimental variables like temperature $T$ and pressure $P$, e.g., $r = a_T(T - T_c) + a_P(P - P_c)$ and $u = u_P(P-P_c)$, the first-order line in the $(T,P)$ plane also meets the second-order line tangentially at the TCP [@problem_id:1173574].

A key characteristic of a [first-order transition](@entry_id:155013) is the discontinuous jump in the order parameter, $\Delta M$. As the [tricritical point](@entry_id:145166) is approached along the first-order line (i.e., as $u \to 0^-$), this jump vanishes according to a specific power law. By solving for the value of the order parameter at the [first-order transition](@entry_id:155013), one finds that $(\Delta M)^2 \propto -u/v$. This implies that the jump scales as $\Delta M \sim (-u)^{1/2}$, defining a characteristic mean-field exponent of $1/2$ for the order parameter jump [@problem_id:1173569].

Tricritical behavior can also be induced when an order parameter couples to another, non-ordering degree of freedom, such as elastic strain. Consider a system that is second-order without such a coupling, described by $f = \frac{a}{2}\psi^2 + \frac{b_0}{4}\psi^4 + \dots$ with $b_0  0$. If a coupling of the form $\gamma e \psi^2$ to a strain field $e$ is introduced, along with an elastic energy $\frac{K}{2}e^2$, the strain field can be integrated out. Minimizing the free energy with respect to $e$ gives $e = -(\gamma/K)\psi^2$. Substituting this back into the free energy renormalizes the quartic coefficient to an effective value $b_{\text{eff}} = b_0 - 2\gamma^2/K$. A [tricritical point](@entry_id:145166) is reached when this effective coefficient vanishes, which occurs at a [critical coupling strength](@entry_id:263868) of $\gamma_c = \sqrt{b_0 K / 2}$ [@problem_id:1173588]. This mechanism, where integrating out fast degrees of freedom modifies the effective interactions of the slow, ordering degrees of freedom, is a general and powerful concept in [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) physics.

### Competing Orders: Bicritical and Tetracritical Points

When a system possesses two or more distinct ordering tendencies, their competition or cooperation can lead to even more complex multicritical points. Consider a system with two scalar order parameters, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, described by a Ginzburg-Landau free energy density with full rotational symmetry in the $(\phi_1, \phi_2)$ plane for the quadratic terms:

$$
f(\phi_1, \phi_2) = \frac{r_1}{2}\phi_1^2 + \frac{r_2}{2}\phi_2^2 + \frac{u_1}{4}\phi_1^4 + \frac{u_2}{4}\phi_2^4 + \frac{u_{12}}{2}\phi_1^2 \phi_2^2
$$

Here, we assume $u_1  0$ and $u_2  0$ for stability. The multicritical point is located at $(r_1, r_2) = (0,0)$ [@problem_id:1173567]. The nature of this point is determined by the inter-[mode coupling](@entry_id:752088) $u_{12}$. The stability of a potential mixed phase, where both $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are non-zero, depends on the quartic terms. This stability is ensured if the Hessian matrix of the quartic potential (in variables $\phi_1^2, \phi_2^2$) is positive definite, which leads to the condition $u_{12}^2  u_1 u_2$.

-   A **[bicritical point](@entry_id:140789)** occurs when the coupling is repulsive and strong, specifically when $u_{12}^2  u_1 u_2$. In this scenario, the presence of one order parameter energetically suppresses the other. The [phase diagram](@entry_id:142460) features two distinct [second-order transition](@entry_id:154877) lines, $r_1=0$ (for $r_20$) and $r_2=0$ (for $r_10$), which meet at the [bicritical point](@entry_id:140789). These lines separate the disordered phase from two distinct [ordered phases](@entry_id:202961): Phase I ($\phi_1 \neq 0, \phi_2=0$) and Phase II ($\phi_1=0, \phi_2 \neq 0$). For $r_1, r_2  0$, these two [ordered phases](@entry_id:202961) are separated by a [first-order transition](@entry_id:155013) line. The geometry of the phase diagram in terms of experimental variables (e.g., temperature $T$ and field $X$) depends on how $r_1$ and $r_2$ couple to them. If $r_i = a_i(T-T_c) + b_i(X-X_c)$, the angle $\theta$ between the two second-order lines meeting at the [bicritical point](@entry_id:140789) is given by $\tan\theta = |a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1| / |a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2|$ [@problem_id:1173438]. In the special case where $u_{12} = \sqrt{u_1 u_2}$, the quartic part of the free energy becomes a [perfect square](@entry_id:635622), $(\sqrt{u_1}\phi_1^2 + \sqrt{u_2}\phi_2^2)^2/4$. This introduces a higher symmetry, and the first-order line separating the two [ordered phases](@entry_id:202961) becomes a straight line in the $(r_1, r_2)$ plane with a slope $dr_2/dr_1 = \sqrt{u_2/u_1}$ [@problem_id:1173467].

-   A **[tetracritical point](@entry_id:144151)** occurs when the coupling is weaker, $u_{12}^2  u_1 u_2$. This condition allows for the existence of a stable mixed phase where both order parameters coexist ($\phi_1 \neq 0, \phi_2 \neq 0$). The [phase diagram](@entry_id:142460) thus contains four critical lines meeting at the [tetracritical point](@entry_id:144151), separating the disordered phase, the two single-order-parameter phases, and the mixed phase. As with tricritical points, coupling to other degrees of freedom can tune the system between bicritical and tetracritical behavior. For instance, coupling the order parameters to a strain field $\epsilon$ via a term $A\phi_1\phi_2\epsilon$ can renormalize the interaction to $u_{12}^{\text{eff}} = u_{12} - A^2/(2C)$, where $C$ is the elastic modulus. This can drive a system that is initially bicritical ($u_{12}  \sqrt{u_1 u_2}$) into the tetracritical regime as the coupling $A$ increases [@problem_id:1173532].

A profound concept associated with certain multicritical points is **symmetry enhancement**. Often, the symmetry of the effective Hamiltonian at the multicritical point itself is higher than the symmetries on the adjoining critical lines. A classic example is a [bicritical point](@entry_id:140789) in an easy-axis [antiferromagnet](@entry_id:137114) [@problem_id:1173499]. The transition from the paramagnetic to the easy-axis antiferromagnetic phase has O(1) (Ising) symmetry, while the transition to the "spin-flop" phase has O(2) (XY) symmetry. The [bicritical point](@entry_id:140789) where these two lines meet is described by a single effective Hamiltonian with a three-component order parameter and full O(3) [rotational symmetry](@entry_id:137077). The lower symmetries of the critical lines emerge as the [bicritical point](@entry_id:140789) is left along specific directions in parameter space.

### The Lifshitz Point: Competition in Momentum Space

Not all ordering competition occurs between different order parameter fields; it can also occur between different spatial arrangements of the same order parameter. This leads to the **Lifshitz point**, a multicritical point where three phases meet: a disordered phase, a uniformly ordered phase, and a spatially modulated ordered phase (such as a helical or striped phase).

This behavior is captured by a Ginzburg-Landau functional with competing gradient terms. The standard $(\nabla\phi)^2$ term favors uniform order, but if interactions at different length scales compete, higher-order gradient terms can become important. A [minimal model](@entry_id:268530) is:
$$
F[\phi] = \int d^d x \left[ r\phi^2 + c_2(\nabla\phi)^2 + c_4(\nabla^2\phi)^2 + u\phi^4 \right]
$$
with $c_4  0$ and $u  0$ for stability. The transition from the disordered phase is heralded by the softening of a fluctuation mode at a particular [wavevector](@entry_id:178620) $\mathbf{k}_0$, which minimizes the inverse susceptibility $\Gamma(\mathbf{k}) = r + c_2 k^2 + c_4 k^4$.

- If $c_2  0$, the minimum is at $k_0 = 0$, leading to a uniform ordered phase for $r0$.
- If $c_2  0$, the minimum occurs at a finite [wavevector](@entry_id:178620) $k_0^2 = -c_2/(2c_4)$, leading to a [modulated phase](@entry_id:141499).

The Lifshitz point is the special point that separates these two regimes. It is defined by two conditions: the ordering occurs at zero [wavevector](@entry_id:178620) ($k_0=0$), and the "stiffness" associated with long-wavelength fluctuations vanishes. In this model, these conditions correspond to $c_2=0$ and the transition occurring at $r=0$. Thus, the Lifshitz point is located at $(r_L, c_{2L}) = (0,0)$ in the $(r, c_2)$ plane [@problem_id:1173476].

A key feature of the Lifshitz point is **[anisotropic scaling](@entry_id:261477)**. Correlations and fluctuations behave differently in directions parallel and perpendicular to the potential [modulation](@entry_id:260640) wavevector (even though this vector is vanishing at the Lifshitz point itself). Near the Lifshitz point, the quadratic part of the free energy is dominated by terms like $k_\perp^2$ and $k_\parallel^4$. This anisotropy implies that the correlation lengths diverge with different exponents: $\xi_\perp \sim r^{-1/2}$ and $\xi_\parallel \sim r^{-1/4}$. Their relationship defines the **anisotropy exponent** $\theta$, where $\xi_\parallel \sim \xi_\perp^\theta$. From the mean-field scaling, we find $\theta=1/2$ [@problem_id:1173498].

### The Renormalization Group View of Multicriticality

The Landau (mean-field) theory provides a powerful qualitative picture, but a complete understanding of [critical phenomena](@entry_id:144727) requires the [renormalization group](@entry_id:147717) (RG). The RG reveals that multicritical points correspond to special, higher-instability fixed points in the flow of coupling constants.

#### Upper Critical Dimension

A central concept in RG is the **[upper critical dimension](@entry_id:142063), $d_c$**, above which mean-field theory exponents are exact because fluctuations are irrelevant. This dimension can be determined by a simple power-counting argument, which identifies the dimensionality at which the leading interaction term in the Hamiltonian becomes marginal (dimensionless).

For a [tricritical point](@entry_id:145166), the critical action is dominated by the kinetic term and the $\phi^6$ interaction. A [scaling analysis](@entry_id:153681) [@problem_id:1173585] shows that the [scaling dimension](@entry_id:145515) of the field is $\Delta_\phi = (d-2)/2$. The $\phi^6$ coupling constant is marginal when $d - 6\Delta_\phi = 0$, which yields $6-2d=0$, so $\boldsymbol{d_c=3}$ for a [tricritical point](@entry_id:145166). This is lower than the $d_c=4$ for a standard critical point, signifying that fluctuations are more potent and relevant in a wider range of dimensions.

This power-counting method is remarkably versatile.
- For a [tricritical point](@entry_id:145166) with long-range interactions decaying such that the kinetic term in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936) is $|k|^\sigma$, the [upper critical dimension](@entry_id:142063) becomes $d_c = 3\sigma/2$ [@problem_id:1173446].
- At a point that is simultaneously Lifshitz and tricritical, the kinetic term is $(\nabla^2\phi)^2 \sim k^4$ and the interaction is $\phi^6$. This leads to an [upper critical dimension](@entry_id:142063) of $d_c=6$ [@problem_id:1173591].
- The framework can be extended to [quantum phase transitions](@entry_id:146027). For a quantum [tricritical point](@entry_id:145166) with dissipative dynamics described by a frequency term $|\omega|^\alpha$ in the action, the dynamical exponent is $z=2/\alpha$. The upper critical spatial dimension is then $d_c = 3 - 2/\alpha$ [@problem_id:1173489].
- An alternative path to $d_c$ is via the [hyperscaling relation](@entry_id:148877), $d\nu = 2-\alpha$. At $d=d_c$, this relation is satisfied by the mean-field exponents. For a multicritical point of order $m$ (where the potential is $\phi^{2m}$), the mean-field exponents are $\nu=1/2$ and $\alpha=(m-2)/(m-1)$, giving $d_c = 2m/(m-1)$. For a standard critical point ($m=2$), $d_c=4$. For a [tricritical point](@entry_id:145166) ($m=3$), $d_c=3$. For $m=4$, one finds $d_c=8/3$ [@problem_id:141771].

#### RG Flows and Competing Fixed Points

In the RG framework, different [universality classes](@entry_id:143033) correspond to different stable fixed points of the RG flow equations. A multicritical point is typically an [unstable fixed point](@entry_id:269029) that lies on the boundary between the basins of attraction of two or more stable fixed points. For a bicritical system with two $n$-component fields, the RG flow in the plane of quartic couplings $(u, v)$ can be analyzed. For $2  n  4$, there is an unstable trajectory (a separatrix) emerging from the Gaussian fixed point that divides the flow into two regions: one flowing to a "decoupled" fixed point (describing two independent systems) and another flowing to a higher-symmetry O(2n) fixed point [@problem_id:1173452]. The multicritical behavior is associated with starting on this [separatrix](@entry_id:175112). The existence and stability of such fixed points can depend sensitively on system parameters like the number of order parameter components, $N$. For example, the cubic fixed point, relevant to certain bicritical phenomena, only exists for $N  N_c^* \approx 4.75$ in the one-loop approximation (where $N_c^* = 19/4$ is a specific approximation) [@problem_id:1173444].

### Universality and the Impact of Disorder

Despite the added complexity, the principle of universality still holds at multicritical points, albeit within more refined classes. This means that certain dimensionless ratios of physical quantities are independent of microscopic details. For instance, at a [tetracritical point](@entry_id:144151), the ratio of the specific heat jumps at the two uncoupled transitions can be a universal number [@problem_id:1173459]. Similarly, the ratio of the susceptibilities for the two order parameters, $\chi_1/\chi_2$, is predicted to approach a universal value as the [tetracritical point](@entry_id:144151) is approached along any straight line from the disordered phase [@problem_id:1173494].

Finally, the heightened role of fluctuations near multicritical points makes them particularly sensitive to perturbations like [quenched disorder](@entry_id:144393). The relevance of weak disorder is determined by the Harris criterion. For a [tricritical point](@entry_id:145166), an adaptation of this criterion shows that random-bond disorder (fluctuations in the local transition temperature) is a relevant perturbation if the tricritical [specific heat](@entry_id:136923) exponent $\alpha_t  0$. Since [mean-field theory](@entry_id:145338) gives $\alpha_t = 1/2$, this suggests that disorder will generally alter the nature of tricritical points in realistic dimensions ($d \le 3$) [@problem_id:1173539].

In summary, multicritical points represent a fascinating frontier in the study of phase transitions. They are characterized by the confluence of distinct critical behaviors and are governed by principles of competing interactions, symmetry enhancement, and the intricate fixed point structure of the renormalization group. Their theoretical study not only deepens our understanding of collective phenomena but also provides crucial guidance for experiments in the rich and complex phase diagrams of real materials.
