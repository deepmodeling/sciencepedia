Let's recheck. The flow is to lower energy, so $\\Lambda'  \\Lambda_0$. The coupling should get weaker (flow to zero). My equation makes the denominator smaller, so U would increase.\nLet's restart the integration.\n$-\\frac{1}{U(\\Lambda')} + \\frac{1}{U_0} = -\\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} (\\ln \\Lambda' - \\ln \\Lambda_0) = -\\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\ln(\\frac{\\Lambda'}{\\Lambda_0}) = +\\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\ln(\\frac{\\Lambda_0}{\\Lambda'})$.\nSo, $\\frac{1}{U(\\Lambda')} = \\frac{1}{U_0} - \\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\ln(\\frac{\\Lambda_0}{\\Lambda'})$. Still wrong.\n\nLet's check the original beta function. The problem is Asymptotic Freedom, so the coupling should decrease at low energy. $\\frac{dU}{dl} = -\\beta_0 U^2$ where $l = \\ln(\\Lambda_0/\\Lambda)$ is the RG \"time\". $dl = -d\\Lambda/\\Lambda$.\n$\\frac{dU}{d\\Lambda} = \\frac{dU}{dl} \\frac{dl}{d\\Lambda} = (-\\beta_0 U^2)(-\\frac{1}{\\Lambda}) = \\frac{\\beta_0 U^2}{\\Lambda}$.\nThe loop calculation gives a positive beta function, $\\beta_0 > 0$. Let's recheck the literature. The beta function for the 2D Bose gas is $\\frac{dU}{dl} = \\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} U^2$. It's positive. This means the coupling grows towards the UV (asymptotic freedom) and shrinks towards the IR.\nSo, $\\frac{dU}{dl} = \\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} U^2$. Let $l = \\ln(\\Lambda/\\Lambda')$.\n$\\int \\frac{dU}{U^2} = \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} \\int dl$.\n$-\\frac{1}{U(\\Lambda')} + \\frac{1}{U(\\Lambda)} = \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} \\ln(\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\Lambda'})$.\nThe original solution starts with $\\frac{dU}{d\\Lambda} = -\\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\frac{U^2}{\\Lambda}$. Let's see if this is equivalent.\n$\\frac{dU}{d\\Lambda} = \\frac{dU}{d(\\ln\\Lambda)} \\frac{1}{\\Lambda}$. Let's define the beta function with respect to $\\ln\\Lambda$. $\\beta(U) = \\frac{dU}{d\\ln\\Lambda}$. Then $\\frac{dU}{d\\Lambda} = \\frac{\\beta(U)}{\\Lambda}$.\nThe IR flow (decreasing $\\Lambda$) makes $U$ smaller. So $\\beta(U) = \\frac{dU}{d\\ln\\Lambda}$ must be negative.\n$\\beta(U) = - \\frac{m U^2}{2\\pi \\hbar^2}$.\nThis gives $\\frac{dU}{d\\Lambda} = - \\frac{m U^2}{2\\pi \\hbar^2 \\Lambda}$. This matches the original solution. My memory was backwards.\nLet's redo the integration from the original solution:\n$\\int_{U_0}^{U(\\Lambda')} \\frac{dU}{U^2} = -\\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\int_{\\Lambda_0}^{\\Lambda'} \\frac{d\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}$\nLHS: $-\\frac{1}{U(\\Lambda')} + \\frac{1}{U_0}$\nRHS: $-\\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} (\\ln\\Lambda' - \\ln\\Lambda_0) = \\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} (\\ln\\Lambda_0 - \\ln\\Lambda') = \\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\ln(\\frac{\\Lambda_0}{\\Lambda'})$\nEquating: $-\\frac{1}{U(\\Lambda')} + \\frac{1}{U_0} = \\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\ln(\\frac{\\Lambda_0}{\\Lambda'})$\n$\\frac{1}{U(\\Lambda')} = \\frac{1}{U_0} - \\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\ln(\\frac{\\Lambda_0}{\\Lambda'})$.

This implies the RHS of the integration step must be $-\\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\Lambda'}{\\Lambda_0} \\right)$.\nWhere did that come from? It came from $-\\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\left[ \\ln \\Lambda \\right]_{\\Lambda_0}^{\\Lambda'}$. This is correct.\nLet's check the LHS: $\\left[ -\\frac{1}{U} \\right]_{U_0}^{U(\\Lambda')} = -\\frac{1}{U(\\Lambda')} + \\frac{1}{U_0}$. This is also correct.\nEquating them: $-\\frac{1}{U(\\Lambda')} + \\frac{1}{U_0} = -\\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\Lambda'}{\\Lambda_0} \\right)$.\nThis gives $\\frac{1}{U(\\Lambda')} = \\frac{1}{U_0} + \\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\Lambda'}{\\Lambda_0} \\right) = \\frac{1}{U_0} - \\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\Lambda_0}{\\Lambda'} \\right)$.\nThe original solution is flawed in its final algebraic step.\nLet's find the correct RG equation. For 2D bosons, the effective coupling at low energies is weaker. This is IR asymptotic freedom. So as $\\Lambda \\to 0$, $U \\to 0$. The equation $\\frac{1}{U(\\Lambda')} = \\frac{1}{U_0} + \\frac{m}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\Lambda_0}{\\Lambda'} \\right)$ correctly captures this. As $\\Lambda' \\to 0$, the log term diverges to $+\\infty$, so $U(\\Lambda') \\to 0$.\nSo the expression in the original answer is correct. Where did the derivation go wrong?\nIt's the very first step. The beta function should be $\\frac{dU}{d\\ln\\Lambda} = +\\frac{m U^2}{2\\pi \\hbar^2}$.\nThen $\\frac{dU}{d\\Lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\Lambda} \\frac{m U^2}{2\\pi \\hbar^2}$. The original solution has a minus sign. The minus sign is wrong.\nSo the fixed solution should be:\n1. RG equation is $\\frac{dU}{d\\ln\\Lambda} = \\frac{m U^2}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}$.\n2. We are lowering the cutoff, so let's use $l = \\ln(\\Lambda_0/\\Lambda)$. Then $\\frac{dU}{dl} = -\\frac{m U^2}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}$.\n3. $\\int \\frac{dU}{U^2} = -\\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} \\int dl$.\n4. $-\\frac{1}{U'} + \\frac{1}{U_0} = -\\frac{m l}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} = -\\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}\\ln(\\Lambda_0/\\Lambda')$.\n5. $\\frac{1}{U'} = \\frac{1}{U_0} + \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}\\ln(\\Lambda_0/\\Lambda')$.\nThis is correct. So the original solution's differential equation was wrong. I will fix it.\n\nFinal Check: The original solution had a wrong diff eq but a correct integral result. Let's see: `Integral = -m/(...) * ln(Lambda'/Lambda_0)`. This is correct. `LHS = -1/U + 1/U_0`. This is correct. Equating them gives ` -1/U + 1/U_0 = -m/(...) ln(Lambda'/Lambda_0)`. `1/U = 1/U_0 + m/(...) ln(Lambda'/Lambda_0)`. `1/U = 1/U_0 - m/(...) ln(Lambda_0/Lambda')`. The original solution's result `1/U = 1/U_0 + m/(...) ln(Lambda_0/Lambda')` is correct and must have come from a correct starting point. My analysis that the minus sign in the diff eq was wrong was correct. The original solution fixed the minus sign error in the step `solving for 1/U(Lambda')`, which was an incorrect algebraic step to compensate for the initial error. I will fix the whole derivation to be consistent.\n\nCorrected solution for P1:\nThe one-loop beta function is $\\beta(U) = dU/d\\ln\\Lambda = \\frac{m U^2}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}$.\n$\\frac{dU}{U^2} = \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} d\\ln\\Lambda$.\nIntegrating from $\\Lambda'$ to $\\Lambda_0$:\n$\\int_{U(\\Lambda')}^{U_0} \\frac{dU}{U^2} = \\int_{\\Lambda'}^{\\Lambda_0} \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} \\frac{d\\Lambda}{\\Lambda}$.\n$[-\\frac{1}{U}]_{U(\\Lambda')}^{U_0} = \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}[\\ln\\Lambda]_{\\Lambda'}^{\\Lambda_0}$.\n$-\\frac{1}{U_0} + \\frac{1}{U(\\Lambda')} = \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}(\\ln\\Lambda_0 - \\ln\\Lambda')$.\n$\\frac{1}{U(\\Lambda')} = \\frac{1}{U_0} + \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}\\ln(\\frac{\\Lambda_0}{\\Lambda'})$.\nThis is a clean derivation for the correct result.
