The Hamiltonian for the system is given by:\n$$ H = -J \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} s_i s_j $$\nwhere $s_i = \\pm 1$ are classical spins located at the sites $i$ of the lattice, the sum $\\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle}$ runs over all pairs of nearest-neighbor sites, and $J$ is the coupling constant. If $J > 0$, the interaction is ferromagnetic, favoring aligned spins. If $J  0$, the interaction is antiferromagnetic, favoring anti-aligned spins.\n\nCertain lattice geometries can lead to a phenomenon known as \"geometric frustration\" in the antiferromagnetic case. This occurs when the arrangement of spins cannot simultaneously satisfy all the pairwise energetic preferences. A canonical example is the Kagome lattice.\n\nThe two-dimensional Kagome lattice is composed of corner-sharing triangles, as depicted in the schematic below.

Each site is shared by 2 triangles, so the number of triangles, $N_t$, satisfies:\n$$ 3 N_t = 2 N \\implies N_t = \\frac{2}{3} N. $$\nEach bond belongs to exactly one triangle.\n\nFor the antiferromagnetic Ising model ($J_{AF}  0$), the energy is minimized when neighboring spins are anti-aligned, but geometric frustration occurs due to the triangular structure. In each triangle, it is impossible to satisfy all three bonds (i.e., have $s_i s_j = -1$ for all bonds).
