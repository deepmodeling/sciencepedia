Within a space group, a Wyckoff position is a set of points that are equivalent under the symmetry operations of the group. The number of such equivalent points within a single conventional unit cell is called the multiplicity of the Wyckoff position.\n\nConsider the space group $I4/mcm$ (No. 140) of the tetragonal crystal system. The 'I' indicates that the lattice is body-centered, meaning that in addition to the lattice points at the corners of the conventional unit cell, there is also a lattice point at its center. A point with fractional coordinates $(x, y, z)$ in the unit cell is thus equivalent to a point at $(x+1/2, y+1/2, z+1/2)$.\n\nThe symmetry operations of the space group $I4/mcm$ (for a specific choice of origin) acting on a point $(x, y, z)$ generate a set of equivalent points. The operations related to the point group, which include rotations, reflections, and glide translations, generate a set of 16 positions within the unit cell:\n1. $(x,y,z)$\n2. $(-x,-y,z)$\n3. $(-y,x,z)$\n4. $(y,-x,z)$\n5. $(x,-y,z+1/2)$\n6. $(-x,y,z+1/2)$\n7. $(-y,-x,z+1/2)$\n8. $(y,x,z+1/2)$\n9. $(-x,-y,-z)$\n10. $(x,y,-z)$\n11. $(y,-x,-z)$\n12. $(-y,x,-z)$\n13. $(-x,y,-z+1/2)$\n14. $(x,-y,-z+1/2)$\n15. $(y,x,-z+1/2)$\n16. $(-y,-x,-z+1/2)$\n\nA Wyckoff position is generated by starting with a specific \"seed\" coordinate and applying all the symmetry operations of the space group. For certain high-symmetry coordinates, some of these operations will map the point back onto itself, leading to a multiplicity lower than the general position multiplicity (which is 32 for $I4/mcm$, or 16 before considering centering).\n\nThe Wyckoff position labeled 4(a) for this space group can be generated from the seed coordinate $(0, 0, 1/4)$.\n\nCalculate the multiplicity of this Wyckoff position.", "solution": "1.
