## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The Wiedemann-Franz law, in its ideal form, serves as a foundational principle of Landau's Fermi liquid theory. Its statement, that the Lorenz number $L = \kappa / (\sigma T)$ assumes the universal value $L_0 = (\pi^2/3)(k_B/e)^2$, is a direct consequence of charge and heat being carried by the same fermionic quasiparticles and relaxed by the same [elastic scattering](@entry_id:152152) processes. While the preceding chapters established the theoretical underpinnings of this law, this chapter explores its application as a powerful diagnostic tool in the real world. We will examine a diverse range of physical systems, from conventional metals to exotic quantum matter, to understand when the law holds, when it is modified, and when it is profoundly violated. These case studies demonstrate that the Lorenz ratio is not merely a material parameter but a deep probe into the nature of charge, heat, and the elementary excitations that carry them.

### The Robustness of the Wiedemann-Franz Law

The validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law extends far beyond the simple Drude model, proving remarkably robust in any system that can be described as a Fermi liquid with dominant elastic scattering. This robustness persists even when the properties of the quasiparticles or the nature of the scatterers are highly unconventional.

A compelling example is found in [heavy fermion compounds](@entry_id:144351). At low temperatures, these [strongly correlated materials](@entry_id:198946) enter a coherent regime where their behavior is well-described by Fermi liquid theory, but with [emergent quasiparticles](@entry_id:144760) possessing an enormous effective mass, $m^*$, that can be hundreds or even thousands of times the free electron mass. Despite this dramatic [renormalization](@entry_id:143501), the quasiparticles are well-defined, and their scattering at low temperatures is predominantly elastic. Consequently, the large effective mass influences both the electrical and thermal conductivities in a proportional manner, and its effect cancels out in the Lorenz ratio. The system, therefore, adheres strictly to the Wiedemann-Franz law, yielding $L = L_0$. This illustrates that the law is sensitive not to the "heaviness" of the charge carriers, but to the conservation of the quasiparticle description and the elasticity of scattering. [@problem_id:1221144]

The nature of the elastic scatterers can also be unconventional without affecting the Lorenz number. In [mesoscopic physics](@entry_id:138415), transport can be limited by the physical boundaries of a sample. For a sufficiently pure, thin metallic wire, the dominant scattering mechanism can be diffuse [elastic collisions](@entry_id:188584) with the wire's surfaces. Although this geometric scattering is fundamentally different from bulk [impurity scattering](@entry_id:267814), its elastic nature ensures that both charge and heat currents are degraded in the same proportion, preserving the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law. [@problem_id:1221117] A similar principle applies to quasiparticle transport in the mixed state of a clean type-II superconductor, where scattering is dominated by the Abrikosov [vortex lattice](@entry_id:140837). As this scattering is elastic, the Lorenz number for the quasiparticles remains $L_0$. [@problem_id:1221214]

Even in systems with complex band structures and energy-dependent scattering, the Wiedemann-Franz law can be unexpectedly resilient. The helical [surface states](@entry_id:137922) of a three-dimensional [topological insulator](@entry_id:137103), for instance, are characterized by a linear, cone-like dispersion and a relaxation time $\tau(\epsilon)$ that is inversely proportional to energy for scattering off non-magnetic scalar impurities. A naive expectation might be that a strongly energy-dependent scattering rate would lead to a violation of the law. However, a rigorous calculation using the Boltzmann transport equation reveals a subtle cancellation: the energy dependence of the [relaxation time](@entry_id:142983) is precisely counteracted by energy-dependent terms from the [density of states](@entry_id:147894) and group velocity, ultimately restoring the Lorenz number to the universal value $L = L_0$. This serves as a critical lesson that the conditions for the law's validity must be assessed through a complete transport calculation rather than by intuition alone. [@problem_id:1221148]

Finally, the robustness of the Wiedemann-Franz law can manifest in surprising contexts, such as in holographic models of strongly [correlated metals](@entry_id:142422). Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, certain "[strange metals](@entry_id:141452)" can be modeled by a D3/D7 brane setup. In the specific case of zero chemical potential, even in the presence of a strong magnetic field, the theory predicts that the Lorenz number for transport perpendicular to the field is exactly $L_0$. This indicates that [strong coupling](@entry_id:136791), in and of itself, is not a [sufficient condition](@entry_id:276242) for violating the Wiedemann-Franz law; the specific symmetries and properties of the strongly interacting state are paramount. [@problem_id:1221175]

### Violations of the Wiedemann-Franz Law: A Window into Exotic Physics

Deviations from the universal Lorenz number are often more illuminating than its confirmation, signaling the breakdown of one or more of the core assumptions of Fermi liquid theory. Such violations are not mere curiosities; they are signatures of novel transport mechanisms, inelastic processes, or a complete departure from the quasiparticle paradigm.

#### Violations from Inelastic Scattering

The most common reason for a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law is the presence of inelastic scattering, particularly [electron-electron scattering](@entry_id:152847). Such collisions conserve the total momentum of the electron system but are highly effective at degrading a thermal current. This leads to a decoupling of the relaxation mechanisms for charge and heat.

This effect is most pronounced in the **electron hydrodynamic regime**, observed in ultra-pure materials at intermediate temperatures. Here, frequent electron-electron collisions (with timescale $\tau_{ee}$) cause the electrons to behave like a viscous fluid, while rarer momentum-relaxing scattering (e.g., from impurities, with timescale $\tau_{imp} \gg \tau_{ee}$) is what ultimately limits the electrical current. The thermal current, however, is relaxed primarily by the rapid electron-electron collisions. As a result, the thermal conductivity is suppressed relative to the electrical conductivity, leading to a Lorenz number $L = L_0 (\tau_{ee} / \tau_{imp})$, which can be much smaller than $L_0$. The Wiedemann-Franz law is thus strongly violated, and the degree of violation directly measures the ratio of the two dominant scattering timescales. [@problem_id:83308] This principle can be captured phenomenologically by modeling the [quasiparticle lifetime](@entry_id:145453) with a strong energy dependence characteristic of [inelastic scattering](@entry_id:138624), which likewise results in a Lorenz number that deviates from $L_0$. [@problem_id:1822828]

This violation has significant interdisciplinary implications, particularly in the field of [thermoelectrics](@entry_id:142625). The efficiency of a thermoelectric material is quantified by the figure of merit, $ZT = S^2 \sigma T / \kappa$. A high $ZT$ requires a large Seebeck coefficient $S$ and electrical conductivity $\sigma$, but a low thermal conductivity $\kappa$. The suppression of $\kappa$ relative to $\sigma$ in the electron hydrodynamic regime—the very essence of the Wiedemann-Franz violation—can therefore enhance $ZT$. In this context, understanding and engineering violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law is a key strategy for developing more efficient thermoelectric devices. [@problem_id:246347]

Even when scattering is elastic, geometric confinement can induce an *effective* energy dependence in scattering that causes a small deviation from the WF law. In very thin metallic films, the probability of an [electron scattering](@entry_id:159023) from the surface depends on its trajectory, which in turn depends on its energy. This leads to a size-dependent Lorenz number that is slightly less than $L_0$, with a correction that depends on temperature and film thickness. This is a subtle but important example of how mesoscopic effects can induce WF violation. [@problem_id:1058867]

#### Violations from Unconventional Transport Mechanisms

The Wiedemann-Franz law relies on the premise that the same entities carry both charge and heat. When this is not the case, the law is invariably broken.

One clear example is found in materials where transport occurs via the thermally activated hopping of **small [polarons](@entry_id:191083)**. Here, charge carriers are localized by strong [electron-phonon coupling](@entry_id:139197) and move by hopping between sites, a process requiring an activation energy $E_A$. The heat carried in this process is directly related to $E_A$, not the kinetic energy of a quasiparticle. This leads to a Lorenz number that is fundamentally different from $L_0$ and depends on the ratio of activation energy to thermal energy. For the specific case where thermal energy equals the activation energy ($k_B T = E_A$), the Lorenz number is $L = (k_B/e)^2$, a factor of $\pi^2/3$ smaller than the Fermi liquid value. [@problem_id:1221224]

An even more dramatic [decoupling](@entry_id:160890) of charge and [heat transport](@entry_id:199637) occurs at the interface between a **normal metal and a superconductor (NS)**. At temperatures well below the superconducting gap $\Delta$, an electron from the normal metal cannot enter the superconductor as a conventional quasiparticle. Instead, charge is transferred via Andreev reflection, where the incident electron is reflected as a hole, creating a Cooper pair that enters the superconductor. This process transfers a charge of $2e$ across the interface but carries no net heat current. Heat transport, in contrast, relies on the tunneling of rare, thermally excited quasiparticles with energy greater than $\Delta$. Because charge and heat are carried by entirely different processes with different energy scales, the Wiedemann-Franz law is severely violated. The resulting Lorenz number is strongly enhanced and exhibits an exponential dependence on temperature, $L \propto \exp(-\Delta / k_B T)$. [@problem_id:1221189]

#### Violations from the Breakdown of the Quasiparticle Picture

In the most exotic states of quantum matter, the very concept of a quasiparticle can fail. These non-Fermi liquids represent a frontier of [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) physics, and violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law are among their defining characteristics.

A seemingly simple yet profound example is **pristine graphene at the [charge neutrality](@entry_id:138647) (Dirac) point**. At this point, the density of states vanishes, and the Fermi "surface" shrinks to a point. The standard low-temperature Sommerfeld expansion used to derive the Wiedemann-Franz law breaks down completely. A full calculation using the Boltzmann equation reveals that the Lorenz number is not $L_0$, but a new universal constant that depends on the details of the dispersion. For single-layer graphene with its linear dispersion, the Lorenz number is $L = (k_B/e)^2 (9\zeta(3) / (2\ln 2))$, while for bilayer graphene with its quadratic dispersion, it takes on yet another universal value. This demonstrates that even in a non-interacting system, the breakdown of the Fermi surface concept leads to a violation of the law. [@problem_id:1221230] [@problem_id:1221173]

In **one-dimensional interacting systems**, known as **Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs)**, interactions cause the elementary excitations to fractionalize into independent collective modes for charge (holons) and spin (spinons). In a spinful TLL, both the charge and spin modes are gapless and contribute to heat transport, each carrying a universal [quantum of thermal conductance](@entry_id:190013). However, only the charge mode carries electric current. This fundamental [decoupling](@entry_id:160890) of heat carriers (holons and spinons) from charge carriers (holons only) results in a strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. The Lorenz number becomes $L = 2L_0 / K_c$, where $K_c$ is the Luttinger parameter that quantifies the interaction strength ($K_c  1$ for repulsive interactions). For a spinless TLL, there is only a single charge mode, leading to $L = L_0/K$. This interaction-dependent Lorenz number is a hallmark of Luttinger liquid physics. [@problem_id:1221095] [@problem_id:715929]

Similar physics governs transport in the edge states of **fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems**. These chiral one-dimensional modes are also not Fermi liquids. For the $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state, the edge is described by a conformal field theory which predicts a quantized [thermal conductance](@entry_id:189019). The [electrical conductance](@entry_id:261932) is also quantized but is proportional to the fractional [filling factor](@entry_id:146022) $\nu$. The resulting Lorenz number is $L = \pi^2 k_B^2 / e^2 = 3L_0$, a universal value that reflects the fractionalized nature of the charge carriers. [@problem_id:1221115] In the bulk of the FQH state at [filling factor](@entry_id:146022) $\nu=1/2$, the system is described as a **composite Fermi liquid**. Here, [charge transport](@entry_id:194535) is limited by scattering from both impurities and [emergent gauge field](@entry_id:145980) fluctuations, whereas [heat transport](@entry_id:199637) is only affected by [impurity scattering](@entry_id:267814). This again decouples the two currents and leads to a Lorenz number larger than $L_0$. [@problem_id:1221206]

At a **quantum critical point (QCP)**—a phase transition at zero temperature—the system is [scale-invariant](@entry_id:178566) and lacks any quasiparticle description. Transport is governed by the collective dynamics of critical fluctuations. Scaling arguments predict that the Lorenz ratio itself should exhibit a power-law dependence on temperature, $L(T) \propto T^\eta$. The exponent $\eta$ is universal and depends only on the system's dimensionality and its dynamical critical exponent, making the temperature scaling of the Lorenz ratio a key experimental signature of [quantum criticality](@entry_id:143927). [@problem_id:141782]

Finally, theoretical models of [quantum chaos](@entry_id:139638), such as the **Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model**, provide a solvable framework for studying non-Fermi liquid transport. In this model of fermions with random all-to-all interactions, the Lorenz number can be calculated exactly in the strong-coupling limit. The result deviates from $L_0$ and depends on the fermion filling, providing a theoretical benchmark for transport in systems thought to exhibit [maximal chaos](@entry_id:145650) and a complete absence of quasiparticles. [@problem_id:1221201]

In conclusion, the Wiedemann-Franz law is far more than a simple rule of thumb for metals. Its confirmation provides strong evidence for Fermi liquid behavior, even in complex systems. More importantly, its violation serves as a powerful and quantitative probe, offering deep insights into the most fascinating phenomena in modern physics, including [inelastic scattering](@entry_id:138624) dynamics, unconventional transport channels, and the fractionalized, collective, or chaotic nature of excitations in non-Fermi liquid [states of matter](@entry_id:139436).
