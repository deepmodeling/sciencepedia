The process is governed by the conservation of crystal momentum, which differs from momentum conservation in free space by the possible addition of a reciprocal lattice vector. This exercise provides a foundational analysis of the kinematic threshold for Umklapp processes in a one-dimensional system, directly linking the condition to the special case of half-filling. Mastering this calculation is the first step toward appreciating why phenomena like Mott insulation are often tied to specific electron densities. [@problem_id:2972321]", "problem": "Consider non-interacting spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ electrons in a one-dimensional periodic crystal with lattice constant $a$, described by a single-band nearest-neighbor tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian with dispersion $E(k) = -2t\\cos(ka)$, where $t0$ is the hopping amplitude. According to Bloch’s theorem, crystal momentum $k$ is defined modulo any reciprocal lattice vector $G$, where in one dimension $G = \\tfrac{2\\pi}{a}m$ with integer $m$, and the first Brillouin zone (BZ) is the interval $[-\\tfrac{\\pi}{a}, \\tfrac{\\pi}{a}]$.\n\nA two-particle umklapp process is a scattering event in which the sum of the incoming crystal momenta differs from the sum of the outgoing crystal momenta by a nonzero reciprocal lattice vector $G \\neq 0$. Focus on low-temperature scattering near the Fermi points $\\pm k_F$ and consider the specific backscattering channel in which two right-moving electrons near $+k_F$ scatter to two left-moving electrons near $-k_F$.\n\nStarting only from the principles of Bloch’s theorem, the definition of the Brillouin zone, conservation of crystal momentum modulo reciprocal lattice vectors, and state counting in $k$-space with spin degeneracy, derive the condition on $k_F$ under which the described umklapp process is allowed by crystal momentum conservation. Then, using particle-number counting to relate $k_F$ to the electron density per site $n$ (electrons per lattice site, including both spins), specialize to half-filling $n = 1$ and compute the threshold value of the Fermi wavevector $k_F^{(\\mathrm{th})}$ at which umklapp processes first become allowed.

Express your final answer in units of inverse length. Do not introduce any numerical approximations.", "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a canonical scenario in condensed matter physics and all provided information is consistent and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the threshold Fermi wavevector $k_F^{(\\mathrm{th})}$ at which a specific two-particle umklapp scattering process becomes kinematically allowed. The process involves two electrons with initial crystal momenta $k_1$ and $k_2$ scattering into two final states with momenta $k_3$ and $k_4$.\n\nAccording to Bloch's theorem, crystal momentum is conserved modulo a reciprocal lattice vector $G$. For a two-particle scattering event, this conservation law is expressed as:\n$$k_1 + k_2 = k_3 + k_4 + G$$\nwhere $G = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}m$ for some integer $m$. A normal process corresponds to $G=0$ ($m=0$), while an umklapp process corresponds to $G \\neq 0$ ($m \\neq 0$).\n\nThe problem specifies a backscattering channel where two right-moving electrons near the positive Fermi point $+k_F$ scatter into two left-moving electrons near the negative Fermi point $-k_F$. At low temperatures, the occupied states (the Fermi sea) are those with crystal momenta $|k| \\le k_F$, and unoccupied states are those with $|k|  k_F$. The initial states must therefore be occupied, and the final states must be unoccupied.\n\nFor the specified channel:\n- The initial momenta are $k_1, k_2 \\approx +k_F$. Since these are occupied states, we must have $k_1 \\le k_F$ and $k_2 \\le k_F$.\n- The final momenta are $k_3, k_4 \\approx -k_F$. Since these must be available (unoccupied) final states, the scattering must place the electrons outside the Fermi sea. However, the problem simplifies the picture by describing the final states as \"near $-k_F$\", which in the context of backscattering implies states with momenta $k \\approx -k_F$. To satisfy both momentum conservation and the Pauli exclusion principle, the final states must be just outside the Fermi sea, e.g., $k_3  -k_F$ and $k_4  -k_F$.\n\nLet's analyze the kinematics. The total momentum of the initial pair is $K_{\\mathrm{in}} = k_1 + k_2$. The maximum value for $K_{\\mathrm{in}}$ occurs when both electrons are at the Fermi surface, i.e., $k_1 = k_2 = k_F$. Thus, the maximum initial momentum is $K_{\\mathrm{in, max}} = 2k_F$.\nThe total momentum of the final pair is $K_{\\mathrm{out}} = k_3 + k_4$. The minimum value for $K_{\\mathrm{out}}$ occurs when the scattered electrons occupy states just at the negative Fermi surface, i.e., $k_3 = k_4 = -k_F$. Thus, the minimum final momentum is $K_{\\mathrm{out, min}} = -2k_F$.\n\nThe momentum conservation law can be rewritten as $k_1 + k_2 - (k_3 + k_4) = G$. For an umklapp process to be possible, the range of possible values for the momentum transfer on the left-hand side must be able to span a non-zero reciprocal lattice vector $G$. The maximum possible momentum transfer is:\n$$\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{max}} = K_{\\mathrm{in, max}} - K_{\\mathrm{out, min}} = (2k_F) - (-2k_F) = 4k_F$$\nAn umklapp process becomes kinematically possible if this maximum momentum transfer is at least as large as the smallest possible non-zero magnitude of a reciprocal lattice vector. The reciprocal lattice vectors are $G_m = \\frac{2\\pi m}{a}$ for integer $m$. The smallest non-zero magnitude is for $m = \\pm 1$:\n$$|G|_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$$\nTherefore, the condition for the umklapp process to be allowed is:\n$$4k_F \\ge \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$k_F \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$$\nThe threshold value of the Fermi wavevector, $k_F^{(\\mathrm{th})}$, is the minimum value of $k_F$ for which this process is possible. This occurs when the inequality is first satisfied, which is at the equality:\n$$k_F^{(\\mathrm{th})} = \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$$\n\nThe problem also asks to relate this to the electron density per site, $n$, at half-filling. We can determine the relationship between $n$ and $k_F$ by counting the number of states. In a one-dimensional crystal of length $L = Na$ with $N$ sites, the allowed values of $k$ under periodic boundary conditions are separated by $\\Delta k = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}$. The density of states in $k$-space is $\\frac{1}{\\Delta k} = \\frac{L}{2\\pi}$.\nThe electrons fill the states in the interval $[-k_F, k_F]$. The number of available orbitals in this interval is the length of the interval, $2k_F$, multiplied by the density of states:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{orbitals}} = (2k_F) \\times \\frac{L}{2\\pi} = \\frac{k_F L}{\\pi}$$\nSince each electron is a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ fermion, each orbital can hold two electrons (spin up and spin down). The total number of electrons $N_{e}$ is:\n$$N_{e} = 2 \\times N_{\\mathrm{orbitals}} = \\frac{2k_F L}{\\pi}$$\nThe electron density per site, $n$, is the total number of electrons divided by the number of lattice sites, $N$:\n$$n = \\frac{N_{e}}{N} = \\frac{2k_F L}{N\\pi} = \\frac{2k_F (Na)}{N\\pi} = \\frac{2k_F a}{\\pi}$$\nFrom this, we can express $k_F$ in terms of $n$:\n$$k_F = \\frac{n\\pi}{2a}$$\nAt half-filling, the electron density is $n=1$, meaning there is one electron per lattice site. Substituting $n=1$ into the expression for $k_F$:\n$$k_F(\\text{at } n=1) = \\frac{(1)\\pi}{2a} = \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$$\nThis result shows that the Fermi wavevector at half-filling is precisely equal to the threshold value $k_F^{(\\mathrm{th})}$ at which umklapp processes of this type first become allowed. For any filling $n  1$, we have $k_F  \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$, which means $4k_F  \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$, and umklapp scattering is forbidden. At $n=1$, umklapp scattering becomes possible.\n\nThe location of the first Brillouin zone boundary is at $k = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{a}$. The threshold wavevector $k_F^{(\\mathrm{th})} = \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$ corresponds to the Fermi sea filling exactly half of the first Brillouin zone, from $-\\frac{\\pi}{2a}$ to $+\\frac{\\pi}{2a}$.\n\nThe threshold value of the Fermi wavevector as requested is $k_F^{(\\mathrm{th})}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2a}}\n$$", "id": "2972321"}, {"introduction": "While Umklapp scattering arises from particle interactions, resistance in real materials is also ubiquitously caused by backscattering from static disorder. This process, which reverses an electron's momentum, is most effective when the disorder potential has strong Fourier components at a momentum transfer of $q=2k_F$. This practice offers a concrete calculation of the backscattering strength for a common and powerful model of disorder, the Gaussian white-noise potential.
