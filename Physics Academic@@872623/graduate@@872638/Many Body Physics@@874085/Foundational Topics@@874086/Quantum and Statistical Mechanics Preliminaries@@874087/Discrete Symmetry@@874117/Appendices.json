The problem statement asserts that the SSH model has chiral symmetry, which means $\\{\\mathcal{C}, H_{SSH}\\} = 0$. Let's briefly verify this. The operator $\\mathcal{C}$ can be written as $\\mathcal{C} = P_A - P_B$, where $P_A$ and $P_B$ are projectors onto the A and B sublattices, respectively. Any hopping term in $H_{SSH}$ connects a site from sublattice A to a site in sublattice B. This means $H_{SSH}$ is purely off-diagonal in the sublattice basis, i.e., $P_A H_{SSH} P_A = 0$ and $P_B H_{SSH} P_B = 0$.\nSo, $H_{SSH} = P_A H_{SSH} P_B + P_B H_{SSH} P_A$.\nNow, we compute the product $\\mathcal{C}H_{SSH}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{C}H_{SSH} = (P_A - P_B)(P_A H_{SSH} P_B + P_B H_{SSH} P_A) = P_A^2 H_{SSH} P_B - P_B P_A H_{SSH} P_B + P_A P_B H_{SSH} P_A - P_B^2 H_{SSH} P_A $$\nUsing $P_\\alpha^2 = P_\\alpha$ and $P_\\alpha P_\\beta = 0$ for $\\alpha \\neq \\beta$, we get:\n$$ \\mathcal{C}H_{SSH} = P_A H_{SSH} P_B - P_B H_{SSH} P_A $$\nSimilarly, for $H_{SSH}\\mathcal{C}$:\n$$ H_{SSH}\\mathcal{C} = (P_A H_{SSH} P_B + P_B H_{SSH} P_A)(P_A - P_B) = - P_A H_{SSH} P_B^2 + P_B H_{SSH} P_A^2 = -P_A H_{SSH} P_B + P_B H_{SSH} P_A $$\nAdding these two results:\n$$ \\{\\mathcal{C}, H_{SSH}\\} = (P_A H_{SSH} P_B - P_B H_{SSH} P_A) + (-P_A H_{SSH} P_B + P_B H_{SSH} P_A) = 0 $$\nSo, the first part of the anti-commutator is indeed zero.\n\nNext, let's analyze the term $\\{\\mathcal{C}, H_{V}\\}$. The staggered potential is given by:\n$$ H_{V} = V \\sum_{j=1}^N (c_{j,A}^\\dagger c_{j,A} - c_{j,B}^\\dagger c_{j,B}) $$\nWe can see that this is directly proportional to the chiral operator $\\mathcal{C}$:\n$$ H_{V} = V \\mathcal{C} $$\nNow we compute the anti-commutator of $\\mathcal{C}$ with $H_V$:\n$$ \\{\\mathcal{C}, H_{V}\\} = \\{\\mathcal{C}, V\\mathcal{C}\\} = V \\{\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{C}\\} $$\nThe anti-commutator of an operator with itself is:\n$$ \\{\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{C}\\} = \\mathcal{C}\\mathcal{C} + \\mathcal{C}\\mathcal{C} = 2\\mathcal{C}^2 $$\nThe chiral operator $\\mathcal{C}$ assigns $+1$ to states on sublattice A and $-1$ to states on sublattice B. Therefore, applying it twice squares these eigenvalues, resulting in $(+1)^2=1$ and $(-1)^2=1$. This means $\\mathcal{C}^2$ is the identity operator, $I$.\nSo, we have:\n$$ \\{\\mathcal{C}, H_{V}\\} = 2V\\mathcal{C}^2 = 2VI $$\n\nFinally, we combine the results to find the anti-commutator for the full Hamiltonian:\n$$ \\{\\mathcal{C}, H\\} = \\{\\mathcal{C}, H_{SSH}\\} + \\{\\mathcal{C}, H_{V}\\} = 0 + 2VI = 2VI $$\nSince the potential strength $V$ is non-zero, the anti-commutator $\\{\\mathcal{C}, H\\} = 2VI$ is also non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the full Hamiltonian $H = H_{SSH} + H_{V}$ does not anti-commute with the chiral operator $\\mathcal{C}$.
