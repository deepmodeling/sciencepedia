The problem specifies a spin-singlet state, which is antisymmetric: $\\chi_{\\text{singlet}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle - |\\downarrow\\uparrow\\rangle)$.

The symmetric spatial wavefunction can be constructed as the product of single-particle solutions:\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{spatial}}(x_1, x_2) = \\psi_E(x_1) \\psi_E(x_2)\n$$\nwhere $\\psi_E(x)$ is the solution to the single-particle Schrödinger equation with energy $E$.\n\n### Step 2: Joint Reflection Probability\n\nLet the single-particle scattering state have the asymptotic form for a particle incident from the left:\n$$\n\\psi_E(x) \\to e^{ikx} + r e^{-ikx} \\quad \\text{for } x \\to -\\infty\n$$\nHere, $k = \\sqrt{2mE}/\\hbar$ is the wave number and $r$ is the single-particle reflection amplitude.
