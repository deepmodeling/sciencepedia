Perturbation series in quantum mechanics are often asymptotic, and their large-order behavior contains information about non-perturbative phenomena like tunneling, which are invisible at any finite order of the expansion. By applying the steepest descent approximation to a dispersion relation integral, one can extract the growth rate of the perturbative coefficients, as demonstrated in this problem on the Stark effect [@problem_id:1217566].

This divergence is related to the fact that the electric field creates a potential barrier through which the electron can tunnel, making the ground state a resonance with a finite lifetime.\n\nThe ionization rate $\\Gamma$ of the atom is related to the imaginary part of the energy.
