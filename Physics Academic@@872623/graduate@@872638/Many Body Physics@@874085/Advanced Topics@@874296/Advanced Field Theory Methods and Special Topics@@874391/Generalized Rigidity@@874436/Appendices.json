This problem investigates the rigidity of the 3-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with respect to its entanglement witness value under two-body perturbations.\n\nA 3-qubit GHZ state is defined as $|\\text{GHZ}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|000\\rangle + |111\\rangle)$. The corresponding density matrix is $\\rho_{\\text{GHZ}} = |\\text{GHZ}\\rangle\\langle\\text{GHZ}|$.\n\nAn entanglement witness is a Hermitian operator $W$ that can distinguish some entangled states from all separable states.
