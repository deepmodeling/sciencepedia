This equality implies that their symmetric parts (with respect to indices $i,j$) must also be equal: $L^S_{ij,k} = L^S_{k,ij}$.\nLet's compute $L^S_{ij,k}$ from the expression for $L_{ij,k}$:\n$$\nL^S_{ij,k} = \\frac{1}{2}(L_{ij,k} + L_{ji,k})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $L_{ij,k}$:\n$$\nL_{ji,k} = \\alpha_2 n_i \\delta_{jk} + \\alpha_3 n_j \\delta_{ik}\n$$\nSo,\n$$\nL^S_{ij,k} = \\frac{1}{2} [(\\alpha_2 n_j \\delta_{ik} + \\alpha_3 n_i \\delta_{jk}) + (\\alpha_2 n_i \\delta_{jk} + \\alpha_3 n_j \\delta_{ik})]\n$$\n$$\nL^S_{ij,k} = \\frac{\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3}{2} (n_j \\delta_{ik} + n_i \\delta_{jk})\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Derive the relation and compute the final expression**\nNow we equate the two expressions for the symmetric parts of the kinetic coefficients:\n$$\nL^S_{ij,k} = L^S_{k,ij}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3}{2} (n_j \\delta_{ik} + n_i \\delta_{jk}) = \\frac{\\gamma_2}{2} (n_j \\delta_{ik} + n_i \\delta_{jk})\n$$\nThis equality must hold for any director orientation $\\mathbf{n}$.
