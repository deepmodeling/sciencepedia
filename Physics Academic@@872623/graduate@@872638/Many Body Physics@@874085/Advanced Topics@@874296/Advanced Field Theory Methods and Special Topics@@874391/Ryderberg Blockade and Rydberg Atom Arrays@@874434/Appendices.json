A key operation involves a two-qubit quantum gate, which is implemented by exciting a pair of atoms to a highly excited Rydberg state. When two atoms are simultaneously in this state, they interact via a van der Waals potential. For the specific Rydberg state used, this interaction potential energy $V(R)$ as a function of the inter-atomic distance $R$ is well-approximated by $V(R) = C_6 / R^6$.\n\nThe process of exciting an atom from its ground state to the Rydberg state is driven by a laser with a characteristic coupling strength, described by the Rabi frequency $\\Omega$. A crucial phenomenon known as the 'Rydberg blockade' occurs when the interaction energy between two atoms becomes strong enough to shift the atomic transition out of resonance with the driving laser.
