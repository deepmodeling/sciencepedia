All definitions and relationships are consistent with established theory. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution can be constructed directly from the provided definitions.\n\nThe task is to derive the relationship between the electronic filling factor $\\nu$ and the composite fermion filling factor $\\nu^{*}$, and then apply it to specific cases. We are given the following definitions:\n1.  The electronic filling factor: $\\nu = \\frac{n_{e}\\phi_{0}}{B}$, where $n_{e}$ is the electron number density, $\\phi_{0} = h/e$ is the magnetic flux quantum, and $B$ is the external magnetic field.\n2.

The flux is parallel to $B$, leading to a reduced effective field.\n3.  The composite fermion filling factor: $\\nu^{*} = \\frac{n_{e}\\phi_{0}}{B^{*}}$.\n\nOur first goal is to derive the mapping between $\\nu$ and $\\nu^{*}$. We can achieve this by expressing $B$ and $B^{*}$ in terms of $\\nu$, $\\nu^{*}$, and other parameters, and then establishing a relationship between them.\n\nFrom the definition of $\\nu$, we can express the external magnetic field $B$ as:\n$$B = \\frac{n_{e}\\phi_{0}}{\\nu}$$\nSimilarly, from the definition of $\\nu^{*}$, we can express the effective magnetic field $B^{*}$ as:\n$$B^{*} = \\frac{n_{e}\\phi_{0}}{\\nu^{*}}$$\nNow, substitute these two expressions into the definition of the effective magnetic field, $B^{*} = B - 2p\\,n_{e}\\phi_{0}$:\n$$\\frac{n_{e}\\phi_{0}}{\\nu^{*}} = \\frac{n_{e}\\phi_{0}}{\\nu} - 2p\\,n_{e}\\phi_{0}$$\nThe term $n_{e}\\phi_{0}$ is common to all terms and is non-zero, so we can divide the entire equation by it:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\nu^{*}} = \\frac{1}{\\nu} - 2p$$\nThis equation provides the general mapping between the inverse filling factors.

The relationship becomes:\n$$\\nu^{*} = \\frac{\\nu}{1 - 2\\nu}$$\nWe need to compute the value of $\\nu^{*}$ for two given electronic filling factors, $\\nu = 2/5$ and $\\nu = 3/7$.\n\nFor $\\nu = 2/5$:\n$$\\nu^{*} = \\frac{2/5}{1 - 2(2/5)} = \\frac{2/5}{1 - 4/5} = \\frac{2/5}{1/5} = 2$$\nThus, for an electronic filling factor of $\\nu=2/5$, the composite fermion filling factor is $\\nu^{*}=2$.\n\nFor $\\nu = 3/7$:\n$$\\nu^{*} = \\frac{3/7}{1 - 2(3/7)} = \\frac{3/7}{1 - 6/7} = \\frac{3/7}{1/7} = 3$$\nThus, for an electronic filling factor of $\\nu=3/7$, the composite fermion filling factor is $\\nu^{*}=3$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to predict the corresponding number of filled CF Landau levels for these two cases. The problem statement itself provides the rule: \"Composite fermions fill an integer number of CF Landau levels when $\\nu^{*}$ is an integer.\" Since our calculated values for $\\nu^{*}$ are integers in both cases, the value of $\\nu^{*}$ directly corresponds to the number of filled CF Landau levels.\nFor $\\nu = 2/5$, we found $\\nu^{*} = 2$, which implies that the composite fermions completely fill $2$ Landau levels.\nFor $\\nu = 3/7$, we found $\\nu^{*} = 3$, which implies that the composite fermions completely fill $3$ Landau levels.\n\nThe problem asks for the final pair of answers $(\\nu^{*}\\text{ at }\\nu=2/5,\\ \\nu^{*}\\text{ at }\\nu=3/7)$ as a row vector.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n#### 1) Derivation of the Shift $\\mathcal{S}$\n\nThe total number of electrons, $N_e$, must equal the total number of available states in the $n$ filled Landau levels for the composite fermions. The number of states in each level $k$ is given by its degeneracy $g_k$.\n\nThe total number of electrons is the sum of the degeneracies of the filled CF Landau levels:\n$$\nN_e = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} g_k = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\left[ 2(Q^{\\star} + k) + 1 \\right]\n$$\nWe can split the sum:\n$$\nN_e = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2Q^{\\star} + 1) + 2 \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k\n$$\nThe first term is a sum of $n$ identical terms, and the second is the sum of an arithmetic series:\n$$\nN_e = n(2Q^{\\star} + 1) + 2 \\left( \\frac{(n-1)n}{2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nN_e = 2nQ^{\\star} + n + n(n-1) = 2nQ^{\\star} + n + n^2 - n\n$$\n$$\nN_e = 2nQ^{\\star} + n^2\n$$\nThis equation relates the number of electrons $N_e$ to the effective monopole strength $Q^{\\star}$ and the number of filled CF levels $n$. We can rearrange it to express $2Q^{\\star}$:\n$$\n2Q^{\\star} = \\frac{N_e - n^2}{n} = \\frac{N_e}{n} - n\n$$\nNow, we use the given flux attachment rule:\n$$\n2Q^{\\star} = 2Q - 2p(N_e - 1)\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $2Q^{\\star}$ we just derived:\n$$\n\\frac{N_e}{n} - n = 2Q - 2p(N_e - 1)\n$$\nWe need to find the shift $\\mathcal{S}$, which appears in the defining relation $2Q = \\nu^{-1}N_e - \\mathcal{S}$. To do this, we first solve the above equation for $2Q$:\n$$\n2Q = \\frac{N_e}{n} - n + 2p(N_e - 1)\n$$\n$$\n2Q = \\frac{N_e}{n} - n + 2pN_e - 2p\n$$\nGroup the terms proportional to $N_e$ and the constant terms:\n$$\n2Q = N_e \\left( \\frac{1}{n} + 2p \\right) - (n + 2p)\n$$\nLet's express the coefficient of $N_e$ with a common denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} + 2p = \\frac{1 + 2pn}{n}\n$$\nSo the expression for $2Q$ becomes:\n$$\n2Q = N_e \\left( \\frac{1 + 2pn}{n} \\right) - (n + 2p)\n$$\nWe now compare this result directly with the definition of the shift:\n$$\n2Q = \\nu^{-1} N_e - \\mathcal{S}\n$$\nBy matching the terms, we can identify $\\nu^{-1}$ and $\\mathcal{S}$:\n$$\n\\nu^{-1} = \\frac{1 + 2pn}{n} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\nu = \\frac{n}{1 + 2pn}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p\n$$\nThe derived filling factor $\\nu = \\frac{n}{2pn+1}$ perfectly matches the one given in the problem statement, which serves as a successful consistency check of the derivation. The closed-form expression for the shift is $\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p$.\n\n#### 2) Calculation of Specific Shifts\n\nWe use the derived formula $\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p$ and the given filling factors to find the integer parameters $n$ and $p$.\n\nFor $\\nu = \\dfrac{2}{5}$:\nWe match this to the general form $\\nu = \\dfrac{n}{2pn+1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{n}{2pn+1}\n$$\nBy inspection, setting the numerator $n=2$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2}{2p(2)+1} = \\frac{2}{4p+1}\n$$\nComparing the denominators, we have $5 = 4p+1$, which gives $4p=4$, so $p=1$.\nWith $n=2$ and $p=1$, the shift is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p = 2 + 2(1) = 4\n$$\n\nFor $\\nu = \\dfrac{3}{7}$:\nWe again match this to the general form:\n$$\n\\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{n}{2pn+1}\n$$\nBy inspection, setting the numerator $n=3$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{3}{2p(3)+1} = \\frac{3}{6p+1}\n$$\nComparing the denominators, we have $7 = 6p+1$, which gives $6p=6$, so $p=1$.\nWith $n=3$ and $p=1$, the shift is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p = 3 + 2(1) = 5\n$$\n\n#### 3) Verification of Consistency\n\nThe topological shift for a hierarchical or composite fermion quantum Hall state is generally understood to be additive. It consists of a contribution from the effective integer quantum Hall state of the quasiparticles (the composite fermions) and a contribution from the flux attachment procedure itself.\n\nThe standard expectation from the associated Chern-Simons field theory is $\\mathcal{S} = \\mathcal{S}_{\\text{IQHE}} + \\mathcal{S}_{\\text{flux}}$. For a state where composite fermions fill $n$ Landau levels, the integer quantum Hall part of the shift is $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{IQHE}} = n$. The flux attachment part, corresponding to binding $2p$ flux quanta to each electron, contributes $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{flux}} = 2p$.\nTherefore, the expected shift is $\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p$.\n\nOur derived expression $\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p$ is in exact agreement with this established theoretical expectation. The result correctly decomposes into a part $n$ depending on the number of filled CF Landau levels and a part $2p$ depending on the number of attached flux quanta. Our calculated values ($\\mathcal{S}=4$ for $\\nu=2/5$ and $\\mathcal{S}=5$ for $\\nu=3/7$) are therefore consistent with the known topological data for Jain sequence states.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4  5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2976554"}, {"introduction": "A successful theory must account not only for the ground state but also for its elementary excitations.

The filling fraction $\\nu=2/5$ corresponds to the Jain state with $n=2$ filled $\\Lambda$-levels and $p=1$ flux quantum attached to each electron. The relation between electron monopole strength $S_{GS}$ and CF monopole strength $S^*_{GS}$ for the ground state is:\n$$S_{GS} = S^*_{GS} + p(N-1) = S^*_{GS} + (N-1)$$\nIn the ground state, the $N$ CFs completely fill the lowest $n=2$ $\\Lambda$-levels. The number of available states in the $k$-th $\\Lambda$-level (with angular momentum $l_k = S^*_{GS}+k$) is $2l_k+1$.\nFor $n=2$, the levels are $k=0$ and $k=1$. The total number of CFs must equal the total number of states in these two levels:\n$$N = (2l_0+1) + (2l_1+1) = (2(S^*_{GS}+0)+1) + (2(S^*_{GS}+1)+1)$$\n$$N = (2S^*_{GS}+1) + (2S^*_{GS}+3) = 4S^*_{GS}+4$$\nFrom this, we can express the CF monopole strength for the ground state in terms of $N$:\n$$S^*_{GS} = \\frac{N-4}{4}$$\nThe ground state has fully filled shells of CFs, so its total angular momentum is $L_{GS}=0$.\n\n**2. Quasielectron State Configuration**\n\nA quasielectron state is formed by adding one flux quantum to the ground state. The new electron monopole strength $S_{qe}$ is related to the ground state one $S_{GS}$ by $2S_{qe} = 2S_{GS} + 1$.\nUsing the relation $S=S^*+p(N-1)$, we can find the new CF monopole strength $S^*_{qe}$:\n$$S_{qe} = S^*_{qe} + p(N-1) = S^*_{qe} + (N-1)$$\nWe must relate $S_{qe}$ to $S^*_{GS}$. We have:\n$$2S_{GS} = 2S^*_{GS} + 2p(N-1) = 2\\left(\\frac{N-4}{4}\\right) + 2(1)(N-1) = \\frac{N-4}{2} + 2N-2 = \\frac{N-4+4N-4}{2} = \\frac{5N-8}{2}$$\nThe flux for the quasielectron state is:\n$$2S_{qe} = 2S_{GS}+1 = \\frac{5N-8}{2} + 1 = \\frac{5N-6}{2}$$\nNow we find the new CF monopole strength $S^*_{qe}$:\n$$2S^*_{qe} = 2S_{qe} - 2p(N-1) = \\frac{5N-6}{2} - 2(1)(N-1) = \\frac{5N-6 - 4(N-1)}{2} = \\frac{5N-6-4N+4}{2} = \\frac{N-2}{2}$$\n$$S^*_{qe} = \\frac{N-2}{4}$$\n\n**3. CF Arrangement in the Quasielectron State**\n\nIn the quasielectron state, we have $N$ CFs subject to the effective monopole strength $S^*_{qe}$. We must determine how these $N$ CFs occupy the available $\\Lambda$-levels to form the lowest-energy state. The lowest energy is achieved by occupying the lowest available $\\Lambda$-levels.\nThe two lowest $\\Lambda$-levels have angular momenta:\n-   $k=0$: $l_0 = S^*_{qe} + 0 = \\frac{N-2}{4}$\n-   $k=1$: $l_1 = S^*_{qe} + 1 = \\frac{N-2}{4} + 1 = \\frac{N+2}{4}$\n\nThe number of available single-particle states in these levels are:\n-   $k=0$: $N_0^{\\text{states}} = 2l_0+1 = 2\\left(\\frac{N-2}{4}\\right) + 1 = \\frac{N-2}{2} + 1 = \\frac{N}{2}$\n-   $k=1$: $N_1^{\\text{states}} = 2l_1+1 = 2\\left(\\frac{N+2}{4}\\right) + 1 = \\frac{N+2}{2} + 1 = \\frac{N+4}{2} = \\frac{N}{2}+2$\n\nThe lowest energy configuration places as many CFs as possible in the lowest ($k=0$) $\\Lambda$-level. This level can hold exactly $N/2$ CFs.\nSo, we fill the $k=0$ level completely with $N_0 = N/2$ CFs.\nThe remaining $N_1 = N - N_0 = N - N/2 = N/2$ CFs are placed in the $k=1$ $\\Lambda$-level.\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Angular Momentum**\n\nThe total angular momentum of the electron state is identical to that of the CF state.\n-   The $k=0$ $\\Lambda$-level is completely filled, so its contribution to the total angular momentum is zero ($L_0=0$).\n-   The $k=1$ $\\Lambda$-level is partially filled. It has $N_1 = N/2$ CFs in $N_1^{\\text{states}} = N/2+2$ available states. This configuration is equivalent to having 2 holes in an otherwise filled shell. The angular momentum of this shell is $l_1 = (N+2)/4$.\n\nThe total angular momentum of the quasielectron state $L_{qe}$ is determined by the angular momentum of the two holes in the $l_1$ shell. The electrons are spin-polarized, so the CFs are treated as identical fermions. For two identical fermions in a shell with angular momentum $l_1$, the total two-particle wavefunction must be antisymmetric. Since the spin part is symmetric (both spins are aligned), the spatial part of the wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This restricts the possible values of the total orbital angular momentum $L$ to be odd integers.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the lowest-energy configuration for particles (or holes) with a repulsive interaction corresponds to the state with the maximum possible total angular momentum $L$. For two particles in a shell $l_1$, the maximum possible value of $L$ is $2l_1$ if the particles are distinguishable. For identical fermions, the maximum antisymmetric state has $L=2l_1-1$.\n\nThe total angular momentum of the quasielectron state is thus:\n$$L_{qe} = L_{\\text{max}} = 2l_1 - 1$$\nSubstituting the expression for $l_1$:\n$$L_{qe} = 2\\left(\\frac{N+2}{4}\\right) - 1$$\n$$L_{qe} = \\frac{N+2}{2} - 1 = \\frac{N+2-2}{2} = \\frac{N}{2}$$\nThe orbital angular momentum of the lowest-energy quasielectron excitation is $N/2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{N}{2}}$$", "id": "1112745"}]}
