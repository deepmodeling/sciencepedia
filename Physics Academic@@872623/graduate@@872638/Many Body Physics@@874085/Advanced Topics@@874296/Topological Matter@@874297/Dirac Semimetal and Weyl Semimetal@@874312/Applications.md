## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the fundamental principles and mechanisms governing Dirac and Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277), focusing on their unique band structures, topological invariants, and chiral nature. Having built this theoretical foundation, we now shift our focus to the practical and conceptual manifestations of these principles. This chapter explores the profound impact of Dirac and Weyl semimetals across a wide range of scientific disciplines, demonstrating how their abstract topological properties give rise to concrete, measurable phenomena and forge unexpected connections between disparate fields of physics.

We will begin by examining the key experimental signatures that allow for the definitive identification of these materials, connecting theoretical predictions to laboratory measurements. Subsequently, we will delve into the rich landscape of [anomalous transport](@entry_id:746472) phenomena, including effects driven by electric and magnetic fields, temperature gradients, and even mechanical rotation. We will then explore how these materials respond to external stimuli like light and mechanical strain, opening avenues for dynamically controlling their topological properties. Finally, we will venture to the interdisciplinary frontiers where the physics of Weyl semimetals intersects with high-energy physics, cosmology, superconductivity, and [quantum information science](@entry_id:150091), highlighting the role of these materials as a versatile platform for realizing exotic concepts and exploring new scientific paradigms.

### Hallmark Experimental Signatures

The theoretical prediction of a material as a Dirac or Weyl semimetal must ultimately be validated by experimental observation. The unique electronic structure, characterized by bulk Dirac or Weyl cones and topologically protected [surface states](@entry_id:137922), produces a set of distinctive signatures that can be detected using modern condensed matter probes.

#### Surface Probes: The Fermi Arc

Perhaps the most celebrated and definitive hallmark of a Weyl semimetal is the existence of topologically protected surface states known as Fermi arcs. As mandated by the [bulk-boundary correspondence](@entry_id:137647), the non-[trivial topology](@entry_id:154009) of the bulk electronic structure requires the presence of gapless states on the material's surface. Unlike the closed Fermi surfaces of conventional metals or the single-point Fermi surface of surface Dirac cones, the Fermi surface of these states forms an open, unclosed contour. This "Fermi arc" is a line segment of [electronic states](@entry_id:171776) at the Fermi energy that terminates at the surface projections of two bulk Weyl nodes of opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105).

The definitive technique for visualizing these states is Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES). By measuring the kinetic energy and momentum of photo-emitted electrons, ARPES directly maps the electronic band structure. In an ARPES experiment on a Weyl semimetal, the observation of an unclosed line segment in the constant-energy contour at the Fermi level provides compelling evidence of a Fermi arc. This feature is fundamentally distinct from the closed loops characteristic of conventional surface or bulk states and serves as a direct visualization of the topological connection between bulk Weyl nodes. [@problem_id:1827872]

#### Bulk Probes: Quantum Oscillations and the Berry Phase

While surface probes reveal the consequences of the bulk topology, magneto-transport and magnetization measurements can directly probe the properties of the bulk charge carriers. When a strong magnetic field is applied to a metal or semimetal at low temperatures, the continuous electronic energy levels coalesce into discrete, quantized Landau levels. As the magnetic field strength is varied, these Landau levels cross the Fermi energy, leading to periodic oscillations in thermodynamic and transport properties, such as magnetization (the de Haas-van Alphen effect) or [resistivity](@entry_id:266481) (the Shubnikov-de Haas effect).

These [quantum oscillations](@entry_id:142355) serve as a powerful tool for characterizing Dirac and Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277). First, in a conventional sense, the frequency of these oscillations in inverse magnetic field, $1/B$, is directly proportional to the extremal cross-sectional area of the Fermi surface perpendicular to the field. By measuring the oscillation frequency as a function of the magnetic field orientation, one can perform "Fermi-surface [tomography](@entry_id:756051)" to map out the size and shape of the Fermi pockets surrounding the Dirac or Weyl nodes. For a simple isotropic pocket, analysis of the oscillation period allows for a direct determination of the Fermi [wavevector](@entry_id:178620), $k_F$. [@problem_id:1827869]

More profoundly, the phase of these oscillations carries a direct signature of the [band topology](@entry_id:182035). The [semiclassical quantization](@entry_id:180422) of cyclotron orbits is modified by a [geometric phase](@entry_id:138449) known as the Berry phase, $\phi_B$. For conventional electrons with a quadratic dispersion, this phase is zero. However, for Dirac or Weyl fermions, which possess a linear dispersion, any closed path in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936) that encloses a node accumulates a non-trivial Berry phase of $\pi$. This [topological phase](@entry_id:146448) can be experimentally measured by analyzing the Landau fan diagram, where the integer indices of oscillation extrema are plotted against the corresponding $1/B$ values. The intercept of this plot at $1/B \to 0$ is directly related to the Berry phase. The measurement of an intercept corresponding to a $\pi$ Berry phase (after accounting for other phase contributions like the Maslov index) provides unambiguous evidence of the existence of Dirac or Weyl points within the Fermi surface. [@problem_id:2870310]

### Anomalous Transport Phenomena

The unique combination of chiral fermions and non-trivial Berry curvature in Dirac and Weyl semimetals gives rise to a host of unconventional transport phenomena that are absent in ordinary materials.

#### Chiral Anomaly and Negative Longitudinal Magnetoresistance

One of the most striking transport signatures is the [negative longitudinal magnetoresistance](@entry_id:146729) (LMR), a decrease in [electrical resistance](@entry_id:138948) when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the direction of current flow. This counter-intuitive behavior is a direct manifestation of the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077), a fundamental concept originally from high-energy physics.

In a Weyl semimetal with parallel electric ($E$) and magnetic ($B$) fields, a continuous "pumping" of charge occurs between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. This process generates an imbalance in the populations of left- and right-handed fermions. This imbalance is not limitless; it is counteracted by [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) processes that tend to restore equilibrium over a [characteristic time scale](@entry_id:274321), $\tau_a$. In the steady state, a non-zero chiral chemical potential, $\mu_5$, is established. This chiral imbalance, in turn, drives an anomalous current parallel to the magnetic field via the [chiral magnetic effect](@entry_id:143193). The magnitude of this anomalous current is proportional to $\mu_5$ and $B$, and since $\mu_5$ itself is proportional to $E \cdot B$, the total anomalous current scales with $E B^2$. This provides an additional channel for conduction that grows with the magnetic field strength, resulting in a positive longitudinal magnetoconductivity, $\Delta\sigma \propto B^2$, which is observed as a [negative magnetoresistance](@entry_id:136874). This effect is a unique fingerprint of chiral fermions in the bulk of a Weyl semimetal. [@problem_id:1827825] [@problem_id:1122852]

#### Anomalous Hall and Nernst Effects

The Berry curvature, which acts as a momentum-space magnetic field, imparts an "[anomalous velocity](@entry_id:146502)" to Bloch electrons, transverse to an applied electric field. In a time-reversal broken Weyl semimetal, where the Weyl nodes are separated in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936), the net Berry curvature integrated over the occupied states can be non-zero. This leads to a finite Hall conductivity even in the absence of an external magnetic field—the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). The magnitude of the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is directly proportional to the momentum-space separation of the Weyl nodes, serving as a powerful electrical probe of this key band-structure parameter. [@problem_id:1122840]

This topological influence extends beyond purely electrical transport into the domain of [thermoelectricity](@entry_id:142802). According to the Mott relation, which connects electrical and [thermoelectric transport](@entry_id:147600) coefficients, a material with a non-zero anomalous Hall conductivity will also exhibit a transverse thermoelectric response known as the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). In the ANE, a longitudinal temperature gradient generates a transverse heat and charge current. The off-diagonal Peltier coefficient, which quantifies this effect, can be derived directly from the energy dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity. This establishes a deep connection between the [quantum geometry](@entry_id:147695) of the electronic wavefunctions, electrical transport, and [thermal transport](@entry_id:198424). [@problem_id:1122814]

#### Relativistic Quantum Phenomena: Klein Tunneling

The description of low-energy quasiparticles in Dirac and Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) as massless chiral fermions is not merely a mathematical analogy; it leads to the manifestation of phenomena from relativistic quantum mechanics in a solid-state setting. A prime example is Klein tunneling.

In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, a particle has an exponentially small probability of tunneling through a [potential barrier](@entry_id:147595) that is higher than its kinetic energy. In stark contrast, a chiral fermion, such as an electron in a Weyl semimetal, can exhibit perfect, unity-transmission through an arbitrarily high and wide potential barrier, provided it is incident normal to the barrier. This perfect transmission arises because the reflection of a chiral particle would require it to flip its [chirality](@entry_id:144105), a process which is forbidden in the low-energy effective theory. This remarkable property, which has profound implications for electronic device applications, is a direct consequence of the material's relativistic-like energy dispersion and the conservation of [chirality](@entry_id:144105). [@problem_id:1827859]

### Optical and Nonlinear Responses

The interaction of light with Dirac and Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) reveals further evidence of their unique electronic structure and offers avenues for optical applications and the study of [nonlinear physics](@entry_id:187625).

#### Linear Optical Conductivity

The [linear dispersion relation](@entry_id:266313), $E = \pm \hbar v_F |\mathbf{k}|$, leaves a distinct fingerprint on the material's optical [absorption spectrum](@entry_id:144611). When a photon is absorbed, it excites an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. The rate of this process, quantified by the real part of the [optical conductivity](@entry_id:139437), $\sigma_1(\omega)$, depends on the density of available initial and final states. For a 3D linear dispersion, a phase-space analysis shows that the density of joint states available for a transition of energy $\hbar\omega$ scales as $\omega^2$. After accounting for a prefactor of $1/\omega$ from the Kubo formula, the interband [optical conductivity](@entry_id:139437) is found to have a characteristic linear dependence on frequency: $\sigma_1(\omega) \propto \omega$. This linear dependence distinguishes Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) from conventional gapped semiconductors (where absorption begins at the gap edge) and 2D graphene (where the conductivity is frequency-independent). Detailed calculations yield a universal expression for the conductivity of a single Weyl cone, dependent only on frequency and fundamental constants. [@problem_id:1827851] [@problem_id:1122785]

#### Nonlinear Optical and Hall Effects

While linear responses are dominant, the non-[trivial topology](@entry_id:154009) and specific crystal symmetries of Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) can give rise to significant nonlinear effects. For instance, in Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) that lack [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948) but preserve time-reversal symmetry, the application of an electric field can induce a second-order Hall current, $j_a \propto E_b E_c$. This nonlinear Hall effect does not rely on a magnetic field and originates from a non-zero "Berry curvature dipole" in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). The Berry curvature dipole quantifies the momentum-space distribution of Berry curvature and is only present when inversion symmetry is broken. This effect represents a new mechanism for frequency conversion and [rectification](@entry_id:197363) and provides a sensitive probe of [crystal symmetry](@entry_id:138731). [@problem_id:2870290] It is crucial to note that such effects are strictly governed by symmetry; for example, certain second-order photogalvanic effects, such as the shift current, can be strictly forbidden in systems that possess [time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094). [@problem_id:1122818]

### Engineering and Controlling Topological States

A particularly exciting frontier is the ability not just to discover, but to create and manipulate [topological phases of matter](@entry_id:144114) on demand. Dirac and Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) provide a fertile ground for such "topological engineering."

#### Floquet Engineering: Creating Weyl Points with Light

It is possible to dynamically induce a [topological phase transition](@entry_id:137214) in a conventional, topologically trivial material using light. A gapped band insulator, when irradiated with sufficiently intense, [circularly polarized light](@entry_id:198374), can be transformed into a so-called Floquet-Weyl semimetal. The [periodic driving](@entry_id:146581) field effectively modifies the [electronic band structure](@entry_id:136694), creating a quasi-[energy spectrum](@entry_id:181780). Under the right conditions, the light can effectively tune the material's mass term, closing the energy gap at specific points in the Brillouin zone. This process creates pairs of Weyl points whose existence and momentum-space location depend on the properties of the driving light, such as its intensity and polarization. This "Floquet engineering" offers a pathway to creating tunable topological states in a wide range of materials. [@problem_id:1827831]

#### Strain Engineering: Mechanical Control of Topology

Mechanical strain offers another powerful knob for controlling [topological properties](@entry_id:154666). The coupling between the crystal lattice and the electronic wavefunctions means that deforming the material can directly alter the Hamiltonian.

In a simple scenario, applying a uniform uniaxial strain can shift the positions of existing Weyl nodes in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). This provides a direct mechanical means to tune transport properties, such as the anomalous Hall conductivity, which depends on the node separation. [@problem_id:1122781]

More complex, spatially inhomogeneous strain fields can lead to even more exotic physics. A non-uniform strain can generate an effective, or "pseudo," [gauge field](@entry_id:193054) that couples to the Weyl fermions. This axial vector potential acts oppositely on fermions of opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105). A suitably engineered strain texture can produce a uniform pseudo-magnetic field, $\mathbf{B}_5$, even in the complete absence of any real external magnetic field. This pseudo-magnetic field can quantize the electronic energy spectrum into "pseudo-Landau levels," analogous to the conventional Landau levels from a real magnetic field. This purely mechanical induction of Landau quantization opens the door to studying quantum Hall-like physics without magnets and gives rise to novel transport phenomena, such as a strain-induced anomalous Nernst effect. [@problem_id:2870327] [@problem_id:1122804]

### Interdisciplinary Frontiers and Advanced Topics

The concepts underpinning Dirac and Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) resonate far beyond traditional [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) physics, connecting to high-energy theory, materials science, and quantum information.

#### Connections to High-Energy Physics and Cosmology

The low-energy theory of Weyl fermions in a crystal lattice provides a remarkable tabletop platform for studying phenomena first conceptualized in the context of particle physics and cosmology.

*   **Axion Electrodynamics:** The effective electromagnetic response in certain [topological materials](@entry_id:142123) is described by [axion electrodynamics](@entry_id:144423), which includes a topological $\theta$-term coupling the electric and magnetic fields. A key prediction of this theory is the Witten effect, where a [magnetic monopole](@entry_id:149129) induces an electric charge proportional to the [axion angle](@entry_id:139420) $\theta$. Dirac and Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) can realize this physics, where a hypothetical [magnetic monopole](@entry_id:149129) placed inside the material would bind a real electric charge from the electron liquid, providing a [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) analogue of this fundamental high-energy concept. [@problem_id:1239167]

*   **Chiral Vortical Effect:** Just as parallel electric and magnetic fields generate a charge current (the [chiral magnetic effect](@entry_id:143193)), a rotating fluid of chiral fermions will generate a current parallel to the axis of rotation. This chiral vortical effect, first discussed in the context of quark-[gluon](@entry_id:159508) plasmas and the early universe, can manifest in a physically rotating Weyl semimetal. The resulting particle current depends on the temperature and chemical potentials of the Weyl nodes, linking the [quantum topology](@entry_id:158206) of the material to its macroscopic [hydrodynamics](@entry_id:158871). [@problem_id:1122833]

*   **Gravitational Analogs:** The deep connection between geometry and electronic properties extends to analogues of general relativity. In some theoretical models, the fermions in a Dirac semimetal can couple to the torsion of a background spacetime. A constant axial torsion field, for example, can act to split a single Dirac point into a pair of Weyl points, thereby inducing a Weyl semimetal phase and its associated anomalous Hall effect. This illustrates how concepts from differential geometry and [gravitation](@entry_id:189550) can find concrete realizations in the [band structure](@entry_id:139379) of electronic materials. [@problem_id:1076596]

#### Topological Superconductivity and Quantum Computing

The interface between [topological semimetals](@entry_id:137800) and superconductors is a particularly rich area of research with potential applications in [quantum computation](@entry_id:142712).

When a Dirac or Weyl semimetal is brought into proximity with a conventional superconductor, Cooper pairs can tunnel into the semimetal. The resulting hybrid system can host exotic Andreev [bound states](@entry_id:136502), and the unique properties of the semimetal, such as the high transparency of its charge carriers due to Klein tunneling, can lead to unusual Josephson effects with distinctive current-phase relationships. [@problem_id:1122816]

Even more exciting is the prospect of engineering [topological superconductivity](@entry_id:141300). By interfacing a Weyl semimetal with a suitable superconductor (e.g., a $p$-wave superconductor), it is theoretically possible to create and stabilize Majorana fermions. These enigmatic particles are their own [antiparticles](@entry_id:155666) and obey non-Abelian statistics, making them ideal building blocks for fault-tolerant topological quantum computers. In such a hybrid system, Majorana modes can appear as a flat-band "Majorana arc" connecting the projections of the Weyl nodes on the surface, representing a new type of topologically protected zero-energy state. [@problem_id:1122817]

#### Quantum Information and Entanglement

The topological nature of a [quantum state of matter](@entry_id:196883) is also encoded in its entanglement properties. The entanglement entropy of a spatial region in a quantum many-body ground state typically scales with the area of its boundary (an "[area law](@entry_id:145931)"). For gapless systems like Weyl semimetals, there are universal logarithmic corrections to this area law. For a region with sharp corners, the coefficient of the logarithmic term is universal and depends only on the geometry of the corners and the number of Weyl nodes. This provides a connection between the macroscopic geometry of a region and the microscopic [topological charge](@entry_id:142322) of the system's fundamental excitations, linking the field of topological materials to [quantum information theory](@entry_id:141608). [@problem_id:1122820]
