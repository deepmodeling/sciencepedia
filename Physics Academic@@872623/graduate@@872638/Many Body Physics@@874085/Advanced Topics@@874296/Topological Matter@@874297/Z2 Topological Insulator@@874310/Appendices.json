Insulator Condition**\nThe energy eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are given by $E_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{k})$. The Fermi energy is fixed at $E_F=0$. The system is an insulator if there is a finite energy gap between the valence band ($E_-$) and the conduction band ($E_+$) for all wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$ in the Brillouin zone. The direct band gap is given by:\n$$\nE_{gap}(\\mathbf{k}) = E_+(\\mathbf{k}) - E_-(\\mathbf{k}) = 2\\sqrt{d_x(\\mathbf{k})^2 + d_y(\\mathbf{k})^2 + d_z(\\mathbf{k})^2}\n$$\nA gap exists if and only if $E_{gap}(\\mathbf{k}) > 0$ for all $\\mathbf{k}$. This is equivalent to the condition that the vector $\\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k}) = (d_x(\\mathbf{k}), d_y(\\mathbf{k}), d_z(\\mathbf{k}))$ never vanishes.\n\nFor the numerical evaluation, we discretize the Brillouin zone $[-\\pi, \\pi] \\times [-\\pi, \\pi]$ into a uniform $N \\times N$ grid of points. We compute $E_{gap}(\\mathbf{k})$ at each grid point and find the minimum value, $E_{gap, min}$. According to the problem specification, if $E_{gap, min} \\le 10^{-9}$, the system is considered a metal or semimetal, and the result for the case is $-1$. Otherwise, it is an insulator, and we proceed to the next step.\n\n**2. $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Invariant Calculation**\nFor an inversion-symmetric insulator, the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant $\\nu$ can be determined by the parities of the occupied energy bands at the Time-Reversal-Invariant Momenta (TRIM), $\\Lambda_i$. The formula is:\n$$\n(-1)^{\\nu} = \\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\xi_i\n$$\nwhere $\\xi_i$ is the product of the parity eigenvalues for the occupied Kramers pair at the TRIM $\\Lambda_i$. Since the two states in a Kramers pair have the same parity under inversion, we only need to find the parity of one of them.\n\nThe inversion operator is $P = \\sigma_z \\otimes s_0$. At a TRIM point $\\Lambda$, the components $d_x(\\Lambda) = A \\sin k_x$ and $d_y(\\Lambda) = A \\sin k_y$ are zero because the components of $\\Lambda$ are integer multiples of $\\pi$. The Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n$$\nH(\\Lambda) = d_z(\\Lambda) \\sigma_z \\otimes s_0\n$$\nThis Hamiltonian is diagonal in the basis of $\\sigma_z$ eigenstates. The orbital part of the Hamiltonian, $h(\\Lambda) = d_z(\\Lambda) \\sigma_z$, has eigenvalues $\\pm d_z(\\Lambda)$. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, which are also eigenstates of the parity operator $\\sigma_z$ with eigenvalues $+1$ and $-1$.\n\nThe occupied band has negative energy, $E_{occ}(\\Lambda) = -\\left|d_z(\\Lambda)\\right|$. We must determine the parity eigenvalue of the state corresponding to this energy.\n\n- If $d_z(\\Lambda) > 0$, the occupied energy is $-d_z(\\Lambda)$. The corresponding eigenvector of $\\sigma_z$ has eigenvalue $-1$. Thus, the parity $\\xi$ is $-1$.\n- If $d_z(\\Lambda)  0$, the occupied energy is $d_z(\\Lambda)$. The corresponding eigenvector of $\\sigma_z$ has eigenvalue $+1$. Thus, the parity $\\xi$ is $+1$.\n- If $d_z(\\Lambda) = 0$, the gap closes at this TRIM point, and the system is not an insulator. This case is already covered by the gap check.\n\nTherefore, the parity eigenvalue of the occupied band at a TRIM $\\Lambda$ is $\\xi(\\Lambda) = -\\text{sign}(d_z(\\Lambda))$. The $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant is then found by calculating the product of these parities over the four TRIMs: $\\Lambda_1=(0,0)$, $\\Lambda_2=(\\pi,0)$, $\\Lambda_3=(0,\\pi)$, $\\Lambda_4=(\\pi,\\pi)$.\n\n$$\n(-1)^{\\nu} = \\prod_{\\Lambda \\in \\text{TRIM}} \\left( -\\text{sign}(d_z(\\Lambda)) \\right) = \\prod_{\\Lambda \\in \\text{TRIM}} \\text{sign}(d_z(\\Lambda))\n$$\nThe value of $d_z(\\Lambda)$ at the TRIMs is:\n- $d_z(0,0) = M - 2B(2 - 1 - 1) = M$\n- $d_z(\\pi,0) = M - 2B(2 - (-1) - 1) = M - 4B$\n- $d_z(0,\\pi) = M - 2B(2 - 1 - (-1)) = M - 4B$\n- $d_z(\\pi,\\pi) = M - 2B(2 - (-1) - (-1)) = M - 8B$\n\nIf the final product $\\prod \\xi_i$ is $+1$, then $\\nu=0$ (trivial insulator). If the product is $-1$, then $\\nu=1$ (topological insulator).\n\nThis completes the theoretical basis for the algorithm to be implemented.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for the given test cases.\n    It calculates the Z2 invariant for a 2D tight-binding model.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: A=1.0, B=1.0, M=2.0, N=81\n        (1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 81),\n        # Case 2: A=1.0, B=1.0, M=10.0, N=41\n        (1.0, 1.0, 10.0, 41),\n        # Case 3: A=1.0, B=1.0, M=4.0, N=41\n        (1.0, 1.0, 4.0, 41),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        result = _calculate_invariant(*case)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\ndef _calculate_invariant(A, B, M, N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Z2 invariant for a single set of parameters.\n\n    Args:\n        A (float): Parameter A of the model.\n        B (float): Parameter B of the model.\n        M (float): Parameter M of the model.\n        N (int): Grid size for Brillouin zone sampling.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The Z2 invariant (0 or 1) if insulating, or -1 if not.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Check if the system is an insulator by finding the minimum direct gap.\n    \n    # Create the k-space grid\n    k = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, N)\n    kx_grid, ky_grid = np.meshgrid(k, k)\n\n    # Calculate the components of the d-vector on the grid\n    d_x = A * np.sin(kx_grid)\n    d_y = A * np.sin(ky_grid)\n    d_z = M - 2 * B * (2 - np.cos(kx_grid) - np.cos(ky_grid))\n\n    # Calculate the direct gap E_+ - E_- = 2 * |d|\n    gap = 2 * np.sqrt(d_x**2 + d_y**2 + d_z**2)\n    \n    # Find the minimum gap on the grid\n    min_gap = np.min(gap)\n\n    # Check against the threshold\n    if min_gap = 1e-9:\n        return -1\n        \n    # Step 2: If insulating, compute the Z2 invariant using the parity criterion.\n    \n    # Time-Reversal Invariant Momenta (TRIM)\n    trims = [(0.0, 0.0), (np.pi, 0.0), (0.0, np.pi), (np.pi, np.pi)]\n    \n    parity_product = 1.0\n\n    for kx_trim, ky_trim in trims:\n        # Calculate d_z at the TRIM point\n        d_z_trim = M - 2 * B * (2 - np.cos(kx_trim) - np.cos(ky_trim))\n        \n        # Determine the parity of the occupied band.\n        # Parity is -1 if d_z > 0, and +1 if d_z  0.\n        # This is equivalent to -sign(d_z).\n        # Since the system is gapped, d_z will not be zero at the TRIMs.\n        parity = -np.sign(d_z_trim)\n        parity_product *= parity\n\n    # Determine the Z2 invariant nu from (-1)^nu = parity_product\n    if np.isclose(parity_product, 1.0):\n        nu = 0  # Trivial insulator\n    else:\n        nu = 1  # Topological insulator\n        \n    return nu\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2454026"}, {"introduction": "The defining characteristic of a topological insulator is the bulk-boundary correspondence, which guarantees the existence of protected states at the interface between topologically distinct materials.
