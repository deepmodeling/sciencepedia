Its elementary excitations are abelian anyons: the electric charge $e$, the magnetic flux $m$, and their composite, the dyon $\\psi=em$. The ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code depends on the topology of the manifold on which it is defined. For the purposes of this problem, you may take the following as given: on a Mobius strip, the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code has a GSD of 2. The two-dimensional ground state space $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{GS}}$ can be spanned by two orthonormal states, $\\{|\\psi_1\\rangle, |\\psi_e\\rangle\\}$. These basis states can be understood as arising from the two sectors of the parent theory on a cylinder that are invariant under the glide reflection that turns the cylinder into a Mobius strip, corresponding to the identity (1) and electric ($e$) anyon flux propagating along the cylinder.\n\nNow, consider this system in the presence of a global on-site $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, represented by a unitary operator $U$. This symmetry enriches the topological order, leading to a symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phase. The defining characteristic of this SET phase is how the symmetry acts on the anyons. We specify that the symmetry fractionalizes non-trivially on the electric anyon $e$. This means that a state with an isolated $e$ anyon is not invariant under the symmetry operation, but instead transforms projectively, acquiring a phase of $-1$. The magnetic anyon $m$, in contrast, transforms trivially (with a phase of $+1$). The identity anyon $1$ is always invariant. The transformation property of the dyon $\\psi$ is determined by the fusion rules.

The state $|\\psi_a\\rangle$ represents a ground state with a non-trivial flux of type $a$ through the non-contractible loop of the Mobius strip.

Its Hamiltonian is $H = -J \\sum_s A_s - K \\sum_p B_p$, where the star operators $A_s = \\prod_{i \\in s} \\sigma_i^z$ act on the four qubits on edges meeting at a vertex $s$, and plaquette operators $B_p = \\prod_{i \\in p} \\sigma_i^x$ act on the four qubits on edges forming a plaquette $p$. All $A_s$ and $B_p$ operators commute with each other. The ground states are simultaneous eigenstates of all $A_s$ and $B_p$ with eigenvalue $+1$.\n\nOn a torus with non-trivial cycles $C_1$ and $C_2$, the ground state degeneracy (GSD) is 4. This 4-dimensional space can be described as two logical qubits. The logical Pauli operators are given by Wilson loops of $\\sigma^z$ and $\\sigma^x$ operators along the cycles. We denote them by $Z_1, Z_2$ and $X_1, X_2$, which satisfy the algebra $\\{X_a, Z_b\\} = 0$ if $a=b$ and $[X_a, Z_b] = 0$ if $a \\neq b$. The elementary excitations, or anyons, are the 'e' particle (a vertex $s$ where $A_s=-1$) and the 'm' particle (a plaquette $p$ where $B_p=-1$).\n\nNow, consider this system to be endowed with a global on-site $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, generated by a unitary operator $U_g$. This symmetry enriches the topological order. We consider a specific symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phase where:\n1.  The 'e' particle is neutral under the symmetry, meaning it carries a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge of $+1$.\n2.  The 'm' particle is charged under the symmetry, meaning it carries a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge of $-1$.\n3.  The symmetry operator $U_g$ acts trivially on the 4-dimensional ground state subspace, i.e., $U_g |\\psi_{GS}\\rangle = |\\psi_{GS}\\rangle$ for any ground state $|\\psi_{GS}\\rangle$.\n\nA key property of topological systems on a torus is the action of large-scale translations. The operator $T_a$ that translates the system by one lattice constant along the cycle $C_a$ acts on the ground-state subspace as the logical operator that transports an 'm' particle along the dual cycle $C_a^*$. For the standard toric code on a square lattice, this corresponds to the logical operator $X_b$, where $C_b$ is the cycle orthogonal to $C_a$ (i.e., if $a=1$, $b=2$ and vice-versa). Specifically, $T_1$ acts as $X_2$ and $T_2$ acts as $X_1$ on the logical qubits.\n\nThe problem is to determine the ground state degeneracy of this SET phase on a torus where a single non-trivial symmetry flux line for the generator $g$ is threaded through the cycle $C_1$.", "solution": "1.  **Understand the Setup:** A symmetry flux line of the global $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ generator $g$ is threaded through the torus cycle $C_1$. This means that anyon worldlines that wrap the orthogonal cycle $C_2$ will link with this flux.\n\n2.  **Consistency of Logical Operators:** The logical operators of the toric code correspond to Wilson loops of anyons around the non-contractible cycles. For a logical operator corresponding to a Wilson loop of anyon $a$ around cycle $C_2$ to be well-defined, it must braid trivially with the symmetry flux line it encircles.\n\n3.  **Determine the Braiding Phase:** The phase acquired when an anyon $a$ braids with the $g$-flux is its symmetry fractionalization charge, $\\omega(a)$. The problem specifies $\\omega(e)=+1$ and $\\omega(m)=-1$. The charge of the composite fermion $\\psi=em$ is determined by the fusion rule: $\\omega(\\psi) = \\omega(e)\\omega(m) = (1)(-1) = -1$. The vacuum is always neutral, $\\omega(1)=1$.\n\n4.  **Identify Allowed Anyon Loops:** A Wilson loop around $C_2$ is a consistent logical operator only if the braiding phase is trivial, i.e., $\\omega(a)=+1$. The anyons that satisfy this condition are the identity (1) and the electric charge ($e$).\n\n5.  **Calculate the GSD:** The ground state degeneracy (GSD) in this \"twisted sector\" is equal to the number of distinct anyon types that can form consistent Wilson loops.
