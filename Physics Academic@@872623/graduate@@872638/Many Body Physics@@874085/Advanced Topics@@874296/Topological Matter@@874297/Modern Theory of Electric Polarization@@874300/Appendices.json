With the provided $\\mathbf{d}(k)$ and setting $a=1$, the Hamiltonian matrix is:\n$$\nH(k) = d_x(k) \\sigma_x + d_y(k) \\sigma_y = (t_1 + t_2 \\cos k) \\sigma_x + (t_2 \\sin k) \\sigma_y\n$$\n$$\nH(k) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & d_x(k) - i d_y(k) \\\\ d_x(k) + i d_y(k) & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & h^*(k) \\\\ h(k) & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere we have defined the complex function $h(k) = d_x(k) + i d_y(k)$.\n$$\nh(k) = (t_1 + t_2 \\cos k) + i (t_2 \\sin k) = t_1 + t_2 e^{ik}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $H(k)$ are easily found:\n$$\nE_{\\pm}(k) = \\pm \\sqrt{d_x(k)^2 + d_y(k)^2} = \\pm |h(k)| = \\pm \\sqrt{(t_1+t_2\\cos k)^2 + (t_2\\sin k)^2} = \\pm \\sqrt{t_1^2 + t_2^2 + 2t_1 t_2 \\cos k}\n$$\nThe system is insulating as long as $t_1 \\ne t_2$, which keeps the gap open for all $k$. The filled band is the lower energy band, the valence band, corresponding to the eigenvalue $E_-(k) = -|h(k)|$.\n\nLet's find the corresponding eigenvector $|u_-(k)\\rangle$. We write $h(k)$ in polar form: $h(k) = |h(k)| e^{i\\phi(k)}$.\nThe eigenvector equation is $H(k)|u_-(k)\\rangle = E_-(k)|u_-(k)\\rangle$.

Winding Number of d(k)**\n\nThe phase $\\phi(k)$ is the argument of the complex number $h(k) = d_x(k) + i d_y(k)$.

This is $2\\pi$ times the winding number of the path around the origin.\n\nThe path is described by $d_x(k) = t_1 + t_2 \\cos k$ and $d_y(k) = t_2 \\sin k$. This is a circle of radius $t_2$ centered at $(t_1, 0)$ in the $(d_x, d_y)$ plane.\n\nThe problem specifies the non-trivial regime, $t_2 > t_1 > 0$.\nIn this case, the center of the circle $(t_1, 0)$ is closer to the origin than its radius $t_2$. Therefore, the circular path traced by $\\mathbf{d}(k)$ encloses the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nLet's trace the path as $k$ goes from $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$:\n*   At $k = -\\pi$: $\\mathbf{d}(-\\pi) = (t_1 - t_2, 0)$. Since $t_2 > t_1$, this point is on the negative $d_x$ axis.\n*   At $k = 0$: $\\mathbf{d}(0) = (t_1 + t_2, 0)$. This point is on the positive $d_x$ axis.\n*   At $k = \\pi$: $\\mathbf{d}(\\pi) = (t_1 - t_2, 0)$. The path is closed.\n\nAs $k$ increases from $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$, the vector $\\mathbf{d}(k)$ starts on the negative real axis, sweeps counter-clockwise through the plane, and returns to its starting point, completing one full rotation around the origin. The winding number is therefore 1.\n\nThe total change in phase is the winding number multiplied by $2\\pi$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi = \\phi(\\pi) - \\phi(-\\pi) = 1 \\times 2\\pi = 2\\pi\n$$\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nSubstituting this result into our expression for the Zak phase:\n$$\n\\gamma_Z = \\frac{1}{2} [\\phi(\\pi) - \\phi(-\\pi)] = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\pi) = \\pi\n$$\nThus, the Zak phase for the non-trivial topological phase is $\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pi}\n$$", "id": "1171155"}, {"introduction": "A key physical consequence of the modern theory of polarization is the formation of charge at interfaces between different insulating materials.
