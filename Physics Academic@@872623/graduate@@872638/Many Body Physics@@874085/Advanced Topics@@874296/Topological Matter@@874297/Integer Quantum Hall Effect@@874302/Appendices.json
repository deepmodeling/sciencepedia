First, we verify that this gauge correctly produces the magnetic field: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{L}} = (\\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial z})\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (\\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial x})\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + (\\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial y})\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = (0-0)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (0-0)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + (0 - (-B))\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, which is correct.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\frac{1}{2m} \\left[ \\left(\\hat{p}_x + qA_x\\right)^2 + \\left(\\hat{p}_y + qA_y\\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2m} \\left[ (\\hat{p}_x - qBy)^2 + \\hat{p}_y^2 \\right]\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian operator does not depend on the coordinate $x$. Therefore, the operator $\\hat{p}_x = -i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ commutes with the Hamiltonian: $[\\hat{H}, \\hat{p}_x] = 0$. This implies that $\\hat{H}$ and $\\hat{p}_x$ share a common basis of eigenfunctions. We can thus write the eigenfunctions in a separated form, as a product of an eigenfunction of $\\hat{p}_x$ and a function of $y$:\n$$\n\\psi(x, y) = e^{i k_x x} \\phi(y)\n$$\nHere, $\\hbar k_x$ is the eigenvalue of the momentum operator $\\hat{p}_x$, and $k_x$ is a continuous quantum number.\n\nSubstituting this ansatz into the Schrödinger equation $\\hat{H}\\psi = E\\psi$, the action of $\\hat{p}_x$ on $\\psi$ is simply multiplication by its eigenvalue $\\hbar k_x$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2m} \\left[ (\\hbar k_x - qBy)^2 + \\hat{p}_y^2 \\right] e^{ik_x x} \\phi(y) = E e^{ik_x x} \\phi(y)\n$$\nThe exponential factor $e^{ik_x x}$ cancels from both sides, leaving a one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for the function $\\phi(y)$:\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{\\hat{p}_y^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2m}(\\hbar k_x - qBy)^2 \\right] \\phi(y) = E \\phi(y)\n$$\nThis is the one-dimensional bound-state equation requested.

The energy eigenvalues are independent of the center of the potential $y_0$, and therefore independent of $k_x$. The spectrum is given by the well-known formula for the quantum harmonic oscillator:\n$$\nE_n = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\hbar\\omega_c = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{\\hbar|q|B}{m}\n$$\nwhere $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is a non-negative integer. These are the Landau levels. The energy levels exhibit a high degree of degeneracy due to their independence from the continuous parameter $k_x$.\n\nb) Solution in the Symmetric Gauge\n\nIn the symmetric gauge, the vector potential is $\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{B}{2}(-y, x, 0)$.

Let us define the kinetic momentum operators $\\hat{\\Pi}_x = \\hat{p}_x + qA_x$ and $\\hat{\\Pi}_y = \\hat{p}_y + qA_y$. The Hamiltonian is then simply $\\hat{H} = \\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\Pi}_x^2 + \\hat{\\Pi}_y^2)$. For the symmetric gauge, these operators are:\n$$\n\\hat{\\Pi}_x = \\hat{p}_x - \\frac{qBy}{2}, \\quad \\hat{\\Pi}_y = \\hat{p}_y + \\frac{qBx}{2}\n$$\nLet us compute the commutator of these two operators, using the canonical commutation relations $[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}_x] = i\\hbar$, $[\\hat{y}, \\hat{p}_y] = i\\hbar$, and all other commutators between $\\{x,y,p_x,p_y\\}$ being zero.\n$$\n[\\hat{\\Pi}_x, \\hat{\\Pi}_y] = \\left[\\hat{p}_x - \\frac{qBy}{2}, \\hat{p}_y + \\frac{qBx}{2}\\right] = [\\hat{p}_x, \\hat{p}_y] + \\frac{qB}{2}[\\hat{p}_x, x] - \\frac{qB}{2}[y, \\hat{p}_y] - \\frac{q^2B^2}{4}[y, x]\n$$\nThe first and last terms are zero. We use $[\\hat{p}_x, x] = -i\\hbar$ and $[y, \\hat{p}_y] = i\\hbar$.\n$$\n[\\hat{\\Pi}_x, \\hat{\\Pi}_y] = \\frac{qB}{2}(-i\\hbar) - \\frac{qB}{2}(i\\hbar) = -iqB\\hbar\n$$\nSince this commutator is a non-zero $c$-number, $\\hat{\\Pi}_x$ and $\\hat{\\Pi}_y$ form a Heisenberg algebra, analogous to position and momentum. We can construct bosonic ladder operators. Let's define:\n$$\n\\hat{b} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\hbar|q|B}} (\\hat{\\Pi}_x - i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)\\hat{\\Pi}_y) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\hat{b}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\hbar|q|B}} (\\hat{\\Pi}_x + i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)\\hat{\\Pi}_y)\n$$\nThe commutator of these operators is:\n$$\n[\\hat{b}, \\hat{b}^\\dagger] = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} [ \\hat{\\Pi}_x - i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)\\hat{\\Pi}_y, \\hat{\\Pi}_x + i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)\\hat{\\Pi}_y ] = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} ( i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)[\\hat{\\Pi}_x, \\hat{\\Pi}_y] - i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)[\\hat{\\Pi}_y, \\hat{\\Pi}_x] )\n$$\n$$\n[\\hat{b}, \\hat{b}^\\dagger] = \\frac{2i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)}{2\\hbar|q|B}[\\hat{\\Pi}_x, \\hat{\\Pi}_y] = \\frac{i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)}{\\hbar|q|B}(-iqB\\hbar) = \\frac{\\text{sgn}(q)qB}{|q|B}\n$$\nSince $\\text{sgn}(q)q = |q|$, the commutator is $[\\hat{b}, \\hat{b}^\\dagger] = 1$. This is the standard bosonic commutation relation.\n\nNow, we express the Hamiltonian in terms of these operators. We construct the number operator $\\hat{N} = \\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b}$:\n$$\n\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} (\\hat{\\Pi}_x + i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)\\hat{\\Pi}_y) (\\hat{\\Pi}_x - i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)\\hat{\\Pi}_y) = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} \\left( \\hat{\\Pi}_x^2 + \\hat{\\Pi}_y^2 - i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)[\\hat{\\Pi}_x, \\hat{\\Pi}_y] \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the value of the commutator:\n$$\n\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} \\left( \\hat{\\Pi}_x^2 + \\hat{\\Pi}_y^2 - i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)(-iqB\\hbar) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} \\left( \\hat{\\Pi}_x^2 + \\hat{\\Pi}_y^2 - \\text{sgn}(q)qB\\hbar \\right)\n$$\nAgain using $\\text{sgn}(q)q = |q|$:\n$$\n\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} \\left( \\hat{\\Pi}_x^2 + \\hat{\\Pi}_y^2 - |q|B\\hbar \\right)\n$$\nWe can now express the kinetic energy term $\\hat{\\Pi}_x^2+\\hat{\\Pi}_y^2$ in terms of $\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\Pi}_x^2+\\hat{\\Pi}_y^2 = 2\\hbar|q|B\\,\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} + \\hbar|q|B = \\hbar|q|B(2\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} + 1)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian expression $\\hat{H} = \\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\Pi}_x^2 + \\hat{\\Pi}_y^2)$:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\frac{1}{2m} \\hbar|q|B(2\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} + 1) = \\frac{\\hbar|q|B}{m}\\left(\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis Hamiltonian is equivalent to that of a quantum harmonic oscillator with frequency $\\omega_c = \\frac{|q|B}{m}$. The eigenvalues of the number operator $\\hat{N} = \\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b}$ are the non-negative integers $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. Therefore, the energy eigenvalues are:\n$$\nE_n = \\frac{\\hbar|q|B}{m}\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\hbar\\omega_c\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nc) Comparison and Final Result\n\nThe energy eigenvalues obtained in part (a) using the Landau gauge are $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\frac{\\hbar|q|B}{m}$.\nThe energy eigenvalues obtained in part (b) using the symmetric gauge are $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\frac{\\hbar|q|B}{m}$.\n\nThe two results are identical. This outcome is required by the principle of gauge invariance in quantum mechanics, which states that physical observables, such as energy eigenvalues, cannot depend on the choice of gauge for the electromagnetic potentials. The different gauges lead to different forms for the wavefunctions and different conserved quantities (linear momentum in Landau gauge, angular momentum in symmetric gauge), but the energy spectrum, which is a physical observable, remains the same.\n\nThe common, gauge-independent spectrum of energy levels for a charged particle in a two-dimensional plane under a perpendicular magnetic field is known as the Landau level spectrum.

The single-particle Hamiltonian is given by minimal coupling:\n$$\nH = \\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{p}} + e \\boldsymbol{A})^{2}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{p}}$ is the canonical momentum operator and $\\boldsymbol{A}$ is the magnetic vector potential. We choose the Landau gauge, $\\boldsymbol{A} = (0, Bx, 0)$, which preserves translational invariance in the $y$-direction. The Hamiltonian becomes:\n$$\nH = \\frac{1}{2m}\\left(\\hat{p}_x^2 + (\\hat{p}_y + eBx)^2\\right)\n$$\nSince the operator $\\hat{p}_y$ commutes with $H$, its eigenvalues $\\hbar k_y$ are good quantum numbers.

Each Landau level is highly degenerate.\n\nWe use the Kubo formula for the real part of the AC conductivity at frequency $\\omega$.

Consequently, $f(E_n) = 1$ for $n \\le N-1$ and $f(E_n) = 0$ for $n \\ge N$. The term $(f(E_i) - f(E_f))$ is non-zero only if the initial state $i$ is occupied and the final state $f$ is empty. This requires $n_i \\le N-1$ and $n_f \\ge N$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the matrix elements of the velocity operator, $\\langle n_f, k_{y,f} | \\hat{v}_x | n_i, k_{y,i} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{m} \\langle n_f, k_{y,f} | \\hat{p}_x | n_i, k_{y,i} \\rangle$.

This peak corresponds to resonant absorption of energy to excite electrons from the highest filled Landau level ($N-1$) to the lowest empty one ($N$).\n\nThe problem asks for the direct current (DC) limit, which is $\\omega \\to 0$. As the magnetic field $B$ is non-zero, the cyclotron frequency $\\omega_c$ is strictly positive. In the limit $\\omega \\to 0$, the argument of the delta function, $\\omega_c - \\omega$, approaches $\\omega_c \\neq 0$. The delta function $\\delta(x)$ is zero for any non-zero argument $x$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\text{Re}[\\sigma_{xx}(\\omega \\to 0)] = 0\n$$\nThe longitudinal conductivity vanishes in the DC limit.\n\nThis result is a direct consequence of the key physical assumptions made:\n$1$. The system is perfectly clean (no disorder). This leads to infinitely sharp Landau levels with no states in the energy gaps.\n$2$. The temperature is zero ($T=0$). This ensures a perfectly sharp Fermi cutoff, so that lower Landau levels are completely full and higher ones are completely empty.\n$3$. The chemical potential lies in the gap between Landau levels. This means there is a finite energy gap, $\\hbar\\omega_c$, at the Fermi level.\nBecause of this energy gap, a DC electric field (which corresponds to the $\\omega \\to 0$ limit) cannot induce transitions, as there are no available empty states at infinitesimally close energies. An electron cannot be accelerated because all accessible states are already occupied (Pauli exclusion principle). Consequently, there is no dissipation, and the longitudinal conductivity is zero.\n\nThe final value for the DC longitudinal conductivity is $0$.

Assume the longitudinal resistivity is negligible on these plateaus so that the measured $R_{xy}(B)$ equals the Hall resistivity, and that the current distribution is uniform across the Hall bar.\n\nStarting from the fundamental quantization of Landau level degeneracy per unit area and the definition of the filling factor as the number of completely filled Landau levels, do the following:\n\n- Express the integer filling factor $\\nu$ on a plateau in terms of the measured $R_{xy}(B)$ and fundamental constants only.\n- Using the meaning of $\\nu$ as the number of filled Landau levels and the Landau degeneracy per unit area, derive an analytic expression for the sheet carrier density $n(B)$ on a plateau as a function of $B$ and the measured $R_{xy}(B)$.\n\nExpress the final carrier density in $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, using the International System of Units (SI) for all quantities (i.e., $B$ in $\\mathrm{T}$, $e$ in $\\mathrm{C}$, $R_{xy}$ in $\\Omega$). Do not insert numerical values for constants. Provide your final answer as the pair $\\big(\\nu(B),\\,n(B)\\big)$ in closed form. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a canonical scenario in condensed matter physics—the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE)—and requests the derivation of fundamental relationships from first principles. It is free of contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the defining characteristic of the IQHE plateaus. The Hall resistance, $R_{xy}$, is quantized and given by the expression:\n$$\nR_{xy}(B) = \\frac{R_K}{\\nu}\n$$\nwhere $R_K$ is the von Klitzing constant and $\\nu$ is an integer known as the filling factor. The problem provides the definition of the von Klitzing constant as $R_K \\equiv h/e^2$, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nSubstituting the definition of $R_K$ into the expression for the quantized Hall resistance yields:\n$$\nR_{xy}(B) = \\frac{h}{\\nu e^2}\n$$\nThe first task is to express the filling factor $\\nu$ in terms of the measured Hall resistance $R_{xy}(B)$ and fundamental constants. This is achieved by algebraic rearrangement of the preceding equation:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{h}{e^2 R_{xy}(B)}\n$$\nThis expression provides the value of the integer filling factor for a given plateau characterized by the measured Hall resistance $R_{xy}(B)$.\n\nThe second task is to derive the sheet carrier density, $n(B)$, on a plateau. The problem instructs us to use the physical meaning of the filling factor and the concept of Landau level degeneracy. The filling factor $\\nu$ represents the number of completely filled Landau levels. The total sheet carrier density $n$ is therefore the product of the number of filled levels, $\\nu$, and the degeneracy per unit area of a single Landau level, which we denote as $N_L$.\n$$\nn = \\nu N_L\n$$\nThe degeneracy of a single Landau level per unit area in a perpendicular magnetic field $B$ is a fundamental result from the quantum mechanics of two-dimensional electron systems. It is given by the number of magnetic flux quanta, $\\Phi_0 = h/e$, that can fit into that area, yielding:\n$$\nN_L = \\frac{B}{\\Phi_0} = \\frac{B}{h/e} = \\frac{eB}{h}\n$$\nNote that this expression represents the degeneracy for a single spin-resolved level. The integer $\\nu$ in the IQHE precisely counts the number of such filled, spin-split levels.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $N_L$ into the equation for the sheet density $n$, we have:\n$$\nn(B) = \\nu \\left( \\frac{eB}{h} \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we are asked to express $n(B)$ as a function of the magnetic field $B$ and the measured Hall resistance $R_{xy}(B)$. To do this, we substitute our previously derived expression for $\\nu$:\n$$\nn(B) = \\left( \\frac{h}{e^2 R_{xy}(B)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{eB}{h} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression by canceling common terms, the Planck constant $h$ in the numerator and denominator cancels, as does one factor of the elementary charge $e$. This leads to the final expression for the sheet carrier density:\n$$\nn(B) = \\frac{B}{e R_{xy}(B)}\n$$\nThis result is remarkably simple and demonstrates that on an IQHE plateau, the sheet carrier density is determined solely by the magnetic field and the measured Hall resistance.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be the pair $(\\nu(B), n(B))$. Combining our two derived expressions, we have the complete solution.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{h}{e^{2} R_{xy}(B)}  \\frac{B}{e R_{xy}(B)}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2830181"}]}
