## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the fundamental principles and electronic structures of Weyl and [nodal-line semimetals](@entry_id:144447), focusing on their defining topological features: the point-like Weyl nodes and line-like nodal rings, the associated Berry curvature, and the topologically protected surface states. Having built this theoretical foundation, we now transition from principles to practice. This chapter explores the profound and often exotic physical consequences of this underlying topology. We will demonstrate that these materials are not mere theoretical curiosities but are platforms for a rich variety of observable phenomena with deep connections to other branches of physics, from high-energy particle theory to materials engineering. The application-oriented problems presented in this chapter serve as case studies, illustrating how the core concepts are manifested in measurable quantities and how they can be manipulated by external probes.

### Signatures in Electronic Transport

Perhaps the most direct and celebrated consequences of the topological [band structure](@entry_id:139379) in Weyl and [nodal-line semimetals](@entry_id:144447) are found in their electronic [transport properties](@entry_id:203130). These signatures are not subtle corrections but are often dramatic, qualitatively distinct effects that serve as "smoking gun" evidence for the existence of Weyl fermions in a solid.

A foundational transport signature in time-reversal-breaking Weyl semimetals is the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE). As previously discussed, Weyl nodes act as monopoles of Berry curvature in momentum space. The AHE in these materials has a purely intrinsic, topological origin stemming from the integration of this Berry curvature over the occupied electronic states. In a simplified picture, the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ is directly proportional to the separation of the Weyl nodes in momentum space. For a simple model with a pair of nodes separated by a distance $2k_0$ along the $k_z$ axis, the conductivity can be visualized as the sum of 2D integer quantum Hall conductivities from slices of the Brillouin zone stacked along $k_z$. The slices between the nodes possess a non-zero Chern number, and integrating their contribution yields a total anomalous Hall conductivity proportional to this separation, $\sigma_{xy} = e^2 k_0 / (2\pi^2 \hbar)$ [@problem_id:1135129]. This provides a direct transport measurement of a key topological parameter of the material.

Even more striking are the [transport phenomena](@entry_id:147655) associated with the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077), a concept borrowed from high-energy physics. When parallel electric ($\mathbf{E}$) and magnetic ($\mathbf{B}$) fields are applied to a Weyl semimetal, charge is "pumped" between nodes of opposite chirality at a rate proportional to $\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$. This pumping creates a non-equilibrium population imbalance, or a chiral chemical potential difference, between the valleys. This imbalance, in turn, drives a current via the [chiral magnetic effect](@entry_id:143193) (CME). It is crucial to recognize that the CME does not produce a current in global thermal equilibrium, as the chemical potentials of all nodes are equal, leading to a zero net current [@problem_id:1135123]. However, in a [non-equilibrium steady state](@entry_id:137728) where the anomalous pumping is balanced by [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) processes, a net current is sustained. This mechanism gives rise to a large, positive longitudinal magnetoconductivity, where the conductivity increases quadratically with the magnetic field, $\sigma_{zz} \propto B^2$, a signature often referred to as [negative longitudinal magnetoresistance](@entry_id:146729). This effect is a hallmark of the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) in condensed matter [@problem_id:1135074]. This same anomalous [conductivity tensor](@entry_id:155827) also gives rise to more subtle effects, such as the planar Hall effect, where a transverse voltage develops even when the electric and magnetic fields are coplanar [@problem_id:1135115].

When a magnetic field is applied, the electronic spectrum quantizes into Landau levels. In Weyl semimetals, this quantization is highly unusual. Alongside conventional gapped Landau levels, a unique, one-dimensional, chiral Landau level with linear dispersion $E_0(q_z) = \chi \hbar v_F q_z$ emerges, known as the zeroth Landau level (ZLL). This ZLL is a manifestation of the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) and is responsible for many of the unique magnetotransport properties. A key property of this 1D mode is that its contribution to the density of states per unit volume is constant with respect to energy, a direct consequence of its linear dispersion and high degeneracy, which scales with the magnetic field strength [@problem_id:1135132].

The existence of these unique [electronic states](@entry_id:171776)—both in the bulk and on the surface—gives rise to novel quantum oscillation phenomena. In thin slabs of a Weyl semimetal, electrons can tunnel between the Fermi arc on the top surface and the one on the bottom. In the presence of a magnetic field, this tunneling allows for the formation of "Weyl orbits," which are closed trajectories in a hybrid real-and-momentum space. The quantization of these orbits leads to [quantum oscillations](@entry_id:142355) in [magnetoresistance](@entry_id:265774) and magnetization, whose frequencies are determined by the k-space area enclosed by the orbit. This area depends on the shape of the Fermi arcs and the tunneling momentum imparted by the magnetic field, providing a direct probe of the Fermi arcs and their connectivity through the bulk [@problem_id:1135057]. Similarly, the drumhead [surface states](@entry_id:137922) of a [nodal-line semimetal](@entry_id:193545) also exhibit Landau quantization, but with a crucial difference: because the states exist only within a finite region of the surface Brillouin zone, the Landau level spectrum is truncated. As the magnetic field increases, higher-index Landau levels are pushed beyond the momentum boundary of the [drumhead states](@entry_id:145881) and cease to exist, a phenomenon that can be observed in magnetospectroscopy [@problem_id:1135119].

### Thermodynamic and Optical Responses

Beyond transport, the unique [density of states](@entry_id:147894) (DOS) in [topological semimetals](@entry_id:137800) gives rise to distinctive thermodynamic and optical properties. At low temperatures, the [electronic specific heat](@entry_id:144099) ($C_V$) is a direct probe of the DOS near the Fermi energy. For a [nodal-line semimetal](@entry_id:193545) with a circular nodal ring, the DOS is linear in energy, $g(E) \propto |E|$. This leads to a quadratic temperature dependence of the specific heat, $C_V \propto T^2$, which distinguishes it from the $T^3$ dependence of a Weyl or Dirac semimetal and the linear $T$ dependence of a conventional metal [@problem_id:1135126]. The surface states can have even more exotic signatures. The "drumhead" [surface states](@entry_id:137922) of a [nodal-line semimetal](@entry_id:193545) can, depending on their precise dispersion, exhibit a singular DOS. For a dispersion that is quadratic in momentum away from the nodal ring projection, the DOS diverges as $g(E) \propto |E|^{-1/2}$, resulting in a [specific heat](@entry_id:136923) that scales as $C_V \propto T^{1/2}$ at low temperatures. This demonstrates how surface and bulk contributions can be distinguished thermodynamically [@problem_id:1135138].

The optical properties of these materials are equally rich. In particular, non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals can exhibit large nonlinear optical responses. A key example is the generation of a DC [photocurrent](@entry_id:272634) from an applied static electric field, a second-order effect forbidden in materials with [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948). A major contribution to this effect arises from the "Berry curvature dipole" (BCD), which is the first moment of the Berry curvature in momentum space. The BCD is non-zero only in certain inversion-breaking crystal classes and acts as a measure of the geometric properties of the electronic wavefunctions. By measuring the nonlinear [conductivity tensor](@entry_id:155827), one can directly probe the components of the BCD, which are constrained by the crystal's [point group symmetry](@entry_id:141230) [@problem_id:1135068].

### Interdisciplinary Frontiers and Materials Engineering

The physics of Weyl and [nodal-line semimetals](@entry_id:144447) extends far beyond traditional [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660), connecting to high-energy physics, astrophysics, and advanced materials engineering.

The [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) and the associated transport signatures are direct solid-state realizations of the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in quantum field theory. Another profound link is found in the anomalous thermal Hall effect. At the [charge neutrality](@entry_id:138647) point, the thermal Hall conductivity of a Weyl semimetal is predicted to be proportional to temperature, with a universal coefficient determined by the sum of the Weyl node positions weighted by their chiralities. This phenomenon is deeply connected to the gravitational anomaly, where the temperature gradient in the material plays the role of a fictitious gravito-magnetic field acting on the quasiparticles [@problem_id:1135113]. The [electrodynamics](@entry_id:158759) of Weyl semimetals can also be described by an "[axion](@entry_id:156508)" term, where the momentum-space separation of the Weyl nodes plays the role of a background axion field gradient. This leads to exotic phenomena such as the prediction that a spatial gradient in the material's [topological properties](@entry_id:154666) can induce an electric [charge density](@entry_id:144672) in the presence of a magnetic field [@problem_id:1135084].

This rich physics opens avenues for engineering and controlling topological phases.
For instance, the topological properties of these materials are not immutable but can be tuned by external fields. Mechanical strain, for example, can act as a powerful control knob. Applying strain can modify the Hamiltonian, causing the Weyl nodes to move in momentum space. This "[strain engineering](@entry_id:139243)" provides a way to controllably tune [transport properties](@entry_id:203130) like the anomalous Hall effect [@problem_id:1135121]. Sufficiently strong or appropriately designed strain can even drive [topological phase](@entry_id:146448) transitions, for instance, by closing and reopening the band gap to transform a trivial insulator into a [nodal-line semimetal](@entry_id:193545) [@problem_id:1135127].

Another frontier is the interface between [topological semimetals](@entry_id:137800) and other quantum phases of matter. When a Fermi arc is brought into proximity with a conventional [s-wave](@entry_id:754474) superconductor, Cooper pairing is induced in the arc. This creates a one-dimensional [topological superconductor](@entry_id:145362), a system predicted to host Majorana zero modes at its ends. Studying the sub-gap energy spectrum of such a hybrid system is a crucial step toward realizing these exotic, non-Abelian excitations [@problem_id:1135064]. Similarly, the interaction of a magnetic impurity with the conduction electrons of a Weyl semimetal leads to a novel variant of the Kondo effect. The quadratic [density of states](@entry_id:147894), $\rho(E_F) \propto E_F^2$, near a Weyl node results in a Kondo temperature that depends exponentially on $1/E_F^2$, a stark contrast to the behavior in conventional metals. This opens a new regime for studying [quantum impurity](@entry_id:143828) physics [@problem_id:1135120].

Finally, the field of Floquet engineering uses [periodic driving](@entry_id:146581), typically with intense laser light, to dynamically create effective Hamiltonians with properties not found in any static material. For example, illuminating a simple 2D Dirac material like graphene with circularly polarized light can dynamically generate an effective mass term. This technique can be used to engineer "Floquet-Weyl" semimetals, where Weyl points are created in a synthetic dimension of energy and momentum, offering a route to dynamically switchable topological phenomena [@problem_id:1135071].

The very existence and form of the topological [surface states](@entry_id:137922) are themselves a subject of intense investigation. The shape, length, and even visibility of Fermi arcs depend crucially on the choice of surface termination. The distance between the projected Weyl nodes on the surface Brillouin zone is a function of the angle between the surface normal and the vector separating the nodes in the bulk. When the surface normal is parallel to this separation vector, the nodes project to the same point, and the [topological protection](@entry_id:145388) for an open Fermi arc is lost [@problem_id:3024270]. Even when they appear, these states are, by definition, localized to the surface. Their wavefunctions decay exponentially into the bulk, and the associated decay length, which depends on the material's band parameters, quantifies their degree of surface confinement [@problem_id:1135089]. In [thin films](@entry_id:145310), the wavefunctions of Fermi arcs on opposite surfaces can overlap and hybridize, opening an energy gap and leading to quantum confinement effects such as conductance oscillations that depend sensitively on the film thickness [@problem_id:1135086]. Furthermore, intrinsic material properties like spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can have a dramatic effect. In a [nodal-line semimetal](@entry_id:193545), for example, SOC can lift the band degeneracy along the nodal line, opening a gap and turning the material into a 3D topological insulator or a trivial insulator, illustrating the delicate interplay of symmetry and topology that governs these [phases of matter](@entry_id:196677) [@problem_id:1135110].
