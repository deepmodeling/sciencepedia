The Fu-Kane criterion for inversion-symmetric insulators provides a direct method for this calculation.\n\nThe $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant, denoted by $\\nu \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, characterizes the topological phase of the insulator. For a time-reversal invariant system that also possesses inversion symmetry, the invariant $\\nu$ can be determined from the parity eigenvalues of the occupied energy bands at the time-reversal invariant momenta (TRIM). For a two-dimensional system on a square lattice, there are four TRIMs in the Brillouin zone: $\\Lambda_1 = (0,0)$, $\\Lambda_2 = (\\pi,0)$, $\\Lambda_3 = (0,\\pi)$, and $\\Lambda_4 = (\\pi,\\pi)$.\n\nThe Fu-Kane formula is given by:\n$$\n(-1)^{\\nu} = \\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\delta_i\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_i$ is the product of the parity eigenvalues of the occupied Kramers pair at the TRIM $\\Lambda_i$. At a TRIM, the two states forming a Kramers pair have the same parity eigenvalue $\\xi_i$. Therefore, $\\delta_i = \\xi_i \\cdot \\xi_i = \\xi_i^2 = 1$. However, this is a common point of confusion. The correct application of the formula involves the product of parity eigenvalues of a set of states that smoothly connect to the occupied states, one from each Kramers pair. Since the parities of the two states in a Kramers pair are identical at TRIMs, we can simply compute the product of the parities of half of the occupied bands. In this model, there are two occupied bands (a single Kramers pair at each $\\mathbf{k}$), so we need to determine the parity $\\xi_i$ of one of these occupied states at each TRIM $\\Lambda_i$. The formula then becomes:\n$$\n(-1)^{\\nu} = \\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\xi_i\n$$\n\nTo find the parity $\\xi_i$, we must first evaluate the Hamiltonian at the TRIMs. The given Hamiltonian is:\n$$\nH(\\mathbf{k}) = A \\sin k_x \\, \\tau_x \\otimes s_z \\;+\\; A \\sin k_y \\, \\tau_y \\otimes s_0 \\;+\\; M(\\mathbf{k}) \\, \\tau_z \\otimes s_0\n$$\nAt any TRIM $\\Lambda_i=(k_x, k_y)$ where $k_x, k_y \\in \\{0, \\pi\\}$, the terms $\\sin k_x$ and $\\sin k_y$ are equal to $0$. The Hamiltonian simplifies significantly:\n$$\nH(\\Lambda_i) = M(\\Lambda_i) \\, \\tau_z \\otimes s_0\n$$\nThe inversion operator is given as $P = \\tau_z \\otimes s_0$. Thus, at the TRIMs, the Hamiltonian is directly proportional to the inversion operator: $H(\\Lambda_i) = M(\\Lambda_i) P$.\n\nThe operator $P$ commutes with $H(\\Lambda_i)$, so they share a common eigenbasis. The eigenvalues of $P$ are $\\pm 1$, corresponding to the spatial parity of the orbitals. The basis is composed of an even-parity $s$-like orbital (parity eigenvalue $+1$) and an odd-parity $p$-like orbital (parity eigenvalue $-1$). In this basis, $\\tau_z$ is represented by the diagonal matrix $\\text{diag}(1, -1)$.\nThe eigenvalues of $H(\\Lambda_i)$ are the energy levels at the TRIMs. Since $P$ has eigenvalues $\\pm 1$, the eigenvalues of $H(\\Lambda_i)$ are $\\pm M(\\Lambda_i)$.\nThe eigenstates corresponding to energy $E = +M(\\Lambda_i)$ are the $s$-like states, which have parity $+1$.\nThe eigenstates corresponding to energy $E = -M(\\Lambda_i)$ are the $p$-like states, which have parity $-1$.\n\nThe problem specifies the system is at half-filling, which means the two lowest-energy bands are filled. At each TRIM $\\Lambda_i$, we must identify the occupied energy level.\n- If $M(\\Lambda_i) > 0$, the two energy levels are $+M(\\Lambda_i)$ and $-M(\\Lambda_i)$. The occupied (lower) level is $-M(\\Lambda_i)$. The corresponding eigenstates are the $p$-like states. Therefore, the parity of the occupied Kramers pair is $\\xi_i = -1$.\n- If $M(\\Lambda_i) < 0$, the two energy levels are $+M(\\Lambda_i)$ and $-M(\\Lambda_i)$. The occupied (lower) level is $+M(\\Lambda_i)$. The corresponding eigenstates are the $s$-like states. Therefore, the parity of the occupied Kramers pair is $\\xi_i = +1$.\n\nIn general, the parity of the occupied bands at a TRIM $\\Lambda_i$ is given by $\\xi_i = -\\text{sgn}(M(\\Lambda_i))$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $M(\\mathbf{k})$ at each of the four TRIMs using the given parameters $M=3$ and $B=1$. The mass function is:\n$$\nM(\\mathbf{k}) = M - 2 B \\bigl(2 - \\cos k_x - \\cos k_y \\bigr) = 3 - 2(1) \\bigl(2 - \\cos k_x - \\cos k_y \\bigr) = -1 + 2\\cos k_x + 2\\cos k_y\n$$\n\n1.  **TRIM $\\Lambda_1 = (0,0)$**:\n    $M(\\Lambda_1) = -1 + 2\\cos(0) + 2\\cos(0) = -1 + 2 + 2 = 3$.\n    Since $M(\\Lambda_1) = 3 > 0$, the parity is $\\xi_1 = -1$.\n\n2.  **TRIM $\\Lambda_2 = (\\pi,0)$**:\n    $M(\\Lambda_2) = -1 + 2\\cos(\\pi) + 2\\cos(0) = -1 - 2 + 2 = -1$.\n    Since $M(\\Lambda_2) = -1 < 0$, the parity is $\\xi_2 = +1$.\n\n3.  **TRIM $\\Lambda_3 = (0,\\pi)$**:\n    $M(\\Lambda_3) = -1 + 2\\cos(0) + 2\\cos(\\pi) = -1 + 2 - 2 = -1$.\n    Since $M(\\Lambda_3) = -1 < 0$, the parity is $\\xi_3 = +1$.\n\n4.  **TRIM $\\Lambda_4 = (\\pi,\\pi)$**:\n    $M(\\Lambda_4) = -1 + 2\\cos(\\pi) + 2\\cos(\\pi) = -1 - 2 - 2 = -5$.\n    Since $M(\\Lambda_4) = -5 < 0$, the parity is $\\xi_4 = +1$.\n\nNow, we compute the product of these parities to find the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant:\n$$\n(-1)^{\\nu} = \\xi_1 \\cdot \\xi_2 \\cdot \\xi_3 \\cdot \\xi_4 = (-1) \\cdot (+1) \\cdot (+1) \\cdot (+1) = -1\n$$\nFrom the equation $(-1)^{\\nu} = -1$, we conclude that the topological invariant $\\nu$ must be $1$.

This gapless spectrum is protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS).\n\nThe Zeeman term $H_Z$ couples to the spin. Given the in-plane magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B\\cos\\phi\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + B\\sin\\phi\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, we have $B_x = B \\cos\\phi$ and $B_y = B \\sin\\phi$.
