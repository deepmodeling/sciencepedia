This imbalance guarantees the existence of zero-energy modes, forming a flat band whose degeneracy is directly related to the site difference. This exercise [@problem_id:1138779] provides a hands-on example of this principle, asking you to find the flat band energy in a decorated honeycomb lattice where this sublattice imbalance is manifest.", "problem": "Consider a tight-binding model on a decorated honeycomb lattice. This lattice is constructed from a standard two-dimensional honeycomb lattice by adding an extra site at the midpoint of each of its bonds. Let the original honeycomb sites be denoted as V-sites (for vertex) and the new sites added at the bond centers be denoted as B-sites (for bond).\n\nThe tight-binding Hamiltonian for this system is given by:\n$$ H = -t \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} (c_i^\\dagger c_j + c_j^\\dagger c_i) $$\nwhere $c_i^\\dagger$ and $c_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron at site $i$, and the sum runs over all pairs of nearest-neighbor sites $\\langle i,j \\rangle$. The hopping parameter $t$ is a real constant and is uniform for all bonds. All sites, both V and B types, are assumed to have the same on-site energy, which is set to zero.\n\nDetermine the energy of the dispersionless (flat) band in the electronic band structure of this lattice.", "solution": "1.  The lattice is bipartite. The V-sites form one sublattice and the B-sites form the other. The unit cell contains 2 V-sites and 3 B-sites. This gives a sublattice imbalance of $|2-3|=1$.\n2.  In the Bloch basis, the Hamiltonian for a bipartite lattice takes the form:\n    $$\n    H(\\mathbf{k}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\mathbf{0}_{2\\times2}  C^\\dagger(\\mathbf{k})\\\\\n    C(\\mathbf{k})  \\mathbf{0}_{3\\times3}\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n3.  The eigenvalues $E$ are found by solving the secular equation. For $E \\ne 0$, we can show this is equivalent to solving for the singular values of $C(\\mathbf{k})$. Squaring the Hamiltonian gives a block-diagonal matrix:\n    $$\n    H^2(\\mathbf{k}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    C^\\dagger C  \\mathbf{0}\\\\\n    \\mathbf{0}  C C^\\dagger\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The eigenvalues of $H^2$ are $E^2$.\n4.

Correspondingly, $C^\\dagger C$ (which is $2\\times2$) has no guaranteed zero eigenvalues.\n5.  The existence of at least one zero eigenvalue for $H^2(\\mathbf{k})$ for all $\\mathbf{k}$ means there is at least one band with energy $E=0$ for all $\\mathbf{k}$. This is the flat band.\n6.
