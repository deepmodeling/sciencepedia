This can be understood using a variant of the Imry-Ma argument.\n\nConsider a large, pre-existing domain of spins pointing down. We investigate the energetic favorability of flipping a segment of $L$ consecutive spins to point up. This creates a new domain of length $L$. The creation of this domain incurs an energy cost from forming two domain walls at its ends. It also results in an energy change due to the interaction of the flipped spins with their local random fields.\n\nThe energy cost to create the two domain walls is $4J$.

This corresponds to setting the effective boundary field to $h_0 = -J$. This change may cause spin $S_1$ to become unstable and flip, which in turn may cause $S_2$ to flip, and so on.

When a spin $S_i$ flips from $+1$ to $-1$, the local field on each of its $z$ neighbors changes. A neighbor $j$ experiences a change in its local field by an amount $\\Delta F_{neigh} = -2J$ (since one of its neighbors flipped from $+1$ to $-1$).
