The language is objective and uses precise terminology from the field. No physical or mathematical contradictions are present. The setup is a standard model used to interpret experimental data on materials such as Ce- or Yb-based intermetallic compounds.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated, non-trivial problem in theoretical condensed matter physics. I shall proceed to the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe problem requires a determination of the angular dependence of the Kondo resonance splitting and the magnetoresistance. These two quantities are intimately linked, as both are consequences of the Zeeman splitting of the local magnetic moment.\n\n**1. Kondo Resonance Splitting $\\Delta(\\theta)$**\n\nThe local moment arises from a CEF doublet, which can be described by an effective pseudospin-$1/2$ operator $\\mathbf{S}$. The Zeeman interaction with an external magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is given by the Hamiltonian $H_{Z} = \\mu_{B} \\mathbf{S} \\cdot \\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$, where $\\mu_{B}$ is the Bohr magneton and $\\mathbf{g}$ is the anisotropic $g$-tensor.\n\nIn the principal axis system of the tetragonal crystal, with the $z$-axis along the crystallographic $c$-axis, the $g$-tensor is diagonal:\n$$\n\\mathbf{g} = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{\\perp}  0  0 \\\\ 0  g_{\\perp}  0 \\\\ 0  0  g_{\\parallel} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe magnetic field vector $\\mathbf{B}$ has magnitude $B_{0}$ and is oriented at an angle $\\theta$ relative to the $c$-axis. We can write $\\mathbf{B}$ in the principal axis system as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B} = B_{0} (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)\n$$\nDue to the tetragonal symmetry ($g_x = g_y = g_\\perp$), the physics is independent of the azimuthal angle $\\phi$. We may set $\\phi=0$ without loss of generality, so $\\mathbf{B} = B_{0}(\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\nThe effective magnetic field felt by the pseudospin is $\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = B_{0} (g_{\\perp}\\sin\\theta, 0, g_{\\parallel}\\cos\\theta)\n$$\nThe Zeeman Hamiltonian becomes $H_{Z} = \\mu_{B} \\mathbf{S} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The energy eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are $\\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{B} |\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{eff}}|$. The total energy splitting of the doublet is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{Z} = \\mu_{B} |\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{eff}}| = \\mu_{B} \\sqrt{(B_{0} g_{\\perp}\\sin\\theta)^{2} + (B_{0} g_{\\parallel}\\cos\\theta)^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{Z} = \\mu_{B} B_{0} \\sqrt{g_{\\perp}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta + g_{\\parallel}^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta}\n$$\nIn the Kondo regime, the single Kondo resonance peak at the Fermi energy $E_{F}$ (for $B=0$) splits into two peaks under the application of a magnetic field. This splitting, $\\Delta$, is directly proportional to the Zeeman splitting of the local moment, $\\Delta E_{Z}$. The problem provides the proportionality constant as $c_{\\Delta}$.\n$$\n\\Delta(\\theta) \\approx c_{\\Delta} \\Delta E_{Z} = c_{\\Delta}\\,\\mu_{B}\\,B_{0}\\,\\sqrt{g_{\\perp}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta+g_{\\parallel}^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta}\n$$\n\n**2. Low-Field Magnetoresistance $\\Delta \\rho(\\theta)/\\rho_{0}$**\n\nAt temperatures $T \\ll T_{K}$, the system is a Fermi liquid. The large zero-field resistivity $\\rho_0$ is due to strong resonant scattering of conduction electrons by the Kondo-screened local moments. At $T=0$, the scattering phase shift at the Fermi level is $\\pi/2$, corresponding to the unitary limit.\n\nA magnetic field lifts the degeneracy of the spin-up and spin-down scattering channels. This suppresses the spin-flip scattering processes that are crucial to the Kondo effect. The result is a reduction in the total scattering cross-section, which manifests as a negative magnetoresistance ($\\Delta\\rho = \\rho(B) - \\rho_0  0$).\n\nAccording to Fermi liquid theory for the Kondo problem (Nozières), in the low-field limit ($\\Delta E_Z \\ll k_B T_K$), the correction to the resistivity is quadratic in the field-induced energy scale. The dimensionless perturbation parameter is the ratio of the Zeeman energy to the Kondo energy, $(\\Delta E_{Z} / k_B T_K)$.\nTherefore, the relative change in resistivity is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_{0}} \\propto -\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_{Z}}{k_{B} T_{K}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates a decrease in resistivity. Substituting our expression for $\\Delta E_{Z}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\rho(\\theta)}{\\rho_{0}} \\approx -\\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{B} B_{0} \\sqrt{g_{\\perp}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta + g_{\\parallel}^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta}}{k_{B} T_{K}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a positive constant of order unity that absorbs the details of the Fermi liquid parameters, as stated in the problem. Squaring the term inside the parenthesis gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\rho(\\theta)}{\\rho_{0}} \\approx -\\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{B} B_{0}}{k_{B} T_{K}}\\right)^{2} \\left(g_{\\perp}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta + g_{\\parallel}^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta\\right)\n$$\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $\\Delta(\\theta) \\approx c_{\\Delta}\\,\\mu_{B}\\,B_{0}\\,\\sqrt{g_{\\perp}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta+g_{\\parallel}^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta}$, and $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\Delta \\rho(\\theta)}{\\rho_{0}} \\approx -\\,\\alpha\\,\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{B}\\,B_{0}}{k_{B}\\,T_{K}}\\right)^{2}\\,\\big(g_{\\perp}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta+g_{\\parallel}^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta\\big)$.**\nThe expression for the resonance splitting $\\Delta(\\theta)$ perfectly matches our derivation. The expression for the magnetoresistance $\\Delta \\rho(\\theta)/\\rho_{0}$ also perfectly matches our derivation, correctly capturing the negative sign, the quadratic dependence on the effective Zeeman energy, and the angular dependence arising from the anisotropic $g$-tensor.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\Delta(\\theta) \\approx c_{\\Delta}\\,\\mu_{B}\\,B_{0}\\,g_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ independent of angle (with $g_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ a constant), and $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\Delta \\rho(\\theta)}{\\rho_{0}} \\approx +\\,\\alpha\\,B_{0}^{2}\\,\\sin^{2}\\theta$ due solely to orbital motion.**\nThe expression for $\\Delta(\\theta)$ claims angle-independent splitting, which contradicts the premise of an anisotropic $g$-tensor. This is incorrect. The expression for magnetoresistance claims it is positive and due to orbital motion. This is incorrect; the characteristic magnetoresistance of a Kondo system is negative, and the problem explicitly instructs to neglect orbital effects.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $\\Delta(\\theta) \\approx c_{\\Delta}\\,\\mu_{B}\\,B_{0}\\,\\big(g_{\\perp}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta+g_{\\parallel}^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta\\big)^{-1/2}$, and $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\Delta \\rho(\\theta)}{\\rho_{0}} \\approx -\\,\\alpha\\,\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{B}\\,B_{0}}{k_{B}\\,T_{K}}\\right)^{2}\\,\\big(g_{\\perp}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta+g_{\\parallel}^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta\\big)$.**\nThe expression for $\\Delta(\\theta)$ has the angular dependence inverted (exponent is $-1/2$ instead of $+1/2$). The splitting must be proportional to the effective g-factor, not inversely proportional. This is physically incorrect.

The Zeeman splitting energy is calculated from the magnitude of a vector, which involves a sum of squares under a square root. This functional form is incorrect. The description of magnetoresistance correctly identifies it as negative and quadratic in $B_0$, but incorrectly claims it is independent of angle $\\theta$. The anisotropy of the Zeeman splitting must translate into an anisotropic magnetoresistance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2833099"}]}
