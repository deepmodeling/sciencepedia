A more precise characterization is given by the variance of the dimensionless conductance, $\\mathrm{var}(g)$, where $g = G / (e^2/h)$.\n\nAccording to random matrix theory, the variance of the conductance depends on the fundamental symmetries of the system's Hamiltonian, namely time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and spin-rotation symmetry. This dependence is captured by a symmetry index $\\beta$, leading to the relation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{var}(g) = \\frac{C}{\\beta}\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant determined by the geometry of the conductor (e.g., quasi-1D, 2D, 3D) but is independent of the symmetry class. The three canonical Dyson symmetry ensembles are:\n1.  **Orthogonal Ensemble (OE):** Characterized by $\\beta=1$. This class applies when both TRS and spin-rotation symmetry are present.

This class applies when TRS is preserved, but spin-rotation symmetry is broken, which is typically caused by strong spin-orbit (SO) coupling.\n\nConsider a mesoscopic conductor where scattering is dominated by strong spin-orbit interactions, placing it firmly within the Symplectic Ensemble. Subsequently, a small concentration of magnetic impurities is introduced into the conductor. This addition introduces a new scattering mechanism that breaks time-reversal symmetry.\n\nBased on the information provided, determine whether the amplitude of the universal conductance fluctuations, defined as $\\delta g = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{var}(g)}$, initially increases upon the addition of these magnetic impurities.

The variance of the dimensionless conductance, $\\mathrm{var}(g) = \\langle (g - \\langle g \\rangle)^2 \\rangle$ where $g=G/(e^2/h)$, can be understood as arising from two types of quantum interference processes: Diffuson and Cooperon channels.
