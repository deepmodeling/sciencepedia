The electrical conductance, $G$, of such a device is quantized due to the wave-like nature of electrons. The conductance is given by the Landauer formula:\n$$ G = G_0 \\sum_{n=1}^{N} T_n $$\nwhere $G_0 = 2e^2/h$ is the conductance quantum, $e$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $T_n$ is the transmission probability for the $n$-th available transverse mode (or channel) in the constriction. The values of $T_n$ are between 0 (fully reflected) and 1 (fully transmitted).\n\nWhen a voltage $V$ is applied across a conductor at a finite temperature $T$, there are fluctuations in the electric current, which can be characterized by the low-frequency power spectral density of current noise, $S_I(V,T)$.

It is present even at zero bias voltage, $S_I(V=0,T)$.\n2.  **Shot Noise:** Arises from the discreteness of charge carriers.
