It consists of a central scattering region connected to three electron reservoirs (leads), labeled 1, 2, and 3. The transport properties of such a junction at low temperatures are described by the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. Within this framework, the relationship between incoming and outgoing electron wave amplitudes is given by a unitary scattering matrix $S$. The element $S_{ij}$ represents the complex amplitude for an electron incident from lead $j$ to be scattered into lead $i$. The transmission probability from lead $j$ to lead $i$ is then $T_{ij} = |S_{ij}|^2$.\n\nIn addition to the average DC current, the fluctuations of the current, known as noise, provide crucial information about the nature of charge transport.

These states are characterized by a filling factor $\\nu$, the ratio of electrons to magnetic flux quanta. The low-energy charge carriers in FQH states are not electrons, but emergent quasiparticles with fractional elementary charge $e^*$.\n\nOne way to probe this fractional charge is through shot noise measurements. Consider a T-junction geometry etched into a system hosting an FQH fluid with filling factor $\\nu = 2/5$. A DC voltage bias $V$ is applied to a source terminal (S), driving a current along a chiral edge state. This edge state is then split at the junction into two paths, leading to two separate drain terminals (D1 and D2), which are both held at ground potential.
