The kinetic energy $K_1 = p_1^2 / (2m_\\alpha)$ is maximized when the magnitude of its momentum, $p_1 = |\\vec{p}_{\\alpha 1}|$, is maximized.\n\nFrom the momentum conservation equation, we have:\n$$\n\\vec{p}_{\\alpha 1} = -(\\vec{p}_D + \\vec{p}_{\\alpha 2})\n$$\nThe magnitude $p_1 = |\\vec{p}_{\\alpha 1}| = |\\vec{p}_D + \\vec{p}_{\\alpha 2}|$ is maximized when the vectors $\\vec{p}_D$ and $\\vec{p}_{\\alpha 2}$ are parallel and point in the same direction.

To maximize the recoil momentum $p_1$, the recoiling system $(D+\\alpha_2)$ must be as \"rigid\" as possible, meaning it has minimal internal kinetic energy for a given total momentum $p_1$. The kinetic energy of the $(D+\\alpha_2)$ system is $K_D+K_{\\alpha 2} = \\frac{p_D^2}{2M_D} + \\frac{p_{\\alpha 2}^2}{2m_\\alpha}$ with the constraint $p_D+p_{\\alpha 2}=p_1$. This sum is minimized when the two particles have the same velocity, $v_D = v_{\\alpha 2}$.\nProof: Let $v_D = v_{\\alpha 2} = v$. Then $p_D = M_D v$ and $p_{\\alpha 2} = m_\\alpha v$. The total momentum is $p_1 = p_D + p_{\\alpha 2} = (M_D + m_\\alpha)v$. The total kinetic energy becomes $K_D+K_{\\alpha 2} = \\frac{1}{2}M_D v^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_\\alpha v^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(M_D+m_\\alpha)v^2$. We can write this as $\\frac{p_1^2}{2(M_D+m_\\alpha)}$. Any other partition of $p_1$ into $p_D$ and $p_{\\alpha 2}$ yields a higher kinetic energy, leaving less for $K_1$.\n\nThus, to maximize $K_1$, the daughter nucleus and the second alpha particle must recoil together with the same velocity.
