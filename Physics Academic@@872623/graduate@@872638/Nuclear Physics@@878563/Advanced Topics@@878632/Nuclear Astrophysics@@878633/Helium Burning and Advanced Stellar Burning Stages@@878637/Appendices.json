By solving a reaction-diffusion equation, you will quantify how convective efficiency determines the final abundance distribution of newly forged elements within a helium-burning shell.", "problem": "In the late stages of stellar evolution, stars on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) develop thermally pulsing helium-burning shells. These shells are convective and provide a primary environment for the slow neutron capture process (s-process). Within this convective zone, certain isotopes on the s-process path are unstable to beta decay with half-lives comparable to the neutron-capture timescale. These are known as \"branch point\" isotopes. The final abundance pattern of s-process elements is highly sensitive to the physical conditions (temperature, neutron density) at these branch points.\n\nConsider a simplified one-dimensional model of such a convective helium-burning shell, extending from a central plane at $x=0$ to its edges at $x=\\pm L$. The mixing of material within this shell is modeled as a turbulent diffusion process with a constant diffusion coefficient $D$.\n\nA specific s-process branch point isotope, let's call it 'X', is produced and destroyed within this shell. The production of isotope X occurs via neutron capture on a stable predecessor isotope, and due to the high temperature sensitivity of the primary neutron source reactions (e.g., $^{22}\\text{Ne}(\\alpha,n)^{25}\\text{Mg}$), we model this production as being concentrated entirely at the center of the shell, $x=0$.
