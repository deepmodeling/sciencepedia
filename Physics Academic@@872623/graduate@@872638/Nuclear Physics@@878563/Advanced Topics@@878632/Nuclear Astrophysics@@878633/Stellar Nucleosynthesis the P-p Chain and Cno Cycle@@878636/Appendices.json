It is customary to parameterize the low-energy cross-section $\\sigma(E)$ as:\n$$\n\\sigma(E) = \\frac{S(E)}{E} \\exp(-2\\pi\\eta)\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the center-of-mass energy, $\\eta$ is the Sommerfeld parameter, and $S(E)$ is the astrophysical S-factor, which encapsulates the nuclear physics of the reaction.\n\nThe p-p reaction is a weak Gamow-Teller transition, and its S-factor, denoted $S_{11}$, is directly proportional to the square of the axial-vector coupling constant, $g_A^2$. In the dense and hot plasma of a stellar core, the properties of nucleons are expected to be modified compared to their vacuum values. The Brown-Rho scaling hypothesis suggests that the in-medium axial coupling constant, $g_A^*$, is quenched.
