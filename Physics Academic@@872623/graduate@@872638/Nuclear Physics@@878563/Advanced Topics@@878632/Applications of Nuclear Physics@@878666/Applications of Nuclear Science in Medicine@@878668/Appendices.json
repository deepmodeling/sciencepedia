It de-excites from a metastable state to the ground state via a single transition, releasing energy that can be carried away by either a gamma ray or a conversion electron. The decay is dominated by internal conversion (IC) from the $n$-th electron shell, specifically from the s-orbital ($l=0$).\n\nThe internal conversion coefficient, $\\alpha$, which is the ratio of the IC decay rate to the gamma decay rate, is directly proportional to the probability density of the participating electron at the nucleus, $|\\psi_{ns}(0)|^2$. We can write this as $\\alpha = \\kappa |\\psi_{ns}(0)|^2$, where $\\kappa$ is a constant determined by the nuclear transition properties and is independent of the atom's chemical environment.\n\nThe therapeutic effect of this isomer arises from the localized energy deposition by the ejected conversion electrons. Consequently, the absorbed dose $D$ in the target tissue is directly proportional to the probability of internal conversion per decay, $P_{IC} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}$.\n\nTo estimate how the chemical environment affects the therapeutic dose, the electron density at the nucleus is modeled using the screened hydrogenic model.
