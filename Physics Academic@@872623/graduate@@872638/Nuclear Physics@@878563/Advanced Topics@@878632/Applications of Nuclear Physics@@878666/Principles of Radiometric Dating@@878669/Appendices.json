The parent isotope $^{87}$Rb decays to the daughter isotope $^{87}$Sr with a known decay constant $\\lambda$.\n\nThis particular mineral has an unusual solid-state property. It is stable in its initial crystallographic phase, Phase $\\alpha$, where strontium atoms are immobile. However, the accumulation of radiogenic $^{87}$Sr atoms (denoted $^{87}$Sr*) strains the crystal lattice. When the concentration of radiogenic strontium, normalized to the stable $^{86}$Sr isotope, reaches a critical threshold $C_{crit}$, i.e., when $(^{87}\\text{Sr}*/^{86}\\text{Sr}) = C_{crit}$, the mineral undergoes a first-order phase transition to Phase $\\beta$. In Phase $\\beta$, the diffusivity of strontium increases dramatically, such that any subsequently produced $^{87}$Sr* atoms are immediately lost from the mineral grain.
