For quadrupole deformations, the shape of the nucleus is described by a set of five deformation parameters $\\alpha_{2\\mu}$ ($\\mu = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2$). In the simple harmonic vibrator model, the Hamiltonian is quantized, leading to elementary excitations called phonons.\n\nThe excitations are created and annihilated by phonon operators $b_{2\\mu}^\\dagger$ and $b_{2\\mu}$, respectively, which obey standard bosonic commutation relations:\n$[b_{2\\mu}, b_{2\\nu}] = 0$, $[b_{2\\mu}^\\dagger, b_{2\\nu}^\\dagger] = 0$, and $[b_{2\\mu}, b_{2\\nu}^\\dagger] = \\delta_{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\nThe states of the nucleus are characterized by the number of phonons, $N$.\n- The ground state, $|0_1^+\\rangle$, is the phonon vacuum ($N=0$), with total angular momentum $I=0$.

For a system of identical fermions occupying a single shell with half-integer angular momentum $j$, a quadrupole phonon, which carries angular momentum $J=2$, can be constructed from a pair of fermions.
