When an electron scatters from a nucleon bound within a nucleus, the energy loss required differs from that of scattering from a free, stationary nucleon.

The scattered electron is detected at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the incident beam direction, and a proton of mass $M_p$ is knocked out of the nucleus. The reaction is $e+A \\to e'+p+B^*$, where the residual nucleus $B$ (with ground-state mass $M_B$) is left in a specific excited state with excitation energy $E_x$. The electron mass can be neglected ($m_e \\approx 0$).\n\nThe peak of the quasi-elastic energy loss spectrum, $\\omega_p$, corresponds to the kinematics where the interaction happens with a proton that is effectively stationary inside the nucleus. This is the static nucleon approximation, where the struck proton's initial momentum is taken to be zero. In this approximation, the residual nucleus does not recoil, i.e., its final momentum is zero.\n\nFor comparison, consider the case of elastic scattering of an electron with the same incident energy $E$ and scattering angle $\\theta$ off a free proton at rest.

The pn-SRC pair is initially at rest in the laboratory frame.

This problem delves into how Pauli blocking, even at finite temperatures, constrains the kinematically allowed region in the energy-momentum transfer plane, thereby defining the characteristic shape and position of the quasi-elastic peak in a many-body context [@problem_id:410768].", "problem": "In the theory of quasi-elastic electron scattering from a many-body system, the dynamic structure factor $S(q, \\omega)$ describes the probability of transferring momentum $\\hbar\\mathbf{q}$ and energy $\\hbar\\omega$ to the system. For a non-interacting gas of fermions (e.g., nucleons in a simple nuclear model) of mass $M$ at a finite temperature $T0$, the sharp boundaries of the allowed kinematic region in the $(\\omega, q)$-plane that exist at $T=0$ are smeared out. The response is instead concentrated in a \"quasi-elastic peak\".\n\nA reasonable model for the center of this peak is based on identifying the most probable scattering kinematics. This is determined by two main conditions:\n1.  **Statistical Condition:** The probability of scattering from a particle with initial energy $\\epsilon_p$ to a final energy $\\epsilon_{p'}$ is proportional to the product of the occupation probability of the initial state, $f(\\epsilon_p)$, and the un-occupation probability of the final state, $1-f(\\epsilon_{p'})$. Here $f(\\epsilon) = (e^{(\\epsilon-\\mu)/k_B T} + 1)^{-1}$ is the Fermi-Dirac distribution with chemical potential $\\mu$. This probability product is maximized when the transition is energetically symmetric about the chemical potential, i.e., when the initial energy is $\\epsilon_p = \\mu - \\hbar\\omega/2$.\n2.  **Kinematic Condition:** For a given momentum transfer $q = |\\mathbf{q}|$, the response $S(q, \\omega)$ is dominated by events where the initial momentum $\\mathbf{p}$ of the struck fermion is collinear with $\\mathbf{q}$.\n\nThe energy of a non-relativistic fermion is given by $\\epsilon_p = p^2/(2M)$, and the energy-momentum conservation for the scattering process is $\\hbar\\omega + \\epsilon_p = \\epsilon_{p+q}$, which simplifies to $\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{(\\hbar q)^2}{2M} + \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{q}}{M \\hbar}$.
