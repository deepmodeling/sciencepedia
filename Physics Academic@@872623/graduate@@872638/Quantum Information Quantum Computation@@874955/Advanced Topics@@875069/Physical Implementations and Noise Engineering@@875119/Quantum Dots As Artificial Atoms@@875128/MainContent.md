## Introduction
Semiconductor quantum dots represent a pinnacle of nano-engineering, earning the moniker "artificial atoms" for their remarkable ability to trap and control individual electrons in discrete, quantized energy levels. Unlike natural atoms, whose properties are fixed by the periodic table, the electronic, optical, and spin characteristics of a [quantum dot](@entry_id:138036) can be designed and tuned at will with external voltages. This unparalleled control has positioned them as a central building block for next-generation quantum technologies. The fundamental question this article addresses is: what are the physical principles that allow a tiny piece of semiconductor to so faithfully mimic the behavior of an atom, and how can we harness this mimicry for practical applications?

We begin our journey by examining the defining feature of a quantum dot: the quantum confinement that transforms a bulk semiconductor into a zero-dimensional artificial atom.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the fundamental principles and mechanisms that bestow semiconductor quantum dots with their characteristic "artificial atom" properties. We will transition from the foundational concept of quantum confinement to the complex interplay of [many-body interactions](@entry_id:751663), [light-matter coupling](@entry_id:196079), and environmental influences that govern their behavior. Our exploration will systematically build a theoretical framework, starting with single-particle descriptions and progressively incorporating the rich physics of Coulomb interactions, [quantum transport](@entry_id:138932), and decoherence.

### The Essence of Quantum Confinement

The defining characteristic of a quantum dot is the three-dimensional spatial confinement of charge carriers ([electrons and holes](@entry_id:274534)). This confinement leads to the [quantization of energy](@entry_id:137825), transforming the continuous energy bands of a bulk semiconductor into a discrete, atom-like spectrum of energy levels.

Quantum mechanical effects become dominant when the size of the confining region, characterized by a radius $R$, is comparable to or smaller than the carrier's de Broglie wavelength, $\lambda_{dB}$. Under this condition, the wave-like nature of the electron or hole is profoundly influenced by the boundaries of the dot. Mathematically, this is described by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation with boundary conditions imposed by the confinement potential. The result is a set of discrete [energy eigenvalues](@entry_id:144381) and corresponding eigenfunctions, analogous to the quantized orbitals of an atom [@problem_id:3011895].

To accurately model this, we employ the **Effective Mass Approximation (EMA)** and the **Envelope Function Formalism (EFF)**. The microscopic reality of a carrier inside a crystal involves its interaction with a complex, rapidly oscillating [periodic potential](@entry_id:140652) from the atomic lattice. The EMA and EFF provide a powerful simplification by replacing this intricate problem with a more tractable one: a "quasi-free" particle with an **effective mass** $m^*$ moving in a slowly varying confinement potential [@problem_id:3012021]. The effective mass, defined by the curvature of the semiconductor's energy band, $ (1/m^*)_{ij} = \frac{1}{\hbar^2} \frac{\partial^2 E(\mathbf{k})}{\partial k_i \partial k_j} $, encapsulates the effects of the periodic lattice potential. The electron's total wavefunction $\psi(\mathbf{r})$ is then approximated as a product of a slowly varying **[envelope function](@entry_id:749028)** $F(\mathbf{r})$ and the lattice-periodic part of the Bloch function $u_{\mathbf{k}_0}(\mathbf{r})$ at the band extremum: $\psi(\mathbf{r}) \approx F(\mathbf{r}) u_{\mathbf{k}_0}(\mathbf{r})$. The [envelope function](@entry_id:749028) $F(\mathbf{r})$ satisfies a Schrödinger-like equation:
$$ \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*} \nabla^2 + V_{conf}(\mathbf{r}) \right] F(\mathbf{r}) = E F(\mathbf{r}) $$
where $V_{conf}(\mathbf{r})$ is the macroscopic confinement potential of the dot and $E$ is the energy relative to the band edge. This approximation is justified when the confinement potential varies on a length scale much larger than the crystal's lattice constant and when the confinement energies are small compared to the material's band gap, minimizing coupling to other bands [@problem_id:3012021].

For these discrete levels to be experimentally observable, the energy spacing between them, $\Delta E$, must be significantly larger than any energy-broadening effects. Two primary sources of broadening are thermal energy, $k_B T$, and [lifetime broadening](@entry_id:274412). Thermal fluctuations can populate higher energy states and smear out spectral features, requiring $\Delta E \gg k_B T$. Furthermore, the coupling of the dot to external leads or other scattering channels limits the lifetime of a carrier in a given state, resulting in a [lifetime broadening](@entry_id:274412) $\hbar \Gamma$. Resolving discrete levels in transport spectroscopy thus requires weak coupling, such that $\hbar \Gamma \ll \Delta E$ [@problem_id:3011895] [@problem_id:3011858].

### Model Systems: Single-Particle Spectra and Symmetries

The precise structure of the [energy spectrum](@entry_id:181780) is determined by the geometry and nature of the confinement potential, $V_{conf}(\mathbf{r})$. Two idealized models are particularly instructive: the "hard-wall" potential, which assumes an infinite energy barrier at the dot's boundary, and the "soft-wall" potential, often modeled as a parabolic trap [@problem_id:3012040].

In a **hard-wall** circular dot of radius $R$, the potential is $V(r) = 0$ for $r  R$ and $V(r) = \infty$ otherwise. The physical requirement that the wavefunction cannot penetrate an infinite barrier imposes a Dirichlet boundary condition: the [envelope function](@entry_id:749028) must vanish at the boundary, $\psi(R, \theta) = 0$. The solutions to the radial Schrödinger equation are Bessel functions, and the boundary condition quantizes the allowed energy levels, which scale as $E \propto 1/R^2$. The energy spectrum is determined by the zeros of the Bessel functions [@problem_id:3012040].

In contrast, a **soft-wall** isotropic parabolic potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2}m^*\omega_0^2 r^2$, extends to infinity. Here, there is no sharp boundary. The physical requirement is that the eigenstates must be normalizable (square-integrable), meaning the wavefunction must vanish sufficiently fast as $r \to \infty$. This model is equivalent to the two-dimensional [quantum harmonic oscillator](@entry_id:140678). Its energy levels are equally spaced, $E_{n,m} = \hbar\omega_0(2n + |m| + 1)$, where $n$ is a radial quantum number and $m$ is the [angular momentum quantum number](@entry_id:172069). The energy scale is set by $\hbar\omega_0$, which is related to the characteristic confinement length $l_0 = \sqrt{\hbar/(m^*\omega_0)}$ via $\hbar\omega_0 = \hbar^2/(m^*l_0^2)$. Thus, like the hard-wall case, the energy spacing increases as the confinement size decreases, with a characteristic inverse-square dependence on the length scale ($E \sim 1/l_0^2$) [@problem_id:3012040] [@problem_id:3012049].

The symmetry of the potential dictates the degeneracy of the energy levels. The continuous [rotational symmetry](@entry_id:137077) of isotropic circular and parabolic dots leads to significant degeneracies. For instance, in the 2D [harmonic oscillator](@entry_id:155622), all states with the same [principal quantum number](@entry_id:143678) $N = n_x + n_y$ are degenerate. If this symmetry is broken, for example by an elliptical or rectangular confinement, these degeneracies are lifted. A small elliptical anisotropy in a parabolic dot, characterized by $\omega_x = \omega_0(1+\delta)$ and $\omega_y = \omega_0(1-\delta)$, splits the first excited shell by an amount proportional to the anisotropy parameter $\delta$, a direct manifestation of [symmetry breaking](@entry_id:143062) [@problem_id:3012049].

### Electrostatic Effects: Charging Energy and Coulomb Blockade

The single-particle picture is incomplete, as quantum dots contain multiple electrons that interact via the Coulomb force. The dominant effect of this interaction in many dots is captured by the concept of **[charging energy](@entry_id:141794)**. The **Constant Interaction (CI) model** provides a simple yet powerful framework for understanding this phenomenon. In this model, the total energy of a dot with $N$ electrons is the sum of the single-particle energies of the occupied orbitals and a classical electrostatic [charging energy](@entry_id:141794) that depends only on the total number of electrons, not their specific orbitals [@problem_id:3012018].

The [electrostatic energy](@entry_id:267406) can be derived by treating the dot as a conductor with a total capacitance $C$ to its surroundings, including a gate with capacitance $C_g$ at voltage $V_g$. The energy to place a charge $Q=-Ne$ on the dot, accounting for the work done by the gate voltage source, is given by:
$$ E_{elec}(N) = \frac{(-Ne + C_g V_g)^2}{2C} $$
Expanding this and discarding terms independent of the electron number $N$, we arrive at the interaction part of the CI model Hamiltonian. Defining the [charging energy](@entry_id:141794) $E_C = e^2/(2C)$ and the gate [lever arm](@entry_id:162693) $\alpha = C_g/C$, the total energy is:
$$ E(N) = \sum_{i=1}^N \epsilon_i + \frac{(Ne)^2}{2C} - N e \alpha V_g = \sum_{i=1}^N \epsilon_i + N^2 E_C - 2N E_C n_g $$
where $\epsilon_i$ are the single-particle energies and $n_g = C_g V_g / e$ is the dimensionless gate charge [@problem_id:3012018] [@problem_id:3012039].

This [charging energy](@entry_id:141794) has a profound and directly observable consequence in electron transport experiments: **Coulomb blockade**. When a quantum dot is placed between two electrodes (source and drain) to form a [single-electron transistor](@entry_id:142326), current can only flow if an electron can tunnel onto and then off the dot. The energy required to add the $N$-th electron is the **addition energy**, or electrochemical potential, $\mu(N) = E(N) - E(N-1)$. Within the CI model, this is approximately:
$$ \mu(N) \approx \epsilon_N + (2N-1)E_C - 2E_C n_g $$
For current to flow, $\mu(N)$ must lie within the bias window set by the source and drain chemical potentials, $[\mu_R, \mu_L]$. If the [charging energy](@entry_id:141794) $E_C$ is the dominant energy scale, there can be a range of gate voltages where adding or removing an electron is energetically forbidden at low source-drain bias $V$. This suppression of conductance is the Coulomb blockade. At the center of a blockade region (a "Coulomb diamond"), conduction is suppressed until the bias voltage is large enough to overcome the charging gap, requiring $e|V| \gtrsim 2E_C$. This phenomenon is only observable at temperatures low enough that thermal energy cannot bridge the gap, i.e., $k_B T \ll E_C$ [@problem_id:3012039].

### Quantum Mechanical Interactions: Shell Filling, Exchange, and Hund's Rule

Beyond the classical [charging energy](@entry_id:141794), the quantum mechanical nature of electrons dictates the filling of energy levels and gives rise to subtler interaction effects. Electrons are fermions and must obey the **Pauli exclusion principle**, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by all its [quantum numbers](@entry_id:145558), including spin. Therefore, each spatial orbital in a [quantum dot](@entry_id:138036) can be occupied by at most two electrons, one with spin-up and one with spin-down [@problem_id:3011920].

This principle governs the filling of the dot's [quantized energy levels](@entry_id:140911), leading to a **shell structure** analogous to that of real atoms. For an isotropic 2D parabolic dot, the energy shells are indexed by $s=0, 1, 2, \dots$. The $s$-th shell has an [orbital degeneracy](@entry_id:144305) of $s+1$, and with spin, a total capacity of $2(s+1)$. As electrons are added one by one, they fill these shells, leading to particularly stable configurations when a shell is completely filled. The total electron numbers corresponding to these closed shells are known as **magic numbers**: $N = 2, 6, 12, 20, \dots$. These shell closures are directly observable in Coulomb blockade experiments as unusually large peaks in the addition [energy spectrum](@entry_id:181780), as adding the next electron requires overcoming not only the [charging energy](@entry_id:141794) but also the large [single-particle energy](@entry_id:160812) gap to the next shell [@problem_id:3011981] [@problem_id:3011920].

When filling a partially occupied, degenerate shell, the **exchange interaction** becomes crucial. This is a purely quantum mechanical effect, with no classical analogue, arising from the requirement that the [many-body wavefunction](@entry_id:203043) be antisymmetric under [particle exchange](@entry_id:154910). It manifests as an effective [spin-spin interaction](@entry_id:173966). The energy of a two-electron state depends on the [total spin](@entry_id:153335). For two electrons in different orbitals $\psi_i$ and $\psi_j$, the Coulomb interaction energy for a spin-triplet state (parallel spins) is $U_{ij} - J_{ij}$, while for a [spin-singlet state](@entry_id:153133) it is $U_{ij} + J_{ij}$, where $U_{ij}$ is the direct Coulomb repulsion and $J_{ij}$ is the **[exchange integral](@entry_id:177036)**:
$$ J_{ij} = \iint \psi_i^*(\mathbf{r}) \psi_j^*(\mathbf{r}') \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} \psi_j(\mathbf{r}) \psi_i(\mathbf{r}') d^3r d^3r' $$
The [positive definite](@entry_id:149459) [exchange integral](@entry_id:177036) $J_{ij}$ thus favors parallel [spin alignment](@entry_id:140245). This leads to **Hund's first rule** in quantum dots: when filling [degenerate orbitals](@entry_id:154323), electrons will first occupy different orbitals with parallel spins to maximize the [total spin](@entry_id:153335), thereby lowering their energy via the [exchange interaction](@entry_id:140006). If the orbitals are nearly, but not perfectly, degenerate with a small splitting $\Delta$, a high-spin triplet ground state will be favored over a low-spin paired [singlet state](@entry_id:154728) provided the energy cost of promotion, $\Delta$, is less than the net gain in interaction energy: $\Delta  U_{ii} - U_{ij} + J_{ij}$ [@problem_id:3012068]. This exchange interaction is also responsible for the **fine-structure splitting** of [exciton](@entry_id:145621) states, where the degeneracy of [electron-hole pair](@entry_id:142506) states is lifted based on their relative spin orientation [@problem_id:716160].

### Excitons: The Optical Excitations of Quantum Dots

Quantum dots are not only analogous to atoms in their electronic structure but also in their interaction with light. The fundamental optical excitation in a semiconductor is an **exciton**: a [bound state](@entry_id:136872) of a negatively charged conduction-band electron and a positively charged valence-band hole, interacting via the screened Coulomb attraction. Quantum confinement profoundly modifies the properties of [excitons](@entry_id:147299) [@problem_id:3011969].

The physics is governed by the competition between the confinement length scale $R$ and the natural size of the exciton in the bulk material, the **effective Bohr radius** $a_B^*$.

In the **weak confinement regime** ($R \gg a_B^*$), the dot is much larger than the [exciton](@entry_id:145621). The electron and hole bind strongly to form a quasi-particle whose internal structure is nearly identical to that of a bulk [exciton](@entry_id:145621). The dot's main effect is to confine the [center-of-mass motion](@entry_id:747201) of this [exciton](@entry_id:145621) as a whole. The [exciton binding energy](@entry_id:138355) remains close to its bulk value, $E_B^{\text{bulk}}$.

In the **strong confinement regime** ($R \ll a_B^*$), the situation is reversed. The confinement energy dominates over the Coulomb interaction. The electron and hole are best described as individual particles, each occupying the quantized single-particle levels of the dot. Their mutual Coulomb attraction is then treated as a perturbation. A key result is that the [exciton binding energy](@entry_id:138355) (defined as the energy reduction due to the Coulomb attraction relative to the non-interacting electron and hole confinement energies) *increases* as the dot size decreases, typically scaling as $1/R$. The strong confinement forces the electron and hole to be in close proximity, enhancing their interaction [@problem_id:3011969] [@problem_id:3011895].

Confinement also alters the optical selection rules. In a bulk crystal, the [conservation of crystal momentum](@entry_id:184740) dictates that photons can only create or annihilate electron-hole pairs with nearly zero total momentum ($\mathbf{k}_e + \mathbf{k}_h \approx 0$). In a quantum dot, the breaking of [translational symmetry](@entry_id:171614) relaxes this rule. Instead, the transition probability is governed by the [overlap integral](@entry_id:175831) of the electron and hole envelope functions. For dots with high symmetry (e.g., spherical), the strongest transitions occur between electron and hole states that have the **same [envelope function](@entry_id:749028) symmetry**, particularly the same orbital angular momentum ($L_e = L_h$). This leads to dominant "s-to-s" and "p-to-p" transitions, in stark contrast to the $\Delta L = \pm 1$ rule for single-particle transitions within an atom [@problem_id:3011969].

### Quantum Transport Regimes

Transport measurements are a primary tool for probing the electronic structure of quantum dots. The nature of transport depends critically on the strength of the coupling to the external leads and the relevant [energy scales](@entry_id:196201).

In the **coherent transport** regime, where an electron's phase is preserved during its transit through the dot, the **Landauer-Büttiker formalism** provides a powerful description. The current is viewed as a transmission problem, where the net flow of electrons is determined by the transmission probability $T(E)$ and the difference in the Fermi-Dirac distributions of the leads:
$$ I = \frac{2e}{h} \int T(E) [f_L(E) - f_R(E)] dE $$
The factor of 2 accounts for spin. The transmission function $T(E)$ encapsulates the dot's properties. For a single resonant level at energy $\epsilon_d$ with total broadening $\Gamma = \Gamma_L + \Gamma_R$ due to coupling to the left and right leads, $T(E)$ takes a characteristic Breit-Wigner (Lorentzian) form:
$$ T(E) = \frac{\Gamma_L \Gamma_R}{(E - \epsilon_d)^2 + (\Gamma/2)^2} $$
This expression shows that [resonant tunneling](@entry_id:146897) occurs when the incident electron energy $E$ matches the dot's level energy $\epsilon_d$. The width of the resonance is determined by the total broadening $\Gamma$, which is a measure of the tunneling rates to the leads [@problem_id:3012053].

In the opposite limit of weak coupling and/or higher temperatures, transport is dominated by incoherent hopping events. This is the domain of the **master equation formalism**, which describes the time evolution of the probabilities of finding the dot in its various many-body charge and spin states. In the simplest case, transport occurs via **sequential tunneling**, where an electron tunnels from a lead onto the dot, followed by a separate event where an electron tunnels off the dot. These rates are calculated using Fermi's Golden Rule and are first-order in the tunnel coupling. When sequential tunneling is energetically forbidden by Coulomb blockade, a weaker, second-order process called **[cotunneling](@entry_id:144679)** can still mediate current. In [cotunneling](@entry_id:144679), an electron tunnels through the dot via a virtual intermediate state, which is energetically inaccessible. This process is crucial for explaining the small leakage current observed inside Coulomb diamonds [@problem_id:3011858].

### Coherence and its Loss: Decoherence Mechanisms

The potential of [quantum dots](@entry_id:143385) for [quantum information processing](@entry_id:158111) relies on the ability to create and maintain quantum coherence. Decoherence is the process by which a quantum system loses its "quantumness" due to entanglement with its environment. The characteristic time scales for this loss are the coherence times **$T_1$ ([energy relaxation](@entry_id:136820))** and **$T_2$ (dephasing)**.

Operationally, for a two-level qubit system (spin or charge), $T_1$ is the time scale for the population difference between the two states to decay to its thermal equilibrium value. It represents the lifetime of the excited state. $T_2$ is the time scale for the decay of the [quantum phase coherence](@entry_id:268397) between the two states, i.e., the decay of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix. $T_2$ is always less than or equal to $2T_1$, as any [energy relaxation](@entry_id:136820) event ($T_1$ process) also destroys [phase coherence](@entry_id:142586). Pure [dephasing](@entry_id:146545) refers to the loss of phase without any energy exchange.

The dominant decoherence mechanisms are highly dependent on the qubit type and the host material [@problem_id:3011940]:

*   **Spin Qubits:**
    *   In **Group III-V materials** (e.g., GaAs), the host lattice is composed of atoms with non-zero nuclear spins. The primary source of [dephasing](@entry_id:146545) is the **[hyperfine interaction](@entry_id:152228)** between the [electron spin](@entry_id:137016) and this fluctuating bath of nuclear spins, which creates an effective magnetic field (the Overhauser field) that varies in time and space. This severely limits $T_2$. Energy relaxation ($T_1$) is much slower and is typically mediated by the coupling of the spin to lattice vibrations (phonons) via the spin-orbit interaction.
    *   In **Group-IV materials**, particularly isotopically enriched silicon ($^{28}$Si), which has zero [nuclear spin](@entry_id:151023), the [hyperfine interaction](@entry_id:152228) is eliminated. This leads to exceptionally long spin coherence times. The remaining dephasing is often caused by **charge noise** (fluctuations in the electrostatic environment) which couples to the spin via residual spin-orbit interaction, valley effects, or magnetic field gradients.

*   **Charge Qubits:**
    *   Charge qubits, which encode information in the spatial location of an electron (e.g., in a double dot), have a large [electric dipole moment](@entry_id:161272). This makes them extremely sensitive to electric field fluctuations. The dominant decoherence mechanism is **charge noise**, which causes fluctuations in the energy levels and leads to rapid [dephasing](@entry_id:146545) ($T_2$). This noise often exhibits a **$1/f$ [power spectrum](@entry_id:159996)**, which is particularly detrimental at low frequencies. Energy relaxation ($T_1$) is also relatively fast, typically limited by the spontaneous emission of a phonon.

The ubiquitous $1/f$ charge noise is believed to originate from an ensemble of **two-level fluctuators (TLFs)** in the device's environment, such as charge traps at semiconductor-dielectric interfaces. A single TLF switching randomly between two charge states produces **[random telegraph noise](@entry_id:269610) (RTN)** with a Lorentzian power spectrum. The superposition of many such fluctuators with a broad, flat distribution of switching rates gives rise to the characteristic $1/f$ spectrum over a wide frequency range [@problem_id:3012019].

### Advanced Topics and Material-Specific Properties

**Wigner Molecules:** In the limit of very low electron density (or weak confinement), the Coulomb repulsion can completely overwhelm the kinetic energy. In this regime, electrons abandon their delocalized orbital character and "crystallize" into a spatially ordered, rotating configuration known as a **Wigner molecule**. This state minimizes the formidable Coulomb energy by maximizing the inter-electron distances. The low-energy excitations of a Wigner molecule are collective rotations and vibrations of this quasi-rigid electron arrangement [@problem_id:3012050].

**Double Quantum Dots (DQDs):** A DQD consists of two [quantum dots](@entry_id:143385) coupled by a tunnel barrier. When an electron can tunnel between a localized state $|L\rangle$ on the left dot and $|R\rangle$ on the right dot with a tunnel coupling amplitude $t_c$, the two states hybridize. This hybridization lifts the degeneracy and forms a lower-energy **bonding** state, $(\lvert L\rangle + \lvert R\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$, and a higher-energy **antibonding** state, $(\lvert L\rangle - \lvert R\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$, separated by an energy of $2t_c$. This tunable two-level system is a fundamental building block for many types of spin and charge qubits [@problem_id:3011867].

**Spin-Orbit Interaction (SOI):** In materials lacking inversion symmetry, a relativistic effect couples an electron's spin to its momentum. In [semiconductor heterostructures](@entry_id:142914), two main types arise: **Dresselhaus interaction**, originating from the [bulk inversion asymmetry](@entry_id:144119) (BIA) of the crystal lattice (e.g., zinc-blende), and **Rashba interaction**, originating from [structural inversion asymmetry](@entry_id:138910) (SIA) of the confinement potential itself. These interactions are crucial as they allow for the electrical control of electron spins, but they also act as a decoherence mechanism by mixing spin and orbital states [@problem_id:3011975].

**Valley Physics in Silicon:** The conduction band of silicon features six equivalent energy minima, or "valleys." In a Si quantum dot at a (001) interface, strain and [quantum confinement](@entry_id:136238) typically lift this degeneracy, leaving a two-fold **[valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132)** corresponding to the two valleys oriented along the growth axis. The sharp potential at the interface can couple these two valley states, lifting the final degeneracy and creating a **valley splitting**. This energy splitting is a critical parameter for silicon-based [spin qubits](@entry_id:200319), as a small splitting can interfere with qubit operations [@problem_id:3011924].

**Fabrication and Built-in Fields:** Quantum dots can be fabricated in many ways. Self-assembled dots, such as InAs on GaAs, form naturally via the **Stranski-Krastanov growth mode**, where lattice mismatch between two materials induces strain that is relieved by the formation of 3D islands on top of a thin [wetting](@entry_id:147044) layer. This strain, in [non-centrosymmetric materials](@entry_id:181206) like GaAs, also generates strong built-in **piezoelectric fields**, which significantly modify the shape and depth of the confinement potential and can spatially separate [electrons and holes](@entry_id:274534) [@problem_id:3011979]. This piezoelectric coupling also provides a mechanism for electrons to interact with both longitudinal and transverse [acoustic phonons](@entry_id:141298), contributing to relaxation and decoherence [@problem_id:3011876].
