It utilizes a three-dimensional cluster state, where computation proceeds through a sequence of adaptive single-qubit measurements. The resilience of this scheme to errors can be analyzed by mapping the physical error model to an effective statistical mechanics model. The fault-tolerance threshold corresponds to a phase transition in this model, beyond which errors can be corrected. For the RHG lattice, the physical error process is often mapped to a 3D Z2 random plaquette gauge theory.\n\nThe threshold for a simple noise model of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) single-photon loss, occurring with probability $p$, is a known benchmark value, $p_c$. Specifically, the scheme is fault-tolerant if $p < p_c$.\n\n**Problem Setup:**\nIn this problem, we investigate a more complex, structured error model that introduces spacetime correlations, which are common in photonic architectures. We model errors occurring during the creation of the RHG cluster state. The cluster state's qubits are located at the vertices of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice, and entanglement is generated by applying Controlled-Z (CZ) gates between all nearest-neighbor pairs.\n\nThe error correction mechanism relies on measuring local stabilizers, which correspond to plaquettes of the dual lattice. A physical error event causes a characteristic set of these plaquettes to \"flip\", creating a detectable syndrome. The overall fault-tolerance is determined by the effective probability, $P_{flip}$, that an arbitrary single plaquette is flipped. The threshold for our correlated model, $\\epsilon_{th}$, is reached when this effective probability equals the critical i.i.d. loss probability, i.e., $P_{flip}(\\epsilon_{th}) = p_c$.\n\n**Correlated Noise Model:**\nWe consider a single source of error: faults during the entangling CZ gates.\n- For each nearest-neighbor pair of photons $(i, j)$ in the BCC lattice, a CZ gate is applied.\n- Each gate fails with a probability $\\epsilon$.\n- A single gate failure between photons $i$ and $j$ is a correlated event that causes **both** photons $i$ and $j$ to be lost from the lattice. No other errors occur.\n\n**Geometric and Error Mapping:**\nYou are given the following established properties of the RHG lattice and the mapping from photon loss to plaquette flips. You must take these as given facts for your derivation.\n1.  The photons (qubits) reside on the vertices of a primal BCC lattice. The coordination number (number of nearest neighbors) of any vertex in a BCC lattice is $z=8$.\n2.  The error-syndrome plaquettes reside on the faces of the dual lattice.\n3.  The loss of a single photon at a primal vertex $v$ flips a specific set of $12$ surrounding dual plaquettes. Let's denote this set of plaquettes by $S_v$.\n4.  Each dual plaquette $P$ is uniquely associated with a pair of nearest-neighbor vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$, in the primal BCC lattice. This association means that $P \\in S_{v_1}$ and $P \\in S_{v_2}$, and for any other vertex $v' \\notin \\{v_1, v_2\\}$, $P \\notin S_{v'}$.\n\n**Derivation Task:**\nBased on the correlated noise model and the geometric mapping provided, derive an expression for the fault-tolerance threshold $\\epsilon_{th}$ in terms of the benchmark i.i.d. threshold $p_c$.", "solution": "We label the two primal vertices of the plaquette by $v_1$ and $v_2$.
