However, the physical implementation allows for leakage into a single, orthogonal \"leaked\" state $|L\\rangle$ for each qubit, such that $\\langle L|0\\rangle = \\langle L|1\\rangle = 0$.\n\nThe system is initialized in the state $|00\\rangle$. This state is a $+1$ eigenstate of the two-qubit Pauli operator $S = Z_1 Z_2$. Immediately after initialization, qubit 1 is subject to a leakage error. With probability $1-p$, its state is unaffected. With probability $p$, its state is projected into the leaked state $|L_1\\rangle$. This process results in a statistical mixture where the system is in state $|00\\rangle$ with probability $1-p$ and in state $|L_1 0\\rangle$ with probability $p$.\n\nFollowing this potential error, a non-demolition measurement of the stabilizer $S = Z_1 Z_2$ is performed to detect errors. The measurement circuit uses a single ancilla qubit, initialized to $|0\\rangle_a$. The sequence of operations is:\n1.  Apply a Hadamard gate to the ancilla ($H_a$).\n2.  Apply a Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate with qubit 1 as control and the ancilla as target ($C_{1a}$).\n3.  Apply a CNOT gate with qubit 2 as control and the ancilla as target ($C_{2a}$).\n4.  Apply a Hadamard gate to the ancilla ($H_a$).\n5.  Measure the ancilla in the $Z$-basis ($\\{|0\\rangle_a, |1\\rangle_a\\}$).\n\nThe measurement outcome '0' corresponds to the $+1$ eigenspace of $S$, and '1' corresponds to the $-1$ eigenspace. Since the ideal state $|00\\rangle$ has a $+1$ eigenvalue for $S$, an ancilla outcome of '1' represents an incorrect syndrome.\n\nThe physical behavior of the CNOT gates depends on the state of the control qubit.\n- If the control qubit is in the computational subspace, the CNOT gate functions normally ($|c,t\\rangle \\to |c, t \\oplus c\\rangle$).\n- If the control qubit is in the leaked state $|L\\rangle$, the gate interaction causes a complete depolarization of the target qubit.
