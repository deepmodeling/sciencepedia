This first exercise establishes a quantitative understanding of this phenomenon by calculating the \"blockade radius,\" the characteristic length scale governing the interaction.

This phenomenon is used to create controlled interactions for implementing two-qubit quantum gates. Consider a system of two identical atoms, initially in their ground state and separated by a distance $R$. A laser system is used to excite these atoms to a specific high-lying electronic state, known as a Rydberg state.\n\nWhen both atoms are simultaneously in this Rydberg state, they experience a strong, long-range van der Waals interaction. This interaction shifts their collective energy level. The potential energy for this interaction can be effectively modeled by the expression $V(R) = -C_6/R^6$, where $C_6$ is a positive constant known as the van der Waals coefficient, which depends on the specific Rydberg state chosen.\n\nThe Rydberg blockade effect arises when this interaction energy shift is significant enough to detune the second atom from the laser's resonance, thereby preventing its excitation. A standard criterion for the onset of a strong blockade is when the magnitude of the interaction energy, $|V(R)|$, is equal to the energy uncertainty of the Rydberg state. This energy uncertainty, also called the natural linewidth, is fundamentally linked to the finite lifetime of the state, denoted by $\\tau$.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the \"blockade radius,\" $R_b$. This is defined as the specific interatomic distance at which the magnitude of the van der Waals interaction energy is precisely equal to the natural linewidth of the Rydberg state (expressed in energy units). Your final expression should be in terms of the van der Waals coefficient $C_6$, the lifetime of the state $\\tau$, and the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$.", "solution": "The pairwise interaction between two atoms both in the Rydberg state is modeled as a van der Waals potential\n$$\nV(R) = -\\frac{C_{6}}{R^{6}}.\n$$\nIts magnitude is\n$$\n|V(R)| = \\frac{C_{6}}{R^{6}}.\n$$\nThe blockade condition is that the interaction-induced energy shift equals the natural linewidth (energy uncertainty) of the Rydberg state.
