It can be specified by a $k \\times n$ generator matrix $G$, whose rows form a basis for the code $C$. Any codeword $c \\in C$ can be written as $c = uG$ for some message vector $u \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^k$. The dimension $k$ of the code is the rank of its generator matrix $G$.\n\nThe CSS construction uses two classical linear codes, $C_1$ and $C_2$, both with the same block length $n$. Let $C_1$ be an $[n, k_1]$ code with generator matrix $G_1$, and $C_2$ be an $[n, k_2]$ code with generator matrix $G_2$. A valid CSS code, denoted $CSS(C_1, C_2)$, can be constructed if $C_2$ is a subcode of $C_1$, i.e., $C_2 \\subset C_1$. This condition is satisfied if every generator of $C_2$ is a codeword in $C_1$.\n\nThe resulting quantum code is an $[[n, k, d]]$ code, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits, $k$ is the number of encoded (logical) qubits, and $d$ is the code distance. The number of logical qubits for a valid CSS code is given by the formula $k = k_1 - k_2$.\n\nConsider two classical binary codes, $C_1$ and $C_2$, with block length $n=7$, defined by the following generator matrices:\n$$\nG_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nand\n$$\nG_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nVerify that these codes can be used to construct a valid CSS code and determine the number of logical qubits, $k$, for the resulting $CSS(C_1, C_2)$ code.", "solution": "To construct a valid CSS code $CSS(C_1, C_2)$, the condition $C_2 \\subset C_1$ must hold, meaning every codeword in $C_2$ must also be a codeword in $C_1$.

By inspection, we can see that adding the first and third rows of $G_1$ (modulo 2) yields $v_1$:\n$r_1 + r_3 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0) + (0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1) = (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1) = v_1$.\nSo, $v_1 \\in C_1$.\n\nSecond, check if $v_2$ is in $C_1$. By inspection, we can see that adding the second and fourth rows of $G_1$ (modulo 2) yields $v_2$:\n$r_2 + r_4 = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1) + (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1) = (0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0) = v_2$.\nSo, $v_2 \\in C_1$.\n\nSince both generators of $C_2$ are in $C_1$, the condition $C_2 \\subset C_1$ is satisfied, and a valid $CSS(C_1, C_2)$ code can be constructed.\n\nNext, we determine the dimensions of the classical codes, $k_1$ and $k_2$. The dimension is the rank of the generator matrix, which is the number of linearly independent rows.\n- For $G_1$, the first four columns form an identity matrix, which guarantees that the four rows are linearly independent. Thus, $k_1 = \\text{rank}(G_1) = 4$.\n- For $G_2$, the two rows are clearly not multiples of each other, so they are linearly independent. Thus, $k_2 = \\text{rank}(G_2) = 2$.\n\nThe number of logical qubits in the resulting quantum code is $k = k_1 - k_2$.\n$k = 4 - 2 = 2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "146673"}, {"introduction": "Once a CSS code is constructed, its logical states are defined as specific superpositions of classical codewords.

However, a decoder's guess about the physical error can be incorrect, leading to a logical error that corrupts the encoded information. This final practice problem [@problem_id:146576] delves into this critical failure mechanism by asking you to find the minimum-weight physical error that a perfect decoder will miscorrect, providing deep insight into the performance limits of the code.", "problem": "The $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code is a quantum error-correcting code that encodes one logical qubit into seven physical qubits and can correct any single-qubit error. It is a type of Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code built upon the classical $[7,4,3]$ Hamming code.\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, we will only consider Pauli-$X$ errors and their correction. The error detection for this type of error is performed by measuring the Z-type stabilizer generators. A standard choice for these generators is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ng_1 &= Z_1 Z_3 Z_5 Z_7 \\\\\ng_2 &= Z_2 Z_3 Z_6 Z_7 \\\\\ng_3 &= Z_4 Z_5 Z_6 Z_7\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $Z_i$ is the Pauli-Z operator on qubit $i$. A physical Pauli-$X$ error, $E = \\prod_{i \\in S} X_i$, where $S$ is a subset of the qubit indices $\\{1, ..., 7\\}$, is detected by checking if it commutes or anti-commutes with each of these stabilizers. This produces a 3-bit syndrome vector $s = (s_1, s_2, s_3)$, where $s_j=1$ if $E$ anti-commutes with $g_j$, and $s_j=0$ if it commutes.\n\nA minimum-weight perfect decoder operates as follows: given a syndrome $s$, it identifies the set of all Pauli-X operators that produce $s$. From this set, it selects an operator $R$ with the minimum possible weight (i.e., acting on the minimum number of qubits) and applies its inverse $R^{-1}$ (which for Pauli operators is $R$ itself) as the recovery operation.\n\nA miscorrection occurs if the net operation, $R^{-1}E$, is not an element of the stabilizer group. We are interested in a specific type of failure where the net operation is a non-trivial logical-X operator. A logical-X operator is a Pauli operator of the form $\\prod_{i \\in C} X_i$ that commutes with all stabilizer generators (both X- and Z-type) but is not a stabilizer itself. For the Steane code, the minimum weight of a non-trivial logical-X operator is 3.\n\nDetermine the minimum weight of a physical Pauli-$X$ error, $E$, that a minimum-weight perfect decoder will miscorrect into a non-trivial logical-X operator.", "solution": "A logical failure occurs when the applied recovery operation, $R$, combined with the initial error, $E$, results in a non-trivial logical operator, $L$. For Pauli-X operators, this means $R \\cdot E = L$. A minimum-weight perfect decoder will choose the recovery operator $R$ that has the smallest weight among all operators that produce the observed syndrome.\n\n1.  **Define the Operators**: Let $E$ be the physical error, $R$ be the recovery operation chosen by the decoder, and $L$ be a minimum-weight logical-X operator for the Steane code. The weight of $L$ is $|L|=3$. The miscorrection condition is $E = R \\cdot L$. The supports of these operators are related by $\\text{supp}(E) = \\text{supp}(R) \\oplus \\text{supp}(L)$ (symmetric difference).\n\n2.  **Syndrome Equivalence**: The syndrome of the error $E$ is determined by its commutation relations with the Z-stabilizers. Since a logical operator $L$ commutes with all stabilizers by definition, $E$ and $R$ produce the exact same syndrome. Therefore, if $|R|  |E|$, a minimum-weight decoder observing the syndrome of $E$ will incorrectly choose to apply the recovery $R$.\n\n3.  **Analyze Weights**: Let $r = |R|$ be the weight of the recovery and $w_E = |E|$ be the weight of the error. The relationship between the weights is given by $w_E = |R| + |L| - 2|\\text{supp}(R) \\cap \\text{supp}(L)|$. For the Steane code, $|L|=3$, so $w_E = r + 3 - 2k$, where $k = |\\text{supp}(R) \\cap \\text{supp}(L)|$.\n\n4.  **Find Minimum Weight**: We want to find the smallest integer $w_E > 0$ that satisfies the miscorrection condition $|R|  |E|$, or $r  r + 3 - 2k$. This simplifies to $2k  3$, which means the intersection size $k$ can be 0 or 1.\n    - To minimize $w_E$, we should choose the smallest possible non-zero recovery weight $r$ and the largest possible intersection $k$.\n    - The smallest possible recovery weight for a non-trivial syndrome is $r=1$ (corresponding to a single-qubit error).\n    - The largest possible intersection is $k=1$.\n    - Plugging these values in, we get the minimum error weight: $w_E = 1 + 3 - 2(1) = 2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: A physical error of weight 2 can have the same syndrome as a physical error of weight 1. The decoder corrects for the weight-1 error, leaving a residual error that is a logical operator. Since the code can correct all weight-1 errors, the minimum weight for a miscorrection of this type is 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "146576"}]}
