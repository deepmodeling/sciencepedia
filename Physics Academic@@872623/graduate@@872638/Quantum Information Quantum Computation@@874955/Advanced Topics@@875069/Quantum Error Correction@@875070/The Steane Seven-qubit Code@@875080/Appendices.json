A logical qubit is encoded in seven physical qubits.

This circuit consists of the following gates applied in sequence:\n1. Hadamard gates on qubits 1, 2, and 4.\n2. A series of Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates, where $CNOT(c,t)$ has control qubit $c$ and target qubit $t$:\n   - $CNOT(1,3)$, $CNOT(1,5)$, $CNOT(1,7)$\n   - $CNOT(2,3)$, $CNOT(2,6)$, $CNOT(2,7)$\n   - $CNOT(4,5)$, $CNOT(4,6)$, $CNOT(4,7)$\n\nThis circuit implements the transformation $U_{enc}|0000000\\rangle = |0\\rangle_L$.\n\nSuppose there is a preparation error, and the initial state of the seven physical qubits is $|\\psi_{in}\\rangle = |1000000\\rangle$ instead of $|0000000\\rangle$. The encoding circuit $U_{enc}$ is then applied to this faulty initial state, producing the final state $|\\psi\\rangle = U_{enc}|\\psi_{in}\\rangle$.\n\nCalculate the fidelity $F$ between the ideal logical zero state $|0\\rangle_L$ and the resulting state $|\\psi\\rangle$.

Let's find $E'$.\n\nThe circuit first applies Hadamards, then CNOTs. Propagating $X_1$ through the circuit:\n1. $X_1$ is before $H_1, H_2, H_4$. It commutes with $H_2, H_4$. It passes through $H_1$ to become $Z_1$. So, after the Hadamards, the effective error is $Z_1$.\n2. Now, propagate $Z_1$ through the CNOTs:\n   - $Z_1$ passes through $CNOT(1,3)$, affecting the target: $Z_1 \\rightarrow Z_1 Z_3$.\n   - $Z_1 Z_3$ passes through $CNOT(1,5)$: $Z_1 Z_3 \\rightarrow Z_1 Z_3 Z_5$.\n   - $Z_1 Z_3 Z_5$ passes through $CNOT(1,7)$: $Z_1 Z_3 Z_5 \\rightarrow Z_1 Z_3 Z_5 Z_7$.\n   - This operator commutes with all subsequent CNOTs which have controls on qubits 2 and 4.\nSo, the final effective error is $E' = Z_1 Z_3 Z_5 Z_7$. This is one of the stabilizer generators, $g_6$.\n\nThe fidelity calculation becomes:\n$$\nF = |\\langle 0_L | E' | 0_L \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 0_L | g_6 | 0_L \\rangle|^2\n$$\nSince $|0\\rangle_L$ is a state in the codespace, it is stabilized by all stabilizer generators. This means $g_6 |0\\rangle_L = |0\\rangle_L$.\nTherefore, the inner product is:\n$$\n\\langle 0_L | g_6 | 0_L \\rangle = \\langle 0_L | 0_L \\rangle = 1\n$$\nAnd the fidelity is:\n$$\nF = |1|^2 = 1\n$$\nThis result might seem surprising. It shows that for this specific encoding circuit, an initial bit-flip on qubit 1 is transformed into a stabilizer operator, which has no effect on the logical state. However, the calculation in the original solution gives 0. Let's re-check that original calculation.\n\nOriginal solution check: The state after hadamards is correctly identified as having a `(-1)^a` phase. The final state is correctly derived as $|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\sum_{c \\in C^\\perp} (-1)^{c_1} |c\\rangle$. The inner product $\\langle 0_L | \\psi \\rangle$ is correctly computed as $\\frac{1}{8} \\sum_{c \\in C^\\perp} (-1)^{c_1}$. The codewords of $C^\\perp$ are listed, and it's found that 4 have $c_1=0$ and 4 have $c_1=1$. The sum is $4 \\times (+1) + 4 \\times (-1) = 0$. The fidelity is 0.\n\nSo which result is correct, 0 or 1? My propagation method $E' = U_{enc} X_1 U_{enc}^\\dagger$ is standard. Let's re-propagate.\n$X_1 \\xrightarrow{H_1} Z_1$.\n$Z_1 \\xrightarrow{CNOT(1,3)} Z_1Z_3$.\n$Z_1Z_3 \\xrightarrow{CNOT(1,5)} Z_1Z_3Z_5$.\n$Z_1Z_3Z_5 \\xrightarrow{CNOT(1,7)} Z_1Z_3Z_5Z_7$.\nThis is $g_6$, a stabilizer. So $\\langle 0_L | E' | 0_L \\rangle = \\langle 0_L | g_6 | 0_L \\rangle = 1$. The fidelity should be 1.\n\nLet's re-check the \"original\" solution's logic.\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\sum_{c \\in C^\\perp} (-1)^{c_1} |c\\rangle$. This state is $Z_1 |0\\rangle_L$. Why? Because $|0\\rangle_L = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\sum |c\\rangle$, so $Z_1|0\\rangle_L = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\sum Z_1|c\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\sum (-1)^{c_1}|c\\rangle$.\nSo the state created is $Z_1 |0\\rangle_L$.\nThe fidelity is $F = |\\langle 0_L | Z_1 | 0_L \\rangle|^2$.\nIs $\\langle 0_L | Z_1 | 0_L \\rangle = 0$? Yes. $Z_1$ is a logical operator for the code (or related to one), not a stabilizer. It anti-commutes with $X$-type stabilizer $g_3 = X_1 X_3 X_5 X_7$.\nSince $|0\\rangle_L$ is a $+1$ eigenstate of $g_3$, then $Z_1|0\\rangle_L$ is a $-1$ eigenstate of $g_3$.\nSo $Z_1|0\\rangle_L$ is orthogonal to $|0\\rangle_L$, and the inner product is 0.\n\nWhere did my propagation go wrong?\nAh, the propagation rule $U_{CNOT} Z_c U_{CNOT}^\\dagger = Z_c Z_t$ is for control 'c'. Here, the error $Z_1$ is on the control qubit. Yes, that rule is correct. What about the other way? $U_{CNOT} Z_t U_{CNOT}^\\dagger = Z_t$. My propagation seems correct.\nLet's look at the circuit again. $H$ gates on 1,2,4. CNOTs (1,3), (1,5), (1,7), (2,3), (2,6), (2,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7).\nInitial error $X_1$.\nAfter H-gates, error is $Z_1$.\nAfter $CNOT(1,3)$, error is $Z_1 Z_3$.\nAfter $CNOT(1,5)$, error is $Z_1 Z_3 Z_5$.\nAfter $CNOT(1,7)$, error is $Z_1 Z_3 Z_5 Z_7$. This is $g_6$.\nAfter $CNOT(2,3)$, error is $g_6$. It commutes with $CNOT(2,3)$, since $Z$ on target commutes.\nMy propagation result $E'=g_6$ seems robust.\n\nWhy does the state evolution give $Z_1|0\\rangle_L$?\nThe ideal circuit makes $|0\\rangle_L = U_{enc} |000\\rangle$.\n$|0\\rangle_L = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\sum_{a,b,d} |a,b,a\\oplus b, d, a\\oplus d, b\\oplus d, a\\oplus b \\oplus d\\rangle$. This is the standard generation of $C^\\perp$. Correct.\nThe faulty circuit starts with $|100\\rangle$ on qubits 1,2,4. This is the state $|1\\rangle_1 \\otimes |0\\rangle_2 \\otimes |0\\rangle_4$.\nAfter H-gates: $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle_1-|1\\rangle_1) \\otimes \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle_2+|1\\rangle_2) \\otimes \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle_4+|1\\rangle_4)$.\nThis is a superposition of $|a,b,d\\rangle$ states with phase $(-1)^a$.\nThe CNOTs then map $|a,b,d\\rangle$ to the corresponding codeword $|c(a,b,d)\\rangle$.\nSo the final state is $\\sum_{a,b,d} (-1)^a |c(a,b,d)\\rangle$ (up to normalization).\nThis is $\\sum_{c \\in C^\\perp} (-1)^{c_1} |c\\rangle$, since $c_1=a$. This is correct.\nThis state is indeed proportional to $Z_1 |0\\rangle_L$.\nOkay, the state evolution calculation is correct. My error propagation calculation must be wrong.\nWhere? $U_{enc} = U_{CNOTs} U_{H}$. $|\\psi\\rangle = U_{CNOTs} U_H X_1 |0\\rangle^{\\otimes 7} = U_{CNOTs} Z_1 U_H |0\\rangle^{\\otimes 7}$. This seems ok.\n$U_{CNOTs} Z_1 U_{H} |0\\rangle^{\\otimes 7} = (U_{CNOTs} Z_1 U_{CNOTs}^\\dagger) U_{CNOTs} U_H |0\\rangle^{\\otimes 7} = E'_{CNOTs} |0\\rangle_L$.\n$E'_{CNOTs}$ is the propagation of $Z_1$ through the CNOT part of the circuit.\nWait, my propagation was $E' = U_{enc} X_1 U_{enc}^\\dagger = U_{CNOTs} U_H X_1 U_H^\\dagger U_{CNOTs}^\\dagger = U_{CNOTs} Z_1 U_{CNOTs}^\\dagger$.\nLet's check the CNOTs again. $Z_1$ is on control 1.\nCNOTs with control 1 are (1,3), (1,5), (1,7).\n$Z_1 \\xrightarrow{CNOT(1,3)} Z_1Z_3$. Yes.\n$Z_1Z_3 \\xrightarrow{CNOT(1,5)} Z_1Z_3Z_5$. Yes.\n$Z_1Z_3Z_5 \\xrightarrow{CNOT(1,7)} Z_1Z_3Z_5Z_7$. Yes.\nThe resulting operator $g_6 = Z_1Z_3Z_5Z_7$ must then pass through the CNOTs with controls 2 and 4.\n$g_6$ commutes with $CNOT(2,3)$? Error $Z_3$ is on target of $CNOT(2,3)$. $U Z_t U^\\dagger = Z_t$. Commutes. OK.\n$g_6$ commutes with $CNOT(2,6)$? Error $Z_6$ is on target. Commutes. OK.\n$g_6$ commutes with $CNOT(2,7)$? Error $Z_7$ is on target. Commutes. OK.\n$g_6$ commutes with $CNOT(4,5)$? Error $Z_5$ is on target. Commutes. OK.\n$g_6$ commutes with $CNOT(4,6)$? Error $Z_6$ is on target. Commutes. OK.\n$g_6$ commutes with $CNOT(4,7)$? Error $Z_7$ is on target. Commutes. OK.\nSo my error propagation calculation $E'=g_6$ seems correct. This implies Fidelity=1.\n\nLet's trust the direct state calculation. It's more fundamental. The resulting state is $Z_1 |0\\rangle_L$. The fidelity with $|0\\rangle_L$ is $|\\langle 0_L|Z_1|0\\rangle_L|^2 = 0$. The original solution is correct in its conclusion, although its expansion of the superposition sum was a bit tedious. I will keep the original solution.\n\nFinal plan confirmed. Assign score 6. Write reflection. Make the specified scientific and formatting corrections. Do not change solution 2 or 3.
