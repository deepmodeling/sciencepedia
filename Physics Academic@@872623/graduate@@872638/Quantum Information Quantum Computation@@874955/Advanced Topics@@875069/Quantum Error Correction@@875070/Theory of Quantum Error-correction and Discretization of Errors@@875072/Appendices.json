A CSS code over $n$ qubits is defined if $C_2^\\perp \\subseteq C_1$, where $C_2^\\perp$ is the dual code of $C_2$. The resulting quantum code, denoted a $[[n, k, d]]$ code, has $k = k_1 + k_2 - n$ logical qubits, where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are the dimensions of $C_1$ and $C_2$ respectively.\n\nErrors are detected by measuring stabilizer generators. For a CSS code with $C_1$ and $C_2$, the stabilizers are generated by operators of the form $X(c)$ for $c \\in C_2^\\perp$ and $Z(c')$ for $c' \\in C_1^\\perp$. Here, for a binary vector $v=(v_1, \\dots, v_n)$, $X(v) = \\otimes_{i=1}^n X_i^{v_i}$ and $Z(v) = \\otimes_{i=1}^n Z_i^{v_i}$.\n\nThe syndrome of an error is determined by its commutation relations with the stabilizer generators. An error of the form $E = X(a)Z(b)$, where $a, b \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$, yields two syndrome vectors. The bit-flip syndrome $s_Z$ is measured by the $Z$-type stabilizers and is given by $s_Z = H_1 a^T$, where $H_1$ is the parity-check matrix of $C_1$. The phase-flip syndrome $s_X$ is measured by the $X$-type stabilizers and is given by $s_X = H_2 b^T$, where $H_2$ is the parity-check matrix for $C_2$. All calculations are performed modulo 2.\n\nConsider the CSS code constructed using the classical [7,4,3] Hamming code for both $C_1$ and $C_2$ (i.e., $C_1 = C_2 = C_{Ham}$).
