Solving this will reveal the theoretical origin of one of the most famous and efficient quantum codes, a cornerstone of the field [@problem_id:177472].", "problem": "In the theory of quantum error correction, a quantum code that encodes $k$ logical qubits into $n$ physical qubits and can correct any error on up to $t$ physical qubits is denoted as an $[[n, k, d]]$ code, where $d$ is the code distance, related to $t$ by $t = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor$. The fundamental types of errors on a single qubit are represented by the Pauli operators $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.\n\nFor a non-degenerate stabilizer code, the properties $(n, k, t)$ are constrained by the Quantum Hamming Bound (also known as the quantum sphere-packing bound). This bound arises from a dimension-counting argument, requiring that the $2^k$-dimensional logical codespace and all the unique error-transformed subspaces (corresponding to correctable errors) fit within the total $2^n$-dimensional Hilbert space of the physical qubits. The bound is given by:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{t} \\binom{n}{j} 3^j \\le 2^{n-k}\n$$\nHere, $\\binom{n}{j}$ represents the number of ways to choose $j$ qubits out of $n$ to have an error, and the $3^j$ factor accounts for the three possible Pauli errors ($X, Y, Z$) on each of those $j$ qubits.\n\nConsider a family of non-degenerate stabilizer codes designed to protect a single logical qubit ($k=1$) against any single physical qubit error. Such a code must have a distance of at least $d=3$.

The number of physical qubits must be at least as large as the number of logical qubits, so $n \\ge k=1$. Also, for a distance $d=3$ code, $n$ must be at least 3, but we test from $n=1$ for completeness.\n\n- For $n=1$:\n$1 + 3(1) = 4$.
