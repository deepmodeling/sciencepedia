This first exercise introduces the core idea of graphical decoding, where syndromes from $X$ errors are visualized as defects on a grid that must be paired up. By applying a simple greedy algorithm, you will get a hands-on feel for how correction chains are constructed and how their \"weight\" corresponds to the path length on the lattice, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated matching algorithms [@problem_id:66247].", "problem": "The toric code is a quantum error-correcting code defined on a two-dimensional square lattice with periodic boundary conditions (a torus). Qubits are placed on the edges of the lattice. The code is stabilized by two types of operators: star operators $A_s = \\prod_{j \\in s} X_j$ for each vertex $s$, and plaquette operators $B_p = \\prod_{j \\in \\partial p} Z_j$ for each plaquette $p$.\n\nPauli $X$ errors on qubits can cause pairs of adjacent plaquette operators to yield an outcome of $-1$ when measured. These plaquettes with a $-1$ outcome are called Z-syndromes. The goal of decoding is to infer the X-error chain from the syndrome locations and apply a correction chain of X operators to restore the state to the codespace. The correction chain must pair up all the syndromes. The problem of finding the most likely error configuration is equivalent to finding a set of paths pairing the syndromes with minimum total length (weight).\n\nConsider a toric code on a sufficiently large $L \\times L$ lattice. An error event creates four Z-syndromes, located at plaquettes $p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$. The centers of these plaquettes can be described by integer coordinates $(x,y)$ on a dual lattice. The syndrome locations are given by $p_1=(0,0)$, $p_2=(W,0)$, $p_3=(0,H)$, and $p_4=(W,H)$, forming a rectangle. The distance between two syndromes is their Manhattan distance on the dual lattice, $d((x_i, y_i), (x_j, y_j)) = |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|$. This distance corresponds to the weight of the shortest X-operator chain connecting the two plaquettes.\n\nA simple decoding strategy is the greedy closest-pair algorithm. It works as follows:\n1.  Start with the set of all syndromes.\n2.  Find the pair of not-yet-matched syndromes with the minimum Manhattan distance.\n3.  Match this pair. The weight of the corresponding correction chain is this minimum distance.\n4.  Remove the matched pair from the set of syndromes to be considered.\n5.  Repeat steps 2-4 until all syndromes are paired.\n\nIn case of a tie for the closest pair, the pair $(p_i, p_j)$ with $ij$ that is lexicographically first is chosen. For example, if $(p_1, p_3)$ and $(p_2, p_4)$ are both closest pairs, $(p_1, p_3)$ is chosen because $(1,3)$ comes before $(2,4)$ lexicographically.\n\nGiven the syndrome rectangle dimensions $W$ and $H$, calculate the total weight of the correction determined by this greedy algorithm. For this problem, use $W=3$ and $H=1$.", "solution": "1. Syndrome coordinates: \n   $p_1=(0,0)$, $p_2=(W,0)$, $p_3=(0,H)$, $p_4=(W,H)$ with $W=3$, $H=1$.  \n2.

You will analyze the fate of a single $Y$ error, which simultaneously creates both $X$-type and $Z$-type syndromes. This exercise beautifully illustrates the CSS nature of the code, where independent decoders for bit-flips and phase-flips work in concert to perfectly correct the error, demonstrating a key principle of fault-tolerant design [@problem_id:66277].", "problem": "A surface code of distance $d=3$ is used to protect a single logical qubit. The code is defined on a two-dimensional square lattice where physical qubits reside on the edges. The stabilizers are of two types: $X$-type plaquette operators and $Z$-type vertex (or star) operators. Decoding is performed using independent Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoders for $X$ and $Z$ errors. The $X$-decoder acts on the syndrome provided by the $Z$-type stabilizers, and the $Z$-decoder acts on the syndrome from the $X$-type stabilizers.\n\nSuppose a single physical qubit in the bulk of the code, referred to as the \"central\" qubit, suffers a $Y$ error. A $Y$ error on a qubit $c$ is given by the Pauli operator $Y_c = iZ_c X_c$.\n\nAssuming the MWPM decoders find the unique minimum-weight error chain explaining the detected syndrome, calculate the probability that this single $Y_c$ error results in a logical error after the full correction procedure has been applied.", "solution": "The surface code has distance $d=3$ and protects one logical qubit. A $Y$ error on the central qubit $c$ is equivalent to $Y_c = i Z_c X_c$, which applies both a $Z$ error and an $X$ error on the same physical qubit.\n\n- The $Z$-type stabilizers (vertex operators) detect $X$ errors. An $X$ error on qubit $c$ anti-commutes with the two $Z$-type stabilizers adjacent to the edge corresponding to $c$, creating a syndrome with two vertex defects.\n- The $X$-type stabilizers (plaquette operators) detect $Z$ errors. A $Z$ error on qubit $c$ anti-commutes with the two $X$-type stabilizers adjacent to the edge, creating a syndrome with two plaquette defects.\n\nThe decoders operate independently:\n- The $X$-decoder uses the $Z$-syndrome (vertex defects) to correct $X$ errors.\n- The $Z$-decoder uses the $X$-syndrome (plaquette defects) to correct $Z$ errors.\n\nFor the $Z$-syndrome (two vertex defects), the minimum-weight error chain explaining the syndrome is a single edge (the central qubit $c$), with weight 1. Any other chain connecting the two defects would require at least three edges (e.g., a path around a plaquette), which has weight 3. Since the minimum weight is 1 and unique, the $X$-decoder always chooses to apply an $X$ correction on $c$.\n\nFor the $X$-syndrome (two plaquette defects), the minimum-weight error chain is also the central edge $c$, with weight 1. Any other chain would require at least three edges. The minimum weight is unique, so the $Z$-decoder always chooses to apply a $Z$ correction on $c$.\n\nThe correction operators are $X_c$ (from the $X$-decoder) and $Z_c$ (from the $Z$-decoder). The net correction operator is $X_c Z_c$. The error operator is $Y_c = i Z_c X_c$. The net operation after the error and correction is:\n\n$$\n(X_c Z_c) (i Z_c X_c) = i X_c Z_c Z_c X_c = i X_c (I) X_c = i X_c X_c = i I,\n$$\n\nwhere $I$ is the identity operator.

This practice delves into the critical concept of decoding failure, where the correction applied by an algorithm like Union-Find or MWPM, combined with the original error, results in an unintended logical operation. By determining the minimum weight of an error that can fool the decoder, you will gain a deeper understanding of what determines a code's true error-correcting capability and the origin of the logical error rate [@problem_id:66369].", "problem": "A distance $d=5$ planar surface code is defined on a $d \\times d$ square lattice where qubits reside on the vertices. The code is designed to protect against local errors. For this problem, we consider only single-qubit Pauli-X errors and their detection.\n\nThe stabilizers used to detect these X-errors are Z-plaquette operators, $B_p = \\prod_{q \\in p} Z_q$, where the product is over the four qubits at the corners of a plaquette $p$. An X-error on a qubit anticommutes with the four surrounding plaquette stabilizers (fewer if the qubit is on a boundary), thus flipping their eigenvalues from $+1$ to $-1$. These violated stabilizers are called syndromes.\n\nA decoder's task is to infer the most likely error configuration from the syndrome information. The Union-Find decoder is an efficient algorithm that, for the error model considered, functions as a Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder. It finds a correction operator $C$, which is a set of X-errors, that explains the given syndrome and has the minimum possible number of errors (i.e., minimal weight).\n\nA logical failure occurs if the decoder's correction $C$ is different from the true physical error $E$, and the combined operation $E \\cdot C^{-1} = E \\cdot C$ (since $X_q^2=I$) results in a net logical operator being applied to the encoded state. This happens if there exists an error chain $C$ with $w(C)  w(E)$ that produces the same syndrome as $E$, and $E \\cdot C$ is equivalent to a logical operator $L_X$. Note that any logical operator $L_X$ is by definition syndrome-free in the bulk of the code.\n\nFor a distance $d=5$ surface code, the minimal-weight logical X-operator, $L_X$, is a string of $X$ operators on all $d=5$ qubits along a row of the lattice.\n\nFind the minimum weight of a physical error configuration $E$ that causes a logical failure in such a system.", "solution": "We denote by $S$ the support of the minimal logical operator $L_X$ (a row of $d=5$ qubits), and by $T$ the support of any candidate correction $C$.
