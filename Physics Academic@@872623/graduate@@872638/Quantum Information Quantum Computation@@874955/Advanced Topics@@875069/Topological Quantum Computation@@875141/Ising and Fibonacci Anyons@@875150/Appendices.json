This model consists of two types of particles (topological charges): the vacuum or identity particle, denoted by $\\mathbb{I}$, and a non-abelian anyon, denoted by $\\tau$. When two anyons are brought together, their combined topological charge is determined by a set of fusion rules.

Braiding adjacent anyons is straightforward, but manipulating information often requires performing operations on non-adjacent particles.
