By working with a small, tractable model analogous to a planar code, you will practice the two most fundamental steps: calculating the error syndrome resulting from a specific Pauli error, and then determining the minimum-weight correction required to restore the state. This hands-on calculation solidifies the core principles of how stabilizer codes detect and correct errors [@problem_id:109980].", "problem": "Consider a small quantum error-correcting code designed with a structure analogous to a planar code. The code utilizes nine data qubits arranged in a $3 \\times 3$ grid, labeled as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{matrix}\nq_1 & - & q_2 & - & q_3 \\\\\n|   &   & |   &   & |   \\\\\nq_4 & - & q_5 & - & q_6 \\\\\n|   &   & |   &   & |   \\\\\nq_7 & - & q_8 & - & q_9\n\\end{matrix}\n$$\nThe code is defined by the following four stabilizer generators, which are products of Pauli operators:\n- $P_{Z1} = Z_1 Z_2 Z_4 Z_5$\n- $P_{X1} = X_2 X_3 X_5 X_6$\n- $P_{X2} = X_4 X_5 X_7 X_8$\n- $P_{Z2} = Z_5 Z_6 Z_8 Z_9$\n\nInitially, the system is prepared in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ within the code space, such that for every stabilizer $S_k$ in the set $\\{P_{Z1}, P_{X1}, P_{X2}, P_{Z2}\\}$, $S_k |\\psi\\rangle = +1 |\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nSuppose the system suffers a single-qubit error on the central qubit, $q_5$, described by the Pauli operator $E = Y_5$. A syndrome measurement is then performed, yielding an eigenvalue of $+1$ or $-1$ for each stabilizer generator.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum-weight Pauli operator, $C$, that would be applied to correct this error. The correction is considered successful if the operator product $C E$ returns the state to the code space (i.e., $CE$ is an element of the stabilizer group $\\mathcal{S}$, which consists of all possible products of the generators). The correction operator $C$ should be specified as a product of Pauli matrices on specific qubits (e.g., $X_i Z_j$). Ignore any overall phase factors.", "solution": "The solution involves two main steps: first, calculating the error syndrome, and second, finding the minimum-weight Pauli operator that produces this syndrome.\n\n**Step 1: Syndrome Calculation**\n\nThe syndrome is determined by checking whether the error operator $E$ commutes or anti-commutes with each stabilizer generator $S_k$. If $[E, S_k] = 0$, the measurement outcome for $S_k$ is $+1$. If $\\{E, S_k\\} = ES_k + S_kE = 0$, the outcome is $-1$. Two Pauli strings commute if they anti-commute on an even number of shared qubits, and they anti-commute if they anti-commute on an odd number of shared qubits.\n\nThe error is $E = Y_5 = iX_5Z_5$. We examine its relation with each of the four stabilizers.\n\n1.  **Commutation with $P_{Z1} = Z_1 Z_2 Z_4 Z_5$**:\n    The operators $P_{Z1}$ and $E$ have support on overlapping qubit sets, with the only common qubit being $q_5$. We only need to check the commutation relation for the operators on this qubit: $Z_5$ and $Y_5$.\n    The Pauli operators $Y$ and $Z$ on the same qubit anti-commute: $\\{Y, Z\\} = YZ + ZY = (iXZ)Z + Z(iXZ) = iX(Z^2) + iZXZ = iX - i(XZ)Z = iX - i(-X) = 2iX \\neq 0$. More directly, $\\{Y_5, Z_5\\}=0$.\n    Since they anti-commute on one qubit (an odd number), the full operators $E$ and $P_{Z1}$ anti-commute.\n    Syndrome for $P_{Z1}$ is $-1$.\n\n2.  **Commutation with $P_{X1} = X_2 X_3 X_5 X_6$**:\n    The only common qubit between $P_{X1}$ and $E=Y_5$ is $q_5$. The relevant operators are $X_5$ and $Y_5$.\n    The Pauli operators $X$ and $Y$ on the same qubit anti-commute: $\\{X, Y\\} = XY+YX = X(iXZ) + (iXZ)X = iX^2Z + iXZX = iZ -iX(XZ) = iZ-i(-Z) = 2iZ \\neq 0$. More directly, $\\{X_5, Y_5\\}=0$.\n    Since they anti-commute on one qubit, $E$ and $P_{X1}$ anti-commute.\n    Syndrome for $P_{X1}$ is $-1$.\n\n3.  **Commutation with $P_{X2} = X_4 X_5 X_7 X_8$**:\n    The only common qubit is $q_5$. The operators are $X_5$ and $Y_5$. As established above, they anti-commute.\n    Therefore, $E$ and $P_{X2}$ anti-commute.\n    Syndrome for $P_{X2}$ is $-1$.\n\n4.  **Commutation with $P_{Z2} = Z_5 Z_6 Z_8 Z_9$**:\n    The only common qubit is $q_5$. The operators are $Z_5$ and $Y_5$. As established above, they anti-commute.\n    Therefore, $E$ and $P_{Z2}$ anti-commute.\n    Syndrome for $P_{Z2}$ is $-1$.\n\nThe full error syndrome is $(-1, -1, -1, -1)$, meaning all four stabilizer measurements yield a $-1$ outcome.\n\n**Step 2: Minimum-Weight Correction**\n\nThe decoding procedure aims to find the simplest (minimum-weight) Pauli operator $C$ that produces the same syndrome as the error $E$. This means $C$ must also anti-commute with all four stabilizer generators.\n\nLet the correction operator be $C$.\n- $C$ must anti-commute with $P_{Z1}$ and $P_{Z2}$. This implies $C$ must have a component ($X$ or $Y$) that anti-commutes with the $Z$ operators in the stabilizers.\n- $C$ must anti-commute with $P_{X1}$ and $P_{X2}$. This implies $C$ must have a component ($Z$ or $Y$) that anti-commutes with the $X$ operators in the stabilizers.\n\nLet's test possible correction operators, starting with weight-1 operators.\nA weight-1 operator acts non-trivially on only a single qubit $q_k$. For such an operator to anti-commute with a stabilizer $S$, it must act on a qubit in the support of $S$ and the local Pauli operators must anti-commute.\n\nFrom the stabilizer definitions, we see that $q_5$ is the only qubit that is part of the support of all four stabilizer generators.\n- $P_{Z1} = Z_1 Z_2 Z_4 Z_5$\n- $P_{X1} = X_2 X_3 X_5 X_6$\n- $P_{X2} = X_4 X_5 X_7 X_8$\n- $P_{Z2} = Z_5 Z_6 Z_8 Z_9$\n\nAny correction operator that does not act on $q_5$ cannot anti-commute with all four stabilizers simultaneously. For example, an operator on $q_1$ could only anti-commute with $P_{Z1}$ (if it's $X_1$ or $Y_1$), but would commute with the other three.\n\nTherefore, the minimum-weight correction operator must be a Pauli operator acting on $q_5$. Let this operator be $C = P_5$, where $P \\in \\{X, Y, Z\\}$.\nWe test each possibility:\n- If $C = X_5$: It anti-commutes with $P_{Z1}$ and $P_{Z2}$ (since $\\{X_5, Z_5\\}=0$). It commutes with $P_{X1}$ and $P_{X2}$ (since $[X_5, X_5]=0$). This does not match the syndrome.\n- If $C = Z_5$: It commutes with $P_{Z1}$ and $P_{Z2}$ (since $[Z_5, Z_5]=0$). It anti-commutes with $P_{X1}$ and $P_{X2}$ (since $\\{Z_5, X_5\\}=0$). This does not match the syndrome.\n- If $C = Y_5$: It anti-commutes with $P_{Z1}$ and $P_{Z2}$ (since $\\{Y_5, Z_5\\}=0$). It also anti-commutes with $P_{X1}$ and $P_{X2}$ (since $\\{Y_5, X_5\\}=0$). This perfectly matches the calculated syndrome.\n\nThe minimum-weight operator that produces the syndrome $(-1,-1,-1,-1)$ is $C=Y_5$. This is a weight-1 operator. Any other operator producing the same syndrome would have to be $Y_5$ multiplied by an element of the stabilizer group, which would result in a higher weight.\n\nThe correction operator is $C = Y_5$. Applying this correction to the errored state gives the total operator $CE = Y_5 Y_5 = I$. This returns the state to the original codeword, successfully correcting the error.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{Y_5}\n$$", "id": "109980"}, {"introduction": "Effective error correction relies on a decoder algorithm to interpret syndrome data and infer the most probable error. This problem explores the logic of a minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, a cornerstone algorithm for surface codes. You will analyze how the decoder's optimal correction strategy changes as new syndrome information becomes available, specifically by comparing the cost of pairing syndromes to each other versus pairing them to a boundary [@problem_id:110069]. This exercise highlights the dynamic and geometric nature of the decoding process.", "problem": "A planar code is constructed on a 2D square lattice of data qubits occupying the semi-infinite region defined by integer coordinates $(m,n)$ for vertices, with $m \\ge 0$. The faces of the lattice are called plaquettes. Associated with each plaquette $p$ is a Z-stabilizer operator $S_p = \\prod_{q \\in \\partial p} Z_q$, where the product is over the Pauli-Z operators of the data qubits $q$ on the boundary of $p$. A bit-flip error (Pauli-X) on a data qubit will cause the two plaquettes adjacent to it to have their stabilizer measurement outcome flipped to $-1$; these plaquettes are said to exhibit a Z-syndrome.\n\nThe lattice has a *smooth boundary* at $x=0$. At such a boundary, an error chain consisting of X-operators can terminate without creating a syndrome. From a decoding perspective, the boundary acts as a single entity to which syndromes can be matched. The plaquettes can be labeled by integer coordinates $(i,j)$, where $i \\ge 0$ is the column index starting from the one adjacent to the boundary, and $j$ is the row index.\n\nThe recovery from errors is guided by a minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm. This algorithm models the syndromes as nodes in a graph and finds a set of paths (error chains) that pair them up with minimum total length. For a planar code with a boundary, the boundary itself is treated as a node that syndromes can be paired with. The length of an error chain, or the distance between its endpoints (syndromes, or a syndrome and the boundary), is given by the Manhattan distance. The distance between two plaquettes $p_1=(i_1, j_1)$ and $p_2=(i_2, j_2)$ is $d(p_1, p_2) = |i_1 - i_2| + |j_1 - j_2|$. The distance from a plaquette $p=(i,j)$ to the smooth boundary $B$ is $d(p, B) = i + 1$. The total length of the correction path is the sum of the lengths of all paths in the minimum-weight matching.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n1.  **Initial State:** A single Z-syndrome is detected at a plaquette $p_1$, which is located adjacent to the smooth boundary (i.e., its column index is $i_1=0$).\n2.  **Final State:** An additional error occurs, resulting in a state with two Z-syndromes. The original syndrome at $p_1$ persists, and a new syndrome appears at a plaquette $p_2$. This second plaquette $p_2$ is located in the bulk (column index $i_2 > 0$) and is at a Manhattan distance of $D$ from $p_1$.\n\nFor the specific case where the distance is $D=2$, calculate the change in the total length of the minimum-weight correction path, $\\Delta L = L_{final} - L_{initial}$. Here, $L_{initial}$ is the correction path length for the initial state with one syndrome, and $L_{final}$ is for the final state with two syndromes.", "solution": "The planar code has a smooth boundary at $x=0$. The initial state has one Z-syndrome at plaquette $p_1$ with coordinates $(0, j_1)$. The distance from $p_1$ to the boundary $B$ is given by $d(p_1, B) = i_1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$. For a single syndrome, the minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm pairs it with the boundary, so the initial correction path length is $L_{\\text{initial}} = d(p_1, B) = 1$.\n\nAfter an additional error, there are two Z-syndromes: $p_1$ at $(0, j_1)$ and $p_2$ at $(i_2, j_2)$ with $i_2 > 0$. The Manhattan distance between $p_1$ and $p_2$ is $D = |i_1 - i_2| + |j_1 - j_2| = |0 - i_2| + |j_1 - j_2| = i_2 + |j_1 - j_2| = 2$. The distance from $p_2$ to the boundary is $d(p_2, B) = i_2 + 1$.\n\nFor the final state with two syndromes, there are two possible pairings:\n1. Pair $p_1$ with the boundary and $p_2$ with the boundary. The total path length is $d(p_1, B) + d(p_2, B) = 1 + (i_2 + 1) = i_2 + 2$.\n2. Pair $p_1$ with $p_2$. The distance is $d(p_1, p_2) = 2$.\n\nSince $i_2 > 0$ and $i_2 + |j_1 - j_2| = 2$, the possible integer solutions are $(i_2, |j_1 - j_2|) = (1, 1)$ or $(2, 0)$.

This practice is crucial for understanding the bridge between physical error models and the logical error framework that decoders operate on.", "problem": "In the planar surface code, information is encoded in a 2D lattice of qubits. The logical state is protected by measuring stabilizer operators, which are products of Pauli operators acting on specific groups of data qubits. There are two types of stabilizers: $X$-type plaquette operators and $Z$-type vertex operators.\n\nConsider a $Z$-type stabilizer (a \"star\" or \"vertex\" operator) for a vertex $v$ involving four data qubits, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The stabilizer operator is given by $S_v = Z_1 \\otimes Z_2 \\otimes Z_3 \\otimes Z_4$, where $Z_i$ is the Pauli-Z operator on qubit $i$.\n\nThe measurement of $S_v$ is typically performed using an ancillary qubit, labeled 'a'. A standard circuit to measure $S_v$ involves a sequence of controlled-Z (CZ) gates, where each data qubit acts as a control on the ancilla. The total entangling unitary applied between the data qubits and the ancilla is $U_{\\text{CZ}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{4} CZ_{i,a}$, where $CZ_{i,a}$ is the CZ gate between data qubit $i$ and ancilla $a$.\n\nNow, suppose a leakage error occurs. Just before the sequence of CZ gates is applied, data qubit 1 leaks from the computational subspace $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$ to a third, non-computational energy level, which we denote as $|2\\rangle$. Assume that a CZ gate involving a qubit in the $|2\\rangle$ state fails to apply any transformation; that is, it acts as the identity operator. Due to this fault, the entangling unitary that is actually applied is $U'_{\\text{CZ}} = \\prod_{i=2}^{4} CZ_{i,a}$.\n\nThis measurement fault is equivalent to an effective Pauli error operator acting on the data qubits. In the context of fault-tolerant quantum computation, this effective error is the operator $E$ that must be applied to the data qubits in a perfect measurement cycle to reproduce the same syndrome that the faulty measurement cycle would produce.\n\nCalculate this effective Pauli error operator, $E$, which is induced on the data qubits by the described leakage fault.", "solution": "The problem asks for the effective Pauli error `E` on the data qubits that is equivalent to the described measurement fault.

The circuit effectively measures the operator `S'_v = Z_2 Z_3 Z_4`.\n\n2.  **Finding the Effective Error:**\n    We are looking for a Pauli error `E` such that the outcome of measuring `S_v` on an errored state `E|\\psi⟩` is the same as the outcome of measuring `S'_v` on the original state `|ψ⟩`. The outcome of measuring an operator `O` on a state `|ϕ⟩` is determined by the action of `O` on `|ϕ⟩`.\n    *   Outcome of faulty measurement of `S_v` on `|ψ⟩` is determined by the operator `S'_v`.\n    *   Outcome of perfect measurement of `S_v` on `E|ψ⟩` is determined by the operator `S_v E`.\n\n    For these two scenarios to be equivalent for any state `|ψ⟩`, the operators describing the outcome must be proportional:\n    $$ S_v E \\propto S'_v $$\n    We have `S_v = Z_1 S'_v`. Substituting this into the relation gives:\n    $$ (Z_1 S'_v) E \\propto S'_v $$\n    This proportionality holds if `Z_1 E` is proportional to the identity operator, `I`.

The leakage fault on qubit 1, which causes the `CZ_{1,a}` gate to fail, is therefore equivalent to a Pauli `Z` error occurring on data qubit 1.
