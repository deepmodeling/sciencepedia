Let's analyze the commutation constraints for pure $X$-type and pure $Z$-type logical operators.\n\n2.  Consider a pure $Z$-type logical operator, $L_Z = \\prod_{(i,j) \\in S} Z_{i,j}$. For $L_Z$ to commute with all row-like generators $A_{i,j} = X_{i,j}X_{i,j+1}$, the support $S$ of $L_Z$ must intersect the support of each $A_{i,j}$ an even number of times. This means that for any given row $i$, either all qubits in that row are in the support $S$, or none are. Therefore, the lowest-weight non-trivial $Z$-type logical operator is a product of $Z$ operators along a full row, for example, $\\bar{Z}_L = \\prod_{j=1}^L Z_{1,j}$. This operator has weight $L$. It can be verified that it commutes with all column-like $Z$ generators as well.\n\n3.  Similarly, consider a pure $X$-type logical operator, $L_X = \\prod_{(i,j) \\in S'} X_{i,j}$.

The measurement outcomes determine a new, conventional stabilizer code. Consider a Bacon-Shor code on a $3 \\times 4$ grid of qubits ($m=3, n=4$). Suppose we fix the gauge by measuring all of the $X$-type gauge generators $\\{G^X_{i,j}\\}$ and find all measurement outcomes to be $+1$.

Since all operators in $\\mathcal{S}_{fixed}$ are purely $X$-type, they commute with $\\bar{Z}_L$. Therefore, the weight of $L_Z$ is the sum of the weights of $S$ and $\\bar{Z}_L$ (since they have disjoint support in the $\\{X,Z\\}$ basis). Multiplication by a non-identity stabilizer will only increase the weight. Thus, the minimum weight for a logical $Z$ operator is 4.\n\n5. Consider a logical $X$ operator, such as $\\bar{X}_{L} = X_{1,1}X_{2,1}X_{3,1}$. Its weight is 3. An equivalent logical operator is $L_X = S \\cdot \\bar{X}_L$ where $S \\in \\mathcal{S}_{fixed}$. The operators in $\\mathcal{S}_{fixed}$ are products of horizontal pairs of $X$ operators. Multiplying $\\bar{X}_L$ by such an operator can move the locations of the $X$ operators within their respective rows, but it cannot cancel any of them out, as the operators in $\\bar{X}_L$ are in different rows. The number of non-identity $X$ operators in each row will remain odd (specifically, one). Therefore, the weight of any equivalent logical $X$ operator must be at least 3 (one $X$ per row).
