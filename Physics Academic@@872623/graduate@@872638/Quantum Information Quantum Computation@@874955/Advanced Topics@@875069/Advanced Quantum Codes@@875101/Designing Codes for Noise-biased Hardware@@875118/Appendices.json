Consider a quantum system where the noise is dominated by dephasing, which can be modeled as each qubit independently experiencing a Pauli-Z error with probability $p \\ll 1$. We wish to compare the performance of two different encoding schemes under this noise model.\n\nCode A is the standard [[9,1,3]] Shor code. Its construction can be viewed as a concatenated code. An outer 3-qubit phase-flip code encodes the logical information. Each of the three qubits of this outer code is then encoded using an inner 3-qubit bit-flip code. The encoding for the bit-flip code is $|0\\rangle \\to |000\\rangle, |1\\rangle \\to |111\\rangle$. The encoding for the phase-flip code is $|0\\rangle \\to (|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)^{\\otimes 3}/\\sqrt{8}$, $|1\\rangle \\to (|0\\rangle-|1\\rangle)^{\\otimes 3}/\\sqrt{8}$.\n\nCode B is a 27-qubit code constructed by applying three levels of concatenation using only the 3-qubit phase-flip code. That is, a single logical qubit is encoded using the phase-flip code. Each of the resulting three qubits is then encoded again using the same phase-flip code, and this process is repeated a third time, yielding a [[27,1,$d$]] code.\n\nAssuming the physical error probability $p$ is small, the logical error probability $P_L$ for a code that corrects up to $t$ errors behaves as $P_L \\approx C p^{t+1}$ for some constant $C$.

This exercise explores the inner workings of a decoder that assumes all errors are Z-type, even when faced with a syndrome caused by an X-type error. By mapping the problem onto a graph and calculating the path a biased decoder would find, you will see firsthand how a decoder's assumptions can lead it to misinterpret the physical error, a critical concept in decoder design [@problem_id:68341].", "problem": "A new generation of quantum hardware exhibits highly biased noise, where Pauli-Z errors are far more likely than Pauli-X or Y errors. Quantum error-correcting codes like the XZZX surface code are designed to leverage this property. In such codes, the task of decoding can be mapped to finding minimum weight paths on a graph whose vertices are the stabilizer checks and whose edges represent physical qubit errors.\n\nFor an XZZX-type code, the syndrome graph for Z-errors is different from the syndrome graph for X-errors. A decoder designed for infinitely Z-biased noise (a Z-biased decoder) will operate solely on the Z-error syndrome graph, assuming any measured syndrome must be due to Z-errors.\n\nConsider a distance-3 planar XZZX-type code with a set of 9 stabilizer checks, which we can label by integer coordinates $(i,j)$ for $i,j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Let's denote a stabilizer check by $S_{ij}$.\n- The **Z-error syndrome graph**, $G_Z$, has these 9 stabilizers as vertices. An edge exists between any two vertices $S_{ij}$ and $S_{i'j'}$ if they are adjacent on the $3 \\times 3$ grid (i.e., if $|i-i'| + |j-j'| = 1$). An edge in $G_Z$ between two stabilizers corresponds to a single data qubit, on which a Z-error would flip precisely those two stabilizers.\n- The **X-error syndrome graph**, $G_X$, has the same 9 stabilizers as vertices. Its edges are defined differently. There is an edge between the central stabilizer $S_{22}$ and each of its grid neighbors, i.e., vertices $(S_{22}, S_{12})$, $(S_{22}, S_{21})$, $(S_{22}, S_{23})$, and $(S_{22}, S_{32})$. An edge in $G_X$ corresponds to a single data qubit, on which an X-error would flip the two connected stabilizers.\n\nSuppose a two-qubit error $E = X_a X_b$ occurs. The error acts on two data qubits, $a$ and $b$, that are \"adjacent\" in the sense that their corresponding edges in the $G_X$ graph share a vertex. Specifically, qubit $a$ corresponds to the edge between $S_{12}$ and $S_{22}$ in $G_X$, and qubit $b$ corresponds to the edge between $S_{21}$ and $S_{22}$ in $G_X$.\n\nThis error $E$ creates a syndrome which is measured perfectly. A Z-biased decoder receives this syndrome and attempts to find a corrective action. The decoder finds the most likely cause of the syndrome by assuming it was generated by a chain of single-qubit Z-errors. This corresponds to finding a minimum-length path in the $G_Z$ graph that connects the stabilizers flipped by the error. The weight of the correction is the number of Z-errors in this minimal chain.\n\nCalculate the weight of this minimal Z-error correction chain.", "solution": "The problem asks for the weight of the minimal Z-error correction proposed by a Z-biased decoder in response to a specific two-qubit X-error.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial error and its syndrome.**\n    The error is $E = X_a X_b$.\n    Qubit $a$ corresponds to the edge $(S_{12}, S_{22})$ in the X-error syndrome graph $G_X$.

A single-qubit error $X_b$ would flip the stabilizers $S_{21}$ and $S_{22}$.\n\n    The total syndrome from the error $E = X_a X_b$ is the set of stabilizers that are flipped an odd number of times.\n    - $S_{12}$ is flipped once (by $X_a$).\n    - $S_{21}$ is flipped once (by $X_b$).\n    - $S_{22}$ is flipped twice (once by $X_a$ and once by $X_b$).\n    - All other stabilizers are not flipped.\n\n    A double flip of a stabilizer returns it to its original state. Therefore, the net syndrome, i.e., the set of stabilizers that report a non-trivial measurement outcome, is $\\{S_{12}, S_{21}\\}$. These are the \"syndrome defects\".\n\n2.  **Determine the Z-biased decoder's task.**\n    The Z-biased decoder sees the syndrome defects at locations $S_{12}$ and $S_{21}$. The decoder's algorithm is to find a minimum-weight chain of Z-errors that could produce this syndrome. In the graph-based picture, this is equivalent to finding a shortest path between the syndrome vertices $S_{12}$ and $S_{21}$ in the Z-error syndrome graph $G_Z$. The weight of the correction is the length of this shortest path (number of edges).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Z-error syndrome graph $G_Z$.**\n    The graph $G_Z$ has 9 vertices, corresponding to the stabilizers $S_{ij}$ for $i,j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The vertices are arranged in a $3 \\times 3$ grid. Edges connect adjacent vertices. The length of a path in this graph is the number of edges. The shortest path length between two vertices $S_{ij}$ and $S_{i'j'}$ is given by the Manhattan distance:\n    $$\n    d((i,j), (i',j')) = |i - i'| + |j - j'|.\n    $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the shortest path length.**\n    The decoder needs to find the shortest path between the syndrome defects $S_{12}$ and $S_{21}$. We use the Manhattan distance formula for the coordinates of the stabilizers, which are $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$.\n    $$\n    \\text{Path length} = d((1,2), (2,1)) = |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    $$\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    The shortest path in $G_Z$ between $S_{12}$ and $S_{21}$ has a length of 2. This means the decoder postulates a two-qubit Z-error (a Z-error chain of weight 2) as the cause of the syndrome. For example, a Z-error on the qubit linking $S_{12}$ and $S_{22}$, followed by a Z-error on the qubit linking $S_{22}$ and $S_{21}$, would form a path of length 2 and explain the syndrome.

This problem investigates the crucial issue of syndrome degeneracy, where multiple different physical errors can produce the exact same syndrome. You will analyze a scenario in a code inspired by the heavy-hexagon architecture, where the decoder is forced to guess the true error, and calculate the probability that this guess leads to an uncorrectable logical error [@problem_id:68322].", "problem": "Consider a toy model for a quantum error-correcting code defined on a set of $N=9$ data qubits, labeled $Q_1, Q_2, \\ldots, Q_9$. This code is designed to correct against Pauli-X errors by measuring a set of four $Z$-type plaquette operators (stabilizers). The stabilizers are given by:\n$$S_1 = Z_1 Z_2 Z_3 Z_4 Z_5$$\n$$S_2 = Z_1 Z_2 Z_3 Z_5 Z_6$$\n$$S_3 = Z_4 Z_5 Z_7 Z_8$$\n$$S_4 = Z_5 Z_6 Z_8 Z_9$$\nwhere $Z_i$ is the Pauli-Z operator on qubit $Q_i$.\n\nAn operator is defined as a logical operator if it commutes with all stabilizers ($[L, S_k] = 0$ for all $k$) but is not itself an element of the stabilizer group (i.e., it cannot be written as a product of the stabilizer generators $S_k$).\n\nA single physical X-type error occurs on one of the nine data qubits, with each qubit being equally likely to be affected. The location of the error is unknown, and a simple error correction procedure is performed. The procedure consists of two steps:\n1.  **Syndrome Measurement:** The eigenvalues of all four stabilizers $S_k$ are measured to determine the error syndrome. An error $E$ creates a syndrome which is the set of stabilizers that anti-commute with $E$.\n2.  **Decoding and Correction:** A simple decoder analyzes the syndrome. It identifies the set of all possible Pauli-X error operators of the *minimum possible weight* that could have caused the observed syndrome. From this set of minimum-weight candidates, the decoder chooses one uniformly at random and applies it as the correction operator, $C$.\n\nA misidentification occurs if the composition of the correction and the original error, $C \\cdot E$, results in a non-trivial logical operator.\n\nCalculate the total probability that such a misidentification occurs, averaged over all possible initial single-qubit X-errors.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability of a misidentification by a specific decoder for a given code and noise model. Let's break down the solution into steps.\n\n**1. Analyze the Code and Noise Model**\nThe code has $N=9$ data qubits and $m=4$ Z-stabilizers.\nThe noise model is a single Pauli-X error $E_i = X_i$ on qubit $Q_i$. Since each qubit is equally likely to be affected, the probability of a specific error $E_i$ is $P(E_i) = 1/N = 1/9$ for any $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 9\\}$.\n\n**2. Understand the Decoder and Misidentification Mechanism**\nThe decoder's action depends on the error syndrome. The syndrome of an error $E_i = X_i$ is the set of stabilizers $\\{S_k\\}$ that anti-commute with $X_i$. This corresponds to the set of stabilizers whose support includes qubit $Q_i$.\n\nA misidentification occurs if $C \\cdot E_i = L$, where $L$ is a non-trivial logical operator. The decoder chooses $C$ from the set of minimum-weight explanations for the syndrome of $E_i$. A logical error happens if the decoder chooses a correction $C \\neq E_i$. This is possible only if there are multiple minimum-weight operators that produce the same syndrome as $E_i$.\n\nLet's find the syndrome for a single-qubit error $X_i$. The syndrome is determined by which stabilizers $S_k$ contain $Z_i$. We can list the set of stabilizers each qubit belongs to:\n- $Q_1$: in $S_1, S_2$. Syndrome: $\\{S_1, S_2\\}$.\n- $Q_2$: in $S_1, S_2$. Syndrome: $\\{S_1, S_2\\}$.\n- $Q_3$: in $S_1, S_2$. Syndrome: $\\{S_1, S_2\\}$.\n- $Q_4$: in $S_1, S_3$. Syndrome: $\\{S_1, S_3\\}$.\n- $Q_5$: in $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$. Syndrome: $\\{S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4\\}$.\n- $Q_6$: in $S_2, S_4$. Syndrome: $\\{S_2, S_4\\}$.\n- $Q_7$: in $S_3$. Syndrome: $\\{S_3\\}$.\n- $Q_8$: in $S_3, S_4$. Syndrome: $\\{S_3, S_4\\}$.\n- $Q_9$: in $S_4$. Syndrome: $\\{S_4\\}$.\n\n**3. Identify Degenerate Qubits**\nThe decoder can be confused if different single-qubit errors produce the same syndrome. By inspecting the list above, we can identify sets of qubits that are \"degenerate\" in this sense.\n- The set $\\{Q_1, Q_2, Q_3\\}$ is a degenerate set. An X-error on any of these three qubits produces the syndrome $\\{S_1, S_2\\}$.\n- All other qubits ($Q_4, Q_5, Q_6, Q_7, Q_8, Q_9$) have unique syndromes.\n\n**4. Analyze Misidentification Probability for Each Case**\n\n**Case 1: Error on a non-degenerate qubit ($i \\in \\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$)**\nLet's consider an error on any of these 6 qubits, for example $E_7 = X_7$. The syndrome is $\\{S_3\\}$. The decoder looks for minimum-weight explanations. $X_7$ is a weight-1 explanation. Since no other single qubit produces this syndrome, any other explanation must have a weight of 2 or more. Therefore, $X_7$ is the unique minimum-weight explanation.\nThe decoder deterministically chooses $C=X_7$. The resulting operator is $C \\cdot E_7 = X_7 \\cdot X_7 = I$. This is the identity, not a logical error.\nThe same logic applies to qubits 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.\nThus, for $i \\in \\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$, the probability of misidentification is 0.\n\n**Case 2: Error on a degenerate qubit ($i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$)**\nLet the error be $E_1 = X_1$. The syndrome is $\\{S_1, S_2\\}$.\nThe decoder seeks minimum-weight explanations. The errors $X_1, X_2, X_3$ all produce this syndrome and have weight 1. Any other explanation would have weight $\\ge 2$.\nThe set of minimum-weight explanations is $\\{X_1, X_2, X_3\\}$.\nThe decoder chooses its correction $C$ uniformly at random from this set. So, $P(C=X_1) = P(C=X_2) = P(C=X_3) = 1/3$.\n\nA misidentification occurs if $C \\cdot E_1$ is a logical operator.\n- If $C=X_1$, the residual error is $X_1 \\cdot X_1 = I$. No logical error.\n- If $C=X_2$, the residual error is $X_2 \\cdot X_1$. We need to check if this is a logical operator. An operator $L$ is logical if it commutes with all stabilizers and is not a stabilizer itself.\n  Let's check $L=X_1 X_2$. Both $X_1$ and $X_2$ anti-commute with $S_1$ and $S_2$, and commute with $S_3$ and $S_4$. Therefore, their product $X_1 X_2$ will commute with all stabilizers. Since $X_1 X_2$ is a product of Pauli-X operators, it cannot be a product of the Z-type stabilizers. Thus, $X_1 X_2$ is a logical operator. This outcome is a misidentification.\n- If $C=X_3$, the residual error is $X_3 \\cdot X_1$. By the same reasoning, $X_1 X_3$ is a logical operator. This is also a misidentification.\n\nSo, for an initial error $E_1=X_1$, a misidentification occurs with probability $P(\\text{misidentify}|E_1) = P(C=X_2) + P(C=X_3) = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3$.\n\nBy symmetry, the same argument holds if the initial error is $E_2=X_2$ or $E_3=X_3$.\n- If $E_2=X_2$, misidentification occurs if $C=X_1$ or $C=X_3$. Prob = $2/3$.\n- If $E_3=X_3$, misidentification occurs if $C=X_1$ or $C=X_2$. Prob = $2/3$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Probability**\nThe total probability of misidentification is the sum of probabilities over all possible initial errors, weighted by the probability of each error.\n$$P(\\text{misidentify}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{9} P(\\text{misidentify}|E_i) P(E_i)$$\nWe have two groups of initial errors:\n- For $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, $P(\\text{misidentify}|E_i) = 2/3$. There are 3 such qubits.\n- For $i \\in \\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$, $P(\\text{misidentify}|E_i) = 0$. There are 6 such qubits.\nThe probability of any specific error $E_i$ is $P(E_i) = 1/9$.\n\n$$P(\\text{misidentify}) = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{9} \\right) \\times 3 + \\left( 0 \\times \\frac{1}{9} \\right) \\times 6$$\n$$P(\\text{misidentify}) = \\left( \\frac{2}{27} \\right) \\times 3 + 0$$\n$$P(\\text{misidentify}) = \\frac{6}{27} = \\frac{2}{9}$$\nThe total probability of a misidentification is $2/9$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{2}{9}} $$", "id": "68322"}]}
