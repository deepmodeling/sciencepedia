The measurement operators corresponding to the outcomes `+` and `-` are the projectors onto the Hadamard basis states:\n$$M_+ = |+\\rangle\\langle+| = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$M_- = |-\\rangle\\langle-| = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThese form a valid POVM since $M_+ + M_- = I$.\n\nThe channel's action on an arbitrary input density matrix $\\rho$ is given by:\n$$\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}(M_+ \\rho) \\sigma_0 + \\mathrm{Tr}(M_- \\rho) \\sigma_1$$\nwhere $\\sigma_0 = |0\\rangle\\langle0|$ and $\\sigma_1 = |1\\rangle\\langle1|$.

Due to the concavity of the von Neumann entropy, the maximum is always achieved for an ensemble of pure states. Let's consider a general pure input state $|\\psi\\rangle$, represented by a density matrix $\\rho = |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|$.\n\nLet the input state be represented in the Bloch sphere by the vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, so $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})$. A general density matrix is $\\rho = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ b^* & 1-a \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe probabilities of the measurement outcomes are:\n$$p_+(\\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}(M_+ \\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\rho\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}( \\rho_{00} + \\rho_{01} + \\rho_{10} + \\rho_{11} ) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + 2\\mathrm{Re}(\\rho_{01}))$$\n$$p_-(\\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}(M_- \\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\rho\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}( \\rho_{00} - \\rho_{01} - \\rho_{10} + \\rho_{11} ) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 2\\mathrm{Re}(\\rho_{01}))$$\nThe output state is then:\n$$\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = p_+(\\rho) |0\\rangle\\langle0| + p_-(\\rho) |1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} p_+(\\rho) & 0 \\\\ 0 & p_-(\\rho) \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe output state is always diagonal in the computational basis.

The entropy $S(\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_i))$ is zero if the output state is pure, which occurs if $p_+(\\rho_i)$ is either 0 or 1.\n- $p_+(\\rho) = 1 \\implies \\mathrm{Re}(\\rho_{01}) = 1/2$.

The binary entropy is maximized when the probabilities are equal, i.e., $p_1 = p_2 = 1/2$. For this choice:\n$$\\max_{p_1} H(p_1) = H(1/2) = - (1/2)\\log_2(1/2) - (1/2)\\log_2(1/2) = 1 \\text{ bit}.$$\nThe average output state is a maximally mixed state:\n$$\\bar{\\rho}_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{1}{2}|0\\rangle\\langle0| + \\frac{1}{2}|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\frac{1}{2}I$$\nThe entropy is $S(I/2) = \\log_2(2) = 1$.\n\nSo, the maximal Holevo information is:\n$$\\chi(\\mathcal{E}) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} S(\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_1)) + \\frac{1}{2} S(\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_2))\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0\\right) = 1$$\nThus, the classical capacity of the channel is 1 bit.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "50846"}, {"introduction": "Quantum channels are not just abstract mathematical objects; they often arise from concrete physical processes, including operations within a quantum circuit.
