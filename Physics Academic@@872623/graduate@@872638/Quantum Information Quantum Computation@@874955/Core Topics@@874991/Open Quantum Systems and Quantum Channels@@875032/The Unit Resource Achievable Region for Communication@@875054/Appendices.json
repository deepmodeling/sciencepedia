Consider a scenario involving two parties, Alice and Bob. Alice possesses a single qubit, labeled A, and Bob possesses two qubits, labeled B1 and B2. They can perform any local quantum operation on their own qubits and communicate classically with each other; these capabilities are considered free resources (a framework known as LOCC).\n\nThe central resource they share is a single application of a controlled-controlled-Z (CCZ) gate, a three-qubit unitary operation. The CCZ gate acts on the computational basis states $|i,j,k\\rangle$ (where $i$ is the state of qubit A, and $j,k$ are the states of B1 and B2, respectively) as follows:\n$$U_{CCZ}|i,j,k\\rangle = (-1)^{ijk}|i,j,k\\rangle$$\n\nThis single use of the CCZ gate, supplemented by free LOCC, enables one-way communication from Alice to Bob. The performance is characterized by an achievable region in the C-Q plane, representing the trade-off between the classical capacity $C$ (in bits) and the quantum capacity $Q$ (in qubits). The boundary of this region connects the point of maximum classical capacity, $(C_{max}, 0)$, and the point of maximum quantum capacity, $(0, Q_{max})$. Assuming a linear trade-off, this boundary is described by the line segment $C/C_{max} + Q/Q_{max} = 1$ for $C, Q \\ge 0$.\n\nYour task is to derive the value of the sum of the maximum one-way capacities, $C_{max} + Q_{max}$.", "solution": "We evaluate the Schmidt decomposition of $U_{CCZ}$ across the Alice–Bob partition.
