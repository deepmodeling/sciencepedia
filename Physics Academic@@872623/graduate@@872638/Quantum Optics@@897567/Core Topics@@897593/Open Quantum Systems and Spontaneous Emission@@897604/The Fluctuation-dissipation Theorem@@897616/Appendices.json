The investigation consists of two separate experimental procedures.\n\nIn the first experiment (the \"fluctuation\" experiment), all external fields are turned off, and the probe undergoes rotational Brownian motion due to thermal collisions with the liquid's molecules. The probe's orientation angle, $\\theta(t)$, is recorded over time. The statistical analysis of this random motion reveals that the mean-squared angular displacement over a time interval $\\Delta t$ is directly proportional to the interval, following the equation $\\langle (\\Delta\\theta)^2 \\rangle = C \\Delta t$.
