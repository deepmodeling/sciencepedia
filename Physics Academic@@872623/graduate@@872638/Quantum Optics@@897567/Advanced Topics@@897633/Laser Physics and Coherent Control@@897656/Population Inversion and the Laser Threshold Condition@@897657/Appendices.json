This medium is modeled as a four-level atomic system, which is optically pumped to achieve a population inversion between two of its energy levels, the upper laser level (population density $N_2$) and the lower laser level (population density $N_1$). The transition between these levels has a frequency $\\nu_0$ and a stimulated emission cross-section at line center given by $\\sigma(\\nu_0)$.

An efficient laser requires not only pumping atoms to the upper state but also quickly removing them from the lower state to prevent a population bottleneck.

The energy levels are denoted $E_1$ (ground state), $E_2$ (lower laser level), $E_3$ (upper laser level), and $E_4$ (pump level), in order of increasing energy. An external pump excites atoms from $E_1$ to $E_4$. These atoms then decay via a very fast non-radiative transition to $E_3$. The intended laser transition is between $E_3$ and $E_2$. To complete the cycle, atoms in state $E_2$ must return to the ground state $E_1$.\n\nThe characteristic spontaneous lifetime of the upper laser level $E_3$ (for the $E_3 \\to E_2$ decay) is $\\tau_3$. The lifetime of the lower laser level $E_2$ (for the $E_2 \\to E_1$ decay) is $\\tau_2$.\n\nA critical design flaw is discovered: the $E_2 \\to E_1$ transition is semi-forbidden, resulting in a very long lifetime for the lower laser level, such that $\\tau_2 \\gg \\tau_3$.

It prevents the system from achieving the necessary steady-state population inversion between levels $E_3$ and $E_2$, making continuous-wave operation impossible.\n\nE. It shifts the laser's operating wavelength to correspond to the $E_2 \\to E_1$ transition, as this is now the slowest step in the cycle.", "solution": "Let $N_{i}$ denote the populations of levels $E_{i}$, and let $N$ be the total active-ion density, with $N = N_{1} + N_{2} + N_{3}$ (we ignore $E_{4}$ because $E_{4} \\to E_{3}$ is assumed instantaneous).

We neglect all other channels as stated.\n\nNear threshold and in assessing the possibility of steady-state inversion, we can neglect the stimulated term because the intracavity field is vanishingly small at threshold; moreover, including stimulated emission $E_{3} \\to E_{2}$ only increases $N_{2}$ and therefore makes inversion more difficult.

Therefore a steady-state population inversion between $E_{3}$ and $E_{2}$ cannot be achieved.\n\nFor completeness, in the high-pump limit one can eliminate $N_{1}$ explicitly using $N = N_{1} + N_{2} + N_{3}$ together with the steady-state relations to obtain\n$$\nN_{3} = \\frac{W \\tau_{3}}{1 + W \\tau_{3} + W \\tau_{2}}\\, N,\n\\qquad\nN_{2} = \\frac{W \\tau_{2}}{1 + W \\tau_{3} + W \\tau_{2}}\\, N,\n$$\nwhich yields\n$$\n\\Delta N = \\frac{W(\\tau_{3} - \\tau_{2})}{1 + W \\tau_{3} + W \\tau_{2}}\\, N < 0 \\quad \\text{when} \\quad \\tau_{2} > \\tau_{3}.\n$$\nIncluding stimulated emission $E_{3} \\to E_{2}$ would add a term that further transfers population from $E_{3}$ to $E_{2}$, which can only decrease $\\Delta N$ further. Hence, the long lifetime $\\tau_{2}$ produces a population bottleneck in $E_{2}$ that prevents achieving the necessary steady-state inversion on the $E_{3} \\to E_{2}$ transition, making continuous-wave operation unviable.\n\nThis directly rules out options A, B, C, and E: the effect is significant and detrimental (not neutral), it does not improve efficiency, it is worse than a standard three-level scheme because the lower laser level cannot be rapidly emptied, and it does not change the lasing wavelength; rather, it prevents lasing on the intended transition.
