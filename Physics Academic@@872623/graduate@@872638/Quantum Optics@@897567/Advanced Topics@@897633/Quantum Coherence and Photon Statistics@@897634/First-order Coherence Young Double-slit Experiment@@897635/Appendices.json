By working through this problem, you will gain hands-on experience in how the geometry of a source, such as a distant double star, directly dictates the coherence properties of its light and the resulting interference pattern [@problem_id:676063].", "problem": "A classic Young's double-slit experiment is set up to measure the spatial coherence of light from a distant source. The experiment consists of an opaque screen with two narrow parallel slits, S1 and S2, separated by a distance $d$. An observation screen is placed a large distance away from the slits. The interference pattern formed on the observation screen is characterized by its fringe visibility, $V$, defined as\n$$V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}}$$\nwhere $I_{max}$ and $I_{min}$ are the maximum and minimum intensities of the interference fringes, respectively.\n\nFor quasi-monochromatic light and under the assumption that the slits are equally illuminated, the visibility is given by the modulus of the complex degree of first-order coherence between the electric fields at the two slits, $V = |\\gamma_{12}|$. The complex degree of coherence is defined as $\\gamma_{12} = \\frac{J_{12}}{\\sqrt{I_1 I_2}}$, where $J_{12}$ is the mutual coherence function and $I_1, I_2$ are the intensities at each slit.\n\nThe van Cittert-Zernike theorem states that, under the paraxial approximation, the mutual coherence function $J_{12}$ generated by a spatially incoherent, quasi-monochromatic source is proportional to the Fourier transform of the source's intensity distribution $I(x_s, y_s)$.

The line sources are parallel to the y-axis, are of the same length $W$, and are located in the source plane at a distance $L$ from the slits. The first line source is positioned at $x_s = a$ and has a uniform intensity per unit length of $I_a$. The second line source is positioned at $x_s = -a$ and has a uniform intensity per unit length of $I_b$.\n\nDerive the expression for the fringe visibility $V$ in terms of the parameters $k, d, a, L, I_a,$ and $I_b$.", "solution": "We have the fringe visibility  \n$$V=|\\gamma_{12}|,\\quad \\gamma_{12}=\\frac{J_{12}}{\\sqrt{I_1I_2}},$$  \nand under equal illumination $I_1=I_2$ so $\\sqrt{I_1I_2}=I_1$.
