This process conserves energy, $\\omega_p = \\omega_s + \\omega_i$. For efficient conversion, momentum must also be conserved, a condition known as phase matching.\n\nIn a periodically poled crystal, the phase-matching condition is modified by a grating vector $K_g$ associated with the poling period $\\Lambda$.

In type-II SPDC, birefringent walk-off causes the orthogonally polarized signal and idler photons to follow slightly different spatial paths, introducing a form of \"which-path\" information that degrades entanglement. This practice [@problem_id:736577] guides you through quantifying this effect by calculating the purity of the final polarization state, offering a clear example of how information in one degree of freedom (spatial) can reduce coherence in another (polarization).", "problem": "In a type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process, a pump photon is converted into a pair of photons, signal (s) and idler (i), with orthogonal polarizations. Ideally, this process can generate a maximally polarization-entangled state. However, in a real birefringent crystal, the extraordinary-polarized (e-wave) and ordinary-polarized (o-wave) components of light travel along slightly different paths. This phenomenon, known as birefringent walk-off, introduces spatial distinguishability between the different polarization components of the two-photon state, which in turn degrades the purity of the polarization entanglement.\n\nConsider a simplified one-dimensional model for this effect. The generated photons' spatial properties are described by transverse Gaussian mode profiles. The normalized mode profile for a photon centered at $x=x_c$ is given by the wavefunction $\\psi(x-x_c)$, where $\\psi(x) = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi w_0^2}\\right)^{1/4} \\exp(-x^2/w_0^2)$ and $w_0$ is the mode's beam waist.\n\nIn the nonlinear crystal, let the horizontal polarization (H) correspond to the ordinary wave (o-wave) and the vertical polarization (V) to the extraordinary wave (e-wave). Due to walk-off, the center of the e-wave's spatial profile is displaced by a distance $\\delta_x$ relative to the o-wave's profile, which we assume is centered at $x=0$. Therefore, an o-polarized photon is described by the spatial state $|\\psi_o\\rangle$ with wavefunction $\\psi(x)$, while an e-polarized photon is described by the spatial state $|\\psi_e\\rangle$ with wavefunction $\\psi(x-\\delta_x)$.\n\nThe two-photon state produced by the SPDC process, including both polarization and spatial degrees of freedom, is given by:\n$$\n|\\Psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |H\\rangle_s |\\psi_o\\rangle_s \\otimes |V\\rangle_i |\\psi_e\\rangle_i + |V\\rangle_s |\\psi_e\\rangle_s \\otimes |H\\rangle_i |\\psi_o\\rangle_i \\right)\n$$\nThe purity of the two-photon polarization state is defined as $\\mathcal{P} = \\text{Tr}(\\rho_{pol}^2)$, where $\\rho_{pol}$ is the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out the spatial degrees of freedom: $\\rho_{pol} = \\text{Tr}_{spatial}(|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|)$.\n\nDerive an expression for the purity $\\mathcal{P}$ as a function of the walk-off displacement $\\delta_x$ and the beam waist $w_0$.", "solution": "The joint two-photon state including spatial modes is\n$$\n|\\Psi\\rangle = \\frac1{\\sqrt2}\\Bigl(|H\\rangle_s|\\psi_o\\rangle_s\\otimes|V\\rangle_i|\\psi_e\\rangle_i\n+|V\\rangle_s|\\psi_e\\rangle_s\\otimes|H\\rangle_i|\\psi_o\\rangle_i\\Bigr).\n$$\nThe spatial overlap between o- and e-modes is\n$$\nS=\\langle\\psi_o|\\psi_e\\rangle\n=\\int \\psi(x)\\psi(x-\\delta_x)\\,dx\n=\\exp\\!\\bigl(-\\delta_x^2/(2w_0^2)\\bigr).\n$$\nTracing out the spatial DOF yields the polarization density matrix in the $\\{|HV\\rangle,|VH\\rangle\\}$ basis:\n$$\n\\rho_{pol}\n=\\frac12\\begin{pmatrix}1 & S^2\\\\ S^2 & 1\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nIts eigenvalues are\n$$\n\\lambda_\\pm=\\frac12\\,(1\\pm S^2),\n$$\nso the purity is\n$$\n\\mathcal P\n=\\lambda_+^2+\\lambda_-^2\n=\\frac14\\bigl((1+S^2)^2+(1-S^2)^2\\bigr)\n=\\frac12\\,(1+S^4)\n=\\frac{1+e^{-2\\delta_x^2/w_0^2}}{2}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1+e^{-2\\delta_x^2/w_0^2}}{2}}$$", "id": "736577"}, {"introduction": "The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect is a hallmark quantum interference phenomenon and a primary tool for characterizing the indistinguishability of single photons.

This compensation ensures that the temporal centers of the two photon wavepackets arrive at the beam splitter simultaneously, effectively cancelling any distinguishability arising from the $k'(\\omega_0)$ term.
