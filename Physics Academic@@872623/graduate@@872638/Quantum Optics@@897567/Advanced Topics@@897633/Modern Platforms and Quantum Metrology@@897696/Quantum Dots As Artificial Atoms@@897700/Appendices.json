First, we derive the relationship between the addition energy and the gate voltage spacing between Coulomb peaks. Second, we substitute the given numerical values to calculate the final answer.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation**\n\nIn the constant-interaction model, the electrostatic energy of a quantum dot with $N$ electrons, coupled to a gate voltage $V_g$, is given by:\n$$E(N, V_g) = \\frac{(-Ne + C_g V_g)^2}{2C_\\Sigma} + \\text{const.}$$\nwhere $Q = -Ne$ is the charge on the dot, $C_g$ is the gate capacitance, and $C_\\Sigma = C_g + C_s + C_d$ is the total capacitance.

The total addition energy, $E_{add}(N+1)$, is the energy difference between consecutive chemical potentials at a fixed gate voltage:\n$$E_{add}(N+1) = \\mu(N+1, V_g) - \\mu(N, V_g)$$\nUsing our expression for $\\mu(N, V_g)$:\n$$E_{add}(N+1) = \\left[ \\frac{e^2(2(N+1)-1)}{2C_\\Sigma} - \\frac{eC_gV_g}{C_\\Sigma} \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{e^2(2N-1)}{2C_\\Sigma} - \\frac{eC_gV_g}{C_\\Sigma} \\right]$$\n$$E_{add}(N+1) = \\frac{e^2}{2C_\\Sigma}((2N+1) - (2N-1)) = \\frac{e^2}{C_\\Sigma}$$\nThis is the charging energy $E_c$.
