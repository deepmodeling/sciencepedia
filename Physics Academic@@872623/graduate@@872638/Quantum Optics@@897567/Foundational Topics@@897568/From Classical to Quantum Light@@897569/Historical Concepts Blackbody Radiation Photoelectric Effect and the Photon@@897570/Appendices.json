A fundamental property is the pressure it exerts on the walls of its enclosure. This exercise guides you to derive the famous relation $P = u/3$ not from thermodynamic arguments, but from first principles of classical electrodynamics. By calculating the time-averaged Lorentz force exerted by an isotropic field on a perfectly conducting surface, you will solidify your understanding of how macroscopic pressure emerges from the momentum transfer of microscopic electromagnetic fields [@problem_id:681569].", "problem": "An isotropic, unpolarized electromagnetic field is contained within a large cavity with perfectly conducting walls. This radiation field has a total time-averaged energy density $u$. The radiation exerts a pressure $P$ on the walls of the cavity.\n\nDerive the fundamental relation between the radiation pressure $P$ and the energy density $u$ by directly calculating the Lorentz force on a flat section of the conducting wall. Your final answer should be the ratio $P/u$.\n\nTo guide your derivation, follow these steps:\n1.  Model the isotropic field as a superposition of incoherent plane waves incident from all directions over a hemisphere. For an isotropic field of total energy density $u$, the energy density per unit solid angle is uniform and given by $u_{\\Omega} = u/(4\\pi)$. The energy density of a single incident plane wave is denoted $u_{\\text{wave}}$.\n2.  Consider a single monochromatic plane wave of arbitrary polarization incident on the wall at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the normal. The wall lies in the $xy$-plane at $z=0$, with the conductor occupying the $z<0$ region.\n3.  Calculate the total electric and magnetic fields in the region $z>0$ by applying the boundary conditions for a perfect conductor.\n4.  The time-averaged force per unit area on the wall is given by the Lorentz force, $\\mathbf{f} = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\sigma \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{K} \\times \\mathbf{B} \\rangle$, where $\\sigma$ is the surface charge density, $\\mathbf{K}$ is the surface current density, and $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ are the fields just outside the conductor. The factor of $1/2$ accounts for the fact that the fields inside the perfect conductor are zero. The surface charge and current are related to the fields at the surface by $\\sigma = \\epsilon_0 (\\mathbf{\\hat{n}} \\cdot \\mathbf{E})$ and $\\mathbf{K} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(\\mathbf{\\hat{n}} \\times \\mathbf{B})$, where $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}=\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$ is the outward normal from the conductor.\n5.  Derive the pressure $P(\\theta)$ exerted by this single wave, showing it is independent of polarization, and relate it to $u_{\\text{wave}}$.\n6.  Integrate the pressure contribution from all incident waves over the appropriate solid angle to find the total pressure $P$ in terms of the total energy density $u$. Finally, determine the ratio $P/u$.\n\nYou may use the following constants: permeability of free space $\\mu_0$, permittivity of free space $\\epsilon_0$, and the speed of light in vacuum $c$.", "solution": "The radiation pressure can be derived by considering the momentum transferred by the electromagnetic waves to the wall.\n\n1.  First, consider the pressure exerted by a single plane wave incident at an angle $\\theta$ to the normal of a perfectly reflecting surface. The time-averaged energy density of the incident wave is $u_{\\text{inc}}$. The momentum flux (momentum per unit area per unit time) of the wave along its direction of propagation has a magnitude equal to its energy density, $u_{\\text{inc}}$.\n2.  The pressure on a surface is the force per unit area, which is equal to the rate of transfer of momentum normal to the surface, per unit area. For a wave incident at angle $\\theta$, the momentum flux normal to the wall is $u_{\\text{inc}} \\cos\\theta$. Upon perfect reflection, the normal component of momentum is reversed. The total pressure $P(\\theta)$ exerted by this wave is thus twice the incident normal momentum flux component projected onto the normal:\n    $$ P(\\theta) = 2 u_{\\text{inc}} \\cos^2\\theta $$\n3.  The field is isotropic, so radiation comes from all directions uniformly. The total energy density $u$ is distributed over a full solid angle of $4\\pi$. Thus, the energy density per unit solid angle is $u_{\\Omega} = u/(4\\pi)$.\n4.  The total pressure $P$ is the sum of contributions from all waves incident on the wall, i.e., from all directions within a hemisphere ($2\\pi$ steradians). The pressure contribution $dP$ from waves in a solid angle $d\\Omega = \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi$ is:\n    $$ dP = 2 (u_{\\Omega} d\\Omega) \\cos^2\\theta $$\n    Here, $u_{\\Omega} d\\Omega$ is the energy density of the incident waves from that direction.\n5.  Integrating over the hemisphere gives the total pressure:\n    $$ P = \\int_{\\text{hemisphere}} dP = \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^{\\pi/2} 2 \\left(\\frac{u}{4\\pi}\\right) \\cos^2\\theta \\sin\\theta d\\theta $$\n    The integral over $\\phi$ yields $2\\pi$.\n    $$ P = 2 \\left(\\frac{u}{4\\pi}\\right) (2\\pi) \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\cos^2\\theta \\sin\\theta d\\theta = u \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\cos^2\\theta \\sin\\theta d\\theta $$\n6.  To solve the integral, let $x = \\cos\\theta$, so $dx = -\\sin\\theta d\\theta$. The limits of integration change from $[0, \\pi/2]$ to $[1, 0]$.\n    $$ P = u \\int_1^0 -x^2 dx = u \\left[ -\\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_1^0 = u \\left( 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{u}{3} $$\n7.
