{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before we can calculate any physical process, we must first determine all the ways the interaction can happen. Feynman diagrams provide a powerful visual language for this, but simply drawing pictures isn't enough; we need a systematic way to enumerate them. This first practice focuses on that foundational skill, asking you to determine the number of distinct tree-level diagrams for a $2 \\to 4$ scattering process in $\\phi^4$ theory [@problem_id:313828]. By combining simple topological rules with basic combinatorics, you will build the \"blueprints\" of the interaction, a crucial first step in any perturbative calculation.", "problem": "Consider a quantum field theory of a real scalar field $\\phi$ in four spacetime dimensions, described by the Lagrangian density:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 - \\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4\n$$\nThis theory possesses a single interaction vertex corresponding to the $\\phi^4$ term. We are interested in the scattering process where two initial particles scatter into four final particles:\n$$\n\\phi + \\phi \\to \\phi + \\phi + \\phi + \\phi\n$$\nYour task is to calculate the total number, $N$, of distinct, connected, tree-level Feynman diagrams for this $2 \\to 4$ scattering process.\n\nA diagram is considered \"distinct\" if it cannot be made identical to another by relabeling the internal vertices. The external lines are considered labeled (e.g., by their respective momenta).", "solution": "Let $E$ be the number of external lines, $I$ the number of internal lines (propagators), and $V$ the number of vertices in a Feynman diagram.\n\nThe scattering process is $2 \\to 4$, so the total number of external lines is $E = 2 + 4 = 6$. The problem states that we are interested in connected, tree-level diagrams.\n\nFor any connected graph without loops (a tree), the number of vertices and internal lines are related by the topological formula:\n$$\nV = I + 1\n$$\nThe Lagrangian specifies a $\\phi^4$ interaction, which means that every vertex in a Feynman diagram must have exactly four lines connected to it. By counting the endpoints of all lines in the diagram, we can establish another relation between $E$, $I$, and $V$. The total number of line endpoints is $4V$, since each of the $V$ vertices has 4 lines attached. These endpoints must correspond to either an external line (which has one end at a vertex) or an internal line (which has both ends at vertices).\n$$\n4V = E + 2I\n$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $V$ and $I$, with $E=6$:\n1.  $V = I + 1$\n2.  $4V = 6 + 2I$\n\nWe can solve this system. Substitute eq. (1) into eq. (2):\n$$\n4(I+1) = 6 + 2I\n$$\n$$\n4I + 4 = 6 + 2I\n$$\n$$\n2I = 2\n$$\n$$\nI = 1\n$$\nUsing $I=1$ in eq. (1), we find the number of vertices:\n$$\nV = 1 + 1 = 2\n$$\nThus, every connected, tree-level Feynman diagram for this process must have exactly two vertices and one internal line. The single internal line connects the two vertices.\n\nEach vertex has 4 line \"slots\". One slot on each vertex is used by the internal line connecting them. This leaves $4-1=3$ slots on each vertex available for external lines. The total number of external lines is 6, which perfectly matches the $3+3=6$ available slots.\n\nThe problem of finding the number of distinct diagrams is now reduced to a combinatorial problem: in how many distinct ways can we attach the 6 labeled external lines to this two-vertex structure? This is equivalent to counting the number of ways to partition the set of 6 distinct external lines into two groups of 3.\n\nLet the set of external lines be $L$. The number of ways to choose 3 lines from the 6 available for the first vertex is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{6}{3}$:\n$$\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\n$$\nOnce 3 lines are chosen for the first vertex, the remaining 3 are automatically assigned to the second vertex.\n\nHowever, the two vertices are indistinguishable. A diagram where lines $\\{l_1, l_2, l_3\\}$ are attached to vertex A and $\\{l_4, l_5, l_6\\}$ are attached to vertex B is topologically identical to the diagram where $\\{l_4, l_5, l_6\\}$ are on vertex A and $\\{l_1, l_2, l_3\\}$ are on vertex B. This means we have counted each distinct diagram twice. Therefore, we must divide our result by 2.\n\nThe total number of distinct diagrams, $N$, is:\n$$\nN = \\frac{1}{2} \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 = 10\n$$\n\nAlternatively, we can label the initial particles by momenta $\\{p_1, p_2\\}$ and final particles by $\\{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4\\}$. Consider the vertex to which $p_1$ attaches. It must have two other external lines attached. We have two disjoint cases:\n1.  The other initial particle, $p_2$, attaches to the same vertex. To complete the group of three, one final particle must be chosen. There are $\\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways to choose which of the four final particles attaches to this vertex. The remaining 3 final particles attach to the other vertex. This gives 4 distinct diagrams.\n2.  The other initial particle, $p_2$, attaches to the other vertex. Then, the vertex with $p_1$ must be completed by two final particles. There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose two particles from the four final ones. The remaining two final particles attach to the other vertex along with $p_2$. This gives 6 distinct diagrams.\n\nSumming the possibilities from these two mutually exclusive cases, the total number of distinct diagrams is $N = 4 + 6 = 10$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$", "id": "313828"}, {"introduction": "Once we have drawn the relevant diagrams, we must assign them the correct mathematical weight.
