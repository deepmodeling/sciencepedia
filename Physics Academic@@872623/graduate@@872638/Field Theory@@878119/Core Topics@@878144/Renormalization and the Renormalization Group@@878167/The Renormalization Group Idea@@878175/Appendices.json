This exercise provides a tangible illustration using a real-space RG procedure, where we iteratively coarse-grain a system and demand that its effective description remains unchanged at a critical point. By applying a majority-rule decimation to the 2D triangular Ising model, you will perform a hands-on calculation to locate the non-trivial fixed-point coupling constant, the very point where the system exhibits the self-similarity characteristic of critical phenomena [@problem_id:422061].", "problem": "Consider the Ising model on a two-dimensional triangular lattice. The Hamiltonian is given by\n$$H = -J \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} s_i s_j$$\nwhere $s_i = \\pm 1$ are spin variables at each site $i$ of the lattice, and the sum runs over all nearest-neighbor pairs. We introduce the dimensionless coupling constant $K = \\beta J$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\nWe wish to study the critical properties of this system using a real-space renormalization group (RG) approach. The procedure is as follows:\n1.  The lattice is partitioned into disjoint 3-spin cells, each forming an elementary triangle.\n2.  A new block spin $S_A = \\pm 1$ is assigned to each cell $A$ according to the majority rule: $S_A = \\text{sgn}(s_1 + s_2 + s_3)$, where $s_1, s_2, s_3$ are the spins in cell $A$.\n3.  The block spins form a new, rescaled triangular lattice. Each cell interacts with six neighboring cells. The interaction between any two adjacent cells, $A$ and $B$, occurs via a fixed number of bonds, $p$, from the original lattice connecting spins in cell $A$ to spins in cell $B$. For this specific blocking geometry, you are given that $p=2$.\n4.  The new Hamiltonian for the block spins, $H'$, is assumed to have the same form as the original, $H' = -J' \\sum_{\\langle A,B \\rangle} S_A S_B$, defining a new coupling $K' = \\beta J'$.\n5.  The relationship between $K$ and $K'$ is determined using a first-order cumulant expansion. The Hamiltonian is split into intra-cell and inter-cell parts, $H = H_0 + V$. The renormalized Hamiltonian is approximated by keeping only the expectation value of the inter-cell coupling $V$ with respect to the unperturbed part $e^{-\\beta H_0}$.\n\nYour task is to calculate the non-trivial critical fixed point, $K_c$, of this RG transformation.
