Physical states are identified as elements of the cohomology of the BRST charge operator $Q$. A key property of this formalism is that BRST-exact states, which are of the form $Q|\\chi\\rangle$ for some state $|\\chi\\rangle$, are null states, i.e., they have zero norm.\n\nThis problem involves an explicit verification of this property for a specific state. Consider the QED Lagrangian in a general covariant gauge, with the gauge-fixing and Faddeev-Popov ghost terms:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = -\\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2\\xi} (\\partial_\\mu A^\\mu)^2 - \\partial_\\mu \\bar{c} \\, \\partial^\\mu c $$\nwhere $A^\\mu$ is the photon field, $c$ and $\\bar{c}$ are the ghost and anti-ghost fields respectively, and $\\xi$ is the gauge-fixing parameter. We work in Minkowski spacetime with metric $g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\text{diag}(1, -1, -1, -1)$.\n\nThe canonical quantization of this theory on a Fock space $\\mathcal{F}$ leads to creation and annihilation operators for photons ($a_\\mu^\\dagger, a_\\mu$), ghosts ($c^\\dagger, c$), and anti-ghosts ($\\bar{c}^\\dagger, \\bar{c}$). These operators obey the following non-zero (anti-)commutation relations (for on-shell momenta $k,p$ where $k^2=p^2=0$):\n$$ [a_\\mu(k), a_\\nu^\\dagger(p)] = -g_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta_{kp}, \\quad \\{c(k), \\bar{c}^\\dagger(p)\\} = \\delta_{kp}, \\quad \\{\\bar{c}(k), c^\\dagger(p)\\} = \\delta_{kp} $$\nwhere $\\delta_{kp} \\equiv (2\\pi)^3 2k_0 \\delta^{(3)}(\\vec{k}-\\vec{p})$. The vacuum state $|0\\rangle$ is annihilated by all annihilation operators. The inner product on $\\mathcal{F}$ is the one naturally induced by these relations.\n\nThe BRST charge operator $Q$ is defined by its (anti-)commutation relations with the fundamental field operators. Its action on the creation operators is given by:\n$$ [Q, a_\\mu^\\dagger(k)] = k_\\mu c^\\dagger(k) $$\n$$ \\{Q, c^\\dagger(k)\\} = 0 $$\n$$ \\{Q, \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k)\\} = \\frac{1}{\\xi} k_\\mu a^{\\mu\\dagger}(k) $$\nThe BRST charge annihilates the vacuum: $Q|0\\rangle=0$.\n\nConsider a normalized single anti-ghost state $|\\bar{c}_f\\rangle$ defined by a wavepacket $f(k)$:\n$$ |\\bar{c}_f\\rangle = \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3 2k_0} f(k) \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k) |0\\rangle $$\nwhere the wavepacket $f(k)$ is normalized such that $\\langle \\bar{c}_f | c_f \\rangle = 1$ (with $|c_f\\rangle$ being the corresponding ghost state). This normalization detail, however, will not be essential for the final result.\n\nYour task is to compute the norm of the BRST-exact state $|\\Psi_f\\rangle = Q|\\bar{c}_f\\rangle$.

First, let's construct this state explicitly. The initial state is $|\\bar{c}_f\\rangle = \\int d\\mu(k) f(k) \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k) |0\\rangle$, where $d\\mu(k) = \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3 2k_0}$ is the Lorentz-invariant measure.\n\nWe apply the BRST charge operator $Q$ to this state. Using the linearity of $Q$ and the fact that it anticommutes with the fermionic operator $\\bar{c}^\\dagger(k)$, we have:\n$$ |\\Psi_f\\rangle = Q|\\bar{c}_f\\rangle = \\int d\\mu(k) f(k) Q \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k) |0\\rangle = \\int d\\mu(k) f(k) \\{Q, \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k)\\} |0\\rangle $$\nwhere we used $Q|0\\rangle=0$.

The creation operators create massless particles, so their four-momentum $k$ must be on the mass shell, satisfying the condition $k^2 = k_0^2 - \\vec{k}^2 = 0$.\nTherefore, the factor $k^2$ inside the integral is zero. The entire integrand is zero, and the norm of the state is zero.\n$$ \\langle \\Psi_f | \\Psi_f \\rangle = 0 $$\nThis confirms that the BRST-exact state $|\\Psi_f\\rangle$ is a null state, regardless of the wavepacket $f(k)$ or the gauge parameter $\\xi$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0} $$", "id": "353889"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how the BRST formalism structures the state space, we now turn to its implications for the path integral.
