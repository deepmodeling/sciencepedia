## Introduction
Conformal symmetry represents a powerful extension of the familiar Poincaré symmetries of spacetime, governing physical systems that appear the same at all length scales. This invariance is not just an abstract curiosity but a cornerstone of modern theoretical physics, appearing at the [critical points](@entry_id:144653) of phase transitions, in the high-energy limit of certain gauge theories, and as a key ingredient in the holographic description of quantum gravity. At the heart of this symmetry lies the [conformal group](@entry_id:156186), a rich mathematical structure whose physical implications are both profound and far-reaching. This article aims to demystify this structure by exploring the algebra of its generators and its consequences for quantum field theories.

We will begin in the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, by dissecting the Lie algebra of the [conformal group](@entry_id:156186) in arbitrary dimensions. This section will introduce the fundamental concepts of [primary operators](@entry_id:151517), the [state-operator correspondence](@entry_id:156407), and the powerful [unitarity bounds](@entry_id:150630) that constrain the theory's spectrum. Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will see how these principles are applied in practice, revealing how [conformal symmetry](@entry_id:142366) provides exact results for critical phenomena in statistical mechanics, places restrictions on gauge theories, and forms the basis for the revolutionary AdS/CFT correspondence. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** chapter will offer a series of targeted problems designed to solidify your understanding of the algebraic and physical aspects of [conformal symmetry](@entry_id:142366). By navigating these chapters, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the [conformal group](@entry_id:156186) and its central role in defining a Conformal Field Theory (CFT).

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the foundational principles and mechanisms of Conformal Field Theory (CFT), building upon the introductory concepts of [conformal transformations](@entry_id:159863). We will explore the algebraic structure of the [conformal group](@entry_id:156186), its representations in terms of quantum operators, and the profound constraints this symmetry imposes on the [physical observables](@entry_id:154692) of a theory, such as correlation functions and operator spectra.

### The Conformal Algebra and its Generators

In a $d$-dimensional spacetime, the generators of the [conformal group](@entry_id:156186) are [vector fields](@entry_id:161384) $\xi^\mu(x)$ that solve the **conformal Killing equation**. In flat spacetime, the solutions to this equation give rise to a finite-dimensional Lie algebra. The generators correspond to:
*   **Translations**, generated by $P_\mu$.
*   **Lorentz transformations** (rotations and boosts), generated by $M_{\mu\nu}$.
*   **Dilatations** (scale transformations), generated by $D$.
*   **Special Conformal Transformations** (SCTs), generated by $K_\mu$.

These operators form a closed Lie algebra, whose structure is defined by their [commutation relations](@entry_id:136780). In a quantum theory, these generators are operators acting on a Hilbert space. For a theory in Minkowski spacetime with metric $\eta_{\mu\nu}$, and choosing a basis where the [structure constants](@entry_id:157960) are imaginary, the non-zero [commutation relations](@entry_id:136780) are given as follows [@problem_id:395827]:

$$
[M_{\mu\nu}, P_\rho] = i(\eta_{\nu\rho}P_\mu - \eta_{\mu\rho}P_\nu)
$$
$$
[M_{\mu\nu}, K_\rho] = i(\eta_{\nu\rho}K_\mu - \eta_{\mu\rho}K_\nu)
$$
$$
[M_{\mu\nu}, M_{\rho\sigma}] = i(\eta_{\mu\rho}M_{\nu\sigma} - \eta_{\nu\rho}M_{\mu\sigma} + \eta_{\mu\sigma}M_{\rho\nu} - \eta_{\nu\sigma}M_{\rho\mu})
$$
$$
[D, P_\mu] = iP_\mu
$$
$$
[D, K_\mu] = -iK_\mu
$$
$$
[K_\mu, P_\nu] = 2i(\eta_{\mu\nu}D - M_{\mu\nu})
$$

The first three sets of relations define the Poincaré algebra. The commutators involving the dilatation generator $D$ indicate that $P_\mu$ and $K_\mu$ act as [raising and lowering operators](@entry_id:153228) for scale, respectively. The most intricate relation is the commutator between an SCT generator $K_\mu$ and a translation generator $P_\nu$. It closes on the dilatation and Lorentz generators, revealing the interconnectedness of all spacetime symmetries within the [conformal group](@entry_id:156186).

To gain a more concrete understanding of this algebraic structure, we can examine the Lie bracket of the [vector fields](@entry_id:161384) that generate these transformations. The vector field for an infinitesimal translation by $a^\mu$ is $\xi_a^\mu(x) = a^\mu$, and for an SCT with parameter $b^\mu$ it is $\xi_b^\mu(x) = b^\mu x^2 - 2(b \cdot x) x^\mu$. The commutator of the associated generators corresponds to the Lie bracket of these [vector fields](@entry_id:161384), $[\xi_a, \xi_b]^\mu = \xi_a^\nu \partial_\nu \xi_b^\mu - \xi_b^\nu \partial_\nu \xi_a^\mu$. A direct calculation [@problem_id:395825] reveals:

$$
[\xi_a, \xi_b]^\mu(x) = a^\nu \partial_\nu \left( b^\mu x^2 - 2(b \cdot x) x^\mu \right) = -2(a \cdot b)x^\mu + 2(b^\mu a_\nu - a^\mu b_\nu)x^\nu
$$

The first term, $-2(a \cdot b)x^\mu$, is the vector field for an infinitesimal dilatation with parameter $-2(a \cdot b)$. The second term is the vector field for an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation with parameter $\omega_{\mu\nu} = 2(a_\mu b_\nu - a_\nu b_\mu)$. This explicitly demonstrates how translations and SCTs combine to generate dilatations and rotations, consistent with the $[K_\mu, P_\nu]$ commutator.

While infinitesimal transformations are described by this Lie algebra, finite SCTs have a less intuitive form. However, they can be understood through a remarkable construction. A finite SCT is equivalent to a composition of an **inversion**, followed by a translation, and another inversion. Let the inversion operator be $I$, which maps a coordinate $x^\mu$ to $x'^\mu = x^\mu / x^2$. An SCT with parameter $b^\mu$ is then given by the sequence $\text{SCT}_b = I \circ T_{-b} \circ I$ [@problem_id:395826]. This decomposition is extremely useful for understanding the action of SCTs on fields and [correlation functions](@entry_id:146839).

### Representations: Primary Operators and States

In a quantum [field theory](@entry_id:155241), fields are operators that transform in specific ways under the symmetries of the theory. In a CFT, the operator content is organized according to representations of the [conformal algebra](@entry_id:159054). The most fundamental building blocks are the **[primary operators](@entry_id:151517)**.

A local operator $\mathcal{O}(x)$ is called a primary operator if it transforms simply under dilatations and SCTs. The state $|\mathcal{O}\rangle = \mathcal{O}(0)|0\rangle$, created by inserting the operator at the origin, provides a clean definition. A state $|\Delta, R\rangle$ is a **primary state** if it satisfies the following conditions [@problem_id:395917]:

1.  It is an eigenstate of the dilatation operator $D$:
    $$ D |\Delta, R\rangle = i\Delta |\Delta, R\rangle $$
    The eigenvalue $\Delta$ is a crucial parameter known as the **conformal dimension** (or [scaling dimension](@entry_id:145515)) of the operator. It governs how the operator's magnitude changes under a scale transformation.

2.  It transforms in an irreducible representation $R$ of the Lorentz group $SO(d)$:
    $$ M_{\mu\nu} |\Delta, R\rangle \text{ transforms within } R $$
    For a scalar operator, $R$ is the trivial representation, and $M_{\mu\nu}|\Delta\rangle = 0$. For operators with spin, such as fermions or vector currents, $M_{\mu\nu}$ acts non-trivially.

3.  It is annihilated by all [special conformal transformation](@entry_id:148985) generators:
    $$ K_\mu |\Delta, R\rangle = 0 $$
    This is the most restrictive condition and the hallmark of a primary operator. It implies that a primary operator, when placed at the origin, is a "ground state" with respect to SCTs.

Any operator that is not primary is called a **descendant operator**. All descendant operators can be generated by acting on a primary operator with the translation generator $P_\mu$. For instance, $\partial_\mu \mathcal{O}(x)$ is a descendant of $\mathcal{O}(x)$, and the corresponding state is $P_\mu |\mathcal{O}\rangle$. The set of a primary operator and all its descendants forms an [irreducible representation](@entry_id:142733) of the [conformal algebra](@entry_id:159054), often called a **conformal tower** or **conformal multiplet**. The entire [operator spectrum](@entry_id:276315) of a CFT can be decomposed into a sum of these conformal towers.

### The State-Operator Correspondence

One of the most profound and powerful principles in CFT is the **[state-operator correspondence](@entry_id:156407)**. It posits a one-to-one map between the set of all local operators in the theory and the set of states in the Hilbert space of the same theory quantized on the Einstein static universe, $\mathbb{R} \times S^{d-1}$. The time direction on the cylinder is denoted by $\tau$, and the sphere $S^{d-1}$ has a fixed radius.

This correspondence arises from a [conformal mapping](@entry_id:144027) that relates flat Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ to the cylinder. Under this map, the dilatation operator $D$ in flat space becomes the Hamiltonian $H_{\text{cyl}}$ that generates time translations on the cylinder. Consequently, an [eigenstate](@entry_id:202009) of $H_{\text{cyl}}$ with energy $E$ on the cylinder corresponds to a local operator in [flat space](@entry_id:204618) with [scaling dimension](@entry_id:145515) $\Delta = E$. The momentum on the sphere $S^{d-1}$ corresponds to the spin of the operator.

This correspondence provides a powerful dictionary between operator properties and spectral properties. For example, consider a free, massless, conformally coupled scalar field in $d$ dimensions. When mapped to the cylinder, the theory describes single-particle excitations with a discrete energy spectrum. The energy of a state with angular momentum quantum number $l$ on the sphere is given by $E_l = l + (d-2)/2$. According to the [state-operator correspondence](@entry_id:156407), these energies are precisely the scaling dimensions of the [primary operators](@entry_id:151517) of spin-$l$ built from the field $\phi$ and its derivatives.

The correspondence can be used to construct new CFTs from existing ones. Consider a theory defined on an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587), such as $\mathbb{R} \times (S^{d-1}/\mathbb{Z}_2)$, where the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ group identifies [antipodal points](@entry_id:151589) on the sphere [@problem_id:395892]. This projection restricts the Hilbert space to only include states that are even under the [antipodal map](@entry_id:151775). For [spherical harmonics](@entry_id:156424) $Y_{l,m}(\vec{n})$, which form the basis for wavefunctions on the sphere, this parity is $(-1)^l$. Therefore, the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) theory retains only states with even values of $l$. The original theory had operators for all integer spins $l \ge 0$. The new theory on the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) has operators only for spins $l=0, 2, 4, \dots$. The lowest-dimension non-scalar ($l>0$) primary operator in the original theory has $l=1$ and dimension $\Delta = 1 + (d-2)/2 = d/2$. In the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) theory, this operator is projected out. The new lowest-dimension non-scalar primary corresponds to $l=2$, with [scaling dimension](@entry_id:145515) $\Delta = 2 + (d-2)/2 = (d+2)/2$.

### Constraints on Correlation Functions

The requirement that vacuum correlation [functions of operators](@entry_id:183979) be invariant under all [conformal transformations](@entry_id:159863) imposes extremely powerful constraints on their functional form. These constraints are known as the **conformal Ward identities**.

For a **two-point function** of [primary operators](@entry_id:151517), [conformal symmetry](@entry_id:142366) fixes its form completely, up to a normalization constant. It is non-zero only if the operators have the same [scaling dimension](@entry_id:145515) and spin. For two scalar primaries, the correlator must be:
$$
\langle \mathcal{O}_1(x_1) \mathcal{O}_2(x_2) \rangle = \frac{C_{12} \delta_{\Delta_1, \Delta_2}}{|x_1 - x_2|^{2\Delta_1}}
$$
where $|x_1 - x_2|^2$ is the squared Euclidean distance. For operators with spin, the structure is also fixed. For a primary Dirac fermion field $\psi(x)$ of dimension $\Delta$, the two-point function takes the form [@problem_id:395880]:
$$
\langle \psi(x) \bar{\psi}(0) \rangle = C \frac{\gamma \cdot x}{(x^2)^{\Delta+1/2}}
$$
Here, $\gamma \cdot x = \gamma^\mu x_\mu$, and the presence of the gamma matrices encodes the [spinor transformation](@entry_id:161968) properties required by Lorentz invariance.

For a **three-point function** of scalar primaries, the functional form is also fixed by [conformal symmetry](@entry_id:142366) up to a single constant, $C_{123}$, known as an OPE coefficient:
$$
\langle \mathcal{O}_1(x_1) \mathcal{O}_2(x_2) \mathcal{O}_3(x_3) \rangle = \frac{C_{123}}{|x_{12}|^{\Delta_1+\Delta_2-\Delta_3} |x_{23}|^{\Delta_2+\Delta_3-\Delta_1} |x_{31}|^{\Delta_3+\Delta_1-\Delta_2}}
$$
where $x_{ij}=x_i-x_j$. This specific dependence of the exponents on the scaling dimensions can be derived by demanding invariance under SCTs [@problem_id:396016].

For **four-point functions** and higher, [conformal symmetry](@entry_id:142366) is no longer sufficient to fix the functional form completely. However, it constrains it to depend on an arbitrary function of conformally invariant **cross-ratios**. For four points $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$, two independent cross-ratios can be formed:
$$
u = \frac{x_{12}^2 x_{34}^2}{x_{13}^2 x_{24}^2}, \quad v = \frac{x_{14}^2 x_{23}^2}{x_{13}^2 x_{24}^2}
$$
The four-point function of identical scalar primaries takes the form:
$$
\langle \mathcal{O}(x_1)\mathcal{O}(x_2)\mathcal{O}(x_3)\mathcal{O}(x_4) \rangle = \frac{1}{(x_{12}^2 x_{34}^2)^\Delta} g(u, v)
$$
The function $g(u, v)$, known as the conformal block decomposition, contains the detailed dynamical information of the theory and is not fixed by symmetry alone.

The **[embedding space](@entry_id:637157) formalism** provides an elegant way to make these symmetry constraints manifest [@problem_id:395904]. In this formalism, a point $x^\mu \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is mapped to a null ray in a higher-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^{1,d+1}$. The key property is that the [conformal group](@entry_id:156186) on $\mathbb{R}^d$ becomes the much simpler Lorentz group $SO(1, d+1)$ of the [embedding space](@entry_id:637157). Correlation functions become functions of the [embedding space](@entry_id:637157) coordinates $X_i$ that are invariant under these Lorentz transformations. This implies they can only depend on the dot products $X_i \cdot X_j$, which are proportional to the squared distances $-x_{ij}^2$. The cross-ratios $u$ and $v$ emerge naturally as the only $SO(1,d+1)$-invariant combinations of four [null vectors](@entry_id:155273) that are independent of the ray representatives. The scaling property of the correlator is encoded as a homogeneity condition on the [embedding space](@entry_id:637157) function, which fixes the overall kinematic prefactors.

### Unitarity and its Consequences

In a physically realistic quantum field theory, the Hilbert space must have a positive-definite inner product. This property, known as **[unitarity](@entry_id:138773)**, ensures that probabilities are non-negative. In the context of CFT, via the [state-operator correspondence](@entry_id:156407), [unitarity](@entry_id:138773) implies that all states in a conformal tower must have non-negative norm. This requirement leads to powerful, universal lower bounds on the scaling dimensions of [primary operators](@entry_id:151517).

The bounds arise from studying the norms of descendant states. At level one, the states are $P_\mu |\Delta, R\rangle$. At level two, we have states like $P_\mu P_\nu |\Delta, R\rangle$, and so on. The norm of these states can be computed using the [conformal algebra](@entry_id:159054). For certain values of $\Delta$ and $d$, a descendant state can have zero norm. Such a state is called a **null state**. If a state has zero norm, all of its own descendants must also have zero norm. Furthermore, any state orthogonal to the entire tower of the primary must be considered physically equivalent, leading to a smaller, "shortened" representation of the [conformal group](@entry_id:156186).

A descendant state becomes a null state precisely when it also satisfies the primary condition of being annihilated by $K_\mu$. For instance, consider a scalar primary operator with dimension $\Delta$. A detailed analysis of the [conformal algebra](@entry_id:159054) [@problem_id:395917, @problem_id:395997] gives the following relation for the level-two descendant $P^2|\Delta\rangle$:
$$K_\mu P^2 |\Delta\rangle = 2i(d - 2\Delta - 2)P_\mu|\Delta\rangle$$
For the descendant to be a primary (and hence a null state), the right-hand side must be zero. As $P_\mu|\Delta\rangle$ is not generally zero, this implies $d - 2\Delta - 2 = 0$, or $\Delta = (d-2)/2$. This gives the famous unitarity bound for scalar operators: for a theory to be unitary, a scalar primary must have $\Delta \ge (d-2)/2$. For $\Delta  (d-2)/2$, the norm of some level-two state would become negative. A [free scalar field](@entry_id:148283), with $\Delta = (d-2)/2$, saturates this bound.

The requirement of non-negative norms for all states at all levels of the conformal tower leads to a set of **[unitarity bounds](@entry_id:150630)**. Some of the most important bounds are:
*   **Scalar operator ($\mathcal{O}$)**: $\Delta \ge (d-2)/2$. The lower bound is saturated by a [free scalar field](@entry_id:148283).
*   **Spinning operators**: The bounds depend on the spin. For a [conserved vector current](@entry_id:747721) (spin-1), $\Delta = d-1$. For the [stress-energy tensor](@entry_id:146544) (spin-2), $\Delta=d$.
*   **General representations**: For an operator transforming in a general representation $R$ of the [rotation group](@entry_id:204412) $SO(d)$, there is a bound for every way a descendant can be formed that transforms in a "smaller" representation $R^{(-)}$. A sophisticated method using the quadratic Casimir operators of $SO(d)$ provides the formula for these bounds [@problem_id:395989]. As an example, for an operator in the mixed-symmetry representation corresponding to the Young diagram $(2,1)$, the sharpest [unitarity](@entry_id:138773) bound is found to be $\Delta \ge d$.

These [unitarity bounds](@entry_id:150630) are a cornerstone of modern CFT research, particularly in the context of the [conformal bootstrap](@entry_id:153253), where they provide fundamental constraints on the space of possible consistent theories.
