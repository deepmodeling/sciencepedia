The Lagrangian density is given by\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\mu \\phi_a)(\\partial^\\mu \\phi_a) - \\frac{1}{2} m^2 (\\phi_a \\phi_a) - \\frac{\\lambda}{4! N} (\\phi_a \\phi_a)^2 $$\nwhere $\\phi_a$ are $N$ real scalar fields ($a=1, \\dots, N$), and summation over repeated indices is implied. The coupling constant $\\lambda$ is positive.\n\nThe system is prepared in the vacuum state of the symmetric phase, where the renormalized mass parameter is $m_i^2 > 0$. At time $t=0$, the system undergoes a quantum quench, where the mass parameter is instantaneously changed to a negative value, $m^2 = -m_0^2$, where $m_0$ is a positive, renormalized mass parameter. This quench renders the symmetric vacuum $\\langle \\phi_a \\rangle = 0$ unstable and triggers tachyonic growth of long-wavelength fluctuations, eventually leading to symmetry breaking.\n\nIn the large-N limit, the non-equilibrium dynamics of the system can be studied using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation, which becomes exact. The evolution of the field modes is governed by an effective time-dependent mass. For modes with momentum $k$, the instability is characterized by an exponential growth $e^{\\gamma_k t/2}$ of the mode amplitude, where $\\gamma_k$ is the Lyapunov exponent for that mode.\n\nDetermine the maximal Lyapunov exponent, $\\Gamma_{max} = \\max_k \\{\\gamma_k\\}$, associated with this tachyonic instability.", "solution": "**1. Equation of Motion in the Large-N Limit**\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the equation of motion for the field operator $\\phi_a(x)$ for $t>0$ is:\n$$ (\\partial^2 - m_0^2) \\phi_a(x) + \\frac{\\lambda}{6N} (\\phi_b(x) \\phi_b(x)) \\phi_a(x) = 0 $$\nIn the large-N limit, we can replace the quartic term by its mean-field value (Hartree-Fock approximation):\n$$ (\\phi_b \\phi_b) \\phi_a \\approx \\langle \\phi_b \\phi_b \\rangle \\phi_a $$\nWe define the time-dependent, spatially homogeneous condensate (or variance) as\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\frac{1}{N} \\langle \\phi_b(t,\\vec{x}) \\phi_b(t,\\vec{x}) \\rangle $$\nThe equation of motion then becomes a linear equation for the field operator:\n$$ (\\partial^2 - m_0^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{6} \\sigma(t)) \\phi_a(x) = 0 $$\nThis equation describes a free field with a time-dependent effective mass squared:\n$$ M^2(t) = -m_0^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{6} \\sigma(t) $$\n\n**2. Mode Function Dynamics**\n\nLet's work in momentum space. We can decompose the field operator into mode functions $f_k(t)$:\n$$ \\phi_a(t, \\vec{x}) = \\int \\frac{d^3 k}{(2\\pi)^3} \\left( \\hat{a}_{a,k} f_k(t) e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{x}} + \\hat{a}_{a,k}^\\dagger f_k^*(t) e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{x}} \\right) $$\nwhere $\\hat{a}_{a,k}$ and $\\hat{a}_{a,k}^\\dagger$ are the annihilation and creation operators of the initial state. The mode functions $f_k(t)$ (which are classical functions) satisfy the equation of motion:\n$$ \\frac{d^2}{dt^2} f_k(t) + (k^2 + M^2(t)) f_k(t) = 0 $$\nwhere $k=|\\vec{k}|$. Substituting the expression for $M^2(t)$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{d^2}{dt^2} f_k(t) + \\left(k^2 - m_0^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{6} \\sigma(t)\\right) f_k(t) = 0 $$\n\n**3. Initial Conditions and Renormalization**\n\nThe condensate $\\sigma(t)$ is given by the integral over the mode functions:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\int \\frac{d^3 k}{(2\\pi)^3} |f_k(t)|^2 $$\nThis integral is typically UV divergent. The divergence is associated with the vacuum energy and must be removed by renormalization. The physical quantity that drives the dynamics is the renormalized condensate, which corresponds to the change in the condensate with respect to its initial vacuum value. The system is prepared in the vacuum of the theory with $m^2=m_i^2 > 0$. Therefore, the renormalized condensate at the moment of the quench is zero:\n$$ \\sigma_{ren}(t=0) = 0 $$\nThe equation for the mode functions should correctly be written in terms of the renormalized mass $m_0$ and renormalized condensate $\\sigma_{ren}(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2}{dt^2} f_k(t) + \\left(k^2 - m_0^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{6} \\sigma_{ren}(t)\\right) f_k(t) = 0 $$\n\n**4. Lyapunov Exponent**\n\nA mode $k$ is unstable if its effective frequency squared is negative:\n$$ \\omega_k^2(t) = k^2 - m_0^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{6} \\sigma_{ren}(t) < 0 $$\nWhen this condition holds, the mode function $f_k(t)$ exhibits exponential growth. If we assume $\\omega_k^2(t)$ is approximately constant for a short duration, the solution is of the form $f_k(t) \\sim e^{\\sqrt{-\\omega_k^2(t)} t}$. The occupation number $|f_k(t)|^2$ grows like $e^{2\\sqrt{-\\omega_k^2(t)} t}$. The Lyapunov exponent for the mode $k$ at time $t$ is defined as this growth rate:\n$$ \\gamma_k(t) = 2\\sqrt{-\\omega_k^2(t)} = 2\\sqrt{m_0^2 - k^2 - \\frac{\\lambda}{6} \\sigma_{ren}(t)} $$\n\n**5. Maximizing the Lyapunov Exponent**\n\nThe problem asks for the maximal Lyapunov exponent, $\\Gamma_{max}$, which corresponds to the fastest possible growth rate during the instability. We need to maximize $\\gamma_k(t)$ with respect to both momentum $k$ and time $t$.\n$$ \\Gamma_{max} = \\max_{k, t} \\left[ 2\\sqrt{m_0^2 - k^2 - \\frac{\\lambda}{6} \\sigma_{ren}(t)} \\right] $$\nLet's analyze the expression inside the square root:\n*   **Dependence on $k$**: The term $-k^2$ means the expression is maximized for the lowest possible momentum, $k=0$.\n*   **Dependence on $t$**: The instability causes particles to be produced, so the renormalized condensate $\\sigma_{ren}(t)$ is a non-decreasing function of time, starting from $\\sigma_{ren}(0)=0$. The term $-\\frac{\\lambda}{6}\\sigma_{ren}(t)$ (with $\\lambda>0$) means the expression is maximized when $\\sigma_{ren}(t)$ is at its minimum. This occurs at $t=0$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the exponent is achieved at $k=0$ and $t=0$:\n$$ \\Gamma_{max} = \\gamma_{k=0}(t=0) = 2\\sqrt{m_0^2 - 0 - \\frac{\\lambda}{6} \\sigma_{ren}(0)} $$\nUsing the initial condition $\\sigma_{ren}(0)=0$, we get:\n$$ \\Gamma_{max} = 2\\sqrt{m_0^2} = 2m_0 $$\nThe maximal Lyapunov exponent is determined solely by the initial tachyonic mass scale $m_0$. The interaction term, proportional to $\\lambda$, only becomes effective as the condensate grows, which dampens and eventually shuts off the instability. The maximal growth rate occurs at the very onset of this process.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2m_0} $$", "id": "317794"}, {"introduction": "Not all non-equilibrium systems are transient; many are maintained in a stable configuration by constant fluxes of energy or particles from their environment, known as a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS).
