The derivation must proceed from first principles, starting with the counting of quantum states in wavevector space ($\\mathbf{k}$-space).\n\nFirst, we consider electrons confined to a cubic box of side length $L$ and volume $V = L^3$. The imposition of periodic boundary conditions, $\\psi(x+L, y, z) = \\psi(x, y, z)$ and similarly for the $y$ and $z$ directions, discretizes the allowed wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$. For a plane wave solution of the form $e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}$, the components of $\\mathbf{k}$ must satisfy:\n$$ k_x = \\frac{2\\pi n_x}{L}, \\quad k_y = \\frac{2\\pi n_y}{L}, \\quad k_z = \\frac{2\\pi n_z}{L} $$\nwhere $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are any integers. These allowed states form a cubic lattice in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. The volume in $\\mathbf{k}$-space occupied by a single orbital state is:\n$$ \\Delta V_k = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{V} $$\nFor a macroscopic system where $V$ is large, the discrete states in $\\mathbf{k}$-space are very dense, allowing us to treat the distribution of states as a continuum. The number of orbital states $dN_{orb}$ within an infinitesimal volume element $d^3k$ in $\\mathbf{k}$-space is given by the ratio of this volume to the volume per state:\n$$ dN_{orb} = \\frac{d^3k}{\\Delta V_k} = \\frac{V}{8\\pi^3} d^3k $$\nElectrons are spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ fermions. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, each orbital state, defined by a specific wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$, can accommodate two electrons: one with spin up and one with spin down. Thus, the total number of electron states $dN$ in the volume element $d^3k$ is twice the number of orbital states:\n$$ dN = 2 \\times dN_{orb} = 2 \\frac{V}{8\\pi^3} d^3k = \\frac{V}{4\\pi^3} d^3k $$\nThe problem asks for the density of states (DOS) as a function of energy, $g(\\epsilon)$. The energy of an electron is given by $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$, which depends only on the magnitude $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$. Therefore, it is convenient to consider spherical shells in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. The volume of a spherical shell of radius $k$ and thickness $dk$ is $4\\pi k^2 dk$. The number of states $dN$ within this shell is:\n$$ dN = \\frac{V}{4\\pi^3} (4\\pi k^2 dk) = \\frac{V k^2}{\\pi^2} dk $$\nThe DOS $g(\\epsilon)$ is defined such that $dN = g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon$. To find $g(\\epsilon)$, we perform a change of variables from $k$ to $\\epsilon$.

The number density $n_{3D}$ is constant with temperature.\nAt $T=0$, $\\mu(0) = \\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}}$, and the integral is simple:\n$$ n_{3D} = \\int_{0}^{\\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}}} C \\varepsilon^{1/2} d\\varepsilon = C \\left[\\frac{2}{3} \\varepsilon^{3/2}\\right]_{0}^{\\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{2}{3} C (\\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}})^{3/2} $$\nApplying the Sommerfeld expansion at $T > 0$:\n$$ n_{3D} \\approx \\int_{0}^{\\mu} C \\varepsilon^{1/2} d\\varepsilon + \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}(k_{B} T)^{2} \\left. \\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon}(C\\varepsilon^{1/2}) \\right|_{\\varepsilon=\\mu} $$\n$$ n_{3D} \\approx \\frac{2}{3} C \\mu^{3/2} + \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}(k_{B} T)^{2} \\left(C \\frac{1}{2} \\mu^{-1/2}\\right) $$\nSince $n_{3D}$ must be conserved, we equate the expressions for $T=0$ and $T>0$:\n$$ \\frac{2}{3} C (\\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}})^{3/2} \\approx \\frac{2}{3} C \\mu^{3/2} + \\frac{\\pi^2}{12} C (k_{B} T)^{2} \\mu^{-1/2} $$\nDividing by $\\frac{2}{3}C$:\n$$ (\\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}})^{3/2} \\approx \\mu^{3/2} + \\frac{\\pi^2}{8} (k_{B} T)^{2} \\mu^{-1/2} = \\mu^{3/2} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\pi^2}{8} \\frac{(k_{B} T)^{2}}{\\mu^2}\\right) $$\nTo find the correction, we can approximate $\\mu \\approx \\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}}$ in the small correction term:\n$$ (\\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}})^{3/2} \\approx \\mu^{3/2} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\pi^2}{8} \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)^2\\right) $$\nSolving for $\\mu$:\n$$ \\mu^{3/2} \\approx (\\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}})^{3/2} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\pi^2}{8} \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)^2\\right)^{-1} $$\n$$ \\mu \\approx \\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\pi^2}{8} \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)^2\\right)^{-2/3} $$\nUsing the binomial approximation $(1+x)^a \\approx 1+ax$ for small $x$:\n$$ \\mu(T) \\approx \\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}} \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{\\pi^2}{8} \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)^2\\right) = \\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\pi^2}{12} \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)^2\\right) $$\nThe leading low-temperature correction to the chemical potential is therefore:\n$$ \\delta\\mu(T) = \\mu(T) - \\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}} = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{12} \\frac{(k_{B} T)^2}{\\varepsilon_{F,3\\mathrm{D}}} $$\nThis correction term is proportional to $T^2$.\n\n### Qualitative Explanation of Temperature Dependence\n\nThe difference in the temperature dependence of the chemical potential between the 2D and 3D cases is a direct consequence of the energy dependence of their respective density of states functions.\n\nThe chemical potential $\\mu(T)$ must adjust with temperature to keep the total number of particles constant. As temperature increases, electrons are thermally excited from states below $\\mu$ to states above $\\mu$. The behavior of $\\mu(T)$ depends on the balance between the number of states available for these excited electrons and the number of states vacated by them (holes).\n\n*   **In 3D**, the DOS, $D_{3}(\\varepsilon) \\propto \\varepsilon^{1/2}$, is a monotonically increasing function of energy. This means that for any energy $\\Delta\\varepsilon$, there are more available states in the energy range $[\\mu, \\mu+\\Delta\\varepsilon]$ than in the range $[\\mu-\\Delta\\varepsilon, \\mu]$. Consequently, when electrons are thermally excited, they populate a region with a higher density of states than the region they vacate. To maintain a constant total particle number, the chemical potential must decrease with temperature. This shifts the Fermi-Dirac distribution to lower energies, reducing the overall particle count to compensate for the fact that excited particles occupy a denser state space. The Sommerfeld expansion shows this leads to a correction proportional to $T^2$ and the slope of the DOS at the Fermi energy, i.e., $\\delta\\mu \\propto -T^2 D'(\\varepsilon_F)/D(\\varepsilon_F)$.\n\n*   **In 2D**, the DOS, $D_{2}(\\varepsilon) = g_0$, is constant. The density of states is perfectly symmetric around any energy value. The number of states available for excited electrons in the energy range $[\\mu, \\mu+\\Delta\\varepsilon]$ is exactly equal to the number of states for holes in the range $[\\mu-\\Delta\\varepsilon, \\mu]$. This particle-hole symmetry holds. As a result, the thermal excitation of electrons is balanced, and to first order, there is no need for the chemical potential to shift to maintain particle number conservation. The $T^2$ term in the Sommerfeld expansion is proportional to $D'(\\varepsilon_F)$, which is zero for the constant 2D DOS. Higher-order effects lead to a much weaker, exponentially small correction. Our exact solution for 2D, $\\mu(T) = \\varepsilon_{F,2\\mathrm{D}} + k_B T \\ln(1 - \\exp(-\\varepsilon_{F,2\\mathrm{D}}/(k_B T)))$, has a low-temperature expansion $\\mu(T) \\approx \\varepsilon_{F,2\\mathrm{D}} - k_B T \\exp(-\\varepsilon_{F,2\\mathrm{D}}/(k_B T))$, showing exponentially suppressed temperature dependence, far weaker than the $T^2$ power law in 3D.\n\nIn summary, the decreasing chemical potential in 3D is a result of an increasing DOS with energy, while the nearly constant chemical potential in 2D is due to a constant DOS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{k_{B} T \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{n}{g_{0} k_{B} T}\\right) - 1\\right)}$$", "id": "2991509"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical predictions of the Sommerfeld model are most powerfully demonstrated when applied to measurable thermodynamic properties like heat capacity.
