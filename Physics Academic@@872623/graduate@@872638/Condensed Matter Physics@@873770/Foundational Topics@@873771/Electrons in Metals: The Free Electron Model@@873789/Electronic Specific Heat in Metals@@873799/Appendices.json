We can evaluate it using integration by parts.\nLet $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^4 \\exp(x)}{(\\exp(x) + 1)^2} dx$.\nLet $u = x^4$ and $dv = \\frac{\\exp(x)}{(\\exp(x)+1)^2} dx$. Then $du = 4x^3 dx$ and $v = -\\frac{1}{\\exp(x)+1}$.\n$$ I = \\left[-x^4 \\frac{1}{\\exp(x)+1}\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\exp(x)+1}\\right) (4x^3) dx $$\nThe boundary term is zero at both limits. Thus,\n$$ I = 4 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x)+1} dx $$\nThis integral is related to the Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$ through the relation:\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^{n-1}}{e^x+1} dx = (1-2^{1-n})\\Gamma(n)\\zeta(n) $$\nFor our integral, $n-1=3$, so $n=4$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x)+1} dx = (1-2^{1-4})\\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = \\left(1-\\frac{1}{8}\\right) (3!) \\zeta(4) = \\frac{7}{8} \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\zeta(4) = \\frac{21}{4}\\zeta(4) $$\nThe problem provides $\\zeta(4) = \\pi^4/90$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x)+1} dx = \\frac{21}{4} \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 3}{4} \\frac{\\pi^4}{30 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{7\\pi^4}{120} $$\nTherefore, the integral $I$ is:\n$$ I = 4 \\left(\\frac{7\\pi^4}{120}\\right) = \\frac{28\\pi^4}{120} = \\frac{7\\pi^4}{30} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $c_e$:\n$$ c_e = \\frac{g k_B^4 T^3}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar v_F)^3} \\left(\\frac{7\\pi^4}{30}\\right) $$\n$$ c_e = \\frac{7\\pi^2 g k_B^4}{30 (\\hbar v_F)^3} T^3 $$\nThis is the final expression for the electronic specific heat per unit volume. It is proportional to $T^3$, a characteristic feature of systems with a linear dispersion in three dimensions, distinguishing it from the $T^1$ dependence in conventional metals with a parabolic dispersion.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{7\\pi^2 g k_B^4}{30 (\\hbar v_F)^3} T^3} $$", "id": "2986220"}]}
