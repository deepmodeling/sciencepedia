The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It contains no flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full derivation and evaluation of options will be performed.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\nThe core a priori principle is the definition of a Bravais lattice: every lattice point is indistinguishable from every other. This means the environment, including the identity of any atom occupying the point, must be identical for all points in the lattice when viewed from any other lattice point. A crystal structure is formed by the convolution of a Bravais lattice with a basis:\n$$\n\\text{Crystal Structure} = \\text{Bravais Lattice} + \\text{Basis}\n$$\nThe CsCl structure consists of two interpenetrating cubic sublattices, one of Cs$^+$ ions and one of Cl$^-$ ions, shifted relative to each other by the vector $(\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\tfrac{1}{2}, \\tfrac{1}{2})$ in fractional coordinates of the conventional cubic cell of side length $a$. Let us place a Cs$^+$ ion at $(0,0,0)$ and a Cl$^-$ ion at $(\\tfrac{a}{2}, \\tfrac{a}{2}, \\tfrac{a}{2})$.\n\nHypothesis 1: The Bravais lattice is body-centered cubic (BCC).\nA BCC lattice has lattice points not only at integer coordinates $(n_1, n_2, n_3)a$ but also at half-integer coordinates $(n_1+\\tfrac{1}{2}, n_2+\\tfrac{1}{2}, n_3+\\tfrac{1}{2})a$. This means the positions $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ are both points of the *same* Bravais lattice. By definition, these points must be equivalent. However, in CsCl, one point is occupied by a Cs$^+$ ion and the other by a Cl$^-$ ion. Since these are different chemical species, the points are not equivalent. Therefore, the vector $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ cannot be a translation vector of the Bravais lattice, and the Bravais lattice cannot be BCC.\n\nHypothesis 2: The Bravais lattice is simple cubic (SC) with a basis.\nAn SC Bravais lattice consists of points at integer coordinates $(n_1, n_2, n_3)a$. The vector $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ is *not* a lattice translation. We can define a $2$-atom basis: {Cs$^+$ at $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0,0,0)$, Cl$^-$ at $\\mathbf{r}_2=(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$}. By placing this basis at every point of the SC lattice, we construct the full CsCl crystal structure. The set of Cs$^+$ positions is $\\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$ and the set of Cl$^-$ positions is $\\{\\mathbf{L} + (\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})\\}$, where $\\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$ are the SC lattice vectors. This correctly generates the CsCl structure.\n\nThis proves that the correct description of the CsCl structure is a simple cubic Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. By the definition of a Bravais lattice, all lattice points must be equivalent under pure translations. If the cesium chloride structure were a BCC Bravais lattice, the translation $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ would map a lattice point to an equivalent one and thus force the sites at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ to be chemically identical. Because these sites host distinct species, $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ cannot belong to the translation lattice, so the underlying Bravais lattice is simple cubic with a $2$-atom basis at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$.\nThis statement is a precise and accurate summary of the reasoning derived above. The argument hinges correctly on the non-equivalence of the Cs$^+$ and Cl$^-$ sites, which violates the definition of a Bravais lattice if the lattice were assumed to be BCC. The conclusion is also correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. The coordination number being $8$ excludes any body-centered cubic description, since a body-centered cubic Bravais lattice necessarily has coordination number $6$ like the rock salt structure.\nThis statement contains multiple factual errors. The coordination number (number of nearest neighbors) for an atom in the CsCl structure is indeed $8$. However, the coordination number for a point in a BCC Bravais lattice is also $8$ (the $8$ points at distances of $\\sqrt{3}a/2$). It is not $6$. The coordination number of the rock salt (NaCl) structure is $6$, but rock salt is based on a face-centered cubic (FCC) Bravais lattice, not BCC. The premise of the argument is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. Because the points at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ are both special Wyckoff positions of the primitive cubic space group $Pm\\overline{3}m$, they are related by a pure translation within that space group, which proves that the translation lattice is body-centered cubic.\nThe space group of CsCl is indeed $Pm\\overline{3}m$ (No. $221$), and the ion positions are the $1a$ Wyckoff site at $(0,0,0)$ and the $1b$ site at $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$. However, the statement that they are \"related by a pure translation within that space group\" is false. The set of pure translations constitutes the Bravais lattice. In a space group with the symbol $P$ (for primitive), there are no non-integer lattice translations like $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$. The inference that this \"proves\" a BCC lattice is a direct contradiction, as the 'P' in $Pm\\overline{3}m$ explicitly denotes a primitive, not body-centered ('I'), lattice. The statement is internally contradictory and factually flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. Attempting to model cesium chloride on a body-centered cubic Bravais lattice with a $2$-atom basis at $\\mathbf{0}$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ fails because $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ is itself a lattice translation of the body-centered cubic lattice. The generated set $\\{\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{0}\\}\\cup\\{\\mathbf{L}+(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})\\}$ equals the same lattice point set $\\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$, so every lattice site would be doubly occupied by two different species, which is unphysical. Therefore no two-species basis consistent with a body-centered cubic translation lattice reproduces cesium chloride.\nThis statement presents a rigorous proof by contradiction. Let the BCC lattice points be the set $\\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$. By definition, this set is invariant under translation by $\\mathbf{t}=(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$, i.e., $\\{\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{t}\\}=\\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$. If we attach a basis of species 1 at $\\mathbf{r}_1=\\mathbf{0}$ and species 2 at $\\mathbf{r}_2=(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$, the positions for species 1 would be $\\{\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{r}_1\\} = \\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$ and for species 2 would be $\\{\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{r}_2\\} = \\{\\mathbf{L}+(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} = \\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$. Thus, both species would occupy the exact same set of sites, which is a physical impossibility. The logic is sound and the conclusion is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nE. If the two species in cesium chloride were identical, the same set of geometric points would constitute a body-centered cubic Bravais lattice. The fact that the two sites are occupied by distinct species prevents $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ from being a translation of the Bravais lattice, so the correct classification is a primitive cubic Bravais lattice with a $2$-atom basis.\nThis statement uses a correct and insightful counterfactual. If both sites were occupied by the same atom type, every site would be equivalent, and the vector $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ would become a valid lattice translation, making the lattice BCC. It correctly identifies that the chemical difference between the species is the specific reason this translation is forbidden for the Bravais lattice of CsCl.

The basis vector positions $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{j}$ are given in fractional coordinates of the primitive cell vectors $(\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2, \\mathbf{a}_3)$.\nThe positions are:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{1} = 0\\,\\mathbf{a}_{1} + 0\\,\\mathbf{a}_{2} + 0\\,\\mathbf{a}_{3} = \\mathbf{0} $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathbf{a}_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathbf{a}_{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathbf{a}_{3} $$\nA general reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G}$ is expressed in terms of the reciprocal lattice primitive vectors and integer Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ as:\n$$ \\mathbf{G} = h\\,\\mathbf{b}_{1} + k\\,\\mathbf{b}_{2} + l\\,\\mathbf{b}_{3} $$\nWe now compute the dot product $\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{j}$ for each atom in the basis.\nFor the first atom ($j=1$):\n$$ \\mathbf{G} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{1} = \\mathbf{G} \\cdot \\mathbf{0} = 0 $$\nFor the second atom ($j=2$):\n$$ \\mathbf{G} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{2} = (h\\,\\mathbf{b}_{1} + k\\,\\mathbf{b}_{2} + l\\,\\mathbf{b}_{3}) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathbf{a}_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathbf{a}_{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathbf{a}_{3}\\right) $$\nExpanding the dot product and using the orthogonality relation $\\mathbf{a}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{j} = 2\\pi\\delta_{ij}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{G} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (h\\,\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{1} + k\\,\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{2} + l\\,\\mathbf{b}_{3}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{3}) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{G} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (h(2\\pi) + k(2\\pi) + l(2\\pi)) = \\pi(h+k+l) $$\nNow, we substitute these dot products into the definition of the structure factor:\n$$ S(\\mathbf{G}) = S(h,k,l) = f_{1}\\exp(-i \\cdot 0) + f_{2}\\exp(-i\\pi(h+k+l)) $$\n$$ S(h,k,l) = f_{1} + f_{2}\\exp(-i\\pi(h+k+l)) $$\nSince $h,k,l$ are integers, their sum $h+k+l$ is also an integer. We can use the property $\\exp(-i\\pi N) = (-1)^{N}$ for any integer $N$.\nThus, the expression can be written as:\n$$ S(h,k,l) = f_{1} + f_{2}(-1)^{h+k+l} $$\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation and Influence of the Motif**\n\nThe analysis must carefully distinguish between the geometric definition of the reciprocal lattice and the observable diffraction pattern.\n\n1.  **Reciprocal Lattice Type:** As established in Part 1, the reciprocal lattice is a geometric concept determined exclusively by the periodic translational symmetry of the Bravais lattice. For the given simple cubic Bravais lattice, the reciprocal lattice is, and remains, a simple cubic lattice. The presence of a motif (the basis atoms) does not alter the definition or the geometric type of the reciprocal lattice points $\\mathbf{G}$.\n\n2.  **Diffraction Selection Rules:** The intensity of a diffracted beam corresponding to a reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G}$ is proportional to the squared magnitude of the structure factor, $I(\\mathbf{G}) \\propto |S(\\mathbf{G})|^2$. The structure factor, which depends on the motif positions $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_j$ and form factors $f_j$, acts as a modulator of the diffraction intensity at each point of the reciprocal lattice. If $S(\\mathbf{G})=0$ for a particular $\\mathbf{G}$, the corresponding diffraction peak is absent. These conditions are known as extinction or selection rules.\n\nFrom the derived structure factor $S(h,k,l) = f_{1} + f_{2}(-1)^{h+k+l}$:\n-   If the sum of Miller indices $h+k+l$ is an **even** integer, then $(-1)^{h+k+l}=1$, and the structure factor is $S(h,k,l) = f_{1} + f_{2}$. The corresponding diffraction peaks are observed with an intensity proportional to $|f_{1} + f_{2}|^2$.\n-   If the sum of Miller indices $h+k+l$ is an **odd** integer, then $(-1)^{h+k+l}=-1$, and the structure factor is $S(h,k,l) = f_{1} - f_{2}$. The corresponding diffraction peaks have an intensity proportional to $|f_{1} - f_{2}|^2$.\n\nA critical special case arises if the two atoms in the motif are identical, meaning $f_{1}=f_{2}=f$. In this scenario:\n-   If $h+k+l$ is even, $S(h,k,l) = f+f = 2f$.\n-   If $h+k+l$ is odd, $S(h,k,l) = f-f = 0$.\n\nIn this specific case, all reciprocal lattice points $(h,k,l)$ for which the sum of indices is odd have zero intensity; they are systematically extinct. The original crystal structure—a simple cubic lattice with a two-atom basis at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$—is physically a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. The extinction rule $h+k+l=\\text{odd}$ systematically removes reflections, leaving only those for which $h+k+l=\\text{even}$. This is precisely the selection rule for a BCC lattice. The set of surviving reciprocal lattice points forms a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, which is the reciprocal of the BCC lattice.\n\nIn conclusion, the motif does not change the geometric type of the reciprocal lattice (which remains simple cubic), but it imposes selection rules via the structure factor that determine which of these geometric points will produce observable diffraction peaks. For the general case where $f_1 \\neq f_2$ (e.g., the CsCl structure), the odd-indexed reflections are weaker but not fully extinguished, and the underlying simple cubic symmetry of the reciprocal lattice is still observable, albeit with a systematic intensity modulation.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{f_{1} + f_{2}(-1)^{h+k+l}} $$", "id": "2971364"}]}
