## Introduction
The ordered, periodic arrangement of atoms is the defining characteristic of crystalline solids, giving rise to their unique and diverse properties. To move beyond this qualitative picture and build a quantitative understanding, it is essential to deconstruct this [periodicity](@entry_id:152486) into its fundamental components. The core of this deconstruction lies in the distinction between an abstract periodic framework—the lattice—and the physical object that is repeated—the basis, or motif. This article addresses the crucial concept of the basis, clarifying how this atomic arrangement is the true determinant of a material's physical character.

This article is structured to build a comprehensive understanding from the ground up. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, will formalize the distinction between the Bravais lattice and the basis, exploring the mathematical conventions for describing the motif and the profound role of symmetry. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will demonstrate the far-reaching consequences of the motif, showing how it governs diffraction patterns, [lattice vibrations](@entry_id:145169), and the electronic properties that define a material's function, with connections extending even to structural biology. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section offers a set of conceptual problems designed to solidify your grasp of how the motif shapes the structure and properties of real materials.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The introductory chapter established that a crystalline solid is fundamentally characterized by the periodic arrangement of its constituent atoms, ions, or molecules. This [periodicity](@entry_id:152486) is the defining feature from which a vast array of material properties emerges. To move from this general notion to a quantitative physical theory, we must deconstruct the concept of a "periodic arrangement" into its two essential components: an underlying mathematical scaffolding of [periodicity](@entry_id:152486), the **Bravais lattice**, and the physical object that is periodically repeated, the **basis** or **motif**. This chapter elucidates the principles governing these two components and explores the mechanisms by which their interplay determines the structure and properties of crystalline matter.

### The Fundamental Dichotomy: Lattice and Basis

A crystal structure can be formally understood as the mathematical convolution of a lattice and a basis. Let us define these concepts with precision.

A **Bravais lattice** is an infinite array of discrete points with an arrangement and orientation that appears exactly the same from whichever of the points the array is viewed. More formally, a Bravais lattice $L$ in $d$-dimensional space is a discrete additive subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^d$ of rank $d$. This means it can be generated by taking all integer [linear combinations](@entry_id:154743) of $d$ [linearly independent](@entry_id:148207) vectors, known as the **[primitive lattice vectors](@entry_id:270646)** $\{\mathbf{a}_1, \dots, \mathbf{a}_d\}$:
$$
L = \{ \mathbf{R} \mid \mathbf{R} = n_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \mathbf{a}_2 + \dots + n_d \mathbf{a}_d, \quad n_i \in \mathbb{Z} \}
$$
Physically, the Bravais lattice represents the complete set of translational symmetries of a crystal. If the crystal's atomic positions are represented by a set of points $S$, then for any lattice vector $\mathbf{R} \in L$, the crystal is invariant under translation by $\mathbf{R}$, i.e., $S + \mathbf{R} = S$ [@problem_id:2971344].

While the lattice provides the periodic framework, it does not, in general, specify the positions of the atoms themselves. For this, we need the **basis** (or **motif**), which is the set of one or more atoms, ions, or molecules, $B = \{\boldsymbol{\tau}_1, \boldsymbol{\tau}_2, \dots, \boldsymbol{\tau}_N\}$, whose positions are defined relative to a single lattice point. The basis must be fixed and identical at every lattice point to preserve the perfect [translational symmetry](@entry_id:171614) of the crystal. A hypothetical structure where the basis vectors $\boldsymbol{\tau}_j$ depend on the lattice vector $\mathbf{R}$ would break the strict [periodicity](@entry_id:152486) defined by the Bravais lattice.

The complete **crystal structure** is then generated by placing the basis at every point of the Bravais lattice. Set-theoretically, this is the Minkowski sum of the lattice point set $L$ and the [basis vector](@entry_id:199546) set $B$:
$$
S = L + B = \{ \mathbf{R} + \boldsymbol{\tau}_j \mid \mathbf{R} \in L, j = 1, \dots, N \}
$$
This fundamental construction, Crystal Structure = Bravais Lattice + Basis, is the cornerstone of [crystallography](@entry_id:140656) [@problem_id:2971344].

A crucial distinction arises from the size of the basis, $N$. If the basis consists of a single atom ($N=1$), then the atomic positions are identical to the lattice points. Such a structure is a direct physical realization of a Bravais lattice. If the basis contains more than one atom ($N > 1$), the atomic positions are not themselves a Bravais lattice, because the environment around each atom in the basis is not identical. For example, the vector connecting two atoms within a basis is not a translational symmetry of the crystal. Such structures are often referred to as non-Bravais lattices.

This distinction can be visualized by considering the microscopic atomic density, $\rho(\mathbf{r})$, which can be modeled as a sum of Dirac delta functions at each atomic site. For any crystal, this density function must have the [periodicity](@entry_id:152486) of the lattice: $\rho(\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{R}) = \rho(\mathbf{r})$ for all $\mathbf{R} \in L$. The key difference lies in the contents of a **[primitive cell](@entry_id:136497)**—a volume that tiles all of space when translated by the [lattice vectors](@entry_id:161583).
- For a crystal structure that is a **Bravais lattice**, the [primitive cell](@entry_id:136497) contains exactly one atom. The density function $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ has a single peak within the [primitive cell](@entry_id:136497).
- For a crystal with a multi-atom basis (**non-Bravais lattice structure**), the primitive cell contains $N > 1$ atoms. The density function $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ has $N$ distinct peaks within the primitive cell [@problem_id:2971394].

Formally, a point set $S$ can be described as a crystal structure (Lattice + Basis) if and only if there exists a Bravais lattice $L$ such that (i) $S$ is invariant under translations by $L$, and (ii) the number of points of $S$ within any primitive cell of $L$ is finite. This second condition is crucial and ensures the basis is finite [@problem_id:2971344].

### Representing the Motif: Coordinates and Conventions

To quantitatively describe a crystal structure, we must specify the positions of the basis atoms. These are typically given as **[fractional coordinates](@entry_id:203215)** $(u_j, v_j, w_j)$ relative to the [primitive lattice vectors](@entry_id:270646) $\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2, \mathbf{a}_3$. The [real-space](@entry_id:754128) position vector of a basis atom is then:
$$
\boldsymbol{\tau}_j = u_j \mathbf{a}_1 + v_j \mathbf{a}_2 + w_j \mathbf{a}_3
$$
The numbers $(u_j, v_j, w_j)$ are conventionally chosen to be in the interval $[0, 1)$, which physically places the atom within the parallelepiped defined by the [primitive vectors](@entry_id:142930) originating at the origin. However, the choice of representation for a motif is subject to several equivalences, a concept fundamental to understanding crystallographic descriptions.

The most important is the **equivalence of motif vectors modulo the lattice**. If we take a motif vector $\boldsymbol{\tau}_j$ and replace it with $\boldsymbol{\tau}'_j = \boldsymbol{\tau}_j + \mathbf{R}_k$ for some lattice vector $\mathbf{R}_k \in L$, the resulting crystal structure remains unchanged. This is because the set of points generated by the new [basis vector](@entry_id:199546), $\{\mathbf{R} + \boldsymbol{\tau}'_j \mid \mathbf{R} \in L\}$, is identical to the set $\{\mathbf{R}' + \boldsymbol{\tau}_j \mid \mathbf{R}' \in L\}$, since the sum of two [lattice vectors](@entry_id:161583) is just another lattice vector. This means that each basis vector is fundamentally an element of the [quotient space](@entry_id:148218) $\mathbb{R}^d/L$. This is why we can, without loss of generality, confine all [fractional coordinates](@entry_id:203215) to a single unit cell, typically $[0, 1)^d$ [@problem_id:2971340].

This equivalence has consequences for how we specify and interpret motif coordinates. For instance, the choice of origin for the coordinate system is a matter of convention. If we shift the origin of our coordinate system by a lattice vector $\mathbf{L} = m_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + m_2 \mathbf{a}_2 + m_3 \mathbf{a}_3$, the real-space position of every point $\mathbf{x}$ becomes $\mathbf{x}' = \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{L}$. The new vector representing the $j$-th basis atom becomes $\boldsymbol{\tau}'_j = \boldsymbol{\tau}_j - \mathbf{L}$. In [fractional coordinates](@entry_id:203215), this corresponds to the transformation $(u_j, v_j, w_j) \mapsto (u_j - m_1, v_j - m_2, w_j - m_3)$. While the raw coordinates change, their values modulo 1 are invariant, reflecting the physical invariance of the crystal under this shift [@problem_id:2971319].

The representation of the motif is also tied to the choice of [primitive lattice vectors](@entry_id:270646). The [primitive vectors](@entry_id:142930) themselves are not unique; for any given Bravais lattice, there are infinitely many valid sets of [primitive vectors](@entry_id:142930). If we choose a new primitive basis $\mathbf{A}' = (\mathbf{a}'_1\; \mathbf{a}'_2\; \mathbf{a}'_3)$ that is related to the old basis $\mathbf{A} = (\mathbf{a}_1\; \mathbf{a}_2\; \mathbf{a}_3)$ by a unimodular [integer matrix](@entry_id:151642) $\mathbf{M}$ (i.e., $\mathbf{A}' = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}$ with $\det(\mathbf{M}) = \pm 1$), the [fractional coordinates](@entry_id:203215) must transform to preserve the real-space positions of the atoms. An atom at [real-space](@entry_id:754128) position $\mathbf{r}$ is described by $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{A}\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{A}'\boldsymbol{\tau}'$. Substituting the [basis transformation](@entry_id:189626) gives $\mathbf{A}\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}\boldsymbol{\tau}'$, which implies the [fractional coordinates](@entry_id:203215) transform as $\boldsymbol{\tau}' = \mathbf{M}^{-1}\boldsymbol{\tau}$ [@problem_id:2971317].

Finally, it is important to recognize that the very decomposition of a periodic point set into a lattice and a basis may not be unique. Two different descriptions, $(\Lambda_1, \mathcal{M}_1)$ and $(\Lambda_2, \mathcal{M}_2)$, can generate the exact same set of points in space, $S_1 = S_2$. This is possible if and only if the two [lattices](@entry_id:265277) $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ are **commensurate**, meaning their intersection $\Lambda_c = \Lambda_1 \cap \Lambda_2$ is a sublattice of finite index in both. One can then reinterpret one structure in terms of the other's lattice. For example, a simple 2D square lattice, described as $(\Lambda_1, \mathcal{M}_1)$ with $\mathcal{M}_1 = \{\mathbf{0}\}$, can be equivalently described as a rectangular lattice $\Lambda_2$ with a two-point basis $\mathcal{M}_2 = \{\mathbf{0}, a\mathbf{e}_y\}$. This process involves expressing $\Lambda_1$ as a union of [cosets](@entry_id:147145) of $\Lambda_2$ and bundling the coset representatives with the original basis $\mathcal{M}_1$ to form the new basis $\mathcal{M}_2$ [@problem_id:2971379]. This freedom highlights that the "Bravais lattice" of a crystal is most precisely defined as the lattice of its full translational symmetry group, and any choice of a smaller (lower symmetry) sublattice necessitates a larger, more complex basis.

### The Role of Symmetry: From Motif to Asymmetric Unit

The translational symmetry of the Bravais lattice is often just a subgroup of the crystal's full symmetry group, known as the **space group**. Space groups include not only translations but also [point group](@entry_id:145002) operations like rotations, reflections, and inversions, as well as compound operations like glide reflections and screw rotations that combine a point operation with a fractional translation.

These additional symmetries impose powerful constraints on the motif. For a [space group](@entry_id:140010) operation $(R|\mathbf{t})$ (a point operation $R$ followed by a translation $\mathbf{t}$) to be a symmetry of the crystal, it must map the set of atomic positions onto itself. This means that for any atom in the motif at position $\boldsymbol{\tau}_j$, the transformed position $R\boldsymbol{\tau}_j + \mathbf{t}$ must be equivalent to the position of another atom, say $\boldsymbol{\tau}_{j'}$, in the motif, up to a lattice vector translation. That is, $R\boldsymbol{\tau}_j + \mathbf{t} = \boldsymbol{\tau}_{j'} + \mathbf{R}$ for some $\mathbf{R} \in L$. The operation thus induces a permutation of the atomic sites in the motif. If the atoms have different chemical species, the symmetry operation must also map an atom of a given species to a site occupied by an identical species [@problem_id:2971375].

This principle leads to a significant simplification in describing crystal structures. Instead of listing the coordinates of all atoms in the motif, we only need to specify the coordinates of a minimal set of representative atoms, known as the **asymmetric unit**. The entire motif (and thus the entire crystal) can then be generated by applying all the symmetry operations of the space group to the atoms in the asymmetric unit.

The formal framework for this concept involves **Wyckoff positions**. A Wyckoff position is the set of all points generated from a single representative point by the action of the space group operations. The number of equivalent points in the unit cell generated from a representative point $\mathbf{r}$ is called the [multiplicity](@entry_id:136466) of the Wyckoff position. This [multiplicity](@entry_id:136466) is determined by the point's own symmetry. The **[site-symmetry group](@entry_id:146984)** $H(\mathbf{r})$ is the subgroup of [space group](@entry_id:140010) operations that leave the point $\mathbf{r}$ invariant (up to a lattice vector). A point lying on a rotation axis or a mirror plane has a higher [site symmetry](@entry_id:183677) than a general point in the cell. By the [orbit-stabilizer theorem](@entry_id:145230) of group theory, the multiplicity of a Wyckoff position is given by the index of the [site-symmetry group](@entry_id:146984) in the point group of the crystal:
$$
\text{Multiplicity} = \frac{\text{Order of the Point Group}}{\text{Order of the Site-Symmetry Group}}
$$
For a general position not located on any symmetry element, the [site-symmetry group](@entry_id:146984) is trivial (contains only the identity), so its [multiplicity](@entry_id:136466) is equal to the full order of the point group [@problem_id:2971369].

### Physical Manifestations of the Motif

The abstract distinction between [lattice and basis](@entry_id:156406) is not merely a crystallographic formality; it has profound and directly observable consequences for the physical properties of materials, including their interaction with radiation and their electronic behavior.

#### Diffraction and Systematic Absences

When a wave (like X-rays or neutrons) scatters from a crystal, the total scattered amplitude in a particular direction, indexed by a [reciprocal lattice vector](@entry_id:276906) $\mathbf{G} = h\mathbf{b}_1 + k\mathbf{b}_2 + l\mathbf{b}_3$, is given by the **structure factor**, $S(hkl)$. The [structure factor](@entry_id:145214) is the sum of scattering contributions from all atoms within the basis, weighted by their phase factors:
$$
S(hkl) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} f_j \exp(-2\pi i (h x_j + k y_j + l z_j))
$$
where $f_j$ is the [atomic scattering factor](@entry_id:197944) for atom $j$ at [fractional coordinates](@entry_id:203215) $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$. While the positions of the Bragg peaks are determined by the Bravais lattice (via the reciprocal lattice), their intensities are modulated by $|S(hkl)|^2$, which depends critically on the arrangement of atoms in the basis.

Moreover, [non-symmorphic space group](@entry_id:143732) symmetries ([glide planes](@entry_id:182991) and screw axes), which inherently link point operations to fractional translations of the motif, impose strict conditions that cause [the structure factor](@entry_id:158623) to vanish for entire classes of reflections. These **[systematic absences](@entry_id:142990)** are a direct fingerprint of the underlying [space group symmetry](@entry_id:204211). For example, a crystal with a [glide plane](@entry_id:269412) defined by the operation $(x, y, z) \mapsto (-x, y + 1/2, z)$ will have [systematic absences](@entry_id:142990) for all $(0kl)$ reflections where $k$ is odd. This is because the contributions from a symmetry-related pair of atoms at $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$ and $(-x_j, y_j+1/2, z_j)$ will be exactly out of phase for these specific reflections, causing perfect cancellation for every pair in the basis, and thus a total intensity of zero [@problem_id:2971327].

#### Electronic Band Structure

The dichotomy between [lattice and basis](@entry_id:156406) is perhaps most elegantly expressed in the [electronic band structure](@entry_id:136694) of a solid. Bloch's theorem states that electron wavefunctions in a periodic potential can be labeled by a [crystal momentum](@entry_id:136369) vector $\mathbf{k}$, which is defined within a [reciprocal-space](@entry_id:754151) [primitive cell](@entry_id:136497) known as the **first Brillouin zone**. The distinct roles of the [lattice and basis](@entry_id:156406) are as follows:

1.  The **Bravais lattice** determines the [real-space](@entry_id:754128) [periodicity](@entry_id:152486). Its Fourier transform, the [reciprocal lattice](@entry_id:136718), defines the geometry—the shape and size—of the Brillouin zone. A larger [real-space](@entry_id:754128) primitive cell corresponds to a smaller Brillouin zone, and vice-versa.

2.  The **basis** determines the content *within* the Brillouin zone. The number of electronic states (or orbitals) in the basis determines the number of [energy bands](@entry_id:146576) in the [band structure](@entry_id:139379). A simple crystal with a one-atom basis will have one band (per atomic orbital considered), while a crystal with an $N$-atom basis will have $N$ bands. The interactions between these basis orbitals, such as different on-site energies and intra-cell hopping parameters, dictate how the bands hybridize, split, and form [energy gaps](@entry_id:149280) at different points $\mathbf{k}$ in the zone.

This separation of roles is powerfully illustrated by comparing different structures. Consider two crystals with the same Bravais lattice, one with a one-atom basis and one with a two-atom basis. They will share the exact same Brillouin zone. However, the first crystal will exhibit a single energy band, while the second will have two bands, which may be separated by a gap depending on the interactions between the two basis atoms. Now, consider a third crystal whose real-space [primitive cell](@entry_id:136497) is double the size of the first. Its Brillouin zone will be half the size. The single band of the first crystal will be "folded" back into this smaller zone, appearing as two bands. The motif adds internal degrees of freedom at a fixed $\mathbf{k}$, while the lattice defines the momentum space itself [@problem_id:2971389].

In summary, the concepts of [lattice and basis](@entry_id:156406) provide the fundamental language for describing crystalline order. Their properties, conventions, and symmetries dictate the arrangement of atoms in space, and this arrangement, in turn, governs the macroscopic physical properties that make crystalline materials so diverse and scientifically rich.
