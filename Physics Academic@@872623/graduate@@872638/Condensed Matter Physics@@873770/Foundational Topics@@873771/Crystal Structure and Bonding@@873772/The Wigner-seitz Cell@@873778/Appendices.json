The condition $a \\geq b$ is a valid constraint that ensures a well-defined ordering of nearest-neighbor distances. The tasks are clear, objective, and solvable.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe Wigner-Seitz cell centered at the origin is the set of all points $\\mathbf{r}=(x, y)$ that are closer to the origin than to any other lattice point $\\mathbf{R}_{m,n} = m\\mathbf{u} + n\\mathbf{v}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers, not both zero. The condition is $|\\mathbf{r}| \\leq |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_{m,n}|$ for all non-zero $\\mathbf{R}_{m,n}$. This inequality is equivalent to $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}_{m,n} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{R}_{m,n}|^2$. The boundaries of the Wigner-Seitz cell are the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors connecting the origin to the nearest lattice points.\n\nFirst, we must identify the shortest non-zero lattice vectors $\\mathbf{R}_{m,n} = (\\frac{a}{2}(m+n), \\frac{b}{2}(m-n))$. The squared length is $|\\mathbf{R}_{m,n}|^2 = \\frac{a^2}{4}(m+n)^2 + \\frac{b^2}{4}(m-n)^2$.\n\nLet's identify the shortest vectors:\n1.  For $(m,n) = (1,1)$ or $(-1,-1)$: $\\mathbf{R} = \\pm(a, 0)$. Squared length is $a^2$.\n2.  For $(m,n) = (1,-1)$ or $(-1,1)$: $\\mathbf{R} = \\pm(0, b)$. Squared length is $b^2$.\n3.  For $(m,n) = (1,0)$, $(-1,0)$, $(0,1)$, or $(0,-1)$: $\\mathbf{R} = (\\pm \\frac{a}{2}, \\pm \\frac{b}{2})$. Squared length is $\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{b^2}{4} = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$.\n\nGiven $a \\geq b > 0$, we compare the squared lengths:\n-   $b^2 \\leq a^2$.\n-   Comparing $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$ with $a^2$: $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4} \\leq a^2 \\iff a^2+b^2 \\leq 4a^2 \\iff b^2 \\leq 3a^2$. This is always true since $a \\geq b$.\n-   Comparing $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$ with $b^2$: $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4} \\leq b^2 \\iff a^2+b^2 \\leq 4b^2 \\iff a^2 \\leq 3b^2$. This is true if $a \\leq \\sqrt{3}b$.\n\nThis analysis indicates that the set of vectors defining the cell boundaries depends on the ratio $a/b$. However, the Wigner-Seitz cell is the intersection of all half-planes $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{R}|^2$. A side of the cell might be formed by a bisector of a vector that is not in the set of the absolute shortest vectors.\n\nThe boundary lines are given by the equations $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R} = \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{R}|^2$:\n1.  From $\\mathbf{R} = (\\pm a, 0)$: $\\pm ax = \\frac{1}{2}a^2 \\implies x = \\pm \\frac{a}{2}$.\n2.  From $\\mathbf{R} = (0, \\pm b)$: $\\pm by = \\frac{1}{2}b^2 \\implies y = \\pm \\frac{b}{2}$.\n3.  From $\\mathbf{R} = (\\pm \\frac{a}{2}, \\pm \\frac{b}{2})$: for $\\mathbf{R} = (\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2})$, the equation is $x\\frac{a}{2} + y\\frac{b}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{a^2}{4}+\\frac{b^2}{4}) = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{8}$. This simplifies to $ax+by = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$. By symmetry, we have four such lines: $ax \\pm by = \\pm\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$.\n\n#### Explanation for Non-Rectangular Shape\nA simple rectangular Wigner-Seitz cell would be defined solely by the planes $x=\\pm a/2$ and $y=\\pm b/2$. This would be the case for a simple rectangular lattice. However, for the centered rectangular lattice, we must also consider the constraints imposed by the lattice points at the center, which correspond to the lines $ax \\pm by = \\pm\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$.\n\nLet's test if a corner of the simple rectangle, for instance $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2})$, satisfies the inequality from the bisector of $\\mathbf{R}=(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2})$. The inequality is $ax+by \\leq \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$.\nSubstituting the point's coordinates: $a(\\frac{a}{2}) + b(\\frac{b}{2}) = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{2}$.\nThe inequality becomes $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{2} \\leq \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$, which simplifies to $2 \\leq 1$. This is false. Therefore, the corners of the rectangle defined by $x=\\pm a/2$ and $y=\\pm b/2$ are \"cut off\" by the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors pointing to the centers of the conventional cells. This truncation of the corners results in a polygonal shape that is not a simple rectangle. For $a>b$, it is a hexagon.\n\n#### Computation of the Hexagonal Cell Vertices\nFor $a>b$, the Wigner-Seitz cell is a hexagon. Its vertices are points that are equidistant from the origin and two other non-collinear lattice points. By symmetry, the vertices appear in sets.\nThe vertices of the hexagon are formed by the intersections of the boundary lines. Since $a \\geq b$, $b^2 \\leq a^2$, which implies that the lines $y=\\pm b/2$ form boundaries, while the lines $x=\\pm a/2$ might not. The vertices of the hexagon must lie within the strip $|x| \\le a/2$. The maximum x-coordinate of any vertex will be $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}$. Since $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a} \\leq \\frac{a}{2}$ (as $a^2+b^2 \\leq 2a^2 \\iff b^2 \\leq a^2$), the cell is always contained within the region $|x| \\leq a/2$. Thus, the lines $x=\\pm a/2$ do not form boundaries of the Wigner-Seitz cell for $a>b$. The boundaries are formed by $y = \\pm \\frac{b}{2}$ and $ax \\pm by = \\pm\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$.\n\nThe vertices are the intersections of these boundary lines.\n-   **Rightmost vertex:** This vertex lies on the $x$-axis $(y=0)$. It is equidistant from the origin and the two lattice points $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2})$ and $(\\frac{a}{2}, -\\frac{b}{2})$. Thus it is the intersection of the lines $ax+by = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$ and $ax-by = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$. Adding these equations gives $2ax = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{2}$, which yields $x = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}$. The vertex is $(\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}, 0)$.\n\n-   **Other vertices:** The remaining vertices are found by symmetry and by intersecting the other relevant boundary lines.\n    - The vertex in the first quadrant is equidistant from the origin, $(0,b)$, and $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2})$. It is the intersection of the bisector lines $y=\\frac{b}{2}$ and $ax+by = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$. Substituting $y=\\frac{b}{2}$ into the second equation: $ax + b(\\frac{b}{2}) = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4} \\implies ax = \\frac{a^2-b^2}{4} \\implies x = \\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}$. The vertex is $(\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, \\frac{b}{2})$.\n\nThe six vertices, ordered counterclockwise starting from the rightmost vertex on the $x$-axis, are:\n\n-   Vertex 1: $(\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}, 0)$\n-   Vertex 2: Intersection of $ax+by = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$ and $y=\\frac{b}{2}$, which is $(\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, \\frac{b}{2})$.\n-   Vertex 3: By symmetry across the $y$-axis from Vertex 2, $(-\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, \\frac{b}{2})$.\n-   Vertex 4: By symmetry across the origin from Vertex 1, $(-\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}, 0)$.\n-   Vertex 5: By symmetry across the origin from Vertex 2, $(-\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, -\\frac{b}{2})$.\n-   Vertex 6: By symmetry across the $x$-axis from Vertex 2, $(\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, -\\frac{b}{2})$.\n\nThe ordered list of coordinates $(x_1, y_1), \\dots, (x_6, y_6)$ is:\n1.  $(\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}, 0)$\n2.  $(\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, \\frac{b}{2})$\n3.  $(-\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, \\frac{b}{2})$\n4.  $(-\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}, 0)$\n5.  $(-\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, -\\frac{b}{2})$\n6.  $(\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, -\\frac{b}{2})$\nThis hexagonal shape is valid for $a>b$. In the special case $a=b$, the coordinates for vertices 2 and 3 become $(0, b/2)$, and vertices 5 and 6 become $(0, -b/2)$. The hexagon degenerates into a square with vertices on the axes, which is the correct Wigner-Seitz cell for a simple square lattice.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a} & 0 & \\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a} & \\frac{b}{2} & -\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a} & \\frac{b}{2} & -\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a} & 0 & -\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a} & -\\frac{b}{2} & \\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a} & -\\frac{b}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3020949"}]}
