We shall proceed by rigorously applying the definitions provided.\n\nA **Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$** is the set of all integer linear combinations of a basis of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. A set of three vectors $\\{\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2, \\mathbf{a}_3\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ forms a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^3$ if and only if they are linearly independent. This is equivalent to the condition that the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors is non-zero.\n\nA subset $L \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ is **discrete** if there exists a positive real number $\\varepsilon > 0$ such that for any two distinct points $\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in L$, the Euclidean distance $\\|\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}\\| \\ge \\varepsilon$. If the generating vectors of a lattice are linearly independent, the lattice is necessarily discrete. If they are linearly dependent, the discreteness must be investigated separately.\n\nWe analyze each case methodically.\n\n**Case 1: $L_1$ generated by $T_1 = \\{\\mathbf{a}_1=(1,0,0), \\mathbf{a}_2=(0,1,0), \\mathbf{a}_3=(0,0,1)\\}$**\n\nFirst, we test for linear independence of the generating vectors. We form a matrix $A_1$ with these vectors as rows:\n$$ A_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant is $\\det(A_1) = 1 \\neq 0$. The vectors are the standard basis vectors of $\\mathbb{R}^3$; they are linearly independent. Therefore, by definition, $L_1$ is a Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nSecond, we check for discreteness. A lattice generated by linearly independent vectors is always discrete. The minimum distance between distinct lattice points is the minimum length of a non-zero lattice vector $\\mathbf{v} = n_1\\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2\\mathbf{a}_2 + n_3\\mathbf{a}_3 = (n_1, n_2, n_3)$, where $n_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ are not all zero. The squared norm is $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = n_1^2 + n_2^2 + n_3^2$. Since $n_i$ are integers, the minimum non-zero value of this sum is $1$ (e.g., for $(n_1, n_2, n_3) = (1,0,0)$). The minimum distance is $\\sqrt{1}=1$. Thus, $L_1$ is discrete.\n\nConclusion for $L_1$: It is a discrete Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**Case 2: $L_2$ generated by $T_2 = \\{\\mathbf{a}_1=(1,0,0), \\mathbf{a}_2=(\\sqrt{2},0,0), \\mathbf{a}_3=(0,1,0)\\}$**\n\nFirst, linear independence. The vectors are $\\mathbf{a}_1 = (1,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{a}_2 = (\\sqrt{2},0,0)$, and $\\mathbf{a}_3 = (0,1,0)$. We can see that $\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\sqrt{2}\\mathbf{a}_1$, which is a linear dependency with a real coefficient. To check for linear dependence over $\\mathbb{R}$, we form the matrix $A_2$:\n$$ A_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant is $\\det(A_2) = 0$. The vectors are linearly dependent. They do not form a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, $L_2$ is not a Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nSecond, discreteness. A point in $L_2$ is of the form $\\mathbf{v} = n_1\\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2\\mathbf{a}_2 + n_3\\mathbf{a}_3 = (n_1 + n_2\\sqrt{2}, n_3, 0)$ for $n_1, n_2, n_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Consider the set of first components $\\{n_1 + n_2\\sqrt{2} : n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. It is a known result from number theory that this set, sometimes denoted $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}]$, is dense in the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. This means that for any real number $x$ and any $\\delta > 0$, there exist integers $n_1, n_2$ such that $|(n_1 + n_2\\sqrt{2}) - x| < \\delta$. In particular, we can find non-zero values of $n_1 + n_2\\sqrt{2}$ that are arbitrarily close to $0$.\nThis implies that for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, we can find a point $\\mathbf{v} = (n_1 + n_2\\sqrt{2}, 0, 0)$ in $L_2$ (with $n_3=0$ and not both $n_1,n_2$ zero) such that its distance to the origin, $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = |n_1 + n_2\\sqrt{2}|$, is less than $\\varepsilon$. Thus, there is no minimum non-zero distance between points in $L_2$.\n\nConclusion for $L_2$: It is not discrete, and it is not a Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**Case 3: $L_3$ generated by $T_3 = \\{\\mathbf{a}_1=(1,0,0), \\mathbf{a}_2=(1,\\sqrt{2},0), \\mathbf{a}_3=(0,0,\\sqrt{3})\\}$**\n\nFirst, linear independence. The matrix $A_3$ formed by these vectors is:\n$$ A_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & \\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sqrt{3} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant is $\\det(A_3) = 1(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{6} \\neq 0$. The vectors are linearly independent, so they form a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, $L_3$ is a Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nSecond, discreteness. As the generating vectors are linearly independent, the lattice $L_3$ must be discrete. The minimum distance is the square root of the minimum value of $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = \\|n_1\\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2\\mathbf{a}_2 + n_3\\mathbf{a}_3\\|^2$ for integers $n_1, n_2, n_3$ not all zero.\n$\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = \\|(n_1+n_2, n_2\\sqrt{2}, n_3\\sqrt{3})\\|^2 = (n_1+n_2)^2 + (n_2\\sqrt{2})^2 + (n_3\\sqrt{3})^2 = (n_1+n_2)^2 + 2n_2^2 + 3n_3^2$.\nThis expression is a sum of non-negative terms. Since $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are integers not all zero, the sum is a positive number. For instance, if $(n_1,n_2,n_3)=(1,0,0)$, $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2=1$. The minimum non-zero value is guaranteed to be greater than zero. Thus, the lattice is discrete.\n\nConclusion for $L_3$: It is a discrete Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**Case 4: $L_4$ generated by $T_4 = \\{\\mathbf{a}_1=(1,0,0), \\mathbf{a}_2=(0,1,0), \\mathbf{a}_3=(1,1,0)\\}$**\n\nFirst, linear independence. We observe that $\\mathbf{a}_3 = \\mathbf{a}_1 + \\mathbf{a}_2$. This is a linear dependency relation with integer coefficients. The matrix of vectors has a zero determinant, as all vectors lie in the $z=0$ plane. The vectors are linearly dependent and do not span $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, $L_4$ is not a Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nSecond, discreteness. A point in $L_4$ is $\\mathbf{v} = n_1\\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2\\mathbf{a}_2 + n_3\\mathbf{a}_3 = n_1(1,0,0) + n_2(0,1,0) + n_3(1,1,0) = (n_1+n_3, n_2+n_3, 0)$. Let $k_1 = n_1+n_3$ and $k_2 = n_2+n_3$. For any pair of integers $(k_1, k_2)$, we can find integers $n_1, n_2, n_3$ that produce them. For example, choose $n_3=0$, then $n_1=k_1$ and $n_2=k_2$. This demonstrates that the set $L_4$ is identical to the set of all points with integer coordinates in the $xy$-plane: $L_4 = \\{(k_1, k_2, 0) : k_1, k_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. This is a square lattice confined to a plane.\nThe distance between two distinct points $\\mathbf{v}_a=(k_{1a}, k_{2a}, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{v}_b=(k_{1b}, k_{2b}, 0)$ in $L_4$ is $\\|\\mathbf{v}_a - \\mathbf{v}_b\\| = \\sqrt{(k_{1a}-k_{1b})^2 + (k_{2a}-k_{2b})^2}$. As $k_{1a}, k_{1b}, k_{2a}, k_{2b}$ are integers, the differences are integers, not both zero. The minimal non-zero value for the sum of squares of two integers is $1^2+0^2=1$. Thus, the minimum distance is $\\sqrt{1}=1$. The lattice is discrete.\n\nConclusion for $L_4$: It is discrete, but it is not a Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\nWe summarize our findings:\n- $L_1$: Discrete Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n- $L_2$: Not discrete and not a Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n- $L_3$: Discrete Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n- $L_4$: Discrete, but not a Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given statements:\nA. **$L_1$ and $L_3$ are discrete Bravais lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^3$; $L_2$ is not discrete; $L_4$ is discrete but is not a Bravais lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.** This statement matches our analysis completely.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. **$L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$ are discrete Bravais lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^3$; $L_4$ is not discrete.** This is incorrect.

The matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is block upper-triangular with a $2\\times 2$ block in the $xy$-plane and a scalar $c$ along $z$.

Use the following foundational facts and definitions:\n- A Bravais lattice is generated by integer linear combinations of three linearly independent primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}_{1}$, $\\mathbf{a}_{2}$, and $\\mathbf{a}_{3}$, with primitive cell volume $V=\\mathbf{a}_{1}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a}_{2}\\times\\mathbf{a}_{3})$.\n- The reciprocal lattice is defined as the set of vectors $\\mathbf{G}$ such that $\\exp(i\\,\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{R})=1$ for all direct lattice vectors $\\mathbf{R}$. The primitive reciprocal vectors $\\mathbf{b}_{i}$ are defined by $\\mathbf{b}_{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{j}=2\\pi\\,\\delta_{ij}$.\n- The first Brillouin zone (BZ) is the Wigner–Seitz cell of the reciprocal lattice.\n\nTasks:\n1.

Provide the final answer as a single reduced fraction with no units. Do not round.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a specific ratio of the volumes of the first Brillouin zones (BZ) for the simple cubic (sc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and face-centered cubic (fcc) lattices. The calculation must be performed starting from the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nFirst, let us establish the relationship between the volume of the primitive cell in the direct lattice, $V_c$, and the volume of the first Brillouin zone, $V_{\\mathrm{BZ}}$. The first Brillouin zone is the Wigner-Seitz primitive cell of the reciprocal lattice. Its volume is therefore the volume of the primitive cell of the reciprocal lattice.\n\nThe primitive vectors of the direct lattice are $\\{\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2, \\mathbf{a}_3\\}$, and the volume of the primitive cell is $V_c = |\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{a}_2 \\times \\mathbf{a}_3)|$. The primitive vectors of the reciprocal lattice, $\\{\\mathbf{b}_1, \\mathbf{b}_2, \\mathbf{b}_3\\}$, are defined by the condition $\\mathbf{b}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_j = 2\\pi \\delta_{ij}$. From this definition, one can derive the explicit form of the reciprocal vectors:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_1 = 2\\pi \\frac{\\mathbf{a}_2 \\times \\mathbf{a}_3}{\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{a}_2 \\times \\mathbf{a}_3)}, \\quad \\mathbf{b}_2 = 2\\pi \\frac{\\mathbf{a}_3 \\times \\mathbf{a}_1}{\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{a}_2 \\times \\mathbf{a}_3)}, \\quad \\mathbf{b}_3 = 2\\pi \\frac{\\mathbf{a}_1 \\times \\mathbf{a}_2}{\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{a}_2 \\times \\mathbf{a}_3)}\n$$\nThe volume of the first Brillouin zone, $V_{\\mathrm{BZ}}$, is the volume of the primitive cell of the reciprocal lattice, given by $V_{\\mathrm{BZ}} = |\\mathbf{b}_1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{b}_2 \\times \\mathbf{b}_3)|$. Substituting the expressions for $\\mathbf{b}_i$:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{BZ}} = \\left| \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{V_c} (\\mathbf{a}_2 \\times \\mathbf{a}_3) \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{V_c} (\\mathbf{a}_3 \\times \\mathbf{a}_1) \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{V_c} (\\mathbf{a}_1 \\times \\mathbf{a}_2) \\right) \\right) \\right|\n$$\nUsing the vector identity $(\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times (\\mathbf{C} \\times \\mathbf{D}) = (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot (\\mathbf{C} \\times \\mathbf{D}))\\mathbf{B} - (\\mathbf{B} \\cdot (\\mathbf{C} \\times \\mathbf{D}))\\mathbf{A}$, we can simplify the cross product term:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{a}_3 \\times \\mathbf{a}_1) \\times (\\mathbf{a}_1 \\times \\mathbf{a}_2) = ((\\mathbf{a}_3 \\times \\mathbf{a}_1) \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_2) \\mathbf{a}_1 - ((\\mathbf{a}_3 \\times \\mathbf{a}_1) \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_1) \\mathbf{a}_2\n$$\nThe second term is zero because $\\mathbf{a}_3 \\times \\mathbf{a}_1$ is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{a}_1$. The scalar triple product in the first term is $(\\mathbf{a}_3 \\times \\mathbf{a}_1) \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_2 = \\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{a}_2 \\times \\mathbf{a}_3) = V_c$. Thus, the cross product simplifies to $V_c \\mathbf{a}_1$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $V_{\\mathrm{BZ}}$:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{BZ}} = \\left| \\frac{(2\\pi)^3}{V_c^3} (\\mathbf{a}_2 \\times \\mathbf{a}_3) \\cdot (V_c \\mathbf{a}_1) \\right| = \\frac{(2\\pi)^3}{V_c^2} |(\\mathbf{a}_2 \\times \\mathbf{a}_3) \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_1| = \\frac{(2\\pi)^3}{V_c^2} V_c = \\frac{(2\\pi)^3}{V_c}\n$$\nSo, for any Bravais lattice, the volume of the first Brillouin zone is inversely proportional to the volume of the direct space primitive cell. We will now compute these volumes for the sc, bcc, and fcc lattices. Let $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ be the Cartesian unit vectors.\n\nSimple Cubic (sc) Lattice:\nThe conventional cubic cell is also the primitive cell.\nPrimitive vectors:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_1^{\\mathrm{(sc)}} = a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}, \\quad \\mathbf{a}_2^{\\mathrm{(sc)}} = a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}, \\quad \\mathbf{a}_3^{\\mathrm{(sc)}} = a\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nVolume of the primitive cell:\n$$\nV_c^{\\mathrm{(sc)}} = |\\mathbf{a}_1^{\\mathrm{(sc)}} \\cdot (\\mathbf{a}_2^{\\mathrm{(sc)}} \\times \\mathbf{a}_3^{\\mathrm{(sc)}})| = |a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot (a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\times a\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})| = |a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot a^2\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}| = a^3\n$$\nThe reciprocal lattice vectors are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_1^{\\mathrm{(sc)}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}, \\quad \\mathbf{b}_2^{\\mathrm{ (sc)}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}, \\quad \\mathbf{b}_3^{\\mathrm{(sc)}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nThe reciprocal lattice is also simple cubic with lattice constant $2\\pi/a$. The nearest reciprocal lattice points are located at $(\\pm 2\\pi/a, 0, 0)$, $(0, \\pm 2\\pi/a, 0)$, and $(0, 0, \\pm 2\\pi/a)$.
