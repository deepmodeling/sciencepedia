The general solution for $\\psi_K(x)$ in the region $0 < x < L$ is:\n$$ \\psi_{K}(x) = A e^{k_0 x} + B e^{-k_0 x} $$\nFrom the first ODE, $\\psi_{K'}(x) = \\frac{i\\hbar v}{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{iv}}} \\frac{d\\psi_{K}}{dx} = \\frac{i}{k_0} (A k_0 e^{k_0 x} - B k_0 e^{-k_0 x}) = i(A e^{k_0 x} - B e^{-k_0 x})$.\n\nWe solve a scattering problem where a right-moving $K$-mode is incident from the left ($x<0$) and we seek the transmitted amplitude for this mode at the right ($x>L$).\nThe boundary conditions are:\nAt $x=0$: An incident $K$-mode of unit amplitude and a reflected $K'$-mode of amplitude $r$. The total wavefunction components are continuous.\n$$ \\psi_K(0) = 1, \\quad \\psi_{K'}(0) = r $$\nAt $x=L$: A transmitted $K$-mode of amplitude $t$ and no incident $K'$-mode from the right.\n$$ \\psi_K(L) = t, \\quad \\psi_{K'}(L) = 0 $$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions to the general solution:\nAt $x=L$:\n$$ t = A e^{k_0 L} + B e^{-k_0 L} $$\n$$ 0 = i(A e^{k_0 L} - B e^{-k_0 L}) \\implies A e^{k_0 L} = B e^{-k_0 L} \\implies B = A e^{2k_0 L} $$\nAt $x=0$:\n$$ 1 = \\psi_K(0) = A + B $$\nSubstituting for $B$:\n$$ 1 = A + A e^{2k_0 L} = A(1 + e^{2k_0 L}) \\implies A = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{2k_0 L}} $$\nThen $B = \\frac{e^{2k_0 L}}{1 + e^{2k_0 L}}$.\n\nNow we find the transmission amplitude $t$:\n$$ t = A e^{k_0 L} + B e^{-k_0 L} = \\frac{e^{k_0 L}}{1 + e^{2k_0 L}} + \\frac{e^{2k_0 L}}{1 + e^{2k_0 L}} e^{-k_0 L} = \\frac{2e^{k_0 L}}{1 + e^{2k_0 L}} $$\n$$ t = \\frac{2}{e^{-k_0 L} + e^{k_0 L}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{e^{k_0 L} + e^{-k_0 L}}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(k_0 L)} $$\nThe transmission probability for one edge is $T_{\\text{edge}} = |t|^2$:\n$$ T_{\\text{edge}} = \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(k_0 L)} = \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{iv}}L}{\\hbar v}\\right)} $$\nThe total conductance is due to two identical, independent edges:\n$$ G_{\\text{armchair}}(L) = \\frac{2e^2}{h} T_{\\text{edge}} = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{iv}}L}{\\hbar v}\\right)} $$\nIn units of $e^2/h$, the conductance is $\\frac{2}{\\cosh^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{iv}}L}{\\hbar v}\\right)}$.\n\nCombining the results for the two cases, we form the requested row vector. The entries are the conductance values in units of $e^2/h$.\n$$ G_{\\text{zigzag}} / (e^2/h) = 2 $$\n$$ G_{\\text{armchair}}(L) / (e^2/h) = \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{iv}}L}{\\hbar v}\\right)} $$\nThe final answer is $[2, \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{iv}}L}{\\hbar v}\\right)}]$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{iv}}L}{\\hbar v}\\right)} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3023664"}]}
