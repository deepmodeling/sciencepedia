## Introduction
In the quantum world of crystalline solids, electrons possess intrinsic properties beyond charge and mass that dictate their behavior. While [electron spin](@entry_id:137016) is a familiar quantum degree of freedom, another powerful, material-dependent property exists: the valley index. In many important semiconductors, the lowest-energy states for electrons reside in several distinct, symmetrically-related "valleys" in the material's [band structure](@entry_id:139379). This [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) acts as a new flavor, or [pseudospin](@entry_id:147053), that can be manipulated and controlled. However, the stability of this valley information is fundamentally challenged by scattering processes that can transfer an electron from one valley to another. Understanding the origin of [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) and the mechanisms of [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) is therefore critical to both fundamental condensed matter physics and the development of next-generation electronic and quantum technologies.

This article addresses the core principles governing this valley degree of freedom. It aims to bridge the gap between the abstract concept of [band structure symmetry](@entry_id:139158) and the tangible, measurable effects that valleys have on material properties. Throughout the following chapters, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of this rich topic. The first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** will lay the theoretical groundwork, explaining how crystal symmetries give rise to [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) and how scattering by defects and phonons can mix these valley states. The second chapter, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections,"** will explore the profound consequences of these principles, showing how valley physics impacts everything from thermoelectric efficiency and [quantum transport](@entry_id:138932) to the design of valleytronic devices and silicon qubits. Finally, **"Hands-On Practices"** will allow you to solidify your knowledge by working through practical calculations related to effective mass, [scattering rates](@entry_id:143589), and experimental signatures, cementing the link between theory and observation.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Origin and Nature of Valley Degeneracy

In the quantum theory of [crystalline solids](@entry_id:140223), the energy eigenstates for electrons, known as Bloch states, are labeled by a crystal momentum vector $\mathbf{k}$ that resides within a primitive cell of the reciprocal lattice, the first Brillouin zone. The [energy dispersion relation](@entry_id:145014), or [band structure](@entry_id:139379) $E_n(\mathbf{k})$, describes the energy of an electron in band $n$ as a function of its [crystal momentum](@entry_id:136369). The low-energy physics governing electronic transport and optical properties is often dominated by the behavior of electrons near the local minima of the conduction band or the local maxima of the valence band. These band [extrema](@entry_id:271659) are referred to as **valleys**.

**Valley degeneracy**, denoted by the symbol $g_v$, refers to the existence of multiple, energetically equivalent valleys located at distinct and inequivalent points in the Brillouin zone. The fundamental origin of this degeneracy lies in the spatial symmetries of the crystal lattice. A crystal is characterized by a **[point group](@entry_id:145002)** $P$, which is the set of rotation and reflection operations that leave the crystal structure invariant. The Hamiltonian of an electron in the crystal must be invariant under these symmetry operations. This symmetry imposes a powerful constraint on the band structure: for any point group operation $g \in P$, the energy at wavevector $\mathbf{k}$ must be identical to the energy at the transformed [wavevector](@entry_id:178620) $g\mathbf{k}$ [@problem_id:3023601]. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$
E_n(g\mathbf{k}) = E_n(\mathbf{k})
$$

If a band minimum occurs at a generic wavevector $\mathbf{k}_0$ (one not left invariant by any symmetry operation other than the identity), then applying all the operations of the point group $P$ to $\mathbf{k}_0$ will generate a set of distinct wavevectors, $\{g\mathbf{k}_0 | g \in P\}$, all of which must host energy minima with the exact same energy. This set of symmetry-related wavevectors is known as the **star of** $\mathbf{k}_0$. The number of distinct points in the star of $\mathbf{k}_0$ (after accounting for equivalences due to translations by a [reciprocal lattice vector](@entry_id:276906) $\mathbf{G}$) determines the [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) $g_v$ [@problem_id:3023587].

In addition to point group symmetries, **[time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094) (TRS)** plays a crucial role. In the absence of magnetic fields or [magnetic order](@entry_id:161845), TRS requires that the [energy spectrum](@entry_id:181780) be symmetric with respect to momentum inversion:

$$
E_n(-\mathbf{k}) = E_n(\mathbf{k})
$$

This means that for every valley at $\mathbf{k}_0$, there must be an energetically degenerate valley at $-\mathbf{k}_0$. If $-\mathbf{k}_0$ is not already part of the star of $\mathbf{k}_0$ generated by the point group, then TRS effectively doubles the number of degenerate valleys [@problem_id:3023601].

It is essential to distinguish [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) from **spin degeneracy**. Valley degeneracy is a relationship between states at *different* crystal momenta ($\mathbf{k}_1, \mathbf{k}_2, \dots$) that are related by spatial symmetries. Spin degeneracy, on the other hand, typically refers to a [multiplicity of states](@entry_id:158869) at the *same* crystal momentum $\mathbf{k}$. For example, in a crystal with both TRS and spatial [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948), every energy band is at least twofold degenerate at every $\mathbf{k}$ point, a spin degeneracy that persists even in the presence of strong [spin-orbit coupling](@entry_id:143520). This spin degeneracy, $g_s$, is conceptually distinct from the [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) $g_v$ [@problem_id:3023548]. When counting the total number of available low-energy states for calculating quantities like the density of states, these factors multiply, yielding a total degeneracy of $g_{total} = g_v \times g_s$.

### Case Studies in Valley Degeneracy

The principles of [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) are best understood through concrete examples.

**Bulk Silicon (Si):** Silicon, a three-dimensional crystal with a [diamond cubic structure](@entry_id:159542), provides a classic example. Its conduction band does not have its minimum at the center of the Brillouin zone ($\Gamma$ point). Instead, the minima are located along the six equivalent $\langle 100 \rangle$ directions (the $\Delta$ lines), at wavevectors $\mathbf{k} \approx (0.85) \frac{2\pi}{a} \hat{\mathbf{u}}$, where $a$ is the [lattice constant](@entry_id:158935) and $\hat{\mathbf{u}}$ is a unit vector along one of the $\pm x, \pm y, \pm z$ axes. These six locations are related to each other by the operations of the cubic point group, forming a star of $\mathbf{k}$. Since these six points are inequivalent within the first Brillouin zone, bulk silicon has a [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) of $g_v=6$. Including the twofold spin degeneracy ($g_s=2$), the total degeneracy for low-energy electrons in the conduction band is $g_v g_s = 12$ [@problem_id:3023548], [@problem_id:3023587].

**Monolayer Graphene:** Graphene, a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms, has a hexagonal Brillouin zone. Its remarkable electronic properties originate from valleys located at the six corners of this hexagon. However, these six corners are not all inequivalent; they can be grouped into two sets of three, with the corners within each set being connected by a [reciprocal lattice vector](@entry_id:276906). Thus, there are only two distinct valleys, conventionally labeled $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K}'$. These two valleys are related by time-reversal symmetry, as $\mathbf{K}' = -\mathbf{K}$ (modulo a reciprocal lattice vector). TRS guarantees that the energy minima at $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K}'$ are degenerate. Therefore, graphene has a [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) of $g_v=2$ [@problem_id:3023548].

**Monolayer Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS₂):** Like graphene, monolayer MoS₂ is a 2D material with a hexagonal lattice, and its band extrema also occur at the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K}'$ points, giving $g_v=2$. The degeneracy between the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K}'$ valleys is again protected by TRS. A key difference from graphene is that MoS₂ lacks inversion symmetry. While this does not lift the [energy degeneracy](@entry_id:203091) between the valley minima, it does lead to other important valley-contrasting properties, such as spin-valley locking, when [spin-orbit coupling](@entry_id:143520) is considered [@problem_id:3023587], [@problem_id:3023601].

These examples demonstrate that the value of $g_v$ is determined not by dimensionality alone, but by the specific interplay of the crystal's [point group symmetry](@entry_id:141230) and the geometry of its Brillouin zone [@problem_id:3023587].

### Lifting Valley Degeneracy

The ability to control and lift [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) is the central goal of **[valleytronics](@entry_id:139774)**. Degeneracy can be lifted by applying an external perturbation that breaks the symmetries protecting it.

A primary protecting symmetry is TRS. An external **magnetic field** $\mathbf{B}$ breaks TRS. In materials with a valley-contrasting [orbital magnetic moment](@entry_id:159585) $\mathbf{m}_n(\mathbf{k})$ (which is non-zero in systems lacking [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948), like MoS₂ or gapped graphene), the magnetic field introduces a valley-dependent energy shift, $\Delta E = -\mathbf{m}_n(\mathbf{k}) \cdot \mathbf{B}$. Since the orbital moment is odd under time reversal, $\mathbf{m}_n(\mathbf{K}) = -\mathbf{m}_n(\mathbf{K}')$, the two valleys experience opposite energy shifts, lifting the degeneracy. This is often called the **valley Zeeman effect** [@problem_id:3023597].

Alternatively, one can break the spatial symmetries of the point group. For example, applying a **uniaxial strain** to cubic silicon along the $[001]$ direction lowers the crystal symmetry from cubic to tetragonal. The cubic [symmetry operations](@entry_id:143398) that previously related the $x, y,$ and $z$ axes are no longer present. Consequently, the two valleys along the strain axis ($k_z$ axis) are no longer energetically equivalent to the four valleys in the perpendicular plane ($k_x-k_y$ plane). The original $6$-fold degeneracy is lifted, splitting into a $2$-fold and a $4$-fold degenerate set [@problem_id:3023548], [@problem_id:3023601].

It is crucial to note that not every perturbation that breaks a symmetry will lift [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132). For instance, a staggered sublattice potential in graphene breaks inversion symmetry but preserves TRS. As TRS is the symmetry relating the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K}'$ valleys, their degeneracy remains intact [@problem_id:3023597].

### Physical Manifestations of Valley Degeneracy

Valley degeneracy is not merely a theoretical curiosity; it has profound and measurable consequences. In equilibrium thermodynamics, the valleys act as independent channels for electrons. The total **density of states**, $D(E)$, is the sum of the contributions from each valley: $D(E) = g_v D_1(E)$, where $D_1(E)$ is the density of states for a single valley. Consequently, extensive thermodynamic quantities such as the total particle number, internal energy, and entropy are, at a fixed chemical potential and temperature, multiplied by the [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) factor $g_v$ [@problem_id:3023545].

In the language of **[valleytronics](@entry_id:139774)**, the valley index can be treated as a discrete degree of freedom, analogous to [electron spin](@entry_id:137016). For a two-valley system like graphene, this gives rise to the concept of **valley [pseudospin](@entry_id:147053)**. A state in the $\mathbf{K}$ valley can be assigned a [pseudospin](@entry_id:147053) value of $\tau_z = +1$, and a state in the $\mathbf{K}'$ valley a value of $\tau_z = -1$ [@problem_id:3023573]. "Valley [pseudospin](@entry_id:147053) conservation" is then equivalent to the absence of scattering between the two valleys.

### Intervalley Scattering: The Mechanism of Valley Mixing

**Intervalley scattering** is any process that transfers a charge carrier from one valley to another. Such processes are fundamental because they determine the lifetime of the valley [pseudospin](@entry_id:147053) and mediate the crossover between different physical regimes.

#### The Momentum Conservation Hurdle

The essential physics of [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) is governed by the law of [crystal momentum conservation](@entry_id:145588). To scatter an electron from an initial state $\mathbf{k}_i$ in one valley to a final state $\mathbf{k}_f$ in another, the scattering agent must provide the necessary momentum change, $\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{k}_f - \mathbf{k}_i$, up to a [reciprocal lattice vector](@entry_id:276906) $\mathbf{G}$. Since valleys are, by definition, well-separated in the Brillouin zone, the intervalley vector $\mathbf{k}_f - \mathbf{k}_i$ is large—typically on the order of the inverse lattice constant, $1/a$.

For graphene, a direct calculation shows that the magnitude of the vector connecting the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K}'$ points is $|\mathbf{K}-\mathbf{K}'| = \frac{4\pi}{3a}$, a significant fraction of the size of the Brillouin zone itself [@problem_id:3023578]. For silicon, scattering between opposite valleys on the same axis (a "$g$-process") requires a [momentum transfer](@entry_id:147714) of magnitude $\approx 1.7 \frac{2\pi}{a}$ (an Umklapp process), while scattering between valleys on orthogonal axes (an "$f$-process") requires momentum transfer of magnitude $\approx 1.2 \frac{2\pi}{a}$ [@problem_id:3023532]. This "momentum hurdle" is the key determinant of what types of imperfections can cause [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281).

#### Scattering by Potentials: The Role of Spatial Range

The ability of a [static disorder](@entry_id:144184) potential $U(\mathbf{r})$ to provide a momentum transfer $\mathbf{q}$ is determined by the strength of its Fourier component $\tilde{U}(\mathbf{q})$. The [scattering matrix](@entry_id:137017) element is directly proportional to $\tilde{U}(\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{k}_f - \mathbf{k}_i - \mathbf{G})$ [@problem_id:3023580]. A fundamental property of Fourier transforms dictates a reciprocal relationship between the spatial range of a potential and the width of its momentum spectrum:

- **Long-Range Potentials:** A potential that is smooth and varies slowly in real space over a characteristic length $\xi \gg a$ (e.g., from distant, screened charged impurities) has a Fourier spectrum that is sharply peaked at $\mathbf{q}=0$ and decays rapidly for $|\mathbf{q}| > 1/\xi$. Since [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) requires large $\mathbf{q} \sim 1/a$, the Fourier components of smooth potentials at these momenta are negligible. Therefore, **long-range disorder primarily causes intravalley scattering** (small momentum transfers within a single valley) and is ineffective at mixing valleys [@problem_id:3023580], [@problem_id:3023573].

- **Short-Range Potentials:** A potential that is atomically sharp and localized in real space with $\xi \sim a$ (e.g., a point defect, a vacancy, or a [substitutional impurity](@entry_id:268460)) has a Fourier spectrum that is very broad in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). A [delta-function potential](@entry_id:189699), $U(\mathbf{r}) = U_0 \delta(\mathbf{r})$, has a completely flat Fourier spectrum, $\tilde{U}(\mathbf{q}) = U_0$. Such potentials have significant Fourier weight at all momenta, including the large momenta required to connect different valleys. Consequently, **atomically sharp disorder is the primary source of elastic [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281)** [@problem_id:3023580], [@problem_id:3023548].

#### Scattering by Phonons: The Role of Zone-Edge Modes

Similar to static potentials, phonons ([quantized lattice vibrations](@entry_id:142863)) can also scatter electrons between valleys. The [momentum conservation](@entry_id:149964) law for [electron-phonon scattering](@entry_id:138098) is $\mathbf{k}_f = \mathbf{k}_i \pm \mathbf{q}_{ph} + \mathbf{G}$, where $\mathbf{q}_{ph}$ is the [phonon momentum](@entry_id:202970). To bridge the large momentum gap between valleys, a large-momentum phonon is required. Phonons near the center of the Brillouin zone ($\Gamma$ point), which correspond to long-wavelength acoustic vibrations, have $|\mathbf{q}_{ph}| \to 0$ and cannot cause [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281). The necessary large momentum must be supplied by **zone-edge phonons**, which have wavelengths comparable to the [lattice spacing](@entry_id:180328) [@problem_id:3023532].

In silicon, specific optical and [acoustic phonons](@entry_id:141298) near the $X$ and $L$ points of the Brillouin zone boundary have the correct momenta and symmetries to mediate the various $g$- and $f$-type intervalley processes. In graphene, [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) is predominantly mediated by [optical phonons](@entry_id:136993) near the $\mathbf{K}$ point of the [phonon dispersion](@entry_id:142059), which possess the right momentum (via an Umklapp process) and symmetry to couple the electronic $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K}'$ valleys [@problem_id:3023532].

The strength of this coupling is described by **[deformation potential theory](@entry_id:140142)**. For zero-order intervalley coupling, the squared matrix element for the process is given by:

$$
|M_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}'}|^2 = D_{iv}^2 \frac{\hbar}{2\rho V \omega_{\mathbf{q}\nu}}
$$

Here, $D_{iv}$ is the intervalley [deformation potential](@entry_id:748275) constant, a parameter with units of energy per unit displacement that quantifies the intrinsic [coupling strength](@entry_id:275517) for a specific phonon mode. The expression also shows that the coupling is inversely proportional to the crystal mass density $\rho$ and the phonon frequency $\omega_{\mathbf{q}\nu}$, reflecting that for a given phonon energy, a heavier lattice or higher frequency mode has smaller displacement amplitude [@problem_id:3023539].

### Intervalley Scattering and Quantum Transport: A Case Study in Graphene

The presence or absence of [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) can have dramatic and observable effects on quantum transport phenomena. A prime example is the magnetoconductivity of graphene at low temperatures, which is governed by the principles of **weak localization (WL)** and **[weak antilocalization](@entry_id:144949) (WAL)**. These phenomena arise from the quantum interference between a charge carrier's trajectory and its time-reversed counterpart as it diffuses through the material.

The system's behavior is categorized into different **[symmetry classes](@entry_id:137548)**. Systems with TRS and no other special properties belong to the **orthogonal class (AI)**, which exhibits constructive interference of backscattering paths, leading to WL and a positive magnetoconductivity correction ($\Delta\sigma(B) > 0$). Systems with an effective TRS operator that squares to $-1$ belong to the **symplectic class (AII)**, which exhibits destructive interference, leading to WAL and a negative magnetoconductivity correction ($\Delta\sigma(B)  0$).

In graphene, the [pseudospin](@entry_id:147053)-momentum locking of carriers within a single valley imparts a geometric **Berry phase** of $\pi$ for any closed-loop backscattering path. This extra phase factor of $e^{i\pi}=-1$ flips the interference from constructive to destructive, placing pristine graphene (with only intravalley scattering) into the symplectic class (AII). It therefore exhibits **[weak antilocalization](@entry_id:144949)** [@problem_id:3023571].

Intervalley scattering fundamentally alters this picture. The crossover is controlled by the ratio of the [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) time, $\tau_{iv}$, to the [phase coherence](@entry_id:142586) time, $\tau_{\phi}$.

- **Clean Limit ($\tau_{iv} \gg \tau_{\phi}$):** When [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) is rare, an electron diffuses and interferes with its time-reversed path entirely within a single valley before losing [phase coherence](@entry_id:142586). The $\pi$ Berry phase remains effective, destructive interference dominates, and the system shows WAL.

- **Dirty Limit ($\tau_{iv} \ll \tau_{\phi}$):** When [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) is frequent, an electron scatters between the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K}'$ valleys many times within its [phase coherence](@entry_id:142586) time. The Berry phase in the $\mathbf{K}'$ valley is opposite to that in the $\mathbf{K}$ valley. The rapid switching between valleys averages out the Berry phase effect. The special intravalley symmetry is broken, and the system's behavior is governed only by the global TRS. Graphene reverts to the standard orthogonal class (AI) and exhibits **weak localization**.

This remarkable crossover from [weak antilocalization](@entry_id:144949) to weak localization, driven by the onset of [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281), provides a powerful experimental signature for probing the nature of disorder and the lifetime of the valley degree of freedom in low-dimensional materials [@problem_id:3023571].
