## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The principles of [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) and [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281), while rooted in the fundamental quantum mechanics of crystalline solids, have profound and far-reaching consequences across a multitude of scientific and engineering disciplines. Moving beyond the foundational mechanisms, this chapter explores how these concepts are applied to understand and engineer the behavior of materials and devices. We will see that [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) is not merely a multiplicative factor for [electronic states](@entry_id:171776) but a rich internal degree of freedom that can be harnessed for new technologies. Furthermore, [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) is not just another relaxation mechanism but a process whose presence or absence critically determines the observable physics in systems ranging from [thermoelectric generators](@entry_id:156128) to [topological insulators](@entry_id:137834) and quantum computers.

### Electronic Transport and Quantum Phenomena

The most direct consequences of [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) are found in the transport properties of metals and semiconductors. From the quantization of conductance in ballistic nanowires to the thermoelectric efficiency of bulk materials, the presence of multiple valleys leaves an indelible fingerprint.

#### Quantum Conductance and Macroscopic Conductivity

In the realm of [mesoscopic physics](@entry_id:138415), where transport is ballistic and phase-coherent, the Landauer-Büttiker formalism reveals the fundamental contribution of valleys to electrical conductance. For a quasi-one-dimensional conductor, each transverse mode acts as an independent channel for electron flow. If the material possesses a spin degeneracy $g_s$ and a [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) $g_v$, and these degeneracies are preserved during transport, the total number of channels for a single spatial mode is the product $g_s g_v$. Consequently, the [quantized conductance](@entry_id:138407) for a single, perfectly transmitting subband is not the fundamental quantum $e^2/h$, but is enhanced to $G = g_s g_v (e^2/h)$. This idealized result highlights the role of valleys as parallel conduction pathways. In real devices, this degeneracy can be lifted by breaking the underlying symmetries. For instance, an external magnetic field breaks time-reversal symmetry and lifts the spin degeneracy, while applying specific types of strain can break the crystal symmetries that relate the valleys, thereby lifting the [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132). The observation of conductance steps splitting from $g_s g_v (e^2/h)$ into smaller increments is a direct experimental probe of these symmetry-breaking mechanisms [@problem_id:2999837].

In macroscopic, [diffusive transport](@entry_id:150792), the picture is more complex but the principle of parallel conduction channels persists. In a material like silicon, which has six equivalent conduction band valleys, the total conductivity is a sum of the contributions from all populated valleys. These valleys are often anisotropic, with different effective masses along different crystal axes. The overall conductivity effective mass, which determines the response to an electric field, is therefore an average over the contributions from all valleys, weighted by their orientation relative to the field. For an electric field along the $[100]$ direction in silicon, two valleys align their "heavy" longitudinal mass axis with the field, while four valleys align their "light" transverse mass axes. The resulting conductivity mass is a specific average of the longitudinal mass $m_l$ and transverse mass $m_t$, namely $m_c = 3 / (1/m_l + 2/m_t)$ [@problem_id:2485400].

In this [diffusive regime](@entry_id:149869), [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) plays a crucial role in limiting conductivity. While intravalley scattering by low-energy acoustic phonons is often a small-angle process that is inefficient at relaxing momentum, [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) necessarily involves a large momentum transfer on the order of the separation between valleys in the Brillouin zone. This makes [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) a highly effective mechanism for randomizing carrier momentum. In the definition of the momentum relaxation time, which includes a weighting factor of $(1 - \cos\theta)$ where $\theta$ is the scattering angle, the large angles typical of intervalley events give them a disproportionately large contribution to [resistivity](@entry_id:266481) compared to small-angle intravalley events [@problem_id:2485400].

#### Thermoelectric Effects

The distinction between different types of effective mass is pivotal in the field of [thermoelectrics](@entry_id:142625). The efficiency of a thermoelectric material is quantified by the dimensionless figure of merit, $ZT$, which is enhanced by a large Seebeck coefficient $S$ and high electrical conductivity $\sigma$, but a low thermal conductivity. A central challenge is that $S$ and $\sigma$ are often inversely related.

Valley degeneracy offers a powerful strategy, known as "[band engineering](@entry_id:193301)," to overcome this trade-off. The Seebeck coefficient in a [degenerate semiconductor](@entry_id:145114) is, according to the Mott formula, proportional to the [energy derivative](@entry_id:268961) of the logarithm of the conductivity at the Fermi energy. This can be shown to scale with the **[density-of-states effective mass](@entry_id:136362)**, $m^*_{DOS}$, which for a system with $N_v$ equivalent valleys of band mass $m_b$ is $m^*_{DOS} = N_v^{2/3} m_b$. In contrast, the mobility, $\mu = \sigma/(ne)$, is inversely proportional to the **conductivity effective mass**, $m_c$, which is related to the individual valley mass $m_b$.

By converging multiple valleys in energy (e.g., through alloying or strain), one can increase $N_v$ and thus dramatically increase $m^*_{DOS}$, leading to a significant enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient. Because the conductivity mass $m_b$ of each individual valley remains unchanged, this enhancement of $S$ does not come with the usual penalty of a severely [reduced mobility](@entry_id:754179). This principle of [decoupling](@entry_id:160890) the density-of-states mass from the transport mass is a cornerstone of modern high-performance thermoelectric material design [@problem_id:2532884].

#### Quantum Oscillations and the Quantum Hall Effect

In the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field, the continuous [energy spectrum](@entry_id:181780) of a two-dimensional electron system (2DES) coalesces into a series of discrete, highly degenerate Landau levels. The degeneracy of each Landau level is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength $B$, but it is also multiplied by the total internal flavor degeneracy, $g_s g_v$.

This has a direct impact on quantum oscillation phenomena, such as the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) effect, where resistivity oscillates as a function of $1/B$. These oscillations are periodic in $1/B$, with extrema occurring whenever an integer number of Landau levels is filled. Because the degeneracy of each level is enhanced by the factor $g_s g_v$, it takes a larger change in magnetic field to fill or empty a level for a fixed [carrier density](@entry_id:199230). This leads to an oscillation period $\Delta(1/B)$ that is directly proportional to the [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) $g_v$. Measuring the SdH period is therefore a powerful experimental tool for directly counting the number of degenerate valleys in a 2D material [@problem_id:3023537].

The role of valleys becomes even more intricate in the quantum Hall effect (QHE), particularly in materials like monolayer graphene. Graphene has $g_s=2$ and $g_v=2$, for a total degeneracy of 4. Due to its unique Dirac-like band structure, the Hall conductivity plateaus occur at half-integer filling factors, leading to a sequence $\sigma_{xy} = \nu e^2/h$ with $\nu = \pm 2, \pm 6, \pm 10, \ldots$. If a perturbation, such as strain or strong electron-electron interactions, lifts the [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132), the four-fold degenerate Landau levels split. This opens new [energy gaps](@entry_id:149280) in the spectrum, allowing for the emergence of new Hall plateaus. For instance, lifting the [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) while preserving spin degeneracy splits each Landau level into two, doubling the number of plateaus and leading to a sequence $\nu = 0, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 6, \ldots$. The appearance of a plateau at $\nu=0$ is a direct signature of a gap opening at the Dirac point. If, however, strong [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) is present, the energy broadening due to scattering can exceed the energy splitting between the valley levels. In this scenario, the two split levels effectively merge back into a single broadened level, and the new plateaus disappear, restoring the original sequence. The QHE thus serves as a sensitive probe not only of the existence of [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) but also of the mechanisms that lift it and the strength of [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) [@problem_id:3023540].

### Valleytronics: The Control of Valley Quantum Numbers

The realization that the valley index can serve as a stable, controllable quantum number has given rise to the field of [valleytronics](@entry_id:139774), which aims to store and process information using the valley degree of freedom, analogous to how [spintronics](@entry_id:141468) uses electron spin.

#### Optical Addressing and Readout

A prerequisite for [valleytronics](@entry_id:139774) is the ability to selectively populate and read out the state of a specific valley. In materials that lack spatial [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948), such as monolayer [transition metal dichalcogenides](@entry_id:143250) (TMDs), this can be achieved using [circularly polarized light](@entry_id:198374). Strong [spin-orbit coupling](@entry_id:143520) in these materials leads to a phenomenon called spin-valley locking, where the band-edge states in the $K$ and $K'$ valleys possess opposite spin projections. Time-reversal symmetry dictates that if an optical transition in the $K$ valley couples to right-handed circularly polarized ($\sigma^+$) light, the corresponding transition in the $K'$ valley must couple to left-handed ($\sigma^-$) light. The formation of a bound [electron-hole pair](@entry_id:142506) (an exciton) with a simple $s$-like [envelope function](@entry_id:749028) preserves these interband [selection rules](@entry_id:140784). Therefore, shining $\sigma^+$ light on a TMD monolayer predominantly creates [excitons](@entry_id:147299) in the $K$ valley, while $\sigma^-$ light creates them in the $K'$ valley. This provides a robust mechanism for optical initialization of a valley-polarized state [@problem_id:2987933].

The "readout" of this valley polarization is often performed by measuring the degree of [circular polarization](@entry_id:261702) of the subsequent [photoluminescence](@entry_id:147273) (PL). An exciton in the $K$ valley, upon recombining, will emit a $\sigma^+$ photon, while one in the $K'$ valley will emit a $\sigma^-$ photon. The net polarization of the emitted light is therefore a direct measure of the valley polarization of the [exciton](@entry_id:145621) population at the moment of recombination.

The persistence of this polarization is a dynamic process determined by the competition between the [exciton](@entry_id:145621)'s lifetime and the rate of [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281). In time-resolved experiments, an initial valley polarization $P(0)$ created by a short optical pulse is observed to decay exponentially, $P(t) = P(0) \exp(-t/\tau_v)$, where $\tau_v$ is the valley [depolarization](@entry_id:156483) time. This decay is governed by scattering events—mediated by phonons or [static disorder](@entry_id:144184)—that transfer excitons from one valley to another. The [depolarization](@entry_id:156483) rate $1/\tau_v$ is proportional to the total [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) rate [@problem_id:3002191]. In steady-state experiments, the observed PL polarization $P_c$ depends on the ratio of the exciton [recombination rate](@entry_id:203271) $\Gamma_r$ to the [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) rate $\Gamma_{iv}$, with the polarization being preserved if recombination is much faster than scattering ($P_c \propto (1 + 2\Gamma_{iv}/\Gamma_r)^{-1}$) [@problem_id:3023565]. The temperature dependence of these rates, particularly the [thermal activation](@entry_id:201301) of phonon-mediated scattering, explains the common experimental observation that valley polarization degrades rapidly with increasing temperature.

#### Spatial Transport and Valley-Based Devices

Beyond creating and detecting valley polarization locally, a key goal of [valleytronics](@entry_id:139774) is to transport this information spatially. A net flow of valley polarization constitutes a "valley current." In a diffusive system, the persistence of a valley-polarized population over distance is governed by the valley [diffusion length](@entry_id:172761), $\lambda_v = \sqrt{D \tau_{iv}}$, where $D$ is the diffusion constant and $\tau_{iv}$ is the [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) time. This is the [characteristic length](@entry_id:265857) scale over which a locally injected valley imbalance decays as it diffuses away from the source. Achieving long valley diffusion lengths is a critical materials challenge for realizing valleytronic devices [@problem_id:3023556].

The design of such devices often involves creating "valley filters" or "valley valves." A conceptual valley filter could be a nanoconstriction engineered to allow passage of electrons from one valley while blocking the other. In such a device, [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) within the constriction is a primary source of information loss. An electron entering in the "pass" valley ($K$) might scatter to the "block" valley ($K'$), leading to its reflection. This process reduces the overall transmission probability. For a filter of length $L$ where the mean free path for [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) is $\ell_v$, the conductance is exponentially suppressed as $G \propto \exp(-L/\ell_v)$, illustrating how [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) directly limits the performance of such conceptual devices [@problem_id:3023554].

### Valley Physics in Quantum Technologies and Advanced Materials

The valley degree of freedom plays an increasingly important role at the frontiers of quantum science, influencing the design of quantum bits, the nature of [topological phases](@entry_id:141674), and the behavior of [strongly correlated electron systems](@entry_id:183796).

#### Valley Splitting in Silicon Quantum Dots

Silicon is a leading platform for quantum computing, where the spin of a single electron confined in a [quantum dot](@entry_id:138036) can serve as a qubit. However, the [valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) of silicon's conduction band presents a significant challenge. While quantum confinement and strain in a typical Si/SiGe or Si/SiO$_2$ [heterostructure](@entry_id:144260) lift the bulk 6-fold degeneracy, a 2-fold degeneracy between the valleys oriented perpendicular to the interface remains. This residual degeneracy can interfere with qubit operations.

Fortunately, this last degeneracy is lifted by the sharp, atomistic nature of the interface itself, which breaks [translational symmetry](@entry_id:171614) and couples the two valley states. This creates a "valley splitting," an energy difference between the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the valley wavefunctions. The magnitude of this splitting is highly sensitive to the precise atomic configuration of the interface and the strength of the vertical electric field used for confinement. A stronger confining field squeezes the electron's wavefunction closer to the interface, enhancing its interaction with the symmetry-breaking potential and thus increasing the valley splitting. Understanding and controlling this valley splitting is a critical area of research, as it must be large enough to prevent unwanted transitions between valley states during qubit manipulation [@problem_id:3011924].

#### The Valley Hall Effect and Topological Edge States

In materials with broken inversion symmetry, the valley degree of freedom can be associated with a topological property. The Berry curvature, an effective magnetic field in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936), is constrained by time-reversal symmetry to be opposite in the $K$ and $K'$ valleys ($\Omega_K = -\Omega_{K'}$). While the total Chern number integrated over the entire Brillouin zone is zero, a "valley Chern number" integrated over a single valley can be non-zero.

This leads to the **Valley Hall Effect**: when an in-plane electric field is applied, electrons from the two valleys acquire an opposite transverse [anomalous velocity](@entry_id:146502), leading to a net flow of valley polarization—a valley current—in the transverse direction, even as the net charge current remains zero. More strikingly, at a domain wall between two regions with opposite signs of the inversion-[symmetry breaking](@entry_id:143062) (and thus opposite valley Chern numbers), [topologically protected edge states](@entry_id:160626) must appear. These consist of a pair of counter-propagating modes, with one direction of propagation locked to one valley and the opposite direction locked to the other. These [edge states](@entry_id:142513) are robust against [backscattering](@entry_id:142561) from smooth disorder that does not induce [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281). The structure of the physical edge of a sample can determine the strength of [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281); "zigzag" edges in graphene, for instance, are known to suppress [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) and allow for near-perfectly quantized edge conductance, while "armchair" edges can strongly couple the valleys and destroy this quantization [@problem_id:3023664].

#### Influence on Many-Body Phenomena

Valley degeneracy can profoundly influence collective electronic phenomena like superconductivity and metal-insulator transitions.

*   **Superconductivity:** The Cooper pairs that form the superconducting state have a wavefunction that must be antisymmetric under [particle exchange](@entry_id:154910). This wavefunction has spin, orbital, and, in a multivalley system, valley components. The existence of the valley degree of freedom opens up new possibilities for pairing symmetries. For instance, in addition to the conventional spin-singlet, orbital-$s$-wave pairing, a valley-antisymmetric, spin-triplet, orbital-$s$-wave state becomes allowed by the Pauli principle. Which state is favored depends on the nature of the [electron-electron interaction](@entry_id:189236). If the inter-valley interaction is repulsive, it can favor the formation of a valley-antisymmetric pair, which in turn requires a symmetric spin-[triplet state](@entry_id:156705) for an overall [antisymmetric wavefunction](@entry_id:153813). The valley structure is thus a crucial ingredient in determining the symmetry of [unconventional superconductors](@entry_id:141195) [@problem_id:2977175].

*   **Metal-Insulator Transitions:** In the theory of disordered, interacting [two-dimensional systems](@entry_id:274086), a large flavor degeneracy can suppress localization and drive a transition to a metallic state. Valley degeneracy can dramatically increase this flavor count. For a system with $g_v$ valleys, the number of "soft" multiplet modes that contribute delocalizing corrections in a renormalization group (RG) analysis scales as $4g_v^2 - 1$. For $g_v \ge 2$, this greatly enhances metallic tendencies. However, [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) acts as a mass term for the valley-related modes. At low temperatures or long length scales, these modes become "frozen out," effectively reducing the flavor degeneracy back to the pure spin case ($g_v=1$). This illustrates a fascinating crossover phenomenon where [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) can destroy a metal-insulator [quantum critical point](@entry_id:144325) and drive the system back towards the expected insulating state for a 2D system [@problem_id:2996254].

### Interdisciplinary Connections: Valley Physics Beyond Electrons

The concepts of valleys, Berry curvature, and [topological edge states](@entry_id:197201) are not exclusive to electrons. They are general properties of waves in periodic potentials. Consequently, analogs of the valley Hall effect have been discovered and engineered in purely classical systems.

In **photonic and [phononic crystals](@entry_id:156063)** with hexagonal lattice symmetry, it is possible to design structures where the [dispersion relations](@entry_id:140395) for light or sound waves exhibit Dirac-like touchings at the $K$ and $K'$ points of the Brillouin zone. By introducing a structural perturbation that breaks [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948) while preserving [time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094), these Dirac points can be gapped. Just as in the electronic case, this procedure endows the bands with a Berry curvature that is concentrated near the valleys and has opposite signs at $K$ and $K'$. This gives rise to a valley Hall effect for photons and phonons, where a gradient in the medium can cause light or sound wavepackets from different valleys to deflect in opposite transverse directions. Furthermore, creating a [domain wall](@entry_id:156559) between two crystals with opposite inversion-symmetry breaking leads to the formation of topologically guided [edge states](@entry_id:142513). These channels can robustly guide light or sound along a specified path, with protection against [backscattering](@entry_id:142561) from smooth bends and defects that do not induce [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281). This extension of valley physics to classical waves opens new avenues for robust waveguiding and information processing in acoustics and optics [@problem_id:3023691].
