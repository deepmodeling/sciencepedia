## Introduction
Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) represent a frontier in [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) physics, hosting exotic [electronic states](@entry_id:171776) that challenge our conventional understanding of metals. Their remarkable properties, such as unique surface states and [anomalous transport](@entry_id:746472) responses, are not accidental but are dictated by the deep topological nature of their [electronic band structure](@entry_id:136694). This article addresses the gap between the abstract theory of topology and its concrete physical manifestations in these materials, providing a structured journey from first principles to experimental observation.

The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, will lay the theoretical groundwork, defining Weyl nodes, explaining their topological stability, and deriving the concepts of Fermi arcs and the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077). Following this, the **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter will demonstrate how these theoretical predictions are verified in the lab and how they link to broader concepts in high-energy physics and hydrodynamics. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will provide opportunities to apply this knowledge through guided analytical and computational exercises. We begin by exploring the foundational principles that govern the unique electronic structure of these fascinating materials.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The exotic phenomena of Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) arise from unique topological features in their electronic band structure. These features, known as Weyl and Dirac nodes, are not mere curiosities but are governed by deep mathematical principles that dictate their stability, their arrangement in the [crystal momentum](@entry_id:136369) space, and their profound consequences for [electron transport](@entry_id:136976) and surface properties. This chapter will systematically elucidate these foundational principles and the mechanisms through which they manifest.

### The Nature and Topological Stability of Weyl Nodes

At the heart of a Weyl semimetal is the **Weyl node**, a point in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone where two non-degenerate [energy bands](@entry_id:146576) cross with a linear dispersion. For a system with two bands, the most general Hamiltonian near such a crossing point $\mathbf{k}_0$ can be written as:

$H(\mathbf{k}) = \mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k}) \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + d_0(\mathbf{k})\mathbb{I}$

Here, $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices representing a [pseudospin](@entry_id:147053) degree of freedom (such as orbital or sublattice), $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})$ is a three-component real vector function of momentum $\mathbf{k}$, and $d_0(\mathbf{k})\mathbb{I}$ is an energy shift that does not affect the topological properties. The [energy eigenvalues](@entry_id:144381) are $E_{\pm}(\mathbf{k}) = d_0(\mathbf{k}) \pm |\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})|$. A band touching occurs at momenta $\mathbf{k}_0$ where the gap closes, which requires $|\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k}_0)|=0$, or equivalently, $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k}_0) = \mathbf{0}$.

For the node to be a stable, [isolated point](@entry_id:146695), the mapping from momentum space $\mathbf{k}$ to the vector space of $\mathbf{d}$ must be locally invertible. If we linearize the map near the node, $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k}) \approx M(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}_0)$, the condition for an [isolated point](@entry_id:146695) node is that the $3 \times 3$ Jacobian matrix $M_{ij} = \partial d_i / \partial k_j |_{\mathbf{k}_0}$ must be non-singular, i.e., $\det(M) \neq 0$. When this condition is met, the dispersion is linear in all directions, forming a cone-like structure, and the node is a Weyl node.

Associated with each Weyl node is a quantized [topological invariant](@entry_id:142028) known as **[chirality](@entry_id:144105)**, denoted by $\chi$. This integer charge determines the node's "handedness" and is responsible for its stability. The [chirality](@entry_id:144105) is given by the orientation of the local [linear map](@entry_id:201112) from $\mathbf{k}$-space to $\mathbf{d}$-space, mathematically expressed as the sign of the Jacobian determinant [@problem_id:3024257]:

$\chi = \mathrm{sgn}(\det(M))$

A Weyl node with $\chi=+1$ is termed right-handed, and one with $\chi=-1$ is left-handed. Because the chirality is an integer, it cannot be changed by small, continuous perturbations to the Hamiltonian. A perturbation might shift the node's position in momentum space or warp the shape of the cone, but it cannot remove the node or change its [chirality](@entry_id:144105). To annihilate a Weyl node, it must be brought into contact with another Weyl node of opposite chirality.

This stability can be understood from a more global topological perspective. A Weyl node acts as a **monopole of Berry curvature** in momentum space. The Berry curvature $\boldsymbol{\Omega}(\mathbf{k})$ is a geometric property of the Bloch wavefunctions that acts like a fictitious magnetic field in the Brillouin zone. The [chirality](@entry_id:144105) of a Weyl node is precisely the total flux of Berry curvature emanating from it, quantified by the first **Chern number** calculated on a small, closed 2D surface (a sphere) enclosing the node in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936) [@problem_id:3024309]:

$\chi = \frac{1}{2\pi} \oint_{S^2} \boldsymbol{\Omega}(\mathbf{k}) \cdot d\mathbf{S}$

A Weyl node is therefore topologically protected because it carries a non-zero integer charge. This protection distinguishes it from "accidental" band touchings, which are not guaranteed by any symmetry and possess a total Berry curvature flux of zero. For an accidental node, the map $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})$ is not locally surjective onto a sphere in $\mathbf{d}$-space, resulting in a zero winding number and thus zero topological charge. Consequently, a generic small perturbation (e.g., a constant term like $m\sigma_z$) can easily open a gap at an accidental node, whereas a Weyl node remains robust [@problem_id:3024309].

### Weyl Nodes in Crystal Lattices: The Nielsen-Ninomiya Theorem

While a single Weyl node is a stable entity, it cannot exist in isolation within the Brillouin zone of a periodic crystal. The **Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem** states that Weyl nodes in a lattice must appear in pairs of opposite chirality. Consequently, the sum of the chiralities of all Weyl nodes within the entire Brillouin zone must be zero [@problem_id:3024297]:

$\sum_{i} \chi_i = 0$

This fundamental "no-go" theorem can be justified from several perspectives:

1.  **Topological Argument**: The Brillouin zone, due to its periodic nature, has the topology of a 3-torus ($T^3$), which is a [compact manifold](@entry_id:158804) without a boundary. The Poincaré-Hopf theorem states that the sum of the indices of the [isolated zeros](@entry_id:177353) of any smooth vector field on a [compact manifold](@entry_id:158804) is equal to the Euler characteristic of that manifold. For our system, the vector field is $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})$, its zeros are the Weyl nodes, and the chirality $\chi_i$ is precisely the index of the vector field at the $i$-th zero. The Euler characteristic of a 3-torus is $\chi(T^3)=0$, which directly implies that the sum of the chiralities must be zero [@problem_id:3024297].

2.  **Differential Geometry Argument**: Viewing the total Berry curvature $\boldsymbol{\Omega}(\mathbf{k})$ as a vector field on the BZ, the divergence theorem on a [compact manifold](@entry_id:158804) without a boundary (the BZ) requires $\int_{\text{BZ}} (\nabla_{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\Omega}) d^3k = 0$. Since the Weyl nodes are the monopoles of Berry curvature, we can write $\nabla_{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\Omega} = 2\pi \sum_i \chi_i \delta(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}_i)$. Integrating this over the BZ gives $2\pi \sum_i \chi_i$, which must equal zero [@problem_id:3024297].

3.  **Symmetry Constraints**: Crystal symmetries provide explicit mechanisms for satisfying the theorem. For example, a system with **[time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094) (TRS)** maps a Weyl node at $\mathbf{k}$ to another at $-\mathbf{k}$ with the *same* chirality. Thus, TRS-invariant Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) must have at least two pairs of nodes (a minimum of four nodes total) to ensure the net [chirality](@entry_id:144105) vanishes. In contrast, a system with **spatial [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948) (IS)** maps a node at $\mathbf{k}$ to one at $-\mathbf{k}$ with *opposite* [chirality](@entry_id:144105), directly creating a charge-neutral pair [@problem_id:3024297].

The interplay of symmetries is crucial. In fact, to have stable Weyl nodes, a system must break either TRS or IS. A system with both TRS and IS cannot host Weyl nodes. Instead, it may host **Dirac nodes**, which are four-fold degenerate points protected by the combination of these symmetries. A Dirac node can be conceptualized as two Weyl nodes of opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105) residing at the same point in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). Breaking either TRS or IS splits this degeneracy, separating the constituent Weyl nodes in momentum space. For example, in a material like $\text{Cd}_3\text{As}_2$, a Dirac point can be split by a TRS-breaking term $b_z \tau_0 \otimes \sigma_z$, which acts like a momentum-independent Zeeman field. This perturbation separates the two Weyl nodes along the momentum axis parallel to the field, with a separation given by $\Delta k_z = 2\sqrt{b_z^2 - m^2}/v_z$, where $m$ is a mass term that gaps the node and must be smaller than the splitting term $b_z$ for the Weyl phase to exist [@problem_id:3024251].

### Bulk-Boundary Correspondence and Fermi Arcs

The most striking experimental signature of the non-trivial bulk topology of a Weyl semimetal is the existence of exotic surface states known as **Fermi arcs**. These are open-ended segments of a Fermi surface that exist only on the boundary of the material. Their existence is a direct consequence of the **[bulk-boundary correspondence](@entry_id:137647)**.

To understand their origin, it is instructive to view the 3D Brillouin zone as a continuous stack of 2D slices. Let us consider slices of constant $k_z$ in a system where Weyl nodes are separated along the $k_z$ axis [@problem_id:3024275]. For any value of $k_z$ that does not coincide with a Weyl node, the 2D subsystem on the $(k_x, k_y)$ plane is fully gapped. For such a gapped 2D system, we can define an integer topological invariant, the **slice Chern number** $C(k_z)$:

$C(k_z) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\text{BZ}_{2\text{D}}} \Omega_z(\mathbf{k}) d k_x d k_y$

where $\Omega_z$ is the component of the Berry curvature normal to the slice. As one sweeps $k_z$ across a Weyl node of [chirality](@entry_id:144105) $\chi$, the value of $C(k_z)$ jumps discontinuously by that integer value: $\Delta C = \chi$. This is a direct result of the Weyl node being a monopole source of Berry curvature; crossing the node changes the net flux penetrating the 2D slice [@problem_id:3024275].

According to the [bulk-boundary correspondence](@entry_id:137647) for 2D Chern insulators, a boundary of a system with a non-zero Chern number $C$ must host $|C|$ [chiral edge states](@entry_id:138111). Applying this principle to our stack of 2D slices, any slice with $k_z$ between the two Weyl nodes will have a non-zero $C(k_z)$ and must therefore support chiral states localized on the surface of the crystal. The collection of these 1D chiral states, existing only for the range of momenta between the projected Weyl nodes, forms a 2D surface band.

The **Fermi arc** is the constant-energy contour of this surface band at the Fermi level. It is an *open contour* in the 2D surface Brillouin zone because the surface states that form it only exist for a finite range of momentum. The arc begins at the surface projection of one bulk Weyl node and terminates at the projection of the other node of opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105) [@problem_id:3024294] [@problem_id:3024275]. At these termination points, the bulk energy gap closes, and the surface states merge into the bulk continuum. The existence of these topologically protected arcs, connecting bulk nodes of opposite charge, is a unique fingerprint of a Weyl semimetal.

### The Chiral Anomaly and Electromagnetic Response

Weyl fermions exhibit a quantum mechanical anomaly known as the **[chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077)**, where the independent conservation of left-handed and right-handed particles is violated by external [electromagnetic fields](@entry_id:272866). In a Weyl semimetal, this leads to a remarkable electromagnetic response.

The physical mechanism can be visualized by considering the effect of parallel electric ($\mathbf{E}$) and magnetic ($\mathbf{B}$) fields. The magnetic field quantizes the electron orbits into Landau levels. For a Weyl node, a special **zeroth Landau level (LLL)** appears, which is chiral and has a 1D linear dispersion along the field direction, $E(k_\parallel) = \chi \hbar v_F k_\parallel$. The parallel electric field then acts on the states in this LLL, causing their momentum to evolve according to $\hbar \dot{k}_\parallel = e E$. This creates a continuous flow of states along the 1D band, a process known as **[spectral flow](@entry_id:146831)**. For a right-handed node ($\chi=+1$), states are pumped from occupied states at large negative $k_\parallel$ to empty states at large positive $k_\parallel$, continuously creating right-handed particles. For a left-handed node ($\chi=-1$), the opposite occurs, and [left-handed particles](@entry_id:161531) are destroyed.

The rate of this pumping process is fixed by topology. The density of states in the LLL per unit momentum is given by the Landau level degeneracy per unit area, $eB/(2\pi\hbar)$, divided by $2\pi$. Multiplying by the rate of momentum change $\dot{k}_\parallel$ gives the rate of [particle creation](@entry_id:158755) for a single chirality. For the axial [charge density](@entry_id:144672) $n_5 = n_R - n_L$, the net rate of change is given by the celebrated **[chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) equation** [@problem_id:3024265]:

$\frac{\partial n_5}{\partial t} = \frac{e^2}{2\pi^2\hbar^2} \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$

The prefactor in this equation, $e^2/(2\pi^2\hbar^2)$, is a universal constant, independent of material-specific details like the Fermi velocity. This universality is a deep consequence of the topological nature of the Weyl node. The derivation relies only on the fundamental Landau level degeneracy and the semiclassical acceleration law, both of which are rooted in [gauge invariance](@entry_id:137857) and protected from interaction-induced renormalizations. A more formal [kinetic theory](@entry_id:136901) approach shows that this result is robust even at finite temperature and chemical potential; the final result arises from a topological boundary term in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936) that is insensitive to the details of the Fermi-Dirac distribution [@problem_id:3024271] [@problem_id:3024265].

This anomalous pumping has observable consequences for transport:

1.  **Negative Longitudinal Magnetoresistance**: The [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) continuously pumps axial charge, creating a population imbalance $n_5$ between the two nodes. This imbalance is equivalent to a non-equilibrium **axial chemical potential**, $\mu_5 = \mu_R - \mu_L$. In a real material, scattering processes between the nodes (characterized by an [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) time $\tau_v$) will tend to relax this imbalance. In a steady state driven by the fields, the pumping rate and relaxation rate balance, leading to a finite steady-state $\mu_5 \propto \tau_v (\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B})$. This non-zero axial chemical potential, in turn, drives a real electrical current along the magnetic field via the **Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME)**: $\mathbf{j}_{\text{CME}} = \frac{e^2}{2\pi^2\hbar^2} \mu_5 \mathbf{B}$. Combining these effects, one finds an additional contribution to the longitudinal conductivity that is positive and quadratic in the magnetic field, $\sigma_{zz} \propto \tau_v B^2$. This corresponds to a decrease in [resistivity](@entry_id:266481) as the magnetic field increases, a phenomenon known as **[negative longitudinal magnetoresistance](@entry_id:146729)**. It is crucial to note that this transport coefficient, unlike the anomaly coefficient itself, is **non-universal**. It depends explicitly on the [scattering time](@entry_id:272979) $\tau_v$ and the [density of states](@entry_id:147894), both of which are microscopic details sensitive to interactions and disorder [@problem_id:3024312] [@problem_id:3024265]. It is also important to recognize that a true CME transport current is an intrinsically non-equilibrium phenomenon. In [thermodynamic equilibrium](@entry_id:141660), a static, uniform CME current is forbidden; the effect of a static axial chemical potential manifests as an equilibrium [orbital magnetization](@entry_id:140399) current, not a net transport current [@problem_id:3024260].

2.  **Anomalous Hall Effect**: In a Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry, the Weyl nodes are separated in momentum space. This separation leads to an intrinsic **Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE)**. The transverse Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ can be expressed as an integral of the Berry curvature over the occupied states in the Brillouin zone. Using the slice Chern number picture, this integral can be rewritten as:
    $\sigma_{xy} = \frac{e^2}{h} \int \frac{dk_z}{2\pi} C(k_z)$
    Since $C(k_z)$ is a step-like function that is non-zero between the nodes, this integral is directly proportional to the momentum-space separation of the Weyl nodes. Thus, the AHE in a Weyl semimetal is a direct measure of its bulk topological structure [@problem_id:3024275].
