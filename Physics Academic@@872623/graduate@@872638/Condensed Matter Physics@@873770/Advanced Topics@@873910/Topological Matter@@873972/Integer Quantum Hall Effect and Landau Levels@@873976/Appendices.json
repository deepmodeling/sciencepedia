The kinetic momentum operator $\\boldsymbol{\\Pi}$ is defined via minimal coupling as $\\boldsymbol{\\Pi} = \\mathbf{p} + |e|\\mathbf{A}$, where $\\mathbf{p} = (p_x, p_y)$ is the canonical momentum operator, $-|e|$ is the electron charge, and $\\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential for the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The components of the kinetic momentum are $\\Pi_x = p_x + |e|A_x$ and $\\Pi_y = p_y + |e|A_y$.\n\nThe fundamental operator algebra is built upon the canonical commutation relations for the position and momentum operators: $[x, p_x] = i\\hbar$, $[y, p_y] = i\\hbar$, and all other commutators between $\\{x, y, p_x, p_y\\}$ are zero. We must first construct the algebra for the kinetic momenta. The commutator of the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\Pi}$ is:\n$$\n[\\Pi_x, \\Pi_y] = [p_x + |e|A_x, p_y + |e|A_y]\n$$\nExpanding this gives:\n$$\n[\\Pi_x, \\Pi_y] = [p_x, p_y] + |e|[p_x, A_y] + |e|[A_x, p_y] + |e|^2[A_x, A_y]\n$$\nSince $[p_x, p_y]=0$ and the components of $\\mathbf{A}$ are functions of position and thus commute with each other ($[A_x, A_y]=0$), this simplifies to:\n$$\n[\\Pi_x, \\Pi_y] = |e|([p_x, A_y] - [p_y, A_x])\n$$\nUsing the relation $[p_j, f(\\mathbf{r})] = -i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r_j}$, we have:\n$$\n[\\Pi_x, \\Pi_y] = |e|(-i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial x} - (-i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial y})) = i\\hbar|e|(\\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial x})\n$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is the $z$-component of the curl of $\\mathbf{A}$, which is $B_z = B$.

For the isotropic-equivalent system, the ladder operators $a$ and $a^\\dagger$ are constructed from $\\Pi'_x$ and $\\Pi'_y$.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the single-particle Schrödinger equation for an electron in crossed electric and magnetic fields.\n\nAn electron with charge $-e$ moving in the 2DEG is described by the Hamiltonian:\n$$\nH = \\frac{1}{2m}(\\mathbf{p} + e\\mathbf{A})^2 - e\\Phi\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the effective mass of the electron, $\\mathbf{p}$ is the canonical momentum operator, $\\mathbf{A}$ is the magnetic vector potential, and $\\Phi$ is the electrostatic scalar potential. The fields are given by $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\Phi$.\n\nWe are given $\\mathbf{B} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ and $\\mathbf{E} = E_y\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. We choose the Landau gauge for the vector potential, which is convenient for a system with translational invariance in the $x$ direction:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = (-By, 0, 0)\n$$\nThis choice correctly yields $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The electric field $\\mathbf{E} = E_y\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ corresponds to a scalar potential $\\Phi(y) = -E_y y$.\n\nSubstituting these potentials into the Hamiltonian, we get:\n$$\nH = \\frac{1}{2m}((p_x-eBy)^2 + p_y^2) + eE_y y\n$$\nSince the Hamiltonian is independent of $x$, the momentum operator $p_x$ commutes with $H$, $[p_x, H] = 0$. Therefore, we can find simultaneous eigenstates of $H$ and $p_x$. The eigenfunctions can be written in the form:\n$$\n\\psi(x, y) = e^{ik_x x} f(y)\n$$\nwhere $\\hbar k_x$ is the eigenvalue of $p_x$. Acting on $\\psi(x,y)$ with the Hamiltonian gives an equation for $f(y)$:\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{1}{2m}((\\hbar k_x - eBy)^2 + p_y^2) + eE_y y \\right] f(y) = \\mathcal{E} f(y)\n$$\nwhere $p_y = -i\\hbar\\frac{d}{dy}$. We can rewrite the potential energy term by completing the square. The term in the square brackets is an effective 1D Hamiltonian for the $y$ motion:\n$$\nH_y = \\frac{p_y^2}{2m} + \\frac{(eB)^2}{2m}\\left(y - \\frac{\\hbar k_x}{eB}\\right)^2 + eE_y y\n$$\nThis is the Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator centered at $y_0 = \\frac{\\hbar k_x}{eB}$, subject to an additional linear potential $eE_y y$.

The energy eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{n, k_x} = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega_c + \\hbar k_x \\frac{E_y}{B} - \\frac{1}{2}m\\left(\\frac{E_y}{B}\\right)^2\n$$\nwhere $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the Landau level index. This shows that the electric field tilts the previously flat Landau levels, making the energy depend linearly on $k_x$.\n\nThe current carried by the electrons is found by summing the contributions from all occupied states. The velocity of an electron in a state $(n, k_x)$ is given by the group velocity:\n$$\nv_x = \\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}_{n, k_x}}{\\partial k_x} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_x} \\left[ \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega_c + \\hbar k_x \\frac{E_y}{B} - \\frac{1}{2}m\\left(\\frac{E_y}{B}\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nv_x = \\frac{E_y}{B}\n$$\nThis is a crucial result: every electron, regardless of its Landau level $n$, moves with the same drift velocity $v_x = E_y/B$. This velocity is identical to the classical drift velocity of a charged particle in crossed electric and magnetic fields.\n\nThe total current $I_x$ is the product of the sheet current density $K_x$ and the sample width $W$. The sheet current density is the charge per unit area multiplied by the velocity: $K_x = \\sigma_q v_x$, where $\\sigma_q = n_{2D}(-e)$ is the 2D charge density.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of states per unit area for a single Landau level. The centers of the wavefunctions, $y_c$, must lie within the sample width, $0  y_c  W$.\n$$\n0  \\frac{\\hbar k_x}{eB} - \\frac{m E_y}{eB^2}  W\n$$\nThis defines a range of allowed $k_x$ values. The number of states is more easily found by considering the degeneracy of a Landau level in the absence of an electric field. For a sample of area $A = L_x W$, the number of quantum states in a single spin-resolved Landau level is given by the number of flux quanta $\\Phi_0 = h/e$ that can thread the area:\n$$\nN_{LL} = \\frac{\\Phi}{\\Phi_0} = \\frac{BA}{h/e} = \\frac{eBA}{h}\n$$\nThe density of states per unit area for one Landau level is therefore:\n$$\nD_{LL} = \\frac{N_{LL}}{A} = \\frac{eB}{h}\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\nu$ spin-resolved Landau levels are completely filled. The total 2D electron density $n_{2D}$ is:\n$$\nn_{2D} = \\nu D_{LL} = \\nu \\frac{eB}{h}\n$$\nThe sheet charge density is $\\sigma_q = -e n_{2D} = -\\nu \\frac{e^2 B}{h}$.\nThe sheet current density $K_x$ is:\n$$\nK_x = \\sigma_q v_x = \\left(-\\nu \\frac{e^2 B}{h}\\right) \\left(\\frac{E_y}{B}\\right) = -\\nu \\frac{e^2}{h} E_y\n$$\nThe total current $I_x$ flowing along the sample is the sheet current density multiplied by the transverse width $W$ of the sample:\n$$\nI_x = K_x W = -\\nu \\frac{e^2}{h} E_y W\n$$\nThe problem states that the electric field strength is $E_y = U/W$, so $U = E_y W$. Substituting this into the expression for the current:\n$$\nI_x = -\\nu \\frac{e^2}{h} U\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the conventional current flows in the direction opposite to the potential gradient U if U is defined as V(W)-V(0). Given the setup $V(y) = -E_y y$, $V(W)-V(0) = -U0$. But the problem asks for the magnitude of the stationary Hall current. The magnitude is:\n$$\n|I_x| = \\nu \\frac{e^2}{h} U\n$$\nThis expression gives the quantized Hall current in terms of the number of filled Landau levels $\\nu$, the applied transverse potential difference $U$, and the fundamental constants $e$ and $h$.

Inverting the definitions of $a$ and $a^{\\dagger}$:\n$$\\Pi_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}l_B}(a+a^{\\dagger})$$\n$$\\Pi_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{i\\sqrt{2}l_B}(a-a^{\\dagger})$$\nSubstituting these into $H_0$:\n$$H_0 = v_F \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}l_B} [ \\sigma_x(a+a^{\\dagger}) + \\sigma_y \\frac{1}{i}(a-a^{\\dagger}) ] = v_F \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}l_B} [ a(\\sigma_x - i\\sigma_y) + a^{\\dagger}(\\sigma_x + i\\sigma_y) ]$$\nUsing the definitions of the Pauli raising and lowering operators, $\\sigma_+ = (\\sigma_x + i\\sigma_y)/2$ and $\\sigma_- = (\\sigma_x - i\\sigma_y)/2$, we get:\n$$H_0 = v_F \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}l_B} [ 2a\\sigma_- + 2a^{\\dagger}\\sigma_+ ] = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}v_F\\hbar}{l_B}(\\sigma_+ a^{\\dagger} + \\sigma_- a)$$\nIn the basis of pseudospin states, where $\\sigma_+ = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\sigma_- = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, the Hamiltonian $H_0$ can be written as a $2 \\times 2$ matrix:\n$$H_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}v_F\\hbar}{l_B} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  a^{\\dagger} \\\\ a  0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nWe seek eigenstates $\\Psi$ such that $H_0 \\Psi = E' \\Psi$, where $E'$ are the eigenvalues of $H_0$. Let us first consider the $n=0$ Landau level. The state $|0\\rangle$ is defined by $a|0\\rangle=0$. We propose an eigenstate of the form $\\Psi_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} c_A|0\\rangle \\\\ c_B|0\\rangle \\end{pmatrix}$. Application of $H_0$ gives:\n$$H_0 \\Psi_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}v_F\\hbar}{l_B} \\begin{pmatrix} c_B a^{\\dagger}|0\\rangle \\\\ c_A a|0\\rangle \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}v_F\\hbar}{l_B} \\begin{pmatrix} c_B|1\\rangle \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFor this to be an eigenstate, we must have $E'\\Psi_0 = E' \\begin{pmatrix} c_A|0\\rangle \\\\ c_B|0\\rangle \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}v_F\\hbar}{l_B} \\begin{pmatrix} c_B|1\\rangle \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This implies $c_B=0$ and $E'=0$. The resulting eigenstate is $\\Psi_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} |0\\rangle \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ with energy $E'_0=0$. This is the zeroth Landau level.\n\nFor the higher Landau levels ($n \\ge 1$), we propose an ansatz of the form $\\Psi_n = \\begin{pmatrix} c_A|n\\rangle \\\\ c_B|n-1\\rangle \\end{pmatrix}$. Applying $H_0$:\n$$H_0 \\Psi_n = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}v_F\\hbar}{l_B} \\begin{pmatrix} c_B a^{\\dagger}|n-1\\rangle \\\\ c_A a|n\\rangle \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}v_F\\hbar}{l_B} \\begin{pmatrix} c_B \\sqrt{n}|n\\rangle \\\\ c_A \\sqrt{n}|n-1\\rangle \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalue equation $H_0 \\Psi_n = E' \\Psi_n$ becomes:\n$$E' \\begin{pmatrix} c_A|n\\rangle \\\\ c_B|n-1\\rangle \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2n}v_F\\hbar}{l_B} \\begin{pmatrix} c_B |n\\rangle \\\\ c_A |n-1\\rangle \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis is equivalent to the matrix equation for the coefficients $(c_A, c_B)$:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{\\sqrt{2n}v_F\\hbar}{l_B} \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{2n}v_F\\hbar}{l_B}  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_A \\\\ c_B \\end{pmatrix} = E' \\begin{pmatrix} c_A \\\\ c_B \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalues $E'$ are given by $(E')^2 - (\\frac{\\sqrt{2n}v_F\\hbar}{l_B})^2 = 0$.\nSo, $E'_{n, \\lambda} = \\lambda \\frac{\\sqrt{2n}v_F\\hbar}{l_B} = \\lambda v_F \\sqrt{2n\\hbar|e|B}$, where $\\lambda = \\pm 1$. $\\lambda=+1$ corresponds to electron-like (conduction) states and $\\lambda=-1$ to hole-like (valence) states.\n\nThe total energy, including the Zeeman term, is $E = E' + s g \\mu_B B$. The complete Landau-level spectrum for graphene is:\n$$E_{0,s} = s g \\mu_B B \\quad (\\text{for } n=0)$$\n$$E_{n,\\lambda,s} = \\lambda v_F \\sqrt{2n\\hbar|e|B} + s g \\mu_B B \\quad (\\text{for } n \\ge 1)$$\n\nWe need to find the angular frequency $\\omega_{0 \\to 1}^{(\\uparrow)}$ for the transition from the $n=0$ level to the $n=1$ conduction-branch level for spin-up electrons ($s=+\\frac{1}{2}$).\nThe initial state is the $n=0$, spin-up level. Its energy is:\n$$E_i = E_{0, s=+1/2} = +\\frac{1}{2} g \\mu_B B$$\nThe final state is the $n=1$, conduction-branch ($\\lambda=+1$), spin-up level. Its energy is:\n$$E_f = E_{1, \\lambda=+1, s=+1/2} = (+1) v_F \\sqrt{2(1)\\hbar|e|B} + \\frac{1}{2} g \\mu_B B = v_F \\sqrt{2\\hbar|e|B} + \\frac{1}{2} g \\mu_B B$$\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is $\\Delta E = E_f - E_i$:\n$$\\Delta E = \\left(v_F \\sqrt{2\\hbar|e|B} + \\frac{1}{2} g \\mu_B B\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} g \\mu_B B\\right) = v_F \\sqrt{2\\hbar|e|B}$$\nThe corresponding angular frequency is $\\omega = \\Delta E / \\hbar$:\n$$\\omega_{0 \\to 1}^{(\\uparrow)} = \\frac{v_F \\sqrt{2\\hbar|e|B}}{\\hbar} = v_F \\sqrt{\\frac{2|e|B}{\\hbar}}$$\n\nNow we substitute the provided numerical values:\n$v_{F} = 1.00 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n$B = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n$|e| = 1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n$\\hbar = 1.054\\,571\\,817 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\cdot s}$\n\n$$\\omega_{0 \\to 1}^{(\\uparrow)} = (1.00 \\times 10^6) \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times 12.0}{1.054\\,571\\,817 \\times 10^{-34}}}$$\n$$\\omega_{0 \\to 1}^{(\\uparrow)} = (1.00 \\times 10^6) \\sqrt{\\frac{3.8452239216 \\times 10^{-18}}{1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}}}$$\n$$\\omega_{0 \\to 1}^{(\\uparrow)} = (1.00 \\times 10^6) \\sqrt{3.646153603 \\times 10^{16}}$$\n$$\\omega_{0 \\to 1}^{(\\uparrow)} = (1.00 \\times 10^6) \\times (1.909490398 \\times 10^8)$$\n$$\\omega_{0 \\to 1}^{(\\uparrow)} = 1.909490398 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\\omega_{0 \\to 1}^{(\\uparrow)} \\approx 1.909 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.909 \\times 10^{14}}$$", "id": "2996082"}]}
