The concepts of space groups ($p4mm$), point groups ($C_{4v}$), Brillouin zones, high-symmetry points ($\\Gamma$, $M$), little groups, and irreducible representations are fundamental to condensed matter physics.

The questions are precise and lead to a unique, determinable solution using standard group-theoretical methods.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using formal, objective language devoid of any subjective or opinion-based content.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## Solution\n\n### Part 1: Determination of the Little Groups\nThe little group $G_{\\mathbf{k}}$ at a wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ is the subgroup of the space group $G$ containing all space group operations $g=\\{R|\\mathbf{v}\\}$ (where $R$ is a point group operation and $\\mathbf{v}$ is a translation) that leave $\\mathbf{k}$ invariant up to a reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{K}$. The condition is $R\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{k} + \\mathbf{K}$. The set of all such rotational parts $R$ forms the point group of the little group, denoted as $G_{0,\\mathbf{k}}$. The reciprocal lattice is generated by vectors $\\mathbf{K}_{n,m} = n(2\\pi,0) + m(0,2\\pi)$ for integers $n, m$.\n\n- **At the $\\Gamma$ point, $\\mathbf{k}_{\\Gamma} = (0,0)$**:\nFor any point group operation $R \\in C_{4v}$, its action on $\\mathbf{k}_{\\Gamma}$ is $R\\mathbf{k}_{\\Gamma} = R(0,0) = (0,0) = \\mathbf{k}_{\\Gamma}$. This is invariant with $\\mathbf{K}=0$. Therefore, every element of the crystal's point group $C_{4v}$ is in the little point group at $\\Gamma$.\nThus, the little point group at $\\Gamma$ is the full point group: $G_{0,\\Gamma} = C_{4v}$.\n\n- **At the $M$ point, $\\mathbf{k}_{M} = (\\pi,\\pi)$**:\nWe must check which operations $R \\in C_{4v}$ leave $\\mathbf{k}_{M}$ invariant up to a reciprocal lattice vector. The generators of $C_{4v}$ are $C_4$ (rotation by $\\pi/2$) and a vertical mirror $\\sigma_v$ (e.g., reflection across the y-axis, $x \\to -x$).\n1.  Action of $C_4$ (counter-clockwise rotation): The matrix for $C_4$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $$C_4 \\mathbf{k}_M = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\pi \\\\ \\pi \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\pi \\\\ \\pi \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    We check if $(-\\pi, \\pi)$ is equivalent to $(\\pi,\\pi)$.\n    $$(-\\pi, \\pi) = (\\pi, \\pi) + \\mathbf{K} \\implies \\mathbf{K} = (-2\\pi, 0)$$\n    This is a valid reciprocal lattice vector for $n=-1, m=0$. So, $C_4 \\in G_{0,M}$. Since $C_4$ is in the group, so are its powers $C_2=C_4^2$ and $C_4^3$.\n2.  Action of $\\sigma_v$ (reflection $x \\to -x$): The matrix for $\\sigma_v$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $$\\sigma_v \\mathbf{k}_M = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\pi \\\\ \\pi \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\pi \\\\ \\pi \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    This is the same result as for $C_4$, and is equivalent to $\\mathbf{k}_M$. So, $\\sigma_v \\in G_{0,M}$.\nSince the generators $C_4$ and $\\sigma_v$ are in $G_{0,M}$, all elements of the group they generate, which is $C_{4v}$, are also in $G_{0,M}$.\nThus, the little point group at $M$ is also the full point group: $G_{0,M} = C_{4v}$.\n\n### Part 2: Allowed Irreducible Representations\nFor spinless electrons, the electronic wavefunctions at a given $\\mathbf{k}$-point must transform according to a single-valued irreducible representation of the little point group $G_{0,\\mathbf{k}}$. Since the little point group at both $\\Gamma$ and $M$ is $C_{4v}$, the allowed irreps at these momenta are the single-valued irreps of $C_{4v}$. The point group $C_{4v}$ has five such irreps: four one-dimensional irreps denoted $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$, $B_2$, and one two-dimensional irrep denoted $E$. No further constraints are given, so all are possible.\n\n### Part 3: Character of the $C_4$ Element\nThe character $\\chi(g)$ of a group element $g$ in a given representation is the trace of its representation matrix, $\\chi(g) = \\text{Tr}[D(g)]$. We determine the character of the $C_4$ element for each of the five irreps of $C_{4v}$ by considering the transformation properties of their standard basis functions under a $\\pi/2$ rotation. Let the rotation map $(x,y) \\to (-y,x)$.\n\n- **$A_1$ (trivial irrep):** This irrep is totally symmetric. Its basis can be taken as a constant, $f(x,y)=1$, or an $s$-orbital like function. A rotation leaves it invariant: $D(C_4)f = 1 \\cdot f$. The representation matrix is the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $(1)$.\n$$\\chi_{A_1}(C_4) = 1$$\n\n- **$A_2$:** This irrep is symmetric under proper rotations but must be antisymmetric under vertical mirror planes to be distinct from $A_1$. Its basis transforms like an axial vector along the rotation axis, e.g., $L_z \\propto xp_y - yp_x$, which describes infinitesimal rotations in the $xy$-plane. An in-plane rotation $C_4$ a finite amount does not change the sense of rotation about the $z$-axis. Thus, the basis function is invariant under $C_4$: $D(C_4)f = 1 \\cdot f$.\n$$\\chi_{A_2}(C_4) = 1$$\n\n- **$B_1$:** This irrep is antisymmetric with respect to the principal rotation $C_4$. A standard basis function is $f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2$. Applying the $C_4$ transformation $(x,y) \\to (-y,x)$:\n$$f(-y,x) = (-y)^2 - (x)^2 = y^2 - x^2 = -(x^2 - y^2) = -1 \\cdot f(x,y)$$\nThe representation matrix is the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $(-1)$.\n$$\\chi_{B_1}(C_4) = -1$$\n\n- **$B_2$:** This irrep is also antisymmetric with respect to $C_4$, but has different mirror symmetries than $B_1$. A standard basis function is $f(x,y) = xy$. Applying the $C_4$ transformation:\n$$f(-y,x) = (-y)(x) = -xy = -1 \\cdot f(x,y)$$\nThe representation matrix is the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $(-1)$.\n$$\\chi_{B_2}(C_4) = -1$$\n\n- **$E$ (two-dimensional irrep):** This irrep transforms as a vector in the plane, with basis $(x,y)$. The transformation $(x,y) \\to (-y,x)$ can be written in matrix form:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe representation matrix is $D(C_4) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The character is its trace.\n$$\\chi_E(C_4) = \\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 + 0 = 0$$\n\nThe characters of the $C_4$ rotation for the irreps $(A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, E)$ are therefore $(1, 1, -1, -1, 0)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2979769"}, {"introduction": "The Wilson loop has emerged as a powerful theoretical tool for diagnosing the topology of band structures, acting as a momentum-space analogue of charge polarization.

This spectral flow is the bulk manifestation of charge pumping and is characteristic of a first-order topological phase with chiral edge states, governed by a nonzero first Chern number.

Therefore, for both occupied bands, the inversion eigenvalue is $\\xi(\\pi)=+1$.\n\nNow we compute the Zak phase for each of the two occupied bands (let's label them $n=1,2$):\n$$ e^{i\\theta_1} = \\frac{\\xi_1(\\pi)}{\\xi_1(0)} = \\frac{+1}{-1} = -1 \\implies \\theta_1=\\pi $$\n$$ e^{i\\theta_2} = \\frac{\\xi_2(\\pi)}{\\xi_2(0)} = \\frac{+1}{-1} = -1 \\implies \\theta_2=\\pi $$\nThus, the two Wilson loop eigenphases are both $\\pi$.\n\n**2. Nested Wilson loop spectrum along $k_y$**\n\nThe nested Wilson loop calculation involves computing the Berry phase of a Wannier state as a function of the transverse momentum, $k_y$. A Wannier state $|w_n(k_y)\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the Wilson loop operator $W_x(k_y)$:\n$$\nW_x(k_y)|w_n(k_y)\\rangle = e^{i\\theta_n(k_y)}|w_n(k_y)\\rangle\n$$\nThe problem specifies selecting a Wannier sector with eigenphase $\\pi$. From our previous calculation, both sectors have this eigenphase. Let's select one, say $|w_1(k_y)\\rangle$. The nested Wilson loop phase is then the Berry phase of this state:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\text{nested}} = \\oint dk_y \\, A_y^{(1)}(k_y) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad A_y^{(1)}(k_y) = i\\langle w_1(k_y)|\\partial_{k_y}|w_1(k_y)\\rangle\n$$\nThe crucial observation is that the Hamiltonian $H(k_x, k_y)$ is completely independent of $k_y$. This implies:\n1.  The Bloch eigenstates $|u_{a, \\mathbf{k}}\\rangle$ spanning the occupied subspace can be chosen to be independent of $k_y$. Let's denote them $|u_{a, k_x}\\rangle$.\n2.  The Berry connection matrix $\\mathcal{A}_x(\\mathbf{k})$ used to compute the Wilson loop is independent of $k_y$: $(\\mathcal{A}_x)_{ab}(k_x) = i \\langle u_{a, k_x} | \\partial_{k_x} u_{b, k_x} \\rangle$.\n3.  The Wilson loop operator $W_x(k_y) = \\mathcal{P}\\exp(-i\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\mathcal{A}_x(k_x) dk_x)$ is a constant matrix, independent of $k_y$.\n\nSince $W_x$ does not depend on $k_y$, its eigenvalues $\\theta_n$ are constant, and its eigenvectors, the Wannier states $|w_n(k_y)\\rangle$, can be chosen to be independent of $k_y$. Let's denote a basis of such constant Wannier states as $\\{|w_n\\rangle\\}$.\n\nFor the chosen Wannier state $|w_1(k_y)\\rangle=|w_1\\rangle$, the derivative with respect to $k_y$ is zero:\n$$\n\\partial_{k_y}|w_1(k_y)\\rangle = \\partial_{k_y}|w_1\\rangle = 0\n$$\nConsequently, the nested Berry connection $A_y^{(1)}(k_y)$ is identically zero for all $k_y$. The nested Berry phase is the integral of this zero connection, which is zero:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\text{nested}} = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} 0 \\, dk_y = 0\n$$\nThis result is physically sensible. The parameter choice $\\lambda_y=0$ effectively decouples the 1D chains, leading to a trivial band structure in the $y$-direction. The Wannier bands are flat, and a flat band has a trivial Berry phase of $0$.\n\nCombining the results, the two first Wilson loop eigenphases are $\\pi$ and $\\pi$, and the nested Wilson loop eigenphase is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\pi & \\pi & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2979709"}]}
