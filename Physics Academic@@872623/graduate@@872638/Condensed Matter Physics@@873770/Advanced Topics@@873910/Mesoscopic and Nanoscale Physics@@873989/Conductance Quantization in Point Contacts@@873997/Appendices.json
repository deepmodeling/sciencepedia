We must also explain how a corrected, intrinsic conductance can be extracted from measurements.\n\nFirst, we begin with the Landauer formula for the intrinsic conductance of the QPC. In the linear-response regime, the conductance is given by the sum of the transmission probabilities of all available conduction channels, scaled by the quantum of conductance, $G_{0}$. For spin-degenerate electrons, this quantum is $G_{0} = \\frac{2e^{2}}{h}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant. The intrinsic QPC conductance $G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}$ is thus:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{QPC}} = \\frac{2e^{2}}{h} \\sum_{n} T_{n}\n$$\nwhere $T_{n}$ is the transmission probability of the $n$-th transverse mode. The problem specifies that on a conductance plateau corresponding to $N$ open modes, we can approximate $T_{n} \\approx 1$ for the $N$ occupied modes and $T_{n} \\approx 0$ for all others. Under this condition, the intrinsic conductance becomes quantized in units of $G_{0}$:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{QPC}} = N \\frac{2e^{2}}{h} = N G_{0}\n$$\n\nNext, we model the experimental two-terminal measurement setup. The total device consists of the intrinsic QPC in series with a constant, gate-independent resistance $R_s$, which accounts for the contacts and leads. In such a series circuit, resistances add. The intrinsic resistance of the QPC is $R_{\\mathrm{QPC}}$, which is the reciprocal of its conductance:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{QPC}} = \\frac{1}{G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}}\n$$\nThe total resistance of the device, which we denote as $R_2$, is the sum of the series resistance and the QPC resistance:\n$$\nR_2 = R_s + R_{\\mathrm{QPC}} = R_s + \\frac{1}{G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}}\n$$\nThe experimentally measured two-terminal conductance, $G_2$, is defined as the ratio of the total current $I$ to the total applied voltage $V$, so $G_2 = I/V$. This is equivalent to the reciprocal of the total resistance $R_2$:\n$$\nG_2 = \\frac{1}{R_2} = \\frac{1}{R_s + \\frac{1}{G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}}}\n$$\nThis equation establishes the fundamental relationship between the measured conductance $G_2$, the series resistance $R_s$, and the intrinsic QPC conductance $G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}$. It is often more convenient to express this relationship in terms of resistances:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{G_2} = R_s + \\frac{1}{G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}}\n$$\n\nFrom this relationship, we can analyze the conductance correction. The measured conductance $G_2$ can be written as:\n$$\nG_2 = \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}}{1 + R_s G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}}\n$$\nThis shows that $G_2$ is always less than the intrinsic conductance $G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}$ when $R_s > 0$. The correction, or reduction in measured conductance, is $\\Delta G = G_{\\mathrm{QPC}} - G_2$. Substituting the expression for $G_2$:\n$$\n\\Delta G = G_{\\mathrm{QPC}} - \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}}{1 + R_s G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}} = G_{\\mathrm{QPC}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + R_s G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}} \\right) = \\frac{R_s G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}^{2}}{1 + R_s G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}}\n$$\nAs $G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}$ increases (i.e., for higher plateaus with larger $N$), the absolute correction $\\Delta G$ becomes larger. The plateaus in the measured conductance $G_2$ are consequently not perfectly quantized at integer multiples of $G_0$, but are suppressed to lower values.\n\nTo extract the intrinsic conductance $G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}$ from experimental data, one must first determine the value of the series resistance $R_s$. This can be achieved by analyzing the measured conductance values on the quantized plateaus. Let $G_{2,N}$ be the measured conductance on the $N$-th plateau, where the intrinsic conductance is $G_{\\mathrm{QPC},N} = N (2e^{2}/h)$. Substituting this into our resistance addition formula:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{G_{2,N}} = R_s + \\frac{1}{G_{\\mathrm{QPC},N}} = R_s + \\left( \\frac{h}{2e^{2}} \\right) \\frac{1}{N}\n$$\nThis equation has the form of a linear equation, $y = c + mx$, where $y = 1/G_{2,N}$ and $x = 1/N$. By plotting the inverse of the measured plateau conductances against the inverse of the plateau index $N$, one obtains a straight line. The y-intercept of this line (the limit as $1/N \\to 0$ or $N \\to \\infty$) directly yields the series resistance $R_s$. The slope is the resistance quantum $h/(2e^{2})$, which can serve as a consistency check.\n\nOnce $R_s$ is known from this procedure, we can correct any measured value of $G_2$ to find the corresponding intrinsic conductance $G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}$. To find the required expression for $G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}$ in terms of $G_2$ and $R_s$, we rearrange the equation $\\frac{1}{G_2} = R_s + \\frac{1}{G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}} = \\frac{1}{G_2} - R_s\n$$\nTo solve for $G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}$, we first find a common denominator for the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{G_{\\mathrm{QPC}}} = \\frac{1 - G_2 R_s}{G_2}\n$$\nFinally, taking the reciprocal of both sides gives the desired expression for the intrinsic QPC conductance:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{QPC}} = \\frac{G_2}{1 - G_2 R_s}\n$$\nThis formula allows for the removal of the artifact of series resistance from two-terminal conductance measurements, thereby revealing the underlying quantum transport properties of the mesoscopic conductor.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{G_2}{1 - G_2 R_s}}\n$$", "id": "2976791"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the linear-response regime, a QPC under a finite source-drain bias $V$ becomes a powerful tool for energy spectroscopy.
