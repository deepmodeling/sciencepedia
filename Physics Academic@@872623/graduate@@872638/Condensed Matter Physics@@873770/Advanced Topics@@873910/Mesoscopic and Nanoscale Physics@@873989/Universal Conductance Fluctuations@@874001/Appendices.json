It exhibits random but reproducible fluctuations as a function of external parameters such as magnetic field or Fermi energy. The variance of these fluctuations, $\\text{Var}(G) = \\langle (G - \\langle G \\rangle)^2 \\rangle$, is a cornerstone of the theory of Universal Conductance Fluctuations (UCF). For a sufficiently long wire (length $L$ much greater than the elastic mean free path $l_e$), this variance is predicted to be a universal constant, $\\text{Var}(G) = \\sigma_{ucf}^2$, which is of the order of $(e^2/h)^2$ and notably independent of the wire's length or its average conductance.\n\nConsider a long, uniform, diffusive wire with two terminals, whose conductance variance is the universal value $\\text{Var}(G_0) = \\sigma_{ucf}^2$. Now, an ideal dephasing probe is attached to the exact midpoint of this wire. An ideal dephasing probe acts as a third, floating terminal (drawing no net DC current) that completely randomizes the quantum-mechanical phase of any charge carrier that interacts with it. This process effectively divides the wire into two phase-incoherent segments.\n\nDetermine the factor $F$ by which the two-terminal conductance variance of the wire is reduced due to the presence of this dephasing probe.

Model the System**\n\nThe problem requires comparing the conductance variance of a single diffusive wire with that of a wire split into two by a dephasing probe.\n\n*   **System 0 (Original Wire):** A single phase-coherent diffusive wire of length $L$. According to the theory of Universal Conductance Fluctuations (UCF), its two-terminal conductance variance is a universal constant, which we denote as $\\sigma_{ucf}^2$.\n    $$ \\text{Var}(G_0) = \\sigma_{ucf}^2 $$\n\n*   **System P (Wire with Probe):** An ideal dephasing probe is attached to the midpoint. This probe breaks phase coherence between the left and right halves of the wire. The system can now be modeled as two independent diffusive conductors connected in series. Let's call them Wire A (left) and Wire B (right), each of length $L/2$. Let their respective conductances be $g_A$ and $g_B$.\n\n**2. Conductance of Series Incoherent Conductors**\n\nFor two conductors connected in series where phase coherence is broken at the junction, their total resistance is the sum of their individual resistances, $R_p = R_A + R_B$. In terms of conductance ($G=1/R$), this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{G_p} = \\frac{1}{g_A} + \\frac{1}{g_B} $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ G_p(g_A, g_B) = \\frac{g_A g_B}{g_A + g_B} $$\n\n**3. Propagation of Fluctuations**\n\nWe are interested in the variance of $G_p$, which arises from the fluctuations of $g_A$ and $g_B$. For small fluctuations, we can use a first-order Taylor expansion for the fluctuation $\\delta G_p$ around the mean values $\\langle g_A \\rangle$ and $\\langle g_B \\rangle$.\n$$ \\delta G_p \\approx \\frac{\\partial G_p}{\\partial g_A} \\delta g_A + \\frac{\\partial G_p}{\\partial g_B} \\delta g_B $$\nwhere the partial derivatives are evaluated at the mean values of $g_A$ and $g_B$.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives of $G_p(g_A, g_B)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial G_p}{\\partial g_A} = \\frac{g_B(g_A + g_B) - g_A g_B(1)}{(g_A + g_B)^2} = \\frac{g_B^2}{(g_A + g_B)^2} = \\left(\\frac{g_B}{g_A+g_B}\\right)^2 $$\nBy symmetry:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial G_p}{\\partial g_B} = \\left(\\frac{g_A}{g_A+g_B}\\right)^2 $$\nSince the probe is at the midpoint and the wire is uniform, the two segments are identical. Therefore, their average conductances are equal: $\\langle g_A \\rangle = \\langle g_B \\rangle = g_{1/2}$. Evaluating the derivatives at these mean values:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial G_p}{\\partial g_A} \\bigg|_{\\langle g_A \\rangle, \\langle g_B \\rangle} = \\left(\\frac{g_{1/2}}{g_{1/2}+g_{1/2}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{g_{1/2}}{2g_{1/2}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nSimilarly, $\\frac{\\partial G_p}{\\partial g_B} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the fluctuation:\n$$ \\delta G_p \\approx \\frac{1}{4} \\delta g_A + \\frac{1}{4} \\delta g_B = \\frac{1}{4}(\\delta g_A + \\delta g_B) $$\n\n**4. Calculate the Variance of the Probed System**\n\nThe variance of $G_p$ is the expectation value of $(\\delta G_p)^2$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(G_p) = \\langle (\\delta G_p)^2 \\rangle \\approx \\left\\langle \\left( \\frac{1}{4}(\\delta g_A + \\delta g_B) \\right)^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{16} \\langle (\\delta g_A + \\delta g_B)^2 \\rangle $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(G_p) = \\frac{1}{16} \\langle (\\delta g_A)^2 + (\\delta g_B)^2 + 2\\delta g_A \\delta g_B \\rangle $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(G_p) = \\frac{1}{16} \\left( \\langle (\\delta g_A)^2 \\rangle + \\langle (\\delta g_B)^2 \\rangle + 2\\langle \\delta g_A \\delta g_B \\rangle \\right) $$\nThe term $\\langle (\\delta g_A)^2 \\rangle$ is the variance of Wire A, $\\text{Var}(g_A)$, and similarly for Wire B. The crucial role of the ideal dephasing probe is to make the fluctuations in Wire A and Wire B statistically independent. For independent variables, the covariance is zero:\n$$ \\langle \\delta g_A \\delta g_B \\rangle = \\langle \\delta g_A \\rangle \\langle \\delta g_B \\rangle = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nTherefore, the variance becomes:\n$$ \\text{Var}(G_p) = \\frac{1}{16} (\\text{Var}(g_A) + \\text{Var}(g_B)) $$\n\n**5. Apply the Universality of UCF**\n\nA key aspect of UCF is that the conductance variance $\\sigma_{ucf}^2$ for a long diffusive wire is independent of its length (as long as $L \\gg l_e$ and phase coherence is maintained across its length). Wire A and Wire B are themselves long diffusive wires. Thus, their individual conductance variances are also equal to the universal value:\n$$ \\text{Var}(g_A) = \\sigma_{ucf}^2 $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(g_B) = \\sigma_{ucf}^2 $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\text{Var}(G_p)$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(G_p) = \\frac{1}{16} (\\sigma_{ucf}^2 + \\sigma_{ucf}^2) = \\frac{2}{16} \\sigma_{ucf}^2 = \\frac{1}{8} \\sigma_{ucf}^2 $$\n\n**6. Determine the Reduction Factor**\n\nThe reduction factor $F$ is the ratio of the variance with the probe to the variance without the probe:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\text{Var}(G_p)}{\\text{Var}(G_0)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{8} \\sigma_{ucf}^2}{\\sigma_{ucf}^2} $$\n$$ F = \\frac{1}{8} $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}} $$", "id": "1216490"}, {"introduction": "The \"universality\" in UCF is not absolute; the precise magnitude of the conductance variance depends critically on the fundamental symmetries of the Hamiltonian.

This class applies when TRS is broken, for instance, by an external magnetic field or by the presence of magnetic impurities.\n3.  **Symplectic Ensemble (SE):** Characterized by $\\beta=4$. This class applies when TRS is preserved, but spin-rotation symmetry is broken, which is typically caused by strong spin-orbit (SO) coupling.\n\nConsider a mesoscopic conductor where scattering is dominated by strong spin-orbit interactions, placing it firmly within the Symplectic Ensemble. Subsequently, a small concentration of magnetic impurities is introduced into the conductor. This addition introduces a new scattering mechanism that breaks time-reversal symmetry.\n\nBased on the information provided, determine whether the amplitude of the universal conductance fluctuations, defined as $\\delta g = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(g)}$, initially increases upon the addition of these magnetic impurities.
