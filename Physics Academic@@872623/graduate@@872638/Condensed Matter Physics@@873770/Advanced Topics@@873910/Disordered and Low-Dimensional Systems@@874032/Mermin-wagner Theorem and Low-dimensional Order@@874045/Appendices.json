By then analyzing the 2D XY model, you will uncover why the proliferation of low-energy Goldstone modes in systems with continuous symmetry makes such long-range order impossible at any finite temperature [@problem_id:3004730].", "problem": "Consider the two-dimensional square-lattice Ising ferromagnet with Hamiltonian $H = -J \\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle} \\sigma_{i}\\sigma_{j}$, where $\\sigma_{i} = \\pm 1$, $J > 0$, and the sum is over nearest neighbors. Let $T$ be the temperature and define $K = J/(k_{B}T)$. Focus on the thermodynamic limit of an infinite lattice.

It concerns canonical models and results in the study of phase transitions and low-dimensional systems.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested. The first part derives the expression for the spontaneous magnetization of the two-dimensional Ising model. The second part contrasts this result with the behavior of the two-dimensional XY model, explaining the absence of long-range order in the latter case.\n\n**Part 1: Spontaneous Magnetization of the 2D Ising Model**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the two-dimensional square-lattice Ising ferromagnet is given by $H = -J \\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle} \\sigma_{i}\\sigma_{j}$, where $\\sigma_i = \\pm 1$ are spin variables on lattice sites $i$, $J > 0$ is the ferromagnetic coupling constant, and the sum is over all pairs of nearest-neighbor sites.\n\nThe spontaneous magnetization, $M(T)$, is the order parameter for the ferromagnetic phase transition. It is defined as the average magnetization per site in the thermodynamic limit, in the presence of an infinitesimal external magnetic field $h$ that is taken to zero *after* the thermodynamic limit. This procedure selects one of the degenerate ground states below the critical temperature.\n$$M(T) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^{+}} \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\langle \\sigma_i \\rangle_h$$\nDue to translational invariance, $\\langle \\sigma_i \\rangle_h$ is independent of the site $i$, so $M(T) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^{+}} \\langle \\sigma_0 \\rangle_h$, where $\\sigma_0$ is the spin at an arbitrary origin site.\n\nA key concept in ordered phases is the cluster decomposition property. For a system in a pure thermodynamic phase (as selected by the $h \\to 0^+$ limit), the correlation between distant variables decays to the product of their expectation values:\n$$\\lim_{|\\vec{r}_i - \\vec{r}_j| \\to \\infty} \\langle \\sigma_i \\sigma_j \\rangle = \\langle \\sigma_i \\rangle \\langle \\sigma_j \\rangle$$\nIn our case, this implies:\n$$M(T)^2 = \\langle \\sigma_0 \\rangle^2 = \\lim_{|\\vec{r}| \\to \\infty} \\langle \\sigma_0 \\sigma_{\\vec{r}} \\rangle$$\nTherefore, the problem of calculating the spontaneous magnetization is equivalent to calculating the two-point correlation function in the limit of infinite separation.\n\nThe critical temperature, $T_c$, of the model can be found via the Kramers-Wannier duality. The partition function on the square lattice at a dimensionless inverse temperature $K = J/(k_B T)$ is related to the partition function on a dual square lattice at a dual temperature $K^*$ by the relation $\\sinh(2K)\\sinh(2K^*) = 1$. A phase transition, being a non-analyticity in the free energy, can only occur if the system is self-dual, i.e., $K = K^*$. This condition, $K_c = K^*_c$, immediately leads to:\n$$\\sinh^2(2K_c) = 1 \\implies \\sinh(2K_c) = 1$$\nThe solution for the critical coupling is $2K_c = \\operatorname{arsinh}(1) = \\ln(1 + \\sqrt{2})$, so $K_c = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(1+\\sqrt{2})$. The critical temperature is thus:\n$$T_c = \\frac{J}{k_B K_c} = \\frac{2J}{k_B \\ln(1+\\sqrt{2})}$$\nA spontaneously ordered phase with $M(T) > 0$ exists for temperatures $T  T_c$, which corresponds to $K > K_c$ or $\\sinh(2K) > 1$.\n\nThe calculation of correlation functions for the 2D Ising model is a landmark achievement of statistical mechanics, initiated by Onsager and Kaufman. They demonstrated that the problem can be mapped to one of non-interacting fermions, and correlation functions can be expressed in terms of Pfaffians or, more commonly, determinants of large matrices. For two spins $\\sigma_{0,0}$ and $\\sigma_{m,n}$ separated by $m$ sites horizontally and $n$ sites vertically, $\\langle \\sigma_{0,0} \\sigma_{m,n} \\rangle$ is given by the determinant of a block Toeplitz matrix.\n\nThe task of evaluating the limit of this determinant for infinite separation was first solved by C. N. Yang. The specific result for the row correlation function $\\langle \\sigma_{0,0} \\sigma_{m,0} \\rangle$ in the limit $m \\to \\infty$ gives precisely the square of the spontaneous magnetization. The result of this highly non-trivial calculation is remarkably compact. For $T  T_c$, the limit is non-zero and is given by:\n$$M(T)^2 = \\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\langle \\sigma_{0,0} \\sigma_{m,0} \\rangle = \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\sinh(2K) \\sinh(2K^*) \\right)^{-2} \\right]^{1/4}$$\nUsing the duality relation $\\sinh(2K^*) = 1/\\sinh(2K)$, this simplifies to:\n$$M(T)^2 = \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\sinh(2K) \\right)^{-4} \\right]^{1/4}$$\nTaking the square root for the magnetization $M(T)$ (which is positive by convention) and substituting back $K=J/(k_B T)$, we obtain the final expression for the spontaneous magnetization for $T  T_c$:\n$$M(T) = \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\sinh\\left(\\frac{2J}{k_B T}\\right) \\right)^{-4} \\right]^{1/8}$$\nThis expression correctly captures the physics: as $T \\to 0$, $K \\to \\infty$, $\\sinh(2K) \\to \\infty$, and $M(T) \\to 1$, corresponding to a fully ordered ground state. As $T \\to T_c^-$, $K \\to K_c^+$, $\\sinh(2K) \\to 1^+$, and $M(T) \\to 0$, showing that the magnetization vanishes continuously at the critical point. For $T > T_c$, $\\sinh(2K)  1$, the expression becomes complex, reflecting that the spontaneous magnetization is zero in the disordered phase.\n\n**Part 2: Absence of Magnetization in the 2D XY Model**\n\nIn contrast to the Ising model with its discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry ($\\sigma_i \\to -\\sigma_i$), the planar-rotor or XY model possesses a continuous symmetry. Its spins are two-component vectors of unit length, $\\vec{s}_i = (\\cos\\theta_i, \\sin\\theta_i)$, and its Hamiltonian is $H = -J \\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle} \\vec{s}_i \\cdot \\vec{s}_j = -J \\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle} \\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$. The symmetry group is the continuous group $O(2)$.\n\nThe Mermin-Wagner theorem states that in dimensions $d \\le 2$, a system with a continuous symmetry cannot spontaneously break that symmetry at any finite temperature $T > 0$. We can understand this for the 2D XY model by examining the effect of long-wavelength thermal fluctuations.\n\nLet us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that for some temperature $T > 0$, there is a spontaneous magnetization $\\langle \\vec{s}_i \\rangle = \\vec{M} \\neq \\vec{0}$. We can align our coordinate system such that $\\vec{M} = (M, 0)$ with $M > 0$. This implies that the spin angles $\\theta_i$ are, on average, oriented around $\\theta=0$.\n\nAccording to Goldstone's theorem, the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry results in the appearance of massless, gapless excitations known as Goldstone modes. In this case, these modes correspond to long-wavelength, low-energy fluctuations of the spin direction, i.e., slow spatial variations of the angle field $\\theta(\\vec{x})$.\n\nFor such low-energy fluctuations, the difference $(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$ is small, so we can approximate the cosine term in the Hamiltonian: $\\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j) \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)^2$. In the continuum limit, where $\\theta_i \\to \\theta(\\vec{x})$ and $(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)^2 \\approx (a\\nabla\\theta)^2$ (with $a$ being the lattice constant), the effective energy for these spin-wave excitations is:\n$$E_{eff} \\approx \\frac{J}{2} \\int (\\nabla\\theta(\\vec{x}))^2 d^2x$$\nWriting the angle field in terms of its Fourier modes, $\\theta(\\vec{x}) = \\sum_{\\vec{q}} \\theta_{\\vec{q}} e^{i\\vec{q}\\cdot\\vec{x}}$, the energy becomes $E_{eff} \\approx \\frac{J A}{2} \\sum_{\\vec{q}} q^2 |\\theta_{\\vec{q}}|^2$, where $A$ is the area of the system.\n\nAccording to the equipartition theorem, each quadratic mode in the energy has an average thermal energy of $\\frac{1}{2}k_B T$. This implies:\n$$\\frac{J A}{2} q^2 \\langle |\\theta_{\\vec{q}}|^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T \\implies \\langle |\\theta_{\\vec{q}}|^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T}{J A q^2}$$\nNow, we calculate the mean square fluctuation of the angle at a single point (e.g., the origin, $\\vec{x}=\\vec{0}$):\n$$\\langle \\theta(\\vec{0})^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{\\vec{q}} \\langle |\\theta_{\\vec{q}}|^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{A} \\sum_{\\vec{q}} \\frac{k_B T}{J q^2}$$\nIn the thermodynamic limit ($A \\to \\infty$), the sum over wavevectors becomes an integral: $\\frac{1}{A}\\sum_{\\vec{q}} \\to \\int \\frac{d^2q}{(2\\pi)^2}$.\n$$\\langle \\theta(\\vec{0})^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T}{J} \\int \\frac{d^2q}{(2\\pi)^2 q^2}$$\nSwitching to polar coordinates in $\\vec{q}$-space, $d^2q = 2\\pi q dq$, the integral becomes:\n$$\\langle \\theta(\\vec{0})^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T}{J} \\int_{q_{min}}^{q_{max}} \\frac{2\\pi q dq}{(2\\pi)^2 q^2} = \\frac{k_B T}{2\\pi J} \\int_{q_{min}}^{q_{max}} \\frac{dq}{q} = \\frac{k_B T}{2\\pi J} \\left[ \\ln(q) \\right]_{q_{min}}^{q_{max}}$$\nThe upper cutoff $q_{max} \\sim 1/a$ is related to the lattice spacing, while the lower cutoff $q_{min} \\sim 1/L$ is related to the system size $L$. As we take the thermodynamic limit $L \\to \\infty$, we have $q_{min} \\to 0$. The integral $\\int (1/q) dq$ exhibits a logarithmic divergence at the lower limit $q \\to 0$. This is known as an infrared divergence.\n\nThe result is that $\\langle \\theta(\\vec{0})^2 \\rangle \\to \\infty$. The fluctuations in the spin angle at any given site are infinite. An infinite fluctuation in the angle means the spin direction is completely randomized over all possible angles from $0$ to $2\\pi$. Consequently, the average value of any component of the spin must be zero:\n$$\\langle \\cos\\theta \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\langle \\sin\\theta \\rangle = 0$$\nThis implies that the magnetization $M$ is zero. This contradicts our initial assumption that $M > 0$. The assumption of an ordered state is therefore untenable at any $T > 0$. The proliferation of low-energy Goldstone modes destabilizes and destroys any potential long-range order.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the Ising model. Its discrete symmetry means that creating an excitation requires flipping a spin, which costs a finite amount of energy (an energy gap). There are no gapless Goldstone modes, so the long-wavelength fluctuations are not powerful enough to destroy the ordered state below $T_c$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left[ 1 - \\left( \\sinh\\left(\\frac{2J}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\right)^{-4} \\right]^{1/8}}$$", "id": "3004730"}, {"introduction": "The Mermin-Wagner theorem forbids true long-range order in the 2D XY model, but this opens the door to a more subtle and fascinating low-temperature phase governed by topological defects.

The beta function describes how the coupling constant changes with the length scale.\n\nThe derivation of the beta function for the $O(N)$ NLSM is a standard but subtle calculation in quantum field theory. A full derivation from first principles requires a careful application of the background field method, accounting for the geometry of the target space manifold, which is the $(N-1)$-sphere $S^{N-1}$. Rather than reproducing the entire complex derivation, we state the well-established one-loop result and provide its physical basis.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling $g$ in the $d=2$ $O(N)$ NLSM is given by:\n$$\\beta(g) = \\frac{dg}{d\\ln\\mu} = -\\frac{N-2}{2\\pi}g^2$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the momentum (energy) scale. The coefficient $N-2$ is crucial; it reflects the number of transverse Goldstone modes that dominate the low-energy fluctuations. For $N=2$ (the XY model), the target space $S^1$ is flat (zero curvature), and the one-loop beta function vanishes, leading to the distinct physics of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. For $N2$, the target space is curved, leading to interactions between the Goldstone modes and a non-zero beta function.\n\nFor the $O(3)$ model relevant to the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we have $N=3$.

Conversely, the coupling increases as the energy scale decreases (i.e., as the length scale increases), leading to strong coupling at low energies.\n\n**Step 3: Integration of the RG Flow and Correlation Length**\n\nWe now integrate the RG flow equation to find the relationship between the coupling and the scale. The flow equation is:\n$$\\frac{dg}{g^2} = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi} d\\ln\\mu$$\nWe integrate from the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff scale $\\Lambda$, corresponding to the lattice spacing $a$ (i.e., $\\Lambda \\sim 1/a$), down to a lower momentum scale $\\mu$. The coupling at the cutoff scale is the bare coupling $g(\\Lambda) = g_0 = T/\\rho_s$.\n$$\\int_{g_0}^{g(\\mu)} \\frac{dg'}{(g')^2} = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\Lambda}^{\\mu} d\\ln\\mu'$$\n$$\\left[ -\\frac{1}{g'} \\right]_{g_0}^{g(\\mu)} = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\ln\\mu' \\right]_{\\Lambda}^{\\mu}$$\n$$-\\frac{1}{g(\\mu)} + \\frac{1}{g_0} = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\Lambda}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\mu}\\right)$$\n\nThe correlation length $\\xi(T)$ is defined as the characteristic length scale at which the system enters a strong-coupling regime, where the perturbative RG treatment breaks down. This occurs at a momentum scale $\\mu_\\xi \\sim 1/\\xi$. At this scale, the effective coupling $g(\\mu_\\xi)$ becomes of order unity. Let's denote this critical coupling value by $g_c$. Substituting $\\mu = 1/\\xi$ and $g(1/\\xi) = g_c$:\n$$-\\frac{1}{g_c} + \\frac{1}{g_0} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln(\\Lambda\\xi)$$\nSubstituting $g_0 = T/\\rho_s$:\n$$\\frac{\\rho_s}{T} - \\frac{1}{g_c} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln(\\Lambda\\xi)$$\nWe are interested in the low-temperature limit, where $T \\ll \\rho_s$. In this limit, the bare coupling $g_0 = T/\\rho_s$ is small, and the term $\\rho_s/T$ is much larger than the constant $1/g_c$. Thus, we can approximate:\n$$\\frac{\\rho_s}{T} \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln(\\Lambda\\xi)$$\nSolving for the correlation length $\\xi$:\n$$\\ln(\\Lambda\\xi) \\approx \\frac{2\\pi\\rho_s}{T}$$\n$$\\Lambda\\xi \\approx \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\rho_s}{T}\\right)$$\n$$\\xi(T) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\Lambda} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\rho_s}{T}\\right)$$\n\nTo obtain the reduced correlation length $\\xi/a$, we use the relation between the UV cutoff $\\Lambda$ and the lattice spacing $a$. The cutoff is of the order of the inverse lattice spacing, $\\Lambda = C_0/a$, where $C_0$ is a non-universal constant of order one that depends on the specific geometry of the lattice and the choice of the cutoff scheme.\n$$\\frac{\\xi(T)}{a} \\approx \\frac{1}{C_0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\rho_s}{T}\\right)$$\nThe expression contains a non-universal prefactor. The problem requests a single closed-form expression. The most essential physical content, representing the low-temperature growth, is the exponential term. The prefactor depends on scheme choices (e.g., the precise value for $C_0$ and $g_c$) not specified in the problem. A standard practice in such theoretical problems is to present the result with the prefactor set to unity, which amounts to a specific choice of scheme or a re-scaling of the reference lattice constant $a$. Adopting this convention provides the definitive form for the functional dependence.\n\nThus, the low-temperature growth of the reduced correlation length is given by:\n$$\\frac{\\xi(T)}{a} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\rho_s}{T}\\right)$$\nThis result shows that the correlation length diverges exponentially as $T \\to 0$, a hallmark of systems near a quantum critical point in $d=2$. This behavior is consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which forbids long-range order at any $T0$, but allows for a diverging correlation length as the ordered ground state is approached.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\rho_s}{T}\\right)}$$", "id": "3004670"}]}
