The task is to derive the impurity contribution to resistivity in the low-temperature Kondo regime.\n\nThe solution is constructed by combining the Drude model of conductivity with the quantum mechanical theory of scattering.\n\nFirst, we begin with the provided givens. The impurity contribution to the electrical resistivity, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}$, is related to the momentum relaxation time due to impurity scattering, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}$, by the Drude formula:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T) = \\frac{m}{n e^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T)}\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the quasiparticle effective mass, $n$ is the conduction electron density, and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThe momentum relaxation rate, $1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T)$, for elastic scattering from a dilute concentration $n_i$ of random impurities is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T)} = n_i v_F \\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}}(T)\n$$\nHere, $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}}(T)$ is the transport cross section evaluated at the Fermi surface. The temperature dependence arises from the energy dependence of the scattering phase shifts near the Fermi surface, as captured by the temperature-dependent phase shift $\\delta_0(T)$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the relaxation rate into the Drude formula gives the resistivity in terms of the transport cross section:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T) = \\frac{m n_i v_F}{n e^2} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}}(T)\n$$\n\nNext, we must express the transport cross section in terms of the scattering phase shifts. According to partial-wave analysis, the transport cross section for elastic scattering is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\frac{4\\pi}{k^2} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l - \\delta_{l+1})\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the wave number of the scattered particle and $\\delta_l$ are the phase shifts for each angular momentum channel $l$. In this problem, scattering occurs at the Fermi surface, so we set $k = k_F$.\n\nThe problem states that at low temperatures, the scattering is dominated by the isotropic $s$-wave channel. This corresponds to the $l=0$ partial wave. We therefore set all other phase shifts to zero: $\\delta_l = 0$ for $l \\geq 1$. The summation for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ simplifies considerably:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\frac{4\\pi}{k_F^2} \\left( (0+1)\\sin^2(\\delta_0 - \\delta_1) + (1+1)\\sin^2(\\delta_1 - \\delta_2) + \\dots \\right)\n$$\nWith $\\delta_1 = \\delta_2 = \\dots = 0$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}}(T) = \\frac{4\\pi}{k_F^2} \\sin^2(\\delta_0(T) - 0) = \\frac{4\\pi}{k_F^2} \\sin^2(\\delta_0(T))\n$$\nThe temperature dependence of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ is carried by the $s$-wave phase shift $\\delta_0(T)$ at the Fermi surface.\n\nWe can now write the impurity resistivity explicitly in terms of the $s$-wave phase shift, as requested by the first part of the problem:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T) = \\frac{m n_i v_F}{n e^2} \\left[ \\frac{4\\pi}{k_F^2} \\sin^2(\\delta_0(T)) \\right]\n$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to evaluate this expression in the zero-temperature limit, $T \\to 0$. The problem provides the result from the Friedel sum rule for a fully screened spin-$1/2$ impurity, which states that the phase shift at the Fermi level approaches $\\pi/2$:\n$$\n\\lim_{T \\to 0} \\delta_0(T) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the resistivity gives the residual resistivity $\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(0)$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(0) = \\frac{4\\pi m n_i v_F}{n e^2 k_F^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$, the term $\\sin^2(\\pi/2) = 1$.

A resonant process occurs when the electron flips the impurity's spin to the excited state ($S^z=-1/2$). For example, a spin-down electron at energy $\\omega_1$ (relative to the Fermi level) scatters, flipping the impurity and leaving the conduction band in its ground state (e.g., the scattered electron emerges at the Fermi level).

Due to the spin-flipping Kondo interaction, there is a finite dynamic probability of finding the impurity in its excited state ($S^z=-1/2$). A resonant process can then occur where an incoming electron scatters and causes the impurity to de-excite back to its ground state ($S^z=+1/2$). For instance, a spin-up electron at energy $\\omega_2$ scatters, flipping the impurity spin down. By energy conservation:\n    $$\n    \\omega_2 + E_{\\downarrow} = E_{\\uparrow}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\omega_2 + \\frac{1}{2}g\\mu_B B = -\\frac{1}{2}g\\mu_B B \\implies \\omega_2 = -g\\mu_B B\n    $$\n    This process leads to a second peak in the spectral function at $\\omega_2 \\approx -g\\mu_B B$.\n\nThe energy splitting $\\Delta\\omega$ between these two maxima is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega = \\omega_1 - \\omega_2 = (g\\mu_B B) - (-g\\mu_B B) = 2g\\mu_B B\n$$\nThis result is the leading-order expression. We must now justify neglecting further corrections using the requested renormalization group (RG) reasoning.\n\nThe Kondo coupling $J$ is not a constant but a running coupling constant, $J(D)$, that depends on the energy scale or bandwidth cutoff $D$. For an antiferromagnetic interaction ($J0$), $J(D)$ increases as $D$ is lowered. The RG flow is described by the scaling equation (to one-loop):\n$$\n\\frac{dJ}{d\\ln D} \\approx -2\\rho J^2\n$$\nThe flow continues until it is cut off by the largest relevant energy scale, which could be temperature $T$, magnetic field $B$, or frequency $\\omega$. In the specified regime $B \\gtrsim T_K$ (and for low temperatures $T \\ll B$), the dominant infrared cutoff is the Zeeman energy, $g\\mu_B B$. The physical reason is that the spin-flip processes that drive the RG flow become energetically suppressed for virtual electron-hole pairs with energy less than the spin-flip cost $g\\mu_B B$. Therefore, the RG flow effectively stops at the scale $D \\approx g\\mu_B B$.\n\nThe bare result for the peak positions at $\\pm g\\mu_B B$ would be modified by the effective interaction at this scale, $J_{\\text{eff}} \\equiv J(D = g\\mu_B B)$.
