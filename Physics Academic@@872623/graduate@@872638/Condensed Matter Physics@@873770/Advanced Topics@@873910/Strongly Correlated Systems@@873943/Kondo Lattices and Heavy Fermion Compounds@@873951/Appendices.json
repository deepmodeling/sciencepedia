A Kondo insulator at half-filling has a fully filled lower hybridized band and an empty upper hybridized band at zero temperature, separated by the gap $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ind}}$. This system behaves like an intrinsic semiconductor. Electrical conduction requires thermal excitation of charge carriers (electrons and holes) across this gap. The number density of these carriers ($n_e$ for electrons, $n_h$ for holes) follows the law of mass action for an intrinsic semiconductor, which is dominated by a Boltzmann factor:\n$$\nn_e = n_h \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{act}}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $E_{\\mathrm{act}}$ is the activation energy. The resistivity $\\rho(T)$ is inversely proportional to the conductivity $\\sigma(T) = e(n_e\\mu_e + n_h\\mu_h)$, where $\\mu_e$ and $\\mu_h$ are the mobilities. Assuming mobilities are weakly temperature-dependent compared to the carrier densities, $\\rho(T)$ is dominated by the exponential term:\n$$\n\\rho(T) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma(T)} \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{act}}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe factor of $1/2$ in the activation exponent for resistivity arises from the position of the Fermi level, $\\epsilon_F$. In an intrinsic semiconductor (or a Kondo insulator at half-filling), the Fermi level lies approximately in the middle of the band gap. The top of the lower band is at $E_{-, \\max}$ and the bottom of the upper band is at $E_{+, \\min}$. Thus, $\\epsilon_F \\approx (E_{+, \\min} + E_{-, \\max})/2$. The minimum energy to create a free electron is the energy to excite it from the Fermi level to the bottom of the upper band, which is $E_{+, \\min} - \\epsilon_F$. Similarly, the energy to create a hole is $\\epsilon_F - E_{-, \\max}$. Both of these energies are approximately equal to half the full gap:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{act}} = E_{+, \\min} - \\epsilon_F \\approx E_{+, \\min} - \\frac{E_{+, \\min} + E_{-, \\max}}{2} = \\frac{E_{+, \\min} - E_{-, \\max}}{2} = \\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ind}}}{2}\n$$\nTherefore, the activation energy for carrier generation is half the indirect gap, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ind}}/2$. The functional form for the resistivity is:\n$$\n\\rho(T) = \\rho_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ind}}}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_0$ is a prefactor.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ind}}$ numerically using the derived formula and the given values $\\tilde V=28\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ and $W=0.65\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.
