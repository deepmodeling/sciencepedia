The condition $\\Delta_\\theta = \\Delta_0\\sin(2\\theta) \\neq 0$ holds for all incidence angles $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi/2)$. These angles correspond to a range of surface momenta $k_\\parallel = k_F \\sin\\theta$.\n\nThe dispersion relation $E(k_\\parallel)$ describes the energy of these bound states as a function of the momentum parallel to the surface. Since we found that the energy is $E=0$ for all allowed values of $k_\\parallel$ (i.e., for $k_\\parallel \\in (0, k_F)$), the dispersion relation is that of a flat band at the Fermi level.\nThe expression for the dispersion is therefore:\n$$ E(k_\\parallel) = 0 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3023173"}]}
