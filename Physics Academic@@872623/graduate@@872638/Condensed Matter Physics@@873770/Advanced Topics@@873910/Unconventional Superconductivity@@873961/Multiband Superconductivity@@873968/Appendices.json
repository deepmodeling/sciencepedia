Condensation Energy of the Coupled Multiband State ($\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}^{\\mathrm{multi}}$)**\n\nAt zero temperature, the condensation energy density $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}$ is the difference between the ground state energy densities of the superconducting ($\\mathcal{E}_S$) and normal ($\\mathcal{E}_N$) states. Within BCS mean-field theory, this can be expressed as a functional of the gap parameters $\\Delta_i$. The ground state corresponds to the values of $\\Delta_i$ that minimize this functional.\n\nThe condensation energy functional, representing $\\mathcal{E}_S - \\mathcal{E}_N$, for a two-band system is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}(\\{\\Delta_i\\}, \\mathbf{V}) = \\sum_{i=1,2} \\left[ 2 \\int_0^{\\omega_c} N_i(0) \\left( \\xi - \\sqrt{\\xi^2 + \\Delta_i^2} \\right) d\\xi \\right] + \\sum_{i,j=1,2} \\Delta_i (\\mathbf{V}^{-1})_{ij} \\Delta_j\n$$\nThe first term represents the change in kinetic energy of the electrons upon pairing, and the second term is the mean-field interaction energy contribution. We assume the gaps $\\Delta_i$ are real and positive.\n\nThe integral can be evaluated as:\n$$\n\\int_0^{\\omega_c} \\left( \\xi - \\sqrt{\\xi^2 + \\Delta_i^2} \\right) d\\xi = \\left[ \\frac{\\xi^2}{2} - \\frac{\\xi}{2}\\sqrt{\\xi^2 + \\Delta_i^2} - \\frac{\\Delta_i^2}{2}\\ln\\left(\\xi + \\sqrt{\\xi^2 + \\Delta_i^2}\\right) \\right]_0^{\\omega_c}\n$$\nIn the BCS limit, the cutoff energy $\\omega_c$ is much larger than the gaps, $\\omega_c \\gg \\Delta_i$. We approximate for large $\\xi$: $\\sqrt{\\xi^2 + \\Delta_i^2} \\approx \\xi(1 + \\frac{\\Delta_i^2}{2\\xi^2}) = \\xi + \\frac{\\Delta_i^2}{2\\xi}$ and $\\ln(\\xi + \\sqrt{\\xi^2 + \\Delta_i^2}) \\approx \\ln(2\\xi)$.\n$$\n\\approx \\left( \\frac{\\omega_c^2}{2} - \\frac{\\omega_c}{2}\\left(\\omega_c + \\frac{\\Delta_i^2}{2\\omega_c}\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta_i^2}{2}\\ln(2\\omega_c) \\right) - \\left( 0 - 0 - \\frac{\\Delta_i^2}{2}\\ln(\\Delta_i) \\right)\n= -\\frac{\\Delta_i^2}{4} - \\frac{\\Delta_i^2}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\omega_c}{\\Delta_i}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back, the kinetic energy contribution is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1,2} 2 N_i(0) \\left[ -\\frac{\\Delta_i^2}{4} - \\frac{\\Delta_i^2}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\omega_c}{\\Delta_i}\\right) \\right] = \\sum_{i=1,2} \\left[ -N_i(0)\\frac{\\Delta_i^2}{2} - N_i(0)\\Delta_i^2\\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\omega_c}{\\Delta_i}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe physical gaps $\\Delta_i$ are found by minimizing the energy functional, i.e., by solving the system of gap equations $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}}{\\partial \\Delta_k} = 0$ for $k=1,2$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Delta_k} \\left( 2 \\int_0^{\\omega_c} N_k(0) (\\xi - \\sqrt{\\xi^2 + \\Delta_k^2}) d\\xi \\right) = -2N_k(0)\\Delta_k \\int_0^{\\omega_c} \\frac{d\\xi}{\\sqrt{\\xi^2 + \\Delta_k^2}} \\approx -2N_k(0)\\Delta_k\\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\omega_c}{\\Delta_k}\\right)\n$$\nAnd for the interaction term (using the symmetry of $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}$):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Delta_k} \\left( \\sum_{i,j} \\Delta_i (\\mathbf{V}^{-1})_{ij} \\Delta_j \\right) = 2 \\sum_j (\\mathbf{V}^{-1})_{kj} \\Delta_j\n$$\nThe gap equations are therefore:\n$$\n-2N_k(0)\\Delta_k\\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\omega_c}{\\Delta_k}\\right) + 2 \\sum_j (\\mathbf{V}^{-1})_{kj} \\Delta_j = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\implies \\sum_j (\\mathbf{V}^{-1})_{kj} \\Delta_j = N_k(0)\\Delta_k\\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\omega_c}{\\Delta_k}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the self-consistency condition that must be satisfied by the physical gaps. The problem requires us to use this condition to eliminate $\\mathbf{V}$ and $\\omega_c$ from the expression for the condensation energy $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}^{\\mathrm{multi}}$, which is the value of the functional at this minimum.\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}^{\\mathrm{multi}} = \\sum_{i=1,2} \\left[ -N_i(0)\\frac{\\Delta_i^2}{2} - N_i(0)\\Delta_i^2\\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\omega_c}{\\Delta_i}\\right) \\right] + \\sum_{i,j} \\Delta_i (\\mathbf{V}^{-1})_{ij} \\Delta_j\n$$\nThe last term can be rewritten as $\\sum_i \\Delta_i \\left( \\sum_j (\\mathbf{V}^{-1})_{ij} \\Delta_j \\right)$. Using the gap equation, we substitute the expression for the inner sum:\n$$\n\\sum_i \\Delta_i \\left( N_i(0)\\Delta_i\\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\omega_c}{\\Delta_i}\\right) \\right) = \\sum_i N_i(0)\\Delta_i^2\\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\omega_c}{\\Delta_i}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}^{\\mathrm{multi}}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}^{\\mathrm{multi}} = \\sum_{i=1,2} \\left[ -N_i(0)\\frac{\\Delta_i^2}{2} - N_i(0)\\Delta_i^2\\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\omega_c}{\\Delta_i}\\right) \\right] + \\sum_{i=1,2} N_i(0)\\Delta_i^2\\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\omega_c}{\\Delta_i}\\right)\n$$\nThe logarithmic terms cancel out exactly.\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}^{\\mathrm{multi}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1,2} N_i(0)\\Delta_i^2\n$$\nThis is the condensation energy density of the coupled two-band system, expressed entirely in terms of the self-consistent gaps $\\Delta_i$ and the densities of states $N_i(0)$, as requested.\n\n**2.2. Condensation Energy of the Decoupled Reference State ($\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}^{\\mathrm{dec}}$)**\n\nThe problem defines the reference state as \"the sum of two independent single-band BCS superconductors\". This means we consider two separate systems.\n- System 1: A single-band superconductor with density of states $N_1(0)$.\n- System 2: A single-band superconductor with density of states $N_2(0)$.\n\nThe problem further states that these two systems are constructed to have the same gap magnitudes, $\\Delta_1$ and $\\Delta_2$, as the coupled system. For a standard single-band BCS superconductor (labeled by $i$), the condensation energy density at $T=0$ is a classic result:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}, i} = -\\frac{1}{2} N_i(0)\\Delta_i^2\n$$\nThe condensation energy density of the decoupled reference state, $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}^{\\mathrm{dec}}$, is simply the sum of the condensation energies of these two independent systems:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}^{\\mathrm{dec}} = \\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}, 1} + \\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}, 2} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}N_1(0)\\Delta_1^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}N_2(0)\\Delta_2^2\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}^{\\mathrm{dec}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1,2} N_i(0)\\Delta_i^2\n$$\n\n**2.3. The Difference in Condensation Energy Densities ($\\Delta \\mathcal{E}$)**\n\nThe final task is to compute the difference $\\Delta \\mathcal{E} = \\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}^{\\mathrm{multi}} - \\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{cond}}^{\\mathrm{dec}}$.\nUsing the results from the previous sections:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathcal{E} = \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1,2} N_i(0)\\Delta_i^2 \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1,2} N_i(0)\\Delta_i^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathcal{E} = 0\n$$\nThe result is zero. This demonstrates that, within the mean-field BCS framework, the condensation energy is a universal function of the self-consistent gap magnitudes and the densities of states, regardless of the a-priori structure of the pairing interaction matrix $\\mathbf{V}$ that gives rise to those gaps. All effects of the interband coupling are fully absorbed into the determination of the gap values themselves.

In the Born approximation for impurity scattering, assume the following minimal GL free-energy density functional:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F} = a_{1}|\\Delta_{1}|^{2} + \\frac{b_{1}}{2}|\\Delta_{1}|^{4} + a_{2}|\\Delta_{2}|^{2} + \\frac{b_{2}}{2}|\\Delta_{2}|^{4} - J\\,\\Re\\!\\left(\\Delta_{1}^{*}\\Delta_{2}\\right) + C\\,\\Gamma_{12}\\,|\\Delta_{1}-\\Delta_{2}|^{2},\n$$\nwhere $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}0$ are real GL coefficients and $J$ is the interband Josephson-like coupling originating from interband pair scattering in the clean system. The constant $C0$ encodes microscopic details of how interband nonmagnetic impurities mix the two condensates in the Born approximation. Take $J0$ so that, in the clean limit $\\Gamma_{12}=0$, the relative phase in the energetically preferred state is $\\pi$ (the so-called $s_{\\pm}$ state), and define the clean-limit magnitudes by $|\\Delta_{i}^{(0)}|=\\sqrt{-a_{i}/b_{i}}$.\n\nAs $\\Gamma_{12}$ increases, interband impurity scattering tends to align the phases and equalize the magnitudes of $\\Delta_{1}$ and $\\Delta_{2}$. Starting from first principles within the above GL framework and without invoking any pre-derived shortcut formulas, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the critical interband scattering rate $\\Gamma_{12}^{\\star}$ at which the ground-state relative phase switches from $\\pi$ to $0$ (a transition from $s_{\\pm}$ to $s_{++}$). You may treat the variation of $|\\Delta_{i}|$ with $\\Gamma_{12}$ as weak at the phase transition point and focus on the phase-selection mechanism. Express your final answer as a single analytic expression in terms of the model parameters $\\{J, C\\}$ only.
