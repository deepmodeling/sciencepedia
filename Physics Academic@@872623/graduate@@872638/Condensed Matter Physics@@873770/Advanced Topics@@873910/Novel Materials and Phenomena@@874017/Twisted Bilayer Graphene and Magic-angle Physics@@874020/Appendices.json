A non-zero intra-sublattice tunneling $w_0$ makes the velocity renormalization less effective. This means that to achieve the flat-band condition ($v^*=0$), a stronger effective interlayer coupling (a larger $\\alpha$) is required. Since $\\alpha$ is inversely proportional to the angle $\\theta$, a larger required $\\alpha$ implies a smaller magic angle. Thus, increasing the ratio $w_0/w_1$ from zero is predicted to decrease the magic angle.\n\n*   **Lattice Relaxation**: In a real system, the atoms relax to minimize energy. This leads to the expansion of energetically favorable AB/BA-stacked regions and the contraction of high-energy AA-stacked regions. The interlayer distance increases in the contracted AA regions, which exponentially suppresses the corresponding tunneling amplitude $w_0$. The AB/BA tunneling $w_1$ is less affected. Therefore, lattice relaxation significantly reduces the ratio $w_0/w_1$, driving the system closer to the chiral limit. Based on the argument above, a smaller $w_0/w_1$ ratio makes velocity renormalization more efficient, meaning a smaller value of $\\alpha$ is needed to achieve $v^*=0$. This implies a larger moiré wavelength and therefore a larger magic angle.
