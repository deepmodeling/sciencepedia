In linear response theory, the induced density is related to the external perturbation via the dielectric function of the electron gas, $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{q})$. An external point charge $Ze$ at the origin corresponds to an external charge density $\\rho_{ext}(\\mathbf{r}) = Ze\\delta(\\mathbf{r})$, whose Fourier transform is $\\rho_{ext}(\\mathbf{q}) = Ze$.\n\nThe induced charge density $\\rho_{ind}(\\mathbf{q})$ is related to the external charge density by\n$$ \\rho_{ind}(\\mathbf{q}) = \\rho_{ext}(\\mathbf{q}) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{q})} - 1 \\right) $$\nThe induced electron number density is $\\delta n(\\mathbf{q}) = \\rho_{ind}(\\mathbf{q}) / (-e)$. Substituting $\\rho_{ext}(\\mathbf{q}) = Ze$:\n$$ \\delta n(\\mathbf{q}) = \\frac{Ze}{-e} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{q})} - 1 \\right) = -Z \\frac{1-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{q})}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{q})} = Z \\frac{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{q}) - 1}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{q})} $$\nThe static dielectric function in the RPA is given by $\\epsilon_{RPA}(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega=0) = 1 - v_c(q) \\Pi_0(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega=0)$, where $v_c(q) = e^2/(\\epsilon_0 q^2)$ is the Fourier transform of the Coulomb potential and $\\Pi_0(\\mathbf{q}, 0)$ is the static non-interacting polarization function (the Lindhard function). $\\Pi_0(\\mathbf{q}, 0)$ is negative.\n\nThe real-space density perturbation is the inverse Fourier transform:\n$$ \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}) = \\int \\frac{d^3 q}{(2\\pi)^3} e^{i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}} \\delta n(\\mathbf{q}) $$\nThe asymptotic behavior of this integral for large $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$ is determined by the non-analytic features of the integrand, $\\delta n(\\mathbf{q})$, in the complex $q$-plane.\n\n**Thomas–Fermi (TF) Approximation**\nThe TF approximation consists of taking the long-wavelength limit ($q \\to 0$) of the polarization function. In this limit, $\\Pi_0(q,0) \\to \\Pi_0(0,0) = -e^2 D(E_F)$, where $D(E_F)$ is the density of states (including spin) at the Fermi energy.\nThe dielectric function becomes:\n$$ \\epsilon_{TF}(q) = 1 - v_c(q) \\Pi_0(0,0) = 1 - \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon_0 q^2} (-e^2 D(E_F)) = 1 + \\frac{e^4 D(E_F)}{\\epsilon_0 q^2} $$\nLet's use the susceptibility $\\chi_0 = \\Pi_0/e^2$ that connects density to potential energy. Then $\\epsilon=1-v_c e^2 \\chi_0 = 1 - \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon_0 q^2} \\chi_0$. For $q \\to 0$, $\\chi_0(0) = -D(E_F)$. So $\\epsilon_{TF}(q) = 1 + \\frac{e^2 D(E_F)}{\\epsilon_0 q^2} = 1 + \\frac{\\kappa^2}{q^2}$, where $\\kappa = \\sqrt{e^2 D(E_F)/\\epsilon_0}$ is the Thomas-Fermi screening wave number.\n\nThe induced density in this approximation is:\n$$ \\delta n_{TF}(q) = Z \\frac{\\epsilon_{TF}(q) - 1}{\\epsilon_{TF}(q)} = Z \\frac{\\kappa^2/q^2}{1 + \\kappa^2/q^2} = Z \\frac{\\kappa^2}{q^2 + \\kappa^2} $$\nTo find $\\delta n_{TF}(r)$, we compute the inverse Fourier transform:\n$$ \\delta n_{TF}(r) = \\int \\frac{d^3 q}{(2\\pi)^3} e^{i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}} Z \\frac{\\kappa^2}{q^2 + \\kappa^2} $$\nThis is a standard integral. The Fourier transform of the Yukawa potential $e^{-\\kappa r}/(4\\pi r)$ is $1/(q^2 + \\kappa^2)$. Therefore:\n$$ \\delta n_{TF}(r) = Z\\kappa^2 \\frac{e^{-\\kappa r}}{4\\pi r} $$\nThis function is a product of a decaying exponential and $1/r$. It is everywhere positive (for $Z0$, representing electron accumulation to screen the positive impurity), monotonically decreasing for $r0$, and shows no oscillations. The function decays as $\\propto e^{-\\kappa r}/r$.\n\n**Random Phase Approximation (RPA)**\nThe RPA retains the full $q$-dependence of the polarization function $\\Pi_0(q,0)$, which is the Lindhard function. For $T=0$, this function is:\n$$ \\Pi_0(q,0) = -e^2 D(E_F) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{4k_F^2 - q^2}{8k_F q} \\ln \\left| \\frac{2k_F + q}{2k_F - q} \\right| \\right] $$\nA key feature of the Lindhard function is that it is analytic for most values of $q$, but its derivative, $d\\Pi_0/dq$, has a logarithmic singularity at $q=2k_F$. This is a point of non-analyticity.\n\nThe asymptotic form of a Fourier transform for large $r$ is determined by the \"sharpest\" non-analytic feature of the function in $q$-space. While the TF approximation leads to a pole at $q = i\\kappa$, which gives the exponential decay, the full RPA denominator $\\epsilon_{RPA}(q)$ does not have poles on the imaginary axis that would give rise to such exponential decay. Instead, the dominant non-analytic feature is the singularity in the derivative of $\\Pi_0(q,0)$ at the real value $q=2k_F$.\nAccording to the theory of asymptotic Fourier transforms (e.g., Lighthill's theorem), a singularity of this type in the integrand leads to a real-space function that decays algebraically and oscillates. The specific asymptotic form is:\n$$ \\delta n_{RPA}(r) \\propto \\frac{\\cos(2k_F r + \\phi)}{r^3} \\quad \\text{as } r \\to \\infty $$\nThese oscillations are known as Friedel oscillations. They are a direct consequence of the sharp cutoff at the Fermi surface in the momentum distribution of a $T=0$ Fermi gas, which manifests as the non-analyticity in the response function at $q=2k_F$ (the diameter of the Fermi sphere).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In Thomas–Fermi, $\\delta n(r)$ is monotonic and decays as $\\propto e^{-\\kappa r}/r$ with screening wave number $\\kappa$, exhibiting no oscillations.**\nOur derivation for the TF approximation yielded $\\delta n_{TF}(r) = Z\\kappa^2 \\frac{e^{-\\kappa r}}{4\\pi r}$. This function is proportional to $e^{-\\kappa r}/r$. It is a monotonically decreasing function of $r$ (for $r  0$) and contains no oscillatory terms.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In Random Phase Approximation, $\\delta n(r)$ has an oscillatory algebraic tail $\\propto \\cos(2 k_{F} r + \\phi)/r^{3}$ determined by nonanalyticity of the static susceptibility at $q = 2 k_{F}$.**\nOur analysis of the RPA showed that the non-analyticity of the Lindhard function (static susceptibility) at $q=2k_F$ is the key feature determining the long-range behavior. This feature gives rise to the characteristic Friedel oscillations, which have an algebraic decay envelope of $1/r^3$ and an oscillatory component $\\cos(2k_F r + \\phi)$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. The absence of oscillations in Thomas–Fermi arises because it neglects the nonlocal wavevector dependence of the susceptibility, replacing it by its $q \\to 0$ value, thereby removing the singular structure near $q = 2 k_{F}$.**\nThe TF approximation explicitly replaces the full function $\\Pi_0(q,0)$ with its constant value at $q=0$, $\\Pi_0(0,0)$. This procedure completely discards the structure of the function at finite $q$, including the crucial non-analyticity at $q=2k_F$. Since this non-analyticity is the source of the Friedel oscillations, its removal in the TF model is precisely why that model fails to predict them.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In Random Phase Approximation, an exponential Yukawa decay always dominates the algebraic tail at large $r$, so oscillations are absent asymptotically.**\nThis statement is incorrect on two counts. First, an exponential decay term of the form $e^{-\\kappa r}$ decays faster than any algebraic term like $1/r^3$ for large $r$. Thus, the algebraic tail would dominate asymptotically, not the other way around. Second, and more fundamentally, within the static RPA for a $3$D electron gas, the dielectric function $\\epsilon_{RPA}(q)$ has no zeros on the imaginary $q$-axis, which means there is no pole in $1/\\epsilon_{RPA}(q)$ that would generate a Yukawa-type exponential decay. The asymptotic behavior is purely algebraic.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. In Thomas–Fermi theory, even for a point charge, the far-field induced density is dominated by a non-oscillatory term $\\propto 1/r^{3}$ rather than an exponential.**\nOur derivation explicitly showed that the TF induced density is $\\delta n_{TF}(r) \\propto e^{-\\kappa r}/r$. This is a Yukawa-type exponential decay, not an algebraic decay of the form $1/r^3$. The $1/r^3$ decay is characteristic of the RPA, not TF.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "3013482"}, {"introduction": "Beyond describing screening, the RPA can be used to predict macroscopic thermodynamic properties of an electron gas, such as its compressibility.
