It is a standard derivation in condensed matter physics. We proceed with the solution, which is divided into three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the thermodynamic derivative $\\partial n / \\partial \\mu$**\n\nWe begin by calculating the particle number density $n$ of a three-dimensional homogeneous electron gas at zero temperature. At $T=0$, all single-particle states with wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ such that the energy $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}) \\le \\mu = \\epsilon_F$ are occupied. The states form a sphere in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, known as the Fermi sphere, with radius $k_F$.\n\nThe volume of an elementary cell in $\\mathbf{k}$-space for a system of volume $V$ is $(2\\pi)^3/V$. Each such cell can hold two electrons due to spin degeneracy ($g_s=2$). Thus, the density of states in $\\mathbf{k}$-space is $2V/(2\\pi)^3$.\n\nThe total number of electrons, $N$, is found by integrating this density over the volume of the Fermi sphere:\n$$\nN = \\left( \\frac{2V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\right) \\times (\\text{Volume of Fermi sphere}) = \\frac{2V}{8\\pi^3} \\left( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3 \\right) = V \\frac{k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}\n$$\nThe particle number density $n$ is $N/V$, so we have:\n$$\nn = \\frac{k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}\n$$\nThe problem requires the derivative $\\partial n / \\partial \\mu$. To compute this, we first express $n$ as a function of the chemical potential $\\mu$. At $T=0$, the chemical potential is equal to the Fermi energy, $\\mu = \\epsilon_F$. We are given the dispersion relation $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}) = \\hbar^2 k^2 / (2m)$, which implies:\n$$\n\\mu = \\epsilon_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m}\n$$\nWe can solve this for $k_F$:\n$$\nk_F^2 = \\frac{2m\\mu}{\\hbar^2} \\implies k_F = \\left( \\frac{2m\\mu}{\\hbar^2} \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $k_F$ into the equation for the density $n$:\n$$\nn(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{3\\pi^2} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{2m\\mu}{\\hbar^2} \\right)^{1/2} \\right]^3 = \\frac{1}{3\\pi^2} \\left( \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\right)^{3/2} \\mu^{3/2}\n$$\nNow we can differentiate $n$ with respect to $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\left[ \\frac{1}{3\\pi^2} \\left( \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\right)^{3/2} \\mu^{3/2} \\right] = \\frac{1}{3\\pi^2} \\left( \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\right)^{3/2} \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\mu^{1/2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2} \\frac{(2m)^{3/2}}{\\hbar^3} \\mu^{1/2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for this quantity to be expressed in terms of $m$, $k_F$, and $\\hbar$. We substitute $\\mu^{1/2} = (\\epsilon_F)^{1/2} = \\hbar k_F / \\sqrt{2m}$ back into the expression:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2} \\frac{(2m)^{3/2}}{\\hbar^3} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar k_F}{\\sqrt{2m}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2} \\frac{2m \\cdot \\sqrt{2m}}{\\hbar^3} \\frac{\\hbar k_F}{\\sqrt{2m}} = \\frac{2m k_F}{2\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the first result:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{m k_F}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}\n$$\nThis quantity is the thermodynamic density of states per unit volume at the Fermi level.\n\n**Part 2: Expression for the Thomas-Fermi screening wavevector $q_{\\mathrm{TF}}^{2}$**\n\nThe problem provides the definition of the Thomas-Fermi screening wavevector squared, $q_{\\mathrm{TF}}^{2}$:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{TF}}^{2} = \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu}\n$$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge magnitude and $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.\nWe substitute the result from Part 1 into this definition:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{TF}}^{2} = \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{m k_F}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2} \\right)\n$$\nThis gives the closed-form expression for $q_{\\mathrm{TF}}^{2}$ in terms of the specified constants and parameters:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{TF}}^{2} = \\frac{e^2 m k_F}{\\epsilon_0 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Relation between $q_{\\mathrm{TF}}^{2}$ and the Lindhard function $\\chi_{0}(0,0)$**\n\nWe are given the linear response relation $\\delta n(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega) = \\chi_{0}(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega) \\delta U(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega)$, which defines the non-interacting density response function $\\chi_{0}$. We need to find the specific limit for a static ($\\omega=0$) and uniform ($\\mathbf{q} \\to \\mathbf{0}$) external potential, $\\delta U$.\n\nConsider a static, spatially uniform potential $\\delta U$. This potential simply shifts the energy of every single-electron state by a constant amount $\\delta U$. The system is in equilibrium with a particle reservoir at a fixed chemical potential $\\mu$. In the presence of the potential $\\delta U$, the local electron density $n$ is determined by the local value of the electrochemical potential. In our homogeneous system, the condition for equilibrium is that the electron's total energy, which is its kinetic plus potential energy, relative to the chemical potential $\\mu$, remains the same. A potential $\\delta U$ effectively shifts the chemical potential felt by the electrons from $\\mu$ to $\\mu - \\delta U$.\n\nThe new density $n'$ is given by the equation of state $n(\\mu - \\delta U)$. The change in density, $\\delta n$, is:\n$$\n\\delta n = n' - n = n(\\mu - \\delta U) - n(\\mu)\n$$\nFor a weak potential, we can perform a Taylor expansion of $n(\\mu - \\delta U)$ around $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\delta n \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu} \\right) (-\\delta U) = - \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu} \\delta U\n$$\nThis relation holds in the static, uniform limit. Comparing this with the definition provided in Fourier space, $\\delta n = \\chi_0(0,0) \\delta U$, we can identify:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}(0,0) = - \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu}\n$$\nThe sign of this relation can be determined from first principles. The quantity $\\partial n / \\partial \\mu$ represents the change in density with respect to the chemical potential. For a stable thermodynamic system, increasing the chemical potential (the energy to add a particle) must allow the system to accommodate more particles, so density increases. Thus, $\\partial n / \\partial \\mu > 0$. Our result from Part 1, $\\frac{m k_F}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}$, is manifestly positive. The response function $\\chi_{0}$ relates the change in density to a potential. A positive external potential $\\delta U > 0$ is repulsive to electrons (charge $-e$), so it will lower the electron density, meaning $\\delta n  0$. Since $\\delta n = \\chi_0 \\delta U$, and $\\delta n$ and $\\delta U$ have opposite signs, $\\chi_0$ must be negative. The relationship $\\chi_{0}(0,0) = - (\\partial n / \\partial \\mu)$ is therefore consistent, with a negative sign connecting the two positive/negative quantities.\n\nNow we can relate $q_{\\mathrm{TF}}^{2}$ to $\\chi_0(0,0)$. From the expression above, we have $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu} = - \\chi_0(0,0)$. Substituting this into the definition of $q_{\\mathrm{TF}}^{2}$ from Part 2:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{TF}}^{2} = \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\left( - \\chi_0(0,0) \\right)\n$$\nThis gives the final relation:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{TF}}^{2} = - \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\chi_0(0,0)\n$$\n\nThe final answer consists of the two requested expressions.\n1.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires us to analyze the nonanalytic behavior of the interacting static density response function, $\\chi(q)$, and relate it to the amplitude of Friedel oscillations.\n\nThe given response function is:\n$$\n\\chi(q) = \\frac{\\Pi_{0}(q)}{1 - v_{q}\\,\\bigl(1 - G(q)\\bigr)\\,\\Pi_{0}(q)}\n$$\nwhere $\\Pi_{0}(q)$ is the static ($\\omega=0$) Lindhard function. The problem states that $\\Pi_{0}(q)$ has a nonanalytic point at $q = 2k_F$. We can formally decompose $\\Pi_{0}(q)$ in the vicinity of $q_0 = 2k_F$ into a regular part, $\\Pi_{0,R}(q)$, and a nonanalytic part, $\\delta\\Pi_{0}(q)$:\n$$\n\\Pi_{0}(q) = \\Pi_{0,R}(q) + \\delta\\Pi_{0}(q)\n$$\nThe regular part $\\Pi_{0,R}(q)$ is an analytic function near $q=2k_F$, and its value at this point is simply the value of the full function, $\\Pi_{0,R}(2k_F) = \\Pi_{0}(2k_F, 0)$, since the nonanalytic part $\\delta\\Pi_0(q)$ vanishes as $q \\to 2k_F$.

Let's define the function $f(x)$ and the parameter $A(q)$ as:\n$$\nA(q) = v_q (1-G(q))\n$$\n$$\n\\chi(q) = f(\\Pi_0(q)) = \\frac{\\Pi_0(q)}{1 - A(q)\\Pi_0(q)}\n$$\nThe terms $v_q$ and $G(q)$ are assumed to be analytic functions at $q=2k_F$. Therefore, the parameter $A(q)$ is also analytic at $q=2k_F$. The nonanalyticity in $\\chi(q)$ arises solely from the nonanalyticity in $\\Pi_{0}(q)$.\n\nWe can find the nonanalytic part of $\\chi(q)$, which we denote $\\delta\\chi(q)$, by performing a functional Taylor expansion of $\\chi(q)$ with respect to the small nonanalytic part $\\delta\\Pi_0(q)$.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe retarded density-density response function for a non-interacting electron gas at temperature $T=0$ is given by\n$$\n\\chi_{0}^{R}(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)=2\\int \\frac{d^{3}k}{(2\\pi)^{3}}\\,\\frac{f(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}})-f(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}})}{\\hbar\\omega+i0^{+}+\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}-\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}}}\n$$\nAt $T=0$, the Fermi-Dirac distribution is a step function, $f(\\varepsilon) = \\Theta(\\varepsilon_F - \\varepsilon)$, where $\\varepsilon_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2k_F^2}{2m}$ is the Fermi energy.\n\nIn the long-wavelength limit, $q \\ll k_F$, we can expand the energy difference:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (k^2 - |\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}|^2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (k^2 - (k^2 + 2\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{q} + q^2)) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{m}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{q} - \\frac{\\hbar^2q^2}{2m}\n$$\nSince the integral is dominated by states near the Fermi surface ($k \\approx k_F$), the term linear in $q$ is much larger than the term quadratic in $q$. We retain the leading order term:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}} \\approx -\\frac{\\hbar^2\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{q}}{m} = -\\hbar \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\cdot\\mathbf{q}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\hbar\\mathbf{k}/m$ is the electron velocity.\n\nThe numerator $f(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}})-f(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}})$ is non-zero only when $\\mathbf{k}$ is in a narrow region around the Fermi surface. For small $q$, we can approximate this difference as:\n$$\nf(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}})-f(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}}) \\approx -(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}}-\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}})\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\varepsilon}\\bigg|_{\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}}\n$$\nAt $T=0$, the derivative of the Fermi function is a delta function, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\varepsilon} = -\\delta(\\varepsilon-\\varepsilon_F)$. Substituting this and the energy expansion, we get:\n$$\nf(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}})-f(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}}) \\approx -(\\hbar \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\cdot\\mathbf{q})(-\\delta(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}-\\varepsilon_F)) = \\hbar \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\cdot\\mathbf{q}\\,\\delta(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}-\\varepsilon_F)\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the expression for $\\chi_{0}^{R}(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega)$:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}^{R}(\\mathbf{q},\\omega) \\approx 2\\int \\frac{d^{3}k}{(2\\pi)^{3}}\\,\\frac{\\hbar \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\cdot\\mathbf{q}\\,\\delta(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}-\\varepsilon_F)}{\\hbar\\omega+i0^{+} - \\hbar \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\cdot\\mathbf{q}}\n$$\nWe can rewrite the integral over $\\mathbf{k}$ as an integral over energy and solid angle. The expression $2 \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} \\delta(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\varepsilon_F)$ is the definition of the density of states at the Fermi level per unit volume, including spin degeneracy, which is denoted by $N_0$. This allows us to write the response function as an average over the Fermi surface:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}^{R}(\\mathbf{q},\\omega) \\approx N_0 \\int \\frac{d\\Omega_{\\mathbf{k}}}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\cdot\\mathbf{q}}{\\omega+i0^{+} - \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\cdot\\mathbf{q}}\n$$\nHere, the integral is over the solid angle of vectors $\\mathbf{k}$ on the Fermi surface, where $|\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}}|=v_F$.\nLet's align the $z$-axis with $\\mathbf{q}$, so that $\\mathbf{q}=q\\hat{z}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\cdot\\mathbf{q} = v_F q \\cos\\theta$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}^{R}(q,\\omega) \\approx N_0 \\frac{2\\pi}{4\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi d\\theta \\sin\\theta \\frac{v_Fq\\cos\\theta}{\\omega+i0^{+} - v_Fq\\cos\\theta}\n$$\nLet $x = \\cos\\theta$, so $dx = -\\sin\\theta d\\theta$:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}^{R}(q,\\omega) \\approx \\frac{N_0}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} dx \\frac{v_F q x}{\\omega+i0^{+} - v_F q x}\n$$\nThe integrand can be simplified: $\\frac{v_F q x}{\\omega - v_F q x} = \\frac{-(\\omega - v_F q x) + \\omega}{\\omega - v_F q x} = -1 + \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega - v_F q x}$.\nPerforming the integral:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}^{R}(q,\\omega) \\approx \\frac{N_0}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left( \\frac{\\omega+i0^{+}}{\\omega+i0^{+} - v_F q x} - 1 \\right) dx\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{N_0}{2} \\left[ (\\omega+i0^{+})\\left(-\\frac{1}{v_Fq}\\ln(\\omega+i0^{+} - v_Fqx)\\right) - x \\right]_{-1}^{1}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{N_0}{2} \\left[ -\\frac{\\omega+i0^{+}}{v_Fq} \\left( \\ln(\\omega-v_Fq+i0^{+}) - \\ln(\\omega+v_Fq+i0^{+}) \\right) - 2 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= -N_0 + N_0 \\frac{\\omega+i0^{+}}{2v_Fq} \\ln\\left( \\frac{\\omega+v_Fq+i0^{+}}{\\omega-v_Fq+i0^{+}} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $q \\ll k_F$. We are asked to evaluate it in the \"hydrodynamic\" limit $\\omega \\ll v_F q$, which means the parameter $u = \\omega/(v_Fq)$ is small, $|u| \\ll 1$. Let's analyze the logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln\\left( \\frac{u+1+i\\epsilon}{u-1+i\\epsilon} \\right) = \\ln(u+1+i\\epsilon) - \\ln(u-1+i\\epsilon)\n$$\nFor small real $u$, $u+1 > 0$, and $u-1  0$. The infinitesimal $i\\epsilon$ specifies the branch of the complex logarithm: $\\ln(z)=\\ln|z|+i\\arg(z)$.\n$\\ln(u+1+i\\epsilon) = \\ln(1+u)$.\n$\\ln(u-1+i\\epsilon) = \\ln(|u-1|) + i\\pi = \\ln(1-u) + i\\pi$.\nSo, the logarithm becomes $\\ln(1+u) - (\\ln(1-u)+i\\pi) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1+u}{1-u}\\right) - i\\pi$.\nWe expand the logarithm for small $u$: $\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+u}{1-u}\\right) = \\ln(1+u) - \\ln(1-u) \\approx (u - \\frac{u^2}{2} + \\dots) - (-u - \\frac{u^2}{2} + \\dots) = 2u + O(u^3)$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\chi_{0}^{R}$:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}^{R}(q,\\omega) \\approx -N_0 + N_0 \\frac{u}{2} (2u - i\\pi) = -N_0 + N_0 u^2 - i \\frac{\\pi N_0}{2} u\n$$\nSubstituting $u = \\omega/(v_F q)$, we obtain the response function to leading nontrivial orders:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}^{R}(q,\\omega) \\approx -N_0+ N_0\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{v_Fq}\\right)^2 - i\\frac{\\pi N_0}{2}\\frac{\\omega}{v_Fq}\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}^{R}(q,\\omega) \\approx -N_0\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{v_Fq}\\right)^2 + i\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{\\omega}{v_Fq}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe second part of the question asks for a qualitative discussion of the effect of scattering. The result derived above is for a \"clean\" or \"collisionless\" system, where the electron mean free path is infinite ($\\tau \\to \\infty$). This is also referred to as the ballistic regime.\n\n**Ballistic vs. Diffusive Regimes:**\nThe introduction of a finite scattering time $\\tau$ and mean free path $\\ell=v_F\\tau$ allows for a distinction between two primary transport regimes, determined by the dimensionless parameters $\\omega\\tau$ and $q\\ell$.\n\n1.  **Ballistic Regime ($\\omega\\tau \\gg 1$ and $q\\ell \\gg 1$)**: In this regime, electrons travel freely over distances much larger than the perturbation wavelength ($1/q$) and for times much longer than the perturbation period ($1/\\omega$). This is the limit calculated above. The key feature is the imaginary part, $\\text{Im}[\\chi_0^R] \\approx -\\frac{\\pi N_0}{2}\\frac{\\omega}{v_F q}$, which is non-zero for $\\omega  v_Fq$. This term describes Landau damping: collisionless energy dissipation via the resonant interaction of electrons with the propagating potential wave. Electrons moving with velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ satisfying the condition $\\omega = \\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}$ can absorb energy from the wave, leading to damping. This process is non-local in nature.\n\n2.  **Diffusive (Hydrodynamic) Regime ($\\omega\\tau \\ll 1$ and $q\\ell \\ll 1$)**: In this regime, electrons undergo many collisions within one period and one wavelength of the perturbation. The particle motion is no longer ballistic but diffusive. The concept of individual particle-wave resonance breaks down. The collective density response is governed by the diffusion equation. The charge susceptibility in this limit takes on a characteristic diffusive form:\n    $$\n    \\chi(q,\\omega) \\approx -N_0 \\frac{Dq^2}{Dq^2 - i\\omega}\n    $$\n    where $D \\approx v_F^2\\tau/3$ is the diffusion constant in 3D. This form ensures charge conservation (since $\\chi(q=0,\\omega)=0$) and has a simple pole at $\\omega=-iDq^2$, which is the signature of a diffusive relaxation process. The imaginary part has a different structure:\n    $$\n    \\text{Im}[\\chi(q,\\omega)] = -N_0 \\frac{\\omega Dq^2}{(Dq^2)^2 + \\omega^2}\n    $$\n    For low frequencies $\\omega \\ll Dq^2$, this becomes $\\text{Im}[\\chi] \\approx -N_0 \\frac{\\omega}{Dq^2}$. In contrast to the ballistic regime's $\\omega/q$ dependence, the diffusive regime shows an $\\omega/q^2$ dependence, reflecting the fundamentally different local, collisional nature of the dynamics.\n\nThe crossover between these regimes occurs when $\\omega\\tau \\sim 1$ or $q\\ell \\sim 1$. The form of the response function changes qualitatively, from one dominated by the non-local, resonant behavior of free-streaming particles to one described by local, macroscopic transport coefficients like the diffusion constant.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-N_{0}\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{v_{F}q}\\right)^{2} + i\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{\\omega}{v_{F}q}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3000841"}]}
