A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a first-order degenerate perturbation theory analysis for the Hamiltonian $H = H_0 + V(x)$, where $H_0 = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m}$ is the free-electron Hamiltonian and $V(x) = 2 V_{1} \\cos(Gx)$ is the perturbation. The analysis is performed at the Brillouin zone boundary $k=k_0=\\frac{\\pi}{a}$, where the free-electron states $|k_0\\rangle$ and $|k_0-G\\rangle$ are degenerate. The unperturbed energy of both states is $E^0_{k_0} = \\frac{\\hbar^2k_0^2}{2m}$.\n\n### Task 1: Construct the effective Hamiltonian\nThe effective Hamiltonian in the degenerate subspace spanned by the basis $\\{|1\\rangle, |2\\rangle\\} \\equiv \\{|k_0\\rangle, |k_0-G\\rangle\\}$ is a $2\\times 2$ matrix with elements $H_{ij} = \\langle i|H|j\\rangle$.\nThe matrix elements are:\n$$\nH_{ij} = \\langle i|H_0 + V|j\\rangle = \\langle i|H_0|j\\rangle + \\langle i|V|j\\rangle\n$$\nSince the basis states are eigenstates of $H_0$, we have $\\langle i|H_0|j\\rangle = E^0_{k_0} \\delta_{ij}$. The matrix for $H_0$ is diagonal.\nThe task reduces to calculating the matrix elements of the perturbation $V(x)$:\n$$\nW_{ij} = \\langle i|V|j\\rangle\n$$\nThe effective Hamiltonian matrix will be $H_{eff} = E^0_{k_0}I + W$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nThe potential can be written as $V(x) = V_1 e^{iGx} + V_1 e^{-iGx}$. The matrix element of a periodic potential $V(x) = \\sum_{G'} V_{G'} e^{iG'x}$ between two plane-wave states $|k\\rangle$ and $|k'\\rangle$ is given by $\\langle k'|V|k\\rangle = V_{k-k'}$.\nBy comparing $V(x)$ with its Fourier series, we identify the non-zero Fourier components as $V_G = V_1$ and $V_{-G} = V_1$. The DC component $V_0$ is zero.\n\nLet's compute the elements of the matrix $W$:\n- **Diagonal elements:**\n$W_{11} = \\langle k_0|V|k_0\\rangle = V_{k_0-k_0} = V_0 = 0$.\n$W_{22} = \\langle k_0-G|V|k_0-G\\rangle = V_{(k_0-G)-(k_0-G)} = V_0 = 0$.\n\n- **Off-diagonal elements:**\n$W_{12} = \\langle k_0|V|k_0-G\\rangle = V_{k_0-(k_0-G)} = V_G = V_1$.\n$W_{21} = \\langle k_0-G|V|k_0\\rangle = V_{(k_0-G)-k_0} = V_{-G} = V_1$.\n\nThe perturbation matrix is:\n$$\nW = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & V_1 \\\\ V_1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe full effective Hamiltonian in the subspace is:\n$$\nH_{eff} = \\begin{pmatrix} E^0_{k_0} & V_1 \\\\ V_1 & E^0_{k_0} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix, with $E^0_{k_0} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}(\\frac{\\pi}{a})^2$ and the explicit identification of the off-diagonal elements as the Fourier component $V_G=V_1$ and diagonal perturbation elements as $V_0=0$, completes the first task. For diagonalization, we only need the perturbation matrix $W$.\n\n### Task 2: Find the energy splitting $\\Delta E$\nTo find the first-order corrections to the energy, we must find the eigenvalues of the perturbation matrix $W$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(W - \\epsilon I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n-\\epsilon & V_1 \\\\\nV_1 & -\\epsilon\n\\end{vmatrix} = (-\\epsilon)(-\\epsilon) - (V_1)(V_1) = \\epsilon^2 - V_1^2 = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\epsilon_{\\pm} = \\pm V_1$. These are the first-order energy corrections.\nThe perturbed energy levels at $k=k_0$ are $E_{\\pm} = E^0_{k_0} + \\epsilon_{\\pm} = E^0_{k_0} \\pm V_1$.\nThe higher energy is $E_{+} = E^0_{k_0} + V_1$, and the lower energy is $E_{-} = E^0_{k_0} - V_1$.\nThe energy splitting, or band gap, at the Brillouin zone boundary is:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{+} - E_{-} = (E^0_{k_0} + V_1) - (E^0_{k_0} - V_1) = 2V_1\n$$\n\n### Task 3: Determine the normalized eigenvectors\nThe eigenvectors are found by solving the equation $W \\mathbf{c} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{c}$ for each eigenvalue $\\epsilon$. An eigenvector is of the form $\\mathbf{c} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_{k_0} \\\\ c_{k_0-G} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Case 1: Higher energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_{+} = +V_1$**\nThe corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{c}^{(+)}$ satisfies:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & V_1 \\\\ V_1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c^{(+)}_{k_0} \\\\ c^{(+)}_{k_0-G} \\end{pmatrix} = V_1 \\begin{pmatrix} c^{(+)}_{k_0} \\\\ c^{(+)}_{k_0-G} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis yields the system of equations:\n$V_1 c^{(+)}_{k_0-G} = V_1 c^{(+)}_{k_0} \\implies c^{(+)}_{k_0-G} = c^{(+)}_{k_0}$.\nThe eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Normalizing it:\n$(c^{(+)}_{k_0})^2 + (c^{(+)}_{k_0-G})^2 = 1 \\implies c^2 + c^2 = 1 \\implies 2c^2 = 1 \\implies c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nThe problem specifies real coefficients, so we have:\n$c^{(+)}_{k_0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $c^{(+)}_{k_0-G} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n**Case 2: Lower energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_{-} = -V_1$**\nThe corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{c}^{(-)}$ satisfies:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & V_1 \\\\ V_1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c^{(-)}_{k_0} \\\\ c^{(-)}_{k_0-G} \\end{pmatrix} = -V_1 \\begin{pmatrix} c^{(-)}_{k_0} \\\\ c^{(-)}_{k_0-G} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis yields the system of equations:\n$V_1 c^{(-)}_{k_0-G} = -V_1 c^{(-)}_{k_0} \\implies c^{(-)}_{k_0-G} = -c^{(-)}_{k_0}$.\nThe eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.

We will proceed with a full derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive the effective mass tensor for a Bloch electron, specialize it to the provided tight-binding dispersion on a 2D rectangular lattice, and compute its principal components at the band minimum.\n\nWe begin with the semiclassical equations of motion for a Bloch electron with crystal momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ in a single band with energy dispersion $E(\\mathbf{k})$. The electron is subject to a weak, slowly varying external force $\\mathbf{F}$. The equations are:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{r}} = \\mathbf{v}_g(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} E(\\mathbf{k})\n$$\n$$\n\\hbar \\dot{\\mathbf{k}} = \\mathbf{F}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{v}_g$ is the group velocity of the electron wavepacket and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe acceleration of the electron is the time derivative of its group velocity, $\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_g}{dt}$. Using the chain rule, we can express the components of the acceleration vector, $a_i$, as:\n$$\na_i = \\frac{d v_{gi}}{dt} = \\sum_{j} \\frac{\\partial v_{gi}}{\\partial k_j} \\frac{d k_j}{dt}\n$$\nwhere $i$ and $j$ index the spatial dimensions (in this case, $x$ and $y$). From the second semiclassical equation, we have $\\frac{dk_j}{dt} = \\frac{F_j}{\\hbar}$. Substituting this into the expression for acceleration yields:\n$$\na_i = \\sum_{j} \\frac{\\partial v_{gi}}{\\partial k_j} \\frac{F_j}{\\hbar}\n$$\nNow we substitute the definition of the group velocity, $v_{gi} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k_i}$:\n$$\na_i = \\sum_{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_j} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k_i} \\right) \\frac{F_j}{\\hbar} = \\sum_{j} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial k_i \\partial k_j} \\right) F_j\n$$\nThis equation relates the acceleration of the electron to the applied force. It is analogous to Newton's second law, $F_i = \\sum_j m_{ij} a_j$. To make the analogy direct, we can write the relation in inverse form, $a_i = \\sum_j (m^{-1})_{ij} F_j$. By comparing our derived expression for $a_i$ with this form, we can identify the components of the inverse effective mass tensor, $(m^{*-1})_{ij}$:\n$$\n(m^{*-1})_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 E(\\mathbf{k})}{\\partial k_i \\partial k_j}\n$$\nThe effective mass tensor, $m^*$, is then the matrix inverse of $m^{*-1}$. This tensor quantifies the inertial properties of the electron within the crystal, which are determined by the curvature of the energy band $E(\\mathbf{k})$.\n\nNext, we apply this general result to the specific energy dispersion given for the 2D rectangular lattice:\n$$\nE(\\mathbf{k}) = E(k_x, k_y) = \\varepsilon - 2 t_x \\cos(k_x a_x) - 2 t_y \\cos(k_y a_y)\n$$\nWe need to compute the second partial derivatives of $E(\\mathbf{k})$ with respect to the components of $\\mathbf{k}$.\nFirst, the first partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k_x} = 2 t_x a_x \\sin(k_x a_x)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k_y} = 2 t_y a_y \\sin(k_y a_y)\n$$\nThen, the second partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial k_x^2} = 2 t_x a_x^2 \\cos(k_x a_x)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial k_y^2} = 2 t_y a_y^2 \\cos(k_y a_y)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial k_x \\partial k_y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial k_y \\partial k_x} = 0\n$$\nSince the mixed partial derivatives are zero, the inverse effective mass tensor is diagonal.

For a rectangular lattice, the primitive lattice vectors $a_x$ and $a_y$ are generally different, $a_x \\neq a_y$. Correspondingly, the hopping amplitudes $t_x$ and $t_y$, which depend on the orbital overlap between neighboring atoms, will also generally be different, $t_x \\neq t_y$. As shown by our final expressions, $m_x^*$ depends on $a_x$ and $t_x$, while $m_y^*$ depends on $a_y$ and $t_y$. Thus, for a general rectangular lattice, $m_x^* \\neq m_y^*$. This inequality signifies that the electron's inertia is direction-dependent. An applied force along the $x$-direction will induce an acceleration corresponding to the mass $m_x^*$, while a force along the $y$-direction will induce an acceleration corresponding to the different mass $m_y^*$. This is the physical meaning of an anisotropic effective mass, which is a direct consequence of the underlying structural and electronic anisotropy of the crystal. If the lattice were square ($a_x = a_y = a$) and the hopping were isotropic ($t_x = t_y = t$), the effective mass would be isotropic at the band minimum, with $m_x^* = m_y^* = \\hbar^2/(2ta^2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 t_x a_x^2} & \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 t_y a_y^2} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2972729"}, {"introduction": "Bridging analytical theory with computational practice is a vital skill for the modern physicist.

For each test case, the parameters are given in the order $(a, V_0, k, N_{\\max}, N_x)$, where $a$ is the lattice constant, $V_0$ is the potential amplitude (in the reduced energy units), $k$ is the crystal momentum (in inverse length units consistent with $a$), $N_{\\max}$ is the plane-wave truncation index, and $N_x$ is the number of uniformly spaced grid points to sample $x \\in [0,a)$:\n\n- Test Case 1 (happy path, free electron baseline): $(a, V_0, k, N_{\\max}, N_x) = (1.0, 0.0, 0.3\\pi, 4, 512)$.\n- Test Case 2 (moderate potential, zone center): $(1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 5, 512)$.\n- Test Case 3 (band-edge boundary condition): $(1.0, 1.0, \\pi, 7, 512)$.\n- Test Case 4 (different lattice constant): $(2.0, 0.8, 0.25\\pi / 2.0, 5, 512)$.\n\nFor each test case, your program must output a list of three floating-point numbers:\n- The lowest energy $E$ at the specified $k$, reported as the dimensionless number $E a^2$.\n- The maximum periodicity deviation $\\Delta_u$ as defined above.\n- The maximum Bloch quasi-periodicity deviation $\\Delta_\\psi$ as defined above.\n\nFinal output format requirement: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is itself a list of three floats for one test case. For example, a valid output format is\n$$\n[[\\,E_1,\\Delta_{u,1},\\Delta_{\\psi,1}\\,],[\\,E_2,\\Delta_{u,2},\\Delta_{\\psi,2}\\,],\\ldots\\,].\n$$\nAngles must be in radians. Energies must be reported in the dimensionless unit $(\\hbar^2/(m a^2))$ as specified above. No other text should be printed.", "solution": "The problem requires the numerical implementation of Bloch's theorem for a one-dimensional crystal with a periodic potential $V(x) = V_0 \\cos(2\\pi x/a)$. The solution involves constructing and diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in a plane-wave basis to find the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.\n\nThe fundamental equation is the time-independent Schrödinger equation for an electron of mass $m$ in a potential $V(x)$:\n$$\n\\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x)\\right]\\psi(x) = E\\,\\psi(x)\n$$\nGiven that the potential is periodic with lattice constant $a$, i.e., $V(x+a) = V(x)$, Bloch's theorem asserts that the solutions $\\psi_k(x)$ can be expressed as a product of a plane wave $e^{ikx}$ and a periodic function $u_k(x)$, where $u_k(x+a) = u_k(x)$. The label $k$ is the crystal momentum, a quantum number characterizing the state. The Bloch form is $\\psi_k(x) = e^{ikx} u_k(x)$.\n\nThe periodic part, $u_k(x)$, can be expanded in a Fourier series over the reciprocal lattice vectors $G_n = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} n$ for integer $n$:\n$$\nu_k(x) = \\sum_{n} C_n(k) e^{i G_n x}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Bloch form for $\\psi_k(x)$ yields a plane-wave expansion for the full wavefunction:\n$$\n\\psi_k(x) = e^{ikx} \\sum_{n} C_n(k) e^{i G_n x} = \\sum_{n} C_n(k) e^{i(k+G_n)x}\n$$\nThis expansion serves as the basis for our numerical approach. We truncate this infinite series to a finite basis set of plane waves, $\\{e^{i(k+G_n)x}\\}$, for integers $n$ in a symmetric range $[-N_{\\max}, N_{\\max}]$. The dimension of this basis is $D = 2N_{\\max}+1$.\n\nSubstituting the plane-wave expansion into the Schrödinger equation transforms it into a matrix eigenvalue problem for the coefficients $C_n(k)$ and energy $E_k$. The matrix elements of the Hamiltonian, $H_{mn} = \\langle k+G_m | H | k+G_n \\rangle$, are calculated in this basis. We adopt reduced units where $\\hbar=1$ and $m=1$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian consists of a kinetic part, $T = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$, and a potential part, $V(x)$.\n\nThe kinetic energy operator is diagonal in the plane-wave basis. Its matrix elements are:\n$$\nT_{mn} = \\langle k+G_m|T|k+G_n\\rangle = \\frac{(k+G_n)^2}{2} \\delta_{mn}\n$$\nThe potential energy matrix elements are given by the Fourier coefficients of the potential:\n$$\nV_{mn} = \\langle k+G_m | V(x) | k+G_n \\rangle = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_0^a e^{-i(k+G_m)x} V(x) e^{i(k+G_n)x} dx = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_0^a V(x) e^{i(G_n - G_m)x} dx = V_{G_m - G_n}\n$$\nFor the specified potential, $V(x) = V_0 \\cos(2\\pi x/a) = \\frac{V_0}{2}(e^{i(2\\pi/a)x} + e^{-i(2\\pi/a)x})$. The fundamental reciprocal lattice vector is $G_1 = 2\\pi/a$. Thus, $V(x) = \\frac{V_0}{2}(e^{iG_1 x} + e^{-iG_1 x})$. The only non-zero Fourier coefficients are $V_{G_1} = V_0/2$ and $V_{-G_1} = V_0/2$.\nThe condition $G_m - G_n = \\pm G_1$ implies $(m-n)\\frac{2\\pi}{a} = \\pm \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$, which simplifies to $m-n = \\pm 1$.\nTherefore, the potential matrix has non-zero elements only on the first super-diagonal ($m=n+1$) and sub-diagonal ($m=n-1$), with value $V_0/2$.\n\nThe full Hamiltonian matrix $H$ is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix with elements:\n$$\nH_{mn} = \\frac{(k+G_n)^2}{2} \\delta_{mn} + \\frac{V_0}{2}(\\delta_{m,n+1} + \\delta_{m,n-1})\n$$\nWe construct this $D \\times D$ matrix and diagonalize it numerically to find its eigenvalues (the energy bands $E_n(k)$) and eigenvectors (the coefficients $C_n(k)$). For this problem, we select the lowest eigenvalue $E$ and its corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{C}$.\n\nWith the coefficients $C_n$ from the eigenvector, we reconstruct the wavefunction $\\psi_k(x)$ and its periodic part $u_k(x)$ on a discrete spatial grid $x_j \\in [0, a)$:\n$$\n\\psi_k(x_j) = \\sum_{n=-N_{\\max}}^{N_{\\max}} C_n e^{i(k+G_n)x_j}\n$$\n$$\nu_k(x_j) = e^{-ikx_j}\\psi_k(x_j) = \\sum_{n=-N_{\\max}}^{N_{\\max}} C_n e^{iG_n x_j}\n$$\nBased on these numerically computed functions, we verify two fundamental properties of Bloch states by calculating the maximum deviation over the grid:\n1. Periodicity of $u_k(x)$: $\\Delta_u = \\max_{x_j} |u_k(x_j+a) - u_k(x_j)|$. Theoretically, $u_k(x_j+a) = \\sum C_n e^{iG_n(x_j+a)} = \\sum C_n e^{iG_n x_j} e^{iG_n a}$. Since $e^{iG_n a} = e^{in2\\pi} = 1$, we expect $u_k(x+a)=u_k(x)$, so $\\Delta_u$ should be zero up to numerical precision.\n2. Quasi-periodicity of $\\psi_k(x)$: $\\Delta_\\psi = \\max_{x_j} |\\psi_k(x_j+a) - e^{ika}\\psi_k(x_j)|$. Since $\\psi_k(x) = e^{ikx}u_k(x)$ and $u_k(x)$ is periodic, $\\psi_k(x+a) = e^{ik(x+a)}u_k(x+a) = e^{ika}e^{ikx}u_k(x) = e^{ika}\\psi_k(x)$. Thus, $\\Delta_\\psi$ should also be zero up to numerical precision.\n\nThese deviation metrics serve as a robust internal consistency check of the numerical implementation.
