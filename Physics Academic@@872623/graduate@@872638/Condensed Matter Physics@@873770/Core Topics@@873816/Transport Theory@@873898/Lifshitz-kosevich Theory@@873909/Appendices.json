It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from condensed matter physics that is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It asks for the derivation of Landau levels for a two-dimensional electron gas and the analysis of the corresponding quantized area in k-space, which are standard and fundamental concepts.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the single-particle energy eigenvalues for a spinless electron in a two-dimensional gas subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field.

This involves replacing the canonical momentum operator $\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}$ with the mechanical momentum operator $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Pi}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{p}} - q\\mathbf{A} = \\hat{\\mathbf{p}} + e\\mathbf{A}$, where $\\mathbf{A}$ is the magnetic vector potential satisfying $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{B}$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Pi}}^2}{2m} = \\frac{(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} + e\\mathbf{A})^2}{2m}\n$$\nThe magnetic field is uniform and perpendicular to the plane of the electron gas, $\\mathbf{B} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. We are free to choose a convenient gauge for $\\mathbf{A}$. The Landau gauge, $\\mathbf{A} = (0, Bx, 0)$, is a suitable choice. Let us verify it:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial z}\\right)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial x}\\right)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial y}\\right)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial(Bx)}{\\partial x} - 0\\right)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nThe gauge choice is correct. The motion is confined to the $xy$-plane, so we consider $\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} = (\\hat{p}_x, \\hat{p}_y)$. The Hamiltonian becomes:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\frac{1}{2m} \\left[ (\\hat{p}_x + eA_x)^2 + (\\hat{p}_y + eA_y)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2m} \\left[ \\hat{p}_x^2 + (\\hat{p}_y + eBx)^2 \\right]\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian is independent of the coordinate $y$. Consequently, the momentum operator in the $y$-direction, $\\hat{p}_y = -i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$, commutes with the Hamiltonian: $[\\hat{H}, \\hat{p}_y] = 0$. This means we can find simultaneous eigenfunctions of $\\hat{H}$ and $\\hat{p}_y$.\nThe eigenfunctions can be written in the form of a plane wave in the $y$-direction and a function of $x$:\n$$\n\\psi(x,y) = e^{i k_y y} \\phi(x)\n$$\nThe eigenvalue of $\\hat{p}_y$ for this state is $\\hbar k_y$. Substituting this form of the wavefunction into the time-independent Schrödinger equation $\\hat{H}\\psi = E\\psi$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2m} \\left[ \\hat{p}_x^2 + (\\hbar k_y + eBx)^2 \\right] e^{i k_y y} \\phi(x) = E e^{i k_y y} \\phi(x)\n$$\nCanceling the term $e^{i k_y y}$ from both sides, we obtain a one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for $\\phi(x)$:\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{\\hat{p}_x^2}{2m} + \\frac{(eB)^2}{2m} \\left(x + \\frac{\\hbar k_y}{eB}\\right)^2 \\right] \\phi(x) = E \\phi(x)\n$$\nThis equation is mathematically identical to the Schrödinger equation for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) with Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{QHO} = \\frac{\\hat{P}^2}{2M} + \\frac{1}{2}M\\Omega^2 (X - X_0)^2$. By comparing the two forms, we can identify the parameters:\nThe mass of the oscillator is the electron's band mass, $M=m$. The potential term is $\\frac{1}{2} m \\Omega^2 (x-x_0)^2$.\nComparing coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m \\Omega^2 = \\frac{(eB)^2}{2m} \\implies \\Omega^2 = \\frac{(eB)^2}{m^2} \\implies \\Omega = \\frac{eB}{m}\n$$\nThis frequency is the classical cyclotron frequency, denoted $\\omega_c = \\frac{eB}{m}$. The equilibrium position of the oscillator is shifted to $x_0 = -\\frac{\\hbar k_y}{eB}$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues of the quantum harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\Omega$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, ...$). Therefore, the energy eigenvalues of the electron in the magnetic field are:\n$$\nE_n = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega_c = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\frac{\\hbar e B}{m}\n$$\nThese quantized energy levels are known as Landau levels. The energy is independent of the wavevector $k_y$, which implies a high degree of degeneracy for each level. The continuous energy spectrum of the free electron gas has collapsed into a discrete set of massively degenerate levels. This discreteness arises from the quantization of the closed cyclotron orbits that the electrons would classically follow.\n\n**Part 2: Quantization of k-space Area and the Lifshitz-Kosevich Theory**\n\nThe problem defines a wavevector $k_n$ such that the free-electron energy at this wavevector equals the $n$-th Landau level energy: $\\epsilon(k_n) = E_n$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar^2 k_n^2}{2m} = E_n = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\frac{\\hbar e B}{m}\n$$\nWe can solve for $k_n^2$:\n$$\n\\hbar^2 k_n^2 = 2m \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\frac{\\hbar e B}{m} = (2n+1)\\hbar e B\n$$\n$$\nk_n^2 = (2n+1)\\frac{eB}{\\hbar}\n$$\nThe constant-energy contour at energy $E_n$ is a circle in $\\mathbf{k}$-space with radius $k_n$. The area $A_n$ enclosed by this contour is:\n$$\nA_n = \\pi k_n^2 = \\pi (2n+1)\\frac{eB}{\\hbar} = \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar} \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis result explicitly shows that the area in $\\mathbf{k}$-space enclosed by the semiclassical orbits corresponding to the allowed energy levels is quantized. The allowed areas are discrete and linearly dependent on the integer $n$. The difference in area between adjacent levels is a constant:\n$$\n\\Delta A = A_{n+1} - A_n = \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar} \\left( (n+1) + \\frac{1}{2} - \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental quantization rule for electron orbits in a magnetic field.\n\nThe Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) theory, which describes quantum oscillations in metals, is built upon the semiclassical Lifshitz-Onsager quantization rule for an electron orbit on a constant energy surface:\n$$\nA_k = \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar} (n + \\gamma)\n$$\nHere, $A_k$ is the extremal cross-sectional area of the Fermi surface perpendicular to the magnetic field, $n$ is an integer index, and $\\gamma$ is a phase offset.\n\nComparing our derived expression for $A_n$ with the general Lifshitz-Onsager formula, we find a perfect match with a phase offset $\\gamma = 1/2$.\n\nThe role of the phase offset $\\gamma$ is profound. In the semiclassical WKB approximation, this term arises from the phase shifts at the turning points of the classical trajectory. For a simple harmonic oscillator potential, the WKB quantization condition $\\oint p \\, dx = 2\\pi\\hbar(n+\\frac{1}{2})$ includes this half-integer term. Since the problem of an electron in a magnetic field can be mapped to a harmonic oscillator, the appearance of $\\gamma = 1/2$ is a direct consequence. More generally, in modern terms, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\phi_B}{2\\pi}$, where $\\phi_B$ is the Berry phase accumulated by an electron moving along the closed k-space orbit. For a simple parabolic band as considered here, the Berry phase is zero ($\\phi_B=0$), so $\\gamma$ reduces to the Maslov index contribution of $1/2$. For other band structures, such as the Dirac cones in graphene, $\\phi_B = \\pi$, which leads to $\\gamma = 0$ and a qualitatively different Landau level spectrum, including a level at zero energy. Thus, the phase offset $\\gamma$ in the LK formula is a key signature of the topological properties of the electronic band structure.\n\nThe problem asks for a final closed-form expression for $E_n$.

All concepts, such as semiclassical quantization, cyclotron mass, and the tight-binding model, are well-established. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear path of derivations and a specific model for application.

The problem is self-contained and free from scientific or logical contradictions. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is structured in three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the cyclotron effective mass $m^*$ in terms of the energy derivative of the orbital area in $k$-space, $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial E}$. The semiclassical quantization of cyclotron orbits is given by the Onsager relation, which states that the area $A_n$ in $k$-space enclosed by the orbit of the $n$-th Landau level is quantized:\n$$\nA_n = (n + \\gamma) \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar}\n$$\nwhere $n$ is an integer, $\\gamma$ is a phase factor (typically $1/2$), $e$ is the elementary charge, $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe energy of the $n$-th Landau level is $E_n$. We can write the area $A(E)$ enclosed by a constant-energy contour $E$ as $A(E_n) = A_n$. For adjacent Landau levels, the difference in area is constant:\n$$\n\\Delta A = A_{n+1} - A_n = \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar}\n$$\nThe energy separation between consecutive Landau levels, for large $n$, defines the cyclotron energy $\\hbar \\omega_c$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{n+1} - E_n \\approx \\hbar \\omega_c\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_c = \\frac{eB}{m^*}$ is the cyclotron frequency and $m^*$ is the cyclotron effective mass.\n\nIn the semiclassical limit (large $n$), we can treat the energy $E$ as a continuous variable. The derivative $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial E}$ can be approximated by the ratio of finite differences:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial E} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{2\\pi e B / \\hbar}{\\hbar \\omega_c} = \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar^2 \\omega_c}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\omega_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial E} = \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar^2 (eB/m^*)} = \\frac{2\\pi m^*}{\\hbar^2}\n$$\nSolving for the cyclotron effective mass $m^*$ yields the desired relation:\n$$\nm^* = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial E}\n$$\n\nSecond, we derive the geometric expression for $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial E}$. The area $A(E)$ is the integral over the region in $k$-space enclosed by the constant-energy contour $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ defined by $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}) = E$:\n$$\nA(E) = \\iint_{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}')\\le E} d^2k'\n$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial E}$ is the rate of change of this area with energy. Consider the change in area $dA$ corresponding to an infinitesimal change in energy $dE$. This $dA$ is the area of the thin shell between the contours $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ and $\\mathcal{C}(E+dE)$. Let $dl$ be an element of arc length along $\\mathcal{C}(E)$. The perpendicular distance $dk_\\perp$ in $k$-space from $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ to $\\mathcal{C}(E+dE)$ is related to $dE$ by the gradient of the energy dispersion $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})$, which is normal to the constant-energy contour.\n$$\ndE = |\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\epsilon| dk_\\perp \\implies dk_\\perp = \\frac{dE}{|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\epsilon|}\n$$\nThe elemental area of the shell is $dA = \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}(E)} dk_\\perp dl$.

This allows us to expand the dispersion for small $k_x a$ and $k_y a$. Using the Taylor expansion $\\cos(x) \\approx 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2}$ for small $x$, we get:\n$$\n\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}) \\approx -2t\\left[\\left(1 - \\frac{(k_x a)^2}{2}\\right) + \\left(1 - \\frac{(k_y a)^2}{2}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}) \\approx -2t\\left[2 - \\frac{a^2}{2}(k_x^2 + k_y^2)\\right] = -4t + ta^2(k_x^2 + k_y^2)\n$$\nLet $k^2 = k_x^2 + k_y^2$.
