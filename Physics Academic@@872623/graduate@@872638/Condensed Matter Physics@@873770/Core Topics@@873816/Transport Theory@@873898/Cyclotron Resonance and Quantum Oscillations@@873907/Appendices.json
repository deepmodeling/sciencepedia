Derivation of the general formula for the semiclassical cyclotron frequency.\n\nThe semiclassical motion of a Bloch electron in a uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is governed by the equation of motion for its crystal momentum $\\mathbf{k}$:\n$$ \\hbar \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}}{dt} = -e \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} $$\nwhere $-e$ is the charge of the electron and $\\mathbf{v}$ is its group velocity, given by $\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\varepsilon(\\mathbf{k})$. The electron's energy $\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{k})$ is conserved, so its trajectory in $\\mathbf{k}$-space is confined to a constant-energy surface. The Lorentz force causes the electron to precess on this surface. The trajectory, or orbit, in $\\mathbf{k}$-space is the intersection of the constant-energy surface $\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{k}) = \\varepsilon$ and a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, e.g., $k_z = \\text{constant}$ for $\\mathbf{B} = B \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n\nThe cyclotron period $T_c$ is the time required to complete one such orbit. It can be written as an integral over the path length $dl_k$ of the orbit in $\\mathbf{k}$-space:\n$$ T_c = \\oint dt = \\oint \\frac{dl_k}{|d\\mathbf{k}/dt|} $$\nFrom the equation of motion, $|d\\mathbf{k}/dt| = \\frac{e}{\\hbar} |\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}| = \\frac{eBv_{\\perp}}{\\hbar}$, where $v_{\\perp}$ is the component of the velocity perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$.\n\nThus, $T_c = \\frac{\\hbar}{eB} \\oint \\frac{dl_k}{v_{\\perp}}$. Since $\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\varepsilon(\\mathbf{k})$, the component $v_{\\perp}$ is given by $v_{\\perp} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} |\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}} \\varepsilon|$, where $\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}$ is the component of $\\mathbf{k}$ in the plane of the orbit.\n$$ T_c = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{eB} \\oint \\frac{dl_k}{|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}} \\varepsilon|} $$\nThis expression can be related to the cross-sectional area of the Fermi surface. Let $A(\\varepsilon)$ be the area in $\\mathbf{k}$-space enclosed by the orbit at energy $\\varepsilon$. Consider two nearby orbits at energies $\\varepsilon$ and $\\varepsilon+d\\varepsilon$. The incremental area $dA$ between them is given by $dA = \\oint dl_k \\, dk_{\\perp}$, where $dk_{\\perp}$ is the perpendicular distance in $\\mathbf{k}$-space between the two orbits. This distance is related to the energy separation $d\\varepsilon$ by $d\\varepsilon = |\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}} \\varepsilon| \\, dk_{\\perp}$.\nTherefore, $dk_{\\perp} = \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}} \\varepsilon|}$.

Therefore, its general formula is:\n$$ \\omega_c(\\varepsilon, B) = \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar^2} \\left( \\frac{dA(\\varepsilon)}{d\\varepsilon} \\right)^{-1} $$\nThis is the Onsager-Lifshitz relation for the cyclotron frequency.\n\n2.

A constant-energy surface is a sphere in $\\mathbf{k}$-space with radius $k = \\varepsilon / (\\hbar v_F)$.\nThe magnetic field is $\\mathbf{B} = B \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The cyclotron orbits are intersections of the constant-energy sphere with planes of constant $k_z$. The extremal cross-sectional area $A(\\varepsilon)$ occurs for the orbit at $k_z=0$. This orbit is a circle in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane.\nFor $k_z=0$, the radius of the circle $k_{\\perp}$ is simply the radius of the sphere, $k_{\\perp} = k = \\varepsilon/(\\hbar v_F)$.\nThe extremal area $A(\\varepsilon)$ is thus the area of this circle:\n$$ A(\\varepsilon) = \\pi k_{\\perp}^2 = \\pi \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\hbar v_F} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi \\varepsilon^2}{\\hbar^2 v_F^2} $$\nNext, we compute the derivative of this area with respect to energy:\n$$ \\frac{dA(\\varepsilon)}{d\\varepsilon} = \\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\varepsilon^2}{\\hbar^2 v_F^2} \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi \\varepsilon}{\\hbar^2 v_F^2} $$\nNow we substitute this derivative into the general formula for $\\omega_c$, evaluating it at the Fermi energy, $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_F$:\n$$ \\omega_c(\\varepsilon_F, B) = \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar^2} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\varepsilon_F}{\\hbar^2 v_F^2} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{\\hbar^2 v_F^2}{2\\pi \\varepsilon_F} = \\frac{e B v_F^2}{\\varepsilon_F} $$\n\n3. Quantum oscillations and the Onsager frequency $F(\\varepsilon_F)$.\n\nIn the semiclassical approximation, the allowed electron orbits are quantized according to the Lifshitz-Onsager rule. The extremal cross-sectional area $A(\\varepsilon)$ of the Fermi surface is quantized as:\n$$ A(\\varepsilon_n) = \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar} (n + \\gamma) $$\nwhere $n$ is an integer (the Landau level index) and $\\gamma$ is a phase offset. Quantum oscillations in physical properties (such as resistivity or magnetization) occur as the magnetic field $B$ is varied, causing successive Landau levels to pass through the Fermi energy $\\varepsilon_F$. A property will show an extremum whenever a Landau level $\\varepsilon_n$ coincides with $\\varepsilon_F$. This occurs for magnetic field values $B_n$ that satisfy:\n$$ A(\\varepsilon_F) = \\frac{2\\pi e B_n}{\\hbar} (n + \\gamma) $$\nRearranging for the inverse magnetic field $1/B_n$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{B_n} = \\frac{2\\pi e}{\\hbar A(\\varepsilon_F)} (n + \\gamma) $$\nThis equation shows that the oscillations are periodic in $1/B$. The period of these oscillations, $\\Delta(1/B)$, is the change in $1/B$ when $n$ changes by $1$:\n$$ \\Delta\\left(\\frac{1}{B}\\right) = \\frac{1}{B_{n}} - \\frac{1}{B_{n-1}} = \\frac{2\\pi e}{\\hbar A(\\varepsilon_F)} ((n+\\gamma) - (n-1+\\gamma)) = \\frac{2\\pi e}{\\hbar A(\\varepsilon_F)} $$\nThe Onsager frequency $F$ is defined as the inverse of this period:\n$$ F(\\varepsilon_F) = \\left[ \\Delta\\left(\\frac{1}{B}\\right) \\right]^{-1} = \\frac{\\hbar A(\\varepsilon_F)}{2\\pi e} $$\nThis expression demonstrates that the Onsager frequency, and thus the periodicity of quantum oscillations, is directly proportional to the extremal cross-sectional area of the Fermi surface $A(\\varepsilon_F)$. The phase factor $\\gamma$, which contains the Berry phase contribution, affects the absolute position (phase) of the oscillation peaks in a plot versus $1/B$, but it does not affect their spacing. Therefore, a nontrivial Berry phase does not modify the Onsager frequency $F(\\varepsilon_F)$.\n\nUsing the area for the Weyl semimetal, $A(\\varepsilon_F) = \\frac{\\pi \\varepsilon_F^2}{\\hbar^2 v_F^2}$, we find the Onsager frequency:\n$$ F(\\varepsilon_F) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\pi e} \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\varepsilon_F^2}{\\hbar^2 v_F^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_F^2}{2e\\hbar v_F^2} $$\n\n4. Shift in the quantum-oscillation phase offset $\\Delta \\gamma$.\n\nThe phase offset $\\gamma$ in the quantization condition $A = \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar}(n+\\gamma)$ is composed of several contributions. The problem specifies including a Maslov correction and a Berry phase. The total phase offset can be written as:\n$$ \\gamma = \\gamma_{\\text{Maslov}} - \\frac{\\Phi_B}{2\\pi} $$\nFor a standard three-dimensional extremal orbit (e.g., in a parabolic band), the Maslov correction corresponds to a phase factor $\\gamma_{\\text{Maslov}}=1/2$.

Then $\\mathbf{k}' = k_F(\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\cos\\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$. Due to azimuthal symmetry, the $x$ and $y$ components of the integral vanish.

This simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} dx (\\dots)$, where $x=\\cos\\theta$. We need to compute:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} dx \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{\\infty} f_{\\ell}^s P_{\\ell}(x) x\n$$\nSince $x = P_1(x)$, the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials, $\\int_{-1}^1 P_{\\ell}(x) P_m(x) dx = \\frac{2}{2\\ell+1}\\delta_{\\ell m}$, selects only the $\\ell=1$ term:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{\\infty} f_{\\ell}^s \\int_{-1}^{1} P_{\\ell}(x) P_1(x) dx = \\frac{1}{2} f_1^s \\left(\\frac{2}{2(1)+1}\\right) = \\frac{f_1^s}{3}\n$$\nThis is the origin of the angular factor. Substituting this result back into the equation (and dropping the vector notation as all terms are parallel):\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar k_F}{m^*} + \\frac{2 N(0) \\hbar k_F}{m^*} \\left(\\frac{f_1^s}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar k_F}{m_b}\n$$\nDividing by $\\hbar k_F$ and rearranging:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{m^*} \\left(1 + \\frac{2 N(0) f_1^s}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{m_b}\n$$\nThe problem states that the dimensionless Landau parameter is defined as $F_{1}^{s} = N(0) f_{1}^{s}$, where $N(0)$ is the density of states per spin. Substituting this definition into our derived equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{m^*} \\left(1 + \\frac{2 F_1^s}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{m_b}\n$$\nSolving for the ratio of the effective mass $m^*$ to the bare mass $m_b$, we obtain the required relation based on the given premises:\n$$\n\\frac{m^*}{m_b} = 1 + \\frac{2F_1^s}{3}\n$$\nThis relation connects the thermodynamic effective mass to the $\\ell=1$ Landau parameter.\n\n**(b) dHvA Oscillation Amplitude Ratio**\n\nThe oscillatory component of magnetization in the dHvA effect is described by the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula. For the fundamental harmonic ($p=1$), the amplitude $A$ is attenuated by several factors, including a thermal damping factor, $R_T$. The problem specifies that we can neglect impurity scattering (Dingle factor $R_D=1$) and spin splitting (spin factor $R_S=1$). The amplitude of the fundamental oscillation is therefore proportional to $R_T$:\n$$\nA \\propto R_T = \\frac{X}{\\sinh(X)}\n$$\nwhere the argument $X$ is given by:\n$$\nX = \\frac{2\\pi^2 k_B T}{\\hbar \\omega_c}\n$$\nHere, $T$ is the temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $\\omega_c$ is the cyclotron frequency. The cyclotron frequency depends on the magnetic field $B$ and the cyclotron effective mass $m_c$:\n$$\n\\omega_c = \\frac{eB}{m_c}\n$$\nSo, the argument $X$ can be written as:\n$$\nX = \\frac{2\\pi^2 k_B T m_c}{eB\\hbar}\n$$\nThe problem states that for an isotropic parabolic band, the cyclotron mass $m_c$ is equal to the thermodynamic effective mass $m^*$. Thus, $m_c = m^*$.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the oscillation amplitude in the interacting case, $A(F_1^s)$, to that in the non-interacting case, $A(0)$.\n\nIn the interacting case, the effective mass is $m^*$, so the argument is $X_{int}$:\n$$\nX_{int} = \\frac{2\\pi^2 k_B T m^*}{eB\\hbar}\n$$\nThe amplitude is $A(F_1^s) \\propto \\frac{X_{int}}{\\sinh(X_{int})}$.\n\nIn the non-interacting case, the interactions are turned off, which corresponds to setting all Landau parameters to zero, including $F_1^s=0$. From the result of part (a), if $F_1^s=0$, then $m^*/m_b = 1+0=1$, so $m^*=m_b$. The relevant mass is the bare band mass $m_b$. The argument of the damping factor is $X_{non-int}$:\n$$\nX_{non-int} = \\frac{2\\pi^2 k_B T m_b}{eB\\hbar}\n$$\nThe amplitude is $A(0) \\propto \\frac{X_{non-int}}{\\sinh(X_{non-int})}$.\n\nThe ratio of the amplitudes is:\n$$\n\\frac{A(F_1^s)}{A(0)} = \\frac{X_{int}/\\sinh(X_{int})}{X_{non-int}/\\sinh(X_{non-int})} = \\frac{X_{int}}{X_{non-int}} \\frac{\\sinh(X_{non-int})}{\\sinh(X_{int})}\n$$\nThe ratio of the arguments is simply the ratio of the masses:\n$$\n\\frac{X_{int}}{X_{non-int}} = \\frac{m^*}{m_b}\n$$\nUsing the result derived in part (a), $\\frac{m^*}{m_b} = 1 + \\frac{2F_1^s}{3}$.\nSubstituting this into the amplitude ratio formula, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{A(F_1^s)}{A(0)} = \\left(1 + \\frac{2F_1^s}{3}\\right) \\frac{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{2\\pi^2 k_B T m_b}{eB\\hbar}\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{2\\pi^2 k_B T m^*}{eB\\hbar}\\right)}\n$$\nFinally, we express $m^*$ in the denominator's sinh argument in terms of $m_b$ and $F_1^s$:\n$$\nm^* = m_b\\left(1 + \\frac{2F_1^s}{3}\\right)\n$$\nThis leads to the final expression for the amplitude ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{A(F_1^s)}{A(0)} = \\left(1 + \\frac{2F_1^s}{3}\\right) \\frac{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{2\\pi^2 k_B T m_b}{eB\\hbar}\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\left(1 + \\frac{2F_1^s}{3}\\right) \\frac{2\\pi^2 k_B T m_b}{eB\\hbar}\\right)}\n$$\nThis expression gives the ratio purely in terms of the required variables $F_1^s$, $T$, $B$, $m_b$, $e$, $\\hbar$, and $k_B$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(1 + \\frac{2F_{1}^{s}}{3}\\right) \\frac{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{2\\pi^2 k_{B} T m_{b}}{eB\\hbar}\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\left(1 + \\frac{2F_{1}^{s}}{3}\\right) \\frac{2\\pi^2 k_{B} T m_{b}}{eB\\hbar}\\right)}}$$", "id": "2980375"}]}
