It represents a standard exercise in semiconductor physics. We will now proceed with the derivation from first principles as requested.\n\nThe concentration of electrons, $n$, in the conduction band and the concentration of holes, $p$, in the valence band are given in the nondegenerate (Maxwell-Boltzmann) limit by the following fundamental expressions:\n$$n = N_C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$p = N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $N_C$ and $N_V$ are the effective densities of states in the conduction and valence bands, respectively, $E_C$ and $E_V$ are the energies of the band edges, $E_F$ is the Fermi level, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nFirst, we derive the equilibrium relation between $n$ and $p$. This is achieved by computing the product $np$:\n$$np = \\left(N_C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) \\left(N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$np = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F + E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe Fermi level $E_F$ cancels in the exponent, leading to:\n$$np = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe energy difference $E_g = E_C - E_V$ is the semiconductor bandgap energy. Therefore, the product becomes:\n$$np = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nAt a fixed temperature $T$, the right side of this equation is a constant, as $N_C$, $N_V$, and $E_g$ are material parameters that depend on temperature but not on doping or the Fermi level. This constant is defined as the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i^2$. The intrinsic concentration $n_i$ is the concentration of electrons (or holes) in an undoped (intrinsic) semiconductor, where $n = p = n_i$. Thus, we have established the law of mass action for semiconductors:\n$$np = n_i^2$$\nThis is the first required relation.\n\nSecond, we formulate the condition of global charge neutrality. The semiconductor is electrically neutral in its entirety. The total density of positive charge must equal the total density of negative charge. The sources of positive charge are holes (concentration $p$) and ionized donor atoms (concentration $N_D^+$). The sources of negative charge are electrons (concentration $n$) and ionized acceptor atoms (concentration $N_A^-$). The neutrality condition is therefore:\n$$p + N_D^+ = n + N_A^-$$\nThe problem specifies the assumption of complete ionization for the shallow dopants. This implies that every donor atom has lost its electron, and every acceptor atom has gained an electron. Mathematically, this means:\n$$N_D^+ = N_D$$\n$$N_A^- = N_A$$\nwhere $N_D$ and $N_A$ are the total concentrations of donor and acceptor atoms, respectively. Substituting these into the neutrality equation yields the second required relation for a compensated semiconductor with full ionization:\n$$p + N_D = n + N_A$$\n\nThird, we must solve this system of two equations for the two unknowns, $n$ and $p$:\n1. $np = n_i^2$\n2. $p + N_D = n + N_A$\n\nWe can express $p$ from the first equation as $p = \\frac{n_i^2}{n}$ and substitute it into the second equation:\n$$\\frac{n_i^2}{n} + N_D = n + N_A$$\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply the entire equation by $n$ (noting that $n \\neq 0$):\n$$n_i^2 + nN_D = n^2 + nN_A$$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with $x=n$, gives:\n$$n^2 + n(N_A - N_D) - n_i^2 = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the electron concentration $n$. We solve it using the quadratic formula, $n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b = N_A - N_D$, and $c = -n_i^2$:\n$$n = \\frac{-(N_A - N_D) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2}$$\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nSince the electron concentration $n$ is a physical quantity, it must be positive. The term under the square root, $\\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}$, is strictly greater than $|N_D - N_A|$. If we choose the negative sign, the numerator $(N_D - N_A) - \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}$ would be negative, yielding an unphysical negative concentration. Therefore, we must select the positive root:\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nThis can be written more elegantly as:\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_D - N_A}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}$$\nTo find the hole concentration $p$, we can follow a symmetrical procedure. From the neutrality equation, we express $n = p + N_D - N_A$. Substituting into the mass-action law $np = n_i^2$:\n$$(p + N_D - N_A)p = n_i^2$$\n$$p^2 + p(N_D - N_A) - n_i^2 = 0$$\nSolving this quadratic equation for $p$ yields:\n$$p = \\frac{-(N_D - N_A) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2}$$\n$$p = \\frac{N_A - N_D \\pm \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nAgain, for $p$ to be a physically meaningful positive quantity, we must take the positive root:\n$$p = \\frac{N_A - N_D + \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$p = \\frac{N_A - N_D}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_A - N_D}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}$$\nThese are the exact, closed-form expressions for the electron and hole concentrations under the given assumptions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{N_D - N_A}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_D - N_A}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}  \\frac{N_A - N_D}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_A - N_D}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2836467"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the ideal case, this exercise explores the deep connection between the mass-action product and the electronic band structure.

In the clean crystal at temperature $T$, the effective density of states in the conduction band is $N_C^0$ and in the valence band is $N_V^0$.

The derivation will proceed from the fundamental definitions of carrier concentrations under the specified physical model.\n\nFirst, we establish the expressions for the electron concentration, $n$, and hole concentration, $p$. In the non-degenerate limit (Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics), these concentrations are given by integrals of the density of states ($g_C(E)$ for the conduction band and $g_V(E)$ for the valence band) multiplied by the corresponding Boltzmann factor:\n$$n = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g_C(E) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E-E_F}{k_B T}\\right) dE$$\n$$p = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g_V(E) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F-E}{k_B T}\\right) dE$$\nwhere $E_F$ is the Fermi level, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the semiconductor is subject to two effects:\n1.  A uniform bandgap narrowing $\\Delta E_g(N) = \\beta N^{1/3}$, which reduces the bandgap from $E_g^0$ to $E_g'(N) = E_g^0 - \\Delta E_g(N)$. We can represent this by shifting the clean-crystal band edges $E_C^0$ and $E_V^0$ to new average positions, $E_C'$ and $E_V'$, such that $E_C' - E_V' = E_g'(N)$. The specific partitioning of $\\Delta E_g(N)$ between the conduction and valence bands is not required for the final product $n(N)p(N)$.\n2.  Local potential fluctuations that cause the band edges to vary randomly. These are modeled as independent Gaussian random shifts, $\\delta E_C$ and $\\delta E_V$, around the mean edges $E_C'$ and $E_V'$. The distributions for these shifts have zero mean, $\\langle \\delta E_C \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle \\delta E_V \\rangle = 0$, and standard deviations $\\sigma_C(N) = \\alpha_C \\sqrt{N}$ and $\\sigma_V(N) = \\alpha_V \\sqrt{N}$.\n\nThe total carrier concentration is the average of the local carrier concentration over the spatial distribution of these potential fluctuations. Let us first find the local electron concentration, $n_{loc}$, at a point where the conduction band edge is $E_{C,loc} = E_C' + \\delta E_C$.
