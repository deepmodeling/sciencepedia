This exercise provides practice in applying the two foundational pillars of semiconductor statistics—the principle of charge neutrality and the law of mass action—to a compensated material containing both donors and acceptors.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of semiconductor physics, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data, and free of ambiguity. The calculation of carrier concentrations from specified doping levels and thermal equilibrium conditions is a standard, formalizable problem.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying two fundamental principles that govern carrier concentrations in a semiconductor at thermal equilibrium: the charge neutrality condition and the law of mass action.\n\nFirst, the charge neutrality condition requires that the total positive charge density must equal the total negative charge density. The positive charges are holes (with concentration $p_{0}$) and ionized donor atoms (with concentration $N_{D}^{+}$). The negative charges are free electrons (with concentration $n_{0}$) and ionized acceptor atoms (with concentration $N_{A}^{-}$). The general form of the charge neutrality equation is:\n$$p_{0} + N_{D}^{+} = n_{0} + N_{A}^{-}$$\nThe problem specifies that the donors and acceptors are shallow and that ionization is complete at room temperature. This is a standard and valid assumption for common dopants in GaAs at $300\\ \\mathrm{K}$. Complete ionization implies that every donor atom has donated an electron, and every acceptor atom has accepted an electron. Therefore, the concentration of ionized donors equals the total donor concentration, $N_{D}^{+} = N_{D}$, and the concentration of ionized acceptors equals the total acceptor concentration, $N_{A}^{-} = N_{A}$. Substituting these into the charge neutrality equation yields:\n$$p_{0} + N_{D} = n_{0} + N_{A}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the difference between the electron and hole concentrations in terms of the net doping:\n$$n_{0} - p_{0} = N_{D} - N_{A}$$\nThis type of material, where both donors and acceptors are present, is known as a compensated semiconductor. The effective doping is determined by the difference between the donor and acceptor concentrations.\n\nSecond, for a nondegenerate semiconductor in thermal equilibrium, the law of mass action states that the product of the electron and hole concentrations is a constant, equal to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_{i}$.\n$$n_{0} p_{0} = n_{i}^{2}$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $n_{0}$ and $p_{0}$:\n$1.$ $n_{0} - p_{0} = N_{D} - N_{A}$\n$2.$ $n_{0} p_{0} = n_{i}^{2}$\n\nWe can solve this system to find the carrier concentrations. From equation $2$, we express $p_{0}$ in terms of $n_{0}$:\n$$p_{0} = \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{n_{0}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $p_{0}$ into equation $1$:\n$$n_{0} - \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{n_{0}} = N_{D} - N_{A}$$\nMultiplying the entire equation by $n_{0}$ (which is non-zero) to eliminate the fraction gives a quadratic equation for $n_{0}$:\n$$n_{0}^{2} - (N_{D} - N_{A})n_{0} - n_{i}^{2} = 0$$\nThis is a standard quadratic equation of the form $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$, with $x = n_{0}$, $a=1$, $b = -(N_{D} - N_{A})$, and $c = -n_{i}^{2}$. The solution is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$n_{0} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{(N_{D} - N_{A}) \\pm \\sqrt{(-(N_{D} - N_{A}))^{2} - 4(1)(-n_{i}^{2})}}{2}$$\n$$n_{0} = \\frac{(N_{D} - N_{A}) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_{D} - N_{A})^{2} + 4n_{i}^{2}}}{2}$$\nSince the carrier concentration $n_{0}$ must be a positive physical quantity, we must choose the positive sign. The term $\\sqrt{(N_{D} - N_{A})^{2} + 4n_{i}^{2}}$ is strictly greater than $|N_{D} - N_{A}|$. Choosing the negative sign would result in a negative value for $n_{0}$, which is unphysical.

The solution requires applying the principles of semiconductor statistics, including charge neutrality and the law of mass action, under the assumption of non-degenerate statistics and complete ionization of dopants.\n\nFirst, as requested, we derive the expressions for the electron concentration $n$ and the hole concentration $p$. The concentration of electrons in the conduction band is given by the integral of the density of states $g_c(E)$ times the Fermi-Dirac probability distribution $f(E)$ over the entire conduction band:\n$$n = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} g_c(E) f(E) dE$$\nwhere $E_c$ is the energy of the conduction band minimum.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for an estimate of the central-cell correction to the ground-state energy of a donor in silicon. We are given the total Hamiltonian as a sum of two terms: a long-range effective mass Hamiltonian, $H_{\\mathrm{EMA}}$, and a short-range central-cell correction potential, $V_{\\mathrm{cc}}$.\n$$H = H_{\\mathrm{EMA}} + V_{\\mathrm{cc}}$$\nThe eigenvalues of $H_{\\mathrm{EMA}}$ correspond to the hydrogenic model of the donor. The ground-state energy of this unperturbed system, $E_{0}^{\\mathrm{EMA}}$, is related to the predicted hydrogenic binding energy, $E_{B}^{\\mathrm{hyd}}$, by $E_{0}^{\\mathrm{EMA}} = -E_{B}^{\\mathrm{hyd}}$. Binding energy is defined as the positive energy required to promote the bound electron to the bottom of the conduction band (which is the zero of our energy scale).\nGiven $E_{B}^{\\mathrm{hyd}} = 31\\ \\mathrm{meV}$, the unperturbed ground-state energy is:\n$$E_{0}^{\\mathrm{EMA}} = -31\\ \\mathrm{meV}$$\nThe full Hamiltonian, $H$, includes the central-cell correction. Its ground-state eigenvalue, $E_{0}^{\\mathrm{meas}}$, corresponds to the experimentally observed state. This energy is related to the measured binding energy, $E_{B}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 45\\ \\mathrm{meV}$, by:\n$$E_{0}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = -E_{B}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = -45\\ \\mathrm{meV}$$\nThe problem states that $V_{\\mathrm{cc}}$ is a short-range perturbation. This suggests that a sensible estimate for its effect on the ground-state energy can be obtained from first-order perturbation theory. The first-order correction to the ground-state energy, which we denote as $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{cc}}$, is the expectation value of the perturbing potential $V_{\\mathrm{cc}}$ in the unperturbed ground state $\\psi_{0}^{\\mathrm{EMA}}$:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{cc}} = \\langle \\psi_{0}^{\\mathrm{EMA}} | V_{\\mathrm{cc}} | \\psi_{0}^{\\mathrm{EMA}} \\rangle$$\nThe corrected ground-state energy is then approximated as the sum of the unperturbed energy and this first-order correction:\n$$E_{0}^{\\mathrm{meas}} \\approx E_{0}^{\\mathrm{EMA}} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{cc}}$$\nThis equation defines the central-cell correction $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{cc}}$ as the difference between the measured and the EMA-predicted ground-state energies. We can compute its value directly:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{cc}} = E_{0}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - E_{0}^{\\mathrm{EMA}} = (-45\\ \\mathrm{meV}) - (-31\\ \\mathrm{meV}) = -14\\ \\mathrm{meV}$$\nThe correction to the energy level is negative, which signifies that the central-cell potential is attractive, making the electron more tightly bound and lowering its energy. The problem asks for the *magnitude* of this correction.\n$$|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{cc}}| = |-14\\ \\mathrm{meV}| = 14\\ \\mathrm{meV}$$\n\nThe physical origin of this central-cell correction is multifaceted, arising from the failure of the simple effective mass approximation at short distances from the impurity core. The key contributing factors are:\n\n$1$. **Valley-Orbit Coupling:** The conduction band of silicon does not have its minimum at the center of the Brillouin zone ($\\Gamma$-point), but rather has $6$ equivalent minima, or \"valleys,\" along the $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ crystallographic directions. In the simple EMA, the donor ground state is constructed from wavefunctions associated with these $6$ valleys, and these states are degenerate. However, the central-cell potential $V_{\\mathrm{cc}}$ is highly localized in real space, meaning its Fourier transform is broad in momentum space. This potential can scatter an electron between different valleys (inter-valley scattering), an effect known as valley-orbit coupling. This coupling lifts the $6$-fold degeneracy of the ground state, splitting it into states of different symmetries dictated by the tetrahedral symmetry of the impurity site. The lowest-energy resulting state is a fully symmetric singlet ($A_1$ symmetry), which has a large wavefunction amplitude at the impurity nucleus. Because it samples the short-range attractive potential most strongly, its energy is lowered significantly relative to the other states and relative to the initial degenerate EMA level. This is the dominant contribution to the increased binding energy.\n\n$2$. **Breakdown of Macroscopic Dielectric Screening:** The EMA potential uses the bulk static dielectric constant, $\\epsilon_r \\approx 11.7$ for silicon, to model the screening of the impurity's nuclear charge by the host lattice ($V(r) \\propto 1/(\\epsilon_r r)$). This is an approximation valid only at distances large compared to the lattice constant. At very short distances from the impurity core, the concept of a uniform dielectric medium is invalid. The screening is less effective, and the potential becomes stronger, approaching the bare Coulomb potential of an unscreened charge ($V(r) \\propto 1/r$). Since the electron's ground-state wavefunction is non-zero at the origin ($r=0$), it experiences this deeper, less-screened potential, which further increases the binding energy.\n\n$3$. **Chemical Differences (Impurity-Core Effects):** The substitutional donor (e.g., phosphorus, arsenic) is a different chemical element than the host silicon atom it replaces. The ionic core of the donor is not identical to the Si core. It has a different number of protons and a different arrangement of core electrons. This difference in the chemical nature and electronic structure of the impurity core itself contributes a short-range potential that is not captured by the simple point-charge model of EMA. This \"chemical shift\" is specific to each donor species, which explains why different group-V donors (P, As, Sb) have distinct experimental binding energies in silicon, whereas the simple EMA would predict the same value for all of them.\n\nThe sign of the correction is consistently negative for the energy level (and thus positive for the binding energy) because all three effects describe a potential that is more attractive at short range than the simple $-e^2/(4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\epsilon_r r)$ potential. This deeper potential well results in a more tightly bound ground state, i.e., a larger binding energy. The magnitude, calculated here as $14\\ \\mathrm{meV}$, is a substantial fraction of the EMA binding energy ($14/31 \\approx 45\\%$), highlighting that central-cell effects are not a minor perturbation but a crucial component for accurately describing donors in silicon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14}$$", "id": "2988767"}]}
