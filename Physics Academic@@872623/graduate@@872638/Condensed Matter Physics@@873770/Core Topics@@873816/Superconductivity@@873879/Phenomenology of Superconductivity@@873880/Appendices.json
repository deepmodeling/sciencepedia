A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Equilibrium Free Energy Density**\n\nThe Ginzburg-Landau free energy density difference between the superconducting ($s$) and normal ($n$) states is given by\n$$\n\\Delta f = f_{s} - f_{n} = a(T)\\,|\\psi|^{2} + \\frac{b}{2}\\,|\\psi|^{4} + \\kappa\\,|\\nabla \\psi|^{2}\n$$\nThe problem states that we assume spatial uniformity, which implies the gradient of the order parameter is zero, $\\nabla \\psi = 0$. The expression for the free energy density difference simplifies to\n$$\n\\Delta f = a(T)\\,|\\psi|^{2} + \\frac{b}{2}\\,|\\psi|^{4}\n$$\nThe equilibrium state corresponds to the value of the order parameter $\\psi$ that minimizes this free energy density. To find this minimum, we differentiate $\\Delta f$ with respect to $|\\psi|$ and set the result to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(\\Delta f)}{\\partial |\\psi|} = 2a(T)\\,|\\psi| + 2b\\,|\\psi|^{3} = 2|\\psi|\\,(a(T) + b\\,|\\psi|^{2}) = 0\n$$\nThis equation yields two possible solutions for the equilibrium value of $|\\psi|$, denoted as $|\\psi|_{0}$:\n1.  $|\\psi|_{0} = 0$. This is the trivial solution, corresponding to the normal state.\n2.  $|\\psi|_{0}^{2} = -\\frac{a(T)}{b}$. This is the non-trivial solution.\n\nTo determine which solution corresponds to a stable minimum, we examine the second derivative of $\\Delta f$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}(\\Delta f)}{(\\partial |\\psi|)^{2}} = 2a(T) + 6b\\,|\\psi|^{2}\n$$\nThe problem is concerned with the superconducting phase, which exists for temperatures $T  T_{c}$. In this regime, $a(T) = a_{0}(T - T_{c})  0$.\n\n-   For the trivial solution, $|\\psi|_{0} = 0$, the second derivative is $2a(T)$. Since $a(T)  0$ for $T  T_{c}$, the second derivative is negative. This indicates a local maximum, so the normal state is unstable below $T_{c}$.\n-   For the non-trivial solution, $|\\psi|_{0}^{2} = -\\frac{a(T)}{b}$, this value is positive since $a(T)  0$ and $b  0$. The second derivative at this point is\n    $$\n    \\left.\\frac{\\partial^{2}(\\Delta f)}{(\\partial |\\psi|)^{2}}\\right|_{|\\psi|^{2}=-a/b} = 2a(T) + 6b\\left(-\\frac{a(T)}{b}\\right) = 2a(T) - 6a(T) = -4a(T)\n    $$\n    Since $a(T)  0$ for $T  T_{c}$, the second derivative $-4a(T)$ is positive. This indicates a stable minimum.\n\nTherefore, for $T  T_{c}$, the equilibrium value of the order parameter is given by $|\\psi|_{0}^{2} = -\\frac{a(T)}{b}$. We substitute this value back into the expression for $\\Delta f$ to find the equilibrium free energy density difference:\n$$\n\\Delta f_{\\text{eq}} = a(T)\\left(-\\frac{a(T)}{b}\\right) + \\frac{b}{2}\\left(-\\frac{a(T)}{b}\\right)^{2} = -\\frac{a(T)^{2}}{b} + \\frac{b}{2}\\frac{a(T)^{2}}{b^{2}} = -\\frac{a(T)^{2}}{b} + \\frac{a(T)^{2}}{2b}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the equilibrium free energy density difference for $T  T_{c}$:\n$$\n\\Delta f_{\\text{eq}} = -\\frac{a(T)^{2}}{2b}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Specific Heat Jump**\n\nThe specific heat per unit volume is defined as $C = -T\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial T^{2}}$. We need to compute the specific heats for the superconducting ($C_{s}$) and normal ($C_{n}$) states.\n\nThe free energy of the normal state is $f_{n}$. Its specific heat is $C_{n} = -T\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{n}}{\\partial T^{2}}$. This serves as our baseline.\n\nFor $T  T_{c}$, the system is in the superconducting state, and its equilibrium free energy density is $f_{s}(T) = f_{n}(T) + \\Delta f_{\\text{eq}}(T)$. Using the result from Part 1 and the given form of $a(T) = a_{0}(T-T_{c})$:\n$$\nf_{s}(T) = f_{n}(T) - \\frac{\\left[a_{0}(T-T_{c})\\right]^{2}}{2b} = f_{n}(T) - \\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{2b}(T-T_{c})^{2}\n$$\nTo find $C_{s}$, we compute the second derivative of $f_{s}$ with respect to temperature $T$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_{s}}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial f_{n}}{\\partial T} - \\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{2b} \\cdot 2(T-T_{c}) = \\frac{\\partial f_{n}}{\\partial T} - \\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{b}(T-T_{c})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{s}}{\\partial T^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{n}}{\\partial T^{2}} - \\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{b}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the specific heat of the superconducting state, $C_{s}$:\n$$\nC_{s} = -T\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{s}}{\\partial T^{2}} = -T\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{n}}{\\partial T^{2}} - \\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{b}\\right) = -T\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{n}}{\\partial T^{2}} + \\frac{T a_{0}^{2}}{b}\n$$\nRecognizing that $C_{n} = -T\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{n}}{\\partial T^{2}}$, we have:\n$$\nC_{s}(T) = C_{n}(T) + \\frac{T a_{0}^{2}}{b} \\quad (\\text{for } T  T_{c})\n$$\nThe difference in specific heats for $T  T_{c}$ is therefore:\n$$\nC_{s}(T) - C_{n}(T) = \\frac{T a_{0}^{2}}{b}\n$$\nThe problem defines the specific heat jump as the limit as temperature approaches $T_{c}$ from below:\n$$\n\\Delta C \\equiv \\lim_{T \\to T_{c}^{-}} \\left(C_{s} - C_{n}\\right)\n$$\nEvaluating this limit:\n$$\n\\Delta C = \\lim_{T \\to T_{c}^{-}} \\left(\\frac{T a_{0}^{2}}{b}\\right) = \\frac{T_{c} a_{0}^{2}}{b}\n$$\nFor $T  T_{c}$, the system is in the normal state ($|\\psi|_{0}=0$), so $\\Delta f = 0$, which means $f_{s}=f_{n}$ and $C_{s}=C_{n}$. Thus, $C_{s}-C_{n}=0$ for $TT_{c}$. The result for $\\Delta C$ represents the finite discontinuity in the specific heat at the second-order phase transition temperature $T_{c}$.\n\nThe two results requested are the equilibrium free energy density difference for $T  T_{c}$ and the specific heat jump at $T_{c}$.\n1.  $\\Delta f_{\\text{eq}} = -\\frac{a(T)^{2}}{2b}$\n2.  $\\Delta C = \\frac{a_{0}^{2} T_{c}}{b}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\frac{a(T)^{2}}{2b}  \\frac{a_{0}^{2} T_{c}}{b}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3009560"}, {"introduction": "Phenomenological observables like the London penetration depth are not just bulk properties; they are sensitive probes of the microscopic electronic structure.

There are no internal contradictions in the problem setup.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and consistent. The solution will proceed by deriving the correct answer based on the theory of superconductivity.\n\n**Theoretical Framework**\n\nIn the local London theory, the magnetic penetration depth $\\lambda$ is related to the superfluid density $n_s$ by\n$$ \\lambda^2 = \\frac{m^*}{\\mu_0 n_s e^2} $$\nwhere $m^*$ is the effective mass of the Cooper pairs. At zero temperature, $T=0$, all charge carriers are in the superfluid condensate, so $n_s(0)=n$. At finite temperature $T > 0$, thermal excitations create quasiparticles, which constitute a \"normal fluid\" component with density $n_n(T)$. This reduces the superfluid density: $n_s(T) = n_s(0) - n_n(T)$. The temperature dependence of $\\lambda$ is thus given by\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda^2(0)}{\\lambda^2(T)} = \\frac{n_s(T)}{n_s(0)} = 1 - \\frac{n_n(T)}{n_s(0)} $$\nFor low temperatures ($T \\ll T_c$), $n_n(T) \\ll n_s(0)$, and we can expand $\\lambda(T)$:\n$$ \\lambda(T) = \\lambda(0) \\left( 1 - \\frac{n_n(T)}{n_s(0)} \\right)^{-1/2} \\approx \\lambda(0) \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{n_n(T)}{n_s(0)} \\right) $$\nThis gives the change in penetration depth as\n$$ \\Delta\\lambda(T) = \\lambda(T) - \\lambda(0) \\approx \\frac{\\lambda(0)}{2} \\frac{n_n(T)}{n_s(0)} $$\nThe temperature dependence of $\\Delta\\lambda(T)$ is therefore determined by the temperature dependence of the normal fluid density, $n_n(T)$. The density $n_n(T)$ is governed by the number of thermally excited quasiparticles, which in turn depends critically on the quasiparticle density of states (DOS), $N(E)$, at low energies ($E \\sim k_B T$). More formally, the change in the inverse-square penetration depth, $\\Delta(\\lambda^{-2}) \\equiv \\lambda^{-2}(T) - \\lambda^{-2}(0)$, is proportional to the temperature-dependent part of the normal fluid density, and its low-temperature behavior is a direct probe of the low-energy excitation spectrum.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A) The linear-in-$ T $ behavior of $ \\Delta \\lambda(T) $ at low $ T $ implies the presence of line nodes in the superconducting energy gap on the Fermi surface.**\nFor a superconductor with line nodes in its gap (e.g., a $d$-wave superconductor), the energy gap $\\Delta(\\mathbf{k})$ goes to zero along certain lines on the Fermi surface. This allows for low-energy quasiparticle excitations. The low-energy DOS for such a system is found to be linear in energy: $N(E) \\propto E$. Microscopic calculations for a clean system with line nodes show that the temperature-dependent change in the superfluid density, and thus $\\Delta(\\lambda^{-2})$, is linear in temperature for $T \\ll T_c$: $\\Delta(\\lambda^{-2}) \\propto -T$. Using the expansion $\\Delta\\lambda(T) \\approx -\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^3(0) \\Delta(\\lambda^{-2})$, we find $\\Delta\\lambda(T) \\propto T$. Conversely, a fully gapped superconductor gives an exponential dependence, and a superconductor with point nodes ($N(E) \\propto E^2$) gives a $T^2$ dependence for $\\Delta\\lambda(T)$. The observed linear behavior is the primary signature of line nodes.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B) In this system, adding weak nonmagnetic impurities that do not change $ T_c $ leaves the low-$ T $ linear behavior unchanged by Anderson’s theorem; thus $ \\Delta \\lambda(T) \\propto T $ persists as $ T \\to 0 $.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Anderson's theorem states that nonmagnetic impurities do not affect the thermodynamic properties (like $T_c$) of conventional, isotropic $s$-wave superconductors. This is because scattering by a time-reversal symmetric potential does not break Cooper pairs if the gap function $\\Delta(\\mathbf{k})$ is constant. However, for a nodal superconductor like the one implied here (e.g., $d$-wave), the gap function changes sign across the nodal lines ($\\Delta(-\\mathbf{k}) = \\Delta(\\mathbf{k})$ but $\\Delta(k_x,k_y) = -\\Delta(k_y,k_x)$). Impurity scattering can connect regions of the Fermi surface with opposite signs of the gap, which is a pair-breaking process. This pair-breaking suppresses $T_c$ and qualitatively changes the low-energy physics. It induces a finite, residual DOS at the Fermi level, $N(0)  0$. The consequence for penetration depth is a crossover to a $\\Delta\\lambda(T) \\propto T^2$ behavior at sufficiently low temperatures. Therefore, Anderson's theorem is misapplied, and the linear-in-$T$ behavior does not persist to $T=0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C) In a fully gapped isotropic $ s $-wave superconductor, $ \\Delta \\lambda(T) $ should vary as $ \\exp(-\\Delta_0/k_B T) $ at low $ T $, not linearly.**\nIn a fully gapped superconductor, there is a minimum energy $\\Delta_0  0$ required to create a quasiparticle excitation. At low temperatures, $k_B T \\ll \\Delta_0$, the number of thermally excited quasiparticles is exponentially suppressed by a Boltzmann-like factor. The normal fluid density will be proportional to this factor: $n_n(T) \\propto \\exp(-\\Delta_0/k_B T)$. As shown in the theoretical framework, $\\Delta\\lambda(T) \\propto n_n(T)$ at low $T$. Therefore, the temperature dependence of $\\Delta\\lambda(T)$ is exponential. This statement correctly describes the behavior for a standard BCS-type $s$-wave superconductor and contrasts it with the observed behavior.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D) For a nodal superconductor with nonmagnetic impurity scattering in the unitary or intermediate limit, a crossover at a scale $ T^\\star $ to $ \\Delta \\lambda(T) \\propto T^2 $ is expected at sufficiently low $ T $, together with an increase of $ \\lambda(0) $ due to suppression of the superfluid density.**\nThis statement accurately describes the two primary effects of nonmagnetic impurities in a nodal superconductor. First, the pair-breaking scattering induces a finite density of states at zero energy, $N(0)$. This residual normal-fluid component at $T=0$ reduces the superfluid density $n_s(0)$ compared to the clean limit. Since $\\lambda(0) \\propto 1/\\sqrt{n_s(0)}$, a smaller $n_s(0)$ results in a larger $\\lambda(0)$. Second, the finite $N(0)$ modifies the low-temperature thermodynamics. The thermal excitation of quasiparticles from this constant DOS leads to a change in the superfluid density that is proportional to $T^2$. This results in $\\Delta\\lambda(T) \\propto T^2$ for temperatures below a crossover scale $T^\\star$, which is determined by the impurity scattering rate. Above $T^\\star$, the system recovers the clean-limit linear-in-$T$ behavior. The statement is fully consistent with established theory.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E) Nonmagnetic impurities in a nodal superconductor generically lift the nodes and produce an exponential temperature dependence of $ \\Delta \\lambda(T) $ at asymptotically low $ T $.**\nThis is incorrect. Nonmagnetic impurities in a d-wave superconductor do not \"lift the nodes\" to open a full gap. Instead, they induce states *within* the gap, leading to a \"gapless\" state characterized by a finite DOS at zero energy, $N(0)  0$. An exponential temperature dependence requires a finite minimum excitation energy (a hard gap), which is precisely what is absent in this impurity-induced state. The presence of states at arbitrarily low energy leads to power-law temperature dependencies, not an exponential one. As described in the analysis of (D), the expected asymptotic behavior is $\\Delta\\lambda(T) \\propto T^2$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F) The linear-in-$ T $ coefficient $ \\mathrm{d}\\lambda/\\mathrm{d}T $ in the clean nodal limit scales with the nodal quasiparticle spectrum and is proportional to $ \\lambda(0) $ divided by the slope of the gap at the node; therefore, knowledge of $ \\lambda(0) = 120\\,\\mathrm{nm} $ alone is insufficient to predict the numerical value of the coefficient.**\nThe rate of change of the penetration depth with temperature in the clean limit for a d-wave superconductor is given by the relation:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda(T)}{\\mathrm{d}T}\\bigg|_{T\\to 0} = \\lambda(0) \\frac{k_B \\ln{2}}{\\Delta_0} $$\nwhere $\\Delta_0$ is the maximum amplitude of the energy gap. The \"slope of the gap at the node\" (in momentum space), which can be denoted $v_\\Delta$, is directly proportional to the maximum gap, i.e., $v_\\Delta \\propto \\Delta_0$. Thus, the statement that the coefficient $\\mathrm{d}\\lambda/\\mathrm{d}T$ is proportional to $\\lambda(0)$ divided by the gap slope is correct. To calculate the numerical value of this coefficient, one would need to know both $\\lambda(0)$ and $\\Delta_0$ (or $v_\\Delta$). Since $\\Delta_0$ is a material-specific parameter related to the strength of the pairing interaction and details of the electronic structure, knowledge of $\\lambda(0)$ alone is indeed insufficient.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDF}$$", "id": "3009575"}, {"introduction": "While analytic theory provides the essential framework, much of modern condensed matter physics relies on computational modeling to connect theory with experimental data.

Key elements are:\n    1. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) is suppressed by a spin-flip scattering rate ($\\Gamma_s$) according to the AG equation: $\\ln(T_{c0}/T_c) = \\psi(1/2 + \\Gamma_s/(2\\pi T_c)) - \\psi(1/2)$, where $T_{c0}$ is the clean-limit transition temperature and $\\psi$ is the digamma function.\n    2. The specific heat jump at $T_c$, $\\Delta C$, is derived from the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy expansion, whose coefficients are determined from microscopic theory (Matsubara formalism). These coefficients are given as sums expressible via polygamma functions.\n    3. The pair-breaking rate is proportional to impurity concentration $c$: $\\Gamma_s = \\alpha c$.\n- **Modeling and Inference Objective**:\n    1. Implement a model to calculate the normalized specific heat jump, $\\Delta C/(\\gamma T_c)$, as a function of $c$, by first solving for $T_c$ from the AG equation and then evaluating the jump using the GL coefficients.\n    2. Synthesize a dataset of $\\{\\Delta C/(\\gamma T_c)\\}_i$ versus $\\{c_i\\}$ using a known \"true\" value, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}$.\n    3. Fit the model to this synthetic data to recover the parameter $\\alpha$.\n    4. Report the inferred values of $\\Gamma_s$ for all non-zero concentrations using the fitted $\\alpha$.\n- **Units and Conventions**: Boltzmann's constant $k_B=1$. Temperatures and energies (including $\\Gamma_s$) are in Kelvin. Concentration $c$ is dimensionless.\n- **Numerical Requirements**: Use root-finding for the AG equation and a 1D minimization/least-squares method for fitting $\\alpha$.\n- **Test Cases**: Three cases are provided with specific values for $T_{c0}$, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}$, and a set of concentrations $\\{c_i\\}$.\n    - Case A: $T_{c0} = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 20.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $c \\in \\{0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20\\}$.\n    - Case B: $T_{c0} = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $c \\in \\{0.0, 0.02, 0.05\\}$.\n    - Case C: $T_{c0} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 30.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $c \\in \\{0.0, 0.10, 0.20\\}$.\n- **Output Specification**: A single list of the inferred $\\Gamma_s$ values (in Kelvin) for all nonzero concentrations, ordered by case and then by concentration, formatted to six decimal places.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is based entirely on the established and standard Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory for superconductors with magnetic impurities, a cornerstone of condensed matter physics. The methods described (Ginzburg-Landau theory, Matsubara sums, polygamma functions) are the correct and standard tools for this problem. The physics is sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters and defines a clear, sequential path from model building to parameter inference. The physical relationship between the model parameter $\\alpha$ and the observable (specific heat jump) is monotonic, ensuring that a unique fit can be found.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms, free of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. The provided test case parameters are physically realistic and do not lead to corner cases like the complete destruction of superconductivity, ensuring that a meaningful solution exists for each point.\n5.  **Triviality**: The problem is not trivial. It requires a non-trivial implementation of several interconnected concepts from theoretical physics and their numerical evaluation, including root-finding and optimization. The requirement to build the model from first principles and then use it for fitting constitutes a substantive task in computational physics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided based on the principles outlined.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe solution requires implementing the Abrikosov-Gor'kov (AG) theory for magnetic impurities in a superconductor. The core tasks are to model the suppression of the transition temperature ($T_c$) and the change in the specific heat jump ($\\Delta C$) due to a spin-flip scattering rate $\\Gamma_s$, and then to use this model to infer $\\Gamma_s$ from mock experimental data.\n\n### Theoretical Formulation\n\n1.  **Transition Temperature $T_c$**: The AG equation relates the suppressed transition temperature $T_c$ to the clean limit temperature $T_{c0}$ and the pair-breaking rate $\\Gamma_s$:\n    $$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{c0}}{T_c}\\right) = \\psi\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\Gamma_s}{2\\pi T_c}\\right) - \\psi\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\n    Here, $\\psi(z)$ is the digamma function. This transcendental equation must be solved numerically for $T_c$ for any given $\\Gamma_s > 0$. For $\\Gamma_s = 0$, $T_c = T_{c0}$.\n\n2.  **Normalized Specific Heat Jump $\\Delta C / (\\gamma T_c)$**: The specific heat jump at $T_c$ is obtained from the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coefficients. In the microscopic theory, the jump normalized by the normal-state electronic specific heat coefficient $\\gamma$ and $T_c$ is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\gamma T_c} = \\frac{24\\left(1 - \\rho_c \\psi^{(1)}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\rho_c\\right)\\right)^2}{-\\psi^{(2)}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\rho_c\\right)} $$\n    where $\\rho_c = \\frac{\\Gamma_s}{2\\pi T_c}$, and $\\psi^{(n)}(z)$ is the polygamma function of order $n$.\n    - In the clean limit ($\\Gamma_s \\to 0$, so $\\rho_c \\to 0$ and $T_c \\to T_{c0}$), this expression recovers the universal BCS value of $\\frac{12}{7\\zeta(3)} \\approx 1.426$.\n\n3.  **Parameter Inference**: The problem requires inferring the proportionality constant $\\alpha$ from the relation $\\Gamma_s = \\alpha c$, where $c$ is the impurity concentration. This is a one-dimensional optimization problem. We must find the value of $\\alpha$ that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the model's predictions for $\\Delta C/(\\gamma T_c)$ and the provided synthetic data.\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\nThe program will be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **`solve_ag_equation(T_c0, Gamma_s)`**: A function to find $T_c$ by numerically solving the AG equation using a root-finder (`scipy.optimize.brentq`) on the interval $(0, T_{c0}]$. It handles the clean limit ($\\Gamma_s=0$) as a special case.\n\n2.  **`calculate_normalized_jump(Tc, Gamma_s)`**: A function that implements the formula for the normalized specific heat jump using polygamma functions from `scipy.special`. It handles the clean limit and the case where superconductivity is destroyed ($T_c=0$).\n\n3.  **Model and Fitting Loop**:\n    - For each test case, we first generate synthetic \"measurement\" data for the normalized jump at each concentration using the given $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}$.\n    - An objective function is defined, which computes the sum of squared residuals between the model predictions (as a function of a trial $\\alpha$) and the synthetic data.\n    - `scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar` is used to find the `alpha_fit` that minimizes this objective function.\n    - The final inferred pair-breaking rates are calculated as $\\Gamma_s = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{fit}} \\cdot c$ for each non-zero concentration.\n\n4.  **Output**: The collected $\\Gamma_s$ values from all test cases are formatted into a single string as specified. Since the synthetic data is noiseless and the model used for fitting is identical to the one that generated the data, the fitted $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{fit}}$ should be equal to $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}$ within numerical precision. Consequently, the output $\\Gamma_s$ values will correspond directly to $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} \\cdot c$.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures that the program adheres strictly to the first-principles derivation mandated by the problem.", "answer": "[1.000000,2.000000,4.000000,0.100000,0.250000,3.000000,6.000000]", "id": "3009493"}]}
