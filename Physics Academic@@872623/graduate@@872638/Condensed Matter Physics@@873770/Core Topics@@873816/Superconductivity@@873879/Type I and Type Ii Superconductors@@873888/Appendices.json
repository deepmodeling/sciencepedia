The penetration depth is the characteristic distance over which an external magnetic field decays inside the superconductor. The coherence length is the minimum length scale over which the superconducting order parameter (related to the density of superconducting electrons) can vary.\n\nThe ratio of these two lengths defines the dimensionless Ginzburg-Landau parameter, $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{\\lambda(T)}{\\xi(T)}\n$$\nThe value of $\\kappa$ is crucial for classifying superconductors. A material is classified as Type I if $\\kappa  1/\\sqrt{2}$ and Type II if $\\kappa  1/\\sqrt{2}$. The case $\\kappa = 1/\\sqrt{2}$ marks the boundary between the two types. Although the lengths themselves are temperature-dependent, their ratio $\\kappa$ is approximately constant for temperatures near the critical temperature $T_c$.

Each vortex carries a magnetic flux of $\\Phi_0$. If the number of vortices per unit area (the vortex density) is $n_v$, then the total magnetic flux passing through a unit area is simply the product of the vortex density and the flux per vortex.
