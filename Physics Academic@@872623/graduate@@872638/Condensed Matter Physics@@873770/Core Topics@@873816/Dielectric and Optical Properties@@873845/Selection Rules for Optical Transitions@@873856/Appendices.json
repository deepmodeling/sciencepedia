This integral is directly related to Wigner $3j$-symbols through the Gaunt integral formula. Using the property $Y_{l'm'}^*(\\theta,\\phi) = (-1)^{m'}Y_{l',-m'}(\\theta,\\phi)$, the angular integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} Y_{l'm'}^* Y_{1,q} Y_{lm} d\\Omega = (-1)^{m'} \\int_{\\Omega} Y_{l',-m'} Y_{1,q} Y_{lm} d\\Omega $$\nThe integral of a product of three spherical harmonics is given by:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} Y_{l_1 m_1} Y_{l_2 m_2} Y_{l_3 m_3} d\\Omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{(2l_1+1)(2l_2+1)(2l_3+1)}{4\\pi}} \\begin{pmatrix} l_1 & l_2 & l_3 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} l_1 & l_2 & l_3 \\\\ m_1 & m_2 & m_3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nApplying this formula with $(l_1, m_1) = (l', -m')$, $(l_2, m_2) = (1, q)$, and $(l_3, m_3) = (l, m)$, we obtain:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} Y_{l'm'}^* Y_{1,q} Y_{lm} d\\Omega = (-1)^{m'} \\sqrt{\\frac{(2l'+1)(3)(2l+1)}{4\\pi}} \\begin{pmatrix} l' & 1 & l \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} l' & 1 & l \\\\ -m' & q & m \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe angular part of the matrix element, $\\mathcal{A}_q$, is this integral multiplied by the factor $\\sqrt{4\\pi/3}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{A}_q = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi}{3}} \\left( (-1)^{m'} \\sqrt{\\frac{3(2l'+1)(2l+1)}{4\\pi}} \\begin{pmatrix} l' & 1 & l \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} l' & 1 & l \\\\ -m' & q & m \\end{pmatrix} \\right) $$\n$$ \\mathcal{A}_q = (-1)^{m'} \\sqrt{(2l'+1)(2l+1)} \\begin{pmatrix} l' & 1 & l \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} l' & 1 & l \\\\ -m' & q & m \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis expression is the closed form for the angular part of the matrix element, as requested.\n\nThe dipole selection rules are the conditions under which this expression is non-zero.

The symbol $\\begin{pmatrix} l' & 1 & l \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ is non-zero only if the sum of the top row numbers, $l' + 1 + l$, is an even integer. This corresponds to the parity selection rule. The parity of the state $|lm\\rangle$ is $(-1)^l$. For the matrix element $\\langle l'm'|\\mathbf{r}|lm\\rangle$ to be non-zero, the overall parity of the integrand must be even. The operator $\\mathbf{r}$ has odd parity ($-1$), so we require $(-1)^{l'} (-1)^1 (-1)^l = 1$, which means $l'+l+1$ must be even.

Since $l'+1+l$ is even for allowed transitions, this simplifies to $\\begin{pmatrix} l & 1 & l' \\\\ m & q & -m' \\end{pmatrix}$.

The FGR expression is standard for electric-dipole transitions. The definitions of symmetries and circular dichroism are correct.\n\nThere is a subtle point of consistency.

However, we can proceed by interpreting the problem in one of two ways:\n1.  It describes a theoretical model of spinless particles, for which the nondegeneracy condition is not in conflict with the symmetries.\n2.  The nondegeneracy is a condition that may arise after a symmetry is broken, and the question is about the properties of transitions between such resultant bands.\n\nUnder the first interpretation (spinless model), the problem is self-contained and scientifically valid, although idealized. We will proceed under this interpretation, as it allows for a direct analysis of the provided FGR expression and its symmetry implications. The problem is well-posed and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** under the interpretation of a spinless model. We will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nWe seek to evaluate the circular dichroism, $W_{+}(\\omega) - W_{-}(\\omega)$, which is nonzero if $W_{+}(\\omega) \\neq W_{-}(\\omega)$. The transition rate depends on the squared matrix element $|\\mathcal{M}_{\\pm}(\\boldsymbol{k})|^2 = |\\langle c,\\boldsymbol{k} | \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\pm}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} | v,\\boldsymbol{k} \\rangle|^2$.

Then $\\mathcal{M}_{\\pm}(\\boldsymbol{k}) = \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\pm} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}_{cv}(\\boldsymbol{k})$.\n\nWe analyze the effects of the symmetries $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ on $\\boldsymbol{v}_{cv}(\\boldsymbol{k})$.\n\n1.  **Inversion Symmetry ($\\mathcal{P}$)**:\n    The inversion operator is unitary, $\\mathcal{P}^{-1} = \\mathcal{P}^\\dagger$. It acts on position and momentum as $\\mathcal{P}\\boldsymbol{r}\\mathcal{P}^{-1} = -\\boldsymbol{r}$ and $\\mathcal{P}\\boldsymbol{k}\\mathcal{P}^{-1} = -\\boldsymbol{k}$. The velocity operator $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is odd under inversion: $\\mathcal{P}\\boldsymbol{v}\\mathcal{P}^{-1} = -\\boldsymbol{v}$. For nondegenerate bands, the Bloch states transform as $\\mathcal{P}|n, \\boldsymbol{k}\\rangle = \\eta_{n\\boldsymbol{k}} |n, -\\boldsymbol{k}\\rangle$, where $\\eta_{n\\boldsymbol{k}}$ is a phase factor. We can choose a gauge such that $\\mathcal{P}|n, \\boldsymbol{k}\\rangle = |n, -\\boldsymbol{k}\\rangle$.\n    The matrix element at $-\\boldsymbol{k}$ is:\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{v}_{cv}(-\\boldsymbol{k}) = \\langle c, -\\boldsymbol{k} | \\boldsymbol{v} | v, -\\boldsymbol{k} \\rangle = \\langle \\mathcal{P}(c, \\boldsymbol{k}) | \\boldsymbol{v} | \\mathcal{P}(v, \\boldsymbol{k}) \\rangle = \\langle c, \\boldsymbol{k} | \\mathcal{P}^\\dagger \\boldsymbol{v} \\mathcal{P} | v, \\boldsymbol{k} \\rangle = \\langle c, \\boldsymbol{k} | -\\boldsymbol{v} | v, \\boldsymbol{k} \\rangle = -\\boldsymbol{v}_{cv}(\\boldsymbol{k}) $$\n    Thus, inversion symmetry implies that $\\boldsymbol{v}_{cv}(\\boldsymbol{k})$ is an odd function of $\\boldsymbol{k}$.\n\n2.  **Time-Reversal Symmetry ($\\mathcal{T}$)**:\n    The time-reversal operator $\\mathcal{T}$ is anti-unitary. It acts on momentum as $\\mathcal{T}\\boldsymbol{k}\\mathcal{T}^{-1} = -\\boldsymbol{k}$. The velocity operator is odd under time reversal: $\\mathcal{T}\\boldsymbol{v}\\mathcal{T}^{-1} = -\\boldsymbol{v}$. For nondegenerate (spinless) bands, we can choose the states such that $\\mathcal{T}|n, \\boldsymbol{k}\\rangle = |n, -\\boldsymbol{k}\\rangle$.\n    Let's analyze the matrix element $\\boldsymbol{v}_{cv}(\\boldsymbol{k})$.\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{v}_{cv}(\\boldsymbol{k}) = \\langle c, \\boldsymbol{k} | \\boldsymbol{v} | v, \\boldsymbol{k} \\rangle $$\n    Taking the complex conjugate and using the anti-unitary property $\\langle \\phi | A | \\psi \\rangle^* = \\langle \\mathcal{T}\\psi | \\mathcal{T} A^\\dagger \\mathcal{T}^{-1} | \\mathcal{T}\\phi \\rangle$:\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{v}_{cv}(\\boldsymbol{k})^* = \\langle \\mathcal{T}(v, \\boldsymbol{k}) | \\mathcal{T}\\boldsymbol{v}^\\dagger\\mathcal{T}^{-1} | \\mathcal{T}(c, \\boldsymbol{k}) \\rangle = \\langle v, -\\boldsymbol{k} | -\\boldsymbol{v} | c, -\\boldsymbol{k} \\rangle $$\n    Since $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is Hermitian, $\\langle v, -\\boldsymbol{k} | -\\boldsymbol{v} | c, -\\boldsymbol{k} \\rangle = -\\langle c, -\\boldsymbol{k} | \\boldsymbol{v} | v, -\\boldsymbol{k} \\rangle^* = -\\boldsymbol{v}_{cv}(-\\boldsymbol{k})^*$.\n    So, $\\boldsymbol{v}_{cv}(\\boldsymbol{k})^* = -\\boldsymbol{v}_{cv}(-\\boldsymbol{k})^*$, which implies $\\boldsymbol{v}_{cv}(\\boldsymbol{k}) = -\\boldsymbol{v}_{cv}(-\\boldsymbol{k})$. This reproduces the result from $\\mathcal{P}$. This is not the relation we need.\n\n    Let's derive the key relation used in the pairing argument directly.\n    $$ \\mathcal{M}_{+}(\\boldsymbol{k})^* = \\left( \\langle c, \\boldsymbol{k} | \\boldsymbol{e}_{+}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{v} | v, \\boldsymbol{k} \\rangle \\right)^* = \\langle \\mathcal{T}(v, \\boldsymbol{k}) | \\mathcal{T} (\\boldsymbol{e}_{+}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{v})^\\dagger \\mathcal{T}^{-1} | \\mathcal{T}(c, \\boldsymbol{k}) \\rangle $$\n    $(\\boldsymbol{e}_{+}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{v})^\\dagger = \\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{e}_{+}^* = \\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{e}_{-}$.\n    $\\mathcal{T}(\\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{e}_{-})\\mathcal{T}^{-1} = (\\mathcal{T}\\boldsymbol{v}\\mathcal{T}^{-1}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{e}_{-}^* = (-\\boldsymbol{v}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{e}_{+} = -\\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{e}_{+}$.\n    $$ \\mathcal{M}_{+}(\\boldsymbol{k})^* = \\langle v, -\\boldsymbol{k} |  -\\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{e}_{+} | c, -\\boldsymbol{k} \\rangle = - \\langle v, -\\boldsymbol{k} | \\boldsymbol{e}_{+}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{v} | c, -\\boldsymbol{k} \\rangle $$\n    $$ = - \\left( \\langle c, -\\boldsymbol{k} | (\\boldsymbol{e}_{+}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{v})^\\dagger | v, -\\boldsymbol{k} \\rangle \\right)^* = - \\left( \\langle c, -\\boldsymbol{k} | \\boldsymbol{e}_{-}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{v} | v, -\\boldsymbol{k} \\rangle \\right)^* = - \\mathcal{M}_{-}(-\\boldsymbol{k})^*$$\n    Thus, $\\mathcal{M}_{+}(\\boldsymbol{k}) = -\\mathcal{M}_{-}(-\\boldsymbol{k})$. Taking the magnitude squared gives:\n    $$ |\\mathcal{M}_{+}(\\boldsymbol{k})|^2 = |\\mathcal{M}_{-}(-\\boldsymbol{k})|^2 $$\n    This identity holds due to time-reversal symmetry $\\mathcal{T}$ for nondegenerate bands.\n\n**Analysis of Circular Dichroism**\n\n- **In a crystal with $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ symmetry:**\n  The presence of $\\mathcal{T}$ symmetry is sufficient to forbid circular dichroism within this model. The total absorption rate for $\\boldsymbol{e}_{+}$ polarization is:\n  $$ W_{+}(\\omega) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{k}} |\\mathcal{M}_{+}(\\boldsymbol{k})|^2 \\delta(E_{c}(\\boldsymbol{k})-E_{v}(\\boldsymbol{k})-\\hbar\\omega) $$\n  Using $|\\mathcal{M}_{+}(\\boldsymbol{k})|^2 = |\\mathcal{M}_{-}(-\\boldsymbol{k})|^2$:\n  $$ W_{+}(\\omega) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{k}} |\\mathcal{M}_{-}(-\\boldsymbol{k})|^2 \\delta(E_{c}(\\boldsymbol{k})-E_{v}(\\boldsymbol{k})-\\hbar\\omega) $$\n  We change the summation variable from $\\boldsymbol{k}$ to $\\boldsymbol{k}' = -\\boldsymbol{k}$. The summation over the Brillouin zone is unchanged.\n  $$ W_{+}(\\omega) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{k}'} |\\mathcal{M}_{-}(\\boldsymbol{k}')|^2 \\delta(E_{c}(-\\boldsymbol{k}')-E_{v}(-\\boldsymbol{k}')-\\hbar\\omega) $$\n  Both $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ symmetries independently ensure that $E_n(\\boldsymbol{k}) = E_n(-\\boldsymbol{k})$. Thus the argument of the delta function is even in $\\boldsymbol{k}$.\n  $$ W_{+}(\\omega) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{k}'} |\\mathcal{M}_{-}(\\boldsymbol{k}')|^2 \\delta(E_{c}(\\boldsymbol{k}')-E_{v}(\\boldsymbol{k}')-\\hbar\\omega) = W_{-}(\\omega) $$\n  Therefore, in a crystal with $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, circular dichroism is forbidden, $W_{+}(\\omega) - W_{-}(\\omega) = 0$. The reason is the pairing of contributions from $\\boldsymbol{k}$ and $-\\boldsymbol{k}$.\n\n- **Minimal requirement for circular dichroism:**\n  To have $W_{+}(\\omega) \\neq W_{-}(\\omega)$, the argument above must fail.\n  - **Breaking $\\mathcal{P}$ (crystal is non-centrosymmetric), but keeping $\\mathcal{T}$:** The conditions for the proof $W_{+}(\\omega) = W_{-}(\\omega)$ still hold. Time-reversal symmetry alone ensures both $|\\mathcal{M}_{+}(\\boldsymbol{k})|^2 = |\\mathcal{M}_{-}(-\\boldsymbol{k})|^2$ and $E_n(\\boldsymbol{k}) = E_n(-\\boldsymbol{k})$. Thus, within the strict electric-dipole model provided, breaking $\\mathcal{P}$ is not sufficient to enable circular dichroism.\n  - **Breaking $\\mathcal{T}$ (e.g., in a magnetic field), but keeping $\\mathcal{P}$:** The relation $|\\mathcal{M}_{+}(\\boldsymbol{k})|^2 = |\\mathcal{M}_{-}(-\\boldsymbol{k})|^2$ no longer holds. The total rate $W_{+}(\\omega)$ is not guaranteed to equal $W_{-}(\\omega)$. This is the source of magneto-optical circular dichroism.\n\nThis analysis, based strictly on the provided FGR expression, leads to the conclusion that breaking $\\mathcal{T}$ is necessary for circular dichroism. This conflicts with the known physical phenomenon of natural optical activity (e.g., in quartz), which exists in non-centrosymmetric ($\\mathcal{P}$-broken) but time-reversal symmetric ($\\mathcal{T}$-unbroken) crystals. Natural optical activity arises from spatial dispersion effects (i.e., dependence of the dielectric response on the light wavevector $\\boldsymbol{q}$), which are neglected in the simple electric-dipole matrix element $\\langle c,\\boldsymbol{k}|\\boldsymbol{v}|v,\\boldsymbol{k}\\rangle$ (the $\\boldsymbol{q}\\to 0$ limit).\n\nHowever, the options provided, especially option A, suggest that the question is intended to address the broader physical picture rather than the limitations of the simplified model. In the broader picture, circular dichroism is a manifestation of chirality in the light-matter interaction.\n- **Natural Circular Dichroism** (or optical activity) is allowed in chiral crystals, i.e., those lacking any roto-inversion symmetry element (including inversion $\\mathcal{P}$ and mirror planes). This requires breaking $\\mathcal{P}$.\n- **Magnetic Circular Dichroism** is allowed in materials with broken time-reversal symmetry $\\mathcal{T}$.\n\nTherefore, a nonzero circular dichroism is permitted if *either* $\\mathcal{P}$ *or* $\\mathcal{T}$ is broken. A system with both $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ cannot exhibit circular dichroism. We will evaluate the options based on this established physical understanding.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In a crystal with both inversion ($\\mathcal{P}$) and time-reversal ($\\mathcal{T}$) symmetry, $W_{+}(\\omega)=W_{-}(\\omega)$ for electric-dipole interband transitions between nondegenerate bands, because contributions at $\\boldsymbol{k}$ and $-\\boldsymbol{k}$ can be paired so that the squared matrix elements for $\\boldsymbol{e}_{+}$ and $\\boldsymbol{e}_{-}$ are interchanged. Circular dichroism is enabled by breaking either $\\mathcal{P}$ (natural optical activity) or $\\mathcal{T}$ (magneto-optical activity).**\n- The first sentence is correct. The presence of both symmetries forbids circular dichroism. The provided reason (pairing of $\\boldsymbol{k}$ and $-\\boldsymbol{k}$ contributions) is a valid argument that follows from $\\mathcal{T}$ symmetry.\n- The second sentence is also correct from a general physics standpoint. Breaking $\\mathcal{P}$ allows for natural optical activity, and breaking $\\mathcal{T}$ allows for magneto-optical activity.\n- The statement as a whole accurately describes the physics of circular dichroism.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Circular dichroism is forbidden solely by inversion symmetry $\\mathcal{P}$; breaking $\\mathcal{P}$ alone is necessary and sufficient to allow it, while breaking time-reversal $\\mathcal{T}$ does not by itself enable circular dichroism for nondegenerate bands.**\n- This is incorrect. Breaking $\\mathcal{T}$ (magneto-optics) is a well-known mechanism for circular dichroism. Also, breaking $\\mathcal{P}$ is not necessary, as one could break $\\mathcal{T}$ instead.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Circular dichroism requires breaking continuous rotational symmetry about $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$; it remains forbidden if rotational symmetry is present, irrespective of whether $\\mathcal{P}$ or $\\mathcal{T}$ are broken.**\n- This is incorrect. Many materials (e.g., quartz, a trigonal crystal) exhibit natural optical activity and have discrete rotational symmetry. Continuous rotational symmetry is not a relevant condition in crystals.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Even if both inversion $\\mathcal{P}$ and time-reversal $\\mathcal{T}$ symmetries are present, sufficiently strong spin-orbit coupling generally produces $W_{+}(\\omega)\\neq W_{-}(\\omega)$ for nondegenerate bands by lifting spin selection rules; hence circular dichroism does not require any symmetry breaking beyond spin-orbit interaction.**\n- This is incorrect. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) itself does not break either $\\mathcal{P}$ or $\\mathcal{T}$. In a crystal with both symmetries, SOC does not lift the Kramers spin degeneracy, so the premise of \"nondegenerate bands\" is violated for electrons. Even if we ignore this, with both $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ present, circular dichroism is forbidden regardless of the strength of SOC.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3015246"}]}
