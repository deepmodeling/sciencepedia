The problem is scientifically sound and well-posed. We proceed with the derivation in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Pauli Paramagnetic Susceptibility ($\\chi_P$)\n\nThe Pauli paramagnetism arises from the alignment of electron spins with an external magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The energy of an electron with wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ and spin quantum number $s_z = \\pm\\frac{1}{2}$ is given by\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}, s_z) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} - 2 s_z \\mu_B B$$\nwhere $m$ is the band mass and $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m}$ is the Bohr magneton. Spin-up electrons ($\\uparrow$, $s_z=+\\frac{1}{2}$) have their energy lowered by $\\mu_B B$, while spin-down electrons ($\\downarrow$, $s_z=-\\frac{1}{2}$) have their energy raised by $\\mu_B B$.\n\nAt $T=0$, electrons occupy all available states up to the chemical potential $\\mu$. In the presence of the magnetic field, the densities of spin-up ($n_\\uparrow$) and spin-down ($n_\\downarrow$) electrons are determined by filling states up to $\\mu$. Let $g_0(E)$ be the total density of states (DOS) for both spins per unit volume in the absence of a magnetic field. The DOS for a single spin species is $\\frac{1}{2}g_0(E)$.\nThe number densities are:\n$$n_\\uparrow = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}g_0(E) f(E-\\mu_B B - \\mu) dE = \\int_{\\mu_B B}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}g_0(E'+\\mu_B B) f(E' - \\mu) dE'$$\n$$n_\\downarrow = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}g_0(E) f(E+\\mu_B B - \\mu) dE = \\int_{-\\mu_B B}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}g_0(E'-\\mu_B B) f(E' - \\mu) dE'$$\nAt $T=0$, the Fermi-Dirac distribution $f(x)$ is a step function. More simply, we can see that the up-spin band is filled to energy $\\mu+\\mu_B B$ and the down-spin band is filled to $\\mu-\\mu_B B$ in their respective energy scales. In a common energy scale, this means all up-spin states are filled to an energy $\\mu$, and their kinetic energies go up to $\\mu+\\mu_B B$. All down-spin states are filled up to $\\mu$, with kinetic energy up to $\\mu-\\mu_B B$.\nThe number densities are given by:\n$$n_\\uparrow = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{\\mu+\\mu_B B} g_s(E_{kin}) dE_{kin}$$\n$$n_\\downarrow = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{\\mu-\\mu_B B} g_s(E_{kin}) dE_{kin}$$\nwhere $g_s(E_{kin})$ is the DOS (for both spins) as a function of kinetic energy. The problem defines $g(E_F)$ as the total DOS at the Fermi energy $E_F$. So we use $g(E)$ for the total DOS.\nThe number densities for each spin species are:\n$$n_\\uparrow = \\int_0^\\mu \\frac{1}{2}g(E+\\mu_B B) dE \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n_\\downarrow = \\int_0^\\mu \\frac{1}{2}g(E-\\mu_B B) dE$$\nA simpler, equivalent approach for weak fields ($\\mu_B B \\ll \\mu \\approx E_F$) is to expand the integrals. At $T=0$, the number of electrons of a given spin is the integral of the single-spin DOS up to the chemical potential $\\mu$. For spin-up electrons, the effective DOS is shifted down in energy, $g_\\uparrow(E) = \\frac{1}{2} g_0(E+\\mu_B B)$.\n$$n_\\uparrow = \\int_0^\\mu \\frac{1}{2} g_0(E+\\mu_B B)dE$$\nFor a weak field, we fix the total number of electrons, $n = n_\\uparrow + n_\\downarrow$, which keeps the chemical potential $\\mu \\approx E_F$ to first order in $B$.\n$$n_\\uparrow \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{E_F} g_0(E)dE + \\frac{1}{2} g_0(E_F) \\mu_B B = \\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}g(E_F)\\mu_B B$$\n$$n_\\downarrow \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{E_F} g_0(E)dE - \\frac{1}{2} g_0(E_F) \\mu_B B = \\frac{n}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}g(E_F)\\mu_B B$$\nThe net magnetization density $M_P$ is the magnetic moment per unit volume. Each spin-up electron contributes $+\\mu_B$ and each spin-down electron contributes $-\\mu_B$.\n$$M_P = \\mu_B(n_\\uparrow - n_\\downarrow) = \\mu_B \\left[ \\left(\\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}g(E_F)\\mu_B B\\right) - \\left(\\frac{n}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}g(E_F)\\mu_B B\\right) \\right]$$\n$$M_P = \\mu_B^2 g(E_F) B$$\nThe magnetic susceptibility is defined as $\\chi_P \\simeq \\mu_0 \\frac{\\partial M_P}{\\partial B}$ for a weak response.\n$$\\chi_P = \\mu_0 \\mu_B^2 g(E_F)$$\n\n### Part 2: Landau Diamagnetic Susceptibility ($\\chi_L$)\n\nLandau diamagnetism arises from the quantization of electron orbital motion in a magnetic field. The electron energies form Landau levels:\n$$E_\\nu(k_z) = \\left(\\nu+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega_c + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_z^2}{2m}$$\nwhere $\\nu=0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the Landau level index and $\\omega_c = \\frac{eB}{m}$ is the cyclotron frequency. For this part, we ignore the Zeeman splitting as per the instructions.\n\nThe grand potential density $\\omega(B) = \\Omega(B)/V$ at $T=0$ is given by $\\omega = \\int_0^\\mu (E-\\mu) g(E; B) dE$, where $g(E; B)$ is the total DOS (including spin) in the presence of the field $B$. The DOS is found by summing over all Landau levels and integrating over $k_z$:\n$$g(E; B) = \\frac{(2m)^{1/2}m\\omega_c}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi^2\\hbar^2} \\sum_{\\nu=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E - \\left(\\nu+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega_c}}$$\nwhere the sum includes only terms for which the argument of the square root is positive.\nSubstituting into the expression for $\\omega(B)$:\n$$\\omega(B) = \\frac{m^{3/2}\\omega_c}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi^2\\hbar^2} \\sum_{\\nu=0}^\\infty \\int_{(\\nu+1/2)\\hbar\\omega_c}^\\mu (E-\\mu) \\frac{dE}{\\sqrt{E - \\left(\\nu+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega_c}}$$\nThe integral evaluates to $-\\frac{4}{3} \\left(\\mu - \\left(\\nu+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega_c\\right)^{3/2}$. Let $h = \\hbar\\omega_c$.\n$$\\omega(B) = -\\frac{2\\sqrt{2} m^{3/2} h}{3\\pi^2\\hbar^3} \\sum_{\\nu=0}^\\infty \\left(\\mu - \\left(\\nu+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)h\\right)^{3/2}$$\nFor a weak field, $h \\ll \\mu$, we expand the sum using the Euler-Maclaurin formula: $\\sum_{k=a}^b f(k) \\approx \\int_a^b f(x)dx + \\frac{f(a)+f(b)}{2} + \\frac{1}{12}(f'(b)-f'(a)) - \\dots$.\nLet $f(\\nu) = (\\mu - (\\nu+1/2)h)^{3/2}$. We sum from $\\nu=0$ to $N \\approx \\mu/h - 1/2$. Ignoring oscillatory terms arising from the upper limit, we get:\n$$S = \\sum_{\\nu=0}^N f(\\nu) \\approx \\int_0^N f(\\nu)d\\nu + \\frac{f(0)}{2} - \\frac{1}{12}f'(0)$$\nThe terms are:\n$$\\int_0^N f(\\nu)d\\nu \\approx \\frac{2}{5h}\\left(\\mu-\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^{5/2} \\approx \\frac{2\\mu^{5/2}}{5h} - \\frac{\\mu^{3/2}}{2} + \\frac{3h\\mu^{1/2}}{16}$$\n$$\\frac{f(0)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mu-\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^{3/2} \\approx \\frac{\\mu^{3/2}}{2} - \\frac{3h\\mu^{1/2}}{8}$$\n$$-\\frac{f'(0)}{12} = -\\frac{1}{12}\\left(-\\frac{3h}{2}\\right)\\left(\\mu-\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^{1/2} \\approx \\frac{h}{8}\\mu^{1/2}$$\nSumming these expansions gives:\n$$S \\approx \\left(\\frac{2\\mu^{5/2}}{5h} - \\frac{\\mu^{3/2}}{2}\\right) + \\frac{\\mu^{3/2}}{2} + h\\mu^{1/2}\\left(\\frac{3}{16} - \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\\right) = \\frac{2\\mu^{5/2}}{5h} - \\frac{h\\mu^{1/2}}{16}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\omega(B)$:\n$$\\omega(B) \\approx -\\frac{2\\sqrt{2} m^{3/2} h}{3\\pi^2\\hbar^3} \\left(\\frac{2\\mu^{5/2}}{5h} - \\frac{h\\mu^{1/2}}{16}\\right) = -\\frac{4\\sqrt{2} m^{3/2}}{15\\pi^2\\hbar^3}\\mu^{5/2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}m^{3/2}h^2\\mu^{1/2}}{24\\pi^2\\hbar^3}$$\nThe first term is the zero-field grand potential density, $\\omega_0$. The change due to the magnetic field is:\n$$\\Delta\\omega = \\omega(B) - \\omega_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}m^{3/2}(\\hbar\\omega_c)^2}{24\\pi^2\\hbar^3}\\mu^{1/2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}m^{3/2}}{24\\pi^2\\hbar^3} \\left(\\frac{\\hbar eB}{m}\\right)^2 \\mu^{1/2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}m^{-1/2} e^2 B^2}{24\\pi^2\\hbar}\\mu^{1/2}$$\nThe orbital magnetization is $M_L = -\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta\\omega)}{\\partial B}|_\\mu$:\n$$M_L = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}m^{-1/2} e^2 B}{12\\pi^2\\hbar}\\mu^{1/2}$$\nThe diamagnetism is confirmed by the negative sign. The susceptibility $\\chi_L \\simeq \\mu_0 \\frac{\\partial M_L}{\\partial B}$ is:\n$$\\chi_L = - \\mu_0 \\frac{\\sqrt{2}m^{-1/2} e^2}{12\\pi^2\\hbar}\\mu^{1/2}$$\n\n### Part 3: Ratio $\\chi_L/\\chi_P$ and Scaling with Density $n$\n\nWe now express both susceptibilities in terms of common parameters.

Starting from the Landau quantization of orbital motion and the definition of the grand potential, derive the leading-order-in-$B$ orbital magnetization per unit volume $M(B)$ of the electron gas and express it in terms of fundamental constants and the density of states at the Fermi energy. Then, using this expression, obtain an order-of-magnitude estimate of $M$ for a free-electron-like monovalent metal with conduction electron number density $n=8.5\\times 10^{28}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$ and Fermi energy $\\varepsilon_{F}=7.0\\,\\text{eV}$.
