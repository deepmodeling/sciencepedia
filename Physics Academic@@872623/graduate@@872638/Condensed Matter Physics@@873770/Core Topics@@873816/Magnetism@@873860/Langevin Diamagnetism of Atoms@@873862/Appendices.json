We must first verify that the given microscopic expression for $\\alpha_{m}$ is dimensionally consistent with its definition as the ratio of induced magnetic moment to the applied magnetic flux density. Then, we are to determine the exponents $a$, $b$, c, and $d$ when the dimension of $\\alpha_{m}$ is expressed in terms of the base SI units: $\\mathrm{kg}^{a}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{b}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{c}\\,\\mathrm{A}^{d}$.\n\nLet us denote the dimension of a physical quantity $Q$ by $[Q]$. The base SI units are the kilogram ($\\mathrm{kg}$) for mass, the meter ($\\mathrm{m}$) for length, the second ($\\mathrm{s}$) for time, and the ampere ($\\mathrm{A}$) for electric current.\n\nThe problem provides two key relations for $\\alpha_m$:\n$1$. The definition relating the induced magnetic moment $\\mu_{\\text{ind}}$ to the magnetic flux density $B$: $\\mu_{\\text{ind}}=\\alpha_{m} B$.\n$2$. The microscopic expression for a single electron: $\\alpha_{m}=\\frac{e^{2}}{6 m}\\langle r^{2}\\rangle$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, $m$ is the electron mass, and $\\langle r^{2}\\rangle$ is the mean-square orbital radius.\n\nFirst, we will perform the verification. This requires showing that the dimensions derived from relation ($1$) are identical to those derived from relation ($2$).\n\nFrom the definition $\\mu_{\\text{ind}} = \\alpha_m B$, we can write the dimension of $\\alpha_m$ as:\n$$[\\alpha_m] = \\frac{[\\mu_{\\text{ind}}]}{[B]}$$\nThis explicitly shows that the units of $\\alpha_m$ are those of magnetic moment per magnetic field, as required by the first part of the problem. To make this verification rigorous using first principles, we will express $[\\alpha_m]$ from both relations in terms of base SI units and show they are equivalent.\n\nLet's find the base units for magnetic moment, $[\\mu_{\\text{ind}}]$, and magnetic flux density, $[B]$.\nThe magnetic flux density $B$ can be defined through the Lorentz force law, $\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$. The magnetic part is $|\\mathbf{F}| = |q| |\\mathbf{v}| |\\mathbf{B}|$ for perpendicular velocity and field.\nThe dimension of force $[F]$ is $\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-2}$.\nThe dimension of charge $[q]$ is the coulomb ($\\mathrm{C}$), which is $\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$.\nThe dimension of velocity $[v]$ is $\\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nTherefore, the dimension of magnetic flux density is:\n$$[B] = \\frac{[F]}{[q][v]} = \\frac{\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-2}}{(\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1})} = \\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-2} \\cdot \\mathrm{A}^{-1}$$\nThe unit for $B$ is the tesla ($\\mathrm{T}$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{T} = 1\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-2} \\cdot \\mathrm{A}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we find the dimension of magnetic moment, $[\\mu_{\\text{ind}}]$. A magnetic moment can be classically pictured as a current loop, where $\\mu = I A$.\nThe dimension of current $[I]$ is $\\mathrm{A}$.\nThe dimension of area $[A]$ is $\\mathrm{m}^2$.\nThus, the dimension of magnetic moment is:\n$$[\\mu_{\\text{ind}}] = [I][A] = \\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2$$\nAlternatively, from the potential energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field, $U = -\\mathbf{\\mu} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$, we get $[\\mu] = [U]/[B]$.

All physical and mathematical premises are sound.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages: first, defining the necessary mathematical functions based on quantum theory; second, specifying the numerical and analytical methods for calculating $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$; and third, outlining the process for computing the relative error for each test case.\n\n**1. Hydrogenic Radial Wavefunction, $R_{n\\ell}(r)$**\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for a hydrogen-like atom with nuclear charge $Z$ yields solutions separable in spherical coordinates. The radial part of the wavefunction, denoted $R_{n\\ell}(r)$, is dependent on the principal quantum number $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$ and the orbital angular momentum quantum number $\\ell \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.

The components of this expression are:\n- The normalization constant, $N_{n\\ell}$, which ensures $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} |R_{n\\ell}(r)|^2 r^2 dr = 1$:\n$$\nN_{n\\ell} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{2Z}{na_0}\\right)^3 \\frac{(n-\\ell-1)!}{2n \\cdot (n+\\ell)!}}\n$$\n- The exponential term $\\exp(-Zr/(na_0))$, which guarantees the wavefunction decays at large distances.\n- The term $(2Zr/(na_0))^\\ell$, which governs the behavior near the origin $r=0$.\n- The function $L_{p}^{k}(x)$, which is the generalized (or associated) Laguerre polynomial. Here, the polynomial's degree is $p = n-\\ell-1$ and its order is $k = 2\\ell+1$.

This makes the improper integral suitable for high-precision numerical quadrature, for which we will employ the `scipy.integrate.quad` function. To ensure high accuracy, the relative and absolute error tolerances for the quadrature will be set to a stringent value, such as $10^{-14}$.\n\n**b. Analytical Calculation**\nThe expectation value $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$ for hydrogenic states has a known closed-form analytical solution, which can be derived using properties of Laguerre polynomials or operator methods. The formula is:\n\n$$\n\\langle r^2 \\rangle_{\\text{an}} = \\frac{a_0^2 n^2}{2Z^2} [5n^2 + 1 - 3\\ell(\\ell+1)]\n$$\n\nBy implementing this formula directly, we obtain a benchmark value against which our numerical integration can be validated.

It will use `scipy.special.factorial` for the normalization constant and `scipy.special.genlaguerre` to evaluate the associated Laguerre polynomial $L_{n-\\ell-1}^{2\\ell+1}$.\n- A function `calculate_r2_numerical` will define the integrand $r^4 |R_{n\\ell}(r)|^2$ and pass it to `scipy.integrate.quad` with the integration limits $[0, \\infty)$.\n- A function `calculate_r2_analytical` will compute the value from the closed-form expression.\n- The main `solve` routine will iterate through the provided test cases: $(1,1,0)$, $(1,2,0)$, $(1,2,1)$, $(2,1,0)$, $(3,3,2)$, and $(2,5,0)$.
