## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the theoretical foundations of the strong CP problem and its resolution via the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism, we now turn our attention to the rich and varied implications of this framework across diverse fields of physics. The introduction of the [axion](@entry_id:156508) is not merely a theoretical maneuver to adjust a parameter to zero; it postulates a new particle with a specific set of interactions that give rise to a wealth of observable phenomena. This chapter will explore these consequences, demonstrating how the physics of the QCD [axion](@entry_id:156508) provides a powerful bridge connecting particle theory with precision measurements, astrophysics, cosmology, and the study of matter under extreme conditions. The search for the [axion](@entry_id:156508) and its associated effects has become a major interdisciplinary driver of both theoretical and experimental research, addressing some of the most profound puzzles in modern science.

### Probes of CP Violation: Electric Dipole Moments

The very existence of the strong CP problem is predicated on the experimental non-observation of a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) for the neutron. The QCD $\bar{\theta}$ term violates CP symmetry and would induce a neutron EDM, $d_n$, with a magnitude far larger than current experimental limits permit. Turning this logic around, the relentless experimental search for EDMs becomes one of the most powerful probes for new sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model. The principles underlying the [axion](@entry_id:156508) mechanism are deeply connected to this ongoing quest.

A crucial insight, which mirrors the physics of the neutron EDM, comes from the search for the electron EDM ($d_e$). Leading experiments do not use free electrons but rather [heavy polar molecules](@entry_id:164943). Within such a molecule, the electron is subjected to an immense internal effective electric field, orders of magnitude greater than any achievable laboratory field. This molecular amplification makes the experiment exquisitely sensitive to a non-zero $d_e$. An analogous principle applies to the neutron. Although charge-neutral overall, the neutron is a composite state of charged quarks. These constituent quarks generate extremely strong internal electric and chromo-electric fields on the QCD scale. A fundamental EDM or chromo-EDM of a quark would interact with these powerful internal fields, contributing to the total energy of the neutron. By manipulating the neutron's spin orientation with external fields, experimentalists can search for a tiny energy shift that would signal this internal CP-violating interaction. Thus, the neutral neutron acts as a powerful amplifier for the EDMs of its constituent quarks, in direct parallel to the role of [polar molecules](@entry_id:144673) in electron EDM searches [@problem_id:2019463].

The diagnostic power of EDM searches is further enhanced by comparing the EDMs of different particles. Various models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict specific patterns for the underlying sources of CP violation, such as the relative sizes of the up-quark and down-quark EDMs or chromo-EDMs. These fundamental parameters translate, via non-perturbative QCD calculations, into specific predictions for the ratio of the proton EDM to the neutron EDM ($d_p/d_n$). A precise measurement of both $d_p$ and $d_n$ would therefore provide a critical test, allowing physicists to distinguish between different classes of new physics theories. For example, by using [isospin symmetry](@entry_id:146063) to relate the quark content of the proton and neutron, a definite prediction for the ratio $d_p/d_n$ can be derived for any given model of quark-level CP violation, providing a sharp experimental target [@problem_id:415869].

### The Axion as a Cosmological Player

If the axion exists, it would have been produced in the early universe and its cosmological evolution would leave a number of potentially observable imprints. The axion's cosmological role is multifaceted, offering solutions to outstanding puzzles while also imposing strong constraints on its properties.

#### Axion Dark Matter and Topological Defects

One of the most compelling features of the axion is its viability as a candidate for cold dark matter. Through a process known as the misalignment mechanism, a coherent field of axions can be produced non-thermally in the early universe, naturally yielding a [relic abundance](@entry_id:161012) in the correct range to constitute the observed dark matter.

The cosmological history of the $U(1)_{PQ}$ [symmetry breaking](@entry_id:143062) is also tied to the formation of [topological defects](@entry_id:138787). If this symmetry breaking occurred after the [inflationary epoch](@entry_id:161642), the universe would have formed a network of axionic strings and [domain walls](@entry_id:144723). The existence of these defects has profound consequences. The axion potential is periodic, leading to multiple degenerate vacuum states. The number of these states, known as the domain wall number $N_{DW}$, is determined by the anomaly structure of the specific axion model. For instance, in KSVZ-type models, $N_{DW}$ can be calculated from the PQ charges and color representations of the new [heavy fermions](@entry_id:145749) introduced. If $N_{DW} > 1$, stable domain walls would form and their energy density would come to dominate the universe, in stark contradiction with cosmological observations. This "domain wall problem" provides a powerful constraint, strongly favoring models with $N_{DW} = 1$ [@problem_id:434274].

While [domain walls](@entry_id:144723) can be problematic, the associated axionic strings offer a rich phenomenology. These one-dimensional topological defects generate a long-range axion field configuration, analogous to the [magnetic vector potential](@entry_id:141246) around a magnetic flux tube. Consequently, a PQ-charged fermion scattering off an [axion](@entry_id:156508) string would experience a [quantum interference](@entry_id:139127) effect identical in form to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, with a scattering cross-section that depends on the string's topological [winding number](@entry_id:138707) and the fermion's PQ charge [@problem_id:215920]. Furthermore, the worldsheet of a KSVZ-type [axion](@entry_id:156508) string hosts trapped massless fermion modes. In the presence of an external electric field parallel to the string, the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) in the (1+1)-dimensional worldsheet theory leads to anomalous particle production, generating a steady-state anomalous [electric current](@entry_id:261145) along the string. The detection of such a current would be a striking signature of an an axionic string passing through our galaxy [@problem_id:434325].

#### Axiogenesis: A Unified Origin for Matter

Remarkably, the [axion](@entry_id:156508) may not only solve the strong CP problem but also explain the origin of the [baryon asymmetry of the universe](@entry_id:162153). In a scenario known as axiogenesis, the dynamics of the axion field in the early universe provides the necessary ingredients for [baryogenesis](@entry_id:160277). Through its anomalous coupling to the electroweak [gauge bosons](@entry_id:200257), a time-varying [axion](@entry_id:156508) field, $\dot{a}(t)$, acts as an effective chemical potential for baryon-plus-lepton number (B+L). This is because the divergence of the B+L current in the Standard Model is proportional to the same topological term, $W_{\mu\nu}^i \tilde{W}^{i\mu\nu}$, to which the axion couples. A rolling [axion](@entry_id:156508) field therefore biases the non-perturbative [electroweak sphaleron](@entry_id:160266) transitions, which violate B+L, to produce an excess of fermions over anti-fermions, generating the observed [matter-antimatter asymmetry](@entry_id:151107) [@problem_id:215945].

#### Novel Astrophysical Detection Signatures

The coupling of axions to photons, $g_{a\gamma\gamma} a F_{\mu\nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}$, which is generic in axion models, is the primary channel for most [direct detection](@entry_id:748463) experiments (haloscopes). This coupling also opens up more exotic detection possibilities that connect [axion](@entry_id:156508) physics to other frontiers, such as [gravitational wave astronomy](@entry_id:144334). Consider a region with a strong background magnetic field, permeated by a passing gravitational wave. The [metric perturbation](@entry_id:157898) from the gravitational wave can modulate the effective axion-photon coupling. If the gravitational wave frequency is tuned correctly, it can trigger a [parametric resonance](@entry_id:139376), leading to an exponentially growing conversion of background axions (or virtual [axion](@entry_id:156508) fluctuations) into photons. The condition for this resonance depends on the axion mass and its coupling to photons. This phenomenon establishes a novel link between three distinct sectors—gravity, electromagnetism, and the axion—and suggests that gravitational wave detectors or dedicated radio telescopes could potentially be used to search for axions [@problem_id:215926].

### Axion Properties in Extreme Environments

The [axion](@entry_id:156508)'s potential, and therefore its mass, arises from non-perturbative QCD effects. As such, its properties are expected to change in environments where the structure of the QCD vacuum is altered, such as in the core of neutron stars or in the primordial universe under extreme conditions.

At very high isospin chemical potential ($\mu_I$), but moderate baryon density, QCD is expected to enter a pion-condensed phase. In this state, the [chiral condensate](@entry_id:148723), which is responsible for the axion's mass in vacuum, is replaced by a condensate of pions. The [axion](@entry_id:156508) potential is still generated, but through a different mechanism involving the pion condensate. As a result, the [axion](@entry_id:156508) mass in this phase is no longer constant but becomes a function of the environment, depending on the ratio of the vacuum pion mass to the [isospin](@entry_id:156514) chemical potential [@problem_id:215915].

At asymptotically high baryon chemical potential, QCD is predicted to enter the Color-Flavor-Locked (CFL) superconducting phase. The physics in this regime is even more exotic. Here, the [axion](@entry_id:156508) mixes with another pseudo-Goldstone boson, the CFL $\eta'$, which arises from the spontaneous breaking of axial [baryon number](@entry_id:157941). The QCD anomaly generates a potential for a specific [linear combination](@entry_id:155091) of the axion and the $\eta'$ field. This mixing results in two physical eigenstates: one remains massless, while the other acquires a mass that depends on the parameters of the CFL phase, such as the quark chemical potential $\mu$ and the superconducting gap $\Delta$. The study of [axion](@entry_id:156508) properties in such extreme phases of matter therefore provides a unique theoretical laboratory for understanding the interplay between chiral and topological properties of QCD [@problem_id:215958].

### Model Building and Connections to Other Hierarchies

The success of the Peccei-Quinn mechanism hinges on the $U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry being an extremely good approximate symmetry of nature, broken only by the QCD anomaly. This leads to the "axion quality problem": why should other physics, especially quantum gravity which is believed to break all global symmetries, respect the PQ symmetry to such a high degree?

This challenge has stimulated deep connections between [axion](@entry_id:156508) physics, Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), and theories of quantum gravity. One can parameterize the unwanted gravitational effects by Planck-suppressed operators that explicitly break $U(1)_{PQ}$. Such terms in the potential would shift the minimum away from the CP-conserving point, reintroducing a non-zero $\bar{\theta}$. The stringent experimental limit on the neutron EDM then translates into a severe constraint on the coefficients of these operators [@problem_id:201354]. A compelling solution to the quality problem is to arrange for the global $U(1)_{PQ}$ to be an "accidental" symmetry, protected by a fundamental discrete *gauge* symmetry, which is respected by gravity. In some GUT models, such as those based on $SO(10)$, the breaking of a [gauge group](@entry_id:144761) at high energies can leave behind a remnant discrete [gauge symmetry](@entry_id:136438) (e.g., $\mathbb{Z}_N$). If the fields involved in the PQ mechanism carry appropriate charges under this [discrete symmetry](@entry_id:146994), the lowest-dimension Planck-scale operators that would spoil the solution are forbidden. The PQ symmetry is thus naturally protected [@problem_id:326001].

Perhaps the most ambitious extension of the axion paradigm is the relaxion model, which co-opts the [axion](@entry_id:156508) mechanism to solve the electroweak [hierarchy problem](@entry_id:148573). In this framework, an [axion](@entry_id:156508)-like field, the relaxion, rolls down a potential during cosmic inflation. The relaxion field value dynamically sets the mass-squared parameter of the Higgs boson. As the relaxion rolls, the Higgs mass-squared is driven from a large positive value towards zero. Once it becomes negative, [electroweak symmetry](@entry_id:149377) is broken and the Higgs acquires a [vacuum expectation value](@entry_id:146340) ($v$). This, in turn, activates a [backreaction](@entry_id:203910) potential for the relaxion via its axion-like coupling to QCD. This potential creates periodic barriers that grow with $v$, eventually becoming steep enough to halt the relaxion's classical motion. The electroweak scale is thereby dynamically stabilized at the value where the relaxion stops rolling. This remarkable idea links the electroweak scale to the QCD scale and requires a very long period of inflation for the relaxion to scan the requisite field range. It represents a profound synthesis of axion physics, cosmology, and the [hierarchy problem](@entry_id:148573), demonstrating the extraordinary versatility of the core concepts developed to solve the strong CP problem [@problem_id:215959].

In summary, the theoretical framework constructed to address the strong CP puzzle has blossomed into a far-reaching research program. The [axion](@entry_id:156508), its central player, stands at the nexus of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, offering potential answers to the nature of dark matter and the origin of matter, while serving as a unique probe of [fundamental symmetries](@entry_id:161256) and the behavior of matter in the universe's most extreme environments.
