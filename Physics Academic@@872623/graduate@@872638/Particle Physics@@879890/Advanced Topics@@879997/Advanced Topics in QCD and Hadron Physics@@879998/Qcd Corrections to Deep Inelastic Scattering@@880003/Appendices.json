At high momentum transfers, the observed particle is viewed as a composite object whose constituents are other partons (quarks, gluons, or in QED, electrons and photons). The evolution of these parton distribution functions with the energy scale is described by the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) equations.\n\nThe key ingredients in the DGLAP equations are the splitting functions, $P_{ba}(z)$, which describe the probability of a parton of type $a$ splitting into a parton of type $b$ carrying a fraction $z$ of the parent parton's longitudinal momentum.\n\nIn this problem, we will calculate the unregularized QED splitting function $P_{ee}(z)$, which governs the process $e(k) \\to e(p')\\gamma(q)$, i.e., an electron radiating a photon.
