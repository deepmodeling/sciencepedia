At a very high energy scale, the unification scale $M_X$, the individual gauge couplings of the SM are presumed to emerge from a single, unified gauge coupling $g_{GUT}$.\n\nThis unification imposes constraints on the values of the SM couplings at $M_X$. The relationships depend on how the SM gauge generators are embedded within the Lie algebra of $SU(5)$. Let the generators of a simple Lie group be denoted by $T^a$, normalized in the fundamental representation such that $\\text{Tr}(T^a T^b) = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta^{ab}$.

The hypercharge generator $Y/2$ is not properly normalized, as $\\text{Tr}((Y/2)^2) = 5/6 \\neq 1/2$. To find the relation between the SM coupling $g_Y$ and $g_{GUT}$, we must relate their corresponding generators. Let the correctly normalized GUT generator for hypercharge be $T'_Y$. The interaction terms must match: $g_Y (Y/2) = g_{GUT} T'_Y$. We require $\\text{Tr}((T'_Y)^2)=1/2$. This means $T'_Y = c(Y/2)$ where $c$ is a normalization constant.\n\n5.
