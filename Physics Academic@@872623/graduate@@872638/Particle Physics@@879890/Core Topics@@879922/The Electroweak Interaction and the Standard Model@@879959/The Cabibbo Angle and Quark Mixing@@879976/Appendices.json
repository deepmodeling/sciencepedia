The CKM matrix is given by $V_{CKM} = V_u^\\dagger V_d$, where $V_u$ and $V_d$ are the unitary matrices that diagonalize the hermitian quark mass matrices:\n$$V_u^\\dagger M_u V_u = \\text{diag}(m_u, m_c, m_t)$$\n$$V_d^\\dagger M_d V_d = \\text{diag}(m_d, m_s, m_b)$$\nThe quark masses are ordered by magnitude, e.g., $m_d < m_s < m_b$. The columns of $V_d$ are the normalized eigenvectors of $M_d$, ordered according to the corresponding eigenvalues $(m_d, m_s, m_b)$. A similar rule applies to $V_u$.\n\nConsider a toy model for quark masses with the following specifications:\n1.

This mixing is described by the $3 \\times 3$ Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, $V_{CKM}$, which is unitary. A key consequence of this unitarity is that for any row or column, the sum of the squared magnitudes of its elements is equal to one. For the first row, this reads $|V_{ud}|^2 + |V_{us}|^2 + |V_{ub}|^2 = 1$.\n\nNow, consider a simple extension of the SM by introducing a single new vector-like up-type quark, denoted by $U$. This new particle is a color triplet, an $SU(2)_L$ singlet, and has an electric charge of $Q=+2/3$. The presence of this quark extends the up-type quark sector to four states $(u, c, t, U)$, while the down-type sector remains unchanged with three states $(d, s, b)$. Consequently, the CKM matrix becomes a $4 \\times 3$ matrix, and the $3 \\times 3$ submatrix corresponding to the SM quarks is no longer unitary.\n\nYour task is to calculate the deviation from unitarity for the first row of this effective $3 \\times 3$ CKM matrix.\n\nFor this problem, make the following simplifying assumptions:\n1.  Work in a basis where the down-type quarks are mass eigenstates, and the SM Yukawa couplings for the up-type quarks are diagonal. In this basis, the SM quark masses are $m_u, m_c, m_t$. Without the new quark, the CKM matrix in this basis would be the identity matrix.\n2.  The new vector-like quark $U$ has a vector-like mass $m_U$. It mixes with the SM quarks via interactions that, after electroweak symmetry breaking, generate off-diagonal mass terms.\n3.  The full $4 \\times 4$ up-type quark mass matrix, in the flavor basis $(u', c', t', U')$, takes the form:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{M}_u = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    m_u & 0 & 0 & \\lambda_u \\\\\n    0 & m_c & 0 & \\lambda_c \\\\\n    0 & 0 & m_t & \\lambda_t \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & m_U\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    where $\\lambda_u, \\lambda_c, \\lambda_t$ are complex-valued mixing mass parameters.
