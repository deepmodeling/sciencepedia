The process can be described by the reaction $e(k) + P(P) \\to e'(k') + X$, where $k, P, k'$ are the four-momenta of the initial electron, proton, and final electron, respectively, and $X$ represents the hadronic final state.\n\nThe key kinematic variables are:\n- The momentum transfer squared: $Q^2 = -q^2 = -(k-k')^2  0$.\n- The Bjorken scaling variable: $x = \\frac{Q^2}{2P \\cdot q}$.\n- The inelasticity parameter: $y = \\frac{P \\cdot q}{P \\cdot k}$.\n- The total lepton-proton center-of-mass energy squared: $s = (k+P)^2$.\n\nIn the high-energy limit, where all masses ($m_e, M_P, m_q$) can be neglected, these variables are related by $Q^2 \\approx sxy$.\n\nThe naive parton model interprets this process as the elastic scattering of the electron off a quasi-free, point-like constituent of the proton, a quark. The fundamental subprocess is $e(k) + q(p) \\to e(k') + q(p')$, where the initial quark carries a fraction $x$ of the proton's momentum, $p=xP$.\n\nConsider this partonic subprocess in the **parton-lepton center-of-mass frame**, which is the frame where the total three-momentum of the initial electron and the struck quark is zero. Let $\\hat{\\theta}_q$ be the scattering angle of the quark in this frame (i.e., the angle between the final three-momentum $\\vec{p}'$ and the initial three-momentum $\\vec{p}$).\n\nCalculate the cosine of the quark scattering angle, $\\cos(\\hat{\\theta}_q)$, as a function of the DIS kinematic variables $x$ and $y$.", "solution": "**Solution**\n\nWe are asked to find the cosine of the quark scattering angle, $\\cos(\\hat{\\theta}_q)$, in the parton-lepton center-of-mass (CM) frame for the subprocess $e(k) + q(p) \\to e(k') + q(p')$. We work in the high-energy limit where the masses of the electron, proton, and quark are negligible.\n\nThe calculation is most conveniently performed using Mandelstam variables for the partonic subprocess. Let's define them:\n- $\\hat{s} = (k+p)^2$\n- $\\hat{t} = (k-k')^2 = q^2 = -Q^2$\n- $\\hat{u} = (p-k')^2$\n\nSince we assume all particles are massless, the sum of the Mandelstam variables is zero:\n$$\n\\hat{s} + \\hat{t} + \\hat{u} = m_e^2 + m_q^2 + m_e^2 + m_q^2 \\approx 0\n$$\n\nFirst, we relate the partonic variable $\\hat{s}$ to the global DIS variables.

In this frame, the total energy is $\\sqrt{\\hat{s}}$. Since the electron and quark are massless, they each have energy $E_{cm} = \\sqrt{\\hat{s}}/2$.\nLet the initial electron momentum be $\\vec{k}_{cm}$ and the final electron momentum be $\\vec{k}'_{cm}$. Their magnitudes are $|\\vec{k}_{cm}| = |\\vec{k}'_{cm}| = \\sqrt{\\hat{s}}/2$.

Let the four-momenta of the initial deuteron, final proton, and final neutron be $P_d$, $p_p$, and $p_n$ respectively. The four-momentum transferred by the virtual photon is $q$.\n\n1.  **Four-Momentum Conservation:**\n    For the hadronic vertex, the total four-momentum is conserved:\n    $$q + P_d = p_p + p_n$$\n\n2.  **Invariant Mass of the Final Hadronic State:**\n    Let's analyze the invariant mass of the final proton-neutron system, denoted by $W$. The square of the invariant mass, $W^2$, is given by the square of the total four-momentum of the final state:\n    $$W^2 = (p_p + p_n)^2$$\n    Using the conservation of four-momentum, we can express this in terms of the initial state variables:\n    $$W^2 = (q + P_d)^2 = q^2 + P_d^2 + 2 q \\cdot P_d$$\n\n3.  **Expressing $W^2$ in terms of Kinematic Variables:**\n    We are given the following definitions:\n    - $q^2 = -Q^2$\n    - The deuteron is on-shell, so its four-momentum squared is $P_d^2 = M_d^2$.\n    - The Bjorken variable is defined as $x = \\frac{Q^2}{2 M_p \\nu}$.\n    - The energy transfer in the deuteron rest frame is $\\nu = \\frac{P_d \\cdot q}{M_d}$, which implies $q \\cdot P_d = M_d \\nu$.\n\n    We can express the term $q \\cdot P_d$ using the definition of $x$:\n    $$\\nu = \\frac{Q^2}{2 M_p x}$$\n    Therefore,\n    $$q \\cdot P_d = M_d \\nu = M_d \\frac{Q^2}{2 M_p x}$$\n    Substituting these into the expression for $W^2$:\n    $$W^2 = -Q^2 + M_d^2 + 2 \\left( M_d \\frac{Q^2}{2 M_p x} \\right)$$\n    $$W^2 = M_d^2 + Q^2 \\left( \\frac{M_d}{M_p x} - 1 \\right)$$\n\n4.  **Physical Constraint on the Final State:**\n    The problem states that the final proton and neutron are produced on-shell. This means they are free particles with masses $M_p$ and $M_n$. The minimum possible invariant mass for a system of two particles occurs when they are produced with zero relative momentum, i.e., at rest in their center-of-mass frame.\n    In this minimum energy configuration, the total energy is $E_{min} = M_p + M_n$ and the total momentum is $\\vec{P}_{tot} = \\vec{0}$. The corresponding minimum invariant mass squared is:\n    $$W_{min}^2 = (E_{min})^2 - (\\vec{P}_{tot})^2 = (M_p + M_n)^2$$\n    For the reaction to be kinematically possible, the invariant mass of the final hadronic system must be at least this minimum value:\n    $$W^2 \\ge (M_p + M_n)^2$$\n\n5.  **Deriving the Limit on $x$:**\n    We combine the expression for $W^2$ with the physical constraint:\n    $$M_d^2 + Q^2 \\left( \\frac{M_d}{M_p x} - 1 \\right) \\ge (M_p + M_n)^2$$\n    Now, we solve this inequality for $x$:\n    $$Q^2 \\left( \\frac{M_d}{M_p x} - 1 \\right) \\ge (M_p + M_n)^2 - M_d^2$$\n    Since $Q^2>0$ for any scattering process, we can divide by it without changing the inequality direction:\n    $$\\frac{M_d}{M_p x} - 1 \\ge \\frac{(M_p + M_n)^2 - M_d^2}{Q^2}$$\n    $$\\frac{M_d}{M_p x} \\ge 1 + \\frac{(M_p + M_n)^2 - M_d^2}{Q^2}$$\n    Since all quantities ($M_d, M_p, x$) are positive, we can rearrange to find an upper bound on $x$:\n    $$x \\le \\frac{M_d/M_p}{1 + \\frac{(M_p + M_n)^2 - M_d^2}{Q^2}}$$\n\n6.  **Finding the Absolute Maximum Value:**\n    The derived upper bound for $x$ is a function of $Q^2$. The problem asks for the maximum possible value of $x$, which means we must find the supremum of this expression over all possible values of $Q^2$.\n    The deuteron is a bound state, so its mass $M_d$ is less than the sum of the masses of its constituents, $M_d  M_p + M_n$. This implies that the term $(M_p + M_n)^2 - M_d^2$ is positive.\n    Let $C = (M_p + M_n)^2 - M_d^2 > 0$. The upper bound is $x \\le \\frac{M_d/M_p}{1 + C/Q^2}$.\n    This function is monotonically increasing with $Q^2$.
