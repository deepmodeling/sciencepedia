One observable consequence is the structure function $F_3^{\\gamma Z}(x, Q^2)$, where $x$ is the Bjorken scaling variable and $Q^2$ is the momentum transfer squared.\n\nIn the naive quark-parton model (QPM), this structure function is independent of $Q^2$ and can be expressed in terms of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton.
