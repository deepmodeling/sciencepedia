The process is characterized by hadronic structure functions, $F_1(x, Q^2)$ and $F_2(x, Q^2)$. A particularly important quantity is the longitudinal structure function, defined as $F_L(x, Q^2) = F_2(x, Q^2) - 2xF_1(x, Q^2)$, where $x$ is the Bjorken scaling variable and $Q^2$ is the momentum transfer squared.\n\nIn the naive parton model (leading order), quarks are treated as free, point-like particles, which leads to the Callan-Gross relation, $F_L = 0$.
