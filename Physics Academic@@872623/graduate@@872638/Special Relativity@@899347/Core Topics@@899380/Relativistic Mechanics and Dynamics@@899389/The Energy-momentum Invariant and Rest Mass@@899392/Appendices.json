The collision is inelastic, causing the target nucleus to enter an excited state. This excitation requires a transfer of a fixed amount of energy $Q$ into the internal energy of the target.

The four-momentum is $P = (E/c, \\vec{p})$, and its squared magnitude, $P \\cdot P = (E/c)^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2$, is an invariant. Multiplying by $c^4$, we get the invariant quantity $s c^2 = E^2 - (pc)^2$, where $E$ is the total energy of the system and $p$ is the magnitude of the total momentum of the system. This value $s$ is the same in all inertial reference frames and is conserved throughout the collision.\n\nWe will calculate the invariant $s$ for the system before the collision in the laboratory frame and after the collision at the threshold condition.\n\n**1. Before the Collision (Lab Frame)**\n\nThe system consists of the projectile and the stationary target.\n- Projectile: rest mass $m$, kinetic energy $K_{th}$. Its total energy is $E_m = K_{th} + mc^2$. Its momentum is $p_m$.\n- Target: rest mass $M$, stationary. Its total energy is $E_M = Mc^2$.

After the Collision (at Threshold)**\n\nAt the threshold condition, the minimum amount of energy is used. This corresponds to the case where the projectile and the newly excited target nucleus move together with a common final velocity. Essentially, they behave as a single composite particle immediately after the collision.\n\nThe rest mass of this composite system is the sum of the rest masses of its constituents in the final state:\n- Projectile rest mass: $m$\n- Excited target rest mass: $M' = M + Q/c^2$\n\nThe total rest mass of the final composite system is:\n$$ M_{final} = m + M' = m + M + Q/c^2 $$\n\nFor any single particle (or a composite system moving as one), the invariant $(M_{sys}c^2)^2$ is simply the square of its rest energy: $s_{after} = (M_{final}c^2)^2$.\nThus, for the final state at threshold:\n$$ s_{after} = (M_{final}c^2)^2 = \\left( (m+M+Q/c^2)c^2 \\right)^2 = ((m+M)c^2 + Q)^2 $$\n\nThis approach of calculating $s_{after}$ is valid in any frame, as it's an invariant. It is simplest to see in the center-of-momentum (CM) frame, where the final composite particle would be at rest, so its total energy is just its rest energy, and its momentum is zero.\n\n**3.

Let their four-momenta be $p_1, p_2, p_3$. For a massless particle with energy $E_i$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_i$, the relationship $E_i = |\\vec{p}_i|c$ holds.

Therefore:\n$$P = p_1 + p_2 + p_3$$\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible energy for one of the particles, say $E_1$. Let's isolate the four-momenta of the other two particles:\n$$P - p_1 = p_2 + p_3$$\n\nTo find a relationship between the energies, we can square both sides of this equation (i.e., take the Lorentz-invariant inner product of each side with itself):\n$$(P - p_1)^2 = (p_2 + p_3)^2$$\n\nLet's expand both sides.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is:\n$$(P - p_1)^2 = P^2 - 2P \\cdot p_1 + p_1^2$$\nWe know $P^2 = (Mc)^2$ and $p_1^2 = 0$.

To achieve this, we must minimize the left-hand side, $(Mc)^2 - 2ME_1$. This, in turn, requires minimizing the right-hand side. The quantities $E_2$ and $E_3$ are energies, so they are non-negative.
