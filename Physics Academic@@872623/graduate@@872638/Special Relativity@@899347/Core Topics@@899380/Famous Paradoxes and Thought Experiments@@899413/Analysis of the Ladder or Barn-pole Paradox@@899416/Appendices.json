Worldlines of the pole's ends in the lab frame ($S$)**\n\nThe pole has rest length $L_{p0}$ and is oriented along the x-axis in the lab frame $S$. It moves with velocity $\\vec{v}_p = (0, v, 0)$. We can set up the worldlines for the two ends of the pole, which we'll call A and B.

This exercise provides a direct and quantitative way to explore this concept by placing synchronized clocks at each end of the pole. By determining the reading on the rear clock at a key moment, you will see firsthand how events considered simultaneous in one frame are not in another, and how this difference in perspective reconciles the apparent contradiction of the paradox [@problem_id:376757].", "problem": "A pole of proper length $L_p$ travels at a constant relativistic velocity $\\vec{v}$ along the x-axis of a laboratory frame $S$. In this frame, a barn of proper length $L_b$ is at rest, with its front door located at $x=0$ and its back door at $x=L_b$.\n\nTwo clocks, $C_F$ and $C_R$, are attached to the front and rear ends of the pole, respectively. These clocks are perfectly synchronized in the pole's rest frame, $S'$. The synchronization is established such that the clock $C_F$ at the front of the pole reads $t'_F = 0$ at the exact moment the front of the pole passes the front door of the barn.

It is therefore most straightforward to analyze the situation from the perspective of this frame.\n\n1.  **Establish the Coordinate System and Setup in Frame $S'$**\n\nIn the pole's rest frame, $S'$, the pole is stationary. Let's place the front of the pole, where clock $C_F$ is located, at the origin, $x'_F = 0$. The rear of the pole, where clock $C_R$ is located, is then at $x'_R = -L_p$.\n\nThe barn is moving with velocity $-v$ along the x'-axis. Due to Lorentz contraction, the length of the barn as measured in the pole's frame $S'$ is not its proper length $L_b$, but rather the contracted length $L'_b$:\n$$L'_b = \\frac{L_b}{\\gamma} = L_b\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$\nwhere $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Define Event A in Frame $S'$**\n\nEvent A is the moment the front of the pole meets the front door of the barn. In frame $S'$, this occurs at the position of the pole's front, $x'_A = x'_F = 0$. The problem states that the clock at the front of the pole, $C_F$, reads $t'_F=0$ at this event. Since all clocks in the pole's frame are synchronized, the time of Event A in frame $S'$ is $t'_A = 0$. Thus, the spacetime coordinates of Event A are $(t'_A, x'_A) = (0, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Position of the Barn's Doors in Frame $S'$**\n\nSince the barn moves with velocity $-v$ in the $S'$ frame, and its front door is at $x'=0$ at $t'=0$ (Event A), the position of its front door at any time $t'$ is given by:\n$$x'_{barn, F}(t') = -vt'$$\nThe back door of the barn is always a distance $L'_b$ ahead of the front door (in the positive x' direction, as the barn moves towards negative x').

In frame $S'$, the rear of the pole is permanently at $x'_R = -L_p$. Therefore, Event B occurs at the time $t'_B$ when the position of the barn's back door is equal to the position of the pole's rear.\n$$x'_{barn, R}(t'_B) = x'_R$$\n$$-vt'_B + \\frac{L_b}{\\gamma} = -L_p$$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Time of Event B ($t'_B$)**\n\nWe rearrange the equation to solve for $t'_B$:\n$$vt'_B = L_p + \\frac{L_b}{\\gamma}$$\n$$t'_B = \\frac{L_p}{v} + \\frac{L_b}{v\\gamma}$$\nThis time, $t'_B$, is the time coordinate of Event B in the pole's frame $S'$.\n\n6.  **Interpret the Result**\n\nThe clocks $C_F$ and $C_R$ are stationary and synchronized in frame $S'$. The reading of any such clock at a spacetime event $(t', x')$ is simply $t'$. Event B occurs at the spatial location of the rear clock, $C_R$. Therefore, the reading on clock $C_R$ at Event B is precisely $t'_B$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\gamma$, we get the final answer:\n$$t'_B = \\frac{L_p}{v} + \\frac{L_b}{v} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{L_p}{v} + \\frac{L_b}{v} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$", "id": "376757"}, {"introduction": "Thought experiments in relativity often use light signals to probe the structure of spacetime, as their speed is constant in all inertial frames.
