For any time $t' \\ge 0$, ship A is at rest at the origin of its own frame $S'$.

This is larger than the initial separation $L$ in the lab frame. The discrepancy arises from the relativity of simultaneity: the two engine firings, simultaneous in the lab frame $S$, are not simultaneous in frame $S'$. From the perspective of frame $S'$, ship A fires its engine first at $t'=0$. Ship B continues to move relative to A's new frame for a duration of $T' = \\frac{\\gamma vL}{c^2}$ before it fires its own engine, causing the distance to increase beyond the classically expected length-contracted value of $L/\\gamma$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\gamma L} $$", "id": "396841"}, {"introduction": "Our classical intuition suggests that a pursuer can always catch up to a target if they move fast enough for long enough.
