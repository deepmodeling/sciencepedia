The proper time is the time interval measured in the clock's own rest frame. The key principle to solve this problem is the invariance of the spacetime interval under Lorentz transformations.\n\nThe spacetime interval, $\\Delta s^2$, between two events is defined as:\n$$ (\\Delta s)^2 = (c \\Delta t)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2 - (\\Delta y)^2 - (\\Delta z)^2 $$\nwhere $\\Delta t, \\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\Delta z$ are the differences in the time and space coordinates between the two events.\n\nLet's calculate the spacetime interval in the inertial frame $S$. The coordinate differences between event B and event A are:\n$$ \\Delta t = t_B - t_A $$\n$$ \\Delta x = x_B - x_A $$\n$$ \\Delta y = y_B - y_A $$\n$$ \\Delta z = z_B - z_A $$\n\nSubstituting these into the definition of the interval, we get:\n$$ (\\Delta s)^2_S = (c(t_B - t_A))^2 - (x_B - x_A)^2 - (y_B - y_A)^2 - (z_B - z_A)^2 $$\n\nNow, let's consider the rest frame of the moving clock, which we'll call $S'$. In this frame, the clock is stationary. The two events are the clock being at its location at the beginning of the interval and the clock being at the same location at the end of the interval. Therefore, the spatial separation between these two events in the frame $S'$ is zero:\n$$ \\Delta x' = 0, \\quad \\Delta y' = 0, \\quad \\Delta z' = 0 $$\n\nThe time interval measured in this rest frame $S'$ is, by definition, the proper time $\\Delta \\tau$:\n$$ \\Delta t' = \\Delta \\tau $$\n\nThe spacetime interval in the $S'$ frame is then:\n$$ (\\Delta s)^2_{S'} = (c \\Delta t')^2 - (\\Delta x')^2 - (\\Delta y')^2 - (\\Delta z')^2 = (c \\Delta \\tau)^2 - 0 - 0 - 0 = (c \\Delta \\tau)^2 $$\n\nThe principle of relativity states that the spacetime interval is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames.

Since $\\Delta \\tau$ represents an elapsed time, it must be a positive quantity.\n$$ c \\Delta \\tau = \\sqrt{(c(t_B - t_A))^2 - (x_B - x_A)^2 - (y_B - y_A)^2 - (z_B - z_A)^2} $$\n\nFinally, we solve for $\\Delta \\tau$ by dividing by $c$:\n$$ \\Delta \\tau = \\frac{1}{c} \\sqrt{(c(t_B - t_A))^2 - (x_B - x_A)^2 - (y_B - y_A)^2 - (z_B - z_A)^2} $$\n\nThis expression gives the total proper time elapsed on the moving clock.
