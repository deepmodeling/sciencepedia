The key principle to solve this problem efficiently is the invariance of the spacetime interval.\n\nThe spacetime interval, $(\\Delta s)^2$, between two events is an invariant quantity, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames of reference. The interval is defined as:\n$$ (\\Delta s)^2 = (c \\Delta t)^2 - |\\Delta \\vec{r}|^2 $$\nwhere $\\Delta t$ is the temporal separation and $\\Delta \\vec{r}$ is the spatial separation vector between the two events.\n\nLet's denote the quantities in the laboratory frame S with the subscript '0' and in the moving frame S' with a prime.\nIn the laboratory frame S, we are given:\n- Temporal separation: $\\Delta t = T_0$\n- Magnitude of spatial separation: $|\\Delta \\vec{r}| = L_0$\n\nThe spacetime interval calculated in frame S is:\n$$ (\\Delta s)^2 = (c T_0)^2 - L_0^2 $$\n\nIn the moving frame S', we are given:\n- Temporal separation: $\\Delta t' = 2T_0$\n- Magnitude of spatial separation: $|\\Delta \\vec{r}'| = L'$ (this is the quantity we need to find).\n\nThe spacetime interval calculated in frame S' is:\n$$ (\\Delta s')^2 = (c \\Delta t')^2 - |\\Delta \\vec{r}'|^2 = (c (2T_0))^2 - (L')^2 $$\n\nSince the spacetime interval is invariant, $(\\Delta s)^2 = (\\Delta s')^2$. We can equate the expressions for the interval calculated in both frames:\n$$ (c T_0)^2 - L_0^2 = (c (2T_0))^2 - (L')^2 $$\n\nNow, we can solve for $L'$.\n$$ (c T_0)^2 - L_0^2 = 4(c T_0)^2 - (L')^2 $$\n\nRearranging the terms to isolate $(L')^2$:\n$$ (L')^2 = 4(c T_0)^2 - (c T_0)^2 + L_0^2 $$\n$$ (L')^2 = 3(c T_0)^2 + L_0^2 $$\n\nFinally, taking the square root to find the magnitude of the spatial separation $L'$.

Note that since the events are timelike-separated, $cT_0  L_0$, which ensures that $(cT_0)^2 - L_0^2  0$.
