Geometric Interpretation of the Condition**\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for the time coordinate of an event from frame S to frame S' is given by:\n$$t' = \\gamma \\left(t - \\frac{vx}{c^2}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n\nLet's define a new event, M, which is the arithmetic midpoint of the spacetime coordinates of A and B in frame S. Note that this is a coordinate-dependent point, not a Lorentz-invariant one. The coordinates of M in frame S are:\n$$x_M = \\frac{x_A + x_B}{2}$$\n$$t_M = \\frac{t_A + t_B}{2}$$\n\nNow, let's find the time coordinate of event M in frame S', $t'_M$.

Lines of Simultaneity in a Minkowski Diagram**\n\nIn the Minkowski diagram of frame S (with axes $x$ and $ct$), all events that are simultaneous in frame S' lie on a straight line. This line is called a line of simultaneity for frame S'. These lines are parallel to the spatial axis ($x'$-axis) of frame S'.\n\nThe $x'$-axis is defined by the condition $t' = 0$. From the Lorentz transformation for time, $ct' = \\gamma (ct - \\frac{v}{c}x) = 0$, which simplifies to:\n$$ct = \\frac{v}{c}x$$\nThis is the equation of the $x'$-axis in the S-frame's coordinate system. The slope of this line on the $(x, ct)$ diagram is:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta(ct)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{v}{c}$$\nAll lines of simultaneity for frame S' must be parallel to its $x'$-axis and thus share this same slope.\n\n**3. Solving for the Velocity**\n\nSince events C and M must be simultaneous in S', they must lie on the same line of simultaneity. Therefore, the line segment connecting the points C and M in the Minkowski diagram of frame S must have a slope equal to $v/c$.\n\nThe coordinates of the two points are $C(x_C, ct_C)$ and $M\\left(\\frac{x_A+x_B}{2}, c\\frac{t_A+t_B}{2}\\right)$. The slope of the line segment CM is:\n$$m_{CM} = \\frac{\\Delta(ct)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{ct_M - ct_C}{x_M - x_C} = \\frac{c\\left(\\frac{t_A+t_B}{2}\\right) - ct_C}{\\left(\\frac{x_A+x_B}{2}\\right) - x_C}$$\n$$m_{CM} = \\frac{c(t_A+t_B - 2t_C)}{x_A+x_B - 2x_C}$$\n\nEquating this slope to the required slope of a line of simultaneity, $m = v/c$:\n$$\\frac{v}{c} = c \\frac{t_A+t_B - 2t_C}{x_A+x_B - 2x_C}$$\n\nFinally, solving for the velocity $v$:\n$$v = c^2 \\frac{t_A+t_B - 2t_C}{x_A+x_B - 2x_C}$$\nThis is the velocity of the frame S' that satisfies the given condition.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{c^2 \\frac{t_A+t_B - 2t_C}{x_A+x_B - 2x_C}} $$", "id": "388797"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of simultaneity, this exercise delves into one of the most profound consequences of special relativity: the relativity of temporal order.

Setup and Graphical Representation**\n\nWe begin by representing the events in a Minkowski spacetime diagram for the inertial frame S, with the $ct$ axis as the vertical axis and the $x$ axis as the horizontal axis.\n- Event A is at the origin, A=(0,0).\n- Event B is at the coordinates $(X_0, cT_0)$. Since $X_0 > 0$ and $T_0 > 0$, B is in the first quadrant.\n- Event C is at the coordinates $(X_0, -cT_0)$. Since $X_0 > 0$ and $T_0 > 0$, C is in the fourth quadrant.\n\nThe condition for B and C being spacelike separated from A is $(c\\Delta t)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2  0$.\nFor B: $(cT_0)^2 - X_0^2  0 \\implies cT_0  X_0$.\nFor C: $(-cT_0)^2 - X_0^2  0 \\implies cT_0  X_0$.\nThis means both B and C lie outside the light cone originating from A, in the region labeled \"Elsewhere\".\n\nAn inertial observer S' moving with velocity $v$ relative to S has a set of axes $(ct', x')$ in the Minkowski diagram. The $x'$ axis represents the set of events that are simultaneous for this observer. The equation of the $x'$-axis passing through the origin is given by $ct = \\beta x$, where $\\beta = v/c$. This is a line with slope $\\beta$. The physical range of velocities $-c  v  c$ corresponds to slopes $-1  \\beta  1$.\n\n**2. Condition for A occurring before B ($t'_A  t'_B$)**\n\nIn frame S', event A occurs at $t'_A=0$ (since it's at the origin). The condition $t'_A  t'_B$ thus simplifies to $t'_B  0$.\n\nGraphically, this means event B must lie in the \"future\" half-plane defined by the S' observer's line of simultaneity (the $x'$-axis). Since A is at the origin, we require that event B lies \"above\" the line $ct = \\beta x$. The boundary case occurs when A and B are simultaneous, $t'_A = t'_B$. This happens when the line of simultaneity passes through both A and B. The slope of the line connecting A=(0,0) and B=$(X_0, cT_0)$ is:\n$$\n\\beta_{AB} = \\frac{cT_0 - 0}{X_0 - 0} = \\frac{cT_0}{X_0}\n$$\nFor B to be in the \"future\" of A (i.e., $t'_B > 0$), the slope $\\beta$ of the observer's line of simultaneity must be less than the slope of the line of simultaneity that contains B, $\\beta_{AB}$. This can be visualized by rotating the line $ct=\\beta x$ about the origin.\nSo, the condition is $\\beta  \\beta_{AB}$, which means:\n$$\n\\frac{v}{c}  \\frac{cT_0}{X_0} \\implies v  \\frac{c^2 T_0}{X_0}\n$$\n\n**3. Condition for A occurring before C ($t'_A  t'_C$)**\n\nSimilarly, the condition $t'_A  t'_C$ simplifies to $t'_C > 0$. Graphically, event C must also lie above the observer's line of simultaneity $ct = \\beta x$. The boundary case is when A and C are simultaneous, for which the line of simultaneity connects A and C. The slope of the line connecting A=(0,0) and C=$(X_0, -cT_0)$ is:\n$$\n\\beta_{AC} = \\frac{-cT_0 - 0}{X_0 - 0} = -\\frac{cT_0}{X_0}\n$$\nFor C to be in the future of A, the slope $\\beta$ of the observer's line of simultaneity must be less than $\\beta_{AC}$.\n$$\n\\frac{v}{c}  -\\frac{cT_0}{X_0} \\implies v  -\\frac{c^2 T_0}{X_0}\n$$\n\n**4. Algebraic Verification (using Lorentz Transformations)**\n\nThe time coordinate $t'$ in the S' frame is given by the Lorentz transformation:\n$$\nt' = \\gamma \\left( t - \\frac{vx}{c^2} \\right) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\n$$\nFor event A at $(t_A, x_A) = (0,0)$, we have $t'_A = 0$.\nFor event B at $(t_B, x_B) = (T_0, X_0)$:\n$$\nt'_B = \\gamma \\left( T_0 - \\frac{vX_0}{c^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe condition $t'_A  t'_B$ becomes $t'_B  0$. Since $\\gamma  0$, this requires $T_0 - \\frac{vX_0}{c^2}  0$, which gives $v  \\frac{c^2 T_0}{X_0}$.\n\nFor event C at $(t_C, x_C) = (-T_0, X_0)$:\n$$\nt'_C = \\gamma \\left( -T_0 - \\frac{vX_0}{c^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe condition $t'_A  t'_C$ becomes $t'_C  0$. This requires $-T_0 - \\frac{vX_0}{c^2}  0$, which gives $-\\frac{vX_0}{c^2}  T_0$. Since $X_0  0$, this inequality becomes $v  -\\frac{c^2 T_0}{X_0}$.\n\nThe algebraic results confirm the conclusions from the graphical method.\n\n**5. Determining the Velocity Interval $\\mathcal{V}$ and its Measure**\n\nThe set of velocities $\\mathcal{V}$ must satisfy both conditions simultaneously, along with the physical constraint $|v|  c$:\n1. $v  \\frac{c^2 T_0}{X_0}$\n2. $v  -\\frac{c^2 T_0}{X_0}$\n3. $-c  v  c$\n\nSince $T_0, X_0, c$ are all positive, we have $-\\frac{c^2 T_0}{X_0}  \\frac{c^2 T_0}{X_0}$. Therefore, the second condition, $v  -c^2 T_0 / X_0$, is stricter and automatically implies the first.\n\nAlso, from the spacelike separation condition $cT_0  X_0$, we have $\\frac{cT_0}{X_0}  1$. This means $\\frac{c^2 T_0}{X_0}  c$, so the critical velocities are within the physical limits. Specifically, $-c  -c^2 T_0/X_0$.\n\nThe velocity interval $\\mathcal{V}$ is thus defined by the intersection of all conditions:\n$$\n\\mathcal{V} = \\left\\{ v \\mid -c  v  -\\frac{c^2 T_0}{X_0} \\right\\}\n$$\nThis is the interval $\\left(-c, -\\frac{c^2 T_0}{X_0}\\right)$.\n\nThe measure (length) of this interval, denoted by $\\Delta v$, is the difference between its upper and lower bounds:\n$$\n\\Delta v = \\left( -\\frac{c^2 T_0}{X_0} \\right) - (-c) = c - \\frac{c^2 T_0}{X_0}\n$$\nFactoring out $c$, we get the final result.\n$$\n\\Delta v = c \\left( 1 - \\frac{cT_0}{X_0} \\right)\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{c \\left( 1 - \\frac{cT_0}{X_0} \\right)}\n$$", "id": "388820"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice moves from analyzing simultaneity to analyzing perception, addressing the subtle question of what a relativistically moving object actually *looks* like.

Assuming the stick is moving on the positive x-axis, these can be written as:\n$$x_b(t)=d+vt, \\qquad x_f(t)=d+\\frac{L_0}{\\gamma}+vt$$\nHere, $d$ is a position offset, $L_0/\\gamma$ is the stick's Lorentz-contracted length, $v$ is the velocity, and $\\beta = v/c$. A light ray emitted from position $x$ at time $t_e$ arrives at the origin at $t=0$ if $x = c(-t_e)$, which means the emission time is $t_e = -x/c$.\n\nWe apply this condition to both ends of the stick. The emission time $t_b$ for the back end must satisfy $t_b = -x_b(t_b)/c$. Solving this gives the emission position $x_b(t_b) = d/(1+\\beta)$. Similarly, for the front end, solving $t_f = -x_f(t_f)/c$ gives the emission position $x_f(t_f) = (d+L_0/\\gamma)/(1+\\beta)$.\n\nThe apparent length, $L_{app}$, is the difference between these emission-point positions:\n$$L_{app} = x_f(t_f) - x_b(t_b) = \\frac{L_0/\\gamma}{1+\\beta}$$\nWe are given the condition $L_{app}=L_0/2$.
