Object Geometry in the Rest Frame $S'$**\n\nWe align the triangle in its rest frame $S'$ to match the problem description. The motion is parallel to the hypotenuse, so we align the hypotenuse with the $x'$-axis. The triangle is planar, so we place it in the $x'y'$-plane.\n\nA right-angled isosceles triangle has angles $(\\pi/2, \\pi/4, \\pi/4)$. Let the vertices be $A'$, $B'$, and $C'$. We place the hypotenuse $A'B'$ on the $x'$-axis, centered at the origin. Let the half-length of the hypotenuse be $d$. The vertices are:\n$A' = (-d, 0, 0)$\n$B' = (d, 0, 0)$\nThe third vertex $C'$ must lie on the $y'$-axis for the triangle to be isosceles with $A'B'$ as the base. The distance from $C'$ to the midpoint of $A'B'$ (the origin) must be $d$ for the angle at $C'$ to be a right angle. We place it at:\n$C' = (0, d, 0)$\n\nLet's verify the side lengths in $S'$:\n- Length of hypotenuse $A'B' = \\sqrt{(d - (-d))^2} = 2d$.\n- Length of side $A'C' = \\sqrt{(0 - (-d))^2 + (d - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{d^2+d^2} = d\\sqrt{2}$.\n- Length of side $B'C' = \\sqrt{(d - 0)^2 + (0 - d)^2} = \\sqrt{d^2+d^2} = d\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $(A'C')^2 + (B'C')^2 = (d\\sqrt{2})^2 + (d\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2d^2 + 2d^2 = 4d^2 = (2d)^2 = (A'B')^2$, the triangle is indeed right-angled at $C'$. This setup is consistent with the problem statement. The plane of the triangle is the $x'y'$-plane.\n\n**2. Observation Conditions**\n\nThe observer is in frame $S$. The triangle's plane is the $xy$-plane (at any given instant in $S$), and its velocity is $\\vec{v} = v\\hat{x}$. The problem states that the line of sight is perpendicular to both the plane of the triangle and the velocity vector. The velocity is in the $xy$-plane (along $\\hat{x}$). The line of sight must be perpendicular to the $xy$-plane, which means it is along the $z$-axis.\n\nLet's assume the observer is at a very large distance $D$ on the positive $z$-axis, i.e., at $(0, 0, D)$. The light rays from the triangle travel towards the observer nearly parallel to the $-z$ axis. The direction of propagation of light in the observer's frame $S$ is given by the unit vector $\\hat{k}_S = (0, 0, -1)$.\n\n**3. Aberration of Light**\n\nWe need to find the direction of light propagation $\\hat{k}'$ in the triangle's rest frame $S'$. We use the relativistic velocity transformation formulas. Let $\\vec{u}$ be the velocity of light in $S$, and $\\vec{u}'$ be its velocity in $S'$.\n$\\vec{u} = c \\hat{k}_S = (0, 0, -c)$.\nThe velocity of $S'$ with respect to $S$ is $\\vec{v} = (v, 0, 0)$.\nThe inverse transformation for velocity components is:\n$u_x' = \\frac{u_x - v}{1 - u_x v/c^2} = \\frac{0 - v}{1 - 0} = -v = -c\\beta$\n$u_y' = \\frac{u_y}{\\gamma(1 - u_x v/c^2)} = \\frac{0}{\\gamma(1 - 0)} = 0$\n$u_z' = \\frac{u_z}{\\gamma(1 - u_x v/c^2)} = \\frac{-c}{\\gamma(1 - 0)} = -c/\\gamma$\n\nSo, the velocity of light in $S'$ is $\\vec{u}' = (-c\\beta, 0, -c/\\gamma)$. The direction of light propagation in $S'$ is:\n$\\hat{k}' = \\frac{\\vec{u}'}{c} = (-\\beta, 0, -1/\\gamma)$\n\n**4. Apparent Shape Calculation**\n\nThe apparent shape of the distant object is its projection onto the \"plane of the sky\". This plane is perpendicular to the line of sight in the rest frame, i.e., perpendicular to $\\hat{k}'$. Let's find an orthonormal basis $\\{\\hat{u}_1', \\hat{u}_2'\\}$ for this plane.\n- Let $\\hat{u}_1'$ be in the $x'z'$-plane and orthogonal to $\\hat{k}' = (-\\beta, 0, -1/\\gamma)$. A suitable normalized choice is $\\hat{u}_1' = (1/\\gamma, 0, -\\beta)$.\n- Let $\\hat{u}_2'$ be orthogonal to the $x'z'$-plane. The natural choice is $\\hat{u}_2' = (0, 1, 0)$. It is a unit vector and is orthogonal to both $\\hat{k}'$ and $\\hat{u}_1'$.\n\nThe apparent coordinates $(\\xi, \\eta)$ of a vertex $P'$ with position vector $\\vec{r}_{P'}'$ are given by the projections:\n$\\xi_P = \\vec{r}_{P'}' \\cdot \\hat{u}_1'$\n$\\eta_P = \\vec{r}_{P'}' \\cdot \\hat{u}_2'$\n\nLet's find the apparent coordinates of the vertices $A'$, $B'$, and $C'$:\n- For $A' = (-d, 0, 0)$:\n  $\\xi_A = (-d, 0, 0) \\cdot (1/\\gamma, 0, -\\beta) = -d/\\gamma$\n  $\\eta_A = (-d, 0, 0) \\cdot (0, 1, 0) = 0$\n  So, $A_{app} = (-d/\\gamma, 0)$.\n\n- For $B' = (d, 0, 0)$:\n  $\\xi_B = (d, 0, 0) \\cdot (1/\\gamma, 0, -\\beta) = d/\\gamma$\n  $\\eta_B = (d, 0, 0) \\cdot (0, 1, 0) = 0$\n  So, $B_{app} = (d/\\gamma, 0)$.\n\n- For $C' = (0, d, 0)$:\n  $\\xi_C = (0, d, 0) \\cdot (1/\\gamma, 0, -\\beta) = 0$\n  $\\eta_C = (0, d, 0) \\cdot (0, 1, 0) = d$\n  So, $C_{app} = (0, d)$.\n\n**5. Condition for an Equilateral Triangle**\n\nThe apparent triangle has vertices $A_{app}$, $B_{app}$, $C_{app}$. For this triangle to be equilateral, the squared lengths of its sides must be equal. Let's calculate them.\n- $L_{AB}^2 = (\\xi_B - \\xi_A)^2 + (\\eta_B - \\eta_A)^2 = (d/\\gamma - (-d/\\gamma))^2 + (0 - 0)^2 = (2d/\\gamma)^2 = \\frac{4d^2}{\\gamma^2}$.\n- $L_{AC}^2 = (\\xi_C - \\xi_A)^2 + (\\eta_C - \\eta_A)^2 = (0 - (-d/\\gamma))^2 + (d - 0)^2 = (d/\\gamma)^2 + d^2 = d^2(1/\\gamma^2 + 1)$.\n- $L_{BC}^2 = (\\xi_C - \\xi_B)^2 + (\\eta_C - \\eta_B)^2 = (0 - d/\\gamma)^2 + (d - 0)^2 = (-d/\\gamma)^2 + d^2 = d^2(1/\\gamma^2 + 1)$.\n\nThe apparent triangle is always isosceles with $L_{AC} = L_{BC}$. For it to be equilateral, we must have $L_{AB}^2 = L_{AC}^2$.\n$$ \\frac{4d^2}{\\gamma^2} = d^2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} + 1\\right) $$\nThe parameter $d$ cancels out, as expected.\n$$ \\frac{4}{\\gamma^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} + 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{3}{\\gamma^2} = 1 \\implies \\gamma^2 = 3 $$\nNow, we substitute the definition of the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$.\n$$ \\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1-\\beta^2} = 3 $$\n$$ 1 = 3(1-\\beta^2) = 3 - 3\\beta^2 $$\n$$ 3\\beta^2 = 2 $$\n$$ \\beta^2 = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nSince $\\beta$ must be positive, we take the positive root.\n$$ \\beta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} $$\nThis value is less than 1, so it is a physically attainable speed.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}} $$", "id": "400742"}]}
