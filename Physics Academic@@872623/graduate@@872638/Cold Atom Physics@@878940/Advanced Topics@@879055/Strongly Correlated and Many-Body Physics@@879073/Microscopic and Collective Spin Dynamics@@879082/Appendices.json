This first exercise explores a ubiquitous source of dephasing: atomic motion through an inhomogeneous magnetic field.

The atoms have a gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$. They are subjected to a static magnetic field aligned along the z-axis, which has a constant background component $B_0$ and a constant gradient $\\beta$. The total magnetic field is thus given by $\\vec{B}(z) = (B_0 + \\beta z) \\hat{k}$.\n\nInitially, at $t=0$, all atoms are prepared in the spin-down state $|{\\downarrow}\\rangle$ (the eigenstate of the spin operator $S_z$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar/2$). Immediately after preparation, they are all located at the plane $z=0$.\n\nA Ramsey sequence is then applied:\n1.  At $t=0$, an ideal, instantaneous $\\pi/2$ pulse is applied, which rotates the spins by an angle of $\\pi/2$ about the y-axis.\n2.  The atoms evolve freely for a duration $T_R$. During this time, they undergo one-dimensional Brownian motion along the z-axis. The diffusion process is characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D$. For any given atom, its position $z(t)$ is a stochastic process with the properties $\\langle z(t) \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle z(t_1) z(t_2) \\rangle = 2D \\min(t_1, t_2)$, where the angle brackets denote an average over all possible diffusive trajectories.\n3.  At $t=T_R$, a second, identical $\\pi/2$ pulse is applied. The population difference between the spin-up and spin-down states is then measured.\n\nThe measured signal exhibits oscillations as a function of $T_R$, known as Ramsey fringes. Due to the dephasing caused by atomic diffusion in the magnetic field gradient, the amplitude of these fringes, or the fringe contrast, decays with increasing $T_R$.\n\nCalculate the fringe contrast $C(T_R)$, normalized such that $C(0)=1$.
