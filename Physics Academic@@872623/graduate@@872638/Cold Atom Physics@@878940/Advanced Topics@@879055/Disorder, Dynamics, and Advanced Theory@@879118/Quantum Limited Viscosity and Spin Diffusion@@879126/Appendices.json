The gas is confined by an external harmonic potential $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 x^2$ and is in thermal equilibrium at a high temperature $T$. Due to the high temperature and low density, the gas can be accurately described using classical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. The total number of spin-up and spin-down particles are equal, meaning the gas is globally unpolarized. The peak density of the gas at the trap center ($x=0$) is denoted by $n(0)$.\n\nWe are interested in the transport of spin polarization within this gas.

However, in a confining trap, transport is still finite because particles are coherently turned around by the trapping potential. The characteristic time scale for this process sets an effective relaxation time. Assume that this effective spin relaxation time can be modeled as $\\tau_{eff} = 1/\\omega$. Use a simple Drude-like model based on this relaxation time to determine the spin conductivity.\n\nYour task is to calculate the spin diffusion coefficient $D_s$ at the center of the trap, $x=0$.", "solution": "We start from the Einstein relation at the trap center $x=0$,\n$$\nD_s \\;=\\;\\frac{\\sigma_s}{\\chi_s}\\,.\n$$\n\n1.
