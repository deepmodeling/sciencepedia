This first exercise provides practice with the foundational step: calculating a one-loop correction. By considering an electron in a quantum well, we can directly connect the polaron's self-energy, arising from the Fröhlich interaction, to a physically measurable quantity—the force exerted on the well's boundaries [@problem_id:1275622].", "problem": "An electron is confined within a planar quantum well of thickness $L$, oriented perpendicular to the z-axis. The material within the well is a polar semiconductor, which is described by the Fröhlich model. This model accounts for the interaction between the electron and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons.\n\nDue to the confinement, we will model the system with the following simplifying assumptions:\n1.  The electron is restricted to the lowest energy subband of the quantum well.\n2.  The phonon modes are also confined. For simplicity, we assume an effective model where the electron interacts only with a single family of confined phonon modes, whose wavevector component in the z-direction is quantized to the lowest possible value, $q_z = \\pi/L$.\n3.  Under these assumptions, the system can be treated as effectively two-dimensional. The squared matrix element of the electron-phonon interaction for an in-plane phonon wavevector $\\mathbf{q}_{||}$ is given by:\n    $$ |V_{\\mathbf{q}_{||}}|^2 = \\frac{g^2}{\\mathcal{A}} \\frac{1}{q_{||}^2 + (\\pi/L)^2} $$\n    where $q_{||} = |\\mathbf{q}_{||}|$, $\\mathcal{A}$ is the quantization area in the x-y plane, and $g$ is an effective coupling constant with units of energy times length.\n4.  The LO phonons are considered to be dispersionless, with a constant energy $\\hbar\\omega_{LO}$.\n5.  The electron has a constant effective mass $m$.\n\nThe interaction with phonons modifies the ground state energy of the electron. This energy correction, $\\Delta E_g$, depends on the well thickness $L$. This dependence results in a force, $F = -d(\\Delta E_g)/dL$, acting on the confining boundaries of the quantum well.\n\nCalculate this force $F$ in the limit of a large well thickness $L$, where terms of order $1/L^2$ and higher can be neglected. Your calculation should be based on the one-loop (second-order perturbation theory) correction to the electron's ground state energy.
