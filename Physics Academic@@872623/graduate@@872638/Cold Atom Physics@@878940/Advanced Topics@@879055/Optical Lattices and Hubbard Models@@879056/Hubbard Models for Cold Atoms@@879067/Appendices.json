It has been realized with exquisite control using ultracold atoms in optical lattices. The Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$ H = -J \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} (b_i^\\dagger b_j + b_j^\\dagger b_i) + \\frac{U}{2} \\sum_i \\hat{n}_i(\\hat{n}_i - 1) - \\mu \\sum_i \\hat{n}_i $$\nHere, $b_i^\\dagger$ and $b_i$ are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators on site $i$, and $\\hat{n}_i = b_i^\\dagger b_i$ is the number operator. The sum $\\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle}$ is over all pairs of nearest-neighbor sites on a lattice with coordination number $z$. The parameters are the tunneling or hopping amplitude $J$, the on-site interaction strength $U$, and the chemical potential $\\mu$.\n\nIn the limit of strong interactions and weak tunneling ($J \\ll U$), the system enters a Mott insulator phase. For an appropriate chemical potential, the ground state $|G\\rangle$ has an integer number of atoms, $n_0$, on every lattice site. This can be written as $|G\\rangle = |n_0, n_0, \\dots, n_0\\rangle$.\n\nThe stability of this Mott phase is determined by the energy required to create excitations. A \"particle\" excitation corresponds to adding an atom to the system, resulting in a state with one site having $n_0+1$ atoms. A \"hole\" excitation corresponds to removing an atom, leaving one site with $n_0-1$ atoms. The phase boundary of the Mott insulator is reached when the energy cost for creating one of these excitations becomes zero.\n\nThe upper boundary of the $n_0$-th Mott lobe is defined by the chemical potential $\\mu_+$ at which the energy to add a single particle to the system vanishes. In the absence of tunneling ($J=0$), the states corresponding to adding a particle to any of the $M$ sites are degenerate. For non-zero $J$, this degeneracy is lifted, and the particle excitations form an energy band. The minimum energy of this band determines the new phase boundary.\n\n**Problem:**\nConsider the Bose-Hubbard model on a lattice with coordination number $z$. Assume the system is in a Mott insulating state with average filling $n_0$. Using first-order degenerate perturbation theory, determine the chemical potential $\\mu_+$ corresponding to the upper boundary of this Mott lobe.

A \"particle\" excitation at site $i$ results in $n_0+1$ atoms on that site. The unperturbed excitation energy $\\Delta E^{(0)}$ is the energy difference between this state and the ground state (per site):\n    $$ \\Delta E^{(0)} = \\left[\\frac{U}{2}(n_0+1)n_0-\\mu(n_0+1)\\right] - \\left[\\frac{U}{2}n_0(n_0-1)-\\mu n_0\\right] = U n_0 - \\mu $$\n\n2.  **Degenerate subspace.** At $J=0$, the extra particle can be placed on any of the $M$ lattice sites, leading to $M$ degenerate states. We label these states as $|i\\rangle$, representing the state with one extra particle on site $i$.\n\n3.  **First-order correction.** The perturbation $V$ connects these degenerate states. The matrix element of $V$ between two states where the extra particle is on neighboring sites $i$ and $j$ is:\n    $$ \\langle i|V|j\\rangle = -J(n_0+1) $$\n    The effective Hamiltonian in the degenerate subspace is a tight-binding model with an effective hopping amplitude of $T_{\\text{eff}} = J(n_0+1)$.

This is the first-order energy correction:\n    $$ \\Delta E^{(1)} = -z J(n_0+1) $$\n\n4.  **Boundary condition.** The phase boundary is reached when the total energy to create the lowest-energy particle excitation vanishes:\n    $$ \\Delta E^{(0)} + \\Delta E^{(1)} = 0 $$\n    $$ U n_0 - \\mu - zJ(n_0+1) = 0 $$\n    Solving for the chemical potential gives the upper boundary of the Mott lobe:\n    $$ \\mu_+ = U n_0 - zJ(n_0+1) $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mu_+ = U n_0 - zJ(n_0+1)}$$", "id": "1247728"}, {"introduction": "The Hubbard model's utility extends to describing thermal properties of strongly correlated systems, which are directly accessible in cold atom experiments.
