Consider a finite SSH chain consisting of $2N$ sites, indexed by $j=1, 2, \\dots, 2N$. The Hamiltonian for this system is given by:\n$$\nH = \\sum_{j=1}^{2N-1} t_j (c_j^\\dagger c_{j+1} + c_{j+1}^\\dagger c_j)\n$$\nwhere $c_j^\\dagger$ and $c_j$ are the creation and annihilation operators for a fermion at site $j$. The hopping amplitudes $t_j$ are staggered, with $t_{2n-1} = t_1$ for intracell hopping and $t_{2n} = t_2$ for intercell hopping, where $n=1, \\dots, N$. Specifically, the sequence of hopping strengths is $t_1, t_2, t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_2, t_1$. Let $t_1$ and $t_2$ be real and positive constants.\n\nIn the topological regime, which occurs when $t_2  t_1$, an infinitely long chain ($N \\to \\infty$) hosts two exactly-zero energy states, one localized at each end of the chain. For a finite chain, these two states, called edge states, can hybridize, lifting the degeneracy and resulting in a small energy splitting.\n\nYour task is to calculate this energy splitting, $\\Delta E$, between the two nearly-zero energy levels.

In the topological regime $t_2 > t_1$, we define $r = t_1/t_2  1$. There are two nearly-zero energy modes localized at the ends. We construct approximate eigenstates $|\\phi_L\\rangle$ and $|\\phi_R\\rangle$ and project the Hamiltonian onto this low-energy subspace.\n\n1.  **Ansatz for Edge Modes:**\n    The left edge mode, $|\\phi_L\\rangle$, is non-zero primarily on odd sites: $\\phi_L(2n-1)=A(-r)^{n-1}$ for $n=1,\\dots,N$, and $\\phi_L(2n)=0$.\n    The right edge mode, $|\\phi_R\\rangle$, is non-zero primarily on even sites: $\\phi_R(2n)=A(-r)^{N-n}$ for $n=1,\\dots,N$, and $\\phi_R(2n-1)=0$.\n\n2.  **Normalization:** The normalization constant $A$ is found by requiring $\\langle\\phi_L|\\phi_L\\rangle=1$.
