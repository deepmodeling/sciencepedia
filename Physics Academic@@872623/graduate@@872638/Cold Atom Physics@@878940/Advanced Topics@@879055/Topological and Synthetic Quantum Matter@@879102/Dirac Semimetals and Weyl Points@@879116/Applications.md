## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the fundamental principles governing Dirac and Weyl semimetals, focusing on their unique band structures, the topological nature of their band-touching points, and the role of symmetry. Having built this theoretical foundation, we now shift our focus to the rich and diverse consequences of these principles. This chapter explores how the exotic properties of Dirac and Weyl fermions manifest in measurable phenomena and forge connections to a wide array of scientific disciplines. We will not revisit the core concepts in detail but rather demonstrate their profound utility and impact in [experimental physics](@entry_id:264797), [materials engineering](@entry_id:162176), and even in bridging [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) with high-energy physics and cosmology.

### Experimental Signatures and Material Realizations

The theoretical prediction of [topological semimetals](@entry_id:137800) has been followed by an intense experimental search, leading to the discovery and characterization of numerous candidate materials. Dirac semimetals, which require both time-reversal and [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948) for the protection of their four-fold degenerate nodes, are found in materials such as cadmium arsenide ($Cd_3As_2$) and sodium bismuthide ($Na_3Bi$). $Cd_3As_2$, in particular, is often referred to as a "three-dimensional graphene" due to its remarkably high [carrier mobility](@entry_id:268762) and linear energy dispersion in all three momentum directions. Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277), which require the breaking of either time-reversal or [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948), were first identified in the tantalum arsenide family of compounds (TaAs, TaP, NbAs, NbP). These [non-centrosymmetric materials](@entry_id:181206) exhibit pairs of Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, whose topological character is confirmed by the observation of a hallmark signature: Fermi arc [surface states](@entry_id:137922) that connect the projections of bulk Weyl nodes on the surface Brillouin zone [@problem_id:1827864].

Beyond basic identification, the non-[trivial topology](@entry_id:154009) of these materials is directly revealed through a variety of experimental probes, most notably magnetotransport measurements. One of the most definitive fingerprints of Dirac and Weyl fermions is a non-trivial Berry phase acquired by charge carriers as they traverse a closed loop in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). This phase can be directly measured via quantum oscillation phenomena, such as the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) effect. In an SdH experiment, the magnetoresistivity oscillates periodically in the inverse magnetic field, $1/B$. By plotting the integer indices of the oscillation extrema (corresponding to Landau levels crossing the Fermi energy) against $1/B$, a "Landau fan plot" is constructed. The intercept of a linear fit to this plot reveals the phase offset, which is directly related to the Berry phase. For conventional electrons with a parabolic dispersion, the Berry phase is zero. In stark contrast, for the closed Fermi surfaces enclosing a Dirac or Weyl point, the analysis consistently yields a Berry phase of $\pi$, providing unambiguous evidence of the non-[trivial topology](@entry_id:154009) of the quasiparticles [@problem_id:1827827].

Another pivotal transport signature, unique to Weyl semimetals, is the negative longitudinal magnetoconductivity arising from the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077). When parallel electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf{E} \parallel \mathbf{B}$) are applied, a dissipationless current of charge is "pumped" between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. This pumping process, a direct consequence of the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077), would lead to an unbounded accumulation of chiral charge if not for inter-valley scattering processes that relax the population imbalance over a characteristic time $\tau$. In a steady state, the balance between anomalous pumping and relaxation results in a net current parallel to the applied fields. This manifests as a positive contribution to the longitudinal conductivity, which is quadratic in the magnetic field strength ($ \sigma_{zz} \propto B^2 $). The observation of this large, positive magnetoconductivity is a key experimental confirmation of the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) in a condensed matter setting [@problem_id:1239099].

Optical spectroscopy provides a complementary tool for probing the electronic structure. The [optical conductivity](@entry_id:139437), $\sigma(\omega)$, measures the material's response to an oscillating electric field of frequency $\omega$ and is sensitive to [interband transitions](@entry_id:138793). For Dirac and Weyl semimetals, the linear dispersion of the cones leads to a characteristic frequency dependence of the conductivity. Interestingly, even in more complex cases, such as a type-I Weyl semimetal where the cone is tilted, optical measurements can distill the fundamental parameters. For instance, at zero temperature and with the chemical potential at the node, the real part of the interband [optical conductivity](@entry_id:139437) parallel to the tilt direction is found to be independent of the tilt velocity. This allows for a direct probe of the underlying, untilted Weyl cone's Fermi velocity, showcasing how [optical response](@entry_id:138303) can disentangle different parameters of the Hamiltonian [@problem_id:1239154].

### Engineering Topological Phases and Responses

The profound understanding of the symmetries that protect [topological phases](@entry_id:141674) has opened the door to engineering them on demand. Rather than being limited to naturally occurring materials, physicists can now manipulate systems to create and control topological states using external fields, mechanical strain, or by designing specific interfaces and defects.

A particularly vibrant frontier is "Floquet engineering," which uses [periodic driving](@entry_id:146581), typically with strong, off-resonant laser fields, to create effective time-independent Hamiltonians with novel properties. When applied to a Dirac or Weyl system, this technique can fundamentally alter its topological character. For example, irradiating a 2D Dirac semimetal (such as graphene or the surface state of a 3D topological insulator) with circularly polarized light breaks time-reversal symmetry and can open a non-trivial topological gap at the Dirac point. The system is thereby transformed into a "Floquet [topological insulator](@entry_id:137103)," an analogue of a quantum Hall insulator where the role of the magnetic field is played by the light field [@problem_id:1239095]. Similarly, starting with a 3D Dirac semimetal, a periodic drive can be used to break the necessary symmetries that protect the Dirac point, splitting it into a pair of "Floquet-Weyl" points. The momentum-space separation of these light-induced Weyl points can be controlled by the parameters of the laser, such as its intensity and frequency [@problem_id:1251194].

Mechanical strain offers another powerful route to controlling topological phases. Deformations of the crystal lattice can act as effective [gauge fields](@entry_id:159627) coupling to the low-energy quasiparticles. A compelling theoretical proposal involves applying a uniform [torsional strain](@entry_id:195818) to a cylindrical [nanowire](@entry_id:270003) of a Dirac semimetal. The twisting motion explicitly breaks rotational symmetry, introducing a perturbation that acts as an effective axial vector potential. This term splits the original four-fold degenerate Dirac point into a pair of two-fold degenerate Weyl points, separated along the axis of the [nanowire](@entry_id:270003). The magnitude of this momentum-space separation is directly proportional to the applied twist rate, providing a mechanical knob to tune the material from a Dirac to a Weyl semimetal [@problem_id:1239169].

Topological phenomena also emerge at engineered interfaces and naturally occurring [crystal defects](@entry_id:144345). A foundational concept, first explored in [high-energy physics](@entry_id:181260) by Jackiw and Rebbi, predicts that a [domain wall](@entry_id:156559) where a mass term changes sign must host a localized, massless fermionic mode. This principle finds a direct realization in Dirac semimetals. If a mass term that breaks [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948) is engineered to have a domain wall profile (e.g., varying as $M(z) = M_0 \tanh(z/L)$), a two-dimensional sheet of chiral bound states will be localized at the $z=0$ interface. These modes are topologically protected and exhibit a massless, [linear dispersion relation](@entry_id:266313), propagating freely along the domain wall [@problem_id:1239106]. Furthermore, topological [line defects](@entry_id:142385) in the crystal lattice, such as [screw dislocations](@entry_id:182908), can also give rise to exotic electronic phenomena. A [screw dislocation](@entry_id:161513) can be modeled as a source of a constant, uniform axial magnetic field concentrated along the dislocation line. In a Weyl semimetal with a finite chemical potential, this effective field drives an equilibrium charge current that flows along the [dislocation core](@entry_id:201451), a direct manifestation of the [chiral magnetic effect](@entry_id:143193) bound to a crystal defect [@problem_id:1239180].

### Interdisciplinary Connections and Exotic Phenomena

The conceptual framework of Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) extends far beyond their immediate material context, establishing profound connections with other subfields of [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660), as well as [high-energy physics](@entry_id:181260), quantum [field theory](@entry_id:155241), and hydrodynamics.

In the realm of **[mesoscopic physics](@entry_id:138415)**, the unique properties of the chiral zeroth Landau level (ZLL) in a Weyl semimetal give rise to distinct [quantum transport](@entry_id:138932) signatures. When a constriction, or [quantum point contact](@entry_id:142961), made from a Weyl semimetal is subjected to a strong magnetic field parallel to the current flow, transport is dominated by the ZLL. This level is special because its [group velocity](@entry_id:147686) depends on its [chirality](@entry_id:144105), meaning it propagates in only one direction. It therefore acts as a perfect, reflectionless transport channel. According to the Landauer-Büttiker formalism, the conductance of such a constriction becomes quantized in a peculiar way: it is not a universal constant, but is instead proportional to the magnetic flux ($G \propto BA$) piercing the cross-sectional area of the contact. This provides a direct link between a macroscopic transport property and the microscopic chiral nature of the Weyl fermions [@problem_id:1239108].

While [linear response theory](@entry_id:140367) has been instrumental in identifying [topological materials](@entry_id:142123), **nonlinear phenomena** can unveil even deeper geometric properties of the electronic wavefunctions. In Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) that lack [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948), such as those with tilted cones, a DC electric field can generate a transverse Hall current that is of second order in the field strength. This "nonlinear Hall effect" is forbidden in systems with [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948). Its origin lies in the Berry curvature dipole, a quantity that measures the average gradient of the Berry curvature over the occupied states on the Fermi surface. A non-zero Berry curvature dipole, and thus a nonlinear Hall effect, arises precisely because the tilted cone structure creates an asymmetric distribution of Berry curvature in momentum space [@problem_id:1239126].

The interplay between Weyl fermions and **superconductivity** is another fertile research area. When a Weyl semimetal is brought into proximity with a conventional s-wave superconductor, the resulting hybrid system can host exotic [bound states](@entry_id:136502) in the cores of superconducting vortices. These are the [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) analogues of Caroli-de Gennes–Matricon (CdGM) states. For a vortex line penetrating a simple Weyl superconductor, a zero-energy CdGM state is predicted to exist. The topological nature of this state is highlighted by its robustness; a perturbation that would normally gap out the Weyl point and give a mass to the fermions may leave the [vortex state](@entry_id:204018) at precisely zero energy, a protection that stems from its unique particle-hole and [spin structure](@entry_id:157768) [@problem_id:1239188].

Perhaps the most profound connections are to **high-energy physics and quantum field theory**. The effective theory of electromagnetism inside a Weyl semimetal is modified by a topological axion term, $\mathcal{L}_{\theta} = (\theta e^2 / 4\pi^2\hbar) \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$, where the effective [axion angle](@entry_id:139420) $\theta$ is proportional to the momentum-space separation of the Weyl nodes. This term leads to a remarkable prediction known as the Witten effect: a magnetic monopole placed inside such a material will induce an electric charge density in its vicinity. The total induced charge is topologically quantized, being directly proportional to the monopole strength and the [axion angle](@entry_id:139420) $\theta$ [@problem_id:1239167].

The [quantum anomalies](@entry_id:187539) that define Weyl fermions also have consequences for the material's **hydrodynamic** properties. The scale anomaly (or [trace anomaly](@entry_id:150746)) of the underlying Weyl [field theory](@entry_id:155241) dictates that the system's pressure will respond to a uniform compression or expansion. This response can be modeled phenomenologically: a dynamic change in the lattice volume pumps an axial chemical potential between nodes, which then relaxes over time. This process of pumping and relaxation is inherently dissipative and manifests as an anomalous contribution to the material's [bulk viscosity](@entry_id:187773). This quantum effect provides a fascinating link between the microscopic chiral nature of the electrons and the macroscopic fluid-like behavior of the [electron gas](@entry_id:140692) [@problem_id:1239104].

Finally, the very existence of the Weyl quasiparticles as a sea of gapless fermions leads to observable **quantum vacuum effects**, such as the Casimir effect. Just as the [vacuum fluctuations](@entry_id:154889) of the electromagnetic field lead to an attractive force between two parallel conducting plates, the [vacuum fluctuations](@entry_id:154889) of the Weyl fermion field within a slab of material also produce a pressure on its boundaries. Calculations show that this pressure scales with the inverse fourth power of the slab thickness ($P_C \propto L^{-4}$), and, in contrast to the familiar photonic case, the resulting force is typically repulsive, tending to expand the slab. This demonstrates that the Weyl quasiparticles constitute a true quantum field whose vacuum energy has physically measurable consequences [@problem_id:1239183].

In summary, the study of Dirac and Weyl semimetals has transcended its origins in theoretical [band structure calculations](@entry_id:270613) to become a cornerstone of modern condensed matter physics. Its applications range from concrete proposals for novel electronic devices to profound explorations of quantum [field theory](@entry_id:155241) concepts in a tangible laboratory setting, promising a continued wealth of scientific discovery.
