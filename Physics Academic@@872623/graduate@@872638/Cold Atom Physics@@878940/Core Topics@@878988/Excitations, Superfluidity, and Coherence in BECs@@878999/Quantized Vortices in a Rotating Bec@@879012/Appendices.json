A key process governing the evolution of a vortex tangle is reconnection, where two vortex lines approach, cross, and exchange segments. The velocity of a point on a vortex line can be described by the Local Induction Approximation (LIA), which states that the velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is proportional to the local curvature. For a vortex line parameterized by its arc length $s$, its position vector is $\\mathbf{s}(s)$, and the velocity is given by $\\mathbf{v} = \\beta (\\mathbf{s}' \\times \\mathbf{s}'')$, where primes denote differentiation with respect to $s$.

After the event, the structure evolves in a self-similar manner. We can characterize the geometry of the expanding reconnection region by two key length scales:\n1.  $L(t)$: The separation distance between the two \"reconnection points\" (sharp bends or \"kinks\") that propagate away from the initial reconnection site along the paths of the original vortex lines.\n2.  $\\delta(t)$: The separation distance between the two newly formed vortex strands at the center of the structure (i.e., at the point of the initial reconnection).\n\nA simplified model for the dynamics, based on the LIA, yields a coupled system of equations for these two length scales. The propagation speed of the kinks, $dL/dt$, is driven by the curvature of the central bridge structure, which scales inversely with its separation, $\\delta(t)$. Conversely, the rate of separation of the central bridge, $d\\delta/dt$, is driven by the curvature of the propagating kinks, which scales inversely with their separation, $L(t)$.
