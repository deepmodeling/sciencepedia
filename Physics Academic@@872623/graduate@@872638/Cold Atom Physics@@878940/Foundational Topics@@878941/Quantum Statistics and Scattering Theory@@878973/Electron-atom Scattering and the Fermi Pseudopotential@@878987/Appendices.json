This interaction can often be modeled by an effective zero-range potential, known as the Fermi pseudopotential, whose strength is determined by a single parameter: the s-wave scattering length, $a_s$. To determine $a_s$ for a realistic interaction potential, one must solve the low-energy scattering problem.\n\nConsider a particle of mass $m$ scattering off a static, spherically symmetric potential given by an attractive delta-shell:\n$$ V(r) = -V_0 \\delta(r-R) $$\nwhere $V_0$ and $R$ are positive constants. The s-wave scattering length, $a_s$, is defined from the behavior of the $l=0$ radial wave function, $u(r) = r\\psi(r)$, in the zero-energy limit ($E \\to 0$). Specifically, for distances beyond the range of the potential ($r  R$), the wave function has the form $u(r) \\propto (r - a_s)$.\n\nYour task is to calculate the s-wave scattering length $a_s$ for this potential. Express your answer in terms of $m$, $V_0$, $R$, and the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$.", "solution": "The s-wave scattering length is determined by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) at zero energy ($E=0$) for the $l=0$ radial wave function $u(r)$. The radial TISE for $u(r)$ is:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2u(r)}{dr^2} + V(r) u(r) = 0 $$\nFor the given potential $V(r) = -V_0\\delta(r-R)$, the equation becomes:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2u(r)}{dr^2} - V_0 \\delta(r-R) u(r) = 0 $$\n\nWe solve this equation in two regions, $0  r  R$ and $r  R$, and then match the solutions at $r=R$.\n\n**Region 1: $0  r  R$**\nIn this region, $V(r)=0$. The TISE simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u_(r)}{dr^2} = 0 $$\nThe general solution is $u_(r) = Ar + B$. The physical wave function must be regular at the origin, which implies that the radial wave function $\\psi(r) = u(r)/r$ is finite at $r=0$. This requires $u(0)=0$, so we must have $B=0$. Thus, the solution in the inner region is:\n$$ u_(r) = Ar $$\n\n**Region 2: $r  R$**\nIn this region, $V(r)=0$ as well. The TISE is again:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u_(r)}{dr^2} = 0 $$\nThe general solution is $u_(r) = Cr + D$.\nThis solution must match the asymptotic form defining the scattering length, $u(r) \\propto (r-a_s)$. By comparing the two forms, we can identify $C$ as the proportionality constant and $D = -C a_s$. So, the solution in the outer region is:\n$$ u_(r) = C(r-a_s) $$\n\n**Boundary Conditions at $r=R$**\nWe must apply two boundary conditions at $r=R$:\n1. The wave function $u(r)$ must be continuous:\n$$ u_(R) = u_(R) $$\n$$ AR = C(R-a_s) $$\n\n2. The derivative of the wave function $u'(r)$ has a discontinuity determined by the delta-function potential.

Substituting these and $u(R) = u_(R) = AR$ into the jump condition gives:\n$$ C - A = -\\frac{2mV_0}{\\hbar^2} (AR) $$\n\n**Solving for the Scattering Length $a_s$**\nWe now have a system of two equations with three unknowns ($A, C, a_s$).
