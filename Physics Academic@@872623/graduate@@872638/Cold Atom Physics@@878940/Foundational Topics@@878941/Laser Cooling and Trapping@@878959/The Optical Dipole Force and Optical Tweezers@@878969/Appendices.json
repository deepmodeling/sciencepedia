In the Rayleigh regime, where the particle's radius $a$ is much smaller than the laser wavelength $\\lambda$, a dielectric sphere can be modeled as an ideal point dipole. The dominant force responsible for stable trapping at the beam's focus is the gradient force, which pulls the particle towards the region of highest light intensity.\n\nConsider a dielectric sphere of radius $a$ and refractive index $n_p$ suspended in a medium of refractive index $n_m$. The sphere is illuminated by a fundamental Gaussian laser beam (TEM$_{00}$) of total power $P$ and wavelength $\\lambda$, which is focused to a beam waist radius of $w_0$.\n\nThe following physical relationships are provided:\n1.
