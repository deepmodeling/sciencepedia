Before diving into the complex dynamics of growth, it's essential to understand the underlying conservation laws that govern this energy exchange. The Manley-Rowe relations provide just such a framework, expressing the conservation of wave action, which you can think of as the number of 'quanta' in each wave mode. This first exercise [@problem_id:295800] provides a direct application of this powerful principle to determine the partitioning of energy between the two daughter waves in a parametric decay.", "problem": "In a homogeneous, unmagnetized plasma, a high-frequency pump wave with frequency $\\omega_0$ and wavevector $\\mathbf{k}_0$ can parametrically decay into two daughter waves: a Langmuir wave with frequency $\\omega_1$ and wavevector $\\mathbf{k}_1$, and an ion-acoustic wave with frequency $\\omega_2$ and wavevector $\\mathbf{k}_2$. For this three-wave resonant interaction to occur, the frequencies and wavevectors must satisfy the matching conditions: $\\omega_0 = \\omega_1 + \\omega_2$ and $\\mathbf{k}_0 = \\mathbf{k}_1 + \\mathbf{k}_2$.\n\nThe flow of energy between these waves in a lossless medium is governed by the Manley-Rowe relations. These relations are a consequence of the conservation of wave action. The action density, $\\mathcal{A}_j$, of a wave mode $j$ is defined as the ratio of its energy density $U_j$ to its frequency $\\omega_j$, i.e., $\\mathcal{A}_j = U_j / \\omega_j$. For the parametric decay process described, the Manley-Rowe relations imply that for every quantum of the pump wave that is annihilated, one quantum of the Langmuir wave and one quantum of the ion-acoustic wave are created. This means the rate of change of the action density is the same for both daughter waves.\n\nAssuming the two daughter waves grow from negligible initial energy densities, derive the ratio of the energy density of the daughter Langmuir wave, $U_1$, to the energy density of the daughter ion-acoustic wave, $U_2$.
