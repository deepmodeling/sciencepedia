The plasma response can be described by the linearized Vlasov equation for the first-order perturbation $f^{(1)}$ and the second-order Vlasov equation for $f^{(2)}$.\n2.  The source term for the second-order perturbation $f^{(2)}$ is dominated by the interaction of the second external field with the first-order perturbation $f^{(1)}$. Specifically, the relevant term in the Vlasov equation is $\\frac{\\partial f^{(2)}}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial f^{(2)}}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{q E_2}{m} \\frac{\\partial f^{(1)}}{\\partial v}$.\n3.  In calculating the derivative $\\frac{\\partial f^{(1)}}{\\partial v}$, assume that the dominant contribution comes from differentiating the rapidly oscillating phase terms. Contributions from differentiating slowly varying amplitude factors of $v$ may be neglected (the \"high-velocity\" or \"rapid-phase\" approximation).", "solution": "1. **First-order perturbation**: The first pulse is applied over the duration $0 \\le t' \\le T_1$. We can treat it as a continuous sequence of infinitesimal pulses. A single such pulse at time $t'$ creates a first-order perturbation in the distribution function, $f^{(1)}$. By the time of the second pulse at $t=\\tau$, this perturbation, having evolved via free-streaming, has the form:\n   $$f^{(1)}(z,v,\\tau) \\propto \\phi_1 \\cos(k_1(z - v(\\tau-t'))) \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial v}$$\n   The rapid phase variation is in the cosine term.\n\n2. **Second-order perturbation source**: At $t=\\tau$, the second pulse, $E_2(z,t)$, interacts with the accumulated first-order perturbation. The source term for the second-order perturbation, $f^{(2)}$, is given by $S^{(2)} = -\\frac{qE_2}{m} \\frac{\\partial f^{(1)}}{\\partial v}$. Using the rapid-phase approximation, we differentiate the argument of the cosine in $f^{(1)}$ with respect to $v$:\n   $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} \\cos(k_1(z - v(\\tau-t'))) = k_1(\\tau-t') \\sin(k_1(z - v(\\tau-t')))$$\n   The resulting source term is therefore proportional to the \"age\" of the first-order perturbation, $(\\tau-t')$. This is the key factor that determines the echo's temporal profile.\n\n3. **Rephasing and Echo Formation**: The second-order perturbation $f^{(2)}$ created at $t=\\tau$ then free-streams. The echo at wavenumber $k_e = k_2 - k_1$ forms when the velocity-dependent phase contributions from different particle paths cancel out. A full phase analysis shows that for a component of the first pulse applied at time $t'$, the echo forms at a later time $t$ given by the rephasing condition:\n   $$t(k_2-k_1) = k_2\\tau - k_1t' \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad t = \\frac{k_2\\tau - k_1t'}{k_2-k_1}$$\n   This shows that the echo is not a single event but is \"smeared out\" in time, as each initial time $t' \\in [0, T_1]$ maps to a different echo time $t$.\n\n4. **Temporal Profile of the Echo**: Since the amplitude of the contribution from each $t'$ is proportional to $(\\tau-t')$, we can find the amplitudes at the temporal boundaries of the echo signal.\n   - The **later echo** corresponds to the earliest part of the first pulse, i.e., $t'=0$.
