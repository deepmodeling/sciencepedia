In this model, the Earth is a perfect sphere of radius $R_E$, and its magnetic field is generated by a magnetic dipole of moment $\\vec{M}$. The dipole is displaced from the Earth's geocenter by a constant vector $\\vec{d}$.\n\nThe minimum magnetic field intensity on the Earth's surface occurs at a point we designate as $P_S$. The magnitude of the magnetic field at this point is $B_S$. Now, consider the specific magnetic field line that passes through $P_S$. We trace this field line out to the magnetic equator (the plane perpendicular to the dipole moment $\\vec{M}$ that contains the dipole). The point where this field line intersects the magnetic equator is $P_{eq}$, and the magnetic field magnitude at this point is $B_{eq}$. It is given that $B_S  B_{eq}$.\n\nA non-relativistic proton is trapped on this particular magnetic field line. Its motion is governed by the Lorentz force, and it undergoes bouncing motion between two mirror points.

At this point, the particle's velocity is purely perpendicular to the magnetic field, i.e., $v = v_{\\perp}$.\nThis means that the pitch angle at the mirror point, $\\alpha_S$, must be $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n$$\n\\alpha_S = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\nTherefore, the sine of the pitch angle at the mirror point is:\n$$\n\\sin(\\alpha_S) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting this result into our conservation equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sin^2(\\alpha_{eq})}{B_{eq}} = \\frac{1^2}{B_S} = \\frac{1}{B_S}\n$$\nNow, we can solve for $\\sin(\\alpha_{eq})$.
