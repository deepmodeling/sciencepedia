This exercise grounds our study in this fundamental metric by tasking you with its derivation for a Hall thruster, a widely used type of electric propulsion. You will apply principles of energy and momentum conservation to determine how real-world effects, such as incomplete propellant ionization and the presence of multiple ion charge states, influence the thruster's ultimate performance [@problem_id:300720].", "problem": "In a simplified model of a Hall thruster, a neutral propellant gas is continuously fed into an annular acceleration channel. Inside the channel, a fraction of the propellant atoms is ionized. These ions are then accelerated by an axial electric field, produced by a potential drop $\\Delta V$ between the anode (at the back of the channel) and the cathode (downstream of the exit plane).\n\nConsider a thruster operating with a propellant whose atoms have a mass $M$. The ionization process is imperfect in two ways. First, not all propellant atoms are ionized. The propellant utilization efficiency, $\\eta_m$, is defined as the fraction of the total incoming propellant mass that becomes ionized. Second, the ionization can produce both singly-charged ions (charge $+e$) and doubly-charged ions (charge $+2e$). Let $\\alpha$ be the fraction of the *ionized particle number density* that is doubly-charged, with the remaining fraction $(1-\\alpha)$ being singly-charged.\n\nAssume that all ions, regardless of their charge state, are created at rest and are accelerated through the same potential drop $\\Delta V$. Neglect the mass of the electrons compared to the mass of an atom, so both singly and doubly-charged ions can be considered to have mass $M$. The total mass flow rate of the neutral propellant into the thruster is $\\dot{m}$.

A critical challenge for these systems is ensuring that the ion stream can detach from the diverging magnetic field lines to produce net thrust. This practice explores the physics of this detachment process by analyzing the condition under which an ion's motion ceases to be 'adiabatic' or tied to the field line [@problem_id:300887]. By comparing the ion's gyroperiod to its transit time across the field gradient, you will derive a physical criterion for successful thrust generation.", "problem": "In plasma propulsion, a magnetic nozzle is a configuration of magnetic fields used to guide and accelerate a plasma, converting its thermal energy into directed kinetic energy to generate thrust. A key process for efficient thrust generation is the detachment of ions from the magnetic field lines as they exit the nozzle. If the ions remain magnetized, they are turned back by the diverging field lines, resulting in little or no net thrust.\n\nA criterion for ion demagnetization can be established by comparing the characteristic timescales of the ion's motion. The guiding-center approximation, which assumes ions spiral tightly around magnetic field lines, breaks down when the magnetic field changes significantly over the course of a single gyro-orbit. This transition to non-adiabatic motion facilitates detachment.\n\nConsider a singly-charged ion of mass $m_i$ and charge $e$ ejected from a thruster. It travels with a constant axial velocity $v_z$ along the axis of a magnetic nozzle.
