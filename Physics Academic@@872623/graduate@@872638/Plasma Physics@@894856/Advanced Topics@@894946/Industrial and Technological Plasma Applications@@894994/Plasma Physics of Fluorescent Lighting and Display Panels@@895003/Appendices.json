This process hinges on the radiative decay of excited atoms, but this is not the only de-excitation pathway available. This exercise explores the critical concept of collisional quenching, where excited atoms lose their energy non-radiatively through collisions with other particles, such as impurity water molecules, reducing the lamp's light output and efficiency. By modeling this competition between radiative decay and quenching, you will develop a quantitative understanding of how plasma purity impacts device performance [@problem_id:308585].", "problem": "In a low-pressure mercury-vapor discharge, such as those found in fluorescent lamps, electron collisions excite ground-state mercury atoms ($Hg$) to the $6^3P_1$ resonance state. The de-excitation of this state is responsible for the emission of ultraviolet radiation that ultimately generates visible light. This de-excitation process is governed by a competition between radiative decay and non-radiative collisional quenching.\n\nConsider a model for such a discharge with the following processes:\n1.  **Production:** Ground-state mercury atoms are excited to the $6^3P_1$ state at a constant rate per unit volume, $P$.\n2.  **Radiative Decay:** An excited atom returns to the ground state by emitting a photon. This process is characterized by a natural radiative lifetime $\\tau_{rad}$.\n3.  **Self-Quenching:** An excited atom collides with a ground-state mercury atom and de-excites non-radiatively. This process is described by a rate coefficient $k_{Hg}$ and the number density of ground-state mercury atoms, $N_{Hg}$.\n4.  **Impurity Quenching:** An excited atom collides with a water vapor molecule ($H_2O$) and de-excites non-radiatively. Water vapor is present as an impurity with partial pressure $p_{H_2O}$. The rate coefficient for this process is $k_q$.\n\nLet $I$ be the steady-state intensity of the resonance line emission when water vapor is present, and let $I_0$ be the intensity in an ideal, impurity-free discharge (i.e., one containing only mercury vapor). The intensity of the line is directly proportional to the rate of radiative decay.\n\nAssuming the gas mixture is at a constant, uniform temperature $T$ and behaves as an ideal gas, derive a symbolic expression for the relative intensity, $\\eta = I/I_0$, as a function of the given system parameters.", "solution": "1.

Consider a long cylindrical plasma positive column of radius $R$. A particular radical species is generated uniformly throughout the plasma volume at a constant rate $P_0$ (number of particles per unit volume per unit time).\n\nThe radicals are lost by diffusing to the wall and recombining on the surface. The transport of these neutral radicals towards the wall is governed by Fick's law of diffusion, with a constant diffusion coefficient $D$. At the wall ($r=R$), the radicals are lost due to surface recombination. This process is characterized by a recombination probability $\\beta$, which is the fraction of incident particles that are lost upon collision with the wall. The random flux of particles incident on any surface is given by $\\frac{1}{4} n v_{th}$, where $n$ is the particle number density at the surface and $v_{th}$ is their mean thermal velocity. Therefore, the recombination flux at the wall is $\\Gamma_{recomb} = \\beta \\frac{1}{4}n(R)v_{th}$. In steady state, this loss flux must be balanced by the diffusive flux arriving at the wall.\n\nThe effective particle loss frequency, $\\nu_{loss}$, is a key parameter that characterizes the overall loss rate.
