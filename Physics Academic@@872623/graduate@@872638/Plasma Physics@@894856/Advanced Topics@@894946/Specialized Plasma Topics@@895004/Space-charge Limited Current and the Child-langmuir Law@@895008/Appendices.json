The plates have a large cross-sectional area $A$. This diode is connected in series with a DC voltage source of a fixed voltage $V_S$ and a load resistor of resistance $R$.\n\nThe cathode is held at zero potential and emits electrons with zero initial velocity. The current flow in the diode is space-charge limited, meaning that the buildup of electron charge in the gap between the plates is sufficient to suppress the electric field at the cathode surface to zero. Under these conditions, the steady-state current density $J$ is described by the Child-Langmuir law:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{4\\epsilon_0}{9} \\sqrt{\\frac{2e}{m_e}} \\frac{V_D^{3/2}}{d^2}\n$$\nwhere $V_D$ is the voltage drop across the diode (anode potential relative to the cathode), $e$ is the elementary charge, $m_e$ is the electron mass, and $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.\n\nThe resistance $R$ of the load resistor is adjustable.

The relationship between the current density $J$ and the total current $I$ is $I = J A$. The Child-Langmuir law can be written in terms of the total current $I$:\n$$\nI = A \\left( \\frac{4\\epsilon_0}{9 d^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2e}{m_e}} \\right) V_D^{3/2}\n$$\nLet's define a constant $K$ that encapsulates the geometric and physical properties of the diode:\n$$\nK = A \\frac{4\\epsilon_0}{9 d^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2e}{m_e}}\n$$\nSo, the current-voltage relationship for the diode is:\n$$\nI = K V_D^{3/2}\n$$\nIn the series circuit, the source voltage $V_S$ is distributed across the diode and the resistor. According to Kirchhoff's voltage law:\n$$\nV_S = V_D + V_R\n$$\nwhere $V_R$ is the voltage drop across the resistor. By Ohm's law, $V_R = I R$. Thus, the circuit equation is:\n$$\nV_S = V_D + I R\n$$\nThe power dissipated in the load resistor, $P_R$, is given by:\n$$\nP_R = I^2 R\n$$\nOur goal is to maximize $P_R$. The resistance $R$ is the adjustable parameter. As $R$ is varied, both $I$ and $V_D$ change their values. It is convenient to express $P_R$ as a function of a single variable, for instance $V_D$.\n\nFrom the circuit equation, we can express the resistance $R$ in terms of $I$, $V_S$, and $V_D$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{V_S - V_D}{I}\n$$\nSubstitute this expression for $R$ into the power equation:\n$$\nP_R = I^2 \\left( \\frac{V_S - V_D}{I} \\right) = I (V_S - V_D)\n$$\nNow, substitute the diode's current-voltage relationship, $I = K V_D^{3/2}$, into the expression for $P_R$. This gives the power as a function of the diode voltage $V_D$ only:\n$$\nP_R(V_D) = (K V_D^{3/2}) (V_S - V_D) = K (V_S V_D^{3/2} - V_D^{5/2})\n$$\nThe physically meaningful range for the diode voltage $V_D$ is from $0$ (when $R \\to \\infty$ and $I \\to 0$) to $V_S$ (when $R \\to 0$). At both endpoints, $P_R(0)=0$ and $P_R(V_S)=0$. The maximum power must occur at a critical point within the interval $(0, V_S)$.\n\nTo find the value of $V_D$ that maximizes $P_R$, we take the derivative of $P_R(V_D)$ with respect to $V_D$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_R}{dV_D} = \\frac{d}{dV_D} \\left[ K (V_S V_D^{3/2} - V_D^{5/2}) \\right] = 0\n$$\nSince $K$ is a non-zero constant, we can divide by it:\n$$\nV_S \\cdot \\frac{d}{dV_D}(V_D^{3/2}) - \\frac{d}{dV_D}(V_D^{5/2}) = 0\n$$\n$$\nV_S \\left(\\frac{3}{2} V_D^{1/2}\\right) - \\frac{5}{2} V_D^{3/2} = 0\n$$\nWe can factor out $\\frac{1}{2} V_D^{1/2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} V_D^{1/2} (3 V_S - 5 V_D) = 0\n$$\nThis equation has two solutions: $V_D = 0$ and $3 V_S - 5 V_D = 0$.
