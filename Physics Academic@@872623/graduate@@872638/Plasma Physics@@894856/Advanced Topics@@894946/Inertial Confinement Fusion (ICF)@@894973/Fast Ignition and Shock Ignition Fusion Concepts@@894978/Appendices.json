Consider a simplified one-dimensional model where a planar, strong shock propagates through a cold, stationary plasma. In the high-density regime relevant to the compressed fuel core, the pressure is dominated by the non-relativistic, degenerate electron gas. The plasma can thus be modeled as a fluid with an equation of state given by $P = K \\rho^\\gamma$, where $P$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the mass density, $K$ is a constant, and the polytropic index is $\\gamma = 5/3$.\n\nInitially, the plasma is in a uniform state (region 0) with pressure $P_0$ and density $\\rho_0$. A strong shock propagates with velocity $U_s$ into this medium, creating a post-shock region (region 1) characterized by pressure $P_1$, density $\\rho_1$, and fluid velocity $u_1$. The strong shock condition implies $P_1 \\gg P_0$.\n\nThis shock front then strikes a stationary, perfectly rigid wall, causing the shock to reflect.

Reflected Shock (Region 1 → 2):**\nThe shock reflects from the rigid wall. This creates a new region (region 2) which is stationary ($u_2=0$). The reflected shock propagates back through region 1. It is easiest to analyze this by transforming to a reference frame moving with the fluid in region 1. In this frame, the wall approaches at velocity $u_1$, and the problem is equivalent to a piston moving at speed $u_1$ into a stationary gas with properties ($P_1, \\rho_1$). The shock driven by this piston must move at some velocity $V_r$ (relative to the gas in region 1) and will bring the fluid behind it to velocity $u_1$ to match the piston (wall) speed.\n\nThe velocity of the fluid behind this new shock (in region 1's frame) is $u_{piston} = u_1$. For a strong shock moving at speed $V_r$, this velocity is given by the R-H relation: $u_1 = \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}V_r$. The pressure jump across this reflected shock is $P_2 - P_1 = \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\rho_1 V_r^2$.\nWe can express $V_r$ in terms of $u_1$: $V_r = \\frac{\\gamma+1}{2}u_1$.
