A simplified one-dimensional, steady-state model of the plasma flow provides valuable insights. The flow is governed by the conservation of mass and momentum fluxes.\n\nConsider the subsonic conduction zone of a laser-ablated plasma, a region of dense, hot plasma expanding from a target surface. The flow in this zone is governed by the following principles:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Mass Flux**: The mass flux $\\dot{m} = \\rho v$ is constant, where $\\rho$ is the plasma mass density and $v$ is the fluid velocity.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum Flux**: The total pressure, which is the sum of the thermal pressure $P$ and the ram pressure $\\rho v^2$, is constant. This can be expressed as $P + \\rho v^2 = P_{stag}$, where $P_{stag}$ is a constant representing the stagnation pressure.\n\nThe plasma is composed of ions of mass $m_i$ and charge state $Z$, and electrons.

Consider a simple model for this process. A laser is incident on a plasma that is characterized by an initial, unperturbed linear electron density profile $n_0(x) = n_q(1 + x/L)$, where $n_q$ is the quarter-critical density, $x$ is the spatial coordinate along the density gradient, and $L$ is the density gradient scale length.\n\nThe TPD instability generates a packet of Langmuir waves localized around the $x=0$ surface.
