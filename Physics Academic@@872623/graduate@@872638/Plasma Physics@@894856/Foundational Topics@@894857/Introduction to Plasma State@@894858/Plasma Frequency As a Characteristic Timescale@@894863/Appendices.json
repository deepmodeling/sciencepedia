However, since a neutral plasma consists of at least two species of charged particles (electrons and ions), it's crucial to understand which species sets the characteristic response time. This first exercise establishes the foundational concept that the plasma frequency is strongly dependent on the oscillating particle's mass. By calculating the ratio of the electron to proton plasma frequencies, you will quantify the vast difference in their response timescales, providing the justification for why high-frequency plasma phenomena are almost entirely governed by the much more mobile electrons [@problem_id:1597195].", "problem": "The interstellar medium (ISM) in many regions of our galaxy can be modeled as a cold, tenuous, and fully ionized hydrogen plasma.
