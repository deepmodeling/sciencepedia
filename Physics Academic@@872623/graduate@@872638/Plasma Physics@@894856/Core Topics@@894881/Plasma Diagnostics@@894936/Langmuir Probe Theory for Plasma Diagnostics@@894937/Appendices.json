The electrode is held at a potential $-V_p$ relative to the bulk plasma potential, which is defined as zero at the plasma-sheath boundary.\n\nThe plasma consists of singly charged positive ions (mass $m_i$, charge $e$) and thermalized electrons. A constant ion current density, $j_i$, flows from the plasma, across the sheath, and to the electrode. Within the sheath, ions experience a drag force due to collisions with a stationary background neutral gas. This collisional interaction is characterized by a constant ion-neutral collision frequency, $\\nu_{in}$.\n\nWe analyze the system in the **highly collisional (mobility-limited) limit**. In this regime, the ion flow is dominated by the balance between the electric field and the collisional drag. Specifically, the ion inertia term in the ion fluid momentum equation is assumed to be negligible compared to the electric force and the drag force.\n\nUsing this mobility-limited fluid model, derive an expression for the total power dissipated per unit area, $P_{coll}$, by the ion-neutral collisions within the entire sheath.
