The rovibrational energy levels $E(v, J)$ of a diatomic molecule in a specific electronic state can be modeled by the expression:\n$$\nE(v, J) = G(v) + F_v(J)\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the vibrational quantum number and $J$ is the rotational quantum number. $G(v)$ represents the purely vibrational energy. The rotational energy term, $F_v(J)$, for a non-rigid rotator is given by:\n$$\nF_v(J) = B_v J(J+1) - D_v J^2(J+1)^2\n$$\nHere, $B_v$ is the rotational constant and $D_v$ is the first-order centrifugal distortion constant for the vibrational state $v$.\n\nAn absorption experiment is performed on a plasma containing a particular diatomic species. The frequencies, $\\nu$, of the transitions corresponding to the R-branch ($J' = J+1$) of a specific vibrational band ($v'' \\to v'$) are measured. Upon analysis, it is found that these transition frequencies can be accurately described by a cubic polynomial in the index $m = J+1$, where $J$ is the rotational quantum number of the initial (lower) state:\n$$\n\\nu(m) = K_0 + K_1 m + K_2 m^2 + K_3 m^3\n$$\nThe empirical coefficients $K_0, K_1, K_2, K_3$ are determined from a fit to the experimental data. The fact that a cubic polynomial, rather than a quartic, provides an excellent fit implies a specific relationship between the centrifugal distortion constants of the upper ($v'$) and lower ($v''$) states. You may assume this implicit relationship holds exactly.\n\nUsing this information, derive an expression for the rotational constant of the excited vibrational state, $B_{v'}$, in terms of Planck's constant $h$ and the empirically determined coefficients $K_1$ and $K_2$.", "solution": "We start from the rovibrational levels:\n$$E(v,J)=G(v)+F_v(J),\\qquad F_v(J)=B_v\\,J(J+1)-D_v\\,J^2(J+1)^2$$  \nFor the R‐branch transition $J\\to J+1$, we define $m=J+1$. The transition frequency $\\nu(m)$ is related to the energy difference by $h\\nu(m)=E(v',m)-E(v'',m-1)$. Let's use the shorthand $B'$ for $B_{v'}$, $D'$ for $D_{v'}$, etc. The energy difference is:\n$$h\\nu(m) = [G(v')-G(v'')] + [F_{v'}(m)-F_{v''}(m-1)]$$\n$$h\\nu(m) = \\Delta G + [B'm(m+1)-D'm^2(m+1)^2] - [B''(m-1)m-D''(m-1)^2m^2]$$\nCollecting powers of $m$ in the expression for $h\\nu(m)$ gives a fourth‐order polynomial. The coefficient of the $m^4$ term is $D''-D'$. Since the empirical fit for $\\nu(m)$ is only cubic, this coefficient must be zero, which implies:\n$$D'=D''$$  \nUnder this condition, we compare the coefficients of our theoretical expression for $h\\nu(m)$ to the empirical model $h\\nu(m) = h(K_0+K_1m+K_2m^2+K_3m^3)$.
