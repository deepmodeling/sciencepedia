Consider a simplified model of this system, where a long, initially uniform plasma column of radius $r_0$ and constant mass density $\\rho_0$ is present at time $t=0$. This plasma contains an initially uniform, \"frozen-in\" axial magnetic field of magnitude $B_{z0}$.\n\nAt $t=0$, a large current $I(t)$ begins to flow in a single-turn conducting coil of length $L_c$ and radius $r_c$ (where $r_c > r_0$), which is coaxial with the plasma. This current generates a time-varying external axial magnetic field $B_{ext}(t)$ in the vacuum region between the coil and the plasma. For this idealized coil, the external field is related to the current by $B_{ext}(t) = \\mu_0 I(t) / L_c$.\n\nThe external field drives a thin, perfectly conducting plasma sheath radially inward. The objective is to drive the implosion such that the sheath maintains a constant inward velocity $v_p$. The radius of the sheath at time $t$ is therefore given by $r_p(t) = r_0 - v_p t$.\n\nAssume the following:\n1.  The implosion dynamics are described by the snowplow model, where the inward-moving sheath sweeps up all the stationary plasma it encounters.\n2.  The magnetic flux from the initial field $B_{z0}$ is conserved (trapped) within the imploding plasma sheath.\n3.
