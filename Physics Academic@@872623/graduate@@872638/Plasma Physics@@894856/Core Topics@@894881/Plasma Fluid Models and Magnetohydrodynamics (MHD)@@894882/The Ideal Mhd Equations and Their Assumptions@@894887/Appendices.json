Two fundamental principles in this regime are the conservation of mass and the frozen-in flux theorem.

Throughout this process, the magnetic field remains uniform in space (but changes in time) and directed purely along the $z$-axis, i.e., $\\mathbf{B}(t) = B(t) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The density $\\rho(t)$ also remains uniform within the element.\n\nThe relationship between the magnetic field strength and the density during this compression can be expressed as a power law:\n$$\nB(t) = C \\, [\\rho(t)]^\\alpha\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant determined by the initial conditions, and $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless exponent.\n\nUsing the principles of mass conservation and the frozen-in flux theorem for the described plasma element, derive the value of the exponent $\\alpha$.", "solution": "Using mass conservation for the plasma element, we have\n$$\n\\rho_0\\,L_{x0}L_{y0}L_{z} \\;=\\;\\rho(t)\\,L_x(t)L_y(t)L_{z}\\,.\n$$\nSince $L_z$ is constant, this simplifies to\n$$\n\\rho_0\\,L_{x0}L_{y0} \\;=\\;\\rho(t)\\,L_x(t)L_y(t)\n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n\\frac{L_{x0}L_{y0}}{L_x(t)L_y(t)} \n=\\frac{\\rho(t)}{\\rho_0}\\,.\n$$\n\nFrom the frozen-in flux theorem, the magnetic flux through the $x$–$y$ face is conserved:\n$$\nB_0\\,L_{x0}L_{y0} \\;=\\; B(t)\\,L_x(t)L_y(t)\n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n\\frac{L_{x0}L_{y0}}{L_x(t)L_y(t)} \n=\\frac{B(t)}{B_0}\\,.\n$$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $L_{x0}L_{y0}/[L_x(t)L_y(t)]$ gives\n$$\n\\frac{B(t)}{B_0} \\;=\\;\\frac{\\rho(t)}{\\rho_0}\n\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\nB(t)=B_0\\,\\frac{\\rho(t)}{\\rho_0}\n\\;=\\;\\bigl(B_0/\\rho_0\\bigr)\\,\\rho(t)\\,.\n$$\n\nComparing with $B(t)=C\\,[\\rho(t)]^\\alpha$ shows $\\alpha=1\\,$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "343653"}, {"introduction": "Ideal MHD supports several types of waves, with the Alfvén wave being the most iconic, representing the propagation of transverse magnetic field perturbations along field lines.
