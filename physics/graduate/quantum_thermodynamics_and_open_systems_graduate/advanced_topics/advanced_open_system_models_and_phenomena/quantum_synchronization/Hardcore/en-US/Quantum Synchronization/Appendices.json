            "problem": "Consider two weakly nonlinear quantum limit-cycle oscillators coupled through a Markovian bath. Each oscillator is described by lowering operator $a_{j}$ and bare Hamiltonian $H_{j} = \\hbar \\omega_{j} a_{j}^{\\dagger} a_{j}$ for $j \\in \\{1,2\\}$, and the interaction with the environment is such that it sustains self-oscillation while inducing phase diffusion. The oscillators are weakly and near-resonantly coupled with strength $K$ through a dissipative channel that favors phase alignment, and they are subject to quantum noise produced by the bath. In the rotating frame at the mean frequency, and within the secular and rotating-wave approximations consistent with the Born–Markov limit for open quantum systems, the reduced dynamics of the relative phase $\\phi$ between the oscillators is known to admit a phase-only description. In this regime, the probability density $P(\\phi,t)$ for the phase difference obeys a one-dimensional Fokker–Planck equation (FPE) on the circle with periodic boundary conditions. Specifically, the long-time phase dynamics is governed by\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P(\\phi,t)}{\\partial t} \\;=\\; -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} \\big[ f(\\phi)\\, P(\\phi,t) \\big] \\;+\\; D \\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} P(\\phi,t)}{\\partial \\phi^{2}} \\,,\n$$\nwhere $f(\\phi)$ is the deterministic drift arising from detuning and coupling, $D>0$ is the phase diffusion coefficient induced by quantum noise, and the detuning is $\\Delta \\omega \\equiv \\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2}$. You may assume that near resonance and for weak coupling the drift takes the standard Adler form $f(\\phi) = \\Delta \\omega - K \\sin(\\phi)$, which is the leading-order result of phase reduction for coupled limit-cycle oscillators under dissipative coupling in open quantum systems. The stationary solutions $P_{s}(\\phi)$ satisfy\n$$\n-\\frac{d}{d\\phi}\\big[f(\\phi) P_{s}(\\phi)\\big] + D \\frac{d^{2}P_{s}(\\phi)}{d\\phi^{2}} = 0 \\,,\n$$\nwith $P_{s}(\\phi+2\\pi)=P_{s}(\\phi)$.\n\nDefine synchronization in the sense of phase locking: the relative phase is stochastically confined around a stable value with vanishing long-time average frequency, corresponding to a stationary solution with zero stationary current on the circle in the weak-noise limit. By analyzing the stationary Fokker–Planck equation and its weak-noise asymptotics, derive the critical detuning $\\Delta \\omega_{c}$ (as a function of the coupling $K$) beyond which phase locking is lost, i.e., the stationary distribution cannot form a normalizable, zero-current solution concentrated near a stable phase.\n\nYour final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression for $\\Delta \\omega_{c}$ in terms of $K$. No numerical approximation is required. Express the answer as a symbolic expression without units.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the critical detuning $\\Delta\\omega_c$ beyond which phase locking is lost for two coupled quantum oscillators. The dynamics of the relative phase $\\phi$ are described by the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P(\\phi,t)}{\\partial t} \\;=\\; -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} \\big[ f(\\phi)\\, P(\\phi,t) \\big] \\;+\\; D \\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} P(\\phi,t)}{\\partial \\phi^{2}}\n$$\nwhere the drift term is given by the Adler form $f(\\phi) = \\Delta \\omega - K \\sin(\\phi)$, and $D > 0$ is the phase diffusion coefficient.\n\nPhase locking is defined as the stochastic confinement of the relative phase around a stable value. This corresponds to a stationary probability distribution $P_s(\\phi)$ that is localized, which occurs in the weak-noise limit ($D \\to 0$). In this limit, the behavior of the system is dominated by the deterministic part of the dynamics, which is described by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = f(\\phi) = \\Delta \\omega - K \\sin(\\phi)\n$$\nThe noise term $D \\frac{\\partial^{2} P}{\\partial \\phi^{2}}$ causes the phase to fluctuate around the stable attractors of this deterministic equation. A phase-locked state exists if and only if the deterministic dynamics possess at least one stable fixed point. The loss of phase locking corresponds to the disappearance of these stable fixed points through a bifurcation.\n\nA fixed point, denoted by $\\phi^*$, is a solution to $\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = 0$. We set $f(\\phi^*) = 0$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\omega - K \\sin(\\phi^*) = 0\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\sin(\\phi^*) = \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{K}\n$$\nFor real solutions for $\\phi^*$ to exist, the value of the sine function must be within the range $[-1, 1]$. This imposes the following condition on the parameters $\\Delta \\omega$ and $K$:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{K} \\right| \\le 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad |\\Delta \\omega| \\le |K|\n$$\nIf this condition is not met, i.e., if $|\\Delta \\omega| > |K|$, there are no fixed points, and the phase undergoes continuous drift (phase slipping). This corresponds to the unlocked state.\n\nTo determine the stability of the fixed points when they do exist ($|\\Delta \\omega| \\le |K|$), we perform a linear stability analysis. We examine the sign of the derivative of the drift term, $f'(\\phi) = \\frac{df}{d\\phi}$, evaluated at the fixed point $\\phi^*$. A fixed point is stable if $f'(\\phi^*)  0$.\nThe derivative of $f(\\phi)$ is:\n$$\nf'(\\phi) = -K \\cos(\\phi)\n$$\nFor stability, we require:\n$$\nf'(\\phi^*) = -K \\cos(\\phi^*)  0\n$$\nThe problem states that the coupling \"favors phase alignment\". For zero detuning ($\\Delta\\omega=0$), the fixed points are $\\phi^*=0$ and $\\phi^*=\\pi$. The drift term becomes $f(\\phi)=-K\\sin(\\phi)$. The stable fixed point, responsible for alignment, should be $\\phi^*=0$. The stability condition at this point is $-K\\cos(0) = -K  0$, which implies $K>0$. Thus, a positive coupling strength $K>0$ is consistent with the problem description.\n\nWith $K>0$, the stability condition becomes $\\cos(\\phi^*) > 0$.\nFrom the fixed-point condition $\\sin(\\phi^*) = \\Delta \\omega/K$, we find $\\cos(\\phi^*)$ using the identity $\\cos^2(\\phi^*) + \\sin^2(\\phi^*) = 1$:\n$$\n\\cos(\\phi^*) = \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2(\\phi^*)} = \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{K}\\right)^2}\n$$\nFor a stable fixed point to exist, we need to find a solution $\\phi^*$ that satisfies both $\\sin(\\phi^*) = \\Delta \\omega/K$ and $\\cos(\\phi^*) > 0$.\nIf $|\\Delta \\omega|  K$, there are two distinct solutions for $\\phi^*$ in any interval of length $2\\pi$. One of these solutions will have $\\cos(\\phi^*) = +\\sqrt{1 - (\\Delta\\omega/K)^2} > 0$, corresponding to a stable fixed point. The other will have $\\cos(\\phi^*) = -\\sqrt{1 - (\\Delta\\omega/K)^2}  0$, corresponding to an unstable fixed point. Therefore, for $|\\Delta \\omega|  K$, a stable phase-locked state exists.\n\nThe transition to the unlocked state occurs when the stable and unstable fixed points merge and annihilate. This happens at the boundary of the existence condition, $|\\Delta \\omega| = K$. At this point:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{K} \\right| = 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\sin(\\phi^*) = \\pm 1\n$$\nThis implies that $\\phi^*$ is an odd multiple of $\\pi/2$. For these values, $\\cos(\\phi^*) = 0$. Consequently, $f'(\\phi^*) = -K \\cos(\\phi^*) = 0$. This indicates a saddle-node bifurcation, where the fixed point is marginally stable and is about to disappear.\n\nFor any detuning $|\\Delta \\omega|$ greater than this value, no fixed points exist, and phase locking is impossible. The critical detuning $\\Delta \\omega_c$ is defined as the maximum value of $|\\Delta \\omega|$ for which a phase-locked state can be maintained. This corresponds to the bifurcation point.\n$$\n\\Delta \\omega_c = K\n$$\nBeyond this critical detuning, i.e., for $|\\Delta \\omega| > K$, the system is in a phase-slipping regime, and phase locking is lost.\n\nThis can also be understood by analyzing the potential $U(\\phi)$ associated with the drift $f(\\phi)$, where $f(\\phi) = -\\frac{dU}{d\\phi}$.\n$$\nU(\\phi) = -\\int f(\\phi) d\\phi = -\\int (\\Delta \\omega - K \\sin(\\phi)) d\\phi = -\\Delta\\omega \\phi - K \\cos(\\phi)\n$$\nThis is a \"tilted washboard\" potential. The stable fixed points of the dynamics correspond to the local minima of this potential. The condition for an extremum is $U'(\\phi) = -f(\\phi) = 0$, which is the same fixed-point condition as before. The condition for a local minimum is $U''(\\phi) > 0$. Since $U''(\\phi) = K \\cos(\\phi)$, this requires $K \\cos(\\phi) > 0$, which again implies $\\cos(\\phi) > 0$ for $K>0$. Local minima exist as long as $|\\Delta \\omega|  K$. When $|\\Delta \\omega| > K$, the tilt $-\\Delta\\omega \\phi$ dominates the periodic part $-K \\cos(\\phi)$, the potential has no local minima, and the phase \"particle\" slides down the potential, corresponding to phase slipping. The transition occurs at $|\\Delta \\omega|=K$, where the local minima flatten out into inflection points. Thus, the critical detuning is $\\Delta \\omega_c = K$.",
