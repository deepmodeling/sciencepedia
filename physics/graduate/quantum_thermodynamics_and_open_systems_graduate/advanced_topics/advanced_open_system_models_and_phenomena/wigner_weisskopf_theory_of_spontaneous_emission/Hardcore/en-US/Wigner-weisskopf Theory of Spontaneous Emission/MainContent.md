## Introduction
Spontaneous emission—the process by which an excited atom decays by releasing a photon into the vacuum—is a fundamental yet non-trivial phenomenon in quantum mechanics. While a full description requires the machinery of [quantum electrodynamics](@entry_id:154201), the Wigner-Weisskopf theory offers a powerful and physically intuitive approach that captures the essential physics of this irreversible process. This article addresses the apparent paradox of how unitary [quantum evolution](@entry_id:198246) gives rise to exponential decay, providing a bridge from microscopic laws to observable phenomena.

This article will guide you through the core concepts and broad implications of this seminal theory. In **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will construct the model from its Hamiltonian, introduce the crucial approximations that lead to exponential decay, and discuss consequences like the Lamb shift and short-time deviations. Following this, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** will showcase the theory's vast utility, explaining spectroscopic lineshapes, [photon antibunching](@entry_id:165214), collective effects in [quantum optics](@entry_id:140582), and the principles of reservoir engineering in cavity QED and [quantum thermodynamics](@entry_id:140152). Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will provide an opportunity to solidify your understanding by working through key derivations and exploring non-Markovian extensions. We begin by dissecting the principles and mechanisms that form the heart of the Wigner-Weisskopf model.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The phenomenon of [spontaneous emission](@entry_id:140032), where an excited quantum system decays to a lower energy state by emitting a photon into the vacuum, stands as a cornerstone of [quantum electrodynamics](@entry_id:154201). While a complete relativistic treatment is complex, the Wigner-Weisskopf theory provides a powerful and physically intuitive framework that captures the essential physics within a non-relativistic setting. This chapter develops the principles and mechanisms of this theory, beginning with the foundational Hamiltonian, proceeding through the key approximations that lead to the hallmark exponential decay, and concluding with an exploration of its more subtle consequences.

### The Model Hamiltonian for Atom-Field Interaction

The theoretical description of [spontaneous emission](@entry_id:140032) begins by modeling the total system, which consists of the atom (the **system** of interest) and the surrounding electromagnetic field (the **bath** or **reservoir**). The total Hamiltonian $H$ is additively composed of three parts: the system Hamiltonian $H_S$, the bath Hamiltonian $H_B$, and the interaction Hamiltonian $H_I$.

For simplicity and without loss of generality for many [atomic transitions](@entry_id:158267), we model the atom as a **[two-level system](@entry_id:138452)** with a ground state $|g\rangle$ and an excited state $|e\rangle$. The system Hamiltonian can be written as $H_S = \frac{\hbar\omega_0}{2}\sigma_z$, where $\omega_0$ is the transition frequency between the levels and $\sigma_z = |e\rangle\langle e| - |g\rangle\langle g|$ is a Pauli operator. This choice sets the [energy eigenvalues](@entry_id:144381) of the excited and ground states to $E_e = +\frac{\hbar\omega_0}{2}$ and $E_g = -\frac{\hbar\omega_0}{2}$, respectively, placing the zero of energy symmetrically between the two levels.

The electromagnetic field in free space is modeled as an infinite collection of independent harmonic oscillators, one for each field mode characterized by a [wavevector](@entry_id:178620) $\mathbf{k}$ and a polarization $\lambda$. The bath Hamiltonian is thus given by:
$H_B = \sum_{\mathbf{k},\lambda} \hbar\omega_k a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}$
where $a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger$ and $a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}$ are the [creation and annihilation operators](@entry_id:147121) for a photon in mode $(\mathbf{k}, \lambda)$, and $\omega_k = c|\mathbf{k}|$ is the photon's frequency. For simplicity, we often drop the polarization index, with the understanding that a sum over polarizations is implicitly included. Note that the constant [zero-point energy](@entry_id:142176) term, $\sum_{\mathbf{k},\lambda} \frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega_k$, is typically omitted. As a constant energy offset, it does not affect the [system dynamics](@entry_id:136288) and has no bearing on the occurrence of [spontaneous emission](@entry_id:140032), which is driven by the interaction term coupling different [number states](@entry_id:155105).

The interaction between the atom and the field is treated within the **[electric dipole approximation](@entry_id:150449)**. This approximation is valid under two physical conditions. First, the characteristic size of the atom, $a$ (e.g., the Bohr radius), must be much smaller than the wavelength $\lambda_0 = 2\pi c/\omega_0$ of the emitted light. This condition, $k_0 a \ll 1$ where $k_0 = \omega_0/c$, ensures that the spatial variation of the electric field across the atom's volume is negligible. Consequently, [the electric field operator](@entry_id:196320) $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})$ can be evaluated at a single point, the center of the atom $\mathbf{r}_0$. Higher-order multipole interactions, such as [magnetic dipole](@entry_id:275765) and [electric quadrupole](@entry_id:262852) terms, are suppressed by powers of the small parameter $k_0 a$ and can be safely neglected. Second, for this point-like approximation to be dynamically consistent, the atom's own [center-of-mass motion](@entry_id:747201) must be considered. If the atom is described by a quantum wavepacket of spatial extent $\Delta r$, this spread must also be much smaller than the relevant wavelength, $\Delta r \ll \lambda_0$. Together with the neglect of atomic recoil, this justifies treating the atom as fixed at position $\mathbf{r}_0$.

Under these conditions, the interaction Hamiltonian takes the simple form $H_I = -\mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}_0)$, where $\mathbf{d}$ is the atomic electric dipole operator. In the two-level basis, assuming states of definite parity, the dipole operator has no [diagonal matrix](@entry_id:637782) elements. Its action is to couple the ground and excited states. By choosing an appropriate [relative phase](@entry_id:148120) between $|e\rangle$ and $|g\rangle$, the [matrix representation](@entry_id:143451) of the operator can be made real and proportional to the Pauli operator $\sigma_x = |e\rangle\langle g| + |g\rangle\langle e|$. Thus, we write $\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{d}_{eg}(\sigma_+ + \sigma_-) = \mathbf{d}_{eg}\sigma_x$, where $\mathbf{d}_{eg} = \langle e|\mathbf{d}|g\rangle$ is the transition dipole moment and $\sigma_+ = |e\rangle\langle g|$, $\sigma_- = |g\rangle\langle e|$.

### The Wigner-Weisskopf Ansatz and the Single-Excitation Manifold

Substituting the standard expansion of the quantized electric field operator into the interaction Hamiltonian $H_I$ reveals four types of terms: $\sigma_+ a_k$, $\sigma_- a_k^\dagger$, $\sigma_+ a_k^\dagger$, and $\sigma_- a_k$. The first two terms, which represent the atom de-exciting while creating a photon and the atom exciting while absorbing a photon, are nearly energy-conserving for [field modes](@entry_id:189270) with $\omega_k \approx \omega_0$. The latter two terms, representing simultaneous excitation of the atom and creation of a photon or simultaneous de-excitation and absorption, violate energy conservation by a large amount, approximately $2\hbar\omega_0$.

The **Rotating-Wave Approximation (RWA)** consists of neglecting these rapidly oscillating, highly off-resonant "counter-rotating" terms. This approximation is justified under the condition of **weak coupling**, where the characteristic [coupling strength](@entry_id:275517) $g$ is much smaller than the atomic transition frequency, $g \ll \omega_0$. The resulting [spontaneous emission rate](@entry_id:189089) $\Gamma$ will also be much smaller than $\omega_0$, establishing a clear separation of timescales between the slow decay process (timescale $\sim 1/\Gamma$) and the fast optical oscillations (timescale $\sim 1/\omega_0$). The effects of the [counter-rotating terms](@entry_id:153937), oscillating at frequencies near $2\omega_0$, average to nearly zero over the slow timescale of the decay, and their contribution is suppressed by a small parameter on the order of $\Gamma/\omega_0$ or $g/\omega_0$.

With the RWA, the total Hamiltonian becomes:
$H = \hbar\omega_0 \sigma_+\sigma_- + \sum_k \hbar\omega_k a_k^\dagger a_k + \hbar \sum_k (g_k \sigma_+ a_k + g_k^* \sigma_- a_k^\dagger)$
where $g_k$ is the [coupling constant](@entry_id:160679) for mode $k$. This Hamiltonian possesses a crucial symmetry: it commutes with the total excitation [number operator](@entry_id:153568), $N = \sigma_+\sigma_- + \sum_k a_k^\dagger a_k$. This implies that the total number of excitations (one for an excited atom, one for each photon) is a conserved quantity.

This conservation law has a profound consequence. If the system starts in the state $|e, 0\rangle$—the atom excited and the field in vacuum—its total excitation number is $N=1$. Since $N$ is conserved, the system must remain forever within the subspace of states that also have $N=1$. This subspace is known as the **single-excitation manifold**. It is spanned by the initial state $|e, 0\rangle$ and all possible one-photon states $|g, 1_k\rangle$, where the atom is in its ground state and a single photon exists in mode $k$. The Wigner-Weisskopf theory is built upon this insight, postulating a state vector, or **[ansatz](@entry_id:184384)**, that is a superposition of only these [basis states](@entry_id:152463):
$|\psi(t)\rangle = c_e(t) |e, 0\rangle + \sum_k c_k(t) |g, 1_k\rangle$
Here, $c_e(t)$ is the [probability amplitude](@entry_id:150609) for the atom to remain in the excited state, and $c_k(t)$ is the amplitude for it to have decayed by emitting a photon into mode $k$. The problem of [spontaneous emission](@entry_id:140032) is thus reduced to finding the time evolution of the amplitude $c_e(t)$.

### From Microscopic Dynamics to the Memory Kernel

By substituting the Wigner-Weisskopf [ansatz](@entry_id:184384) into the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, $i\hbar \frac{d}{dt}|\psi(t)\rangle = H|\psi(t)\rangle$, we obtain a set of coupled [linear differential equations](@entry_id:150365) for the amplitudes $c_e(t)$ and $c_k(t)$. By formally integrating the equation for $c_k(t)$ (with the initial condition $c_k(0)=0$) and substituting the result back into the equation for $\dot{c}_e(t)$, we can eliminate the field amplitudes. This procedure yields a single, exact integro-differential equation for the excited-state amplitude:
$\dot{c}_e(t) = -\int_0^t d\tau \, \mathcal{K}(\tau) \, c_e(t-\tau)$
(Here we have shifted into an [interaction picture](@entry_id:140564) rotating at frequency $\omega_0$ to simplify the expression).

The function $\mathcal{K}(\tau)$ is the **memory kernel**. It describes how the past history of the amplitude $c_e(t-\tau)$ influences its present rate of change $\dot{c}_e(t)$. The reservoir is said to have "memory" because its state at time $t$ depends on the history of the atom's emissions. The explicit form of the kernel is found to be a sum over all [field modes](@entry_id:189270):
$\mathcal{K}(\tau) = \sum_k |g_k|^2 e^{-i(\omega_k - \omega_0)\tau}$

For a macroscopic environment like the electromagnetic vacuum, the [field modes](@entry_id:189270) are not discrete but form a continuum. This is formally handled by taking the **[continuum limit](@entry_id:162780)**, where the sum over modes is replaced by an integral: $\sum_k \rightarrow \frac{V}{(2\pi)^3} \int d^3k$. At this point, it becomes immensely useful to encapsulate all the relevant properties of the bath and its coupling to the system into a single function known as the **spectral density**, $J(\omega)$, defined as:
$J(\omega) = \sum_k |g_k|^2 \delta(\omega - \omega_k)$
In the [continuum limit](@entry_id:162780), this becomes a [smooth function](@entry_id:158037), $J(\omega) = \rho(\omega) \langle|g(\omega)|^2\rangle$, where $\rho(\omega)$ is the density of states of the field and $\langle|g(\omega)|^2\rangle$ is the squared [coupling strength](@entry_id:275517) averaged over modes of frequency $\omega$. For the electromagnetic field in three-dimensional free space, the density of states is $\rho(\omega) \propto \omega^2$.

With the [spectral density](@entry_id:139069), the memory kernel can be expressed elegantly as a Fourier-like transform:
$\mathcal{K}(\tau) = \int_0^\infty d\omega \, J(\omega) \, e^{-i(\omega - \omega_0)\tau}$
This expression is central: it connects the microscopic physics contained in $J(\omega)$ to the memory effects governing the system's dynamics.

### The Markov Approximation and Exponential Decay

The integro-differential equation for $c_e(t)$ is generally difficult to solve. The Wigner-Weisskopf theory's key step is to invoke the **Markov approximation**, which posits that the reservoir has an extremely short memory. The physical justification rests on the properties of the electromagnetic vacuum. The [memory kernel](@entry_id:155089) $\mathcal{K}(\tau)$ is mathematically related to the vacuum **bath correlation function** $C(\tau) = \langle B(\tau) B^\dagger(0) \rangle$, where $B = \sum_k g_k a_k$ is the collective bath operator that couples to the atom. The duration over which this [correlation function](@entry_id:137198) (and thus the kernel) is non-zero is the **bath [correlation time](@entry_id:176698)**, $\tau_B$.

There is a fundamental reciprocal relationship, dictated by the Fourier transform, between the width of the spectral density $J(\omega)$ in the frequency domain and the correlation time $\tau_B$ in the time domain. A spectrally broad reservoir corresponds to a short correlation time. For example, if $J(\omega)$ were a flat "boxcar" function of width $\Delta$, the kernel $\mathcal{K}(\tau)$ would be a [sinc function](@entry_id:274746) with a [main lobe width](@entry_id:274761) scaling as $1/\Delta$. The electromagnetic vacuum has an extremely broad, smooth [spectral density](@entry_id:139069), meaning its [correlation time](@entry_id:176698) $\tau_B$ is exceptionally short.

The Markov approximation is valid if this correlation time is much shorter than the [characteristic timescale](@entry_id:276738) of the system's own evolution, i.e., the decay time $1/\gamma$. This condition, $\tau_B \ll 1/\gamma$, ensures that the amplitude $c_e(t)$ does not change significantly over the interval where the [memory kernel](@entry_id:155089) is active. We can therefore make the approximation $c_e(t-\tau) \approx c_e(t)$ inside the integral. Furthermore, because $\mathcal{K}(\tau)$ decays so quickly, we can extend the upper limit of the [time integration](@entry_id:170891) from $t$ to $\infty$ with negligible error for times $t \gg \tau_B$. These steps transform the non-local integro-differential equation into a simple, local, first-order differential equation:
$\dot{c}_e(t) \approx - \left( \int_0^\infty d\tau \, \mathcal{K}(\tau) \right) c_e(t)$

The final step is to evaluate the complex constant $K = \int_0^\infty d\tau \, \mathcal{K}(\tau)$. Substituting the expression for the kernel and performing the integration over $\tau$ requires regularizing a divergent integral, which is accomplished formally using the Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem. This mathematical tool cleanly separates the result into a real and an imaginary part:
$\int_0^\infty d\tau \, e^{-i(\omega - \omega_0)\tau} = \pi\delta(\omega - \omega_0) - i\mathcal{P}\left(\frac{1}{\omega - \omega_0}\right)$
where $\mathcal{P}$ denotes the Cauchy Principal Value.

Integrating this against the spectral density $J(\omega)$ yields the complex rate $K = \frac{\gamma}{2} + i\Delta$. The real part, arising from the delta function, gives half the decay rate, while the imaginary part, from the [principal value](@entry_id:192761), gives the frequency shift.
- **Decay Rate (Fermi's Golden Rule):** $\gamma = 2\pi J(\omega_0)$. The decay rate is proportional to the spectral density evaluated *at* the atomic resonance frequency. This represents the contribution from real, energy-conserving transitions.
- **Frequency Shift (Lamb Shift):** $\Delta = \mathcal{P}\int_0^\infty d\omega \, \frac{J(\omega)}{\omega_0 - \omega}$. This shift in the atomic transition frequency arises from the "virtual" emission and reabsorption of photons of all frequencies.

The equation of motion for the excited-state amplitude becomes $\dot{c}_e(t) = -(\frac{\gamma}{2} + i\Delta)c_e(t)$, which has the simple solution $c_e(t) = c_e(0) e^{-(\gamma/2 + i\Delta)t}$. The probability of finding the atom in the excited state is then:
$P_e(t) = |c_e(t)|^2 = |c_e(0)|^2 e^{-\gamma t}$
This is the celebrated [exponential decay law](@entry_id:161923) of [spontaneous emission](@entry_id:140032). It emerges directly from the assumption of a weak coupling to a spectrally broad, memoryless reservoir. A more rigorous analysis via Laplace transforms confirms that this exponential decay corresponds to the contribution from the dominant pole of the system's [propagator](@entry_id:139558) in the [complex frequency plane](@entry_id:190333).

### Advanced Topics and Consequences

#### The Lamb Shift and Renormalization

While the decay rate $\gamma$ depends only on the local value of the [spectral density](@entry_id:139069) $J(\omega_0)$, the frequency shift $\Delta$ is a more subtle quantity. The [principal value](@entry_id:192761) integral $\mathcal{P}\int_0^\infty d\omega \, \frac{J(\omega)}{\omega_0 - \omega}$ is sensitive to the structure of $J(\omega)$ across the entire frequency spectrum, including its behavior at very high, or ultraviolet (UV), frequencies. For many physical models of the environment, this integral diverges unless a high-frequency **cutoff**, $\Omega_c$, is introduced.

For example, for a common **Ohmic** spectral density of the form $J(\omega) = \alpha \omega e^{-\omega/\Omega_c}$, the calculated Lamb shift contains terms that diverge as the cutoff is taken to infinity (e.g., terms proportional to $\Omega_c$ and $\ln(\Omega_c)$). This is not a failure of the theory, but an indication that the "bare" transition frequency $\omega_0$ we started with is not a physically observable quantity. The physically measured frequency is the "dressed" frequency, which includes the shift induced by the vacuum. The procedure of **[renormalization](@entry_id:143501)** involves absorbing the divergent, cutoff-dependent parts of the shift into the definition of a renormalized bare frequency, leaving a finite, physically meaningful residual shift.

#### Short-Time Dynamics and the Quantum Zeno Effect

The [exponential decay law](@entry_id:161923) is an approximation valid for times $t \gg \tau_B$. At very short times, the evolution is fundamentally non-exponential. A direct expansion of the [survival probability](@entry_id:137919) $P_e(t)$ from first principles, without the Markov approximation, reveals a universal quadratic behavior for any system with a finite [energy variance](@entry_id:156656):
$P_e(t) = 1 - (\delta\omega)^2 t^2 + \mathcal{O}(t^4)$
where $(\delta\omega)^2 = \langle\omega^2\rangle - \langle\omega\rangle^2$ is the variance of the energy distribution of the initial state, which is given by the [spectral function](@entry_id:147628) $J(\omega)$. For instance, if $J(\omega)$ has a Gaussian profile with standard deviation $\sigma$, then $(\delta\omega)^2 = \sigma^2$.

This initial quadratic decay is the foundation of the **Quantum Zeno Effect**. If one repeatedly performs [projective measurements](@entry_id:140238) on the atom at short time intervals $\Delta t$ to check if it is still excited, the probability of surviving $N$ such measurements over a total time $T = N\Delta t$ is $[P_e(\Delta t)]^N \approx (1 - (\delta\omega)^2(\Delta t)^2)^N$. In the limit of continuous observation ($\Delta t \to 0$, $N \to \infty$), this probability approaches 1. The frequent measurements continually reset the evolution to the beginning of its [quadratic phase](@entry_id:203790), effectively "freezing" the atom in its excited state and preventing decay.

#### Conservation Laws and the Open System Perspective

A final, crucial point is the reconciliation of the apparent irreversible decay of the atom with the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. The total system, atom plus field, is a [closed system](@entry_id:139565) governed by a Hermitian Hamiltonian. Its evolution is therefore **unitary**, and its total energy is strictly **conserved**.

The Wigner-Weisskopf theory beautifully illustrates how irreversible behavior emerges in a subsystem. The energy initially localized in the atom does not vanish; it is coherently transferred and delocalized into the continuum of electromagnetic [field modes](@entry_id:189270). The ansatz $|\psi(t)\rangle$ describes this redistribution, with the squared amplitude $|c_e(t)|^2$ decreasing as the sum of squared amplitudes $\sum_k |c_k(t)|^2$ increases to take its place, always maintaining $\langle\psi(t)|\psi(t)\rangle=1$. Because the number of [field modes](@entry_id:189270) is infinite, the probability of the delocalized energy spontaneously re-collecting to re-excite the atom (a Poincaré recurrence) is effectively zero. Thus, from the perspective of the atom alone, the decay is for all practical purposes irreversible. The exponential decay is not a sign of non-[unitarity](@entry_id:138773) in the universe, but rather an emergent property of a small system coupled to a large, featureless reservoir.
