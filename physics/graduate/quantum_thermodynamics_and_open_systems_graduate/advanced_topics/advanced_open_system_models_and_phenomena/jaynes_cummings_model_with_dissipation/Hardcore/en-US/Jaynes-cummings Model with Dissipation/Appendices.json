            "solution": "The problem is to derive the steady-state mean photon number in a driven, lossy cavity containing a single two-level atom, under the weak-drive approximation. This is a standard problem in cavity quantum electrodynamics, described by the Jaynes-Cummings model with dissipation and drive.\n\nThe process begins by establishing the equations of motion for the expectation values of the relevant system operators, derived from the given Lindblad master equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\rho}{dt}=-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left[H,\\rho\\right]+\\kappa\\,\\mathcal{D}[a]\\rho+\\gamma\\,\\mathcal{D}[\\sigma_{-}]\\rho\n$$\nThe expectation value of an operator $O$ evolves according to $\\frac{d\\langle O \\rangle}{dt} = \\text{Tr}(\\dot{\\rho}O)$. Using the master equation and the cyclic property of the trace, this gives the general formula:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle O \\rangle}{dt} = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\langle[H, O]\\rangle + \\kappa \\left( \\langle a^{\\dagger} O a \\rangle - \\frac{1}{2}\\langle\\{a^{\\dagger}a, O\\}\\rangle \\right) + \\gamma \\left( \\langle \\sigma_{+} O \\sigma_{-} \\rangle - \\frac{1}{2}\\langle\\{\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-}, O\\}\\rangle \\right)\n$$\n\nFirst, we derive the equation of motion for the expectation value of the cavity field annihilation operator, $\\langle a \\rangle$.\nThe Hamiltonian in the rotating frame is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{H}{\\hbar}=\\Delta_{c}\\,a^{\\dagger}a+\\Delta_{a}\\,\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-}+g\\left(a\\,\\sigma_{+}+a^{\\dagger}\\sigma_{-}\\right)+i\\left(\\eta\\,a^{\\dagger}-\\eta^{*}\\,a\\right)\n$$\nThe commutator term is:\n$$\n\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\langle[H, a]\\rangle = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\langle[\\Delta_{c}\\,a^{\\dagger}a+g\\,a^{\\dagger}\\sigma_{-}+i\\eta a^{\\dagger}, a]\\rangle = i\\langle-\\Delta_{c}a - g\\sigma_{-} - i\\eta\\rangle = -i\\Delta_{c}\\langle a \\rangle - ig\\langle \\sigma_{-} \\rangle + \\eta\n$$\nThe dissipation term for the cavity decay is:\n$$\n\\kappa\\left( \\langle a^{\\dagger} a a \\rangle - \\frac{1}{2}\\langle a^{\\dagger}a a + a a^{\\dagger}a \\rangle \\right) = \\kappa\\left( \\langle a^{\\dagger} a a \\rangle - \\frac{1}{2}\\langle a^{\\dagger}a a + (a^{\\dagger}a+1)a \\rangle \\right) = \\kappa\\left( -\\frac{1}{2}\\langle a \\rangle \\right) = -\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\langle a \\rangle\n$$\nThe atomic decay term does not affect $\\langle a \\rangle$ because atomic operators commute with $a$. Combining these terms, we get the equation of motion for $\\langle a \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle a \\rangle}{dt} = -i\\Delta_{c}\\langle a \\rangle - ig\\langle \\sigma_{-} \\rangle + \\eta - \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\langle a \\rangle = -\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2} + i\\Delta_{c}\\right)\\langle a \\rangle - ig\\langle \\sigma_{-} \\rangle + \\eta\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the equation of motion for the atomic lowering operator, $\\langle \\sigma_{-} \\rangle$.\nThe commutator term is:\n$$\n\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\langle[H, \\sigma_{-}]\\rangle = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\langle[\\Delta_{a}\\,\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-}+g\\,a\\sigma_{+}, \\sigma_{-}]\\rangle = i\\langle-\\Delta_{a}\\sigma_{-} + g a [\\sigma_{+}, \\sigma_{-}]\\rangle\n$$\nUsing $[\\sigma_{+}, \\sigma_{-}] = \\sigma_z$, where $\\sigma_z = |e\\rangle\\langle e| - |g\\rangle\\langle g|$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\langle[H, \\sigma_{-}]\\rangle = -i\\Delta_{a}\\langle\\sigma_{-}\\rangle + ig\\langle a\\sigma_{z}\\rangle\n$$\nThe dissipation term for atomic decay is:\n$$\n\\gamma\\left( \\langle \\sigma_{+} \\sigma_{-} \\sigma_{-} \\rangle - \\frac{1}{2}\\langle \\{\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-}, \\sigma_{-}\\} \\rangle \\right) = \\gamma\\left( 0 - \\frac{1}{2}\\langle \\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-}\\sigma_{-} + \\sigma_{-}\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-} \\rangle \\right) = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\langle \\sigma_{-} \\rangle\n$$\nwhere we used $\\sigma_{-}^2=0$ and $\\sigma_{-}\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-} = \\sigma_{-}(1-\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-}) = \\sigma_{-}$.\nThe cavity decay term does not affect $\\langle \\sigma_{-} \\rangle$. The full equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle \\sigma_{-} \\rangle}{dt} = -i\\Delta_{a}\\langle\\sigma_{-}\\rangle + ig\\langle a\\sigma_{z}\\rangle - \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\langle\\sigma_{-}\\rangle = -\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2} + i\\Delta_{a}\\right)\\langle\\sigma_{-}\\rangle + ig\\langle a\\sigma_{z}\\rangle\n$$\n\nTo solve for the steady state, we set the time derivatives to zero, yielding a system of coupled algebraic equations. To close this system, we employ the weak-drive approximation, which has two main consequences:\n1.  The atom remains mostly in its ground state $|g\\rangle$. The atomic inversion is therefore $\\langle\\sigma_z\\rangle = \\langle\\sigma_+\\sigma_-\\rangle - \\langle\\sigma_-\\sigma_+\\rangle \\approx 0 - 1 = -1$.\n2.  Correlations between the cavity field and the atomic state are negligible. This justifies the factorization (mean-field) approximation $\\langle a\\sigma_{z}\\rangle \\approx \\langle a\\rangle \\langle\\sigma_{z}\\rangle$.\nCombining these, we make the key linearization: $\\langle a\\sigma_{z}\\rangle_{s} \\approx \\langle a\\rangle_{s} \\langle\\sigma_{z}\\rangle_{s} \\approx -\\langle a\\rangle_{s}$.\n\nApplying these approximations to the steady-state equations (denoted by subscript $s$):\n1.  $0 = -\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2} + i\\Delta_{c}\\right)\\langle a \\rangle_{s} - ig\\langle \\sigma_{-} \\rangle_{s} + \\eta$\n2.  $0 = -\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2} + i\\Delta_{a}\\right)\\langle\\sigma_{-}\\rangle_{s} + ig\\langle a\\sigma_{z}\\rangle_{s} \\approx -\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2} + i\\Delta_{a}\\right)\\langle\\sigma_{-}\\rangle_{s} - ig\\langle a \\rangle_{s}$\n\nFrom the second equation, we solve for $\\langle \\sigma_{-} \\rangle_{s}$:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma_{-} \\rangle_{s} = \\frac{-ig}{\\frac{\\gamma}{2} + i\\Delta_{a}} \\langle a \\rangle_{s}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\langle\\sigma_{-}\\rangle_s$ back into the first steady-state equation for $\\langle a \\rangle_s$:\n$$\n0 = -\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2} + i\\Delta_{c}\\right)\\langle a \\rangle_{s} - ig \\left( \\frac{-ig}{\\frac{\\gamma}{2} + i\\Delta_{a}} \\langle a \\rangle_s \\right) + \\eta\n$$\n$$\n0 = -\\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2} + i\\Delta_{c}\\right) + \\frac{g^2}{\\frac{\\gamma}{2} + i\\Delta_a} \\right] \\langle a \\rangle_s + \\eta\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\langle a \\rangle_{s}$ yields:\n$$\n\\langle a \\rangle_{s} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2} + i\\Delta_{c}\\right) + \\frac{g^{2}}{\\frac{\\gamma}{2} + i\\Delta_{a}}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the steady-state coherent amplitude of the cavity field.\n\nThe mean photon number is $\\bar{n} = \\langle a^{\\dagger}a \\rangle_{s}$. In the weak-drive limit, the cavity field is in a state that is approximately a coherent state with amplitude $\\langle a \\rangle_{s}$. For a coherent state, $\\langle a^{\\dagger}a \\rangle = |\\langle a \\rangle|^2$. This approximation is consistent with the mean-field factorization used earlier.\nThus, we calculate $\\bar{n} = |\\langle a \\rangle_{s}|^2$:\n$$\n\\bar{n} = \\frac{|\\eta|^2}{\\left| \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2} + i\\Delta_{c}\\right) + \\frac{g^2}{\\frac{\\gamma}{2} + i\\Delta_{a}} \\right|^2}\n$$\nTo obtain the final form, we evaluate the squared modulus of the denominator. Let's separate the denominator into its real and imaginary parts:\n$$\nD = \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2} + i\\Delta_{c}\\right) + \\frac{g^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2} - i\\Delta_{a}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)^2 + \\Delta_{a}^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2} + \\frac{g^2\\frac{\\gamma}{2}}{\\Delta_a^2 + \\frac{\\gamma^2}{4}}\\right) + i\\left(\\Delta_c - \\frac{g^2\\Delta_a}{\\Delta_a^2 + \\frac{\\gamma^2}{4}}\\right)\n$$\nThe squared modulus is $|D|^2 = (\\text{Re}[D])^2 + (\\text{Im}[D])^2$.\nSo, the steady-state mean photon number is:\n$$\n\\bar{n} = \\frac{|\\eta|^2}{\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2} + \\frac{g^2\\gamma/2}{\\Delta_a^2 + \\gamma^2/4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\Delta_c - \\frac{g^2\\Delta_a}{\\Delta_a^2 + \\gamma^2/4}\\right)^2}\n$$\n\nFor the second part of the question, we consider a higher drive power, where the atom is no longer guaranteed to be near the ground state. The approximation $\\langle\\sigma_z\\rangle_s \\approx -1$ fails. Instead, the steady-state inversion $\\langle\\sigma_z\\rangle_s$ becomes dependent on the intracavity photon number $\\bar{n}_s = |\\langle a \\rangle_s|^2$. A more complete analysis shows that $\\langle\\sigma_z\\rangle_s = -1 / (1+S)$, where $S$ is a saturation parameter proportional to $\\bar{n}_s$.\nThe consequence of this is that the linearization $\\langle a\\sigma_z\\rangle_s \\approx -\\langle a\\rangle_s$ must be replaced by $\\langle a\\sigma_z\\rangle_s \\approx \\langle a\\rangle_s \\langle\\sigma_z\\rangle_s$.\nThis propagates through the derivation. The expression for $\\langle a \\rangle_s$ becomes:\n$$\n\\langle a \\rangle_{s} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2} + i\\Delta_{c}\\right) - \\frac{g^{2}\\langle\\sigma_z\\rangle_s}{\\frac{\\gamma}{2} + i\\Delta_{a}}} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2} + i\\Delta_{c}\\right) + \\frac{g^{2}(-\\langle\\sigma_z\\rangle_s)}{\\frac{\\gamma}{2} + i\\Delta_{a}}}\n$$\nThis reveals that the atom's contribution to the cavity response is renormalized. In the weak-drive formula, the atom's effect is captured by the term proportional to $g^2$. In the nonlinear regime, this $g^2$ is effectively replaced by an intensity-dependent coupling $g^2_{\\text{eff}} = g^2(-\\langle\\sigma_z\\rangle_s)$. Since $\\langle\\sigma_z\\rangle_s$ increases from $-1$ towards $0$ as the drive power and $\\bar{n}_s$ increase, the factor $(-\\langle\\sigma_z\\rangle_s)$ decreases from $1$ towards $0$.\nThis saturation effect means the atom becomes \"bleached\" or more transparent to the cavity field. The atomic contribution to both the effective cavity decay rate (the real part of the self-energy) and the effective cavity frequency shift (the imaginary part) is reduced. This leads to a nonlinear relationship between the input drive power $|\\eta|^2$ and the intracavity photon number $\\bar{n}$, famously giving rise to optical bistability under appropriate conditions.",

            "solution": "The analysis of this problem proceeds in several stages: first, establishing the full quantum master equation for the coupled qubit-cavity system; second, performing an adiabatic elimination of the fast-decaying cavity mode to derive an effective master equation for the qubit alone; and third, solving this effective master equation for the steady-state excited population under the specified conditions of resonant and weak driving. Throughout this derivation, we set the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar = 1$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the qubit-cavity system, including the direct drive on the qubit, is given in the rotating wave approximation (RWA) by:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{lab}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{q}\\sigma_z + \\omega_{c} a^\\dagger a + g(\\sigma_+ a + \\sigma_- a^\\dagger) + \\frac{\\Omega}{2}(\\sigma_+ e^{-i\\omega_d t} + \\sigma_- e^{i\\omega_d t})$$\nHere, $\\omega_q$ and $\\omega_c$ are the bare frequencies of the qubit and cavity, respectively. $g$ is their coupling strength, and $\\Omega$ is the Rabi frequency of the classical drive at frequency $\\omega_d$. The operators $\\sigma_{z,+, -}$ are the Pauli operators for the qubit, and $a, a^\\dagger$ are the annihilation and creation operators for the cavity mode.\n\nTo remove the time dependence, we transform into a frame rotating at the drive frequency $\\omega_d$ using the unitary operator $U(t) = \\exp[i\\omega_d t (\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_z + a^\\dagger a)]$. The transformed Hamiltonian $H = U H_{\\mathrm{lab}} U^\\dagger - i U \\dot{U}^\\dagger$ is:\n$$H = \\frac{1}{2}(\\omega_q - \\omega_d)\\sigma_z + (\\omega_c - \\omega_d)a^\\dagger a + g(\\sigma_+ a + \\sigma_- a^\\dagger) + \\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\sigma_x$$\nWe define the detunings from the drive frequency as $\\delta_q \\equiv \\omega_q - \\omega_d$ and $\\delta_c \\equiv \\omega_c - \\omega_d$.

This procedure is valid when the cavity's dynamics are much faster than the qubit's, allowing the cavity to be treated as being in a perpetual quasi-steady state that follows the qubit's slower evolution. The primary physical assumption for this is that the cavity decay rate is the largest rate in the system, i.e., $\\kappa \\gg g, |\\Delta|$. This is the \"bad cavity\" limit.\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the equation of motion for the cavity annihilation operator is:\n$$\\dot{a} = i[H, a] - \\frac{\\kappa}{2}a = -i(\\delta_c a + g\\sigma_-) - \\frac{\\kappa}{2}a = -(i\\delta_c + \\frac{\\kappa}{2})a - ig\\sigma_-$$\nIn the adiabatic approximation, we set $\\dot{a} \\approx 0$ to find the slaved steady-state operator $a_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t) \\approx \\frac{-ig}{i\\delta_c + \\kappa/2}\\sigma_-(t)$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the Heisenberg equation for a qubit operator, such as $\\sigma_-$, which is $\\dot{\\sigma}_- = i\\delta_q\\sigma_- + ig\\sigma_z a - i\\frac{\\Omega}{2}[\\sigma_-, \\sigma_x] = i\\delta_q \\sigma_- + ig a \\sigma_z - i\\Omega \\sigma_z$, and replacing $a$ with $a_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ and using $\\sigma_z\\sigma_- = -\\sigma_-$, we find the effective evolution for $\\sigma_-$:\n$$\\dot{\\sigma}_- \\approx i\\delta_q \\sigma_- - \\frac{g^2}{i\\delta_c + \\kappa/2}\\sigma_- - i\\Omega \\sigma_z = \\left( i\\delta_q - \\frac{g^2(\\kappa/2 - i\\delta_c)}{\\delta_c^2 + \\kappa^2/4} \\right)\\sigma_- - i\\Omega\\sigma_z$$\n$$\\dot{\\sigma}_- \\approx \\left( i\\left(\\delta_q + \\frac{g^2\\delta_c}{\\delta_c^2 + \\kappa^2/4}\\right) - \\frac{g^2\\kappa/2}{\\delta_c^2 + \\kappa^2/4} \\right)\\sigma_- - i\\Omega\\sigma_z$$\nFrom this, we identify the cavity-induced shift of the qubit frequency (Lamb shift), $\\delta_{LS}$, and the decay rate (Purcell decay), $\\Gamma_P$:\n$$\\delta_{LS} = \\frac{g^2\\delta_c}{\\delta_c^2 + \\kappa^2/4}$$\n$$\\Gamma_P = \\frac{g^2\\kappa}{\\delta_c^2 + \\kappa^2/4}$$\nThe effective qubit-only master equation for the reduced density matrix $\\rho_q = \\mathrm{Tr}_{\\mathrm{cavity}}[\\rho]$ is:\n$$\\dot{\\rho}_q = -i[H_{\\mathrm{eff}}, \\rho_q] + \\Gamma_P \\mathcal{D}[\\sigma_-]\\rho_q$$\nwith the effective Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta_q + \\delta_{LS})\\sigma_z + \\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\sigma_x$.\n\nThe problem specifies a resonant drive on the Lamb-shifted qubit.

However, the condition for adiabatic elimination, $\\kappa \\gg g$, justifies a perturbative approach. To leading order in $g^2$, the right-hand side is small, implying $\\delta_q$ is small.

In this regime, the $2\\Omega^2$ term in the denominator can be neglected, yielding:\n$$\\rho_{ee}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} \\approx \\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\Gamma_P^2}$$\nFinally, we substitute the derived expression for the Purcell rate $\\Gamma_P$:\n$$\\rho_{ee}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} \\approx \\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\left( \\frac{g^2\\kappa}{\\Delta^2 + \\kappa^2/4} \\right)^2}$$\nRearranging this gives the final closed-form expression:\n$$\\rho_{ee}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} = \\frac{\\Omega^2 (\\Delta^2 + \\kappa^2/4)^2}{g^4 \\kappa^2}$$",

            "solution": "The first-order spectrum of the cavity field is given by the Fourier transform of the two-time correlation function $G^{(1)}(t) = \\langle a^{\\dagger}(t) a(0) \\rangle_{ss}$, where the expectation is taken in the steady state $\\rho_{ss}$. The positions of the spectral peaks are determined by the oscillatory frequencies of $G^{(1)}(t)$, and their linewidths are determined by the decay rates.\n\nThe quantum regression theorem (QRT) states that for $t > 0$, the dynamics of a two-time correlation function $\\langle B(0)A(t) \\rangle$ follows the same equations of motion as the single-time expectation value $\\langle A(t) \\rangle$. We will therefore first establish the equations of motion for the relevant operators in the Heisenberg picture.\n\nThe Heisenberg equation of motion for an operator $O$ governed by the given Lindblad master equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dO}{dt} = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}[H, O] + \\kappa \\mathcal{D}^{\\dagger}[a](O) + \\gamma \\mathcal{D}^{\\dagger}[\\sigma_{-}](O)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{D}^{\\dagger}[L](O) = L^{\\dagger}OL - \\frac{1}{2}\\{L^{\\dagger}L, O\\}$.\n\nLet us derive the equations for the operators $a$ and $\\sigma_{-}$. We set $\\omega_c = \\omega_a = \\omega$ due to the resonance condition.\nFor the operator $a$:\n- Commutator term: $\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[H,a] = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\hbar\\omega a^{\\dagger}a + \\hbar g a \\sigma_{+}, a] = -i\\omega a - ig\\sigma_{-}$.\n- Dissipative term for $\\kappa$: $\\kappa \\mathcal{D}^{\\dagger}[a](a) = \\kappa(a^{\\dagger}aa - \\frac{1}{2}\\{a^{\\dagger}a, a\\}) = \\kappa(a^{\\dagger}aa - \\frac{1}{2}(a^{\\dagger}aa + a a^{\\dagger}a)) = -\\frac{\\kappa}{2}a$.\n- Dissipative term for $\\gamma$: $\\gamma \\mathcal{D}^{\\dagger}[\\sigma_{-}](a) = \\gamma(\\sigma_{+}a\\sigma_{-} - \\frac{1}{2}\\{\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-}, a\\}) = 0$, since $[a, \\sigma_{\\pm}] = 0$.\nSo, the equation for $a$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = -i\\omega a - ig\\sigma_{-} - \\frac{\\kappa}{2}a\n$$\n\nFor the operator $\\sigma_{-}$:\n- Commutator term: $\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[H,\\sigma_{-}] = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2}\\sigma_z + \\hbar g a^{\\dagger}\\sigma_{-}, \\sigma_{-}] = -i\\omega\\sigma_{-} + ig a^{\\dagger}[\\sigma_{-},\\sigma_{-}] + ig[a^{\\dagger},\\sigma_{-}]\\sigma_{-} = -i\\omega\\sigma_{-} - ig a \\sigma_z$.\n- Dissipative term for $\\kappa$: $\\kappa \\mathcal{D}^{\\dagger}[a](\\sigma_{-}) = 0$.\n- Dissipative term for $\\gamma$: $\\gamma \\mathcal{D}^{\\dagger}[\\sigma_{-}](\\sigma_{-}) = \\gamma(\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-}\\sigma_{-} - \\frac{1}{2}\\{\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-}, \\sigma_{-}\\}) = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\sigma_{-}$.\nSo, the equation for $\\sigma_{-}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_{-}}{dt} = -i\\omega\\sigma_{-} + iga\\sigma_z - \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\sigma_{-}\n$$\nThese equations are nonlinear due to the $\\sigma_z$ term. However, the problem specifies a weak drive, implying the system resides predominantly in the single-excitation manifold built upon the ground state $|g, 0\\rangle$. When considering the dynamics of single-quantum correlators, we can linearize the equations by replacing $\\sigma_z$ with its expectation value in the ground state, i.e., $\\sigma_z \\approx -1$. This is a standard procedure for calculating the emission spectrum.\n\nThe linearized system of equations is:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = -\\left(i\\omega + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\right)a - ig\\sigma_{-} \\\\\n\\frac{d\\sigma_{-}}{dt} = -iga - \\left(i\\omega + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)\\sigma_{-}\n$$\nTo simplify, we move to an interaction picture (rotating frame) with respect to the frequency $\\omega$. Let $\\tilde{a}(t) = a(t)e^{i\\omega t}$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{-}(t) = \\sigma_{-}(t)e^{i\\omega t}$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{a}}{dt} = \\frac{da}{dt}e^{i\\omega t} + i\\omega a e^{i\\omega t} = \\left(-\\left(i\\omega + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\right)a - ig\\sigma_{-}\\right)e^{i\\omega t} + i\\omega \\tilde{a} = -\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\tilde{a} - ig\\tilde{\\sigma}_{-}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{\\sigma}_{-}}{dt} = \\frac{d\\sigma_{-}}{dt}e^{i\\omega t} + i\\omega \\sigma_{-} e^{i\\omega t} = \\left(-iga - \\left(i\\omega + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)\\sigma_{-}\\right)e^{i\\omega t} + i\\omega \\tilde{\\sigma}_{-} = -ig\\tilde{a} - \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\tilde{\\sigma}_{-}\n$$\nWe can write this as a matrix equation for the vector of operators $V(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\tilde{a}(t) \\\\ \\tilde{\\sigma}_{-}(t) \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}V(t) = M V(t), \\quad \\text{where} \\quad M = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{\\kappa}{2} & -ig \\\\ -ig & -\\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix $M$ is a representation of the non-unitary dynamical generator (the adjoint Liouvillian, $\\mathcal{L}^\\dagger$) projected onto the basis of single-excitation lowering operators. According to the QRT, the correlation functions involving these operators will evolve according to the same linear system. The eigenvalues of $M$ determine the decay rates and frequency shifts of the system's normal modes.\n\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $M$ are found from the characteristic equation $\\det(M-\\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{\\kappa}{2} - \\lambda\\right)\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{2} - \\lambda\\right) - (-ig)(-ig) = 0 \\\\\n\\lambda^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\kappa+\\gamma}{2}\\right)\\lambda + \\frac{\\kappa\\gamma}{4} + g^2 = 0\n$$\nThe solutions are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\frac{-\\left(\\frac{\\kappa+\\gamma}{2}\\right) \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\kappa+\\gamma}{2}\\right)^2 - 4\\left(g^2 + \\frac{\\kappa\\gamma}{4}\\right)}}{2}\n= -\\frac{\\kappa+\\gamma}{4} \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{(\\kappa+\\gamma)^2}{4} - 4g^2 - \\kappa\\gamma}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = -\\frac{\\kappa+\\gamma}{4} \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa^2+2\\kappa\\gamma+\\gamma^2 - 16g^2 - 4\\kappa\\gamma}{4}} = -\\frac{\\kappa+\\gamma}{4} \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\kappa-\\gamma}{2}\\right)^2 - 4g^2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the strong-coupling regime, where the coupling $g$ is much larger than the decay rates, $g \\gg \\kappa, \\gamma$. This implies $4g^2 \\gg \\left(\\frac{\\kappa-\\gamma}{2}\\right)^2$. Therefore, the term inside the square root is negative, and we can write:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = -\\frac{\\kappa+\\gamma}{4} \\pm \\frac{i}{2}\\sqrt{4g^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\kappa-\\gamma}{2}\\right)^2}\n$$\nIn the strong-coupling limit, we can approximate this further:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} \\approx -\\frac{\\kappa+\\gamma}{4} \\pm ig\n$$\nThe correlation function $\\langle a^{\\dagger}(t) a(0) \\rangle_{ss}$ for $t>0$ will evolve as a linear combination of terms proportional to $e^{(\\lambda_{\\pm}-i\\omega)t}$. The spectrum $S(\\omega')$ is the Fourier transform of this function. The spectrum will thus be composed of two Lorentzian peaks. The imaginary parts of the eigenvalues correspond to the frequencies of the peaks, and the real parts correspond to their decay rates.\n\nThe frequencies in the lab frame are given by $\\omega' = \\omega - \\text{Im}(\\lambda_{\\pm}) \\approx \\omega \\mp g$. These are the two vacuum Rabi peaks, split symmetrically about the uncoupled resonance frequency $\\omega$.\n\nThe decay rate of the correlation function's envelope is given by the magnitude of the real part of the eigenvalues, $\\Gamma = |\\text{Re}(\\lambda_{\\pm})| = \\frac{\\kappa+\\gamma}{4}$.\nA temporal decay of the form $e^{-\\Gamma t}$ corresponds to a power spectrum with a Lorentzian profile of the form $\\frac{1}{\\Gamma^2 + (\\omega'-\\omega'_0)^2}$. This profile has a half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) equal to $\\Gamma$.\n\nThus, the HWHM for each of the vacuum Rabi peaks is:\n$$\n\\text{HWHM} = \\frac{\\kappa+\\gamma}{4}\n$$\nThis result is independent of the coupling strength $g$ in the strong-coupling limit, and it is the same for both peaks. This is physically intuitive: in the strong-coupling limit, the dressed states $|\\pm\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|g, 1\\rangle \\pm |e, 0\\rangle)$ are equal superpositions of the atomic excitation (decaying at rate $\\gamma$) and the photonic excitation (decaying at rate $\\kappa$). The decay rate of each dressed state is therefore the average of the two individual decay rates, which corresponds to the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the spectral lines, $\\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma + \\kappa)$. The half-width is half of this value, yielding the final result.",
