The system is driven by a longitudinal periodic field of angular frequency $\\Omega$ and amplitude $A$, and its Hamiltonian (in units where $\\hbar=1$) is\n$$\nH(t)=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}}{2}\\,|\\alpha\\rangle\\langle\\alpha|+\\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\beta}}{2}\\,|\\beta\\rangle\\langle\\beta|+g\\left(|\\alpha\\rangle\\langle\\beta|+|\\beta\\rangle\\langle\\alpha|\\right)+A\\cos(\\Omega t)\\left(|\\alpha\\rangle\\langle\\alpha|-|\\beta\\rangle\\langle\\beta|\\right),\n$$\nwith $g>0$ and $A>0$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the stroboscopic dynamics of a driven-dissipative quantum many-body system near a period-doubling transition, culminating in the finite-size scaling of the time-crystalline order parameter.\n\nFirst, we justify the given normal form of the stroboscopic map for the mean-field magnetization, $m_{n+1}=F(m_n)$. The system is described by a Floquet channel $\\mathcal{E}$ that is composed of a unitary rotation and a dissipative evolution. The problem states that the dissipative dynamics possesses a global $Z_{2}$ symmetry corresponding to a flip of the magnetization along the $z$-axis. The unitary part, $U=\\exp\\!\\big(-\\mathrm{i}\\,(\\pi+\\epsilon)\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\sigma^{x}_{j}/2\\big)$, is generated by $\\sum_j \\sigma_j^x$, which is also invariant under this $Z_{2}$ symmetry (implemented by the operator $\\prod_j \\sigma_j^z$). Consequently, the full Floquet channel $\\mathcal{E}$ is $Z_{2}$-symmetric.\n\nIn the mean-field description, the state of the system is characterized by the per-spin magnetization $m = \\tfrac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\langle\\sigma^{z}_{j}\\rangle$. The $Z_{2}$ symmetry operation maps a state with magnetization $m$ to a state with magnetization $-m$. Due to the symmetry of the evolution, if $m_{n+1} = F(m_n)$, then it must be that $-m_{n+1} = F(-m_n)$. This implies that the map $F$ must be an odd function, i.e., $F(-m) = -F(m)$.\n\nAssuming analyticity, the function $F(m)$ can be expanded in a Taylor series around $m=0$. The odd-function property requires that all coefficients of even powers of $m$ must be zero. Therefore, the expansion must take the form $F(m) = c_1 m + c_3 m^3 + c_5 m^5 + \\dots$. The problem provides the map truncated at the leading nonlinear order:\n$$m_{n+1} = -a(N)\\,m_{n}-b(N)\\,m_{n}^{3}+\\mathcal{O}(m_{n}^{5})$$\nThis form is consistent with the symmetry argument, with $c_1 = -a(N)$ and $c_3 = -b(N)$. The negative sign of the linear term is physically motivated by the unitary rotation $U$, which for $\\epsilon=0$ is a perfect $\\pi$-pulse that flips the spins, $m \\to -m$. The deviation from a perfect flip (due to $\\epsilon \\neq 0$ and the dissipative part) results in $a(N)$ being close to, but not exactly, $1$.\n\nNext, we identify the period-$2T$ attractor of this map. This corresponds to a period-doubling (or flip) bifurcation. The trivial fixed point is $m=0$. Its stability is determined by the multiplier $\\lambda = F'(0) = -a(N)$. The fixed point becomes unstable when $|\\lambda|>1$, which, given $a(N)>0$, means $a(N)>1$. When this occurs, a stable period-$2$ cycle emerges.\n\nLet the points of the period-$2$ cycle be $m_A$ and $m_B$. They satisfy $m_B = F(m_A)$ and $m_A = F(m_B)$. Given the odd symmetry of $F(m)$, the emerging cycle is symmetric, i.e., $m_B = -m_A$. Let us denote the cycle points by $\\{m_*, -m_*\\}$. For this to be a solution to the dynamics, we must have $F(m_*) = -m_*$. Substituting this into the map equation:\n$$-m_* = -a(N)m_* - b(N)m_*^3$$\nWe seek the non-trivial solution where $m_* \\neq 0$. We can divide the equation by $-m_*$:\n$$1 = a(N) + b(N)m_*^2$$\nSolving for $m_*^2$, we get:\n$$m_*^2 = \\frac{1-a(N)}{-b(N)} = \\frac{a(N)-1}{b(N)}$$\nA real solution for $m_*$ exists if and only if $a(N) > 1$. The points of the period-$2T$ attractor are therefore given by $m_{\\pm} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{a(N)-1}{b(N)}}$.\n\nNow we compute the time-crystalline order parameter $\\mathcal{O}_N$:\n$$\\mathcal{O}_{N} \\equiv \\lim_{M\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{M}\\left|\\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} m_{n}\\,\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\pi n)\\right| = \\lim_{M\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{M}\\left|\\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} (-1)^n m_{n}\\right|$$\nAfter a transient time, the system settles into the period-$2$ attractor. The stroboscopic magnetization sequence becomes $m_n \\approx \\pm m_*$ for even $n$ and $m_n \\approx \\mp m_*$ for odd $n$. We can write this asymptotic behavior as $m_n \\approx m_* (-1)^n$ (the overall sign does not matter due to the absolute value in the definition of $\\mathcal{O}_N$).\nSubstituting this into the sum:\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} (-1)^n m_{n} \\approx \\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} (-1)^n \\left(m_* (-1)^n\\right) = \\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} m_* = M m_*$$\nThe contribution from the initial transient dynamics becomes negligible in the limit $M\\to\\infty$. Therefore,\n$$\\mathcal{O}_N = \\lim_{M\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{M}\\left|M m_*\\right| = |m_*|$$\nBy convention, we take $m_*$ to be the positive root, so $\\mathcal{O}_N = m_*$. We find that the order parameter is equal to the amplitude of the period-$2$ oscillation:\n$$\\mathcal{O}_N = \\sqrt{\\frac{a(N)-1}{b(N)}}$$\nFinally, we determine the finite-size scaling of $\\mathcal{O}_N$ using the provided large-$N$ expansions.

This entails substituting the leading terms of the expansions for $a(N)-1$ and $b(N)$ into the formula for $\\mathcal{O}_N$. The existence of the attractor requires $a(N)-1 > 0$, i.e., $\\delta - c/N > 0$.\n$$\\mathcal{O}_N^2 = \\frac{a(N)-1}{b(N)} = \\frac{\\delta-\\frac{c}{N}+\\mathcal{O}(N^{-2})}{b_0+\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1})}$$\nTo leading order, we neglect the $\\mathcal{O}(\\dots)$ terms:\n$$\\mathcal{O}_N^2 \\approx \\frac{\\delta-\\frac{c}{N}}{b_0}$$\nTaking the square root gives the final expression for the order parameter:\n$$\\mathcal{O}_N = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta-\\frac{c}{N}}{b_0}}$$\nThis can be rewritten to combine the terms in the numerator:\n$$\\mathcal{O}_N = \\sqrt{\\frac{N\\delta - c}{N b_0}}$$\nThis expression captures the finite-size scaling of the order parameter near the critical point. In the thermodynamic limit $N\\to\\infty$, $\\mathcal{O}_N \\to \\sqrt{\\delta/b_0}$, which is the standard mean-field result for the order parameter amplitude above a supercritical period-doubling bifurcation.
