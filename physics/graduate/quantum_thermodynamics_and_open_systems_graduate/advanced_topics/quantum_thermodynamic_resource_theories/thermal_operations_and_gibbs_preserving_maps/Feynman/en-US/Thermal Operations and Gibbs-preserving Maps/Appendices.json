The qubit is weakly coupled to a large thermal reservoir at inverse temperature $\\beta$ through a system operator $S=\\sigma_{x}$, where $\\sigma_{x}$ is the Pauli-$x$ matrix, and the reservoir coupling is stationary and satisfies the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) detailed-balance condition. In the weak-coupling, Born-Markov, and secular (rotating-wave) limits, the dynamics of the reduced system is generated by a Davies generator, which is a Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan (GKLS) generator with jump operators equal to the energy eigenoperators $A(\\omega)$ of $S$ with respect to $H$. The Bohr frequencies of the system are $\\pm \\omega$, and the corresponding jump operators are $A(\\omega)=\\sigma_{-}$ and $A(-\\omega)=\\sigma_{+}$, where $\\sigma_{-}=\\lvert g\\rangle\\langle e\\rangle$ and $\\sigma_{+}=\\lvert e\\rangle\\langle g\\rangle$.

The concepts of the Davies generator, Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan (GKLS) master equation, Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition, and Gibbs state are all standard and fundamental to the field.

It is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution\nThe system Hamiltonian is given by $H=\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\sigma_{z}$. In the basis $\\{|e\\rangle, |g\\rangle\\}$, where $|e\\rangle$ is the excited state and $|g\\rangle$ is the ground state, $\\sigma_z = |e\\rangle\\langle e| - |g\\rangle\\langle g|$. The corresponding energy eigenvalues are $E_e = \\frac{\\omega}{2}$ and $E_g = -\\frac{\\omega}{2}$. The energy gap is $E_e - E_g = \\omega$.\n\nThe dynamics are described by a GKLS master equation with jump operators derived from the system-bath coupling. The problem specifies these jump operators and their associated rates.\n\n**1. Derivation of Transition Rates $\\gamma_{\\downarrow}$ and $\\gamma_{\\uparrow}$**\n\nThe jump operator $\\sigma_{-} = |g\\rangle\\langle e|$ describes a transition from the excited state $|e\\rangle$ to the ground state $|g\\rangle$. This is a downward transition, corresponding to energy relaxation. The associated Bohr frequency is $\\nu = E_e - E_g = \\omega$. The problem states that the jump operator for this frequency is $A(\\omega) = \\sigma_{-}$ and the corresponding rate is $\\gamma(\\omega)$. Therefore, the downward transition rate $\\gamma_{\\downarrow}$ is:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\downarrow} = \\gamma(\\omega)\n$$\nWe are given the definition $\\gamma(\\omega) = \\Gamma$. Thus,\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\downarrow} = \\Gamma\n$$\n\nThe jump operator $\\sigma_{+} = |e\\rangle\\langle g|$ describes a transition from the ground state $|g\\rangle$ to the excited state $|e\\rangle$. This is an upward transition, corresponding to thermal excitation. The associated Bohr frequency is $\\nu = E_g - E_e = -\\omega$. The problem states that the jump operator for this frequency is $A(-\\omega) = \\sigma_{+}$ and the corresponding rate is $\\gamma(-\\omega)$. Therefore, the upward transition rate $\\gamma_{\\uparrow}$ is:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\uparrow} = \\gamma(-\\omega)\n$$\nUsing the provided Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition, $\\gamma(-\\omega) = \\exp(-\\beta \\omega) \\gamma(\\omega)$, we can express $\\gamma_{\\uparrow}$ in terms of $\\Gamma$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\uparrow} = \\exp(-\\beta \\omega) \\gamma(\\omega) = \\Gamma \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of Stationary Populations $p_e$ and $p_g$**\n\nIn the secular approximation, the dynamics of the populations of the energy eigenstates, $p_e = \\langle e|\\rho|e \\rangle$ and $p_g = \\langle g|\\rho|g \\rangle$, are governed by a classical rate equation (Pauli master equation). The rate of change of the excited state population, $\\frac{dp_e}{dt}$, is given by the rate of transitions into state $|e\\rangle$ minus the rate of transitions out of state $|e\\rangle$.\n$$\n\\frac{dp_e}{dt} = (\\text{flux from } |g\\rangle \\text{ to } |e\\rangle) - (\\text{flux from } |e\\rangle \\text{ to } |g\\rangle)\n$$\nThis is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{dp_e}{dt} = \\gamma_{\\uparrow} p_g - \\gamma_{\\downarrow} p_e\n$$\nThe stationary state is achieved when the populations no longer change, i.e., $\\frac{dp_e}{dt} = 0$. This implies the condition of detailed balance:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\uparrow} p_g = \\gamma_{\\downarrow} p_e\n$$\nWe also use the normalization condition $p_e + p_g = 1$, which implies $p_g = 1 - p_e$. Substituting this into the detailed balance equation:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\uparrow} (1 - p_e) = \\gamma_{\\downarrow} p_e\n$$\nSolving for $p_e$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\uparrow} - \\gamma_{\\uparrow} p_e = \\gamma_{\\downarrow} p_e\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\uparrow} = (\\gamma_{\\downarrow} + \\gamma_{\\uparrow}) p_e\n$$\n$$\np_e = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\uparrow}}{\\gamma_{\\downarrow} + \\gamma_{\\uparrow}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\gamma_{\\downarrow}$ and $\\gamma_{\\uparrow}$:\n$$\np_e = \\frac{\\Gamma \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}{\\Gamma + \\Gamma \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)} = \\frac{\\Gamma \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}{\\Gamma(1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega))} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}\n$$\nThe stationary ground state population $p_g$ is then found from $p_g = 1 - p_e$:\n$$\np_g = 1 - \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)} = \\frac{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega) - \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}\n$$\n\n**3. Confirmation via the Gibbs State**\n\nThe problem states that the derivation can be performed using the definition of the Gibbs state, which is the unique stationary state of the Davies generator. The Gibbs state is $\\rho_{\\beta} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta H)}{Z}$, where $Z = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta H)]$ is the partition function.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is $H = \\frac{\\omega}{2}\\sigma_z$, with eigenvalues $E_e = \\frac{\\omega}{2}$ and $E_g = -\\frac{\\omega}{2}$.\nThe partition function $Z$ is:\n$$\nZ = \\exp(-\\beta E_e) + \\exp(-\\beta E_g) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe stationary populations are the diagonal elements of $\\rho_{\\beta}$ in the energy eigenbasis:\n$$\np_e = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_e)}{Z} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression and match the previous result, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)$:\n$$\np_e = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)}{\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta\\omega)}\n$$\nFor the ground state population:\n$$\np_g = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_g)}{Z} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)}\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)$:\n$$\np_g = \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)}{\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\omega}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta\\omega)}\n$$\nBoth methods yield identical results, confirming the correctness of the derivation.\n\nThe four requested quantities are:\n- $\\gamma_{\\downarrow} = \\Gamma$\n- $\\gamma_{\\uparrow} = \\Gamma \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)$\n- $p_{e} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}$\n- $p_{g} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}$",

Explain how high-energy population differences can lead to different orderings for $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ at this $\\beta$.\n\n3. Using the thermo-majorization curves for $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ at $\\beta\\epsilon=\\tfrac{1}{2}$, evaluate the vertical gap $D$ between the two curves at the abscissa $X=\\exp(-\\beta E_2)$. Define $D$ as $D=Y_{\\sigma}(X)-Y_{\\rho}(X)$ at that $X$. A strictly positive $D$ certifies that $\\rho$ does not thermo-majorize $\\sigma$ at this temperature.\n\nCompute the numerical value of $D$ and round your final answer to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a three-part analysis of two quantum states, $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$, within the framework of quantum thermodynamics, specifically focusing on majorization and thermo-majorization. We will address each part sequentially based on the foundational definitions.\n\nThe system is a three-level quantum system with energy eigenvalues $E_0=0$, $E_1=\\epsilon$, and $E_2=3\\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon>0$. The states $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ are diagonal in the energy eigenbasis, with population vectors $p=(p_0,p_1,p_2)=(0.6,0.3,0.1)$ and $q=(q_0,q_1,q_2)=(0.55,0.2,0.25)$, respectively. The analysis is to be performed at an inverse temperature $\\beta$ such that $\\beta\\epsilon=\\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n\n### Part 1: Majorization\n\nMajorization is a preorder on probability vectors. For two vectors $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ that sum to $1$, $x$ is said to majorize $y$, denoted $x \\succ y$, if the sum of the $k$ largest components of $x$ is greater than or equal to the sum of the $k$ largest components of $y$, for all $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, d-1\\}$, with equality holding for $k=d$.\n\nLet $x^\\downarrow$ denote the vector $x$ with its components sorted in descending order. The condition for $p \\succ q$ is $\\sum_{i=1}^k p_i^\\downarrow \\ge \\sum_{i=1}^k q_i^\\downarrow$ for $k=1, 2$, and $\\sum_{i=1}^3 p_i^\\downarrow = \\sum_{i=1}^3 q_i^\\downarrow$.\n\nThe given population vectors are $p=(0.6, 0.3, 0.1)$ and $q=(0.55, 0.2, 0.25)$.\nFirst, we sort their components in descending order:\n$p^\\downarrow = (0.6, 0.3, 0.1)$\n$q^\\downarrow = (0.55, 0.25, 0.2)$\n\nNow, we check the cumulative sums:\nFor $k=1$:\n$p_1^\\downarrow = 0.6$\n$q_1^\\downarrow = 0.55$\nThe condition $0.6 \\ge 0.55$ is satisfied.\n\nFor $k=2$:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^2 p_i^\\downarrow = 0.6 + 0.3 = 0.9$\n$\\sum_{i=1}^2 q_i^\\downarrow = 0.55 + 0.25 = 0.8$\nThe condition $0.9 \\ge 0.8$ is satisfied.\n\nFor $k=3$:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^3 p_i^\\downarrow = 0.6 + 0.3 + 0.1 = 1.0$\n$\\sum_{i=1}^3 q_i^\\downarrow = 0.55 + 0.25 + 0.2 = 1.0$\nThe equality holds.\n\nSince all conditions are met, we conclude that the population vector $p$ majorizes $q$, i.e., $p \\succ q$.\n\n### Part 2: Thermo-majorization Curve Construction\n\nThermo-majorization extends the concept of majorization to account for energy constraints imposed by a thermal bath. The thermo-majorization curve for a state with populations $p_i$ at energies $E_i$ is constructed by ordering the energy levels according to the decreasing value of the rescaled populations $p_i / \\exp(-\\beta E_i)$. Let this ordered sequence of indices be $j_0, j_1, j_2$. The vertices of the piecewise-linear curve are $(X_k, Y_k)$ for $k=0,1,2,3$, where $(X_0, Y_0) = (0,0)$ and for $k>0$:\n$$X_k = \\sum_{m=0}^{k-1} \\exp(-\\beta E_{j_m})$$\n$$Y_k = \\sum_{m=0}^{k-1} p_{j_m}$$\n\nWe are given $\\beta\\epsilon = \\tfrac{1}{2}$. The Boltzmann factors $Z_i = \\exp(-\\beta E_i)$ are:\n$Z_0 = \\exp(-\\beta E_0) = \\exp(0) = 1$\n$Z_1 = \\exp(-\\beta E_1) = \\exp(-\\beta\\epsilon) = \\exp(-\\tfrac{1}{2})$\n$Z_2 = \\exp(-\\beta E_2) = \\exp(-3\\beta\\epsilon) = \\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2})$\n\nFor state $\\rho$ with $p=(0.6, 0.3, 0.1)$:\nThe rescaled populations are $p_i/Z_i$:\n$p_0/Z_0 = 0.6 / 1 = 0.6$\n$p_1/Z_1 = 0.3 / \\exp(-\\tfrac{1}{2}) = 0.3 \\exp(\\tfrac{1}{2}) \\approx 0.3 \\times 1.6487 = 0.49461$\n$p_2/Z_2 = 0.1 / \\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2}) = 0.1 \\exp(\\tfrac{3}{2}) \\approx 0.1 \\times 4.4817 = 0.44817$\nThe descending order of these values is for $i=0, 1, 2$. So the ordering of indices for $\\rho$ is $(0, 1, 2)$.\n\nFor state $\\sigma$ with $q=(0.55, 0.2, 0.25)$:\nThe rescaled populations are $q_i/Z_i$:\n$q_0/Z_0 = 0.55 / 1 = 0.55$\n$q_1/Z_1 = 0.2 / \\exp(-\\tfrac{1}{2}) = 0.2 \\exp(\\tfrac{1}{2}) \\approx 0.2 \\times 1.6487 = 0.32974$\n$q_2/Z_2 = 0.25 / \\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2}) = 0.25 \\exp(\\tfrac{3}{2}) \\approx 0.25 \\times 4.4817 = 1.120425$\nThe descending order of these values corresponds to the indices $i=2, 0, 1$. So the ordering of indices for $\\sigma$ is $(2, 0, 1)$.\n\nThe different orderings arise because of the population distribution relative to the energy levels. State $\\rho$ has populations that decrease with energy, a property typical of thermal-like states. The rescaling by $1/Z_i = \\exp(\\beta E_i)$ does not alter this \"natural\" order. In contrast, state $\\sigma$ exhibits a form of population inversion, where the population of the highest energy level ($q_2=0.25$) is greater than that of the intermediate level ($q_1=0.2$). The rescaled population $q_i/Z_i$ is weighted by the factor $\\exp(\\beta E_i)$, which heavily amplifies populations at high energies. For state $\\sigma$, the relatively large population $q_2$ at the high energy $E_2$ results in $q_2/Z_2$ becoming the dominant term, thus changing the ordering. This reordering is a signature of an \"athermal\" resource present in the state $\\sigma$.\n\n### Part 3: Gap Calculation\n\nWe now construct the corner points of the thermo-majorization curves $T_\\rho$ and $T_\\sigma$.\n\nFor $T_\\rho$, the ordering is $(0, 1, 2)$. The points $(X_k, Y_k)$ are:\n$(X_0, Y_0) = (0, 0)$\n$(X_1, Y_1) = (Z_0, p_0) = (1, 0.6)$\n$(X_2, Y_2) = (Z_0+Z_1, p_0+p_1) = (1+\\exp(-\\tfrac{1}{2}), 0.9)$\n$(X_3, Y_3) = (Z_0+Z_1+Z_2, p_0+p_1+p_2) = (1+\\exp(-\\tfrac{1}{2})+\\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2}), 1.0)$\n\nFor $T_\\sigma$, the ordering is $(2, 0, 1)$. The points $(X_k, Y_k)$ are:\n$(X_0, Y_0) = (0, 0)$\n$(X_1, Y_1) = (Z_2, q_2) = (\\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2}), 0.25)$\n$(X_2, Y_2) = (Z_2+Z_0, q_2+q_0) = (\\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2})+1, 0.25+0.55) = (\\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2})+1, 0.8)$\n$(X_3, Y_3) = (Z_2+Z_0+Z_1, q_2+q_0+q_1) = (\\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2})+1+\\exp(-\\tfrac{1}{2}), 1.0)$\n\nWe need to calculate the gap $D = Y_{\\sigma}(X) - Y_{\\rho}(X)$ at the abscissa $X = \\exp(-\\beta E_2) = \\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2})$.\n\nFirst, we find $Y_{\\sigma}(X)$. The point $X = \\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2})$ is the abscissa of the first corner of the $T_\\sigma$ curve. Thus, the value of the function at this point is simply the ordinate of that corner:\n$Y_{\\sigma}(\\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2})) = 0.25$.\n\nNext, we find $Y_{\\rho}(X)$. The point $X = \\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2})$ lies on the first line segment of the $T_\\rho$ curve, which connects $(0,0)$ to $(1, 0.6)$. We confirm that $0 < \\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2}) < 1$. The equation for this segment is $Y(x) = m x$, with slope $m = \\frac{0.6-0}{1-0} = 0.6$.\nSo, for $x \\in [0, 1]$, $Y_\\rho(x) = 0.6x$. Evaluating at $X$:\n$Y_{\\rho}(\\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2})) = 0.6 \\times \\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2})$.\n\nThe gap $D$ is the difference:\n$D = 0.25 - 0.6 \\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2})$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.\n$\\exp(-\\tfrac{3}{2}) = \\exp(-1.5) \\approx 0.22313016$\n$D \\approx 0.25 - 0.6 \\times 0.22313016$\n$D \\approx 0.25 - 0.13387810$\n$D \\approx 0.1161219$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $D = 0.1161$. Since $D > 0$, the curve for $\\sigma$ lies above the curve for $\\rho$ at this point, which proves that $\\rho$ does not thermo-majorize $\\sigma$ at this temperature.",
