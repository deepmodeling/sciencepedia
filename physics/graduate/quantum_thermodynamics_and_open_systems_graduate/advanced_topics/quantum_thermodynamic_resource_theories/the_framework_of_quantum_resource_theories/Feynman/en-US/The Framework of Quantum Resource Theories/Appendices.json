The definitions of free states, the dephasing map as a free operation, and the properties of a resource witness are all standard. The condition $\\mathrm{Tr}[W\\Delta(\\rho)] \\ge 0$ for all states $\\rho$ is equivalent to condition (i), since the set of all dephased states, $\\{\\Delta(\\rho)\\}$, is precisely the set of all free (diagonal) states. The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and mathematically solvable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nA general Hermitian operator for a single qubit can be written in the computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$ as:\n$$\nW = \\begin{pmatrix} w_{00} & w_{01} \\\\ w_{10} & w_{11} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $w_{00}, w_{11} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $w_{10} = w_{01}^*$ due to the hermiticity condition $W = W^\\dagger$.\n\nThe problem states that the witness $W$ must satisfy $\\mathrm{Tr}[W\\Delta(\\rho)] \\ge 0$ for any qubit density operator $\\rho$. Let's first analyze the action of the dephasing map $\\Delta$. For a general density operator $\\rho$,\n$$\n\\rho = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{00} & \\rho_{01} \\\\ \\rho_{10} & \\rho_{11} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nthe dephasing map $\\Delta$ is defined as $\\Delta(\\rho) = \\sum_{i=0}^{1}|i\\rangle\\langle i|\\rho|i\\rangle\\langle i|$. This can be calculated as:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\rho) = |0\\rangle\\langle 0| \\rho |0\\rangle\\langle 0| + |1\\rangle\\langle 1| \\rho |1\\rangle\\langle 1| = \\rho_{00}|0\\rangle\\langle 0| + \\rho_{11}|1\\rangle\\langle 1|\n$$\nIn matrix form, this is:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\rho) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{00} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\rho_{11} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the trace condition:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}[W\\Delta(\\rho)] = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} w_{00} & w_{01} \\\\ w_{10} & w_{11} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{00} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\rho_{11} \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} w_{00}\\rho_{00} & w_{01}\\rho_{11} \\\\ w_{10}\\rho_{00} & w_{11}\\rho_{11} \\end{pmatrix} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}[W\\Delta(\\rho)] = w_{00}\\rho_{00} + w_{11}\\rho_{11}\n$$\nThis inequality, $w_{00}\\rho_{00} + w_{11}\\rho_{11} \\ge 0$, must hold for the diagonal elements of any valid density matrix $\\rho$. The diagonal elements of a density matrix satisfy $\\rho_{00} \\ge 0$, $\\rho_{11} \\ge 0$, and $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho) = \\rho_{00}+\\rho_{11} = 1$.\n\nLet $\\rho_{00} = p$, which implies $\\rho_{11} = 1-p$, for $p \\in [0, 1]$. The condition becomes $w_{00}p + w_{11}(1-p) \\ge 0$ for all $p \\in [0, 1]$. This is a linear function of $p$. For it to be non-negative over the interval, it must be non-negative at the endpoints of the interval.\n- For $p=1$ (corresponding to the state $\\rho=|0\\rangle\\langle 0|$), we must have $w_{00}(1) + w_{11}(0) \\ge 0$, which implies $w_{00} \\ge 0$.\n- For $p=0$ (corresponding to the state $\\rho=|1\\rangle\\langle 1|$), we must have $w_{00}(0) + w_{11}(1) \\ge 0$, which implies $w_{11} \\ge 0$.\n\nThus, the first property of a coherence witness imposes the constraints that the diagonal elements of $W$ must be non-negative:\n$$\nw_{00} \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad w_{11} \\ge 0\n$$\nThe off-diagonal elements $w_{01}$ and $w_{10}$ are not constrained by this property.\n\nNext, we must use the second property to construct a nontrivial witness. There must exist a coherent state $\\sigma$ such that $\\mathrm{Tr}[W\\sigma] < 0$. A nontrivial witness is one which is not a positive semidefinite operator, meaning it must have at least one negative eigenvalue.\n\nLet's choose a maximally coherent pure state, such as $|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$. The corresponding density matrix is $\\sigma = |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|$:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we compute $\\mathrm{Tr}[W\\sigma]$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}[W\\sigma] = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} w_{00} & w_{01} \\\\ w_{10} & w_{11} \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} w_{00}+w_{01} & w_{00}+w_{01} \\\\ w_{10}+w_{11} & w_{10}+w_{11} \\end{pmatrix} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}[W\\sigma] = \\frac{1}{2}(w_{00}+w_{01} + w_{10}+w_{11})\n$$\nSince $w_{10} = w_{01}^*$, we have $w_{01} + w_{10} = w_{01} + w_{01}^* = 2\\mathrm{Re}(w_{01})$. So, the condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(w_{00} + w_{11} + 2\\mathrm{Re}(w_{01})) < 0 \\implies w_{00} + w_{11} + 2\\mathrm{Re}(w_{01}) < 0\n$$\nTo construct a witness $W$, we need to choose values for its elements that satisfy all constraints:\n1. $W$ is Hermitian ($w_{10}=w_{01}^*$).\n2. $w_{00} \\ge 0, w_{11} \\ge 0$.\n3. $w_{00} + w_{11} + 2\\mathrm{Re}(w_{01}) < 0$.\n\nLet's make a simple choice. To satisfy the third inequality, $\\mathrm{Re}(w_{01})$ must be negative and sufficiently large in magnitude. Let's choose $w_{01}$ to be a negative real number, for instance, $w_{01} = -1$.\nSince $w_{01}$ is real, $w_{10} = w_{01} = -1$. So $\\mathrm{Re}(w_{01}) = -1$.\nThe inequality becomes $w_{00} + w_{11} - 2 < 0$, or $w_{00} + w_{11} < 2$.\nWe can satisfy this and $w_{00} \\ge 0, w_{11} \\ge 0$ with many choices. A particularly simple choice is $w_{00} = 0$ and $w_{11} = 0$. This gives $0+0 < 2$, which is true.\n\nThis set of choices leads to the following witness operator:\n$$\nW = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the negative of the Pauli-X matrix, $W = -\\sigma_x$.\n\nLet's verify this operator $W$:\n- It is Hermitian, as it is a real symmetric matrix.\n- Its diagonal elements are $w_{00}=0$ and $w_{11}=0$, which are non-negative. This ensures $\\mathrm{Tr}[W\\Delta(\\rho)] = 0 \\ge 0$ for any state $\\rho$.\n- For the coherent state $\\sigma = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, we have:\n  $$\n  \\mathrm{Tr}[W\\sigma] = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}(-1-1) = -1\n  $$\nSince $\\mathrm{Tr}[W\\sigma] = -1 < 0$, this operator successfully detects the coherence in state $\\sigma$. The eigenvalues of this $W$ are $\\pm 1$, and the negative eigenvalue confirms it is a nontrivial witness.\nThus, this is a valid construction.",

The tasks are specific and follow logically from the provided definitions. There are no scientific or logical contradictions, no missing information, and no subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: deriving the system's Gibbs state $\\gamma$, computing the trace distance $D(\\Phi(\\gamma),\\gamma)$, and analyzing if $\\Phi$ can be a thermal operation.\n\nFirst, we derive the Gibbs state $\\gamma$ of the system. The system Hamiltonian is given in the energy eigenbasis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle, |2\\rangle\\}$ as the diagonal matrix $H_{S}=\\mathrm{diag}(E_0, E_1, E_2)$ with eigenvalues $E_0=0$, $E_1=\\epsilon$, and $E_2=2\\epsilon$.\nThe Gibbs state is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{Z_S}\\exp(-\\beta H_S)$, where $Z_S$ is the partition function.\nWe compute the matrix exponential:\n$$\n\\exp(-\\beta H_S) = \\mathrm{diag}(\\exp(-\\beta E_0), \\exp(-\\beta E_1), \\exp(-\\beta E_2)) = \\mathrm{diag}(\\exp(0), \\exp(-\\beta\\epsilon), \\exp(-2\\beta\\epsilon))\n$$\nUsing the given condition $\\beta\\epsilon=1$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\exp(-\\beta H_S) = \\mathrm{diag}(1, \\exp(-1), \\exp(-2))\n$$\nThe partition function $Z_S$ is the trace of this matrix:\n$$\nZ_S = \\mathrm{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta H_S)] = 1 + \\exp(-1) + \\exp(-2)\n$$\nTherefore, the Gibbs state of the system is the density matrix:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-1} + e^{-2}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & e^{-1} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & e^{-2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIn terms of projectors onto the energy eigenstates, $\\gamma = p_0|0\\rangle\\langle0| + p_1|1\\rangle\\langle1| + p_2|2\\rangle\\langle2|$, where $p_0 = \\frac{1}{Z_S}$, $p_1 = \\frac{e^{-1}}{Z_S}$, and $p_2 = \\frac{e^{-2}}{Z_S}$.\n\nNext, we compute $D(\\Phi(\\gamma),\\gamma)$. The map $\\Phi$ is defined to permute the excited energy levels, meaning it swaps the corresponding projectors $|1\\rangle\\langle1|$ and $|2\\rangle\\langle2|$, while leaving the ground state projector $|0\\rangle\\langle0|$ unchanged. The action of $\\Phi$ on the Gibbs state $\\gamma$ is:\n$$\n\\Phi(\\gamma) = \\Phi(p_0|0\\rangle\\langle0| + p_1|1\\rangle\\langle1| + p_2|2\\rangle\\langle2|) = p_0\\Phi(|0\\rangle\\langle0|) + p_1\\Phi(|1\\rangle\\langle1|) + p_2\\Phi(|2\\rangle\\langle2|)\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi(\\gamma) = p_0|0\\rangle\\langle0| + p_1|2\\rangle\\langle2| + p_2|1\\rangle\\langle1|\n$$\nThis corresponds to swapping the populations of the first and second excited states. The resulting density matrix is:\n$$\n\\Phi(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-1} + e^{-2}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & e^{-2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & e^{-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we find the difference between $\\Phi(\\gamma)$ and $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\Phi(\\gamma) - \\gamma = \\frac{1}{Z_S}\n\\left(\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & e^{-2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & e^{-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n-\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & e^{-1} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & e^{-2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\right)\n= \\frac{1}{Z_S}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & e^{-2} - e^{-1} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & e^{-1} - e^{-2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe trace distance is $D(\\Phi(\\gamma),\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\Phi(\\gamma)-\\gamma\\|_{1}$. The trace norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_1$ of a Hermitian matrix is the sum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of $\\Phi(\\gamma) - \\gamma$ are its diagonal entries: $0$, $\\frac{e^{-2}-e^{-1}}{Z_S}$, and $\\frac{e^{-1}-e^{-2}}{Z_S}$.\n$$\n\\|\\Phi(\\gamma)-\\gamma\\|_{1} = \\left|0\\right| + \\frac{|e^{-2} - e^{-1}|}{Z_S} + \\frac{|e^{-1} - e^{-2}|}{Z_S}\n$$\nSince $e>1$, we have $e^{-1} > e^{-2}$, so $e^{-1}-e^{-2} > 0$. The trace norm is:\n$$\n\\|\\Phi(\\gamma)-\\gamma\\|_{1} = \\frac{e^{-1} - e^{-2}}{Z_S} + \\frac{e^{-1} - e^{-2}}{Z_S} = \\frac{2(e^{-1} - e^{-2})}{Z_S}\n$$\nThe trace distance is therefore:\n$$\nD(\\Phi(\\gamma),\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2(e^{-1} - e^{-2})}{Z_S} = \\frac{e^{-1} - e^{-2}}{1 + e^{-1} + e^{-2}}\n$$\nTo obtain a cleaner expression, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $e^2$:\n$$\nD(\\Phi(\\gamma),\\gamma) = \\frac{e^2(e^{-1} - e^{-2})}{e^2(1 + e^{-1} + e^{-2})} = \\frac{e - 1}{e^2 + e + 1}\n$$\n\nFinally, we argue whether $\\Phi$ can be a thermal operation. According to the definition, a thermal operation $\\mathcal{E}$ on a system $S$ is of the form $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_S) = \\mathrm{Tr}_B[U(\\rho_S \\otimes \\gamma_B)U^\\dagger]$, where $\\gamma_B = \\exp(-\\beta H_B)/Z_B$ is the Gibbs state of the bath and the unitary $U$ conserves total energy, $[U, H_S + H_B] = 0$.\n\nA fundamental property of thermal operations is that they must leave the system's own Gibbs state invariant. To show this, consider the action of a thermal operation $\\mathcal{E}$ on the system's Gibbs state $\\gamma = \\exp(-\\beta H_S)/Z_S$. The initial state of the joint system is $\\gamma \\otimes \\gamma_B$. This state can be written as:\n$$\n\\gamma \\otimes \\gamma_B = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta H_S)}{Z_S} \\otimes \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta H_B)}{Z_B} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta(H_S+H_B))}{Z_S Z_B}\n$$\nThis is the Gibbs state for the total system $S+B$. The energy conservation condition $[U, H_S + H_B] = 0$ implies that $U$ commutes with any function of the total Hamiltonian, including the total Gibbs state. Thus, $[U, \\gamma \\otimes \\gamma_B] = 0$.\nThe evolution of the total state is trivial:\n$$\nU(\\gamma \\otimes \\gamma_B)U^\\dagger = U U^\\dagger (\\gamma \\otimes \\gamma_B) = \\gamma \\otimes \\gamma_B\n$$\nTracing out the bath to find the final state of the system yields:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}(\\gamma) = \\mathrm{Tr}_B[\\gamma \\otimes \\gamma_B] = \\gamma \\cdot \\mathrm{Tr}_B[\\gamma_B] = \\gamma\n$$\nThis proves that the Gibbs state $\\gamma$ must be a fixed point for any thermal operation $\\mathcal{E}$; i.e., $\\mathcal{E}(\\gamma) = \\gamma$.\n\nIn our case, the map is $\\Phi$. We have already calculated $\\gamma$ and $\\Phi(\\gamma)$. We see that $\\Phi(\\gamma) = \\gamma$ if and only if the populations are equal, i.e., $p_1 = p_2$. The populations are $p_1 = e^{-1}/Z_S$ and $p_2 = e^{-2}/Z_S$. Since $e^{-1} \\neq e^{-2}$, we have $p_1 \\neq p_2$, and thus $\\Phi(\\gamma) \\neq \\gamma$.\nThe fact that we calculated a non-zero trace distance, $D(\\Phi(\\gamma),\\gamma) = \\frac{e-1}{e^2+e+1} > 0$, is the quantitative confirmation that $\\Phi(\\gamma) \\neq \\gamma$.\nSince $\\Phi$ does not preserve the Gibbs state, it violates a necessary condition for all thermal operations. Therefore, $\\Phi$ cannot be a thermal operation.",

The Lorenz curve is a piecewise linear function connecting the points $(\\sum_{j=1}^k g_{\\pi(j)}, \\sum_{j=1}^k p_{\\pi(j)})$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the system (here, $d=2$). For $k=0$, the point is $(0,0)$. For $k=d$, the point is $(1,1)$.\n\nThe transition $\\rho_1 \\to \\rho_2$ is possible if and only if the Lorenz curve of $\\rho_1$ lies everywhere above or on the Lorenz curve of $\\rho_2$.\n\nLet's compute the ratios $c_i$ for $\\rho_1$ and $\\rho_2$. Let $x = \\exp(\\beta\\epsilon)$. Since $\\beta>0, \\epsilon>0$, we have $x>1$.\nFor $\\rho_1$:\n$c_0^{(1)} = p_0 / g_0 = 0.6(1 + \\exp(-\\beta\\epsilon)) = 0.6(1+1/x)$\n$c_1^{(1)} = p_1 / g_1 = 0.4 / \\exp(-\\beta\\epsilon) \\cdot (1 + \\exp(-\\beta\\epsilon)) = 0.4x(1+1/x) = 0.4(x+1)$\nThe ordering depends on the comparison of $c_0^{(1)}$ and $c_1^{(1)}$.\n$c_1^{(1)} > c_0^{(1)} \\iff 0.4(x+1) > 0.6(1+1/x) \\iff 0.4x - 0.6/x - 0.2 > 0 \\iff 2x^2 - x - 3 > 0$.\nThe roots of $2x^2 - x - 3 = 0$ are $x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-4(2)(-3)}}{4} = \\frac{1 \\pm 5}{4}$, which gives $x=1.5$ and $x=-1$. Since $x>1$, the inequality holds for $x > 1.5$.\nSo, for $\\rho_1$, the permutation is $\\pi = (1,0)$ if $x > 1.5$ and $\\pi = (0,1)$ if $1 < x < 1.5$.\n\nFor $\\rho_2$:\n$c_0^{(2)} = q_0 / g_0 = 0.7(1 + 1/x)$\n$c_1^{(2)} = q_1 / g_1 = 0.3(x+1)$\nThe ordering depends on the comparison of $c_0^{(2)}$ and $c_1^{(2)}$.\n$c_1^{(2)} > c_0^{(2)} \\iff 0.3(x+1) > 0.7(1+1/x) \\iff 0.3x - 0.7/x - 0.4 > 0 \\iff 3x^2 - 4x - 7 > 0$.\nThe roots of $3x^2-4x-7=0$ are $x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-4(3)(-7)}}{6} = \\frac{4 \\pm 10}{6}$, which gives $x=7/3$ and $x=-1$. Since $x>1$, the inequality holds for $x > 7/3$.\nSo, for $\\rho_2$, the permutation is $\\sigma=(1,0)$ if $x > 7/3$ and $\\sigma=(0,1)$ if $1<x<7/3$.\n\nWe analyze the thermo-majorization condition in three regimes for $x = \\exp(\\beta\\epsilon)$:\n\nCase 1: $1 < x < 1.5$.\nIn this regime, $c_0^{(1)} > c_1^{(1)}$ and $c_0^{(2)} > c_1^{(2)}$. So, $\\pi=\\sigma=(0,1)$.\nThe Lorenz curve for $\\rho_1$ is connects $(0,0)$, $(g_0, p_0)$, and $(1,1)$.\nThe Lorenz curve for $\\rho_2$ is connects $(0,0)$, $(g_0, q_0)$, and $(1,1)$.\nSince the \"knee\" points have the same x-coordinate $g_0$, the condition that the curve for $\\rho_1$ is above that for $\\rho_2$ simplifies to $p_0 \\ge q_0$.\n$0.6 \\ge 0.7$ is false. The transition is not possible.\n\nCase 2: $x > 7/3$.\nIn this regime, $c_1^{(1)} > c_0^{(1)}$ and $c_1^{(2)} > c_0^{(2)}$. So, $\\pi=\\sigma=(1,0)$.\nThe Lorenz curve for $\\rho_1$ connects $(0,0)$, $(g_1, p_1)$, and $(1,1)$.\nThe Lorenz curve for $\\rho_2$ connects $(0,0)$, $(g_1, q_1)$, and $(1,1)$.\nThe condition is $p_1 \\ge q_1$.\n$0.4 \\ge 0.3$ is true. The transition is possible.\n\nCase 3: $1.5 \\le x \\le 7/3$.\nIn this regime, $c_1^{(1)} \\ge c_0^{(1)}$ and $c_0^{(2)} \\ge c_1^{(2)}$. So, $\\pi=(1,0)$ and $\\sigma=(0,1)$.\nThe Lorenz curve for $\\rho_1$, denoted $L_1(s)$, connects $(0,0)$, $(g_1, p_1)$, and $(1,1)$.\nThe Lorenz curve for $\\rho_2$, denoted $L_2(s)$, connects $(0,0)$, $(g_0, q_0)$, and $(1,1)$.\nThe condition is $L_1(s) \\ge L_2(s)$ for all $s \\in [0,1]$. Since both are convex functions from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$, this is equivalent to checking the condition at the knee points.\n1. The knee of $L_1$ must be above or on $L_2$: $L_2(g_1) \\le p_1$. The point $s=g_1$ is on the first segment of $L_2$ because $g_1 < g_0$ for $x>1$. The equation for this segment is $L_2(s)=(q_0/g_0)s$.\n$ (q_0/g_0)g_1 \\le p_1 \\implies q_0 (g_1/g_0) \\le p_1 \\implies q_0 \\exp(-\\beta\\epsilon) \\le p_1$.\n$ 0.7/x \\le 0.4 \\implies x \\ge 0.7/0.4 = 1.75$.\nSo we need $\\exp(\\beta\\epsilon) \\ge 1.75$.\n\n2. The knee of $L_2$ must be below or on $L_1$: $L_1(g_0) \\ge q_0$. The point $s=g_0$ is on the second segment of $L_1$ because $g_0 > g_1$. The equation for this segment passing through $(g_1, p_1)$ and $(1,1)$ is $y-p_1 = \\frac{1-p_1}{1-g_1}(s-g_1) = \\frac{p_0}{g_0}(s-g_1)$.\nAt $s=g_0$, $L_1(g_0) = p_1 + \\frac{p_0}{g_0}(g_0-g_1) = p_1 + p_0(1-g_1/g_0) = p_1 + p_0(1-\\exp(-\\beta\\epsilon))$.\nThe condition is $p_1 + p_0(1-\\exp(-\\beta\\epsilon)) \\ge q_0$.\n$0.4 + 0.6(1-1/x) \\ge 0.7 \\implies 1 - 0.6/x \\ge 0.7 \\implies 0.3 \\ge 0.6/x \\implies x \\ge 0.6/0.3=2$.\nSo we need $\\exp(\\beta\\epsilon) \\ge 2$.\n\nBoth conditions must hold. The stronger condition is $\\exp(\\beta\\epsilon) \\ge 2$. The interval for this case is $1.5 \\le x \\le 7/3$. Thus, the transition is possible if $2 \\le \\exp(\\beta\\epsilon) \\le 7/3$.\n\nCombining all cases:\n- $1 < \\exp(\\beta\\epsilon) < 2$: Not possible.\n- $2 \\le \\exp(\\beta\\epsilon) \\le 7/3$: Possible.\n- $\\exp(\\beta\\epsilon) > 7/3$: Possible.\n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for the transition $\\rho_1 \\to \\rho_2$ to be achievable by thermal operations is $\\exp(\\beta\\epsilon) \\ge 2$, which is equivalent to $\\beta\\epsilon \\ge \\ln(2)$.\n\nThe problem asks for a single expression that evaluates to $1$ if this condition holds and $0$ otherwise. This is the definition of the Heaviside step function $\\Theta(z)$, where we define $\\Theta(z)=1$ for $z \\ge 0$ and $\\Theta(z)=0$ for $z < 0$.\nThe expression is therefore $\\Theta(\\beta\\epsilon - \\ln(2))$.",
