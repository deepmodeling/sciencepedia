            "problem": "Consider a two-level quantum probe with Hamiltonian $H = (\\Delta/2)\\sigma_{z}$, where $\\Delta>0$ is the energy gap and $\\sigma_{z}$ is the Pauli-$z$ operator. The probe is weakly coupled to a large thermal reservoir at an unknown temperature $T$, so that, before each measurement, the probe is prepared in the canonical Gibbs state $\\rho(T) = \\exp(-\\beta H)/Z$ with $\\beta = 1/(k_{B} T)$ and $Z = \\mathrm{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta H)]$.

The results are mathematically verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first step is to characterize the quantum system. The Hamiltonian is $H = (\\Delta/2)\\sigma_{z}$. In the standard basis where $\\sigma_z$ is diagonal, the energy eigenstates are the ground state $|g\\rangle$ and the excited state $|e\\rangle$, with corresponding energy eigenvalues $E_g = -\\Delta/2$ and $E_e = +\\Delta/2$. The energy gap is $E_e - E_g = \\Delta$.\n\nThe probe is in a thermal Gibbs state $\\rho(T) = \\exp(-\\beta H)/Z$ at inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. The partition function $Z$ is calculated by summing over the energy eigenvalues:\n$$Z = \\mathrm{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta H)] = \\exp(-\\beta E_e) + \\exp(-\\beta E_g) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\Delta}{2}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\Delta}{2}\\right) = 2 \\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\Delta}{2}\\right)$$\nThe diagonal elements of the density matrix $\\rho(T)$ give the probabilities of finding the probe in the energy eigenstates upon measurement. These probabilities are:\n$$p_e(T) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_e)}{Z} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\Delta/2)}{2 \\cosh(\\beta \\Delta/2)}$$\n$$p_g(T) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_g)}{Z} = \\frac{\\exp(+\\beta \\Delta/2)}{2 \\cosh(\\beta \\Delta/2)}$$\nNote that $p_e(T) + p_g(T) = 1$.\n\nThe problem states that for this system, the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), $F_Q(T)$, is equal to the classical Fisher information (CFI), $F_C(T)$, obtained from the probabilities of the energy measurement outcomes. The CFI for a parameter $T$ derived from a set of probabilities $\\{p_i(T)\\}$ is given by the general formula:\n$$F_C(T) = \\sum_i \\frac{1}{p_i(T)} \\left(\\frac{\\partial p_i(T)}{\\partial T}\\right)^2$$\nFor our two-outcome measurement (outcomes $e$ and $g$), this becomes:\n$$F_Q(T) = F_C(T) = \\frac{1}{p_e(T)}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p_e(T)}{\\partial T}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{p_g(T)}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p_g(T)}{\\partial T}\\right)^2$$\nSince $p_e(T) + p_g(T) = 1$, we have $\\frac{\\partial p_e(T)}{\\partial T} = - \\frac{\\partial p_g(T)}{\\partial T}$. Substituting this into the expression for $F_C(T)$ yields a more compact form:\n$$F_C(T) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial p_e(T)}{\\partial T}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{p_e(T)} + \\frac{1}{p_g(T)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{p_e(T)p_g(T)}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p_e(T)}{\\partial T}\\right)^2$$\nTo compute this, we first find the derivative of $p_e(T)$ with respect to $T$. It is computationally more convenient to use the chain rule with $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial T} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\frac{1}{k_B T^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}$.\n\nLet's first express $p_e$ in a simpler form for differentiation:\n$$p_e(\\beta) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\Delta/2)}{\\exp(-\\beta \\Delta/2) + \\exp(\\beta \\Delta/2)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\beta \\Delta)}$$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $\\beta$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial p_e}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left(1 + \\exp(\\beta\\Delta)\\right)^{-1} = -1 \\cdot \\left(1 + \\exp(\\beta\\Delta)\\right)^{-2} \\cdot \\left(\\Delta \\exp(\\beta\\Delta)\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta \\exp(\\beta\\Delta)}{\\left(1 + \\exp(\\beta\\Delta)\\right)^2}$$\nNext, we determine the term $p_e p_g$:\n$$p_e p_g = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\beta\\Delta)} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\beta\\Delta)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\beta\\Delta)} \\cdot \\frac{\\exp(\\beta\\Delta)}{1 + \\exp(\\beta\\Delta)} = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta\\Delta)}{\\left(1 + \\exp(\\beta\\Delta)\\right)^2}$$\nComparing these two expressions, we see that $\\frac{\\partial p_e}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\Delta \\cdot (p_e p_g)$.\nNow we can compute $\\frac{\\partial p_e}{\\partial T}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial p_e}{\\partial T} = -\\frac{1}{k_B T^2}\\frac{\\partial p_e}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\frac{1}{k_B T^2} (-\\Delta \\cdot p_e p_g) = \\frac{\\Delta}{k_B T^2} p_e p_g$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $F_C(T)$:\n$$F_Q(T) = F_C(T) = \\frac{1}{p_e p_g} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{k_B T^2} p_e p_g\\right)^2 = \\frac{(\\Delta p_e p_g)^2}{(k_B T^2)^2 (p_e p_g)} = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{(k_B T^2)^2} p_e p_g$$\nTo get the final expression, we substitute the form for $p_e p_g$ in terms of hyperbolic functions:\n$$p_e p_g = \\frac{1}{2 \\cosh(\\beta\\Delta/2)} \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta/2) \\exp(\\beta\\Delta/2)}{2 \\cosh(\\beta\\Delta/2)} = \\frac{1}{4 \\cosh^2(\\beta\\Delta/2)} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\Delta}{2}\\right)$$\nThus, the Quantum Fisher Information is:\n$$F_Q(T) = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{(k_B T^2)^2} \\frac{1}{4} \\text{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\Delta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{4 k_B^2 T^4} \\text{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2 k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe Quantum Cramér-Rao Bound states that the variance of any unbiased estimator $\\hat{T}$ is bounded by $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{T}) \\ge \\frac{1}{n F_Q(T)}$. The lower bound, which represents the ultimate precision achievable, is therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{T})_{\\text{QCRB}} = \\frac{1}{n F_Q(T)} = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta^2}{4 k_B^2 T^4} \\text{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2 k_B T}\\right) \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{4 k_B^2 T^4}{n \\Delta^2} \\cosh^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2 k_B T}\\right)$$\n\n### Resource Allocation Discussion\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a qualitative discussion on resource allocation. We have a fixed total interrogation time $\\mathcal{R}$. The thermometry protocol consists of $n$ repetitions, with each repetition requiring a preparation time $t_p$ for the probe to thermalize. Thus, the total time is constrained by $\\mathcal{R} = n t_p$.\n\nThe precision of the temperature estimation is limited by the QCRB, which we denote as $\\delta T^2 \\equiv \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{T})_{\\text{QCRB}}$. From our derivation, $\\delta T^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{n F_Q}$. Using the time constraint $n = \\mathcal{R}/t_p$, we can express the uncertainty bound as:\n$$\\delta T^2 \\propto \\frac{t_p}{\\mathcal{R} F_Q}$$\nTo minimize the uncertainty $\\delta T^2$ for a fixed total time $\\mathcal{R}$, we must minimize the quantity $t_p / F_Q$.\n\nA crucial point is that the Quantum Fisher Information $F_Q$ is not constant but depends on the preparation time $t_p$. The probe thermalizes towards the Gibbs state $\\rho(T)$ with a characteristic rate $\\gamma$. If we start from a fiducial state (e.g., the ground state $|g\\rangle$) that is independent of temperature, its initial Fisher information is zero. As the probe evolves for a time $t_p$, its state $\\rho(t_p)$ becomes increasingly sensitive to the bath temperature $T$, and thus $F_Q(t_p)$ increases from $F_Q(0)=0$ and asymptotically approaches the maximum value $F_{Q,\\text{Gibbs}}$ (which we calculated in the first part) for $t_p \\gg 1/\\gamma$.\n\nWe must therefore analyze the \"cost function\" $C(t_p) = t_p / F_Q(t_p)$ to find the optimal preparation time $t_{p, \\text{opt}}$.\n1.  For very short preparation times ($t_p \\to 0$): $F_Q(t_p)$ also goes to zero. The rate of approach depends on the dynamics, but it is generally faster than linear (e.g., $F_Q(t_p) \\propto t_p^2$ for short times). Thus, the cost function $C(t_p) \\sim t_p / (a t_p^2) = 1/(a t_p)$ diverges. This means using a very large number of very short-duration measurements is highly inefficient.\n2.  For very long preparation times ($t_p \\to \\infty$): The Fisher information saturates at its maximum value, $F_Q(t_p) \\to F_{Q,\\text{Gibbs}}$, which is a constant. In this regime, the cost function becomes $C(t_p) \\approx t_p / F_{Q,\\text{Gibbs}}$, which grows linearly with $t_p$. This means waiting for an excessively long time for each measurement is also inefficient, as the gain in information becomes negligible while the time cost continues to increase.\n\nSince the cost function $C(t_p)$ is large for both very small and very large $t_p$, there must exist an optimal, finite preparation time $t_{p, \\text{opt}}$ that minimizes it. This optimal time represents the most efficient trade-off between acquiring information (letting $F_Q(t_p)$ grow) and the time cost per measurement ($t_p$). This optimal time is necessarily on the order of the thermalization timescale of the system, i.e., $t_{p, \\text{opt}} \\sim 1/\\gamma$.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy for allocating the total time $\\mathcal{R}$ is not to maximize $n$ at the expense of equilibration, nor to ensure perfect equilibration for a few measurements. Instead, the strategy is:\n1.  Identify the optimal single-probe preparation time $t_{p, \\text{opt}}$ which minimizes the ratio $t_p / F_Q(t_p)$. This time will be of order $1/\\gamma$.\n2.  Allocate this optimal time $t_{p, \\text{opt}}$ to each of the $n$ experimental runs.\n3.  The number of runs is then determined by the total resource budget: $n = \\mathcal{R} / t_{p, \\text{opt}}$. This allocation minimizes the final uncertainty on the temperature estimate.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Quantum Fisher Information\n\nThe derivation proceeds by first calculating the partition function, then the density operator, and subsequently the energy variance of the system, which for a thermal state is directly related to the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI).\n\nThe Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ has two distinct energy eigenvalues: $E_0 = 0$ with multiplicity $1$, and $E_1 = \\Delta$ with multiplicity $g$. The Hilbert space is spanned by the orthonormal basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |e_1\\rangle, \\dots, |e_g\\rangle\\}$.\n\n$1$. **Partition Function $Z$**:\nThe partition function $Z$ is the trace of the Boltzmann factor $\\exp(-\\beta \\hat{H})$. In the energy eigenbasis, this is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each state:\n$$Z = \\mathrm{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta \\hat{H})] = \\langle 0| \\exp(-\\beta \\hat{H}) |0\\rangle + \\sum_{m=1}^{g} \\langle e_m| \\exp(-\\beta \\hat{H}) |e_m\\rangle$$\n$$Z = \\exp(-\\beta E_0) + g \\exp(-\\beta E_1) = \\exp(0) + g \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)$$\n$$Z = 1 + g \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)$$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n$2$. **Gibbs State $\\hat{\\rho}_T$**:\nThe density operator for the Gibbs state is:\n$$\\hat{\\rho}_T = \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp(-\\beta \\hat{H})$$\nIn the energy eigenbasis, this is a diagonal operator:\n$$\\hat{\\rho}_T = \\frac{1}{Z} \\left( \\exp(-\\beta E_0) |0\\rangle\\langle 0| + \\exp(-\\beta E_1) \\sum_{m=1}^{g} |e_m\\rangle\\langle e_m| \\right)$$\n$$\\hat{\\rho}_T = \\frac{1}{1 + g \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)} \\left( |0\\rangle\\langle 0| + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta) \\sum_{m=1}^{g} |e_m\\rangle\\langle e_m| \\right)$$\nThe probability of finding the system in the ground state is $P_0 = \\frac{1}{Z}$. The total probability of finding it in the excited manifold is $P_1 = \\frac{g \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)}{Z}$. Note that $P_0 + P_1 = 1$.\n\n$3$. **QFI and Energy Variance**:\nFor a thermal state $\\hat{\\rho}_\\beta = \\exp(-\\beta \\hat{H})/Z$, the derivative with respect to $\\beta$ is $\\partial_\\beta \\hat{\\rho}_\\beta = (\\langle \\hat{H} \\rangle - \\hat{H})\\hat{\\rho}_\\beta$. Since $\\hat{H}$ and $\\hat{\\rho}_\\beta$ are diagonal in the same basis, they commute. The equation for the SLD with respect to $\\beta$, $\\partial_\\beta \\hat{\\rho}_\\beta = (\\hat{\\rho}_\\beta \\hat{L}_\\beta + \\hat{L}_\\beta \\hat{\\rho}_\\beta)/2$, simplifies to $\\partial_\\beta \\hat{\\rho}_\\beta = \\hat{\\rho}_\\beta \\hat{L}_\\beta$. This gives $\\hat{L}_\\beta = \\langle \\hat{H} \\rangle - \\hat{H}$.\nThe QFI with respect to $\\beta$ is then:\n$F_Q(\\beta) = \\mathrm{Tr}[\\hat{\\rho}_\\beta \\hat{L}_\\beta^2] = \\mathrm{Tr}[\\hat{\\rho}_\\beta (\\langle \\hat{H} \\rangle - \\hat{H})^2] = \\langle (\\hat{H} - \\langle \\hat{H} \\rangle)^2 \\rangle = (\\Delta H)^2$.\nThus, the QFI for $\\beta$ is simply the variance of the Hamiltonian. We can calculate this from $\\langle \\hat{H} \\rangle$ and $\\langle \\hat{H}^2 \\rangle$.\n\n$4$. **Calculation of Energy Variance $(\\Delta H)^2$**:\nFirst, we find the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, $\\langle \\hat{H} \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle \\hat{H} \\rangle = \\mathrm{Tr}[\\hat{\\rho}_T \\hat{H}] = P_0 E_0 + P_1 E_1 = \\frac{1}{Z}(0) + \\frac{g \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)}{Z}(\\Delta) = \\frac{g \\Delta \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)}{1 + g \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)}$$\nNext, we find the expectation value of $\\hat{H}^2$. Since $\\hat{H} = \\Delta \\hat{P}_e$ where $\\hat{P}_e = \\sum_{m=1}^{g} |e_m\\rangle\\langle e_m|$ is a projection operator, we have $\\hat{P}_e^2 = \\hat{P}_e$.

A higher QFI, $F_Q(T)$, corresponds to a better potential sensitivity. As shown, $F_Q(T)$ is directly proportional to the energy variance $(\\Delta H)^2$. The multiplicity $g$ modifies this variance and, consequently, the thermometer's performance.\n\nThe energy variance $(\\Delta H)^2 = \\Delta^2 P_0 P_1$ depends on the total populations of the ground ($P_0 = 1/Z$) and excited ($P_1 = g\\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)/Z$) manifolds. The factor $g$ acts as an entropic weight, increasing the probability of occupying the excited manifold compared to a non-degenerate system at the same temperature.\n\nThis has two main consequences:\n$1$. **Shift of Optimal Temperature**: The variance $(\\Delta H)^2$, and thus the QFI, is maximized when the ground and excited manifolds are equally populated ($P_0 = P_1 = 1/2$). This occurs when $g \\exp(-\\Delta/k_B T) = 1$, which yields an optimal operating temperature of $T_{\\text{opt}} = \\frac{\\Delta}{k_B \\ln(g)}$. For a simple two-level system ($g=1$), this happens only in the limit $T \\to \\infty$. For $g>1$, the probe's maximum sensitivity is achieved at a finite temperature, which can be tuned by engineering the degeneracy $g$. A larger $g$ lowers the optimal temperature.\n\n$2$. **Enhancement of Low-Temperature Sensitivity**: At low temperatures ($k_B T \\ll \\Delta$), the excited state population is very small. The variance is approximately $(\\Delta H)^2 \\approx g \\Delta^2 \\exp(-\\Delta/k_B T)$. This shows that at a fixed low temperature, the variance and the QFI scale linearly with $g$. By increasing the degeneracy, one can significantly boost the signal and the temperature sensitivity in the low-temperature regime, where a non-degenerate probe would be highly insensitive.\n\nIn summary, degeneracy provides a crucial resource for quantum thermometry, allowing for tunable, high-precision temperature estimation at finite temperatures, especially in the low-temperature domain.",

This exercise demonstrates the profound connection between the Quantum Fisher Information for temperature and the system's heat capacity, $C_L(T)$, revealing that $F_Q(T) = C_L(T)/(k_B T^2)$ . By applying the principles of finite-size scaling near a continuous phase transition, you will analyze how the diverging fluctuations at a critical point can be harnessed for ultra-precise thermometry.

            "problem": "Consider a quantum many-body lattice system in $d$ spatial dimensions with a local, translation-invariant Hamiltonian $H$ defined on a hypercubic lattice of linear size $L$ and total number of sites $N=L^d$. The system is in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$ with Boltzmann constant $k_B$, described by the Gibbs state $\\rho_T = e^{-\\beta H}/Z(\\beta)$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ and $Z(\\beta) = \\mathrm{Tr}[e^{-\\beta H}]$ is the partition function. The task is to analyze quantum thermometry near a continuous phase transition at critical temperature $T_c$ using the quantum Fisher information for temperature $F_Q(T)$, expressed in terms of energy cumulants and their finite-size scaling with $L$.\n\nUse the following foundational bases only:\n- The definition of the Gibbs state $\\rho_T = e^{-\\beta H}/Z(\\beta)$ with $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n- The definition of the quantum Fisher information $F_Q(\\theta)$ for a family of states $\\rho_\\theta$, and the connection between the quantum Fisher information and the symmetric logarithmic derivative for a parameter $\\theta$.\n- The definition of energy cumulants $\\kappa_n$ of $H$ with respect to the Gibbs distribution, which are the connected moments of the energy and can be obtained from derivatives of $\\ln Z(\\beta)$.\n- Widely used finite-size scaling assumptions near criticality: the singular part of the heat capacity scales with system size as a power of $L$ multiplied by a universal scaling function of a dimensionless variable determined by the correlation length exponent.\n\nStarting from these bases alone, derive an expression for $F_Q(T)$ in terms of energy cumulants $\\kappa_n$ of the Hamiltonian $H$, and deduce how $F_Q(T)$ scales with the system size $L$ near the critical temperature $T_c$ under standard finite-size scaling hypotheses. Your derivation must clearly identify the role of the second energy cumulant and explain how the heat capacity emerges and scales near criticality. Then, implement a numerical evaluation based on the following modeling assumptions that render the analysis computationally testable:\n1. Work in dimensionless lattice units with $k_B = 1$.\n2. Decompose the finite-size heat capacity $C_L(T)$ into a singular part and a regular (extensive) part. The singular part obeys the finite-size scaling ansatz near $T_c$,\n   - For $\\alpha > 0$: $C_L^{\\mathrm{sing}}(T) \\propto L^{\\alpha/\\nu} f_C(x)$,\n   - For $\\alpha = 0$: $C_L^{\\mathrm{sing}}(T) \\propto \\ln L \\, f_C(x)$,\n   - For $\\alpha  0$: $C_L^{\\mathrm{sing}}(T) \\propto L^{\\alpha/\\nu} f_C(x)$,\n   where $x = (T - T_c) L^{1/\\nu}$ and $f_C$ is a universal, dimensionless scaling function.\n3. The regular part scales extensively as $C_L^{\\mathrm{reg}}(T) \\propto L^{d}$.\n4. For concreteness, use the specific, smooth, dimensionless scaling function $f_C(x) = 1/(1 + x^2)$ and write the full heat capacity as\n   $$C_L(T) = A \\, S(L;\\alpha,\\nu) \\, f_C(x) + B \\, L^d,$$\n   where $S(L;\\alpha,\\nu)$ is the appropriate size-dependent singular factor specified above, $A$ and $B$ are positive amplitudes, $d$ is the spatial dimension, and $x = (T - T_c) L^{1/\\nu}$.\n\nHaving derived $F_Q(T)$ from first principles, implement a program that, for each test case, evaluates $F_Q(T)$ at the given parameters using the above scaling ansatz.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature, $F_Q(T)$, for a quantum many-body system in a thermal Gibbs state. Subsequently, we are to analyze its finite-size scaling behavior near a critical point and implement a numerical calculation based on a provided scaling model. The Boltzmann constant is set to unity, $k_B=1$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles. The parameter of interest for estimation is the temperature $T$. The Gibbs state of the system is given by $\\rho_T = e^{-\\beta H}/Z(\\beta)$, where $H$ is the system Hamiltonian, $\\beta = 1/T$ (with $k_B=1$), and $Z(\\beta) = \\mathrm{Tr}[e^{-\\beta H}]$ is the partition function. It is more convenient to first compute the QFI with respect to the inverse temperature $\\beta$, denoted $F_Q(\\beta)$, and then transform to $T$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian $H$ has an eigenbasis $\\{|E_n\\rangle\\}$ with corresponding eigenvalues $\\{E_n\\}$. In this basis, the Gibbs state $\\rho_\\beta$ is diagonal:\n$$ \\rho_\\beta = \\sum_n p_n(\\beta) |E_n\\rangle\\langle E_n| \\quad \\text{where} \\quad p_n(\\beta) = \\frac{e^{-\\beta E_n}}{Z(\\beta)} $$\nFor a family of states that are diagonal in a fixed basis, the QFI for a parameter $\\theta$ simplifies to the classical Fisher information of the probability distribution of the eigenvalues, $p_n(\\theta)$:\n$$ F_Q(\\theta) = \\sum_n \\frac{1}{p_n(\\theta)} \\left( \\frac{\\partial p_n(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} \\right)^2 $$\nIn our case, the parameter is $\\beta$. We first compute the partial derivative of $p_n(\\beta)$ with respect to $\\beta$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p_n(\\beta)}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left( \\frac{e^{-\\beta E_n}}{Z(\\beta)} \\right) = \\frac{-E_n e^{-\\beta E_n} Z(\\beta) - e^{-\\beta E_n} \\frac{\\partial Z(\\beta)}{\\partial \\beta}}{Z(\\beta)^2} $$\nThe derivative of the partition function is related to the expectation value of the energy, $\\langle H \\rangle = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho_\\beta H)$:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle = \\sum_n E_n p_n(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{Z(\\beta)} \\sum_n E_n e^{-\\beta E_n} = -\\frac{1}{Z(\\beta)} \\frac{\\partial Z(\\beta)}{\\partial \\beta} $$\nThus, $\\frac{\\partial Z(\\beta)}{\\partial \\beta} = -Z(\\beta) \\langle H \\rangle$. Substituting this back into the expression for $\\partial p_n(\\beta)/\\partial \\beta$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p_n(\\beta)}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{-E_n e^{-\\beta E_n}}{Z(\\beta)} - \\frac{e^{-\\beta E_n}}{Z(\\beta)^2} (-Z(\\beta)\\langle H \\rangle) = p_n(\\beta) (\\langle H \\rangle - E_n) $$\nNow, we substitute this result into the formula for $F_Q(\\beta)$:\n$$ F_Q(\\beta) = \\sum_n \\frac{1}{p_n(\\beta)} \\left( p_n(\\beta)(\\langle H \\rangle - E_n) \\right)^2 = \\sum_n p_n(\\beta) (E_n - \\langle H \\rangle)^2 $$\nThis final expression is the definition of the variance of the energy, $\\langle (\\Delta H)^2 \\rangle = \\langle H^2 \\rangle - \\langle H \\rangle^2$. This variance is also the second cumulant of the energy, $\\kappa_2$. The energy cumulants $\\kappa_n$ are generated by the free energy, $\\ln Z(\\beta)$, as $\\kappa_n = (-1)^n \\partial^n_\\beta \\ln Z(\\beta)$. Specifically for $n=2$:\n$$ \\kappa_2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\beta^2} \\ln Z(\\beta) = -\\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial \\beta} = \\langle H^2 \\rangle - \\langle H \\rangle^2 $$\nTherefore, we have established the direct connection $F_Q(\\beta) = \\kappa_2 = \\langle (\\Delta H)^2 \\rangle$.\n\nTo obtain the QFI for temperature $T$, $F_Q(T)$, we apply the chain rule for Fisher information:\n$$ F_Q(T) = F_Q(\\beta) \\left( \\frac{d\\beta}{dT} \\right)^2 $$\nWith $\\beta = 1/T$, the derivative is $d\\beta/dT = -1/T^2$. This yields:\n$$ F_Q(T) = \\kappa_2 \\left( -\\frac{1}{T^2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\kappa_2}{T^4} $$\nThe final step is to relate this to a more familiar thermodynamic quantity, the heat capacity $C$. The heat capacity (at constant volume, appropriate for a lattice system) is defined as the rate of change of the mean energy with temperature:\n$$ C = \\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial \\beta} \\frac{d\\beta}{dT} = (-\\kappa_2) \\left(-\\frac{1}{T^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\kappa_2}{T^2} $$\nFrom this, we express the second cumulant as $\\kappa_2 = C T^2$. Substituting this into our expression for $F_Q(T)$:\n$$ F_Q(T) = \\frac{C T^2}{T^4} = \\frac{C}{T^2} $$\nThis is the central result connecting the quantum Fisher information for temperature to the heat capacity. It demonstrates that the ultimate precision of thermometry is determined by the system's heat capacity.\n\nThe scaling of $F_Q(T)$ with system size $L$ near a critical temperature $T_c$ is therefore dictated by the scaling of the heat capacity $C_L(T)$. The problem provides a finite-size scaling ansatz for $C_L(T)$:\n$$ C_L(T) = C_L^{\\mathrm{sing}}(T) + C_L^{\\mathrm{reg}}(T) $$\nThe regular part, $C_L^{\\mathrm{reg}}(T)$, scales extensively with the system volume, $C_L^{\\mathrm{reg}}(T) = B L^d$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension and $B$ is a non-universal amplitude. The singular part, $C_L^{\\mathrm{sing}}(T)$, captures the critical behavior and is described by a scaling function $f_C(x)$ of the scaling variable $x = (T-T_c)L^{1/\\nu}$, where $\\nu$ is the correlation length critical exponent. The dependence on system size $L$ is governed by the specific heat critical exponent $\\alpha$. The full expression is:\n$$ C_L(T) = A \\, S(L;\\alpha,\\nu) \\, f_C(x) + B \\, L^d, $$\nwhere $S(L;\\alpha,\\nu)$ is the singular scaling factor:\n$$ S(L;\\alpha,\\nu) = \\begin{cases} L^{\\alpha/\\nu}  \\text{if } \\alpha \\neq 0 \\\\ \\ln L  \\text{if } \\alpha = 0 \\end{cases} $$\nThe scaling function is given as $f_C(x) = 1/(1+x^2)$.\nThe QFI for temperature, $F_Q(T)$, scales in direct proportion to $C_L(T)$:\n$$ F_Q(T) = \\frac{1}{T^2} \\left( A \\, S(L;\\alpha,\\nu) \\, \\frac{1}{1+x^2} + B \\, L^d \\right) $$\nAt criticality ($T=T_c$), $x=0$ and $f_C(0)=1$, so the scaling is determined by the dominant term between $A S(L;\\alpha,\\nu)$ and $B L^d$. If the singular part dominates (e.g., if $\\alpha/\\nu > d$), the QFI can exhibit super-extensive scaling, enabling high-precision thermometry near the critical point.\n\nFor the numerical implementation, we discretely calculate $F_Q(T)$ for each test case using the final formula. The parameters $d, \\alpha, \\nu, A, B, L, T, T_c$ are provided for each case. The algorithm consists of:\n$1$. For each test case, identify the values of the parameters.\n$2$. Determine the singular factor $S(L;\\alpha,\\nu)$ based on whether $\\alpha$ is zero.\n$3$. Compute the scaling variable $x = (T - T_c)L^{1/\\nu}$.\n$4$. Evaluate the heat capacity $C_L(T)$ using the provided model.\n$5$. Compute the QFI as $F_Q(T) = C_L(T)/T^2$.\nThis procedure is directly implemented in the provided Python code.",
