A full derivation of the solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe derivation proceeds by first calculating the partition function, then the internal energy, and finally the heat capacity, from which the requested low-temperature asymptotic form is extracted.\n\n**1. Partition Function, $Z(\\beta)$**\nThe canonical partition function is defined as the sum over all states of the Boltzmann factor, $Z(\\beta) = \\sum_{n} \\exp(-\\beta E_{n})$. For the given two-level system with energy eigenvalues $E_{0}=0$ and $E_{1}=\\Delta$, the partition function is:\n$$Z(\\beta) = \\exp(-\\beta E_{0}) + \\exp(-\\beta E_{1}) = \\exp(-\\beta \\cdot 0) + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)$$\n$$Z(\\beta) = 1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)$$\n\n**2. Internal Energy, $U(\\beta)$**\nThe internal energy $U$ is given by the derivative of the logarithm of the partition function with respect to $\\beta$:\n$$U(\\beta) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln Z(\\beta) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln\\left(1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)\\right)$$\nApplying the chain rule for differentiation, we get:\n$$U(\\beta) = -\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}\\left(1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)\\right)$$\n$$U(\\beta) = -\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)} \\cdot \\left(-\\Delta \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)\\right)$$\n$$U(\\beta) = \\frac{\\Delta \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)}$$\nThis expression can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(\\beta\\Delta)$:\n$$U(\\beta) = \\frac{\\Delta \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta) \\exp(\\beta \\Delta)}{(1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)) \\exp(\\beta \\Delta)} = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\exp(\\beta \\Delta) + 1}$$\n\n**3. Heat Capacity, $C(T)$**\nThe heat capacity at constant volume is defined as $C(T) = \\partial U/\\partial T$. It is more convenient to compute this derivative using the chain rule with respect to $\\beta$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$$C(T) = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\beta} \\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial T}$$\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $\\beta$ with respect to $T$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(\\frac{1}{k_{B} T}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{k_{B} T^{2}}$$\nNext, we compute the derivative of $U$ with respect to $\\beta$ using the second form of $U(\\beta)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\exp(\\beta \\Delta) + 1}\\right) = \\Delta \\cdot (-1) \\cdot \\left(\\exp(\\beta \\Delta) + 1\\right)^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}\\left(\\exp(\\beta \\Delta)\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\Delta \\left(\\exp(\\beta \\Delta) + 1\\right)^{-2} \\left(\\Delta \\exp(\\beta \\Delta)\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta^{2} \\exp(\\beta \\Delta)}{(\\exp(\\beta \\Delta) + 1)^{2}}$$\nNow, we combine the terms to find $C(T)$:\n$$C(T) = \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta^{2} \\exp(\\beta \\Delta)}{(\\exp(\\beta \\Delta) + 1)^{2}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{k_{B} T^{2}}\\right)$$\n$$C(T) = \\frac{1}{k_{B} T^{2}} \\frac{\\Delta^{2} \\exp(\\beta \\Delta)}{(\\exp(\\beta \\Delta) + 1)^{2}}$$\nSubstituting $1/(k_B T^2) = k_B (1/(k_B T))^2 = k_B \\beta^2$, the exact expression for the heat capacity is:\n$$C(T) = k_{B} (\\beta \\Delta)^{2} \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\Delta)}{(\\exp(\\beta \\Delta) + 1)^{2}}$$\n\n**4. Low-Temperature Asymptotic Form**\nThe problem asks for the leading low-temperature asymptotic form, which corresponds to the limit $T \\to 0$. This is equivalent to $\\beta = 1/(k_B T) \\to \\infty$ or $\\beta \\Delta \\gg 1$.\nIn this limit, the exponential term $\\exp(\\beta\\Delta)$ becomes very large. We can therefore approximate the denominator:\n$$(\\exp(\\beta \\Delta) + 1)^{2} \\approx (\\exp(\\beta \\Delta))^{2} = \\exp(2\\beta \\Delta)$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for $C(T)$:\n$$C(T) \\approx k_{B} (\\beta \\Delta)^{2} \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\Delta)}{\\exp(2\\beta \\Delta)} = k_{B} (\\beta \\Delta)^{2} \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)$$\nThis is the leading-order asymptotic expression for the heat capacity at low temperatures.\n\n**5. Dimensionless Heat Capacity, $c(T)$**\nThe problem requests the dimensionless heat capacity, defined as $c(T) \\equiv C(T)/k_{B}$. Dividing our asymptotic result by $k_{B}$:\n$$c(T) \\approx (\\beta \\Delta)^{2} \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta)$$\nFinally, we express the result in terms of the given variables $\\Delta$, $k_{B}$, and $T$ by substituting $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$$c(T) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{k_{B} T}\\right)^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nThis expression represents the exponential suppression of the heat capacity as the temperature drops far below the energy scale of the excited state, a characteristic feature of systems with an energy gap.",

However, for the given equations to be dimensionally consistent (specifically, $\\gamma = 2\\pi J(\\omega_0)$, where $\\gamma$ is a rate), $\\eta$ must be dimensionless. This is a minor inconsistency in the problem description, but it does not affect the physical reasoning or the dimensional correctness of the final result.

The minor terminological issue regarding the dimensionality of $\\eta$ does not invalidate the problem's core physical and mathematical structure. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe state of the quantum harmonic oscillator during the cooling process can be characterized by the time-dependent mean occupation number of its energy levels, denoted by $\\langle n(t) \\rangle = \\mathrm{Tr}[\\rho(t) a^\\dagger a]$, where $\\rho(t)$ is the density matrix of the oscillator. The energy of the oscillator is directly proportional to this quantity: $E(t) = \\hbar \\omega_0 (\\langle n(t) \\rangle + 1/2)$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the initial and final states are thermal (Gibbs) states at temperatures $T_i$ and $T_f$, respectively. For a harmonic oscillator in a thermal state at temperature $T$, the mean occupation number is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution:\n$$ \\langle n \\rangle_T = \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{k_B T}) - 1} $$\nThus, the cooling process involves changing the mean occupation number from an initial value $\\langle n_i \\rangle = (\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{k_B T_i}) - 1)^{-1}$ to a final value $\\langle n_f \\rangle = (\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{k_B T_f}) - 1)^{-1}$.\n\nThe dynamics of the oscillator are described by a Lindblad master equation, as the system is weakly coupled to a Markovian reservoir. For coupling to a zero-temperature reservoir via the annihilation operator $a$, the master equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[H, \\rho] + \\mathcal{D}(\\rho) = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[H, \\rho] + \\gamma \\left( a \\rho a^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2}\\{a^\\dagger a, \\rho\\} \\right) $$\nHere, $\\{ \\cdot, \\cdot \\}$ denotes the anti-commutator. The decay rate $\\gamma$ is given by Fermi's Golden Rule, which connects it to the reservoir's spectral density $J(\\omega)$ evaluated at the oscillator's transition frequency $\\omega_0$. The rotating-wave approximation ensures that only this frequency is relevant.\n$$ \\gamma = 2\\pi J(\\omega_0) $$\nUsing the provided spectral density $J(\\omega) = \\eta \\omega \\exp(-\\omega/\\Omega_c)$, the decay rate is:\n$$ \\gamma = 2\\pi \\eta \\omega_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\omega_0}{\\Omega_c}\\right) $$\nThis rate is limited by the exponential cutoff $\\Omega_c$.\n\nTo find the time evolution of the mean occupation number $\\langle n(t) \\rangle$, we compute its time derivative:\n$$ \\frac{d\\langle n(t) \\rangle}{dt} = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left(a^\\dagger a \\frac{d\\rho}{dt}\\right) $$\nThe unitary part of the evolution, $-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathrm{Tr}(a^\\dagger a [H, \\rho])$, vanishes because $[a^\\dagger a, H] = 0$. The dissipative part gives:\n$$ \\frac{d\\langle n(t) \\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma \\, \\mathrm{Tr}\\left(a^\\dagger a \\left( a \\rho a^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2}a^\\dagger a \\rho - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho a^\\dagger a \\right) \\right) = \\gamma \\, \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( \\rho (a^\\dagger a^\\dagger a a - \\frac{1}{2} a^\\dagger a a^\\dagger a - \\frac{1}{2} a^\\dagger a a^\\dagger a) \\right) $$\nUsing the commutation relation $[a, a^\\dagger] = 1$, we have $a^\\dagger a a^\\dagger a = a^\\dagger (a^\\dagger a + 1)a = (a^\\dagger)^2 a^2 + a^\\dagger a$. Substituting this in, we get:\n$$ \\frac{d\\langle n(t) \\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma \\, \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( \\rho (a^\\dagger a^\\dagger a a - (a^\\dagger a^\\dagger a a + a^\\dagger a)) \\right) = -\\gamma \\, \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho a^\\dagger a) = -\\gamma \\langle n(t) \\rangle $$\nThe equation of motion for the mean occupation number is a simple exponential decay:\n$$ \\frac{d\\langle n \\rangle}{dt} = -\\gamma \\langle n \\rangle $$\n\nThe problem asks for a minimal time based on a speed-limit inequality. For a given state with mean occupation $\\langle n \\rangle$, the instantaneous speed of cooling can be defined as $v(t) = |d\\langle n \\rangle / dt|$. The Lindblad dynamics provides the maximum possible rate for the specified system-bath coupling. Any realistic cooling protocol based on this interaction mechanism cannot be faster. Thus, the upper bound on the speed (the \"speed limit\") is:\n$$ \\left| \\frac{d\\langle n \\rangle}{dt} \\right| \\leq \\gamma \\langle n \\rangle_t $$\nThe minimal cooling time $\\tau_{\\min}$ is achieved when this inequality is saturated at all times during the process. We can find this time by integrating:\n$$ dt = \\frac{d\\langle n \\rangle}{d\\langle n \\rangle/dt} \\implies \\tau_{\\min} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau_{\\min}} dt = \\int_{\\langle n_i \\rangle}^{\\langle n_f \\rangle} \\frac{d\\langle n \\rangle}{-\\gamma \\langle n \\rangle} = \\int_{\\langle n_f \\rangle}^{\\langle n_i \\rangle} \\frac{d\\langle n \\rangle}{\\gamma \\langle n \\rangle} $$\nThe integration yields:\n$$ \\tau_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} [\\ln \\langle n \\rangle]_{\\langle n_f \\rangle}^{\\langle n_i \\rangle} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} (\\ln \\langle n_i \\rangle - \\ln \\langle n_f \\rangle) = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\langle n_i \\rangle}{\\langle n_f \\rangle}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\gamma$, $\\langle n_i \\rangle$, and $\\langle n_f \\rangle$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\eta \\omega_0 \\exp(-\\omega_0/\\Omega_c)} \\ln\\left( \\frac{(\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{k_B T_i}) - 1)^{-1}}{(\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{k_B T_f}) - 1)^{-1}} \\right) $$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final result for the minimal cooling time:\n$$ \\tau_{\\min} = \\frac{\\exp(\\omega_0/\\Omega_c)}{2\\pi \\eta \\omega_0} \\ln\\left( \\frac{\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{k_B T_f}) - 1}{\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{k_B T_i}) - 1} \\right) $$\nThis result connects to the third law of thermodynamics. As the target temperature approaches absolute zero, $T_f \\to 0$, the argument of the logarithm behaves as:\n$$ \\frac{\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{k_B T_f}) - 1}{\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{k_B T_i}) - 1} \\approx \\frac{\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{k_B T_f})}{\\text{const.}} $$\nThe logarithm of this term is dominated by $\\ln(\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{k_B T_f})) = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{k_B T_f}$.\nTherefore, for low final temperatures, the minimal cooling time scales as:\n$$ \\tau_{\\min} \\propto \\frac{1}{T_f} \\quad \\text{as } T_f \\to 0 $$\nThis divergence demonstrates that an infinite amount of time is required to reach absolute zero, which is a dynamical statement of the unattainability principle of the third law.",

In the context of the underlying theory of majorization, the relevant curve is typically the *lower* convex envelope of the specified vertices (the curve must be convex).

Therefore, we proceed by interpreting the thermo-majorization curve as the piecewise-linear function connecting the ordered vertices.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution proceeds by first computing the necessary Boltzmann weights, then constructing the thermo-majorization curves for the initial state $p$ and the target state $q$, and finally computing the minimum of their difference.\n\n**1. Calculate Boltzmann Weights**\nThe Boltzmann weights are $w_i = \\exp(-\\beta E_i)$. Given $E_0=0$, $E_1=\\Delta$, $E_2=2\\Delta$, and $\\beta\\Delta = \\ln 20$.\n$w_0 = \\exp(-\\beta E_0) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\n$w_1 = \\exp(-\\beta E_1) = \\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) = \\exp(-\\ln 20) = \\frac{1}{20}$.\n$w_2 = \\exp(-\\beta E_2) = \\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta) = (\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta))^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{20}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{400}$.\n\n**2. Construct the Thermo-majorization Curve for the Initial State, $y_p(x)$**\nThe populations are $p_0 = \\frac{1}{2}$, $p_1 = \\frac{1}{3}$, $p_2 = \\frac{1}{6}$. We must order the levels by the decreasing ratio $\\gamma_i = \\frac{p_i}{w_i}$.\n$\\gamma_0 = \\frac{p_0}{w_0} = \\frac{1/2}{1} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{p_1}{w_1} = \\frac{1/3}{1/20} = \\frac{20}{3}$.\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{p_2}{w_2} = \\frac{1/6}{1/400} = \\frac{400}{6} = \\frac{200}{3}$.\nSince $\\frac{200}{3}  \\frac{20}{3}  \\frac{1}{2}$, the ordering of the indices is $(2, 1, 0)$.\n\nWe now find the vertices of the piecewise-linear curve by taking cumulative sums, starting with $(0,0)$.\n- Point 0: $(x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)$.\n- Point 1 (from state 2): $(x_1, y_1) = (w_2, p_2) = (\\frac{1}{400}, \\frac{1}{6})$.\n- Point 2 (from state 1): $(x_2, y_2) = (w_2+w_1, p_2+p_1) = (\\frac{1}{400}+\\frac{1}{20}, \\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{3}) = (\\frac{1+20}{400}, \\frac{1+2}{6}) = (\\frac{21}{400}, \\frac{3}{6}) = (\\frac{21}{400}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n- Point 3 (from state 0): $(x_3, y_3) = (w_2+w_1+w_0, p_2+p_1+p_0) = (\\frac{21}{400}+1, \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}) = (\\frac{421}{400}, 1)$.\n\nThe curve $y_p(x)$ is the piecewise-linear function connecting these vertices:\n- For $x \\in [0, \\frac{1}{400}]$, $y_p(x)$ connects $(0,0)$ and $(\\frac{1}{400}, \\frac{1}{6})$.\n- For $x \\in [\\frac{1}{400}, \\frac{21}{400}]$, $y_p(x)$ connects $(\\frac{1}{400}, \\frac{1}{6})$ and $(\\frac{21}{400}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n- For $x \\in [\\frac{21}{400}, \\frac{421}{400}]$, $y_p(x)$ connects $(\\frac{21}{400}, \\frac{1}{2})$ and $(\\frac{421}{400}, 1)$.\n\n**3. Construct the Thermo-majorization Curve for the Target State, $y_q(x)$**\nThe populations are $q_0 = 1$, $q_1 = 0$, $q_2 = 0$. We order by $\\gamma_i = \\frac{q_i}{w_i}$.\n$\\gamma_0 = \\frac{q_0}{w_0} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{q_1}{w_1} = \\frac{0}{1/20} = 0$.\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{q_2}{w_2} = \\frac{0}{1/400} = 0$.\nSince $1  0$, the ordering of indices is $(0, 1, 2)$ (the order of $1$ and $2$ is irrelevant as their populations are zero).\n\nWe find the vertices for $y_q(x)$:\n- Point 0: $(x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)$.\n- Point 1 (from state 0): $(x_1, y_1) = (w_0, q_0) = (1, 1)$.\n- Point 2 (from state 1): $(x_2, y_2) = (w_0+w_1, q_0+q_1) = (1+\\frac{1}{20}, 1+0) = (\\frac{21}{20}, 1)$.\n- Point 3 (from state 2): $(x_3, y_3) = (w_0+w_1+w_2, q_0+q_1+q_2) = (\\frac{21}{20}+\\frac{1}{400}, 1+0) = (\\frac{420+1}{400}, 1) = (\\frac{421}{400}, 1)$.\n\nThe curve $y_q(x)$ is the piecewise-linear function defined by:\n- For $x \\in [0, 1]$, $y_q(x) = x$.\n- For $x \\in [1, \\frac{421}{400}]$, $y_q(x) = 1$.\n\n**4. Compute the Unattainability Witness $\\Delta_{\\min}$**\nWe need to find the minimum of $D(x) = y_p(x) - y_q(x)$ on the interval $[0, \\frac{421}{400}]$. Since $D(x)$ is a piecewise-linear function, its minimum must occur at one of the vertices (knots) of either curve. The set of unique x-coordinates of the vertices is $\\{0, \\frac{1}{400}, \\frac{21}{400}, 1, \\frac{21}{20}, \\frac{421}{400}\\}$. We evaluate $D(x)$ at these points.\n\n- At $x=0$: $D(0) = y_p(0) - y_q(0) = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n- At $x=\\frac{421}{400}$: $D(\\frac{421}{400}) = y_p(\\frac{421}{400}) - y_q(\\frac{421}{400}) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n- At $x=\\frac{1}{400}$: $y_p(\\frac{1}{400}) = \\frac{1}{6}$. $y_q(\\frac{1}{400}) = \\frac{1}{400}$ (since $\\frac{1}{400}  1$). $D(\\frac{1}{400}) = \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{400} = \\frac{200-3}{1200} = \\frac{197}{1200}  0$.\n- At $x=\\frac{21}{400}$: $y_p(\\frac{21}{400}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. $y_q(\\frac{21}{400}) = \\frac{21}{400}$. $D(\\frac{21}{400}) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{21}{400} = \\frac{200-21}{400} = \\frac{179}{400}  0$.\n- At $x=1$:\n  - $y_q(1) = 1$.\n  - To find $y_p(1)$, we use the equation for the third segment of $y_p(x)$, which connects $(\\frac{21}{400}, \\frac{1}{2})$ and $(\\frac{421}{400}, 1)$. The slope is $m = \\frac{1 - 1/2}{421/400 - 21/400} = \\frac{1/2}{400/400} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n  - The equation is $y_p(x) - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(x - \\frac{21}{400})$.\n  - $y_p(1) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\frac{21}{400}) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{379}{400}) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{379}{800} = \\frac{400}{800} + \\frac{379}{800} = \\frac{779}{800}$.\n  - $D(1) = y_p(1) - y_q(1) = \\frac{779}{800} - 1 = \\frac{779 - 800}{800} = -\\frac{21}{800}$.\n\nAn analysis of the slopes of $D(x)$ shows that $D(x)$ increases on $[0, \\frac{21}{400}]$, decreases on $[\\frac{21}{400}, 1]$, and increases on $[1, \\frac{421}{400}]$. This confirms that a local minimum occurs at $x=1$. Since $D(0)=0$ and $D(1)=-\\frac{21}{800}  0$, this local minimum is the global minimum. The calculations at other knots are for completeness but are not strictly necessary given this slope analysis. For instance, at $x=21/20=420/400$, $D(x)=-1/800$, which is greater than $-21/800$.\n\nThe minimum value of the difference is $-\\frac{21}{800}$.",
