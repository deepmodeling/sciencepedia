Before we can understand what makes a good thermoelectric material, we must first understand the conditions under which thermoelectric effects are absent.

Let $f_0(E) = f(E, \\mu, T)$.\n\nThe expansion of $f(E, \\mu', T')$ around $(\\mu, T)$ is:\n$$\nf(E, \\mu', T') \\approx f_0(E) + \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\mu}(\\mu'-\\mu) + \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial T}(T'-T)\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of the Fermi function $f(E,\\mu,T) = \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{E-\\mu}{k_B T}\\right)+1\\right]^{-1}$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mu} = -\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial T} = -\\frac{E-\\mu}{T}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\n$$\nHere, all derivatives are evaluated at the equilibrium state $(\\mu, T)$, so we use $\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}$.\n\nApplying this to the difference $f_L - f_R$:\n$$\nf_L - f_R \\approx \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\mu}(\\mu_L-\\mu_R) + \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial T}(T_L-T_R)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the derivatives and the differences $\\mu_L-\\mu_R = e\\,\\delta V$ and $T_L-T_R = \\delta T$:\n$$\nf_L - f_R \\approx \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)(e\\,\\delta V) + \\left(-\\frac{E-\\mu}{T}\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)(\\delta T)\n$$\n$$\nf_L - f_R \\approx \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)\\left[ e\\,\\delta V + \\frac{E-\\mu}{T}\\delta T \\right]\n$$\nNow we substitute this linearized difference into the Landauer formula for the current:\n$$\nI \\approx \\frac{2e}{h}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E\\,T(E)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)\\left[e\\,\\delta V + \\frac{E-\\mu}{T}\\delta T\\right]\n$$\nSeparating the terms proportional to $\\delta V$ and $\\delta T$:\n$$\nI = \\left[\\frac{2e^2}{h}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E\\,T(E)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)\\right]\\delta V + \\left[\\frac{2e}{hT}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E\\,T(E)(E-\\mu)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)\\right]\\delta T\n$$\nThe Seebeck coefficient $S$ is defined by the open-circuit condition $I=0$:\n$$\n0 = \\left[\\frac{2e^2}{h}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E\\,T(E)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)\\right]\\delta V + \\left[\\frac{2e}{hT}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E\\,T(E)(E-\\mu)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)\\right]\\delta T\n$$\nSolving for the ratio $\\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta T}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta T}\\bigg|_{I=0} = -\\frac{\\frac{2e}{hT}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E\\,T(E)(E-\\mu)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)}{\\frac{2e^2}{h}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E\\,T(E)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)}\n$$\nUsing the definition $S = -\\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta T}|_{I=0}$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\frac{1}{eT}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E\\,T(E)(E-\\mu)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E\\,T(E)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the Seebeck coefficient in the linear response regime, known as the Mott formula.\n\nNext, we specialize to the case where the transmission probability $T(E)$ is a constant, $T(E)=T_0$, over the energy range where $(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E})$ is non-negligible. Since $(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E})$ is sharply peaked around $E=\\mu$ with a width of a few $k_B T$, the assumption is that $T(E)$ is constant in this window. We can thus pull $T_0$ out of the integrals:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\frac{1}{eT} \\cdot T_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E\\,(E-\\mu)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)}{T_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E\\,\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{eT}\\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E\\,(E-\\mu)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E\\,\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)}\n$$\nLet's evaluate the two integrals. The integral in the denominator is:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)\\mathrm{d}E = -[f_0(E)]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = -[\\lim_{E\\to\\infty}f_0(E) - \\lim_{E\\to-\\infty}f_0(E)] = -[0-1] = 1\n$$\nThe integral in the numerator is:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (E-\\mu)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)\\mathrm{d}E\n$$\nThe function $(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E})$ is symmetric about $E=\\mu$. To see this, let $x = (E-\\mu)/(k_B T)$. Then $(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}) = \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\frac{\\exp(x)}{(\\exp(x)+1)^2}$. This function is even in $x$, since $\\frac{\\exp(-x)}{(\\exp(-x)+1)^2} = \\frac{\\exp(x)}{(\\exp(x)+1)^2}$. Therefore, $(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E})$ is an even function of the variable $(E-\\mu)$.\nThe term $(E-\\mu)$ is an odd function of $(E-\\mu)$.\nThe integrand, $(E-\\mu)(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E})$, is the product of an odd function and an even function, which results in an odd function with respect to the point $E=\\mu$. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ is identically zero.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (E-\\mu)\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial E}\\right)\\mathrm{d}E = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $S$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{1}{eT} \\frac{0}{1} = 0\n$$\nThe Seebeck coefficient is thus $0 \\, \\text{V/K}$.\n\nThe physical origin of this result lies in the particle-hole symmetry of the system. A temperature difference $\\delta T$ creates a thermal driving force. In the hotter reservoir, there are more thermally excited electrons at energies $E > \\mu$ (particles) and more empty states at energies $E  \\mu$ (holes) compared to the colder reservoir.\nA net current of electrons from hot to cold at energies $E = \\mu+\\Delta E$ contributes a charge current. A net current of holes from hot to cold at energies $E = \\mu-\\Delta E$ is equivalent to a flow of electrons from cold to hot, also contributing a charge current. Since electrons and holes have opposite charge signs ($q_e = -e$, $q_h = +e$), their contributions to the thermocurrent can cancel.\nFor a constant transmission probability $T(E) = T_0$, the transport characteristics are identical for electrons above $\\mu$ and holes below $\\mu$. This perfect particle-hole symmetry in the transmission means that for any contribution to the thermally driven current from electrons at $E=\\mu+\\Delta E$, there is an exactly cancelling contribution from holes at $E=\\mu-\\Delta E$. The net charge current induced by the temperature difference is zero. Consequently, no voltage bias $\\delta V$ is required to enforce the zero-current (open-circuit) condition. Therefore, the Seebeck coefficient $S = -(\\delta V/\\delta T)|_{I=0}$ is zero. A non-zero Seebeck coefficient requires an asymmetry in the transmission probability $T(E)$ with respect to the chemical potential $\\mu$.",

This happens because for a very narrow window, all transmitted electrons have nearly the same energy, making heat and charge currents almost perfectly proportional. The open-circuit condition strongly suppresses this coupled transport, leading to a much faster decrease in thermal conductance compared to electrical conductance. This decoupling is highly beneficial for thermoelectric performance, as shown by $ZT \\propto w^{-2}$, which diverges as $w \\to 0$.",

Thermopower (Seebeck Coefficient)**\n\nThe Seebeck coefficient is found from the open-circuit condition, $I=0$. For both current expressions, this requires the numerator to be zero (assuming non-zero couplings), which means $f_L(E_{res}) = f_R(E_{res})$, where $E_{res}$ is the relevant resonance energy. This equality of Fermi-Dirac distributions implies equality of their arguments:\n$$ \\frac{E_{res} - \\mu_L}{k_B T_L} = \\frac{E_{res} - \\mu_R}{k_B T_R} $$\nSubstituting $\\mu_{L/R} = \\mu \\pm eV/2$ and $T_{L/R} = T \\pm \\Delta T/2$:\n$$ \\frac{E_{res} - (\\mu + eV/2)}{k_B (T + \\Delta T/2)} = \\frac{E_{res} - (\\mu - eV/2)}{k_B (T - \\Delta T/2)} $$\nCross-multiplying and keeping only terms linear in the small quantities $V$ and $\\Delta T$:\n$$ (E_{res} - \\mu - eV/2)(T - \\Delta T/2) \\approx (E_{res} - \\mu + eV/2)(T + \\Delta T/2) $$\n$$ (E_{res}-\\mu)T - \\frac{(E_{res}-\\mu)\\Delta T}{2} - \\frac{eVT}{2} \\approx (E_{res}-\\mu)T + \\frac{(E_{res}-\\mu)\\Delta T}{2} + \\frac{eVT}{2} $$\n$$ - (E_{res}-\\mu)\\Delta T \\approx eVT $$\nThe Seebeck coefficient $S = -V/\\Delta T$ is therefore:\n$$ S = \\frac{E_{res} - \\mu}{eT} $$\nThis general result applies to both resonances:\n-   Near the $0 \\leftrightarrow 1$ degeneracy: $S_{0 \\leftrightarrow 1} = \\frac{\\epsilon_d - \\mu}{eT}$\n-   Near the $1 \\leftrightarrow 2$ degeneracy: $S_{1 \\leftrightarrow 2} = \\frac{\\epsilon_d + U - \\mu}{eT}$",
