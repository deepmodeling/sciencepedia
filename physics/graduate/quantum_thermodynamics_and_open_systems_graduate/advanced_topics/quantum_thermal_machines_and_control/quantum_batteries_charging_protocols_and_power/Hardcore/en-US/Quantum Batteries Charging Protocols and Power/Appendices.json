            "solution": "The problem asks for the determination of the passive state, an explicit unitary for maximum work extraction, and the ergotropy for a given three-level quantum system. We begin by stating the fundamental principles.\n\nThe ergotropy, denoted by $\\mathcal{W}$, is the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from a quantum state $\\rho$ with respect to a Hamiltonian $H$ through unitary operations acting solely on the system. It is defined as the difference between the initial average energy of the system and the minimum possible average energy achievable via any unitary transformation $U$.\n\nThe initial average energy is $E_{\\text{initial}} = \\text{Tr}(\\rho H)$.\nAfter a unitary evolution, the state becomes $\\rho' = U \\rho U^\\dagger$, and its energy is $E_{\\text{final}}(U) = \\text{Tr}(\\rho' H) = \\text{Tr}(U \\rho U^\\dagger H)$.\nThe minimum achievable energy is $E_{\\text{min}} = \\min_{U} \\text{Tr}(U \\rho U^\\dagger H)$. The state that achieves this minimum energy is called the passive state, denoted by $\\pi$.\nThus, the ergotropy is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{W} = E_{\\text{initial}} - E_{\\text{min}} = \\text{Tr}(\\rho H) - \\text{Tr}(\\pi H)\n$$\nA state is passive with respect to a Hamiltonian $H$ if it is diagonal in the energy eigenbasis of $H$ and its populations (eigenvalues) are non-increasing with respect to the corresponding energy eigenvalues.\n\nThe givens of the problem are:\nThe Hamiltonian is $H = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\epsilon_i | i \\rangle \\langle i |$, where $|i\\rangle$ are the energy eigenstates.\nThe energy eigenvalues are $\\epsilon_1 = 0\\,\\text{J}$, $\\epsilon_2 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\text{J}$, and $\\epsilon_3 = 3.5 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\text{J}$, satisfying $\\epsilon_1 < \\epsilon_2 < \\epsilon_3$.\nThe initial state is $\\rho = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} p_i | i \\rangle \\langle i |$.\nThe populations are $p_1 = 0.2$, $p_2 = 0.5$, and $p_3 = 0.3$. Note that $\\sum_i p_i = 0.2+0.5+0.3 = 1.0$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial energy $E_{\\text{initial}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{initial}} = \\text{Tr}(\\rho H) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} p_i \\epsilon_i = p_1 \\epsilon_1 + p_2 \\epsilon_2 + p_3 \\epsilon_3\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nE_{\\text{initial}} = (0.2)(0) + (0.5)(2.0 \\times 10^{-21}) + (0.3)(3.5 \\times 10^{-21})\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{initial}} = 0 + 1.0 \\times 10^{-21} + 1.05 \\times 10^{-21} = 2.05 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\text{J}\n$$\n\nNext, we identify the passive state $\\pi$. Since a unitary transformation preserves the eigenvalues of a density matrix, the passive state $\\pi$ must have the same eigenvalues as the initial state $\\rho$. The eigenvalues of $\\rho$ are its populations $\\{p_1, p_2, p_3\\}$. To form the passive state, we must arrange these populations in descending order and assign them to the energy levels in ascending order.\n\nThe populations are $\\{0.2, 0.5, 0.3\\}$.\nSorted in descending order, the populations are $p^{\\downarrow}_1 = 0.5$, $p^{\\downarrow}_2 = 0.3$, $p^{\\downarrow}_3 = 0.2$.\nThe passive state $\\pi$ is constructed by assigning these sorted populations to the energy eigenstates $|1\\rangle, |2\\rangle, |3\\rangle$ respectively.\n\n**1. The passive state associated with $\\rho$ and $H$ is:**\n$$\n\\pi = p^{\\downarrow}_1 | 1 \\rangle \\langle 1 | + p^{\\downarrow}_2 | 2 \\rangle \\langle 2 | + p^{\\downarrow}_3 | 3 \\rangle \\langle 3 |\n$$\n$$\n\\pi = 0.5 | 1 \\rangle \\langle 1 | + 0.3 | 2 \\rangle \\langle 2 | + 0.2 | 3 \\rangle \\langle 3 |\n$$\nThis state is passive because its populations $\\{0.5, 0.3, 0.2\\}$ are non-increasing with the energy levels $\\{\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_3\\}$.\n\nNow, we calculate the energy of the passive state, which is the minimum possible energy $E_{\\text{min}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{min}} = \\text{Tr}(\\pi H) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} p^{\\downarrow}_i \\epsilon_i = p^{\\downarrow}_1 \\epsilon_1 + p^{\\downarrow}_2 \\epsilon_2 + p^{\\downarrow}_3 \\epsilon_3\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nE_{\\text{min}} = (0.5)(0) + (0.3)(2.0 \\times 10^{-21}) + (0.2)(3.5 \\times 10^{-21})\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{min}} = 0 + 0.6 \\times 10^{-21} + 0.7 \\times 10^{-21} = 1.3 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\text{J}\n$$\n\n**2. An explicit unitary operator $U$ that achieves the maximum work extraction.**\nThe optimal unitary $U$ transforms the initial state $\\rho$ into the passive state $\\pi$: $\\pi = U \\rho U^\\dagger$. This transformation amounts to a permutation of the populations among the energy eigenstates.\nThe initial state has population $p_1=0.2$ on state $|1\\rangle$, $p_2=0.5$ on $|2\\rangle$, and $p_3=0.3$ on $|3\\rangle$.\nThe passive state has population $p^{\\downarrow}_1=p_2=0.5$ on $|1\\rangle$, $p^{\\downarrow}_2=p_3=0.3$ on $|2\\rangle$, and $p^{\\downarrow}_3=p_1=0.2$ on $|3\\rangle$.\nThis requires a permutation that sends:\n- The state carrying population $p_1$ (i.e., $|1\\rangle$) to the state with the highest energy $\\epsilon_3$ (i.e., $|3\\rangle$).\n- The state carrying population $p_2$ (i.e., $|2\\rangle$) to the state with the lowest energy $\\epsilon_1$ (i.e., $|1\\rangle$).\n- The state carrying population $p_3$ (i.e., $|3\\rangle$) to the state with the intermediate energy $\\epsilon_2$ (i.e., $|2\\rangle$).\n\nThe action of the unitary operator $U$ on the basis states must therefore be (up to phases, which we can set to zero):\n$U|1\\rangle = |3\\rangle$\n$U|2\\rangle = |1\\rangle$\n$U|3\\rangle = |2\\rangle$\nThis corresponds to the permutation operator:\n$$\nU = | 1 \\rangle \\langle 2 | + | 2 \\rangle \\langle 3 | + | 3 \\rangle \\langle 1 |\n$$\nIn the basis $\\{|1\\rangle, |2\\rangle, |3\\rangle\\}$, this operator has the matrix representation:\n$$\nU = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**3.

For a passive state, no work can be extracted by unitary operations. The state cannot be brought to a lower average energy.\nTherefore, the ergotropy of the dephased state is zero:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathcal{D}[\\rho]} = 0\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Comparison of Optimal Unitaries\n\nFor the coherent state $\\rho$, its eigenvectors are not aligned with the energy eigenstates $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle, |2\\rangle\\}$. Specifically, the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_0$ is a superposition of $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$. To minimize the final energy, the optimal unitary $U_{opt}$ must map the eigenvectors of $\\rho$ to the energy eigenstates such that the populations are reordered correctly. $U_{opt}$ must map the eigenvector of $\\rho$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_0$ to $|0\\rangle$, the eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ (which is $|0\\rangle$) to $|1\\rangle$, and the eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\lambda_2$ to $|2\\rangle$. This transformation is non-trivial and mixes the energy levels.\n\nFor the dephased state $\\mathcal{D}[\\rho]$, the state is already diagonal in the energy eigenbasis, and its populations $\\{p_0, p_1, p_2\\}$ are already sorted in decreasing order. The state is passive. The optimal \"unitary\" to extract work is the identity operator $U=I$, and the extracted work is zero. Any unitary that commutes with $\\rho_d$ (i.e., any unitary diagonal in the energy basis) would also result in zero work extraction.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe difference in ergotropy is $\\Delta W = \\mathcal{E}_\\rho - \\mathcal{E}_{\\mathcal{D}[\\rho]}$.\n$$\n\\Delta W = \\hbar\\omega(\\sqrt{0.1} - 0.15) - 0 = \\hbar\\omega(\\sqrt{0.1} - 0.15)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless ratio $\\Delta W/(\\hbar\\omega)$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta W}{\\hbar\\omega} = \\sqrt{0.1} - 0.15 \\approx 0.316227766 - 0.15 = 0.166227766\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $0.1662$.",

The number of such states is $\\binom{4}{2}=6$. We label these states by the set $S \\subset \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ of the positions of the two up spins. For example, $S=\\{1,2\\}$ corresponds to the state $|\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\downarrow\\rangle$.\n\nThe basis states $|S\\rangle$ are eigenstates of $H_{\\mathrm{B}}$ because $H_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is diagonal in the computational basis. The energy eigenvalue $E(S)$ for a state $|S\\rangle$ is:\n$$\nE(S) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_{i \\in S} \\omega_i - \\sum_{j \\notin S} \\omega_j \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_{i \\in S} \\omega_i - \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{4}\\omega_k - \\sum_{i \\in S} \\omega_i\\right) \\right) = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\omega_i - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^{4}\\omega_k\n$$\nThis matches the formula provided in the problem statement.\nLet's calculate the energies for the $6$ states in the zero-magnetization sector. The sum of energy scales is $\\sum_{j=1}^{4}\\omega_{j} = 1+2+3+5=11$. The constant offset is $-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sum \\omega_j = -5.5$.\nThe energies $E_S$ for each state $|S\\rangle$ are:\n- $E_{12} = (\\omega_1 + \\omega_2) - 5.5 = 1+2-5.5 = -2.5$\n- $E_{13} = (\\omega_1 + \\omega_3) - 5.5 = 1+3-5.5 = -1.5$\n- $E_{14} = (\\omega_1 + \\omega_4) - 5.5 = 1+5-5.5 = 0.5$\n- $E_{23} = (\\omega_2 + \\omega_3) - 5.5 = 2+3-5.5 = -0.5$\n- $E_{24} = (\\omega_2 + \\omega_4) - 5.5 = 2+5-5.5 = 1.5$\n- $E_{34} = (\\omega_3 + \\omega_4) - 5.5 = 3+5-5.5 = 2.5$\n\nThe initial state $\\rho_{0}$ is diagonal in this energy eigenbasis: $\\rho_{0} = \\sum_{S} p_{S} |S\\rangle\\langle S|$, where $p_S$ are the given initial populations (probabilities).\n- $p_{12} = 0.30$\n- $p_{13} = 0.25$\n- $p_{14} = 0.20$\n- $p_{23} = 0.12$\n- $p_{24} = 0.08$\n- $p_{34} = 0.05$\nThe sum of probabilities is $0.30+0.25+0.20+0.12+0.08+0.05=1.00$.\n\nThe initial energy of the battery is $E_{\\mathrm{init}} = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho_{0}H_{\\mathrm{B}}) = \\sum_{S} p_S E_S$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{init}} = (0.30)(-2.5) + (0.25)(-1.5) + (0.20)(0.5) + (0.12)(-0.5) + (0.08)(1.5) + (0.05)(2.5)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{init}} = -0.75 - 0.375 + 0.10 - 0.06 + 0.12 + 0.125 = -0.84\n$$\nThe final state is $\\rho_f=U\\rho_0 U^{\\dagger}$. Its energy is $E_{\\mathrm{final}} = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho_f H_{\\mathrm{B}})$. Since $H_B$ is diagonal in the $|S\\rangle$ basis, we can write $E_{\\mathrm{final}} = \\sum_S p'_S E_S$, where $p'_S = \\langle S | \\rho_f | S \\rangle$ are the final populations of the energy eigenstates.\nThe final populations $p'_S$ are related to the initial populations $p_S$ via the unitary transformation $U$:\n$$\np'_{S} = \\langle S | U \\rho_0 U^{\\dagger} | S \\rangle = \\langle S | U \\left( \\sum_{S'} p_{S'} |S'\\rangle\\langle S'| \\right) U^{\\dagger} | S \\rangle = \\sum_{S'} p_{S'} |\\langle S|U|S'\\rangle|^2\n$$\nLet the vectors of populations be $p = (p_{S_1}, p_{S_2}, \\dots)^T$ and $p' = (p'_{S_1}, p'_{S_2}, \\dots)^T$. The relation is $p' = D p$, where $D$ is a matrix with elements $D_{S,S'} = |\\langle S|U|S'\\rangle|^2$. This matrix $D$ is doubly stochastic, meaning its elements are non-negative and all its rows and columns sum to $1$.\nBy the Hardy-Littlewood-Pólya theorem, the existence of such a transformation implies that the vector of initial populations $p$ majorizes the vector of final populations $p'$.\nWe want to maximize $E_{\\mathrm{final}} = \\sum_S p'_S E_S$ over all possible final population vectors $p'$ that can be reached from $p$. This is a linear function over the convex set of all vectors majorized by $p$. The maximum value of such a function is achieved at an extreme point of this set. The extreme points are the vectors obtained by permuting the elements of the initial population vector $p$.\nTherefore, to maximize $E_{\\mathrm{final}}$, we must arrange the populations such that the largest probability is assigned to the state with the highest energy, the second-largest probability to the state with the second-highest energy, and so on. This is an application of the rearrangement inequality.\n\nLet us sort the energies in ascending order:\n$E^{\\uparrow} = (-2.5, -1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5)$ corresponding to states $\\{12\\}, \\{13\\}, \\{23\\}, \\{14\\}, \\{24\\}, \\{34\\}$.\nLet us sort the initial probabilities in ascending order:\n$p^{\\uparrow} = (0.05, 0.08, 0.12, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30)$ which come from the initial states $\\{34\\}, \\{24\\}, \\{23\\}, \\{14\\}, \\{13\\}, \\{12\\}$.\n\nTo maximize the final energy $E_{\\mathrm{final,max}} = \\sum_i p'_i E_i$, we must pair the sorted lists in the same order (either both ascending or both descending). Let's use descending order for both.\nSorted energies (descending): $E^{\\downarrow}$\n- $E_{34} = 2.5$\n- $E_{24} = 1.5$\n- $E_{14} = 0.5$\n- $E_{23} = -0.5$\n- $E_{13} = -1.5$\n- $E_{12} = -2.5$\n\nSorted probabilities (descending): $p^{\\downarrow}$\n- $p_{12} = 0.30$\n- $p_{13} = 0.25$\n- $p_{14} = 0.20$\n- $p_{23} = 0.12$\n- $p_{24} = 0.08$\n- $p_{34} = 0.05$\n\nThe maximal final energy is obtained by pairing the largest probability with the largest energy, the second-largest with the second-largest, and so on:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{final,max}} = (0.30)(2.5) + (0.25)(1.5) + (0.20)(0.5) + (0.12)(-0.5) + (0.08)(-1.5) + (0.05)(-2.5)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{final,max}} = 0.75 + 0.375 + 0.10 - 0.06 - 0.12 - 0.125 = 1.225 - 0.305 = 0.92\n$$\nThe maximum achievable charge is the difference between this maximal final energy and the initial energy:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\max} = E_{\\mathrm{final,max}} - E_{\\mathrm{init}} = 0.92 - (-0.84) = 1.76\n$$\nThe structure of an optimal unitary $U_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is one that implements the required permutation of populations. This means the doubly stochastic matrix $D_{S,S'} = |\\langle S|U_{\\mathrm{opt}}|S'\\rangle|^2$ must be a permutation matrix that maps the initial population distribution to the optimal final one. The optimal final populations $p'_S$ are:\n- $p'_{34} = 0.30$ (from initial state $|12\\rangle$)\n- $p'_{24} = 0.25$ (from initial state $|13\\rangle$)\n- $p'_{14} = 0.20$ (from initial state $|14\\rangle$)\n- $p'_{23} = 0.12$ (from initial state $|23\\rangle$)\n- $p'_{13} = 0.08$ (from initial state $|24\\rangle$)\n- $p'_{12} = 0.05$ (from initial state $|34\\rangle$)\n\nA unitary that achieves this is a permutation operator on the basis states. For example, a unitary $U$ that swaps the basis states with corresponding initial and final populations:\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{opt}} = |34\\rangle\\langle 12| + |12\\rangle\\langle 34| + |24\\rangle\\langle 13| + |13\\rangle\\langle 24| + |14\\rangle\\langle 14| + |23\\rangle\\langle 23|\n$$\nThis operator swaps the state $|12\\rangle$ with $|34\\rangle$ and the state $|13\\rangle$ with $|24\\rangle$, while leaving $|14\\rangle$ and $|23\\rangle$ unchanged. More generally, any unitary $U$ acting on the zero-magnetization subspace for which the matrix of squared-magnitudes of its elements, $[|\\langle S_i | U | S_j \\rangle|^2]$, equals the permutation matrix that maps the sorted initial probability vector to the sorted final one, is an optimal unitary. This allows for arbitrary phases in the mapping. Since this unitary acts entirely within the zero-magnetization sector, it automatically satisfies the constraint $[U, S^z_{\\mathrm{tot}}] = 0$.",
