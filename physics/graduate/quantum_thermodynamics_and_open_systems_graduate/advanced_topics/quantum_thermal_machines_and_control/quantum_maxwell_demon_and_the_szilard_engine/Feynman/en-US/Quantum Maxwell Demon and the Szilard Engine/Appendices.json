            "problem": "Consider a single, nonrelativistic quantum particle of mass $m$ in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length $L$, weakly coupled to a large thermal reservoir at fixed temperature $T$ so that the particle is always described by a canonical (Gibbs) state at the current confinement length. An idealized Maxwell's demon inserts a massless, perfectly reflecting partition at the midpoint, $L/2$, and performs a projective position measurement to determine on which side ($x \\in [0,L/2]$ or $x \\in [L/2,L]$) the particle resides. Conditioned on the outcome, the demon then allows a quasi-static isothermal expansion by moving the partition to the end wall, extracting work from the thermal reservoir during this step.\n\nAssume the high-temperature, nondegenerate regime in which the single-particle canonical partition function for a one-dimensional box of length $\\ell$ takes the form $Z(\\ell)=\\ell/\\lambda_T$, where $\\lambda_T=h/\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}$ is the thermal de Broglie length, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Using only fundamental thermodynamics of isothermal, quasi-static processes in contact with a thermal reservoir and the canonical definition of the Helmholtz free energy, derive the maximum average work extracted during the isothermal expansion step described above, starting from the state immediately after the measurement (when the particle is confined to length $L/2$) and ending when the partition reaches the boundary (length $L$). Express your final answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $k_B$ and $T$, in Joules. Do not substitute numerical values.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum average work extracted during a quasi-static isothermal expansion of a single-particle system. The process starts immediately after a projective measurement localizes the particle to one half of a box of original length $L$, and ends when the confining partition reaches the end of the box.\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic principle for a quasi-static, isothermal process at a constant temperature $T$ is that the maximum work, $W_{\\text{max}}$, that can be extracted from the system is equal to the negative of the change in its Helmholtz free energy, $\\Delta F$.\n$$W_{\\text{max}} = -\\Delta F = -(F_f - F_i) = F_i - F_f$$\nwhere $F_i$ is the initial Helmholtz free energy and $F_f$ is the final Helmholtz free energy.\n\nThe Helmholtz free energy $F$ is defined in the canonical ensemble by the relation:\n$$F = -k_B T \\ln Z$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Z$ is the canonical partition function of the system.\n\nThe problem provides the canonical partition function for a single particle of mass $m$ in a one-dimensional box of length $\\ell$ in the high-temperature, nondegenerate regime:\n$$Z(\\ell) = \\frac{\\ell}{\\lambda_T}$$\nwhere $\\lambda_T = h/\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}$ is the thermal de Broglie wavelength.\n\nWe must identify the initial and final states of the isothermal expansion process to calculate the corresponding free energies.\n\nThe initial state of the expansion process is defined as the state *immediately after* the demon's measurement. The measurement determines that the particle is confined to one of two halves of the original box. Irrespective of which half the particle is found in (i.e., the interval $[0, L/2]$ or $[L/2, L]$), the length of the confining potential well at the start of the expansion is $\\ell_i = L/2$. The particle is in thermal equilibrium with the reservoir within this new confinement length.\n\nThus, the initial partition function, $Z_i$, is:\n$$Z_i = Z(\\ell_i) = Z\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = \\frac{L/2}{\\lambda_T}$$\nThe initial Helmholtz free energy, $F_i$, is therefore:\n$$F_i = -k_B T \\ln(Z_i) = -k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{2\\lambda_T}\\right)$$\n\nThe final state of the expansion process is reached when the demon has quasi-statically moved the partition to the end of the box. This means the particle is now free to occupy the entire length $L$ of the original container. The final confinement length is $\\ell_f = L$.\n\nThe final partition function, $Z_f$, is:\n$$Z_f = Z(\\ell_f) = Z(L) = \\frac{L}{\\lambda_T}$$\nThe final Helmholtz free energy, $F_f$, is:\n$$F_f = -k_B T \\ln(Z_f) = -k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_T}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in Helmholtz free energy, $\\Delta F$:\n$$\\Delta F = F_f - F_i$$\n$$\\Delta F = \\left[-k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_T}\\right)\\right] - \\left[-k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{2\\lambda_T}\\right)\\right]$$\n$$\\Delta F = k_B T \\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{2\\lambda_T}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_T}\\right)\\right]$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we get:\n$$\\Delta F = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{L/(2\\lambda_T)}{L/\\lambda_T}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta F = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\nUsing the identity $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\Delta F = -k_B T \\ln(2)$$\n\nThe maximum work extracted, $W_{\\text{max}}$, is the negative of this change:\n$$W_{\\text{max}} = -\\Delta F = -(-k_B T \\ln(2))$$\n$$W_{\\text{max}} = k_B T \\ln(2)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the *average* work extracted. Before the measurement, there is a probability of $1/2$ for the particle to be in the left half and a probability of $1/2$ for it to be in the right half. If it is found in the left half, the expansion process is an expansion from $L/2$ to $L$, and the work extracted is $k_B T \\ln(2)$. If it is found in the right half, the partition is at $L/2$ and moves to $0$, which is equivalent to an expansion of the container from a length of $L/2$ to $L$. The work extracted is also $k_B T \\ln(2)$. Since the work extracted is identical for both outcomes of the measurement, the average work extracted during the expansion phase is simply this value.\n\nLet $W_{\\text{left}}$ be the work extracted if the particle is found on the left, and $W_{\\text{right}}$ be the work for the right.\n$$W_{\\text{left}} = k_B T \\ln(2)$$\n$$W_{\\text{right}} = k_B T \\ln(2)$$\nThe average work $\\langle W \\rangle$ is given by:\n$$\\langle W \\rangle = P(\\text{left}) W_{\\text{left}} + P(\\text{right}) W_{\\text{right}}$$\n$$\\langle W \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} (k_B T \\ln(2)) + \\frac{1}{2} (k_B T \\ln(2)) = k_B T \\ln(2)$$\nTherefore, the maximum average work extracted during the isothermal expansion step is $k_B T \\ln(2)$.",

The heat dissipated into the environment is $Q_{diss} = -Q$. Therefore, $Q_{diss} = W - \\Delta U$.\n\nThe process is specified as quasistatic and isothermal. For such a reversible process, the heat absorbed by the system is related to the change in its entropy, $\\Delta S$, by $Q_{rev} = T \\Delta S$. The work done on the system is equal to the change in its Helmholtz free energy, $W_{rev} = \\Delta F$. The minimal heat dissipation corresponds to this reversible limit. Any irreversibility would lead to greater dissipation. Thus, the minimal heat dissipated is $Q_{diss, min} = -Q_{rev} = -T \\Delta S$.\n\nOur task is to calculate the change in entropy of the system, $\\Delta S = S_{final} - S_{initial}$. The entropy $S$ is related to the internal energy $U$ and the Helmholtz free energy $F$ by $F = U - TS$, or $S = (U-F)/T$. The free energy is given by $F = -k_B T \\ln Z$, where $Z$ is the partition function and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFirst, we construct the total partition function $Z(\\lambda)$ for the system.

The system is prepared in the canonical Gibbs state at inverse temperature $\\beta$, so that the probability of occupying $|e\\rangle$ is $q_{e}=\\exp(-\\beta\\varepsilon)/Z$ and the probability of occupying $|g\\rangle$ is $q_{g}=1/Z$, where $Z=1+\\exp(-\\beta\\varepsilon)$ is the partition function.\n\nA Maxwell’s demon performs a quantum non-demolition (QND) energy measurement with binary outcome $m\\in\\{g,e\\}$, intended to identify whether the system is in $|g\\rangle$ or $|e\\rangle$. The readout has symmetric classical error probability $p\\in[0,1]$, meaning the outcome equals the actual energy eigenstate with probability $1-p$ and is flipped with probability $p$. The QND property ensures the post-measurement state is the same energy eigenstate as pre-measurement.\n\nBased on the outcome $m$, the demon applies the following feedback protocol:\n- If $m=e$, the demon instantaneously quenches the Hamiltonian to $H'$, which has the same spectrum $\\{0,\\varepsilon\\}$ but swaps the energy assignment so that $E_{e}'=0$ and $E_{g}'=\\varepsilon$.

Our calculation explicitly computes the left-hand side and derives an expression for $\\gamma$, thereby fulfilling the verification requested. The structure of the result is consistent with established results in quantum thermodynamics for feedback-controlled systems, exhibiting correct limiting behaviors for $p=0$ (perfect measurement), $p=1/2$ (no information), and $p=1$ (perfectly incorrect measurement).",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2(1 - p + p\\exp(-\\beta\\varepsilon))}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta\\varepsilon)}}$$"
