            "problem": "Consider a single, nonrelativistic quantum particle of mass $m$ in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length $L$, weakly coupled to a large thermal reservoir at fixed temperature $T$ so that the particle is always described by a canonical (Gibbs) state at the current confinement length. An idealized Maxwell's demon inserts a massless, perfectly reflecting partition at the midpoint, $L/2$, and performs a projective position measurement to determine on which side ($x \\in [0,L/2]$ or $x \\in [L/2,L]$) the particle resides. Conditioned on the outcome, the demon then allows a quasi-static isothermal expansion by moving the partition to the end wall, extracting work from the thermal reservoir during this step.\n\nAssume the high-temperature, nondegenerate regime in which the single-particle canonical partition function for a one-dimensional box of length $\\ell$ takes the form $Z(\\ell)=\\ell/\\lambda_T$, where $\\lambda_T=h/\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}$ is the thermal de Broglie length, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Using only fundamental thermodynamics of isothermal, quasi-static processes in contact with a thermal reservoir and the canonical definition of the Helmholtz free energy, derive the maximum average work extracted during the isothermal expansion step described above, starting from the state immediately after the measurement (when the particle is confined to length $L/2$) and ending when the partition reaches the boundary (length $L$). Express your final answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $k_B$ and $T$, in Joules. Do not substitute numerical values.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum average work extracted during a quasi-static isothermal expansion of a single-particle system. The process starts immediately after a projective measurement localizes the particle to one half of a box of original length $L$, and ends when the confining partition reaches the end of the box.\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic principle for a quasi-static, isothermal process at a constant temperature $T$ is that the maximum work, $W_{\\text{max}}$, that can be extracted from the system is equal to the negative of the change in its Helmholtz free energy, $\\Delta F$.\n$$W_{\\text{max}} = -\\Delta F = -(F_f - F_i) = F_i - F_f$$\nwhere $F_i$ is the initial Helmholtz free energy and $F_f$ is the final Helmholtz free energy.\n\nThe Helmholtz free energy $F$ is defined in the canonical ensemble by the relation:\n$$F = -k_B T \\ln Z$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Z$ is the canonical partition function of the system.\n\nThe problem provides the canonical partition function for a single particle of mass $m$ in a one-dimensional box of length $\\ell$ in the high-temperature, nondegenerate regime:\n$$Z(\\ell) = \\frac{\\ell}{\\lambda_T}$$\nwhere $\\lambda_T = h/\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}$ is the thermal de Broglie wavelength.\n\nWe must identify the initial and final states of the isothermal expansion process to calculate the corresponding free energies.\n\nThe initial state of the expansion process is defined as the state *immediately after* the demon's measurement. The measurement determines that the particle is confined to one of two halves of the original box. Irrespective of which half the particle is found in (i.e., the interval $[0, L/2]$ or $[L/2, L]$), the length of the confining potential well at the start of the expansion is $\\ell_i = L/2$. The particle is in thermal equilibrium with the reservoir within this new confinement length.\n\nThus, the initial partition function, $Z_i$, is:\n$$Z_i = Z(\\ell_i) = Z\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = \\frac{L/2}{\\lambda_T}$$\nThe initial Helmholtz free energy, $F_i$, is therefore:\n$$F_i = -k_B T \\ln(Z_i) = -k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{2\\lambda_T}\\right)$$\n\nThe final state of the expansion process is reached when the demon has quasi-statically moved the partition to the end of the box. This means the particle is now free to occupy the entire length $L$ of the original container. The final confinement length is $\\ell_f = L$.\n\nThe final partition function, $Z_f$, is:\n$$Z_f = Z(\\ell_f) = Z(L) = \\frac{L}{\\lambda_T}$$\nThe final Helmholtz free energy, $F_f$, is:\n$$F_f = -k_B T \\ln(Z_f) = -k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_T}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in Helmholtz free energy, $\\Delta F$:\n$$\\Delta F = F_f - F_i$$\n$$\\Delta F = \\left[-k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_T}\\right)\\right] - \\left[-k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{2\\lambda_T}\\right)\\right]$$\n$$\\Delta F = k_B T \\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{2\\lambda_T}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_T}\\right)\\right]$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we get:\n$$\\Delta F = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{L/(2\\lambda_T)}{L/\\lambda_T}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta F = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\nUsing the identity $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\Delta F = -k_B T \\ln(2)$$\n\nThe maximum work extracted, $W_{\\text{max}}$, is the negative of this change:\n$$W_{\\text{max}} = -\\Delta F = -(-k_B T \\ln(2))$$\n$$W_{\\text{max}} = k_B T \\ln(2)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the *average* work extracted. Before the measurement, there is a probability of $1/2$ for the particle to be in the left half and a probability of $1/2$ for it to be in the right half. If it is found in the left half, the expansion process is an expansion from $L/2$ to $L$, and the work extracted is $k_B T \\ln(2)$. If it is found in the right half, the partition is at $L/2$ and moves to $0$, which is equivalent to an expansion of the container from a length of $L/2$ to $L$. The work extracted is also $k_B T \\ln(2)$. Since the work extracted is identical for both outcomes of the measurement, the average work extracted during the expansion phase is simply this value.\n\nLet $W_{\\text{left}}$ be the work extracted if the particle is found on the left, and $W_{\\text{right}}$ be the work for the right.\n$$W_{\\text{left}} = k_B T \\ln(2)$$\n$$W_{\\text{right}} = k_B T \\ln(2)$$\nThe average work $\\langle W \\rangle$ is given by:\n$$\\langle W \\rangle = P(\\text{left}) W_{\\text{left}} + P(\\text{right}) W_{\\text{right}}$$\n$$\\langle W \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} (k_B T \\ln(2)) + \\frac{1}{2} (k_B T \\ln(2)) = k_B T \\ln(2)$$\nTherefore, the maximum average work extracted during the isothermal expansion step is $k_B T \\ln(2)$.",

A feedback controller (Maxwell’s demon) implements a Szilard cycle as follows under quasistatic, reversible conditions: (i) insert a frictionless, impenetrable partition at the midpoint, instantaneously creating two disjoint wells of length $L/2$; (ii) perform a projective measurement that reveals whether the particle is in the left or right half; (iii) use that measurement outcome to let the particle expand isothermally and quasistatically by slowly moving the partition to the far wall, allowing the occupied half to regain the full length $L$ while remaining in contact with the bath; (iv) remove the partition; (v) erase the demon’s one-bit memory reversibly by coupling it to the same bath at temperature $T$ and resetting it to a standard state.\n\nAdopt the sign conventions $W>0$ for work done by the particle (working system) on the external controller and $Q>0$ for heat absorbed by the particle from the bath.

Starting from the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the definition of Helmholtz free energy $F=-k_{B}T\\ln Z$ (with $Z$ the canonical partition function), and standard properties of reversible isothermal transformations, compute the heat absorbed $Q$ and work $W$ during each step (i)–(v), and then determine the net work over the full cycle including erasure. Express the final answer for the net work in Joules. No numerical approximation or rounding is required; provide an exact result.",
            "solution": "To determine the net work over a full, reversible Szilard cycle, we will compute the work done ($W$) and heat absorbed ($Q$) for each of the five specified steps. We adopt the sign conventions that $W > 0$ for work done by the system (particle or memory) and $Q > 0$ for heat absorbed by the system. For any reversible, isothermal process, the work done by the system is equal to the decrease in its Helmholtz free energy ($W = -\\Delta F$), and the heat absorbed is $Q = T \\Delta S$.\n\n**Step (i): Insertion of the partition**\nThis is an instantaneous process (a quench) that changes the Hamiltonian but occurs too quickly for work to be done or heat to be exchanged.\n$$W_i = 0$$\n$$Q_i = 0$$\n\n**Step (ii): Measurement**\nThis is an information-gathering step that collapses the particle's state but does not involve work or heat exchange with the thermal bath.\n$$W_{ii} = 0$$\n$$Q_{ii} = 0$$\nThe outcome ('left' or 'right', each with probability 1/2) is stored in the demon's memory, corresponding to $I = \\ln 2$ nats of information.\n\n**Step (iii): Isothermal expansion**\nThe demon uses its knowledge to let the particle expand isothermally and reversibly from length $L/2$ to $L$. The work done *by* the particle is equal to the decrease in its Helmholtz free energy. As shown in the previous hands-on problem (or by noting that the process converts 1 bit of information to work), this is:\n$$W_{iii} = k_{B}T \\ln 2$$\nTo find the heat absorbed, we consider the particle's subsystem over steps (i) through (iv), which form a complete cycle, returning the particle to its initial state. Therefore, the net change in the particle's internal energy is zero, $\\Delta U_{particle} = 0$. Applying the First Law to the particle's cycle: $\\Delta U_{particle} = Q_{particle} - W_{particle}$. The total work done by the particle is $W_{particle} = W_i + W_{ii} + W_{iii} + W_{iv} = k_B T \\ln 2$. The total heat absorbed is $Q_{particle} = Q_i + Q_{ii} + Q_{iii} + Q_{iv} = Q_{iii}$. Thus, $0 = Q_{iii} - k_B T \\ln 2$, which gives:\n$$Q_{iii} = k_{B}T \\ln 2$$\n\n**Step (iv): Removal of the partition**\nThe particle already occupies the full length $L$. Removing the partition from the wall does not affect the particle's state. No work is done, and no heat is exchanged.\n$$W_{iv} = 0$$\n$$Q_{iv} = 0$$\n\n**Step (v): Erasure of the demon's memory**\nTo complete the cycle for the entire engine, the demon's one-bit memory must be reset. It starts in a maximum-entropy state (holding the random outcome), with entropy $S_{mem, initial} = k_{B}\\ln 2$. Erasure resets it to a single known state with zero entropy, $S_{mem, final} = 0$. The entropy change of the memory is $\\Delta S_{mem} = -k_{B}\\ln 2$.\nFor this reversible process, the heat absorbed by the memory is $Q_v = T \\Delta S_{mem} = -k_{B}T\\ln 2$. The negative sign indicates heat is expelled into the bath.\nAssuming the memory's internal energy is unchanged in an isothermal process ($\\Delta U_{mem}=0$), the First Law ($ \\Delta U_{mem} = Q_v - W_v $) gives the work done *by* the memory system:\n$$W_v = Q_v - \\Delta U_{mem} = -k_{B}T\\ln 2$$\nThis negative sign indicates that work must be done *on* the memory to erase it.\n\n**Net Work**\nThe net work for the complete engine cycle is the sum of all work contributions:\n$$W_{net} = W_i + W_{ii} + W_{iii} + W_{iv} + W_v$$\n$$W_{net} = 0 + 0 + k_{B}T\\ln 2 + 0 + (-k_{B}T\\ln 2)$$\n$$W_{net} = k_{B}T\\ln 2 - k_{B}T\\ln 2 = 0$$\nThe work gained from the expansion is precisely balanced by the work required to erase the information used to enable that expansion.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimal average heat dissipated into the environment during a quasistatic, isothermal erasure protocol.\n\nAccording to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in the internal energy of the system, $\\Delta U$, is given by $\\Delta U = Q + W$, where $Q$ is the heat absorbed by the system and $W$ is the work done on the system. The heat dissipated into the environment is $Q_{diss} = -Q$. Therefore, $Q_{diss} = W - \\Delta U$.\n\nThe process is specified as quasistatic and isothermal.

The work done on the system is equal to the change in its Helmholtz free energy, $W_{rev} = \\Delta F$. The minimal heat dissipation corresponds to this reversible limit. Any irreversibility would lead to greater dissipation. Thus, the minimal heat dissipated is $Q_{diss, min} = -Q_{rev} = -T \\Delta S$.\n\nOur task is to calculate the change in entropy of the system, $\\Delta S = S_{final} - S_{initial}$.
