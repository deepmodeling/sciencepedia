            "solution": "This problem requires a two-part demonstration of a fundamental result in quantum statistical mechanics, first from the static equilibrium perspective of the canonical Gibbs state, and second from the dynamic perspective of an open quantum system described by a master equation. The goal is to derive the thermal population ratio for a two-level system (qubit).\n\nPart 1: Derivation from the Canonical Gibbs State\n\nThe system is a single qubit with a Hamiltonian given by $H_{S}=\\omega\\,|e\\rangle\\langle e|$. The energy eigenvalues are $E_g = 0$ for the ground state $|g\\rangle$ and $E_e = \\omega$ for the excited state $|e\\rangle$, with $\\omega > 0$. When this qubit reaches thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at inverse temperature $\\beta$, its state is described by the canonical Gibbs density operator:\n$$ \\rho_S^{\\text{th}} = \\frac{1}{Z_S} \\exp(-\\beta H_S) $$\nwhere $Z_S$ is the partition function, defined as the trace of the exponential term:\n$$ Z_S = \\text{Tr}\\left[\\exp(-\\beta H_S)\\right] $$\nTo calculate the partition function, we express the trace in the energy eigenbasis $\\{|g\\rangle, |e\\rangle\\}$:\n$$ Z_S = \\langle g | \\exp(-\\beta H_S) | g \\rangle + \\langle e | \\exp(-\\beta H_S) | e \\rangle $$\nSince $|g\\rangle$ and $|e\\rangle$ are eigenstates of $H_S$, the operator $\\exp(-\\beta H_S)$ is diagonal in this basis:\n$$ \\exp(-\\beta H_S) |g\\rangle = \\exp(-\\beta E_g) |g\\rangle = \\exp(-\\beta \\cdot 0) |g\\rangle = 1 \\cdot |g\\rangle $$\n$$ \\exp(-\\beta H_S) |e\\rangle = \\exp(-\\beta E_e) |e\\rangle = \\exp(-\\beta \\omega) |e\\rangle $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $Z_S$:\n$$ Z_S = 1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega) $$\nNow we can write the full expression for the Gibbs density operator:\n$$ \\rho_S^{\\text{th}} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta (0 \\cdot |g\\rangle\\langle g| + \\omega \\cdot |e\\rangle\\langle e|))}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)} = \\frac{1 \\cdot |g\\rangle\\langle g| + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega) |e\\rangle\\langle e|}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)} $$\nThe populations of the ground state, $p_g$, and the excited state, $p_e$, are the diagonal elements of the density matrix in the energy eigenbasis. They are calculated as the expectation values of the corresponding projection operators:\n$$ p_g = \\langle g | \\rho_S^{\\text{th}} | g \\rangle = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)} $$\n$$ p_e = \\langle e | \\rho_S^{\\text{th}} | e \\rangle = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)} $$\nThe ratio of the excited state population to the ground state population is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{p_e}{p_g} = \\frac{\\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}}{\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta \\omega)}} = \\exp(-\\beta \\omega) $$\nThis is the Boltzmann factor for the energy gap $\\omega$.\n\nPart 2: Derivation from the Quantum Master Equation and Detailed Balance\n\nThe thermal reset step in Heat-Bath Algorithmic Cooling (HBAC) involves the thermalization of the reset qubit with a cold reservoir. This process is modeled dynamically using a quantum master equation for the qubit's density operator $\\rho_S(t)$. Under the standard Born-Markov and secular approximations for weak coupling, the evolution of the populations $p_e(t) = \\langle e | \\rho_S(t) | e \\rangle$ and $p_g(t) = \\langle g | \\rho_S(t) | g \\rangle$ is governed by a set of classical rate equations:\n$$ \\frac{dp_e}{dt} = \\Gamma_{\\uparrow} p_g - \\Gamma_{\\downarrow} p_e $$\n$$ \\frac{dp_g}{dt} = \\Gamma_{\\downarrow} p_e - \\Gamma_{\\uparrow} p_g $$\nHere, $\\Gamma_{\\downarrow}$ is the downward transition rate from $|e\\rangle$ to $|g\\rangle$ (emission), and $\\Gamma_{\\uparrow}$ is the upward transition rate from $|g\\rangle$ to $|e\\rangle$ (absorption).\n\nThese rates are given by Fermi's Golden Rule and are proportional to the squared magnitude of the system operator matrix element connecting the states and the spectral density of the bath at the transition frequency. The interaction is $H_{SB} = \\lambda A \\otimes B$. The rates are:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\downarrow} \\propto |\\langle g|A|e\\rangle|^2 S(\\omega) $$\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\uparrow} \\propto |\\langle e|A|g\\rangle|^2 S(-\\omega) $$\nHere, $S(\\nu) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\, e^{-i\\nu\\tau} \\langle B(\\tau) B(0) \\rangle_{\\text{bath}}$ is the Fourier transform of the reservoir correlation function $\\langle B(\\tau) B(0) \\rangle_{\\text{bath}} = \\text{Tr}_B[\\rho_B^{\\text{th}} B(\\tau) B(0)]$. The transition $|e\\rangle \\to |g\\rangle$ releases energy $\\omega$ to the bath, so its rate is proportional to the bath's response at frequency $\\omega$, i.e., $S(\\omega)$. Conversely, the transition $|g\\rangle \\to |e\\rangle$ requires the absorption of energy $\\omega$ from the bath, so its rate is proportional to the bath's response at frequency $-\\omega$, i.e., $S(-\\omega)$.\n\nThe crucial link between these two rates is provided by the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition, a fundamental property of thermal correlation functions. For a bath at inverse temperature $\\beta$, the KMS condition relates the spectral density at positive and negative frequencies (in units where $\\hbar=1$):\n$$ S(-\\omega) = \\exp(-\\beta \\omega) S(\\omega) $$\nThis relation reflects the fact that it is exponentially less likely for a thermal bath to provide a quantum of energy $\\omega$ than to absorb one.\n\nAssuming the system operator $A$ is Hermitian, we have $|\\langle g|A|e\\rangle|^2 = |\\langle e|A|g\\rangle|^2$. The ratio of the transition rates is then given by:\n$$ \\frac{\\Gamma_{\\uparrow}}{\\Gamma_{\\downarrow}} = \\frac{|\\langle e|A|g\\rangle|^2 S(-\\omega)}{|\\langle g|A|e\\rangle|^2 S(\\omega)} = \\frac{S(-\\omega)}{S(\\omega)} = \\exp(-\\beta \\omega) $$\nThe system reaches a steady state when the populations no longer change, i.e., $\\frac{dp_e}{dt} = 0$. This leads to the principle of detailed balance, where the total flow of population out of each state equals the total flow into it:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\uparrow} p_g^{\\text{ss}} = \\Gamma_{\\downarrow} p_e^{\\text{ss}} $$\nwhere $p_g^{\\text{ss}}$ and $p_e^{\\text{ss}}$ are the steady-state populations. Rearranging this equation gives the ratio of the steady-state populations:\n$$ \\frac{p_e^{\\text{ss}}}{p_g^{\\text{ss}}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_{\\uparrow}}{\\Gamma_{\\downarrow}} $$\nSubstituting the rate ratio derived from the KMS condition, we find:\n$$ \\frac{p_e^{\\text{ss}}}{p_g^{\\text{ss}}} = \\exp(-\\beta \\omega) $$\nThis result demonstrates that the steady state of the open quantum system dynamics is precisely the thermal Gibbs state derived from equilibrium statistical mechanics. The equality of the results from both approaches confirms the consistency of the theoretical framework describing thermalization in quantum systems.",

The system comprises one target qubit, one scratch qubit, and one reset qubit. The reset qubit is coupled to a thermal reservoir (heat bath) of inverse temperature $\\beta$ and energy splitting $\\Delta$, and, upon each reset operation, is prepared in a Gibbs state with polarization $\\epsilon = \\tanh(\\beta \\Delta / 2)$. Polarization for any qubit is defined as $\\epsilon = p_{0} - p_{1}$, where $p_{0}$ and $p_{1}$ are the populations of the computational basis states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, respectively, with $p_{0} + p_{1} = 1$.

            "solution": "We analyze the system in the stationary state (the fixed point of the iterative process), where the state of the computational register (target T and scratch S) becomes invariant under one full HBAC cycle. We assume the density matrix remains diagonal in the computational basis throughout the process, so we can work with the populations of the basis states.\n\n**1. State Representation and Reset Condition**\nThe state of the three-qubit system (T, S, R) is described by the 8 populations $p_{i_T i_S i_R}$ of the basis states $|i_T i_S i_R\\rangle$. The reset qubit (R) is prepared in a thermal Gibbs state with polarization $\\epsilon$. Its populations are $p_0^R = (1+\\epsilon)/2$ and $p_1^R = (1-\\epsilon)/2$. This imposes a fixed ratio between any pair of three-qubit state populations that differ only in the state of the reset qubit:\n$$q \\equiv \\frac{p_0^R}{p_1^R} = \\frac{1+\\epsilon}{1-\\epsilon}$$\nLet $P_{i_T i_S}$ be the population of the state $|i_T i_S\\rangle$ in the two-qubit computational register. After thermalization of the reset qubit, the three-qubit populations are $p_{i_T i_S i_R} = P_{i_T i_S} \\cdot p_{i_R}^R$.\n\n**2. The Fixed-Point Condition and Population Pattern**\nThe PPA algorithm's fixed point is characterized by a specific population structure in the computational register. The four populations of the T+S register, when sorted in descending order, $P_{(0)} \\ge P_{(1)} \\ge P_{(2)} \\ge P_{(3)}$, form a geometric progression with the same ratio $q$:\n$$\\frac{P_{(k)}}{P_{(k+1)}} = q \\quad \\text{for } k=0, 1, 2$$\nThis condition ensures that the spectrum of the three-qubit state has degeneracies that are preserved by the sorting unitary, leading to a stable fixed point. The sorted populations of the computational register are therefore proportional to $\\{1, q^{-1}, q^{-2}, q^{-3}\\}$. The spectrum of the full three-qubit system just before compression consists of the eight values $\\{P_{(k)} p_{i_R}^R\\}$. Using the fixed-point condition $P_{(k+1)} = P_{(k)}q^{-1}$ and the relation $p_1^R = p_0^R q^{-1}$, we find spectral degeneracies:\n$$P_{(k+1)} p_0^R = (P_{(k)}q^{-1})p_0^R = P_{(k)}(q^{-1}p_0^R) = P_{(k)}p_1^R$$\nThis means the sorted list of the eight three-qubit populations is proportional to $\\{q, 1, 1, q^{-1}, q^{-1}, q^{-2}, q^{-2}, q^{-3}\\}$.\n\n**3. The Compression Step and Final Polarization**\nThe compression unitary sorts these eight populations and assigns the four largest to the four basis states where the target qubit is $|0\\rangle$, and the four smallest to the states where the target is $|1\\rangle$.\nThe total population of the target's $|0\\rangle$ state, $p_0^T$, is the sum of the four largest values, while the population of the $|1\\rangle$ state, $p_1^T$, is the sum of the four smallest. The asymptotic polarization of the target qubit is $\\epsilon_T = p_0^T - p_1^T$. Normalizing the populations correctly, we can write:\n$$\\epsilon_T = \\frac{(q + 1 + 1 + q^{-1}) - (q^{-1} + q^{-2} + q^{-2} + q^{-3})}{(q + 1 + 1 + q^{-1}) + (q^{-1} + q^{-2} + q^{-2} + q^{-3})}$$\n$$\\epsilon_T = \\frac{q + 2 - 2q^{-2} - q^{-3}}{q + 2 + 2q^{-1} + 2q^{-2} + q^{-3}}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $q^3$ and factoring gives:\n$$\\epsilon_T = \\frac{q^4 + 2q^3 - 2q - 1}{q^4 + 2q^3 + 2q^2 + 2q + 1} = \\frac{(q-1)(q+1)^3}{(q^2+1)(q+1)^2} = \\frac{(q-1)(q+1)}{q^2+1} = \\frac{q^2-1}{q^2+1}$$\nNow, we substitute $q = \\frac{1+\\epsilon}{1-\\epsilon}$:\n$$q^2-1 = \\left(\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{1-\\epsilon}\\right)^2 - 1 = \\frac{(1+2\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2) - (1-2\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2)}{(1-\\epsilon)^2} = \\frac{4\\epsilon}{(1-\\epsilon)^2}$$\n$$q^2+1 = \\left(\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{1-\\epsilon}\\right)^2 + 1 = \\frac{(1+2\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2) + (1-2\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2)}{(1-\\epsilon)^2} = \\frac{2(1+\\epsilon^2)}{(1-\\epsilon)^2}$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\epsilon_T = \\frac{q^2-1}{q^2+1} = \\frac{4\\epsilon/(1-\\epsilon)^2}{2(1+\\epsilon^2)/(1-\\epsilon)^2} = \\frac{4\\epsilon}{2(1+\\epsilon^2)} = \\frac{2\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon^2}$$\nTo prove that $|\\epsilon_T|  1$ for $|\\epsilon|  1$, we examine the inequality $|\\frac{2\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon^2}|  1$. This is equivalent to $2|\\epsilon|  1+\\epsilon^2$, which can be rewritten as $1 - 2|\\epsilon| + |\\epsilon|^2  0$, or $(1 - |\\epsilon|)^2  0$. Since we are given $|\\epsilon|  1$, it follows that $|\\epsilon| \\neq 1$, so $1 - |\\epsilon| \\neq 0$. The square of any non-zero real number is strictly positive, so the inequality holds.

The denominator is also positive for any $\\epsilon \\in (-1,1)$. Thus, $f'(\\epsilon) > 0$, which means $f(\\epsilon)$ is strictly monotonically increasing.\nThe function $f(\\epsilon)$ maps the interval $[-1, 1]$ to $[-(1-\\gamma), 1-\\gamma] \\subset [-1, 1]$.\nA graphical analysis of $y=f(\\epsilon)$ and $y=\\epsilon$ shows that for any initial $\\epsilon_0 \\in (-1, 1)$, the sequence $\\epsilon_{n+1}=f(\\epsilon_n)$ is monotonic and bounded, and therefore converges. Since $\\epsilon_{\\star}$ is the unique fixed point in this interval, the sequence must converge to it.
