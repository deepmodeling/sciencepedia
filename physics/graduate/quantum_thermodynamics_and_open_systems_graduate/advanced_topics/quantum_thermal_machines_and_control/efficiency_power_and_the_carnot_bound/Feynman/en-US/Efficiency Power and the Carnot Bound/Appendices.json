The average energy of the system is given by $E = \\text{Tr}(\\rho H)$. If a unitary transformation $U$ is applied to the system, the state becomes $\\rho' = U\\rho U^\\dagger$, and the new energy is $E' = \\text{Tr}(\\rho' H)$. The work extracted is the decrease in the system's average energy, $W_{ext} = E - E' = \\text{Tr}(\\rho H) - \\text{Tr}(U\\rho U^\\dagger H)$.\n\nTo maximize the extracted work, one must minimize the final energy $E'$. The state that has the minimum possible energy under any unitary transformation is called a passive state. A state $\\sigma$ is passive with respect to a Hamiltonian $H$ if it is diagonal in the energy eigenbasis and its populations (diagonal elements) are ordered opposite to the energy eigenvalues. That is, the largest population corresponds to the lowest energy level, the second largest population to the second lowest energy level, and so on. No work can be extracted from a passive state via unitary operations.\n\nThe principle of unitary invariance of the spectrum of $\\rho$ dictates that the eigenvalues of the final state $\\rho'$ must be the same as the eigenvalues of the initial state $\\rho$. Let the eigenvalues of $\\rho$ be $\\{r_i\\}$ and the eigenvalues of $H$ be $\\{E_i\\}$. The minimum possible final energy, $E_{pas}$, is achieved by the passive state $\\rho_{pas}$, which has the same eigenvalues as $\\rho$ but is diagonal in the basis of $H$ with its populations anti-ordered with respect to energy.\n$$\nE_{pas} = \\min_{U} \\text{Tr}(U\\rho U^\\dagger H) = \\sum_i r_{i\\downarrow} E_{i\\uparrow}\n$$\nwhere $r_{i\\downarrow}$ are the eigenvalues of $\\rho$ sorted in descending order and $E_{i\\uparrow}$ are the eigenvalues of $H$ sorted in ascending order. The ergotropy is then the difference between the initial energy and this minimum possible energy:\n$$\n\\mathcal{W} = \\text{Tr}(\\rho H) - E_{pas} = \\text{Tr}(\\rho H) - \\text{Tr}(\\rho_{pas} H)\n$$\n\nWe now apply this framework to the given problem.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial energy, $E_{initial}$:**\n    $$\n    E_{initial} = \\text{Tr}(\\rho H) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0.7 & 0.2 \\\\ 0.2 & 0.3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\hbar\\omega \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0.2\\hbar\\omega \\\\ 0 & 0.3\\hbar\\omega \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0.3\\hbar\\omega\n    $$\n\n2.  **Calculate the eigenvalues of $\\rho$:**\n    The characteristic equation is $\\det(\\rho - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n    $$\n    (0.7 - \\lambda)(0.3 - \\lambda) - (0.2)^2 = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\lambda^2 - \\lambda + 0.21 - 0.04 = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\lambda^2 - \\lambda + 0.17 = 0\n    $$\n    The eigenvalues are $r_{\\pm} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(0.17)}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 0.68}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{0.32}}{2}$.\n    Let's order them: $r_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{0.32}}{2}$ and $r_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{0.32}}{2}$.\n\n3.  **Construct the passive state $\\rho_{pas}$ and calculate its energy $E_{pas}$:**\n    The energy eigenvalues are $E_0=0$ and $E_1=\\hbar\\omega$, with $E_0 < E_1$.

The net work done by the system in one cycle is the ergotropy $\\mathcal{W}$. For the cycle to be complete, the system must be returned from the passive state $\\rho_{pas}$ to its initial state $\\rho$. This requires a non-unitary thermalization process involving heat exchange with the reservoirs at temperatures $T_h$ and $T_c$.\n\nLet $Q_h$ be the heat absorbed by the system from the hot reservoir and $Q_c$ be the heat absorbed by the system from the cold reservoir. For an engine, we expect $Q_h > 0$ and $Q_c < 0$ (heat is rejected to the cold reservoir). The efficiency $\\eta$ is the ratio of the net work done to the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{\\mathcal{W}}{Q_h}\n$$\nAccording to the First Law of Thermodynamics, for a complete cycle, the change in internal energy of the system is zero, $\\Delta E_{sys} = 0$. Therefore, the net work done must equal the net heat absorbed:\n$$\n\\mathcal{W} = Q_h + Q_c\n$$\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics, expressed by the Clausius inequality for a cycle, states that the total entropy change of the universe must be non-negative. As the system returns to its initial state, its entropy change over one cycle is zero, $\\Delta S_{sys, cycle} = 0$. The entropy change of the universe is then just the entropy change of the reservoirs, $\\Delta S_{res} = -\\frac{Q_h}{T_h} - \\frac{Q_c}{T_c}$. The Second Law requires $\\Delta S_{res} \\ge 0$.\n$$\n-\\frac{Q_h}{T_h} - \\frac{Q_c}{T_c} \\ge 0 \\implies \\frac{Q_h}{T_h} + \\frac{Q_c}{T_c} \\le 0\n$$\nTo find the upper bound on efficiency, we combine the First and Second Laws. From the First Law, we express $Q_c$ in terms of $\\mathcal{W}$ and $Q_h$: $Q_c = \\mathcal{W} - Q_h$. Substituting this into the inequality from the Second Law:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_h}{T_h} + \\frac{\\mathcal{W} - Q_h}{T_c} \\le 0\n$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\nQ_h\\left(\\frac{1}{T_h} - \\frac{1}{T_c}\\right) + \\frac{\\mathcal{W}}{T_c} \\le 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathcal{W}}{T_c} \\le Q_h\\left(\\frac{1}{T_c} - \\frac{1}{T_h}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathcal{W}}{T_c} \\le Q_h\\left(\\frac{T_h - T_c}{T_h T_c}\\right)\n$$\nMultiplying by $T_c$ (which is positive) and dividing by $Q_h$ (which is positive for an engine):\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathcal{W}}{Q_h} \\le \\frac{T_h - T_c}{T_h}\n$$\nThus, the efficiency $\\eta = \\mathcal{W}/Q_h$ is bounded by the Carnot efficiency:\n$$\n\\eta \\le 1 - \\frac{T_c}{T_h}\n$$\nThe upper bound on the efficiency is therefore $\\eta_{max} = 1 - \\frac{T_c}{T_h}$.\n\nNumerically, with $T_h = 600$ K and $T_c = 300$ K:\n$$\n\\eta_{max} = 1 - \\frac{300 \\, \\text{K}}{600 \\, \\text{K}} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n$$\n\nThe final numerical answers are the calculated ergotropy and the maximum efficiency.\nErgotropy: $\\mathcal{W} = 5.489 \\times 10^{-22}$ J.\nEfficiency bound: $\\eta_{max} = 0.5$.",

The affinity $X_2$ is considered fixed by the constant temperatures of the reservoirs.\n\nFirst, let us express the power $P$ in terms of the affinities.\nFrom the definition of $X_1$, we have $\\Delta\\mu = X_1 T_c$. The particle current is $J_e = L_{11} X_1 + L_{12} X_2$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for power:\n$$\nP = -J_e \\Delta \\mu = -(L_{11} X_1 + L_{12} X_2)(X_1 T_c) = -T_c (L_{11} X_1^2 + L_{12} X_2 X_1)\n$$\nTo find the value of $X_1$ that maximizes the power $P$, we treat $X_2$ as a constant and compute the derivative of $P$ with respect to $X_1$, setting it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dX_1} = -T_c \\frac{d}{dX_1}(L_{11} X_1^2 + L_{12} X_2 X_1) = -T_c (2 L_{11} X_1 + L_{12} X_2)\n$$\nSetting $\\frac{dP}{dX_1} = 0$ gives the optimal value of $X_1$, which we denote as $X_{1, \\star}$:\n$$\n2 L_{11} X_{1, \\star} + L_{12} X_2 = 0 \\implies X_{1, \\star} = -\\frac{L_{12}}{2L_{11}} X_2\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the matrix of Onsager coefficients is positive semidefinite, which implies $L_{11} \\geq 0$.

A solution will be derived based on the provided foundational principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the maximum thermal efficiency, $\\eta$, of the heat engine. The engine operates in a reversible cycle, so its efficiency is governed by the provided thermodynamic laws.\n\nThe definition of thermal efficiency is given as:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{W}{Q_{h}} $$\nHere, $W$ is the net work output and $Q_{h}$ is the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir. For an engine, we must have $W > 0$ and $Q_h > 0$.\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics for a complete cycle, where the internal energy change is zero, is given as:\n$$ W = Q_{h} + Q_{c} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $W$ into the efficiency formula yields:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{Q_{h} + Q_{c}}{Q_{h}} = 1 + \\frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{h}} $$\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics for a reversible cycle is given as:\n$$ \\frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}} + \\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}} = 0 $$\nThe temperatures $T_{h}$ and $T_{c}$ are related to the inverse temperatures $\\beta_{h}$ and $\\beta_{c}$ by $T = \\frac{1}{k_{B}\\beta}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Substituting these relations into the second law equation:\n$$ \\frac{Q_{h}}{1/(k_{B}\\beta_{h})} + \\frac{Q_{c}}{1/(k_{B}\\beta_{c})} = 0 $$\n$$ Q_{h}(k_{B}\\beta_{h}) + Q_{c}(k_{B}\\beta_{c}) = 0 $$\nThe Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$ can be canceled from both terms:\n$$ Q_{h}\\beta_{h} + Q_{c}\\beta_{c} = 0 $$\nThis equation relates the heats $Q_{c}$ and $Q_{h}$ to the inverse temperatures $\\beta_{c}$ and $\\beta_{h}$. We can rearrange this to find the ratio $\\frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{h}}$:\n$$ Q_{c}\\beta_{c} = -Q_{h}\\beta_{h} $$\n$$ \\frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{h}} = -\\frac{\\beta_{h}}{\\beta_{c}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute this ratio back into the expression for efficiency $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta = 1 + \\frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{h}} = 1 + \\left(-\\frac{\\beta_{h}}{\\beta_{c}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\eta = 1 - \\frac{\\beta_{h}}{\\beta_{c}} $$\n\nThis is the final expression for the maximum thermal efficiency of the engine in terms of the given inverse temperatures.\n\nIt is worth noting the physical implication of this result. The problem states that $\\beta_{h} < 0$ and $\\beta_{c} > 0$. Therefore, the ratio $\\frac{\\beta_{h}}{\\beta_{c}}$ is a negative number. This means the efficiency $\\eta$ is greater than $1$.\n$$ \\eta = 1 - (\\text{a negative number}) > 1 $$\nThis is a known result for heat engines operating with a negative-temperature reservoir. From the relation $\\frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{h}} = -\\frac{\\beta_{h}}{\\beta_{c}}$, since the right side is positive, the ratio $\\frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{h}}$ must be positive. Given $Q_h > 0$ for an engine, this implies $Q_c > 0$. Thus, the engine absorbs heat from both the hot and the cold reservoirs and converts the total absorbed heat into work, $W = Q_{h} + Q_{c}$. This allows the efficiency, defined as $\\frac{W}{Q_{h}}$, to be greater than unity, without violating any laws of thermodynamics.",
