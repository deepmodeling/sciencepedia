## Introduction
The evolution of [open quantum systems](@entry_id:138632) is often simplified by assuming the dynamics are "Markovian," meaning the system has no memory of its past. However, many realistic physical systems, from atoms in optical cavities to qubits in a solid-state device, exhibit significant memory effects. Understanding and quantifying these effects, collectively known as non-Markovianity, is a central challenge in modern quantum science. This article addresses the knowledge gap between idealized memoryless models and the complex reality of structured environments by providing a rigorous framework for measuring non-Markovian dynamics.

This article will guide you through the fundamental theory and practical relevance of non-Markovianity measures. In the first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," we will establish the core requirements for physical quantum processes, define Markovianity in terms of complete-positivity (CP) [divisibility](@entry_id:190902), and introduce the key measures that detect its violation, such as the BLP and RHP measures. Next, in "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," we will explore how these theoretical concepts manifest in real-world systems, influencing everything from [quantum optics](@entry_id:140582) and entanglement dynamics to [quantum thermodynamics](@entry_id:140152) and computing. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will provide a set of guided problems to solidify your understanding and apply these principles to concrete physical models.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The description of an open quantum system's evolution hinges on the mathematical properties of the dynamical maps that govern its state. As we move beyond the idealized case of time-homogeneous, memoryless dynamics, we require rigorous criteria to define and quantify the presence of memory effects, or non-Markovianity. This chapter delves into the fundamental principles that underpin such criteria, starting from the basic requirements for a physical quantum process and culminating in a hierarchy of non-Markovianity measures.

### The Requirement of Complete Positivity

A quantum process is described by a dynamical map, $\Phi$, which transforms an initial density operator $\rho(0)$ into a final one, $\rho(t) = \Phi_t[\rho(0)]$. For this map to be physically meaningful, it must transform any valid [density operator](@entry_id:138151) (a positive semidefinite operator with unit trace) into another valid [density operator](@entry_id:138151). A map that sends positive operators to positive operators is known as a **[positive map](@entry_id:1129978)**.

However, the requirement of positivity alone is insufficient for a quantum process. An open system might be part of a larger, entangled system. Consider a system $S$ that is initially entangled with a non-interacting ancillary system $A$. The joint state is described by a [density operator](@entry_id:138151) $\rho_{SA}$ on the composite Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_S \otimes \mathcal{H}_A$. The dynamics of system $S$ is described by the map $\Phi_t$, while the ancilla $A$ remains inert, evolving under the identity map $\mathbb{I}_A$. The evolution of the total system is thus given by the extended map $\Phi_t \otimes \mathbb{I}_A$. For the dynamics to be physical, this extended map must transform any valid joint state $\rho_{SA}$ into another valid joint state. This requires that $\Phi_t \otimes \mathbb{I}_A$ must be a [positive map](@entry_id:1129978) for any choice of ancilla $A$. A map $\Phi_t$ that satisfies this stronger condition is called a **completely positive (CP) map**.

The distinction between positivity and complete positivity is not merely a mathematical subtlety; it is a crucial physical requirement. There exist maps that are positive but not completely positive, and these maps can lead to unphysical predictions. A canonical example is the [matrix transpose](@entry_id:155858) map, $\mathsf{T}$, defined in a specific basis. While the transpose of a positive semidefinite operator is always positive semidefinite (making $\mathsf{T}$ a [positive map](@entry_id:1129978)), its extension can fail dramatically.

Consider a system qubit $S$ and an [ancilla qubit](@entry_id:144604) $A$ prepared in the maximally entangled Bell state $|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$. The corresponding [density operator](@entry_id:138151) is $\rho_{SA} = |\Phi^+\rangle\langle\Phi^+|$. If we apply the [transpose map](@entry_id:152972) $\mathsf{T}$ locally to system $S$, the resulting operator is $(\mathsf{T} \otimes \mathbb{I}_A)[\rho_{SA}]$. A direct calculation shows that this resulting operator has a negative eigenvalue, meaning it is not positive semidefinite and cannot represent a physical state . This demonstrates that a physical dynamical map must be completely positive to ensure that it yields valid physical states under all circumstances, especially in the presence of entanglement. All valid quantum evolutions are therefore described by families of completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) maps.

### Quantum Markovianity and Divisibility

The most elementary form of memoryless [quantum dynamics](@entry_id:138183) is described by a **[quantum dynamical semigroup](@entry_id:1130394)**. This is a family of CPTP maps $\{\Phi_t\}_{t \ge 0}$ that satisfies the [semigroup](@entry_id:153860) law $\Phi_{t+s} = \Phi_t \circ \Phi_s$ for all $t, s \ge 0$, along with certain continuity properties. Such a process is inherently time-homogeneous, meaning the evolution only depends on the duration of the time interval, not its location in time. A cornerstone result in the theory of open quantum systems is that a process forms a [quantum dynamical semigroup](@entry_id:1130394) if and only if it is generated by a time-independent master equation of the Gorini–Kossakowski–Sudarshan–Lindblad (GKSL) form, $\dot{\rho}(t) = \mathcal{L}[\rho(t)]$.

This definition can be reformulated. A process is a time-homogeneous [semigroup](@entry_id:153860) if and only if it is both **completely positive divisible (CP-divisible)** and **time-translation invariant** . Divisibility concerns the ability to factorize the evolution into intermediate steps. A family of maps $\{\Phi_t\}$ is CP-divisible if for any pair of times $t \ge s \ge 0$, the map $\Phi_t$ can be factorized as $\Phi_t = \Phi_{t,s} \circ \Phi_s$, where the intermediate [propagator](@entry_id:139558) $\Phi_{t,s}$ is itself a CPTP map. This is the modern, broader definition of **quantum Markovianity**. It describes a [memoryless process](@entry_id:267313), where the evolution from time $s$ to $t$ is a valid physical process in its own right, independent of the evolution that led to the state at time $s$.

When the dynamics are described by a time-local master equation,
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\rho(t) = \mathcal{L}_t[\rho(t)] = -i[H(t),\rho(t)] + \sum_{k} \gamma_k(t)\left(L_k \rho(t) L_k^\dagger - \frac{1}{2}\{L_k^\dagger L_k,\rho(t)\}\right)
$$
the condition for CP-[divisibility](@entry_id:190902) translates directly to a condition on the generator $\mathcal{L}_t$. The process is CP-divisible if and only if all the time-dependent decoherence rates $\gamma_k(t)$ are non-negative for all times $t \ge 0$. If any rate $\gamma_k(t)$ becomes negative, the generator $\mathcal{L}_t$ temporarily ceases to be of the standard GKSL form, the infinitesimal [propagator](@entry_id:139558) $\Phi_{t+dt, t} \approx \mathbb{I} + \mathcal{L}_t dt$ is not completely positive, and the dynamics is considered non-Markovian . This non-negativity of rates is equivalent to the positivity of the **Kossakowski matrix** that defines the dissipative part of the generator in a basis-independent way.

A weaker condition is **positive [divisibility](@entry_id:190902) (P-[divisibility](@entry_id:190902))**, where the intermediate [propagators](@entry_id:153170) $\Phi_{t,s}$ are required only to be positive and trace-preserving (PTP). Since any CP map is also a P map, all CP-divisible (Markovian) processes are also P-divisible. However, the converse is not true. There exist processes that are P-divisible but not CP-divisible. A well-known example can be constructed using a Pauli channel where one of the decay rates is negative, e.g., $\gamma_x(t) = -1$ while $\gamma_y(t), \gamma_z(t) \ge 0$. The resulting intermediate map preserves the positivity of any single-qubit state (i.e., it maps the Bloch sphere into itself), but its Choi matrix has a negative eigenvalue, revealing that the map is not completely positive. Such a process is P-divisible but not CP-divisible, and is therefore non-Markovian .

### Witnesses and Measures of Non-Markovianity

The failure of CP-[divisibility](@entry_id:190902) is the hallmark of non-Markovianity. To detect and quantify this failure, we employ **non-Markovianity witnesses**. A witness is a physically meaningful functional $W(t)$ of the system's state that is guaranteed to be monotonically non-increasing for any CP-divisible (i.e., Markovian) evolution. A temporary increase in such a witness, $W(t) > W(s)$ for $t>s$, is a definitive signature of non-Markovian dynamics.

Several important quantities in [quantum information theory](@entry_id:141608) serve as such witnesses because they are contractive under the action of local CPTP maps .

#### The BLP Measure: Information Backflow as Revived Distinguishability

One of the most fundamental witnesses is the **[trace distance](@entry_id:142668)**, $D(\rho_1, \rho_2) = \frac{1}{2}\|\rho_1 - \rho_2\|_1$, between two quantum states. Operationally, it quantifies the maximal success probability of distinguishing between the two states. A key property of any CPTP map $\Phi$ is that it is contractive, meaning $D(\Phi(\rho_1), \Phi(\rho_2)) \le D(\rho_1, \rho_2)$. This is a data-processing inequality: processing the states through a physical channel cannot increase their [distinguishability](@entry_id:269889).

For a CP-divisible process, the evolution from time $s$ to $t$ is described by a CPTP map $\Lambda_{t,s}$. Therefore, for any pair of initial states, their [trace distance](@entry_id:142668) must be a monotonically non-increasing function of time . A temporary increase in [trace distance](@entry_id:142668), $\frac{d}{dt}D(\rho_1(t), \rho_2(t)) > 0$, signifies a violation of CP-[divisibility](@entry_id:190902). This phenomenon is termed **[information backflow](@entry_id:146865)**, interpreted as information about the initial state difference, which was lost to the environment, flowing back into the system and causing a revival of [distinguishability](@entry_id:269889).

The **Breuer–Laine–Piilo (BLP) measure of non-Markovianity**, $\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{BLP}}$, quantifies the total amount of this [information backflow](@entry_id:146865):
$$
\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{BLP}} = \max_{\rho_{1,2}} \int_{\dot{D}(t) > 0} \frac{d}{dt} D(\rho_1(t), \rho_2(t)) \, dt
$$
The maximization over all pairs of initial states $(\rho_1, \rho_2)$ is essential. It ensures that the measure becomes an intrinsic property of the dynamical map itself, rather than depending on a specific, potentially insensitive choice of input states. Operationally, it quantifies the largest possible recovery of distinguishability that the non-Markovian channel can provide . A non-zero $\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{BLP}}$ indicates non-Markovianity. In fact, it has been shown that a non-zero $\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{BLP}}$ is equivalent to the process being not P-divisible.

#### The RHP Measure: Entanglement as a Probe for Non-Markovianity

Other contractive quantities can serve as witnesses. Entanglement monotones, such as **[entanglement negativity](@entry_id:144413)**, and correlation measures like **[quantum mutual information](@entry_id:144024)**, are guaranteed to be non-increasing under local CPTP operations on one part of an entangled system . This forms the basis for another important class of measures.

The **Rivas–Huelga–Plenio (RHP) measure of non-Markovianity**, $\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{RHP}}$, is defined by considering the evolution of a system $S$ that is initially maximally entangled with an inert ancilla $A$. The entanglement between $S$ and $A$ can only decrease if the dynamics on $S$ is CP-divisible. Any increase in their entanglement is a clear sign of non-Markovianity. The RHP measure is the total integrated increase of entanglement over time:
$$
\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{RHP}}(T) = \int_0^T \left[\frac{d}{dt} \mathcal{E}(\rho_{SA}(t))\right]_+ dt
$$
where $\mathcal{E}$ is an [entanglement monotone](@entry_id:136743) and $[x]_+ = \max\{x, 0\}$.

A powerful result connects this measure directly to the structure of the generator. For a qubit system with a generator in [canonical form](@entry_id:140237) with rates $\gamma_k(t)$, the instantaneous rate of entanglement generation is given by the sum of the magnitudes of the negative rates :
$$
\left[\frac{d}{dt} \mathcal{E}(\rho_{SA}(t))\right]_+ = \sum_k [-\gamma_k(t)]_+
$$
This provides a direct, computable link between the non-physicality (non-CP nature) of the [infinitesimal generator](@entry_id:270424) and the physical phenomenon of entanglement regeneration. For a given master equation, one can compute the total non-Markovianity by integrating the negative parts of the canonical rates over time. For example, for a qubit with canonical rates given by $\gamma_1(t) = a \sin(\omega t)$, $\gamma_2(t) = b \sin(\omega t + \varphi)$, and $\gamma_3(t)=c \ge 0$, the RHP non-Markovianity over one period $T=2\pi/\omega$ is $\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{RHP}}(T) = \frac{2(a+b)}{\omega}$, arising from the intervals where the sinusoidal rates become negative .

### An Operational Hierarchy: The Process Tensor Formalism

The concepts of CP-[divisibility](@entry_id:190902) and the associated measures (BLP, RHP) characterize the [reduced dynamics](@entry_id:166543) of the system in the absence of interventions. A more general and operationally-grounded framework is the **[process tensor](@entry_id:1130205) formalism**. This approach characterizes a quantum process not by its action on initial states, but by its response to arbitrary interventions (e.g., measurements, control operations) at intermediate times.

The **[process tensor](@entry_id:1130205)**, denoted $\mathcal{T}_{n:0}$ for a process with $n$ time steps, is a [multilinear map](@entry_id:274221) that takes a sequence of quantum instruments (describing the interventions) as inputs and yields the resulting multi-time statistics. In its Choi representation, it is a positive semidefinite operator, often called a **quantum comb**, which encodes all possible temporal correlations of the process.

Within this powerful framework, **quantum Markovianity** is defined as the [conditional independence](@entry_id:262650) of the future from the past, given the present intervention . This means that the statistics of outcomes at time $t_k$ depend on interventions at times prior to $t_{k-1}$ only through their influence on the state at $t_{k-1}$. Formally, this corresponds to the factorization of the quantum comb into a chain of individual CPTP maps, one for each time step. Equivalently, it is defined by the vanishing of the quantum [conditional mutual information](@entry_id:139456), $I(\text{past}:\text{future} | \text{present}) = 0$, for the Choi state of the process .

This operational definition establishes a clear hierarchy of Markovianity:
1.  **Process-Tensor Markovianity:** This is the strongest notion, requiring the absence of temporal correlations that could be revealed by any physical intervention. It implies that the process factorizes into a causal sequence of CPTP maps.
2.  **CP-[divisibility](@entry_id:190902):** This is a weaker condition. If a process is Markovian in the process-tensor sense, its [reduced dynamics](@entry_id:166543) must be CP-divisible. However, the converse is not true. One can construct processes (e.g., using a correlated collision model) that are CP-divisible but possess initial system-environment correlations or [environmental memory](@entry_id:136908) that can be revealed by interventions, thus failing to be process-tensor Markovian .
3.  **P-[divisibility](@entry_id:190902) (No BLP backflow):** This is weaker still. As we have seen, CP-[divisibility](@entry_id:190902) implies P-[divisibility](@entry_id:190902) (the [trace distance](@entry_id:142668) is always non-increasing), but the converse is not true.

In summary, the journey from the idealized [quantum dynamical semigroup](@entry_id:1130394) to the fully general [process tensor](@entry_id:1130205) reveals a rich structure of memory effects in [open quantum systems](@entry_id:138632). While different measures capture different facets of non-Markovian behavior—be it the revival of [distinguishability](@entry_id:269889), the regeneration of entanglement, or the presence of higher-order temporal correlations—they are all rooted in the fundamental properties of complete positivity and the ways in which this property can be violated over the course of an evolution.
