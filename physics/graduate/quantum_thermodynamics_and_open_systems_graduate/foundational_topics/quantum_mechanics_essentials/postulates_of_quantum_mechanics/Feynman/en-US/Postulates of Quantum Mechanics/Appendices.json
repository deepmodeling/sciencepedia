The derivation is a standard mathematical procedure.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to determine the eigenvalues of the operator $\\rho(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})$. A direct but clumsy approach would be to write out the matrix representation and solve the characteristic equation. A more elegant and fundamental method, which adheres to the spirit of the problem statement, is to use the algebraic properties of the Pauli matrices.\n\nLet $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $\\rho(\\vec{r})$ corresponding to an eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n$$ \\rho(\\vec{r}) |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\rho(\\vec{r})$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}) |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle $$\nLet us define the operator $M = \\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}(I + M) |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle $$\n$$ (I + M) |\\psi\\rangle = 2\\lambda |\\psi\\rangle $$\n$$ M |\\psi\\rangle = (2\\lambda - 1) |\\psi\\rangle $$\nThis shows that if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $\\rho(\\vec{r})$, then $\\lambda' = 2\\lambda - 1$ is an eigenvalue of $M$. Conversely, if $\\lambda'$ is an eigenvalue of $M$, then $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\lambda')$ is an eigenvalue of $\\rho(\\vec{r})$. Our problem is thus reduced to finding the eigenvalues of the operator $M = \\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\nWe will find the eigenvalues of $M$ by first computing its square, $M^2$.\n$$ M^2 = (\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})^2 = (\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})(\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}) $$\nA fundamental identity for the Pauli matrices is:\n$$ (\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})(\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}) = (\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b})I + i(\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b})\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma} $$\nwhere $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are any two vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. We apply this identity by setting $\\vec{a} = \\vec{b} = \\vec{r}$.\n$$ M^2 = (\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{r})I + i(\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{r})\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma} $$\nThe cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector, so $\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{r} = \\vec{0}$. The dot product of a vector with itself is the square of its norm, $\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{r} = |\\vec{r}|^2$. The identity simplifies to:\n$$ M^2 = |\\vec{r}|^2 I $$\nNow, let $\\lambda'$ be an eigenvalue of $M$ with corresponding eigenvector $|\\phi\\rangle \\neq 0$.\n$$ M|\\phi\\rangle = \\lambda'|\\phi\\rangle $$\nApplying the operator $M$ to both sides yields:\n$$ M^2|\\phi\\rangle = M(\\lambda'|\\phi\\rangle) = \\lambda' (M|\\phi\\rangle) = \\lambda'(\\lambda'|\\phi\\rangle) = (\\lambda')^2 |\\phi\\rangle $$\nUsing our result for $M^2$, we also have:\n$$ M^2|\\phi\\rangle = (|\\vec{r}|^2 I)|\\phi\\rangle = |\\vec{r}|^2 |\\phi\\rangle $$\nEquating the two expressions for $M^2|\\phi\\rangle$:\n$$ (\\lambda')^2 |\\phi\\rangle = |\\vec{r}|^2 |\\phi\\rangle $$\nSince $|\\phi\\rangle$ is a non-zero vector, we must have:\n$$ (\\lambda')^2 = |\\vec{r}|^2 $$\nThis equation for $\\lambda'$ has two solutions:\n$$ \\lambda' = \\pm \\sqrt{|\\vec{r}|^2} = \\pm |\\vec{r}| $$\nThese are the two eigenvalues of the operator $M = \\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\nFinally, we use the relationship $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\lambda')$ to find the eigenvalues of the density operator $\\rho(\\vec{r})$.\nFor $\\lambda' = +|\\vec{r}|$, we obtain the first eigenvalue, which we denote $\\lambda_+$:\n$$ \\lambda_{+} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + |\\vec{r}|) $$\nFor $\\lambda' = -|\\vec{r}|$, we obtain the second eigenvalue, which we denote $\\lambda_-$:\n$$ \\lambda_{-} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - |\\vec{r}|) $$\nThese are the two eigenvalues of $\\rho(\\vec{r})$ expressed solely as a function of the norm $|\\vec{r}|$. The problem statement requires an ordered pair $(\\lambda_{+}, \\lambda_{-})$. As $|\\vec{r}| \\ge 0$, it is clear that $\\lambda_{+} \\ge \\lambda_{-}$, so this ordering is natural.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\frac{1 \\pm |\\vec{r}|}{2}$. The condition for positive semidefiniteness, $\\lambda_{\\pm} \\ge 0$, requires $1 \\pm |\\vec{r}| \\ge 0$. This implies $|\\vec{r}| \\le 1$, which is consistent with the constraint given in the problem statement. The trace is $\\text{Tr}(\\rho) = \\lambda_{+} + \\lambda_{-} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + |\\vec{r}|) + \\frac{1}{2}(1 - |\\vec{r}|) = 1$, as required for a density operator. The derivation is complete and consistent.",

This is most easily computed from the eigenvalues of $\\rho$. For a qubit density matrix represented by a Bloch vector $\\boldsymbol{r}$, the eigenvalues are given by $\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\frac{1 \\pm |\\boldsymbol{r}|}{2}$.\nThe magnitude of the Bloch vector is:\n$$|\\boldsymbol{r}| = \\sqrt{r_x^2 + r_y^2 + r_z^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{\\omega_x}{\\Omega}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\hbar\\Omega}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{\\omega_z}{\\Omega}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\hbar\\Omega}{2}\\right)\\right)^2}$$\n$$|\\boldsymbol{r}| = \\left|\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\hbar\\Omega}{2}\\right)\\right| \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_x^2+\\omega_z^2}{\\Omega^2}} = \\left|\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\hbar\\Omega}{2}\\right)\\right|$$\nSince $\\beta > 0$, $\\hbar > 0$, and $\\Omega \\ge 0$, the argument of the hyperbolic tangent is non-negative, so we can drop the absolute value:\n$$|\\boldsymbol{r}| = \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\hbar\\Omega}{2}\\right)$$\nThe eigenvalues of $\\rho$ are $\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 \\pm \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\hbar\\Omega}{2}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nThe von Neumann entropy in terms of the eigenvalues is $S(\\rho) = -(\\lambda_+\\ln\\lambda_+ + \\lambda_-\\ln\\lambda_-)$.\nLet $x = \\frac{\\beta\\hbar\\Omega}{2} = \\frac{\\beta\\hbar\\sqrt{\\omega_x^2+\\omega_z^2}}{2}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 \\pm \\tanh x)$.\nWe can simplify these expressions:\n$$\\lambda_+ = \\frac{1+\\tanh x}{2} = \\frac{1+\\frac{\\sinh x}{\\cosh x}}{2} = \\frac{\\cosh x + \\sinh x}{2\\cosh x} = \\frac{\\exp(x)}{2\\cosh x}$$\n$$\\lambda_- = \\frac{1-\\tanh x}{2} = \\frac{1-\\frac{\\sinh x}{\\cosh x}}{2} = \\frac{\\cosh x - \\sinh x}{2\\cosh x} = \\frac{\\exp(-x)}{2\\cosh x}$$\nNow, we compute the entropy:\n$$S(\\rho) = -\\left[ \\frac{\\exp(x)}{2\\cosh x} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\exp(x)}{2\\cosh x}\\right) + \\frac{\\exp(-x)}{2\\cosh x} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\exp(-x)}{2\\cosh x}\\right) \\right]$$\nUsing $\\ln(a/b) = \\ln a - \\ln b$:\n$$S(\\rho) = -\\left[ \\frac{\\exp(x)}{2\\cosh x} (x - \\ln(2\\cosh x)) + \\frac{\\exp(-x)}{2\\cosh x} (-x - \\ln(2\\cosh x)) \\right]$$\n$$S(\\rho) = -\\frac{1}{2\\cosh x} \\left[ x\\exp(x) - \\exp(x)\\ln(2\\cosh x) - x\\exp(-x) - \\exp(-x)\\ln(2\\cosh x) \\right]$$\n$$S(\\rho) = -\\frac{1}{2\\cosh x} \\left[ x(\\exp(x) - \\exp(-x)) - (\\exp(x) + \\exp(-x))\\ln(2\\cosh x) \\right]$$\nUsing the definitions $\\sinh x = \\frac{\\exp(x)-\\exp(-x)}{2}$ and $\\cosh x = \\frac{\\exp(x)+\\exp(-x)}{2}$:\n$$S(\\rho) = -\\frac{1}{2\\cosh x} \\left[ x(2\\sinh x) - (2\\cosh x)\\ln(2\\cosh x) \\right]$$\n$$S(\\rho) = -\\left( x\\frac{\\sinh x}{\\cosh x} - \\ln(2\\cosh x) \\right)$$\n$$S(\\rho) = \\ln(2\\cosh x) - x\\tanh x$$\nSubstituting back the expression for $x$:\n$$S(\\rho) = \\ln\\left(2\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\hbar\\sqrt{\\omega_x^2+\\omega_z^2}}{2}\\right)\\right) - \\frac{\\beta\\hbar\\sqrt{\\omega_x^2+\\omega_z^2}}{2}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\hbar\\sqrt{\\omega_x^2+\\omega_z^2}}{2}\\right)$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the von Neumann entropy.",
