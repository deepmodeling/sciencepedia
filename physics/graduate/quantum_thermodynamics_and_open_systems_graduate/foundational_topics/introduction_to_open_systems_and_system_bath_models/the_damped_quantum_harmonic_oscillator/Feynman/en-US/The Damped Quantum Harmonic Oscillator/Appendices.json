            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard initial value problem in the context of open quantum systems, specifically the damped quantum harmonic oscillator described by the Caldeira-Leggett model under the Born-Markov approximation. All provided information is self-consistent and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the time evolution of the expectation value of the position operator, $\\langle x(t) \\rangle$, which is governed by the second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\\mathrm{d} t^{2}}\\langle x(t)\\rangle + \\gamma \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}\\langle x(t)\\rangle + \\tilde{\\omega}_{0}^{2}\\langle x(t)\\rangle = 0\n$$\nTo simplify notation, let $y(t) = \\langle x(t) \\rangle$. The equation is then $y''(t) + \\gamma y'(t) + \\tilde{\\omega}_{0}^{2} y(t) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we diagonalize the dynamics by finding the roots of the characteristic equation, which correspond to the complex frequencies of the system's fundamental modes. The characteristic equation is:\n$$\n\\lambda^{2} + \\gamma \\lambda + \\tilde{\\omega}_{0}^{2} = 0\n$$\nThe roots, $\\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2}$, are found using the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{-\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{\\gamma^{2} - 4\\tilde{\\omega}_{0}^{2}}}{2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the weak-damping regime, defined by the condition $\\gamma < 2 \\tilde{\\omega}_{0}$, which implies $\\gamma^{2} < 4\\tilde{\\omega}_{0}^{2}$. Consequently, the discriminant $\\gamma^{2} - 4\\tilde{\\omega}_{0}^{2}$ is negative. We can write the roots in terms of a real damped frequency, $\\omega_{1}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{-\\gamma \\pm i\\sqrt{4\\tilde{\\omega}_{0}^{2} - \\gamma^{2}}}{2} = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\pm i \\sqrt{\\tilde{\\omega}_{0}^{2} - \\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{4}}\n$$\nLet us define the damped frequency as $\\omega_{1} = \\sqrt{\\tilde{\\omega}_{0}^{2} - \\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{4}}$. The complex frequencies of the fundamental modes are therefore:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1} = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2} + i\\omega_{1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda_{2} = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2} - i\\omega_{1}\n$$\nThe general solution for $y(t) = \\langle x(t) \\rangle$ is a linear combination of the fundamental solutions $e^{\\lambda_{1}t}$ and $e^{\\lambda_{2}t}$:\n$$\n\\langle x(t) \\rangle = C_{1} e^{\\lambda_{1}t} + C_{2} e^{\\lambda_{2}t} = e^{-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}} (C_{1}e^{i\\omega_{1}t} + C_{2}e^{-i\\omega_{1}t})\n$$\nSince $\\langle x(t) \\rangle$ must be a real quantity, the constants $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ must be complex conjugates. It is more convenient to express the general solution in terms of real constants $A$ and $B$ using Euler's formula:\n$$\n\\langle x(t) \\rangle = e^{-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}} (A\\cos(\\omega_{1}t) + B\\sin(\\omega_{1}t))\n$$\nNext, we apply the initial conditions to determine the constants $A$ and $B$. The problem provides the initial expectation values for position and momentum at $t=0$:\n1. $\\langle x(0) \\rangle = x_{0}$\n2. $\\langle p(0) \\rangle = p_{0}$\n\nFrom the first condition, we evaluate the solution at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\langle x(0) \\rangle = e^{0} (A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0)) = A\n$$\nThus, we find $A=x_{0}$.\n\nFor the second condition, we need the initial value of the first time derivative of $\\langle x(t) \\rangle$. Within the framework of quantum mechanics, the time derivative of the position operator $x$ in the Heisenberg picture is related to the momentum operator $p$. Specifically, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}[x, H]$. The interaction Hamiltonian $H_I = x \\otimes B$ commutes with $x$. The bath Hamiltonian $H_B$ also commutes with the system operator $x$. Therefore, the commutator is determined solely by the system Hamiltonian $H_S = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_0^2 x^2$, which yields the standard relation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{p}{m}$. Taking the expectation value gives $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\langle x(t) \\rangle}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\langle p(t) \\rangle}{m}$. At $t=0$, this gives the initial condition for the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\langle x(t) \\rangle}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\bigg|_{t=0} = \\frac{\\langle p(0) \\rangle}{m} = \\frac{p_{0}}{m}\n$$\nNow, we differentiate our general solution for $\\langle x(t) \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\langle x(t) \\rangle}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2}e^{-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}}(A\\cos(\\omega_{1}t) + B\\sin(\\omega_{1}t)) + e^{-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}}(-\\omega_{1}A\\sin(\\omega_{1}t) + \\omega_{1}B\\cos(\\omega_{1}t))\n$$\nEvaluating this derivative at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\langle x(t) \\rangle}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\bigg|_{t=0} = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2}(A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0)) + (-\\omega_{1}A\\sin(0) + \\omega_{1}B\\cos(0)) = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2}A + \\omega_{1}B\n$$\nSubstituting the known values for the initial derivative and the constant $A$:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{0}}{m} = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2}x_{0} + \\omega_{1}B\n$$\nSolving for $B$:\n$$\n\\omega_{1}B = \\frac{p_{0}}{m} + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}x_{0} \\implies B = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{1}}\\left(\\frac{p_{0}}{m} + \\frac{\\gamma x_{0}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $A$ and $B$ back into the general solution for $\\langle x(t) \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle x(t) \\rangle = e^{-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}} \\left[ x_{0}\\cos(\\omega_{1}t) + \\frac{1}{\\omega_{1}}\\left(\\frac{p_{0}}{m} + \\frac{\\gamma x_{0}}{2}\\right)\\sin(\\omega_{1}t) \\right]\n$$\nTo present the final answer exclusively in terms of the given parameters $x_0, p_0, m, \\tilde{\\omega}_0$, and $\\gamma$, we substitute $\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\tilde{\\omega}_0^2 - \\frac{\\gamma^2}{4}}$ and collect the terms multiplying $\\sin(\\omega_1 t)$:\n$$\n\\langle x(t) \\rangle = e^{-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}} \\left[ x_{0}\\cos(\\omega_{1}t) + \\left(\\frac{\\gamma x_0}{2\\omega_1} + \\frac{p_0}{m\\omega_1}\\right)\\sin(\\omega_{1}t) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\langle x(t) \\rangle = e^{-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}} \\left[ x_{0}\\cos(\\omega_{1}t) + \\frac{x_0\\gamma + \\frac{2 p_0}{m}}{2\\omega_1}\\sin(\\omega_{1}t) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the full expression for $\\omega_1$ gives the final closed-form expression for the time evolution of the position expectation value.\n$$\n\\langle x(t) \\rangle = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}\\right) \\left[ x_{0}\\cos\\left(t\\sqrt{\\tilde{\\omega}_0^2 - \\frac{\\gamma^2}{4}}\\right) + \\frac{x_{0}\\gamma + \\frac{2 p_{0}}{m}}{2\\sqrt{\\tilde{\\omega}_0^2 - \\frac{\\gamma^2}{4}}}\\sin\\left(t\\sqrt{\\tilde{\\omega}_0^2 - \\frac{\\gamma^2}{4}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $t \\ge 0$ under the weak-damping condition $\\gamma < 2 \\tilde{\\omega}_{0}$.",

The starting points are the given Heisenberg-Langevin equation and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT).\n\nThe Heisenberg-Langevin equation for the oscillator position operator $x(t)$ is given in the Markovian limit as:\n$$\nm\\,\\ddot{x}(t)+m\\,\\gamma\\,\\dot{x}(t)+m\\,\\omega_{0}^{2}\\,x(t)=\\xi(t)\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass, $\\omega_0$ is the natural frequency, $\\gamma$ is the damping rate, and $\\xi(t)$ is the quantum Langevin force operator originating from the bath.\n\nThe momentum diffusion coefficient $D_{pp}$ is defined through the symmetrized noise correlator in the Markovian approximation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\langle\\left\\{\\xi(t),\\xi(t')\\right\\}\\right\\rangle=2\\,D_{pp}\\,\\delta(t-t')\n$$\nwhere $\\{A,B\\} = AB+BA$ is the anticommutator. This definition implies that the noise is treated as being delta-correlated in time. The Fourier transform of a delta function is a constant, so this corresponds to a flat, or \"white,\" noise spectrum in the frequency domain. Let $S_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega)$ be the power spectrum of the symmetrized noise, defined as the Fourier transform of the time-domain correlator:\n$$\nS_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\, e^{-i\\omega\\tau} \\, \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\langle\\left\\{\\xi(\\tau),\\xi(0)\\right\\}\\right\\rangle\n$$\nApplying the Fourier transform to the definition of $D_{pp}$:\n$$\nS_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\, e^{-i\\omega\\tau} \\, [2\\,D_{pp}\\,\\delta(\\tau)] = 2\\,D_{pp}\n$$\nThis confirms that the diffusion coefficient $D_{pp}$ is, up to a factor of $2$, the constant value of the white noise power spectrum.\n\nHowever, the noise from a physical heat bath is not truly white. The quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) provides the exact, frequency-dependent power spectrum of the noise. For a system with a linear coupling to a bath, whose dissipative influence is characterized by a friction kernel $\\gamma(t)$, the FDT relates the symmetrized noise spectrum $S_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega)$ to the real part of the Fourier-transformed friction kernel, $\\text{Re}[\\tilde{\\gamma}(\\omega)]$.

To reconcile this with the white-noise definition of $D_{pp}$, we must invoke a physical approximation. The Langevin equation describes a harmonic oscillator, which is a resonant system. If the oscillator is weakly damped, meaning its quality factor $Q = \\omega_0/\\gamma \\gg 1$, it responds predominantly to driving forces with frequencies in a narrow band around its resonance frequency $\\omega_0$. Therefore, the evolution of the oscillator is primarily sensitive to the noise power spectral density at $\\omega \\approx \\omega_0$.\n\nUnder this weak-coupling (or high-Q) assumption, it is a standard and well-justified procedure to approximate the colored noise spectrum by its value at the oscillator's natural frequency. This is the essence of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) often used in deriving the master equation for such systems. We replace the full spectrum $S_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega)$ with an effective flat spectrum:\n$$\nS_{\\text{eff}} = S_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega_0) = m\\gamma\\hbar\\omega_0 \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0}{2k_{\\text{B}} T}\\right)\n$$\nBy equating this effective white noise spectrum with $2D_{pp}$, we can determine the diffusion coefficient:\n$$\n2D_{pp} = m\\gamma\\hbar\\omega_0 \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0}{2k_{\\text{B}} T}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $D_{pp}$ yields the final expression:\n$$\nD_{pp} = \\frac{m\\gamma\\hbar\\omega_0}{2} \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0}{2k_{\\text{B}} T}\\right)\n$$\nThis result correctly captures the quantum nature of the fluctuations. In the high-temperature limit where $k_{\\text{B}} T \\gg \\hbar\\omega_0$, we can use the approximation $\\coth(x) \\approx 1/x$, which gives $\\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0}{2k_{\\text{B}} T}\\right) \\approx \\frac{2k_{\\text{B}} T}{\\hbar\\omega_0}$. The expression for $D_{pp}$ then reduces to the classical result $D_{pp} \\approx m\\gamma k_{\\text{B}} T$. In the zero-temperature limit ($T \\to 0$), $\\coth(x) \\to 1$ for $x>0$, yielding $D_{pp} = \\frac{m\\gamma\\hbar\\omega_0}{2}$, which represents diffusion driven purely by quantum vacuum fluctuations of the bath.\n\nThe assumptions required to arrive at a $\\delta$-correlated symmetrized noise are as follows:\n1.  **Markovian Approximation**: The bath correlation time is assumed to be infinitesimally short compared to the characteristic timescales of the oscillator's dynamics ($1/\\omega_0$ and $1/\\gamma$). This is what allows for a time-local description of damping.\n2.  **Weak-Coupling Approximation**: The damping rate is assumed to be much smaller than the oscillator's frequency ($\\gamma \\ll \\omega_0$). This makes the oscillator a high-quality resonator, sharply filtering the noise from the bath.\n3.  **Effective White Noise**: Based on the weak-coupling assumption, the oscillator's dynamics are only sensitive to the noise spectrum in the immediate vicinity of its resonance frequency, $\\omega_0$. This justifies approximating the actual colored noise spectrum $S_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega)$ by a constant value, $S_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega_0)$. A constant power spectrum is the Fourier transform of a time-domain delta function, thus yielding the effective $\\delta$-correlated noise model from which $D_{pp}$ is defined.",
