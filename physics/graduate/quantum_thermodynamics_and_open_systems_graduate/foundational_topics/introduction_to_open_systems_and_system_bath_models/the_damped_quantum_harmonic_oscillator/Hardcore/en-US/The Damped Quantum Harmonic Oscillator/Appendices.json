A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the effective Markovian friction coefficient $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, defined as:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\eta(t) \\, dt\n$$\nThe damping kernel $\\eta(t)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\eta(t) = \\frac{2}{\\pi m} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{J(\\omega)}{\\omega} \\cos(\\omega t) \\, d\\omega\n$$\nThis relationship identifies $\\frac{1}{m}\\frac{J(\\omega)}{\\omega}$ as the Fourier cosine transform spectrum of $\\eta(t)$. Specifically, the Fourier cosine transform of a function $f(t)$ is defined as $\\hat{f}_c(\\omega) = \\int_0^\\infty f(t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\, dt$, and its inverse is $f(t) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty \\hat{f}_c(\\omega) \\cos(\\omega t) \\, d\\omega$.\n\nComparing the given expression for $\\eta(t)$ with the inverse Fourier cosine transform, we can write:\n$$\n\\eta(t) = \\frac{1}{m} \\left( \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{J(\\omega)}{\\omega} \\cos(\\omega t) \\, d\\omega \\right)\n$$\nThis implies that the function $\\frac{J(\\omega)}{\\omega}$ is the Fourier cosine transform of $m \\eta(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{J(\\omega)}{\\omega} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} m \\eta(t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\, dt\n$$\nThe quantity to be computed is $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\eta(t) \\, dt$.

The starting points are the given Heisenberg-Langevin equation and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT).\n\nThe Heisenberg-Langevin equation for the oscillator position operator $x(t)$ is given in the Markovian limit as:\n$$\nm\\,\\ddot{x}(t)+m\\,\\gamma\\,\\dot{x}(t)+m\\,\\omega_{0}^{2}\\,x(t)=\\xi(t)\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass, $\\omega_0$ is the natural frequency, $\\gamma$ is the damping rate, and $\\xi(t)$ is the quantum Langevin force operator originating from the bath.\n\nThe momentum diffusion coefficient $D_{pp}$ is defined through the symmetrized noise correlator in the Markovian approximation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\langle\\left\\{\\xi(t),\\xi(t')\\right\\}\\right\\rangle=2\\,D_{pp}\\,\\delta(t-t')\n$$\nwhere $\\{A,B\\} = AB+BA$ is the anticommutator. This definition implies that the noise is treated as being delta-correlated in time. The Fourier transform of a delta function is a constant, so this corresponds to a flat, or \"white,\" noise spectrum in the frequency domain. Let $S_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega)$ be the power spectrum of the symmetrized noise, defined as the Fourier transform of the time-domain correlator:\n$$\nS_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\, e^{-i\\omega\\tau} \\, \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\langle\\left\\{\\xi(\\tau),\\xi(0)\\right\\}\\right\\rangle\n$$\nApplying the Fourier transform to the definition of $D_{pp}$:\n$$\nS_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\, e^{-i\\omega\\tau} \\, [2\\,D_{pp}\\,\\delta(\\tau)] = 2\\,D_{pp}\n$$\nThis confirms that the diffusion coefficient $D_{pp}$ is, up to a factor of $2$, the constant value of the white noise power spectrum.\n\nHowever, the noise from a physical heat bath is not truly white. The quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) provides the exact, frequency-dependent power spectrum of the noise. For a system with a linear coupling to a bath, whose dissipative influence is characterized by a friction kernel $\\gamma(t)$, the FDT relates the symmetrized noise spectrum $S_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega)$ to the real part of the Fourier-transformed friction kernel, $\\text{Re}[\\tilde{\\gamma}(\\omega)]$. The standard form of the FDT is:\n$$\nS_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega) = m \\, \\text{Re}[\\tilde{\\gamma}(\\omega)] \\, \\hbar\\omega \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature of the bath.\n\nIn the problem statement, we are given an Ohmic spectral density $J(\\omega) = m\\gamma\\omega$. The real part of the friction kernel is related to the spectral density by $\\text{Re}[\\tilde{\\gamma}(\\omega)] = \\frac{J(\\omega)}{m\\omega}$. Substituting the given form of $J(\\omega)$, we find:\n$$\n\\text{Re}[\\tilde{\\gamma}(\\omega)] = \\frac{m\\gamma\\omega}{m\\omega} = \\gamma\n$$\nThis demonstrates that for a strictly Ohmic bath, the dissipative part of the friction is frequency-independent and equal to the phenomenological friction rate $\\gamma$, which is consistent with the provided Markovian Langevin equation.\n\nSubstituting $\\text{Re}[\\tilde{\\gamma}(\\omega)] = \\gamma$ into the FDT expression, we obtain the colored noise spectrum for the Langevin force:\n$$\nS_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega) = m\\gamma\\hbar\\omega \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThis spectrum is not constant; it depends on frequency $\\omega$. To reconcile this with the white-noise definition of $D_{pp}$, we must invoke a physical approximation. The Langevin equation describes a harmonic oscillator, which is a resonant system. If the oscillator is weakly damped, meaning its quality factor $Q = \\omega_0/\\gamma \\gg 1$, it responds predominantly to driving forces with frequencies in a narrow band around its resonance frequency $\\omega_0$. Therefore, the evolution of the oscillator is primarily sensitive to the noise power spectral density at $\\omega \\approx \\omega_0$.\n\nUnder this weak-coupling (or high-Q) assumption, it is a standard and well-justified procedure to approximate the colored noise spectrum by its value at the oscillator's natural frequency. This is the essence of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) often used in deriving the master equation for such systems. We replace the full spectrum $S_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega)$ with an effective flat spectrum:\n$$\nS_{\\text{eff}} = S_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega_0) = m\\gamma\\hbar\\omega_0 \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nBy equating this effective white noise spectrum with $2D_{pp}$, we can determine the diffusion coefficient:\n$$\n2D_{pp} = m\\gamma\\hbar\\omega_0 \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $D_{pp}$ yields the final expression:\n$$\nD_{pp} = \\frac{m\\gamma\\hbar\\omega_0}{2} \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThis result correctly captures the quantum nature of the fluctuations. In the high-temperature limit where $k_B T \\gg \\hbar\\omega_0$, we can use the approximation $\\coth(x) \\approx 1/x$, which gives $\\coth(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0}{2k_B T}) \\approx \\frac{2k_B T}{\\hbar\\omega_0}$. The expression for $D_{pp}$ then reduces to the classical result $D_{pp} \\approx m\\gamma k_B T$. In the zero-temperature limit ($T \\to 0$), $\\coth(x) \\to 1$ for $x0$, yielding $D_{pp} = \\frac{m\\gamma\\hbar\\omega_0}{2}$, which represents diffusion driven purely by quantum vacuum fluctuations of the bath.\n\nThe assumptions required to arrive at a $\\delta$-correlated symmetrized noise are as follows:\n1.  **Markovian Approximation**: The bath correlation time is assumed to be infinitesimally short compared to the characteristic timescales of the oscillator's dynamics ($1/\\omega_0$ and $1/\\gamma$). This is what allows for a time-local description of damping.\n2.  **Weak-Coupling Approximation**: The damping rate is assumed to be much smaller than the oscillator's frequency ($\\gamma \\ll \\omega_0$). This makes the oscillator a high-quality resonator, sharply filtering the noise from the bath.\n3.  **Effective White Noise**: Based on the weak-coupling assumption, the oscillator's dynamics are only sensitive to the noise spectrum in the immediate vicinity of its resonance frequency, $\\omega_0$. This justifies approximating the actual colored noise spectrum $S_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega)$ by a constant value, $S_{\\xi\\xi}(\\omega_0)$. A constant power spectrum is the Fourier transform of a time-domain delta function, thus yielding the effective $\\delta$-correlated noise model from which $D_{pp}$ is defined.",

It outlines a standard derivation in quantum statistical mechanics.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in four steps as requested: obtaining the susceptibility, applying the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT), evaluating the resulting integral under the weak-damping approximation, and comparing with the canonical ensemble result.\n\nFirst, we determine the retarded susceptibility $\\chi(\\omega)$ from the given equation of motion for the expectation value of the position operator, $\\langle x(t) \\rangle$:\n$$m \\frac{d^2\\langle x(t) \\rangle}{dt^2} + m \\gamma \\frac{d\\langle x(t) \\rangle}{dt} + m \\omega_0^2 \\langle x(t) \\rangle = F(t)$$\nWe define the Fourier transform as $f(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{i\\omega t} dt$.

By direct comparison, we identify:\n$$\\chi(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{m(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - i\\omega\\gamma)}$$\nThe imaginary part of the susceptibility, often called the dissipative part, is:\n$$\\chi''(\\omega) \\equiv \\text{Im}[\\chi(\\omega)] = \\text{Im}\\left[\\frac{1}{m(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - i\\omega\\gamma)} \\cdot \\frac{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + i\\omega\\gamma)}{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + i\\omega\\gamma)}\\right] = \\frac{\\omega\\gamma}{m\\left[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\omega^2\\gamma^2\\right]}$$\nSecond, we use the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT). The FDT relates the equilibrium fluctuations of a system to its linear response to an external perturbation. For the position operator $x$, the Fourier transform of the symmetrized correlation function, $S_{xx}(\\omega) = \\int dt e^{i\\omega t} \\frac{1}{2}\\langle \\hat{x}(t)\\hat{x}(0) + \\hat{x}(0)\\hat{x}(t) \\rangle$, is related to $\\chi''(\\omega)$ by:\n$$S_{xx}(\\omega) = \\hbar \\chi''(\\omega) \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega\\beta}{2}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The equilibrium position variance $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ is the value of the correlation function at time $t=0$, which can be obtained by integrating the spectral density $S_{xx}(\\omega)$ over all frequencies:\n$$\\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\langle x(0)^2 \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} S_{xx}(\\omega)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S_{xx}(\\omega)$ and $\\chi''(\\omega)$ yields the integral representation for the variance:\n$$\\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\hbar \\left(\\frac{\\omega\\gamma}{m\\left[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\omega^2\\gamma^2\\right]}\\right) \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega\\beta}{2}\\right)$$\nThe integrand is an even function of $\\omega$, so we can rewrite the integral over the positive frequency axis:\n$$\\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar\\gamma}{\\pi m} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\omega \\frac{\\omega}{\\left[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\omega^2\\gamma^2\\right]} \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega\\beta}{2}\\right)$$\nThird, we evaluate this integral in the weak-damping limit, $\\gamma/\\omega_0 \\ll 1$. In this limit, the function $L(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega\\gamma}{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\omega^2\\gamma^2}$ is a sharply peaked Lorentzian-like function centered near $\\omega = \\omega_0$. The width of this peak is of order $\\gamma$. Since $\\gamma$ is small, we can approximate the slowly varying part of the integrand, $\\coth(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega\\beta}{2})$, by its value at the peak, $\\omega = \\omega_0$. We thus pull it out of the integral:\n$$\\langle x^2 \\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\pi m} \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0\\beta}{2}\\right) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\omega \\frac{\\omega\\gamma}{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\omega^2\\gamma^2}$$\nNow we evaluate the remaining integral. For $\\gamma \\ll \\omega_0$, the main contribution comes from $\\omega \\approx \\omega_0$. We can use the approximations: $\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 = (\\omega_0 - \\omega)(\\omega_0 + \\omega) \\approx 2\\omega_0(\\omega_0 - \\omega)$, and in the less sensitive terms, we set $\\omega \\approx \\omega_0$. The integral becomes:\n$$I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\omega \\frac{\\omega\\gamma}{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\omega^2\\gamma^2} \\approx \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\omega \\frac{\\omega_0\\gamma}{(2\\omega_0(\\omega_0 - \\omega))^2 + \\omega_0^2\\gamma^2} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\omega \\frac{\\omega_0\\gamma}{4\\omega_0^2(\\omega_0 - \\omega)^2 + \\omega_0^2\\gamma^2}$$\n$$I = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega_0} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{d\\omega}{4(\\omega - \\omega_0)^2 + \\gamma^2}$$\nSince the integrand is sharply peaked at $\\omega_0  0$, we can extend the lower limit of integration to $-\\infty$ with negligible error.

The Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_0^2\\hat{x}^2$. In terms of creation ($\\hat{a}^\\dagger$) and annihilation ($\\hat{a}$) operators, $\\hat{x} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega_0}}(\\hat{a} + \\hat{a}^\\dagger)$.

In a thermal state (number basis), $\\langle \\hat{a}^2 \\rangle = \\langle (\\hat{a}^\\dagger)^2 \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle \\hat{a}\\hat{a}^\\dagger + \\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a} \\rangle = \\langle 2\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a} + 1 \\rangle = 2\\langle \\hat{n} \\rangle + 1$. The mean occupation number $\\langle \\hat{n} \\rangle$ is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution, $\\langle \\hat{n} \\rangle = (\\exp(\\hbar\\omega_0\\beta) - 1)^{-1}$.\nTherefore,\n$$\\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega_0}(2\\langle \\hat{n} \\rangle + 1) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega_0}\\left(\\frac{2}{e^{\\hbar\\omega_0\\beta} - 1} + 1\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega_0}\\left(\\frac{e^{\\hbar\\omega_0\\beta} + 1}{e^{\\hbar\\omega_0\\beta} - 1}\\right)$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega_0}\\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0\\beta}{2}\\right)$$\nThe result from the FDT in the weak-damping limit is identical to the exact result for an undamped oscillator in thermal equilibrium. This is expected, as weak coupling to a thermal bath should drive the system to the canonical Gibbs state corresponding to the system's own Hamiltonian.\n\nThe final closed-form expression for the equilibrium position variance in the weak-damping limit is therefore given by this expression.",
