Assume the canonical equilibrium distribution applies, and define the equilibrium Shannon entropy $H$ (in natural units, measured in \"nats\") by $H=-\\sum_{i}p_{i}\\ln p_{i}$, where $p_{i}$ are the equilibrium probabilities of the two energy levels. A logically irreversible reset-to-zero operation on this memory erases the information in the initial equilibrium distribution by mapping both states to the single reference state at energy $0$.

The system is in canonical equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature $T$. The Boltzmann constant is $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the equilibrium probabilities of the two states, $p_0$ and $p_1$, using the canonical ensemble framework.

It represents a standard problem in quantum thermodynamics concerning the physical limits of computation.\n\nThe objective is to derive the minimal average heat $Q_{\\min}(T,\\epsilon)$ transferred to a thermal reservoir to perform a reset operation on a two-level quantum memory. The derivation will be based exclusively on the provided fundamental principles.\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics for the composite system (memory and reservoir) states that the total entropy change is non-negative:\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text{tot}} = \\Delta S_{\\text{sys}} + \\Delta S_{\\text{env}} \\geq 0\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta S_{\\text{sys}}$ is the entropy change of the memory, and $\\Delta S_{\\text{env}}$ is the entropy change of the environment (reservoir).\n\nThe problem specifies that the process is \"thermodynamically reversible in the limit of minimal dissipation\".

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimal average heat dumped into a thermal reservoir during the erasure of a bit in a two-state quantum memory. The derivation must be from first principles, under the specified conditions of equal average energies for the logical states but different equilibrium entropies.\n\nWe begin by applying the fundamental laws of thermodynamics to the process. The system is the two-state memory, and it is in contact with a thermal reservoir at a constant temperature $T$.\n\nFirst, we characterize the initial state of the system. The memory is in a probabilistic mixture of its two logical states, $k=0$ and $k=1$, with equal probabilities $p_{0} = p_{1} = 1/2$. Within each logical subspace, the system is in a canonical Gibbs state.\n\nThe average energy of the initial state, $\\langle U_{\\text{sys}} \\rangle_{\\text{i}}$, is the probabilistic average of the energies of the two logical states:\n$$\n\\langle U_{\\text{sys}} \\rangle_{\\text{i}} = p_{0} U_{0} + p_{1} U_{1}\n$$\nGiven that $p_{0} = p_{1} = 1/2$ and $U_{0} = U_{1} = U$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\langle U_{\\text{sys}} \\rangle_{\\text{i}} = \\frac{1}{2} U + \\frac{1}{2} U = U\n$$\n\nThe total thermodynamic entropy of the initial state, $S_{\\text{sys, i}}$, is given by the sum of the average equilibrium entropy and the mixing (Shannon) entropy of the logical probability distribution.\nThe average equilibrium entropy is:\n$$\n\\langle S_{\\text{eq}} \\rangle_{\\text{i}} = p_{0} S_{0} + p_{1} S_{1} = \\frac{1}{2} S_{0} + \\frac{1}{2} S_{1} = \\frac{S_{0} + S_{1}}{2}\n$$\nThe mixing entropy associated with the logical states is:\n$$\nS_{\\text{mixing, i}} = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\sum_{k=0,1} p_{k} \\ln(p_{k}) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln(2)\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\nTherefore, the total initial entropy of the system is:\n$$\nS_{\\text{sys, i}} = \\langle S_{\\text{eq}} \\rangle_{\\text{i}} + S_{\\text{mixing, i}} = \\frac{S_{0} + S_{1}}{2} + k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln(2)\n$$\n\nNext, we characterize the final state of the system. The erasure protocol resets the memory to the logical state $0$ with unit probability. Thus, the final logical probabilities are $p'_{0} = 1$ and $p'_{1} = 0$. The system is in the corresponding equilibrium state for the logical subspace $0$.\n\nThe average energy of the final state, $\\langle U_{\\text{sys}} \\rangle_{\\text{f}}$, is simply the energy of logical state $0$:\n$$\n\\langle U_{\\text{sys}} \\rangle_{\\text{f}} = U_{0} = U\n$$\nThe total entropy of the final state, $S_{\\text{sys, f}}$, has no mixing component, as the logical state is certain ($p'_{0} = 1$). It is therefore equal to the equilibrium entropy of the logical state $0$:\n$$\nS_{\\text{sys, f}} = S_{0}\n$$\n\nNow, we analyze the thermodynamic changes during the process. The change in the system's average energy is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\langle U_{\\text{sys}} \\rangle = \\langle U_{\\text{sys}} \\rangle_{\\text{f}} - \\langle U_{\\text{sys}} \\rangle_{\\text{i}} = U - U = 0\n$$\nThe change in the system's entropy is:\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text{sys}} = S_{\\text{sys, f}} - S_{\\text{sys, i}} = S_{0} - \\left( \\frac{S_{0} + S_{1}}{2} + k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln(2) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text{sys}} = \\frac{2S_{0} - S_{0} - S_{1}}{2} - k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln(2) = \\frac{S_{0} - S_{1}}{2} - k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln(2)\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal average heat dumped into the reservoir, $\\langle Q_{\\mathrm{bath}} \\rangle_{\\min}$. The process is stated to be thermodynamically reversible (quasi-static and isothermal, with no excess entropy production). According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, for any process, the change in the total entropy of the universe (system + reservoir) must be non-negative: $\\Delta S_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta S_{\\text{sys}} + \\Delta S_{\\text{bath}} \\ge 0$. For a reversible process, this change is zero:\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text{total, min}} = \\Delta S_{\\text{sys}} + \\Delta S_{\\text{bath}} = 0\n$$\nThe change in the entropy of the reservoir, which is at a constant temperature $T$, is related to the heat it absorbs, $\\langle Q_{\\mathrm{bath}} \\rangle$, by the Clausius relation: $\\Delta S_{\\text{bath}} = \\frac{\\langle Q_{\\mathrm{bath}} \\rangle}{T}$.\nFor the minimal heat dissipation corresponding to the reversible process, we have:\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text{sys}} + \\frac{\\langle Q_{\\mathrm{bath}} \\rangle_{\\min}}{T} = 0\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the minimal heat dumped to the bath as:\n$$\n\\langle Q_{\\mathrm{bath}} \\rangle_{\\min} = -T \\Delta S_{\\text{sys}}\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\Delta S_{\\text{sys}}$:\n$$\n\\langle Q_{\\mathrm{bath}} \\rangle_{\\min} = -T \\left( \\frac{S_{0} - S_{1}}{2} - k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln(2) \\right) = T \\left( k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln(2) - \\frac{S_{0} - S_{1}}{2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\langle Q_{\\mathrm{bath}} \\rangle_{\\min} = k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\ln(2) - T\\frac{S_{0} - S_{1}}{2}\n$$\n\nThe final step is to express this result in terms of the free-energy bias, $\\Delta F$. The problem defines $\\Delta F$ as:\n$$\n\\Delta F := \\frac{F_{1} - F_{0}}{2}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the Helmholtz free energy for each logical state, $F_{k} = U_{k} - T S_{k}$, and the given condition $U_{0} = U_{1} = U$, we find:\n$$\nF_{1} - F_{0} = (U - T S_{1}) - (U - T S_{0}) = T S_{0} - T S_{1} = T(S_{0} - S_{1})\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $\\Delta F$:\n$$\n\\Delta F = \\frac{T(S_{0} - S_{1})}{2}\n$$\nWe can now see that the second term in our expression for $\\langle Q_{\\mathrm{bath}} \\rangle_{\\min}$ is precisely $\\Delta F$:\n$$\nT\\frac{S_{0} - S_{1}}{2} = \\Delta F\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for the minimal heat gives the final expression:\n$$\n\\langle Q_{\\mathrm{bath}} \\rangle_{\\min} = k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\ln(2) - \\Delta F\n$$\nThis result explicitly shows how the bias $\\Delta F$ modifies the standard Landauer limit of $k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\ln(2)$. The Landauer limit corresponds to the case where the logical states are physically symmetric, implying $S_{0} = S_{1}$ and thus $\\Delta F = 0$. If $\\Delta F > 0$, which means $F_0 < F_1$ (the reset state $0$ is energetically favorable), the minimum required heat dissipation is reduced. This is because the system has a natural tendency to occupy the state with lower free energy, and the erasure process is assisted by this asymmetry. Conversely, if $\\Delta F < 0$, the reset state is unfavorable, and an additional energetic cost, equal to $|\\Delta F|$, must be paid, leading to a heat dissipation greater than the standard Landauer limit.",
