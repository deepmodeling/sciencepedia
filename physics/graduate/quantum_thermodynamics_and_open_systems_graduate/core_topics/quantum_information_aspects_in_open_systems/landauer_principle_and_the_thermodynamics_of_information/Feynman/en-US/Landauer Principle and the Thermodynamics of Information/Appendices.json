The Boltzmann constant is $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$. Assume the canonical equilibrium distribution applies, and define the equilibrium Shannon entropy $H$ (in natural units, measured in \"nats\") by $H=-\\sum_{i}p_{i}\\ln p_{i}$, where $p_{i}$ are the equilibrium probabilities of the two energy levels. A logically irreversible reset-to-zero operation on this memory erases the information in the initial equilibrium distribution by mapping both states to the single reference state at energy $0$. According to Landauer's principle, the minimal average heat $Q_{\\min}$ dissipated into the reservoir in such an erasure is proportional to the amount of information erased, with the proportionality factor set by the reservoir temperature.\n\nStarting from the definitions above and the canonical equilibrium framework, derive the closed-form analytic expression for the equilibrium Shannon entropy $H$ of this two-state system and then use Landauer’s principle to obtain an explicit expression for the minimal erasure heat $Q_{\\min}(T,\\Delta)$ in terms of $\\Delta$, $T$, and $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$.

It represents a standard problem in quantum thermodynamics concerning the physical limits of computation.\n\nThe objective is to derive the minimal average heat $Q_{\\min}(T,\\epsilon)$ transferred to a thermal reservoir to perform a reset operation on a two-level quantum memory. The derivation will be based exclusively on the provided fundamental principles.\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics for the composite system (memory and reservoir) states that the total entropy change is non-negative:\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text{tot}} = \\Delta S_{\\text{sys}} + \\Delta S_{\\text{env}} \\ge 0\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta S_{\\text{sys}}$ is the entropy change of the memory, and $\\Delta S_{\\text{env}}$ is the entropy change of the environment (reservoir).\n\nThe problem specifies that the process is \"thermodynamically reversible in the limit of minimal dissipation\".

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Irreversible Entropy Production Functional\nWe begin by expressing the irreversible entropy production rate $\\sigma(t)$ in terms of the probability path $p(t)$. The rate is defined as $\\sigma(t) = \\dot{S}_{\\mathrm{sys}}(t) + \\beta \\dot{Q}(t)$.\n\nFirst, we find the time derivative of the system entropy, $\\dot{S}_{\\mathrm{sys}}(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{S}_{\\mathrm{sys}}(t) = \\frac{d S_{\\mathrm{sys}}}{dp} \\dot{p}(t) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\frac{d}{dp}\\left[p \\ln p + (1-p)\\ln(1-p)\\right] \\dot{p}(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d S_{\\mathrm{sys}}}{dp} = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\left[ (\\ln p + 1) - (\\ln(1-p) + 1) \\right] = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p}{p}\\right)\n$$\nThus, $\\dot{S}_{\\mathrm{sys}}(t) = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p(t)}{p(t)}\\right) \\dot{p}(t)$.\n\nNext, we determine the heat flow rate $\\dot{Q}(t)$. According to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in internal energy $d U$ is the sum of heat absorbed $dQ$ and work done on the system $dW$. Here, $U(t) = \\varepsilon(t)p(t)$. The work is done by changing the energy level $\\varepsilon(t)$, so $dW = p(t) d\\varepsilon$. Thus, $d Q = dU - dW = d(\\varepsilon p) - p d\\varepsilon = (\\varepsilon dp + p d\\varepsilon) - p d\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon dp$. The heat flow rate is therefore $\\dot{Q}(t) = \\varepsilon(t) \\dot{p}(t)$.\n\nSubstituting $\\dot{S}_{\\mathrm{sys}}(t)$ and $\\dot{Q}(t)$ into the expression for $\\sigma(t)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p(t)}{p(t)}\\right) \\dot{p}(t) + \\beta \\varepsilon(t) \\dot{p}(t) = \\left[ k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p(t)}{p(t)}\\right) + \\beta \\varepsilon(t) \\right] \\dot{p}(t)\n$$\nTo eliminate the control parameter $\\varepsilon(t)$, we use the provided definitions. From $p^{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\varepsilon) = (1+\\exp(\\beta \\varepsilon))^{-1}$, we can solve for $\\beta \\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\exp(\\beta \\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{p^{\\mathrm{eq}}} - 1 = \\frac{1-p^{\\mathrm{eq}}}{p^{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\implies \\beta \\varepsilon(t) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p^{\\mathrm{eq}}(t)}{p^{\\mathrm{eq}}(t)}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\sigma(t)$ yields:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\left[ k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p(t)}{p(t)}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p^{\\mathrm{eq}}(t)}{p^{\\mathrm{eq}}(t)}\\right) \\right] \\dot{p}(t) = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p(t)}{p(t)}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{p^{\\mathrm{eq}}(t)}{1-p^{\\mathrm{eq}}(t)}\\right) \\right] \\dot{p}(t)\n$$\nThe exact expression for $\\sigma(t)$ is $\\sigma(t) = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p}{p} \\frac{p^{\\mathrm{eq}}}{1-p^{\\mathrm{eq}}}\\right)\\dot{p}$.\n\nNow we invoke the slow-driving, near-equilibrium condition, $|p(t) - p^{\\mathrm{eq}}(t)| \\ll 1$. Let $X(p) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p}{p}\\right)$. We Taylor expand $X(p)$ around $p^{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$\nX(p) \\approx X(p^{\\mathrm{eq}}) + X'(p^{\\mathrm{eq}})(p-p^{\\mathrm{eq}})\n$$\nThe derivative is $X'(p^{\\mathrm{eq}}) = -\\frac{1}{p^{\\mathrm{eq}}(1-p^{\\mathrm{eq}})}$.\nTherefore, $X(p) - X(p^{\\mathrm{eq}}) \\approx -\\frac{1}{p^{\\mathrm{eq}}(1-p^{\\mathrm{eq}})}(p-p^{\\mathrm{eq}})$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\sigma(t)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) \\approx k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{p^{\\mathrm{eq}}(1-p^{\\mathrm{eq}})}(p-p^{\\mathrm{eq}}) \\right] \\dot{p}(t)\n$$\nSince $p \\approx p^{\\mathrm{eq}}$, we can replace the denominator with $p(1-p)$.\n$$\n\\sigma(t) \\approx -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\frac{p-p^{\\mathrm{eq}}}{p(1-p)}\\dot{p}\n$$\nFrom the system dynamics, we have $p-p^{\\mathrm{eq}} = -\\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\dot{p}$. Substituting this gives the leading-order expression for the entropy production rate:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) \\approx -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\frac{-\\dot{p}/\\kappa}{p(1-p)}\\dot{p} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\kappa} \\frac{\\dot{p}(t)^2}{p(t)(1-p(t))}\n$$\nThis is positive definite, as required.\n\nThe total irreversible entropy production is the time integral of this rate:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{i}} S[p(t)] = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\sigma(t) dt = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\kappa} \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\frac{\\dot{p}(t)^2}{p(t)(1-p(t))} dt\n$$\n\n### Variational Problem and Optimal Path\nTo minimize $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{i}} S$, we must find the path $p(t)$ that minimizes the functional above, subject to $p(0) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $p(\\tau) = \\delta$.\nThe integrand has the form of a kinetic energy term in a curved space. Let's define an intrinsic coordinate $x$ such that the cost functional becomes quadratic in $\\dot{x}$. The form of the integrand suggests defining $x$ such that $dx = \\frac{dp}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}$.\nIntegrating this expression:\n$$\nx(p) = \\int \\frac{dp}{\\sqrt{p-p^2}} = \\int \\frac{dp}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} - (p-\\frac{1}{2})^2}} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{p-\\frac{1}{2}}{1/2}\\right) = \\arcsin(2p-1)\n$$\nWith this change of variable, we have $\\dot{x} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\arcsin(2p-1) = \\frac{2\\dot{p}}{\\sqrt{1-(2p-1)^2}} = \\frac{2\\dot{p}}{\\sqrt{4p-4p^2}} = \\frac{\\dot{p}}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}$.\nThe integrand becomes $\\frac{\\dot{p}^2}{p(1-p)} = \\dot{x}^2$. The functional is transformed into:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{i}} S[x(t)] = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\kappa} \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\dot{x}(t)^2 dt\n$$\nThe boundary conditions on $p(t)$ transform into boundary conditions on $x(t)$:\n- At $t=0$: $p(0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies x(0) = \\arcsin(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} - 1) = \\arcsin(0) = 0$.\n- At $t=\\tau$: $p(\\tau) = \\delta \\implies x(\\tau) = \\arcsin(2\\delta - 1)$.\n\nWe now minimize $\\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\dot{x}^2 dt$ using the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Lagrangian $L(x, \\dot{x}) = \\dot{x}^2$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} - \\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} = 0 \\implies 0 - \\frac{d}{dt}(2\\dot{x}) = 0 \\implies \\ddot{x}(t) = 0\n$$\nThe solution is a path with constant velocity in $x$-space: $x(t) = At + B$.\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n- $x(0) = B = 0$.\n- $x(\\tau) = A\\tau = \\arcsin(2\\delta-1) \\implies A = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\arcsin(2\\delta-1)$.\nThe optimal path for the intrinsic coordinate is $x^{\\star}(t) = \\frac{t}{\\tau}\\arcsin(2\\delta-1)$. This corresponds to moving at a constant speed in the geometry defined by the thermodynamic metric. The optimal schedule for the probability is found by inverting the transformation:\n$$\np^{\\star}(t) = \\frac{1 + \\sin(x^{\\star}(t))}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[1 + \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\arcsin(2\\delta-1)\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\n### Minimal Irreversible Entropy Production\nWe substitute the optimal velocity $\\dot{x}^{\\star}(t) = A = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\arcsin(2\\delta-1)$ back into the functional for $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{i}} S$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{i}} S_{\\min} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\kappa} \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\arcsin(2\\delta-1)\\right)^2 dt = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\kappa \\tau^2} \\left[\\arcsin(2\\delta-1)\\right]^2 \\int_{0}^{\\tau} dt\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{i}} S_{\\min} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\kappa \\tau} \\left[\\arcsin(2\\delta-1)\\right]^2\n$$\nSince $0 < \\delta < \\frac{1}{2}$, $2\\delta-1$ is in $(-1, 0)$, so $\\arcsin(2\\delta-1)$ is well-defined and negative. Its square is positive, as required for entropy production.\n\n### Optimal Control Protocol and Comparison with Quasistatic Limit\nThe optimal control protocol $\\varepsilon^{\\star}(t)$ is determined by the requirement that it steers the system along the optimal path $p^{\\star}(t)$. From the near-equilibrium relations:\n$$\n\\beta \\varepsilon^{\\star}(t) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p^{\\mathrm{eq, \\star}}(t)}{p^{\\mathrm{eq, \\star}}(t)}\\right) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad p^{\\mathrm{eq, \\star}}(t) = p^{\\star}(t) + \\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\dot{p}^{\\star}(t)\n$$\nThis provides an explicit expression for the control $\\varepsilon^{\\star}(t)$ in terms of the optimal schedule $p^{\\star}(t)$ and its derivative.\n\nThe total heat absorbed by the system is $Q = T_{\\mathrm{bath}}(\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{sys}} - \\Delta_{\\mathrm{i}} S)$. The minimal heat absorbed is $Q_{\\min}(\\tau) = T_{\\mathrm{bath}}(\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{sys}} - \\Delta_{\\mathrm{i}} S_{\\min})$.\nThe change in system entropy is $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{sys}} = S_{\\mathrm{sys}}(p(\\tau)) - S_{\\mathrm{sys}}(p(0))$:\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{sys}} = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}[\\delta\\ln\\delta + (1-\\delta)\\ln(1-\\delta)] - \\left(-k_{\\mathrm{B}}[\\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln\\tfrac{1}{2} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln\\tfrac{1}{2}]\\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}[\\delta\\ln\\delta + (1-\\delta)\\ln(1-\\delta) + \\ln 2]\n$$\nThe reversibly exchanged heat (quasistatic limit, $\\tau \\to \\infty$) is $Q_{\\mathrm{rev}} = T_{\\mathrm{bath}}\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{sys}}$. The heat dissipated to the bath is $-Q_{\\mathrm{rev}} = -T_{\\mathrm{bath}}\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{sys}}$, which is a generalized Landauer bound for partial erasure from a mixed state to one with error $\\delta$.\nFor the finite-time process, the minimal heat absorbed is:\n$$\nQ_{\\min}(\\tau) = Q_{\\mathrm{rev}} - T_{\\mathrm{bath}} \\Delta_{\\mathrm{i}} S_{\\min}\n$$\nThe additional heat dissipated due to the finite duration of the process is $T_{\\mathrm{bath}} \\Delta_{\\mathrm{i}} S_{\\min} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T_{\\mathrm{bath}}}{\\kappa \\tau}[\\arcsin(2\\delta-1)]^2$. This irreversible contribution vanishes as $\\tau \\to \\infty$, recovering the quasistatic, reversible limit. The $1/\\tau$ scaling is a characteristic feature of slow, near-equilibrium transformations. The minimal total heat dissipated to the bath is $-Q_{\\min}(\\tau) = -Q_{\\mathrm{rev}} + T_{\\mathrm{bath}}\\Delta_{\\mathrm{i}} S_{\\min}$, which is always greater than the reversible bound for finite $\\tau$.",
