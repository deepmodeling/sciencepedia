            "problem": "Consider a two-level quantum system with Hamiltonian $H=\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2}\\sigma_{z}$ interacting weakly with a bosonic thermal environment at inverse temperature $\\beta$. The interaction Hamiltonian is $H_{\\mathrm{I}}=\\lambda\\,\\sigma_{x}\\otimes B$, where $\\lambda$ is a small coupling constant, $\\sigma_{x}=\\sigma_{+}+\\sigma_{-}$ is the system coupling operator in terms of the ladder operators $\\sigma_{\\pm}$, and $B$ is a linear bath operator composed of harmonic modes. Assume the Born-Markov approximation and the secular approximation apply, and that the environment is initially in the Gibbs state at inverse temperature $\\beta$ with respect to its free Hamiltonian. The reduced dynamics of the system is then a quantum dynamical semigroup generated by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generator, whose dissipative rates are determined by the environment’s equilibrium correlation functions via the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition.\n\nStarting from the definitions of Bohr frequencies and eigenoperators of $H$, and from the equilibrium bath correlation function and its Fourier transform, construct the GKSL generator for the system by identifying the jump operators and their associated transition rates.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it represents a standard, well-posed problem in the theory of open quantum systems, specifically the derivation of the Lindblad master equation for a spin-boson model. All provided information is scientifically grounded, self-consistent, and sufficient for deriving a unique solution.\n\nThe system in question is a two-level quantum system (a qubit) whose free dynamics are governed by the Hamiltonian $H=\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2}\\sigma_{z}$. The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are the excited state $|e\\rangle$ and the ground state $|g\\rangle$, corresponding to the eigenvalues $+1$ and $-1$ of the Pauli operator $\\sigma_z$, respectively. The energy eigenvalues are thus $E_e = +\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}$ and $E_g = -\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}$. The energy difference between these levels defines the system's characteristic Bohr frequency, $\\Delta E = E_e - E_g = \\omega_0$. For a transition to occur, the system must either absorb or emit energy equal to $\\omega_0$.\n\nThe system interacts with a thermal environment via the interaction Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{I}}=\\lambda\\,\\sigma_{x}\\otimes B$. The system part of this interaction is $\\sigma_x$. To analyze the dissipative dynamics under the secular approximation, we must decompose the system operator $\\sigma_x$ into the eigenoperators of the free Hamiltonian's adjoint action, i.e., operators $A$ satisfying $[H, A] = -\\omega A$ for some Bohr frequency $\\omega$. The operator $\\sigma_x$ can be written in terms of the ladder operators $\\sigma_+ = |e\\rangle\\langle g|$ and $\\sigma_- = |g\\rangle\\langle e|$ as $\\sigma_x = \\sigma_+ + \\sigma_-$.\nLet's find the Bohr frequencies associated with these ladder operators.\nFor $\\sigma_-$, we have:\n$$[H, \\sigma_-] = \\left[\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}\\sigma_z, |g\\rangle\\langle e|\\right] = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2} (\\sigma_z |g\\rangle\\langle e| - |g\\rangle\\langle e| \\sigma_z) = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2}(-1 \\cdot |g\\rangle\\langle e| - |g\\rangle\\langle e| \\cdot 1) = -\\omega_0 |g\\rangle\\langle e| = -\\omega_0 \\sigma_-$$\nThis means $\\sigma_-$ is an eigenoperator with Bohr frequency $\\omega = \\omega_0$. This operator induces a downward transition from $|e\\rangle$ to $|g\\rangle$, corresponding to the system losing energy $\\omega_0$.\n\nFor $\\sigma_+$, we have:\n$$[H, \\sigma_+] = \\left[\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}\\sigma_z, |e\\rangle\\langle g|\\right] = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2} (\\sigma_z |e\\rangle\\langle g| - |e\\rangle\\langle g| \\sigma_z) = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2}(1 \\cdot |e\\rangle\\langle g| - |e\\rangle\\langle g| \\cdot (-1)) = \\omega_0 |e\\rangle\\langle g| = \\omega_0 \\sigma_+$$\nThis means $\\sigma_+$ is an eigenoperator with Bohr frequency $\\omega = -\\omega_0$. This operator induces an upward transition from $|g\\rangle$ to $|e\\rangle$, corresponding to the system gaining energy $\\omega_0$.\n\nThe dynamics of the system's reduced density matrix $\\rho_S$, under the Born, Markov, and secular approximations, is described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation. For this system, it takes the form:\n$$\\frac{d\\rho_S}{dt} = -i[H, \\rho_S] + \\mathcal{D}(\\rho_S)$$\nThe dissipative part, or Lindbladian $\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_S)$, is a sum over the contributions from each jump process:\n$$\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_S) = G(\\omega_0) \\left( \\sigma_- \\rho_S \\sigma_+ - \\frac{1}{2}\\{\\sigma_+ \\sigma_-, \\rho_S\\} \\right) + G(-\\omega_0) \\left( \\sigma_+ \\rho_S \\sigma_- - \\frac{1}{2}\\{\\sigma_- \\sigma_+, \\rho_S\\} \\right)$$\nHere, the operators $\\sigma_-$ and $\\sigma_+$ are the jump operators. The rate $G(\\omega_0)$ corresponds to the downward transition (decay rate), and $G(-\\omega_0)$ corresponds to the upward transition (excitation rate). These rates are determined by the Fourier transform of the bath correlation function, evaluated at the corresponding Bohr frequency:\n$$G(\\omega) = \\lambda^2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\, e^{i\\omega\\tau} \\langle B(\\tau) B(0) \\rangle_{\\beta}$$\nwhere $B(\\tau) = e^{iH_B \\tau} B e^{-iH_B \\tau}$ is the bath operator in the interaction picture with respect to the bath Hamiltonian $H_B$, and the expectation value $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle_{\\beta}$ is taken over the thermal Gibbs state of the bath $\\rho_B = \\exp(-\\beta H_B) / \\mathrm{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta H_B)]$.\n\nThe problem states that the environment is a bosonic bath characterized by a spectral density $J(\\omega)$ and the Bose-Einstein distribution $n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega)=\\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega)-1}$. The spectral density $J(\\omega)$ is conventionally defined for $\\omega > 0$ and encapsulates the coupling strength $\\lambda^2$ and the density of bath modes at frequency $\\omega$. The rates $G(\\omega_0)$ and $G(-\\omega_0)$ can be expressed in terms of $J(\\omega_0)$ and $n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega_0)$ through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.\n\nThe downward rate $G(\\omega_0)$ corresponds to the system losing energy $\\omega_0$ to the bath (emission). This process can be spontaneous or stimulated by the thermal excitations already present in the bath. The rate is therefore proportional to $J(\\omega_0)$ and the factor $(n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega_0) + 1)$:\n$$G(\\omega_0) = J(\\omega_0) (n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega_0) + 1)$$\n\nThe upward rate $G(-\\omega_0)$ corresponds to the system gaining energy $\\omega_0$ from the bath (absorption). This process can only occur if the bath has thermal excitations to provide the energy. The rate is therefore proportional to $J(\\omega_0)$ and the number of thermal bosons $n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega_0)$:\n$$G(-\\omega_0) = J(\\omega_0) n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega_0)$$\n\nNow we express these rates solely in terms of $J(\\omega_0)$ and $\\beta$ by substituting the definition of $n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega_0)$:\n$$G(\\omega_0) = J(\\omega_0) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1} + 1 \\right) = J(\\omega_0) \\left( \\frac{1 + \\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1} \\right) = J(\\omega_0) \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0)}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1}$$\n$$G(-\\omega_0) = J(\\omega_0) \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1}$$\nThese are the final expressions for the transition rates.\n\nFinally, we must verify the quantum detailed balance condition, $G(-\\omega_{0})=\\exp(-\\beta \\omega_{0})\\,G(\\omega_{0})$. This condition ensures that, in the absence of external driving, the system will eventually thermalize to the Gibbs state at the same temperature as the bath. Let's substitute our derived expressions into the right-hand side of the condition:\n$$\\exp(-\\beta \\omega_0) G(\\omega_0) = \\exp(-\\beta \\omega_0) \\left( J(\\omega_0) \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0)}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1} \\right)$$\n$$= J(\\omega_0) \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\omega_0) \\exp(\\beta \\omega_0)}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1} = J(\\omega_0) \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1}$$\nThis result is precisely our expression for $G(-\\omega_0)$. Thus, the condition $G(-\\omega_{0})=\\exp(-\\beta \\omega_{0})\\,G(\\omega_{0})$ is verified.\n\nThe final answer requires the closed-form expressions for $G(\\omega_0)$ and $G(-\\omega_0)$.\n$G(\\omega_0)$ is the downward (emission) transition rate.\n$G(-\\omega_0)$ is the upward (absorption) transition rate.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the standard theory of open quantum systems, specifically the Born-Markov-secular treatment of a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a thermal bath. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous derivation. It represents a standard-form problem in quantum optics and thermodynamics.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the four required parts in sequence. We take $\\hbar=1$ and $k_B=1$ as per the problem statement.\n\n1. Derivation of the Gorini–Kossakowski–Sudarshan–Lindblad (GKSL) generator.\n\nThe total Hamiltonian is $H_{\\mathrm{tot}} = H + H_{\\mathrm{B}} + H_{\\mathrm{I}}$, where $H=\\omega\\,a^{\\dagger}a$ is the system Hamiltonian, $H_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the bath Hamiltonian, and $H_{\\mathrm{I}}=\\epsilon\\,x\\otimes B$ is the interaction Hamiltonian with $x=a+a^{\\dagger}$. We work in the interaction picture with respect to $H_0 = H+H_B$. The interaction Hamiltonian in this picture is $H_{\\mathrm{I}}(t) = \\exp(iH_0 t) H_{\\mathrm{I}} \\exp(-iH_0 t) = \\epsilon\\,x(t)\\otimes B(t)$, where $x(t) = \\exp(iHt)x\\exp(-iHt)$ and $B(t)=\\exp(iH_{\\mathrm{B}}t)B\\exp(-iH_{\\mathrm{B}}t)$.\n\nThe system operator $x(t)$ can be decomposed using the time evolution of the ladder operators:\n$a(t) = \\exp(i\\omega a^{\\dagger}at)a\\exp(-i\\omega a^{\\dagger}at) = a\\exp(-i\\omega t)$\n$a^{\\dagger}(t) = \\exp(i\\omega a^{\\dagger}at)a^{\\dagger}\\exp(-i\\omega a^{\\dagger}at) = a^{\\dagger}\\exp(i\\omega t)$\nThus, $x(t) = a\\exp(-i\\omega t) + a^{\\dagger}\\exp(i\\omega t)$.\n\nThe interaction Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{I}}(t)$ involves system operators that are eigenoperators of the adjoint action of the system Hamiltonian, i.e., $[H, A_{\\nu}] = -\\nu A_{\\nu}$. For $A=a$, we have $[H, a] = [\\omega a^{\\dagger}a, a] = -\\omega a$, so the associated frequency is $\\omega$. For $A=a^{\\dagger}$, we have $[H, a^{\\dagger}] = [\\omega a^{\\dagger}a, a^{\\dagger}] = +\\omega a^{\\dagger}$, so the associated frequency is $-\\omega$.\n\nUnder the Born-Markov and secular approximations, the master equation for the reduced system density operator $\\rho$ in the Schrödinger picture is given by the GKSL form:\n$$ \\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = \\mathcal{L}(\\rho) = \\sum_{\\nu} \\gamma(\\nu) \\left( A_{\\nu} \\rho A_{\\nu}^{\\dagger} - \\frac{1}{2} \\{A_{\\nu}^{\\dagger}A_{\\nu}, \\rho\\} \\right) $$\nwhere the sum is over the unique Bohr frequencies $\\nu$ of the system, $A_{\\nu}$ are the corresponding system eigenoperators from the decomposition of the interaction operator, and $\\gamma(\\nu)$ are the associated rates.\n\nIn our case, the system operator is $x=a+a^{\\dagger}$. The eigenoperators are $A_{\\omega}=a$ and $A_{-\\omega}=a^{\\dagger}$. The rates $\\gamma(\\nu)$ are determined by the Fourier transform of the bath correlation function, $S_B(\\nu) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\nu t} \\langle B(t)B(0) \\rangle_{\\beta} dt$. Specifically, the rates are given by $\\gamma(\\nu) = \\epsilon^2 S_B(\\nu)$.\n\nThus, we have two jump processes:\n- One associated with the operator $A_{\\omega}=a$ with frequency $\\omega$. The rate is $\\gamma(\\omega) = \\epsilon^2 S_B(\\omega)$. This corresponds to the annihilation of a quantum of energy $\\omega$ from the oscillator.\n- One associated with the operator $A_{-\\omega}=a^{\\dagger}$ with frequency $-\\omega$. The rate is $\\gamma(-\\omega) = \\epsilon^2 S_B(-\\omega)$. This corresponds to the creation of a quantum of energy $\\omega$ in the oscillator.\n\nThe GKSL generator is therefore:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\rho) = \\gamma(\\omega) \\left( a \\rho a^{\\dagger} - \\frac{1}{2} \\{a^{\\dagger}a, \\rho\\} \\right) + \\gamma(-\\omega) \\left( a^{\\dagger} \\rho a - \\frac{1}{2} \\{a a^{\\dagger}, \\rho\\} \\right) $$\nThis shows that the only jump operators are $a$ and $a^{\\dagger}$ with rates $\\gamma(\\omega)$ and $\\gamma(-\\omega)$, respectively.\n\n2. Demonstration of quantum detailed balance.\n\nThe problem provides the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition for the bath correlation function: $S_B(-\\omega) = \\exp(-\\beta\\omega)S_B(\\omega)$.\nUsing the definitions of the rates from part 1, we can relate them:\n$$ \\gamma(-\\omega) = \\epsilon^2 S_B(-\\omega) = \\epsilon^2 \\exp(-\\beta\\omega) S_B(\\omega) = \\exp(-\\beta\\omega) \\gamma(\\omega) $$\nThis relation, $\\gamma(-\\omega) = \\exp(-\\beta\\omega) \\gamma(\\omega)$, is the quantum detailed balance condition. It links the rate of excitation (energy absorption from the bath) to the rate of decay (energy emission to the bath).\n\nNext, we express these rates in terms of the Bose-Einstein occupation factor $n(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta\\omega)-1}$.\nWe consider the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{n(\\omega)}{n(\\omega)+1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta\\omega)-1}}{\\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta\\omega)-1}+1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta\\omega)-1}}{\\frac{\\exp(\\beta\\omega)}{\\exp(\\beta\\omega)-1}} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta\\omega)} = \\exp(-\\beta\\omega) $$\nComparing this with the detailed balance condition, we see that $\\frac{\\gamma(-\\omega)}{\\gamma(\\omega)} = \\frac{n(\\omega)}{n(\\omega)+1}$.\nThis allows us to parameterize the two rates with a single function $\\Gamma(\\omega)$ as follows:\nLet the decay rate be $\\gamma(\\omega) = \\Gamma(\\omega)(n(\\omega)+1)$.\nThen the excitation rate is $\\gamma(-\\omega) = \\gamma(\\omega) \\exp(-\\beta\\omega) = \\Gamma(\\omega)(n(\\omega)+1) \\exp(-\\beta\\omega)$.\nSince $(n(\\omega)+1)\\exp(-\\beta\\omega) = (\\frac{\\exp(\\beta\\omega)}{\\exp(\\beta\\omega)-1})\\exp(-\\beta\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta\\omega)-1} = n(\\omega)$, we have:\n$$ \\gamma(\\omega) = \\Gamma(\\omega)(n(\\omega)+1) \\quad (\\text{decay rate, associated with } a) $$\n$$ \\gamma(-\\omega) = \\Gamma(\\omega)n(\\omega) \\quad (\\text{excitation rate, associated with } a^{\\dagger}) $$\nThis decomposition is physically intuitive: the excitation rate is proportional to the thermal occupation $n(\\omega)$ of the bath modes, while the decay rate has a spontaneous term (the '$+1$') and a stimulated term proportional to $n(\\omega)$.\n\n3. Stationarity of the Gibbs state.\n\nThe Gibbs state for the harmonic oscillator is $\\rho_{\\beta} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta H)}{Z} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta\\omega a^{\\dagger}a)}{Z}$, where $Z=\\mathrm{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta\\omega a^{\\dagger}a)]$. This state is diagonal in the number basis $|n\\rangle$. The dynamics described by the GKSL generator does not create coherences if the initial state is diagonal. Therefore, to prove stationarity, it is sufficient to show that the populations $P_n = \\langle n|\\rho|n\\rangle$ are stationary.\n\nThe time evolution of the populations is given by the Pauli master equation, which can be derived from the GKSL equation:\n$$ \\dot{P}_n = \\sum_{m} (W_{n \\leftarrow m}P_m - W_{m \\leftarrow n}P_n) $$\nThe transition rate from state $|m\\rangle$ to $|n\\rangle$ is given by the sum of contributions from all jump operators.\nThe operator $a$ causes transitions from $|m\\rangle$ to $|m-1\\rangle$. The rate is proportional to $|\\langle m-1|a|m\\rangle|^2 = m$. So the total rate of transition from $|m\\rangle$ to $|m-1\\rangle$ is $\\gamma(\\omega)m P_m$.\nThe operator $a^{\\dagger}$ causes transitions from $|m\\rangle$ to $|m+1\\rangle$. The rate is proportional to $|\\langle m+1|a^{\\dagger}|m\\rangle|^2 = m+1$. So the total rate of transition from $|m\\rangle$ to $|m+1\\rangle$ is $\\gamma(-\\omega)(m+1) P_m$.\n\nFor a stationary state, $\\dot{P}_n=0$ for all $n$. This is satisfied if the flux between any two adjacent levels is balanced (detailed balance for populations). Let's consider the flux between levels $|n\\rangle$ and $|n+1\\rangle$:\n$$ \\text{Flux}(n+1 \\rightarrow n) = \\text{Flux}(n \\rightarrow n+1) $$\n$$ \\gamma(\\omega) |\\langle n|a|n+1\\rangle|^2 P_{n+1} = \\gamma(-\\omega) |\\langle n+1|a^{\\dagger}|n\\rangle|^2 P_n $$\n$$ \\gamma(\\omega) (n+1) P_{n+1} = \\gamma(-\\omega) (n+1) P_n $$\nFor $n+1 \\ge 1$, we can divide by $n+1$:\n$$ \\gamma(\\omega) P_{n+1} = \\gamma(-\\omega) P_n $$\nThis gives the ratio of populations in the steady state:\n$$ \\frac{P_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{ss}}}{P_n^{\\mathrm{ss}}} = \\frac{\\gamma(-\\omega)}{\\gamma(\\omega)} = \\exp(-\\beta\\omega) $$\nThis recurrence relation implies $P_n^{\\mathrm{ss}} = P_0^{\\mathrm{ss}} (\\exp(-\\beta\\omega))^n = P_0^{\\mathrm{ss}} \\exp(-n\\beta\\omega)$.\nThis is precisely the form of the populations for the Gibbs state $\\rho_{\\beta}$, where $P_n = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta\\omega n)}{Z}$. Since the populations of the Gibbs state satisfy the detailed balance condition, they are stationary. As $\\rho_{\\beta}$ is diagonal, the full density matrix is stationary, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}(\\rho_{\\beta}) = 0$.\n\n4. Steady-state expectation value $\\langle a^{\\dagger}a\\rangle_{\\mathrm{ss}}$.\n\nThe steady state is the Gibbs state $\\rho_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\rho_{\\beta}$. The expectation value of the number operator $N=a^{\\dagger}a$ is:\n$$ \\langle a^{\\dagger}a\\rangle_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho_{\\beta} a^{\\dagger}a) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n P_n^{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\nFirst, we find the normalization constant $P_0^{\\mathrm{ss}}$ from $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P_n^{\\mathrm{ss}} = 1$.\n$$ 1 = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P_0^{\\mathrm{ss}} \\exp(-n\\beta\\omega) = P_0^{\\mathrm{ss}} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (\\exp(-\\beta\\omega))^n $$\nThis is a geometric series with ratio $r = \\exp(-\\beta\\omega)  1$. The sum is $\\frac{1}{1-r}$.\n$$ 1 = P_0^{\\mathrm{ss}} \\frac{1}{1-\\exp(-\\beta\\omega)} \\implies P_0^{\\mathrm{ss}} = 1-\\exp(-\\beta\\omega) $$\nSo, the stationary distribution is $P_n^{\\mathrm{ss}} = (1-\\exp(-\\beta\\omega))\\exp(-n\\beta\\omega)$.\nNow, we calculate the expectation value:\n$$ \\langle a^{\\dagger}a\\rangle_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n (1-\\exp(-\\beta\\omega))\\exp(-n\\beta\\omega) = (1-\\exp(-\\beta\\omega)) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n (\\exp(-\\beta\\omega))^n $$\nTo evaluate the sum, let $x=\\exp(-\\beta\\omega)$. We use the identity $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} nx^n = x \\frac{d}{dx} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^n$.\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} nx^n = x \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{1-x} \\right) = x \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} = \\frac{x}{(1-x)^2} $$\nSubstituting back $x=\\exp(-\\beta\\omega)$:\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n (\\exp(-\\beta\\omega))^n = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta\\omega)}{(1-\\exp(-\\beta\\omega))^2} $$\nFinally, we compute the expectation value:\n$$ \\langle a^{\\dagger}a\\rangle_{\\mathrm{ss}} = (1-\\exp(-\\beta\\omega)) \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta\\omega)}{(1-\\exp(-\\beta\\omega))^2} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta\\omega)}{1-\\exp(-\\beta\\omega)} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(\\beta\\omega)$:\n$$ \\langle a^{\\dagger}a\\rangle_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta\\omega)\\exp(\\beta\\omega)}{(1-\\exp(-\\beta\\omega))\\exp(\\beta\\omega)} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta\\omega)-1} $$\nThis is the Bose-Einstein distribution, which gives the mean occupation number of a bosonic mode in thermal equilibrium at inverse temperature $\\beta$.",

The quantum detailed balance condition can be phrased as the generator $\\mathcal{L}$ being self-adjoint with respect to\n$$\n\\langle A, B \\rangle_{\\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}} = \\mathrm{Tr}\\!\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}^{1/2} A^{\\dagger} \\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}^{1/2} B\\right).\n$$\nFor Hamiltonian contributions, consider $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{H}}(\\cdot) = -i[H_{\\mathrm{LS}}, \\cdot]$. One checks\n$$\n\\langle A, \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{H}}(B) \\rangle_{\\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}} = -i\\,\\mathrm{Tr}\\!\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}^{1/2} A^{\\dagger} \\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}^{1/2} H_{\\mathrm{LS}} B - \\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}^{1/2} A^{\\dagger} \\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}^{1/2} B H_{\\mathrm{LS}}\\right).\n$$\nRearranging terms to compare with $\\langle \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{H}}(A), B \\rangle_{\\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}}$ introduces commutators of $H_{\\mathrm{LS}}$ with $\\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}^{1/2}$, and one finds\n$$\n\\langle A, \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{H}}(B) \\rangle_{\\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}} - \\langle \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{H}}(A), B \\rangle_{\\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}} = -i\\,\\mathrm{Tr}\\!\\left( [\\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}^{1/2}, H_{\\mathrm{LS}}] A^{\\dagger} \\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}^{1/2} B - \\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}^{1/2} A^{\\dagger} [\\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}^{1/2}, H_{\\mathrm{LS}}] B \\right).\n$$\nHence, the necessary and sufficient condition for the Hamiltonian part to be self-adjoint in the GNS sense is $[H_{\\mathrm{LS}}, \\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}] = 0$. In our case $H_{\\mathrm{LS}} \\propto \\sigma_{x}$ and $\\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}$ is a function of $\\sigma_{z}$, so $[H_{\\mathrm{LS}}, \\rho_{\\mathrm{G}}] \\neq 0$. This non-commutativity explicitly breaks the quantum detailed balance symmetry and drives coherences, which is reflected quantitatively by the nonzero trace distance computed above.",
