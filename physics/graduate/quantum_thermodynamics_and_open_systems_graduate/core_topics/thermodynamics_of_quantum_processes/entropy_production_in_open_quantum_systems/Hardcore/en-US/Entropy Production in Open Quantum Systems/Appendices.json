The qubit dynamics is Markovian and generated by a Gorini–Kossakowski–Sudarshan–Lindblad generator, ensuring the existence of a unique full-rank stationary state that is diagonal in the energy eigenbasis. Let the instantaneous state of the qubit be $\\rho=\\mathrm{diag}(p,1-p)$ in the energy eigenbasis, and let the stationary reference state be $\\sigma=\\mathrm{diag}(q,1-q)$ in the same basis, where $0p1$ and $0q1$. Starting from the fundamental definitions of von Neumann entropy and quantum relative entropy used in quantum thermodynamics, derive an explicit closed-form expression for the quantum relative entropy $S(\\rho\\|\\sigma)$ in terms of $p$ and $q$ only. Then, interpret the derived expression as a thermodynamic distance that controls entropy production in the qubit’s open-system dynamics. Express your final result as a single analytic expression. No numerical evaluation or rounding is required, and no units should be included in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The primary objective is to derive the quantum relative entropy $S(\\rho\\|\\sigma)$ for two specified quantum states representing a qubit. The quantum relative entropy between two density matrices $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ is defined as:\n$$\nS(\\rho\\|\\sigma) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[\\rho(\\ln\\rho - \\ln\\sigma)\\right]\n$$\nThis quantity is also known as the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the quantum context.\n\nThe problem specifies the instantaneous state $\\rho$ and the stationary reference state $\\sigma$ of the qubit in the energy eigenbasis. Since they are diagonal in the same basis, they commute. Their matrix representations are:\n$$\n\\rho = \\begin{pmatrix} p  0 \\\\ 0  1-p \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} q  0 \\\\ 0  1-q \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe constraints are $0  p  1$ and $0  q  1$. These constraints ensure that all diagonal elements of $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ are strictly positive, which is necessary for the logarithm to be well-defined and real.\n\nFor any diagonal matrix $D = \\mathrm{diag}(d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n)$, the matrix logarithm $\\ln(D)$ is simply the diagonal matrix whose elements are the logarithms of the original elements: $\\ln(D) = \\mathrm{diag}(\\ln d_1, \\ln d_2, \\ldots, \\ln d_n)$. Applying this rule to $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\ln\\rho = \\ln\\begin{pmatrix} p  0 \\\\ 0  1-p \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\ln p  0 \\\\ 0  \\ln(1-p) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\sigma = \\ln\\begin{pmatrix} q  0 \\\\ 0  1-q \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\ln q  0 \\\\ 0  \\ln(1-q) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the difference $\\ln\\rho - \\ln\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\ln\\rho - \\ln\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} \\ln p - \\ln q  0 \\\\ 0  \\ln(1-p) - \\ln(1-q) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)  0 \\\\ 0  \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p}{1-q}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we multiply this result by $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\rho(\\ln\\rho - \\ln\\sigma) = \\begin{pmatrix} p  0 \\\\ 0  1-p \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)  0 \\\\ 0  \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p}{1-q}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\begin{pmatrix} p\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)  0 \\\\ 0  (1-p)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p}{1-q}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, we take the trace (the sum of the diagonal elements) of the resulting matrix to find the quantum relative entropy:\n$$\nS(\\rho\\|\\sigma) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} p\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)  0 \\\\ 0  (1-p)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p}{1-q}\\right) \\end{pmatrix} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nS(\\rho\\|\\sigma) = p\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right) + (1-p)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-p}{1-q}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression is the explicit closed-form for the quantum relative entropy in terms of $p$ and $q$. Since the states $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ commute, the quantum relative entropy reduces to the classical Kullback-Leibler divergence between the probability distributions $P = \\{p, 1-p\\}$ and $Q = \\{q, 1-q\\}$ corresponding to the eigenvalues of the density matrices.\n\nThe interpretation of this expression as a thermodynamic distance that controls entropy production stems from its properties in the context of open quantum system dynamics described by a Gorini–Kossakowski–Sudarshan–Lindblad (GKSL) master equation.\n$1$. The quantum relative entropy is a measure of distinguishability between two states. It satisfies Klein's inequality, $S(\\rho\\|\\sigma) \\ge 0$, with equality holding if and only if $\\rho = \\sigma$. Although it is not a true metric (it is not symmetric, i.e., $S(\\rho\\|\\sigma) \\neq S(\\sigma\\|\\rho)$ in general), it functions as a directed \"distance\" from a state $\\rho$ to a target state $\\sigma$.\n\n$2$. For a system evolving under a GKSL equation towards a unique stationary state $\\sigma$, Spohn's theorem states that the relative entropy is a monotonically non-increasing function of time:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} S(\\rho_t\\|\\sigma) \\le 0\n$$\nThis means $S(\\rho_t\\|\\sigma)$ acts as a Lyapunov function for the dynamics, continuously decreasing as the state $\\rho_t$ approaches the stationary state $\\sigma$. The \"distance\" to equilibrium thereby always shrinks.\n\n$3$. The entropy production rate, $\\dot{\\Sigma}$, in the open system and its environment combined, is directly related to the rate of change of this relative entropy. Specifically, for a system coupled to a thermal bath leading to a thermal stationary state $\\sigma$, the total entropy production rate is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{\\Sigma}(t) = -\\frac{d}{dt} S(\\rho_t\\|\\sigma) \\ge 0\n$$\nThis fundamental result connects the microscopic dynamics, captured by the changing state $\\rho_t$, to the macroscopic, irreversible thermodynamics, quantified by entropy production. The total entropy produced during the relaxation process from an initial state $\\rho_0 = \\rho$ to the final stationary state $\\sigma$ is the integral of the rate, which equals the initial relative entropy:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{\\text{total}} = \\int_0^\\infty \\dot{\\Sigma}(t) dt = S(\\rho_0\\|\\sigma) - S(\\rho_\\infty\\|\\sigma) = S(\\rho\\|\\sigma)\n$$\nTherefore, the derived expression $S(\\rho\\|\\sigma)$ not only quantifies the initial distinguishability between the system's state and its final equilibrium state but also represents the total irreversible entropy generated during the entire relaxation process. It is the thermodynamic resource that is consumed as the system equilibrates, thus controlling the overall entropy production. A larger initial value of $S(\\rho\\|\\sigma)$ implies the system is further from equilibrium and a more irreversible process will unfold, leading to greater total entropy production.",

With $H_{\\mathrm{B}}=\\sum_{k}\\omega_{k} b_{k}^{\\dagger} b_{k}$ and $B=\\sum_{k} g_{k}(b_{k}+b_{k}^{\\dagger})$, we find:\n$$ B(t) = \\sum_{k} g_{k} (e^{iH_{\\mathrm{B}}t} b_{k} e^{-iH_{\\mathrm{B}}t} + e^{iH_{\\mathrm{B}}t} b_{k}^{\\dagger} e^{-iH_{\\mathrm{B}}t}) = \\sum_{k} g_{k} (b_{k}e^{-i\\omega_k t} + b_{k}^{\\dagger}e^{i\\omega_k t}) $$\nThe bath correlation function is $C(t) = \\langle B(t)B(0)\\rangle_{\\beta} = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho_{\\mathrm{B}} B(t)B(0))$.

The logarithm of $\\pi$ is:\n$$\n\\ln\\pi = \\ln(Z_{S}^{-1}\\exp(-\\beta H_{S})) = \\ln(Z_{S}^{-1})\\mathbb{I} + \\ln(\\exp(-\\beta H_{S})) = -\\ln(Z_{S})\\mathbb{I} - \\beta H_{S}\n$$\nThe equation of motion is $\\dot{\\rho}_{t} = -i[H_{S} + H_{d}, \\rho_{t}] + \\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{t})$. The heat flux is $\\dot{Q}(t) = \\operatorname{Tr}[H_{S}\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{t})]$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Delta\\sigma(t)$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\sigma(t) = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\left(-i[H_{S} + H_{d}, \\rho_{t}] + \\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{t})\\right)(-\\ln(Z_{S})\\mathbb{I} - \\beta H_{S})\\right] + \\beta \\operatorname{Tr}[H_{S}\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{t})]\n$$\nWe can expand the trace:\n$$\n\\Delta\\sigma(t) = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\dot{\\rho}_{t}(-\\ln(Z_{S})\\mathbb{I})\\right] + \\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\dot{\\rho}_{t}(-\\beta H_{S})\\right] + \\beta \\operatorname{Tr}[H_{S}\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{t})]\n$$\nThe first term is $-\\ln(Z_{S})\\operatorname{Tr}[\\dot{\\rho}_{t}]$. Since the dynamics are trace-preserving, $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}]=1$ for all $t$, which implies $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\dot{\\rho}_{t}]=0$. Thus, the first term vanishes.\n$$\n\\Delta\\sigma(t) = -\\beta\\operatorname{Tr}[\\dot{\\rho}_{t}H_{S}] + \\beta \\operatorname{Tr}[H_{S}\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{t})]\n$$\nNow, substitute the full expression for $\\dot{\\rho}_{t}$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\sigma(t) = -\\beta\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\left(-i[H_{S} + H_{d}, \\rho_{t}] + \\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{t})\\right)H_{S}\\right] + \\beta \\operatorname{Tr}[H_{S}\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{t})]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\sigma(t) = i\\beta\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[[H_{S} + H_{d}, \\rho_{t}]H_{S}\\right] - \\beta\\operatorname{Tr}[\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{t})H_{S}] + \\beta\\operatorname{Tr}[H_{S}\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{t})]\n$$\nBy the cyclicity of the trace, $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{t})H_{S}] = \\operatorname{Tr}[H_{S}\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{t})]$. Therefore, the last two terms cancel out.\n$$\n\\Delta\\sigma(t) = i\\beta\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[[H_{S} + H_{d}, \\rho_{t}]H_{S}\\right]\n$$\nWe expand the commutator: $[H_{S} + H_{d}, \\rho_{t}] = [H_{S}, \\rho_{t}] + [H_{d}, \\rho_{t}]$.\n$$\n\\Delta\\sigma(t) = i\\beta\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[[H_{S}, \\rho_{t}]H_{S}\\right] + i\\beta\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[[H_{d}, \\rho_{t}]H_{S}\\right]\n$$\nLet's analyze the first term. Using the definition of the commutator and the cyclicity of the trace:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[[H_{S}, \\rho_{t}]H_{S}\\right] = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left[(H_{S}\\rho_{t} - \\rho_{t}H_{S})H_{S}\\right] = \\operatorname{Tr}[H_{S}\\rho_{t}H_{S}] - \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}H_{S}^2] = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}H_{S}^2] - \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}H_{S}^2] = 0\n$$\nSo the first term vanishes, leaving:\n$$\n\\Delta\\sigma(t) = i\\beta\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[[H_{d}, \\rho_{t}]H_{S}\\right]\n$$\nUsing the cyclicity of trace again, $\\operatorname{Tr}[ABC] = \\operatorname{Tr}[CAB]$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[[H_{d}, \\rho_{t}]H_{S}\\right] = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left[(H_{d}\\rho_{t} - \\rho_{t}H_{d})H_{S}\\right] = \\operatorname{Tr}[H_{d}\\rho_{t}H_{S}] - \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}H_{d}H_{S}]\n$$\n$$\n= \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}H_{S}H_{d}] - \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}H_{d}H_{S}] = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}(H_{S}H_{d} - H_{d}H_{S})] = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}[H_{S}, H_{d}]]\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we arrive at the general expression for $\\Delta\\sigma(t)$ in terms of the commutator of $H_{S}$ and $H_{d}$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\sigma(t) = i\\beta\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\rho_{t}[H_{S}, H_{d}]\\right]\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNow, we specialize to the given qubit model. The Hamiltonians are $H_{S} = \\frac{\\omega}{2}\\sigma_{z}$ and $H_{d} = \\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\sigma_{x}$. We first calculate the commutator $[H_{S}, H_{d}]$:\n$$\n[H_{S}, H_{d}] = \\left[\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\sigma_{z}, \\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\sigma_{x}\\right] = \\frac{\\omega\\Omega}{4}[\\sigma_{z}, \\sigma_{x}]\n$$\nUsing the Pauli algebra relation $[\\sigma_{z}, \\sigma_{x}] = 2i\\sigma_{y}$, we get:\n$$\n[H_{S}, H_{d}] = \\frac{\\omega\\Omega}{4}(2i\\sigma_{y}) = i\\frac{\\omega\\Omega}{2}\\sigma_{y}\n$$\nNow we substitute this into our expression for $\\Delta\\sigma(t)$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\sigma(t) = i\\beta\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\rho_{t}\\left(i\\frac{\\omega\\Omega}{2}\\sigma_{y}\\right)\\right] = i^2\\beta\\frac{\\omega\\Omega}{2}\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}\\sigma_{y}] = -\\beta\\frac{\\omega\\Omega}{2}\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}\\sigma_{y}]\n$$\nThe final step is to evaluate $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}\\sigma_{y}]$ using the Bloch representation $\\rho_{t} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbb{I} + x(t)\\sigma_{x} + y(t)\\sigma_{y} + z(t)\\sigma_{z})$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}\\sigma_{y}] = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbb{I} + x(t)\\sigma_{x} + y(t)\\sigma_{y} + z(t)\\sigma_{z})\\sigma_{y}\\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\sigma_{y} + x(t)\\sigma_{x}\\sigma_{y} + y(t)\\sigma_{y}^2 + z(t)\\sigma_{z}\\sigma_{y}\\right]\n$$\nUsing the properties of Pauli matrices: $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\sigma_{i}] = 0$ for $i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$, $\\sigma_{y}^2 = \\mathbb{I}$, $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\mathbb{I}]=2$, $\\sigma_{x}\\sigma_{y} = i\\sigma_{z}$, and $\\sigma_{z}\\sigma_{y} = -i\\sigma_{x}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}\\sigma_{y}] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\operatorname{Tr}[\\sigma_{y}] + x(t)\\operatorname{Tr}[i\\sigma_{z}] + y(t)\\operatorname{Tr}[\\mathbb{I}] + z(t)\\operatorname{Tr}[-i\\sigma_{x}]\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\sigma_{i}]=0$, the terms with $\\sigma_{x}$ and $\\sigma_{z}$ vanish.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{t}\\sigma_{y}] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(0 + x(t) \\cdot 0 + y(t) \\cdot 2 + z(t) \\cdot 0\\right) = y(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\Delta\\sigma(t)$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\sigma(t) = -\\beta\\frac{\\omega\\Omega}{2}y(t)\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the difference in entropy production rates in terms of the specified parameters.",
