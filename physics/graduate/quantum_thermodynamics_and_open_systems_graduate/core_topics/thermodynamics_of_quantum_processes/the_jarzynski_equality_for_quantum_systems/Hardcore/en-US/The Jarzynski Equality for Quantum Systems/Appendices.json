The second task is to compute this free energy change for the given parameters.\n\nThe work $W$ is a fluctuating quantity determined by the outcomes of two projective energy measurements performed before and after the quench. Let the initial measurement in the eigenbasis of $H_i$, $\\{|n\\rangle\\}_{n \\in \\{g,e\\}}$, yield the energy eigenvalue $E_n^{(i)}$. The probability of this outcome is given by the diagonal elements of the initial density matrix $\\rho_i$ in this basis.

The probability of measuring $E_n^{(i)}$ is $p_n = \\langle n | \\rho_i | n \\rangle = \\exp(-\\beta E_n^{(i)})/Z_i$.\n\nAfter the first measurement, the state of the system collapses to $|n\\rangle$. The Hamiltonian is then instantaneously quenched from $H_i$ to $H_f$. As the quench is instantaneous, the state vector $|n\\rangle$ does not have time to evolve. Immediately after the quench, a second projective measurement is performed in the new energy eigenbasis of $H_f$, $\\{|m'\\rangle\\}_{m' \\in \\{g',e'\\}}$. The probability of obtaining the outcome $E_m'^{(f)}$, given the initial outcome was $E_n^{(i)}$, is determined by Born's rule: $p(m'|n) = |\\langle m' | n \\rangle|^2$.\n\nThe work performed for a specific sequence of outcomes $(n, m')$ is defined as $W_{m'n} = E_m'^{(f)} - E_n^{(i)}$. The exponential average of the work, $\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W) \\rangle$, is the average over all possible measurement outcomes, weighted by their respective probabilities:\n$$ \\langle \\exp(-\\beta W) \\rangle = \\sum_{n \\in \\{g,e\\}} \\sum_{m' \\in \\{g',e'\\}} p_n \\, p(m'|n) \\, \\exp(-\\beta W_{m'n}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the probabilities and work:\n$$ \\langle \\exp(-\\beta W) \\rangle = \\sum_{n,m'} \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_n^{(i)})}{Z_i} |\\langle m'|n \\rangle|^2 \\exp(-\\beta (E_m'^{(f)} - E_n^{(i)})) $$\nWe can simplify the exponential terms:\n$$ \\langle \\exp(-\\beta W) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z_i} \\sum_{n,m'} \\exp(-\\beta E_n^{(i)}) |\\langle m'|n \\rangle|^2 \\exp(-\\beta E_m'^{(f)}) \\exp(\\beta E_n^{(i)}) $$\n$$ \\langle \\exp(-\\beta W) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z_i} \\sum_{n,m'} |\\langle m'|n \\rangle|^2 \\exp(-\\beta E_m'^{(f)}) $$\nWe can change the order of summation:\n$$ \\langle \\exp(-\\beta W) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z_i} \\sum_{m'} \\exp(-\\beta E_m'^{(f)}) \\left( \\sum_n |\\langle m'|n \\rangle|^2 \\right) $$\nThe term in the parenthesis is a sum over the complete orthonormal basis $\\{|n\\rangle\\}$.

We complete the square in the exponent:\n$$\n-\\frac{x^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}} - \\beta x = -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^{2}} \\left( x^{2} + 2\\sigma^{2}\\beta x \\right) = -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^{2}} \\left( (x + \\sigma^{2}\\beta)^{2} - (\\sigma^{2}\\beta)^{2} \\right) = -\\frac{(x + \\sigma^{2}\\beta)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}} + \\frac{\\sigma^{4}\\beta^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}} = -\\frac{(x + \\sigma^{2}\\beta)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}} + \\frac{\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the integral for $I(w)$:\n$$\nI(w) = \\exp(-\\beta w) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x + \\sigma^{2}\\beta)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}} + \\frac{\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nI(w) = \\exp(-\\beta w) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x + \\sigma^{2}\\beta)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe integral is that of a Gaussian probability density function (with mean $-\\sigma^{2}\\beta$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$) over its entire domain, which equals $1$.\nThus, the inner integral evaluates to:\n$$\nI(w) = \\exp(-\\beta w) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{m}) \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{m}) \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}w \\, p_{\\mathrm{true}}(w) \\, I(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}w \\, p_{\\mathrm{true}}(w) \\exp(-\\beta w) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the constant term:\n$$\n\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{m}) \\rangle = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}w \\, p_{\\mathrm{true}}(w) \\exp(-\\beta w)\n$$\nThe integral is, by definition, the exponential average of the true work, $\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{true}}) \\rangle$.\n$$\n\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{m}) \\rangle = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right) \\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{true}}) \\rangle\n$$\nThis relation isolates the effect of the weak measurement readout, which manifests as a multiplicative factor $\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right)$.\n\nNow, we must evaluate $\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{true}}) \\rangle$ under the specified dynamics, which include QND backaction. The problem states that this calculation should identify the conditions under which the Jarzynski equality remains unaltered.\nThe critical condition provided is that $[H(t), H(t')] = 0$ for all $t, t' \\in [0, \\tau]$. A direct consequence of this commutation is that all Hamiltonians $H(t)$ share a common, time-independent eigenbasis. Let us denote this basis by $\\{|n\\rangle\\}$, such that $H(t)|n\\rangle = E_{n}(t)|n\\rangle$ for all $t$.\n\nThe initial state is the thermal Gibbs state $\\rho_{0} = \\exp(-\\beta H(0))/Z_{0}$, which is diagonal in this common eigenbasis:\n$$\n\\rho_{0} = \\sum_{n} \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_{n}(0))}{Z_{0}} |n\\rangle\\langle n|\n$$\nThe work protocol involves a Two-Projective Measurement (TPM) scheme. The first measurement is a projective measurement of energy at $t=0$. This projects the system into an eigenstate $|n\\rangle$ with probability $p_{n}(0) = \\langle n|\\rho_{0}|n\\rangle = \\exp(-\\beta E_{n}(0))/Z_{0}$, and the energy outcome is $E_{n}(0)$.\n\nThe system then evolves from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$. The dynamics include unitary evolution and a QND dephasing channel.\nThe unitary evolution operator $U(\\tau, 0)$ is also diagonal in the basis $\\{|n\\rangle\\}$ because $[H(t), H(t')] = 0$. Specifically, $U(\\tau, 0) = \\sum_n \\exp(-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_0^\\tau E_n(t')dt') |n\\rangle\\langle n|$. This operator does not induce transitions between the eigenstates $|n\\rangle$.\nThe QND backaction is described as a dephasing channel with Kraus operators that are diagonal in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis, which is our time-independent basis $\\{|n\\rangle\\}$. A state that is already diagonal in the dephasing basis, such as $|n\\rangle\\langle n|$, is a fixed point of the dephasing channel. That is, if the state is $\\rho = \\sum_n p_n|n\\rangle\\langle n|$, the channel $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho)$ leaves the populations $\\{p_n\\}$ unchanged.\nTherefore, if the system is in state $|n\\rangle$ after the first measurement, it remains in state $|n\\rangle$ throughout the evolution until $t=\\tau$. No transitions occur. This is the dynamical condition under which the Jarzynski equality is unaltered: the commutation of Hamiltonians at all times makes the dynamics effectively adiabatic in a quantum sense (no transitions between energy levels), which renders the dephasing backaction (which only suppresses coherences between these levels) completely ineffectual.\n\nAt $t=\\tau$, the second projective measurement of energy is performed. Since the system is in the state $|n\\rangle$, which is also an eigenstate of $H(\\tau)$, the measurement yields the energy $E_{n}(\\tau)$ with a probability of $1$.\nFor a process starting in state $|n\\rangle$, the work performed is uniquely determined as $w_{n} = E_{n}(\\tau) - E_{n}(0)$.\nThe overall work distribution $p_{\\mathrm{true}}(w)$ is the sum of these outcomes weighted by their initial probabilities:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{true}}(w) = \\sum_{n} p_{n}(0) \\delta(w - w_{n}) = \\sum_{n} \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_{n}(0))}{Z_{0}} \\delta(w - (E_{n}(\\tau) - E_{n}(0)))\n$$\nNow we can compute the exponential average for this \"true\" work distribution:\n$$\n\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{true}}) \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}w \\, \\exp(-\\beta w) \\, p_{\\mathrm{true}}(w)\n$$\n$$\n= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}w \\, \\exp(-\\beta w) \\sum_{n} \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_{n}(0))}{Z_{0}} \\delta(w - (E_{n}(\\tau) - E_{n}(0)))\n$$\n$$\n= \\sum_{n} \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_{n}(0))}{Z_{0}} \\exp(-\\beta(E_{n}(\\tau) - E_{n}(0)))\n$$\n$$\n= \\sum_{n} \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_{n}(0))}{Z_{0}} \\exp(-\\beta E_{n}(\\tau)) \\exp(\\beta E_{n}(0)) = \\frac{1}{Z_{0}} \\sum_{n} \\exp(-\\beta E_{n}(\\tau))\n$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{n} \\exp(-\\beta E_{n}(\\tau))$ is the definition of the partition function at time $\\tau$, $Z_{\\tau} = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta H(\\tau))]$.\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{true}}) \\rangle = \\frac{Z_{\\tau}}{Z_{0}}\n$$\nGiven the definition of the free energy difference $\\Delta F = -\\beta^{-1}\\ln(Z_{\\tau}/Z_{0})$, we can write this as:\n$$\n\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{true}}) \\rangle = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta F)\n$$\nThis confirms that under the specified conditions, the true work distribution $p_{\\mathrm{true}}(w)$ (including backaction) satisfies the standard Jarzynski equality.\n\nFinally, we combine our two results. The correction from the weak measurement readout is purely a prefactor to the standard Jarzynski term.\n$$\n\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{m}) \\rangle = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right) \\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{true}}) \\rangle = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right) \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta F)\n$$\nCombining the exponents gives the final expression:\n$$\n\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{m}) \\rangle = \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\Delta F + \\frac{\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right)\n$$",
