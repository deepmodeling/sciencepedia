Assume that over a fixed time interval the probability that the excited state undergoes a decay to the ground state is a parameter $\\gamma$ with $0 \\leq \\gamma \\leq 1$.

The ground state $|0\\rangle$ is a fixed point of the evolution, meaning $\\mathcal{E}(|0\\rangle\\langle0|) = |0\\rangle\\langle0|$.\n    2. The excited state $|1\\rangle$ decays to the ground state $|0\\rangle$ with probability $\\gamma \\in [0, 1]$.

The operator-sum (Kraus) representation is the standard mathematical framework for such dynamics (CPTP maps). The Bloch vector is the standard geometric representation for a single-qubit state. All concepts are firmly rooted in established quantum theory.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides sufficient constraints to uniquely determine the quantum map and the resulting affine transformation on the Bloch vector. The objective is clearly stated and a unique, meaningful solution is expected.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise, technical, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Consistency**: The constraints are self-consistent and standard for this physical scenario.\n- **Verdict**: The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and an exemplary exercise in the field of open quantum systems. It is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Step 3: Proceed to Solution**\n\n**Derivation of Kraus Operators**\n\nThe dynamic process involves two possible outcomes for the qubit: either it decays (an energy quantum is lost to the environment) or it does not. This suggests a description with two Kraus operators, $K_0$ and $K_1$. We define the qubit computational basis states and Pauli matrices in the standard representation:\n$|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $|0\\rangle\\langle0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -i \\\\ i  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\mathbb{I} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe transformation is given by $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = K_0 \\rho K_0^{\\dagger} + K_1 \\rho K_1^{\\dagger}$.\n\nLet's apply the physical constraints.\n1. The decay from $|1\\rangle$ to $|0\\rangle$ with probability $\\gamma$ is naturally associated with one operator, say $K_0$. This operator must map $|1\\rangle$ to a state proportional to $|0\\rangle$. To produce the term $\\gamma |0\\rangle\\langle0|$ from an initial state of $|1\\rangle\\langle1|$, we must have $K_0 |1\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\gamma} |0\\rangle$. Since there is no excitation from the zero-temperature environment, the ground state cannot be excited, so we infer $K_0 |0\\rangle = 0$. This leads to the operator $K_0 = \\sqrt{\\gamma} |0\\rangle\\langle1|$.\nIn matrix form:\n$$\nK_0 = \\sqrt{\\gamma} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\sqrt{\\gamma} \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n2. The complementary event is that no decay occurs. This is described by $K_1$.\nThe ground state $|0\\rangle$ is a fixed point. The action of $K_0$ on $|0\\rangle$ is $K_0|0\\rangle = 0$. For the full map $\\mathcal{E}(|0\\rangle\\langle0|)=|0\\rangle\\langle0|$, we need $K_1|0\\rangle\\langle0|K_1^\\dagger = |0\\rangle\\langle0|$, which implies $K_1|0\\rangle$ must be $|0\\rangle$ (up to a phase, which can be set to $1$). So, $K_1|0\\rangle = |0\\rangle$.\nIf the system is in state $|1\\rangle$ and does not decay, it remains in $|1\\rangle$. The probability of this is $1-\\gamma$. To produce the term $(1-\\gamma)|1\\rangle\\langle1|$ in the final state, we need $K_1|1\\rangle\\langle1|K_1^\\dagger = (1-\\gamma)|1\\rangle\\langle1|$, which implies $K_1|1\\rangle = \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}|1\\rangle$.\nCombining these actions, the operator $K_1$ is $K_1 = 1 \\cdot |0\\rangle\\langle0| + \\sqrt{1-\\gamma} \\cdot |1\\rangle\\langle1|$.\nIn matrix form:\n$$\nK_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\sqrt{1-\\gamma} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  \\sqrt{1-\\gamma} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Validation of Kraus Operators**\nWe must verify that these operators satisfy the trace-preserving condition $\\sum_k K_k^{\\dagger} K_k = \\mathbb{I}$.\n$$\nK_0^{\\dagger} K_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ \\sqrt{\\gamma}  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\sqrt{\\gamma} \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  \\gamma \\end{pmatrix} = \\gamma |1\\rangle\\langle1|\n$$\n$$\nK_1^{\\dagger} K_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  \\sqrt{1-\\gamma} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  \\sqrt{1-\\gamma} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1-\\gamma \\end{pmatrix} = |0\\rangle\\langle0| + (1-\\gamma)|1\\rangle\\langle1|\n$$\nThe sum is:\n$$\nK_0^{\\dagger} K_0 + K_1^{\\dagger} K_1 = \\gamma |1\\rangle\\langle1| + |0\\rangle\\langle0| + (1-\\gamma)|1\\rangle\\langle1| = |0\\rangle\\langle0| + (\\gamma + 1 - \\gamma)|1\\rangle\\langle1| = |0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\mathbb{I}\n$$\nThe condition is satisfied. The derived Kraus operators are correct.\n\n**Calculation of the Affine Transformation**\nThe initial state is $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbb{I} + x\\sigma_x + y\\sigma_y + z\\sigma_z)$, which has the matrix representation:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+z  x-iy \\\\ x+iy  1-z \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe final state is $\\rho' = \\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = K_0 \\rho K_0^{\\dagger} + K_1 \\rho K_1^{\\dagger}$. We compute each term separately.\n\nFirst term:\n$$\nK_0 \\rho K_0^{\\dagger} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\sqrt{\\gamma} \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+z  x-iy \\\\ x+iy  1-z \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ \\sqrt{\\gamma}  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma}}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} x+iy  1-z \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ \\sqrt{\\gamma}  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1-z  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nSecond term:\n$$\nK_1 \\rho K_1^{\\dagger} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  \\sqrt{1-\\gamma} \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+z  x-iy \\\\ x+iy  1-z \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  \\sqrt{1-\\gamma} \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+z  x-iy \\\\ \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}(x+iy)  \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}(1-z) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  \\sqrt{1-\\gamma} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+z  \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}(x-iy) \\\\ \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}(x+iy)  (1-\\gamma)(1-z) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we sum the two terms to find $\\rho'$:\n$$\n\\rho' = \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1-z  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+z  \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}(x-iy) \\\\ \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}(x+iy)  (1-\\gamma)(1-z) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho' = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma(1-z) + 1+z  \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}(x-iy) \\\\ \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}(x+iy)  (1-\\gamma)(1-z) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho' = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+\\gamma + z(1-\\gamma)  \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}x - i\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}y \\\\ \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}x + i\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}y  1-\\gamma - z(1-\\gamma) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe final state $\\rho'$ is parametrized by the new Bloch vector $(x', y', z')$:\n$$\n\\rho' = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+z'  x'-iy' \\\\ x'+iy'  1-z' \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nBy comparing the components of the matrix for $\\rho'$ from our calculation with its general parametrization, we can identify the transformation law for the Bloch vector components.\nFrom the off-diagonal elements:\n$x'+iy' = \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}x + i\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}y \\implies x' = \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}x$ and $y' = \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}y$.\n\nFrom the diagonal elements:\n$1+z' = 1+\\gamma + z(1-\\gamma) \\implies z' = (1-\\gamma)z + \\gamma$.\nWe can check this with the $(2,2)$ element: $1-z' = 1 - ((1-\\gamma)z + \\gamma) = 1-\\gamma - (1-\\gamma)z = (1-\\gamma)(1-z)$, which is consistent with our calculation.\n\nThus, the affine transformation on the Bloch vector is:\n$$\nx' = \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}x\n$$\n$$\ny' = \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}y\n$$\n$$\nz' = (1-\\gamma)z + \\gamma\n$$\nThe result expressed as a row vector $(x', y', z')$ is $(\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}x, \\sqrt{1-\\gamma}y, (1-\\gamma)z + \\gamma)$.",

The Kraus operators for the adjoint map are $\\{E_{k}^{\\dagger}\\}$.\n\nNow, we substitute this representation of $\\Phi^{\\dagger}$ into the definition of the Petz recovery map $\\mathcal{R}_{\\sigma,\\Phi}(\\rho)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{\\sigma,\\Phi}(\\rho) = \\sigma^{1/2} \\left( \\sum_{k} E_{k}^{\\dagger} \\left(\\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2} \\rho \\, \\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2}\\right) E_{k} \\right) \\sigma^{1/2}\n$$\nWe can rearrange the terms by moving the operators outside the sum and distributing the $\\sigma^{1/2}$ terms:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{\\sigma,\\Phi}(\\rho) = \\sum_{k} \\left(\\sigma^{1/2} E_{k}^{\\dagger} \\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2}\\right) \\rho \\left(\\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2} E_{k} \\sigma^{1/2}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression is in the form of an operator-sum representation, $\\mathcal{R}_{\\sigma,\\Phi}(\\rho) = \\sum_{k} K_{k} \\rho K_{k}^{\\dagger}$. To confirm this, we must check if the second term in the product is the adjoint of the first. Let $K_{k} = \\sigma^{1/2} E_{k}^{\\dagger} \\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2}$. Then its adjoint is:\n$$\nK_{k}^{\\dagger} = \\left(\\sigma^{1/2} E_{k}^{\\dagger} \\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2}\\right)^{\\dagger} = \\left(\\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2}\\right)^{\\dagger} \\left(E_{k}^{\\dagger}\\right)^{\\dagger} \\left(\\sigma^{1/2}\\right)^{\\dagger}\n$$\nSince $\\sigma$ and $\\Phi(\\sigma)$ are density operators, they are Hermitian. Their square roots and inverse square roots are also Hermitian. Thus, $(\\sigma^{1/2})^{\\dagger} = \\sigma^{1/2}$ and $(\\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2})^{\\dagger} = \\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2}$. Also, $(E_{k}^{\\dagger})^{\\dagger}=E_{k}$. Therefore,\n$$\nK_{k}^{\\dagger} = \\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2} E_{k} \\sigma^{1/2}\n$$\nThis matches the second term in the sum. Thus, the Kraus operators for the Petz recovery map $\\mathcal{R}_{\\sigma,\\Phi}$ are given by:\n$$\nK_{k} = \\sigma^{1/2} E_{k}^{\\dagger} \\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation for the specific qubit channel and state.\n\nThe given Kraus operators for the amplitude damping channel are:\n$$\nE_{0}=\\begin{pmatrix}10\\\\0\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad E_{1}=\\begin{pmatrix}0\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\\\00\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe corresponding adjoint Kraus operators are:\n$$\nE_{0}^{\\dagger}=\\begin{pmatrix}10\\\\0\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad E_{1}^{\\dagger}=\\begin{pmatrix}00\\\\\\sqrt{\\gamma}0\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe reference state is $\\sigma = \\operatorname{diag}(s, 1-s) = \\begin{pmatrix}s0\\\\01-s\\end{pmatrix}$. Since $\\sigma$ is diagonal, its square root is:\n$$\n\\sigma^{1/2} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\sqrt{s}0\\\\0\\sqrt{1-s}\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the state $\\Phi(\\sigma)$:\n$$\n\\Phi(\\sigma) = E_{0}\\sigma E_{0}^{\\dagger} + E_{1}\\sigma E_{1}^{\\dagger}\n$$\n$$\nE_{0}\\sigma E_{0}^{\\dagger} = \\begin{pmatrix}10\\\\0\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}s0\\\\01-s\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}10\\\\0\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}s0\\\\0(1-\\gamma)(1-s)\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nE_{1}\\sigma E_{1}^{\\dagger} = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\\\00\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}s0\\\\01-s\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}00\\\\\\sqrt{\\gamma}0\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\gamma(1-s)0\\\\00\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi(\\sigma) = \\begin{pmatrix}s+\\gamma(1-s)0\\\\0(1-\\gamma)(1-s)\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe inverse square root $\\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2}$ is also diagonal:\n$$\n\\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s+\\gamma(1-s)}}0\\\\0\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1-\\gamma)(1-s)}}\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we compute the Kraus operators $K_{0}$ and $K_{1}$ for the recovery map:\n$$\nK_{0} = \\sigma^{1/2} E_{0}^{\\dagger} \\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\sqrt{s}0\\\\0\\sqrt{1-s}\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}10\\\\0\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}\\end{pmatrix} \\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2}\n$$\n$$\nK_{0} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\sqrt{s}0\\\\0\\sqrt{(1-s)(1-\\gamma)}\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s+\\gamma(1-s)}}0\\\\0\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1-\\gamma)(1-s)}}\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{s+\\gamma(1-s)}}0\\\\01\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nK_{1} = \\sigma^{1/2} E_{1}^{\\dagger} \\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\sqrt{s}0\\\\0\\sqrt{1-s}\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}00\\\\\\sqrt{\\gamma}0\\end{pmatrix} \\Phi(\\sigma)^{-1/2}\n$$\n$$\nK_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix}00\\\\\\sqrt{\\gamma(1-s)}0\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s+\\gamma(1-s)}}0\\\\0\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1-\\gamma)(1-s)}}\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}00\\\\\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma(1-s)}{s+\\gamma(1-s)}}0\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe final step is to evaluate $\\mathcal{R}_{\\sigma,\\Phi}(|0\\rangle\\langle 0|)$ and then the specified matrix element. The input state is $\\rho_{in} = |0\\rangle\\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix}10\\\\00\\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe recovered state is $\\mathcal{R}_{\\sigma,\\Phi}(\\rho_{in}) = K_{0}\\rho_{in} K_{0}^{\\dagger} + K_{1}\\rho_{in} K_{1}^{\\dagger}$.\nLet's compute each term:\n$$\nK_{0}\\rho_{in} K_{0}^{\\dagger} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{s+\\gamma(1-s)}}0\\\\01\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}10\\\\00\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{s+\\gamma(1-s)}}0\\\\01\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{s}{s+\\gamma(1-s)}0\\\\00\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nK_{1}\\rho_{in} K_{1}^{\\dagger} = \\begin{pmatrix}00\\\\\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma(1-s)}{s+\\gamma(1-s)}}0\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}10\\\\00\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}0\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma(1-s)}{s+\\gamma(1-s)}}\\\\00\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}00\\\\0\\frac{\\gamma(1-s)}{s+\\gamma(1-s)}\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe recovered state is the sum of these two matrices:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{\\sigma,\\Phi}(|0\\rangle\\langle 0|) = \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{s}{s+\\gamma(1-s)}0\\\\0\\frac{\\gamma(1-s)}{s+\\gamma(1-s)}\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe required matrix element is $\\langle 1|\\,\\mathcal{R}_{\\sigma,\\Phi}(|0\\rangle\\langle 0|)\\,|1\\rangle$, which corresponds to the bottom-right entry of this matrix.\n$$\n\\langle 1|\\,\\mathcal{R}_{\\sigma,\\Phi}(|0\\rangle\\langle 0|)\\,|1\\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma(1-s)}{s+\\gamma(1-s)}\n$$",
