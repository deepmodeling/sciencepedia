The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\n### Derivation of the Relationship\n\nThe condition for thermodynamic equilibrium at the interface between the vapor and the condensed spherical nucleus is the equality of the chemical potentials of the species in each phase. Let $\\mu_v$ be the chemical potential in the vapor phase and $\\mu_c$ be the chemical potential in the condensed phase (the nucleus).\n$$ \\mu_v(p, T) = \\mu_c(r, T) $$\nwhere $p$ is the vapor pressure surrounding the nucleus of radius $r$ at temperature $T$.\n\nLet us define a reference state. The standard reference is a flat interface ($r \\to \\infty$) where the condensed phase is in equilibrium with its vapor at the equilibrium vapor pressure $p_0$ and temperature $T$. In this state, the chemical potentials are equal:\n$$ \\mu_v(p_0, T) = \\mu_{c, \\text{bulk}}(p_0, T) $$\n\nFor a curved nucleus, the pressure inside the condensed phase, $P_{in}$, is greater than the external vapor pressure, $p$, due to surface tension. This pressure difference is given by the Young-Laplace equation for a sphere:\n$$ \\Delta P = P_{in} - p = \\frac{2\\gamma}{r} $$\nThe chemical potential of the condensed phase is dependent on pressure. The change in chemical potential with pressure, for an incompressible substance with molar volume $V_m$, is given by $d\\mu_c = V_m dP$. Integrating from the pressure over a flat surface ($p_0$) to the pressure inside the nucleus ($P_{in}$) gives the chemical potential of the nucleus:\n$$ \\mu_c(r, T) = \\mu_{c, \\text{bulk}}(p_0, T) + \\int_{p_0}^{P_{in}} V_m dP' $$\nAssuming $V_m$ is constant with pressure:\n$$ \\mu_c(r, T) = \\mu_{c, \\text{bulk}}(p_0, T) + V_m (P_{in} - p_0) = \\mu_{c, \\text{bulk}}(p_0, T) + V_m \\left(p + \\frac{2\\gamma}{r} - p_0\\right) $$\nFor the vapor, assuming it behaves as an ideal gas, the chemical potential at pressure $p$ is related to its potential at the reference pressure $p_0$ by:\n$$ \\mu_v(p, T) = \\mu_v(p_0, T) + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_0}\\right) $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equilibrium condition $\\mu_v(p, T) = \\mu_c(r, T)$ gives:\n$$ \\mu_v(p_0, T) + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_0}\\right) = \\mu_{c, \\text{bulk}}(p_0, T) + V_m \\left(p - p_0\\right) + \\frac{2\\gamma V_m}{r} $$\nSince $\\mu_v(p_0, T) = \\mu_{c, \\text{bulk}}(p_0, T)$, these terms cancel, leaving:\n$$ RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_0}\\right) = V_m \\left(p - p_0\\right) + \\frac{2\\gamma V_m}{r} $$\nIn many physical situations, including nucleation from a vapor, the molar volume of the condensed phase $V_m$ is much smaller than that of the gas. Consequently, the term $V_m (p - p_0)$ is negligible compared to the other terms, particularly the term $RT \\ln(p/p_0)$. By making this standard approximation, we obtain the Kelvin equation:\n$$ RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_0}\\right) \\approx \\frac{2\\gamma V_m}{r} $$\nSolving for the supersaturation ratio, $S = p/p_0$:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_0}\\right) = \\frac{2\\gamma V_m}{rRT} $$\n$$ \\frac{p}{p_0} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\gamma V_m}{rRT}\\right) $$\nThis is the required relationship between the supersaturation ratio and the physical parameters of the system.\n\n### Calculation of the Supersaturation Ratio\n\nWe now use the derived formula to compute the supersaturation ratio for the given values:\n- $r = 2\\,\\text{nm} = 2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}$\n- $\\gamma = 0.60\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$\n- $V_m = 1.14 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$\n- $T = 350\\,\\text{K}$\n- $R = 8.314\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of the exponent:\n$$ \\frac{2\\gamma V_m}{rRT} = \\frac{2 \\times (0.60\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}) \\times (1.14 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{mol}^{-1})}{(2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}) \\times (8.314\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (350\\,\\text{K})} $$\nNumerator calculation:\n$$ 2 \\times 0.60 \\times 1.14 \\times 10^{-5} = 1.368 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nDenominator calculation:\n$$ (2 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 8.314 \\times 350 = 5819.8 \\times 10^{-9} = 5.8198 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nValue of the exponent:\n$$ \\frac{1.368 \\times 10^{-5}}{5.8198 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 2.350613 $$\nNow, we compute the supersaturation ratio:\n$$ \\frac{p}{p_0} = \\exp(2.350613) \\approx 10.4918 $$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{p}{p_0} \\approx 10.5 $$",

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of surface thermodynamics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and stated using objective, precise language.\n\nThe starting point for this derivation is the fundamental definition of the surface contribution to the Gibbs free energy, $G_s$, for a nanocrystal with multiple facet types. As stated in the problem, this is the sum over all facet types $i$ of the product of the specific surface free energy, $\\gamma_{i}$, and the facet area, $A_{i}$.
