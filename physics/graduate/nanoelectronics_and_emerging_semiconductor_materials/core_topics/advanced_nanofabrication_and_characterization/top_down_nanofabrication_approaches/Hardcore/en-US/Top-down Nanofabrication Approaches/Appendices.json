            "problem": "In chemically amplified photoresists used for optical lithography in top-down nanofabrication, photoacid diffusion during the Post-Exposure Bake (PEB) contributes to image blur. Consider a one-dimensional ($1$D) representation of an initially localized acid distribution in a resist film, where the acid concentration $c(x,t)$ evolves by diffusion with a constant diffusion coefficient $D$ during PEB. Assume an infinite domain and negligible reaction or evaporation losses during the short bake interval so that the governing transport is purely diffusive. Start from the definition of diffusive flux and mass conservation to obtain the governing equation for $c(x,t)$. Using these fundamentals, derive an expression for the root-mean-square diffusion length $L(t)$ of the acid after a bake time $t$, given an initially localized distribution at $x=0$.\n\nThen, interpret this $L(t)$ as the standard deviation of the Gaussian blur kernel that the acid diffusion convolves with the latent image, and compute the numerical value of the blur contribution for a PEB with diffusion coefficient $D = 1.8 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$ and bake time $t = 75\\,\\mathrm{s}$.

            "solution": "First, we derive the governing equation for the acid concentration $c(x,t)$ from first principles. The problem specifies a purely diffusive transport process. In one dimension, Fick's first law of diffusion states that the diffusive flux $J(x,t)$, which is the amount of substance passing through a unit area per unit time, is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient.\n$$\nJ(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial c(x,t)}{\\partial x}\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, which is given as a constant. The negative sign indicates that the net movement of the substance is from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.\n\nNext, we apply the principle of mass conservation. For a one-dimensional system, the rate of change of concentration at a point is equal to the negative of the spatial derivative of the flux at that point. This is expressed by the continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c(x,t)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J(x,t)}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThis equation states that the local concentration increases if there is a net influx ($-\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} > 0$) and decreases if there is a net outflux ($-\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} < 0$).\n\nBy substituting Fick's first law into the continuity equation, we obtain the governing partial differential equation for the concentration:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c(x,t)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-D \\frac{\\partial c(x,t)}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(D \\frac{\\partial c(x,t)}{\\partial x}\\right)\n$$\nSince the diffusion coefficient $D$ is constant, it can be taken out of the spatial derivative, yielding Fick's second law, also known as the diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c(x,t)}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\n\nNow, we derive an expression for the root-mean-square diffusion length, $L(t)$. This is defined as the square root of the mean square displacement, $\\langle x^2 \\rangle(t)$. The mean square displacement is the second moment of the concentration distribution:\n$$\n\\langle x^2 \\rangle(t) = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 c(x,t) dx}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} c(x,t) dx}\n$$\nThe problem states that there are negligible reaction or evaporation losses, which means the total amount of acid, $N_0 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} c(x,t) dx$, is conserved and thus constant in time. We can therefore find the time evolution of $\\langle x^2 \\rangle(t)$ by differentiating the numerator, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 c(x,t) dx$.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 c(x,t) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\frac{\\partial c(x,t)}{\\partial t} dx\n$$\nSubstitute the diffusion equation into this expression:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 c(x,t) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\left( D \\frac{\\partial^2 c(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} \\right) dx = D \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} dx\n$$\nWe evaluate this integral using integration by parts twice. For the first integration, let $u = x^2$ and $dv = \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} dx$. Then $du = 2x dx$ and $v = \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} dx = \\left[ x^2 \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} (2x) dx\n$$\nFor a localized distribution, the concentration $c(x,t)$ and its spatial derivatives must vanish as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. Therefore, the boundary term $\\left[ x^2 \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}$ is zero. We are left with:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 c(x,t) dx = -2D \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} dx\n$$\nFor the second integration by parts, let $u = x$ and $dv = \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} dx$.

The remaining integral is the total amount of acid, $N_0$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} dx = - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} c(x,t) dx = -N_0\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 c(x,t) dx = -2D (-N_0) = 2DN_0\n$$\nNow, we can find the time derivative of the mean square displacement $\\langle x^2 \\rangle(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle x^2 \\rangle}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\frac{\\int x^2 c dx}{N_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{N_0} \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\int x^2 c dx\\right) = \\frac{1}{N_0} (2DN_0) = 2D\n$$\nIntegrating this simple ordinary differential equation with respect to time from $t'=0$ to $t'=t$:\n$$\n\\langle x^2 \\rangle(t) - \\langle x^2 \\rangle(0) = \\int_0^t 2D dt' = 2Dt\n$$\nThe problem specifies an \"initially localized distribution at $x=0$\". This can be modeled as a Dirac delta function, $c(x,0) = N_0\\delta(x)$. For this initial condition, the mean square displacement at $t=0$ is:\n$$\n\\langle x^2 \\rangle(0) = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 N_0\\delta(x) dx}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} N_0\\delta(x) dx} = \\frac{0}{1} = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the mean square displacement at time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\langle x^2 \\rangle(t) = 2Dt\n$$\nThe root-mean-square (RMS) diffusion length $L(t)$ is the square root of this quantity:\n$$\nL(t) = \\sqrt{\\langle x^2 \\rangle(t)} = \\sqrt{2Dt}\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the characteristic diffusion length scales with the square root of time, a fundamental feature of diffusive processes. As the problem notes, for an initial delta function distribution, the solution to the diffusion equation is a Gaussian function whose standard deviation $\\sigma$ is precisely $\\sqrt{2Dt}$, so $L(t) = \\sigma(t)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the blur contribution $L(t)$ for the given parameters.\nThe given values are:\nDiffusion coefficient, $D = 1.8 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$\nBake time, $t = 75\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nUsing the derived formula for $L(t)$:\n$$\nL(t) = \\sqrt{2 \\times (1.8 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (75\\,\\mathrm{s})}\n$$\n$$\nL(t) = \\sqrt{2 \\times 1.8 \\times 75 \\times 10^{-18}}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nL(t) = \\sqrt{270 \\times 10^{-18}}\\,\\mathrm{m} = \\sqrt{2.70 \\times 10^{-16}}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nL(t) = \\sqrt{2.70} \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe numerical value of $\\sqrt{2.70}$ is approximately $1.64316767$.\n$$\nL(t) \\approx 1.64316767 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\nL(t) \\approx (1.64316767 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}\\right) = 1.64316767 \\times 10^{1}\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 16.4316767\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nL(t) \\approx 16.43\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$",

This means a $21.2\\%$ higher dose is required on the $\\mathrm{GaAs}$ substrate compared to the $\\mathrm{Si}$ substrate to achieve the same line width. This is physically expected, as the higher atomic number of $\\mathrm{GaAs}$ leads to stronger backscattering ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} > \\eta_{\\mathrm{Si}}$), which reduces the energy proportion from the highly localized forward-scattered beam.",
