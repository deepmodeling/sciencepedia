It is a standard exercise in polymer physics that tests the understanding of the order-disorder transition in diblock copolymers. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe state of a diblock copolymer melt is determined by the interplay between the enthalpic penalty of contacts between dissimilar blocks ($A$ and $B$) and the conformational entropy of the polymer chains. This balance is quantified by the product of the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, $\\chi$, and the total degree of polymerization, $N$.\n\nAccording to the seminal mean-field theory developed by L. Leibler, which utilizes the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) to analyze composition fluctuations, a symmetric diblock copolymer ($f=0.5$) undergoes an order-disorder transition (ODT) at a specific critical value of the product $\\chi N$. This transition marks the boundary between a high-temperature, homogeneous, disordered phase and a low-temperature, microphase-separated, ordered phase (typically with a lamellar morphology for symmetric copolymers).\n\nThe critical value for this transition in a symmetric diblock copolymer melt is given by:\n$$\n(\\chi N)_{ODT} = 10.495\n$$\nThe state of the system at a given temperature $T$ can be determined by comparing the value of $\\chi(T)N$ to this critical threshold:\n- If $\\chi(T) N < 10.495$, the system is in the **disordered** (homogeneous) state, as the entropic driving force for mixing dominates.\n- If $\\chi(T) N > 10.495$, the system is in the **ordered** (microphase-separated) state, as the enthalpic repulsion between the blocks dominates.\n\nThe problem requires us to evaluate $\\chi(T)N$ for the given system and make this comparison.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Flory-Huggins parameter $\\chi$ at the specified temperature $T = 473\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The temperature dependence is given by:\n$$\n\\chi(T) = \\alpha + \\frac{\\beta}{T}\n$$\nSubstituting the provided values $\\alpha = 0.037$ and $\\beta = 12.2$:\n$$\n\\chi(473\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 0.037 + \\frac{12.2}{473}\n$$\nPerforming the calculation for the second term:\n$$\n\\frac{12.2}{473} \\approx 0.02579323467\n$$\nThus, the value of $\\chi$ at $T=473\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is:\n$$\n\\chi(473\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.037 + 0.02579323467 = 0.06279323467\n$$\nNext, we calculate the product $\\chi(T)N$. The total degree of polymerization is given as $N = 200$.\n$$\n\\chi(T)N = (0.06279323467) \\times 200\n$$\n$$\n\\chi(T)N \\approx 12.55864693\n$$\nNow, we compare this value to the critical ODT threshold:\n$$\n12.55864693 > 10.495\n$$\nSince $\\chi(T)N > (\\chi N)_{ODT}$, the enthalpic repulsion between the $A$ and $B$ blocks is strong enough to overcome the entropic penalty of chain localization. Consequently, the diblock copolymer is in the **ordered, microphase-separated state** at $T = 473\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The weak guiding field mentioned in the problem will serve to align the resulting ordered domains (e.g., lamellae) with the substrate prepattern.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of $\\chi(T) N$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\chi(T)N \\approx 12.56\n$$",

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or departures from established scientific principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe equilibrium lamellar period $L_0$ is the one that minimizes the total free energy per chain, $F_{total}$. In the strong-segregation limit, this free energy is dominated by two competing contributions: the interfacial energy, $F_{int}$, which favors increasing the domain size to minimize the interfacial area per chain, and the chain stretching energy, $F_{stretch}$, which penalizes the deformation of polymer coils from their ideal random walk configuration and thus favors smaller domains.\n$$\nF_{total} = F_{int} + F_{stretch}\n$$\nWe will derive the scaling of each term with respect to $N$ and $L_0$.\n\n**1. Interfacial Energy per Chain ($F_{int}$)**\nThe interfacial energy per chain is the product of the interfacial tension, $\\gamma$, and the interfacial area occupied by a single chain, $\\Sigma$.\n$$\nF_{int} = \\gamma \\Sigma\n$$\nFor a symmetric diblock copolymer, the lamellar period $L_0$ is composed of an $A$-rich domain of thickness $L_0/2$ and a $B$-rich domain of thickness $L_0/2$. The volume of an $A$-block of a single chain is $(N/2)v$, where $N/2$ is the degree of polymerization of the block and $v$ is the monomer volume. In a melt, the polymer is space-filling. The volume occupied by the $A$-block of one chain can also be expressed as the product of its interfacial area $\\Sigma$ and the domain thickness $L_0/2$.\n$$\n\\Sigma \\left( \\frac{L_0}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{N}{2} \\right) v\n$$\nFrom this, we find the area per chain:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\frac{Nv}{L_0}\n$$\nThe problem states the scaling for interfacial tension:\n$$\n\\gamma \\propto k_B T a^{-2} \\chi^{1/2}\n$$\nThe monomer volume $v$ is dimensionally related to the statistical segment length $a$ as $v \\propto a^3$. Substituting these expressions into the equation for $F_{int}$:\n$$\nF_{int} \\propto (k_B T a^{-2} \\chi^{1/2}) \\left( \\frac{N a^3}{L_0} \\right) = k_B T \\frac{\\chi^{1/2} N a}{L_0}\n$$\nDividing by $k_B T$, the contribution to the dimensionless free energy is:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{int}}{k_B T} \\propto \\frac{\\chi^{1/2} N a}{L_0}\n$$\n\n**2. Chain Stretching Energy per Chain ($F_{stretch}$)**\nIn the strong-segregation limit, the blocks of the copolymer are stretched to fill their respective domains. The free energy required to stretch a Gaussian chain of $N_{seg}$ segments of length $a$ to an end-to-end distance $R$ scales as $F \\propto k_B T R^2 / (N_{seg} a^2)$.\nFor a symmetric diblock copolymer, each block (A and B) has a degree of polymerization $N_{seg} = N/2$. Each block is confined to a domain of thickness $L_0/2$. The chains are primarily stretched in the direction perpendicular to the interface, so the characteristic stretching distance is proportional to the domain size, $R \\propto L_0/2$.\nThe stretching energy for one block is:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{stretch, block}}{k_B T} \\propto \\frac{(L_0/2)^2}{(N/2) a^2} \\propto \\frac{L_0^2}{N a^2}\n$$\nThe total stretching energy per chain is the sum of the contributions from the $A$-block and the $B$-block. Due to symmetry, these contributions are equal, and the total stretching energy has the same scaling:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{stretch}}{k_B T} \\propto \\frac{L_0^2}{N a^2}\n$$\n\n**3. Minimization of Total Free Energy**\nThe total free energy per chain, in units of $k_B T$, is the sum of the two contributions. We can write this sum with dimensionless constants of proportionality $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{total}}{k_B T} = C_1 \\frac{\\chi^{1/2} N a}{L_0} + C_2 \\frac{L_0^2}{N a^2}\n$$\nTo find the equilibrium period $L_0$, we minimize $F_{total}$ with respect to $L_0$ by setting its derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d L_0} \\left( \\frac{F_{total}}{k_B T} \\right) = -C_1 \\frac{\\chi^{1/2} N a}{L_0^2} + 2 C_2 \\frac{L_0}{N a^2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n2 C_2 \\frac{L_0}{N a^2} = C_1 \\frac{\\chi^{1/2} N a}{L_0^2}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $L_0$:\n$$\nL_0^3 = \\frac{C_1}{2 C_2} \\chi^{1/2} N^2 a^3\n$$\nThis gives the scaling relationship for $L_0$:\n$$\nL_0 \\propto (\\chi^{1/2} N^2 a^3)^{1/3} = \\chi^{1/6} N^{2/3} a\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\chi$, $a$, and $v$ are fixed. Therefore, we can write the scaling of $L_0$ with $N$ as:\n$$\nL_0(N) = C N^{2/3}\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant incorporating $\\chi$, $a$, and other numerical factors.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Ratio $r$**\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $r \\equiv L_0(N/2) / L_0(N)$. Using the derived scaling law:\n$$\nL_0(N/2) = C \\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right)^{2/3}\n$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\nr = \\frac{L_0(N/2)}{L_0(N)} = \\frac{C (N/2)^{2/3}}{C N^{2/3}} = \\left(\\frac{N/2}{N}\\right)^{2/3} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2/3}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $r$:\n$$\nr = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2/3} = \\frac{1}{2^{2/3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}} \\approx 0.6299605249\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $0.6300$.",

It is not trivial, unrealistic, or unscientific.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to find the integer number of lamellae, $m$, that minimizes the total elastic free energy per unit trench length.\n\nThe elastic free energy density, $u$, which represents energy per unit volume, is given by:\n$$u = \\frac{1}{2} B \\epsilon^{2}$$\nwhere $B$ is the compressional modulus and $\\epsilon$ is the strain.\n\nThe total elastic free energy, $U$, stored in the block copolymer film within a trench of length $L$ is the product of the energy density and the volume $V = W t L$:\n$$U = u V = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} B \\epsilon^{2}\\right) (W t L)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the free energy per unit trench length, which we denote as $U_{L}$:\n$$U_{L} = \\frac{U}{L} = \\frac{1}{2} B \\epsilon^{2} W t$$\n\nTo find the preferred number of lamellae $m$, we must express $U_{L}$ as a function of $m$. The strain $\\epsilon$ is defined as:\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{d - L_{0}}{L_{0}}$$\nwhere $d$ is the actual lamellar period and $L_{0}$ is the bulk equilibrium period. For $m$ lamellae to fit perfectly within the trench of width $W$, the period must be $d = W/m$.\n\nSubstituting $d$ into the expression for strain gives:\n$$\\epsilon(m) = \\frac{W/m - L_{0}}{L_{0}} = \\frac{W}{m L_{0}} - 1$$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $\\epsilon(m)$ into the equation for $U_{L}$:\n$$U_{L}(m) = \\frac{1}{2} B W t \\left( \\frac{W}{m L_{0}} - 1 \\right)^{2}$$\n\nTo minimize $U_{L}(m)$ with respect to the integer $m$, we can observe that the pre-factor $\\frac{1}{2} B W t$ is a positive constant. Therefore, minimizing $U_{L}(m)$ is equivalent to minimizing the squared term $\\left( \\frac{W}{m L_{0}} - 1 \\right)^{2}$, which in turn is equivalent to minimizing the absolute value of the strain, $|\\epsilon(m)| = \\left| \\frac{W}{m L_{0}} - 1 \\right|$.\n\nThe strain would be zero if $m$ could take a non-integer value that satisfies $\\frac{W}{m L_{0}} - 1 = 0$.

The energy function $U_L(m)$ has a single minimum at the non-integer value $m_{ideal}$. For integer values of $m$, the minimum must occur at one of the two integers that bracket $m_{ideal}$.
