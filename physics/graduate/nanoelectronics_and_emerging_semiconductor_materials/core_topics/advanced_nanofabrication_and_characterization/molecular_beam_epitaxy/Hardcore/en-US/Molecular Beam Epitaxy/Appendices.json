This exquisite control is often monitored in real-time using Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED), where oscillations in the intensity of the reflected electron beam mark the formation of each successive monolayer. This exercise provides a practical demonstration of how to analyze raw RHEED data to precisely calibrate the deposition rate, a fundamental skill for any MBE operator .",

The growth process is monitored in real-time using Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED). The intensity of the specularly reflected electron beam in the RHEED pattern oscillates as each atomic layer is deposited. The time period of one full intensity oscillation corresponds exactly to the time required to deposit a single monolayer of AlN.\n\nTo determine the growth rate with high precision, the scientist records the time at which the RHEED intensity reaches a maximum. The timestamps for the first six consecutive maxima, measured from the moment the material shutters were opened, are as follows:\n$t_1 = 5.45$ s,\n$t_2 = 7.27$ s,\n$t_3 = 9.06$ s,\n$t_4 = 10.87$ s,\n$t_5 = 12.70$ s,\n$t_6 = 14.48$ s.\n\nUsing this data, calculate the average time required to deposit a single monolayer of AlN.

            "introduction": "Growing a high-quality crystal on a substrate made of a different material, a process known as heteroepitaxy, is a major strength of MBE but presents unique challenges. When a polar semiconductor like Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), with alternating atomic planes, is grown on a non-polar substrate like Silicon (Si), crystallographic defects can easily form. This problem explores the origin of one such defect, the anti-phase domain (APD), and demonstrates how understanding the atomic-scale structure of the substrate surface is key to preventing its formation .",

            "problem": "In the field of semiconductor manufacturing, the heteroepitaxial growth of a polar compound semiconductor, such as Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), on a non-polar substrate, like Silicon (Si), is a significant challenge. One prominent defect that arises is the Anti-Phase Domain (APD), where the sublattice occupation in the crystal is inverted.\n\nConsider the growth of GaAs on a Si(001) substrate via Molecular Beam Epitaxy. Both Si and GaAs have crystal structures based on the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. Si crystallizes in the diamond cubic structure, where all lattice sites are occupied by Si atoms. GaAs crystallizes in the zincblende structure, which consists of two interpenetrating FCC sublattices, one for Gallium (Ga) and one for Arsenic (As), displaced from each other by a vector of $(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4})a$, where $a$ is the lattice constant.\n\nThis structural difference means that along the [001] direction, the Si crystal is non-polar, with identical atomic planes repeating. In contrast, GaAs is polar, with alternating planes of Ga and As atoms. The spacing between adjacent (004) atomic planes is $a/4$ for both structures.\n\nA real Si(001) surface is not perfectly flat but exhibits terraces separated by atomic steps. A monoatomic step on the Si(001) surface has a height of $h = a_{\\text{Si}}/4$. When GaAs is grown on such a surface, crystal nucleation occurs on different terraces simultaneously. An APD is formed if the step height on the Si substrate does not correspond to a full crystallographic and chemical repeating unit of the GaAs crystal along the [001] direction.\n\nAssuming for simplicity that the lattice constants are approximately equal ($a_{\\text{Si}} \\approx a_{\\text{GaAs}}$), determine the minimum integer number of atomic layers that must constitute a single step on the Si(001) surface to ensure that the GaAs crystal structure remains in-phase across the step, thereby preventing the formation of this type of APD.",
            "solution": "GaAs in the zincblende structure consists of two interpenetrating face-centered cubic sublattices displaced by $(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})a$, so along the $[001]$ direction the sequence of atomic planes alternates chemically (Ga, As, Ga, As, ...).

To avoid an anti-phase domain, the GaAs crystal must be in-phase across the step, which requires that this offset correspond to an integer number of GaAs chemical periods along $[001]$:\n$$\nH_{n}=m\\,p_{\\text{chem}} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad m\\in\\mathbb{Z}.\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $H_{n}$ and $p_{\\text{chem}}$ and using the assumption $a_{\\text{Si}}\\approx a_{\\text{GaAs}}=a$, this condition becomes\n$$\nn\\frac{a}{4}=m\\frac{a}{2}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad n=2m.\n$$\nThus $n$ must be an even integer. The minimum positive integer satisfying this is\n$$\nn=2,\n$$\ncorresponding to a double-layer step of height $a/2$, which preserves the Ga/As sublattice registry across the step and prevents this type of anti-phase domain formation; any odd $n$ would invert Ga and As across the step and generate an APD.",
