            "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The provided model is a standard, albeit simplified, representation of a convection-dominated chemical vapor deposition process, suitable for a first-principles derivation. All necessary variables and constraints are provided to derive the requested expression for the film thickness growth rate.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the molar flux of precursor $i$ to the surface, $J_i$.\n\nThe problem states that the gas flow is a uniform stagnation inflow with an average normal speed $u$ given by:\n$$u = \\frac{Q}{A}$$\nwhere $Q$ is the total volumetric flow rate and $A$ is the effective cross-sectional area of the inflow.\n\nThe problem also specifies that the boundary layer resistance is negligible, meaning the supply of precursor species $i$ to the surface is dominated by convection from the bulk gas. The molar flux, $J_i$, which is the number of moles of species $i$ arriving at the substrate per unit area per unit time, can therefore be expressed as the product of the molar concentration of species $i$ in the bulk gas, $c_i$, and the speed of the gas normal to the surface, $u$.\n$$J_i = c_i u$$\nThe gas mixture is assumed to be ideal. The ideal gas law relates the partial pressure of a species, $p_i$, its molar concentration, $c_i$, the universal gas constant, $R$, and the absolute temperature, $T$, as follows:\n$$p_i = c_i R T$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the molar concentration $c_i$:\n$$c_i = \\frac{p_i}{R T}$$\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for $c_i$ and $u$ into the equation for the molar flux $J_i$:\n$$J_i = \\left(\\frac{p_i}{R T}\\right) \\left(\\frac{Q}{A}\\right)$$\nThis gives the final expression for the molar flux of precursor arriving at the surface:\n$$J_i = \\frac{p_i Q}{A R T}$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the film thickness growth rate, $G$.\n\nThe film growth rate, $G$, is the rate of change of the film's thickness. Let us consider the deposition over an infinitesimal area $dA$ on the substrate surface.\n\nThe molar flux of precursor arriving at the surface is $J_i$. The number of moles of precursor $i$ arriving at the area $dA$ per unit time is $J_i dA$. The sticking coefficient, $s$, represents the probability that an arriving molecule will incorporate into the growing film. Therefore, the molar rate of incorporation of species $i$ onto the area $dA$ is given by $s J_i dA$.\n\nThe problem states that one mole of the incorporated surface species corresponds to one mole of the solid formula unit. Thus, the molar rate of solid deposition onto the area $dA$ is also $s J_i dA$.\n\nTo find the mass of solid deposited per unit time, we multiply the molar deposition rate by the molar mass of the solid, $M_s$:\n$$\\text{Mass deposition rate on } dA = (s J_i dA) M_s$$\nTo find the volume of solid deposited per unit time, we divide the mass deposition rate by the mass density of the solid, $\\rho_s$:\n$$\\text{Volume deposition rate on } dA = \\frac{s J_i M_s dA}{\\rho_s}$$\nThe volume of material deposited on area $dA$ per unit time can also be expressed as the product of the area $dA$ and the film thickness growth rate $G$. The growth rate $G$ has units of length per time.\n$$\\text{Volume deposition rate on } dA = G \\cdot dA$$\nEquating the two expressions for the volume deposition rate:\n$$G \\cdot dA = \\frac{s J_i M_s dA}{\\rho_s}$$\nThe area element $dA$ cancels from both sides, yielding the growth rate $G$ as a function of the arriving molar flux $J_i$:\n$$G = \\frac{s J_i M_s}{\\rho_s}$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $J_i$ derived in Part 1 into this equation for $G$:\n$$G = \\frac{s M_s}{\\rho_s} \\left(\\frac{p_i Q}{A R T}\\right)$$\nCombining the terms gives the single closed-form analytic expression for the film thickness growth rate $G$ in terms of the given physical parameters:\n$$G = \\frac{s p_i Q M_s}{A \\rho_s R T}$$\nA dimensional analysis confirms the correctness of this expression. Given $s$ is dimensionless, $p_i$ is pressure (force/area), $Q$ is volume/time, $M_s$ is mass/mole, $A$ is area, $\\rho_s$ is mass/volume, $R$ is energy/(mole·temperature), and $T$ is temperature, the resulting units are length/time, as required for a growth rate.\n$$[\\text{G}] = \\frac{[\\text{M L}^{-1} \\text{T}^{-2}] [\\text{L}^3 \\text{T}^{-1}] [\\text{M N}^{-1}]}{[\\text{L}^2] [\\text{M L}^{-3}] [\\text{M L}^2 \\text{T}^{-2} \\text{N}^{-1} \\Theta^{-1}] [\\Theta]} = \\frac{[\\text{M}^2 \\text{L}^2 \\text{T}^{-3} \\text{N}^{-1}]}{[\\text{M}^2 \\text{L} \\text{T}^{-2} \\text{N}^{-1}]} = \\text{L T}^{-1}$$\nwhere M, L, T, N, $\\Theta$ are dimensions of mass, length, time, amount of substance, and temperature respectively.

All scaling relationships with pressure $P$ are derived under this condition.\n\n1.  Scaling of Gas-Phase Diffusivity $D$:\n    The binary diffusivity $D$ is given to scale as $D \\propto T^{3/2}/P$.

Therefore, the diffusivity scales inversely with pressure:\n    $$D \\propto \\frac{1}{P} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad D \\propto P^{-1}$$\n\n2.  Scaling of Boundary-Layer Thickness $\\delta$:\n    The problem statement provides the scaling for the hydrodynamic boundary-layer thickness as $\\delta \\propto 1/\\sqrt{P}$.

Using the scaling laws derived in Part 1:\n    $$ h_g \\propto \\frac{D}{\\delta} \\propto \\frac{P^{-1}}{P^{-1/2}} = P^{-1/2} $$\n    So, $h_g$ scales inversely with the square root of pressure.

It describes the classic von Kármán rotating disk flow, a canonical problem in fluid mechanics and transport phenomena with direct relevance to Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) systems. The provided equations, assumptions, and data are consistent and sufficient for a complete analysis. Therefore, I will proceed with a full derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the scaling for the boundary-layer thickness and mass transfer coefficient, an explanation of the implications for uniformity, and a final numerical evaluation. The analysis begins from the fundamental principles of momentum and mass transport.\n\nFirst, we derive the parametric scaling of the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness, $\\delta$. The flow is governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. For a steady, axisymmetric flow above an infinite rotating disk, a boundary layer forms where the fluid velocity transitions from the disk's rotational velocity to that of the quiescent gas far away. The problem suggests a scaling argument based on characteristic time scales, which provides physical insight without resorting to the full similarity solution of the governing partial differential equations.\n\nThe formation of the boundary layer is dictated by the interplay between the rotational motion imposed by the disk and the diffusion of momentum by viscosity. We can identify two key time scales:\n1. The characteristic time scale for rotation, $t_{rot}$, is the inverse of the angular speed, $\\Omega$. This represents the time over which the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, induced by rotation, act significantly on a fluid element.\n$$t_{rot} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\Omega}$$\n2. The characteristic time scale for viscous diffusion, $t_{visc}$, governs how long it takes for momentum to diffuse over a characteristic distance, which in this case is the boundary layer thickness, $\\delta$. This time scale is given by the ratio of the square of the length scale to the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$.\n$$t_{visc} \\sim \\frac{\\delta^{2}}{\\nu}$$\nThe steady-state boundary layer thickness, $\\delta$, is established when these two time scales are of the same order of magnitude. A fluid particle within the boundary layer is simultaneously subjected to rotational effects and viscous transport; the balance determines the extent of the viscous influence. Equating the two time scales yields:\n$$\\frac{\\delta^{2}}{\\nu} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\Omega}$$\nSolving for the boundary layer thickness, $\\delta$, gives the desired scaling relationship:\n$$\\delta \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{\\Omega}}$$\nThis fundamental result, first obtained by Theodore von Kármán, shows that the boundary layer thickness is independent of the radial position, $r$. It becomes thinner with increasing rotation speed $\\Omega$ (stronger inertial effects) and thicker with increasing kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ (stronger momentum diffusion).\n\nNext, we connect this hydrodynamic scaling to the gas-phase mass transfer coefficient, $k_m$. The flux of a dilute precursor species to the wafer surface at $z=0$ is described by Fick's first law. For transport in the axial ($z$) direction, this is:\n$$J_{z} = -D \\left. \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z} \\right|_{z=0}$$\nHere, $D$ is the molecular diffusivity of the precursor and $c$ is its concentration. The mass transfer coefficient, $k_m$, is defined by the linear flux law:\n$$J_{z} = k_{m}\\left(c_{b}-c_{s}\\right)$$\nwhere $c_b$ is the concentration in the bulk gas (far from the surface) and $c_s$ is the concentration at the surface. By approximating the concentration gradient across a thin concentration boundary layer of thickness $\\delta_c$, we can write:\n$$\\left. \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z} \\right|_{z=0} \\approx \\frac{c_s - c_b}{\\delta_c} = -\\frac{c_b - c_s}{\\delta_c}$$\nSubstituting this approximation into Fick's law gives:\n$$J_z \\approx D \\frac{c_b - c_s}{\\delta_c}$$\nBy comparing this with the definition of $k_m$, we find the relationship between the mass transfer coefficient and the concentration boundary layer thickness:\n$$k_m \\approx \\frac{D}{\\delta_c}$$\nThe problem states that the Schmidt number, $\\mathrm{Sc} \\equiv \\nu/D$, is of order unity. The Schmidt number represents the ratio of momentum diffusivity to mass diffusivity. When $\\mathrm{Sc} \\approx 1$, the rates at which momentum and mass are transported by diffusion are comparable. As a consequence, the thickness of the hydrodynamic boundary layer, $\\delta$, is approximately equal to the thickness of the concentration boundary layer, $\\delta_c$.\n$$\\mathrm{Sc} \\approx 1 \\implies \\nu \\approx D \\implies \\delta \\approx \\delta_c$$\nUsing this approximation, we can express $k_m$ in terms of the hydrodynamic parameters:\n$$k_m \\approx \\frac{D}{\\delta} \\sim \\frac{D}{\\sqrt{\\nu/\\Omega}} = D \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Omega}{\\nu}}$$\nThis scaling shows that the mass transfer coefficient increases with the square root of the rotation speed and depends on the material properties $D$ and $\\nu$.\n\nThe implication of this scaling for radial uniformity is profound. Both the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness, $\\delta \\sim \\sqrt{\\nu/\\Omega}$, and the resulting mass transfer coefficient, $k_m \\sim D\\sqrt{\\Omega/\\nu}$, depend only on parameters ($\\Omega$, $\\nu$, $D$) that are constant across the entire wafer surface. They are notably independent of the radial coordinate, $r$. This means that, under the assumed conditions, the mass transfer of precursors to the wafer is uniform across its radius. This uniformity of flux is a critical advantage of the rotating disk reactor geometry, enabling the growth of thin films with highly uniform thickness and composition, which is essential for the manufacturing of semiconductor devices.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the mass transfer coefficient for the given parameters, taking the order-one proportionality constant in the thickness scaling to be unity, as is standard in this engineering approximation. This leads to the expressions $\\delta = \\sqrt{\\nu/\\Omega}$ and, consequently, $k_m = D/\\delta$.\nThe given values are:\n$\\nu = 4.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$\n$\\Omega = 40\\ \\mathrm{rad/s}$\n$D = 3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the boundary layer thickness $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{\\Omega}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}}{40\\ \\mathrm{rad/s}}} = \\sqrt{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nNext, we use this thickness to calculate the mass transfer coefficient $k_m$. The Schmidt number is $\\mathrm{Sc} = \\nu/D = (4.0 \\times 10^{-5})/(3.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 4/3 \\approx 1.33$, which confirms the order-unity assumption. Using the approximation $\\delta_c \\approx \\delta$:\n$$k_m = \\frac{D}{\\delta} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact result of the calculation is $0.03$. Expressed with four significant figures, this is $0.03000$.",
