It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation:**\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the photoluminescence energy of the ground-state exciton ($E_{\\text{PL}}$) and the characteristic temperature for thermal ionization of this exciton ($T_{\\text{ion}}$).\n\n**Part 1: Exciton Emission Energy ($E_{\\text{PL}}$)**\n\nIn a direct-gap semiconductor, the minimum energy required to create a free electron in the conduction band and a free hole in the valence band is the bandgap energy, $E_{g}$. This defines the onset of the continuum of free-carrier states.\n\nAn exciton is a quasi-particle consisting of an electron and a hole bound together by their mutual Coulomb attraction. As a bound state, its energy, $E_{X}$, must be lower than the energy of the free electron-hole pair continuum. The energy difference between the continuum edge ($E_{g}$) and the ground-state exciton level is the exciton binding energy, $E_{b}$.\n\nThe energy of the ground-state ($1s$) exciton is therefore given by:\n$$E_{X} = E_{g} - E_{b}$$\nPhotoluminescence is the process of radiative recombination. When an electron and a hole in an excitonic state recombine, a photon is emitted. By the principle of energy conservation, the energy of the emitted photon, $E_{\\text{PL}}$, must equal the energy of the initial state, which is the exciton energy $E_{X}$. The problem specifies that other energy contributions, such as the exciton's center-of-mass kinetic energy and phonon interactions, are negligible. Thus, we have:\n$$E_{\\text{PL}} = E_{X} = E_{g} - E_{b}$$\nWe are given the values $E_{g} = 2.30~\\text{eV}$ and $E_{b} = 22~\\text{meV}$. First, we must express both energies in the same unit, electronvolts (eV).\n$$E_{b} = 22~\\text{meV} = 22 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{eV} = 0.022~\\text{eV}$$\nNow, we can compute the numerical value for $E_{\\text{PL}}$:\n$$E_{\\text{PL}} = 2.30~\\text{eV} - 0.022~\\text{eV} = 2.278~\\text{eV}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $2.278$ already has four significant figures.\n\n**Part 2: Thermal Ionization Temperature ($T_{\\text{ion}}$)**\n\nThermal ionization (or dissociation) of excitons occurs when the available thermal energy is sufficient to overcome the Coulomb binding energy, $E_{b}$, liberating the electron and hole into the free-carrier continuum. A standard criterion for estimating the temperature at which this process becomes significant is to equate the characteristic thermal energy, $k_{B}T$, to the binding energy, $E_{b}$. The problem explicitly provides this relation:\n$$k_{B} T_{\\text{ion}} \\approx E_{b}$$\nwhere $T_{\\text{ion}}$ is the characteristic ionization temperature and $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. We can solve for $T_{\\text{ion}}$:\n$$T_{\\text{ion}} = \\frac{E_{b}}{k_{B}}$$\nWe are given $k_{B} = 8.617\\,333\\,262 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{eV}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$ and we use $E_{b} = 0.022~\\text{eV}$. Substituting these values:\n$$T_{\\text{ion}} = \\frac{0.022~\\text{eV}}{8.617\\,333\\,262 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{eV}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}}$$\n$$T_{\\text{ion}} \\approx 255.305~\\text{K}$$\nThe problem instructs rounding this value to three significant figures.\n$$T_{\\text{ion}} \\approx 255~\\text{K}$$\n\nThe final numerical answers are $E_{\\text{PL}} = 2.278~\\text{eV}$ and $T_{\\text{ion}} = 255~\\text{K}$. These are to be reported as a two-element row matrix.",

Here, $a_1=1/\\tau_1$ and $a_2=1/\\tau_2$.\n$$ \\int_0^{\\infty} I(t) \\, dt = A_1 [-\\tau_1 \\exp(-t/\\tau_1)]_0^{\\infty} + A_2 [-\\tau_2 \\exp(-t/\\tau_2)]_0^{\\infty} $$\n$$ = A_1 (0 - (-\\tau_1)) + A_2 (0 - (-\\tau_2)) = A_1 \\tau_1 + A_2 \\tau_2 $$\n\nNext, we compute the numerator:\n$$ \\int_0^{\\infty} t I(t) \\, dt = \\int_0^{\\infty} t \\left[ A_1 \\exp(-t/\\tau_1) + A_2 \\exp(-t/\\tau_2) \\right] \\, dt $$\n$$ = A_1 \\int_0^{\\infty} t \\exp(-t/\\tau_1) \\, dt + A_2 \\int_0^{\\infty} t \\exp(-t/\\tau_2) \\, dt $$\nThis requires the standard integral $\\int_0^{\\infty} t \\exp(-at) \\, dt$, which can be solved using integration by parts, yielding $1/a^2$. For our case, with $a_1=1/\\tau_1$ and $a_2=1/\\tau_2$, the integrals are $\\tau_1^2$ and $\\tau_2^2$, respectively.\n$$ \\int_0^{\\infty} t I(t) \\, dt = A_1 \\tau_1^2 + A_2 \\tau_2^2 $$\n\nCombining the numerator and denominator gives the derived expression for the mean PL lifetime:\n$$ \\langle \\tau \\rangle = \\frac{A_1 \\tau_1^2 + A_2 \\tau_2^2}{A_1 \\tau_1 + A_2 \\tau_2} $$\nThe contributions of each decay component, $A_i \\tau_i$, represent the total intensity from that component, so the mean lifetime is the weighted average of the lifetimes $\\tau_i$, where the weights are the fractional intensities $f_i = A_i \\tau_i / \\sum_j A_j \\tau_j$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given parameters: $A_1 = 1.3$, $A_2 = 0.5$, $\\tau_1 = 0.85\\,\\text{ns}$, and $\\tau_2 = 5.2\\,\\text{ns}$.\nThe numerator is:\n$$ A_1 \\tau_1^2 + A_2 \\tau_2^2 = (1.3)(0.85)^2 + (0.5)(5.2)^2 = (1.3)(0.7225) + (0.5)(27.04) $$\n$$ = 0.93925 + 13.52 = 14.45925 \\, \\text{ns}^2 $$\nThe denominator is:\n$$ A_1 \\tau_1 + A_2 \\tau_2 = (1.3)(0.85) + (0.5)(5.2) = 1.105 + 2.6 = 3.705 \\, \\text{ns} $$\nThe mean lifetime is the ratio:\n$$ \\langle \\tau \\rangle = \\frac{14.45925}{3.705} \\, \\text{ns} \\approx 3.90263157... \\, \\text{ns} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\langle \\tau \\rangle = 3.903\\,\\text{ns}$.\n\nThe existence of multi-component PL decays is a hallmark of complex photophysics in emerging semiconductor materials, particularly in nanostructured systems and heterostructures like the one described. A single-exponential decay corresponds to a single, well-defined depopulation pathway for the excited state. Multi-exponential decays arise from the presence of multiple, parallel decay channels for the photoexcited carriers (excitons). The main physical reasons include:\n\n1.  **Material Heterogeneity**: In ensembles of colloidal nanocrystals, there is an inherent distribution in size, shape, and surface passivation. Different nanocrystals possess different photophysical properties, including distinct radiative and non-radiative recombination rates. The measured PL is an average over this inhomogeneous ensemble, leading to non-single-exponential kinetics.\n\n2.  **Multiple Recombination Channels**: Even within a single nanostructure, excitons can decay through several competing pathways:\n    *   **Intrinsic Radiative Recombination**: The ideal process where an electron-hole pair recombines to emit a photon. This process has a characteristic lifetime, often represented by the slowest decay component ($\\tau_2$ in this case).\n    *   **Trap-Assisted Non-Radiative Recombination**: Defects such as surface states, vacancies, or grain boundaries act as trapping centers. Carriers can be trapped at these sites and subsequently recombine non-radiatively. The trapping process itself is a kinetic step that introduces a fast decay component (often $\\tau_1$). The overall process quenches the luminescence efficiency.\n\n3.  **Interfacial Processes in Heterostructures**: The system is a heterostructure of perovskite nanocrystals and a 2D TMD layer. The interface introduces additional decay pathways:\n    *   **Charge Transfer**: If the energy levels of the perovskite and TMD form a type-II band alignment, it is energetically favorable for either the electron or the hole to transfer from the photoexcited perovskite to the TMD layer. This charge separation process is an efficient quenching mechanism for the perovskite's PL and manifests as a fast decay component. For the given system, the fast decay with lifetime $\\tau_1 = 0.85\\,\\text{ns}$ is likely attributable to such an interfacial charge transfer process.\n    *   **Energy Transfer**: Non-radiative energy transfer (e.g., Förster or Dexter transfer) can occur from the higher bandgap perovskite to the lower bandgap TMD, providing another fast decay channel.\n\n4.  **Excitation Density Effects**: At high laser fluences, multiple excitons can be generated within a single nanocrystal. This can lead to the formation of multi-exciton species like biexcitons and charged excitons (trions), which have different (typically faster) recombination lifetimes than single excitons due to processes like Auger recombination. This also contributes to multi-exponential behavior.\n\nIn summary, the observed bi-exponential decay indicates that at least two distinct processes govern the fate of photoexcited carriers. The faster decay ($\\tau_1$) is commonly associated with fast quenching mechanisms like carrier trapping or interfacial charge transfer, while the slower decay ($\\tau_2$) is typically linked to the intrinsic radiative recombination of the exciton population that has not undergone these quenching processes.",
