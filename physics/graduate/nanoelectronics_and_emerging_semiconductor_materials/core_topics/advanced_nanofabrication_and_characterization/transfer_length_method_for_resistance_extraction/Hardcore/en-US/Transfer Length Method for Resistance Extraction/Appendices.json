The two-terminal structures consist of identical metal contacts of width $W$ placed on the semiconductor with center-to-center spacings $L$. The measured two-terminal resistance between the contacts includes three physically distinct contributions that are known to add in series: the channel resistance between the contact edges, the resistance associated with charge injection under each metal-semiconductor contact, and any resistance external to the semiconductor segment (for example, probe leads and on-chip pad interconnects). A separate on-chip reference is also fabricated in which the same two probe pads are connected by a direct low-resistance metal jumper that bypasses the semiconductor entirely.

The model of series addition of channel resistance, contact resistance, and external parasitic resistance is the foundational principle of TLM. The use of specific test structures, such as a zero-gap (abutted) contact pair and a shorted pad structure (metal jumper), are valid and common experimental practices for isolating different resistance components.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

The measurement of $R_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ and $R(L=0)$ provides sufficient information. The clarification that $L=0$ implies abutted contacts with zero channel length removes any potential ambiguity in the definition of $L$.\n    - The numerical values are physically realistic for such test structures.\n    - A unique and stable solution exists.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe problem states, based on first principles, that the total measured two-terminal resistance, which we denote as $R_{\\text{total}}$, is the series sum of three components: the channel resistance ($R_{\\text{ch}}$), the resistance from the two contacts ($2R_c$), and the external resistance ($R_{\\text{ext}}$). The per-contact resistance for a single contact is denoted as $R_c$.\n\nThe general model for the total measured resistance as a function of the geometry is:\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = R_{\\text{ch}} + 2R_c + R_{\\text{ext}}$$\n\nWe are given two specific measurements from specially designed reference structures.\n\n1.  **The Metal Jumper Measurement:**\n    A metal jumper connects the probe pads, completely bypassing the semiconductor device (the contacts and the channel). This measurement, therefore, isolates the external series resistance contribution from probes and pads.\n    The problem provides this value directly:\n    $$R_{\\text{ext}} = 0.54\\ \\Omega$$\n\n2.  **The Abutted-Contact ($L=0$) Measurement:**\n    This structure consists of two contacts placed such that their inner edges touch. The problem explicitly states that for this structure, there is \"no intervening semiconductor channel length.\" This means the channel resistance component is zero.\n    $$R_{\\text{ch}}(L=0) = 0\\ \\Omega$$\n    The total measured resistance for this structure, $R(L=0)$, is given as $5.72\\ \\Omega$. Applying our series resistance model to this specific case:\n    $$R(L=0) = R_{\\text{ch}}(L=0) + 2R_c + R_{\\text{ext}}$$\n    Substituting the known values:\n    $$5.72\\ \\Omega = 0 + 2R_c + R_{\\text{ext}}$$\n\nThe question asks for the intrinsic per-contact resistance, $R_c$, corrected for the external series resistance. This means we must first isolate the total resistance of the two contacts, $2R_c$, by subtracting the external resistance $R_{\\text{ext}}$ from the $R(L=0)$ measurement.\n\nWe have the equation:\n$$5.72\\ \\Omega = 2R_c + R_{\\text{ext}}$$\nSubstituting the value of $R_{\\text{ext}}$ from the metal jumper measurement:\n$$5.72\\ \\Omega = 2R_c + 0.54\\ \\Omega$$\nNow, we solve for $2R_c$, which represents the total resistance of the two contacts combined, corrected for external effects:\n$$2R_c = 5.72\\ \\Omega - 0.54\\ \\Omega$$\n$$2R_c = 5.18\\ \\Omega$$\n\nThe problem asks for the resistance of a single contact, $R_c$. We find this by dividing the total contact resistance by $2$:\n$$R_c = \\frac{5.18\\ \\Omega}{2}$$\n$$R_c = 2.59\\ \\Omega$$\n\nThis is the intrinsic per-contact resistance, corrected for external series resistance, as requested.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $2.59\\ \\Omega$**\nThis value matches our derived result for the per-contact resistance, $R_c$.\n$$R_c = (R(L=0) - R_{\\text{ext}}) / 2 = (5.72\\ \\Omega - 0.54\\ \\Omega) / 2 = 2.59\\ \\Omega$$\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $5.72\\ \\Omega$**\nThis is the raw measured resistance for the abutted-contact structure, $R(L=0)$. It is the sum of the resistance of two contacts ($2R_c$) and the external resistance ($R_{\\text{ext}}$). It is not the per-contact resistance and is not corrected for external resistance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $2.86\\ \\Omega$**\nThis value is obtained by incorrectly dividing the total measured resistance of the abutted structure by $2$: $5.72\\ \\Omega / 2 = 2.86\\ \\Omega$. This calculation fails to subtract the external resistance $R_{\\text{ext}}$ before dividing, thus erroneously distributing the external resistance between the two contacts.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $5.18\\ \\Omega$**\nThis is the value of $2R_c$, which is the total resistance of *two* contacts after correcting for the external resistance ($R(L=0) - R_{\\text{ext}} = 5.18\\ \\Omega$). The question specifically asks for the \"per-contact resistance $R_c$ (for one contact)\".\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $0.54\\ \\Omega$**\nThis is the value of the external resistance, $R_{\\text{ext}}$, measured using the metal jumper. It is a component of the total resistance but is not the contact resistance itself.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

A unique answer can be derived from the provided model and data.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is formulated with precise, quantitative language and objective data. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n-   **Consistency Check**: The data provided is internally consistent with the TLM model. For a fixed width $W$, the total resistance $R_{\\text{tot}}$ is expected to be a linear function of the channel length $L$. The data for each width represents three points on a straight line. For instance, for $W=2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, the resistance increases by $100\\,\\Omega$ for every $2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ increase in $L$, indicating a linear relationship. This holds for all three datasets.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and based on standard principles of semiconductor device characterization. The provided data is consistent with the underlying physical model. It is a **valid problem**. I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation of the TLM Model\nThe total resistance $R_{\\text{tot}}$ measured between two contacts is the sum of the resistance of the semiconductor channel between the contacts, $R_{\\text{ch}}$, and the resistance of the two contacts, $2 R_c$.\n$$ R_{\\text{tot}} = R_{\\text{ch}} + 2 R_c $$\n\n1.  **Channel Resistance ($R_{\\text{ch}}$)**: For a uniform resistive sheet with sheet resistance $R_s$, the resistance of a rectangular section of length $L$ and width $W$ is given by:\n    $$ R_{\\text{ch}} = R_s \\frac{L}{W} $$\n    Here, $L/W$ is the number of \"squares\" of the material.\n\n2.  **Contact Resistance ($R_c$)**: The problem states that the contact contribution can be described by a width-independent contact resistance per unit width. Let's denote this parameter by $R_{cW}$ (with units of $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{m}$ or, more practically, $\\Omega \\cdot \\mu\\text{m}$). The resistance of a single contact of width $W$ is then inversely proportional to its width:\n    $$ R_c = \\frac{R_{cW}}{W} $$\n    This model is valid for long contacts ($d \\gg L_T$), as specified in the problem statement, where $d$ is the contact length and $L_T$ is the transfer length.\n\n3.  **Total Resistance Equation**: Combining these components, the total resistance is:\n    $$ R_{\\text{tot}} = R_s \\frac{L}{W} + 2 \\frac{R_{cW}}{W} $$\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    $$ R_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{1}{W} (R_s L + 2 R_{cW}) $$\n    This is the fundamental equation of the Transfer Length Method for this geometry. The task is to find a plotting strategy that linearizes this equation in a way that the slope is $R_s$ and is independent of $W$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Plot $R_{\\text{tot}}$ versus $L$ for each $W$; the slopes will be equal across widths and directly yield $R_{s}$, and the intercept will be independent of $W$.**\n\nFor a fixed width $W$, the equation $R_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{R_s}{W} L + \\frac{2 R_{cW}}{W}$ is a linear function of $L$.\n-   The slope is $m = \\frac{dR_{\\text{tot}}}{dL} = \\frac{R_s}{W}$. The slope is inversely proportional to $W$ and is therefore **not** equal across widths.\n-   The y-intercept (at $L=0$) is $b = \\frac{2 R_{cW}}{W}$. The intercept is also inversely proportional to $W$ and is **not** independent of $W$.\n\nUsing the provided data:\n-   For $W=2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, the slope is $\\frac{(700-600)\\,\\Omega}{(4-2)\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = 50\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m}$.\n-   For $W=4\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, the slope is $\\frac{(350-300)\\,\\Omega}{(4-2)\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = 25\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m}$.\n-   For $W=8\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, the slope is $\\frac{(175-150)\\,\\Omega}{(4-2)\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = 12.5\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m}$.\nThe slopes are clearly not equal. Thus, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Plot $R_{\\text{tot}}$ versus $L/W$ for each $W$; the slopes will be equal across widths and directly yield $R_{s}$, and the intercept will be independent of $W$.**\n\nThe equation is $R_{\\text{tot}} = R_s \\left(\\frac{L}{W}\\right) + \\frac{2 R_{cW}}{W}$.\nLet the x-variable be $X = L/W$ and the y-variable be $Y = R_{\\text{tot}}$.\n-   The slope is $m = \\frac{dY}{dX} = R_s$. The slope is indeed constant and equal to the sheet resistance. This part of the statement is correct.\n-   The y-intercept is $b = \\frac{2 R_{cW}}{W}$. The intercept is dependent on $W$. Therefore, plotting the data in this way would result in a series of parallel lines, each with a different intercept. The statement that the intercept will be independent of $W$ is false.\n\nThus, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Plot $W\\,R_{\\text{tot}}$ versus $L$ for each $W$; the slopes will collapse to a single value equal to $R_{s}$ across widths, and the intercept will become a single constant equal to twice the contact resistance per unit width.**\n\nTo test this, we multiply the fundamental TLM equation by $W$:\n$$ W \\cdot R_{\\text{tot}} = W \\left( R_s \\frac{L}{W} + 2 \\frac{R_{cW}}{W} \\right) $$\n$$ W R_{\\text{tot}} = R_s L + 2 R_{cW} $$\nLet the y-variable be $Y = W R_{\\text{tot}}$ and the x-variable be $X = L$. The equation is in the linear form $Y = mX+b$.\n-   The slope is $m = \\frac{dY}{dX} = R_s$. This value is a physical constant of the material, independent of the geometry ($L$ or $W$).\n-   The y-intercept (at $L=0$) is $b = 2 R_{cW}$. This value is also a physical constant of the contact, independent of the geometry.\n\nBecause both the slope and intercept are independent of $W$, plotting $W R_{\\text{tot}}$ versus $L$ for all data points (regardless of their width $W$) should make them \"collapse\" onto a single straight line.\nLet's verify with the data:\n-   For $W=2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$: $W R_{\\text{tot}}$ values are $2 \\cdot 600 = 1200$, $2 \\cdot 700 = 1400$, $2 \\cdot 800 = 1600$. The units are $\\Omega \\cdot \\mu\\text{m}$.\n-   For $W=4\\,\\mu\\text{m}$: $W R_{\\text{tot}}$ values are $4 \\cdot 300 = 1200$, $4 \\cdot 350 = 1400$, $4 \\cdot 400 = 1600$.\n-   For $W=8\\,\\mu\\text{m}$: $W R_{\\text{tot}}$ values are $8 \\cdot 150 = 1200$, $8 \\cdot 175 = 1400$, $8 \\cdot 200 = 1600$.\nIndeed, all the transformed data points $(L, W R_{\\text{tot}})$ are: $(2\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 1200\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mu\\text{m})$, $(4\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 1400\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mu\\text{m})$, and $(6\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 1600\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mu\\text{m})$. These points lie on a single line.\nThe slope of this line is $\\frac{(1400 - 1200)\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mu\\text{m}}{(4-2)\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = 100\\,\\Omega$, which gives $R_s = 100\\,\\Omega/\\text{sq}$.\nThe intercept is $1200 - 100 \\cdot 2 = 1000\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mu\\text{m}$, which is $2 R_{cW}$.\nThis statement accurately describes the behavior. The plotting strategy effectively verifies the model by collapsing all data onto one line and allows for direct extraction of the physical parameters. Thus, this option is **Correct**.\n\n**D. Plot $R_{\\text{tot}}/L$ versus $1/W$; the slopes will collapse to a single value equal to $R_{s}$ across widths, and the intercept will be independent of $W$.**\n\nWe rearrange the fundamental equation by dividing by $L$:\n$$ \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}}}{L} = \\frac{R_s}{W} + \\frac{2 R_{cW}}{L W} $$\n$$ \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}}}{L} = \\left( R_s + \\frac{2 R_{cW}}{L} \\right) \\frac{1}{W} $$\nLet the y-variable be $Y = R_{\\text{tot}}/L$ and the x-variable be $X = 1/W$.\n-   The relationship is linear for a fixed $L$, with a y-intercept of $0$.\n-   The slope is $m = R_s + \\frac{2 R_{cW}}{L}$. This slope explicitly depends on the channel length $L$.\nTherefore, plotting the data this way would yield a set of lines (one for each value of $L$), all passing through the origin but with different slopes. The slopes do not \"collapse to a single value\".\n\nThus, this option is **Incorrect**.",

Normalize $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$ by $W$ and subtract the shortest-length resistance to remove $R_c$, then perform a linear fit versus $L$; any curvature in the original data is an artifact of width variation rather than $L$-dependent $R_{\\text{sh}}(x)$ and does not impact $R_c$ extraction.\n\nD. Use a two-length elimination scheme to cancel the channel contribution and isolate the contact term even under nonuniform $R_{\\text{sh}}(x)$: compute $2R_c$ from $R_{\\text{tot}}(L_1) + R_{\\text{tot}}(L_2) - R_{\\text{tot}}(L_1 + L_2)$, which removes both the linear and quadratic terms in $L$.\n\nE. Attribute the curvature of $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$ to current crowding near the contacts and fit an exponential model $R_{\\text{tot}}(L) = 2R_c + \\gamma\\left(1 - e^{-L/L_0}\\right)$; the intercept at $L=0$ then yields $2R_c$ exactly, and no further correction is needed for $L$-dependent $R_{\\text{sh}}(x)$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The system consists of bar-type test structures for the Transfer Length Method (TLM).\n- Structure width: $W$.\n- Set of contact separations: $\\{L_i\\}$.\n- Total two-terminal resistance function: $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$.\n- Measurement method: four-terminal Kelvin probing.\n- The semiconductor film has a longitudinal thickness gradient causing position-dependent resistivity.\n- Differential resistance element: $\\mathrm{d}R(x) = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{t\\,W}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$.\n- Sheet resistance definition: $R_{\\text{sh}}(x) = \\rho(x)/t$.\n- First-order model for sheet resistance variation: $R_{\\text{sh}}(x) = R_{\\text{sh},0} + \\beta x$.\n- Contact resistance at each interface: $R_c$, assumed constant.\n- The task is to propose a method to (i) detect and substantiate nonlinearity in $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$ and (ii) correct the extraction of $R_c$. The analysis must also quantify the bias in $R_c$ from a naive linear model fit.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on standard principles of solid-state physics and semiconductor device characterization. The TLM, the definition of resistance from resistivity, the concept of sheet resistance, and Kelvin probing are all fundamental and established concepts. Modeling a process gradient with a first-order linear approximation is a standard and reasonable approach.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear physical model and asks for a specific analysis based on it. The derivation of the total resistance, the analysis of model misspecification, and statistical testing are all well-defined mathematical and statistical tasks. A unique and meaningful solution can be derived.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased technical language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. The analysis can proceed.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe total measured resistance $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$ is the sum of the channel resistance, $R_{\\text{channel}}(L)$, and the two contact resistances, $2R_c$.\n$$R_{\\text{tot}}(L) = 2R_c + R_{\\text{channel}}(L)$$\nThe channel resistance is obtained by integrating the differential resistance element from one contact edge ($x=0$) to the other ($x=L$).\n$$R_{\\text{channel}}(L) = \\int_0^L \\mathrm{d}R(x) = \\int_0^L \\frac{\\rho(x)}{t W}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$$\nUsing the definition of sheet resistance, $R_{\\text{sh}}(x) = \\rho(x)/t$, this becomes:\n$$R_{\\text{channel}}(L) = \\frac{1}{W} \\int_0^L R_{\\text{sh}}(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x$$\nThe problem specifies a linear model for the spatially varying sheet resistance: $R_{\\text{sh}}(x) = R_{\\text{sh},0} + \\beta x$. Substituting this into the integral:\n$$R_{\\text{channel}}(L) = \\frac{1}{W} \\int_0^L (R_{\\text{sh},0} + \\beta x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{W} \\left[ R_{\\text{sh},0}x + \\frac{\\beta x^2}{2} \\right]_0^L$$\nThis evaluates to:\n$$R_{\\text{channel}}(L) = \\frac{R_{\\text{sh},0}}{W}L + \\frac{\\beta}{2W}L^2$$\nTherefore, the full expression for the total resistance is:\n$$R_{\\text{tot}}(L) = 2R_c + \\frac{R_{\\text{sh},0}}{W}L + \\frac{\\beta}{2W}L^2$$\nThis equation shows that a linear gradient in sheet resistance results in a quadratic dependence of the total resistance on the channel length $L$. The relationship is of the form $R_{\\text{tot}}(L) = C + aL + bL^2$, with $C = 2R_c$, $a = R_{\\text{sh},0}/W$, and $b = \\beta/(2W)$.\n\n### Analysis of the Protocol Requirements\n\n**(i) Detection of Nonlinearity:** The presence of a non-zero $\\beta$ term makes the function $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$ quadratic. To statistically detect this, one can fit the experimental data $(L_i, R_{\\text{tot}, i})$ to both a linear model ($R = C_{\\text{lin}}+a_{\\text{lin}}L$) and a quadratic model ($R = C_{\\text{quad}}+a_{\\text{quad}}L+b_{\\text{quad}}L^2$). A standard approach is to perform a hypothesis test on the quadratic coefficient, $H_0: b_{\\text{quad}} = 0$. A t-test on this coefficient can determine if it is statistically significant. Alternatively, if replicate measurements exist at each $L_i$, a formal lack-of-fit F-test can be performed. This test compares the variance of the residuals from the linear fit to the variance from pure experimental error (estimated from the replicates), providing a powerful way to detect model inadequacy.\n\n**(ii) Correction of $R_c$ Extraction and Bias Quantification:**\nThe correct method for extracting $R_c$ is to fit the data to the physically-derived quadratic model $R_{\\text{tot}}(L) = C + aL + bL^2$. The intercept $C$ of this fit provides the unbiased estimate of $2R_c$.\n\nIf one naively fits a linear model $y = \\hat{C}_{\\text{lin}} + \\hat{a}_{\\text{lin}}L$ to data that is truly quadratic, $y_i = C + aL_i + bL_i^2$, the least-squares estimators for the intercept and slope will be biased. The expected value of the estimated intercept $\\hat{C}_{\\text{lin}}$ can be found using the theory of misspecified models. Let a set of $n$ measurements be taken at lengths $\\{L_i\\}$. Let $M_k = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n L_i^k$ be the $k$-th sample moment of the lengths. The expected value of the intercept from a simple linear regression is:\n$$E[\\hat{C}_{\\text{lin}}] = C + b \\left( \\frac{M_2^2 - M_1 M_3}{M_2 - M_1^2} \\right)$$\nThe bias in the intercept, $\\Delta(C) = E[\\hat{C}_{\\text{lin}}] - C$, is therefore:\n$$\\Delta(2R_c) = b \\left( \\frac{M_2^2 - M_1 M_3}{M_2 - M_1^2} \\right)$$\nThis bias depends on the magnitude of the sheet resistance gradient (via $b=\\beta/(2W)$) and the specific set of lengths $\\{L_i\\}$ used in the experiment (via their moments $M_1, M_2, M_3$). The expression can be rewritten as:\n$$\\Delta(2R_c) = b \\left[ \\frac{M_2(M_2 - M_1^2) - M_1M_3 + M_1^2M_2}{M_2 - M_1^2} \\right] = b \\left[ M_2 - \\frac{M_1(M_3 - M_1M_2)}{M_2 - M_1^2} \\right]$$\nThis matches the expression given in option A.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use a residual-based lack-of-fit analysis to test for curvature, modeling the channel resistance from first principles as an integral over $R_{\\text{sh}}(x)$, and fit a physically motivated quadratic in $L$ when $R_{\\text{sh}}(x)$ is approximately linear. Specifically, posit $R_{\\text{tot}}(L) = 2R_c + \\frac{1}{W}\\int_0^L R_{\\text{sh}}(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x$ and, for $R_{\\text{sh}}(x) = R_{\\text{sh},0} + \\beta x$, fit $R_{\\text{tot}}(L) = 2R_c + aL + bL^2$ with $a = R_{\\text{sh},0}/W$ and $b = \\beta/(2W)$. Perform a formal lack-of-fit $F$-test comparing the quadratic to a linear model using replicate devices at each $L$. To quantify the bias from naively forcing a linear fit to $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$, derive the intercept error for least squares on $y_i = 2R_c + aL_i + bL_i^2$ in terms of the sample moments $M_k = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_i L_i^k$, showing $\\Delta(2R_c) = b\\left[M_2 - \\frac{M_1\\left(M_3 - M_1 M_2\\right)}{M_2 - M_1^2}\\right]$. Correct $R_c$ by either using the quadratic intercept or by independently mapping $R_{\\text{sh}}(x)$, for example via Van der Pauw (VDP) sheet resistance mapping across the wafer and constraining $a$ and $b$ while fitting for $R_c$.**\n\nThis option is fully consistent with the first-principles derivation. It correctly identifies the integral formulation for channel resistance, derives the correct quadratic model for $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$, proposes a valid statistical procedure (lack-of-fit F-test) for detecting nonlinearity, presents the correct formula for the bias in the intercept of a misspecified linear fit, and suggests sound strategies for correcting the $R_c$ extraction. The use of independent VDP mapping is a sophisticated and valid experimental approach. This option is comprehensive and scientifically rigorous.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Minimize the measurement current to reduce Joule heating and operate strictly in the ohmic regime, then proceed with a linear fit to $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$; nonlinearity observed at higher currents will disappear, and the intercept $2R_c$ remains unbiased regardless of $L$-dependent $R_{\\text{sh}}(x)$.**\n\nThis option incorrectly attributes the source of nonlinearity. The problem explicitly states that the nonlinearity arises from a spatially varying sheet resistance, $R_{\\text{sh}}(x)$, not from non-ohmic behavior like Joule heating. While minimizing current is good experimental practice, it does not linearize the $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$ function, which is inherently quadratic due to the sheet resistance gradient. The claim that the intercept $2R_c$ remains unbiased is false, as proven by the bias calculation above.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Normalize $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$ by $W$ and subtract the shortest-length resistance to remove $R_c$, then perform a linear fit versus $L$; any curvature in the original data is an artifact of width variation rather than $L$-dependent $R_{\\text{sh}}(x)$ and does not impact $R_c$ extraction.**\n\nThis option is flawed in multiple aspects. First, subtracting the resistance at one length, $R_{\\text{tot}}(L_{\\text{min}})$, eliminates the constant term $2R_c$, making its extraction impossible. The goal is to find $R_c$, not eliminate it. Second, the resulting function, $R_{\\text{tot}}(L) - R_{\\text{tot}}(L_{\\text{min}}) = a(L - L_{\\text{min}}) + b(L^2 - L_{\\text{min}}^2)$, is still quadratic in $L$, so a subsequent linear fit remains a model misspecification. Third, it dismisses the problem's premise about the source of nonlinearity without justification.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Use a two-length elimination scheme to cancel the channel contribution and isolate the contact term even under nonuniform $R_{\\text{sh}}(x)$: compute $2R_c$ from $R_{\\text{tot}}(L_1) + R_{\\text{tot}}(L_2) - R_{\\text{tot}}(L_1 + L_2)$, which removes both the linear and quadratic terms in $L$.**\n\nThis option proposes a mathematical identity that fails for the derived model. Let $f(L) = R_{\\text{tot}}(L) = C + aL + bL^2$. The proposed expression is $f(L_1) + f(L_2) - f(L_1+L_2)$.\n$$ (C+aL_1+bL_1^2) + (C+aL_2+bL_2^2) - (C+a(L_1+L_2)+b(L_1+L_2)^2) $$\n$$ = (2C+a(L_1+L_2)+b(L_1^2+L_2^2)) - (C+a(L_1+L_2)+b(L_1^2+2L_1L_2+L_2^2)) $$\n$$ = C - 2bL_1L_2 $$\nThe result is $2R_c - 2bL_1L_2$, not $2R_c$. The formula only works if $b=0$, which corresponds to the standard linear TLM model (uniform sheet resistance). It fails to isolate the contact resistance term in the presence of the quadratic term.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Attribute the curvature of $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$ to current crowding near the contacts and fit an exponential model $R_{\\text{tot}}(L) = 2R_c + \\gamma\\left(1 - e^{-L/L_0}\\right)$; the intercept at $L=0$ then yields $2R_c$ exactly, and no further correction is needed for $L$-dependent $R_{\\text{sh}}(x)$.**\n\nThis option substitutes a different physical model (transmission line model for contacts) for the one specified in the problem (nonuniform sheet resistance). The physics given in the problem leads to a polynomial dependence on $L$, specifically a quadratic. An exponential model, which saturates for large $L$, is not consistent with the integral of a linearly increasing sheet resistance. An analysis must be based on the provided premises, not on alternative, unsubstantiated physical scenarios.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
