            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the depletion width in a Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) MOSFET at the threshold of inversion, and to determine if the device is partially or fully depleted.\n\n### Step 1: Theoretical Derivation\n\nWe begin from the one-dimensional Poisson's equation, which describes the relationship between the electrostatic potential $\\psi$ and the space charge density $\\rho$ in a semiconductor. Let the coordinate $x$ be normal to the gate, with $x=0$ at the silicon-oxide interface and pointing into the silicon film.\n\nWithin the depletion region ($0 \\le x \\le W_d$), the depletion approximation assumes that the mobile carrier concentration is negligible. The space charge is dominated by the fixed, ionized acceptors. For a uniformly doped p-type silicon film with acceptor concentration $N_A$, the charge density is $\\rho(x) = -q N_A$.\n\nPoisson's equation is thus:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_{si}} = \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{si}$ is the permittivity of silicon.\n\nWe solve this second-order ordinary differential equation by integrating it twice, using appropriate boundary conditions. The boundary conditions are defined relative to the neutral region beyond the depletion edge.\n1.  The electric field is zero at the edge of the depletion region: $E(W_d) = -\\left.\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\right|_{x=W_d} = 0$.\n2.  The potential is zero at the edge of the depletion region: $\\psi(W_d) = 0$.\n3.  The potential at the silicon surface ($x=0$) is the surface potential, $\\psi(0) = \\psi_s$.\n\nFirst integration of Poisson's equation from $x$ to $W_d$ yields the electric field $E(x) = -\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}$:\n$$ \\int_x^{W_d} \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx'^2} dx' = \\int_x^{W_d} \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}} dx' $$\n$$ \\left.\\frac{d\\psi}{dx'}\\right|_{x=W_d} - \\left.\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\right|_{x} = \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}} (W_d - x) $$\n$$ 0 - \\frac{d\\psi}{dx} = \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}} (W_d - x) $$\n$$ E(x) = -\\frac{d\\psi}{dx} = \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}} (x - W_d) $$\n\nSecond integration from $x=0$ to $x=W_d$ yields the potential $\\psi(x)$:\n$$ \\int_0^{W_d} \\frac{d\\psi}{dx'} dx' = \\int_0^{W_d} \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}} (W_d - x') dx' $$\n$$ \\psi(W_d) - \\psi(0) = \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}} \\left[ W_d x' - \\frac{x'^2}{2} \\right]_0^{W_d} $$\nSubstituting the boundary conditions $\\psi(W_d)=0$ and $\\psi(0)=\\psi_s$:\n$$ 0 - \\psi_s = \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}} \\left( W_d^2 - \\frac{W_d^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{q N_A W_d^2}{2 \\varepsilon_{si}} $$\nThis gives the relationship between the surface potential and the depletion width:\n$$ \\psi_s = \\frac{q N_A W_d^2}{2 \\varepsilon_{si}} $$\nSolving for the depletion width $W_d$:\n$$ W_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{si} \\psi_s}{q N_A}} $$\nThe problem defines the threshold condition by the surface potential being twice the Fermi potential, $\\psi_s = 2 \\phi_F$. Substituting this into the expression for $W_d$ gives the depletion width at threshold:\n$$ W_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{si} (2 \\phi_F)}{q N_A}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 \\varepsilon_{si} \\phi_F}{q N_A}} $$\nThis expression is valid provided that the calculated $W_d$ is less than the silicon film thickness $t_{si}$.\n\n### Step 2: Numerical Calculation\n\nFirst, we calculate the Fermi potential $\\phi_F$.\nThe thermal voltage $V_T$ is given by:\n$$ V_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nThe Fermi potential $\\phi_F$ is:\n$$ \\phi_F = V_T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right) = (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\phi_F = (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\ln(5.0 \\times 10^7) \\approx (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times (17.7275) \\approx 0.45826\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nThe surface potential at threshold is:\n$$ \\psi_s = 2 \\phi_F \\approx 2 \\times 0.45826\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.91652\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nNow we can calculate the depletion width $W_d$.

This also validates our use of the depletion width formula, which assumes a bulk-like substrate (i.e., the depletion region is not constrained by the film thickness).",

The derivation of the maximum allowable silicon film thickness for a Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (FD-SOI) device will proceed by following the three parts outlined in the problem statement.\n\nPart $1$: Derivation of the electrostatic potential profile $\\psi(x)$.\nWe begin with the one-dimensional Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential $\\psi(x)$ within the silicon film:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_{si}} $$\nHere, $\\rho(x)$ is the space charge density and $\\varepsilon_{si}$ is the permittivity of silicon. The coordinate $x$ is defined with $x=0$ at the front gate-oxide/silicon interface and $x=t_{si}$ at the back silicon/buried-oxide interface.\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the depletion approximation for a uniformly doped $p$-type semiconductor. In this approximation, the region is depleted of mobile charge carriers (holes), leaving a fixed negative space charge density from the ionized acceptor atoms. For a fully depleted film of thickness $t_{si}$, the charge density is constant throughout the film ($0 \\le x \\le t_{si}$):\n$$ \\rho(x) = -qN_A $$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge and $N_A$ is the acceptor concentration.\n\nSubstituting the charge density into Poisson's equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}} $$\nIntegrating this equation once with respect to $x$ gives the gradient of the potential, which is the negative of the electric field, $\\mathcal{E}(x) = -d\\psi/dx$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx} = \\int \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}} dx = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}}x + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is an integration constant. We apply the first boundary condition, which states that the electric field is zero at the back interface, $\\mathcal{E}(t_{si})=0$.\n$$ \\mathcal{E}(t_{si}) = -\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=t_{si}} = -\\left(\\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}}t_{si} + C_1\\right) = 0 $$\nFrom this, we find $C_1 = -\\frac{qN_A t_{si}}{\\varepsilon_{si}}$. Substituting $C_1$ back, we get:\n$$ \\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx} = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}}(x - t_{si}) $$\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $x$ yields the potential profile $\\psi(x)$:\n$$ \\psi(x) = \\int \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}}(x - t_{si}) dx = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\varepsilon_{si}}(x - t_{si})^2 + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second integration constant.

The depletion region has a width $W_d$, extending from the surface at $x=0$ to $x=W_d$.

The solution for the potential profile is mathematically identical to that of Part $1$, with $t_{si}$ replaced by $W_d$:\n$$ \\psi(x) = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\varepsilon_{si}}(x - W_d)^2 $$\nThe surface potential, $\\psi_s$, is the potential at the silicon surface, $x=0$:\n$$ \\psi_s = \\psi(0) = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\varepsilon_{si}}(0 - W_d)^2 = \\frac{qN_A W_d^2}{2\\varepsilon_{si}} $$\nThis equation relates the depletion width $W_d$ to the surface potential $\\psi_s$. We can express $W_d$ in terms of $\\psi_s$:\n$$ W_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_{si}\\psi_s}{qN_A}} $$\nThe onset of strong inversion is defined by the condition that the surface potential reaches $\\psi_s = 2\\phi_F$, where $\\phi_F$ is the Fermi potential of the $p$-type silicon. Substituting this value into the expression for $W_d$ gives the depletion width at strong inversion:\n$$ W_d(\\psi_s = 2\\phi_F) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_{si}(2\\phi_F)}{qN_A}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\varepsilon_{si}\\phi_F}{qN_A}} $$\nThis is the maximum depletion width, let's call it $W_{d,max}$, that can form in a bulk MOS device. Beyond this point, an inversion layer forms and shields the bulk from further increases in the gate field.\n\nPart $3$: Derivation of the maximum allowable silicon film thickness $t_{si,max}$.\nAn SOI device is classified as fully depleted (FD) if its silicon film is thin enough to be entirely depleted of mobile carriers before a strong inversion layer forms at the front interface. If the film is too thick, strong inversion will occur while a neutral region still exists at the back of the film; this is a partially depleted (PD) device.\n\nThe condition for a device to be properly categorized as FD-SOI is that its thickness, $t_{si}$, must be less than or equal to the maximum possible depletion width, $W_{d,max}$, that can be sustained in silicon at the onset of strong inversion.\n$$ t_{si} \\le W_{d,max} $$\nIf $t_{si} > W_{d,max}$, the device will reach strong inversion ($\\psi_s = 2\\phi_F$) when the depletion width is $W_{d,max}$, leaving a neutral region of thickness $t_{si} - W_{d,max}$ at the back. This would be a PD-SOI device.\nTherefore, the maximum allowable silicon film thickness for a device to be considered fully depleted, $t_{si,max}$, corresponds to the equality:\n$$ t_{si,max} = W_{d,max} $$\nUsing the result from Part $2$ for $W_{d,max}$:\n$$ t_{si,max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\varepsilon_{si}\\phi_F}{qN_A}} $$\nThis expression represents the upper limit on the silicon film thickness to ensure fully depleted operation up to the threshold of strong inversion.",

The conduction band edge shift is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta E_c = E_{1,l} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 m_l L^2}\n$$\nThe problem states that this energy shift leads to an increase in the threshold voltage $\\Delta V_T$, given by the relation:\n$$\n\\Delta V_T = \\frac{\\Delta E_c}{q} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 q m_l L^2}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values to calculate $\\Delta V_T$:\n- Silicon film thickness: $L=5.0\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Longitudinal effective mass: $m_{l}=0.916\\,m_{0}$\n- Electron rest mass: $m_{0}=9.1093837015\\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Reduced Planck constant: $\\hbar=1.054571817\\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}$\n- Elementary charge: $q=1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of $m_l$ in SI units:\n$$\nm_l = 0.916 \\times (9.1093837015\\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) \\approx 8.34419547 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}\n$$\nNext, we substitute all values into the expression for $\\Delta V_T$:\n$$\n\\Delta V_T = \\frac{\\pi^2 (1.054571817\\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s})^2}{2 (1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) (0.916 \\times 9.1093837015\\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) (5.0\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}\n$$\nLet's evaluate the expression.\nThe numerator is:\n$$\n\\pi^2 \\hbar^2 \\approx (9.86960440) \\times (1.054571817\\times 10^{-34})^2 \\,\\mathrm{J}^2\\mathrm{s}^2 \\approx 1.09756 \\times 10^{-67}\\,\\mathrm{J}^2\\mathrm{s}^2\n$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$\n2 q m_l L^2 = 2 \\times (1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}) \\times (8.34419547 \\times 10^{-31}) \\times (5.0\\times 10^{-9})^2 \\,\\mathrm{C \\cdot kg \\cdot m^2}\n$$\n$$\n2 q m_l L^2 \\approx 6.685382 \\times 10^{-65}\\,\\mathrm{C \\cdot kg \\cdot m^2}\n$$\nNow, we compute the ratio. The units are $\\mathrm{J^2 s^2} / (\\mathrm{C \\cdot kg \\cdot m^2}) = (\\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2 \\cdot s^{-2}})^2 \\mathrm{s^2} / (\\mathrm{C \\cdot kg \\cdot m^2}) = \\mathrm{kg^2 m^4 s^{-2}} / (\\mathrm{C \\cdot kg \\cdot m^2}) = \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2 \\cdot s^{-2}} / \\mathrm{C} = \\mathrm{J/C} = \\mathrm{V}$.\n$$\n\\Delta V_T = \\frac{1.09756 \\times 10^{-67}}{6.685382 \\times 10^{-65}} \\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta V_T \\approx 0.016417109 \\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta V_T \\approx 0.01642 \\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$",
