            "solution": "The user wants me to solve a problem about corner effects in a FinFET.\n\n**1. Problem Validation**\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement according to the required protocol.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n-   **Device:** Tri-gate Fin Field-Effect Transistor (FinFET).\n-   **Geometry:** The gate wraps the fin on the top and two sidewalls.\n-   **Fin Dimensions:** Top width is $W$, sidewall height is $H$.\n-   **Corner Effect:** Electrostatic focusing at the two top corners enhances surface potential and inversion charge density.\n-   **Characteristic Decay Length, $R$:** The arc-length along the gate-controlled perimeter over which the surface potential decays to $1/\\exp(1)$ of its corner value.\n-   **Assumption 1:** The total gate-controlled perimeter length is the sum of the top width and twice the fin height.\n-   **Assumption 2:** The \"corner-influenced perimeter\" is the subset of the gate-controlled perimeter for which the shortest arc-length to either of the two top corners is less than or equal to $R$.\n-   **Assumption 3:** The characteristic length satisfies $R \\ll W$ and $R \\ll H$.\n-   **Task:** Derive closed-form expressions for:\n    1.

The concept of corner enhancement in multi-gate transistors like FinFETs is a well-established phenomenon in nanoelectronics. The description of electrostatic focusing, enhanced potential, and inversion charge is physically correct. Modeling this with a characteristic decay length $R$ derived from the underlying Poisson-Laplace equations is a standard and valid simplification for analytical treatment.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. The geometry, perimeters, and the concept of the \"influenced\" region are clearly and unambiguously defined.

The assumptions are consistent with the problem's context and with each other.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined, scientifically sound problem in semiconductor device physics that can be solved using the provided definitions and assumptions. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n**2. Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution requires calculating two quantities: the total length of the corner-influenced perimeter, and the fraction this length represents of the total gate-controlled perimeter.\n\n**Total Gate-Controlled Perimeter ($L_{total}$)**\nBased on the first assumption, the total gate-controlled perimeter, which we denote as $L_{total}$, is the sum of the fin's top width and the heights of the two sidewalls.\n$$L_{total} = W + 2H$$\n\n**Corner-Influenced Perimeter Length ($L_{inf}$)**\nThe problem defines the corner-influenced perimeter as the region where the arc-length distance to the nearest of the two top corners is less than or equal to $R$. Let us analyze the geometry. The FinFET has two top corners where the top surface meets the two vertical sidewalls.\n\nConsider a single corner. The \"influenced\" region extends along the perimeter in both directions away from the corner. Specifically, it extends a distance $R$ along the top surface and a distance $R$ down the sidewall. Therefore, the total length of the perimeter influenced by a single corner is $R + R = 2R$.\n\nThere are two such corners. The total influenced perimeter, $L_{inf}$, is the length of the union of the regions influenced by each corner. We must consider if these regions overlap.\nThe region influenced by the first corner includes a segment of length $R$ on the top surface. The region influenced by the second corner also includes a segment of length $R$ on the top surface, extending from the other end. The distance between the two corners along the top surface is $W$.\nThe total extent of the influenced regions on the top surface would be $R+R = 2R$ if they did not overlap. Overlap would occur if $2R > W$. However, the problem explicitly assumes $R \\ll W$, which implies $2R  W$. Therefore, the two influenced regions on the top surface are distinct and do not overlap.\n\nThe other parts of the influenced regions are on the two separate sidewalls. A length $R$ on one sidewall and a length $R$ on the other sidewall. These cannot overlap. The assumption $R \\ll H$ ensures that the influenced region on each sidewall does not extend to the bottom of the fin.\n\nSince there is no overlap between the regions influenced by the two corners, the total influenced length $L_{inf}$ is simply the sum of the lengths of the regions influenced by each corner.\n$$L_{inf} = (\\text{length from corner 1}) + (\\text{length from corner 2})$$\n$$L_{inf} = (2R) + (2R) = 4R$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\n**Fraction of Corner-Influenced Perimeter ($f$)**\nThe second task is to find the fraction, $f$, of the gate-controlled perimeter that is corner-influenced. This is the ratio of the influenced length to the total length.\n$$f = \\frac{L_{inf}}{L_{total}} = \\frac{4R}{W + 2H}$$\nThe problem requires this fraction to be expressed in a form that makes its scaling with the ratios $R/W$ and $R/H$ explicit. To achieve this, we can express the total fraction as a weighted sum of the fractional influences on the top and side surfaces.\n\nThe total influenced length $L_{inf} = 4R$ can be seen as the sum of the influenced length on the top surface ($2R$) and the influenced length on the sidewalls (summing to $2R$).\n$$f = \\frac{2R + 2R}{W + 2H}$$\nWe can rewrite this expression by separating the contributions from the top and the sides:\n$$f = \\frac{2R}{W + 2H} + \\frac{2R}{W + 2H}$$\nTo reveal the scaling with $R/W$ and $R/H$, we can multiply the first term by $W/W$ and the second by $2H/(2H)$:\n$$f = \\left(\\frac{W}{W + 2H}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2R}{W}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2H}{W + 2H}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2R}{2H}\\right)$$\nSimplifying the second term's second bracket gives:\n$$f = \\left(\\frac{W}{W + 2H}\\right)\\left(2\\frac{R}{W}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2H}{W + 2H}\\right)\\left(\\frac{R}{H}\\right)$$\nThis form is instructive. The term $\\frac{W}{W+2H}$ is the fraction of the total perimeter corresponding to the top surface, and $2\\frac{R}{W}$ is the fraction of that top surface that is corner-influenced. Similarly, $\\frac{2H}{W+2H}$ is the fraction of the perimeter on the sidewalls, and $\\frac{R}{H}$ is the fraction of that sidewall perimeter that is influenced. The expression thus represents the total influenced fraction as a weighted average of the influenced fractions of the constituent geometric parts, making the scaling with $R/W$ and $R/H$ explicit as requested.\n\nAlthough this form provides physical insight, the most algebraically simplified closed-form expression remains:\n$$f = \\frac{4R}{W + 2H}$$\nFor the final answer, the most reduced form is mathematically standard.\n\nThe final results are:\n1.  Effective corner-influenced perimeter length: $4R$.\n2.  Fraction of the gate-controlled perimeter that is corner-influenced: $\\frac{4R}{W + 2H}$.",

This is not a contradiction but a modeling choice, and all necessary information for a unique solution is provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the effective oxide capacitance per unit gate length, $C_{\\text{ox,eff}}$. The problem provides the definition of this quantity as the perimeter-average of the local capacitance per unit gate length, $c_{\\text{local}}(s)$:\n$$C_{\\text{ox,eff}} = \\frac{1}{P} \\int_{\\Gamma} c_{\\text{local}}(s) \\,\\mathrm{d}s$$\nHere, $\\Gamma$ represents the entire gate-channel interface perimeter, and $P$ is the normalization factor, given as $P = W + 2H$.\n\nThe integral is taken over the perimeter $\\Gamma$, which consists of three distinct types of segments: the planar top surface, the two planar sidewalls, and the two rounded top corners.

            "problem": "Consider a fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) implemented as a multi-gate metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), where the gate wraps the fin on multiple sides. At convex fin corners, electrostatic field crowding enhances gate coupling relative to flat regions, leading to a lower threshold voltage at the corners and thereby an overall shift of the device threshold. Working from first principles, derive an additive compact model term to augment a standard multi-gate threshold voltage model that accounts for this corner-induced shift.\n\nUse the following physically grounded bases:\n- Maxwell’s equations in electrostatics, in particular Gauss’s law, and the fact that in a linear dielectric the displacement field is given by $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}$.\n- The threshold condition defined by the onset of strong inversion, i.e., the surface potential reaching $2 \\phi_{F}$, with a corresponding required inversion charge $Q_{\\text{inv,th}}$ obtained from charge balance.\n- The relationship between gate voltage and inversion charge through a capacitance, $Q = C \\cdot V$, with $C$ determined by the oxide geometry at the semiconductor interface.\n\nModel the oxide near a corner as a curved dielectric layer. For a first-order small-curvature approximation, treat the oxide in the corner region locally as a cylindrical shell of inner radius $R_{\\text{c}}$ and thickness $t_{\\text{ox}}$ and use electrostatics to obtain a leading-order correction to the gate coupling relative to a locally planar oxide.

            "solution": "The problem asks for two main tasks. First, to derive from first principles a physically-grounded justification for the compact model form of the corner-induced threshold voltage shift in a FinFET, $\\Delta V_{th,\\text{corner}} \\propto \\frac{t_{\\text{ox}}}{R_{\\text{c}}}$. Second, to calibrate the proportionality constant $\\alpha$ in the specific model $\\Delta V_{th,\\text{corner}} = -\\alpha \\frac{t_{\\text{ox}}}{R_{\\text{c}}}$ using provided Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) data.\n\nThe derivation begins with the electrostatics of the gate-oxide-semiconductor system. The threshold voltage, $V_{th}$, is given by the sum of the flat-band voltage $V_{fb}$, the surface potential required for strong inversion ($2\\phi_F$), and the voltage drop across the gate oxide $V_{ox}$:\n$$\nV_{th} = V_{fb} + 2\\phi_F + V_{ox,th}\n$$\nAt threshold, the voltage drop $V_{ox,th}$ is that required to support the total charge in the semiconductor, which consists of the depletion charge density $Q'_{\\text{dep}}$ and the inversion charge density at threshold $Q'_{\\text{inv,th}}$. We denote the total charge density per unit area as $Q'_{\\text{total,th}} = Q'_{\\text{dep}} + Q'_{\\text{inv,th}}$. Assuming the charge is negative (for an n-channel MOSFET), we have $V_{ox,th} = -Q'_{\\text{total,th}}/C'_{\\text{ox}}$, where $C'_{\\text{ox}}$ is the oxide capacitance per unit area. For simplicity in the derivation, we will treat $Q'_{\\text{total,th}}$ as a positive quantity representing the magnitude of the charge, such that $V_{ox,th} = |Q'_{\\text{total,th}}|/C'_{\\text{ox}}$. The shift in threshold voltage between a corner region and a planar region arises from the difference in the oxide capacitance due to geometry. Assuming $V_{fb}$, $\\phi_F$, and $Q'_{\\text{total,th}}$ are approximately the same in both regions, the local threshold voltage shift is:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{th, \\text{local}} = V_{th, \\text{corner}} - V_{th, \\text{planar}} = V_{ox,th, \\text{corner}} - V_{ox,th, \\text{planar}}\n$$\n\nFor a planar region, the oxide is a parallel-plate capacitor.

We use Gauss's law in cylindrical coordinates. The electric field at a distance $r$ from the center of curvature is $E(r) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}r}$, where $\\lambda$ is the charge per unit length along the fin axis.

We use the Taylor series expansion for $\\ln(1+x)$ around $x=0$, which is $\\ln(1+x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + O(x^3)$.\n$$\n\\Delta V_{th, \\text{local}} \\approx \\frac{|Q'_{\\text{total,th}}|}{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}} \\left[ R_{\\text{c}} \\left(\\frac{t_{\\text{ox}}}{R_{\\text{c}}} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{t_{\\text{ox}}}{R_{\\text{c}}}\\right)^2\\right) - t_{\\text{ox}} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta V_{th, \\text{local}} \\approx \\frac{|Q'_{\\text{total,th}}|}{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}} \\left[ t_{\\text{ox}} - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{t_{\\text{ox}}^2}{R_{\\text{c}}} - t_{\\text{ox}} \\right] = -\\frac{|Q'_{\\text{total,th}}| t_{\\text{ox}}^2}{2\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}} R_{\\text{c}}}\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to highlight the dependence on $t_{\\text{ox}}/R_{\\text{c}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{th, \\text{local}} = -\\left(\\frac{|Q'_{\\text{total,th}}| t_{\\text{ox}}}{2\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}}\\right) \\frac{t_{\\text{ox}}}{R_{\\text{c}}}\n$$\nThis result shows that the local threshold voltage shift at the corner is negative (i.e., a reduction in $V_{th}$) and is proportional to the dimensionless parameter $t_{\\text{ox}}/R_{\\text{c}}$. The overall shift for the device, $\\Delta V_{th, \\text{corner}}$, will be this local shift weighted by a geometric factor representing the contribution of the corners to the total channel perimeter. This justifies the model form $\\Delta V_{th, \\text{corner}} \\propto \\frac{t_{\\text{ox}}}{R_{\\text{c}}}$.\n\nNow, we proceed to the calibration of the model parameter $\\alpha$ using the provided TCAD data. The model is given as:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{th,\\text{corner}} = -\\alpha \\frac{t_{\\text{ox}}}{R_{\\text{c}}}\n$$\nThis is a linear model passing through the origin. Let $y = \\Delta V_{th,\\text{corner}}$ and $x = \\frac{t_{\\text{ox}}}{R_{\\text{c}}}$. The model becomes $y = mx$, where the slope is $m = -\\alpha$. We are given $t_{\\text{ox}} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and three data points $(R_{\\text{c}i}, y_i)$. We first compute the values for the predictor variable $x_i$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $i=1$: $R_{\\text{c}1} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $y_1 = -0.058\\,\\mathrm{V}$. So, $x_1 = \\frac{1.2\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{1.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 0.8$.\n    \\item For $i=2$: $R_{\\text{c}2} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $y_2 = -0.031\\,\\mathrm{V}$. So, $x_2 = \\frac{1.2\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{3.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 0.4$.\n    \\item For $i=3$: $R_{\\text{c}3} = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $y_3 = -0.014\\,\\mathrm{V}$. So, $x_3 = \\frac{1.2\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{6.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 0.2$.\n\\end{itemize}\nOur data points for the linear regression are $(0.8, -0.058)$, $(0.4, -0.031)$, and $(0.2, -0.014)$.\n\nTo find the slope $m$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, $S(m) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3}(y_i - mx_i)^2$, for a regression through the origin, we use the formula:\n$$\nm = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i^2}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the sum of squares of $x_i$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i^2 = (0.8)^2 + (0.4)^2 + (0.2)^2 = 0.64 + 0.16 + 0.04 = 0.84\n$$\nNext, we calculate the sum of the products $x_i y_i$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i y_i = (0.8)(-0.058\\,\\mathrm{V}) + (0.4)(-0.031\\,\\mathrm{V}) + (0.2)(-0.014\\,\\mathrm{V})\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i y_i = -0.0464\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.0124\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.0028\\,\\mathrm{V} = -0.0616\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the slope $m$:\n$$\nm = \\frac{-0.0616\\,\\mathrm{V}}{0.84} \\approx -0.073333... \\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe parameter $\\alpha$ is related to the slope by $\\alpha = -m$.\n$$\n\\alpha = -(-0.073333... \\,\\mathrm{V}) = 0.073333... \\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx 0.07333\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$",
