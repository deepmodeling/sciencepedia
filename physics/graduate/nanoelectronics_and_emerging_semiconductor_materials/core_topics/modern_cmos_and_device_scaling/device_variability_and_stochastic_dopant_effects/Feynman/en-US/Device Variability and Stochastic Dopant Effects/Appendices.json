            "problem": "A nanoscale metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) with a planar gate is operated at room temperature. Consider the onset of strong inversion in a long-channel device formed on a uniformly doped, $p$-type silicon substrate. Device-to-device threshold voltage variability arises from Random Dopant Fluctuations (RDF) in the depletion region beneath the gate. Assume the following:\n\n- The gate oxide is silicon dioxide with dielectric permittivity $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 3.9 \\, \\varepsilon_{0}$, where $\\varepsilon_{0} = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{F/m}$.\n- The oxide thickness is $t_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n- The gate has length $L_{\\mathrm{g}} = 20 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and width $W_{\\mathrm{g}} = 20 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n- The elementary charge is $q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}$.\n- The metal gate work function is fixed such that the flatband voltage is independent of the substrate doping, and quantum confinement or interface trap effects are negligible.\n- The threshold condition is defined by a surface potential equal to twice the Fermi potential, and the depletion approximation holds; however, for the purpose of computing the incremental sensitivity to a single dopant, you may treat the added ionized dopant as an additional point charge located anywhere within the depletion region so that its entire electric field lines terminate on the gate (one-dimensional coupling).\n\nStarting from Gauss’s law and classical electrostatics, derive the expression for the incremental threshold voltage change $\\Delta V_{T}$ required to compensate the addition of one extra ionized acceptor in the depletion region under the gate at threshold. Then, using the device parameters above, compute the numerical value of $\\Delta V_{T}$. Round your final answer to four significant figures. Express the final answer in volts (V).",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the incremental threshold voltage change, $\\Delta V_{T}$, in a MOSFET due to the presence of a single additional ionized acceptor atom in the depletion region.\n\nThe validation process confirms that the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The assumptions provided, particularly the simplified electrostatic coupling model, allow for a direct and formalizable solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying fundamental principles of electrostatics to the simplified model of the device as specified.\n\nAn extra ionized acceptor atom in the p-type silicon substrate contributes a localized, fixed negative charge of magnitude $q$, where $q$ is the elementary charge. The problem states that for the purpose of this calculation, we are to assume that all electric field lines originating from this charge terminate on the metal gate. This is a one-dimensional coupling model.\n\nBy Gauss's law, if a charge of $-q$ is placed in the depletion region, and its field lines terminate exclusively on the gate conductor, an equal and opposite charge must be induced on the surface of the gate. Therefore, the addition of the single dopant induces an additional positive charge, $\\Delta Q_{G}$, on the gate, where:\n$$ \\Delta Q_{G} = q $$\n\nThe gate, oxide, and semiconductor form a capacitor. The change in charge on the gate, $\\Delta Q_{G}$, is related to a change in the gate voltage, $\\Delta V_{G}$, by the gate capacitance, $C_{g}$.\n$$ \\Delta Q_{G} = C_{g} \\Delta V_{G} $$\n\nThe threshold voltage, $V_T$, is the specific gate voltage that establishes the onset of strong inversion. The change in gate voltage required to counteract the effect of the added dopant and restore the threshold condition is the threshold voltage shift, $\\Delta V_T$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$ \\Delta Q_{G} = C_{g} \\Delta V_{T} $$\n\nCombining the equations, we find the relationship for the threshold voltage shift:\n$$ q = C_{g} \\Delta V_{T} $$\nSolving for $\\Delta V_T$ yields:\n$$ \\Delta V_{T} = \\frac{q}{C_{g}} $$\nA positive value for $\\Delta V_T$ indicates that the threshold voltage increases, which is consistent with the need for a more positive gate voltage to compensate for the additional negative charge in the depletion region.\n\nThe next step is to find an expression for the gate capacitance, $C_g$. The problem describes a planar gate structure. We can model the gate-oxide-semiconductor system as a parallel-plate capacitor. The capacitance is given by:\n$$ C_{g} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} A_{g}}{t_{\\mathrm{ox}}} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ is the dielectric permittivity of the gate oxide, $A_g$ is the area of the gate, and $t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ is the oxide thickness.\n\nThe gate area $A_g$ is the product of the gate length $L_g$ and gate width $W_g$:\n$$ A_g = L_g W_g $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_g$ and $A_g$ into the equation for $\\Delta V_T$, we obtain the final symbolic expression:\n$$ \\Delta V_{T} = \\frac{q t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} L_g W_g} $$\nThe permittivity of the oxide is given as $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 3.9 \\, \\varepsilon_{0}$.

Subtracting equation $(1)$ from equation $(2)$:\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},2} - \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},1} = K (t_{\\mathrm{ox},2}^2 - t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2) $$\nSolving for $K$:\n$$ K = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},2} - \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},1}}{t_{\\mathrm{ox},2}^2 - t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $K$ back into equation $(1)$:\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},1} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},2} - \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},1}}{t_{\\mathrm{ox},2}^2 - t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2}\\right) t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2 + \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{other}} $$\nSolving for $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{other}}$ gives the required expression:\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{other}} = \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},1} - \\frac{(\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},2} - \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},1}) t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2}{t_{\\mathrm{ox},2}^2 - t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2} $$\nCombining the terms by finding a common denominator:\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{other}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},1}(t_{\\mathrm{ox},2}^2 - t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2) - (\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},2} - \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},1}) t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2}{t_{\\mathrm{ox},2}^2 - t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{other}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},1} t_{\\mathrm{ox},2}^2 - \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},1} t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2 - \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},2} t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2 + \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},1} t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2}{t_{\\mathrm{ox},2}^2 - t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2} $$\nThe final derived expression is:\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{other}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},1} t_{\\mathrm{ox},2}^2 - \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},2} t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2}{t_{\\mathrm{ox},2}^2 - t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2} $$\nWe can now compute the value of $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{other}}$ using the provided data. It is convenient to perform the calculation with the standard deviations expressed in millivolts ($\\mathrm{mV}$) and oxide thicknesses in nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$), as the units of thickness will cancel out.\n\nGiven values:\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot},1} = 12.63\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot},2} = 16.85\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n$t_{\\mathrm{ox},1} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n$t_{\\mathrm{ox},2} = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the variances and the squares of the oxide thicknesses:\n$\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},1} = (12.63)^2 = 159.5169\\,\\mathrm{mV}^2$\n$\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{tot},2} = (16.85)^2 = 283.9225\\,\\mathrm{mV}^2$\n$t_{\\mathrm{ox},1}^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2$\n$t_{\\mathrm{ox},2}^2 = (3.6)^2 = 12.96\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{other}}$:\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{other}} = \\frac{(159.5169\\,\\mathrm{mV}^2)(12.96\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2) - (283.9225\\,\\mathrm{mV}^2)(1.44\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2)}{12.96\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2 - 1.44\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{other}} = \\frac{2067.339024 - 408.8484}{11.52}\\,\\mathrm{mV}^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{other}} = \\frac{1658.490624}{11.52}\\,\\mathrm{mV}^2 \\approx 143.96620\\,\\mathrm{mV}^2 $$\nThe problem asks for the standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{other}} = \\sqrt{143.96620\\,\\mathrm{mV}^2} \\approx 11.99859\\,\\mathrm{mV} $$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures, we get $12.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.",
