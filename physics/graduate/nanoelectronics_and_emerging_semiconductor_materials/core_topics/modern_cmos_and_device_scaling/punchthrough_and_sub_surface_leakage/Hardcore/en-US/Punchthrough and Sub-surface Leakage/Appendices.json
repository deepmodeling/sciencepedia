The ground-state confinement energies are:\n$$E_{c,11} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{m_c^* W^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad E_{v,11} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{m_v^* W^2}$$\nUsing the given constants: $\\hbar = 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$, $m_0 = 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg}$, $W = 4 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}$, and $q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}$:\n$m_c^* = 0.19 \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg} = 1.7309 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg}$\n$m_v^* = 0.49 \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg} = 4.4639 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg}$\n$$E_{c,11} = \\frac{(1.054 \\times 10^{-34})^2 \\pi^2}{(1.7309 \\times 10^{-31}) (4 \\times 10^{-9})^2} \\approx 3.959 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$$\n$$E_{v,11} = \\frac{(1.054 \\times 10^{-34})^2 \\pi^2}{(4.4639 \\times 10^{-31}) (4 \\times 10^{-9})^2} \\approx 1.535 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$$\nConverting these energies to electron volts ($1 \\text{ eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$):\n$$E_{c,11} \\approx \\frac{3.959 \\times 10^{-20}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 0.2471 \\text{ eV}$$\n$$E_{v,11} \\approx \\frac{1.535 \\times 10^{-20}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 0.0958 \\text{ eV}$$\nThe effective bandgap in the confined structure, $E_{g,\\text{eff}}$, is the bulk bandgap $E_{g0}$ plus the sum of these confinement energies:\n$$E_{g,\\text{eff}} = E_{g0} + E_{c,11} + E_{v,11} = 1.12 \\text{ eV} + 0.2471 \\text{ eV} + 0.0958 \\text{ eV} = 1.4629 \\text{ eV}$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the built-in potentials. The built-in potential $V_{bi}$ of a p-n junction is given by:\n$$V_{bi} = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, $q$ is the elementary charge, $N_A$ and $N_D$ are the acceptor and donor concentrations, and $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration.\nThe thermal voltage at $T = 300 \\text{ K}$ is $V_T = k_B T / q \\approx 0.02587 \\text{ V}$.\nFor the bulk case, using $N_A = 5.0 \\times 10^{17} \\text{ cm}^{-3}$, $N_D = 5.0 \\times 10^{19} \\text{ cm}^{-3}$, and $n_{i0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ cm}^{-3}$:\n$$V_{bi,\\text{bulk}} = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{17})(5.0 \\times 10^{19})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{10})^2}\\right) = (0.02587 \\text{ V}) \\ln(2.5 \\times 10^{17}) \\approx 1.036 \\text{ V}$$\nThe intrinsic carrier concentration's dependence on the bandgap $E_g$ is described by $n_i^2 = N_C N_V \\exp(-E_g / k_B T)$, where $N_C$ and $N_V$ are the effective densities of states. Assuming $N_C$ and $N_V$ are unchanged by confinement, the ratio of the squared intrinsic carrier concentrations is:\n$$\\frac{n_{i,\\text{eff}}^2}{n_{i0}^2} = \\frac{\\exp(-E_{g,\\text{eff}} / k_B T)}{\\exp(-E_{g0} / k_B T)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{g,\\text{eff}} - E_{g0}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe built-in potential for the confined structure is:\n$$V_{bi,\\text{eff}} = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_{i,\\text{eff}}^2}\\right) = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_{i0}^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{g,\\text{eff}} - E_{g0}}{k_B T}\\right)}\\right)$$\n$$V_{bi,\\text{eff}} = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_{i0}^2}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{g,\\text{eff}} - E_{g0}}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) \\right]$$\n$$V_{bi,\\text{eff}} = V_{bi,\\text{bulk}} + \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\left(\\frac{E_{g,\\text{eff}} - E_{g0}}{k_B T}\\right) = V_{bi,\\text{bulk}} + \\frac{E_{g,\\text{eff}} - E_{g0}}{q}$$\nThe increase in the built-in potential is simply the increase in bandgap energy, expressed in volts.\n$$\\Delta V_{bi} = \\frac{E_{g,\\text{eff}} - E_{g0}}{q} = \\frac{E_{c,11} + E_{v,11}}{q} = 0.2471 \\text{ V} + 0.0958 \\text{ V} = 0.3429 \\text{ V}$$\n$$V_{bi,\\text{eff}} = 1.036 \\text{ V} + 0.3429 \\text{ V} = 1.3789 \\text{ V}$$\n\nFinally, we find the ratio of the depletion widths. Under the depletion approximation for an abrupt p-n junction, the total depletion width $W_{dep}$ is:\n$$W_{dep} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon_s}{q} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right) V_{bi}}$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_s$ is the permittivity of silicon. For fixed doping concentrations and material, all terms in the square root are constant except for the built-in potential $V_{bi}$. Therefore, the depletion width scales as $W_{dep} \\propto \\sqrt{V_{bi}}$. The ratio of the confined-junction depletion width ($W_{\\text{eff}}$) to the bulk-junction depletion width ($W_{\\text{bulk}}$) is:\n$$\\frac{W_{\\text{eff}}}{W_{\\text{bulk}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{V_{bi,\\text{eff}}}{V_{bi,\\text{bulk}}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for the built-in potentials:\n$$\\frac{W_{\\text{eff}}}{W_{\\text{bulk}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.3789}{1.036}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.3310} \\approx 1.15369$$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures, we get $1.15$.",
