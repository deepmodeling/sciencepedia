Consider two devices under identical bias in the oxide: a planar Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) with a gate overlapping the drain extension, and a Fin Field-Effect Transistor (FinFET) with a rectangular fin of width $W$ and height $H$, where the gate wraps around the top and side faces.

            "solution": "First, we determine the electric field magnitude for the planar MOSFET, $E_{\\mathrm{planar}}$, as requested in task 3. The gate-drain overlap region is approximated as locally one-dimensional. Let the coordinate normal to the interface be $z$. The Laplace equation in one dimension is $\\frac{d^{2}V}{dz^{2}} = 0$. The general solution is a linear potential, $V(z) = az+b$. Let the gate be at $z=0$ and the drain surface at $z=t_{\\mathrm{p}}$. The potential drop across the oxide is given as $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{p}}$. This drop is equal to $|V(t_{\\mathrm{p}}) - V(0)| = |(at_{\\mathrm{p}}+b) - (a\\cdot 0 + b)| = |a|t_{\\mathrm{p}}$. The electric field is the negative gradient of the potential, $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V$. In one dimension, the field magnitude is $E = |-\\frac{dV}{dz}| = |-a| = |a|$.

The planar-edge field magnitude is uniform in this model.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{planar}} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{p}}}{t_{\\mathrm{p}}}\n$$\nNext, we address tasks 1 and 2 concerning the FinFET corner. The problem directs us to model the local field near the corner as a superposition of two independent uniform fields. Let the coordinate system origin $(x,y)=(0,0)$ be at the silicon fin corner. Let $x$ be the coordinate normal to the top face and $y$ be the coordinate normal to the side face, such that the oxide fills the region $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.\n\nThe core assumption is that the total electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is the vector sum of two orthogonal, uniform fields: one generated by the top gate surface and one by the side gate surface.\nThe field component normal to the top face, $\\mathbf{E}_{x}$, has a magnitude determined by the potential drop $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{top}}$ across the oxide thickness $t_{\\mathrm{top}}$, analogous to the planar case.

This potential function satisfies the Laplace equation $\\nabla^{2}V = 0$.\n\nFor task 2, we find the magnitude of the field vector at the corner.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{corner}} = |\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{corner}}| = \\sqrt{E_{x}^{2} + E_{y}^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{top}}}{t_{\\mathrm{top}}}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{side}}}{t_{\\mathrm{side}}}\\right)^{2}}\n$$\nFinally, for task 4, we compute the ratio $E_{\\mathrm{corner}}/E_{\\mathrm{planar}}$ under the specified symmetric conditions: $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{top}}=\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{side}}=\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{p}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{top}}=t_{\\mathrm{side}}=t_{\\mathrm{p}}$. Let us denote the common potential drop as $\\Delta V$ and the common oxide thickness as $t$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the planar field magnitude is:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{planar}} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{t}\n$$\nAnd the corner field magnitude is:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{corner}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta V}{t}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta V}{t}\\right)^{2}} = \\sqrt{2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta V}{t}\\right)^{2}} = \\sqrt{2} \\left|\\frac{\\Delta V}{t}\\right|\n$$\nSince field magnitudes are non-negative, this simplifies to $E_{\\mathrm{corner}} = \\sqrt{2} \\frac{\\Delta V}{t}$.\n\nThe multiplicative increase, or ratio, is then:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{corner}}}{E_{\\mathrm{planar}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\frac{\\Delta V}{t}}{\\frac{\\Delta V}{t}} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nThis result quantifies the field enhancement at the corner of a FinFET compared to a planar device under identical bias and oxide thickness conditions, based on the given simplified model.

Gate-Induced Drain Leakage (GIDL) can arise due to band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) at the drain-side surface under a large negative gate bias, while impact ionization (II) can occur in the high-field pinch-off region under a large drain bias when the channel conducts. Starting from the governing electrostatics and carrier transport principles, analyze how high lateral electric fields near the drain can simultaneously enable BTBT and II, and then propose an experimental diagnostic using substrate current versus drain voltage to distinguish between these mechanisms.\n\nAssume the following physically consistent qualitative setup without invoking any specific compact-model formulas: a rectangular drain junction with a depletion region extending into the substrate on the drain side; a gate overlap that modulates the surface potential above the drain-side depletion edge; and a short channel such that the drain-induced barrier lowering is non-negligible under high drain bias.

Using Poisson’s equation and boundary conditions at the drain-substrate junction, explain why a large drain bias $V_{d}$ creates a high lateral field near the drain-side depletion edge, and how a sufficiently negative gate bias $V_{g}$ creates a high vertical field that bends the bands at the surface above the drain-side depletion region. Based on these fields, explain qualitatively how BTBT can occur at the surface under negative $V_{g}$ (GIDL), and how II can occur in the lateral high-field pinch-off region under large $V_{d}$ when the channel conducts.\n\n2. From the WKB perspective, argue why the BTBT current density $J_{\\text{BTBT}}$ at the surface is extremely sensitive to the vertical field $E_{\\perp}$ controlled by $V_{g}$ and has weak temperature dependence, while the II-generated substrate current $I_{\\text{sub}}^{\\text{II}}$ scales with the channel electron flux and depends on the lateral field $E_{\\parallel}$ controlled mainly by $V_{d}$ and the degree of pinch-off.\n\n3.

            "solution": "This problem requires analyzing the physical mechanisms of Gate-Induced Drain Leakage (GIDL) and Impact Ionization (II) to devise a reliable experimental method to distinguish them.\n\n**1. Physical Mechanisms of GIDL and II**\n\n*   **GIDL via Band-to-Band Tunneling (BTBT):** GIDL occurs in the \"off\" state ($V_g \\leq 0$ for an n-MOSFET) with a high drain voltage ($V_d > 0$). The large negative gate-to-drain voltage ($V_{gd} = V_g - V_d$) creates a very strong vertical electric field ($E_{\\perp}$) at the surface of the drain where it is overlapped by the gate. This field causes the energy bands in the silicon to bend severely, creating a thin potential barrier between the valence and conduction bands. Electrons from the valence band can then quantum-mechanically tunnel through this barrier into the conduction band, generating electron-hole pairs. The holes are injected into the substrate, forming the GIDL-related substrate current.\n*   **Impact Ionization (II):** This mechanism occurs in the \"on\" state ($V_g > V_T$) when the transistor is in saturation ($V_d > V_{g} - V_T$). Under these conditions, a channel current ($I_d$) of electrons flows from source to drain. Near the drain, a high lateral electric field ($E_{\\parallel}$) exists in the pinch-off region. Electrons from the channel are accelerated by this high field, gaining significant kinetic energy. If an electron gains enough energy (greater than the silicon bandgap), it can create a new electron-hole pair upon colliding with the lattice. The newly created hole is swept into the substrate, generating an impact-ionization-related substrate current.\n\n**2. Key Dependencies of BTBT and II**\n\n*   **BTBT (GIDL):** The tunneling probability is exponentially dependent on the barrier thickness, which is inversely proportional to the electric field. Thus, GIDL current is extremely sensitive to the vertical field $E_{\\perp}$, which is primarily controlled by $V_{gd}$. As a quantum tunneling process, it is not thermally activated and thus shows very weak temperature dependence (a slight increase with temperature due to bandgap narrowing). It does not require a channel current to exist.\n*   **Impact Ionization (II):** The rate of impact ionization depends on two factors: the flux of primary carriers (the drain current, $I_d$) and the probability that a carrier gains enough energy from the lateral field $E_{\\parallel}$ to cause ionization. The process has a strong negative temperature dependence: at higher temperatures, increased phonon scattering reduces the electron mean free path, making it harder to gain sufficient energy between collisions, thus decreasing the ionization rate. II is only possible when a channel current is flowing.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Proposed Diagnostics**\n\nBased on the physics above, we can evaluate the proposed methods for distinguishing the two mechanisms.\n\n*   **Option A:** This method systematically isolates the conditions for each mechanism. By setting $V_g \\ll 0$, the channel is off, so any substrate current must be from leakage like GIDL. Checking for weak temperature dependence confirms this. By setting $V_g > V_T$, the channel is on, enabling impact ionization. Checking for correlation with $I_d$ and a negative temperature dependence would confirm II. This approach uses the distinct gate bias and temperature dependencies of the two phenomena, making it a robust and physically sound diagnostic.\n\n*   **Option B:** This proposes a threshold based on a simplistic and physically incorrect relation $q V_{d}^{\\star} = E_{g}$. The macroscopic terminal voltage $V_d$ does not directly map to the microscopic bandgap energy in this way. Both phenomena are governed by local electric fields, which are complex functions of geometry and multiple biases. This method is invalid.\n\n*   **Option C:** This claims that BTBT current decreases with increasing $V_d$ at a fixed negative $V_g$. This is incorrect. Increasing $V_d$ makes $V_{gd}$ more negative, which *increases* the electric field and therefore exponentially *increases* the GIDL current. The premise of this option is wrong.\n\n*   **Option D:** This suggests fitting the current to overly simple mathematical functions. The actual dependencies on $V_d$ are more complex than simple power laws or exponentials, as they are mediated by the electric field, which itself is a non-linear function of the terminal voltages. This method ignores the much clearer distinguishing features of gate bias dependence and temperature dependence, making it less reliable than Option A.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A provides the most reliable experimental diagnostic because it leverages the fundamental differences in the required bias conditions (off-state vs. on-state) and the distinct temperature dependencies of BTBT and impact ionization. This allows for clear separation and identification of the dominant mechanism.",
