            "problem": "A Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) or a short-channel transistor in an emerging semiconductor channel is measured to obtain two transfer characteristics, drain current versus gate voltage, $I_{d}(V_{g})$, at drain biases $V_{d}=50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{d}=1\\,\\mathrm{V}$, under identical body bias and temperature. The goal is to extract Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) using the constant-current method. From first principles, in the subthreshold regime where transport is diffusion-dominated and the source-to-channel barrier height sets the current, the gate voltage controls the surface potential predominantly through the gate oxide capacitance while the drain can couple electrostatically into the channel and lower the source barrier. At a fixed subthreshold current, a change in $V_{d}$ that lowers the barrier must be compensated by a decrease in $V_{g}$ to keep the barrier height, and therefore $I_{d}$, constant.\n\nWhich choice below gives a scientifically rigorous and practically robust procedure to extract DIBL from the two $I_{d}(V_{g})$ curves using the constant-current method, and correctly justifies the choice of the reference current $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ in the subthreshold regime?\n\nA. Select a reference current $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ normalized to geometry (for example, per unit width $W$ or per active perimeter for multi-gate devices) that lies well within the diffusion-dominated subthreshold region where the semi-log $I_{d}$–$V_{g}$ curves at $V_{d}=50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{d}=1\\,\\mathrm{V}$ are parallel (same subthreshold swing within experimental tolerance), above the noise floor and below regimes influenced by gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) or trap-assisted tunneling at high $V_{d}$. From each curve, read the gate voltages $V_{g}^{\\mathrm{low}}$ and $V_{g}^{\\mathrm{high}}$ at which $I_{d}=I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ for $V_{d}=50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{d}=1\\,\\mathrm{V}$, respectively. Compute DIBL as a positive quantity via $\\mathrm{DIBL}=\\left(V_{g}^{\\mathrm{low}}-V_{g}^{\\mathrm{high}}\\right)/\\left(1\\,\\mathrm{V}-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\right)$ and report it in $\\mathrm{mV}/\\mathrm{V}$, ensuring the same temperature and body bias are maintained. Justify $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ in subthreshold so that the extraction reflects barrier control rather than series resistance, velocity saturation, or mobility effects present in strong inversion, and is not contact-limited (verified by geometry normalization and parallelism of semi-log slopes).\n\nB. Choose $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ at the peak transconductance region in strong inversion to maximize sensitivity, then for each $V_{d}$ linearly extrapolate $I_{d}$–$V_{g}$ to define a threshold voltage $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and compute $\\mathrm{DIBL}=\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}/\\Delta V_{d}$. Strong inversion is preferred because the on-current is larger and thus has better signal-to-noise.\n\nC. At a fixed gate voltage $V_{g}$ in subthreshold, compute $\\mathrm{DIBL}=\\left[\\ln I_{d}(V_{d}=1\\,\\mathrm{V})-\\ln I_{d}(V_{d}=50\\,\\mathrm{mV})\\right]/\\left(1\\,\\mathrm{V}-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\right)$, and pick $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ as the minimum measurable current to avoid self-heating. This captures the drain-control of the barrier via the current ratio.\n\nD. Select $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ in the subthreshold regime as in A, but compute $\\mathrm{DIBL}=\\left(V_{g}^{\\mathrm{high}}-V_{g}^{\\mathrm{low}}\\right)/\\left(1\\,\\mathrm{V}-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\right)$ so that a lower threshold at higher $V_{d}$ yields a negative DIBL; report the signed value to distinguish barrier lowering from barrier raising.\n\nE. Choose $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ just below the onset of strong inversion to avoid GIDL, and compute $\\mathrm{DIBL}$ from the difference of subthreshold swing values between $V_{d}=1\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $V_{d}=50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ divided by $\\Delta V_{d}$, since DIBL primarily alters the slope of $\\log I_{d}$ versus $V_{g}$ in subthreshold.",
            "solution": "The constant-current method for extracting the Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) parameter is based on the physics of subthreshold conduction. In this regime, the drain current $I_d$ depends exponentially on the barrier height, which is controlled by the gate voltage $V_g$. A simplified model is $I_d \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q(V_g - V_{th})}{n k_B T}\\right)$, where $V_{th}$ is the threshold voltage.\n\nDIBL causes the threshold voltage $V_{th}$ to decrease as the drain voltage $V_d$ increases. To measure this, we select a constant reference current $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ in the subthreshold region. According to the model, keeping $I_d$ constant means keeping the term $(V_g - V_{th})$ constant.\n\nLet's consider two measurements at a low drain bias $V_d^{\\mathrm{low}}$ and a high drain bias $V_d^{\\mathrm{high}}$. Let the gate voltages required to achieve $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ be $V_g^{\\mathrm{low}}$ and $V_g^{\\mathrm{high}}$, respectively.\nAt constant current:\n$$ V_g^{\\mathrm{low}} - V_{th}(V_d^{\\mathrm{low}}) = V_g^{\\mathrm{high}} - V_{th}(V_d^{\\mathrm{high}}) $$\nThe change in threshold voltage is therefore equal to the change in gate voltage:\n$$ \\Delta V_{th} = V_{th}(V_d^{\\mathrm{high}}) - V_{th}(V_d^{\\mathrm{low}}) = V_g^{\\mathrm{high}} - V_g^{\\mathrm{low}} $$\nThe DIBL parameter, $\\lambda$, is conventionally defined as a positive quantity representing the magnitude of the $V_{th}$ shift per unit of $V_d$:\n$$ \\lambda = -\\frac{\\Delta V_{th}}{\\Delta V_d} = - \\frac{V_g^{\\mathrm{high}} - V_g^{\\mathrm{low}}}{V_d^{\\mathrm{high}} - V_d^{\\mathrm{low}}} = \\frac{V_g^{\\mathrm{low}} - V_g^{\\mathrm{high}}}{V_d^{\\mathrm{high}} - V_d^{\\mathrm{low}}} $$\nSince a higher $V_d$ lowers the barrier, a lower $V_g$ is needed to maintain the same current, meaning $V_g^{\\mathrm{high}}  V_g^{\\mathrm{low}}$. Thus, the formula correctly yields a positive value for DIBL.\n\n- **Option A** correctly implements this method. It specifies the correct formula for DIBL, the standard positive sign convention, and the crucial conditions for selecting $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$: it must be in the subthreshold (diffusion-dominated) region, away from noise, and avoiding confounding effects like GIDL at high $V_d$ or series resistance and mobility degradation in strong inversion. The mention of parallel semi-log curves (constant subthreshold swing) confirms the validity of the method.\n\n- **Option B** is incorrect. It describes an extraction in strong inversion (the linear extrapolation method), where the physics are dominated by drift current, and the measurement is confounded by effects like velocity saturation, which are not part of the fundamental definition of DIBL.\n\n- **Option C** is incorrect. It describes a \"constant-gate-voltage\" method and calculates a quantity related to the change in drain conductance, not the threshold voltage shift. The formula is dimensionally incorrect for DIBL.\n\n- **Option D** is incorrect because it uses a non-standard sign convention. While mathematically equivalent in magnitude, reporting DIBL as a negative value is confusing and goes against industry and academic standards.\n\n- **Option E** is incorrect. It confuses DIBL, which is a horizontal shift of the $I_d$-$V_g$ curve, with a change in the subthreshold swing, which is a change in the slope of the curve. These are distinct short-channel effects.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only choice that provides a scientifically rigorous, practically robust, and conventionally correct procedure.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for two quantities related to Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) in a short-channel MOSFET. First, the DIBL coefficient, and second, the corresponding change in barrier height.\n\n**1. Quantification of Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL)**\n\nDIBL is a short-channel effect where the drain voltage affects the potential barrier between the source and the channel, thereby influencing the threshold voltage $V_T$. It is quantified as the magnitude of the threshold voltage shift per unit increase in drain-to-source voltage $V_D$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{DIBL} = -\\frac{dV_T}{dV_D}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the threshold voltage typically decreases as the drain voltage increases, and ensures the DIBL coefficient is a positive number.\n\nIn this problem, the threshold voltage is determined by the constant-current method, where $V_T$ is defined as the gate voltage $V_G$ at which the drain current reaches a specific value. The problem provides two such points:\n- At $V_{D,1} = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the threshold voltage is $V_{T,1} = V_{G,1} = 0.410\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n- At $V_{D,2} = 1.000\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the threshold voltage is $V_{T,2} = V_{G,2} = 0.292\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nWe can approximate the derivative with a finite difference calculation using the two given data points:\n$$\n\\text{DIBL} \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta V_T}{\\Delta V_D} = -\\frac{V_{T,2} - V_{T,1}}{V_{D,2} - V_{D,1}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta V_T = V_{G,2} - V_{G,1} = 0.292\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.410\\,\\mathrm{V} = -0.118\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta V_D = V_{D,2} - V_{D,1} = 1.000\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.050\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.950\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the DIBL value:\n$$\n\\text{DIBL} = -\\frac{-0.118\\,\\mathrm{V}}{0.950\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{0.118}{0.950}\\,\\mathrm{V/V} \\approx 0.12421\\,\\mathrm{V/V}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\mathrm{mV}/\\mathrm{V}$.\n$$\n\\text{DIBL} \\approx 0.12421\\,\\mathrm{V/V} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{1\\,\\mathrm{V}} = 124.21\\,\\mathrm{mV/V}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $124\\,\\mathrm{mV/V}$.\n\n**2. Estimation of Barrier Height Decrease**\n\nIn the subthreshold region, maintaining a constant current means the total source-channel energy barrier for electrons is also constant. This barrier is modulated by both the drain voltage and the gate voltage. When the drain voltage increases, it lowers the barrier. To keep the current constant, the gate voltage must be decreased to raise the barrier by an exactly equal amount.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the barrier lowering caused by the drain is equal to the magnitude of the barrier raising caused by the compensatory gate voltage change. The problem asks for this barrier decrease, which we can find from the gate voltage change.\n\nThe observed gate-voltage reduction is:\n$$\n|\\Delta V_G| = V_{G,1} - V_{G,2} = 0.410\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.292\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.118\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe change in potential energy, $\\Delta E$, for an electron (charge $-e$) due to a change in electric potential $\\Delta V$ is $\\Delta E = (-e)\\Delta V$. The magnitude of the energy barrier change due to the gate voltage reduction is:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_B| = e \\cdot |\\Delta V_G| = e \\cdot (0.118\\,\\mathrm{V})\n$$\nWhen an energy change is expressed in units of electron-volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$), its numerical value is equal to the magnitude of the potential difference in volts through which the elementary charge moves. Thus, the magnitude of the barrier energy change is:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_B| = 0.118\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThis is the amount of barrier lowering caused by the increase in drain voltage. The result is already given to three significant figures.",
