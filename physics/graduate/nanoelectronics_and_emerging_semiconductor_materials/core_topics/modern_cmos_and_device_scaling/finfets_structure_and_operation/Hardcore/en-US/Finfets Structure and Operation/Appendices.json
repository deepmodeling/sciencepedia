            "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the threshold voltage, $V_T$, of an undoped silicon n-channel FinFET. The threshold voltage is defined as the gate voltage at which the lowest quantized energy subband in the fin becomes energetically aligned with the Fermi level of the intrinsic silicon.\n\nThe gate voltage, $V_G$, is related to the flat-band voltage, $V_{FB}$, the surface potential, $\\phi_s$, and the voltage drop across the gate oxide, $V_{ox}$, by the fundamental equation of a MOS capacitor:\n$$V_G = V_{FB} + \\phi_s + V_{ox}$$\nThe voltage drop across the oxide is caused by the charge in the semiconductor, $Q_{semi}$, such that $V_{ox} = Q_{semi} / C_{ox}$, where $C_{ox}$ is the oxide capacitance per unit area. In this problem, the silicon body is intrinsic (undoped), so there is no depletion charge. The threshold condition is defined as the point where the first subband just becomes accessible, implying the inversion charge density is negligible at this precise point ($Q_{semi} \\approx 0$). The problem also specifies to neglect quantum capacitance. Under these conditions, the voltage drop across the oxide at threshold is zero, $V_{ox}(V_T) \\approx 0$.\nThus, the threshold voltage is given by:\n$$V_T = V_{FB} + \\phi_s(V_T)$$\nwhere $\\phi_s(V_T)$ is the surface potential at threshold.

The derivation will begin from the fundamental principle of drift current and utilize the given approximations and equations.\n\nThe drain current $I_{D}$ in an n-channel transistor is due to the drift of electrons from the source to the drain. In the gradual channel approximation, the current at any point $x$ along the channel (from source at $x=0$ to drain at $x=L$) is given by the product of the magnitude of the mobile inversion charge per unit length, $|Q'_{\\mathrm{inv}}(x)|$, and the average electron drift velocity in the direction of the channel, $v_{n}(x)$.\n$$\nI_{D} = |Q'_{\\mathrm{inv}}(x)| v_{n}(x)\n$$\nFor an n-type channel in strong inversion ($V_{G} > V_{T}$), the mobile carriers are electrons, and the given expression for the charge per unit length, $Q'_{\\mathrm{inv}}(x)$, is positive.

Electrons, having negative charge, move against the electric field. The conventional current flows in the direction of the electric field. The electric field is the negative gradient of the electric potential, $E_{x}(x) = -\\frac{dV}{dx}$.

The DIBL coefficient is $D \\equiv |\\Delta V_{T}/\\Delta V_{DS}|$. This effect is governed by the two-dimensional electrostatics within the channel. The extent to which the drain potential perturbs the channel under the gate is described by a characteristic electrostatic length, $\\lambda$. Better gate control (i.e., in multi-gate devices) reduces this length, thereby suppressing short-channel effects like DIBL.\n\nFor a multi-gate FET, a first-order model for the square of the characteristic length, $\\lambda^2$, is given by:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 \\propto \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}} \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{si}} t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{N_g}\n$$\nThis expression shows that $\\lambda$ shrinks as gate control improves (increasing $N_g$, decreasing $t_{ox}$) and for thinner silicon bodies (decreasing $t_{si}$).\n\nThe DIBL coefficient, $D$, which represents the magnitude of the threshold voltage shift, is known from two-dimensional electrostatic analysis to scale with the square of the ratio of the characteristic length to the channel length, $L$, at leading order:\n$$\nD \\propto \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{L}\\right)^2\n$$\nSubstituting the scaling for $\\lambda^2$:\n$$\nD \\propto \\frac{1}{L^2} \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}} \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{si}} t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{N_g} \\right)\n$$\nThis provides the leading-order scaling of $D$ with the given device parameters. We can write this with a constant of proportionality, $K$:\n$$\nD = K \\left( \\frac{1}{N_g} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}} \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{si}} t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{L^2} \\right)\n$$\nThis shows that DIBL is suppressed by increasing $N_g$ and $L$, and by decreasing $t_{si}$ and $t_{ox}$, which is consistent with established device physics.\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation and Figure-of-Merit ($\\Xi$)**\n\nWe now compute the figure-of-merit $\\Xi$. First, we find the ratios $\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{planar}}}{S_{\\mathrm{GAA}}}$ and $\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{planar}}}{D_{\\mathrm{GAA}}}$.\n\n**Ratio of Subthreshold Swings:**\nLet $C = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} t_{\\mathrm{si}}}$.\n$$\nC = \\frac{11.7\\,\\varepsilon_{0}}{3.9\\,\\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{1.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{6.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 0.5\n$$\nThe expression for $S$ becomes $S = S_{\\mathrm{ideal}} (1 + C/N_g)$, where $S_{\\mathrm{ideal}} = \\frac{k_B T \\ln(10)}{q}$. The ratio is independent of $S_{\\mathrm{ideal}}$.\nFor the planar device, $N_{g, \\mathrm{planar}} = 1$. For the GAA device, $N_{g, \\mathrm{GAA}} = 4$.\n$$\n\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{planar}}}{S_{\\mathrm{GAA}}} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{ideal}}(1 + C/N_{g, \\mathrm{planar}})}{S_{\\mathrm{ideal}}(1 + C/N_{g, \\mathrm{GAA}})} = \\frac{1 + 0.5/1}{1 + 0.5/4} = \\frac{1.5}{1 + 0.125} = \\frac{1.5}{1.125} = \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\n\n**Ratio of DIBL Coefficients:**\nUsing the derived scaling relation for $D$:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{planar}}}{D_{\\mathrm{GAA}}} = \\frac{K \\left( \\frac{1}{N_{g, \\mathrm{planar}}} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}} \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{si}} t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{L^2} \\right)}{K \\left( \\frac{1}{N_{g, \\mathrm{GAA}}} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}} \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{si}} t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{L^2} \\right)}\n$$\nAll terms cancel except for the $N_g$ dependency:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{planar}}}{D_{\\mathrm{GAA}}} = \\frac{1/N_{g, \\mathrm{planar}}}{1/N_{g, \\mathrm{GAA}}} = \\frac{N_{g, \\mathrm{GAA}}}{N_{g, \\mathrm{planar}}} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4\n$$\n\n**Composite Figure-of-Merit ($\\Xi$):**\n$$\n\\Xi = \\left(\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{planar}}}{S_{\\mathrm{GAA}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{planar}}}{D_{\\mathrm{GAA}}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) \\times 4 = \\frac{16}{3}\n$$\nConverting to a decimal and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\Xi = 5.3333... \\approx 5.333\n$$\nThis result quantifies the substantial improvement in electrostatic integrity (lower subthreshold swing and less DIBL) offered by the GAA architecture compared to the planar architecture for the given technology parameters.",
