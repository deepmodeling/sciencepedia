The capacitor equations are fundamental electrostatics. The definition of dynamic switching energy is standard in VLSI power analysis. The alpha-power law ($t_{\\text{delay}}\\propto V_{DD}^{-\\alpha}$) is a widely used empirical model that captures carrier velocity saturation effects in modern short-channel transistors, making it a scientifically realistic approximation for this type of analysis.

It is a standard, formalizable problem in nanoelectronics and VLSI design.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of Solution\nSince the problem is valid, a full solution is now derived.\n\n**Part (a): Multiplicative Change Factor for Gate Delay**\n\nThe propagation delay, $t_{\\text{delay}}$, is given to be proportional to $V_{DD}^{-\\alpha}$. We can write this relationship with a constant of proportionality, $k$, which depends on other device parameters that are held constant.\n$$t_{\\text{delay}} = k V_{DD}^{-\\alpha}$$\nThe original delay at supply voltage $V_{DD,0} = V_{0}$ is:\n$$t_{\\text{delay},0} = k V_{0}^{-\\alpha}$$\nThe new supply voltage is $V_{DD,1} = 0.8 V_{0}$. The new delay at this voltage is:\n$$t_{\\text{delay},1} = k (V_{DD,1})^{-\\alpha} = k (0.8 V_{0})^{-\\alpha} = k (0.8)^{-\\alpha} V_{0}^{-\\alpha}$$\nThe multiplicative change factor for the delay is the ratio of the new delay to the original delay:\n$$\\text{Factor}_{\\text{delay}} = \\frac{t_{\\text{delay},1}}{t_{\\text{delay},0}} = \\frac{k (0.8)^{-\\alpha} V_{0}^{-\\alpha}}{k V_{0}^{-\\alpha}} = (0.8)^{-\\alpha}$$\nGiven $\\alpha=1.3$, we can calculate the numerical value of this factor:\n$$\\text{Factor}_{\\text{delay}} = (0.8)^{-1.3} = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{-1.3} = \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^{1.3} = (1.25)^{1.3}$$\nUsing a calculator, this value is approximately $1.336531...$.

Let's analyze this cycle.\n\n1.  **Charging Phase ($0 \\rightarrow 1$ transition)**: The output node, with capacitance $C_L$, is charged from a voltage of $0$ to $V_{DD}$. The total charge transferred from the supply to the capacitor is $\\Delta Q = C_L (V_{DD} - 0) = C_L V_{DD}$. The power supply provides this charge at a constant potential of $V_{DD}$. Therefore, the energy drawn from the supply during the charging phase is:\n    $$E_{\\text{supply, charge}} = \\Delta Q \\cdot V_{DD} = (C_L V_{DD}) \\cdot V_{DD} = C_L V_{DD}^2$$\n    Of this energy, half is stored in the capacitor ($E_C = \\frac{1}{2}C_L V_{DD}^2$) and the other half is dissipated as heat in the conducting PMOS transistor.\n\n2.  **Discharging Phase ($1 \\rightarrow 0$ transition)**: The output node is discharged from $V_{DD}$ to $0$ through the NMOS transistor to ground. During this phase, the PMOS transistor is off, and no charge is drawn from the $V_{DD}$ supply. The energy stored in the capacitor, $\\frac{1}{2}C_L V_{DD}^2$, is dissipated as heat in the conducting NMOS transistor. The energy drawn from the supply during this phase is:\n    $$E_{\\text{supply, discharge}} = 0$$\n\nThe total energy per toggle, $E_{\\text{toggle}}$, is the sum of the energies drawn from the supply in both phases:\n$$E_{\\text{toggle}} = E_{\\text{supply, charge}} + E_{\\text{supply, discharge}} = C_L V_{DD}^2 + 0 = C_L V_{DD}^2$$\nThe original energy per toggle at supply voltage $V_{DD,0} = V_{0}$ is:\n$$E_{\\text{toggle},0} = C_L V_{0}^2$$\nThe new energy per toggle at the reduced supply voltage $V_{DD,1} = 0.8 V_{0}$ is:\n$$E_{\\text{toggle},1} = C_L (V_{DD,1})^2 = C_L (0.8 V_{0})^2 = C_L (0.8)^2 V_{0}^2 = 0.64 C_L V_{0}^2$$\nThe multiplicative change factor for the energy per toggle is the ratio of the new energy to the original energy:\n$$\\text{Factor}_{\\text{energy}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{toggle},1}}{E_{\\text{toggle},0}} = \\frac{0.64 C_L V_{0}^2}{C_L V_{0}^2} = 0.64$$\nThe problem requires this to be expressed to four significant figures. Thus:\n$$\\text{Factor}_{\\text{energy}} = 0.6400$$\n\nThe final answer is the pair of factors for delay and energy, respectively.",

It is a standard exercise in semiconductor device physics that tests the understanding of fundamental MOSFET operating principles. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Subthreshold Swing $S$\n\nThe subthreshold swing $S$ is defined as the change in gate voltage $V_G$ required to change the drain current $I_D$ by one order of magnitude (one decade). The formal definition is:\n$$\nS \\equiv \\frac{d V_G}{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}\n$$\nTo derive an expression for $S$, it is more convenient to work with its reciprocal:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}{d V_G}\n$$\nUsing the chain rule of differentiation, we can expand this derivative to connect $I_D$ and $V_G$ through the intermediate variable, the surface potential $\\psi_s$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}{d(\\ln I_D)} \\cdot \\frac{d(\\ln I_D)}{d \\psi_s} \\cdot \\frac{d \\psi_s}{d V_G}\n$$\nWe evaluate each term separately.\n\n1.  The first term is a change of logarithm base, from base $10$ to natural logarithm:\n    Since $\\log_{10}(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(10)}$, its derivative with respect to $\\ln(x)$ is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}{d(\\ln I_D)} = \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)}\n    $$\n\n2.  The second term relates the drain current to the surface potential. We are given $I_D \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q \\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$. Let the constant of proportionality be $I_0$.\n    $$\n    I_D = I_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{q \\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)\n    $$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $$\n    \\ln(I_D) = \\ln(I_0) + \\frac{q \\psi_s}{k_B T}\n    $$\n    Differentiating with respect to $\\psi_s$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(\\ln I_D)}{d \\psi_s} = \\frac{q}{k_B T}\n    $$\n\n3.  The third term is given directly by the MOS electrostatic model:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d \\psi_s}{d V_G} = \\frac{C_{ox}}{C_{ox} + C_{dep}}\n    $$\n\nNow, we substitute these three terms back into the expression for $\\frac{1}{S}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{S} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\ln(10)}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{q}{k_B T}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{C_{ox}}{C_{ox} + C_{dep}}\\right)\n$$\nInverting the expression to solve for $S$:\n$$\nS = \\ln(10) \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\left(\\frac{C_{ox} + C_{dep}}{C_{ox}}\\right)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\nS = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln(10)\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{C_{dep}}{C_{ox}}\\right)\n$$\nThe first term, $\\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln(10)$, represents the theoretical minimum (ideal) subthreshold swing at a given temperature $T$. The second term, $\\left(1 + \\frac{C_{dep}}{C_{ox}}\\right)$, is a non-ideality factor greater than $1$, often denoted by $n$ or $m$, which accounts for the voltage division between the gate and the channel.\n\n### Numerical Calculation of $S$\n\nWe are given $T = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $C_{ox} = 2\\ \\mathrm{fF}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$, and $C_{dep} = 1\\ \\mathrm{fF}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$. We use the standard values for the physical constants $k_B \\approx 1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$ and $q \\approx 1.6022 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal voltage term, $\\frac{k_B T}{q}$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_B T}{q} = \\frac{(1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K})(300\\ \\mathrm{K})}{1.6022 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.02585\\ \\mathrm{V} = 25.85\\ \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\nThe ideal swing component is then:\n$$\n\\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln(10) \\approx (25.85\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\times 2.3026 \\approx 59.51\\ \\mathrm{mV/decade}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the capacitive factor:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{C_{dep}}{C_{ox}} = 1 + \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{fF}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2}{2\\ \\mathrm{fF}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2} = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5\n$$\nFinally, we compute $S$:\n$$\nS = (59.51\\ \\mathrm{mV/decade}) \\times 1.5 \\approx 89.27\\ \\mathrm{mV/decade}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we get $S = 89.3\\ \\mathrm{mV/decade}$.\n\n### Multiplicative Change in Off-State Current\n\nThe definition of the subthreshold swing $S$ can be written in differential form as:\n$$\nd(\\log_{10} I_D) = \\frac{1}{S} dV_G\n$$\nIn our model, $S$ is constant because $C_{ox}$ and $C_{dep}$ are treated as constants. We can therefore integrate this equation between an initial state $(V_{G,1}, I_{D,1})$ and a final state $(V_{G,2}, I_{D,2})$:\n$$\n\\int_{I_{D,1}}^{I_{D,2}} d(\\log_{10} I_D) = \\int_{V_{G,1}}^{V_{G,2}} \\frac{1}{S} dV_G\n$$\n$$\n\\log_{10}(I_{D,2}) - \\log_{10}(I_{D,1}) = \\frac{1}{S} (V_{G,2} - V_{G,1})\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{D,2}}{I_{D,1}}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta V_G}{S}\n$$\nThe problem states that the gate voltage is increased by exactly one subthreshold swing, so $\\Delta V_G = S$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{D,2}}{I_{D,1}}\\right) = \\frac{S}{S} = 1\n$$\nTo find the multiplicative change, which is the ratio $\\frac{I_{D,2}}{I_{D,1}}$, we solve for this ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{D,2}}{I_{D,1}} = 10^1 = 10\n$$\nThus, increasing the gate voltage by one subthreshold swing increases the off-state current by a factor of exactly $10$. This result is inherent in the definition of subthreshold swing in units of \"mV/decade\".",

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It addresses a fundamental issue in modern semiconductor device physics—direct source-to-drain tunneling in short-channel transistors. The model provided (a parabolic potential barrier) and the suggested method of solution (semiclassical WKB approximation) are standard and appropriate for an estimation of this kind. All necessary parameters and constants are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts: a qualitative explanation of the increase in tunneling with decreasing channel length and a quantitative estimation of the minimum channel length $L_{\\min}$.\n\n**Part 1: Qualitative Explanation**\n\nThe transport of charge carriers (electrons or holes) through the channel of a field-effect transistor is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics. In the off-state, a potential energy barrier prevents carriers from flowing from the source to the drain. The behavior of a carrier with energy $E$ and effective mass $m^{\\ast}$ is described by the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation along the transport direction $x$:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^{\\ast}}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)\n$$\nwhere $\\psi(x)$ is the carrier's wavefunction, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $V(x)$ is the potential energy profile of the channel barrier.\n\nFor a carrier injected from the source with an energy $E$ that is less than the barrier height $V_0$, classical physics predicts zero transmission. However, quantum mechanics permits a non-zero probability of the carrier \"tunneling\" through the barrier. Inside the classically forbidden region, where $V(x) > E$, the Schrödinger equation can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = \\frac{2m^{\\ast}}{\\hbar^2}(V(x) - E)\\psi(x) = \\kappa(x)^2 \\psi(x)\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m^{\\ast}(V(x) - E)}}{\\hbar}$ is the real-valued decay constant. The general solutions in this region are evanescent waves of the form $\\psi(x) \\propto \\exp(\\pm \\int \\kappa(x) dx)$, which decay exponentially with distance.\n\nThe semiclassical Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation provides an expression for the transmission probability, $T$, through the potential barrier:\n$$\nT \\approx \\exp\\left(-2 \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\kappa(x) \\,dx\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2}{\\hbar} \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\sqrt{2m^{\\ast}(V(x) - E)} \\,dx\\right)\n$$\nwhere $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the classical turning points, defined by $V(x) = E$. The integral is taken over the entire width of the barrier at energy $E$.\n\nWhen the physical channel length $L$ is reduced, the spatial extent of the potential barrier $V(x)$ shrinks. This means the integration limits $[x_1, x_2]$ become closer. Since the integrand $\\sqrt{2m^{\\ast}(V(x) - E)}$ is always non-negative, shortening the integration path leads to a smaller value for the integral. This, in turn, makes the negative exponent in the expression for $T$ smaller in magnitude (i.e., less negative). Consequently, the transmission probability $T$ increases, and it does so exponentially with the barrier width.\n\nIn a transistor, the off-state current, $I_{\\mathrm{off}}$, is the leakage current that flows when the device is supposed to be \"off\". This leakage is ideally zero, but is practically determined by several mechanisms, including source-to-drain tunneling. The on-state current, $I_{\\mathrm{on}}$, flows when the barrier is lowered, allowing carriers to pass. The ratio $I_{\\mathrm{on}}/I_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is a critical figure of merit, indicating how effectively the transistor functions as a switch. As $L$ is scaled down, the tunneling component of $I_{\\mathrm{off}}$ increases exponentially, causing the $I_{\\mathrm{on}}/I_{\\mathrm{off}}$ ratio to degrade severely, which compromises the fundamental switching action of the device.\n\n**Part 2: Quantitative Estimation of $L_{\\min}$**\n\nWe are asked to find the minimum channel length $L_{\\min}$ for which the tunneling current is no more than a fraction $0.01$ of the on-state current. The problem states we can approximate the ratio of the currents by the transmission probability $T$. Thus, we set the condition $T \\le 0.01$. The minimum length $L_{\\min}$ will correspond to the equality:\n$$\nT = 0.01\n$$\nThe potential barrier is given by $V(x)=V_{0}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2x}{L}\\right)^{2}\\right)$ for $|x|\\leq \\frac{L}{2}$. The carrier energy is taken to be near the source conduction-band edge, which corresponds to $E=0$ in the given potential model.\n\nFirst, we find the classical turning points $x_1, x_2$ by solving $V(x) = E=0$:\n$$V_{0}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2x}{L}\\right)^{2}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\left(\\frac{2x}{L}\\right)^{2} = 1 \\implies x = \\pm \\frac{L}{2}$$\nSo, $x_1 = -L/2$ and $x_2 = L/2$. The WKB exponent argument, which we denote as $\\gamma$, is:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{2}{\\hbar} \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\sqrt{2m^{\\ast}\\left(V_{0}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2x}{L}\\right)^{2}\\right) - 0\\right)} \\,dx\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2m^{\\ast}V_0}}{\\hbar} \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{2x}{L}\\right)^{2}} \\,dx\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we perform a substitution. Let $u = \\frac{2x}{L}$, so $du = \\frac{2}{L}dx$, and $dx = \\frac{L}{2}du$. The limits of integration change from $x = -L/2$ to $u = -1$, and from $x = L/2$ to $u = 1$.\n$$\n\\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{2x}{L}\\right)^{2}} \\,dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\sqrt{1-u^2} \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\,du = \\frac{L}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\sqrt{1-u^2} \\,du\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{-1}^{1} \\sqrt{1-u^2} \\,du$ represents the area of a semicircle of radius $1$, which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi r^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTherefore, the integral is $\\frac{L}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi L}{4}$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2m^{\\ast}V_0}}{\\hbar} \\left(\\frac{\\pi L}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi L \\sqrt{2m^{\\ast}V_0}}{2\\hbar}\n$$\nThe transmission probability is $T = \\exp(-\\gamma) = 0.01$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\gamma = \\ln(0.01) = \\ln(10^{-2}) = -2\\ln(10) \\implies \\gamma = 2\\ln(10)$$\nNow we equate the two expressions for $\\gamma$ and solve for $L$, which will be $L_{\\min}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi L_{\\min} \\sqrt{2m^{\\ast}V_0}}{2\\hbar} = 2\\ln(10)\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\min} = \\frac{4\\hbar \\ln(10)}{\\pi \\sqrt{2m^{\\ast}V_0}}\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values, ensuring all are in SI units.\n$V_0 = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 0.2 \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J}) = 3.204 \\times 10^{-20}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n$m^{\\ast} = 0.19\\,m_0 = 0.19 \\times (9.109 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}) = 1.7307 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n$\\hbar = 1.055 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,s}$\n$\\ln(10) \\approx 2.3026$\n\nFirst, calculate the term in the square root:\n$$\n2m^{\\ast}V_0 = 2 \\times (1.7307 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}) \\times (3.204 \\times 10^{-20}\\ \\mathrm{J}) \\approx 1.1090 \\times 10^{-50}\\ \\mathrm{kg^2 m^2 s^{-2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{2m^{\\ast}V_0} \\approx \\sqrt{1.1090 \\times 10^{-50}} \\approx 1.0531 \\times 10^{-25}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nNow we can compute $L_{\\min}$:\n$$\nL_{\\min} = \\frac{4 \\times (1.055 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,s}) \\times 2.3026}{\\pi \\times (1.0531 \\times 10^{-25}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m\\,s^{-1}})}\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\min} \\approx \\frac{9.715 \\times 10^{-34}}{3.308 \\times 10^{-25}}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 2.937 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nConverting to nanometers:\n$$\nL_{\\min} \\approx 2.937\\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the minimum channel length is $2.94\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.",
