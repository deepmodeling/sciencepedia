            "solution": "This problem is analyzed in two parts. The first part addresses the ideal metal-semiconductor contact as described by the Schottky-Mott model. The second part introduces the effects of interface states through a linear Fermi-level pinning model.\n\nThe problem statement has been validated and is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. All necessary physical quantities and model assumptions are provided.\n\nPart 1: Ideal Electron Barrier Height\n\nIn the ideal case, free of interface states, the electron Schottky barrier height, $\\Phi_{Bn}^{\\mathrm{ideal}}$, is determined by the Schottky-Mott rule. This model assumes that when the metal and semiconductor are brought into contact, their vacuum levels align. The barrier for an electron to move from the metal into the semiconductor's conduction band is then the difference between the metal's work function, $\\Phi_M$, and the semiconductor's electron affinity, $\\chi$. The work function $\\Phi_M$ is the energy required to move an electron from the metal's Fermi level to the vacuum level. The electron affinity $\\chi$ is the energy released when an electron is moved from the vacuum level to the semiconductor's conduction band minimum, $E_C$.\n\nThe ideal electron barrier height is therefore given by the expression:\n$$\n\\Phi_{Bn}^{\\mathrm{ideal}} = \\Phi_M - \\chi\n$$\nUsing the provided values for titanium and silicon:\n$\\Phi_M = 4.33\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n$\\chi = 4.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n\nWe can compute the ideal barrier height:\n$$\n\\Phi_{Bn}^{\\mathrm{ideal}} = 4.33\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 4.05\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.28\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThis ideal value of $0.28\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ is significantly different from the measured value of $\\Phi_{Bn}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, which indicates that the simple Schottky-Mott model is insufficient and that interface effects, such as Fermi-level pinning, are present.\n\nPart 2: Pinning Factor Calculation\n\nTo account for the discrepancy, the problem introduces a model for Fermi-level pinning by metal-induced gap states (MIGS). The model states that the position of the Fermi level at the interface, $E_{F, \\text{int}}$, is a linear interpolation between the position it would have in the ideal Schottky-Mott case (determined by the metal work function) and a charge neutrality level (CNL), $E_{CNL}$, intrinsic to the semiconductor surface. This relationship is governed by the dimensionless pinning factor, $S$.\n\nLet all energy levels be referenced to the vacuum level, which is set to $0$.\nThe position of the metal's Fermi level is $E_{F,M} = -\\Phi_M$.\nThe problem states that the CNL lies at midgap. The energy of the conduction band minimum is $E_C = -\\chi$, and the energy of the valence band maximum is $E_V = -(\\chi + E_g)$. The midgap energy is therefore:\n$$\nE_{CNL} = E_V + \\frac{E_g}{2} = -(\\chi + E_g) + \\frac{E_g}{2} = -\\left(\\chi + \\frac{E_g}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe linear interpolation for the interface Fermi level is:\n$$\nE_{F, \\text{int}} = S \\cdot E_{F,M} + (1-S) \\cdot E_{CNL}\n$$\nThis formulation correctly captures the two limits: for $S=1$ (no pinning), $E_{F, \\text{int}} = E_{F,M}$; for $S=0$ (strong pinning), $E_{F, \\text{int}} = E_{CNL}$.\n\nThe electron Schottky barrier height, $\\Phi_{Bn}$, is defined as the energy difference between the conduction band minimum at the interface, $E_C$, and the interface Fermi level, $E_{F, \\text{int}}$.\n$$\n\\Phi_{Bn} = E_C - E_{F, \\text{int}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the energy levels relative to vacuum ($E_C = -\\chi$):\n$$\n\\Phi_{Bn} = -\\chi - E_{F, \\text{int}} = -\\chi - \\left[ S \\cdot E_{F,M} + (1-S) \\cdot E_{CNL} \\right]\n$$\nNow, substitute the expressions for $E_{F,M}$ and $E_{CNL}$:\n$$\n\\Phi_{Bn} = -\\chi - \\left[ S \\cdot (-\\Phi_M) + (1-S) \\cdot \\left(-\\left(\\chi + \\frac{E_g}{2}\\right)\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi_{Bn} = -\\chi + S\\Phi_M + (1-S)\\left(\\chi + \\frac{E_g}{2}\\right)\n$$\nExpanding the last term:\n$$\n\\Phi_{Bn} = -\\chi + S\\Phi_M + \\chi + \\frac{E_g}{2} - S\\chi - S\\frac{E_g}{2}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression by grouping terms with $S$:\n$$\n\\Phi_{Bn} = S(\\Phi_M - \\chi) + (1-S)\\frac{E_g}{2}\n$$\nThis expression relates the barrier height $\\Phi_{Bn}$ to the material properties and the pinning factor $S$. The definition of $S$ as the sensitivity of the barrier to the metal work function, $S = \\frac{d\\Phi_{Bn}}{d\\Phi_M}$, is consistent with this derived formula.\n\nWe can now solve for the pinning factor $S$ using the measured barrier height, $\\Phi_{Bn}^{\\mathrm{meas}}$.\n$$\n\\Phi_{Bn}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = S(\\Phi_M - \\chi) + \\frac{E_g}{2} - S\\frac{E_g}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi_{Bn}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - \\frac{E_g}{2} = S\\left( (\\Phi_M - \\chi) - \\frac{E_g}{2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\Phi_{Bn}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - \\frac{E_g}{2}}{(\\Phi_M - \\chi) - \\frac{E_g}{2}}\n$$\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n$\\Phi_{Bn}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n$\\Phi_M = 4.33\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n$\\chi = 4.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n$E_g = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n\nFirst, calculate the intermediate terms:\n$$\n\\frac{E_g}{2} = \\frac{1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{2} = 0.56\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi_M - \\chi = 4.33\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 4.05\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.28\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $S$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{0.50\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.56\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{0.28\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.56\\,\\mathrm{eV}} = \\frac{-0.06\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{-0.28\\,\\mathrm{eV}} = \\frac{6}{28} = \\frac{3}{14}\n$$\nEvaluating the fraction gives:\n$$\nS \\approx 0.2142857...\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested, we obtain:\n$$\nS \\approx 0.214\n$$\nThis value, being much less than $1$, confirms that the Ti/n-Si interface is subject to significant Fermi-level pinning, moving it away from the ideal Schottky-Mott behavior and towards the Bardeen limit where the barrier height is determined primarily by interface states.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe contact resistance $R_c$ is the inverse of the contact conductance $G$, given by $R_c = 1/G$. We begin by deriving the conductance using the Landauer formalism. The Landauer formula for a multi-channel conductor is:\n$$\nG = G_0 \\sum_{i} T_i\n$$\nwhere $T_i$ is the transmission probability of the $i$-th conducting channel and $G_0$ is the quantum of conductance per channel. The problem states that spin degeneracy is accounted for in this prefactor, which sets $G_0 = 2q^2/h = q^2/(\\pi\\hbar)$, where $q$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $\\hbar = h/(2\\pi)$ is the reduced Planck constant. The problem also specifies unity transmission for all available modes, so $T_i=1$ for every propagating mode. The summation then simplifies to counting the total number of available conducting modes, $M$.\n$$\nG = \\frac{2q^2}{h} M\n$$\nThe total number of modes $M$ is the product of the number of orbital (or transverse spatial) modes $M_{orb}$ and the valley degeneracy $g_v$. The spin degeneracy is already included in the prefactor. Given $g_v=2$, we have $M = g_v M_{orb} = 2 M_{orb}$.\n\nTo find $M_{orb}$, we consider the quantization of the electron wavevector in the graphene sheet of width $W$. Let the direction of transport be along the $x$-axis and the confined direction be along the $y$-axis. For a width $W$, we can impose hard-wall boundary conditions, which quantizes the transverse component of the wavevector, $k_y$:\n$$\nk_y = \\frac{n\\pi}{W}, \\quad \\text{where } n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n$$\nThe energy dispersion relation for low-energy quasiparticles in graphene is $E = \\hbar v_F |k|$, where $|k| = \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$. At the Fermi level in the contact region, the energy is $E = \\Delta E_F$. Thus, the magnitude of the Fermi wavevector is $k_F = |\\Delta E_F| / (\\hbar v_F)$.\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_F}{\\hbar v_F}\\right)^2 = k_x^2 + k_y^2\n$$\nA mode is a propagating mode if its longitudinal wavevector component, $k_x$, is real. This requires $k_x^2 \\ge 0$, which leads to the condition:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_F}{\\hbar v_F}\\right)^2 \\ge k_y^2\n$$\nSubstituting the quantized values for $k_y$:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\Delta E_F|}{\\hbar v_F} \\ge \\frac{n\\pi}{W}\n$$\nThe number of orbital modes, $M_{orb}$, is the total number of integer values of $n$ that satisfy this condition.\n$$\nn \\le \\frac{W |\\Delta E_F|}{\\pi \\hbar v_F}\n$$\nTherefore, $M_{orb}$ is the largest integer less than or equal to this value:\n$$\nM_{orb} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{W |\\Delta E_F|}{\\pi \\hbar v_F} \\right\\rfloor\n$$\nFor typical device parameters, such as those given in this problem, the number of modes is large ($M_{orb} \\gg 1$). In this regime, it is an excellent approximation to neglect the floor function and treat the number of modes as a continuous quantity:\n$$\nM_{orb} \\approx \\frac{W |\\Delta E_F|}{\\pi \\hbar v_F}\n$$\nThe total number of conducting channels is $M = 2 M_{orb}$:\n$$\nM \\approx \\frac{2 W |\\Delta E_F|}{\\pi \\hbar v_F}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this into the Landauer formula for conductance:\n$$\nG = \\frac{2q^2}{h} M \\approx \\frac{2q^2}{h} \\left(\\frac{2 W |\\Delta E_F|}{\\pi \\hbar v_F}\\right) = \\frac{4 q^2 W |\\Delta E_F|}{h \\pi \\hbar v_F}\n$$\nThe contact resistance $R_c$ is the inverse of the conductance $G$:\n$$\nR_c = \\frac{1}{G} \\approx \\frac{h \\pi \\hbar v_F}{4 q^2 W |\\Delta E_F|}\n$$\nThis expression gives the dependence of $R_c$ on $\\Delta E_F$; specifically, $R_c \\propto 1/|\\Delta E_F|$. We can write this more compactly by substituting $h=2\\pi\\hbar$:\n$$\nR_c = \\frac{(2\\pi\\hbar) \\pi \\hbar v_F}{4 q^2 W |\\Delta E_F|} = \\frac{2\\pi^2 \\hbar^2 v_F}{4 q^2 W |\\Delta E_F|} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2 v_F}{2 q^2 W |\\Delta E_F|}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are asked to evaluate $R_c$ for the given parameters:\n- $W = 1.00\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $v_F = 1.00 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n- $\\Delta E_F = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n\nWe use the following physical constants:\n- $\\hbar \\approx 1.05457 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s}$\n- $q \\approx 1.60218 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nFirst, we must convert the energy $\\Delta E_F$ to SI units (Joules):\n$$\n\\Delta E_F = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{eV} \\times (1.60218 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J/eV}) \\approx 4.00545 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n$$\nNow, we substitute all values into the derived expression for $R_c$:\n$$\nR_c = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2 v_F}{2 q^2 W \\Delta E_F}\n$$\n$$\nR_c \\approx \\frac{(3.14159)^2 (1.05457 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s})^2 (1.00 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m/s})}{2 (1.60218 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})^2 (1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) (4.00545 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J})}\n$$\nLet's compute the numerator and denominator separately.\nNumerator:\n$$\nN = (9.86960) \\times (1.11212 \\times 10^{-68}\\,\\mathrm{J^2 s^2}) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) \\approx 1.09748 \\times 10^{-61}\\,\\mathrm{J^2 \\cdot s \\cdot m}\n$$\nDenominator:\n$$\nD = 2 \\times (2.56698 \\times 10^{-38}\\,\\mathrm{C^2}) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (4.00545 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\approx 2.05630 \\times 10^{-63}\\,\\mathrm{C^2 \\cdot m \\cdot J}\n$$\nNow, we compute the ratio:\n$$\nR_c = \\frac{N}{D} \\approx \\frac{1.09748 \\times 10^{-61}}{2.05630 \\times 10^{-63}}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{J^2 \\cdot s \\cdot m}}{\\mathrm{C^2 \\cdot m \\cdot J}} \\approx 53.371\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{J \\cdot s}}{\\mathrm{C^2}}\n$$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{J \\cdot s / C^2}$ is equivalent to the Ohm ($\\Omega$), since voltage $V = J/C$ and current $I = C/s$, so resistance $R=V/I = (J/C)/(C/s) = J \\cdot s / C^2$.\nThe calculated value is $R_c \\approx 53.371\\,\\Omega$.

The ionized-impurity scattering rate, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}^{-1}$, is stated to scale linearly with the sheet carrier density, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}^{-1} \\propto n$. Since mobility is related to the scattering time by $\\mu = q\\tau/m^*$ (where $m^*$ is the effective mass), the impurity-limited mobility is inversely proportional to the scattering rate, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{imp}} \\propto \\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}$.

The formula for a single contact resistance simplifies to:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{c}}(n) \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho_c R_{\\mathrm{sh}}(n)}}{W}$$\nTherefore, the total contact resistance for both source and drain is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{c,tot}}(n) = 2 R_{\\mathrm{c}}(n) = \\frac{2}{W} \\sqrt{\\rho_c R_{\\mathrm{sh}}(n)} = \\frac{2}{W} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c}{q n \\mu(n)}} = \\frac{2}{W} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c(1 + n/n_{\\mathrm{ref}})}{q n \\mu_0}}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the total resistance for states $n_0$ and $n_1$.\nThe given parameters in SI units are:\n$W = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$L = 3.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{C}$\n$\\rho_{c} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n$\\mu_{0} = 0.0050 \\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$n_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{16} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n$n_{0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{16} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n$n_{1} = 4.0 \\times 10^{16} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n\nFor the initial state (density $n_0$):\nThe mobility is $\\mu(n_0) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{1 + n_0/n_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{0.0050}{1 + (1.0 \\times 10^{16})/(5.0 \\times 10^{16})} = \\frac{0.0050}{1.2} \\approx 4.1667 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nSheet resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{sh},0} = \\frac{1}{q n_0 \\mu(n_0)} = \\frac{1}{(1.6022 \\times 10^{-19})(1.0 \\times 10^{16})(4.1667 \\times 10^{-3})} \\approx 149801 \\,\\Omega$.\nChannel resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{ch},0} = R_{\\mathrm{sh},0} \\frac{L}{W} = 149801 \\times \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}} = 149801 \\times 0.03 \\approx 4494.0 \\,\\Omega$.\nTotal contact resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{c,tot},0} = \\frac{2}{W} \\sqrt{\\rho_c R_{\\mathrm{sh},0}} = \\frac{2}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}} \\sqrt{(1.0 \\times 10^{-8})(149801)} \\approx 77408 \\,\\Omega$.\nTotal resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{tot},0} = R_{\\mathrm{ch},0} + R_{\\mathrm{c,tot},0} = 4494.0 + 77408 = 81902 \\,\\Omega$.\n\nFor the final state (density $n_1$):\nThe mobility is $\\mu(n_1) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{1 + n_1/n_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{0.0050}{1 + (4.0 \\times 10^{16})/(5.0 \\times 10^{16})} = \\frac{0.0050}{1.8} \\approx 2.7778 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nSheet resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{sh},1} = \\frac{1}{q n_1 \\mu(n_1)} = \\frac{1}{(1.6022 \\times 10^{-19})(4.0 \\times 10^{16})(2.7778 \\times 10^{-3})} \\approx 56175 \\,\\Omega$.\nChannel resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{ch},1} = R_{\\mathrm{sh},1} \\frac{L}{W} = 56175 \\times 0.03 \\approx 1685.3 \\,\\Omega$.\nTotal contact resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{c,tot},1} = \\frac{2}{W} \\sqrt{\\rho_c R_{\\mathrm{sh},1}} = \\frac{2}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}} \\sqrt{(1.0 \\times 10^{-8})(56175)} \\approx 47402 \\,\\Omega$.\nTotal resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{tot},1} = R_{\\mathrm{ch},1} + R_{\\mathrm{c,tot},1} = 1685.3 + 47402 = 49087 \\,\\Omega$.\n\nFinally, the current gain factor is the ratio of the total resistances:\n$$\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{on},1}}{I_{\\mathrm{on},0}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{tot},0}}{R_{\\mathrm{tot},1}} = \\frac{81902}{49087} \\approx 1.66851$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $1.669$.",
