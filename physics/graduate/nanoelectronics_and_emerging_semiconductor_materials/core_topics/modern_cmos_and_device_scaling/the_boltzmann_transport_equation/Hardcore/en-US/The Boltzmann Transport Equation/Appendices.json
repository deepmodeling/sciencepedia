The physics of scattering is encapsulated in the collision integral, $I[f]$.

The statistical properties of the simulated ensemble are designed to reproduce the solution to the BTE.\n\nThe probabilistic foundation of the EMC method lies in the integral form of the BTE. The probability that a particle that is in state $\\mathbf{k}$ at time $t_0=0$ will survive without scattering until time $t$ is given by $P(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} \\Gamma(\\mathbf{k}(t')) dt'\\right)$, where $\\Gamma(\\mathbf{k}(t'))$ is the total instantaneous scattering rate along the carrier's trajectory in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. A random free-flight time $t_{\\mathrm{ff}}$ is sampled by setting $P(t_{\\mathrm{ff}}) = \\xi$, where $\\xi$ is a random variate uniformly distributed in $(0, 1)$. This leads to the fundamental equation for the free-flight time: $\\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{ff}}} \\Gamma(\\mathbf{k}(t')) dt' = -\\ln \\xi$. At the end of the free flight, a scattering event occurs. The specific scattering mechanism and the final state are chosen probabilistically according to their respective transition rates.\n\nWe now evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n**Option A:** During free flight in the semiclassical regime, the equations of motion are $\\hbar \\dot{\\mathbf{k}} = -q\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r},t)$ and $\\dot{\\mathbf{r}} = \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} E(\\mathbf{k})$.

The equations of motion are the standard semiclassical ones. The expression $\\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{ff}}}\\Gamma(\\mathbf{k}(t'))\\,\\mathrm{d}t' = -\\ln \\xi$ is the general and formally exact method for sampling $t_{\\mathrm{ff}}$ when the scattering rate $\\Gamma$ varies along the particle's k-space trajectory (e.g., due to energy-dependent scattering rates and acceleration by the electric field). If $\\Gamma$ happens to be constant along the trajectory, the integral simplifies to $\\Gamma t_{\\mathrm{ff}} = -\\ln \\xi$, which implies $t_{\\mathrm{ff}} = -(\\ln \\xi) / \\Gamma$. This is precisely the formula for sampling a random variable from an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\Gamma$ and mean $1/\\Gamma$. The statement correctly presents the general case and its important special case.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B:** At a scattering event, mechanism $i$ is selected by drawing $\\xi\\in(0,1)$ and finding the smallest $i$ such that $\\sum_{j\\le i}\\Gamma_j(\\mathbf{k})/\\Gamma(\\mathbf{k}) \\ge \\xi$. The post-scattering state $\\mathbf{k}'$ is then sampled from the normalized differential kernel $W_i(\\mathbf{k}\\to\\mathbf{k}')/\\Gamma_i(\\mathbf{k})$, enforcing Pauli blocking under degeneracy by weighting transitions with the factor $\\left(1 - f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{k}',t)\\right)$.\n\nThis statement correctly describes the procedure at a scattering event. First, a specific scattering mechanism must be chosen from the available ones. The probability of choosing mechanism $i$ is $p_i = \\Gamma_i(\\mathbf{k}) / \\Gamma(\\mathbf{k})$, where $\\Gamma(\\mathbf{k})=\\sum_i \\Gamma_i(\\mathbf{k})$. The described method, using a cumulative probability, is the standard inverse transform sampling technique for a discrete probability distribution. Second, once mechanism $i$ is chosen, the final state $\\mathbf{k}'$ must be selected according to its probability distribution, which is given by the normalized differential scattering rate $W_i(\\mathbf{k}\\to\\mathbf{k}')/\\Gamma_i(\\mathbf{k})$. Finally, for fermions under degenerate conditions, the Pauli exclusion principle must be respected. The term $(1-f(\\mathbf{k}'))$ in the BTE collision integral represents the probability that the final state $\\mathbf{k}'$ is unoccupied and thus available. In EMC, this is typically implemented via a rejection step: a proposed transition to $\\mathbf{k}'$ is accepted with probability $(1-f(\\mathbf{k}'))$. The statement's phrasing \"weighting transitions with the factor\" correctly captures this physical requirement.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option C:** To maintain efficiency in spatially varying conditions, one must fix a constant global rate $\\Gamma_0$ and always draw $t_{\\mathrm{ff}}$ from $\\exp(-\\Gamma_0 t)$; upon the scheduled collision, accept a physical scattering with probability $\\Gamma(\\mathbf{k})/\\Gamma_0$, and otherwise perform a self-scattering that randomizes the particle’s direction to avoid bias.\n\nThis statement describes the null-collision or self-scattering method, which is a valid and often efficient technique. The first part is correct: one introduces a constant rate $\\Gamma_0$ that must be an upper bound on the true total scattering rate, $\\Gamma_0 \\ge \\Gamma(\\mathbf{k}(t))$, for all relevant states. Free-flight times are then sampled from an exponential distribution with this constant rate $\\Gamma_0$. Upon a scheduled collision, a real scattering occurs with probability $\\Gamma(\\mathbf{k})/\\Gamma_0$. However, the description of the alternative event is critically flawed. If a physical scattering is rejected (which happens with probability $1 - \\Gamma(\\mathbf{k})/\\Gamma_0$), a \"self-scattering\" (or \"null\") event occurs. A self-scattering event, by definition, must *not* change the particle's state. The particle continues its trajectory as if no collision happened. The statement claims one should \"perform a self-scattering that randomizes the particle’s direction\". This would introduce a spurious, unphysical scattering process, fundamentally altering the physics being simulated and leading to incorrect results.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:** Because the BTE collision operator acts as a loss term, individual free-flight times must be sampled from a Gaussian distribution centered at the mean free time to reflect the central limit behavior of many collisions.\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The semiclassical BTE assumes that scattering events are instantaneous and uncorrelated (Markovian). This means the probability of scattering in a small time interval $dt$ is $\\Gamma dt$, regardless of the time elapsed since the last collision. A process with this memoryless property is a Poisson process, and the time between events in a Poisson process follows an exponential distribution, not a Gaussian one. The Central Limit Theorem describes the distribution of the sum of many random variables; it does not apply to the distribution of a single one of these variables (a single free-flight time).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option E:** Under degenerate conditions, enforcing the exclusion principle is best done by proposing a final state $\\mathbf{k}'$ from the unblocked kernel and rejecting it with probability $f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{k}',t)$; this rejection scheme leaves the average scattering rate and the free-flight time distribution unchanged.\n\nThe first part of the statement describes the standard rejection-sampling technique for implementing Pauli blocking: accept the transition to $\\mathbf{k}'$ with probability $(1-f(\\mathbf{k}'))$, which is equivalent to rejecting it with probability $f(\\mathbf{k}')$. This part is correct. However, the second part of the statement is incorrect. The introduction of final state blocking necessarily reduces the rate of successful, state-changing physical scattering events. While the free-flight time might be calculated using the total *unblocked* scattering rate $\\Gamma(\\mathbf{k})$, the *effective* rate of scattering that actually changes the particle state is reduced to $\\Gamma_{\\text{eff}}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}'} W(\\mathbf{k}\\to\\mathbf{k}')(1-f(\\mathbf{k}')) < \\Gamma(\\mathbf{k})$. Therefore, the \"average scattering rate,\" in the physically meaningful sense of state-altering collisions, is certainly changed (reduced). The statement that the rate is \"unchanged\" is misleading and false. This reduction in scattering is the entire physical point of Pauli blocking—it suppresses scattering into occupied states, increasing carrier mobility.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option F:** In steady state, the drift velocity $\\langle v_d\\rangle$ can be estimated by averaging the instantaneous velocity component along the field direction over the ensemble throughout the simulation time, i.e., summing particle velocities during free flights and scattering instants and dividing by the number of samples, and this estimator converges to the first velocity moment of the BTE solution given sufficient sampling.\n\nThis statement correctly describes how macroscopic quantities are extracted from an EMC simulation. The EMC method generates an ensemble of particles whose distribution in phase space, $f(\\mathbf{k})$, converges to the solution of the steady-state BTE. Macroscopic observables correspond to moments of this distribution. The drift velocity, for instance, is the first moment of velocity: $\\langle \\mathbf{v} \\rangle = \\int \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{k}) f(\\mathbf{k}) d\\mathbf{k} / \\int f(\\mathbf{k}) d\\mathbf{k}$. According to the ergodic principle, this ensemble average is equivalent to a long-time average over the trajectories of the particles in the simulation. The procedure described—averaging the velocity over the ensemble and simulation time—is precisely how this expectation value is computed. The phrase \"and scattering instants\" is slightly imprecise as scattering is treated as instantaneous, but the overall principle is sound: the velocity is averaged over the particles' histories. This average, given a large enough ensemble and long enough simulation time, correctly estimates the true drift velocity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
