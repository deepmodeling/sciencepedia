            "problem": "An undoped silicon $n$-type Fin Field-Effect Transistor (FinFET) employs a metal gate over a high-permittivity dielectric whose Equivalent Oxide Thickness (EOT) is $0.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. For undoped silicon operated at intrinsic condition, the Fermi potential in the body satisfies $\\phi_{F}=0$. The gate dielectric contains a positive fixed charge at the interface of areal density $Q_{f}=1.0\\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ (taken as positive elementary charges per unit area). The device target is a threshold voltage $V_{T}=0.35\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nStarting from electrostatics of the metal–oxide–semiconductor stack and the definition of flat-band, derive the required metal work function $\\Phi_{M}$ (relative to vacuum) that achieves the specified threshold for the undoped body. Use the following well-tested material parameters at $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n- Elementary charge $q=1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$.\n- Vacuum permittivity $\\epsilon_{0}=8.854187817\\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm}$.\n- Silicon dioxide relative permittivity $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}=3.9$.\n- Silicon electron affinity $\\chi_{\\mathrm{Si}}=4.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- Silicon bandgap $E_{g}=1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nAssume that, for an undoped body at intrinsic condition, the threshold voltage coincides with the flat-band condition because there is no depletion charge and $\\phi_{F}=0$, so $V_{T}=V_{FB}$. Express the final answer for $\\Phi_{M}$ in electronvolts (eV) and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "To determine the required metal gate work function, $\\Phi_{M}$, we first establish the relationship between the threshold voltage, $V_T$, and the flat-band voltage, $V_{FB}$, for the given device. The problem states that the silicon body is undoped and at intrinsic condition, meaning the Fermi potential $\\phi_{F} = 0$. In this special case, the contributions to the threshold voltage from the surface potential ($2\\phi_F$) and the depletion charge ($Q_{dep}$) are both zero. The standard expression for threshold voltage thus simplifies to the flat-band voltage, as asserted in the problem:\n$$V_{T} = V_{FB}$$\n\nThe flat-band voltage is defined by the electrostatics of the MOS stack:\n$$V_{FB} = \\phi_{M} - \\phi_{S} - \\frac{Q_{f}'}{C_{ox}}$$\nHere, $\\phi_{M}$ is the metal work function potential (in Volts), $\\phi_{S}$ is the semiconductor work function potential (in Volts), $Q_{f}'$ is the fixed interface charge density (in $\\mathrm{C/cm^2}$), and $C_{ox}$ is the gate dielectric capacitance per unit area (in $\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$). Our goal is to solve for $\\phi_{M}$ and then state the result for $\\Phi_{M}$ in electronvolts (eV), as $\\Phi_{M}$ (in eV) is numerically equal to $\\phi_{M}$ (in V).\n\nWe will now calculate each term in the equation for $V_{FB}$.\n\n1.  **Semiconductor Work Function Potential ($\\phi_{S}$)**\n    The work function of the semiconductor, $\\Phi_{S}$, is given by $\\Phi_{S} = \\chi_{\\mathrm{Si}} + (E_{C} - E_{F})$, where $\\chi_{\\mathrm{Si}}$ is the silicon electron affinity. For an intrinsic semiconductor, the Fermi level is at the intrinsic level, $E_{F} = E_{i}$. The energy difference between the conduction band and the intrinsic level is approximately half the bandgap, $E_{C} - E_{i} \\approx \\frac{E_{g}}{2}$.\n    Thus, the semiconductor work function in eV is:\n    $$\\Phi_{S} = \\chi_{\\mathrm{Si}} + \\frac{E_{g}}{2}$$\n    Using the given values $\\chi_{\\mathrm{Si}} = 4.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $E_{g} = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$:\n    $$\\Phi_{S} = 4.05\\,\\mathrm{eV} + \\frac{1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{2} = 4.05\\,\\mathrm{eV} + 0.56\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 4.61\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n    The corresponding work function potential is $\\phi_{S} = 4.61\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\n2.  **Gate Dielectric Capacitance ($C_{ox}$)**\n    The problem specifies an Equivalent Oxide Thickness (EOT) of $0.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The capacitance is therefore equivalent to that of a silicon dioxide ($\\mathrm{SiO_2}$) layer of this thickness.\n    $$C_{ox} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{t_{\\mathrm{ox}}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{SiO_2}}\\epsilon_0}{\\mathrm{EOT}}$$\n    Using the given values: $\\mathrm{EOT} = 0.7 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}} = 3.9$, and $\\epsilon_{0} = 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm}$.\n    $$C_{ox} = \\frac{3.9 \\times (8.854187817 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm})}{0.7 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm}} \\approx 4.9330 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$$\n\n3.  **Fixed Charge and Voltage Shift ($Q_{f}'/C_{ox}$)**\n    The fixed charge areal density is given as $Q_{f} = 1.0 \\times 10^{12}$ elementary charges per $\\mathrm{cm^2}$. We convert this to charge density in Coulombs per $\\mathrm{cm^2}$, which we denote $Q_{f}'$.\n    $$Q_{f}' = Q_{f} \\times q = (1.0 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}) \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{C/cm^2}$$\n    Now we calculate the voltage shift due to this positive fixed charge:\n    $$\\frac{Q_{f}'}{C_{ox}} = \\frac{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{C/cm^2}}{4.93304764 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm^2}} \\approx 0.032479\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n    \n4.  **Solving for the Metal Work Function ($\\Phi_{M}$)**\n    We rearrange the full equation to solve for the metal work function potential, $\\phi_{M}$:\n    $$V_{T} = V_{FB} = \\phi_{M} - \\phi_{S} - \\frac{Q_{f}'}{C_{ox}} \\implies \\phi_{M} = V_{T} + \\phi_{S} + \\frac{Q_{f}'}{C_{ox}}$$\n    Substituting the target threshold voltage $V_{T} = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and the calculated values:\n    $$\\phi_{M} = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{V} + 4.61\\,\\mathrm{V} + 0.032479\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 4.992479\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n    The metal work function in electronvolts, $\\Phi_{M}$, is numerically equal to its potential in volts.\n    $$\\Phi_{M} \\approx 4.992479\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n    Rounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n    $$\\Phi_{M} \\approx 4.992\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nThis value for the metal work function will set the threshold voltage of the device to the target value of $0.35\\,\\mathrm{V}$ under the specified conditions.",

Thus:\n$$V_{FB}^{mg} = (\\phi_M - \\phi_{S,midgap} - \\frac{Q_f}{C_{ox}}) - \\Delta\\phi_{MH} - \\Delta\\phi_{HS}$$\nSince the terms in the parenthesis are assumed constant for all stacks, we can define a baseline constant $K = V_{FB}^{mg(0)}$. The shifts in $V_{FB}^{mg}$ relative to this baseline directly measure the dipole contributions.\n\n**3. Applying the Method to the Data**\n\nFirst, calculate the midgap-referenced flatband voltage for each stack:\n- $V_{FB}^{mg(0)} = \\frac{1}{2}(0.36 - 0.46)\\ \\mathrm{V} = -0.05\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_{FB}^{mg(M)} = \\frac{1}{2}(0.16 - 0.66)\\ \\mathrm{V} = -0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_{FB}^{mg(S)} = \\frac{1}{2}(0.46 - 0.36)\\ \\mathrm{V} = +0.05\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_{FB}^{mg(MS)} = \\frac{1}{2}(0.26 - 0.56)\\ \\mathrm{V} = -0.15\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n\nNext, isolate the dipole contributions by comparing each treated stack to the baseline:\n- **Metal/High-$\\kappa$ Dipole ($\\Delta\\phi_{MH}$)**: This is the shift caused by treatment M.\n  $$ \\Delta\\phi_{MH} = V_{FB}^{mg(0)} - V_{FB}^{mg(M)} = (-0.05\\ \\mathrm{V}) - (-0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}) = +0.20\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\n- **High-$\\kappa$/Silicon Dipole ($\\Delta\\phi_{HS}$)**: This is the shift caused by treatment S.\n  $$ \\Delta\\phi_{HS} = V_{FB}^{mg(0)} - V_{FB}^{mg(S)} = (-0.05\\ \\mathrm{V}) - (0.05\\ \\mathrm{V}) = -0.10\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\n\nFinally, check for additivity using the stack with both treatments:\n- Expected shift: $\\Delta\\phi_{MH} + \\Delta\\phi_{HS} = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.10\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n- Expected $V_{FB}^{mg(MS)}$: $V_{FB}^{mg(0)} - (\\Delta\\phi_{MH} + \\Delta\\phi_{HS}) = -0.05\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.10\\ \\mathrm{V} = -0.15\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\nThis matches the measured value, confirming the method and results.\n\n**4. Analysis of Other Options**\n*   **Option B is incorrect** because it uses only one substrate type, making the result susceptible to experimental error and failing to cancel out substrate-related terms cleanly.\n*   **Option C is incorrect** because subtracting the n- and p-type voltages ($V_{FB(n)} - V_{FB(p)} = 2\\phi_F$) isolates the Fermi potential, eliminating the very dipole terms we want to measure.\n*   **Option D is incorrect** because the experimental design does not include varying oxide thickness, which is a prerequisite for that method.\n\nTherefore, Option A describes the correct procedure and yields the correct numerical results.",
