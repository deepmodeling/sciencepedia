            "problem": "A planar Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field–Effect Transistor (MOSFET) exhibits drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) in the subthreshold regime due to two-dimensional electrostatic coupling between the drain and the source–channel barrier. Consider an $n$-channel planar MOSFET with gate length $L = 20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, gate oxide thickness $t_{ox} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and silicon body thickness $t_{si} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. In a subthreshold measurement, the threshold voltage $V_T$ is observed to decrease in magnitude by $80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ as the drain voltage $V_D$ is increased from $0.05\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to $1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}$, with all other terminal biases held fixed and the device operated in subthreshold so that mobile carrier density in the channel is negligible compared to fixed space charge.\n\nStarting from the electrostatic control of the source–channel barrier height by terminal biases, and the definition of threshold as the gate bias required to reach a fixed barrier criterion, derive how the incremental change in $V_T$ relates to the incremental change in $V_D$ in subthreshold operation. Use this to compute the DIBL coefficient, defined as the magnitude of the ratio of the change in $V_T$ to the change in $V_D$ under subthreshold conditions. Express your final answer as a dimensionless number. Round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for two parts: first, a derivation of the relationship between the incremental change in threshold voltage, $V_T$, and the incremental change in drain voltage, $V_D$; second, the calculation of the drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) coefficient from the given data.\n\nIn the subthreshold regime of a MOSFET, the drain current is dominated by diffusion and is exponentially dependent on the height of the potential energy barrier between the source and the channel. Let this barrier height be denoted by $\\phi_B$. The barrier height is a function of the terminal voltages, primarily the gate voltage $V_G$, drain voltage $V_D$, source voltage $V_S$, and body voltage $V_B$. Assuming $V_S$ and $V_B$ are held at a constant potential (e.g., ground), the barrier height is a function $\\phi_B(V_G, V_D)$.\n\nThe total differential of the barrier height is given by:\n$$ d\\phi_B = \\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_G} dV_G + \\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_D} dV_D $$\nThe term $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_G}$ represents the effectiveness of the gate in controlling the barrier height. The term $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_D}$ represents the influence of the drain voltage on the barrier height. In a short-channel device, this drain influence is non-negligible, leading to DIBL. Specifically, an increase in $V_D$ lowers the potential barrier, so $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_D}$ is a negative quantity.\n\nThe threshold voltage, $V_T$, can be defined as the specific gate voltage, $V_G$, required to lower the barrier height to a certain critical value, $\\phi_B^{\\text{crit}}$, which corresponds to a predefined threshold level of drain current. By this definition, as other parameters like $V_D$ change, $V_T$ is the value of $V_G$ that ensures $\\phi_B$ remains constant at $\\phi_B^{\\text{crit}}$.\n\nTherefore, to find the relationship between a change in $V_D$ and the corresponding required change in $V_T$, we set the total change in barrier height to zero, $d\\phi_B = 0$. When we are considering the shift in threshold voltage, the change in gate voltage $dV_G$ is precisely the change in threshold voltage $dV_T$. This gives:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_G} dV_T + \\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_D} dV_D $$\nRearranging this equation, we can solve for the rate of change of $V_T$ with respect to $V_D$:\n$$ \\frac{dV_T}{dV_D} = - \\frac{\\partial \\phi_B / \\partial V_D}{\\partial \\phi_B / \\partial V_G} $$\nThis expression formally derives the relationship between an incremental change in $V_T$ and an incremental change in $V_D$. Since increasing $V_G$ lowers the barrier, $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_G}$ is positive. Since increasing $V_D$ also lowers the barrier, $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_D}$ is negative. Consequently, the ratio $\\frac{dV_T}{dV_D}$ is negative, which confirms that the threshold voltage decreases as the drain voltage increases.\n\nThe problem defines the DIBL coefficient, which we denote as $\\eta_{\\text{DIBL}}$, as the magnitude of this ratio. For finite changes, we can approximate the derivative with the ratio of total changes:\n$$ \\eta_{\\text{DIBL}} = \\left| \\frac{\\Delta V_T}{\\Delta V_D} \\right| $$\nWe are given the data to compute this value.\nThe change in threshold voltage is a decrease of $80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$:\n$$ \\Delta V_T = -80\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -0.080\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nThe change in drain voltage is from $V_{D, \\text{initial}} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to $V_{D, \\text{final}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}$:\n$$ \\Delta V_D = V_{D, \\text{final}} - V_{D, \\text{initial}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.05\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.95\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nNow, we can calculate the DIBL coefficient.

            "solution": "The problem asks for three distinct parts:\n1.  The calculation of the added source series resistance per unit device width due to the Lightly Doped Drain (LDD) extension.\n2.  An explanation of how this added resistance affects the small-signal transconductance, $g_m$.\n3.  An explanation of how LDD engineering influences Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL).\n\nWe will address these in order.\n\n**1. Calculation of Added Source Series Resistance per Unit Width**\n\nThe electrical resistance, $R$, of a uniform rectangular conductor is given by the formula:\n$$R = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the material's resistivity, $L$ is the length of the conductor along which the current flows, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the current flow. For a thin film or slab of material with width $W$ and thickness $t$, the cross-sectional area is $A = W \\cdot t$. The resistance is then:\n$$R = \\rho \\frac{L}{W \\cdot t}$$\nSheet resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$, is a property used for thin films and is defined as the resistivity divided by the thickness:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{sh}} = \\frac{\\rho}{t}$$\nThe units of $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ are Ohms per square ($\\Omega/\\square$), which represents the resistance of a square sheet of the material ($L=W$) regardless of the size of the square.\n\nBy substituting the definition of $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ into the resistance equation, we get:\n$$R = R_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\frac{L}{W}$$\nIn the context of the given problem, the LDD extension on the source side acts as this resistive slab. The current flows along the extension length, so we identify the length $L$ with the physical extension length $L_{\\mathrm{ext}}$. The width of the current path is the device width, $W$. Therefore, the added series resistance at the source, $R_S$, due to this LDD extension is:\n$$R_S = R_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{W}$$\nThe problem asks for the added source series resistance *per unit device width*. We will denote this quantity as $R_{S,W}$. It is obtained by multiplying the resistance $R_S$ by the device width $W$:\n$$R_{S,W} = R_S \\cdot W = \\left(R_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{W}\\right) \\cdot W = R_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\cdot L_{\\mathrm{ext}}$$\nThis quantity has units of resistance times length, typically expressed as $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nWe are given the following values:\nSheet resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{sh}} = 400\\,\\Omega/\\square$.\nLDD extension length, $L_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nFirst, we convert the length to SI units:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nNow, we can compute the added source resistance per unit width:\n$$R_{S,W} = (400\\,\\Omega) \\times (20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 8000 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m} = 8 \\times 10^3 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m} = 8 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Thus, the result is $8.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n**2. Effect of Source Series Resistance on Transconductance ($g_m$)**\n\nThe small-signal transconductance, $g_m$, is a measure of the device's ability to convert an input voltage change into an output current change. The *intrinsic* transconductance, $g_{m0}$, is defined under ideal conditions with no parasitic resistances, as the partial derivative of the drain current $I_D$ with respect to the *internal* gate-to-source voltage $V_{GS,int}$ at a constant drain-to-source voltage $V_{DS}$:\n$$g_{m0} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS,int}} \\right|_{V_{DS}}$$\nWhen a source series resistance $R_S$ is present, the externally applied gate-to-source voltage, $V_{GS,ext}$, is dropped across both the intrinsic gate-source junction and the source resistor. A voltage drop of $I_D R_S$ develops across $R_S$. The internal gate-to-source voltage, which actually controls the MOSFET's channel, is therefore:\n$$V_{GS,int} = V_{GS,ext} - I_D R_S$$\nThe externally measured or *extrinsic* transconductance is defined with respect to the externally applied voltage:\n$$g_m = \\left. \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS,ext}} \\right|_{V_{DS}}$$\nUsing the chain rule, we can relate $g_m$ to $g_{m0}$:\n$$g_m = \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS,int}} \\frac{\\partial V_{GS,int}}{\\partial V_{GS,ext}} = g_{m0} \\frac{\\partial V_{GS,int}}{\\partial V_{GS,ext}}$$\nFrom the voltage relationship, we differentiate $V_{GS,int}$ with respect to $V_{GS,ext}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial V_{GS,int}}{\\partial V_{GS,ext}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{GS,ext}} (V_{GS,ext} - I_D R_S) = 1 - R_S \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS,ext}} = 1 - R_S g_m$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $g_m$:\n$$g_m = g_{m0} (1 - R_S g_m)$$\nSolving for $g_m$:\n$$g_m = g_{m0} - g_m g_{m0} R_S$$\n$$g_m (1 + g_{m0} R_S) = g_{m0}$$\n$$g_m = \\frac{g_{m0}}{1 + g_{m0} R_S}$$\nThis result shows that the presence of a source series resistance $R_S$ (a form of negative feedback known as source degeneration) reduces the externally measured transconductance. Since the LDD extension contributes to $R_S$, it inherently degrades the device's transconductance.\n\n**3. Influence of LDD Engineering on Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL)**\n\nDrain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) is a critical short-channel effect in MOSFETs. It is defined as the reduction of the potential barrier for charge carriers at the source end of the channel due to the influence of the electric field from the drain. In an ideal long-channel device, the drain voltage $V_{DS}$ does not affect the source-channel junction potential, and the gate has full control. In a short-channel device, the depletion region of the drain junction extends far enough to interact with the source junction, effectively lowering the barrier that electrons from the source must surmount to enter the channel. This leads to a decrease in the threshold voltage $V_{th}$ at higher $V_{DS}$ and an increase in subthreshold leakage current.\n\nLDD engineering is a primary technique to combat this effect. An LDD structure consists of a lightly doped region ($n^-$ in an $n$MOSFET) inserted between the heavily doped drain contact ($n^+$) and the channel region. The purpose of this structure is to shape the potential and electric field distribution near the drain.\n\nThe electrostatic mechanism is as follows:\nWhen a high drain voltage $V_{DS}$ is applied, the potential drop from the drain contact to the channel must be accommodated. Without an LDD, this entire voltage drop occurs across the relatively short drain-channel junction, creating a very high peak electric field at the drain end of the channel. This high field penetrates significantly into the channel, causing DIBL.\n\nWith an LDD, the higher resistivity of the lightly doped region causes a significant portion of the drain voltage to drop across the LDD extension itself. This spreads the potential drop over a larger distance. As a result:\n1.  The peak lateral electric field at the drain-channel junction is substantially reduced. This is the primary reason LDDs are used to mitigate hot-carrier injection.\n2.  The LDD region acts as an electrostatic screen, shielding the channel from the full influence of the drain potential. The gradual potential variation across the LDD ensures that the high potential of the drain contact is \"buffered\" before it reaches the channel.\n\nBy reducing the extent to which the drain's electric field penetrates the channel and reaches the source region, the LDD structure directly counteracts the root cause of DIBL. The source-channel potential barrier becomes less sensitive to variations in $V_{DS}$, leading to a more stable threshold voltage and reduced subthreshold leakage current. Thus, LDD engineering is a crucial tool for suppressing DIBL in scaled-down CMOS technologies.",

            "solution": "The goal is to design a biasing protocol that produces distinct signatures for DIBL and GIDL. This requires an understanding of the physical origin and voltage dependencies of each mechanism.\n\n**1. Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL):**\nIn the subthreshold regime ($V_G  V_{\\text{TH}}$, where $V_{\\text{TH}}$ is the threshold voltage), the drain current $I_D$ is primarily due to the diffusion of electrons over a potential barrier between the source and the channel. The current is exponentially dependent on the height of this barrier. The subthreshold current can be expressed as:\n$$I_D \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q(V_G - V_{\\text{TH}})}{nkT}\\right)$$\nwhere $n$ is the subthreshold slope factor, $q$ is the elementary charge, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nDIBL is a short-channel effect where the electric field from the drain terminal penetrates into the channel region and lowers this source-to-channel potential barrier. A higher drain voltage $V_D$ leads to a greater reduction in the barrier height. This effect is mathematically equivalent to a reduction in the threshold voltage $V_{\\text{TH}}$. The change in $V_{\\text{TH}}$ is approximately proportional to $V_D$:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{TH}} \\approx -\\lambda V_D$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the DIBL coefficient.\n\n**Signature of DIBL:**\nThe primary method to observe DIBL is by measuring the transfer characteristics, i.e., the drain current $I_D$ as a function of the gate voltage $V_G$, at different fixed values of $V_D$. A plot of $\\log(I_D)$ versus $V_G$ is standard.\n- When comparing a curve measured at a low $V_D$ (e.g., $V_D \\approx 50\\,\\text{mV}$) with a curve measured at a high $V_D$ (e.g., $V_D$ near the supply voltage), DIBL manifests as a leftward, quasi-horizontal shift of the subthreshold portion of the high-$V_D$ curve. This shift represents the reduction in the apparent $V_{\\text{TH}}$. The subthreshold slope may also degrade (increase), but the dominant effect is the voltage shift.\n- This leakage current mechanism is active whenever $V_D$ is applied and is not contingent on $V_G$ being negative.\n\n**2. Gate-Induced Drain Leakage (GIDL):**\nGIDL is a leakage mechanism caused by band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) in the high-field region at the drain side, specifically in the area where the gate overlaps the n+ drain diffusion. For an $n$-channel MOSFET, this phenomenon becomes significant under a specific bias condition: a high drain voltage ($V_D > 0$) and a low or negative gate voltage ($V_G \\le 0$). This creates a large potential difference between the drain and the gate, $V_{DG} = V_D - V_G$.\n\nThe large electric field bends the energy bands at the silicon surface so sharply that the valence band edge is raised above the conduction band edge. This creates conditions for electrons to tunnel from the valence band (of the p-type body) into the conduction band (landing in the n+ drain). This generates an electron-hole pair. The electron contributes to the drain current $I_D$, and the hole is swept into the body.\n\n**Signature of GIDL:**\n- GIDL current is strongly dependent on the field strength, which is a function of $V_{DG}$. It is therefore most prominent for large positive $V_D$ and negative $V_G$.\n- On a $\\log(I_D)$ versus $V_G$ plot measured at a high, fixed $V_D$, GIDL appears as a distinct leakage component at the low-$V_G$ end of the sweep (i.e., for $V_G \\le 0$). Unlike the subthreshold diffusion current, which decreases as $V_G$ is lowered, GIDL current *increases* as $V_G$ becomes more negative (because this increases $V_{DG}$), creating a characteristic upturn or \"hook\" in the curve.\n- On an output characteristic plot ($\\log(I_D)$ versus $V_D$) at a fixed negative $V_G$, the GIDL current will be negligible at low $V_D$ and will then increase very steeply once $V_D$ is high enough to initiate significant BTBT.\n\n**Proposed Protocol and Differentiation:**\nThe most effective protocol involves measuring the transfer characteristics ($\\log(I_D)$ vs. $V_G$) at a minimum of two $V_D$ levels: one low (e.g., $V_D = 0.05\\,\\text{V}$) and one high (e.g., $V_D$ equal to the device's nominal supply voltage). The $V_G$ sweep must extend to negative values to probe for GIDL.\n\n- If the increase in off-current at high $V_D$ manifests as a leftward shift of the entire subthreshold curve relative to the low-$V_D$ curve, the dominant mechanism is **DIBL**.\n- If the increase in off-current at high $V_D$ manifests primarily as a new current component at $V_G \\le 0$ that is independent of the subthreshold current and causes an upturn in the $\\log(I_D)$ curve, the dominant mechanism is **GIDL**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Sweep $V_G$ over a range that spans from well below threshold ($V_G \\ll V_{\\text{TH}}$) to above threshold at two distinct $V_D$ values: a small $V_D$ near $0\\,\\text{V}$ and a large $V_D$ near the supply.

If the off-current increase is due to GIDL, at large $V_D$ an additional leakage branch appears predominantly for $V_G \\le 0$ (stronger vertical field near the drain-edge), producing an upturn in $\\log(I_D)$ that does not extrapolate from the subthreshold trend; at fixed negative $V_G$, $I_D$ grows steeply with increasing $V_D$.**\n- This option proposes the exact measurement protocol derived above: measuring transfer curves at low and high $V_D$.\n- The description of the DIBL signature (leftward shift representing reduced $V_{\\text{TH}}$) is physically accurate.\n- The description of the GIDL signature (upturn for $V_G \\le 0$ at high $V_D$ due to high field) is also physically accurate.\n- The distinction made for the $I_D$ vs $V_D$ sweep (smooth increase for DIBL vs. steep growth at negative $V_G$ for GIDL) is correct.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Hold $V_D=0\\,\\text{V}$ and sweep $V_G$ across the entire range from negative to above threshold; identify DIBL if off-current increases appreciably with $V_G$ and identify GIDL if off-current increases with more negative $V_G$. Because $V_D=0\\,\\text{V}$, any observed off-current growth is assigned to GIDL.**\n- This protocol is fundamentally flawed. Both DIBL and GIDL are defined by their dependence on a non-zero, typically large, drain voltage $V_D$. At $V_D=0\\,\\text{V}$, there is no drain field to lower the barrier (no DIBL) and no large $V_{DG}$ to cause BTBT at the drain (no GIDL). Essentially no drain current flows under this condition. The statement \"any observed off-current growth is assigned to GIDL\" is nonsensical.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. At $V_G$ well above threshold ($V_G \\gg V_{\\text{TH}}$), sweep $V_D$ from small to large and compare the on-state $\\log(I_D)$–$V_D$ dependence. Attribute any increase in current with $V_D$ to DIBL, and any deviation from linear behavior to GIDL. No $V_G$ sweep in subthreshold is necessary.**\n- This protocol is incorrect because it focuses on the *on-state* ($V_G \\gg V_{\\text{TH}}$), whereas the problem concerns *off-state* current. While DIBL does affect the on-state output characteristics (contributing to a finite output resistance in saturation), its most clear and defining signature is the shift in $V_{\\text{TH}}$ observed in the subthreshold region. GIDL is negligible in the on-state, as the condition for strong BTBT ($V_G \\le 0$ and high $V_D$) is not met. The claim that a subthreshold sweep is unnecessary is false; it is the most critical measurement for this analysis.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Swap the roles of source and drain while holding $|V_D|$ fixed, and sweep $V_G$ only near threshold. Identify DIBL if the off-current is asymmetric under source–drain swapping and identify GIDL if it is symmetric, since GIDL is purely a gate-controlled effect and does not depend on which terminal is the drain.**\n- The reasoning in this option is flawed. GIDL is explicitly a drain-side phenomenon, caused by the high field at the gate-drain overlap. It is not independent of which terminal is the drain. Swapping source and drain moves the location of potential GIDL to the other side of the channel. While a perfectly symmetric device would show symmetric GIDL, real devices often have asymmetries (e.g., in the drain/source extension implants) that would make GIDL asymmetric. More importantly, the statement that GIDL \"does not depend on which terminal is the drain\" is physically false. This protocol does not provide a robust method for distinguishing the two effects.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
