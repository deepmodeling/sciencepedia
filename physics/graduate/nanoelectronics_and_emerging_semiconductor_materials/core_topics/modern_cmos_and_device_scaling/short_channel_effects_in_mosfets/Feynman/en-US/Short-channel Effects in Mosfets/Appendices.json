The tasks are clearly defined, and the data allows for a unique solution via the prescribed method of linearization and fitting.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased technical language. It is free of subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. A solution will be constructed based on the provided information and requirements.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental equation for the threshold voltage, $V_T$, of a MOSFET. At the threshold of inversion, the gate voltage, $V_G = V_T$, must be sufficient to offset the flat-band voltage ($V_{FB}$), establish a surface potential equal to twice the bulk Fermi potential ($\\phi_s$, assumed constant here for a given substrate doping), and support the depletion charge ($Q'_{dep}$) in the semiconductor channel.\n\n$$V_T = V_{FB} + \\phi_s + \\frac{Q'_{dep}}{C_{ox}}$$\n\nHere, $C_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, and $Q'_{dep}$ is the depletion charge per unit gate area that is controlled by the gate.\n\nFor a long-channel device ($L \\to \\infty$), the two-dimensional field effects from the source and drain are negligible. The gate supports the entire depletion charge, $Q'_{dep} = Q_{dep,\\infty}$. The long-channel threshold voltage $V_{T,\\infty}$ is therefore:\n\n$$V_{T,\\infty} = V_{FB} + \\phi_s + \\frac{Q_{dep,\\infty}}{C_{ox}}$$\n\nFrom this, we can express the component of the threshold voltage required to support the depletion charge:\n$$\\frac{Q_{dep,\\infty}}{C_{ox}} = V_{T,\\infty} - (V_{FB} + \\phi_s)$$\n\nIn a short-channel device, the source and drain junctions create their own depletion regions, which terminate some of the electric field lines that would otherwise be terminated by the gate. This \"charge sharing\" means the gate needs to support only a fraction, $f$, of the total depletion charge to achieve threshold. The effective depletion charge per unit area supported by the gate is $Q'_{dep} = f \\cdot Q_{dep,\\infty}$.\n\nThe short-channel threshold voltage $V_T(L)$ is then:\n$$V_T(L) = V_{FB} + \\phi_s + f \\frac{Q_{dep,\\infty}}{C_{ox}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $Q_{dep,\\infty}/C_{ox}$:\n$$V_T(L) = V_{FB} + \\phi_s + f (V_{T,\\infty} - (V_{FB} + \\phi_s))$$\n$$V_T(L) = (1-f)(V_{FB} + \\phi_s) + f V_{T,\\infty}$$\n\nThe threshold voltage shift, $\\Delta V_T = V_{T,\\infty} - V_T(L)$, is:\n$$\\Delta V_T = V_{T,\\infty} - [(1-f)(V_{FB} + \\phi_s) + f V_{T,\\infty}]$$\n$$\\Delta V_T = (1-f) V_{T,\\infty} - (1-f)(V_{FB} + \\phi_s)$$\n$$\\Delta V_T = (1-f)[V_{T,\\infty} - (V_{FB} + \\phi_s)]$$\n\nLet's define a constant $A = V_{T,\\infty} - (V_{FB} + \\phi_s)$, which represents the portion of the long-channel threshold voltage that supports the depletion charge.\n$$\\Delta V_T = (1-f)A$$\n\nThe problem requires constructing a minimal two-parameter model based on an effective encroachment length $L_e$. We propose a model for the charge-sharing factor $f$ that leads to a linearizable form and is consistent with the idea of encroachment. A suitable model expresses $f$ as the ratio of the gate-defined length $L$ to an effective length that includes the encroachment from both source and drain, $L+2L_e$:\n$$f = \\frac{L}{L+2L_e}$$\nThis gives the factor $(1-f)$:\n$$1-f = 1 - \\frac{L}{L+2L_e} = \\frac{L+2L_e-L}{L+2L_e} = \\frac{2L_e}{L+2L_e}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta V_T$:\n$$\\Delta V_T = \\frac{2L_e A}{L+2L_e}$$\n\nThis is the analytical dependence of $\\Delta V_T$ on $L$. The two parameters of this model are the effective encroachment length $L_e$ and the body-effect parameter $A$. To extract these parameters, we linearize the equation. By taking the reciprocal, we get:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\Delta V_T} = \\frac{L+2L_e}{2L_e A} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2L_e A}\\right) L + \\frac{2L_e}{2L_e A}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\Delta V_T} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2L_e A}\\right) L + \\frac{1}{A}$$\n\nThis equation is in the linear form $y = mx+c$, where:\n- $y = 1/\\Delta V_T$\n- $x = L$\n- The slope is $m = \\frac{1}{2L_e A}$\n- The y-intercept is $c = \\frac{1}{A}$\n\nFrom the parameters of a linear fit ($m$ and $c$), we can extract $L_e$ and $A$. From the intercept, $A = 1/c$. Substituting this into the slope equation gives $m = 1/(2L_e (1/c)) = c/(2L_e)$. Rearranging for $L_e$:\n$$L_e = \\frac{c}{2m}$$\n\nNow, we apply this method to the given data. First, we compute the values for the linear fit, $(L, 1/\\Delta V_T)$, using the provided $V_{T,\\infty} = 0.420\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The length $L$ will be in nanometers.\n\n| $L$ (nm) | $V_T$ (V) | $\\Delta V_T = V_{T,\\infty} - V_T$ (V) | $1/\\Delta V_T$ (V$^{-1}$) |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $200$ | $0.400$ | $0.020$ | $50.0$ |\n| $120$ | $0.390$ | $0.030$ | $33.333...$ |\n| $80$ | $0.380$ | $0.040$ | $25.0$ |\n| $60$ | $0.372$ | $0.048$ | $20.833...$ |\n| $40$ | $0.360$ | $0.060$ | $16.666...$ |\n| $30$ | $0.351429$ | $0.068571$ | $14.583...$ |\n\nWe perform a linear regression on the dataset $(L, 1/\\Delta V_T)$.\n- Number of points, $N=6$.\n- Sum of $x$ ($L$): $\\sum L_i = 200+120+80+60+40+30 = 530$.\n- Sum of $y$ ($1/\\Delta V_T$): $\\sum y_i \\approx 50.0 + 33.333 + 25.0 + 20.833 + 16.667 + 14.583 = 160.416$.\n- Sum of $x^2$ ($\\sum L_i^2$): $200^2+120^2+80^2+60^2+40^2+30^2 = 40000+14400+6400+3600+1600+900 = 66900$.\n- Sum of $xy$ ($\\sum L_i y_i$): $200(50) + 120(100/3) + 80(25) + 60(125/6) + 40(50/3) + 30(102.08/7) \\approx 10000+4000+2000+1250+666.67+437.5 = 18354.17$.\n\nThe slope $m$ and intercept $c$ are calculated as:\n$$m = \\frac{N \\sum(L_i y_i) - (\\sum L_i)(\\sum y_i)}{N \\sum(L_i^2) - (\\sum L_i)^2} = \\frac{6(18354.17) - (530)(160.416)}{6(66900) - (530)^2} = \\frac{110125 - 85020.5}{401400 - 280900} = \\frac{25104.5}{120500} \\approx 0.208336\\,\\mathrm{V^{-1}nm^{-1}}$$\n$$c = \\frac{\\sum y_i - m \\sum L_i}{N} = \\frac{160.416 - (0.208336)(530)}{6} = \\frac{160.416 - 110.418}{6} = \\frac{50.0}{6} \\approx 8.333\\,\\mathrm{V^{-1}}$$\nThe exact values suggested by the fit are $m=5/24$ and $c=25/3$. Let's use these values for precision.\n$m = 5/24 \\approx 0.208333...$\n$c = 25/3 \\approx 8.33333...$\n\nNow we compute the effective encroachment length $L_e$:\n$$L_e = \\frac{c}{2m} = \\frac{25/3}{2 \\times (5/24)} = \\frac{25/3}{10/24} = \\frac{25}{3} \\times \\frac{24}{10} = \\frac{25 \\times 8}{10} = \\frac{200}{10} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\n\nThe extracted effective encroachment length is exactly $20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Rounding to three significant figures gives $20.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n### Physical Meaning of $L_e$\nThe parameter $L_e$ represents an effective length that quantifies the extent of two-dimensional electrostatic charge sharing at the source and drain ends of the MOSFET channel. It is not a directly measurable physical dimension but rather a parameter in a simplified model that captures the complex physics of how the source/drain fields encroach upon the channel region. A larger $L_e$ signifies a greater loss of gate control over the channel charge, leading to more severe short-channel effects like $V_T$ roll-off.\nThe magnitude of $L_e$ is determined by the device's structural and material properties:\n1.  **Junction Depth ($r_j$) and Body/Channel Thickness ($t_{body}$):** Deeper source/drain junctions and thicker semiconductor bodies allow field lines to spread further, increasing $L_e$. Conversely, ultrathin bodies (as in this problem) help confine the fields and reduce $L_e$.\n2.  **Gate Oxide Thickness ($t_{ox}$):** A thinner gate oxide enhances the gate's electrostatic control over the channel, thus reducing the relative influence of the source/drain and decreasing $L_e$.\n3.  **Permittivities ($\\epsilon_{semi}$, $\\epsilon_{ox}$):** The ratio of the semiconductor permittivity to the gate dielectric permittivity influences the distribution of electric fields. A high-permittivity (high-k) dielectric like HfO$_2$ increases the gate's coupling to the channel ($\\epsilon_{ox}$ is large), which helps to suppress short-channel effects and leads to a smaller value of $L_e$ compared to a conventional SiO$_2$ dielectric.\n\nIn essence, $L_e$ is a compact parameter that models how device scaling and material choices impact the gate's ability to control the channel.",

Drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) is a fundamental short-channel effect in MOSFETs. The description of its origin—two-dimensional electrostatic coupling between the drain and the source-channel barrier—is accurate. The provided device dimensions are realistic for a modern scaled transistor where such effects are prominent.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: The problem is directly relevant to short-channel effects in MOSFETs and is fully formalizable within the framework of semiconductor device physics.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is self-contained and consistent. It provides the experimental data ($\\Delta V_T$ and $\\Delta V_D$) needed to calculate the DIBL coefficient as defined. The device dimensions ($L$, $t_{ox}$, $t_{si}$) serve as context to establish that the transistor is in the short-channel regime, but they are not required for the numerical calculation, which is based on the provided voltage changes. This does not constitute a flaw.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The physical parameters and observed voltage shifts are within realistic bounds for a nanoscale planar MOSFET. A DIBL value of $80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ over this drain voltage range is plausible for a $20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ device.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-posed. It clearly defines the DIBL coefficient and provides the necessary data for its calculation. The request to first derive the relationship and then compute the value is a logical structure for a physics problem.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem is not trivial. It requires an understanding of the physical definition of threshold voltage in the subthreshold regime and its relationship to the electrostatic potential barrier. While the final calculation is straightforward, the conceptual derivation is a core part of the question.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, a derivation of the relationship between the incremental change in threshold voltage, $V_T$, and the incremental change in drain voltage, $V_D$; second, the calculation of the drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) coefficient from the given data.\n\nIn the subthreshold regime of a MOSFET, the drain current is dominated by diffusion and is exponentially dependent on the height of the potential energy barrier between the source and the channel. Let this barrier height be denoted by $\\phi_B$. The barrier height is a function of the terminal voltages, primarily the gate voltage $V_G$, drain voltage $V_D$, source voltage $V_S$, and body voltage $V_B$. Assuming $V_S$ and $V_B$ are held at a constant potential (e.g., ground), the barrier height is a function $\\phi_B(V_G, V_D)$.\n\nThe total differential of the barrier height is given by:\n$$ d\\phi_B = \\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_G} dV_G + \\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_D} dV_D $$\nThe term $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_G}$ represents the effectiveness of the gate in controlling the barrier height. The term $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_D}$ represents the influence of the drain voltage on the barrier height. In a short-channel device, this drain influence is non-negligible, leading to DIBL. Specifically, an increase in $V_D$ lowers the potential barrier, so $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_D}$ is a negative quantity.\n\nThe threshold voltage, $V_T$, can be defined as the specific gate voltage, $V_G$, required to lower the barrier height to a certain critical value, $\\phi_B^{\\text{crit}}$, which corresponds to a predefined threshold level of drain current. By this definition, as other parameters like $V_D$ change, $V_T$ is the value of $V_G$ that ensures $\\phi_B$ remains constant at $\\phi_B^{\\text{crit}}$.\n\nTherefore, to find the relationship between a change in $V_D$ and the corresponding required change in $V_T$, we set the total change in barrier height to zero, $d\\phi_B = 0$. When we are considering the shift in threshold voltage, the change in gate voltage $dV_G$ is precisely the change in threshold voltage $dV_T$. This gives:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_G} dV_T + \\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_D} dV_D $$\nRearranging this equation, we can solve for the rate of change of $V_T$ with respect to $V_D$:\n$$ \\frac{dV_T}{dV_D} = - \\frac{\\partial \\phi_B / \\partial V_D}{\\partial \\phi_B / \\partial V_G} $$\nThis expression formally derives the relationship between an incremental change in $V_T$ and an incremental change in $V_D$. Since increasing $V_G$ lowers the barrier, $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_G}$ is positive. Since increasing $V_D$ also lowers the barrier, $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_B}{\\partial V_D}$ is negative. Consequently, the ratio $\\frac{dV_T}{dV_D}$ is negative, which confirms that the threshold voltage decreases as the drain voltage increases.\n\nThe problem defines the DIBL coefficient, which we denote as $\\eta_{\\text{DIBL}}$, as the magnitude of this ratio. For finite changes, we can approximate the derivative with the ratio of total changes:\n$$ \\eta_{\\text{DIBL}} = \\left| \\frac{\\Delta V_T}{\\Delta V_D} \\right| $$\nWe are given the data to compute this value.\nThe change in threshold voltage is a decrease of $80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$:\n$$ \\Delta V_T = -80\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -0.080\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nThe change in drain voltage is from $V_{D, \\text{initial}} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to $V_{D, \\text{final}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}$:\n$$ \\Delta V_D = V_{D, \\text{final}} - V_{D, \\text{initial}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.05\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.95\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nNow, we can calculate the DIBL coefficient. The units are typically expressed as $\\mathrm{mV/V}$, but the problem asks for a dimensionless number.\n$$ \\eta_{\\text{DIBL}} = \\left| \\frac{-0.080\\,\\mathrm{V}}{0.95\\,\\mathrm{V}} \\right| = \\frac{0.080}{0.95} $$\n$$ \\eta_{\\text{DIBL}} \\approx 0.084210526... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\eta_{\\text{DIBL}} = 0.08421 $$\nThis dimensionless value corresponds to a DIBL of $84.21\\,\\mathrm{mV/V}$, which is a plausible value for a short-channel planar MOSFET with the given dimensions. The device parameters $L$, $t_{ox}$, and $t_{si}$ provide the physical context for why such a significant DIBL effect is observed but are not used in the final calculation, which is based on the provided experimental measurements.",

DIBL and GIDL are well-documented short-channel effects in MOSFETs. The underlying theoretical framework (Poisson's equation, drift-diffusion, BTBT/WKB) constitutes the standard model for analyzing these phenomena. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The task is to design an experimental characterization protocol to differentiate between two physical mechanisms based on their distinct electrical signatures.

The described effects are real and routinely observed in modern transistors.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete for its intended conceptual purpose. No flaws are identified. Therefore, the problem is **VALID**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe goal is to design a biasing protocol that produces distinct signatures for DIBL and GIDL. This requires an understanding of the physical origin and voltage dependencies of each mechanism.\n\n**1. Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL):**\nIn the subthreshold regime ($V_G < V_T$, where $V_T$ is the threshold voltage), the drain current $I_D$ is primarily due to the diffusion of electrons over a potential barrier between the source and the channel. The current is exponentially dependent on the height of this barrier. The subthreshold current can be expressed as:\n$$I_D \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q(V_G - V_T)}{nkT}\\right)$$\nwhere $n$ is the subthreshold slope factor, $q$ is the elementary charge, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nDIBL is a short-channel effect where the electric field from the drain terminal penetrates into the channel region and lowers this source-to-channel potential barrier. A higher drain voltage $V_D$ leads to a greater reduction in the barrier height. This effect is mathematically equivalent to a reduction in the threshold voltage $V_T$. The change in $V_T$ is approximately proportional to $V_D$:\n$$\\Delta V_T \\approx -\\lambda V_D$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the DIBL coefficient.\n\n**Signature of DIBL:**\nThe primary method to observe DIBL is by measuring the transfer characteristics, i.e., the drain current $I_D$ as a function of the gate voltage $V_G$, at different fixed values of $V_D$. A plot of $\\log(I_D)$ versus $V_G$ is standard.\n- When comparing a curve measured at a low $V_D$ (e.g., $V_D \\approx 50\\,\\text{mV}$) with a curve measured at a high $V_D$ (e.g., $V_D$ near the supply voltage), DIBL manifests as a leftward, quasi-horizontal shift of the subthreshold portion of the high-$V_D$ curve. This shift represents the reduction in the apparent $V_T$. The subthreshold slope may also degrade (increase), but the dominant effect is the voltage shift.\n- This leakage current mechanism is active whenever $V_D$ is applied and is not contingent on $V_G$ being negative.\n\n**2. Gate-Induced Drain Leakage (GIDL):**\nGIDL is a leakage mechanism caused by band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) in the high-field region at the drain side, specifically in the area where the gate overlaps the n+ drain diffusion. For an $n$-channel MOSFET, this phenomenon becomes significant under a specific bias condition: a high drain voltage ($V_D > 0$) and a low or negative gate voltage ($V_G \\le 0$). This creates a large potential difference between the drain and the gate, $V_{DG} = V_D - V_G$.\n\nThe large electric field bends the energy bands at the silicon surface so sharply that the valence band edge is raised above the conduction band edge. This creates conditions for electrons to tunnel from the valence band (of the p-type body) into the conduction band (landing in the n+ drain). This generates an electron-hole pair. The electron contributes to the drain current $I_D$, and the hole is swept into the body.\n\n**Signature of GIDL:**\n- GIDL current is strongly dependent on the field strength, which is a function of $V_{DG}$. It is therefore most prominent for large positive $V_D$ and negative $V_G$.\n- On a $\\log(I_D)$ versus $V_G$ plot measured at a high, fixed $V_D$, GIDL appears as a distinct leakage component at the low-$V_G$ end of the sweep (i.e., for $V_G \\le 0$). Unlike the subthreshold diffusion current, which decreases as $V_G$ is lowered, GIDL current *increases* as $V_G$ becomes more negative (because this increases $V_{DG}$), creating a characteristic upturn or \"hook\" in the curve.\n- On an output characteristic plot ($\\log(I_D)$ versus $V_D$) at a fixed negative $V_G$, the GIDL current will be negligible at low $V_D$ and will then increase very steeply once $V_D$ is high enough to initiate significant BTBT.\n\n**Proposed Protocol and Differentiation:**\nThe most effective protocol involves measuring the transfer characteristics ($\\log(I_D)$ vs. $V_G$) at a minimum of two $V_D$ levels: one low (e.g., $V_D = 0.05\\,\\text{V}$) and one high (e.g., $V_D$ equal to the device's nominal supply voltage). The $V_G$ sweep must extend to negative values to probe for GIDL.\n\n- If the increase in off-current at high $V_D$ manifests as a leftward shift of the entire subthreshold curve relative to the low-$V_D$ curve, the dominant mechanism is **DIBL**.\n- If the increase in off-current at high $V_D$ manifests primarily as a new current component at $V_G \\le 0$ that is independent of the subthreshold current and causes an upturn in the $\\log(I_D)$ curve, the dominant mechanism is **GIDL**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Sweep $V_G$ over a range that spans from well below threshold ($V_G \\ll V_T$) to above threshold at two distinct $V_D$ values: a small $V_D$ near $0\\,\\text{V}$ and a large $V_D$ near the supply. Record $\\log(I_D)$ versus $V_G$ at each $V_D$. In addition, at fixed subthreshold $V_G$ (slightly below $V_T$), sweep $V_D$ from small to large values. Expected signatures: If the off-current increase is due to DIBL, the $\\log(I_D)$–$V_G$ curve at large $V_D$ exhibits a primarily horizontal leftward shift (reduced apparent $V_T$) relative to the small-$V_D$ curve in the subthreshold region, with comparable subthreshold slope, and the $I_D$ versus $V_D$ at fixed subthreshold $V_G$ increases smoothly without requiring $V_G<0$. If the off-current increase is due to GIDL, at large $V_D$ an additional leakage branch appears predominantly for $V_G \\le 0$ (stronger vertical field near the drain-edge), producing an upturn in $\\log(I_D)$ that does not extrapolate from the subthreshold trend; at fixed negative $V_G$, $I_D$ grows steeply with increasing $V_D$.**\n- This option proposes the exact measurement protocol derived above: measuring transfer curves at low and high $V_D$.\n- The description of the DIBL signature (leftward shift representing reduced $V_T$) is physically accurate.\n- The description of the GIDL signature (upturn for $V_G \\le 0$ at high $V_D$ due to high field) is also physically accurate.\n- The distinction made for the $I_D$ vs $V_D$ sweep (smooth increase for DIBL vs. steep growth at negative $V_G$ for GIDL) is correct.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Hold $V_D=0\\,\\text{V}$ and sweep $V_G$ across the entire range from negative to above threshold; identify DIBL if off-current increases appreciably with $V_G$ and identify GIDL if off-current increases with more negative $V_G$. Because $V_D=0\\,\\text{V}$, any observed off-current growth is assigned to GIDL.**\n- This protocol is fundamentally flawed. Both DIBL and GIDL are defined by their dependence on a non-zero, typically large, drain voltage $V_D$. At $V_D=0\\,\\text{V}$, there is no drain field to lower the barrier (no DIBL) and no large $V_{DG}$ to cause BTBT at the drain (no GIDL). Essentially no drain current flows under this condition. The statement \"any observed off-current growth is assigned to GIDL\" is nonsensical.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. At $V_G$ well above threshold ($V_G \\gg V_T$), sweep $V_D$ from small to large and compare the on-state $\\log(I_D)$–$V_D$ dependence. Attribute any increase in current with $V_D$ to DIBL, and any deviation from linear behavior to GIDL. No $V_G$ sweep in subthreshold is necessary.**\n- This protocol is incorrect because it focuses on the *on-state* ($V_G \\gg V_T$), whereas the problem concerns *off-state* current. While DIBL does affect the on-state output characteristics (contributing to a finite output resistance in saturation), its most clear and defining signature is the shift in $V_T$ observed in the subthreshold region. GIDL is negligible in the on-state, as the condition for strong BTBT ($V_G \\le 0$ and high $V_D$) is not met. The claim that a subthreshold sweep is unnecessary is false; it is the most critical measurement for this analysis.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Swap the roles of source and drain while holding $|V_D|$ fixed, and sweep $V_G$ only near threshold. Identify DIBL if the off-current is asymmetric under source–drain swapping and identify GIDL if it is symmetric, since GIDL is purely a gate-controlled effect and does not depend on which terminal is the drain.**\n- The reasoning in this option is flawed. GIDL is explicitly a drain-side phenomenon, caused by the high field at the gate-drain overlap. It is not independent of which terminal is the drain. Swapping source and drain moves the location of potential GIDL to the other side of the channel. While a perfectly symmetric device would show symmetric GIDL, real devices often have asymmetries (e.g., in the drain/source extension implants) that would make GIDL asymmetric. More importantly, the statement that GIDL \"does not depend on which terminal is the drain\" is physically false. This protocol does not provide a robust method for distinguishing the two effects.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
