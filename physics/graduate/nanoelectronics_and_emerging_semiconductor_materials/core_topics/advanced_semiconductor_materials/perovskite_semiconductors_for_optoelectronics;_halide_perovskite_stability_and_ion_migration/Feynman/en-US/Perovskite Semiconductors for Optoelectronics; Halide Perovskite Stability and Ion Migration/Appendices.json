            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of an ionic conductivity dominance metric, $R$, for a methylammonium lead iodide ($\\text{MAPbI}_3$) perovskite crystal. The solution is a multi-step process that begins with determining defect concentrations from statistical mechanics, followed by calculating ionic conductivities using the Einstein relation, and finally computing the specified ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation and Calculation of Equilibrium Vacancy Concentration**\n\nThe problem states that we must start from the first principles of equilibrium statistical mechanics in the dilute, non-interacting point-defect limit. The equilibrium concentration of vacancies is determined by minimizing the Gibbs free energy of defect formation, $\\Delta G_f$. For a given sublattice $i$, the formation of $n_i$ vacancies on $N_{sites,i}$ available lattice sites is described by:\n$$\n\\Delta G_f(n_i) = \\Delta H_f - T \\Delta S_f\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta H_f$ is the change in enthalpy, which in the non-interacting limit is $n_i E_{f,i}$, where $E_{f,i}$ is the formation energy of a single vacancy. The entropy change $\\Delta S_f$ is dominated by the configurational entropy, $S_{conf}$, which accounts for the number of ways to arrange the defects on the lattice.\n$$\nS_{conf}(n_i) = k_B \\ln(\\Omega) = k_B \\ln \\left( \\binom{N_{sites,i}}{n_i} \\right) = k_B \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_{sites,i}!}{n_i! (N_{sites,i}-n_i)!} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The Gibbs free energy is thus:\n$$\n\\Delta G_f(n_i) = n_i E_{f,i} - k_B T \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_{sites,i}!}{n_i! (N_{sites,i}-n_i)!} \\right)\n$$\nTo find the equilibrium number of vacancies $n_i$, we minimize $\\Delta G_f$ with respect to $n_i$ by setting the partial derivative to zero: $\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta G_f)}{\\partial n_i} = 0$. Using Stirling's approximation, $\\ln(x!) \\approx x \\ln(x) - x$ for large $x$, the derivative of the entropy term is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S_{conf}}{\\partial n_i} \\approx k_B \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_i} \\left[ -n_i \\ln(n_i) - (N_{sites,i}-n_i)\\ln(N_{sites,i}-n_i) \\right] = k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{sites,i}-n_i}{n_i}\\right)\n$$\nThe minimization condition becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta G_f)}{\\partial n_i} = E_{f,i} - T \\frac{\\partial S_{conf}}{\\partial n_i} = E_{f,i} - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{sites,i}-n_i}{n_i}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSolving for the fractional occupancy $c_i = n_i/N_{sites,i}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{f,i}}{k_B T} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-c_i}{c_i}\\right) \\implies \\frac{c_i}{1-c_i} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f,i}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nIn the specified dilute limit ($n_i \\ll N_{sites,i}$, so $c_i \\ll 1$), we can approximate $1-c_i \\approx 1$. The fractional concentration of vacancies of type $i$ is then:\n$$\nc_i = \\frac{n_i}{N_{sites,i}} \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f,i}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe volumetric concentration of vacancies, denoted by $n_{V,i}$, is the product of the fractional concentration and the volumetric density of sites, $N'_{sites,i}$:\n$$\nn_{V,i} = N'_{sites,i} \\cdot c_i = N'_{sites,i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f,i}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe site density $N'_{sites,i}$ is the sublattice multiplicity $M_i$ divided by the volume of the primitive cell, $V_{cell} = a^3$.\n$$\nn_{V,i} = \\frac{M_i}{a^3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f,i}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requests the numerical value for the iodide vacancy concentration, $n_{V,\\mathrm{I}}$. First, we calculate the thermal energy at $T=300\\ \\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\nk_B T \\approx (8.617 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{eV/K}) \\times (300\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.02585\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThe primitive cell volume is $V_{cell} = a^3 = (6.31 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m})^3 \\approx 2.512 \\times 10^{-28}\\ \\mathrm{m^3}$.\nThe parameters for iodide vacancies are $M_{\\mathrm{I}} = 3$ and $E_{f}(\\mathrm{V_I}) = 0.60\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n$$\nn_{V,\\mathrm{I}} = \\frac{3}{2.512 \\times 10^{-28}\\ \\mathrm{m^3}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.60\\ \\mathrm{eV}}{0.02585\\ \\mathrm{eV}}\\right) \\approx (1.194 \\times 10^{28}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\exp(-23.21) \\approx 8.99 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculation of Individual Ionic Conductivities**\n\nThe ionic conductivity, $\\sigma_i$, for a species $i$ is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_i = n_{V,i} |q_i| \\mu_i\n$$\nwhere $n_{V,i}$ is the volumetric vacancy concentration, $|q_i|$ is the magnitude of the charge of the migrating species, and $\\mu_i$ is its mobility. The problem states that each vacancy has a charge magnitude of $|z|=1$, so $|q_i| = e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThe Nernst-Einstein relation connects mobility $\\mu_i$ to the diffusion coefficient $D_i$:\n$$\n\\mu_i = \\frac{|q_i| D_i}{k_B T} = \\frac{e D_i}{k_B T}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the conductivity equation yields:\n$$\n\\sigma_i = n_{V,i} e \\left( \\frac{e D_i}{k_B T} \\right) = \\frac{n_{V,i} e^2 D_i}{k_B T}\n$$\nThe diffusion coefficient is given in Arrhenius form: $D_i = D_{0,i} \\exp(-E_{m,i}/k_B T)$. Substituting the expressions for both $n_{V,i}$ and $D_i$:\n$$\n\\sigma_i = \\left( \\frac{M_i}{a^3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f,i}}{k_B T}\\right) \\right) \\frac{e^2}{k_B T} \\left( D_{0,i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{m,i}}{k_B T}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nCombining the exponential terms, we find that the conductivity is governed by a total activation energy, $E_{act,i} = E_{f,i} + E_{m,i}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_i = \\frac{e^2 M_i D_{0,i}}{a^3 k_B T} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{act,i}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Computation of the Dominance Metric R**\n\nThe dominance metric $R$ is defined as the ratio of the iodide vacancy conductivity to the total ionic conductivity:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{V_I}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{V_I}} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{V_{MA}}} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{V_{Pb}}}}\n$$\nWhen we substitute the expression for $\\sigma_i$, the common pre-factor $C = e^2 / (a^3 k_B T)$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\nR = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{I}} D_{0,\\mathrm{I}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{act,\\mathrm{I}}}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\sum_{j \\in \\{\\mathrm{I, MA, Pb}\\}} M_j D_{0,j} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{act,j}}{k_B T}\\right)}\n$$\nWe now calculate the activation energies $E_{act,i} = E_{f,i} + E_{m,i}$ for each vacancy type:\n-   $V_{\\mathrm{I}}$: $E_{act,\\mathrm{I}} = 0.60\\ \\mathrm{eV} + 0.30\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 0.90\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n-   $V_{\\mathrm{MA}}$: $E_{act,\\mathrm{MA}} = 0.80\\ \\mathrm{eV} + 0.70\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 1.50\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n-   $V_{\\mathrm{Pb}}$: $E_{act,\\mathrm{Pb}} = 1.20\\ \\mathrm{eV} + 0.90\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 2.10\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n\nLet's compute the terms $S_j = M_j D_{0,j} \\exp(-E_{act,j}/k_B T)$ in the ratio using $k_B T \\approx 0.02585\\ \\mathrm{eV}$:\n-   $S_{\\mathrm{I}} = (3) (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.90}{0.02585}\\right) \\approx (3.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\exp(-34.816) \\approx 2.50 \\times 10^{-21}$\n-   $S_{\\mathrm{MA}} = (1) (1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1.50}{0.02585}\\right) \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{-7}) \\exp(-58.027) \\approx 6.19 \\times 10^{-33}$\n-   $S_{\\mathrm{Pb}} = (1) (1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2.10}{0.02585}\\right) \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{-7}) \\exp(-81.238) \\approx 3.82 \\times 10^{-43}$\n\nThe units of $S_j$ are $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, which will cancel in the ratio. The sum is dominated by the iodide term:\n$$\n\\sum_j S_j = S_{\\mathrm{I}} + S_{\\mathrm{MA}} + S_{\\mathrm{Pb}} \\approx 2.50 \\times 10^{-21} + 6.19 \\times 10^{-33} + 3.82 \\times 10^{-43}\n$$\nThe contributions from $V_{\\mathrm{MA}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{Pb}}$ are approximately $12$ and $22$ orders of magnitude smaller than the contribution from $V_{\\mathrm{I}}$, respectively. They are thus negligible.\n$$\nR = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{I}}}{\\sum_j S_j} = \\frac{2.50 \\times 10^{-21}}{2.50 \\times 10^{-21} + 6.19 \\times 10^{-33} + 3.82 \\times 10^{-43}}\n$$\nThis value is extremely close to $1$. To be precise:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{MA}}}{S_{\\mathrm{I}}} + \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{Pb}}}{S_{\\mathrm{I}}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{6.19 \\times 10^{-33}}{2.50 \\times 10^{-21}} + \\frac{3.82 \\times 10^{-43}}{2.50 \\times 10^{-21}}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 2.48 \\times 10^{-12}}\n$$\nThis yields $R \\approx 0.99999999999752$.

The total flux is the linear superposition of the flux due to diffusion, $J_{\\text{diff}}$, and the flux due to drift in the electric field, $J_{\\text{drift}}$.\nAccording to Fick's first law, the diffusion flux is proportional to the negative gradient of the concentration:\n$$ J_{\\text{diff}}(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial c(x,t)}{\\partial x} $$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.

The continuity equation, given as $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0$, simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\nThis implies that the steady-state flux $J(x)$ is constant with respect to position $x$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the contacts at $x=0$ and $x=L$ are blocking for the ionic species, meaning the ionic number flux is zero at these boundaries: $J(0) = 0$ and $J(L) = 0$.

Solving for $c(x)$ by exponentiating both sides:\n$$ c(x) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu E}{D} x + C_1\\right) = C \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu E}{D} x\\right) $$\nwhere $C = \\exp(C_1)$ is a new constant.\n\nTo express the solution in the desired terms, we use the Einstein relation, $D = \\frac{\\mu k_{B} T}{q}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Substituting this into the exponent's prefactor:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu E}{D} = \\frac{\\mu E}{\\left(\\frac{\\mu k_{B} T}{q}\\right)} = \\frac{q E}{k_{B} T} $$\nThe concentration profile thus takes the form of a Boltzmann distribution:\n$$ c(x) = C \\exp\\left(\\frac{q E x}{k_{B} T}\\right) $$\n\nThe constant $C$ is determined by the conservation of the total number of ions, which is captured by the given average concentration $\\bar{c}$. The average concentration is defined as:\n$$ \\bar{c} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} c(x) dx $$\nSubstituting our expression for $c(x)$:\n$$ \\bar{c} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} C \\exp\\left(\\frac{q E x}{k_{B} T}\\right) dx $$\nWe can pull the constant $C$ out of the integral:\n$$ \\bar{c} = \\frac{C}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\exp\\left(\\frac{q E x}{k_{B} T}\\right) dx $$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} \\exp\\left(\\frac{q E x}{k_{B} T}\\right) dx = \\left[ \\frac{k_{B} T}{q E} \\exp\\left(\\frac{q E x}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{L} $$\n$$ = \\frac{k_{B} T}{q E} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{q E L}{k_{B} T}\\right) - \\exp(0) \\right) = \\frac{k_{B} T}{q E} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{q E L}{k_{B} T}\\right) - 1 \\right) $$\nNow, substitute this back into the equation for $\\bar{c}$:\n$$ \\bar{c} = \\frac{C}{L} \\left( \\frac{k_{B} T}{q E} \\right) \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{q E L}{k_{B} T}\\right) - 1 \\right) $$\nSolving for the constant $C$:\n$$ C = \\bar{c} \\frac{L q E}{k_{B} T} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{q E L}{k_{B} T}\\right) - 1} $$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $C$ back into the equation for $c(x)$ to obtain the final closed-form solution:\n$$ c(x) = \\left( \\bar{c} \\frac{L q E}{k_{B} T} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{q E L}{k_{B} T}\\right) - 1} \\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{q E x}{k_{B} T}\\right) $$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$ c(x) = \\bar{c} \\left( \\frac{q E L}{k_{B} T} \\right) \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{q E x}{k_{B} T}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{q E L}{k_{B} T}\\right) - 1} $$\nThis expression gives the steady-state concentration profile $c(x)$ in terms of the average concentration $\\bar{c}$, slab thickness $L$, electric field $E$, temperature $T$, ion charge magnitude $q$, and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$.",
