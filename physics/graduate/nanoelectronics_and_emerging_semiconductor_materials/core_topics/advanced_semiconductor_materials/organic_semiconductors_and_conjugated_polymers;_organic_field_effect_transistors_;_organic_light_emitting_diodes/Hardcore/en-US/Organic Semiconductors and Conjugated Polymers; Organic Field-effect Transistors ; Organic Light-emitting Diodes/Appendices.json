This practice provides a computational framework to explore this fundamental concept using a tight-binding (Hückel) model, which is a cornerstone for understanding $\\pi$-conjugated systems. By constructing the Hamiltonian for linear oligomers of increasing length and extrapolating to the infinite-chain limit, you will directly visualize how the discrete molecular orbitals of small molecules coalesce into the valence and conduction bands of a polymer, and how bond alternation opens a finite band gap, $E_{\\mathrm{gap}}$, a critical parameter for any semiconductor .",

            "problem": "You are asked to formulate and implement a nearest-neighbor tight-binding (Hückel) calculation for linear conjugated oligomers, compute the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) energies versus chain length, and extrapolate the HOMO-LUMO energy gap to the polymer limit. This is relevant to charge transport and optical gap engineering in organic semiconductors and conjugated polymers, with implications for Organic Field-Effect Transistors (OFETs) and Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs).\n\nThe fundamental base is the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) and the Hückel approximation for conjugated systems: an orthonormal basis of localized $\\pi$ orbitals, constant on-site energy, and only nearest-neighbor coupling. The Hamiltonian under this approximation for a linear oligomer with $N$ sites is an $N \\times N$ real symmetric matrix with nearest-neighbor off-diagonal elements.\n\nDefine the following quantities:\n- $N$: the number of sites in the oligomer (use only even $N$ in this problem).\n- $\\alpha$: on-site energy in $\\mathrm{eV}$, constant for all sites.\n- $t$: mean nearest-neighbor coupling magnitude in $\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- $\\delta$: bond alternation (dimensionless), with $|\\delta|  1$, such that the two alternating nearest-neighbor couplings are $t_1 = t (1 + \\delta)$ and $t_2 = t (1 - \\delta)$.\n- $H$: the $N \\times N$ Hamiltonian with $H_{i,i} = \\alpha$ and $H_{i,i+1} = H_{i+1,i} = -t(1 + (-1)^i \\delta)$ for $i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,N-2\\}$ using zero-based indexing.\n- $E_1 \\le E_2 \\le \\dots \\le E_N$: the ordered eigenvalues of $H$ in $\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- $\\text{HOMO}(N) = E_{N/2}$ and $\\text{LUMO}(N) = E_{N/2 + 1}$ for even $N$, using $1$-based indexing.

            "solution": "The problem requires the formulation and implementation of a nearest-neighbor tight-binding calculation, also known as a Hückel model, for linear conjugated oligomers. The objective is to compute the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) - Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) energy gap as a function of chain length and extrapolate this gap to the infinite polymer limit ($N \\to \\infty$).\n\nThe problem is first validated and confirmed to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained. It represents a standard exercise in computational condensed matter physics.\n\nThe solution proceeds systematically as follows:\n\n1.  **Hamiltonian Construction**: The system is a linear chain of $N$ sites, described within the Hückel approximation. The basis set consists of one $p_z$ orbital per site, assumed to be orthonormal. The Hamiltonian matrix, $H$, is an $N \\times N$ real symmetric matrix. According to the problem statement, its elements are defined as:\n    -   On-site energy (diagonal elements): $H_{i,i} = \\alpha$ for all sites $i$.\n    -   Nearest-neighbor coupling (off-diagonal elements): For $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-2\\}$ using zero-based indexing, the coupling between site $i$ and site $i+1$ is $H_{i,i+1} = H_{i+1,i} = -t(1 + (-1)^i \\delta)$.\n\n    This structure describes a chain with alternating coupling strengths, a model for bond-length alternation. The two distinct coupling terms are $t_1 = t(1+\\delta)$ and $t_2 = t(1-\\delta)$. The Hamiltonian is a tridiagonal matrix of the form:\n    $$\n    H = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\alpha  -t_1  0  0  \\cdots \\\\\n    -t_1  \\alpha  -t_2  0  \\cdots \\\\\n    0  -t_2  \\alpha  -t_1  \\cdots \\\\\n    0  0  -t_1  \\alpha  \\cdots \\\\\n    \\vdots  \\vdots  \\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    For each given set of parameters ($\\alpha, t, \\delta$) and for each chain length $N$ in the specified list, this matrix is constructed numerically.\n\n2.  **Eigenvalue Calculation**: The energy levels of the molecular orbitals are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix $H$. Since $H$ is a real symmetric matrix, all its eigenvalues are real. We solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation in matrix form, $H\\psi = E\\psi$, which corresponds to finding the eigenvalues of $H$. This is a standard numerical procedure. We use a numerical linear algebra library, specifically a function optimized for finding eigenvalues of Hermitian (or real symmetric) matrices, which returns the eigenvalues $E_1, E_2, \\dots, E_N$ sorted in ascending order.\n\n3.  **HOMO-LUMO Gap Determination**: For a neutral conjugated system with $N$ sites, there are $N$ $\\pi$-electrons (one per site). According to the Pauli exclusion principle, each molecular orbital can hold two electrons of opposite spin. Therefore, the $N/2$ lowest energy orbitals are occupied. For an even number of sites $N$, the HOMO is the $(N/2)$-th orbital, and the LUMO is the $(N/2+1)$-th orbital. Using a zero-based index for the sorted array of eigenvalues `eigvals`, the HOMO energy is `eigvals[N/2 - 1]` and the LUMO energy is `eigvals[N/2]`. The energy gap is then calculated as:\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{gap}}(N) = \\text{LUMO}(N) - \\text{HOMO}(N) = E_{N/2} - E_{N/2-1}$$\n    This calculation is repeated for every value of $N$ in the test case.\n\n4.  **Extrapolation to the Polymer Limit**: To find the energy gap of the infinite polymer, $E_{\\infty}$, we perform a finite-size scaling analysis. The calculated gaps $E_{\\mathrm{gap}}(N)$ for the finite oligomers are fitted to the provided functional form:\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{gap}}(N) = E_{\\infty} + \\frac{c}{N} + \\frac{d}{N^2}$$\n    This is a linear least-squares problem. We seek the coefficients $\\beta = [E_{\\infty}, c, d]^T$ that minimize the sum of the squared residuals between the calculated gaps and the model. Let $y_i = E_{\\mathrm{gap}}(N_i)$ be the calculated gap for chain length $N_i$. We can set up a linear system $Y = A\\beta$, where:\n    $$\n    Y = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n    A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    1  1/N_1  1/N_1^2 \\\\\n    1  1/N_2  1/N_2^2 \\\\\n    \\vdots  \\vdots  \\vdots\n    \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n    \\beta = \\begin{pmatrix} E_{\\infty} \\\\ c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The solution is found using a standard linear least-squares solver. The first element of the resulting coefficient vector $\\beta$ is the desired extrapolated gap, $E_{\\infty}$.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each of the three test cases provided. The final result for $E_{\\infty}$ in each case is rounded to $6$ decimal places and presented in the required format. The analytical limit for this model is $E_{\\infty} = 4t|\\delta|$, which serves as a validation for the numerical extrapolation. For Case A ($t=2.5, \\delta=0.1$), $E_{\\infty} = 1.0$ eV. For Case B ($\\delta=0$), $E_{\\infty}=0.0$ eV. For Case C ($t=2.5, \\delta=0.3$), $E_{\\infty} = 3.0$ eV. The numerical fitting is expected to closely approximate these theoretical values.",

The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is determined to be **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Analytical Derivation\nThe derivation begins with the one-dimensional Poisson equation, which relates the spatial second derivative of the electric potential $\\phi(x)$ to the volume charge density $\\rho(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\phi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon} $$\nThe electric field $E(x)$ is defined as the negative gradient of the potential, $E(x) = -\\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx}$. Differentiating this expression with respect to $x$ yields $\\frac{dE(x)}{dx} = -\\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2}$. Substituting this into the Poisson equation gives its form in terms of the electric field, which is equivalent to Gauss's law in one dimension:\n$$ \\frac{dE(x)}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon} $$\nThe problem states that at the trap-filled limit, the space charge is dominated by the filled traps, resulting in a uniform charge density $\\rho(x) = e N_{t}$. Substituting this into the equation for the electric field gives:\n$$ \\frac{dE(x)}{dx} = \\frac{e N_{t}}{\\epsilon} $$\nTo find the electric field profile $E(x)$, we integrate the above equation with respect to position $x$. Let the hole-injecting anode be at $x=0$ and the cathode be at $x=L$.\n$$ E(x) = \\int \\frac{e N_{t}}{\\epsilon} \\, dx = \\frac{e N_{t}}{\\epsilon} x + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is the constant of integration. For ohmic injection in SCLC theory, the injecting contact is assumed to be an infinite reservoir of charge, which results in the electric field at that contact being zero. Therefore, the boundary condition is $E(0) = 0$. Applying this condition:\n$$ E(0) = \\frac{e N_{t}}{\\epsilon} (0) + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = 0 $$\nThe electric field distribution across the layer at the trap-filled limit is thus:\n$$ E(x) = \\frac{e N_{t}}{\\epsilon} x $$\nThe voltage across the device, $V$, is the integral of the electric field magnitude from the anode ($x=0$) to the cathode ($x=L$). The trap-filled limit voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$, is this voltage evaluated under the derived conditions:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} = \\int_0^L E(x) \\, dx = \\int_0^L \\frac{e N_{t}}{\\epsilon} x \\, dx $$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} = \\frac{e N_{t}}{\\epsilon} \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_0^L = \\frac{e N_{t}}{\\epsilon} \\left( \\frac{L^2}{2} - 0 \\right) $$\nThis yields the final analytical expression for the trap-filled limit voltage:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} = \\frac{e N_t L^2}{2 \\epsilon} $$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe are given the following parameters, ensuring they are in base SI units:\n- $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}~\\mathrm{C}$\n- $N_{t} = 2.5 \\times 10^{23}~\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $L = 120~\\mathrm{nm} = 120 \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{m} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\epsilon = 2.83 \\times 10^{-11}~\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} = \\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}~\\mathrm{C}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{23}~\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{m})^2}{2 \\times (2.83 \\times 10^{-11}~\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1})} $$\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} = \\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 2.5) \\times 1.44 \\times 10^{-19+23-14}}{2 \\times 2.83 \\times 10^{-11}}~\\mathrm{V} $$\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} = \\frac{4.005441585 \\times 1.44 \\times 10^{-10}}{5.66 \\times 10^{-11}}~\\mathrm{V} $$\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} = \\frac{5.7678358824 \\times 10^{-10}}{5.66 \\times 10^{-11}}~\\mathrm{V} \\approx 10.19052276~\\mathrm{V} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} \\approx 10.19~\\mathrm{V} $$\n\n### Qualitative J–V Transition\nThe transition at $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$ marks the crossover from a trap-limited conduction regime to a trap-free conduction regime.\n- For applied voltages $V  V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$, injected holes progressively fill the deep traps. Most of the injected charge becomes immobilized (trapped), and only a very small fraction of charge carriers is free to move and contribute to the current. The current is therefore strongly suppressed and is described by trap-limited SCLC theory.\n- As the voltage approaches $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$, the traps become completely filled. At the point $V = V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$, the total injected charge is equal to the total charge capacity of the traps, $Q_{\\mathrm{trapped}} = e N_t L A$, where $A$ is the device area.\n- For applied voltages $V  V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$, all traps are already filled and can no longer capture injected carriers. Any additional carriers injected into the layer remain free in the transport states. This causes a sudden and dramatic increase in the free carrier concentration.\nConsequently, the current density $J$ increases very steeply at $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$. On a log-log plot of $J$ versus $V$, this transition appears as a near-vertical rise in current. Beyond this sharp transition, for $V \\gg V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$, the current follows the trap-free Mott-Gurney law for SCLC, where $J \\propto V^2$, but with a much larger magnitude than in the trap-limited regime.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the effective areal gate capacitance, $C_{i}^{\\prime}$, of a multilayer gate dielectric stack in an Organic Field-Effect Transistor (OFET). The value is to be derived theoretically from the device structure and independently extracted from experimental small-signal measurements, with the final answer being a single value consistent with both approaches.\n\nThe analysis begins from first principles of electrostatics. The multilayer gate dielectric is composed of three distinct layers: poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), aluminum oxide (Al$_2$O$_3$), and a self-assembled monolayer (SAM). Under the assumption of quasi-static fields normal to the interfaces, this stack can be modeled as three parallel-plate capacitors connected in series.\n\nThe capacitance $C$ of a single parallel-plate capacitor is given by the formula:\n$$C = \\frac{\\varepsilon A}{t}$$\nwhere $A$ is the capacitor area, $t$ is the thickness of the dielectric layer, and $\\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of the dielectric material, defined as $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$. Here, $\\varepsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity of the material and $\\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of vacuum.\n\nThe areal capacitance, $C^{\\prime}$, is defined as the capacitance per unit area:\n$$C^{\\prime} = \\frac{C}{A} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{t} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0}{t}$$\n\nFor capacitors connected in series, the reciprocal of the total capacitance is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances. For the total gate insulator capacitance, $C_i$:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_i} = \\frac{1}{C_1} + \\frac{1}{C_2} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{int}}}$$\nwhere $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_{\\mathrm{int}}$ are the capacitances of the PMMA, Al$_2$O$_3$, and SAM layers, respectively.\n\nDividing by the area $A$ yields the relationship for the total or effective areal capacitance, $C_{i}^{\\prime}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_{i}^{\\prime}} = \\frac{A}{C_i} = A\\left(\\frac{1}{C_1} + \\frac{1}{C_2} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{int}}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{C_{1}^{\\prime}} + \\frac{1}{C_{2}^{\\prime}} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\prime}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for areal capacitance for each layer:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_{i}^{\\prime}} = \\frac{t_1}{\\varepsilon_{r,1} \\varepsilon_0} + \\frac{t_2}{\\varepsilon_{r,2} \\varepsilon_0} + \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{int}}}{\\varepsilon_{r,\\mathrm{int}} \\varepsilon_0}$$\nSolving for $C_{i}^{\\prime}$ gives the theoretical expression based on the device structure:\n$$C_{i}^{\\prime} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{t_1}{\\varepsilon_{r,1}} + \\frac{t_2}{\\varepsilon_{r,2}} + \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{int}}}{\\varepsilon_{r,\\mathrm{int}}} \\right] \\right)^{-1} = \\varepsilon_0 \\left( \\frac{t_1}{\\varepsilon_{r,1}} + \\frac{t_2}{\\varepsilon_{r,2}} + \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{int}}}{\\varepsilon_{r,\\mathrm{int}}} \\right)^{-1}$$\n\nWe now substitute the given parameters into this expression. All units must be converted to the SI system (meters, Farads, etc.).\nThe given parameters are:\n- $t_{1} = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 500 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\varepsilon_{r,1} = 3.6$\n- $t_{2} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\varepsilon_{r,2} = 9.0$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{int}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\varepsilon_{r,\\mathrm{int}} = 2.5$\n- $\\varepsilon_{0} = 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$\n\nLet us compute the sum of the effective thickness terms:\n$$\\frac{t_1}{\\varepsilon_{r,1}} = \\frac{500 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{3.6} \\approx 1.38889 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$\\frac{t_2}{\\varepsilon_{r,2}} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{9.0} \\approx 2.22222 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{int}}}{\\varepsilon_{r,\\mathrm{int}}} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{2.5} = 0.8 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe sum is:\n$$\\sum \\frac{t_k}{\\varepsilon_{r,k}} \\approx (138.889 + 2.222 + 0.8) \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 141.911 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nNow, we calculate $C_{i}^{\\prime}$:\n$$C_{i}^{\\prime} = \\frac{8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}}{1.41911 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 6.23924 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in units of $\\mathrm{nF\\,cm^{-2}}$. We use the conversion factors $1\\,\\mathrm{F} = 10^9\\,\\mathrm{nF}$ and $1\\,\\mathrm{m^2} = (100\\,\\mathrm{cm})^2 = 10^4\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2} = \\frac{10^9\\,\\mathrm{nF}}{10^4\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}} = 10^5\\,\\mathrm{nF\\,cm^{-2}}$$\nTherefore, the theoretical areal capacitance is:\n$$C_{i,\\mathrm{theory}}^{\\prime} = (6.23924 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{nF\\,cm^{-2}} = 6.23924\\,\\mathrm{nF\\,cm^{-2}}$$\n\nNext, we extract the areal capacitance from the experimental small-signal measurement. A sinusoidal voltage $V(t) = V_{\\mathrm{ac}} \\sin(\\omega t)$ is applied across the total gate capacitance $C_i$. The resulting displacement current $I(t)$ is given by:\n$$I(t) = C_i \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = C_i \\frac{d}{dt} [V_{\\mathrm{ac}} \\sin(\\omega t)] = C_i V_{\\mathrm{ac}} \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)$$\nThe amplitude of this current, $I_{\\mathrm{ac}}$, is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{ac}} = C_i V_{\\mathrm{ac}} \\omega = C_i V_{\\mathrm{ac}} (2 \\pi f)$$\nThe total capacitance $C_i$ can be expressed in terms of the areal capacitance $C_{i}^{\\prime}$ and gate area $A$ as $C_i = C_{i}^{\\prime} A$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{ac}} = C_{i}^{\\prime} A V_{\\mathrm{ac}} (2 \\pi f)$$\nSolving for the experimental areal capacitance, $C_{i,\\mathrm{exp}}^{\\prime}$:\n$$C_{i,\\mathrm{exp}}^{\\prime} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{ac}}}{A V_{\\mathrm{ac}} (2 \\pi f)}$$\nWe substitute the experimental values, again ensuring SI units are used:\n- $I_{\\mathrm{ac}} = 6.271 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- $A = 0.160\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2} = 0.160 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{ac}} = 50.0\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 50.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $f = 2.00 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n\n$$C_{i,\\mathrm{exp}}^{\\prime} = \\frac{6.271 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{(0.160 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m^2})(50.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V})(2 \\pi \\times 2.00 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}})}$$\n$$C_{i,\\mathrm{exp}}^{\\prime} = \\frac{6.271 \\times 10^{-7}}{(0.160 \\times 50.0 \\times 4000 \\pi) \\times 10^{-4} \\times 10^{-3}} \\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}$$\n$$C_{i,\\mathrm{exp}}^{\\prime} = \\frac{6.271 \\times 10^{-7}}{32000 \\pi \\times 10^{-7}} \\,\\mathrm{F/m^2} = \\frac{6.271}{3.2 \\pi \\times 10^{4}} \\,\\mathrm{F/m^2} \\approx 6.2382 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}$$\nConverting to $\\mathrm{nF\\,cm^{-2}}$:\n$$C_{i,\\mathrm{exp}}^{\\prime} = (6.2382 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{nF\\,cm^{-2}} = 6.2382\\,\\mathrm{nF\\,cm^{-2}}$$\n\nThe theoretically derived value ($6.23924\\,\\mathrm{nF\\,cm^{-2}}$) and the experimentally extracted value ($6.2382\\,\\mathrm{nF\\,cm^{-2}}$) are in excellent agreement. The difference is approximately $0.017\\%$, well within typical experimental uncertainty and precision limits of the given data. The problem asks for the single consistent value. The problem is constructed such that the experimental data verifies the theoretical model. The theoretical value is therefore the intended consistent value. Let's re-calculate the expected current from the theoretical capacitance to confirm:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{ac}} = C_{i,\\mathrm{theory}}^{\\prime} A V_{\\mathrm{ac}} (2 \\pi f)$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{ac}} = (6.23924 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}) (0.160 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}) (50.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) (2 \\pi \\times 2.00 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}})$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{ac}} \\approx 6.27165 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nWhen rounded to four significant figures, this value is $6.272 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{A}$, which is extremely close to the provided measurement of $6.271 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{A}$. The minor discrepancy arises from rounding conventions of the provided data. The theoretical value is therefore the intended consistent value.\n\nRounding the theoretical value of $C_{i}^{\\prime} = 6.23924\\,\\mathrm{nF\\,cm^{-2}}$ to four significant figures gives $6.239\\,\\mathrm{nF\\,cm^{-2}}$.",
