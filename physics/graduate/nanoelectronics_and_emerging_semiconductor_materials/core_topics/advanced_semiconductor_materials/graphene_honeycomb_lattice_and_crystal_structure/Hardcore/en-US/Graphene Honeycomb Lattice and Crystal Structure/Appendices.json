            "problem": "Graphene is a two-dimensional (2D) crystal whose honeycomb arrangement of carbon atoms can be represented as two interpenetrating triangular Bravais lattices, commonly labeled sublattices $A$ and $B$. The nearest-neighbor bonds from a site on sublattice $A$ to three sites on sublattice $B$ have a fixed carbon–carbon bond length $a_{\\mathrm{cc}}=0.142\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and are separated by $120^\\circ$ in the plane.

Round your numerical answer to four significant figures. Express your final answer in nanometers.",
            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, based on established principles of solid-state physics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem describes the honeycomb lattice of graphene, which is composed of two interpenetrating triangular Bravais sublattices, labeled $A$ and $B$. We are asked to determine the nearest-neighbor bond vectors, the primitive lattice vectors, and the lattice constant of one of these sublattices.\n\nLet us begin by establishing a Cartesian coordinate system. We place an atom from sublattice $A$ at the origin, so its position vector is $\\mathbf{R}_A = (0, 0)$. This atom has $3$ nearest neighbors, all belonging to sublattice $B$. The vectors pointing from the central $A$ atom to these $3$ $B$ atoms are the nearest-neighbor bond vectors, which we will denote as $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1$, $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_2$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_3$.\n\nThe problem states that the magnitude of each of these vectors is the carbon-carbon bond length, $|\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_i| = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} = 0.142\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$. The vectors are separated by angles of $120^{\\circ}$. We are instructed to align one bond with the positive $y$-axis. Let this be $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1$.\n\nThe vector $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1$ has magnitude $a_{\\mathrm{cc}}$ and points in the $(0, 1)$ direction. Therefore, its coordinates are:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} (0, 1) = (0, a_{\\mathrm{cc}}) $$\nThe angle of $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1$ with respect to the positive $x$-axis is $90^{\\circ}$. The other two vectors, $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_2$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_3$, are at angles of $90^{\\circ} + 120^{\\circ} = 210^{\\circ}$ and $90^{\\circ} - 120^{\\circ} = -30^{\\circ}$ (or $330^{\\circ}$), respectively. The problem statement also specifies that $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_2$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_3$ are symmetric about the $y$-axis, which we can verify.\n\nThe components of $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_2$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_3$ are found using trigonometry:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_2 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} (\\cos(210^{\\circ}), \\sin(210^{\\circ})) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_3 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} (\\cos(-30^{\\circ}), \\sin(-30^{\\circ})) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\nThe $x$-components are opposite while the $y$-components are identical, confirming the symmetry about the $y$-axis. This completes the identification of the three nearest-neighbor bond vectors.\n\nNext, we deduce the primitive vectors, $\\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2$, of the triangular Bravais lattice formed by the atoms of sublattice $A$. A primitive vector connects an atom in the lattice to one of its nearest equivalent atoms. In the graphene structure, an atom on sublattice $A$ is only bonded to atoms on sublattice $B$. To move from one $A$-site to a neighboring $A$-site, one must traverse a path of two bonds, for example, from an $A$-site to a $B$-site, and then from that $B$-site to another $A$-site.\n\nStarting from the $A$-site at the origin, we can reach a $B$-site at position $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_i$. From that $B$-site, the vectors to its three neighboring $A$-sites are $-\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1$, $-\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_2$, and $-\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_3$. Thus, the vectors connecting our original $A$-site to its nearest neighboring $A$-sites are of the form $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_i - \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j$ where $i \\neq j$. A valid set of primitive vectors can be chosen from these possibilities. Let us choose:\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_1 = \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1 - \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_2 $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_2 = \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_3 - \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_2 $$\nSubstituting the vector components:\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_1 = (0, a_{\\mathrm{cc}}) - a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(0 - (-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}), 1 - (-\\frac{1}{2})\\right) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_2 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - (-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}), -\\frac{1}{2} - (-\\frac{1}{2})\\right) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} (\\sqrt{3}, 0) $$\nThis choice is valid, but the problem's symmetry suggests choosing a pair of vectors with equal magnitude, which is more conventional. Let's use a different combination, for instance, $\\mathbf{a}_1 = \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_3 - \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_2 - \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1$.\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_1 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - (0, a_{\\mathrm{cc}}) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{3}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_2 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}}\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - (0, a_{\\mathrm{cc}}) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{3}{2}\\right) $$\nThese vectors also form a valid basis. The key property is that they are linear combinations of the $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_i$ vectors that connect sites of the same sublattice.\n\nThe lattice constant, $a$, is defined as the common magnitude of the primitive vectors, $a = |\\mathbf{a}_1| = |\\mathbf{a}_2|$. Let's calculate the magnitude for the second set of vectors we derived:\n$$ |\\mathbf{a}_1|^2 = \\left(a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{9}{4}\\right) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2 \\left(\\frac{12}{4}\\right) = 3 a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2 $$\n$$ |\\mathbf{a}_2|^2 = \\left(a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 + \\left(a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{9}{4}\\right) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2 \\left(\\frac{12}{4}\\right) = 3 a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2 $$\nBoth vectors have the same magnitude, as required for the primitive vectors of a triangular lattice. The lattice constant $a$ is:\n$$ a = \\sqrt{3 a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2} = \\sqrt{3} a_{\\mathrm{cc}} $$\n\nFinally, we evaluate the numerical value of the lattice constant $a$ using the given value for the carbon-carbon bond length, $a_{\\mathrm{cc}} = 0.142\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$ a = \\sqrt{3} \\times 0.142\\ \\mathrm{nm} $$\nUsing the value $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73205$:\n$$ a \\approx 1.73205 \\times 0.142\\ \\mathrm{nm} \\approx 0.2459511\\ \\mathrm{nm} $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, as requested, gives:\n$$ a \\approx 0.2460\\ \\mathrm{nm} $$\nThe trailing zero is significant.",

It is correctly described as a triangular Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis. Let us denote the two sublattices as $A$ and $B$. We can place an atom of sublattice $A$ at the origin $(0, 0)$ of a Cartesian coordinate system. Its three nearest neighbors, all belonging to sublattice $B$, are located at positions displaced by vectors $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_i$. Let the carbon-carbon bond length be $a_{\\mathrm{cc}}$.

The equations for the bisector lines are:\n1. $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{G}_A = \\frac{1}{2} |\\mathbf{G}_A|^2$\n2. $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{G}_B = \\frac{1}{2} |\\mathbf{G}_B|^2$\n\nSince $|\\mathbf{G}_A|^2 = |\\mathbf{G}_B|^2 = |\\mathbf{b}_1|^2 = |\\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2|^2 = b^2$, we have:\n1. $\\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot (\\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2) = \\frac{1}{2} b^2$\n2. $\\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1 = \\frac{1}{2} b^2$\n\nSubstituting (2) into (1):\n$$\n(\\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1) + (\\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2) = \\frac{1}{2} b^2 \\implies \\frac{1}{2} b^2 + (\\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2) = \\frac{1}{2} b^2 \\implies \\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2 = 0\n$$\nThis means that the vector $\\mathbf{k}_K$ is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\left(0, \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$. Since $\\mathbf{b}_2$ is purely along the $k_y$ direction, $\\mathbf{k}_K$ must be purely along the $k_x$ direction. Let $\\mathbf{k}_K = (k_x, 0)$.\n\nNow we use equation (2) to find $k_x$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1 = (k_x, 0) \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\left(1, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = k_x \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\n$$\nAnd the right-hand side is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} |\\mathbf{b}_1|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^2} = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^2}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions:\n$$\nk_x \\frac{2\\pi}{a} = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^2} \\implies k_x = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^2} \\cdot \\frac{a}{2\\pi} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a}\n$$\nThe vector to this $K$ point is $\\mathbf{k}_K = \\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3a}, 0\\right)$. The distance $|\\Gamma K|$ is its magnitude:\n$$\n|\\Gamma K| = |\\mathbf{k}_K| = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a}\n$$\n\nAs a verification, we can use the geometry of the regular hexagon. The triangle formed by $\\Gamma$, $M$, and $K$ is a $30^{\\circ}-60^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}$ right triangle, with the right angle at $M$. The distance to the corner, $|\\Gamma K|$, is related to the distance to the edge midpoint, $|\\Gamma M|$, by:\n$$\n|\\Gamma K| = \\frac{|\\Gamma M|}{\\cos(30^{\\circ})} = \\frac{|\\Gamma M|}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} |\\Gamma M|\n$$\nSubstituting our result for $|\\Gamma M|$:\n$$\n|\\Gamma K| = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a}\n$$\nThis confirms the result obtained from solving the intersection equations. The expressions for the required distances are therefore $|\\Gamma K| = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a}$ and $|\\Gamma M| = \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}$.",
