Round your numerical answer to four significant figures. Express your final answer in nanometers.",
            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, based on established principles of solid-state physics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem describes the honeycomb lattice of graphene, which is composed of two interpenetrating triangular Bravais sublattices, labeled $A$ and $B$. We are asked to determine the nearest-neighbor bond vectors, the primitive lattice vectors, and the lattice constant of one of these sublattices.\n\nLet us begin by establishing a Cartesian coordinate system. We place an atom from sublattice $A$ at the origin, so its position vector is $\\mathbf{R}_A = (0, 0)$. This atom has $3$ nearest neighbors, all belonging to sublattice $B$. The vectors pointing from the central $A$ atom to these $3$ $B$ atoms are the nearest-neighbor bond vectors, which we will denote as $\\mathbf{\\delta}_1$, $\\mathbf{\\delta}_2$, and $\\mathbf{\\delta}_3$.\n\nThe problem states that the magnitude of each of these vectors is the carbon-carbon bond length, $|\\mathbf{\\delta}_i| = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} = 0.142\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$. The vectors are separated by angles of $120^{\\circ}$. We are instructed to align one bond with the positive $y$-axis. Let this be $\\mathbf{\\delta}_1$.\n\nThe vector $\\mathbf{\\delta}_1$ has magnitude $a_{\\mathrm{cc}}$ and points in the $(0, 1)$ direction. Therefore, its coordinates are:\n$$ \\mathbf{\\delta}_1 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} (0, 1) = (0, a_{\\mathrm{cc}}) $$\nThe angle of $\\mathbf{\\delta}_1$ with respect to the positive $x$-axis is $90^{\\circ}$. The other two vectors, $\\mathbf{\\delta}_2$ and $\\mathbf{\\delta}_3$, are at angles of $90^{\\circ} + 120^{\\circ} = 210^{\\circ}$ and $90^{\\circ} - 120^{\\circ} = -30^{\\circ}$ (or $330^{\\circ}$), respectively. The problem statement also specifies that $\\mathbf{\\delta}_2$ and $\\mathbf{\\delta}_3$ are symmetric about the $y$-axis, which we can verify.\n\nThe components of $\\mathbf{\\delta}_2$ and $\\mathbf{\\delta}_3$ are found using trigonometry:\n$$ \\mathbf{\\delta}_2 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} (\\cos(210^{\\circ}), \\sin(210^{\\circ})) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{\\delta}_3 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} (\\cos(-30^{\\circ}), \\sin(-30^{\\circ})) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\nThe $x$-components are opposite while the $y$-components are identical, confirming the symmetry about the $y$-axis. This completes the identification of the three nearest-neighbor bond vectors.\n\nNext, we deduce the primitive vectors, $\\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2$, of the triangular Bravais lattice formed by the atoms of sublattice $A$. A primitive vector connects an atom in the lattice to one of its nearest equivalent atoms. In the graphene structure, an atom on sublattice $A$ is only bonded to atoms on sublattice $B$. To move from one $A$-site to a neighboring $A$-site, one must traverse a path of two bonds, for example, from an $A$-site to a $B$-site, and then from that $B$-site to another $A$-site.\n\nStarting from the $A$-site at the origin, we can reach a $B$-site at position $\\mathbf{\\delta}_i$. From that $B$-site, the vectors to its three neighboring $A$-sites are $-\\mathbf{\\delta}_1$, $-\\mathbf{\\delta}_2$, and $-\\mathbf{\\delta}_3$. Thus, the vectors connecting our original $A$-site to its nearest neighboring $A$-sites are of the form $\\mathbf{\\delta}_i - \\mathbf{\\delta}_j$ where $i \\neq j$. A valid set of primitive vectors can be chosen from these possibilities. Let us choose:\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_1 = \\mathbf{\\delta}_1 - \\mathbf{\\delta}_2 $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_2 = \\mathbf{\\delta}_3 - \\mathbf{\\delta}_2 $$\nSubstituting the vector components:\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_1 = (0, a_{\\mathrm{cc}}) - a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(0 - (-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}), 1 - (-\\frac{1}{2})\\right) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_2 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - (-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}), -\\frac{1}{2} - (-\\frac{1}{2})\\right) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} (\\sqrt{3}, 0) $$\nThis choice is valid, but the problem's symmetry suggests choosing a pair of vectors with equal magnitude, which is more conventional. Let's use a different combination, for instance, $\\mathbf{a}_1 = \\mathbf{\\delta_3} - \\mathbf{\\delta_1}$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\mathbf{\\delta_2} - \\mathbf{\\delta_1}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_1 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - (0, a_{\\mathrm{cc}}) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{3}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_2 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}}\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - (0, a_{\\mathrm{cc}}) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{3}{2}\\right) $$\nThese vectors also form a valid basis. The key property is that they are linear combinations of the $\\mathbf{\\delta}_i$ vectors that connect sites of the same sublattice.\n\nThe lattice constant, $a$, is defined as the common magnitude of the primitive vectors, $a = |\\mathbf{a}_1| = |\\mathbf{a}_2|$. Let's calculate the magnitude for the second set of vectors we derived:\n$$ |\\mathbf{a}_1|^2 = \\left(a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{9}{4}\\right) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2 \\left(\\frac{12}{4}\\right) = 3 a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2 $$\n$$ |\\mathbf{a}_2|^2 = \\left(a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 + \\left(a_{\\mathrm{cc}} \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 = a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{9}{4}\\right) = a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2 \\left(\\frac{12}{4}\\right) = 3 a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2 $$\nBoth vectors have the same magnitude, as required for the primitive vectors of a triangular lattice. The lattice constant $a$ is:\n$$ a = \\sqrt{3 a_{\\mathrm{cc}}^2} = \\sqrt{3} a_{\\mathrm{cc}} $$\n\nFinally, we evaluate the numerical value of the lattice constant $a$ using the given value for the carbon-carbon bond length, $a_{\\mathrm{cc}} = 0.142\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$ a = \\sqrt{3} \\times 0.142\\ \\mathrm{nm} $$\nUsing the value $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73205$:\n$$ a \\approx 1.73205 \\times 0.142\\ \\mathrm{nm} \\approx 0.2459511\\ \\mathrm{nm} $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, as requested, gives:\n$$ a \\approx 0.2460\\ \\mathrm{nm} $$\nThe trailing zero is significant.",

We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the magnitudes of the $k$-space vectors from the Brillouin zone center ($\\Gamma$) to the high-symmetry points $K$ (a corner) and $M$ (an edge midpoint). The derivation must be based on the fundamental construction of the reciprocal lattice and its Wigner-Seitz cell (the first Brillouin zone).\n\nFirst, we define a set of real-space primitive lattice vectors $\\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2$ for the triangular Bravais lattice, consistent with the problem statement. The vectors must have magnitude $a$ and a relative angle of $60^{\\circ}$.

Its boundaries are the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors connecting $\\Gamma$ to its nearest-neighbor reciprocal lattice points. We must therefore identify the set of reciprocal lattice vectors $\\mathbf{G} = n_1\\mathbf{b}_1 + n_2\\mathbf{b}_2$ (with $n_1, n_2$ integers) having the smallest non-zero magnitude.\n\nLet's calculate the squared magnitudes of $\\mathbf{b}_1$, $\\mathbf{b}_2$, and simple combinations.\n$$\n|\\mathbf{b}_1|^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 \\left(1^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n|\\mathbf{b}_2|^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 \\left(0^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe magnitude of these primitive vectors is $|\\mathbf{b}_1|=|\\mathbf{b}_2|=\\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}$.

The magnitude of each of these vectors is $b = \\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nThe high-symmetry point $M$ is the midpoint of an edge of the Brillouin zone. By construction, each edge lies on the perpendicular bisector of a nearest-neighbor reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G}$. The point $M$ on this bisector closest to the origin $\\Gamma$ is precisely at the midpoint of the vector $\\mathbf{G}$.\nLet's choose the vector $\\mathbf{G} = \\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\left(0, \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$.

A corner is formed by the intersection of two adjacent perpendicular bisector lines. Let's find the intersection point $\\mathbf{k}_K$ of the bisectors for the vectors $\\mathbf{G}_A = \\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2$ and $\\mathbf{G}_B = \\mathbf{b}_1$. The equations for the bisector lines are:\n1. $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{G}_A = \\frac{1}{2} |\\mathbf{G}_A|^2$\n2. $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{G}_B = \\frac{1}{2} |\\mathbf{G}_B|^2$\n\nSince $|\\mathbf{G}_A|^2 = |\\mathbf{G}_B|^2 = |\\mathbf{b}_1|^2 = |\\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2|^2 = b^2$, we have:\n1. $\\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot (\\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2) = \\frac{1}{2} b^2$\n2. $\\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1 = \\frac{1}{2} b^2$\n\nSubstituting (2) into (1):\n$$\n(\\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1) + (\\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2) = \\frac{1}{2} b^2 \\implies \\frac{1}{2} b^2 + (\\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2) = \\frac{1}{2} b^2 \\implies \\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2 = 0\n$$\nThis means that the vector $\\mathbf{k}_K$ is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\left(0, \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$. Since $\\mathbf{b}_2$ is purely along the $k_y$ direction, $\\mathbf{k}_K$ must be purely along the $k_x$ direction. Let $\\mathbf{k}_K = (k_x, 0)$.\n\nNow we use equation (2) to find $k_x$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{k}_K \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1 = (k_x, 0) \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\left(1, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = k_x \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\n$$\nAnd the right-hand side is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} |\\mathbf{b}_1|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^2} = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^2}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions:\n$$\nk_x \\frac{2\\pi}{a} = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^2} \\implies k_x = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^2} \\cdot \\frac{a}{2\\pi} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a}\n$$\nThe vector to this $K$ point is $\\mathbf{k}_K = \\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3a}, 0\\right)$. The distance $|\\Gamma K|$ is its magnitude:\n$$\n|\\Gamma K| = |\\mathbf{k}_K| = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a}\n$$\n\nAs a verification, we can use the geometry of the regular hexagon. The triangle formed by $\\Gamma$, $M$, and $K$ is a $30^{\\circ}-60^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}$ right triangle, with the right angle at $M$. The distance to the corner, $|\\Gamma K|$, is related to the distance to the edge midpoint, $|\\Gamma M|$, by:\n$$\n|\\Gamma K| = \\frac{|\\Gamma M|}{\\cos(30^{\\circ})} = \\frac{|\\Gamma M|}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} |\\Gamma M|\n$$\nSubstituting our result for $|\\Gamma M|$:\n$$\n|\\Gamma K| = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a}\n$$\nThis confirms the result obtained from solving the intersection equations.

A systematic way is to construct the matrix of real-space vectors $A = [\\mathbf{a}_1 | \\mathbf{a}_2]$ and find the matrix of reciprocal vectors $B = [\\mathbf{b}_1 | \\mathbf{b}_2]$ using $B = 2\\pi (A^T)^{-1}$.\n$$\nA = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ \\sqrt{3} & \\sqrt{3} \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\implies \\quad A^T = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\sqrt{3} \\\\ -1 & \\sqrt{3} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $\\det(A^T) = (\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}}{2})^2 (\\sqrt{3} - (-\\sqrt{3})) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} a_{\\mathrm{lat}}^2}{2}$. The inverse is:\n$$\n(A^T)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A^T)} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}}{2}\\sqrt{3} & -\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}}{2}\\sqrt{3} \\\\ \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}}{2} & \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}}{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} a_{\\mathrm{lat}}} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{3} & -\\sqrt{3} \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe reciprocal vectors are the columns of $B = 2\\pi (A^T)^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}} \\left(1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right), \\quad \\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}} \\left(-1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\n$$\n\n**2. Dirac Wavevector $\\mathbf{K}$**\nUsing the expression $\\mathbf{K} = \\frac{1}{3} (\\mathbf{b}_{1} + 2\\mathbf{b}_{2})$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left[ \\frac{2\\pi}{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}} \\left(1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) + 2 \\frac{2\\pi}{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}} \\left(-1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{2\\pi}{3a_{\\mathrm{lat}}} \\left(1-2, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3a_{\\mathrm{lat}}} \\left(-1, \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3 a_{\\mathrm{lat}}} \\left(-1, \\sqrt{3}\\right)\n$$\n\n**3. Phase Factors**\nNow we compute the dot products $\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{1} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3 a_{\\mathrm{lat}}} \\left(-1, \\sqrt{3}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}}{\\sqrt{3}} (0, 1) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}} (0 + \\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3 a_{\\mathrm{lat}}} \\left(-1, \\sqrt{3}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3 a_{\\mathrm{lat}}} \\left(-1, \\sqrt{3}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{lat}}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}} \\left( -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}} (-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\n$$\nThe three phases are $2\\pi/3$, $0$, and $-2\\pi/3$.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nFinally, we substitute these phases into the definition of $S(\\mathbf{K})$:\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{K}) = e^{i(2\\pi/3)} + e^{i(0)} + e^{i(-2\\pi/3)}\n$$\nUsing Euler's formula $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$:\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{K}) = \\left(\\cos\\frac{2\\pi}{3} + i\\sin\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) + 1 + \\left(\\cos\\frac{-2\\pi}{3} + i\\sin\\frac{-2\\pi}{3}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\cos(-x)=\\cos(x)$ and $\\sin(-x)=-\\sin(x)$, the imaginary parts cancel.\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{K}) = 1 + 2\\cos\\frac{2\\pi}{3} = 1 + 2\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 - 1 = 0\n$$\nThe structure factor is exactly zero, confirming that the given wavevector $\\mathbf{K}$ is a Dirac point.",
