The transport is therefore dominated by a single addition energy $E$ associated with the $N=0 \\to N=1$ transition. This corresponds to a point on the charge-degeneracy line of the stability diagram (Coulomb diamond edge), where a single resonant level governs sequential tunneling. The device is coupled to a source lead ($S$) and a drain lead ($D$) with energy-independent tunneling rates $\\Gamma_S$ and $\\Gamma_D$ in the weak-coupling limit, and the leads are in thermal equilibrium at a common temperature with chemical potentials $\\mu_S$ and $\\mu_D$ set by the applied bias.

The dot is capacitively coupled to source, drain, and gate electrodes with total capacitance $\\,C_{\\Sigma}=C_{\\mathrm{S}}+C_{\\mathrm{D}}+C_{\\mathrm{G}}\\,$, and the usual orthodox Coulomb blockade model applies.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the magnitude of the vertical shift in the Coulomb diamond edges when the metallic leads of a single-electron transistor are replaced with superconducting leads. We begin by applying the principles of energy conservation and the orthodox model of Coulomb blockade, first for the normal-metal case as a reference, and then for the superconducting case, incorporating the constraints imposed by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) density of states.\n\nLet $\\mu_{\\text{dot}}(N)$ be the electrochemical potential of the quantum dot for the transition involving the $N$-th electron. This potential is a function of the gate voltage $V_{\\mathrm{G}}$. The source and drain electrodes are held at potentials $V_{\\mathrm{S}} = +V_{\\mathrm{SD}}/2$ and $V_{\\mathrm{D}} = -V_{\\mathrm{SD}}/2$, respectively.
