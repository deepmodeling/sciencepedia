The transport is therefore dominated by a single addition energy $E$ associated with the $N=0 \\to N=1$ transition. This corresponds to a point on the charge-degeneracy line of the stability diagram (Coulomb diamond edge), where a single resonant level governs sequential tunneling. The device is coupled to a source lead ($S$) and a drain lead ($D$) with energy-independent tunneling rates $\\Gamma_S$ and $\\Gamma_D$ in the weak-coupling limit, and the leads are in thermal equilibrium at a common temperature with chemical potentials $\\mu_S$ and $\\mu_D$ set by the applied bias.

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard, solvable problem in the field of nanoelectronics concerning quantum transport in a single-electron transistor. The assumptions are physically reasonable and common in the literature. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem describes a two-state system, with the single-electron transistor (SET) being either empty (occupation number $N=0$) or occupied by a single electron ($N=1$). The probabilities of these states are denoted by $P_0(t)$ and $P_1(t)$, respectively.\n\nFirst, we write the master equation for the time evolution of the occupation probabilities. The total rate of transition from state $N=0$ to state $N=1$, which we denote as $R_{0 \\to 1}$, is the sum of rates of an electron tunneling into the SET from the source ($S$) and the drain ($D$). Using the provided rate expressions:\n$$\nR_{0 \\to 1} = \\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E)\n$$\nThe total rate of transition from state $N=1$ to state $N=0$, denoted as $R_{1 \\to 0}$, is the sum of rates of the electron tunneling out of the SET to the source and the drain:\n$$\nR_{1 \\to 0} = \\Gamma_S \\left[1 - f_S(E)\\right] + \\Gamma_D \\left[1 - f_D(E)\\right]\n$$\nThe master equation for the probability $P_1(t)$ is given by the rate of increase due to transitions into state $N=1$ minus the rate of decrease due to transitions out of state $N=1$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_1(t)}{dt} = R_{0 \\to 1} P_0(t) - R_{1 \\to 0} P_1(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the rate expressions:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_1(t)}{dt} = \\left[ \\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E) \\right] P_0(t) - \\left[ \\Gamma_S (1 - f_S(E)) + \\Gamma_D (1 - f_D(E)) \\right] P_1(t)\n$$\nThe total probability must be conserved. The system must be in one of the two states, so we enforce the normalization condition:\n$$\nP_0(t) + P_1(t) = 1\n$$\nThis implies that $\\frac{dP_0(t)}{dt} + \\frac{dP_1(t)}{dt} = 0$, so $\\frac{dP_0(t)}{dt} = - \\frac{dP_1(t)}{dt}$. The master equation for $P_0(t)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_0(t)}{dt} = \\left[ \\Gamma_S (1 - f_S(E)) + \\Gamma_D (1 - f_D(E)) \\right] P_1(t) - \\left[ \\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E) \\right] P_0(t)\n$$\nThis completes the first task.\n\nNext, we solve for the stationary probabilities, denoted $P_0$ and $P_1$. In the steady state, the probabilities are constant, so their time derivatives are zero. Setting $\\frac{dP_1(t)}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\n\\left[ \\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E) \\right] P_0 = \\left[ \\Gamma_S (1 - f_S(E)) + \\Gamma_D (1 - f_D(E)) \\right] P_1\n$$\nWe have a system of two linear equations for $P_0$ and $P_1$:\n1.  $\\left[ \\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E) \\right] P_0 - \\left[ \\Gamma_S (1 - f_S(E)) + \\Gamma_D (1 - f_D(E)) \\right] P_1 = 0$\n2.  $P_0 + P_1 = 1$\n\nFrom equation (2), we substitute $P_0 = 1 - P_1$ into equation (1):\n$$\n\\left[ \\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E) \\right] (1 - P_1) = \\left[ \\Gamma_S (1 - f_S(E)) + \\Gamma_D (1 - f_D(E)) \\right] P_1\n$$\nLet's expand and solve for $P_1$:\n$$\n\\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E) - \\left[ \\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E) \\right] P_1 = \\left[ \\Gamma_S - \\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D - \\Gamma_D f_D(E) \\right] P_1\n$$\nMove all terms with $P_1$ to the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E) = \\left[ \\Gamma_S - \\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D - \\Gamma_D f_D(E) + \\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E) \\right] P_1\n$$\nSimplifying the expression in the brackets gives:\n$$\n\\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E) = (\\Gamma_S + \\Gamma_D) P_1\n$$\nThus, the stationary probability of the occupied state is:\n$$\nP_1 = \\frac{\\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E)}{\\Gamma_S + \\Gamma_D}\n$$\nThe stationary probability of the empty state $P_0$ is found using $P_0 = 1 - P_1$:\n$$\nP_0 = 1 - \\frac{\\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E)}{\\Gamma_S + \\Gamma_D} = \\frac{(\\Gamma_S + \\Gamma_D) - (\\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E))}{\\Gamma_S + \\Gamma_D}\n$$\n$$\nP_0 = \\frac{\\Gamma_S (1 - f_S(E)) + \\Gamma_D (1 - f_D(E))}{\\Gamma_S + \\Gamma_D}\n$$\nThis completes the second task.\n\nFinally, we derive the steady-state electrical current $I$. The problem defines the current from the source lead into the device as $I_S$. In steady state, this current is constant and is equal to the current through the device, $I = I_S$. The given expression is:\n$$\nI = e \\left[ \\Gamma_S f_S(E) P_0 - \\Gamma_S (1 - f_S(E)) P_1 \\right]\n$$\nNow, substitute the stationary probabilities $P_0$ and $P_1$ into this expression:\n$$\nI = e \\Gamma_S \\left[ f_S(E) \\left( \\frac{\\Gamma_S (1 - f_S(E)) + \\Gamma_D (1 - f_D(E))}{\\Gamma_S + \\Gamma_D} \\right) - (1 - f_S(E)) \\left( \\frac{\\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E)}{\\Gamma_S + \\Gamma_D} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nFactor out the common denominator $\\Gamma_S + \\Gamma_D$:\n$$\nI = \\frac{e \\Gamma_S}{\\Gamma_S + \\Gamma_D} \\left[ f_S(E) \\left( \\Gamma_S (1 - f_S(E)) + \\Gamma_D (1 - f_D(E)) \\right) - (1 - f_S(E)) \\left( \\Gamma_S f_S(E) + \\Gamma_D f_D(E) \\right) \\right]\n$$\nExpand the terms inside the brackets. Let $f_S = f_S(E)$ and $f_D = f_D(E)$ for brevity in the expansion:\n$$\n\\text{Term 1: } f_S (\\Gamma_S - \\Gamma_S f_S + \\Gamma_D - \\Gamma_D f_D) = \\Gamma_S f_S - \\Gamma_S f_S^2 + \\Gamma_D f_S - \\Gamma_D f_S f_D\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Term 2: } (1 - f_S) (\\Gamma_S f_S + \\Gamma_D f_D) = \\Gamma_S f_S + \\Gamma_D f_D - \\Gamma_S f_S^2 - \\Gamma_D f_S f_D\n$$\nSubtracting the second expanded term from the first:\n$$\n(\\Gamma_S f_S - \\Gamma_S f_S^2 + \\Gamma_D f_S - \\Gamma_D f_S f_D) - (\\Gamma_S f_S + \\Gamma_D f_D - \\Gamma_S f_S^2 - \\Gamma_D f_S f_D)\n$$\n$$\n= \\Gamma_S f_S - \\Gamma_S f_S^2 + \\Gamma_D f_S - \\Gamma_D f_S f_D - \\Gamma_S f_S - \\Gamma_D f_D + \\Gamma_S f_S^2 + \\Gamma_D f_S f_D\n$$\nThe following terms cancel out: $\\Gamma_S f_S$ with $-\\Gamma_S f_S$; $-\\Gamma_S f_S^2$ with $+\\Gamma_S f_S^2$; and $-\\Gamma_D f_S f_D$ with $+\\Gamma_D f_S f_D$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the magnitude of the vertical shift in the Coulomb diamond edges when the metallic leads of a single-electron transistor are replaced with superconducting leads. We begin by applying the principles of energy conservation and the orthodox model of Coulomb blockade, first for the normal-metal case as a reference, and then for the superconducting case, incorporating the constraints imposed by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) density of states.\n\nLet $\\mu_{\\text{dot}}(N)$ be the electrochemical potential of the quantum dot for the transition involving the $N$-th electron. This potential is a function of the gate voltage $V_{\\mathrm{G}}$. The source and drain electrodes are held at potentials $V_{\\mathrm{S}} = +V_{\\mathrm{SD}}/2$ and $V_{\\mathrm{D}} = -V_{\\mathrm{SD}}/2$, respectively. The corresponding chemical potentials in the leads, relative to the equilibrium Fermi level (set to $0$), are $\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}} = e V_{\\mathrm{S}} = +e V_{\\mathrm{SD}}/2$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}} = e V_{\\mathrm{D}} = -e V_{\\mathrm{SD}}/2$. The elementary charge is denoted by $e  0$.\n\nFirst, we establish the condition for current flow in the normal-metal case ($N$-leads). Sequential electron tunneling is possible when the dot's electrochemical potential lies within the energy window defined by the lead chemical potentials:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}} \\le \\mu_{\\text{dot}}(N) \\le \\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}}$, we get:\n$$\n-\\frac{eV_{\\text{SD}}}{2} \\le \\mu_{\\text{dot}}(N) \\le +\\frac{eV_{\\text{SD}}}{2}\n$$\nThe Coulomb diamond is the region in the $(V_{\\mathrm{G}}, V_{\\text{SD}})$ plane where current is blockaded. The edges of this diamond are defined by the onset of current, which occurs when one of the inequalities above becomes an equality. For a positive source-drain voltage $V_{\\text{SD}}  0$, the boundaries of the stability diagram are given by:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{dot}}(N) = +\\frac{eV_{\\text{SD,N}}}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\mu_{\\text{dot}}(N) = -\\frac{eV_{\\text{SD,N}}}{2}\n$$\nwhere $V_{\\text{SD,N}}$ is the source-drain voltage in the normal case.

This means the entire V-shape of the diamond boundary for $V_{\\text{SD}}0$ is shifted upwards by this amount. This upward shift creates a transport gap at the diamond tip, where current is blockaded until $V_{\\text{SD}}$ reaches $2\\Delta/e$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this result numerically for $\\Delta = 210\\,\\mu\\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe magnitude of the voltage shift is:\n$$\n\\delta V_{\\text{SD}} = \\frac{2\\Delta}{e} = \\frac{2 \\times (210\\,\\mu\\mathrm{eV})}{e}\n$$\nSince $1\\,\\mathrm{V} = 1\\,\\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{C}$ and $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = e \\times (1\\,\\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{C})$, the quantity $\\Delta/e$ has units of voltage.
