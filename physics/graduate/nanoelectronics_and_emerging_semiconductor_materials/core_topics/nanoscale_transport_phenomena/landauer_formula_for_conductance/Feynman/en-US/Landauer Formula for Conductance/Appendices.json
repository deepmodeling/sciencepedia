It is a valid, well-defined problem in physics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as requested: first, a dimensional analysis of the terms in the Landauer formula, and second, a numerical calculation of the conductance prefactor.\n\n**Part 1: Dimensional Analysis**\n\nThe total conductance is given by the expression $G = \\frac{2 e^{2}}{h} \\sum_{n} T_{n}$. For this equation to be dimensionally consistent, the right-hand side must have the units of conductance. We will analyze the dimensions of the summation term and the prefactor separately.\n\nFirst, consider the term $\\sum_{n} T_{n}$. The quantity $T_n$ is defined as the transmission probability for the $n$-th mode. A probability is a ratio of like quantities (e.g., transmitted flux over incident flux) and is therefore a pure, dimensionless number. A summation of dimensionless numbers, $\\sum_{n} T_{n}$, results in a dimensionless quantity. Therefore, the term $\\sum_{n} T_{n}$ is dimensionless.\n\nNext, we analyze the dimensions of the prefactor, $\\frac{2 e^{2}}{h}$. The factor of $2$ arises from spin degeneracy and is a dimensionless pure number. We denote the dimensions of a physical quantity $X$ by $[X]$. The elementary charge $e$ has the dimension of charge, $[e] = Q$, which is the Coulomb ($C$) in SI units. Planck's constant $h$ has dimensions of energy multiplied by time, $[h] = E \\cdot T$. In SI units, this is Joule-second ($J \\cdot s$). The dimensions of the prefactor are therefore:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{e^2}{h}\\right] = \\frac{[e]^2}{[h]} = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T}\n$$\nIn SI units, this is $\\frac{C^2}{J \\cdot s}$.\n\nNow, we must verify that these are the dimensions of conductance. Conductance $G$ is defined as the ratio of current $I$ to voltage $V$: $G = I/V$. The dimension of current, which is the rate of flow of charge, is $[I] = Q/T$. In SI units, this is Ampere ($A$), where $1\\,A = 1\\,C/s$. The dimension of voltage (electric potential difference), which is energy per unit charge, is $[V] = E/Q$. In SI units, this is Volt ($V$), where $1\\,V = 1\\,J/C$.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of conductance are:\n$$\n[G] = \\frac{[I]}{[V]} = \\frac{Q/T}{E/Q} = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T}\n$$\nIn SI units, this corresponds to $\\frac{C/s}{J/C} = \\frac{C^2}{J \\cdot s}$. This unit is defined as the Siemens ($S$).\n\nComparing the dimensions of the prefactor $\\frac{e^2}{h}$ with the dimensions of conductance $G$, we find they are identical.\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{e^2}{h}\\right] = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad [G] = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T}\n$$\nThis confirms that the prefactor $\\frac{2e^2}{h}$ has units of conductance. Since the summation term is dimensionless, the entire expression for $G$ correctly has the units of conductance, validating the dimensional consistency of the Landauer formula.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the numerical value of the prefactor, which is known as the quantum of conductance, $G_0 = \\frac{2 e^2}{h}$.\nThe given values for the constants are:\n- Elementary charge, $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,C$.\n- Planck's constant, $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,J \\cdot s$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the expression for $G_0$:\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{2 e^2}{h} = \\frac{2 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,C)^2}{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,J \\cdot s}\n$$\nLet's calculate the numerical value:\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{2 \\times (1.602176634)^2 \\times 10^{-38}}{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}} \\frac{C^2}{J \\cdot s}\n$$\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{2 \\times 2.566970054...}{6.62607015} \\times 10^{-4} \\, S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{5.133940108...}{6.62607015} \\times 10^{-4} \\, S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 \\approx 0.7748091729... \\times 10^{-4} \\, S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 \\approx 7.748091729... \\times 10^{-5} \\, S\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in microsiemens ($\\mu S$). The conversion is $1\\,S = 10^6\\,\\mu S$.\n$$\nG_0 \\approx (7.748091729... \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 10^6 \\, \\mu S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 \\approx 77.48091729... \\, \\mu S\n$$\nFinally, we must round the result to five significant figures. The first five significant figures are $7, 7, 4, 8, 0$. The sixth digit is $9$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fifth digit.\n$$\nG_0 \\approx 77.481 \\, \\mu S\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. It is a standard problem in mesoscopic physics concerning the resonant level model.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the energy-dependent transmission probability $T(E)$ using the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. The remaining quantities are then derived from this central result.\n\n(i) Derivation of the transmission probability $T(E)$:\n\nThe transmission probability through the single-level quantum dot is given by the Fisher-Lee relation, expressed in terms of the dot's retarded Green's function $G_{dd}^R(E)$ and the lead coupling (hybridization) functions $\\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E)$:\n$$\nT(E) = \\Gamma_L(E) \\Gamma_R(E) |G_{dd}^R(E)|^2\n$$\nThe problem specifies the wide-band limit, where the hybridization functions are independent of energy: $\\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E) = \\Gamma_{\\alpha}$. Thus, the formula becomes:\n$$\nT(E) = \\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R |G_{dd}^R(E)|^2\n$$\nTo find $G_{dd}^R(E)$, we use the Dyson equation for the dot's Green's function:\n$$\nG_{dd}^R(E) = \\left[ (G_{0,dd}^R(E))^{-1} - \\Sigma^R(E) \\right]^{-1}\n$$\nHere, $G_{0,dd}^R(E)$ is the retarded Green's function of the isolated dot, given by:\n$$\nG_{0,dd}^R(E) = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_0 + i\\eta}\n$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal. The self-energy $\\Sigma^R(E)$ accounts for the coupling of the dot to the leads. It is given by:\n$$\n\\Sigma^R(E) = \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\{L,R\\}} \\sum_{k} \\frac{|V_{k\\alpha}|^2}{E - \\epsilon_{k\\alpha} + i\\eta}\n$$\nThe imaginary part of the self-energy is related to the hybridization functions $\\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E)$. Using the Sokhotski-Plemelj theorem, $\\frac{1}{x \\pm i\\eta} = \\mathcal{P}\\frac{1}{x} \\mp i\\pi\\delta(x)$, we find:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Im}[\\Sigma^R(E)] = -\\pi \\sum_{\\alpha, k} |V_{k\\alpha}|^2 \\delta(E - \\epsilon_{k\\alpha}) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\alpha} \\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E)\n$$\nThe real part of the self-energy, $\\mathrm{Re}[\\Sigma^R(E)]$, is a principal value integral that represents an energy-dependent shift of the dot level $\\epsilon_0$. In the wide-band approximation, it is standard to assume this shift is constant and can be absorbed into a renormalized level energy, which we take to be the given $\\epsilon_0$. Therefore, we set $\\mathrm{Re}[\\Sigma^R(E)] = 0$.\n\nIn the wide-band limit, with $\\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E) = \\Gamma_{\\alpha}$, the self-energy becomes a constant complex number:\n$$\n\\Sigma^R(E) = -\\frac{i}{2} (\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R) = -i\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma \\equiv \\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R$.

The maximum value, $T_{\\max}$, occurs when the denominator is minimal, which happens at the resonance energy $E = \\epsilon_0$.\n$$\nT_{\\max} = T(E=\\epsilon_0) = \\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\epsilon_0 - \\epsilon_0)^2 + (\\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2})^2} = \\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}\\right)^2}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\max} = \\frac{4 \\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2}\n$$\n\n(iii) Full width at half maximum, $\\mathrm{FWHM}$:\n\nThe $\\mathrm{FWHM}$ is the energy width of the resonance peak at half of its maximum height, $T(E) = \\frac{1}{2} T_{\\max}$. Let the energies at which this occurs be $E_{\\pm}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(E_{\\pm} - \\epsilon_0)^2 + (\\frac{\\Gamma}{2})^2} = \\frac{1}{2} T_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\frac{\\Gamma}{2})^2}\n$$\nCanceling the common factor $\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R$ and inverting both sides gives:\n$$\n(E_{\\pm} - \\epsilon_0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\\right)^2 = 2 \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n(E_{\\pm} - \\epsilon_0)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\\right)^2\n$$\nTaking the square root, we get $E_{\\pm} - \\epsilon_0 = \\pm \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}$, which gives the two energies $E_{\\pm} = \\epsilon_0 \\pm \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}$.

The Heaviside function $\\Theta(E - E_n)$ is non-zero only for $E > E_n$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\Theta(E - E_n) \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E}\\right) dE = \\int_{E_n}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E}\\right) dE\n$$\nThe integral of $-\\partial f/\\partial E$ is simply $-f(E)$. Evaluating at the limits:\n$$\n\\int_{E_n}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E}\\right) dE = \\left[-f(E)\\right]_{E_n}^{\\infty} = -f(\\infty) - (-f(E_n))\n$$\nAs $E \\to \\infty$, the exponent in the Fermi function goes to $+\\infty$, so $f(\\infty) \\to 0$. Thus, the integral for each term simplifies to:\n$$\n\\int_{E_n}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E}\\right) dE = 0 + f(E_n) = f(E_n)\n$$\nTherefore, the total normalized conductance is the sum of the Fermi-Dirac occupation factors evaluated at each subband threshold energy:\n$$\ng = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f(E_n) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_n - \\mu}{k_{B} T}\\right)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values. First, we calculate the thermal energy $k_B T$ in units of meV. Using the Boltzmann constant $k_B \\approx 8.61733 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K} = 8.61733 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{meV/K}$:\n$$\nk_B T = (8.61733 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{meV/K}) \\times (15\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 1.2926\\,\\mathrm{meV}\n$$\nThe subband energies are $E_n = n \\Delta$ with $\\Delta = 4\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ for $n=0, 1, ..., 5$:\n$E_0 = 0\\,\\mathrm{meV}$\n$E_1 = 4\\,\\mathrm{meV}$\n$E_2 = 8\\,\\mathrm{meV}$\n$E_3 = 12\\,\\mathrm{meV}$\n$E_4 = 16\\,\\mathrm{meV}$\n$E_5 = 20\\,\\mathrm{meV}$\n\nThe chemical potential is $\\mu = 16\\,\\mathrm{meV}$. We can now compute each term $f(E_n)$:\nFor $n=0$: $\\frac{E_0 - \\mu}{k_B T} = \\frac{0 - 16}{1.2926} \\approx -12.378$.\n$f(E_0) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-12.378)} \\approx 0.9999958$.\n\nFor $n=1$: $\\frac{E_1 - \\mu}{k_B T} = \\frac{4 - 16}{1.2926} \\approx -9.2835$.\n$f(E_1) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-9.2835)} \\approx 0.9999071$.\n\nFor $n=2$: $\\frac{E_2 - \\mu}{k_B T} = \\frac{8 - 16}{1.2926} \\approx -6.1890$.\n$f(E_2) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-6.1890)} \\approx 0.9979483$.\n\nFor $n=3$: $\\frac{E_3 - \\mu}{k_B T} = \\frac{12 - 16}{1.2926} \\approx -3.0945$.\n$f(E_3) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-3.0945)} \\approx 0.9566607$.\n\nFor $n=4$: $\\frac{E_4 - \\mu}{k_B T} = \\frac{16 - 16}{1.2926} = 0$.\n$f(E_4) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(0)} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\n\nFor $n=5$: $\\frac{E_5 - \\mu}{k_B T} = \\frac{20 - 16}{1.2926} \\approx 3.0945$.\n$f(E_5) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(3.0945)} \\approx 0.0433393$.\n\nThe total dimensionless conductance is the sum of these values:\n$$\ng = f(E_0) + f(E_1) + f(E_2) + f(E_3) + f(E_4) + f(E_5)\n$$\n$$\ng \\approx 0.9999958 + 0.9999071 + 0.9979483 + 0.9566607 + 0.5 + 0.0433393\n$$\n$$\ng \\approx 4.4978512\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $4.498$.",
