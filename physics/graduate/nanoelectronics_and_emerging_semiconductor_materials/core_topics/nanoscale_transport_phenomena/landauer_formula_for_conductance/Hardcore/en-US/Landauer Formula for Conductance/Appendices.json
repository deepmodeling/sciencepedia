It is a valid, well-defined problem in physics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as requested: first, a dimensional analysis of the terms in the Landauer formula, and second, a numerical calculation of the conductance prefactor.\n\n**Part 1: Dimensional Analysis**\n\nThe total conductance is given by the expression $G = \\frac{2 e^{2}}{h} \\sum_{n} T_{n}$. For this equation to be dimensionally consistent, the right-hand side must have the units of conductance. We will analyze the dimensions of the summation term and the prefactor separately.\n\nFirst, consider the term $\\sum_{n} T_{n}$. The quantity $T_n$ is defined as the transmission probability for the $n$-th mode. A probability is a ratio of like quantities (e.g., transmitted flux over incident flux) and is therefore a pure, dimensionless number. A summation of dimensionless numbers, $\\sum_{n} T_{n}$, results in a dimensionless quantity. Therefore, the term $\\sum_{n} T_{n}$ is dimensionless.\n\nNext, we analyze the dimensions of the prefactor, $\\frac{2 e^{2}}{h}$. The factor of $2$ arises from spin degeneracy and is a dimensionless pure number. We denote the dimensions of a physical quantity $X$ by $[X]$. The elementary charge $e$ has the dimension of charge, $[e] = Q$, which is the Coulomb ($C$) in SI units. Planck's constant $h$ has dimensions of energy multiplied by time, $[h] = E \\cdot T$. In SI units, this is Joule-second ($J \\cdot s$). The dimensions of the prefactor are therefore:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{e^2}{h}\\right] = \\frac{[e]^2}{[h]} = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T}\n$$\nIn SI units, this is $\\frac{C^2}{J \\cdot s}$.\n\nNow, we must verify that these are the dimensions of conductance. Conductance $G$ is defined as the ratio of current $I$ to voltage $V$: $G = I/V$. The dimension of current, which is the rate of flow of charge, is $[I] = Q/T$. In SI units, this is Ampere ($A$), where $1\\,A = 1\\,C/s$. The dimension of voltage (electric potential difference), which is energy per unit charge, is $[V] = E/Q$. In SI units, this is Volt ($V$), where $1\\,V = 1\\,J/C$.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of conductance are:\n$$\n[G] = \\frac{[I]}{[V]} = \\frac{Q/T}{E/Q} = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T}\n$$\nIn SI units, this corresponds to $\\frac{C/s}{J/C} = \\frac{C^2}{J \\cdot s}$. This unit is defined as the Siemens ($S$).\n\nComparing the dimensions of the prefactor $\\frac{e^2}{h}$ with the dimensions of conductance $G$, we find they are identical.\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{e^2}{h}\\right] = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad [G] = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T}\n$$\nThis confirms that the prefactor $\\frac{2e^2}{h}$ has units of conductance. Since the summation term is dimensionless, the entire expression for $G$ correctly has the units of conductance, validating the dimensional consistency of the Landauer formula.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the numerical value of the prefactor, which is known as the quantum of conductance, $G_0 = \\frac{2 e^2}{h}$.\nThe given values for the constants are:\n- Elementary charge, $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,C$.\n- Planck's constant, $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,J \\cdot s$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the expression for $G_0$:\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{2 e^2}{h} = \\frac{2 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,C)^2}{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,J \\cdot s}\n$$\nLet's calculate the numerical value:\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{2 \\times (1.602176634)^2 \\times 10^{-38}}{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}} \\frac{C^2}{J \\cdot s}\n$$\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{2 \\times 2.566970054...}{6.62607015} \\times 10^{-4} \\, S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{5.133940108...}{6.62607015} \\times 10^{-4} \\, S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 \\approx 0.7748091729... \\times 10^{-4} \\, S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 \\approx 7.748091729... \\times 10^{-5} \\, S\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in microsiemens ($\\mu S$). The conversion is $1\\,S = 10^6\\,\\mu S$.\n$$\nG_0 \\approx (7.748091729... \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 10^6 \\, \\mu S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 \\approx 77.48091729... \\, \\mu S\n$$\nFinally, we must round the result to five significant figures. The first five significant figures are $7, 7, 4, 8, 0$. The sixth digit is $9$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fifth digit.\n$$\nG_0 \\approx 77.481 \\, \\mu S\n$$",

By relating the geometry of the Fermi surface to the area of the contact, you will derive the famous Sharvin formula, which expresses $M$ in terms of the contact area $A$ and the material's Fermi wavevector $k_F$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the number of orbital transport channels per spin, denoted by $M$, for a ballistic point contact of area $A$ at the Fermi energy. The derivation will be based on counting the allowed quantum states in wavevector space, consistent with the given physical constraints.\n\nFirst, we are given the isotropic parabolic dispersion relation for electrons in the three-dimensional conductors:\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^{2} k^{2}}{2 m^{\\star}}$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{k} = (k_{x}, k_{y}, k_{z})$ is the wavevector, $k = |\\mathbf{k}| = \\sqrt{k_{x}^{2} + k_{y}^{2} + k_{z}^{2}}$ is its magnitude, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $m^{\\star}$ is the effective mass.\n\nAll transport phenomena at zero temperature occur at the Fermi energy, $E_{F}$. The states contributing to transport must have an energy equal to $E_{F}$. This defines the Fermi surface in wavevector space $(\\mathbf{k}$-space). The equation for the Fermi surface is:\n$$E_{F} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2} k_{F}^{2}}{2 m^{\\star}}$$\nwhere $k_{F}$ is the Fermi wavevector. Any state on the Fermi surface satisfies:\n$$k_{x}^{2} + k_{y}^{2} + k_{z}^{2} = k_{F}^{2}$$\nThis equation describes a sphere of radius $k_{F}$ in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, which is the Fermi surface for this system.\n\nA transport channel, or mode, corresponds to a quantum state that can propagate through the contact. The transport direction is given as the $z$-axis. A state is considered propagating along the $z$-direction if its longitudinal wavevector component, $k_{z}$, is a real number. If $k_{z}$ were imaginary, the wavefunction would be an evanescent wave, decaying exponentially along $z$ and not contributing to the net current far from the contact.\n\nFrom the equation for the Fermi surface, we can express $k_{z}^{2}$ in terms of the transverse wavevector components, $(k_{x}, k_{y})$:\n$$k_{z}^{2} = k_{F}^{2} - (k_{x}^{2} + k_{y}^{2})$$\nThe condition for $k_{z}$ to be real is $k_{z}^{2} \\ge 0$. This imposes a constraint on the allowed values of $k_{x}$ and $k_{y}$ for any propagating state at the Fermi energy:\n$$k_{x}^{2} + k_{y}^{2} \\le k_{F}^{2}$$\nThis inequality defines the set of all possible transverse wavevectors $(k_{x}, k_{y})$ that correspond to propagating modes. Geometrically, this region is a disk of radius $k_{F}$ centered at the origin in the transverse $\\mathbf{k}$-space plane (the $k_{x}$-$k_{y}$ plane). This disk is precisely the projection of the spherical Fermi surface onto the contact plane, as mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nThe quantity $M$ is the number of allowed orbital states (per spin) within this disk. To count these states, we use the semiclassical approximation for a large contact area $A$. In this approximation, the quantum states in the transverse $k_x$-$k_y$ plane are uniformly distributed. The density of states in this $2$-dimensional $\\mathbf{k}$-space is given by $\\frac{A}{(2\\pi)^2}$. This means that in a differential area $dk_{x} dk_{y}$ of the transverse $\\mathbf{k}$-space, there are $\\frac{A}{(2\\pi)^2} dk_{x} dk_{y}$ orbital states.\n\nTo find the total number of modes $M$, we integrate this density of states over the entire allowed region, which is the disk of radius $k_{F}$:\n$$M = \\iint_{k_{x}^{2} + k_{y}^{2} \\le k_{F}^{2}} \\frac{A}{(2\\pi)^{2}} dk_{x} dk_{y}$$\nWe can factor out the constant term $\\frac{A}{(2\\pi)^{2}}$ from the integral:\n$$M = \\frac{A}{(2\\pi)^{2}} \\iint_{k_{x}^{2} + k_{y}^{2} \\le k_{F}^{2}} dk_{x} dk_{y}$$\nThe remaining integral, $\\iint_{k_{x}^{2} + k_{y}^{2} \\le k_{F}^{2}} dk_{x} dk_{y}$, represents the area of the disk of radius $k_{F}$ in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane. The area of this disk is $\\pi k_{F}^{2}$.\n\nSubstituting this area back into the expression for $M$, we get:\n$$M = \\frac{A}{(2\\pi)^{2}} (\\pi k_{F}^{2})$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final result:\n$$M = \\frac{A \\pi k_{F}^{2}}{4 \\pi^{2}} = \\frac{A k_{F}^{2}}{4\\pi}$$\nThis is the Sharvin mode count, representing the number of orbital transport channels per spin for a ballistic contact of area $A$.
