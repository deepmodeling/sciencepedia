            "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the dependence of the charging energy $E_C$ of a spherical nanoisland on the permittivity of the surrounding medium, and for the calculation of the ratio of charging energies in liquid helium versus vacuum.\n\nFirst, we derive the capacitance $C$ of an isolated spherical conductor of radius $R$ embedded in an infinite, homogeneous dielectric medium with permittivity $\\varepsilon$. Let the conductor hold a charge $Q$. By symmetry, the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ and the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ must be purely radial. We apply Gauss's law for the displacement field to a spherical Gaussian surface of radius $r \\ge R$ concentric with the conductor:\n$$ \\oint_S \\mathbf{D} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = Q_{\\mathrm{free}} $$\nGiven the spherical symmetry, $\\mathbf{D}$ is uniform in magnitude over the Gaussian surface and parallel to the area element vector $d\\mathbf{A}$. The integral simplifies to $D(r) \\cdot 4\\pi r^2 = Q$, where $Q$ is the free charge on the conductor. Thus, the magnitude of the displacement field for $r \\ge R$ is:\n$$ D(r) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi r^2} $$\nThe electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is related to the displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ by the constitutive relation $\\mathbf{D} = \\varepsilon\\mathbf{E}$. Therefore, the electric field for $r \\ge R$ is:\n$$ E(r) = \\frac{D(r)}{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon r^2} $$\nThe electrostatic potential $V$ of the conductor is determined by integrating the electric field from a reference point at infinity (where $V=0$) to the surface of the sphere ($r=R$):\n$$ V = -\\int_{\\infty}^{R} E(r) dr = -\\int_{\\infty}^{R} \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon r^2} dr $$\nEvaluating the integral yields:\n$$ V = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon} \\left[ \\frac{1}{r} \\right]_{\\infty}^{R} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{1}{R} - 0 \\right) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon R} $$\nThe capacitance $C$ of an isolated conductor is defined as the ratio of its charge to its potential, $C = Q/V$. Using the expression for $V$, we find the capacitance of the spherical nanoisland:\n$$ C = \\frac{Q}{Q/(4\\pi\\varepsilon R)} = 4\\pi \\varepsilon R $$\nThis expression shows that the capacitance is directly proportional to the permittivity $\\varepsilon$ of the medium.\n\nNext, we address the charging energy $E_C$. As derived in the main text from the second finite difference of the electrostatic energy, the charging energy is given by:\n$$ E_C = \\frac{e^2}{C} $$\nSubstituting our derived expression for the capacitance $C$, we find the dependence of the charging energy on the permittivity $\\varepsilon$:\n$$ E_C = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon R} $$\nThis result shows that the charging energy $E_C$ is inversely proportional to the permittivity $\\varepsilon$ of the surrounding medium.\n\nNow, we can compute the ratio $E_C^{\\mathrm{He}}/E_C^{\\mathrm{vac}}$.\nIn vacuum, the permittivity is $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_0$, the permittivity of free space. The charging energy is:\n$$ E_{C}^{\\mathrm{vac}} = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} $$\nIn liquid helium, the medium has a relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_r = 1.057$. The absolute permittivity is $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{He}} = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$. The charging energy in liquid helium is:\n$$ E_{C}^{\\mathrm{He}} = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{He}} R} = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 R} $$\nThe ratio of the charging energy in helium to that in vacuum is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{E_{C}^{\\mathrm{He}}}{E_{C}^{\\mathrm{vac}}} = \\frac{\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 R}}{\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}} $$\nThe common terms $e^2$, $4$, $\\pi$, $\\varepsilon_0$, and $R$ cancel, yielding:\n$$ \\frac{E_{C}^{\\mathrm{He}}}{E_{C}^{\\mathrm{vac}}} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_r} $$\nSubstituting the given value $\\varepsilon_r = 1.057$:\n$$ \\frac{E_{C}^{\\mathrm{He}}}{E_{C}^{\\mathrm{vac}}} = \\frac{1}{1.057} \\approx 0.9460737937... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.
