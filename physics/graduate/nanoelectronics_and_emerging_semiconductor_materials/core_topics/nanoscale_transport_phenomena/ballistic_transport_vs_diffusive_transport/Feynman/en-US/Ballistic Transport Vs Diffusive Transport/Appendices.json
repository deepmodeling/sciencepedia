The BTE, in the absence of external forces within the channel and in steady-state, is given by $v_x \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}\\right)_{\\text{coll}}$.\n\nThe collision term represents elastic, isotropic backscattering. For the right-moving population $f_{+}(x,E)$, carriers scatter out of these states at a rate proportional to $f_{+}$ and scatter into them from the left-moving population $f_{-}(x,E)$ at a rate proportional to $f_{-}$. The scattering rate is determined by the group velocity $v(E)$ and the mean free path $\\ell$, as $\\tau^{-1} = v/\\ell$, where $\\tau$ is the scattering time.\n\nThe collision term for $f_{+}$ is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_{+}}{\\partial t}\\right)_{\\text{coll}} = -\\frac{v}{\\ell} f_{+} + \\frac{v}{\\ell} f_{-} = \\frac{v}{\\ell} (f_{-} - f_{+}) $$\nSimilarly, the collision term for $f_{-}$ is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_{-}}{\\partial t}\\right)_{\\text{coll}} = -\\frac{v}{\\ell} f_{-} + \\frac{v}{\\ell} f_{+} = \\frac{v}{\\ell} (f_{+} - f_{-}) $$\n\nFor right-moving carriers, the velocity is $v_x = v(E)$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mesoscopic physics, specifically the Landauer-Büttiker formalism for ballistic transport. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information and assumptions to derive a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three components: first, a derivation of the two-terminal conductance $G$ of a ballistic quantum point contact (QPC) at zero temperature; second, a numerical evaluation of this conductance for a specific case; and third, a conceptual explanation of how partial transmission modifies the conductance characteristics compared to ideal ballistic and diffusive transport.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Two-Terminal Conductance**\n\nThe net electrical current $I$ flowing through the QPC is the difference between the current from the left reservoir (L) to the right reservoir (R), $I_{\\mathrm{L} \\to \\mathrm{R}}$, and the current from right to left, $I_{\\mathrm{R} \\to \\mathrm{L}}$.\n$$I = I_{\\mathrm{L} \\to \\mathrm{R}} - I_{\\mathrm{R} \\to \\mathrm{L}}$$\nLet us derive the current carried by a single one-dimensional (1D) transport channel. The flux of charge carriers in an infinitesimal energy window $dE$ is the product of the number of carriers and their velocity.\nFor a 1D system of length $L$, the density of states in $k$-space is uniform, with one state per $\\Delta k = 2\\pi/L$. The number of states in an interval $dk$ is $dN = (L/2\\pi) dk$. We are interested in carriers moving in one direction, say $+k$, so we consider only half of these states, or we can account for it by integrating over positive velocities only. For a single spin, the 1D density of states per unit length for a given direction of motion is:\n$$D_{1D, 1-dir}(E) = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{dN}{dE} = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{dN}{dk} \\frac{dk}{dE}$$\nWith $\\frac{dN}{dk} = \\frac{L}{2\\pi}$ and the group velocity $v_g(E) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{dE}{dk}$, we have $\\frac{dk}{dE} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar v_g(E)}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $D_{1D, 1-dir}(E)$ yields:\n$$D_{1D, 1-dir}(E) = \\frac{1}{L} \\left(\\frac{L}{2\\pi}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\hbar v_g(E)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\hbar v_g(E)}$$\nThe number of charge carriers per unit length in the energy window $dE$ is given by the density of states multiplied by the Fermi-Dirac occupation function $f(E, \\mu)$. The charge current $dI$ contribution from this energy window is the charge $e$ times the carrier density per unit length times their velocity $v_g(E)$:\n$$dI(E) = e \\cdot v_g(E) \\cdot [D_{1D, 1-dir}(E) f(E, \\mu)] dE$$\nSubstituting the expression for $D_{1D, 1-dir}(E)$:\n$$dI(E) = e \\cdot v_g(E) \\cdot \\left[\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\hbar v_g(E)} f(E, \\mu)\\right] dE = \\frac{e}{2\\pi\\hbar} f(E, \\mu) dE = \\frac{e}{h} f(E, \\mu) dE$$\nA notable result is that the group velocity $v_g(E)$ cancels, rendering the current contribution per unit energy interval independent of the material's specific band structure $E(k)$.\n\nNow, we apply this to the QPC. For a given mode $n$ with transmission probability $T_n(E)$, carriers originating from the left reservoir are described by the occupation function $f(E, \\mu_{\\mathrm{L}})$. The current they contribute to the right reservoir is:\n$$I_{n, \\mathrm{L} \\to \\mathrm{R}} = \\int_0^\\infty T_n(E) \\frac{e}{h} f(E, \\mu_{\\mathrm{L}}) dE$$\nSimilarly, the current from the right reservoir, with occupation $f(E, \\mu_{\\mathrm{R}})$, flowing to the left is:\n$$I_{n, \\mathrm{R} \\to \\mathrm{L}} = \\int_0^\\infty T_n(E) \\frac{e}{h} f(E, \\mu_{\\mathrm{R}}) dE$$\nThe net current for this single-spin mode is $I_n = I_{n, \\mathrm{L} \\to \\mathrm{R}} - I_{n, \\mathrm{R} \\to \\mathrm{L}}$.\nThe problem states that spin degeneracy is preserved, so we must include a spin-degeneracy factor $g_s = 2$. The total current $I$ is the sum over all $M$ transverse modes, including spin:\n$$I = \\sum_{n=1}^{M} g_s \\left( I_{n, \\mathrm{L} \\to \\mathrm{R}} - I_{n, \\mathrm{R} \\to \\mathrm{L}} \\right) = \\frac{2e}{h} \\sum_{n=1}^{M} \\int_0^\\infty T_n(E) [f(E, \\mu_{\\mathrm{L}}) - f(E, \\mu_{\\mathrm{R}})] dE$$\nWe now apply the given conditions. At zero temperature ($T=0$), the Fermi-Dirac distribution is a step function: $f(E, \\mu) = \\Theta(\\mu - E)$.\nThe difference term $[f(E, \\mu_{\\mathrm{L}}) - f(E, \\mu_{\\mathrm{R}})]$ is non-zero only in the energy window between the two electrochemical potentials. With $\\mu_{\\mathrm{L}}  \\mu_{\\mathrm{R}}$, this difference is $1$ for $\\mu_{\\mathrm{R}}  E  \\mu_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $0$ otherwise. The integral simplifies to:\n$$I = \\frac{2e}{h} \\sum_{n=1}^{M} \\int_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{R}}}^{\\mu_{\\mathrm{L}}} T_n(E) dE$$\nThe problem specifies a small applied bias $V$, which corresponds to the linear response regime. In this regime, the energy window $\\mu_{\\mathrm{L}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{R}} = eV$ is small, and we can assume the transmission probabilities $T_n(E)$ are constant over this interval and equal to their value at the Fermi energy, $T_n(E_F)$, which we denote simply as $T_n$.\n$$I = \\frac{2e}{h} \\sum_{n=1}^{M} T_n \\int_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{R}}}^{\\mu_{\\mathrm{L}}} dE = \\frac{2e}{h} \\sum_{n=1}^{M} T_n (\\mu_{\\mathrm{L}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{R}})$$\nUsing the relation $\\mu_{\\mathrm{L}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{R}} = eV$:\n$$I = \\frac{2e}{h} \\sum_{n=1}^{M} T_n (eV) = \\left( \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\sum_{n=1}^{M} T_n \\right) V$$\nThe linear-response conductance $G$ is defined by Ohm's law, $G = I/V$. Therefore, the derived expression for the conductance is:\n$$G = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\sum_{n=1}^{M} T_n$$\nThis is the celebrated Landauer formula for a two-terminal conductor. The quantity $G_Q = 2e^2/h$ is the quantum of conductance, including spin.\n\n**2. Numerical Evaluation of Conductance**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate $G$ for the case of $M = 7$ propagating modes, each with perfect transmission, $T_n = 1$ for all $n=1, \\dots, 7$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$G = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\sum_{n=1}^{7} 1 = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\times 7 = \\frac{14e^2}{h}$$\nUsing the fundamental physical constants $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{C}$ and $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\mathrm{J \\cdot s}$:\n$$G = 14 \\times \\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19})^2}{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}} \\, \\mathrm{S}$$\n$$G \\approx 14 \\times (7.7480917 \\times 10^{-5}) \\, \\mathrm{S} \\approx 5.4236642 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{S}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$G \\approx 5.424 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{S}$$\n\n**3. Effect of Partial Transmission: Ballistic vs. Diffusive Transport**\n\nThe derived expression $G = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\sum T_n$ provides direct insight into the nature of quantized conductance and how it is modified by imperfect transmission.\n\nIn an ideal **ballistic** conductor, as a gate voltage is swept to widen the QPC, transverse modes open up sequentially. When a mode is fully open, its transmission is perfect, $T_n=1$. The total conductance is $G = M \\frac{2e^2}{h}$, where $M$ is the integer number of open modes. As $M$ jumps from $k-1$ to $k$, the conductance abruptly jumps by one conductance quantum, $\\Delta G = \\frac{2e^2}{h}$. This results in a plot of $G$ versus gate voltage that shows a series of perfectly flat plateaus at integer multiples of $G_Q$, separated by sharp vertical steps.\n\nWhen **partial transmission ($T_n  1$)** is introduced, the situation changes. This can occur due to scattering from imperfections or quantum-mechanical reflection at the entrance and exit of the constriction. The conductance is $G = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\sum_{n=1}^{M} T_n$.\nThe key modifications are:\n1.  **Reduced Step Height:** The height of the step associated with the opening of the $n$-th mode is now $\\frac{2e^2}{h} T_n$, which is less than the ideal quantum $G_Q$ if $T_n  1$.\n2.  **Sloped Risers:** The transition of a mode from being closed ($T_n=0$) to open ($T_n  1$) is often gradual as a function of gate voltage, not abrupt. This leads to sloped risers between the plateaus.\n3.  **Non-Quantized Plateaus:** The plateaus are no longer at exact integer multiples of $G_Q$, but at $G = G_Q \\sum T_n$.\n\nIn sharp contrast, **diffusive transport** occurs when the conductor length is much longer than the electron mean free path ($L \\gg l_m$). Frequent elastic and inelastic scattering events randomize the electron's momentum and phase. In this regime, the concept of discrete, independent transport modes is lost. The conductance is described by the classical Drude model and Ohm's law, $G = \\sigma \\frac{A}{L}$, where $\\sigma$ is the material conductivity. The conductivity is proportional to carrier density, $\\sigma \\propto n$. As a gate voltage tunes the carrier density $n$, the conductance $G$ changes smoothly and typically linearly. There are no quantized steps or plateaus.\n\nTherefore, the presence of partial transmission ($T_n  1$) in a ballistic conductor degrades the perfect quantization, resulting in smeared steps of reduced height. However, the very existence of a step-like structure in the conductance is the defining characteristic of ballistic or quasi-ballistic transport, signifying the discreteness of the underlying transport channels. This is fundamentally different from the smooth, continuous behavior of a diffusive conductor.",

To obtain the requested simplified analytic expression, we substitute the given numerical values: $L = 100\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $v_F = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s}^{-1}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}} = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{ps} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{s}$, and $\\alpha = 3.0 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the composite terms. The numerator term is $v_F \\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}$:\n$$\nv_F \\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s}^{-1})(1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe dimensionless prefactor, which corresponds to the Knudsen number at $T=0\\ \\mathrm{K}$, is $v_F \\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}} / L$:\n$$\n\\frac{v_F \\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}}{L} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 10\n$$\nThe term multiplying $T$ in the denominator is $\\alpha \\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}$:\n$$\n\\alpha \\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}} = (3.0 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1})(1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1} = 0.03\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}\n$$\nSubstituting these numerical results into the expression for $Kn(T)$ yields the simplified form, which is a dimensionless quantity depending only on $T$:\n$$\nKn(T) = \\frac{10}{1 + 0.03 T}\n$$\n\nThe second task is to determine the transition temperature $T^{\\ast}$ at which $Kn(T^{\\ast}) = 1$. We set the derived expression equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\frac{10}{1 + 0.03 T^{\\ast}} = 1\n$$\nSolving for $T^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n10 = 1 + 0.03 T^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n9 = 0.03 T^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\nT^{\\ast} = \\frac{9}{0.03}\\ \\mathrm{K} = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe calculated transition temperature is exactly $300\\ \\mathrm{K}$. This value is consistent with the requirement to round to three significant figures.\n\nThe two requested results are the expression for $Kn(T)$ and the value for $T^{\\ast}$.",
