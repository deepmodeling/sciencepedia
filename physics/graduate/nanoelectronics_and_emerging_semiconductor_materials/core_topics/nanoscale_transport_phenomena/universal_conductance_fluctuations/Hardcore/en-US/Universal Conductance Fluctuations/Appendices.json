The material has a three-dimensional electron density $n$ and a parabolic conduction band so that the Fermi wavevector $k_F$ can be obtained from $n$. Phase coherence is limited by electron-electron Nyquist dephasing in the quasi-one-dimensional limit, with a dephasing rate that follows a power law in temperature.\n\nStarting from the following foundational relations:\n- The elastic scattering time is defined by $l = v_F \\tau$.\n- The diffusion constant in three spatial dimensions is $D = \\frac{v_F^2 \\tau}{3}$.\n- The phase-coherence length is $L_{\\phi} = \\sqrt{D \\tau_{\\phi}}$.\n- The Nyquist dephasing rate in quasi-one-dimensional conductors is modeled as $\\tau_{\\phi}^{-1} = A T^{2/3}$, where $A$ is a material- and geometry-dependent prefactor.\n- For a three-dimensional electron gas with a parabolic dispersion, $k_F = \\left(3 \\pi^2 n\\right)^{1/3}$.\n\nUniversal Conductance Fluctuations (UCF) are expected when the system is in the diffusive mesoscopic regime, which requires simultaneously $l \\ll L$, $L \\lesssim L_{\\phi}$, and transverse dimensions smaller than the phase-coherence length, $W \\ll L_{\\phi}$, together with a metallic diffusive condition $k_F l \\gg 1$.\n\nDefine the decision indicator for UCF occurrence by\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{UCF}} = \\Theta\\!\\left(L - l\\right)\\,\\Theta\\!\\left(L_{\\phi} - L\\right)\\,\\Theta\\!\\left(L_{\\phi} - W\\right)\\,\\Theta\\!\\left(k_F l - 1\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function defined to be $\\Theta(x) = 1$ for $x \\ge 0$ and $\\Theta(x) = 0$ for $x < 0$.\n\nThe nanowire parameters are:\n- $L = 0.60 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$,\n- $W = 40 \\,\\mathrm{nm}$,\n- $l = 25 \\,\\mathrm{nm}$,\n- $v_F = 1.2 \\times 10^{5} \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$,\n- $n = 1.0 \\times 10^{24} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$,\n- $T = 0.50 \\,\\mathrm{K}$,\n- $A = 1.5 \\times 10^{9} \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-2/3}$.\n\nCompute $I_{\\mathrm{UCF}}$ using the above definitions and parameters.

Conductance of Series Incoherent Conductors**\n\nFor two conductors connected in series where phase coherence is broken at the junction, their total resistance is the sum of their individual resistances, $R_p = R_A + R_B$. In terms of conductance ($G=1/R$), this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{G_p} = \\frac{1}{g_A} + \\frac{1}{g_B} $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ G_p(g_A, g_B) = \\frac{g_A g_B}{g_A + g_B} $$\n\n**3. Propagation of Fluctuations**\n\nWe are interested in the variance of $G_p$, which arises from the fluctuations of $g_A$ and $g_B$. For small fluctuations, we can use a first-order Taylor expansion for the fluctuation $\\delta G_p$ around the mean values $\\langle g_A \\rangle$ and $\\langle g_B \\rangle$.\n$$ \\delta G_p \\approx \\frac{\\partial G_p}{\\partial g_A} \\delta g_A + \\frac{\\partial G_p}{\\partial g_B} \\delta g_B $$\nwhere the partial derivatives are evaluated at the mean values of $g_A$ and $g_B$.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives of $G_p(g_A, g_B)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial G_p}{\\partial g_A} = \\frac{g_B(g_A + g_B) - g_A g_B(1)}{(g_A + g_B)^2} = \\frac{g_B^2}{(g_A + g_B)^2} = \\left(\\frac{g_B}{g_A+g_B}\\right)^2 $$\nBy symmetry:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial G_p}{\\partial g_B} = \\left(\\frac{g_A}{g_A+g_B}\\right)^2 $$\nSince the probe is at the midpoint and the wire is uniform, the two segments are identical.

The crucial role of the ideal dephasing probe is to make the fluctuations in Wire A and Wire B statistically independent. For independent variables, the covariance is zero:\n$$ \\langle \\delta g_A \\delta g_B \\rangle = \\langle \\delta g_A \\rangle \\langle \\delta g_B \\rangle = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nTherefore, the variance becomes:\n$$ \\text{Var}(G_p) = \\frac{1}{16} (\\text{Var}(g_A) + \\text{Var}(g_B)) $$\n\n**5.

Wire A and Wire B are themselves long diffusive wires. Thus, their individual conductance variances are also equal to the universal value:\n$$ \\text{Var}(g_A) = \\sigma_{ucf}^2 $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(g_B) = \\sigma_{ucf}^2 $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\text{Var}(G_p)$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(G_p) = \\frac{1}{16} (\\sigma_{ucf}^2 + \\sigma_{ucf}^2) = \\frac{2}{16} \\sigma_{ucf}^2 = \\frac{1}{8} \\sigma_{ucf}^2 $$\n\n**6.

The system is at zero temperature.\n\nThe dimensionless conductance, $g$, is defined in units of the spin-degenerate conductance quantum as $g = G / (2e^2/h)$, where $G$ is the electrical conductance, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n\nDue to quantum interference, the conductance of a specific dot fluctuates as a function of external parameters (like the Fermi energy) or from sample to sample.
