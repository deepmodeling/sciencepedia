According to the orthodox model of a single-electron transistor (SET), the electrostatic energy $U$ of the central island with $n$ excess electrons is a function of the gate voltage $V_G$. Assuming the source and drain are held at ground potential ($V_S = V_D = 0$), this energy is given by:\n$$U(n, V_G) = \\frac{(C_G V_G - ne)^2}{2 C_{\\Sigma}}$$\nwhere $n$ is an integer representing the number of excess electrons on the island, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $C_{\\Sigma}$ is the total capacitance of the island, defined as $C_{\\Sigma} = C_G + C_S + C_D$. Here, $C_S$ and $C_D$ are the source and drain capacitances, respectively.\n\nConductance peaks occur when the system is at a charge degeneracy point, meaning the energy is the same for two adjacent charge states, $n$ and $n+1$.

The given capacitance values are physically realistic for nanoscale devices. The question is a standard exercise in nanoelectronics, requiring the derivation of the stability diagram boundaries and comparison to data, which is neither trivial nor ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Coulomb Diamond Edges\n\nThe stability of a charge state with $N$ excess electrons on the island is determined by the energetics of electron tunneling between the island and the leads (source and drain). At zero temperature, tunneling is only possible if it lowers the total free energy of the system. This leads to conditions on the electrochemical potentials of the source ($\\mu_s$), drain ($\\mu_d$), and the island.\n\nThe electrochemical potential of the island corresponding to the addition of an electron to the $N$-electron state (i.e., the $N \\to N+1$ transition) is given by $\\mu_{I}(N+1) = E(N+1) - E(N)$, where $E(N)$ is the electrostatic energy of the island with $N$ electrons. Using the constant interaction model, the total electrostatic energy is $E(N) = \\frac{(-Ne - Q_0)^2}{2C_\\Sigma}$, where $Q_0 = C_sV_s + C_dV_d + C_gV_g$ is the polarization charge induced by the external voltages.\n\nThe island's electrochemical potential for the transition from $N-1$ to $N$ electrons can be shown to be:\n$$ \\mu_{I}(N) = E(N) - E(N-1) = \\left(N - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{e^2}{C_\\Sigma} - \\frac{e}{C_\\Sigma}(C_sV_s + C_dV_d + C_gV_g) $$\nHere, $e$ is the elementary charge. The chemical potentials of the leads are $\\mu_s = -eV_s$ and $\\mu_d = -eV_d$.\n\nFor the state with $N$ electrons to be stable (i.e., for the system to be in Coulomb blockade), no tunneling can occur. This requires that the chemical potentials of both the source and drain lie outside the energy window defined by consecutive island potentials. Specifically, for state $N$ to be stable, we need $\\mu_I(N)$ and $\\mu_I(N+1)$ to straddle the window of lead potentials $[\\min(\\mu_s, \\mu_d), \\max(\\mu_s, \\mu_d)]$. That is, the energy window of the leads must not contain any island electrochemical potential. The conditions are:\n$$ \\mu_I(N) < \\min(\\mu_s, \\mu_d) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu_I(N+1) > \\max(\\mu_s, \\mu_d) $$\n\nApplying the given biasing conditions, $V_d = 0$ and $V_s = V_{sd}$, we have $\\mu_d = 0$ and $\\mu_s = -eV_{sd}$.\n\nCase 1: $V_{sd} > 0$.\nHere, $\\mu_s < \\mu_d$. So, $\\min(\\mu_s, \\mu_d) = \\mu_s = -eV_{sd}$ and $\\max(\\mu_s, \\mu_d) = \\mu_d = 0$. The stability conditions become:\n1.  $\\mu_I(N) < -eV_{sd}$\n2.  $\\mu_I(N+1) > 0$\n\nCase 2: $V_{sd} < 0$.\nHere, $\\mu_s > \\mu_d$. So, $\\min(\\mu_s, \\mu_d) = \\mu_d = 0$ and $\\max(\\mu_s, \\mu_d) = \\mu_s = -eV_{sd}$. The stability conditions become:\n3.  $\\mu_I(N) < 0$\n4.  $\\mu_I(N+1) > -eV_{sd}$\n\nThe boundaries of the Coulomb diamond are defined by turning these four inequalities into equalities. Let's find the slopes $\\mathrm{d}V_{sd}/\\mathrm{d}V_{g}$ for these boundary lines.\n\nThe expression for the island potential is:\n$$ \\mu_{I}(N) = \\left(N - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{e^2}{C_\\Sigma} - \\frac{e}{C_\\Sigma}(C_sV_{sd} + C_gV_g) $$\n\n**Boundary for Negative-Slope Edge:**\nThis edge is determined by the conditions involving the grounded drain, $\\mu_d=0$.\nFrom condition 2 ($V_{sd}>0$): $\\mu_I(N+1) = 0$.\n$$ \\left(N + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{e^2}{C_\\Sigma} - \\frac{e}{C_\\Sigma}(C_sV_{sd} + C_gV_g) = 0 $$\n$$ C_sV_{sd} + C_gV_g = \\left(N + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)e = \\text{const} $$\nFrom condition 3 ($V_{sd}<0$): $\\mu_I(N) = 0$.\n$$ \\left(N - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{e^2}{C_\\Sigma} - \\frac{e}{C_\\Sigma}(C_sV_{sd} + C_gV_g) = 0 $$\n$$ C_sV_{sd} + C_gV_g = \\left(N - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)e = \\text{const} $$\nBoth conditions give a line with the same slope. Differentiating $C_sV_{sd} + C_gV_g = \\text{const}$ with respect to $V_g$:\n$$ C_s \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{sd}}{\\mathrm{d}V_{g}} + C_g = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{sd}}{\\mathrm{d}V_{g}} = -\\frac{C_g}{C_s} $$\nThis is the slope of the negative-slope edge.\n\n**Boundary for Positive-Slope Edge:**\nThis edge is determined by the conditions involving the biased source, $\\mu_s=-eV_{sd}$.\nFrom condition 1 ($V_{sd}>0$): $\\mu_I(N) = -eV_{sd}$.\n$$ \\left(N - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{e^2}{C_\\Sigma} - \\frac{e}{C_\\Sigma}(C_sV_{sd} + C_gV_g) = -eV_{sd} $$\nDividing by $e$ and rearranging:\n$$ \\left(N - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{e}{C_\\Sigma} = \\frac{1}{C_\\Sigma}(C_sV_{sd} + C_gV_g) - V_{sd} = V_{sd}\\left(\\frac{C_s - C_\\Sigma}{C_\\Sigma}\\right) + V_g\\frac{C_g}{C_\\Sigma} $$\n$$ V_{sd} \\frac{C_s - (C_s+C_d+C_g)}{C_\\Sigma} + V_g\\frac{C_g}{C_\\Sigma} = \\text{const} $$\n$$ -V_{sd}(C_d+C_g) + V_g C_g = \\text{const} $$\nFrom condition 4 ($V_{sd}<0$): $\\mu_I(N+1) = -eV_{sd}$.

While the numerical values calculated in the option ($+\\,0.05$ and $-\\,0.20$) have magnitudes similar to the measurement, they are based on faulty formulas. The conclusion drawn is therefore unsound.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. **The positive-slope edge depends only on $C_{d}$ via $\\mathrm{d}V_{sd}/\\mathrm{d}V_{g} = +\\,C_{g}/C_{d} = +\\,0.25$, while the negative-slope edge depends only on $C_{s}$ via $\\mathrm{d}V_{sd}/\\mathrm{d}V_{g} = -\\,C_{g}/C_{s} = -\\,0.05$; the small discrepancy for the positive slope can be attributed to finite temperature, so the measurement is consistent.**\nThis option provides the correct formula for the negative-slope edge but an incorrect formula for the positive-slope edge. The correct formula is $\\mathrm{d}V_{sd}/\\mathrm{d}V_{g} = +\\,C_g/(C_d+C_g)$, not $+C_g/C_d$. The calculated value of $+0.25$ using the incorrect formula does not match the measurement of $+0.20$. Attributing this significant discrepancy ($25\\%$) to thermal broadening is not physically justified, as temperature primarily rounds the diamond tips rather than changing the fundamental slopes determined by the capacitive network.

The addition energy, $E_{\\mathrm{add}}(N) \\equiv \\mu(N+1) - \\mu(N)$, in this model separates into a charging energy $E_C = e^2/C_\\Sigma$ and a single-particle level spacing $\\Delta$ (with odd-even alternation when spin fills a single orbital), so that consecutive additions often satisfy $E_{\\mathrm{add},1} \\approx E_C + \\Delta$ and $E_{\\mathrm{add},2} \\approx E_C$.\n\nAn experimenter measures the gate-voltage spacing between two consecutive Coulomb peaks as $\\Delta V_g^{(1)} = 25\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $\\Delta V_g^{(2)} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and converts these to energies using an assumed lever arm $\\alpha_0 = 0.10$ via $E_{\\mathrm{add}} \\stackrel{?}{=} e\\alpha_0\\Delta V_g$. Independently, bias spectroscopy (differential conductance versus source-drain bias $V_{sd}$ and gate voltage $V_g$) reveals Coulomb diamond vertical extents at the corresponding charge states of $\\Delta V_{sd}^{(1)} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $\\Delta V_{sd}^{(2)} = 2.4\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Assume symmetric coupling and use the well-tested fact that, at the diamond vertex, $E_{\\mathrm{add}} = e\\,\\Delta V_{sd}$, which does not involve $\\alpha$.\n\nWhich option correctly identifies the true lever arm, quantifies the bias in the extracted $E_C$ and $\\Delta$ when using $\\alpha_0$, and proposes a valid cross-check using bias spectroscopy that does not rely on $\\alpha$?\n\nA. The true lever arm is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.12$. Using $\\alpha_0$ yields $E_C = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ and $\\Delta = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{meV}$, and both are underestimated by exactly $20\\%$. A sufficient cross-check is to read diamond heights only, which always give $E_C$ directly.\n\nB. The lever arm affects charging energy estimates but cancels out for level spacings, so $\\Delta$ is unaffected by an inaccurate $\\alpha$. The correct lever arm remains $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\alpha_0$. A reliable cross-check is zero-bias conductance versus temperature.\n\nC. The true lever arm is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{sd}^{(1)}}{\\Delta V_g^{(1)}} = \\frac{3.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{25\\,\\mathrm{mV}} = 0.12$ (consistent with the second pair, $2.4/20 = 0.12$). The true energies are $E_C = 2.4\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ and $\\Delta = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{meV}$, whereas using $\\alpha_0 = 0.10$ gives $E_C^{(0)} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ and $\\Delta^{(0)} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{meV}$; the fractional error is $\\alpha_0/\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.833\\ldots$, i.e., an underestimation by approximately $16.7\\%$. A robust cross-check that does not rely on $\\alpha$ is to extract $E_{\\mathrm{add}}$ from Coulomb diamond vertical spans ($E_{\\mathrm{add}} = e\\,\\Delta V_{sd}$) and to read excited-state lines at finite bias, whose separations in $V_{sd}$ directly give $\\Delta$ via $\\Delta = e\\,\\Delta V_{sd}$.\n\nD.

A cross-check is to use the diagonally oriented lines in bias spectroscopy to compute $\\alpha$ directly from their slope.",

While stated as an assumption, it is not strictly needed for the core calculation but is relevant for analyzing diamond slopes.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem describes a standard scenario in the experimental characterization of a quantum dot SET.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the well-established constant-interaction model of Coulomb blockade, a cornerstone of mesoscopic physics and nanoelectronics. All definitions ($E_{\\mathrm{el}}$, $\\alpha$, $E_C$, $E_{\\mathrm{add}}$) and relationships ($E_{\\mathrm{add}} = e\\alpha\\Delta V_g$, $E_{\\mathrm{add}} = e\\Delta V_{sd}$) are textbook material.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides two distinct experimental measurements of the same physical quantities (the addition energies). The discrepancy between the results obtained from these two methods, assuming an incorrect parameter ($\\alpha_0$), allows for the determination of the true parameter ($\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}$) and a quantitative analysis of the resulting error. The data is sufficient for a unique solution.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal and precise, using standard terminology from the field.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. The provided numerical values are physically realistic for semiconductor quantum dots. The setup is a consistent and standard exercise in data analysis in this field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. Proceeding with the derivation and evaluation.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of the problem is to reconcile two different measurements of the addition energies, $E_{\\mathrm{add}}$.\n\n1.  **Finding the True Lever Arm, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}$**\n    The addition energy required to add an electron to the dot can be compensated by a change in gate voltage, $\\Delta V_{g}$. The relationship is given by $E_{\\mathrm{add}} = e\\alpha\\Delta V_{g}$.\n    Alternatively, bias spectroscopy provides a direct measurement via the vertical height of the Coulomb diamond, $\\Delta V_{sd}$, where $E_{\\mathrm{add}} = e\\Delta V_{sd}$. The problem states this method does not involve $\\alpha$ and is well-tested, implying it is the reliable reference.\n    By equating these two expressions for the same physical quantity, we can find the true lever arm, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}$:\n    $$e\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}\\Delta V_{g} = e\\Delta V_{sd}$$\n    $$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{sd}}{\\Delta V_{g}}$$\n    Using the two provided data pairs, we can verify consistency:\n    For the first transition:\n    $$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}^{(1)} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{sd}^{(1)}}{\\Delta V_{g}^{(1)}} = \\frac{3.0\\ \\mathrm{mV}}{25\\ \\mathrm{mV}} = 0.12$$\n    For the second transition:\n    $$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}^{(2)} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{sd}^{(2)}}{\\Delta V_{g}^{(2)}} = \\frac{2.4\\ \\mathrm{mV}}{20\\ \\mathrm{mV}} = 0.12$$\n    The two measurements consistently yield $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.12$.\n\n2.  **Calculating True and Inferred Energies and Quantifying the Bias**\n    First, we determine the true physical parameters ($E_C$, $\\Delta$) using the reliable bias spectroscopy data. The elementary charge is $e$.\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{add},1} = e\\Delta V_{sd}^{(1)} = e(3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}) = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{meV}$$\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{add},2} = e\\Delta V_{sd}^{(2)} = e(2.4 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}) = 2.4\\ \\mathrm{meV}$$\n    From the problem statement, $E_{\\mathrm{add},2} \\approx E_{C}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{add},1} \\approx E_{C} + \\Delta$.\n    Thus, the true charging energy is $E_{C} = 2.4\\ \\mathrm{meV}$.\n    The true single-particle level spacing is $\\Delta = E_{\\mathrm{add},1} - E_{C} = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{meV} - 2.4\\ \\mathrm{meV} = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{meV}$.\n\n    Next, we calculate the inferred parameters ($E_{C}^{(0)}$, $\\Delta^{(0)}$) using the incorrect lever arm $\\alpha_{0} = 0.10$ and the gate sweep data.\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{add},1}^{(0)} = e\\alpha_{0}\\Delta V_{g}^{(1)} = e(0.10)(25 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}) = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{meV}$$\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{add},2}^{(0)} = e\\alpha_{0}\\Delta V_{g}^{(2)} = e(0.10)(20 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}) = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{meV}$$\n    From these, the inferred charging energy is $E_{C}^{(0)} = E_{\\mathrm{add},2}^{(0)} = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{meV}$.\n    The inferred level spacing is $\\Delta^{(0)} = E_{\\mathrm{add},1}^{(0)} - E_{C}^{(0)} = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{meV} - 2.0\\ \\mathrm{meV} = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{meV}$.\n\n    Now, we quantify the error. The ratio of the inferred value to the true value for any energy is:\n    $$\\frac{E^{(0)}}{E} = \\frac{e\\alpha_{0}\\Delta V_{g}}{e\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}\\Delta V_{g}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{0.10}{0.12} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.8333$$\n    This means the inferred energies are underestimated. The fractional error is $\\frac{E^{(0)} - E}{E} = \\frac{\\alpha_{0}}{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}} - 1 = \\frac{5}{6} - 1 = -\\frac{1}{6} \\approx -16.7\\%$.\n    Both $E_C$ and $\\Delta$ are underestimated by approximately $16.7\\%$.\n\n3.  **Proposing a Valid Cross-Check**\n    The question asks for a cross-check from bias spectroscopy that does not rely on $\\alpha$. The vertical diamond height, $e\\Delta V_{sd}$, already gives $E_{\\mathrm{add}}$ without needing $\\alpha$. To provide a cross-check for the individual components ($E_C$ and $\\Delta$), we need another $\\alpha$-independent feature. In finite-bias spectroscopy ($dI/dV_{sd}$ maps), in addition to the diamond edges defining the region of blockaded transport, one can observe additional lines parallel to these edges. These correspond to transport through excited states of the quantum dot. The energy separation between the ground state and the first excited state of the $(N+1)$-electron system is the single-particle level spacing, $\\Delta$. This energy separation is directly visible in the bias spectroscopy plot as the spacing in source-drain voltage, $\\Delta V_{sd}^{\\text{excited}}$, between the main diamond edge and the first excited-state line at a fixed gate voltage. Therefore, $\\Delta = e\\Delta V_{sd}^{\\text{excited}}$. This provides a direct measure of $\\Delta$ without involving $\\alpha$, which serves as an excellent cross-check.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The true lever arm is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.12$. Using $\\alpha_{0}$ yields $E_{C} = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{meV}$ and $\\Delta = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{meV}$, and both are underestimated by exactly $20\\%$. A sufficient cross-check is to read diamond heights only, which always give $E_{C}$ directly.**\n- The calculated $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.12$ is correct.\n- The inferred energies $E_{C}^{(0)} = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{meV}$ and $\\Delta^{(0)} = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{meV}$ are correct.\n- The claim of a $20\\%$ underestimation is incorrect. The underestimation is $1/6 \\approx 16.7\\%$.\n- The claim that diamond heights \"always give $E_C$ directly\" is incorrect. The height gives $E_{\\mathrm{add}}$, which can be $E_C$ or $E_C + \\Delta$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The lever arm affects charging energy estimates but cancels out for level spacings, so $\\Delta$ is unaffected by an inaccurate $\\alpha$. The correct lever arm remains $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\alpha_{0}$. A reliable cross-check is zero-bias conductance versus temperature.**\n- The claim that $\\Delta$ is unaffected by an inaccurate $\\alpha$ is incorrect. $\\Delta^{(0)} = E_{\\mathrm{add},1}^{(0)} - E_{\\mathrm{add},2}^{(0)} = e\\alpha_0 (\\Delta V_g^{(1)} - \\Delta V_g^{(2)})$, which is different from the true value $\\Delta = e\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} (\\Delta V_g^{(1)} - \\Delta V_g^{(2)})$.\n- The claim that $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\alpha_{0}$ is incorrect. We calculated $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.12$.\n- A temperature-dependent measurement is a valid way to find $\\alpha$ but it is not a *bias spectroscopy* method that is independent of $\\alpha$, as requested.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The true lever arm is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\dfrac{\\Delta V_{sd}^{(1)}}{\\Delta V_{g}^{(1)}} = \\dfrac{3.0\\ \\mathrm{mV}}{25\\ \\mathrm{mV}} = 0.12$ (consistent with the second pair, $2.4/20 = 0.12$). The true energies are $E_{C} = 2.4\\ \\mathrm{meV}$ and $\\Delta = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{meV}$, whereas using $\\alpha_{0} = 0.10$ gives $E_{C}^{(0)} = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{meV}$ and $\\Delta^{(0)} = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{meV}$; the fractional error is $\\alpha_{0}/\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.833\\ldots$, i.e., an underestimation by approximately $16.7\\%$. A robust cross-check that does not rely on $\\alpha$ is to extract $E_{\\mathrm{add}}$ from Coulomb diamond vertical spans ($E_{\\mathrm{add}} = e\\,\\Delta V_{sd}$) and to read excited-state lines at finite bias, whose separations in $V_{sd}$ directly give $\\Delta$ via $\\Delta = e\\,\\Delta V_{sd}$.**\n- The calculation for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}}$ is correct.\n- The values for the true energies ($E_C$, $\\Delta$) and the inferred energies ($E_{C}^{(0)}$, $\\Delta^{(0)}$) are all correct.\n- The analysis of the error as an underestimation by a factor of $\\alpha_{0}/\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 5/6$, or $\\approx 16.7\\%$, is correct.\n- The proposed cross-check using excited-state lines in bias spectroscopy to find $\\Delta$ is a standard, valid method that meets the criterion of being independent of $\\alpha$.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The true lever arm is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.08$ because the gate-voltage spacings exceed the bias extents. Using $\\alpha_{0}$ therefore overestimates both $E_{C}$ and $\\Delta$. A valid cross-check is a Hall effect measurement of carrier density to recalibrate $\\alpha$.**\n- The value $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.08$ is incorrect. The reasoning provided is nonsensical.\n- Because $\\alpha_0 = 0.10$ is less than $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.12$, the energies are underestimated, not overestimated.\n- A Hall effect measurement is not a bias spectroscopy technique and is an indirect method at best for this context.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The true lever arm is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = C_{g}/C_{d}$ read from the positive-slope diamond edge, giving $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.12$, and the correct energies are $E_{C} = 2.4\\ \\mathrm{meV}$ and $\\Delta = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{meV}$. A cross-check is to use the diagonally oriented lines in bias spectroscopy to compute $\\alpha$ directly from their slope.**\n- The equation $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{true}} = C_{g}/C_{d}$ is incorrect. The definition is $\\alpha = C_{g}/C_{\\Sigma}$.\n- The slope of the positive-slope diamond edge is $C_{g}/C_{s}$, not $\\alpha$. Thus, the physical reasoning is incorrect.\n- While the numerical values for the lever arm and energies are coincidentally correct, the underlying physics presented to obtain them is false.\n- The cross-check is a valid method, but it is a distinct method to find $\\alpha$ using slopes, not an $\\alpha$-independent cross-check for $\\Delta$ as described in option C's superior explanation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
