            "problem": "A lateral nonlocal spin valve (NSV) is built on a homogeneous two-dimensional conducting channel at low temperature, with two ferromagnetic (F) electrodes acting as injector and detector. The channel is free of drift fields in the detection region and has uniform spin relaxation, so that spin transport between injector and detector can be treated as quasi-one-dimensional along the axis connecting the electrodes.

The use of the spin diffusion equation is the standard theoretical framework for this phenomenon.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is structured to find a specific physical parameter, $\\lambda_s$. It provides data from two distinct experimental conditions (different distances $L_1$ and $L_2$), which is sufficient to solve for the unknowns in the governing exponential decay model.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased scientific terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem that can be solved using the provided information and fundamental principles of physics. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe transport of spin accumulation in the channel, represented by the spin chemical potential $\\mu_s(x)$, is described by the one-dimensional steady-state spin diffusion equation in the absence of drift:\n$$\nD_s \\frac{d^2 \\mu_s(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\mu_s(x)}{\\tau_s} = 0\n$$\nHere, $D_s$ is the spin diffusion coefficient and $\\tau_s$ is the spin relaxation time. The spin diffusion length is defined as $\\lambda_s = \\sqrt{D_s \\tau_s}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\lambda_s^2 \\frac{d^2 \\mu_s(x)}{dx^2} - \\mu_s(x) = 0\n$$\nLet the injector be at position $x=0$. The general solution to this ordinary differential equation is $\\mu_s(x) = C_1 \\exp(x/\\lambda_s) + C_2 \\exp(-x/\\lambda_s)$. For a channel that is long compared to $\\lambda_s$, the spin accumulation must vanish far from the injector, i.e., $\\mu_s(x) \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. This boundary condition implies that for $x > 0$, the solution must take the form of a decaying exponential:\n$$\n\\mu_s(x) = \\mu_s(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_s}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_s(0)$ is the spin accumulation generated at the injector.\n\nThe problem states that the detected nonlocal voltage is proportional to the local spin accumulation. The total measured voltage includes a spin-independent background $V_{\\text{BG}}$ and a spin-dependent signal $\\pm V_{\\text{spin}}$. The sign of the spin-dependent term depends on the relative alignment of the injector and detector magnetizations.\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{P}} = V_{\\text{BG}} - V_{\\text{spin}}\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{AP}} = V_{\\text{BG}} + V_{\\text{spin}}\n$$\nThis convention is chosen based on the data, where $V_{\\mathrm{AP}} > V_{\\mathrm{P}}$. The nonlocal spin signal, $\\Delta V$, is defined to isolate the spin-dependent part by subtracting the two measurements:\n$$\n\\Delta V = V_{\\mathrm{AP}} - V_{\\mathrm{P}} = (V_{\\text{BG}} + V_{\\text{spin}}) - (V_{\\text{BG}} - V_{\\text{spin}}) = 2V_{\\text{spin}}\n$$\nThe spin-dependent voltage $V_{\\text{spin}}$ is directly proportional to the spin accumulation $\\mu_s$ at the detector. The spin accumulation is in turn generated by the injection current $I$. Therefore, $V_{\\text{spin}}$ is proportional to both $I$ and the spatial decay factor.\nThe nonlocal spin resistance, $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL}} = \\Delta V/I = 2V_{\\text{spin}}/I$, is thus proportional to the exponential decay term. We can write its dependence on the injector-detector separation $L$ as:\n$$\n\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL}}(L) = R_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda_s}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $R_0$ is a prefactor that depends on the geometry and material properties (such as electrode polarizations and channel conductivity), but is assumed to be the same for both nominally identical devices. This derivation fulfills the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we use the experimental data to find $\\lambda_s$. First, we calculate $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL}}$ for each device using the current $I = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{A}$.\n\nFor Device A ($L_1 = 0.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$):\n$$\n\\Delta V_1 = V_{\\mathrm{AP},1} - V_{\\mathrm{P},1} = 0.70\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V} - 0.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V} = 0.60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL},1} = \\frac{\\Delta V_1}{I} = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{V}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{A}} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega\n$$\nFor Device B ($L_2 = 2.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$):\n$$\n\\Delta V_2 = V_{\\mathrm{AP},2} - V_{\\mathrm{P},2} = 0.20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V} - 0.02\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V} = 0.18\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL},2} = \\frac{\\Delta V_2}{I} = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{V}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{A}} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega\n$$\nWe have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $R_0$ and $\\lambda_s$:\n$$\n\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL},1} = R_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L_1}{\\lambda_s}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL},2} = R_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L_2}{\\lambda_s}\\right)\n$$\nDividing the first equation by the second eliminates the prefactor $R_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL},1}}{\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL},2}} = \\frac{\\exp(-L_1/\\lambda_s)}{\\exp(-L_2/\\lambda_s)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{L_2 - L_1}{\\lambda_s}\\right)\n$$\nWe solve for $\\lambda_s$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL},1}}{\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL},2}}\\right) = \\frac{L_2 - L_1}{\\lambda_s}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_s = \\frac{L_2 - L_1}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL},1}}{\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL},2}}\\right)}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n\\lambda_s = \\frac{2.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} - 0.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega}{1.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega}\\right)} = \\frac{1.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)}\n$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\n\\lambda_s \\approx \\frac{1.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{1.2039728} \\approx 1.24587\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in nanometers, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\lambda_s \\approx 1245.87\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\lambda_s = 1246\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of spin transport physics, mathematically well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe central task is to determine the one-dimensional Spin Diffusion Length (SDL), denoted as $ \\ell(\\mathbf{u}) $, along a specified direction vector $ \\mathbf{u} $. This requires reducing the given three-dimensional steady-state spin diffusion equation to a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE).\n\nThe governing equation for the spin accumulation $ \\mu_s(\\mathbf{r}) $ is given as:\n$$\n- \\nabla \\cdot \\left( D \\nabla \\mu_s \\right) + \\frac{\\mu_s}{\\tau_s} = 0\n$$\nwhere $ D $ is the constant, symmetric positive definite (SPD) spin diffusion tensor, and $ \\tau_s $ is the scalar spin relaxation time.\n\nWe seek a solution that varies only along the direction of a given nonzero vector $ \\mathbf{u} $. First, we normalize $ \\mathbf{u} $ to obtain a unit vector $ \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} = \\mathbf{u} / \\|\\mathbf{u}\\| $. We then postulate a one-dimensional solution form for $ \\mu_s $ that depends only on the arc-length parameter $ s = \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} $ along this direction. Let this solution be $ \\mu_s(\\mathbf{r}) = f(s) $.\n\nThe gradient of $ \\mu_s $ is found using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\nabla \\mu_s = \\nabla f(s) = \\frac{df}{ds} \\nabla s\n$$\nThe gradient of the scalar field $ s = \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} $ is simply the constant unit vector $ \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} $. Thus, the gradient of the spin accumulation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\mu_s = \\frac{df}{ds} \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}\n$$\nNext, we consider the spin current density term, $ \\mathbf{j}_s = -D \\nabla \\mu_s $. Substituting our expression for the gradient gives:\n$$\nD \\nabla \\mu_s = D \\left( \\frac{df}{ds} \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} \\right) = \\frac{df}{ds} (D \\hat{\\mathbf{u}})\n$$\nSince both $ D $ and $ \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} $ are constant, the vector $ D \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} $ is also constant.\n\nThe first term in the governing equation is the divergence of $ -D \\nabla \\mu_s $. Let's compute this divergence:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla \\mu_s) = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{df}{ds} (D \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the vector calculus identity $ \\nabla \\cdot (\\phi \\mathbf{A}) = (\\nabla \\phi) \\cdot \\mathbf{A} + \\phi (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) $, with the scalar field $ \\phi = \\frac{df}{ds} $ and the constant vector field $ \\mathbf{A} = D \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} $, we note that $ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = 0 $. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla \\mu_s) = \\left( \\nabla \\frac{df}{ds} \\right) \\cdot (D \\hat{\\mathbf{u}})\n$$\nThe gradient of $ \\frac{df}{ds} $ is found similarly to the gradient of $ f(s) $:\n$$\n\\nabla \\frac{df}{ds} = \\frac{d}{ds}\\left(\\frac{df}{ds}\\right) \\nabla s = \\frac{d^2f}{ds^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we obtain:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla \\mu_s) = \\left( \\frac{d^2f}{ds^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} \\right) \\cdot (D \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) = \\frac{d^2f}{ds^2} (\\hat{\\mathbf{u}} \\cdot (D \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}))\n$$\nThe term $ \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} \\cdot (D \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) $, which can be written in matrix notation as the quadratic form $ \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}^T D \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} $, is a scalar representing the effective diffusion coefficient along the direction $ \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} $. Let's define it as $ D_{\\text{eff}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) = \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}^T D \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} $. Since $ D $ is SPD, $ D_{\\text{eff}} $ is guaranteed to be positive for any non-zero $ \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} $.\n\nThe original partial differential equation now reduces to a one-dimensional, second-order, linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation for $ f(s) $:\n$$\n- D_{\\text{eff}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) \\frac{d^2f}{ds^2} + \\frac{f(s)}{\\tau_s} = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation into standard form gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f}{ds^2} - \\frac{1}{D_{\\text{eff}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) \\tau_s} f(s) = 0\n$$\nThis equation has solutions of the form $ f(s) = C_1 e^{k s} + C_2 e^{-k s} $, where $ k^2 = 1 / (D_{\\text{eff}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) \\tau_s) $. The physically meaningful solutions are those that decay, corresponding to the term $ e^{-s/\\ell} $. By comparing this with our solution form, we identify the Spin Diffusion Length $ \\ell(\\mathbf{u}) $ as the characteristic decay length $ 1/k $:\n$$\n\\ell(\\mathbf{u})^2 = D_{\\text{eff}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) \\tau_s = (\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}^T D \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) \\tau_s\n$$\nTherefore, the Spin Diffusion Length is given by the positive square root:\n$$\n\\ell(\\mathbf{u}) = \\sqrt{(\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}^T D \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) \\tau_s}\n$$\nThis formula provides a direct method for calculating the SDL for each test case. The procedure is as follows:\n$1$. For a given direction vector $ \\mathbf{u} $, compute its normalized form $ \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} = \\mathbf{u} / \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_2 $.\n$2$. For the given diffusion tensor $ D $, compute the effective diffusion coefficient $ D_{\\text{eff}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}^T D \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} $.\n$3$. Using the given spin relaxation time $ \\tau_s $, calculate the SDL as $ \\ell = \\sqrt{D_{\\text{eff}} \\tau_s} $.\n$4$. The final result is rounded to six significant figures.",
