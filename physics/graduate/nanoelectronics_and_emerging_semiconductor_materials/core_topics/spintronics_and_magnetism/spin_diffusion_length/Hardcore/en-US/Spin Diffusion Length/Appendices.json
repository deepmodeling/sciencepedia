            "problem": "A lateral nonlocal spin valve (NSV) is built on a homogeneous two-dimensional conducting channel at low temperature, with two ferromagnetic (F) electrodes acting as injector and detector. The channel is free of drift fields in the detection region and has uniform spin relaxation, so that spin transport between injector and detector can be treated as quasi-one-dimensional along the axis connecting the electrodes.

The use of the spin diffusion equation is the standard theoretical framework for this phenomenon.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is structured to find a specific physical parameter, $\\lambda_s$. It provides data from two distinct experimental conditions (different distances $L_1$ and $L_2$), which is sufficient to solve for the unknowns in the governing exponential decay model.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased scientific terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem that can be solved using the provided information and fundamental principles of physics. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe transport of spin accumulation in the channel, represented by the spin chemical potential $\\mu_s(x)$, is described by the one-dimensional steady-state spin diffusion equation in the absence of drift:\n$$\nD_s \\frac{d^2 \\mu_s(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\mu_s(x)}{\\tau_s} = 0\n$$\nHere, $D_s$ is the spin diffusion coefficient and $\\tau_s$ is the spin relaxation time. The spin diffusion length is defined as $\\lambda_s = \\sqrt{D_s \\tau_s}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\lambda_s^2 \\frac{d^2 \\mu_s(x)}{dx^2} - \\mu_s(x) = 0\n$$\nLet the injector be at position $x=0$. The general solution to this ordinary differential equation is $\\mu_s(x) = C_1 \\exp(x/\\lambda_s) + C_2 \\exp(-x/\\lambda_s)$. For a channel that is long compared to $\\lambda_s$, the spin accumulation must vanish far from the injector, i.e., $\\mu_s(x) \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. This boundary condition implies that for $x > 0$, the solution must take the form of a decaying exponential:\n$$\n\\mu_s(x) = \\mu_s(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_s}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_s(0)$ is the spin accumulation generated at the injector.\n\nThe problem states that the detected nonlocal voltage is proportional to the local spin accumulation. The total measured voltage includes a spin-independent background $V_{\\text{BG}}$ and a spin-dependent signal $\\pm V_{\\text{spin}}$. The sign of the spin-dependent term depends on the relative alignment of the injector and detector magnetizations.\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{P}} = V_{\\text{BG}} - V_{\\text{spin}}\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{AP}} = V_{\\text{BG}} + V_{\\text{spin}}\n$$\nThis convention is chosen based on the data, where $V_{\\mathrm{AP}} > V_{\\mathrm{P}}$. The nonlocal spin signal, $\\Delta V$, is defined to isolate the spin-dependent part by subtracting the two measurements:\n$$\n\\Delta V = V_{\\mathrm{AP}} - V_{\\mathrm{P}} = (V_{\\text{BG}} + V_{\\text{spin}}) - (V_{\\text{BG}} - V_{\\text{spin}}) = 2V_{\\text{spin}}\n$$\nThe spin-dependent voltage $V_{\\text{spin}}$ is directly proportional to the spin accumulation $\\mu_s$ at the detector. The spin accumulation is in turn generated by the injection current $I$. Therefore, $V_{\\text{spin}}$ is proportional to both $I$ and the spatial decay factor.\nThe nonlocal spin resistance, $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL}} = \\Delta V/I = 2V_{\\text{spin}}/I$, is thus proportional to the exponential decay term. We can write its dependence on the injector-detector separation $L$ as:\n$$\n\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{NL}}(L) = R_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda_s}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $R_0$ is a prefactor that depends on the geometry and material properties (such as electrode polarizations and channel conductivity), but is assumed to be the same for both nominally identical devices. This derivation fulfills the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we use the experimental data to find $\\lambda_s$.

The physical setup exhibits symmetry with respect to the center of the film at $y=0$. The Spin Hall Effect generates a spin current that flows from the center towards the surfaces, resulting in a spin accumulation of opposite sign at the two surfaces. This implies that the spin accumulation profile $\\mu_{s}(y)$ must be an odd function of $y$, i.e., $\\mu_s(-y) = -\\mu_s(y)$.

The spin diffusion equation, the linear response relation for spin current, and the boundary conditions for a spin sink and interfacial spin memory loss are all standard concepts. The given parameters are physically realistic for semiconductor materials. The problem is well-posed, providing a second-order ordinary differential equation with two boundary conditions, ensuring a unique solution exists. The problem is stated objectively and is free of ambiguities or contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady-state one-dimensional spin diffusion equation for the spin voltage $\\mu_s(x)$ in the nonmagnetic layer ($0 \\le x \\le d$):\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\mu_{s}(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{N}^2} \\mu_{s}(x) = 0 $$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The general solution is a linear combination of exponential or hyperbolic functions. The hyperbolic form is particularly convenient when boundary conditions are applied at the edges of the domain. By shifting the origin of the hyperbolic functions to $x=d$, the solution can be written as:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(x) = A \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x-d}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right) + B \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x-d}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right) $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nFirst, we apply the boundary condition at $x=d$, where the perfect spin sink ensures $\\mu_s(d) = 0$:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(d) = A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) = A \\cdot 1 + B \\cdot 0 = A $$\nThus, we find that $A=0$. The solution simplifies to:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(x) = B \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x-d}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right) $$\nNext, we apply the boundary condition at $x=0$, which accounts for the Spin Memory Loss at the interface:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(0) = (1-p)\\,\\mu_{s}^{F}(0^{-}) $$\nLet's define the spin voltage at the nonmagnet side of the interface as $\\mu_{s0} \\equiv \\mu_{s}(0)$. Substituting $x=0$ into our solution for $\\mu_{s}(x)$:\n$$ \\mu_{s0} = B \\sinh\\left(\\frac{-d}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right) = -B \\sinh\\left(\\frac{d}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right) $$\nSolving for the constant $B$:\n$$ B = -\\frac{\\mu_{s0}}{\\sinh(d/\\lambda_{N})} = -\\frac{(1-p)\\,\\mu_{s}^{F}(0^{-})}{\\sinh(d/\\lambda_{N})} $$\nSubstituting $B$ back into the expression for $\\mu_{s}(x)$, we obtain the specific solution for the spin voltage profile within the layer:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(x) = -\\frac{(1-p)\\,\\mu_{s}^{F}(0^{-})}{\\sinh(d/\\lambda_{N})} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x-d}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right) $$\nThe problem asks for the spin current density, $j_{s}(x)$, which is related to the spin voltage gradient by $j_{s}(x) = -\\sigma_{N}\\,\\frac{d \\mu_{s}}{dx}$. We must first compute the derivative of $\\mu_{s}(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu_{s}}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ -\\frac{(1-p)\\,\\mu_{s}^{F}(0^{-})}{\\sinh(d/\\lambda_{N})} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x-d}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right) \\right] $$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{d}{du}(\\sinh(u)) = \\cosh(u)$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu_{s}}{dx} = -\\frac{(1-p)\\,\\mu_{s}^{F}(0^{-})}{\\sinh(d/\\lambda_{N})} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x-d}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{N}} $$\nNow, we find the expression for the spin current density $j_{s}(x)$:\n$$ j_{s}(x) = -\\sigma_{N} \\left( -\\frac{(1-p)\\,\\mu_{s}^{F}(0^{-})}{\\lambda_{N}\\sinh(d/\\lambda_{N})} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x-d}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right) \\right) $$\n$$ j_{s}(x) = \\frac{\\sigma_{N} (1-p) \\mu_{s}^{F}(0^{-})}{\\lambda_{N} \\sinh(d/\\lambda_{N})} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x-d}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right) $$\nThis is the general expression for the spin current density at any position $x$ within the nonmagnetic layer.\n\nThe problem requires the numerical value of the spin current density at the film midpoint, $x=d/2$. We substitute this value into our expression for $j_s(x)$:\n$$ j_{s}(d/2) = \\frac{\\sigma_{N} (1-p) \\mu_{s}^{F}(0^{-})}{\\lambda_{N} \\sinh(d/\\lambda_{N})} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{d/2-d}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right) $$\n$$ j_{s}(d/2) = \\frac{\\sigma_{N} (1-p) \\mu_{s}^{F}(0^{-})}{\\lambda_{N} \\sinh(d/\\lambda_{N})} \\cosh\\left(-\\frac{d}{2\\lambda_{N}}\\right) $$\nSince $\\cosh(-z) = \\cosh(z)$, the expression becomes:\n$$ j_{s}(d/2) = \\frac{\\sigma_{N} (1-p) \\mu_{s}^{F}(0^{-})}{\\lambda_{N}} \\frac{\\cosh(d/(2\\lambda_{N}))}{\\sinh(d/\\lambda_{N})} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.
