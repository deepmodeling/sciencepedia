            "problem": "A nonmagnetic semiconductor nanochannel of length $L$ supports steady-state spin transport at temperature $T$ under zero applied electric field. Spin is injected at $x=0$ from a ferromagnetic tunnel contact such that the spin electrochemical potential difference (spin accumulation) is fixed to $\\mu_{s}(0)=\\mu_{0}$. At the opposite end, $x=L$, the channel terminates in a specular boundary that does not absorb spin, resulting in zero spin current there.\n\nStarting from the spin-density continuity equation with relaxation, the linear irreversible thermodynamics relation between spin current and spin-density gradient, and the local thermodynamic relation connecting spin density to spin electrochemical potential, derive the steady-state one-dimensional differential equation governing $\\mu_{s}(x)$ in the homogeneous channel.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and solution of the one-dimensional steady-state spin diffusion equation for the spin electrochemical potential, $\\mu_{s}(x)$, in a nonmagnetic semiconductor channel of length $L$. We begin by formalizing the physical principles provided.\n\nThe first principle is the steady-state spin-density continuity equation in one dimension with a spin relaxation term. In the absence of an electric field (no drift), this equation relates the spatial derivative of the spin current density, $J_{s}(x)$, to the spin density, $n_{s}(x)$, and the spin-relaxation time, $\\tau_{s}$:\n$$ \\frac{dJ_{s}}{dx} = -\\frac{n_{s}}{\\tau_{s}} $$\nHere, $n_{s}$ represents the excess population of one spin orientation over the other.\n\nThe second principle is the linear irreversible thermodynamics relation connecting the spin current to the gradient of the spin density. This is Fick's first law of diffusion applied to spin, where $D_{s}$ is the spin diffusion coefficient:\n$$ J_{s}(x) = -D_{s} \\frac{dn_{s}}{dx} $$\n\nThe third principle is the local thermodynamic relation between the spin density $n_{s}$ and the spin electrochemical potential $\\mu_{s}$. This relationship is one of proportionality for a homogeneous material, defined by the spin susceptibility $\\chi_{s}$:\n$$ n_{s}(x) = \\chi_{s} \\mu_{s}(x) $$\nSince the channel is homogeneous, $\\chi_{s}$ is a constant.\n\nTo derive the governing differential equation for $\\mu_{s}(x)$, we combine these three equations. We substitute the second equation into the first:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -D_{s} \\frac{dn_{s}}{dx} \\right) = -\\frac{n_{s}}{\\tau_{s}} $$\nAs the material parameters are homogeneous, the spin diffusion coefficient $D_{s}$ is constant. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ D_{s} \\frac{d^{2}n_{s}}{dx^{2}} = \\frac{n_{s}}{\\tau_{s}} $$\nRearranging gives:\n$$ \\frac{d^{2}n_{s}}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{1}{D_{s}\\tau_{s}} n_{s} = 0 $$\nThe problem defines the spin diffusion length as $\\lambda_{s} = \\sqrt{D_{s}\\tau_{s}}$. Substituting this definition, we obtain the differential equation for the spin density:\n$$ \\frac{d^{2}n_{s}}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{s}^{2}} n_{s} = 0 $$\nNow, we express this equation in terms of the spin electrochemical potential $\\mu_{s}(x)$ using the relation $n_{s}(x) = \\chi_{s} \\mu_{s}(x)$. Since $\\chi_{s}$ is constant, its derivatives are zero, and we have $\\frac{d^{2}n_{s}}{dx^{2}} = \\chi_{s} \\frac{d^{2}\\mu_{s}}{dx^{2}}$. Substituting this into the equation yields:\n$$ \\chi_{s} \\frac{d^{2}\\mu_{s}}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{s}^{2}} \\chi_{s} \\mu_{s} = 0 $$\nAssuming a non-zero spin susceptibility ($\\chi_{s} \\neq 0$), we can divide by $\\chi_{s}$ to obtain the final steady-state one-dimensional differential equation for $\\mu_{s}(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^{2}\\mu_{s}}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{s}^{2}} \\mu_{s} = 0 $$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The general solution can be written in terms of hyperbolic functions, which is convenient for boundary value problems on a finite domain:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(x) = C_{1} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) + C_{2} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) $$\nwhere $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are constants to be determined from the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  At the injection contact, $x=0$, the spin accumulation is fixed: $\\mu_{s}(0) = \\mu_{0}$.\n2.  At the specular boundary, $x=L$, the spin current is zero: $J_{s}(L) = 0$.\n\nTo apply the second boundary condition, we express the spin current $J_{s}$ in terms of $\\mu_{s}$. Using $J_{s} = -D_{s} \\frac{dn_{s}}{dx}$ and $n_{s} = \\chi_{s} \\mu_{s}$, we get:\n$$ J_{s}(x) = -D_{s} \\frac{d}{dx}(\\chi_{s}\\mu_{s}(x)) = -D_{s}\\chi_{s} \\frac{d\\mu_{s}}{dx} $$\nThe condition $J_{s}(L)=0$ thus implies that the derivative of the spin electrochemical potential must be zero at $x=L$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu_{s}}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = 0 $$\n\nNow we apply these two conditions to the general solution.\nApplying the first boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(0) = C_{1} \\cosh(0) + C_{2} \\sinh(0) = C_{1}(1) + C_{2}(0) = C_{1} $$\nThus, we find $C_{1} = \\mu_{0}$. The solution becomes:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(x) = \\mu_{0} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) + C_{2} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) $$\n\nNext, we apply the second boundary condition at $x=L$. First, we compute the derivative of $\\mu_{s}(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu_{s}}{dx} = \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{\\lambda_{s}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) + \\frac{C_{2}}{\\lambda_{s}} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) $$\nSetting the derivative to zero at $x=L$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu_{s}}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{\\lambda_{s}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) + \\frac{C_{2}}{\\lambda_{s}} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) = 0 $$\nSolving for $C_{2}$:\n$$ C_{2} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) = -\\mu_{0} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) $$\n$$ C_{2} = -\\mu_{0} \\frac{\\sinh(L/\\lambda_{s})}{\\cosh(L/\\lambda_{s})} = -\\mu_{0} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ back into the solution for $\\mu_{s}(x)$:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(x) = \\mu_{0} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) - \\mu_{0} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) $$\nTo obtain a more compact and insightful form, we factor out $\\mu_{0}$ and express $\\tanh$ as a ratio of $\\sinh$ and $\\cosh$:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(x) = \\mu_{0} \\left[ \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) - \\frac{\\sinh(L/\\lambda_{s})}{\\cosh(L/\\lambda_{s})} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\mu_{s}(x) = \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{\\cosh(L/\\lambda_{s})} \\left[ \\cosh\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right)\\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) - \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right)\\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) \\right] $$\nUsing the hyperbolic identity $\\cosh(A-B) = \\cosh(A)\\cosh(B) - \\sinh(A)\\sinh(B)$ with $A = L/\\lambda_{s}$ and $B = x/\\lambda_{s}$, we arrive at the final closed-form solution:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(x) = \\mu_{0} \\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{L-x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right)} $$\n\nA brief physical interpretation of this solution's shape is as follows. The spin accumulation $\\mu_{s}(x)$ is highest at the injection point $x=0$, where it is fixed at $\\mu_{0}$. As one moves into the channel ($x>0$), spins undergo relaxation processes, causing the spin accumulation to decay. The characteristic length scale of this decay is the spin diffusion length, $\\lambda_{s}$. The function $\\cosh\\left(\\frac{L-x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right)$ dictates the spatial profile. Because of the zero spin-current boundary condition at $x=L$, which models a perfect spin reflector, spins cannot exit the channel at that end. This leads to a \"pile-up\" of spin accumulation, resulting in a non-zero value $\\mu_{s}(L) = \\mu_{0}/\\cosh(L/\\lambda_{s})$ and a zero-gradient profile ($\\frac{d\\mu_s}{dx}=0$) at $x=L$. The shape is thus an asymmetric decaying curve, starting at $\\mu_0$, decreasing with distance, but flattening out as it approaches the reflective boundary at $x=L$.",

            "solution": "### Derivation of the Governing Differential Equation\nThe derivation begins with the two fundamental equations provided: the steady-state continuity equation and the drift-diffusion relation for spin current.\n\n1.  The continuity equation is:\n    $$0 = -\\frac{\\partial j_{s}}{\\partial x} - \\frac{s}{\\tau_{s}}$$\n    In steady state, this can be rewritten as:\n    $$\\frac{d j_{s}}{d x} = -\\frac{s}{\\tau_{s}}$$\n\n2.  The drift-diffusion equation for the spin current $j_s$ is:\n    $$j_{s}(x) = -D \\frac{d s}{d x} + v_{d} s(x)$$\n\n3.  We substitute the expression for $j_s(x)$ into the continuity equation:\n    $$\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -D \\frac{d s}{d x} + v_{d} s \\right) = -\\frac{s}{\\tau_{s}}$$\n\n4.  Since $D$ and $v_d = \\mu E$ are spatially uniform, we can expand the derivative:\n    $$-D \\frac{d^2 s}{d x^2} + v_{d} \\frac{d s}{d x} = -\\frac{s}{\\tau_{s}}$$\n\n5.  Now, we use the relation between spin density $s(x)$ and spin accumulation chemical potential $\\mu_s(x)$, which is $s(x) = \\chi \\mu_s(x)$. Since the spin susceptibility $\\chi$ is also uniform, we can substitute this into the equation. The constant $\\chi$ appears in every term and can be cancelled out:\n    $$-D \\chi \\frac{d^2 \\mu_s}{d x^2} + v_{d} \\chi \\frac{d \\mu_s}{d x} = -\\frac{\\chi \\mu_s}{\\tau_{s}}$$\n    $$\\implies -D \\frac{d^2 \\mu_s}{d x^2} + v_{d} \\frac{d \\mu_s}{d x} = -\\frac{\\mu_s}{\\tau_{s}}$$\n\n6.  Rearranging the terms to the standard form of a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n    $$D \\frac{d^2 \\mu_s}{d x^2} - v_{d} \\frac{d \\mu_s}{d x} - \\frac{1}{\\tau_{s}} \\mu_s = 0$$\n    This is the governing ODE for $\\mu_s(x)$.\n\n### Solving for Characteristic Inverse Decay Lengths\nTo find the spatial modes, we assume a solution of the form $\\mu_s(x) \\propto \\exp(k x)$. Substituting this into the ODE yields the characteristic equation for the wavevector $k$:\n$$D k^2 - v_{d} k - \\frac{1}{\\tau_{s}} = 0$$\nDividing by $D$, we get:\n$$k^2 - \\frac{v_d}{D} k - \\frac{1}{D \\tau_s} = 0$$\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{\\frac{v_d}{D} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{v_d}{D}\\right)^2 - 4(1)\\left(-\\frac{1}{D \\tau_s}\\right)}}{2} = \\frac{v_d}{2D} \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{v_d^2}{D^2} + \\frac{4}{D \\tau_s}}$$\n$$k = \\frac{v_d}{2D} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{v_d^2}{4D^2} + \\frac{1}{D \\tau_s}}$$\nThe two roots, $k_1$ and $k_2$, correspond to the two exponential modes. Let's identify the positive and negative roots. The term under the square root is strictly positive and its root is greater than $|\\frac{v_d}{2D}|$.\n$$k_1 = \\frac{v_d}{2D} + \\sqrt{\\frac{v_d^2}{4D^2} + \\frac{1}{D \\tau_s}} > 0$$\n$$k_2 = \\frac{v_d}{2D} - \\sqrt{\\frac{v_d^2}{4D^2} + \\frac{1}{D \\tau_s}} < 0$$\nThe general solution is $\\mu_s(x) = C_1 \\exp(k_1 x) + C_2 \\exp(k_2 x)$.\n\nThe problem defines inverse decay lengths for upstream and downstream regions:\n-   For the upstream region ($x<0$), the solution must decay as $x \\to -\\infty$. This requires a positive exponent, so we must use the mode $\\exp(k_1 x)$. The problem associates this with the decay length $\\lambda_-$, so the functional form is $\\exp(x/\\lambda_-)$. Thus, we identify $k_1 = 1/\\lambda_-$.\n-   For the downstream region ($x>0$), the solution must decay as $x \\to +\\infty$. This requires a negative exponent, so we must use the mode $\\exp(k_2 x)$. The problem associates this with the decay length $\\lambda_+$, so the functional form is $\\exp(-x/\\lambda_+)$. Thus, we identify $k_2 = -1/\\lambda_+$.\n\nUsing these identifications, we find the expressions for the inverse decay lengths:\n$$1/\\lambda_{-} = k_1 = \\frac{v_d}{2D} + \\sqrt{\\frac{v_d^2}{4D^2} + \\frac{1}{D \\tau_s}}$$\n$$1/\\lambda_{+} = -k_2 = -\\left(\\frac{v_d}{2D} - \\sqrt{\\frac{v_d^2}{4D^2} + \\frac{1}{D \\tau_s}}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{v_d^2}{4D^2} + \\frac{1}{D \\tau_s}} - \\frac{v_d}{2D}$$\nFinally, we substitute $v_d = \\mu E$ and use the definition of the zero-field spin diffusion length, $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D \\tau_s}$, which implies $1/\\lambda^2 = 1/(D \\tau_s)$.\n$$1/\\lambda_{-} = \\frac{\\mu E}{2D} + \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\mu E)^2}{4D^2} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}}$$\n$$1/\\lambda_{+} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\mu E)^2}{4D^2} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}} - \\frac{\\mu E}{2D}$$\n\n### Qualitative Explanation\nThe presence of the electric field $E$ breaks the spatial symmetry of the spin accumulation profile $\\mu_s(x)$ around the injector at $x=0$.\n\nIn the zero-field case ($E=0$), we have $v_d=0$. The expressions for the inverse decay lengths simplify to:\n$$1/\\lambda_{-} = 1/\\lambda_{+} = \\sqrt{1/\\lambda^2} = 1/\\lambda$$\nThe decay length is $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D \\tau_s}$ in both the upstream and downstream directions. The spin transport is purely diffusive, resulting in a symmetric exponential decay of spin accumulation away from the injector, i.e., $\\mu_s(x) = \\mu_s(-x)$.\n\nIn the non-zero field case ($E \\neq 0$), a drift component is added to the spin transport. The direction of this drift is given by the sign of $v_d = \\mu E$. For electrons, the mobility constant $\\mu$ is conventionally taken as negative (or the relation is $v_d = - \\mu_e E$ with $\\mu_e > 0$). With $E$ applied in the $+x$ direction ($E>0$), the resulting drift velocity $v_d$ is in the $-x$ direction (upstream).\nThis electron drift \"sweeps\" the spin polarization against the direction of the electric field.\n-   **Downstream ($x>0$):** The drift opposes the diffusion of spins away from the injector into the downstream region. This enhances the decay process. The effective decay length $\\lambda_+$ becomes shorter than the zero-field diffusion length $\\lambda$. Mathematically, with $v_d<0$, the term $-v_d/(2D)$ is positive, so $1/\\lambda_{+} = \\sqrt{(\\dots)} - v_d/(2D) > 1/\\lambda$, which means $\\lambda_+ < \\lambda$.\n-   **Upstream ($x<0$):** The drift assists the transport of spins into the upstream region. This counteracts the spin relaxation, allowing spins to penetrate further. The effective decay length $\\lambda_-$ becomes longer than $\\lambda$. Mathematically, with $v_d<0$, the term $v_d/(2D)$ is negative, so $1/\\lambda_{-} = \\sqrt{(\\dots)} + v_d/(2D) < 1/\\lambda$, which means $\\lambda_- > \\lambda$.\n\nIn summary, the applied field breaks the symmetry by creating a net drift. For electrons, the spin accumulation profile becomes asymmetric, decaying more rapidly in the direction of the electric field (downstream) and more slowly in the direction opposite to the electric field (upstream). The profile is effectively tilted in the direction of the electron drift.",

Substituting this back into the expression for $j_{s}^{q}(x)$:\n$$\nj_{s}^{q}(x) = \\frac{P I_{\\mathrm{in}}}{A_{N}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression gives the spin current density at any point $x$ in the channel.\n\nNext, we find the spin current density arriving at the spin-orbit bar, located at $x=L$:\n$$\nj_{s}^{q}(L) = \\frac{P I_{\\mathrm{in}}}{A_{N}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right)\n$$\nThis spin current is injected into the spin-orbit bar at $z=0$ (the interface) and decays along the $z$-direction as $j_{s}^{q}(z)=j_{s}^{q}(L)\\exp(-z/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}})$.\n\nThis spin current generates a transverse charge current density $J_{c}(z)$ via the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE), given by $J_{c}(z)=\\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}}\\,j_{s}^{q}(z)$.\n$$\nJ_{c}(z) = \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j_{s}^{q}(L) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}\\right)\n$$\nUnder open-circuit conditions, this ISHE current is perfectly balanced by a drift current $J_{drift} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SHE}} E_{y}$ flowing in the opposite direction, driven by the buildup of a uniform transverse electric field $E_{y}$. The total current through any cross-section of the bar along the $y$-direction is zero. Integrating the current densities over the thickness of the bar $t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}$ yields the total current per unit length, which must be zero. The problem provides the integrated constraint:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}} J_{c}(z)\\,dz + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SHE}}\\,E_{y}\\,t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}=0\n$$\nWe evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}} J_{c}(z)\\,dz = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}} \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j_{s}^{q}(L) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}\\right) dz = \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j_{s}^{q}(L) \\left[-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}\n$$\n$$\n= \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j_{s}^{q}(L) \\left(-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}\\right) - (-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}})\\exp(0)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j_{s}^{q}(L) \\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the open-circuit condition:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j_{s}^{q}(L) \\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\fract_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}\\right)\\right) + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SHE}}\\,E_{y}\\,t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}=0\n$$\nWe can now solve for the electric field $E_{y}$:\n$$\nE_{y} = -\\frac{\\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j_{s}^{q}(L) \\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SHE}} t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe measured ISHE voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{ISHE}}$, is the potential difference across the width of the detector, $L_{y}$. Given a uniform field $E_{y}$, the magnitude of the voltage is $V_{\\mathrm{ISHE}} = |E_{y}|L_{y}$. Taking the magnitude of the expression for $E_{y}$ and assuming $\\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}}$ is positive:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{ISHE}} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} |j_{s}^{q}(L)| \\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}} L_{y}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SHE}} t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nNow, we can solve for the spin Hall angle, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ISHE}} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SHE}} t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{|j_{s}^{q}(L)| \\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}} L_{y} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $j_{s}^{q}(L) = (P I_{\\mathrm{in}}/A_{N})\\exp(-L/\\lambda_{N})$ and note that all quantities in it are positive, so $|j_{s}^{q}(L)| = j_{s}^{q}(L)$.\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ISHE}} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SHE}} t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{\\left(\\frac{P I_{\\mathrm{in}}}{A_{N}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right)\\right) \\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}} L_{y} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\nRearranging the terms and substituting $A_{N}=w_{N}t_{N}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SHE}}=1/\\rho_{\\mathrm{SHE}}$, we obtain the final analytical expression for $\\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ISHE}} (w_{N}t_{N}) t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{P I_{\\mathrm{in}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{SHE}} \\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}} L_{y}} \\frac{\\exp(L/\\lambda_{N})}{1 - \\exp(-t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}})}\n$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $V_{\\mathrm{ISHE}}=1.80\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $w_{N}=5.00\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $t_{N}=5.00\\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}=7.00\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $P=0.40$\n- $I_{\\mathrm{in}}=2.00\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{A}$\n- $\\rho_{\\mathrm{SHE}}=1.00\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\Omega\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}=1.50\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $L_{y}=1.00\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $L=3.00\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\lambda_{N}=1.00\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the arguments of the exponential functions:\n$$\n\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{N}} = \\frac{3.00\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{1.00\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 3.00\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}} = \\frac{7.00\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{1.50\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 4.6667\n$$\nNext, we calculate the different parts of the expression:\nThe area of the channel is $A_{N} = w_{N}t_{N} = (5.00\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m})(5.00\\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 2.50\\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nThe prefactor is:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ISHE}} A_{N} t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{P I_{\\mathrm{in}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{SHE}} \\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}} L_{y}} = \\frac{(1.80\\times 10^{-5})(2.50\\times 10^{-14})(7.00\\times 10^{-9})}{(0.40)(2.00\\times 10^{-4})(1.00\\times 10^{-6})(1.50\\times 10^{-9})(1.00\\times 10^{-5})}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{3.15 \\times 10^{-27}}{1.20 \\times 10^{-24}} = 2.625 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nThe exponential terms are:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{N}}\\right) = \\exp(3.00) \\approx 20.0855\n$$\n$$\n1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SHE}}}\\right) = 1 - \\exp(-4.6667) \\approx 1 - 0.009405 = 0.990595\n$$\nCombining these parts:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} \\approx (2.625 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times \\frac{20.0855}{0.990595} \\approx (2.625 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 20.2762 \\approx 0.053234\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the effective spin Hall angle is $0.0532$.",
