            "problem": "A lateral double quantum dot (DQD) is defined by two plunger gates with voltages $V_{GL}$ and $V_{GR}$ that independently tune the left and right dot electrochemical potentials.

All concepts—lever arms, bias triangles, Pauli spin blockade, detuning—are fundamental to the field of nanoelectronics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and clear objectives. The numerical values are physically realistic for typical semiconductor systems (e.g., GaAs or Si-based quantum dots). The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent.\n\n**Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Bias-Triangle Leg Lengths**\n\nThe flow of current in the sequential tunneling regime is permitted only when the electrochemical potentials of the dots, $\\mu_L$ and $\\mu_R$, are situated within the transport window defined by the source and drain chemical potentials. This window is $[\\mu_D, \\mu_S]$. Given the problem's convention, this energy window is $[0, V_{SD}]$. The condition for current flow is thus:\n$$V_{SD} \\ge \\mu_L \\ge \\mu_R \\ge 0$$\nA bias triangle is the region in the gate-voltage space $(V_{GL}, V_{GR})$ where this set of inequalities holds. The \"legs\" of this triangle correspond to the maximum excursion in one gate voltage while the other is held constant, such that the system remains within the current-carrying region.\n\nLet's derive the length of the leg along the $V_{GL}$ axis, denoted $\\Delta V_{GL}$. This corresponds to a sweep of $V_{GL}$ while $V_{GR}$ is held constant. To achieve the maximum possible range for $\\mu_L$, we fix $V_{GR}$ such that $\\mu_R$ is pinned to one of the boundaries of its allowed range. Let's pin it to the lower boundary, $\\mu_R = 0$.\nWith $\\mu_R = 0$, the transport condition simplifies to:\n$$V_{SD} \\ge \\mu_L \\ge 0$$\nThis means that for a fixed $V_{GR}$ (where $\\mu_R = 0$), current can flow as long as the left dot's potential $\\mu_L$ is between $0$ and $V_{SD}$. The total range of $\\mu_L$ that supports transport is thus $\\Delta \\mu_{L, \\text{max}} = V_{SD} - 0 = V_{SD}$.\nThe relationship between a change in $\\mu_L$ and a change in $V_{GL}$ is given by $\\delta \\mu_L = -\\alpha_L \\delta V_{GL}$. The magnitude of the required gate voltage change, which we define as the leg length $\\Delta V_{GL}$, is:\n$$\\Delta V_{GL} = \\frac{|\\delta \\mu_L|}{\\alpha_L} = \\frac{V_{SD}}{\\alpha_L}$$\n\nSimilarly, for the leg along the $V_{GR}$ axis, denoted $\\Delta V_{GR}$, we sweep $V_{GR}$ while holding $V_{GL}$ constant. To achieve the maximum range for $\\mu_R$, we fix $V_{GL}$ such that $\\mu_L$ is pinned to its upper boundary, $\\mu_L = V_{SD}$.\nWith $\\mu_L = V_{SD}$, the transport condition becomes:\n$$V_{SD} \\ge \\mu_R \\ge 0$$\nThe total range of $\\mu_R$ that supports transport is $\\Delta \\mu_{R, \\text{max}} = V_{SD} - 0 = V_{SD}$.\nThe relationship between a change in $\\mu_R$ and a change in $V_{GR}$ is $\\delta \\mu_R = -\\alpha_R \\delta V_{GR}$. The magnitude of the required gate voltage change, the leg length $\\Delta V_{GR}$, is:\n$$\\Delta V_{GR} = \\frac{|\\delta \\mu_R|}{\\alpha_R} = \\frac{V_{SD}}{\\alpha_R}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values. The problem uses the convention that energies in eV are numerically equal to potentials in V. We will express $V_{SD}$ in V and $\\Delta_{ST}$ in eV to maintain consistency with the units of the lever arms.\n$V_{SD} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 0.0025\\,\\mathrm{V}$. This corresponds to an energy of $0.0025\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n$$\\Delta V_{GL} = \\frac{0.0025\\,\\mathrm{V}}{0.085} = 0.0294117... \\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 29.41\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n$$\\Delta V_{GR} = \\frac{0.0025\\,\\mathrm{V}}{0.065} = 0.0384615... \\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 38.46\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the PSB Span along the s-coordinate**\n\nPauli spin blockade (PSB) occurs when transport is inhibited due to spin conservation rules. In the $(1,1) \\to (0,2)$ transition, if the two electrons in the $(1,1)$ state form a spin triplet, $(1,1)T$, the transition to the lower-energy $(0,2)$ singlet ground state, $(0,2)S$, is forbidden. The transition to the excited $(0,2)$ triplet state, $(0,2)T$, is spin-allowed. Let the energy of the $(0,2)S$ state define a reference energy. The $(0,2)T$ state lies at energy $\\Delta_{ST}$ above it. The energy of the $(1,1)$ state relative to the $(0,2)S$ state is given by the detuning $\\varepsilon = \\mu_L - \\mu_R$ (ignoring tunnel coupling).\nThe spin-allowed transition $(1,1)T \\to (0,2)T$ is energetically possible only if the initial state energy is greater than or equal to the final state energy, i.e., $E(1,1) \\ge E(0,2)T$. In terms of detuning, this condition is:\n$$\\varepsilon \\ge \\Delta_{ST}$$\nWhen this condition is met, the blockade is lifted. Therefore, PSB holds when the transition is energetically forbidden, which is for:\n$$\\varepsilon < \\Delta_{ST}$$\nWithin the forward-bias triangle, sequential transport from left to right requires $\\mu_L \\ge \\mu_R$, which implies $\\varepsilon \\ge 0$. Combining these, the detuning range over which PSB is active is:\n$$0 \\le \\varepsilon < \\Delta_{ST}$$\nThe problem asks for the span of the parameter $s$ that corresponds to this range of $\\varepsilon$. The parameterization is given by $(\\delta V_{GL}, \\delta V_{GR}) = s(1/\\alpha_L, -1/\\alpha_R)$. Let's find the corresponding change in detuning, $\\delta \\varepsilon$.\n$$\\delta \\mu_L = -\\alpha_L \\delta V_{GL} = -\\alpha_L \\left(\\frac{s}{\\alpha_L}\\right) = -s$$\n$$\\delta \\mu_R = -\\alpha_R \\delta V_{GR} = -\\alpha_R \\left(-\\frac{s}{\\alpha_R}\\right) = s$$\nThe change in detuning is:\n$$\\delta \\varepsilon = \\delta \\mu_L - \\delta \\mu_R = -s - s = -2s$$\nLet's define our coordinate system such that $s=0$ corresponds to the onset of the transport window where $\\varepsilon=0$ (the hypotenuse of the bias triangle). Then $\\varepsilon(s) = -2s$.\nTo achieve a positive detuning $\\varepsilon > 0$, we must have $s < 0$. The condition for PSB, $0 \\le \\varepsilon < \\Delta_{ST}$, becomes:\n$$0 \\le -2s < \\Delta_{ST}$$\nDividing by $-2$ and reversing the inequalities gives:\n$$-\\frac{\\Delta_{ST}}{2} < s \\le 0$$\nThe \"span\" along the $s$-coordinate is the length of this interval, which is:\n$$\\Delta s = \\left|0 - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_{ST}}{2}\\right)\\right| = \\frac{\\Delta_{ST}}{2}$$\nThe units of $s$ can be inferred from its definition: $\\delta V_{GL} = s/\\alpha_L \\implies [s] = [\\delta V_{GL}] \\cdot [\\alpha_L] = \\mathrm{V} \\cdot (\\mathrm{eV/V}) = \\mathrm{eV}$. So $s$ is an energy.\nWe are given $\\Delta_{ST} = 0.72\\,\\mathrm{meV} = 0.00072\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n$$\\Delta s = \\frac{0.00072\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{2} = 0.00036\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nThe problem requests voltage-like quantities to be expressed in millivolts (mV). The established convention is that an energy of $1\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ corresponds to a potential-like quantity of $1\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Therefore, $\\Delta s = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ corresponds to $0.36\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Rounding to four significant figures, this is $0.3600\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nThe final answers are: $\\Delta V_{GL} \\approx 29.41\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\Delta V_{GR} \\approx 38.46\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and the PSB span $\\Delta s = 0.3600\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.",

The interdot tunneling conserves spin, so transitions between $(1,1)$ triplet and $(0,2)$ singlet are forbidden without a spin flip. Similarly, $(1,1)$ triplet to $(2,0)$ singlet is forbidden without a spin flip. Assume spin relaxation is slow compared to tunneling rates, so spin blockade can occur when the cycle traps population in a triplet configuration that cannot continue by spin-conserving transitions within the bias window.\n\nUnder forward bias (left lead is source at higher electrochemical potential, right lead is drain at lower electrochemical potential), the conventional transport cycle is $(0,1) \\rightarrow (1,1) \\rightarrow (0,2) \\rightarrow (0,1)$.

The physics of Pauli spin blockade, sequential tunneling, and energy level alignments in quantum dots are all standard and well-established concepts. The provided data are internally consistent, and the numerical values are physically realistic for such systems. The question is a direct application of the principles described. The problem statement is complete, unambiguous, and does not violate any fundamental principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe core principle of Pauli spin blockade relies on spin selection rules for interdot tunneling. Since tunneling is spin-conserving, a triplet state in the $(1,1)$ configuration, denoted $(1,1)_T$, cannot tunnel to a singlet state in a $(0,2)$ or $(2,0)$ configuration. This blocks the transport cycle if no other pathway is available.\n\nAn escape route for the blockaded $(1,1)_T$ state is to tunnel to an excited triplet state, such as $(0,2)_T$ or $(2,0)_T$. This is an inelastic process where the required energy is provided by the source-drain bias. For such a transition to be possible via sequential tunneling, the energy of the final excited state must be accessible within the bias window. The width of the bias window is given by $e|V|$. Therefore, the blockade can be lifted if the singlet-triplet splitting, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}$, which is the energy cost to reach the excited triplet state, is smaller than the bias energy, i.e., $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}  e|V|$.\n\nWe analyze the two bias polarities separately using the given parameters: $e|V| = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{meV}$, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{R} = 0.90\\,\\mathrm{meV}$, and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{L} = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{meV}$.\n\n**1. Forward Bias Analysis**\n- The source is the left lead, and the drain is the right lead.\n- The transport cycle is $(0,1) \\rightarrow (1,1) \\rightarrow (0,2) \\rightarrow (0,1)$.\n- Transport proceeds by loading an electron from the left lead onto the left dot to form a $(1,1)$ state. The two electron spins can form either a singlet $(1,1)_S$ or a triplet $(1,1)_T$.\n- If a $(1,1)_S$ state is formed, it can transition to the $(0,2)_S$ state via spin-conserving interdot tunneling. This path is open because the problem states $E_{(1,1),S} \\approx E_{(0,2),S}$, making the transition resonant.\n- If a $(1,1)_T$ state is formed, it is blockaded from transitioning to the $(0,2)_S$ state. The only spin-allowed transition is to the $(0,2)_T$ excited state.\n- The energy cost for the $(1,1)_T \\rightarrow (0,2)_T$ transition is approximately $\\Delta E = E_{(0,2),T} - E_{(1,1),T}$. Using the given energy alignments, $E_{(1,1),T} \\approx E_{(1,1),S} \\approx E_{(0,2),S}$, the energy cost is $\\Delta E \\approx E_{(0,2),T} - E_{(0,2),S} = \\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{R}$.\n- This pathway is available only if the bias provides sufficient energy, i.e., $e|V| > \\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{R}$.\n- Comparing the numerical values: $e|V| = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{R} = 0.90\\,\\mathrm{meV}$.\n- Since $0.60\\,\\mathrm{meV}  0.90\\,\\mathrm{meV}$, or $e|V|  \\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{R}$, the excited triplet state $(0,2)_T$ is energetically inaccessible. The system becomes trapped in the $(1,1)_T$ state.\n- **Conclusion for forward bias:** Pauli spin blockade occurs, and current is suppressed.\n\n**2. Reverse Bias Analysis**\n- The source is the right lead, and the drain is the left lead.\n- The transport cycle is $(1,0) \\rightarrow (1,1) \\rightarrow (2,0) \\rightarrow (1,0)$.\n- Transport proceeds by loading an electron from the right lead onto the right dot to form a $(1,1)$ state. Again, both $(1,1)_S$ and $(1,1)_T$ states can be formed.\n- The $(1,1)_S$ state can tunnel to the resonant $(2,0)_S$ state, allowing current to flow.\n- The $(1,1)_T$ state is blockaded from transitioning to $(2,0)_S$ but can potentially transition to the excited triplet state $(2,0)_T$.\n- The energy cost for the $(1,1)_T \\rightarrow (2,0)_T$ transition is approximately $\\Delta E' = E_{(2,0),T} - E_{(1,1),T}$. Using the alignments $E_{(1,1),T} \\approx E_{(1,1),S} \\approx E_{(2,0),S}$, the energy cost is $\\Delta E' \\approx E_{(2,0),T} - E_{(2,0),S} = \\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{L}$.\n- This pathway is open if $e|V| > \\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{L}$.\n- Comparing the numerical values: $e|V| = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{L} = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{meV}$.\n- Since $0.60\\,\\mathrm{meV}  0.35\\,\\mathrm{meV}$, or $e|V|  \\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{L}$, the excited triplet state $(2,0)_T$ is energetically accessible. The system, upon entering the $(1,1)_T$ state, can transition to $(2,0)_T$ and subsequently unload an electron to the left lead (drain).\n- **Conclusion for reverse bias:** The Pauli spin blockade is lifted, and current can flow.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Reversing the bias polarity changes the cycle to $(1,0) \\rightarrow (1,1) \\rightarrow (2,0) \\rightarrow (1,0)$ and can lift spin blockade because $e|V| > \\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{L}$ allows $(1,1)$ triplet to tunnel into $(2,0)$ triplet and then unload to the left lead, whereas under forward bias $e|V|  \\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{R}$ keeps $(0,2)$ triplet outside the bias window so $(1,1)$ triplet is blocked.**\n- This statement correctly identifies the transport cycle under reverse bias as given in the problem.\n- It correctly states the condition for lifting the blockade under reverse bias ($e|V| > \\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{L}$) and that this condition is met with the given values ($0.60\\,\\mathrm{meV} > 0.35\\,\\mathrm{meV}$). This allows the escape path via the $(2,0)_T$ state.\n- It also correctly states the condition for blockade under forward bias ($e|V|  \\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{R}$) and that this condition is met ($0.60\\,\\mathrm{meV}  0.90\\,\\mathrm{meV}$), leading to the blockade of the $(1,1)_T$ state because the $(0,2)_T$ state is inaccessible.\n- The entire statement is consistent with the derivation from first principles.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Spin selection rules are independent of bias polarity, so reversing the bias does not change the occurrence of spin blockade; blockade persists identically in both directions regardless of the magnitudes of $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{L}$ and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{R}$.**\n- While it is true that spin selection rules (spin conservation) are independent of bias polarity, the *consequence*—Pauli spin blockade—is not. Reversing the bias changes the path of the transport cycle, making it sensitive to the electronic structure of the other dot (from $(0,2)$ states to $(2,0)$ states). Since $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{R} \\neq \\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{L}$, the energetic conditions for lifting the blockade are different for the two bias directions. As derived, blockade occurs in one direction but not the other.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Reversing the bias opens an inelastic cotunneling channel that flips spin with unit probability, making transport insensitive to $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{L}$ and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{R}$; thus spin blockade is removed in both polarities as long as $t \\neq 0$.**\n- This statement invokes cotunneling, a higher-order process not specified as the primary mechanism; the problem is framed in the sequential tunneling regime. More importantly, it incorrectly claims this channel flips spin with unit probability and makes transport insensitive to the singlet-triplet splittings. The values of $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}$ are central to the phenomenon of spin blockade. The lifting of the blockade is explained within the sequential tunneling model by comparing $e|V|$ to these specific energy splittings.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under reverse bias, the transport cycle remains $(0,1) \\rightarrow (1,1) \\rightarrow (0,2) \\rightarrow (1,0)$, but phonon absorption at $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ll e|V|$ enables $(1,1)$ triplet to convert to $(0,2)$ singlet, removing spin blockade even if $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ST}}^{R}  e|V|$.**\n- This statement makes two fundamental errors. First, it states the incorrect transport cycle for reverse bias; the problem explicitly defines it as $(1,0) \\rightarrow (1,1) \\rightarrow (2,0) \\rightarrow (1,0)$. Second, it invokes phonon absorption, which the problem statement explicitly asks to neglect (\"negligible phonon absorption\"). The conversion from a triplet to a singlet state is a spin-flip process, which is not what phonon absorption primarily facilitates in this context.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "introduction": "Once spin blockade is identified, the next step is to quantify its strength. This problem introduces a simplified rate-equation model to derive the current suppression factor, a direct measure of how effectively transport is inhibited by the triplet state. This exercise illuminates the core principle of the blockade: the current is fundamentally limited by the ratio of the slow, spin-forbidden leakage rate $\\Gamma_T$ to the fast, spin-allowed singlet transition rate $\\Gamma_S$ .",

            "problem": "A gate-defined Double Quantum Dot (DQD) operated in the sequential tunneling regime exhibits Pauli spin blockade (PSB), where interdot motion from the $(1,1)$ configuration to the $(0,2)$ configuration is allowed for the spin singlet but strongly suppressed for the spin triplet due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Consider a bias configuration such that electrons flow from source to drain via the cycle $(0,1) \\to (1,1) \\to (0,2) \\to (0,1)$, and assume the following widely used approximations consistent with the sequential tunneling picture: (i) the interdot transition $(1,1)\\to(0,2)$ is the rate-limiting bottleneck, (ii) tunneling between a lead and its adjacent dot is much faster than the interdot step, and (iii) coherences can be neglected so that a classical master equation in terms of occupation probabilities applies. The effective interdot transition rate from the $(1,1)$ spin singlet to $(0,2)$ spin singlet is denoted by $\\Gamma_S$, while the corresponding leakage rate out of the $(1,1)$ spin triplet manifold into $(0,2)$ via weak spin-mixing mechanisms is denoted by $\\Gamma_T$, with $\\Gamma_T \\ll \\Gamma_S$ under PSB.\n\nDefine the current suppression factor $\\mathcal{S}$ under PSB when the triplet is populated as the ratio of the steady-state current when the system is prepared in the $(1,1)$ triplet manifold to the steady-state current when the system is prepared in the $(1,1)$ singlet. Starting from the standard sequential tunneling master-equation framework and the continuity of probability and charge flow, derive an analytic expression for $\\mathcal{S}$ in terms of $\\Gamma_S$ and $\\Gamma_T$ only. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression. No numerical evaluation is required, and no units are necessary because $\\mathcal{S}$ is dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for an expression for the current suppression factor, $\\mathcal{S}$, under Pauli spin blockade in a double quantum dot. The factor $\\mathcal{S}$ is defined as the ratio of the steady-state current when the system is prepared in the $(1, 1)$ triplet manifold, $I_T$, to the steady-state current when prepared in the $(1, 1)$ singlet state, $I_S$. The analysis will be based on a classical master equation framework for sequential tunneling, under the specified approximations.\n\nFirst, let us establish the general form of the steady-state current in this system. The transport of a single electron from source to drain constitutes one cycle. The current, $I$, is the product of the elementary charge, $e$, and the number of cycles completed per unit time. In a sequential process with several steps, the overall rate of the cycle is dictated by the slowest step, known as the bottleneck. The problem explicitly states in approximation (i) that the interdot transition from the $(1, 1)$ configuration to the $(0, 2)$ configuration is the rate-limiting bottleneck. Approximation (ii) states that all other transitions, including loading an electron from the source to form the $(1, 1)$ state and unloading an electron from the $(0, 2)$ state to the drain, are much faster.\n\nLet $\\Gamma_{\\text{bottleneck}}$ be the rate of the bottleneck transition. The steady-state current $I$ can be written as:\n$$I = e \\Gamma_{\\text{bottleneck}} P_{\\text{bottleneck}}$$\nwhere $P_{\\text{bottleneck}}$ is the steady-state probability of finding the system in the bottleneck state. Due to the bottleneck condition (approximations (i) and (ii)), the system, once it enters the bottleneck state, waits for a characteristic time of $1 / \\Gamma_{\\text{bottleneck}}$ to transition out. The subsequent steps to reset the system for another cycle are, by comparison, instantaneous. Consequently, in the steady-state, the system spends virtually all of its time in the bottleneck state. This implies that the occupation probability of the bottleneck state is approximately unity.\n$$P_{\\text{bottleneck}} \\approx 1$$\nTherefore, the steady-state current is directly proportional to the rate of the bottleneck transition:\n$$I \\approx e \\Gamma_{\\text{bottleneck}}$$\nWe will now apply this general result to the two specific scenarios described in the problem. The problem's phrasing, \"when the system is prepared in...\", defines two distinct, idealized transport channels, allowing for the calculation of a steady-state current for each.\n\nCase 1: System prepared in the $(1, 1)$ singlet state, $S$.\nIn this scenario, we consider transport exclusively through the singlet channel. The relevant part of the cycle is $(1, 1)S \\to (0, 2)$. The rate for this transition is given as $\\Gamma_S$. This transition is the bottleneck for this channel.\nThus, $\\Gamma_{\\text{bottleneck}} = \\Gamma_S$.\nThe corresponding steady-state current, $I_S$, is:\n$$I_S = e \\Gamma_S P_{(1, 1)S}$$\nAs argued above, the occupation probability of the bottleneck state, $P_{(1, 1)S}$, is approximately $1$.\n$$I_S \\approx e \\Gamma_S$$\nFor the purpose of deriving the analytical expression in the idealized limit defined by the problem's assumptions, we take this approximation as an equality.\n$$I_S = e \\Gamma_S$$\n\nCase 2: System prepared in the $(1, 1)$ triplet manifold, $T$.\nIn this scenario, transport is blocked due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The system is trapped in the $(1, 1)$ triplet manifold. Escape from this blockaded configuration to the $(0, 2)$ state occurs only via weak spin-mixing mechanisms, with an effective rate given as $\\Gamma_T$. This slow leakage process is the definitive bottleneck for this channel.\nThus, $\\Gamma_{\\text{bottleneck}} = \\Gamma_T$.\nThe corresponding steady-state current, $I_T$, is:\n$$I_T = e \\Gamma_T P_{(1, 1)T}$$\nThe system is blockaded, meaning it is trapped and waiting in the $(1, 1)T$ manifold. Therefore, the occupation probability of these states, $P_{(1, 1)T}$, is approximately $1$.\n$$I_T \\approx e \\Gamma_T$$\nAgain, in the idealized limit, we take this as an equality.\n$$I_T = e \\Gamma_T$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the current suppression factor $\\mathcal{S}$. It is defined as the ratio of $I_T$ to $I_S$.\n$$\\mathcal{S} = \\frac{I_T}{I_S}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\\mathcal{S} = \\frac{e \\Gamma_T}{e \\Gamma_S}$$\nThe elementary charge $e$ cancels, yielding the final expression for the suppression factor in terms of the given rates $\\Gamma_S$ and $\\Gamma_T$.\n$$\\mathcal{S} = \\frac{\\Gamma_T}{\\Gamma_S}$$\nThis result quantifies the essence of Pauli spin blockade: the current is suppressed by a factor equal to the ratio of the slow triplet leakage rate to the fast singlet transition rate.",
