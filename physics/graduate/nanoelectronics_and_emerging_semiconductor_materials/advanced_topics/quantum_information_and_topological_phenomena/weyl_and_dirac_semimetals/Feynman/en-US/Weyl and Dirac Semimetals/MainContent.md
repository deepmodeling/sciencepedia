## Introduction
In the vast landscape of solid-state materials, most are classified as insulators, semiconductors, or metals, defined by how their electronic bands are filled. However, a remarkable class of materials known as Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) defies this simple categorization. They represent a [quantum state of matter](@entry_id:196883) where electrons, through the collective effects of the crystal lattice, shed their effective mass and behave as exotic relativistic particles first theorized in [high-energy physics](@entry_id:181260). This [emergent behavior](@entry_id:138278) is not just a theoretical curiosity; it gives rise to a host of unique and robust topological phenomena with profound implications for fundamental science and future electronics. This article addresses the gap between the conventional picture of electrons in solids and the strange, relativistic world found within these materials.

To navigate this fascinating topic, we will first delve into the core theory in **Principles and Mechanisms**, exploring how crystal symmetries give birth to Weyl and Dirac points and how the concept of Berry curvature reveals them to be magnetic monopoles in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will see how these abstract principles manifest as concrete, measurable signatures—from distinctive Fermi arcs on the material's surface to the exotic [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) in transport experiments—and how they connect disparate fields like cosmology and mechanics. Finally, in **Hands-On Practices**, you will have the opportunity to solidify your understanding by engaging with computational and analytical problems that lie at the heart of research in this field.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In our journey into the quantum world of crystals, we often simplify things. We imagine electrons moving in gently curving valleys and hills—the energy bands—behaving like familiar particles, just with a modified or "effective" mass. This is a useful picture, but it misses the most dramatic features of the landscape. What happens if, deep within the crystal's [momentum space](@entry_id:148936), two of these energy bands are forced not just to approach, but to touch? At these special points of contact, the familiar rules break down, and the electrons begin to mimic some of the most exotic particles in the universe. These touching points, or **nodes**, are the birthplace of Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277).

### The Weyl Point: A Monopole in Momentum Space

Let's start with the simplest case: a linear crossing of two bands at a single point in three-dimensional [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). This is a **Weyl point**. Near this node, the effective Hamiltonian for an electron takes on a breathtakingly simple and profound form:

$$H(\mathbf{q}) \approx v \, \mathbf{q} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}$$

Here, $\mathbf{q}$ is the momentum measured relative to the node, $v$ is a velocity, and $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices. Anyone familiar with particle physics will recognize this immediately. It is the **Weyl equation** for a massless, spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle. Inside an unassuming crystal, the collective behavior of electrons has given rise to an emergent relativistic fermion!

But there's more. These Weyl nodes possess a robust, intrinsic property called **chirality**, a kind of quantum "handedness." To understand this, we need to introduce one of the most beautiful concepts in modern physics: the **Berry curvature**. Think of it this way. Einstein taught us that mass tells spacetime how to curve, and the curvature of spacetime tells mass how to move. In a crystal, the arrangement of atoms and the quantum nature of electrons create a kind of intrinsic geometry in momentum space. The Berry curvature, $\boldsymbol{\Omega}(\mathbf{k})$, is the mathematical description of this geometry. It tells us how the electron's wavefunction twists and turns as we move through the landscape of momentum.

A Weyl point is a singularity in this landscape. It acts precisely like a **[magnetic monopole](@entry_id:149129)** in momentum space . It is a point-like source (or sink) of Berry curvature. The total flux of this curvature through any closed surface surrounding the node is not just some arbitrary number; it is quantized to be an integer multiple of $2\pi$. This integer, typically $+1$ or $-1$, is the **[topological charge](@entry_id:142322)**, or **chirality**, of the Weyl node . A node with chirality $\chi=+1$ is a source, like a north pole, while a node with $\chi=-1$ is a sink, a south pole. The rigorous derivation confirms this intuition: by calculating the electron wavefunctions around the node and from them the Berry curvature, one finds that $\boldsymbol{\Omega}(\mathbf{q}) = \chi \frac{\mathbf{q}}{2|\mathbf{q}|^3}$, the field of a monopole. Integrating this over a sphere enclosing the origin yields a total flux of exactly $2\pi\chi$ .

### A Law of the Lattice: Symmetries and Node Pairing

Now, a fascinating constraint emerges from the crystal's periodic nature. The overall [momentum space](@entry_id:148936), the Brillouin zone, is a closed, periodic manifold (topologically a torus). Just as you can't have an isolated magnetic north pole without a south pole somewhere on the surface of the Earth, you cannot have a net monopole charge in the entire Brillouin zone. This is the essence of the **Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem**: the sum of the chiralities of all Weyl points in a crystal must be zero .

$$ \sum_{i \in \text{BZ}} \chi_i = 0 $$

This simple law has profound consequences. It means Weyl points must always be created in pairs of opposite chirality. You cannot have a material with just one Weyl point, or with two of the same kind and one of the other; any such configuration would have a non-zero total charge and is therefore forbidden .

This brings us to a crucial question: what protects these nodes from annihilating each other? If two bands touch, why don't they just repel and open up an energy gap? The answer is **symmetry**. The existence and stability of these nodes are dictated by the fundamental symmetries of the crystal, primarily **[time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094) (TRS)** and **inversion symmetry (IS)**.

A remarkable fact is that if a material possesses *both* TRS and IS, the Berry curvature is forced to be zero everywhere. No Berry curvature means no monopoles. Therefore, to realize a Weyl semimetal, at least one of these two fundamental symmetries must be broken .
*   If IS is broken but TRS is preserved (e.g., in a crystal with a [non-centrosymmetric](@entry_id:157488) structure), a Weyl node at momentum $\mathbf{k}$ is accompanied by a partner of the same [chirality](@entry_id:144105) at $-\mathbf{k}$. The Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem then requires at least another pair of opposite chirality, leading to a minimum of four nodes.
*   If TRS is broken but IS is preserved (e.g., in a magnetic material), a Weyl node at $\mathbf{k}$ is accompanied by a partner of opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105) at $-\mathbf{k}$. This allows for the simplest possible Weyl semimetal with just two nodes.

### The Dirac Point: A Bound State of Chirality

So what happens if a material has *both* time-reversal and [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948)? As we said, it cannot be a Weyl semimetal. However, band crossings can still occur. In this highly symmetric environment, something remarkable can happen: a Weyl point of [chirality](@entry_id:144105) $+1$ and another of [chirality](@entry_id:144105) $-1$ can be forced to occupy the *exact same point* in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936).

This composite object is a **Dirac point**. It is a four-fold degenerate crossing, which can be thought of as two overlapping, two-fold degenerate Weyl points of opposite chirality . This "neutral" object has zero net [chirality](@entry_id:144105) and is therefore compatible with the simultaneous presence of TRS and IS. If you break either of these symmetries, the glue holding the two Weyl nodes together dissolves, and the Dirac point splits into a pair of separated Weyl points .

One might think that the combination of TRS and IS would be enough to make a Dirac point perfectly stable. This turns out not to be true. The degeneracy is fragile. It's possible to write down a "mass term"—a perturbation that respects both TRS and IS—that can still mix the overlapping nodes and open a full energy gap . For a Dirac point to be truly robust, it requires protection from an *additional* crystalline symmetry, such as a [rotational symmetry](@entry_id:137077) of the lattice. This extra symmetry can forbid the mass term, ensuring the node remains gapless .

### A Tilted World: Type-I versus Type-II

Our picture of a perfect, upright cone is an idealization. In real materials, the entire energy cone can be tilted by other terms in the Hamiltonian. If the tilt is modest, we have a **Type-I** Weyl semimetal, where the Fermi surface at the node energy is still just a single point.

However, if the tilt becomes very strong, the cone can be "over-tilted" to such an extent that it lies on its side. This creates a **Type-II** Weyl semimetal . In this strange situation, the conduction and valence bands touch at the Weyl node, but they also give rise to finite electron and [hole pockets](@entry_id:269009) that meet at the node. This means that even at the node's energy, there is a finite Fermi surface consisting of the touching points of these pockets, which form a cone in momentum space. This qualitative change in the band structure dramatically alters the material's optical and transport properties, opening another fascinating chapter in the study of these materials.
