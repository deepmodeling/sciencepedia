## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having journeyed through the abstract principles of Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277), one might wonder: Is this just a beautiful mathematical construction, a physicist's fantasy played out in the space of crystal momentum? The answer is a resounding no. These ideas are not confined to chalkboards; they describe real materials that we can grow, hold, and measure. The universe of electrons within crystals like cadmium arsenide (Cd$_3$As$_2$), a classic Dirac semimetal, or tantalum arsenide (TaAs), the first discovered Weyl semimetal, is as rich and strange as any theoretical wonderland . In this chapter, we will explore the practical consequences of their unique nature, seeing how their bizarre quantum rules give rise to remarkable, measurable phenomena that are pushing the boundaries of science and technology.

### Fingerprints of a Relativistic World in a Crystal

At the heart of a Weyl or Dirac semimetal are electrons that have forgotten they have mass. Their energy is directly proportional to their momentum—a linear relationship that is the hallmark of massless relativistic particles like photons. But these are electrons, deep inside a solid. This "relativistic" behavior isn't just a superficial analogy; it leaves indelible fingerprints on the material's most basic properties.

Imagine trying to heat one of these materials. In an ordinary metal, where electron energy is quadratic with momentum, the [electronic specific heat](@entry_id:144099)—the amount of energy needed to raise its temperature—is proportional to the temperature, $T$. But for the "relativistic" electrons in an ideal, undoped Dirac or Weyl semimetal, the story is different. The density of available electronic states changes more dramatically with energy, and a careful calculation reveals that the specific heat scales with the cube of the temperature, $C_e \propto T^3$ . This is a fundamental [thermodynamic signature](@entry_id:185212), a direct message from the conical band structure that an experimenter can read with a thermometer.

What if we shine light on it? The material's response is, again, unique. An ordinary semiconductor absorbs light only above a certain [threshold frequency](@entry_id:137317) corresponding to its band gap. A typical metal absorbs broadly. A Weyl semimetal, however, exhibits an [optical conductivity](@entry_id:139437) that grows linearly with the frequency of the light, $\sigma_1(\omega) \propto \omega$ . This distinctive linear rise is another direct consequence of the cone-like meeting of the valence and conduction bands, providing a clear optical signature for experimenters to hunt for.

Perhaps the most startling consequence of this relativistic nature is how these electrons handle obstacles. In our classical world, if you throw a ball at a wall that is too high, it bounces back. In the quantum world of normal electrons, they can "tunnel" through thin barriers, but their probability of getting through drops exponentially as the barrier gets higher or wider. The chiral, massless electrons in a Weyl semimetal play by different rules. If you fire them directly at a potential barrier, even one that is insurmountably high, they pass through with 100% probability. This perfect transmission, known as Klein tunneling, is a shocking defiance of intuition . It happens because the electron's "handedness," or [chirality](@entry_id:144105), prevents it from simply turning around—the states required for reflection just aren't available. It's as if the particle has no choice but to push straight through.

### The Topological Touch: Signatures of Berry Curvature

The [linear dispersion](@entry_id:1127276) is only half the story. The truly defining feature of these materials is their topology, a robust property of the quantum wavefunctions encoded in a quantity called the Berry curvature. This curvature acts like a hidden magnetic field in momentum space, and the Weyl points are its [sources and sinks](@entry_id:263105)—its magnetic monopoles. This hidden topology is not just an abstraction; it has profound, observable consequences.

One of the most beautiful is the *[bulk-boundary correspondence](@entry_id:137647)*. The non-[trivial topology](@entry_id:154009) of the bulk *requires* the existence of strange electronic states on the surface. If you perform an experiment like Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES), which maps out the electronic states on a crystal's surface, you won't see the closed loops of a typical Fermi surface. Instead, you'll find something that shouldn't exist in a normal two-dimensional world: an open line of states, an arc that starts at the surface projection of a Weyl point of one chirality and ends at the projection of a partner with opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105) . These "Fermi arcs" are the definitive, smoking-gun signature of a Weyl semimetal. They are loose ends, topologically forbidden in a 2D system but permitted here because they are the surface manifestation of a 3D topological object.

The topology also reveals itself in more subtle ways. By placing the material in a strong magnetic field, we can force the electrons into quantized [circular orbits](@entry_id:178728) called Landau levels. As the magnetic field is varied, these levels cross the Fermi energy one by one, causing periodic oscillations in the material's resistance—the Shubnikov-de Haas effect. By measuring the period of these oscillations, we can map out the size of the Fermi surface with incredible precision . But there's a deeper secret hidden in these wiggles. If you plot the index of the Landau levels against the inverse magnetic field, you get a straight line. Where this line intercepts the axis reveals a phase shift. For a normal metal, this phase is trivial. But for a Dirac or Weyl semimetal, the intercept reveals a phase shift of $\pi$, a direct measurement of the non-trivial Berry phase accumulated by an electron as it orbits the Fermi surface . It is a direct probe of the material's hidden topological heart.

This momentum-space curvature also deflects electrons. When an electric field is applied, electrons don't just move forward; they acquire a "anomalous" sideways velocity. This leads to a Hall voltage in the transverse direction, even without an external magnetic field—the Anomalous Hall Effect. In a Weyl semimetal, the magnitude of this effect is directly proportional to the separation of the Weyl nodes in momentum space . It's a beautiful link: a microscopic, [topological property](@entry_id:141605) (node separation) dictates a macroscopic transport measurement. This principle extends beyond electricity. A temperature gradient can similarly drive a transverse voltage, an effect known as the Anomalous Nernst effect, linking thermal and electrical transport through their common topological origin .

### The Chiral Anomaly: A Quantum Puzzle Comes to Life

Perhaps the most celebrated and exotic transport signature of Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) is a direct consequence of a subtle quantum field theory effect: the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077). In simple terms, while the total number of electrons is conserved, the number of right-handed and left-handed electrons, individually, is not. When you apply an electric field ($\vec{E}$) and a magnetic field ($\vec{B}$) parallel to each other, the laws of quantum mechanics cause a "pumping" of electrons from one chirality to the other.

Imagine the two Weyl nodes of opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105) as two reservoirs of charge carriers. The parallel fields continuously pump electrons from the left-handed reservoir to the right-handed one. This creates an imbalance, a net population of carriers that are then accelerated by the electric field, generating an additional current that flows along the direction of the fields .

The stunning consequence is *[negative longitudinal magnetoresistance](@entry_id:146729)*. In any normal metal, applying a magnetic field forces electrons into curved paths, increasing scattering and thus increasing resistance. This is the common sense, positive [magnetoresistance](@entry_id:265774) we learn about. But in a Weyl semimetal, with $\vec{E}$ parallel to $\vec{B}$, this new current channel from the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) opens up. And since the pumping rate is proportional to $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B}$, this anomalous current grows with the strength of the magnetic field. The result? The total conductivity *increases*, and the resistance *decreases*, as you crank up the magnetic field. This [negative magnetoresistance](@entry_id:136874), with its characteristic quadratic dependence on the magnetic field ($\Delta\sigma \propto B^2$), is a hallmark signature that has been observed in numerous Weyl and Dirac materials, providing definitive proof that these quantum field theory concepts are alive and well inside a solid .

### Unifying Forces: Connections Across Physics

The discovery of Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) has done more than just add a new class of materials to our catalog. It has created a playground where concepts from disparate areas of physics meet and intertwine in the most fascinating ways.

**Topology and Magnetism:** What happens when the strong [electron-electron interactions](@entry_id:139900) that drive magnetism are introduced into a Dirac semimetal? A fascinating possibility emerges: the [magnetic ordering](@entry_id:143206) itself can be the mechanism that breaks symmetry and splits a Dirac point into two separated Weyl points. This creates a "Weyl-Mott insulator," a phase where topology and strong correlations are inextricably linked. In such a system, the anomalous Hall conductivity becomes directly proportional to the [staggered magnetization](@entry_id:194295), providing a new way to probe [magnetic order](@entry_id:161845) through a topological transport signature .

**Topology and Mechanics:** The connection can be even more direct. Applying mechanical strain—literally stretching or bending the crystal lattice—can act on the electrons like a magnetic field. For a specific strain pattern, the displacement of the atoms creates an effective "axial vector potential" for the electrons. This potential gives rise to a *pseudo-magnetic field* that can be just as real to the electrons as an external one. This can lead to the formation of pseudo-Landau levels, all without a single magnet in sight . This opens up the tantalizing field of "strain-tronics," where mechanical forces are used to engineer and control topological quantum states.

**Topology and Optics:** Can we create topology on demand? The field of Floquet engineering says yes. By illuminating a conventional, topologically trivial insulator with [circularly polarized light](@entry_id:198374), it's possible to "dress" the electronic states and dynamically alter the system's Hamiltonian. Under the right conditions of frequency and intensity, this can drive the system through a [topological phase transition](@entry_id:137214), opening a gap at one point in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936) while closing it at two others. In this way, a mundane insulator can be momentarily transformed into a Floquet-Weyl semimetal, with Weyl points created and controlled by a laser beam .

**A Cosmic Connection:** The deepest connection of all takes us from the lab bench to the cosmos. The effective theory of electromagnetism inside these materials includes a peculiar term that couples the electric and magnetic fields, $\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$. This is precisely the "[axion](@entry_id:156508)" term proposed decades ago in particle physics to solve a puzzle in the theory of the [strong nuclear force](@entry_id:159198). This makes Dirac and Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) a form of "[axion](@entry_id:156508) matter." The theory predicts a bizarre phenomenon: if you could place a hypothetical [magnetic monopole](@entry_id:149129) inside a Dirac semimetal, the [axion](@entry_id:156508) term would cause the monopole to attract and bind a real electric charge to itself . While we may lack [magnetic monopoles](@entry_id:142817), this underlying physics is real. These materials provide us with a tabletop laboratory to test ideas that were once the sole domain of high-energy accelerators and cosmological observation, revealing a profound and beautiful unity in the laws of nature.

The story of Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) is a testament to the power of abstract ideas in physics. What began as a curiosity in [relativistic quantum mechanics](@entry_id:148643) has blossomed into a vibrant field of materials science, offering not just novel electronic properties, but also a platform to explore the connections between quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, mechanics, and even cosmology. The journey of discovery is far from over.
