We can obtain this by inverting the series for $E(P)$.

Given that the constants $a$ and $b$ are positive and we are in the paraelectric regime where $T  T_{C}$ (so $T-T_C  0$), it is evident that $\\chi^{(3)}(T)$ is always negative.\nA negative $\\chi^{(3)}(T)$ means that the polarization response to the electric field is sub-linear. The polarization $P \\approx \\chi^{(1)}E + \\chi^{(3)}E^3$ increases less rapidly than a purely linear response as the field strength $|E|$ increases. This represents a saturation effect.\n\nAs the temperature $T$ approaches the Curie temperature $T_C$ from above ($T \\to T_C^+$), the denominator $(T-T_C)^4$ approaches zero. Consequently, the magnitude of the nonlinear susceptibility, $|\\chi^{(3)}(T)|$, diverges as $(T-T_C)^{-4}$. This divergence is much stronger than the divergence of the linear susceptibility $\\chi^{(1)}(T)$, which is proportional to $(T-T_C)^{-1}$. This extreme nonlinearity signals the imminent onset of the phase transition.\n\nThe physics below the Curie temperature ($T  T_C$) is dictated by the same LGD free energy. For $T  T_C$, the coefficient of the $P^2$ term, $a(T-T_C)$, becomes negative, leading to a double-well potential with two stable states of spontaneous polarization $P_s = \\pm\\sqrt{-a(T-T_C)/b}$. The application of an external field $E$ biases one well over the other, and cycling the field leads to switching between these states, which manifests as a polarization-electric-field ($P-E$) hysteresis loop.\n\nThe sign and magnitude of $\\chi^{(3)}(T)$ above $T_C$ are directly linked to the characteristics of this hysteresis loop below $T_C$.\n1.  **Sign and Curvature:** The negative sign of $\\chi^{(3)}$ is a direct consequence of the positive sign of the coefficient $b$. A positive $b$ is what stabilizes the ferroelectric phase at large polarization, creating the double-well potential necessary for hysteresis. The negative sign of $\\chi^{(3)}$ corresponds to a $P(E)$ curve that is concave down for $E0$, representing the saturation behavior observable as the \"shoulders\" of a hysteresis loop as polarization approaches its saturation value.\n2.  **Magnitude and Slenderness:** The divergence of $|\\chi^{(3)}(T)|$ as $T \\to T_C^+$ is a hallmark of critical phenomena. This extreme sensitivity to the field is the precursor to the formation of spontaneous polarization. Just below $T_C$, the potential wells are very shallow, and the spontaneous polarization $P_s$ and coercive field $E_c$ are small. This results in a very \"slender\" hysteresis loop. The magnitude of $|\\chi^{(3)}(T)|$ just above $T_C$ is a measure of how \"soft\" the system is and how susceptible it is to ordering. Therefore, the strong divergence of $|\\chi^{(3)}|$ as $T \\to T_C^+$ is directly correlated with the emergence of a slender hysteresis loop as the system is cooled just below $T_C$. As the temperature decreases further below $T_C$, the potential wells deepen, $P_s$ and $E_c$ increase, and the loop becomes wider and more square-like.",

If $\\omega_{1}\\gamma \\ll \\kappa$, then $W(\\omega) \\approx \\pi E_{0}^{2}\\,\\dfrac{\\omega \\gamma}{\\kappa^{2}}$, implying $W \\propto \\omega$. The experimental ratio $\\dfrac{W_{2}}{W_{1}} = \\dfrac{9.00\\times 10^{3}}{3.00\\times 10^{3}} = 3.00$ equals $\\dfrac{f_{2}}{f_{1}} = \\dfrac{3.00\\times 10^{3}}{1.00\\times 10^{3}} = 3.00$, confirming the low-frequency (linear-in-$\\omega$) regime self-consistently. Thus we solve for $\\gamma$ from\n$$\n\\gamma \\approx \\frac{W\\,\\kappa^{2}}{\\pi E_{0}^{2}\\,\\omega}.\n$$\nInsert the values at $f_{1}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{1} = 2\\pi \\times 1.00\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}, \\quad\nE_{0}^{2} = (1.00\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{V/m})^{2} = 1.00\\times 10^{12}\\,(\\mathrm{V/m})^{2}, \\quad\n\\kappa^{2} = (5.00\\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{V\\,m/C})^{2} = 2.50\\times 10^{15}\\,(\\mathrm{V\\,m/C})^{2}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\gamma \\approx \\frac{(3.00\\times 10^{3})\\times (2.50\\times 10^{15})}{\\pi \\times (1.00\\times 10^{12}) \\times (2\\pi \\times 1.00\\times 10^{3})}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\cdot m}\n= \\frac{7.50\\times 10^{18}}{2\\pi^{2}\\times 10^{15}}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\cdot m}.\n$$\nUsing $\\pi^{2} \\approx 9.8696$, one finds\n$$\n\\gamma \\approx \\frac{7.50\\times 10^{18}}{(2\\times 9.8696)\\times 10^{15}}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\cdot m}\n= \\frac{7.50\\times 10^{18}}{1.9739\\times 10^{16}}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\cdot m}\n\\approx 3.80\\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\cdot m}.\n$$\nSelf-consistency check: the crossover frequency $f_{c}$ where $\\omega \\gamma \\sim \\kappa$ is\n$$\nf_{c} \\approx \\frac{\\kappa}{2\\pi \\gamma} \\approx \\frac{5.00\\times 10^{7}}{2\\pi \\times 3.80\\times 10^{2}}\\,\\mathrm{Hz} \\approx 2.1\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{Hz},\n$$\nwhich exceeds $f_{2} = 3.00\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, validating the low-frequency approximation used to extract $\\gamma$ and explaining the observed proportionality $W\\propto f$.
