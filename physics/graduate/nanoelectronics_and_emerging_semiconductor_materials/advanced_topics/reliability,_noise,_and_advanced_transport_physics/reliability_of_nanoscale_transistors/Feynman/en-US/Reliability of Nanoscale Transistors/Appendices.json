It provides all necessary parameters, definitions, and a clear objective. There are no contradictions or factual errors. All given parameters are within realistic ranges for nanoscale MOSFETs.\n\nThe derivation of the threshold voltage shift, $\\Delta V_{T}(t)$, begins with the fundamental electrostatic relationship between charge, capacitance, and voltage for a parallel-plate capacitor. The gate, oxide, and semiconductor form a capacitor with capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$. When charge $\\Delta Q_{T}(t)$ is trapped at or near the semiconductor-oxide interface, it induces an opposite charge on the gate, which requires an additional gate voltage to maintain the same surface potential in the semiconductor. This additional voltage is the threshold voltage shift. Its magnitude is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{T}(t) = \\frac{\\Delta Q_{T}(t)}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a positive sign by stating that the trapped charge has the \"same sign as the BTI-induced charge responsible for shifting the threshold,\" so we calculate the magnitude of the shift.\n\nThe total trapped charge, $\\Delta Q_{T}(t)$, is the sum of charge trapped at the interface, $\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{it}}(t)$, and charge trapped in the bulk of the oxide, $\\Delta Q_{b}(t)$.\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{T}(t) = \\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{it}}(t) + \\Delta Q_{b}(t)\n$$\nThe problem provides expressions for the total number of occupied traps.

Immediately after stress removal at $t=0^{+}$, the drain current $I_{d}(t)$ is monitored during recovery at temperature $T$.\n\nTwo reliability mechanisms act on $I_{d}(t)$ over the recovery interval: (i) Bias Temperature Instability (BTI), which is reversible on the observation timescale because it arises from charge trapping and detrapping kinetics in the dielectric and at the interface, and (ii) Hot Carrier Degradation (HCD), which is dominated by permanent bond breakage and interface state generation on the observation timescale. Assume the following physical bases and measurement conditions:\n\n- For BTI, model the recoverable trapped-charge population as an ensemble of non-interacting states with individual occupancy $n(t)$ obeying first-order emission kinetics $\\mathrm{d}n/\\mathrm{d}t = -n/\\tau$, where $\\tau$ is the emission time constant.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established principles of semiconductor device reliability physics, is well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and uses precise, objective language.\n\n### Part 1: Recovery Signatures of BTI and HCD\n\nThis part requires deriving the expected time dependence of the drain current $I_{d}(t)$ during recovery for the two specified degradation mechanisms. The total degradation in current is the sum of the contributions from Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) and Hot Carrier Degradation (HCD):\n$$\nI_{d}(t) = I_{0} - \\Delta I_{\\text{BTI}}(t) - \\Delta I_{\\text{HCD}}(t)\n$$\nwhere $I_{0}$ is the pre-stress current, and $\\Delta I_{\\text{BTI}}(t)$ and $\\Delta I_{\\text{HCD}}(t)$ are the current reductions due to BTI and HCD, respectively.\n\n**Hot Carrier Degradation (HCD) Signature:**\nThe problem states that HCD is dominated by permanent bond breakage, rendering it irreversible on the experimental timescale. This implies that the number of defects created by HCD does not change during the recovery phase. Therefore, the current degradation due to HCD is constant:\n$$\n\\Delta I_{\\text{HCD}}(t) = \\Delta I_{\\text{HCD}}(0^{+}) = \\text{constant}\n$$\nThe signature of HCD in the recovery trace is a time-independent, permanent downward shift in the drain current.\n\n**Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) Signature:**\nBTI is described as a reversible process involving charge trapping and detrapping. The recovery is governed by charge emission from traps. For a single trap with an emission time constant $\\tau$, the occupancy $n(t)$ follows first-order kinetics:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}n}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{n}{\\tau}\n$$\nWith the initial condition $n(0)$ representing the trapped charge at the beginning of recovery ($t=0$), the solution is:\n$$\nn(t) = n(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the emission time constants are broadly and log-uniformly distributed. This means the probability density function of $x = \\ln \\tau$ is uniform:\n$$\np(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{\\ln \\tau_{\\max} - \\ln \\tau_{\\min}} & \\text{for } x \\in [\\ln \\tau_{\\min}, \\ln \\tau_{\\max}] \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe BTI-induced current degradation $\\Delta I_{\\text{BTI}}(t)$ is proportional to the total remaining trapped charge, which is the average of $n(t)$ over the distribution of time constants. The fraction of traps still occupied at time $t$ is the average of $\\exp(-t/\\tau)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta I_{\\text{BTI}}(t)}{\\Delta I_{\\text{BTI}}(0^{+})} = \\langle \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\rangle = \\int_{\\ln \\tau_{\\min}}^{\\ln \\tau_{\\max}} \\exp(-t/\\exp(x)) \\ p(x) \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\ln(\\tau_{\\max}/\\tau_{\\min})} \\int_{\\ln \\tau_{\\min}}^{\\ln \\tau_{\\max}} \\exp(-t e^{-x}) \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nA change of variables $u = 1/\\tau = e^{-x}$ gives $\\mathrm{d}x = - \\mathrm{d}u/u$. The integral becomes $\\int_{1/\\tau_{\\max}}^{1/\\tau_{\\min}} \\exp(-tu) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{u}$. For the given wide range of time constants ($\\tau_{\\min} = 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\ll t \\ll \\tau_{\\max} = 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{s}$), the function $\\exp(-t/\\tau)$ acts as a sharp step function. It is approximately $0$ for $\\tau \\ll t$ and approximately $1$ for $\\tau \\gg t$.\nTherefore, the integral for the remaining trapped fraction can be approximated by integrating over the traps that have not yet had time to emit, i.e., those with $\\tau > t$:\n$$\n\\langle \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\int_{\\ln t}^{\\ln \\tau_{\\max}} 1 \\cdot p(x) \\mathrm{d}x}{\\int_{\\ln \\tau_{\\min}}^{\\ln \\tau_{\\max}} 1 \\cdot p(x) \\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\int_{\\ln t}^{\\ln \\tau_{\\max}} \\mathrm{d}x}{\\int_{\\ln \\tau_{\\min}}^{\\ln \\tau_{\\max}} \\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\ln \\tau_{\\max} - \\ln t}{\\ln \\tau_{\\max} - \\ln \\tau_{\\min}} = \\frac{\\ln(\\tau_{\\max}/t)}{\\ln(\\tau_{\\max}/\\tau_{\\min})}\n$$\nThis approximation is valid for $\\tau_{\\min} \\ll t \\ll \\tau_{\\max}$. The BTI degradation thus follows a logarithmic decay:\n$$\n\\Delta I_{\\text{BTI}}(t) \\approx \\Delta I_{\\text{BTI}}(0^{+}) \\left( \\frac{\\ln(\\tau_{\\max}/t)}{\\ln(\\tau_{\\max}/\\tau_{\\min})} \\right)\n$$\nThe total drain current during recovery is:\n$$\nI_{d}(t) = I_{0} - \\Delta I_{\\text{HCD}} - \\Delta I_{\\text{BTI}}(0^{+}) \\left( \\frac{\\ln(\\tau_{\\max}) - \\ln(t)}{\\ln(\\tau_{\\max}/\\tau_{\\min})} \\right)\n$$\nThis shows that the drain current $I_{d}(t)$ *recovers* (increases) logarithmically with time $t$.\n\n**Contrast:** The signature of BTI is a dynamic, logarithmic recovery in drain current, reflecting the broad distribution of energy barriers for charge to escape from traps. In contrast, the signature of HCD is a static, permanent reduction in drain current, reflecting the creation of stable, non-healing structural defects.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Decision Threshold\n\nThe second task is to compute a decision threshold $\\theta$ for the recovered fraction estimator $\\widehat{F}$ to test for the presence of reversible BTI recovery.\n\nThe estimator is defined as:\n$$\n\\widehat{F} \\equiv \\frac{I_{d}(t_{2}) - I_{d}(0^{+})}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\n$$\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that only irreversible HCD is present. Under $H_0$, there is no BTI recovery, so the true value of the drain current does not change during the recovery phase. Thus, the true value is $I_{d, \\text{true}}(t) = I_{d}(0^{+})$ for all $t > 0$.\n\nThe measured current at time $t_{2} = 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s}$ includes additive noise $\\epsilon$:\n$$\nI_{d, \\text{meas}}(t_{2}) = I_{d, \\text{true}}(t_{2}) + \\epsilon = I_{d}(0^{+}) + \\epsilon\n$$\nThe noise $\\epsilon$ is given as a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and standard deviation $\\sigma = 0.03\\ \\mathrm{\\mu A}$, i.e., $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n\nSubstituting this into the estimator $\\widehat{F}$ under the null hypothesis:\n$$\n\\widehat{F}_{H_0} = \\frac{(I_{d}(0^{+}) + \\epsilon) - I_{d}(0^{+})}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\n$$\nThe problem states that $I_d(0^+)$ and $\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ are known with negligible uncertainty, so they are treated as constants. The distribution of $\\widehat{F}$ under $H_0$ is therefore also Gaussian. Its mean is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\widehat{F}} = E\\left[\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\\right] = \\frac{E[\\epsilon]}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{0}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = 0\n$$\nIts variance is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\widehat{F}}^2 = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon)}{(\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{tot}})^2} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{(\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{tot}})^2}\n$$\nThe standard deviation of the estimator is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\widehat{F}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\n$$\nPlugging in the given values, $\\sigma = 0.03\\ \\mathrm{\\mu A}$ and $\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 2\\ \\mathrm{\\mu A}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\widehat{F}} = \\frac{0.03\\ \\mathrm{\\mu A}}{2\\ \\mathrm{\\mu A}} = 0.015\n$$\nWe need to find a threshold $\\theta$ for a one-sided test such that the probability of a false alarm (rejecting $H_0$ when it is true) is no greater than $\\alpha = 10^{-3}$. A false alarm occurs when $\\widehat{F} \\geq \\theta$ under $H_0$. So we must solve:\n$$\nP(\\widehat{F} \\geq \\theta | H_0) = \\alpha\n$$\nTo solve this, we standardize the random variable $\\widehat{F}$. Let $Z$ be a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n$$\nZ = \\frac{\\widehat{F} - \\mu_{\\widehat{F}}}{\\sigma_{\\widehat{F}}} = \\frac{\\widehat{F}}{0.015}\n$$\nThe condition becomes:\n$$\nP\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{\\theta}{0.015}\\right) = \\alpha = 10^{-3}\n$$\nWe need to find the critical value $z_{\\alpha}$ from the standard normal distribution such that $P(Z \\geq z_{\\alpha}) = \\alpha$. This is the value for which the cumulative distribution function $\\Phi(z_{\\alpha}) = P(Z \\leq z_{\\alpha}) = 1 - \\alpha = 1 - 0.001 = 0.999$.\nFrom standard statistical tables or a calculator, the inverse CDF for $0.999$ is:\n$$\nz_{0.001} \\approx 3.09023\n$$\nNow we can find $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta}{0.015} = z_{0.001} \\approx 3.09023\n$$\n$$\n\\theta = 0.015 \\times 3.09023 \\approx 0.04635345\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\theta \\approx 0.04635\n$$\nThis is the quantitative decision threshold. If the measured recovered fraction $\\widehat{F}$ is greater than or equal to $0.04635$, we would reject the null hypothesis and declare that a reversible recovery component (BTI) is present, with a false alarm probability of $0.1\\%$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided to derive the required sample size.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the continuous sample size $n_{\\mathrm{cont}}$ required to achieve a specified confidence interval half-width for the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of the Weibull shape parameter, $\\beta$. The derivation proceeds by first calculating the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for the Weibull parameters.\n\nThe two-parameter Weibull probability density function (PDF) for breakdown time $T$ is given by:\n$$f(t;\\beta,\\eta) = \\frac{\\beta}{\\eta} \\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta}\\right)^{\\beta-1} \\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right], \\quad t > 0$$\nwhere $\\beta > 0$ is the shape parameter and $\\eta > 0$ is the scale parameter.\n\nThe problem specifies a reparameterization of the scale parameter: $\\lambda = \\ln \\eta$, which implies $\\eta = \\exp(\\lambda)$. Substituting this into the PDF gives:\n$$f(t;\\beta,\\lambda) = \\beta \\exp(-\\lambda) \\left(t \\exp(-\\lambda)\\right)^{\\beta-1} \\exp\\left[-\\left(t \\exp(-\\lambda)\\right)^{\\beta}\\right]$$\n$$f(t;\\beta,\\lambda) = \\beta t^{\\beta-1} \\exp(-\\lambda\\beta) \\exp\\left[-t^{\\beta} \\exp(-\\lambda\\beta)\\right]$$\nThe log-likelihood for a single observation $t$ is $\\ell(\\beta, \\lambda; t) = \\ln f(t;\\beta,\\lambda)$:\n$$\\ell(\\beta, \\lambda; t) = \\ln(\\beta) + (\\beta-1)\\ln(t) - \\lambda\\beta - t^{\\beta} \\exp(-\\lambda\\beta)$$\n\nThe Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for a single observation is given by $I(\\beta, \\lambda)$, where its elements are $I_{ij} = -E\\left[\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\theta_i \\partial \\theta_j}\\right]$, with $\\theta = (\\beta, \\lambda)$. We first compute the second partial derivatives of the log-likelihood.\n\nThe first partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ell}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{1}{\\beta} + \\ln(t) - \\lambda - (\\ln(t) - \\lambda) t^{\\beta} \\exp(-\\lambda\\beta)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ell}{\\partial \\lambda} = -\\beta + \\beta t^{\\beta} \\exp(-\\lambda\\beta)$$\n\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\beta^2} = -\\frac{1}{\\beta^2} - (\\ln(t) - \\lambda)^2 t^{\\beta} \\exp(-\\lambda\\beta)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\lambda^2} = -\\beta^2 t^{\\beta} \\exp(-\\lambda\\beta)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\beta \\partial \\lambda} = -1 + (1 + \\beta(\\ln(t)-\\lambda)) t^{\\beta} \\exp(-\\lambda\\beta)$$\n\nTo compute the expectations, we introduce the transformation $Y = (t/\\eta)^{\\beta} = t^{\\beta}\\exp(-\\lambda\\beta)$. The random variable $Y$ follows a standard exponential distribution, $Y \\sim \\text{Exp}(1)$, with PDF $g(y) = \\exp(-y)$ for $y>0$. We also note that $\\ln(t) - \\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\ln(Y)$. The second derivatives can be rewritten in terms of $Y$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\beta^2} = -\\frac{1}{\\beta^2} - \\left(\\frac{\\ln Y}{\\beta}\\right)^2 Y = -\\frac{1}{\\beta^2} \\left(1 + Y(\\ln Y)^2\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\lambda^2} = -\\beta^2 Y$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\beta \\partial \\lambda} = -1 + (1 + \\ln Y)Y$$\n\nThe elements of the FIM are the negative expectations of these quantities. We use the following standard expectations for $Y \\sim \\text{Exp}(1)$, where $\\gamma \\approx 0.5772$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant:\n$E[Y] = 1$\n$E[Y \\ln Y] = \\int_0^\\infty y \\ln(y) \\exp(-y) dy = \\Gamma'(2) = 1-\\gamma$\n$E[Y (\\ln Y)^2] = \\int_0^\\infty y (\\ln y)^2 \\exp(-y) dy = \\Gamma''(2) = (1-\\gamma)^2 + \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}-1 = \\gamma^2 - 2\\gamma + \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$\n\nNow we compute the FIM elements:\n$I_{11} = -E\\left[\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\beta^2}\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\beta^2} E\\left[1 + Y(\\ln Y)^2\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\beta^2} (1 + E[Y(\\ln Y)^2]) = \\frac{1}{\\beta^2}\\left(1 + \\gamma^2 - 2\\gamma + \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\right) = \\frac{(\\gamma-1)^2 + \\pi^2/6}{\\beta^2}$\n$I_{22} = -E\\left[\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\lambda^2}\\right] = \\beta^2 E[Y] = \\beta^2$\n$I_{12} = I_{21} = -E\\left[\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\beta \\partial \\lambda}\\right] = -E[-1 + Y + Y\\ln Y] = 1 - E[Y] - E[Y \\ln Y] = 1 - 1 - (1-\\gamma) = \\gamma-1$\n\nThe Fisher Information Matrix for a single observation is:\n$$I(\\beta, \\lambda) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{(\\gamma-1)^2 + \\pi^2/6}{\\beta^2} & \\gamma-1 \\\\ \\gamma-1 & \\beta^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n$$\\det(I) = \\left(\\frac{(\\gamma-1)^2 + \\pi^2/6}{\\beta^2}\\right)(\\beta^2) - (\\gamma-1)^2 = (\\gamma-1)^2 + \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} - (\\gamma-1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$\nThe inverse of the FIM is:\n$$I^{-1}(\\beta, \\lambda) = \\frac{1}{\\det(I)} \\begin{pmatrix} I_{22} & -I_{12} \\\\ -I_{21} & I_{11} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{6}{\\pi^2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta^2 & -(\\gamma-1) \\\\ -(\\gamma-1) & \\frac{(\\gamma-1)^2 + \\pi^2/6}{\\beta^2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe asymptotic variance-covariance matrix for the MLEs $(\\hat{\\beta}, \\hat{\\lambda})$ from a sample of size $n$ is $\\frac{1}{n}I^{-1}(\\beta, \\lambda)$. The asymptotic variance of $\\hat{\\beta}$ is the $(1,1)$ element of this matrix:\n$$\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\left(I^{-1}\\right)_{11} = \\frac{1}{n} \\frac{6\\beta^2}{\\pi^2}$$\nFor a large sample, the $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\\beta$ is $\\hat{\\beta} \\pm w$, where the half-width $w$ is given by:\n$$w = z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta})}$$\nFor planning purposes, we use the anticipated value $\\beta_0$ for $\\beta$ in the variance expression.\n$$w = z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{6\\beta_0^2}{n_{\\mathrm{cont}}\\pi^2}} = \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}\\beta_0\\sqrt{6}}{ \\pi \\sqrt{n_{\\mathrm{cont}}}}$$\nSolving for the continuous sample size $n_{\\mathrm{cont}}$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{cont}} = \\frac{6 z_{\\alpha/2}^2 \\beta_0^2}{\\pi^2 w^2}$$\nNow, we substitute the given design values: $\\beta_0 = 1.7$, $\\alpha = 0.05$, and $w = 0.08$.\nFor a confidence level of $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, we need the standard normal quantile $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025}$.\n$z_{0.025} \\approx 1.959964$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{cont}} = \\frac{6 \\times (1.959964)^2 \\times (1.7)^2}{\\pi^2 \\times (0.08)^2}$$\n$$n_{\\mathrm{cont}} = \\frac{6 \\times 3.841459 \\times 2.89}{9.869604 \\times 0.0064}$$\n$$n_{\\mathrm{cont}} = \\frac{66.611184}{0.06316547} \\approx 1054.5493$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{cont}} = 1055$$",
