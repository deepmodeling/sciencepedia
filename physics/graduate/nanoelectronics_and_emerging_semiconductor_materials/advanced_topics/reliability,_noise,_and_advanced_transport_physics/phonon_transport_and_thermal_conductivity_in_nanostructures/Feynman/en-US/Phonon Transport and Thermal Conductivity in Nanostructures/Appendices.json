Let $x = \\Lambda' / \\Lambda_0$. This implies $d\\Lambda' = \\Lambda_0 \\,dx$. The limits of integration transform as follows: when $\\Lambda' = 0$, $x = 0$; when $\\Lambda' = \\Lambda$, $x = \\Lambda / \\Lambda_0$.

For a phonon mode with a bulk relaxation time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$, the total relaxation time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in the film is given by $1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{bulk}} + 1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{boundary}}$.\n\nSince the MFP is proportional to the relaxation time ($\\Lambda = v_g \\tau$), this rule can be written in terms of MFPs for each phonon mode:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\Lambda)} = \\frac{1}{\\Lambda} + \\frac{1}{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{boundary}}}\n$$\nHere, $\\Lambda$ represents the bulk MFP of a given mode (which is the integration variable in our distribution $D(\\Lambda)$), and $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\Lambda)$ is its effective MFP in the film. For cross-plane transport with fully diffuse boundary scattering, the boundary-limited MFP is approximated by the film thickness $L$. Thus, $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{boundary}} \\approx L$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\Lambda)} = \\frac{1}{\\Lambda} + \\frac{1}{L}\n$$\nSolving for $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\Lambda)$ gives:\n$$\n\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\Lambda) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Lambda} + \\frac{1}{L}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{\\Lambda L}{\\Lambda + L} = \\frac{\\Lambda}{1 + \\Lambda/L}\n$$\nThe contribution of each phonon mode to the total thermal conductivity is proportional to its MFP. The boundary scattering suppresses the contribution of each mode by a factor equal to the ratio of the effective MFP to the bulk MFP.
