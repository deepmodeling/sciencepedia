            "problem": "A monolayer semiconductor nanoresistor fabricated from an emerging two-dimensional material is characterized at thermal equilibrium. Its terminal response over the measurement band is well-approximated as purely resistive, with a real, frequency-independent resistance $R$. A high-impedance spectrum analyzer measures the open-circuit voltage noise power spectral density $S_{V}(f)$ across the device under equilibrium biasing. For system-level stochastic circuit simulations, you wish to replace the device by its Norton representation: a parallel current noise source $i_{n}(t)$ with current noise spectral density $S_{I}(f)$ in parallel with the same resistance $R$.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of autocorrelation and power spectral density and from linear time-invariant input-output relations, derive an expression for $S_{I}(f)$ in terms of the measured $S_{V}(f)$ and the resistance $R$. In your derivation, explicitly state the assumptions you make about any correlation between the internal noise source and the device impedance, and justify when these assumptions are valid for a passive resistor in thermal equilibrium in the classical regime.

No numerical evaluation or rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the Norton equivalent current noise power spectral density, $S_I(f)$, of a resistor, given its Thévenin equivalent open-circuit voltage noise power spectral density, $S_V(f)$, and its resistance, $R$. The derivation must proceed from fundamental principles of linear systems and spectral analysis, without direct invocation of the formula for Johnson-Nyquist noise.\n\nA physical resistor exhibiting thermal noise can be represented by two equivalent circuit models for the purpose of network analysis.\n\nThe first model is the Thévenin equivalent circuit. This consists of an ideal, noiseless resistor with resistance $R$ in series with a noise voltage source, which we denote as $v_n(t)$. The open-circuit voltage measured across the terminals of this component, $v_{oc}(t)$, is simply the voltage of this internal source, since no current flows through the series resistor $R$.\n$$v_{oc}(t) = v_n(t)$$\nThe problem states that the measured open-circuit voltage noise power spectral density is $S_V(f)$. The power spectral density (PSD) of a stationary stochastic process $x(t)$ is defined as the Fourier transform of its autocorrelation function $R_{xx}(\\tau) = E[x(t)x(t+\\tau)]$. By definition, $S_V(f)$ is the PSD of the process $v_{oc}(t)$, which is identical to the PSD of the Thévenin noise voltage source, $v_n(t)$.\n\nThe second model is the Norton equivalent circuit. This consists of the same ideal, noiseless resistor with resistance $R$ in parallel with a noise current source, $i_n(t)$. The PSD of this current source is the quantity we wish to find, $S_I(f)$.\n\nFor these two models to be equivalent, they must be indistinguishable from their terminals. This means they must produce the same voltage and current response for any external network connected to them. A sufficient condition for equivalence is that they must have the same open-circuit voltage and the same short-circuit current. Let us focus on the open-circuit voltage.\n\nIn the Norton model, the open-circuit voltage $v_{oc}(t)$ is the voltage that develops across the parallel resistor $R$ when no external load is connected. Under this condition, the entire current from the source $i_n(t)$ must flow through the resistor $R$. According to Ohm's Law, the resulting terminal voltage is:\n$$v_{oc}(t) = i_n(t) \\cdot R$$\nThis equation describes a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The input to the system is the stochastic process $i_n(t)$, and the output is the stochastic process $v_{oc}(t)$. Since the resistance $R$ is given as real and frequency-independent, the system is a simple scaling operation. The impulse response of this system is $h(t) = R \\cdot \\delta(t)$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nThe transfer function of the LTI system, $H(f)$, is the Fourier transform of the impulse response:\n$$H(f) = \\mathcal{F}\\{h(t)\\} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(t) \\exp(-j 2\\pi f t) dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} R \\cdot \\delta(t) \\exp(-j 2\\pi f t) dt = R$$\nFor any LTI system, the PSD of the output signal, $S_{\\text{out}}(f)$, is related to the PSD of the input signal, $S_{\\text{in}}(f)$, by the relation:\n$$S_{\\text{out}}(f) = |H(f)|^2 S_{\\text{in}}(f)$$\nIn our specific case, the input signal is $i_n(t)$ with PSD $S_I(f)$, and the output signal is the open-circuit voltage $v_{oc}(t)$, whose PSD must match the measured $S_V(f)$ for equivalence. Therefore, we have:\n$$S_V(f) = |H(f)|^2 S_I(f)$$\nSubstituting $H(f) = R$, we get:\n$$S_V(f) = |R|^2 S_I(f)$$\nSince $R$ is a real resistance, $|R|^2 = R^2$. The equation becomes:\n$$S_V(f) = R^2 S_I(f)$$\nSolving for the desired current noise power spectral density, $S_I(f)$, we find:\n$$S_I(f) = \\frac{S_V(f)}{R^2}$$\nThis derivation relies on a crucial assumption that must be justified.\n\nAssumption: Both the Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuit models are constructed by separating the device's behavior into an ideal dissipative element (the noiseless resistor $R$) and an ideal noise source ($v_n(t)$ or $i_n(t)$). This construction assumes that the stochastic process describing the noise source is statistically independent of the macroscopic parameter $R$. In other words, the instantaneous fluctuations are not correlated with the value of the resistance.\n\nJustification: This assumption is physically well-founded for a passive resistor in thermal equilibrium. The noise originates from the random thermal motion of charge carriers within the material. The resistance, on the other hand, is a macroscopic parameter that quantifies the average rate of energy dissipation when a current flows. The Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) provides the fundamental link between these two concepts. It states that the magnitude of the thermal fluctuations (quantified by the PSD) is determined by the magnitude of the dissipation (quantified by $R$) and the temperature $T$. For example, the FDT predicts $S_V(f) = 4 k_B T R$ in the classical limit ($\\hbar 2\\pi f \\ll k_B T$) assumed in the problem. While the FDT shows that the *value* of the PSD depends on the *value* of $R$, it supports the modeling assumption that the underlying random process generating the noise is independent of the resistance parameter itself. The separation of the device into an independent noise source and a noiseless resistor is a valid and standard modeling technique for systems in or near thermal equilibrium. Any correlation would imply a more complex, likely non-equilibrium or non-linear, physical process not described by this problem.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe thermal noise generated by the resistor $R_s$ can be modeled, according to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, by a Thévenin equivalent circuit. This circuit consists of an ideal, noiseless resistor of resistance $R_s$ in series with a random voltage source, $v_n(t)$. For frequencies where the quantum effects are negligible ($hf \\ll k_B T$, which is an excellent approximation at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ for frequencies up to many terahertz), the one-sided power spectral density (PSD) of the noise voltage is white, given by:\n$$S_v(f) = 4k_B T R_s$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The mean-square noise voltage $\\langle v_n^2 \\rangle$ in a one-sided frequency bandwidth $B$ is the integral of the PSD over that bandwidth. Since the PSD is constant (white noise), this is simply:\n$$\\langle v_n^2 \\rangle = S_v(f) \\times B = 4k_B T R_s B$$\n\nThe source, with its Thévenin equivalent resistance $R_s$, is connected to an ideal transmission line of characteristic impedance $Z_0$. The line is terminated by a load impedance $Z_L = Z_0$. For a lossless transmission line terminated in its characteristic impedance, the input impedance seen at the source end of the line is equal to $Z_0$ for all frequencies. The problem states this explicitly.\n\nTherefore, the circuit for analysis comprises the noise voltage source $v_n$ in series with the source resistance $R_s$, which is connected to a load resistance $Z_0$. This forms a simple voltage divider. The voltage across the load, $v_L(t)$, is given by:\n$$v_L(t) = v_n(t) \\frac{Z_0}{R_s + Z_0}$$\nThe mean-square voltage across the load, $\\langle v_L^2 \\rangle$, can be related to the mean-square source voltage $\\langle v_n^2 \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle v_L^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\left( v_n(t) \\frac{Z_0}{R_s + Z_0} \\right)^2 \\rangle = \\langle v_n^2 \\rangle \\left( \\frac{Z_0}{R_s + Z_0} \\right)^2$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\langle v_n^2 \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle v_L^2 \\rangle = (4k_B T R_s B) \\left( \\frac{Z_0}{R_s + Z_0} \\right)^2$$\nThe average power $P_L$ delivered to the real load impedance $Z_0$ is given by $P_L = \\frac{\\langle v_L^2 \\rangle}{Z_0}$.\n$$P_L = \\frac{1}{Z_0} (4k_B T R_s B) \\left( \\frac{Z_0}{R_s + Z_0} \\right)^2$$\n$$P_L = 4k_B T R_s B \\frac{Z_0^2}{Z_0(R_s + Z_0)^2} = 4k_B T B \\frac{R_s Z_0}{(R_s + Z_0)^2}$$\nThis is the expression for the noise power delivered to the load.\n\n**1.

The material conductivity is $\\sigma(T)$ and the electron system is in local equilibrium, so that the local electron temperature is $T(x)$, with $x \\in [0,L]$. You measure the voltage noise spectral density across the nanowire with a broadband low-noise amplifier under two operating conditions: (i) open-circuit (no direct current) while an external microheater imposes a controlled and known gradient $T(x)$, and (ii) finite direct current $I$, where Joule heating modifies $T(x)$ but the contact temperatures remain fixed.\n\nStarting from fundamental principles and well-tested facts (local equilibrium, the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem for resistive elements, and conservation of energy in diffusive transport), reason about how a spatially varying $T(x)$ inside the resistor changes the observed thermal voltage noise compared to the equilibrium case of uniform temperature. Then, identify an experimentally sound strategy to distinguish this excess thermal noise from shot noise in a measurement on the same device.\n\nWhich option most accurately explains the origin of the excess thermal noise and proposes a valid measurement discriminant from shot noise?\n\nA. In a resistor with a temperature gradient, each differential segment $dx$ acts as a local thermal noise source whose contribution is proportional to its local temperature $T(x)$ and differential resistance $dR = dx/[\\sigma(T(x))A]$. Integrating these locally generated equilibrium voltage fluctuations yields an effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ weighted by $dR$, so that hotter, more resistive segments contribute disproportionately to the total voltage noise, producing an excess above the uniform-temperature expectation. To distinguish this from shot noise, measure the noise under open-circuit while sinusoidally modulating the heater power to modulate $T(x)$; the thermal noise power will track the temperature modulation at zero direct current, whereas shot noise requires finite $I$ and will not appear in the open-circuit configuration. Alternatively, measure the current noise spectral density as a function of $I$ and extract the zero-current intercept associated with thermal noise independently of the linear-in-$I$ component associated with shot noise.\n\nB. The excess noise arises because the temperature gradient activates defects, producing dominant $1/f$ noise that exceeds the equilibrium thermal noise. The best way to distinguish this from shot noise is to look only at the spectral slope: if the spectrum is white, it is shot noise; if it is $1/f$, it is thermal noise.\n\nC. The temperature gradient generates a deterministic thermoelectric voltage via the Seebeck effect, which directly adds to the random thermal voltage fluctuations and therefore increases the measured noise. To distinguish it from shot noise, reverse the temperature gradient; if the noise changes sign, it is thermoelectric and not shot noise.\n\nD. Shot noise increases strongly with temperature because hotter electrons arrive more frequently, so the temperature gradient boosts shot noise above the equilibrium thermal level. The most reliable discriminator is to cool the device; if the noise drops significantly with reduced temperature at fixed current, it must be shot noise.\n\nE. The excess above the equilibrium thermal level is caused by quantum zero-point fluctuations that dominate at all temperatures due to the finite impedance of the nanowire. To distinguish from shot noise, measure only at very high frequencies where zero-point fluctuations overwhelm classical noise processes.",

I will proceed with the derivation and evaluation of options.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Solution\n\n**1. Origin of Thermal Noise in a Non-Uniform Temperature Profile**\n\nThe foundation of thermal noise in a resistor at uniform temperature $T$ is the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. For frequencies $f$ where $hf \\ll k_B T$, the one-sided voltage noise power spectral density $S_V$ is given by the Johnson-Nyquist formula:\n$$S_V = 4k_B T R$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $R$ is the resistance.\n\nThe problem states that the nanowire is in *local equilibrium*. This is the critical principle that allows us to extend the equilibrium formula to this non-equilibrium steady-state situation. We can consider the nanowire as a series of infinitesimal segments, each of length $dx$. Each segment is at a well-defined local temperature $T(x)$ and has a differential resistance $dR$.\n\nThe resistance of a segment of length $dx$ and cross-sectional area $A$ is given by:\n$$dR = \\frac{\\rho(T(x))}{A} dx = \\frac{1}{\\sigma(T(x)) A} dx$$\nwhere $\\rho(T(x))$ is the local resistivity and $\\sigma(T(x))$ is the local conductivity.\n\nBecause each segment is in local equilibrium at temperature $T(x)$, it acts as an independent thermal noise source generating a voltage noise spectral density $dS_V$:\n$$dS_V(x) = 4k_B T(x) dR$$\n\nThe thermal fluctuations in different segments of the resistor are uncorrelated. Therefore, the total noise power spectral density is the sum (integral) of the noise powers from each segment:\n$$S_{V, \\text{total}} = \\int dS_V(x) = \\int_0^L 4k_B T(x) dR = \\int_0^L 4k_B T(x) \\frac{dx}{\\sigma(T(x)) A}$$\n\nThis can be expressed using an effective noise temperature, $T_{\\text{eff}}$, defined by $S_{V, \\text{total}} = 4k_B T_{\\text{eff}} R_{\\text{total}}$. Equating the two expressions gives:\n$$4k_B T_{\\text{eff}} R_{\\text{total}} = \\int_0^L 4k_B T(x) dR$$\n$$T_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\int_0^L T(x) dR}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\int_0^L T(x) \\frac{dx}{\\sigma(T(x)) A}}{\\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{\\sigma(T(x)) A}}$$\nThis equation shows that the effective noise temperature is an average of the local temperature $T(x)$, but weighted by the local differential resistance $dR$. Segments that are hotter (higher $T(x)$) and/or more resistive (higher $dR$) contribute more significantly to the total measured noise. This is the origin of the \"excess\" thermal noise compared to a naive average temperature.\n\n**2. Discrimination from Shot Noise**\n\nShot noise arises from the discreteness of charge carriers. The current noise spectral density for shot noise is given by:\n$$S_I = 2 F q |I|$$\nwhere $I$ is the direct current, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $F$ is the Fano factor, which accounts for correlations in the charge transport ($F=1$ for uncorrelated Poissonian transport). The crucial property of shot noise is that it is directly proportional to the magnitude of the DC current $|I|$ and vanishes when $I=0$.\n\nIn contrast, thermal noise is present even at zero current ($I=0$), as it is caused by the thermal agitation of charge carriers. Its voltage spectral density is $S_V = 4k_B T_{\\text{eff}} R_{\\text{total}}$.\n\nThis fundamental difference in dependence on current $I$ provides a clear experimental discriminant:\n-   **Method 1 (Zero-Current Measurement):** Perform the noise measurement under open-circuit conditions ($I=0$). Any noise measured under this condition cannot be shot noise. If the measured noise power changes in response to a change in the temperature profile $T(x)$ (e.g., by modulating an external heater), this confirms the noise is thermal in origin.\n-   **Method 2 (Current-Dependent Measurement):** Measure the total noise spectral density as a function of the DC current $I$. The total current noise, $S_{I,\\text{total}}$, will be a sum of the thermal and shot noise contributions:\n    $$S_{I,\\text{total}}(I) = S_{I,\\text{thermal}} + S_{I,\\text{shot}} = \\frac{4k_B T_{\\text{eff}}(I)}{R_{\\text{total}}(I)} + 2 F q |I|$$\n    Note that $T_{\\text{eff}}$ and $R_{\\text{total}}$ can also depend on $I$ due to Joule heating. However, a plot of $S_{I,\\text{total}}$ versus $|I|$ will show a non-zero intercept at $|I|=0$ corresponding to the thermal noise term, $\\frac{4k_B T_{\\text{eff}}(0)}{R_{\\text{total}}(0)}$, and a component that grows with $|I|$, which is characteristic of shot noise. By analyzing the dependence on $I$, the two contributions can be separated.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In a resistor with a temperature gradient, each differential segment $dx$ acts as a local thermal noise source whose contribution is proportional to its local temperature $T(x)$ and differential resistance $dR = dx/[\\sigma(T(x))A]$. Integrating these locally generated equilibrium voltage fluctuations yields an effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ weighted by $dR$, so that hotter, more resistive segments contribute disproportionately to the total voltage noise, producing an excess above the uniform-temperature expectation. To distinguish this from shot noise, measure the noise under open-circuit while sinusoidally modulating the heater power to modulate $T(x)$; the thermal noise power will track the temperature modulation at zero direct current, whereas shot noise requires finite $I$ and will not appear in the open-circuit configuration. Alternatively, measure the current noise spectral density as a function of $I$ and extract the zero-current intercept associated with thermal noise independently of the linear-in-$I$ component associated with shot noise.**\n-   **Analysis:** This option perfectly matches the derivation. The explanation of the origin of the excess thermal noise is precise, correctly invoking local equilibrium and the resistance-weighting of temperature. Both proposed experimental discriminants are valid, standard, and robust methods based on the fundamental properties of thermal and shot noise.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The excess noise arises because the temperature gradient activates defects, producing dominant $1/f$ noise that exceeds the equilibrium thermal noise. The best way to distinguish this from shot noise is to look only at the spectral slope: if the spectrum is white, it is shot noise; if it is $1/f$, it is thermal noise.**\n-   **Analysis:** This explanation attributes the excess noise to a different physical mechanism ($1/f$ noise), which may or may not be present but is not the \"thermal noise\" the problem describes. The proposed discriminant is factually incorrect. Both classical thermal noise ($4k_BTR$) and shot noise ($2qI$) are \"white\" (frequency-independent) over a wide frequency range. $1/f$ noise has a $1/f$ spectrum by definition. The statement wrongly identifies thermal noise as having a $1/f$ spectrum and shot noise as being uniquely white.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The temperature gradient generates a deterministic thermoelectric voltage via the Seebeck effect, which directly adds to the random thermal voltage fluctuations and therefore increases the measured noise. To distinguish it from shot noise, reverse the temperature gradient; if the noise changes sign, it is thermoelectric and not shot noise.**\n-   **Analysis:** This option fundamentally misunderstands the nature of noise. The Seebeck effect produces a DC voltage offset (a change in the mean voltage), not an increase in the fluctuations about the mean (the noise power or variance). Noise power is proportional to $\\langle (\\Delta V)^2 \\rangle$ and is always a positive quantity; it cannot \"change sign\". While the Seebeck voltage $V_S$ changes sign upon reversing the temperature gradient, the noise power does not.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Shot noise increases strongly with temperature because hotter electrons arrive more frequently, so the temperature gradient boosts shot noise above the equilibrium thermal level. The most reliable discriminator is to cool the device; if the noise drops significantly with reduced temperature at fixed current, it must be shot noise.**\n-   **Analysis:** The premise that shot noise increases strongly with temperature is generally incorrect for the standard model ($S_I = 2Fq|I|$). The dominant temperature-dependent noise in a resistor is thermal noise ($S_V \\propto T$). The proposed discriminator is ambiguous; cooling the device reduces thermal noise, so observing a drop in total noise upon cooling is expected regardless and does not uniquely identify the shot noise component.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The excess above the equilibrium thermal level is caused by quantum zero-point fluctuations that dominate at all temperatures due to the finite impedance of the nanowire. To distinguish from shot noise, measure only at very high frequencies where zero-point fluctuations overwhelm classical noise processes.**\n-   **Analysis:** Zero-point fluctuations are a quantum effect that becomes dominant only at very low temperatures or very high frequencies (i.e., when $hf \\gtrsim k_B T$). The claim that they \"dominate at all temperatures\" is false. The effect described in the problem is predominantly a classical statistical mechanics phenomenon well-described by the local equilibrium model. Distinguishing thermal and shot noise is most effectively done by analyzing their dependence on current, not by moving to a difficult-to-access high-frequency quantum regime.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
