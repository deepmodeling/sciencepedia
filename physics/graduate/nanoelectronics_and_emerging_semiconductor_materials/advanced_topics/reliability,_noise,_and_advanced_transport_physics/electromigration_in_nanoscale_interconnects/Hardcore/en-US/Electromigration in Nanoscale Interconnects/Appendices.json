            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid-state physics, is well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution without any contradictions.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the magnitude of the electromigration driving force, $F_{EM}$, on a single copper atom and then evaluate it numerically. The derivation begins from two fundamental principles as instructed: the electrostatic force on a charge and Ohm's law.\n\nThe electromigration force is modeled as the force exerted by the local electric field, $E$, on an ion with an effective charge, $q_{eff}$. The effective charge accounts for both the direct electrostatic force on the ion core and the momentum transfer from the electron wind. This force is given by the standard electrostatic formula:\n$$\nF_{EM} = q_{eff} E\n$$\nThe effective charge, $q_{eff}$, is defined in terms of the effective charge number, $Z^*$, and the elementary charge, $e$, as:\n$$\nq_{eff} = Z^* e\n$$\nSubstituting this into the force equation yields:\n$$\nF_{EM} = Z^* e E\n$$\nThe next step is to relate the electric field, $E$, to the macroscopic current density, $J$, and the material's resistivity, $\\rho$. This relationship is given by the microscopic form of Ohm's law:\n$$\nE = \\rho J\n$$\nBy substituting this expression for $E$ into the equation for $F_{EM}$, we obtain the desired expression for the electromigration driving force in terms of the specified parameters:\n$$\nF_{EM} = Z^* e \\rho J\n$$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of this force, which we denote as $|F_{EM}|$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the electromigration-driven atomic flux, $J_{a,\\mathrm{em}}$, and its subsequent numerical evaluation for a copper interconnect under specific conditions.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation. The transport of atoms under the influence of various driving forces can be described by the drift-diffusion framework, often expressed by the Nernst-Planck equation. The total atomic flux, $\\vec{J}_a$, is the sum of a diffusion component driven by the concentration gradient ($-\\nabla C$) and a drift component driven by an external force, $\\vec{F}$. The problem specifically concerns the electromigration-driven component, which is a drift flux.\n\nThe drift flux is given by the expression:\n$$ \\vec{J}_{a, \\text{drift}} = M C \\vec{F} $$\nwhere $C$ is the atomic concentration (atoms per unit volume), $M$ is the atomic mobility (velocity per unit force), and $\\vec{F}$ is the driving force on an atom.\n\nFor electromigration, the driving force, $\\vec{F}_{\\mathrm{em}}$, is due to the momentum transfer from charge carriers (the \"electron wind\") and the direct electrostatic force on the ionized atom. This net force is conveniently expressed in terms of an effective charge number, $Z^*$, the elementary charge, $e$, and the electric field, $\\vec{E}$:\n$$ \\vec{F}_{\\mathrm{em}} = Z^* e \\vec{E} $$\nA negative value of $Z^*$ indicates that the dominant force is from the electron wind, pushing the atoms in the direction of electron flow (opposite to the conventional current and the electric field).\n\nThe electromigration-driven component of the atomic flux, $\\vec{J}_{a,\\mathrm{em}}$, is therefore:\n$$ \\vec{J}_{a,\\mathrm{em}} = M C (Z^* e \\vec{E}) $$\n\nThe problem requires us to use the Einstein relation, which connects atomic mobility, $M$, to atomic diffusivity, $D$. This relation is:\n$$ D = M k_{B} T $$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Solving for mobility, we get:\n$$ M = \\frac{D}{k_{B} T} $$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $M$ into the flux equation yields the desired relationship for the electromigration flux in terms of the specified variables:\n$$ \\vec{J}_{a,\\mathrm{em}} = \\frac{D C Z^* e}{k_{B} T} \\vec{E} $$\n\nThe problem defines the positive flux direction as the direction of conventional current. This is the direction of the current density vector $\\vec{j}$ and the electric field vector $\\vec{E}$. The scalar flux component in this direction, $J_{a,\\mathrm{em}}$, is therefore related to the magnitude of the electric field, $E$, by:\n$$ J_{a,\\mathrm{em}} = \\frac{D C Z^* e E}{k_{B} T} $$\n\nTo evaluate this expression numerically, we first need to find the electric field magnitude, $E$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe atomic flux, $J_a$, is driven by the gradient of the chemical potential, $\\mu_a$. In a more general context, the flux is proportional to the net force acting on the atoms. The condition for zero atomic flux ($J_a=0$) is that the net force, $F_{\\mathrm{net}}$, on the atoms is zero.\nIn this system, there are two opposing forces acting on each atom along the one-dimensional line ($x$-axis):\n1.  The electron-wind force, $F_{\\mathrm{ew}}$, which drives atomic migration.\n2.  The force arising from the gradient of mechanical stress, $F_{\\sigma}$, which opposes the atomic pile-up.\n\nThe net force is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{net}} = F_{\\mathrm{ew}} + F_{\\sigma}$$\nFor the flux to vanish at steady state, $F_{\\mathrm{net}} = 0$, which implies:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ew}} = -F_{\\sigma}$$\nThe problem states that the electron-wind force per atom is $F_{\\mathrm{ew}} = Z^{*} e E$. Using the given relation $E = \\rho J$, we have:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ew}} = Z^{*} e \\rho J$$\nThe chemical potential contribution from a hydrostatic stress $\\sigma$ is $-\\sigma \\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the atomic volume. The force is the negative gradient of this potential energy:\n$$F_{\\sigma} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-\\sigma \\Omega) = \\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}$$\nHere, we assume the atomic volume $\\Omega$ is constant with respect to position.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the forces into the balance equation:\n$$Z^{*} e \\rho J = -\\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}$$\nThis equation gives the stress gradient required to counteract the electron-wind force:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{Z^{*} e \\rho J}{\\Omega}$$\nThe problem states that the stress builds linearly along the line, which is consistent with this constant stress gradient. To find the total stress difference $\\Delta\\sigma$ over a line of length $L$, we integrate this expression from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n$$\\Delta\\sigma = \\sigma(L) - \\sigma(0) = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(-\\frac{Z^{*} e \\rho J}{\\Omega}\\right) dx$$\nSince all terms on the right are constant with respect to $x$, the integration yields:\n$$\\Delta\\sigma = -\\frac{Z^{*} e \\rho J}{\\Omega} L$$\nElectromigration is halted when the line length $L$ is short enough that the maximum sustainable stress difference, $\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}}$, is reached. This length is the critical length, $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. The quantity $\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}}$ is given as a positive magnitude. We must therefore take the absolute value of the expression. Given that $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ must be a positive quantity, we have:\n$$\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\left|-\\frac{Z^{*} e \\rho J}{\\Omega} L_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\right| = \\frac{|Z^{*}| e \\rho |J|}{\\Omega} L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$$\nNote that $Z^{*}$ for copper is negative, which physically means the momentum transfer from electrons pushes the copper atoms in the direction of electron flow (opposite to the conventional current $J$). The use of absolute values $|Z^{*}|$ and $|J|$ ensures that all quantities in the final expression are positive magnitudes.\n\nSolving for the critical length $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{\\Omega \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}}}{|Z^{*}| e \\rho |J|}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nFirst, we convert all given parameters to the International System of Units (SI).\n- $\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}} = 400\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 400 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 4 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $\\Omega = 1.18 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}}$\n- $|Z^{*}| = |-8| = 8$\n- $\\rho = 3\\,\\mu\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{cm} = 3 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\Omega \\cdot (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 3 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}$\n- $J = 6 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{A/cm^{2}} = 6 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{A} / (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2} = 6 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{A} / 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}} = 6 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{A/m^{2}}$\n- $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nNow, we substitute these SI values into the derived expression for $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{(1.18 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}}) (4 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa})}{(8) (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) (3 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}) (6 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{A/m^{2}})}$$\nLet's evaluate the numerator and the denominator separately.\nNumerator:\n$$N = (1.18 \\times 10^{-29}) \\cdot (4 \\times 10^{8}) = 4.72 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nDenominator:\n$$D = (8) \\cdot (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^{-8}) \\cdot (6 \\times 10^{10})$$\n$$D = (8 \\cdot 1.602176634 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6) \\times 10^{-19-8+10} = 230.7134... \\times 10^{-17} = 2.307134... \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{J/m}$$\nNow, we compute the ratio:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{N}{D} = \\frac{4.72 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{2.307134... \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{J/m}} \\approx 2.04584 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in micrometers ($\\mathrm{\\mu m}$).
