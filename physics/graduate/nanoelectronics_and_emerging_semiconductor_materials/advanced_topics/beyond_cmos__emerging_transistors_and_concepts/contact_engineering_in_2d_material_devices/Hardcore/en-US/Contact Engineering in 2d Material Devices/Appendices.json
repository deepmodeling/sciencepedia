            "problem": "A monolayer two-dimensional semiconductor channel of uniform width $W$ is patterned into a Transmission Line Method (TLM) test structure with multiple two-terminal spacings $L$ and identical top contacts of length $L_c$ along the transport direction. Each two-terminal measurement probes a channel section of length $L$ between two contacts. Assume the following physically justified conditions and definitions: (i) the channel can be modeled as a two-dimensional resistor with sheet resistance $R_s$ (in $\\Omega/\\square$) so that a rectangular strip of length $L$ and width $W$ has channel resistance $R_{\\text{ch}}=R_s L/W$, (ii) the metal/semiconductor interface is characterized by a uniform specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$ (in $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{area}$) that gives rise to current crowding under the contacts, and (iii) the contacts are sufficiently long compared to the characteristic transfer length so that end effects are negligible and the distributed contact model applies.\n\nYou are given measurements of the total two-terminal resistance $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$ for five spacings $L$ on the same chip, all with the same channel width and contact metallization:\n\n- Channel width $W=10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- Contact length $L_c=2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- Measured pairs $\\{L, R_{\\text{tot}}(L)\\}$:\n  - $\\{0.5\\,\\mu\\text{m},\\,350\\,\\Omega\\}$,\n  - $\\{1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m},\\,600\\,\\Omega\\}$,\n  - $\\{1.5\\,\\mu\\text{m},\\,850\\,\\Omega\\}$,\n  - $\\{2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m},\\,1350\\,\\Omega\\}$,\n  - $\\{4.0\\,\\mu\\text{m},\\,2100\\,\\Omega\\}$.\n\nStarting from the distributed resistive model for a two-dimensional sheet contacted through a finite interface resistivity, derive the governing relations needed to (a) express $R_{\\text{tot}}(L)$ in terms of the sheet resistance $R_s$, the contact resistance per contact $R_c$, and the device geometry, and (b) relate $R_c$, $R_s$, the specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$, and the transfer length $L_T$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It describes a standard application of the Transmission Line Method (TLM), a fundamental technique in semiconductor device characterization for extracting contact and sheet resistances. The provided model, assumptions, and data are physically realistic and consistent, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages: first, deriving the necessary theoretical relations, and second, applying these relations to the provided experimental data to extract the physical parameters of interest.\n\n(a) Derivation of the total resistance expression $R_\\text{tot}(L)$:\nThe total two-terminal resistance, $R_\\text{tot}$, measured between any two contacts in the TLM structure is the series sum of three components: the resistance of the semiconductor channel between the contacts, $R_\\text{ch}$, and the resistance of the two contacts, $R_c$, through which current is injected and extracted.\n$$\nR_\\text{tot} = R_\\text{ch} + 2R_c\n$$\nAs stated in the problem (i), the channel is a uniform two-dimensional resistor. The resistance of a rectangular sheet is given by its sheet resistance, $R_s$ (in units of $\\Omega/\\square$), multiplied by the number of squares, which is the ratio of its length $L$ to its width $W$.\n$$\nR_\\text{ch} = R_s \\frac{L}{W}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $R_\\text{tot}$ gives the fundamental TLM equation:\n$$\nR_\\text{tot}(L) = \\frac{R_s}{W} L + 2R_c\n$$\nThis equation shows that $R_\\text{tot}$ is a linear function of the channel length $L$. It has the form $y = mx + b$, where the slope is $m = \\frac{R_s}{W}$ and the y-intercept (at $L=0$) is $b = 2R_c$.\n\n(b) Derivation of the contact resistance relations:\nThe contact resistance $R_c$ arises from current transfer from the three-dimensional metal contact to the two-dimensional semiconductor sheet over a contact area of $L_c \\times W$. Due to the finite sheet resistance of the semiconductor under the contact, current preferentially flows into the semiconductor near the contact edge, a phenomenon known as current crowding. This is described by a distributed resistor model.\n\nThe model is governed by the differential equations for voltage $V(x)$ and current $I(x)$ in the semiconductor sheet under the contact, where $x$ is the distance from the leading edge of the contact:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dx} = -I(x) \\frac{R_s}{W}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dx} = -\\frac{V(x)}{\\rho_c / W} = -\\frac{W}{\\rho_c} V(x)\n$$\nHere, $\\rho_c$ is the specific contact resistivity (in $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{area}$). Differentiating the first equation and substituting the second yields a second-order ordinary differential equation for the current $I(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 I}{dx^2} = -\\frac{R_s}{W} \\frac{dI}{dx} = \\frac{R_s}{\\rho_c} I(x)\n$$\nThis equation can be written as $\\frac{d^2 I}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{L_T^2} I(x) = 0$, where we have defined the characteristic transfer length $L_T$ as:\n$$\nL_T = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c}{R_s}}\n$$\nThis length scale $L_T$ represents the average distance current travels in the semiconductor under the contact before flowing into the metal. The general solution for the voltage is $V(x) = A\\exp(x/L_T) + B\\exp(-x/L_T)$. The contact resistance $R_c$ is the ratio of the voltage at the contact edge, $V(0)$, to the total current entering the contact, $I_0$. Assuming negligible end effects (as specified in the problem), which corresponds to the limit of a long contact ($L_c \\gg L_T$), the solution simplifies significantly. In this limit, the resistance of a single contact is found to be:\n$$\nR_c = \\frac{R_s L_T}{W}\n$$\nThis is the second key relation, which connects the macroscopic contact resistance $R_c$ to the microscopic material properties $R_s$ and $\\rho_c$ (via $L_T$) and the device geometry $W$.\n\nParameter Extraction:\nThe provided data consists of pairs $\\{\\left(L, R_{\\text{tot}}(L)\\right)\\}$. We fit this data to the linear model $R_\\text{tot}(L) = mL + b$.\nData:\n$\\{\\left(0.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 350\\,\\Omega\\right)\\}$,\n$\\{\\left(1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 600\\,\\Omega\\right)\\}$,\n$\\{\\left(1.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 850\\,\\Omega\\right)\\}$,\n$\\{\\left(2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 1350\\,\\Omega\\right)\\}$,\n$\\{\\left(4.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 2100\\,\\Omega\\right)\\}$.\n\nA linear regression on these data points yields the slope $m$ and y-intercept $b$. By inspection, the data lie perfectly on a line. For instance, between $L=1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and $L=1.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, the slope is $(850 - 600)\\,\\Omega / (1.5 - 1.0)\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 250/0.5 = 500\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m}$.\nUsing $L=1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, we find the intercept $b = R_\\text{tot}(1.0) - m \\times 1.0 = 600\\,\\Omega - (500\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m})(1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}) = 100\\,\\Omega$.\nSo, the best-fit line is $R_{\\text{tot}}(L) = 500L + 100$.\n\nSlope: $m = 500\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m}$.\nY-intercept: $b = 100\\,\\Omega$.\n\nNow we extract the parameters:\n1.  **Sheet Resistance ($R_s$)**:\n    From the slope, $m = \\frac{R_s}{W}$. The channel width is given as $W = 10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n    $$\n    R_s = m \\times W = (500\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m}) \\times (10\\,\\mu\\text{m}) = 5000\\,\\Omega/\\square\n    $$\n    Rounded to three significant figures, $R_s = 5.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\Omega/\\square$.\n\n2.  **Contact Resistance ($R_c$)**:\n    From the y-intercept, $b = 2R_c$.\n    $$\n    R_c = \\frac{b}{2} = \\frac{100\\,\\Omega}{2} = 50\\,\\Omega\n    $$\n    Rounded to three significant figures, $R_c = 50.0\\,\\Omega$.\n\n3.  **Transfer Length ($L_T$)**:\n    Using the relation $R_c = \\frac{R_s L_T}{W}$, we can solve for $L_T$.\n    $$\n    L_T = \\frac{R_c W}{R_s} = \\frac{(50\\,\\Omega) \\times (10\\,\\mu\\text{m})}{5000\\,\\Omega/\\square} = \\frac{500}{5000}\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.1\\,\\mu\\text{m}\n    $$\n    Rounded to three significant figures, $L_T = 0.100\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n    We must check the validity of the long-contact assumption ($L_c \\gg L_T$). We have $L_c = 2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and $L_T = 0.1\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. The ratio is $L_c / L_T = 2 / 0.1 = 20$. Since $20 \\gg 1$, the assumption is fully justified.\n\n4.  **Specific Contact Resistivity ($\\rho_c$)**:\n    Using the definition of the transfer length, $L_T = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c}{R_s}}$, we can solve for $\\rho_c$.\n    $$\n    \\rho_c = R_s L_T^2 = (5000\\,\\Omega/\\square) \\times (0.1\\,\\mu\\text{m})^2 = 5000 \\times 0.01\\,\\Omega \\cdot \\mu\\text{m}^2 = 50\\,\\Omega \\cdot \\mu\\text{m}^2\n    $$\n    The problem requires the final value in units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^2$. We use the conversion factor $1\\,\\text{cm} = 10^4\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, which implies $1\\,\\text{cm}^2 = 10^8\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2$.\n    $$\n    \\rho_c = 50\\,\\Omega \\cdot \\mu\\text{m}^2 \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{cm}^2}{10^8\\,\\mu\\text{m}^2} = 50 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^2 = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^2\n    $$\n    Rounded to three significant figures, $\\rho_c = 5.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^2$.\n\nThe final extracted values, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n- $R_c = 50.0\\,\\Omega$\n- $R_s = 5.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\Omega/\\square$\n- $\\rho_c = 5.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^2$\n- $L_T = 0.100\\,\\mu\\text{m}$",

            "introduction": "Having learned how to measure contact properties, we now turn to a fundamental challenge that complicates contact design: Fermi-level pinning. In an ideal world, the Schottky barrier height would be a simple, tunable function of the metal's work function, but interface states often \"pin\" the Fermi level, weakening this dependence. This practice explores the concept of the pinning factor ($S$) and connects this non-ideal behavior to tangible experimental signatures you would observe in device measurements .",

            "problem": "A monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) channel is contacted by a metal, forming a Schottky contact for electron injection. In such metal/semiconductor contacts, the Schottky barrier height for electrons, denoted by $\\Phi_{B}$, depends on the metal work function, denoted by $W_{m}$, but this dependence is reduced by Fermi-level pinning at the interface. The degree of pinning is quantified by the pinning factor $S$, defined as the differential response $S \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\Phi_{B}}{\\partial W_{m}}$ evaluated at the operating bias point. Consider a device where the experimentally measured $S$ at the metal/TMD interface is $S=0.2$ and is approximately constant over a small range of $W_{m}$ around the operating point.\n\nA contact material is changed to another metal whose work function is larger by $\\Delta W_{m} = 0.5\\,\\text{eV}$, while all other interface properties are kept nominally identical. Starting from the definition of the pinning factor and using only first-order variations consistent with the given $S$, determine the resulting change in Schottky barrier height $\\Delta \\Phi_{B}$ for electron injection. Express your final answer in electronvolts (eV) and round to three significant figures.\n\nThen, using the thermionic emission picture as the fundamental transport mechanism at the contact, discuss what experimental signatures you would expect to observe in temperature-dependent current–voltage (I–V) measurements, including how the apparent activation energy extracted from Arrhenius analysis and the on-current at fixed bias would change between the two contacts. Your discussion should be qualitative but grounded in equations derived from first principles; however, only the computed $\\Delta \\Phi_{B}$ will be graded numerically.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid-state physics and nanoelectronics, specifically concerning Schottky contacts and Fermi-level pinning at metal/2D-semiconductor interfaces. The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information to compute the required quantity and support the qualitative discussion.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires the calculation of the change in Schottky barrier height, $\\Delta \\Phi_{B}$. The pinning factor, $S$, is defined as the rate of change of the Schottky barrier height for electrons, $\\Phi_{B}$, with respect to the metal work function, $W_{m}$. This is expressed mathematically as:\n$$\nS \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\Phi_{B}}{\\partial W_{m}}\n$$\nThe problem states that $S$ is approximately constant over the relevant range of work functions. This allows us to approximate the differential relationship with a finite-difference relationship for small, discrete changes. For a change in the metal work function, $\\Delta W_{m}$, the corresponding first-order change in the Schottky barrier height, $\\Delta \\Phi_{B}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Phi_{B} \\approx S \\cdot \\Delta W_{m}\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\nThe pinning factor, $S = 0.2$.\nThe change in the metal work function, $\\Delta W_{m} = 0.5\\,\\text{eV}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation yields the change in the Schottky barrier height:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Phi_{B} = (0.2) \\cdot (0.5\\,\\text{eV}) = 0.1\\,\\text{eV}\n$$\nThe problem requests the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the result is $\\Delta \\Phi_{B} = 0.100\\,\\text{eV}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a qualitative discussion of the experimental signatures expected in temperature-dependent current-voltage ($I$-$V$) measurements, based on the thermionic emission model. The current density, $J$, across a Schottky barrier according to the thermionic emission theory is given by:\n$$\nJ = A^{*} T^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Phi_{B}}{k_B T}\\right) \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right]\n$$\nwhere $A^{*}$ is the effective Richardson constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $V$ is the applied voltage. The total current $I$ is the product of the current density and the contact area, $A_{c}$, so $I = A_{c}J$.\n\nFrom our calculation, the change to a metal with a larger work function results in a positive $\\Delta \\Phi_{B}$, meaning the Schottky barrier height for electrons increases by $0.100\\,\\text{eV}$. Let the original barrier be $\\Phi_{B,1}$ and the new barrier be $\\Phi_{B,2}$. Then $\\Phi_{B,2} = \\Phi_{B,1} + \\Delta \\Phi_{B}$. We can now analyze the experimental consequences.\n\n1.  **Change in On-Current:** The on-current is the current measured at a fixed forward bias, say $V_{on}$, where $V_{on} > 0$ and typically $eV_{on} \\gg k_B T$. In this regime, the current is approximated by:\n    $$\n    I_{on} \\approx A_{c} A^{*} T^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Phi_{B}}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{eV_{on}}{k_B T}\\right)\n    $$\n    The current is exponentially dependent on the negative of the barrier height, $I_{on} \\propto \\exp(-\\Phi_{B})$. Since the new contact has a larger barrier height ($\\Phi_{B,2} > \\Phi_{B,1}$), the on-current for the new device, $I_{on,2}$, will be exponentially smaller than the on-current for the original device, $I_{on,1}$, at the same voltage and temperature. The expected signature is a significant reduction in the magnitude of the current in the forward bias \"on\" state.\n\n2.  **Apparent Activation Energy from Arrhenius Analysis:** Temperature-dependent $I$-$V$ measurements are often used to extract the Schottky barrier height. This is typically done by measuring the reverse saturation current, $I_s$. For a reverse bias ($V < 0$) such that $|eV| \\gg k_B T$, the current saturates to $I_s = A_{c} J_s$, where the saturation current density is:\n    $$\n    J_s = A^{*} T^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Phi_{B}}{k_B T}\\right)\n    $$\n    To perform an Arrhenius analysis, this equation is rearranged:\n    $$\n    \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_s}{T^2}\\right) = \\ln(A_{c}A^{*}) - \\frac{\\Phi_{B}}{k_B T}\n    $$\n    An Arrhenius plot is constructed by plotting $\\ln(I_s/T^2)$ versus $1/T$. The resulting graph should be a straight line with a slope equal to $-\\frac{\\Phi_{B}}{k_B}$. The apparent activation energy extracted from this analysis is therefore the Schottky barrier height, $\\Phi_{B}$, itself (in units of energy if the slope is multiplied by $-k_B$).\n\n    Since the new contact material increases the Schottky barrier height by $\\Delta \\Phi_{B} = 0.100\\,\\text{eV}$, the experimental signature in temperature-dependent measurements will be a change in the slope of the Arrhenius plot. For the new device, the slope will be more negative. Consequently, the apparent activation energy extracted from this analysis will be higher by $0.100\\,\\text{eV}$ compared to the device with the original contact metal.\n\nIn summary, changing to the metal with the higher work function increases the Schottky barrier, which would be experimentally observed as a lower on-current and a larger activation energy derived from an Arrhenius analysis of temperature-dependent current measurements.",

Two contact architectures are fabricated on nominally identical channels: a top contact and an etched edge contact. A standard Transmission Line Model (TLM) measurement reports that the contact resistance $R_c$ of the etched edge contact is one-half of that of the top contact under otherwise identical geometric and material conditions, specifically the same device width $W$, contact length $L_c$ sufficiently larger than any characteristic injection length, and the same channel sheet resistance $R_s$.\n\nStarting from first principles appropriate to distributed transport under a metal contact on a Two-Dimensional (2D) semiconductor, use:\n\n- charge continuity along the sheet under the metal,\n- Ohm’s law for lateral transport in a resistive sheet characterized by $R_s$ (ohms per square),\n- and a phenomenological interfacial conductance per unit area $G_c$ (with $G_c = 1/\\rho_c$, where $\\rho_c$ is the specific contact resistivity),\n\nto derive the long-contact ($L_c \\gg L_T$) relationship between the contact resistance $R_c$, the sheet resistance $R_s$, the specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$, and the device width $W$.

Let $V(x)$ be the potential in the 2D semiconductor sheet at position $x$ and $I(x)$ be the lateral current flowing in the sheet at that position.\n\nAccording to Ohm's law for lateral transport, the voltage drop $dV$ across an infinitesimal segment $dx$ of the semiconductor sheet is related to the current $I(x)$ and the sheet resistance $R_s$.

The vertical current density, $J_c(x)$, is given by the product of the interfacial conductance per unit area, $G_c$, and the potential difference across the interface, $(V_M - V(x)) = (0-V(x)) = -V(x)$.

Therefore, for a long contact, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\nR_c = \\frac{R_s L_T}{W}\n$$\nSubstituting $L_T = \\sqrt{\\rho_c/R_s}$:\n$$\nR_c = \\frac{R_s}{W} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c}{R_s}} = \\frac{1}{W} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_s^2 \\rho_c}{R_s}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{R_s \\rho_c}}{W}\n$$\nThis is the required relationship for the contact resistance in the long-contact limit.\n\nWe are given the expressions for the top and edge contacts:\n$$\nR_c^{\\mathrm{top}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{R_s^{\\mathrm{top}} \\rho_c^{\\mathrm{top}}}}{W^{\\mathrm{top}}}\n$$\n$$\nR_c^{\\mathrm{edge}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{R_s^{\\mathrm{edge}} \\rho_c^{\\mathrm{edge}}}}{W^{\\mathrm{edge}}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the channel sheet resistance $R_s$ and device width $W$ are identical for both contact types. Thus, $R_s^{\\mathrm{top}} = R_s^{\\mathrm{edge}} = R_s$ and $W^{\\mathrm{top}} = W^{\\mathrm{edge}} = W$. The expressions become:\n$$\nR_c^{\\mathrm{top}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{R_s \\rho_c^{\\mathrm{top}}}}{W}\n$$\n$$\nR_c^{\\mathrm{edge}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{R_s \\rho_c^{\\mathrm{edge}}}}{W}\n$$\nWe are given the experimental finding that $R_c^{\\mathrm{edge}} = \\frac{1}{2} R_c^{\\mathrm{top}}$. Substituting the formulas:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sqrt{R_s \\rho_c^{\\mathrm{edge}}}}{W} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{R_s \\rho_c^{\\mathrm{top}}}}{W} \\right)\n$$\nThe term $\\sqrt{R_s}/W$ is non-zero and common to both sides, so it can be canceled:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\rho_c^{\\mathrm{edge}}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\rho_c^{\\mathrm{top}}}\n$$\nSquaring both sides of the equation yields:\n$$\n\\rho_c^{\\mathrm{edge}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\rho_c^{\\mathrm{top}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\rho_c^{\\mathrm{top}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\rho_c^{\\mathrm{edge}} / \\rho_c^{\\mathrm{top}}$. Rearranging the equation, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_c^{\\mathrm{edge}}}{\\rho_c^{\\mathrm{top}}} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nThe phenomenon of current crowding describes the non-uniform injection of current from a metal contact into a semiconductor sheet. The current density is highest at the leading edge of the contact (where current enters from the channel) and decays exponentially into the contact region. The characteristic length scale of this decay is the transfer length, $L_T = \\sqrt{\\rho_c/R_s}$.\n\nThe severity of current crowding is inversely related to $L_T$. A small specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$ results in a small $L_T$. This means the current transfer is confined to a very narrow region at the contact edge, leading to severe crowding. Conversely, a large $\\rho_c$ yields a large $L_T$, distributing the current injection over a wider area and reducing crowding.\n\nIn a **top contact** architecture, the metal is deposited on the surface of the $\\text{MoS}_2$ sheet. Charge injection must occur vertically across the metal-semiconductor interface. This interface is often a van der Waals gap, which can present a significant tunnel barrier, or a region with a Schottky barrier. Both effects contribute to a relatively high specific contact resistivity, $\\rho_c^{\\mathrm{top}}$. This leads to a larger transfer length, $L_T^{\\mathrm{top}}$, and less severe current crowding.\n\nIn an **etched edge contact** architecture, the edge of the $\\text{MoS}_2$ sheet is exposed (e.g., by plasma etching), and the metal is deposited to make direct contact with this edge. This allows current to be injected \"in-plane\" into the conductive layers of the $\\text{MoS}_2$. This geometry can facilitate stronger chemical bonding (e.g., covalent bonding) between the metal and the semiconductor's edge states, bypassing the high-resistance vertical tunneling path of the top contact. This more efficient charge injection pathway plausibly leads to a significantly lower specific contact resistivity, $\\rho_c^{\\mathrm{edge}} \\ll \\rho_c^{\\mathrm{top}}$, as confirmed by our calculation where $\\rho_c^{\\mathrm{edge}}$ is four times smaller than $\\rho_c^{\\mathrm{top}}$.\n\nConsequently, the transfer length for the edge contact, $L_T^{\\mathrm{edge}} = \\sqrt{\\rho_c^{\\mathrm{edge}}/R_s}$, will be shorter than for the top contact, $L_T^{\\mathrm{top}}$. As $L_T^{\\mathrm{edge}} = L_T^{\\mathrm{top}} / \\sqrt{4} = L_T^{\\mathrm{top}} / 2$. This implies that while the edge contact has a superior (lower) overall contact resistance $R_c$, the current injection is more severely crowded at its leading edge compared to the top contact. The significant reduction in $\\rho_c$ is the dominant factor that lowers $R_c$, outweighing any effects of increased crowding.",
