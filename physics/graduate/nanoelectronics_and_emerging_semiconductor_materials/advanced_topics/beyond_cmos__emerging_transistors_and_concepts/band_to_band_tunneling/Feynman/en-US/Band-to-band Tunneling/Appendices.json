            "problem": "Consider an abrupt p-n junction in a direct-gap semiconductor under the depletion approximation, where the immobile ionized acceptors on the $p$-side and ionized donors on the $n$-side provide a uniform space charge density in their respective depletion regions. Let the acceptor density be $N_{A}$ and the donor density be $N_{D}$, and assume the semiconductor has a uniform static permittivity $\\epsilon_{s}$. Denote the elementary charge by $q$. Let the junction be reverse biased by an applied voltage $V_{R}$, so that the total potential drop across the depletion region is $V = V_{bi} + V_{R}$, where $V_{bi}$ is the built-in potential at thermal equilibrium. Let the depletion widths into the $p$ and $n$ sides be $x_{p}$ and $x_{n}$, respectively, and define the total depletion width $W = x_{p} + x_{n}$.

The concept of band-to-band tunneling (related to Zener breakdown) being triggered by a critical electric field is a well-established physical principle. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution for the requested quantity, $V_{R}^{\\star}$. No flaws are identified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nWe begin by solving Poisson's equation to find the electric field profile $F(x)$ across the depletion region.\n\n**1. Electric Field in the $p$-side Depletion Region ($-x_{p} \\le x \\le 0$)**\nThe Poisson equation is $\\frac{d F}{d x} = \\frac{-q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}}$.\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$F(x) = \\int \\frac{-q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}} dx = \\frac{-q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}} x + C_{1}$$\nUsing the boundary condition $F(-x_{p}) = 0$:\n$$0 = \\frac{-q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}} (-x_{p}) + C_{1} \\implies C_{1} = -\\frac{q N_{A} x_{p}}{\\epsilon_{s}}$$\nThus, the electric field in the $p$-side is:\n$$F(x) = -\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}} (x + x_{p})$$\n\n**2. Electric Field in the $n$-side Depletion Region ($0 \\le x \\le x_{n}$)**\nThe Poisson equation is $\\frac{d F}{d x} = \\frac{+q N_{D}}{\\epsilon_{s}}$.\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$F(x) = \\int \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\epsilon_{s}} dx = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\epsilon_{s}} x + C_{2}$$\nUsing the boundary condition $F(x_{n}) = 0$:\n$$0 = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\epsilon_{s}} x_{n} + C_{2} \\implies C_{2} = -\\frac{q N_{D} x_{n}}{\\epsilon_{s}}$$\nThus, the electric field in the $n$-side is:\n$$F(x) = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\epsilon_{s}} (x - x_{n})$$\n\n**3. Peak Electric Field and Charge Neutrality**\nThe electric field must be continuous at the metallurgical junction, $x = 0$.\n$$F(x=0^{-}) = -\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}} x_{p}$$\n$$F(x=0^{+}) = -\\frac{q N_{D}}{\\epsilon_{s}} x_{n}$$\nEquating these gives the charge neutrality condition for the depletion region:\n$$-\\frac{q N_{A} x_{p}}{\\epsilon_{s}} = -\\frac{q N_{D} x_{n}}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\implies q N_{A} x_{p} = q N_{D} x_{n}$$\nThe field is maximal at $x=0$. The peak field magnitude is $F_{\\max} = |F(0)|$:\n$$F_{\\max} = \\frac{q N_{A} x_{p}}{\\epsilon_{s}} = \\frac{q N_{D} x_{n}}{\\epsilon_{s}}$$\n\n**4. Total Potential Drop and Depletion Width**\nThe total potential drop $V$ across the junction is the integral of the electric field from $-x_{p}$ to $x_{n}$. Geometrically, this is the area of the triangular-shaped field profile.\n$$V = -\\int_{-x_{p}}^{x_{n}} F(x) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{base}) \\times (\\text{height}) = \\frac{1}{2} (x_{p} + x_{n}) F_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2} W F_{\\max}$$\n\n**5. Expressing $F_{\\max}$ and $W$ in terms of $V$**\nWe need to relate $W$ and $F_{\\max}$ to the doping concentrations. From the charge neutrality condition $N_{A} x_{p} = N_{D} x_{n}$ and the total width $W = x_{p} + x_{n}$, we can solve for $x_{p}$ and $x_{n}$:\n$$x_{p} = W \\frac{N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_{n} = W \\frac{N_{A}}{N_{A} + N_{D}}$$\nSubstitute the expression for $x_{p}$ into the equation for $F_{\\max}$:\n$$F_{\\max} = \\frac{q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\left( W \\frac{N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}} \\right) = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}} W$$\nWe now have a system of two equations relating $V$, $W$, and $F_{\\max}$:\n$$V = \\frac{1}{2} W F_{\\max}$$\n$$F_{\\max} = \\left( \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}} \\right) W$$\nFrom the second equation, we express $W$ in terms of $F_{\\max}$:\n$$W = F_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_{s}}{q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}} \\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n$$V = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ F_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_{s}}{q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}} \\right) \\right] F_{\\max} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{s}}{2q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}} F_{\\max}^{2}$$\nSolving for $F_{\\max}$ in terms of $V$:\n$$F_{\\max}^{2} = \\frac{2qV}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}} \\implies F_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2qV}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}}}$$\nTo find $W$ in terms of $V$, we use $W = 2V/F_{\\max}$:\n$$W = \\frac{2V}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2qV}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4V^{2} \\epsilon_{s} (N_{A} + N_{D})}{2qV N_{A} N_{D}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2V\\epsilon_{s}}{q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}}}$$\n\n**6. Deriving the Minimum Reverse Bias for BTBT**\nThe condition for the onset of strong BTBT is that the peak field reaches the critical value, $F_{\\max} = F_{c}$. We use the relationship derived between the total potential $V$ and $F_{\\max}$:\n$$V = \\frac{\\epsilon_{s}}{2q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}} F_{\\max}^{2}$$\nAt the onset of tunneling, we set $F_{\\max} = F_{c}$ and the corresponding total potential is $V = V_{bi} + V_{R}^{\\star}$:\n$$V_{bi} + V_{R}^{\\star} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{s} F_{c}^{2}}{2q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}}$$\nSolving for the minimum required reverse bias, $V_{R}^{\\star}$:\n$$V_{R}^{\\star} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{s} F_{c}^{2}}{2q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}} - V_{bi}$$\nThe expression can also be written as:\n$$V_{R}^{\\star} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{s} F_{c}^{2}}{2q} \\left( \\frac{1}{N_{A}} + \\frac{1}{N_{D}} \\right) - V_{bi}$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytical expression for the required reverse bias.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**1. Analytical Evaluation ($G_{\\text{closed}}$)**\n\nWe must evaluate the integral for $G$:\n$$ G = 2 \\int_{0}^{x_t} \\kappa(x)\\, dx = 2 \\int_{0}^{E_g/(qF)} \\frac{\\sqrt{2 m_r (E_g - q F x)}}{\\hbar} \\, dx $$\nLet's factor out the constants:\n$$ G = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2 m_r}}{\\hbar} \\int_{0}^{E_g/(qF)} (E_g - q F x)^{1/2} \\, dx $$\nWe use the substitution $u = E_g - qFx$. This implies $du = -qF\\,dx$, or $dx = -\\frac{du}{qF}$. We must also transform the limits of integration:\n- When $x = 0$, $u = E_g - qF(0) = E_g$.\n- When $x = x_t = E_g/(qF)$, $u = E_g - qF(E_g/(qF)) = E_g - E_g = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral gives:\n$$ G = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2 m_r}}{\\hbar} \\int_{E_g}^{0} u^{1/2} \\left(-\\frac{du}{qF}\\right) $$\nWe can absorb the negative sign by swapping the integration limits:\n$$ G = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2 m_r}}{qF\\hbar} \\int_{0}^{E_g} u^{1/2} \\, du $$\nThe integral of $u^{1/2}$ is $\\frac{2}{3}u^{3/2}$. Evaluating the definite integral:\n$$ G = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2 m_r}}{qF\\hbar} \\left[ \\frac{2}{3}u^{3/2} \\right]_{0}^{E_g} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2 m_r}}{qF\\hbar} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}E_g^{3/2} - 0\\right) $$\nThis yields the closed-form expression, known as the Kane triangular-barrier action:\n$$ G_{\\text{closed}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2 m_r}}{3qF\\hbar} E_g^{3/2} $$\n\n**2. Numerical Evaluation ($G_{\\text{num}}$)**\n\nThe numerical value, $G_{\\text{num}}$, is obtained by directly computing the definite integral using a numerical quadrature routine.\n$$ G_{\\text{num}} = 2 \\int_{0}^{x_t} \\kappa(x)\\, dx $$\nwhere $\\kappa(x)$ and $x_t$ are defined as above. We will implement this using the `scipy.integrate.quad` function, which provides a highly accurate estimate of the integral. The integrand $\\kappa(x)$ is continuous over the integration interval $[0, x_t]$, though its derivative is singular at $x=x_t$. High-quality quadrature routines like `quad` are designed to handle such integrable singularities robustly.\n\n**3. Computation of Relative Difference ($\\delta$)**\n\nFor each test case, the following steps are performed:\n1.  Convert the input parameters ($E_g$ from eV to Joules, $m_r$ from units of $m_0$ to kg) to the SI system.\n2.  Calculate $G_{\\text{closed}}$ using the derived analytical formula. All quantities ($m_r$, $E_g$, $q$, $F$, $\\hbar$) must be in SI units.\n3.  Calculate $G_{\\text{num}}$ by performing the numerical integration of $2\\kappa(x)$ from $x=0$ to $x_t=E_g/(qF)$.\n4.  Compute the absolute relative difference $\\delta = \\left|\\frac{G_{\\text{num}} - G_{\\text{closed}}}{G_{\\text{closed}}}\\right|$. Since numerical quadrature is highly accurate and the analytical form is exact, $\\delta$ is expected to be a very small number, close to the machine precision or the error tolerance of the quadrature algorithm. This serves as a verification of the implementations.\n\nThe final programmatic solution will implement these steps for each provided test case.",

            "solution": "The problem is first validated and found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a solution. The negative temperature coefficient of the breakdown voltage ($V_b$ decreases as $T$ increases) is consistent with the physical mechanism of Zener breakdown, or band-to-band tunneling, which is the dominant breakdown mechanism in degenerately-doped $p^+$-$n^+$ junctions.\n\nThe objective is to compute the normalized temperature coefficient of the breakdown voltage, $\\alpha(T_{0})$, at a temperature $T_{0} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The definition is given as:\n$$\n\\alpha(T_{0}) = \\frac{1}{V_{b}(T_{0})}\\,\\left.\\frac{d V_{b}}{d T}\\right|_{T=T_{0}}\n$$\nThis calculation requires two quantities: the breakdown voltage at $T_{0}$, which is $V_{b}(T_{0})$, and the derivative of the breakdown voltage with respect to temperature evaluated at $T_{0}$, which is $\\left.\\frac{d V_{b}}{d T}\\right|_{T=T_{0}}$.\n\nFirst, we identify the value of the breakdown voltage at $T_{0} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ from the provided experimental data.\nFrom the list of measurements, we have:\n$$\nV_{b}(T_{0}) = V_{b}(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 1.93\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nNext, we must compute the derivative $\\left.\\frac{d V_{b}}{d T}\\right|_{T=T_{0}}$. Since $V_{b}(T)$ is given as a set of discrete data points, and the problem states to assume that $V_{b}(T)$ is locally linear around $T_0$, we can approximate the derivative using a finite difference method. The data points for temperature are uniformly spaced with a step of $\\Delta T = 20\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Given that we need to evaluate the derivative at $T_{0} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, which is a central point in the data set, the most accurate and appropriate approximation is the central difference formula.\n\nThe central difference approximation for the first derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x_0$ is given by:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{df}{dx}\\right|_{x=x_0} \\approx \\frac{f(x_0+h) - f(x_0-h)}{2h}\n$$\nIn our context, the function is $V_b(T)$, the variable is $T$, the point of interest is $T_{0} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and the step size $h$ corresponds to the interval between temperature measurements, $h = \\Delta T = 20\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nApplying this formula, we have:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d V_{b}}{d T}\\right|_{T=T_{0}} \\approx \\frac{V_{b}(T_{0}+h) - V_{b}(T_{0}-h)}{2h} = \\frac{V_{b}(300\\,\\mathrm{K} + 20\\,\\mathrm{K}) - V_{b}(300\\,\\mathrm{K} - 20\\,\\mathrm{K})}{2 \\times 20\\,\\mathrm{K}}\n$$\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d V_{b}}{d T}\\right|_{T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}} \\approx \\frac{V_{b}(320\\,\\mathrm{K}) - V_{b}(280\\,\\mathrm{K})}{40\\,\\mathrm{K}}\n$$\nFrom the provided data, we have $V_{b}(320\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 1.88\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $V_{b}(280\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 1.98\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Substituting these values into the expression:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d V_{b}}{d T}\\right|_{T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}} \\approx \\frac{1.88\\,\\mathrm{V} - 1.98\\,\\mathrm{V}}{40\\,\\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{-0.10\\,\\mathrm{V}}{40\\,\\mathrm{K}} = -0.0025\\,\\mathrm{V/K}\n$$\nNow we have both components needed to calculate $\\alpha(T_{0})$. Substituting the values for $V_{b}(T_{0})$ and the derivative into the definition of $\\alpha(T_{0})$:\n$$\n\\alpha(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx \\frac{1}{1.93\\,\\mathrm{V}} \\times (-0.0025\\,\\mathrm{V/K})\n$$\nPerforming the final calculation:\n$$\n\\alpha(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx -\\frac{0.0025}{1.93}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1} \\approx -0.0012953367875...\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $2$, $9$, and $5$.\n$$\n\\alpha(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx -0.001295\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}\n$$",
