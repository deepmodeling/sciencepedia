            "problem": "A two-dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer channel (specifically molybdenum disulfide) is contacted by titanium to form source and drain contacts in a lateral metal–TMD transistor structure. The device under test has a lithographically defined channel width $W = 10~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and a contact overlap length $t_c = 20~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ on both source and drain, ensuring extended contact coverage. Transmission Line Measurement (TLM) structures are fabricated with three different channel lengths $L$ in the same run: $L_1 = 0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $L_2 = 1.0~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and $L_3 = 2.0~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Two-terminal resistances $R_T$ are measured at low drain bias in the linear regime, and the measurements are repeated at three temperatures $T = 300~\\mathrm{K}$, $250~\\mathrm{K}$, and $200~\\mathrm{K}$, with the following data:\n\n- At $T = 300~\\mathrm{K}$: $R_T(L_1) = 2500~\\Omega$, $R_T(L_2) = 3000~\\Omega$, $R_T(L_3) = 4000~\\Omega$.\n- At $T = 250~\\mathrm{K}$: $R_T(L_1) = 4888~\\Omega$, $R_T(L_2) = 5488~\\Omega$, $R_T(L_3) = 6688~\\Omega$.\n- At $T = 200~\\mathrm{K}$: $R_T(L_1) = 14076~\\Omega$, $R_T(L_2) = 14876~\\Omega$, $R_T(L_3) = 16476~\\Omega$.\n\nAssume that the channel is uniformly doped or electrostatically gated such that the sheet resistance is well-defined and the device operates in the linear regime. The metal–TMD contacts are assumed to be thermionic-emission dominated with negligible tunneling at these temperatures, and the ideality factor is $n = 1$. The contact is sufficiently long relative to the transfer length so that the long-contact limit applies at all three temperatures. Use the following well-tested models and core definitions as your starting point:\n\n- The TLM model expresses the total measured resistance as a sum of contact and channel contributions that are linear in the channel length $L$ for fixed width $W$.\n- The concept of transfer length and its consequence in the long-contact limit connecting the effective contact resistance per unit width to the specific contact resistivity and the sheet resistance.\n- The ideal thermionic emission model for a Schottky contact, which gives the temperature dependence of the small-signal specific contact resistivity via the Richardson formalism and the Boltzmann factor.\n\nTask:\n1. From the $T = 300~\\mathrm{K}$ data, compute the specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$ of the titanium–molybdenum disulfide pair, expressing your final $\\rho_c$ in $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n2. Using the temperature dependence of the specific contact resistivity extracted from the three datasets, determine the Schottky barrier height $\\Phi_B$ for electron injection at the titanium–molybdenum disulfide contact. Express $\\Phi_B$ in electronvolts.\n\nRound both the specific contact resistivity and the Schottky barrier height to four significant figures. The final answer must be given as two numbers: the specific contact resistivity (in $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$) and the Schottky barrier height (in $\\mathrm{eV}$).",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data are provided, and the physical models referenced are standard in semiconductor device physics. The provided numerical data are internally consistent and allow for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis based on Transmission Line Measurement (TLM) data from a MoS₂-channel transistor. First, we determine the specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$ at $T=300~\\mathrm{K}$. Second, we use the temperature-dependent data to find the Schottky barrier height $\\Phi_B$ at the Ti/MoS₂ interface.\n\nThe total two-terminal resistance $R_T$ in a TLM structure is modeled as a linear function of the channel length $L$:\n$$R_T(L) = R_{ch} + 2R_c = \\frac{R_{sh}}{W} L + 2R_c$$\nHere, $R_{ch}$ is the channel resistance, $R_c$ is the resistance of a single contact (source or drain), $R_{sh}$ is the sheet resistance of the MoS₂ channel in $\\Omega/\\mathrm{sq}$, and $W$ is the channel width. The equation is in the form of a line, $y=mx+b$, where the slope is $m = R_{sh}/W$ and the y-intercept is $b = 2R_c$.\n\nThe contact resistance $R_c$ is related to the specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$ (in $\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2$) and the channel sheet resistance $R_{sh}$ through the transfer length $L_T = \\sqrt{\\rho_c/R_{sh}}$. The problem states that the long-contact limit applies, meaning the physical contact length $t_c$ is much greater than the transfer length $L_T$. In this limit, the contact resistance is given by:\n$$R_c = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho_c R_{sh}}}{W}$$\nThis allows us to write the intercept as $2R_c = 2\\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho_c R_{sh}}}{W}$. By solving these equations, we can extract $\\rho_c$.\n\n**Part 1: Specific Contact Resistivity at $T = 300~\\mathrm{K}$**\n\nFirst, we analyze the data at $T = 300~\\mathrm{K}$:\n- $R_T(L_1=0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 2500~\\Omega$\n- $R_T(L_2=1.0~\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 3000~\\Omega$\n- $R_T(L_3=2.0~\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 4000~\\Omega$\n\nThe slope of the $R_T$ vs. $L$ plot is:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta R_T}{\\Delta L} = \\frac{3000~\\Omega - 2500~\\Omega}{1.0~\\mu\\mathrm{m} - 0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{500~\\Omega}{0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 1000~\\frac{\\Omega}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 10^9~\\frac{\\Omega}{\\mathrm{m}}$$\nThe channel width is given as $W = 10~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}$. We can now find the sheet resistance $R_{sh}$:\n$$R_{sh} = m \\cdot W = \\left(10^9~\\frac{\\Omega}{\\mathrm{m}}\\right) \\cdot (10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}) = 10^4~\\Omega/\\mathrm{sq}$$\nNext, we find the y-intercept $2R_c$ by extrapolating the linear relation to $L=0$:\n$$2R_c = R_T(L) - m L = 2500~\\Omega - \\left(1000~\\frac{\\Omega}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}\\right)(0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 2500~\\Omega - 500~\\Omega = 2000~\\Omega$$\nThus, the resistance of a single contact is $R_c = 1000~\\Omega$.\n\nNow we can determine the specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$ using the long-contact relation. First, we rearrange the formula for $R_c$ to solve for $\\rho_c$:\n$$R_c W = \\sqrt{\\rho_c R_{sh}} \\implies (R_c W)^2 = \\rho_c R_{sh} \\implies \\rho_c = \\frac{(R_c W)^2}{R_{sh}}$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$\\rho_c = \\frac{((1000~\\Omega)(10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}))^2}{10^4~\\Omega} = \\frac{(10^{-2}~\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m})^2}{10^4~\\Omega} = \\frac{10^{-4}~\\Omega^2\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2}{10^4~\\Omega} = 10^{-8}~\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$$\nThe problem asks for the result in $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$. We use the conversion $1~\\mathrm{m}^2 = 10^4~\\mathrm{cm}^2$:\n$$\\rho_c = 10^{-8}~\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{10^4~\\mathrm{cm}^2}{1~\\mathrm{m}^2}\\right) = 10^{-4}~\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the first answer is $1.000 \\times 10^{-4}~\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n\n**Part 2: Schottky Barrier Height $\\Phi_B$**\n\nTo find the Schottky barrier height, we must analyze the temperature dependence of $\\rho_c$. We repeat the above calculation for the other two temperatures.\n\nFor $T = 250~\\mathrm{K}$:\n$m = \\frac{5488~\\Omega - 4888~\\Omega}{1.0~\\mu\\mathrm{m} - 0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 1200~\\frac{\\Omega}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 1.2 \\times 10^9~\\frac{\\Omega}{\\mathrm{m}}$\n$R_{sh} = m W = (1.2 \\times 10^9~\\Omega/\\mathrm{m}) (10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}) = 1.2 \\times 10^4~\\Omega/\\mathrm{sq}$\n$2R_c = 5488~\\Omega - (1200~\\Omega/\\mu\\mathrm{m})(1.0~\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 4288~\\Omega \\implies R_c = 2144~\\Omega$\n$\\rho_c = \\frac{((2144~\\Omega)(10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}))^2}{1.2 \\times 10^4~\\Omega} = \\frac{(2.144 \\times 10^{-2})^2}{1.2 \\times 10^4} \\approx 3.8306 \\times 10^{-8}~\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$\n\nFor $T = 200~\\mathrm{K}$:\n$m = \\frac{14876~\\Omega - 14076~\\Omega}{1.0~\\mu\\mathrm{m} - 0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 1600~\\frac{\\Omega}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 1.6 \\times 10^9~\\frac{\\Omega}{\\mathrm{m}}$\n$R_{sh} = m W = (1.6 \\times 10^9~\\Omega/\\mathrm{m}) (10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}) = 1.6 \\times 10^4~\\Omega/\\mathrm{sq}$\n$2R_c = 14876~\\Omega - (1600~\\Omega/\\mu\\mathrm{m})(1.0~\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 13276~\\Omega \\implies R_c = 6638~\\Omega$\n$\\rho_c = \\frac{((6638~\\Omega)(10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}))^2}{1.6 \\times 10^4~\\Omega} = \\frac{(6.638 \\times 10^{-2})^2}{1.6 \\times 10^4} \\approx 2.7539 \\times 10^{-7}~\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$\n\nThe specific contact resistivity for a thermionic-emission-dominated Schottky contact is given by:\n$$\\rho_c(T) = \\left(\\frac{dJ}{dV}\\right)^{-1}_{V=0} = \\frac{nk_B T}{e J_0}$$\nwhere $J_0 = A^{**} T^2 \\exp(-\\frac{e\\Phi_B}{k_B T})$ is the reverse saturation current density, $n$ is the ideality factor, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $e$ is the elementary charge. With $n=1$, we get:\n$$\\rho_c(T) = \\frac{k_B T}{e A^{**} T^2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\Phi_B}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{k_B}{e A^{**} T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\Phi_B}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nTo extract $\\Phi_B$, we linearize this equation by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$\\ln(\\rho_c) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B}{e A^{**}}\\right) - \\ln(T) + \\frac{e\\Phi_B}{k_B T}$$\n$$\\ln(\\rho_c T) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B}{e A^{**}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{e\\Phi_B}{k_B}\\right)\\frac{1}{T}$$\nThis shows that a plot of $\\ln(\\rho_c T)$ versus $1/T$ should yield a straight line with slope $m' = \\frac{e\\Phi_B}{k_B}$.\n\nLet's compute the data points $(x,y) = (1/T, \\ln(\\rho_c T))$ in SI units:\n- $T_1 = 300~\\mathrm{K}$: $x_1 = 1/300~\\mathrm{K}^{-1} \\approx 0.003333~\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $y_1 = \\ln(10^{-8} \\times 300) = \\ln(3 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx -12.7155$\n- $T_2 = 250~\\mathrm{K}$: $x_2 = 1/250~\\mathrm{K}^{-1} = 0.004~\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $y_2 = \\ln(3.8306 \\times 10^{-8} \\times 250) = \\ln(9.5765 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx -11.5554$\n- $T_3 = 200~\\mathrm{K}$: $x_3 = 1/200~\\mathrm{K}^{-1} = 0.005~\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $y_3 = \\ln(2.7539 \\times 10^{-7} \\times 200) = \\ln(5.5078 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx -9.8071$\n\nWe perform a linear regression on these three points to find the slope $m'$. Since the data is nearly perfectly collinear, we can calculate the slope between the endpoints for a good estimate:\n$$m' \\approx \\frac{y_3 - y_1}{x_3 - x_1} = \\frac{-9.8071 - (-12.7155)}{0.005 - 1/300} = \\frac{2.9084}{0.001666...} \\approx 1745.0~\\mathrm{K}$$\nA formal linear regression for the three points yields a slope of $m' \\approx 1745.3~\\mathrm{K}$. We use this more precise value.\n\nFrom the slope, we find the Schottky barrier height $\\Phi_B$:\n$$\\Phi_B = m' \\cdot \\frac{k_B}{e}$$\nUsing the value of the constant $\\frac{k_B}{e} \\approx 8.617333 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{eV/K}$:\n$$\\Phi_B = (1745.3~\\mathrm{K}) \\cdot (8.617333 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\approx 0.15040~\\mathrm{eV}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the Schottky barrier height is $0.1504~\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nThe final answers are the specific contact resistivity at $T=300~\\mathrm{K}$ and the Schottky barrier height.\n$\\rho_c(300~\\mathrm{K}) = 1.000 \\times 10^{-4}~\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$\n$\\Phi_B = 0.1504~\\mathrm{eV}$",

We can express this by equating the capacitance per unit area for both materials:\n$$C'_{\\mathrm{HfO}_2} = C'_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2, \\text{equiv}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for capacitance:\n$$\\frac{k_{ox} \\varepsilon_{0}}{t_{ox}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2} \\varepsilon_{0}}{\\text{EOT}}$$\nHere, $k_{ox}$ and $t_{ox}$ are the relative dielectric constant and thickness of $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$, and $k_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2}$ is the relative dielectric constant of $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$. Solving for EOT:\n$$\\text{EOT} = t_{ox} \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2}}{k_{ox}}$$\nWe are given the following values:\n- Physical thickness of $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$, $t_{ox} = 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n- Relative dielectric constant of $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$, $k_{ox} = 20$\n- Relative dielectric constant of $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$, $k_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2} = 3.9$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for EOT:\n$$\\text{EOT} = (3.0 \\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\frac{3.9}{20} = 3.0 \\times 0.195 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 0.585 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\nThe Effective Oxide Thickness is $0.585 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nTask 2: Gate Leakage Current Calculation\n\nFirst, we determine the electric field across the oxide, $E_{ox}$. Assuming the gate voltage $V_g$ drops entirely across the oxide of thickness $t_{ox}$:\n$$E_{ox} = \\frac{V_g}{t_{ox}}$$\nGiven $V_{g} = 1.0 \\ \\mathrm{V}$ and $t_{ox} = 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n$$E_{ox} = \\frac{1.0 \\ \\mathrm{V}}{3.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{9} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 3.333 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{m}}$$\nThe gate leakage is modeled by Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling. The FN current density, $J$, as a function of the electric field $E_{ox}$ is given by:\n$$J = A E_{ox}^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B}{E_{ox}}\\right)$$\nThe coefficients $A$ and $B$, derived from the WKB approximation for a triangular barrier, are:\n$$A = \\frac{q^3}{16 \\pi^2 \\hbar \\phi_B}$$\n$$B = \\frac{4 \\sqrt{2m^{\\ast}} \\phi_B^{3/2}}{3 q \\hbar}$$\nHere, $q$ is the elementary charge, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $m^{\\ast}$ is the electron effective mass in the oxide, and $\\phi_B$ is the barrier height energy.\n\nLet's compute the constants $A$ and $B$ using the provided values in SI units:\n- $q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}$\n- $\\hbar = 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot s}$\n- $\\phi_B = 2.0 \\ \\mathrm{eV} = 2.0 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{J} = 3.204 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{J}$\n- $m^{\\ast} = 0.20 \\ m_{0} = 0.20 \\times (9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{kg}) = 1.822 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n\nFirst, we compute the coefficient $B$:\n$$B = \\frac{4 \\sqrt{2(1.822 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{kg})} (3.204 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{J})^{3/2}}{3 (1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}) (1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot s})}$$\n$$B = \\frac{4 \\sqrt{3.644 \\times 10^{-31}} (5.733 \\times 10^{-29})}{5.065 \\times 10^{-53}} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{4 (6.036 \\times 10^{-16}) (5.733 \\times 10^{-29})}{5.065 \\times 10^{-53}} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{m}}$$\n$$B = \\frac{1.384 \\times 10^{-43}}{5.065 \\times 10^{-53}} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 2.732 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{m}}$$\nThere seems to be a subtlety in the standard form of the coefficient $B$. Let's re-derive it in a way that connects to common textbook constants, using $\\phi_{B,eV}$ for the barrier height in electron-volts: $\\phi_B = q \\phi_{B,eV}$. The expression for B becomes $B = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2m^*q}}{3\\hbar}(\\phi_{B,eV})^{3/2}$.\n$$B = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2(1.822 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{kg})(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C})}}{3(1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot s})} (2.0)^{3/2} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{m}}$$\n$$B = \\frac{4(2.416 \\times 10^{-25})}{3.162 \\times 10^{-34}} (2.828) \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{m}} = (3.056 \\times 10^9)(2.828) \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 8.644 \\times 10^9 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{m}}$$\nThis second derivation is more robust against common pitfalls with units. We proceed with this value.\n\nNext, we compute the coefficient $A$:\n$$A = \\frac{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C})^3}{16 \\pi^2 (1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot s}) (3.204 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{J})} = \\frac{4.111 \\times 10^{-57}}{5.333 \\times 10^{-51}} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{V}^2}$$\n$$A \\approx 7.709 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{V}^2}$$\nNow we compute the current density $J$ with $E_{ox} = 3.333 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{V/m}$:\n$$J = (7.709 \\times 10^{-7}) (3.333 \\times 10^8)^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{8.644 \\times 10^9}{3.333 \\times 10^8}\\right)$$\n$$J = (7.709 \\times 10^{-7}) (1.111 \\times 10^{17}) \\exp(-25.93)$$\n$$J = (8.566 \\times 10^{10}) (5.47 \\times 10^{-12}) \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{m}^2} \\approx 0.468 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{m}^2}$$\nThe total gate leakage current $I_{gate}$ is $J$ multiplied by the device area $A$:\n$$A = W \\times L = (1.0 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\times (0.50 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 0.50 \\ (\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2 = 0.50 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2$$\n$$I_{gate} = J \\cdot A = (0.468 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{m}^2}) (0.50 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2) \\approx 2.34 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{A}$$\nThe total gate leakage current is approximately $2.34 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{A}$.\n\nTask 3: Reliability Margin Factor Calculation\n\nThe reliability margin factor $M$ is defined as the minimum of two ratios: the breakdown field margin and the leakage current margin.\n$$M = \\min\\!\\left( \\frac{E_{bd}}{E_{ox}}, \\frac{J_{lim}}{J} \\right)$$\nWe have the following values:\n- Breakdown field for $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$, $E_{bd} = 8.0 \\ \\mathrm{MV/cm} = 8.0 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{V} / (10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{m}) = 8.0 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{V/m}$.\n- Oxide electric field, $E_{ox} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{9} \\ \\mathrm{V/m}$.\n- Reliability leakage density limit, $J_{lim} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{A/m}^{2}$.\n- Calculated leakage current density, $J \\approx 0.468 \\ \\mathrm{A/m}^{2}$.\n\nLet's compute the two ratios:\nThe breakdown margin is:\n$$\\frac{E_{bd}}{E_{ox}} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{V/m}}{\\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{9} \\ \\mathrm{V/m}} = \\frac{8.0}{10/3} = 2.4$$\nThe leakage margin is:\n$$\\frac{J_{lim}}{J} = \\frac{10 \\ \\mathrm{A/m}^{2}}{0.468 \\ \\mathrm{A/m}^{2}} \\approx 21.37$$\nThe reliability margin factor $M$ is the minimum of these two values:\n$$M = \\min(2.4, 21.37) = 2.4$$\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$M \\approx 2.40$$",
