The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous technical language. All variables are explicitly defined. The task is a quantitative derivation, free of subjectivity or opinion. The problem is objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe system consists of the intrinsic TFET device in series with the source contact resistance $R_{c}$. The total applied voltage is $V_{DS,\\mathrm{app}}$. Let $I_{on,\\mathrm{m}}$ be the measured current flowing through the circuit. This current flows through both the contact resistance $R_{c}$ and the intrinsic TFET.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), the applied voltage $V_{DS,\\mathrm{app}}$ is distributed between the voltage drop across the source contact resistance, $V_{R_c}$, and the intrinsic voltage across the TFET channel, $V_{DS,\\mathrm{int}}$.\n$$\nV_{DS,\\mathrm{app}} = V_{R_c} + V_{DS,\\mathrm{int}}\n$$\nThe voltage drop across the resistor $R_{c}$ is given by Ohm's law:\n$$\nV_{R_c} = I_{on,\\mathrm{m}} R_{c}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the KVL equation, we can express the intrinsic voltage across the TFET in terms of the applied voltage and the measured current:\n$$\nV_{DS,\\mathrm{int}} = V_{DS,\\mathrm{app}} - I_{on,\\mathrm{m}} R_{c}\n$$\nThe current through the intrinsic TFET is a function of the intrinsic voltage across it, which we denote as $I(V_{DS,\\mathrm{int}})$. Therefore, the measured current $I_{on,\\mathrm{m}}$ must satisfy the self-consistent equation:\n$$\nI_{on,\\mathrm{m}} = I(V_{DS,\\mathrm{int}}) = I(V_{DS,\\mathrm{app}} - I_{on,\\mathrm{m}} R_{c})\n$$\nThe problem specifies a small-signal linearization about the operating point defined by $V_{DS,\\mathrm{app}}$. We can perform a first-order Taylor series expansion of the function $I(V)$ around the voltage $V_{DS,\\mathrm{app}}$. For a voltage $V = V_{DS,\\mathrm{app}} + \\Delta V$, the current is approximately:\n$$\nI(V) \\approx I(V_{DS,\\mathrm{app}}) + \\left. \\frac{dI}{dV} \\right|_{V=V_{DS,\\mathrm{app}}} \\Delta V\n$$\nIn our case, the argument is $V_{DS,\\mathrm{int}} = V_{DS,\\mathrm{app}} - I_{on,\\mathrm{m}} R_{c}$, so the voltage deviation from the reference point $V_{DS,\\mathrm{app}}$ is $\\Delta V = -I_{on,\\mathrm{m}} R_{c}$.\n\nBy definition, the intrinsic current without contact resistance is $I_{on,0} = I(V_{DS,\\mathrm{app}})$, and the small-signal tunneling conductance is $G_{t} = \\left. \\frac{dI}{dV} \\right|_{V=V_{DS,\\mathrm{app}}}$. Substituting these definitions and the expression for $\\Delta V$ into the Taylor expansion, we obtain the linearized self-consistent equation for $I_{on,\\mathrm{m}}$:\n$$\nI_{on,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx I_{on,0} + G_{t} (-I_{on,\\mathrm{m}} R_{c})\n$$\n$$\nI_{on,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx I_{on,0} - I_{on,\\mathrm{m}} G_{t} R_{c}\n$$\nWe now solve this algebraic equation for $I_{on,\\mathrm{m}}$:\n$$\nI_{on,\\mathrm{m}} + I_{on,\\mathrm{m}} G_{t} R_{c} = I_{on,0}\n$$\n$$\nI_{on,\\mathrm{m}} (1 + G_{t} R_{c}) = I_{on,0}\n$$\n$$\nI_{on,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{I_{on,0}}{1 + G_{t} R_{c}}\n$$\nThis expression relates the measured on-current to the intrinsic on-current and the circuit parameters $G_t$ and $R_c$.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the fractional reduction in the on-current, $f$, as defined in the problem statement:\n$$\nf = \\frac{I_{on,0} - I_{on,\\mathrm{m}}}{I_{on,0}} = 1 - \\frac{I_{on,\\mathrm{m}}}{I_{on,0}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{on,\\mathrm{m}}$:\n$$\nf = 1 - \\frac{1}{I_{on,0}} \\left( \\frac{I_{on,0}}{1 + G_{t} R_{c}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nf = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + G_{t} R_{c}}\n$$\nCombining the terms into a single fraction:\n$$\nf = \\frac{(1 + G_{t} R_{c}) - 1}{1 + G_{t} R_{c}}\n$$\n$$\nf = \\frac{G_{t} R_{c}}{1 + G_{t} R_{c}}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the fractional reduction in current due to the source contact resistance, expressed solely in terms of the given parameters $G_t$ and $R_c$. The product $G_t R_c$ is a dimensionless quantity, as expected, since $G_t$ has units of siemens (A/V) and $R_c$ has units of ohms (V/A).",

In an n-type TFET, normal operation (the n-branch) occurs for $V_G > 0$ and $V_D > 0$, where electrons tunnel from the source valence band to the channel conduction band at the source-channel junction. The gate voltage $V_G$ primarily controls this tunneling barrier. An increase in $V_D$ slightly degrades the gate's control due to drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), causing a modest increase in $S$, which we observe as $\\Delta S_{\\text{n}} = 10~\\mathrm{mV/dec}$.\n\nAmbipolar conduction (the p-branch) occurs for $V_G  0$ and $V_D > 0$. Under this bias, the bands are pushed up, and electrons can tunnel from the channel valence band into the empty states in the drain conduction band. The tunneling junction is now at the channel-drain interface. In this configuration, the drain voltage $V_D$ has a much more direct and significant impact on the tunneling window width. A larger $V_D$ greatly enhances the conditions for this parasitic tunneling, effectively reducing the relative control of the gate over the current. Consequently, a larger change in $V_G$ is needed to modulate the current, leading to a much higher subthreshold swing. The strong dependence of this parasitic tunneling on $V_D$ explains the anomalously large degradation $\\Delta S_{\\text{p}} = 50~\\mathrm{mV/dec}$, which is five times larger than $\\Delta S_{\\text{n}}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the ambipolarity index $A$:\n$$A = \\frac{\\Delta S_{\\text{p}} - \\Delta S_{\\text{n}}}{\\Delta S_{\\text{n}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$A = \\frac{50~\\mathrm{mV/dec} - 10~\\mathrm{mV/dec}}{10~\\mathrm{mV/dec}} = \\frac{40}{10} = 4$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The key fixed parameters are:\nSupply voltage $V_{DD} = 0.6 \\ \\mathrm{V}$\nThreshold voltage $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.2 \\ \\mathrm{V}$\nLoad capacitance $C_L = 1.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{F}$\nBase tunneling length $\\lambda_0 = 5.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\nSource geometry factor $\\eta_s = 0.1$\nDrain geometry factor $\\eta_d = 1.0$\nBTBT prefactor $K = 5.0 \\times 10^{-21}$ (in appropriate SI units to yield amperes)\nField coefficient $B_0 = 5.0 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\mathrm{V/m}$ per $\\mathrm{eV}^{3/2}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the effective voltages, which are constant for all test cases. The source-side effective voltage for the on-state is:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{eff},s} = \\max(V_{DD} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}, 0) = \\max(0.6 - 0.2, 0) = 0.4 \\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nThe drain-side effective voltage for the ambipolar off-state is:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{eff},d} = V_{DD} = 0.6 \\ \\mathrm{V} $$\n\nFor any given test case defined by a pair $(E_g, L_{\\mathrm{und}})$, the calculation follows these steps:\n\n1.  Convert $L_{\\mathrm{und}}$ from nanometers to meters: $L_{\\mathrm{und,m}} = L_{\\mathrm{und,nm}} \\times 10^{-9}$.\n\n2.  Calculate the effective tunneling lengths for the source-side ($\\lambda_s$) and drain-side ($\\lambda_d$) junctions:\n    $$ \\lambda_s = \\lambda_0 + \\eta_s L_{\\mathrm{und,m}} $$\n    $$ \\lambda_d = \\lambda_0 + \\eta_d L_{\\mathrm{und,m}} $$\n\n3.  Calculate the effective electric fields at these junctions:\n    $$ E_s = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{eff},s}}{\\lambda_s} $$\n    $$ E_d = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{eff},d}}{\\lambda_d} $$\n\n4.  Calculate the on-state current ($I_{\\mathrm{on}}$) and ambipolar leakage current ($I_{\\mathrm{amb}}$) using the BTBT model. The bandgap $E_g$ is given in $\\mathrm{eV}$ and is used as such in the formula:\n    $$ I_{\\mathrm{on}} = K \\, E_s^2 \\, \\exp\\left(- B_0 \\frac{E_g^{3/2}}{E_s}\\right) $$\n    $$ I_{\\mathrm{amb}} = K \\, E_d^2 \\, \\exp\\left(- B_0 \\frac{E_g^{3/2}}{E_d}\\right) $$\n\n5.  Calculate the inverter's propagation delay ($t_{\\mathrm{pd}}$):\n    $$ t_{\\mathrm{pd}} = \\frac{C_L V_{DD}}{I_{\\mathrm{on}}} $$\n\n6.  Calculate the dynamic energy ($E_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$) and leakage energy ($E_{\\mathrm{leak}}$) per switching transition. Note that $E_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$ is constant for all cases:\n    $$ E_{\\mathrm{dyn}} = C_L V_{DD}^2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{F})(0.6 \\ \\mathrm{V})^2 = 3.6 \\times 10^{-16} \\ \\mathrm{J} $$\n    $$ E_{\\mathrm{leak}} = V_{DD} \\, I_{\\mathrm{amb}} \\, t_{\\mathrm{pd}} $$\n\n7.  Calculate the total energy-delay product ($\\mathrm{EDP}$):\n    $$ \\mathrm{EDP} = (E_{\\mathrm{dyn}} + E_{\\mathrm{leak}}) t_{\\mathrm{pd}} $$\n\nThis procedure is applied to each test case.\n\nLet's compute the $\\mathrm{EDP}$ for the baseline case: ($E_g = 0.6 \\ \\mathrm{eV}, L_{\\mathrm{und}} = 5 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$).\n$L_{\\mathrm{und,m}} = 5 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$\\lambda_s = 5 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{m} + 0.1 \\times (5 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}) = 1 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$\\lambda_d = 5 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{m} + 1.0 \\times (5 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}) = 5.5 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$E_s = 0.4 \\ \\mathrm{V} / (1 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}) = 4 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{V/m}$\n$E_d = 0.6 \\ \\mathrm{V} / (5.5 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}) \\approx 1.0909 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{V/m}$\n$E_g^{3/2} = (0.6)^{1.5} \\approx 0.46476 \\ \\mathrm{eV}^{3/2}$\n$I_{\\mathrm{on}} = (5 \\times 10^{-21}) (4 \\times 10^8)^2 \\exp\\left(- (5 \\times 10^8) \\frac{0.46476}{4 \\times 10^8}\\right) \\approx 4.4746 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{A}$\n$I_{\\mathrm{amb}} = (5 \\times 10^{-21}) (1.0909 \\times 10^8)^2 \\exp\\left(- (5 \\times 10^8) \\frac{0.46476}{1.0909 \\times 10^8}\\right) \\approx 7.0505 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{A}$\n$t_{\\mathrm{pd}} = \\frac{(10^{-15})(0.6)}{4.4746 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 1.3409 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{s}$\n$E_{\\mathrm{leak}} = (0.6)(7.0505 \\times 10^{-6})(1.3409 \\times 10^{-12}) \\approx 5.676 \\times 10^{-18} \\ \\mathrm{J}$\n$\\mathrm{EDP}_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = (3.6 \\times 10^{-16} + 5.676 \\times 10^{-18}) \\times 1.3409 \\times 10^{-12} \\approx 4.9025 \\times 10^{-28} \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot s}$\n\nThis value, $\\mathrm{EDP}_{\\mathrm{baseline}}$, serves as the reference. The same calculation is performed for the remaining four test cases:\n2.  Edge: $(E_g = 0.4 \\ \\mathrm{eV}, L_{\\mathrm{und}} = 0 \\ \\mathrm{nm})$\n3.  High bandgap: $(E_g = 0.9 \\ \\mathrm{eV}, L_{\\mathrm{und}} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{nm})$\n4.  Long underlap: $(E_g = 0.6 \\ \\mathrm{eV}, L_{\\mathrm{und}} = 15 \\ \\mathrm{nm})$\n5.  Moderate: $(E_g = 0.7 \\ \\mathrm{eV}, L_{\\mathrm{und}} = 8 \\ \\mathrm{nm})$\n\nAfter computing the $\\mathrm{EDP}$ for each case, the improvement factor, $I$, is calculated as:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{case}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{EDP}_{\\mathrm{baseline}}}{\\mathrm{EDP}_{\\mathrm{case}}} $$\nFor the baseline case itself, $I_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = \\mathrm{EDP}_{\\mathrm{baseline}}/\\mathrm{EDP}_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = 1.0$.\n\nThe computed improvement factors for all five cases, in order, are:\n1.  Baseline: $I_1 = 1.000000$ (by definition)\n2.  Edge: $I_2 \\approx 1.258759$\n3.  High bandgap and moderate underlap: $I_3 \\approx 0.000020$\n4.  Long underlap: $I_4 \\approx 0.280140$\n5.  Moderate bandgap and underlap: $I_5 \\approx 0.129337$\n\nThe results show that the \"Edge\" case with a low bandgap and zero underlap offers a performance improvement over the baseline, primarily due to a significantly higher on-current leading to a much smaller delay, which dominates the EDP calculation despite increased leakage. Conversely, cases with higher bandgaps or longer underlaps result in much poorer EDP (improvement factor $ 1$) because the reduction in on-current drastically increases the propagation delay, overwhelming any benefits from reduced leakage.",
