A Bravais lattice is an infinite array of discrete points with an arrangement and orientation that appears exactly the same, from whichever of the points the array is viewed. Any such lattice point can be reached from an origin point by a translation vector $\\mathbf{R}$ of the form:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R} = n_1 \\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \\mathbf{a}_2 + n_3 \\mathbf{a}_3\n$$\nwhere $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$ are any integers, and $\\mathbf{a}_1$, $\\mathbf{a}_2$, $\\mathbf{a}_3$ are the primitive vectors, which must be linearly independent.\n\nThe parallelepiped defined by the primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}_1$, $\\mathbf{a}_2$, and $\\mathbf{a}_3$ is called the primitive cell.

            "solution": "The problem requires the construction of primitive lattice vectors for the body-centered cubic (bcc) and face-centered cubic (fcc) Bravais lattices, starting from their description in a conventional cubic cell of side length $a$. From these vectors, the volume of the primitive unit cell, $V_{\\text{prim}}$, is to be calculated and expressed as a fraction of the conventional cell volume, $a^3$. Finally, this result must be verified by counting the number of lattice points within the conventional cell.\n\nA Bravais lattice is an infinite array of discrete points with an arrangement and orientation that appears exactly the same from whichever of the points the array is viewed. Any lattice point can be reached from any other by a translation vector of the form $\\boldsymbol{R} = n_1 \\boldsymbol{a}_1 + n_2 \\boldsymbol{a}_2 + n_3 \\boldsymbol{a}_3$, where $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are integers and $\\{\\boldsymbol{a}_1, \\boldsymbol{a}_2, \\boldsymbol{a}_3\\}$ is a set of linearly independent primitive lattice vectors. The volume of the primitive cell, which is a minimum-volume cell containing exactly one lattice point, is given by the scalar triple product $V_{\\text{prim}} = |\\boldsymbol{a}_1 \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{a}_2 \\times \\boldsymbol{a}_3)|$.\n\nLet the conventional cubic cell be defined by an origin at one corner and spanned by the orthonormal Cartesian basis $\\{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}\\}$, with edges of length $a$ aligned with these axes.\n\n**1. Body-Centered Cubic (bcc) Lattice**\n\nA bcc lattice is formed by placing lattice points at the corners of a conventional cubic cell and one additional point at the center of the cube. The coordinates of the corner points are $(ia, ja, ka)$ for integers $i, j, k$, and the body-centered points are located at positions displaced by $\\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}})$ from each corner point.\n\nTo construct the primitive vectors, we select three linearly independent vectors that connect a chosen lattice point (the origin) to other lattice points, such that integer linear combinations of these vectors generate all lattice points and only lattice points. A common and valid choice for the bcc primitive vectors connects the lattice point at the origin to the body centers of three adjacent conventional cells. However, a more symmetric choice connects the origin point to three of its eight nearest neighbors, which are the body-centered points. Let us choose the following set of vectors:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{bcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{bcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{bcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) $$\nTo justify this choice, we must show that these vectors generate the entire bcc lattice. For example, the vector to the nearest corner point along the $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ axis, $a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$, can be formed by the sum $\\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{bcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{bcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) = a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$. Similarly, $a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} = \\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{bcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{bcc}}$ and $a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} = \\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{bcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{bcc}}$. This confirms that all corner points of the infinite cubic lattice can be generated. The vector to the body center of the cell at the origin is $\\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) = \\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{bcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{bcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{bcc}}$. This shows that the body-center points are also generated. This set of vectors thus correctly spans the bcc lattice.\n\nThe volume of the bcc primitive cell, $V_{\\text{prim,bcc}}$, is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of these vectors:\n$$ V_{\\text{prim,bcc}} = |\\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{bcc}} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{bcc}} \\times \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{bcc}})| = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -a/2 & a/2 & a/2 \\\\ a/2 & -a/2 & a/2 \\\\ a/2 & a/2 & -a/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| $$\n$$ V_{\\text{prim,bcc}} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3 \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |(-1)(1-1) - 1(-1-1) + 1(1-(-1))| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |0 + 2 + 2| = \\frac{4a^3}{8} = \\frac{a^3}{2} $$\nThe dimensionless fraction of the conventional cell volume $a^3$ is:\n$$ \\frac{V_{\\text{prim,bcc}}}{a^3} = \\frac{a^3/2}{a^3} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nTo verify this, we count the number of lattice points per conventional bcc cell. There are $8$ corner points, each shared by $8$ adjacent cells, contributing $8 \\times (1/8) = 1$ lattice point. There is $1$ body-centered point entirely within the cell, contributing $1$ lattice point. The total is $1+1=2$ lattice points per conventional cell. The volume per lattice point is therefore $V_{\\text{conv}}/2 = a^3/2$, which matches our derived $V_{\\text{prim,bcc}}$.\n\n**2. Face-Centered Cubic (fcc) Lattice**\n\nAn fcc lattice is formed by placing lattice points at the corners of a conventional cubic cell and at the center of each of its six faces.\n\nA convenient set of primitive vectors connects the lattice point at the origin to the centers of the three faces that meet at that origin:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{fcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{fcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{fcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}) $$\nTo justify this choice, we verify that these vectors can generate the lattice. The vector to the nearest corner point along the $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ axis is given by $\\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{fcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{fcc}} - \\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{fcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}+\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}+\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} - (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}+\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}})) = a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$. Symmetrical combinations generate $a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$ and $a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$. Thus, all corner points are generated. The face-centered points are generated directly by the primitive vectors themselves (for the three faces meeting at the origin) and by sums like $\\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{fcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{fcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + 2\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) = a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} + \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}})$, which represents the center of the face on the $xy$-plane of the adjacent cell along $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$. The set is therefore a valid basis for the fcc lattice.\n\nThe volume of the fcc primitive cell, $V_{\\text{prim,fcc}}$, is:\n$$ V_{\\text{prim,fcc}} = |\\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{fcc}} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{fcc}} \\times \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{fcc}})| = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & a/2 & a/2 \\\\ a/2 & 0 & a/2 \\\\ a/2 & a/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| $$\n$$ V_{\\text{prim,fcc}} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3 \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |0(0-1) - 1(0-1) + 1(1-0)| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |0 + 1 + 1| = \\frac{2a^3}{8} = \\frac{a^3}{4} $$\nThe dimensionless fraction of the conventional cell volume $a^3$ is:\n$$ \\frac{V_{\\text{prim,fcc}}}{a^3} = \\frac{a^3/4}{a^3} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nTo verify this, we count the lattice points per conventional fcc cell. There are $8$ corners, contributing $8 \\times (1/8) = 1$ lattice point. There are $6$ face centers, each shared by $2$ adjacent cells, contributing $6 \\times (1/2) = 3$ lattice points. The total is $1+3=4$ lattice points per conventional cell. The volume per lattice point is therefore $V_{\\text{conv}}/4 = a^3/4$, which matches our derived $V_{\\text{prim,fcc}}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the two dimensionless volume fractions $V_{\\text{prim}}/a^{3}$ in the order (bcc, fcc).\nFor bcc, the fraction is $1/2$.\nFor fcc, the fraction is $1/4$.\nThe result is presented as a single row matrix.",
