Computation of Reciprocal Lattice Vectors**\n\nLet the reciprocal lattice vectors be expressed in cartesian coordinates as $\\mathbf{b}_{1} = (b_{1x}, b_{1y})$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{2} = (b_{2x}, b_{2y})$. The defining relation is $\\mathbf{a}_{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}_{j} = 2\\pi\\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nTo find $\\mathbf{b}_1$, we use the conditions $\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1 = 2\\pi$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1 = 0$.\n$$ a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)b_{1x} + a\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)b_{1y} = 2\\pi \\quad (1) $$\n$$ a\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)b_{1x} + a\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)b_{1y} = 0 \\quad (2) $$\nFrom equation (2), we find $b_{1x} = \\sqrt{3} b_{1y}$. Substituting this into equation (1):\n$$ a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(\\sqrt{3}b_{1y}) + a\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)b_{1y} = 2\\pi $$\n$$ a\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}b_{1y} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}b_{1y}\\right) = 2\\pi \\implies a\\sqrt{3}b_{1y} = 2\\pi \\implies b_{1y} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}} $$\nThen, $b_{1x} = \\sqrt{3} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$. So, the first reciprocal lattice vector is:\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\left(1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) $$\n\nTo find $\\mathbf{b}_2$, we use the conditions $\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2 = 0$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2 = 2\\pi$.\n$$ a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)b_{2x} + a\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)b_{2y} = 0 \\quad (3) $$\n$$ a\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)b_{2x} + a\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)b_{2y} = 2\\pi \\quad (4) $$\nFrom equation (3), we find $b_{2x} = -\\sqrt{3} b_{2y}$. Substituting this into equation (4):\n$$ a\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(-\\sqrt{3}b_{2y}) + a\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)b_{2y} = 2\\pi $$\n$$ a\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}b_{2y} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}b_{2y}\\right) = 2\\pi \\implies a\\sqrt{3}b_{2y} = 2\\pi \\implies b_{2y} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}} $$\nThen, $b_{2x} = -\\sqrt{3} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = -\\frac{2\\pi}{a}$. So, the second reciprocal lattice vector is:\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\left(-\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\left(-1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) $$\n\n**2. Determination of High-Symmetry Points K and K'**\n\nThe first Brillouin zone is the Wigner-Seitz cell of the reciprocal lattice centered at the origin ($\\Gamma$ point). Its boundaries are the perpendicular bisectors of the reciprocal lattice vectors connecting the origin to its nearest neighbors. The reciprocal lattice is a triangular lattice. The six shortest non-zero reciprocal lattice vectors are $\\pm\\mathbf{b}_1$, $\\pm\\mathbf{b}_2$, and $\\pm(\\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2)$.\nLet's find $\\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2$:\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\left(1-1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\left(0, \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) $$\nThe squares of the magnitudes are:\n$|\\mathbf{b}_1|^2 = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2(1^2 + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})^2) = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2(1+\\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{4}{3}(\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2$.\n$|\\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2|^2 = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2(0^2 + (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})^2) = \\frac{4}{3}(\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2$.\nAll six vectors have the same magnitude, as expected.\n\nThe corners of the hexagonal Brillouin zone, the K-points, are formed by the intersection of adjacent perpendicular bisector lines. Let's find the intersection of the bisectors of $\\mathbf{b}_1$ and $\\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2$. A point $\\mathbf{k}=(k_x, k_y)$ on a bisector of a vector $\\mathbf{G}$ satisfies $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{G} = \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{G}|^2$.\n\nFor $\\mathbf{G}_A = \\mathbf{b}_1 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}(1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$:\n$$ k_x\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right) + k_y\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 $$\nDividing by $2\\pi/a$ gives:\n$$ k_x + \\frac{k_y}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\quad (5) $$\n\nFor $\\mathbf{G}_B = \\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}(0, \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})$:\n$$ k_y\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ k_y\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^2} \\implies k_y = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^2}\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4\\pi} = \\frac{2\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{3a} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}} $$\nSubstituting this value of $k_y$ into equation (5):\n$$ k_x + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a} $$\n$$ k_x + \\frac{2\\pi}{3a} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a} \\implies k_x = \\frac{2\\pi}{3a} $$\nSo, one high-symmetry corner is $K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3a}, \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$.\n\nThe other inequivalent corner, $K'$, can be found by various symmetry operations. A common choice for the pair $(K, K')$ is to use the two corners lying on the same horizontal line. The other corner on the line $k_y = \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}$ is the intersection of the bisectors of $\\mathbf{G}_B = \\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2$ and $\\mathbf{G}_C = \\mathbf{b}_2$.\nThe bisector for $\\mathbf{G}_C = \\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}(-1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$ is:\n$$ -k_x + \\frac{k_y}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\quad (6) $$\nWe already have $k_y = \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}$ from the bisector of $\\mathbf{G}_B$. Substituting this into equation (6):\n$$ -k_x + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a} $$\n$$ -k_x + \\frac{2\\pi}{3a} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a} \\implies -k_x = \\frac{2\\pi}{3a} \\implies k_x = -\\frac{2\\pi}{3a} $$\nSo, the other inequivalent corner is $K' = \\left(-\\frac{2\\pi}{3a}, \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, we express these coordinates in units of $2\\pi/a$.\nFor $K = (k_x(K), k_y(K))$:\n$$ k_x(K) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3a} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right) $$\n$$ k_y(K) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right) $$\nFor $K' = (k_x(K'), k_y(K'))$:\n$$ k_x(K') = -\\frac{2\\pi}{3a} = -\\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right) $$\n$$ k_y(K') = \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right) $$\nThe dimensionless coordinates requested are ($k_x(K), k_y(K), k_x(K'), k_y(K')$) in units of $2\\pi/a$. These are:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right) $$\n\nThese four numbers are arranged in a row matrix as the final answer.",

The bcc reciprocal lattice can be described relative to a conventional cubic cell of side length $4\\pi/a$.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice points $\\mathbf{G}$ are given by vectors whose components in units of $2\\pi/a$ have integer coordinates $(h,k,l)$ such that their sum $h+k+l$ is an even number. The nearest reciprocal lattice points to the origin $\\Gamma$ are the 12 vectors of the form $\\frac{2\\pi}{a}(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0)$ and its permutations. For example, $\\frac{2\\pi}{a}(1, 1, 0)$, $\\frac{2\\pi}{a}(1, -1, 0)$, $\\frac{2\\pi}{a}(1, 0, 1)$, etc. The squared magnitude of these vectors is $|\\mathbf{G}|^2 = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2(1^2+1^2+0^2) = 2(\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2$.\n\nThe BZ faces are the planes that are the perpendicular bisectors of these vectors.

We first find the inverse of $\\mathbf{A}$:\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{A}) = a^2 \\left(1 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2 $$\n$$ \\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(\\mathbf{A})} \\begin{pmatrix} a\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -a\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0 & a \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}a^2} \\begin{pmatrix} a\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -a\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0 & a \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{a} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTransposing the inverse gives:\n$$ (\\mathbf{A}^{-1})^T = \\frac{1}{a} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} & \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe reciprocal lattice vectors are the columns of $\\mathbf{B} = 2\\pi (\\mathbf{A}^{-1})^T$:\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix} \\quad , \\quad \\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThird, we find the coordinates of the high-symmetry points $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{M}$ in the undeformed Brillouin zone.\nThe $\\mathbf{K}$ point is given by $\\mathbf{K} = \\frac{1}{3}(2\\mathbf{b}_{1} + \\mathbf{b}_{2})$:\n$$ \\mathbf{K} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left[ 2 \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = \\frac{2\\pi}{3a} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = \\frac{2\\pi}{3a} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe $\\mathbf{M}$ point is given by $\\mathbf{M} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{b}_{1}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{M} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{a} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nFourth, we calculate the strain-induced shifts $\\Delta \\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{K}^{\\prime} - \\mathbf{K}$ and $\\Delta \\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{M}^{\\prime} - \\mathbf{M}$.\nFor a general point $\\mathbf{P} = c_1 \\mathbf{b}_1 + c_2 \\mathbf{b}_2$, its position in the strained reciprocal space is $\\mathbf{P}^{\\prime} = c_1 \\mathbf{b}_1^{\\prime} + c_2 \\mathbf{b}_2^{\\prime}$. Using the first-order transformation:\n$$ \\mathbf{P}^{\\prime} \\approx c_1 (\\mathbf{I} - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})\\mathbf{b}_1 + c_2 (\\mathbf{I} - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})\\mathbf{b}_2 = (\\mathbf{I} - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})(c_1 \\mathbf{b}_1 + c_2 \\mathbf{b}_2) = (\\mathbf{I} - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})\\mathbf{P} $$\nThe shift $\\Delta \\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{P}^{\\prime} - \\mathbf{P}$ is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathbf{P} = (\\mathbf{I} - \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})\\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{P} = -\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\mathbf{P} $$\nApplying this to the $\\mathbf{K}$ point:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathbf{K} = -\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\mathbf{K} = - \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{xx} & \\epsilon_{xy} \\\\ \\epsilon_{xy} & \\epsilon_{yy} \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{4\\pi}{3a} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = -\\frac{4\\pi}{3a} \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{xx} \\cdot 1 + \\epsilon_{xy} \\cdot 0 \\\\ \\epsilon_{xy} \\cdot 1 + \\epsilon_{yy} \\cdot 0 \\end{pmatrix} = -\\frac{4\\pi}{3a} \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{xx} \\\\ \\epsilon_{xy} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSo the components of the shift are $\\Delta K_x = -\\frac{4\\pi}{3a}\\epsilon_{xx}$ and $\\Delta K_y = -\\frac{4\\pi}{3a}\\epsilon_{xy}$.\n\nApplying the shift formula to the $\\mathbf{M}$ point:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathbf{M} = -\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\mathbf{M} = - \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{xx} & \\epsilon_{xy} \\\\ \\epsilon_{xy} & \\epsilon_{yy} \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{a} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{a} \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{xx} \\cdot 1 + \\epsilon_{xy} \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}) \\\\ \\epsilon_{xy} \\cdot 1 + \\epsilon_{yy} \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}) \\end{pmatrix} = -\\frac{\\pi}{a} \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{xx} - \\frac{\\epsilon_{xy}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\\\ \\epsilon_{xy} - \\frac{\\epsilon_{yy}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe components of the shift for $\\mathbf{M}$ are $\\Delta M_x = -\\frac{\\pi}{a}(\\epsilon_{xx} - \\frac{\\epsilon_{xy}}{\\sqrt{3}})$ and $\\Delta M_y = -\\frac{\\pi}{a}(\\epsilon_{xy} - \\frac{\\epsilon_{yy}}{\\sqrt{3}})$.\n\nWe now assemble the four components $(\\Delta K_{x}, \\Delta K_{y}, \\Delta M_{x}, \\Delta M_{y})$ into a single row matrix as required.\n$$ \\Delta K_x = -\\frac{4\\pi}{3a} \\epsilon_{xx} $$\n$$ \\Delta K_y = -\\frac{4\\pi}{3a} \\epsilon_{xy} $$\n$$ \\Delta M_x = -\\frac{\\pi}{a} \\epsilon_{xx} + \\frac{\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}} \\epsilon_{xy} $$\n$$ \\Delta M_y = -\\frac{\\pi}{a} \\epsilon_{xy} + \\frac{\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}} \\epsilon_{yy} $$\nThese are the final expressions.",
