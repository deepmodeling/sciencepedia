            "solution": "The problem statement is a standard exercise in solid-state physics, asking for the derivation of the band dispersion and effective mass within the one-dimensional tight-binding model. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three stages: first, diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in momentum space to find the band dispersion $E(k)$; second, computation of the effective mass $m^{*}$ from the curvature of the band at its minimum; third, a qualitative discussion of the physical implications.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given in second-quantized form in the real-space basis $\\{|n\\rangle\\}$:\n$$\n\\hat{H} \\;=\\; \\varepsilon_{0} \\sum_{n} c_{n}^{\\dagger} c_{n} \\;-\\; t \\sum_{n} \\left( c_{n}^{\\dagger} c_{n+1} \\;+\\; c_{n+1}^{\\dagger} c_{n} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is the on-site energy and $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping integral. To diagonalize this Hamiltonian, we transform from the real-space operators $c_n$ to momentum-space operators $c_k$ using the discrete Fourier transform specified:\n$$\nc_{n} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k R_{n}) c_{k}, \\quad R_{n} = na\n$$\nThe corresponding creation operator is:\n$$\nc_{n}^{\\dagger} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k'} \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k' R_{n}) c_{k'}^{\\dagger}\n$$\nWe transform each term of the Hamiltonian. The on-site energy term becomes:\n$$\n\\sum_{n} c_{n}^{\\dagger} c_{n} = \\sum_{n} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k'} \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k' R_{n}) c_{k'}^{\\dagger} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k R_{n}) c_{k} \\right) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k, k'} c_{k'}^{\\dagger} c_{k} \\sum_{n} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} (k - k') R_{n})\n$$\nThe sum over site index $n$ is a key identity based on the properties of discrete Fourier series under periodic boundary conditions:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} (k - k') na) = N \\delta_{k, k'}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{k, k'}$ is the Kronecker delta. Substituting this back, the on-site term simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sum_{n} c_{n}^{\\dagger} c_{n} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k, k'} c_{k'}^{\\dagger} c_{k} (N \\delta_{k, k'}) = \\sum_{k} c_{k}^{\\dagger} c_{k}\n$$\nNext, we transform the hopping term $\\sum_{n} c_{n}^{\\dagger} c_{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n} c_{n}^{\\dagger} c_{n+1} = \\sum_{n} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k'} \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k' R_{n}) c_{k'}^{\\dagger} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k R_{n+1}) c_{k} \\right)\n$$\nUsing $R_{n+1} = R_n + a$, we have $\\exp(\\mathrm{i} k R_{n+1}) = \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k R_n) \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k a)$. The expression becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k, k'} c_{k'}^{\\dagger} c_{k} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k a) \\sum_{n} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} (k - k') R_{n}) = \\sum_{k} c_{k}^{\\dagger} c_{k} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k a)\n$$\nThe other hopping term, $\\sum_{n} c_{n+1}^{\\dagger} c_{n}$, is the Hermitian conjugate of the first:\n$$\n\\sum_{n} c_{n+1}^{\\dagger} c_{n} = \\left(\\sum_{n} c_{n}^{\\dagger} c_{n+1}\\right)^{\\dagger} = \\left(\\sum_{k} c_{k}^{\\dagger} c_{k} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k a)\\right)^{\\dagger} = \\sum_{k} c_{k}^{\\dagger} c_{k} \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k a)\n$$\nsince $c_k$ are fermionic operators.\nCombining all transformed terms, the Hamiltonian in the momentum basis is:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\varepsilon_{0} \\sum_{k} c_{k}^{\\dagger} c_{k} - t \\sum_{k} \\left(c_{k}^{\\dagger} c_{k} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} k a) + c_{k}^{\\dagger} c_{k} \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k a)\\right)\n$$\nUsing Euler's identity $\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\theta) + \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\theta) = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, we get:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\sum_{k} \\left[ \\varepsilon_{0} - 2t \\cos(ka) \\right] c_{k}^{\\dagger} c_{k}\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian is diagonal in this basis. The energy eigenvalue for a state with crystal momentum $k$ is the coefficient of the number operator $c_{k}^{\\dagger} c_{k}$. This is the band dispersion relation:\n$$\nE(k) = \\varepsilon_{0} - 2t \\cos(ka)\n$$\nNow, we compute the effective mass $m^{*}$. The effective mass is defined from a parabolic approximation of the band structure near an extremum $k_{0}$:\n$$\nE(k) \\approx E(k_{0}) + \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m^{*}} (k - k_{0})^{2}\n$$\nBy comparing this to the Taylor series expansion of $E(k)$ around $k_{0}$, $E(k) \\approx E(k_0) + \\frac{dE}{dk}|_{k_0}(k-k_0) + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2}|_{k_0}(k-k_0)^2$, and noting that $\\frac{dE}{dk}|_{k_0}=0$ at an extremum, we find the relation:\n$$\nm^{*} = \\hbar^{2} \\left( \\frac{d^{2}E}{dk^{2}} \\right)^{-1}_{k=k_{0}}\n$$\nWe need to calculate the second derivative of $E(k)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dk} = \\frac{d}{dk} \\left( \\varepsilon_{0} - 2t \\cos(ka) \\right) = -2t (-a \\sin(ka)) = 2ta \\sin(ka)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}E}{dk^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dk} \\left( 2ta \\sin(ka) \\right) = 2ta (a \\cos(ka)) = 2ta^{2} \\cos(ka)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the band bottom is at $k=0$. This implies that $k_{0}=0$ is a minimum. For this to be true, the curvature (second derivative) must be positive at $k_0=0$. Let's evaluate the curvature at $k=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}E}{dk^{2}}\\bigg|_{k=0} = 2ta^{2} \\cos(0) = 2ta^{2}\n$$\nFor this to represent a band bottom (a minimum), we must have $2ta^{2} > 0$, which implies $t>0$, as mentioned in the problem statement. In this case, the effective mass is:\n$$\nm^{*} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2ta^{2}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for an expression in terms of $|t|$ that is valid for any real $t$. The physically meaningful quantity is the effective mass at the band bottom. Let's analyze the case where $t<0$. The curvature at $k=0$ is $2ta^2 < 0$, so $k=0$ is a band maximum. The band bottom, a minimum, would occur where the cosine term in $E(k)$ is maximal, i.e., $\\cos(ka)=-1$, which happens at $ka=\\pi$ (or $k=\\pi/a$). The curvature at this point is $\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2}|_{k=\\pi/a} = 2ta^2\\cos(\\pi) = -2ta^2$. Since $t<0$, this curvature is positive, confirming a minimum. The value of the curvature is $-2(-|t|)a^2 = 2|t|a^2$.\nThus, the curvature at the band bottom, irrespective of its location ($k=0$ for $t>0$ or $k=\\pi/a$ for $t<0$), is always $2|t|a^{2}$. Therefore, the general expression for the effective mass at the band bottom is:\n$$\nm^{*} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2|t|a^{2}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we provide a qualitative explanation of the relationship between the hopping magnitude $|t|$, band curvature, and effective mass.\nThe magnitude of the hopping integral, $|t|$, represents the strength of the quantum mechanical coupling between orbitals on adjacent atoms. A larger $|t|$ signifies greater orbital overlap and a higher probability for an electron to tunnel between sites.\nThe total width of the energy band (bandwidth) is given by $\\Delta E = E_{max} - E_{min} = (\\varepsilon_{0} + 2|t|) - (\\varepsilon_{0} - 2|t|) = 4|t|$.\nThe curvature of the band at its minimum is $C = \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2}|_{k=k_{min}} = 2|t|a^{2}$.\nFrom these relations, we observe that as the magnitude of hopping $|t|$ decreases:\n1.  The bandwidth $\\Delta E$ decreases. The energy band becomes narrower.\n2.  The curvature $C$ at the band bottom decreases. The band becomes \"flatter\" near the minimum.\nThe effective mass is inversely proportional to this curvature: $m^{*} = \\hbar^{2}/C = \\hbar^{2}/(2|t|a^{2})$.\nTherefore, as $|t|$ decreases, the curvature $C$ decreases, and consequently, the effective mass $m^{*}$ increases.\nThe physical picture is that a smaller hopping integral $|t|$ implies weaker electronic communication between neighboring sites. Electrons are more localized and less mobile, behaving as if they have a larger inertia, which corresponds to a larger effective mass. Conversely, a large $|t|$ (strong overlap) leads to highly delocalized electrons that can move easily through the crystal, corresponding to a small effective mass and high mobility. This principle is fundamental in materials engineering for nanoelectronics, where tuning orbital overlap (e.g., through strain or in heterostructures like twisted bilayer graphene) allows for the design of materials with specific electronic properties, such as flat bands (very large $m^{*}$) that host strongly correlated electron phenomena, or highly dispersive bands (small $m^{*}$) for high-speed transistors.",

Use the following fundamental bases:\n\n- The retarded Green's function of the finite central region is given by $G^{r}(E) = \\left[(E + i\\eta) I - H_{\\mathrm{C}} - \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{L}}(E) - \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{R}}(E)\\right]^{-1}$, where $H_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is the tight-binding Hamiltonian of the central chain, $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{L}}(E)$ and $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{R}}(E)$ are the retarded self-energies due to the semi-infinite left and right leads, and $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal (numerical broadening) expressed in eV.\n- The self-energy for a semi-infinite one-dimensional tight-binding lead (nearest-neighbor hopping $\\pm t$ and on-site energy $\\varepsilon$) attached via coupling $\\tau$ to the chain boundary site is $\\Sigma(E) = \\tau^{2} g_{\\mathrm{s}}(E)$, where $g_{\\mathrm{s}}(E)$ is the retarded surface Green's function of the decoupled semi-infinite lead. The retarded branch must be chosen such that the imaginary part is negative inside the band and zero outside the band.\n- The coupling matrices are defined as $\\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E) = i \\left[\\Sigma_{\\alpha}(E) - \\Sigma_{\\alpha}^{\\dagger}(E)\\right]$ for $\\alpha \\in \\{\\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{R}\\}$.\n- The transmission at energy $E$ is $T(E) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{L}}(E) G^{r}(E) \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{R}}(E) G^{a}(E)\\right]$, where $G^{a}(E) = \\left(G^{r}(E)\\right)^{\\dagger}$.\n- The Landauer formula for the zero-temperature, linear-response conductance is $G = \\left(2 e^{2} / h\\right) T\\left(E_{\\mathrm{F}}\\right)$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is the Planck constant.\n\nConstruct $H_{\\mathrm{C}}$ as an $N \\times N$ matrix with $(H_{\\mathrm{C}})_{ii} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{C}}$ and $(H_{\\mathrm{C}})_{i,i+1} = (H_{\\mathrm{C}})_{i+1,i} = t_{\\mathrm{C}}$ for $i = 1,\\dots,N-1$, and zeros otherwise. The self-energies act only on the boundary sites: $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{L}}(E)$ contributes to the $(1,1)$ entry, and $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{R}}(E)$ contributes to the $(N,N)$ entry.\n\nImplement the retarded surface Green's function $g_{\\mathrm{s}}(E)$ for a semi-infinite one-dimensional tight-binding chain with on-site energy $\\varepsilon$ and nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude $t$ by solving the quadratic relation that emerges from the boundary recursion and by selecting the retarded branch:\n- Let $\\Delta = E - \\varepsilon$ and $B = 2 |t|$. Then\n  - If $|\\Delta| < B$ (inside the band), $g_{\\mathrm{s}}(E) = \\dfrac{\\Delta - i \\sqrt{B^{2} - \\Delta^{2}}}{2 |t|^{2}}$.\n  - If $\\Delta \\geq B$ (above the band), $g_{\\mathrm{s}}(E) = \\dfrac{\\Delta - \\sqrt{\\Delta^{2} - B^{2}}}{2 |t|^{2}}$.\n  - If $\\Delta \\leq -B$ (below the band), $g_{\\mathrm{s}}(E) = \\dfrac{\\Delta + \\sqrt{\\Delta^{2} - B^{2}}}{2 |t|^{2}}$.\n\nYour program must compute $G$ in Siemens (S) for the following test suite. Use $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}$ Coulomb and $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}$ Joule-second. Use a small numerical broadening $\\eta = 10^{-12}$ eV.\n\nTest suite (each case is $(N, t_{\\mathrm{C}}, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{C}}, t_{\\mathrm{L}}, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{L}}, t_{\\mathrm{R}}, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{R}}, \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}}, \\tau_{\\mathrm{R}}, E_{\\mathrm{F}}, \\eta)$):\n- Case A (ballistic matching): $(N = 10, t_{\\mathrm{C}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.0, t_{\\mathrm{L}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.0, t_{\\mathrm{R}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.0, \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}} = -1.0, \\tau_{\\mathrm{R}} = -1.0, E_{\\mathrm{F}} = 0.0, \\eta = 10^{-12})$.\n- Case B (outside the lead band): $(N = 10, t_{\\mathrm{C}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.0, t_{\\mathrm{L}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.0, t_{\\mathrm{R}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.0, \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}} = -1.0, \\tau_{\\mathrm{R}} = -1.0, E_{\\mathrm{F}} = 3.0, \\eta = 10^{-12})$.\n- Case C (weak coupling): $(N = 10, t_{\\mathrm{C}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.0, t_{\\mathrm{L}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.0, t_{\\mathrm{R}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.0, \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}} = -0.1, \\tau_{\\mathrm{R}} = -0.1, E_{\\mathrm{F}} = 0.0, \\eta = 10^{-12})$.\n- Case D (asymmetric couplings): $(N = 10, t_{\\mathrm{C}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.0, t_{\\mathrm{L}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.0, t_{\\mathrm{R}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.0, \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}} = -1.0, \\tau_{\\mathrm{R}} = -0.5, E_{\\mathrm{F}} = 0.0, \\eta = 10^{-12})$.\n- Case E (on-site barrier in the chain): $(N = 10, t_{\\mathrm{C}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.5, t_{\\mathrm{L}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.0, t_{\\mathrm{R}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.0, \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}} = -1.0, \\tau_{\\mathrm{R}} = -1.0, E_{\\mathrm{F}} = 0.0, \\eta = 10^{-12})$.\n- Case F (single-site central region): $(N = 1, t_{\\mathrm{C}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.0, t_{\\mathrm{L}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.0, t_{\\mathrm{R}} = -1.0, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.0, \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}} = -1.0, \\tau_{\\mathrm{R}} = -1.0, E_{\\mathrm{F}} = 0.0, \\eta = 10^{-12})$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the conductances for Cases A–F, in Siemens (S), as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, $[\\text{G}_{A}, \\text{G}_{B}, \\text{G}_{C}, \\text{G}_{D}, \\text{G}_{E}, \\text{G}_{F}]$, where each $\\text{G}_{\\cdot}$ is a floating-point number in S.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the zero-temperature, linear-response electrical conductance of a one-dimensional molecular junction. The system is modeled as a central tight-binding chain of `$N$` sites coupled to semi-infinite left and right leads. The calculation will be performed using the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism combined with the Landauer formula.\n\nThe logical procedure is as follows:\n1. Construct the Hamiltonian `$H_{\\mathrm{C}}$` for the isolated central region.\n2. Determine the retarded self-energies, `$\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{L}}(E)$` and `$\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{R}}(E)$`, which describe the influence of the semi-infinite leads on the central region.\n3. Calculate the full retarded Green's function `$G^{r}(E)$` for the central region, which now includes the effects of the leads.\n4. From the self-energies, compute the coupling matrices `$\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{L}}(E)$` and `$\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{R}}(E)$` that quantify the rate of electron exchange between the central region and the leads.\n5. Combine these elements to calculate the transmission probability `$T(E)$` through the junction at the Fermi energy `$E_{\\mathrm{F}}$`.\n6. Finally, use the Landauer formula to obtain the conductance `$G$`.\n\nWe will evaluate the conductance `$G$` at the Fermi energy `$E_{\\mathrm{F}}$`. All energy-dependent quantities will therefore be computed at `$E = E_{\\mathrm{F}}$`.\n\n**Step 1: Central Region Hamiltonian, `$H_{\\mathrm{C}}$`**\nThe central region is a 1D tight-binding chain of `$N$` sites with on-site energy `$\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{C}}$` and nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude `$t_{\\mathrm{C}}$`. The Hamiltonian `$H_{\\mathrm{C}}$` is an `$N \\times N$` real, symmetric, tridiagonal matrix:\n$$\n(H_{\\mathrm{C}})_{ij} = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{C}} & \\text{if } i = j \\\\\nt_{\\mathrm{C}} & \\text{if } |i - j| = 1 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere site indices `$i,j$` run from `$1$` to `$N$`.\n\n**Step 2: Lead Self-Energies, `$\\Sigma_{\\alpha}(E)$`**\nThe semi-infinite leads are also modeled as 1D tight-binding chains. The effect of a lead `$\\alpha \\in \\{\\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{R}\\}$` on the central region is captured by a retarded self-energy `$\\Sigma_{\\alpha}(E)$`. It is defined as `$\\Sigma_{\\alpha}(E) = \\tau_{\\alpha}^{2} g_{\\mathrm{s}, \\alpha}(E)$`, where `$\\tau_{\\alpha}$` is the coupling strength and `$g_{\\mathrm{s}, \\alpha}(E)$` is the retarded surface Green's function of the decoupled lead `$\\alpha$`.\n\nThe surface Green's function `$g_{\\mathrm{s}}(E)$` for a lead with on-site energy `$\\varepsilon$` and hopping `$t$` is given by the problem as a piecewise function of `$\\Delta = E - \\varepsilon$` and `$B = 2|t|$`.\n- If `$|\\Delta| < B$` (energy is inside the lead's conduction band):\n$$g_{\\mathrm{s}}(E) = \\frac{\\Delta - i \\sqrt{B^{2} - \\Delta^{2}}}{2 |t|^{2}}$$\nThe imaginary part is non-zero, indicating available states for transport.\n- If `$|\\Delta| \\geq B$` (energy is outside the lead's band):\n$$g_{\\mathrm{s}}(E) = \\frac{\\Delta \\mp \\sqrt{\\Delta^{2} - B^{2}}}{2 |t|^{2}}$$\nwhere the minus sign is for `$\\Delta \\ge B$` and the plus sign is for `$\\Delta \\le -B$`. The imaginary part is zero, indicating no available states and thus no transport at that energy.\n\nThe self-energies are `$N \\times N$` matrices that are zero everywhere except for the elements corresponding to the site of coupling. The left lead couples to site `$1$`, and the right lead couples to site `$N$`.\nThe left self-energy matrix `$\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{L}}(E)$` has one non-zero element:\n$$(\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{L}}(E))_{11} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{L}}^{2} g_{\\mathrm{s}, \\mathrm{L}}(E)$$\nThe right self-energy matrix `$\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{R}}(E)$` has one non-zero element:\n$$(\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{R}}(E))_{NN} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{R}}^{2} g_{\\mathrm{s}, \\mathrm{R}}(E)$$\nNote that if `$N=1$`, both self-energies contribute to the `$(1,1)$` element.\n\n**Step 3: Full Retarded Green's Function, `$G^{r}(E)$`**\nThe retarded Green's function of the central region, including the influence of the leads, is calculated by solving the Dyson equation. The result is:\n$$G^{r}(E) = \\left[ (E + i\\eta)I - H_{\\mathrm{C}} - \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{L}}(E) - \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{R}}(E) \\right]^{-1}$$\nHere, `$I$` is the `$N \\times N$` identity matrix, and `$\\eta$` is a small positive broadening term (e.g., `$10^{-12} \\text{ eV}$`) that ensures numerical stability by shifting the poles of the Green's function slightly into the complex plane. The advanced Green's function is the Hermitian conjugate of the retarded one: `$G^{a}(E) = (G^{r}(E))^{\\dagger}`.\n\n**Step 4: Coupling Matrices, `$\\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E)$`**\nThe coupling matrices `$\\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E)$` describe the broadening of the energy levels in the central region due to their coupling to the continuum of states in the leads. They are given by the anti-Hermitian part of the self-energies:\n$$\\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E) = i \\left[ \\Sigma_{\\alpha}(E) - \\Sigma_{\\alpha}^{\\dagger}(E) \\right]$$\nSince `$\\Sigma_{\\alpha}(E) = \\tau_{\\alpha}^{2} g_{\\mathrm{s}, \\alpha}(E)$` and `$\\tau_{\\alpha}$` is real, `$\\Sigma_{\\alpha}^{\\dagger}(E) = \\tau_{\\alpha}^{2} (g_{\\mathrm{s}, \\alpha}(E))^{*}$`. The formula simplifies to:\n$$\\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E) = i \\tau_{\\alpha}^{2} \\left( g_{\\mathrm{s}, \\alpha}(E) - (g_{\\mathrm{s}, \\alpha}(E))^{*} \\right) = i \\tau_{\\alpha}^{2} \\left( 2i \\operatorname{Im}[g_{\\mathrm{s}, \\alpha}(E)] \\right) = -2 \\tau_{\\alpha}^{2} \\operatorname{Im}[g_{\\mathrm{s}, \\alpha}(E)]$$\nLike the self-energies, the `$\\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E)$` matrices are non-zero only at the coupling sites.\n\n**Step 5: Transmission Probability, `$T(E)$`**\nThe probability for an electron at energy `$E$` to transmit from the left lead to the right lead is given by the Fisher-Lee relation:\n$$T(E) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{L}}(E) G^{r}(E) \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{R}}(E) G^{a}(E) \\right]$$\nGiven that `$\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{L}}$` is non-zero only at index `$(1,1)$` and `$\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{R}}$` is non-zero only at index `$(N,N)$`, the trace simplifies significantly:\n$$T(E) = (\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{L}}(E))_{11} |(G^{r}(E))_{1N}|^2 (\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{R}}(E))_{NN}$$\nwhere `$(G^{r}(E))_{1N}` is the element of the retarded Green's function connecting the first and last sites of the chain.\n\n**Step 6: Conductance, `$G$`**\nAt zero temperature, the linear-response conductance is given by the Landauer formula, which relates `$G$` to the transmission at the Fermi energy `$E_{\\mathrm{F}}$`. Including the factor of `$2$` for spin degeneracy:\n$$G = \\frac{2e^2}{h} T(E_{\\mathrm{F}})$$\nThe prefactor `$G_0 = 2e^2/h$` is the quantum of conductance, approximately `$7.748 \\times 10^{-5}`$ S. We will use the provided values for the elementary charge `$e$` and Planck's constant `$h$` to compute this prefactor accurately.\n\nThe implementation will follow these steps for each test case provided in the problem statement. All energy parameters are in eV, and the fundamental constants are in SI units, so the final conductance `$G$` will be in Siemens (S).",
