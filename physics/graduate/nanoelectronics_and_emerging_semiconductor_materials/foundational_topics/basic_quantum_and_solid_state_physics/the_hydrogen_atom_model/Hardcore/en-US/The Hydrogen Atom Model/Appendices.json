The hydrogenic model for shallow impurities in semiconductors, incorporating effective mass and dielectric screening, is a cornerstone of semiconductor physics. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear path from first principles to a specific numerical result. The language is objective and uses standard terminology.

The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Effective Scales and Binding Energy**\n\nThe starting point is the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a single electron of effective mass $m^{*}$ moving in the Coulomb potential of a fixed positive charge $+e$. The potential is screened by the semiconductor's static dielectric constant $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r}$. The equation is:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m^{*}} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{r}}^{2} + V(\\boldsymbol{r}) \\right] \\psi(\\boldsymbol{r}) = E \\psi(\\boldsymbol{r})\n$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The screened Coulomb potential is given by:\n$$\nV(\\boldsymbol{r}) = -\\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r}r}\n$$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $r = |\\boldsymbol{r}|$. The full Schrödinger equation in position space is:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m^{*}} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{r}}^{2} - \\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r}r} \\right] \\psi(\\boldsymbol{r}) = E \\psi(\\boldsymbol{r})\n$$\nWe now non-dimensionalize this equation using the given scaling relations: $r = \\ell \\rho$ and $E = \\mathcal{E} \\varepsilon$. The coordinates are related by $\\boldsymbol{r} = \\ell \\boldsymbol{\\rho}$. The gradient operator transforms according to the chain rule: $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{r}} = \\frac{1}{\\ell} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}$. Consequently, the Laplacian operator transforms as $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{r}}^{2} = \\frac{1}{\\ell^{2}} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}^{2}$.\n\nSubstituting the scaled variables into the Schrödinger equation:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m^{*}} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\ell^{2}} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}^{2}\\right) - \\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r}(\\ell\\rho)} \\right] \\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}) = (\\mathcal{E}\\varepsilon) \\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\rho})\n$$\nTo simplify this equation towards the target form, we multiply the entire equation by $\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{E}}$:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m^{*}\\ell^{2}\\mathcal{E}} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}^{2} - \\frac{e^{2}}{4pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r}\\ell\\mathcal{E}\\rho} \\right] \\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}) = \\varepsilon \\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\rho})\n$$\nThe problem states that this equation must be identical to the dimensionless Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom in atomic units:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_{\\rho}^{2}\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}) - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}) = \\varepsilon \\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\rho})\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the kinetic and potential energy terms in our scaled equation with this target form, we can determine the characteristic scales $\\ell$ and $\\mathcal{E}$.\n\nFrom the kinetic energy term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m^{*}\\ell^{2}\\mathcal{E}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{m^{*}\\ell^{2}\\mathcal{E}} = 1\n$$\nThis gives our first relation: $ \\mathcal{E} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{m^{*}\\ell^{2}} $.\n\nFrom the potential energy term:\n$$\n\\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r}\\ell\\mathcal{E}} = 1\n$$\nThis gives our second relation: $ \\mathcal{E} = \\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r}\\ell} $.\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the two unknowns $\\ell$ and $\\mathcal{E}$. We can find $\\ell$ by equating the two expressions for $\\mathcal{E}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{m^{*}\\ell^{2}} = \\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r}\\ell}\n$$\nSolving for $\\ell$ yields the effective Bohr radius for the donor:\n$$\n\\ell = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r}\\hbar^{2}}{m^{*}e^{2}}\n$$\nThis is the characteristic length scale $\\ell$.

The ground state corresponds to $n=1$, so the ground-state dimensionless energy is $\\varepsilon_{1} = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe actual ground-state energy of the donor electron is $E_{1,\\text{total}} = \\mathcal{E} \\varepsilon_{1} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{E}$. The binding energy is defined as the energy required to promote the electron from the ground state to the continuum (the bottom of the conduction band, where $E=0$). Therefore, the ground-state binding energy, $E_{1}$, is the positive value:\n$$\nE_{1} = -E_{1,\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{m^{*}e^{4}}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r})^{2}\\hbar^{2}} \\right] = \\frac{m^{*}e^{4}}{2(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}\\epsilon_{r}^{2}\\hbar^{2}}\n$$\nWe can relate this to the Rydberg energy, $R_{\\infty} = \\frac{m_{e}e^{4}}{2(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}\\hbar^{2}} \\approx 13.6\\,\\text{eV}$.

The latter is an approximation that becomes accurate for a sufficiently large $r_{\\max}$, where the wavefunction of a bound state has decayed to a negligible value.\n\nThe grid consists of $N$ interior points $r_i = i \\cdot dr$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, N$. The grid spacing is $dr = r_{\\max} / (N+1)$. The function $u(r)$ is represented by its values at these grid points, $u_i = u(r_i)$. The second derivative of $u(r)$ at a point $r_i$ is approximated using a centered finite-difference formula:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u}{dr^2}\\Big|_{r_i} \\approx \\frac{u(r_i-dr) - 2u(r_i) + u(r_i+dr)}{dr^2} = \\frac{u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1}}{dr^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the radial Schrödinger equation for each grid point $r_i$ yields a system of $N$ coupled linear algebraic equations:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m^*} \\left( \\frac{u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1}}{dr^2} \\right) + \\left[ \\frac{\\hbar^2\\,\\ell(\\ell+1)}{2 m^*\\,r_i^2} - \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r\\, r_i} \\right] u_i = E\\,u_i\n$$\nThis system of equations can be rearranged and expressed in the form of a matrix eigenvalue problem, $H\\mathbf{u} = E\\mathbf{u}$, where $\\mathbf{u}$ is a column vector $(u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_N)^T$ and $H$ is an $N \\times N$ matrix representing the discretized Hamiltonian operator. By collecting the coefficients of $u_{i-1}$, $u_i$, and $u_{i+1}$, we can identify the elements of the matrix $H$:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*dr^2}\\right) u_{i-1} + \\left( \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m^*dr^2} + \\frac{\\hbar^2\\,\\ell(\\ell+1)}{2m^*\\,r_i^2} - \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r\\, r_i} \\right) u_i + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*dr^2}\\right) u_{i+1} = E u_i\n$$\nThe resulting Hamiltonian matrix $H$ is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix. Its diagonal elements $H_{ii}$ and off-diagonal elements $H_{i,i\\pm 1}$ are given by:\n$$\nH_{ii} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m^*dr^2} + \\frac{\\hbar^2\\,\\ell(\\ell+1)}{2m^*\\,r_i^2} - \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r\\, r_i}\n$$\n$$\nH_{i,i\\pm 1} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*dr^2}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions $u_0 = u(0) = 0$ and $u_{N+1} = u(r_{\\max}) = 0$ are incorporated into the equations for $i=1$ and $i=N$, respectively.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure to find the lowest bound-state energy for each parameter set is as follows:\n$1$. Define the physical constants ($\\hbar, e, \\epsilon_0, m_e$) in SI units.\n$2$. For each test case specified by $(m^*/m_e, \\varepsilon_r, \\ell, N, M)$:\n    a. Calculate the material-specific effective mass $m^* = (m^*/m_e) \\cdot m_e$.\n    b. Calculate the effective Bohr radius $a^* = \\frac{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r\\,\\hbar^2}{m^*\\,e^2}$, which establishes the characteristic length scale of the system.\n    c. Define the numerical grid parameters: the simulation boundary $r_{\\max} = M \\cdot a^*$ and the grid spacing $dr = r_{\\max} / (N+1)$.\n    d. Construct the discrete radial coordinate vector $r_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, N$.\n    e. Assemble the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the $N \\times N$ Hamiltonian matrix $H$ according to the formulas derived above. The diagonal is a vector of length $N$, and the off-diagonals are vectors of length $N-1$.\n    f. Solve the eigenvalue problem for the symmetric tridiagonal matrix $H$. This yields a set of $N$ real eigenvalues, which are the discretized energy levels of the system.\n    g. The lowest eigenvalue corresponds to the ground state energy for the specified angular momentum channel $\\ell$. This energy is obtained in Joules.\n    h. Convert the lowest energy from Joules to electronvolts (eV) by dividing by the elementary charge $e$. The result is then rounded to the required precision.\n\nThis procedure avoids any use of analytical formulas for the energy spectrum, instead calculating the energies directly from the numerical solution of the discretized Schrödinger equation, as required. The use of specialized numerical routines for tridiagonal symmetric matrices ensures computational efficiency.",
