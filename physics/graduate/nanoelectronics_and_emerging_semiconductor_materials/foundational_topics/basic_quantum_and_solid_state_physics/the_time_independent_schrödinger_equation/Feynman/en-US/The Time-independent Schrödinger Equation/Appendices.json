            "solution": "The problem presented is a standard, fundamental exercise in quantum mechanics, the so-called \"particle in a box\". The statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains no ambiguities. I shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) for a particle of mass $m$ in one dimension, which is an eigenvalue equation for the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}$:\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)\n$$\nwhere the Hamiltonian is given by $\\hat{H} = -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} + V(x)$. The potential $V(x)$ is defined as $V(x)=0$ for $x \\in (0, L)$ and $V(x)=+\\infty$ for $x \\notin (0, L)$.\n\n1. Formulation of the Boundary-Value Problem\n\nFirst, consider the regions where the potential is infinite, i.e., $x \\le 0$ and $x \\ge L$. In these regions, the TISE can be written formally as $(E - V(x))\\psi(x) = -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}\\psi}{dx^{2}}$. If $V(x) \\to +\\infty$, then for this equation to hold for a finite energy $E$ and a well-behaved second derivative, the wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ must be identically zero. Any non-zero value would lead to an infinite term on the left side that cannot be balanced by the right side. Thus, the physical requirement that the particle cannot be found in a region of infinite potential energy implies that $|\\psi(x)|^{2}=0$, and therefore $\\psi(x)=0$ for all $x \\le 0$ and $x \\ge L$.\n\nSecond, a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics is that the wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ must be a continuous function of position $x$. A discontinuity in $\\psi(x)$ would imply an infinite first derivative (a Dirac delta function), and a still more singular second derivative, leading to an infinite kinetic energy, which is not physically plausible. The continuity of $\\psi(x)$ at the boundaries of the well, $x=0$ and $x=L$, is thus required.\nConnecting the solution inside the well to the solution outside, we must have:\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 0^{+}} \\psi(x) = \\psi(0) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to L^{-}} \\psi(x) = \\psi(L) = 0\n$$\nThese are the Dirichlet boundary conditions for the problem on the interval $(0, L)$.\n\nA more formal justification comes from the requirement that the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}$ be self-adjoint (Hermitian) on its domain of definition. The domain consists of functions for which $\\hat{H}\\psi$ is square-integrable. For any two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ in the domain of $\\hat{H}$, the self-adjoint property requires $\\langle f, \\hat{H}g \\rangle = \\langle \\hat{H}f, g \\rangle$, where the inner product is defined as $\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{L} f^{*}(x)g(x)dx$. Let us compute the inner product $\\langle f, \\hat{H}g \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle f, \\hat{H}g \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{L} f^{*}(x) \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}g}{dx^{2}}\\right) dx\n$$\nIntegrating by parts twice yields:\n$$\n\\langle f, \\hat{H}g \\rangle = -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\left[f^{*}\\frac{dg}{dx} - \\frac{df^{*}}{dx}g\\right]_{0}^{L} + \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}f^{*}}{dx^{2}}\\right) g(x) dx\n$$\nThe second term on the right-hand side is $\\langle \\hat{H}f, g \\rangle$. For $\\hat{H}$ to be self-adjoint, the boundary term must vanish:\n$$\n\\left[f^{*}(x)\\frac{dg(x)}{dx} - \\frac{df^{*}(x)}{dx}g(x)\\right]_{0}^{L} = 0\n$$\nThis condition must hold for all functions $f, g$ in the domain of $\\hat{H}$. A sufficient set of conditions to ensure this is that all such functions vanish at the boundaries: $\\psi(0)=0$ and $\\psi(L)=0$. These are precisely the boundary conditions derived from the physical argument.\n\nThus, the boundary-value problem is:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}\\psi(x)}{dx^{2}} = E\\psi(x), \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,L)\n$$\nsubject to the boundary conditions $\\psi(0) = 0$ and $\\psi(L) = 0$.\n\n2. Solution of the Eigenvalue Problem\n\nLet's solve the differential equation. Rearranging, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}\\psi(x)}{dx^{2}} + \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^{2}}\\psi(x) = 0\n$$\nLet $k^{2} = \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^{2}}$. Since the potential $V(x)=0$ inside the well, the energy $E$ must be positive. If $E \\le 0$, the only solution satisfying the boundary conditions is the trivial one, $\\psi(x)=0$, which is not a valid state function. Thus, $E  0$ and $k$ is a real, positive number. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}\\psi(x)}{dx^{2}} + k^{2}\\psi(x) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this second-order linear homogeneous differential equation is:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx)\n$$\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions. At $x=0$:\n$$\n\\psi(0) = A\\sin(0) + B\\cos(0) = A \\cdot 0 + B \\cdot 1 = B = 0\n$$\nSo the solution must be of the form $\\psi(x) = A\\sin(kx)$. At $x=L$:\n$$\n\\psi(L) = A\\sin(kL) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we must have $A \\neq 0$. Therefore, we must require $\\sin(kL) = 0$. This condition quantizes the possible values of $k$:\n$$\nkL = n\\pi, \\quad \\text{where } n \\text{ is an integer.}\n$$\nThe case $n=0$ gives $k=0$ and $\\psi(x)=0$, the trivial solution, which is excluded. Negative integers ($n  0$) do not produce new physical states, as $\\sin(-z) = -\\sin(z)$. The resulting wavefunction $\\psi_{-n}(x)$ is just a constant multiple ($ -1 $) of $\\psi_{n}(x)$ and represents the same physical state. Thus, we restrict $n$ to positive integers: $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nThe allowed values of $k$ are $k_{n} = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$. Substituting this back into the definition of $k^{2}$:\n$$\nk_{n}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{2mE_{n}}{\\hbar^{2}}\n$$\nSolving for the energy eigenvalues $E_{n}$ gives:\n$$\nE_{n} = \\frac{n^{2}\\pi^{2}\\hbar^{2}}{2mL^{2}}, \\quad n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n$$\nFinally, we normalize the eigenfunctions $\\psi_{n}(x) = A\\sin(k_{n}x)$. The normalization constant $A$ is determined by the condition $\\int_{0}^{L}|\\psi_{n}(x)|^{2}dx = 1$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} A^{2}\\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)dx = 1\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos(2\\theta))$, the integral becomes:\n$$\nA^{2} \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right)dx = A^{2} \\frac{1}{2} \\left[x - \\frac{L}{2n\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{2n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{L}\n$$\nEvaluating the expression at the limits:\n$$\nA^{2} \\frac{1}{2} \\left(L - \\frac{L}{2n\\pi}\\sin(2n\\pi)\\right) - A^{2} \\frac{1}{2}(0) = A^{2}\\frac{L}{2} = 1\n$$\nThis gives $A^{2} = \\frac{2}{L}$. Choosing the real, positive root, we have $A = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}$. The normalized stationary-state eigenfunctions are:\n$$\n\\psi_{n}(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right), \\quad n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n$$\n\n3. Completeness of the Eigenfunctions\n\nThe question of completeness is addressed by Sturm-Liouville (S-L) theory. The eigenvalue problem we have solved, $\\psi'' + \\lambda\\psi = 0$ with $\\psi(0)=0$ and $\\psi(L)=0$ (where $\\lambda = k^2$), is a regular Sturm-Liouville problem. A general regular S-L problem is of the form:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(p(x)\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) + q(x)y + \\lambda w(x)y = 0 \\quad \\text{on a finite interval } [a,b]\n$$\nwith separated boundary conditions. In our case, the interval is $[0,L]$, and we can identify $p(x)=1$, $q(x)=0$, and the weight function $w(x)=1$. The functions $p(x)$ and $w(x)$ are positive and continuous on $[0,L]$, so the problem is indeed regular.\n\nThe Sturm-Liouville theorem makes several powerful statements about such problems. It guarantees the existence of an infinite sequence of real eigenvalues $\\lambda_1  \\lambda_2  \\dots  \\lambda_n  \\dots$ with $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\lambda_n = \\infty$. Furthermore, it states that the corresponding eigenfunctions $\\{\\psi_n(x)\\}$ form a **complete orthogonal basis** for the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on the interval $[a,b]$ with respect to the weight function $w(x)$.\n\nIn our context, the Hilbert space is $L^{2}(0,L)$, the space of functions $f(x)$ such that $\\int_{0}^{L} |f(x)|^{2}dx$ is finite. The weight function is $w(x)=1$. The completeness of the set $\\{\\psi_n(x)\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ means that any arbitrary function $f(x) \\in L^{2}(0,L)$ can be represented as a generalized Fourier series expansion in terms of these eigenfunctions:\n$$\nf(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_{n}\\psi_{n}(x)\n$$\nwhere the coefficients are given by the projection $c_{n} = \\langle \\psi_{n}, f \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{L} \\psi_{n}^{*}(x)f(x)dx$.\n\nThe sense of convergence relevant here is **convergence in the mean**, or $L^{2}$-convergence. This means that if $S_{N}(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} c_{n}\\psi_{n}(x)$ is the partial sum of the series, then the norm of the difference between $f(x)$ and $S_{N}(x)$ approaches zero as $N \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left\\| f - S_{N} \\right\\|^{2} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left|f(x) - \\sum_{n=1}^{N} c_{n}\\psi_{n}(x)\\right|^{2}dx = 0\n$$\nThis mathematical completeness is also a direct consequence of the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators. The Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ with the specified domain (which includes the boundary conditions $\\psi(0)=\\psi(L)=0$) is a self-adjoint operator on $L^2(0,L)$. The spectral theorem asserts that the eigenvectors of such an operator form a complete orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space. The eigenfunctions $\\psi_n(x)$ are precisely these eigenvectors. Physically, this completeness ensures that any allowed initial state of the particle, $\\Psi(x,0) \\in L^{2}(0,L)$, can be expressed as a linear superposition of the stationary states, thus allowing for the complete determination of its future time evolution.",

Using the provided BenDaniel–Duke Hamiltonian, this becomes:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2}\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{m^{\\ast}(x)}\\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx}\\right)+V(x)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)\n$$\nThe potential is constant, $V(x) = V_{0}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{m^{\\ast}(x)}\\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx}\\right) = -\\frac{2(E-V_{0})}{\\hbar^{2}}\\psi(x)\n$$\nSince $EV_{0}$, the solutions will be oscillating plane waves.\n\nWe must first determine the boundary conditions at the interface $x=0$.

Assume temperature is sufficiently low that phonon effects can be neglected, and ignore band mixing beyond the nonparabolic correction.\n\nYour task is to:\n- Starting from the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) with hard-wall boundary conditions and the effective mass approximation, derive the quantized wavevectors and subband energies for a parabolic conduction band.\n- Using a widely-accepted nonparabolic conduction band model characterized by the single parameter $\\alpha$ (in $\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}$), derive the corrected subband energies for the same well, and obtain the energy shift $\\Delta E_n$ defined as the difference between the nonparabolic and parabolic subband energies for a given subband index $n$.\n- Implement a program that computes $\\Delta E_n$ in electronvolts (eV) for each test case listed below. Use the fundamental constant values $\\hbar$ (reduced Planck constant) and $m_0$ (electron rest mass) in SI units; express the final results in $\\mathrm{eV}$, rounded to six decimal places.\n- Treat the effective mass $m^\\ast$ as a scalar constant inside the well, given as a fraction of $m_0$. Treat the well as an infinite square well (hard-wall boundary conditions) with width $L$ specified in nanometers (nm). The subband index $n$ is a positive integer.\n\nPhysical and numerical units:\n- Width $L$ is provided in nanometers (nm); convert to meters (m) for calculations.\n- Effective mass is given as $m^\\ast/m_0$ (dimensionless).\n- The nonparabolicity parameter $\\alpha$ is given in $\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}$.\n- Energies must be reported in electronvolts (eV), rounded to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\nCompute the energy shift $\\Delta E_n$ for the following cases, each defined by the tuple $(L\\ \\mathrm{nm},\\ m^\\ast/m_0,\\ \\alpha\\ \\mathrm{eV}^{-1},\\ n)$:\n1. $(8.0,\\ 0.067,\\ 0.64,\\ 1)$\n2. $(8.0,\\ 0.067,\\ 0.64,\\ 2)$\n3. $(30.0,\\ 0.067,\\ 0.64,\\ 1)$\n4. $(10.0,\\ 0.067,\\ 0.0,\\ 1)$\n\nDesign for coverage:\n- Case 1 is a typical \"happy path\" for a narrow well and moderate nonparabolicity.\n- Case 2 tests a higher subband index in the same well, where nonparabolic effects are stronger.\n- Case 3 is a wide well where nonparabolicity should be weak.\n- Case 4 is the boundary condition $\\alpha = 0$, where the shift should vanish.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[result1,result2,result3,result4]\"), with each result being the energy shift $\\Delta E_n$ in $\\mathrm{eV}$ rounded to six decimals.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the energy shift in a one-dimensional quantum well due to band nonparabolicity and the implementation of a program to compute this shift for several test cases. The derivation and calculation will proceed in three stages: analysis of the parabolic band case, analysis of the nonparabolic band case, and the numerical implementation.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation for a Parabolic Conduction Band\n\nThe starting point is the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) for an electron with effective mass $m^\\ast$ in a potential $V(x)$:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^\\ast} \\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x) \\psi(x) = E \\psi(x)$$\nFor a quantum well of width $L$ with hard-wall (infinite potential) boundary conditions, the potential is defined as:\n$$V(x) = \\begin{cases} 0  \\text{for } 0  x  L \\\\ \\infty  \\text{for } x \\le 0, x \\ge L \\end{cases}$$\nInside the well, where $V(x) = 0$, the TISE simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{2m^\\ast E}{\\hbar^2} \\psi(x)$$\nThis is the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a free particle, which takes the form of the Helmholtz equation: $\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + k^2\\psi(x) = 0$, where the wavevector $k$ is related to the energy $E$ through the standard parabolic dispersion relation:\n$$E = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^\\ast}$$\nThe general solution for the wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ inside the well is $\\psi(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx)$. The hard-wall boundary conditions require the wavefunction to be zero at the edges of the well:\n1.  $\\psi(0) = 0 \\implies A\\sin(0) + B\\cos(0) = 0 \\implies B=0$.\n2.  $\\psi(L) = 0 \\implies A\\sin(kL) = 0$.\n\nFor a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(kL) = 0$. This quantizes the allowed values of the wavevector $k$:\n$$kL = n\\pi \\quad \\text{for} \\quad n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$$\nThe quantized wavevectors are therefore:\n$$k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$$\nSubstituting these quantized wavevectors into the parabolic dispersion relation yields the quantized subband energies for the parabolic case, denoted $E_{p,n}$:\n$$E_{p,n} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_n^2}{2m^\\ast} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2 n^2}{2m^\\ast L^2}$$\n\n### Step 2: Derivation for a Nonparabolic Conduction Band\n\nThe problem introduces a nonparabolic correction to the band structure, described by a parameter $\\alpha$. A widely-used model for this nonparabolicity, derivable from k·p theory, relates energy and wavevector as:\n$$E(1 + \\alpha E) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^\\ast}$$\nHere, $m^\\ast$ is the effective mass at the band edge ($k=0$) and $\\alpha$ is the nonparabolicity parameter. The crucial point is that the boundary conditions are determined by the potential $V(x)$, not the energy-momentum dispersion relation. Therefore, the quantization condition on the wavevector remains unchanged:\n$$k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$$\nWe can find the nonparabolic energies, $E_{np,n}$, by substituting the quantized wavevector $k_n$ into the nonparabolic dispersion relation:\n$$E_{np,n}(1 + \\alpha E_{np,n}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_n^2}{2m^\\ast}$$\nThe right-hand side of this equation is precisely the expression for the parabolic energy $E_{p,n}$. Thus, we have a direct relationship between the parabolic and nonparabolic energies for a given subband index $n$:\n$$E_{np,n}(1 + \\alpha E_{np,n}) = E_{p,n}$$\nThis can be rewritten as a quadratic equation for $E_{np,n}$:\n$$\\alpha E_{np,n}^2 + E_{np,n} - E_{p,n} = 0$$\nSolving for $E_{np,n}$ using the quadratic formula yields:\n$$E_{np,n} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4(\\alpha)(-E_{p,n})}}{2\\alpha} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4\\alpha E_{p,n}}}{2\\alpha}$$\nSince energy must be a positive quantity ($E_{p,n}  0$ and $\\alpha \\ge 0$), we must choose the positive root to ensure $E_{np,n}  0$. Therefore, the corrected subband energy is:\n$$E_{np,n} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + 4\\alpha E_{p,n}} - 1}{2\\alpha}$$\nThis formula is valid for $\\alpha  0$. In the case where $\\alpha = 0$, the model reverts to the parabolic case, and $E_{np,n} = E_{p,n}$. This can be confirmed by taking the limit as $\\alpha \\to 0$ using L'Hôpital's rule.\n\nThe energy shift $\\Delta E_n$ is defined as the difference between the nonparabolic and parabolic energies:\n$$\\Delta E_n = E_{np,n} - E_{p,n} = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + 4\\alpha E_{p,n}} - 1}{2\\alpha} \\right) - E_{p,n}$$\nFor $\\alpha=0$, $\\Delta E_n = 0$. For $\\alpha  0$, since $\\sqrt{1+x}  1+x/2$ for $x  0$, it can be shown that $E_{np,n}  E_{p,n}$, resulting in a negative energy shift. This means the nonparabolic correction lowers the energy levels compared to the purely parabolic approximation.\n\n### Step 3: Methodology for Calculation\n\nThe numerical calculation will be performed as follows:\n1.  Define the fundamental physical constants in SI units: $\\hbar = 1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s, $m_0 = 9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}$ kg, and the elementary charge $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}$ C for energy unit conversion.\n2.  For each test case $(L\\ [\\mathrm{nm}],\\ m^\\ast/m_0,\\ \\alpha\\ [\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}],\\ n)$:\n    a. Convert the given parameters to SI units: $L$ from nm to m ($L \\times 10^{-9}$), and calculate the effective mass in kg ($m^\\ast = (m^\\ast/m_0) \\times m_0$).\n    b. Calculate the parabolic energy $E_{p,n}$ in Joules using $E_{p,n} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2 n^2}{2m^\\ast L^2}$.\n    c. Convert $E_{p,n}$ to electronvolts (eV) by dividing by the elementary charge $e$.\n    d. Check if the nonparabolicity parameter $\\alpha$ is zero. If $\\alpha=0$, the energy shift $\\Delta E_n$ is exactly $0$.\n    e. If $\\alpha  0$, use the value of $E_{p,n}$ in eV and the given $\\alpha$ in $\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}$ to calculate $E_{np,n}$ in eV using the derived formula.\n    f. Compute the energy shift $\\Delta E_n = E_{np,n} - E_{p,n}$ in eV.\n    g. Round the final result for $\\Delta E_n$ to six decimal places as required.\nThis procedure will be implemented for all provided test cases to generate the final output.",
