            "solution": "The central concept for validating the provided statements is the definition of a Bravais lattice versus a lattice with a basis. A set of points $S$ constitutes a Bravais lattice if and only if for any two points $\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2 \\in S$, the environment around $\\mathbf{r}_1$ is identical in composition and orientation to the environment around $\\mathbf{r}_2$. This implies that there exists a group of translation vectors $L'$ such that any point in $S$ can be reached from any other point in $S$ by a translation from $L'$. Consequently, a Bravais lattice has exactly one site per primitive cell of its translation group. If the primitive cell contains more than one site, say $\\{\\mathbf{b}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{b}_m\\}$ with $m > 1$, then the structure is a lattice with a basis. The sites at $\\mathbf{b}_i$ and $\\mathbf{b}_j$ for $i \\neq j$ are inequivalent with respect to the translation group $L'$, and the overall structure is not a Bravais lattice.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on this principle.\n\n**A. If $S$ is invariant under $L'$ and there is exactly $1$ occupied site per primitive cell of $L'$, then $S$ is a Bravais lattice with primitive vectors given by the generators of $L'$.**\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe statement specifies that the set of occupied sites $S$ is invariant under the translations in $L'$. This means that for any site $\\mathbf{s} \\in S$ and any translation vector $\\mathbf{T} \\in L'$, the site $\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{T}$ is also in $S$. Thus, $L'$ is the translation group of the structure $S$. The statement further posits that there is exactly one occupied site per primitive cell of $L'$. Let the position of this single site within a given primitive cell be $\\mathbf{b}$. Then, by definition, the set of all sites in $S$ can be generated by acting on this single site with all translation vectors from the group $L'$. That is, $S = \\{\\mathbf{T} + \\mathbf{b} \\mid \\mathbf{T} \\in L'\\}$. This construction implies that starting from any site $\\mathbf{s}_1 = \\mathbf{T}_1 + \\mathbf{b} \\in S$, any other site $\\mathbf{s}_2 = \\mathbf{T}_2 + \\mathbf{b} \\in S$ can be reached by the translation $\\mathbf{T}_2 - \\mathbf{T}_1$, which is a vector in $L'$. All sites are therefore equivalent under the translations of $L'$. This is the definition of a Bravais lattice. The primitive vectors of this Bravais lattice are the generators of the translation group $L'$.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. If $S$ is invariant under $L'$ and the primitive cell of $L'$ contains $m>1$ occupied sites that are not related to each other by any translation in $L'$, then $S$ is not a Bravais lattice but rather a lattice with a basis of $m$.**\n\n**Analysis:**\nSimilar to the previous case, $L'$ is the translation group of the structure $S$. The primitive cell of $L'$ is defined as the minimal volume that tiles all of space under translations by vectors in $L'$. The statement says this primitive cell contains $m$ occupied sites, where $m>1$. Let these sites be located at positions $\\mathbf{b}_1, \\mathbf{b}_2, \\dots, \\mathbf{b}_m$ relative to the origin of the cell. Since they are all within one primitive cell, they cannot be related to each other by a non-zero translation vector from $L'$. The full set of sites $S$ is the union of $m$ interpenetrating lattices: $S = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{m} \\{\\mathbf{T} + \\mathbf{b}_i \\mid \\mathbf{T} \\in L'\\}$. Because there is more than one site in the primitive cell, not all sites in $S$ are equivalent under the translations of $L'$. For instance, a site at $\\mathbf{b}_1$ and a site at $\\mathbf{b}_2$ are crystallographically inequivalent. The structure is therefore not a Bravais lattice. It is, by definition, a lattice with a basis. The lattice is described by the translation group $L'$, and the basis is the set of $m$ sites $\\{\\mathbf{b}_1, \\mathbf{b}_2, \\dots, \\mathbf{b}_m\\}$ within the primitive cell.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. In a square lattice of lattice constant $a$, remove every site on one of the two checkerboard sublattices (i.e., remove all sites with $n_1+n_2$ odd when $\\mathbf{R}=n_1\\mathbf{a}_1+n_2\\mathbf{a}_2$, $\\mathbf{a}_1=a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\mathbf{a}_2=a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$). The remaining set $S$ is not a Bravais lattice because the nearest-neighbor environments of occupied sites alternate and are not all equivalent under translations.**\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe original lattice is $L = \\{n_1 a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_2 a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\mid n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. The remaining set of sites is $S = \\{n_1 a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_2 a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\mid n_1+n_2 \\text{ is even}\\}$. Let's examine the environment of an arbitrary site $\\mathbf{R}_0 = n_1^0 a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_2^0 a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\in S$. The nearest neighbors to $\\mathbf{R}_0$ in the original lattice $L$ were at vectors $\\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $\\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ away. These neighbors have integer index sums that differ by $\\pm 1$ from $n_1^0+n_2^0$. Since $n_1^0+n_2^0$ is even, these sums are odd, meaning all four nearest neighbors have been removed. The next-nearest neighbors in $L$ are at relative vectors $\\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. The new indices for a neighbor at $\\mathbf{R}_0 + a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ would be $(n_1^0+1, n_2^0+1)$, and their sum is $(n_1^0+n_2^0)+2$, which is also even. This is true for all four next-nearest neighbors. Thus, the nearest neighbors of any site in $S$ are located at the four relative positions $\\{\\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}, \\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\}$. Since this set of neighbor vectors is the same for every site in $S$, all sites in $S$ are equivalent. Therefore, $S$ is a Bravais lattice. The assertion that `S` is not a Bravais lattice is false. In fact, $S$ can be described by a new set of primitive vectors, for example $\\mathbf{A}_1 = a(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$ and $\\mathbf{A}_2 = a(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}-\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$. This is a square lattice rotated by $45^\\circ$ with a lattice parameter of $a\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. In a triangular lattice with primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}_1=a(1,0)$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2=a(1/2,\\sqrt{3}/2)$, remove every site with $n_1+n_2\\equiv 0\\ (\\mathrm{mod}\\ 3)$. The remaining occupied set $S$ is a Bravais lattice with primitive cell area increased by a factor of $3$.**\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe original lattice is $L = \\{n_1\\mathbf{a}_1+n_2\\mathbf{a}_2 \\mid n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. The sites in $S$ are those with $n_1+n_2 \\equiv 1 \\ (\\mathrm{mod}\\ 3)$ or $n_1+n_2 \\equiv 2 \\ (\\mathrm{mod}\\ 3)$. Let's call these \"type-1\" and \"type-2\" sites, respectively. We must check if type-1 and type-2 sites are equivalent.\nThe six nearest-neighbor vectors in the triangular lattice are $\\pm\\mathbf{a}_1$, $\\pm\\mathbf{a}_2$, and $\\pm(\\mathbf{a}_2-\\mathbf{a}_1)$. The corresponding changes in the index sum $n_1+n_2$ are $\\pm 1$, $\\pm 1$, and $0$.\nConsider a type-1 site $\\mathbf{R}_1$ (index sum $k_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$). Its neighbors' index sums are $\\{1\\pm 1, 1\\pm 1, 1\\pm 0\\} \\pmod 3$, which simplifies to $\\{2,0,2,0,1,1\\}$. The occupied neighbors are therefore two type-2 sites and two type-1 sites. The relative vectors to these occupied sites are $\\{\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2, \\mathbf{a}_2-\\mathbf{a}_1, -(\\mathbf{a}_2-\\mathbf{a}_1)\\}$.\nNow consider a type-2 site $\\mathbf{R}_2$ (index sum $k_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$). Its neighbors' index sums are $\\{2\\pm 1, 2\\pm 1, 2\\pm 0\\} \\pmod 3$, which simplifies to $\\{0,1,0,1,2,2\\}$. The occupied neighbors are two type-1 sites and two type-2 sites. The relative vectors to these occupied sites are $\\{-\\mathbf{a}_1, -\\mathbf{a}_2, \\mathbf{a}_2-\\mathbf{a}_1, -(\\mathbf{a}_2-\\mathbf{a}_1)\\}$.\nWhile both sites have the same number of type-1 and type-2 neighbors, the set of relative vectors pointing to them is different. The set of neighbor vectors for a type-1 site is not the same as the set for a type-2 site, and they are not related by a simple rotation. Therefore, the local environments are not identical, and the sites are inequivalent.\nSince $S$ contains two inequivalent types of sites, it is not a Bravais lattice. It is a lattice with a two-point basis (which forms the honeycomb structure). The assertion that $S$ is a Bravais lattice is false.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. In a body-centered cubic crystal with conventional cubic parameter $a$, removing all body-centered sites (keeping only the cube-corner sites) yields $S$ that is a Bravais lattice.**\n\n**Analysis:**\nA body-centered cubic (BCC) Bravais lattice can be viewed as two interpenetrating simple cubic (SC) lattices. One SC lattice has points at positions $n_1 a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_2 a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + n_3 a\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ for integers $n_i$. These are the \"cube-corner sites\". The second SC lattice is displaced by the vector $\\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$ and has points at $(n_1+\\frac{1}{2})a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (n_2+\\frac{1}{2})a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + (n_3+\\frac{1}{2})a\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. These are the \"body-centered sites\".\nThe problem describes removing all body-centered sites. The remaining set of sites, $S$, is precisely the set of cube-corner sites: $S = \\{n_1 a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_2 a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + n_3 a\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\mid n_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\nThis set $S$ is, by definition, a simple cubic Bravais lattice with lattice parameter $a$. In a simple cubic lattice, every site is equivalent under translations of the form $n_1 a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_2 a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + n_3 a\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. Therefore, $S$ is a Bravais lattice.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\nFinal summary: Statements A, B, and E are correct. Statements C and D are incorrect.",

Bravais Lattice and Crystal System Classification**\n\nThe classification depends on the relationships between the lattice parameters and interaxial angles.\n\nFor a generic shear where $s \\neq 0$:\nThe lattice parameters are $a' = a$, $b' = a\\sqrt{1+s^{2}}$, $c' = a$. Thus, $a'=c' \\neq b'$ (since $s \\neq 0$).\nThe interaxial angles are $\\alpha = 90^{\\circ}$, $\\beta = 90^{\\circ}$, and $\\gamma = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{1+s^{2}}}\\right) \\neq 90^{\\circ}$.\nThe conditions for the unit cell are $a' = c'$ and $\\alpha = \\beta = 90^{\\circ} \\neq \\gamma$. A crystal system with two right angles and one non-right angle is classified as **monoclinic**. The derived primitive vectors $(\\mathbf{a}_{1}', \\mathbf{a}_{2}', \\mathbf{a}_{3}')$ form a primitive unit cell. Therefore, the Bravais lattice is **simple monoclinic** (or monoclinic P).\n\nFor the special case where $s = 0$:\nThe deformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}(0)$ becomes the identity matrix, so the lattice is undeformed.\nThe lattice parameters become $a' = a$, $b' = a\\sqrt{1+0^{2}} = a$, $c' = a$. So, $a'=b'=c'=a$.\nThe interaxial angles become $\\alpha = 90^{\\circ}$, $\\beta = 90^{\\circ}$, and $\\cos\\gamma = \\frac{0}{\\sqrt{1+0^{2}}} = 0 \\implies \\gamma = 90^{\\circ}$. So, $\\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 90^{\\circ}$.\nThe conditions $a'=b'=c'$ and $\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=90^{\\circ}$ define the **cubic** crystal system. As the original lattice was simple cubic, the resulting Bravais lattice is **simple cubic** (P).\nThis confirms that the shear deformation transforms a simple cubic lattice into a simple monoclinic lattice.\n\n**4. Cosine of the Non-Right Interaxial Angle**\n\nAs determined in part 2 and 3, for any $s \\neq 0$, the angles $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are right angles ($90^{\\circ}$), while the angle $\\gamma$ is not. Therefore, $\\gamma$ is the only non-right interaxial angle.

            "solution": "The user wants to find the side length of the first Brillouin Zone (BZ) for a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice. The validation process confirms that the problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two main stages: first, determining the reciprocal lattice vectors from the direct lattice vectors, and second, using the geometry of the Wigner-Seitz cell of the reciprocal lattice to find the side length of the resulting hexagonal BZ.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Reciprocal Lattice Vectors**\n\nThe problem defines a 2D hexagonal Bravais lattice with primitive direct lattice vectors $\\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2$ such that their magnitudes are equal, $|\\mathbf{a}_1| = |\\mathbf{a}_2| = a$, and the angle between them is $\\gamma = 120^{\\circ}$.\n\nTo perform calculations, we first express these vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system. Let $\\mathbf{a}_1$ be aligned with the $x$-axis.\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_1 = a(1, 0) = (a, 0)\n$$\nThe vector $\\mathbf{a}_2$ is then at an angle of $120^{\\circ}$ with respect to $\\mathbf{a}_1$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_2 = a(\\cos(120^{\\circ}), \\sin(120^{\\circ})) = a(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = (-\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2})\n$$\n\nThe reciprocal lattice primitive vectors, $\\mathbf{b}_1$ and $\\mathbf{b}_2$, are defined by the relation $\\mathbf{a}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_j = 2\\pi \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Let the reciprocal vectors in the same Cartesian basis be $\\mathbf{b}_1 = (b_{1x}, b_{1y})$ and $\\mathbf{b}_2 = (b_{2x}, b_{2y})$. We can solve for their components using the four equations from the defining relation.\n\n1.  $\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1 = 2\\pi$:\n    $$\n    (a, 0) \\cdot (b_{1x}, b_{1y}) = a b_{1x} = 2\\pi \\implies b_{1x} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\n    $$\n2.  $\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2 = 0$:\n    $$\n    (a, 0) \\cdot (b_{2x}, b_{2y}) = a b_{2x} = 0 \\implies b_{2x} = 0\n    $$\n3.  $\\mathbf{a}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1 = 0$:\n    $$\n    (-\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}) \\cdot (b_{1x}, b_{1y}) = (-\\frac{a}{2}) b_{1x} + (\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}) b_{1y} = 0\n    $$\n    Substituting $b_{1x} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$:\n    $$\n    (-\\frac{a}{2}) (\\frac{2\\pi}{a}) + (\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}) b_{1y} = 0 \\implies -\\pi + \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2} b_{1y} = 0 \\implies b_{1y} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\n    $$\n4.  $\\mathbf{a}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2 = 2\\pi$:\n    $$\n    (-\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}) \\cdot (b_{2x}, b_{2y}) = (-\\frac{a}{2}) b_{2x} + (\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}) b_{2y} = 2\\pi\n    $$\n    Substituting $b_{2x} = 0$:\n    $$\n    0 + (\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}) b_{2y} = 2\\pi \\implies b_{2y} = \\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\n    $$\n\nCombining these components, we find the explicit expressions for the reciprocal lattice vectors:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_1 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_2 = \\left(0, \\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe reciprocal lattice of a hexagonal lattice is also a hexagonal lattice. To verify this, we calculate the magnitudes of $\\mathbf{b}_1$ and $\\mathbf{b}_2$ and the angle between them.\n$$\n|\\mathbf{b}_1|^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{a^2} + \\frac{4\\pi^2}{3a^2} = \\frac{12\\pi^2 + 4\\pi^2}{3a^2} = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^2}\n$$\n$$\n|\\mathbf{b}_2|^2 = 0^2 + \\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^2}\n$$\nThus, the magnitudes are equal: $|\\mathbf{b}_1| = |\\mathbf{b}_2| = \\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}$. Let's denote this common magnitude as $b$.\nThe angle $\\theta$ between $\\mathbf{b}_1$ and $\\mathbf{b}_2$ is given by:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{b}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2}{|\\mathbf{b}_1||\\mathbf{b}_2|} = \\frac{(2\\pi/a)(0) + (2\\pi/(a\\sqrt{3}))(4\\pi/(a\\sqrt{3}))}{16\\pi^2/(3a^2)} = \\frac{8\\pi^2/(3a^2)}{16\\pi^2/(3a^2)} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSo, the angle is $\\theta = 60^{\\circ}$. This confirms that the reciprocal lattice is also a hexagonal (triangular) lattice, with primitive vectors of length $b = \\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}$ and an inter-vector angle of $60^{\\circ}$.\n\n**Part 2: Geometry of the First Brillouin Zone**\n\nThe first Brillouin zone is defined as the Wigner-Seitz cell of the reciprocal lattice. It is the region of space closer to the origin (the $\\Gamma$ point) than to any other reciprocal lattice point. The BZ is therefore bounded by the planes (or lines in 2D) that are the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors from the origin to the nearest-neighbor reciprocal lattice points.\n\nThe nearest-neighbor reciprocal lattice points are those generated by the primitive vectors, such as $\\pm \\mathbf{b}_1$, $\\pm \\mathbf{b}_2$, and their sums/differences like $\\pm(\\mathbf{b}_1 - \\mathbf{b}_2)$. For the hexagonal lattice, there are six such nearest neighbors, all at the same distance $b = |\\mathbf{b}_1|$ from the origin. These six points form a regular hexagon. The perpendicular bisectors of the vectors to these six points form another regular hexagon centered at the origin, which is the first Brillouin zone.\n\nLet $L_{\\mathrm{BZ}}$ be the side length of this hexagonal Brillouin zone. The geometry of a regular hexagon relates its side length $L_{\\mathrm{BZ}}$ to the perpendicular distance $d$ from the center to the midpoint of a side. This relation is $d = L_{\\mathrm{BZ}} \\cos(30^\\circ) = L_{\\mathrm{BZ}} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nThe distance $d$ is precisely half the length of the vector connecting the origin to a nearest-neighbor reciprocal lattice point. Let's take any of a nearest neighbor vector, say $\\mathbf{G}$. The distance to this point is $|\\mathbf{G}| = b$. The perpendicular bisector line is at a distance $d = \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{G}| = \\frac{b}{2}$ from the origin.\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $d$, we can solve for $L_{\\mathrm{BZ}}$:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{BZ}} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{b}{2}\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{BZ}} = \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression we derived for $b$:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{BZ}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left( \\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}} \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{a(\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a}\n$$\nThis is the analytic expression for the side length of the first Brillouin zone. The units are reciprocal length, consistent with the space of wave vectors.",
