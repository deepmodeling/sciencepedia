The infinite potential well is a common and effective approximation for quantum dots. The Yukawa potential is the correct physical description for a screened electrostatic interaction in a medium with free carriers. Time-independent perturbation theory is the appropriate theoretical tool for calculating small energy shifts. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem statement clearly defines the unperturbed system, the perturbation, and the state of interest (non-degenerate ground state). It asks for a specific, calculable quantity ($E_g^{(1)}$) under well-defined limiting conditions ($\\lambda \\ll L$). All necessary information is provided. The problem is well-posed.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is phrased in precise, objective, and formal scientific language, free of any subjective or opinion-based claims.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The setup is self-contained and free of contradictions. The conditions provided ($\\lambda \\ll L$ and the impurity being far from boundaries) are consistent and crucial for simplifying the calculation.\n-   **Realism and Feasibility:** The physical scenario is a standard idealization used in the study of semiconductor nanostructures. The parameters are symbolic, so no inconsistency in their values can be assessed, but their physical definitions are correct.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be derived.\n\nThe first-order correction to the energy of a non-degenerate state $|\\psi_n^{(0)}\\rangle$ under a perturbation $H'$ is given by the expectation value of the perturbation in that state:\n$$E_n^{(1)} = \\langle \\psi_n^{(0)} | H' | \\psi_n^{(0)} \\rangle = \\int \\psi_n^{(0)\\ast}(\\mathbf{r}) H' \\psi_n^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d^3r$$\nFor this problem, the state of interest is the ground state, so we need the unperturbed ground-state wavefunction and the perturbation Hamiltonian.\n\nThe unperturbed system is a particle in a 3D infinite cubic well of side $L$. The time-independent Schrödinger equation is separable. The normalized energy eigenfunctions are:\n$$\\psi_{n_x,n_y,n_z}^{(0)}(x,y,z) = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\\right)^3 \\sin\\left(\\frac{n_x \\pi x}{L}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n_y \\pi y}{L}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n_z \\pi z}{L}\\right)$$\nwhere $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are positive integers. The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n$$E_{n_x,n_y,n_z}^{(0)} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2 m^\\ast L^2} (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)$$\nThe ground state corresponds to $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (1,1,1)$. For a cubic well ($L_x=L_y=L_z=L$), this state is non-degenerate. The unperturbed ground-state wavefunction, which we denote as $\\psi_g^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r})$, is real:\n$$\\psi_g^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\psi_{1,1,1}^{(0)}(x,y,z) = \\left(\\frac{8}{L^3}\\right)^{1/2} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{L}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi z}{L}\\right)$$\nThe perturbation Hamiltonian $H'$ is the given potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$H' = V(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\frac{\\exp(-|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0|/\\lambda)}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0|}$$\nThe first-order energy correction to the ground state, $E_g^{(1)}$, is therefore:\n$$E_g^{(1)} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\int_{0}^{L} |\\psi_g^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r})|^2 V(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d^3r$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $|\\psi_g^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r})|^2$ and $V(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$E_g^{(1)} = \\int_{\\text{box}} \\left[\\frac{8}{L^3} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{L}\\right) \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi z}{L}\\right)\\right] \\left[-\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\frac{\\exp(-|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0|/\\lambda)}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0|}\\right] \\, d^3r$$\nThe problem specifies the limit $\\lambda \\ll L$. The Yukawa potential term, $\\frac{\\exp(-|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0|/\\lambda)}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0|}$, is sharply peaked at $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_0$ and decays exponentially with a characteristic length $\\lambda$. In contrast, the wavefunction term, $|\\psi_g^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r})|^2$, varies on a length scale of order $L$. Since $\\lambda$ is much smaller than $L$, the function $|\\psi_g^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r})|^2$ is approximately constant over the small volume where the Yukawa potential is non-negligible. We can thus approximate its value within the integral by its value at the peak of the potential, $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_0$.\n$$|\\psi_g^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r})|^2 \\approx |\\psi_g^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r}_0)|^2 = \\frac{8}{L^3} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi x_0}{L}\\right) \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi y_0}{L}\\right) \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi z_0}{L}\\right)$$\nWe can factor this slowly varying term out of the integral:\n$$E_g^{(1)} \\approx -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} |\\psi_g^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r}_0)|^2 \\int_{\\text{box}} \\frac{\\exp(-|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0|/\\lambda)}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0|} \\, d^3r$$\nThe remaining integral is over the volume of the cubic box. The integrand is significant only in a small region of radius $\\sim \\lambda$ around $\\mathbf{r}_0$. The problem states that the impurity is located far from the boundaries, i.e., $|\\mathbf{r}_0 - \\partial\\Omega| \\gg \\lambda$. This condition ensures that the integration domain for the significant part of the integrand lies entirely within the box. Consequently, we can extend the limits of integration from the box to all of space ($\\mathbb{R}^3$) without introducing significant error.\nLet's define a new integration variable $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_0$. Then $d^3u = d^3r$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\frac{\\exp(-|\\mathbf{u}|/\\lambda)}{|\\mathbf{u}|} \\, d^3u $$\nTo evaluate this integral, we switch to spherical coordinates $(u, \\theta, \\phi)$, where $u = |\\mathbf{u}|$. The volume element is $d^3u = u^2 \\sin\\theta \\,du\\,d\\theta\\,d\\phi$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\exp(-u/\\lambda)}{u} u^2 \\,du $$\nThe angular integrals are standard: $\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi = 2\\pi$ and $\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta = 2$. Their product is $4\\pi$.\nThe radial integral is $\\int_0^\\infty u \\exp(-u/\\lambda) \\,du$. We can solve this using integration by parts. Let $v=u$ and $dw = \\exp(-u/\\lambda)du$. Then $dv=du$ and $w = -\\lambda\\exp(-u/\\lambda)$.\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty u \\exp(-u/\\lambda) \\,du = \\left[-u\\lambda \\exp(-u/\\lambda)\\right]_0^\\infty - \\int_0^\\infty (-\\lambda\\exp(-u/\\lambda))\\,du $$\nThe first term evaluates to $0$ at both limits. The second term becomes:\n$$ \\lambda \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-u/\\lambda)\\,du = \\lambda \\left[-\\lambda \\exp(-u/\\lambda)\\right]_0^\\infty = \\lambda(0 - (-\\lambda)) = \\lambda^2 $$\nThus, the value of the full spatial integral is $4\\pi \\lambda^2$.\n\nThis is the leading-order term in an expansion of the integral in powers of $\\lambda$. Higher-order terms, which would involve derivatives of the wavefunction density at $\\mathbf{r}_0$, would be proportional to $\\lambda^4$ and higher even powers of $\\lambda$.\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expression for $E_g^{(1)}$:\n$$E_g^{(1)} \\approx -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} |\\psi_g^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r}_0)|^2 (4\\pi \\lambda^2)$$\n$$E_g^{(1)} \\approx -\\frac{e^2 \\lambda^2}{\\varepsilon} |\\psi_g^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r}_0)|^2$$\nFinally, substituting the expression for $|\\psi_g^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r}_0)|^2$:\n$$E_g^{(1)} = -\\frac{e^2 \\lambda^2}{\\varepsilon} \\left[ \\frac{8}{L^3} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi x_0}{L}\\right) \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi y_0}{L}\\right) \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi z_0}{L}\\right) \\right]$$\nThis simplifies to the final analytical expression for the leading-order energy correction:\n$$E_g^{(1)} = -\\frac{8 e^2 \\lambda^2}{\\varepsilon L^3} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi x_0}{L}\\right) \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi y_0}{L}\\right) \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi z_0}{L}\\right)$$\nThis result is the leading order in $\\lambda$ (specifically, $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^2)$) and depends on the position of the impurity through the probability density of the unperturbed ground state at that location. The negative sign indicates that the attractive Coulomb potential lowers the ground state energy, as expected.",

            "solution": "The problem presents a two-level quantum mechanical system, which is a standard model for describing valley physics in certain nanoelectronic materials like silicon quantum wells. We are asked to analyze this system using both perturbation theory and exact diagonalization and then compare the results. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, we establish the matrix representation of the operators in the orthonormal basis $\\{|+\\rangle, |-\\rangle\\}$. The unperturbed Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{0}$ is diagonal in this basis, with its eigenvalues given as $E_{+}^{(0)} = E_{0} + \\Delta/2$ and $E_{-}^{(0)} = E_{0} - \\Delta/2$. The perturbation $\\hat{W}$ has off-diagonal elements $\\langle +|\\hat{W}|-\\rangle = V$ and $\\langle -|\\hat{W}|+\\rangle = V^{*}$. The diagonal elements are zero, i.e., $\\langle +|\\hat{W}|+\\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle -|\\hat{W}|-\\rangle = 0$.\n\nThe matrix representations are therefore:\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{0} = \\begin{pmatrix} E_{0} + \\frac{\\Delta}{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & E_{0} - \\frac{\\Delta}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{W} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & V \\\\ V^{*} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe total Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = \\hat{H}_{0} + \\hat{W}$.\n\n### Part 1: Perturbative Analysis\n\nWe apply time-independent non-degenerate perturbation theory, as the unperturbed energies $E_{+}^{(0)}$ and $E_{-}^{(0)}$ are distinct for $\\Delta > 0$.\n\nThe first-order energy corrections are given by the diagonal elements of the perturbation matrix. For the state $|+\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle$, these are:\n$$\nE_{+}^{(1)} = \\langle +|\\hat{W}|+\\rangle = 0\n$$\n$$\nE_{-}^{(1)} = \\langle -|\\hat{W}|-\\rangle = 0\n$$\n\nThe second-order energy corrections are calculated using the formula $E_{n}^{(2)} = \\sum_{k \\neq n} \\frac{|\\langle k^{(0)}|\\hat{W}|n^{(0)}\\rangle|^2}{E_{n}^{(0)} - E_{k}^{(0)}}$.\n\nFor the energy level $E_{+}$, the correction is:\n$$\nE_{+}^{(2)} = \\frac{|\\langle -|\\hat{W}|+\\rangle|^2}{E_{+}^{(0)} - E_{-}^{(0)}} = \\frac{|V^{*}|^{2}}{(E_{0} + \\Delta/2) - (E_{0} - \\Delta/2)} = \\frac{|V|^{2}}{\\Delta}\n$$\n\nFor the energy level $E_{-}$, the correction is:\n$$\nE_{-}^{(2)} = \\frac{|\\langle +|\\hat{W}|-\\rangle|^2}{E_{-}^{(0)} - E_{+}^{(0)}} = \\frac{|V|^{2}}{(E_{0} - \\Delta/2) - (E_{0} + \\Delta/2)} = \\frac{|V|^{2}}{-\\Delta} = -\\frac{|V|^{2}}{\\Delta}\n$$\n\nThe energy eigenvalues corrected to second order are:\n$$\nE_{+} \\approx E_{+}^{(0)} + E_{+}^{(1)} + E_{+}^{(2)} = E_{0} + \\frac{\\Delta}{2} + \\frac{|V|^{2}}{\\Delta}\n$$\n$$\nE_{-} \\approx E_{-}^{(0)} + E_{-}^{(1)} + E_{-}^{(2)} = E_{0} - \\frac{\\Delta}{2} - \\frac{|V|^{2}}{\\Delta}\n$$\n\nThe valley splitting predicted by second-order perturbation theory, $\\Delta_{\\text{pert}}$, is the difference between these corrected energies:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{pert}} = E_{+} - E_{-} = \\left(E_{0} + \\frac{\\Delta}{2} + \\frac{|V|^{2}}{\\Delta}\\right) - \\left(E_{0} - \\frac{\\Delta}{2} - \\frac{|V|^{2}}{\\Delta}\\right) = \\Delta + \\frac{2|V|^{2}}{\\Delta}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Exact Diagonalization\n\nTo find the exact energies, we find the eigenvalues of the full Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = \\hat{H}_{0} + \\hat{W}$:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\begin{pmatrix} E_{0} + \\frac{\\Delta}{2} & V \\\\ V^{*} & E_{0} - \\frac{\\Delta}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $E$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(\\hat{H} - E\\hat{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} E_{0} + \\frac{\\Delta}{2} - E & V \\\\ V^{*} & E_{0} - \\frac{\\Delta}{2} - E \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\left(E_{0} + \\frac{\\Delta}{2} - E\\right)\\left(E_{0} - \\frac{\\Delta}{2} - E\\right) - V V^{*} = 0\n$$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\left((E_{0} - E) + \\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right)\\left((E_{0} - E) - \\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right) - |V|^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(E_{0} - E)^{2} - \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right)^{2} - |V|^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(E - E_{0})^{2} = \\frac{\\Delta^{2}}{4} + |V|^{2}\n$$\n$$\nE - E_{0} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta^{2}}{4} + |V|^{2}}\n$$\nThe two exact energy eigenvalues are:\n$$\nE_{+}^{\\text{exact}} = E_{0} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta^{2}}{4} + |V|^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nE_{-}^{\\text{exact}} = E_{0} - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta^{2}}{4} + |V|^{2}}\n$$\nThe exact valley splitting $\\Delta_{\\text{exact}}$ is the difference between these exact energies:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{exact}} = E_{+}^{\\text{exact}} - E_{-}^{\\text{exact}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta^{2}}{4} + |V|^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\Delta^{2} + 4|V|^{2}}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Comparison of Perturbative and Exact Results\n\nTo compare $\\Delta_{\\text{exact}}$ with $\\Delta_{\\text{pert}}$, we expand $\\Delta_{\\text{exact}}$ in the small parameter $|V|/\\Delta \\ll 1$.\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{exact}} = \\sqrt{\\Delta^{2} + 4|V|^{2}} = \\Delta\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4|V|^{2}}{\\Delta^{2}}}\n$$\nLet $x = \\frac{4|V|^{2}}{\\Delta^{2}}$. We use the binomial series expansion $(1+x)^{1/2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{8}x^{2} + \\mathcal{O}(x^{3})$.\nSubstituting for $x$, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{exact}} = \\Delta\\left[1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{4|V|^{2}}{\\Delta^{2}}\\right) - \\frac{1}{8}\\left(\\frac{4|V|^{2}}{\\Delta^{2}}\\right)^{2} + \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\left(\\frac{|V|}{\\Delta}\\right)^{6}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{exact}} = \\Delta\\left[1 + \\frac{2|V|^{2}}{\\Delta^{2}} - \\frac{1}{8}\\left(\\frac{16|V|^{4}}{\\Delta^{4}}\\right) + \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{|V|^{6}}{\\Delta^{6}}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{exact}} = \\Delta + \\frac{2|V|^{2}}{\\Delta} - \\frac{2|V|^{4}}{\\Delta^{3}} + \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{|V|^{6}}{\\Delta^{5}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the difference $\\Delta_{\\text{exact}} - \\Delta_{\\text{pert}}$, keeping terms up to order $|V|^{4}$.\nWe have:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{pert}} = \\Delta + \\frac{2|V|^{2}}{\\Delta}\n$$\nThe difference is:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{exact}} - \\Delta_{\\text{pert}} = \\left(\\Delta + \\frac{2|V|^{2}}{\\Delta} - \\frac{2|V|^{4}}{\\Delta^{3}} + \\dots\\right) - \\left(\\Delta + \\frac{2|V|^{2}}{\\Delta}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{exact}} - \\Delta_{\\text{pert}} = -\\frac{2|V|^{4}}{\\Delta^{3}} + \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{|V|^{6}}{\\Delta^{5}}\\right)\n$$\nThe leading-order difference is the first non-zero term, which is of order $|V|^{4}$. This term is $-\\frac{2|V|^{4}}{\\Delta^{3}}$. All parameters are symbolic, so we provide the answer in this form. The units are consistent with energy, as required.",
