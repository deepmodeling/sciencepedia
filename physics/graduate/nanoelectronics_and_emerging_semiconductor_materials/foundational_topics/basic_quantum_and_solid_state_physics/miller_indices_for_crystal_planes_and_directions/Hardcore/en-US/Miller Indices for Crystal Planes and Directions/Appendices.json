Finding two minimal, non-collinear directions in the $(311)$ plane.**\nWe need to find two distinct, non-collinear sets of integers $(u, v, w)$ that satisfy $3u + v + w = 0$, have $\\gcd(u,v,w)=1$, and correspond to the shortest possible lattice vectors. The length squared of a direction vector $\\mathbf{r}$ is $|\\mathbf{r}|^2 = a^2(u^2+v^2+w^2)$. We seek to minimize $u^2+v^2+w^2$.\nWe search for integer solutions $(u,v,w)$ to $w = -3u - v$:\n- If $u=0$, then $w = -v$. To have minimal non-zero magnitude and $\\gcd(0,v,w)=1$, we choose $v=1$, which gives $w=-1$. This results in the direction $[01\\bar{1}]$. The length-squared term is $u^2+v^2+w^2 = 0^2+1^2+(-1)^2 = 2$. This is a shortest possible non-zero lattice vector in the plane. Let this be our first direction, $\\mathbf{d}_1 = [01\\bar{1}]$.\n\n- We now need a second direction, non-collinear with the first. We try $u=1$. The condition is $v+w = -3$. We seek the pair $(v,w)$ that minimizes $1^2+v^2+w^2$. This is equivalent to minimizing $v^2+w^2$ subject to $v+w=-3$. Pairs are $(0,-3), (-1,-2), (-2,-1), (-3,0)$.\n  - For $(v,w)=(0,-3)$, length-squared term is $1^2+0^2+(-3)^2 = 10$. Direction: $[10\\bar{3}]$.\n  - For $(v,w)=(-1,-2)$, length-squared term is $1^2+(-1)^2+(-2)^2 = 6$. Direction: $[1\\bar{1}\\bar{2}]$.\n  - For $(v,w)=(-2,-1)$, length-squared term is $1^2+(-2)^2+(-1)^2 = 6$. Direction: $[1\\bar{2}\\bar{1}]$.\nThe minimal length-squared term for $u \\neq 0$ is $6$. We choose one of these directions, for example, $\\mathbf{d}_2 = [1\\bar{2}\\bar{1}]$. Here, $\\gcd(1,-2,-1)=1$.\n\nThe two directions $\\mathbf{d}_1 = [01\\bar{1}]$ and $\\mathbf{d}_2 = [1\\bar{2}\\bar{1}]$ are non-collinear and represent the two shortest non-collinear lattice translation types in the $(311)$ plane. These will therefore span the parallelogram of smallest area, which corresponds to the primitive unit cell of the 2D lattice on this plane.\n\n**3. Explicit verification.**\nWe verify that both chosen directions satisfy the condition $3u+v+w=0$.\n- For direction $\\mathbf{d}_1 = [01\\bar{1}]$: $u=0, v=1, w=-1$.\n  $3(0) + (1) + (-1) = 0 + 1 - 1 = 0$. The condition is satisfied.\n- For direction $\\mathbf{d}_2 = [1\\bar{2}\\bar{1}]$: $u=1, v=-2, w=-1$.\n  $3(1) + (-2) + (-1) = 3 - 2 - 1 = 0$. The condition is satisfied.\n\n**4. Computation of the area.**\nThe area of the parallelogram is given by the magnitude of the cross product of the two vectors that span it. Let these vectors be $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2$, corresponding to directions $\\mathbf{d}_1$ and $\\mathbf{d}_2$.\n$$ \\mathbf{r}_1 = a(0\\,\\hat{x} + 1\\,\\hat{y} - 1\\,\\hat{z}) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{r}_2 = a(1\\,\\hat{x} - 2\\,\\hat{y} - 1\\,\\hat{z}) $$\nThe cross product is:\n$$ \\mathbf{r}_1 \\times \\mathbf{r}_2 = a^2 \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\hat{x} & \\hat{y} & \\hat{z} \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & -2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = a^2 (\\hat{x}(1(-1)-(-1)(-2)) - \\hat{y}(0(-1)-(-1)(1)) + \\hat{z}(0(-2)-1(1))) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{r}_1 \\times \\mathbf{r}_2 = a^2 (\\hat{x}(-1-2) - \\hat{y}(0+1) + \\hat{z}(0-1)) = a^2 (-3\\hat{x} - 1\\hat{y} - 1\\hat{z}) $$\nAs required, the resulting vector $(-3, -1, -1)$ is parallel to the plane normal $(3, 1, 1)$.\nThe area $A$ is the magnitude of this vector:\n$$ A = |\\mathbf{r}_1 \\times \\mathbf{r}_2| = |a^2 (-3\\hat{x} - 1\\hat{y} - 1\\hat{z})| = a^2 \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2} $$\n$$ A = a^2 \\sqrt{9 + 1 + 1} = a^2 \\sqrt{11} $$\nNow, we substitute the given value $a = 0.400$ nm:\n$$ A = (0.400 \\text{ nm})^2 \\sqrt{11} = 0.1600 \\times \\sqrt{11} \\text{ nm}^2 $$\nUsing the value $\\sqrt{11} \\approx 3.31662479$:\n$$ A \\approx 0.1600 \\times 3.31662479 \\text{ nm}^2 \\approx 0.53065996 \\text{ nm}^2 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ A \\approx 0.5307 \\text{ nm}^2 $$",
