The concept of a parabolic band approximation is a standard and valid model for electrons near the band edges in many semiconductors. The provided effective mass values are accepted experimental values for GaAs and for the conductivity effective mass in Si. The specified kinetic energy is physically reasonable. The nonrelativistic treatment is appropriate as the kinetic energy ($10$ meV) is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electron's rest mass energy ($\\approx 0.511$ MeV). The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information (kinetic energy, effective masses) and a clear physical model to calculate the requested de Broglie wavelengths. The question regarding physical implications is specific and has a definite, reasoning-based answer.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, formal language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution begins by relating the de Broglie wavelength of an electron to its momentum, and its momentum to its kinetic energy within the effective mass approximation.\n\nThe de Broglie wavelength, $\\lambda$, of a particle is given by the relation:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{h}{p} $$\nwhere $h$ is the Planck constant and $p$ is the magnitude of the particle's momentum.\n\nThe problem states that the electron's energy-momentum relationship (dispersion) can be modeled as parabolic, which is characteristic of a non-relativistic particle. For an electron in a semiconductor crystal, its kinetic energy $E$ is related to its crystal momentum $p$ by:\n$$ E = \\frac{p^2}{2m^{\\ast}} $$\nwhere $m^{\\ast}$ is the electron's effective mass in the crystal. This equation is a cornerstone of the effective mass approximation.\n\nBy rearranging the energy-momentum relation, we can express the momentum $p$ in terms of kinetic energy $E$ and effective mass $m^{\\ast}$:\n$$ p = \\sqrt{2m^{\\ast}E} $$\nSubstituting this expression for momentum into the de Broglie relation yields the formula for the wavelength as a function of energy and effective mass:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2m^{\\ast}E}} $$\nThis is the central equation we will use for the calculations.\n\nTo perform the numerical calculations, we need the values of the fundamental constants in SI units:\n- Planck constant, $h \\approx 6.62607 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$.\n- Free-electron mass, $m_{e} \\approx 9.10938 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg}$.\n- Elementary charge, $e \\approx 1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}$, which gives the conversion $1 \\text{ eV} \\approx 1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$.\n\nThe kinetic energy $E$ must be converted to SI units (Joules):\n$$ E = 10 \\text{ meV} = 10 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ eV} = 10^{-2} \\text{ eV} \\times \\left(\\frac{1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}}{1 \\text{ eV}}\\right) = 1.60218 \\times 10^{-21} \\text{ J} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the de Broglie wavelength for the electron in GaAs, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{GaAs}}$.\nThe effective mass in GaAs is $m^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} = 0.067\\,m_{e}$. In SI units:\n$$ m^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} = 0.067 \\times (9.10938 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg}) \\approx 6.10328 \\times 10^{-32} \\text{ kg} $$\nSubstituting the values into our derived equation for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} = \\frac{6.62607 \\times 10^{-34}}{\\sqrt{2 \\times (6.10328 \\times 10^{-32}) \\times (1.60218 \\times 10^{-21})}} \\text{ m} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} = \\frac{6.62607 \\times 10^{-34}}{\\sqrt{1.95560 \\times 10^{-52}}} \\text{ m} = \\frac{6.62607 \\times 10^{-34}}{1.39843 \\times 10^{-26}} \\text{ m} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} \\approx 4.7384 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m} $$\nConverting to nanometers and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} \\approx 47.38 \\text{ nm} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the de Broglie wavelength for the electron in Si, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{Si}}$.\nThe effective mass in Si is given as $m^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{Si}} = 0.26\\,m_{e}$. In SI units:\n$$ m^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{Si}} = 0.26 \\times (9.10938 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg}) \\approx 2.36844 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg} $$\nSubstituting the values into the equation for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{Si}} = \\frac{6.62607 \\times 10^{-34}}{\\sqrt{2 \\times (2.36844 \\times 10^{-31}) \\times (1.60218 \\times 10^{-21})}} \\text{ m} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{Si}} = \\frac{6.62607 \\times 10^{-34}}{\\sqrt{7.58913 \\times 10^{-52}}} \\text{ m} = \\frac{6.62607 \\times 10^{-34}}{2.75484 \\times 10^{-26}} \\text{ m} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{Si}} \\approx 2.4052 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m} $$\nConverting to nanometers and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{Si}} \\approx 24.05 \\text{ nm} $$\n\n**Comparison and Implications:**\n\nThe calculated de Broglie wavelengths are $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} \\approx 47.38$ nm and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{Si}} \\approx 24.05$ nm. For the same kinetic energy, the electron's wavelength in GaAs is nearly twice as long as in Si. This difference arises directly from the relationship $\\lambda \\propto 1/\\sqrt{m^{\\ast}}$; the significantly smaller effective mass of electrons in GaAs ($m^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{GaAs}}  m^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{Si}}$) results in a longer de Broglie wavelength.\n\nThis disparity in characteristic length scales has profound implications for nanoelectronic devices operating in the quantum regime:\n\n1.  **Quantum Confinement:** Quantum effects, such as the quantization of energy levels, become dominant when a particle is confined to a region with dimensions, $L$, comparable to or smaller than its de Broglie wavelength ($L \\lesssim \\lambda$). Because $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{GaAs}}$ is larger than $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{Si}}$, quantum confinement effects will manifest in GaAs-based nanostructures (e.g., quantum wells, nanowires) at significantly larger physical dimensions than in Si-based structures. For instance, a quantum well of width $L = 40$ nm would strongly confine a $10$ meV electron in GaAs ($\\lambda_{\\mathrm{GaAs}}  L$), leading to discrete energy states. In contrast, an electron in a Si well of the same width would be less strongly confined ($\\lambda_{\\mathrm{Si}}  L$), and its behavior would be closer to that of a classical particle in a bulk material.\n\n2.  **Quantum Interference:** Phenomena based on the wave nature of electrons, such as quantum interference, depend on the phase coherence of the electron's wavefunction over its path. The de Broglie wavelength sets the natural length scale for such interference. In devices where electrons traverse paths that split and recombine, interference patterns will be observable if the path length differences and the size of scattering features are on the order of $\\lambda$. The longer wavelength in GaAs means that devices designed to exploit interference (e.g., electron interferometers, Aharonov-Bohm rings) can be fabricated with larger, less-demanding dimensions compared to their Si counterparts.\n\nIn summary, the smaller effective mass in GaAs enhances the wave-like properties of electrons at a given energy. This makes it technologically easier to fabricate devices that exhibit quantum phenomena using GaAs and related III-V materials, as the critical dimensions for observing these effects are larger and thus less challenging from a lithography and fabrication standpoint. This property is a key reason why many pioneering quantum-effect and high-frequency devices have been realized in the GaAs material system.",

A single plane-wave component is described by the wavefunction $\\psi(x,t) = A \\exp[i(kx - \\omega t)]$, where $k$ is the wave number and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n\n**Phase Velocity ($v_p$)**\n\nThe phase velocity is the velocity at which a point of constant phase of a monochromatic wave propagates. The phase is given by $\\phi(x,t) = kx - \\omega t$. For a point of constant phase, $d\\phi = 0$.\n$$\nd\\phi = k \\, dx - \\omega \\, dt = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\omega}{k}\n$$\nBy definition, this is the phase velocity, $v_p$.\n$$\nv_p = \\frac{\\omega}{k}\n$$\nThe problem states that the time evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation, from which the relationship between angular frequency and energy is $\\omega = E(k)/\\hbar$. Substituting this into the expression for $v_p$ yields the general expression for phase velocity in terms of the energy dispersion:\n$$\nv_p = \\frac{E(k)/\\hbar}{k} = \\frac{E(k)}{\\hbar k}\n$$\nFor the specific case of a parabolic band, the dispersion relation is $E(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^{\\ast}}$. Substituting this into our expression for $v_p$:\n$$\nv_p = \\frac{1}{\\hbar k} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^{\\ast}} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar k}{2 m^{\\ast}}\n$$\n\n**Group Velocity ($v_g$)**\n\nThe group velocity is the velocity of the envelope of the wave packet, which is formed by the superposition of waves with slightly different wave numbers around a central value $k_0$. The group velocity corresponds to the velocity of energy and information transport and is identified with the particle's classical velocity. It is defined as the derivative of the angular frequency with respect to the wave number, evaluated at the central wave number of the packet.\n$$\nv_g = \\frac{d\\omega}{dk}\n$$\nUsing the relation $\\omega(k) = E(k)/\\hbar$, we obtain the general expression for the group velocity:\n$$\nv_g = \\frac{d}{dk}\\left(\\frac{E(k)}{\\hbar}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{dE(k)}{dk}\n$$\nNow, we specialize this to the parabolic band dispersion $E(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^{\\ast}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE(k)}{dk} = \\frac{d}{dk}\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^{\\ast}}\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m^{\\ast}}(2k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k}{m^{\\ast}}\n$$\nSubstituting this derivative back into the expression for $v_g$:\n$$\nv_g = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2 k}{m^{\\ast}}\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar k}{m^{\\ast}}\n$$\n\n**Distinction**\n\nThe **phase velocity**, $v_p = \\frac{\\hbar k}{2 m^{\\ast}}$, describes the propagation speed of the individual phase fronts of the constituent plane waves. For a dispersive medium, where $\\omega$ is not a linear function of $k$ (as is the case here, since $\\omega \\propto k^2$), the phase velocity depends on $k$ and does not represent the velocity of the particle itself.\n\nThe **group velocity**, $v_g = \\frac{\\hbar k}{m^{\\ast}}$, describes the propagation speed of the overall envelope of the wave packet. This velocity is associated with the transport of energy and represents the measurable velocity of the electron in the crystal.\n\nFor the parabolic band, we observe the relationship $v_g = 2v_p$. This non-equality of phase and group velocities is the defining characteristic of a dispersive medium.\n\n**2) Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the electron's kinetic energy $E = 0.100~\\mathrm{eV}$ and the effective mass $m^{\\ast} = 0.067\\,m_e$. We must compute $v_p$ and $v_g$. The derived velocity expressions are functions of $k$. First, we find the magnitude of the wave vector $k$ corresponding to the energy $E$ from the dispersion relation.\n$$\nE = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^{\\ast}} \\implies k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 m^{\\ast} E}}{\\hbar}\n$$\nWe can substitute this expression for $k$ into our velocity formulas to express them in terms of energy $E$.\n\nFor the group velocity:\n$$\nv_g = \\frac{\\hbar k}{m^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{m^{\\ast}} \\frac{\\sqrt{2 m^{\\ast} E}}{\\hbar} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 m^{\\ast} E}}{m^{\\ast}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 m^{\\ast} E}{(m^{\\ast})^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m^{\\ast}}}\n$$\nFor the phase velocity:\n$$\nv_p = \\frac{1}{2}v_g = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m^{\\ast}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E}{2m^{\\ast}}}\n$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values in SI units.\n*   $E = 0.100~\\mathrm{eV} = 0.100 \\times (1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19}~\\mathrm{J}) = 1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-20}~\\mathrm{J}$\n*   $m_e = 9.109\\,383\\,7015 \\times 10^{-31}~\\mathrm{kg}$\n*   $m^{\\ast} = 0.067 \\times m_e = 0.067 \\times (9.109\\,383\\,7015 \\times 10^{-31}~\\mathrm{kg}) \\approx 6.103\\,287\\,08 \\times 10^{-32}~\\mathrm{kg}$\n\nCalculate the group velocity $v_g$:\n$$\nv_g = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-20}~\\mathrm{J})}{6.103\\,287\\,08 \\times 10^{-32}~\\mathrm{kg}}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{3.204\\,353\\,268 \\times 10^{-20}}{6.103\\,287\\,08 \\times 10^{-32}}}~\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nv_g \\approx \\sqrt{5.250\\,169 \\times 10^{11}}~\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} \\approx 7.245\\,8047 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $v_g = 7.246 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nCalculate the phase velocity $v_p$:\n$$\nv_p = \\frac{1}{2}v_g \\approx \\frac{1}{2} (7.245\\,8047 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}) \\approx 3.622\\,9024 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $v_p = 3.623 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nThe final numerical values are $v_p = 3.623 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ and $v_g = 7.246 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.",

Equating the two expressions for $Z_{1}$ gives\n$$\n\\lambda_{T} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi m^{\\ast} k_{B} T}}.\n$$\nThis expression incorporates the effective mass $m^{\\ast}$ appropriate for semiconductor conduction electrons with parabolic dispersion.\n\nWe now evaluate $\\lambda_{T}$ numerically at $T = 4~\\mathrm{K}$ and $T = 300~\\mathrm{K}$, using the provided constants. First compute the effective mass:\n$$\nm^{\\ast} = 0.026\\, m_{e} = 0.026 \\times \\left(9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}~\\mathrm{kg}\\right) = 2.36843976239 \\times 10^{-32}~\\mathrm{kg}.\n$$\nThe thermal de Broglie wavelength is then\n$$\n\\lambda_{T} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi m^{\\ast} k_{B} T}}.\n$$\n\nAt $T = 300~\\mathrm{K}$,\n$$\nk_{B} T = \\left(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\right) \\times 300 = 4.141947 \\times 10^{-21}~\\mathrm{J},\n$$\n$$\n2 \\pi m^{\\ast} k_{B} T = 2 \\pi \\times \\left(2.36843976239 \\times 10^{-32}\\right) \\times \\left(4.141947 \\times 10^{-21}\\right) \\approx 6.163 \\times 10^{-52}~\\mathrm{kg\\cdot J},\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{2 \\pi m^{\\ast} k_{B} T} \\approx 2.483 \\times 10^{-26}~\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m/s},\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{T}(300~\\mathrm{K}) = \\frac{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}}{2.483 \\times 10^{-26}} \\approx 2.669 \\times 10^{-8}~\\mathrm{m} = 26.69~\\mathrm{nm}.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, $\\lambda_{T}(300~\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 26.7~\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nAt $T = 4~\\mathrm{K}$,\n$$\nk_{B} T = \\left(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\right) \\times 4 = 5.522596 \\times 10^{-23}~\\mathrm{J},\n$$\n$$\n2 \\pi m^{\\ast} k_{B} T = 2 \\pi \\times \\left(2.36843976239 \\times 10^{-32}\\right) \\times \\left(5.522596 \\times 10^{-23}\\right) \\approx 8.223 \\times 10^{-54}~\\mathrm{kg\\cdot J},\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{2 \\pi m^{\\ast} k_{B} T} \\approx 2.869 \\times 10^{-27}~\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m/s},\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{T}(4~\\mathrm{K}) = \\frac{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}}{2.869 \\times 10^{-27}} \\approx 2.309 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{m} = 230.9~\\mathrm{nm}.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, $\\lambda_{T}(4~\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 231~\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nQualitative assessment relative to device dimensions: At $T = 300~\\mathrm{K}$, $\\lambda_{T} \\approx 26.7~\\mathrm{nm}$ is comparable to the width $W = 30~\\mathrm{nm}$ and notably larger than the thickness $t = 10~\\mathrm{nm}$, indicating that wave effects such as transverse mode quantization and interference across the thickness are plausibly observable even near room temperature in sufficiently clean and coherent devices. At $T = 4~\\mathrm{K}$, $\\lambda_{T} \\approx 231~\\mathrm{nm}$ greatly exceeds both $W$ and $t$, strongly favoring observable wave phenomena, provided that scattering and dephasing are sufficiently suppressed. The final reported answer, as requested, consists only of the two numerical values of $\\lambda_{T}$ (in nanometers) for the two temperatures.",
