            "introduction": "This first exercise goes to the heart of the nearly free electron model: the opening of a band gap at the Brillouin zone boundary due to a weak periodic potential. We will move beyond simply stating the result and instead perform the foundational calculation, setting up the two-level Hamiltonian for nearly-degenerate plane waves. By solving this system, you will not only re-derive the expression for the energy gap but also determine the corresponding eigenstates, revealing how the periodic potential mixes the free electron states into standing waves .",

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional crystalline solid with lattice periodicity described by the scalar potential $V(x)=2 V_{G}\\cos(G x)$, where $V_{G}$ is a real, positive Fourier coefficient and $G>0$ is the magnitude of the smallest nonzero reciprocal lattice vector. Within the nearly free electron model, analyze electrons with wave vector $k$ near the first Bragg condition, writing $k = G/2 + q$ with $|q| \\ll G$. Work in the subspace spanned by the two plane waves $\\exp(i k x)$ and $\\exp(i (k-G) x)$ and neglect all other Fourier components. Starting from the single-electron time-independent Schrödinger equation and using only these two basis states, derive the normalized coefficients $c_{k}$ and $c_{k-G}$ of the higher-energy eigenstate (the upper branch) as exact functions of $q$, $V_{G}$, $G$, $m$, and $\\hbar$. Adopt the real gauge in which $c_{k}>0$. Then, briefly interpret how the mixing of the two plane-wave components evolves as $q$ varies through zero. Express your final answer as the ordered pair $\\left(c_{k},\\,c_{k-G}\\right)$ in closed form. No numerical evaluation is required, and no units should be included in the final pair.",
            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, representing a standard textbook application of the nearly free electron model in one dimension. We may proceed with a full derivation.\n\nThe single-electron time-independent Schrödinger equation is given by $\\hat{H}\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)$, where the Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = \\hat{T} + \\hat{V} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x)$. The periodic potential is given as $V(x) = 2V_G \\cos(Gx)$, which can be written in complex exponential form as $V(x) = V_G(e^{iGx} + e^{-iGx})$.\n\nThe problem restricts the analysis to the subspace spanned by the two plane-wave basis states $|k\\rangle \\equiv e^{ikx}$ and $|k-G\\rangle \\equiv e^{i(k-G)x}$. An arbitrary state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ in this subspace is a linear combination $|\\psi\\rangle = c_k|k\\rangle + c_{k-G}|k-G\\rangle$. The Schrödinger equation then becomes a matrix eigenvalue problem in this two-dimensional basis:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} H_{11} & H_{12} \\\\ H_{21} & H_{22} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_k \\\\ c_{k-G} \\end{pmatrix} = E \\begin{pmatrix} c_k \\\\ c_{k-G} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix elements are $H_{ij} = \\langle i | \\hat{H} | j \\rangle$, where the inner product involves an integral over the length of the crystal, which we can take to be $L$. For plane waves normalized as $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L}}e^{ikx}$, the inner product is $\\langle k'|k \\rangle = \\delta_{k,k'}$.\n\nThe diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian are:\n$H_{11} = \\langle k | \\hat{H} | k \\rangle = \\langle k | \\hat{T} | k \\rangle + \\langle k | V(x) | k \\rangle$.\nThe kinetic energy operator is diagonal in the plane-wave basis: $\\langle k | \\hat{T} | k \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \\equiv E_k^0$.\nThe potential energy term is $\\langle k | V_G(e^{iGx} + e^{-iGx}) | k \\rangle = 0$, because the integral of $e^{\\pm iGx}$ over the crystal length is zero.\nThus, $H_{11} = E_k^0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$.\nSimilarly, $H_{22} = \\langle k-G | \\hat{H} | k-G \\rangle = E_{k-G}^0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2 (k-G)^2}{2m}$.\n\nThe off-diagonal elements are:\n$H_{12} = \\langle k | \\hat{H} | k-G \\rangle = \\langle k | \\hat{T} | k-G \\rangle + \\langle k | V(x) | k-G \\rangle$.\nThe kinetic part is zero, $\\langle k | \\hat{T} | k-G \\rangle = 0$, since $k \\neq k-G$.\nThe potential part is $\\langle k | V_G(e^{iGx} + e^{-iGx}) | k-G \\rangle$. The only non-zero contribution comes from the $e^{iGx}$ term: $\\langle k | V_G e^{iGx} | k-G \\rangle = V_G \\langle k | k \\rangle = V_G$.\nThus, $H_{12} = V_G$.\nSince the Hamiltonian is Hermitian and $V_G$ is real, $H_{21} = H_{12}^* = V_G$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian matrix is:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} E_k^0 & V_G \\\\ V_G & E_{k-G}^0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe analyze the system near the first Brillouin zone boundary, parametrizing the wave vector $k$ as $k = G/2 + q$, where $|q| \\ll G$. The unperturbed energies are:\n$E_k^0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(\\frac{G}{2}+q\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(\\frac{G^2}{4} + Gq + q^2\\right)$.\n$E_{k-G}^0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(\\frac{G}{2}+q-G\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(-\\frac{G}{2}+q\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(\\frac{G^2}{4} - Gq + q^2\\right)$.\n\nIt is convenient to define the average energy $\\bar{E} = \\frac{E_k^0 + E_{k-G}^0}{2} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(\\frac{G^2}{4} + q^2\\right)$ and half the energy difference $\\delta E = \\frac{E_k^0 - E_{k-G}^0}{2} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 Gq}{2m}$.\nThen $E_k^0 = \\bar{E} + \\delta E$ and $E_{k-G}^0 = \\bar{E} - \\delta E$. The eigenvalue problem becomes:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} \\bar{E} + \\delta E - E & V_G \\\\ V_G & \\bar{E} - \\delta E - E \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nThis yields $(\\bar{E} - E)^2 - (\\delta E)^2 - V_G^2 = 0$, leading to the energy eigenvalues:\n$$\nE_{\\pm} = \\bar{E} \\pm \\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the higher-energy eigenstate (upper branch), which corresponds to the eigenvalue $E_+ = \\bar{E} + \\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2}$.\n\nTo find the eigenvector $\\begin{pmatrix} c_k & c_{k-G} \\end{pmatrix}^T$, we solve the system of linear equations $(H - E_+ I)c = 0$. Using the first row:\n$(\\bar{E} + \\delta E - E_+)c_k + V_G c_{k-G} = 0$.\nSubstituting $E_+$, we get $(\\delta E - \\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2})c_k + V_G c_{k-G} = 0$.\nAn unnormalized eigenvector can be written as:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} c_k \\\\ c_{k-G} \\end{pmatrix} \\propto \\begin{pmatrix} V_G \\\\ -(\\delta E - \\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} V_G \\\\ \\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2} - \\delta E \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAlternatively, using the second row gives an equivalent unnormalized vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2} + \\delta E \\\\ V_G \\end{pmatrix}$. This form is more convenient. Since $V_G>0$ and $\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2} \\ge |\\delta E|$, both components of this vector are positive. This automatically satisfies the real gauge condition $c_k > 0$.\n\nThe squared norm of this unnormalized eigenvector is:\n$N^{-2} = (\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2} + \\delta E)^2 + V_G^2 = (\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2 + 2\\delta E\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2} + (\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2$\n$N^{-2} = 2((\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2) + 2\\delta E\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2} = 2\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2}(\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2} + \\delta E)$.\nThe normalized coefficients are found by multiplying the unnormalized vector by $N=1/\\sqrt{N^{-2}}$.\n$$\nc_k = \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2} + \\delta E}{\\sqrt{2\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2}(\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2} + \\delta E)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2} + \\delta E}{2\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2}}}\n$$\n$$\nc_k = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\delta E}{\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2}}\\right)}\n$$\nAnd for the second coefficient:\n$$\nc_{k-G} = \\frac{V_G}{\\sqrt{2\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2}(\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2} + \\delta E)}}\n$$\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator inside the square root by $\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2} - \\delta E$:\n$$\nc_{k-G}^2 = \\frac{V_G^2 (\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2+V_G^2} - \\delta E)}{2\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2}((\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2 - (\\delta E)^2)} = \\frac{V_G^2 (\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2+V_G^2} - \\delta E)}{2\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2} V_G^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2+V_G^2} - \\delta E}{2\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2}}\n$$\n$$\nc_{k-G} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta E}{\\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2}}\\right)}\n$$\nWe take the positive root for $c_{k-G}$ because both components of our chosen unnormalized eigenvector were positive.\n\nSubstituting $\\delta E = \\frac{\\hbar^2 Gq}{2m}$, we obtain the final expressions for the coefficients in terms of the given parameters.\n\nInterpretation:\nAt the zone boundary ($q=0$), we have $\\delta E=0$. The coefficients become $c_k = c_{k-G} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. The eigenstate is an equal superposition of the two plane waves, resulting in a standing wave $\\psi_+(x) \\propto \\cos((G/2)x)$. This standing wave has its probability density maxima coinciding with the potential energy maxima of $V(x) = 2V_G \\cos(Gx)$, which is why it corresponds to the higher energy state.\nAs $q$ increases from $0$ (i.e., for $q>0$), $\\delta E > 0$. The ratio $\\delta E / \\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2}$ approaches $1$. Consequently, $c_k \\to 1$ and $c_{k-G} \\to 0$. The eigenstate increasingly resembles the pure plane wave $|k\\rangle=e^{ikx}$, which is the free-electron state with higher kinetic energy.\nAs $q$ becomes negative ($q<0$), $\\delta E < 0$. The ratio $\\delta E / \\sqrt{(\\delta E)^2 + V_G^2}$ approaches $-1$. Consequently, $c_k \\to 0$ and $c_{k-G} \\to 1$. The eigenstate increasingly resembles the pure plane wave $|k-G\\rangle=e^{i(k-G)x}$, which for $q<0$ is the free-electron state with higher kinetic energy.\nIn summary, the mixing of the two plane-wave components is maximal at the zone boundary ($q=0$) and decreases as $|q|$ increases. The upper-branch eigenstate smoothly transitions its character to match whichever of the two unperturbed plane-wave states has the higher kinetic energy.",

Thus, we approximate $E$ by $E_B$ in the energy denominator:\n$H_{eff} \\approx H_{PP} + H_{PQ}(E_B-H_{QQ})^{-1}H_{QP}$.\nThe matrix $(E_B-H_{QQ})^{-1}$ is:\n$$\n(E_B-H_{QQ})^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} E_B - 9E_B & 0 \\\\ 0 & E_B - 9E_B \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\frac{-1}{8E_B} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe second-order correction term is:\n$$\nH_{PQ}(E_B-H_{QQ})^{-1}H_{QP} = -\\frac{1}{8E_B} \\begin{pmatrix} V_{\\mathbf{G}} & V_{2\\mathbf{G}} \\\\ V_{2\\mathbf{G}} & V_{\\mathbf{G}} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} V_{\\mathbf{G}} & V_{2\\mathbf{G}} \\\\ V_{2\\mathbf{G}} & V_{\\mathbf{G}} \\end{pmatrix} = -\\frac{1}{8E_B} \\begin{pmatrix} V_{\\mathbf{G}}^2+V_{2\\mathbf{G}}^2 & 2V_{\\mathbf{G}}V_{2\\mathbf{G}} \\\\ 2V_{\\mathbf{G}}V_{2\\mathbf{G}} & V_{\\mathbf{G}}^2+V_{2\\mathbf{G}}^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe effective $2 \\times 2$ Hamiltonian is:\n$$\nH_{eff} = \\begin{pmatrix} E_B - \\frac{V_{\\mathbf{G}}^2+V_{2\\mathbf{G}}^2}{8E_B} & V_{\\mathbf{G}}-\\frac{2V_{\\mathbf{G}}V_{2\\mathbf{G}}}{8E_B} \\\\ V_{\\mathbf{G}}-\\frac{2V_{\\mathbf{G}}V_{2\\mathbf{G}}}{8E_B} & E_B - \\frac{V_{\\mathbf{G}}^2+V_{2\\mathbf{G}}^2}{8E_B} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of a matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ B & A \\end{pmatrix}$ are $E_{\\pm}=A \\pm B$.

These two states are coupled directly by $V_{2\\mathbf{G}}$ and indirectly through other states. The most significant indirect coupling is through the state $|k-\\mathbf{G}\\rangle=|0\\rangle$, which has energy $E_0(0)=0$.\nThe minimal basis to capture the physics is $\\{|-\\mathbf{G}\\rangle, |0\\rangle, |\\mathbf{G}\\rangle\\}$. The Hamiltonian matrix for this basis is:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} E_0(-\\mathbf{G}) & V_{\\mathbf{G}} & V_{2\\mathbf{G}} \\\\ V_{-\\mathbf{G}} & E_0(0) & V_{-\\mathbf{G}} \\\\ V_{-2\\mathbf{G}} & V_{\\mathbf{G}} & E_0(\\mathbf{G}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} E_1 & V_{\\mathbf{G}} & V_{2\\mathbf{G}} \\\\ V_{\\mathbf{G}} & 0 & V_{\\mathbf{G}} \\\\ V_{2\\mathbf{G}} & V_{\\mathbf{G}} & E_1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe partition this into a degenerate subspace $P=\\{|-\\mathbf{G}\\rangle, |\\mathbf{G}\\rangle\\}$ and a non-degenerate subspace $Q=\\{|0\\rangle\\}$.
