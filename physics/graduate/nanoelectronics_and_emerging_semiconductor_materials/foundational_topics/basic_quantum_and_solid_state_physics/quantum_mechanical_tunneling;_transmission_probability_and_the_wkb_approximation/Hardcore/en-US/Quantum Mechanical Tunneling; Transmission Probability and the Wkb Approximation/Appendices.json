This exercise provides a unique opportunity to benchmark the WKB method against an exact quantum mechanical solution for the inverted parabolic barrier, a common model for smooth potentials in nanostructures.

Near the barrier maximum at $x=0$, the potential can be approximated by an inverted harmonic parabola $V(x)=V_0-\\frac{1}{2} m^{\\ast} \\omega^2 x^2$, where $V_0$ is the barrier height and $\\omega$ characterizes the local curvature at the top. For an incident energy $E$ with $0EV_0$ in the regime of a moderate barrier ($V_0-E$ small but nonzero), you will compare the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) approximation to the exact quantum mechanical transmission.\n\nStarting from the time-independent Schrödinger equation and the core definition of the WKB approximation, derive the under-barrier action $S(E)=\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\kappa(x)\\,dx$ where $\\kappa(x)=\\sqrt{2 m^{\\ast} \\left(V(x)-E\\right)}/\\hbar$ and $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the classical turning points satisfying $V(x)=E$. Use this to obtain the naive WKB transmission $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E)$ for $EV_0$.\n\nNext, compare $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E)$ to the exact transmission $T_{\\mathrm{exact}}(E)$ for the inverted parabolic barrier obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation via parabolic cylinder functions (you may use the known, well-tested closed form for this barrier without deriving it).

Uniform semiclassical approximations correct this by yielding a formula valid through the transition, which for a smooth symmetric barrier is $T_{\\mathrm{corr}}(E) = [1 + \\exp(2S(E))]^{-1}$. Remarkably, for the parabolic barrier, this corrected WKB formula is identical to the exact quantum mechanical result, removing the error completely.\n\nThe only quantity required for the final answer is the expression for the relative error $\\varepsilon(E)$.",

The core of the analysis requires comparing the exact quantum mechanical solution to the result of the WKB approximation.\n\nFirst, let us establish the exact solution for the given system. The governing equation is the position-dependent effective-mass Schrödinger equation. For a sharp interface at $x=0$ with $E > V_0$, the solutions are plane waves in each region.

The WKB method is valid only when the potential varies slowly, a condition formalized as $|\\partial_x k(x)| \\ll k(x)^2$. At a sharp interface, the local wave number $k(x)$ is discontinuous, and its derivative is a Dirac delta function, catastrophically violating the validity condition. In a classically allowed region with no turning points, the lowest-order WKB approximation describes adiabatic propagation without reflection. Therefore, a naive application of the WKB method across the sharp step would yield a reflection coefficient of approximately zero ($R_{WKB} \\approx 0$).
