            "introduction": "A critical skill in theoretical physics is not just applying an approximation, but also understanding its accuracy and limitations. The inverted parabolic barrier offers a perfect testbed for the WKB method, as it is one of the few potentials for which both the semiclassical approximation and the exact Schrödinger equation are analytically solvable. This practice  challenges you to derive the WKB transmission probability and compare it directly to the exact result, allowing you to quantify the error and appreciate how uniform approximations can correct the naive formula, especially near the top of the barrier.",

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional electron with effective mass $m^{\\ast}$ moving in an emerging two-dimensional semiconductor heterostructure where transport across a constriction is dominated by tunneling near a smooth saddle-point barrier. Near the barrier maximum at $x=0$, the potential can be approximated by an inverted harmonic parabola $V(x)=V_0-\\frac{1}{2} m^{\\ast} \\omega^2 x^2$, where $V_0$ is the barrier height and $\\omega$ characterizes the local curvature at the top. For an incident energy $E$ with $0EV_0$ in the regime of a moderate barrier ($V_0-E$ small but nonzero), you will compare the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) approximation to the exact quantum mechanical transmission.\n\nStarting from the time-independent Schrödinger equation and the core definition of the WKB approximation, derive the under-barrier action $S(E)=\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\kappa(x)\\,dx$ where $\\kappa(x)=\\sqrt{2 m^{\\ast} \\left(V(x)-E\\right)}/\\hbar$ and $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the classical turning points satisfying $V(x)=E$. Use this to obtain the naive WKB transmission $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E)$ for $EV_0$.\n\nNext, compare $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E)$ to the exact transmission $T_{\\mathrm{exact}}(E)$ for the inverted parabolic barrier obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation via parabolic cylinder functions (you may use the known, well-tested closed form for this barrier without deriving it). In the stated moderate-barrier regime, quantify the error by deriving the closed-form expression for the dimensionless relative error\n$$\\varepsilon(E)=\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E)-T_{\\mathrm{exact}}(E)}{T_{\\mathrm{exact}}(E)}.$$\n\nFinally, discuss qualitatively how corrections to the WKB prefactor arising from uniform semiclassical approximations and proper connection formulas near the coalescing turning points modify $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E)$ to remove the leading-order error close to the barrier top.

The only quantity you must report as your final answer is the analytical expression for $\\varepsilon(E)$; it should be a single closed-form expression with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is a well-defined exercise in quantum mechanics, specifically concerning the application and limitations of the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) approximation for tunneling through a parabolic potential barrier. All provided information is scientifically sound, self-contained, and logically consistent. The potential $V(x)=V_0-\\frac{1}{2} m^{\\ast} \\omega^2 x^2$ is a canonical model for which both an exact solution and a WKB approximation can be found, allowing for a direct comparison. The problem is therefore valid. We proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe first step is to derive the under-barrier action, defined as $S(E)=\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\kappa(x)\\,dx$, where $\\kappa(x)=\\sqrt{2 m^{\\ast} \\left(V(x)-E\\right)}/\\hbar$. The classical turning points, $x_1$ and $x_2$, are the roots of the equation $V(x) = E$.\n$$V_0 - \\frac{1}{2} m^{\\ast} \\omega^2 x^2 = E$$\n$$x^2 = \\frac{2(V_0 - E)}{m^{\\ast} \\omega^2}$$\nThe turning points are therefore $x_{1,2} = \\mp \\sqrt{\\frac{2(V_0 - E)}{m^{\\ast} \\omega^2}}$. Let us denote the positive turning point as $a = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(V_0 - E)}{m^{\\ast} \\omega^2}}$, so $x_1 = -a$ and $x_2 = a$.\n\nThe action integral $S(E)$ is given by:\n$$S(E) = \\int_{-a}^{a} \\frac{\\sqrt{2 m^{\\ast} \\left(V_0 - \\frac{1}{2} m^{\\ast} \\omega^2 x^2 - E\\right)}}{\\hbar} \\,dx$$\nWe can factor out terms from the square root:\n$$S(E) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\int_{-a}^{a} \\sqrt{2 m^{\\ast} (V_0 - E) - m^{\\ast 2} \\omega^2 x^2} \\,dx$$\n$$S(E) = \\frac{m^{\\ast} \\omega}{\\hbar} \\int_{-a}^{a} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 m^{\\ast} (V_0 - E)}{m^{\\ast 2} \\omega^2} - x^2} \\,dx$$\nRecognizing that $a^2 = \\frac{2(V_0 - E)}{m^{\\ast} \\omega^2}$, the integral simplifies to:\n$$S(E) = \\frac{m^{\\ast} \\omega}{\\hbar} \\int_{-a}^{a} \\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} \\,dx$$\nThe integral $\\int_{-a}^{a} \\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} \\,dx$ represents the area of a semicircle of radius $a$, which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi a^2$.\nSubstituting the expression for $a^2$:\n$$\\int_{-a}^{a} \\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} \\,dx = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi a^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi \\left(\\frac{2(V_0 - E)}{m^{\\ast} \\omega^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi (V_0 - E)}{m^{\\ast} \\omega^2}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $S(E)$:\n$$S(E) = \\frac{m^{\\ast} \\omega}{\\hbar} \\left( \\frac{\\pi (V_0 - E)}{m^{\\ast} \\omega^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi (V_0 - E)}{\\hbar \\omega}$$\n\nThe naive WKB transmission probability for tunneling under a barrier is given by $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E) \\approx \\exp(-2S(E))$. Using the derived action:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E) = \\exp\\left(-2 \\frac{\\pi (V_0 - E)}{\\hbar \\omega}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we compare this to the exact transmission probability for the inverted parabolic barrier. As permitted, we use the known result, which is derived by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation with this potential. The exact solution is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{exact}}(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(2 \\pi \\frac{V_0 - E}{\\hbar \\omega}\\right)}$$\nFor convenience, let's use the expression for the action $S(E)$ derived earlier. The exact transmission can be written as:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{exact}}(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(2S(E))}$$\n\nNow, we derive the dimensionless relative error $\\varepsilon(E)$:\n$$\\varepsilon(E) = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E) - T_{\\mathrm{exact}}(E)}{T_{\\mathrm{exact}}(E)} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E)}{T_{\\mathrm{exact}}(E)} - 1$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E)$ and $T_{\\mathrm{exact}}(E)$:\n$$\\varepsilon(E) = \\frac{\\exp(-2S(E))}{\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(2S(E))}\\right)} - 1$$\n$$\\varepsilon(E) = \\exp(-2S(E))\\left(1 + \\exp(2S(E))\\right) - 1$$\n$$\\varepsilon(E) = \\exp(-2S(E)) + \\exp(-2S(E))\\exp(2S(E)) - 1$$\n$$\\varepsilon(E) = \\exp(-2S(E)) + 1 - 1 = \\exp(-2S(E))$$\nFinally, substituting back the full expression for $S(E)$:\n$$\\varepsilon(E) = \\exp\\left(-2\\pi \\frac{V_0 - E}{\\hbar \\omega}\\right) = \\exp\\left(2\\pi \\frac{E - V_0}{\\hbar \\omega}\\right)$$\nThis expression quantifies the error. In the regime where the WKB approximation is typically considered valid ($V_0 - E \\gg \\hbar\\omega$, so $S(E) \\gg 1$), the error $\\varepsilon(E)$ is exponentially small. However, in the specified \"moderate-barrier regime\" where $V_0 - E$ is small, $S(E)$ approaches $0$, and $\\varepsilon(E)$ approaches $1$, indicating a large relative error of $100\\%$ at the barrier top ($E=V_0$), where $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}} \\to 1$ while $T_{\\mathrm{exact}} \\to 1/2$.\n\nThe last part of the problem asks for a qualitative discussion on correcting the WKB formula. The naive formula $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E) = \\exp(-2S(E))$ arises from considering only the exponential decay of the wavefunction under the barrier and assumes the turning points are well-separated. This assumption fails as $E \\to V_0$, where the turning points $x_1$ and $x_2$ coalesce at $x=0$.\nUniform semiclassical approximations are designed to be valid even near turning points. A more careful application of connection formulas, or methods like the Miller-Good transformation, leads to a uniform approximation for transmission through a smooth barrier, which is given by $T = [1 + \\exp(2S)]^{-1}$. This expression correctly interpolates between the tunneling ($EV_0$) and over-barrier reflection ($EV_0$) regimes.\n\nThe corrected semiclassical transmission probability, $T_{\\mathrm{corr}}(E)$, is therefore:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{corr}}(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(2S(E))} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(2\\pi \\frac{V_0-E}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right)}$$\nA remarkable feature of the parabolic barrier is that this uniform semiclassical approximation is identical to the exact quantum mechanical result, $T_{\\mathrm{corr}}(E) = T_{\\mathrm{exact}}(E)$. Therefore, for this specific potential, the corrected WKB method removes the error completely, yielding the exact answer. The leading-order error of the naive approximation is corrected by including the full geometric series resummation $e^{-2S} - e^{-4S} + \\dots = (1+e^{2S})^{-1}$, which is what the uniform approximation effectively does.\n\nThe only quantity required for the final answer is the expression for the relative error $\\varepsilon(E)$.",
