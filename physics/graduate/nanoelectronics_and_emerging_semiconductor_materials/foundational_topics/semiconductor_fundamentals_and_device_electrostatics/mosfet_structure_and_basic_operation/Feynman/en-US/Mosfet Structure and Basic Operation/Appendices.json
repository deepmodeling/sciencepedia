A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Saturation Current Model**\n\nThe drain current $I_D$ in an $n$-channel MOSFET is due to the drift of electrons in the inversion layer. The drift current at any point $x$ along the channel (from source at $x=0$ to drain at $x=L$) is given by the product of the channel width $W$, the mobile inversion charge density per unit area $|Q_{inv}(x)|$, and the electron drift velocity $v_d(x)$. For a long-channel device with a constant low-field mobility $\\mu$, the drift velocity is $v_d(x) = \\mu E(x) = \\mu \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$, where $V(x)$ is the channel potential.\n\n$$I_D = W |Q_{inv}(x)| \\mu \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$$\n\nUnder the gradual-channel approximation, the inversion charge density is controlled by the local gate-to-channel potential difference, $|Q_{inv}(x)| = C_{ox}(V_G - V_T - V(x))$. Substituting this into the current equation gives:\n\n$$I_D = W \\mu C_{ox} (V_G - V_T - V(x)) \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$$\n\nSince the current $I_D$ must be constant along the channel in steady state, we can integrate this expression from the source ($x=0$, $V(0)=0$) to the drain ($x=L$, $V(L)=V_D$):\n\n$$I_D \\int_{0}^{L} dx = W \\mu C_{ox} \\int_{0}^{V_D} (V_G - V_T - V) dV$$\n\nPerforming the integration yields the general I-V characteristic for the linear (triode) region:\n\n$$I_D L = W \\mu C_{ox} \\left[ (V_G - V_T)V - \\frac{1}{2}V^2 \\right]_{0}^{V_D}$$\n$$I_D = \\frac{\\mu C_{ox} W}{L} \\left[ (V_G - V_T)V_D - \\frac{1}{2}V_D^2 \\right]$$\n\nSaturation begins when the channel is \"pinched off\" at the drain end, which occurs when the local inversion charge tends to zero. This happens at a drain voltage $V_D = V_{D,sat}$ such that $V_G - V_T - V_{D,sat} = 0$. Thus, the saturation drain voltage is $V_{D,sat} = V_G - V_T$. The ideal saturation current, $I_{D,sat}$, is found by substituting $V_D = V_{D,sat}$ into the linear-region equation:\n\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{\\mu C_{ox} W}{L} \\left[ (V_G - V_T)(V_G - V_T) - \\frac{1}{2}(V_G - V_T)^2 \\right]$$\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_G - V_T)^2$$\n\nThis expression can be written in terms of the source-end inversion charge density, $|Q_{inv}(x=0)| = C_{ox}(V_G - V_T)$, as $I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{W}{L} \\mu |Q_{inv}(0)| (V_G - V_T)$.\n\nFor $V_D  V_{D,sat}$, the pinch-off point moves from $x=L$ towards the source to a new position $L_{eff}  L$. The current is now determined by this effective channel length $L_{eff}$. The standard first-order model for channel-length modulation (CLM) approximates the drain current in saturation as:\n\n$$I_D(V_D) = I_{D,sat} (1 + \\lambda V_D) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_G - V_T)^2 (1 + \\lambda V_D)$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the empirical channel-length modulation parameter.\n\n**Part 1: Ideal Saturation Current Calculation**\n\nWe calculate the ideal saturation current $I_{D,ideal}$ assuming no channel-length modulation ($\\lambda=0$) and using the nominal mobility $\\mu_0$. The required parameters are:\n- $\\mu_0 = 50\\ \\mathrm{cm^2/(V \\cdot s)} = 50 \\times (10^{-2})^2\\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V \\cdot s)} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V \\cdot s)}$\n- $C_{ox} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{F/m^2}$\n- $W = 0.80\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.80 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $L = 0.24\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.24 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $V_G - V_T = 1.10\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.35\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.75\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n\nThe aspect ratio is $\\frac{W}{L} = \\frac{0.80 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{0.24 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{10}{3}$.\nIn the ideal saturation model, the current is independent of $V_D$ for $V_D \\ge V_{D,sat}$. We compute $I_{D,ideal}$ at $V_D = 0.80\\ \\mathrm{V}$:\n\n$$I_{D,ideal} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{0} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_G - V_T)^2$$\n$$I_{D,ideal} = \\frac{1}{2} (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (1.20 \\times 10^{-2}) \\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right) (0.75)^2$$\n$$I_{D,ideal} = (2.5 \\times 10^{-3}) (1.20 \\times 10^{-2}) \\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right) (0.5625)$$\n$$I_{D,ideal} = 5.625 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{A} = 56.25\\ \\mu\\mathrm{A}$$\n\n**Part 2: Extraction of Mobility ($\\mu$) and CLM Parameter ($\\lambda$)**\n\nWe use the full saturation model including CLM and the two experimental data points to find the actual mobility $\\mu$ and the parameter $\\lambda$. Let $I_{D0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_G - V_T)^2$. The model is $I_D(V_D) = I_{D0}(1 + \\lambda V_D)$.\n\nThe two data points yield a system of two equations:\n1. $54.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{A} = I_{D0}(1 + \\lambda \\cdot 0.80)$\n2. $60.75 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{A} = I_{D0}(1 + \\lambda \\cdot 1.40)$\n\nDivide equation (2) by equation (1) to eliminate $I_{D0}$:\n\n$$\\frac{60.75}{54.0} = \\frac{1 + 1.40\\lambda}{1 + 0.80\\lambda}$$\n$$1.125 = \\frac{1 + 1.40\\lambda}{1 + 0.80\\lambda}$$\n\nSolving for $\\lambda$:\n\n$$1.125(1 + 0.80\\lambda) = 1 + 1.40\\lambda$$\n$$1.125 + 0.90\\lambda = 1 + 1.40\\lambda$$\n$$0.125 = 0.50\\lambda$$\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{0.125}{0.50} = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{V^{-1}}$$\n\nNow, substitute $\\lambda$ back into equation (1) to find $I_{D0}$:\n\n$$54.0 \\times 10^{-6} = I_{D0}(1 + 0.25 \\cdot 0.80) = I_{D0}(1 + 0.20) = 1.20 I_{D0}$$\n$$I_{D0} = \\frac{54.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.20} = 45.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{A}$$\n\nFinally, we extract the actual mobility $\\mu$ from the definition of $I_{D0}$:\n\n$$I_{D0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_G - V_T)^2$$\n$$45.0 \\times 10^{-6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu (1.20 \\times 10^{-2}) \\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right) (0.75)^2$$\n$$45.0 \\times 10^{-6} = \\mu \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (1.20 \\times 10^{-2}) \\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right) (0.5625) \\right]$$\n$$45.0 \\times 10^{-6} = \\mu [1.125 \\times 10^{-2}]$$\n\nSolving for $\\mu$ in SI units ($\\mathrm{m^2/(V \\cdot s)}$):\n\n$$\\mu = \\frac{45.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.125 \\times 10^{-2}} = 40.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V \\cdot s)}$$\n\nThe problem requests the mobility in units of $\\mathrm{cm^2/(V \\cdot s)}$.

The problem is objective, free of ambiguity, and contains no internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation of transconductance, $g_m$, and its subsequent use to find the parameters $\\eta$ and $r$.\n\nFirst, we must select a specific mathematical form for the velocity-field relation, $v(E)$, that is consistent with the problem's requirements: it must be monotonic, approach the linear relation $v(E) \\approx \\mu_{0} E$ for low fields ($E \\to 0$), and saturate for high fields. The simplest and most commonly used model that satisfies these conditions is the Sah model:\n$$v(E) = \\frac{\\mu_{0} E}{1 + \\frac{E}{E_{\\text{sat}}}}$$\nThis expression correctly reduces to $v(E) \\approx \\mu_0 E$ when $E \\ll E_{\\text{sat}}$ and approaches a constant saturation velocity $v_{\\text{sat}} = \\mu_0 E_{\\text{sat}}$ when $E \\gg E_{\\text{sat}}$.\n\nThe drain current $I_{D}$ is given by the drift-current expression:\n$$I_{D} = W Q_{\\text{inv}} v(E)$$\nSubstituting the strong inversion charge control model, $Q_{\\text{inv}} = C_{\\text{ox}}(V_G-V_T)$, and the chosen velocity-field relation, we get:\n$$I_{D} = W C_{\\text{ox}}(V_G-V_T) \\frac{\\mu_{0} E}{1 + \\frac{E}{E_{\\text{sat}}}}$$\nThe transconductance, $g_m$, is defined as the partial derivative of $I_D$ with respect to $V_G$ at a fixed drain voltage $V_D$:\n$$g_{m} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{G}}$$\nThe average electric field $E$ is approximated as $E \\approx V_{D}/L$. Since $V_D$ and $L$ are constants for this derivative, $E$ is also treated as a constant. The terms $W$, $C_{\\text{ox}}$, $V_T$, $\\mu_0$, and $E_{\\text{sat}}$ are also constant. Differentiating the expression for $I_D$ with respect to $V_G$ yields:\n$$g_{m} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{G}} \\left[ W C_{\\text{ox}}(V_{G}-V_{T}) \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{0} E}{1 + E/E_{\\text{sat}}} \\right) \\right]$$\n$$g_{m} = W C_{\\text{ox}} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{0} E}{1 + E/E_{\\text{sat}}} \\right)$$\nThis is the general expression for transconductance under the given model, including high-field velocity saturation effects.\n\nNext, we determine the low-field transconductance, $g_{m,0}$. This corresponds to the limit where $E \\ll E_{\\text{sat}}$, which means $E/E_{\\text{sat}} \\to 0$. In this limit, the velocity is simply $v(E) \\approx \\mu_0 E$. The drain current becomes:\n$$I_{D,0} = W C_{\\text{ox}}(V_G-V_T) \\mu_{0} E$$\nThe low-field transconductance is then:\n$$g_{m,0} = \\frac{\\partial I_{D,0}}{\\partial V_{G}} = W C_{\\text{ox}} \\mu_{0} E$$\nThis result can also be obtained by taking the limit of the general $g_m$ expression as $E/E_{\\text{sat}} \\to 0$.\n\nNow we can compute the dimensionless onset parameter $\\eta \\equiv E/E_{\\text{sat}}$. Using the approximation $E \\approx V_D/L$:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{E}{E_{\\text{sat}}} = \\frac{V_D/L}{E_{\\text{sat}}} = \\frac{V_D}{L E_{\\text{sat}}}$$\nBefore substituting the numerical values, we must ensure consistent units. We will use the International System of Units (SI).\nGiven:\n$V_D = 0.700$ V.\n$L = 50$ nm $= 50 \\times 10^{-9}$ m.\n$E_{\\text{sat}} = 1.00 \\times 10^5$ V/cm. To convert to V/m, we use $1$ m $= 100$ cm, so $E_{\\text{sat}} = 1.00 \\times 10^5 \\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{cm}} \\times \\frac{100 \\text{ cm}}{1 \\text{ m}} = 1.00 \\times 10^7$ V/m.\nNow, we compute $\\eta$:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{0.700 \\, \\text{V}}{(50 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}) (1.00 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{V/m})} = \\frac{0.700}{50 \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{0.700}{0.500} = 1.4$$\n\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless reduction factor $r \\equiv g_{m}/g_{m,0}$. Using the derived expressions for $g_m$ and $g_{m,0}$:\n$$r = \\frac{g_m}{g_{m,0}} = \\frac{W C_{\\text{ox}} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{0} E}{1 + E/E_{\\text{sat}}} \\right)}{W C_{\\text{ox}} \\mu_{0} E}$$\nCanceling the common terms $W C_{\\text{ox}} \\mu_{0} E$ from the numerator and denominator, we obtain a simple expression for $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{1 + E/E_{\\text{sat}}}$$\nRecognizing that $E/E_{\\text{sat}}$ is the parameter $\\eta$, we have:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{1 + \\eta}$$\nUsing the calculated value $\\eta = 1.4$:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{1 + 1.4} = \\frac{1}{2.4} = 0.41666...$$\nThe problem requires the results to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$\\eta = 1.400$\n$r \\approx 0.4167$\n\nThe final answer is the row vector $(\\eta, r)$.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the standard model of MOSFET subthreshold operation, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of parameters, and is expressed in objective, technical language. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between the drain current $I_D$ and the gate voltage $V_G$ in the subthreshold regime. The current is due to thermionic injection of carriers from the source into the channel over an energy barrier. The height of this barrier is modulated by the gate voltage.\n\nFirst, we use the provided foundational basis that the carrier population contributing to the current is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, $\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{q \\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$, where $\\psi_s$ is the surface potential at the source-side of the channel, $q$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The drain current $I_D$ is directly proportional to this population:\n$$I_D \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q \\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we establish the relationship between the surface potential $\\psi_s$ and the gate voltage $V_G$. The problem specifies a linear electrostatic coupling in subthreshold, governed by a constant body factor $n$. This relationship is expressed differentially as:\n$$d\\psi_s = \\frac{1}{n} dV_G$$\nIntegrating this equation between two states $(V_{G1}, \\psi_{s1})$ and $(V_{G2}, \\psi_{s2})$ yields a linear relationship:\n$$\\psi_{s2} - \\psi_{s1} = \\frac{1}{n}(V_{G2} - V_{G1})$$\n\nCombining these two principles, we can express $I_D$ as a function of $V_G$. Let us consider two operating points, $(V_{G1}, I_{D1})$ and $(V_{G2}, I_{D2})$. The ratio of the currents is:\n$$\\frac{I_{D2}}{I_{D1}} = \\frac{C \\exp\\left(\\frac{q \\psi_{s2}}{k_B T}\\right)}{C \\exp\\left(\\frac{q \\psi_{s1}}{k_B T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{q(\\psi_{s2} - \\psi_{s1})}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of proportionality. Substituting the linear coupling relationship:\n$$\\frac{I_{D2}}{I_{D1}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{q}{k_B T} \\frac{1}{n}(V_{G2} - V_{G1})\\right)$$\nThis equation shows that the current depends exponentially on the gate voltage in the subthreshold regime.\n\nWe can now connect this to the definition of the subthreshold swing, $S \\equiv \\frac{d V_G}{d \\log_{10} I_D}$. By taking the base-$10$ logarithm of the current ratio expression, we find:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{D2}}{I_{D1}}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{q(V_{G2} - V_{G1})}{n k_B T}\\right)\\right)$$\nUsing the identity $\\log_{10}(e^x) = \\frac{x}{\\ln(10)}$:\n$$\\log_{10}(I_{D2}) - \\log_{10}(I_{D1}) = \\frac{q(V_{G2} - V_{G1})}{n k_B T \\ln(10)}$$\nThis shows that $\\log_{10}(I_D)$ is a linear function of $V_G$. The subthreshold swing $S$ is the slope of the $V_G$ versus $\\log_{10}(I_D)$ plot:\n$$S = \\frac{V_{G2} - V_{G1}}{\\log_{10}(I_{D2}) - \\log_{10}(I_{D1})} = n \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln(10)$$\nThis confirms the physical origin of $S$.\n\nTo compute the off-state current $I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}$, we rearrange the relationship:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{D2}}{I_{D1}}\\right) = \\frac{V_{G2} - V_{G1}}{S}$$\nWe are given a calibration point where $V_{G1} = V_T = 0.35\\,\\text{V}$ and $I_{D1} = I_T = 1.00\\,\\mu\\text{A} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{A}$. We need to find the current $I_{D2} = I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}$ at the off-state gate voltage $V_{G2} = 0.00\\,\\text{V}$. The subthreshold swing is given as $S = 80\\,\\text{mV/dec} = 0.080\\,\\text{V/dec}$.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{A}}\\right) = \\frac{0.00\\,\\text{V} - 0.35\\,\\text{V}}{0.080\\,\\text{V/dec}} = -\\frac{0.35}{0.080} = -4.375$$\nSolving for the ratio of currents by taking the antilogarithm (base $10$):\n$$\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{A}} = 10^{-4.375}$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{OFF}} = (1.00 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 10^{-4.375}\\,\\text{A} = 10^{-6} \\times 10^{-4.375}\\,\\text{A} = 10^{-10.375}\\,\\text{A}$$\nTo obtain the numerical value:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{OFF}} \\approx 4.216965 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{A}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in nanoamperes ($1\\,\\text{nA} = 10^{-9}\\,\\text{A}$):\n$$I_{\\text{OFF}} \\approx \\frac{4.216965 \\times 10^{-11}}{10^{-9}}\\,\\text{nA} \\approx 0.04216965\\,\\text{nA}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we obtain $I_{\\text{OFF}} \\approx 0.0422\\,\\text{nA}$.\n\nFor the qualitative analysis of the temperature dependence of $S$, we use the derived expression:\n$$S = n \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) \\ln(10)$$\nUnder the problem's assumption that $n$ is a constant, and given that $k_B$, $q$, and $\\ln(10)$ are fundamental constants, the subthreshold swing $S$ is directly proportional to the absolute temperature $T$. An increase in temperature leads to an increase in $S$, which signifies a degradation in the transistor's ability to switch from the off-state to the on-state. The value $k_B T/q$ represents the thermal voltage.",
