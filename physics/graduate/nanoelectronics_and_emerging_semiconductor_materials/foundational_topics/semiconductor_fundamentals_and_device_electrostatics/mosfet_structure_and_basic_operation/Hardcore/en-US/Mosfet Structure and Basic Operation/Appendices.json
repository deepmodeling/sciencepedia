            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the standard model of MOSFET subthreshold operation, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of parameters, and is expressed in objective, technical language. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between the drain current $I_D$ and the gate voltage $V_G$ in the subthreshold regime. The current is due to thermionic injection of carriers from the source into the channel over an energy barrier. The height of this barrier is modulated by the gate voltage.\n\nFirst, we use the provided foundational basis that the carrier population contributing to the current is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, $\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{q \\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$, where $\\psi_s$ is the surface potential at the source-side of the channel, $q$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The drain current $I_D$ is directly proportional to this population:\n$$I_D \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q \\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we establish the relationship between the surface potential $\\psi_s$ and the gate voltage $V_G$. The problem specifies a linear electrostatic coupling in subthreshold, governed by a constant body factor $n$. This relationship is expressed differentially as:\n$$d\\psi_s = \\frac{1}{n} dV_G$$\nIntegrating this equation between two states $(V_{G1}, \\psi_{s1})$ and $(V_{G2}, \\psi_{s2})$ yields a linear relationship:\n$$\\psi_{s2} - \\psi_{s1} = \\frac{1}{n}(V_{G2} - V_{G1})$$\n\nCombining these two principles, we can express $I_D$ as a function of $V_G$. Let us consider two operating points, $(V_{G1}, I_{D1})$ and $(V_{G2}, I_{D2})$. The ratio of the currents is:\n$$\\frac{I_{D2}}{I_{D1}} = \\frac{C \\exp\\left(\\frac{q \\psi_{s2}}{k_B T}\\right)}{C \\exp\\left(\\frac{q \\psi_{s1}}{k_B T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{q(\\psi_{s2} - \\psi_{s1})}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of proportionality. Substituting the linear coupling relationship:\n$$\\frac{I_{D2}}{I_{D1}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{q}{k_B T} \\frac{1}{n}(V_{G2} - V_{G1})\\right)$$\nThis equation shows that the current depends exponentially on the gate voltage in the subthreshold regime.\n\nWe can now connect this to the definition of the subthreshold swing, $S \\equiv \\frac{d V_G}{d \\log_{10} I_D}$. By taking the base-$10$ logarithm of the current ratio expression, we find:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{D2}}{I_{D1}}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{q(V_{G2} - V_{G1})}{n k_B T}\\right)\\right)$$\nUsing the identity $\\log_{10}(e^x) = \\frac{x}{\\ln(10)}$:\n$$\\log_{10}(I_{D2}) - \\log_{10}(I_{D1}) = \\frac{q(V_{G2} - V_{G1})}{n k_B T \\ln(10)}$$\nThis shows that $\\log_{10}(I_D)$ is a linear function of $V_G$. The subthreshold swing $S$ is the slope of the $V_G$ versus $\\log_{10}(I_D)$ plot:\n$$S = \\frac{V_{G2} - V_{G1}}{\\log_{10}(I_{D2}) - \\log_{10}(I_{D1})} = n \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln(10)$$\nThis confirms the physical origin of $S$.\n\nTo compute the off-state current $I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}$, we rearrange the relationship:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{D2}}{I_{D1}}\\right) = \\frac{V_{G2} - V_{G1}}{S}$$\nWe are given a calibration point where $V_{G1} = V_T = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $I_{D1} = I_T = 1.00\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A}$. We need to find the current $I_{D2} = I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}$ at the off-state gate voltage $V_{G2} = 0.00\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The subthreshold swing is given as $S = 80\\,\\mathrm{mV/dec} = 0.080\\,\\mathrm{V/dec}$.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A}}\\right) = \\frac{0.00\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.35\\,\\mathrm{V}}{0.080\\,\\mathrm{V/dec}} = -\\frac{0.35}{0.080} = -4.375$$\nSolving for the ratio of currents by taking the antilogarithm (base $10$):\n$$\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A}} = 10^{-4.375}$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{OFF}} = (1.00 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 10^{-4.375}\\,\\mathrm{A} = 10^{-6} \\times 10^{-4.375}\\,\\mathrm{A} = 10^{-10.375}\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nTo obtain the numerical value:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{OFF}} \\approx 4.216965 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in nanoamperes ($1\\,\\mathrm{nA} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{A}$):\n$$I_{\\mathrm{OFF}} \\approx \\frac{4.216965 \\times 10^{-11}}{10^{-9}}\\,\\mathrm{nA} \\approx 0.04216965\\,\\mathrm{nA}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we obtain $I_{\\mathrm{OFF}} \\approx 0.0422\\,\\mathrm{nA}$.\n\nFor the qualitative analysis of the temperature dependence of $S$, we use the derived expression:\n$$S = n \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) \\ln(10)$$\nUnder the problem's assumption that $n$ is a constant, and given that $k_B$, $q$, and $\\ln(10)$ are fundamental constants, the subthreshold swing $S$ is directly proportional to the absolute temperature $T$. An increase in temperature leads to an increase in $S$, which signifies a degradation in the transistor's ability to switch from the off-state to the on-state.

The given values are within realistic ranges for modern semiconductor devices.\n\n- **Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n  - The problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Saturation Current Model**\n\nThe drain current $I_D$ in an $n$-channel MOSFET is due to the drift of electrons in the inversion layer. The drift current at any point $x$ along the channel (from source at $x=0$ to drain at $x=L$) is given by the product of the channel width $W$, the mobile inversion charge density per unit area $|Q_{inv}(x)|$, and the electron drift velocity $v_d(x)$. For a long-channel device with a constant low-field mobility $\\mu$, the drift velocity is $v_d(x) = \\mu E(x) = \\mu \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$, where $V(x)$ is the channel potential.\n\n$$I_D = W |Q_{inv}(x)| \\mu \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$$\n\nUnder the gradual-channel approximation, the inversion charge density is controlled by the local gate-to-channel potential difference, $|Q_{inv}(x)| = C_{ox}(V_G - V_T - V(x))$. Substituting this into the current equation gives:\n\n$$I_D = W \\mu C_{ox} (V_G - V_T - V(x)) \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$$\n\nSince the current $I_D$ must be constant along the channel in steady state, we can integrate this expression from the source ($x=0$, $V(0)=0$) to the drain ($x=L$, $V(L)=V_D$):\n\n$$I_D \\int_{0}^{L} dx = W \\mu C_{ox} \\int_{0}^{V_D} (V_G - V_T - V) dV$$\n\nPerforming the integration yields the general I-V characteristic for the linear (triode) region:\n\n$$I_D L = W \\mu C_{ox} \\left[ (V_G - V_T)V - \\frac{1}{2}V^2 \\right]_{0}^{V_D}$$\n$$I_D = \\frac{\\mu C_{ox} W}{L} \\left[ (V_G - V_T)V_D - \\frac{1}{2}V_D^2 \\right]$$\n\nSaturation begins when the channel is \"pinched off\" at the drain end, which occurs when the local inversion charge tends to zero. This happens at a drain voltage $V_D = V_{D,sat}$ such that $V_G - V_T - V_{D,sat} = 0$. Thus, the saturation drain voltage is $V_{D,sat} = V_G - V_T$. The ideal saturation current, $I_{D,sat}$, is found by substituting $V_D = V_{D,sat}$ into the linear-region equation:\n\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{\\mu C_{ox} W}{L} \\left[ (V_G - V_T)(V_G - V_T) - \\frac{1}{2}(V_G - V_T)^2 \\right]$$\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_G - V_T)^2$$\n\nThis expression can be written in terms of the source-end inversion charge density, $|Q_{inv}(x=0)| = C_{ox}(V_G - V_T)$, as $I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{W}{L} \\mu |Q_{inv}(0)| (V_G - V_T)$.\n\nFor $V_D > V_{D,sat}$, the pinch-off point moves from $x=L$ towards the source to a new position $L_{eff} < L$. The current is now determined by this effective channel length $L_{eff}$. The standard first-order model for channel-length modulation (CLM) approximates the drain current in saturation as:\n\n$$I_D(V_D) = I_{D,sat} (1 + \\lambda V_D) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_G - V_T)^2 (1 + \\lambda V_D)$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the empirical channel-length modulation parameter.\n\n**Part 1: Ideal Saturation Current Calculation**\n\nWe calculate the ideal saturation current $I_{D,ideal}$ assuming no channel-length modulation ($\\lambda=0$) and using the nominal mobility $\\mu_0$. The required parameters are:\n- $\\mu_0 = 50\\ \\mathrm{cm^2/(V \\cdot s)} = 50 \\times (10^{-2})^2\\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V \\cdot s)} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V \\cdot s)}$\n- $C_{ox} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{F/m^2}$\n- $W = 0.80\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.80 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $L = 0.24\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.24 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $V_G - V_T = 1.10\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.35\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.75\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n\nThe aspect ratio is $\\frac{W}{L} = \\frac{0.80 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{0.24 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{10}{3}$.\nIn the ideal saturation model, the current is independent of $V_D$ for $V_D \\ge V_{D,sat}$.

The required tasks—explanation, derivation, and calculation—are clearly defined.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n- **Consistency Check:** The saturation condition is explicitly checked and confirmed: $V_{D,sat} = V_{\\text{GS}} - V_{\\text{TH}} = 0.90\\,\\text{V} - 0.40\\,\\text{V} = 0.50\\,\\text{V}$. The operating condition $V_D = 1.20\\,\\text{V}$ satisfies $V_D > V_{D,sat}$, confirming the device operates in the saturation region. The provided parameters, while representing an idealized scenario (e.g., neglecting velocity saturation in a $50\\,\\text{nm}$ device), are self-consistent within the specified theoretical framework.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound exercise in semiconductor device physics. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires an explanation of the physical origin of finite output resistance ($r_o$) due to channel length modulation, a derivation of the expression for $r_o$, and a numerical calculation.\n\n**Physical Origin of Finite Output Resistance**\nIn an ideal long-channel MOSFET model, when the drain-to-source voltage $V_D$ reaches the saturation voltage $V_{D,sat} = V_{GS} - V_{TH}$, the inversion channel is \"pinched off\" at the drain end ($y=L$). This means the mobile electron charge density at that point becomes approximately zero. For $V_D > V_{D,sat}$, the ideal model predicts that the drain current $I_D$ saturates and becomes independent of $V_D$. This would imply an infinite output resistance ($r_o = (\\partial I_D / \\partial V_D)^{-1} \\to \\infty$).\n\nIn reality, for $V_D > V_{D,sat}$, the point where the channel potential is $V_{GS} - V_{TH}$ and the inversion charge becomes zero moves from the drain end ($y=L$) towards the source, to a new position $y=L_{eff}$. The channel effectively shortens. The region between this new pinch-off point and the drain, of length $\\Delta L = L - L_{eff}$, becomes a space-charge region (depletion region). The voltage across the conductive channel (from $y=0$ to $y=L_{eff}$) remains fixed at $V_{D,sat}$, while the excess voltage, $V_D - V_{D,sat}$, is dropped across this depletion region.\n\nAs $V_D$ increases, the electric field in this depletion region intensifies, causing it to widen. Consequently, $\\Delta L$ increases, and the effective channel length $L_{eff}$ decreases. The saturation drain current, according to the gradual channel approximation, is inversely proportional to the channel length. Therefore, the current is more accurately described as being proportional to $1/L_{eff}$ rather than $1/L$.\n$$I_D \\propto \\frac{1}{L_{eff}} = \\frac{1}{L - \\Delta L}$$\nSince an increase in $V_D$ causes a decrease in $L_{eff}$, the drain current $I_D$ does not perfectly saturate but continues to increase slightly with $V_D$. This non-zero slope of the $I_D-V_D$ characteristic in the saturation region, $\\partial I_D / \\partial V_D > 0$, gives rise to a finite output conductance $g_d = \\partial I_D / \\partial V_D$. The output resistance, $r_o = 1/g_d$, is therefore finite. This effect is known as channel length modulation (CLM).\n\n**Derivation of the Expression for Output Resistance**\nThe ideal saturation drain current, neglecting CLM, is given by:\n$$I_{D,ideal\\_sat} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{\\text{TH}})^2$$\nHere, $C_{ox} = \\varepsilon_{ox} / t_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area. To account for channel length modulation, a simple empirical model is used, which modifies the ideal current expression with a linear dependence on $V_D$:\n$$I_D(V_D) = I_{D,ideal\\_sat} (1 + \\lambda V_D)$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the channel length modulation parameter.\n\nThe output conductance, $g_d$, is defined as the partial derivative of the drain current with respect to the drain-to-source voltage at a constant gate-to-source voltage:\n$$g_d = \\left. \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_D} \\right|_{V_{GS}=\\text{const.}}$$\nApplying this to the CLM model for current:\n$$g_d = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_D} \\left[ I_{D,ideal\\_sat} (1 + \\lambda V_D) \\right] = I_{D,ideal\\_sat} \\lambda$$\nThe output resistance $r_o$ is the reciprocal of the output conductance:\n$$r_o = \\frac{1}{g_d} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda I_{D,ideal\\_sat}}$$\nThis expression relates $r_o$ to $\\lambda$ and the ideal saturation current. The \"saturation drain current\" can also refer to the actual current at the operating point, $I_{D,op} = I_{D,ideal\\_sat}(1+\\lambda V_{D,op})$. In that case, $I_{D,ideal\\_sat} = I_{D,op} / (1+\\lambda V_{D,op})$. Substituting this gives a more general form:\n$$r_o = \\frac{1+\\lambda V_{D,op}}{\\lambda I_{D,op}}$$\nFor calculations where all model parameters are known, it is most direct to compute $I_{D,ideal\\_sat}$ and then use $r_o = 1/(\\lambda I_{D,ideal\\_sat})$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nFirst, we calculate the constants needed.\nThe gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $C_{ox}$, is:\n$$C_{ox} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} = \\frac{3.9\\,\\varepsilon_0}{t_{ox}} = \\frac{3.9 \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F/m})}{2.2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}} \\approx 1.5696 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{F/m}^2$$\n\nNext, we calculate the ideal saturation current, $I_{D,ideal\\_sat}$.\nThe aspect ratio is $W/L = (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}) / (50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}) = 20$.\nThe overdrive voltage is $V_{GS} - V_{\\text{TH}} = 0.90\\,\\text{V} - 0.40\\,\\text{V} = 0.50\\,\\text{V}$.\n$$I_{D,ideal\\_sat} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{\\text{TH}})^2$$\n$$I_{D,ideal\\_sat} = \\frac{1}{2} (0.05\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{V s}) (1.5696 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{F/m}^2) (20) (0.50\\,\\text{V})^2$$\n$$I_{D,ideal\\_sat} = (0.5) (0.05) (1.5696 \\times 10^{-2}) (20) (0.25)\\,\\text{A}$$\n$$I_{D,ideal\\_sat} \\approx 1.962 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{A}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the output resistance $r_o$ using the derived formula and the given value of $\\lambda = 0.050\\,\\text{V}^{-1}$:\n$$r_o = \\frac{1}{\\lambda I_{D,ideal\\_sat}}$$\n$$r_o = \\frac{1}{(0.050\\,\\text{V}^{-1}) (1.962 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{A})} \\approx \\frac{1}{9.81 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\Omega^{-1}}$$\n$$r_o \\approx 10194\\,\\Omega$$\n\nThe problem requires the result in units of $\\text{k}\\Omega$ and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$r_o \\approx 10.194\\,\\text{k}\\Omega$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $r_o = 10.2\\,\\text{k}\\Omega$. The numerical value to be reported is $10.2$.",
