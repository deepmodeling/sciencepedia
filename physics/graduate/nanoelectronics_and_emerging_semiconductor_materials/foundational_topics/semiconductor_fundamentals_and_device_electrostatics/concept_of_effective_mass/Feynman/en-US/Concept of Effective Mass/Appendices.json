This practice will guide you through a direct application of this definition using a simplified one-dimensional crystal model described by the tight-binding approximation.

            "problem": "Consider a simplified one-dimensional model for an electron moving along a long polymer chain, which can be modeled as a 1D crystal lattice. The energy $E$ of the electron as a function of its wavevector $k$ is described by the dispersion relation $E(k) = A(1 - \\cos(ka))$, where $A$ is a positive constant with units of energy and $a$ is the lattice constant representing the distance between repeating monomer units. In this model, the electron's response to an external force is characterized by its effective mass, $m^*$. Determine the expression for the effective mass of the electron at the bottom of the energy band, which occurs at the band minimum $k=0$.

This exercise explores a \"Mexican hat\" dispersion, a model relevant to certain 2D semiconductors, where the effective mass is not constant but depends on the carrier's momentum. You will determine the critical momentum at which a hole transitions from behaving like a normal particle (positive mass) to an exotic one (negative mass), a key feature of such non-parabolic systems .",

This approach is essential for describing the degenerate and anisotropic valence bands found in materials like Gallium Arsenide (GaAs).

Consider the $J=3/2$ basis with $J_{z}$ eigenvalues $\\pm 3/2$ and $\\pm 1/2$, and the effective Luttinger Hamiltonian written in terms of the three Luttinger parameters $\\gamma_{1}$, $\\gamma_{2}$, and $\\gamma_{3}$ and the angular momentum operators $J_{x}$, $J_{y}$, and $J_{z}$.

No physical units are required because the answer is a ratio to $m_{0}$.",
            "solution": "The valence band structure of a cubic zincblende semiconductor near the Brillouin zone center (the $\\Gamma$ point) is described by the $4 \\times 4$ Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian, which acts on the basis of total angular momentum states $|J, J_z\\rangle$. For the top of the valence band, we consider the $J=3/2$ manifold. The basis states are typically ordered as $|3/2, 3/2\\rangle$, $|3/2, 1/2\\rangle$, $|3/2, -1/2\\rangle$, and $|3/2, -3/2\\rangle$. The Hamiltonian, written in terms of the Luttinger parameters $\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$, and $\\gamma_3$, can be expressed as a matrix:\n\n$$\nH = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_0} \\begin{pmatrix}\nP+Q & -S & R & 0 \\\\\n-S^* & P-Q & 0 & R \\\\\nR^* & 0 & P-Q & S \\\\\n0 & R^* & S^* & P+Q\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $m_0$ is the free electron rest mass, and the matrix elements $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are functions of the wavevector components $(k_x, k_y, k_z)$:\n$P = \\gamma_1 (k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2)$\n$Q = \\gamma_2 (k_x^2 + k_y^2 - 2k_z^2)$\n$R = \\sqrt{3}\\gamma_2(k_x^2 - k_y^2) - i 2\\sqrt{3}\\gamma_3 k_x k_y$\n$S = 2\\sqrt{3}\\gamma_3 k_z (k_x - i k_y)$\n\nThe problem specifies that the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ is along the $[001]$ direction. This corresponds to setting $k_x = 0$, $k_y = 0$, and $k_z = k$. We substitute these into the expressions for the matrix elements:\n\n$P = \\gamma_1 (0^2 + 0^2 + k^2) = \\gamma_1 k^2$\n$Q = \\gamma_2 (0^2 + 0^2 - 2k^2) = -2\\gamma_2 k^2$\n$R = \\sqrt{3}\\gamma_2(0^2 - 0^2) - i 2\\sqrt{3}\\gamma_3 (0)(0) = 0$\n$S = 2\\sqrt{3}\\gamma_3 k (0 - i \\cdot 0) = 0$\n\nWith $R=0$ and $S=0$, all off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian matrix become zero. The Hamiltonian simplifies to a diagonal matrix:\n\n$$\nH = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_0} \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma_1 k^2 - 2\\gamma_2 k^2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\gamma_1 k^2 + 2\\gamma_2 k^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\gamma_1 k^2 + 2\\gamma_2 k^2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & \\gamma_1 k^2 - 2\\gamma_2 k^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= -\\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0} \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & \\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this diagonal matrix are the energy dispersion relations $E(k)$ for the electron states in the valence bands. We obtain two distinct, doubly-degenerate energy bands:\n$E_A(k) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}(\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2)$ which corresponds to the $|J_z|=\\pm 3/2$ states.\n$E_B(k) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}(\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2)$ which corresponds to the $|J_z|=\\pm 1/2$ states.\n\nThe energy of hole states is defined as $E_h(k) = -E_e(k)$, where $E_e(k)$ are the electron energies we just found. Thus, the hole dispersion relations, measured from the band edge at $k=0$, are:\n$E_{h,A}(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}(\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2)$\n$E_{h,B}(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}(\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2)$\n\nThe effective mass $m^*$ is defined from the curvature of the energy band near a band extremum ($\\Gamma$ point, $k=0$) through the parabolic band approximation, $E(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^*}$. The inverse effective mass is related to the second derivative of the energy dispersion:\n$$ \\frac{1}{m^*} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{d^2 E}{dk^2} $$\nThe quantity $\\frac{d^2 E}{dk^2}$ is the quadratic energy curvature. For our two hole bands, the curvatures are:\nCurvature for band A: $\\frac{d^2 E_{h,A}}{dk^2} = \\frac{d^2}{dk^2} \\left[ \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}(\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2) \\right] = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_0}(\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2)$\nCurvature for band B: $\\frac{d^2 E_{h,B}}{dk^2} = \\frac{d^2}{dk^2} \\left[ \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}(\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2) \\right] = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_0}(\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2)$\n\nThe Luttinger parameters $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ are positive. Therefore, $(\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2) > (\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2)$. A larger curvature corresponds to a smaller effective mass.\nBand B has a larger curvature, so it is the light-hole (lh) band. Band A has a smaller curvature, so it is the heavy-hole (hh) band.\n\nUsing the definition of effective mass, we find the analytic expressions:\nFor the heavy-hole band: $\\frac{1}{m_{\\mathrm{hh}}^*} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_0}(\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2) \\right) = \\frac{\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2}{m_0}$.\n$$ m_{\\mathrm{hh}}^* = \\frac{m_0}{\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2} $$\nFor the light-hole band: $\\frac{1}{m_{\\mathrm{lh}}^*} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_0}(\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2) \\right) = \\frac{\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2}{m_0}$.\n$$ m_{\\mathrm{lh}}^* = \\frac{m_0}{\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2} $$\n\nThe parameter $\\gamma_3$ does not appear in these expressions because it is associated with the anisotropy, or \"warping\", of the valence bands. In the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian, $\\gamma_3$ appears only in the off-diagonal terms $R$ and $S$. These terms contain products of different wavevector components (e.g., $k_x k_y$ in $R$, and $k_x k_z, k_y k_z$ in $S$). When the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ is aligned along a high-symmetry cubic axis such as $[001]$, where $k_x=k_y=0$, these products become zero. Consequently, the terms containing $\\gamma_3$ vanish, the Hamiltonian becomes diagonal, and $\\gamma_3$ does not influence the energy dispersion or the effective masses along this specific direction.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical ratios for Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) using the given parameters: $\\gamma_1 = 6.98$, $\\gamma_2 = 2.06$, and $\\gamma_3 = 2.93$.\n\nThe ratio for the heavy-hole effective mass is:\n$$ \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{hh}}^*}{m_0} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2} = \\frac{1}{6.98 - 2(2.06)} = \\frac{1}{6.98 - 4.12} = \\frac{1}{2.86} \\approx 0.3496503... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.3497$.\n\nThe ratio for the light-hole effective mass is:\n$$ \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{lh}}^*}{m_0} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2} = \\frac{1}{6.98 + 2(2.06)} = \\frac{1}{6.98 + 4.12} = \\frac{1}{11.10} \\approx 0.09009009... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.09009$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing these two values in the order of heavy-hole then light-hole.",
