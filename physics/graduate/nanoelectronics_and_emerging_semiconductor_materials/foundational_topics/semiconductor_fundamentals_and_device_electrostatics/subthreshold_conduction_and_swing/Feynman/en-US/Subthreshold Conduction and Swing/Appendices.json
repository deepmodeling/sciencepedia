            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained, providing all necessary definitions, constants, and constraints to derive the requested expressions and compute the numerical values. The premises are based on established principles of semiconductor device physics. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in three stages: first, the derivation of the temperature-dependent subthreshold swing $S$; second, the numerical calculation of $S$ at specified temperatures; and third, a brief commentary on the experimental significance of the results.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Subthreshold Swing Formula**\n\n**Part (a): Current-Potential Relationship**\n\nIn the subthreshold (weak inversion) regime of an n-channel MOSFET, the conduction band edge at the semiconductor-oxide interface is still significantly above the Fermi level, i.e., $(E_{c} - E_{F}) \\gg k_{B}T$. Under this condition, the Fermi-Dirac distribution for electron occupation probability, $f(E) = (1 + \\exp((E-E_F)/(k_B T)))^{-1}$, can be accurately approximated by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, $f(E) \\approx \\exp(-(E-E_F)/(k_B T))$.\n\nFor a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor, the density of states per unit area, $g_{2D}(E)$, is constant for energies above the conduction band minimum, $E_c$. The sheet carrier density of electrons, $n_s$, in the inversion layer is found by integrating the product of the density of states and the occupation probability over all available states in the conduction band:\n$$n_s = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} g_{2D}(E) f(E) \\,dE \\approx g_{2D} \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E-E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\,dE$$\nThe integral evaluates to $k_B T \\exp(-(E_c-E_F)/(k_B T))$. The position of the conduction band edge $E_c$ at the surface is controlled by the surface potential $\\psi_s$. An increase in $\\psi_s$ lowers the electrostatic potential energy for an electron by $-q\\psi_s$, so $E_c = E_{c,0} - q\\psi_s$, where $E_{c,0}$ is a reference energy level. Substituting this into the expression for $n_s$:\n$$n_s \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(E_{c,0} - q\\psi_s) - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{c,0} - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nSince $E_{c,0}$ and $E_F$ are fixed for a given bulk doping and bias, we find that the sheet carrier density is exponentially dependent on the surface potential:\n$$n_s \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nIn the subthreshold regime, carrier transport is dominated by diffusion. The diffusion current is proportional to the gradient of the carrier concentration. For a long-channel device with a small drain-source voltage $V_{DS}$, the drain current $I_D$ is proportional to the total number of mobile carriers in the channel, and thus proportional to $n_s$. Therefore, we establish the required relationship:\n$$I_D \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\n**Part (b): Body Factor $m$**\n\nThe gate voltage $V_G$ is capacitively coupled to the channel. A change in gate voltage, $dV_G$, is divided between the gate oxide and the semiconductor:\n$$dV_G = dV_{ox} + d\\psi_s$$\nwhere $dV_{ox}$ is the change in voltage across the oxide and $d\\psi_s$ is the change in surface potential.\nLet $C_{ox}$ be the gate oxide capacitance per unit area and $C_s$ be the semiconductor capacitance per unit area. The change in charge on the gate per unit area, $dQ_G$, is related to $dV_{ox}$ by $dQ_G = C_{ox} dV_{ox}$.\nBy charge conservation, this change in charge must be balanced by an opposite change in the semiconductor charge, $dQ_s$, such that $dQ_G = -dQ_s$. The semiconductor capacitance is defined as $C_s \\equiv -{dQ_s}/{d\\psi_s}$. Therefore, $dQ_G = C_s d\\psi_s$.\nEquating the two expressions for $dQ_G$ gives $C_{ox} dV_{ox} = C_s d\\psi_s$, which implies $dV_{ox} = \\frac{C_s}{C_{ox}}d\\psi_s$.\nSubstituting this back into the voltage division equation:\n$$dV_G = \\left(\\frac{C_s}{C_{ox}}\\right) d\\psi_s + d\\psi_s = \\left(1 + \\frac{C_s}{C_{ox}}\\right) d\\psi_s$$\nThe body factor $m$ is defined as the ratio of the change in gate voltage to the resulting change in surface potential, $m \\equiv \\frac{dV_G}{d\\psi_s}$. From our derived relation, we have:\n$$m = 1 + \\frac{C_s}{C_{ox}}$$\nThe semiconductor capacitance $C_s$ represents the series combination of all capacitances from the semiconductor side, such as depletion capacitance ($C_{dep}$), interface trap capacitance ($C_{it}$), and quantum capacitance ($C_Q$). As all physical capacitances are passive and non-negative ($C_{ox} > 0$ and $C_s \\ge 0$), the ratio $\\frac{C_s}{C_{ox}} \\ge 0$. Consequently, the body factor $m$ must satisfy:\n$$m \\ge 1$$\nThe ideal limit, $m=1$, corresponds to perfect gate control over the channel, which would require $C_s=0$ or an infinitely large oxide capacitance $C_{ox} \\to \\infty$.\n\n**Part (c): Subthreshold Swing $S$**\n\nThe subthreshold swing $S$ is defined as the change in gate voltage required to change the drain current by one order of magnitude (a decade). Mathematically, it is the inverse of the slope of the plot of $\\log_{10} I_D$ versus $V_G$:\n$$S \\equiv \\left(\\frac{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}{dV_G}\\right)^{-1}$$\nWe evaluate the derivative using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}{dV_G} = \\frac{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}{d\\psi_s} \\cdot \\frac{d\\psi_s}{dV_G}$$\nFrom the definition of the body factor $m$, we have $\\frac{d\\psi_s}{dV_G} = \\frac{1}{m}$.\nNext, we evaluate the first term. Using the change of base formula for logarithms, $\\log_{10}(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(10)}$, we have:\n$$\\frac{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}{d\\psi_s} = \\frac{d}{d\\psi_s}\\left(\\frac{\\ln I_D}{\\ln 10}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\ln 10} \\frac{d(\\ln I_D)}{d\\psi_s}$$\nFrom Part (a), $I_D = A \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$ where $A$ is a proportionality constant. Taking the natural logarithm gives $\\ln I_D = \\ln A + \\frac{q\\psi_s}{k_B T}$. Differentiating with respect to $\\psi_s$:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln I_D)}{d\\psi_s} = \\frac{q}{k_B T}$$\nCombining these results:\n$$\\frac{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}{dV_G} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\ln 10} \\frac{q}{k_B T}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right) = \\frac{q}{m k_B T \\ln 10}$$\nSubstituting this back into the definition of $S$:\n$$S = \\left(\\frac{q}{m k_B T \\ln 10}\\right)^{-1} = m \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) \\ln 10$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the subthreshold swing, showing its linear dependence on both the body factor $m$ and the absolute temperature $T$. The quantity $\\frac{k_B T}{q}$ is the thermal voltage, $V_{th}$.\n\n**2. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe compute the value of $S$ at the specified temperatures using the derived formula, the given constants, and the fixed body factor $m = 1.20$. The constants are $k_B = 1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$ and $q = 1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$. The result is required in units of millivolts per decade ($\\mathrm{mV/decade}$), so we must multiply the result in Volts by $1000$.\n\nThe formula is $S = m \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) \\ln(10)$.\n$S\\,[\\mathrm{mV/decade}] = 1000 \\times m \\times T \\times \\frac{k_B \\ln(10)}{q}$.\n\nLet's compute the constant part:\n$$\\frac{k_B \\ln(10)}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times \\ln(10)}{1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 1.98406 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{V/K}$$\n\nAt $T = 77\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$S_{77} = 1000 \\times 1.20 \\times 77 \\times (1.98406 \\times 10^{-4}) \\approx 18.3327\\,\\mathrm{mV/decade}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $S_{77} = 18.33\\,\\mathrm{mV/decade}$.\n\nAt $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$S_{300} = 1000 \\times 1.20 \\times 300 \\times (1.98406 \\times 10^{-4}) \\approx 71.4262\\,\\mathrm{mV/decade}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $S_{300} = 71.43\\,\\mathrm{mV/decade}$. Note that the theoretical minimum swing at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ (for $m=1$) is approximately $60\\,\\mathrm{mV/decade}$. Our result of $1.2 \\times 60 \\approx 72$ is consistent.\n\nAt $T = 400\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$S_{400} = 1000 \\times 1.20 \\times 400 \\times (1.98406 \\times 10^{-4}) \\approx 95.2350\\,\\mathrm{mV/decade}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $S_{400} = 95.24\\,\\mathrm{mV/decade}$.\n\n**3. Commentary on Experimental Resolvability**\n\nThe computed differences in subthreshold swing are $S_{300} - S_{77} \\approx 53.1\\,\\mathrm{mV/decade}$ and $S_{400} - S_{300} \\approx 23.8\\,\\mathrm{mV/decade}$. These differences are substantial. Modern semiconductor parameter analyzers can measure gate voltages and drain currents with very high precision, far exceeding what would be required to resolve differences of tens of millivolts per decade.\n\nThe experimental extraction of $S$ involves measuring the $I_D-V_G$ characteristic and finding the maximum slope on a semi-log plot. While the measurement itself is straightforward, several physical effects can complicate the interpretation. In a real device, the body factor $m = 1 + C_s/C_{ox}$ is not a constant; the semiconductor capacitance $C_s$ can be a function of temperature due to the temperature dependence of the interface-trap capacitance ($C_{it}$) and the quantum capacitance ($C_Q$). For 2D materials, $C_Q$ can be a significant and temperature-sensitive component.\n\nHowever, the primary effect described by the relation $S \\propto T$ is dominant and robust. An experiment measuring $S$ as a function of $T$ is a standard device characterization technique. The expected result is a nearly linear increase of $S$ with $T$, and the magnitude of this change is very large. Deviations from perfect linearity would provide information about the temperature dependence of $m$. Therefore, the calculated differences between the values of $S$ at $77\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $400\\,\\mathrm{K}$ are not only experimentally resolvable but are a fundamental and readily observable characteristic of MOSFET operation.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The provided parameters are physically realistic for a short-channel two-dimensional material field-effect transistor. The task is to derive and compute the subthreshold swing under the influence of Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL), which is a standard problem in semiconductor device physics. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe subthreshold drain current $I_D$ in a MOSFET is dominated by thermionic emission of carriers over an energy barrier, which is controlled by the surface potential $\\psi_s$. The current has an exponential dependence on $\\psi_s$:\n$$I_D \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe subthreshold swing $S$ is defined as the change in gate voltage $V_G$ required to produce a one-decade change in the drain current $I_D$. Mathematically, it is the inverse of the slope of the $\\log_{10}(I_D)$ versus $V_G$ curve:\n$$S = \\left(\\frac{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}{dV_G}\\right)^{-1}$$\nTo relate $S$ to the physical parameters, we first express the derivative using the natural logarithm:\n$$\\frac{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}{dV_G} = \\frac{d}{dV_G}\\left(\\frac{\\ln I_D}{\\ln 10}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\ln 10} \\frac{d(\\ln I_D)}{dV_G}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_D$:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln I_D)}{dV_G} = \\frac{d}{dV_G}\\left(\\frac{q\\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{q}{k_B T} \\frac{d\\psi_s}{dV_G}$$\nCombining these results, the subthreshold swing is:\n$$S = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\ln 10} \\frac{q}{k_B T} \\frac{d\\psi_s}{dV_G}\\right)^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln 10\\right) \\left(\\frac{d\\psi_s}{dV_G}\\right)^{-1}$$\nThe term $\\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln 10$ represents the ideal, or thermionic, limit of the subthreshold swing, denoted as $S_{ideal}$. At $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, its value is approximately $59.5\\,\\mathrm{mV/dec}$.\n\nThe term $(d\\psi_s/dV_G)^{-1}$ is the subthreshold ideality factor, often denoted by $m$. It quantifies the effectiveness of the gate in controlling the surface potential. This is determined by a capacitive voltage divider model, where the gate capacitance $C_{ox}$ competes with all other capacitances coupled to the channel, which we can group as a single channel capacitance $C_{ch}$. This gives:\n$$\\frac{d\\psi_s}{dV_G} = \\frac{C_{ox}}{C_{ox} + C_{ch}}$$\nTherefore, the ideality factor is $m = 1 + \\frac{C_{ch}}{C_{ox}}$. The subthreshold swing is then written as:\n$$S = m S_{ideal} = \\left(1 + \\frac{C_{ch}}{C_{ox}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln 10\\right)$$\nAt zero drain bias ($V_D \\rightarrow 0$), we have the baseline subthreshold swing $S_0$, corresponding to an ideality factor $m_0$.\n$$S_0 = m_0 S_{ideal} = 62.0\\,\\mathrm{mV/dec}$$\nWhen a drain bias $V_D$ is applied, especially in a short-channel device, the drain exerts a stronger electrostatic influence on the channel. This effect, known as Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL), increases the effective channel capacitance $C_{ch}$ (by increasing the drain-to-channel coupling component). This leads to a larger ideality factor $m(V_D)$ and thus a degraded (larger) subthreshold swing $S(V_D)$.\n\nThe problem asks for a first-order expression for the effective subthreshold swing, assuming the drain-to-channel coupling grows linearly with $V_D$. This implies that for small $V_D$, the swing $S(V_D)$ can be approximated by a first-order Taylor expansion around $V_D=0$:\n$$S(V_D) \\approx S(0) + \\left.\\frac{dS}{dV_D}\\right|_{V_D=0} V_D$$\nLetting $S_0 = S(0)$ and factoring, we get:\n$$S(V_D) \\approx S_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{S_0} \\left.\\frac{dS}{dV_D}\\right|_{V_D=0} V_D\\right)$$\nThe problem provides the \"effective small-signal DIBL coupling coefficient\" $\\alpha = 0.18\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}$.

This condition generally holds if the dimensionless product $\\alpha V_D$ is much less than unity ($\\alpha V_D \\ll 1$). In this case, $\\alpha V_D = 0.108$, which is small, suggesting the linear approximation is reasonably accurate. Physically, this linear model relies on the assumption that changes in device electrostatics (e.g., depletion widths, coupling capacitances) are linear with $V_D$, which is itself an approximation valid for small bias ranges. The problem statement's constraints that high-field nonlinearities and impact ionization are negligible are critical for this model's applicability.",

            "solution": "The user-provided problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary data and definitions are provided for a unique solution. The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the body factor $m$ and subthreshold swing $S$ for several semiconductor devices, followed by ranking and analysis. We shall proceed by first deriving the necessary equations from the stated first principles.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\n**1. Body Factor, $m$**\n\nThe body factor, $m$, is defined as the ratio of the change in gate voltage, $\\mathrm{d}V_g$, to the corresponding change in surface potential, $\\mathrm{d}\\psi_s$, under subthreshold conditions:\n$$m \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_g}{\\mathrm{d}\\psi_s}$$\nTo derive an expression for $m$, we consider the small-signal equivalent circuit of the gate-to-channel structure. The gate voltage $V_g$ is applied across a series combination of the total gate stack capacitance, $C_{g,tot}$, and the semiconductor capacitance, $C_s$.\n\nA small change in gate voltage, $\\mathrm{d}V_g$, is divided between the voltage drop across the gate stack, $\\mathrm{d}V_{stack}$, and the change in surface potential, $\\mathrm{d}\\psi_s$:\n$$\\mathrm{d}V_g = \\mathrm{d}V_{stack} + \\mathrm{d}\\psi_s$$\nFrom the definition of capacitance, $C \\equiv \\mathrm{d}Q/\\mathrm{d}V$, the voltage drop across the gate stack is related to the change in charge on the gate, $\\mathrm{d}Q_g$, by:\n$$\\mathrm{d}V_{stack} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q_g}{C_{g,tot}}$$\nSimilarly, the change in surface potential is related to the change in charge in the semiconductor, $\\mathrm{d}Q_s$, by:\n$$\\mathrm{d}\\psi_s = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q_s}{C_s}$$\nBy charge neutrality, any change in gate charge must be mirrored by an opposite change in semiconductor charge. For small signals, we consider the magnitudes, so $\\mathrm{d}Q_g = \\mathrm{d}Q_s$. Let this be $\\mathrm{d}Q$.\n\nFrom the semiconductor capacitance relation, we can express $\\mathrm{d}Q$ as $\\mathrm{d}Q = C_s \\mathrm{d}\\psi_s$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mathrm{d}V_{stack}$:\n$$\\mathrm{d}V_{stack} = \\frac{C_s \\mathrm{d}\\psi_s}{C_{g,tot}}$$\nNow, substituting this back into the voltage division equation:\n$$\\mathrm{d}V_g = \\frac{C_s \\mathrm{d}\\psi_s}{C_{g,tot}} + \\mathrm{d}\\psi_s$$\nFactoring out $\\mathrm{d}\\psi_s$:\n$$\\mathrm{d}V_g = \\left(1 + \\frac{C_s}{C_{g,tot}}\\right) \\mathrm{d}\\psi_s$$\nFinally, we obtain the expression for the body factor by rearranging the equation to match its definition:\n$$m = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_g}{\\mathrm{d}\\psi_s} = 1 + \\frac{C_s}{C_{g,tot}}$$\n\n**2. Subthreshold Swing, $S$**\n\nThe subthreshold swing, $S$, is the change in gate voltage required to change the drain current $I_D$ by one decade. In the subthreshold regime, the drain current is dominated by diffusion and is exponentially dependent on the surface potential $\\psi_s$ through a Boltzmann factor:\n$$I_D \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nTo increase the current by a factor of $10$, from $I_{D1}$ to $I_{D2} = 10 \\cdot I_{D1}$, the surface potential must change from $\\psi_{s1}$ to $\\psi_{s2}$ such that:\n$$\\frac{I_{D2}}{I_{D1}} = 10 = \\frac{\\exp\\left(q\\psi_{s2}/(k_B T)\\right)}{\\exp\\left(q\\psi_{s1}/(k_B T)\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{q(\\psi_{s2} - \\psi_{s1})}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\\ln(10) = \\frac{q \\Delta\\psi_s}{k_B T}$$\nThe required change in surface potential, $\\Delta\\psi_s$, is therefore:\n$$\\Delta\\psi_s = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln(10)$$\nThe subthreshold swing $S$ is the corresponding change in gate voltage, $\\Delta V_g$. Using the body factor $m = \\Delta V_g / \\Delta\\psi_s$, we have:\n$$S = \\Delta V_g = m \\cdot \\Delta\\psi_s = m \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) \\ln(10)$$\nThis expression gives the subthreshold swing in volts per decade.\n\n### Capacitance Models\n\nThe problem specifies the capacitance models to be used. All capacitances are per unit area.\n\n- **Semiconductor Capacitance ($C_s$)**:\n  - For a bulk semiconductor: Debye capacitance, $C_D$.\n    $$C_s = C_D = \\frac{\\varepsilon_s}{L_D} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad L_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_s k_B T}{q^2 N}}$$\n    Here, $\\varepsilon_s$ is the absolute permittivity of the semiconductor ($\\varepsilon_{s,rel} \\cdot \\varepsilon_0$) and $N$ is the majority carrier density in $\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$.\n  - For a 2D channel: Quantum capacitance, $C_q$.\n    $$C_s = C_q = \\frac{q^2 n}{k_B T}$$\n    Here, $n$ is the residual carrier sheet density in $\\mathrm{m^{-2}}$.\n\n- **Total Gate Capacitance ($C_{g,tot}$)**:\n  - The oxide capacitance for a single gate is $C_{ox} = \\varepsilon_{ox}/t_{ox}$, where $\\varepsilon_{ox}$ is the absolute oxide permittivity ($\\varepsilon_{ox,rel} \\cdot \\varepsilon_0$) and $t_{ox}$ is the oxide thickness.\n  - For a multi-gate device with $G$ identical gates, the total capacitance is the parallel sum: $C_{g,tot} = G \\cdot C_{\\text{single gate}}$.\n  - For a standard gate, $C_{\\text{single gate}} = C_{ox}$.\n  - For a Negative Capacitance (NC) gate stack, the effective single-gate capacitance is a series combination of $C_{ox}$ and the ferroelectric capacitance $C_{fe}$:\n    $$C_{g,eff} = \\left(\\frac{1}{C_{ox}} + \\frac{1}{C_{fe}}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{C_{ox}C_{fe}}{C_{ox}+C_{fe}}$$\n    So, for an NC-FET, $C_{g,tot} = G \\cdot C_{g,eff}$.\n\n### Calculation Procedure\n\nFor each device, we will execute the following steps:\n1.  Convert all given parameters to base SI units (e.g., $\\mathrm{nm} \\to \\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\to \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, $\\mathrm{cm^{-2}} \\to \\mathrm{m^{-2}}$).\n2.  Calculate the semiconductor capacitance per unit area, $C_s$, using the appropriate model ($C_D$ or $C_q$).\n3.  Calculate the total gate capacitance per unit area, $C_{g,tot}$, based on the device structure (number of gates, presence of an NC layer).\n4.  Compute the body factor $m = 1 + C_s / C_{g,tot}$.\n5.  Compute the subthreshold swing $S = m (k_B T / q) \\ln(10)$.\n6.  After computing $m$ and $S$ for all devices, they are ranked by increasing $S$.\n7.  The \"nonintuitive outcome\" is checked. For each device $i$, we check if there exists another device $j$ such that its geometric gate capacitance $C_{geom,i}$ is less than $C_{geom,j}$ while its subthreshold swing $S_i$ is also less than $S_j$. The geometric gate capacitance is defined as $C_{geom} = G \\cdot C_{ox}$, ignoring any ferroelectric effects.",
