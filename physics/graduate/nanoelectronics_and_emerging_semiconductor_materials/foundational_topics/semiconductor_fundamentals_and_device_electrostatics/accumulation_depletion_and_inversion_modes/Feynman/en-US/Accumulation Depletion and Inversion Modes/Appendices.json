It is a standard problem in semiconductor device physics that requires a formal derivation followed by a numerical calculation and a physical interpretation.\n\nPart (a): Derivation of the Fermi Potential $\\phi_F(T)$\n\nThe Fermi potential, $\\phi_F$, is defined relative to the intrinsic Fermi level, $E_i$. For a $p$-type semiconductor, the Fermi level $E_F$ is located in the lower half of the bandgap, below $E_i$. The potential is related to energy by the elementary charge $q$ as $\\phi = -E/q$.

The pre-logarithmic factor $k_B T/q$ increases linearly with $T$. However, the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i(T)$ increases exponentially with $T$. The exponential increase in $n_i$ is the dominant effect. As $n_i$ increases, the ratio $N_A/n_i$ decreases, causing its logarithm, $\\ln(N_A/n_i)$, to become smaller (less positive). The rapid decrease of the logarithm term outweighs the linear increase of the $k_B T/q$ factor, leading to an overall decrease in $\\phi_F$ as temperature rises.\n\nPhysically, $\\phi_F = (E_i - E_F)/q$ quantifies how far the Fermi level $E_F$ is from the intrinsic (mid-gap) level $E_i$. As temperature increases, more thermal energy is available to generate electron-hole pairs, causing the semiconductor to behave more like an intrinsic semiconductor. Consequently, the Fermi level $E_F$ in the $p$-type material moves upward, closer to $E_i$. This reduces the energy difference $(E_i - E_F)$ and, therefore, decreases the Fermi potential $\\phi_F$.\n\nThe boundaries of the accumulation, depletion, and inversion regimes are defined by the surface potential $\\psi_s$. The boundary between depletion and accumulation is at $\\psi_s = 0$, which is independent of temperature. However, the threshold for strong inversion is defined as $\\psi_s^{\\mathrm{inv}} = 2\\phi_F$. Since $\\phi_F$ decreases with increasing temperature, the surface potential required to achieve strong inversion also decreases. This means that at higher temperatures, inversion is reached with less band bending. Physically, because the material is already closer to being intrinsic, it takes less \"effort\" (in the form of an applied gate voltage and resulting surface potential) to bend the bands to the point where the surface minority carrier concentration (electrons) equals the bulk majority carrier concentration (holes), which is the criterion for strong inversion.",

It is a standard, solvable problem in solid-state electronics that tests fundamental understanding.

The problem specifies that the threshold condition, $\\psi_s = 2\\phi_F$, is the same for both the real and ideal cases. The quantity $\\phi_F$, the Fermi potential, depends only on the substrate doping $N_A$, and $\\Phi_{ms}$ depends on the gate and substrate materials. Thus, $\\psi_s$ and $\\Phi_{ms}$ are identical for both cases and will cancel out when calculating the shift. The shift arises solely from the change in the oxide voltage, $V_{ox}$, caused by the fixed charge $Q_f' = q N_f$.\n\nWe derive $V_{ox}$ from first principles by solving Poisson's equation in the oxide. The coordinate system places the Si-$\\text{SiO}_2$ interface at $x=0$ and the gate at $x=t_{\\text{ox}}$. The fixed charge is a sheet of charge density $\\rho_{\\text{ox}}(x) = Q_f' \\delta(x-x_f)$.\nPoisson's equation for the electric potential $\\psi(x)$ in the oxide is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho_{\\text{ox}}(x)}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}} = -\\frac{Q_f'}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}} \\delta(x-x_f) $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}} = \\varepsilon_{r,\\text{ox}}\\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of the oxide.\nThe electric field in the oxide is $E_{\\text{ox}}(x) = -\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}$. The change in the electric field is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dE_{\\text{ox}}}{dx} = \\frac{Q_f'}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}} \\delta(x-x_f) $$\nIntegrating this equation shows that the electric field is constant in the regions $0  x  x_f$ and $x_f  x  t_{\\text{ox}}$, with a discontinuity at $x=x_f$.\nLet $E_1$ be the field for $0  x  x_f$ and $E_2$ be the field for $x_f  x  t_{\\text{ox}}$.\n$E_2 - E_1 = \\frac{Q_f'}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}$.\nAt the Si-$\\text{SiO}_2$ interface ($x=0$), Gauss's law relates the electric field in the oxide to the total charge per unit area in the semiconductor, $Q_s'$. With interface traps being negligible:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}} E_{\\text{ox}}(x=0) - \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}} E_{\\text{si}}(x=0) = 0 $$\nThe field just inside the silicon, $E_{\\text{si}}(x=0)$, is related to the silicon charge by $E_{\\text{si}}(x=0) = Q_s' / \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}$.

The negative sign indicates that a positive fixed charge ($Q_f'0$) leads to a negative shift, i.e., a lower threshold voltage.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nFirst, we convert all given parameters to consistent SI units.\n-   $N_{f} = 1.2 \\times 10^{12} \\,\\text{cm}^{-2} = 1.2 \\times 10^{12} \\times (10^2)^2 \\,\\text{m}^{-2} = 1.2 \\times 10^{16} \\,\\text{m}^{-2}$.\n-   $t_{\\text{ox}} = 2.8 \\,\\text{nm} = 2.8 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\text{m}$.\n-   $x_{f} = 1.0 \\,\\text{nm} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\text{m}$.\n-   $q = 1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\text{C}$.\n-   $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}} = \\varepsilon_{r,\\text{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0} = 3.9 \\times (8.854\\,187\\,817 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\text{F/m}) \\approx 3.453133 \\times 10^{-11} \\,\\text{F/m}$.\n\nNow, we compute $\\Delta V_{th}$:\n$$ \\Delta V_{th} = - \\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\text{C}) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{16} \\,\\text{m}^{-2}) \\times (2.8 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\text{m} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\text{m})}{3.453133 \\times 10^{-11} \\,\\text{F/m}} $$\n$$ \\Delta V_{th} = - \\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{16}) \\times (1.8 \\times 10^{-9})}{3.453133 \\times 10^{-11}} \\,\\text{V} $$\n$$ \\Delta V_{th} = - \\frac{3.4607015 \\times 10^{-12}}{3.453133 \\times 10^{-11}} \\,\\text{V} \\approx -0.10021917 \\,\\text{V} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is:\n$$ \\Delta V_{th} \\approx -0.1002 \\,\\text{V} $$\n\n**Effect of Reducing Fixed Charge**\nThe relationship between the gate voltage $V_G$ and the surface potential $\\psi_s$ is given by:\n$$ V_G(\\psi_s) = \\Phi_{ms} + \\psi_s - \\frac{Q_s'(\\psi_s)}{C'_{\\text{ox}}} + \\Delta V_{th}(N_f) $$\nwhere $\\Delta V_{th}(N_f) = - \\frac{q N_f (t_{\\text{ox}} - x_f)}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}$. The regimes of accumulation ($\\psi_s  0$), depletion ($0  \\psi_s  2\\phi_F$), and inversion ($\\psi_s \\ge 2\\phi_F$) are defined by the value of $\\psi_s$. To reach a specific regime, a certain $\\psi_s$ must be established, which in turn requires a specific $V_G$.\nThe term $\\Delta V_{th}$ acts as a voltage offset that depends on $N_f$. For a positive fixed charge ($N_f  0$), $\\Delta V_{th}$ is negative. If processing steps such as thermal annealing reduce the density of this positive fixed charge, $N_f$ decreases. As $N_f$ decreases toward zero, the negative offset $\\Delta V_{th}$ becomes smaller in magnitude (i.e., it increases toward zero).\nTo maintain the same surface potential $\\psi_s$, the required gate voltage $V_G$ must increase as $N_f$ is reduced. This means the entire $V_G(\\psi_s)$ curve, and consequently the gate voltage values that mark the boundaries between the accumulation, depletion, and inversion regimes, shift to more positive voltages. A reduction in positive fixed charge makes it energetically \"harder\" (requires a more positive $V_G$) to attract electrons to the surface and cause inversion.",

            "solution": "The problem is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in semiconductor device physics, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard scenario for analyzing MOSFET characteristics using C-V data. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided, and they are physically realistic.\n\nThe first step is to determine the inversion charge density per unit area, which we denote as $Q_i(V_G)$, from the given gate-to-channel incremental capacitance per unit area, $C_{gc}(V_G)$. In the quasi-static approximation, the capacitance is the derivative of the charge with respect to the voltage. For the gate-to-channel capacitance, this relationship is given by:\n$$\nC_{gc}(V_G) = \\frac{dQ_i(V_G)}{dV_G}\n$$\nHere, $Q_i$ represents the magnitude of the inversion charge density (electrons in the p-type substrate). To find the total inversion charge density at a given gate voltage $V_G$, we must integrate the capacitance from the point where inversion charge begins to form, which is the threshold voltage $V_{th}$. At $V_G = V_{th}$, the inversion charge density is $Q_i(V_{th}) = 0$.\n$$\nQ_{i,\\mathrm{split}}(V_G) = \\int_{V_{th}}^{V_G} C_{gc}(V'_G) dV'_G\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for $C_{gc}(V_G)$:\n$$\nQ_{i,\\mathrm{split}}(V_G) = \\int_{V_{th}}^{V_G} C_{ox}\\left(1 - \\exp\\!\\big(-\\alpha\\,[V'_G - V_{th}]\\big)\\right) dV'_G\n$$\nWe can perform the integration:\n$$\nQ_{i,\\mathrm{split}}(V_G) = C_{ox} \\left[ \\int_{V_{th}}^{V_G} 1 \\,dV'_G - \\int_{V_{th}}^{V_G} \\exp\\!\\big(-\\alpha\\,[V'_G - V_{th}]\\big) dV'_G \\right]\n$$\n$$\nQ_{i,\\mathrm{split}}(V_G) = C_{ox} \\left[ V'_G \\bigg|_{V_{th}}^{V_G} - \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\right) \\exp\\!\\big(-\\alpha\\,[V'_G - V_{th}]\\big) \\bigg|_{V_{th}}^{V_G} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nQ_{i,\\mathrm{split}}(V_G) = C_{ox} \\left[ (V_G - V_{th}) + \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\exp\\!\\big(-\\alpha\\,[V_G - V_{th}]\\big) - \\exp\\!\\big(-\\alpha\\,[V_{th} - V_{th}]\\big) \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nQ_{i,\\mathrm{split}}(V_G) = C_{ox} \\left[ (V_G - V_{th}) + \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\exp\\!\\big(-\\alpha\\,[V_G - V_{th}]\\big) - 1 \\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the definition of the gate overdrive voltage, $V_{ov} \\equiv V_G - V_{th}$, we can write the inversion charge from the split C–V measurement as a function of $V_{ov}$:\n$$\nQ_{i,\\mathrm{split}}(V_{ov}) = C_{ox} \\left[ V_{ov} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\exp(-\\alpha V_{ov}) - 1 \\right) \\right]\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the prediction of the classical charge-sheet model. In this model, for a gate voltage above the threshold voltage ($V_G  V_{th}$), the inversion charge layer is treated as an infinitesimally thin sheet at the semiconductor-oxide interface. It assumes a sharp turn-on at $V_{th}$, and for any increase in gate voltage beyond $V_{th}$, the additional charge induced in the semiconductor is entirely inversion charge. The depletion charge is assumed to be constant at its maximum value for $V_G \\geq V_{th}$. This leads to a simple linear relationship between the inversion charge density and the gate overdrive voltage:\n$$\nQ_{i,\\mathrm{CS}}(V_{ov}) = C_{ox} (V_G - V_{th}) = C_{ox} V_{ov}\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the fractional deviation $\\delta(V_{ov})$ as defined in the problem statement:\n$$\n\\delta(V_{ov}) = \\frac{Q_{i,\\mathrm{CS}}(V_{ov}) - Q_{i,\\mathrm{split}}(V_{ov})}{Q_{i,\\mathrm{CS}}(V_{ov})}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for $Q_{i,\\mathrm{CS}}$ and $Q_{i,\\mathrm{split}}$:\n$$\n\\delta(V_{ov}) = \\frac{C_{ox} V_{ov} - C_{ox} \\left[ V_{ov} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\exp(-\\alpha V_{ov}) - 1 \\right) \\right]}{C_{ox} V_{ov}}\n$$\nThe terms $C_{ox}$ and $C_{ox}V_{ov}$ in the numerator cancel out:\n$$\n\\delta(V_{ov}) = \\frac{- \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\exp(-\\alpha V_{ov}) - 1 \\right)}{V_{ov}}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta(V_{ov}) = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha V_{ov})}{\\alpha V_{ov}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the fractional deviation as a function of the gate overdrive $V_{ov}$ and the empirical parameter $\\alpha$. Notice that it is independent of the oxide capacitance $C_{ox}$, the oxide thickness $t_{ox}$, and the threshold voltage $V_{th}$ itself.\n\nThe problem asks for the evaluation of this quantity at $V_{ov} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{V}$ with the given parameter $\\alpha = 20\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}$. First, we calculate the dimensionless product $\\alpha V_{ov}$:\n$$\n\\alpha V_{ov} = (20\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}) \\times (0.05\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting this value into our expression for $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\delta(0.05\\,\\mathrm{V}) = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-1)}{1} = 1 - e^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n1 - e^{-1} \\approx 1 - 0.36787944... = 0.63212055...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $6$, $3$, $2$, and $1$. The fifth digit is $2$, so we round down.\n$$\n\\delta(0.05\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\approx 0.6321\n$$",
