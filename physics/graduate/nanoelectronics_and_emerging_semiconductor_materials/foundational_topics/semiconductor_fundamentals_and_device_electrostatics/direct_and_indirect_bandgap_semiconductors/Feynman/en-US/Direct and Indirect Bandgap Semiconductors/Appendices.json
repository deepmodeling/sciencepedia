There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe attenuation of light intensity, $I$, as it propagates through a homogeneous absorbing medium is governed by the Beer-Lambert law. In differential form, the change in intensity $dI$ over an infinitesimal path length $dz$ is proportional to the local intensity $I(z)$ and the absorption coefficient $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\frac{dI(z)}{dz} = -\\alpha I(z)\n$$\nTo find the intensity after passing through a material of thickness $L$, we integrate this equation. We separate the variables and integrate from the incident surface ($z=0$, where intensity is $I_0$) to the exit surface ($z=L$, where intensity is $I(L)$):\n$$\n\\int_{I_0}^{I(L)} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = \\int_{0}^{L} -\\alpha \\, dz'\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ is assumed to be spatially uniform, it can be treated as a constant during integration:\n$$\n[\\ln(I')]_{I_0}^{I(L)} = -\\alpha [z']_{0}^{L}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(I(L)) - \\ln(I_0) = -\\alpha L\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{I(L)}{I_0}\\right) = -\\alpha L\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the expression for the transmitted intensity $I(L)$:\n$$\nI(L) = I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha L)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the absorption fraction, $\\mathcal{A}$. The total absorbed intensity, $I_{\\text{abs}}$, is the incident intensity minus the transmitted intensity: $I_{\\text{abs}} = I_0 - I(L)$. The absorption fraction is the ratio of absorbed intensity to incident intensity:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} = \\frac{I_{\\text{abs}}}{I_0} = \\frac{I_0 - I(L)}{I_0} = 1 - \\frac{I(L)}{I_0}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I(L)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} = 1 - \\frac{I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha L)}{I_0} = 1 - \\exp(-\\alpha L)\n$$\nWe need to solve for the thickness $L$ required to achieve a specific absorption fraction $\\mathcal{A}$. Rearranging the equation:\n$$\n\\exp(-\\alpha L) = 1 - \\mathcal{A}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\alpha L = \\ln(1 - \\mathcal{A})\n$$\nFinally, solving for $L$:\n$$\nL = -\\frac{\\ln(1 - \\mathcal{A})}{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\ln\\left((1 - \\mathcal{A})^{-1}\\right)}{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - \\mathcal{A}}\\right)}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis is the general formula for the required thickness. We now apply it to Material D and Material I using the provided data. The target absorption fraction is $\\mathcal{A} = 0.9$. The numerical value of the logarithmic term is:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - 0.9}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.1}\\right) = \\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585...\n$$\nFor Material D (direct bandgap), the absorption coefficient is $\\alpha_{D} = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The required thickness, $L_D$, is:\n$$\nL_D = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\alpha_{D}} = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{5.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}} \\approx 4.60517 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{cm}\n$$\nFor Material I (indirect bandgap), the absorption coefficient is $\\alpha_{I} = 2.0 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.

It is a standard problem in semiconductor physics that can be solved using the provided information and established theories.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Out-of-Plane Strain $\\epsilon_{zz}$\n\nWe begin with Hooke's law for a cubic crystal, which relates the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ to the strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ via the elastic stiffness tensor $\\mathbf{C}$. For the principal stress and strain components along the cubic axes, the relations are:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = C_{11}\\epsilon_{xx} + C_{12}\\epsilon_{yy} + C_{12}\\epsilon_{zz} \\\\\n\\sigma_{yy} = C_{12}\\epsilon_{xx} + C_{11}\\epsilon_{yy} + C_{12}\\epsilon_{zz} \\\\\n\\sigma_{zz} = C_{12}\\epsilon_{xx} + C_{12}\\epsilon_{yy} + C_{11}\\epsilon_{zz}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a biaxial in-plane strain $\\epsilon_{xx} = \\epsilon_{yy} = \\epsilon_{\\parallel}$ with zero shear components. The film is free to relax in the out-of-plane direction, which corresponds to a plane-stress condition, $\\sigma_{zz}=0$.

Let's analyze the uniaxial term $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}$. Since $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is diagonal, this term simplifies to:\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} = n_x^2\\epsilon_{xx} + n_y^2\\epsilon_{yy} + n_z^2\\epsilon_{zz}\n$$\nFor any $\\langle 111 \\rangle$ direction, the squared components of the unit vector are $n_x^2 = n_y^2 = n_z^2 = (\\pm 1/\\sqrt{3})^2 = 1/3$.

It provides a self-contained set of parameters and conditions based on standard models of semiconductor device physics, allowing for the derivation of a unique and meaningful solution. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or scientifically implausible assumptions.\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady-state carrier continuity equation. In the active region of the Light-Emitting Diode (LED), under steady-state conditions, the rate of carrier injection must equal the rate of carrier recombination. The total recombination rate per unit volume, $R_{total}$, is the sum of the rates of all relevant recombination mechanisms. The problem specifies that we consider only radiative and Auger recombination, neglecting Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination. Thus,\n$$\nR_{total} = R_{rad} + R_{Aug}\n$$\nwhere $R_{rad}$ is the radiative recombination rate and $R_{Aug}$ is the Auger recombination rate, both per unit volume.\n\nThe problem states that the device operates under high-level injection such that the excess electron and hole densities are approximately equal, $n \\approx p \\equiv \\Delta n$.\n\nThe radiative recombination is bimolecular, and its rate is given by:\n$$\nR_{rad} = B n p\n$$\nUnder the high-level injection condition, this becomes:\n$$\nR_{rad} = B (\\Delta n)^2\n$$\nwhere $B = 5.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{cm}^3/\\text{s}$ is the bimolecular recombination coefficient.\n\nThe Auger recombination is a three-carrier process.

Therefore, the Auger recombination rate is:\n$$\nR_{Aug} = C (\\Delta n)^3\n$$\nwhere $C = 5.0 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\text{cm}^6/\\text{s}$ is the effective Auger recombination coefficient.\n\nThe crossover point is defined as the condition where the Auger recombination rate equals the radiative recombination rate.

In steady state, the total current injected into the active region is converted into recombination events. The total number of carriers recombining per unit area per second is given by the volume recombination rate $R_{total}$ multiplied by the thickness of the active region, $d$. Since the problem assumes uniform carrier density and recombination, this product is straightforward. The current density is then this rate multiplied by the elementary charge $q$.\n$$\nJ = q \\cdot d \\cdot R_{total} = q \\cdot d \\cdot (R_{rad} + R_{Aug})\n$$\nThe crossover current density, $J_c$, is the current density at which $\\Delta n = \\Delta n_c$.

Using the expression for $R_{rad}$:\n$$\nJ_c = q \\cdot d \\cdot [2 R_{rad}(\\Delta n_c)] = 2 q d B (\\Delta n_c)^2\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the crossover carrier density, $\\Delta n_c = B/C$:\n$$\nJ_c = 2 q d B \\left(\\frac{B}{C}\\right)^2 = 2 q d \\frac{B^3}{C^2}\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n$q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}$\n$d = 10\\,\\text{nm} = 10 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{cm} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{cm}$\n$B = 5.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{cm}^3/\\text{s}$\n$C = 5.0 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\text{cm}^6/\\text{s}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $J_c$:\n$$\nJ_c = 2 \\cdot (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}) \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{cm}) \\cdot \\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{cm}^3/\\text{s})^3}{(5.0 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\text{cm}^6/\\text{s})^2}\n$$\nLet's compute the terms:\n$$\nB^3 = (5.0 \\times 10^{-11})^3 = 125 \\times 10^{-33} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\text{cm}^9/\\text{s}^3\n$$\n$$\nC^2 = (5.0 \\times 10^{-29})^2 = 25 \\times 10^{-58} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-57}\\,\\text{cm}^{12}/\\text{s}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{B^3}{C^2} = \\frac{1.25 \\times 10^{-31}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-57}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{26} = 5.0 \\times 10^{25}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, complete the calculation for $J_c$:\n$$\nJ_c = 2 \\cdot (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\cdot (5.0 \\times 10^{25})\n$$\n$$\nJ_c = (2 \\cdot 1.602 \\cdot 1.0 \\cdot 5.0) \\times 10^{-19} \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10^{25}\n$$\n$$\nJ_c = 16.02 \\times 10^{(-19-6+25)} = 16.02 \\times 10^{0}\n$$\n$$\nJ_c = 16.02\\,\\text{A/cm}^2\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nJ_c \\approx 16.0\\,\\text{A/cm}^2\n$$",
