A critical parameter is the minority carrier diffusion length ($L$), which dictates how far these carriers can travel before recombining. This practice provides a concrete application of the Einstein relation by connecting microscopic transport properties, such as mobility ($\\mu$) and lifetime ($\\tau$), to this crucial macroscopic parameter. By working through this problem, you will not only derive the fundamental relationship between drift and diffusion but also use it to quantify and interpret the significant differences in the transport \"reach\" of electrons and holes in silicon.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of semiconductor physics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated. It is a standard problem in the field of nanoelectronics and requires a rigorous application of fundamental concepts.\n\nWe begin by deriving the Einstein relation, which connects the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the mobility $\\mu$ for charge carriers. The total current density for a carrier species, for instance electrons, is the sum of the drift current density $J_{n,\\text{drift}}$ due to an electric field $\\mathcal{E}$ and the diffusion current density $J_{n,\\text{diff}}$ due to a concentration gradient $\\nabla n$. In one dimension, this is expressed as:\n$$J_{n}(x) = J_{n,\\text{drift}}(x) + J_{n,\\text{diff}}(x)$$\nThe fundamental definitions for these components are:\n$$J_{n,\\text{drift}}(x) = q n(x) \\mu_{n} \\mathcal{E}(x)$$\n$$J_{n,\\text{diff}}(x) = q D_{n} \\frac{dn(x)}{dx}$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $n(x)$ is the electron concentration, $\\mu_{n}$ is the electron mobility, and $D_{n}$ is the electron diffusion coefficient. The total electron current density is thus:\n$$J_{n}(x) = q n(x) \\mu_{n} \\mathcal{E}(x) + q D_{n} \\frac{dn(x)}{dx}$$\nAt thermal equilibrium, there can be no net flow of charge carriers. Therefore, the total current density for each carrier type must be identically zero everywhere, i.e., $J_{n}(x) = 0$. This condition implies a balance between the drift and diffusion components:\n$$q n(x) \\mu_{n} \\mathcal{E}(x) + q D_{n} \\frac{dn(x)}{dx} = 0$$\nAt thermal equilibrium, the electrochemical potential, or Fermi level $E_{F}$, is constant throughout the semiconductor. The electric field $\\mathcal{E}(x)$ is related to the gradient of the electrostatic potential $\\phi(x)$, $\\mathcal{E}(x) = -\\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx}$. The potential energy of an electron is $E(x) = -q\\phi(x)$, which corresponds to the energy of the conduction band edge, $E_c(x)$, relative to some reference. Thus, we can write the electric field in terms of the conduction band energy gradient:\n$$\\mathcal{E}(x) = \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{dE_c(x)}{dx}$$\nSubstituting this into the zero-current equation gives:\n$$n(x) \\mu_{n} \\frac{dE_c(x)}{dx} + q D_{n} \\frac{dn(x)}{dx} = 0$$\nThe problem states that the semiconductor is non-degenerate. In this regime, the electron concentration $n(x)$ can be described by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics:\n$$n(x) = N_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{c}(x) - E_{F}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nwhere $N_{c}$ is the effective density of states in the conduction band, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Since $E_F$ is spatially invariant at equilibrium, we can differentiate $n(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{dn(x)}{dx} = N_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{c}(x) - E_{F}}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{1}{k_{B}T}\\right)\\frac{dE_{c}(x)}{dx} = -\\frac{n(x)}{k_{B}T}\\frac{dE_{c}(x)}{dx}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\frac{dn(x)}{dx}$ back into the zero-current balance equation:\n$$n(x) \\mu_{n} \\frac{dE_c(x)}{dx} + q D_{n} \\left(-\\frac{n(x)}{k_{B}T}\\frac{dE_{c}(x)}{dx}\\right) = 0$$\nAssuming a non-trivial built-in field, we have $\\frac{dE_c(x)}{dx} \\neq 0$. We can therefore divide the entire equation by the common factor $n(x)\\frac{dE_c(x)}{dx}$:\n$$\\mu_{n} - \\frac{q D_{n}}{k_{B}T} = 0$$\nRearranging this equation yields the Einstein relation for electrons:\n$$\\frac{D_{n}}{\\mu_{n}} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{q}$$\nAn analogous derivation for holes, starting from $J_{p}(x) = q p(x) \\mu_{p} \\mathcal{E}(x) - q D_{p} \\frac{dp(x)}{dx} = 0$, yields the same relation for holes, $\\frac{D_{p}}{\\mu_{p}} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{q}$. The quantity $\\frac{k_{B}T}{q}$ is known as the thermal voltage, $V_{th}$. This completes the required derivation.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute the minority-carrier diffusion lengths, $L_{n}$ and $L_{p}$. The diffusion length $L$ is given by the formula $L = \\sqrt{D\\tau}$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $\\tau$ is the minority-carrier lifetime.\nThe diffusion length for electrons (minority carriers in the $p$-type region) is:\n$$L_{n} = \\sqrt{D_{n}\\tau_{n}}$$\nThe diffusion length for holes (minority carriers in the $n$-type region) is:\n$$L_{p} = \\sqrt{D_{p}\\tau_{p}}$$\nUsing the Einstein relation, we can express the diffusion coefficients in terms of the given mobilities and the thermal voltage:\n$$D_{n} = \\mu_{n} \\frac{k_{B}T}{q}$$\n$$D_{p} = \\mu_{p} \\frac{k_{B}T}{q}$$\nSubstituting these into the expressions for the diffusion lengths:\n$$L_{n} = \\sqrt{\\mu_{n} \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} \\tau_{n}}$$\n$$L_{p} = \\sqrt{\\mu_{p} \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} \\tau_{p}}$$\nWe are required to find the ratio $L_{n}/L_{p}$. Taking the ratio of the two expressions above:\n$$\\frac{L_{n}}{L_{p}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu_{n} \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} \\tau_{n}}}{\\sqrt{\\mu_{p} \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} \\tau_{p}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{n} \\tau_{n}}{\\mu_{p} \\tau_{p}}}$$\nThis symbolic expression shows that the ratio of diffusion lengths is independent of temperature and fundamental constants, depending only on the ratios of the respective mobilities and lifetimes.\nWe now substitute the provided numerical values:\n$\\mu_{n} = 1350\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})$\n$\\mu_{p} = 480\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})$\n$\\tau_{n} = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 200 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$\\tau_{p} = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\n$$\\frac{L_{n}}{L_{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1350\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})) \\times (200 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s})}{(480\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1350 \\times 200}{480 \\times 50}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{270000}{24000}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{27}{2.4}} = \\sqrt{11.25}$$\nThe exact value of the ratio is $\\sqrt{11.25} = \\sqrt{\\frac{45}{4}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\nNumerically, this value is:\n$$\\frac{L_{n}}{L_{p}} \\approx 3.354101966...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $3.354$.\n\nThe interpretation of this ratio, $L_{n}/L_{p} \\approx 3.354 > 1$, is that the average distance an electron can diffuse in $p$-type silicon before recombining is approximately $3.35$ times greater than the distance a hole can diffuse in $n$-type silicon. This significant difference is a direct consequence of two contributing factors evident in the ratio formula $\\sqrt{(\\mu_n/\\mu_p)(\\tau_n/\\tau_p)}$. First, the electron mobility is substantially higher than the hole mobility in silicon ($\\mu_n/\\mu_p = 1350/480 = 2.8125$). Second, the specified minority-carrier lifetime for electrons is longer than that for holes ($\\tau_n/\\tau_p = 200/50 = 4$). Both factors combine to give minority electrons a much greater \"reach\" than minority holes, a property of critical importance in the design and performance of many semiconductor devices, such as bipolar junction transistors and photodetectors, where efficient minority-carrier transport and collection are paramount.\n\nTo be complete, we can also calculate the individual diffusion coefficients and lengths.\nThe thermal voltage at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is:\n$$V_{th} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe diffusion coefficients are:\n$$D_{n} = \\mu_{n} V_{th} = (1350\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}))(0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\approx 34.90\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$D_{p} = \\mu_{p} V_{th} = (480\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}))(0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\approx 12.41\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe diffusion lengths are:\n$$L_{n} = \\sqrt{D_{n}\\tau_{n}} = \\sqrt{(34.90\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s})(200 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s})} \\approx \\sqrt{0.00698\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2} \\approx 0.0835\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 835\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$L_{p} = \\sqrt{D_{p}\\tau_{p}} = \\sqrt{(12.41\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s})(50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s})} \\approx \\sqrt{0.0006205\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2} \\approx 0.0249\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 249\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe ratio is $\\frac{L_n}{L_p} = \\frac{0.0835}{0.0249} \\approx 3.3534$, which confirms our more direct calculation.

Thus, the total current is\n$$\nJ_{n} = q\\,n\\,\\mu\\,E + q\\,D\\,\\nabla n\n$$\nMore fundamentally, in the drift-diffusion model under conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium, the net current is driven by the spatial gradient of the electrochemical potential, here denoted by $\\eta$ for electrons (also known as the quasi-Fermi level, $E_{Fn}$). The relationship is\n$$\nJ_{n} = n\\,\\mu\\,\\nabla \\eta\n$$\nThe electrochemical potential $\\eta$ is composed of two parts: the electrostatic potential energy, $-q\\phi$, and the chemical potential, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}$, which depends on the electron concentration $n$ and temperature $T$.\n$$\n\\eta(x) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}(n(x), T) - q\\,\\phi(x)\n$$\nThe electric field is defined as the negative gradient of the electrostatic potential, $E = -\\nabla\\phi$. Taking the gradient of the electrochemical potential, we have:\n$$\n\\nabla \\eta = \\nabla \\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}} - q\\,\\nabla \\phi = \\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{dn}\\nabla n + q\\,E\n$$\nHere we have used the chain rule for $\\nabla \\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ assuming the temperature $T$ is uniform.

It is proportional to the rate of change of the electron chemical potential with respect to the logarithm of the electron concentration, since $\\frac{n}{q}\\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{dn} = \\frac{1}{q}\\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{d(\\ln n)}$. This quantity measures the resistance of the electron gas to compression; a larger value indicates that a larger change in chemical potential is required for a given fractional change in concentration.\n\nIn a non-degenerate semiconductor, the electron statistics follow the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation. The electron concentration is related to the chemical potential $\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}} = E_F - E_c$ by $n = N_c \\exp(\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}/(k_B T))$, where $N_c$ is the effective density of states in the conduction band.

Explanation of Deviations of $R$ from Unity**\n\nThe deviation of the calculated ratio $R = 2.268$ from unity is a direct manifestation of quantum statistics and band structure effects in the degenerate InAs nanowire.\n\n**Fermi-Dirac Degeneracy**: For a degenerate semiconductor, where the Fermi level $E_F$ lies within the conduction band, the electron population is described by Fermi-Dirac statistics, not Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. As derived earlier, the generalized ratio is $R = \\frac{(D/\\mu)}{k_B T/q} = \\frac{n}{k_B T} \\frac{d\\mu_{chem}}{dn}$. For a parabolic conduction band, this ratio can be expressed in terms of Fermi-Dirac integrals:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\mathcal{F}_{1/2}(\\eta_F)}{\\mathcal{F}_{-1/2}(\\eta_F)}\n$$\nwhere $\\eta_F = (E_F - E_c)/(k_B T)$ is the reduced Fermi energy. In the non-degenerate limit ($\\eta_F \\ll 0$), $\\mathcal{F}_{j}(\\eta_F) \\approx \\exp(\\eta_F)$, so $R \\approx 1$. In the degenerate limit ($\\eta_F > 0$), the Pauli exclusion principle means that electrons occupy states up to $E_F$, and adding more electrons requires placing them at higher energies, leading to a rapid increase in chemical potential. Mathematically, for $\\eta_F > 0$, $\\mathcal{F}_{1/2}(\\eta_F) / \\mathcal{F}_{-1/2}(\\eta_F) > 1$. Thus, a value of $R > 1$ is a clear signature of Fermi-Dirac degeneracy. The high donor concentration $N_D = 8 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ ensures the electron gas in InAs is degenerate, which is consistent with the observed result $R > 1$.\n\n**Conduction-Band Nonparabolicity**: The derivation leading to the expression with Fermi-Dirac integrals assumes a parabolic band structure, i.e., $g(E) \\propto \\sqrt{E - E_c}$. InAs is a narrow-gap semiconductor known for its highly nonparabolic conduction band. The energy-momentum relationship deviates from the simple parabolic form, especially at higher energies. A common model (Kane's model) leads to a density of states $g(E)$ that increases with energy more rapidly than in the parabolic case.\n\nThis has a direct impact on the generalized Einstein relation. The relation $D/\\mu = (n/q)(d\\mu_{chem}/dn)$ remains valid, but the connection between $n$ and $\\mu_{chem}$ changes. Because the density of states is larger in a non-parabolic band, a given electron concentration $n$ can be accommodated with a smaller value of the chemical potential $\\mu_{chem} = E_F - E_c$ compared to a parabolic band. Consequently, the derivative $d\\mu_{chem}/dn$ is smaller for the non-parabolic case than for the parabolic case at the same electron concentration. This means that, for a given level of degeneracy (i.e., a given $n$), non-parabolicity tends to reduce the value of the ratio $D/\\mu$ and hence reduces $R$. The measured value $R = 2.268$ is therefore the result of two competing effects: strong degeneracy which increases $R$ significantly above $1$, and conduction-band nonparabolicity which reduces $R$ from the value it would have had in a purely parabolic band with the same electron concentration.",

The total one-dimensional electrical current density $J_x$ for carriers of charge $q$ (we will use $q$ as the elementary charge magnitude, and for electrons the charge is $-q$) and concentration $n$ is the sum of the drift and diffusion current densities:\n$$\nJ_x = J_{\\mathrm{drift}} + J_{\\mathrm{diffusion}}\n$$\nThe drift current density is driven by the electric field $E_x = -\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$, where $\\phi$ is the electrostatic potential. It is given by $J_{\\mathrm{drift}} = n(-q)v_x$, where the drift velocity for electrons is $v_x = -\\mu E_x$. Thus, $J_{\\mathrm{drift}} = nq\\mu E_x = -nq\\mu \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$.\nThe diffusion current density is driven by the concentration gradient $\\frac{dn}{dx}$. The particle flux is $-D\\frac{dn}{dx}$, so for charge carriers with charge $-q$, the current density is $J_{\\mathrm{diffusion}} = (-q) \\left(-D \\frac{dn}{dx}\\right) = qD \\frac{dn}{dx}$.\nCombining these, the total current density is:\n$$\nJ_x = -nq\\mu \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} + qD \\frac{dn}{dx}\n$$\nIn local thermodynamic equilibrium, two conditions must be met. First, the net current must be zero, $J_x=0$. Second, the electrochemical potential $\\mu_{ec}$ must be constant throughout the system, meaning its spatial gradient is zero, $\\frac{d\\mu_{ec}}{dx}=0$.\n\nThe electrochemical potential for the charge carriers is $\\mu_{ec} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}} - q\\phi$, where $\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ is the chemical potential, which is a function of the carrier density $n$. The condition $\\frac{d\\mu_{ec}}{dx}=0$ implies:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}(n) - q\\phi) = 0\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{dx} = \\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{dn} \\frac{dn}{dx}$. Substituting this into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{dn} \\frac{dn}{dx} - q \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = 0 \\implies q \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = \\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{dn} \\frac{dn}{dx}\n$$\nNow, we apply the zero-current condition, $J_x=0$, to the total current expression:\n$$\n-nq\\mu \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} + qD \\frac{dn}{dx} = 0 \\implies n\\mu \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = D \\frac{dn}{dx}\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $q\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$ from the constant electrochemical potential condition into the zero-current equation. First, we write $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = \\frac{1}{q}\\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{dn} \\frac{dn}{dx}$:\n$$\nn\\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{q}\\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{dn} \\frac{dn}{dx} \\right) = D \\frac{dn}{dx}\n$$\nFor an inhomogeneous system with a non-zero concentration gradient ($\\frac{dn}{dx} \\neq 0$), we can cancel the $\\frac{dn}{dx}$ terms:\n$$\n\\frac{n\\mu}{q} \\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{dn} = D\n$$\nRearranging this equation yields the generalized Einstein relation:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{\\mu} = \\frac{n}{q} \\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{dn}\n$$\nThis relation connects the transport coefficients $D$ and $\\mu$ to the thermodynamic property $\\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{dn}$, and it is valid for both degenerate and non-degenerate systems.\n\nNext, we relate this expression to the concept of quantum capacitance. The quantum capacitance per unit area, $C_Q$, reflects the energy cost of adding carriers to the system due to the density of states. It is defined as the change in sheet charge density, $\\sigma = qn$, with respect to the potential associated with the chemical potential, $V_{\\mathrm{chem}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}/q$:\n$$\nC_Q = \\frac{d\\sigma}{dV_{\\mathrm{chem}}} = \\frac{d(qn)}{d(\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}/q)} = q^2 \\frac{dn}{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}\n$$\nFrom this definition, we find the derivative $\\frac{d\\mu_{\\mathrm{chem}}}{dn} = \\frac{q^2}{C_Q}$. Substituting this into the generalized Einstein relation:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{\\mu} = \\frac{n}{q} \\left( \\frac{q^2}{C_Q} \\right) = \\frac{nq}{C_Q}\n$$\nThe problem states that the measured total capacitance per unit area, $C_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the series combination of the geometric capacitance per unit area, $C_{\\mathrm{geom}}$, and the quantum capacitance per unit area, $C_Q$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{geom}}} + \\frac{1}{C_Q}\n$$\nWe can solve for $1/C_Q$, which appears in our expression for $D/\\mu$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_Q} = \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{tot}}} - \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{geom}}}\n$$\nThe geometric capacitance is that of a parallel plate capacitor, given by $C_{\\mathrm{geom}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{diel}}}{t}$, where the dielectric permittivity is $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{diel}} = \\kappa \\varepsilon_0$. Thus, $C_{\\mathrm{geom}} = \\frac{\\kappa \\varepsilon_0}{t}$.\nSubstituting these results into the expression for $D/\\mu$:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{\\mu} = nq \\left(\\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{tot}}} - \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{geom}}}\\right) = nq \\left(\\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{tot}}} - \\frac{t}{\\kappa \\varepsilon_0}\\right)\n$$\nThis final expression relates $D/\\mu$ to the experimentally provided quantities.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value. The given parameters are:\n$n = 4.00 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n$C_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}^2$\n$\\kappa = 9.00$\n$t = 5.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$\\varepsilon_{0} = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}$\nThe elementary charge is $q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the inverse of the geometric capacitance per unit area:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{geom}}} = \\frac{t}{\\kappa \\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{5.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{9.00 \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m})} \\approx 62.746\\ \\mathrm{m^2/F}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the term in parentheses:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{tot}}} - \\frac{t}{\\kappa \\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{1}{1.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}^2} - 62.746\\ \\mathrm{m^2/F} = (100.0 - 62.746)\\ \\mathrm{m^2/F} = 37.254\\ \\mathrm{m^2/F}\n$$\nThen, we calculate the sheet charge density $\\sigma = nq$:\n$$\n\\sigma = nq = (4.00 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}) \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}) = 6.408 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{C/m}^2\n$$\nNow, we can compute the ratio $D/\\mu$:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{\\mu} = (6.408 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{C/m}^2) \\times (37.254\\ \\mathrm{m^2/F}) \\approx 0.2387\\ \\mathrm{C/F}\n$$\nThe unit of Coulomb per Farad ($C/F$) is equivalent to a Volt ($V$), since capacitance is defined as $C = Q/V$.\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as justified by the precision of the input data:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{\\mu} \\approx 0.239\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$",
