The material is doped with both donors ($N_D$) and acceptors ($N_A$), a situation known as compensation doping.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement.\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Material: wurtzite gallium nitride (GaN)\n- Temperature: $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- Donor concentration: $N_{D} = 1.10 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- Acceptor concentration: $N_{A} = 1.00 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- Intrinsic carrier concentration: $n_{i} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- Assumptions:\n    1.

It describes a standard scenario of a compensated semiconductor at room temperature. The given values for dopant concentrations are typical, and the extremely low intrinsic carrier concentration is characteristic of a wide-bandgap semiconductor like GaN ($E_g \\approx 3.4\\,\\mathrm{eV}$). The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary information and assumptions (full ionization, thermal equilibrium, non-degeneracy) to determine a unique solution. The language is objective and quantitative. There are no scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is based on two fundamental principles of semiconductor physics at thermal equilibrium: the charge neutrality condition and the law of mass action.\n\n1.  **Charge Neutrality Condition**: In any region of a semiconductor in thermal equilibrium, the total positive charge density must equal the total negative charge density. The charged species are electrons (concentration $n$, charge $-e$), holes (concentration $p$, charge $+e$), ionized donors (concentration $N_D^+$, charge $+e$), and ionized acceptors (concentration $N_A^-$, charge $-e$). The condition is:\n    $$p + N_D^+ = n + N_A^-$$\n    The problem states that all dopants are fully ionized, which means every donor atom has donated an electron and every acceptor atom has accepted an electron. Therefore, $N_D^+ = N_D$ and $N_A^- = N_A$. The charge neutrality equation becomes:\n    $$p + N_D = n + N_A$$\n    This can be rearranged to express the difference between the electron and hole concentrations in terms of the net doping concentration:\n    $$n - p = N_D - N_A$$\n\n2.  **Law of Mass Action**: For a semiconductor in thermal equilibrium, the product of the electron and hole concentrations is a constant that depends on the material and temperature, but not on the doping. This constant is the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i$.\n    $$np = n_i^2$$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $n$ and $p$. We can solve this system.\nFrom the charge neutrality relation, we have $p = n - (N_D - N_A)$. Substituting this into the mass action law gives:\n$$n \\left( n - (N_D - N_A) \\right) = n_i^2$$\nThis rearranges into a quadratic equation for the electron concentration $n$:\n$$n^2 - (N_D - N_A)n - n_i^2 = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b = -(N_D - N_A)$, and $c = -n_i^2$, we find the solutions for $n$. Since $n$ must be a positive concentration, we take the positive root:\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\n\nLet's substitute the given numerical values:\n$N_D = 1.10 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$N_A = 1.00 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$n_i = 2.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n\nThe net effective doping concentration is:\n$$N_D - N_A = (1.10 - 1.00) \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 0.10 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nSince $N_D > N_A$, the material is n-type, and electrons are the majority carriers.\n\nNow, we evaluate the terms in the solution for $n$:\n$(N_D - N_A)^2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})^2 = 1.0 \\times 10^{30}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-6}$\n$4n_i^2 = 4 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})^2 = 4 \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-6}) = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-6}$\n\nClearly, $(N_D - N_A)^2 \\gg 4n_i^2$. This allows for a very accurate approximation:\n$$n \\approx \\frac{N_D - N_A + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2}}{2} = \\frac{N_D - N_A + (N_D - N_A)}{2} = N_D - N_A$$\nThus, the equilibrium electron concentration is:\n$$n \\approx 1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nTo be precise, we recognize that the problem asks for a final answer to four significant figures, so we treat the inputs as exact for calculation. Due to the vast difference in magnitude, the contribution of $n_i^2$ is negligible, and we can confidently state $n = N_D - N_A = 1.00 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ (using three significant figures from the subtraction $1.10-1.00=0.10$ which can be written as $1.00 \\times 10^{15}$).\nThe equilibrium hole concentration is then found from the mass action law:\n$$p = \\frac{n_i^2}{n} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})^2}{1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-6}}{1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-35}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nNext, we relate the Fermi level $E_F$ to the intrinsic level $E_i$. For a non-degenerate semiconductor, the electron concentration $n$ is given by:\n$$n = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_i}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. We can solve this equation for the energy difference $E_F - E_i$:\n$$\\frac{n}{n_i} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_i}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{n}{n_i}\\right) = \\frac{E_F - E_i}{k_B T}$$\n$$E_F - E_i = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n}{n_i}\\right)$$\nThis is the required relation. Since $n > n_i$, the argument of the logarithm is greater than $1$, its logarithm is positive, and thus $E_F > E_i$, which is consistent with an n-type semiconductor.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value. At $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the thermal energy is:\n$$k_B T \\approx (8.617333 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nThe ratio of electron concentration to intrinsic concentration is:\n$$\\frac{n}{n_i} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{24}$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $E_F - E_i$:\n$$E_F - E_i = (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times \\ln(5.0 \\times 10^{24})$$\n$$E_F - E_i \\approx (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times (56.871478)$$\n$$E_F - E_i \\approx 1.4704337\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures as requested:\n$$E_F - E_i = 1.470\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nThis large positive value indicates that the Fermi level is located high in the bandgap, close to the conduction band edge, as expected for a wide-bandgap n-type semiconductor. The non-degeneracy condition, $E_C - E_F \\gg k_B T$, is satisfied, as $E_C - E_i \\approx E_g/2 \\approx 1.7\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, which means $E_C - E_F \\approx 1.7\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 1.470\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.23\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, and $0.23\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ is approximately $9 \\times k_B T$.",

In thermal equilibrium, charge neutrality holds ($p_0 = n_0 + N_A$) and the mass-action law applies ($n_0 p_0 = n_i^2$). Substituting $n_0 = n_i^2/p_0$ into the equilibrium charge neutrality equation gives a quadratic equation for $p_0$:\n$$p_0 = \\frac{n_i^2}{p_0} + N_A \\implies p_0^2 - N_A p_0 - n_i^2 = 0$$\nThe physically meaningful solution for $p_0$ is:\n$$p_0 = \\frac{N_A + \\sqrt{N_A^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nGiven $N_A = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and $n_i = 1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, we have $N_A \\gg n_i$. Thus, we can approximate $p_0 \\approx N_A = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\nThe equilibrium electron concentration is $n_0 = n_i^2/p_0 \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{10})^2 / (1.0 \\times 10^{16}) = 1.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n\nNow, we can find the steady-state concentrations $n$ and $p$ under illumination using $\\Delta = 5.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$:\n$$n = n_0 + \\Delta \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^4) + (5.0 \\times 10^{16}) \\approx 5.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n$$p = p_0 + \\Delta \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{16}) + (5.0 \\times 10^{16}) = 6.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nThese values are consistent with the steady-state charge neutrality condition: $p = n + N_A \\implies 6.0 \\times 10^{16} = 5.0 \\times 10^{16} + 1.0 \\times 10^{16}$, which holds true. The condition $\\Delta > N_A$ indicates that the semiconductor is operating in the high-injection regime.\n\n**2. Quasi-Fermi Level Splitting**\nFor a non-degenerate semiconductor, the electron and hole concentrations can be expressed in terms of the quasi-Fermi levels $E_{Fn}$ and $E_{Fp}$ and the intrinsic Fermi level $E_i$:\n$$n = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn} - E_i}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$p = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_{Fp}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can express the quasi-Fermi levels as:\n$$E_{Fn} = E_i + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n}{n_i}\\right)$$\n$$E_{Fp} = E_i - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{n_i}\\right)$$\n\nThe quasi-Fermi level splitting, $\\Delta E_F = E_{Fn} - E_{Fp}$, is found by subtracting the two expressions:\n$$\\Delta E_F = \\left[E_i + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n}{n_i}\\right)\\right] - \\left[E_i - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{n_i}\\right)\\right]$$\n$$\\Delta E_F = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n}{n_i}\\right) + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{n_i}\\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) + \\ln(b) = \\ln(ab)$, we combine the terms:\n$$\\Delta E_F = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n \\cdot p}{n_i^2}\\right)$$\nThis expression relates the quasi-Fermi level splitting to the steady-state carrier concentrations and the intrinsic carrier density.\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\nWe now substitute the numerical values into the derived expression for $\\Delta E_F$.\n- $n = 5.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- $p = 6.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- $n_i = 1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- $k_B T = 0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n\nFirst, calculate the product $np$:\n$$np = (5.0 \\times 10^{16}) \\times (6.0 \\times 10^{16}) = 30.0 \\times 10^{32} = 3.0 \\times 10^{33}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-6}$$\nNext, calculate $n_i^2$:\n$$n_i^2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{10})^2 = 1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-6}$$\nThe ratio inside the logarithm is:\n$$\\frac{np}{n_i^2} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{33}}{1.0 \\times 10^{20}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{13}$$\nNow, compute the quasi-Fermi level splitting:\n$$\\Delta E_F = (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times \\ln(3.0 \\times 10^{13})$$\n$$\\Delta E_F \\approx (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times (31.032215)$$\n$$\\Delta E_F \\approx 0.802246\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$\\Delta E_F = 0.8022\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$",
