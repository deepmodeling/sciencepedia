            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the linearized, normalized Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential in a semiconductor and the identification of a dimensionless screening length parameter $\\,\\lambda\\,$. The solution will proceed in three stages: first, deriving the dimensional linearized Poisson equation; second, normalizing this equation using the provided scaling laws to find $\\,\\lambda\\,$; and third, interpreting the physical meaning of the screening length in the context of a 2D semiconductor channel.\n\nFirst, we begin with the one-dimensional Poisson equation, which is derived from Gauss's law for the electric field, $\\,\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\rho / \\epsilon\\,$, and the definition of the electrostatic potential, $\\,\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\phi\\,$. In one dimension, these combine to give:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe total charge density, $\\,\\rho\\,$, in the semiconductor is the sum of mobile charges (electrons and holes) and fixed ionized dopant charges ($N_D^+$, donors; $N_A^-$, acceptors).\n$$\n\\rho = q(p - n + N_D^+ - N_A^-)\n$$\nwhere $\\,q\\,$ is the elementary charge, $\\,p\\,$ is the hole density, and $\\,n\\,$ is the electron density.\n\nThe problem states the condition of local charge neutrality at equilibrium ($\\,\\phi=0\\,$), where the carrier densities are $\\,n_0\\,$ and $\\,p_0\\,$. At equilibrium, the net charge density is zero:\n$$\nq(p_0 - n_0 + N_D^+ - N_A^-) = 0\n$$\nThis allows us to express the net fixed dopant charge in terms of the equilibrium carrier concentrations:\n$$\nN_D^+ - N_A^- = n_0 - p_0\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the total charge density $\\,\\rho\\,$ gives:\n$$\n\\rho = q(p - n + n_0 - p_0)\n$$\nThe carrier densities $\\,n\\,$ and $\\,p\\,$ are dependent on the electrostatic potential $\\,\\phi\\,$ according to Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. With the potential $\\,\\phi\\,$ defined relative to the equilibrium state (where $\\,\\phi=0\\,$), the relations are:\n$$\nn = n_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\np = p_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\,k_B\\,$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\\,T\\,$ is the temperature.\n\nThe problem specifies that we consider small departures from equilibrium, meaning $\\,|q\\phi| \\ll k_B T\\,$. This allows for the linearization of the exponential terms using the Taylor series expansion $\\,\\exp(y) \\approx 1 + y\\,$ for small $\\,y\\,$.\n$$\nn \\approx n_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\np \\approx p_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting these linearized expressions into the equation for the charge density $\\,\\rho\\,$:\n$$\n\\rho \\approx q \\left[ p_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) - n_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{q\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) + n_0 - p_0 \\right]\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\n\\rho \\approx q \\left[ p_0 - \\frac{p_0 q\\phi}{k_B T} - n_0 - \\frac{n_0 q\\phi}{k_B T} + n_0 - p_0 \\right]\n$$\nThe zeroth-order terms cancel out: $\\,(p_0 - n_0 + n_0 - p_0) = 0\\,$. This is a crucial result, showing that the fixed background charge from dopants is exactly cancelled by the zeroth-order terms of the mobile carrier densities, resulting in a homogeneous differential equation. The linearized charge density is:\n$$\n\\rho \\approx -q \\left( \\frac{p_0 q\\phi}{k_B T} + \\frac{n_0 q\\phi}{k_B T} \\right) = - \\frac{q^2 (n_0 + p_0)}{k_B T} \\phi\n$$\nNow, we substitute this linearized charge density back into the one-dimensional Poisson equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\left( - \\frac{q^2 (n_0 + p_0)}{k_B T} \\phi \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = \\frac{q^2 (n_0 + p_0)}{\\epsilon k_B T} \\phi\n$$\nThis is the dimensional linearized Poisson equation, often known as the Debye-Hückel equation.

This implies that the collection of reference scales $\\,L_*\\,$, $\\,N_*\\,$, and $\\,\\epsilon_*\\,$ must be chosen in a specific, related manner. Let us define the \"reference length\" $\\,L_*\\,$ in terms of the \"reference permittivity\" $\\,\\epsilon_*\\,$ and \"reference density\" $\\,N_*\\,$ by constructing a characteristic length from them, analogous to the physical Debye length. We define $\\,L_*\\,$ such that:\n$$\nL_*^2 \\equiv \\frac{\\epsilon_* k_B T}{q^2 N_*}\n$$\nThis choice of $\\,L_*\\,$ establishes a self-consistent set of normalization scales. Substituting this definition of $\\,L_*^2\\,$ into the expression for $\\,1/\\lambda^2\\,$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} = \\frac{q^2 N_* (n_0' + p_0')}{\\epsilon' \\epsilon_* k_B T} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_* k_B T}{q^2 N_*} \\right)\n$$\nThe reference scales cancel out:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} = \\frac{n_0' + p_0'}{\\epsilon'}\n$$\nTherefore, the dimensionless screening length parameter $\\,\\lambda\\,$ is given by:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon'}{n_0' + p_0'}}\n$$\nFinally, we briefly discuss the interpretation of $\\,\\lambda\\,$. The physical screening length in the material is $\\,L_D = \\lambda L_* = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon'}{n_0' + p_0'}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_* k_B T}{q^2 N_*}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon' \\epsilon_* k_B T}{q^2 N_* (n_0' + p_0')}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon k_B T}{q^2 (n_0 + p_0)}}\\,$. So, the quantity $\\,L_* \\lambda\\,$ represents the physical Debye length $\\,L_D\\,$. The problem asks to compare a 2D channel thickness $\\,W\\,$ to this length.\n\nCase 1: $\\,W \\ll L_* \\lambda\\,$ (or $\\,W \\ll L_D\\,$). This is the ultra-thin body or \"long-range electrostatics\" regime. The channel is thinner than the natural screening length of the material. Electric fields, such as from a gate electrode, can penetrate through the entire thickness of the channel without being significantly screened by the mobile carriers. This provides strong electrostatic control by the gate over the entire channel volume, which is essential for suppressing short-channel effects in advanced transistors.\n\nCase 2: $\\,W \\gg L_* \\lambda\\,$ (or $\\,W \\gg L_D\\,$). This is the bulk or \"short-range electrostatics\" regime. The channel is much thicker than the screening length. An external electric field will be screened out by mobile carriers within a distance of approximately $\\,L_D\\,$ from the surface. The potential deep inside the channel ($\\,x \\gg L_D\\,$ from the interface) remains largely unperturbed. Gate control is confined to a thin surface layer, and the device behaves more like a bulk semiconductor, making it susceptible to poor gate control and short-channel effects.",

A solution will be derived and implemented.\n\n### Derivation of Physical Quantities\n\nThe derivation begins with the fundamental laws as specified. The one-dimensional Poisson's equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nThe electric field $E(x)$ is the negative gradient of the potential $\\phi(x)$:\n$$\nE(x) = -\\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx}\n$$\nCombining these, we obtain Gauss's law in differential form:\n$$\n\\frac{dE(x)}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nWithin the depletion region, $0 \\le x \\le W$, the space-charge density is constant, $\\rho(x) = qN_D$. Thus, for $0 \\le x \\le W$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE(x)}{dx} = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nTo find the electric field profile $E(x)$, we integrate this equation from an arbitrary point $x$ within the depletion region to the depletion edge $W$:\n$$\n\\int_{x}^{W} \\frac{dE(x')}{dx'} dx' = \\int_{x}^{W} \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon} dx'\n$$\n$$\nE(W) - E(x) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon} (W - x)\n$$\nApplying the boundary condition $E(W) = 0$:\n$$\n-E(x) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon} (W - x)\n$$\nThis gives the electric field profile within the depletion region:\n$$\nE(x) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon} (x - W) \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le W\n$$\nThe electric field is a linear function of $x$. It is negative, pointing from the positive space charge in the semiconductor towards the metal contact at $x=0$. The magnitude of the field, $|E(x)| = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon}(W-x)$, is greatest at the metal-semiconductor interface ($x=0$) and decreases linearly to zero at the depletion edge ($x=W$).\n\nThe maximum electric field, $E_{\\max}$, occurs at $x=0$:\n$$\nE_{\\max} = |E(0)| = \\left| \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon} (0 - W) \\right| = \\frac{qN_D W}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nTo find $W$, we use the second boundary condition, which relates the total potential drop across the depletion region, $V_{\\text{dep}}$, to the integral of the electric field. The potential drop is given as $V_{\\text{dep}} = V_{\\text{bi}} + V_R$.\n$$\nV_{\\text{dep}} = \\int_0^W |E(x)| dx = \\int_0^W \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon}(W-x) dx\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{dep}} = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon} \\left[ Wx - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_0^W = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon} \\left( W^2 - \\frac{W^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{qN_D W^2}{2\\varepsilon}\n$$\nSolving for the depletion width $W$:\n$$\nW = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon V_{\\text{dep}}}{qN_D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon(V_{\\text{bi}} + V_R)}{qN_D}}\n$$\nNow we can express $E_{\\max}$ in terms of the given parameters by substituting the expression for $W$:\n$$\nE_{\\max} = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon(V_{\\text{bi}} + V_R)}{qN_D}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon}\\right)^2 \\frac{2\\varepsilon(V_{\\text{bi}} + V_R)}{qN_D}}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2qN_D(V_{\\text{bi}} + V_R)}{\\varepsilon}}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the maximum electric field.\n\nFinally, we determine $L_{\\text{crit}}$, the spatial extent from the metal edge ($x=0$) over which the electric field magnitude exceeds a critical value $E_{\\text{crit}}$. This region is defined by the inequality $|E(x)| \\ge E_{\\text{crit}}$ for $x \\in [0, W]$.\n$$\n\\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon}(W - x) \\ge E_{\\text{crit}}\n$$\nThis inequality is only meaningful if $E_{\\max} \\ge E_{\\text{crit}}$. If $E_{\\max}  E_{\\text{crit}}$, the condition is never met, and $L_{\\text{crit}} = 0$. Assuming $E_{\\max} \\ge E_{\\text{crit}}$, we solve for $x$:\n$$\nW - x \\ge \\frac{\\varepsilon E_{\\text{crit}}}{qN_D} \\implies x \\le W - \\frac{\\varepsilon E_{\\text{crit}}}{qN_D}\n$$\nSince the region starts at $x=0$, the extent of this region is $L_{\\text{crit}} = W - \\frac{\\varepsilon E_{\\text{crit}}}{qN_D}$. A more convenient form for computation is derived by substituting $W = \\frac{\\varepsilon E_{\\max}}{qN_D}$:\n$$\nL_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon E_{\\max}}{qN_D} - \\frac{\\varepsilon E_{\\text{crit}}}{qN_D} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{qN_D}(E_{\\max} - E_{\\text{crit}})\n$$\nThis expression, combined with the condition that $L_{\\text{crit}}$ must be non-negative, gives the final formula:\n$$\nL_{\\text{crit}} = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{\\varepsilon}{qN_D}(E_{\\max} - E_{\\text{crit}})\\right)\n$$\n\n### Computational Strategy\nThe calculations will be performed in SI units.\n1.

This problem  demonstrates how to analyze these non-ideal effects by applying Gauss's law across a multi-layer structure, incorporating the semiconductor's own capacitive response. Solving for the change in surface potential reveals precisely how the location and sign of parasitic charges within the gate stack impact a transistor's threshold voltage, a crucial insight for device design and process control.",

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor (MOS) stack representative of advanced nanoelectronic gate stacks using a bilayer dielectric. The semiconductor is at $x=0$ and the gate metal is at $x=t_1+t_2$. The oxide stack comprises an interfacial dielectric with thickness $t_1$ and permittivity $\\varepsilon_1$, and a high-permittivity dielectric with thickness $t_2$ and permittivity $\\varepsilon_2$, arranged in series along the $x$-direction. A fixed, immobile sheet of charge with areal density $\\sigma_f$ (positive for net positive fixed charge, negative for net negative fixed charge) is embedded at position $x=x_f$ within the oxide, where $0x_ft_1+t_2$. The system is biased at a gate voltage $V_g$ such that, in the absence of the fixed charge ($\\sigma_f=0$), the semiconductor surface potential is $\\psi_s=\\psi_{s0}$, and the semiconductor responds around this operating point with a differential capacitance per unit area $C_s$ defined by $C_s=-\\mathrm{d}Q_s/\\mathrm{d}\\psi_s0$, where $Q_s$ is the net charge in the semiconductor space-charge region.\n\nStarting from Gauss’s law and the Poisson equation in one dimension, and imposing the appropriate electrostatic boundary conditions at the interfaces and across the embedded sheet charge, derive the exact small-signal change in the semiconductor surface potential, $\\Delta\\psi_s=\\psi_s-\\psi_{s0}$, caused by the introduction of the fixed sheet charge at depth $x_f$.

You may use the Heaviside step function $H(y)$, defined as $H(y)=1$ for $y0$ and $H(y)=0$ for $y0$, to compactly represent cases depending on whether the fixed charge resides in the interfacial dielectric ($0x_ft_1$) or in the high-permittivity dielectric ($t_1x_ft_1+t_2$).

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the small-signal change in the semiconductor surface potential, $\\Delta\\psi_s$, due to a fixed sheet of charge, $\\sigma_f$, embedded in a bilayer gate dielectric. The derivation will proceed from first principles using Gauss's law in one dimension.\n\nThe system is a one-dimensional MOS structure with the semiconductor at $x=0$ and the gate metal at $x=t_1+t_2$. The dielectric stack consists of two layers:\n1.  An interfacial layer with permittivity $\\varepsilon_1$ for $0  x  t_1$.\n2.  A high-permittivity layer with permittivity $\\varepsilon_2$ for $t_1  x  t_1+t_2$.\n\nThe governing electrostatic equation is Gauss's law in one dimension, which relates the spatial derivative of the displacement field, $D(x)$, to the free charge density, $\\rho(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}D(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\rho(x)\n$$\nIn this problem, the free charge within the oxide consists of an immobile sheet charge of areal density $\\sigma_f$ at position $x=x_f$.
