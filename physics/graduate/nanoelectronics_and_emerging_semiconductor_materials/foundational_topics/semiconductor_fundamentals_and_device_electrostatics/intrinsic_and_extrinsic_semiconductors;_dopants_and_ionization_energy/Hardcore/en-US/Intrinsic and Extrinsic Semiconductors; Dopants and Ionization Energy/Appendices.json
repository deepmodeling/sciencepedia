The system is in a non-equilibrium steady state, characterized by an electron quasi-Fermi level $E_{Fn}$. The charge exchange of the donor states is assumed to occur only with the electron reservoir.\n\nWe begin from the first principles of statistical mechanics using the grand canonical ensemble. A donor impurity site can exist in one of two states:\n1.  Ionized ($D^{+}$): The site is unoccupied. It has given up its electron. This state is non-degenerate; its degeneracy is $g_{\\mathrm{unocc}} = 1$.\n2.  Neutral ($D^{0}$): The site is occupied by an electron.

At low donor number density $n$, electrons are localized on donors with a binding energy set by the screened Coulomb interaction; as $n$ increases, screening and wavefunction overlap reduce the ionization energy and eventually produce an impurity band and a metal–insulator transition. Starting from first principles appropriate to this context, namely the effective-mass hydrogenic donor model and the physical requirement that impurity states must significantly overlap to form an extended network, derive an analytic expression for the critical donor density $n_{c}$ in terms of the effective Bohr radius $a_{B}^{*}$. Your derivation should justify the scaling with $a_{B}^{*}$ by combining (i) the spatial extent of the donor ground-state and (ii) the typical donor–donor separation at density $n$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the critical donor density $n_c$ for the formation of an impurity band, followed by a numerical calculation for a specific material. The physical basis for this transition is the Mott criterion, which postulates that a metallic state forms when the screening of the Coulomb potential is strong enough to delocalize the bound electrons. In the context of doped semiconductors, this is equivalent to the condition that the wavefunctions of electrons bound to adjacent donor atoms overlap significantly.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for $n_c$. The derivation combines two key length scales:\n1.  The average separation distance between donors, $d$. For a random distribution of donors with a number density $n$, the average volume occupied by a single donor is $1/n$. The characteristic separation distance is then related to the cube root of this volume. A common and simple scaling argument gives this distance as $d \\approx n^{-1/3}$.\n2.  The spatial extent of the electron's wavefunction bound to a single donor. Within the effective-mass hydrogenic model, the donor is treated as a hydrogen-like atom embedded in the semiconductor medium. The electron's ground-state wavefunction has a characteristic decay length given by the effective Bohr radius, $a_B^*$. This radius represents the spatial extent of the bound state.\n\nThe metal-insulator transition occurs at a critical density $n_c$ when the average donor separation $d$ becomes comparable to the spatial extent of the wavefunction. This condition allows for sufficient overlap of wavefunctions between neighboring sites, forming a continuous impurity band that permits electron conduction without thermal activation. This criterion is expressed by stating that the product of the wavefunction radius and the cube root of the critical density is a dimensionless constant. The problem provides this constant as $C$. Thus, the criterion is:\n$$n_{c}^{1/3} a_{B}^{*} = C$$\nThe problem specifies the value of this dimensionless overlap threshold constant as $C = 0.25$.\n\nTo find the analytic expression for $n_c$, we rearrange the equation above:\n$$n_{c}^{1/3} = \\frac{C}{a_{B}^{*}}$$\nCubing both sides gives the desired expression for the critical donor density:\n$$n_{c} = \\left(\\frac{C}{a_{B}^{*}}\\right)^{3}$$\nThis expression shows that the critical density scales inversely with the cube of the effective Bohr radius, $n_c \\propto (a_B^*)^{-3}$, as expected from the underlying physical argument.\n\nNext, we proceed with the numerical calculation for the specified material. We are given the following parameters:\n- Isotropic effective mass: $m^{*} = 0.26 \\, m_{e}$\n- Relative dielectric constant: $\\epsilon_{r} = 11.7$\n- Free-space Bohr radius: $a_{B} = 0.529 \\, \\text{\\AA}$\n\nThe effective Bohr radius $a_{B}^{*}$ is given by the formula:\n$$a_{B}^{*} = \\frac{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon_{r} \\hbar^{2}}{m^{*} e^{2}}$$\nThe free-space Bohr radius $a_{B}$ is:\n$$a_{B} = \\frac{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\hbar^{2}}{m_{e} e^{2}}$$\nBy taking the ratio of these two expressions, we can express $a_{B}^{*}$ in terms of $a_{B}$ and the material parameters:\n$$\\frac{a_{B}^{*}}{a_{B}} = \\frac{\\frac{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon_{r} \\hbar^{2}}{m^{*} e^{2}}}{\\frac{4\\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\hbar^{2}}{m_{e} e^{2}}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{r}}{m^{*}/m_{e}}$$\nTherefore, we can calculate $a_{B}^{*}$ as:\n$$a_{B}^{*} = a_{B} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{r}}{m^{*}/m_{e}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$a_{B}^{*} = (0.529 \\, \\text{\\AA}) \\left(\\frac{11.7}{0.26}\\right) = (0.529 \\, \\text{\\AA}) \\times 45 = 23.805 \\, \\text{\\AA}$$\nFor the calculation of density in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, we must convert $a_{B}^{*}$ into centimeters.
