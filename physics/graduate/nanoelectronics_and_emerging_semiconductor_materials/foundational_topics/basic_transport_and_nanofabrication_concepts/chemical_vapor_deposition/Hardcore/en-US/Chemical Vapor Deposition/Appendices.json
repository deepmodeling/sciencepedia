            "problem": "A low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process deposits a solid film from a dilute gaseous precursor species denoted by $A$. Consider a single, flat wafer over which a steady, one-dimensional boundary layer of gas of thickness $\\delta$ forms. The gas is isothermal, behaves ideally, and contains $A$ at a bulk concentration $C_{b}$ sufficiently small that $A$ can be treated as a dilute species in an otherwise inert carrier. The transport of $A$ across the boundary layer is by molecular diffusion with constant diffusivity $D$, and convection within the boundary layer can be neglected. At the wafer surface (taken as $y=0$), species $A$ incorporates into the solid via a first-order surface reaction with respect to the surface concentration, namely a surface reaction rate per area $r_{s}$ given by $r_{s} = k_{s} C_{s}$, where $C_{s}$ is the concentration of $A$ at the surface and $k_{s}$ is a kinetic coefficient. Let $y=\\delta$ denote the edge of the boundary layer, where the concentration of $A$ is $C_{b}$.\n\nStarting only from the steady one-dimensional species continuity in the gas film, Fick’s first law for a dilute species, and the boundary condition that the molar flux into the surface equals the surface consumption rate, derive a closed-form expression for the steady deposition flux $J$ onto the wafer in terms of $D$, $\\delta$, $k_{s}$, and $C_{b}$.

This can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{total}} = \\sigma_{\\text{int}} + \\sigma_{\\text{th}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the film is deposited at a constant temperature $T_{\\mathrm{dep}} = 800\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Immediately after deposition, at this temperature, there has been no temperature change, so the thermal expansion mismatch has not yet contributed to the stress. Therefore, the thermal stress component is zero, $\\sigma_{\\text{th}} = 0$. The stress present in the film at the deposition temperature is purely the intrinsic stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_f(T_{\\mathrm{dep}}) = \\sigma_{\\text{int}}\n$$\nTo determine this stress, we can use the measured wafer curvature, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{dep}}$. The relationship between the equi-biaxial stress in a thin film, $\\sigma_f$, and the curvature of the much thicker substrate, $\\kappa$, is given by the Stoney equation. As required, we derive this relation from first principles.\n\nA uniform biaxial stress $\\sigma_f$ in a film of thickness $t_f$ generates a force per unit width of $F_f = \\sigma_f t_f$. This force is exerted on the substrate, which must develop an opposing force to maintain mechanical equilibrium. This pair of forces, separated by a distance related to the film and substrate thicknesses, creates a bending moment $M$ that causes the wafer to curve. For a thin film where $t_f \\ll t_s$, the lever arm between the central plane of the film and the central plane of the substrate is approximately $t_s/2$. The bending moment per unit width is thus:\n$$\nM \\approx F_f \\left(\\frac{t_s}{2}\\right) = (\\sigma_f t_f) \\frac{t_s}{2}\n$$\nFrom the theory of plate bending under biaxial loading, the relationship between the applied bending moment $M$ and the resulting curvature $\\kappa$ for a plate (the substrate) is given by:\n$$\nM = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)} \\kappa\n$$\nHere, $E_s$, $\\nu_s$, and $t_s$ are the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and thickness of the substrate, respectively.\nEquating the two expressions for the moment $M$ yields:\n$$\n(\\sigma_f t_f) \\frac{t_s}{2} = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)} \\kappa\n$$\nSolving for the film stress $\\sigma_f$, we obtain the Stoney equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_f = \\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s} \\frac{t_s^2}{6 t_f} \\kappa\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s}$ is the biaxial modulus of the substrate, denoted as $M_s$.
