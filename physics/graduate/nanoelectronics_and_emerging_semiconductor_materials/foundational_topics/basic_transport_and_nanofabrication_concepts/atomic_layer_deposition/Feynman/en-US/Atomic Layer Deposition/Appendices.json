One reactive site.\n2.  A physical area of $a_m$, which becomes inaccessible to subsequent precursors.\n\nLet $\\Gamma_{\\text{occ}}$ be the areal density of occupied sites (and thus, of adsorbed precursor molecules) when the surface has reached saturation. The value of $\\Gamma_{\\text{occ}}$ is constrained by the total availability of both resources.\n\n**Constraint 1: Conservation of Sites**\nThe number of sites that become occupied cannot exceed the total number of sites that were initially available.\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\text{occ}} \\le \\Gamma_{\\text{sites}}\n$$\n\n**Constraint 2: Conservation of Area**\nThe total area excluded by all the adsorbed molecules cannot exceed the total available area. The total excluded area is the number of adsorbed molecules, $\\Gamma_{\\text{occ}}$, multiplied by the exclusion area per molecule, $a_m$.\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\text{occ}} \\cdot a_m \\le 1\n$$\nThis inequality can be rearranged to place a second constraint on $\\Gamma_{\\text{occ}}$:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\text{occ}} \\le \\frac{1}{a_m}\n$$\n\nThe process of adsorption continues until one of these two resources is fully depleted, which defines the saturation condition in this idealized model. Therefore, the reaction halts when $\\Gamma_{\\text{occ}}$ can increase no further without violating one of the two constraints. This means that at saturation, $\\Gamma_{\\text{occ}}$ will be the maximum possible value that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.

The dimensionless product $\\Gamma_{\\text{sites}} a_m$ represents the ratio of the area required per site ($a_m$) to the average area available per site ($1/\\Gamma_{\\text{sites}}$).\n-   If $\\Gamma_{\\text{sites}} a_m \\le 1$, the precursor molecules are sufficiently small that steric hindrance is not the limiting factor. All reactive sites can be occupied before the surface area is filled. In this case, $\\theta = 1$, corresponding to a complete monolayer of occupied sites.\n-   If $\\Gamma_{\\text{sites}} a_m > 1$, the precursor molecules are large. The surface becomes sterically saturated (jammed) before all reactive sites can be occupied. The growth is limited by area. In this case, $\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma_{\\text{sites}} a_m}  1$.\n\nThe derived expression is a single, closed-form function that correctly describes the behavior across both regimes based on the specified conservation principles.",

Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation begins with the species mass balance for precursor A in a well-mixed control volume, which is the reactor volume $V$.

In a well-mixed reactor, the mass concentration of precursor A, $\\rho_{A}$, is uniform and given by $\\rho_{A} = \\frac{m_{A}}{V}$. The pump removes gas at a volumetric rate $S$.

To find the governing relation for the partial pressure $P_{A}(t)$, we must relate $m_{A}$ to $P_{A}$ using the Ideal Gas Law:\n$$ P_{A}V = n_{A}RT $$\nwhere $n_{A}$ is the number of moles of precursor A, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the constant temperature.
