Unlike the parallel exposure of optical lithography, EBL is a serial process, which can be time-consuming. This exercise provides a practical framework for understanding the total time required to write a pattern by breaking it down into its constituent parts: the fundamental exposure time and the various system overheads that significantly impact overall efficiency . Mastering this calculation is the first step toward optimizing writing strategies and managing fabrication schedules.",

            "problem": "An electron-beam lithography system is used to create a pattern on a substrate coated with a positive resist. The system operates with a constant electron beam current, $I$, and employs a vector scan writing strategy. The pattern consists of a large rectangular base structure with dimensions $L_x \\times L_y$, which requires an area dose of $D_{base}$ to be fully cleared upon development. Superimposed on this base are $N$ identical, non-overlapping small square features, each with side length $s$. These small features require an additional area dose of $D_{detail}$ to ensure their high-resolution definition. Thus, the total area dose delivered to the regions of the small squares is $D_{base} + D_{detail}$.\n\nThe writing process is constrained by the system's architecture. The electron beam can only be deflected over a maximum square area of $W \\times W$, known as a writing field. To pattern the entire $L_x \\times L_y$ area, the substrate is mounted on a movable stage. We assume for simplicity that $L_x$ and $L_y$ are integer multiples of $W$. The stage moves in a serpentine fashion to position each writing field under the electron column. Each movement of the stage from one field to the next incurs a fixed overhead time of $t_{stage}$.\n\nWithin each writing field, the system first exposes the base rectangle area and then writes the small square features that fall within that field. A beam settling overhead time, $t_{settle}$, is required for the electromagnetic lenses to stabilize the beam before the exposure of each of the $N$ small squares begins. This overhead is not incurred for the continuous exposure of the large base area.\n\nAssuming the $N$ small squares are distributed uniformly across the entire $L_x \\times L_y$ pattern, calculate the total time, $T_{total}$, required to complete the lithography for this entire pattern. Express your answer in terms of the given parameters: $L_x, L_y, N, s, D_{base}, D_{detail}, I, W, t_{stage}, t_{settle}$.",
            "solution": "The total time $T_{total}$ comprises the exposure time for the base structure, the exposure and settling time for the small squares, and the stage movement overhead. The exposure times depend on the dose, area, and beam current, while the settling and stage times are fixed overheads.\n\nThe base structure has area $L_x L_y$ and requires an area dose $D_{base}$. The charge delivered to the base is $D_{base} L_x L_y$. With constant beam current $I$, the exposure time for the base is:\n\n$$\nt_{\\text{base}} = \\frac{D_{base} L_x L_y}{I}\n$$\n\n\nEach of the $N$ small squares has area $s^2$ and requires an additional area dose $D_{detail}$, so the additional charge per small square is $D_{detail} s^2$. The exposure time per small square is:\n\n$$\nt_{\\text{square}} = \\frac{D_{detail} s^2}{I}\n$$\n\nAdditionally, each small square incurs a beam settling time $t_{settle}$ before exposure.

Round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\nThe problem concerns a one-dimensional grating pattern. Therefore, it is appropriate to model the line-spread function (LSF), which is the effective one-dimensional point-spread function, as a normalized Gaussian function of a single spatial variable, say $x$. The LSF, which we will denote as $PSF(x)$, is given by:\n$$PSF(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}\\right)$$\nThe Modulation Transfer Function, $MTF(k)$, is defined as the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the $PSF(x)$. The Fourier transform, $\\widehat{PSF}(k)$, is given by:\n$$\\widehat{PSF}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} PSF(x) e^{-ikx} dx$$\nwhere $k$ is the spatial angular frequency. For a normalized Gaussian function, the Fourier transform is also a Gaussian function:\n$$\\widehat{PSF}(k) = \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}\\right)\\right\\}(k) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}{2}\\right)$$\nThe MTF is the magnitude of this result. Since the expression is real and positive for all real $k$, the MTF is equal to the Fourier transform itself:\n$$MTF(k) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}{2}\\right)$$\nThe problem relates the spatial angular frequency $k$ to the half-pitch $p$ of the sinusoidal grating. The spatial frequency is $f = 1/(2p)$, and the angular frequency is $k = 2\\pi f$. Substituting the expression for $f$, we find the relationship between $k$ and $p$:\n$$k = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{2p}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{p}$$\nWe can now express the MTF as a function of the half-pitch $p$ by substituting this expression for $k$ into the MTF equation:\n$$MTF(p) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\pi/p)^2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}{2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}{2p^2}\\right)$$\nThe resolution criterion states that the minimum resolvable half-pitch, $p_{\\min}$, is achieved when the contrast, or MTF, equals $0.5$. We set $MTF(p_{\\min}) = 0.5$:\n$$0.5 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}{2p_{\\min}^2}\\right)$$\nTo solve for $p_{\\min}$, we first take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\ln(0.5) = -\\frac{\\pi^2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}{2p_{\\min}^2}$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(0.5) = \\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2)$, we have:\n$$-\\ln(2) = -\\frac{\\pi^2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}{2p_{\\min}^2}$$\nThe negative signs cancel out:\n$$\\ln(2) = \\frac{\\pi^2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}{2p_{\\min}^2}$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $p_{\\min}^2$:\n$$p_{\\min}^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}{2\\ln(2)}$$\nFinally, taking the square root of both sides gives the expression for the minimum resolvable half-pitch. As pitch must be a positive quantity, we take the positive root:\n$$p_{\\min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi^2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}{2\\ln(2)}} = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}}$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for $p_{\\min}$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$p_{\\min} = \\frac{\\pi \\times (5.0\\,\\mathrm{nm})}{\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}}$$\nWe calculate the values of the constants: $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$ and $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69315$.\n$$p_{\\min} \\approx \\frac{3.14159 \\times 5.0}{\\sqrt{2 \\times 0.69315}} = \\frac{15.70795}{\\sqrt{1.3863}} \\approx \\frac{15.70795}{1.17741}$$\n$$p_{\\min} \\approx 13.341755\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe first four significant figures are $1$, $3$, $3$, and $4$.
