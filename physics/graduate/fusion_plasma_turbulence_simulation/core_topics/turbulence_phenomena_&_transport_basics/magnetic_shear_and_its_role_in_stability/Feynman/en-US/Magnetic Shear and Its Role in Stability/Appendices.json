Second, the safety factor $q(r)$ is calculated from its definition. Third, the normalized magnetic shear $\\hat{s}(r)$ is found by differentiating $q(r)$. Finally, a physical explanation of the relationship between the current profile and the magnetic shear is provided.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Poloidal Magnetic Field $B_{\\theta}(r)$**\n\nWe use Ampère's law in integral form, $\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{enc}$, for an amperian loop of a circle of radius $r$ in the poloidal plane. Due to axisymmetry, $B_{\\theta}$ is constant on this loop.\n$$ B_{\\theta}(r) (2\\pi r) = \\mu_0 I_{enc}(r) $$\nThe enclosed toroidal current $I_{enc}(r)$ is the integral of the current density $j_{\\phi}(r')$ over the circular area of radius $r$.\n$$ I_{enc}(r) = \\int_0^r j_{\\phi}(r') (2\\pi r') dr' $$\nSubstituting the given profile $j_{\\phi}(r') = j_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{r'^2}{a^2}\\right)$:\n$$ I_{enc}(r) = 2\\pi j_0 \\int_0^r \\left(r' - \\frac{r'^3}{a^2}\\right) dr' $$\n$$ I_{enc}(r) = 2\\pi j_0 \\left[ \\frac{r'^2}{2} - \\frac{r'^4}{4a^2} \\right]_0^r = 2\\pi j_0 \\left( \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4a^2} \\right) = \\pi j_0 r^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right) $$\nNow, we solve for $B_{\\theta}(r)$:\n$$ B_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_{enc}(r)}{2\\pi r} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi r} \\left[ \\pi j_0 r^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ B_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{\\mu_0 j_0 r}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right) $$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Safety Factor $q(r)$**\n\nThe safety factor $q$ is the number of toroidal transits a magnetic field line makes for one poloidal transit. For a large-aspect-ratio, circular-cross-section tokamak, it is defined as:\n$$ q(r) = \\frac{r B_{\\phi}}{R_0 B_{\\theta}} $$\nUsing the approximations $B_{\\phi} \\approx B_0$ and $R \\approx R_0$, and substituting our expression for $B_{\\theta}(r)$:\n$$ q(r) = \\frac{r B_0}{R_0 \\left[ \\frac{\\mu_0 j_0 r}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right) \\right]} $$\nSimplifying, the factor of $r$ in the numerator and denominator cancels:\n$$ q(r) = \\frac{2 B_0}{R_0 \\mu_0 j_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right)} $$\nThis is the expression for the safety factor. We can note the on-axis value is $q_0 = q(0) = \\frac{2 B_0}{R_0 \\mu_0 j_0}$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Normalized Magnetic Shear $\\hat{s}(r)$**\n\nThe normalized magnetic shear is defined as $\\hat{s}(r) = \\frac{r}{q(r)} \\frac{dq}{dr}$. We first compute the derivative $\\frac{dq}{dr}$:\n$$ q(r) = \\frac{q_0}{1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2}} = q_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right)^{-1} $$\nUsing the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{dq}{dr} = q_0 (-1) \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right)^{-2} \\left( -\\frac{2r}{2a^2} \\right) = q_0 \\frac{r}{a^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right)^{-2} $$\nNow we construct $\\hat{s}(r)$:\n$$ \\hat{s}(r) = \\frac{r}{q(r)} \\frac{dq}{dr} = \\frac{r}{\\frac{q_0}{1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2}}} \\left[ q_0 \\frac{r}{a^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right)^{-2} \\right] $$\n$$ \\hat{s}(r) = r \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2}\\right) \\frac{r}{a^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2}\\right)^{-2} = \\frac{r^2}{a^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2}\\right)^{-1} $$\n$$ \\hat{s}(r) = \\frac{\\frac{r^2}{a^2}}{1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2}} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $2a^2$ gives the final simplified form:\n$$ \\hat{s}(r) = \\frac{2r^2}{2a^2 - r^2} $$\n\n**4. Qualitative Explanation of the Relationship Between $j_{\\phi}(r)$ and $\\frac{dq}{dr}$**\n\nThe shape of the safety factor profile, characterized by its gradient $\\frac{dq}{dr}$, is fundamentally determined by the radial distribution of the toroidal current density, $j_{\\phi}(r)$. To see this, we can relate $\\frac{dq}{dr}$ to $j_{\\phi}(r)$ and the average current density inside radius $r$, $\\langle j_{\\phi} \\rangle_r = \\frac{I_{enc}(r)}{\\pi r^2}$. From the differential form of Ampère's law, $\\mu_0 j_{\\phi} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}(rB_{\\theta})$. The derivative of $q(r)$ is $\\frac{dq}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}(\\frac{rB_0}{R_0 B_{\\theta}}) \\approx \\frac{B_0}{R_0 B_{\\theta}} (1 - \\frac{r}{B_{\\theta}}\\frac{dB_{\\theta}}{dr})$. Substituting $\\frac{dB_{\\theta}}{dr} = \\mu_0 j_{\\phi} - \\frac{B_{\\theta}}{r}$ and $B_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\mu_0 r \\langle j_{\\phi} \\rangle_r}{2}$ leads to the general relation:\n$$ \\frac{dq}{dr} \\propto \\frac{1}{r} \\left( 1 - \\frac{j_{\\phi}(r)}{\\langle j_{\\phi} \\rangle_r} \\right) $$\nThis relation (up to a positive proportionality constant) shows that the sign of the slope of the $q$-profile is determined by the ratio of the local current density to the average current density enclosed.\n- If $j_{\\phi}(r)  \\langle j_{\\phi} \\rangle_r$, then $\\frac{dq}{dr} > 0$. This corresponds to a \"normal\" or positive magnetic shear, where $q(r)$ increases with radius. This typically occurs for centrally peaked current profiles.\n- If $j_{\\phi}(r) > \\langle j_{\\phi} \\rangle_r$, then $\\frac{dq}{dr}  0$. This corresponds to a \"reversed\" or negative magnetic shear, where $q(r)$ decreases with radius. This occurs in regions where the current is peaked off-axis (a \"hollow\" current profile).\n\nFor the given parabolic profile, $j_{\\phi}(r) = j_0 (1 - \\frac{r^2}{a^2})$, the current density is maximum at the center ($r=0$) and decreases to zero at the edge ($r=a$). The average current density is $\\langle j_{\\phi} \\rangle_r = \\frac{I_{enc}(r)}{\\pi r^2} = j_0 (1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2})$. For any $r \\in (0, a]$, we have $\\frac{r^2}{a^2} > \\frac{r^2}{2a^2}$, which implies $(1-\\frac{r^2}{a^2})  (1-\\frac{r^2}{2a^2})$. Therefore, $j_{\\phi}(r)  \\langle j_{\\phi} \\rangle_r$ for all $r>0$. This means that for this profile, $\\frac{dq}{dr} > 0$ everywhere except at the axis, and $q(r)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $r$.\n\n- **Near-axis trend ($r \\to 0$)**: As $r \\to 0$, $j_{\\phi}(r)$ and $\\langle j_{\\phi} \\rangle_r$ both approach $j_0$. From our derived expression, $\\frac{dq}{dr} = q_0 \\frac{r}{a^2} (1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2})^{-2}$, it is clear that $\\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{dq}{dr} = 0$. The $q$-profile is flat at the magnetic axis. This is a general feature for any current profile that is smooth and non-zero at the axis.\n\n- **Edge trend ($r \\to a$)**: At the plasma edge, $j_{\\phi}(a) = 0$ while $\\langle j_{\\phi} \\rangle_a = j_0(1 - \\frac{a^2}{2a^2}) = \\frac{j_0}{2}$. The local current density is much lower than the average, leading to a strong positive gradient in $q$. Evaluating the derivative at $r=a$:\n$\\frac{dq}{dr}|_{r=a} = q_0 \\frac{a}{a^2} (1 - \\frac{a^2}{2a^2})^{-2} = \\frac{q_0}{a} (\\frac{1}{2})^{-2} = \\frac{4q_0}{a}$. The slope is finite and positive, indicating that $q(r)$ continues to increase steeply towards the plasma boundary.\n\nIn summary, the centrally-peaked parabolic current profile produces a monotonically increasing safety factor profile ($q'(r) > 0$) that is flat at the center and becomes progressively steeper towards the edge.",

            "problem": "Consider a large-aspect-ratio, circular-cross-section tokamak with normalized minor radius $r \\in [0,1]$. The safety factor is a smooth function of radius given by $q(r) = q_0 + a r + b r^2$, where $q_0 > 0$, and $a$ and $b$ are real constants chosen such that $q(r) > 0$ for all $r \\in [0,1]$. In the large-aspect-ratio limit, the magnetic shear $\\hat{s}(r)$ is the dimensionless measure of the radial variation of field-line pitch constructed from the safety factor and the minor radius.

            "solution": "The problem asks for three items: first, to derive the expression for the magnetic shear $\\hat{s}(r)$ in a large-aspect-ratio, circular-cross-section tokamak; second, to compute this expression for a given parabolic safety factor profile $q(r)$; and third, to find the radial location $r_{\\min}$ where this shear is minimized.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of the magnetic shear expression. The safety factor, $q(r)$, represents the number of toroidal turns a magnetic field line makes for each poloidal turn on a given magnetic flux surface of minor radius $r$. It geometrically characterizes the pitch of the helical magnetic field lines. The magnetic shear, $\\hat{s}(r)$, is a dimensionless quantity that measures the radial variation of this pitch. A non-zero shear means that field lines on adjacent flux surfaces have different pitches, causing them to \"shear\" relative to one another.\n\nThe radial variation of the safety factor is given by its derivative, $\\frac{dq}{dr}$. To create a measure of the relative change, we consider the logarithmic derivative, $\\frac{1}{q(r)}\\frac{dq(r)}{dr} = \\frac{d(\\ln q(r))}{dr}$. This quantity has units of inverse length. To make it dimensionless, we must normalize it by a characteristic length scale. The natural local length scale for radial variations is the minor radius $r$ itself. Thus, the standard dimensionless magnetic shear $\\hat{s}(r)$ is constructed as:\n$$\n\\hat{s}(r) = r \\left( \\frac{1}{q(r)} \\frac{dq(r)}{dr} \\right) = \\frac{r}{q(r)} \\frac{dq(r)}{dr}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the closed-form expression for $\\hat{s}(r)$ using the given safety factor profile, $q(r) = q_0 + a r + b r^2$.\nThe first step is to calculate the radial derivative of $q(r)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} (q_0 + a r + b r^2) = a + 2br\n$$\nNow, we substitute $q(r)$ and its derivative into the expression for $\\hat{s}(r)$:\n$$\n\\hat{s}(r) = \\frac{r (a + 2br)}{q_0 + ar + br^2} = \\frac{ar + 2br^2}{q_0 + ar + br^2}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the magnetic shear for the given $q$-profile.\n\nFinally, we determine the radial location $r_{\\min} \\in (0,1)$ where the magnetic shear $\\hat{s}(r)$ is minimized. To find the extrema of $\\hat{s}(r)$, we must compute its derivative with respect to $r$ and set it to zero. Let $u(r) = ar + 2br^2$ and $v(r) = q_0 + ar + br^2$. Using the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{s}}{dr} = \\frac{\\frac{d}{dr}(ar + 2br^2) (q_0 + ar + br^2) - (ar + 2br^2) \\frac{d}{dr}(q_0 + ar + br^2)}{(q_0 + ar + br^2)^2}\n$$\nThe derivatives of $u(r)$ and $v(r)$ are $u'(r) = a + 4br$ and $v'(r) = a + 2br$. Substituting these into the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{s}}{dr} = \\frac{(a + 4br)(q_0 + ar + br^2) - (ar + 2br^2)(a + 2br)}{(q_0 + ar + br^2)^2}\n$$\nFor an extremum, we set the numerator to zero:\n$$\n(a + 4br)(q_0 + ar + br^2) - (ar + 2br^2)(a + 2br) = 0\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\n(aq_0 + a^2r + abr^2 + 4bq_0r + 4abr^2 + 4b^2r^3) - (a^2r + 2abr^2 + 2abr^2 + 4b^2r^3) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(aq_0 + (a^2 + 4bq_0)r + 5abr^2 + 4b^2r^3) - (a^2r + 4abr^2 + 4b^2r^3) = 0\n$$\nSimplifying the expression by combining like terms:\n$$\naq_0 + (a^2 + 4bq_0 - a^2)r + (5ab - 4ab)r^2 + (4b^2 - 4b^2)r^3 = 0\n$$\n$$\naq_0 + 4bq_0r + abr^2 = 0\n$$\nThis gives a quadratic equation for the radial location $r$ of the extrema:\n$$\nabr^2 + 4bq_0r + aq_0 = 0\n$$\nWe solve for $r$ using the quadratic formula, $r = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$, with $A = ab$, $B = 4bq_0$, and $C = aq_0$.\n$$\nr = \\frac{-4bq_0 \\pm \\sqrt{(4bq_0)^2 - 4(ab)(aq_0)}}{2ab} = \\frac{-4bq_0 \\pm \\sqrt{16b^2q_0^2 - 4a^2bq_0}}{2ab}\n$$\nWe can factor $4bq_0$ out of the square root's argument:\n$$\nr = \\frac{-4bq_0 \\pm \\sqrt{4bq_0(4bq_0 - a^2)}}{2ab} = \\frac{-4bq_0 \\pm 2\\sqrt{bq_0(4bq_0 - a^2)}}{2ab}\n$$\n$$\nr = \\frac{-2bq_0 \\pm \\sqrt{bq_0(4bq_0 - a^2)}}{ab}\n$$\nThe problem provides the constraints $a  0$, $b > 0$, and $4q_0b > a^2$. The constraint $4q_0b > a^2$ ensures the discriminant is positive (since $b>0, q_0>0$), so two distinct real roots exist. Since $a0$ and $b>0$, the denominator $ab$ is negative. Also, since $b>0$ and $q_0>0$, the term $-2bq_0$ is negative. Both roots must be positive, as the product of the roots is $\\frac{C}{A} = \\frac{aq_0}{ab} = \\frac{q_0}{b} > 0$ and the sum of the roots is $\\frac{-B}{A} = \\frac{-4bq_0}{ab} = \\frac{-4q_0}{a} > 0$.\n\nTo determine which root corresponds to the minimum, we analyze the behavior of $\\hat{s}(r)$. We are given $a0$ and $b>0$, so for small positive $r$, the numerator $ar+2br^2 \\approx ar  0$. The denominator $q_0+ar+br^2 \\approx q_0 > 0$. Thus, $\\hat{s}(r)$ is negative shortly after $r=0$. Since $\\hat{s}(0)=0$ and $\\hat{s}(r)$ must eventually become positive (for large enough $r$, $\\hat{s}(r) \\approx \\frac{2br^2}{br^2}=2$), the function must have a global minimum at a positive value of $r$. The first extremum encountered starting from $r=0$ must be this minimum.\nThe two roots are $r_1 = \\frac{-2bq_0 + \\sqrt{...}}{ab}$ and $r_2 = \\frac{-2bq_0 - \\sqrt{...}}{ab}$.\nLet's rewrite this as $r = \\frac{2bq_0 \\mp \\sqrt{...}}{-ab}$. Since $-ab > 0$, the smaller root corresponds to the minus sign in the numerator.\nTherefore, the location of the minimum is:\n$$\nr_{\\min} = \\frac{-2bq_0 + \\sqrt{bq_0(4bq_0 - a^2)}}{ab}\n$$\nThis is the smaller of the two positive roots and corresponds to the location of the minimum magnetic shear.",

Let the perpendicular structure of the mode be described by an eikonal phase $\\exp\\left(i S\\right)$ with $S(x,y,\\theta) = k_y y + k_x(\\theta) x$, where $k_y$ is taken to be constant along the field line while $k_x(\\theta)$ is allowed to vary due to magnetic shear.

            "solution": "The solution proceeds in three parts. First, we derive the dependence of the radial wavenumber, $k_x$, on the extended poloidal angle, $\\theta$, due to magnetic shear. Second, we explain the physical consequence of this dependence on Finite Larmor Radius (FLR) effects. Finally, we compute the requested numerical value.\n\nIn a tokamak, the magnetic field lines on different flux surfaces have different pitches, a property quantified by the magnetic shear parameter $\\hat{s} = \\frac{r}{q} \\frac{dq}{dr}$, where $r$ is the minor radius and $q$ is the safety factor. This geometric property has a profound impact on the structure of plasma instabilities. In the flux-tube formalism using field-aligned coordinates $(x, y, \\theta)$, where $x$ is the radial coordinate, $y$ is the binormal coordinate, and $\\theta$ is the extended poloidal angle along the magnetic field line, the wavevector of a perturbation is not constant.\n\nA mode is typically centered on a rational flux surface where its wavevector is purely perpendicular to the magnetic field, meaning its parallel wavenumber $k_\\parallel$ is zero. As the mode extends along the magnetic field line (variation in $\\theta$), it also probes neighboring flux surfaces (variation in $x$). Due to shear, the magnetic field direction changes with a radial displacement, which couples the radial position $x$ to the parallel structure.\n\nIn the eikonal representation of the mode, $\\exp(i S)$ with $S(x,y,\\theta) = k_y y + k_x(\\theta) x$, the binormal wavenumber $k_y$ is constant along the field line, but the radial wavenumber $k_x$ is not. The standard model for linear magnetic shear establishes a direct relationship between the radial wavenumber $k_x$ and the position along the field line $\\theta$. This relationship can be derived from the geometry of sheared magnetic fields and is given by:\n$$k_x(\\theta) = k_x(0) - \\hat{s} k_y \\theta$$\nwhere the sign convention is consistent with common usage in gyrokinetic theory. The problem specifies that the mode is centered such that its radial wavenumber is zero at $\\theta=0$, i.e., $k_x(0) = 0$. Applying this condition simplifies the expression to:\n$$k_x(\\theta) = - \\hat{s} k_y \\theta$$\nThis equation shows that the radial wavenumber component of the mode is generated dynamically by the magnetic shear as one moves away from the point of symmetry at $\\theta=0$.\n\nWith this result, we can determine the evolution of the perpendicular wavenumber magnitude, $k_{\\perp}(\\theta)$. The perpendicular wavenumber squared is defined as $k_{\\perp}^2(\\theta) = k_x^2(\\theta) + k_y^2$. Substituting our expression for $k_x(\\theta)$:\n$$k_{\\perp}^2(\\theta) = (- \\hat{s} k_y \\theta)^2 + k_y^2 = (\\hat{s} k_y \\theta)^2 + k_y^2$$\nFactoring out $k_y^2$, we obtain:\n$$k_{\\perp}^2(\\theta) = k_y^2 \\left( 1 + (\\hat{s} \\theta)^2 \\right)$$\nThis expression shows that $k_{\\perp}^2$ has its minimum value of $k_y^2$ at $\\theta=0$ and increases quadratically with $|\\theta|$. The physical implication of this variation is connected to Finite Larmor Radius (FLR) effects.\n\nFLR effects arise because ions are not point particles but have a finite gyroradius, $\\rho_i$. Ions average the electric field of a wave over their gyro-orbit. This gyroaveraging process reduces the effective field felt by the ion guiding center, which generally has a stabilizing or damping effect on instabilities. The strength of this effect is determined by the parameter $k_{\\perp} \\rho_i$. The gyroaveraging factor, often represented by the zeroth-order Bessel function $J_0(k_{\\perp} \\rho_i)$ or related functions like $\\Gamma_0(k_{\\perp}^2 \\rho_i^2/2) = I_0(k_{\\perp}^2 \\rho_i^2/2) \\exp(-k_{\\perp}^2 \\rho_i^2/2)$, is a decreasing function of its argument.\n\nAs established, magnetic shear causes $k_{\\perp}$ to increase with $|\\theta|$. Consequently, the parameter $k_{\\perp}(\\theta) \\rho_i = \\sqrt{k_x^2(\\theta) + k_y^2} \\rho_i = (k_y \\rho_i) \\sqrt{1 + (\\hat{s} \\theta)^2}$ also increases with $|\\theta|$. This means that far from the mode center (large $|\\theta|$), FLR effects become very strong, leading to significant damping of the mode. This shear-induced damping is a crucial mechanism that limits the parallel extent of drift-wave instabilities, effectively localizing them to a finite region around $\\theta=0$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the maximum absolute value of $|k_x \\rho_i|$ over the interval $\\theta \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$ for the given parameters. The quantity of interest is:\n$$|k_x(\\theta) \\rho_i| = |(- \\hat{s} k_y \\theta) \\rho_i| = |\\hat{s} (k_y \\rho_i) \\theta|$$\nWe are given the dimensionless parameters $\\hat{s} = 0.8$ and $k_y \\rho_i = 0.3$. Substituting these values:\n$$|k_x(\\theta) \\rho_i| = |0.8 \\times 0.3 \\times \\theta| = |0.24 \\theta|$$\nThe function $|0.24 \\theta|$ is a monotonically increasing function of $|\\theta|$. Therefore, its maximum value on the interval $\\theta \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$ will occur at the endpoints, where $|\\theta|$ is largest, i.e., at $\\theta = \\pi$ or $\\theta = -\\pi$. At these points, $|\\theta| = \\pi$.\n\nThe maximum value is:\n$$|k_x \\rho_i|_{\\text{max}} = 0.24 \\times \\pi$$\nTo provide an exact analytical expression, we convert the decimal numbers to fractions:\n$$\\hat{s} = 0.8 = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\n$$k_y \\rho_i = 0.3 = \\frac{3}{10}$$\nThe maximum value is then calculated as:\n$$|k_x \\rho_i|_{\\text{max}} = |\\hat{s}| \\cdot |k_y \\rho_i| \\cdot |\\theta|_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{10} \\times \\pi = \\frac{12}{50} \\pi = \\frac{6}{25} \\pi$$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{6}{25}\\pi}$$"
