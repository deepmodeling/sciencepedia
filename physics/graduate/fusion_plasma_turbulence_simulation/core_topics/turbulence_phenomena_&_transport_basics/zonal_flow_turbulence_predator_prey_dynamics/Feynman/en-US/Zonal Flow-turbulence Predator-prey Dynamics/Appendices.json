This process becomes effective when the zonal flow's shearing rate, characterized by the radial gradient of the $\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}$ velocity, becomes comparable to the linear growth rate of the underlying turbulence. This exercise provides a tangible link between theoretical models and physical scales by asking you to calculate the critical zonal flow amplitude required for suppression under typical tokamak core conditions. Completing this practice  will help you develop a quantitative intuition for this crucial self-regulation mechanism.",

We can therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires a determination of the critical zonal flow amplitude, denoted $V_E^{\\mathrm{crit}}$, for which the zonal shear rate balances the linear drift-wave growth rate.

Differentiating with respect to time $t$ gives:\n$$\n\\sec^{2}(\\theta) \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\frac{x \\frac{dy}{dt} - y \\frac{dx}{dt}}{x^{2}}\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sec^{2}(\\theta) = 1 + \\tan^{2}(\\theta) = 1 + (y/x)^{2} = (x^{2} + y^{2})/x^{2} = r^{2}/x^{2}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{r^{2}}{x^{2}}\\right) \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\frac{x \\frac{dy}{dt} - y \\frac{dx}{dt}}{x^{2}}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $x^{2}$ (for $x \\neq 0$) yields:\n$$\nr^{2} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = x \\frac{dy}{dt} - y \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\nNow, substitute the expressions for $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt}$:\n$$\nr^{2} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = x \\left[ \\beta x + (\\nu P - \\alpha) y - \\mu (x^{2} + y^{2}) y \\right] - y \\left[ (\\nu P - \\alpha) x - \\beta y - \\mu (x^{2} + y^{2}) x \\right]\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\nr^{2} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\beta x^{2} + (\\nu P - \\alpha) xy - \\mu (x^{2} + y^{2}) xy - (\\nu P - \\alpha) xy + \\beta y^{2} + \\mu (x^{2} + y^{2}) xy\n$$\nThe terms involving $(\\nu P - \\alpha)xy$ cancel, and the terms involving $\\mu(x^{2} + y^{2})xy$ also cancel. We are left with:\n$$\nr^{2} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\beta x^{2} + \\beta y^{2} = \\beta (x^{2} + y^{2})\n$$\nSubstituting $r^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2}$:\n$$\nr^{2} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\beta r^{2}\n$$\nFor $r  0$, we can divide by $r^{2}$ to find the equation for the phase evolution:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\beta\n$$\n\nThe system in polar coordinates is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{dt} = r \\left( (\\nu P - \\alpha) - \\mu r^{2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\beta\n$$\nA limit cycle is a periodic solution in the $(x, y)$ phase space, which corresponds to a constant, non-zero amplitude $r(t) = R$ and a constantly rotating phase $\\theta(t)$ in polar coordinates. The condition for a constant amplitude $R  0$ is $\\frac{dr}{dt} = 0$.\nSetting $\\frac{dr}{dt} = 0$ in the amplitude equation gives:\n$$\nR \\left( (\\nu P - \\alpha) - \\mu R^{2} \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince we are looking for a non-trivial limit cycle, we require $R  0$. Therefore, the term in the parenthesis must be zero:\n$$\n(\\nu P - \\alpha) - \\mu R^{2} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $R^{2}$:\n$$\n\\mu R^{2} = \\nu P - \\alpha \\implies R^{2} = \\frac{\\nu P - \\alpha}{\\mu}\n$$\nThe amplitude $R$ is the positive square root:\n$$\nR = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu P - \\alpha}{\\mu}}\n$$\nThis solution is physically meaningful (real and positive) only if $\\nu P - \\alpha  0$, which is precisely the condition stated in the problem for the existence of the limit cycle.\n\nThe period of the oscillation, $T$, is determined by the angular frequency $\\omega$. From the phase equation, we have the angular frequency:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\beta\n$$\nThe period $T$ is related to the angular frequency $\\omega$ by the formula $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$. Substituting $\\omega = \\beta$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta}\n$$\nThus, the period of the limit cycle is $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta}$ and its amplitude is $R = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu P - \\alpha}{\\mu}}$.",
