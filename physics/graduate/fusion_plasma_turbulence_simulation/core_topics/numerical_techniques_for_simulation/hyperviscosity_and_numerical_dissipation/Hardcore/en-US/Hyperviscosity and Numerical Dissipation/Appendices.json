The use of hyperviscosity (specifically a bi-Laplacian operator for $n=2$) is a standard technique in turbulence simulations to provide scale-selective dissipation at the grid scale. The Forward Euler method is a fundamental explicit time-stepping scheme. The stability analysis of this scheme applied to a linear dissipative operator is a classic, well-understood problem.

The logic is self-contained and leads to a unique solution.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise and quantitative, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard numerical stability analysis exercise that is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe evolution of a single Fourier mode amplitude, $\\hat{\\phi}_k(t)$, under the influence of the hyperviscosity operator is described by the linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{\\phi}_k}{dt} = \\lambda_k \\hat{\\phi}_k\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_k$ is the eigenvalue corresponding to the wavenumber $k$. For the given hyperviscosity term of order $n=2$, the eigenvalue is:\n$$\n\\lambda_k = -\\nu_2 k^4\n$$\n\nThe problem states that this ODE is discretized in time using an explicit Forward Euler scheme. Let $\\hat{\\phi}_k^j$ denote the value of the Fourier amplitude at time step $j$. The Forward Euler update is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{\\phi}_k^{j+1} - \\hat{\\phi}_k^j}{\\Delta t} = \\lambda_k \\hat{\\phi}_k^j\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta t$ is the time step. Rearranging this equation gives the update rule for $\\hat{\\phi}_k$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\phi}_k^{j+1} = \\hat{\\phi}_k^j + \\Delta t (\\lambda_k \\hat{\\phi}_k^j) = (1 + \\lambda_k \\Delta t) \\hat{\\phi}_k^j\n$$\nThe term $G_k = 1 + \\lambda_k \\Delta t$ is the amplification factor for the mode $k$. For the numerical scheme to be stable, the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed unity for any mode. This prevents the unbounded growth of any component of the numerical solution. The stability condition is therefore:\n$$\n|G_k| \\le 1 \\quad \\forall k\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $G_k$, we have:\n$$\n|1 + \\lambda_k \\Delta t| \\le 1\n$$\nThe eigenvalue $\\lambda_k = -\\nu_2 k^4$ is a real, non-positive number, since the hyperviscosity coefficient $\\nu_2 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{m}^4/\\mathrm{s}$ is positive. The stability condition for a real, non-positive eigenvalue $\\lambda$ in a Forward Euler scheme is a well-known result. We can derive it by considering the inequality $|1 + \\lambda \\Delta t| \\le 1$. Since $\\lambda \\Delta t \\le 0$, we have:\n$$\n-1 \\le 1 + \\lambda_k \\Delta t \\le 1\n$$\nThe right side of the inequality, $1 + \\lambda_k \\Delta t \\le 1$, simplifies to $\\lambda_k \\Delta t \\le 0$, which is always satisfied given that $\\lambda_k \\le 0$ and $\\Delta t \\ge 0$. The left side of the inequality provides the non-trivial constraint:\n$$\n-1 \\le 1 + \\lambda_k \\Delta t\n$$\n$$\n-2 \\le \\lambda_k \\Delta t\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{-2}{\\lambda_k} = \\frac{2}{-\\lambda_k} = \\frac{2}{|\\lambda_k|}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda_k$:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{2}{\\nu_2 k^4}\n$$\nThis condition must hold for all wavenumbers $k$ resolved on the numerical grid. To ensure global stability, the time step $\\Delta t$ must be chosen to satisfy the most restrictive case. The right-hand side of the inequality is minimized when the denominator, $\\nu_2 k^4$, is maximized. This occurs at the highest representable wavenumber, $k_{\\max}$. Therefore, the maximum stable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{\\nu_2 k_{\\max}^4}\n$$\nThe problem provides the grid spacing $\\Delta x = \\pi/5000 \\, \\mathrm{m}$ and defines the maximum wavenumber as the Nyquist wavenumber, $k_{\\max} = \\pi/\\Delta x$.\n$$\nk_{\\max} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\pi/5000 \\, \\mathrm{m}} = 5000 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nNow we can substitute the numerical values for $\\nu_2$ and $k_{\\max}$ into the expression for $\\Delta t_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\nu_2 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^4}{\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\max} = 5 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^4}{\\mathrm{s}}) (5 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1})^4}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-11}) (5^4 \\times (10^3)^4)} \\, \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-11}) (625 \\times 10^{12})} \\, \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{2.0 \\times 625 \\times 10^{(-11+12)}} \\, \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{1250 \\times 10^1} \\, \\mathrm{s} = \\frac{2}{12500} \\, \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{6250} \\, \\mathrm{s} = 0.00016 \\, \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in microseconds ($\\mu\\mathrm{s}$).\n$$\n1 \\, \\mathrm{s} = 10^6 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = 0.00016 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{s} = 160 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nFinally, we must round the answer to four significant figures.
