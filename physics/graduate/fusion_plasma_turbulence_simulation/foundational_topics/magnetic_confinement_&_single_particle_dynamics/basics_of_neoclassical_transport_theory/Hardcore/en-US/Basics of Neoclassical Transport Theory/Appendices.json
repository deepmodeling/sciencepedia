            "problem": "Consider singly charged deuterium ions with mass $m_i$ and charge $q = Z e$ (with $Z = 1$ and $e$ the elementary charge) moving in a tokamak with circular magnetic field lines of major radius $R$. Assume a static, uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$ and a purely radial electric field of magnitude $E_r$. Let the ions have an isotropic Maxwellian distribution characterized by temperature $T_i$, so that the thermal perpendicular speed satisfies $v_{\\perp}^{2} \\sim 2 k_B T_i / m_i$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The ion gyrofrequency is $\\Omega_i = q B / m_i$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and comparison of two fundamental guiding-center drift velocities for ions in a tokamak plasma: the magnetic drift ($v_d$) due to the toroidal geometry and the electric drift ($v_E$) due to a radial electric field.\n\nFirst, let us derive the magnetic drift velocity, which arises from the spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field in a toroidal configuration. In a simple toroidal geometry with major radius $R$, the magnetic field strength $B$ varies approximately as $B \\propto 1/R'$, where $R'$ is the major radial coordinate. This leads to a magnetic field gradient, $\\nabla B$. Additionally, the magnetic field lines are curved with a radius of curvature approximately equal to the major radius $R$. These two effects, the gradient of $B$ and the curvature of the field lines, both cause charged particles to drift.\n\nThe grad-B drift is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} = \\frac{W_{\\perp}}{q B^2} (\\mathbf{B} \\times \\nabla B) $$\nwhere $q = Z e$ is the ion charge, $W_{\\perp} = \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_{\\perp}^2$ is the perpendicular kinetic energy, and $v_\\perp$ is the ion velocity component perpendicular to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$.\n\nThe curvature drift is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_{R} = \\frac{2 W_{\\parallel}}{q B^2} (\\mathbf{B} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\kappa}) $$\nwhere $W_{\\parallel} = \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_{\\parallel}^2$ is the parallel kinetic energy and $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$ is the curvature vector of the magnetic field line.\n\nIn a simple large-aspect-ratio tokamak, both the magnetic field gradient and the curvature vector point towards the axis of the torus (in the major radial direction). Their magnitudes can be approximated as $|\\nabla B|/B \\sim |\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}| \\sim 1/R$. The directions of $\\mathbf{B} \\times \\nabla B$ and $\\mathbf{B} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$ are the same (typically vertical). Thus, the magnitudes of the two drifts add up. The total magnetic drift velocity magnitude, denoted $v_d$, is the sum of the magnitudes of these two drifts:\n$$ v_d = | \\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} | + | \\mathbf{v}_{R} | \\approx \\frac{W_{\\perp}}{q B R} + \\frac{2 W_{\\parallel}}{q B R} = \\frac{1}{q B R} (W_{\\perp} + 2 W_{\\parallel}) $$\nSubstituting the kinetic energy expressions gives:\n$$ v_d \\approx \\frac{1}{q B R} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_{\\perp}^2 + m_i v_{\\parallel}^2 \\right) $$\nThe problem specifies an isotropic Maxwellian distribution for the ions. For a 3D isotropic distribution, the average energies are related by $\\langle v_{\\parallel}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle v_{\\perp}^2 \\rangle$. The problem provides the scaling for the characteristic perpendicular velocity squared as $v_{\\perp}^2 \\sim 2 k_B T_i / m_i$. This is consistent with the thermal average $\\langle v_{\\perp}^2 \\rangle = 2 k_B T_i / m_i$. Consequently, the average parallel velocity squared is $\\langle v_{\\parallel}^2 \\rangle = k_B T_i / m_i$. We use these thermal characteristic speeds to estimate the drift magnitude:\n$$ v_d \\approx \\frac{m_i}{q B R} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2 k_B T_i}{m_i} \\right) + \\frac{k_B T_i}{m_i} \\right) = \\frac{m_i}{q B R} \\left( \\frac{k_B T_i}{m_i} + \\frac{k_B T_i}{m_i} \\right) = \\frac{2 k_B T_i}{q B R} $$\nWith $q = Z e$, the expression is:\n$$ v_d = \\frac{2 k_B T_i}{Z e B R} $$\nThe problem also asks for a scaling of $v_d$ in terms of $v_{\\perp}$, the ion gyrofrequency $\\Omega_i = q B / m_i$, and $R$. Using the relation $v_d \\approx \\frac{m_i}{qBR} (v_{\\parallel}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}v_{\\perp}^2) \\approx \\frac{m_i}{qBR} v_{\\perp}^2$ for an isotropic distribution ($v_{\\parallel}^2 \\sim v_{\\perp}^2/2$), and substituting $qB = m_i \\Omega_i$, we obtain:\n$$ v_d \\approx \\frac{m_i}{ (m_i \\Omega_i) R} v_{\\perp}^2 = \\frac{v_{\\perp}^2}{\\Omega_i R} $$\nThis achieves the required scaling.\n\nNext, we consider the $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ drift. The drift velocity is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_E = \\frac{\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}}{B^2} $$\nThe problem states a radial electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ (perpendicular to the toroidal magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$). The magnitude of this drift is therefore:\n$$ v_E = \\frac{|\\mathbf{E}| |\\mathbf{B}| \\sin(90^{\\circ})}{B^2} = \\frac{E_r}{B} $$\nwhere $E_r$ is the magnitude of the radial electric field.\n\nNow we can compute the ratio $v_d / v_E$:\n$$ \\frac{v_d}{v_E} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2 k_B T_i}{Z e B R} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{E_r}{B} \\right)} $$\nThe magnetic field magnitude $B$ cancels, yielding a compact expression in terms of the requested parameters:\n$$ \\frac{v_d}{v_E} = \\frac{2 k_B T_i}{Z e E_r R} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of this ratio using the provided parameters:\n- $T_i = 2.5\\,\\text{keV}$\n- $Z = 1$\n- $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}$\n- $E_r = 2.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{V/m}$\n- $R = 1.7\\,\\text{m}$\n\nIn plasma physics, it is common to express temperature in units of electron-volts (eV), which represents an energy. The term $k_B T_i$ represents the thermal energy. Given $T_i = 2.5\\,\\text{keV}$, this directly implies that the thermal energy is $k_B T_i = 2.5\\,\\text{keV}$.\n$$ k_B T_i = 2.5 \\times 10^3 \\,\\text{eV} $$\nLet's evaluate the term in the denominator, $Z e E_r R$, which also has units of energy. The product $E_r R$ gives a potential difference in volts.\n$$ E_r R = (2.0 \\times 10^4 \\,\\text{V/m}) \\times (1.7\\,\\text{m}) = 3.4 \\times 10^4 \\,\\text{V} $$\nThe energy $e(E_r R)$ is the potential energy of a charge $e$ over this potential difference.

In a tokamak, the magnetic field strength is approximately toroidal and varies with the major radius $R$ as $B \\propto 1/R$. This spatial variation gives rise to a drift velocity, $\\vec{v}_D$. This drift is predominantly in the vertical direction in the poloidal cross-section.
