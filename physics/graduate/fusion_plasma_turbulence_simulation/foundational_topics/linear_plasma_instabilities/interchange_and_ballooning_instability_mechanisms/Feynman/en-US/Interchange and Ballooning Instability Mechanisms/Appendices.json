            "introduction": "Before delving into the complex theory of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities, it is crucial to connect the abstract parameters of stability analysis to measurable, physical quantities. The normalized pressure-gradient parameter, $\\alpha$, is a cornerstone of the $s$-$\\alpha$ model, quantifying the drive for ballooning instabilities that arises from plasma pressure in regions of unfavorable magnetic curvature. This exercise  will ground your understanding by guiding you through the calculation of $\\alpha$ from fundamental tokamak parameters, providing a tangible sense of the forces at play and a first look at assessing plasma stability.",

            "problem": "Consider a large-aspect-ratio, circular-flux-surface tokamak equilibrium in which the toroidal magnetic field is approximately radially constant over the region of interest. You are analyzing ideal Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) ballooning stability using the standard shear–alpha ($s$–$\\alpha$) framework in which the normalized pressure-gradient parameter $\\alpha$ encapsulates the interchange drive due to unfavorable curvature. The plasma has magnetic shear $s=0.8$, safety factor $q=2.5$, major radius $R_0=3$ m, toroidal magnetic field magnitude $B=3$ T, and radial pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dr}=-5\\times 10^{4}$ Pa/m. Assume the vacuum permeability is $\\mu_0=4\\pi\\times 10^{-7}$ N/A$^2$ and neglect any radial variation of $B$ in evaluating derivatives of the plasma beta.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions and well-tested relations appropriate to ideal MHD and the $s$–$\\alpha$ model, derive an expression for the normalized pressure-gradient parameter $\\alpha$ in terms of $\\mu_0$, $R_0$, $q$, $B$, and $\\frac{dp}{dr}$, then compute its value for the given parameters. Express $\\alpha$ as a dimensionless quantity and provide the final result as an exact analytical expression (no rounding).\n\nFinally, based on the computed $\\alpha$ and the given magnetic shear $s$, qualitatively assess whether the plasma is likely above the first ballooning stability boundary in the $s$–$\\alpha$ stability diagram for positive shear, explaining your reasoning. Your qualitative assessment must appear only in your derivation; the final answer must contain only your exact value of $\\alpha$ and no words.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. All provided parameters and the underlying theoretical framework, the $s$–$\\alpha$ model for ideal Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) ballooning stability, are standard in the field of fusion plasma physics. The provided numerical values are physically realistic for a tokamak. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary task is to derive and compute the value of the normalized pressure-gradient parameter, $\\alpha$. This parameter is a central component of the $s$–$\\alpha$ model for ballooning instabilities in tokamaks. It quantifies the instability drive arising from the plasma pressure gradient in a region of unfavorable magnetic field curvature.\n\nThe standard definition of $\\alpha$ is formulated in terms of the radial derivative of the plasma beta, $\\beta$. The plasma beta is the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure:\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{p}{p_{mag}} = \\frac{p}{B^2 / (2\\mu_0)} = \\frac{2\\mu_0 p}{B^2} $$\nwhere $p$ is the plasma pressure, $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field, and $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability.\n\nThe drive for ballooning modes is proportional to the pressure gradient. In the $s$–$\\alpha$ formalism, this is expressed through the radial derivative of beta, denoted as $\\beta'$.\n$$ \\beta' = \\frac{d\\beta}{dr} $$\nwhere $r$ is the minor radial coordinate. Using the definition of $\\beta$ and applying the product rule for differentiation gives:\n$$ \\beta' = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{2\\mu_0 p}{B^2} \\right) = \\frac{2\\mu_0}{B^2} \\frac{dp}{dr} - \\frac{4\\mu_0 p}{B^3} \\frac{dB}{dr} $$\nThe problem statement specifies that we should neglect any radial variation of the magnetic field $B$ when evaluating derivatives of beta. This simplifies the expression for $\\beta'$ considerably by setting $\\frac{dB}{dr}=0$:\n$$ \\beta' = \\frac{2\\mu_0}{B^2} \\frac{dp}{dr} $$\nThe normalized pressure-gradient parameter $\\alpha$ is defined in the large-aspect-ratio, circular flux surface limit as:\n$$ \\alpha = -R_0 q^2 \\beta' $$\nHere, $R_0$ is the major radius of the tokamak and $q$ is the safety factor. The minus sign is conventional; since a confined plasma has a negative pressure gradient ($\\frac{dp}{dr}  0$), the value of $\\alpha$ is positive, representing the magnitude of the instability drive.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\beta'$ into the definition of $\\alpha$, we obtain the desired expression for $\\alpha$ in terms of the fundamental given parameters:\n$$ \\alpha = -R_0 q^2 \\left( \\frac{2\\mu_0}{B^2} \\frac{dp}{dr} \\right) = - \\frac{2 \\mu_0 R_0 q^2}{B^2} \\frac{dp}{dr} $$\nThis expression is dimensionless, as is required for a normalized parameter.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $\\alpha$ using the provided data:\n- Magnetic shear, $s = 0.8$\n- Safety factor, $q = 2.5$\n- Major radius, $R_0 = 3$ m\n- Toroidal magnetic field magnitude, $B = 3$ T\n- Radial pressure gradient, $\\frac{dp}{dr} = -5 \\times 10^{4}$ Pa/m\n- Vacuum permeability, $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}$ N/A$^2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = - \\frac{2 (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (3) (2.5)^2}{(3)^2} (-5 \\times 10^4) $$\nThe two negative signs cancel. Let's simplify the expression:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{2 \\cdot (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\cdot 3 \\cdot (6.25)}{9} \\cdot (5 \\times 10^4) $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{2 \\cdot 4\\pi \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6.25 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 10^{-7} \\cdot 10^4}{9} $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{8\\pi \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6.25 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 10^{-3}}{9} $$\nThe factor of $3$ in the numerator cancels with one factor of $3$ in the denominator:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{8\\pi \\cdot 6.25 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 10^{-3}}{3} $$\nNext, we evaluate the product $8 \\times 6.25 \\times 5$:\n$$ 8 \\times 6.25 = 8 \\times \\frac{25}{4} = 2 \\times 25 = 50 $$\n$$ 50 \\times 5 = 250 $$\nSo the expression becomes:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{250\\pi \\times 10^{-3}}{3} = \\frac{0.25\\pi}{3} $$\nTo write this as a simple fraction:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\pi/4}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{12} $$\nThis is the exact analytical value for the normalized pressure-gradient parameter $\\alpha$.\n\nFinally, we perform a qualitative assessment of the ballooning stability. The $s$–$\\alpha$ stability diagram maps out regions of stability and instability for ideal ballooning modes as a function of the magnetic shear $s$ and the pressure-gradient parameter $\\alpha$. For positive shear ($s > 0$), there is a first region of stability for low values of $\\alpha$, an unstable region for intermediate $\\alpha$, and potentially a second region of stability for very large $\\alpha$. The boundary between the first stable region and the unstable region, known as the first stability boundary, is a curve $\\alpha_c(s)$ that starts at the origin $(s=0, \\alpha=0)$ and increases with $s$. A common rule of thumb for this boundary at moderate shear ($s \\approx 0.5 - 1.5$) is that instability occurs when $\\alpha$ is on the order of $s$. A more precise analytical approximation is $\\alpha_c(s) \\approx 0.6s$ for $s \\lesssim 1.5$.\nThe given parameters are $s = 0.8$ and the computed value is $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\approx \\frac{3.14159}{12} \\approx 0.262$.\nLet's compare our computed $\\alpha$ with the approximate stability boundary at $s=0.8$:\n$$ \\alpha_c(s=0.8) \\approx 0.6 \\times 0.8 = 0.48 $$\nSince our computed value $\\alpha \\approx 0.262$ is substantially less than the estimated critical value $\\alpha_c \\approx 0.48$, the plasma operating point $(s, \\alpha) = (0.8, \\pi/12)$ lies well within the first region of stability. The destabilizing drive from the pressure gradient is insufficient to overcome the stabilizing effect of field-line bending, which is quantified by the magnetic shear. Therefore, the plasma is qualitatively assessed to be stable with respect to ideal MHD ballooning modes.",

The absolute error is computed as $|\\lambda_0^{(N)} - \\lambda_0|$.\nFor the special case where $K=1$, the off-diagonal terms vanish, making $L$ a diagonal matrix. The basis functions $\\varphi_n$ are the exact eigenfunctions of $\\mathcal{L}$, and the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries $L_{nn}$. In this case, the numerical result is exact, and the error will be zero up to machine precision. This is tested in case 5. For other cases, convergence is expected, meaning the error will decrease as the basis size $N$ increases.",
