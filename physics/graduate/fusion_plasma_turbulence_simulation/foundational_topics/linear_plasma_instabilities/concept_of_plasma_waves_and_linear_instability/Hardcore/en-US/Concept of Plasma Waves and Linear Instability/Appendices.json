The core physical idea is that the tearing mode can only grow if its characteristic coherent structure is maintained. The shear flow acts to destroy this coherence.\n\nIn the absence of shear flow ($S=0$), the tearing mode has a growth rate $\\gamma_0$ and the instability is localized to a resistive inner layer of half-width $\\delta$ around the resonant surface $x=0$.\n\nWith shear flow ($S \\neq 0$), the perturbation at different radial positions $x$ is advected in the $y$-direction at different speeds, $v_y(x) = S x$. This differential advection leads to a \"phase mixing\" or \"shearing\" of the mode structure. The rate of this process can be estimated by considering the variation of the Doppler-shifted frequency across the radial width of the mode.\n\nThe local frequency of the wave as seen by the plasma is $\\omega(x) = \\omega_{lab} - k_y v_y(x) = \\omega_{lab} - k_y S x$. For a growing mode, we consider the temporal evolution dominated by the growth rate $\\gamma$. The key term from the linearized equations is the operator $(\\gamma - i k_y S x)$. The term $i k_y S x$ represents an imaginary frequency, or a position-dependent phase velocity that shears the mode.\n\nThe characteristic dephasing rate, $\\gamma_{shear}$, is the rate at which the phase coherence of the mode is lost across its radial extent. We estimate this as the magnitude of the difference in the Doppler shift across the resistive layer width $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{shear} = |\\omega_D(\\delta) - \\omega_D(0)| = |(k_y S \\delta) - (k_y S \\cdot 0)| = |k_y S \\delta|\n$$\nThis rate represents how quickly the shear flow tears apart the coherent eddy or island structure of the tearing mode.\n\nStabilization occurs when the dephasing (shearing) process is faster than the mode's intrinsic growth. If the mode structure is torn apart before it has time to amplify, the instability is suppressed. The critical condition for stabilization is met when the shearing rate becomes comparable to the unsheared growth rate $\\gamma_0$. We define the critical shear rate, $S_c$, as the value of $|S|$ for which these two rates are equal:\n$$\n\\gamma_{shear} = \\gamma_0\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for the shearing rate:\n$$\n|k_y S_c \\delta| = \\gamma_0\n$$\nSolving for $S_c$ (which is conventionally taken as a positive quantity representing the magnitude of the shear rate):\n$$\nS_c = \\frac{\\gamma_0}{k_y \\delta}\n$$\nThis criterion signifies that if the shear rate $S$ exceeds $S_c$, the tearing mode is stabilized because the convective dephasing across the resistive layer occurs on a timescale shorter than the mode's growth timescale.",

The problem states that the collisionless TEM instability is suppressed when the detrapping rate is greater than or comparable to the bounce frequency. This condition is expressed as:\n$$ \\nu_{d} \\gtrsim \\omega_{be} $$\nPhysically, this means that collisions are frequent enough to scatter an electron from its trapped trajectory before it can complete a bounce, thus destroying the wave-particle resonance driving the mode.\n\nThe critical collision frequency, $\\nu_{ei,\\mathrm{crit}}$, is defined at the threshold of this condition, where the two rates are of the same order of magnitude:\n$$ \\nu_{d} \\approx \\omega_{be} \\quad \\text{when} \\quad \\nu_{ei} = \\nu_{ei,\\mathrm{crit}} $$\nWe use the expressions for $\\nu_{d}$ and $\\omega_{be}$ to establish the relationship. From part (a), the detrapping rate at the critical collision frequency is:\n$$ \\nu_{d} \\sim \\frac{\\nu_{ei,\\mathrm{crit}}}{\\epsilon} $$\nThe bounce frequency is given as:\n$$ \\omega_{be} \\sim \\frac{\\sqrt{\\epsilon} \\, v_{te}}{qR} $$\nEquating the two expressions at the critical point yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu_{ei,\\mathrm{crit}}}{\\epsilon} \\sim \\frac{\\sqrt{\\epsilon} \\, v_{te}}{qR} $$\nTo find $\\nu_{ei,\\mathrm{crit}}$, we solve for it by multiplying both sides by $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\nu_{ei,\\mathrm{crit}} \\sim \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{\\epsilon} \\, v_{te}}{qR} \\right) $$\nCombining the powers of $\\epsilon$ ($\\epsilon^{1} \\cdot \\epsilon^{1/2} = \\epsilon^{3/2}$), we obtain the final scaling:\n$$ \\nu_{ei,\\mathrm{crit}} \\sim \\frac{\\epsilon^{3/2} v_{te}}{qR} $$\nSince the problem asks for a closed-form symbolic expression and the derivation is based on scaling relations (denoted by `\\sim`), it is standard practice in such estimations to treat the relation as an equality, assuming a proportionality constant of order unity. Therefore, the expression for the critical collision frequency is:\n$$ \\nu_{ei,\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{\\epsilon^{3/2} v_{te}}{qR} $$",
