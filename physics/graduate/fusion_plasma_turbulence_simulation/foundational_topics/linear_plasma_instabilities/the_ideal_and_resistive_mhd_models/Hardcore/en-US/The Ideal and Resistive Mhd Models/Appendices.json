The governing equations are the standard, simplified resistive MHD equations. The initial condition, $\\mathbf{B}(x, t=0) = B_0 \\sin(k x)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, is divergence-free, as required by $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$, since $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = \\partial_z (B_0 \\sin(k x)) = 0$. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary equations, initial conditions, and simplifying assumptions provided. The setup is consistent and leads to a well-posed initial value problem for a partial differential equation. All terms are clearly defined and objective. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary task is to derive the equation governing the time evolution of the magnetic field, $\\mathbf{B}$, and then solve it for the given initial condition.\n\nFirst, we derive the magnetic induction equation. We start with the Maxwell-Faraday law:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nNext, we substitute for the electric field, $\\mathbf{E}$, using Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{E} = \\eta \\mathbf{J} - \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\times (\\eta \\mathbf{J} - \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla \\times (\\eta \\mathbf{J})\n$$\nThe current density, $\\mathbf{J}$, is related to the magnetic field via Ampère's law (in the magnetostatic approximation), $\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla \\times \\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the definition of magnetic diffusivity, $\\eta_m \\equiv \\eta / \\mu_0$, we obtain the general magnetic induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla \\times (\\eta_m \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe problem specifies a static fluid, $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}$, which eliminates the first term on the right-hand side. The resistivity $\\eta$, and thus the diffusivity $\\eta_m$, is a uniform constant scalar. Therefore, $\\eta_m$ can be moved outside the curl operator:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\eta_m \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nWe use the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{A}$. Applying this to $\\mathbf{B}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\eta_m(\\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nFrom Maxwell's equations (or as a standalone law of magnetostatics), the magnetic field is always divergence-free, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. This simplifies the equation to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\eta_m \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis is the magnetic diffusion equation, which governs the evolution of the magnetic field in a static, uniformly resistive medium.\n\nNow, we solve this equation for the given initial condition $\\mathbf{B}(x, t=0) = B_0 \\sin(k x)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The magnetic field has only a $z$-component, $\\mathbf{B} = B_z(x, t) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, and it depends only on the spatial coordinate $x$ and time $t$. The Laplacian operator simplifies accordingly:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\right) (B_z(x, t) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\frac{\\partial^2 B_z}{\\partial x^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nsince derivatives with respect to $y$ and $z$ are zero. The vector PDE reduces to a scalar PDE for the component $B_z$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial t} = \\eta_m \\frac{\\partial^2 B_z}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis is the one-dimensional diffusion (or heat) equation. We seek a solution of the form $B_z(x, t) = A(t) F(x)$ that satisfies the initial condition $B_z(x, 0) = B_0 \\sin(k x)$. This suggests a spatial dependence of $F(x) = \\sin(k x)$. Let's assume a solution of the form:\n$$\nB_z(x, t) = A(t) \\sin(k x)\n$$\nSubstituting this ansatz into the PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} [A(t) \\sin(k x)] = \\eta_m \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} [A(t) \\sin(k x)]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} \\sin(k x) = \\eta_m A(t) \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}[\\sin(k x)]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} \\sin(k x) = \\eta_m A(t) [-k^2 \\sin(k x)]\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we can divide by $\\sin(k x)$, which yields an ordinary differential equation for the time-dependent amplitude $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = - \\eta_m k^2 A(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE with the general solution:\n$$\nA(t) = C \\exp(-\\eta_m k^2 t)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. We determine $C$ from the initial condition at $t=0$:\n$$\nB_z(x, 0) = A(0) \\sin(k x) = B_0 \\sin(k x)\n$$\nThis implies that $A(0) = B_0$. From our solution for $A(t)$, we have $A(0) = C \\exp(0) = C$. Thus, $C=B_0$. The time-dependent amplitude is:\n$$\nA(t) = B_0 \\exp(-\\eta_m k^2 t)\n$$\nThe complete solution for the magnetic field evolution is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}(x, t) = B_0 \\exp(-\\eta_m k^2 t) \\sin(k x) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the decay rate $\\gamma$ such that the magnetic field amplitude decays as $\\exp(-\\gamma t)$. From our solution, the amplitude of the magnetic field, which is the prefactor to the spatial part, is $B_0 \\exp(-\\eta_m k^2 t)$. By comparing this with the form $B_0 \\exp(-\\gamma t)$, we can directly identify the decay rate $\\gamma$.\n$$\n\\exp(-\\gamma t) = \\exp(-\\eta_m k^2 t)\n$$\nTherefore, the decay rate is:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\eta_m k^2\n$$\nThe units of magnetic diffusivity $\\eta_m$ are $\\mathrm{m}^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and the units of wavenumber $k$ are $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. The units of $\\gamma$ are therefore $(\\mathrm{m}^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{m}^{-1})^2 = \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as requested.",

The Lundquist number is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the ratio of the resistive magnetic diffusion time, $\\tau_R$, to the Alfvén crossing time, $\\tau_A$. It is defined as:\n$$S = \\frac{\\tau_R}{\\tau_A}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the Alfvén crossing time, $\\tau_A$. This is the time it takes for an Alfvén wave to travel across the characteristic length scale of the system, $L$. The formula is:\n$$\\tau_A = \\frac{L}{v_A}$$\nwhere $v_A$ is the Alfvén speed.

This is the characteristic time scale on which magnetic fields diffuse through a resistive plasma over the length scale $L$. It is given by:\n$$\\tau_R = \\frac{\\mu_0 L^2}{\\eta}$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the plasma's electrical resistivity. The problem specifies the use of the classical Spitzer resistivity for a fully ionized plasma with effective charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1$.

The classical steady-state model of reconnection (Sweet-Parker model) predicts a very slow reconnection rate for such high $S$ values. However, the condition $S > S_c$ indicates that the thin current sheet, which is central to the reconnection process, is unstable to a tearing-type instability. This instability breaks the monolithic current sheet into a chain of smaller magnetic islands, or \"plasmoids\". The formation, growth, and violent ejection of these plasmoids disrupt the simple Sweet-Parker layer, leading to a reconnection process that is much faster, bursty, and chaotic. This \"plasmoid-unstable\" regime is believed to be the dominant mode of fast reconnection in many high-$S$ systems, including tokamak plasmas and solar flares. Therefore, for the given tokamak-relevant parameters, one should expect a fast, plasmoid-mediated reconnection regime rather than slow, steady Sweet-Parker reconnection.",

Let us use the standard Maxwell stress tensor (magnetic part): $\\mathbf{T}_{B, \\text{std}} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\left(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{B} - \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{B}^2\\mathbf{I}\\right)$, for which the force density is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{T}_{B, \\text{std}}$.\nThe divergence is:\n$$ (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{T}_{B, \\text{std}})_j = \\partial_i \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\left(B_i B_j - \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{ij}B^2\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\left[ (\\partial_i B_i)B_j + B_i(\\partial_i B_j) - \\frac{1}{2}\\partial_j(B_k B_k) \\right] $$\nIn vector form, this is:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{T}_{B, \\text{std}} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\left[ (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})\\mathbf{B} + (\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{B} - \\nabla\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{B}^2}{2}\\right) \\right] $$\nBy comparing this with the expression for the Lorentz force $\\mathbf{F}_L$, we find the crucial relationship:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{T}_{B, \\text{std}} = \\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})\\mathbf{B} $$\nThis shows that the conservative form of the force, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{T}_{B, \\text{std}}$, is identical to the physical Lorentz force, $\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}$, if and only if $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. If $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\ne 0$, using the conservative form in the momentum equation introduces a spurious, unphysical force density $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{err}} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})\\mathbf{B}$. This term is often called a \"magnetic monopole\" force, as $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$ would represent the density of magnetic monopoles.\n\n(Note: The tensor in the problem, $\\mathbf{T}_B = - \\mathbf{T}_{B, \\text{std}}$. This corresponds to a convention where the force is $-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{T}_B$, leading to the same physical conclusion.)\n\n**2. Analysis of the Energy Equation**\n\nThe total energy of the MHD system is the sum of kinetic, internal, and magnetic energy. The consistency of the model requires that work and energy exchange terms cancel perfectly. The rate of work done by the magnetic field on the fluid is $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_{mag}$, which should be balanced by a loss of energy from the electromagnetic field.\n\nFrom Poynting's theorem and Ohm's law, the sink term in the magnetic energy equation is $\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{J}$. Using $\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B} + \\eta\\mathbf{J}$, we get:\n$$ \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = (-\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\mathbf{J} + \\eta J^2 = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}) + \\eta J^2 $$\nThe term $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B})$ represents the rate of work done by the Lorentz force, transferring energy from the field to the fluid's kinetic motion. The term $\\eta J^2$ is the irreversible Ohmic heating, transferring energy to the fluid's internal energy.\n\nThus, the energy transfer rate from the magnetic field to the fluid's kinetic energy is precisely $-\\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B})$.\nIn an energy-conserving scheme, the source term in the fluid kinetic energy equation must be the opposite of this. The source term for kinetic energy is the work done by the force used in the momentum equation, $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_{mag}$.\n\nIf the momentum equation uses the conservative form $\\mathbf{F}_{mag} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{T}_{B, \\text{std}}$, the work rate is:\n$$ \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_{mag} = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})\\mathbf{B}\\right) = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{B})(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) $$\nWhen we sum the magnetc and kinetic energy equations to check for total energy conservation, the exchange terms should cancel. The net rate of spurious energy generation, $\\dot{E}_{\\text{err}}$, is:\n$$ \\dot{E}_{\\text{err}} = (\\text{source for KE}) - (\\text{sink from B-field}) = \\left[\\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{B})(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})\\right] - \\left[\\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B})\\right] $$\n$$ \\dot{E}_{\\text{err}} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{B})(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) $$\nThis is a spurious source/sink of energy that corrupts the total energy conservation of the system. This failure of consistency occurs whenever $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\ne 0$ and is independent of whether the MHD is ideal ($\\eta=0$) or resistive ($\\eta > 0$).\n\n### **Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Enforcing $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$ is required by Gauss’s law for magnetism and ensures that the conservative magnetic force written as $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{T}_B$ is identical to $\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}$. If $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\ne 0$, the pressure–tension form produces an additional term $\\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\mathbf{B}(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})$ in the momentum equation that acts as an unphysical “magnetic monopole” force. In the energy balance, this yields a spurious source $\\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{u})(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})$ that breaks the exact exchange $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B})$ with magnetic energy, corrupting conservation in both ideal and resistive MHD.**\n\n    This option correctly states that $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$ is a physical law. It correctly identifies the condition under which the conservative force form matches the Lorentz force. While slightly imprecise in attributing the extra term to the \"pressure-tension form\" itself rather than its inconsistent use with a non-solenoidal field in a conservative formulation, the physics is correct: an unphysical force term $\\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})\\mathbf{B}$ appears. It correctly identifies the resulting spurious energy source term $\\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{B})(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})$ and that this corrupts energy conservation in both ideal and resistive MHD. All key physical and mathematical consequences are correctly described.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$ is only needed for the induction equation to avoid numerical oscillations; the momentum and energy equations are unaffected because $\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ depends only on $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$ and therefore does not involve $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$.**\n\n    This is incorrect. While maintaining $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$ is important for numerical stability (avoiding oscillations), it is fundamentally required for the consistency of the momentum and energy equations, as derived above. The statement that these equations are \"unaffected\" is false.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. In resistive MHD the diffusion term with $\\eta > 0$ automatically damps any nonzero $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$ to $0$, so strict enforcement is unnecessary; any temporary violation merely renormalizes magnetic pressure isotropically and leaves energy conservation intact.**\n\n    This is incorrect. The divergence of the induction equation is $\\partial_t(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) = \\nabla \\cdot [\\nabla \\times (\\dots)] = 0$. The physical resistivity term does not damp $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$. Furthermore, the spurious force is not an isotropic pressure correction, and energy conservation is explicitly violated.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. A nonzero $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$ primarily changes the Alfvén wave speed while leaving the energy balance unchanged; the momentum equation remains physically correct as long as Ampère’s law without displacement current is used.**\n\n    This is incorrect. The primary effect is the introduction of unphysical forces and energy sources, which is a more fundamental error than a modification of wave speeds. The energy balance is not unchanged. The momentum equation becomes incorrect when conservative forms are used.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Maintaining $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$ is necessary only in ideal MHD; in resistive MHD one may allow small $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\ne 0$ to mimic magnetic reconnection, and the resulting additional term produces physical heating that replaces $\\eta \\mathbf{J}^2$ in the magnetic energy equation.**\n\n    This is incorrect. The consistency requirement holds for both ideal and resistive MHD. Allowing $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\neq 0$ is unphysical and has nothing to do with modelling magnetic reconnection, which is a physical process governed by non-ideal terms like resistivity. The spurious energy source is not a physical heating term and does not replace Ohmic dissipation.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
