This first exercise introduces the powerful technique of scale analysis, a cornerstone of deriving fluid equations for specific physical regimes.

            "problem": "Consider electrostatic, quasi-neutral fusion plasma turbulence in a straight, uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ with slab geometry. Assume isothermal ions and electrons with total barotropic pressure $p = n (T_{e} + T_{i})$ and ion sound speed $c_{s} = \\sqrt{(T_{e} + T_{i})/m_{i}}$, where $n$ is the number density, $T_{e}$ and $T_{i}$ are the electron and ion temperatures, and $m_{i}$ is the ion mass. The electric field is $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\phi$, and the dominant perpendicular flow is the $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ drift $\\mathbf{v}_{E} = \\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}/B^{2}$.\n\nStarting from the ion kinetic description given by the Vlasov equation and taking velocity moments, one obtains the ion continuity equation $\\partial_{t} n + \\nabla \\cdot (n \\mathbf{v}) = 0$ and the ion momentum equation $m_{i} n (\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{v}) = -\\nabla p + n e (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$, with $e$ the elementary charge. In the drift-fluid regime, the characteristic perpendicular length scale is $L_{\\perp}$, the perpendicular flow speed is $V_{\\perp} \\sim |\\mathbf{v}_{E}|$, and the Mach number is $M \\equiv V_{\\perp}/c_{s} \\ll 1$. Take the fluctuation timescale to be set by advective transport, $\\omega \\sim V_{\\perp}/L_{\\perp}$, and the anisotropy $k_{\\parallel} \\ll k_{\\perp}$ so that parallel compressibility does not dominate the perpendicular vorticity dynamics. The magnetic field is uniform so $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{E} = 0$ and compressibility arises only from finite density variations and higher-order drifts.\n\nUsing these premises and without invoking any model-specific closure beyond isothermal barotropic pressure, establish the low-Mach-number ordering for the drift-fluid derivation by estimating the density fluctuation amplitude from the momentum equation and then quantifying the compressibility relative to the vorticity dynamics. Specifically, derive the leading-order dimensionless ratio\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}|}{|\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{v}_{E}|}\n$$\nin terms of the Mach number $M$, assuming that the vorticity is set by the $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ shear and the compressibility is controlled by the low-Mach-number density fluctuations through the continuity equation. Express the final answer for $R$ as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $M$. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The objective is to derive the leading-order dimensionless ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}|}{|\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{v}_{E}|}$ in terms of the Mach number $M$ for the described plasma system. This requires estimating the magnitudes of the flow compressibility, $|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}|$, and the vorticity of the $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ flow, $|\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{v}_{E}|$, using the provided physical parameters and governing equations.\n\nFirst, we estimate the magnitude of the vorticity of the $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ flow. The problem states that the characteristic perpendicular flow speed is $V_{\\perp} \\sim |\\mathbf{v}_{E}|$ and this flow varies over a characteristic perpendicular length scale $L_{\\perp}$. The vorticity, being a measure of the local fluid rotation, is given by the curl of the velocity field. Therefore, its magnitude can be estimated through scale analysis as:\n$$\n|\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{v}_{E}| \\sim \\frac{|\\mathbf{v}_{E}|}{L_{\\perp}} \\sim \\frac{V_{\\perp}}{L_{\\perp}}\n$$\nThis establishes the scaling for the denominator of the ratio $R$.\n\nNext, we estimate the magnitude of the flow compressibility, $|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}|$. The problem instructs us to use the continuity equation, which relates compressibility to density variations. The ion continuity equation is given as:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} n + \\nabla \\cdot (n \\mathbf{v}) = 0\n$$\nExpanding the divergence term, $\\nabla \\cdot (n \\mathbf{v}) = n (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla n$, and rearranging for $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ gives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = -\\frac{1}{n} (\\partial_{t} n + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla n) = -\\frac{1}{n} \\frac{dn}{dt}\n$$\nwhere $\\frac{d}{dt} \\equiv \\partial_t + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla$ is the total time derivative. To estimate the magnitude of $|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}|$, we consider small fluctuations $\\tilde{n}$ around a mean density $n_0$, such that $n = n_0 + \\tilde{n}$. The velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is approximated by its dominant component, $\\mathbf{v}_E$. The fluctuation timescale is $\\omega \\sim V_{\\perp}/L_{\\perp}$. The scale of the total derivative operator is $|\\frac{d}{dt}| \\sim |\\partial_t + \\mathbf{v}_E \\cdot \\nabla| \\sim \\omega + V_{\\perp}/L_{\\perp} \\sim V_{\\perp}/L_{\\perp}$. Applying this to the density fluctuation $\\tilde{n}$, we get:\n$$\n|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}| \\sim \\frac{1}{n_0} \\left| \\frac{d\\tilde{n}}{dt} \\right| \\sim \\frac{1}{n_0} \\left(\\frac{V_{\\perp}}{L_{\\perp}}\\right) \\tilde{n} = \\left(\\frac{V_{\\perp}}{L_{\\perp}}\\right) \\frac{\\tilde{n}}{n_0}\n$$\nThis expression for compressibility depends on the relative density fluctuation amplitude, $\\tilde{n}/n_0$.\n\nThe problem directs us to estimate $\\tilde{n}/n_0$ from the ion momentum equation. The perpendicular component of the momentum equation is:\n$$\nm_{i} n (\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{v})_{\\perp} = -\\nabla_{\\perp} p + n e (\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\perp} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nIn the low-Mach-number limit ($M \\ll 1$), the flow is dominated by the $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ drift, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp} \\approx \\mathbf{v}_{E}$. At the lowest order, the Lorentz force term is balanced, as $e(\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp} + \\mathbf{v}_{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}) = 0$ (since $\\mathbf{v}_E \\times \\mathbf{B} = (\\frac{\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}}{B^2})\\times \\mathbf{B} = -\\mathbf{E}_\\perp$). The flow dynamics are driven by the balance of the next-order terms. These are the ion inertia term on the left-hand side and the pressure gradient force on the right-hand side. The balance between these terms determines the characteristics of the fluctuations.\n\nLet's estimate the magnitude of these two terms. The inertial term, approximating $\\mathbf{v} \\approx \\mathbf{v}_E$ and $n \\approx n_0$, scales as:\n$$\n|m_{i} n (\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{v})_{\\perp}| \\sim m_i n_0 |\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_E}{dt}| \\sim m_i n_0 \\frac{V_{\\perp}^2}{L_{\\perp}}\n$$\nThe pressure gradient term scales as:\n$$\n|\\nabla_{\\perp} p| \\sim \\frac{\\tilde{p}}{L_{\\perp}}\n$$\nGiven the barotropic pressure law $p = n(T_e + T_i)$ and assuming isothermal temperatures, the pressure fluctuation $\\tilde{p}$ is related to the density fluctuation $\\tilde{n}$ by $\\tilde{p} = \\tilde{n}(T_e + T_i)$. So,\n$$\n|\\nabla_{\\perp} p| \\sim \\frac{\\tilde{n}(T_e + T_i)}{L_{\\perp}}\n$$\nEquating the magnitudes of the inertial and pressure gradient terms establishes the dominant balance governing the fluctuations:\n$$\nm_i n_0 \\frac{V_{\\perp}^2}{L_{\\perp}} \\sim \\frac{\\tilde{n}(T_e + T_i)}{L_{\\perp}}\n$$\nSolving for the relative density fluctuation amplitude $\\tilde{n}/n_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tilde{n}}{n_0} \\sim \\frac{m_i V_{\\perp}^2}{T_e + T_i}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the ion sound speed, $c_s^2 = (T_e + T_i)/m_i$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tilde{n}}{n_0} \\sim \\frac{V_{\\perp}^2}{c_s^2} = M^2\n$$\nwhere $M \\equiv V_{\\perp}/c_s$ is the Mach number. This shows that the density fluctuations are of second order in the Mach number.\n\nNow we can substitute this result back into our expression for the compressibility:\n$$\n|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}| \\sim \\left(\\frac{V_{\\perp}}{L_{\\perp}}\\right) \\frac{\\tilde{n}}{n_0} \\sim \\left(\\frac{V_{\\perp}}{L_{\\perp}}\\right) M^2\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}|}{|\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{v}_{E}|} \\sim \\frac{(V_{\\perp}/L_{\\perp}) M^2}{V_{\\perp}/L_{\\perp}}\n$$\nThe scaling factors cancel, yielding the final relationship:\n$$\nR \\sim M^2\n$$\nIn the context of scaling analysis, the proportionality constant is of order unity. Therefore, the leading-order expression for the ratio is $M^2$. This result signifies that in the low-Mach-number regime, the flow is quasi-incompressible, as the compressibility ($|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}|$) is much smaller (by a factor of $M^2$) than the vorticity ($|\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{v}_{E}|$).",

            "solution": "The derivation proceeds in four steps: (1) determining the electron density response from the parallel momentum balance, (2) using Poisson's equation to relate the potential to charge separation, (3) combining these results to find the correction to quasi-neutrality, and (4) calculating the critical wavenumber.\n\n**1. Electron Density Response**\n\nThe problem states that for electrons, the parallel momentum balance reduces to a force balance between the parallel electric field force and the electron pressure gradient force. This neglects electron inertia, which is valid for low-frequency phenomena ($|\\omega| \\ll k_{\\parallel} v_{the}$, where $v_{the}$ is the electron thermal velocity). The linearized parallel momentum equation for the electron fluid is:\n$$n_{e} (-e) E_{\\parallel} - \\nabla_{\\parallel} p_{e} = 0$$\nWe linearize this equation by letting $n_{e} = n_{0} + n_{e1}$ and $p_{e} = p_{e0} + p_{e1}$, where subscripts $0$ and $1$ denote equilibrium and perturbed quantities, respectively. The electrostatic potential $\\phi$ and the resulting parallel electric field $E_{\\parallel}$ are first-order quantities.\n$$ (n_{0} + n_{e1}) (-e) E_{\\parallel} - \\nabla_{\\parallel} (p_{e0} + p_{e1}) = 0 $$\nAssuming a uniform equilibrium, $\\nabla_{\\parallel} p_{e0} = 0$. Keeping only first-order terms, the equation becomes:\n$$ -n_{0} e E_{\\parallel} - \\nabla_{\\parallel} p_{e1} = 0 $$\nThe parallel electric field is the parallel component of the gradient of the scalar potential, $E_{\\parallel} = -\\nabla_{\\parallel} \\phi$. For isothermal electrons, the perturbed pressure is $p_{e1} = n_{e1} T_{e}$, where the temperature $T_{e}$ is constant. Substituting these into the force balance equation yields:\n$$ -n_{0} e (-\\nabla_{\\parallel} \\phi) - \\nabla_{\\parallel} (n_{e1} T_{e}) = 0 $$\n$$ n_{0} e \\nabla_{\\parallel} \\phi - T_{e} \\nabla_{\\parallel} n_{e1} = 0 $$\nWe transform this equation into Fourier space by replacing the operator $\\nabla$ with $i\\mathbf{k}$.

Poisson's Equation**\n\nPoisson's equation relates the electrostatic potential to the net charge density $\\rho_{c}$. For a singly ionized plasma with ion charge $+e$ and electron charge $-e$, the charge density is $\\rho_{c} = e n_{i} - e n_{e}$.

From the electron Boltzmann response, we express the potential as $\\phi = \\frac{n_{e1} T_{e}}{n_{0} e}$. Substituting this into the Fourier-transformed Poisson's equation gives:\n$$ n_{i1} - n_{e1} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{0} k^2}{e} \\left( \\frac{n_{e1} T_{e}}{n_{0} e} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_{0} T_{e}}{n_{0} e^2} \\right) k^2 n_{e1} $$\nWe recognize the term in parentheses as the square of the electron Debye length, $\\lambda_{D}^2 \\equiv \\frac{\\epsilon_{0} T_{e}}{n_{0} e^2}$. The relation becomes:\n$$ n_{i1} - n_{e1} = k^2 \\lambda_{D}^2 n_{e1} $$\nThis expression represents the correction to quasi-neutrality ($n_{i1} = n_{e1}$) due to finite Debye length effects. The deviation from quasi-neutrality is proportional to $k^2 \\lambda_{D}^2$, indicating that it becomes significant at short wavelengths (large $k$).\n\n**4. Fractional Deviation and Critical Wavenumber**\n\nThe fractional deviation from quasi-neutrality is defined as $\\Delta \\equiv \\frac{|n_{e1} - n_{i1}|}{|n_{e1}|}$. Using our result from step 3:\n$$ |n_{e1} - n_{i1}| = |-k^2 \\lambda_{D}^2 n_{e1}| = k^2 \\lambda_{D}^2 |n_{e1}| $$\nsince $k^2$ and $\\lambda_{D}^2$ are non-negative.\nSubstituting this into the definition of $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{k^2 \\lambda_{D}^2 |n_{e1}|}{|n_{e1}|} = k^2 \\lambda_{D}^2 $$\nThe problem specifies the drift-wave ordering $k_{\\perp} \\gg k_{\\parallel}$, which implies that $k^2 = k_{\\perp}^2 + k_{\\parallel}^2 \\approx k_{\\perp}^2$. With this approximation, the fractional deviation becomes:\n$$ \\Delta \\approx k_{\\perp}^2 \\lambda_{D}^2 $$\nWe are asked to find the perpendicular wavenumber scale, denoted $k_{\\perp,c}$, at which this deviation reaches a specified value $\\delta$.

For the equations to match completely, the coefficients of the $\\omega^2$ term must also be equal:\n$$\ni \\frac{C}{|k_{\\parallel}| v_{te}} = i \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{|k_{\\parallel}| v_{te}}\n$$\nThis equality directly implies the analytical value for the closure parameter:\n$$\nC = \\sqrt{\\pi}\n$$\nThis ensures that the fluid model correctly captures the collisionless damping rate predicted by the more fundamental kinetic theory in the drift-wave regime.",
