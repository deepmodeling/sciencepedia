            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It describes a standard classical scattering problem (Rutherford scattering) and asks for the derivation of fundamental quantities using first principles. All necessary parameters are provided, and the objectives are clearly defined. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is solved in two parts as requested. First, we derive the general expression for the distance of closest approach, $r_{\\min}$. Second, we derive the condition for large-angle scattering and use it to find the specific value of $r_{\\min}$ at the threshold of this regime.\n\nFor the first part, we seek an expression for the distance of closest approach, $r_{\\min}$. This is a turning point in the radial motion of the effective one-body system. We begin by applying the principles of conservation of energy and angular momentum in the center-of-mass frame.\n\nThe total energy $E$ is the sum of the kinetic energy $T$ and the potential energy $V(r)$. In polar coordinates $(r, \\phi)$, the kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{1}{2}m_r(\\dot{r}^2 + r^2\\dot{\\phi}^2)$. The total energy is thus:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}m_r\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_r r^2\\dot{\\phi}^2 + V(r)$$\nThe magnitude of the angular momentum, $L$, is a conserved quantity for a central force, given by $L = m_r r^2 \\dot{\\phi}$. We can use this to eliminate $\\dot{\\phi}$ from the energy equation: $\\dot{\\phi} = L/(m_r r^2)$. Substituting this into the energy expression gives:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}m_r\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_r r^2 \\left(\\frac{L}{m_r r^2}\\right)^2 + V(r) = \\frac{1}{2}m_r\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{L^2}{2m_r r^2} + V(r)$$\nThis equation describes the radial motion in terms of an effective potential $V_{\\text{eff}}(r) = \\frac{L^2}{2m_r r^2} + V(r)$. The distance of closest approach, $r_{\\min}$, is the turning point of the trajectory where the radial velocity $\\dot{r}$ becomes zero. At this point, the particle momentarily stops approaching the scattering center and begins to move away.\nSetting $\\dot{r} = 0$ in the radial energy equation, we find the condition for $r_{\\min}$:\n$$E = \\frac{L^2}{2m_r r_{\\min}^2} + V(r_{\\min})$$\nThe problem provides the expressions for the initial energy $E = \\frac{1}{2}m_r v^2$, the angular momentum magnitude $L = m_r v b$, and the repulsive Coulomb potential $V(r) = \\kappa/r$, with $\\kappa = Z_1 Z_2 e^2 / (4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0)$. Substituting these into the condition for $r_{\\min}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m_r v^2 = \\frac{(m_r v b)^2}{2m_r r_{\\min}^2} + \\frac{\\kappa}{r_{\\min}}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m_r v^2 = \\frac{m_r^2 v^2 b^2}{2m_r r_{\\min}^2} + \\frac{\\kappa}{r_{\\min}}$$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m_r v^2 = \\frac{m_r v^2 b^2}{2 r_{\\min}^2} + \\frac{\\kappa}{r_{\\min}}$$\nTo solve for $r_{\\min}$, we can multiply the entire equation by $2r_{\\min}^2$:\n$$m_r v^2 r_{\\min}^2 = m_r v^2 b^2 + 2 \\kappa r_{\\min}$$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form, $Ar_{\\min}^2 + Br_{\\min} + C = 0$:\n$$(m_r v^2) r_{\\min}^2 - (2 \\kappa) r_{\\min} - (m_r v^2 b^2) = 0$$\nWe solve for $r_{\\min}$ using the quadratic formula, $r_{\\min} = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$:\n$$r_{\\min} = \\frac{2\\kappa \\pm \\sqrt{(-2\\kappa)^2 - 4(m_r v^2)(-m_r v^2 b^2)}}{2(m_r v^2)}$$\n$$r_{\\min} = \\frac{2\\kappa \\pm \\sqrt{4\\kappa^2 + 4(m_r v^2 b)^2}}{2m_r v^2}$$\n$$r_{\\min} = \\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{4(\\kappa^2 + (m_r v^2 b)^2)}}{2m_r v^2} = \\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2}\\right)^2 + b^2}$$\nSince the distance of closest approach $r_{\\min}$ must be a positive real number, we must choose the positive sign. The first term is positive (repulsive interaction, $\\kappa>0$), and the square root term is strictly greater than the first term. Thus, the physical solution is:\n$$r_{\\min} = \\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2}\\right)^2 + b^2}$$\nSubstituting $\\kappa = \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0}$, the first part of the problem is solved.\n\nFor the second part, we must find the threshold distance of closest approach for large-angle scattering, defined as a scattering angle $\\theta \\ge \\pi/2$. This requires deriving the relationship between the impact parameter $b$ and the scattering angle $\\theta$. We start from the central-force equation of motion, which is most conveniently expressed by the Binet equation. For a repulsive force $F(r) = \\kappa/r^2$, Newton's second law in the radial direction is $m_r(\\ddot{r}-r\\dot{\\phi}^2) = \\kappa/r^2$. Using the transformations $u = 1/r$ and the conservation of angular momentum $L=m_r r^2 \\dot{\\phi}$, this equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^2 u}{d\\phi^2} + u = -\\frac{m_r}{L^2 u^2} F(1/u) = -\\frac{m_r}{L^2 u^2} (\\kappa u^2) = -\\frac{m_r \\kappa}{L^2}$$\nThe general solution to this inhomogeneous second-order linear differential equation is:\n$$u(\\phi) = A \\cos(\\phi - \\phi_0) - \\frac{m_r \\kappa}{L^2}$$\nBy choosing the axis of symmetry such that the point of closest approach occurs at $\\phi=0$, we set $\\phi_0=0$. The trajectory is given by $u(\\phi) = A \\cos(\\phi) - \\frac{m_r \\kappa}{L^2}$. The particle comes from $r \\to \\infty$ (i.e., $u \\to 0$) and is deflected to $r \\to \\infty$. The asymptotic angles $\\pm\\phi_\\infty$ are found by setting $u(\\phi_\\infty)=0$:\n$$0 = A \\cos(\\phi_\\infty) - \\frac{m_r \\kappa}{L^2} \\implies \\cos(\\phi_\\infty) = \\frac{m_r \\kappa}{A L^2}$$\nThe total scattering angle is $\\theta = \\pi - 2\\phi_\\infty$. From this, $\\phi_\\infty = (\\pi - \\theta)/2$, and $\\cos(\\phi_\\infty) = \\cos(\\pi/2 - \\theta/2) = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nTo find the constant $A$, we use the conservation of energy $E = \\frac{1}{2}m_r v^2$. The energy can also be expressed in terms of the parameters of the orbit solution: $E = \\frac{L^2 A^2}{2m_r} - \\frac{m_r \\kappa^2}{2L^2}$. Substituting $E = \\frac{1}{2}m_r v^2$ and $L=m_r v b$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m_r v^2 = \\frac{(m_r v b)^2 A^2}{2m_r} - \\frac{m_r \\kappa^2}{2(m_r v b)^2} \\implies 1=b^2 A^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2 b}\\right)^2$$\nSolving for $A$: $A = \\frac{1}{b}\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2 b}\\right)^2}$.\nNow we can write $\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n$$\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) = \\frac{m_r \\kappa}{L^2} \\frac{1}{A} = \\frac{m_r \\kappa}{(m_r v b)^2} \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2 b}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2 b}}{\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2 b}\\right)^2}}$$\nFrom this, we deduce that $\\tan(\\theta/2) = \\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2 b}$.\nThe threshold for large-angle scattering is $\\theta = \\pi/2$. At this angle, $\\tan(\\theta/2) = \\tan(\\pi/4) = 1$.\nThe condition on the impact parameter $b$ is therefore:\n$$1 = \\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2 b} \\implies b = b_{90} = \\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2}$$\nThis is the impact parameter at the threshold of large-angle scattering. To find the corresponding distance of closest approach, $r_{\\min}^{(\\theta \\ge \\pi/2)}$, we substitute this value of $b$ into our previously derived expression for $r_{\\min}$:\n$$r_{\\min}^{(\\theta \\ge \\pi/2)} = \\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2}\\right)^2}$$\n$$r_{\\min}^{(\\theta \\ge \\pi/2)} = \\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2} + \\sqrt{2\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2} + \\sqrt{2}\\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2}$$\n$$r_{\\min}^{(\\theta \\ge \\pi/2)} = (1+\\sqrt{2})\\frac{\\kappa}{m_r v^2}$$\nFinally, we substitute the definition of $\\kappa = \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0}$:\n$$r_{\\min}^{(\\theta \\ge \\pi/2)} = (1+\\sqrt{2}) \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 m_r v^2}$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the threshold distance of closest approach, expressed purely in terms of the given parameters. The expression has units of distance (meters in SI units), as required.",

Therefore, the problem is valid, and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem asks for three main components: a derivation of the logarithmic sensitivity of collisional diffusion, the analytical correction to the Coulomb logarithm due to finite system size, and a numerical evaluation of this correction.\n\nFirst, we derive the origin of the Coulomb logarithm, which represents the logarithmic sensitivity to the range of impact parameters. We consider an electron of charge $-e$, mass $m_{e}$, and velocity $v$ undergoing a small-angle collision with a stationary ion of charge $+e$. The impact parameter is $b$.\n\nIn the small-angle scattering approximation, the electron's trajectory is assumed to be a nearly straight line.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the scaling of the electron-ion collision frequency $\\nu_{ei}$, electron mean free path $\\lambda_e$, and parallel electron thermal conductivity $\\kappa_{\\parallel}$ with respect to the Coulomb logarithm $\\ln\\Lambda$. The derivation is to be performed under the assumption that the electron number density $n_e$, electron temperature $T_e$, and ion charge number $Z$ are held constant. For this problem, we are given $Z=1$.\n\nFirst, we determine the dependence of the electron-ion collision frequency $\\nu_{ei}$ on the Coulomb logarithm $\\ln\\Lambda$. The foundation of Coulomb collisions in a plasma is the Rutherford scattering cross section. For an electron of charge $-e$ and mass $m_e$ scattering off a static ion of charge $Ze$, the differential cross section is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0 m_e v^2 \\sin^2(\\frac{\\theta}{2})} \\right)^2\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the electron speed and $\\theta$ is the scattering angle. In a weakly collisional plasma, momentum transfer is dominated by the cumulative effect of many small-angle deflections, not by single large-angle scattering events. The relationship between the impact parameter $b$ and the scattering angle $\\theta$ is given by $\\cot(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m_e v^2 b}{Z e^2}$. For small angles, $\\theta \\ll 1$, this simplifies to $\\theta \\approx \\frac{Z e^2}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 m_e v^2 b}$.\n\nThe Fokker-Planck (FP) or Landau collision operator describes this process as a diffusion in velocity space. The collision frequency $\\nu_{ei}$ can be understood as the inverse of the time required for a typical electron's velocity vector to be deflected by an angle of order $90^\\circ$ through such cumulative small-angle events. The mean squared scattering angle $\\langle(\\Delta\\theta)^2\\rangle$ accumulates over time. The rate of accumulation is found by integrating over all possible impact parameters $b$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle(\\Delta\\theta)^2\\rangle}{dt} = \\int n_i v \\theta^2(b) 2\\pi b \\, db\n$$\nHere, $n_i$ is the ion density, and $n_i v (2\\pi b \\, db)$ is the rate of collisions with impact parameters between $b$ and $b+db$. Substituting the expression for $\\theta(b)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle(\\Delta\\theta)^2\\rangle}{dt} = n_i v \\int \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 m_e v^2 b} \\right)^2 2\\pi b \\, db = 2\\pi n_i v \\left( \\frac{Z e^2}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 m_e v^2} \\right)^2 \\int_{b_{min}}^{b_{max}} \\frac{db}{b}\n$$\nThe integral diverges logarithmically and must be cut off at a minimum impact parameter, $b_{min}$, and a maximum, $b_{max}$. The minimum impact parameter corresponds to the larger of the classical distance of closest approach for a head-on collision or the de Broglie wavelength. The maximum impact parameter is the Debye screening length, $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e / (n_e e^2)}$, beyond which the ion's potential is screened by the plasma.\nThe integral evaluates to $\\ln(b_{max}/b_{min})$, which is defined as the Coulomb logarithm, $\\ln\\Lambda$.\nThe $90^\\circ$ deflection time $\\tau_{90}$ is the time over which $\\langle(\\Delta\\theta)^2\\rangle \\approx 1$. Thus, the collision frequency $\\nu \\sim 1/\\tau_{90} \\sim d\\langle(\\Delta\\theta)^2\\rangle/dt$. For a thermal distribution of electrons with characteristic velocity $v \\sim v_{Te} \\propto T_e^{1/2}$, and noting quasineutrality $n_i Z = n_e$ (so $n_i = n_e$ for $Z=1$), the electron-ion collision frequency scales as:\n$$\n\\nu_{ei} \\propto \\frac{n_e Z^2}{T_e^{3/2}} \\ln\\Lambda\n$$\nSince the problem states that $n_e$, $T_e$, and $Z$ are held fixed, the dependence of $\\nu_{ei}$ on the Coulomb logarithm is simply:\n$$\n\\nu_{ei} \\propto \\ln\\Lambda\n$$\n\nSecond, we deduce the dependence of the electron mean free path $\\lambda_e$ on $\\ln\\Lambda$. The mean free path is the average distance an electron travels between collisions that significantly alter its trajectory. It is defined as the characteristic particle speed divided by the collision frequency. For thermal electrons, the characteristic speed is the thermal velocity $v_{Te} = \\sqrt{2k_B T_e/m_e}$ (the exact numerical factor is irrelevant for scaling).\n$$\n\\lambda_e = \\frac{v_{Te}}{\\nu_{ei}}\n$$\nGiven that $T_e$ is fixed, the electron thermal velocity $v_{Te}$ is also constant. Therefore, the scaling of $\\lambda_e$ is inversely proportional to the scaling of $\\nu_{ei}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_e \\propto \\frac{1}{\\nu_{ei}} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\ln\\Lambda}\n$$\n\nThird, we determine the dependence of the parallel thermal conductivity $\\kappa_{\\parallel}$ on $\\ln\\Lambda$. The parallel heat flux closure $q_{\\parallel} = -\\kappa_{\\parallel}\\nabla_{\\parallel}T_e$ is derived from kinetic theory, typically using a Chapman-Enskog expansion of the electron drift-kinetic equation. This method expands the electron distribution function $f_e$ around a local Maxwellian $f_{e0}$, i.e., $f_e = f_{e0} + f_{e1} + \\dots$, where the perturbation $f_{e1}$ is small. The first-order kinetic equation, which determines the heat flux, takes the form:\n$$\nv_{\\parallel} \\nabla_{\\parallel} f_{e0} = C(f_{e1})\n$$\nwhere $C(f_{e1})$ is the linearized collision operator. The term $\\nabla_{\\parallel} f_{e0}$ represents the thermodynamic drive, which is proportional to gradients like $\\nabla_{\\parallel}T_e$. The heat flux is calculated from the third velocity moment of the perturbation $f_{e1}$: $q_{\\parallel} = \\int (\\frac{1}{2}m_e v^2) v_{\\parallel} f_{e1} d^3v$.\nA simplified but effective model for the collision operator is the Krook operator, $C(f_{e1}) \\approx -\\nu_{ei} f_{e1}$, where $\\nu_{ei}$ is the effective collision frequency for the process. This approximation captures the essential scaling. In this model, the perturbation to the distribution function is:\n$$\nf_{e1} \\approx -\\frac{1}{\\nu_{ei}} v_{\\parallel} \\nabla_{\\parallel} f_{e0}\n$$\nSince $\\nabla_{\\parallel}f_{e0}$ is proportional to $\\nabla_{\\parallel}T_e$, we find that $f_{e1} \\propto (1/\\nu_{ei}) \\nabla_{\\parallel}T_e$. Substituting this into the integral for the heat flux $q_{\\parallel}$:\n$$\nq_{\\parallel} \\propto \\int (\\dots) f_{e1} d^3v \\propto \\frac{1}{\\nu_{ei}}\\nabla_{\\parallel}T_e \\int (\\dots) d^3v\n$$\nThe integral over velocity space yields coefficients that depend on $n_e$ and $T_e$, but not on the collision frequency itself. Comparing with the definition $q_{\\parallel} = -\\kappa_{\\parallel}\\nabla_{\\parallel}T_e$, we find the scaling for the Spitzer–Härm (SH) thermal conductivity:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\parallel} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\nu_{ei}}\n$$\nThis fundamental result states that transport is inversely proportional to the collision rate. A more rigorous derivation using the full Fokker-Planck operator confirms this scaling. Since we have already established that $\\nu_{ei} \\propto \\ln\\Lambda$ at fixed $n_e$ and $T_e$, it follows that:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\parallel} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\ln\\Lambda}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required dimensionless ratios using the given numerical values $\\ln\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{core}}=17$ and $\\ln\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{edge}}=11$.\n\n$1$. Ratio of electron-ion collision frequencies:\n$$\n\\frac{\\nu_{ei,\\mathrm{edge}}}{\\nu_{ei,\\mathrm{core}}} = \\frac{\\ln\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{edge}}}{\\ln\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{core}}} = \\frac{11}{17} \\approx 0.6470588...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.6471$.\n\n$2$. Ratio of electron mean free paths:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{edge}}}{\\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{core}}} = \\frac{(\\ln\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{edge}})^{-1}}{(\\ln\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{core}})^{-1}} = \\frac{\\ln\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{core}}}{\\ln\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{edge}}} = \\frac{17}{11} \\approx 1.545454...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.545$.\n\n$3$. Ratio of parallel thermal conductivities:\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa_{\\parallel,\\mathrm{edge}}}{\\kappa_{\\parallel,\\mathrm{core}}} = \\frac{(\\ln\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{edge}})^{-1}}{(\\ln\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{core}})^{-1}} = \\frac{\\ln\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{core}}}{\\ln\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{edge}}} = \\frac{17}{11} \\approx 1.545454...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.545$.\n\nThese results indicate that in the plasma edge region, with its lower Coulomb logarithm, collisions are less frequent, the electron mean free path is longer, and the parallel thermal conductivity is higher, assuming all other parameters are the same.",
