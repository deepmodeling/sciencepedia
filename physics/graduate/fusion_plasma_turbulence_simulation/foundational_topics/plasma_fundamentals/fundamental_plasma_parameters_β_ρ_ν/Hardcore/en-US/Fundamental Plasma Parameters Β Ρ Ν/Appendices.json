It is derived from the Lorentz force, where the magnetic force provides the necessary centripetal force for circular motion of a particle with charge $Ze$ and mass $m_i$ moving with perpendicular velocity $v_{\\perp}$ in a magnetic field of magnitude $B$:\n$$\nm_i \\frac{v_{\\perp}^2}{r} = Z e v_{\\perp} B\n$$\nThe gyroradius is $r = \\frac{m_i v_{\\perp}}{Z e B}$ and the angular frequency is $\\Omega_{ci} = \\frac{v_{\\perp}}{r}$.

This is the phase speed of longitudinal ion-acoustic waves, which arise from the interplay between electron pressure and ion inertia. We consider a one-dimensional perturbation propagating along the magnetic field direction, which we take as the $z$-axis. The electron momentum balance equation, assuming negligible electron inertia and an isothermal equation of state $p_e = n T_e$ (with $T_e$ being a uniform temperature in energy units), establishes a relationship between the electric field $E_z$ and the density perturbation $n_1$. For a small perturbation from a uniform state ($n = n_0 + n_1, \\mathbf{E} = E_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$):\n$$\n0 \\approx -e n E_z - \\frac{\\partial p_e}{\\partial z} \\implies e n_0 E_z \\approx -\\frac{\\partial (n_1 T_e)}{\\partial z} = -T_e \\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial z}\n$$\nSo the electric field is $E_z \\approx -\\frac{T_e}{e n_0} \\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial z}$.\nThe linearized ion continuity equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial t} + n_0 \\frac{\\partial v_{iz}}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nThe linearized ion momentum equation in the $z$-direction, neglecting the ion pressure gradient (the \"cold ion\" approximation implicit in the standard definition of $C_s$), is:\n$$\nm_i n_0 \\frac{\\partial v_{iz}}{\\partial t} = Z e n_0 E_z = e n_0 E_z\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_z$:\n$$\nm_i \\frac{\\partial v_{iz}}{\\partial t} = -T_e \\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial z}\n$$\nTo find a wave equation, we take the time derivative of the ion continuity equation and the spatial derivative of the ion momentum equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 n_1}{\\partial t^2} = -n_0 \\frac{\\partial^2 v_{iz}}{\\partial t \\partial z}\n$$\n$$\nm_i \\frac{\\partial^2 v_{iz}}{\\partial z \\partial t} = -T_e \\frac{\\partial^2 n_1}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nCombining these two results yields the wave equation for the density perturbation $n_1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 n_1}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{n_0 T_e}{m_i} \\frac{\\partial^2 n_1}{\\partial z^2} \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 n_1}{\\partial t^2} - \\frac{T_e}{m_i} \\frac{\\partial^2 n_1}{\\partial z^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is the standard form of a wave equation, $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial t^2} - c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2} = 0$, where the wave speed $c$ is given by $c^2 = T_e/m_i$. Thus, the ion sound speed is:\n$$\nC_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{T_e}{m_i}}\n$$\nwhere $T_e$ is the electron temperature in energy units (Joules).\n\nThe ion-sound gyroradius, $\\rho_s$, is a characteristic length scale in plasma turbulence, defined as the ion sound speed divided by the ion cyclotron frequency:\n$$\n\\rho_s = \\frac{C_s}{\\Omega_{ci}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{T_e/m_i}}{eB/m_i} = \\frac{m_i \\sqrt{T_e/m_i}}{eB} = \\frac{\\sqrt{m_i T_e}}{e B}\n$$\n\nNext, we define the ion thermal gyroradius, $\\rho_i$. This is the gyroradius of an ion with a characteristic thermal velocity. The problem specifies using the \"perpendicular ion thermal speed\". For a thermal distribution of particles at temperature $T_i$, the energy is distributed among the available degrees of freedom. The kinetic energy associated with motion perpendicular to the magnetic field involves two degrees of freedom. According to the equipartition theorem, the average kinetic energy in these two dimensions is $\\langle \\frac{1}{2}m_i v_{\\perp}^2 \\rangle = k_B T_i$. As the temperatures are treated as energies per particle, we write this as $\\langle \\frac{1}{2}m_i v_{\\perp}^2 \\rangle = T_i$. The corresponding root-mean-square (RMS) perpendicular speed is:\n$$\nv_{th,i,\\perp} = \\sqrt{\\langle v_{\\perp}^2 \\rangle} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 T_i}{m_i}}\n$$\nThis RMS speed is the most rigorous and physically meaningful interpretation of the \"perpendicular ion thermal speed\" for a thermal ensemble. The ion thermal gyroradius $\\rho_i$ is then the gyroradius for an ion with this speed:\n$$\n\\rho_i = \\frac{m_i v_{th,i,\\perp}}{e B} = \\frac{m_i}{e B} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 T_i}{m_i}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 m_i T_i}}{e B}\n$$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $\\rho_s/\\rho_i$ by dividing the derived expressions:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_s}{\\rho_i} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{m_i T_e}}{e B}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2 m_i T_i}}{e B}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{m_i T_e}}{\\sqrt{2 m_i T_i}}\n$$\nThe terms $m_i$, $e$, and $B$ cancel out, leaving a simple expression in terms of the electron and ion temperatures:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_s}{\\rho_i} = \\sqrt{\\frac{T_e}{2 T_i}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of this ratio using the given parameters: $T_e = 3.0\\,\\text{keV}$ and $T_i = 10.0\\,\\text{keV}$.

For the second half of the integration range:\n$$\n\\int_{\\pi}^{2\\pi} \\sin(z\\cos\\vartheta) \\,d\\vartheta = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin(z\\cos(\\phi+\\pi)) \\,d\\phi = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin(-z\\cos\\phi) \\,d\\phi = -\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin(z\\cos\\phi) \\,d\\phi\n$$\nThus, the integral over the full range $[0, 2\\pi]$ is zero.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sin(z\\cos\\vartheta) \\,d\\vartheta = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin(z\\cos\\vartheta) \\,d\\vartheta + \\int_{\\pi}^{2\\pi} \\sin(z\\cos\\vartheta) \\,d\\vartheta = 0\n$$\nThe reduction factor $F(z)$ is therefore purely real and is given by the remaining real part of the integral:\n$$\nF(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos(z\\cos\\vartheta) \\,d\\vartheta\n$$\nThe integrand $\\cos(z\\cos\\vartheta)$ is an even function of $\\vartheta$ and is periodic with period $2\\pi$. The integral over $[0, 2\\pi]$ is twice the integral over $[0, \\pi]$:\n$$\nF(z) = \\frac{2}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\cos(z\\cos\\vartheta) \\,d\\vartheta = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\cos(z\\cos\\vartheta) \\,d\\vartheta\n$$\nThis is a standard integral representation of the Bessel function of the first kind of order zero, denoted by $J_0(z)$. Therefore, the FLR reduction factor is:\n$$\nF(k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i}) = J_0(k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i})\n$$\nThe problem defines the FLR-induced damping rate $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{damp}}$ as:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{damp}} = \\gamma_{0} \\left( 1 - F^{2}(k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i}) \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $F(k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i})$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{damp}} = \\gamma_{0} \\left( 1 - J_0^{2}(k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i}) \\right)\n$$\nWe are given the baseline drive $\\gamma_{0} = 2.50 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and are tasked to compute $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{damp}}$ for three values of $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i}$.\n\nCase 1: $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i} = 0.3$\nThe value of the Bessel function is $J_0(0.3) \\approx 0.97762624$.\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{damp},1} = (2.50 \\times 10^{5}) \\left( 1 - (0.97762624)^{2} \\right) \\approx (2.50 \\times 10^{5}) (1 - 0.9557527) = (2.50 \\times 10^{5}) (0.0442473) \\approx 11061.8 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.106 \\times 10^{4} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nCase 2: $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i} = 0.7$\nThe value of the Bessel function is $J_0(0.7) \\approx 0.88120339$.\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{damp},2} = (2.50 \\times 10^{5}) \\left( 1 - (0.88120339)^{2} \\right) \\approx (2.50 \\times 10^{5}) (1 - 0.7765194) = (2.50 \\times 10^{5}) (0.2234806) \\approx 55870.15 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $5.587 \\times 10^{4} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nCase 3: $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i} = 1.2$\nThe value of the Bessel function is $J_0(1.2) \\approx 0.67113274$.\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{damp},3} = (2.50 \\times 10^{5}) \\left( 1 - (0.67113274)^{2} \\right) \\approx (2.50 \\times 10^{5}) (1 - 0.4504189) = (2.50 \\times 10^{5}) (0.5495811) \\approx 137395.27 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.374 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe three requested damping rates are thus calculated and rounded as required.",
