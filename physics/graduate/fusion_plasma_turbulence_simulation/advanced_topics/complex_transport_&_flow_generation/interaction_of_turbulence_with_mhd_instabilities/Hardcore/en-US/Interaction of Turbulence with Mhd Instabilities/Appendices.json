            "problem": "In a high-temperature toroidal plasma, consider the interaction between micro-scale turbulence and a large-scale magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) macro-mode described by single-mode amplitudes. Let the macro-mode amplitude be denoted by $A_{M}(t)$ and the microturbulence amplitude by $A_{m}(t)$. Assume the following physically justified conditions hold over a mesoscopic time window: (i) the macro-mode responds linearly to perturbations with a constant linear growth rate $\\gamma_{M}$ (which may be negative for a linearly stable macro-mode), (ii) the microturbulence rapidly saturates to a statistically steady amplitude $A_{m0}$ on timescales short compared with the macro-mode evolution, and (iii) quadratic beat interactions of the microturbulence provide a constant-in-time nonlinear injection into the macro-mode with an effective coupling coefficient $\\lambda0$.

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem statement implies the governing equation for the macro-mode amplitude $A_{M}(t)$. The rate of change of $A_{M}(t)$, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A_{M}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, is composed of two terms: a linear response term and a nonlinear drive term.\n\n1.  The linear response term is proportional to the amplitude $A_{M}(t)$ itself, with the constant of proportionality being the linear growth rate $\\gamma_{M}$. This term is $\\gamma_{M} A_{M}(t)$.\n2.  The nonlinear drive term arises from \"quadratic beat interactions of the microturbulence\" and is described as a \"constant-in-time nonlinear injection\". This implies the term is proportional to the square of the microturbulence amplitude, $A_{m}^{2}$. Since the microturbulence has saturated to a constant value $A_{m0}$, this drive term is $\\lambda A_{m0}^{2}$, where $\\lambda$ is the positive coupling coefficient.\n\nCombining these terms, we construct the differential equation for $A_{M}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A_{M}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\gamma_{M} A_{M}(t) + \\lambda A_{m0}^{2}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear nonhomogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.

The concepts of $\\mathrm{E}\\times\\mathrm{B}$ drift, sheared flows, rational surfaces, tearing modes, and the suppression of instabilities by flow shear are fundamental and well-established in this field. The given functional forms for the electric and magnetic fields are common, valid simplifications for analytical modeling. The numerical parameters are physically realistic for a modern tokamak.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is self-contained and clearly structured. It provides a specific physical model, a set of governing equations, a clear objective (calculate the minimum required $E_a$), a precise suppression criterion, and all necessary numerical constants. A unique and stable solution can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Flaw Analysis:**\n    1.  **Scientific or Factual Unsoundness:** None. The physics is standard.\n    2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant:** The problem is formalizable and directly relevant to the topic of interaction between turbulence and MHD instabilities.\n    3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** All required information is present and consistent.\n    4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The physical parameters are plausible.\n    5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured:** A unique solution exists.\n    6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological:** The problem requires a straightforward but non-trivial application of calculus to a physical model, which is a standard exercise in the field.\n    7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** The model and its solution are entirely verifiable within the principles of physics and mathematics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe objective is to determine the minimum value of the edge electric field, $E_a$, required to satisfy the tearing mode suppression criterion.\n\nFirst, we define the quantity whose radial gradient we need to compute, which is the radial profile of the $\\mathrm{E}\\times\\mathrm{B}$ drift velocity, $V_E(r)$. The problem states its magnitude is given by:\n$$V_{E}(r) = \\frac{E_r(r)}{B_0}$$\nThe problem provides the radial electric field profile $E_r(r) = E_a \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^p$ and approximates the magnetic field as a constant $B_0$. Substituting these into the expression for $V_E(r)$ gives:\n$$V_{E}(r) = \\frac{1}{B_0} \\left( E_a \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^p \\right) = \\frac{E_a}{B_0 a^p} r^p$$\nThe shear suppression criterion is given in terms of the radial gradient of this velocity, which we denote as the shear rate $\\omega'_E(r)$:\n$$\\omega'_E(r) = \\partial_r V_E(r) = \\partial_r\\left(\\frac{E_r(r)}{B_0}\\right)$$\nWe compute this derivative:\n$$\\omega'_E(r) = \\partial_r\\left(\\frac{E_a}{B_0 a^p} r^p\\right)$$\nSince $E_a$, $B_0$, $a$, and $p$ are constants with respect to the radial coordinate $r$, we can pull them out of the derivative:\n$$\\omega'_E(r) = \\frac{E_a}{B_0 a^p} \\partial_r(r^p) = \\frac{E_a}{B_0 a^p} (p r^{p-1})$$\nThe criterion must be evaluated at the rational surface, $r = r_s$:\n$$\\left.\\omega'_E\\right|_{r_s} = \\left.\\partial_r\\left(\\frac{E_r}{B_0}\\right)\\right|_{r_s} = \\frac{p E_a r_s^{p-1}}{B_0 a^p}$$\nFor completeness, we can also write the alternative shear definition $\\gamma_E(r_s)$:\n$$\\gamma_E(r_s) = r_s \\left.\\partial_r\\left(\\frac{E_r}{B_0}\\right)\\right|_{r_s} = r_s \\left( \\frac{p E_a r_s^{p-1}}{B_0 a^p} \\right) = \\frac{p E_a r_s^p}{B_0 a^p}$$\nThis quantity has units of velocity, consistent with the problem description.\n\nThe suppression criterion is given as:\n$$\\left|\\partial_r\\left(\\frac{E_r}{B_0}\\right)\\right|_{r_s} \\ge \\gamma_{\\mathrm{TM}}$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for the shear rate:\n$$\\left|\\frac{p E_a r_s^{p-1}}{B_0 a^p}\\right| \\ge \\gamma_{\\mathrm{TM}}$$\nThe problem states $E_r(r)$ is a monotonically increasing profile with $p0$, which implies $E_a$ has the same sign as $E_r$. We can assume $E_a  0$. All other parameters ($p$, $r_s$, $B_0$, $a$) are positive physical quantities. Therefore, the term inside the absolute value is positive, and the absolute value signs can be removed.\n$$\\frac{p E_a r_s^{p-1}}{B_0 a^p} \\ge \\gamma_{\\mathrm{TM}}$$\nWe are seeking the minimum value of $E_a$ that satisfies this condition. This minimum, $E_{a,\\text{min}}$, occurs at the equality:\n$$\\frac{p E_{a,\\text{min}} r_s^{p-1}}{B_0 a^p} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{TM}}$$\nWe now solve for $E_{a,\\text{min}}$ algebraically:\n$$E_{a,\\text{min}} = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{TM}} B_0 a^p}{p r_s^{p-1}}$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n- $p = 2$\n- $B_0 = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n- $a = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $r_s = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{TM}} = 2.00 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\n$$E_{a,\\text{min}} = \\frac{(2.00 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (3.0\\,\\mathrm{T}) (0.80\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2}}{2 \\cdot (0.50\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2-1}}$$\n$$E_{a,\\text{min}} = \\frac{(2.00 \\times 10^{4}) (3.0) (0.64)}{2 \\cdot (0.50)}\\, \\frac{\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{T} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2}{\\mathrm{m}}$$\nThe units are $\\mathrm{T \\cdot m \\cdot s^{-1}}$, which is equivalent to $\\mathrm{V/m}$.\n$$E_{a,\\text{min}} = \\frac{(2.00 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot (3.0) \\cdot (0.64)}{1.0}\\,\\mathrm{V/m}$$\n$$E_{a,\\text{min}} = (6.00 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot (0.64)\\,\\mathrm{V/m}$$\n$$E_{a,\\text{min}} = 3.84 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{V/m}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in units of kilovolts per meter ($\\mathrm{kV/m}$).\n$$E_{a,\\text{min}} = 38.4\\,\\mathrm{kV/m}$$\nFinally, the problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$E_{a,\\text{min}} = 38.40\\,\\mathrm{kV/m}$$\nThe numerical value to be reported is $38.40$.",
