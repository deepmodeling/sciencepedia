The validation of the problem statement has confirmed its scientific soundness, consistency, and well-posed nature.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ from fundamental principles of a collisional plasma. The effective ion charge is a parameter that quantifies the effect of a multi-species ion population on processes dominated by electron-ion Coulomb collisions, such as classical electrical resistivity and Bremsstrahlung radiation. We focus on its role in resistivity.\n\nThe electrical resistivity, $\\eta$, of a plasma is determined by the rate of momentum transfer from the current-carrying electrons to the ions via collisions. In the fluid picture, this is described by the friction force. The friction force density, $\\mathbf{R}_{e s}$, exerted on the electron fluid by an ion species $s$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_{e s} = n_e m_e \\nu_{es} (\\mathbf{V}_s - \\mathbf{V}_e)\n$$\nwhere $n_e$ is the electron density, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $\\mathbf{V}_e$ and $\\mathbf{V}_s$ are the fluid velocities of electrons and ion species $s$ respectively, and $\\nu_{es}$ is the momentum-transfer collision frequency between electrons and ion species $s$.\n\nAssuming stationary ions ($\\mathbf{V}_s = \\mathbf{0}$ for all $s$), the total friction force on the electron fluid is the sum over all ion species:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_{ei} = \\sum_s \\mathbf{R}_{es} = -n_e m_e \\left(\\sum_s \\nu_{es}\\right) \\mathbf{V}_e\n$$\nIn steady state, this friction force is balanced by the electric field force, $-n_e e \\mathbf{E}$, required to maintain the electron flow. Thus, $-n_e e \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{R}_{ei} = \\mathbf{0}$, which gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\mathbf{R}_{ei}}{n_e e} = -\\frac{m_e}{e} \\left(\\sum_s \\nu_{es}\\right) \\mathbf{V}_e\n$$\nThe current density is $\\mathbf{j} = -n_e e \\mathbf{V}_e$.

From kinetic theory, $\\nu_{es} \\propto n_s Z_s^2$. Specifically, $\\nu_{es} = C_0 n_s Z_s^2$, where $C_0$ depends on electron temperature and fundamental constants, but not on the ion species properties, assuming the Coulomb logarithm is approximately constant for all species.\nSo, the total resistivity is:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{m_e C_0}{n_e e^2} \\sum_s n_s Z_s^2\n$$\nFor a pure plasma with a single ion species of charge $Z$ and density $n_i$, quasineutrality requires $n_e = Z n_i$.

The effective charge, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, of a multi-species plasma is defined such that the total resistivity is proportional to $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in the same way. By comparing the expressions:\n$$\n\\eta \\propto Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\eta \\propto \\frac{1}{n_e} \\sum_s n_s Z_s^2\n$$\nwe identify the standard definition of the effective ion charge:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\equiv \\frac{\\sum_s n_s Z_s^2}{n_e}\n$$\nUsing the species abundance $f_s = n_s/n_e$, this becomes:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sum_s f_s Z_s^2\n$$\nThis is the expression for $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ derived from the fundamental definition of collisional resistivity.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for the given plasma composition. First, we must find the abundance of the main deuterium ion species, $f_{\\mathrm{D}}$, using the quasineutrality condition, $\\sum_s Z_s f_s = 1$. The sum is over all ion species:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{D}} f_{\\mathrm{D}} + Z_{\\mathrm{He}^{2+}} f_{\\mathrm{He}^{2+}} + Z_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} f_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} + Z_{\\mathrm{C}^{6+}} f_{\\mathrm{C}^{6+}} + Z_{\\mathrm{O}^{6+}} f_{\\mathrm{O}^{6+}} + Z_{\\mathrm{O}^{7+}} f_{\\mathrm{O}^{7+}} + Z_{\\mathrm{W}^{30+}} f_{\\mathrm{W}^{30+}} = 1\n$$\nWith $Z_{\\mathrm{D}}=1$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{D}} = 1 - \\sum_{\\text{impurities}} Z_s f_s\n$$\nThe sum of charge contributions from impurities is:\n$$\n\\sum_{\\text{imp}} Z_s f_s = (2)(0.03) + (5)(0.003) + (6)(0.002) + (6)(0.001) + (7)(0.0005) + (30)(1.0 \\times 10^{-5})\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{\\text{imp}} Z_s f_s = 0.06 + 0.015 + 0.012 + 0.006 + 0.0035 + 0.0003 = 0.0968\n$$\nThus, the deuterium abundance is:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{D}} = 1 - 0.0968 = 0.9032\n$$\nNow we can compute $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sum_s f_s Z_s^2$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = f_{\\mathrm{D}} Z_{\\mathrm{D}}^2 + f_{\\mathrm{He}^{2+}} Z_{\\mathrm{He}^{2+}}^2 + f_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} Z_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}}^2 + f_{\\mathrm{C}^{6+}} Z_{\\mathrm{C}^{6+}}^2 + f_{\\mathrm{O}^{6+}} Z_{\\mathrm{O}^{6+}}^2 + f_{\\mathrm{O}^{7+}} Z_{\\mathrm{O}^{7+}}^2 + f_{\\mathrm{W}^{30+}} Z_{\\mathrm{W}^{30+}}^2\n$$\nSubstituting the given values and the calculated $f_{\\mathrm{D}}$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (0.9032)(1^2) + (0.03)(2^2) + (0.003)(5^2) + (0.002)(6^2) + (0.001)(6^2) + (0.0005)(7^2) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-5})(30^2)\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.9032 + (0.03)(4) + (0.003)(25) + (0.002)(36) + (0.001)(36) + (0.0005)(49) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-5})(900)\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.9032 + 0.12 + 0.075 + 0.072 + 0.036 + 0.0245 + 0.009\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.2397\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.240$.\n\nFinally, we explain the physical consequences of an increased $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n1.  **Modification of collisional damping of microturbulent modes**: Microturbulence, such as Trapped Electron Modes (TEMs) and Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) modes, drives anomalous transport in tokamaks. These modes are subject to damping by collisions. The key collisional process for damping drift-wave-like instabilities is electron-ion collisions, the rate of which is the electron-ion collision frequency, $\\nu_{ei}$. As shown in the derivation, the total collision frequency is $\\nu_{ei} = \\sum_s \\nu_{es} \\propto \\sum_s n_s Z_s^2$. Therefore, $\\nu_{ei} \\propto n_e Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. An increase in $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ via impurity accumulation leads to a proportional increase in the electron-ion collision frequency. For TEMs, which are driven by trapped electron resonances, an increased $\\nu_{ei}$ enhances the rate at which electrons are collisionally scattered out of trapped orbits. This \"detrapping\" effect disrupts the wave-particle resonance that drives the instability, leading to stronger damping of the mode and a potential reduction in turbulent transport. Similar stabilizing effects, though sometimes more complex, apply to other micro-instabilities like ITG and ETG modes.\n\n2.  **Modification of the tendency toward resistive instabilities**: Resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities, such as tearing modes, are driven by finite plasma resistivity, $\\eta$. These instabilities can lead to magnetic island formation and confinement degradation. As established in the derivation of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the classical Spitzer resistivity is directly proportional to the effective charge: $\\eta \\propto Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Therefore, increasing $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ by introducing impurities directly increases the plasma's electrical resistivity. The growth rate, $\\gamma$, of resistive instabilities typically scales as a positive power of the resistivity (e.g., $\\gamma \\propto \\eta^{3/5}$ for the classic tearing mode). A higher resistivity allows magnetic field lines to diffuse and reconnect more readily, facilitating the growth of these modes. Consequently, a higher $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ enhances the drive for resistive instabilities, making the plasma more susceptible to tearing modes and other resistive phenomena, which poses a significant threat to stable tokamak operation.",

First, to derive an expression for the steady-state impurity peaking factor in a fusion plasma, and second, to calculate its numerical value for a given set of transport coefficients. The problem is first validated to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective before proceeding.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Steady-State Peaking Factor**\n\nThe analysis begins with the impurity continuity equation, which describes the time evolution of the impurity density $n_{z}(r,t)$:\n$$ \\partial_{t} n_{z} + \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{z} = S_{z} $$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{z}$ is the impurity particle flux vector, and $S_{z}$ is the impurity source term.\n\nThe problem specifies two conditions for the derivation:\n1.  The plasma is in a steady state, which implies that the impurity density profile is time-invariant, i.e., $\\partial_{t} n_{z} = 0$.\n2.  The impurity source $S_{z}$ can be neglected on the transport timescale, so we set $S_z = 0$.\n\nApplying these conditions to the continuity equation simplifies it to:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{z} = 0 $$\nFor a radially symmetric system (e.g., averaging over a magnetic flux surface), this equation implies that the total radial particle flow through any closed flux surface is constant. In the absence of a central source (at $r=0$), this constant must be zero. Therefore, the physically relevant steady-state condition is that the net flux-surface averaged radial impurity flux, $\\Gamma_z(r)$, must vanish at every radial position $r$.\n$$ \\Gamma_z(r) = 0 $$\nThe problem states that the radial impurity flux $\\Gamma_z$ can be modeled using a quasilinear spectral representation. The total flux is a linear superposition of contributions from independent Fourier modes, indexed by a wavenumber $k$. The contribution from each mode is assumed to depend linearly on the normalized density gradient, $a/L_{n_z}$, and includes a gradient-independent convective term. The general form of such a linear relationship for the total flux is:\n$$ \\Gamma_z = C \\left[ - D_{z,\\text{tot}} \\left(\\frac{a}{L_{n_{z}}}\\right) + V_{z,\\text{tot}} \\right] $$\nwhere $C$ is a proportionality constant, and $D_{z,\\text{tot}}$ and $V_{z,\\text{tot}}$ are the total transport response coefficients. The minus sign for the gradient-dependent term is a standard convention, ensuring that for a positive coefficient $D_{z,\\text{tot}}$, this term represents an outward flux for a centrally peaked profile (where $a/L_{n_z} > 0$). The term $V_{z,\\text{tot}}$ represents a net convective flux (a \"pinch\" or \"pump-out\").\n\nThe problem provides mode-resolved response coefficients, $D_z(k)$ and $V_z(k)$. The principle of superposition dictates that the total coefficients are the sums of the mode-resolved coefficients:\n$$ D_{z,\\text{tot}} = \\sum_{k} D_z(k) $$\n$$ V_{z,\\text{tot}} = \\sum_{k} V_z(k) $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the flux gives:\n$$ \\Gamma_z = C \\left[ - \\left(\\sum_{k} D_z(k)\\right) \\left(\\frac{a}{L_{n_{z}}}\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{k} V_z(k)\\right) \\right] $$\nNow, we enforce the steady-state zero-flux condition, $\\Gamma_z = 0$:\n$$ 0 = C \\left[ - \\left(\\sum_{k} D_z(k)\\right) \\left(\\frac{a}{L_{n_{z}}}\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{k} V_z(k)\\right) \\right] $$\nAssuming the constant $C$ is non-zero, the term in the brackets must be zero. We can then solve for the steady-state peaking factor $a/L_{n_z}$:\n$$ \\left(\\sum_{k} D_z(k)\\right) \\left(\\frac{a}{L_{n_{z}}}\\right) = \\sum_{k} V_z(k) $$\nThis yields the final expression for the peaking factor:\n$$ \\frac{a}{L_{n_{z}}} = \\frac{\\sum_{k} V_z(k)}{\\sum_{k} D_z(k)} $$\nThis expression represents the steady-state balance where the outward diffusive flux (proportional to the gradient $a/L_{n_z}$) is exactly canceled by the net convective flux.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Peaking Factor**\n\nWe are given a discrete spectrum of modes with their corresponding transport response coefficients $D_z(k)$ and $V_z(k)$. First, we compute the sum of the $D_z(k)$ coefficients:\n$$ \\sum_{k} D_z(k) = 0.20 + 0.35 + 0.50 + 0.45 + 0.30 + 0.15 = 1.95 $$\nNext, we compute the sum of the $V_z(k)$ coefficients:\n$$ \\sum_{k} V_z(k) = 0.040 + 0.070 + 0.085 + 0.060 + 0.040 + 0.020 = 0.315 $$\nNow, we substitute these sums into the derived expression for the peaking factor:\n$$ \\frac{a}{L_{n_{z}}} = \\frac{0.315}{1.95} $$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$ \\frac{a}{L_{n_{z}}} \\approx 0.16153846... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

This enhances the outward neoclassical convection and simultaneously increases the $E \\times B$ shear, which suppresses the inward turbulent transport. Both effects contribute to a larger total outward velocity and a reduced total diffusivity, causing a significant increase in the impurity peaking factor as defined in the problem.",
