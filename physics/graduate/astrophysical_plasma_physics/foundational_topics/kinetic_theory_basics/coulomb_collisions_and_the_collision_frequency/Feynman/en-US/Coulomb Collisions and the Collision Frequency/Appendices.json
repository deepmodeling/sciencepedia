            "problem": "Consider a spatially homogeneous, fully ionized astrophysical plasma consisting of electrons and singly charged ions, with electron mass $m_{e}$, ion mass $m_{i} \\gg m_{e}$, electron number density $n_{e}$, and ion number density $n_{i} = n_{e}$. Assume that the ions are isotropic and stationary on average, with mean ion bulk flow velocity equal to zero, and that the electrons have an initially shifted Maxwellian distribution with a small uniform drift speed $u$ along the $x$-direction. The plasma is weakly coupled, and binary Coulomb collisions are the only source of collisional relaxation; neglect external fields and spatial gradients. Let the electron-ion collision operator be described by the linearized Fokker–Planck form appropriate for Coulomb scattering, and define the electron-ion momentum-transfer collision frequency $\\nu_{ei}$ as the proportionality constant relating the electron-ion collisional drag force to the electron mean drift momentum in the limit $|u| \\ll v_{\\mathrm{th},e}$, where $v_{\\mathrm{th},e} \\equiv \\sqrt{2 k_{B} T_{e}/m_{e}}$ is the electron thermal speed and $T_{e}$ is the electron temperature, with $k_{B}$ the Boltzmann constant.\n\nStarting from the kinetic description and taking appropriate velocity moments, obtain the time evolution of the electron mean drift speed $u(t)$ due to electron-ion Coulomb collisions in the linear (small-$u$) regime.

The use of the Fokker-Planck collision operator, the definition of momentum-transfer collision frequency, and the concept of a momentum relaxation time are all standard and well-established in kinetic theory and plasma physics.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear physical setup and a set of definitions that allow for a unique solution. The initial state is defined (drifting electrons), the physics governing the evolution is specified (Coulomb collisions), and the quantity to be derived is explicitly defined ($\\tau_p$).\n- **Objective:** The problem statement uses precise, standard terminology from plasma physics. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem rooted in fundamental plasma kinetic theory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe evolution of the mean velocity of a particle species in a plasma is governed by the momentum conservation equation, which is obtained by taking the first velocity moment of the kinetic equation (e.g., the Boltzmann or Fokker-Planck equation). For the electron species, the general form of the momentum equation is:\n$$ n_{e} m_{e} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} \\right) = - \\nabla p_{e} + n_{e} \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{ext}} + \\mathbf{R}_{e} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the mean electron velocity, $p_{e}$ is the electron scalar pressure, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{ext}}$ is any external force per particle, and $\\mathbf{R}_{e}$ is the rate of momentum change per unit volume due to collisions.\n\nThe problem states that the plasma is spatially homogeneous, so all spatial gradients are zero. This means $\\nabla p_{e} = 0$ and $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = 0$. The problem also specifies that there are no external fields, so $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{ext}} = 0$. The only collisions considered are between electrons and ions, so the collisional term is the momentum transferred from ions to electrons, $\\mathbf{R}_{e} = \\mathbf{R}_{ei}$. The momentum equation thus simplifies to:\n$$ n_{e} m_{e} \\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt} = \\mathbf{R}_{ei} $$\nHere, $\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}$ since $\\mathbf{u}$ is only a function of time in a homogeneous system. The term $\\mathbf{R}_{ei}$ represents the collisional drag force density exerted by the ions on the electrons.\n\nThe problem provides a definition for the electron-ion momentum-transfer collision frequency, $\\nu_{ei}$, as the proportionality constant relating the drag force to the momentum. In plasma physics, the standard definition for $\\nu_{ei}$ in the limit of small relative drift speed between electrons (mean velocity $\\mathbf{u}_{e}$) and ions (mean velocity $\\mathbf{u}_{i}$) is given by the expression for the drag force density:\n$$ \\mathbf{R}_{ei} = -n_{e} m_{e} \\nu_{ei} (\\mathbf{u}_{e} - \\mathbf{u}_{i}) $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the force opposes the relative motion, acting as a drag. The problem states that the electrons have a mean drift speed $u$ (so $\\mathbf{u}_{e} = \\mathbf{u}$) and the ions are stationary on average ($\\mathbf{u}_{i} = 0$). Substituting these conditions into the standard definition yields:\n$$ \\mathbf{R}_{ei} = -n_{e} m_{e} \\nu_{ei} \\mathbf{u} $$\nThis expression is consistent with the problem's definition of $\\nu_{ei}$. The problem specifies we are in the linear regime $|u| \\ll v_{\\mathrm{th},e}$, where $\\nu_{ei}$ is a constant that depends on background plasma parameters (like $n_e$ and $T_e$) but not on the drift speed $u$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for the drag force density $\\mathbf{R}_{ei}$ into the simplified momentum equation gives:\n$$ n_{e} m_{e} \\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt} = -n_{e} m_{e} \\nu_{ei} \\mathbf{u} $$\nThe common factor of the electron momentum density, $n_{e} m_{e}$, can be cancelled from both sides:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt} = -\\nu_{ei} \\mathbf{u} $$\nThe problem specifies that the drift is one-dimensional along the $x$-direction, so we can write $\\mathbf{u} = u(t) \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. The vector differential equation reduces to a scalar equation for the drift speed $u(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dt} = -\\nu_{ei} u(t) $$\nThis equation describes the time evolution of the electron mean drift speed. It shows that the drift speed decays exponentially with time due to collisions with the stationary ions.\n\nNext, we are asked to find the momentum relaxation time, $\\tau_{p}$, which is defined in the problem statement as:\n$$ \\tau_{p} \\equiv -\\frac{u}{\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)} $$\nWe can substitute our derived expression for the rate of change of the drift speed, $\\frac{du}{dt} = -\\nu_{ei} u$, into this definition:\n$$ \\tau_{p} = -\\frac{u}{(-\\nu_{ei} u)} $$\nAssuming a non-zero drift speed $u \\neq 0$ (otherwise the system is already relaxed and the question is trivial), the term $u$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n$$ \\tau_{p} = \\frac{1}{\\nu_{ei}} $$\nThe result for the momentum relaxation time is the reciprocal of the momentum-transfer collision frequency. This is a fundamental result in kinetic theory for processes dominated by a linear drag force. The problem asks for $\\tau_{p}$ to be expressed in terms of $\\nu_{ei}$ and $u$. The derived expression depends only on $\\nu_{ei}$, which is a valid form of a function of both $\\nu_{ei}$ and $u$ where the dependence on $u$ is trivial (i.e., the function is constant with respect to $u$). This lack of dependence on $u$ is a direct consequence of operating in the linear, small-drift-velocity regime ($|u| \\ll v_{\\mathrm{th},e}$), where the drag force is linear in $u$ and the collision frequency $\\nu_{ei}$ is constant.",
