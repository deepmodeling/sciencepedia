            "solution": "**Derivation of Angular Frequency**\n\nThe motion of a charged particle is governed by the Lorentz force law. The force $\\mathbf{F}$ on a particle with charge $q$ and velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ moving in an electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ and a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nAccording to Newton's second law, this force is equal to the particle's mass $m$ times its acceleration $\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a} = m\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt}\n$$\nThe problem states that there is no electric field, so $\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{0}$. Combining the two laws gives the equation of motion:\n$$\nm\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ can be decomposed into a component parallel to the magnetic field, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel}$, and a component perpendicular to the magnetic field, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation of motion:\n$$\nm\\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}) = q((\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}) \\times \\mathbf{B}) = q(\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel} \\times \\mathbf{B}) + q(\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel}$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{B}$, their cross product is zero: $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{0}$. The equation of motion simplifies to:\n$$\nm\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = q(\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe force vector $\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp} \\times \\mathbf{B})$ is, by the properties of the cross product, perpendicular to both $\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$. Since the force has no component parallel to $\\mathbf{B}$, the acceleration component parallel to $\\mathbf{B}$ is zero:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_{\\parallel} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel}}{dt} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThis implies that $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel}$ is a constant vector. The particle moves with uniform velocity along the magnetic field direction.\n\nThe motion in the plane perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$ is governed by the remaining component of the acceleration, $\\mathbf{a}_{\\perp}$:\n$$\nm\\mathbf{a}_{\\perp} = m\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}}{dt} = q(\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nLet us consider the magnitude of this force. The angle between $\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians. The magnitude of the force is:\n$$\nF = |q(\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp} \\times \\mathbf{B})| = |q| v_{\\perp} B \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = |q| v_{\\perp} B\n$$\nThis force is always perpendicular to the velocity component $\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}$. A force that is always perpendicular to the velocity vector does no work on the particle ($W = \\int \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\int \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} dt = 0$). Consequently, the kinetic energy associated with the perpendicular motion, $\\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\perp}^2$, is constant, which means the perpendicular speed $v_{\\perp}$ is constant.\n\nA particle moving with constant speed under a force of constant magnitude that is always perpendicular to its velocity executes uniform circular motion. The magnetic force provides the necessary centripetal force. The magnitude of the centripetal force required for a particle of mass $m$ moving at speed $v_{\\perp}$ in a circle of radius $r$ is $F_c = \\frac{mv_{\\perp}^2}{r}$.\nEquating the magnetic force to the centripetal force:\n$$\n|q| v_{\\perp} B = \\frac{mv_{\\perp}^2}{r}\n$$\nFor uniform circular motion, the tangential speed $v_{\\perp}$ is related to the angular frequency $\\omega$ (in radians per second) and the radius $r$ by $v_{\\perp} = \\omega r$. We can substitute this relationship into the force balance equation. It is more direct to solve for $\\omega$ without first finding $r$. From the force balance, and given $v_{\\perp} \\neq 0$, we can divide by $v_{\\perp}$:\n$$\n|q| B = \\frac{mv_{\\perp}}{r}\n$$\nSubstituting $v_{\\perp} = \\omega r$:\n$$\n|q| B = \\frac{m(\\omega r)}{r} = m\\omega\n$$\nSolving for the angular frequency $\\omega$, we get:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{|q| B}{m}\n$$\nThis angular frequency is commonly known as the gyrofrequency or cyclotron frequency.\n\n**Minimal Set of Physical Assumptions**\n\nThe validity of this derivation rests on several key assumptions, particularly in an astrophysical context:\n$1$. **Non-relativistic motion**: The derivation utilizes the classical form of Newton's second law, $\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a}$, where $m$ is the constant rest mass. This is valid only when the particle's speed is much less than the speed of light ($v \\ll c$). For thermal particles in the ISM, this is often a good approximation, but for high-energy cosmic rays, a relativistic treatment is required which would modify the result to $\\omega = \\frac{|q| B}{\\gamma m}$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n$2$. **Collisionless regime**: The derivation considers only the Lorentz force and ignores any drag or scattering from collisions with other particles (ions, electrons, neutrals). This assumption holds if the gyroperiod, $T_g = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$, is much shorter than the mean time between collisions. In the tenuous ISM, this condition is frequently met.\n$3$. **Dominance of the Lorentz force**: It is assumed that the Lorentz force is the dominant force acting on the particle. Other forces, such as gravity, are neglected. For elemental particles like electrons and protons, the ratio of the Lorentz force to the gravitational force is enormous in typical astrophysical settings, justifying this neglect.\n$4$. **Uniform and static magnetic field**: The field $\\mathbf{B}$ is assumed to be constant in both space and time on the scales of the particle's gyration. Specifically, the gyroradius $r = \\frac{v_{\\perp}}{\\omega}$ must be much smaller than the magnetic field's spatial scale length ($L_B = |\\mathbf{B}|/|\\nabla \\mathbf{B}|$), and the gyroperiod $T_g$ must be much shorter than the field's temporal scale. When these conditions are met, the concept of a local gyrofrequency is valid, even if the field varies over larger scales.\n$5$. **Negligible radiation damping**: An accelerating charged particle radiates electromagnetic energy (cyclotron radiation for non-relativistic speeds). This energy loss would cause $v_{\\perp}$ to decrease, and the particle would spiral inward. The derivation of a constant $\\omega$ for uniform circular motion implicitly assumes this radiative energy loss is negligible over the timescale of the motion being analyzed. For non-relativistic particles in the ISM, this is an excellent approximation.",

            "solution": "This problem requires the derivation of the gyroradius for a relativistic particle and its subsequent calculation. The analysis will proceed from first principles as requested.\n\nThe motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field is described by the Lorentz force. As no electric field is specified, the force $\\mathbf{F}$ on a particle with charge $q$ and velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ in a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nFor an electron, the charge is $q = -e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. The relativistic equation of motion is $\\mathbf{F} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{p}}{dt}$, where $\\mathbf{p}$ is the relativistic momentum, defined as $\\mathbf{p} = \\gamma m_e \\mathbf{v}$. Here, $m_e$ is the rest mass of the electron and $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor, with $v = |\\mathbf{v}|$ being the particle's speed and $c$ the speed of light.\n\nThe equation of motion is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\gamma m_e \\mathbf{v})}{dt} = -e(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$. Consequently, the work done by the magnetic force on the particle is zero: $dW = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} dt = -e(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v} dt = 0$. Since no work is done, the kinetic energy of the particle, and thus its total energy $E = \\gamma m_e c^2$, remains constant. A constant total energy implies a constant Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ and a constant speed $v$.\n\nWith $\\gamma$ and $m_e$ being constant, the equation of motion simplifies to:\n$$\n\\gamma m_e \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = -e(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt}$ is the acceleration $\\mathbf{a}$. The problem specifies a pitch angle $\\alpha = 90^{\\circ}$, which means the electron's velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is entirely perpendicular to the magnetic field vector $\\mathbf{B}$. In this case, the motion is purely circular. The magnetic force provides the centripetal force required to maintain this circular path.\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force is $F_B = |-e(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})| = e v B \\sin(\\alpha)$. With $\\alpha = 90^{\\circ}$, $\\sin(90^{\\circ}) = 1$, so the force magnitude is $F_B = e v B$.\nThe centripetal force required for a particle of relativistic mass $\\gamma m_e$ to move in a circle of radius $r_g$ (the gyroradius) at speed $v$ is $F_c = (\\gamma m_e) \\frac{v^2}{r_g}$.\n\nEquating the magnetic force and the centripetal force:\n$$\ne v B = \\frac{\\gamma m_e v^2}{r_g}\n$$\nWe can cancel one factor of $v$ (since $v \\neq 0$):\n$$\ne B = \\frac{\\gamma m_e v}{r_g}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the relativistic momentum is $p = |\\mathbf{p}| = \\gamma m_e v$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\ne B = \\frac{p}{r_g}\n$$\nSolving for the gyroradius $r_g$, we obtain the general expression:\n$$\nr_g = \\frac{p}{eB}\n$$\nSince the pitch angle is $90^{\\circ}$, the momentum is entirely in the perpendicular direction, $p = p_{\\perp}$.\n\nNext, we derive how the gyroradius scales with energy in the relativistic regime. We relate the momentum $p$ to the total energy $E$ using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n$$\nE^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2\n$$\nSolving for the momentum magnitude $p$:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2}}{c}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the gyroradius:\n$$\nr_g = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2}}{ecB}\n$$\nThe relativistic regime is characterized by the total energy being much greater than the rest mass energy, i.e., $E \\gg m_e c^2$. In this limit, the $(m_e c^2)^2$ term is negligible compared to the $E^2$ term.\n$$\n\\sqrt{E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = E \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{m_e c^2}{E}\\right)^2} \\approx E\n$$\nThus, in the relativistic regime, the momentum is approximately $p \\approx E/c$. The gyroradius is then approximated by:\n$$\nr_g \\approx \\frac{E/c}{eB} = \\frac{E}{ecB}\n$$\nThis result shows that in the relativistic regime, the gyroradius $r_g$ scales linearly with the total energy $E$: $r_g \\propto E$.\n\nQualitatively, the gyroradius increases with increasing energy for the following reason. The gyroradius represents the radius of curvature of the particle's trajectory. The magnetic force, $F_B = evB$, is the agent that continuously bends the particle's path. The particle's momentum, $p$, can be thought of as its \"inertial stiffness\" or resistance to being deflected. In the ultra-relativistic limit ($E \\gg m_e c^2$), the particle's speed $v$ is already extremely close to the speed of light $c$ and increases very little as energy continues to increase. Therefore, the deflecting force $F_B \\approx ecB$ is nearly independent of energy. However, the momentum $p \\approx E/c$ increases linearly with energy. With a much larger momentum (stiffness) and a nearly constant deflecting force, the particle's trajectory is bent less sharply, resulting in a larger radius of curvature, i.e., a larger gyroradius.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for the gyroradius. We use the full expression for $r_g$ for maximum precision.\n\nThe given parameters and constants in SI units are:\nTotal energy, $E = 10$ GeV $= 10 \\times 10^9$ eV $\\times (1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}$ J/eV$) = 1.602176634\\times 10^{-9}$ J.\nElectron rest energy, $m_e c^2 = 0.51099895$ MeV $= 0.51099895 \\times 10^6$ eV $\\times (1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}$ J/eV$) = 8.187105776 \\times 10^{-14}$ J.\nMagnetic field magnitude, $B = 1$ mG $= 10^{-3}$ G $\\times 10^{-4}$ T/G $= 10^{-7}$ T.\nElementary charge, $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}$ C.\nSpeed of light, $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}$ m s$^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the momentum-energy term, $pc$:\n$$\npc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(1.602176634\\times 10^{-9})^2 - (8.187105776 \\times 10^{-14})^2}\n$$\n$$\npc = \\sqrt{2.566970033 \\times 10^{-18} - 6.70287100 \\times 10^{-27}}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n$$\n$$\npc = \\sqrt{2.566969966 \\times 10^{-18}}\\,\\mathrm{J} = 1.602176632 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n$$\nNow we can calculate the gyroradius:\n$$\nr_g = \\frac{pc}{ecB} = \\frac{1.602176632 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})(2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})(10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{T})}\n$$\n$$\nr_g = \\frac{1.602176632 \\times 10^{-9}}{4.803204713 \\times 10^{-18}}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nr_g = 3.335640946 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in kilometers, rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\nr_g = 3.335640946 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{km}\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get:\n$$\nr_g \\approx 3.336 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{km}\n$$",

The rate at which the magnetic field does work on the particle is given by $P = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$.
