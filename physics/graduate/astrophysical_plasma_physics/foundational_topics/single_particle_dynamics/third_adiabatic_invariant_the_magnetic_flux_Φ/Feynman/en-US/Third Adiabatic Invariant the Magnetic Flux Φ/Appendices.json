            "problem": "A charged particle is trapped within a planetary magnetosphere, which is well-approximated by the magnetic field of a pure dipole with moment $\\vec{\\mathcal{M}}$. The particle executes three distinct periodic motions: a fast gyration about a magnetic field line, an intermediate-speed bounce between magnetic mirror points, and a slow azimuthal drift around the planet. For slow changes to the magnetic field, each of these motions has an associated adiabatic invariant.\n\nWe are interested in the third adiabatic invariant, $\\Phi$, which is associated with the slow drift motion. For a dipole field, this invariant can be defined as the total magnetic flux passing through the region of the equatorial plane external to the particle's drift orbit. The drift orbit, for particles mirroring near the equator, can be approximated as a circle of radius $R$ in the equatorial plane. Thus, the invariant is given by the integral:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\int_R^\\infty B_{eq}(r) (2\\pi r) dr\n$$\nwhere $B_{eq}(r)$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field in the equatorial plane at a radial distance $r$ from the center of the dipole.

            "problem": "Consider an axisymmetric coronal flux rope in an astrophysical plasma, idealized as a thin torus with a nearly uniform axial magnetic field $B(t)$ threading its interior. A single charged particle is magnetically trapped and executes fast gyro-motion and bounce motion, while its guiding center drifts azimuthally around the torus on a closed drift shell of instantaneous major radius $R(t)$, lying in a plane perpendicular to the axial field. Assume a strict hierarchy of timescales: the gyro-period $T_{\\mathrm{gyro}}$, bounce period $T_{\\mathrm{bounce}}$, and drift period $T_{\\mathrm{drift}}$ satisfy $T_{\\mathrm{gyro}}, T_{\\mathrm{bounce}}, T_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\ll \\tau$, where $\\tau$ is the characteristic timescale over which the magnetic configuration is slowly compressed or expanded; and $T_{\\mathrm{coll}} \\gg \\tau$ so that collisions are negligible.

            "solution": "**Part 1: Argument for Conservation of Magnetic Flux ($\\Phi$)**\n\nThe conservation of the third adiabatic invariant $\\Phi$ under these conditions can be argued from the principles of ideal MHD.\n\n1.  **Ideal MHD and Frozen-in Flux:** The problem states the plasma evolution is governed by ideal MHD. A cornerstone of ideal MHD is Alfvén's frozen-in flux theorem, which states that the magnetic flux through any surface that moves with the plasma fluid is perfectly conserved. This theorem is a direct consequence of Faraday's law and the ideal Ohm's law ($\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{plasma}} \\times \\mathbf{B} = 0$), which itself is derived from the Lorentz force in a perfectly conducting medium.\n\n2.  **Drift Shell Motion:** The particle's drift shell is a surface defined by its guiding-center motion. In a slowly evolving, axisymmetric system, the dominant drift that moves the entire shell radially is the $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ drift, caused by the inductive electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ that arises from the changing magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$.\n\n3.  **Equating Velocities:** The bulk plasma velocity perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{plasma}, \\perp}$, is also dominated by the $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ drift. Therefore, under the assumption of slow, ideal evolution, the drift shell moves with the local plasma fluid.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since the drift shell moves with the plasma, the frozen-in flux theorem applies directly to it. The magnetic flux $\\Phi$ enclosed by the drift shell is conserved ($d\\Phi/dt = 0$).\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Final Radius**\n\n1.  **Define the Flux:** The magnetic flux $\\Phi$ is the product of the magnetic field magnitude $B$ and the area $A$ it threads. For a circular drift shell of radius $R$ with a uniform axial field $B$, the area is $A = \\pi R^2$.\n    $$ \\Phi(t) = B(t) \\cdot A(t) = B(t) \\pi R(t)^2 $$\n\n2.  **Apply Flux Conservation:** Since $\\Phi$ is conserved, the initial flux must equal the final flux:\n    $$ \\Phi_i = \\Phi_f $$\n    $$ B_i \\pi R_i^2 = B_f \\pi R_f^2 $$\n\n3.  **Solve for the Final Radius ($R_f$):**\n    $$ R_f^2 = R_i^2 \\frac{B_i}{B_f} $$\n    $$ R_f = R_i \\sqrt{\\frac{B_i}{B_f}} $$\n\n4.  **Substitute Numerical Values:**\n    - $B_{i} = 2.7 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{T}$\n    - $R_{i} = 19.4\\ \\mathrm{Mm}$\n    - $B_{f} = 5.9 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{T}$\n\n    $$ R_f = 19.4 \\ \\mathrm{Mm} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.7 \\times 10^{-3}}{5.9 \\times 10^{-3}}} = 19.4 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.7}{5.9}}\\ \\mathrm{Mm} $$\n    $$ R_f \\approx 19.4 \\times \\sqrt{0.457627} \\ \\mathrm{Mm} $$\n    $$ R_f \\approx 19.4 \\times 0.67648 \\ \\mathrm{Mm} $$\n    $$ R_f \\approx 13.1237 \\ \\mathrm{Mm} $$\n\n5.  **Round to Significant Figures:** Rounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n    $$ R_f \\approx 13.12\\ \\mathrm{Mm} $$",
