This exercise leverages two of the most fundamental invariants—the magnetic moment $\\mu$ and the total energy $W$—to explore how a particle's pitch angle evolves as it moves through varying magnetic and parallel electric fields. Mastering this relationship is key to understanding the ubiquitous phenomenon of magnetic mirroring, which is responsible for trapping particles in astrophysical environments like planetary magnetospheres and in laboratory fusion devices .",

This practice provides a first-principles derivation of the gradient-$B$ drift, a crucial transport mechanism in magnetized plasmas, for a simple, inhomogeneous magnetic field.

            "solution": "The motion of a non-relativistic charged particle with charge $q$ and mass $m$ in a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is governed by the Lorentz force law, where the electric field is absent:\n$$m \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$$\nIn a strong and weakly inhomogeneous magnetic field, the particle's motion can be decomposed into two parts: a rapid gyration around a magnetic field line and a slow drift of the center of this gyration, known as the guiding center. This is the essence of the guiding center approximation. The primary ordering assumption, given in the problem, is that the Larmor (or gyro-) radius, $\\rho = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}}{|q|B}$, is much smaller than the characteristic scale length $L$ over which the magnetic field varies, i.e., $\\epsilon = \\rho/L \\ll 1$. Physically, this means the particle completes many gyro-orbits before it experiences a significant change in the magnetic field strength, allowing for the separation of motion into gyration and drift.\n\nThe first adiabatic invariant, or magnetic moment $\\mu$, is defined as the ratio of the kinetic energy associated with the perpendicular motion, $W_{\\perp}$, to the magnetic field strength $B$:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{W_{\\perp}}{B} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\perp}^2}{B}$$\nFor slow changes in the magnetic field (in space or time), $\\mu$ is approximately conserved. This conservation is a cornerstone of guiding center theory.\n\nA spatial gradient in the magnetic field strength gives rise to a drift. The force on the particle's guiding center due to the magnetic field gradient is given by $\\mathbf{F}_{\\nabla B} = -\\mu \\nabla B$. This force is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. In a strong magnetic field, a perpendicular force $\\mathbf{F}$ does not cause an acceleration in the direction of the force, but rather a drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{F} = \\frac{\\mathbf{F} \\times \\mathbf{B}}{q B^2}$.\n\nApplying this to the gradient-$B$ force, the resulting drift velocity, known as the gradient-$B$ drift, is:\n$$\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} = \\frac{\\mathbf{F}_{\\nabla B} \\times \\mathbf{B}}{q B^2} = \\frac{(-\\mu \\nabla B) \\times \\mathbf{B}}{q B^2} = \\frac{\\mu}{q} \\frac{\\mathbf{B} \\times \\nabla B}{B^2}$$\nWe can substitute the definition of $\\mu$ into this expression:\n$$\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2qB} \\frac{\\mathbf{B} \\times \\nabla B}{B^2} = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2q} \\frac{\\mathbf{B} \\times \\nabla B}{B^3}$$\n\nNow, we apply this general formula to the specific magnetic field given in the problem:\n$$\\mathbf{B}(x) = B_{0}\\left(1+\\frac{x}{L}\\right)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$$\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field is $B(x) = |\\mathbf{B}(x)| = B_{0}\\left(1+\\frac{x}{L}\\right)$, since $B_0 > 0$ and we consider a region where $1+x/L > 0$ for the field not to reverse.

The total velocity of the guiding center, $\\mathbf{v}_{gc}$, is the sum of the velocity component parallel to the magnetic field, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel}$, and all drift velocities.\n$$\\mathbf{v}_{gc} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{R}_{gc}}{dt} = \\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel} + \\sum \\mathbf{v}_{drifts}$$\nIn this problem:\n$1$. The magnetic field lines are straight and parallel to the $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ axis, so $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel} = v_{\\parallel} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The problem does not state $v_{\\parallel}=0$, but its value does not affect the motion in the $x$-$y$ plane.\n$2$. The electric field is zero, so the $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ drift is zero.\n$3$. The magnetic field lines are straight, so there is no curvature drift.\n$4$. The only drift present is the gradient-$B$ drift, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B}$, which we have just calculated.\n\nThe total guiding center velocity is:\n$$\\mathbf{v}_{gc}(x) = \\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B}(x) + \\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel} = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2q L B_0 \\left(1+\\frac{x}{L}\\right)^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + v_{\\parallel} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$$\nLet the position of the guiding center be $\\mathbf{R}_{gc}(t) = x_{gc}(t)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + y_{gc}(t)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + z_{gc}(t)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The components of the guiding center velocity are:\n$$\\frac{dx_{gc}}{dt} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{dy_{gc}}{dt} = v_{\\nabla B,y}(x_{gc})$$\n$$\\frac{dz_{gc}}{dt} = v_{\\parallel}$$\nThe key result for this question is that the velocity component in the $x$-direction is identically zero. This is a fundamental consequence of the drift physics: drift velocities are perpendicular to the forces that cause them. Here, the gradient is in the $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ direction, so the force $\\mathbf{F}_{\\nabla B}$ is in the $-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ direction, and the resulting drift $\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B}$ is in the $\\pm\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ direction, perpendicular to both $\\mathbf{F}_{\\nabla B}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$.\n\nSince $\\frac{dx_{gc}}{dt} = 0$, the $x$-coordinate of the guiding center is a constant of motion. Given that the guiding center is initialized at $x(0) = x_0$, we have $x_{gc}(t) = x_0$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\nThe net displacement in $x$ after a time interval $t$ is defined as $\\Delta x(t) = x_{gc}(t) - x_{gc}(0)$.\nTherefore,\n$$\\Delta x(t) = x_0 - x_0 = 0$$\nThis result holds to the leading order of the guiding center approximation, which is the order at which the drift velocities are derived.",

This allows the decomposition of the particle's velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ into a fast gyromotion $\\mathbf{v}_g$ and a slow drift of the guiding center $\\mathbf{v}_D$. We are concerned with the drifts perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$, so $\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp} = \\mathbf{v}_g + \\mathbf{v}_D$. The equation for the perpendicular drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_D$ in a uniform magnetic field but time-varying electric field can be found by averaging the Lorentz force equation, or more directly by solving for the drift in an iterative manner.\n\nThe equation for the drift component of the motion is:\n$$m \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_D}{dt} = q\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp} + q(\\mathbf{v}_D \\times \\mathbf{B})$$\nThis equation is derived by considering the forces acting on the guiding center.

This is the zeroth-order approximation in an expansion where $\\omega/\\Omega_c \\ll 1$, with $\\Omega_c = qB/m$ being the gyrofrequency.

The lowest-order drift $\\mathbf{v}_E$ is time-dependent, so it has a non-zero acceleration, $\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_E}{dt}$. This acceleration implies an inertial force $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{inertial}} = -m\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_D}{dt}$ on the guiding center. A more direct way is to return to the drift equation and include this acceleration. The total drift $\\mathbf{v}_D$ is the sum of the $\\mathbf{E}\\times\\mathbf{B}$ drift and the polarization drift, $\\mathbf{v}_D = \\mathbf{v}_E + \\mathbf{v}_p$.\nThe full drift equation is $q(\\mathbf{v}_D \\times \\mathbf{B}) = q\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp} - m \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_D}{dt}$.\nSolving for $\\mathbf{v}_D$ as before gives $\\mathbf{v}_D = \\frac{\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp} \\times \\mathbf{B}}{B^2} - \\frac{m}{qB^2} (\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_D}{dt} \\times \\mathbf{B})$.\n$\\mathbf{v}_D = \\mathbf{v}_E - \\frac{m}{qB^2} (\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_D}{dt} \\times \\mathbf{B})$.\nThis is an exact equation. For a slow time variation ($\\omega \\ll \\Omega_c$), we can iterate by substituting the lowest order drift into the small correction term: $\\mathbf{v}_D \\approx \\mathbf{v}_E$. So, $\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_D}{dt} \\approx \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_E}{dt}$.\nThe correction to $\\mathbf{v}_E$ is the polarization drift $\\mathbf{v}_p$:\n$$\\mathbf{v}_p \\approx -\\frac{m}{qB^2} \\left(\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_E}{dt} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right)$$\nWe have $\\mathbf{v}_E = (\\mathbf{E}_{\\perp} \\times \\mathbf{B})/B^2$.

In a spatially varying magnetic field, a particle's guiding center experiences a force. This force, known as the mirror force, acting on the magnetic dipole moment is given by $\\mathbf{F}_{\\nabla B} = -\\mu \\nabla B$. This force, being perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$ (since $\\nabla B$ is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$ for the dominant component), will cause a drift.\nThe drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B}$ due to this force is given by the general formula for force-induced drifts:\n$$\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} = \\frac{\\mathbf{F}_{\\nabla B} \\times \\mathbf{B}}{q B^2} = \\frac{(-\\mu \\nabla B) \\times \\mathbf{B}}{q B^2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mu$:\n$$\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} = \\frac{-\\left(\\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2B}\\right) (\\nabla B \\times \\mathbf{B})}{q B^2} = -\\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2q B^3} (\\nabla B \\times \\mathbf{B})$$\nThe problem states $\\nabla B \\approx (B_0/L)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $\\mathbf{B} \\approx B_0\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The cross product is $(\\nabla B \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\approx ((B_0/L)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) \\times (B_0\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = (B_0^2/L)(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = -(B_0^2/L)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B} \\approx -\\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2q B_0^3} (-(B_0^2/L)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2q B_0 L} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\nThe magnitude of this drift is constant:\n$$|\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B}| = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2q B_0 L}$$\n\n**Calculation of Dimensionless Ratios**\n\nFirst, we find the maximum magnitudes of the time-dependent drifts.\n$\\max_{t}|\\mathbf{v}_{E}(t)| = \\max_{t}|\\!-\\frac{E_0}{B_0} \\cos(\\omega t) \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}| = \\frac{E_0}{B_0}$.\n$\\max_{t}|\\mathbf{v}_{p}(t)| = \\max_{t}|\\!-\\frac{m E_0 \\omega}{q B_0^2} \\sin(\\omega t) \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}| = \\frac{m E_0 \\omega}{q B_0^2}$.\n\nNow we compute the ratios $R_1$ and $R_2$.\n$$R_1 = \\frac{\\max_{t}|\\mathbf{v}_{p}(t)|}{\\max_{t}|\\mathbf{v}_{E}(t)|} = \\frac{\\frac{m E_0 \\omega}{q B_0^2}}{\\frac{E_0}{B_0}} = \\frac{m \\omega}{q B_0}$$\nThis ratio is equivalent to $\\omega / \\Omega_c$, where $\\Omega_c=qB_0/m$ is the proton gyrofrequency.\n\n$$R_2 = \\frac{\\max_{t}|\\mathbf{v}_{p}(t)|}{|\\mathbf{v}_{\\nabla B}|} = \\frac{\\frac{m E_0 \\omega}{q B_0^2}}{\\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2q B_0 L}} = \\frac{m E_0 \\omega}{q B_0^2} \\frac{2q B_0 L}{m v_{\\perp}^2} = \\frac{2 E_0 \\omega L}{B_0 v_{\\perp}^2}$$\n\nWe substitute the given numerical values:\n$m = m_p = 1.6726 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$, $q = e = 1.6022 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$,\n$B_0 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{T}$, $E_0 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V\\,m^{-1}}$, $\\omega = 5.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$,\n$L = 5.0 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $v_{\\perp} = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\n$R_1 = \\frac{(1.6726 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg})(5.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})}{(1.6022 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C})(2.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{T})} = \\frac{8.363 \\times 10^{-29}}{3.2044 \\times 10^{-27}} \\approx 0.026098...$\n$R_1 \\approx 0.0261$.\n\n$R_2 = \\frac{2 (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V\\,m^{-1}}) (5.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) (5.0 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{T}) (5.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})^2} = \\frac{2 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^8)}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-8}) (25 \\times 10^8)} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^5}{50} = 2000$.\nTo three significant figures, $R_2 = 2.00 \\times 10^3$.\n\n**Ordering Assumptions for Guiding Center Approximation**\n\nThe validity of the guiding center approximation and the perturbative derivation of drifts relies on the clear separation of time and length scales.\n1.  **Temporal Ordering**: The characteristic time scale of the electric field variation, $T_E = 1/\\omega$, must be much longer than the gyroperiod, $T_c = 2\\pi/\\Omega_c$. This is equivalent to $\\omega \\ll \\Omega_c$. Our calculated ratio $R_1 = \\omega/\\Omega_c \\approx 0.0261 \\ll 1$ confirms this assumption is well satisfied.\n2.  **Spatial Ordering**: The characteristic length scale of the magnetic field variation, $L$, must be much larger than the particle's Larmor radius, $\\rho_L = v_{\\perp}/\\Omega_c$. Let's compute these values. $\\Omega_c = \\frac{qB_0}{m} \\approx 1.916\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. Then $\\rho_L = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}}{1.916\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\approx 2.61 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{m}$. The ratio $\\rho_L/L = (2.61 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{m})/(5.0 \\times 10^8\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\approx 5.2 \\times 10^{-5} \\ll 1$. This assumption is also well satisfied.\nThe derivations for $\\mathbf{v}_p$ and its comparison to $\\mathbf{v}_E$ are justified by the smallness of $R_1$.",
