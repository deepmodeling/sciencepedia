It is a standard problem in introductory plasma physics. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n***\n\nThe solution begins by deriving the wave equation for an electromagnetic wave in the specified plasma. We start with Maxwell's equations in SI units:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{B}}{\\partial t} \\quad \\text{(Faraday's Law)}\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B} = \\mu_0 \\boldsymbol{J} + \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{E}}{\\partial t} \\quad \\text{(Ampere's Law)}\n$$\nThe plasma current density $\\boldsymbol{J}$ arises from the motion of the electrons, as the ions are assumed to be immobile. Thus, $\\boldsymbol{J} = -n_e e \\boldsymbol{v}_e$, where $n_e$ is the electron number density, $-e$ is the electron charge, and $\\boldsymbol{v}_e$ is the electron fluid velocity.\n\nThe electron fluid velocity is governed by the linearized momentum equation provided:\n$$\nm_{e}\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{v}_{e}}{\\partial t} = -e\\,\\boldsymbol{E}\n$$\nwhere $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n\nWe assume that all time-varying quantities (fields and velocities) have a harmonic time dependence of the form $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$. This allows us to replace the time derivative operator $\\partial/\\partial t$ with the algebraic factor $-i\\omega$. Applying this to the electron momentum equation yields:\n$$\n-i\\omega m_e \\boldsymbol{v}_e = -e \\boldsymbol{E}\n$$\nSolving for the electron velocity $\\boldsymbol{v}_e$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{v}_e = \\frac{e}{-i\\omega m_e} \\boldsymbol{E} = i\\frac{e}{\\omega m_e} \\boldsymbol{E}\n$$\nNow, we can express the current density $\\boldsymbol{J}$ in terms of the electric field $\\boldsymbol{E}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{J} = -n_e e \\boldsymbol{v}_e = -n_e e \\left( i\\frac{e}{\\omega m_e} \\boldsymbol{E} \\right) = -i \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\omega m_e} \\boldsymbol{E}\n$$\nSubstitute this expression for $\\boldsymbol{J}$ into Ampere's Law:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B} = \\mu_0 \\left( -i \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\omega m_e} \\boldsymbol{E} \\right) - i\\omega \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\boldsymbol{E} = -i\\omega \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\omega^2 m_e \\epsilon_0} \\right) \\boldsymbol{E}\n$$\nWe define the electron plasma frequency $\\omega_{pe}$ as:\n$$\n\\omega_{pe}^2 = \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0}\n$$\nUsing this definition, Ampere's law simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B} = -i\\omega \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2} \\right) \\boldsymbol{E}\n$$\nTo obtain a wave equation for $\\boldsymbol{E}$, we take the curl of Faraday's Law:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{E}) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B})\n$$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{E}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{E}) - \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{E}$, and noting that for a transverse wave $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{E} = 0$, the left side becomes $-\\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{E}$. Substituting the expression for $\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B}$ and replacing $\\partial/\\partial t$ with $-i\\omega$:\n$$\n-\\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{E} = -(-i\\omega) \\left[ -i\\omega \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2} \\right) \\boldsymbol{E} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n-\\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{E} = -\\omega^2 \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2} \\right) \\boldsymbol{E}\n$$\nUsing the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0)$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, we arrive at the wave equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{E} + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2} \\right) \\boldsymbol{E} = 0\n$$\nFor a plane wave propagating in the $x$-direction, we assume a solution of the form $\\boldsymbol{E}(x,t) = \\boldsymbol{E}_0 \\exp(i(kx - \\omega t))$. The Laplacian operator becomes $\\nabla^2 \\rightarrow -k^2$, where $k$ is the wavenumber. The wave equation thus yields the dispersion relation for the wave:\n$$\n-k^2 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2} \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\nk^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2 - \\omega_{pe}^2}{c^2}\n$$\n**Condition for Evanescent Penetration**\nWave propagation occurs when $k$ is real, which requires $k^2 > 0$. This happens when $\\omega > \\omega_{pe}$. An evanescent wave is one that does not propagate but decays exponentially in space. This occurs when $k$ is purely imaginary. For $k^2  0$, $k$ will be imaginary. The condition for $k^2  0$ is:\n$$\n\\omega^2 - \\omega_{pe}^2  0 \\implies \\omega^2  \\omega_{pe}^2\n$$\nSince $\\omega$ and $\\omega_{pe}$ are positive frequencies, the condition for evanescent penetration is:\n$$\n\\omega  \\omega_{pe}\n$$\nUnder this condition, we can write the wavenumber as $k = i\\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is a real and positive decay constant. The spatial part of the wave becomes $\\exp(ikx) = \\exp(-\\kappa x)$. Substituting $k=i\\kappa$ into the dispersion relation:\n$$\n(i\\kappa)^2 = -\\kappa^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2 - \\omega_{pe}^2}{c^2} \\implies \\kappa^2 = \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2 - \\omega^2}{c^2}\n$$\nThe characteristic decay length of the field is $1/\\kappa$.\n\n**Electron Skin Depth**\nThe problem defines the electron skin depth, $d_e$, as the characteristic exponential decay length in the limit $\\omega \\rightarrow 0$.\n$$\nd_e = \\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\kappa} = \\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{\\omega_{pe}^2 - \\omega^2}} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{\\omega_{pe}^2}} = \\frac{c}{\\omega_{pe}}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\omega_{pe}$, we get the expression for $d_e$:\n$$\nd_e = c \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e \\epsilon_0}{n_e e^2}}\n$$\n**Numerical Calculation**\nWe are given $n_e = 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$. We use the values of the fundamental constants in SI units:\n-   Speed of light, $c \\approx 2.9979 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n-   Electron mass, $m_e \\approx 9.1094 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n-   Vacuum permittivity, $\\epsilon_0 \\approx 8.8542 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$\n-   Elementary charge, $e \\approx 1.6022 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the electron plasma frequency, $\\omega_{pe}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{pe} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}})(1.6022 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})^2}{(9.1094 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg})(8.8542 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m})}}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{pe} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2.5670 \\times 10^{-23}}{8.0655 \\times 10^{-42}}}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} \\approx \\sqrt{3.1826 \\times 10^{18}}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} \\approx 1.7840 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$\nNow, we compute the electron skin depth $d_e$:\n$$\nd_e = \\frac{c}{\\omega_{pe}} \\approx \\frac{2.9979 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{1.7840 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\approx 0.16804\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $d_e \\approx 0.168\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n**Comparison with Physical Scales**\nThe calculated electron skin depth for this plasma density is $d_e \\approx 0.168\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n1.  **Laboratory Devices**: The typical size range for laboratory plasma devices is given as $0.1\\,\\mathrm{m}$ to $10\\,\\mathrm{m}$. Our calculated skin depth of $0.168\\,\\mathrm{m}$ falls within this range and is comparable to the smaller end of this scale. Therefore, for many laboratory experiments, the plasma size $L$ is comparable to or only moderately larger than the electron skin depth ($L \\gtrsim d_e$). This means that effects related to electron inertia, which operate on the scale of $d_e$, cannot always be neglected and the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approximation ($d_e \\rightarrow 0$) may be invalid. For these devices, their characteristic sizes *approach* the electron skin depth scale.\n2.  **Solar Coronal Loops**: The characteristic widths for solar coronal loops are given as $10^5\\,\\mathrm{m}$ to $10^7\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The electron density in the solar corona is also on the order of $10^{14}-10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, so our choice of $n_e=10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$ is representative. The calculated skin depth $d_e \\approx 0.168\\,\\mathrm{m}$ is many orders of magnitude smaller than these astrophysical structures. For instance, the ratio of the smallest loop width to the skin depth is approximately $(10^5\\,\\mathrm{m})/(0.168\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\approx 6 \\times 10^5$. Therefore, for solar coronal phenomena on these scales, the characteristic sizes *greatly exceed* the electron skin depth ($L \\gg d_e$). In this regime, electron inertia is typically negligible, and physics on the scale of the skin depth is considered microphysical.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed to be a valid, well-posed problem in astrophysical plasma physics. It describes the penetration of a low-frequency electromagnetic disturbance into a magnetized plasma, a classic scenario governed by the physics of Kinetic Alfvén Waves (KAWs).\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the transverse penetration scale, or skin depth $\\delta$, of a shear magnetic perturbation. This scale is set by the non-ideal terms in the generalized Ohm's law that allow the magnetic field to slip relative to the plasma. The problem directs us to consider the balance between the electron inertia and electron pressure-gradient terms.\n\nLet us linearize the provided equations for a perturbation of the form $f_1(x) \\exp(-i\\omega t)$. We assume the spatial variation is predominantly in the $x$-direction, so $\\nabla \\approx \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. The perturbation is a shear magnetic field tangential to the boundary, $\\mathbf{B}_1 = B_{1y}(x,t) \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, which is perpendicular to the background field $\\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n\nFrom Ampère's law in SI units, neglecting the displacement current for low-frequency waves ($\\omega \\ll kc$), we have:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}_1 = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}_1 $$\nFor $\\mathbf{B}_1 = B_{1y}(x) \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, the curl is $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}_1 = -\\frac{\\partial B_{1y}}{\\partial x} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.

When the electron pressure-gradient term dominates over electron inertia, the transverse skin depth increases to the order of the ion sound Larmor radius $\\rho_s$, which can exceed the electron inertial length $d_e$ in high-$\\beta_e$ plasmas.**\nThe dominance of the pressure-gradient term corresponds to the limit $\\rho_s^2 \\gg d_e^2$. In this case, $\\delta^2 \\approx \\rho_s^2$, so the skin depth $\\delta \\approx \\rho_s$. The first part of the statement is correct. The condition $\\rho_s > d_e$ is equivalent to $\\frac{\\rho_s^2}{d_e^2} > 1$, which means $\\frac{\\beta_e}{2} \\frac{m_i}{m_e} > 1$, or $\\beta_e > 2 \\frac{m_e}{m_i}$. Since the mass ratio $m_i/m_e \\gg 1$ (e.g., $\\approx 1836$ for protons), this condition is met for even modest values of $\\beta_e$. For a \"high-$\\beta_e$\" plasma (e.g., $\\beta_e \\ge 1$), the condition is strongly satisfied. Thus, the entire statement is physically sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The skin depth is fixed at the electron inertial length $d_e$ regardless of $\\beta_e$, because electron inertia always dominates the generalized Ohm’s law in collisionless plasmas.**\nThis would be true only if the pressure-gradient term were negligible, i.e., in a cold plasma where $T_e \\to 0$, which implies $\\rho_s \\to 0$ and $\\beta_e \\to 0$. In general, $\\delta$ depends on $\\beta_e$ through $\\rho_s$. The premise that inertia *always* dominates is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. When both electron inertia and pressure-gradient terms are retained, the effective skin depth scales like $\\delta \\sim \\sqrt{d_e^2+\\rho_s^2}$; consequently, $\\delta$ grows with increasing electron temperature and plasma beta.**\nThis statement presents the general formula for the skin depth. The consequences of this formula are then examined. The ion sound Larmor radius squared, $\\rho_s^2$, is directly proportional to the electron temperature $T_e$. The electron plasma beta, $\\beta_e$, is also proportional to $T_e$ (for fixed $n_0, B_0$). Therefore, as $T_e$ or $\\beta_e$ increases, $\\rho_s^2$ increases, and consequently $\\delta = \\sqrt{d_e^2+\\rho_s^2}$ increases. The statement is entirely consistent.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. In the high-$\\beta_e$ limit, thermal motions screen electromagnetic fields on the Debye length, so the skin depth decreases and approaches the Debye length as $\\beta_e$ increases.**\nThis confuses electromagnetic penetration (skin depth) with electrostatic shielding (Debye length, $\\lambda_D$). The skin depth is the characteristic scale for time-varying magnetic fields, while the Debye length is for static electric fields. As shown in A and C, in the high-$\\beta_e$ (high $T_e$) limit, the skin depth *increases* as it becomes dominated by $\\rho_s$, which grows with $\\sqrt{T_e}$. This statement claims the depth *decreases*, which is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The ratio of the pressure-gradient scale to the electron inertial length satisfies $\\rho_s/d_e \\sim \\sqrt{\\gamma_e \\beta_e/2}\\,\\sqrt{m_e/m_i}$, implying that larger $\\beta_e$ suppresses pressure-gradient effects relative to electron inertia.**\nOur calculation for the ratio yielded $\\frac{\\rho_s}{d_e} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_e \\beta_e}{2} \\frac{m_i}{m_e}}$ (re-inserting the general $\\gamma_e$). The option incorrectly uses the ratio $\\sqrt{m_e/m_i}$ instead of $\\sqrt{m_i/m_e}$. This inverts the mass dependence. Furthermore, because the ratio $\\rho_s/d_e$ grows with $\\sqrt{\\beta_e}$, a larger $\\beta_e$ *enhances*, not suppresses, the importance of the pressure-gradient term (associated with $\\rho_s$) relative to the inertial term (associated with $d_e$). The statement is incorrect in both its formula and its conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBoth options A and C are correct statements derived from the standard physical model for this scenario.

            "introduction": "The theoretical length scales we have discussed, such as the electron and ion skin depths, have profound practical implications for computational astrophysics. This exercise puts these concepts into practice by tasking you with designing a numerical simulation strategy for various plasma environments. You will determine the necessary grid resolution and time-stepping scheme to accurately capture multi-scale physics, a fundamental skill for modeling astrophysical phenomena from the solar wind to pair-plasma jets .",

            "problem": "A collisionless, quasi-neutral, cold plasma is modeled as two interpenetrating fluids (electrons and a single ion species) coupled to electromagnetic fields. Starting from the fundamental base consisting of Maxwell’s equations, the Lorentz force law, the electron and ion momentum equations, and the continuity equation, derive the characteristic penetration scale of oscillatory electromagnetic disturbances into the plasma (the skin depth) for electrons and ions. Use a linearized, homogeneous, isotropic, unmagnetized plasma model to identify the relevant natural frequencies and length scales that govern the attenuation of fields and currents. Then, for each specified parameter set, compute the electron skin depth normalized by the macroscopic domain size, $d_e/L$, and the ion skin depth normalized by the macroscopic domain size, $d_i/L$. Design a multi-scale explicit simulation strategy that simultaneously resolves both ion and electron skin-depth phenomena on a single uniform grid and uses multi-rate time integration, with electron and ion updates subcycled relative to a field update constrained by the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition.\n\nYour algorithm must adhere to the following constraints and outputs:\n\n- Spatial resolution requirement: choose a uniform grid spacing $\\Delta x$ that resolves both species’ skin depths by at least the required number of points per skin depth, using\n  - $N_e$ points across the electron skin depth, and\n  - $N_i$ points across the ion skin depth.\n  Compute $\\Delta x$ by enforcing $\\Delta x \\le \\min\\left(d_e/N_e,\\ d_i/N_i\\right)$ and choose $\\Delta x$ equal to this minimum.\n- Domain discretization: for a one-dimensional domain of length $L$, choose the number of cells $N_{\\mathrm{cells}}$ as the smallest integer that satisfies $N_{\\mathrm{cells}} \\ge L/\\Delta x$. Report $N_{\\mathrm{cells}}$ as an integer.\n- Time integration strategy: choose per-species particle update time steps based on characteristic plasma frequencies with a safety factor $\\alpha$, namely $\\Delta t_e = \\alpha/\\omega_{pe}$ and $\\Delta t_i = \\alpha/\\omega_{pi}$, and define the electron-to-ion subcycling factor $S=\\lceil \\Delta t_i/\\Delta t_e \\rceil$ as an integer.

            "solution": "### Theoretical Foundation\n\nWe begin with the linearized equations for a cold, unmagnetized, collisionless, quasi-neutral two-fluid plasma, consisting of electrons and a single ion species. The linearized momentum equation for a fluid species $s$ is $m_s \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_s}{\\partial t} = q_s \\mathbf{E}$. For oscillatory phenomena varying as $e^{-i\\omega t}$, this becomes $\\mathbf{v}_s = \\frac{i q_s}{m_s \\omega} \\mathbf{E}$. The total perturbed current density is $\\mathbf{J} = \\sum_{s} n_{s0} q_s \\mathbf{v}_s$. Substituting for $\\mathbf{v}_s$ gives:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = \\left( \\frac{i}{\\omega} \\sum_{s=e,i} \\frac{n_{s0} q_s^2}{m_s} \\right) \\mathbf{E} $$\nWe define the species plasma frequency, $\\omega_{ps}$, using the SI formula $\\omega_{ps}^2 = \\frac{n_{s0} q_s^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_s}$. The current density is then $\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{i\\varepsilon_0}{\\omega} (\\omega_{pe}^2 + \\omega_{pi}^2) \\mathbf{E}$.\n\nCombining Maxwell's equations $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$ and $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}$ for a plane wave (where $\\nabla \\to i\\mathbf{k}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\to -i\\omega$) and assuming a transverse wave in a quasi-neutral plasma ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} \\approx 0$), we obtain the dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves:\n$$ c^2 k^2 = \\omega^2 - (\\omega_{pe}^2 + \\omega_{pi}^2) $$\nwhere $c = 1/\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0}$. For frequencies below the total plasma frequency, $\\omega^2  (\\omega_{pe}^2 + \\omega_{pi}^2)$, the wavenumber $k$ is imaginary ($k = i\\kappa$), indicating an evanescent wave that decays exponentially with a characteristic penetration scale, or skin depth, of $\\delta = 1/\\kappa$.\n\nThe problem requires using the fundamental skin depths for each species, which are defined as the penetration depth in the static limit ($\\omega \\to 0$) if only that species were mobile.\nThe electron skin depth, $d_e$, is defined as:\n$$ d_e = \\frac{c}{\\omega_{pe}} $$\nAnd the ion skin depth, $d_i$, is:\n$$ d_i = \\frac{c}{\\omega_{pi}} $$\nThe plasma frequencies are calculated using the species' properties:\n$$ \\omega_{pe} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_e e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_e}} $$\nFrom quasi-neutrality, the ion number density is $n_i = n_e / Z$. The ion plasma frequency is:\n$$ \\omega_{pi} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_i (Ze)^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_e/Z) Z^2 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_e Z e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_i}} $$\n\n### Computational Algorithm Design\n\nThe simulation design parameters are derived from these physical scales to ensure the numerical grid and time steps adequately resolve the relevant plasma dynamics. For each test case, the algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate Plasma Frequencies and Skin Depths**: For the given plasma parameters $(n_e, L, Z, m_i)$, compute $\\omega_{pe}$, $\\omega_{pi}$, $d_e = c/\\omega_{pe}$, and $d_i = c/\\omega_{pi}$.\n\n2.  **Compute Normalized Skin Depths**: Calculate the skin depths normalized by the domain size $L$: $d_e/L$ and $d_i/L$.\n\n3.  **Determine Spatial Resolution $\\Delta x$**: The grid spacing $\\Delta x$ must resolve both skin depths according to the specified points per skin depth ($N_e=20$, $N_i=10$). The constraint is chosen as the most restrictive of the two:\n    $$ \\Delta x = \\min\\left(\\frac{d_e}{N_e}, \\frac{d_i}{N_i}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Determine Number of Grid Cells $N_{\\mathrm{cells}}$**: The number of cells is the smallest integer that covers the domain length $L$:\n    $$ N_{\\mathrm{cells}} = \\lceil \\frac{L}{\\Delta x} \\rceil $$\n\n5.  **Determine Time Steps**: The multi-rate time steps are based on the plasma frequencies and the CFL condition, using the safety factor $\\alpha=0.2$ and CFL fraction $\\gamma=0.5$:\n    -   Electron update step: $\\Delta t_e = \\alpha/\\omega_{pe}$\n    -   Ion update step: $\\Delta t_i = \\alpha/\\omega_{pi}$\n    -   Field update step: $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{field}} = \\gamma \\frac{\\Delta x}{c}$\n\n6.  **Calculate Subcycling Factor $S$**: The number of electron updates per ion update is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the ratio of their time steps:\n    $$ S = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\Delta t_i}{\\Delta t_e} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\omega_{pe}}{\\omega_{pi}} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{Z m_e}} \\right\\rceil $$\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the five test cases to generate the required output.",
