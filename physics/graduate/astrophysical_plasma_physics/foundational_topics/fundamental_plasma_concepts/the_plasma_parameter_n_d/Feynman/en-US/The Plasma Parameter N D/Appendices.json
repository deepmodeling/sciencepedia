            "problem": "A long-slit spectroscopic observation of the ionized tail of a planetary nebula yields a locally uniform, fully ionized hydrogen plasma with electron temperature $T_{e} = 8.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and electron density $n_{e} = 50\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. The ion temperature is measured to be $T_{i} = 4.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{K}$. A junior researcher attempts to compute the plasma parameter $N_{D}$ (the number of particles contained in a sphere of radius equal to the Debye length) but makes two common mistakes: they (i) insert the measured density $n_{e}$ in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ directly into a formula constructed in the International System of Units (SI), thereby treating $50\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ as if it were $50\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, and (ii) use the ion temperature $T_{i}$ in place of the electron temperature $T_{e}$ when computing the Debye length. \n\nStarting from fundamental principles appropriate to electrostatic shielding in a plasma, namely Gauss’s law and the Boltzmann relation for electrons in a weak electrostatic potential, and assuming singly ionized hydrogen, derive the scaling of the Debye length with temperature and density, and the consequent scaling of $N_{D}$ with these quantities. Use this to identify how each of the above mistakes propagates into $N_{D}$. Then, for the given observational values, determine the single multiplicative error factor $F \\equiv N_{D}^{\\mathrm{(wrong)}}/N_{D}^{\\mathrm{(correct)}}$ produced by the combination of the two mistakes. Express $F$ as a dimensionless number and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the total multiplicative error factor in the calculation of the plasma parameter $N_D$ due to two specific mistakes. To determine this, we must first derive the scaling of $N_D$ with electron temperature $T_e$ and electron density $n_e$.\n\nWe begin by deriving the expression for the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$, which characterizes the electrostatic screening distance in a plasma. This derivation starts from Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential $\\phi$:\n$$ \\nabla^2\\phi = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the net charge density and $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity. For a fully ionized hydrogen plasma, the charge density is given by $\\rho = e(n_i - n_e)$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, and $n_i$ and $n_e$ are the ion and electron number densities, respectively.\n\nWe consider a plasma that is, on average, electrically neutral, with a background density $n_0$. The ions, being much more massive than electrons, are assumed to form a stationary, uniform background, so we take $n_i \\approx n_0$. The mobile electrons respond to the local potential $\\phi$, and their density is described by the Boltzmann relation:\n$$ n_e = n_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T_e$ is the electron temperature. The plasma approximation requires that the potential energy is small compared to the thermal energy, i.e., $|e\\phi| \\ll k_B T_e$. This allows for the linearization of the exponential term: $\\exp(x) \\approx 1+x$ for small $x$.\n\nSubstituting these into Poisson's equation and linearizing gives:\n$$ \\nabla^2\\phi = -\\frac{e n_0}{\\epsilon_0}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T_e}\\right)\\right) \\approx -\\frac{e n_0}{\\epsilon_0}\\left(1 - \\left(1 + \\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T_e}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e} \\phi $$\nThis equation is known as the screened Poisson equation, which can be written as $\\nabla^2\\phi = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2}\\phi$. By comparison, we identify the square of the inverse Debye length as $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2} = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}$, where we replace the background density $n_0$ with the general symbol for electron density, $n_e$. Thus, the Debye length is:\n$$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}} $$\nFrom this fundamental result, we deduce the scaling of the Debye length: $\\lambda_D \\propto T_e^{1/2} n_e^{-1/2}$.\n\nThe plasma parameter, $N_D$, is defined as the number of electrons within a Debye sphere (a sphere of radius $\\lambda_D$).\n$$ N_D = n_e V_D = n_e \\left(\\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\lambda_D^3\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda_D$ allows us to find the scaling of $N_D$:\n$$ N_D = n_e \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}}\\right)^3 = n_e \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}\\right)^{3/2} $$\n$$ N_D = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\frac{(\\epsilon_0 k_B)^{3/2}}{e^3} \\frac{T_e^{3/2}}{n_e^{1/2}} $$\nThe scaling of the plasma parameter is therefore $N_D \\propto T_e^{3/2} n_e^{-1/2}$.\n\nNow we can analyze the researcher's mistakes. The error factor $F$ is the ratio of the incorrectly calculated value, $N_{D}^{\\mathrm{(wrong)}}$, to the correct value, $N_{D}^{\\mathrm{(correct)}}$.

It is convenient to first take the natural logarithm of $N_D$:\n$$ \\ln N_D = \\ln\\left(\\frac{4\\pi (\\epsilon_0 k_B)^{3/2}}{3e^3}\\right) + \\ln(T^{3/2}) + \\ln(n^{-1/2}) $$\n$$ \\ln N_D = C + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln T - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln n $$\nwhere $C = \\ln\\left(\\frac{4\\pi (\\epsilon_0 k_B)^{3/2}}{3e^3}\\right)$ is a constant. The sensitivities are the partial derivatives of $\\ln N_D$ with respect to $\\ln T$ and $\\ln n$.\nThe sensitivity to temperature is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\ln N_D)}{\\partial (\\ln T)} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\ln T)} \\left(C + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln T - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln n\\right) = \\frac{3}{2} $$\nThe sensitivity to density is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\ln N_D)}{\\partial (\\ln n)} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\ln n)} \\left(C + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln T - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln n\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} $$\nThese are the required closed-form analytic values for the sensitivities.\n\nFinally, we interpret thermodynamic paths in the $(n,T)$ plane. The condition for a contour of constant $N_D$ is $d(\\ln N_D) = 0$.\n$$ d(\\ln N_D) = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln N_D)}{\\partial (\\ln T)} d(\\ln T) + \\frac{\\partial (\\ln N_D)}{\\partial (\\ln n)} d(\\ln n) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{3}{2} d(\\ln T) - \\frac{1}{2} d(\\ln n) = 0 \\implies 3 d(\\ln T) = d(\\ln n) $$\nIntegrating this gives $\\ln n = 3 \\ln T + \\text{const}$, which means contours of constant $N_D$ are paths in the $(n,T)$ plane where $n \\propto T^3$. Any thermodynamic path that does not follow this scaling will cross contours of constant $N_D$, causing $N_D$ to change.\n\nLet's analyze two astrophysically relevant examples:\n1.  **Isothermal Compression**: In this process, the temperature $T$ is held constant while the density $n$ increases. From our expression $N_D \\propto T^{3/2} n^{-1/2}$, with $T=\\text{constant}$, we have $N_D \\propto n^{-1/2}$. As $n$ increases during compression, $N_D$ decreases. The plasma moves to a state of lower $N_D$, becoming less \"ideal\" or more strongly coupled. This occurs, for example, in the slow collapse of an interstellar gas cloud that can efficiently radiate away the heat of compression.\n\n2.  **Adiabatic Compression of a Monatomic Ideal Gas**: For an adiabatic process, $P V^\\gamma = \\text{constant}$. For a monatomic gas, the adiabatic index is $\\gamma = 5/3$. Using the ideal gas law $P = nk_B T$ and the relation $V \\propto 1/n$, the adiabatic condition becomes $(nk_B T) (n^{-1})^{5/3} = \\text{constant}$, which simplifies to $T n^{-2/3} = \\text{constant}$, or $T \\propto n^{2/3}$. We substitute this into the expression for $N_D$:\n    $$ N_D \\propto T^{3/2} n^{-1/2} \\propto (n^{2/3})^{3/2} n^{-1/2} = n^1 n^{-1/2} = n^{1/2} $$\n    During adiabatic compression, $n$ increases, and therefore $N_D$ increases. This process makes the plasma more ideal (increasing $N_D$). An example is the rapid compression in a supernova shock wave, where there is not enough time for the plasma to radiate away its thermal energy.",
