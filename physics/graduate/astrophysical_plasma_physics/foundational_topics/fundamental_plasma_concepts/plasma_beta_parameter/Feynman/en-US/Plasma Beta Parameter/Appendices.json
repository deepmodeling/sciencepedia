Within the single-fluid framework of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the magnetic field contributes to the momentum balance through the Maxwell stress, whose isotropic part can be associated with a magnetic pressure.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained. All provided data and definitions are consistent with the established principles of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and plasma physics. The provided numerical values are physically plausible. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive the dimensionless ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure, known as the plasma beta parameter ($\\beta$), calculate its value for the given conditions, and interpret the result.\n\nFirst, we address the concept of magnetic pressure. In electromagnetism, the energy density $U_B$ stored in a magnetic field with magnitude $B$ in a vacuum (or a medium with permeability close to the vacuum permeability $\\mu_0$) is given by:\n$$\nU_B = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{B^2}{\\mu_0}\n$$\nThe unit of energy density is Joules per cubic meter ($J/m^3$). We can analyze the dimensions to relate this to pressure. A Joule is a Newton-meter ($1\\,J = 1\\,N \\cdot m$), and pressure is defined as force per unit area, measured in Pascals ($1\\,Pa = 1\\,N/m^2$). Therefore, the dimensions of energy density are:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{J}{m^3}\\right] = \\frac{N \\cdot m}{m^3} = \\frac{N}{m^2}\n$$\nThis dimensional equivalence shows that magnetic energy density can be interpreted as a pressure. This quantity is defined as the magnetic pressure, $p_B$:\n$$\np_B = \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}\n$$\nThis expression represents the isotropic part of the magnetic stress, as specified in the problem statement. The full Maxwell stress tensor includes anisotropic terms related to magnetic tension along field lines, but for the purpose of defining a scalar pressure for comparison with the isotropic thermal pressure, $p_B$ is the correct quantity.\n\nNext, we define the dimensionless ratio that compares the thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure. The problem provides the isotropic thermal pressure as $p$. The ratio, denoted by the symbol $\\beta$, is simply the thermal pressure divided by the magnetic pressure:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{\\text{thermal pressure}}{\\text{magnetic pressure}} = \\frac{p}{p_B}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the magnetic pressure $p_B$ into this definition, we obtain the formula for the plasma beta parameter:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{p}{\\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}} = \\frac{2\\mu_0 p}{B^2}\n$$\nThis is the derived dimensionless ratio requested.\n\nWe now proceed to compute the numerical value of $\\beta$ using the values provided in the problem statement:\n- Thermal pressure, $p = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- Magnetic field magnitude, $B = 5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n- Magnetic constant, $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{N\\,A^{-2}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{2 \\times (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{N\\,A^{-2}}) \\times (0.02\\,\\mathrm{Pa})}{(5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{T})^2}\n$$\nTo simplify the calculation, we express all numbers in scientific notation:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{2 \\times (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-2})}{25 \\times 10^{-10}}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{16\\pi \\times 10^{-9}}{25 \\times 10^{-10}}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{16\\pi}{25} \\times 10^{(-9 - (-10))} = \\frac{16\\pi}{25} \\times 10^1 = \\frac{160\\pi}{25}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{32\\pi}{5}\n$$\nUsing the approximate value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265...$, we compute the final numerical value:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{32 \\times 3.14159265}{5} = \\frac{100.5309648}{5} \\approx 20.10619\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be reported to four significant figures. Rounding the value gives:\n$$\n\\beta \\approx 20.11\n$$\nFinally, we must interpret this result. A plasma is classified as \"high-$\\beta$\" if $\\beta > 1$ and \"low-$\\beta$\" if $\\beta < 1$. In this case, $\\beta \\approx 20.11$, which is significantly greater than $1$. Therefore, the plasma is a high-$\\beta$ plasma.\n\nThe implication of a high-$\\beta$ plasma is that the thermal pressure is dominant over the magnetic pressure ($p \\gg p_B$). Consequently, the plasma dynamics are governed primarily by gas-dynamic forces. The magnetic field lines are \"frozen-in\" to the plasma fluid but are too weak to confine or rigidly structure it. Instead, the plasma flow tends to carry, stretch, and distort the magnetic field. The plasma behaves more like an unmagnetized fluid or gas, with the magnetic field playing a secondary role in its overall dynamic evolution.",

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds from first principles as requested.\n\n**1. Total Thermal Pressure ($p$)**\n\nThe problem states that both electrons and ions behave as an ideal gas. For a single species of an ideal gas, the thermal pressure $P$ is given by the ideal gas law, $P = n k_B T$, where $n$ is the number density of the species, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature of the species.\n\nThe plasma consists of electrons and ions (protons, as it is a fully ionized hydrogen plasma). The total thermal pressure $p$ of the plasma is the sum of the partial pressures of the electrons ($p_e$) and the ions ($p_i$), according to Dalton's law of partial pressures.\n\nThe partial pressure of the electrons is:\n$$p_e = n_e k_B T_e$$\n\nThe partial pressure of the ions is:\n$$p_i = n_i k_B T_i$$\n\nThe total thermal pressure $p$ is thus:\n$$p = p_e + p_i = n_e k_B T_e + n_i k_B T_i$$\n\nThe plasma is quasineutral, which implies that the electron number density $n_e$ is equal to the ion number density $n_i$. The problem provides a single value for density, $n$, so we have $n_e = n_i = n$. Substituting this into the expression for total pressure gives:\n$$p = n k_B T_e + n k_B T_i = n k_B (T_e + T_i)$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the total thermal pressure.\n\n**2. Plasma Beta Parameter ($\\beta$)**\n\nThe plasma beta parameter, $\\beta$, is defined by first principles as the ratio of the total thermal pressure $p$ to the magnetic pressure $p_{mag}$.\n$$\\beta = \\frac{p}{p_{mag}}$$\n\nThe magnetic pressure $p_{mag}$ is equivalent to the energy density stored in the magnetic field, which is given by:\n$$p_{mag} = \\frac{B^2}{2 \\mu_0}$$\nwhere $B$ is the magnetic field strength and $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $p$ and $p_{mag}$ into the definition of $\\beta$ yields the final analytical expression for the plasma beta parameter:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{n k_B (T_e + T_i)}{\\frac{B^2}{2 \\mu_0}} = \\frac{2 \\mu_0 n k_B (T_e + T_i)}{B^2}$$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe derived expressions are now evaluated using the provided numerical values:\n- $n = 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n- $T_e = 2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $T_i = 2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $B = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n- $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{N\\,A^{-2}}$\n\n**Evaluation of Total Thermal Pressure ($p$):**\n$$p = (10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K} + 2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K})$$\n$$p = (10^{6}) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{6})\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\n$$p = 4 \\times 1.380649 \\times 10^{6-23+6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\n$$p = 5.522596 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the total thermal pressure is $p \\approx 5.52 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Plasma Beta Parameter ($\\beta$):**\nUsing the full expression for $\\beta$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{2 \\times (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{N\\,A^{-2}}) \\times (10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{T})^2}$$\n$$\\beta = \\frac{2 \\times (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (10^{6}) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{6})}{10^{-6}}$$\n$$\\beta = (32\\pi \\times 1.380649) \\times 10^{-7+6-23+6-(-6)}$$\n$$\\beta = (32\\pi \\times 1.380649) \\times 10^{-12}$$\n$$\\beta \\approx 138.79 \\times 10^{-12} = 1.3879 \\times 10^{-10}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the plasma beta is $\\beta \\approx 1.39 \\times 10^{-10}$.\n\n**4. Commentary on Plasma Regime**\n\nThe computed plasma beta parameter is $\\beta \\approx 1.39 \\times 10^{-10}$. Since $\\beta \\ll 1$, the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure is very small. This indicates that the magnetic pressure is vastly greater than the thermal pressure ($p_{mag} \\gg p$).\n\nTherefore, the plasma is **magnetically dominated**. This type of plasma is often referred to as a \"low-beta\" plasma. In such a regime, the magnetic field governs the dynamics of the plasma. The plasma particles have insufficient thermal energy to significantly alter the magnetic field structure. Instead, the charged particles are constrained to move along the magnetic field lines, a phenomenon described as the plasma being \"frozen\" to the field lines. The overall structure and behavior of the plasma are dictated by the magnetic field configuration.",

The total thermal pressure, $p_{\\mathrm{th}}$, for a fully ionized hydrogen plasma is the sum of the partial pressures of the ions (protons, subscript $i$) and electrons (subscript $e$).

This is due both to the larger inherent fractional uncertainty in $B$ ($\\frac{\\delta B}{B} = 0.20$) and to the fact that its contribution is amplified by a factor of $4$ arising from the $B^2$ term in the denominator of the expression for $\\beta$. Therefore, the uncertainty in the magnetic field measurement dominates the uncertainty in the plasma beta parameter.",
