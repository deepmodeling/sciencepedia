Total Thermal Pressure ($p$)**\n\nThe problem states that both electrons and ions behave as an ideal gas. For a single species of an ideal gas, the thermal pressure $P$ is given by the ideal gas law, $P = n k_B T$, where $n$ is the number density of the species, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature of the species.\n\nThe plasma consists of electrons and ions (protons, as it is a fully ionized hydrogen plasma). The total thermal pressure $p$ of the plasma is the sum of the partial pressures of the electrons ($p_e$) and the ions ($p_i$), according to Dalton's law of partial pressures.\n\nThe partial pressure of the electrons is:\n$$p_e = n_e k_B T_e$$\n\nThe partial pressure of the ions is:\n$$p_i = n_i k_B T_i$$\n\nThe total thermal pressure $p$ is thus:\n$$p = p_e + p_i = n_e k_B T_e + n_i k_B T_i$$\n\nThe plasma is quasineutral, which implies that the electron number density $n_e$ is equal to the ion number density $n_i$. The problem provides a single value for density, $n$, so we have $n_e = n_i = n$. Substituting this into the expression for total pressure gives:\n$$p = n k_B T_e + n k_B T_i = n k_B (T_e + T_i)$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the total thermal pressure.\n\n**2. Plasma Beta Parameter ($\\beta$)**\n\nThe plasma beta parameter, $\\beta$, is defined by first principles as the ratio of the total thermal pressure $p$ to the magnetic pressure $p_{mag}$.\n$$\\beta = \\frac{p}{p_{mag}}$$\n\nThe magnetic pressure $p_{mag}$ is equivalent to the energy density stored in the magnetic field, which is given by:\n$$p_{mag} = \\frac{B^2}{2 \\mu_0}$$\nwhere $B$ is the magnetic field strength and $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $p$ and $p_{mag}$ into the definition of $\\beta$ yields the final analytical expression for the plasma beta parameter:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{n k_B (T_e + T_i)}{\\frac{B^2}{2 \\mu_0}} = \\frac{2 \\mu_0 n k_B (T_e + T_i)}{B^2}$$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe derived expressions are now evaluated using the provided numerical values:\n- $n = 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n- $T_e = 2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $T_i = 2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $B = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n- $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{N\\,A^{-2}}$\n\n**Evaluation of Total Thermal Pressure ($p$):**\n$$p = (10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K} + 2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K})$$\n$$p = (10^{6}) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{6})\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\n$$p = 4 \\times 1.380649 \\times 10^{6-23+6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\n$$p = 5.522596 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the total thermal pressure is $p \\approx 5.52 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Plasma Beta Parameter ($\\beta$):**\nUsing the full expression for $\\beta$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{2 \\times (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{N\\,A^{-2}}) \\times (10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{T})^2}$$\n$$\\beta = \\frac{2 \\times (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (10^{6}) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{6})}{10^{-6}}$$\n$$\\beta = (32\\pi \\times 1.380649) \\times 10^{-7+6-23+6-(-6)}$$\n$$\\beta = (32\\pi \\times 1.380649) \\times 10^{-12}$$\n$$\\beta \\approx 138.79 \\times 10^{-12} = 1.3879 \\times 10^{-10}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the plasma beta is $\\beta \\approx 1.39 \\times 10^{-10}$.\n\n**4. Commentary on Plasma Regime**\n\nThe computed plasma beta parameter is $\\beta \\approx 1.39 \\times 10^{-10}$. Since $\\beta \\ll 1$, the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure is very small. This indicates that the magnetic pressure is vastly greater than the thermal pressure ($p_{mag} \\gg p$).\n\nTherefore, the plasma is **magnetically dominated**. This type of plasma is often referred to as a \"low-beta\" plasma. In such a regime, the magnetic field governs the dynamics of the plasma. The plasma particles have insufficient thermal energy to significantly alter the magnetic field structure. Instead, the charged particles are constrained to move along the magnetic field lines, a phenomenon described as the plasma being \"frozen\" to the field lines. The overall structure and behavior of the plasma are dictated by the magnetic field configuration.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the plasma beta parameter, $\\beta$, its fractional uncertainty, a numerical calculation of this uncertainty, and an identification of the dominant source of error. The derivation must proceed from the foundational principles provided.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the plasma beta parameter, $\\beta$. The total thermal pressure, $p_{\\mathrm{th}}$, for a fully ionized hydrogen plasma is the sum of the partial pressures of the ions (protons, subscript $i$) and electrons (subscript $e$). Using the ideal-gas relation, $p_s = n_s k_B T_s$, for each species $s$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{th}} = p_i + p_e = n_i k_B T_i + n_e k_B T_e$$\nThe problem specifies the assumptions of quasi-neutrality, implying equal number densities ($n_i = n_e$), and thermal equilibrium, implying equal temperatures ($T_i = T_e$). Let us denote the common number density as $n$ and the common temperature as $T$. Substituting these into the expression for thermal pressure yields:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{th}} = n k_B T + n k_B T = 2 n k_B T$$\nThe magnetic pressure, $p_B$, in SI units is given as:\n$$p_B = \\frac{B^2}{2 \\mu_0}$$\nwhere $B$ is the magnetic field magnitude and $\\mu_0$ is the magnetic permeability of free space.\n\nThe plasma beta parameter is defined as the ratio of the total thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{th}}}{p_B}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $p_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $p_B$, we obtain the formula for $\\beta$ in terms of $n$, $T$, and $B$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{2 n k_B T}{B^2 / (2 \\mu_0)} = \\frac{4 \\mu_0 k_B n T}{B^2}$$\n\nNext, we derive the general formula for the fractional uncertainty of $\\beta$, denoted as $\\frac{\\delta \\beta}{\\beta}$. The problem states that the uncertainties in the measured quantities $n$, $T$, and $B$ are small and uncorrelated. For a function $\\beta(n, T, B)$, the square of the total uncertainty, $(\\delta \\beta)^2$, is given by the sum of the squares of the partial uncertainties, added in quadrature:\n$$(\\delta \\beta)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial n} \\delta n\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial T} \\delta T\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial B} \\delta B\\right)^2$$\nTo find the fractional uncertainty, we first compute the partial derivatives of $\\beta$ with respect to each variable:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n} \\left(\\frac{4 \\mu_0 k_B n T}{B^2}\\right) = \\frac{4 \\mu_0 k_B T}{B^2} = \\frac{\\beta}{n}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left(\\frac{4 \\mu_0 k_B n T}{B^2}\\right) = \\frac{4 \\mu_0 k_B n}{B^2} = \\frac{\\beta}{T}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial B} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial B} \\left(4 \\mu_0 k_B n T B^{-2}\\right) = 4 \\mu_0 k_B n T (-2 B^{-3}) = -2 \\frac{4 \\mu_0 k_B n T}{B^3} = -2\\frac{\\beta}{B}$$\nSubstituting these partial derivatives into the uncertainty propagation formula:\n$$(\\delta \\beta)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{n} \\delta n\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{T} \\delta T\\right)^2 + \\left(-2\\frac{\\beta}{B} \\delta B\\right)^2$$\nDividing the entire equation by $\\beta^2$ gives the square of the fractional uncertainty:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\delta \\beta}{\\beta}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\delta n}{n}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\delta T}{T}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{\\delta B}{B}\\right)^2$$\nThis is the general formula for the propagated fractional uncertainty in $\\beta$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the fractional uncertainty using the given data:\n- Fractional uncertainty in number density: $\\frac{\\delta n}{n} = 0.12$\n- Fractional uncertainty in temperature: $\\frac{\\delta T}{T} = 0.08$\n- Fractional uncertainty in magnetic field magnitude: $\\frac{\\delta B}{B} = 0.20$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\delta \\beta}{\\beta}\\right)^2 = (0.12)^2 + (0.08)^2 + 4(0.20)^2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\delta \\beta}{\\beta}\\right)^2 = 0.0144 + 0.0064 + 4(0.0400)$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\delta \\beta}{\\beta}\\right)^2 = 0.0144 + 0.0064 + 0.1600$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\delta \\beta}{\\beta}\\right)^2 = 0.1808$$\nThe propagated fractional uncertainty in $\\beta$ is the square root of this value:\n$$\\frac{\\delta \\beta}{\\beta} = \\sqrt{0.1808} \\approx 0.4252058...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the final numerical result is $0.4252$.\n\nFinally, to identify the measurement that most strongly dominates the uncertainty budget, we compare the individual contributions to the total squared fractional uncertainty:\n- Contribution from $n$: $(\\frac{\\delta n}{n})^2 = (0.12)^2 = 0.0144$\n- Contribution from $T$: $(\\frac{\\delta T}{T})^2 = (0.08)^2 = 0.0064$\n- Contribution from $B$: $4(\\frac{\\delta B}{B})^2 = 4(0.20)^2 = 0.1600$\n\nComparing these values ($0.0144$, $0.0064$, and $0.1600$), the contribution from the magnetic field measurement is overwhelmingly the largest. This is due both to the larger inherent fractional uncertainty in $B$ ($\\frac{\\delta B}{B} = 0.20$) and to the fact that its contribution is amplified by a factor of $4$ arising from the $B^2$ term in the denominator of the expression for $\\beta$. Therefore, the uncertainty in the magnetic field measurement dominates the uncertainty in the plasma beta parameter.",

Beyond $\\beta$, these include $M_s$, $M_A$, $R_m$, and $P_m$. If both plasmas satisfy $R_m \\gg 1$ and $P_m$ is matched (and Reynolds number $Re$ is sufficiently large so that viscous dissipation is negligible at the macroscales in both), the macroscopic flows and fields can follow similar ideal MHD behavior, provided there is strong separation between the system scale $L$ and kinetic microphysical scales.

This option states that macroscopic similarity requires matching $M_s$, $M_A$, $R_m$, and $P_m$, together with strong scale separation $L \\gg \\lambda_D$, $L \\gg \\rho_i$, $L \\gg d_i$. These are the correct dimensionless conditions for ideal MHD similarity and the validity of the fluid description. It also correctly identifies microphysical differences: $\\Omega_{ci}$ changes with $B$, $\\rho_i \\propto \\sqrt{T}/B$, $\\lambda_D \\propto \\sqrt{T/n}$, and collision frequencies and resistivity differ with $n$ and $T$. This is consistent with the derivation above. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This claims identical $\\beta$ alone guarantees identical MHD solutions and identical microphysics. As derived, identical $\\beta$ only fixes the ratio $c_s/v_A$ and does not fix $M_s$, $M_A$, $R_m$, or $P_m$. Microphysical scales depend separately on $B$, $n$, and $T$, so they do not remain identical under variations that preserve $\\beta$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This asserts that equal $\\beta$ and equal $B$ are sufficient for macroscopic similarity and that microphysics are identical except for $\\lambda_D$, claimed to be independent of $B$ and $n$. First, matching $B$ does not guarantee matching $M_s$, $R_m$, or $P_m$, and thus does not ensure macroscopic similarity. Second, $\\lambda_D$ depends on both $T$ and $n$ via $\\lambda_D \\sim \\sqrt{\\epsilon_0 k T/(n e^2)}$, so it is not independent of $n$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This says that matched $\\beta$ and collisionless conditions guarantee macroscopic similarity irrespective of $M_s$ and $M_A$, and that microphysical differences vanish in collisionless plasmas. In collisionless regimes, dissipation mechanisms exist (e.g., Landau and cyclotron damping), and microphysical scales such as $\\rho_i$, $d_i$, and $\\lambda_D$ still matter. Furthermore, differences in $M_s$ and $M_A$ crucially alter macroscopic dynamics (e.g., compressibility and magnetic tension effects). Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. This proposes that matching $v_A$ alone yields macroscopic similarity and that resistivity and the Hall parameter are identical if $\\beta$ is the same. Macroscopic similarity requires matching both $M_A$ and $M_s$ (or equivalently $U$, $c_s$, and $v_A$), as well as $R_m$ and $P_m$. Resistivity depends on $n$ and $T$ via $\\nu_{ei}$ and is not fixed by $\\beta$; the Hall parameter (e.g., $\\omega_{ce}/\\nu_e$) also depends separately on $B$, $n$, and $T$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the unique correct choice that aligns with first-principles reasoning and the dependency of macroscopic and microscopic parameters on $B$, $n$, and $T$ at fixed $\\beta$.",
