In a fully, singly ionized hydrogen plasma, the charge carriers are electrons with charge $-e$ and protons (ions) with charge $+e$. The total charge density is given by $\\rho = e n_{i} - e n_{e}$, where $n_{i}$ and $n_{e}$ are the ion and electron number densities, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that electrons provide the dominant shielding response. This allows us to treat the ions as a stationary, uniform background that ensures charge neutrality in the unperturbed state. Let $n_{0}$ be the number density of both electrons and ions in this unperturbed, uniform state, where $\\phi = 0$.

            "solution": "First, we derive the expression for the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$. We begin with Poisson’s equation for the electrostatic potential $\\phi$:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{\\rho_q}{\\varepsilon_0} $$\nwhere $\\rho_q$ is the net charge density and $\\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

The Fourier transform is:\n$$ \\rho_{\\text{ext}}(\\boldsymbol{k},\\omega) = q \\int d^3r \\int dt \\, \\delta(\\boldsymbol{r} - \\boldsymbol{V}t) e^{-i(\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{r} - \\omega t)} = q \\int dt \\, e^{-i(\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{V}t - \\omega t)} = 2\\pi q \\delta(\\omega - \\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{V}) $$\nThe potential in Fourier space is then:\n$$ \\phi(\\boldsymbol{k},\\omega) = \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{ext}}(\\boldsymbol{k},\\omega)}{\\varepsilon_0 k^2 \\varepsilon(\\boldsymbol{k},\\omega)} = \\frac{2\\pi q}{\\varepsilon_0 k^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k^2 \\lambda_{De}^2} - \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^2}\\right)} \\delta(\\omega - \\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{V}) $$\n\n**Yukawa Potential Limit:**\nFor a stationary charge ($V=0$), the delta function becomes $\\delta(\\omega)$. For immobile ions ($m_i \\to \\infty$), the ion plasma frequency $\\omega_{pi} \\to 0$, so $\\chi_i \\to 0$. The dielectric function reduces to a static one: $\\varepsilon(\\boldsymbol{k}) = 1 + \\frac{1}{k^2\\lambda_{De}^2}$.\nThe source is now $\\rho_{\\text{ext}}(\\boldsymbol{r}) = q\\delta(\\boldsymbol{r})$, with Fourier transform $\\rho_{\\text{ext}}(\\boldsymbol{k}) = q$. Poisson's equation becomes $k^2 \\varepsilon(\\boldsymbol{k}) \\phi(\\boldsymbol{k}) = q/\\varepsilon_0$, so:\n$$ \\phi(\\boldsymbol{k}) = \\frac{q}{\\varepsilon_0 k^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k^2 \\lambda_{De}^2}\\right)} = \\frac{q}{\\varepsilon_0 (k^2 + 1/\\lambda_{De}^2)} $$\nTo find the real-space potential $\\phi(\\boldsymbol{r})$, we perform an inverse Fourier transform:\n$$ \\phi(\\boldsymbol{r}) = \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} \\phi(\\boldsymbol{k}) e^{i\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{r}} = \\frac{q}{\\varepsilon_0 (2\\pi)^3} \\int \\frac{e^{i\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{r}}}{k^2 + \\lambda_{De}^{-2}} d^3k $$\nThis is a standard integral. Using spherical coordinates for $\\boldsymbol{k}$ with the z-axis along $\\boldsymbol{r}$ (so $r=|\\boldsymbol{r}|$), the integral over the angles yields $\\frac{4\\pi \\sin(kr)}{kr}$.\n$$ \\phi(r) = \\frac{q}{\\varepsilon_0 (2\\pi)^2} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2 + \\lambda_{De}^{-2}} \\frac{4\\pi \\sin(kr)}{kr} k^2 dk = \\frac{q}{2\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 r} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{k \\sin(kr)}{k^2 + \\lambda_{De}^{-2}} dk $$\nThe remaining integral evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\exp(-r/\\lambda_{De})$. Thus, the potential is:\n$$ \\phi(r) = \\frac{q}{2\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 r} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} e^{-r/\\lambda_{De}} \\right) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{\\lambda_{De}}\\right) $$\nThis is the Yukawa potential, demonstrating Debye screening by the electrons over the scale length $\\lambda_{De}$.\n\n**Part 2: Wake Analysis and Opening Angle**\n\nTo find the potential in real space for a moving charge, we integrate $\\phi(\\boldsymbol{k},\\omega)$ over all $\\boldsymbol{k}$ and $\\omega$. The $\\delta$-function simplifies the $\\omega$ integration:\n$$ \\phi(\\boldsymbol{r},t) = \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{q}{\\varepsilon_0 k^2 \\varepsilon(\\boldsymbol{k}, \\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{V})} e^{i\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot(\\boldsymbol{r}-\\boldsymbol{V}t)} $$\nIn the frame moving with the charge, let $\\boldsymbol{r}' = \\boldsymbol{r}-\\boldsymbol{V}t$. The potential is stationary:\n$$ \\phi(\\boldsymbol{r}') = \\frac{q}{\\varepsilon_0} \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{e^{i\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{r}'}}{k^2 \\varepsilon(\\boldsymbol{k}, \\omega=\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{V})} $$\nA wake is a coherent structure resulting from the resonant excitation of the plasma's collective modes. This occurs when the denominator $\\varepsilon(\\boldsymbol{k}, \\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{V})$ goes to zero for real $\\boldsymbol{k}$. This condition, $\\varepsilon=0$, defines the dispersion relation of the modes.\n$$ 1 + \\frac{1}{k^2 \\lambda_{De}^2} - \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^2} = 0 \\implies \\omega^2(k) = \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{1 + 1/(k^2\\lambda_{De}^2)} = \\frac{k^2 (\\lambda_{De}^2 \\omega_{pi}^2)}{1+k^2\\lambda_{De}^2} $$\nWe define the ion-acoustic speed $c_s$ such that $c_s^2 = \\lambda_{De}^2 \\omega_{pi}^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_0 e^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_i}\\right) = \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}$. The dispersion relation is then:\n$$ \\omega^2(k) = \\frac{k^2 c_s^2}{1+k^2\\lambda_{De}^2} $$\nA wake is generated if the test charge can resonantly excite these modes. This is a Cherenkov-like process, which requires the particle's speed $V$ to be greater than the phase velocity of the waves, $v_{ph} = \\omega/k$. The maximum phase velocity for ion-acoustic waves occurs at long wavelengths ($k\\to 0$): $\\lim_{k\\to 0} v_{ph}(k) = c_s$. Therefore, a wake is radiated if $V > c_s$, or equivalently, if the Mach number $M = V/c_s > 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the half-opening angle of the wake in the long-wavelength regime, where $k\\lambda_{De} \\ll 1$. In this limit, the dispersion relation is approximately non-dispersive: $\\omega(k) \\approx k c_s$.\nThe resonance condition is $\\omega = \\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{V}$. Let $\\theta$ be the angle between the wavevector $\\boldsymbol{k}$ and the velocity $\\boldsymbol{V}$.\n$$ k c_s \\approx k V \\cos\\theta \\implies \\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{c_s}{V} = \\frac{1}{M} $$\nThis condition determines the direction of the wavevectors of the excited modes. The wake itself is the constructive interference pattern of these waves in real space. The surface of the wake cone is determined by the envelope of the propagating wave fronts. For a particle moving at speed $V$ in a medium supporting waves with phase velocity $v_{ph}$, the half-opening angle of the Cherenkov cone, $\\alpha$, is given by the geometric relation:\n$$ \\sin\\alpha = \\frac{v_{ph}}{V} $$\nIn our long-wavelength case, the relevant phase velocity is $v_{ph} \\approx c_s$. Therefore:\n$$ \\sin\\alpha = \\frac{c_s}{V} = \\frac{1}{M} $$\nThe half-opening angle of the conical wake is thus:\n$$ \\alpha = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{M}\\right) $$\nThis result is valid for supersonic motion ($M>1$) in the long-wavelength limit.",
