            "problem": "Consider a cold, singly ionized, weakly collisional, magnetized electron-proton plasma representative of the warm ionized interstellar medium. A plane electromagnetic wave of angular frequency $\\omega$ propagates parallel to a uniform background magnetic field $B_{\\parallel}$, with electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ transverse to the propagation direction. The electron number density is $n_{e}$, and electron-ion collisions are modeled with a phenomenological collision frequency $\\nu$. Assume ions are stationary on the timescale of the wave, and neglect thermal corrections.\n\nStarting from the electron equation of motion with a drag term and Maxwell's equations for a monochromatic plane wave, derive the dispersion relation for the two circularly polarized normal modes (right-hand and left-hand) that propagate along $B_{\\parallel}$.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, representing a standard derivation in plasma physics. All required constants and parameters are provided.\n\nFirst, we derive the dispersion relation. The equation of motion for an electron in the plasma is given by the Lorentz force with an added phenomenological drag term:\n$$\nm_e \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = -e(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}_{\\parallel}) - m_e \\nu \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nwhere $m_e$ is the electron mass, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the electron velocity, $-e$ is the electron charge, $\\mathbf{E}$ is the wave electric field, $\\mathbf{B}_{\\parallel} = B_{\\parallel}\\hat{z}$ is the background magnetic field, and $\\nu$ is the electron-ion collision frequency. We assume a monochromatic plane wave propagating along the magnetic field, so all wave quantities vary as $\\exp[i(kz - \\omega t)]$. The time derivative becomes $\\frac{d}{dt} \\rightarrow -i\\omega$, so the equation of motion is:\n$$\n-i\\omega m_e \\mathbf{v} = -e(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times B_{\\parallel}\\hat{z}) - m_e \\nu \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n(-i\\omega + \\nu)m_e \\mathbf{v} + eB_{\\parallel}(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\hat{z}) = -e\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nWe introduce circularly polarized components for the transverse fields and velocity: $E_{\\pm} = E_x \\pm iE_y$ and $v_{\\pm} = v_x \\pm iv_y$. The term $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\hat{z}$ in component form is $(v_y, -v_x, 0)$, so its polarized component is $v_y \\mp i v_x = \\mp i(v_x \\pm i v_y) = \\mp i v_{\\pm}$. Substituting this into the vector equation yields two decoupled scalar equations for the circularly polarized modes:\n$$\n(-i\\omega + \\nu)m_e v_{\\pm} \\mp i e B_{\\parallel} v_{\\pm} = -eE_{\\pm}\n$$\nSolving for $v_{\\pm}$:\n$$\nv_{\\pm} = \\frac{-eE_{\\pm}}{m_e(-i\\omega+\\nu) \\mp i eB_{\\parallel}} = \\frac{eE_{\\pm}}{im_e(\\omega+i\\nu \\mp \\omega_{ce})}\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_{ce} = \\frac{eB_{\\parallel}}{m_e}$ is the electron cyclotron frequency. The current density is $\\mathbf{J} = -n_e e \\mathbf{v}$, so its polarized components are $J_{\\pm} = -n_e e v_{\\pm}$. This defines the conductivity for each mode, $\\sigma_{\\pm} = J_{\\pm}/E_{\\pm}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\pm} = \\frac{-n_e e^2}{im_e(\\omega+i\\nu \\mp \\omega_{ce})}\n$$\nThe wave equation from Maxwell's equations for a medium with current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}\\mathbf{E} + i\\omega\\mu_0\\mathbf{J}$. For a transverse plane wave with $\\nabla \\rightarrow i\\mathbf{k}$, this simplifies to $k^2\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}\\mathbf{E} + i\\omega\\mu_0\\mathbf{J}$. For the circularly polarized modes, we have:\n$$\nk_{\\pm}^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} + i\\omega\\mu_0\\sigma_{\\pm}\n$$\nThe complex refractive index is $n_{\\pm} = ck_{\\pm}/\\omega$, so $n_{\\pm}^2 = c^2k_{\\pm}^2/\\omega^2$. Using $\\mu_0\\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$, we get:\n$$\nn_{\\pm}^2 = 1 + \\frac{i\\omega\\mu_0 c^2}{\\omega^2}\\sigma_{\\pm} = 1 + \\frac{i}{\\epsilon_0\\omega}\\sigma_{\\pm}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_{\\pm}$ and the definition of the electron plasma frequency, $\\omega_p^2 = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_e}$:\n$$\nn_{\\pm}^2 = 1 + \\frac{i}{\\epsilon_0\\omega} \\left(\\frac{-n_e e^2}{im_e(\\omega+i\\nu \\mp \\omega_{ce})}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega(\\omega \\mp \\omega_{ce} + i\\nu)}\n$$\nThis is the dispersion relation for the two modes ($+$ for Left-Hand Circularly Polarized, L-mode; $-$ for Right-Hand Circularly Polarized, R-mode).\n\nTo find the imaginary part of $n_{\\pm}$, we first rationalize the denominator:\n$$\nn_{\\pm}^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega} \\frac{(\\omega \\mp \\omega_{ce} - i\\nu)}{(\\omega \\mp \\omega_{ce})^2 + \\nu^2} = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega_p^2(\\omega \\mp \\omega_{ce})}{\\omega [(\\omega \\mp \\omega_{ce})^2 + \\nu^2]}\\right) + i \\left(\\frac{\\omega_p^2\\nu}{\\omega [(\\omega \\mp \\omega_{ce})^2 + \\nu^2]}\\right)\n$$\nLet $n_{\\pm} = \\mathrm{Re}(n_{\\pm}) + i\\mathrm{Im}(n_{\\pm})$. Then $n_{\\pm}^2 = (\\mathrm{Re}(n_{\\pm}))^2 - (\\mathrm{Im}(n_{\\pm}))^2 + 2i\\mathrm{Re}(n_{\\pm})\\mathrm{Im}(n_{\\pm})$.\nFor astrophysical radio propagation, the plasma is tenuous and the frequency is high, so $\\omega \\gg \\omega_p, \\omega_{ce}, \\nu$. This implies that $n_{\\pm}$ is very close to $1$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Re}(n_{\\pm}) \\approx 1$ and $\\mathrm{Im}(n_{\\pm}) \\ll 1$. Equating the imaginary parts of the equation for $n_{\\pm}^2$:\n$$\n2\\mathrm{Re}(n_{\\pm})\\mathrm{Im}(n_{\\pm}) \\approx 2\\mathrm{Im}(n_{\\pm}) = \\frac{\\omega_p^2\\nu}{\\omega [(\\omega \\mp \\omega_{ce})^2 + \\nu^2]}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Im}(n_{\\pm}) \\approx \\frac{\\omega_p^2\\nu}{2\\omega [(\\omega \\mp \\omega_{ce})^2 + \\nu^2]}\n$$\nTo find the leading order expression, we use the hierarchy $\\omega \\gg \\omega_{ce} \\gg \\nu$. The denominator becomes $\\omega [(\\omega \\mp \\omega_{ce})^2 + \\nu^2] \\approx \\omega[\\omega^2(1 \\mp \\omega_{ce}/\\omega)^2] \\approx \\omega^3$.\nTherefore, the leading order expression for the imaginary part is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Im}(n_{\\pm}) \\approx \\frac{\\omega_p^2 \\nu}{2\\omega^3}\n$$\nTo this order, the damping is the same for both modes. The mode with larger damping is the L-mode ($n_+$), as its denominator $(\\omega - \\omega_{ce})^2$ is smaller than the R-mode's $(\\omega + \\omega_{ce})^2$. However, the problem asks to use the derived leading-order expression for the calculation, which does not distinguish between the modes.\n\nWe now evaluate this expression with the given parameters in SI units:\n- $n_e = 0.03~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 3 \\times 10^4~\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $\\omega = 2\\pi \\times 1.4 \\times 10^9~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 8.79646 \\times 10^9~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\nu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Constants: $e = 1.60218 \\times 10^{-19}~\\mathrm{C}$, $m_e = 9.10938 \\times 10^{-31}~\\mathrm{kg}$, $\\epsilon_0 = 8.85419 \\times 10^{-12}~\\mathrm{F/m}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the squared plasma frequency:\n$$\n\\omega_p^2 = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_e} = \\frac{(3 \\times 10^4~\\mathrm{m}^{-3})(1.60218 \\times 10^{-19}~\\mathrm{C})^2}{(8.85419 \\times 10^{-12}~\\mathrm{F/m})(9.10938 \\times 10^{-31}~\\mathrm{kg})} \\approx 9.5453 \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{s}^{-2}\n$$\nNow, calculate the imaginary part of the refractive index:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Im}(n) = \\frac{\\omega_p^2 \\nu}{2\\omega^3} = \\frac{(9.5453 \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{s}^{-2})(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})}{2(8.79646 \\times 10^9~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})^3}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Im}(n) = \\frac{9.5453 \\times 10^1}{2(6.8066 \\times 10^{29})} = \\frac{95.453}{1.36132 \\times 10^{30}} \\approx 7.0121 \\times 10^{-29}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $7.012 \\times 10^{-29}$.\n\nFinally, a brief qualitative comment. The imaginary part of the refractive index, $\\mathrm{Im}(n)$, determines the wave attenuation. The calculated value of $\\mathrm{Im}(n) \\sim 10^{-29}$ is exceedingly small. The optical depth for absorption is $\\tau = \\alpha L = 2 \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\mathrm{Im}(n) L$, where $L$ is the path length. For any plausible astrophysical path length (e.g., kiloparsecs), the optical depth would be extremely small ($\\tau \\ll 1$), meaning collisional damping is completely unobservable.\nThe physical reason for this lies in the relative magnitudes of the characteristic frequencies of the plasma. The strength of collisional damping is proportional to the collision frequency $\\nu$, while the strength of Faraday rotation (the differential rotation of polarization plane) is proportional to the electron cyclotron frequency $\\omega_{ce}$. For the given ISM parameters, $\\omega_{ce} = eB_\\parallel/m_e \\approx 88~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ while $\\nu = 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Since $\\omega_{ce} \\gg \\nu$, the effects of the magnetic field on the electron motion (gyration) are vastly more significant than the effects of collisions. Consequently, Faraday rotation is a prominent, routinely measured phenomenon in radio astronomy, whereas collisional damping at these frequencies is negligible.",

Assume an isotropic relativistic electron distribution and a uniform magnetic field.

            "solution": "The problem is a valid and classic problem in polarized radiative transfer. The derivation proceeds by setting up and solving the differential equations for the Stokes parameters.\n\nFirst, we establish the radiative transfer equations (RTEs) for the Stokes vector components $I(s)$, $Q(s)$, and $U(s)$. The change in each Stokes parameter along a path length element $ds$ is determined by local emission, absorption, and any coupling between parameters.\n\nThe equation for the total intensity $I$ includes emission $\\epsilon_I$ and absorption, characterized by the coefficient $\\alpha$. As there is no dichroism, $I$ is not coupled to $Q$ or $U$. The RTE for $I$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{ds} = \\epsilon_I - \\alpha I(s)\n$$\nThe equations for the linear polarization components $Q$ and $U$ include their respective emissivities ($\\epsilon_Q$, $\\epsilon_U$) and absorption ($\\alpha Q$, $\\alpha U$). Additionally, Faraday rotation induces a coupling between $Q$ and $U$. Faraday rotation is a rotation of the plane of linear polarization by an angle $\\psi$ at a rate $\\frac{d\\psi}{ds} = \\rho_V$. An infinitesimal rotation $d\\psi = \\rho_V ds$ transforms $Q$ and $U$ as $dQ = -2U d\\psi$ and $dU = 2Q d\\psi$. This adds a term $-2\\rho_V U$ to the rate of change of $Q$ and a term $+2\\rho_V Q$ to the rate of change of $U$. The coupled RTEs for $Q$ and $U$ are therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ}{ds} = \\epsilon_Q - \\alpha Q(s) - 2\\rho_V U(s)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{ds} = \\epsilon_U - \\alpha U(s) + 2\\rho_V Q(s)\n$$\nThese three equations form the system of first-order differential equations governing the Stokes vector $\\mathbf{S}(s) = (I(s), Q(s), U(s))$.\n\nTo solve this system, we address the equation for $I(s)$ first. It is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. With the boundary condition $I(0)=0$ and uniform coefficients $\\epsilon_I$ and $\\alpha$, we rearrange the equation as $\\frac{dI}{ds} + \\alpha I = \\epsilon_I$. The solution is found using an integrating factor $\\exp(\\alpha s)$:\n$$\nI(s) e^{\\alpha s} = \\int_0^s \\epsilon_I e^{\\alpha s'} ds' = \\frac{\\epsilon_I}{\\alpha} (e^{\\alpha s} - 1)\n$$\nThus, the solution for the intensity is:\n$$\nI(s) = \\frac{\\epsilon_I}{\\alpha} (1 - e^{-\\alpha s})\n$$\nAt the exit face of the slab, $s=L$, the emergent intensity is:\n$$\nI(L) = \\frac{\\epsilon_I}{\\alpha} (1 - e^{-\\alpha L})\n$$\nNext, we solve the coupled equations for $Q$ and $U$. It is most efficient to use the complex representation $P(s) \\equiv Q(s) + iU(s)$, as defined in the problem. The derivative of $P(s)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{ds} = \\frac{dQ}{ds} + i\\frac{dU}{ds}\n$$\nSubstituting the RTEs for $Q$ and $U$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{ds} = (\\epsilon_Q - \\alpha Q - 2\\rho_V U) + i(\\epsilon_U - \\alpha U + 2\\rho_V Q)\n$$\nWe group terms by their physical origin. The emission terms form the complex emissivity $\\epsilon_P \\equiv \\epsilon_Q + i\\epsilon_U$. The absorption terms form $-\\alpha(Q+iU) = -\\alpha P$. The Faraday rotation terms are $-2\\rho_V U + i(2\\rho_V Q) = 2i\\rho_V(Q + iU) = 2i\\rho_V P$.
