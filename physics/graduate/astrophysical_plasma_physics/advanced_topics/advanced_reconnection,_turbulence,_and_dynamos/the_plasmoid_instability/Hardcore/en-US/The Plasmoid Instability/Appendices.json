            "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional, steady, resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) current sheet of half-thickness $\\delta$ and half-length $L$ embedded in an astrophysical plasma with uniform upstream magnetic field $B_{0}$ and mass density $\\rho_{0}$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the Sweet-Parker scaling for the current sheet half-thickness $\\delta$, the subsequent derivation of the local Lundquist number $S_{\\delta}$ in terms of the global Lundquist number $S$, and a commentary on the physical implications for the plasmoid instability. The derivation proceeds by combining the steady-state resistive MHD induction equation, mass conservation, and energy conservation within the defined current sheet geometry.\n\nWe begin by establishing a coordinate system. Let the current sheet be a two-dimensional structure in the $xy$-plane, centered at the origin. The sheet has a half-length $L$ along the $x$-axis and a half-thickness $\\delta$ along the $y$-axis. The reconnecting magnetic field is primarily in the $x$-direction, with $\\mathbf{B} \\approx B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ for $y > \\delta$ and $\\mathbf{B} \\approx -B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ for $y  -\\delta$. Plasma flows into the sheet from the $\\pm y$ directions with a characteristic speed $v_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and is ejected from the ends of the sheet along the $\\pm x$ directions with a characteristic speed $v_{\\mathrm{out}}$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three main steps.\n\n**1. Steady-State Induction Equation and Ohm's Law**\n\nThe problem provides the resistive MHD induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nIn a steady state ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$), the convective term must balance the resistive diffusion term:\n$$\n-\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to stating that the curl of the steady-state electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is zero ($\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = 0$), where $\\mathbf{E}$ is given by the simplified Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{E} = -(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) + \\eta \\mathbf{J}$. In our $2$D system, this implies a uniform out-of-plane electric field, $E_z$. The balance between convection and diffusion is at the heart of the reconnection process.\n\nWe perform a scaling analysis of this equation within the current sheet. The left-hand side, representing the advection of magnetic flux into the layer, can be approximated. At the edge of the layer ($y \\approx \\delta$), $\\mathbf{v} \\approx v_{\\mathrm{in}} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ and $|\\mathbf{B}| \\approx B_0$. The term $|\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})|$ scales as the magnitude of $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ (which is $v_{\\mathrm{in}} B_{0}$) divided by the characteristic length scale over which it changes, which is the sheet thickness $\\delta$.\n$$\n|\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})| \\sim \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{in}} B_0}{\\delta}\n$$\nThe right-hand side represents the diffusion of the magnetic field. The magnetic field $B_x$ reverses sign over the distance $2\\delta$ in the $y$-direction. We assume that the sheet is thin ($L \\gg \\delta$), so the dominant spatial variation is across the sheet. Thus, the Laplacian $\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$ is dominated by the second derivative in $y$: $\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} \\approx \\frac{\\partial^2 B_x}{\\partial y^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. The scaling of this term is:\n$$\n|\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}| \\sim \\eta \\frac{B_0}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nEquating the magnitudes of the convective and diffusive terms yields the first key relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{in}} B_0}{\\delta} \\sim \\eta \\frac{B_0}{\\delta^2} \\implies v_{\\mathrm{in}} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{\\delta}\n$$\n\n**2. Mass Conservation**\n\nWe apply the principle of mass conservation to the steady flow of plasma through the rectangular control volume defined by the current sheet (of dimensions $2L \\times 2\\delta$). Assuming an incompressible flow with constant density $\\rho_0$, the mass flux entering the top and bottom of the sheet must equal the mass flux exiting the sides.\n$$\n\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{out}}\n$$\nThe inflow area is $2 \\times (2L \\times 1)$ (for a sheet of unit depth), and the outflow area is $2 \\times (2\\delta \\times 1)$. The mass fluxes are:\n$$\n\\rho_0 v_{\\mathrm{in}} (2L) = \\rho_0 v_{\\mathrm{out}} (2\\delta)\n$$\nThis simplifies to our second key relationship, which links the geometry of the sheet to the flow speeds:\n$$\nL v_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\delta v_{\\mathrm{out}} \\implies \\frac{\\delta}{L} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{in}}}{v_{\\mathrm{out}}}\n$$\n\n**3. Energy Conservation and Outflow Speed**\n\nThe final piece of the model comes from considering the acceleration of the plasma. The magnetic energy stored in the upstream field is converted into the kinetic energy of the outflowing plasma jet. The magnetic energy density is $U_B = \\frac{B_0^2}{2\\mu_0}$, and the kinetic energy density of the outflow is $U_K = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0 v_{\\mathrm{out}}^2$. Equating these provides an estimate for the outflow speed:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0 v_{\\mathrm{out}}^2 \\sim \\frac{B_0^2}{2\\mu_0} \\implies v_{\\mathrm{out}}^2 \\sim \\frac{B_0^2}{\\mu_0 \\rho_0}\n$$\nThe term on the right is the square of the Alfvén speed, $V_A \\equiv B_0/\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho_0}$. This gives our third key relationship, which is provided as a guiding approximation in the problem statement:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{out}} \\sim V_A\n$$\n\n**Derivation of $\\delta$ and $S_{\\delta}$**\n\nWe now combine these three scaling relations to find $\\delta$ and then $S_{\\delta}$.\nFrom mass conservation (2) and the outflow speed approximation (3), we can express the inflow speed as:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{in}} = v_{\\mathrm{out}} \\frac{\\delta}{L} \\sim V_A \\frac{\\delta}{L}\n$$\nWe now equate this expression for $v_{\\mathrm{in}}$ with the one derived from the induction equation (1):\n$$\nV_A \\frac{\\delta}{L} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{\\delta}\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta^2$ gives:\n$$\n\\delta^2 \\sim \\frac{\\eta L}{V_A}\n$$\nThis is the Sweet-Parker scaling for the current sheet half-thickness. To express this in terms of the global Lundquist number $S \\equiv LV_A/\\eta$, we rearrange the expression for $\\delta^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta^2}{L^2} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{L V_A} = \\frac{1}{S} \\implies \\frac{\\delta}{L} \\sim S^{-1/2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for an expression for the local Lundquist number, $S_{\\delta} \\equiv \\delta V_A / \\eta$. We can substitute our scaling for $\\delta = L S^{-1/2}$ into this definition. Since we are dealing with scalings, we replace the `~` symbol with equality for the final derivation step.\n$$\nS_{\\delta} = \\frac{\\delta V_A}{\\eta} = \\frac{(L S^{-1/2}) V_A}{\\eta}\n$$\nGrouping the terms, we find:\n$$\nS_{\\delta} = \\left(\\frac{L V_A}{\\eta}\\right) S^{-1/2}\n$$\nRecognizing that the term in parentheses is the definition of the global Lundquist number $S$, we obtain the final relationship:\n$$\nS_{\\delta} = S \\cdot S^{-1/2} = S^{1/2}\n$$\n\n**Physical Implications for Plasmoid Instability**\n\nThe local Lundquist number, $S_{\\delta}$, is the relevant dimensionless parameter for describing the stability of the current sheet to local tearing modes. The tearing instability is a resistive process that grows on the characteristic length scale of the current sheet itself, which is its thickness, $\\delta$. A high value of $S_{\\delta}$ indicates that the sheet is highly magnetized and ideal on its own scale, making it prone to breaking apart.\n\nThe scaling $S_{\\delta} = S^{1/2}$ has profound consequences for reconnection in astrophysical environments, where the global Lundquist number $S$ can be enormous (e.g., $S > 10^{12}$). Classical tearing mode theory (e.g., FKR theory) predicts that a current sheet becomes unstable to tearing when its local Lundquist number exceeds a critical value, typically $S_c \\sim 10^4$. According to the derived scaling, this condition for instability becomes $S^{1/2} > S_c$, or $S > S_c^2 \\sim 10^8$.\n\nSince typical astrophysical Lundquist numbers far exceed this threshold of $\\sim 10^8$, this implies that any large-scale, monolithic Sweet-Parker current sheet is violently unstable. It will fragment into a chain of magnetic islands, or plasmoids. This phenomenon, known as the plasmoid instability, fundamentally alters the reconnection process, leading to a much faster and more chaotic reconnection rate than predicted by the slow Sweet-Parker model. This fast reconnection is necessary to explain explosive astrophysical events like solar flares and stellar flares.",

A quasi-steady reconnection layer of length $L$ and thickness $\\delta$ forms, and the reconnecting field varies across the sheet on the scale $\\delta$. Assume the reconnection layer is a Sweet–Parker current sheet, and the plasmoid instability develops in its linear stage.

            "solution": "The derivation begins by establishing the fundamental relationships for a Sweet–Parker reconnection layer. The analysis will proceed by using scaling relations, denoted by the symbol $\\sim$, as per the problem's instruction to neglect constants of order unity.\n\nFirst, we define the Lundquist number, $S_{L}$, which is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the ratio of the magnetic diffusion time to the Alfvén transit time over a characteristic length scale $L$. For the global system, this is given by:\n$$S_{L} = \\frac{L V_{A}}{\\eta}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the steady-state Sweet–Parker layer. The model is described by two primary balance equations: mass conservation and the steady-state induction equation.\n\n1.  **Mass Conservation**: The mass flux of plasma entering the reconnection layer over its length $L$ must equal the mass flux exiting the layer through its ends. Let $V_{in}$ be the inflow speed and $V_{out}$ be the outflow speed. The mass balance is $\\rho V_{in} L \\sim \\rho V_{out} \\delta$.\n    $$V_{in} L \\sim V_{out} \\delta$$\n    From momentum balance considerations, the plasma is accelerated out of the layer by the magnetic tension of the reconnected field lines, reaching a speed on the order of the inflow Alfvén speed, $V_{out} \\sim V_{A}$. Thus, the mass conservation equation becomes:\n    $$V_{in} L \\sim V_{A} \\delta$$\n\n2.  **Steady-State Induction Equation**: In a steady-state ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$), the resistive MHD induction equation simplifies to a balance between convection and diffusion of the magnetic field at the center of the current sheet. The convective term is $\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$ and the resistive term is $\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$. In scaling terms, this balance is expressed as:\n    $$V_{in} B_{0} \\sim \\eta \\frac{B_{0}}{\\delta}$$\n    Here, the gradient of the magnetic field is taken across the sheet thickness $\\delta$. This simplifies to an expression for the inflow velocity:\n    $$V_{in} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{\\delta}$$\n\nWe now combine these results to find the scaling for the sheet thickness, $\\delta$. Substituting the expression for $V_{in}$ from the induction balance into the mass conservation equation:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\delta}\\right) L \\sim V_{A} \\delta$$\nSolving for $\\delta$ yields the Sweet–Parker sheet thickness:\n$$\\delta^2 \\sim \\frac{\\eta L}{V_{A}}$$\nTo express this in terms of the Lundquist number $S_{L}$, we divide by $L^2$:\n$$\\frac{\\delta^2}{L^2} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{L V_{A}} = \\frac{1}{S_{L}}$$\nThis gives the well-known Sweet–Parker aspect ratio scaling:\n$$\\frac{\\delta}{L} \\sim S_{L}^{-1/2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\delta \\sim L S_{L}^{-1/2}$$\n\nThe problem states that this Sweet–Parker sheet becomes unstable to the plasmoid instability. We use the established \"Loureiro-type\" scaling for the wavenumber $k_{\\max}$ of the fastest-growing linear mode. For a Sweet–Parker configuration, this scaling is:\n$$k_{\\max} \\sim S_{L}^{3/8} \\frac{1}{L}$$\n\nThe number of plasmoids, $N$, that form along the length of the sheet can be estimated as the number of wavelengths of the fastest-growing mode that can fit into the length $L$. The wavelength is $\\lambda_{\\max} = 2\\pi/k_{\\max}$.

We use the Sweet–Parker aspect ratio scaling derived earlier:\n$$\\frac{\\delta}{L} \\sim S_{L}^{-1/2}$$\nWe solve this for $S_{L}$:\n$$S_{L}^{1/2} \\sim \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{L}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{L}{\\delta}$$\n$$S_{L} \\sim \\left(\\frac{L}{\\delta}\\right)^2$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $S_{L}$ into our scaling for $N$:\n$$N \\sim S_{L}^{3/8} \\sim \\left( \\left(\\frac{L}{\\delta}\\right)^2 \\right)^{3/8}$$\nApplying the rules of exponents:\n$$N \\sim \\left(\\frac{L}{\\delta}\\right)^{2 \\times \\frac{3}{8}} = \\left(\\frac{L}{\\delta}\\right)^{\\frac{6}{8}} = \\left(\\frac{L}{\\delta}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{4}}$$\n\nThis result provides the scaling for the number of plasmoids formed during the linear stage of the instability, purely in terms of the geometric properties (length $L$ and thickness $\\delta$) of the underlying Sweet–Parker current sheet, as requested.",

The derivation will proceed in three steps: first, determining $V_{in}$ from the provided empirical scaling; second, deriving the standard expression for $V_{in,SP}$; and third, computing their ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the effective inflow speed $V_{in}$**\n\nIn the upstream region, the plasma is highly conductive and the ideal Ohm's law is applicable. For a steady-state system, Faraday's law, $\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}$, implies $\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = 0$. In a two-dimensional configuration, this means the out-of-plane component of the electric field, which we denote as $E$, is uniform throughout the reconnection domain.\n\nThe ideal Ohm's law is given by $\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = 0$. In the upstream inflow region, the plasma velocity is $\\vec{v} = V_{in} \\hat{y}$ (assuming inflow along the y-direction) and the magnetic field is $\\vec{B} = B \\hat{x}$ (assuming the current sheet lies along the x-axis).

We treat this scaling relation as an equality for the purpose of this derivation:\n$$E = 0.01 B V_A$$\nEquating the two expressions for the electric field $E$:\n$$V_{in} B = 0.01 B V_A$$\nThis yields the effective inflow speed for the plasmoid-mediated case:\n$$V_{in} = 0.01 V_A$$\nThis result shows that the inflow speed in \"fast\" reconnection is a constant fraction of the upstream Alfvén speed, independent of the Lundquist number.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Sweet-Parker inflow speed $V_{in,SP}$**\n\nThe Sweet-Parker model describes a single, elongated current sheet. Its properties are derived by combining mass conservation with the resistive evolution of the magnetic field.\n\nFirst, consider mass conservation. The mass flux into the current sheet must equal the mass flux out of it. The mass inflow rate is given by the density $\\rho$ times the inflow speed $V_{in,SP}$ times the area through which the plasma enters, which is $2L \\times 1$ (for a unit depth in the z-direction). The mass outflow rate is given by the density $\\rho$ times the outflow speed $V_{out}$ times the area through which plasma exits, which is $2\\delta \\times 1$. The outflow speed is approximately the Alfvén speed, $V_{out} \\approx V_A$.\n$$\\rho V_{in,SP} (2L) = \\rho V_{out} (2\\delta) \\approx \\rho V_A (2\\delta)$$\nThis simplifies to a relationship between the aspect ratio of the sheet $(\\delta/L)$ and the normalized inflow speed:\n$$\\frac{V_{in,SP}}{V_A} = \\frac{\\delta}{L}$$\n\nSecond, we analyze the physics inside the diffusion region (the current sheet). Here, magnetic diffusion is balanced by convection. As derived in Step 1, the reconnection electric field is $E = V_{in,SP} B$. Inside the sheet, this electric field must be supported by resistivity. The resistive Ohm's law is $\\vec{E} = \\eta_{res} \\vec{J}$, where $\\eta_{res}$ is the resistivity and $\\vec{J}$ is the current density. Using Ampère's law, $\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\vec{J}$, we can estimate the current density. The magnetic field reverses from $B$ to $-B$ over a distance of $2\\delta$, so $|J| \\approx \\frac{|\\Delta B|}{\\mu_0 |\\Delta y|} \\approx \\frac{2B}{\\mu_0(2\\delta)} = \\frac{B}{\\mu_0 \\delta}$.\nSubstituting this into the resistive Ohm's law gives:\n$$E \\approx \\eta_{res} \\frac{B}{\\mu_0 \\delta}$$\nUsing the given definition of magnetic diffusivity, $\\eta_m = \\eta_{res}/\\mu_0$, we have:\n$$E \\approx \\frac{\\eta_m B}{\\delta}$$\nEquating this with the convective electric field $E=V_{in,SP} B$:\n$$V_{in,SP} B = \\frac{\\eta_m B}{\\delta}$$\n$$V_{in,SP} = \\frac{\\eta_m}{\\delta}$$\nWe now have a system of two equations for the two unknowns, $V_{in,SP}$ and $\\delta$:\n1. $V_{in,SP} = V_A \\frac{\\delta}{L}$\n2. $V_{in,SP} = \\frac{\\eta_m}{\\delta}$\n\nWe can solve for $V_{in,SP}$ by eliminating $\\delta$. From the second equation, $\\delta = \\eta_m / V_{in,SP}$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$V_{in,SP} = V_A \\frac{(\\eta_m / V_{in,SP})}{L}$$\n$$V_{in,SP}^2 = \\frac{V_A \\eta_m}{L}$$\n$$V_{in,SP} = \\sqrt{\\frac{V_A \\eta_m}{L}}$$\nTo express this in terms of the Lundquist number, $S = L V_A / \\eta_m$, we first solve for $\\eta_m$: $\\eta_m = L V_A / S$. Substituting this into the expression for $V_{in,SP}^2$:\n$$V_{in,SP}^2 = \\frac{V_A}{L} \\left( \\frac{L V_A}{S} \\right) = \\frac{V_A^2}{S}$$\nTaking the square root gives the classical Sweet-Parker inflow speed:\n$$V_{in,SP} = \\frac{V_A}{\\sqrt{S}} = V_A S^{-1/2}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of the ratio $R(S)$**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R(S) \\equiv V_{in} / V_{in,SP}$. Using the expressions derived in the previous steps:\n$$V_{in} = 0.01 V_A$$\n$$V_{in,SP} = V_A S^{-1/2}$$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$R(S) = \\frac{0.01 V_A}{V_A S^{-1/2}}$$\n$$R(S) = 0.01 S^{1/2}$$\nThis expression shows how the plasmoid-enhanced reconnection rate compares to the classical Sweet-Parker rate, highlighting the dependency on the Lundquist number $S$.",
