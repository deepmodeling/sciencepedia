A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires us to derive the equilibrium condition for a one-dimensional current sheet. We begin with the fundamental equation for force balance in a plasma in static equilibrium. The steady-state momentum equation for a fluid, neglecting gravity, viscosity, and inertial terms ($\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v}$), is:\n$$\n\\nabla p = \\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nHere, $p$ is the scalar thermal pressure, $\\mathbf{J}$ is the current density, and $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field.\n\nThe problem specifies a one-dimensional system where all quantities vary only with the coordinate $x$. The pressure is $p(x)$, and the magnetic field is given as $\\mathbf{B} = B_{y}(x)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. The pressure gradient is therefore:\n$$\n\\nabla p = \\frac{dp}{dx} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\n\nThe current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is related to the magnetic field by Ampère's law. In a steady state, this is $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}$. For the given magnetic field configuration, we compute the curl:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times (B_{y}(x)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial x} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} - \\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial z} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\nSince the system is one-dimensional with variation only in $x$, the term $\\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial z}$ is zero. Thus, the current density is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} ( \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} ) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\frac{dB_y}{dx} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nThe current flows in the $z$-direction, perpendicular to both the direction of spatial variation ($x$) and the reconnecting magnetic field ($y$).\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $\\nabla p$, $\\mathbf{J}$, and $\\mathbf{B}$ back into the force balance equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\frac{dB_y}{dx} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\right) \\times ( B_y(x) \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} )\n$$\nThe cross product on the right-hand side is evaluated as:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = -\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\nThis gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = - \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} B_y \\frac{dB_y}{dx} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\nEquating the components along $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, we obtain the scalar differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} = - \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} B_y \\frac{dB_y}{dx}\n$$\nThe term on the right-hand side can be expressed as the derivative of the magnetic pressure, $p_B = \\frac{B_y^2}{2\\mu_0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{B_y^2}{2\\mu_0} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu_0} \\left( 2 B_y \\frac{dB_y}{dx} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} B_y \\frac{dB_y}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our force balance equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} = - \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{B_y(x)^2}{2\\mu_0} \\right)\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( p(x) + \\frac{B_y(x)^2}{2\\mu_0} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis is the first required result: the constraint relating the thermal pressure and magnetic field profiles. Integrating this equation with respect to $x$ shows that the sum of the thermal pressure and the magnetic pressure is constant across the current sheet:\n$$\np(x) + \\frac{B_y(x)^2}{2\\mu_0} = \\text{constant}\n$$\nThis represents the principle of total pressure balance in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium.\n\nTo find the value of this constant, we use the given conditions in the upstream region (far from the sheet, at large $|x|$). There, the pressure is $p_{\\mathrm{up}}$ and the magnetic field magnitude is $B_{\\mathrm{up}}$. So, the constant is:\n$$\n\\text{constant} = p_{\\mathrm{up}} + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{up}}^2}{2\\mu_0}\n$$\nTherefore, the pressure balance equation holds for all $x$:\n$$\np(x) + \\frac{B_y(x)^2}{2\\mu_0} = p_{\\mathrm{up}} + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{up}}^2}{2\\mu_0}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the required thermal pressure $p(0)$ at the midplane ($x=0$). We are given that the reconnecting magnetic field component vanishes at the midplane: $B_y(0)=0$. Applying the pressure balance equation at $x=0$:\n$$\np(0) + \\frac{B_y(0)^2}{2\\mu_0} = p_{\\mathrm{up}} + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{up}}^2}{2\\mu_0}\n$$\n$$\np(0) + \\frac{0^2}{2\\mu_0} = p_{\\mathrm{up}} + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{up}}^2}{2\\mu_0}\n$$\nThis yields the expression for the midplane thermal pressure:\n$$\np(0) = p_{\\mathrm{up}} + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{up}}^2}{2\\mu_0}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the magnetic pressure in the upstream region is converted into thermal pressure at the center of the current sheet to maintain equilibrium. This is consistent with a Harris sheet equilibrium, where a peak in plasma density (and thus thermal pressure, assuming constant temperature) exists at the sheet's center to balance the external magnetic field pressure.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values to calculate $p(0)$.\nGiven:\n$B_{\\mathrm{up}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{T}$\n$p_{\\mathrm{up}} = 1.38\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n$\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{H/m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the upstream magnetic pressure:\n$$\n\\frac{B_{\\mathrm{up}}^2}{2\\mu_0} = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{-3})^2}{2(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7})} = \\frac{9.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{8\\pi \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{90}{8\\pi} = \\frac{45}{4\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nNow, we add the upstream thermal pressure:\n$$\np(0) = 1.38 + \\frac{45}{4\\pi}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\np(0) \\approx 1.38 + \\frac{45}{4 \\times 3.14159265...} \\approx 1.38 + 3.581056...\n$$\n$$\np(0) \\approx 4.961056...\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\np(0) \\approx 4.961\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested: deriving the transition criterion, determining the critical Lundquist number $S_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, and computing its numerical value.\n\n#### Part 1: The Transition to Collisionless Reconnection\nIn the framework of resistive MHD, the standard model for slow, steady-state reconnection is the Sweet-Parker model. This model considers a current sheet of full length $2L$ and full thickness $2\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}}$. Plasma flows into the layer at a speed $v_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and is ejected from the ends at a speed $v_{\\mathrm{out}}$.\n\n$1$. **Mass Conservation**: For an incompressible plasma, the mass flux in must equal the mass flux out. Considering a quadrant of the layer, we have:\n$$n_{0} m_{i} v_{\\mathrm{in}} L = n_{0} m_{i} v_{\\mathrm{out}} \\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}}$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{in}} L = v_{\\mathrm{out}} \\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}}$$\n\n$2$. **Outflow Speed**: The outflow is accelerated by the magnetic tension of the reconnected field lines. The outflow speed is thus comparable to the upstream Alfvén speed, $v_{A}$:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{out}} \\approx v_{A} = \\frac{B_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\mu_{0} \\rho_{0}}} = \\frac{B_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\mu_{0} n_{0} m_{i}}}$$\n\n$3$. **Inflow Speed**: The inflow of plasma into the resistive layer is limited by the rate at which the magnetic field can diffuse through the plasma. In steady state, the convective term in the induction equation, $\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$, is balanced by the resistive diffusion term, $\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$. In the layer, this balance can be approximated as:\n$$\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{in}} B_{0}}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}}} \\approx \\frac{\\eta B_{0}}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}}^{2}}$$\nThis yields an expression for the inflow speed:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{in}} \\approx \\frac{\\eta}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}}}$$\n\nCombining these three relations, we can solve for the Sweet-Parker layer thickness, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}}$. Substituting the expressions for $v_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{out}}$ into the mass conservation equation:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}}}\\right) L = v_{A} \\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}}$$\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}}^{2} = \\frac{\\eta L}{v_{A}}$$\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta L}{v_{A}}}$$\n\nThe single-fluid MHD model, upon which the Sweet-Parker model is based, is an approximation that holds for length scales much larger than the intrinsic kinetic scales of the plasma. One of the most important kinetic scales is the ion skin depth, $d_{i} = c/\\omega_{pi}$. The ion skin depth is the characteristic scale at which ions decouple from the electron motion and, therefore, from the magnetic field lines. This decoupling is described by the Hall term in the generalized Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\eta \\mathbf{J} + \\frac{1}{ne}(\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B} - \\nabla p_e)$. The Hall term, $\\frac{\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}}{ne}$, becomes significant when the current sheet thickness becomes comparable to $d_i$.\n\nWhen the Sweet-Parker layer thickness $\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}}$ shrinks to the order of the ion skin depth, i.e., $\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}} \\lesssim d_{i}$, the assumptions of MHD break down. The Hall effect becomes dominant, leading to a much faster reconnection mechanism known as Hall or collisionless reconnection. Therefore, the transition from slow, resistive (Sweet-Parker) reconnection to fast, collisionless reconnection occurs when the resistive layer thickness becomes comparable to the ion skin depth. This validates the premise that the transition occurs at $\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}} \\approx d_{i}$.\n\n#### Part 2: Critical Lundquist Number $S_{\\mathrm{crit}}$\nThe Lundquist number $S$ is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the ratio of the resistive diffusion timescale to the Alfvén transit time. It is defined as:\n$$S = \\frac{L v_{A}}{\\eta}$$\nWe can express the Sweet-Parker thickness $\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}}$ in terms of $S$. From the definition of $S$, we have $\\eta = L v_A / S$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}}$:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(L v_A / S) L}{v_{A}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L^{2}}{S}} = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{S}}$$\nThe critical condition for the transition to collisionless reconnection is $\\delta_{\\mathrm{SP}} = d_{i}$. Let $S_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ be the Lundquist number at which this transition occurs:\n$$\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{S_{\\mathrm{crit}}}} = d_{i}$$\nSolving for $S_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ gives:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\left(\\frac{L}{d_{i}}\\right)^{2}$$\nNow we must express $d_{i}$ in terms of the given parameters ($L$, $n_{0}$) and fundamental constants. The ion skin depth is given by $d_{i} = c/\\omega_{pi}$, where $\\omega_{pi}^{2} = n_{0} e^{2}/(\\epsilon_{0} m_{i})$.\n$$d_{i} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{\\frac{n_{0} e^{2}}{\\epsilon_{0} m_{i}}}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{0} m_{i}}{n_{0} e^{2}}}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $S_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{crit}} = L^{2} \\left(c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{0} m_{i}}{n_{0} e^{2}}}\\right)^{-2} = \\frac{L^{2}}{c^{2}} \\frac{n_{0} e^{2}}{\\epsilon_{0} m_{i}} = \\frac{L^{2} n_{0} e^{2}}{c^{2} \\epsilon_{0} m_{i}}$$\nUsing the relation $c^{2} = 1/(\\mu_{0} \\epsilon_{0})$, which implies $c^{2} \\epsilon_{0} = 1/\\mu_{0}$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{L^{2} n_{0} e^{2}}{(1/\\mu_{0}) m_{i}} = \\frac{\\mu_{0} e^{2} n_{0} L^{2}}{m_{i}}$$\nFor a fully ionized hydrogen plasma, $m_{i} = m_{p}$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{\\mu_{0} e^{2} n_{0} L^{2}}{m_{p}}$$\n\n#### Part 3: Numerical Calculation of $S_{\\mathrm{crit}}$\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $L = 1.00 \\times 10^{7}~\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $n_{0} = 1.00 \\times 10^{15}~\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n-   $m_{p} = 1.67262192369 \\times 10^{-27}~\\mathrm{kg}$\n-   $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}~\\mathrm{C}$\n-   $\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{H}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $S_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{H}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}~\\mathrm{C})^{2} (1.00 \\times 10^{15}~\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) (1.00 \\times 10^{7}~\\mathrm{m})^{2}}{1.67262192369 \\times 10^{-27}~\\mathrm{kg}}$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (2.56696996... \\times 10^{-38}) (1.00 \\times 10^{15}) (1.00 \\times 10^{14})}{1.67262192369 \\times 10^{-27}}$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{(3.22576... \\times 10^{-15})}{1.67262192369 \\times 10^{-27}}$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 1.92850... \\times 10^{12}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 1.93 \\times 10^{12}$$",

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is computed in three main steps: 1. Determine the reconnection electric field $E_{\\mathrm{rec}}$. 2. Calculate the upstream Alfvén speed $V_A$. 3. Compute the dimensionless ratio $R$. All calculations will be performed in SI units.\n\nFirst, we express all given vector quantities in SI units.\nThe electric field:\n$\\mathbf{E} = (-0.2 \\times 10^{-3},\\, 0.4 \\times 10^{-3},\\, 1.5 \\times 10^{-3})\\,\\mathrm{V/m}$.\nThe magnetic field:\n$\\mathbf{B} = (20 \\times 10^{-9},\\, 5 \\times 10^{-9},\\, 0)\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\nThe X-line velocity:\n$\\mathbf{u}_{X} = (200 \\times 10^{3},\\, 20 \\times 10^{3},\\, 0)\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the reconnection electric field $E_{\\mathrm{rec}}$**\nThe electric field $\\mathbf{E}'$ in the rest frame of the X-line is given by the non-relativistic Lorentz transformation:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}' = \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u}_{X} \\times \\mathbf{B} $$\nThe problem defines the reconnection electric field $E_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ as the component of $\\mathbf{E}'$ in the out-of-plane direction, $E'_{\\mathrm{M}}$. We need to compute the M-component of the cross product $\\mathbf{u}_{X} \\times \\mathbf{B}$:\n$$ (\\mathbf{u}_{X} \\times \\mathbf{B})_{M} = u_{XL} B_{N} - u_{XN} B_{L} $$\nSubstituting the values in SI units:\n$$ (\\mathbf{u}_{X} \\times \\mathbf{B})_{M} = (200 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{m/s})(5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{T}) - (20 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{m/s})(20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{T}) $$\n$$ (\\mathbf{u}_{X} \\times \\mathbf{B})_{M} = (1000 \\times 10^{-6} - 400 \\times 10^{-6})\\,\\mathrm{V/m} = 600 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{V/m} = 0.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V/m} $$\nNow, we find $E_{\\mathrm{rec}} = E'_{M}$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{rec}} = E_{M} + (\\mathbf{u}_{X} \\times \\mathbf{B})_{M} $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{rec}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V/m} + 0.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V/m} = 2.1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V/m} $$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the upstream Alfvén speed $V_A$**\nThe Alfvén speed is defined as $V_{A} = \\frac{B_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\mu_{0} \\rho}}$, where $\\rho$ is the upstream mass density. The mass density is $\\rho = n_{i} m_{i}$.\nFirst, convert the ion number density $n_i$ to SI units (m$^{-3}$):\n$$ n_{i} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 0.2 \\times (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{-3} = 0.2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}} $$\nThe mass density $\\rho$ is calculated using the proton mass $m_p \\approx 1.6726 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$:\n$$ \\rho = n_{i} m_{p} = (0.2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}})(1.6726 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 0.33452 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}} $$\nThe upstream magnetic field is $B_{0} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nT} = 20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{T}$, and the permeability of free space is $\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m / A}$.\nNow we can compute $V_A$:\n$$ V_{A} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{T}}{\\sqrt{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m / A})(0.33452 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}})}} $$\n$$ V_{A} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^{-9}}{\\sqrt{4.2037 \\times 10^{-28}}}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} \\approx \\frac{20 \\times 10^{-9}}{2.0503 \\times 10^{-14}}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 9.7547 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} $$\n\n**Step 3: Compute the dimensionless ratio $R$**\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as:\n$$ R = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{0.1\\, B_{0}\\, V_{A}} $$\nFirst, we compute the denominator:\n$$ 0.1\\, B_{0}\\, V_{A} = 0.1 \\times (20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{T}) \\times (9.7547 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) $$\n$$ 0.1\\, B_{0}\\, V_{A} = 1.95094 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V/m} $$\nNow we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{2.1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V/m}}{1.95094 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V/m}} \\approx 1.07640 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives:\n$$ R \\approx 1.08 $$\nThe quantity $E_{\\mathrm{rec}} / (B_0 V_A)$ represents the dimensionless reconnection rate. A value of approximately $0.1$ is typical for fast, collisionless reconnection, which corresponds to our calculated $R \\approx 1$.",
