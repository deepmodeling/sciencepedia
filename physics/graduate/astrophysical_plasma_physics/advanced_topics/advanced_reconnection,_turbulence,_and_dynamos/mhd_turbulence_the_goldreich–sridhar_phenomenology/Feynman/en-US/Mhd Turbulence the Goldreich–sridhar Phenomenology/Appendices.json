Express the final result for $\\mathrm{Re}_{\\parallel,d}$ in terms of $v_A$, $u_L$, and $\\mathrm{Re}_L$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the Goldreich–Sridhar model, a cornerstone of modern MHD turbulence theory. All concepts ($v_A$, $\\mathrm{Re}_L$, critical balance) are standard in plasma physics. The problem is firmly grounded in established scientific principles.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a complete set of assumptions and definitions needed to derive a unique solution. The objective is clearly stated.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise and quantitative. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n-   **No other flaws detected**: The problem is not non-formalizable, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable. It is a standard derivation problem in theoretical astrophysics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is derived by following the logic of the Goldreich-Sridhar (GS95) phenomenology as outlined in the problem statement. The proportionality symbol `$\\sim$` will be used throughout the derivation, as the problem is formulated in terms of scaling relations. Proportionality constants of order unity are ignored.\n\nFirst, we establish the scaling of the velocity fluctuations $\\delta u_l$ with the perpendicular scale $l_{\\perp}$. The assumption of a constant energy flux $\\epsilon$ across scales implies that the rate of energy transfer at any scale $l$ is constant. This rate is the energy per unit mass at that scale, $\\sim (\\delta u_l)^2$, divided by the nonlinear interaction time (eddy turnover time), $t_{\\mathrm{nl}} \\sim l_{\\perp}/\\delta u_l$.\n$$\n\\epsilon \\sim \\frac{(\\delta u_l)^2}{t_{\\mathrm{nl}}} \\sim \\frac{(\\delta u_l)^3}{l_{\\perp}}\n$$\nThis flux is constant throughout the inertial range, so it must be equal to the energy injection rate at the outer scale $L$.\n$$\n\\epsilon \\sim \\frac{u_L^3}{L}\n$$\nEquating the expressions for $\\epsilon$ gives the scaling for $\\delta u_l$:\n$$\n\\frac{(\\delta u_l)^3}{l_{\\perp}} \\sim \\frac{u_L^3}{L} \\implies \\delta u_l \\sim u_L \\left( \\frac{l_{\\perp}}{L} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n\nSecond, we use the critical balance condition, which states that the linear wave propagation time along the local magnetic field is comparable to the nonlinear interaction time, $t_A \\sim t_{\\mathrm{nl}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{l_{\\parallel}}{v_A} \\sim \\frac{l_{\\perp}}{\\delta u_l}\n$$\nSubstituting the scaling for $\\delta u_l$ into the critical balance equation, we find the anisotropic scaling relation between the parallel and perpendicular scales:\n$$\nl_{\\parallel} \\sim \\frac{v_A l_{\\perp}}{\\delta u_l} \\sim \\frac{v_A l_{\\perp}}{u_L (l_{\\perp}/L)^{1/3}} = \\frac{v_A}{u_L} L^{1/3} l_{\\perp}^{2/3}\n$$\nThis relation describes the scale-dependent anisotropy of turbulent eddies in the GS95 picture.\n\nThird, we determine the dissipation scale. The inertial-range cascade terminates at the dissipation scale, where the nonlinear interaction time becomes comparable to the viscous dissipation time, $t_{\\mathrm{nl}} \\sim t_{\\nu}$. The problem provides the viscous time as $t_{\\nu} \\sim l_{\\perp}^{2}/\\nu$. We denote the perpendicular dissipation scale by $l_{\\perp,d}$ and the velocity increment at this scale by $\\delta u_d$.\n$$\n\\frac{l_{\\perp,d}}{\\delta u_d} \\sim \\frac{l_{\\perp,d}^2}{\\nu} \\implies \\delta u_d \\sim \\frac{\\nu}{l_{\\perp,d}}\n$$\n\nNow we have two expressions for $\\delta u_d$: one from the inertial-range cascade and one from the dissipation condition. Equating them allows us to solve for $l_{\\perp,d}$:\n$$\nu_L \\left( \\frac{l_{\\perp,d}}{L} \\right)^{1/3} \\sim \\frac{\\nu}{l_{\\perp,d}}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $l_{\\perp,d}$:\n$$\nl_{\\perp,d}^{4/3} \\sim \\frac{\\nu L^{1/3}}{u_L} \\implies l_{\\perp,d} \\sim \\left( \\frac{\\nu}{u_L} \\right)^{3/4} L^{1/4}\n$$\nWe express this in terms of the outer-scale Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re}_L = u_L L / \\nu$, which implies $\\nu = u_L L / \\mathrm{Re}_L$.\n$$\nl_{\\perp,d} \\sim \\left( \\frac{u_L L / \\mathrm{Re}_L}{u_L} \\right)^{3/4} L^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{L}{\\mathrm{Re}_L} \\right)^{3/4} L^{1/4} = L^{3/4+1/4} \\mathrm{Re}_L^{-3/4}\n$$\n$$\nl_{\\perp,d} \\sim L \\, \\mathrm{Re}_L^{-3/4}\n$$\n\nWith $l_{\\perp,d}$, we can find the velocity increment $\\delta u_d$ and the parallel scale $l_{\\parallel,d}$ at the dissipation cutoff.\n$$\n\\delta u_d \\sim u_L \\left( \\frac{l_{\\perp,d}}{L} \\right)^{1/3} \\sim u_L \\left( \\frac{L \\, \\mathrm{Re}_L^{-3/4}}{L} \\right)^{1/3} = u_L \\left( \\mathrm{Re}_L^{-3/4} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta u_d \\sim u_L \\, \\mathrm{Re}_L^{-1/4}\n$$\nUsing the anisotropy relation for $l_{\\parallel,d}$:\n$$\nl_{\\parallel,d} \\sim \\frac{v_A}{u_L} L^{1/3} l_{\\perp,d}^{2/3} \\sim \\frac{v_A}{u_L} L^{1/3} \\left( L \\, \\mathrm{Re}_L^{-3/4} \\right)^{2/3} = \\frac{v_A}{u_L} L^{1/3} L^{2/3} \\mathrm{Re}_L^{(-3/4)(2/3)}\n$$\n$$\nl_{\\parallel,d} \\sim \\frac{v_A}{u_L} L \\, \\mathrm{Re}_L^{-1/2}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the target quantity, the parallel Reynolds number at the dissipation scale, $\\mathrm{Re}_{\\parallel,d} \\equiv (\\delta u_{d} l_{\\parallel,d})/\\nu$. We substitute the derived expressions for $\\delta u_d$, $l_{\\parallel,d}$, and the definition of $\\nu$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re}_{\\parallel,d} \\sim \\frac{ (u_L \\, \\mathrm{Re}_L^{-1/4}) \\left( \\frac{v_A}{u_L} L \\, \\mathrm{Re}_L^{-1/2} \\right) }{ u_L L / \\mathrm{Re}_L }\n$$\nThe terms $u_L$ in the numerator cancel.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re}_{\\parallel,d} \\sim \\frac{ v_A L \\, \\mathrm{Re}_L^{-1/4} \\, \\mathrm{Re}_L^{-1/2} }{ u_L L \\, \\mathrm{Re}_L^{-1} }\n$$\nThe scale $L$ cancels. We combine the powers of $\\mathrm{Re}_L$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re}_{\\parallel,d} \\sim \\frac{v_A}{u_L} \\mathrm{Re}_L^{(-1/4) + (-1/2) - (-1)} = \\frac{v_A}{u_L} \\mathrm{Re}_L^{-3/4 + 1}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re}_{\\parallel,d} \\sim \\frac{v_A}{u_L} \\mathrm{Re}_L^{1/4}\n$$\nThis is the final simplified symbolic expression in terms of the required variables.",

In terms of Elsasser variables $\\boldsymbol{z}^{\\pm} = \\boldsymbol{v} \\pm \\boldsymbol{b}$, the equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{z}^{\\pm}}{\\partial t} + (\\boldsymbol{z}^{\\mp} \\cdot \\nabla) \\boldsymbol{z}^{\\pm} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\nabla P_* + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{v} \\pm \\eta \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{b} + \\boldsymbol{f}^{\\pm}\n$$\nwhere $P_*$ is the total pressure (thermal + magnetic), $\\rho_0$ is the constant mass density (taken as $1$ in many theoretical treatments), $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, $\\eta$ is the magnetic diffusivity, and $\\boldsymbol{f}^{\\pm}$ represents external forcing. For clarity and without loss of generality, we set $\\rho_0=1$.\n\nStarting from these equations and imposing the assumptions of statistical **homogeneity** and **stationarity**, one can derive an exact relation for the flux of energy through the inertial range of the turbulence. This result is known as the Politano–Pouquet exact law. The derivation does not require the assumption of isotropy. The law takes the form of a vector relation in the separation vector space $\\boldsymbol{r}$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{r}} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r}) = -4\\varepsilon_{T}\n$$\nHere, $\\varepsilon_{T} = \\varepsilon^{+} + \\varepsilon^{-}$ is the total mean energy cascade rate per unit mass, where $\\varepsilon^{\\pm}$ are the cascade rates of the pseudo-energies $E^{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle|\\boldsymbol{z}^{\\pm}|^2\\rangle$. The vector $\\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r})$ is a third-order structure function, constructed from the Elsasser field increments $\\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{\\pm}(\\boldsymbol{r})$. Its full form is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r}) = \\left\\langle (\\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{-} \\cdot \\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{+}) (\\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{+} + \\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{-}) - (|\\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{+}|^2 \\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{-} + |\\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{-}|^2 \\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{+}) \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThis vector equation is the most general form of the law and is valid for any homogeneous, stationary, incompressible MHD turbulence, including the anisotropic case described in the problem.\n\nThe situation simplifies considerably if one makes the additional, strong assumption of **isotropy**. In isotropic turbulence, the third-order correlation vector $\\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r})$ must, by symmetry, be aligned with the separation vector $\\boldsymbol{r}$. That is, $\\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r}) = Y_L(r)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}}$, where $Y_L(r) = \\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r}) \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}}$ depends only on the magnitude $r=|\\boldsymbol{r}|$. The divergence operator in spherical coordinates then simplifies to $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{r}}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{Y} = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r^2 Y_L)$. The law becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{d}{dr}(r^2 Y_L) = -4\\varepsilon_{T}\n$$\nIntegrating this ordinary differential equation with respect to $r$ yields $r^2 Y_L = -\\frac{4}{3}\\varepsilon_{T} r^3$ (the integration constant is zero), which gives the famous scalar \"4/3 law\" for MHD:\n$$\nY_L(r) = -\\frac{4}{3}\\varepsilon_{T} r\n$$\nThis scalar relation holds *only* under the assumption of three-dimensional isotropy.\n\nThe problem explicitly states that the turbulence is **anisotropic** due to a strong mean magnetic field $\\boldsymbol{B}_0$, as described by the Goldreich–Sridhar model. In this model, turbulent eddies are elongated along $\\boldsymbol{B}_0$, leading to different correlation statistics parallel ($r_{\\|}$) and perpendicular ($r_{\\perp}$) to $\\boldsymbol{B}_0$. This breaks the assumption of isotropy. Consequently, the scalar relation $Y_L(r) = -\\frac{4}{3}\\varepsilon_{T} r$ is not valid. One must revert to the general vector law $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{r}} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r}) = -4\\varepsilon_{T}$. To estimate $\\varepsilon_T$ from data, one must measure the full third-order vector $\\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r})$ at many separation vectors $\\boldsymbol{r}$ to numerically compute its divergence, or use the divergence theorem by integrating the flux $\\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r})\\cdot d\\boldsymbol{S}$ over a closed surface in $\\boldsymbol{r}$-space.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In a strong mean-field plasma, the scalar isotropic relation for perpendicular separations, $\\langle \\delta z^{-}_{\\perp}\\,|\\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{+}|^{2} + \\delta z^{+}_{\\perp}\\,|\\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{-}|^{2} \\rangle = -\\tfrac{4}{3}\\,\\varepsilon_{T}\\,r_{\\perp}$, always holds, so projecting onto directions perpendicular to $\\boldsymbol{B}_0$ yields the cascade rate $\\varepsilon_{T}$ without further angular averaging.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The scalar relation with the specific factor of $-\\frac{4}{3}$ is a direct consequence of assuming three-dimensional isotropy, which allows for an analytical integration over solid angle. In an anisotropic system, this symmetry is broken. Even if one considers only separations perpendicular to the mean field ($\\boldsymbol{r} = \\boldsymbol{r}_{\\perp}$), the turbulence is at best gyrotropic (axisymmetric around $\\boldsymbol{B}_0$), not isotropic in the perpendicular plane. The flux vector $\\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\perp})$ is not guaranteed to be parallel to $\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\perp}$, a condition required for the simple linear scaling. Therefore, the scalar isotropic law does not \"always hold\" for perpendicular separations; it is an approximation at best. The general vector law must be used.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The exact Politano–Pouquet vector law holds without invoking isotropy: one must compute the divergence in separation space of the third-order flux vector $\\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r})$ built from Elsasser increments, $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{r}}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r}) = -4\\,\\varepsilon_{T}$, and estimate $\\varepsilon_{T}$ by angularly resolving $\\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r})$ or integrating its divergence, explicitly accounting for anisotropy.**\n\nThis statement is correct. It accurately states that the vector form of the Politano–Pouquet law, $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{r}}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r}) = -4\\,\\varepsilon_{T}$, is the fundamental result, derived solely from homogeneity and stationarity. It correctly identifies that this form holds regardless of isotropy. Furthermore, it correctly describes the necessary procedure for applying this law to anisotropic turbulence: one must determine the full vector field $\\boldsymbol{Y}(\\boldsymbol{r})$ and compute its divergence, either directly or via integration, fully accounting for its angular dependence with respect to the mean magnetic field.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. When cross helicity is nonzero, the correct diagnostic replaces third-order moments of Elsasser increments by those of the velocity alone, because the magnetic contribution does not participate in the forward cascade.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Cross helicity, $H_c = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle \\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{b} \\rangle$, measures the correlation between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations. Nonzero cross helicity implies an imbalance between the energy of the two Elsasser fields ($E^{+} \\neq E^{-}$). However, the total energy cascade involves both kinetic and magnetic energy. Both $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}$ (and thus both $\\boldsymbol{z}^{+}$ and $\\boldsymbol{z}^{-}$) are dynamically coupled and participate in the nonlinear energy transfer. The claim that the magnetic contribution does not participate in the cascade is a fundamental misunderstanding of MHD turbulence. The Politano-Pouquet law in either its $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{b})$ or $(\\boldsymbol{z}^{+}, \\boldsymbol{z}^{-})$ formulation explicitly retains all fields.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The sign of $\\langle \\delta z^{\\mp}_{L}\\,|\\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{\\pm}|^{2}\\rangle$ is positive for a forward cascade, so the third-order moments increase linearly and positively with separation $r$ whenever energy cascades from large to small scales.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A forward cascade, where energy flows from large to small scales, is defined by a positive dissipation rate, $\\varepsilon_{T} > 0$. In the isotropic case, the third-order longitudinal structure function is $Y_L(r) = -\\frac{4}{3}\\varepsilon_{T} r$. Since $\\varepsilon_{T} > 0$ and the separation $r > 0$, the sign of the third-order moment $Y_L(r)$ is **negative**. The statement claims the sign is positive, which is wrong. The moment becomes more negative (its magnitude increases) with increasing separation $r$. While the specific combination $\\langle \\delta z^{\\mp}_{L}\\,|\\delta \\boldsymbol{z}^{\\pm}|^{2}\\rangle$ is only a part of the full expression for $Y_L(r)$, the overall sign of the total third-order moment that diagnoses the cascade is negative for a forward cascade.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The tolerance $r_{\\mathrm{tol}}$ is provided as a decimal for each case.\n   - A frequency–ridge boolean $b_{\\omega}$ that is $\\text{True}$ if the measured angular frequency lies within a decorrelation width $\\sigma_{\\omega}$ of the Alfvénic ridge, where $\\sigma_{\\omega} = c_{\\sigma}\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{nl}}$, i.e., if $\\left|\\omega^{\\mathrm{meas}} - v_{\\mathrm{A}} k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{meas}}\\right| \\le c_{\\sigma}\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{nl}}$, and $\\text{False}$ otherwise. The coefficient $c_{\\sigma}$ is provided for each case.\n\n4. Return, for each test case, the list $[k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{CB}}, t_{\\mathrm{A}}, t_{\\mathrm{nl}}, b_{\\mathrm{CB}}, b_{\\omega}]$ with all floats expressed in the International System of Units (SI): $k_{\\parallel}$ in $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ and times in $\\mathrm{s}$. Floats must be rounded to $6$ significant digits. Booleans are unrounded.\n\nUse the following test suite, specified in SI units:\n\n- Case $1$ (happy path): $L = 10^9\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\epsilon = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\\mathrm{/s}^3$, $v_{\\mathrm{A}} = 5\\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $k_{\\perp} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 2.1\\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $\\omega^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 1.05\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $r_{\\mathrm{tol}} = 0.25$, $c_{\\sigma} = 1.0$.\n\n- Case $2$ (boundary tolerance): $L = 10^9\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\epsilon = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\\mathrm{/s}^3$, $v_{\\mathrm{A}} = 5\\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $k_{\\perp} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 4.0\\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $\\omega^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 2.04\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $r_{\\mathrm{tol}} = 0.20$, $c_{\\sigma} = 0.50$.\n\n- Case $3$ (weak turbulence edge): $L = 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\epsilon = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\\mathrm{/s}^3$, $v_{\\mathrm{A}} = 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $k_{\\perp} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 1.0\\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $\\omega^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 3.0\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $r_{\\mathrm{tol}} = 0.10$, $c_{\\sigma} = 1.0$.\n\n- Case $4$ (high-$k_{\\perp}$ edge): $L = 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\epsilon = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\\mathrm{/s}^3$, $v_{\\mathrm{A}} = 2\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $k_{\\perp} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 1.2\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $\\omega^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 2.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $r_{\\mathrm{tol}} = 0.15$, $c_{\\sigma} = 0.10$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element corresponds to a test case and is itself a list in the prescribed order.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established Goldreich-Sridhar phenomenology of Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, is mathematically well-posed, and provides a self-contained, consistent set of data and instructions for its solution. All provided physical parameters are within realistic ranges for astrophysical plasmas. The variable $L$ provided in the test cases is extraneous to the specified calculations but does not create a contradiction, likely serving as contextual information about the outer scale of turbulence.\n\nThe solution proceeds by deriving the necessary quantities from the foundational principles specified in the problem statement. Proportionality constants in the phenomenological relations are taken to be unity, as is standard practice unless specified otherwise and as implied by the instruction not to introduce additional closures.\n\n### Theoretical Framework and Derivations\n\nThe solution is based on the critical balance hypothesis in strong incompressible MHD turbulence. This hypothesis states that the timescale of linear wave propagation, $t_{\\mathrm{A}}$, is comparable to the timescale of nonlinear turbulent eddies, $t_{\\mathrm{nl}}$, at all scales in the inertial range.\n\n1.  **Nonlinear Interaction Time ($t_{\\mathrm{nl}}$)**: The problem posits a Kolmogorov-like cascade in the direction perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. The constant energy flux $\\epsilon$ (in units of $\\mathrm{m}^2\\mathrm{/s}^3$) is related to the velocity fluctuation $\\delta v$ at a perpendicular length scale $\\ell_{\\perp} \\sim 1/k_{\\perp}$ by $\\epsilon \\sim (\\delta v)^3 / \\ell_{\\perp} \\sim (\\delta v)^3 k_{\\perp}$. From this, we derive the characteristic velocity increment at a given perpendicular wavenumber $k_{\\perp}$:\n    $$ \\delta v(k_{\\perp}) = (\\epsilon / k_{\\perp})^{1/3} $$\n    The nonlinear interaction time, or eddy turnover time, $t_{\\mathrm{nl}}$, is the time it takes for an eddy of size $\\ell_{\\perp}$ to turn over, which is $t_{\\mathrm{nl}} \\sim \\ell_{\\perp} / \\delta v$. In terms of wavenumber $k_{\\perp}$, this becomes:\n    $$ t_{\\mathrm{nl}}(k_{\\perp}) = \\frac{1}{k_{\\perp} \\delta v(k_{\\perp})} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\perp} (\\epsilon/k_{\\perp})^{1/3}} = (\\epsilon k_{\\perp}^2)^{-1/3} $$\n    The corresponding nonlinear frequency is $\\omega_{\\mathrm{nl}} = 1/t_{\\mathrm{nl}}$:\n    $$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{nl}}(k_{\\perp}) = k_{\\perp} \\delta v(k_{\\perp}) = (\\epsilon k_{\\perp}^2)^{1/3} $$\n\n2.  **Linear Alfvén Time ($t_{\\mathrm{A}}$)**: The linear dynamics are governed by the Alfvén wave dispersion relation, $\\omega = v_{\\mathrm{A}} k_{\\parallel}$, where $v_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is the Alfvén speed and $k_{\\parallel}$ is the parallel component of the wavenumber. The linear wave period, or Alfvén time $t_{\\mathrm{A}}$, is the inverse of this frequency:\n    $$ t_{\\mathrm{A}}(k_{\\parallel}) = \\frac{1}{\\omega} = \\frac{1}{v_{\\mathrm{A}} k_{\\parallel}} $$\n    For each test case, the measured linear Alfvén time is computed using the *measured* parallel wavenumber, $k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{meas}}$:\n    $$ t_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{1}{v_{\\mathrm{A}} k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{meas}}} $$\n\n3.  **Critical Balance and Predicted Parallel Wavenumber ($k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{CB}}$)**: The critical balance condition equates the linear and nonlinear timescales, $t_{\\mathrm{A}} \\sim t_{\\mathrm{nl}}$. This implies their corresponding frequencies are also equal, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{A}} \\sim \\omega_{\\mathrm{nl}}$.\n    $$ v_{\\mathrm{A}} k_{\\parallel} \\approx k_{\\perp} \\delta v(k_{\\perp}) $$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\delta v(k_{\\perp})$, we can solve for the predicted parallel wavenumber, $k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{CB}}$, that satisfies the critical balance condition:\n    $$ v_{\\mathrm{A}} k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{CB}} = k_{\\perp} (\\epsilon/k_{\\perp})^{1/3} = \\epsilon^{1/3} k_{\\perp}^{2/3} $$\n    $$ k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{CB}}(k_{\\perp}, \\epsilon, v_{\\mathrm{A}}) = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/3} k_{\\perp}^{2/3}}{v_{\\mathrm{A}}} $$\n    This is the celebrated anisotropic scaling relation of Goldreich & Sridhar (1995).\n\n### Computational Steps for Each Test Case\n\nFor each set of parameters ($\\epsilon$, $v_{\\mathrm{A}}$, $k_{\\perp}$, $k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{meas}}$, $\\omega^{\\mathrm{meas}}$, $r_{\\mathrm{tol}}$, $c_{\\sigma}$), the following quantities are computed:\n\n1.  **Calculations**:\n    -   The nonlinear frequency: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{nl}} = (\\epsilon k_{\\perp}^2)^{1/3}$.\n    -   The nonlinear time: $t_{\\mathrm{nl}} = 1/\\omega_{\\mathrm{nl}}$.\n    -   The critically-balanced parallel wavenumber: $k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{CB}} = \\epsilon^{1/3} k_{\\perp}^{2/3} / v_{\\mathrm{A}}$.\n    -   The measured linear Alfvén time: $t_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1 / (v_{\\mathrm{A}} k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{meas}})$.\n\n2.  **Diagnostic Evaluations**:\n    -   **Critical-balance proximity ($b_{\\mathrm{CB}}$)**: This boolean is $\\text{True}$ if the measured parallel wavenumber $k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{meas}}$ is within a relative tolerance $r_{\\mathrm{tol}}$ of the predicted value $k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{CB}}$.\n        $$ b_{\\mathrm{CB}} = \\left( |k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{CB}}| \\le r_{\\mathrm{tol}} \\cdot k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{CB}} \\right) $$\n    -   **Frequency–ridge proximity ($b_{\\omega}$)**: This boolean is $\\text{True}$ if the measured frequency $\\omega^{\\mathrm{meas}}$ is within a spectral width $\\sigma_{\\omega} = c_{\\sigma} \\omega_{\\mathrm{nl}}$ of the frequency predicted by the linear Alfvén relation for the measured parallel wavenumber, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{A}}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = v_{\\mathrm{A}} k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{meas}}$.\n        $$ b_{\\omega} = \\left( |\\omega^{\\mathrm{meas}} - v_{\\mathrm{A}} k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{meas}}| \\le c_{\\sigma} \\cdot \\omega_{\\mathrm{nl}} \\right) $$\n\n3.  **Output Formatting**:\n    -   All floating-point results ($k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{CB}}$, $t_{\\mathrm{A}}$, $t_{\\mathrm{nl}}$) are rounded to $6$ significant digits.\n    -   The final output for each case is a list: $[k_{\\parallel}^{\\mathrm{CB}}, t_{\\mathrm{A}}, t_{\\mathrm{nl}}, b_{\\mathrm{CB}}, b_{\\omega}]$.\n\nThese steps are implemented for each provided test case.",
