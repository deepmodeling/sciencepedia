From kinetic theory, the pressure of an ideal gas is given by $P_{gas} = n k_B T$, where $n$ is the total particle number density (ions and electrons), $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

The large-scale dynamics and structure of the accretion disk are primarily determined by gas pressure and gravity. Magnetic field lines are effectively \"frozen\" into the plasma and are carried along by its motion. While the magnetic field is dynamically sub-dominant on large scales, it remains fundamentally important for driving turbulence through mechanisms like the Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI), which is essential for transporting angular momentum outward and allowing accretion to proceed.\n-   In the regime $\\beta \\sim 1$, the magnetic pressure is comparable to the gas pressure ($P_{mag} \\sim P_{gas}$). The magnetic field is no longer a passive component but plays a crucial, active dynamical role. It can significantly alter the disk's vertical structure, drive powerful winds or jets, and contribute directly and substantially to the total pressure supporting the disk. The interplay between fluid dynamics and magnetic forces is highly complex, and the resulting turbulence is strong. This regime is often associated with the launching of powerful outflows from the innermost regions of accretion disks.",

The equation is a quadratic in $X$:\n$$ X^2 + X(2Y + \\Omega^2) + (Y^2 - 3\\Omega^2 Y) = 0 $$\nSolving for $X = \\gamma^2$:\n$$ \\gamma^2 = \\frac{-(2Y + \\Omega^2) \\pm \\sqrt{(2Y + \\Omega^2)^2 - 4(Y^2 - 3\\Omega^2 Y)}}{2} $$\n$$ \\gamma^2 = \\frac{-(2\\omega_A^2 + \\Omega^2) \\pm \\sqrt{\\Omega^4 + 16\\Omega^2\\omega_A^2}}{2} $$\nFor instability, we require $\\gamma^2 > 0$. We must take the '$+$' sign.\n$$ \\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ -(2\\omega_A^2 + \\Omega^2) + \\sqrt{\\Omega^4 + 16\\Omega^2\\omega_A^2} \\right] $$\nTo find the maximum growth rate, we maximize $\\gamma^2$ with respect to $\\omega_A^2$:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\gamma^2)}{d(\\omega_A^2)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ -2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\Omega^4 + 16\\Omega^2\\omega_A^2)^{-1/2} (16\\Omega^2) \\right] = 0 $$\n$$ 4\\Omega^2 = \\sqrt{\\Omega^4 + 16\\Omega^2\\omega_A^2} $$\nSquaring both sides gives $16\\Omega^4 = \\Omega^4 + 16\\Omega^2\\omega_A^2$, which yields the value of $\\omega_A^2$ for the maximum growth rate:\n$$ \\omega_{A, \\max}^2 = \\frac{15\\Omega^4}{16\\Omega^2} = \\frac{15}{16}\\Omega^2 $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\gamma^2$:\n$$ \\gamma_{\\max}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ -2\\left(\\frac{15}{16}\\Omega^2\\right) - \\Omega^2 + \\sqrt{\\Omega^4 + 16\\Omega^2\\left(\\frac{15}{16}\\Omega^2\\right)} \\right] $$\n$$ \\gamma_{\\max}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ -\\frac{15}{8}\\Omega^2 - \\Omega^2 + \\sqrt{16\\Omega^4} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ -\\frac{23}{8}\\Omega^2 + 4\\Omega^2 \\right] = \\frac{9}{16}\\Omega^2 $$\nThe maximum growth rate is therefore:\n$$ \\gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{3}{4}\\Omega $$\nThe wavenumber of the fastest-growing mode, $k_{z, \\max}$, is found from $\\omega_{A, \\max}^2$:\n$$ k_{z, \\max}^2 v_A^2 = \\frac{15}{16}\\Omega^2 \\implies k_{z, \\max} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}\\frac{\\Omega}{v_A} $$\nThe corresponding wavelength $\\lambda_{\\max}$ is:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\max} = \\frac{2\\pi}{k_{z, \\max}} = \\frac{8\\pi}{\\sqrt{15}}\\frac{v_A}{\\Omega} $$\nNow we evaluate these quantities using the given parameters:\n$\\rho = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$, $B = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{T}$, $\\Omega = 3.65 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, $H = 3.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\nThe magnetic permeability of free space is $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{N\\,A^{-2}}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the Alfvén speed $v_A$:\n$$ v_A = \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{T}}{\\sqrt{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{N\\,A^{-2}}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}})}} \\approx 8921.4\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\nNext, we compute the maximum growth rate $\\gamma_{\\max}$:\n$$ \\gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{3}{4}\\Omega = \\frac{3}{4} (3.65 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) = 0.027375\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $\\gamma_{\\max} = 2.74 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\nThen, we compute the wavelength of the fastest-growing mode $\\lambda_{\\max}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\max} = \\frac{8\\pi}{\\sqrt{15}}\\frac{v_A}{\\Omega} \\approx 6.488 \\times \\frac{8921.4\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}}{3.65 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\approx 1.5859 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $\\lambda_{\\max} = 1.59 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFinally, we assess if this wavelength fits within the disk scale height $H = 3.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\max} = 1.59 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{m} \\leq 3.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{m} = H $$\nThe condition is satisfied. Therefore, the value of $\\chi$ is $1$.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix $(\\gamma_{\\max}, \\lambda_{\\max}, \\chi)$.",
