From the equation of state:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dr} = \\frac{k_B T_0}{\\mu m_p} \\frac{d\\rho}{dr} $$\nWe can identify the isothermal sound speed squared as:\n$$ c_s^2 = \\frac{k_B T_0}{\\mu m_p} $$\nThis provides the expression for $c_s$ as requested: $c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_0}{\\mu m_p}}$.\n\nUsing $c_s^2$, the pressure gradient term in the momentum equation becomes $\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{dP}{dr} = \\frac{c_s^2}{\\rho}\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}$.

This requires the flow to pass through a sonic point, where $v=c_s$. At this point, the denominator of the wind equation, $v^2 - c_s^2$, becomes zero. For the velocity gradient $\\frac{dv}{dr}$ to be finite and non-zero (i.e., for the solution to be smooth and accelerating), the numerator must also be zero at the same location. This unique location is the critical radius, $r_c$.\n\nThe condition for the critical point is that at $r=r_c$, we have $v=c_s$ and the numerator is zero:\n$$ 2c_s^2 r_c - GM = 0 $$\nSolving for $r_c$ gives the expression for the critical radius:\n$$ r_c = \\frac{GM}{2c_s^2} $$\nThis is the condition for a smooth transonic solution.\n\nNext, we evaluate these quantities numerically for the given solar parameters.\n$T_0 = 1.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $M = M_{\\odot} = 1.98847 \\times 10^{30}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $\\mu = 0.6$.\nConstants: $G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,kg^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}$, $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$, $m_p = 1.6726219 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, and $R_{\\odot} = 6.957 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the square of the isothermal sound speed, $c_s^2$:\n$$ c_s^2 = \\frac{k_B T_0}{\\mu m_p} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) (1.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(0.6)(1.6726219 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg})} $$\n$$ c_s^2 \\approx \\frac{2.0709735 \\times 10^{-17}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{1.0035731 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}} \\approx 2.06359 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}} $$\nThe isothermal sound speed is:\n$$ c_s = \\sqrt{2.06359 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}}} \\approx 1.4365 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} \\approx 143.7\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}} $$\n\nNow, calculate the critical radius $r_c$:\n$$ r_c = \\frac{GM_{\\odot}}{2c_s^2} = \\frac{(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,kg^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}) (1.98847 \\times 10^{30}\\,\\mathrm{kg})}{2(2.06359 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}})} $$\n$$ r_c \\approx \\frac{1.327124 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-2}}}{4.12718 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}}} \\approx 3.21558 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer as the ratio $r_c/R_{\\odot}$:\n$$ \\frac{r_c}{R_{\\odot}} = \\frac{3.21558 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{m}}{6.957 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 4.62218 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $4.62$.\n\nFinally, we explain why $r_c$ lies a few solar radii from the photosphere. The location of the critical point is determined by a balance between the thermal energy of the gas, which drives the expansion, and the gravitational potential energy, which resists it. The condition $r_c = GM/(2c_s^2)$ can be rearranged to compare energies. The gravitational potential energy per unit mass is $-GM/r$, and a measure of the thermal energy per unit mass is proportional to $c_s^2$. Specifically, at $r_c$, we have $\\frac{GM}{r_c} = 2c_s^2$. The magnitude of the gravitational potential energy per particle at $r_c$ is $\\frac{GM\\mu m_p}{r_c}$, which, using the expression for $c_s^2$, is equal to $2k_B T_0$. This means the critical point occurs where the gravitational binding energy per particle is comparable to (twice) its thermal energy.\n\nWe can re-express this in terms of characteristic velocities. The escape velocity from the solar surface (photosphere) at $r=R_{\\odot}$ is $v_{esc,\\odot} = \\sqrt{2GM_{\\odot}/R_{\\odot}} \\approx 618\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. The thermal sound speed in the hot corona ($T_0 \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{K}$) is $c_s \\approx 144\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. The ratio of these speeds is $v_{esc,\\odot}/c_s \\approx 4.3$.\nWe can write $r_c$ in terms of this ratio:\n$$ \\frac{r_c}{R_{\\odot}} = \\frac{GM_{\\odot}}{2c_s^2 R_{\\odot}} = \\frac{R_{\\odot}}{R_{\\odot}} \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{2GM_{\\odot}/R_{\\odot}}{c_s^2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{v_{esc,\\odot}}{c_s}\\right)^2 $$\nSince the escape velocity from the surface is a few times larger than the coronal sound speed ($v_{esc,\\odot} \\approx 4.3 c_s$), the critical radius must be a few solar radii:\n$$ \\frac{r_c}{R_{\\odot}} \\approx \\frac{1}{4}(4.3)^2 \\approx 4.6 $$\nThe high temperature of the corona makes the thermal energy a significant fraction of the gravitational binding energy, pushing the critical point for acceleration to supersonic speeds out to several solar radii, thereby enabling a powerful stellar wind. If the corona were cooler, $c_s$ would be smaller, and $r_c$ would be much larger, effectively shutting off the wind.",

The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem poses a clear question about the boundary conditions required to obtain a solution with specific mathematical properties (smoothness, transonic nature) for a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This is a well-posed problem in mathematical physics.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The language used is precise, technical, and free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically valid, well-posed, objective, and complete for the task at hand. It accurately represents the core concepts of the Parker solar wind model. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins by combining the governing equations into a single ordinary differential equation for the wind speed $V$ as a function of radius $r$.\n\n1.  **Derivation of the Wind Equation:**\n    The momentum equation is $V\\frac{dV}{dr} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{dp}{dr} - \\frac{G M_\\odot}{r^2}$. We use the definition of the sound speed squared, $c_s^2 \\equiv \\frac{dp}{d\\rho}$, to write $\\frac{dp}{dr} = \\frac{dp}{d\\rho}\\frac{d\\rho}{dr} = c_s^2 \\frac{d\\rho}{dr}$. The momentum equation becomes:\n    $$V\\frac{dV}{dr} = -\\frac{c_s^2}{\\rho}\\frac{d\\rho}{dr} - \\frac{G M_\\odot}{r^2}$$\n    From mass conservation, $F = \\rho V r^2$ is constant. Taking the logarithmic derivative with respect to $r$:\n    $$\\frac{d}{dr}(\\ln F) = 0 = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{d\\rho}{dr} + \\frac{1}{V}\\frac{dV}{dr} + \\frac{2}{r}$$\n    We solve for the density gradient term:\n    $$\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{d\\rho}{dr} = -\\left(\\frac{1}{V}\\frac{dV}{dr} + \\frac{2}{r}\\right)$$\n    Substituting this into the momentum equation:\n    $$V\\frac{dV}{dr} = -c_s^2 \\left[ - \\left(\\frac{1}{V}\\frac{dV}{dr} + \\frac{2}{r}\\right) \\right] - \\frac{G M_\\odot}{r^2}$$\n    $$V\\frac{dV}{dr} = \\frac{c_s^2}{V}\\frac{dV}{dr} + \\frac{2c_s^2}{r} - \\frac{G M_\\odot}{r^2}$$\n    Collecting the terms involving $\\frac{dV}{dr}$:\n    $$\\left(V - \\frac{c_s^2}{V}\\right) \\frac{dV}{dr} = \\frac{2c_s^2}{r} - \\frac{G M_\\odot}{r^2}$$\n    Multiplying by $V/V$ gives the standard form of the Parker wind equation:\n    $$\\frac{1}{V}\\frac{dV}{dr}\\left(V^2 - c_s^2\\right) = \\frac{2c_s^2}{r} - \\frac{G M_\\odot}{r^2}$$\n    This can be rearranged to express the velocity gradient explicitly:\n    $$\\frac{dV}{dr} = \\frac{V \\left( \\frac{2c_s^2}{r} - \\frac{GM_\\odot}{r^2} \\right)}{V^2 - c_s^2}$$\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Critical Point:**\n    The equation for $\\frac{dV}{dr}$ has the form of a fraction. A singularity (an infinite gradient, $\\frac{dV}{dr} \\to \\infty$) occurs if the denominator is zero while the numerator is non-zero. The denominator is zero when $V^2 = c_s^2$, i.e., when the flow speed equals the local sound speed.\n    A physically acceptable, smooth solution must avoid such singularities. A smooth transonic solution is possible only if the flow passes through the sonic point in such a way that the gradient $\\frac{dV}{dr}$ remains finite. This requires that both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction are simultaneously zero. This condition defines the sonic critical point $(r_c, V_c)$.\n    -   Denominator is zero: $V(r_c)^2 = c_s(r_c)^2 \\implies V_c = c_s(r_c)$.\n    -   Numerator is zero: $\\frac{2c_s(r_c)^2}{r_c} - \\frac{GM_\\odot}{r_c^2} = 0$.\n\n    From the numerator condition, we find the critical radius $r_c$:\n    $$2c_s(r_c)^2 r_c = GM_\\odot \\implies r_c = \\frac{GM_\\odot}{2c_s(r_c)^2}$$\n    For the simple isothermal case where $c_s$ is a constant determined by the coronal temperature $T_0$, the critical radius is uniquely determined: $r_c = \\frac{GM_\\odot}{2c_s^2}$. The critical velocity is $V_c = c_s$.\n\n3.  **Eigenvalue Nature of the Solution:**\n    The system of equations must satisfy not only the differential equation but also the algebraic conditions at the critical point. To integrate the ODE, one must specify boundary conditions at the coronal base, $r=R_\\odot$. For instance, one could specify the temperature $T_0$ (which fixes $c_s$ in the isothermal model), the base density $\\rho_0$, and the base velocity $V_0$. These values collectively determine the mass flux constant $F = \\rho_0 V_0 R_\\odot^2$ and the Bernoulli constant (the energy integral of the momentum equation).\n    However, an arbitrary choice of these base parameters will produce a solution trajectory $V(r)$ that, in general, does not pass through the unique critical point $(r_c, V_c)$.\n    -   If the mass flux $F$ is too low, the solution remains subsonic for all $r$ and approaches a finite pressure at $r \\to \\infty$ (a \"subsonic breeze\").\n    -   If the mass flux $F$ is too high, the solution is multi-valued and unphysical, or it accelerates and then decelerates back to subsonic speeds.\n    -   Only for one specific, unique value of the mass flux $F$ (for a given temperature structure) does the solution pass exactly through the critical point, allowing it to accelerate smoothly from subsonic to supersonic speeds.\n    This requirement that the solution must pass through the critical point acts as a constraint that selects a unique value for the mass flux $F$. Because a physical parameter is determined by a global condition on the solution rather than being freely chosen as a boundary condition, it is termed an \"eigenvalue\" of the problem.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. One must specify a thermodynamic state at the base (e.g., $\\,T_0\\,$ and $\\,n_0\\,$ or $\\,p_0\\,$) together with a small outward $\\,V_0>0\\,$, which fixes the base mass flux $\\,F_0=\\rho_0 V_0 R_\\odot^2\\,$. For a given $\\,T_0\\,$ (equivalently, $\\,c_s\\,$ or the polytropic $\\,K,\\gamma\\,$), only the unique choice of $\\,F_0\\,$ that allows the solution to pass smoothly through the sonic critical point yields a physically acceptable transonic wind; this regularity condition effectively selects $\\,F_0\\,$ (or $\\,n_0 V_0\\,$) as an eigenvalue.**\n    This statement accurately reflects the analysis. For a given thermal structure (fixed $T_0 \\implies$ fixed $c_s$), the requirement of a smooth transonic solution is a strong constraint that uniquely determines the mass flux $F_0$. Thus, $F_0$ is not a free parameter but an eigenvalue selected by the sonic point regularity condition.\n    **Verdict: Correct**\n\n*   **B. For any arbitrary choice of $\\,T_0\\,$, $\\,n_0\\,$, and $\\,V_0\\,$ at $\\,r=R_\\odot\\,$, the ODEs integrate to a smooth transonic solution; the sonic regularity condition imposes no restriction on the base mass flux.**\n    This is incorrect. As derived above, an arbitrary choice of base parameters, which corresponds to an arbitrary mass flux, will not produce a transonic solution. The regularity condition is precisely the restriction that singles out the correct mass flux.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **C. The only necessary base condition for a transonic wind is $\\,V_0=c_{s,0}\\,$ at $\\,r=R_\\odot\\,$; if the flow starts sonic at the base, it is guaranteed to be transonic, independent of $\\,T_0\\,$ or $\\,n_0\\,$.**\n    This is incorrect. The sonic critical point $r_c$ for the Sun is located at several solar radii, so $r_c > R_\\odot$. At the base $r=R_\\odot$, the gravitational term dominates the pressure term in the numerator of the wind equation, making the numerator negative. If the flow were to start at the sonic speed ($V_0 = c_{s,0}$), the denominator would be zero, leading to an infinite negative gradient ($\\frac{dV}{dr} \\to -\\infty$). The flow would immediately decelerate, which is unphysical and not a wind solution.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **D. If $\\,V_0\\ll c_{s,0}\\,$, the mathematically consistent outcome is a subsonic breeze solution that remains subsonic for all $\\,r\\,$; this is physically acceptable because it leads to vanishing pressure at large $\\,r\\,$.**\n    The first part of the statement is correct: for an arbitrary choice of small $V_0$ (not corresponding to the eigenvalue mass flux), the solution is a subsonic breeze. However, the second part is incorrect. A key property of these breeze solutions is that the pressure approaches a finite, non-zero value as $r \\to \\infty$. This would require the solar system to be embedded in an interstellar medium with that specific pressure to confine the flow, which is not observed. Hence, subsonic breeze solutions are considered physically unacceptable.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **E. Specifying $\\,T_0\\,$ and $\\,p_0\\,$ at $\\,r=R_\\odot\\,$ while leaving $\\,V_0\\,$ free produces a continuum of distinct smooth transonic solutions parameterized by $\\,V_0\\,$; no eigenvalue selection is required.**\n    This is incorrect. It claims that a continuum of transonic solutions exists, which directly contradicts the uniqueness of the eigenvalue solution. For a fixed base temperature and pressure (and thus density), varying $V_0$ varies the mass flux $F = \\rho_0 V_0 R_\\odot^2$. As established, only a single value of this mass flux allows for a smooth transonic solution. Therefore, $V_0$ is not a free parameter.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**",

The governing equations are standard representations of mass and momentum conservation for a steady, spherically symmetric, ideal fluid flow under gravity. The problem is fundamentally sound and based on well-established physics.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem asks to identify a correct numerical procedure for solving the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE). The existence of a unique transonic solution passing smoothly through the critical point is a well-known result. The question is well-posed as it concerns the verification of established numerical techniques for this specific, well-defined problem.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is formal, precise, and technical, using standard terminology from physics and numerical analysis. It is free of any subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, self-contained, and objective. It poses a standard question in computational astrophysics. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Analysis\nFirst, we derive the Parker wind equation from the given governing laws.\n\nFrom the mass conservation equation, $\\rho V r^2 = \\text{constant}$, we can take the logarithmic derivative with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\dfrac{1}{\\rho}\\dfrac{d\\rho}{dr} + \\dfrac{1}{V}\\dfrac{dV}{dr} + \\dfrac{2}{r} = 0 $$\n$$ \\implies \\dfrac{1}{\\rho}\\dfrac{d\\rho}{dr} = -\\left( \\dfrac{1}{V}\\dfrac{dV}{dr} + \\dfrac{2}{r} \\right) $$\n\nThe isothermal equation of state is $P = c_s^2 \\rho$. Since $c_s$ is constant, differentiating with respect to $r$ gives $\\dfrac{dP}{dr} = c_s^2 \\dfrac{d\\rho}{dr}$. The pressure gradient term in the momentum equation is thus:\n$$ \\dfrac{1}{\\rho}\\dfrac{dP}{dr} = \\dfrac{c_s^2}{\\rho}\\dfrac{d\\rho}{dr} $$\n\nSubstitute this and the expression for $\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}$ into the momentum equation:\n$$ V \\dfrac{dV}{dr} = - c_s^2 \\left[ -\\left( \\dfrac{1}{V}\\dfrac{dV}{dr} + \\dfrac{2}{r} \\right) \\right] - \\dfrac{G M_\\star}{r^2} $$\n$$ V \\dfrac{dV}{dr} = \\dfrac{c_s^2}{V}\\dfrac{dV}{dr} + \\dfrac{2c_s^2}{r} - \\dfrac{G M_\\star}{r^2} $$\n\nNow, we collect the terms with $\\dfrac{dV}{dr}$:\n$$ \\left( V - \\dfrac{c_s^2}{V} \\right) \\dfrac{dV}{dr} = \\dfrac{2c_s^2}{r} - \\dfrac{G M_\\star}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\dfrac{V^2 - c_s^2}{V} \\dfrac{dV}{dr} = \\dfrac{2c_s^2 r - G M_\\star}{r^2} $$\n\nThis is the Parker wind equation, which can be written as:\n$$ \\dfrac{dV}{dr} = \\dfrac{V}{r^2} \\dfrac{2c_s^2 r - G M_\\star}{V^2 - c_s^2} $$\n\nThis is a first-order ODE of the form $\\dfrac{dV}{dr} = \\dfrac{N(r, V)}{D(r, V)}$. The equation has a critical point where the denominator is zero, which occurs at the sonic speed $V=c_s$. For a physically meaningful transonic solution that is smooth and continuous, the derivative $\\dfrac{dV}{dr}$ must be finite at this point. This requires the numerator to also be zero, a condition known as the regularity condition.\n\nThe critical point $(r_c, V_c)$ is defined by:\n1.  Denominator is zero: $V_c^2 - c_s^2 = 0 \\implies V_c = c_s$.\n2.  Numerator is zero: $2c_s^2 r_c - G M_\\star = 0 \\implies r_c = \\dfrac{G M_\\star}{2c_s^2}$.\n\nAt the critical point $(r_c, c_s)$, the wind equation is of the indeterminate form $\\dfrac{0}{0}$. To find the slope $\\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}$, we apply L'Hôpital's rule. Let $y' = \\dfrac{dV}{dr}$.\n$$ y' = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{d}{dr} \\left[ V \\left( \\dfrac{2c_s^2}{r} - \\dfrac{G M_\\star}{r^2} \\right) \\right]}{\\dfrac{d}{dr} [V^2 - c_s^2]} $$\nLet's evaluate the numerator and denominator of this new expression at $r=r_c$, where $V=c_s$ and $y' = \\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}$.\n\nDerivative of the denominator:\n$$ \\dfrac{d}{dr}(V^2 - c_s^2) = 2V \\dfrac{dV}{dr} = 2V y' \\quad \\xrightarrow{r \\to r_c} \\quad 2c_s y' $$\n\nDerivative of the numerator (using the product rule):\n$$ \\dfrac{d}{dr} \\left[ V \\left( \\underbrace{\\dfrac{2c_s^2}{r} - \\dfrac{G M_\\star}{r^2}}_{\\text{=0 at } r_c} \\right) \\right] = y' \\left( \\dfrac{2c_s^2}{r} - \\dfrac{G M_\\star}{r^2} \\right) + V \\left( -\\dfrac{2c_s^2}{r^2} + \\dfrac{2G M_\\star}{r^3} \\right) $$\nAt $r=r_c$, the first term is zero. Substituting $V=c_s$ and $G M_\\star = 2c_s^2 r_c$ into the second term:\n$$ \\left. \\text{Numerator}' \\right|_{r_c} = c_s \\left( -\\dfrac{2c_s^2}{r_c^2} + \\dfrac{2(2c_s^2 r_c)}{r_c^3} \\right) = c_s \\left( -\\dfrac{2c_s^2}{r_c^2} + \\dfrac{4c_s^2}{r_c^2} \\right) = \\dfrac{2c_s^3}{r_c^2} $$\n\nApplying L'Hôpital's rule gives:\n$$ y' = \\dfrac{2c_s^3/r_c^2}{2c_s y'} \\implies (y')^2 = \\dfrac{c_s^2}{r_c^2} \\implies y' = \\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c} = \\pm \\dfrac{c_s}{r_c} $$\n\nFor an accelerating outflowing wind, the velocity must increase with radius, so we must choose the positive root: $\\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c} = +\\dfrac{c_s}{r_c}$. The negative root describes a decelerating inflow (accretion).\n\nThe numerical strategy is to start an integration slightly away from the singular point $r_c$. We use a first-order Taylor expansion around $r_c$:\n$$ V(r) \\approx V(r_c) + \\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c} (r - r_c) $$\nFor the outward integration, we start at $r_+ = r_c + \\varepsilon$:\n$$ V(r_+) \\approx c_s + \\left(+\\dfrac{c_s}{r_c}\\right) \\varepsilon $$\nFor the inward integration, we start at $r_- = r_c - \\varepsilon$:\n$$ V(r_-) \\approx c_s + \\left(+\\dfrac{c_s}{r_c}\\right) (-\\varepsilon) = c_s - \\dfrac{c_s}{r_c} \\varepsilon $$\n\nThe problem can also be formulated in terms of the Mach number, $M(r) = V(r)/c_s$. The wind equation becomes:\n$$ \\dfrac{dM}{dr} = \\dfrac{M}{M^2-1} \\left( \\dfrac{2}{r} - \\dfrac{G M_\\star}{c_s^2 r^2} \\right) $$\nThe critical point is at $M_c=1$ and $r_c = \\dfrac{G M_\\star}{2c_s^2}$. Applying L'Hôpital's rule to this equation yields:\n$$ \\left( \\left.\\dfrac{dM}{dr}\\right|_{r_c} \\right)^2 = \\dfrac{1}{r_c^2} \\implies \\left.\\dfrac{dM}{dr}\\right|_{r_c} = \\pm \\dfrac{1}{r_c} $$\nFor an accelerating wind, we choose the positive root, $\\left.\\dfrac{dM}{dr}\\right|_{r_c} = +\\dfrac{1}{r_c}$. The Taylor expansion then gives:\n$$ M(r_\\pm) \\approx M(r_c) + \\left.\\dfrac{dM}{dr}\\right|_{r_c} (r_\\pm - r_c) = 1 \\pm \\left(+\\dfrac{1}{r_c}\\right)\\varepsilon $$\n\nWith these results, we can evaluate the options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n**A. Compute $r_c$ from the condition that the right-hand side and the characteristic factor in the wind equation vanish simultaneously, set $V(r_c)=c_s$, and obtain $\\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}$ by applying L’Hôpital’s rule to the wind equation, yielding $\\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}=\\pm \\dfrac{c_s}{r_c}$. For the outflowing transonic wind, choose the positive root. Initialize at $r_\\pm=r_c\\pm \\varepsilon$ with $V(r_\\pm)=c_s\\pm \\left(\\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}\\right)\\varepsilon$ for a small $\\varepsilon\\ll r_c$, then integrate outward from $r_+=r_c+\\varepsilon$ to large $r$ and inward from $r_-=r_c-\\varepsilon$ toward the base, using an adaptive explicit integrator for the first-order ordinary differential equation.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that both the numerator and denominator of the wind equation must vanish at $r_c$. It correctly states the result of applying L'Hôpital's rule, $\\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}=\\pm \\dfrac{c_s}{r_c}$, and correctly chooses the positive root for the wind solution. The initialization procedure using a first-order Taylor expansion, $V(r_c \\pm \\varepsilon) = c_s \\pm \\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}\\varepsilon$, is correct. The overall shooting strategy (integrating outward and inward from offsets) and the use of an adaptive integrator are standard and robust.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. To avoid numerical stiffness, enforce $\\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}=0$ and start the integration at $r=r_c$ with $V(r_c)=c_s$, integrating only outward; the solution will regularize itself and pass smoothly through the sonic point without needing inward integration.**\n\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. The slope at the critical point is not zero; it is $\\pm c_s/r_c$. Setting it to zero is a physical and mathematical error. Furthermore, starting an integration directly at a singular point of an ODE is numerically ill-advised and will likely fail or produce highly inaccurate results. The claim that the solution will \"regularize itself\" is not how numerical integrators work with singularities.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Use the same setup as in option A, but initialize the slope at the critical point as $\\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}=+\\dfrac{c_s}{2 r_c}$ for the outflowing solution; then integrate outward from $r_c+\\varepsilon$ and inward from $r_c-\\varepsilon$.**\n\nThis option proposes an incorrect value for the slope at the critical point. As derived above, the slope is $\\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c} = +\\dfrac{c_s}{r_c}$ for the wind solution. The value $+\\dfrac{c_s}{2 r_c}$ is incorrect for the isothermal Parker model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Determine the critical radius $r_c$ and set $V(r_c)=c_s$, but select the negative root $\\left.\\dfrac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}=-\\dfrac{c_s}{r_c}$ to propagate the wind outward from $r_c+\\varepsilon$; the inward branch can be reconstructed by symmetry.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the magnitude of the slope but selects the wrong sign. The negative root corresponds to a solution where velocity decreases with increasing radius, which describes accretion, not an outflowing wind. An accelerating wind must have a positive velocity gradient. The claim about reconstructing the inward branch by symmetry is also unsubstantiated and incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Work with the Mach number $M(r)\\equiv \\dfrac{V(r)}{c_s}$ and recast the momentum equation into a first-order ordinary differential equation for $M(r)$. Enforce the critical conditions at $r_c$ with $M(r_c)=1$ and use the regularity condition to obtain $\\left.\\dfrac{dM}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}=\\pm \\dfrac{1}{r_c}$. For the outflowing transonic wind, choose the positive root, initialize at $r_\\pm=r_c\\pm \\varepsilon$ with $M(r_\\pm)=1\\pm \\left(\\left.\\dfrac{dM}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}\\right)\\varepsilon$, and integrate outward and inward with an adaptive solver; convert back to $V(r)=c_s M(r)$ as needed for diagnostics.**\n\nThis option describes a mathematically equivalent and equally valid approach using the Mach number. Our derivation confirmed that for $M(r)$, the slope at the critical point is $\\left.\\dfrac{dM}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}=\\pm \\dfrac{1}{r_c}$. Choosing the positive root for the wind is correct. The initialization via Taylor series, $M(r_c \\pm \\varepsilon) = 1 \\pm \\left.\\dfrac{dM}{dr}\\right|_{r_c}\\varepsilon$, is also correct. This represents a complete and robust numerical strategy, identical in principle to that in option A.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
