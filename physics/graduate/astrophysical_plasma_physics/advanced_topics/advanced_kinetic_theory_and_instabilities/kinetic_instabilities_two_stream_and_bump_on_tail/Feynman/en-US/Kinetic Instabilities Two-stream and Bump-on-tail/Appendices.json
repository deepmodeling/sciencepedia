The electric field is purely a perturbation, so $E=E_1$. The equilibrium is characterized by:\n-   Beam 1: $n_{1,0} = n_0/2$, $v_{1,0} = v_0$\n-   Beam 2: $n_{2,0} = n_0/2$, $v_{2,0} = -v_0$\n\nThe linearized equations are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial n_{j,1}}{\\partial t} + n_{j,0} \\frac{\\partial v_{j,1}}{\\partial x} + v_{j,0} \\frac{\\partial n_{j,1}}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial v_{j,1}}{\\partial t} + v_{j,0} \\frac{\\partial v_{j,1}}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{e}{m_e} E_1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{e}{\\varepsilon_0}(n_{1,1} + n_{2,1}) $$\n\nWe assume all perturbed quantities have a plane-wave form proportional to $\\exp(i k x - i \\omega t)$.

The total electron plasma frequency is $\\omega_{p}^{2} = \\omega_{p1}^{2} + \\omega_{p2}^{2} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{e}} e^{2}}{\\varepsilon_{0} m_{\\mathrm{e}}}$, and for equal beams $\\omega_{p1}^{2} = \\omega_{p2}^{2} = \\omega_{p}^{2}/2$.\n\nWe seek unstable solutions with $\\omega = i \\gamma$ and $\\gamma > 0$. For symmetric counter-streams, the most unstable branch is even in frequency and typically has zero real part, $\\omega_{r} = 0$, by symmetry. We thus consider $\\omega = i \\gamma$. In the warm-kinetic formulation,\n$$\n\\varepsilon(i\\gamma,k) = 1 + \\frac{\\omega_{p}^{2}}{2 k^{2} v_{T}^{2}} \\left[1 + \\zeta_{+} Z(\\zeta_{+}) \\right] + \\frac{\\omega_{p}^{2}}{2 k^{2} v_{T}^{2}} \\left[1 + \\zeta_{-} Z(\\zeta_{-}) \\right] = 0,\n$$\nwith\n$$\n\\zeta_{+} = \\frac{i\\gamma - k V_{\\mathrm{d}}}{\\sqrt{2}\\, k v_{T}}, \\quad \\zeta_{-} = \\frac{i\\gamma + k V_{\\mathrm{d}}}{\\sqrt{2}\\, k v_{T}}.\n$$\n\nIn the regime $V_{\\mathrm{d}} \\gg v_{T}$, the dimensionless arguments satisfy $|\\zeta_{\\pm}| \\gg 1$ because $|k V_{\\mathrm{d}}| \\gg k v_{T}$ and typically $|\\gamma| \\lesssim \\omega_{p}$. The asymptotic expansion of the Plasma Dispersion Function for large $|\\zeta|$ is\n$$\nZ(\\zeta) \\sim -\\frac{1}{\\zeta} - \\frac{1}{2 \\zeta^{3}} - \\frac{3}{4 \\zeta^{5}} + \\cdots + i \\sqrt{\\pi} \\exp(-\\zeta^{2}) \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{2 \\zeta^{2}} + \\cdots \\right].\n$$\nInserting this expansion into $1 + \\zeta Z(\\zeta)$ yields\n$$\n1 + \\zeta Z(\\zeta) \\sim -\\frac{1}{2 \\zeta^{2}} - \\frac{3}{4 \\zeta^{4}} + \\cdots + i \\sqrt{\\pi} \\zeta \\exp(-\\zeta^{2}) \\left[ 1 + \\cdots \\right].\n$$\nThe exponentially small imaginary contribution encodes Landau damping (or growth) due to resonant particles; however, when $|\\zeta_{\\pm}| \\gg 1$ with substantial real part, $\\exp(-\\zeta_{\\pm}^{2})$ is vanishingly small and the leading real response reduces to the cold-fluid limit. Using $\\zeta_{j}^{2} = (\\omega - k V_{j})^{2}/(2 k^{2} v_{T}^{2})$, the leading-order susceptibility becomes\n$$\n\\chi_{j}(\\omega,k) \\approx \\frac{\\omega_{pj}^{2}}{k^{2} v_{T}^{2}} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2 \\zeta_{j}^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{\\omega_{pj}^{2}}{(\\omega - k V_{j})^{2}},\n$$\nwhich is precisely the cold-fluid electron susceptibility. Therefore, the kinetic dispersion relation reduces to the cold two-stream form:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(\\omega, k) \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{p1}^{2}}{(\\omega - k V_{1})^{2}} - \\frac{\\omega_{p2}^{2}}{(\\omega - k V_{2})^{2}} = 0.\n$$\nWith $\\omega_{p1}^{2}=\\omega_{p2}^{2}=\\omega_{p}^{2}/2$, $V_1=V_{\\mathrm{d}}$, $V_2=-V_{\\mathrm{d}}$, and setting $\\omega=i\\gamma$ for the purely growing mode:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\omega_{p}^{2}/2}{(i\\gamma - k V_{\\mathrm{d}})^{2}} - \\frac{\\omega_{p}^{2}/2}{(i\\gamma + k V_{\\mathrm{d}})^{2}} = 0.\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{\\omega_{p}^{2}}{2} \\frac{(i\\gamma+kV_{\\mathrm{d}})^2+(i\\gamma-kV_{\\mathrm{d}})^2}{((i\\gamma)^2-(kV_{\\mathrm{d}})^2)^2} = 1 + \\frac{\\omega_{p}^{2}}{2} \\frac{2(-\\gamma^2-k^2V_{\\mathrm{d}}^2)}{(-\\gamma^2+k^2V_{\\mathrm{d}}^2)^2} = 0.\n$$\nThis leads to the same result as the cold-fluid problem (Problem 1): a quartic equation for the frequency whose unstable branch has a maximum growth rate of\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{\\omega_{p}}{2 \\sqrt{2}}.\n$$\n\nWe now evaluate this numerically using the given parameters and verify that $V_{\\mathrm{d}} \\gg v_{T}$ to justify the kinetic-to-cold reduction.
