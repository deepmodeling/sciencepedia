This exercise provides direct practice in applying the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium equation, $\\nabla P = \\vec{J} \\times \\vec{B}$, to a specific and physically plausible scenario. By deriving the pressure profile $P(r)$ that corresponds to a given parabolic current distribution , you will build a concrete, quantitative understanding of how self-generated magnetic fields can structure and confine a plasma column.",

This practice  simplifies the current profile to be uniform, allowing for a straightforward calculation of the total thermal energy $U_{th}$ and magnetic energy $U_B$ stored within the plasma column.
