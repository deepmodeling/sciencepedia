This exercise delves into the heart of this magnetohydrostatic equilibrium by posing a fundamental design question: for a given plasma pressure distribution, what magnetic field and current profiles are required for confinement? By starting with an intuitive parabolic pressure profile, you will work backward to derive the self-consistent current density and magnetic field, revealing the foundational structure of the classic Bennett Z-pinch.

The term $\\frac{2C}{r^{2}}$ would diverge as $r \\to 0$ unless $C=0$. Setting $C=0$ ensures finite energy density and also satisfies the provided condition $B_{\\theta}(0)=0$.

The analysis will be performed under the assumptions of ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), neglecting plasma pressure and flow. The stability is therefore determined by the magnetic field configuration alone.\n\nFirst, we establish the components of the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$. The field is composed of an externally imposed uniform axial component, $B_z\\hat{z}$, and an azimuthal component, $B_{\\theta}(r)\\hat{\\theta}$, generated by the total axial current $I$.

This implies $dr = 0$, meaning that the magnetic field lines lie on cylindrical surfaces of constant radius. We are particularly interested in the field lines at the plasma-vacuum interface, $r=a$, as their geometry governs the stability against external kink modes. For a field line at $r=a$, the equation reduces to:\n$$\n\\frac{a d\\theta}{B_{\\theta}(a)} = \\frac{dz}{B_z}\n$$\nThis equation describes the pitch of the helical field lines.
