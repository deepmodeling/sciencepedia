            "solution": "The problem asks for the adiabatic deceleration of energetic protons in the expanding Solar wind. This process is governed by the principles of cosmic ray transport in a compressible plasma flow. We begin with the fundamental equation describing the rate of change of momentum, $p$, for a particle in an isotropic distribution being convected in a plasma flow with velocity field $\\vec{V}$. This equation is derived from the Parker transport equation under the conditions specified (neglecting diffusion, drifts, and other energy change mechanisms).\n\nThe rate of change of a particle's momentum due to the expansion or compression of the plasma is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = - \\frac{p}{3} (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V})\n$$\nThis equation describes adiabatic energy changes, where a positive divergence ($\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V}  0$) corresponding to an expanding flow leads to a decrease in momentum (deceleration or cooling).\n\nThe problem specifies the Solar wind as a steady, spherically symmetric, purely radial outflow of constant speed, which we shall denote as $V$.
