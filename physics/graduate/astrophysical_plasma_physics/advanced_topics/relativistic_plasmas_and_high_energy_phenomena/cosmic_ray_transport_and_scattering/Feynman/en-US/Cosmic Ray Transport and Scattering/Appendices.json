            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the mean residence time and grammage for a cosmic ray (CR) in a one-dimensional halo model with diffusion and advection.\n\nThe mean residence time $T(z)$ for a CR starting at position $z$ to reach the escape boundary at $z=H$ is synonymous with the mean first passage time. For a one-dimensional stochastic process described by advection and diffusion, the mean exit time $T(z)$ from a domain $[0, H]$ is governed by the backward Kolmogorov equation. The generator $\\mathcal{L}$ for the process $dZ_t = V dt + \\sqrt{2D(E)} dW_t$ is $\\mathcal{L} = V \\frac{d}{dz} + D(E) \\frac{d^2}{dz^2}$. The mean exit time $T(z)$ satisfies the ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\nD(E) \\frac{d^2T}{dz^2} + V \\frac{dT}{dz} = -1\n$$\nHere, $D(E)$ and $V$ are treated as constants with respect to $z$.\n\nThe boundary conditions on $T(z)$ are derived from the physical nature of the boundaries:\n1. At the absorbing boundary $z=H$, the particle escapes, so the time to escape from this point is zero: $T(H) = 0$.\n2. At the reflecting boundary $z=0$, the correct condition for the mean exit time is a zero-gradient (Neumann) condition: $\\frac{dT}{dz}(0) = 0$.\n\nWe proceed to solve this second-order linear ODE with constant coefficients.

The problem asks to show how advection reduces residence time at low energies, where scattering is strong and $D(E)$ is small. This corresponds to the limit where the Péclet number $Pe \\equiv \\frac{VH}{D(E)} \\gg 1$.\nIn this limit, the term $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{VH}{D(E)}\\right) \\to 0$.

In contrast, the advective time $T_{\\mathrm{adv}} \\approx \\frac{H}{V}$ is a smaller, constant value. The condition that advection dominates, $\\frac{VH}{D(E)} \\gg 1$, can be rewritten as $\\frac{H}{V} \\ll \\frac{H^2}{D(E)}$, which clearly implies that $T_{\\mathrm{adv}} \\ll T_{\\mathrm{diff}}$.\nThus, the presence of a convective wind dramatically reduces the cosmic ray residence time at low energies where diffusive transport is slow.\nThe dimensional analysis $[\\rho][v][T] = (\\mathrm{ML^{-3}})(\\mathrm{LT^{-1}})(\\mathrm{T}) = \\mathrm{ML^{-2}}$ confirms the final expression for $X(E)$ has units of grammage (mass per area).",

The velocity difference is $u_1 - u_2 = u_1 - u_1/4 = \\frac{3}{4} u_1$.\nThe downstream diffusion coefficient is related to the upstream one by $D_2(E) = D_1(E)/r = D_1(E)/4$.\n\nSubstituting these relations into the expression for $t_{\\mathrm{acc}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{acc}}(E) = \\frac{3}{\\frac{3}{4}u_1} \\left( \\frac{D_1(E)}{u_1} + \\frac{D_1(E)/4}{u_1/4} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{acc}}(E) = \\frac{4}{u_1} \\left( \\frac{D_1(E)}{u_1} + \\frac{D_1(E)}{u_1} \\right) = \\frac{4}{u_1} \\left( \\frac{2 D_1(E)}{u_1} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{acc}}(E) = \\frac{8 D_1(E)}{u_1^2}\n$$\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the given numerical values. The upstream diffusion coefficient's energy dependence is given by:\n$$\nD_1(E) = D_0 \\left(\\frac{E}{E_0}\\right)^{\\delta}\n$$\nwith $D_0 = 3.0 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2\\,s^{-1}}$, $E_0 = 1\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, and $\\delta=1$. We need to evaluate this at $E = 10\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$:\n$$\nD_1(10\\,\\mathrm{GeV}) = (3.0 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2\\,s^{-1}}) \\left(\\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{GeV}}{1\\,\\mathrm{GeV}}\\right)^{1} = 3.0 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nThe upstream flow speed is $u_1 = 5.0 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the acceleration time in seconds:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{acc}}(10\\,\\mathrm{GeV}) = \\frac{8 \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2\\,s^{-1}})}{(5.0 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,s^{-1}})^2} = \\frac{24.0 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2\\,s^{-1}}}{25.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2\\,s^{-2}}}\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{acc}} = \\frac{24.0}{25.0} \\times 10^{23-16}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.96 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s} = 9.6 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nFinally, we convert this result to years, using the conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{yr} = 3.154 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{acc}} (\\mathrm{in\\,years}) = \\frac{9.6 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s}}{3.154 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s/yr}} \\approx 0.3043754\\,\\mathrm{yr}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.3044$ years.",
