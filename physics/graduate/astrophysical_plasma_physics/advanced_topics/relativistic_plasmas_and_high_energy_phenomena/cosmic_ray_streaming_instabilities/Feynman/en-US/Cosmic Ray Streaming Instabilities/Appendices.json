To master this topic, we must first understand the precise conditions under which a particle and a wave can remain in phase to exchange energy.

Mastering this derivation provides a deep understanding of the kinetic microphysics that underpins the growth of these crucial astrophysical instabilities.",

            "problem": "A dilute population of relativistic cosmic-ray ions of charge $q0$ and rest mass $m$ streams through a uniform magnetized background plasma with a uniform background magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_{0}=B_{0}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. Consider a small-amplitude, monochromatic plane electromagnetic wave of angular frequency $\\omega$ and wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$, propagating obliquely in the $x$–$z$ plane at an angle $\\theta\\in(0,\\pi/2)$ with respect to $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$, so that $k_{\\parallel}=k\\cos\\theta$ and $k_{\\perp}=k\\sin\\theta$, where $k=|\\mathbf{k}|$. A test cosmic-ray ion has speed $v$, Lorentz factor $\\gamma=(1-v^{2}/c^{2})^{-1/2}$, and pitch angle $\\alpha$ (the angle between $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$), with pitch-angle cosine $\\mu=\\cos\\alpha=v_{\\parallel}/v$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the cyclotron resonance condition for a relativistic charged particle interacting with a plane electromagnetic wave in a uniform magnetic field, and then solving for the resonant pitch-angle cosine. The derivation must start from first principles.\n\nLet the uniform background magnetic field be $\\mathbf{B}_{0} = B_{0}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. A cosmic-ray ion with charge $q > 0$ and rest mass $m$ moves in this field. In the absence of any other forces, the particle's motion is governed by the Lorentz force equation, $d\\mathbf{p}/dt = (q/c)\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}_{0}$, where $\\mathbf{p} = m\\gamma\\mathbf{v}$ is the relativistic momentum and $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor. The velocity of the particle $\\mathbf{v}$ can be decomposed into a component parallel to $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$, $v_{\\parallel}$, which is constant, and a component perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}$, which rotates at the relativistic gyrofrequency $\\Omega_{rel} = qB_{0}/(m\\gamma c)$. The nonrelativistic gyrofrequency is given as $\\Omega = qB_{0}/(mc)$, so we have $\\Omega_{rel} = \\Omega/\\gamma$. The particle executes a helical trajectory. The position of the particle at time $t$ can be written as $\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r}_{gc}(t) + \\boldsymbol{\\rho}(t)$, where $\\mathbf{r}_{gc}(t)$ is the guiding center position moving with velocity $v_{\\parallel}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}(t)$ is the gyration vector in the plane perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$. The magnitude of the gyroradius is $\\rho_L = v_{\\perp}/\\Omega_{rel}$. Let the gyrophase be $\\phi(t) = \\Omega_{rel}t + \\phi_0$. We can write the particle's velocity and position (with a suitable choice of coordinates and initial conditions) as:\n$v_{\\parallel} = v \\mu = v \\cos\\alpha$\n$v_{\\perp} = v \\sqrt{1-\\mu^2} = v \\sin\\alpha$\n$\\mathbf{v}(t) = (v_{\\perp}\\cos\\phi(t), -v_{\\perp}\\sin\\phi(t), v_{\\parallel})$\n$\\mathbf{r}(t) = (\\rho_L \\sin\\phi(t) + x_{gc}, \\rho_L \\cos\\phi(t) + y_{gc}, v_{\\parallel}t + z_0)$\n\nNow, consider a small-amplitude plane electromagnetic wave with electric field $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\mathbf{E}_{0} \\exp[i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega t)]$ and magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency and $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector. The wave propagates in the $x$-$z$ plane, so $\\mathbf{k} = k_{\\perp}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k_{\\parallel}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, with $k_{\\perp} = k\\sin\\theta$ and $k_{\\parallel} = k\\cos\\theta$.\n\nA sustained, coherent energy exchange between the wave and the particle, which defines resonance, occurs when the particle experiences a force that is persistently in or out of phase with its velocity. This requires a phase-locking between the particle's motion and the wave it experiences. The particle at position $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ sees a wave with phase $\\Phi(t) = \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t) - \\omega t$. To analyze the interaction, we expand the wave field experienced by the particle into its frequency components. The phase is:\n$$ \\Phi(t) = k_{\\perp}x(t) + k_{\\parallel}z(t) - \\omega t $$\n$$ \\Phi(t) = k_{\\perp}(\\rho_L \\sin\\phi(t) + x_{gc}) + k_{\\parallel}(v_{\\parallel}t + z_0) - \\omega t $$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$ \\Phi(t) = (k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} - \\omega)t + k_{\\perp}\\rho_L\\sin\\phi(t) + (k_{\\perp}x_{gc} + k_{\\parallel}z_0) $$\nThe term $k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel}$ represents the Doppler shift of the wave frequency due to the particle's parallel motion. The frequency seen by an observer moving with the particle's guiding center is $\\omega' = \\omega - k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel}$.\n\nThe full wave field experienced by the particle is proportional to $\\exp[i\\Phi(t)]$. The term involving $\\sin\\phi(t)$ is periodic. We can use the Jacobi-Anger expansion to decompose this part of the phase into a sum over harmonics of the gyromotion:\n$$ e^{i z \\sin\\phi} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} J_n(z) e^{in\\phi} $$\nwhere $J_n(z)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order $n$, and the argument is $z = k_{\\perp}\\rho_L = k_{\\perp}v_{\\perp}/\\Omega_{rel}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the wave phase, the wave field experienced by the particle can be expressed as a superposition of modes:\n$$ e^{i\\Phi(t)} = \\left( \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} J_n(k_{\\perp}\\rho_L) e^{in\\phi(t)} \\right) e^{i(k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} - \\omega)t + i\\phi_{const}} $$\nwhere $\\phi_{const}$ contains the constant phase terms. Since $\\phi(t) = \\Omega_{rel}t + \\phi_0$, this becomes:\n$$ e^{i\\Phi(t)} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} J_n(k_{\\perp}\\rho_L) e^{i(k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} - \\omega + n\\Omega_{rel})t + in\\phi_0 + i\\phi_{const}} $$\nThis shows that the particle interacts not with a single frequency $\\omega$, but with a spectrum of frequencies Doppler-shifted by its parallel motion and broken into cyclotron harmonics $n$ by its perpendicular motion. Each integer $n$ corresponds to a harmonic of the interaction. The integer $n=0$ corresponds to the Landau resonance, while $n \\neq 0$ correspond to the cyclotron resonances.\n\nResonance occurs when the particle sees a static field in its oscillating frame for one of these harmonics. This means the phase of one of the harmonic components must be stationary. The \"interaction phase\" for the $n$-th harmonic is $\\Psi_n(t) = (k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} - \\omega + n\\Omega_{rel})t + \\text{constants}$.\nThe condition for resonance is that the time derivative of this phase is zero:\n$$ \\frac{d\\Psi_n}{dt} = 0 $$\n$$ k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} - \\omega + n\\Omega_{rel} = 0 $$\nThis gives the fundamental cyclotron resonance condition:\n$$ \\omega - k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} = n\\Omega_{rel} $$\n\nThis condition has a clear physical interpretation. The left side, $\\omega - k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel}$, is the wave frequency as seen in the reference frame of the particle's guiding center. The right side, $n\\Omega_{rel}$, is an integer multiple of the particle's relativistic gyrofrequency. Resonance occurs when the Doppler-shifted wave frequency matches an integer multiple of the particle's orbital frequency. This allows for a persistent, cumulative transfer of energy between the wave and the particle. The question asks why only the parallel component of the Doppler shift, $k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel}$, survives. The full Doppler shift would be $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} + \\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}(t)$. The perpendicular term $\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}$ oscillates at the gyrofrequency. Its effect is not averaged to zero; rather, its periodic nature is what gives rise to the spectrum of cyclotron harmonics $n$. The process of expanding the interaction into Fourier harmonics (the Jacobi-Anger expansion) effectively performs the \"gyro-phase averaging\" by separating the interaction into components that can lead to secular (long-term) effects. The parallel Doppler shift $k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel}$, being constant, provides a uniform shift to all harmonics.\n\nNow, we solve the resonance condition for the pitch-angle cosine, $\\mu_n(\\theta)$. We substitute the given definitions into the resonance equation $\\omega - k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} - n\\Omega_{rel} = 0$:\n-   Parallel wavevector: $k_{\\parallel} = k \\cos\\theta$\n-   Parallel particle velocity: $v_{\\parallel} = v \\mu$\n-   Relativistic gyrofrequency: $\\Omega_{rel} = \\Omega/\\gamma$\n\nThe resonance condition becomes:\n$$ \\omega - (k \\cos\\theta)(v \\mu) - n\\frac{\\Omega}{\\gamma} = 0 $$\nWe are asked to find the resonant pitch-angle cosine, which we denote as $\\mu_n(\\theta)$ to emphasize its dependence on the harmonic number $n$ and the wave propagation angle $\\theta$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $\\mu$:\n$$ (k v \\cos\\theta) \\mu = \\omega - n\\frac{\\Omega}{\\gamma} $$\nAssuming $k v \\cos\\theta \\neq 0$ (which is true since $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, $k \\neq 0$, and $v \\neq 0$), we can divide to find $\\mu_n(\\theta)$:\n$$ \\mu_{n}(\\theta) = \\frac{\\omega - \\frac{n\\Omega}{\\gamma}}{k v \\cos\\theta} $$\nThis is the final expression for the resonant pitch-angle cosine for the $n$-th harmonic. For a resonance to be physically possible for a particle with total speed $v$, the required parallel speed $v_{\\parallel} = v\\mu_n(\\theta)$ must not exceed $v$. This implies that the magnitude of the pitch-angle cosine must be less than or equal to $1$, i.e., $|\\mu_n(\\theta)| \\le 1$.",

First, to derive the energy partition between magnetic fluctuations and plasma bulk motions for Alfvén waves using the ideal-MHD equations. Second, to compute the fraction of cosmic ray (CR) energy loss that is converted into magnetic energy density at the saturation of the CR streaming instability, under the specified assumptions.\n\nLet us begin by analyzing the properties of linear, transverse, incompressible Alfvén waves in a uniform plasma with mass density $\\rho$ and background magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_{0} = B_{0}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. We consider small perturbations $\\delta\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\delta\\mathbf{B}$ to a static background ($\\mathbf{u}_{0} = 0$).

This completes the first part of the derivation.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must compute the fraction of the CR energy loss converted into magnetic energy density at saturation.\nThe problem states that at saturation, \"the energy transferred from the CR anisotropy is entirely stored in the Alfvénic fluctuations.\" Let $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{CR}}$ be the energy density lost by the CRs.

Derivation for the Specific Case $s=4$**\n\nFor the specific case $s=4$, the integrals become:\n$$n_{\\rm cr} = 4\\pi A \\int_{p_{\\min}}^{p_{\\max}} p^{-2} dp = 4\\pi A \\left[ -p^{-1} \\right]_{p_{\\min}}^{p_{\\max}} = 4\\pi A \\left( \\frac{1}{p_{\\min}} - \\frac{1}{p_{\\max}} \\right)$$\n$$U_{\\rm cr} = 4\\pi A c \\int_{p_{\\min}}^{p_{\\max}} p^{-1} dp = 4\\pi A c \\left[ \\ln(p) \\right]_{p_{\\min}}^{p_{\\max}} = 4\\pi A c \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\max}}{p_{\\min}}\\right)$$\nWe can solve for the term $4\\pi A$ from the expression for $n_{\\rm cr}$:\n$$4\\pi A = \\frac{n_{\\rm cr}}{p_{\\min}^{-1} - p_{\\max}^{-1}}$$\nNow substitute this into the expression for $U_{\\rm cr}$:\n$$U_{\\rm cr} = \\left( \\frac{n_{\\rm cr}}{p_{\\min}^{-1} - p_{\\max}^{-1}} \\right) c \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\max}}{p_{\\min}}\\right) = n_{\\rm cr} c \\frac{\\ln(p_{\\max}/p_{\\min})}{1/p_{\\min} - 1/p_{\\max}}$$\nSimplifying the denominator gives:\n$$U_{\\rm cr} = n_{\\rm cr} c \\frac{p_{\\min} p_{\\max}}{p_{\\max} - p_{\\min}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\max}}{p_{\\min}}\\right)$$\nThis is the expression for the CR energy density for the $s=4$ case. Since $p_{\\max} \\gg p_{\\min}$, we can approximate $p_{\\max} - p_{\\min} \\approx p_{\\max}$, which simplifies the expression to $U_{\\rm cr} \\approx n_{\\rm cr} c p_{\\min} \\ln(p_{\\max}/p_{\\min})$. We will use the full expression for better accuracy.\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe task is to find $\\epsilon = u_B / U_{\\rm cr}$. We calculate $u_B$ and $U_{\\rm cr}$ separately using the given values in CGS units.\n\n*   **Magnetic Energy Density ($u_B$)**:\n    Given $\\delta B = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{G} = 100 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{G} = 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{G}$.\n    $$u_B = \\frac{(\\delta B)^2}{8\\pi} = \\frac{(10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{G})^2}{8\\pi} = \\frac{10^{-8}}{8\\pi} \\frac{\\mathrm{erg}}{\\mathrm{cm}^3} \\approx 3.9789 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{erg}}{\\mathrm{cm}^3}$$\n\n*   **Cosmic Ray Energy Density ($U_{\\rm cr}$)**:\n    Given parameters:\n    $n_{\\rm cr} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n    $p_{\\min} = m_p c$, $p_{\\max} = 10^5 m_p c$\n    Proton rest mass $m_p \\approx 1.6726 \\times 10^{-24}\\ \\mathrm{g}$\n    Speed of light $c \\approx 2.9979 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}$\n\n    First, let's calculate the ratio of momenta and its logarithm:\n    $\\frac{p_{\\max}}{p_{\\min}} = \\frac{10^5 m_p c}{m_p c} = 10^5$\n    $\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\max}}{p_{\\min}}\\right) = \\ln(10^5) = 5 \\ln(10) \\approx 11.5129$\n\n    The factor $\\frac{p_{\\max}}{p_{\\max} - p_{\\min}} = \\frac{10^5 m_p c}{10^5 m_p c - m_p c} = \\frac{10^5}{99999} \\approx 1.00001$.\n\n    The proton rest energy is $m_p c^2 \\approx (1.6726 \\times 10^{-24}\\ \\mathrm{g})(2.9979 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm/s})^2 \\approx 1.5033 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{erg}$.\n\n    Now we can compute $U_{\\rm cr}$:\n    $$U_{\\rm cr} = n_{\\rm cr} (m_p c^2) \\frac{p_{\\max}}{p_{\\max} - p_{\\min}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\max}}{p_{\\min}}\\right)$$\n    $$U_{\\rm cr} \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) \\times (1.5033 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{erg}) \\times (1.00001) \\times (11.5129)$$\n    $$U_{\\rm cr} \\approx 1.7306 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{erg}}{\\mathrm{cm}^3}$$\n\n*   **Calculate $\\epsilon$**:\n    Now we compute the ratio $\\epsilon = u_B / U_{\\rm cr}$.\n    $$\\epsilon = \\frac{3.9789 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{erg/cm}^3}{1.7306 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{erg/cm}^3} \\approx 0.02299$$\n\n**4.
