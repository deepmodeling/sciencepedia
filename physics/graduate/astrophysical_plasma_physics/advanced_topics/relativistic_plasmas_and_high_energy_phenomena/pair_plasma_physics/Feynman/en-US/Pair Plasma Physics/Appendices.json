In many astrophysical settings, these plasmas are hot enough for particle speeds to approach the speed of light, rendering the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution insufficient.

            "problem": "An optically thin, collisionally equilibrated electron–positron pair plasma in an astrophysical jet segment is well described by the classical relativistic Maxwell–Jüttner distribution. Each species (electrons and positrons) has rest mass $m_e$ and shares a common temperature $T$, with the dimensionless temperature defined by $\\Theta = k_B T/(m_e c^2)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $c$ is the speed of light. Assume the momentum distribution is isotropic and nondegenerate. The one-particle distribution function in momentum space for either species can be written as $f(\\mathbf{p}) = A \\exp(-\\gamma(\\mathbf{p})/\\Theta)$, where $\\gamma(\\mathbf{p}) = \\sqrt{1 + p^2/(m_e^2 c^2)}$ is the Lorentz factor associated with momentum magnitude $p = |\\mathbf{p}|$, and $A$ is a normalization constant determined by the number density $n$ of the species.\n\nStarting from first principles of relativistic kinetic theory (proper phase-space measure and normalization), compute the mean Lorentz factor $\\langle \\gamma \\rangle$ of either species as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\Theta$ and well-defined special functions only.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in relativistic kinetic theory. We are asked to compute the mean Lorentz factor $\\langle \\gamma \\rangle$ for a species in a relativistic thermal plasma described by the Maxwell–Jüttner distribution.\n\nThe one-particle distribution function is given as $f(\\mathbf{p}) = A \\exp(-\\gamma(\\mathbf{p})/\\Theta)$, where $\\gamma(\\mathbf{p}) = \\sqrt{1 + p^2/(m_e^2 c^2)}$ is the Lorentz factor, $p = |\\mathbf{p}|$ is the momentum magnitude, and $\\Theta = k_B T/(m_e c^2)$ is the dimensionless temperature. The constant $A$ is for normalization.\n\nThe mean value of any quantity $Q(\\mathbf{p})$ is calculated by averaging over the distribution in momentum space:\n$$\n\\langle Q \\rangle = \\frac{\\int Q(\\mathbf{p}) f(\\mathbf{p}) d^3p}{\\int f(\\mathbf{p}) d^3p}\n$$\nFor the mean Lorentz factor, $Q(\\mathbf{p}) = \\gamma(\\mathbf{p})$. Substituting the distribution function, the normalization constant $A$ cancels out:\n$$\n\\langle \\gamma \\rangle = \\frac{\\int \\gamma(\\mathbf{p}) \\exp(-\\gamma(\\mathbf{p})/\\Theta) d^3p}{\\int \\exp(-\\gamma(\\mathbf{p})/\\Theta) d^3p}\n$$\nSince the distribution is isotropic, the integrands depend only on the momentum magnitude $p$. We can switch to spherical coordinates in momentum space, where the volume element is $d^3p = 4\\pi p^2 dp$. The integrals become:\n$$\n\\langle \\gamma \\rangle = \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty \\gamma(p) \\exp(-\\gamma(p)/\\Theta) 4\\pi p^2 dp}{\\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-\\gamma(p)/\\Theta) 4\\pi p^2 dp} = \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty \\gamma(p) \\exp(-\\gamma(p)/\\Theta) p^2 dp}{\\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-\\gamma(p)/\\Theta) p^2 dp}\n$$\nTo evaluate these integrals, it is convenient to change the integration variable from momentum $p$ to the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$. The relationship is $\\gamma^2 = 1 + p^2/(m_e^2 c^2)$.\nFrom this, we derive the following relations:\n$p^2 = m_e^2 c^2 (\\gamma^2 - 1)$, which implies $p = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\nDifferentiating $p^2$ with respect to $\\gamma$:\n$2p \\frac{dp}{d\\gamma} = m_e^2 c^2 (2\\gamma) \\implies p \\, dp = m_e^2 c^2 \\gamma \\, d\\gamma$.\nThe term $p^2 dp$ in the integral can be rewritten as:\n$p^2 dp = p(p \\, dp) = \\left(m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}\\right) \\left(m_e^2 c^2 \\gamma \\, d\\gamma\\right) = (m_e c)^3 \\gamma \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\, d\\gamma$.\nThe limits of integration for $p$ from $0$ to $\\infty$ correspond to $\\gamma$ from $1$ to $\\infty$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\langle \\gamma \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle \\gamma \\rangle = \\frac{\\int_1^\\infty \\gamma \\exp(-\\gamma/\\Theta) \\left( (m_e c)^3 \\gamma \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\right) d\\gamma}{\\int_1^\\infty \\exp(-\\gamma/\\Theta) \\left( (m_e c)^3 \\gamma \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\right) d\\gamma}\n$$\nThe constant factor $(m_e c)^3$ cancels out.

A key integral representation is:\n$$\n\\int_1^\\infty (x^2-1)^{\\nu - 1/2} \\exp(-zx) dx = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\nu+1/2)}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left(\\frac{2}{z}\\right)^\\nu K_\\nu(z)\n$$\nOur integrals have an extra factor of $\\gamma^k$. We can handle this by differentiation with respect to $z$. Consider the integral $I(z) = \\int_1^\\infty \\sqrt{x^2-1} \\exp(-zx) dx$.\nFrom the formula above with $\\nu-1/2 = 1/2 \\implies \\nu=1$:\n$I(z) = \\frac{\\Gamma(3/2)}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left(\\frac{2}{z}\\right)^1 K_1(z) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}/2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\frac{2}{z} K_1(z) = \\frac{K_1(z)}{z}$.\n\nThe integrals we need are of the form $\\int_1^\\infty \\gamma^k \\sqrt{\\gamma^2-1} \\exp(-z\\gamma) d\\gamma$. Note that $\\gamma^k \\exp(-z\\gamma) = (-1)^k \\frac{d^k}{dz^k} \\exp(-z\\gamma)$.\nThe denominator integral is:\n$$\nD(z) = \\int_1^\\infty \\gamma \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\exp(-z \\gamma) d\\gamma = -\\frac{d}{dz} \\int_1^\\infty \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\exp(-z \\gamma) d\\gamma = -\\frac{d}{dz} \\left(\\frac{K_1(z)}{z}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the differentiation identity for Bessel functions, $\\frac{d}{dz}(z^{-\\nu} K_\\nu(z)) = -z^{-\\nu} K_{\\nu+1}(z)$, with $\\nu=1$:\n$$\nD(z) = -\\left(-z^{-1} K_2(z)\\right) = \\frac{K_2(z)}{z}\n$$\nThe numerator integral is:\n$$\nN(z) = \\int_1^\\infty \\gamma^2 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\exp(-z \\gamma) d\\gamma = (-1)^2 \\frac{d^2}{dz^2} \\left(\\frac{K_1(z)}{z}\\right) = \\frac{d}{dz} \\left(-\\frac{K_2(z)}{z}\\right) = -\\frac{d}{dz}\\left(z^{-1} K_2(z)\\right)\n$$\nWe compute this derivative explicitly:\n$$\n-\\frac{d}{dz}\\left(z^{-1} K_2(z)\\right) = - \\left( -z^{-2}K_2(z) + z^{-1}K'_2(z) \\right) = z^{-2}K_2(z) - z^{-1}K'_2(z)\n$$\nUsing the recurrence relation $K'_\\nu(z) = -K_{\\nu-1}(z) - \\frac{\\nu}{z}K_\\nu(z)$ for $\\nu=2$:\n$K'_2(z) = -K_1(z) - \\frac{2}{z}K_2(z)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $N(z)$:\n$$\nN(z) = z^{-2}K_2(z) - z^{-1}\\left(-K_1(z) - \\frac{2}{z}K_2(z)\\right) = z^{-2}K_2(z) + z^{-1}K_1(z) + 2z^{-2}K_2(z) = \\frac{3}{z^2}K_2(z) + \\frac{1}{z}K_1(z)\n$$\nNow, we compute the ratio $\\langle \\gamma \\rangle = N(z)/D(z)$:\n$$\n\\langle \\gamma \\rangle = \\frac{\\frac{3}{z^2}K_2(z) + \\frac{1}{z}K_1(z)}{\\frac{K_2(z)}{z}} = \\frac{3}{z} + \\frac{K_1(z)}{K_2(z)}\n$$\nSubstituting back $z = 1/\\Theta$:\n$$\n\\langle \\gamma \\rangle = 3\\Theta + \\frac{K_1(1/\\Theta)}{K_2(1/\\Theta)}\n$$\nThis is the exact closed-form analytic expression for the mean Lorentz factor.\n\nNext, we analyze the asymptotic limits.\n1.  **Nonrelativistic limit**: $\\Theta \\ll 1$, which means $z = 1/\\Theta \\gg 1$.\n    The asymptotic expansion of $K_\\nu(z)$ for large $z$ is $K_\\nu(z) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2z}}\\exp(-z)(1 + \\frac{4\\nu^2-1}{8z} + O(z^{-2}))$.\n    The ratio becomes:\n    $$\n    \\frac{K_1(z)}{K_2(z)} \\sim \\frac{1 + \\frac{4(1)^2-1}{8z}}{1 + \\frac{4(2)^2-1}{8z}} = \\frac{1 + 3/(8z)}{1 + 15/(8z)} \\approx \\left(1 + \\frac{3}{8z}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{15}{8z}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\frac{12}{8z} = 1 - \\frac{3}{2z}\n    $$\n    Substituting this into the expression for $\\langle \\gamma \\rangle$ with $z=1/\\Theta$:\n    $$\n    \\langle \\gamma \\rangle \\approx 3\\Theta + \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{2}\\Theta\\right) = 1 + \\frac{3}{2}\\Theta\n    $$\n    Physically, the mean kinetic energy is $\\langle E_k \\rangle = (\\langle \\gamma \\rangle-1)m_e c^2 \\approx (\\frac{3}{2}\\Theta)m_e c^2 = \\frac{3}{2}k_B T$.

It is derived from Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential $\\Phi$:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\Phi = -\\frac{\\rho_{\\text{total}}}{\\epsilon_0} $$\nFor a small perturbation around a neutral background, the total charge density $\\rho_{\\text{total}}$ is the induced charge density $\\delta\\rho$. The problem specifies using the linearized thermodynamic response. For a particle species $j$ with charge $q_j$ and unperturbed number density $n_{j0}$ at temperature $T$, the density perturbation $\\delta n_j$ due to a weak potential $\\Phi$ is given by the linearized Boltzmann factor:\n$$ \\delta n_j = n_j - n_{j0} \\approx n_{j0} \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q_j \\Phi}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\approx -\\frac{n_{j0} q_j \\Phi}{k_B T} $$\nThis relation holds for the static response in the low-potential limit ($|q_j \\Phi| \\ll k_B T$) for both non-relativistic and relativistic thermal distributions. The induced charge density is the sum over all species:\n$$ \\delta\\rho = \\sum_j q_j \\delta n_j = \\sum_j q_j \\left( -\\frac{n_{j0} q_j \\Phi}{k_B T} \\right) = - \\left( \\sum_j \\frac{n_{j0} q_j^2}{k_B T} \\right) \\Phi $$\nFor the electron-positron pair plasma, we have electrons ($j=e$) and positrons ($j=p$) with $n_{e0}=n_{p0}=n/2$ and $q_e^2=q_p^2=e^2$. The sum becomes:\n$$ \\sum_j \\frac{n_{j0} q_j^2}{k_B T} = \\frac{(n/2)e^2}{k_B T} + \\frac{(n/2)e^2}{k_B T} = \\frac{n e^2}{k_B T} $$\nSubstituting this into Poisson's equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\Phi = -\\frac{\\delta\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{n e^2}{k_B T} \\right) \\Phi $$\nThis is the screened Poisson equation, which can be written as $\\nabla^2 \\Phi = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2}\\Phi$. By comparison, the Debye screening length squared is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2} = \\frac{n e^2}{\\epsilon_0 k_B T} $$\nThus, the expression for the Debye length is:\n$$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T}{n e^2}} $$\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of Plasma Period $\\tau_{p}$\n\nThe plasma period $\\tau_p$ is related to the plasma frequency $\\omega_p$ by $\\tau_p = 2\\pi/\\omega_p$.

The concepts of gradient drift, curvature drift, and their relativistic generalizations are standard in this field. The form of the toroidal magnetic field, $B \\propto 1/R$, is a standard model.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for a specific, computable quantity (magnitude of the current density) at a specific location, given a complete set of parameters and physical constants. A unique solution exists.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective scientific language.\n4.  **Consistency Check**:\n    -   The problem states that the $\\nabla B$ and curvature drifts are co-directed. Let's verify this. The magnetic field is $\\boldsymbol{B} = B(R)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}$. The unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field is $\\boldsymbol{b} = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}$.\n    -   The gradient of the magnetic field strength is $\\nabla B = \\nabla \\left(B_0 \\frac{R_0}{R}\\right) = B_0 R_0 \\nabla\\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\right) = B_0 R_0 \\left(-\\frac{1}{R^2}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{R}}\\right) = -\\frac{B(R)}{R}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{R}}$. The gradient $\\nabla B$ points radially inward.\n    -   The curvature vector of the field lines is $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = (\\boldsymbol{b} \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{b}$. In cylindrical coordinates, with $\\boldsymbol{b} = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}$, this becomes $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = \\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}\\right)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} = \\frac{1}{R}(-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{R}}) = -\\frac{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{R}}}{R}$. The curvature vector also points radially inward.\n    -   The gradient drift velocity is proportional to $\\boldsymbol{B} \\times \\nabla B$, which has direction $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} \\times (-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{R}}) = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$.\n    -   The curvature drift velocity is proportional to $\\boldsymbol{b} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$. This has direction $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} \\times (-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{R}}) = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$.\n    -   Both drift vectors point in the $+\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$ direction for a positive charge $q$. So, the assumption that they are co-directed is correct.\n    -   The provided physical constants are the accepted CODATA values. The parameters for the magnetic field, density, and particle velocities are within plausible ranges for extreme astrophysical environments like pulsar magnetospheres.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, self-contained, consistent, and well-posed.\n\nThe net current density $\\boldsymbol{J}$ is the sum of the current densities from the positrons ($s=+$) and electrons ($s=-$). For consistency with the definition in Problem 2, the total number density is $n$, so the density of each species is $n_e = n_p = n/2$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{J} = n_{p} q_{p} \\boldsymbol{v}_{d,+} + n_{e} q_{e} \\boldsymbol{v}_{d,-}\n$$\nWith $n_{p} = n_{e} = n/2$, $q_{p} = +e$, and $q_{e} = -e$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{J} = \\frac{n}{2}(e)\\boldsymbol{v}_{d,+} + \\frac{n}{2}(-e)\\boldsymbol{v}_{d,-} = \\frac{ne}{2}(\\boldsymbol{v}_{d,+} - \\boldsymbol{v}_{d,-})\n$$\nThe total drift velocity $\\boldsymbol{v}_d$ for a particle of charge $q$ is the sum of the gradient drift $\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\nabla B}$ and the curvature drift $\\boldsymbol{v}_{c}$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{v}_d = \\boldsymbol{v}_{\\nabla B} + \\boldsymbol{v}_{c}\n$$\nThe non-relativistic expressions for the magnitudes of these drifts in a toroidal field with radius of curvature $R$ are:\n$$\n|\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\nabla B}| = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2|q|BR} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |\\boldsymbol{v}_{c}| = \\frac{m v_{\\parallel}^2}{|q|BR}\n$$\nSince they are co-directed, the magnitude of the total drift is:\n$$\n|\\boldsymbol{v}_d| = \\frac{m}{|q|BR} \\left(v_{\\parallel}^2 + \\frac{v_{\\perp}^2}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe provided magnetic field is curl-free ($\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B} = \\boldsymbol{0}$), so the combined drift formula is appropriate.\n\nThe problem requires a relativistic treatment by replacing mass $m$ with $\\gamma m$.
