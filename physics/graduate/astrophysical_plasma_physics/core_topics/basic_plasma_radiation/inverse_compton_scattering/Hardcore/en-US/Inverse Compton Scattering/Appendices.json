            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard scenario in high-energy astrophysics—inverse Compton scattering (ICS) by a power-law distribution of relativistic electrons off a blackbody photon field. All provided information is physically and mathematically consistent, and the goals are clear and formalizable. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe aim to derive the asymptotic frequency dependence of the specific emissivity $j_{\\nu}$ for the inverse Compton scattering process. The specific emissivity is the power emitted per unit volume, per unit frequency, and per unit solid angle. For an isotropic system, this is given by\n$$\nj_{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_{\\gamma_{\\min}}^{\\gamma_{\\max}} N_{e}(\\gamma) P_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\nu, \\gamma) \\, d\\gamma\n$$\nwhere $N_{e}(\\gamma) = K \\gamma^{-p}$ is the differential number density of electrons per Lorentz factor $\\gamma$, and $P_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\nu, \\gamma)$ is the power spectrum of radiation scattered by a single electron with Lorentz factor $\\gamma$.\n\nThe problem states we should use an appropriate kernel approximation. In the Thomson limit ($\\gamma \\epsilon \\ll m_{e}c^{2}$), an incident photon of energy $\\epsilon$ scattered by an electron of Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is boosted to an average energy of $\\langle\\epsilon_{s}\\rangle \\approx \\frac{4}{3}\\gamma^{2}\\epsilon$. We adopt this relation as a delta-function approximation for the scattering kernel. That is, a seed photon of energy $\\epsilon$ is scattered to a single energy $\\epsilon_{s} = \\frac{4}{3}\\gamma^{2}\\epsilon$.\n\nThe power spectrum from a single electron is found by considering the rate at which photons from the seed field are scattered. The rate at which an electron scatters photons of energy $\\epsilon$ from the blackbody field with number density $n_{\\mathrm{bb}}(\\epsilon)$ is $c \\sigma_{T} n_{\\mathrm{bb}}(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon$, where $\\sigma_{T}$ is the Thomson cross-section. Each scattering boosts the photon energy to $\\epsilon_{s} = h\\nu$. The power radiated per unit scattered energy $\\epsilon_{s}$ is then\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\epsilon_{s}, \\gamma) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} c \\sigma_{T} n_{\\mathrm{bb}}(\\epsilon) \\epsilon_{s} \\delta\\left(\\epsilon_{s} - \\frac{4}{3}\\gamma^{2}\\epsilon\\right) d\\epsilon\n$$\nEvaluating the integral using the property of the delta function, we find the photon energy that contributes is $\\epsilon = \\frac{3\\epsilon_{s}}{4\\gamma^{2}}$.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\epsilon_{s}, \\gamma) = c \\sigma_{T} n_{\\mathrm{bb}}\\left(\\frac{3\\epsilon_{s}}{4\\gamma^{2}}\\right) \\epsilon_{s} \\left|\\frac{d\\epsilon}{d\\epsilon_s}\\right| = c \\sigma_{T} n_{\\mathrm{bb}}\\left(\\frac{3\\epsilon_{s}}{4\\gamma^{2}}\\right) \\epsilon_{s} \\left(\\frac{3}{4\\gamma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nTo obtain the power spectrum per unit frequency, $P_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\nu, \\gamma)$, we use the relation $P_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\nu, \\gamma) = h P_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\epsilon_{s}, \\gamma)$ with $\\epsilon_{s} = h\\nu$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\nu, \\gamma) = \\frac{3c\\sigma_{T}h^{2}\\nu}{4\\gamma^{2}} n_{\\mathrm{bb}}\\left(\\frac{3h\\nu}{4\\gamma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we can write the specific emissivity $j_{\\nu}$. We are interested in the functional dependence, so we treat constants of proportionality as irrelevant.\n$$\nj_{\\nu} \\propto \\int_{\\gamma_{\\min}}^{\\gamma_{\\max}} \\gamma^{-p} \\frac{\\nu}{\\gamma^{2}} n_{\\mathrm{bb}}\\left(\\frac{3h\\nu}{4\\gamma^{2}}\\right) d\\gamma\n$$\nSubstituting the form of the blackbody spectrum, $n_{\\mathrm{bb}}(\\epsilon) \\propto \\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{\\exp(\\epsilon/k_{B}T) - 1}$:\n$$\nj_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu \\int_{\\gamma_{\\min}}^{\\gamma_{\\max}} \\gamma^{-(p+2)} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{h\\nu}{\\gamma^{2}}\\right)^{2}}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{3h\\nu}{4\\gamma^{2} k_{B}T}\\right) - 1} d\\gamma \\propto \\nu^{3} \\int_{\\gamma_{\\min}}^{\\gamma_{\\max}} \\frac{\\gamma^{-(p+6)}}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{3h\\nu}{4\\gamma^{2} k_{B}T}\\right) - 1} d\\gamma\n$$\nTo analyze this integral, we perform a change of variables to $x = \\frac{3h\\nu}{4\\gamma^{2}k_{B}T}$. This implies $\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\frac{3h\\nu}{4k_{B}T}} x^{-1/2}$, and $d\\gamma \\propto \\nu^{1/2} x^{-3/2} dx$. The integration limits become $x_{\\min} = \\frac{3h\\nu}{4\\gamma_{\\max}^{2}k_{B}T}$ and $x_{\\max} = \\frac{3h\\nu}{4\\gamma_{\\min}^{2}k_{B}T}$.\n$$\nj_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{3} \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{x_{\\max}} \\left(\\nu^{1/2} x^{-1/2}\\right)^{-(p+6)} \\frac{1}{\\exp(x)-1} (\\nu^{1/2} x^{-3/2}) dx\n$$\n$$\nj_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{3} \\nu^{-(p+6)/2} \\nu^{1/2} \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{x_{\\max}} \\frac{x^{(p+6)/2} x^{-3/2}}{\\exp(x)-1} dx\n$$\n$$\nj_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{3 - (p/2) - 3 + 1/2} \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{x_{\\max}} \\frac{x^{(p+3)/2}}{\\exp(x)-1} dx = \\nu^{(1-p)/2} \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{x_{\\max}} \\frac{x^{(p+3)/2}}{\\exp(x)-1} dx\n$$\nThe frequency dependence of $j_{\\nu}$ is determined by the pre-factor $\\nu^{(1-p)/2}$ and the behavior of the integral, which depends on $\\nu$ through its limits $x_{\\min}$ and $x_{\\max}$.\n\n**Low-Frequency Regime**\nThis regime corresponds to low observed frequencies $\\nu$, where the dominant seed photons are from the Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) tail of the blackbody spectrum. This means their energy $\\epsilon = \\frac{3h\\nu}{4\\gamma^2}$ is much less than $k_{B}T$, which implies $x \\ll 1$ over the relevant range of $\\gamma$. For sufficiently low $\\nu$, we have $x_{\\max} = \\frac{3h\\nu}{4\\gamma_{\\min}^{2}k_{B}T} \\ll 1$. In the limit $x \\ll 1$, $\\exp(x)-1 \\approx x$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{x_{\\min}}^{x_{\\max}} \\frac{x^{(p+3)/2}}{x} dx = \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{x_{\\max}} x^{(p+1)/2} dx = \\frac{2}{p+3} \\left[x_{\\max}^{(p+3)/2} - x_{\\min}^{(p+3)/2}\\right]\n$$\nSince $x \\propto \\nu$, the integral is proportional to $\\nu^{(p+3)/2}$. Specifically, since $\\gamma_{\\min} \\ll \\gamma_{\\max}$ and $p>2$, the $x_{\\max}$ term dominates. The integral scales as $\\nu^{(p+3)/2}$.\nThe specific emissivity is then:\n$$\nj_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{(1-p)/2} \\cdot \\nu^{(p+3)/2} = \\nu^{(1-p+p+3)/2} = \\nu^{2}\n$$\nThe low-frequency spectral index is $\\alpha_1 = 2$.\n\n**Intermediate-Frequency Regime**\nThis regime corresponds to observed frequencies $\\nu$ for which the scattering is dominated by seed photons near the blackbody peak, i.e., $\\epsilon \\sim k_{B}T$. This occurs for frequencies $\\nu$ such that the integration range $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$ is wide and contains $x \\sim 1$. This typically means $x_{\\min} \\ll 1 \\ll x_{\\max}$. This occurs for $\\frac{4\\gamma_{\\min}^2 k_B T}{3h} \\ll \\nu \\ll \\frac{4\\gamma_{\\max}^2 k_B T}{3h}$.\nIn this case, the integral can be approximated by extending the limits to $[0, \\infty)$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{(p+3)/2}}{\\exp(x)-1} dx\n$$\nThis is a definite integral whose value depends on $p$ but is constant with respect to $\\nu$. It is equal to $\\Gamma(\\frac{p+5}{2})\\zeta(\\frac{p+5}{2})$. Since the integral is a constant, the frequency dependence of $j_{\\nu}$ is given solely by the pre-factor:\n$$\nj_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{(1-p)/2}\n$$\nThe intermediate-frequency spectral index is $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{1-p}{2}$.\n\n**Characteristic Peak Frequency of $\\nu j_{\\nu}$**\nThe spectral energy distribution (SED) is $\\nu j_{\\nu}$. Based on our derived indices, its shape is a broken power-law:\n$$\n\\nu j_{\\nu} \\propto\n\\begin{cases}\n\\nu^{3}, & \\nu \\ll \\nu_{\\mathrm{break}} \\\\\n\\nu^{(3-p)/2}, & \\nu \\gg \\nu_{\\mathrm{break}}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere the break frequency $\\nu_{\\mathrm{break}}$ marks the transition from the RJ-seed regime to the thermal-peak-seed regime. This transition occurs when the lowest-energy electrons ($\\gamma_{\\min}$) start scattering photons from the thermal peak ($k_{B} T$). This gives a characteristic frequency $\\nu_{\\mathrm{break}} \\approx \\frac{4}{3}\\gamma_{\\min}^2\\frac{k_{B}T}{h}$.\n\nThe location of the peak of the SED $\\nu j_{\\nu}$ depends on the sign of the second power-law index, $(3-p)/2$.\n- If $2 < p < 3$, $(3-p)/2 > 0$. The SED continues to rise after the break, and the peak will be determined by the high-energy cutoff, related to $\\gamma_{\\max}$.\n- If $p > 3$, $(3-p)/2 < 0$. The SED rises as $\\nu^3$ and then falls. The peak of the SED occurs at the break frequency $\\nu_{\\mathrm{break}}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the peak frequency in terms of $\\gamma_{\\min}$, which implies that we are in the case where the peak is determined by the lowest-energy electrons. This is the case for $p > 3$, a physically reasonable assumption for an aged electron population. Under this assumption, the characteristic peak frequency of the SED is:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{4\\gamma_{\\min}^{2}k_{B}T}{3h}\n$$\n\nThe final answer requires the peak frequency, the low-frequency index, and the intermediate-frequency index, in that order.\n\n1.  Peak frequency of $\\nu j_{\\nu}$: $\\nu_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{4\\gamma_{\\min}^{2}k_{B}T}{3h}$\n2.  Low-frequency spectral index for $j_{\\nu}$: $\\alpha_1 = 2$\n3.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the fractional full width at half maximum (FWHM) of an inverse Compton scattering (ICS) spectral feature produced by a relativistic electron population with a narrow energy distribution scattering a monochromatic seed photon field. The derivation must be based on first principles of scattering kinematics and Lorentz transformations.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the energy of a scattered photon, $E$, and the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, of the electron that scattered it. The problem is set in the plasma rest frame. An electron with energy $\\gamma m_e c^2$ and Lorentz factor $\\gamma \\gg 1$ collides with a seed photon of energy $\\epsilon_L$. We are in the Thomson regime, $\\gamma \\epsilon_L \\ll m_e c^2$.\n\nThe kinematic analysis involves two Lorentz transformations and the scattering process in the electron's rest frame ($S'$).\n1.  In $S'$, the electron is at rest. The incident photon's energy $\\epsilon'$ is obtained by a Lorentz transformation from the plasma frame ($S$). For an isotropic photon field, the energy $\\epsilon'$ can range up to approximately $2\\gamma\\epsilon_L$. The condition $\\gamma \\epsilon_L \\ll m_e c^2$ ensures that $\\epsilon' \\ll m_e c^2$, so the scattering in $S'$ is Thomson scattering, which is elastic. Therefore, the scattered photon energy in this frame, $\\epsilon'_1$, is approximately equal to the incident energy, $\\epsilon'_1 \\approx \\epsilon'$.\n2.  Transforming the scattered photon's energy back to the plasma frame $S$ gives its final energy $E$.\n\nThe energy $E$ depends on the initial collision angle and the final scattering angle. For an isotropic distribution of electrons and photons, the spectrum of photons scattered by an electron of a single Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ has a characteristic shape with a finite width (this is the \"angular kernel broadening\"). However, the problem explicitly instructs us to neglect this broadening mechanism and consider only the broadening due to the dispersion in electron energies. This instruction implies we should use a single characteristic energy $E$ for all photons scattered by an electron of a given $\\gamma$. The most physically relevant choice for this characteristic energy, given the isotropic setup, is the angle-averaged energy of the upscattered photon. This average energy is a well-known result of ICS theory:\n$$\n\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{4}{3} \\gamma^2 \\epsilon_L\n$$\nMore generally, the simplification directs us to assume a deterministic mapping $E(\\gamma) = K \\gamma^2$, where $K$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on $\\epsilon_L$ but not on $\\gamma$. For our purposes, the exact value of $K$ is not necessary, as it will cancel out in the final expression for the fractional width.\n\nThe electron population is described by a probability density function for the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ that is a Gaussian:\n$$\nf_e(\\gamma) \\propto \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(\\gamma-\\gamma_0)^2}{2\\sigma_{\\gamma}^{2}}\\right]\n$$\nThis distribution is centered at $\\gamma_0$ with a standard deviation of $\\sigma_\\gamma$.\n\nThe spectral feature in the ICS spectrum arises from this distribution of electron energies. The energy distribution of the scattered photons, which we denote as $g(E)$, is related to the electron distribution $f_e(\\gamma)$ by the conservation of particle number. The number of electrons in an infinitesimal interval $d\\gamma$ must map to the number of scattered photons in the corresponding energy interval $dE$.\n$$\ng(E) dE = f_e(\\gamma) d\\gamma\n$$\nThis allows us to write the shape of the photon energy spectrum as $g(E) \\propto f_e(\\gamma(E)) \\left|\\frac{d\\gamma}{dE}\\right|$. However, to find the FWHM, a simpler approach based on propagation of width is sufficient, especially given the condition $\\sigma_{\\gamma} \\ll \\gamma_{0}$ which implies the distribution is narrow.\n\nThe central energy of the ICS feature, $E_0$, corresponds to the peak of the electron distribution, $\\gamma_0$.

The solution process will now commence.\n\nThe solution requires deriving expressions for the physical parameters of the emitting region ($\\gamma_p$, $B'$, $R'$, $\\delta$) in terms of the observed quantities, and then solving for their numerical values.\n\n**1. Derivation of Parameter Expressions**\n\nFirst, we establish a system of equations based on the provided relationships. All quantities from here on are expressed in CGS units.\n\nThe comoving radius of the source, $R'$, is constrained by the observed variability timescale, $t_{\\mathrm{var}}$, via the light-travel time argument, accounting for relativistic effects:\n$$R' \\leq c \\frac{\\delta t_{\\mathrm{var}}}{1+z}$$\nWe will proceed using the equality, which corresponds to the most compact source for a given variability timescale.\n$$R' = \\frac{c \\delta t_{\\mathrm{var}}}{1+z}$$\n\nThe observed synchrotron peak frequency, $\\nu_s$, is the Doppler-boosted comoving frequency $\\nu_s'$, which is produced by electrons with the characteristic Lorentz factor $\\gamma_p$:\n$$\\nu_s = \\frac{\\delta}{1+z} \\nu_s' = \\frac{\\delta}{1+z} \\left(\\frac{3 e B' \\gamma_p^2}{4 \\pi m_e c}\\right)$$\n\nThe observed SSC peak frequency, $\\nu_c$, arises from inverse Compton scattering of the synchrotron photons (with characteristic frequency $\\nu_s'$) by the same population of electrons ($\\gamma_p$). The observed frequency $\\nu_c$ is the Doppler-boosted comoving frequency $\\nu_c'$:\n$$\\nu_c = \\frac{\\delta}{1+z} \\nu_c' = \\frac{\\delta}{1+z} \\left(\\frac{4}{3} \\gamma_p^2 \\nu_s'\\right)$$\nWe can express $\\nu_s'$ in terms of the observable $\\nu_s$: $\\nu_s' = \\frac{(1+z)}{\\delta}\\nu_s$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\nu_c$:\n$$\\nu_c = \\frac{\\delta}{1+z} \\left(\\frac{4}{3} \\gamma_p^2 \\frac{(1+z)}{\\delta}\\nu_s\\right) = \\frac{4}{3} \\gamma_p^2 \\nu_s$$\nThis provides a direct expression for the electron Lorentz factor $\\gamma_p$:\n$$\\gamma_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{3 \\nu_c}{4 \\nu_s}}$$\n\nThe ratio of the observed peak luminosities, $q = \\frac{L_c}{L_s}$, is equal to the ratio of the comoving luminosities, $q = \\frac{L_c'}{L_s'}$, because the Doppler factor $\\delta^4$ cancels out. In the SSC model, this ratio is well-approximated by the ratio of the energy density of the synchrotron photons, $U_{\\mathrm{syn}}'$, to that of the magnetic field, $U_B'$.\n$$q = \\frac{L_c}{L_s} \\approx \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{syn}}'}{U_B'}$$\nUsing the provided definitions:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{syn}}' = \\frac{L_s'}{4 \\pi R'^2 c} = \\frac{L_s/\\delta^4}{4 \\pi R'^2 c} = \\frac{L_s}{4 \\pi \\delta^4 R'^2 c}$$\n$$U_B' = \\frac{B'^2}{8 \\pi}$$\nThe ratio becomes:\n$$q = \\frac{L_s / (4 \\pi \\delta^4 R'^2 c)}{B'^2 / (8 \\pi)} = \\frac{2 L_s}{\\delta^4 R'^2 B'^2 c}$$\n\nWe now have a system of equations. We can solve for the Doppler factor, $\\delta$. First, we rearrange the equation for $q$ to isolate the unknown parameters:\n$$\\delta^4 R'^2 B'^2 = \\frac{2 L_s}{q c}$$\nNow substitute the expressions for $R'$ and $B'$. From the synchrotron frequency equation, we solve for $B'$:\n$$B' = \\nu_s \\frac{1+z}{\\delta} \\frac{4 \\pi m_e c}{3 e \\gamma_p^2}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $R'$ and $B'$ into the rearranged $q$ equation:\n$$\\delta^4 \\left(\\frac{c \\delta t_{\\mathrm{var}}}{1+z}\\right)^2 \\left(\\nu_s \\frac{1+z}{\\delta} \\frac{4 \\pi m_e c}{3 e \\gamma_p^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2 L_s}{q c}$$\n$$\\delta^4 \\frac{c^2 \\delta^2 t_{\\mathrm{var}}^2}{(1+z)^2} \\frac{\\nu_s^2 (1+z)^2}{\\delta^2} \\left(\\frac{4 \\pi m_e c}{3 e \\gamma_p^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2 L_s}{q c}$$\nThe terms $\\delta^2$ and $(1+z)^2$ cancel, simplifying the expression significantly:\n$$\\delta^4 c^2 t_{\\mathrm{var}}^2 \\nu_s^2 \\left(\\frac{16 \\pi^2 m_e^2 c^2}{9 e^2 \\gamma_p^4}\\right) = \\frac{2 L_s}{q c}$$\nSolving for $\\delta^4$:\n$$\\delta^4 = \\frac{2 L_s}{q c} \\frac{1}{c^2 t_{\\mathrm{var}}^2 \\nu_s^2} \\frac{9 e^2 \\gamma_p^4}{16 \\pi^2 m_e^2 c^2} = \\frac{18 e^2 L_s \\gamma_p^4}{16 \\pi^2 q c^5 m_e^2 t_{\\mathrm{var}}^2 \\nu_s^2} = \\frac{9 e^2 L_s \\gamma_p^4}{8 \\pi^2 q c^5 m_e^2 t_{\\mathrm{var}}^2 \\nu_s^2}$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_p^4 = (\\frac{3\\nu_c}{4\\nu_s})^2 = \\frac{9 \\nu_c^2}{16 \\nu_s^2}$:\n$$\\delta^4 = \\frac{9 e^2 L_s}{8 \\pi^2 q c^5 m_e^2 t_{\\mathrm{var}}^2 \\nu_s^2} \\left(\\frac{9 \\nu_c^2}{16 \\nu_s^2}\\right) = \\frac{81 e^2 L_s \\nu_c^2}{128 \\pi^2 q c^5 m_e^2 t_{\\mathrm{var}}^2 \\nu_s^4}$$\nFinally, we have the expression for $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\left(\\frac{81 e^2 L_s \\nu_c^2}{128 \\pi^2 q c^5 m_e^2 t_{\\mathrm{var}}^2 \\nu_s^4}\\right)^{1/4}$$\n\n**2.

Computation of $B'$ and $n_e'$**\n\nUsing $\\delta = 19.023$, we can find the other parameters.\nFirst, $\\gamma_p$:\n$$\\gamma_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{3 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{23}}{4 \\times 5.0 \\times 10^{14}}} = \\sqrt{1.5 \\times 10^8} \\approx 1.225 \\times 10^4$$\nNext, the magnetic field $B'$:\n$$B' = \\nu_s \\frac{1+z}{\\delta} \\frac{4 \\pi m_e c}{3 e \\gamma_p^2} = (5.0 \\times 10^{14}) \\frac{1.10}{19.023} \\frac{4 \\pi (9.109 \\times 10^{-28})(2.998 \\times 10^{10})}{3(4.803 \\times 10^{-10})(1.5 \\times 10^8)} \\approx 0.0459 \\, \\mathrm{G}$$\nFinally, using the equipartition condition $U_e' = n_e' \\gamma_p m_e c^2 \\approx U_B' = B'^2/(8\\pi)$, we find $n_e'$:\n$$n_e' = \\frac{B'^2}{8 \\pi \\gamma_p m_e c^2} = \\frac{(0.0459)^2}{8 \\pi (1.225 \\times 10^4) (9.109 \\times 10^{-28}) (2.998 \\times 10^{10})^2} \\approx 8.37 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nThe derived values are physically reasonable for a blazar jet environment.
