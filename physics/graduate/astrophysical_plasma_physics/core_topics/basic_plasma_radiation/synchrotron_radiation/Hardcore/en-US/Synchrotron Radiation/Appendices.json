This exercise  bridges the gap between the instantaneous power emitted, as described by the Liénard formula, and the total energy radiated over a complete orbit. Mastering this calculation is essential for understanding energy budget constraints in circular accelerators and for estimating the radiative cooling timescales of electrons in astrophysical plasmas.",

            "problem": "A particle of charge $q$ and rest mass $m_0$ moves in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$. The particle's velocity is at all times perpendicular to the magnetic field, causing its trajectory to be a perfect circle. Due to its centripetal acceleration, the particle emits synchrotron radiation. The total instantaneous power radiated by a relativistic point charge is given by the Liénard formula:\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{q^2 \\gamma^6}{6\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^3} \\left[ (\\dot{\\vec{\\beta}})^2 - (\\vec{\\beta} \\times \\dot{\\vec{\\beta}})^2 \\right]\n$$\n\nHere, $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$ is the particle's velocity normalized to the speed of light $c$, $\\dot{\\vec{\\beta}}$ is its time derivative, $\\gamma = (1-\\beta^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor, and $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.\n\nThe particle has a constant total energy $E$.

            "solution": "The instantaneous power is given by the Liénard formula. For circular motion, the acceleration vector $\\dot{\\vec{\\beta}}$ is always perpendicular to the velocity vector $\\vec{\\beta}$. The general formula simplifies significantly:\n$$\nP = \\frac{q^2 \\gamma^6}{6\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^3} \\left[ |\\dot{\\vec{\\beta}}|^2 - |\\vec{\\beta} \\times \\dot{\\vec{\\beta}}|^2 \\right] = \\frac{q^2 \\gamma^6}{6\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^3} \\left[ |\\dot{\\vec{\\beta}}|^2 - \\beta^2 |\\dot{\\vec{\\beta}}|^2 \\right] = \\frac{q^2 \\gamma^6}{6\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^3} |\\dot{\\vec{\\beta}}|^2(1-\\beta^2) = \\frac{q^2 \\gamma^4}{6\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^3} |\\dot{\\vec{\\beta}}|^2\n$$\nSince $\\vec{a} = c \\dot{\\vec{\\beta}}$, we have $P = \\frac{q^2 \\gamma^4}{6\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^3} a^2$.\n\nThe centripetal acceleration is caused by the magnetic Lorentz force: $\\gamma m_0 a = qvB$. So, the acceleration magnitude is $a = \\frac{qvB}{\\gamma m_0}$.

This practice  explores the fundamental difference between incoherent and coherent radiation, which depends on the spatial distribution of the charges relative to the wavelength of the emitted light. Understanding this distinction is crucial, as it explains the immense power of coherent sources and why the total power can scale with the number of particles as $N^2$ rather than simply $N$.",

Let $P_{1}$ denote the total synchrotron power radiated by a single electron on this trajectory.
