It is a standard, formalizable problem in theoretical astrophysics.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe starting point is the momentum equation for a static ($\\boldsymbol{v} = \\boldsymbol{0}$) fluid in ideal MHD, which describes magnetostatic equilibrium. As given in the main text in Gaussian units, this is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{0} = -\\nabla p + \\frac{1}{4\\pi}(\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B}) \\times \\boldsymbol{B} + \\rho \\boldsymbol{g} $$\nThe term $\\frac{1}{4\\pi}(\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B}) \\times \\boldsymbol{B}$ represents the magnetic force density. We must evaluate this term for the given magnetic field configuration, $\\boldsymbol{B} = B_0\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$, where $B_0$ is a constant.\n\nThe curl of the magnetic field is:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B} = \\nabla \\times (B_0\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}) $$\nIn Cartesian coordinates, the curl operator is given by:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial z}\\right)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial x}\\right)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial y}\\right)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} $$\nFor our field $\\boldsymbol{B} = B_0\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$, the components are $B_x = B_0$, $B_y = 0$, and $B_z = 0$. Since $B_0$ is a constant, all its partial derivatives are zero. Therefore:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B} = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\nThis implies that the magnetic force term $(\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B}) \\times \\boldsymbol{B}$ is also zero. This specific magnetic field configuration exerts no force on the plasma.\n\nThe magnetostatic equilibrium equation simplifies to the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{0} = -\\nabla p + \\rho \\boldsymbol{g} $$\nGiven that the system is plane-parallel, we assume that all scalar quantities depend only on the vertical coordinate $z$. The pressure gradient is $\\nabla p = \\frac{dp}{dz}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$. The gravitational force is $\\rho \\boldsymbol{g} = -\\rho g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$. The vector equation thus reduces to a scalar equation for the vertical ($\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$) component:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{dp}{dz} - \\rho g $$\nThis is the required ordinary differential equation for vertical force balance.\n\nThe next step is to use the isothermal equation of state, $p = c_s^2\\,\\rho$, where $c_s$ is a constant. Differentiating this with respect to $z$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dz} = c_s^2 \\frac{d\\rho}{dz} $$\nSubstituting this derivative into the force balance equation, we get:\n$$ -c_s^2 \\frac{d\\rho}{dz} = \\rho g $$\nThis is a first-order separable ordinary differential equation for $\\rho(z)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\rho} d\\rho = -\\frac{g}{c_s^2} dz $$\nWe integrate this equation from the reference level $z=0$ to an arbitrary height $z$. The density at $z=0$ is given as $\\rho_0$.\n$$ \\int_{\\rho_0}^{\\rho(z)} \\frac{d\\rho'}{\\rho'} = \\int_0^z -\\frac{g}{c_s^2} dz' $$\nThe integration yields:\n$$ [\\ln(\\rho')]_{\\rho_0}^{\\rho(z)} = -\\frac{g}{c_s^2}[z']_0^z $$\n$$ \\ln(\\rho(z)) - \\ln(\\rho_0) = -\\frac{g z}{c_s^2} $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\rho(z)}{\\rho_0}\\right) = -\\frac{g z}{c_s^2} $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the density profile:\n$$ \\rho(z) = \\rho_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g z}{c_s^2}\\right) $$\nThis is the characteristic exponential density stratification of an isothermal atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium.\n\nThe problem asks to define the gas pressure scale height, $H$. The scale height is the characteristic vertical distance over which the pressure (and in an isothermal atmosphere, the density) decreases by a factor of $e$. In our derived expression for $\\rho(z)$, the argument of the exponential is $-z/H$. By comparing this form with our result, we can identify $H$.\n$$ \\rho(z) = \\rho_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{H}\\right) $$\nFrom our derivation, we have $\\rho(z) = \\rho_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g z}{c_s^2}\\right)$. Comparing the two forms, we identify the scale height $H$ as:\n$$ H = \\frac{c_s^2}{g} $$\nUsing this definition, the density profile can be written compactly as:\n$$ \\rho(z) = \\rho_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{H}\\right) $$\nThe final answer consists of this expression for the density profile and the definition of the scale height $H$.",

It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem in theoretical astrophysics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the fastest linear growth rate, $\\gamma_{\\max}$, for the undular Parker instability based on a set of physical heuristics. The Parker instability is driven by magnetic buoyancy. A vertically perturbed magnetic flux tube in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere becomes buoyant relative to its surroundings if gas can drain from its crests. This buoyancy drives the perturbation, leading to exponential growth. The growth rate is determined by the interplay of the driving buoyancy force and the processes that mediate the instability.\n\nThe problem provides two key assumptions to construct the expression for $\\gamma_{\\max}$:\n1.  The characteristic length scale of the fastest growing mode is the gravitational scale height, $H$. This applies to both the vertical extent of the mode and its parallel wavelength, $\\lambda_x \\sim H$.\n2.  The growth of the instability is limited by two concurrent physical processes: acoustic readjustment and Alfvénic mass drainage.\n\nWe can translate these physical limitations into characteristic timescales. The overall growth rate, $\\gamma_{\\max}$, will be the inverse of the total timescale, $\\tau_{\\text{growth}}$, which is determined by the combination of the timescales of the limiting processes.\n\n1.  **Acoustic Readjustment Timescale ($\\tau_s$)**: The instability involves vertical motion of gas, which perturbs the background hydrostatic pressure balance. The atmosphere can respond to these perturbations and attempt to re-establish equilibrium via pressure (sound) waves. The characteristic time for this readjustment to occur over the vertical scale $H$ is the sound-crossing time.\n    $$ \\tau_s = \\frac{H}{c_s} $$\n    Here, $c_s$ is the isothermal sound speed, which is constant in this atmosphere.\n\n2.  **Alfvénic Mass Drainage Timescale ($\\tau_A$)**: A crucial element of the undular Parker instability is the drainage of gas along the perturbed magnetic field lines from the crests to the troughs, which enhances the buoyancy of the crests. The information and mass transport for this drainage process are mediated by MHD waves. The characteristic speed for processes involving the magnetic field tension and inertia of the plasma is the Alfvén speed, $v_A$. Based on the assumption that the parallel wavelength of the fastest growing mode is $\\lambda_x \\sim H$, the timescale for mass to drain over this distance is the Alfvén-crossing time.\n    $$ \\tau_A = \\frac{H}{v_A} $$\n    Here, $v_A$ is the Alfvén speed, defined at the midplane.\n\nThe growth of the instability requires both the vertical atmospheric structure to respond and the parallel mass drainage to occur. These are coupled processes that must happen for the instability to develop. A physically motivated heuristic for the total timescale of such a coupled, multi-step process is the sum of the individual timescales. This represents the idea that the full cycle of the feedback loop cannot complete faster than the sum of the durations of its necessary steps.\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{growth}} = \\tau_s + \\tau_A $$\n\nThe maximum growth rate, $\\gamma_{\\max}$, is the reciprocal of this total growth timescale.\n$$ \\gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{growth}}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_s + \\tau_A} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{H}{c_s} + \\frac{H}{v_A}} $$\nWe can simplify this expression to obtain a closed-form result:\n$$ \\gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{H \\left(\\frac{1}{c_s} + \\frac{1}{v_A}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{H} \\frac{c_s v_A}{c_s + v_A} $$\nThis expression gives the fastest growth rate as a function of the scale height $H$, the sound speed $c_s$, and the Alfvén speed $v_A$. This is the desired analytic expression. To explicitly write it as a function of the ratio $v_A/c_s$ and $H$, we can factor out $c_s$ from the denominator:\n$$ \\gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{c_s v_A}{H c_s (1 + v_A/c_s)} = \\frac{v_A}{H(1 + v_A/c_s)} $$\nOr, alternatively, by factoring out $c_s/H$:\n$$ \\gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{c_s}{H} \\frac{v_A/c_s}{1 + v_A/c_s} $$\nAll these forms are equivalent. The first, most symmetric form is clear and sufficient.\n\nNext, we must analyze the asymptotic behavior of $\\gamma_{\\max}$ in the limits of high and low plasma beta, $\\beta$. The plasma beta is defined as $\\beta \\equiv 8\\pi p_{0}/B_{0}^{2}$. For an isothermal gas, $p_0 = \\rho_0 c_s^2$. Using the definition of the Alfvén speed, $v_A^2 = B_0^2/(4\\pi\\rho_0)$, we can relate $\\beta$ to $c_s$ and $v_A$:\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{8\\pi (\\rho_0 c_s^2)}{B_0^2} = \\frac{2 \\rho_0 c_s^2}{B_0^2/(4\\pi)} = 2 \\frac{c_s^2}{B_0^2/(4\\pi \\rho_0)} = 2 \\frac{c_s^2}{v_A^2} $$\nThis relation, $\\beta = 2(c_s/v_A)^2$, allows us to explore the required limits.\n\n**Asymptotic Scaling Behaviors:**\n\n1.  **Low-Beta Regime ($\\beta \\ll 1$): Magnetically Dominated Plasma.**\n    The condition $\\beta \\ll 1$ implies $2(c_s/v_A)^2 \\ll 1$, which means $v_A \\gg c_s$, or equivalently, the ratio $v_A/c_s \\gg 1$.\n    In this limit, in the denominator of our expression for $\\gamma_{\\max}$, $c_s + v_A \\approx v_A$.\n    $$ \\gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{c_s v_A}{H(c_s + v_A)} \\approx \\frac{c_s v_A}{H v_A} = \\frac{c_s}{H} $$\n    In the magnetically dominated regime, the growth rate approaches a constant value, $c_s/H$. Using $H = c_s^2/g$, this can also be written as $g/c_s$.\n    Physically, the Alfvén speed is very high, so mass drainage along the stiff magnetic field lines is very efficient and not the limiting factor. The growth is limited by the timescale of buoyant response of the gas, which is the sound-crossing time over a scale height, $\\tau_s$.\n    The scaling with the ratio $v_A/c_s$ is:\n    $$ \\gamma_{\\max} \\propto \\left(\\frac{v_A}{c_s}\\right)^0 $$\n\n2.  **High-Beta Regime ($\\beta \\gg 1$): Gas Pressure Dominated Plasma.**\n    The condition $\\beta \\gg 1$ implies $2(c_s/v_A)^2 \\gg 1$, which means $c_s \\gg v_A$, or equivalently, the ratio $v_A/c_s \\ll 1$.\n    In this limit, in the denominator of our expression for $\\gamma_{\\max}$, $c_s + v_A \\approx c_s$.\n    $$ \\gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{c_s v_A}{H(c_s + v_A)} \\approx \\frac{c_s v_A}{H c_s} = \\frac{v_A}{H} $$\n    In the gas pressure dominated regime, the growth rate is proportional to the Alfvén speed.\n    Physically, the sound speed is very high, so the atmosphere can readjust its pressure balance almost instantaneously. The growth is limited by the rate at which mass can drain along the weak, floppy magnetic field lines. This drainage is an Alfvénic process, so its timescale is $\\tau_A$, making it the bottleneck.\n    The scaling with the ratio $v_A/c_s$ is:\n    $$ \\gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{v_A}{H} = \\frac{c_s}{H} \\left(\\frac{v_A}{c_s}\\right) \\propto \\left(\\frac{v_A}{c_s}\\right)^1 $$\n\nThese asymptotic scalings are consistent with detailed linear stability analyses and physical intuition, which supports the validity of the heuristic approach requested in the problem.\nThe final answer is the derived closed-form expression for $\\gamma_{\\max}$.",

Line-tying means the field-line footpoints are rigidly anchored at the boundaries, enforcing $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(z=0) = \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(z=H) = \\mathbf{0}$; free-slip means the boundaries are impenetrable but stress-free, enforcing $\\xi_z(z=0,H) = 0$ and $\\partial \\xi_{x,y}/\\partial z \\,(z=0,H) = 0$. Line-tying increases the magnetic tension penalty through enhanced vertical curvature of eigenfunctions, raises the critical along-field wavelength for the undular Parker mode, reduces growth rates, and strongly suppresses interchange ($k_x=0$) modes; free-slip reduces the boundary-induced tension penalty, lowers the critical wavelength for instability, permits larger growth rates, and allows interchange-like motions more readily.\n\nB. Line-tying means field lines can slide tangentially without resistance at the boundaries, enforcing $\\partial \\xi_{x,y}/\\partial z \\,(z=0,H) = 0$, while free-slip fixes the footpoints by requiring $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(z=0) = \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(z=H) = \\mathbf{0}$.

Line-tying constrains only the compressibility via $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\xi} = 0$ at the boundaries without affecting field-line motion; free-slip allows both normal and tangential motion at the boundary. Because the Parker instability is driven by buoyancy alone, the choice of boundary condition does not alter the qualitative growth or thresholds.\n\nD. Line-tying suppresses interchange ($k_x=0$) motions but, by enforcing fixed endpoints, increases the arching of field lines for undular ($k_x \\neq 0$) modes and thus reduces the magnetic tension penalty relative to free-slip; consequently line-tying lowers the critical wavelength and enhances growth of undular Parker modes compared to free-slip.\n\nYour answer should be based on first principles starting from the ideal MHD equations, the induction relation for $\\delta \\mathbf{B}$, and the qualitative structure of vertical eigenfunctions imposed by the respective boundary conditions, rather than any memorized formula or specific dispersion relation.",

A unique qualitative answer based on physical reasoning is expected.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is phrased in precise, objective, scientific language. It is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or non-scientific claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It presents a valid, classic problem in MHD stability theory. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\n---\n\n## DERIVATION AND OPTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe Parker instability arises from the competition between a destabilizing force (magnetic buoyancy) and stabilizing forces (gas pressure gradients and magnetic tension). We will analyze this competition qualitatively.\n\n### First Principles\n\n1.  **Driving Force: Magnetic Buoyancy**\n    In a gravitationally stratified atmosphere where density $\\rho_0(z)$ decreases with height $z$, a magnetic flux tube is in equilibrium. If a segment of a horizontal flux tube is perturbed vertically upwards by a displacement $\\xi_z$, the plasma within it expands. To maintain pressure balance with the surroundings, plasma slides down the newly arched field lines, emptying the crests. This makes the plasma at the perturbed crests less dense than the surrounding ambient plasma at the same height. The result is a net upward buoyancy force, $\\mathbf{F}_{buoy} \\propto -\\delta \\rho \\, \\mathbf{g}$, which can drive the perturbation to grow, leading to instability.\n\n2.  **Restoring Force: Magnetic Tension**\n    Magnetic field lines behave like elastic strings; they possess tension and resist being bent. The magnetic tension force acts to straighten bent field lines. This force is a primary stabilizing influence against the Parker instability. The magnitude of the tension force is proportional to the field strength squared and the curvature of the field line, $\\mathbf{F}_{tension} \\propto B^2/\\mathcal{R}$, where $\\mathcal{R}$ is the radius of curvature. For a small perturbation, the energy cost associated with bending is proportional to $\\int |\\delta \\mathbf{B}|^2 dV$.\n\n3.  **Mode Types**\n    -   **Undular modes ($k_x \\neq 0$):** Perturbations vary along the direction of the background magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. This directly bends the field lines in the $x-z$ plane, creating a significant tension force proportional to $k_x^2 B_0^2$. This instability is only possible for sufficiently long wavelengths (small $k_x$) where buoyancy can overcome this tension.\n    -   **Interchange modes ($k_x = 0$):** Perturbations are uniform along $\\mathbf{B}_0$. This corresponds to moving entire flux tubes without bending them along their length. In a simple, unconstrained system, this avoids the primary tension penalty. The instability then involves swapping a more buoyant flux tube with a less buoyant one.\n\n### The Role of Boundary Conditions\n\nBoundary conditions at the top ($z=H$) and bottom ($z=0$) of the layer constrain the vertical structure of the displacement eigenfunction $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(z)$. This directly impacts the amount of vertical bending or shearing of the magnetic field, which contributes to the total magnetic tension penalty. The perturbed magnetic field is $\\delta \\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times (\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\times \\mathbf{B}_0)$. The energy associated with this perturbation, $\\int |\\delta \\mathbf{B}|^2 dV$, includes terms proportional to the vertical derivatives of the displacement, such as $(\\partial_z \\xi_z)^2$ and $(\\partial_z \\xi_y)^2$. These terms represent the energy cost of vertically bending/shearing the field.\n\n#### Analysis of Boundary Conditions\n\n1.  **Line-Tying Boundary Conditions**\n    -   **Physical Meaning:** The field lines are \"frozen\" into perfectly conducting boundaries. This corresponds to the plasma displacement being zero at these boundaries: $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(z=0) = \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(z=H) = \\mathbf{0}$. This means $\\xi_x, \\xi_y, \\xi_z$ must all be zero at $z=0$ and $z=H$.\n    -   **Impact on Stability:**\n        -   Any non-trivial displacement eigenfunction must bow or bend between the boundaries. For example, the lowest-order vertical mode for any component of $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ will be sinusoidal, like $\\sin(\\pi z/H)$. This enforces a significant vertical gradient (curvature) throughout the layer, as $\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\xi}/\\partial z$ cannot be zero everywhere.\n        -   This forced vertical curvature leads to a large magnetic tension penalty, adding to the stability of the layer. The system must do more work against magnetic tension to become unstable.\n        -   For **undular modes ($k_x \\neq 0$)**, this boundary-induced tension adds to the tension from along-field bending. To achieve instability, the along-field bending must be reduced, meaning a smaller $k_x$ is required. Thus, line-tying *increases* the critical wavelength for instability and *reduces* the growth rates ($\\sigma$) of unstable modes.\n        -   For **interchange modes ($k_x = 0$)**, the very concept of interchanging flux tubes is thwarted. Since the footpoints are anchored, a flux tube cannot be swapped with its neighbor. Any vertical motion of a flux tube must involve stretching it, which is energetically very costly. Therefore, line-tying *strongly suppresses* or completely stabilizes interchange modes.\n\n2.  **Free-Slip Boundary Conditions**\n    -   **Physical Meaning:** The boundaries are impenetrable but frictionless. \"Impenetrable\" means the normal component of displacement is zero: $\\xi_z(z=0,H) = 0$. \"Stress-free\" or \"frictionless\" for the tangential components is often modeled by requiring the vertical shear of the tangential displacement to be zero: $\\partial \\xi_{x,y}/\\partial z \\,(z=0,H) = 0$. This allows the plasma to slide tangentially along the boundary.\n    -   **Impact on Stability:**\n        -   These conditions are much less restrictive than line-tying. The system can adopt eigenmodes that minimize vertical curvature. For example, a tangential displacement like $\\xi_x(z) \\propto \\cos(\\pi z/H)$ satisfies $\\partial \\xi_x/\\partial z = 0$ at the boundaries. The eigenfunctions can be \"smoother\" in the vertical direction.\n        -   This ability to reduce vertical gradients *reduces* the boundary-induced magnetic tension penalty compared to the line-tied case.\n        -   For **undular modes ($k_x \\neq 0$)**, with a lower overall tension penalty, the instability can occur more easily. A larger along-field curvature (larger $k_x$) can be tolerated. Thus, free-slip conditions *decrease* the critical wavelength for instability and *permit larger* growth rates.\n        -   For **interchange modes ($k_x=0$)**, a collective motion of flux tubes is now much more feasible. Since the field lines are not anchored, they can slide at the boundaries, allowing for flute-like motions where flux tubes are exchanged. Therefore, free-slip conditions *allow interchange-like motions more readily* than line-tying conditions.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n-   **Option A**: This option correctly defines line-tying as $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}=\\mathbf{0}$ and free-slip as $\\xi_z=0, \\partial_z \\xi_{x,y}=0$. It correctly states that line-tying increases the tension penalty via enhanced vertical curvature, which raises the critical wavelength (stabilizes), reduces growth rates, and suppresses interchange modes. It also correctly states that free-slip reduces this penalty, lowering the critical wavelength (destabilizes), permitting larger growth rates, and allowing interchange modes. This aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n-   **Option B**: This option incorrectly swaps the definitions of line-tying and free-slip. Consequently, its conclusions about stability are reversed and incorrect.\n-   **Option C**: This option incorrectly defines line-tying and free-slip. Crucially, it makes the physically false claim that boundary conditions do not alter stability because the instability is \"driven by buoyancy alone.\" This ignores the critical role of the stabilizing tension force, which is directly modified by boundary conditions.\n-   **Option D**: This option correctly states that line-tying suppresses interchange modes. However, it then makes a contradictory argument: it claims that enforcing fixed endpoints (line-tying) \"increases the arching of field lines\" but then incorrectly concludes this *reduces* the tension penalty. Increased arching (curvature) *increases* the tension penalty. The subsequent conclusions that line-tying lowers the critical wavelength and enhances growth are therefore incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A provides a completely accurate description of the physical meaning of the boundary conditions and their qualitative effects on the stability of Parker modes.\n\n---\n**Option-by-Option Analysis Summary:**\n\n-   **A. Line-tying means the field-line footpoints are rigidly anchored at the boundaries, enforcing $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(z=0) = \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(z=H) = \\mathbf{0}$; free-slip means the boundaries are impenetrable but stress-free, enforcing $\\xi_z(z=0,H) = 0$ and $\\partial \\xi_{x,y}/\\partial z \\,(z=0,H) = 0$. Line-tying increases the magnetic tension penalty through enhanced vertical curvature of eigenfunctions, raises the critical along-field wavelength for the undular Parker mode, reduces growth rates, and strongly suppresses interchange ($k_x=0$) modes; free-slip reduces the boundary-induced tension penalty, lowers the critical wavelength for instability, permits larger growth rates, and allows interchange-like motions more readily.**\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.** The definitions and the physical consequences for both mode types are described accurately and consistently with MHD principles.\n\n-   **B. Line-tying means field lines can slide tangentially without resistance at the boundaries, enforcing $\\partial \\xi_{x,y}/\\partial z \\,(z=0,H) = 0$, while free-slip fixes the footpoints by requiring $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(z=0) = \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(z=H) = \\mathbf{0}$. Therefore line-tying destabilizes undular modes by reducing curvature, while free-slip stabilizes by increasing tension.**\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.** The definitions of the boundary conditions are swapped. The physical consequences are therefore reversed.\n\n-   **C. Line-tying constrains only the compressibility via $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\xi} = 0$ at the boundaries without affecting field-line motion; free-slip allows both normal and tangential motion at the boundary. Because the Parker instability is driven by buoyancy alone, the choice of boundary condition does not alter the qualitative growth or thresholds.**\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.** The definitions are wrong, and the central premise that boundary conditions are irrelevant is physically false.\n\n-   **D. Line-tying suppresses interchange ($k_x=0$) motions but, by enforcing fixed endpoints, increases the arching of field lines for undular ($k_x \\neq 0$) modes and thus reduces the magnetic tension penalty relative to free-slip; consequently line-tying lowers the critical wavelength and enhances growth of undular Parker modes compared to free-slip.**\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.** Contains a logical contradiction. Increased arching/bending *increases* the tension penalty, it does not reduce it. The conclusion is a direct opposite of the correct physical effect.",
