The model of a coronal loop as a straight cylinder is a standard and useful approximation (the \"cylindrical pinch\" model). The structure of the magnetic field, the definition of the field line twist, the safety factor, and the Kruskal–Shafranov criterion are all fundamental concepts in plasma physics. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary definitions and data to derive the desired quantities. The givens are consistent, and a unique, meaningful solution exists. The relationship between the twist angle $\\Phi(r)$ and the safety factor $q(r)$ is a direct consequence of their geometric and physical definitions.\n-   **Objective (Critical)**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language.

It is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable. It is a standard, well-formulated physics problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires us to first derive the relationship between the edge safety factor $q(a)$ and the measured edge twist angle $\\Phi(a)$. We begin from the first principle that defines a magnetic field line. A magnetic field line is a curve in space whose tangent vector is everywhere parallel to the magnetic field vector $\\mathbf{B}$.\n\nIn cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$, a differential element of displacement along the curve is $d\\mathbf{l} = dr\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + r\\,d\\theta\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} + dz\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The condition that $d\\mathbf{l}$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{B} = B_r\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + B_\\theta\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} + B_z\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ is expressed by the field line equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{B_r} = \\frac{r\\,d\\theta}{B_\\theta} = \\frac{dz}{B_z}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the magnetic field as $\\mathbf{B}(r) = B_{z}(r)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + B_{\\theta}(r)\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$. This means the radial component of the magnetic field, $B_r$, is zero. The field line equation $\\frac{dr}{B_r} = \\frac{dr}{0}$ implies that $dr=0$. This means that magnetic field lines lie on cylindrical surfaces of constant radius $r$.\n\nThe remaining part of the field line equation gives the relationship between the azimuthal advance $d\\theta$ and the axial displacement $dz$ along a field line at a constant radius $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{r\\,d\\theta}{B_\\theta(r)} = \\frac{dz}{B_z(r)}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this to find the local rate of change of the azimuthal angle with respect to the axial position, which represents the local \"twist\" of the field line:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dz} = \\frac{B_\\theta(r)}{r B_z(r)}\n$$\nThe problem defines the total twist angle $\\Phi(r)$ as the integral of this rate of change over the length $L$ of the plasma column, from $z=0$ to $z=L$. Since $B_\\theta$ and $B_z$ are functions of $r$ only, the integrand is constant with respect to $z$:\n$$\n\\Phi(r) = \\int_0^L \\frac{d\\theta}{dz} dz = \\int_0^L \\frac{B_\\theta(r)}{r B_z(r)} dz = \\frac{B_\\theta(r)}{r B_z(r)} L\n$$\n\nNext, we introduce the safety factor, $q(r)$. The safety factor is a standard parameter in fusion and astrophysical plasmas that measures the pitch of a helical magnetic field line. It is defined as the number of times a field line goes around the long way (axially in this case) for every one time it goes around the short way (azimuthally). In the context of a straight cylinder of length $L$, which can be viewed as the large-aspect-ratio limit of a torus where the major radius $R$ is related to $L$ by $L = 2\\pi R$, the safety factor $q(r)$ is given by:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{r B_z(r)}{R B_\\theta(r)} = \\frac{r B_z(r)}{(L/2\\pi) B_\\theta(r)} = \\frac{2\\pi r B_z(r)}{L B_\\theta(r)}\n$$\nThis can be seen as the ratio of the axial distance needed for one full azimuthal turn ($2\\pi r B_z/B_\\theta$) to the total length of the system ($L$).\n\nWe now have two expressions, one for the total twist $\\Phi(r)$ and one for the safety factor $q(r)$:\n1. $\\Phi(r) = \\frac{L B_\\theta(r)}{r B_z(r)}$\n2. $q(r) = \\frac{2\\pi r B_z(r)}{L B_\\theta(r)}$\n\nWe can see that the expression for $q(r)$ is related to the reciprocal of the expression for $\\Phi(r)$. From expression (1), we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{r B_z(r)}{L B_\\theta(r)} = \\frac{1}{\\Phi(r)}\n$$\nSubstituting this into expression (2) for $q(r)$, we get the desired relationship:\n$$\nq(r) = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{r B_z(r)}{L B_\\theta(r)}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\Phi(r)}\n$$\nThis expression holds for any radius $r$. For the edge of the plasma column at $r=a$, the relationship is:\n$$\nq(a) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\Phi(a)}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the measured edge twist angle $\\Phi(a) = 3\\pi$. We can now compute the numerical value of the edge safety factor $q(a)$:\n$$\nq(a) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3\\pi} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\n\nFinally, we must assess the stability of the configuration with respect to the ideal MHD $m=1$ kink mode using the Kruskal–Shafranov stability criterion. The Kruskal–Shafranov criterion states that for a current-carrying plasma column to be stable against the external $m=1$ kink instability, the safety factor at the plasma edge, $q(a)$, must be greater than $1$.\n$$\nq(a)  1 \\quad (\\text{for stability})\n$$\nIf this condition is not met, a resonant helical perturbation can grow, leading to a macroscopic deformation of the plasma column.\n\nIn our case, we calculated the edge safety factor to be $q(a) = \\frac{2}{3}$. Comparing this value to the stability threshold:\n$$\nq(a) = \\frac{2}{3}  1\n$$\nSince the edge safety factor is less than $1$, the Kruskal–Shafranov criterion is violated. Therefore, based on this criterion, the plasma configuration is predicted to be unstable to the ideal MHD $m=1$ kink mode.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of $q(a)$ as the final answer.",

We choose the Amperian loop $C$ to be a circle of radius $r$ ($0 \\le r \\le a$) centered on the $z$-axis. The differential line element is $d\\mathbf{l} = r \\, d\\theta \\, \\hat{\\theta}$.

With the uniform axial field $B_z = B_{z0}$, this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dz} = \\frac{B_{\\theta}(r)}{r B_{z0}} $$\nThe total angle of twist, $\\Delta\\theta(r)$, for a field line at radius $r$ over one axial period $L$ is obtained by integrating this expression from $z=0$ to $z=L$:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta(r) = \\int_0^L \\frac{B_{\\theta}(r)}{r B_{z0}} \\, dz = \\frac{B_{\\theta}(r)}{r B_{z0}} \\int_0^L dz = \\frac{L B_{\\theta}(r)}{r B_{z0}} $$\nThe problem defines the safety factor $q(r)$ as the number of axial periods required for a field line to complete one full $2\\pi$ turn. This means the total twist over $q(r)$ periods must be $2\\pi$:\n$$ q(r) \\cdot \\Delta\\theta(r) = 2\\pi $$\nTherefore, the safety factor is the inverse of the twist angle in units of $2\\pi$:\n$$ q(r) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\Delta\\theta(r)} = \\frac{2\\pi r B_{z0}}{L B_{\\theta}(r)} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $B_{\\theta}(r)$ derived in Part 1:\n$$ q(r) = \\frac{2\\pi r B_{z0}}{L \\left[ \\frac{\\mu_{0} J_0 r}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right) \\right]} $$\nSimplifying, we obtain the safety factor profile:\n$$ q(r) = \\frac{4\\pi B_{z0}}{\\mu_{0} L J_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right)} $$\n\n### Part 3: Determination of the Critical Current Density $J_{0,\\mathrm{crit}}$\n\nThe Kruskal-Shafranov (KS) marginal kink condition is stated as a total field-line twist of exactly $2\\pi$ at the edge of the plasma column ($r=a$) over one axial period ($L$). Mathematically, this is:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta(r=a) = 2\\pi $$\nUsing our expression for $\\Delta\\theta(r) = \\frac{L B_{\\theta}(r)}{r B_{z0}}$, we first evaluate $B_{\\theta}(r)$ at $r=a$:\n$$ B_{\\theta}(a) = \\frac{\\mu_{0} J_0 a}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{a^2}{2a^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\mu_{0} J_0 a}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\mu_{0} J_0 a}{4} $$\nNow, we compute the twist at the edge, $\\Delta\\theta(a)$:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta(a) = \\frac{L B_{\\theta}(a)}{a B_{z0}} = \\frac{L}{a B_{z0}} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{0} J_0 a}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\mu_{0} L J_0}{4 B_{z0}} $$\nThe KS condition sets this twist to $2\\pi$. The current density $J_0$ at this marginal stability limit is the critical current density, $J_{0,\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_{0} L J_{0,\\mathrm{crit}}}{4 B_{z0}} = 2\\pi $$\nFinally, we solve for $J_{0,\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$ J_{0,\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{8\\pi B_{z0}}{\\mu_{0} L} $$\nThis result can be verified using the safety factor.

The system is unstable if any physically permissible perturbation $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ exists for which $\\delta W  0$. The kink instability is a macroscopic helical deformation of the plasma column, characterized by a poloidal mode number $m=1$.\n\nThe problem distinguishes between two types of kink modes: internal and external.\n\n1.  **External Kink Mode:** This mode involves the displacement of the entire plasma column, including its boundary surface at $r=a$. For a periodic or infinitely long cylinder, the famous Kruskal-Shafranov stability criterion states that the external $m=1$ kink mode is unstable if the safety factor at the edge, $q(a)$, falls below unity for the longest wavelength axial mode (conventionally, $n=1$). The criterion is $q(a)  1$. In this problem, we are given $q(a)=1.3$, which is greater than $1$. Therefore, based on the simple Kruskal-Shafranov criterion, the external kink mode is stable.\n\n    Furthermore, the problem specifies that the loop is **line-tied** at its ends ($z=0, L$). Line-tying imposes a rigid boundary condition that strongly stabilizes global modes like the external kink, as the perturbation cannot be a simple long-wavelength helix but must vanish at the ends. This effect significantly raises the instability threshold, meaning $q(a)$ would need to be much lower than $1$ for the mode to become unstable. With $q(a)=1.3$, the external kink is robustly stable.\n\n2.  **Internal Kink Mode:** This mode is driven by the magnetic energy stored *inside* a rational surface. The primary condition for the existence of an instability of poloidal mode number $m$ and axial mode number $n$ is the presence of a corresponding rational surface, $q(r_s) = m/n$, within the plasma volume ($0  r_s  a$). For the fundamental internal kink mode, we consider $m=1$ and the lowest-order axial mode, which for a long loop ($L \\gg a$) corresponds to $n=1$. The required rational surface is thus $q(r_s) = 1$.\n\n    The problem states that the safety factor profile $q(r)$ is monotonic increasing, with $q(0) = 0.8$ and $q(a) = 1.3$. Since $q(0)  1$ and $q(a)  1$, and $q(r)$ is a continuous function, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that there must exist a radius $r_s$ in the interval $0  r_s  a$ where $q(r_s) = 1$.\n\n    The existence of this $q=1$ surface means that the plasma core ($r  r_s$) can be unstable to an $m=1$ helical displacement. The plasma in the outer region ($r  r_s$) where $q  1$ is stable to this mode and effectively acts like a conducting wall, confining the instability to the core. The condition for the ideal internal $m=1$ kink instability is simply that $q(0)$ drop below $1$. Since $q(0) = 0.8$, an ideal internal kink mode is indeed possible.\n\n3.  **Observational Signatures:**\n    -   **Internal Kink:** The instability is localized to the region $r \\le r_s$. The mode structure is a rigid helical displacement of the core, while the displacement rapidly drops to zero for $r  r_s$. This means the loop's central, hottest region will exhibit dynamic motion, but the overall loop axis (defined by its boundary at $r=a$) will show little to no large-scale, coherent writhing or displacement. The strong shear and compression within the perturbed core can drive current sheet formation and magnetic reconnection, leading to rapid, impulsive heating. This would be observed as a brightening localized to the core of the loop in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) or soft X-ray (SXR) images.\n    -   **External Kink:** In contrast, if this mode were unstable, the displacement would be largest at the plasma edge ($r=a$). This would manifest as a significant, large-amplitude helical deformation (writhing) of the entire loop structure. This global deformation can lead to the loop expanding and potentially erupting, possibly initiating a flare or a coronal mass ejection (CME).\n\n**Conclusion:** The configuration is stable to the external kink mode but unstable to the ideal internal kink mode. The observational signatures of these two modes are distinct, as described above.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. An ideal $m=1$ internal kink is possible because there exists a radius $r_{s}$ with $q(r_{s})=1$ inside the loop; the external kink is stabilized since $q(a)1$ and line-tying raises the global kink threshold. Observationally, the internal kink produces a helical current sheet and impulsive heating localized near the loop core with little net displacement or writhing of the loop axis, whereas an external kink produces a coherent, large-amplitude helical deformation of the entire loop axis and can lead to eruption.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement is fully consistent with the derivation above. It correctly identifies that the condition for the internal kink, $q(0)1$, is met, leading to a $q=1$ surface. It correctly states that the external kink is stable because $q(a)1$, and correctly notes the additional stabilizing effect of line-tying. The description of the observational signatures for both internal (localized core heating, little axis motion) and external (global writhing, eruption) modes is accurate.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. No ideal kink can occur because $q(a)1$; any kink instability requires $q(a)1$. Observationally, only small-amplitude Alfvénic oscillations without reconnection or significant heating would be expected.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement is fundamentally flawed. It incorrectly applies the stability criterion for the *external* kink ($q(a)1$) to *all* kink modes. It completely ignores the possibility of the *internal* kink mode, which depends on $q(0)$, not $q(a)$. As demonstrated, the conditions for an internal kink are met.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Both internal and external ideal kinks are simultaneously unstable whenever $q(0)1$, regardless of $q(a)$. Observationally, one expects global loop-axis writhing together with core heating and an inevitable eruption.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. The stability of the external kink is critically dependent on $q(a)$. The assertion that it is unstable \"regardless of $q(a)$\" is false. Given $q(a)=1.3$, the external kink is stable. Therefore, the two modes are not simultaneously unstable.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. An ideal internal kink requires $q(a)1$; with $q(a)=1.3$ only slow resistive tearing can occur. Observationally, this would manifest as a slow, global S-shaped deformation without localized core heating.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement makes two incorrect claims. First, it falsely states that the ideal internal kink requires $q(a)1$; the correct condition relates to $q(0)1$. Second, it incorrectly concludes that only slow resistive tearing can occur. The ideal internal kink is energetically favored and possible under the given conditions, and it would grow on a much faster (ideal Alfvèn) timescale than a resistive tearing mode. The observational description is also inconsistent with an internal kink.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
