Let $s$ denote the arclength coordinate along the magnetic field line, with $s=0$ at the field minimum, and let the magnetic field magnitude be given locally by $B(s) = B_{0}\\left(1 + \\epsilon s^{2}\\right)$, where $B_{0} > 0$ is the field value at $s=0$ and $\\epsilon > 0$ is a small parameter quantifying the local curvature of $B(s)$ about the minimum.
