It presents a standard calculation in the kinetic theory of plasma waves, using established definitions and principles from astrophysical plasma physics. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.

We start with the standard generating function for the modified Bessel functions $I_n(z)$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{z}{2}\\left(t + \\frac{1}{t}\\right)\\right) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} t^n I_n(z).\n$$\nBy setting the parameter $t=1$, which is a valid choice, the generating function simplifies to a sum over all harmonics:\n$$\n\\exp(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} I_n(z).\n$$\nWe can split the sum over all integers $n$ into three parts: a sum over negative integers, the term for $n=0$, and a sum over positive integers:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} I_n(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-1} I_n(z) + I_0(z) + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n(z).\n$$\nUsing the property that $I_{-n}(z) = I_n(z)$ for integer $n$, the sum over negative indices can be rewritten by letting $k = -n$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-1} I_n(z) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} I_{-k}(z) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} I_k(z).\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\exp(z)$, we get\n$$\n\\exp(z) = \\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n(z)\\right) + I_0(z) + \\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n(z)\\right) = I_0(z) + 2 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n(z).\n$$\nThis identity can be rearranged to give a closed form for the sum over all positive harmonics:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n(z) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\exp(z) - I_0(z)).\n$$\nThe sum required for $Q(b)$ starts from $n=2$. We can express this sum by subtracting the $n=1$ term from the sum over all positive harmonics:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} I_n(b) = \\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n(b)\\right) - I_1(b).\n$$\nSubstituting the identity we derived, with argument $z=b$, we find\n$$\n\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} I_n(b) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\exp(b) - I_0(b)) - I_1(b).\n$$\nNow, we can insert this result into the numerator of our expression for $Q(b)$ to obtain the final closed-form expression:\n$$\nQ(b) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(\\exp(b) - I_0(b)) - I_1(b)}{I_1(b)} = \\frac{\\exp(b) - I_0(b) - 2I_1(b)}{2I_1(b)},\n$$\nwhich can also be written in the alternative form\n$$\nQ(b) = \\frac{\\exp(b)}{2I_1(b)} - \\frac{I_0(b)}{2I_1(b)} - 1.\n$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for $Q(b)$ in terms of $b$, $I_0(b)$, $I_1(b)$, and elementary functions.\n\nNext, we evaluate $Q(b)$ at the specified point. The parameter $b$ is defined as $b \\equiv k_{\\perp}^2 \\rho_i^2$. We are asked to evaluate for the case $k_{\\perp} \\rho_i = 1$, which implies $b = 1^2 = 1$.

This happens when the value of $Q(b)$ is not small compared to $1$. We examine the asymptotic behavior of $Q(b)$.\nFor small $b$ (corresponding to long perpendicular wavelengths, $k_{\\perp}\\rho_i \\ll 1$), we use the series expansion $I_n(b) \\approx (b/2)^n / n!$.\nThen $Q(b) \\approx I_2(b)/I_1(b) \\approx \\frac{(b/2)^2/2!}{(b/2)/1!} = \\frac{b^2/8}{b/2} = \\frac{b}{4}$.\nSince $b \\ll 1$, we have $Q(b) \\ll 1$, and the higher harmonics are negligible.\nFor large $b$ (corresponding to short perpendicular wavelengths, $k_{\\perp}\\rho_i \\gg 1$), we use the asymptotic expansion $I_n(b) \\approx \\exp(b) / \\sqrt{2\\pi b}$ for fixed $n$.\nOur expression for $Q(b)$ becomes:\n$$\nQ(b) \\approx \\frac{\\exp(b)}{2(\\exp(b)/\\sqrt{2\\pi b})} - \\frac{\\exp(b)/\\sqrt{2\\pi b}}{2(\\exp(b)/\\sqrt{2\\pi b})} - 1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi b}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} - 1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi b}{2}} - \\frac{3}{2}.\n$$\nThis expression grows as $\\sqrt{b}$, so for large $b$, $Q(b)$ becomes large, indicating that the higher harmonics dominate over the fundamental.\nTherefore, the $n > 1$ harmonics become non-negligible when $b$ is of order unity or greater ($b \\gtrsim 1$). This corresponds physically to when the perpendicular wavelength $\\lambda_{\\perp} = 2\\pi/k_{\\perp}$ becomes comparable to or smaller than the ion gyro-radius $\\rho_i$. At this scale, the wave can resolve the spatial structure of the ion's gyromotion, making resonant interaction with the higher harmonics of this motion significant. Our result of $Q(1) \\approx 0.2848$ confirms that at $b=1$, the higher harmonics contribute a substantial, non-negligible fraction of the interaction.",

For a left-hand polarized wave, the dispersion relation is given by $D(k_{\\parallel}, \\omega) = 0$, where:\n$$ D(k_{\\parallel}, \\omega) = \\frac{k_{\\parallel}^2 c^2}{\\omega^2} - \\epsilon_L(k_{\\parallel}, \\omega) = 0 $$\nHere, $k_{\\parallel}$ is the parallel wavenumber, $\\omega$ is the wave angular frequency, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\epsilon_L$ is the left-hand polarized component of the dielectric tensor.\n\nFor a plasma with multiple ion species $s$ having isotropic Maxwellian velocity distributions, $\\epsilon_L$ is given by:\n$$ \\epsilon_L(k_{\\parallel}, \\omega) = 1 + \\sum_s \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega k_{\\parallel} v_{\\mathrm{th},s}} Z(\\xi_s) $$\nThe sum is over all plasma species (protons and alphas, in this case, as electrons are ignored). $Z(\\xi_s)$ is the plasma dispersion function, defined as:\n$$ Z(\\xi_s) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\exp(-x^2)}{x - \\xi_s} dx $$\nwhere the argument is the resonance parameter $\\xi_s = (\\omega - \\Omega_s) / (k_{\\parallel} v_{\\mathrm{th},s})$. The integral is handled using the Landau prescription, which gives rise to an imaginary part for real $\\xi_s$:\n$$ \\text{Im}[Z(\\xi_s)] = \\sqrt{\\pi} \\exp(-\\xi_s^2) $$\nThe imaginary part of the dielectric constant, $\\text{Im}[\\epsilon_L]$, is responsible for wave damping or growth.

The real part gives the undamped dispersion relation, $D_r(\\omega_r) = 0$. The imaginary part gives the damping rate:\n$$ \\gamma = -\\frac{D_i(\\omega_r)}{\\partial D_r / \\partial \\omega_r} = \\frac{\\sum_s \\text{Im}[\\epsilon_{L,s}]}{\\partial D_r / \\partial \\omega_r} $$\nThe contribution to the total damping rate from species $s$, which we denote $\\gamma_s$, is:\n$$ \\gamma_s = \\frac{\\text{Im}[\\epsilon_{L,s}]}{\\partial D_r / \\partial \\omega_r} = \\frac{1}{\\partial D_r / \\partial \\omega_r} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi} \\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega_r k_{\\parallel} v_{\\mathrm{th},s}} \\exp(-\\xi_s^2) \\right) $$\nThe term $\\partial D_r / \\partial \\omega_r$ depends on the properties of the undamped wave and is the same for all species. Therefore, the leading-order scaling of the damping contribution from species $s$ is:\n$$ \\gamma_s \\propto \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{v_{\\mathrm{th},s}} \\exp(-\\xi_s^2) $$\nThis fulfills the second part of the task.\n\nNow we compute the ratio $\\gamma_{\\alpha}/\\gamma_p$. The common prefactors, including $\\partial D_r / \\partial \\omega_r$, $\\sqrt{\\pi}$, $\\omega_r$, and $k_{\\parallel}$, cancel out:\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma_{\\alpha}}{\\gamma_p} = \\frac{\\frac{\\omega_{p\\alpha}^2}{v_{\\mathrm{th},\\alpha}} \\exp(-\\xi_{\\alpha}^2)}{\\frac{\\omega_{pp}^2}{v_{\\mathrm{th},p}} \\exp(-\\xi_p^2)} = \\left( \\frac{\\omega_{p\\alpha}^2}{\\omega_{pp}^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{th},p}}{v_{\\mathrm{th},\\alpha}} \\right) \\exp(\\xi_p^2 - \\xi_{\\alpha}^2) $$\nWe evaluate each term in this expression using the given parameters.\n\n1.  **Ratio of squared plasma frequencies:**\n    $$ \\frac{\\omega_{p\\alpha}^2}{\\omega_{pp}^2} = \\frac{n_{\\alpha} q_{\\alpha}^2 / m_{\\alpha}}{n_p q_p^2 / m_p} = \\left(\\frac{n_{\\alpha}}{n_p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q_{\\alpha}}{q_p}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{m_p}{m_{\\alpha}}\\right) $$\n    Using the givens $n_{\\alpha}/n_p = 0.05$, $q_{\\alpha}/q_p = 2e/e = 2$, and $m_{\\alpha}/m_p = 4$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\omega_{p\\alpha}^2}{\\omega_{pp}^2} = (0.05) \\cdot (2)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = 0.05 \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = 0.05 $$\n\n2.  **Ratio of thermal speeds:**\n    Given $T_{\\alpha} = T_p$ and $m_{\\alpha} = 4 m_p$:\n    $$ \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{th},\\alpha}}{v_{\\mathrm{th},p}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 k_B T_{\\alpha} / m_{\\alpha}}}{\\sqrt{2 k_B T_p / m_p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{T_{\\alpha}}{T_p} \\frac{m_p}{m_{\\alpha}}} = \\sqrt{1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n    Thus, the inverse ratio is $v_{\\mathrm{th},p}/v_{\\mathrm{th},\\alpha} = 2$.\n\n3.  **Proton resonance parameter $\\xi_p$:**\n    $$ \\xi_p = \\frac{\\omega - \\Omega_p}{k_{\\parallel} v_{\\mathrm{th},p}} $$\n    Using $\\omega = 0.9 \\Omega_p$ and $k_{\\parallel} v_{\\mathrm{th},p} = 0.3 \\Omega_p$:\n    $$ \\xi_p = \\frac{0.9 \\Omega_p - \\Omega_p}{0.3 \\Omega_p} = \\frac{-0.1 \\Omega_p}{0.3 \\Omega_p} = -\\frac{1}{3} $$\n\n4.  **Alpha-particle resonance parameter $\\xi_{\\alpha}$:**\n    $$ \\xi_{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\omega - \\Omega_{\\alpha}}{k_{\\parallel} v_{\\mathrm{th},\\alpha}} $$\n    First, find $\\Omega_{\\alpha}$ in terms of $\\Omega_p$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Omega_{\\alpha}}{\\Omega_p} = \\frac{q_{\\alpha}/m_{\\alpha}}{q_p/m_p} = \\left(\\frac{q_{\\alpha}}{q_p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{m_p}{m_{\\alpha}}\\right) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\Omega_{\\alpha} = 0.5 \\Omega_p $$\n    Next, find the denominator $k_{\\parallel} v_{\\mathrm{th},\\alpha}$:\n    $$ k_{\\parallel} v_{\\mathrm{th},\\alpha} = k_{\\parallel} \\left(\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{th},p}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (k_{\\parallel} v_{\\mathrm{th},p}) = \\frac{1}{2} (0.3 \\Omega_p) = 0.15 \\Omega_p $$\n    Now, calculate $\\xi_{\\alpha}$:\n    $$ \\xi_{\\alpha} = \\frac{0.9 \\Omega_p - 0.5 \\Omega_p}{0.15 \\Omega_p} = \\frac{0.4 \\Omega_p}{0.15 \\Omega_p} = \\frac{0.4}{0.15} = \\frac{40}{15} = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute these values into the ratio expression:\n    $$ \\frac{\\gamma_{\\alpha}}{\\gamma_p} = (0.05) \\cdot (2) \\cdot \\exp\\left( \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right)^2 \\right) $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\gamma_{\\alpha}}{\\gamma_p} = 0.1 \\cdot \\exp\\left( \\frac{1}{9} - \\frac{64}{9} \\right) = 0.1 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{63}{9}\\right) $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\gamma_{\\alpha}}{\\gamma_p} = 0.1 \\cdot \\exp(-7) $$\n    Now, we compute the numerical value:\n    $$ \\exp(-7) \\approx 0.000911881965... $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\gamma_{\\alpha}}{\\gamma_p} \\approx 0.1 \\times 0.000911881965 = 0.0000911881965... $$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, we get $0.0000912$.",
