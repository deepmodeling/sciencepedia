            "solution": "We will first derive the scaling for the inflow Alfvén Mach number, $M_A$, in the Sweet–Parker model. Then, we will use the provided scaling for the Petschek model. Finally, we will compute their ratio for the given Lundquist number and discuss the astrophysical implications.\n\n1. Derivation of the Sweet–Parker Reconnection Rate\n\nThe Sweet–Parker model assumes a steady-state reconnection layer that is elongated, with a half-length $L$ and a very small half-thickness $\\delta$.\n\nFirst, we consider Ohm's law in the resistive MHD framework: $\\boldsymbol{E} + \\boldsymbol{v}\\times \\boldsymbol{B} = \\eta \\boldsymbol{J}$. In a steady state ($\\partial/\\partial t = 0$), Faraday's law, $\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{E} = 0$, implies that the reconnection electric field, $\\boldsymbol{E} = E_z \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$, must be spatially uniform. In the ideal upstream region, the resistive term is negligible, so $E_z \\approx |\\boldsymbol{v} \\times \\boldsymbol{B}| = v_{\\mathrm{in}} B$. At the magnetic null point (the \"X-point\") in the center of the diffusion region, the plasma velocity $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and magnetic field $\\boldsymbol{B}$ are both zero, so the convective term $\\boldsymbol{v} \\times \\boldsymbol{B}$ vanishes. Here, Ohm's law simplifies to $E_z = \\eta J_z$. Equating the expressions for $E_z$ from the ideal inflow region and the resistive X-point gives the relation:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{in}} B = \\eta J_z\n$$\nThe current density $J_z$ is confined within the current sheet of half-thickness $\\delta$. Using a scaling argument from Ampère's law, $\\mu_{0}\\boldsymbol{J} = \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B}$, the current density required to reverse the magnetic field $B$ over a distance $2\\delta$ is of the order $J_z \\sim B/(\\mu_{0}\\delta)$. Substituting this into our previous relation:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{in}} B \\sim \\eta \\frac{B}{\\mu_0 \\delta} \\implies v_{\\mathrm{in}} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0 \\delta}\n$$\nNext, we apply the principle of mass conservation to the diffusion region, which has approximate dimensions $2L \\times 2\\delta$. The rate of mass flowing into the region must balance the rate of mass flowing out.\nMass inflow rate: $\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\rho (2L) v_{\\mathrm{in}}$ (per unit length in the $z$-direction).\nMass outflow rate: $\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{out}} (2\\delta) v_{\\mathrm{out}}$. In the Sweet–Parker model, it is assumed that the plasma is accelerated to the local Alfvén speed in the outflow jet, $v_{\\mathrm{out}} \\sim V_A$. We also assume incompressibility for this scaling, so $\\rho_{\\mathrm{out}} \\sim \\rho$.\nEquating the fluxes, $\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$\n\\rho (2L) v_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\rho (2\\delta) V_A \\implies \\frac{\\delta}{L} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{in}}}{V_A}\n$$\nThe ratio $\\delta/L$ is the aspect ratio of the reconnection layer. We can express this using the inflow Alfvén Mach number, $M_A \\equiv v_{\\mathrm{in}}/V_A$, as $\\delta/L = M_A$. From this, we find the half-thickness $\\delta = L M_A$.\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\delta$ back into our result from Ohm's law:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{in}} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0 (L M_A)}\n$$\nReplacing $v_{\\mathrm{in}}$ with $M_A V_A$:\n$$\nM_A V_A \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0 L M_A}\n$$\nSolving for $M_A$:\n$$\nM_A^2 \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0 L V_A}\n$$\nWe recognize the term on the right as the inverse of the Lundquist number, $S \\equiv \\mu_0 L V_A / \\eta$. Thus, we obtain the Sweet–Parker scaling:\n$$\nM_{A,\\mathrm{Sweet\\text{--}Parker}} \\sim S^{-1/2}\n$$\nFor our calculation, we take the leading-order coefficient to be $1$, so $M_{A,\\mathrm{Sweet\\text{--}Parker}} = S^{-1/2}$.\n\n2. The Petschek Reconnection Rate\n\nThe Petschek model differs fundamentally by postulating a much more compact diffusion region, from which four standing slow-mode shocks propagate into the ideal MHD plasma. The bulk of the energy conversion occurs at these shocks, not in the central diffusion region. The problem asks us to use the result from asymptotic matching arguments between the inner resistive layer and the outer ideal region. This analysis, pioneered by Petschek and later formalized by Vasyliunas, shows that the reconnection rate is much less sensitive to resistivity. The problem states that the leading-order result is:\n$$\nM_{A,\\mathrm{Petschek}} = \\frac{C}{\\ln S}\n$$\nwith the classical uniform-resistivity coefficient $C = \\pi/8$.\n\n3. Calculation of the Ratio $\\mathcal{R}$\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $\\mathcal{R} \\equiv M_{A,\\mathrm{Petschek}}/M_{A,\\mathrm{Sweet\\text{--}Parker}}$ for a Lundquist number $S = 10^6$.\nUsing the derived and given expressions:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{M_{A,\\mathrm{Petschek}}}{M_{A,\\mathrm{Sweet\\text{--}Parker}}} = \\frac{(\\pi/8) / \\ln S}{S^{-1/2}} = \\frac{\\pi S^{1/2}}{8 \\ln S}\n$$\nSubstituting $S = 10^6$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\pi (10^6)^{1/2}}{8 \\ln(10^6)} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 10^3}{8 \\times 6 \\ln(10)} = \\frac{1000 \\pi}{48 \\ln(10)} = \\frac{125 \\pi}{6 \\ln(10)}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} \\approx \\frac{125 \\times 3.14159265}{6 \\times 2.30258509} \\approx \\frac{392.69908}{13.8155105} \\approx 28.42445\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\mathcal{R} = 28.42$.\n\n4. Astrophysical Implication\n\nThe reconnection timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ is the time required to process a magnetic flux tube of global length $L$ at the inflow speed $v_{\\mathrm{in}}$, so $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}} = L/v_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The characteristic dynamical time of the system is the global Alfvén time, $\\tau_A \\equiv L/V_A$. The ratio of these timescales is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{\\tau_A} = \\frac{L/v_{\\mathrm{in}}}{L/V_A} = \\frac{V_A}{v_{\\mathrm{in}}} = \\frac{1}{M_A}\n$$\nThis shows that the reconnection timescale is inversely proportional to the Alfvén Mach number $M_A$. A larger $M_A$ implies faster reconnection.\n\nOur calculated ratio $\\mathcal{R} \\approx 28.42$ for $S=10^6$ signifies that the Petschek reconnection rate is over $28$ times faster than the Sweet–Parker rate. This disparity becomes vastly more pronounced in high-Lundquist-number environments like the solar corona (where $S$ can be $10^{12}$ or higher) or magnetar magnetospheres. For $S=10^{12}$, $\\mathcal{R}$ would be on the order of $1.4 \\times 10^4$.\n\nThe astrophysical implication is profound. The Sweet–Parker timescale, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec,SP}} = \\tau_A S^{1/2}$, is excessively long for typical astrophysical parameters. For example, in a solar active region with $\\tau_A \\sim 1\\,\\mathrm{second}$ and $S \\sim 10^{12}$, the Sweet–Parker time would be $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec,SP}} \\sim 10^6\\,\\mathrm{seconds}$, which is about $11.6\\,\\mathrm{days}$. This is far too slow to explain solar flares, which release their energy on timescales of minutes to hours.\n\nThe Petschek mechanism, however, yields a timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec,P}} = \\tau_A (\\ln S)/C$. This rate is referred to as \"fast reconnection\" because it depends only logarithmically on the large Lundquist number $S$, and is therefore nearly independent of resistivity. This weak dependence allows for reconnection to proceed on timescales much closer to the dynamical Alfvén time, which is consistent with the observed rapidity of explosive events like solar flares, stellar flares, and magnetospheric substorms. The large value of $\\mathcal{R}$ quantifies why models of fast reconnection are essential for explaining these ubiquitous and energetic phenomena in the universe.",
