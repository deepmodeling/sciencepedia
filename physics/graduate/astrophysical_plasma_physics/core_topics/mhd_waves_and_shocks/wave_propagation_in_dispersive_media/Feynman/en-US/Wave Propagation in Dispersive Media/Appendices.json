            "problem": "An electrostatic electron plasma wave (Langmuir wave) is excited in an unmagnetized, collisionless astrophysical plasma with uniform electron number density $n_e = 10^{6}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$ and electron temperature $T_e = 10^{5}\\,\\text{K}$. The ions are a stationary, neutralizing background. Consider a monochromatic plane wave with angular frequency $\\omega = 1.1\\,\\omega_{pe}$, where $\\omega_{pe}$ is the electron plasma frequency.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained, thus it is deemed valid. We proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe derivation starts from the linearized electron fluid equations for an unmagnetized, collisionless plasma, coupled with Poisson's equation. The equilibrium state is a uniform plasma with electron number density $n_0$, zero electron fluid velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$, and zero electric field $\\mathbf{E}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$. The ions form a stationary, charge-neutralizing background with density $n_i = n_0$.\n\nWe consider small perturbations from equilibrium:\n$n_e( \\mathbf{r}, t) = n_0 + n_1(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\n$\\mathbf{v}_e(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{v}_1(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\n$\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{E}_1(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\n$P_e(\\mathbf{r}, t) = P_0 + P_1(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\n\nThe fundamental equations are:\n1.  **Continuity Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial n_e}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (n_e \\mathbf{v}_e) = 0$\n2.  **Momentum Equation:** $m_e n_e \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_e}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v}_e \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v}_e\\right) = -e n_e \\mathbf{E} - \\nabla P_e$\n3.  **Poisson's Equation:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{e(n_i - n_e)}{\\varepsilon_0}$\n\nLinearizing these equations by keeping only first-order terms in the perturbations (e.g., $n_1, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{E}_1$) yields:\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial t} + n_0 (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_1) = 0$\n2.  $m_e n_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_1}{\\partial t} = -e n_0 \\mathbf{E}_1 - \\nabla P_1$\n3.  $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_1 = -\\frac{e n_1}{\\varepsilon_0}$\n\nTo close the system, we need an equation of state relating $P_1$ to $n_1$. For the one-dimensional compression characteristic of a Langmuir wave, the process is assumed to be adiabatic, governed by $P_e n_e^{-\\gamma} = \\text{constant}$. Linearizing this relation gives $\\frac{P_1}{P_0} = \\gamma \\frac{n_1}{n_0}$. Using the ideal gas law for the equilibrium pressure, $P_0 = n_0 k_B T_e$, we find the pressure perturbation: $P_1 = \\gamma k_B T_e n_1$. For one-dimensional longitudinal waves, kinetic theory justifies the use of an adiabatic index $\\gamma = 3$. Thus, $\\nabla P_1 = 3 k_B T_e \\nabla n_1$.\n\nWe seek plane wave solutions of the form $f_1(\\mathbf{r},t) = f_1 \\exp[i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega t)]$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency and $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector. This transforms the differential operators as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\to -i\\omega$ and $\\nabla \\to i\\mathbf{k}$. Since Langmuir waves are longitudinal, $\\mathbf{k} \\parallel \\mathbf{E}_1$, and we can treat the vector quantities as scalars ($k$, $v_1$, $E_1$) along the direction of propagation.\n\nThe linearized equations in Fourier space become:\n1.  $-i\\omega n_1 + i k n_0 v_1 = 0 \\implies \\omega n_1 = k n_0 v_1$\n2.  $-i\\omega m_e n_0 v_1 = -e n_0 E_1 - i k (3 k_B T_e n_1)$\n3.  $i k E_1 = -\\frac{e n_1}{\\varepsilon_0} \\implies E_1 = \\frac{i e n_1}{k \\varepsilon_0}$\n\nNow, we combine these algebraic equations to find the dispersion relation $\\omega(k)$.\nFrom (1), we express the velocity perturbation as $v_1 = \\frac{\\omega n_1}{k n_0}$.\nSubstitute the expression for $E_1$ from (3) into (2):\n$-i\\omega m_e n_0 v_1 = -e n_0 \\left(\\frac{i e n_1}{k \\varepsilon_0}\\right) - i k (3 k_B T_e n_1)$\n\nDividing by $-i n_1$ (assuming a non-trivial wave, $n_1 \\neq 0$):\n$\\omega m_e n_0 \\frac{v_1}{n_1} = \\frac{e^2 n_0}{k \\varepsilon_0} + 3 k k_B T_e$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $v_1/n_1 = \\omega/(k n_0)$ from (1):\n$\\omega m_e n_0 \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{k n_0}\\right) = \\frac{e^2 n_0}{k \\varepsilon_0} + 3 k k_B T_e$\n\n$\\frac{\\omega^2 m_e}{k} = \\frac{e^2 n_0}{k \\varepsilon_0} + 3 k k_B T_e$\n\nMultiplying by $k/m_e$ gives:\n$\\omega^2 = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_e} + 3 \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_e} k^2$\n\nThis is the Bohm-Gross dispersion relation for Langmuir waves, including the leading-order thermal correction. The first term is the square of the electron plasma frequency, $\\omega_{pe}^2 = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_e}$. We can also define a characteristic electron thermal velocity squared as $v_{th}^2 = k_B T_e/m_e$. The dispersion relation is thus:\n$\\omega^2 = \\omega_{pe}^2 + 3 v_{th}^2 k^2$\n\nNow we proceed with the numerical calculation. First, we convert the electron density to SI units:\n$n_e = 10^6 \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} = 10^6 \\times (10^{-2} \\, \\text{m})^{-3} = 10^{12} \\, \\text{m}^{-3}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the electron plasma frequency squared, using the provided constants:\n$\\omega_{pe}^2 = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_e} = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\text{m}^{-3}) (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C})^2}{(8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{F m}^{-1})(9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg})}$\n$\\omega_{pe}^2 \\approx 3.18029 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{s}^{-2}$\n\nThe problem states $\\omega = 1.1\\,\\omega_{pe}$, so $\\omega^2 = (1.1)^2 \\omega_{pe}^2 = 1.21\\,\\omega_{pe}^2$.\nWe rearrange the dispersion relation to solve for the wavenumber $k$:\n$k^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2 - \\omega_{pe}^2}{3 v_{th}^2} = \\frac{1.21\\,\\omega_{pe}^2 - \\omega_{pe}^2}{3(k_B T_e / m_e)} = \\frac{0.21\\,\\omega_{pe}^2}{3(k_B T_e / m_e)} = 0.07 \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2 m_e}{k_B T_e}$\n\nLet's calculate the value of $k^2$:\n$k_B T_e = (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J K}^{-1})(10^5 \\, \\text{K}) = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}$\n$k^2 = 0.07 \\frac{(3.18029 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{s}^{-2})(9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg})}{1.380649 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}} \\approx 146.882 \\, \\text{m}^{-2}$\n\nThe wavenumber $k$ is the positive root:\n$k = \\sqrt{146.882} \\approx 12.1195 \\, \\text{m}^{-1}$\n\nThe wavelength $\\lambda$ is given by $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k$:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{12.1195 \\, \\text{m}^{-1}} \\approx 0.51843 \\, \\text{m}$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the wavelength is $0.518 \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the validity of the warm correction and the fluid model. The fluid approximation requires that the wavelength of the phenomenon be much larger than the Debye length, $\\lambda \\gg \\lambda_D$. This condition is expressed as $k\\lambda_D \\ll 1$. The Debye length $\\lambda_D$ is given by $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}}$.\nWe can relate $k\\lambda_D$ directly to the parameters of the problem. From the dispersion relation:\n$\\omega^2 = \\omega_{pe}^2 (1 + 3 \\frac{k^2 v_{th}^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2}) = \\omega_{pe}^2 (1 + 3 k^2 (\\frac{v_{th}}{\\omega_{pe}})^2)$\nRecognizing that $\\lambda_D = v_{th}/\\omega_{pe}$, this becomes:\n$\\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2} = 1 + 3 (k\\lambda_D)^2$\nSolving for $k\\lambda_D$:\n$k\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2} - 1\\right)}$\n\nUsing the given $\\omega = 1.1\\,\\omega_{pe}$:\n$k\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}\\left((1.1)^2 - 1\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.21}{3}} = \\sqrt{0.07} \\approx 0.265$\n\nThe value $k\\lambda_D \\approx 0.265$ is less than $1$, but it is not \"much less than 1\". This indicates that the system is on the borderline of the fluid model's validity. When $k\\lambda_D$ is not small, kinetic effects that are ignored in the fluid model become important. The most significant of these is collisionless (Landau) damping. This damping arises from the resonant interaction of electrons with the wave, which occurs when the wave's phase velocity, $v_{ph} = \\omega/k$, is comparable to the electron thermal velocity.\n\nLet's evaluate the ratio of the phase velocity to the thermal velocity:\n$\\frac{v_{ph}}{v_{th}} = \\frac{\\omega/k}{v_{th}} = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{pe}} \\frac{\\omega_{pe}}{k v_{th}} = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{pe}} \\frac{1}{k\\lambda_D}$\n$\\frac{v_{ph}}{v_{th}} = \\frac{1.1}{\\sqrt{0.07}} \\approx \\frac{1.1}{0.265} \\approx 4.15$\n\nThe phase velocity is approximately $4.15$ times the thermal velocity. While this is large enough that the bulk of the electrons do not interact with the wave, there is a non-negligible population in the tail of the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution that moves at speeds near $v_{ph}$. These electrons can exchange energy with the wave, leading to damping. Strong Landau damping typically occurs for $v_{ph}/v_{th} \\lesssim 3$. At $v_{ph}/v_{th} \\approx 4.15$, the damping is weak but not zero.\n\nIn conclusion, the thermal correction to the dispersion relation is essential, as it allows for wave propagation at $\\omega > \\omega_{pe}$. However, the very parameters that make the thermal correction significant ($k>0$) also push the system towards a regime where the underlying fluid model is only marginally valid. A more accurate kinetic treatment would reveal that the wave is damped over time and distance. The calculated wavelength is a valid first-order approximation, but the assumption of a purely real $\\omega$ and $k$ is an idealization.",

We start with Maxwell's curl equations, assuming a time-harmonic dependence of the form $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = i\\omega \\mathbf{B}\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_{0} \\mathbf{J} - i \\frac{\\omega}{c^2} \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nTaking the curl of the first equation and substituting the second gives the wave equation:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = i\\omega (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = i\\omega \\left( \\mu_{0} \\mathbf{J} - i \\frac{\\omega}{c^2} \\mathbf{E} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{E}$ and assuming a transverse wave where $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0$, we get:\n$$\n-\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{E} = i\\omega\\mu_{0}\\mathbf{J} + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nFor a plane wave propagating in the $z$-direction, $\\mathbf{E}(z,t) = \\mathbf{E}(z) \\exp(-i\\omega t)$, the spatial operator becomes $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{d^2}{dz^2}$. In a uniform medium, this would be $-k^2$. The wave equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{E}}{dz^2} + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}\\mathbf{E} + i\\omega\\mu_{0}\\mathbf{J} = 0\n$$\nThe current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is due to the motion of electrons, $\\mathbf{J} = -n_{e}e\\mathbf{v}_{e}$. The electron velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{e}$ is determined by the linearized electron momentum equation with a collisional drag term:\n$$\nm_{e} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_{e}}{\\partial t} = -e\\mathbf{E} - m_{e}\\nu(z)\\mathbf{v}_{e}\n$$\nFor time-harmonic fields, $\\partial/\\partial t \\rightarrow -i\\omega$, so:\n$$\n-i\\omega m_{e}\\mathbf{v}_{e} = -e\\mathbf{E} - m_{e}\\nu(z)\\mathbf{v}_{e}\n$$\nSolving for $\\mathbf{v}_{e}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{e} = \\frac{-e\\mathbf{E}}{m_{e}(\\nu(z) - i\\omega)}\n$$\nThe current density is then $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma(z) \\mathbf{E}$, where the complex conductivity $\\sigma(z)$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma(z) = \\frac{n_{e}e^2}{m_{e}(\\nu(z) - i\\omega)} = \\frac{n_{e}e^2}{m_{e}(-i)(\\omega + i\\nu(z))} = \\frac{i n_{e}e^2}{m_{e}(\\omega + i\\nu(z))}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}$ into the wave equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{E}}{dz^2} + \\left( \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} + i\\omega\\mu_{0}\\sigma(z) \\right) \\mathbf{E} = 0\n$$\nThis is a Helmholtz-type equation with a position-dependent wavenumber $k(z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{E}}{dz^2} + k^2(z)\\mathbf{E} = 0\n$$\nwhere the local dispersion relation is given by $k^2(z)$. Using $\\omega_p^2 = n_{e}e^2/(\\varepsilon_{0}m_{e})$ and $c^2=1/(\\mu_{0}\\varepsilon_{0})$:\n$$\nk^2(z) = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} + i\\omega\\mu_{0} \\frac{i\\varepsilon_{0}\\omega_p^2}{\\omega+i\\nu(z)} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} - \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega(\\omega+i\\nu(z))}\n$$\nSo, the complex dispersion relation is:\n$$\nk^2(z) = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2 + i\\omega\\nu(z)} \\right)\n$$\nThis can be written as $k^2(z) = (\\omega/c)^2 \\epsilon_r(\\omega, z)$, where $\\epsilon_r$ is the complex relative permittivity.\n\nThe problem states that the WKB approximation is applicable and we are in the weak-damping limit, $\\nu(z)/\\omega \\ll 1$ for all $z \\in [0, L]$. We can expand the permittivity:\n$$\n\\epsilon_r(z) = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2(1+i\\nu(z)/\\omega)} \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}\\left(1 - i\\frac{\\nu(z)}{\\omega}\\right) = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}\\right) + i \\frac{\\omega_p^2 \\nu(z)}{\\omega^3}\n$$\nThe local wavenumber is $k(z) = \\frac{\\omega}{c}\\sqrt{\\epsilon_r(z)}$. Since $\\omega > \\omega_p$, the real part of $\\epsilon_r$ is positive. Let $n_r^2 = 1 - \\omega_p^2/\\omega^2$, where $n_r$ is the refractive index in the collisionless limit. As stated in the problem, we can treat $n_r$ as constant.\n$$\nk(z) \\approx \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\sqrt{n_r^2 + i \\frac{\\omega_p^2 \\nu(z)}{\\omega^3}} = \\frac{\\omega}{c} n_r \\sqrt{1 + i \\frac{\\omega_p^2 \\nu(z)}{n_r^2 \\omega^3}}\n$$\nUsing the approximation $\\sqrt{1+x} \\approx 1+x/2$ for small $x$, we get:\n$$\nk(z) \\approx \\frac{\\omega}{c} n_r \\left( 1 + \\frac{i}{2} \\frac{\\omega_p^2 \\nu(z)}{n_r^2 \\omega^3} \\right) = \\frac{\\omega}{c} n_r + i \\frac{\\omega_p^2 \\nu(z)}{2 c \\omega^2 n_r}\n$$\nThe wavenumber is $k(z) = k_r + i k_i(z)$, where the real part $k_r = \\frac{\\omega}{c}n_r$ is constant and the imaginary part $k_i(z)$ is:\n$$\nk_i(z) = \\frac{\\omega_p^2 \\nu(z)}{2 c \\omega^2 n_r} = \\frac{\\omega_p^2 \\nu(z)}{2 c \\omega^2 \\sqrt{1 - \\omega_p^2/\\omega^2}}\n$$\nIn the WKB approximation, the leading-order solution for the field amplitude evolves as $|E(z)| \\propto \\exp(-\\int k_i(z) dz)$. The problem asks for the attenuation factor $\\mathcal{A} \\equiv |E(L)|/|E(0^+)|$. Under the assumption that the real part of the refractive index is constant, the WKB pre-factor related to energy conservation is constant, so we have:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} = \\frac{|E(L)|}{|E(0^+)|} = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^L k_i(z) dz\\right)\n$$\nWe now compute the integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^L k_i(z) dz = \\int_0^L \\frac{\\omega_p^2 \\nu(z)}{2 c \\omega^2 \\sqrt{1 - \\omega_p^2/\\omega^2}} dz = \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{2 c \\omega^2 \\sqrt{1 - \\omega_p^2/\\omega^2}} \\int_0^L \\nu(z) dz\n$$\nUsing the given collision frequency profile $\\nu(z) = \\nu_{0}\\exp(-z/H)$:\n$$\n\\int_0^L \\nu(z) dz = \\int_0^L \\nu_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{H}\\right) dz = \\nu_0 \\left[ -H \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{H}\\right) \\right]_0^L\n$$\n$$\n= \\nu_0 \\left( -H \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{H}\\right) - (-H \\exp(0)) \\right) = \\nu_0 H \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{H}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the attenuation factor $\\mathcal{A}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{2 c \\omega^2 \\sqrt{1 - \\omega_p^2/\\omega^2}} \\cdot \\nu_0 H \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{H}\\right)\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the attenuation factor in terms of the given parameters. The expression can be slightly re-arranged for clarity:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{\\omega_p^2 \\nu_0 H}{2 c \\omega^2 \\sqrt{1 - \\omega_p^2/\\omega^2}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{H}\\right)\\right) \\right)\n$$",
