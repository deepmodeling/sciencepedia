            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard exercise in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) that tests both theoretical derivation and application. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts. First, we derive the general form of the magnetic force density and its relationship to magnetic pressure and tension. Second, we apply this framework to a specific two-dimensional magnetic field.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Magnetic Force Decomposition and Tension Magnitude**\n\nWe begin with the magnetic part of the Lorentz force density, which in the CGS (Gaussian) system of units is given by\n$$\n\\mathbf{f}_m = \\frac{1}{c}\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{J}$ is the electric current density, $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field, and $c$ is the speed of light. For an ideal plasma under magnetostatic or quasi-static conditions, we can relate the current density to the magnetic field using Ampere's law (neglecting the displacement current):\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{4\\pi}{c}\\mathbf{J} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\mathbf{J} = \\frac{c}{4\\pi}\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\mathbf{J}$ into the force density equation, we get\n$$\n\\mathbf{f}_m = \\frac{1}{c} \\left(\\frac{c}{4\\pi}\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right) \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nWe employ the standard vector calculus identity $\\mathbf{A} \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\frac{1}{2}A^2) - (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{A}$. Letting $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{B}$, the force expression becomes\n$$\n\\mathbf{f}_m = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\mathbf{B} \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\nabla\\left(\\frac{B^2}{2}\\right) - (\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{B} \\right]\n$$\nwhere $B = |\\mathbf{B}|$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field. Rearranging the terms, we arrive at the desired decomposition:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f}_m = -\\nabla\\left(\\frac{B^2}{8\\pi}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4\\pi}(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis expression decomposes the magnetic force density into two distinct parts. The first term, $-\\nabla(B^2/8\\pi)$, is the gradient of an isotropic pressure, where $P_m = B^2/8\\pi$ is the magnetic pressure. The second term, $\\mathbf{f}_t = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{B}$, is identified as the magnetic tension force density.\n\nTo relate the tension force to the geometry of the magnetic field lines, we introduce the unit vector tangent to the field lines, $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\mathbf{B}/B$. We can then write $\\mathbf{B} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$. The tension term can be expanded using the product rule for the directional derivative $(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)$:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{B} = (B\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\cdot \\nabla)(B\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}) = B(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\cdot \\nabla)(B\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}) = B\\left[ \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\cdot \\nabla B) + B(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\cdot \\nabla)\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\right]\n$$\nThe quantity $(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\cdot \\nabla)\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$ is the directional derivative of the unit tangent vector along the field line itself. This is, by definition, the curvature vector of the field line, $\\mathbf{\\kappa}$. The magnitude of the curvature vector is the curvature, $\\kappa = |\\mathbf{\\kappa}| = 1/R_c$, where $R_c$ is the radius of curvature. The curvature vector points towards the center of curvature.\nThe portion of the magnetic force directly associated with the curvature of the field lines is thus\n$$\n\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{tension, curvature}} = \\frac{B^2}{4\\pi}(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\cdot \\nabla)\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\frac{B^2}{4\\pi}\\mathbf{\\kappa}\n$$\nThe magnitude of this tension force per unit volume is therefore\n$$\n|\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{tension, curvature}}| = \\frac{B^2}{4\\pi}|\\mathbf{\\kappa}| = \\frac{B^2}{4\\pi R_c}\n$$\nThis is the required expression. This force acts to straighten bent magnetic field lines, analogous to the tension in a stretched string.\n\n**Part 2: Application to a Specific Magnetic Field**\n\nWe are given a two-dimensional magnetic field specified by the scalar flux function $\\psi(x,y) = B_{0} \\ln(\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}})$. It is convenient to express $\\psi$ in polar coordinates $(r, \\phi)$, where $r=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. Thus, $\\psi(r) = B_0 \\ln(r)$. The magnetic field is given by $\\mathbf{B} = \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\nabla \\psi$.\nThe gradient in polar coordinates is $\\nabla\\psi = \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial r}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\phi}\\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}}$. Since $\\psi$ depends only on $r$, this simplifies to\n$$\n\\nabla\\psi = \\frac{d\\psi}{dr}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = B_0 \\frac{1}{r}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nNow we compute $\\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B} = \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\left( \\frac{B_0}{r} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\right) = \\frac{B_0}{r} (\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) = \\frac{B_0}{r}\\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}}\n$$\nThis describes a purely azimuthal magnetic field whose field lines are concentric circles about the origin, with a magnitude $B(r) = |\\mathbf{B}| = B_0/r$ that decreases inversely with the distance from the origin.\n\nWe now compute the required quantities at the point $(x,y)=(a,0)$, where $a>0$. In polar coordinates, this point is $(r,\\phi)=(a,0)$.\nThe unit vector tangent to the magnetic field is\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{B} = \\frac{(B_0/r)\\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}}}{B_0/r} = \\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}}\n$$\nAt the point $(a,0)$, the Cartesian unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ corresponds to the azimuthal unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}}$. So, $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}(a,0) = \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\n\nThe curvature vector is $\\mathbf{\\kappa} = (\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\cdot \\nabla)\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$. Using $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}}$ and the gradient operator in polar coordinates, the directional derivative is\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} \\cdot \\nabla = \\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}} \\cdot \\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}}\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\right) = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\n$$\nApplying this to $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$, we find the curvature vector:\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\kappa} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}(\\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}})\n$$\nThe derivative of the azimuthal unit vector with respect to the angle is $\\frac{\\partial\\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}}}{\\partial\\phi} = -\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\kappa} = -\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}{r}\n$$\nAt the point $(a,0)$, $r=a$ and the radial unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ is simply $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. So, $\\mathbf{\\kappa}(a,0) = -\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}}{a}$.\n\nThe radius of curvature, $R_c$, is the reciprocal of the curvature magnitude $\\kappa=|\\mathbf{\\kappa}|$:\n$$\nR_c = \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{\\kappa}|} = \\frac{1}{|-\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}/r|} = r\n$$\nAt the point $(a,0)$, the radius of curvature is $R_c(a,0) = a$. This is expected, as the field line passing through $(a,0)$ is a circle of radius $a$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the magnitude of the magnetic tension force per unit volume at $(a,0)$ using our derived expression:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{f}_t| = \\frac{B^2}{4\\pi R_c}\n$$\nAt $(a,0)$, we have $B = B(a) = B_0/a$ and $R_c = a$. Substituting these gives:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{f}_t|_{(a,0)} = \\frac{(B_0/a)^2}{4\\pi a} = \\frac{B_0^2}{4\\pi a^3}\n$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $B_0 = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}$ Gauss$\\cdot$cm and $a = 1.0 \\times 10^{9}$ cm. The resulting unit will be $\\text{(Gauss}\\cdot\\text{cm})^2/\\text{cm}^3 = \\text{Gauss}^2\\cdot\\text{cm}^{-1} = (\\text{dyne}\\cdot\\text{cm}^{-2})\\cdot\\text{cm}^{-1} = \\text{dyne}\\cdot\\text{cm}^{-3}$.\n$$\n|\\mathbf{f}_t| = \\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^4)^2}{4\\pi (1.0 \\times 10^9)^3} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^8}{4\\pi \\times 10^{27}} = \\frac{25}{4\\pi} \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ dyne}\\cdot\\text{cm}^{-3}\n$$\n$$\n|\\mathbf{f}_t| \\approx 1.9894367... \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ dyne}\\cdot\\text{cm}^{-3}\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the magnitude of the magnetic tension is $1.989 \\times 10^{-19}$ dyne$\\cdot$cm$^{-3}$.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and complete. All parameters are consistent with the physical model of the warm interstellar medium. The tasks requested are standard derivations and interpretations in astrophysical plasma physics.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: first, the derivation of the plasma beta parameter, $\\beta$; second, the numerical calculation of $\\beta$ for the given parameters; and third, the physical interpretation of the result.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Plasma Beta ($\\beta$)**\n\nThe plasma beta parameter, $\\beta$, is fundamentally the ratio of the thermal pressure of the plasma to the magnetic pressure of the embedded magnetic field. We derive these two pressure terms from the specified first principles.\n\nThe thermal pressure, $P_{th}$, of a gas is defined from kinetic theory. For an ideal gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium, which is an appropriate model for a fully collisional gas, the pressure is given by the ideal gas law:\n$$P_{th} = nk_{B}T$$\nwhere $n$ is the total particle number density, $T$ is the temperature, and $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. This pressure is isotropic, meaning it is exerted equally in all directions.\n\nThe magnetic stress is described by the Maxwell stress tensor, $\\mathbf{T}_{M}$. In Gaussian (cgs) units, its components $T_{ij}$ are given by:\n$$T_{ij} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left(E_i E_j + B_i B_j - \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{ij}(E^2 + B^2)\\right)$$\nwhere $\\vec{E}$ is the electric field, $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. For a steady magnetic field in a highly conductive plasma, we can work in a reference frame where the electric field is negligible ($E \\approx 0$), which is a standard assumption in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for non-relativistic flows. The tensor simplifies to the magnetostatic stress tensor:\n$$T_{ij} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left(B_i B_j - \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{ij}B^2\\right)$$\nThe magnetic force per unit volume, $\\vec{f}_m$, exerted on the plasma is the negative divergence of this tensor, $\\vec{f}_m = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{T}_M$. Using vector calculus identities and the Maxwell equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0$, the force density can be decomposed as:\n$$\\vec{f}_m = -\\nabla\\left(\\frac{B^2}{8\\pi}\\right) + \\frac{(\\vec{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\vec{B}}{4\\pi}$$\nThis decomposition reveals two distinct physical effects. The first term, $-\\nabla(B^2/8\\pi)$, is the gradient of a scalar quantity. This term has the mathematical form of a pressure force, where the scalar $P_{mag} = B^2/(8\\pi)$ acts as an isotropic pressure. This is the \"isotropic (pressure-like) part of the magnetic stress\" mentioned in the problem. The second term, $(\\vec{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\vec{B}/(4\\pi)$, represents a force associated with the curvature of the magnetic field lines and is known as magnetic tension.\n\nThe plasma beta parameter, $\\beta$, is defined as the ratio of the thermal pressure to this magnetic pressure:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{P_{th}}{P_{mag}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived from kinetic theory and Maxwell's equations, we obtain the formula for $\\beta$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{nk_{B}T}{B^2 / (8\\pi)} = \\frac{8\\pi nk_{B}T}{B^2}$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of $\\beta$**\n\nWe are given the following parameters in cgs units:\n- Magnetic field magnitude: $B = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{G} = 5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{G}$\n- Total particle number density: $n = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n- Temperature: $T = 8000\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nThe value of the Boltzmann constant in cgs units is $k_{B} \\approx 1.3807 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{erg}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal pressure, $P_{th}$:\n$$P_{th} = n k_{B} T = (0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}) \\times (1.3807 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{erg}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (8000\\,\\mathrm{K})$$\n$$P_{th} = 5.5228 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{erg}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$$\nNote that $1\\,\\mathrm{erg}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{dyne}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, which are the cgs units of pressure.\n\nNext, we calculate the magnetic pressure, $P_{mag}$:\n$$P_{mag} = \\frac{B^2}{8\\pi} = \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{G})^2}{8\\pi} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{G^2}}{8\\pi}$$\nIn Gaussian units, the expression $B^2/(8\\pi)$ with $B$ in Gauss gives the pressure directly in $\\mathrm{erg}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.\n$$P_{mag} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-12}}{8\\pi} \\approx 9.9472 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{erg}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\beta$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{P_{th}}{P_{mag}} = \\frac{5.5228 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{erg}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}}{9.9472 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{erg}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}}$$\n$$\\beta \\approx 0.55523$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested, gives:\n$$\\beta \\approx 0.555$$\n\n**Part 3: Physical Interpretation**\n\nThe plasma beta parameter $\\beta$ compares the relative importance of thermal pressure and magnetic pressure in a plasma.\n- If $\\beta \\gg 1$, the plasma is in a \"high-beta\" state. Thermal pressure dominates over magnetic pressure. The dynamics are fluid-like, and the magnetic field is carried along by the plasma flow.\n- If $\\beta \\ll 1$, the plasma is in a \"low-beta\" state. Magnetic pressure dominates, and the plasma is constrained to move along the relatively rigid magnetic field lines. Magnetic forces control the large-scale dynamics.\n- If $\\beta \\approx 1$, both thermal and magnetic pressures are of comparable magnitude. The dynamics are complex, with a strong coupling between the plasma and the magnetic field. Neither effect can be ignored.\n\nIn this case, we have found that $\\beta \\approx 0.555$. This value is of order unity. It indicates that the thermal pressure is of the same order of magnitude as, though slightly smaller than, the magnetic pressure ($P_{th} \\approx 0.555 \\, P_{mag}$). Therefore, one cannot conclude that the dynamics are controlled solely by thermal pressure or solely by magnetic stresses. Instead, both thermal and magnetic effects are dynamically significant. Magnetic stresses are expected to play a crucial role, comparable to that of thermal pressure gradients, in controlling the large-scale dynamics and structure of this region of the interstellar medium.",

Given the form of the perturbations, this becomes $( (ik)^2 + \\frac{d^2}{dz^2} ) \\hat{P}_1(z) = 0$, or $\\frac{d^2 \\hat{P}_1}{dz^2} = k^2 \\hat{P}_1$.\n\nThe solutions must decay away from the interface at $z=0$.\nIn region $1$ ($z<0$, density $\\rho_1$): $\\hat{P}_{1,1}(z) = C_1 \\exp(kz)$.\nIn region $2$ ($z>0$, density $\\rho_2$): $\\hat{P}_{1,2}(z) = C_2 \\exp(-kz)$.\n\nNow we apply the linearized boundary conditions at the interface $z=0$.\n1.  Kinematic condition: The interface vertical velocity is the fluid vertical velocity.\n$v_{1z} = \\frac{d\\xi}{dt} = -i\\omega\\xi$. This must be continuous, so $v_{1z,1}(0) = v_{1z,2}(0) = -i\\omega\\xi_0$, where $\\xi = \\xi_0 \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} - i\\omega t)$.\n\n2.  Dynamic condition: The total pressure $p + \\frac{B^2}{8\\pi}$ is continuous across the perturbed interface $z=\\xi$.\n$p_2(\\xi) + \\frac{(\\mathbf{B}_0+\\mathbf{B}_{1,2}(\\xi))^2}{8\\pi} = p_1(\\xi) + \\frac{(\\mathbf{B}_0+\\mathbf{B}_{1,1}(\\xi))^2}{8\\pi}$.\nLinearizing this gives $[[p_0(\\xi) + p_1(\\xi) + \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_1(\\xi)}{4\\pi}]] = 0$, where $[[Q]] = Q_2 - Q_1$.\nUsing $p_0(\\xi) \\approx p_0(0) + \\xi \\frac{dp_0}{dz}|_0$ and $P_1 = p_1 + \\frac{\\mathbf{B}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_1}{4\\pi}$, this becomes:\n$[p_0(0)]] + \\xi \\left[\\left[\\frac{dp_0}{dz}\\right]\\right] + [[P_1(0)]] = 0$.\nThe equilibrium pressure $p_0$ is continuous at $z=0$, so $[[p_0(0)]] = 0$. With $\\frac{dp_0}{dz} = -\\rho_0 g$:\n$\\xi(-\\rho_2 g - (-\\rho_1 g)) + P_{1,2}(0) - P_{1,1}(0) = 0$\n$g\\xi(\\rho_1 - \\rho_2) + P_{1,2}(0) - P_{1,1}(0) = 0$.\n\nNext, we relate $P_1$ to $v_{1z}$ using the $z$-component of the momentum equation:\n$\\left[ \\omega^2 \\rho_0 - \\frac{(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{4\\pi} \\right] v_{1z} = -i\\omega \\frac{\\partial P_1}{\\partial z}$.\n\nFor region $1$ ($z<0$): $\\frac{\\partial \\hat{P}_{1,1}}{\\partial z} = k \\hat{P}_{1,1}$.\n$\\left[ \\omega^2 \\rho_1 - \\frac{(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{4\\pi} \\right] v_{1z,1} = -i\\omega k \\hat{P}_{1,1}$.\nAt $z=0$, $\\hat{P}_{1,1}(0) = -\\frac{1}{i\\omega k}\\left[ \\omega^2 \\rho_1 - \\frac{(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{4\\pi} \\right] v_{1z}(0)$.\n\nFor region $2$ ($z>0$): $\\frac{\\partial \\hat{P}_{1,2}}{\\partial z} = -k \\hat{P}_{1,2}$.\n$\\left[ \\omega^2 \\rho_2 - \\frac{(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{4\\pi} \\right] v_{1z,2} = -i\\omega (-k \\hat{P}_{1,2})$.\nAt $z=0$, $\\hat{P}_{1,2}(0) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega k}\\left[ \\omega^2 \\rho_2 - \\frac{(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{4\\pi} \\right] v_{1z}(0)$.\n\nSubstitute these into the pressure balance equation:\n$g\\xi(\\rho_1 - \\rho_2) + \\frac{v_{1z}(0)}{i\\omega k}\\left[ \\omega^2 \\rho_2 - \\frac{(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{4\\pi} \\right] - \\left(-\\frac{v_{1z}(0)}{i\\omega k}\\left[ \\omega^2 \\rho_1 - \\frac{(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{4\\pi} \\right]\\right) = 0$.\n$g\\xi(\\rho_1 - \\rho_2) + \\frac{v_{1z}(0)}{i\\omega k} \\left\\{ \\omega^2(\\rho_1+\\rho_2) - \\frac{2(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{4\\pi} \\right\\} = 0$.\nNow substitute $v_{1z}(0) = -i\\omega\\xi$:\n$g\\xi(\\rho_1 - \\rho_2) + \\frac{-i\\omega\\xi}{i\\omega k} \\left\\{ \\omega^2(\\rho_1+\\rho_2) - \\frac{(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{2\\pi} \\right\\} = 0$.\nDividing by $\\xi$ (for non-trivial perturbations) and rearranging:\n$g(\\rho_1 - \\rho_2) - \\frac{1}{k} \\left\\{ \\omega^2(\\rho_1+\\rho_2) - \\frac{(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{2\\pi} \\right\\} = 0$.\n$k g(\\rho_1 - \\rho_2) = \\omega^2(\\rho_1+\\rho_2) - \\frac{(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{2\\pi}$.\n\nThis gives the dispersion relation. Solving for $\\omega^2$:\n$\\omega^2 = \\frac{k g(\\rho_1 - \\rho_2)}{\\rho_1+\\rho_2} + \\frac{(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{2\\pi (\\rho_1+\\rho_2)}$.\n\nGiven $\\rho_2 > \\rho_1$, the first term is negative, driving instability. This is the Rayleigh-Taylor term.\nThe second term involves $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0 = |\\mathbf{k}||\\mathbf{B}_0|\\cos\\theta = k B_0\\cos\\theta$:\n$\\omega^2 = -kg\\frac{\\rho_2 - \\rho_1}{\\rho_1+\\rho_2} + \\frac{k^2 B_0^2 \\cos^2\\theta}{2\\pi (\\rho_1+\\rho_2)}$.\nThe magnetic term is proportional to $k^2$ and is always non-negative. It represents the stabilizing effect of magnetic tension, which resists the bending of field lines by the perturbation. This stabilizing contribution grows quadratically with the wavenumber $k$, meaning it is more effective at shorter wavelengths (larger $k$), as the problem statement requires us to show.\n\nThe interface is stable when $\\omega^2 \\geq 0$. The cutoff wavenumber $k_c$ is the value of $k$ where marginal stability ($\\omega^2 = 0$) is achieved.\n$0 = -k_c g\\frac{\\rho_2 - \\rho_1}{\\rho_1+\\rho_2} + \\frac{k_c^2 B_0^2 \\cos^2\\theta}{2\\pi (\\rho_1+\\rho_2)}$.\nAssuming $k_c \\neq 0$ and $\\cos\\theta \\neq 0$, we can divide by $k_c$ and rearrange:\n$k_c \\frac{B_0^2 \\cos^2\\theta}{2\\pi (\\rho_1+\\rho_2)} = g\\frac{\\rho_2 - \\rho_1}{\\rho_1+\\rho_2}$.\nSolving for $k_c$:\n$k_c = g(\\rho_2 - \\rho_1) \\frac{2\\pi}{B_0^2 \\cos^2\\theta}$.\nFor $k < k_c$, $\\omega^2 < 0$, and the interface is unstable. For $k > k_c$, $\\omega^2 > 0$, and the interface is stable. This expression represents the cutoff wavenumber above which magnetic tension stabilizes the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.\nThe final expression for $k_c$ is:\n$k_c = \\frac{2\\pi g (\\rho_2-\\rho_1)}{B_0^2 \\cos^2\\theta}$.",
