            "problem": "An electrically conducting astrophysical plasma is modeled within the framework of resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Consider a uniform, static plasma with constant scalar magnetic diffusivity $\\eta$ and no bulk flow, so that the fluid velocity satisfies $\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}$. The magnetic field is solenoidal, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}=0$. The governing magnetic induction equation is the resistive MHD induction equation, and you may use standard vector calculus identities, but do not assume any form of the solution a priori.\n\nAssume a one-dimensional spatial dependence along $x$ and restrict attention to a single transverse component $B_{y}(x,t)$ in a periodic domain of length $L$, with initial condition $B_{y}(x,0)=B_{0}\\cos(kx)$, where $k=2\\pi n/L$ with $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Starting from fundamental equations, derive the reduced evolution equation for $B_{y}(x,t)$ in this configuration and solve for $B_{y}(x,t)$, determining the exponential decay rate $\\gamma$ of the mode amplitude in terms of the magnetic diffusivity $\\eta$ and the wavenumber $k$.\n\nThen, introduce the Alfvén speed $v_{A}$ and the Alfvén frequency $\\omega_{A}=kv_{A}$, and define the Lundquist number on the mode scale $S_{k}\\equiv v_{A}/(\\eta k)$ and the magnetic Reynolds number on the same scale $R_{m,k}\\equiv V/(\\eta k)$ for an arbitrary characteristic flow speed $V$. Explain, from first principles, how the ratio of the resistive decay time to the Alfvén time depends on $S_{k}$, and how the ratio of the resistive decay time to the advective time depends on $R_{m,k}$. You should derive these relations; do not assume them.\n\nProvide your final answer as a single closed-form symbolic expression for the exponential decay rate $\\gamma$ in terms of $\\eta$ and $k$ only.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem from the field of resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). All necessary information is provided, and the requested derivations follow logically from fundamental principles.\n\nThe starting point is the resistive MHD induction equation, which governs the evolution of the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ in an electrically conducting fluid:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla \\times (\\eta \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe problem specifies a static plasma, so the fluid velocity $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$. This eliminates the first term on the right-hand side, which represents the advection of the magnetic field by the fluid flow. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\times (\\eta \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe magnetic diffusivity $\\eta$ is given as a constant scalar, so it can be moved outside the curl operator:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = - \\eta \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nWe now employ the standard vector calculus identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{A}$. Applying this to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = - \\eta \\left( \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is solenoidal, which is a fundamental constraint in MHD, expressed as $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. This condition causes the $\\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})$ term to vanish. The induction equation thus reduces to the magnetic diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis is a vector equation. The problem further restricts the analysis to a single transverse component $B_{y}$ that depends only on the spatial coordinate $x$ and time $t$. Thus, the magnetic field vector is $\\mathbf{B}(x,t) = B_{y}(x,t) \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. The left-hand side of the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial B_{y}(x,t)}{\\partial t} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\nThe Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ acting on $\\mathbf{B}$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\right) (B_{y}(x,t) \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})\n$$\nSince $B_{y}$ is a function of $x$ and $t$ only, its derivatives with respect to $y$ and $z$ are zero. The Laplacian simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{\\partial^2 B_{y}(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\nSubstituting these component forms back into the vector magnetic diffusion equation, we obtain the reduced evolution equation for the scalar component $B_{y}(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B_{y}}{\\partial t} = \\eta \\frac{\\partial^2 B_{y}}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis is the one-dimensional diffusion equation. We must solve this partial differential equation subject to the initial condition $B_{y}(x,0) = B_{0}\\cos(kx)$. Given the form of the initial condition, which is an eigenfunction of the spatial operator $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$, we can seek a solution using separation of variables, or more directly, by positing a solution of the form $B_{y}(x,t) = A(t) \\cos(kx)$. Substituting this ansatz into the PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} [A(t)\\cos(kx)] = \\eta \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} [A(t)\\cos(kx)]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} \\cos(kx) = \\eta A(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} [-k\\sin(kx)]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} \\cos(kx) = - \\eta k^2 A(t) \\cos(kx)\n$$\nFor this equation to hold for all $x$, we can divide by $\\cos(kx)$ (where it is non-zero), yielding an ordinary differential equation for the time-dependent amplitude $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = - \\eta k^2 A(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE whose solution is $A(t) = C \\exp(-\\eta k^2 t)$, where $C$ is the integration constant. We determine $C$ from the initial condition. At $t=0$, we have $B_{y}(x,0) = A(0) \\cos(kx)$. Comparing this with the given initial condition $B_{y}(x,0) = B_{0}\\cos(kx)$, we identify $A(0) = B_{0}$. Thus, $C=B_{0}$, and the amplitude evolves as $A(t) = B_{0}\\exp(-\\eta k^2 t)$.\nThe complete solution for the magnetic field component is:\n$$\nB_{y}(x,t) = B_{0} \\exp(-\\eta k^2 t) \\cos(kx)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the exponential decay rate $\\gamma$ of the mode amplitude. The amplitude of the mode is $B_{0} \\exp(-\\eta k^2 t)$. By inspection, this is of the form $B_{0} \\exp(-\\gamma t)$. Therefore, the decay rate is:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\eta k^2\n$$\nNext, we relate this to characteristic timescales and dimensionless numbers. The resistive decay time, $\\tau_{\\eta}$, is the e-folding time for the magnetic field amplitude, which is the reciprocal of the decay rate:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\eta} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} = \\frac{1}{\\eta k^2}\n$$\nThe Alfvén time on the mode scale, $\\tau_{A}$, is defined as the inverse of the Alfvén frequency $\\omega_{A} = k v_{A}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{A} = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{A}} = \\frac{1}{k v_{A}}\n$$\nThe ratio of the resistive decay time to the Alfvén time is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{\\eta}}{\\tau_{A}} = \\frac{1/(\\eta k^2)}{1/(k v_{A})} = \\frac{k v_{A}}{\\eta k^2} = \\frac{v_{A}}{\\eta k}\n$$\nThe problem defines the Lundquist number on the mode scale as $S_{k} \\equiv v_{A}/(\\eta k)$. Thus, we have derived the relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{\\eta}}{\\tau_{A}} = S_{k}\n$$\nThis shows that the Lundquist number represents the ratio of the magnetic diffusion time to the Alfvén crossing time.\n\nSimilarly, the advective time, $\\tau_{\\text{adv}}$, is the time for a flow with characteristic speed $V$ to cross the characteristic length of the mode, which is $1/k$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{adv}} = \\frac{1/k}{V} = \\frac{1}{k V}\n$$\nThe ratio of the resistive decay time to the advective time is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{\\eta}}{\\tau_{\\text{adv}}} = \\frac{1/(\\eta k^2)}{1/(k V)} = \\frac{k V}{\\eta k^2} = \\frac{V}{\\eta k}\n$$\nThe problem defines the magnetic Reynolds number on the mode scale as $R_{m,k} \\equiv V/(\\eta k)$. Thus, we have derived the relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{\\eta}}{\\tau_{\\text{adv}}} = R_{m,k}\n$$\nThis shows that the magnetic Reynolds number represents the ratio of the magnetic diffusion time to the fluid advection time.\nThe final answer requested is the expression for $\\gamma$ in terms of $\\eta$ and $k$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the effective scalar electrical conductivity, and the calculation of the magnetic diffusivity and magnetic Reynolds number for a partially ionized plasma. We will address each part in sequence.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the effective electrical conductivity $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$\nThe motion of the electron fluid is governed by the electron momentum equation. In a steady state ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$), and under the given assumptions of negligible electron inertia ($m_e \\frac{d\\vec{v}_e}{dt} \\approx \\vec{0}$) and negligible electron pressure gradient ($\\nabla p_e \\approx \\vec{0}$), the equation simplifies to a balance between the electromagnetic force and collisional drag forces:\n$$ \\vec{0} = -n_e e (\\vec{E} + \\vec{v}_e \\times \\vec{B}) - \\vec{R}_{ei} - \\vec{R}_{en} $$\nHere, $n_e$ is the electron number density, $-e$ is the electron charge, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $\\vec{v}_e$ is the electron fluid velocity, $\\vec{E}$ is the electric field, and $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field. The terms $\\vec{R}_{ei}$ and $\\vec{R}_{en}$ represent the momentum transfer per unit volume from electrons to ions and neutrals, respectively, due to collisions.\n\nThe collisional drag forces are proportional to the relative velocity between species:\n$$ \\vec{R}_{ei} = n_e m_e \\nu_{ei} (\\vec{v}_e - \\vec{v}_i) $$\n$$ \\vec{R}_{en} = n_e m_e \\nu_{en} (\\vec{v}_e - \\vec{v}_n) $$\nwhere $\\nu_{ei}$ and $\\nu_{en}$ are the respective momentum-transfer collision frequencies, and $\\vec{v}_i$ and $\\vec{v}_n$ are the bulk velocities of the ion and neutral fluids. The problem states that the heavy species share a common velocity, so we can set $\\vec{v}_i = \\vec{v}_n = \\vec{v}_h$. The total drag force on the electrons is then:\n$$ \\vec{R}_{ei} + \\vec{R}_{en} = n_e m_e (\\nu_{ei} + \\nu_{en})(\\vec{v}_e - \\vec{v}_h) $$\nSubstituting this into the momentum balance equation:\n$$ \\vec{0} = -n_e e (\\vec{E} + \\vec{v}_e \\times \\vec{B}) - n_e m_e (\\nu_{ei} + \\nu_{en})(\\vec{v}_e - \\vec{v}_h) $$\nWe are asked to find the scalar (or parallel) conductivity, which relates the current density and electric field components parallel to the magnetic field. We take the component of the momentum equation parallel to $\\vec{B}$ (denoted by the subscript $||$). The magnetic part of the Lorentz force, $(\\vec{v}_e \\times \\vec{B})_{||}$, is zero. Thus, the parallel momentum balance is:\n$$ 0 = -n_e e E_{||} - n_e m_e (\\nu_{ei} + \\nu_{en})(v_{e,||} - v_{h,||}) $$\nThe electric current density is given by $\\vec{j} = \\sum_s n_s q_s \\vec{v}_s$.

The advection term scales as the inflow of magnetic flux, $|\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})| \\sim \\frac{v_{in} B}{\\delta}$. The diffusion term scales with the dissipation of the current sheet, $|\\nabla \\times (\\eta \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})| \\sim \\eta \\frac{B}{\\delta^2}$. In a steady state, these two terms must balance:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{in} B}{\\delta} \\approx \\frac{\\eta B}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nThis gives a relationship for the inflow speed:\n$$\nv_{in} \\approx \\frac{\\eta}{\\delta}\n$$\n\nNext, we apply mass conservation for an incompressible fluid. The mass flux entering the rectangular reconnection region (of size $2L \\times 2\\delta$) must equal the mass flux exiting it.\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{in} = \\dot{m}_{out}\n$$\nThe mass inflow rate through the two long sides is $\\rho (2L) v_{in}$, and the mass outflow rate through the two short sides is $\\rho (2\\delta) v_{out}$. Equating these gives:\n$$\n\\rho (2L) v_{in} = \\rho (2\\delta) v_{out} \\implies L v_{in} = \\delta v_{out}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the outflow speed is the Alfvén speed, $v_{out} = v_{A}$. Thus:\n$$\nL v_{in} = \\delta v_{A}\n$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations for the two unknowns $v_{in}$ and $\\delta$:\n1. $v_{in} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\delta}$\n2. $L v_{in} = \\delta v_{A}$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$$\nL \\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\delta}\\right) = \\delta v_{A}\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta^2$:\n$$\n\\delta^2 = \\frac{L \\eta}{v_{A}}\n$$\nTo express this in terms of the Lundquist number $S = \\frac{v_{A} L}{\\eta}$, we rearrange the definition of $S$ to get $\\frac{\\eta}{v_{A}} = \\frac{L}{S}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\delta^2$:\n$$\n\\delta^2 = L \\left(\\frac{L}{S}\\right) = \\frac{L^2}{S}\n$$\nTaking the square root, we find the scaling for the current sheet half-thickness:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{S}} = L S^{-1/2}\n$$\n\nThe next step is to determine the constraint on the numerical grid. The problem requires that at least $N$ grid cells, each of spacing $\\Delta$, span the half-thickness $\\delta$. This condition is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\Delta} \\ge N\n$$\nThis implies an upper limit on the grid spacing required to resolve the layer:\n$$\n\\Delta \\le \\frac{\\delta}{N}\n$$\n\nThe total number of grid points $M$ along the global length $L$ is $M = L/\\Delta$. To find the *minimum* number of grid points, $M_{min}$, we must use the *largest* possible grid spacing, $\\Delta_{max} = \\delta/N$.\n$$\nM = M_{min} = \\frac{L}{\\Delta_{max}} = \\frac{L}{(\\delta/N)} = \\frac{LN}{\\delta}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\delta = L S^{-1/2}$:\n$$\nM = \\frac{LN}{L S^{-1/2}} = N S^{1/2} = N \\sqrt{S}\n$$\nThis is the minimum number of grid points required along the length $L$ to properly resolve the Sweet-Parker current sheet.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $M$ using the provided numerical values: $S = 10^6$ and $N = 10$.\n$$\nM = 10 \\times \\sqrt{10^6}\n$$\n$$\nM = 10 \\times (10^6)^{1/2} = 10 \\times 10^3\n$$\n$$\nM = 10000\n$$\nSince the derivation yields an exact form, the result is an integer.",
