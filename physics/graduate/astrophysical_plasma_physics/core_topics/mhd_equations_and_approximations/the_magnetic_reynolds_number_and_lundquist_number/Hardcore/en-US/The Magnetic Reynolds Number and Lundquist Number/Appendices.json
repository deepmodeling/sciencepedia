            "problem": "An electrically conducting astrophysical plasma is modeled within the framework of resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Consider a uniform, static plasma with constant scalar magnetic diffusivity $\\eta$ and no bulk flow, so that the fluid velocity satisfies $\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}$. The magnetic field is solenoidal, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}=0$. The governing magnetic induction equation is the resistive MHD induction equation, and you may use standard vector calculus identities, but do not assume any form of the solution a priori.\n\nAssume a one-dimensional spatial dependence along $x$ and restrict attention to a single transverse component $B_{y}(x,t)$ in a periodic domain of length $L$, with initial condition $B_{y}(x,0)=B_{0}\\cos(kx)$, where $k=2\\pi n/L$ with $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Starting from fundamental equations, derive the reduced evolution equation for $B_{y}(x,t)$ in this configuration and solve for $B_{y}(x,t)$, determining the exponential decay rate $\\gamma$ of the mode amplitude in terms of the magnetic diffusivity $\\eta$ and the wavenumber $k$.\n\nThen, introduce the Alfvén speed $v_{A}$ and the Alfvén frequency $\\omega_{A}=kv_{A}$, and define the Lundquist number on the mode scale $S_{k}\\equiv v_{A}/(\\eta k)$ and the magnetic Reynolds number on the same scale $R_{m,k}\\equiv V/(\\eta k)$ for an arbitrary characteristic flow speed $V$.

You should derive these relations; do not assume them.\n\nProvide your final answer as a single closed-form symbolic expression for the exponential decay rate $\\gamma$ in terms of $\\eta$ and $k$ only.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem from the field of resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). All necessary information is provided, and the requested derivations follow logically from fundamental principles.\n\nThe starting point is the resistive MHD induction equation, which governs the evolution of the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ in an electrically conducting fluid:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla \\times (\\eta \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe problem specifies a static plasma, so the fluid velocity $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$. This eliminates the first term on the right-hand side, which represents the advection of the magnetic field by the fluid flow. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\times (\\eta \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe magnetic diffusivity $\\eta$ is given as a constant scalar, so it can be moved outside the curl operator:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = - \\eta \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nWe now employ the standard vector calculus identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{A}$. Applying this to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = - \\eta \\left( \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is solenoidal, which is a fundamental constraint in MHD, expressed as $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. This condition causes the $\\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})$ term to vanish. The induction equation thus reduces to the magnetic diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis is a vector equation. The problem further restricts the analysis to a single transverse component $B_{y}$ that depends only on the spatial coordinate $x$ and time $t$. Thus, the magnetic field vector is $\\mathbf{B}(x,t) = B_{y}(x,t) \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. The left-hand side of the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial B_{y}(x,t)}{\\partial t} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\nThe Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ acting on $\\mathbf{B}$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\right) (B_{y}(x,t) \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})\n$$\nSince $B_{y}$ is a function of $x$ and $t$ only, its derivatives with respect to $y$ and $z$ are zero. The Laplacian simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{\\partial^2 B_{y}(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\nSubstituting these component forms back into the vector magnetic diffusion equation, we obtain the reduced evolution equation for the scalar component $B_{y}(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B_{y}}{\\partial t} = \\eta \\frac{\\partial^2 B_{y}}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis is the one-dimensional diffusion equation. We must solve this partial differential equation subject to the initial condition $B_{y}(x,0) = B_{0}\\cos(kx)$. Given the form of the initial condition, which is an eigenfunction of the spatial operator $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$, we can seek a solution using separation of variables, or more directly, by positing a solution of the form $B_{y}(x,t) = A(t) \\cos(kx)$. Substituting this ansatz into the PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} [A(t)\\cos(kx)] = \\eta \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} [A(t)\\cos(kx)]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} \\cos(kx) = \\eta A(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} [-k\\sin(kx)]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} \\cos(kx) = - \\eta k^2 A(t) \\cos(kx)\n$$\nFor this equation to hold for all $x$, we can divide by $\\cos(kx)$ (where it is non-zero), yielding an ordinary differential equation for the time-dependent amplitude $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = - \\eta k^2 A(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE whose solution is $A(t) = C \\exp(-\\eta k^2 t)$, where $C$ is the integration constant. We determine $C$ from the initial condition. At $t=0$, we have $B_{y}(x,0) = A(0) \\cos(kx)$. Comparing this with the given initial condition $B_{y}(x,0) = B_{0}\\cos(kx)$, we identify $A(0) = B_{0}$. Thus, $C=B_{0}$, and the amplitude evolves as $A(t) = B_{0}\\exp(-\\eta k^2 t)$.\nThe complete solution for the magnetic field component is:\n$$\nB_{y}(x,t) = B_{0} \\exp(-\\eta k^2 t) \\cos(kx)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the exponential decay rate $\\gamma$ of the mode amplitude. The amplitude of the mode is $B_{0} \\exp(-\\eta k^2 t)$. By inspection, this is of the form $B_{0} \\exp(-\\gamma t)$. Therefore, the decay rate is:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\eta k^2\n$$\nNext, we relate this to characteristic timescales and dimensionless numbers. The resistive decay time, $\\tau_{\\eta}$, is the e-folding time for the magnetic field amplitude, which is the reciprocal of the decay rate:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\eta} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} = \\frac{1}{\\eta k^2}\n$$\nThe Alfvén time on the mode scale, $\\tau_{A}$, is defined as the inverse of the Alfvén frequency $\\omega_{A} = k v_{A}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{A} = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{A}} = \\frac{1}{k v_{A}}\n$$\nThe ratio of the resistive decay time to the Alfvén time is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{\\eta}}{\\tau_{A}} = \\frac{1/(\\eta k^2)}{1/(k v_{A})} = \\frac{k v_{A}}{\\eta k^2} = \\frac{v_{A}}{\\eta k}\n$$\nThe problem defines the Lundquist number on the mode scale as $S_{k} \\equiv v_{A}/(\\eta k)$. Thus, we have derived the relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{\\eta}}{\\tau_{A}} = S_{k}\n$$\nThis shows that the Lundquist number represents the ratio of the magnetic diffusion time to the Alfvén crossing time.\n\nSimilarly, the advective time, $\\tau_{\\text{adv}}$, is the time for a flow with characteristic speed $V$ to cross the characteristic length of the mode, which is $1/k$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{adv}} = \\frac{1/k}{V} = \\frac{1}{k V}\n$$\nThe ratio of the resistive decay time to the advective time is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{\\eta}}{\\tau_{\\text{adv}}} = \\frac{1/(\\eta k^2)}{1/(k V)} = \\frac{k V}{\\eta k^2} = \\frac{V}{\\eta k}\n$$\nThe problem defines the magnetic Reynolds number on the mode scale as $R_{m,k} \\equiv V/(\\eta k)$. Thus, we have derived the relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{\\eta}}{\\tau_{\\text{adv}}} = R_{m,k}\n$$\nThis shows that the magnetic Reynolds number represents the ratio of the magnetic diffusion time to the fluid advection time.\nThe final answer requested is the expression for $\\gamma$ in terms of $\\eta$ and $k$.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, precise language.\n\nThe first step is to derive the magnetic induction equation. We start with the Maxwell-Faraday law of induction and a collisional form of Ohm's law appropriate for a resistive plasma.\n\nThe Maxwell-Faraday law is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = - \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field and $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field.\n\nThe collisional (or resistive) Ohm's law relates the electric field in the fluid frame to the current density $\\mathbf{J}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{\\mathbf{J}}{\\sigma}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity and $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity.\n\nIn non-relativistic MHD, we use Ampere's law without the displacement current term:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_{0} \\mathbf{J}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability. We can express the current density as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\mathbf{J}$ into Ohm's law gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\sigma} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nWe define the magnetic diffusivity, $\\eta$, as $\\eta = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\sigma}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\eta (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nSolving for $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = - \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} + \\eta (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\mathbf{E}$ into the Faraday law:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\left( - \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} + \\eta (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\right) = - \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nApplying the curl operator to both terms on the left:\n$$\n-\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) + \\nabla \\times (\\eta (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})) = - \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nThe problem states that conductivity $\\sigma$ is uniform, which implies that the magnetic diffusivity $\\eta$ is also uniform. Thus, $\\eta$ can be moved outside the curl operator:\n$$\n-\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) + \\eta \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = - \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nWe use the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$.

By comparing the magnitudes of the advection and diffusion terms using characteristic scales for velocity ($U$), length ($L$), and magnetic field ($B$), we get:\nMagnitude of advection term: $|\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})| \\sim \\frac{UB}{L}$\nMagnitude of diffusion term: $|\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}| \\sim \\frac{\\eta B}{L^2}$\n\nThe ratio of advective transport to resistive diffusion is the magnetic Reynolds number, $R_m$:\n$$\nR_m = \\frac{|\\text{advection}|}{|\\text{diffusion}|} = \\frac{UB/L}{\\eta B/L^2} = \\frac{UL}{\\eta}\n$$\nThe second ratio compares Alfvénic magnetic communication to resistive diffusion. The characteristic speed for magnetic communication is the Alfvén speed, $v_A = \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}}$. The Alfvén transit time across the characteristic length $L$ is $\\tau_A = L/v_A$. The resistive diffusion time is $\\tau_\\eta = L^2/\\eta$.

The given shear flow has a velocity $U = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and an Alfvén speed $v_A \\approx 2.68 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Since $U \\ll v_A$, the flow is strongly sub-Alfvénic. This means the magnetic field tension is strong enough to suppress the ideal Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, which would otherwise be driven by the velocity shear. Therefore, any instability in this layer must be fundamentally resistive in origin.\n\nThe primary resistive instability in a magnetized shear layer is the tearing mode, which leads to magnetic reconnection. The stability criteria and growth rates for tearing modes are principally determined by the Lundquist number, $S$. The Lundquist number compares the Alfvén timescale, which is the natural timescale for magnetic field dynamics, to the resistive diffusion timescale. A high Lundquist number (typically $S > 10^4$) indicates a strong tendency towards fast resistive instabilities. Given that $S \\approx 3.36 \\times 10^{17}$, the system is extremely prone to tearing. While the magnetic Reynolds number, $R_m$, indicates that the magnetic field is very well \"frozen-in\" to the bulk flow on the large scale $L$, it is the Lundquist number $S$ that governs the intrinsic stability of the magnetic configuration to resistive effects that can form fine structures and dissipate magnetic energy. Therefore, the Lundquist number is the more appropriate parameter controlling the onset of resistive phenomena in this magnetically dominated shear layer.",

The mass flux entering the rectangular reconnection region (of size $2L \\times 2\\delta$) must equal the mass flux exiting it.\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{in} = \\dot{m}_{out}\n$$\nThe mass inflow rate through the two long sides is $\\rho (2L) v_{in}$, and the mass outflow rate through the two short sides is $\\rho (2\\delta) v_{out}$. Equating these gives:\n$$\n\\rho (2L) v_{in} = \\rho (2\\delta) v_{out} \\implies L v_{in} = \\delta v_{out}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the outflow speed is the Alfvén speed, $v_{out} = v_{A}$. Thus:\n$$\nL v_{in} = \\delta v_{A}\n$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations for the two unknowns $v_{in}$ and $\\delta$:\n1. $v_{in} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\delta}$\n2. $L v_{in} = \\delta v_{A}$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$$\nL \\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\delta}\\right) = \\delta v_{A}\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta^2$:\n$$\n\\delta^2 = \\frac{L \\eta}{v_{A}}\n$$\nTo express this in terms of the Lundquist number $S = \\frac{v_{A} L}{\\eta}$, we rearrange the definition of $S$ to get $\\frac{\\eta}{v_{A}} = \\frac{L}{S}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\delta^2$:\n$$\n\\delta^2 = L \\left(\\frac{L}{S}\\right) = \\frac{L^2}{S}\n$$\nTaking the square root, we find the scaling for the current sheet half-thickness:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{S}} = L S^{-1/2}\n$$\n\nThe next step is to determine the constraint on the numerical grid. The problem requires that at least $N$ grid cells, each of spacing $\\Delta$, span the half-thickness $\\delta$. This condition is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\Delta} \\ge N\n$$\nThis implies an upper limit on the grid spacing required to resolve the layer:\n$$\n\\Delta \\le \\frac{\\delta}{N}\n$$\n\nThe total number of grid points $M$ along the global length $L$ is $M = L/\\Delta$. To find the *minimum* number of grid points, $M_{min}$, we must use the *largest* possible grid spacing, $\\Delta_{max} = \\delta/N$.\n$$\nM = M_{min} = \\frac{L}{\\Delta_{max}} = \\frac{L}{(\\delta/N)} = \\frac{LN}{\\delta}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\delta = L S^{-1/2}$:\n$$\nM = \\frac{LN}{L S^{-1/2}} = N S^{1/2} = N \\sqrt{S}\n$$\nThis is the minimum number of grid points required along the length $L$ to properly resolve the Sweet-Parker current sheet.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $M$ using the provided numerical values: $S = 10^6$ and $N = 10$.\n$$\nM = 10 \\times \\sqrt{10^6}\n$$\n$$\nM = 10 \\times (10^6)^{1/2} = 10 \\times 10^3\n$$\n$$\nM = 10000\n$$\nSince the derivation yields an exact form, the result is an integer.",
