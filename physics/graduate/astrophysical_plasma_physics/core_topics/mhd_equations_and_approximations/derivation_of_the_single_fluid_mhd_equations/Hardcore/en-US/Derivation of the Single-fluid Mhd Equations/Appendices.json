            "problem": "Consider a collisional, electrically conducting astrophysical plasma described in the single-fluid limit of Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).

            "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The derivation and analysis fall within standard Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) theory.\n\nFirst, we derive the induction equation from the given fundamental laws. We begin with the Maxwell–Faraday law of induction:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThe problem provides the resistive Ohm’s law for a moving conductor, which relates the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$, the current density $\\mathbf{J}$, the fluid velocity $\\mathbf{v}$, and the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{\\mathbf{J}}{\\sigma}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity. We can rearrange this to express the electric field as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{B} + \\frac{\\mathbf{J}}{\\sigma}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\mathbf{E}$ into the Faraday law yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla\\times \\left(-\\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{B} + \\frac{\\mathbf{J}}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the curl operator, we can separate the two terms on the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla\\times (\\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla\\times \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{J}}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\nSince the conductivity $\\sigma$ is assumed to be a uniform scalar, it can be taken outside the curl operator:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla\\times (\\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{J}\n$$\nNext, we eliminate the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ using Ampère’s law, which, neglecting the displacement current, is given as:\n$$\n\\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} = \\nabla\\times \\mathbf{B} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\nabla\\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability. Substituting this into our evolving equation for $\\partial \\mathbf{B}/\\partial t$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla\\times (\\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\sigma} \\nabla\\times (\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nWe recognize the term $1/(\\mu_0 \\sigma)$ as the magnetic diffusivity, $\\eta$, as defined in the problem statement. This gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla\\times (\\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\eta \\nabla\\times (\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nTo simplify the last term, we use the vector calculus identity $\\nabla\\times (\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{A}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{A}$. For the magnetic field, a fundamental constraint from Maxwell's equations is that it is solenoidal, i.e., $\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. Applying this, the identity simplifies to $\\nabla\\times (\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{B}) = -\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$. Substituting this result, we arrive at the induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla\\times (\\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{B}) + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThe first term on the right, $\\nabla\\times (\\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{B})$, represents the advection of the magnetic field by the fluid flow. The second term, $\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$, represents the diffusion of the magnetic field due to finite resistance.\n\nNext, we nondimensionalize this equation. We introduce the characteristic scales $L$ (length), $V$ (speed), and $B_0$ (magnetic field strength), and define the dimensionless variables:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{L}, \\quad \\tilde{t} = \\frac{t V}{L}, \\quad \\tilde{\\mathbf{v}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{V}, \\quad \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{B_0}\n$$\nFrom these definitions, we can write the dimensional variables and operators in terms of their dimensionless counterparts:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x} = L\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}, \\quad t = \\frac{L}{V}\\tilde{t}, \\quad \\mathbf{v} = V\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}, \\quad \\mathbf{B} = B_0\\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}\n$$\nWe must also transform the differential operators. Using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\nabla = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\tilde{\\nabla}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{t}}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\frac{V}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{t}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{V}{L} \\frac{\\partial (B_0 \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}})}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\tilde{\\nabla}\\right) \\times \\left(V\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}} \\times B_0\\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}\\right) + \\eta \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\tilde{\\nabla}\\right)^2 (B_0 \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}})\n$$\nWe can pull the constant factors out of the differentiation and vector operations:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{V B_0}{L}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\left(\\frac{V B_0}{L}\\right) \\tilde{\\nabla} \\times (\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}} \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}) + \\left(\\frac{\\eta B_0}{L^2}\\right) \\tilde{\\nabla}^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}\n$$\nTo make the equation dimensionless, we divide through by a characteristic scale, typically the coefficient of the advective term, which is $(V B_0 / L)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\tilde{\\nabla} \\times (\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}} \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}) + \\frac{\\eta B_0/L^2}{V B_0/L} \\tilde{\\nabla}^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}\n$$\nSimplifying the coefficient of the diffusive term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\eta B_0}{L^2} \\frac{L}{V B_0} = \\frac{\\eta}{VL}\n$$\nThe resulting dimensionless induction equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\tilde{\\nabla} \\times (\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}} \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}) + \\left(\\frac{\\eta}{VL}\\right) \\tilde{\\nabla}^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless group that quantifies the ratio of the magnitude of the advective term to the diffusive term. From the original dimensional induction equation, the magnitude of the advective term scales as $|\\nabla\\times (\\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{B})| \\sim (1/L) \\cdot V \\cdot B_0 = VB_0/L$. The magnitude of the diffusive term scales as $|\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}| \\sim \\eta \\cdot (1/L^2) \\cdot B_0 = \\eta B_0/L^2$. The ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\text{Advective Term}|}{|\\text{Diffusive Term}|} \\sim \\frac{VB_0/L}{\\eta B_0/L^2} = \\frac{VL}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis dimensionless group is the magnetic Reynolds number, $R_m$. The coefficient in our dimensionless equation, $\\eta/(VL)$, is $1/R_m$. Thus, the dimensionless group that quantifies the desired ratio is $\\frac{VL}{\\eta}$.\n\nFinally, we explain why the limit where this group, $R_m = VL/\\eta$, is asymptotically large corresponds to ideal behavior and magnetic flux freezing. When $R_m \\to \\infty$, its reciprocal $1/R_m \\to 0$. In this limit, the dimensionless induction equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\tilde{\\nabla} \\times (\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}} \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}})\n$$\nIn dimensional form, this is the ideal induction equation, which governs the evolution of the magnetic field in a perfectly conducting fluid (ideal MHD), where $\\eta = 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nTo demonstrate flux freezing, we consider the time rate of change of the magnetic flux $\\Phi_B = \\int_{S(t)} \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}$ through an arbitrary open surface $S(t)$ whose boundary moves with the fluid velocity $\\mathbf{v}$. According to the Reynolds transport theorem for a vector field through a moving surface, this rate of change is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt} = \\int_{S(t)} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} - \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\right) \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}\n$$\nIn the ideal MHD limit ($R_m \\to \\infty$), the integrand is precisely the ideal induction equation, which equals zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} - \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nTherefore, in this limit:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt} = \\int_{S(t)} \\mathbf{0} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = 0\n$$\nThis result, $d\\Phi_B/dt = 0$, signifies that the magnetic flux through any surface moving with the fluid is conserved. This is the principle of magnetic flux freezing, or Alfvén's theorem. It implies that the magnetic field lines are \"frozen into\" the conducting fluid and are transported along with its flow.\nThe dimensionless group that quantifies the ratio of advection to diffusion is $\\frac{VL}{\\eta}$.",

This means $\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{k} = 0$ (which we already used) and $\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0 = 0$.\nThe instruction to neglect pressure-gradient contributions along the polarization implies we project the momentum equation onto the direction of $\\mathbf{v}_1$, or recognize that for this polarization, $p_1=0$. To see this, rearrange Eq. M:\n$\\frac{i}{\\mu_0}(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0) \\mathbf{b} + i\\omega \\rho_0 \\mathbf{v}_1 = i\\mathbf{k} p_1$.\nFrom Eq. I, we see that $\\mathbf{b}$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{v}_1$. Therefore, the entire left-hand side is a vector parallel to $\\mathbf{v}_1$. The right-hand side is a vector parallel to $\\mathbf{k}$. Since $\\mathbf{v}_1 \\perp \\mathbf{k}$, the two sides can only be equal if they are both zero. For a non-trivial wave, we are interested in $\\mathbf{v}_1 \\neq 0$. Thus, we must have $i \\mathbf{k} p_1 = 0$, which for $k \\neq 0$ implies $p_1 = 0$.\n\nWith $p_1=0$, Eq. M simplifies to:\n$-\\omega \\rho_0 \\mathbf{v}_1 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0) \\mathbf{b}$ (after dividing by $i$).\n\nNow we substitute $\\mathbf{b}$ from Eq. I into this simplified momentum equation:\n$-\\omega \\rho_0 \\mathbf{v}_1 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0) \\left[ \\frac{i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)}{-i\\omega + \\eta k^2/\\mu_0} \\mathbf{v}_1 \\right]$.\nFor a non-trivial solution ($\\mathbf{v}_1 \\ne 0$), we can cancel $\\mathbf{v}_1$ to obtain the scalar dispersion relation:\n$-\\omega \\rho_0 = \\frac{i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{\\mu_0(-i\\omega + \\eta k^2/\\mu_0)}$.\n$-\\omega \\rho_0 \\mu_0 (-i\\omega + \\frac{\\eta k^2}{\\mu_0}) = i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2$.\n$i\\omega^2 \\rho_0 \\mu_0 - \\omega \\rho_0 \\eta k^2 = i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2$.\nDividing by $i \\rho_0 \\mu_0$:\n$\\omega^2 + i\\omega \\frac{\\eta k^2}{\\mu_0} - \\frac{(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{\\rho_0 \\mu_0} = 0$.\n\nThis is the dispersion relation for resistive shear Alfvén waves. To find the damping rate $\\gamma$, we seek a solution of the form $\\omega = \\omega_{\\mathrm{R}} - i\\gamma$, where $\\gamma > 0$ for damping and is assumed to be small compared to $\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}}$. Let us define the ideal Alfvén frequency squared, $\\omega_A^2 = \\frac{(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0)^2}{\\rho_0 \\mu_0}$. The dispersion relation is:\n$\\omega^2 + i\\omega \\frac{\\eta k^2}{\\mu_0} - \\omega_A^2 = 0$.\n\nWe substitute $\\omega = \\omega_{\\mathrm{R}} - i\\gamma$:\n$(\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}} - i\\gamma)^2 + i(\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}} - i\\gamma)\\frac{\\eta k^2}{\\mu_0} - \\omega_A^2 = 0$.\n$(\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}}^2 - \\gamma^2 - 2i\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}}\\gamma) + (i\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}}\\frac{\\eta k^2}{\\mu_0} + \\gamma\\frac{\\eta k^2}{\\mu_0}) - \\omega_A^2 = 0$.\nSeparating the real and imaginary parts:\nReal: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}}^2 - \\gamma^2 + \\gamma\\frac{\\eta k^2}{\\mu_0} - \\omega_A^2 = 0$.\nImaginary: $-2\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}}\\gamma + \\omega_{\\mathrm{R}}\\frac{\\eta k^2}{\\mu_0} = 0$.\n\nFrom the imaginary part, assuming an oscillatory solution exists ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}} \\ne 0$), we can divide by $\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}}$:\n$-2\\gamma + \\frac{\\eta k^2}{\\mu_0} = 0$.\nThis gives the damping rate:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{\\eta k^2}{2\\mu_0}$.\n\nThis result is derived without approximation, provided an oscillatory mode exists. The problem asks for the leading-order result in small $\\eta$. The \"smallness\" of $\\eta$ is the condition required for an oscillatory mode to exist, i.e., for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}}$ to be real. From the real part of the dispersion relation, we can find $\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}}^2 = \\omega_A^2 + \\gamma^2 - \\gamma\\frac{\\eta k^2}{\\mu_0}$. Substituting our expression for $\\gamma$: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}}^2 = \\omega_A^2 + (\\frac{\\eta k^2}{2\\mu_0})^2 - (\\frac{\\eta k^2}{2\\mu_0})\\frac{\\eta k^2}{\\mu_0} = \\omega_A^2 - \\frac{\\eta^2 k^4}{4\\mu_0^2}$. For $\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}}$ to be real, we need $\\omega_A^2 > \\frac{\\eta^2 k^4}{4\\mu_0^2}$, which holds for sufficiently small $\\eta$.\n\nIn the leading-order approximation (small $\\eta$), $\\omega_{\\mathrm{R}} \\approx \\omega_A$, and the derived value for $\\gamma$ is the leading-order damping rate. It depends on $\\eta$, the vacuum permeability $\\mu_0$, and the magnitude of the wavevector $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$, as requested.",
