The equations provided (mass continuity, ideal Ohm's Law, Faraday's Law) are fundamental to this field. The setup describes a simple, idealized compression, which is a common scenario for studying basic plasma dynamics. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a complete set of initial conditions ($\\rho(t=0)$, $\\mathbf{B}(t=0)$), a well-defined velocity field, and the governing equations.

All necessary information is provided.\n5.  **Consistency**: There are no apparent contradictions in the provided data or equations. The initial conditions and the flow geometry are consistent with a one-dimensional problem simplification.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a standard, well-posed problem in ideal MHD that tests the understanding of fundamental principles like mass conservation and frozen-in flux. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the time evolution of density and magnetic field for a fluid element. This suggests a Lagrangian perspective, where we follow the properties of the fluid as it moves. The governing equations can be expressed in a Lagrangian frame, where $\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla$ is the material or convective derivative, representing the rate of change for a fluid element.\n\nFirst, we derive the time dependence of the mass density, $\\rho(t)$. The mass continuity equation in the Eulerian frame is $\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho\\mathbf{v}) = 0$. This can be rewritten using the product rule as $\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla\\rho + \\rho(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) = 0$. The first two terms constitute the material derivative of $\\rho$. Therefore, the Lagrangian form of the continuity equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\rho}{dt} + \\rho(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) = 0\n$$\nThe velocity field is given as $\\mathbf{v} = (-\\alpha x, 0, 0)$. We calculate its divergence:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial(-\\alpha x)}{\\partial x} + 0 + 0 = -\\alpha\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Lagrangian continuity equation gives a simple ordinary differential equation for the density of a fluid element:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\rho}{dt} + \\rho(-\\alpha) = 0 \\implies \\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = \\alpha\\rho\n$$\nThis equation can be solved by separation of variables: $\\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho} = \\alpha dt$. Integrating both sides yields $\\ln(\\rho) = \\alpha t + C$, where C is the integration constant. Exponentiating gives $\\rho(t) = \\exp(C)\\exp(\\alpha t)$. At $t=0$, the density is $\\rho(0) = \\rho_{0}$. This sets the constant, $\\exp(C) = \\rho_{0}$. Thus, the density evolution is:\n$$\n\\rho(t) = \\rho_0 \\exp(\\alpha t)\n$$\nSince the initial density $\\rho_0$ was uniform, the density remains spatially uniform for all time $t0$, increasing exponentially due to the compression.\n\nNext, we derive the time dependence of the magnetic field, $\\mathbf{B}(t)$. The evolution of the magnetic field in ideal MHD is governed by the induction equation. Combining Faraday's Law, $\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}$, and the ideal Ohm's Law, $\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}$, we get the Eulerian induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe corresponding Lagrangian equation, which describes the change in $\\mathbf{B}$ for a fluid element, is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{B}}{dt} = (\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{B}(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v})\n$$\nThe initial magnetic field is $\\mathbf{B}(0) = B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. The field is purely in the $y$-direction and is transverse to the flow velocity, which is in the $x$-direction. Let's analyze the term $(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v}$:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v} = \\left(B_x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + B_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + B_z \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)(v_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}})\n$$\nInitially, $B_x=0$ and $B_z=0$. Let's assume the field remains in the $y$-direction, $\\mathbf{B}(t) = B_y(t) \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. Then:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v} = B_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (-\\alpha x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) = 0\n$$\nThe term is zero because $v_x$ does not depend on $y$. The Lagrangian induction equation for $\\mathbf{B} = B_y \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ then simplifies significantly:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{B}}{dt} = 0 - \\mathbf{B}(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) = -\\mathbf{B}(-\\alpha) = \\alpha\\mathbf{B}\n$$\nWriting this for the $y$-component:\n$$\n\\frac{dB_y}{dt} = \\alpha B_y\n$$\nThis is the same form of differential equation as for the density. With the initial condition $B_y(0) = B_0$, the solution is:\n$$\nB_y(t) = B_0 \\exp(\\alpha t)\n$$\nThe components $B_x$ and $B_z$ are initially zero, and their evolution equations are $\\frac{dB_x}{dt}=0$ and $\\frac{dB_z}{dt}=0$, so they remain zero for all time. Our assumption that $\\mathbf{B}$ remains in the $y$-direction is therefore self-consistent.\n\nFinally, we are asked to verify the behavior of the ratio $B_y(t)/\\rho(t)$ against the prediction of Alfvén’s theorem. Alfvén’s theorem states that magnetic field lines are \"frozen into\" the fluid in ideal MHD. A consequence is that for a compression or expansion, the component of the magnetic field transverse to the motion scales proportionally with the mass density, i.e., $B_{\\perp} \\propto \\rho$. In this problem, the motion is in the $x$-direction, and the magnetic field $B_y$ is transverse. Therefore, we expect $B_y/\\rho$ to be constant.\n\nLet's calculate this ratio using our derived expressions:\n$$\n\\frac{B_y(t)}{\\rho(t)} = \\frac{B_0 \\exp(\\alpha t)}{\\rho_0 \\exp(\\alpha t)} = \\frac{B_0}{\\rho_0}\n$$\nThe ratio is indeed a constant, determined by the initial conditions. This result quantitatively verifies the prediction derived from Alfvén's theorem for a field component transverse to the compression. The compression increases the density, and the frozen-in field lines are brought closer together, strengthening the transverse field in exact proportion to the density increase.\n\nThe final expressions are:\n1.  $B_y(t) = B_0 \\exp(\\alpha t)$\n2.  $\\rho(t) = \\rho_0 \\exp(\\alpha t)$\n3.  $\\frac{B_y(t)}{\\rho(t)} = \\frac{B_0}{\\rho_0}$",

With $\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp}$, $\\mathbf{B}=\\mathbf{B}$, $\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B} = (\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\mathbf{B})\\mathbf{B} - (\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{B})\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp}\n$$\nBy definition, $\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp}$ is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$, so their dot product is zero: $\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. The dot product $\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$ is the squared magnitude of the magnetic field, $B^2$.\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B} = -B^2 \\mathbf{w}_{\\perp}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation yields:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B} - B^2 \\mathbf{w}_{\\perp} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nSolving for $\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp}$ gives the general expression for the perpendicular field-line advection velocity, valid wherever $B \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp} = \\frac{\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\n$$\nThis is the well-known $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ drift velocity.\n\nNext, we evaluate this velocity for the specific fields given: $\\mathbf{E} = E_{0}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ and $\\mathbf{B}(x,y) = (ax + cy)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (-ay - cx)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\nFirst, we compute the cross product $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B} = (E_{0}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) \\times [(ax + cy)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (-ay - cx)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}] = E_{0}(ax + cy)(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) + E_{0}(-ay - cx)(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})\n$$\nUsing the cyclic relations for the Cartesian unit vectors, $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = -\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B} = E_{0}(ax + cy)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} - E_{0}(-ay - cx)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = E_{0}(ay + cx)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + E_{0}(ax + cy)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\nNext, we compute the squared magnitude of the magnetic field, $B^2 = |\\mathbf{B}|^2$:\n$$\nB^2 = (ax+cy)^2 + (-ay-cx)^2 = (a^2x^2 + 2acxy + c^2y^2) + (a^2y^2 + 2acxy + c^2x^2)\n$$\n$$\nB^2 = (a^2+c^2)x^2 + (a^2+c^2)y^2 + 4acxy = (a^2+c^2)(x^2+y^2) + 4acxy\n$$\nNow we can write the expression for $\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp}(x,y)$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp}(x,y) = E_{0} \\frac{(ay + cx)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (ax + cy)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}}{(a^2+c^2)(x^2+y^2) + 4acxy}\n$$\nTo examine the limit as $(x,y) \\to (0,0)$, we switch to polar coordinates, $x = r\\cos\\theta$ and $y = r\\sin\\theta$. Substituting these into the numerator and denominator:\nNumerator: $E_{0}[(ar\\sin\\theta + cr\\cos\\theta)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (ar\\cos\\theta + cr\\sin\\theta)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}] = E_{0}r[(a\\sin\\theta + c\\cos\\theta)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (a\\cos\\theta + c\\sin\\theta)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}]$\nDenominator: $(a^2+c^2)r^2 + 4acr^2\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta = r^2[(a^2+c^2) + 2ac\\sin(2\\theta)]$\nThe velocity is then:\n$$\n\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp}(r,\\theta) = \\frac{E_{0}}{r} \\frac{(a\\sin\\theta + c\\cos\\theta)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (a\\cos\\theta + c\\sin\\theta)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}}{(a^2+c^2) + 2ac\\sin(2\\theta)}\n$$\nAs $r \\to 0$, the magnitude of the velocity, $|\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp}|$, scales as $1/r$ and thus diverges to infinity, provided the denominator is non-zero. The expression also explicitly depends on the angle of approach $\\theta$. This means the limit of $\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp}$ as $(x,y) \\to (0,0)$ is both singular (it diverges) and path-dependent (its direction depends on $\\theta$).\n\nThe physical implication of this result is profound. The concept of magnetic field lines being \"frozen-in\" to the plasma, which is the cornerstone of Alfvén's theorem, relies on the existence of a unique, finite velocity field for the field lines. The singularity of $\\mathbf{w}_{\\perp}$ at the magnetic null ($B=0$) demonstrates a catastrophic failure of this ideal MHD description. It is physically impossible for the plasma to move at infinite speed. This breakdown of ideal MHD is precisely what allows for magnetic reconnection to occur. A non-ideal term, in this case resistivity $\\eta$, must become important in a small region around the null point to resolve the singularity, break the frozen-in condition, and allow for the change in magnetic topology characteristic of reconnection.\n\nNow we proceed to the second task: to determine the reconnection electric field $E_{z}$ at the null. We use the equations valid in the diffusion region. First, we calculate the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ using Ampère's law without the displacement current, $\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}$. We are interested in the out-of-plane component, $J_z$, at the null point.\n$$\nJ_z = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}} (\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B})_z = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\nWith $B_x = ax + cy$ and $B_y = -ay - cx$, the partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-ay - cx) = -c\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(ax + cy) = c\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $J_z$:\n$$\nJ_z = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}}(-c - c) = -\\frac{2c}{\\mu_{0}}\n$$\nThis result is a constant, independent of position $(x,y)$, so it is also the value of the current density at the null point $(0,0)$.\n\nFinally, we use the resistive Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\eta\\mathbf{J}$, to find the electric field at the null. At the null point $(x,y)=(0,0)$, the magnetic field is zero, $\\mathbf{B}(0,0) = \\mathbf{0}$. The $\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}$ term vanishes, and the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}(0,0) = \\eta\\mathbf{J}(0,0)\n$$\nThe problem states that the electric field is uniform and out-of-plane, $\\mathbf{E} = E_{0}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The reconnection electric field $E_z$ is the component of $\\mathbf{E}$ at the null, so $E_z = E_0$. The current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is also purely in the $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ direction, since the magnetic field is purely in the $x-y$ plane and has no $z$-dependence. Thus, $\\mathbf{J}(0,0) = J_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = -\\frac{2c}{\\mu_{0}}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\nSubstituting these into the simplified Ohm's law gives:\n$$\nE_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\eta \\left(-\\frac{2c}{\\mu_{0}}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nBy comparing the components, we obtain the expression for the reconnection electric field at the null:\n$$\nE_z = -\\frac{2c\\eta}{\\mu_{0}}\n$$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{2c\\eta}{\\mu_{0}}}$$"
