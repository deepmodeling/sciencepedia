            "problem": "A one-dimensional Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) capacitor is formed by a semi-infinite semiconductor occupying $x<0$, a uniform oxide of thickness $t_{ox}$ and permittivity $\\varepsilon_{ox}$ occupying $0<x<t_{ox}$, and a metal gate at $x=t_{ox}$. Consider the flatband condition defined as the gate voltage at which the semiconductor surface potential is zero and the electric field in the semiconductor is zero. Let the ideal flatband voltage be $V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}}=\\phi_{ms}$, where $\\phi_{ms}$ is the metal–semiconductor work function difference. \n\nNon-ideal charges are present as follows:\n- A constant net interface trap charge per unit area $Q_{it}$ located at the oxide/semiconductor interface at $x=0$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the flatband voltage shift, $\\Delta V_{FB}$, in a non-ideal Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) capacitor due to interface trap charges and fixed oxide charges. The derivation must be based on fundamental electrostatic principles.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the applied gate voltage, $V_G$, the work function difference, $\\phi_{ms}$, the voltage drop across the oxide, $V_{ox}$, and the semiconductor surface potential, $\\psi_s$. The overall energy balance for the MOS system requires that the applied gate voltage accounts for these potential differences:\n$$ V_G = \\phi_{ms} + V_{ox} + \\psi_s $$\nThe flatband voltage, $V_{FB}$, is defined as the gate voltage $V_G$ at which the semiconductor is at flatband. The flatband condition is characterized by a zero surface potential, $\\psi_s = 0$, and consequently, a zero electric field everywhere within the semiconductor, $\\mathcal{E}_{semi}(x) = 0$ for $x<0$.\nSubstituting $\\psi_s=0$ into the voltage balance equation at flatband gives:\n$$ V_{FB} = \\phi_{ms} + V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}} $$\nwhere $V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}}$ is the voltage drop across the oxide under flatband conditions.\n\nThe ideal flatband voltage is given as $V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} = \\phi_{ms}$, which corresponds to a device with no oxide or interface charges. In this ideal case, $V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}}$ would be zero.\nThe flatband voltage shift, $\\Delta V_{FB}$, is the difference between the actual and ideal flatband voltages:\n$$ \\Delta V_{FB} = V_{FB} - V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} = (\\phi_{ms} + V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}}) - \\phi_{ms} = V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}} $$\nTherefore, the problem reduces to calculating the voltage drop across the oxide, $V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}}$, under the specified flatband conditions.\n\nThe voltage drop across the oxide is defined as the potential difference between the gate electrode at $x=t_{ox}$ and the semiconductor interface at $x=0$. It can be found by integrating the electric field in the oxide, $\\mathcal{E}_{ox}(x)$, from $x=0$ to $x=t_{ox}$:\n$$ V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}} = V(t_{ox}) - V(0) = -\\int_{0}^{t_{ox}} \\mathcal{E}_{ox}(x) \\, dx $$\nTo find $\\mathcal{E}_{ox}(x)$, we apply Gauss's law in one dimension. The electric displacement field, $D(x)$, changes only at locations with net charge. In this problem, we have a sheet of interface trap charge $Q_{it}$ at $x=0$ and a sheet of fixed oxide charge $Q_f$ at $x=x_f$.\n\nLet's determine the displacement field $D_{ox}(x)$ within the oxide ($0 < x < t_{ox}$). At the oxide-semiconductor interface ($x=0$), the boundary condition from Gauss's law is:\n$$ D_{ox}(0^+) - D_{semi}(0^-) = Q_{it} $$\nUnder flatband conditions, the electric field in the semiconductor is zero, $\\mathcal{E}_{semi}(x)=0$. Therefore, the displacement field in the semiconductor is also zero, $D_{semi}(x) = \\varepsilon_{semi}\\mathcal{E}_{semi}(x) = 0$. This implies $D_{semi}(0^-) = 0$. The boundary condition simplifies to:\n$$ D_{ox}(0^+) = Q_{it} $$\nIn the region of the oxide between the interface and the fixed charge sheet ($0 < x < x_f$), there is no bulk charge. Thus, the displacement field $D_{ox}(x)$ is constant and equal to its value at $x=0^+$:\n$$ D_{ox}(x) = Q_{it} \\quad \\text{for } 0 < x < x_f $$\nThe corresponding electric field in this region is:\n$$ \\mathcal{E}_{ox}(x) = \\frac{D_{ox}(x)}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} = \\frac{Q_{it}}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} \\quad \\text{for } 0 < x < x_f $$\nNext, we apply Gauss's law at the location of the fixed charge sheet, $x=x_f$:\n$$ D_{ox}(x_f^+) - D_{ox}(x_f^-) = Q_f $$\nWe know $D_{ox}(x_f^-) = Q_{it}$. Therefore, the displacement field for the region $x_f < x < t_{ox}$ is:\n$$ D_{ox}(x_f^+) = D_{ox}(x_f^-) + Q_f = Q_{it} + Q_f $$\nAs there is no further charge within the oxide for $x>x_f$, the displacement field is constant in this second region:\n$$ D_{ox}(x) = Q_{it} + Q_f \\quad \\text{for } x_f < x < t_{ox} $$\nThe corresponding electric field in this region is:\n$$ \\mathcal{E}_{ox}(x) = \\frac{D_{ox}(x)}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} = \\frac{Q_{it} + Q_f}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} \\quad \\text{for } x_f < x < t_{ox} $$\nNow we can compute the integral for $V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}}$ by splitting it into two parts corresponding to the two regions of the oxide:\n$$ V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}} = -\\int_{0}^{t_{ox}} \\mathcal{E}_{ox}(x) \\, dx = - \\left[ \\int_{0}^{x_f} \\frac{Q_{it}}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} \\, dx + \\int_{x_f}^{t_{ox}} \\frac{Q_{it} + Q_f}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} \\, dx \\right] $$\nSince the electric fields are constant in each region, the integration is straightforward:\n$$ V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}} = - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} \\left[ Q_{it} \\int_{0}^{x_f} dx + (Q_{it} + Q_f) \\int_{x_f}^{t_{ox}} dx \\right] $$\n$$ V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}} = - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} \\left[ Q_{it} (x_f - 0) + (Q_{it} + Q_f) (t_{ox} - x_f) \\right] $$\nExpanding the terms inside the brackets:\n$$ V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}} = - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} \\left[ Q_{it} x_f + Q_{it} t_{ox} - Q_{it} x_f + Q_f t_{ox} - Q_f x_f \\right] $$\nThe $Q_{it} x_f$ terms cancel, leaving:\n$$ V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}} = - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} \\left[ Q_{it} t_{ox} + Q_f (t_{ox} - x_f) \\right] $$\nAs established earlier, $\\Delta V_{FB} = V_{ox,\\mathrm{FB}}$.

Let's calculate $\\mu(T_{x})$:\n$$\n\\mu(T_{x}) = (600\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}/(V \\cdot s)}) \\left(\\frac{193.8\\,\\mathrm{K}}{300\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)^{-0.5} \\approx 600 \\times (0.646)^{-0.5} \\approx 600 \\times 1.245 \\approx 747.0\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}/(V \\cdot s)}\n$$\nFor consistency in units, we convert $\\mu(T_{x})$ and $n_s$ to SI units:\n$$\n\\mu(T_{x}) \\approx 747.0\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}/(V \\cdot s)} \\times \\left(\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{m}}{100\\,\\mathrm{cm}}\\right)^{2} = 7.470 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/(V \\cdot s)}\n$$\n$$\nn_{s} = 5.0 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\times \\left(\\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{1\\,\\mathrm{m}}\\right)^{2} = 5.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$\nNow we compute $R_{\\mathrm{sheet}}(T_{x})$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{sheet}}(T_{x}) = \\frac{1}{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})(5.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2})(7.470 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/(V \\cdot s)})}\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{sheet}}(T_{x}) \\approx \\frac{1}{5.983 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{A/V}} \\approx 1671\\,\\Omega\n$$\nNow we can compute $\\tau_{\\mathrm{inv}}(T_{x})$ using $L = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{inv}}(T_{x}) = R_{\\mathrm{sheet}}(T_x) C_{\\mathrm{ox}} L^2 \\approx (1671\\,\\Omega) (6.906 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{inv}}(T_{x}) \\approx (1671) (6.906 \\times 10^{-3}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-10})\\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 1.154 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the product $\\omega \\tau_{\\mathrm{inv}}(T_{x})$:\n$$\n\\omega \\tau_{\\mathrm{inv}}(T_{x}) = (2\\pi \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (1.154 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\approx 7.25 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nThe value $7.25 \\times 10^{-3}$ is $0.00725$, which is indeed much less than $1$. The condition $\\omega \\tau_{\\mathrm{inv}}(T_{x}) \\ll 1$ is satisfied, confirming that the inversion layer response is much faster than the measurement signal period at the trap freeze-out temperature. This justifies the initial assumption that the inversion layer can still follow the modulation.\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the value of $T_{x}$.\n$$\nT_{x} \\approx 193.8\\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$",
