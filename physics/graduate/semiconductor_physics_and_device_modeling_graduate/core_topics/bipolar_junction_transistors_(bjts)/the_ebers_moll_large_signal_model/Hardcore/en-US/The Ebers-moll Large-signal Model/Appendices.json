The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded, with all necessary parameters provided for a solution based on first-principles carrier transport.\n\nWe begin by calculating the necessary physical quantities from the given parameters. The temperature is $T=300~\\mathrm{K}$. The thermal voltage is $V_T = k_B T/q$, but it is not directly needed as the Ebers-Moll parameters are defined independently of the operating voltages.\n\nFirst, we calculate the minority carrier diffusion lengths in the emitter, base, and collector regions.

The circuit configuration is canonical. The request for a first-order perturbation analysis is a standard and valid engineering and physics technique. No pseudoscience or factual unsoundness is present.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete set of symbolic parameters and a clear circuit description. The objective is to derive an analytical expression for the first-order shifts in operating point quantities due to specific non-ideal effects.

The statement about \"small parameters $\\alpha_R$ and $I_{CS}$\" could be interpreted as awkward, given the reciprocity relation $\\alpha_F I_{ES} = \\alpha_R I_{CS}$, but the context of a first-order expansion and the specific request for the component proportional to $\\alpha_R$ make the intent clear: to isolate a specific term's contribution through superposition in a linearized model. This does not render the problem invalid.\n  - No unrealistic or infeasible conditions are required.\n  - The problem is well-structured and leads to a unique solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid** as it represents a standard, well-posed problem in electronics and device modeling. A full derivation will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe Ebers–Moll equations for the collector and emitter currents, $I_C$ and $I_E$, are given by:\n$$I_C = \\alpha_F I_{ES}(\\exp(V_{BE}/V_T) - 1) - I_{CS}(\\exp(V_{BC}/V_T) - 1)$$\n$$I_E = I_{ES}(\\exp(V_{BE}/V_T) - 1) - \\alpha_R I_{CS}(\\exp(V_{BC}/V_T) - 1)$$\nThe base current is $I_B = I_E - I_C$:\n$$I_B = (1-\\alpha_F)I_{ES}(\\exp(V_{BE}/V_T) - 1) + (1-\\alpha_R)I_{CS}(\\exp(V_{BC}/V_T) - 1)$$\nThe problem defines an ideal reference operating point $\\{I_{C0}, V_{CE0}\\}$ where $\\alpha_R=0$ and the collector-base diode conduction is neglected. This implies setting the term $I_{CS}(\\exp(V_{BC}/V_T)-1)$ to zero. The reference model is thus:\n$$I_{C0} = \\alpha_F I_{ES}(\\exp(V_{BE0}/V_T) - 1)$$\n$$I_{B0} = (1-\\alpha_F)I_{ES}(\\exp(V_{BE0}/V_T) - 1) = \\frac{I_{C0}}{\\beta_F}$$\nThe external circuit equations at this reference point are:\n$$V_{BB} = I_{B0} R_B + V_{BE0}$$\n$$V_{CE0} = V_{CC} - I_{C0} R_C$$\n\nNow we introduce the non-ideal effects. The full Ebers–Moll equations are reconsidered. We perform a first-order perturbation analysis around the reference point. Let $I_C = I_{C0} + \\Delta I_C$, $I_B = I_{B0} + \\Delta I_B$, $V_{BE} = V_{BE0} + \\Delta V_{BE}$, and $V_{CE} = V_{CE0} + \\Delta V_{CE}$. The base-collector voltage is $V_{BC} = V_{BE} - V_{CE} = (V_{BE0} - V_{CE0}) + (\\Delta V_{BE} - \\Delta V_{CE}) = V_{BC0} + \\Delta V_{BC}$.\n\nThe problem states that for the reference point, $|V_{BC0}| \\gg V_T$. Since the BJT is in forward-active mode, $V_{BC0}$ is negative, so $V_{BC0} \\ll -V_T$. This allows the approximation $\\exp(V_{BC0}/V_T) \\approx 0$. To first order, we approximate $\\exp(V_{BC}/V_T) \\approx \\exp(V_{BC0}/V_T) \\approx 0$. Thus, the term $(\\exp(V_{BC}/V_T) - 1) \\approx -1$.\n\nThe expressions for $I_C$ and $I_B$ become:\n$$I_C \\approx \\alpha_F I_{ES}(\\exp(V_{BE}/V_T) - 1) + I_{CS}$$\n$$I_B \\approx (1-\\alpha_F)I_{ES}(\\exp(V_{BE}/V_T) - 1) - (1-\\alpha_R)I_{CS}$$\n\nWe linearize these equations around the operating point.\nFor the collector current:\n$I_{C0} + \\Delta I_C \\approx \\alpha_F I_{ES}(\\exp(V_{BE0}/V_T)\\exp(\\Delta V_{BE}/V_T) - 1) + I_{CS}$\nUsing $\\exp(x) \\approx 1+x$ for small $x$, and assuming forward active bias where $\\exp(V_{BE0}/V_T) \\gg 1$:\n$I_{C0} + \\Delta I_C \\approx \\alpha_F I_{ES}\\exp(V_{BE0}/V_T)(1 + \\Delta V_{BE}/V_T) + I_{CS}$\nSince $I_{C0} \\approx \\alpha_F I_{ES}\\exp(V_{BE0}/V_T)$, this simplifies to:\n$I_{C0} + \\Delta I_C \\approx I_{C0}(1 + \\Delta V_{BE}/V_T) + I_{CS}$\nThe first-order shift in collector current is:\n$$\\Delta I_C \\approx \\frac{I_{C0}}{V_T} \\Delta V_{BE} + I_{CS}$$\nThis can be interpreted as a change due to the transconductance $g_m = I_{C0}/V_T$ acting on $\\Delta V_{BE}$, plus a perturbation source term $I_{CS}$.\n\nFor the base current:\n$I_{B0} + \\Delta I_B \\approx (1-\\alpha_F)I_{ES}\\exp(V_{BE0}/V_T)(1 + \\Delta V_{BE}/V_T) - (1-\\alpha_R)I_{CS}$\nSince $I_{B0} \\approx (1-\\alpha_F)I_{ES}\\exp(V_{BE0}/V_T)$:\n$I_{B0} + \\Delta I_B \\approx I_{B0}(1 + \\Delta V_{BE}/V_T) - (1-\\alpha_R)I_{CS}$\nThe first-order shift in base current is:\n$$\\Delta I_B \\approx \\frac{I_{B0}}{V_T} \\Delta V_{BE} - (1-\\alpha_R)I_{CS} = \\frac{I_{C0}}{\\beta_F V_T} \\Delta V_{BE} - I_{CS} + \\alpha_R I_{CS}$$\nThis shows two perturbation source terms affecting the base current: $-I_{CS}$ and $+\\alpha_R I_{CS}$.\n\nThe external circuit imposes constraints on the shifts. From the base loop, $V_{BB} = I_B R_B + V_{BE}$. Since $V_{BB}$ is constant, the shift equation is $0 = \\Delta I_B R_B + \\Delta V_{BE}$, or:\n$$\\Delta V_{BE} = -\\Delta I_B R_B$$\n\nThe problem asks for the shifts caused by $\\alpha_R$ alone. By the principle of superposition for this linearized system, we can find the effect of the perturbation source term proportional to $\\alpha_R$, which is $\\delta I_{B, \\text{source}}^{(\\alpha_R)} = \\alpha_R I_{CS}$. We set all other perturbation sources to zero.

            "problem": "You are to write a complete, runnable program that uses the Ebers–Moll large-signal model of a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) to generate synthetic current–voltage data, extract model parameters from that data, and quantify the sensitivity of the extracted saturation current to a small error in the thermal voltage. The derivation and algorithm must proceed from fundamental principles and well-tested facts, not by quoting the target model formulas. Start from the pn-junction current–voltage relation and the definition of thermal voltage, under the usual ideal-transistor assumptions (low-level injection, quasi-neutral regions with negligible recombination, and reciprocity of carrier transport across the base), and derive a forward-model mapping from base–emitter voltage and base–collector voltage to the collector current and to the constant offset induced by the reverse-biased junction. Based on this mapping, design a linear-in-parameters extraction method for the unknown junction saturation currents, assuming the forward transport factor is known. Your method must be applicable to multiple data points of base–emitter voltage at a fixed base–collector voltage, and must explicitly handle the constant offset arising from a fixed reverse bias.\n\nYour program must implement the following steps.\n\n1) Synthetic data generation:\n- For each test case, generate synthetic collector-current data from a physically realistic model for a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), with base–emitter voltage samples $\\{V_{BE,i}\\}$ at a fixed base–collector voltage $V_{BC}$. Use the thermal voltage definition $V_{T} = k_{B} T / q$ only as a fundamental starting point; specific numerical values are provided in the test suite. Currents must be in amperes ($\\mathrm{A}$), and voltages in volts ($\\mathrm{V}$).\n\n2) Parameter extraction with known forward transport factor:\n- Assume the forward transport factor $\\alpha_{F}$ is known. Show how the mapping from $\\{V_{BE,i}\\}$ to the collector current $I_{C}$ at fixed $V_{BC}$ can be written so that the dependence on the emitter-side saturation current $I_{ES}$ is linear in a regressor constructed from $\\exp(V_{BE,i}/V_{T})$ and includes a constant offset due to the fixed $V_{BC}$. Use linear least squares over the multiple data points to extract both $I_{ES}$ and the collector-side saturation current $I_{CS}$, treating the constant offset as an unknown intercept. Express all extracted currents in amperes ($\\mathrm{A}$).\n\n3) Sensitivity of $I_{ES}$ to small thermal voltage error:\n- For each test case, repeat the extraction twice with a slightly misspecified thermal voltage $V_{T}^{\\pm} = V_{T} (1 \\pm \\varepsilon)$, where $\\varepsilon = 0.02$ is a small dimensionless error. Quantify the impact on the inferred emitter-side saturation current by reporting the ratios $R_{\\pm} = \\widehat{I}_{ES}(V_{T}^{\\pm}) / \\widehat{I}_{ES}(V_{T})$ as unitless decimal numbers.\n\n4) Output format:\n- For each test case, compute and return a list of four numbers: $\\left[\\widehat{I}_{ES}(V_{T}), \\widehat{I}_{CS}(V_{T}), R_{+}, R_{-}\\right]$, where the two currents are in amperes ($\\mathrm{A}$) and the two ratios are unitless decimals.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases concatenated and enclosed in a single pair of square brackets, with comma separation. For example, if there are three test cases, the output must be of the form:\n\"[Ies1,Ics1,Rp1,Rm1,Ies2,Ics2,Rp2,Rm2,Ies3,Ics3,Rp3,Rm3]\".\n- No additional text must be printed.\n\nTest suite specification:\nImplement exactly the following three test cases, each with its own synthetic data set:\n\n- Test case 1 (typical forward-active, room temperature):\n    - $I_{ES}^{\\text{true}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{A}$, $I_{CS}^{\\text{true}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{A}$, $\\alpha_{F} = 0.985$.\n    - $V_{T} = 2.585 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n    - $V_{BC} = -5.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n    - $V_{BE}$ samples: an arithmetic progression from $5.5 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{V}$ to $7.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{V}$ with step $1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{V}$ inclusive.\n\n- Test case 2 (different junction scales, moderate reverse bias):\n    - $I_{ES}^{\\text{true}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{A}$, $I_{CS}^{\\text{true}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{A}$, $\\alpha_{F} = 0.990$.\n    - $V_{T} = 2.585 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n    - $V_{BC} = -2.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n    - $V_{BE}$ samples: an arithmetic progression from $3.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{V}$ to $4.5 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{V}$ with step $1.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{V}$ inclusive.\n\n- Test case 3 (elevated thermal voltage, reduced transport factor):\n    - $I_{ES}^{\\text{true}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{A}$, $I_{CS}^{\\text{true}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{A}$, $\\alpha_{F} = 0.960$.\n    - $V_{T} = 3.470 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n    - $V_{BC} = -3.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n    - $V_{BE}$ samples: an arithmetic progression from $4.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{V}$ to $6.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{V}$ with step $2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{V}$ inclusive.\n\nAlgorithmic requirements and numerical details:\n- Use the ideal-junction exponential dependence without any series resistance, high-level injection, or Early effect corrections.\n- Construct, for each test case and each assumed thermal voltage, the regressor $x_{i} = \\exp(V_{BE,i}/V_{T}) - 1$ and fit a line $y_{i} = a x_{i} + b$ to the synthetic collector current data $\\{y_{i}\\}$ by least squares over all samples.

            "solution": "The problem posed is a valid exercise in semiconductor device modeling and parameter extraction. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all necessary parameters and conditions are specified. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe Ebers-Moll model provides a description of the large-signal behavior of a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT). This model is derived by considering the BJT as two interacting pn-junctions: the base-emitter (BE) junction and the base-collector (BC) junction. Under the ideal diode assumption, the current $I_D$ across a pn-junction is related to the voltage $V_D$ across it by the Shockley diode equation:\n$$\nI_D = I_S \\left( e^{V_D / V_T} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nwhere $I_S$ is the reverse saturation current and $V_T = k_B T / q$ is the thermal voltage, with $k_B$ being the Boltzmann constant, $T$ the absolute temperature, and $q$ the elementary charge.\n\nIn the Ebers-Moll model, the terminal currents of the BJT are expressed in terms of two such ideal diode currents, modified by transport factors that account for the collection of minority carriers injected across one junction by the other. The emitter current $I_E$ and collector current $I_C$ are given by the superposition of these coupled currents:\n$$\nI_E = I_{ES} \\left( e^{V_{BE} / V_T} - 1 \\right) - \\alpha_R I_{CS} \\left( e^{V_{BC} / V_T} - 1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nI_C = \\alpha_F I_{ES} \\left( e^{V_{BE} / V_T} - 1 \\right) - I_{CS} \\left( e^{V_{BC} / V_T} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nHere, $V_{BE}$ and $V_{BC}$ are the base-emitter and base-collector junction voltages. $I_{ES}$ and $I_{CS}$ are the saturation currents of the BE and BC junctions, respectively. The parameters $\\alpha_F$ and $\\alpha_R$ are the forward and reverse common-base current gains, which represent the efficiency of carrier transport across the base. The problem proceeds under the assumption of ideal transistor behavior, neglecting effects such as series resistance, high-level injection, and the Early effect.\n\n**1. Synthetic Data Generation**\nThe first step is to generate synthetic data for the collector current $I_C$ based on the Ebers-Moll model. For each test case, we are provided with true values for the model parameters ($I_{ES}^{\\text{true}}$, $I_{CS}^{\\text{true}}$, $\\alpha_F$), the thermal voltage $V_T$, a fixed base-collector voltage $V_{BC}$, and a set of base-emitter voltage samples $\\{V_{BE,i}\\}$. The synthetic collector current data points $\\{y_i\\}$ are calculated using the collector current equation:\n$$\ny_i = \\alpha_F I_{ES}^{\\text{true}} \\left( e^{V_{BE,i} / V_T} - 1 \\right) - I_{CS}^{\\text{true}} \\left( e^{V_{BC} / V_T} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nThis equation serves as our forward model for generating the data that will be used in the subsequent parameter extraction phase.\n\n**2. Parameter Extraction via Linear Regression**\nThe second step is to extract the saturation currents $I_{ES}$ and $I_{CS}$ from the synthetic data $\\{y_i, V_{BE,i}\\}$, assuming the transport factor $\\alpha_F$ and the voltages $V_{BC}$ and $V_T$ are known. To do this, we rearrange the collector current equation into a linear form suitable for regression.\nThe equation for $I_C$ can be written as:\n$$\nI_C = (\\alpha_F I_{ES}) \\left( e^{V_{BE} / V_T} - 1 \\right) + \\left[ -I_{CS} \\left( e^{V_{BC} / V_T} - 1 \\right) \\right]\n$$\nWe define a regressor variable $x = e^{V_{BE} / V_T} - 1$. Since the measurement is performed at a fixed $V_{BC}$, the second term is a constant. This allows us to express the relationship in the form of a linear equation $y = a x + b$:\n$$\ny = a x + b\n$$\nwhere:\n-   $y = I_C$ is the measured collector current.\n-   $x = e^{V_{BE} / V_T} - 1$ is the regressor, which depends on the swept voltage $V_{BE}$.\n-   $a = \\alpha_F I_{ES}$ is the slope of the line.\n-   $b = -I_{CS} \\left( e^{V_{BC} / V_T} - 1 \\right)$ is the intercept, which is constant for a fixed $V_{BC}$ and $V_T$.\n\nGiven a set of $N$ data points $(x_i, y_i)$, we can find the best-fit estimates for the slope, $\\widehat{a}$, and intercept, $\\widehat{b}$, using linear least squares. This involves minimizing the sum of squared residuals, $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - (a x_i + b))^2$. The solution can be found by solving a system of linear equations. We construct a design matrix $A$ and a vector of observations $\\mathbf{y}$:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1  1 \\\\ x_2  1 \\\\ \\vdots  \\vdots \\\\ x_N  1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_N \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe least-squares solution for the parameter vector $\\mathbf{p} = [\\widehat{a}, \\widehat{b}]^T$ is given by $\\mathbf{p} = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T \\mathbf{y}$.\n\nOnce $\\widehat{a}$ and $\\widehat{b}$ are determined, we can recover the estimates for the saturation currents, denoted $\\widehat{I}_{ES}$ and $\\widehat{I}_{CS}$:\nFrom the slope: $\\widehat{a} = \\alpha_F \\widehat{I}_{ES} \\implies \\widehat{I}_{ES} = \\frac{\\widehat{a}}{\\alpha_F}$.\nFrom the intercept: $\\widehat{b} = - \\widehat{I}_{CS} (e^{V_{BC} / V_T} - 1) \\implies \\widehat{I}_{CS} = -\\frac{\\widehat{b}}{e^{V_{BC} / V_T} - 1}$.\n\nSince the synthetic data is generated from the same model without noise, the extracted parameters $\\widehat{I}_{ES}(V_T)$ and $\\widehat{I}_{CS}(V_T)$ should be identical to the true values $I_{ES}^{\\text{true}}$ and $I_{CS}^{\\text{true}}$ used for data generation.\n\n**3. Sensitivity Analysis**\nThe final step is to quantify the sensitivity of the extracted emitter saturation current, $\\widehat{I}_{ES}$, to a small error in the thermal voltage $V_T$. We introduce a small dimensionless error $\\varepsilon = 0.02$ and define two perturbed thermal voltages:\n$$\nV_T^+ = V_T (1 + \\varepsilon) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad V_T^- = V_T (1 - \\varepsilon)\n$$\nThe parameter extraction process is then repeated twice, once with $V_T^+$ and once with $V_T^-$. It is critical to note that the synthetic data $\\{y_i\\}$ remains unchanged, as it represents the \"physical measurement\" generated using the nominal $V_T$. The error is in the $V_T$ value used during the analysis/extraction phase.\n\nFor $V_T^+$, a new set of regressors $\\{x_i^+\\}$ is calculated: $x_i^+ = e^{V_{BE,i} / V_T^+} - 1$. A linear fit of $y_i$ against $x_i^+$ yields a new slope $\\widehat{a}^+$, from which we find $\\widehat{I}_{ES}(V_T^+) = \\widehat{a}^+ / \\alpha_F$.\nSimilarly, for $V_T^-$, regressors $x_i^- = e^{V_{BE,i} / V_T^-} - 1$ are used to find $\\widehat{a}^-$, leading to $\\widehat{I}_{ES}(V_T^-) = \\widehat{a}^- / \\alpha_F$.\n\nThe sensitivity is reported as the ratios $R_+$ and $R_-$:\n$$\nR_+ = \\frac{\\widehat{I}_{ES}(V_T^+)}{\\widehat{I}_{ES}(V_T)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad R_- = \\frac{\\widehat{I}_{ES}(V_T^-)}{\\widehat{I}_{ES}(V_T)}\n$$\nThese ratios quantify the fractional change in the extracted saturation current due to the small percentage error in the assumed thermal voltage. The final output for each test case is the list $[\\widehat{I}_{ES}(V_T), \\widehat{I}_{CS}(V_T), R_+, R_-]$.",
