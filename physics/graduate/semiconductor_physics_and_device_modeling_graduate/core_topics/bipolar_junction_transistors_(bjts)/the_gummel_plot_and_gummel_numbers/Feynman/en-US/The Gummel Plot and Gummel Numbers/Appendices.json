            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the forward current gain, $\\beta_{F}$, of an $n$-$p$-$n$ Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) with linearly graded doping profiles in both the emitter and the base. The analysis will be based on the one-dimensional drift-diffusion transport model under the assumptions of low-level injection and negligible recombination in the quasi-neutral regions.\n\nThe forward current gain $\\beta_{F}$ is defined as the ratio of the collector current $I_{C}$ to the base current $I_{B}$. Assuming a uniform emitter area, this is equivalent to the ratio of the respective current densities, $\\beta_{F} = J_{C}/J_{B}$. The collector current is due to the injection of electrons from the emitter into the base, which then diffuse and drift across the base to be collected at the collector junction. The base current, under the given assumption of negligible recombination, is solely due to the injection of holes from the base into the emitter.\n\n**1. Collector Current Density ($J_{C}$)**\n\nThe collector current is carried by electrons traversing the quasi-neutral base, which spans from $x=0$ to $x=W_{B}$. The electron current density, $J_{n}(x)$, is given by the drift-diffusion equation:\n$$J_{n}(x) = q D_{n,B} \\frac{dn(x)}{dx} + q \\mu_{n,B} n(x) E(x)$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $D_{n,B}$ and $\\mu_{n,B}$ are the electron diffusivity and mobility in the base, $n(x)$ is the minority electron concentration, and $E(x)$ is the electric field in the quasi-neutral base.\n\nUnder low-level injection, the majority carrier (hole) concentration is approximately equal to the acceptor doping concentration, $p(x) \\approx N_{A}(x)$. A built-in electric field exists due to the doping gradient. This field is established to counteract the diffusion of majority carriers, resulting in nearly zero net majority carrier current. Thus, for holes in the base, $J_{p}(x) \\approx 0$:\n$$J_{p}(x) = q \\mu_{p,B} p(x) E(x) - q D_{p,B} \\frac{dp(x)}{dx} \\approx 0$$\nSolving for the electric field and using $p(x) \\approx N_{A}(x)$ and the Einstein relation $D_{p,B} = \\mu_{p,B} V_{T}$:\n$$E(x) \\approx \\frac{D_{p,B}}{\\mu_{p,B}} \\frac{1}{p(x)} \\frac{dp(x)}{dx} = V_{T} \\frac{1}{N_{A}(x)} \\frac{dN_{A}(x)}{dx}$$\nwhere $V_{T} = k_{B}T/q$ is the thermal voltage.\n\nSubstituting this field into the electron current equation and using the Einstein relation for electrons ($D_{n,B} = \\mu_{n,B} V_{T}$):\n$$J_{n}(x) = q D_{n,B} \\frac{dn(x)}{dx} + q \\mu_{n,B} n(x) \\left(V_{T} \\frac{1}{N_{A}(x)} \\frac{dN_{A}(x)}{dx}\\right)$$\n$$J_{n}(x) = q D_{n,B} \\left( \\frac{dn(x)}{dx} + \\frac{n(x)}{N_{A}(x)} \\frac{dN_{A}(x)}{dx} \\right) = \\frac{q D_{n,B}}{N_{A}(x)} \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( n(x) N_{A}(x) \\right)$$\nSince recombination in the base is neglected, $J_{n}$ is constant throughout the quasi-neutral base. We can rearrange and integrate from $x=0$ to $x=W_{B}$:\n$$J_{n} \\int_{0}^{W_{B}} \\frac{N_{A}(x)}{q D_{n,B}} dx = \\left[ n(x) N_{A}(x) \\right]_{0}^{W_{B}} = n(W_{B})N_{A}(W_{B}) - n(0)N_{A}(0)$$\nThe boundary conditions in forward active mode are:\n1. At the emitter-base junction ($x=0$), the law of the junction gives $p(0)n(0) = n_{i}^{2}\\exp(V_{BE}/V_{T})$. With low injection, $p(0) \\approx N_{A}(0)$, so $n(0) \\approx \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{A}(0)}\\exp(V_{BE}/V_{T})$.\n2. At the reverse-biased collector-base junction ($x=W_{B}$), the electron concentration is depleted, so $n(W_{B}) \\approx 0$.\n\nSubstituting these conditions:\n$$J_{n} \\frac{1}{q D_{n,B}} \\int_{0}^{W_{B}} N_{A}(x) dx = - n(0)N_{A}(0) = -n_{i}^{2}\\exp(V_{BE}/V_{T})$$\nThe collector current flows in the $+x$ direction, but electrons have negative charge, so $J_{C} = -J_{n}$.\n$$J_{C} = \\frac{q D_{n,B} n_{i}^{2} \\exp(V_{BE}/V_{T})}{\\int_{0}^{W_{B}} N_{A}(x) dx}$$\nThe integral in the denominator is the base Gummel number, $G_{B}$, representing the total acceptor atoms per unit area in the quasi-neutral base.\n$$G_{B} = \\int_{0}^{W_{B}} N_{A}(x) dx$$\nThus, $J_{C} = \\frac{q D_{n,B} n_{i}^{2}}{G_{B}} \\exp(V_{BE}/V_{T})$.\n\n**2. Base Current Density ($J_{B}$)**\n\nThe base current is due to hole injection into the emitter. We perform an analogous analysis for the minority hole current in the $n$-type emitter. Let the coordinate into the emitter be $x'$, from $x'=0$ (depletion edge) to $x'=W_{E}$ (emitter contact). The hole current density is:\n$$J_{pE}(x') = q \\mu_{p,E} p(x') E'(x') - q D_{p,E} \\frac{dp(x')}{dx'}$$\nThe built-in field $E'(x')$ from the donor gradient $N_{D}(x')$ is found by setting the majority electron current to zero: $E'(x') = -V_{T}\\frac{1}{N_{D}(x')}\\frac{dN_{D}(x')}{dx'}$.\nSubstituting this into the hole current equation:\n$$J_{pE}(x') = - \\frac{q D_{p,E}}{N_{D}(x')} \\frac{d}{dx'} \\left( p(x') N_{D}(x') \\right)$$\nIntegrating from $x'=0$ to $x'=W_{E}$, assuming constant $J_{pE}$ (no recombination):\n$$J_{pE} \\int_{0}^{W_{E}} \\frac{N_{D}(x')}{q D_{p,E}} dx' = -\\left[ p(x') N_{D}(x') \\right]_{0}^{W_{E}} = p(0)N_{D}(0) - p(W_{E})N_{D}(W_{E})$$\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1. At the emitter-base junction ($x'=0$), $p(0) \\approx \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{D}(0)}\\exp(V_{BE}/V_{T})$.\n2. At the ohmic emitter contact ($x'=W_{E}$), thermal equilibrium is assumed, so $p(W_{E}) = p_{0E}(W_{E}) = n_{i}^{2}/N_{D}(W_{E})$.\n\nSubstituting these conditions:\n$$J_{pE} \\frac{1}{q D_{p,E}} \\int_{0}^{W_E} N_{D}(x') dx' = n_{i}^{2}\\exp(V_{BE}/V_{T}) - n_{i}^{2}$$\nFor forward active mode, $\\exp(V_{BE}/V_{T}) \\gg 1$. The base current density is $J_{B} = J_{pE}$.\n$$J_{B} \\approx \\frac{q D_{p,E} n_{i}^{2} \\exp(V_{BE}/V_{T})}{\\int_{0}^{W_{E}} N_{D}(x') dx'}$$\nThe integral is the emitter Gummel number, $G_{E}$:\n$$G_{E} = \\int_{0}^{W_{E}} N_{D}(x') dx'$$\nThus, $J_{B} = \\frac{q D_{p,E} n_{i}^{2}}{G_{E}} \\exp(V_{BE}/V_{T})$.\n\n**3. Current Gain ($\\beta_{F}$)**\n\nThe current gain $\\beta_{F}$ is the ratio $J_{C}/J_{B}$:\n$$\\beta_{F} = \\frac{J_{C}}{J_{B}} = \\frac{q D_{n,B} n_{i}^{2}/G_{B}}{q D_{p,E} n_{i}^{2}/G_{E}} = \\frac{D_{n,B}}{D_{p,E}} \\frac{G_{E}}{G_{B}}$$\nUsing the Einstein relation, $D=\\mu V_T$, the $V_T$ terms cancel:\n$$\\beta_{F} = \\frac{\\mu_{n,B}}{\\mu_{p,E}} \\frac{G_{E}}{G_{B}}$$\n\n**4. Evaluation of Gummel Numbers and $\\beta_{F}$**\n\nFirst, we evaluate the Gummel numbers using the given linear doping profiles.\n\nBase Gummel Number ($G_{B}$):\n$$G_{B} = \\int_{0}^{W_{B}} N_{A0}\\left(1+\\beta \\frac{x}{W_{B}}\\right) dx = N_{A0} \\left[x + \\frac{\\beta}{W_{B}}\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^{W_{B}} = N_{A0} \\left(W_{B} + \\frac{\\beta W_{B}}{2}\\right) = N_{A0}W_{B}\\left(1+\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$W_{B}=0.20\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.20 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm}$\n$N_{A0}=8.0\\times 10^{17}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$\\beta=0.50$\n$$G_{B} = (8.0\\times 10^{17}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3})(0.20 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm})\\left(1+\\frac{0.50}{2}\\right) = (1.6 \\times 10^{13}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2})(1.25) = 2.0 \\times 10^{13}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$$\n\nEmitter Gummel Number ($G_{E}$):\n$$G_{E} = \\int_{0}^{W_{E}} N_{D0}\\left(1+\\gamma \\frac{x'}{W_{E}}\\right) dx' = N_{D0} \\left[x' + \\frac{\\gamma}{W_{E}}\\frac{x'^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^{W_{E}} = N_{D0} \\left(W_{E} + \\frac{\\gamma W_{E}}{2}\\right) = N_{D0}W_{E}\\left(1+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$W_{E}=0.30\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.30 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm}$\n$N_{D0}=1.50\\times 10^{19}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$\\gamma=0.20$\n$$G_{E} = (1.50\\times 10^{19}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3})(0.30 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm})\\left(1+\\frac{0.20}{2}\\right) = (4.5 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2})(1.10) = 4.95 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate $\\beta_{F}$:\n$$\\beta_{F} = \\frac{\\mu_{n,B}}{\\mu_{p,E}} \\frac{G_{E}}{G_{B}}$$\nWith $\\mu_{n,B}=300\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\text{V}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$ and $\\mu_{p,E}=50\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\text{V}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$:\n$$\\beta_{F} = \\frac{300}{50} \\times \\frac{4.95 \\times 10^{14}}{2.0 \\times 10^{13}} = 6 \\times 24.75 = 148.5$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\beta_{F} \\approx 149$$\nThe forward current gain is a dimensionless quantity.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It presents a standard, well-posed problem in semiconductor device physics, based on established first principles of charge transport. The provided assumptions, parameters, and boundary conditions are self-contained and scientifically sound, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The task requires the derivation of fundamental current-voltage relationships for a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) and their numerical implementation, which is a classic and instructive exercise in the field.\n\nThe derivation of the collector current $I_C$ and base current $I_B$ proceeds from the drift-diffusion equations under the specified operating conditions and simplifying assumptions. The device is a one-dimensional NPN BJT in the forward-active region. The x-axis is defined as pointing from the emitter-base junction into the respective quasi-neutral regions.\n\nA key assumption provided is \"negligible electric field in quasi-neutral regions\". While this holds for uniformly doped regions, it is inconsistent with a graded doping profile (as in Case 2), which intentionally introduces a built-in electric field to aid minority carrier transport. The following derivation employs a more general method (the Moll-Ross relation) that correctly handles both uniform and graded profiles, thus accommodating all test cases. The result naturally simplifies to the zero-field case for uniform doping.\n\n**Derivation of Collector Current $I_C$**\n\nThe collector current is determined by the flux of minority electrons injected from the emitter and transported across the p-type base.\nUnder steady-state conditions and the crucial assumption of negligible recombination in the base (narrow-base approximation), the electron continuity equation $\\frac{1}{q}\\frac{dJ_n}{dx} = 0$ implies that the electron current density $J_n(x)$ is constant throughout the quasi-neutral base, from $x=0$ to $x=W_B$.\n\nThe electron current density, including both drift and diffusion components, is given by:\n$$J_n(x) = q \\mu_n n_p(x) \\mathcal{E}(x) + q D_n \\frac{dn_p(x)}{dx}$$\nwhere $n_p(x)$ is the minority electron concentration in the base. The electric field $\\mathcal{E}(x)$ arises from the gradient in the majority hole concentration, which under low-level injection is approximately the acceptor doping profile, $p_p(x) \\approx N_A(x)$. For near-zero net hole current ($J_p \\approx 0$), the field is given by $\\mathcal{E}(x) \\approx V_T \\frac{1}{N_A(x)}\\frac{dN_A(x)}{dx}$, where $V_T = k_B T / q$ is the thermal voltage. Substituting this field and the Einstein relation $D_n = \\mu_n V_T$ into the expression for $J_n$ yields:\n$$J_n(x) = q D_n \\left( \\frac{n_p(x)}{N_A(x)}\\frac{dN_A(x)}{dx} + \\frac{dn_p(x)}{dx} \\right) = \\frac{q D_n}{N_A(x)} \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( n_p(x) N_A(x) \\right)$$\nSince $J_n$ is constant, we can rearrange and integrate across the quasi-neutral base from $x=0$ to $x=W_B$:\n$$\\int_0^{W_B} \\frac{J_n N_A(x)}{q D_n} dx = \\int_0^{W_B} d(n_p(x)N_A(x))$$\n$$\\frac{J_n}{q D_n} \\int_0^{W_B} N_A(x) dx = \\left[ n_p(x) N_A(x) \\right]_0^{W_B} = n_p(W_B)N_A(W_B) - n_p(0)N_A(0)$$\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  At the emitter-base junction ($x=0$), the forward bias $V_{BE}$ establishes a minority carrier concentration according to the law of the junction: $n_p(0) = \\frac{n_i^2}{p_p(0)} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A(0)} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)$.\n2.  At the collector-base junction ($x=W_B$), the strong reverse bias sweeps away electrons, so their concentration is effectively zero: $n_p(W_B) \\approx 0$.\n\nSubstituting these conditions:\n$$\\frac{J_n}{q D_n} \\int_0^{W_B} N_A(x) dx = 0 - \\left( \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A(0)} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\right) N_A(0) = -n_i^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)$$\nThe collector current $I_C$ is the total electron current flowing into the collector over the device area $A$. By convention, electron flow in the $+x$ direction constitutes a negative current density. Thus, $I_C = -A J_n$.\n$$I_C = \\frac{A q D_n n_i^2}{\\int_0^{W_B} N_A(x) dx} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)$$\nThe integral in the denominator is the base Gummel number, $G_B$, representing the total acceptor atoms per unit area in the quasi-neutral base:\n$$G_B = \\int_0^{W_B} N_A(x) dx$$\nThus, the collector current is given by:\n$$I_C(V_{BE}) = \\frac{A q D_n n_i^2}{G_B} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)$$\n\n**Derivation of Base Current $I_B$**\n\nUnder the problem's stated assumptions, recombination in the base is negligible. Therefore, the base current is dominated by the component that supports the injection of majority carriers (holes) from the base into the n-type emitter. A symmetric analysis is performed for this hole current.\n\nTo obtain a result parameterized by the emitter Gummel number $G_E$, we must assume that recombination is also negligible in the quasi-neutral emitter region (a \"narrow emitter\" assumption). This is a reasonable inference given the structure of the problem. Thus, the hole current density $J_p(x')$ is constant across the emitter width $W_E$ (where $x'$ increases from the junction into the emitter).\nThe hole current density in the n-type emitter is:\n$$J_p(x') = q \\mu_p p_n(x') \\mathcal{E'}(x') - q D_p \\frac{dp_n(x')}{dx'}$$\nwhere the field is set by the majority electron gradient, $\\mathcal{E}'(x') \\approx -V_T \\frac{1}{N_D(x')}\\frac{dN_D(x')}{dx'}$. This leads to:\n$$J_p(x') = -\\frac{q D_p}{N_D(x')} \\frac{d}{dx'} \\left( p_n(x') N_D(x') \\right)$$\nIntegrating from the junction ($x'=0$) to the emitter contact ($x'=W_E$):\n$$\\frac{J_p}{q D_p} \\int_0^{W_E} N_D(x') dx' = - \\left[ p_n(x') N_D(x') \\right]_0^{W_E} = p_n(0)N_D(0) - p_n(W_E)N_D(W_E)$$\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  At the junction ($x'=0$): $p_n(0) \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D(0)} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)$.\n2.  At the ohmic emitter contact ($x'=W_E$): surface recombination is high, maintaining thermal equilibrium concentration, $p_n(W_E) = p_{n0}(W_E) = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D(W_E)}$.\n\nSubstituting these conditions yields:\n$$\\frac{J_p}{q D_p} \\int_0^{W_E} N_D(x') dx' = \\left(\\frac{n_i^2}{N_D(0)}\\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)\\right)N_D(0) - \\left(\\frac{n_i^2}{N_D(W_E)}\\right)N_D(W_E) = n_i^2 \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nFor typical forward bias, $\\exp(V_{BE}/V_T) \\gg 1$. The base current is $I_B = A J_p$.\n$$I_B \\approx \\frac{A q D_p n_i^2}{\\int_0^{W_E} N_D(x) dx} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)$$\nThe integral is the emitter Gummel number, $G_E$:\n$$G_E = \\int_0^{W_E} N_D(x) dx$$\nThus, the base current is given by:\n$$I_B(V_{BE}) = \\frac{A q D_p n_i^2}{G_E} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)$$\n\n**Summary and Numerical Validation Plan**\n\nThe derived expressions for the collector and base currents are:\n$$I_C(V_{BE}) = I_{S,C} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\quad \\text{with pre-exponential factor} \\quad I_{S,C} = \\frac{A q D_n n_i^2}{G_B}$$\n$$I_B(V_{BE}) = I_{S,B} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\quad \\text{with pre-exponential factor} \\quad I_{S,B} = \\frac{A q D_p n_i^2}{G_E}$$\nThese equations explicitly show that the Gummel numbers $G_B$ and $G_E$ parameterize the pre-exponential factors of $I_C$ and $I_B$, respectively.\n\nThe common-emitter current gain, $\\beta$, is the ratio of collector current to base current:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{I_C}{I_B} = \\frac{I_{S,C}}{I_{S,B}} = \\frac{D_n}{D_p} \\frac{G_E}{G_B}$$\nUnder these ideal assumptions, $\\beta$ is a constant, independent of the bias voltage.\n\nThe numerical implementation will perform the following steps for each test case:\n1.  Define the doping profile functions $N_A(x)$ and $N_D(x)$.\n2.  Numerically compute the Gummel numbers $G_B = \\int_0^{W_B} N_A(x)dx$ and $G_E = \\int_0^{W_E} N_D(x)dx$ using numerical quadrature.\n3.  Calculate the thermal voltage $V_T = k_B T / q$.\n4.  Compute the saturation currents $I_{S,C}$ and $I_{S,B}$ using the derived formulas.\n5.  For each given $V_{BE}$, calculate $I_C$ and $I_B$.\n6.  For slope validation, perform a linear least-squares regression on the points $(\\{V_{BE}^{(i)}\\}, \\{\\ln I_C^{(i)}\\})$ and $(\\{V_{BE}^{(i)}\\}, \\{\\ln I_B^{(i)}\\})$. The theoretical slope is $1/V_T$. The computed slopes are checked against this value within a relative tolerance of $0.01$.\n7.  For $\\beta$ validation, compute the theoretical $\\beta = (D_n/D_p)(G_E/G_B)$. Then, calculate the \"measured\" $\\beta$ at the midpoint $V_{BE}$ and check if its relative error with respect to the theoretical value is less than $0.02$.\nThe results of these three validation checks (two slopes, one $\\beta$) will be reported as a list of three booleans for each case.",

            "solution": "The problem statement provides a detailed and physically consistent description of a silicon npn Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) and its characterization via a Gummel plot. The specified device parameters, operating conditions, and observed electrical characteristics are all standard and well-established within semiconductor device physics. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is therefore valid for analysis.\n\nThe core of the problem involves analyzing the collector current ($I_C$) and base current ($I_B$) in the forward-active, low-injection regime. In an npn BJT, the collector current is due to electrons injected from the emitter, which successfully traverse the base and are collected by the collector. Under low-level injection and neglecting base-width modulation (since $V_{CB}$ is fixed), the collector current is given by the Moll-Ross relation:\n$$I_C = \\frac{A_E q n_i^2}{G_B} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{BE}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $A_E$ is the emitter area, $q$ is the elementary charge, $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration, $V_{BE}$ is the base-emitter voltage, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The quantity $G_B$ is the base Gummel number, defined as the integral of the net acceptor concentration divided by the electron diffusivity across the neutral base of width $W_B$:\n$$G_B = \\int_{0}^{W_B} \\frac{N_A(x)}{D_n(x)} \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\nThis formulation correctly accounts for a non-uniform base doping profile $N_A(x)$ and position-dependent diffusivity $D_n(x)$. The built-in electric field from the graded base is implicitly included in this integral formulation.\n\nThe base current $I_B$ is composed of several components: hole injection into the emitter ($I_{B,E}$), recombination in the quasi-neutral base ($I_{B,Bulk}$), and recombination in the emitter-base space-charge region ($I_{B,SCR}$).\n- $I_{B,E}$ and $I_{B,Bulk}$ are proportional to $n_p(0) \\propto \\exp(qV_{BE}/k_B T)$, and thus have an ideality factor of $\\eta_B=1$.\n- $I_{B,SCR}$ is proportional to $n_i \\exp(qV_{BE}/(2k_B T))$, having an ideality factor of $\\eta_B=2$.\n\nThe problem states that for small $V_{BE}$, the observed slope of $\\ln I_B$ versus $V_{BE}$ corresponds to an ideality factor of approximately $2$. This indicates that at low forward bias, the base current is dominated by recombination in the emitter-base space-charge region: $I_B \\approx I_{B,SCR}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In the low-injection regime with negligible series resistance, a slope $\\mathrm{d}(\\ln I_{C})/\\mathrm{d}V_{BE}\\approx q/k_{B}T$ indicates diffusion-dominated transport across the emitter-base junction; concluding that the ideality factor for $I_{C}$ is exactly $1$ independently of the base doping gradient is valid in that regime.**\nThe collector current is given by the Moll-Ross relation $I_C = (A_E q n_i^2 / G_B) \\exp(qV_{BE}/k_B T)$. Taking the natural logarithm gives $\\ln I_C = \\ln(A_E q n_i^2 / G_B) + qV_{BE}/k_B T$. In the low-injection regime with fixed $V_{CB}$, the base Gummel number $G_B$ is independent of $V_{BE}$. Therefore, the derivative is $\\mathrm{d}(\\ln I_C)/\\mathrm{d}V_{BE} = q/k_B T$. This corresponds to an ideality factor $\\eta_C = 1$. This result is a direct consequence of the Boltzmann relation for injected carrier density, $n_p(0) = (n_i^2/N_A(0))\\exp(qV_{BE}/k_B T)$, and holds true regardless of the doping profile $N_A(x)$ in the base. The doping profile, whether uniform or graded, only affects the pre-exponential factor through $G_B$. The statement is therefore correct. The phrase \"diffusion-dominated transport across the emitter-base junction\" may be slightly imprecise, as the relationship stems from the injection mechanism governed by Boltzmann statistics, while transport *within* the base can be a combination of drift and diffusion, but this does not invalidate the statement's conclusion.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The base Gummel number increases when the base doping $N_{A}(x)$ is increased or when the minority electron diffusivity $D_{n}(x)$ is reduced; neglecting the doping dependence of carrier mobility when estimating the base Gummel number from the doping profile leads to systematic underestimation of the base Gummel number.**\nThe base Gummel number is $G_B = \\int_{0}^{W_B} [N_A(x)/D_n(x)] \\, \\mathrm{d}x$. The integrand is directly proportional to the doping $N_A(x)$ and inversely proportional to the diffusivity $D_n(x)$. Therefore, increasing $N_A(x)$ or decreasing $D_n(x)$ will increase the value of the integral, so $G_B$ increases. This confirms the first part of the statement.\nFor the second part, we consider the effect of doping on mobility $\\mu_n$ (and thus on diffusivity $D_n = \\mu_n k_B T / q$). Carrier mobility is known to decrease as the doping concentration increases due to enhanced impurity scattering. If one \"neglects\" this dependence, one typically assumes a constant mobility, likely a value corresponding to lower doping, which is higher than the actual mobility in the more heavily doped regions of the base. Let this overestimated diffusivity be $D_{n,approx}$ and the actual, doping-dependent diffusivity be $D_{n,actual}(x)$. We have $D_{n,approx}  D_{n,actual}(x)$. The approximate Gummel number would be $G_{B,approx} = \\int_{0}^{W_B} N_A(x)/D_{n,approx} \\, \\mathrm{d}x$, while the actual one is $G_{B,actual} = \\int_{0}^{W_B} N_A(x)/D_{n,actual}(x) \\, \\mathrmd{x}$. Since the denominator $D_{n,approx}$ is larger than $D_{n,actual}(x)$, the integrand in the approximation is smaller, leading to $G_{B,approx}  G_{B,actual}$. Thus, neglecting the doping dependence of mobility leads to a systematic underestimation of the base Gummel number.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Extracting a bulk minority-carrier lifetime in the base by fitting $I_{B}(V_{BE})$ with an ideality factor of $2$ on the Gummel plot is valid even if the base is substantially depleted near the collector-side junction under the applied $V_{CB}$.**\nThe problem states that the measured base current $I_B$ exhibits an ideality factor $\\eta_B \\approx 2$ at low $V_{BE}$. This behavior is characteristic of recombination current in the emitter-base space-charge region, $I_{B,SCR}$. The magnitude of this current is related to the effective carrier lifetime within the space-charge region, $\\tau_{SCR}$. In contrast, the recombination of minority carriers in the bulk of the neutral base, $I_{B,Bulk}$, depends on the bulk minority-carrier lifetime $\\tau_{n_0}$ and has an ideality factor of $\\eta_B=1$. It is physically incorrect to attempt to extract a parameter associated with a physical process having $\\eta_B=1$ (bulk recombination) by fitting a curve that is dominated by a process with $\\eta_B=2$ (SCR recombination). The two lifetimes, $\\tau_{n_0}$ and $\\tau_{SCR}$, are distinct parameters related to different physical regions and mechanisms. The information about depletion at the collector side (Early effect) is a secondary detail; the primary flaw is the mismatch between the observed phenomenon ($\\eta_B=2$) and the parameter to be extracted ($\\tau_{n_0}$, related to $\\eta_B=1$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The ratio $I_{C}/I_{B}$ in the low-injection regime provides a direct measure of the emitter injection efficiency $\\gamma_{E}$, provided the base transport factor is close to unity; overlooking surface recombination in the emitter will bias the inferred $\\gamma_{E}$ toward lower values.**\nThe current gain $\\beta = I_C/I_B$ is related to the emitter injection efficiency $\\gamma_E$ and base transport factor $\\alpha_T$ by $\\beta = (\\gamma_E \\alpha_T) / (1 - \\gamma_E \\alpha_T)$. If $\\alpha_T \\approx 1$, then $\\beta \\approx \\gamma_E / (1 - \\gamma_E)$. While $\\gamma_E$ can be calculated from $\\beta$, this relationship itself relies on the assumption that the base current $I_B$ is composed of components that define $\\gamma_E$ and $\\alpha_T$. Specifically, $I_B = I_{B,E} + I_{B,Bulk}$ (ignoring other effects for a moment), where $I_{B,E}$ is the back-injected hole current defining $\\gamma_E$ and $I_{B,Bulk}$ is the base recombination defining $\\alpha_T$. Both of these currents have an ideality factor $\\eta_B=1$. The problem explicitly states that in the low-bias regime, the measured $I_B$ has $\\eta_B \\approx 2$, meaning $I_B \\approx I_{B,SCR}$. In this specific regime, the ratio $I_C/I_B \\approx I_C/I_{B,SCR}$, which is heavily voltage-dependent and has no direct relationship with the emitter injection efficiency $\\gamma_E$. The statement's premise is valid only in a different bias range (typically higher $V_{BE}$) where the $\\eta_B=1$ components of base current dominate. Therefore, the first part of the statement is incorrect under the conditions given in the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. For a graded base, computing the base Gummel number as $G_{B}\\approx W_{B}\\,N_{A}^{\\mathrm{avg}}/D_{n}^{\\mathrm{avg}}$ is a reasonable first-order approximation to the exact definition $G_{B}=\\int_{0}^{W_{B}}\\!\\! \\frac{N_{A}(x)}{D_{n}(x)}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$, and captures the leading dependence on base width, doping, and diffusivity when the grading is not extreme.**\nThe exact definition is $G_{B}=\\int_{0}^{W_{B}} (N_{A}(x)/D_{n}(x))\\,\\mathrm{d}x$. The approximation simplifies this to a product of the base width $W_B$ and average values of doping $N_A^{\\mathrm{avg}}$ and diffusivity $D_n^{\\mathrm{avg}}$. This is a very common engineering approximation. For a simple case of a linearly graded base $N_A(x)$ and a constant diffusivity $D_n$, the integral evaluates exactly to $G_B = (W_B/D_n) \\times [(N_A(0)+N_A(W_B))/2] = W_B N_A^{\\mathrm{avg}}/D_n$. In a more realistic scenario, $D_n$ also varies with doping, but for a \"not extreme\" grading (e.g., the factor of $2$ given, from $10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ down to $5\\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$), the variation in $D_n$ is modest. The approximation correctly identifies the primary dependencies of $G_B$: linear in $W_B$, proportional to the overall doping level $N_A$, and inversely proportional to the diffusivity $D_n$. As a \"first-order approximation,\" it is indeed \"reasonable\" and widely used for estimations and to understand scaling trends.\n**Verdict: Correct**",
