Assuming a uniform emitter area, this is equivalent to the ratio of the respective current densities, $\\beta_{F} = J_{C}/J_{B}$.\n\n**1. Collector and Base Currents in terms of Gummel Numbers**\n\nAs derived in the main text, under low-level injection and assuming negligible recombination, the collector and base current densities are given by:\n$$J_{C} = \\frac{q n_i^2}{G_B} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)$$\n$$J_{B} = \\frac{q n_i^2}{G_E} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)$$\nwhere $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration (assumed equal in base and emitter for a homojunction BJT), and $G_B$ and $G_E$ are the transport-based Gummel numbers:\n$$G_B = \\int_0^{W_B} \\frac{N_A(x)}{D_{n,B}} dx \\quad \\text{and} \\quad G_E = \\int_0^{W_E} \\frac{N_D(x)}{D_{p,E}} dx$$\nThe problem states that the mobilities, and thus the diffusivities ($D = \\mu V_T$), are constant within the base and emitter regions, respectively. Therefore, we can pull the constant diffusivities out of the integrals.\n\n**2. Current Gain ($\\beta_{F}$)**\n\nThe current gain $\\beta_{F}$ is the ratio $J_{C}/J_{B}$:\n$$\\beta_{F} = \\frac{J_{C}}{J_{B}} = \\frac{q n_i^2/G_B}{q n_i^2/G_E} = \\frac{G_E}{G_B}$$\nSubstituting the definitions of the Gummel numbers with constant diffusivities:\n$$\\beta_F = \\frac{\\int_0^{W_E} \\frac{N_D(x)}{D_{p,E}} dx}{\\int_0^{W_B} \\frac{N_A(x)}{D_{n,B}} dx} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{D_{p,E}} \\int_0^{W_E} N_D(x) dx}{\\frac{1}{D_{n,B}} \\int_0^{W_B} N_A(x) dx} = \\frac{D_{n,B}}{D_{p,E}} \\frac{\\int_0^{W_E} N_D(x) dx}{\\int_0^{W_B} N_A(x) dx}$$\nUsing the Einstein relation, $D = \\mu V_T$, the $V_T$ terms cancel:\n$$\\beta_{F} = \\frac{\\mu_{n,B}}{\\mu_{p,E}} \\frac{\\int_0^{W_E} N_D(x) dx}{\\int_0^{W_B} N_A(x) dx}$$\nThis shows that even when starting from the transport-based Gummel numbers, the final expression for gain under constant mobility involves the ratio of the integrated doping profiles (or charge-based Gummel numbers).\n\n**3.

The task requires the derivation of fundamental current-voltage relationships for a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) and their numerical implementation.\n\n**Derivation of Collector Current $I_C$ and Base Current $I_B$**\n\nAs established in the main text of the article, under the conditions of forward-active operation, low-level injection, and negligible recombination, the collector and base currents are determined by minority carrier transport across the base and emitter regions, respectively. The current-voltage relationships are parameterized by the transport-based Gummel numbers.\n\nThe collector current $I_C$ is determined by the flux of minority electrons injected from the emitter and transported across the p-type base.\n$$I_C(V_{BE}) = \\frac{A q n_i^2}{G_B} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nwhere $A$ is the emitter area, $q$ is the elementary charge, $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration, and $V_T$ is the thermal voltage. $G_B$ is the base Gummel number, defined as:\n$$G_B = \\int_0^{W_B} \\frac{N_A(x)}{D_n} dx$$\nSince the electron diffusion coefficient $D_n$ is assumed constant, it can be taken out of the integral:\n$$G_B = \\frac{1}{D_n} \\int_0^{W_B} N_A(x) dx$$\n\nSimilarly, the base current $I_B$ is dominated by the injection of holes from the base into the n-type emitter.\n$$I_B(V_{BE}) = \\frac{A q n_i^2}{G_E} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nwhere $G_E$ is the emitter Gummel number:\n$$G_E = \\int_0^{W_E} \\frac{N_D(x)}{D_p} dx = \\frac{1}{D_p} \\int_0^{W_E} N_D(x) dx$$\nFor the forward biases given in the problem, $\\exp(V_{BE}/V_T) \\gg 1$, so the `-1` term can be neglected.

Compute the saturation currents $I_{S,C}$ and $I_{S,B}$ using the derived formulas.\n6.  For each given $V_{BE}$, calculate $I_C$ and $I_B$.\n7.

            "solution": "The problem statement provides a detailed and physically consistent description of a silicon npn Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) and its characterization via a Gummel plot. The specified device parameters, operating conditions, and observed electrical characteristics are all standard and well-established within semiconductor device physics. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is therefore valid for analysis.\n\nThe core of the problem involves analyzing the collector current ($I_C$) and base current ($I_B$) in the forward-active, low-injection regime. In an npn BJT, the collector current is due to electrons injected from the emitter, which successfully traverse the base and are collected by the collector. Under low-level injection and neglecting base-width modulation (since $V_{CB}$ is fixed), the collector current is given by the Moll-Ross relation:\n$$I_C = \\frac{A_E q n_i^2}{G_B} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{BE}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $A_E$ is the emitter area, $q$ is the elementary charge, $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration, $V_{BE}$ is the base-emitter voltage, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The quantity $G_B$ is the base Gummel number, defined as the transport integral:\n$$G_B = \\int_{0}^{W_B} \\frac{N_A(x)}{D_n(x)} \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\nThis formulation correctly accounts for a non-uniform base doping profile $N_A(x)$ and position-dependent diffusivity $D_n(x)$. The built-in electric field from the graded base is implicitly included in this integral formulation.\n\nThe base current $I_B$ is composed of several components: hole injection into the emitter ($I_{B,E}$), recombination in the quasi-neutral base ($I_{B,Bulk}$), and recombination in the emitter-base space-charge region ($I_{B,SCR}$).\n- $I_{B,E}$ and $I_{B,Bulk}$ are proportional to $n_p(0) \\propto \\exp(qV_{BE}/k_B T)$, and thus have an ideality factor of $\\eta_B=1$.\n- $I_{B,SCR}$ is proportional to $n_i \\exp(qV_{BE}/(2k_B T))$, having an ideality factor of $\\eta_B=2$.\n\nThe problem states that for small $V_{BE}$, the observed slope of $\\ln I_B$ versus $V_{BE}$ corresponds to an ideality factor of approximately $2$. This indicates that at low forward bias, the base current is dominated by recombination in the emitter-base space-charge region: $I_B \\approx I_{B,SCR}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In the low-injection regime with negligible series resistance, a slope $\\mathrm{d}(\\ln I_{C})/\\mathrm{d}V_{BE}\\approx q/k_{B}T$ indicates diffusion-dominated transport across the emitter-base junction; concluding that the ideality factor for $I_{C}$ is exactly $1$ independently of the base doping gradient is valid in that regime.**\nThe collector current is given by the Moll-Ross relation $I_C = (A_E q n_i^2 / G_B) \\exp(qV_{BE}/k_B T)$. Taking the natural logarithm gives $\\ln I_C = \\ln(A_E q n_i^2 / G_B) + qV_{BE}/k_B T$. In the low-injection regime with fixed $V_{CB}$, the base Gummel number $G_B$ is independent of $V_{BE}$. Therefore, the derivative is $\\mathrm{d}(\\ln I_C)/\\mathrm{d}V_{BE} = q/k_B T$. This corresponds to an ideality factor $\\eta_C = 1$. This result is a direct consequence of the Boltzmann relation for injected carrier density, $n_p(0) = (n_i^2/N_A(0))\\exp(qV_{BE}/k_B T)$, and holds true regardless of the doping profile $N_A(x)$ in the base. The doping profile, whether uniform or graded, only affects the pre-exponential factor through $G_B$. The statement is therefore correct. The phrase \"diffusion-dominated transport across the emitter-base junction\" is a slight misnomer (the relationship stems from the injection mechanism), but it doesn't invalidate the main conclusion.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The base Gummel number increases when the base doping $N_{A}(x)$ is increased or when the minority electron diffusivity $D_{n}(x)$ is reduced; neglecting the doping dependence of carrier mobility when estimating the base Gummel number from the doping profile leads to systematic underestimation of the base Gummel number.**\nThe base Gummel number is $G_B = \\int_{0}^{W_B} [N_A(x)/D_n(x)] \\, \\mathrm{d}x$. The integrand is directly proportional to the doping $N_A(x)$ and inversely proportional to the diffusivity $D_n(x)$. Therefore, increasing $N_A(x)$ or decreasing $D_n(x)$ will increase the value of the integral, so $G_B$ increases. This confirms the first part of the statement.\nFor the second part, we consider the effect of doping on mobility $\\mu_n$ (and thus on diffusivity $D_n = \\mu_n k_B T / q$). Carrier mobility is known to decrease as the doping concentration increases due to enhanced impurity scattering. If one \"neglects\" this dependence, one typically assumes a constant mobility, likely a value corresponding to lower doping, which is higher than the actual mobility in the more heavily doped regions of the base. Let this overestimated diffusivity be $D_{n,approx}$ and the actual, doping-dependent diffusivity be $D_{n,actual}(x)$. We have $D_{n,approx} > D_{n,actual}(x)$. The approximate Gummel number would be $G_{B,approx} = \\int_{0}^{W_B} N_A(x)/D_{n,approx} \\, \\mathrm{d}x$, while the actual one is $G_{B,actual} = \\int_{0}^{W_B} N_A(x)/D_{n,actual}(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$. Since the denominator $D_{n,approx}$ is larger than $D_{n,actual}(x)$, the integrand in the approximation is smaller, leading to $G_{B,approx}  G_{B,actual}$. Thus, neglecting the doping dependence of mobility leads to a systematic underestimation of the base Gummel number.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Extracting a bulk minority-carrier lifetime in the base by fitting $I_{B}(V_{BE})$ with an ideality factor of $2$ on the Gummel plot is valid even if the base is substantially depleted near the collector-side junction under the applied $V_{CB}$.**\nThe problem states that the measured base current $I_B$ exhibits an ideality factor $\\eta_B \\approx 2$ at low $V_{BE}$. This behavior is characteristic of recombination current in the emitter-base space-charge region, $I_{B,SCR}$. The magnitude of this current is related to the effective carrier lifetime within the space-charge region, $\\tau_{SCR}$. In contrast, the recombination of minority carriers in the bulk of the neutral base, $I_{B,Bulk}$, depends on the bulk minority-carrier lifetime $\\tau_{n_0}$ and has an ideality factor of $\\eta_B=1$. It is physically incorrect to attempt to extract a parameter associated with a physical process having $\\eta_B=1$ (bulk recombination) by fitting a curve that is dominated by a process with $\\eta_B=2$ (SCR recombination). The two lifetimes, $\\tau_{n_0}$ and $\\tau_{SCR}$, are distinct parameters related to different physical regions and mechanisms. The information about depletion at the collector side (Early effect) is a secondary detail; the primary flaw is the mismatch between the observed phenomenon ($\\eta_B=2$) and the parameter to be extracted ($\\tau_{n_0}$, related to $\\eta_B=1$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The ratio $I_{C}/I_{B}$ in the low-injection regime provides a direct measure of the emitter injection efficiency $\\gamma_{E}$, provided the base transport factor is close to unity; overlooking surface recombination in the emitter will bias the inferred $\\gamma_{E}$ toward lower values.**\nThe current gain $\\beta = I_C/I_B$ is related to the emitter injection efficiency $\\gamma_E$ and base transport factor $\\alpha_T$ by $\\beta = (\\gamma_E \\alpha_T) / (1 - \\gamma_E \\alpha_T)$. If $\\alpha_T \\approx 1$, then $\\beta \\approx \\gamma_E / (1 - \\gamma_E)$. While $\\gamma_E$ can be calculated from $\\beta$, this relationship relies on the assumption that the base current $I_B$ is composed of components that define $\\gamma_E$ and $\\alpha_T$. Specifically, $I_B = I_{B,E} + I_{B,Bulk}$ (ignoring other effects for a moment), where $I_{B,E}$ is the back-injected hole current defining $\\gamma_E$ and $I_{B,Bulk}$ is the base recombination defining $\\alpha_T$. Both of these currents have an ideality factor of $\\eta_B=1$. The problem explicitly states that in the low-bias regime, the measured $I_B$ has $\\eta_B \\approx 2$, meaning $I_B \\approx I_{B,SCR}$. In this specific regime, the ratio $I_C/I_B \\approx I_C/I_{B,SCR}$, which is heavily voltage-dependent and has no direct relationship with the emitter injection efficiency $\\gamma_E$. The statement's premise is valid only in a different bias range (typically higher $V_{BE}$) where the $\\eta_B=1$ components of base current dominate. Therefore, the first part of the statement is incorrect under the conditions given in the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. For a graded base, computing the base Gummel number as $G_{B}\\approx W_{B}\\,N_{A}^{\\mathrm{avg}}/D_{n}^{\\mathrm{avg}}$ is a reasonable first-order approximation to the exact definition $G_{B}=\\int_{0}^{W_{B}}\\!\\! \\frac{N_{A}(x)}{D_{n}(x)}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$, and captures the leading dependence on base width, doping, and diffusivity when the grading is not extreme.**\nThe exact definition is $G_{B}=\\int_{0}^{W_{B}} (N_{A}(x)/D_{n}(x))\\,\\mathrm{d}x$. The approximation simplifies this to a product of the base width $W_B$ and average values of doping $N_A^{\\mathrm{avg}}$ and diffusivity $D_n^{\\mathrm{avg}}$. This is a very common engineering approximation. For a simple case of a linearly graded base $N_A(x)$ and a constant diffusivity $D_n$, the integral evaluates exactly to $G_B = (W_B/D_n) \\times [(N_A(0)+N_A(W_B))/2] = W_B N_A^{\\mathrm{avg}}/D_n$. In a more realistic scenario, $D_n$ also varies with doping, but for a \"not extreme\" grading (e.g., the factor of $2$ given, from $10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ down to $5\\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$), the variation in $D_n$ is modest. The approximation correctly identifies the primary dependencies of $G_B$: linear in $W_B$, proportional to the overall doping level $N_A$, and inversely proportional to the diffusivity $D_n$. As a \"first-order approximation,\" it is indeed \"reasonable\" and widely used for estimations and to understand scaling trends.\n**Verdict: Correct**",
