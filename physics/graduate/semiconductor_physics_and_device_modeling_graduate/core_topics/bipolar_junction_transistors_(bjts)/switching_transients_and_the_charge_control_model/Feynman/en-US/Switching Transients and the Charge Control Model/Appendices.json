            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the time-dependent areal stored excess carrier charge density, $Q_A(t)$, in a semiconductor slab under specific initial and boundary conditions. The solution must be obtained using a charge-control model based on an approximation involving the steady-state carrier profile.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing physical equations. The transport of excess minority carriers, $\\Delta n(x,t)$, is described by the one-dimensional continuity equation, assuming low-level injection and negligible drift:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta n(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Delta n(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n(x,t)}{\\tau}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the minority-carrier diffusion coefficient and $\\tau$ is the minority-carrier lifetime, both assumed to be uniform constants.\n\nThe quantity of interest is the areal stored excess carrier charge density, defined as:\n$$\nQ_A(t) = q \\int_{0}^{L} \\Delta n(x,t) \\, dx\n$$\nIt is convenient to first work with the total number of excess carriers per unit area, $N(t)$:\n$$\nN(t) = \\int_{0}^{L} \\Delta n(x,t) \\, dx \\implies Q_A(t) = q N(t)\n$$\nTo derive an ordinary differential equation for $N(t)$, we integrate the continuity equation over the length of the slab, from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial t} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( D \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Delta n}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n}{\\tau} \\right) \\, dx\n$$\nBy interchanging the order of differentiation and integration on the left side, and distributing the integral on the right side, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{L} \\Delta n(x,t) \\, dx = D \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Delta n}{\\partial x^2} \\, dx - \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{0}^{L} \\Delta n(x,t) \\, dx\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $N(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = D \\left[ \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial x} \\right]_{x=0}^{x=L} - \\frac{N(t)}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a perfectly reflecting boundary at $x=L$, which translates to a zero-flux condition: $\\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial x}\\big|_{x=L} = 0$. Applying this boundary condition simplifies the equation to:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -D \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=0} - \\frac{N(t)}{\\tau}\n$$\nThis is the charge-control equation. The term $F(t) = -D \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial x}\\big|_{x=0}$ represents the flux of minority carriers entering the slab at $x=0$. The equation can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} + \\frac{N(t)}{\\tau} = F(t)\n$$\nTo solve this equation for $N(t)$, we must determine the driving term, $F(t)$. This is where the specified charge-control approximation is invoked. The problem states that the model approximates the spatial profile by the corresponding steady-state shape. This implies that the relationship between the boundary concentration and the boundary gradient (which determines the flux) is assumed to be the same as in steady state. Since the boundary concentration is held at a constant value $\\Delta n(0,t) = \\Delta n_s$ for $t \\geq 0$, the flux $F(t)$ is approximated by its constant, steady-state value, $F_{ss}$.\n\nTo find $F_{ss}$, we must first find the steady-state excess carrier profile, $\\Delta n_{ss}(x)$, by solving the time-independent continuity equation:\n$$\n0 = D \\frac{d^2 \\Delta n_{ss}}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n_{ss}}{\\tau} \\implies \\frac{d^2 \\Delta n_{ss}}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n_{ss}}{L_D^2} = 0\n$$\nwhere $L_D = \\sqrt{D\\tau}$ is the minority-carrier diffusion length. The above equation is a second-order homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation whose general solution is:\n$$\n\\Delta n_{ss}(x) = A \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right) + B \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nThe constants $A$ and $B$ are determined by the steady-state boundary conditions:\n1. $\\Delta n_{ss}(0) = \\Delta n_s$\n2. $\\frac{d\\Delta n_{ss}}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = 0$\n\nFrom the first condition: $\\Delta n_s = A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) \\implies A = \\Delta n_s$.\nTo apply the second condition, we first find the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Delta n_{ss}}{dx} = \\frac{A}{L_D} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right) + \\frac{B}{L_D} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nAt $x=L$:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{\\Delta n_s}{L_D} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) + \\frac{B}{L_D} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) \\implies B = -\\Delta n_s \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nThe steady-state profile is thus:\n$$\n\\Delta n_{ss}(x) = \\Delta n_s \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right) - \\Delta n_s \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nThis can be simplified using the hyperbolic identity $\\cosh(a-b)=\\cosh(a)\\cosh(b)-\\sinh(a)\\sinh(b)$:\n$$\n\\Delta n_{ss}(x) = \\Delta n_s \\frac{\\cosh(L/L_D)\\cosh(x/L_D) - \\sinh(L/L_D)\\sinh(x/L_D)}{\\cosh(L/L_D)} = \\Delta n_s \\frac{\\cosh((L-x)/L_D)}{\\cosh(L/L_D)}\n$$\nNow we compute the steady-state flux $F_{ss}$:\n$$\nF_{ss} = -D \\frac{d\\Delta n_{ss}}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0}\n$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Delta n_{ss}}{dx} = \\frac{\\Delta n_s}{\\cosh(L/L_D)} \\left(-\\frac{1}{L_D}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{L-x}{L_D}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nEvaluating at $x=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Delta n_{ss}}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = -\\frac{\\Delta n_s}{L_D \\cosh(L/L_D)} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta n_s}{L_D} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nTherefore, the steady-state flux is:\n$$\nF_{ss} = -D \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta n_s}{L_D} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{D \\Delta n_s}{L_D} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this constant flux into our charge-control ODE for $t \\geq 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} + \\frac{N(t)}{\\tau} = \\frac{D \\Delta n_s}{L_D} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation. The initial condition is $N(0)=0$, since there are no excess carriers for $t < 0$. The solution is of the form $N(t) = N_h(t) + N_p(t)$, where $N_h(t)$ is the homogeneous solution and $N_p(t)$ is the particular solution.\nThe homogeneous solution is $N_h(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau)$ for some constant $C$.\nThe particular solution for a constant right-hand side is a constant, $N_p$. Substituting into the ODE:\n$$\n0 + \\frac{N_p}{\\tau} = F_{ss} \\implies N_p = \\tau F_{ss}\n$$\nThe general solution is $N(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau) + \\tau F_{ss}$. Applying the initial condition $N(0)=0$:\n$$\n0 = C \\exp(0) + \\tau F_{ss} \\implies C = -\\tau F_{ss}\n$$\nThus, the solution for $N(t)$ is:\n$$\nN(t) = \\tau F_{ss} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_{ss}$ and using $L_D^2 = D\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau F_{ss} = \\tau \\frac{D \\Delta n_s}{L_D} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) = \\frac{\\tau D}{L_D} \\Delta n_s \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) = \\frac{L_D^2}{L_D} \\Delta n_s \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau F_{ss} = L_D \\Delta n_s \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nThis final steady-state value of the total charge is $N_{ss}$.

            "solution": "The objective is to derive the time-dependent gate current $i_{G}(t)$ and the effective input capacitance $C_{in,\\mathrm{eff}}(V_{GS}, V_{DS})$. We begin by formulating an expression for the total gate charge, $Q_{G}(V_{GS}, V_{DS})$.\n\nThe total gate charge $Q_{G}$ is the sum of the charge on the gate electrode mirroring the channel inversion layer, $Q_{G,inv}$, and the charges associated with the gate-to-source and gate-to-drain overlap regions, $Q_{G,ov,gs}$ and $Q_{G,ov,gd}$, respectively.\n$$Q_{G} = Q_{G,inv} + Q_{G,ov,gs} + Q_{G,ov,gd}$$\n\nFirst, let's determine the channel-related charge, $Q_{G,inv}$. Under the gradual-channel approximation in strong inversion, the charge density per unit area on the gate at a position $x$ along the channel is given by:\n$$Q'_{g}(x) = C_{ox} (V_{GC}(x) - V_{T})$$\nwhere $C_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $V_{T}$ is the constant threshold voltage, and $V_{GC}(x)$ is the local potential difference between the gate and the channel. With the source as the reference terminal ($V_S=0$), the gate potential is $V_{G} = V_{GS}$, and the channel potential at position $x$ is $V(x)$. Thus, $V_{GC}(x) = V_{GS} - V(x)$.\n$$Q'_{g}(x) = C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{T})$$\nTo find the total gate charge over the channel, we integrate this density over the area of the gate, which is $W \\times L$. Assuming uniformity in the width direction:\n$$Q_{G,inv} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\int_{0}^{W} Q'_{g}(x) \\, dy \\, dx = W \\int_{0}^{L} C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{T}) \\, dx$$\nThe problem explicitly instructs to use the linear approximation for the channel potential in the triode region:\n$$V(x) \\approx \\frac{V_{DS}}{L} x$$\nThis approximation is physically most accurate for small $V_{DS}$ ($V_{DS} \\ll V_{GS} - V_{T}$), but its use is mandated here for the entire specified operating range.
