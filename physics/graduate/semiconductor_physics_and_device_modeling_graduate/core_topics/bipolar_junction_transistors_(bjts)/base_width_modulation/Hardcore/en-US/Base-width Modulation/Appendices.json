The cross-sectional area is $A$, the intrinsic carrier concentration is $n_i$, the temperature is $T$, and the elementary charge is $q$.

The concepts of minority carrier transport, diffusion current, depletion regions, and base-width modulation (the Early effect) are fundamental principles in this field.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly structured.

It provides all necessary variables and simplifying assumptions (e.g., short-base, 1D transport, low-level injection) that are standard for an idealized analysis. The conditions are internally consistent. The use of temperature $T$ implies that the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ is an available fundamental constant, which is a standard convention.\n- **Other flaws**: The problem does not exhibit any other flaws such as being unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable. The scenario described is a textbook example of the Early effect.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins by determining the minority carrier distribution in the quasi-neutral base. For an $n$-$p$-$n$ BJT, the base is $p$-type, so the minority carriers are electrons. Let $n_p(x)$ be the electron concentration in the base, where the quasi-neutral base region extends from $x=0$ (at the emitter-base depletion edge) to $x=W_B$ (at the collector-base depletion edge).\n\nIn steady-state and under the assumption of negligible recombination, the continuity equation for electrons in the base simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 n_p(x)}{dx^2} = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this differential equation is a linear function:\n$$ n_p(x) = C_1 x + C_2 $$\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by the boundary conditions at the edges of the quasi-neutral base.\n\n1.  At the emitter-base junction ($x=0$), which is forward biased by $V_{BE}$, the law of the junction gives the minority carrier concentration:\n    $$ n_p(0) = n_{p0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{BE}}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n    where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $n_{p0}$ is the equilibrium electron concentration in the $p$-type base. From the mass-action law, $n_{p0} = n_i^2 / N_A$. Since the base acceptor density is given as $N_B$, we have $n_{p0} = n_i^2 / N_B$. This gives $C_2 = n_p(0)$.\n\n2.  At the collector-base junction ($x=W_B$), which is reverse biased, the minority carrier concentration is depleted. The problem states it can be taken as negligible, so:\n    $$ n_p(W_B) \\approx 0 $$\nApplying this to the general solution:\n$$ n_p(W_B) = C_1 W_B + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{C_2}{W_B} = -\\frac{n_p(0)}{W_B} $$\nThus, the minority carrier concentration profile across the quasi-neutral base is a linear (triangular) distribution:\n$$ n_p(x) = n_p(0) \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{W_B}\\right) $$\nThe stored minority carrier charge in the base, $Q_B$, is the integral of the excess minority charge density over the base volume. The excess electron concentration is $n_p'(x) = n_p(x) - n_{p0}$. For a forward-biased junction, typically $V_{BE} > 3k_B T/q$, which makes $n_p(0) \\gg n_{p0}$. Therefore, we can approximate the excess concentration as $n_p'(x) \\approx n_p(x)$.\nThe magnitude of the total stored excess minority charge is:\n$$ Q_B = qA \\int_0^{W_B} n_p'(x) \\,dx \\approx qA \\int_0^{W_B} n_p(0) \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{W_B}\\right) \\,dx $$\n$$ Q_B = qA n_p(0) \\left[x - \\frac{x^2}{2W_B}\\right]_0^{W_B} = qA n_p(0) \\left(W_B - \\frac{W_B^2}{2W_B}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} q A W_B n_p(0) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $n_p(0)$:\n$$ Q_B = \\frac{1}{2} q A W_B \\frac{n_i^2}{N_B} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{BE}}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nWhen the base width changes to $W_B' = 0.9 W_B$, all other parameters ($V_{BE}$, $T$, etc.) remain fixed, so $n_p(0)$ is unchanged. The new stored charge $Q_B'$ is:\n$$ Q_B' = \\frac{1}{2} q A W_B' n_p(0) = \\frac{1}{2} q A (0.9 W_B) n_p(0) = 0.9 Q_B $$\nThe change in the stored base charge is $\\Delta Q_B = Q_B' - Q_B$:\n$$ \\Delta Q_B = 0.9 Q_B - Q_B = -0.1 Q_B $$\nSubstituting the full expression for $Q_B$, we obtain $\\Delta Q_B$ in the required terms:\n$$ \\Delta Q_B = -0.1 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} q A W_B \\frac{n_i^2}{N_B} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{BE}}{k_B T}\\right) \\right) = -0.05 \\, q A W_B \\frac{n_i^2}{N_B} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{BE}}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nNext, we relate this to the collector current, $I_C$. In the short-base limit, the collector current is purely due to the diffusion of minority carriers across the base. The diffusion current density for electrons is given by Fick's law:\n$$ J_n(x) = q D_n \\frac{d n_p(x)}{dx} $$\nwhere $D_n$ is the electron diffusion coefficient in the base. The collector current $I_C$ is the magnitude of this current evaluated over the cross-sectional area $A$. The gradient is constant throughout the base:\n$$ \\frac{dn_p(x)}{dx} = -\\frac{n_p(0)}{W_B} $$\nThe collector current has a magnitude:\n$$ I_C = A |J_n| = A \\left|q D_n \\left(-\\frac{n_p(0)}{W_B}\\right)\\right| = \\frac{A q D_n n_p(0)}{W_B} $$\nThis expression shows that $I_C$ is inversely proportional to the base width $W_B$.\nWhen the base width changes to $W_B'$, the new collector current $I_C'$ is:\n$$ I_C' = \\frac{A q D_n n_p(0)}{W_B'} $$\nThe problem asks for the multiplicative change, which is the ratio $I_C'/I_C$.\n$$ \\frac{I_C'}{I_C} = \\frac{\\frac{A q D_n n_p(0)}{W_B'}}{\\frac{A q D_n n_p(0)}{W_B}} = \\frac{W_B}{W_B'} $$\nGiven that $W_B' = 0.9 W_B$, the ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{I_C'}{I_C} = \\frac{W_B}{0.9 W_B} = \\frac{1}{0.9} = \\frac{10}{9} $$\nThis result shows that a $10\\%$ decrease in base width results in an increase in collector current by a factor of $10/9$.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Collector Current Dependence on $V_{CE}$ and the relationship between $g_o$, $I_C$, and $V_A$**\n\nThe collector current ($I_C$) in an NPN BJT operating in the forward-active region is primarily due to the diffusion of minority carriers (electrons) across the neutral region of the p-type base. Assuming a short, narrow base, the electron concentration profile is approximately linear. The collector current can be expressed as:\n$$I_C = q A_E D_n \\frac{n_p(0) - n_p(W_B)}{W_B}$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $A_E$ is the emitter area, $D_n$ is the electron diffusion coefficient in the base, $W_B$ is the width of the neutral base region, $n_p(0)$ is the electron concentration at the emitter-base junction edge, and $n_p(W_B)$ is the electron concentration at the collector-base junction edge.\n\nIn the forward-active mode, the emitter-base junction is forward-biased and the collector-base junction is reverse-biased. This implies $n_p(0) \\gg n_p(W_B) \\approx 0$. The concentration $n_p(0)$ is determined by the law of the junction and is given by:\n$$n_p(0) = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)$$\nwhere $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration, $N_A$ is the acceptor doping concentration in the base, $V_{BE}$ is the base-emitter voltage, and $V_T = k_B T / q$ is the thermal voltage.\n\nSubstituting this into the current equation, we get:\n$$I_C \\approx \\frac{q A_E D_n n_i^2}{N_A W_B} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)$$\nThis equation shows that for a constant base-emitter voltage $V_{BE}$, the collector current is inversely proportional to the neutral base width, $W_B$:\n$$I_C \\propto \\frac{1}{W_B}$$\nThe neutral base width $W_B$ is not constant. It is the metallurgical base width minus the depletion widths extending into the base from the emitter and collector junctions. The width of the collector-base depletion region, $x_{dC}$, increases as the reverse bias across this junction, $V_{CB}$, increases. As $V_{CE} = V_{CB} + V_{BE}$, for a constant $V_{BE}$, an increase in the collector-emitter voltage $V_{CE}$ directly translates to an increase in $V_{CB}$. This widening of the collector-base depletion region encroaches upon the neutral base, reducing its effective width $W_B$. This phenomenon is known as **base-width modulation** or the **Early effect**.\n\nSince an increase in $V_{CE}$ leads to a decrease in $W_B$, the collector current $I_C$ increases with $V_{CE}$. This gives the output characteristics ($I_C$ vs $V_{CE}$ curves) a finite, positive slope in the active region.\n\nThe Early effect is commonly modeled by extrapolating the linear portion of the $I_C-V_{CE}$ characteristic curve back to the voltage axis. These lines intersect at a point on the negative $V_{CE}$ axis, denoted as $-V_A$, where $V_A$ is the Early voltage. This leads to the first-order model for the collector current:\n$$I_C = I_S \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{V_{CE}}{V_A}\\right)$$\nwhere $I_S$ is the saturation current parameter, which is independent of bias voltages.\n\nThe small-signal output conductance, $g_o$, is defined as the slope of the $I_C-V_{CE}$ curve at a specific operating point (Q-point), for a constant $V_{BE}$:\n$$g_o = \\left.\\frac{\\partial I_C}{\\partial V_{CE}}\\right|_{V_{BE}=\\text{const}}$$\nDifferentiating the model equation for $I_C$ with respect to $V_{CE}$ gives:\n$$g_o = I_S \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\frac{1}{V_A}$$\nLet us define $I_{C0} = I_S \\exp(V_{BE}/V_T)$ as the collector current that would flow if there were no Early effect (i.e., at $V_{CE}=0$). Then the expression for the output conductance becomes:\n$$g_o = \\frac{I_{C0}}{V_A}$$\nThe DC collector current at the operating point $(I_C, V_{CE})$ is given by $I_C = I_{C0}(1 + V_{CE}/V_A)$. For many practical applications, the operating point voltage $V_{CE}$ is much smaller than the Early voltage $V_A$ (typically $V_A > 50\\,\\mathrm{V}$). In this case, we can make the approximation $I_C \\approx I_{C0}$. This allows us to establish the very common and useful first-order relationship:\n$$g_o \\approx \\frac{I_C}{V_A}$$\nThis relationship connects the output conductance, the DC collector current, and the Early voltage at the operating point.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $r_o$ and $V_A$**\n\nThe small-signal output resistance, $r_o$, is the reciprocal of the output conductance, $g_o$.\n$$r_o = \\frac{1}{g_o}$$\nGiven $g_o = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{mS} = 0.05 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}$:\n$$r_o = \\frac{1}{0.05 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}} = 20000\\,\\Omega = 20\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$$\n\nNext, we compute the Early voltage $V_A$ using the relationship derived above, $V_A \\approx I_C / g_o$.\nGiven $I_C = 2\\,\\mathrm{mA} = 2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$ and $g_o = 0.05 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}$:\n$$V_A \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{0.05 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{2}{0.05}\\,\\mathrm{V} = 40\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we have:\n$r_o = 20.00\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$\n$V_A = 40.00\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Discussion on Plausibility**\n\nThe calculated values are $r_o = 20.00\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$ and $V_A = 40.00\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe output resistance $r_o = 20\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$ at a collector current of $I_C = 2\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ is a very typical value for a general-purpose discrete silicon BJT. For example, datasheets for transistors like the 2N3904 or BC547 show output admittances ($h_{oe}$, which is $g_o$) in the range of tens of micro-Siemens for collector currents in the low milliampere range, corresponding to output resistances of tens of kilo-Ohms. Thus, the calculated $r_o$ is physically plausible.\n\nThe Early voltage $V_A = 40\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is also a plausible value. Typical values for $V_A$ in silicon BJTs range from approximately $30\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to over $150\\,\\mathrm{V}$. A value of $40\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is on the lower side of this range, indicating a relatively pronounced Early effect. A stronger Early effect (smaller $V_A$) is characteristic of transistors with a narrow metallurgical base and/or a lightly doped base region. These structural properties allow the collector-base depletion width to modulate the neutral base width more significantly as $V_{CE}$ changes. Such designs are often employed in high-frequency transistors. Therefore, $V_A=40\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is a reasonable, physically consistent value for a silicon small-signal BJT.\n\nIn summary, both calculated parameters fall within the expected range for standard silicon BJT technology.",

The Early effect is modeled by a linear dependence of the collector current $I_C$ on the collector-emitter voltage $V_{CE}$ for a fixed base drive:\n$$I_C(V_{CE}) = I_{C,sat} \\left(1 + \\frac{V_{CE}}{V_A}\\right)$$\nwhere $I_{C,sat}$ is the collector current extrapolated to $V_{CE}=0$.\nGeometrically, the Early voltage $V_A$ is the magnitude of the $V_{CE}$-axis intercept of the tangent to the $I_C$-$V_{CE}$ characteristic curve at a given operating point.\n\nThe task is to perform a \"local tangent analysis near $V_{CE}=3\\,\\mathrm{V}$\". This means we must determine the Early voltage implied by the tangent to each curve at the operating point where $V_{CE}^* = 3\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nLet the operating point be $(V_{CE}^*, I_C^*)$. The slope of the tangent at this point is the output conductance, $g_o = \\left. \\frac{\\partial I_C}{\\partial V_{CE}} \\right|_{V_{CE}^*}$. The equation of the tangent line is:\n$$I_C - I_C^* = g_o (V_{CE} - V_{CE}^*)$$\nSetting $I_C=0$ to find the voltage-axis intercept, $V_{CE,int}$:\n$$0 - I_C^* = g_o (V_{CE,int} - V_{CE}^*)$$\n$$V_{CE,int} = V_{CE}^* - \\frac{I_C^*}{g_o}$$\nThe Early voltage is defined as $V_A = -V_{CE,int}$. Therefore:\n$$V_A = \\frac{I_C^*}{g_o} - V_{CE}^*$$\nWe are given data at discrete points. We can approximate the derivative $g_o$ at $V_{CE}=3\\,\\mathrm{V}$ using a central difference formula with the neighboring points at $V_{CE}=2\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $V_{CE}=4\\,\\mathrm{V}$:\n$$g_o \\approx \\frac{I_C(V_{CE}=4\\,\\mathrm{V}) - I_C(V_{CE}=2\\,\\mathrm{V})}{4\\,\\mathrm{V} - 2\\,\\mathrm{V}}$$\nWe will now calculate $V_A$ for each of the three curves.\n\n**Curve L (low drive):**\n- Operating point at $V_{CE}^*=3\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is $(3\\,\\mathrm{V}, 1.110\\,\\mathrm{mA})$. So, $I_C^* = 1.110\\,\\mathrm{mA}$.\n- Data for slope calculation: $I_C(2\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 1.054\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ and $I_C(4\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 1.170\\,\\mathrm{mA}$.\n- Output conductance $g_{o,L}$:\n$$g_{o,L} \\approx \\frac{1.170\\,\\mathrm{mA} - 1.054\\,\\mathrm{mA}}{4\\,\\mathrm{V} - 2\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{0.116\\,\\mathrm{mA}}{2\\,\\mathrm{V}} = 0.058\\,\\mathrm{mA/V}$$\n- Early voltage $V_{A,L}$:\n$$V_{A,L} = \\frac{1.110\\,\\mathrm{mA}}{0.058\\,\\mathrm{mA/V}} - 3\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 19.138\\,\\mathrm{V} - 3\\,\\mathrm{V} = 16.138\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\n**Curve M (medium drive):**\n- Operating point at $V_{CE}^*=3\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is $(3\\,\\mathrm{V}, 2.340\\,\\mathrm{mA})$. So, $I_C^* = 2.340\\,\\mathrm{mA}$.\n- Data for slope calculation: $I_C(2\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 2.160\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ and $I_C(4\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 2.540\\,\\mathrm{mA}$.\n- Output conductance $g_{o,M}$:\n$$g_{o,M} \\approx \\frac{2.540\\,\\mathrm{mA} - 2.160\\,\\mathrm{mA}}{4\\,\\mathrm{V} - 2\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{0.380\\,\\mathrm{mA}}{2\\,\\mathrm{V}} = 0.190\\,\\mathrm{mA/V}$$\n- Early voltage $V_{A,M}$:\n$$V_{A,M} = \\frac{2.340\\,\\mathrm{mA}}{0.190\\,\\mathrm{mA/V}} - 3\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 12.316\\,\\mathrm{V} - 3\\,\\mathrm{V} = 9.316\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\n**Curve H (high drive):**\n- Operating point at $V_{CE}^*=3\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is $(3\\,\\mathrm{V}, 4.750\\,\\mathrm{mA})$. So, $I_C^* = 4.750\\,\\mathrm{mA}$.\n- Data for slope calculation: $I_C(2\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 4.350\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ and $I_C(4\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 5.200\\,\\mathrm{mA}$.\n- Output conductance $g_{o,H}$:\n$$g_{o,H} \\approx \\frac{5.200\\,\\mathrm{mA} - 4.350\\,\\mathrm{mA}}{4\\,\\mathrm{V} - 2\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{0.850\\,\\mathrm{mA}}{2\\,\\mathrm{V}} = 0.425\\,\\mathrm{mA/V}$$\n- Early voltage $V_{A,H}$:\n$$V_{A,H} = \\frac{4.750\\,\\mathrm{mA}}{0.425\\,\\mathrm{mA/V}} - 3\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 11.176\\,\\mathrm{V} - 3\\,\\mathrm{V} = 8.176\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\n**Analysis of Results:**\nThe calculated Early voltages for the three curves are:\n- $V_{A,L} \\approx 16.1\\,\\mathrm{V}$ at $I_C \\approx 1.1\\,\\mathrm{mA}$\n- $V_{A,M} \\approx 9.3\\,\\mathrm{V}$ at $I_C \\approx 2.3\\,\\mathrm{mA}$\n- $V_{A,H} \\approx 8.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$ at $I_C \\approx 4.75\\,\\mathrm{mA}$\n\nThese values are clearly not constant. To check if they fall within a $10\\%$ tolerance band, we can compute their mean and check the deviation. The mean is $\\bar{V}_A = (16.138 + 9.316 + 8.176)/3 \\approx 11.21\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n- Deviation for Curve L: $|\\frac{16.138 - 11.21}{11.21}| \\times 100\\% \\approx 44\\%$\n- Deviation for Curve M: $|\\frac{9.316 - 11.21}{11.21}| \\times 100\\% \\approx 17\\%$\n- Deviation for Curve H: $|\\frac{8.176 - 11.21}{11.21}| \\times 100\\% \\approx 27\\%$\nAll deviations are significantly larger than the specified $10\\%$ tolerance. Therefore, a single Early voltage cannot represent all three curves.\nFurthermore, the results show a clear trend: as the collector current $I_C$ increases, the calculated Early voltage $V_A$ decreases.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A single Early voltage $V_A$ suffices within $10\\%$ for all three curves.**\nAs demonstrated by the calculations above, the calculated values of $V_A$ are approximately $16.1\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $9.3\\,\\mathrm{V}$, and $8.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The variation among these values is far greater than $10\\%$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. A current-dependent Early voltage $V_A(I_C)$ that decreases with increasing $I_C$ is required to reproduce the observed characteristics.**\nThe analysis shows that as the collector current increases (from low to medium to high drive), the corresponding Early voltage decreases (from $16.1\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to $9.3\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to $8.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$). This statement accurately describes the behavior observed from the data.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. A single $V_A$ suffices if one takes $V_A\\approx 12\\,\\mathrm{V}$; the slight curvature primarily originates from finite emitter resistance.**\nThe first part of the statement, that a single $V_A \\approx 12\\,\\mathrm{V}$ suffices, is false. The deviation of $V_{A,L} \\approx 16.1\\,\\mathrm{V}$ from $12\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is about $34\\%$, which is not within tolerance. The second part of the statement is also physically incorrect. The presence of an emitter resistance $R_E$ introduces negative feedback that *increases* the effective output resistance, making the $I_C$-$V_{CE}$ curves flatter, not more sloped or curved in the manner observed. The data shows concave-up curvature (output conductance increases with $V_{CE}$), whereas emitter degeneration would lead to concave-down curvature.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The curvature is dominated by avalanche multiplication at these $V_{CE}$ values, so $V_A$ is not a meaningful parameter here.**\nThe problem statement explicitly posits that \"avalanche multiplication is negligible\". Therefore, this option contradicts a fundamental premise of the problem.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The dataset is insufficient to distinguish between a constant $V_A$ and a current-dependent $V_A(I_C)$.**\nThe analysis yielded substantially different values for $V_A$ for each current level ($16.1\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $9.3\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $8.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$). The trend is monotonic and the differences are large, well beyond what could be attributed to numerical approximation errors. The dataset is therefore quite sufficient to conclude that $V_A$ is current-dependent.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
