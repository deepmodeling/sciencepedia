It describes a standard textbook problem in analog electronics and device physics. The given values are realistic, and the tasks are well-defined. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Transconductance ($g_m$)**\n\nThe collector current ($I_C$) of a BJT in the forward-active region is predominantly determined by the base-emitter voltage ($V_{BE}$). The fundamental relationship is given by the simplified Ebers-Moll model equation:\n$$\nI_C = I_S \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $I_S$ is the reverse saturation current, a constant for a given transistor that depends on its physical construction (doping levels, junction area) and temperature. $V_{BE}$ is the DC voltage applied across the base-emitter junction. $V_T$ is the thermal voltage, a parameter that depends on temperature and is defined by universal constants:\n$$\nV_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q}\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature in kelvins, and $q$ is the magnitude of the elementary charge.\n\nThe transconductance, $g_m$, is a parameter of the small-signal hybrid-$\\pi$ model. It represents the change in the output collector current for a small change in the input base-emitter voltage, evaluated at a specific DC operating point (also known as the quiescent point). Mathematically, it is defined as the partial derivative of the collector current with respect to the base-emitter voltage, evaluated at the DC bias point $(I_C, V_{BE})$:\n$$\ng_m \\equiv \\left. \\frac{dI_C}{dV_{BE}} \\right|_{I_{C}, V_{BE}}\n$$\nWe can find this derivative by differentiating the expression for $I_C$:\n$$\ng_m = \\frac{d}{dV_{BE}} \\left[ I_S \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation, we get:\n$$\ng_m = I_S \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dV_{BE}}\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) = I_S \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{V_T}\n$$\nThe term $I_S \\exp(V_{BE}/V_T)$ is simply the DC collector current $I_C$ at the bias point. Therefore, we can substitute $I_C$ back into the expression:\n$$\ng_m = \\frac{I_C}{V_T}\n$$\nThis is the expression for $g_m$ in terms of $I_C$ and the thermal voltage $V_T$. To express it in terms of $I_C$, $T$, and the universal constants, we substitute the definition of $V_T$:\n$$\ng_m = \\frac{I_C}{k_B T / q} = \\frac{q I_C}{k_B T}\n$$\nThis final expression relates the transconductance directly to the DC collector bias current, temperature, and fundamental physical constants.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of $g_m$**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $I_C = 2\\,\\mathrm{mA} = 2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$\n- $q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal voltage $V_T$ at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\nV_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\cdot (300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.0258520\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate $g_m$ using the simpler formula $g_m = I_C/V_T$:\n$$\ng_m = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{0.0258520\\,\\mathrm{V}} \\approx 0.0773644\\,\\mathrm{S}\n$$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{S}$ stands for Siemens, which is equivalent to $\\mathrm{A/V}$.

The transconductance $g_m$ is directly proportional to the DC collector current $I_C$. This means doubling the bias current will double the transconductance, which is a key characteristic in amplifier design.\n2.  **Scaling with $T$**: For a fixed DC collector current $I_C$, the transconductance $g_m$ is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature $T$. This indicates that as the temperature of the transistor increases, its transconductance decreases, assuming the bias current is held constant by the external circuit.",

A small-signal voltage $v_b$ is applied to the base, causing a small-signal current $i_b$ to flow in. The input resistance is $R_{in} = v_b/i_b$. The model consists of a resistance $r_\\pi$ between the base and emitter terminals and a voltage-controlled current source $g_m v_{be}$ flowing from the collector to the emitter, where $v_{be}$ is the small-signal voltage across $r_\\pi$. The problem states to neglect the base spreading resistance and the Early effect (output resistance $r_o \\to \\infty$). The emitter is connected to ground via a resistor $R_E$.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the input loop (base-emitter loop):\n$$v_b = v_{be} + v_e$$\nwhere $v_{be}$ is the voltage across $r_\\pi$ and $v_e$ is the voltage across the emitter resistor $R_E$. By Ohm's law, $v_{be} = i_b r_\\pi$. The voltage $v_e$ is given by $v_e = i_e R_E$, where $i_e$ is the small-signal emitter current.\nThe emitter current is the sum of the base and collector currents: $i_e = i_b + i_c$. The collector current is determined by the controlled source: $i_c = g_m v_{be}$. Substituting $v_{be} = i_b r_\\pi$, we get $i_c = g_m (i_b r_\\pi)$. The relationship between $g_m$ and $r_\\pi$ is derived from the definition of the common-emitter current gain, $\\beta = i_c/i_b$.\n$$\\beta = \\frac{g_m (i_b r_\\pi)}{i_b} = g_m r_\\pi \\implies r_\\pi = \\frac{\\beta}{g_m}$$\nUsing this, we can express the emitter current in terms of the base current:\n$$i_e = i_b + i_c = i_b + \\beta i_b = (\\beta+1)i_b$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $i_e$ into the equation for $v_e$:\n$$v_e = (\\beta+1)i_b R_E$$\nFinally, substitute the expressions for $v_{be}$ and $v_e$ back into the KVL equation for $v_b$:\n$$v_b = i_b r_\\pi + (\\beta+1)i_b R_E = i_b (r_\\pi + (\\beta+1)R_E)$$\nThe input resistance, $R_{in}$, seen looking into the base is therefore:\n$$R_{in} = \\frac{v_b}{i_b} = r_\\pi + (\\beta+1)R_E$$\n\n**Derivation using the T-Model**\n\nNext, we use the small-signal T-model. This model consists of a resistor $r_e$ in the emitter lead and a current-controlled current source $\\alpha i_e$ flowing from the collector to the emitter, where $\\alpha$ is the common-base current gain.\n\nA small-signal voltage $v_b$ is applied to the base, and the corresponding current $i_b$ flows into the base. The emitter node is connected to ground through $R_E$. The voltage at the base, $v_b$, is the sum of the voltage drops across the internal emitter resistance $r_e$ and the external emitter resistance $R_E$.\n$$v_b = i_e r_e + i_e R_E = i_e (r_e + R_E)$$\nThe base current $i_b$ is related to the emitter current $i_e$ by:\n$$i_b = i_e - i_c = i_e - \\alpha i_e = (1-\\alpha)i_e$$\nFrom this, we can express $i_e$ in terms of $i_b$:\n$$i_e = \\frac{i_b}{1-\\alpha}$$\nThe internal emitter resistance $r_e$ is related to the transconductance $g_m$ and $\\alpha$ by $r_e = \\alpha/g_m$.\nNow, substitute the expression for $i_e$ into the equation for $v_b$:\n$$v_b = \\frac{i_b}{1-\\alpha} (r_e + R_E)$$\nThe input resistance, $R_{in}$, is then:\n$$R_{in} = \\frac{v_b}{i_b} = \\frac{r_e + R_E}{1-\\alpha}$$\n\n**Analytical Equivalence of the Two Expressions**\n\nWe must show that the expressions derived from the two models are identical, i.e., $r_\\pi + (\\beta+1)R_E = \\frac{r_e + R_E}{1-\\alpha}$. We use the fundamental relationships provided: $\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+1}$ and the derived parameter definitions $r_\\pi = \\beta/g_m$ and $r_e = \\alpha/g_m$.\n\nFirst, let's manipulate the expression for the T-model result. From $\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+1}$, we find an expression for $1-\\alpha$:\n$$1-\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+1} = \\frac{(\\beta+1) - \\beta}{\\beta+1} = \\frac{1}{\\beta+1}$$\nSubstituting this into the T-model expression for $R_{in}$:\n$$R_{in} = \\frac{r_e + R_E}{1/( \\beta+1)} = (\\beta+1)(r_e + R_E) = (\\beta+1)r_e + (\\beta+1)R_E$$\nNow we only need to show that $(\\beta+1)r_e$ is equal to $r_\\pi$. We use the definitions of $r_e$ and $r_\\pi$ in terms of $g_m$:\n$$(\\beta+1)r_e = (\\beta+1)\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{g_m}\\right)$$\nSubstitute $\\alpha = \\beta/(\\beta+1)$:\n$$(\\beta+1)r_e = (\\beta+1)\\left(\\frac{\\beta/(\\beta+1)}{g_m}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta}{g_m}$$\nSince we know that $r_\\pi = \\beta/g_m$, we have proven that $r_\\pi = (\\beta+1)r_e$.\nSubstituting this identity back into the manipulated T-model expression:\n$$R_{in} = (\\beta+1)r_e + (\\beta+1)R_E = r_\\pi + (\\beta+1)R_E$$\nThis is precisely the expression obtained from the hybrid-$\\pi$ model. The two models are therefore analytically consistent.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe will now calculate the numerical value of the input resistance using the formula $R_{in} = r_\\pi + (\\beta+1)R_E$.\nGiven:\n$\\beta = 120$\n$R_E = 20\\,\\Omega$\n$I_C = 10\\,\\mathrm{mA} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n$T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$k_B = 1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$\n$q = 1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nStep 1: Calculate the thermal voltage $V_T$.\n$$V_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649\\times 10^{-23}) \\times 300}{1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 0.0258520\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nStep 2: Calculate the transconductance $g_m$.\n$$g_m = \\frac{I_C}{V_T} = \\frac{0.01\\,\\mathrm{A}}{0.0258520\\,\\mathrm{V}} \\approx 0.386817\\,\\mathrm{S}$$\nStep 3: Calculate the intrinsic base-emitter resistance $r_\\pi$.\n$$r_\\pi = \\frac{\\beta}{g_m} = \\frac{120}{0.386817\\,\\mathrm{S}} \\approx 310.224\\,\\Omega$$\nStep 4: Calculate the total input resistance $R_{in}$.\n$$R_{in} = r_\\pi + (\\beta+1)R_E = 310.224\\,\\Omega + (120+1) \\times 20\\,\\Omega$$\n$$R_{in} = 310.224\\,\\Omega + 121 \\times 20\\,\\Omega = 310.224\\,\\Omega + 2420\\,\\Omega = 2730.224\\,\\Omega$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $2730\\,\\Omega$.",

The angular frequency of the pole, $\\omega_p$, is the magnitude of $s_p$, which corresponds to the $-3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ angular frequency, $\\omega_H$.\n$$ \\omega_H = \\frac{1}{R_{eq} C_{in}} = \\frac{1}{(R_S \\parallel r_{\\pi})(C_{\\pi} + C_{\\mu}(1 - A_v))} $$\nThe $-3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth in Hertz, $f_H$, is given by $f_H = \\omega_H / (2\\pi)$.\n$$ f_H = \\frac{1}{2\\pi (R_S \\parallel r_{\\pi})(C_{\\pi} + C_{\\mu}(1 - A_v))} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$R_{S} = 1 \\times 10^3 \\, \\Omega$\n$r_{\\pi} = 2 \\times 10^3 \\, \\Omega$\n$C_{\\pi} = 30 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{F}$\n$C_{\\mu} = 1 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{F}$\n$A_v = -50$\n\nFirst, calculate the equivalent resistance $R_{eq}$:\n$$ R_S \\parallel r_{\\pi} = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^3)(2 \\times 10^3)}{1 \\times 10^3 + 2 \\times 10^3} \\, \\Omega = \\frac{2 \\times 10^6}{3 \\times 10^3} \\, \\Omega = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 10^3 \\, \\Omega $$\nNext, calculate the total input capacitance $C_{in}$:\n$$ C_{in} = C_{\\pi} + C_{\\mu}(1 - A_v) = 30 \\times 10^{-12} + (1 \\times 10^{-12})(1 - (-50)) $$\n$$ C_{in} = 30 \\times 10^{-12} + (1 \\times 10^{-12})(51) = (30 + 51) \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{F} = 81 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{F} $$\nNow, we can calculate the time constant $\\tau = R_{eq}C_{in}$:\n$$ \\tau = \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 10^3\\right) \\times (81 \\times 10^{-12}) \\, \\mathrm{s} = 2 \\times 27 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{s} = 54 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{s} $$\nFinally, we calculate the $-3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ bandwidth $f_H$:\n$$ f_H = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\tau} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi (54 \\times 10^{-9})} \\, \\mathrm{Hz} = \\frac{10^9}{108\\pi} \\, \\mathrm{Hz} $$\n$$ f_H \\approx \\frac{10^9}{339.292} \\approx 2.9473375 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{Hz} $$\nThe problem asks for the result in $\\mathrm{MHz}$, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ f_H \\approx 2.95 \\, \\mathrm{MHz} $$",
