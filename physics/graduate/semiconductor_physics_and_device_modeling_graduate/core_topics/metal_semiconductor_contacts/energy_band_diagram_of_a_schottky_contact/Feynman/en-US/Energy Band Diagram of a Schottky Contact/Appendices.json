All provided definitions and parameters are standard and physically realistic. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe analysis begins by considering the energy band diagrams of the isolated metal and semiconductor relative to a common reference, the vacuum level ($E_{vac}$).\n\nThe work function of the metal, $\\Phi_M$, is defined as the energy required to move an electron from the metal's Fermi level ($E_{F,M}$) to the vacuum level.\n$$ \\Phi_M = E_{vac} - E_{F,M} $$\n\nThe electron affinity of the semiconductor, $\\chi$, is the energy required to move an electron from the bottom of the conduction band ($E_C$) to the vacuum level.\n$$ \\chi = E_{vac} - E_C $$\n\nThe bandgap of the semiconductor, $E_g$, is the energy difference between the conduction band minimum ($E_C$) and the valence band maximum ($E_V$).\n$$ E_g = E_C - E_V $$\n\nWhen the metal and semiconductor are brought into contact, charge transfer occurs until the Fermi levels align, establishing a single Fermi level $E_F$ throughout the system at thermal equilibrium.\n$$ E_F = E_{F,M} = E_{F,S} $$\nwhere $E_{F,S}$ is the Fermi level in the semiconductor bulk. This alignment causes band bending in the semiconductor near the interface.\n\nThe electron Schottky barrier height, $\\Phi_{Bn}$, is defined as the energy difference between the conduction band minimum at the interface, $E_C(\\text{interface})$, and the common Fermi level, $E_F$.\n$$ \\Phi_{Bn} = E_C(\\text{interface}) - E_F $$\n\nIn the ideal Schottky-Mott model (also called the electron affinity rule), it is assumed that the electron affinity $\\chi$ is constant up to the interface. This implies that the energy difference between the vacuum level and the conduction band edge is unaffected by the contact formation. Thus, we can write:\n$$ E_C(\\text{interface}) = E_{vac}(\\text{interface}) - \\chi $$\nwhere $E_{vac}(\\text{interface})$ is the vacuum level at the interface.\n\nSince the Fermi level is constant across the junction, $E_F = E_{F,M}$. From the definition of the work function, the metal Fermi level is located at an energy $\\Phi_M$ below the vacuum level just outside the metal surface. In the ideal model with no interface dipoles, this relationship holds at the interface:\n$$ E_F = E_{vac}(\\text{interface}) - \\Phi_M $$\n\nSubstituting these expressions for $E_C(\\text{interface})$ and $E_F$ into the definition of $\\Phi_{Bn}$:\n$$ \\Phi_{Bn} = (E_{vac}(\\text{interface}) - \\chi) - (E_{vac}(\\text{interface}) - \\Phi_M) $$\n$$ \\Phi_{Bn} = \\Phi_M - \\chi $$\nThis is the ideal expression for the electron Schottky barrier height.\n\nThe hole Schottky barrier height, $\\Phi_{Bp}$, is defined as the energy difference between the Fermi level, $E_F$, and the valence band maximum at the interface, $E_V(\\text{interface})$. This represents the energy barrier for holes crossing from the metal into the semiconductor valence band.\n$$ \\Phi_{Bp} = E_F - E_V(\\text{interface}) $$\n\nThe bandgap $E_g$ is an intrinsic property of the semiconductor material, so the relation $E_g = E_C - E_V$ holds everywhere, including at the interface:\n$$ E_V(\\text{interface}) = E_C(\\text{interface}) - E_g $$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Phi_{Bp}$:\n$$ \\Phi_{Bp} = E_F - (E_C(\\text{interface}) - E_g) = E_g - (E_C(\\text{interface}) - E_F) $$\n\nRecognizing that $E_C(\\text{interface}) - E_F$ is the definition of $\\Phi_{Bn}$, we find a fundamental relationship between the two barrier heights and the bandgap:\n$$ \\Phi_{Bp} = E_g - \\Phi_{Bn} $$\nThis shows that the sum of the electron and hole barrier heights in an ideal contact is equal to the semiconductor bandgap: $\\Phi_{Bn} + \\Phi_{Bp} = E_g$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the numerical values for the given parameters: $\\Phi_M = 4.8\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\chi = 4.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, and $E_g = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. All values are given in electron-volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$), so the results will also be in $\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nThe electron barrier height is:\n$$ \\Phi_{Bn} = \\Phi_M - \\chi = 4.8\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 4.05\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.75\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\n\nThe hole barrier height is:\n$$ \\Phi_{Bp} = E_g - \\Phi_{Bn} = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.75\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.37\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\n\nTo determine which carrier injection is favored, we compare the magnitudes of the two barrier heights. The transport of charge carriers over a potential barrier is governed by thermionic emission, where the current is exponentially dependent on the negative of the barrier height.

Therefore, this metal-semiconductor combination favors hole injection. This contact would form a rectifying (Schottky) contact on n-type silicon but would tend towards being an ohmic contact on p-type silicon due to the low hole barrier.\n\nThe final numerical answers for the barrier heights are $\\Phi_{Bn} = 0.75\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\Phi_{Bp} = 0.37\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.",

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and assumptions (e.g., complete ionization, ideal interface) to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Derivation of the Built-in Potential $V_{bi}$**\n\nThe built-in electrostatic potential, $V_{bi}$, across the space-charge region (or depletion region) of the Schottky contact is the difference between the electrostatic potential in the neutral semiconductor bulk, $V(\\infty)$, and the potential at the metal-semiconductor interface, $V(0)$.\n$$V_{bi} = V(\\infty) - V(0)$$\nThe potential energy of an electron is related to the electrostatic potential $V$ by $E = -eV$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. The conduction band edge energy, $E_C(x)$, varies with position $x$ according to the local potential: $E_C(x) = E_{C,0} - eV(x)$, where $E_{C,0}$ is a constant reference energy.\n\nThe total band bending in the semiconductor is the difference between the conduction band edge energy at the interface ($x=0$) and in the bulk ($x \\to \\infty$). For an $n$-type semiconductor with a sufficiently high metal work function, the bands bend upwards, so $E_C(0)  E_C(\\infty)$. The band bending energy is:\n$$E_C(0) - E_C(\\infty) = (E_{C,0} - eV(0)) - (E_{C,0} - eV(\\infty)) = e(V(\\infty) - V(0))$$\nThis gives the fundamental relationship between band bending and the built-in potential:\n$$eV_{bi} = E_C(0) - E_C(\\infty)$$\nTo derive $V_{bi}$ in terms of the given parameters, we can express the right-hand side by introducing the constant Fermi level $E_F$:\n$$eV_{bi} = (E_C(0) - E_F) - (E_C(\\infty) - E_F)$$\nThe first term, $(E_C(0) - E_F)$, is the energy difference between the conduction band edge at the interface and the Fermi level. The problem statement defines this as the electron Schottky barrier height, $\\Phi_{Bn}$.\n$$(E_C(0) - E_F) = \\Phi_{Bn}$$\nThe second term, $(E_C(\\infty) - E_F)$, is the energy difference between the conduction band edge and the Fermi level in the neutral bulk of the semiconductor. We can find this from the given expression for the electron concentration, $n_0$:\n$$n_0 = N_C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C(\\infty) - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe problem specifies a nondegenerate semiconductor with complete ionization of donors. Therefore, the electron concentration in the neutral bulk, $n_0$, is equal to the donor concentration, $N_D$.\n$$n_0 = N_D$$\nSubstituting this into the concentration equation gives:\n$$N_D = N_C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C(\\infty) - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nSolving for the energy difference $(E_C(\\infty) - E_F)$:\n$$\\frac{N_D}{N_C} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C(\\infty) - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_D}{N_C}\\right) = -\\frac{E_C(\\infty) - E_F}{k_B T}$$\n$$E_C(\\infty) - E_F = -k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_D}{N_C}\\right) = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_C}{N_D}\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the expressions for both terms back into the equation for $eV_{bi}$:\n$$eV_{bi} = \\Phi_{Bn} - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_C}{N_D}\\right)$$\nDividing by the elementary charge $e$, we arrive at the expression for the built-in potential $V_{bi}$ in terms of the specified parameters:\n$$V_{bi} = \\frac{\\Phi_{Bn}}{e} - \\frac{k_B T}{e} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_C}{N_D}\\right)$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\Phi_{Bn} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $N_C = 2.8 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- $N_D = 5 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nThe term $\\frac{\\Phi_{Bn}}{e}$ is simply the numerical value of the barrier height in volts:\n$$\\frac{\\Phi_{Bn}}{e} = \\frac{0.8\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{e} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe term $\\frac{k_B T}{e}$ is the thermal voltage, $V_T$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for three components: a derivation, a numerical calculation, and a physical interpretation regarding the ideality factor of a Schottky contact. We will address each in sequence after validating the problem statement.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of semiconductor device physics, specifically the thermionic emission theory of Schottky barriers. The question, while leading to a counter-intuitive result ($n  1$), probes a known, albeit anomalous, phenomenon discussed in the scientific literature. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary definitions and data for the derivation and calculation. It is well-posed, objective, and non-trivial.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between the ideality factor $n$ and the measured semi-logarithmic slope $S_{10}$. The current density $J$ for a Schottky diode under forward bias $V$ (where $V \\gg k_B T / q$) and dominated by thermionic emission is described by the equation:\n$$\nJ = J_s \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{n k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $J_s$ is the reverse saturation current density, $q$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $n$ is the ideality factor.\n\nTo find the relationship between $V$ and $\\log_{10} J$, we first take the natural logarithm of the equation:\n$$\n\\ln J = \\ln J_s + \\frac{qV}{n k_B T}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to express $V$ as a function of $\\ln J$:\n$$\nV = \\frac{n k_B T}{q} (\\ln J - \\ln J_s)\n$$\nThe problem defines the slope $S_{10}$ using the base-10 logarithm. We use the change of base formula for logarithms, $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$, to express $V$ in terms of $\\log_{10} J$:\n$$\nV = \\frac{n k_B T}{q} (\\ln(10) \\log_{10} J - \\ln J_s)\n$$\nNow, we can find the slope $S_{10}$ by differentiating $V$ with respect to $\\log_{10} J$. The term $\\ln J_s$ is a constant with respect to the applied voltage $V$ in the simplest model.\n$$\nS_{10} \\equiv \\frac{dV}{d(\\log_{10} J)} = \\frac{d}{d(\\log_{10} J)} \\left[ \\frac{n k_B T \\ln(10)}{q} \\log_{10} J - \\frac{n k_B T}{q} \\ln J_s \\right]\n$$\nThis gives:\n$$\nS_{10} = \\frac{n k_B T \\ln(10)}{q}\n$$\nThis expression relates the ideality factor $n$ to the measured slope $S_{10}$. To find $n$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\nn = \\frac{q S_{10}}{k_B T \\ln(10)}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nSecond, we compute the numerical value of $n$ using the given data:\n- $S_{10} = 0.045\\,\\mathrm{V/decade}$\n- $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $q = 1.602\\,176\\,634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- $k_B = 1.380\\,649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$\n\nWe can first calculate the thermal voltage, $V_{th} = k_B T / q$:\n$$\nV_{th} = \\frac{(1.380\\,649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) (300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.602\\,176\\,634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.025\\,852\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe ideal slope for $n=1$ would be $S_{10,\\text{ideal}} = V_{th} \\ln(10)$:\n$$\nS_{10,\\text{ideal}} \\approx (0.025\\,852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times \\ln(10) \\approx 0.059\\,516\\,\\mathrm{V/decade}\n$$\nThe ideality factor $n$ is the ratio of the measured slope to the ideal slope:\n$$\nn = \\frac{S_{10}}{V_{th} \\ln(10)} = \\frac{0.045\\,\\mathrm{V/decade}}{0.059\\,516\\,\\mathrm{V/decade}} \\approx 0.75609...\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\nn \\approx 0.756\n$$\n\nThird, we must identify a microscopic interfacial mechanism that could account for an ideality factor $n  1$. An ideality factor deviating from unity indicates that the barrier height is effectively bias-dependent. The ideality factor can be generally defined as $n^{-1} = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\frac{d(\\ln J)}{dV}$. If the current is of the form $J \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV - q\\Phi_B(V)}{k_B T}\\right)$, where $\\Phi_B(V)$ is the bias-dependent effective barrier height, then:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\frac{d}{dV}\\left[\\frac{qV - q\\Phi_B(V)}{k_B T}\\right] = 1 - \\frac{d\\Phi_B(V)}{dV}\n$$\nThis gives the relation $n = \\frac{1}{1 - d\\Phi_B/dV}$. For $n  1$, we must have $1/n  1$, which implies $1 - d\\Phi_B/dV  1$, leading to the condition $d\\Phi_B/dV  0$. This means the effective barrier height must *decrease* with increasing forward bias.\n\nStandard image-force lowering, mentioned in the problem, results in $n1$. This is because in forward bias, the electric field at the junction *decreases* with increasing voltage $V$. The magnitude of the image-force barrier lowering is proportional to the square root of the electric field. Thus, as $V$ increases, the barrier lowering effect is reduced, and the effective barrier height $\\Phi_B(V)$ actually *increases* ($d\\Phi_B/dV  0$), resulting in $n  1$.\n\nTherefore, another mechanism must be responsible. The most widely accepted explanation for an anomalous ideality factor $n  1$ is the presence of **barrier height inhomogeneity**. This model posits that the metal-semiconductor interface is not uniform but consists of microscopic patches with different Schottky barrier heights. At low temperatures and low forward biases, current transport is dominated by charge carriers flowing through the patches with the lowest barrier heights. As the forward bias increases, the voltage distribution across the interface becomes more complex. The potential at low-barrier patches becomes more strongly influenced by the surrounding high-barrier regions, leading to a non-linear voltage dependence of the current. This can cause the total current to increase with voltage more rapidly than predicted by the standard thermionic emission model for a uniform barrier, resulting in a measured (apparent) ideality factor of less than unity in certain bias and temperature regimes. This is a complex effect, but it is considered the most natural physical mechanism to explain the observation of $n  1$ within the framework of interfacial electrostatics. Other less common explanations involve specific distributions of interface states that change their charge occupancy with bias in such a way as to lower the barrier.",
