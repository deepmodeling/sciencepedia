            "problem": "A metal–semiconductor Schottky contact is formed between a metal and uniformly doped n-type Silicon (Si). Under zero applied bias, assume a one-dimensional planar geometry, the depletion approximation in the semiconductor (immobile ionized donors only within the space-charge region, negligible mobile carriers), complete screening in the metal so the electric field inside the metal is zero, negligible image-force barrier lowering, and negligible interface states. The built-in potential across the depleted semiconductor at equilibrium is $V_{bi}$, the donor concentration is $N_D$, and the semiconductor permittivity is $\\varepsilon_s$. Starting from Gauss’s law and Poisson’s equation of electrostatics, apply appropriate boundary conditions to derive an expression for the zero-bias depletion width $W_0$ in terms of $\\varepsilon_s$, $V_{bi}$, $q$, and $N_D$.

            "solution": "The problem is to derive an expression for the zero-bias depletion width, $W_0$, of a metal-semiconductor Schottky contact and then to calculate its numerical value for a given set of parameters. The derivation starts from Poisson's equation of electrostatics under the depletion approximation.\n\nLet the metal-semiconductor interface be at the position $x=0$, with the n-type semiconductor occupying the region $x>0$. Under the depletion approximation, for zero applied bias, a space-charge region of width $W_0$ forms in the semiconductor. In this region, from $x=0$ to $x=W_0$, mobile carriers (electrons) are assumed to be fully depleted, leaving behind a uniform positive charge density of ionized donors, $\\rho(x) = qN_D$, where $q$ is the elementary charge and $N_D$ is the donor concentration. For $x>W_0$, the semiconductor is assumed to be electrically neutral, so the charge density $\\rho(x)=0$.\n\nPoisson's equation in one dimension relates the electrostatic potential $V(x)$ to the charge density $\\rho(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_s} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_s$ is the permittivity of the semiconductor.\n\nIn the depletion region ($0 \\le x \\le W_0$), this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -\\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon_s} $$\n\nThe electric field $\\mathcal{E}(x)$ is the negative gradient of the potential, $\\mathcal{E}(x) = -\\frac{dV}{dx}$. Integrating Poisson's equation once with respect to $x$ gives the electric field profile:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dx} = -\\int \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon_s} dx = -\\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon_s}x + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is an integration constant. So, the electric field is $\\mathcal{E}(x) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon_s}x - C_1$.\n\nA boundary condition is that the electric field must vanish at the edge of the depletion region, $x=W_0$, as the region beyond is neutral. Thus, $\\mathcal{E}(W_0)=0$.\n$$ \\mathcal{E}(W_0) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon_s}W_0 - C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon_s}W_0 $$\nSubstituting $C_1$ back into the expression for the electric field, we get:\n$$ \\mathcal{E}(x) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon_s}(x - W_0) \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le W_0 $$\nNote that the field is negative throughout the depletion region, pointing from the positive space charge in the semiconductor towards the negative charge induced on the metal surface.\n\nThe built-in potential, $V_{bi}$, is the total potential difference across the depletion region at equilibrium. It is the potential of the neutral semiconductor bulk relative to the potential at the interface. We can find this by integrating the electric field from the interface ($x=0$) to the edge of the depletion region ($x=W_0$):\n$$ V_{bi} = V(W_0) - V(0) = -\\int_0^{W_0} \\mathcal{E}(x) dx $$\n$$ V_{bi} = -\\int_0^{W_0} \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon_s}(x - W_0) dx $$\n$$ V_{bi} = -\\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} - W_0x \\right]_0^{W_0} $$\n$$ V_{bi} = -\\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{W_0^2}{2} - W_0^2\\right) - (0) \\right] $$\n$$ V_{bi} = -\\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left( -\\frac{W_0^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{qN_D W_0^2}{2\\varepsilon_s} $$\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for the zero-bias depletion width $W_0$ gives the desired expression:\n$$ W_0^2 = \\frac{2\\varepsilon_s V_{bi}}{qN_D} $$\n$$ W_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_s V_{bi}}{qN_D}} $$\n\nNow, a numerical evaluation of $W_0$ is required. The given parameters must first be converted to SI units.\nThe elementary charge is $q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$.\nThe vacuum permittivity is $\\varepsilon_0 = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$.\nThe silicon permittivity is $\\varepsilon_s = 11.7\\,\\varepsilon_0 = 11.7 \\times (8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}) \\approx 1.03594 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$.\nThe built-in potential is $V_{bi} = 0.7\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\nThe donor concentration is $N_D = 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.

Tunneling is negligible.\n2.  **Thermionic-Field Emission (TFE):** $E_{00} \\approx k_B T$. Electrons are thermally excited to an energy level from which they can tunnel through the narrowed barrier.\n3.  **Field Emission (FE):** $E_{00} \\gg k_B T$. The barrier is so thin (due to high doping) that electrons tunnel through near the Fermi level. Thermal excitation is not the dominant process.\n\nIn this case, we have calculated $E_{00} / (k_B T) \\approx 3.59$. This corresponds to the condition $E_{00} > k_B T$. Since the tunneling energy scale is significantly greater than the thermal energy scale, carrier transport is not dominated by thermal energy but by the electric field facilitating tunneling. Therefore, the dominant transport mechanism is **field emission (FE)**. The high doping level enhances the field at the junction, thinning the barrier and making field emission the primary conduction path, especially at the low temperature of $77\\,\\mathrm{K}$ where thermal energy is suppressed.",
