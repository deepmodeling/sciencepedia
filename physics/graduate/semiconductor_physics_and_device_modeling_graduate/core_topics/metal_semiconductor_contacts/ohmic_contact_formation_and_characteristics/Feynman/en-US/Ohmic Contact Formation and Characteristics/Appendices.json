The function $\\coth(z)$ for $z>0$ is a monotonically decreasing function that is always greater than $1$. Therefore, $R_c'(L)$ approaches its asymptotic value from above. The condition is:\n$$ R_c'(L_{\\mathrm{min}}) = (1 + 0.02) R'_{c, \\text{asympt}} = 1.02 \\ R_s L_T $$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_c'(L_{\\mathrm{min}})$:\n$$ R_s L_T \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{min}}}{L_T}\\right) = 1.02 \\ R_s L_T $$\n$$ \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{min}}}{L_T}\\right) = 1.02 $$\nWe solve for the argument by taking the inverse hyperbolic cotangent:\n$$ \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{min}}}{L_T} = \\mathrm{arccoth}(1.02) $$\nUsing the logarithmic definition of the inverse hyperbolic cotangent, $\\mathrm{arccoth}(z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{z+1}{z-1}\\right)$:\n$$ \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{min}}}{L_T} = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1.02+1}{1.02-1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{2.02}{0.02}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(101) $$\nSo, the minimum length is:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{min}} = L_T \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(101) \\right) $$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nFirst, we calculate the transfer length $L_T$ using the given material parameters: $R_s = 150\\ \\Omega/\\square$ (the unit is effectively $\\Omega$) and $\\rho_c = 3.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\Omega \\cdot \\text{m}^2$.\n$$ L_T = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c}{R_s}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\Omega \\cdot \\text{m}^2}{150\\ \\Omega}} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{m}^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m} $$\nNow we calculate $L_{\\mathrm{min}}$:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\left(\\sqrt{2} \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(101)\\right) $$\nUsing a calculator:\n$$ \\ln(101) \\approx 4.6151205 $$\n$$ \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4142136 $$\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx (1.4142136 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}) \\times \\left(\\frac{4.6151205}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx (1.4142136 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}) \\times 2.30756025 $$\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx 3.2633306 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m} $$\nThe answer is required in micrometers, so $L_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx 3.2633306\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $3.263\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.",
