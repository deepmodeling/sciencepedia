The source is at $x=0$ and the drain is at $x=L$. The channel potential at position $x$ is denoted by $V(x)$, with boundary conditions $V(0)=0$ and $V(L)=V_{DS}$.\n\nThe drift current $I_D$ flowing through this differential segment is constant along the channel due to current continuity. It can be expressed as the product of the channel width $W$, the mobile inversion charge per unit area $|Q_i(x)|$, and the electron drift velocity $v_d(x)$:\n$$I_D = W |Q_i(x)| v_d(x)$$\nUnder the assumption of constant low-field mobility $\\mu_n$, the drift velocity is proportional to the longitudinal electric field $E_x(x)$:\n$$v_d(x) = \\mu_n E_x(x)$$\nThe electric field is the negative gradient of the channel potential, which under the Gradual Channel Approximation (GCA) is given by $E_x(x) = \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$. We consider the magnitude of the current, so we can write:\n$$I_D = W \\mu_n |Q_i(x)| \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$$\nNext, we express the inversion charge density $|Q_i(x)|$. According to the charge-sheet model, the gate voltage controls the charge in the semiconductor. The potential difference across the oxide at position $x$ is $V_{GS} - V(x)$. The mobile inversion charge is formed when this local gate-to-channel potential exceeds the threshold voltage $V_T$. The charge density is given by:\n$$|Q_i(x)| = C_{\\text{ox}} [V_{GS} - V(x) - V_T]$$\nThis expression is valid as long as $V_{GS} - V(x) > V_T$, which defines the strong inversion condition along the channel.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $|Q_i(x)|$ into the current equation yields:\n$$I_D = W \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} [V_{GS} - V_T - V(x)] \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$$\nTo find the total current, we separate variables and integrate along the length of the channel.

We can identify two components:\n1.  The full quadratic expression, denoted $I_{D,\\text{quad}}$:\n    $$I_{D,\\text{quad}} = \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} \\left( (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right)$$\n2.  The linearized expression, $I_{D,\\text{lin}}$, obtained by neglecting the quadratic term $-\\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2$. This approximation is accurate for very small $V_{DS}$ ($V_{DS} \\ll 2(V_{GS}-V_T)$):\n    $$I_{D,\\text{lin}} = \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS}$$\nThe term $-\\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2$ is the quadratic correction. It accounts for the reduction in channel charge density near the drain due to the non-zero drain voltage, causing the I-V curve to bend downwards as $V_{DS}$ increases.\n\nFirst, we calculate the device transconductance parameter, $\\beta$:\n$$\\beta = \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} = (0.03~\\text{m}^{2}\\!\\cdot\\!\\text{V}^{-1}\\!\\cdot\\!\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (6.9 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{F}\\!\\cdot\\!\\text{m}^{-2}) \\times \\frac{10 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{m}}$$\n$$\\beta = (2.07 \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{A}\\!\\cdot\\!\\text{V}^{-2}) \\times 10 = 2.07 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{A}\\!\\cdot\\!\\text{V}^{-2}$$\nThe overdrive voltage is $V_{OV} = V_{GS} - V_T = 0.8~\\text{V} - 0.4~\\text{V} = 0.4~\\text{V}$.\nThe saturation voltage is $V_{DS,sat} = V_{OV} = 0.4~\\text{V}$.

The channel potential at position $x$ is $V(x)$, which varies from $V(0)=0$ to $V(L)=V_{DS}$.\n\n1.  **Drift Current:** The drain current, $I_D$, is driven by the drift of electrons in the channel. For an n-channel MOSFET, the conventional current $I_D$ flows from drain to source, and it is constant along the channel under quasi-static conditions. The current can be expressed in terms of the inversion charge density and the electron drift velocity:\n    $$I_D = W |Q_i(x)| v_n(x)$$\n    where $W$ is the channel width, $Q_i(x)$ is the inversion charge density per unit area at position $x$, and $v_n(x)$ is the magnitude of the electron drift velocity. The velocity is related to the lateral electric field $E_x(x)$ by the mobility $\\mu_n$:\n    $$v_n(x) = \\mu_n E_x(x) = \\mu_n \\left| -\\frac{dV(x)}{dx} \\right| = \\mu_n \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$$\n    since $V(x)$ increases from source to drain.\n\n2.  **Inversion Charge:** The inversion charge density is controlled by the gate-to-channel voltage, $V_{GC}(x) = V_{GS} - V(x)$. Using the gradual-channel approximation, the magnitude of the inversion charge per unit area is given by:\n    $$|Q_i(x)| = C_{ox}(V_{GC}(x) - V_T) = C_{ox}(V_{GS} - V_T - V(x))$$\n    where $C_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $C_{ox} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}$.

This occurs when the inversion charge density at the drain becomes zero:\n$$|Q_i(L)| = C_{ox}(V_{GS} - V_T - V(L)) \\to 0$$\nSince $V(L) = V_{DS}$, the condition for the onset of saturation is:\n$$V_{GS} - V_T - V_{DS} = 0$$\nThis defines the saturation drain-to-source voltage, $V_{DS,sat}$:\n$$V_{DS,sat} = V_{GS} - V_T$$\nFor $V_{DS} > V_{DS,sat}$, the simple model assumes the current saturates and becomes independent of $V_{DS}$.\n\n### Task 2: Calculation of the On-Current ($I_{on}$)\n\nThe on-current, $I_{on}$, is defined as the drain current at the onset of saturation, $I_{D,sat} = I_D(V_{DS} = V_{DS,sat})$.

First, calculate $C_{ox}$:\n$$\\varepsilon_{ox} = 3.9 \\times \\varepsilon_{0} = 3.9 \\times 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F/m} = 3.45313324863 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{F/m}$$\n$$C_{ox} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} = \\frac{3.45313324863 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{F/m}}{5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}} = 6.90626649726 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{F/m}^2$$\nNext, convert the mobility $\\mu_n$ to SI units:\n$$\\mu_n = 475\\ \\frac{\\text{cm}^2}{\\text{V}\\cdot\\text{s}} = 475 \\times (10^{-2}\\ \\text{m})^2 \\frac{1}{\\text{V}\\cdot\\text{s}} = 475 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\frac{\\text{m}^2}{\\text{V}\\cdot\\text{s}} = 0.0475\\ \\frac{\\text{m}^2}{\\text{V}\\cdot\\text{s}}$$\nThe geometric ratio is:\n$$\\frac{W}{L} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}} = 20$$\nThe overdrive voltage is:\n$$V_{GS} - V_T = 1.0\\ \\text{V} - 0.3\\ \\text{V} = 0.7\\ \\text{V}$$\nNow, we compute $I_{on}$:\n$$I_{on} = \\frac{1}{2} (0.0475) (6.90626649726 \\times 10^{-3}) (20) (0.7)^2$$\n$$I_{on} = \\frac{1}{2} (0.0475) (6.90626649726 \\times 10^{-3}) (20) (0.49)$$\n$$I_{on} = (0.5 \\times 0.0475 \\times 20 \\times 0.49) \\times (6.90626649726 \\times 10^{-3})$$\n$$I_{on} = (0.23275) \\times (6.90626649726 \\times 10^{-3})$$\n$$I_{on} = 1.60743347587815 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{A}$$\n\n### Task 3: Continuity Check at Saturation Onset\n\nThe third task is to evaluate the difference $\\Delta I = I_{D,\\text{sat}} - I_{D,\\text{lin}}(V_{DS} = V_{DS,\\text{sat}})$.\n\nThe saturation current, $I_{D,sat}$, is *defined* by the value of the linear-region current expression at the specific voltage $V_{DS} = V_{DS,sat}$. As was demonstrated algebraically in Task 2, substituting $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_T$ into the linear region formula\n$$I_{D,\\text{lin}}(V_{DS}) = \\frac{\\mu_n C_{ox} W}{L} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right]$$\nyields the saturation current formula\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2$$\nBy this very definition, the two quantities are identical:\n$$I_{D,\\text{lin}}(V_{DS} = V_{DS,sat}) \\equiv I_{D,sat}$$\nThis is a fundamental feature of the continuous, first-order long-channel MOSFET model. Therefore, the difference is exactly zero:\n$$\\Delta I = I_{D,sat} - I_{D,sat} = 0$$\nThis confirms the model's continuity at the transition point between the linear and saturation regions.",
