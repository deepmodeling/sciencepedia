The source is at $x=0$ and the drain is at $x=L$. The channel potential at position $x$ is denoted by $V(x)$, with boundary conditions $V(0)=0$ and $V(L)=V_{DS}$.\n\nThe drift current $I_D$ flowing through this differential segment is constant along the channel due to current continuity. It can be expressed as the product of the channel width $W$, the mobile inversion charge per unit area $|Q_{\\text{inv}}(x)|$, and the electron drift velocity $v_d(x)$:\n$$I_D = W |Q_{\\text{inv}}(x)| v_d(x)$$\nUnder the assumption of constant low-field mobility $\\mu_n$, the drift velocity is proportional to the longitudinal electric field $E_x(x)$:\n$$v_d(x) = \\mu_n E_x(x)$$\nThe electric field is the negative gradient of the channel potential, which under the Gradual Channel Approximation (GCA) is given by $E_x(x) = \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$. We consider the magnitude of the current, so we can write:\n$$I_D = W \\mu_n |Q_{\\text{inv}}(x)| \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$$\nNext, we express the inversion charge density $|Q_{\\text{inv}}(x)|$. According to the charge-sheet model, the gate voltage controls the charge in the semiconductor. The potential difference across the oxide at position $x$ is $V_{GS} - V(x)$. The mobile inversion charge is formed when this local gate-to-channel potential exceeds the threshold voltage $V_T$. The charge density is given by:\n$$|Q_{\\text{inv}}(x)| = C_{\\text{ox}} [V_{GS} - V(x) - V_T]$$\nThis expression is valid as long as $V_{GS} - V(x) > V_T$, which defines the strong inversion condition along the channel.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $|Q_{\\text{inv}}(x)|$ into the current equation yields:\n$$I_D = W \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} [V_{GS} - V_T - V(x)] \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$$\nTo find the total current, we separate variables and integrate along the length of the channel.

The linearized expression, $I_{D,\\text{lin}}$, obtained by neglecting the quadratic term $-\\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2$. This approximation is accurate for very small $V_{DS}$ ($V_{DS} \\ll 2(V_{GS}-V_T)$):\n    $$I_{D,\\text{lin}} = \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS}$$\nThe term $-\\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2$ is the quadratic correction. It accounts for the reduction in channel charge density near the drain due to the non-zero drain voltage, causing the I-V curve to bend downwards as $V_{DS}$ increases.\n\nFirst, we calculate the device transconductance parameter, $\\beta$:\n$$\\beta = \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} = (0.03~\\text{m}^{2}\\!\\cdot\\!\\text{V}^{-1}\\!\\cdot\\!\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (6.9 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{F}\\!\\cdot\\!\\text{m}^{-2}) \\times \\frac{10 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{m}}$$\n$$\\beta = (2.07 \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{A}\\!\\cdot\\!\\text{V}^{-2}) \\times 10 = 2.07 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{A}\\!\\cdot\\!\\text{V}^{-2}$$\nThe overdrive voltage is $V_{OV} = V_{GS} - V_T = 0.8~\\text{V} - 0.4~\\text{V} = 0.4~\\text{V}$.\nThe saturation voltage is $V_{DS,sat} = V_{OV} = 0.4~\\text{V}$.

This second capacitor has the permittivity of silicon, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}$, and a thickness of $x_c$. Its capacitance per unit area is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{si}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}}{x_c}$$\nThe total effective capacitance per unit area, $C_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, from the gate to the charge centroid is the series combination of $C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{si}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{si}}} = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + \\frac{x_c}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\left( \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + \\frac{x_c}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}} \\right)^{-1}$$\nThe inversion charge is now given by:\n$$Q_i(x) = -C_{\\mathrm{eff}} [V_G - V_T - V(x)]$$\nThe derivation for the drain current $I_{D,\\mathrm{centroid}}$ proceeds exactly as in Model 1, but with $C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ replaced by $C_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$I_{D,\\mathrm{centroid}} = \\frac{W}{L} \\mu C_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\left[ (V_G - V_T)V_D - \\frac{1}{2}V_D^2 \\right]$$\n\n**Fractional Error Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional error in the drain current caused by using the simpler model:\n$$\\text{Fractional Error} = \\frac{I_{D,\\mathrm{neglect}} - I_{D,\\mathrm{centroid}}}{I_{D,\\mathrm{centroid}}}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for the currents:\n$$\\text{Fractional Error} = \\frac{\\frac{W}{L} \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\left[ (V_G - V_T)V_D - \\frac{1}{2}V_D^2 \\right] - \\frac{W}{L} \\mu C_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\left[ (V_G - V_T)V_D - \\frac{1}{2}V_D^2 \\right]}{\\frac{W}{L} \\mu C_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\left[ (V_G - V_T)V_D - \\frac{1}{2}V_D^2 \\right]}$$\nThe common factor $\\frac{W}{L} \\mu \\left[ (V_G - V_T)V_D - \\frac{1}{2}V_D^2 \\right]$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, provided the device is on ($I_D > 0$), which it is. This simplifies the error to a function of the capacitances alone:\n$$\\text{Fractional Error} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ox}} - C_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{C_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{C_{\\mathrm{eff}}} - 1$$\nWe can express the ratio $\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{C_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$ using the series capacitance relation:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{C_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\left( \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right) = C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\left( \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{si}}} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{C_{\\mathrm{si}}}$$\nTherefore, the fractional error simplifies to:\n$$\\text{Fractional Error} = \\left( 1 + \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{C_{\\mathrm{si}}} \\right) - 1 = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{C_{\\mathrm{si}}}$$\nNow we substitute the definitions of $C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{si}}$:\n$$\\text{Fractional Error} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}/t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}/x_c} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}} \\frac{x_c}{t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 3.9\\,\\varepsilon_0$\n- $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} = 11.7\\,\\varepsilon_0$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n- $x_c = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for the fractional error:\n$$\\text{Fractional Error} = \\frac{3.9\\,\\varepsilon_0}{11.7\\,\\varepsilon_0} \\times \\frac{1.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{1.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{3.9}{11.7} \\times 1$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\text{Fractional Error} = \\frac{1}{3} = 0.333333...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get $0.3333$. This positive error indicates that neglecting the inversion layer thickness overestimates the drain current by approximately $33.33\\%$.",
