A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for a multi-part derivation and calculation related to the body effect in a MOSFET.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Threshold Voltage Shift $\\Delta V_{T}(V_{SB})$**\nWe start with the one-dimensional Poisson's equation for the potential $\\psi(x)$ in the p-type semiconductor substrate, where $x$ is the distance from the silicon-oxide interface. Under the depletion approximation, for a depletion width $W$, the space-charge density $\\rho(x)$ is given by $\\rho(x) = -qN_{A}$ for $0 \\le x \\le W$ and $\\rho(x)=0$ for $x > W$.\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_s} = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le W\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_s = \\varepsilon_{s,r}\\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of silicon.\n\nWe integrate this equation once to find the electric field $E(x) = -d\\psi/dx$. The boundary condition is that the electric field vanishes at the edge of the depletion region, $E(W)=0$.\n$$\nE(x) = E(W) + \\int_x^W \\frac{dE}{dx'} dx' = 0 - \\int_x^W \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx'^2} dx' = -\\int_x^W \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} dx' = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s}(W-x)\n$$\nIntegrating again gives the potential $\\psi(x)$. The potential difference across the depletion region is the total band bending. At threshold, the band bending required for strong inversion is $2\\phi_F$. A substrate bias $V_{SB} \\ge 0$ reverse-biases the source-body junction (and thus the channel-body junction), adding to the potential that must be supported by the depletion region. Therefore, the total potential drop across the depletion region is $2\\phi_F + V_{SB}$. Setting the potential in the neutral bulk ($x \\ge W$) to $0$, the surface potential becomes $\\psi(0) = 2\\phi_F + V_{SB}$.\n$$\n\\psi(0) = \\psi(W) - \\int_0^W E(x) dx = 0 - \\int_0^W \\left(-\\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s}(W-x)\\right) dx = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left[Wx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right]_0^W = \\frac{qN_A W^2}{2\\varepsilon_s}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for the surface potential drop gives the depletion width $W$:\n$$\n2\\phi_F + V_{SB} = \\frac{qN_A W^2}{2\\varepsilon_s} \\implies W = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_s (2\\phi_F + V_{SB})}{qN_A}}\n$$\nThe total charge per unit area in the depletion region is $Q_B = -qN_A W$:\n$$\nQ_B = -qN_A \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_s (2\\phi_F + V_{SB})}{qN_A}} = -\\sqrt{2q\\varepsilon_s N_A(2\\phi_F + V_{SB})}\n$$\nThe threshold voltage $V_T$ is given by the voltage balance equation: $V_T = V_{FB} + 2\\phi_F - Q_B/C_{ox}$, where $V_{FB}$ is the flat-band voltage and $C_{ox} = \\varepsilon_{ox}/t_{ox} = \\varepsilon_{ox,r}\\varepsilon_0/t_{ox}$ is the oxide capacitance per unit area.\n$$\nV_T(V_{SB}) = V_{FB} + 2\\phi_F + \\frac{\\sqrt{2q\\varepsilon_s N_A(2\\phi_F + V_{SB})}}{C_{ox}}\n$$\nFor zero substrate bias ($V_{SB}=0$), the threshold voltage is:\n$$\nV_T(0) = V_{FB} + 2\\phi_F + \\frac{\\sqrt{2q\\varepsilon_s N_A(2\\phi_F)}}{C_{ox}}\n$$\nThe shift in threshold voltage, $\\Delta V_T(V_{SB})$, is the difference $V_T(V_{SB}) - V_T(0)$:\n$$\n\\Delta V_T(V_{SB}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2q\\varepsilon_s N_A}}{C_{ox}} \\left( \\sqrt{2\\phi_F + V_{SB}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_F} \\right)\n$$\nDefining the body-effect coefficient $\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{2q\\varepsilon_s N_A}}{C_{ox}}$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta V_T(V_{SB}) = \\gamma \\left( \\sqrt{2\\phi_F + V_{SB}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_F} \\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Linearization for small $V_{SB}$**\nTo find the first-order approximation for small $V_{SB}$, we factor out $\\sqrt{2\\phi_F}$ and perform a Taylor expansion.\n$$\n\\Delta V_T(V_{SB}) = \\gamma \\sqrt{2\\phi_F} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{V_{SB}}{2\\phi_F}} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nFor small $x$, the Taylor series for $\\sqrt{1+x}$ is $1 + \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \\dots$. Let $x = V_{SB}/(2\\phi_F)$. For $V_{SB} \\ll 2\\phi_F$, we can use the first-order approximation $\\sqrt{1+x} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x$.\n$$\n\\Delta V_T(V_{SB}) \\approx \\gamma \\sqrt{2\\phi_F} \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{V_{SB}}{2\\phi_F}\\right) - 1 \\right) = \\gamma \\sqrt{2\\phi_F} \\left( \\frac{V_{SB}}{4\\phi_F} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$\n\\Delta V_T(V_{SB}) \\approx \\gamma \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{\\phi_F}}{4\\phi_F} V_{SB} = \\gamma \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4\\sqrt{\\phi_F}} V_{SB} = \\gamma \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{\\phi_F}} V_{SB} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\sqrt{2\\phi_F}} V_{SB}\n$$\nThis demonstrates the required linearized form.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the condition on $V_{SB}$ for a given relative error $\\delta$**\nThe relative error $\\delta$ is defined with respect to the exact value:\n$$\n\\delta = \\left| \\frac{\\Delta V_{T,approx} - \\Delta V_{T,exact}}{\\Delta V_{T,exact}} \\right|\n$$\nThe Taylor expansion shows that the first-order approximation is an overestimate ($\\sqrt{1+x}  1+x/2$ for $x>0$), so we can drop the absolute value.\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{\\Delta V_{T,approx}}{\\Delta V_{T,exact}} - 1 \\implies \\frac{\\Delta V_{T,approx}}{\\Delta V_{T,exact}} = 1+\\delta\n$$\nWe substitute the expressions for the approximate and exact shifts:\n$$\n\\frac{\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\sqrt{2\\phi_F}} V_{SB}}{\\gamma \\left( \\sqrt{2\\phi_F + V_{SB}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_F} \\right)} = 1+\\delta\n$$\nThe term $\\gamma$ cancels.

Substituting into the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\phi_F(u^2-1)}{4\\phi_F(u-1)} = 1+\\delta\n$$\nFor $V_{SB} > 0$, we have $u > 1$, so $u-1 \\neq 0$.

You measure the drain current $I_D(V_{GS};V_{DS},V_{SB})$ and the transconductance $g_m(V_{GS};V_{DS},V_{SB})$ at a small drain-to-source voltage $V_{DS}$, for several substrate biases $V_{SB} \\ge 0$. The substrate bias modifies the threshold voltage $V_T(V_{SB})$ through the body effect, and it also alters the vertical electric field in the channel which changes the effective mobility $\\mu$ via surface-scattering and Coulomb-scattering mechanisms. Assume the device is operated in the linear regime with $V_{DS} \\ll (V_{GS}-V_T)$ and no significant short-channel effects.\n\nStarting from the drift–diffusion description and the long-channel approximation that the channel current in the linear regime is driven by the inversion charge and the lateral electric field, and recognizing that the mobility experiences field-dependent degradation captured by a factor such as $\\mu(V_{GS},V_{SB}) = \\mu_0 / \\left(1+\\theta\\, (V_{GS}-V_T(V_{SB}))\\right)$ with $\\theta > 0$ representing vertical-field mobility reduction, you want to extract $V_T(V_{SB})$ from the measured data in a way that minimizes ambiguities induced by the mobility changes with $V_{SB}$.\n\nWhich of the following transconductance-based extrapolation methods most robustly yields $V_T(V_{SB})$ from the small-$V_{DS}$ data, and why does it reduce mobility-induced ambiguities compared to directly extrapolating the linear-region $I_D$–$V_{GS}$ characteristics under varying $V_{SB}$?\n\nA. For each $V_{SB}$, compute $Y(V_{GS}) \\equiv I_D(V_{GS})/\\sqrt{g_m(V_{GS})}$ at fixed small $V_{DS}$, plot $Y$ versus $V_{GS}$ in moderate inversion, and take the $V_{GS}$-axis intercept as $V_T(V_{SB})$. The mobility-degradation factor cancels between $I_D$ and $g_m$ so that $Y$ is proportional to $(V_{GS}-V_T)$ independent of the specific $\\mu$ reduction, making the threshold extraction insensitive to changes in $\\mu$ with $V_{SB}$.\n\nB. For each $V_{SB}$, bias the device in saturation ($V_{DS}$ large) and plot $\\sqrt{I_D}$ versus $V_{GS}$, using the $V_{GS}$-axis intercept as $V_T(V_{SB})$.

A solution will be derived by analyzing the provided options based on the given physical model.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe starting point is the drain current $I_D$ for a long-channel MOSFET operating in the linear regime. The current is given by the product of the inversion charge density, the effective mobility, the channel geometry, and the lateral electric field ($V_{DS}/L$).\nFor a small $V_{DS} \\ll (V_{GS}-V_T)$, the drain current is accurately approximated by:\n$$I_D \\approx \\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS}-V_T) V_{DS}$$\nThe problem states that the mobility $\\mu$ is field-dependent, given by the model:\n$$\\mu(V_{GS},V_{SB}) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T(V_{SB}))}$$\nSubstituting this expression for mobility into the drain current equation yields:\n$$I_D(V_{GS}) \\approx \\frac{\\mu_0}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS}-V_T) V_{DS}$$\nFor a fixed $V_{SB}$ and fixed small $V_{DS}$, we can group the constants. Let $\\beta_0 = \\mu_0 C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} V_{DS}$. Note that $\\mu_0$ and $\\theta$ may depend on $V_{SB}$, which is the source of the ambiguity we wish to eliminate. The threshold voltage $V_T$ is also a function of $V_{SB}$. For a fixed $V_{SB}$ measurement:\n$$I_D = \\frac{\\beta_0 (V_{GS}-V_T)}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)}$$\nThe transconductance, $g_m$, is the derivative of $I_D$ with respect to $V_{GS}$:\n$$g_m = \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}}$$\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation:\n$$g_m = \\frac{\\beta_0(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)) - \\beta_0(V_{GS}-V_T)\\theta}{(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))^2}$$\n$$g_m = \\frac{\\beta_0 + \\beta_0\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T) - \\beta_0\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)}{(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))^2}$$\n$$g_m = \\frac{\\beta_0}{(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))^2}$$\nThese expressions for $I_D$ and $g_m$ form the basis for evaluating each option.\n\n**Analysis of the reference method (direct $I_D-V_{GS}$ extrapolation):**\nIf mobility were constant ($\\theta = 0$), then $I_D = \\beta_0(V_{GS}-V_T)$, a linear relationship. The $V_{GS}$-axis intercept would be exactly $V_T$. However, with mobility degradation ($\\theta > 0$), the $I_D-V_{GS}$ curve is sub-linear. A linear extrapolation from a segment of this curve will yield an incorrect value for $V_T$. Since the mobility parameters ($\\mu_0$, $\\theta$) may change with $V_{SB}$, the magnitude of this error will also change with $V_{SB}$, compromising the extraction of the true $V_T(V_{SB})$ relationship.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For each $V_{SB}$, compute $Y(V_{GS}) \\equiv I_D(V_{GS})/\\sqrt{g_m(V_{GS})}$ at fixed small $V_{DS}$, plot $Y$ versus $V_{GS}$ in moderate inversion, and take the $V_{GS}$-axis intercept as $V_T(V_{SB})$.**\n\nLet us construct the function $Y(V_{GS})$:\n$$Y = \\frac{I_D}{\\sqrt{g_m}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\beta_0 (V_{GS}-V_T)}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta_0}{(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))^2}}}$$\n$$Y = \\frac{\\frac{\\beta_0 (V_{GS}-V_T)}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{\\beta_0}}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)}}$$\n$$Y = \\frac{\\beta_0 (V_{GS}-V_T)}{\\sqrt{\\beta_0}} = \\sqrt{\\beta_0} (V_{GS}-V_T)$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\beta_0$:\n$$Y(V_{GS}) = \\sqrt{\\mu_0 C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} V_{DS}} (V_{GS}-V_T)$$\nThis equation shows that $Y$ is a perfectly linear function of $V_{GS}$. The $V_{GS}$-axis intercept of this line (where $Y=0$) is precisely $V_{GS} = V_T$. Importantly, the mobility degradation parameter $\\theta$ has been completely eliminated from the expression for $Y$. The low-field mobility $\\mu_0$ remains only in the slope of the line, $\\sqrt{\\beta_0}$. Therefore, even if $\\mu_0$ and $\\theta$ change with $V_{SB}$, the linearity of the $Y-V_{GS}$ plot is preserved for each $V_{SB}$, and its intercept accurately gives $V_T(V_{SB})$. This method is highly robust against mobility degradation effects and their variation with substrate bias. The claims in this option are fully supported by this derivation.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. For each $V_{SB}$, bias the device in saturation ($V_{DS}$ large) and plot $\\sqrt{I_D}$ versus $V_{GS}$, using the $V_{GS}$-axis intercept as $V_T(V_{SB})$.**\n\nThis method is invalid for two primary reasons. First, the problem explicitly states that the available data are measured \"at a small drain-to-source voltage $V_{DS}$\" in the \"linear regime\". This option requires data from the saturation regime, which contradicts the problem's premise. Second, the physical claim is flawed. In saturation, with mobility degradation, the current is approximately $I_D \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS}-V_T)^2$. Using the given mobility model, $\\sqrt{I_D}$ is proportional to $\\frac{V_{GS}-V_T}{\\sqrt{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)}}$. This is not a linear function of $V_{GS}$. Therefore, a linear extrapolation would be inaccurate, and the method is not \"immune to mobility variations\" as claimed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. For each $V_{SB}$, plot $g_m$ versus $V_{GS}$ at fixed small $V_{DS}$ and extrapolate the linear fit of $g_m(V_{GS})$ down to zero $g_m$ to obtain $V_T(V_{SB})$.**\n\nOur derived expression for transconductance in the linear regime is $g_m = \\frac{\\beta_0}{(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))^2}$. This function is not linear in $V_{GS}$. It is a decreasing function of $V_{GS}$ for $V_{GS} > V_T$. Thus, performing a linear fit to this curve is not justified. Furthermore, the claim that \"the influence of mobility is removed\" is false. The expression for $g_m$ clearly depends on both mobility parameters $\\mu_0$ (via $\\beta_0$) and $\\theta$. The method of extrapolating $g_m$ to find $V_T$ is typically applied in the saturation region for an ideal transistor (where $g_m$ is linear with $V_{GS}$), not the linear region.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. For each $V_{SB}$, calculate $Z(V_{GS}) \\equiv 2 I_D(V_{GS})/g_m(V_{GS})$ in the linear regime and take the $V_{GS}$-axis intercept of a linear fit of $Z(V_{GS})$ as $V_T(V_{SB})$.**\n\nLet us construct the function $Z(V_{GS})$:\n$$Z = \\frac{2I_D}{g_m} = \\frac{2 \\left( \\frac{\\beta_0 (V_{GS}-V_T)}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{\\beta_0}{(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))^2} \\right)}$$\n$$Z = 2(V_{GS}-V_T)(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))$$\n$$Z(V_{GS}) = 2(V_{GS}-V_T) + 2\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)^2$$\nThis function $Z$ is a quadratic function of $(V_{GS}-V_T)$, not a linear one. While the low-field mobility parameter $\\mu_0$ (from $\\beta_0$) has cancelled out, the mobility degradation parameter $\\theta$ remains. Therefore, the claim that \"$Z$ is independent of $\\mu$\" is an oversimplification and not entirely true, as it still depends on the degradation aspect of mobility. A linear fit to a parabola is an approximation, and the resulting intercept would depend on the chosen fitting range and the value of $\\theta$. This method is not as robust as method A, which yields a truly linear relationship from which to extract $V_T$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn conclusion, the method described in option A, known as the Y-function method, is the most robust because it transforms the measured $I_D$ and $g_m$ data into a function $Y(V_{GS})$ that is perfectly linear with $V_{GS}$. The intercept of this line directly yields $V_T$, and this result is independent of the first-order mobility degradation parameter $\\theta$ and the low-field mobility $\\mu_0$, thus minimizing ambiguities arising from their dependence on $V_{SB}$.",

            "problem": "A Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is characterized in the linear region to extract the threshold voltage dependence on substrate bias, denoted $V_{T}(V_{SB})$. The measurement uses externally applied voltages $V_{G}$, $V_{D}$, $V_{S}$, and $V_{B}$, and records the steady-state drain current $I_{D}$ for small external drain-to-source bias. The device exhibits finite ohmic series resistances $R_{D}$ and $R_{S}$ between the external drain and source terminals and the intrinsic channel drain and source nodes, respectively. Assume the following:\n\n- $I_{D}$ is defined positive flowing from drain to source through the intrinsic channel.\n- The series resistances $R_{D}$ and $R_{S}$ are linear (ohmic) and carry the same $I_{D}$ that flows through the intrinsic channel.\n- The gate current and bulk current are negligible, and temperature is uniform.\n- The linear-region conduction of the intrinsic channel is determined by the intrinsic node voltages, not the external terminal voltages.\n\nDefine the externally measured drain-to-source bias as $V_{DS}^{\\text{meas}} \\equiv V_{D} - V_{S}$, and the intrinsic channel drain-to-source bias as $V_{DS}^{\\text{int}} \\equiv V_{D,\\text{int}} - V_{S,\\text{int}}$, where $V_{D,\\text{int}}$ and $V_{S,\\text{int}}$ are the drain and source potentials at the intrinsic channel ends.\n\nStarting from Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) applied along the drain path and the source path, and the stated sign conventions, derive an explicit closed-form expression for $V_{DS}^{\\text{int}}$ in terms of $V_{DS}^{\\text{meas}}$, $I_{D}$, $R_{D}$, and $R_{S}$. Express your final answer as a single analytic expression. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is formally validated and found to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in semiconductor device physics that requires the application of fundamental circuit laws.\n\nThe objective is to derive an explicit closed-form expression for the intrinsic drain-to-source voltage, $V_{DS}^{\\text{int}}$, in a MOSFET model that includes ohmic series resistances at the drain and source terminals. The derivation will be based on Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) and the definitions provided.\n\nThe system consists of the intrinsic MOSFET channel connected to the external world through a drain series resistance, $R_{D}$, and a source series resistance, $R_{S}$. The externally applied voltages are $V_{D}$ and $V_{S}$ at the drain and source terminals, respectively. The potentials at the ends of the intrinsic channel are $V_{D,\\text{int}}$ and $V_{S,\\text{int}}$. The drain current, $I_{D}$, is defined as positive flowing from the drain to the source. This implies that the same current $I_{D}$ flows sequentially through the drain resistance $R_{D}$, the intrinsic channel, and the source resistance $R_{S}$.\n\nAccording to Ohm's law, a current flowing through a resistor results in a voltage drop, where the potential decreases in the direction of the current flow. We will apply this principle along with KVL.\n\nFirst, consider the path from the external drain terminal to the intrinsic drain node. The current $I_{D}$ flows from the external terminal (potential $V_{D}$) through the resistor $R_{D}$ to the intrinsic node (potential $V_{D,\\text{int}}$). Therefore, the potential $V_{D}$ must be higher than $V_{D,\\text{int}}$. The voltage drop across $R_{D}$ is given by:\n$$V_{D} - V_{D,\\text{int}} = I_{D} R_{D}$$\nFrom this equation, we can express the intrinsic drain potential in terms of the external drain potential and the voltage drop across $R_{D}$:\n$$V_{D,\\text{int}} = V_{D} - I_{D} R_{D}$$\n\nNext, consider the path from the intrinsic source node to the external source terminal. The current $I_{D}$ flows from the intrinsic source node (potential $V_{S,\\text{int}}$) through the resistor $R_{S}$ to the external terminal (potential $V_{S}$). Therefore, the potential $V_{S,\\text{int}}$ must be higher than $V_{S}$. The voltage drop across $R_{S}$ is given by:\n$$V_{S,\\text{int}} - V_{S} = I_{D} R_{S}$$\nFrom this equation, we can express the intrinsic source potential in terms of the external source potential and the voltage drop across $R_{S}$:\n$$V_{S,\\text{int}} = V_{S} + I_{D} R_{S}$$\n\nThe problem requires us to find the intrinsic drain-to-source bias, which is defined as:\n$$V_{DS}^{\\text{int}} \\equiv V_{D,\\text{int}} - V_{S,\\text{int}}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the expressions for $V_{D,\\text{int}}$ and $V_{S,\\text{int}}$ into this definition:\n$$V_{DS}^{\\text{int}} = (V_{D} - I_{D} R_{D}) - (V_{S} + I_{D} R_{S})$$\n\nTo simplify, we group the terms involving the external voltages and the terms involving the current and resistances:\n$$V_{DS}^{\\text{int}} = (V_{D} - V_{S}) - I_{D} R_{D} - I_{D} R_{S}$$\nFactoring out the current $I_{D}$ from the resistance terms yields:\n$$V_{DS}^{\\text{int}} = (V_{D} - V_{S}) - I_{D}(R_{D} + R_{S})$$\n\nFinally, we use the definition provided for the externally measured drain-to-source bias, $V_{DS}^{\\text{meas}} \\equiv V_{D} - V_{S}$. Substituting this into our expression gives the final result:\n$$V_{DS}^{\\text{int}} = V_{DS}^{\\text{meas}} - I_{D}(R_{D} + R_{S})$$\n\nThis expression correctly shows that the intrinsic voltage across the channel is the externally applied voltage reduced by the total ohmic voltage drop across the series resistances. This relationship is fundamental for accurately extracting intrinsic device parameters from external measurements.",
