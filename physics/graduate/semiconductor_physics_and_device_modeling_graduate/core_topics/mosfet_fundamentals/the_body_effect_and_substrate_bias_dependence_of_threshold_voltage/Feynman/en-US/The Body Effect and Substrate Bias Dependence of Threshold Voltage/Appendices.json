All terms used—Fermi potential, oxide capacitance, depletion approximation, body effect, threshold voltage, and band bending—are fundamental concepts in semiconductor device physics.

The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for the correct combination of a sign convention, the functional dependence of the threshold voltage, and the state of band bending at threshold. These are well-defined physical quantities that can be derived from first principles. The problem is structured to have a unique, physically correct answer among the choices. It is well-posed.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The language is precise, technical, and free of any subjective or ambiguous statements. All parameters are clearly defined. The problem is objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a standard, well-posed problem in semiconductor device physics. I will now proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Detailed Solution\n\nThe problem requires a comprehensive understanding of the operation of a p-channel MOSFET, specifically the body effect. We must analyze three distinct aspects: the sign convention for the source-to-body voltage, the change in threshold voltage magnitude with this bias, and the corresponding change in band bending at the semiconductor surface.\n\n#### 1. Sign Convention for Source-to-Body Voltage ($V_{SB}$)\n\n-   The device is a PMOSFET, meaning its source and drain are p-type regions formed in an n-type substrate (body).\n-   The junction between the p-type source and the n-type body is a p-n diode.\n-   For proper transistor operation, this source-body diode (and the drain-body diode) must not be forward-biased. This means it must be either at zero bias or reverse-biased.\n-   The problem specifies the condition for reverse bias: the potential of the body is higher than the potential of the source, i.e., $V_B > V_S$.\n-   The question provides two possible definitions for $V_{SB}$: $V_{SB} = V_S - V_B$ and $V_{SB} = V_B - V_S$.\n-   Let's analyze the first definition, $V_{SB} = V_S - V_B$. Given the reverse bias condition $V_B > V_S$, it follows that $V_S - V_B < 0$. So, under this convention, $V_{SB}$ is a negative quantity for reverse bias.\n-   Let's analyze the second definition, $V_{SB} = V_B - V_S$. Given the reverse bias condition $V_B > V_S$, it follows that $V_B - V_S > 0$. Under this convention, $V_{SB}$ is a positive quantity for reverse bias.\n-   Both conventions are used in the literature, but a particular option must use one convention consistently. The question requires choosing the option with a physically consistent set of statements.\n\n#### 2. Dependence of Threshold Voltage ($V_{TP}$) on Substrate Bias\n\nThe threshold voltage of a MOSFET is the gate voltage required to form an inversion layer. For a PMOS, $V_{TP}$ is negative. The body effect describes how $V_{TP}$ changes when a reverse bias is applied to the source-body junction.\n\n-   The general equation for the PMOS threshold voltage is $V_{TP} = V_{FB} + 2\\phi_F - \\frac{Q'_{dep}}{C_{ox}}$. In this equation, $V_{FB}$ is the flat-band voltage, $\\phi_F$ is the negative Fermi potential of the n-type substrate, and $Q'_{dep}$ is the positive depletion charge per unit area in the substrate.\n-   The depletion charge is given by $Q'_{dep} = \\sqrt{2 q \\epsilon_s N_D (-\\psi_{s,b})}$, where $\\psi_{s,b}$ is the surface potential relative to the bulk (body).\n-   At threshold, the condition for strong inversion must be met. With an applied source-body reverse bias ($V_B > V_S$), the quasi-Fermi levels for electrons (in the body) and holes (in the channel, originating from the source) are separated by $q(V_B - V_S)$. The condition for strong inversion requires a larger band bending. The surface potential relative to the body at threshold becomes $\\psi_{s,b} = 2\\phi_F + (V_S - V_B)$.\n-   Using the problem's notation where $\\phi_F = -|\\phi_F|$ and defining a reverse bias voltage $V_{BS} = V_B - V_S > 0$, the surface potential is $\\psi_{s,b} = -2|\\phi_F| - V_{BS}$.\n-   The term $-\\psi_{s,b}$ under the square root in the depletion charge expression becomes $2|\\phi_F| + V_{BS}$.\n-   The depletion charge at threshold is $Q'_{dep,th} = \\sqrt{2 q \\epsilon_s N_D (2|\\phi_F| + V_{BS})}$.\n-   Substituting this into the $V_{TP}$ equation:\n    $V_{TP} = V_{FB} - 2|\\phi_F| - \\frac{\\sqrt{2 q \\epsilon_s N_D (2|\\phi_F| + V_{BS})}}{C_{ox}}$\n-   Let's define the body effect coefficient for the PMOS as $\\gamma_p = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 q \\epsilon_s N_D}}{C_{ox}}$.\n    $V_{TP} = V_{FB} - 2|\\phi_F| - \\gamma_p \\sqrt{2|\\phi_F| + V_{BS}}$\n-   The zero-bias threshold voltage ($V_{BS}=0$) is $V_{TP0} = V_{FB} - 2|\\phi_F| - \\gamma_p \\sqrt{2|\\phi_F|}$.\n-   Thus, the change in threshold voltage is:\n    $V_{TP}(V_{BS}) - V_{TP0} = -\\gamma_p \\left(\\sqrt{2|\\phi_F| + V_{BS}} - \\sqrt{2|\\phi_F|}\\right)$.\n-   Since $V_{TP}$ and $V_{TP0}$ are negative, their magnitudes are $|V_{TP}| = -V_{TP}$ and $|V_{TP0}| = -V_{TP0}$.\n-   Taking the magnitude of the equation:\n    $-|V_{TP}| = -|V_{TP0}| - \\gamma_p \\left(\\sqrt{2|\\phi_F| + V_{BS}} - \\sqrt{2|\\phi_F|}\\right)$\n    $|V_{TP}| = |V_{TP0}| + \\gamma_p \\left(\\sqrt{2|\\phi_F| + V_{BS}} - \\sqrt{2|\\phi_F|}\\right)$.\n-   This equation shows that the magnitude of the threshold voltage, $|V_{TP}|$, *increases* as the reverse bias $V_{BS}$ increases. This is the physical signature of the body effect.\n\n#### 3. Band Bending at the Surface\n\n-   The relationship between electrostatic potential $\\psi$ and electron energy bands (like $E_C, E_i, E_V$) is $\\Delta E = -q \\Delta \\psi$. An increase in potential corresponds to a downward shift in the energy band diagram.\n-   For a PMOS on an n-type substrate, inversion requires attracting holes to the surface. This is achieved by applying a negative gate voltage, which makes the surface potential $\\psi_s$ lower than the bulk potential $\\psi_{bulk}$. A lower potential means the energy bands bend *upward* at the surface.\n-   From our derivation above, the surface potential relative to the body at threshold is $\\psi_{s,b} = -2|\\phi_F| - V_{BS}$.\n-   At zero bias ($V_{BS}=0$), the surface-to-body potential is $\\psi_{s,b,0} = -2|\\phi_F|$.\n-   With reverse bias ($V_{BS}>0$), the surface-to-body potential is $\\psi_{s,b} = -2|\\phi_F| - V_{BS}$.\n-   The change in surface-to-body potential due to the bias is $\\Delta \\psi_{s,b} = \\psi_{s,b} - \\psi_{s,b,0} = -V_{BS}$.\n-   The corresponding change in the energy band levels at the surface is $\\Delta E = -q \\Delta \\psi_{s,b} = -q(-V_{BS}) = +q V_{BS}$.\n-   A positive change in energy means the bands at the surface move to a higher energy, which corresponds to an *additional upward bending* of the bands. The magnitude of this additional energy bending is $qV_{BS}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under reverse bias of the source-to-body junction, $V_{SB} = V_S - V_B$ is negative. The threshold magnitude increases with $|V_{SB}|$ according to $|V_{TP}(V_{SB})| = |V_{TP0}| + \\gamma_p\\!\\left(\\sqrt{2|\\phi_F| + |V_{SB}|} - \\sqrt{2|\\phi_F|}\\right)$, where $\\gamma_p = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 q \\epsilon_s N_D}}{C_{ox}}$. At threshold, the surface potential relative to the source is $\\psi_s - V_{SB} = -2|\\phi_F|$, so $\\psi_s = -\\!\\left(2|\\phi_F| + |V_{SB}|\\right)$, meaning the bands at the surface bend upward by an additional $q|V_{SB}|$ compared to zero-bias, consistent with increased depletion.**\n\n-   **Sign Convention**: If $V_{SB} = V_S - V_B$, then for reverse bias ($V_B > V_S$), $V_{SB}$ is indeed negative. Correct.\n-   **Threshold Voltage**: The equation uses $|V_{SB}|$. Since $V_{SB}$ from this convention is negative, $|V_{SB}| = -(V_S - V_B) = V_B - V_S = V_{BS}$. The formula $|V_{TP}| = |V_{TP0}| + \\gamma_p(\\sqrt{2|\\phi_F| + |V_{SB}|} - \\sqrt{2|\\phi_F|})$ is identical to our derived result $|V_{TP}| = |V_{TP0}| + \\gamma_p(\\sqrt{2|\\phi_F| + V_{BS}} - \\sqrt{2|\\phi_F|})$, correctly showing that $|V_{TP}|$ increases. The formula for $\\gamma_p$ is also correct. Correct.\n-   **Band Bending**: The statement \"surface potential relative to the source is $\\psi_s - V_{SB} = -2|\\phi_F|$\" is correct, where $\\psi_s$ is the surface potential relative to the body. This follows from the fact that the potential of the inversion layer relative to its source of carriers is fixed at $2\\phi_F = -2|\\phi_F|$ at threshold. From this, the algebra $\\psi_s = V_{SB} - 2|\\phi_F| = -|V_{SB}| - 2|\\phi_F| = -(2|\\phi_F|+|V_{SB}|)$ is correct. This represents a more negative surface-to-body potential. The corresponding additional upward energy band bending is $q|V_{SB}|$. This is consistent with a wider depletion region needed to support the larger potential drop. Correct.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Under reverse bias, $V_{SB} = V_B - V_S$ is positive. The threshold magnitude decreases with $V_{SB}$ according to $|V_{TP}(V_{SB})| = |V_{TP0}| - \\gamma_p\\!\\left(\\sqrt{2|\\phi_F| + V_{SB}} - \\sqrt{2|\\phi_F|}\\right)$. At threshold, the surface potential relative to the source is $\\psi_s - V_{SB} = -2|\\phi_F|$, implying a smaller band bending magnitude than at zero bias.**\n\n-   **Sign Convention**: If $V_{SB} = V_B - V_S$, it is positive for reverse bias. This is a valid convention.\n-   **Threshold Voltage**: The formula states that $|V_{TP}|$ *decreases* due to the minus sign before $\\gamma_p$. This is physically incorrect. The body effect always increases the magnitude of the threshold voltage.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Under reverse bias, $V_{SB} = V_S - V_B$ is positive. The threshold magnitude increases linearly with $|V_{SB}|$ according to $|V_{TP}(V_{SB})| = |V_{TP0}| + \\gamma_p |V_{SB}|$. At threshold, the surface potential is unchanged from zero bias, $\\psi_s = -2|\\phi_F|$, so band bending is independent of $V_{SB}$.**\n\n-   **Sign Convention**: The statement \"$V_{SB} = V_S - V_B$ is positive\" for reverse bias is a contradiction. For reverse bias, $V_B > V_S$, so $V_S - V_B$ must be negative.\n-   **Threshold Voltage**: It proposes a linear dependence, which is an approximation and less fundamental than the square-root dependence.\n-   **Band Bending**: It incorrectly claims the surface potential is unchanged.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Under reverse bias, $V_{SB} = V_S - V_B$ is negative. The threshold magnitude decreases with $|V_{SB}|$ according to $|V_{TP}(V_{SB})| = |V_{TP0}| - \\gamma_p\\!\\left(\\sqrt{2|\\phi_F| + |V_{SB}|} - \\sqrt{2|\\phi_F|}\\right)$. At threshold, the surface potential relative to the source is $\\psi_s - V_{SB} = -2|\\phi_F|$, which yields $\\psi_s = -2|\\phi_F| + |V_{SB}|$, indicating reduced band bending magnitude compared to zero-bias.**\n\n-   **Sign Convention**: Correct, $V_{SB} = V_S - V_B$ is negative.\n-   **Threshold Voltage**: It claims the threshold magnitude *decreases* with $|V_{SB}|$, which is physically incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only Option A presents a set of statements that are entirely consistent and physically accurate.",

Under the depletion approximation, for a depletion width $W$, the space-charge density $\\rho(x)$ is given by $\\rho(x) = -qN_{A}$ for $0 \\le x \\le W$ and $\\rho(x)=0$ for $x > W$.\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_s} = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le W\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_s = \\varepsilon_{s,r}\\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of silicon.\n\nWe integrate this equation once to find the electric field $E(x) = -d\\psi/dx$.

The potential difference across the depletion region is the total band bending. At threshold, the band bending required for strong inversion is $2\\phi_F$. A substrate bias $V_{SB} \\ge 0$ reverse-biases the source-body junction (and thus the channel-body junction), adding to the potential that must be supported by the depletion region. Therefore, the total potential drop across the depletion region is $2\\phi_F + V_{SB}$.

You measure the drain current $I_D(V_{GS};V_{DS},V_{SB})$ and the transconductance $g_m(V_{GS};V_{DS},V_{SB})$ at a small drain-to-source voltage $V_{DS}$, for several substrate biases $V_{SB} \\ge 0$. The substrate bias modifies the threshold voltage $V_T(V_{SB})$ through the body effect, and it also alters the vertical electric field in the channel which changes the effective mobility $\\mu$ via surface-scattering and Coulomb-scattering mechanisms. Assume the device is operated in the linear regime with $V_{DS} \\ll (V_{GS}-V_T)$ and no significant short-channel effects.\n\nStarting from the drift–diffusion description and the long-channel approximation that the channel current in the linear regime is driven by the inversion charge and the lateral electric field, and recognizing that the mobility experiences field-dependent degradation captured by a factor such as $\\mu(V_{GS},V_{SB}) = \\mu_0 / \\left(1+\\theta\\, (V_{GS}-V_T(V_{SB}))\\right)$ with $\\theta  0$ representing vertical-field mobility reduction, you want to extract $V_T(V_{SB})$ from the measured data in a way that minimizes ambiguities induced by the mobility changes with $V_{SB}$.\n\nWhich of the following transconductance-based extrapolation methods most robustly yields $V_T(V_{SB})$ from the small-$V_{DS}$ data, and why does it reduce mobility-induced ambiguities compared to directly extrapolating the linear-region $I_D$–$V_{GS}$ characteristics under varying $V_{SB}$?\n\nA. For each $V_{SB}$, compute $Y(V_{GS}) \\equiv I_D(V_{GS})/\\sqrt{g_m(V_{GS})}$ at fixed small $V_{DS}$, plot $Y$ versus $V_{GS}$ in moderate inversion, and take the $V_{GS}$-axis intercept as $V_T(V_{SB})$. The mobility-degradation factor cancels between $I_D$ and $g_m$ so that $Y$ is proportional to $(V_{GS}-V_T)$ independent of the specific $\\mu$ reduction, making the threshold extraction insensitive to changes in $\\mu$ with $V_{SB}$.\n\nB. For each $V_{SB}$, bias the device in saturation ($V_{DS}$ large) and plot $\\sqrt{I_D}$ versus $V_{GS}$, using the $V_{GS}$-axis intercept as $V_T(V_{SB})$.

It represents a standard challenge in experimental device characterization.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived by analyzing the provided options based on the given physical model.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe starting point is the drain current $I_D$ for a long-channel MOSFET operating in the linear regime. The current is given by the product of the inversion charge density, the effective mobility, the channel geometry, and the lateral electric field ($V_{DS}/L$).\nFor a small $V_{DS} \\ll (V_{GS}-V_T)$, the drain current is accurately approximated by:\n$$I_D \\approx \\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS}-V_T) V_{DS}$$\nThe problem states that the mobility $\\mu$ is field-dependent, given by the model:\n$$\\mu(V_{GS},V_{SB}) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T(V_{SB}))}$$\nSubstituting this expression for mobility into the drain current equation yields:\n$$I_D(V_{GS}) \\approx \\frac{\\mu_0}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS}-V_T) V_{DS}$$\nFor a fixed $V_{SB}$ and fixed small $V_{DS}$, we can group the constants. Let $\\beta_0 = \\mu_0 C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} V_{DS}$. Note that $\\mu_0$ and $\\theta$ may depend on $V_{SB}$, which is the source of the ambiguity we wish to eliminate. The threshold voltage $V_T$ is also a function of $V_{SB}$. For a fixed $V_{SB}$ measurement:\n$$I_D = \\frac{\\beta_0 (V_{GS}-V_T)}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)}$$\nThe transconductance, $g_m$, is the derivative of $I_D$ with respect to $V_{GS}$:\n$$g_m = \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}}$$\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation:\n$$g_m = \\frac{\\beta_0(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)) - \\beta_0(V_{GS}-V_T)\\theta}{(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))^2}$$\n$$g_m = \\frac{\\beta_0 + \\beta_0\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T) - \\beta_0\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)}{(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))^2}$$\n$$g_m = \\frac{\\beta_0}{(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))^2}$$\nThese expressions for $I_D$ and $g_m$ form the basis for evaluating each option.\n\n**Analysis of the reference method (direct $I_D-V_{GS}$ extrapolation):**\nIf mobility were constant ($\\theta = 0$), then $I_D = \\beta_0(V_{GS}-V_T)$, a linear relationship. The $V_{GS}$-axis intercept would be exactly $V_T$. However, with mobility degradation ($\\theta  0$), the $I_D-V_{GS}$ curve is sub-linear. A linear extrapolation from a segment of this curve will yield an incorrect value for $V_T$. Since the mobility parameters ($\\mu_0$, $\\theta$) may change with $V_{SB}$, the magnitude of this error will also change with $V_{SB}$, compromising the extraction of the true $V_T(V_{SB})$ relationship.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For each $V_{SB}$, compute $Y(V_{GS}) \\equiv I_D(V_{GS})/\\sqrt{g_m(V_{GS})}$ at fixed small $V_{DS}$, plot $Y$ versus $V_{GS}$ in moderate inversion, and take the $V_{GS}$-axis intercept as $V_T(V_{SB})$.**\n\nLet us construct the function $Y(V_{GS})$:\n$$Y = \\frac{I_D}{\\sqrt{g_m}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\beta_0 (V_{GS}-V_T)}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta_0}{(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))^2}}}$$\n$$Y = \\frac{\\frac{\\beta_0 (V_{GS}-V_T)}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{\\beta_0}}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)}}$$\n$$Y = \\frac{\\beta_0 (V_{GS}-V_T)}{\\sqrt{\\beta_0}} = \\sqrt{\\beta_0} (V_{GS}-V_T)$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\beta_0$:\n$$Y(V_{GS}) = \\sqrt{\\mu_0 C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} V_{DS}} (V_{GS}-V_T)$$\nThis equation shows that $Y$ is a perfectly linear function of $V_{GS}$. The $V_{GS}$-axis intercept of this line (where $Y=0$) is precisely $V_{GS} = V_T$. Importantly, the mobility degradation parameter $\\theta$ has been completely eliminated from the expression for $Y$. The low-field mobility $\\mu_0$ remains only in the slope of the line, $\\sqrt{\\beta_0}$. Therefore, even if $\\mu_0$ and $\\theta$ change with $V_{SB}$, the linearity of the $Y-V_{GS}$ plot is preserved for each $V_{SB}$, and its intercept accurately gives $V_T(V_{SB})$. This method is highly robust against mobility degradation effects and their variation with substrate bias. The claims in this option are fully supported by this derivation.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. For each $V_{SB}$, bias the device in saturation ($V_{DS}$ large) and plot $\\sqrt{I_D}$ versus $V_{GS}$, using the $V_{GS}$-axis intercept as $V_T(V_{SB})$.**\n\nThis method is invalid for two primary reasons. First, the problem explicitly states that the available data are measured \"at a small drain-to-source voltage $V_{DS}$\" in the \"linear regime\". This option requires data from the saturation regime, which contradicts the problem's premise. Second, the physical claim is flawed. In saturation, with mobility degradation, the current is approximately $I_D \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS}-V_T)^2$. Using the given mobility model, $\\sqrt{I_D}$ is proportional to $\\frac{V_{GS}-V_T}{\\sqrt{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)}}$. This is not a linear function of $V_{GS}$. Therefore, a linear extrapolation would be inaccurate, and the method is not \"immune to mobility variations\" as claimed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. For each $V_{SB}$, plot $g_m$ versus $V_{GS}$ at fixed small $V_{DS}$ and extrapolate the linear fit of $g_m(V_{GS})$ down to zero $g_m$ to obtain $V_T(V_{SB})$.**\n\nOur derived expression for transconductance in the linear regime is $g_m = \\frac{\\beta_0}{(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))^2}$. This function is not linear in $V_{GS}$. It is a decreasing function of $V_{GS}$ for $V_{GS}  V_T$. Thus, performing a linear fit to this curve is not justified. Furthermore, the claim that \"the influence of mobility is removed\" is false. The expression for $g_m$ clearly depends on both mobility parameters $\\mu_0$ (via $\\beta_0$) and $\\theta$. The method of extrapolating $g_m$ to find $V_T$ is typically applied in the saturation region for an ideal transistor (where $g_m$ is linear with $V_{GS}$), not the linear region.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. For each $V_{SB}$, calculate $Z(V_{GS}) \\equiv 2 I_D(V_{GS})/g_m(V_{GS})$ in the linear regime and take the $V_{GS}$-axis intercept of a linear fit of $Z(V_{GS})$ as $V_T(V_{SB})$.**\n\nLet us construct the function $Z(V_{GS})$:\n$$Z = \\frac{2I_D}{g_m} = \\frac{2 \\left( \\frac{\\beta_0 (V_{GS}-V_T)}{1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{\\beta_0}{(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))^2} \\right)}$$\n$$Z = 2(V_{GS}-V_T)(1+\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T))$$\n$$Z(V_{GS}) = 2(V_{GS}-V_T) + 2\\theta(V_{GS}-V_T)^2$$\nThis function $Z$ is a quadratic function of $(V_{GS}-V_T)$, not a linear one. While the low-field mobility parameter $\\mu_0$ (from $\\beta_0$) has cancelled out, the mobility degradation parameter $\\theta$ remains. Therefore, the claim that \"$Z$ is independent of $\\mu$\" is an oversimplification and not entirely true, as it still depends on the degradation aspect of mobility. A linear fit to a parabola is an approximation, and the resulting intercept would depend on the chosen fitting range and the value of $\\theta$. This method is not as robust as method A, which yields a truly linear relationship from which to extract $V_T$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn conclusion, the method described in option A, known as the Y-function method, is the most robust because it transforms the measured $I_D$ and $g_m$ data into a function $Y(V_{GS})$ that is perfectly linear with $V_{GS}$. The intercept of this line directly yields $V_T$, and this result is independent of the first-order mobility degradation parameter $\\theta$ and the low-field mobility $\\mu_0$, thus minimizing ambiguities arising from their dependence on $V_{SB}$.",
