It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all required information is provided. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of S(T)\n\nThe subthreshold drain current $I_D$ is due to carriers diffusing over the source-channel potential barrier. According to the provided information, the mobile carrier concentration at the top of the barrier is governed by Boltzmann statistics. This means the concentration is proportional to $\\exp(-E_b / (k_B T))$, where $E_b$ is the barrier height. In terms of electrical potential, the current is exponentially dependent on the surface potential $\\psi_s$, which sets the barrier height. The drain current $I_D$ can thus be written as:\n$$I_{D} \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\psi_{s}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nUsing the definition of thermal voltage, $V_{T} \\equiv k_{B}T/q$, this becomes:\n$$I_{D} = I_{D0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\psi_s}{V_T}\\right)$$\nwhere $I_{D0}$ is a pre-exponential factor that depends on device geometry and other parameters, but can be considered constant with respect to $V_G$ and $\\psi_s$ in the subthreshold region.\n\nThe subthreshold swing $S$ is defined as $S \\equiv dV_{G}/d\\left(\\log_{10} I_{D}\\right)$. To facilitate differentiation, we convert the base-$10$ logarithm to a natural logarithm using the identity $\\log_{10}(x) = \\ln(x) / \\ln(10)$:\n$$S = \\frac{dV_{G}}{d\\left(\\frac{\\ln I_{D}}{\\ln 10}\\right)} = \\ln(10) \\frac{dV_G}{d(\\ln I_D)}$$\nThis can be rewritten using the inverse of the derivative:\n$$S = \\ln(10) \\left(\\frac{d(\\ln I_{D})}{dV_G}\\right)^{-1}$$\nWe evaluate the derivative $d(\\ln I_{D})/dV_G$ using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln I_{D})}{dV_G} = \\frac{d(\\ln I_{D})}{d\\psi_s} \\frac{d\\psi_s}{dV_G}$$\nFrom the expression for $I_D$, we take the natural logarithm: $\\ln I_D = \\ln I_{D0} + \\psi_s/V_T$. Differentiating with respect to $\\psi_s$ gives:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln I_{D})}{d\\psi_s} = \\frac{1}{V_T}$$\nThe problem provides the electrostatic relationship between the gate voltage $V_G$ and the surface potential $\\psi_s$:\n$$\\frac{d\\psi_s}{dV_G} = \\frac{1}{n}$$\nSubstituting these two results back into the chain rule expression:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln I_{D})}{dV_G} = \\left(\\frac{1}{V_T}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n V_T}$$\nFinally, we substitute this into the equation for $S$:\n$$S = \\ln(10) \\left(\\frac{1}{n V_T}\\right)^{-1} = n \\ln(10) V_T$$\nTo find the explicit temperature dependence $S(T)$, we substitute the definition of the thermal voltage, $V_T = k_B T / q$:\n$$S(T) = n \\ln(10) \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right) = \\left( \\frac{n \\ln(10) k_B}{q} \\right) T$$\nThis shows that $S$ is a linear function of the absolute temperature $T$.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical coefficient using the given values: $n = 1.3$, $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$, and $q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$.\nThe coefficient is $\\frac{n \\ln(10) k_B}{q}$.\n$$\\text{Coefficient} = \\frac{1.3 \\times \\ln(10) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}}$$\n$$\\text{Coefficient} \\approx \\frac{1.3 \\times 2.302585 \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}} \\,\\mathrm{V/K}$$\n$$\\text{Coefficient} \\approx 2.99336 \\times 8.61733 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\mathrm{V/K} \\approx 0.000257934 \\,\\mathrm{V/K}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in units of $\\mathrm{mV/decade}$. Our formula for $S$ is already \"per decade\" due to the $\\ln(10)$ factor. We just need to convert Volts to milliVolts by multiplying by $1000$:\n$$\\text{Coefficient}_{\\mathrm{mV/K}} \\approx 0.000257934 \\times 1000 \\,\\mathrm{mV/K} = 0.257934 \\,\\mathrm{mV/K}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the coefficient is $0.2579$.\nTherefore, the final expression for the subthreshold swing as a function of temperature is:\n$$S(T) = 0.2579 \\, T$$\nwhere $T$ is in Kelvin and $S(T)$ is in $\\mathrm{mV/decade}$.\n\n### Explanation of Linear Scaling\nThe subthreshold swing $S(T)$ scales linearly with the thermal voltage $V_T$ because the underlying physical mechanism is thermal. The derived relationship is $S = n \\ln(10) V_T$. Since the slope factor $n$ is assumed to be constant and $\\ln(10)$ is a mathematical constant, $S$ is directly proportional to $V_T$. Physically, the subthreshold current arises from the high-energy tail of the Boltzmann-distributed charge carriers overcoming a potential barrier. The characteristic energy of this thermal distribution is $k_B T$. To change the current by a fixed factor (one decade), the barrier height must be modulated by an amount proportional to this thermal energy. The gate voltage $V_G$ controls the barrier height, and the subthreshold swing $S$ is precisely the change in $V_G$ needed for this modulation. Therefore, $S$ must scale directly with the thermal energy expressed in volts, which is the thermal voltage $V_T = k_B T / q$.\n\n### Practical Extraction of S and n\nTo practically extract the subthreshold swing $S$ and the slope factor $n$ from experimental data, one performs the following steps:\n1.  Measure the drain current $I_D$ as a function of the gate voltage $V_G$ for a small, constant drain-source voltage $V_{DS}$ (e.g., $50$-$100\\,\\mathrm{mV}$).\n2.  Plot the data on a semi-logarithmic scale, with $\\log_{10}(I_D)$ on the vertical axis and $V_G$ on the linear horizontal axis.\n3.  Identify the subthreshold region of operation, which appears as a straight line on this plot, situated between the \"off\" state (leakage current) and the \"on\" state (strong inversion).\n4.  Perform a linear fit to this straight-line portion of the curve. The slope of this line is $\\text{slope} = d(\\log_{10} I_D)/dV_G$.\n5.  The subthreshold swing $S$ is the reciprocal of this slope: $S = 1/\\text{slope}$. The units are typically expressed in millivolts per decade ($\\mathrm{mV/decade}$).\n6.  Once $S$ is determined and the measurement temperature $T$ is known, the slope factor $n$ can be calculated using the derived relationship $S = n \\ln(10) (k_B T / q)$. Rearranging for $n$:\n    $$n = \\frac{S}{\\ln(10) V_T} = \\frac{q S}{k_B T \\ln(10)}$$\n    An ideal MOSFET would have perfect gate control over the channel, corresponding to $n=1$ and a minimal subthreshold swing of $S_{\\text{ideal}} = \\ln(10) V_T \\approx 60\\,\\mathrm{mV/decade}$ at room temperature ($T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$). In practice, $n > 1$ due to the capacitive voltage divider formed by the gate oxide capacitance and the semiconductor's depletion capacitance.",

I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n**Part 1: Analytical Expression for $\\Delta V_{FB}$**\n\nThe gate voltage ($V_G$) applied to a MOS structure is balanced by the work function difference between the gate metal and the semiconductor ($\\phi_{ms}$), the potential drop across the oxide ($V_{ox}$), and the surface potential (band bending) in the semiconductor ($\\psi_s$). The governing equation is:\n$$V_G = \\phi_{ms} + V_{ox} + \\psi_s$$\nThe potential drop across the oxide, $V_{ox}$, results from the electric field in the oxide, which is established by the charge on the gate, $Q_G$. For a constant field, $V_{ox} = E_{ox} t_{ox}$. From Gauss's law at the gate electrode, the electric field is $E_{ox} = Q_G / \\epsilon_{ox}$, where $\\epsilon_{ox} = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of the oxide. Therefore,\n$$V_{ox} = \\frac{Q_G t_{ox}}{\\epsilon_{ox}} = \\frac{Q_G}{C_{ox}}$$\nwhere $C_{ox} = \\epsilon_{ox} / t_{ox}$ is the oxide capacitance per unit area.\n\nThe entire MOS structure must be charge neutral. The charge on the gate ($Q_G$) must balance the fixed oxide charge ($Q_f$), the charge in interface traps ($Q_{it}$), and the charge in the semiconductor ($Q_s$). The problem states that the fixed charge can be treated as a sheet charge at the interface and that $C_{it}=0$, implying $Q_{it}=0$. The charge neutrality condition is:\n$$Q_G + Q_f + Q_s = 0$$\nFrom this, we find the gate charge: $Q_G = -(Q_f + Q_s)$. Substituting this into the expression for $V_{ox}$ gives:\n$$V_{ox} = -\\frac{Q_f + Q_s}{C_{ox}}$$\nNow, substituting this $V_{ox}$ back into the main gate voltage equation:\n$$V_G = \\phi_{ms} + \\psi_s - \\frac{Q_f + Q_s}{C_{ox}}$$\nThe flatband voltage, $V_{FB}$, is defined as the specific gate voltage that results in zero band bending in the semiconductor, i.e., $\\psi_s = 0$. When $\\psi_s = 0$, the net charge within the semiconductor is also zero, so $Q_s = 0$. Applying these conditions to the gate voltage equation gives the expression for $V_{FB}$:\n$$V_{FB} = \\phi_{ms} + 0 - \\frac{Q_f + 0}{C_{ox}} = \\phi_{ms} - \\frac{Q_f}{C_{ox}}$$\nThe problem asks for the change in flatband voltage, $\\Delta V_{FB}$, caused solely by the presence of $Q_f$. This is the difference between the flatband voltage of the device with fixed charge and an otherwise identical ideal device where $Q_f=0$.\n$$V_{FB, \\text{with } Q_f} = \\phi_{ms} - \\frac{Q_f}{C_{ox}}$$\n$$V_{FB, \\text{ideal}} = \\phi_{ms} - \\frac{0}{C_{ox}} = \\phi_{ms}$$\nThe change is therefore:\n$$\\Delta V_{FB} = V_{FB, \\text{with } Q_f} - V_{FB, \\text{ideal}} = \\left(\\phi_{ms} - \\frac{Q_f}{C_{ox}}\\right) - \\phi_{ms} = -\\frac{Q_f}{C_{ox}}$$\nThe fixed charge per unit area, $Q_f$, is given by the areal density $N_f$ times the elementary charge $q$, so $Q_f = q N_f$. The oxide capacitance per unit area is $C_{ox} = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 / t_{ox}$. Substituting these yields the final analytical expression:\n$$\\Delta V_{FB} = -\\frac{q N_f}{\\frac{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0}{t_{ox}}} = -\\frac{q N_f t_{ox}}{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0}$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of $\\Delta V_{FB}$**\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- $q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}$\n- $N_{f} = 3.5 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\text{cm}^{-2}$\n- $t_{ox} = 2.2 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}$\n- $\\epsilon_{r} = 3.9$\n- $\\epsilon_{0} = 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we must ensure all units are in the MKS system.

The relationship is approximately given by $I_D \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$. The surface potential $\\psi_s$ is, in turn, controlled by the gate voltage $V_G$. The effect of the fixed charge $Q_f$ is to introduce a constant offset to the gate voltage required to achieve any given surface potential. As shown in Part 1, the flatband voltage is shifted by $\\Delta V_{FB} = -Q_f / C_{ox}$. This shift propagates to the threshold voltage $V_{th}$, such that $V_{th, \\text{new}} = V_{th, \\text{old}} + \\Delta V_{FB}$. Because the entire device characteristic is a function of the effective gate overdrive voltage (e.g., $V_G - V_{th}$), shifting $V_{th}$ by a constant amount results in a rigid horizontal shift of the entire $I_D$-$V_G$ curve along the $V_G$ axis by that same amount, $\\Delta V_{FB}$.\n\nThe subthreshold swing, $S$, is a measure of the slope of the $I_D$-$V_G$ characteristic on a log-linear scale. It is defined as the change in gate voltage required to change the drain current by one decade:\n$$S = \\left( \\frac{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}{dV_G} \\right)^{-1} = \\ln(10) \\frac{dV_G}{d(\\ln I_D)}$$\nUsing $I_D \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$, we find $\\ln(I_D) = \\frac{q\\psi_s}{k_B T} + \\text{constant}$. Differentiating with respect to $V_G$ gives $\\frac{d(\\ln I_D)}{dV_G} = \\frac{q}{k_B T} \\frac{d\\psi_s}{dV_G}$. The subthreshold swing becomes:\n$$S = \\ln(10) \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\left(\\frac{d\\psi_s}{dV_G}\\right)^{-1}$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{d\\psi_s}{dV_G}$ represents the effectiveness of the gate in controlling the surface potential. It is determined by the capacitive voltage divider formed by the oxide capacitance ($C_{ox}$) and the total semiconductor surface capacitance ($C_s = C_{dep} + C_{it}$).\n$$\\frac{dV_G}{d\\psi_s} = 1 + \\frac{C_s}{C_{ox}} = 1 + \\frac{C_{dep} + C_{it}}{C_{ox}}$$\nSince the problem specifies that there are no interface traps, $C_{it} = 0$. The expression for the swing is:\n$$S = \\ln(10) \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\left(1 + \\frac{C_{dep}}{C_{ox}}\\right)$$\nThe fixed oxide charge $Q_f$ is assumed to be constant and independent of the gate voltage or surface potential. Therefore, it does not contribute to the voltage-dependent capacitance of the structure. It does not alter the physical parameters that determine $C_{ox}$ (i.e., $\\epsilon_{ox}$, $t_{ox}$) or the function $C_{dep}(\\psi_s)$ (which depends on doping). Since $S$ depends only on $T$, $C_{ox}$, and $C_{dep}$, and none of these are altered by a constant $Q_f$, the subthreshold swing remains unchanged. Mathematically, adding a constant offset ($\\Delta V_{FB}$) to the independent variable ($V_G$) does not change the derivative of the function, and thus the slope of the characteristic remains the same.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. All conditions and provided values are physically realistic for a MOSFET operating in the specified regime.\n\nThe subthreshold swing, $S$, is a key figure of merit for a MOSFET, representing the change in gate voltage required to change the drain current by one decade. It is defined as:\n$$S = \\left( \\frac{d(\\log_{10} I_{D})}{dV_{G}} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{dV_{G}}{d(\\log_{10} I_{D})}$$\nwhere $I_D$ is the drain current and $V_G$ is the gate voltage.\n\nFirst, we consider the intrinsic device, free from parasitic series resistance. In the weak inversion (subthreshold) regime, the drain current is dominated by diffusion and depends exponentially on the surface potential, $\\psi_s$. For a long-channel device with a drain-to-source voltage $V_{DS}$ much larger than the thermal voltage $V_T = k_B T / e$, the current is given by:\n$$I_{D} \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\psi_s}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe surface potential $\\psi_s$ is linearly related to the internal gate-to-source voltage, $V_{GS,int}$. A change in $V_{GS,int}$ causes a scaled change in $\\psi_s$:\n$$\\Delta \\psi_s = \\frac{1}{n} \\Delta V_{GS,int}$$\nwhere $n \\ge 1$ is the body factor (or subthreshold slope factor), which is assumed to be constant. For an ideal MOSFET, $n=1$. Combining these relations, the drain current is an exponential function of the internal gate-to-source voltage:\n$$I_{D} = I_{D0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{e V_{GS,int}}{n k_B T}\\right) = I_{D0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{GS,int}}{n V_T}\\right)$$\nHere, $I_{D0}$ is a pre-exponential factor that depends on device geometry and material properties.\n\nThe intrinsic subthreshold swing, $S_{int}$, corresponds to the case where the measured voltage is the internal voltage, i.e., $V_G = V_{GS,int}$. We can derive $S_{int}$ as follows:\n$$\\log_{10}(I_D) = \\log_{10}(I_{D0}) + \\frac{V_{GS,int}}{n V_T} \\log_{10}(e) = \\log_{10}(I_{D0}) + \\frac{V_{GS,int}}{n V_T \\ln(10)}$$\n$$S_{int} = \\frac{dV_{GS,int}}{d(\\log_{10} I_D)} = n V_T \\ln(10)$$\nThis is the true subthreshold swing of the channel itself.\n\nNow, we introduce the source series resistance, $R_S$. The external source terminal is grounded, so its potential is $0$. The current $I_D$ flowing through $R_S$ creates a voltage drop, raising the potential of the internal source node to $V_{S,int} = I_D R_S$. The external gate voltage is $V_g$. Therefore, the internal gate-to-source voltage is:\n$$V_{GS,int} = V_g - V_{S,int} = V_g - I_D R_S$$\nThe analyst measures the terminal quantities: the external gate voltage $V_g$ and the terminal drain current $I_D$. The measured subthreshold swing, $S_{meas}$, is therefore:\n$$S_{meas} = \\frac{dV_g}{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}$$\nTo evaluate this, we differentiate the expression for $V_g$ with respect to $\\log_{10}(I_D)$:\n$$V_g = V_{GS,int} + I_D R_S$$\n$$\\frac{d V_g}{d(\\log_{10} I_D)} = \\frac{d V_{GS,int}}{d(\\log_{10} I_D)} + \\frac{d(I_D R_S)}{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}$$\nThe term on the left is $S_{meas}$. The first term on the right is, by definition, the intrinsic subthreshold swing, $S_{int}$. The second term represents the effect of the series resistance. Since $R_S$ is constant:\n$$ \\frac{d(I_D R_S)}{d(\\log_{10} I_D)} = R_S \\frac{dI_D}{d(\\log_{10} I_D)} $$\nTo evaluate the derivative $\\frac{dI_D}{d(\\log_{10} I_D)}$, we use the chain rule. Let $y = \\log_{10}(I_D)$, which means $I_D = 10^y$. Then:\n$$\\frac{dI_D}{dy} = \\frac{d(10^y)}{dy} = 10^y \\ln(10) = I_D \\ln(10)$$\nSubstituting this result back, we have:\n$$S_{meas} = S_{int} + R_S \\left( I_D \\ln(10) \\right) = S_{int} + \\ln(10) I_D R_S$$\nThe additive error, $\\Delta S$, is the difference between the measured swing and the true intrinsic swing, which arises from ignoring $R_S$.\n$$\\Delta S = S_{meas} - S_{int}$$\nTherefore, the expression for the additive error is:\n$$\\Delta S = \\ln(10) I_D R_S$$\nThis expression depends only on the measured current $I_D$ and the known resistance $R_S$, as requested. It is independent of temperature and the body factor $n$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\Delta S$ numerically for the given values:\n$R_S = 10\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega = 1.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\Omega$\n$I_D = 50\\,\\mathrm{nA} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\Delta S$:\n$$\\Delta S = \\ln(10) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{A}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\Omega)$$\n$$\\Delta S = \\ln(10) \\times (5.0 \\times 1.0) \\times 10^{-8+4}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n$$\\Delta S = \\ln(10) \\times 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$\\Delta S \\approx 2.302585 \\times 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 11.512925 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n$$\\Delta S \\approx 1.1512925 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in units of millivolts per decade ($\\mathrm{mV/dec}$). The unit of swing is Volts/decade, so we convert Volts to millivolts:\n$$\\Delta S \\approx 1.1512925\\,\\mathrm{mV/dec}$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\Delta S \\approx 1.151\\,\\mathrm{mV/dec}$$",
