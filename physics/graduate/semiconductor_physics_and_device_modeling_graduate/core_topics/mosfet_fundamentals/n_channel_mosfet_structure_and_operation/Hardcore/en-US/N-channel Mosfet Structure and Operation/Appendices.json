A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe drain current $I_D$ in an n-channel MOSFET, under the drift-diffusion and gradual channel approximations, is given by the product of the mobile charge per unit length and the electron drift velocity. The mobile inversion charge per unit area, $Q_i(x)$, in the charge-sheet model is given as a function of the local channel potential $V(x)$:\n$$Q_i(x) = -C_{\\text{ox}} (V_{GS} - V(x) - V_T)$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{ox}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area. The longitudinal electric field is $E_x(x) = -\\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$. The drift current is therefore:\n$$I_D = W \\cdot |Q_i(x)| \\cdot \\mu_n \\cdot E_x(x) = W \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} (V_{GS} - V_T - V(x)) \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$$\nThis equation is valid along the conductive part of the channel, from the source ($x=0$) to the pinch-off point ($x=x_p$). To find the total current, we integrate this expression over the length of the conductive channel. Since $I_D$ is constant along the channel, we can write:\n$$I_D \\int_{0}^{x_p} dx = W \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} \\int_{V(0)}^{V(x_p)} (V_{GS} - V_T - V) dV$$\nThe boundary conditions are $V(0) = 0$ at the source and $V(x_p)$ at the pinch-off point. The pinch-off condition is defined as $Q_i(x_p) = 0$, which implies:\n$$V_{GS} - V(x_p) - V_T = 0 \\implies V(x_p) = V_{GS} - V_T$$\nAs per the problem statement, this is $V_{DS,\\text{sat}}$. So, $V(x_p) = V_{DS,\\text{sat}}$.\n\nIntegrating the current equation with these boundary conditions:\n$$I_D \\cdot x_p = W \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)V - \\frac{1}{2}V^2 \\right]_{0}^{V_{DS,\\text{sat}}}$$\n$$I_D \\cdot x_p = W \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} \\left( (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS,\\text{sat}} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS,\\text{sat}}^2 \\right)$$\nSubstituting $V_{DS,\\text{sat}} = V_{GS} - V_T$:\n$$I_D \\cdot x_p = W \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} \\left( (V_{GS} - V_T)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(V_{GS} - V_T)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}W \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2$$\nThus, the drain current is:\n$$I_D = \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}}}{2 x_p} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2$$\nThe effective channel length is $x_p$. The region between $x=x_p$ and the drain at $x=L$ is the pinch-off or high-field region, of length $\\Delta L = L - x_p$. The potential drop across this region is $V_{DS} - V(x_p) = V_{DS} - V_{DS,\\text{sat}}$. The problem states that the electric field in this region is uniform and equal to $E_c$.\n$$E_c = \\frac{V_{DS} - V_{DS,\\text{sat}}}{\\Delta L}$$\nFrom this, we can solve for the channel length shortening, $\\Delta L$:\n$$\\Delta L = \\frac{V_{DS} - V_{DS,\\text{sat}}}{E_c}$$\nThe position of the pinch-off point $x_p$ is then:\n$$x_p = L - \\Delta L = L - \\frac{V_{DS} - V_{DS,\\text{sat}}}{E_c}$$\nNow we have all the expressions required to calculate the requested quantities.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the constants and intermediate values:\n*   Oxide permittivity: $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}} = 3.9 \\times \\varepsilon_{0} = 3.9 \\times (8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F/m}) \\approx 3.453133 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{F/m}$.\n*   Oxide capacitance per unit area: $C_{\\text{ox}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}} = \\frac{3.453133 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{F/m}}{3.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}} \\approx 0.0115104\\,\\text{F/m}^2$.\n*   Saturation voltage: $V_{DS,\\text{sat}} = V_{GS} - V_T = 1.2\\,\\text{V} - 0.4\\,\\text{V} = 0.8\\,\\text{V}$.\n*   Voltage across the pinch-off region: $V_{DS} - V_{DS,\\text{sat}} = 1.0\\,\\text{V} - 0.8\\,\\text{V} = 0.2\\,\\text{V}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the three final quantities:\n\n1.  **Channel Length Shortening ($\\Delta L$)**:\n    $$\\Delta L = \\frac{V_{DS} - V_{DS,\\text{sat}}}{E_c} = \\frac{0.2\\,\\text{V}}{1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{V/m}} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m} = 0.2000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $\\Delta L = 0.2000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n2.  **Pinch-off Point Position ($x_p$)**:\n    $$x_p = L - \\Delta L = (5.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}) - (0.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}) = (0.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}) - (0.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}) = 0.3 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m} = 0.3000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $x_p = 0.3000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n3.  **Drain Current ($I_D$)**:\n    $$I_D = \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{\\text{ox}}}{2 x_p} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2$$\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $$I_D = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}) \\cdot (5.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{m}^2\\text{V}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (0.0115104\\,\\text{F/m}^2)}{2 \\cdot (0.3 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m})} \\cdot (0.8\\,\\text{V})^2$$\n    $$I_D = \\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{-7}) \\cdot (0.0115104)}{0.6 \\times 10^{-6}} \\cdot (0.64)\\,\\text{A}$$\n    $$I_D = \\frac{5.7552 \\times 10^{-9}}{0.6 \\times 10^{-6}} \\cdot 0.64\\,\\text{A} = (9.592 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot 0.64\\,\\text{A}$$\n    $$I_D \\approx 6.13888 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{A} = 6.13888\\,\\text{mA}$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $I_D = 6.139\\,\\text{mA}$.\n\nThe requested values are $x_p = 0.3000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, $\\Delta L = 0.2000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, and $I_D = 6.139\\,\\text{mA}$.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivations and Calculations\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution starting from first principles.\n\n**Part 1: Relating $(G_{p}/\\omega)_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ to Interface Trap Capacitance**\n\nThe response of interface traps to a small AC signal can be modeled by an equivalent circuit. For the entire device area $A$, the collective behavior of interface traps at a given energy is represented by the total interface trap capacitance, $C_{it,tot}$, in series with a total capture/emission resistance, $R_{it,tot}$. This series combination is in parallel with the oxide and depletion capacitances. The admittance of the interface trap branch, $Y_{it,tot}$, is given by:\n$$ Y_{it,tot} = \\frac{1}{R_{it,tot} + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C_{it,tot}}} $$\nwhere $j = \\sqrt{-1}$ is the imaginary unit and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. This can be rewritten as:\n$$ Y_{it,tot} = \\frac{j\\omega C_{it,tot}}{1 + j\\omega R_{it,tot} C_{it,tot}} $$\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n$$ Y_{it,tot} = \\frac{j\\omega C_{it,tot}(1 - j\\omega R_{it,tot} C_{it,tot})}{1 + (\\omega R_{it,tot} C_{it,tot})^2} = \\frac{\\omega^2 R_{it,tot} C_{it,tot}^2}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_{it})^2} + j \\frac{\\omega C_{it,tot}}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_{it})^2} $$\nwhere $\\tau_{it} = R_{it,tot} C_{it,tot}$ is the interface trap time constant.\n\nThe measured parallel conductance of the device, $G_p$, is the real part of this admittance. Thus:\n$$ G_p = \\mathrm{Re}(Y_{it,tot}) = \\frac{\\omega^2 \\tau_{it} C_{it,tot}}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_{it})^2} $$\nThe problem is formulated in terms of $G_p/\\omega$:\n$$ \\frac{G_p}{\\omega} = \\frac{\\omega \\tau_{it} C_{it,tot}}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_{it})^2} $$\nTo find the peak of this quantity as a function of frequency, we find the maximum of the expression. Let $x = \\omega \\tau_{it}$. We want to maximize $f(x) = \\frac{x C_{it,tot}}{1+x^2}$. We compute the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{df}{dx} = C_{it,tot} \\frac{1 \\cdot (1+x^2) - x \\cdot (2x)}{(1+x^2)^2} = C_{it,tot} \\frac{1-x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} = 0 $$\nThe maximum occurs when $1-x^2=0$, which implies $x=1$. This corresponds to the condition $\\omega \\tau_{it} = 1$. Substituting this condition back into the expression for $G_p/\\omega$ gives the peak value:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{G_p}{\\omega}\\right)_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot C_{it,tot}}{1+1^2} = \\frac{C_{it,tot}}{2} $$\nFrom this, we find the total interface trap capacitance: $C_{it,tot} = 2 \\left(\\frac{G_p}{\\omega}\\right)_{\\mathrm{peak}}$. The capacitance per unit area, $C_{it}/A$, is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{C_{it}}{A} = \\frac{C_{it,tot}}{A} = \\frac{2}{A} \\left(\\frac{G_p}{\\omega}\\right)_{\\mathrm{peak}} $$\nThis is the relationship required by the first part of the problem. Now, we compute its value for the three given data points using $A = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n\n- At $f = 100 \\,\\mathrm{kHz}$:\n$$ \\frac{C_{it}}{A} = \\frac{2 \\times (2.00 \\times 10^{-11} \\,\\mathrm{F})}{1.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2} = 4.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{cm}^2 $$\n- At $f = 200 \\,\\mathrm{kHz}$:\n$$ \\frac{C_{it}}{A} = \\frac{2 \\times (1.96 \\times 10^{-11} \\,\\mathrm{F})}{1.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2} = 3.92 \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{cm}^2 $$\n- At $f = 500 \\,\\mathrm{kHz}$:\n$$ \\frac{C_{it}}{A} = \\frac{2 \\times (1.93 \\times 10^{-11} \\,\\mathrm{F})}{1.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2} = 3.86 \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{cm}^2 $$\n\n**Part 2: Relating Interface Trap Capacitance to Density of States and Extraction of $D_{it}$**\n\nThe second part is to derive the connection between the low-frequency interface trap capacitance per unit area, $C_{it}/A$, and the interface trap density per unit energy per unit area, $D_{it}$, which is expressed in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}$.\n\nThe interface trap capacitance per unit area is defined as the magnitude of the change in the trapped charge density, $\\sigma_{it}$, per unit change in the surface potential, $\\psi_s$:\n$$ \\frac{C_{it}}{A} = \\left| \\frac{d\\sigma_{it}}{d\\psi_s} \\right| $$\nThe trapped charge density $\\sigma_{it}$ depends on the density of states $D_{it}$ and their occupancy, which is determined by the position of the Fermi level at the surface, $E_{F,s}$. For a continuum of acceptor-like traps (which become negatively charged when occupied by an electron), the change in trapped charge density $d\\sigma_{it}$ resulting from a change in the Fermi level $dE_{F,s}$ is:\n$$ d\\sigma_{it} = -q \\, dN_{it} = -q \\, D_{it}(E_{F,s}) \\, dE_{F,s} $$\nHere, $D_{it}$ is in units of states per area per unit energy, and $q$ is the elementary charge. A change in surface potential $d\\psi_s$ (in Volts) causes a shift in the energy bands at the surface. Specifically, a $1\\,\\mathrm{V}$ change in $\\psi_s$ shifts the bands by $1\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Thus, the change in the Fermi level position relative to the bands, $dE_{F,s}$, measured in $\\mathrm{eV}$, is numerically equal to the change in surface potential, $d\\psi_s$, measured in Volts:\n$$ dE_{F,s} [\\mathrm{eV}] = d\\psi_s [\\mathrm{V}] $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $d\\sigma_{it}$:\n$$ d\\sigma_{it} = -q \\, D_{it} \\, d\\psi_s $$\nNow we can compute the capacitance per unit area:\n$$ \\frac{C_{it}}{A} = \\left| \\frac{d\\sigma_{it}}{d\\psi_s} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{-q \\, D_{it} \\, d\\psi_s}{d\\psi_s} \\right| = q D_{it} $$\nThis gives the desired relationship for the low-frequency capacitance.

            "introduction": "As MOSFETs are scaled to nanometer dimensions, the simple Gradual Channel Approximation (GCA) begins to fail as two-dimensional electrostatic effects become dominant. This computational exercise challenges you to build and compare a basic GCA model against a compact model that incorporates key short-channel effects like Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) and Channel-Length Modulation (CLM). By implementing these models, you will quantitatively evaluate the limitations of the GCA and identify the specific operating regimes where it breaks down, a fundamental task in modern device modeling.

            "problem": "You are to implement two physically grounded current models for an n-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) and evaluate the limitations of the Gradual Channel Approximation (GCA) compared to a two-dimensional (2D-aware) compact reference that includes Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) and Channel-Length Modulation (CLM). The objective is to compute, for specified short-channel devices, the relative error in drain current $I_D$ produced by the GCA model compared to the 2D-aware reference, and to identify regimes where the GCA fails to capture DIBL and CLM according to explicit, physically motivated criteria.\n\nStarting from the semiconductor fundamentals, use the one-dimensional electrostatics of the MOS capacitor and drift-diffusion transport under strong inversion as the modeling base:\n- Electrostatics: Poisson’s equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\varepsilon \\nabla \\psi \\right) = -\\rho$, depletion approximation, and the threshold condition associated with strong inversion.\n- Transport: Electron current density $J_n = q n \\mu_n \\mathcal{E} + q D_n \\nabla n$, charge control in the channel, and the quasi-static assumption consistent with GCA.\n\nYou must implement:\n- A GCA-based long-channel model that ignores two-dimensional short-channel effects (no DIBL, no CLM), but includes vertical-field mobility degradation in strong inversion. Use strong inversion-only current expressions with a consistent region check (linear region versus saturation) based on the local overdrive and drain voltage. Denote the threshold voltage from MOS electrostatics as $V_{T0}$ and the effective mobility as $\\mu_{\\text{eff}}$.\n- A 2D-aware compact reference that augments the GCA structure to capture short-channel effects by incorporating DIBL via an effective threshold shift and CLM via an output conductance factor in saturation. Use an effective threshold $V_{T,\\text{eff}}$ and apply CLM only in saturation.\n\nPhysical constants and parameters must be used in the International System of Units (SI). The following constants are to be used:\n- Elementary charge $q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$.\n- Boltzmann constant $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$.\n- Temperature $T = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n- Vacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}$.\n- Silicon relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si,r}} = 11.7$, hence $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si,r}} \\varepsilon_0$.\n- Silicon dioxide relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox,r}} = 3.9$, hence $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox,r}} \\varepsilon_0$.\n- Intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n\nModel elements to be derived and used:\n- Threshold voltage $V_{T0}$ from MOS electrostatics given substrate doping $N_A$, oxide thickness $t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, and flatband voltage $V_{\\mathrm{fb}}$. Use the standard inversion condition with Fermi potential $\\phi_F = \\left( k_B T / q \\right) \\ln \\left( N_A / n_i \\right)$, body-effect coefficient $\\gamma = \\sqrt{ 2 q \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} N_A } / C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, and oxide capacitance per area $C_{\\mathrm{ox}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} / t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$.\n- Vertical-field mobility degradation modeled as $\\mu_{\\text{eff}} = \\mu_0 / \\left( 1 + \\theta \\max \\left( V_{GS} - V_T, 0 \\right) \\right)$, where $V_T$ is the threshold used by the respective model.\n- Region determination consistent with strong inversion: linear region when $V_{DS} \\le V_{ov}$ and saturation otherwise, where $V_{ov}$ is the overdrive defined by $V_{ov} = V_{GS} - V_T$.\n\nYour program must compute, for each test case:\n1. The GCA drain current $I_{D,\\mathrm{GCA}}$ using $V_T = V_{T0}$ with no DIBL and no CLM, and with $\\mu_{\\text{eff}}$ defined by the GCA overdrive.\n2. The 2D-aware drain current $I_{D,\\mathrm{2D}}$ using an effective threshold $V_{T,\\mathrm{eff}} = V_{T0} - \\eta V_{DS}$ to represent Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL), the same mobility degradation law but evaluated with the 2D-aware overdrive, and Channel-Length Modulation (CLM) via a multiplicative factor in saturation $(1 + \\lambda V_{DS})$.\n3. The relative error in drain current, defined as a decimal value without a percent sign, comparing the GCA and 2D-aware currents. Express it as a dimensionless float.\n4. Two boolean indicators identifying regimes where the GCA fails to capture DIBL and CLM respectively, according to the following criteria:\n   - DIBL failure is flagged when the device is short-channel and highly drained: $L \\le 100\\ \\mathrm{nm}$, $V_{DS} \\ge 0.5\\ \\mathrm{V}$, and the relative threshold shift is non-negligible: $\\Delta V_T / V_{ov,\\mathrm{2D}} \\ge 0.2$, where $\\Delta V_T = \\eta V_{DS}$ and $V_{ov,\\mathrm{2D}} = V_{GS} - V_{T,\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n   - CLM failure is flagged when the 2D-aware model is in saturation and the CLM magnitude is non-negligible: $\\lambda V_{DS} \\ge 0.05$ and $L \\le 100\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nAll currents must be computed in amperes ($\\mathrm{A}$). The final output is to be a list of results for the test suite, where each test case produces a list of three values: the relative error (float), the DIBL failure flag (boolean), and the CLM failure flag (boolean).\n\nThe test suite consists of three parameter sets, each specified as a tuple in the order:\n$\\left( L,\\ W,\\ t_{\\mathrm{ox}},\\ N_A,\\ V_{GS},\\ V_{DS},\\ \\mu_0,\\ \\theta,\\ \\eta,\\ \\lambda \\right)$, with $V_{\\mathrm{fb}}$ fixed to $-0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}$ for all cases:\n- Case $1$ (long channel, low drain): $\\left( 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m},\\ 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m},\\ 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m},\\ 1.0 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3},\\ 1.00\\ \\mathrm{V},\\ 0.10\\ \\mathrm{V},\\ 0.05\\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V\\,s)},\\ 0.1\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1},\\ 0.05\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1},\\ 0.02\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1} \\right)$.\n- Case $2$ (short channel, high drain): $\\left( 4.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m},\\ 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m},\\ 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m},\\ 1.0 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3},\\ 1.00\\ \\mathrm{V},\\ 1.00\\ \\mathrm{V},\\ 0.05\\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V\\,s)},\\ 0.1\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1},\\ 0.15\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1},\\ 0.10\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1} \\right)$.\n- Case $3$ (near triode-to-saturation boundary, moderate drain): $\\left( 8.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m},\\ 1.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m},\\ 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m},\\ 1.0 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3},\\ 0.90\\ \\mathrm{V},\\ 0.30\\ \\mathrm{V},\\ 0.05\\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V\\,s)},\\ 0.1\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1},\\ 0.10\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1},\\ 0.05\\ \\mathrm{V}^{-1} \\right)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each test case result is itself a list of three entries $\\left[ \\text{relative\\_error},\\ \\text{dibl\\_fail},\\ \\text{clm\\_fail} \\right]$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation and comparison of two n-channel MOSFET current models: a basic Gradual Channel Approximation (GCA) model and a more physically complete 2D-aware model incorporating short-channel effects. The objective is to quantify the error of the simpler GCA model and identify operating regimes where it fails significantly. The solution is derived from fundamental semiconductor electrostatics and transport principles.\n\nFirst, we define the physical constants and calculate preliminary parameters common to both models. All values are in SI units.\n- Elementary charge: $q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$\n- Boltzmann constant: $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$\n- Temperature: $T = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- Vacuum permittivity: $\\varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}$\n- Silicon relative permittivity: $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si,r}} = 11.7$\n- Silicon dioxide relative permittivity: $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox,r}} = 3.9$\n- Intrinsic carrier concentration: $n_i = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- Flatband voltage: $V_{\\mathrm{fb}} = -0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n\nFrom these, we derive key device parameters:\n- Thermal voltage: $V_{th} = k_B T / q$\n- Silicon permittivity: $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si,r}} \\varepsilon_0$\n- Oxide permittivity: $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox,r}} \\varepsilon_0$\n- Oxide capacitance per unit area: $C_{\\mathrm{ox}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} / t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$\n- Fermi potential, which measures the doping level relative to the intrinsic level: $\\phi_F = V_{th} \\ln(N_A / n_i)$\n- Body-effect coefficient, which characterizes the influence of the depletion charge: $\\gamma = \\sqrt{2 q \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} N_A} / C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$\n- The long-channel threshold voltage, $V_{T0}$, is calculated based on the 1D MOS capacitor electrostatics at the onset of strong inversion (surface potential $\\psi_s = 2 \\phi_F$). Assuming zero source-body voltage ($V_{SB}=0$):\n$$V_{T0} = V_{\\mathrm{fb}} + 2 \\phi_F + \\gamma \\sqrt{2 \\phi_F}$$\n\nWith these parameters established, we now define the two current models.\n\n**1. Gradual Channel Approximation (GCA) Model ($I_{D,\\mathrm{GCA}}$)**\nThis is a first-order model that assumes the channel electric field is predominantly vertical. It neglects 2D electrostatic effects like DIBL and CLM.\n\n- The threshold voltage is constant: $V_T = V_{T0}$.\n- The overdrive voltage is $V_{ov,\\mathrm{GCA}} = V_{GS} - V_{T0}$. The device is considered ON (in strong inversion) only if $V_{ov,\\mathrm{GCA}} > 0$. Otherwise, $I_{D,\\mathrm{GCA}} = 0$.\n- The effective electron mobility, $\\mu_{\\text{eff}}$, is reduced by the vertical electric field, modeled as:\n$$\\mu_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{1 + \\theta V_{ov,\\mathrm{GCA}}}$$\n- The device transconductance parameter is $\\beta_{\\text{eff}} = \\mu_{\\text{eff}} (W/L) C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$.\n- The drain current $I_{D,\\mathrm{GCA}}$ depends on the region of operation:\n  - Linear Region ($0 < V_{DS} \\le V_{ov,\\mathrm{GCA}}$):\n  $$I_{D,\\mathrm{GCA}} = \\beta_{\\text{eff}} \\left( V_{ov,\\mathrm{GCA}} V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2} V_{DS}^2 \\right)$$\n  - Saturation Region ($V_{DS} > V_{ov,\\mathrm{GCA}}$):\n  $$I_{D,\\mathrm{GCA}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\beta_{\\text{eff}} V_{ov,\\mathrm{GCA}}^2$$\n\n**2. 2D-Aware Compact Model ($I_{D,\\mathrm{2D}}$)**\nThis model enhances the GCA framework by incorporating first-order corrections for short-channel effects.\n\n- **Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL)**: The drain voltage influences the channel electrostatics, lowering the source-channel potential barrier. This is modeled as a linear reduction in the threshold voltage:\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{eff}} = V_{T0} - \\eta V_{DS}$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the DIBL coefficient.\n- The 2D-aware overdrive voltage is $V_{ov,\\mathrm{2D}} = V_{GS} - V_{T,\\mathrm{eff}}$. The device is ON if $V_{ov,\\mathrm{2D}} > 0$. Otherwise, $I_{D,\\mathrm{2D}} = 0$.\n- The effective mobility is calculated similarly, but using the 2D-aware overdrive:\n$$\\mu_{\\text{eff,2D}} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{1 + \\theta V_{ov,\\mathrm{2D}}}$$\n- The corresponding transconductance parameter is $\\beta_{\\text{eff,2D}} = \\mu_{\\text{eff,2D}} (W/L) C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$.\n- **Channel-Length Modulation (CLM)**: In saturation, the effective channel length is reduced as the drain depletion region extends towards the source. This increases the output current and is modeled by a multiplicative factor. The drain current $I_{D,\\mathrm{2D}}$ is:\n  - Linear Region ($0 < V_{DS} \\le V_{ov,\\mathrm{2D}}$): The equation is identical in form to the GCA model, but uses the 2D-aware parameters. CLM is not active.\n  $$I_{D,\\mathrm{2D}} = \\beta_{\\text{eff,2D}} \\left( V_{ov,\\mathrm{2D}} V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2} V_{DS}^2 \\right)$$\n  - Saturation Region ($V_{DS} > V_{ov,\\mathrm{2D}}$):\n  $$I_{D,\\mathrm{2D}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\beta_{\\text{eff,2D}} V_{ov,\\mathrm{2D}}^2 (1 + \\lambda V_{DS})$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the CLM coefficient.\n\n**3. Comparative Analysis Metrics**\nTo evaluate the GCA model against the 2D-aware reference, we compute the following for each test case:\n\n- **Relative Error**: The deviation of the GCA current from the 2D-aware reference, normalized by the reference current:\n$$\\text{Relative Error} = \\frac{I_{D,\\mathrm{GCA}} - I_{D,\\mathrm{2D}}}{I_{D,\\mathrm{2D}}}$$\nA non-zero reference current $I_{D,\\mathrm{2D}}$ is assumed. If $I_{D,\\mathrm{2D}} = 0$, then $I_{D,\\mathrm{GCA}}$ must also be $0$, and the error is defined as $0$.\n\n- **DIBL Failure Flag**: A boolean indicator that is `True` if the device is a short-channel transistor operating at high drain bias where the threshold voltage shift due to DIBL is a significant fraction of the overdrive voltage. The specific criteria are:\n$$(L \\le 100 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\land (V_{DS} \\ge 0.5\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\land \\left(\\frac{\\eta V_{DS}}{V_{ov,\\mathrm{2D}}} \\ge 0.2\\right)$$\nA positive overdrive voltage $V_{ov,\\mathrm{2D}} > 0$ is required for this evaluation.\n\n- **CLM Failure Flag**: A boolean indicator that is `True` if the device is a short-channel transistor operating in saturation, where the current increase due to CLM is non-negligible. The specific criteria are:\n$$(V_{DS} > V_{ov,\\mathrm{2D}}) \\land (\\lambda V_{DS} \\ge 0.05) \\land (L \\le 100 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})$$\nThe procedure involves, for each test case, calculating all preliminary parameters, then computing $I_{D,\\mathrm{GCA}}$ and $I_{D,\\mathrm{2D}}$ by determining their respective regions of operation, and finally evaluating the relative error and the two failure flags based on the defined criteria.",
