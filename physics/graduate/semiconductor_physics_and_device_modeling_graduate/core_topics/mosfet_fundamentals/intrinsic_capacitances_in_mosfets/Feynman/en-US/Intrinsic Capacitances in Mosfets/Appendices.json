It is a standard, scientifically grounded problem in semiconductor device physics that is well-posed and objective. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the gate oxide capacitance from first principles. We begin with Maxwell-Gauss's law and the definition of differential capacitance.\n\nThe structure described is a parallel-plate capacitor, where the top plate is the ideal gate electrode and the bottom plate is the inversion channel in the semiconductor. The dielectric material between the plates is the gate oxide with thickness $t_{ox}$ and permittivity $\\varepsilon_{ox}$.\n\nLet $Q_G$ be the total charge on the gate electrode and $\\sigma_G = Q_G/A$ be the charge per unit area on the gate, where $A = WL$ is the active area. The assumption of negligible fringing fields implies the electric field $\\vec{E}$ inside the oxide is uniform and perpendicular to the interfaces. Let the coordinate axis $y$ be directed from the semiconductor-oxide interface ($y=0$) to the gate-oxide interface ($y=t_{ox}$). The electric field points from the positive potential (gate) to the negative potential (channel) for an n-channel MOSFET in inversion, so $\\vec{E} = -E_{ox} \\hat{y}$, where $E_{ox}$ is the magnitude of the field.\n\nWe apply Maxwell-Gauss's law in its integral form, $\\oint_S \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{a} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\varepsilon_{ox}}$, to a Gaussian surface. We construct a cylindrical \"pillbox\" Gaussian surface of cross-sectional area $\\Delta A$ that encloses a portion of the gate charge. The top face of the pillbox is inside the ideal gate conductor where the electric field is zero. The bottom face is inside the oxide, just below the gate. The sides are perpendicular to the interface, so the flux through them is zero as $\\vec{E} \\perp d\\vec{a}$ on the sides. The net flux is only through the bottom face.\n\nThe flux through the bottom face is $(-E_{ox} \\hat{y}) \\cdot (-\\Delta A \\hat{y}) = E_{ox} \\Delta A$. The charge enclosed is $\\sigma_G \\Delta A$. Applying Gauss's law:\n$$E_{ox} \\Delta A = \\frac{\\sigma_G \\Delta A}{\\varepsilon_{ox}}$$\nThis gives the relationship between the electric field magnitude and the charge density:\n$$E_{ox} = \\frac{\\sigma_G}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} = \\frac{Q_G}{A \\varepsilon_{ox}}$$\n\nNext, we relate the electric field to the potential drop across the oxide, $V_{ox}$. Since the field $E_{ox}$ is uniform, the potential difference is simply the product of the field magnitude and the distance:\n$$V_{ox} = E_{ox} \\cdot t_{ox}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_{ox}$:\n$$V_{ox} = \\left(\\frac{Q_G}{A \\varepsilon_{ox}}\\right) t_{ox}$$\n\nThe total gate voltage, $V_G$ (referenced to the source, $V_{GS}$), is composed of several components. In general, $V_{GS} = V_{FB} + \\psi_s + V_{ox}$, where $V_{FB}$ is the flat-band voltage (accounting for work function differences and fixed charges) and $\\psi_s$ is the semiconductor surface potential.\n\nCapacitance is defined as the ratio of an incremental change in charge to the corresponding incremental change in applied voltage. The total intrinsic gate capacitance $C_G$ is therefore:\n$$C_G = \\frac{dQ_G}{dV_{GS}}$$\nTo evaluate this derivative, we consider the differential form of the gate voltage equation:\n$$dV_{GS} = dV_{FB} + d\\psi_s + dV_{ox}$$\nThe problem states that under the given small-signal conditions, fixed charges and work-function differences do not change, so $dV_{FB} = 0$. It also critically states that in strong inversion, the surface potential is \"effectively pinned.\" This means that an incremental change in gate voltage primarily modulates the inversion charge density, and the surface potential remains nearly constant. Therefore, we take $d\\psi_s \\approx 0$.\n\nWith these two conditions, the relationship simplifies to:\n$$dV_{GS} = dV_{ox}$$\nThis means that any small change in the applied gate voltage appears entirely across the oxide.\n\nNow we can compute the capacitance. From our earlier relation, $Q_G = \\frac{A \\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} V_{ox}$. We can differentiate $Q_G$ with respect to $V_G \\equiv V_{GS}$:\n$$C_G = \\frac{dQ_G}{dV_{GS}} = \\frac{d}{dV_{GS}} \\left(\\frac{A \\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} V_{ox}\\right)$$\nSince $dV_{GS} = dV_{ox}$, we have $\\frac{dV_{ox}}{dV_{GS}} = 1$. The total intrinsic gate capacitance is:\n$$C_G = \\frac{A \\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} \\frac{dV_{ox}}{dV_{GS}} = \\frac{A \\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}$$\nSubstituting $A=WL$:\n$$C_G = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox} W L}{t_{ox}}$$\n\nThe first quantity requested is the oxide capacitance per unit area, typically denoted as $C'_{ox}$. This is obtained by dividing the total capacitance $C_G$ by the area $A$:\n$$C'_{ox} = \\frac{C_G}{A} = \\frac{1}{A} \\left(\\frac{A \\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}\\right) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}$$\nThis expression represents the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor with unit area.\n\nThe second quantity is the total intrinsic gate capacitance, which we have already derived as:\n$$C_G = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox} W L}{t_{ox}}$$\nThis derivation relies solely on the stated first principles and the simplifying assumptions provided in the problem. The result is a closed-form expression in terms of the given parameters. The two requested quantities are $C'_{ox}$ and $C_G$.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard pedagogical exercise in MOSFET device physics to demonstrate a known limitation of the Meyer capacitance model. All provided data and conditions are consistent and sufficient to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Gate Self-Capacitance in Saturation\n\nWe are asked to derive the small-signal gate self-capacitance $C_{gg} = \\partial Q_g / \\partial V_g$ in the saturation regime. The problem states that we can neglect the variation of depletion charge, so any change in gate charge $Q_g$ is equal and opposite to the change in inversion charge $Q_{inv}$. Therefore, $Q_g \\approx -Q_{inv}$ (in magnitude, the total charge sums to zero, $Q_g + Q_{inv} + Q_{dep} = 0$, so if $Q_{dep}$ is constant, $\\partial Q_g / \\partial V_g = -\\partial Q_{inv} / \\partial V_g$). By convention, inversion charge $Q_{inv}$ is negative for an n-channel MOSFET. We will work with its magnitude, $|Q_{inv}|$.\n\nUnder the gradual channel approximation, the inversion charge density per unit length at a position $y$ along the channel (from source at $y=0$ to drain at $y=L$) is given by:\n$$\n|Q'_{inv}(y)| = W C_{ox} [V_{gs} - V_{th} - V(y)]\n$$\nwhere $W$ is the channel width, $C_{ox} = \\varepsilon_{ox} / t_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $V_{gs}$ is the gate-to-source voltage, $V_{th}$ is the threshold voltage, and $V(y)$ is the channel potential at position $y$.\n\nThe total magnitude of the inversion charge is the integral of this density along the channel length:\n$$\n|Q_{inv}| = \\int_0^L |Q'_{inv}(y)| \\, dy = W C_{ox} \\int_0^L [V_{gs} - V_{th} - V(y)] \\, dy\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we need to relate $dy$ to $dV$. The drift current in the channel is constant and given by $I_{ds} = |Q'_{inv}(y)| v(y)$, where $v(y) = \\mu_n E(y) = \\mu_n \\frac{dV}{dy}$ is the electron drift velocity.\n$$\nI_{ds} = W C_{ox} [V_{gs} - V_{th} - V(y)] \\mu_n \\frac{dV}{dy}\n$$\nSince the device is in saturation, the current is $I_{ds,sat}$. We can rearrange and integrate this expression to find the standard saturation current. In saturation, the channel is pinched off at the drain, which occurs when the local gate-to-channel voltage equals $V_{th}$. In the simple model, this happens at a channel potential of $V_{ds,sat} = V_{gs} - V_{th}$.\n$$\nI_{ds,sat} \\int_0^L dy = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\int_0^{V_{ds,sat}} [V_{gs} - V_{th} - V] \\, dV\n$$\n$$\nI_{ds,sat} L = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left[ (V_{gs}-V_{th})V - \\frac{V^2}{2} \\right]_0^{V_{gs}-V_{th}} = \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{ox}}{2} (V_{gs}-V_{th})^2\n$$\nNow we return to the total charge integral. We express $dy$ in terms of $dV$ using the current equation:\n$$\ndy = \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{ox}}{I_{ds,sat}} [V_{gs} - V_{th} - V] \\, dV\n$$\nSubstituting this into the integral for $|Q_{inv}|$:\n$$\n|Q_{inv}| = W C_{ox} \\int_0^{V_{ds,sat}} [V_{gs} - V_{th} - V] \\left( \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{ox}}{I_{ds,sat}} [V_{gs} - V_{th} - V] \\right) dV\n$$\n$$\n|Q_{inv}| = \\frac{W^2 \\mu_n C_{ox}^2}{I_{ds,sat}} \\int_0^{V_{gs}-V_{th}} [V_{gs} - V_{th} - V]^2 dV\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $I_{ds,sat} = \\frac{W \\mu_n C_{ox}}{2L}(V_{gs}-V_{th})^2$:\n$$\n|Q_{inv}| = \\frac{W^2 \\mu_n C_{ox}^2}{\\frac{W \\mu_n C_{ox}}{2L}(V_{gs}-V_{th})^2} \\left[ -\\frac{(V_{gs} - V_{th} - V)^3}{3} \\right]_0^{V_{gs}-V_{th}}\n$$\n$$\n|Q_{inv}| = \\frac{2WL C_{ox}}{(V_{gs}-V_{th})^2} \\left[ 0 - \\left( -\\frac{(V_{gs} - V_{th})^3}{3} \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n|Q_{inv}| = \\frac{2WL C_{ox}}{(V_{gs}-V_{th})^2} \\frac{(V_{gs} - V_{th})^3}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} WL C_{ox} (V_{gs} - V_{th})\n$$\nThe gate charge is $Q_g = |Q_{inv}|$. Given $V_s=0$, $V_{gs}=V_g$. The overdrive voltage is $V_{ov} = V_g - V_{th}$.\n$$\nQ_g(V_g) = \\frac{2}{3} WL C_{ox} (V_g - V_{th}) = \\frac{2}{3} WL C_{ox} V_{ov}\n$$\nThe gate self-capacitance is the derivative of $Q_g$ with respect to $V_g$:\n$$\nC_{gg} = \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_g} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_g} \\left[ \\frac{2}{3} WL C_{ox} (V_g - V_{th}) \\right] = \\frac{2}{3} WL C_{ox}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Analysis of the Meyer Model and Charge Conservation\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the column sum $\\Sigma_g = C_{gg} + C_{dg} + C_{sg} + C_{bg}$ using a specified set of \"Meyer modeling assumptions\".\nThe assumptions for a MOSFET in saturation are:\n1. $C_{gd} = 0$ (gate-drain capacitance is zero due to pinch-off).\n2. $C_{gb} = 0$ (gate-body capacitance is neglected, especially with body tied to source).\n3. Reciprocity for off-diagonal capacitances: $C_{dg} = C_{gd}$, $C_{sg} = C_{gs}$, $C_{bg} = C_{gb}$.\n4. Gate capacitance partitioning: $C_{gg} = C_{gs} + C_{gd} + C_{gb}$.\n\nFrom these assumptions, we can determine the components of $\\Sigma_g$.\n- From assumption 1 and 3: $C_{dg} = C_{gd} = 0$.\n- From assumption 2 and 3: $C_{bg} = C_{gb} = 0$.\n- From assumption 4, combined with 1 and 2, we find a relation for $C_{gs}$:\n  $$\n  C_{gg} = C_{gs} + 0 + 0 \\implies C_{gs} = C_{gg}\n  $$\n- From assumption 3, we have $C_{sg} = C_{gs}$. Therefore, $C_{sg} = C_{gg}$.\n\nNow we can compute the sum $\\Sigma_g$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_g = C_{gg} + C_{dg} + C_{sg} + C_{bg} = C_{gg} + 0 + C_{sg} + 0 = C_{gg} + C_{sg}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_{sg} = C_{gg}$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_g = C_{gg} + C_{gg} = 2C_{gg}\n$$\nUsing the result from Part 1 for $C_{gg}$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_g = 2 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} WL C_{ox} \\right) = \\frac{4}{3} WL C_{ox}\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for $\\Sigma_g$ under the given assumptions.\n\nA non-zero value for $\\Sigma_g$ indicates a violation of charge conservation. The principle of charge conservation requires that the total charge of the isolated MOSFET system is constant (or zero, if it is neutral). Let $Q_{tot} = Q_g + Q_d + Q_s + Q_b$. Then $Q_{tot}$ must be a constant, independent of terminal voltages. Taking the partial derivative with respect to any terminal voltage, say $V_j$, must yield zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q_{tot}}{\\partial V_j} = \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_j} + \\frac{\\partial Q_d}{\\partial V_j} + \\frac{\\partial Q_s}{\\partial V_j} + \\frac{\\partial Q_b}{\\partial V_j} = 0\n$$\nBy definition, $C_{ij} = \\partial Q_i / \\partial V_j$. Thus, for any column $j$ of the capacitance matrix, the sum of its elements must be zero:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in \\{g,d,s,b\\}} C_{ij} = 0\n$$\nThe sum we evaluated, $\\Sigma_g$, is the sum of the column corresponding to $j=g$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_g = C_{gg} + C_{dg} + C_{sg} + C_{bg}\n$$\nOur derived result, $\\Sigma_g = \\frac{4}{3} WL C_{ox}$, is clearly non-zero. This demonstrates that the set of assumptions provided, which are characteristic of the simple Meyer model, is not self-consistent and fails to conserve charge. This is a well-known deficiency of the Meyer model, which led to the development of more sophisticated, charge-conserving models.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe compute the numerical value of $\\Sigma_g = \\frac{4}{3} WL C_{ox}$.\nFirst, we calculate the oxide capacitance per unit area, $C_{ox}$.\nGiven parameters:\n- $W = 10\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}$\n- $L = 1\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}$\n- $t_{ox} = 3\\ \\text{nm} = 3 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}$\n- $\\varepsilon_{ox} = 3.9\\,\\varepsilon_{0}$\n- $\\varepsilon_{0} = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F/m}$\n\nThe oxide permittivity is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{ox} = 3.9 \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F/m}) \\approx 3.45306 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{F/m}\n$$\nThe oxide capacitance per unit area is:\n$$\nC_{ox} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} = \\frac{3.45306 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{F/m}}{3 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}} \\approx 1.15102 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\text{F/m}^2\n$$\nThe total gate oxide capacitance is $W \\times L \\times C_{ox}$:\n$$\nW L C_{ox} = (10 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}) \\times (1.15102 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\text{F/m}^2)\n$$\n$$\nW L C_{ox} = (10 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{m}^2) \\times (1.15102 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\text{F/m}^2) \\approx 1.15102 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\text{F}\n$$\nNow, we can compute $\\Sigma_g$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_g = \\frac{4}{3} WL C_{ox} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times (1.15102 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\text{F}) \\approx 1.53469 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\text{F}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result in femtofarads ($1\\ \\text{fF} = 10^{-15}\\ \\text{F}$), rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\Sigma_g \\approx 1.53469 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\text{F} = 153.469 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\text{F} = 153.469\\ \\text{fF}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $153\\ \\text{fF}$.",

Assume gate voltage steps are ideal, so capacitors to the gate node act as capacitors to a fixed-voltage node during each edge.\n- For the Meyer model in saturation, set the channel-related gate-to-drain capacitance of the active device to zero and include only its gate-to-drain overlap capacitance. For the Ward–Dutton model in saturation, include a nonzero fraction of the channel gate capacitance in the gate-to-drain path due to charge partition; use a linear partition factor consistent with long-channel behavior so that a fraction is assigned to the drain in saturation.\n- The characteristic time constant is $\\tau = R_{\\mathrm{on}} \\, C_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. For a first-order RC response, the $10\\%$ to $90\\%$ rise time or $90\\%$ to $10\\%$ fall time equals $\\tau \\ln(9)$.\n\nDefinitions and parameter use:\n- The oxide capacitance per unit area is $C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ in $\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\n- The channel gate capacitance of a device is $C_{\\mathrm{ch}} = C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\, W \\, L$.\n- Gate-to-drain overlap capacitances $C_{\\mathrm{ov},n}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{ov},p}$ are given directly for NMOS and PMOS, respectively.\n- Drain-bulk junction capacitances $C_{j,n}$ and $C_{j,p}$ are given directly for NMOS and PMOS, respectively.\n- External load capacitance at the output node is $C_{L}$.\n- On-resistances $R_{n}$ and $R_{p}$ model the conduction path of NMOS (during output falling) and PMOS (during output rising), respectively.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each test case, parameters are provided as a tuple:\n$(W_{n}, L_{n}, W_{p}, L_{p}, C_{\\mathrm{ox}}, C_{\\mathrm{ov},n}, C_{\\mathrm{ov},p}, C_{j,n}, C_{j,p}, C_{L}, R_{n}, R_{p})$\nwith units $(\\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}, \\mathrm{F}, \\mathrm{F}, \\mathrm{F}, \\mathrm{F}, \\mathrm{F}, \\Omega, \\Omega)$.\n\nUse a Ward–Dutton saturation drain partition fraction of $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\frac{1}{3}$ of the channel gate capacitance assigned to the gate-to-drain path during saturation. For Meyer in saturation, use $0$ for the channel gate-to-drain contribution. Always add the respective gate-to-drain overlap capacitance of the active device and the gate-to-drain overlap of the inactive device to the output node load during the corresponding edge.\n\nCompute the following for each test case:\n- $t_{\\mathrm{rise,Meyer}} = R_{p} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{eff,rise,Meyer}} \\cdot \\ln(9)$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{fall,Meyer}} = R_{n} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{eff,fall,Meyer}} \\cdot \\ln(9)$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{rise,WD}} = R_{p} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{eff,rise,WD}} \\cdot \\ln(9)$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{fall,WD}} = R_{n} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{eff,fall,WD}} \\cdot \\ln(9)$\n\nWhere, for each edge, $C_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ aggregates:\n- The external load $C_{L}$,\n- The junction capacitances $C_{j,n} + C_{j,p}$,\n- The gate-to-drain coupling of the active device per the chosen model,\n- The gate-to-drain overlap of the inactive device.\n\nTest cases to implement:\n1. $(1.0\\times 10^{-6}, 1.8\\times 10^{-7}, 2.0\\times 10^{-6}, 1.8\\times 10^{-7}, 1.0\\times 10^{-2}, 2.0\\times 10^{-16}, 2.5\\times 10^{-16}, 7.0\\times 10^{-16}, 8.0\\times 10^{-16}, 2.0\\times 10^{-15}, 8.0\\times 10^{3}, 1.0\\times 10^{4})$\n2. $(5.0\\times 10^{-7}, 4.0\\times 10^{-8}, 1.0\\times 10^{-6}, 4.0\\times 10^{-8}, 1.0\\times 10^{-2}, 2.5\\times 10^{-16}, 2.5\\times 10^{-16}, 5.0\\times 10^{-16}, 5.0\\times 10^{-16}, 1.0\\times 10^{-15}, 1.2\\times 10^{4}, 1.5\\times 10^{4})$\n3. $(2.0\\times 10^{-5}, 1.8\\times 10^{-7}, 4.0\\times 10^{-5}, 1.8\\times 10^{-7}, 1.0\\times 10^{-2}, 3.0\\times 10^{-15}, 4.0\\times 10^{-15}, 3.0\\times 10^{-15}, 3.0\\times 10^{-15}, 5.0\\times 10^{-15}, 1.0\\times 10^{3}, 1.2\\times 10^{3})$\n4. $(8.0\\times 10^{-7}, 1.2\\times 10^{-7}, 2.0\\times 10^{-6}, 1.2\\times 10^{-7}, 1.0\\times 10^{-2}, 1.8\\times 10^{-16}, 2.2\\times 10^{-16}, 6.0\\times 10^{-16}, 6.0\\times 10^{-16}, 1.5\\times 10^{-15}, 2.0\\times 10^{4}, 5.0\\times 10^{3})$\n\nFinal output specification:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of semiconductor device physics and circuit theory, specifically concerning MOSFET capacitance modeling and transient analysis of CMOS digital circuits. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear, objective methodology for calculating the required quantities. The provided physical parameters are realistic for modern CMOS technologies.\n\nThe central task is to compute the rise and fall times of a CMOS inverter output, contrasting the predictions of the non-charge-conserving Meyer capacitance model with the charge-conserving Ward–Dutton model. The analysis is based on a first-order RC delay model.\n\nThe $10\\%$ to $90\\%$ rise or $90\\%$ to $10\\%$ fall time, $t_{\\mathrm{transient}}$, for a first-order system is given by:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{transient}} = \\tau \\ln(9) $$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the time constant of the system. For the CMOS inverter, $\\tau$ is the product of the effective on-resistance of the active transistor, $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and the total effective capacitance at the output node, $C_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n$$ \\tau = R_{\\mathrm{on}} C_{\\mathrm{eff}} $$\n\nWe must determine $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for each of the four scenarios: rise and fall transitions, each analyzed with two different capacitance models.\n\n**1. Output Rise Transition ($t_{\\mathrm{rise}}$)**\nDuring the output rise, the input transitions from high to low. The pull-up PMOS transistor turns on, and the pull-down NMOS transistor turns off.\n- The active transistor is the PMOS. The relevant on-resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{on}} = R_{p}$.\n- The inactive transistor is the NMOS.\n- This transition is modeled assuming the PMOS is in saturation at the beginning of the switching event (when the output is low and the PMOS gate is low).\n\n**2. Output Fall Transition ($t_{\\mathrm{fall}}$)**\nDuring the output fall, the input transitions from low to high. The pull-down NMOS transistor turns on, and the pull-up PMOS transistor turns off.\n- The active transistor is the NMOS. The relevant on-resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{on}} = R_{n}$.\n- The inactive transistor is the PMOS.\n- This transition is modeled assuming the NMOS is in saturation at the beginning of the switching event (when the output is high and the NMOS gate is high).\n\n**3. Effective Capacitance ($C_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) Formulation**\nThe problem specifies that the total effective capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ at the output node is the sum of several components:\n1.  The external load capacitance, $C_{L}$.\n2.  The total drain-to-bulk junction capacitance of both transistors, $C_{j, \\mathrm{total}} = C_{j,n} + C_{j,p}$.\n3.  The gate-to-drain coupling capacitance of the **active** device, $C_{gd, \\mathrm{active}}$, which depends on the chosen model (Meyer or Ward-Dutton).\n4.  The gate-to-drain overlap capacitance of the **inactive** device, $C_{\\mathrm{ov}, \\mathrm{inactive}}$. Since the inactive device is off, its channel-related capacitances are zero, and its only gate-to-drain coupling is through the overlap capacitance.\n\nThus, the general expression for $C_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ during a rise transition (PMOS active, NMOS inactive) is:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{eff,rise}} = C_{L} + C_{j,n} + C_{j,p} + C_{gd,p} + C_{\\mathrm{ov},n} $$\nAnd for a fall transition (NMOS active, PMOS inactive):\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{eff,fall}} = C_{L} + C_{j,n} + C_{j,p} + C_{gd,n} + C_{\\mathrm{ov},p} $$\n\nThe gate-to-drain capacitance of a MOSFET is the sum of its physical overlap component and its channel-charge-related component: $C_{gd} = C_{\\mathrm{ov}} + C_{gd,\\mathrm{channel}}$. The models differ in their treatment of $C_{gd,\\mathrm{channel}}$ for the active transistor in saturation.\n\n**Meyer Model:** This is a non-charge-conserving model which, in its simplest form, asserts that the gate-to-drain channel capacitance in saturation is zero.\n$$ C_{gd,\\mathrm{channel}} = 0 \\quad (\\text{in saturation}) $$\nTherefore, for the active device, $C_{gd, \\mathrm{active}} = C_{\\mathrm{ov}, \\mathrm{active}}$.\n\n**Ward–Dutton (WD) Model:** This is a charge-conserving model. It correctly partitions the channel charge between the source and drain terminals. In saturation, a portion of the total channel charge is still controlled by the drain potential. For a long-channel device, the gate-to-drain channel capacitance is approximated as a fraction of the total gate-to-channel capacitance, $C_{\\mathrm{ch}} = C_{\\mathrm{ox}}WL$. The problem specifies a partition fraction $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n$$ C_{gd,\\mathrm{channel}} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{sat}} C_{\\mathrm{ch}} = \\frac{1}{3} C_{\\mathrm{ox}} W L \\quad (\\text{in saturation}) $$\nTherefore, for the active device, $C_{gd, \\mathrm{active}} = C_{\\mathrm{ov}, \\mathrm{active}} + \\frac{1}{3} C_{\\mathrm{ch}, \\mathrm{active}}$.\n\n**4. Final Expressions for Transient Times**\n\nLet's define a base capacitance, $C_{\\mathrm{base}}$, that is common to all scenarios:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{base}} = C_{L} + C_{j,n} + C_{j,p} + C_{\\mathrm{ov},n} + C_{\\mathrm{ov},p} $$\nThis capacitance includes the external load, all junction capacitances, and all overlap capacitances.\n\n**For the Meyer model:**\nThe gate-to-drain coupling of the active device is simply its overlap capacitance.\n- For the rise time (PMOS active), $C_{\\mathrm{eff,rise,Meyer}} = C_{L} + C_{j,n} + C_{j,p} + C_{\\mathrm{ov},p} + C_{\\mathrm{ov},n} = C_{\\mathrm{base}}$.\n- For the fall time (NMOS active), $C_{\\mathrm{eff,fall,Meyer}} = C_{L} + C_{j,n} + C_{j,p} + C_{\\mathrm{ov},n} + C_{\\mathrm{ov},p} = C_{\\mathrm{base}}$.\nThe resulting transient times are:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{rise,Meyer}} = R_{p} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{base}} \\cdot \\ln(9) $$\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{fall,Meyer}} = R_{n} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{base}} \\cdot \\ln(9) $$\n\n**For the Ward-Dutton model:**\nThe gate-to-drain coupling of the active device includes a channel partitioning term.\n- For the rise time (PMOS active), we add the PMOS channel contribution. Let $C_{\\mathrm{ch},p} = C_{\\mathrm{ox}} W_p L_p$.\n$C_{\\mathrm{eff,rise,WD}} = C_{\\mathrm{base}} + \\frac{1}{3} C_{\\mathrm{ch},p}$.\n- For the fall time (NMOS active), we add the NMOS channel contribution. Let $C_{\\mathrm{ch},n} = C_{\\mathrm{ox}} W_n L_n$.\n$C_{\\mathrm{eff,fall,WD}} = C_{\\mathrm{base}} + \\frac{1}{3} C_{\\mathrm{ch},n}$.\nThe resulting transient times are:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{rise,WD}} = R_{p} \\cdot \\left( C_{\\mathrm{base}} + \\frac{1}{3} C_{\\mathrm{ox}} W_p L_p \\right) \\cdot \\ln(9) $$\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{fall,WD}} = R_{n} \\cdot \\left( C_{\\mathrm{base}} + \\frac{1}{3} C_{\\mathrm{ox}} W_n L_n \\right) \\cdot \\ln(9) $$\n\nThese formulas will be implemented to compute the numerical solutions for the given test cases. The Ward-Dutton model, by accounting for the additional charge partitioning, is expected to predict a larger effective capacitance and thus longer, more realistic switching times compared to the simpler Meyer model.",
