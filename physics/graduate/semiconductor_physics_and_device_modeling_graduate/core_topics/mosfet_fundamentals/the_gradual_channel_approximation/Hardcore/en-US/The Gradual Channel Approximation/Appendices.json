            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in semiconductor physics, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive the requested quantities. The Gradual Channel Approximation (GCA) and the depletion approximation are standard, well-defined models in the analysis of long-channel MOSFETs.\n\nWe begin with Poisson’s equation, which relates the electrostatic potential $\\psi$ to the space charge density $\\rho$. The problem states that due to the Gradual Channel Approximation (GCA), the potential varies slowly along the channel (the $x$-direction), allowing us to treat the electrostatics in the vertical direction (the $y$-direction) as a one-dimensional problem at any given position $x$. Thus, Poisson's equation in the semiconductor is written as:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi(y,x)}{dy^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(y,x)}{\\varepsilon_s} $$\nThe problem specifies the use of the depletion approximation for the charge density in the p-type substrate. The space charge consists of ionized acceptor atoms, which are negatively charged.\n$$ \\rho(y,x) = -qN_A \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le y \\le W_d(x) $$\n$$ \\rho(y,x) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } y  W_d(x) $$\nHere, $q$ is the elementary charge, $N_A$ is the acceptor doping concentration, and $W_d(x)$ is the local depletion width.\n\nSubstituting the charge density into Poisson's equation for the depletion region ($0 \\le y \\le W_d(x)$):\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi(y,x)}{dy^2} = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} $$\nTo find the vertical electric field, $E_y(y,x) = -\\frac{d\\psi(y,x)}{dy}$, we integrate the above equation with respect to $y$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\psi(y,x)}{dy} = \\int \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} dy = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} y + C_1(x) $$\nTherefore, the electric field is:\n$$ E_y(y,x) = -\\frac{d\\psi(y,x)}{dy} = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} y - C_1(x) $$\nThe integration constant $C_1(x)$ is determined by applying a boundary condition. At the edge of the depletion region, $y=W_d(x)$, the semiconductor becomes electrically neutral, which implies that the electric field must vanish.\nBoundary Condition 1: $E_y(y=W_d(x), x) = 0$.\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} W_d(x) - C_1(x) \\implies C_1(x) = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} W_d(x) $$\nSubstituting $C_1(x)$ back into the expression for the electric field:\n$$ E_y(y,x) = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} y - \\left(-\\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} W_d(x)\\right) = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} (W_d(x) - y) $$\nThis expression is valid for $0 \\le y \\le W_d(x)$.\n\nNext, we find the potential $\\psi(y,x)$ by integrating $-\\frac{d\\psi}{dy} = E_y(y,x)$ with respect to $y$:\n$$ \\psi(y,x) = \\int -E_y(y,x) dy = \\int -\\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} (W_d(x) - y) dy $$\n$$ \\psi(y,x) = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left(W_d(x)y - \\frac{y^2}{2}\\right) + C_2(x) $$\nTo find the second integration constant $C_2(x)$, we apply a boundary condition on the potential. The problem states that the potential in the bulk (far from the surface) is zero. We can set the reference potential at the edge of the depletion region, which is the interface with the neutral bulk.\nBoundary Condition 2: $\\psi(y=W_d(x), x) = 0$.\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left(W_d(x)^2 - \\frac{W_d(x)^2}{2}\\right) + C_2(x) = -\\frac{qN_A}{2\\varepsilon_s} W_d(x)^2 + C_2(x) $$\n$$ \\implies C_2(x) = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\varepsilon_s} W_d(x)^2 $$\nSubstituting $C_2(x)$ back into the expression for the potential:\n$$ \\psi(y,x) = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left(W_d(x)y - \\frac{y^2}{2}\\right) + \\frac{qN_A}{2\\varepsilon_s} W_d(x)^2 $$\n$$ \\psi(y,x) = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\varepsilon_s} \\left( W_d(x)^2 - 2W_d(x)y + y^2 \\right) = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\varepsilon_s} (W_d(x) - y)^2 $$\n\nThe first task is to find the depletion width $W_d(x)$ as a function of the surface potential $\\psi_s(x)$. The surface potential is defined as the potential at the silicon surface, $y=0$.\n$$ \\psi_s(x) = \\psi(0,x) = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\varepsilon_s} (W_d(x) - 0)^2 = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\varepsilon_s} W_d(x)^2 $$\nSolving for $W_d(x)$:\n$$ W_d(x)^2 = \\frac{2\\varepsilon_s \\psi_s(x)}{qN_A} $$\nSince the depletion width must be a positive quantity, we take the positive square root. For a p-type substrate in depletion, the surface potential $\\psi_s(x)$ is positive, so the argument of the square root is real and positive.\n$$ W_d(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_s \\psi_s(x)}{qN_A}} $$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nThe second task is to find the magnitude of the vertical electric field at the surface, $|E_y(0,x)|$. We use our previously derived expression for $E_y(y,x)$ and evaluate it at $y=0$:\n$$ E_y(0,x) = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} (W_d(x) - 0) = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} W_d(x) $$\nThe problem requires this expression to be in terms of $q$, $N_A$, $\\varepsilon_s$, and $\\psi_s(x)$. We substitute the expression for $W_d(x)$:\n$$ E_y(0,x) = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_s \\psi_s(x)}{qN_A}} $$\nTo simplify, we bring the term outside the square root inside:\n$$ E_y(0,x) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_s}\\right)^2 \\frac{2\\varepsilon_s \\psi_s(x)}{qN_A}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{q^2 N_A^2}{\\varepsilon_s^2} \\frac{2\\varepsilon_s \\psi_s(x)}{qN_A}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 q N_A \\psi_s(x)}{\\varepsilon_s}} $$\nSince all quantities under the square root are positive, the electric field $E_y(0,x)$ is positive. The field points from the surface into the substrate, which is consistent with the coordinate system ($E_y = -\\frac{d\\psi}{dy}$, and $\\psi$ decreases away from the surface). The magnitude is therefore:\n$$ |E_y(0,x)| = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 q N_A \\psi_s(x)}{\\varepsilon_s}} $$\nThis is the second required expression.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of semiconductor device physics, specifically the Gradual Channel Approximation (GCA) for MOSFETs. The problem is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, providing all necessary conditions and definitions to derive the requested result without ambiguity. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins by establishing the fundamental equations governing charge and transport in the channel of an n-MOSFET under the GCA.\n\n**1. Definitions and Sign Conventions**\n\nFirst, we define our coordinate system and variables as required.\n- Let the coordinate along the channel be denoted by $x$, with the source located at $x=0$ and the drain at $x=L$.\n- The electrostatic potential in the channel at position $x$ relative to the grounded source is $V(x)$. Thus, $V(0)=0$ and the drain-to-source voltage is $V_{DS} = V(L)$.\n- The gate-to-source voltage, $V_{GS}$, and the threshold voltage, $V_T$, are taken as constants.\n- The mobile inversion charge density (charge per unit area) at a point $x$ is denoted by $Q_i(x)$. For an n-channel device, the carriers are electrons, so $Q_i(x)$ is a negative quantity.\n- The drain current, $I_D$, is the conventional current flowing from the drain to the source. Since electrons flow from source to drain (in the $+x$ direction), this corresponds to a positive value for $I_D$.\n\n**2. Inversion Charge Density from Gauss's Law**\n\nThe Gradual Channel Approximation assumes that the electric field perpendicular to the surface (the vertical field) is much larger than the field parallel to the surface (the lateral field). This allows for a one-dimensional treatment of the electrostatics in the direction perpendicular to the channel.\n\nUnder the charge-sheet approximation, the mobile charge in the inversion layer is treated as a sheet of charge at the semiconductor-oxide interface. Gauss's law applied to a small pillbox straddling this interface relates the charge in the semiconductor to the voltage across the oxide. The voltage across the oxide layer at a position $x$ along the channel is the difference between the gate potential, $V_{GS}$, and the local channel potential, $V(x)$.\n\nThe inversion layer forms when the local gate-to-channel voltage, $V_{GS} - V(x)$, is sufficient to both offset the flat-band and depletion effects (accounted for by $V_T$) and attract mobile carriers. The amount of inversion charge is therefore proportional to the effective \"overdrive\" voltage, $V_{GS} - V(x) - V_T$.\n\nGiven the oxide capacitance per unit area, $C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, the inversion charge density is given by:\n$$\nQ_i(x) = -C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{GS} - V_T - V(x))\n$$\nThe negative sign is explicit because the mobile carriers are electrons. This equation is valid for the quasi-neutral conducting channel, i.e., where $V_{GS} - V_T - V(x) \\geq 0$. If this condition is not met, there is no inversion layer, and $Q_i(x) = 0$.\n\n**3. Drift Current in the Channel**\n\nThe drain current $I_D$ arises from the drift of mobile carriers in the inversion layer under the influence of the lateral electric field, $E_x(x) = -\\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$.\nThe drift velocity of the electrons is given by $v_e(x)$:\n$$\nv_e(x) = -\\mu_n E_x(x) = \\mu_n \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_n$ is the constant electron mobility.\n\nIn steady state, the continuity equation demands that the current $I_D$ be constant at every position $x$ along the channel. The current is the product of the total mobile charge per unit length, $W \\times Q_i(x)$ (where $W$ is the channel width), and the electron velocity, multiplied by $-1$ to convert from electron current to conventional current.\n$$\nI_D = - (W Q_i(x)) v_e(x)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $Q_i(x)$ and $v_e(x)$:\n$$\nI_D = - W \\left[ -C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{GS} - V_T - V(x)) \\right] \\left[ \\mu_n \\frac{dV(x)}{dx} \\right]\n$$\nThis simplifies to the fundamental differential equation for the channel potential under the GCA:\n$$\nI_D = W \\mu_n C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{GS} - V_T - V(x)) \\frac{dV(x)}{dx}\n$$\n\n**4. Justification of the Potential Plateau at Pinch-Off**\n\nThe problem requires an argument for the emergence of a potential plateau based on the coexistence of vanishing inversion charge (pinch-off) and constant current flow.\n\nPinch-off is defined as the condition where the inversion layer just disappears. This occurs at a point along the channel, let's call it $x_p$, where the charge density $Q_i(x_p)$ goes to zero. From our charge equation, this implies:\n$$\nQ_i(x_p) = -C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{GS} - V_T - V(x_p)) = 0\n$$\nThis condition is met when the potential at that point, $V(x_p)$, reaches a specific value. Let us call this value the plateau voltage, $V_{plateau}$.\n$$\nV_{plateau} = V(x_p) = V_{GS} - V_T\n$$\nThis is the value we seek to derive, but first we must justify the term \"plateau\". Let's analyze the current equation near this pinch-off point. We can rearrange it to solve for the electric field, $\\frac{dV}{dx}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dV(x)}{dx} = \\frac{I_D}{W \\mu_n C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{GS} - V_T - V(x))}\n$$\nThe problem states that the current $I_D$ remains constant along the channel. As the local potential $V(x)$ approaches the pinch-off value $V_{plateau} = V_{GS} - V_T$, the denominator of the expression for $\\frac{dV}{dx}$ approaches zero.\n$$\n\\lim_{V(x) \\to V_{plateau}^{-}} \\frac{dV(x)}{dx} \\to \\infty\n$$\nThis means that in order to sustain a finite, constant current $I_D$ with a vanishing density of carriers ($Q_i(x) \\to 0$), the carrier velocity $v_e(x)$ must approach infinity. Within our constant mobility model, this implies the lateral electric field $E_x(x)$ must also approach infinity.\n\nThis theoretical infinity signifies the breakdown of the GCA. In reality, a very high field region forms. When the drain voltage $V_{DS}$ is increased to a value greater than $V_{plateau}$, the pinch-off point $x_p$ moves slightly away from the drain into the channel ($x_p  L$). The portion of the channel from $x=0$ to $x=x_p$ remains conductive, and the potential at $x_p$ is fixed at $V_{plateau} = V_{GS} - V_T$. The additional voltage, $V_{DS} - V_{plateau}$, is dropped across the newly formed, carrier-depleted region between $x_p$ and the drain at $x=L$.\n\nBecause the potential at the end of the conductive channel is now \"pinned\" or \"stuck\" at the value $V_{plateau}$ regardless of further increases in $V_{DS}$ (for $V_{DS} > V_{plateau}$), this value acts as a voltage plateau. Since the voltage drop across the conducting part of the channel remains essentially constant, the current $I_D$ saturates. The \"plateau\" is therefore the saturation voltage at the channel end, which remains fixed even as the overall drain-to-source voltage increases.\n\n**5. Derivation of the Plateau Voltage**\n\nThe derivation of the plateau voltage value follows directly from the definition of pinch-off. The quasi-neutral inversion region, where mobile charge carriers exist to support current, is defined by the condition $Q_i(x) \\neq 0$. This requires:\n$$\nV_{GS} - V_T - V(x) > 0\n$$\nThe edge of this region is the point where this inequality becomes an equality. The potential at this boundary point is the plateau voltage, $V_{plateau}$. We set the term to zero:\n$$\nV_{GS} - V_T - V_{plateau} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $V_{plateau}$ gives the final expression:\n$$\nV_{plateau} = V_{GS} - V_T\n$$\nThis result represents the potential at the drain-end of the conducting channel when the transistor enters the saturation regime. It is a function only of the gate-to-source voltage and the threshold voltage, as required.",

The ideal drain current $I_{D,sat}$ is independent of $V_{DS}$ and is given by:\n    $$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{th})^2$$\n    where $\\mu_n$ is the electron mobility, $C_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $W$ is the channel width, $L$ is the channel length, $V_{GS}$ is the gate-to-source voltage, and $V_{th}$ is the threshold voltage.\n\n2.  **Channel-Length Modulation (CLM)**\n    In reality, for $V_{DS}  V_{GS} - V_{th}$, the pinch-off point at the drain end of the channel begins to move towards the source.

The drain current now depends on $V_{DS}$ through its effect on $\\Delta L$.\n    The drain current including CLM is:\n    $$I_D = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L_{\\text{eff}}} (V_{GS} - V_{th})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L - \\Delta L(V_{DS})} (V_{GS} - V_{th})^2$$\n    This can be related to the ideal saturation current as:\n    $$I_D = I_{D,sat} \\frac{L}{L - \\Delta L(V_{DS})}$$\n    For a long-channel device, $\\Delta L \\ll L$, so we can use the Taylor approximation $\\frac{1}{1-x} \\approx 1+x$:\n    $$I_D \\approx I_{D,sat} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\Delta L(V_{DS})}{L} \\right)$$\n\n3.  **Extraction of $\\lambda$ from Experimental Data**\n    A widely used empirical model for the drain current in saturation is:\n    $$I_D = I_{D,sat}' (1 + \\lambda V_{DS})$$\n    where $I_{D,sat}'$ is the current extrapolated to $V_{DS}=0$. The finite slope of the $I_D$–$V_{DS}$ curve in saturation is the output conductance, $g_{ds}$:\n    $$g_{ds} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\right|_{V_{GS}=\\text{const}} = \\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}V_{DS}} [I_{D,sat}' (1 + \\lambda V_{DS})] = \\lambda I_{D,sat}'$$\n    Since $I_D \\approx I_{D,sat}'$ in the saturation region (for small $\\lambda V_{DS}$), we can approximate the channel-length modulation parameter $\\lambda$ as:\n    $$\\lambda \\approx \\frac{1}{I_D} g_{ds} = \\frac{1}{I_D} \\left. \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\right|_{V_{GS}=\\text{const}}$$\n    This provides a direct method to extract $\\lambda$ from the measured slope of the $I_D$–$V_{DS}$ characteristic in saturation.\n\n4.  **Physical Model for $\\lambda$**\n    To connect $\\lambda$ to fundamental device parameters, we differentiate the physics-based expression for $I_D$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{DS}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\left[ I_{D,sat} \\frac{L}{L - \\Delta L} \\right] = I_{D,sat} L \\left( -1 \\cdot (L - \\Delta L)^{-2} \\cdot (-\\frac{\\partial \\Delta L}{\\partial V_{DS}}) \\right) = \\frac{I_D}{L - \\Delta L} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta L}{\\partial V_{DS}}$$\n    Again, since $\\Delta L \\ll L$, we have $L - \\Delta L \\approx L$. So,\n    $$\\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\approx \\frac{I_D}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta L}{\\partial V_{DS}}$$\n    Comparing this with the definition $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{I_D} \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{DS}}$, we get:\n    $$\\lambda \\approx \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta L}{\\partial V_{DS}}$$\n    The length of the pinched-off region, $\\Delta L$, is modeled as the width of the depletion region formed between the drain n+ region and the p-type body. Using the one-dimensional, one-sided abrupt junction approximation (since the drain is heavily doped n+ and the body is more lightly doped p-type with concentration $N_A$), the depletion width $x_d$ is:\n    $$\\Delta L(V_{DS}) \\approx x_d(V_{DS}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}} (V_{\\text{bi}} + V_{DB})}{q N_A}}$$\n    Here, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}$ is the permittivity of silicon, $q$ is the elementary charge, $V_{\\text{bi}}$ is the built-in potential of the junction, and $V_{DB}$ is the reverse bias across the drain-body junction. For a typical configuration where the source and body are grounded ($V_S=V_B=0$), $V_{DB} = V_{DS}$.\n    So, $\\Delta L(V_{DS}) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}} (V_{\\text{bi}} + V_{DS})}{q N_A}}$.\n    Now we compute the derivative:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial \\Delta L}{\\partial V_{DS}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}}{q N_A}\\right)^{1/2} (V_{\\text{bi}} + V_{DS})^{1/2} \\right] = \\left(\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}}{q N_A}\\right)^{1/2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} (V_{\\text{bi}} + V_{DS})^{-1/2}$$\n    Substituting this into the expression for $\\lambda$:\n    $$\\lambda \\approx \\frac{1}{L} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}}{q N_A}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{V_{\\text{bi}} + V_{DS}}} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}}}{q N_A (V_{\\text{bi}} + V_{DS})}}$$\n    This final expression shows that $\\lambda$ is inversely proportional to the channel length $L$ and also depends on the body doping $N_A$ and the drain bias $V_{DS}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A**\n-   **Extraction**: Proposes fitting a line to $I_D(V_{DS})$ in saturation and using $\\lambda \\approx \\frac{1}{I_D} \\left.\\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{DS}}\\right|_{V_{GS}}$. This matches the standard definition derived above.\n-   **Physical Model**: Uses $L_{\\text{eff}} = L - \\Delta L$ to derive $\\lambda \\approx \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta L}{\\partial V_{DS}}$. This is the correct intermediate step, as shown in the derivation.\n-   **Depletion Model**: Approximates $\\Delta L$ with the one-sided junction depletion width formula, $\\Delta L \\approx x_d(V_{DS}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{\\text{si}} (V_{\\text{bi}} + V_{DS})}{q N_A}}$. This is a standard and physically grounded approximation.\n-   **Final Expression**: The derivative $\\frac{\\partial x_d}{\\partial V_{DS}}$ is calculated correctly, leading to the final expression for $\\lambda$. This expression correctly captures the dependencies on $L$, $N_A$, and other physical parameters.\n-   **Conclusion**: Every step of the proposed procedure and the associated physical reasoning is correct within the framework of standard first-order MOSFET models.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B**\n-   **Extraction**: States that $\\lambda$ should be determined from the slope in the *linear region*. This is fundamentally incorrect. $\\lambda$ is a parameter that characterizes behavior in the *saturation* region.\n-   **Physical Model**: Claims $\\lambda \\propto W$. This is incorrect. As derived, $\\lambda$ is primarily dependent on $L$ and is, to first order, independent of $W$ because both $I_D$ and $\\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{DS}}$ are proportional to $W$, so the ratio is independent of $W$.\n-   **Physical Model**: Claims the dependence on $L$ is negligible under the GCA. This is the opposite of the truth. CLM is fundamentally about the ratio of $\\Delta L$ to $L$, making the dependence on $L$ (specifically $\\lambda \\propto 1/L$) central to the effect.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C**\n-   **Extraction**: Proposes to find $\\lambda$ from the transconductance $g_m = \\left.\\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}}\\right|_{V_{DS}}$ using the formula $\\lambda \\approx \\frac{1}{I_D} \\left.\\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}}\\right|_{V_{DS}}$. This confuses the output conductance, which defines $\\lambda$, with the transconductance. The formula is incorrect for $\\lambda$.\n-   **Physical Model**: Claims $\\lambda \\propto L$. This is incorrect. The effect of channel-length modulation is less pronounced in longer channels, so $\\lambda \\propto 1/L$.\n-   **Physical Model**: Claims doping and depletion are not relevant under the GCA. This is false. The GCA is an approximation about the electric field distribution, but it does not eliminate the role of doping in setting depletion widths, which is the physical origin of CLM.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D**\n-   **Extraction**: Correctly identifies the relationship between output resistance $r_o$, $I_D$, and $\\lambda$ as $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{r_o I_D}$. This is equivalent to $\\lambda = g_{ds}/I_D$. This part is correct.\n-   **Physical Model**: Proposes $\\lambda \\approx \\frac{W}{L} \\frac{\\partial x_d}{\\partial V_{DS}}$. The inclusion of the channel width $W$ in the numerator is incorrect. As explained for option B, the dependence on $W$ cancels out in the definition of $\\lambda$.\n-   **Physical Model**: Claims the dependence on body doping $N_A$ can be neglected. This is physically unsound. The depletion width $x_d$ is fundamentally determined by the doping level ($x_d \\propto 1/\\sqrt{N_A}$), so neglecting $N_A$ removes a key physical parameter from the model.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only Option A presents a fully correct procedure and physical explanation.",
