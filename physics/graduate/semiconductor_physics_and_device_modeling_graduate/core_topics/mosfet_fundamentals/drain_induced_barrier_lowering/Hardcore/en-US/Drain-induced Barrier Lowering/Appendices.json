            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of semiconductor device physics, is well-posed with sufficient data and clear objectives, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities related to Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) in a short-channel MOSFET. First, the DIBL coefficient, and second, the corresponding change in barrier height.\n\n**1. Quantification of Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL)**\n\nDIBL is a short-channel effect where the drain voltage affects the potential barrier between the source and the channel, thereby influencing the threshold voltage $V_T$. It is quantified as the magnitude of the threshold voltage shift per unit increase in drain-to-source voltage $V_D$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{DIBL} = -\\frac{dV_T}{dV_D}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the threshold voltage typically decreases as the drain voltage increases.\n\nIn this problem, the threshold voltage is determined by the constant-current method, where $V_T$ is defined as the gate voltage $V_G$ at which the drain current per unit width reaches a specific value $I_D^*$. The problem provides two such points:\n- At $V_{D,1} = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the threshold voltage is $V_{T,1} = V_{G,1} = 0.410\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n- At $V_{D,2} = 1.000\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the threshold voltage is $V_{T,2} = V_{G,2} = 0.292\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nWe can approximate the derivative with a finite difference calculation using the two given data points:\n$$\n\\text{DIBL} \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta V_T}{\\Delta V_D} = -\\frac{V_{T,2} - V_{T,1}}{V_{D,2} - V_{D,1}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta V_T = V_{G,2} - V_{G,1} = 0.292\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.410\\,\\mathrm{V} = -0.118\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta V_D = V_{D,2} - V_{D,1} = 1.000\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.050\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.950\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the DIBL value:\n$$\n\\text{DIBL} = -\\frac{-0.118\\,\\mathrm{V}}{0.950\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{0.118}{0.950}\\,\\mathrm{V/V} \\approx 0.12421\\,\\mathrm{V/V}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\mathrm{mV}/\\mathrm{V}$.\n$$\n\\text{DIBL} \\approx 0.12421\\,\\mathrm{V/V} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{1\\,\\mathrm{V}} = 124.21\\,\\mathrm{mV/V}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $124\\,\\mathrm{mV/V}$.\n\n**2. Estimation of Barrier Height Decrease**\n\nIn the subthreshold region of a MOSFET, the drain current is controlled by the rate of thermionic emission of electrons over the potential energy barrier between the source and the channel. The current is exponentially dependent on the height of this barrier, $\\phi_B$: $I_D \\propto \\exp(-q\\phi_B / (k_B T))$.\n\nThe condition of constant current ($I_D = I_D^*$) implies that the net barrier height $\\phi_B$ is the same for both measurement conditions. The barrier height is modulated by both the gate voltage $V_G$ and the drain voltage $V_D$. An increase in $V_D$ from $V_{D,1}$ to $V_{D,2}$ causes a lowering of the barrier, which would increase the current. To counteract this and maintain a constant current, the gate voltage is reduced from $V_{G,1}$ to $V_{G,2}$. This reduction in $V_G$ raises the barrier.\n\nThe magnitude of the barrier lowering caused by the change in drain voltage must be equal to the magnitude of the barrier raising caused by the compensatory change in gate voltage. The problem specifically instructs us to interpret the barrier height decrease as \"the change in electron energy associated with the observed gate-voltage reduction\".\n\nThe observed gate-voltage reduction is:\n$$\n|\\Delta V_G| = V_{G,1} - V_{G,2} = 0.410\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.292\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.118\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe change in potential energy, $\\Delta E$, for a particle with charge $q$ moving through a potential difference $\\Delta V$ is $\\Delta E = q\\Delta V$. For an electron, the charge is $q = -e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. A reduction in gate voltage from $V_{G,1}$ to $V_{G,2}$ (a potential change of $\\Delta V_G = V_{G,2} - V_{G,1} = -0.118\\,\\mathrm{V}$) causes an increase in the potential energy barrier for an electron.\n\nThe magnitude of this energy change is:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_B| = |(-e)(\\Delta V_G)| = e \\cdot |V_{G,2} - V_{G,1}| = e \\cdot (0.118\\,\\mathrm{V})\n$$\nWhen an energy change is expressed in units of electron-volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$), its numerical value is equal to the magnitude of the potential difference in volts through which the elementary charge moves. Therefore, the magnitude of the barrier energy change is:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_B| = 0.118\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThis value represents the magnitude of the barrier raising due to the gate voltage reduction, which, by the principle of compensation, must be equal to the magnitude of the barrier lowering induced by the increase in drain voltage. So, the decrease in the source-channel barrier height is $0.118\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. This result is already given to three significant figures.",

This exercise demonstrates the severe consequences of DIBL by linking it to the exponential increase in off-state leakage current, a primary source of static power consumption in digital circuits. You will use the relationship between DIBL and the subthreshold slope ($S$) to calculate how much a seemingly small change in drain voltage can increase unwanted current flow .",

            "problem": "A short-channel n-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) operating at room temperature exhibits subthreshold behavior governed by carriers thermally surmounting the source-channel barrier. In subthreshold, the drain current $I_D$ is controlled by the barrier height $\\Phi_B$ according to Boltzmann statistics. Let the gate voltage be $V_G$ and the drain voltage be $V_D$. For small inversion charge, the barrier is modulated linearly by both the gate and the drain potentials via capacitive coupling.\n\nThe subthreshold slope $S$ is defined at fixed $V_D$ as $S = \\left( \\frac{d V_G}{d \\log_{10} I_D} \\right)$, and Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) is defined as the magnitude of the threshold-voltage reduction per unit increase in drain bias, $\\eta = - \\frac{d V_T}{d V_D}$, where $V_T$ is the threshold voltage inferred at a fixed reference current in the subthreshold regime.\n\nAssume diffusion-dominated subthreshold transport, negligible channel-length modulation, negligible direct source–drain tunneling, and that the drain coupling to the barrier is uniform over the relevant bias range. Starting from the Boltzmann relation for current versus barrier height and the above definitions of $S$ and $\\eta$, derive how a change in drain bias shifts the $I_D$–$V_G$ characteristics horizontally and how this shift changes the off-state leakage at $V_G = 0$.\n\nGiven $S = 70$ mV/dec and $\\eta = 100$ mV/V, compute the gate-voltage shift of the $I_D$–$V_G$ curve at $V_D = 0.5$ V relative to $V_D = 50$ mV, and estimate the resulting multiplicative change in the off-state leakage current at $V_G = 0$ between these two drain biases. Report the gate-voltage shift as a signed value, where a negative value indicates a leftward shift (lower effective threshold). Express the gate-voltage shift in volts (V) and the leakage change as a dimensionless ratio. Round both quantities to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The problem describes the subthreshold behavior of a short-channel MOSFET, using standard definitions for subthreshold slope ($S$) and Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL, $\\eta$). The given values of $S = 70$ mV/dec and $\\eta = 100$ mV/V are physically realistic for modern scaled transistors. The assumptions of diffusion-dominated transport and linear barrier modulation are standard in simplified analytical models. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to derive a unique, meaningful solution. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe derivation begins with the fundamental relationship for subthreshold current, which is governed by thermal emission over a potential barrier, $\\Phi_B$. This dependence is exponential, following Boltzmann statistics:\n$$ I_D \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q\\Phi_B}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $I_D$ is the drain current, $q$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the barrier height $\\Phi_B$ is modulated linearly by the gate voltage $V_G$ and the drain voltage $V_D$. We can express this relationship as:\n$$ \\Phi_B(V_G, V_D) = \\Phi_{B0} - \\alpha V_G - \\beta V_D $$\nwhere $\\Phi_{B0}$ is a reference barrier height at zero bias, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are positive coupling coefficients for the gate and drain, respectively. The negative signs indicate that both an increasing gate voltage and an increasing drain voltage act to lower the barrier, thereby increasing the current.\n\nTo relate these coefficients to the given parameters $S$ and $\\eta$, we first consider the subthreshold slope $S$. It is defined at a fixed drain voltage as $S = \\left( \\frac{d V_G}{d \\log_{10} I_D} \\right)$. Taking the base-$10$ logarithm of the current expression:\n$$ \\log_{10}(I_D) = \\text{C} - \\frac{q\\Phi_B}{k_B T \\ln(10)} = \\text{C} - \\frac{q(\\Phi_{B0} - \\alpha V_G - \\beta V_D)}{k_B T \\ln(10)} $$\nwhere $\\text{C}$ is a constant. Differentiating with respect to $V_G$ at constant $V_D$:\n$$ \\frac{d \\log_{10}(I_D)}{d V_G} \\bigg|_{V_D} = \\frac{q\\alpha}{k_B T \\ln(10)} $$\nThe subthreshold slope is the inverse of this quantity:\n$$ S = \\left( \\frac{d \\log_{10}(I_D)}{d V_G} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{k_B T \\ln(10)}{q\\alpha} $$\n\nNext, we consider the DIBL parameter, $\\eta = - \\frac{d V_T}{d V_D}$. The threshold voltage $V_T$ in the subthreshold regime is defined as the gate voltage required to produce a specific, constant reference current. To find $\\frac{d V_T}{d V_D}$, we must determine how $V_G$ has to change with $V_D$ to keep $I_D$ (and thus $\\Phi_B$) constant. Setting the total differential of $\\Phi_B$ to zero:\n$$ d\\Phi_B = \\frac{\\partial \\Phi_B}{\\partial V_G} dV_G + \\frac{\\partial \\Phi_B}{\\partial V_D} dV_D = 0 $$\nFrom our linear model, $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_B}{\\partial V_G} = -\\alpha$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_B}{\\partial V_D} = -\\beta$. Substituting these into the differential equation:\n$$ -\\alpha dV_G - \\beta dV_D = 0 $$\nThe derivative $\\frac{dV_G}{dV_D}$ at constant current is, by definition, $\\frac{dV_T}{dV_D}$:\n$$ \\frac{dV_T}{dV_D} = \\frac{dV_G}{dV_D}\\bigg|_{I_D=\\text{const}} = -\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} $$\nSubstituting this into the definition of DIBL:\n$$ \\eta = - \\frac{dV_T}{dV_D} = - \\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} $$\nThis provides the essential connection between the physical drain coupling coefficient $\\beta$ and the phenomenological DIBL parameter $\\eta$.\n\nThe horizontal shift of the $I_D$–$V_G$ curve for a change in drain voltage $\\Delta V_D$ is the change in gate voltage $\\Delta V_G$ required to maintain a constant current. Since the problem statement assumes uniform drain coupling, the derivative $\\frac{dV_T}{dV_D}$ is constant, and we can write:\n$$ \\Delta V_G = \\frac{dV_T}{dV_D} \\Delta V_D = -\\eta \\Delta V_D $$\nThis equation shows that an increase in drain voltage causes a negative (leftward) shift in the $I_D$–$V_G$ characteristic, effectively lowering the threshold voltage.\n\nWe are asked to compute this shift as $V_D$ changes from $V_{D1} = 50 \\text{ mV} = 0.050 \\text{ V}$ to $V_{D2} = 0.5 \\text{ V}$. The change in drain voltage is:\n$$ \\Delta V_D = V_{D2} - V_{D1} = 0.5 \\text{ V} - 0.050 \\text{ V} = 0.45 \\text{ V} $$\nGiven the DIBL parameter $\\eta = 100 \\text{ mV/V} = 0.100 \\text{ V/V}$, the gate-voltage shift is:\n$$ \\Delta V_G = -(0.100 \\text{ V/V}) \\times (0.45 \\text{ V}) = -0.045 \\text{ V} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the shift is $-0.04500$ V.\n\nNow, we estimate the resulting multiplicative change in the off-state leakage current at $V_G = 0$. Let $I_{\\text{off},1}$ be the leakage current at $(V_G, V_D) = (0, V_{D1})$ and $I_{\\text{off},2}$ be the leakage current at $(V_G, V_D) = (0, V_{D2})$. We need to compute the ratio $\\frac{I_{\\text{off},2}}{I_{\\text{off},1}}$.\n\nThe leftward shift of the $I_D$–$V_G$ curve by $\\Delta V_G$ implies that the current at a given $V_G$ on the new curve (at $V_{D2}$) is equal to the current at $V_G-\\Delta V_G$ on the old curve (at $V_{D1}$).\n$$ I_D(V_G, V_{D2}) = I_D(V_G - \\Delta V_G, V_{D1}) $$\nApplying this to the off-state leakage current at $V_G=0$:\n$$ I_{\\text{off},2} = I_D(0, V_{D2}) = I_D(0 - \\Delta V_G, V_{D1}) = I_D(-\\Delta V_G, V_{D1}) $$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{off},2}}{I_{\\text{off},1}} = \\frac{I_D(-\\Delta V_G, V_{D1})}{I_D(0, V_{D1})} $$\nFrom the definition of the subthreshold slope, for a given $V_D$, the relationship between current and gate voltage is given by:\n$$ \\log_{10}(I_D) = \\frac{V_G}{S} + \\text{constant} $$\nThus, for two different gate voltages $V_{G,a}$ and $V_{G,b}$ at fixed $V_D = V_{D1}$:\n$$ \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_D(V_{G,b}, V_{D1})}{I_D(V_{G,a}, V_{D1})}\\right) = \\frac{V_{G,b} - V_{G,a}}{S} $$\nWe set $V_{G,a} = 0$ and $V_{G,b} = -\\Delta V_G$:\n$$ \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_D(-\\Delta V_G, V_{D1})}{I_D(0, V_{D1})}\\right) = \\frac{-\\Delta V_G - 0}{S} = -\\frac{\\Delta V_G}{S} $$\nTaking the antilogarithm gives the desired ratio:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{off},2}}{I_{\\text{off},1}} = 10^{-\\Delta V_G / S} $$\nWe are given $S = 70$ mV/dec and we calculated $\\Delta V_G = -0.045 \\text{ V} = -45$ mV.\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{off},2}}{I_{\\text{off},1}} = 10^{-(-45 \\text{ mV}) / (70 \\text{ mV/dec})} = 10^{45/70} = 10^{9/14} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ 10^{9/14} \\approx 10^{0.642857...} \\approx 4.39396... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the multiplicative change in leakage current is $4.394$.",
