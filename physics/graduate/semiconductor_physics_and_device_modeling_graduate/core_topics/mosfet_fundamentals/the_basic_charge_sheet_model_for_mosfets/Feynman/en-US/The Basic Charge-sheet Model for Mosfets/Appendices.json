It balances the flat-band voltage $V_{FB}$, the surface potential $\\psi_s$, and the voltage drop across the oxide needed to support the semiconductor charge $Q_{sc}$:\n$$V_T = V_{FB} + \\psi_s - \\frac{Q_{sc}}{C_{ox}}$$\nAt the threshold of strong inversion, the semiconductor charge is dominated by the charge of ionized acceptors in the depletion region, so $Q_{sc} \\approx Q_{dep}$. The condition for strong inversion requires a total band bending of $2\\phi_F$ in the absence of body bias. When a source-to-body reverse bias $V_{SB}$ is applied, the electron quasi-Fermi level at the source is separated from the hole Fermi level in the bulk by $V_{SB}$.

In reality, the carrier density normal to the interface spreads over a finite thickness, resulting in a charge centroid located at a finite distance $x_{c} > 0$ from the interface. This occurs for two main reasons. First, from a classical electrostatic viewpoint, the carrier density decays exponentially into the semiconductor rather than forming a delta function at the interface. Second, and more fundamentally, quantum mechanics dictates that the electrons confined in the triangular potential well at the interface occupy quantized energy levels. The ground-state wavefunction is not localized at the interface but has a peak probability at a small distance from it, establishing a non-zero centroid $x_c$.\n\nWe now derive the corrected small-signal gate-to-channel capacitance, $C = \\mathrm{d}Q_G / \\mathrm{d}V_{G \\to ch}$, where $Q_G$ is the gate charge per unit area and $V_{G \\to ch}$ is the voltage between the gate and the charge centroid. For clarity, we will work with magnitudes of incremental charges and voltages, as all quantities change monotonically in strong inversion.

Assuming the centroid position $x_c$ is approximately constant for a small change in charge, we get $\\int x \\mathrm{d}\\rho_{abs} \\mathrm{d}x \\approx x_c \\mathrm{d}|Q_i|$. Therefore, the incremental voltage drop across the inversion layer is:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{d}V_{inv} = \\mathrm{d}\\psi_s \\approx \\frac{x_c}{\\varepsilon_{si}} \\mathrm{d}|Q_i| = \\frac{x_c}{\\varepsilon_{si}} \\mathrm{d}Q_G\n    $$\n\nCombining the two voltage drops:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}V_{G \\to ch} = \\left( \\frac{t_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} + \\frac{x_c}{\\varepsilon_{si}} \\right) \\mathrm{d}Q_G\n$$\nThe small-signal gate-to-channel capacitance per unit area is then:\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q_G}{\\mathrm{d}V_{G \\to ch}} = \\left( \\frac{t_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} + \\frac{x_c}{\\varepsilon_{si}} \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the total capacitance is the series combination of the oxide capacitance and an effective \"inversion layer capacitance\" $C_{inv} = \\varepsilon_{si}/x_c$. This physically represents that the gate's electric field must terminate on charge that is, on average, a distance $x_c$ into the semiconductor, effectively increasing the electrical distance from the gate.\n\nThe final expression is a capacitance per unit area in units of $\\mathrm{F}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ and completes the required derivation.",
