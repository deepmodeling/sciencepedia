            "problem": "A Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) with its source terminal tied to the global reference is biased at a fixed operating point in strong inversion and moderate field conditions. The drain current is a function of the terminal voltages relative to the source, denoted by $I_{d}(V_{gs},V_{bs},V_{ds})$. Around the bias point, small, quasi-static perturbations are applied simultaneously at the gate, body, and drain terminals. The perturbations are sufficiently small that higher-order terms beyond first order can be neglected, and the modulation frequency is sufficiently low that capacitive effects can be ignored. Thermal and flicker noise are negligible relative to the measured signal levels.\n\nStarting from first principles for multivariable functions and the definition of partial derivatives, derive the linearized relation between the incremental drain current and small terminal-voltage perturbations about the bias point. Using this linearization, extract the small-signal parameters: gate transconductance $g_{m}$, body transconductance $g_{mb}$, and output conductance $g_{ds}$ from the following three independent differential measurements, each performed about the same bias point. In each experiment, the indicated small voltage perturbations are applied simultaneously and the corresponding incremental drain current is recorded. All voltages are terminal-to-source quantities, and the source node remains fixed.\n\n- Experiment $1$: $\\Delta V_{g} = +15\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\Delta V_{b} = -10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\Delta V_{d} = +20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, measured $\\Delta I_{d} = +120\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}$.\n- Experiment $2$: $\\Delta V_{g} = -5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\Delta V_{b} = +25\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\Delta V_{d} = +10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, measured $\\Delta I_{d} = +20\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}$.\n- Experiment $3$: $\\Delta V_{g} = +10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\Delta V_{b} = +10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\Delta V_{d} = -30\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, measured $\\Delta I_{d} = +70\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}$.\n\nReport the extracted values of $g_{m}$, $g_{mb}$, and $g_{ds}$ in Siemens, and round your answer to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem requires the extraction of small-signal parameters for a MOSFET from a series of measurements. The process begins with a formal derivation of the underlying linear model from first principles.\n\nThe drain current $I_d$ is given as a function of the gate-to-source voltage $V_{gs}$, body-to-source voltage $V_{bs}$, and drain-to-source voltage $V_{ds}$, denoted as $I_d(V_{gs}, V_{bs}, V_{ds})$. The device is operated at a quiescent DC bias point $(V_{GS_Q}, V_{BS_Q}, V_{DS_Q})$, which produces a DC drain current $I_{D_Q}$.\n\nFor small, quasi-static perturbations $(\\Delta V_{gs}, \\Delta V_{bs}, \\Delta V_{ds})$ around this bias point, the resulting change in drain current, $\\Delta I_d$, can be approximated by the first-order Taylor series expansion of the function $I_d$.

The gate transconductance, $g_m = \\left(\\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{gs}}\\right)_{Q}$.\n2.  The body transconductance (or back-gate transconductance), $g_{mb} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{bs}}\\right)_{Q}$.\n3.  The output conductance, $g_{ds} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{ds}}\\right)_{Q}$.\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the approximation yields the linearized small-signal model. For clarity, we will use the notation $\\Delta V_g = \\Delta V_{gs}$, $\\Delta V_b = \\Delta V_{bs}$, and $\\Delta V_d = \\Delta V_{ds}$.\n$$\n\\Delta I_d = g_m \\Delta V_g + g_{mb} \\Delta V_b + g_{ds} \\Delta V_d\n$$\nThis equation relates the incremental drain current to the incremental terminal voltages via the three unknown parameters $g_m, g_{mb}, g_{ds}$.

First, the mobility activation energy, $E_a$, is extracted from the linear-regime transfer characteristics at two different temperatures. Second, this information is used to compute the ratio of the peak transconductances in the saturation regime at the same two temperatures.\n\nPart 1: Extraction of the Mobility Activation Energy ($E_a$)\n\nThe drain current $I_D$ of a Field-Effect Transistor (FET) in the linear regime of operation (small $V_{DS}$) is given by the expression:\n$$I_D = \\frac{W}{L} \\mu C_{ox} \\left[ (V_G - V_{th})V_{DS} - \\frac{V_{DS}^2}{2} \\right]$$\nwhere $W$ is the channel width, $L$ is the channel length, $\\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, $C_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $V_G$ is the gate-to-source voltage, $V_{th}$ is the threshold voltage, and $V_{DS}$ is the drain-to-source voltage.\n\nThe problem defines a small-signal slope $S(T)$ from the transfer characteristics in this regime:\n$$S(T) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{G}}\\right|_{V_{DS} = V_{DS,\\mathrm{lin}}}$$\nDifferentiating the $I_D$ expression with respect to $V_G$ while treating $V_{DS}$ as a constant gives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_G} = \\frac{W}{L} \\mu(T) C_{ox} V_{DS}$$\nThus, the measured slope $S(T)$ at a fixed bias $V_{DS,\\mathrm{lin}}$ is directly proportional to the temperature-dependent mobility $\\mu(T)$:\n$$S(T) = \\left(\\frac{W}{L} C_{ox} V_{DS,\\mathrm{lin}}\\right) \\mu(T)$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is a constant with respect to temperature.

The drain current $I_D$ is given as a polynomial approximation around the DC bias point $V_{GS0}$.\nThe drain current is expressed as:\n$$I_{D}(V_{GS}) \\approx a_{0} + a_{1}x + a_{2}x^{2} + a_{3}x^{3}$$\nwhere $x = V_{GS} - V_{GS0}$.\n\nThis polynomial is a truncated Taylor series expansion of $I_{D}(V_{GS})$ around $V_{GS0}$:\n$$I_{D}(V_{GS}) = I_{D}(V_{GS0}) + \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}}\\bigg|_{V_{GS0}} x + \\frac{1}{2!} \\frac{\\partial^2 I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}^2}\\bigg|_{V_{GS0}} x^2 + \\frac{1}{3!} \\frac{\\partial^3 I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}^3}\\bigg|_{V_{GS0}} x^3 + \\dots$$\n\nThe small-signal transconductance $g_m$ and its derivatives at the bias point $V_{GS0}$ are defined as:\n$$g_m \\equiv \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}}\\bigg|_{V_{GS0}}$$\n$$g_m' \\equiv \\frac{\\partial^2 I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}^2}\\bigg|_{V_{GS0}}$$\n$$g_m'' \\equiv \\frac{\\partial^3 I_D}{\\partial V_{GS}^3}\\bigg|_{V_{GS0}}$$\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of the given polynomial with the Taylor series expansion, we can relate the fit coefficients $a_k$ to the transconductance derivatives:\n$$a_0 = I_D(V_{GS0})$$\n$$a_1 = g_m$$\n$$a_2 = \\frac{1}{2} g_m'$$\n$$a_3 = \\frac{1}{6} g_m''$$\n\nFrom this, we can compute the required values of $g_m$, $g_m'$, and $g_m''$ using the provided coefficients:\n$$g_m = a_1 = 5\\,\\mathrm{mA/V}$$\n$$g_m' = 2 a_2 = 2 \\times (1.2\\,\\mathrm{mA/V^2}) = 2.4\\,\\mathrm{mA/V^2}$$\n$$g_m'' = 6 a_3 = 6 \\times (0.6\\,\\mathrm{mA/V^3}) = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{mA/V^3}$$\n\nThe total gate-source voltage is $V_{GS}(t) = V_{GS0} + x(t)$, where the small-signal excitation is $x(t) = v[\\cos(\\omega_1 t) + \\cos(\\omega_2 t)]$. The AC component of the drain current, $i_d(t)$, is given by:\n$$i_d(t) = I_D(V_{GS}(t)) - I_D(V_{GS0}) = a_1 x(t) + a_2 x(t)^2 + a_3 x(t)^3$$\nUsing the relations derived earlier, this can be written in terms of the transconductance derivatives:\n$$i_d(t) = g_m x(t) + \\frac{1}{2} g_m' x(t)^2 + \\frac{1}{6} g_m'' x(t)^3$$\n\nWe are interested in the third-order intermodulation (IM3) product at frequency $2\\omega_1 - \\omega_2$. This component arises from the cubic term in the expansion, $\\frac{1}{6} g_m'' x(t)^3$. Let's analyze this term:\n$$x(t)^3 = \\left(v[\\cos(\\omega_1 t) + \\cos(\\omega_2 t)]\\right)^3 = v^3 [\\cos^3(\\omega_1 t) + 3\\cos^2(\\omega_1 t)\\cos(\\omega_2 t) + 3\\cos(\\omega_1 t)\\cos^2(\\omega_2 t) + \\cos^3(\\omega_2 t)]$$\nThe term responsible for the $2\\omega_1 - \\omega_2$ frequency component is $3\\cos^2(\\omega_1 t)\\cos(\\omega_2 t)$. We use the trigonometric identities $\\cos^2\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\theta))$ and $\\cos A \\cos B = \\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(A-B) + \\cos(A+B)]$:\n$$3\\cos^2(\\omega_1 t)\\cos(\\omega_2 t) = 3 \\left[\\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\omega_1 t))\\right] \\cos(\\omega_2 t)$$\n$$= \\frac{3}{2}\\cos(\\omega_2 t) + \\frac{3}{2}\\cos(2\\omega_1 t)\\cos(\\omega_2 t)$$\n$$= \\frac{3}{2}\\cos(\\omega_2 t) + \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}[\\cos((2\\omega_1 - \\omega_2)t) + \\cos((2\\omega_1 + \\omega_2)t)]$$\n$$= \\frac{3}{2}\\cos(\\omega_2 t) + \\frac{3}{4}\\cos((2\\omega_1 - \\omega_2)t) + \\frac{3}{4}\\cos((2\\omega_1 + \\omega_2)t)$$\nThe component of $x(t)^3$ that oscillates at frequency $2\\omega_1 - \\omega_2$ is thus $v^3 \\frac{3}{4} \\cos((2\\omega_1 - \\omega_2)t)$.\n\nThe current component at this frequency, $i_{IM3}(t)$, is obtained by multiplying this term by the coefficient from the Taylor series, $\\frac{1}{6}g_m''$:\n$$i_{IM3}(t) = \\frac{1}{6}g_m'' \\left(v^3 \\frac{3}{4}\\cos((2\\omega_1 - \\omega_2)t)\\right) = \\frac{3}{24}g_m'' v^3 \\cos((2\\omega_1 - \\omega_2)t) = \\frac{1}{8}g_m'' v^3 \\cos((2\\omega_1 - \\omega_2)t)$$\nThe amplitude of this IM3 current is:\n$$I_{IM3} = \\frac{1}{8}g_m'' v^3$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of this amplitude to the amplitude of the fundamental current at $\\omega_1$ contributed by the linear term only. The linear current contribution is given by the first term in the series:\n$$i_{lin}(t) = g_m x(t) = g_m v[\\cos(\\omega_1 t) + \\cos(\\omega_2 t)]$$\nThe component of this current at frequency $\\omega_1$ is $g_m v \\cos(\\omega_1 t)$, and its amplitude is:\n$$I_{\\omega_1, \\text{lin}} = g_m v$$\n\nThe desired ratio, $R$, is therefore:\n$$R = \\frac{I_{IM3}}{I_{\\omega_1, \\text{lin}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{8}g_m'' v^3}{g_m v} = \\frac{1}{8} \\frac{g_m''}{g_m} v^2$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$g_m = 5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A/V}$\n$g_m'' = 3.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A/V^3}$\n$v = 20\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\n$$R = \\frac{1}{8} \\frac{3.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A/V^3}}{5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A/V}} (0.02\\,\\mathrm{V})^2$$\n$$R = \\frac{1}{8} \\frac{3.6}{5} (0.0004)$$\n$$R = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 0.72 \\times 0.0004$$\n$$R = 0.09 \\times 0.0004$$\n$$R = 0.000036$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R = 0.00003600$$",
