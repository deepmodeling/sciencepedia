            "problem": "A Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) with its source terminal tied to the global reference is biased at a fixed operating point in strong inversion and moderate field conditions. The drain current is a function of the terminal voltages relative to the source, denoted by $I_{d}(V_{gs},V_{bs},V_{ds})$. Around the bias point, small, quasi-static perturbations are applied simultaneously at the gate, body, and drain terminals. The perturbations are sufficiently small that higher-order terms beyond first order can be neglected, and the modulation frequency is sufficiently low that capacitive effects can be ignored. Thermal and flicker noise are negligible relative to the measured signal levels.\n\nStarting from first principles for multivariable functions and the definition of partial derivatives, derive the linearized relation between the incremental drain current and small terminal-voltage perturbations about the bias point. Using this linearization, extract the small-signal parameters: gate transconductance $g_{m}$, body transconductance $g_{mb}$, and output conductance $g_{ds}$ from the following three independent differential measurements, each performed about the same bias point. In each experiment, the indicated small voltage perturbations are applied simultaneously and the corresponding incremental drain current is recorded. All voltages are terminal-to-source quantities, and the source node remains fixed.\n\n- Experiment $1$: $\\Delta V_{g} = +15\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\Delta V_{b} = -10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\Delta V_{d} = +20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, measured $\\Delta I_{d} = +120\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}$.\n- Experiment $2$: $\\Delta V_{g} = -5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\Delta V_{b} = +25\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\Delta V_{d} = +10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, measured $\\Delta I_{d} = +20\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}$.\n- Experiment $3$: $\\Delta V_{g} = +10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\Delta V_{b} = +10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\Delta V_{d} = -30\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, measured $\\Delta I_{d} = +70\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}$.\n\nReport the extracted values of $g_{m}$, $g_{mb}$, and $g_{ds}$ in Siemens, and round your answer to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem requires the extraction of small-signal parameters for a MOSFET from a series of measurements. The process begins with a formal derivation of the underlying linear model from first principles.\n\nThe drain current $I_d$ is given as a function of the gate-to-source voltage $V_{gs}$, body-to-source voltage $V_{bs}$, and drain-to-source voltage $V_{ds}$, denoted as $I_d(V_{gs}, V_{bs}, V_{ds})$. The device is operated at a quiescent DC bias point $(V_{GS_Q}, V_{BS_Q}, V_{DS_Q})$, which produces a DC drain current $I_{D_Q}$.\n\nFor small, quasi-static perturbations $(\\Delta V_{gs}, \\Delta V_{bs}, \\Delta V_{ds})$ around this bias point, the resulting change in drain current, $\\Delta I_d$, can be approximated by the first-order Taylor series expansion of the function $I_d$. The total differential of $I_d$ is:\n$$\ndI_d = \\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{gs}} dV_{gs} + \\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{bs}} dV_{bs} + \\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{ds}} dV_{ds}\n$$\nFor small, finite perturbations, we can approximate the differentials with deltas:\n$$\n\\Delta I_d \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{gs}}\\right)_{Q} \\Delta V_{gs} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{bs}}\\right)_{Q} \\Delta V_{bs} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{ds}}\\right)_{Q} \\Delta V_{ds}\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are evaluated at the quiescent operating point $Q$ and represent the small-signal parameters:\n1.

The output conductance, $g_{ds} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{ds}}\\right)_{Q}$.\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the approximation yields the linearized small-signal model.
