The observation that fractional variation is $O(\\delta/x_d)$, leading to an approximately constant space charge and a linear local field, is correct.\n- There is an error in the provided expression for the Taylor expansion: $N(x) \\approx \\alpha x_d + \\alpha (x \\mp x_d)$. For the edge at $x \\approx -x_d$, the formula gives $N(x) \\approx \\alpha x_d + \\alpha (x + x_d) = \\alpha x + 2\\alpha x_d$, which is not a valid approximation of $N(x) = \\alpha x$. However, this appears to be a minor error in stating the justification. The primary quantitative claims and the physical conclusions about the local approximation are all correct. Among the given choices, this option is by far the most accurate.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB.

Outside this region, the charge density is $0$. Since the permittivity is constant within each region, the standard Poisson's equation $\\frac{d^{2}\\phi}{dx^{2}} = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon}$ applies.\n\nFor the p-type region ($-W_{p} \\le x < 0$):\n$\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_{p}} = -\\frac{qN_{A}}{\\epsilon_{p}}$. Integrating with the boundary condition $E(-W_{p})=0$ gives:\n$$\nE(x) = \\int_{-W_{p}}^{x} \\left(-\\frac{qN_{A}}{\\epsilon_{p}}\\right) dx' = -\\frac{qN_{A}}{\\epsilon_{p}}(x+W_{p})\n$$\n\nFor the n-type region ($0 < x \\le W_{n}$):\n$\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_{n}} = \\frac{qN_{D}}{\\epsilon_{n}}$. Integrating with the boundary condition $E(W_{n})=0$ gives:\n$$\nE(x) = \\int_{W_{n}}^{x} \\frac{qN_{D}}{\\epsilon_{n}} dx' = \\frac{qN_{D}}{\\epsilon_{n}}(x-W_{n})\n$$\nThe built-in potential, $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$, is the total potential drop across the depletion region, given by the integral of the electric field:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{bi}} = \\phi(W_{n}) - \\phi(-W_{p}) = -\\int_{-W_{p}}^{W_{n}} E(x) dx\n$$\nWe split the integral into two parts, one for each region:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{bi}} = -\\int_{-W_{p}}^{0} E(x) dx - \\int_{0}^{W_{n}} E(x) dx\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $E(x)$:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{bi}} = -\\int_{-W_{p}}^{0} \\left(-\\frac{qN_{A}}{\\epsilon_{p}}(x+W_{p})\\right) dx - \\int_{0}^{W_{n}} \\left(\\frac{qN_{D}}{\\epsilon_{n}}(x-W_{n})\\right) dx\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{bi}} = \\frac{qN_{A}}{\\epsilon_{p}} \\int_{-W_{p}}^{0} (x+W_{p}) dx - \\frac{qN_{D}}{\\epsilon_{n}} \\int_{0}^{W_{n}} (x-W_{n}) dx\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{bi}} = \\frac{qN_{A}}{\\epsilon_{p}} \\left[\\frac{(x+W_{p})^{2}}{2}\\right]_{-W_{p}}^{0} - \\frac{qN_{D}}{\\epsilon_{n}} \\left[\\frac{(x-W_{n})^{2}}{2}\\right]_{0}^{W_{n}}\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{bi}} = \\frac{qN_{A}}{\\epsilon_{p}} \\left(\\frac{W_{p}^{2}}{2} - 0\\right) - \\frac{qN_{D}}{\\epsilon_{n}} \\left(0 - \\frac{(-W_{n})^{2}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the built-in potential:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{bi}} = \\frac{qN_{A}W_{p}^{2}}{2\\epsilon_{p}} + \\frac{qN_{D}W_{n}^{2}}{2\\epsilon_{n}}\n$$\nThis expression relates the built-in potential to the depletion widths and material parameters, accounting for the different permittivities in the p-type and n-type materials of the heterojunction.",
