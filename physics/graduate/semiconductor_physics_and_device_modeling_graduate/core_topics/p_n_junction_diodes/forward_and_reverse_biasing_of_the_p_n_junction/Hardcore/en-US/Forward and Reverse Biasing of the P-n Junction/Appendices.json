            "solution": "The small-signal differential conductance per unit area, $g_d(V,T)$, is defined as the first derivative of the current density $J(V,T)$ with respect to the applied voltage $V$. We begin with the provided Shockley diode equation:\n$$J(V,T) = J_{s}(T)\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{q V}{\\eta k_{B} T}\\right) - 1\\right]$$\nTo find $g_d(V,T)$, we compute the derivative $\\frac{dJ}{dV}$.

The quantity $V_{T}^* = \\frac{\\eta k_B T}{q}$ can be viewed as a characteristic voltage scale, related to the thermal voltage.\n\n1.  **Reverse Bias ($V < 0$)**: When the junction is reverse biased, $V$ is negative. For a reverse bias magnitude $|V|$ significantly larger than $V_{T}^*$ (i.e., $V \\ll -\\frac{\\eta k_B T}{q}$), the argument of the exponential is large and negative. Consequently, the exponential term approaches zero:\n    $$\\exp\\left(\\frac{q V}{\\eta k_{B} T}\\right) \\to 0 \\quad \\text{as } V \\to -\\infty$$\n    Therefore, the differential conductance $g_d$ becomes vanishingly small. This is consistent with the physical behavior of a reverse-biased diode, which ideally acts as an open circuit with very high differential resistance ($r_d = 1/g_d \\to \\infty$).\n\n2.  **Zero Bias ($V = 0$)**: At zero applied voltage, the exponential term evaluates to $\\exp(0) = 1$. The conductance has a finite, non-zero value:\n    $$g_{d}(0,T) = \\frac{q J_s(T)}{\\eta k_{B} T}$$\n    This represents the conductance of the diode at the origin of its $J$-$V$ characteristic.\n\n3.  **Forward Bias ($V > 0$)**: When the junction is forward biased, $V$ is positive, and the exponential term grows rapidly with increasing $V$.\n    -   For weak forward bias ($0 < V \\approx V_{T}^*$), the conductance increases from its zero-bias value.\n    -   For strong forward bias ($V \\gg \\frac{\\eta k_B T}{q}$), the $-1$ term in the original Shockley equation is negligible, so $J \\approx J_s \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{\\eta k_B T}\\right)$. It is insightful to express $g_d$ in terms of the DC current density $J$. From the Shockley equation, $J_s \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{\\eta k_B T}\\right) = J + J_s$. Substituting this into our expression for $g_d$:\n        $$g_d(V,T) = \\frac{q}{\\eta k_B T} \\left( J(V,T) + J_s(T) \\right)$$\n        Under strong forward bias, $J \\gg J_s$, so we can approximate the conductance as:\n        $$g_d(V,T) \\approx \\frac{q J(V,T)}{\\eta k_B T}$$\n        This shows that in the forward-biased regime, the small-signal conductance is approximately proportional to the DC operating current density.\n\n**Dependence on Temperature ($T$)**\n\nTemperature affects $g_d$ in three ways: through the explicit $1/T$ prefactor, the explicit $1/T$ term in the exponential's argument, and the implicit, strong dependence of the saturation current density $J_s(T)$.\n\nThe saturation current density $J_s(T)$ is fundamentally linked to thermally generated minority carriers. It is proportional to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i^2$, which has a dominant temperature dependence of the form $n_i^2 \\propto T^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$, where $E_g$ is the semiconductor bandgap energy. Thus, $J_s(T)$ increases very rapidly with temperature.\n\n1.  **Reverse Bias ($V < 0$)**: In this regime, $g_d$ is very small. Its value is $g_{d} = \\frac{q J_s(T)}{\\eta k_B T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{\\eta k_B T}\\right)$. Both $J_s(T)$ and the exponential term $\\exp\\left(-|qV|/(\\eta k_B T)\\right)$ increase with temperature. Therefore, the very small reverse-bias conductance increases as temperature rises.\n\n2.  **Forward Bias ($V > 0$, fixed voltage)**: Considering the expression $g_d(V,T) = \\frac{q J_s(T)}{\\eta k_B T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{\\eta k_B T}\\right)$ for a fixed positive $V$. The temperature dependence of $J_s(T)$ is far more significant than the other terms. Let's substitute the approximate form for $J_s(T) \\propto T^m \\exp(-E_g / k_B T)$, where $m \\approx 3$.\n    $$g_d(V,T) \\propto \\frac{T^m \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)}{T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{\\eta k_B T}\\right) = T^{m-1} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV/\\eta - E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n    In typical operation, the forward voltage is less than the bandgap voltage, i.e., $V < E_g/q$, so the numerator in the exponential, $(qV/\\eta - E_g)$, is negative. Let this be $-C$, where $C > 0$. The dependence is then $g_d \\propto T^{m-1} \\exp(-C / (k_B T))$. As $T$ increases, both the polynomial term $T^{m-1}$ and the exponential term $\\exp(-C / (k_B T))$ increase. Thus, for a fixed forward voltage, the differential conductance increases strongly with temperature. Physically, a higher temperature provides more thermal energy to carriers, leading to a much larger current and conductance for the same applied voltage.",

The term $\\frac{k_B T}{q}$ is the thermal voltage, $V_T$. Using the standard values for the Boltzmann constant ($k_B \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$) and the elementary charge ($q \\approx 1.6021766 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$):\n$$\nV_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(300\\ \\mathrm{K})}{1.6021766 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\nNow, substituting the numerical values into the expression for $R_s$:\n$$\nR_s \\approx 2.000\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega} - \\frac{(1.08)(0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V})}{0.200\\ \\mathrm{A}}\n$$\n$$\nR_s \\approx 2.000\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega} - \\frac{0.02792016\\ \\mathrm{V}}{0.200\\ \\mathrm{A}}\n$$\n$$\nR_s \\approx 2.000\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega} - 0.1396008\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\n$$\n$$\nR_s \\approx 1.8603992\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nR_s \\approx 1.860\\ \\mathrm{\\Omega}\n$$",
