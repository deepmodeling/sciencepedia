The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Depletion Width $W$\n\nWe begin with the one-dimensional Poisson's equation relating the electrostatic potential $\\phi(x)$ to the charge density $\\rho(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_s}\n$$\nLet the metallurgical junction be at $x=0$. The space charge region extends from $x = -x_p$ on the $p$-side to $x = x_n$ on the $n$-side. The total depletion width is $W = x_p + x_n$. According to the depletion approximation, the charge density is given by:\n$$\n\\rho(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n-qN_A & \\text{for } -x_p < x < 0 \\\\\n+qN_D & \\text{for } 0 < x < x_n \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe electric field is $E(x) = -\\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx}$. Integrating Poisson's equation once gives the electric field: $\\frac{dE(x)}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_s}$.\n\nFor the $p$-side ($-x_p < x < 0$):\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dx} = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s} \\implies E(x) = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}x + C_1\n$$\nThe boundary condition is that the electric field must be zero at the edge of the depletion region, $E(-x_p)=0$. This yields $C_1 = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}x_p$.\n$$\nE(x) = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}(x+x_p) \\quad \\text{for } -x_p \\le x \\le 0\n$$\nFor the $n$-side ($0 < x < x_n$):\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s} \\implies E(x) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}x + C_2\n$$\nThe boundary condition is $E(x_n)=0$, which yields $C_2 = -\\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}x_n$.\n$$\nE(x) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}(x-x_n) \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le x_n\n$$\nThe electric field must be continuous at the junction $x=0$. Equating the two expressions for $E(x)$ at $x=0$:\n$$\n-\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}(0+x_p) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}(0-x_n) \\implies N_A x_p = N_D x_n\n$$\nThis is the charge neutrality condition: the total negative charge per unit area on the $p$-side, $-qN_Ax_p$, must balance the total positive charge per unit area on the $n$-side, $+qN_Dx_n$.\n\nThe total potential drop $V$ across the junction is the integral of the electric field over the depletion width:\n$$\nV = -\\int_{-x_p}^{x_n} E(x) dx = -\\left[ \\int_{-x_p}^{0} -\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}(x+x_p)dx + \\int_{0}^{x_n} \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}(x-x_n)dx \\right]\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$\nV = \\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}\\left[\\frac{x^2}{2} + x_p x\\right]_{-x_p}^0 - \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}\\left[\\frac{x^2}{2} - x_n x\\right]_0^{x_n}\n$$\n$$\nV = \\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}\\left(0 - \\left(\\frac{x_p^2}{2}-x_p^2\\right)\\right) - \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}\\left(\\left(\\frac{x_n^2}{2}-x_n^2\\right) - 0\\right) = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\epsilon_s}x_p^2 + \\frac{qN_D}{2\\epsilon_s}x_n^2\n$$\nSo, we have $V = \\frac{q}{2\\epsilon_s} (N_A x_p^2 + N_D x_n^2)$.\nWe can express $x_p$ and $x_n$ in terms of the total width $W$ using $W = x_p + x_n$ and $N_A x_p = N_D x_n$.\nFrom the charge neutrality, $x_p = \\frac{N_D}{N_A}x_n$. Substituting into the expression for $W$:\n$W = \\frac{N_D}{N_A}x_n + x_n = x_n \\left(1 + \\frac{N_D}{N_A}\\right) = x_n \\frac{N_A+N_D}{N_A} \\implies x_n = W \\frac{N_A}{N_A+N_D}$.\nSimilarly, $x_p = W \\frac{N_D}{N_A+N_D}$.\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $V$:\n$$\nV = \\frac{q}{2\\epsilon_s} \\left[ N_A \\left(W \\frac{N_D}{N_A+N_D}\\right)^2 + N_D \\left(W \\frac{N_A}{N_A+N_D}\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nV = \\frac{qW^2}{2\\epsilon_s(N_A+N_D)^2} [N_A N_D^2 + N_D N_A^2] = \\frac{qW^2}{2\\epsilon_s(N_A+N_D)^2} [N_A N_D(N_D+N_A)]\n$$\n$$\nV = \\frac{qW^2}{2\\epsilon_s} \\frac{N_A N_D}{N_A+N_D}\n$$\nSolving for $W$:\n$$\nW^2 = \\frac{2\\epsilon_s V}{q} \\frac{N_A+N_D}{N_A N_D} = \\frac{2\\epsilon_s V}{q} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)\n$$\nThus, the depletion width is:\n$$\nW = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_s V}{q} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation of $W$\nUsing the given parameters:\n$N_{A} = 7.5 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$N_{D} = 3.0 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$\\epsilon_{s} = 1.04 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F/cm}$\n$q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}$\n$V = 6.2\\ \\text{V}$\n\nFirst, calculate the term with doping concentrations.

Since $1\\ \\text{cm} = 10^4\\ \\mu\\text{m}$:\n$$\nW \\approx (1.1583 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 10^4\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 1.1583\\ \\mu\\text{m}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $W = 1.158\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n### Discussion on Scaling and Generation Current\nThe derived expression for the depletion width is $W = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_s V}{q} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)}$. The total potential $V$ is the sum of the built-in potential $V_{bi}$ and the applied reverse bias magnitude $V_R$, i.e., $V = V_{bi} + V_R$. For increasing reverse bias, $V$ increases, and for $V_R \\gg V_{bi}$, we have $V \\approx V_R$. The scaling of $W$ with reverse bias is therefore governed by its dependence on $V$. From the formula, it is clear that $W \\propto \\sqrt{V}$.\n\n(i) **Symmetric junction ($N_A = N_D = N$)**: The term in parentheses becomes $\\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{1}{N} = \\frac{2}{N}$. The expression for $W$ simplifies to $W = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\epsilon_s V}{qN}}$. The scaling remains $W \\propto \\sqrt{V}$.\n\n(ii) **One-sided junction ($N_D \\gg N_A$, a $p^{+}$-$n$ junction)**: In this case, $\\frac{1}{N_D} \\ll \\frac{1}{N_A}$, so the term in parentheses is approximately $\\frac{1}{N_A}$. The expression for $W$ becomes $W \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_s V}{qN_A}}$. Again, the scaling is $W \\propto \\sqrt{V}$. The width is determined almost entirely by the lightly doped side.\n\nThe **Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH)** model describes the process of electron-hole pair generation and recombination mediated by defects, or \"traps,\" with energy levels within the semiconductor's bandgap. Under reverse bias, the concentrations of mobile electrons ($n$) and holes ($p$) in the space charge region are much less than the intrinsic carrier concentration ($n_i$), so the recombination process is negligible. The dominant process is the thermal generation of electron-hole pairs via these trap states.\n\nThe generation current density, $J_{\\text{gen}}$, arises from the collection of all electron-hole pairs generated within the volume of the space charge region. If the generation rate per unit volume, $G$, is assumed to be constant throughout the depletion region (a reasonable assumption for midgap traps and a position-independent lifetime, as specified), then the total generation current is the rate multiplied by the charge of an electron and the volume of the region. The current density is this total current divided by the junction area, $A$:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{gen}} = \\frac{q \\cdot G \\cdot (A \\cdot W)}{A} = qGW\n$$\nThis shows that the generation current density is directly proportional to the depletion width, $J_{\\text{gen}} \\propto W$.\nSince we have established that $W$ scales with the total voltage as $W \\propto \\sqrt{V}$, it follows directly that the generation current density also scales with voltage in the same manner:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{gen}} \\propto \\sqrt{V}\n$$\nFor a large reverse bias $V_R$, this means $J_{\\text{gen}} \\propto \\sqrt{V_R}$. This explains why the reverse current of a real diode does not saturate at a constant value but instead slowly increases with the magnitude of the reverse bias voltage. This increase is attributable to the widening of the depletion region, which increases the volume where thermal generation of carriers occurs.",

The provided equations (Poisson, SRH, Boltzmann relations) are fundamental and correctly stated. The phenomenon to be analyzed, the failure of the depletion approximation under high forward bias (i.e., the onset of high injection), is a standard topic in semiconductor device physics. The numerical values for doping densities, temperature, and intrinsic concentration are realistic for a silicon device.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of fundamental principles and simplifying assumptions from which to derive a criterion and a numerical estimate.

The problem is a valid exercise in applying semiconductor physics principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n## Derivation and Analysis ##\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the breakdown of the depletion approximation. In the $\\mathrm{n}$-side of the SCR, the depletion approximation assumes that the mobile carrier concentrations, $n(x)$ and $p(x)$, are negligible compared to the ionized donor concentration, $N_D$. This simplifies Poisson's equation, as the space charge density becomes $\\rho(x) \\approx qN_{D}$. This approximation fails when the concentration of mobile carriers injected under forward bias becomes significant relative to $N_D$. The problem asks for the condition where the net mobile charge density, $|q(p(x)-n(x))|$, becomes comparable to the fixed charge density, $qN_D$. This is a sign that the mobile carriers can no longer be neglected in Poisson's equation. This regime is known as high injection.\n\nA robust criterion for the onset of high injection can be derived by considering the point of maximum recombination within the SCR. The problem states to assume this occurs where $n(x) \\approx p(x)$. Let us denote this point as $x_m$.\n\nFrom the provided Boltzmann relations, the product of carrier concentrations is given by:\n$$n(x)p(x) = n_{i}^{2}\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\phi_{p}(x)-\\phi_{n}(x)}{V_{T}}\\right)$$\nUsing the assumption that the QFL splitting is approximately the applied voltage, $\\phi_p(x)-\\phi_n(x) \\approx V$, this becomes:\n$$n(x)p(x) \\approx n_{i}^{2}\\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{V_{T}}\\right)$$\nAt the point $x_m$ where $n(x_m) \\approx p(x_m)$, we can write:\n$$p(x_m)^2 \\approx n_{i}^{2}\\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{V_{T}}\\right)$$\nSolving for the carrier density at this point:\n$$p(x_m) \\approx n(x_m) \\approx n_{i}\\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{2V_{T}}\\right)$$\nThe depletion approximation, $\\rho \\approx qN_D$, becomes invalid when the mobile carrier density is no longer negligible compared to the fixed doping density $N_D$. A standard criterion for this breakdown is when the injected carrier density becomes comparable to the background doping. Using the carrier density at the point of maximum recombination as the representative value, the onset of high injection occurs when $p(x_m)$ (or $n(x_m)$) becomes comparable to $N_D$:\n$$p(x_m) \\approx N_D$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p(x_m)$:\n$$n_{i}\\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{2V_{T}}\\right) \\approx N_D$$\nWe can now solve for the onset voltage, $V$:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{2V_{T}}\\right) \\approx \\frac{N_D}{n_{i}}$$\n$$V \\approx 2V_{T}\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_D}{n_{i}}\\right)$$\nThis formula provides the criterion for the forward voltage at which the junction enters the high injection regime.\n\nNow, we estimate this voltage numerically using the given values:\n- $N_D = 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- $n_i = 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, for which the thermal voltage is $V_T = k_B T/q \\approx 0.0259\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$V \\approx 2 \\times (0.0259\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{10^{15}}{10^{10}}\\right)$$\n$$V \\approx 0.0518\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times \\ln(10^5)$$\n$$V \\approx 0.0518\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times 5 \\ln(10)$$\nUsing $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.3026$:\n$$V \\approx 0.0518\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times 5 \\times 2.3026 \\approx 0.5964\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThus, the onset voltage for the breakdown of the depletion approximation is approximately $V \\approx 0.6\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nOnce this voltage is exceeded, the physical regime changes. The mobile carrier densities $p(x)$ and $n(x)$ are comparable to $N_D$ within a significant portion of the SCR. Consequently:\n1.  The space charge density $\\rho(x) = q(N_D + p(x) - n(x))$ must be used in Poisson's equation. The simplified form $\\rho(x) \\approx qN_D$ is no longer valid.\n2.  The recombination rate $U_{\\mathrm{SRH}}(x)$ becomes very large, and the recombination current is a significant component of the total current. Modeling this recombination accurately is crucial.\n3.  The large current flow and recombination cause the Quasi-Fermi Levels $\\phi_n(x)$ and $\\phi_p(x)$ to vary significantly with position across the SCR. The assumption that they are flat or that their splitting is constant becomes inaccurate.\n4.  A correct model requires a self-consistent numerical solution of the coupled Poisson and drift-diffusion continuity equations, incorporating the mobile carrier terms in the former and the position-dependent SRH recombination term in the latter.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The depletion approximation breaks when the injected hole density in the $\\mathrm{n}$-side SCR becomes comparable to $N_{D}$, occurring near $V\\approx 0.6\\,\\mathrm{V}$ for the stated junction; beyond this, recombination must be modeled by self-consistent Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination with position-dependent QFLs, and Poisson’s equation must include the mobile charge.**\n- **Criterion:** The criterion \"injected hole density... becomes comparable to $N_D$\" is the standard definition for the onset of high injection on the n-side. My derivation confirmed that this is equivalent to the condition $p(x_m) \\approx N_D$.\n- **Voltage:** The estimated voltage $V \\approx 0.6\\,\\mathrm{V}$ matches our calculation precisely.\n- **Modeling Implications:** The statement that one must use self-consistent SRH modeling with position-dependent QFLs and include mobile charge in Poisson's equation accurately describes the necessary changes to the model in the high injection regime.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Breakdown occurs when the SRH recombination rate equals its reverse-bias generation value, so the current saturates independent of $V$; the depletion approximation still holds and no modeling change is required.**\n- **Physics:** The SRH recombination rate in forward bias is a large positive value that grows exponentially with voltage, while the generation rate in reverse bias is a small negative value. They are never equal in the sense described. Current does not saturate; it increases rapidly.\n- **Depletion Approximation:** The statement claims the depletion approximation still holds, which is the exact opposite of what happens at the onset of high injection.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The depletion approximation never breaks down in forward bias; it only fails under avalanche multiplication in reverse bias.**\n- **Physics:** This is factually incorrect. High injection is a well-known forward-bias phenomenon characterized by the breakdown of the depletion approximation. While the approximation also fails in reverse-bias avalanche breakdown, it is not exclusive to it.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Breakdown requires the applied voltage to equal the built-in potential and an infinite density of midgap traps; once reached, recombination can be neglected because transport is purely drift-dominated in the SCR.**\n- **Condition:** The condition $V=V_{bi}$ (flat-band) occurs at a higher voltage than the onset of high injection (our calculation gives $V \\approx 0.6\\,\\mathrm{V}$, while $V_{bi} = V_T \\ln(N_A N_D/n_i^2) \\approx 0.84\\,\\mathrm{V}$). An infinite trap density is an unphysical and unnecessary condition.\n- **Implication:** In high injection, recombination current within the SCR becomes dominant, not negligible.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. The criterion is that $p(x)-n(x)\\approx 0$ everywhere inside the SCR, leading to vanishing space charge; this occurs near $V\\approx 0.6\\,\\mathrm{V}$, and modeling can ignore Poisson’s equation and treat the junction as two neutral regions.**\n- **Criterion:** $p(x) \\approx n(x)$ occurs only at one point, $x_m$, not everywhere. Elsewhere in the SCR, one carrier type dominates the other.\n- **Space Charge:** If $p(x)-n(x)\\approx 0$ were true, the space charge would be $\\rho(x) \\approx qN_D$, not vanishing. A vanishing space charge would require $N_D \\approx 0$, which is false. The statement is internally inconsistent.\n- **Modeling:** One cannot ignore Poisson's equation; on the contrary, one must solve the full version. The SCR does not become neutral.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",
