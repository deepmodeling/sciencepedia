            "problem": "A p-type–intrinsic–n-type (PIN) silicon diode has an intrinsic layer of thickness $L_i$, cross-sectional area $A$, and a spatially uniform Shockley–Read–Hall carrier lifetime $\\tau$ within the intrinsic layer. The p-type and n-type regions are assumed to be highly doped (ohmic) and much thinner than $L_i$ so that the voltage predominantly drops across the intrinsic region. During forward conduction, a high-conductivity plasma forms in the intrinsic region such that the internal electric field is negligible and the excess carrier density is spatially uniform at all times. Recombination in the intrinsic region is well described by a first-order rate $R=\\Delta n/\\tau=\\Delta p/\\tau$, where $\\Delta n=\\Delta p$ is the excess electron (and hole) concentration.\n\nStarting from the carrier continuity equation and charge conservation, and without invoking any pre-tabulated “charge-control” formulas, do the following:\n\n1) Consider a forward current step excitation: at time $t=0^{+}$, a constant forward current $I_F$ is imposed from an initial state with no stored charge in the intrinsic region. Under the assumptions above, derive the transient excess carrier density distribution $\\Delta n(x,t)$ in the intrinsic layer for $t \\ge 0$ and the corresponding total stored charge $Q(t)$ in terms of $I_F$, $A$, $L_i$, $q$, and $\\tau$, where $q$ is the elementary charge. Explicitly state the steady-state excess carrier density $\\Delta n_{\\infty}$ for $t \\to \\infty$.\n\n2) Now consider a reverse recovery experiment: the diode has been held under steady forward conduction at current $I_F$ for a long time (so that the intrinsic region has reached the steady plasma state found in part 1). At time $t=0^{+}$, the current is abruptly forced to a constant reverse value $-I_R$ (with $I_R0$). Using the same assumptions and your conservation-law derivation, obtain an analytic expression for the time $t_{rr}$ at which the total excess charge in the intrinsic region vanishes.\n\nUse the following parameter values for a numerical evaluation of $t_{rr}$:\n- $L_i = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$,\n- $A = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$,\n- $\\tau = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$,\n- $I_F = 150\\,\\mathrm{mA}$,\n- $I_R = 600\\,\\mathrm{mA}$.\n\nExpress the final value of $t_{rr}$ in nanoseconds and round your answer to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the transient behavior of a PIN diode based on a simplified charge-control model. The first step is to derive the governing differential equation from fundamental principles as specified.\n\nThe starting point is the carrier continuity equation. For excess electrons, the one-dimensional continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{\\partial J_n}{\\partial x} - R $$\nwhere $\\Delta n$ is the excess electron concentration, $J_n$ is the electron current density, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $R$ is the net recombination rate. The problem states that recombination is described by $R = \\Delta n / \\tau$.\n\nThe problem makes a crucial simplifying assumption: the excess carrier density is spatially uniform within the intrinsic region of thickness $L_i$. Thus, $\\Delta n(x,t) = \\Delta n(t)$. This implies that partial derivatives with respect to position, such as $\\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial x}$, are zero *within* the region. If the current were purely diffusion-driven ($J \\propto \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial x}$), this would lead to a contradiction. However, the problem guides us to a \"lumped element\" or charge-control model, which is derived by integrating the continuity equation over the entire volume of the intrinsic region, $V = A L_i$, where $A$ is the cross-sectional area.\n\nIntegrating the continuity equation from $x=0$ (p-i interface) to $x=L_i$ (i-n interface):\n$$ \\int_0^{L_i} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n(t)}{\\partial t} A \\, dx = \\int_0^{L_i} \\frac{A}{q} \\frac{\\partial J_n}{\\partial x} \\, dx - \\int_0^{L_i} \\frac{\\Delta n(t)}{\\tau} A \\, dx $$\nSince $\\Delta n(t)$ is not a function of $x$, we can take it out of the integrals:\n$$ A L_i \\frac{d \\Delta n(t)}{dt} = \\frac{A}{q} \\left[ J_n(L_i, t) - J_n(0, t) \\right] - \\frac{A L_i \\Delta n(t)}{\\tau} $$\nThe total excess charge stored in the intrinsic region is $Q(t) = q \\Delta n(t) A L_i$. Its time derivative is $\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = q A L_i \\frac{d \\Delta n(t)}{dt}$. Substituting these into the integrated continuity equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = \\frac{A}{q} \\left[ J_n(L_i, t) - J_n(0, t) \\right] - \\frac{Q(t)}{q\\tau} $$\n$$ \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = A \\left[ J_n(L_i, t) - J_n(0, t) \\right] - \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau} $$\nFor a PIN diode, it is assumed that the current at the p-i junction ($x=0$) is carried entirely by holes, and at the i-n junction ($x=L_i$) it is carried entirely by electrons. This means that for a total terminal current $I(t)$, the boundary conditions for the electron current are $I_n(0, t) = A J_n(0, t) = 0$ and $I_n(L_i, t) = A J_n(L_i, t) = I(t)$.\nSubstituting these boundary conditions:\n$$ \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = I(t) - 0 - \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau} $$\nThis yields the fundamental charge-control equation for the PIN diode:\n$$ I(t) = \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} + \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau} $$\nThis equation states that the terminal current $I(t)$ provides the current needed to change the stored charge ($\\frac{dQ}{dt}$) and the current needed to supply carriers lost to recombination ($\\frac{Q}{\\tau}$).\n\n**Part 1: Forward Current Step Excitation**\nFor $t \\ge 0$, a constant forward current $I_F$ is applied, so $I(t) = I_F$. The governing equation is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dQ}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} Q(t) = I_F $$\nThe initial condition is no stored charge, $Q(0)=0$. The solution to this ODE is of the form $Q(t) = Q_h(t) + Q_p(t)$, where $Q_h(t)$ is the homogeneous solution and $Q_p(t)$ is the particular solution.\nThe homogeneous equation $\\frac{dQ_h}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} Q_h = 0$ has the solution $Q_h(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau)$.\nFor a constant forcing term $I_F$, the particular solution is a constant, $Q_p(t) = K$. Substituting into the ODE gives $0 + K/\\tau = I_F$, so $K = I_F \\tau$.\nThe general solution is $Q(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau) + I_F \\tau$.\nApplying the initial condition $Q(0)=0$:\n$0 = C \\exp(0) + I_F \\tau \\implies C = -I_F \\tau$.\nThus, the total stored charge as a function of time is:\n$$ Q(t) = I_F \\tau (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)) $$\nThe excess carrier density $\\Delta n(x,t)$ is spatially uniform, so $\\Delta n(x,t) = \\Delta n(t) = Q(t) / (q A L_i)$.\n$$ \\Delta n(x,t) = \\frac{I_F \\tau}{q A L_i} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)) $$\nThe steady-state excess carrier density $\\Delta n_{\\infty}$ is the limit as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\Delta n_{\\infty} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\Delta n(x,t) = \\frac{I_F \\tau}{q A L_i} $$\n\n**Part 2: Reverse Recovery**\nThe diode starts from the steady-state condition of Part 1, so the initial stored charge at $t=0$ is $Q(0) = Q_{\\infty} = I_F \\tau$. At $t=0^{+}$, the current is switched to a constant reverse value $-I_R$, so $I(t) = -I_R$. The governing equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dQ}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} Q(t) = -I_R $$\nThe general solution is again the sum of a homogeneous and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is the same, $Q_h(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau)$. The particular solution for the constant forcing term $-I_R$ is $Q_p(t) = -I_R \\tau$.\nThe general solution is $Q(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau) - I_R \\tau$.\nApplying the initial condition $Q(0) = I_F \\tau$:\n$I_F \\tau = C \\exp(0) - I_R \\tau \\implies C = (I_F + I_R)\\tau$.\nSo, the stored charge during reverse recovery is:\n$$ Q(t) = (I_F + I_R) \\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau) - I_R \\tau $$\nThe reverse recovery time, $t_{rr}$, is the time at which the excess charge becomes zero, $Q(t_{rr})=0$.\n$$ 0 = (I_F + I_R) \\tau \\exp(-t_{rr}/\\tau) - I_R \\tau $$\n$$ I_R \\tau = (I_F + I_R) \\tau \\exp(-t_{rr}/\\tau) $$\n$$ \\frac{I_R}{I_F + I_R} = \\exp(-t_{rr}/\\tau) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_R}{I_F + I_R}\\right) = -\\frac{t_{rr}}{\\tau} $$\nSolving for $t_{rr}$:\n$$ t_{rr} = -\\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_R}{I_F + I_R}\\right) = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{I_R}{I_F + I_R}\\right)^{-1}\\right) $$\n$$ t_{rr} = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_F + I_R}{I_R}\\right) = \\tau \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{I_F}{I_R}\\right) $$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the reverse recovery time.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- $\\tau = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $I_F = 150\\,\\mathrm{mA} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- $I_R = 600\\,\\mathrm{mA} = 0.600\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $t_{rr}$:\n$$ t_{rr} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{0.150\\,\\mathrm{A}}{0.600\\,\\mathrm{A}}\\right) $$\n$$ t_{rr} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times \\ln\\left(1 + 0.25\\right) $$\n$$ t_{rr} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times \\ln(1.25) $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(1.25) \\approx 0.22314355$:\n$$ t_{rr} \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 0.22314355 \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ t_{rr} \\approx 0.4462871 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nConverting to nanoseconds ($1\\,\\mathrm{s} = 10^9\\,\\mathrm{ns}$):\n$$ t_{rr} \\approx 446.2871\\,\\mathrm{ns} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $t_{rr} = 446.3\\,\\mathrm{ns}$.",

The problem states that recombination is dominated by SRH processes, with $\\tau(T) \\approx \\big[\\sigma(T)\\, v_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)\\, N_{t}\\big]^{-1}$, where the capture cross-section is $\\sigma(T) = \\sigma_{0} \\exp\\!\\big(-E_{c}/(k_{B} T)\\big)$ and the thermal velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{th}}(T) = \\sqrt{3 k_{B} T / m^{*}} = C_v T^{1/2}$ for some constant $C_v$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\tau(T)$:\n$$ \\tau(T) = \\left[ \\left(\\sigma_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) \\left(C_v T^{1/2}\\right) N_t \\right]^{-1} = (\\sigma_0 C_v N_t)^{-1} T^{-1/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_c}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nLet $C_{\\tau} = (\\sigma_0 C_v N_t)^{-1}$ be a temperature-independent constant. Then:\n$$ \\tau(T) = C_{\\tau} T^{-1/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_c}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThe Arrhenius plot is defined by $y = \\ln t_{rr}$ versus $x = 1/T$. Let's express $y$ as a function of $T$.\n$$ y(T) = \\ln(t_{rr}(T)) = \\ln\\left( \\tau(T) \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{I_F}{I_R}\\right) \\right) $$\n$$ y(T) = \\ln(\\tau(T)) + \\ln\\left(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{I_F}{I_R}\\right)\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\tau(T)$:\n$$ y(T) = \\ln\\left(C_{\\tau} T^{-1/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_c}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{I_F}{I_R}\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ y(T) = \\ln(C_{\\tau}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(T) + \\frac{E_c}{k_B T} + \\ln\\left(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{I_F}{I_R}\\right)\\right) $$\nThe instantaneous slope of the Arrhenius plot is $S(T) = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. We can compute this using the chain rule: $S(T) = \\frac{dy/dT}{dx/dT}$.\nThe variables are $y(T)$ and $x(T) = 1/T$.\nFirst, we find the derivative of $x$ with respect to $T$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dT} = \\frac{d}{dT}(T^{-1}) = -T^{-2} $$\nNext, we find the derivative of $y$ with respect to $T$. The terms $\\ln(C_{\\tau})$ and $\\ln\\left(\\ln\\left(1 + I_F/I_R\\right)\\right)$ are constants.\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dT} = \\frac{d}{dT}\\left( \\text{const} - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(T) + \\frac{E_c}{k_B}T^{-1} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dT} = -\\frac{1}{2T} - \\frac{E_c}{k_B T^2} $$\nNow we can compute the slope $S(T)$:\n$$ S(T) = \\frac{dy/dT}{dx/dT} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2T} - \\frac{E_c}{k_B T^2}}{-T^{-2}} = T^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2T} + \\frac{E_c}{k_B T^2}\\right) $$\n$$ S(T) = \\frac{T}{2} + \\frac{E_c}{k_B} $$\nThe problem asks for this slope at $T_0 = 350\\,\\mathrm{K}$. We are given $E_c = 0.19\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $k_B = 8.617333262145 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV}/\\mathrm{K}$.\nThe units of $S(T_0)$ are Kelvin, as $\\frac{T_0}{2}$ is in Kelvin and $\\frac{E_c}{k_B}$ has units of $\\frac{\\mathrm{eV}}{\\mathrm{eV}/\\mathrm{K}} = \\mathrm{K}$.\n$$ S(T_0) = \\frac{350\\,\\mathrm{K}}{2} + \\frac{0.19\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{8.617333262145 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV}/\\mathrm{K}} $$\n$$ S(T_0) = 175\\,\\mathrm{K} + 2204.8198... \\,\\mathrm{K} $$\n$$ S(T_0) = 2379.8198... \\,\\mathrm{K} $$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $2380\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nThe first significant digit is $2$, the second is $3$, the third is $7$, and the fourth is $9$. The following digit is $8$, so we round up the $9$, which results in $2380$.",
