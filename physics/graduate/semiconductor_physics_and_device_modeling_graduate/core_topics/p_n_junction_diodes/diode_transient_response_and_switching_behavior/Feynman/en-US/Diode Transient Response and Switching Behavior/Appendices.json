            "problem": "A one-sided abrupt forward-bias step is applied at time $t=0$ to a silicon $p$-$n$ diode in series with a resistor $R_{s}$ by an ideal voltage source that instantaneously changes from $0$ to $V_{f}$. The diode is initially unbiased with zero stored charge. Model the transient response of the diode with the charge-control equation derived from the carrier continuity equation in the quasi-neutral regions, which states that the total current injected into stored charge satisfies $ \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} + \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau} = I(t) $, where $Q(t)$ is the excess minority-carrier charge stored in the diode, $\\tau$ is the effective recombination lifetime, and $I(t)$ is the total current delivered by the source through $R_{s}$. Under strong series-resistance limitation such that, during the transient, the instantaneous diode voltage remains small compared to $V_{f}$ and the source current is effectively constrained by $R_{s}$, approximate $I(t)$ by $ I(t) \\approx \\frac{V_{f}}{R_{s}} $ for $t \\ge 0$.

The turn-on delay time $t_{d}$ is defined as the time at which the conduction current first reaches a specified fraction of the steady-state conduction current, here taken to be $0.9$ of $I_{\\text{ss}}$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental charge-control description and the stated circuit constraint, derive $I_{c}(t)$ and determine $t_{d}$ satisfying $ I_{c}(t_{d}) = 0.9\\, I_{\\text{ss}} $. Express the final $t_{d}$ as a single closed-form analytic expression in seconds, as a function of $\\tau$, $R_{s}$, and $V_{f}$.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, complete, consistent, and feasible. It represents a standard analysis of diode switching behavior using the charge-control model. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe transient behavior of the diode is described by the charge-control equation, a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the excess minority-carrier charge $Q(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} + \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau} = I(t) $$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the effective recombination lifetime and $I(t)$ is the total current flowing into the diode.\n\nThe problem states that the diode is in series with a resistor $R_s$ and an ideal voltage source $V_f$ applied at $t=0$. Under the condition of strong series-resistance limitation, the total current $I(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$ is approximated as a constant value determined by the external circuit elements:\n$$ I(t) \\approx \\frac{V_f}{R_s} $$\nFor clarity, let us denote this constant forward current as $I_F = \\frac{V_f}{R_s}$. The differential equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}Q(t) = I_F $$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation. The general solution for $Q(t)$ is the sum of the homogeneous solution $Q_h(t)$ and a particular solution $Q_p(t)$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{dQ_h(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}Q_h(t) = 0$, which has the solution $Q_h(t) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)$, where $C$ is a constant of integration.\nFor the particular solution, since the forcing term $I_F$ is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution $Q_p(t) = A$. Substituting this into the inhomogeneous equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{d(A)}{dt} + \\frac{A}{\\tau} = I_F \\implies 0 + \\frac{A}{\\tau} = I_F \\implies A = I_F \\tau $$\nSo, the general solution for the charge is:\n$$ Q(t) = Q_h(t) + Q_p(t) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) + I_F \\tau $$\nThe constant $C$ is determined by the initial condition. The problem states that the diode is initially unbiased with zero stored charge, so $Q(0) = 0$. Applying this at $t=0$:\n$$ Q(0) = C \\exp(0) + I_F \\tau = C + I_F \\tau $$\n$$ 0 = C + I_F \\tau \\implies C = -I_F \\tau $$\nSubstituting the value of $C$ back into the general solution gives the specific solution for the stored charge as a function of time:\n$$ Q(t) = -I_F \\tau \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) + I_F \\tau = I_F \\tau \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) $$\nThe problem defines the conduction (recombination) current $I_c(t)$ as:\n$$ I_c(t) = \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau} $$\nSubstituting our expression for $Q(t)$:\n$$ I_c(t) = \\frac{I_F \\tau \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)}{\\tau} = I_F \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) $$\nNext, we determine the steady-state conduction current, $I_{\\text{ss}}$, by taking the limit as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$ I_{\\text{ss}} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} I_c(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ I_F \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) \\right] $$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)$ approaches $0$. Therefore:\n$$ I_{\\text{ss}} = I_F (1 - 0) = I_F = \\frac{V_f}{R_s} $$\nThis result is physically consistent: in steady-state, the stored charge is constant ($dQ/dt = 0$), so the total current must equal the recombination current.\n\nThe turn-on delay time $t_d$ is defined as the time at which the conduction current reaches $0.9$ of its steady-state value:\n$$ I_c(t_d) = 0.9 \\, I_{\\text{ss}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $I_c(t)$ and $I_{\\text{ss}}$:\n$$ I_F \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_d}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) = 0.9 \\, I_F $$\nSince $V_f$ is a forward bias, we assume $V_f > 0$, and thus $I_F \\neq 0$. We can divide both sides by $I_F$:\n$$ 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_d}{\\tau}\\right) = 0.9 $$\nWe now solve for $t_d$. Rearranging the terms:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_d}{\\tau}\\right) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_d}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) = \\ln(0.1) $$\n$$ -\\frac{t_d}{\\tau} = \\ln(0.1) $$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(x) = -\\ln(1/x)$, we have $\\ln(0.1) = \\ln(1/10) = -\\ln(10)$.\n$$ -\\frac{t_d}{\\tau} = -\\ln(10) $$\nMultiplying by $-\\tau$ yields the expression for the turn-on delay time:\n$$ t_d = \\tau \\ln(10) $$\nThe result shows that, within the assumptions of this model, the time required for the conduction current to reach a specific *fraction* of its final value is dependent only on the minority-carrier lifetime $\\tau$ and is independent of the external circuit parameters $R_s$ and $V_f$. While the problem requests the answer as a function of $\\tau$, $R_s$, and $V_f$, the derived expression correctly shows a trivial dependence on $R_s$ and $V_f$.",

The p-type and n-type regions are assumed to be highly doped (ohmic) and much thinner than $L_i$ so that the voltage predominantly drops across the intrinsic region. During forward conduction, a high-conductivity plasma forms in the intrinsic region such that the internal electric field is negligible and the excess carrier density is spatially uniform at all times.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the transient behavior of a PIN diode based on a simplified charge-control model. The first step is to derive the governing differential equation from fundamental principles as specified.\n\nThe starting point is the carrier continuity equation. For excess electrons, the one-dimensional continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{\\partial J_n}{\\partial x} - R $$\nwhere $\\Delta n$ is the excess electron concentration, $J_n$ is the electron current density, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $R$ is the net recombination rate. The problem states that recombination is described by $R = \\Delta n / \\tau$.\n\nThe problem makes a crucial simplifying assumption: the excess carrier density is spatially uniform within the intrinsic region of thickness $L_i$. Thus, $\\Delta n(x,t) = \\Delta n(t)$. This implies that partial derivatives with respect to position, such as $\\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial x}$, are zero *within* the region. If the current were purely diffusion-driven ($J \\propto \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial x}$), this would lead to a contradiction. However, the problem guides us to a \"lumped element\" or charge-control model, which is derived by integrating the continuity equation over the entire volume of the intrinsic region, $V = A L_i$, where $A$ is the cross-sectional area.\n\nIntegrating the continuity equation from $x=0$ (p-i interface) to $x=L_i$ (i-n interface):\n$$ \\int_0^{L_i} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n(t)}{\\partial t} A \\, dx = \\int_0^{L_i} \\frac{A}{q} \\frac{\\partial J_n}{\\partial x} \\, dx - \\int_0^{L_i} \\frac{\\Delta n(t)}{\\tau} A \\, dx $$\nSince $\\Delta n(t)$ is not a function of $x$, we can take it out of the integrals:\n$$ A L_i \\frac{d \\Delta n(t)}{dt} = \\frac{A}{q} \\left[ J_n(L_i, t) - J_n(0, t) \\right] - \\frac{A L_i \\Delta n(t)}{\\tau} $$\nThe total excess charge stored in the intrinsic region is $Q(t) = q \\Delta n(t) A L_i$. Its time derivative is $\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = q A L_i \\frac{d \\Delta n(t)}{dt}$.

This means that for a total terminal current $I(t)$, the boundary conditions for the electron current are $I_n(0, t) = A J_n(0, t) = 0$ and $I_n(L_i, t) = A J_n(L_i, t) = I(t)$.\nSubstituting these boundary conditions:\n$$ \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = I(t) - 0 - \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau} $$\nThis yields the fundamental charge-control equation for the PIN diode:\n$$ I(t) = \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} + \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau} $$\nThis equation states that the terminal current $I(t)$ provides the current needed to change the stored charge ($\\frac{dQ}{dt}$) and the current needed to supply carriers lost to recombination ($\\frac{Q}{\\tau}$).\n\n**Part 1: Forward Current Step Excitation**\nFor $t \\ge 0$, a constant forward current $I_F$ is applied, so $I(t) = I_F$. The governing equation is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dQ}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} Q(t) = I_F $$\nThe initial condition is no stored charge, $Q(0)=0$. The solution to this ODE is of the form $Q(t) = Q_h(t) + Q_p(t)$, where $Q_h(t)$ is the homogeneous solution and $Q_p(t)$ is the particular solution.\nThe homogeneous equation $\\frac{dQ_h}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} Q_h = 0$ has the solution $Q_h(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau)$.\nFor a constant forcing term $I_F$, the particular solution is a constant, $Q_p(t) = K$. Substituting into the ODE gives $0 + K/\\tau = I_F$, so $K = I_F \\tau$.\nThe general solution is $Q(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau) + I_F \\tau$.\nApplying the initial condition $Q(0)=0$:\n$0 = C \\exp(0) + I_F \\tau \\implies C = -I_F \\tau$.\nThus, the total stored charge as a function of time is:\n$$ Q(t) = I_F \\tau (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)) $$\nThe excess carrier density $\\Delta n(x,t)$ is spatially uniform, so $\\Delta n(x,t) = \\Delta n(t) = Q(t) / (q A L_i)$.\n$$ \\Delta n(x,t) = \\frac{I_F \\tau}{q A L_i} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)) $$\nThe steady-state excess carrier density $\\Delta n_{\\infty}$ is the limit as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\Delta n_{\\infty} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\Delta n(x,t) = \\frac{I_F \\tau}{q A L_i} $$\n\n**Part 2: Reverse Recovery**\nThe diode starts from the steady-state condition of Part 1, so the initial stored charge at $t=0$ is $Q(0) = Q_{\\infty} = I_F \\tau$. At $t=0^{+}$, the current is switched to a constant reverse value $-I_R$, so $I(t) = -I_R$. The governing equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dQ}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} Q(t) = -I_R $$\nThe general solution is again the sum of a homogeneous and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is the same, $Q_h(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau)$. The particular solution for the constant forcing term $-I_R$ is $Q_p(t) = -I_R \\tau$.\nThe general solution is $Q(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau) - I_R \\tau$.\nApplying the initial condition $Q(0) = I_F \\tau$:\n$I_F \\tau = C \\exp(0) - I_R \\tau \\implies C = (I_F + I_R)\\tau$.\nSo, the stored charge during reverse recovery is:\n$$ Q(t) = (I_F + I_R) \\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau) - I_R \\tau $$\nThe reverse recovery time, $t_{rr}$, is the time at which the excess charge becomes zero, $Q(t_{rr})=0$.\n$$ 0 = (I_F + I_R) \\tau \\exp(-t_{rr}/\\tau) - I_R \\tau $$\n$$ I_R \\tau = (I_F + I_R) \\tau \\exp(-t_{rr}/\\tau) $$\n$$ \\frac{I_R}{I_F + I_R} = \\exp(-t_{rr}/\\tau) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_R}{I_F + I_R}\\right) = -\\frac{t_{rr}}{\\tau} $$\nSolving for $t_{rr}$:\n$$ t_{rr} = -\\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_R}{I_F + I_R}\\right) = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{I_R}{I_F + I_R}\\right)^{-1}\\right) $$\n$$ t_{rr} = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_F + I_R}{I_R}\\right) = \\tau \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{I_F}{I_R}\\right) $$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the reverse recovery time.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- $\\tau = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $I_F = 150\\,\\mathrm{mA} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- $I_R = 600\\,\\mathrm{mA} = 0.600\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $t_{rr}$:\n$$ t_{rr} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{0.150\\,\\mathrm{A}}{0.600\\,\\mathrm{A}}\\right) $$\n$$ t_{rr} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times \\ln\\left(1 + 0.25\\right) $$\n$$ t_{rr} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times \\ln(1.25) $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(1.25) \\approx 0.22314355$:\n$$ t_{rr} \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 0.22314355 \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ t_{rr} \\approx 0.4462871 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nConverting to nanoseconds ($1\\,\\mathrm{s} = 10^9\\,\\mathrm{ns}$):\n$$ t_{rr} \\approx 446.2871\\,\\mathrm{ns} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $t_{rr} = 446.3\\,\\mathrm{ns}$.",

Small-Signal Model of the Diode Junction**\nThe behavior of the minority-carrier charge stored in the diode junction, $Q_D$, is described by the charge control equation:\n$$I_D(t) = \\frac{dQ_D(t)}{dt} + \\frac{Q_D(t)}{\\tau}$$\nwhere $I_D(t)$ is the current flowing into the junction and $\\tau$ is the minority-carrier lifetime.\nUnder steady-state (DC) conditions, $\\frac{dQ_D}{dt}=0$, so the stored charge is $Q_0 = I_0 \\tau$.\n\nWe linearize the system around the DC operating point $(I_0, V_{D0})$, where $V_{D0}$ is the DC voltage across the junction. Let the total quantities be composed of a DC and a small-signal AC component: $I_D(t) = I_0 + i_d(t)$, $V_D(t) = V_{D0} + v_d(t)$, and $Q_D(t) = Q_0 + q_d(t)$. Substituting these into the charge control equation:\n$$I_0 + i_d(t) = \\frac{d(Q_0 + q_d(t))}{dt} + \\frac{Q_0 + q_d(t)}{\\tau} = \\frac{dq_d(t)}{dt} + \\frac{Q_0}{\\tau} + \\frac{q_d(t)}{\\tau}$$\nSubtracting the DC relation $I_0 = Q_0/\\tau$, we obtain the small-signal charge control equation:\n$$i_d(t) = \\frac{dq_d(t)}{dt} + \\frac{q_d(t)}{\\tau}$$\nThe small-signal charge $q_d(t)$ is related to the small-signal junction voltage $v_d(t)$ through the diffusion capacitance $C_d$. The diffusion capacitance is defined as the rate of change of stored charge with respect to junction voltage at the operating point:\n$$C_d = \\left.\\frac{dQ_D}{dV_D}\\right|_{V_{D0}} = \\left.\\frac{d(\\tau I_D)}{dV_D}\\right|_{V_{D0}} = \\tau \\left.\\frac{dI_D}{dV_D}\\right|_{V_{D0}}$$\nThe term $\\left.\\frac{dI_D}{dV_D}\\right|_{V_{D0}}$ is the small-signal junction conductance, which we denote as $g_d$. Thus, $C_d = g_d \\tau$. For small signals, we have the linear relationship $q_d(t) = C_d v_d(t) = g_d \\tau v_d(t)$.\n\nSubstituting this into the small-signal charge control equation gives the relationship between the small-signal junction current and voltage:\n$$i_d(t) = \\frac{d(g_d \\tau v_d(t))}{dt} + \\frac{g_d \\tau v_d(t)}{\\tau} = g_d \\tau \\frac{dv_d(t)}{dt} + g_d v_d(t)$$\nThis equation describes the small-signal model of the diode junction as a parallel combination of a conductance $g_d$ and the diffusion capacitance $C_d = g_d \\tau$. The small-signal admittance of the junction is $Y_d(s) = g_d + s C_d = g_d(1 + s\\tau)$.\n\n**2.2. Full Circuit Analysis**\nThe full circuit consists of the applied voltage source in series with the external inductor $L$, the series resistor $R_s$, and the diode junction. Let $i(t)$ be the small-signal current flowing through the entire series circuit. By Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), the small-signal applied voltage, $\\Delta V u(t)$, equals the sum of voltage drops across each component:\n$$\\Delta V u(t) = L \\frac{di(t)}{dt} + R_s i(t) + v_d(t)$$\nHere, $v_d(t)$ is the small-signal voltage across the diode junction. The small-signal current $i(t)$ flowing through the external components is the same as the current $i_d(t)$ flowing into the junction.\n\nIt is convenient to analyze the circuit in the Laplace domain (with complex frequency $s$). The KVL equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta V}{s} = sL \\, i(s) + R_s i(s) + v_d(s)$$\nThe small-signal junction voltage $v_d(s)$ is related to the current $i(s)$ by the junction impedance $Z_d(s) = 1/Y_d(s)$:\n$$v_d(s) = Z_d(s) i(s) = \\frac{1}{g_d(1 + s\\tau)} i(s)$$\nSubstituting this into the KVL equation:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta V}{s} = \\left( sL + R_s + \\frac{1}{g_d(1 + s\\tau)} \\right) i(s)$$\nThe natural response of the system is determined by the poles of the transfer function, which are the roots of the expression for the total impedance of the passive network set to zero. Thus, the characteristic equation is:\n$$sL + R_s + \\frac{1}{g_d(1 + s\\tau)} = 0$$\nTo find the polynomial form, we multiply by $g_d(1+s\\tau)$:\n$$(sL + R_s)g_d(1 + s\\tau) + 1 = 0$$\nExpanding this expression:\n$$sLg_d + s^2Lg_d\\tau + R_sg_d + sR_sg_d\\tau + 1 = 0$$\nGrouping terms by powers of $s$, we obtain the standard quadratic form $As^2 + Bs + C = 0$:\n$$(Lg_d\\tau)s^2 + (Lg_d + R_sg_d\\tau)s + (1 + R_sg_d) = 0$$\n\n**2.3. Condition for Underdamped Response**\nThe system response is underdamped, exhibiting ringing, when the roots of the characteristic equation are a complex-conjugate pair. This occurs when the discriminant of the quadratic equation, $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$, is negative. The transition between response types (overdamped/underdamped) occurs at the critical damping condition, where the discriminant is zero.\n$$B^2 - 4AC = 0$$\nSubstituting the coefficients $A = Lg_d\\tau$, $B = Lg_d + R_sg_d\\tau$, and $C = 1 + R_sg_d$:\n$$(Lg_d + R_sg_d\\tau)^2 - 4(Lg_d\\tau)(1 + R_sg_d) = 0$$\nWe need to solve this equation for $L$.\n$$g_d^2(L + R_s\\tau)^2 - 4Lg_d\\tau(1 + R_sg_d) = 0$$\nSince $g_d > 0$ for a forward-biased diode, we can divide by $g_d$:\n$$g_d(L^2 + 2LR_s\\tau + R_s^2\\tau^2) - 4L\\tau(1 + R_sg_d) = 0$$\n$$g_d L^2 + 2g_dLR_s\\tau + g_dR_s^2\\tau^2 - 4L\\tau - 4Lg_dR_s\\tau = 0$$\nCollecting terms in powers of $L$ gives a quadratic equation for $L$:\n$$g_d L^2 + (2g_dR_s\\tau - 4\\tau - 4g_dR_s\\tau)L + g_dR_s^2\\tau^2 = 0$$\n$$g_d L^2 - (2g_dR_s\\tau + 4\\tau)L + g_dR_s^2\\tau^2 = 0$$\n$$g_d L^2 - 2\\tau(g_dR_s + 2)L + g_dR_s^2\\tau^2 = 0$$\nWe solve for $L$ using the quadratic formula, $L = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$L = \\frac{2\\tau(g_dR_s + 2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2\\tau(g_dR_s + 2))^2 - 4(g_d)(g_dR_s^2\\tau^2)}}{2g_d}$$\nSimplifying the discriminant inside the square root:\n$$4\\tau^2(g_dR_s + 2)^2 - 4g_d^2R_s^2\\tau^2 = 4\\tau^2\\left[(g_dR_s + 2)^2 - (g_dR_s)^2\\right]$$\n$$= 4\\tau^2\\left[g_d^2R_s^2 + 4g_dR_s + 4 - g_d^2R_s^2\\right] = 4\\tau^2(4g_dR_s + 4) = 16\\tau^2(g_dR_s + 1)$$\nThe square root is $\\sqrt{16\\tau^2(g_dR_s + 1)} = 4\\tau\\sqrt{g_dR_s + 1}$. Substituting back:\n$$L = \\frac{2\\tau(g_dR_s + 2) \\pm 4\\tau\\sqrt{g_dR_s + 1}}{2g_d} = \\frac{\\tau(g_dR_s + 2) \\pm 2\\tau\\sqrt{g_dR_s + 1}}{g_d}$$\n$$L = \\frac{\\tau}{g_d}\\left( g_dR_s + 2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{g_dR_s + 1} \\right)$$\nThe term in the parenthesis can be recognized as a perfect square: $g_dR_s + 2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{g_dR_s + 1} = (\\sqrt{g_dR_s + 1} \\pm 1)^2$.\nThis yields the two critical inductance values that delimit the underdamped regime:\n$$L_{lower} = \\frac{\\tau}{g_d}\\left( \\sqrt{g_dR_s + 1} - 1 \\right)^2$$\n$$L_{upper} = \\frac{\\tau}{g_d}\\left( \\sqrt{g_dR_s + 1} + 1 \\right)^2$$\nThe discriminant $B^2 - 4AC$ is a quadratic function of $L$ that opens upwards, so it is negative for values of $L$ between these two roots. Thus, the underdamped regime is defined by $L_{lower} < L < L_{upper}$. The problem asks for the two threshold values.",
