Substituting $L_p$ into the differential equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}\\Delta p(x)}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{1}{L_p^2}\\Delta p(x) = 0\n$$\nTo solve this equation, we assume a solution of the form $\\Delta p(x) = \\exp(rx)$ and form the characteristic equation:\n$$\nr^2 - \\frac{1}{L_p^2} = 0\n$$\nThe roots of the characteristic equation are:\n$$\nr = \\pm \\frac{1}{L_p}\n$$\nThe general solution to the differential equation is a linear combination of the two independent solutions corresponding to these roots:\n$$\n\\Delta p(x) = C_{1}\\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right) + C_{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nNext, we apply the boundary conditions.\n\nThe first boundary condition is that the solution must be physically admissible in the semi-infinite domain $x \\in [0, \\infty)$. This means the excess carrier concentration must not diverge to infinity as $x \\to \\infty$. Far from the junction, all injected excess carriers will have recombined, so the excess concentration must approach zero. Mathematically:\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\Delta p(x) = 0\n$$\nApplying this to the general solution:\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\left[ C_{1}\\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right) + C_{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right) \\right] = 0\n$$\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(x/L_p)$ grows without bound, while the term $\\exp(-x/L_p)$ decays to zero. For the overall limit to be zero, the coefficient of the diverging term, $C_1$, must be zero. Therefore, we must set $C_1=0$.\nThis simplifies the solution to:\n$$\n\\Delta p(x) = C_{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right)\n$$\nThe second boundary condition is at $x=0$, where the excess hole concentration is given as $\\Delta p(0)$. Applying this condition:\n$$\n\\Delta p(0) = C_{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{L_p}\\right) = C_2 \\cdot 1\n$$\nThis gives $C_2 = \\Delta p(0)$.\n\nSubstituting the value of $C_2$ back into the simplified solution, we obtain the particular solution for the excess hole concentration profile:\n$$\n\\Delta p(x) = \\Delta p(0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we express the solution in terms of the original given parameters, $D_p$ and $\\tau_p$, by substituting back $L_p = \\sqrt{D_{p}\\tau_{p}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta p(x) = \\Delta p(0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{D_{p}\\tau_{p}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression describes an exponential decay of the excess minority carrier concentration from its value at the edge of the depletion region into the quasi-neutral $n$-region, with a characteristic decay length equal to the hole diffusion length $L_p$.",

Minority Carrier Distribution in the Base**\n\nUnder low-level injection in the uniformly doped $p$-type base with acceptor concentration $N_{A,B}$, the majority hole concentration is $p_p(x) \\approx N_{A,B}$. From the mass-action law, the equilibrium minority electron concentration is $n_{p0} = n_i^2 / p_{p0} \\approx n_i^2 / N_{A,B}$.\n\nWith a forward bias $V_{BE}$ across the emitter-base junction, the minority carrier concentration at the edge of the depletion region is increased. By the law of the junction (derived from Boltzmann statistics), the electron concentration at $x=0$ is given by:\n$$n_p(0) = n_{p0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{q V_{BE}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe excess minority electron concentration at $x=0$ is therefore:\n$$\\delta n_p(0) = n_p(0) - n_{p0} = n_{p0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{q V_{BE}}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_{A,B}} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{q V_{BE}}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nThis expression explicitly shows the dependence of the excess electron concentration at the base edge on the base doping $N_{A,B}$ and the forward bias voltage $V_{BE}$.\n\nIn the quasi-neutral base, the electric field is assumed to be negligible. The steady-state continuity equation for the excess minority electrons, $\\delta n_p(x) = n_p(x) - n_{p0}$, is given by the balance between diffusion and recombination:\n$$D_{n,B} \\frac{d^2(\\delta n_p(x))}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta n_p(x)}{\\tau_{n,B}} = 0$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\\frac{d^2(\\delta n_p(x))}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta n_p(x)}{L_{n,B}^2} = 0$$\nwhere $L_{n,B} = \\sqrt{D_{n,B} \\tau_{n,B}}$ is the minority electron diffusion length in the base. The general solution to this second-order ordinary differential equation is:\n$$\\delta n_p(x) = C_1 \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_{n,B}}\\right) + C_2 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_{n,B}}\\right)$$\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by the boundary conditions at $x=0$ and $x=W_B$.\n- At $x=0$: $\\delta n_p(0) = C_1$. So, $C_1 = \\delta n_p(0)$.\n- At $x=W_B$: The base-collector junction is strongly reverse-biased, which sweeps electrons into the collector, causing the electron concentration to be nearly zero. Thus, $n_p(W_B) \\approx 0$. The excess concentration is $\\delta n_p(W_B) = n_p(W_B) - n_{p0} \\approx -n_{p0}$. For any significant forward bias $V_{BE}$, we have $\\delta n_p(0) \\gg n_{p0}$, so we can use the excellent approximation $\\delta n_p(W_B) \\approx 0$.\nApplying this second boundary condition:\n$$\\delta n_p(W_B) = \\delta n_p(0) \\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_{n,B}}\\right) + C_2 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_{n,B}}\\right) = 0$$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$C_2 = -\\delta n_p(0) \\frac{\\cosh(W_B/L_{n,B})}{\\sinh(W_B/L_{n,B})}$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution and using the identity $\\sinh(A-B) = \\sinh(A)\\cosh(B) - \\cosh(A)\\sinh(B)$, we obtain the excess electron distribution in the base:\n$$\\delta n_p(x) = \\delta n_p(0) \\frac{\\sinh((W_B-x)/L_{n,B})}{\\sinh(W_B/L_{n,B})}$$\n\n**2. Emitter Current Components and Joint Governance**\n\nThe total emitter current density, $J_E$, is the sum of two components at the junction: the electron current density injected into the base, $J_{n,E}$, and the hole current density back-injected into the emitter, $J_{p,E}$.\n\nThe electron current is due to diffusion, as the electric field is negligible in the base. The electron current density is $J_n(x) = q D_{n,B} \\frac{d n_p(x)}{dx} = q D_{n,B} \\frac{d (\\delta n_p(x))}{dx}$.\n$$J_n(x) = q D_{n,B} \\delta n_p(0) \\frac{-\\cosh((W_B-x)/L_{n,B})/L_{n,B}}{\\sinh(W_B/L_{n,B})}$$\nThe electron current injected from the emitter into the base is evaluated at $x=0$:\n$$J_{n,E} = J_n(0) = -q D_{n,B} \\frac{\\delta n_p(0)}{L_{n,B}} \\frac{\\cosh(W_B/L_{n,B})}{\\sinh(W_B/L_{n,B})} = - \\frac{q D_{n,B}}{L_{n,B}} \\coth\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_{n,B}}\\right) \\delta n_p(0)$$\nHere, the electron flow is in the $+x$ direction, but the conventional current is typically defined in the direction of hole flow. However, the problem asks about electron injection, so let's consider the magnitude of the current density of electrons flowing into the base:\n$$|J_{n,E}| = \\frac{q D_{n,B}}{L_{n,B}} \\coth\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_{n,B}}\\right) \\frac{n_i^2}{N_{A,B}} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{q V_{BE}}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nNow, we consider the hole current back-injected into the heavily doped $n^{+}$ emitter. Assuming the emitter is long ($W_E \\gg L_{p,E}$, where $L_{p,E}$ is the hole diffusion length in the emitter), the analysis is analogous. The excess hole concentration at the emitter edge is $\\delta p_n = (n_i^2/N_{D,E})(\\exp(qV_{BE}/k_B T) - 1)$. The resulting diffusion current density of holes into the emitter is:\n$$|J_{p,E}| = \\frac{q D_{p,E}}{L_{p,E}} \\frac{n_i^2}{N_{D,E}} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{q V_{BE}}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nwhere $D_{p,E}$ and $L_{p,E}$ are the hole diffusion coefficient and length in the emitter.\n\nThe joint governance of $N_{D,E}$ and $W_B$ on minority electron injection is best understood by examining the emitter injection efficiency, $\\gamma_E = |J_{n,E}| / (|J_{n,E}| + |J_{p,E}|)$. A high efficiency means most of the emitter current is due to the desired electron injection. This requires the ratio $|J_{p,E}| / |J_{n,E}|$ to be small. The explicit relation governing this partitioning is:\n$$\\frac{|J_{p,E}|}{|J_{n,E}|} = \\frac{\\frac{q D_{p,E}}{L_{p,E} N_{D,E}}}{\\frac{q D_{n,B}}{L_{n,B} N_{A,B}} \\coth\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_{n,B}}\\right)} = \\frac{D_{p,E} L_{n,B} N_{A,B}}{D_{n,B} L_{p,E} N_{D,E}} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_{n,B}}\\right)$$\nThis relation demonstrates how $N_{D,E}$ and $W_B$ jointly control the current partitioning.\n- To maximize electron injection relative to hole back-injection (i.e., to minimize this ratio), the emitter doping $N_{D,E}$ must be made as large as possible relative to the base doping $N_{A,B}$.\n- The base width $W_B$ influences the ratio through the term $\\tanh(W_B/L_{n,B})$. For a narrow base where $W_B \\ll L_{n,B}$, $\\tanh(W_B/L_{n,B}) \\approx W_B/L_{n,B}$. In this limit, a smaller base width $W_B$ further reduces the unwanted hole current ratio, improving injection efficiency.\n\n**3. Base Transport Factor (BTF)**\n\nThe Base Transport Factor, $\\alpha_T$, is the fraction of injected electrons that successfully traverse the base and are collected at the base-collector junction, without recombining in the base. It is the ratio of the electron current density at the collector edge, $J_n(W_B)$, to the electron current density injected at the emitter edge, $J_n(0)$.\n$$J_n(0) = - q D_{n,B} \\frac{\\delta n_p(0)}{L_{n,B}} \\coth\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_{n,B}}\\right)$$\n$$J_n(W_B) = - q D_{n,B} \\frac{d (\\delta n_p(x))}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=W_B} = - q D_{n,B} \\frac{\\delta n_p(0)}{L_{n,B}} \\frac{\\cosh(0)}{\\sinh(W_B/L_{n,B})} = - \\frac{q D_{n,B} \\delta n_p(0)}{L_{n,B} \\sinh(W_B/L_{n,B})}$$\nTaking the ratio of their magnitudes:\n$$\\alpha_T = \\frac{|J_n(W_B)|}{|J_n(0)|} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sinh(W_B/L_{n,B})}}{\\frac{\\cosh(W_B/L_{n,B})}{\\sinh(W_B/L_{n,B})}} = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(W_B/L_{n,B})}$$\nThe exact expression for the Base Transport Factor is therefore:\n$$\\alpha_T = \\mathrm{sech}\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_{n,B}}\\right)$$\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nGiven the parameters:\n$W_{B} = 0.40\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.40 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n$D_{n,B} = 25\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$\n$\\tau_{n,B} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the electron diffusion length in the base, $L_{n,B}$:\n$$L_{n,B} = \\sqrt{D_{n,B} \\tau_{n,B}} = \\sqrt{(25\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}) \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{s})} = \\sqrt{100 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2} = \\sqrt{1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2}$$\n$$L_{n,B} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm} = 1.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless ratio $W_B / L_{n,B}$:\n$$\\frac{W_B}{L_{n,B}} = \\frac{0.40 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm}} = 0.40$$\nFinally, we compute the Base Transport Factor, $\\alpha_T$:\n$$\\alpha_T = \\mathrm{sech}(0.40) = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(0.40)}$$\nUsing the definition $\\cosh(x) = (\\exp(x) + \\exp(-x))/2$:\n$$\\cosh(0.40) = \\frac{\\exp(0.40) + \\exp(-0.40)}{2} \\approx \\frac{1.4918247 + 0.6703200}{2} = \\frac{2.1621447}{2} = 1.08107235$$\n$$\\alpha_T = \\frac{1}{1.08107235} \\approx 0.9250044$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the Base Transport Factor is $0.9250$.",
