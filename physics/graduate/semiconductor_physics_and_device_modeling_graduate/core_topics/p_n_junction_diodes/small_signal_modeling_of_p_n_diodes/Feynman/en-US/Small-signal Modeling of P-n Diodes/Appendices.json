The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the small-signal diffusion capacitance $C_{\\text{diff}}$ and the total stored charge $Q$ at a specific DC operating point, and then to evaluate them numerically.\n\nThe small-signal diffusion capacitance is defined as the rate of change of the stored excess minority charge $Q$ with respect to the applied voltage $V$, evaluated at the DC operating point $(V_{0}, I_{0})$:\n$$C_{\\text{diff}} = \\left. \\frac{dQ}{dV} \\right|_{V=V_{0}}$$\n\nThe problem provides the quasi-static charge-control relation for a long-base diode, which connects the stored charge $Q$ to the diode current $I$:\n$$Q = \\tau I$$\nHere, $\\tau$ is the effective excess minority carrier transit time, which is treated as a constant under the given assumptions.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $Q$ into the definition of $C_{\\text{diff}}$, we get:\n$$C_{\\text{diff}} = \\frac{d(\\tau I)}{dV} = \\tau \\frac{dI}{dV}$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{dI}{dV}$ is the small-signal dynamic conductance of the diode, denoted by $g_{d}$. Thus, we have:\n$$C_{\\text{diff}} = \\tau g_{d}$$\n\nTo find $g_{d}$, we differentiate the ideal diode current-voltage relationship with respect to $V$:\n$$I(V) = I_{S}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{n V_{T}}\\right)-1\\right]$$\n$$g_{d} = \\frac{dI}{dV} = \\frac{d}{dV} \\left( I_{S}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{n V_{T}}\\right)-1\\right] \\right) = I_{S} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{n V_{T}}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{n V_{T}}$$\n\nWe need to evaluate this conductance at the DC operating point defined by the current $I_{0}$ and voltage $V_{0}$. At this point:\n$$g_{d}(V_{0}) = \\frac{I_{S}}{n V_{T}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{0}}{n V_{T}}\\right)$$\n\nFrom the original diode equation evaluated at the operating point, we have:\n$$I_{0} = I_{S}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{0}}{n V_{T}}\\right)-1\\right]$$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$I_{S} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{0}}{n V_{T}}\\right) = I_{0} + I_{S}$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $g_{d}(V_{0})$:\n$$g_{d}(V_{0}) = \\frac{I_{0} + I_{S}}{n V_{T}}$$\n\nFor a forward-biased diode, the forward current $I_{0}$ (given as $1\\ \\mathrm{mA}$) is many orders of magnitude larger than the reverse saturation current $I_{S}$ (typically in the pA to nA range for silicon diodes). Therefore, we can make the highly accurate approximation $I_{0} + I_{S} \\approx I_{0}$.\n$$g_{d} \\approx \\frac{I_{0}}{n V_{T}}$$\n\nNow we substitute this simplified expression for the conductance back into our equation for the diffusion capacitance:\n$$C_{\\text{diff}} \\approx \\tau \\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{n V_{T}}\\right) = \\frac{\\tau I_{0}}{n V_{T}}$$\nThis is the desired symbolic expression for $C_{\\text{diff}}$ in terms of the given parameters.\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical value of $C_{\\text{diff}}$. First, we must find the thermal voltage $V_{T}$ at $T=300\\ \\mathrm{K}$:\n$$V_{T} = \\frac{k_{B} T}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K})(300\\ \\mathrm{K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n\nNow we can compute $C_{\\text{diff}}$ using the given numerical values:\n- $\\tau = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n- $I_{0} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A}$\n- $n = 1$\n- $V_{T} \\approx 0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n\n$$C_{\\text{diff}} \\approx \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s})(1 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A})}{(1)(0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V})} \\approx 3.86817 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{F}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$C_{\\text{diff}} \\approx 3.87 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{F}$$\n\nFinally, we need to estimate the total stored excess minority carrier charge $Q$ at the operating point. We use the charge-control relation directly, evaluated at the DC current $I_{0}$:\n$$Q = \\tau I_{0}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$Q = (1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s})(1 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A}) = 1 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}$$\nTo express this with three significant figures, we write:\n$$Q = 1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}$$\n\nThe required pair of values is $(C_{\\text{diff}}, Q)$.",

It describes a standard problem in semiconductor device physics concerning the small-signal AC response of a p-n diode superimposed on a DC operating point. All provided parameters and definitions are standard and physically consistent. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is structured into three parts as requested by the problem.\n\n$1)$ Derivation of the small-signal terminal equation and time constant.\n\nLet the total voltage across the diode terminals be $V(t)$ and the total current flowing into the diode be $I_{\\text{total}}(t)$. At a steady forward DC operating point $(I_0, V_0)$, we introduce small time-varying perturbations. The total voltage and current can be expressed as the sum of their DC and AC components:\n$$V(t) = V_0 + v(t)$$\n$$I_{\\text{total}}(t) = I_0 + i(t)$$\nwhere $v(t)$ and $i(t)$ are the small-signal voltage and current, respectively.\n\nThe total current flowing through a diode has two components: the conduction current $I(V)$ governed by carrier transport across the junction, and the displacement current due to the change in stored charge $Q(V)$. The fundamental equation for the total terminal current is given by the principle of charge conservation:\n$$I_{\\text{total}}(t) = I(V(t)) + \\frac{dQ(V(t))}{dt}$$\nHere, $Q(V)$ is the total charge stored in the device, which is the sum of the depletion charge $Q_j(V)$ and the diffusion (or minority carrier storage) charge $Q_{\\text{diff}}(V)$.\n$$Q(V) = Q_j(V) + Q_{\\text{diff}}(V)$$\n\nTo find the small-signal model, we linearize the functions $I(V)$ and $Q(V)$ around the DC operating point $V_0$ using a first-order Taylor expansion.\nFor the conduction current $I(V(t))$:\n$$I(V(t)) = I(V_0 + v(t)) \\approx I(V_0) + \\left.\\frac{dI}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} v(t) = I_0 + g_d v(t)$$\nwhere $g_d \\equiv \\left.\\frac{dI}{dV}\\right|_{V_0}$ is the small-signal diode conductance.\n\nFor the stored charge $Q(V(t))$:\n$$Q(V(t)) = Q(V_0 + v(t)) \\approx Q(V_0) + \\left.\\frac{dQ}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} v(t)$$\nThe derivative term $\\frac{dQ(V(t))}{dt}$ becomes:\n$$\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( Q(V_0) + \\left.\\frac{dQ}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} v(t) \\right)$$\nSince $Q(V_0)$ is a constant DC charge, its time derivative is zero. Thus,\n$$\\frac{dQ}{dt} \\approx \\left.\\frac{dQ}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}$$\nThe term $\\left.\\frac{dQ}{dV}\\right|_{V_0}$ represents the total small-signal capacitance of the diode, $C_{\\text{total}}$. It is the sum of the depletion capacitance $C_j$ and the diffusion capacitance $C_{\\text{diff}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = \\left.\\frac{dQ}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} = \\left.\\frac{d(Q_j + Q_{\\text{diff}})}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} = \\left.\\frac{dQ_j}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} + \\left.\\frac{dQ_{\\text{diff}}}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} = C_j + C_{\\text{diff}}$$\nSo, the displacement current is:\n$$\\frac{dQ}{dt} = (C_j + C_{\\text{diff}}) \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}$$\n\nSubstituting the linearized expressions back into the total current equation:\n$$I_{\\text{total}}(t) \\approx (I_0 + g_d v(t)) + (C_j + C_{\\text{diff}}) \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}$$\nThe total current is $I_{\\text{total}}(t) = I_0 + i(t)$. The DC components on both sides must be equal ($I_0 = I_0$), leaving the relationship for the small-signal components. The small-signal current $i(t)$ flowing *into* the diode is therefore:\n$$i(t) = g_d v(t) + (C_j + C_{\\text{diff}}) \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}$$\nThe problem states that a small AC current source $i_{\\text{inj}}(t)$ is connected in parallel with the diode. This source drives the small-signal response of the diode, so the current flowing into the small-signal equivalent circuit of the diode is precisely $i_{\\text{inj}}(t)$. Thus, $i(t) = i_{\\text{inj}}(t)$.\n$$i_{\\text{inj}}(t) = g_d v(t) + (C_j + C_{\\text{diff}}) \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}$$\nThis is the first-order linear time-invariant (LTI) differential equation for the small-signal voltage $v(t)$ in response to the injected current $i_{\\text{inj}}(t)$.\n\nTo identify the time constant, we rearrange this equation into the standard form $\\tau \\frac{dy}{dt} + y = K x(t)$. Dividing by the conductance $g_d$:\n$$\\frac{C_j + C_{\\text{diff}}}{g_d} \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} + v(t) = \\frac{1}{g_d} i_{\\text{inj}}(t)$$\nBy inspection, the coefficient of the derivative term $\\frac{dv(t)}{dt}$ is the effective one-pole time constant, $\\tau$.\n$$\\tau = \\frac{C_j + C_{\\text{diff}}}{g_d}$$\nThis corresponds to the time constant of a parallel RC circuit, where the resistance is the small-signal dynamic resistance $R_d = 1/g_d$ and the capacitance is the total small-signal capacitance $C_{\\text{total}} = C_j + C_{\\text{diff}}$.\n\n$2)$ Calculation of the equivalent small-signal time constant.\n\nWe are given the following measured parameter values:\n- Small-signal conductance $g_d = 0.050$ S\n- Diffusion capacitance $C_{\\text{diff}} = 0.480$ nF $= 0.480 \\times 10^{-9}$ F\n- Depletion capacitance $C_j = 20$ pF $= 20 \\times 10^{-12}$ F\n\nFirst, we calculate the total small-signal capacitance $C_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = C_j + C_{\\text{diff}} = (20 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ F}) + (0.480 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ F})$$\nTo add these values, we express them in the same units, for example, Farads:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = (0.020 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ F}) + (0.480 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ F}) = 0.500 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ F}$$\nNow, we compute the time constant $\\tau$ using the derived formula:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{C_{\\text{total}}}{g_d} = \\frac{0.500 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ F}}{0.050 \\text{ S}}$$\n$$\\tau = \\frac{5.00 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ F}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ S}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ s}$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\tau = 1.000 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ s}$$\n\n$3)$ Physical interpretation of the time constant.\n\nThe derived time constant $\\tau = R_d (C_j + C_{\\text{diff}})$ characterizes the fundamental speed of the diode's electrical response to small perturbations around its DC operating point $V_0$.\n- It represents the time required for the diode's terminal voltage to change by approximately $63.2\\%$ (a factor of $1 - 1/e$) of its total final change in response to a step-like change in the injected current. A larger $\\tau$ signifies a slower device.\n- This time delay is physically caused by the need to either supply or remove charge from the two storage elements within the diode structure before a new steady-state voltage can be established. The total charge to be moved per unit voltage change is given by the total capacitance $C_{\\text{total}} = C_j + C_{\\text{diff}}$.\n  - $C_j$ accounts for the change in charge stored in the fixed donor and acceptor ions that form the boundaries of the space-charge (depletion) region.\n  - $C_{\\text{diff}}$ accounts for the change in the population of minority carriers (e.g., electrons in the p-side) injected and stored in the quasi-neutral regions. In forward bias, this is typically the dominant charge storage mechanism.\n- The rate at which this charge can be supplied or removed is limited by the available conduction path, whose ease of passage is quantified by the small-signal conductance $g_d$ (or its inverse, the dynamic resistance $R_d = 1/g_d$). A higher conductance provides a \"wider path\" for current, allowing the capacitances to charge or discharge faster, thus leading to a smaller time constant.\n- Therefore, the time constant is a direct measure of the interplay between charge storage capacity and conduction efficiency, and it sets the upper limit on the frequency at which the diode can effectively operate as a rectifying or switching element. The cutoff frequency for the diode's operation is inversely proportional to this time constant, e.g., $f_T \\propto 1/\\tau$.",

It presents a standard parameter extraction and uncertainty analysis task that is solvable using the provided information and established principles.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts: first, the derivation of a linear relationship between the small-signal conductance $g_d$ and the operating current $I_0$; second, the derivation of estimators for the reverse saturation current $I_S$ and the ideality factor $n$ from the parameters of this linear relationship; and third, the propagation of temperature uncertainty to the ideality factor estimate.\n\nThe analysis begins with the provided steady-state current-voltage ($I$-$V$) relationship for a forward-biased p-n diode:\n$$I = I_S\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{n V_T}\\right)-1\\right)$$\nwhere $I_S$ is the reverse saturation current, $n$ is the ideality factor, and $V_T$ is the thermal voltage, given by $V_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q}$. Here, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe small-signal (or differential) conductance, $g_d$, is defined as the derivative of the current $I$ with respect to the voltage $V$, evaluated at a specific DC operating point $(V_0, I_0)$.\n$$g_d = \\frac{dI}{dV} \\bigg|_{V=V_0}$$\nTo find this derivative, we differentiate the $I$-$V$ equation with respect to $V$:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dV} = \\frac{d}{dV} \\left[ I_S\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{n V_T}\\right)-1\\right) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dI}{dV} = I_S \\cdot \\frac{d}{dV}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{n V_T}\\right)\\right) - I_S \\cdot \\frac{d}{dV}(1)$$\nUsing the chain rule for the exponential term, we get:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dV} = I_S \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\frac{V}{n V_T}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{n V_T}$$\nEvaluating this at the operating point voltage $V_0$ gives the conductance $g_d$:\n$$g_d = \\frac{I_S}{n V_T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_0}{n V_T}\\right)$$\nThe goal is to express $g_d$ as a function of the operating current $I_0$. We can rearrange the original diode equation evaluated at the operating point to solve for the exponential term:\n$$I_0 = I_S\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{V_0}{n V_T}\\right)-1\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{I_0}{I_S} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_0}{n V_T}\\right)-1$$\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{V_0}{n V_T}\\right) = \\frac{I_0}{I_S} + 1 = \\frac{I_0 + I_S}{I_S}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for the exponential term back into our equation for $g_d$:\n$$g_d = \\frac{I_S}{n V_T} \\left( \\frac{I_0 + I_S}{I_S} \\right)$$\n$$g_d = \\frac{1}{n V_T} (I_0 + I_S)$$\nThis equation can be rearranged into the standard linear form $y = mx + b$, where $g_d$ is the dependent variable ($y$) and $I_0$ is the independent variable ($x$):\n$$g_d(I_0) = \\left(\\frac{1}{n V_T}\\right) I_0 + \\left(\\frac{I_S}{n V_T}\\right)$$\nThis is the desired linear relationship.\n\nFrom a set of measured pairs $(I_0, g_d)$, we can perform an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to find the slope, $m$, and the y-intercept, $b$. By comparing the empirical linear fit $g_d = m I_0 + b$ with the derived theoretical relationship, we can identify:\n- Slope: $m = \\frac{1}{n V_T}$\n- Intercept: $b = \\frac{I_S}{n V_T}$\n\nThese two equations can be inverted to solve for the unknown diode parameters $n$ and $I_S$.\nFrom the slope equation, we can isolate $n$:\n$$n = \\frac{1}{m V_T}$$\nTo find $I_S$, we can observe that the intercept $b$ is simply the slope $m$ multiplied by $I_S$ ($b = m \\cdot I_S$). Therefore:\n$$I_S = \\frac{b}{m}$$\nGiven the results of a linear regression ($m, b$) and the temperature $T$ (to calculate $V_T$), we can compute the estimates for the diode parameters, which we denote as $\\hat{n}$ and $\\hat{I}_S$:\n$$\\hat{n} = \\frac{1}{m V_T}$$\n$$\\hat{I}_S = \\frac{b}{m}$$\nwhere $V_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q}$ is calculated using the provided constants for $k_B$ and $q$.\n\nFinally, we must quantify the uncertainty in the ideality factor, $\\delta n_T$, that arises solely from a known uncertainty in the measurement of the absolute temperature, $\\Delta T$. We use the first-order uncertainty propagation formula. The expression for $n$ as a function of temperature $T$ is:\n$$n(T) = \\frac{1}{m V_T} = \\frac{1}{m \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{q}\\right)} = \\frac{q}{m k_B T}$$\nThe uncertainty $\\delta n_T$ for a small uncertainty $\\Delta T$ is approximated by:\n$$\\delta n_T \\approx \\left| \\frac{dn}{dT} \\right| \\Delta T$$\nWe compute the derivative of $n$ with respect to $T$, treating the regression parameter $m$ as a constant as per the problem statement:\n$$\\frac{dn}{dT} = \\frac{d}{dT} \\left( \\frac{q}{m k_B} T^{-1} \\right) = \\frac{q}{m k_B} (-1 \\cdot T^{-2}) = -\\frac{q}{m k_B T^2}$$\nThe magnitude of the uncertainty is then:\n$$\\delta n_T = \\left| -\\frac{q}{m k_B T^2} \\right| \\Delta T = \\frac{q}{m k_B T^2} \\Delta T$$\nThis expression can be simplified by substituting the expression for $n$ back into it. Since $n = \\frac{q}{m k_B T}$, we can write $\\frac{q}{m k_B} = nT$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\\frac{dn}{dT} = -\\frac{nT}{T^2} = -\\frac{n}{T}$$\nTherefore, the uncertainty contribution from temperature is:\n$$\\delta n_T = \\left| -\\frac{n}{T} \\right| \\Delta T = \\frac{n}{T} \\Delta T$$\nWhen performing the numerical calculation, we use the estimated value $\\hat{n}$:\n$$\\delta n_T = \\frac{\\hat{n}}{T} \\Delta T$$\nThis completes the derivation of all necessary formulas for the numerical tasks.",
