            "solution": "The problem statement is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of semiconductor physics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language. It represents a standard, fundamental problem in the study of p-n junctions.\n\nThe task is to derive the expressions for the minority carrier concentrations in the quasi-neutral regions of an abrupt p-n junction at thermal equilibrium and then to compute their numerical values for a specific case. The derivation must start from fundamental principles.\n\nThe two fundamental principles governing carrier concentrations in a semiconductor at thermal equilibrium are the mass-action law and the principle of local charge neutrality.\n\n1.  **Mass-Action Law**: For a non-degenerate semiconductor at thermal equilibrium, the product of the free electron concentration, $n$, and the free hole concentration, $p$, is a constant for a given temperature, $T$. This constant is the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i$.\n    $$np = n_i^2$$\n    This relationship holds true at every point within the semiconductor.\n\n2.  **Local Charge Neutrality**: In a uniformly doped semiconductor region far from any junction or surface (a quasi-neutral region), the net charge density, $\\rho$, is effectively zero. The total charge density is the sum of charges from mobile carriers (electrons and holes) and fixed ionized dopant atoms.\n    $$\\rho = q(p - n + N_D^+ - N_A^-) = 0$$\n    where $q$ is the elementary charge, $N_D^+$ is the concentration of ionized donor atoms, and $N_A^-$ is the concentration of ionized acceptor atoms. The assumption of complete ionization implies that $N_D^+ = N_D$ (the total donor concentration) and $N_A^- = N_A$ (the total acceptor concentration).\n\nWe apply these principles to the two quasi-neutral regions of the p-n junction.\n\n**Quasi-Neutral p-Side**\n\nIn the p-type region, which is doped with acceptors ($N_A$) and assumed to contain no donors ($N_D=0$), the carrier concentrations far from the junction are denoted $p_{p0}$ (majority holes) and $n_{p0}$ (minority electrons).\n\nThe charge neutrality condition is:\n$$p_{p0} - n_{p0} - N_A = 0 \\implies p_{p0} = N_A + n_{p0}$$\n\nThe mass-action law in this region is:\n$$n_{p0} p_{p0} = n_i^2$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{p0}$ from charge neutrality into the mass-action law gives:\n$$n_{p0} (N_A + n_{p0}) = n_i^2$$\n$$n_{p0}^2 + N_A n_{p0} - n_i^2 = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for the minority electron concentration $n_{p0}$. Solving for $n_{p0}$ (which must be a positive quantity):\n$$n_{p0} = \\frac{-N_A + \\sqrt{N_A^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-N_A + \\sqrt{N_A^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\n\nFor any practical doping level, the acceptor concentration is much greater than the intrinsic carrier concentration, i.e., $N_A \\gg n_i$. We can factor out $N_A$ from the square root:\n$$n_{p0} = \\frac{N_A}{2} \\left(-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{2n_i}{N_A}\\right)^2}\\right)$$\n\nUsing the Taylor expansion $\\sqrt{1+x} \\approx 1 + \\frac{x}{2}$ for small $x$, where $x = (2n_i/N_A)^2 \\ll 1$:\n$$n_{p0} \\approx \\frac{N_A}{2} \\left(-1 + \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2n_i}{N_A}\\right)^2\\right)\\right) = \\frac{N_A}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{4n_i^2}{N_A^2}\\right) = \\frac{N_A}{2} \\left(\\frac{2n_i^2}{N_A^2}\\right)$$\n$$n_{p0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the minority electron concentration in the p-side. This result is equivalent to making the initial valid approximation that the majority hole concentration is determined almost entirely by the doping, $p_{p0} \\approx N_A$, since $N_A \\gg n_i$.\n\n**Quasi-Neutral n-Side**\n\nSimilarly, in the n-type region, doped with donors ($N_D$) and with $N_A=0$, the concentrations far from the junction are $n_{n0}$ (majority electrons) and $p_{n0}$ (minority holes).\n\nThe charge neutrality condition is:\n$$p_{n0} - n_{n0} + N_D = 0 \\implies n_{n0} = N_D + p_{n0}$$\n\nThe mass-action law in this region is:\n$$n_{n0} p_{n0} = n_i^2$$\n\nSubstituting for $n_{n0}$:\n$$(N_D + p_{n0}) p_{n0} = n_i^2$$\n$$p_{n0}^2 + N_D p_{n0} - n_i^2 = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for the minority hole concentration $p_{n0}$. Following the same procedure as for the p-side, and using the practical condition that $N_D \\gg n_i$, we arrive at the corresponding expression for the minority hole concentration in the n-side:\n$$p_{n0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D}$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n$N_{A} = 10^{17}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$N_{D} = 10^{16}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$n_{i} = 10^{10}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$\n\nWe can now compute the numerical values for $n_{p0}$ and $p_{n0}$.\n\nFor the minority electron concentration in the p-side, $n_{p0}$:\n$$n_{p0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A} = \\frac{(10^{10}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3})^2}{10^{17}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}} = \\frac{10^{20}\\,\\text{cm}^{-6}}{10^{17}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}} = 10^3\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nFor the minority hole concentration in the n-side, $p_{n0}$:\n$$p_{n0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D} = \\frac{(10^{10}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3})^2}{10^{16}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}} = \\frac{10^{20}\\,\\text{cm}^{-6}}{10^{16}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}} = 10^4\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nThe problem requires the results to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$n_{p0} = 1000\\,\\text{cm}^{-3} = 1.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$p_{n0} = 10000\\,\\text{cm}^{-3} = 1.00 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(n_{p0}, p_{n0})$.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation, Calculation, and Explanation\n\nThe derivation begins with Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential $\\phi(x)$, which relates the second derivative of the potential to the local space charge density $\\rho(x)$ and the permittivity of the material $\\epsilon_s$ (for silicon).\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_s}\n$$\nThe electric field is defined as the negative gradient of the potential, $E(x) = -\\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx}$. Differentiating this expression with respect to $x$ yields a relationship between the electric field and the charge density:\n$$\n\\frac{dE(x)}{dx} = -\\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_s}\n$$\nUnder the depletion approximation, the space charge density $\\rho(x)$ within the depletion region is determined solely by the fixed, ionized dopant atoms. We assume that mobile holes and electrons are completely swept out of this region.\n- In the $p$-type depletion region ($-x_p  x  0$), the charge is due to negatively ionized acceptor atoms: $\\rho(x) = -qN_A$.\n- In the $n$-type depletion region ($0  x  x_n$), the charge is due to positively ionized donor atoms: $\\rho(x) = qN_D$.\n- Outside the depletion region ($x \\le -x_p$ and $x \\ge x_n$), the semiconductor is neutral, so $\\rho(x) = 0$.\n\nWe can now find the electric field by integrating $\\frac{dE}{dx}$ over the depletion region.\nFirst, for the $p$-side ($-x_p  x  0$):\n$$\n\\int_{E(-x_p)}^{E(x)} dE' = \\int_{-x_p}^{x} \\frac{-qN_A}{\\epsilon_s} dx'\n$$\nThe boundary condition at the edge of the depletion region is that the electric field must be zero, as the region beyond is charge-neutral. Thus, $E(-x_p) = 0$. The integration yields:\n$$\nE(x) = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}(x + x_p) \\quad \\text{for } -x_p  x  0\n$$\nNext, for the $n$-side ($0  x  x_n$):\n$$\n\\int_{E(x)}^{E(x_n)} dE' = \\int_{x}^{x_n} \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s} dx'\n$$\nThe boundary condition at this edge is $E(x_n) = 0$. The integration yields:\n$$\n0 - E(x) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}(x_n - x) \\implies E(x) = -\\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}(x_n - x) \\quad \\text{for } 0  x  x_n\n$$\nA fundamental condition is that the electric field must be continuous at the metallurgical junction ($x=0$), as there is no sheet of charge at this interface. Therefore, $E(0^-) = E(0^+)$.\nUsing the expression for the $p$-side at $x=0$:\n$$\nE(0^-) = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}(0 + x_p) = -\\frac{qN_A x_p}{\\epsilon_s}\n$$\nUsing the expression for the $n$-side at $x=0$:\n$$\nE(0^+) = -\\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}(x_n - 0) = -\\frac{qN_D x_n}{\\epsilon_s}\n$$\nEquating these two expressions for the electric field at $x=0$:\n$$\n-\\frac{qN_A x_p}{\\epsilon_s} = -\\frac{qN_D x_n}{\\epsilon_s}\n$$\nCanceling the common terms ($-q/\\epsilon_s$) gives the central relationship:\n$$\nN_A x_p = N_D x_n\n$$\nThis equation embodies the principle of charge neutrality for the depletion region as a whole. The total negative charge per unit area on the $p$-side, $-qN_A x_p$, must be equal in magnitude to the total positive charge per unit area on the $n$-side, $qN_D x_n$.\n\nTo find the desired ratio, we simply rearrange this equation:\n$$\n\\frac{x_p}{x_n} = \\frac{N_D}{N_A}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the ratio of the depletion widths.\n\nNow, we evaluate this ratio numerically using the given dopant concentrations: $N_A = 10^{17}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$ and $N_D = 10^{16}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$.\n$$\n\\frac{x_p}{x_n} = \\frac{10^{16}}{10^{17}} = 10^{16-17} = 10^{-1} = 0.1\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures, which is $0.100$.\n\nThe physical meaning of the ratio $x_p/x_n = N_D/N_A$ is a direct consequence of the charge neutrality requirement in the space charge region. For the junction to be in equilibrium, the total amount of exposed negative charge (ionized acceptors) on the $p$-side must exactly balance the total amount of exposed positive charge (ionized donors) on the $n$-side. Since the charge density is uniform on each side ($N_A$ and $N_D$), the product of the charge density and the width of the region must be equal for both sides, i.e., $N_A x_p = N_D x_n$. This implies that the depletion region must extend farther into the more lightly doped side to uncover the same amount of charge as is uncovered over a shorter distance in the more heavily doped side. In this problem, the $n$-side is more lightly doped ($N_D  N_A$), so the depletion width is greater on the $n$-side ($x_n > x_p$). Specifically, the depletion region extends $10$ times farther into the $n$-side than into the $p$-side.\n\nIn the context of the equilibrium band diagram, the built-in potential, $V_{bi}$, corresponds to the total energy band bending across the junction. This potential drop is partitioned between the $p$-side ($\\Delta V_p$) and the $n$-side ($\\Delta V_n$). The amount of band bending on each side is proportional to the area under its respective electric field triangle, which in turn is proportional to its depletion width. The ratio of the potential drops across each part of the depletion region is $\\Delta V_p / \\Delta V_n = x_p / x_n = N_D / N_A$. Therefore, a larger portion of the total band bending occurs across the more lightly doped side. Visually, the energy bands bend more gradually over the wider depletion region on the lightly doped side and more steeply over the narrower depletion region on the heavily doped side.",

Using $x_n = W \\frac{N_A}{N_A+N_D}$:\n$$\nQ_j(V_R) = qN_D W(V_R) \\frac{N_A}{N_A+N_D} = q \\frac{N_A N_D}{N_A+N_D} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_s (V_{bi} + V_R)}{q} \\frac{N_A+N_D}{N_A N_D}}\n$$\n$$\nQ_j(V_R) = \\sqrt{2q\\varepsilon_s \\frac{N_A N_D}{N_A+N_D} (V_{bi} + V_R)}\n$$\nThe capacitance per unit area is $C_j = \\frac{dQ_j}{dV_R}$:\n$$\nC_j(V_R) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(2q\\varepsilon_s \\frac{N_A N_D}{N_A+N_D} (V_{bi} + V_R)\\right)^{-1/2} \\left(2q\\varepsilon_s \\frac{N_A N_D}{N_A+N_D}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{q\\varepsilon_s}{2(V_{bi}+V_R)} \\frac{N_A N_D}{N_A+N_D}}\n$$\nAt zero bias, $V_R=0$, so the capacitance per unit area $C_j(0)$ is:\n$$\nC_j(0) = \\sqrt{\\frac{q\\varepsilon_s}{2V_{bi}} \\frac{N_A N_D}{N_A+N_D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{q\\varepsilon_s}{2V_{bi}} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)^{-1}}\n$$\n\nTo verify if $C_j(0) = \\varepsilon_s/W_0$, we can rearrange the expression for $W_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{W_0} = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_s V_{bi}}{q} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)}\\right)^{-1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{q}{2\\varepsilon_s V_{bi}} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)^{-1}}\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\varepsilon_s$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\varepsilon_s}{W_0} = \\varepsilon_s \\sqrt{\\frac{q}{2\\varepsilon_s V_{bi}} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)^{-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_s^2 q}{2\\varepsilon_s V_{bi}} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)^{-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{q\\varepsilon_s}{2V_{bi}} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)^{-1}}\n$$\nThis is identical to the expression for $C_j(0)$, thus verifying the relation $C_j(0) = \\varepsilon_s/W_0$. This result shows that the $p$-$n$ junction capacitor behaves like a parallel-plate capacitor with plate separation $W_0$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $C_j(0)$ numerically.
