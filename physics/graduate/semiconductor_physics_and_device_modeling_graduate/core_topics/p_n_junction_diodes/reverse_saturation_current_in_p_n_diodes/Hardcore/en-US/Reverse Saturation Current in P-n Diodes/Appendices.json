            "introduction": "The reverse saturation current ($I_s$) is a key parameter in the ideal diode model, representing the diffusion-driven leakage current under reverse bias. This exercise reinforces the derivation of $I_s$ from minority carrier diffusion principles and quantitatively explores its strong dependence on the doping concentrations of the p-n junction. By calculating how $I_s$ changes with the acceptor concentration, you will gain a concrete understanding of how asymmetric doping can be used to engineer a diode's leakage characteristics .",

The assumptions (depletion approximation, low-level injection, negligible field in quasi-neutral regions) are part of the standard derivation of the ideal diode equation. The provided numerical values for material parameters and doping concentrations are physically realistic for a silicon device. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided, and is mathematically well-posed, leading to a unique solution. There are no scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict\nThe problem is **valid**. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Reverse Saturation Current $I_s$\nThe total current in a $p$-$n$ diode is the sum of the minority carrier diffusion currents injected across the depletion region. The reverse saturation current, $I_s$, represents this flow under a large reverse bias. We derive the contributions from the $p$-side and $n$-side separately. Let the metallurgical junction be at $x=0$, with the $p$-region at $x<0$ and the $n$-region at $x>0$. The edges of the depletion region are at $x=-x_p$ and $x=x_n$.\n\n**1. Hole Diffusion Current from the $n$-side ($I_p$)**\n\nIn the quasi-neutral $n$-region ($x > x_n$), the minority carriers are holes. Under the assumption of negligible electric field, the hole current is purely diffusive:\n$$J_p(x) = -q D_p \\frac{dp_n(x)}{dx}$$\nThe steady-state continuity equation for holes is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial p_n}{\\partial t} = 0 = -\\frac{1}{q} \\frac{dJ_p}{dx} - \\frac{p_n(x) - p_{n0}}{\\tau_p}$$\nwhere $p_n(x)$ is the hole concentration, $p_{n0}$ is the equilibrium hole concentration, and $\\tau_p$ is the hole lifetime. Substituting the expression for $J_p(x)$ into the continuity equation gives the minority carrier diffusion equation for the excess hole concentration $\\delta p_n(x) = p_n(x) - p_{n0}$:\n$$\\frac{d^2(\\delta p_n(x))}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta p_n(x)}{D_p \\tau_p} = 0$$\nUsing the definition of the hole diffusion length, $L_p = \\sqrt{D_p \\tau_p}$, this becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^2(\\delta p_n)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta p_n}{L_p^2} = 0$$\nWe define a new coordinate $x' = x - x_n$ for the quasi-neutral $n$-region ($x' \\geq 0$). The general solution is $\\delta p_n(x') = C_1 \\exp(-x'/L_p) + C_2 \\exp(x'/L_p)$.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1. Far from the junction ($x' \\to \\infty$), the excess concentration decays to zero: $\\delta p_n(\\infty) = 0$, which implies $C_2 = 0$.\n2. At the depletion edge ($x' = 0$), the law of the junction applies: $p_n(x_n) = p_{n0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right)$, where $V_a$ is the applied voltage. Thus, $\\delta p_n(0) = p_n(x_n) - p_{n0} = p_{n0}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$.\n\nFrom the boundary conditions, $C_1 = p_{n0}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$. The excess hole profile is:\n$$\\delta p_n(x') = p_{n0}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x'}{L_p}\\right)$$\nThe hole current density at the depletion edge ($x' = 0$) is:\n$$J_p(x_n) = -q D_p \\left. \\frac{d p_n(x')}{dx'} \\right|_{x'=0} = -q D_p \\left. \\frac{d \\delta p_n(x')}{dx'} \\right|_{x'=0}$$\n$$J_p(x_n) = -q D_p \\left[ p_{n0}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right) \\left(-\\frac{1}{L_p}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{q D_p}{L_p} p_{n0} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$$\nUnder the assumption of nondegenerate carriers, the mass-action law gives $p_{n0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D}$. Thus:\n$$J_p(x_n) = \\frac{q D_p n_i^2}{L_p N_D} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$$\n\n**2. Electron Diffusion Current from the $p$-side ($I_n$)**\n\nBy symmetry, we analyze the minority electrons in the quasi-neutral $p$-region ($x < -x_p$). The diffusion equation for the excess electron concentration $\\delta n_p(x) = n_p(x) - n_{p0}$ is:\n$$\\frac{d^2(\\delta n_p)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta n_p}{L_n^2} = 0$$\nwhere $L_n = \\sqrt{D_n \\tau_n}$. The solution, satisfying the boundary condition $\\delta n_p(-\\infty)=0$, is found using the coordinate $x'' = x+x_p \\le 0$. The minority electron current density at the depletion edge $x=-x_p$ is:\n$$J_n(-x_p) = q D_n \\left. \\frac{d n_p(x'')}{dx''} \\right|_{x''=0} = \\frac{q D_n}{L_n} n_{p0} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$$\nUsing the mass-action law $n_{p0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A}$:\n$$J_n(-x_p) = \\frac{q D_n n_i^2}{L_n N_A} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$$\n\n**3. Total Current and Reverse Saturation Current**\n\nThe total current density $J$ is the sum of the electron and hole diffusion currents, which are constant across the depletion region:\n$$J = J_p(x_n) + J_n(-x_p) = q n_i^2 \\left(\\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} + \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_A}\\right) \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$$\nThis is the ideal diode equation, $J = J_s \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$. The reverse saturation current, $I_s = A J_s$, where $A$ is the junction area, is therefore:\n$$I_s = A q n_i^2 \\left(\\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} + \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_A}\\right)$$\nThis is the required expression.\n\n### Calculation of the Factor $F$\nThe factor $F$ is the ratio of the reverse saturation current at $N_{A1} = 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ to that at $N_{A2} = 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.\n$$F = \\frac{I_s(N_A = N_{A1})}{I_s(N_A = N_{A2})} = \\frac{A q n_i^2 \\left(\\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} + \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_{A1}}\\right)}{A q n_i^2 \\left(\\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} + \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_{A2}}\\right)}$$\nThe common factor $A q n_i^2$ cancels out:\n$$F = \\frac{\\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} + \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_{A1}}}{\\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} + \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_{A2}}}$$\nWe can simplify the terms $\\frac{D}{L}$ using $L = \\sqrt{D\\tau}$:\n$$\\frac{D_p}{L_p} = \\frac{D_p}{\\sqrt{D_p \\tau_p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_p}{\\tau_p}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{D_n}{L_n} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_n}{\\tau_n}}$$\nSubstitute the given numerical values:\n- $N_D = 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n- $N_{A1} = 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n- $N_{A2} = 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n- $\\frac{D_p}{\\tau_p} = \\frac{12\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 12 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s^2}$\n- $\\frac{D_n}{\\tau_n} = \\frac{35\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 35 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s^2}$\n\nNow, we compute the two terms in the numerator and denominator:\nTerm from $n$-side: $\\frac{\\sqrt{D_p/\\tau_p}}{N_D} = \\frac{\\sqrt{12 \\times 10^6}}{10^{16}} = \\sqrt{12} \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{cm^4/s}$\nTerm from $p$-side for $N_{A1}$: $\\frac{\\sqrt{D_n/\\tau_n}}{N_{A1}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{35 \\times 10^6}}{10^{15}} = \\sqrt{35} \\times 10^{-12} = 10\\sqrt{35} \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{cm^4/s}$\nTerm from $p$-side for $N_{A2}$: $\\frac{\\sqrt{D_n/\\tau_n}}{N_{A2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{35 \\times 10^6}}{10^{18}} = \\sqrt{35} \\times 10^{-15} = 0.01\\sqrt{35} \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{cm^4/s}$\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{\\sqrt{12} \\times 10^{-13} + 10\\sqrt{35} \\times 10^{-13}}{\\sqrt{12} \\times 10^{-13} + 0.01\\sqrt{35} \\times 10^{-13}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{12} + 10\\sqrt{35}}{\\sqrt{12} + 0.01\\sqrt{35}}$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically:\n$\\sqrt{12} \\approx 3.46410$\n$\\sqrt{35} \\approx 5.91608$\n$$F \\approx \\frac{3.46410 + 10 \\times 5.91608}{3.46410 + 0.01 \\times 5.91608} = \\frac{3.46410 + 59.1608}{3.46410 + 0.0591608} = \\frac{62.6249}{3.52326} \\approx 17.7746$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives $17.8$.",

            "introduction": "In practical semiconductor fabrication, it is common to have both donor and acceptor impurities present simultaneously in a region, a situation known as compensation. This practice investigates how such compensated doping alters the calculation of the reverse saturation current compared to a simple, uncompensated junction.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in semiconductor physics, well-posed, and all necessary parameters and assumptions for a unique solution are provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the ratio $R = I_{s}^{(\\mathrm{comp})} / I_{s}^{(\\mathrm{no\\;comp})}$, where $I_{s}^{(\\mathrm{comp})}$ is the reverse saturation current of a p-n junction diode with compensated doping, and $I_{s}^{(\\mathrm{no\\;comp})}$ is the current for an equivalent diode without compensation.\n\nThe reverse saturation current, $I_{s}$, for a one-dimensional, long-base diode (where the quasi-neutral region widths are much larger than the minority carrier diffusion lengths) is given by the sum of the electron diffusion current at the edge of the p-side depletion region and the hole diffusion current at the edge of the n-side depletion region. The formula is:\n$$I_{s} = qA \\left( \\frac{D_{n}}{L_{n}} n_{p0} + \\frac{D_{p}}{L_{p}} p_{n0} \\right)$$\nHere, $q$ is the elementary charge, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, $D_{n}$ and $D_{p}$ are the diffusion coefficients for electrons and holes, respectively. $L_{n}$ and $L_{p}$ are the diffusion lengths, and $n_{p0}$ and $p_{n0}$ are the equilibrium minority carrier concentrations. The diffusion length, $L$, is related to the diffusion coefficient, $D$, and the minority carrier lifetime, $\\tau$, by $L = \\sqrt{D\\tau}$. Therefore, the term $D/L$ can be expressed as $D/\\sqrt{D\\tau} = \\sqrt{D/\\tau}$.\n\nThe equilibrium minority-carrier concentrations are determined by the mass-action law, $p_{0}n_{0} = n_{i}^{2}$, where $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration. In an extrinsic semiconductor, the minority carrier concentration is $n_{i}^{2}$ divided by the majority carrier concentration. The majority carrier concentration is, in turn, determined by the net effective doping concentration, assuming complete ionization and that the net doping concentration is much larger than $n_{i}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the compensated diode.\nIn the $p$-type region, there are acceptor atoms with concentration $N_{A}$ and compensating donor atoms with concentration $N_{D}'$. Under the assumption of complete ionization, the charge neutrality condition in the quasi-neutral $p$-region is $p_{p0} + N_{D}' = n_{p0} + N_{A}$. Since the region is $p$-type, the majority carrier (hole) concentration $p_{p0}$ is much larger than the minority carrier (electron) concentration $n_{p0}$ ($p_{p0} \\gg n_{p0}$). The neutrality condition simplifies to $p_{p0} \\approx N_{A} - N_{D}'$. This is the effective majority carrier concentration.\nThe minority carrier concentration in the $p$-region is then given by the mass-action law:\n$$n_{p0}^{(\\mathrm{comp})} = \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{p_{p0}} \\approx \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{A} - N_{D}'}$$\nIn the $n$-type region, there are donor atoms with concentration $N_{D}$ and compensating acceptor atoms with concentration $N_{A}'$. The charge neutrality condition is $n_{n0} + N_{A}' = p_{n0} + N_{D}$. For an $n$-type region, $n_{n0} \\gg p_{n0}$, so the condition simplifies to $n_{n0} \\approx N_{D} - N_{A}'$.\nThe minority carrier concentration in the $n$-region is:\n$$p_{n0}^{(\\mathrm{comp})} = \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{n_{n0}} \\approx \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{D} - N_{A}'}$$\nThe reverse saturation current for the compensated diode is therefore:\n$$I_{s}^{(\\mathrm{comp})} = qA n_{i}^{2} \\left( \\frac{D_{n}}{L_{n}(N_{A} - N_{D}')} + \\frac{D_{p}}{L_{p}(N_{D} - N_{A}')} \\right)$$\n\nNext, we analyze the hypothetical uncompensated diode.\nIn this case, the compensating dopants are absent, so $N_{D}' = 0$ and $N_{A}' = 0$. The diode is \"otherwise identical,\" which implies that the parameters $N_{A}$, $N_{D}$, $D_{n}$, $\\tau_{n}$, $D_{p}$, $\\tau_{p}$, $A$, $q$, and $n_{i}$ are unchanged.\nThe majority carrier concentration in the $p$-region is $p_{p0} \\approx N_{A}$.\nThe minority carrier concentration in the $p$-region is:\n$$n_{p0}^{(\\mathrm{no\\;comp})} = \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{A}}$$\nThe majority carrier concentration in the $n$-region is $n_{n0} \\approx N_{D}$.\nThe minority carrier concentration in the $n$-region is:\n$$p_{n0}^{(\\mathrm{no\\;comp})} = \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{D}}$$\nThe reverse saturation current for the uncompensated diode is:\n$$I_{s}^{(\\mathrm{no\\;comp})} = qA n_{i}^{2} \\left( \\frac{D_{n}}{L_{n}N_{A}} + \\frac{D_{p}}{L_{p}N_{D}} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we compute the ratio $R$.\n$$R = \\frac{I_{s}^{(\\mathrm{comp})}}{I_{s}^{(\\mathrm{no\\;comp})}} = \\frac{qA n_{i}^{2} \\left( \\frac{D_{n}}{L_{n}(N_{A} - N_{D}')} + \\frac{D_{p}}{L_{p}(N_{D} - N_{A}')} \\right)}{qA n_{i}^{2} \\left( \\frac{D_{n}}{L_{n}N_{A}} + \\frac{D_{p}}{L_{p}N_{D}} \\right)}$$\nThe common factor $qA n_{i}^{2}$ cancels. Also, since $L_{n} = \\sqrt{D_{n}\\tau_{n}}$ and $L_{p} = \\sqrt{D_{p}\\tau_{p}}$, the terms $D_{n}/L_{n}$ and $D_{p}/L_{p}$ can be written as $\\sqrt{D_{n}/\\tau_{n}}$ and $\\sqrt{D_{p}/\\tau_{p}}$.

A lower net doping concentration leads to a higher equilibrium minority carrier concentration ($n_{p0} \\propto 1/N_{A,eff}$, $p_{n0} \\propto 1/N_{D,eff}$).

            "introduction": "While doping concentrations provide the most direct engineering control over reverse saturation current, the value of $I_s$ is ultimately rooted in the fundamental properties of the semiconductor material itself. This advanced exercise connects the macroscopic device parameter $I_s$ to the microscopic physics of the material's electronic band structure. You will trace the origin of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i$, back to the effective densities of states, $N_c$ and $N_v$, which are themselves functions of the carrier effective masses. By deriving a scaling law for how $I_s$ changes with effective mass , you will develop a deeper appreciation for how the quantum mechanical properties of a material directly influence the performance of a classical device.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a scaling law for the reverse saturation current $I_s$ of a $p^{+}\\text{-}n$ diode when the density-of-states effective masses for electrons, $m_{e}^{\\ast}$, and holes, $m_{h}^{\\ast}$, are altered. The derivation must proceed from first principles.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between carrier concentrations and the effective densities of states in the conduction band, $N_c$, and valence band, $N_v$. The electron concentration $n$ is given by the integral of the density of states in the conduction band, $g_c(E)$, multiplied by the Fermi-Dirac occupation probability, $f(E)$, over all available energy states in the band:\n$$n = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} g_c(E) f(E) \\, dE$$\nwhere $E_c$ is the conduction band minimum.\n\nUnder the parabolic-band approximation, the density of states is given by:\n$$g_c(E) = \\frac{4\\pi (2m_{e}^{\\ast})^{3/2}}{h^3} \\sqrt{E - E_c}$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant. The problem statement uses a single symbol $m_e^*$ for the density-of-states effective mass, which incorporates effects like valley degeneracy.\n\nFor a nondegenerate semiconductor, the Fermi level $E_F$ is several $k_B T$ away from the band edges, allowing the Fermi-Dirac distribution to be approximated by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:\n$$f(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)} \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nSubstituting the approximations for $g_c(E)$ and $f(E)$ into the integral for $n$:\n$$n = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} \\frac{4\\pi (2m_{e}^{\\ast})^{3/2}}{h^3} \\sqrt{E - E_c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\, dE$$\nThis integral can be evaluated by setting $x = (E - E_c) / (k_B T)$, which gives $dE = k_B T \\, dx$.\n$$n = \\frac{4\\pi (2m_{e}^{\\ast})^{3/2}}{h^3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (k_B T x)^{1/2} \\exp(-x) \\, k_B T \\, dx$$\n$$n = \\frac{4\\pi (2m_{e}^{\\ast} k_B T)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{1/2} \\exp(-x) \\, dx$$\nThe integral is the Gamma function $\\Gamma(3/2) = \\sqrt{\\pi}/2$.\n$$n = \\frac{4\\pi (2m_{e}^{\\ast} k_B T)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_{e}^{\\ast} k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis defines the effective density of states in the conduction band, $N_c$:\n$$N_c = 2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_{e}^{\\ast} k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nsuch that $n = N_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$. We see that $N_c \\propto (m_{e}^{\\ast})^{3/2}$.\n\nA similar derivation for the hole concentration $p$ yields:\n$$p = N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_v}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $E_v$ is the valence band maximum and $N_v$ is the effective density of states in the valence band:\n$$N_v = 2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_{h}^{\\ast} k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nwhich shows that $N_v \\propto (m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/2}$.\n\nThe law of mass action in thermal equilibrium states that the product $np$ is a constant for a given material at a fixed temperature, independent of doping. This product is equal to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i^2$:\n$$n_i^2 = np = \\left[N_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\\right] \\left[N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_v}{k_B T}\\right)\\right]$$\n$$n_i^2 = N_c N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_v}{k_B T}\\right) = N_c N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $E_g = E_c - E_v$ is the bandgap energy.\n\nNow, we relate $n_i^2$ to the reverse saturation current $I_s$. For a long-base, abrupt $p^{+}\\text{-}n$ diode, the reverse saturation current is dominated by the diffusion of minority carriers (holes) from the $n$-side. The electron injection from the heavily doped $p^{+}$-side is negligible. Thus, $I_s$ is approximately the hole diffusion current component:\n$$I_s \\approx q A \\frac{D_p}{L_p} p_{n0}$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $A$ is the diode cross-sectional area, $D_p$ is the hole diffusion coefficient, $L_p$ is the hole diffusion length, and $p_{n0}$ is the equilibrium concentration of minority holes in the $n$-type region.\n\nIn the $n$-type quasi-neutral region, the equilibrium majority carrier concentration is $n_{n0} \\approx N_d$, the donor concentration. Using the law of mass action, we find $p_{n0}$:\n$$p_{n0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{n_{n0}} \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_d}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $I_s$:\n$$I_s \\approx q A \\frac{D_p}{L_p N_d} n_i^2$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $n_i^2$:\n$$I_s \\approx \\left(q A \\frac{D_p}{L_p N_d}\\right) \\left[N_c N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)\\right]$$\nFinally, we substitute the dependencies of $N_c$ and $N_v$ on the effective masses:\n$$I_s \\propto N_c N_v \\propto (m_{e}^{\\ast})^{3/2} (m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/2} = (m_{e}^{\\ast} m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/2}$$\nThe problem states that $E_g$, $T$, doping concentrations ($N_d$), and all transport properties determining $D_p$ and $L_p$ are unchanged. The other terms ($q$, $A$, $k_B$, $h$) are fundamental constants. Therefore, the entire prefactor multiplying $(m_{e}^{\\ast} m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/2}$ is a constant.\n\nLet the initial current and effective masses be $I_s$, $m_{e}^{\\ast}$, and $m_{h}^{\\ast}$. The perturbed current and masses are $I_s'$, $m_{e}^{\\ast'} = \\alpha m_{e}^{\\ast}$, and $m_{h}^{\\ast'} = \\beta m_{h}^{\\ast}$. We can write the relationship as:\n$$I_s = K (m_{e}^{\\ast} m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/2}$$\n$$I_s' = K (m_{e}^{\\ast'} m_{h}^{\\ast'})^{3/2}$$\nwhere $K$ is the constant of proportionality.\n\nThe scaling law for the ratio $I_s'/I_s$ is then:\n$$\\frac{I_s'}{I_s} = \\frac{K (m_{e}^{\\ast'} m_{h}^{\\ast'})^{3/2}}{K (m_{e}^{\\ast} m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/2}} = \\left(\\frac{m_{e}^{\\ast'} m_{h}^{\\ast'}}{m_{e}^{\\ast} m_{h}^{\\ast}}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nSubstituting the scaling factors $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$\\frac{I_s'}{I_s} = \\left(\\frac{(\\alpha m_{e}^{\\ast}) (\\beta m_{h}^{\\ast})}{m_{e}^{\\ast} m_{h}^{\\ast}}\\right)^{3/2} = (\\alpha \\beta)^{3/2}$$\nThis is the desired explicit scaling law.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given values $\\alpha = 1.30$ and $\\beta = 0.90$.\n$$\\frac{I_s'}{I_s} = (1.30 \\times 0.90)^{3/2} = (1.17)^{3/2}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$(1.17)^{1.5} = 1.26554817...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.266$.",
