It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution involves three main parts as requested: enumerating the distinct directions, constructing their corresponding unit vectors, and verifying their normalization. The final goal is to determine the total number of such directions, $N$.\n\nA direction family $\\langle hkl \\rangle$ in a cubic system is the set of all directions that are crystallographically equivalent to $[hkl]$ by the symmetry operations of the cubic group. This is generated by permuting the indices $h, k, l$ and applying all possible combinations of positive and negative signs. The problem starts with the prototype direction $[110]$.\n\n**1. Enumeration of Distinct Directions**\n\nThe set of indices to be permuted are $\\{1, 1, 0\\}$.\nFirst, we find all unique permutations of these three indices:\n- $(1, 1, 0)$\n- $(1, 0, 1)$\n- $(0, 1, 1)$\n\nNext, for each of these permutations, we apply all possible independent sign changes to the non-zero indices. An index of $0$ has no sign.\n\n**For the permutation $(1, 1, 0)$:**\nThe non-zero indices are the first and second. We can have $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0)$. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ combinations:\n- $[110]$\n- $[1\\bar{1}0]$ (where $\\bar{1}$ denotes $-1$)\n- $[\\bar{1}10]$\n- $[\\bar{1}\\bar{1}0]$\n\n**For the permutation $(1, 0, 1)$:**\nThe non-zero indices are the first and third. We can have $(\\pm 1, 0, \\pm 1)$. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ combinations:\n- $[101]$\n- $[10\\bar{1}]$\n- $[\\bar{1}01]$\n- $[\\bar{1}0\\bar{1}]$\n\n**For the permutation $(0, 1, 1)$:**\nThe non-zero indices are the second and third. We can have $(0, \\pm 1, \\pm 1)$. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ combinations:\n- $[011]$\n- $[01\\bar{1}]$\n- $[0\\bar{1}1]$\n- $[0\\bar{1}\\bar{1}]$\n\nAll directions generated are unique. For example, $[110]$ cannot be transformed into $[101]$ simply by a sign change. The problem statement requires that opposite directions (e.g., $[110]$ and $[\\bar{1}\\bar{1}0]$) are counted as distinct, which we have done in our enumeration.\n\nSumming the number of directions from each permutation group: $N = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12$.\nThere are a total of $12$ distinct directions in the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ family.\n\n**2. Construction of Unit Vectors**\n\nA crystallographic direction $[hkl]$ corresponds to a real-space vector $\\mathbf{r} = h\\,\\mathbf{a}_{1} + k\\,\\mathbf{a}_{2} + l\\,\\mathbf{a}_{3}$.\nUsing the given primitive vectors for the simple cubic lattice, $\\mathbf{a}_{1} = a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\mathbf{a}_{2} = a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, and $\\mathbf{a}_{3} = a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, the vector is:\n$$ \\mathbf{r} = h(a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) + k(a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) + l(a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = a(h\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + l\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) $$\nThe magnitude of this vector is $|\\mathbf{r}| = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}$. Given that the Cartesian basis vectors are orthonormal ($\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = 1$, $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = 0$, etc.), the magnitude is:\n$$ |\\mathbf{r}| = \\sqrt{a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)} = a\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2} $$\nThe unit vector, $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$, in the direction $[hkl]$ is obtained by normalizing $\\mathbf{r}$:\n$$ \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[hkl]} = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{|\\mathbf{r}|} = \\frac{a(h\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + l\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})}{a\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} = \\frac{h\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + l\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} $$\nFor any direction in the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ family, the indices $(h, k, l)$ are a permutation of $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0)$. For all such directions, the sum of squares of the indices is:\n$$ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = (\\pm 1)^2 + (\\pm 1)^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 $$\nTherefore, the normalization factor for all unit vectors in this family is $1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe $12$ unit vectors are:\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[110]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[1\\bar{1}0]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[\\bar{1}10]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[\\bar{1}\\bar{1}0]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[101]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[10\\bar{1}]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[\\bar{1}01]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[\\bar{1}0\\bar{1}]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[011]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[01\\bar{1}]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[0\\bar{1}1]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[0\\bar{1}\\bar{1}]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n\n**3. Verification of Normalization**\n\nWe must verify that these are indeed unit vectors, i.e., that their magnitude is $1$. Let us take a generic unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[hkl]}$ from the list above, which has the general form $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(h\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + l\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$, where $\\{|h|,|k|,|l|\\}$ is a permutation of $\\{1,1,0\\}$.\nThe squared magnitude is $|\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}|^2 = \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$.\n$$ |\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}|^2 = \\left( \\frac{h\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + l\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{h\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + l\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) $$\n$$ |\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (h^2(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) + k^2(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) + l^2(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) + \\text{cross terms}) $$\nSince the basis vectors are orthonormal, all cross terms like $hk(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$ are zero, and the dot products of a vector with itself, such as $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, are equal to $1$.\n$$ |\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) $$\nAs established earlier, for any direction in the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ family, the sum of the squares of the indices is $h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 2$.\n$$ |\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (2) = 1 $$\nThe magnitude is $|\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}| = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. The normalization is therefore verified for all $12$ directions.\n\n**4. Final Reported Quantity**\n\nThe problem asks for $N$, the total number of distinct directions in the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ family. Based on the systematic enumeration, this number is $12$.",

Since $\\boldsymbol{G} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\boldsymbol{d}$, the vector $\\boldsymbol{G}$ is parallel to the vector $\\boldsymbol{d}$. This means that the crystallographic direction $[h \\, k \\, l]$ is perpendicular to the crystallographic plane $(h \\, k \\, l)$. This is a special property of cubic lattices and is not true for other crystal systems (e.g., hexagonal or tetragonal).\nTherefore, the angle between two planes $(h_1 \\, k_1 \\, l_1)$ and $(h_2 \\, k_2 \\, l_2)$ is identical to the angle between their normal directions, which are $[h_1 \\, k_1 \\, l_1]$ and $[h_2 \\, k_2 \\, l_2]$, respectively.\n\nFor wafer orientation in silicon (which has a diamond cubic structure, a special case of the face-centered cubic Bravais lattice), this geometric relationship is fundamental. Silicon wafers are commonly produced with a surface orientation of $(1 \\, 0 \\, 0)$ or $(1 \\, 1 \\, 1)$. The angle between these principal planes, $\\theta = \\arccos(1/\\sqrt{3})$, dictates the geometry for device fabrication. For example, anisotropic chemical etching, which proceeds at different rates along different crystallographic directions, can be used to create V-shaped grooves or other microstructures on a $(1 \\, 0 \\, 0)$ wafer, where the sloped walls of the groove are $(1 \\, 1 \\, 1)$ planes.

The etched pit will therefore be bounded by facets belonging to this family.\n\nThe wafer surface is oriented along the $(100)$ plane. For a cubic crystal system, the crystallographic axes are orthogonal. Let the normal to the wafer surface be the vector $\\vec{n}_{100} = [100]$. The directions lying within this plane must be orthogonal to its normal vector. A direction vector $\\vec{d} = [uvw]$ is in the $(100)$ plane if its dot product with $\\vec{n}_{100}$ is zero:\n$$ \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{n}_{100} = [uvw] \\cdot [100] = u \\cdot 1 + v \\cdot 0 + w \\cdot 0 = u = 0 $$\nSo, any direction in the $(100)$ plane must be of the form $[0vw]$.\n\nThe mask edges are aligned with the \"in-plane $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ directions\". This refers to the directions within the $(100)$ plane that are crystallographically equivalent to the $[110]$ direction. The family of $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ directions consists of all permutations of $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0)$. The directions from this family that lie in the $(100)$ plane are those with their first index being $0$. These are the directions $[011], [01\\bar{1}], [0\\bar{1}1],$ and $[0\\bar{1}\\bar{1}]$. These directions form two orthogonal pairs. For instance, $[011]$ and $[01\\bar{1}]$ are orthogonal because their dot product is $0$:\n$$ [011] \\cdot [01\\bar{1}] = (0)(0) + (1)(1) + (1)(-1) = 0 $$\nThus, a square mask can be aligned with its edges parallel to the $[011]$ and $[01\\bar{1}]$ directions on the $(100)$ surface.\n\nThe etched pit is bounded by $\\{111\\}$ planes. The intersection of these planes with the $(100)$ surface must align with the edges of the mask. The direction vector $\\vec{L}$ of the line of intersection between two planes with normals $\\vec{n}_a$ and $\\vec{n}_b$ is given by their cross product, $\\vec{L} = \\vec{n}_a \\times \\vec{n}_b$.\n\nLet's find the intersection of a $(111)$ plane with the $(100)$ surface:\n$$ \\vec{L} = \\vec{n}_{100} \\times \\vec{n}_{111} = [100] \\times [111] = [0, -1, 1] \\equiv [0\\bar{1}1] $$\nThis direction is parallel to the $[01\\bar{1}]$ direction.\nLet's find the intersection of a $(1\\bar{1}1)$ plane with the $(100)$ surface:\n$$ \\vec{L} = \\vec{n}_{100} \\times \\vec{n}_{1\\bar{1}1} = [100] \\times [1\\bar{1}1] = [0, -1, -1] \\equiv [0\\bar{1}\\bar{1}] $$\nThis direction is parallel to the $[011]$ direction.\n\nSince the mask edges are aligned with the natural intersection lines of the $\\{111\\}$ planes with the surface, the etching process will form a pit with a precise, symmetric geometry. The final shape will be an inverted pyramid. The base of this pyramid is the square mask opening on the $(100)$ surface, and its four sloped side walls are the four $\\{111\\}$-type planes that intersect along these lines, for instance, $(111)$, $(1\\bar{1}1)$, $(11\\bar{1})$, and $(1\\bar{1}\\bar{1})$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Dihedral Angle**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the dihedral angle between the $(100)$ wafer surface and any of the revealed $(111)$ sidewall facets. Due to the symmetry of the cubic crystal, this angle is the same for any choice of a $\\{111\\}$ plane. The dihedral angle between two planes is equal to the angle between their normal vectors.\n\nFor a cubic crystal, the normal vector to a plane $(hkl)$ is the direction vector $[hkl]$.\nThe normal vector to the wafer surface, the $(100)$ plane, is $\\vec{n}_1 = [100]$.\nThe normal vector to one of the sidewall facets, the $(111)$ plane, is $\\vec{n}_2 = [111]$.\n\nThe angle $\\theta$ between these two vectors can be found using the dot product formula:\n$$ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vec{n}_1 \\cdot \\vec{n}_2}{|\\vec{n}_1| |\\vec{n}_2|} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dot product of the normal vectors:\n$$ \\vec{n}_1 \\cdot \\vec{n}_2 = [100] \\cdot [111] = (1)(1) + (0)(1) + (0)(1) = 1 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the magnitudes of the normal vectors:\n$$ |\\vec{n}_1| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 $$\n$$ |\\vec{n}_2| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{3} $$\n\nSubstituting these values back into the cosine formula:\n$$ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\n\nThe angle $\\theta$ is therefore:\n$$ \\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) $$\n\nTo provide the numerical answer in degrees as requested, we compute this value:\n$$ \\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\approx \\arccos(0.577350269...) $$\n$$ \\theta \\approx 54.7356103...^{\\circ} $$\n\nRounding the result to $4$ significant figures gives:\n$$ \\theta \\approx 54.74^{\\circ} $$\nThis is the well-known angle of the sidewalls in pits anisotropically etched on a $(100)$ silicon wafer.",
