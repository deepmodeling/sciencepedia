It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution involves three main parts as requested: enumerating the distinct directions, constructing their corresponding unit vectors, and verifying their normalization. The final goal is to determine the total number of such directions, $N$.\n\nA direction family $\\langle hkl \\rangle$ in a cubic system is the set of all directions that are crystallographically equivalent to $[hkl]$ by the symmetry operations of the cubic group. This is generated by permuting the indices $h, k, l$ and applying all possible combinations of positive and negative signs. The problem starts with the prototype direction $[110]$.\n\n**1. Enumeration of Distinct Directions**\n\nThe set of indices to be permuted are $\\{1, 1, 0\\}$.\nFirst, we find all unique permutations of these three indices:\n- $(1, 1, 0)$\n- $(1, 0, 1)$\n- $(0, 1, 1)$\n\nNext, for each of these permutations, we apply all possible independent sign changes to the non-zero indices. An index of $0$ has no sign.\n\n**For the permutation $(1, 1, 0)$:**\nThe non-zero indices are the first and second. We can have $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0)$. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ combinations:\n- $[110]$\n- $[1\\bar{1}0]$ (where $\\bar{1}$ denotes $-1$)\n- $[\\bar{1}10]$\n- $[\\bar{1}\\bar{1}0]$\n\n**For the permutation $(1, 0, 1)$:**\nThe non-zero indices are the first and third. We can have $(\\pm 1, 0, \\pm 1)$. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ combinations:\n- $[101]$\n- $[10\\bar{1}]$\n- $[\\bar{1}01]$\n- $[\\bar{1}0\\bar{1}]$\n\n**For the permutation $(0, 1, 1)$:**\nThe non-zero indices are the second and third. We can have $(0, \\pm 1, \\pm 1)$. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ combinations:\n- $[011]$\n- $[01\\bar{1}]$\n- $[0\\bar{1}1]$\n- $[0\\bar{1}\\bar{1}]$\n\nAll directions generated are unique. For example, $[110]$ cannot be transformed into $[101]$ simply by a sign change. The problem statement requires that opposite directions (e.g., $[110]$ and $[\\bar{1}\\bar{1}0]$) are counted as distinct, which we have done in our enumeration.\n\nSumming the number of directions from each permutation group: $N = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12$.\nThere are a total of $12$ distinct directions in the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ family.\n\n**2. Construction of Unit Vectors**\n\nA crystallographic direction $[hkl]$ corresponds to a real-space vector $\\mathbf{r} = h\\,\\mathbf{a}_{1} + k\\,\\mathbf{a}_{2} + l\\,\\mathbf{a}_{3}$.\nUsing the given primitive vectors for the simple cubic lattice, $\\mathbf{a}_{1} = a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\mathbf{a}_{2} = a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, and $\\mathbf{a}_{3} = a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, the vector is:\n$$ \\mathbf{r} = h(a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) + k(a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) + l(a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = a(h\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + l\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) $$\nThe magnitude of this vector is $|\\mathbf{r}| = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}$. Given that the Cartesian basis vectors are orthonormal ($\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = 1$, $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = 0$, etc.), the magnitude is:\n$$ |\\mathbf{r}| = \\sqrt{a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)} = a\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2} $$\nThe unit vector, $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$, in the direction $[hkl]$ is obtained by normalizing $\\mathbf{r}$:\n$$ \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[hkl]} = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{|\\mathbf{r}|} = \\frac{a(h\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + l\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})}{a\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} = \\frac{h\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + l\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} $$\nFor any direction in the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ family, the indices $(h, k, l)$ are a permutation of $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0)$. For all such directions, the sum of squares of the indices is:\n$$ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = (\\pm 1)^2 + (\\pm 1)^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 $$\nTherefore, the normalization factor for all unit vectors in this family is $1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe $12$ unit vectors are:\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[110]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[1\\bar{1}0]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[\\bar{1}10]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[\\bar{1}\\bar{1}0]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[101]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[10\\bar{1}]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[\\bar{1}01]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[\\bar{1}0\\bar{1}]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[011]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[01\\bar{1}]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[0\\bar{1}1]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n- $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[0\\bar{1}\\bar{1}]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$\n\n**3. Verification of Normalization**\n\nWe must verify that these are indeed unit vectors, i.e., that their magnitude is $1$. Let us take a generic unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{[hkl]}$ from the list above, which has the general form $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(h\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + l\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$, where $\\{|h|,|k|,|l|\\}$ is a permutation of $\\{1,1,0\\}$.\nThe squared magnitude is $|\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}|^2 = \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$.\n$$ |\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}|^2 = \\left( \\frac{h\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + l\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{h\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + l\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) $$\n$$ |\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (h^2(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) + k^2(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) + l^2(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) + \\text{cross terms}) $$\nSince the basis vectors are orthonormal, all cross terms like $hk(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$ are zero, and the dot products of a vector with itself, such as $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, are equal to $1$.\n$$ |\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) $$\nAs established earlier, for any direction in the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ family, the sum of the squares of the indices is $h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 2$.\n$$ |\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (2) = 1 $$\nThe magnitude is $|\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}| = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. The normalization is therefore verified for all $12$ directions.\n\n**4. Final Reported Quantity**\n\nThe problem asks for $N$, the total number of distinct directions in the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ family. Based on the systematic enumeration, this number is $12$.",

Since $\\boldsymbol{G} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\boldsymbol{d}$, the vector $\\boldsymbol{G}$ is parallel to the vector $\\boldsymbol{d}$. This means that the crystallographic direction $[h \\, k \\, l]$ is perpendicular to the crystallographic plane $(h \\, k \\, l)$. This is a special property of cubic lattices and is not true for other crystal systems (e.g., hexagonal or tetragonal).\nTherefore, the angle between two planes $(h_1 \\, k_1 \\, l_1)$ and $(h_2 \\, k_2 \\, l_2)$ is identical to the angle between their normal directions, which are $[h_1 \\, k_1 \\, l_1]$ and $[h_2 \\, k_2 \\, l_2]$, respectively.\n\nFor wafer orientation in silicon (which has a diamond cubic structure, a special case of the face-centered cubic Bravais lattice), this geometric relationship is fundamental. Silicon wafers are commonly produced with a surface orientation of $(1 \\, 0 \\, 0)$ or $(1 \\, 1 \\, 1)$. The angle between these principal planes, $\\theta = \\arccos(1/\\sqrt{3})$, dictates the geometry for device fabrication. For example, anisotropic chemical etching, which proceeds at different rates along different crystallographic directions, can be used to create V-shaped grooves or other microstructures on a $(1 \\, 0 \\, 0)$ wafer, where the sloped walls of the groove are $(1 \\, 1 \\, 1)$ planes. The angle of these walls with respect to the wafer surface is precisely this calculated angle.\n\nTo find the numerical value of the angle in radians, rounded to $4$ significant figures:\n$$\n\\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\approx \\arccos(0.577350269...)\n$$\n$$\n\\theta \\approx 0.9553166 \\text{ radians}\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the angle is $0.9553$ radians.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n#### Part 1: Derivation of the Condition for a Direction in a Plane\nLet the orthonormal basis vectors be $\\mathbf{a}_{1}$, $\\mathbf{a}_{2}$, and $\\mathbf{a}_{3}$, which we can align with a Cartesian coordinate system such that $\\mathbf{a}_{1}=\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\mathbf{a}_{2}=\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, and $\\mathbf{a}_{3}=\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The problem states that the intercepts of the plane $(h\\,k\\,l)$ are the reciprocals of the Miller indices in units of the lattice parameter $a$. Thus, the intercepts on the respective axes are $\\frac{a}{h}$, $\\frac{a}{k}$, and $\\frac{a}{l}$.\n\nThe equation of a plane in intercept form is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{x}{x_0} + \\frac{y}{y_0} + \\frac{z}{z_0} = 1\n$$\nwhere $x_0$, $y_0$, and $z_0$ are the intercepts on the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively. For the crystallographic plane $(h\\,k\\,l)$, the intercepts are $x_0 = \\frac{a}{h}$, $y_0 = \\frac{a}{k}$, and $z_0 = \\frac{a}{l}$. Substituting these into the plane equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{x}{a/h} + \\frac{y}{a/k} + \\frac{z}{a/l} = 1\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to:\n$$\nh \\frac{x}{a} + k \\frac{y}{a} + l \\frac{z}{a} = 1\n$$\nor\n$$\nhx + ky + lz = a\n$$\nFor a plane described by the equation $Ax+By+Cz=D$, the vector $\\mathbf{N} = A\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + B\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + C\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ is normal to the plane. Therefore, for the plane $(h\\,k\\,l)$ in a cubic crystal, a normal vector $\\mathbf{N}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{N} = h\\mathbf{a}_{1} + k\\mathbf{a}_{2} + l\\mathbf{a}_{3}\n$$\nA crystallographic direction $[u\\,v\\,w]$ is represented by the vector $\\mathbf{D}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} = u\\mathbf{a}_{1} + v\\mathbf{a}_{2} + w\\mathbf{a}_{3}\n$$\nFor the direction $\\mathbf{D}$ to lie within the plane $(h\\,k\\,l)$, the vector $\\mathbf{D}$ must be orthogonal to the plane's normal vector $\\mathbf{N}$. The condition for orthogonality of two vectors is that their dot product is zero:\n$$\n\\mathbf{N} \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mathbf{N}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$:\n$$\n(h\\mathbf{a}_{1} + k\\mathbf{a}_{2} + l\\mathbf{a}_{3}) \\cdot (u\\mathbf{a}_{1} + v\\mathbf{a}_{2} + w\\mathbf{a}_{3}) = 0\n$$\nGiven that the basis vectors $\\mathbf{a}_{1}, \\mathbf{a}_{2}, \\mathbf{a}_{3}$ are orthonormal, their dot products satisfy $\\mathbf{a}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{j} = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Expanding the dot product yields:\n$$\nh u (\\mathbf{a}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{1}) + k v (\\mathbf{a}_{2} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{2}) + l w (\\mathbf{a}_{3} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{3}) + \\text{cross terms} = 0\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{a}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{1} = 1$, $\\mathbf{a}_{2} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{2} = 1$, $\\mathbf{a}_{3} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{3} = 1$, and all cross terms like $\\mathbf{a}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{2}$ are zero, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\nhu + kv + lw = 0\n$$\nThis is the condition that a crystallographic direction $[u\\,v\\,w]$ lies in the plane $(h\\,k\\,l)$ for a cubic crystal system. This relation is known as the Weiss zone law.\n\n#### Part 2: Determination of the Zone Axis\nThe zone axis is the direction $[u\\,v\\,w]$ that is common to both planes $(1\\,1\\,0)$ and $(1\\,\\bar{1}\\,0)$. This direction must satisfy the derived condition for each plane.\n\nFor the plane $(1\\,1\\,0)$, we have $h=1$, $k=1$, $l=0$. The condition is:\n$$\n(1)u + (1)v + (0)w = 0 \\implies u + v = 0\n$$\nFor the plane $(1\\,\\bar{1}\\,0)$, we have $h=1$, $k=-1$, $l=0$. The condition is:\n$$\n(1)u + (-1)v + (0)w = 0 \\implies u - v = 0\n$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for the indices $u,v,w$:\n1. $u + v = 0$\n2. $u - v = 0$\n\nFrom equation (2), we find $u = v$. Substituting this into equation (1):\n$$\nv + v = 0 \\implies 2v = 0 \\implies v = 0\n$$\nSince $u = v$, it follows that $u = 0$.\nThe equations place no restriction on the value of $w$. Thus, any direction of the form $[0\\,0\\,w]$ is a common direction.\nThe problem requires the direction to be expressed as the smallest integer triple. This is achieved by choosing the smallest non-zero integer for the non-zero component, which is $w=1$.\nTherefore, the unique zone axis is $[0\\,0\\,1]$.\n\n#### Part 3: Verification\nWe verify that the direction $[0\\,0\\,1]$ lies in both planes using the condition $hu+kv+lw=0$.\n\n- For plane $(1\\,1\\,0)$:\n  - $h=1$, $k=1$, $l=0$\n  - $u=0$, $v=0$, $w=1$\n  - Check: $(1)(0) + (1)(0) + (0)(1) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$. The condition is satisfied.\n\n- For plane $(1\\,\\bar{1}\\,0)$:\n  - $h=1$, $k=-1$, $l=0$\n  - $u=0$, $v=0$, $w=1$\n  - Check: $(1)(0) + (-1)(0) + (0)(1) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$. The condition is satisfied.\n\nThe verification is successful. The zone axis $[0\\,0\\,1]$ is the correct common direction for the planes $(1\\,1\\,0)$ and $(1\\,\\bar{1}\\,0)$.",
