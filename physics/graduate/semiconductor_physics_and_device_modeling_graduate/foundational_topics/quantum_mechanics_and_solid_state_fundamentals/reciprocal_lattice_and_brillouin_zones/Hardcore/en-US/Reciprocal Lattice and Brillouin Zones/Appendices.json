            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is a standard, well-posed problem in solid-state physics that is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe direct lattice is a two-dimensional square lattice with primitive vectors given by $\\mathbf{a}_1 = (a, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2 = (0, a)$. In vector notation, these are $\\mathbf{a}_1 = a\\hat{x}$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2 = a\\hat{y}$. The reciprocal lattice primitive vectors, $\\mathbf{b}_1$ and $\\mathbf{b}_2$, are defined by the relation $\\mathbf{a}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_j = 2\\pi \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nLet the reciprocal lattice vectors be $\\mathbf{b}_1 = b_{1x}\\hat{x} + b_{1y}\\hat{y}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_2 = b_{2x}\\hat{x} + b_{2y}\\hat{y}$. We apply the defining relations:\n$1$. $\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1 = (a\\hat{x}) \\cdot (b_{1x}\\hat{x} + b_{1y}\\hat{y}) = a b_{1x} = 2\\pi$. This implies $b_{1x} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$.\n$2$. $\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2 = (a\\hat{x}) \\cdot (b_{2x}\\hat{x} + b_{2y}\\hat{y}) = a b_{2x} = 0$. This implies $b_{2x} = 0$.\n$3$. $\\mathbf{a}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1 = (a\\hat{y}) \\cdot (b_{1x}\\hat{x} + b_{1y}\\hat{y}) = a b_{1y} = 0$. This implies $b_{1y} = 0$.\n$4$. $\\mathbf{a}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2 = (a\\hat{y}) \\cdot (b_{2x}\\hat{x} + b_{2y}\\hat{y}) = a b_{2y} = 2\\pi$. This implies $b_{2y} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$.\n\nCombining these results, the primitive vectors of the reciprocal lattice are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_1 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, 0\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{x}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_2 = \\left(0, \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{y}\n$$\nThe reciprocal lattice is also a square lattice, with a lattice constant of $\\frac{2\\pi}{a}$.\n\nA general reciprocal lattice point is given by a vector $\\mathbf{G}$ of the form $\\mathbf{G} = n_1\\mathbf{b}_1 + n_2\\mathbf{b}_2$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are integers.\n$$\n\\mathbf{G} = n_1 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{x}\\right) + n_2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{y}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}(n_1, n_2)\n$$\nThe first Brillouin zone (BZ) is the Wigner-Seitz cell of the reciprocal lattice, centered at the origin ($\\mathbf{k} = 0$). Its boundary is formed by the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors connecting the origin to the nearest reciprocal lattice points.\n\nThe squared magnitude of a reciprocal lattice vector is $|\\mathbf{G}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2(n_1^2 + n_2^2)$. The nearest neighbors to the origin correspond to the smallest non-zero value of $n_1^2 + n_2^2$, which is $1$. This occurs for the following pairs of $(n_1, n_2)$: $(1, 0)$, $(-1, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(0, -1)$. The corresponding nearest-neighbor vectors are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G}_1 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, 0\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{G}_2 = \\left(-\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, 0\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{G}_3 = \\left(0, \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{G}_4 = \\left(0, -\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)\n$$\nThe boundary of the first BZ consists of points $\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y)$ that are equidistant from the origin and a nearest reciprocal lattice point $\\mathbf{G}$. This condition is expressed as $|\\mathbf{k}| = |\\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{G}|$. Squaring both sides gives $|\\mathbf{k}|^2 = |\\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{G}|^2$, which simplifies to $2\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{G} = |\\mathbf{G}|^2$.\n\nWe apply this equation to each of the four nearest-neighbor vectors:\nFor $\\mathbf{G}_1 = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, 0)$:\n$2(k_x, k_y) \\cdot (\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, 0) = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2 \\implies 2k_x(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}) = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2 \\implies k_x = \\frac{\\pi}{a}$.\n\nFor $\\mathbf{G}_2 = (-\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, 0)$:\n$2(k_x, k_y) \\cdot (-\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, 0) = (-\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2 \\implies -2k_x(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}) = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2 \\implies k_x = -\\frac{\\pi}{a}$.\n\nFor $\\mathbf{G}_3 = (0, \\frac{2\\pi}{a})$:\n$2(k_x, k_y) \\cdot (0, \\frac{2\\pi}{a}) = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2 \\implies 2k_y(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}) = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2 \\implies k_y = \\frac{\\pi}{a}$.\n\nFor $\\mathbf{G}_4 = (0, -\\frac{2\\pi}{a})$:\n$2(k_x, k_y) \\cdot (0, -\\frac{2\\pi}{a}) = (-\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2 \\implies -2k_y(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}) = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a})^2 \\implies k_y = -\\frac{\\pi}{a}$.\n\nThe boundary lines of the first Brillouin zone are therefore $k_x = \\pm\\frac{\\pi}{a}$ and $k_y = \\pm\\frac{\\pi}{a}$. These four lines define a square in k-space centered at the origin. The vertices of the square are at $(\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{a}, \\pm\\frac{\\pi}{a})$.\n\nThe side length of this square is the distance from $k_x = -\\frac{\\pi}{a}$ to $k_x = \\frac{\\pi}{a}$, which is $\\frac{\\pi}{a} - (-\\frac{\\pi}{a}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$.\nThe area of the first Brillouin zone is the area of this square:\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{a^2}\n$$\nThe units are inverse length squared, which corresponds to $\\text{m}^{-2}$ if $a$ is in meters.\n\nThe perimeter of the first Brillouin zone is the perimeter of the square:\n$$\n\\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\times (\\text{side length}) = 4 \\times \\frac{2\\pi}{a} = \\frac{8\\pi}{a}\n$$\nThe units are inverse length, which corresponds to $\\text{m}^{-1}$ if $a$ is in meters.\n\nThe area of the first BZ is also equal to the area of the unit cell of the reciprocal lattice, which can be calculated as $|\\mathbf{b}_1 \\times \\mathbf{b}_2|$. For 2D vectors, this is the magnitude of the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors:\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\left|\\det\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2\\pi}{a} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\end{pmatrix}\\right| = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{a^2}\n$$\nThis confirms the previous result for the area.",

The dispersion relation becomes:\n$$\nE_{+\\,,\\bar{\\Gamma}\\bar{K}}(k) = E_{D} + \\hbar v_{0}k - \\lambda k^{3}\n$$\nAlong this direction, the energy at a given $k$ is decreased. Thus, for a constant energy (a Fermi surface), the magnitude of the wavevector $k$ will be smaller along $\\bar{\\Gamma}$–$\\bar{M}$ and larger along $\\bar{\\Gamma}$–$\\bar{K}$ compared to the average radius, leading to a hexagonal or snowflake-like shape of the Fermi surface.\n\nNext, we compute the group velocity, $\\mathbf{v}_{g}(\\mathbf{k})$, defined as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{g}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} E_{+}(\\mathbf{k})\n$$\nTo perform this calculation, we express the gradient operator $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}$ in polar coordinates $(k, \\theta)$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\frac{1}{k}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$ is the unit vector in the radial direction ($\\mathbf{k}/k$) and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ is the unit vector in the tangential direction.\n\nWe calculate the partial derivatives of $E_{+}(k, \\theta)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_{+}}{\\partial k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} \\left( E_{D} + \\hbar v_{0}k + \\lambda k^{3}\\cos(3\\theta) \\right) = \\hbar v_{0} + 3\\lambda k^{2}\\cos(3\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_{+}}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\left( E_{D} + \\hbar v_{0}k + \\lambda k^{3}\\cos(3\\theta) \\right) = -3\\lambda k^{3}\\sin(3\\theta)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the group velocity:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{g}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\left[ \\left(\\hbar v_{0} + 3\\lambda k^{2}\\cos(3\\theta)\\right)\\hat{\\mathbf{k}} + \\frac{1}{k}\\left(-3\\lambda k^{3}\\sin(3\\theta)\\right)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{g}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\left(v_{0} + \\frac{3\\lambda k^{2}}{\\hbar}\\cos(3\\theta)\\right)\\hat{\\mathbf{k}} - \\left(\\frac{3\\lambda k^{2}}{\\hbar}\\sin(3\\theta)\\right)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the component of the group velocity along the direction of propagation, which is the direction of $\\mathbf{k}$.
