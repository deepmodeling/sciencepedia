A closer look at the valence band maximum in materials like Si, Ge, and GaAs reveals that it is not a single parabolic band but is split into multiple bands. This practice delves into the quantum mechanical origin of this feature, attributing it to the spin-orbit interaction that couples an electron's spin with its orbital motion. By applying angular momentum algebra, you will derive the energy splitting between the valence bands at the $\\Gamma$ point, providing a fundamental understanding of the heavy-hole, light-hole, and split-off bands that govern optical transitions and hole transport .",

            "problem": "In the diamond and zincblende semiconductors silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide, the top of the valence band at the Brillouin zone center $\\Gamma$ arises from atomic-like $p$-orbitals, which carry orbital angular momentum $L=1$ and spin $S=\\frac{1}{2}$. The spin–orbit interaction is described by the operator $H_{\\mathrm{so}}=\\lambda\\,\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{S}$, where $\\lambda$ is a material-dependent coupling constant. The total angular momentum is $\\mathbf{J}=\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{S}$, with allowed values $J=\\frac{3}{2}$ and $J=\\frac{1}{2}$, giving rise to the fourfold $\\Gamma_{8\\mathrm{v}}$ and twofold $\\Gamma_{7\\mathrm{v}}$ valence states at $\\Gamma$, respectively. In the absence of strain and external fields, one of these manifolds forms the valence band maximum (VBM), and the other lies below it as the split-off band.\n\nStarting from the angular-momentum algebra implied by $H_{\\mathrm{so}}$ and the $p$-like character of the $\\Gamma$ valence states, derive which of the $J$ manifolds is at the VBM and obtain the energy of the split-off band relative to the VBM in terms of the conventional spin–orbit splitting energy $\\Delta_{so}$ as used in semiconductor physics.

It represents a standard application of quantum mechanical angular momentum theory to semiconductor band structure, a fundamental topic in solid-state physics.\n\nThe starting point is the spin-orbit Hamiltonian, $H_{\\mathrm{so}}=\\lambda\\,\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{S}$, acting on states with orbital angular momentum quantum number $L=1$ (from atomic $p$-orbitals) and spin quantum number $S=\\frac{1}{2}$. The total angular momentum is $\\mathbf{J}=\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{S}$.\n\nTo find the energy eigenvalues of $H_{\\mathrm{so}}$, we first express the operator $\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{S}$ in terms of the square of the total angular momentum operator, $\\mathbf{J}^2$, and the squares of the orbital and spin angular momentum operators, $\\mathbf{L}^2$ and $\\mathbf{S}^2$. From the definition $\\mathbf{J}=\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{S}$, we can write:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}^2 = (\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{S})\\cdot(\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{S}) = \\mathbf{L}^2 + \\mathbf{S}^2 + 2\\,\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{S}\n$$\nRearranging this identity gives an expression for $\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{S}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{J}^2 - \\mathbf{L}^2 - \\mathbf{S}^2)\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian can then be written as:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{so}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} (\\mathbf{J}^2 - \\mathbf{L}^2 - \\mathbf{S}^2)\n$$\nThe states of the system are best described in the coupled basis, denoted by $|L, S, J, M_J\\rangle$, where $J$ is the total angular momentum quantum number and $M_J$ is its projection. In this basis, the operators $\\mathbf{J}^2$, $\\mathbf{L}^2$, and $\\mathbf{S}^2$ are diagonal, with eigenvalues given by:\n- Eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{J}^2$: $\\hbar^2 J(J+1)$\n- Eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{L}^2$: $\\hbar^2 L(L+1)$\n- Eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{S}^2$: $\\hbar^2 S(S+1)$\n\nThe energy eigenvalues $E_J$ of the Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{so}}$ are the expectation values of the operator in these states.

To determine which manifold forms the valence band maximum (VBM), we need the sign of $\\lambda'$. For valence bands derived from atomic $p$-orbitals in typical semiconductors, the spin-orbit coupling constant $\\lambda$ (and thus $\\lambda'$) is positive. Therefore, $E_{3/2}  E_{1/2}$. This establishes that the $J=\\frac{3}{2}$ manifold ($\\Gamma_{8\\mathrm{v}}$) is at a higher energy and forms the VBM. The $J=\\frac{1}{2}$ manifold ($\\Gamma_{7\\mathrm{v}}$) lies at a lower energy and is referred to as the split-off band.\n\nThe conventional spin-orbit splitting energy, $\\Delta_{so}$, is defined as the energy separation between these two manifolds:\n$$\n\\Delta_{so} = E_{VBM} - E_{so\\_band} = E_{3/2} - E_{1/2} = \\frac{\\lambda'}{2} - (-\\lambda') = \\frac{3}{2}\\lambda'\n$$\nThe problem asks for the energy of the split-off band relative to the VBM.

It is a standard problem in semiconductor transport theory.\n\nWe begin with the semiclassical Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) in the Relaxation-Time Approximation (RTA) for electrons in a specific conduction band valley, labeled by the index $\\nu$. Under a spatially uniform, static electric field $\\mathcal{E}$, the BTE simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{q}{\\hbar} \\mathcal{E} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} f^{(\\nu)}(\\mathbf{k}) = -\\frac{f^{(\\nu)}(\\mathbf{k}) - f_{0}^{(\\nu)}(E(\\mathbf{k}))}{\\tau}\n$$\nwhere $q = -e$ is the electron charge, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $f^{(\\nu)}(\\mathbf{k})$ is the distribution function for electrons in valley $\\nu$, $f_{0}^{(\\nu)}$ is the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution, and $\\tau$ is the momentum-relaxation time, assumed to be constant and uniform across all valleys.\n\nIn the linear-response regime for a small electric field, the distribution function is a small perturbation from equilibrium: $f^{(\\nu)} = f_{0}^{(\\nu)} + \\delta f^{(\\nu)}$. We linearize the BTE by approximating $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} f^{(\\nu)} \\approx \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} f_{0}^{(\\nu)}$.

The problem states that the band gap generally decreases with increasing temperature from its value at absolute zero, $E_{g}(0)$. We are given two key asymptotic behaviors:\n1.  For low temperatures ($T \\to 0$), the band gap reduction is quadratic in temperature. This can be expressed as $E_{g}(T) \\approx E_{g}(0) - cT^2$ for some positive constant $c$. This behavior is a consequence of the freezing out of phonon populations, where the occupation number $n_{\\mathbf{q}} \\propto \\exp(-\\hbar \\omega_{\\mathbf{q}}/k_{B}T)$. The derivative $\\frac{dE_g}{dT}$ must approach $0$ as $T \\to 0$.\n2.  For high temperatures ($T \\to \\infty$), the band gap reduction is linear in temperature. This can be expressed as $E_{g}(T) \\approx E_{g}(0) - aT$ for some positive constant $a$. This arises from the classical limit of phonon statistics, where $n_{\\mathbf{q}} \\propto T$.\n\nWe need a function that smoothly interpolates between these two limits and is defined by two positive material parameters.

The equation becomes:\n$$E_{g}(T) \\approx E_{g}(0) - \\frac{\\alpha T^2}{\\beta}$$\nThis expression shows a quadratic dependence on temperature, satisfying the first constraint.
