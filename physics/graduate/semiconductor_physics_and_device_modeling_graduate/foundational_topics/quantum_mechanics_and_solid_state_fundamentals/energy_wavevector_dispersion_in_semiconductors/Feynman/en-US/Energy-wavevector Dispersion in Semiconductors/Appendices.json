A solution will be derived by analyzing each statement.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe energy of a free electron is given by the parabola $E^0(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$. In a weak periodic potential $V(x)$, this energy spectrum is perturbed. According to degenerate perturbation theory, the potential primarily affects states whose wavevectors are separated by a reciprocal lattice vector $nG$ and have nearly the same energy.\n\nThe most significant interaction for the lowest bands occurs at the Brillouin zone boundaries, $k = \\pm G/2$. At these points, the free-electron states $|k=G/2\\rangle$ and $|k=-G/2\\rangle$ are degenerate, since $E^0(G/2) = E^0(-G/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}(\\frac{G}{2})^2$. The potential component with wavevector $G$ couples these two states. The matrix element coupling them is $\\langle k-G|V|k \\rangle$. For $k=G/2$, this is $\\langle -G/2|V|G/2 \\rangle$. Using the Fourier expansion of $V(x)$, this matrix element is found to be the Fourier coefficient $V_G$. The problem statement notation $V_{nG}$ is unconventional, let's denote the standard Fourier series coefficients as $\\mathcal{V}_{nG}$. For a potential term $V_n \\cos(n G x)$, the corresponding Fourier coefficients are $\\mathcal{V}_{nG} = \\mathcal{V}_{-nG} = V_n/2$.\n\nThe solution of the $2 \\times 2$ secular determinant for the states near $k=G/2$ gives the perturbed energies:\n$$ E_{\\pm}(k) \\approx \\frac{E^0(k) + E^0(k-G)}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{E^0(k) - E^0(k-G)}{2}\\right)^2 + |\\mathcal{V}_G|^2} $$\nAt the zone boundary $k=G/2$, $E^0(k) = E^0(k-G)$, so the energies split into:\n$$ E_{\\pm}(G/2) = E^0(G/2) \\pm |\\mathcal{V}_G| $$\nThe lower energy, $E_{-}(G/2)$, corresponds to the top of the first band (valence band), and the upper energy, $E_{+}(G/2)$, corresponds to the bottom of the second band (conduction band). This opens a bandgap of magnitude $E_g = 2|\\mathcal{V}_G|$.\n\n#### Evaluation of Statement A\n**Statement A:** For $V(x) = V_G \\cos(G x)$ with $V_G \\neq 0$ and all other Fourier coefficients negligible, in the nearly-free electron limit the fundamental bandgap between the first and second bands is direct at $k = \\pm G/2$.\n\n**Analysis:** The potential is given as $V(x) = V_G \\cos(G x)$. This means the only non-zero Fourier coefficients are for $n=\\pm 1$, with $\\mathcal{V}_{G} = \\mathcal{V}_{-G} = V_G/2$. Since other coefficients are negligible, the only significant interaction creating a gap is between states separated by $G$. As shown above, this opens a gap at $k=\\pm G/2$. The valence band maximum (VBM) is $E_{VBM} = E_{-}(G/2)$ and the conduction band minimum (CBM) is $E_{CBM} = E_{+}(G/2)$. The dispersion relation shows that away from the zone boundary, the valence band energy decreases and the conduction band energy increases. Therefore, the VBM and the CBM both occur at the same wavevector, $k = \\pm G/2$. By definition, this is a direct bandgap.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Evaluation of Statement B\n**Statement B:** If, in addition to a nonzero $V_G$, there is a sizable second harmonic $V_{2G} \\cos(2 G x)$ with $|V_{2G}|$ sufficiently large compared to $|V_G|$, then the highest valence-band extremum can shift to $k = 0$, while the lowest conduction-band extremum remains at $k = \\pm G/2$, producing an indirect bandgap.\n\n**Analysis:** The presence of multiple Fourier components, $V_G$ and $V_{2G}$, modifies the entire band structure. Let's analyze the band extrema.\n- **CBM:** The CBM is determined by the splitting at $k=\\pm G/2$, which is primarily caused by $\\mathcal{V}_G$. The second harmonic $\\mathcal{V}_{2G}$ does not directly couple states at $k=G/2$ and $k=-G/2$ because their wavevector difference is $G$, not $2G$. Thus, the CBM is expected to remain at $k=\\pm G/2$.\n- **VBM:** The top of the valence band is more sensitive to the details of the potential. The shape of the first band $E_1(k)$ is determined by perturbative interactions with all higher bands. The location of the maximum can shift from $k=\\pm G/2$. Specifically, the curvature of the band at $k=0$ (related to the effective mass $m^*$) can change. The effective mass at $k=0$ for the first band is given by $\\frac{m}{m^*} = 1 + \\frac{2}{m}\\sum_{j>1} \\frac{|\\langle \\psi_{1,0}|p|\\psi_{j,0}\\rangle|^2}{E_{1,0}-E_{j,0}}$. The energy levels $E_{j,0}$ and the wavefunctions $\\psi_{j,0}$ are determined by the potential, including both $V_G$ and $V_{2G}$. If $|V_{2G}|$ is sufficiently large, it can significantly alter the energy level structure at $k=0$. This can make the denominator $(E_{1,0}-E_{j,0})$ smaller or the matrix element larger in such a way that the sum becomes a large positive number, causing $m/m^*$ to become negative (i.e., $m^*<0$). A negative effective mass at $k=0$ means the energy band has a maximum, not a minimum, at this point. If this maximum $E_1(0)$ is higher than the energy at the zone edge $E_1(G/2)$, the VBM shifts to $k=0$.\nThis phenomenon is confirmed by detailed calculations in one-dimensional models. For a potential $V(x) \\propto -[\\cos(Gx) + \\alpha\\cos(2Gx)]$, it has been shown that for a sufficiently large ratio $\\alpha$, the VBM indeed shifts from the zone edge to the zone center ($k=0$).\nThus, it is possible for the VBM to be at $k=0$ while the CBM remains at $k=\\pm G/2$. This constitutes an indirect bandgap.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Evaluation of Statement C\n**Statement C:** If $V_G$ is real and positive, the conduction-band minimum necessarily shifts to $k = 0$, so the bandgap is always indirect.\n\n**Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. As analyzed for statement A, for a potential $V(x) = V_G \\cos(Gx)$, the CBM is located at $k = \\pm G/2$. The sign of $V_G$ (whether it is positive or negative) affects the symmetry of the wavefunctions at the band edge but does not change the location of the extrema in $k$-space. The energy of the second band at $k=0$ corresponds to the unperturbed energy at $k=\\pm G$, $E^0(G) = \\hbar^2 G^2 / (2m)$. This is much higher than the energy of the CBM at the zone edge, $E_{+}(G/2) = \\hbar^2 G^2 / (8m) + |\\mathcal{V}_G|$. The claim that the CBM \"necessarily shifts to $k=0$\" is false. The bandgap in this simple case is direct at $k=\\pm G/2$.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n#### Evaluation of Statement D\n**Statement D:** In one dimension, indirect bandgaps cannot occur because all gaps open only at $k = \\pm G/2$.\n\n**Analysis:** This statement is a generalization that is proven false by the analysis of statement B. We have established that an indirect bandgap is possible in one dimension. The reasoning provided is also flawed. Gaps, which are regions of forbidden energy, open at the Brillouin zone boundaries ($k = \\pm nG/2$). However, the existence of a gap at a certain $k$-point does not require the band extrema (VBM and CBM) to be located at that same $k$-point. As shown in the analysis of B, the band shape can be altered by the potential in such a way that the VBM and CBM occur at different locations in the BZ, leading to an indirect bandgap.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.",

Differentiating implicitly with respect to $k$:\n$$\nE'(k) + 2\\alpha E(k) E'(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k}{m_0} \\implies E'(k)(1 + 2\\alpha E(k)) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k}{m_0}\n$$\nDifferentiating again:\n$$\nE''(k)(1 + 2\\alpha E(k)) + E'(k)(2\\alpha E'(k)) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_0}\n$$\nAt $k=0$, we have $E(0)=0$ and $E'(0)=0$. Substituting these gives:\n$$\nE''(0)(1+0) + 0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_0} \\implies E''(0) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_0}\n$$\nTo find $E^{(4)}(0)$, we differentiate twice more. First, let's find $E'''(k)$:\n$$\nE'''(k)(1+2\\alpha E(k)) + E''(k)(2\\alpha E'(k)) + 4\\alpha E'(k)E''(k) = 0 \\implies E'''(k)(1+2\\alpha E(k)) + 6\\alpha E'(k)E''(k) = 0\n$$\nDifferentiating a final time:\n$$\nE^{(4)}(k)(1+2\\alpha E(k)) + E'''(k)(2\\alpha E'(k)) + 6\\alpha[E''(k)]^2 + 6\\alpha E'(k)E'''(k) = 0\n$$\nEvaluating at $k=0$, where $E(0)=0$ and $E'(0)=0$:\n$$\nE^{(4)}(0)(1+0) + 0 + 6\\alpha[E''(0)]^2 + 0 = 0 \\implies E^{(4)}(0) = -6\\alpha[E''(0)]^2\n$$\nNow, substitute these derivatives back into the expression for the fractional mobility error:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{\\mu} \\approx \\frac{-6\\alpha[E''(0)]^2}{12 E''(0)}(\\Delta k)^2 = -\\frac{\\alpha E''(0)}{2}(\\Delta k)^2\n$$\nFinally, substituting $E''(0) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{\\mu} \\approx -\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_0}\\right)(\\Delta k)^2 = -\\frac{\\alpha \\hbar^2 (\\Delta k)^2}{2m_0}\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the leading-order fractional error. Now, we evaluate this numerically with the given parameters.\nFirst, we find the values of the parameters in SI units:\n$m_0 = 0.067 \\, m_e = 0.067 \\times (9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\text{kg}) = 6.10328708 \\times 10^{-32}\\,\\text{kg}$\n$E_g = 1.42\\,\\text{eV} = 1.42 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J}) = 2.27509082 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J}$\n$\\alpha = 1/E_g = 1/(2.27509082 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J}) \\approx 4.395423 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\text{J}^{-1}$\n$\\hbar = 1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n$\\Delta k = 1.00 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n\nNow, we compute the fractional error:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{\\mu} \\approx -\\frac{(1/E_g) \\hbar^2 (\\Delta k)^2}{2m_0}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{\\mu} \\approx -\\frac{(1/(2.27509082 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J})) \\times (1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s})^2 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{m}^{-1})^2}{2 \\times (6.10328708 \\times 10^{-32}\\,\\text{kg})}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{\\mu} \\approx -\\frac{(4.395423 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\text{J}^{-1}) \\times (1.11212665 \\times 10^{-68}\\,\\text{J}^2\\cdot\\text{s}^2) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\text{m}^{-2})}{1.220657416 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\text{kg}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{\\mu} \\approx -\\frac{4.888802 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s}^2\\cdot\\text{m}^{-2}}{1.220657416 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\text{kg}}\n$$\nSince $1\\,\\text{J} = 1\\,\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2\\cdot\\text{s}^{-2}$, the units in the numerator are $\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2\\cdot\\text{s}^{-2}\\cdot\\text{s}^2\\cdot\\text{m}^{-2} = \\text{kg}$, which cancels with the denominator, making the expression dimensionless as expected.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{\\mu} \\approx - \\frac{4.888802 \\times 10^{-34}}{1.220657416 \\times 10^{-31}} \\approx -4.00511 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{\\mu} \\approx -0.00400511\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the fractional error is $-0.004005$.",
