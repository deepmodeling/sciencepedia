            "problem": "A diamond-cubic crystal can be constructed by placing a two-atom basis on each point of a face-centered cubic (FCC) Bravais lattice. Let the conventional cubic cell have edge length $a$ and fractional coordinates defined with respect to this cube so that each atomic position is given by $(x/a, y/a, z/a)$ with $x, y, z \\in [0,a]$. The diamond basis, relative to any FCC Bravais lattice point, consists of atoms at fractional positions $(0,0,0)$ and $\\left(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$.

Provide as your final answer only this total number as an exact integer, with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the determination of the atomic positions within a conventional cubic cell of the diamond-cubic structure and for the calculation of the total number of atoms per cell, accounting for sharing.\n\nThe problem states that the diamond-cubic structure is formed by a face-centered cubic (FCC) Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis. The conventional cell is a cube of edge length $a$. The basis, relative to any FCC lattice point, consists of two atoms: one at $(0,0,0)$ and another at $(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$ in fractional coordinates.\n\nFirst, we identify the locations of all atoms within the geometric boundaries of a single conventional cell, which is a cube with vertices at positions like $(0,0,0)$, $(a,0,0)$, etc. We will express these positions in fractional coordinates relative to the cell edge length $a$. The fractional coordinates $(u,v,w)$ correspond to the real-space coordinates $(ua, va, wa)$. A point is within the cell if its coordinates $x, y, z$ are in the range $[0,a]$, which means its fractional coordinates $u,v,w$ are in the range $[0,1]$.\n\nThe first set of atoms originates from placing an atom at each FCC lattice point, corresponding to the basis vector $(0,0,0)$. The FCC lattice points for a conventional cell are located at the $8$ corners and $6$ face centers of the cube.\n\nThe fractional coordinates of the corner atoms are:\n$(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, $(0,0,1)$, $(1,1,0)$, $(1,0,1)$, $(0,1,1)$, $(1,1,1)$.\nThere are $8$ such atoms located at the corners of the conventional cell.\n\nThe fractional coordinates of the face-centered atoms are:\n$(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0)$, $(\\frac{1}{2},0,\\frac{1}{2})$, $(0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$, $(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},1)$, $(1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$, $(\\frac{1}{2},1,\\frac{1}{2})$.\nThere are $6$ such atoms located at the centers of the faces of the conventional cell.\n\nThe second set of atoms is generated by displacing every point of the FCC lattice by the second basis vector, $\\vec{b} = (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$. The position of each new atom is $\\vec{P} = \\vec{R}_{FCC} + \\vec{b}$, where $\\vec{R}_{FCC}$ is the fractional coordinate of an FCC lattice point. We must find which of these new positions fall strictly inside the conventional cell, meaning their fractional coordinates $(u,v,w)$ are all in the open interval $(0,1)$.\n\nLet's test the $14$ FCC lattice points of the conventional cell:\n1.  Displacing the corner points:\n    -   For $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (0,0,0)$, the new position is $\\vec{P} = (0,0,0) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$. All coordinates are in $(0,1)$, so this atom is strictly in the interior.\n    -   For any other corner point, at least one coordinate is $1$. For example, for $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (1,0,0)$, the new position is $\\vec{P} = (1,0,0) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{5}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$. The first coordinate is outside the range $[0,1]$, so this atom lies outside the reference cell. The same applies to all other $7$ corners.\n2.  Displacing the face-centered points:\n    -   For $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0)$, the new position is $\\vec{P} = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$. All coordinates are in $(0,1)$, so this is an interior atom.\n    -   Similarly for the other face centers on the planes $x=0$, $y=0$, or $z=0$:\n        -   $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (\\frac{1}{2},0,\\frac{1}{2}) \\implies \\vec{P} = (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$. This is an interior atom.\n        -   $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) \\implies \\vec{P} = (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$. This is an interior atom.\n    -   For face centers on planes $x=1$, $y=1$, or $z=1$:\n        -   $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},1) \\implies \\vec{P} = (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{5}{4})$. The third coordinate is outside $[0,1]$.\n        -   $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) \\implies \\vec{P} = (\\frac{5}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$. The first coordinate is outside $[0,1]$.\n        -   $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (\\frac{1}{2},1,\\frac{1}{2}) \\implies \\vec{P} = (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{5}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$. The second coordinate is outside $[0,1]$.\n\nSo, there are exactly $4$ atoms that are strictly in the interior of the conventional cell. Their fractional coordinates are:\n$(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$, $(\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$, $(\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$, $(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$.\n\nTo summarize the atomic positions requested:\n-   At the $8$ corners: $(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1)$.\n-   At the $6$ face centers: $(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0), (\\frac{1}{2},0,\\frac{1}{2}), (0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}), (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},1), (1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}), (\\frac{1}{2},1,\\frac{1}{2})$.\n-   Strictly in the interior: $(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}), (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4}), (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4}), (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$.\n\nFinally, we compute the total number of atoms contained within one conventional cell by accounting for the sharing of atoms on the boundaries.\n-   Contribution from corner atoms: There are $8$ atoms at the corners. Each corner atom is shared by $8$ adjacent cells. Thus, the contribution per cell is $8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1$ atom.\n-   Contribution from face-centered atoms: There are $6$ atoms on the face centers. Each face-centered atom is shared by $2$ adjacent cells. Thus, the contribution per cell is $6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3$ atoms.\n-   Contribution from interior atoms: There are $4$ atoms strictly inside the cell. These atoms are not shared with any other cell. Thus, their contribution is $4 \\times 1 = 4$ atoms.\n\nThe total number of atoms contained within one conventional cubic cell is the sum of these contributions:\nTotal atoms = (corner contribution) + (face-center contribution) + (interior contribution)\nTotal atoms = $1 + 3 + 4 = 8$.",

The number of lattice points is $8 \\times (\\frac{1}{8}) + 6 \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = 1 + 3 = 4$.\nSince the basis consists of $2$ atoms, the total number of atoms, $n_{\\text{diamond}}$, in the conventional unit cell is $n_{\\text{diamond}} = 4 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nThe volume of the cubic conventional unit cell is $V_{\\text{cell}} = a^3$, where $a$ is the lattice constant.\nThe volume of a single atomic sphere of radius $r$ is $V_{\\text{atom}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\n\nTo find the APF, we must relate the atomic radius $r$ to the lattice constant $a$.
