You will apply the concept of a Bravais lattice with a multi-atom basis to determine the precise location and number of atoms within a conventional unit cell .

            "problem": "A diamond-cubic crystal can be constructed by placing a two-atom basis on each point of a face-centered cubic (FCC) Bravais lattice. Let the conventional cubic cell have edge length $a$ and fractional coordinates defined with respect to this cube so that each atomic position is given by $(x/a, y/a, z/a)$ with $x, y, z \\in [0,a]$. The diamond basis, relative to any FCC Bravais lattice point, consists of atoms at fractional positions $(0,0,0)$ and $\\left(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the determination of the atomic positions within a conventional cubic cell of the diamond-cubic structure and for the calculation of the total number of atoms per cell, accounting for sharing.\n\nThe problem states that the diamond-cubic structure is formed by a face-centered cubic (FCC) Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis. The conventional cell is a cube of edge length $a$. The basis, relative to any FCC lattice point, consists of two atoms: one at $(0,0,0)$ and another at $(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$ in fractional coordinates.\n\nFirst, we identify the locations of all atoms within the geometric boundaries of a single conventional cell, which is a cube with vertices at positions like $(0,0,0)$, $(a,0,0)$, etc. We will express these positions in fractional coordinates relative to the cell edge length $a$. The fractional coordinates $(u,v,w)$ correspond to the real-space coordinates $(ua, va, wa)$. A point is within the cell if its coordinates $x, y, z$ are in the range $[0,a]$, which means its fractional coordinates $u,v,w$ are in the range $[0,1]$.\n\nThe first set of atoms originates from placing an atom at each FCC lattice point, corresponding to the basis vector $(0,0,0)$. The FCC lattice points for a conventional cell are located at the $8$ corners and $6$ face centers of the cube.\n\nThe fractional coordinates of the corner atoms are:\n$(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, $(0,0,1)$, $(1,1,0)$, $(1,0,1)$, $(0,1,1)$, $(1,1,1)$.\nThere are $8$ such atoms located at the corners of the conventional cell.\n\nThe fractional coordinates of the face-centered atoms are:\n$(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0)$, $(\\frac{1}{2},0,\\frac{1}{2})$, $(0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$, $(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},1)$, $(1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$, $(\\frac{1}{2},1,\\frac{1}{2})$.\nThere are $6$ such atoms located at the centers of the faces of the conventional cell.\n\nThe second set of atoms is generated by displacing every point of the FCC lattice by the second basis vector, $\\vec{b} = (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$. The position of each new atom is $\\vec{P} = \\vec{R}_{FCC} + \\vec{b}$, where $\\vec{R}_{FCC}$ is the fractional coordinate of an FCC lattice point. We must find which of these new positions fall strictly inside the conventional cell, meaning their fractional coordinates $(u,v,w)$ are all in the open interval $(0,1)$.\n\nLet's test the $14$ FCC lattice points of the conventional cell:\n1.  Displacing the corner points:\n    -   For $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (0,0,0)$, the new position is $\\vec{P} = (0,0,0) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$. All coordinates are in $(0,1)$, so this atom is strictly in the interior.\n    -   For any other corner point, at least one coordinate is $1$. For example, for $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (1,0,0)$, the new position is $\\vec{P} = (1,0,0) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{5}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$. The first coordinate is outside the range $[0,1]$, so this atom lies outside the reference cell. The same applies to all other $7$ corners.\n2.  Displacing the face-centered points:\n    -   For $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0)$, the new position is $\\vec{P} = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$. All coordinates are in $(0,1)$, so this is an interior atom.\n    -   Similarly for the other face centers on the planes $x=0$, $y=0$, or $z=0$:\n        -   $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (\\frac{1}{2},0,\\frac{1}{2}) \\implies \\vec{P} = (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$. This is an interior atom.\n        -   $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) \\implies \\vec{P} = (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$. This is an interior atom.\n    -   For face centers on planes $x=1$, $y=1$, or $z=1$:\n        -   $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},1) \\implies \\vec{P} = (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{5}{4})$. The third coordinate is outside $[0,1]$.\n        -   $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) \\implies \\vec{P} = (\\frac{5}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$. The first coordinate is outside $[0,1]$.\n        -   $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (\\frac{1}{2},1,\\frac{1}{2}) \\implies \\vec{P} = (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{5}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$. The second coordinate is outside $[0,1]$.\n\nSo, there are exactly $4$ atoms that are strictly in the interior of the conventional cell. Their fractional coordinates are:\n$(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$, $(\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$, $(\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$, $(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$.\n\nTo summarize the atomic positions requested:\n-   At the $8$ corners: $(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1)$.\n-   At the $6$ face centers: $(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0), (\\frac{1}{2},0,\\frac{1}{2}), (0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}), (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},1), (1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}), (\\frac{1}{2},1,\\frac{1}{2})$.\n-   Strictly in the interior: $(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}), (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4}), (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4}), (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$.\n\nFinally, we compute the total number of atoms contained within one conventional cell by accounting for the sharing of atoms on the boundaries.\n-   Contribution from corner atoms: There are $8$ atoms at the corners. Each corner atom is shared by $8$ adjacent cells. Thus, the contribution per cell is $8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1$ atom.\n-   Contribution from face-centered atoms: There are $6$ atoms on the face centers. Each face-centered atom is shared by $2$ adjacent cells. Thus, the contribution per cell is $6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3$ atoms.\n-   Contribution from interior atoms: There are $4$ atoms strictly inside the cell. These atoms are not shared with any other cell. Thus, their contribution is $4 \\times 1 = 4$ atoms.\n\nThe total number of atoms contained within one conventional cubic cell is the sum of these contributions:\nTotal atoms = (corner contribution) + (face-center contribution) + (interior contribution)\nTotal atoms = $1 + 3 + 4 = 8$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the planar atomic densities for the $(111)$ and $(001)$ planes of a diamond cubic crystal, followed by a ranking of these planes by density.\n\nThe diamond cubic structure is described as two interpenetrating face-centered cubic (FCC) lattices, displaced from each other by a vector $\\vec{\\delta} = \\frac{a}{4}(\\hat{x} + \\hat{y} + \\hat{z})$, where $a$ is the side length of the conventional cubic cell. We can define a basis of two atoms associated with each FCC lattice point $\\vec{R}_{FCC}$. The positions of the atoms in the crystal are given by $\\vec{P}_1 = \\vec{R}_{FCC}$ and $\\vec{P}_2 = \\vec{R}_{FCC} + \\vec{\\delta}$.\n\nThe planar atomic density, $\\sigma$, is defined as the number of atom centers, $N$, that lie exactly within a given crystallographic plane, divided by the area, $A$, of a two-dimensional primitive unit cell on that plane.\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{N}{A} $$\n\n**1. Analysis of the (001) Plane**\n\nWe first analyze the $(001)$ plane. For simplicity, we consider the plane passing through the origin, whose equation is $z=0$. We must identify all atom centers with a z-coordinate of $0$.\n\nThe positions of the atoms from the first FCC sublattice (basis 1) are the standard FCC sites. In the conventional cubic cell of side $a$, the sites with $z=0$ are the four corners on the $xy$-plane, e.g., $(0,0,0)$, $(a,0,0)$, $(0,a,0)$, $(a,a,0)$, and the face center at $(\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{a}{2},0)$.\n\nTo calculate the density, we can consider the two-dimensional unit cell on this plane formed by the face of the conventional cube. This is a square of side length $a$.\nThe area of this conventional 2D cell is $A_{(001),conv} = a^2$.\n\nThe number of atoms from basis 1 within this cell is the sum of contributions from the corner and face-centered atoms. In a 2D lattice, corner atoms are shared by four cells, and a centered atom is unshared.\n$$ N_{(001),basis1} = 4 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + 1 \\times 1 = 2 $$\n\nNext, we check for atoms from the second sublattice (basis 2). Their positions are $\\vec{P}_2 = \\vec{R}_{FCC} + (\\frac{a}{4},\\frac{a}{4},\\frac{a}{4})$. The z-coordinate of such an atom is $z = z_{FCC} + \\frac{a}{4}$. For an FCC lattice, the z-coordinates of lattice points are integer multiples of $\\frac{a}{2}$ (i.e., $z_{FCC} = n \\frac{a}{2}$ for some integer $n$). Thus, $z = n\\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{a}{4}$. For an atom to lie on the $z=0$ plane, we would require $n\\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{a}{4} = 0$, which implies $n = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Since $n$ must be an integer, no atom from the second basis lies on the $z=0$ plane.\n\nTherefore, the total number of atoms on the $(001)$ plane per conventional 2D cell of area $a^2$ is $N_{(001)} = 2$.\n\nThe planar density is the number of atoms per unit area. While we used a conventional cell, the density value itself is independent of the choice of cell (primitive or conventional).\n$$ \\sigma_{(001)} = \\frac{N_{(001)}}{A_{(001),conv}} = \\frac{2}{a^2} $$\nThe units are atoms per cm$^2$, as $a$ is given in cm.\n\n**2. Analysis of the (111) Plane**\n\nNow we analyze the $(111)$ plane. A plane from the $(111)$ family is described by the equation $x+y+z=C$, where $C$ is a constant. Let us consider the plane that passes through the three face-centered atoms $(\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{a}{2},0)$, $(\\frac{a}{2},0,\\frac{a}{2})$, and $(0,\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{a}{2})$. For all these points, the sum of coordinates is $a$, so the plane's equation is $x+y+z=a$.\n\nThe atoms on this plane form a hexagonal lattice. To find the area of the 2D primitive unit cell, we can define two non-collinear primitive translation vectors, $\\vec{u}_1$ and $\\vec{u}_2$, that connect atoms on this plane. Let's choose the vectors connecting the atom at $\\vec{P}_A = (\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{a}{2},0)$ to its neighbors at $\\vec{P}_B = (\\frac{a}{2},0,\\frac{a}{2})$ and $\\vec{P}_C = (0,\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{a}{2})$.\n$$ \\vec{u}_1 = \\vec{P}_B - \\vec{P}_A = \\left(0, -\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\vec{u}_2 = \\vec{P}_C - \\vec{P}_A = \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2}\\right) $$\nThese two vectors form a rhombus which is a primitive unit cell of the 2D lattice. The area of this cell is given by the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors.\n$$ \\vec{u}_1 \\times \\vec{u}_2 = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\hat{x}  \\hat{y}  \\hat{z} \\\\ 0  -\\frac{a}{2}  \\frac{a}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{a}{2}  0  \\frac{a}{2} \\end{pmatrix} = -\\frac{a^2}{4}\\hat{x} - \\frac{a^2}{4}\\hat{y} - \\frac{a^2}{4}\\hat{z} = -\\frac{a^2}{4}(1,1,1) $$\nThe area $A_{(111)}$ is the magnitude of this vector:\n$$ A_{(111)} = \\left| -\\frac{a^2}{4}(1,1,1) \\right| = \\frac{a^2}{4}\\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}a^2}{4} $$\n\nThe number of atoms per primitive cell in a 2D lattice is $N=1$. These atoms are from the first basis (the FCC sites).\n\nNext, we check for atoms from the second basis. Their positions are $\\vec{P}_2 = \\vec{R}_{FCC} + (\\frac{a}{4},\\frac{a}{4},\\frac{a}{4})$. For such an atom to lie on the plane $x+y+z=a$, the sum of its coordinates must be $a$.\nThe sum of coordinates for a basis-2 atom is $(x_{FCC}+y_{FCC}+z_{FCC}) + 3\\frac{a}{4}$. The sum of coordinates for any FCC lattice point, $x_{FCC}+y_{FCC}+z_{FCC}$, is an integer multiple of $a$, i.e., $Na$ for $N \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. So, the sum for a basis-2 atom is $Na + \\frac{3a}{4}$.\nWe require $Na + \\frac{3a}{4} = a$, which means $N = \\frac{1}{4}$. This is not an integer. Therefore, no atom from the second basis lies on the plane $x+y+z=a$.\n\nThe total number of atoms in the primitive 2D cell on the $(111)$ plane is $N_{(111)}=1$. The planar density is:\n$$ \\sigma_{(111)} = \\frac{N_{(111)}}{A_{(111)}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}a^2}{4}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}a^2} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3a^2} $$\n\n**3. Ranking of Planar Densities**\n\nWe now compare the densities of the two planes:\n$$ \\sigma_{(111)} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3a^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sigma_{(001)} = \\frac{2}{a^2} $$\nTo compare them, we compare the numerical coefficients $\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ and $2$.\n$$ \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\approx \\frac{4 \\times 1.732}{3} \\approx \\frac{6.928}{3} \\approx 2.309 $$\nSince $2.309  2$, we have $\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}  2$.\nTherefore, $\\sigma_{(111)}  \\sigma_{(001)}$.\n\nThe ranking of the planes from higher to lower atomic packing density is: $(111)$ plane, then $(001)$ plane.\n\nThe final symbolic expressions for the densities are $\\sigma_{(111)} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3a^2}$ and $\\sigma_{(001)} = \\frac{2}{a^2}$.",

Let the atomic form factors for these atoms be $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$, respectively.\n$$\nS_{\\text{basis}}\\left(hkl\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{2} f_{j} \\exp\\!\\left(2\\pi i \\left(h x_{j} + k y_{j} + l z_{j}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nS_{\\text{basis}}\\left(hkl\\right) = f_{1} \\exp\\!\\left(0\\right) + f_{2} \\exp\\!\\left(2\\pi i \\left(h\\tfrac{1}{4} + k\\tfrac{1}{4} + l\\tfrac{1}{4}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nS_{\\text{basis}}\\left(hkl\\right) = f_{1} + f_{2} \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi i}{2} \\left(h+k+l\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nNow we specialize for the diamond and zincblende structures.\nFor the diamond (dia) structure, both atoms are of species $A$, so $f_{1}=f_{A}$ and $f_{2}=f_{A}$.\n$$\nS_{\\text{basis, dia}}\\left(hkl\\right) = f_{A} \\left(1 + \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi i}{2} \\left(h+k+l\\right)\\right)\\right)\n$$\nFor the zincblende (zb) structure, the atom at $\\left(0,0,0\\right)$ is species $A$ and the atom at $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{4},\\tfrac{1}{4},\\tfrac{1}{4}\\right)$ is species $B$, so $f_{1}=f_{A}$ and $f_{2}=f_{B}$.\n$$\nS_{\\text{basis, zb}}\\left(hkl\\right) = f_{A} + f_{B} \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi i}{2} \\left(h+k+l\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThe value of $S_{\\text{basis}}$ depends on the sum of the Miller indices, $S = h+k+l$. The phase factor is $\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi i S}{2}\\right)$. We evaluate this for each reflection:\n\n1.  Reflection $\\left(111\\right)$: $S = 1+1+1 = 3$.

Reflection $\\left(200\\right)$: $S = 2+0+0 = 2$. The phase factor is $\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\pi i\\right) = -1$.\n    -   Diamond: $S_{\\text{basis, dia}}\\left(200\\right) = f_{A}\\left(1-1\\right) = 0$.\n        $I_{\\text{dia}}\\left(200\\right) = 0$. This reflection is extinguished by the basis interference.\n    -   Zincblende: $S_{\\text{basis, zb}}\\left(200\\right) = f_{A} - f_{B}$.\n        $I_{\\text{zb}}\\left(200\\right) = \\left|f_{A} - f_{B}\\right|^{2} = \\left(f_{A} - f_{B}\\right)^{2}$.
