Their formation is a classic thermodynamic trade-off between the energetic cost to create an imperfection and the resulting increase in the crystal's configurational entropy. This exercise  will guide you from the first principles of statistical mechanics to derive the equilibrium concentration of vacancies, revealing its strong exponential dependence on temperature and formation energy. Mastering this concept is essential for predicting how defect populations change with material processing conditions.",

We choose the zero of energy such that the perfect site has energy $0$, while a defective site costs the formation energy $E_f$.

Defects can introduce localized electronic states within the band gap, acting as traps or recombination centers that profoundly influence device performance. The charge state of a defect is not fixed; it depends on the position of the Fermi level, $E_F$, relative to the defect's characteristic charge transition levels.

Express your final result as a unitless decimal fraction, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The user wants to compute the fraction of silicon vacancies in the negative charge state, given the Fermi level, the charge transition level, and the temperature. This is a problem in semiconductor physics that can be solved using the principles of equilibrium statistical mechanics.\n\nFirst, we establish the framework for calculating defect concentrations. The equilibrium concentration of a defect (in this case, a silicon vacancy $V$) in a specific charge state $q$, denoted as $[V^q]$, is given by statistical mechanics as:\n$$[V^q] = N_{sites} g_q \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f(V^q; E_F)}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $N_{sites}$ is the number of atomic sites where the vacancy can form (e.g., the number of silicon atoms per unit volume), $g_q$ is a degeneracy factor for the charge state $q$, $E_f(V^q; E_F)$ is the formation energy of the vacancy in charge state $q$ when the Fermi level is at $E_F$, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The degeneracy factor $g_q$ accounts for electronic (spin, orbital) and vibrational degrees of freedom.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of vacancies in the negative charge state, which we denote as $f_{-1}$. Since the problem only concerns the neutral ($q=0$) and negative ($q=-1$) charge states, this fraction is:\n$$f_{-1} = \\frac{[V^{-1}]}{[V^0] + [V^{-1}]}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by $[V^0]$:\n$$f_{-1} = \\frac{[V^{-1}]/[V^0]}{1 + [V^{-1}]/[V^0]}$$\nThe ratio of concentrations $[V^{-1}]/[V^0]$ is:\n$$\\frac{[V^{-1}]}{[V^0]} = \\frac{N_{sites} g_{-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f(V^{-1}; E_F)}{k_B T}\\right)}{N_{sites} g_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f(V^0; E_F)}{k_B T}\\right)} = \\frac{g_{-1}}{g_0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f(V^{-1}; E_F) - E_f(V^0; E_F)}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe problem statement makes several simplifying assumptions: \"identical vibrational entropy contributions for the neutral and negative charge states, and equal configurational degeneracy for these two charge states\". This implies that the total degeneracy factors are equal, i.e., $g_{-1} = g_0$. Therefore, the ratio of degeneracies $g_{-1}/g_0 = 1$, and the expression simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{[V^{-1}]}{[V^0]} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f(V^{-1}; E_F) - E_f(V^0; E_F)}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we relate the formation energies to the Fermi level $E_F$. The formation energy of a defect in charge state $q$ is a linear function of the Fermi level:\n$$E_f(V^q; E_F) = E_f(V^q; E_{ref}) + q(E_F - E_{ref})$$\nwhere $E_{ref}$ is an arbitrary reference energy level. Let's use the conduction band minimum $E_c$ as our reference, so $E_{ref} = E_c$. Then:\n$$E_f(V^0; E_F) = E_f(V^0; E_c) + 0 \\cdot (E_F - E_c) = E_f(V^0; E_c)$$\n$$E_f(V^{-1}; E_F) = E_f(V^{-1}; E_c) - 1 \\cdot (E_F - E_c) = E_f(V^{-1}; E_c) - (E_F - E_c)$$\nThe difference in formation energies at a given $E_F$ is then:\n$$E_f(V^{-1}; E_F) - E_f(V^0; E_F) = E_f(V^{-1}; E_c) - E_f(V^0; E_c) - (E_F - E_c)$$\n\nNow, we use the thermodynamic definition of the charge transition level $\\varepsilon(q/q')$. The level $\\varepsilon(0/-)$ is defined as the Fermi level at which the formation energies of the neutral and negative charge states are equal:\n$$E_f(V^0; E_F=\\varepsilon(0/-)) = E_f(V^{-1}; E_F=\\varepsilon(0/-))$$\nSubstituting the expressions for formation energies:\n$$E_f(V^0; E_c) = E_f(V^{-1}; E_c) - (\\varepsilon(0/-) - E_c)$$\nRearranging gives us the physical meaning of the transition level relative to the reference energy:\n$$\\varepsilon(0/-) - E_c = E_f(V^{-1}; E_c) - E_f(V^0; E_c)$$\nThis is the difference in formation energies when the Fermi level is at the conduction band edge.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the formation energy difference at an arbitrary $E_F$:\n$$E_f(V^{-1}; E_F) - E_f(V^0; E_F) = (\\varepsilon(0/-) - E_c) - (E_F - E_c) = \\varepsilon(0/-) - E_F$$\nThe choice of the reference energy level $E_c$ cancels out, as expected.\n\nThe ratio of concentrations is now:\n$$\\frac{[V^{-1}]}{[V^0]} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon(0/-) - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - \\varepsilon(0/-)}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this back into the formula for the fraction $f_{-1}$:\n$$f_{-1} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - \\varepsilon(0/-)}{k_B T}\\right)}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - \\varepsilon(0/-)}{k_B T}\\right)}$$\nBy dividing the numerator and denominator by the exponential term, we arrive at the familiar form of a Fermi-Dirac distribution function:\n$$f_{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - \\varepsilon(0/-)}{k_B T}\\right) + 1} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon(0/-) - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)}$$\nThis shows that the charge transition level $\\varepsilon(0/-)$ acts as an effective energy level for the occupation of the negative charge state.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nThe givens are:\n-   Charge transition level: $\\varepsilon(0/-) = E_c - 0.2\\,\\text{eV}$\n-   Fermi level: $E_F = E_c - 0.05\\,\\text{eV}$\n-   Temperature: $T = 300\\,\\text{K}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy difference $\\varepsilon(0/-) - E_F$:\n$$\\varepsilon(0/-) - E_F = (E_c - 0.2\\,\\text{eV}) - (E_c - 0.05\\,\\text{eV}) = -0.15\\,\\text{eV}$$\nNext, we calculate the thermal energy $k_B T$ in electron-volts. Using the Boltzmann constant $k_B \\approx 8.61733 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{K}^{-1}$:\n$$k_B T \\approx (8.61733 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (300\\,\\text{K}) \\approx 0.025852\\,\\text{eV}$$\nNow we compute the argument of the exponential function:\n$$\\frac{\\varepsilon(0/-) - E_F}{k_B T} = \\frac{-0.15\\,\\text{eV}}{0.025852\\,\\text{eV}} \\approx -5.8023$$\nFinally, we calculate the fraction $f_{-1}$:\n$$f_{-1} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-5.8023)} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.003019} = \\frac{1}{1.003019} \\approx 0.996989$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$f_{-1} \\approx 0.9970$$\nThis result is physically reasonable. The Fermi level ($E_c - 0.05\\,\\text{eV}$) is significantly higher than the transition level ($E_c - 0.2\\,\\text{eV}$), indicating a high availability of electrons. Consequently, the vacancy defect is predominantly found in its captured-electron (negative) charge state.",
