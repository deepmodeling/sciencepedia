The conduction-band density of states $g_c(E)$ is defined such that $g_c(E)\\,\\mathrm{d}E$ is the number of available quantum states per unit volume in the energy interval $[E, E+\\mathrm{d}E]$. Using the fundamental state counting in wavevector space, where the number of $\\mathbf{k}$-states per unit volume in an element $\\mathrm{d}^{3}k$ is $1/(2\\pi)^{3}$, and the parabolic dispersion, one can express $g_c(E)$ in terms of $k$, $\\mathrm{d}k/\\mathrm{d}E$, and dimensionless degeneracy factors. In this construction, a characteristic prefactor of the form $\\left(2 m_c^{*}/\\hbar^{2}\\right)^{3/2}$ arises from the Jacobian associated with transforming from $\\mathbf{k}$-space to energy.\n\nStarting from the above foundations and performing dimensional analysis only (do not assume or invoke any pre-derived density-of-states formulas), determine the dimensions of the prefactor $\\left(2 m_c^{*}/\\hbar^{2}\\right)^{3/2}$ in terms of the base dimensions of mass $M$, length $L$, and time $T$.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard exercise in dimensional analysis within the context of solid-state physics. All necessary information is provided. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary task is to determine the dimensions of the prefactor $\\left(2 m_c^{*}/\\hbar^{2}\\right)^{3/2}$ in terms of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$). The secondary task is to use this result to verify the consistency of the dimensions of the density of states, $g_c(E)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the dimensions of the individual components of the prefactor. The numerical factor $2$ is a dimensionless pure number and can be ignored for dimensional analysis. The two physical quantities are the electron effective mass, $m_c^{*}$, and the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$.\n\nThe dimension of the effective mass $m_c^{*}$ is simply that of mass:\n$$\n[m_c^{*}] = M\n$$\n\nThe dimension of the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$, can be derived from several fundamental physical relations. A convenient one is the Planck-Einstein relation for the energy of a photon, $E = \\hbar\\omega$, where $E$ is energy and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\nThe dimension of energy $E$ is mass times velocity squared, or work (force times distance):\n$$\n[E] = M [v^2] = M \\left( \\frac{L}{T} \\right)^2 = M L^{2} T^{-2}\n$$\nThe dimension of angular frequency $\\omega$ is the reciprocal of time:\n$$\n[\\omega] = T^{-1}\n$$\nFrom $E = \\hbar\\omega$, we can solve for the dimensions of $\\hbar$:\n$$\n[\\hbar] = \\frac{[E]}{[\\omega]} = \\frac{M L^{2} T^{-2}}{T^{-1}} = M L^{2} T^{-1}\n$$\n\nNow, we can find the dimensions of the term inside the parenthesis of the prefactor, $m_c^{*}/\\hbar^2$:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{m_c^{*}}{\\hbar^{2}}\\right] = \\frac{[m_c^{*}]}{[\\hbar]^{2}} = \\frac{M}{\\left( M L^{2} T^{-1} \\right)^{2}} = \\frac{M}{M^{2} L^{4} T^{-2}} = M^{-1} L^{-4} T^{2}\n$$\n\nFinally, we apply the exponent $3/2$ to find the dimensions of the complete prefactor:\n$$\n\\left[ \\left(\\frac{m_c^{*}}{\\hbar^{2}}\\right)^{3/2} \\right] = \\left( M^{-1} L^{-4} T^{2} \\right)^{3/2} = M^{-1 \\times \\frac{3}{2}} L^{-4 \\times \\frac{3}{2}} T^{2 \\times \\frac{3}{2}} = M^{-3/2} L^{-6} T^{3}\n$$\nThis corresponds to the dimensional form $M^{\\alpha} L^{\\beta} T^{\\gamma}$ with $\\alpha = -3/2$, $\\beta = -6$, and $\\gamma = 3$.\n\nNext, we perform the requested verification. The density of states $g_c(E)$ is defined as the number of available quantum states per unit volume per unit energy. The number of states is a dimensionless count. Therefore, the dimensions of $g_c(E)$ are:\n$$\n[g_c(E)] = \\frac{[\\text{states}]}{[\\text{volume}][\\text{energy}]} = \\frac{1}{L^{3} \\cdot (M L^{2} T^{-2})} = M^{-1} L^{-5} T^{2}\n$$\n\nThe problem implies that the derivation of $g_c(E)$ leads to an expression proportional to the prefactor and an energy-dependent term. The standard derivation for a $3\\text{D}$ parabolic band yields:\n$$\ng_c(E) = C \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2 m_c^{*}}{\\hbar^{2}}\\right)^{3/2} \\sqrt{E - E_c}\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a dimensionless constant (equal to $1/(2\\pi^2)$). We will now find the dimensions of this theoretical expression. The term $\\sqrt{E-E_c}$ has the dimension of the square root of energy:\n$$\n[\\sqrt{E-E_c}] = [E]^{1/2} = \\left( M L^{2} T^{-2} \\right)^{1/2} = M^{1/2} L^{1} T^{-1}\n$$\nThe dimensions of the full expression for $g_c(E)$ are the product of the dimensions of the prefactor and the dimensions of the energy term:\n$$\n[g_c(E)]_{theory} = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{m_c^{*}}{\\hbar^{2}}\\right)^{3/2} \\right] \\cdot [\\sqrt{E-E_c}] = \\left( M^{-3/2} L^{-6} T^{3} \\right) \\cdot \\left( M^{1/2} L T^{-1} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n[g_c(E)]_{theory} = M^{(-3/2) + (1/2)} L^{-6+1} T^{3-1} = M^{-1} L^{-5} T^{2}\n$$\nThis result, $[g_c(E)]_{theory} = M^{-1} L^{-5} T^{2}$, is identical to the dimension derived from the definition, $[g_c(E)] = M^{-1} L^{-5} T^{2}$. The dimensional consistency is thus verified.\n\nThe problem asks for the ordered triple of exponents $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$ corresponding to the dimensions of the prefactor $\\left(2 m_c^{*}/\\hbar^{2}\\right)^{3/2}$. Based on our analysis, the dimensions are $M^{-3/2} L^{-6} T^{3}$.\nThus, the exponents are $\\alpha = -3/2$, $\\beta = -6$, and $\\gamma = 3$. The final answer is the row matrix of these exponents.",

Relative Change $\\Delta$**\n\nThe relative change is defined as:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{g_{\\text{Kane}}(E) - g_{\\text{parabolic}}(E)}{g_{\\text{parabolic}}(E)} = \\frac{g_{\\text{Kane}}(\\varepsilon)}{g_{\\text{parabolic}}(\\varepsilon)} - 1$$\nWe compute the ratio of the two DOS expressions:\n$$\\frac{g_{\\text{Kane}}(\\varepsilon)}{g_{\\text{parabolic}}(\\varepsilon)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2} (m^{\\star})^{3/2}}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\sqrt{\\varepsilon(1 + \\alpha \\varepsilon)} (1 + 2\\alpha \\varepsilon)}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2} (m^{\\star})^{3/2}}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\sqrt{\\varepsilon}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}\\sqrt{1 + \\alpha \\varepsilon}}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}} (1 + 2\\alpha \\varepsilon)$$\n$$\\frac{g_{\\text{Kane}}(\\varepsilon)}{g_{\\text{parabolic}}(\\varepsilon)} = \\sqrt{1 + \\alpha \\varepsilon} (1 + 2\\alpha \\varepsilon)$$\nTherefore, the relative change $\\Delta$ is:\n$$\\Delta = \\sqrt{1 + \\alpha \\varepsilon} (1 + 2\\alpha \\varepsilon) - 1$$\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the values $\\varepsilon = 50\\,\\mathrm{meV} = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\alpha = 0.70\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}$. The product $\\alpha\\varepsilon$ is a dimensionless quantity:\n$$\\alpha\\varepsilon = (0.70\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}) \\times (0.050\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = 0.035$$\nNow we substitute this value into the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = \\sqrt{1 + 0.035} (1 + 2 \\times 0.035) - 1$$\n$$\\Delta = \\sqrt{1.035} (1 + 0.070) - 1$$\n$$\\Delta = \\sqrt{1.035} (1.070) - 1$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\sqrt{1.035} \\approx 1.01734948$$\n$$\\Delta \\approx 1.01734948 \\times 1.070 - 1$$\n$$\\Delta \\approx 1.0885639436 - 1$$\n$$\\Delta \\approx 0.0885639436$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.08856$. This indicates an $8.856\\%$ increase in the density of states at this energy due to nonparabolicity.",
