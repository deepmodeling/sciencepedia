The phenomenon of velocity saturation in semiconductors due to high-field effects, such as increased scattering from optical phonons, is a cornerstone of semiconductor device physics. The given values for electron mobility in Silicon at room temperature are standard. The task of constructing an empirical model that interpolates between two asymptotic physical regimes (Ohmic and saturation) is a common and valid practice in physics and engineering. The simplest rational interpolation provides a well-defined mathematical problem. The problem is self-contained. The characteristic field $E_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ is defined, which, in conjunction with the mobility $\\mu_n$, implicitly defines the saturation velocity $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, ensuring all necessary parameters for the model construction are present. The data is physically consistent; the derived saturation velocity of $v_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\mu_n E_{\\mathrm{sat}} = (1350~\\mathrm{cm^{2}/(V\\cdot s)}) \\times (10^{4}~\\mathrm{V/cm}) = 1.35 \\times 10^{7}~\\mathrm{cm/s}$ is a textbook value for electrons in Si. The problem is objective, well-posed, and free from any of the specified invalidating flaws.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\nEnd of Validation\n\nThe task is to construct the simplest rational function $v_d(E)$ that models the electron drift velocity. A rational function is a ratio of two polynomials. Let this be $v_d(E) = P(E)/Q(E)$.\n\nCondition (i) requires that for low electric fields ($E \\to 0$), the behavior is Ohmic, i.e., $v_d(E) \\approx \\mu_n E$. This indicates that the lowest order term in the numerator $P(E)$ should be proportional to $E$, and the lowest order term in the denominator $Q(E)$ should be a constant. The simplest choice that satisfies this is $P(E) = c_1 E$ and $Q(E) = c_2 + c_3 E$, where $c_1, c_2, c_3$ are constants.\nThe model is thus $v_d(E) = \\frac{c_1 E}{c_2 + c_3 E}$. For $E \\to 0$, this becomes $v_d(E) \\approx \\frac{c_1}{c_2}E$. To match $v_d = \\mu_n E$, we must have $\\frac{c_1}{c_2} = \\mu_n$. We can simplify this by setting $c_1 = \\mu_n$ and $c_2 = 1$. The model is now reduced to $v_d(E) = \\frac{\\mu_n E}{1 + c_3 E}$.\n\nCondition (ii) requires that for high electric fields ($E \\to \\infty$), the velocity saturates at a constant value $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. Taking the limit of our model as $E \\to \\infty$:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\lim_{E\\to\\infty} v_d(E) = \\lim_{E\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\mu_n E}{1 + c_3 E} = \\lim_{E\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\mu_n}{1/E + c_3} = \\frac{\\mu_n}{c_3}$$\nThis shows that our chosen form satisfies the saturation requirement. From this relation, we find the constant $c_3 = \\mu_n / v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$.\n\nSubstituting $c_3$ back into our model gives:\n$$v_d(E) = \\frac{\\mu_n E}{1 + (\\mu_n/v_{\\mathrm{sat}})E}$$\nThe problem introduces a characteristic field $E_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. This field marks the transition from the linear to the saturated regime. A natural definition for this field is the point where the low-field linear extrapolation would intersect the saturation velocity, i.e., $\\mu_n E_{\\mathrm{sat}} = v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. Using this definition, we can express the ratio $\\mu_n / v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ as $1/E_{\\mathrm{sat}}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the model yields the final form for the velocity-field relationship:\n$$v_d(E) = \\frac{\\mu_n E}{1 + E/E_{\\mathrm{sat}}}$$\nThis is the required simplest rational interpolation, commonly known as the Caughey-Thomas model for the case where the velocity exponent is $1$.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the numerical values.\nGiven:\n$\\mu_n = 1350~\\mathrm{cm^{2}/(V\\cdot s)}$\n$E_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 10^4~\\mathrm{V/cm}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the saturation velocity $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$:\n$v_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\mu_n E_{\\mathrm{sat}} = (1350~\\mathrm{cm^{2}/(V\\cdot s)}) \\times (10^4~\\mathrm{V/cm}) = 1.35 \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{cm/s}$.\n\nNow we evaluate $v_d(E)$ for the three specified electric fields.\n\n1. For $E = 10^2~\\mathrm{V/cm}$:\n$v_d(10^2~\\mathrm{V/cm}) = \\frac{(1350)(10^2)}{1 + (10^2)/(10^4)} = \\frac{135000}{1 + 0.01} = \\frac{135000}{1.01} \\approx 133663.37~\\mathrm{cm/s}$.\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.337 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{cm/s}$.\n\n2. For $E = 10^4~\\mathrm{V/cm}$:\n$v_d(10^4~\\mathrm{V/cm}) = \\frac{(1350)(10^4)}{1 + (10^4)/(10^4)} = \\frac{1.35 \\times 10^7}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1.35 \\times 10^7}{2} = 6.75 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{cm/s}$.\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $6.750 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{cm/s}$.\n\n3. For $E = 10^5~\\mathrm{V/cm}$:\n$v_d(10^5~\\mathrm{V/cm}) = \\frac{(1350)(10^5)}{1 + (10^5)/(10^4)} = \\frac{1.35 \\times 10^8}{1 + 10} = \\frac{1.35 \\times 10^8}{11} \\approx 1.22727 \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{cm/s}$.\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.227 \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{cm/s}$.\n\nInterpretation of the results:\n- At $E=10^2~\\mathrm{V/cm}$, which is much less than $E_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, the drift velocity is $1.337 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{cm/s}$. This value is only about $1\\%$ less than the low-field (Ohmic) prediction of $v_d = \\mu_n E = 1350 \\times 10^2 = 1.35 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{cm/s}$. This indicates the electron transport is in the linear, Ohmic regime.\n- At $E=10^4~\\mathrm{V/cm}$, which equals $E_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, the drift velocity is $6.750 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{cm/s}$. This is precisely half of the saturation velocity $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. This field strength marks the onset of significant deviation from linearity; the system is in the transition region where high-field scattering mechanisms become dominant.\n- At $E=10^5~\\mathrm{V/cm}$, which is much greater than $E_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, the drift velocity is $1.227 \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{cm/s}$. This value is approximately $91\\%$ of the saturation velocity $v_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 1.35 \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{cm/s}$. The velocity is clearly saturating, showing that a large increase in the electric field produces only a small increase in drift velocity. This is the velocity saturation regime, where energy gained from the field is efficiently dissipated by phonon emission, limiting the average velocity of the electrons.",

We can solve it by separation of variables:\n$$\\frac{dP}{P} = - \\frac{1}{\\lambda} dx$$\nIntegrating both sides from the source at $x=0$ to an arbitrary position $x$ gives:\n$$\\int_{P(0)}^{P(x)} \\frac{dP'}{P'} = \\int_0^x - \\frac{1}{\\lambda} dx'$$\nUsing the initial condition $P(0) = 1$, the integration yields:\n$$[\\ln(P')]_{1}^{P(x)} = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} [x']_0^x$$\n$$\\ln(P(x)) - \\ln(1) = -\\frac{x}{\\lambda}$$\nSince $\\ln(1)=0$, we have:\n$$\\ln(P(x)) = -\\frac{x}{\\lambda}$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the probability of a carrier traveling a distance $x$ without scattering:\n$$P(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nTo find the probability of a carrier traversing the entire channel of length $L$ without scattering, we evaluate this expression at $x=L$:\n$$P(L) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we evaluate this probability for the given values: channel length $L=20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and mean free path $\\lambda=15\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$P(L) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{15\\,\\mathrm{nm}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$P(L) \\approx 0.263597138...$$\nThe problem requires rounding this decimal fraction to four significant figures.\n$$P(L) \\approx 0.2636$$\n\nFinally, we are asked to discuss whether this result implies a quasi-ballistic regime. The calculated probability of approximately $0.2636$ signifies that about $26.4\\%$ of carriers are expected to traverse the entire $20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ channel without a single momentum-relaxing scattering event. Such transport, where a carrier's momentum is conserved throughout its transit, is termed ballistic. A regime where the channel length $L$ is comparable to the mean free path $\\lambda$ (i.e., $L/\\lambda \\sim 1$), and thus a significant fraction of carriers travel ballistically, is known as quasi-ballistic transport. In this case, $L/\\lambda = 20/15 = 4/3 \\approx 1.33$, which confirms the system is in the quasi-ballistic regime.\n\nVelocity saturation is a phenomenon characteristic of scattering-limited transport, where carriers undergo many scattering events ($L \\gg \\lambda$). In such a regime, an equilibrium is established between the energy gained from the electric field and the energy lost to the lattice via scattering. This leads to an average drift velocity that becomes independent of the field strength at high fields, i.e., it saturates at a value $v_{sat}$. This requires a statistically sufficient number of scattering events to define a stable, field-dependent carrier energy distribution and a corresponding average velocity.\n\nGiven that a substantial fraction ($26.4\\%$) of carriers do not scatter at all, they do not contribute to establishing this scattering-dominated equilibrium. Instead, these ballistic carriers continuously accelerate under the electric field. The remaining carriers will scatter, but since $L$ is only slightly larger than $\\lambda$, they will experience, on average, very few scattering events. This is insufficient to establish the steady-state conditions necessary for the carrier ensemble to reach a well-defined saturation velocity. Therefore, the high probability of ballistic transit indicates that the channel operates in a quasi-ballistic regime, where the concept of a field-limited saturation velocity, a bulk material property, is not fully applicable. The average carrier velocity will be position-dependent and will not have saturated to a constant value within the channel.",
