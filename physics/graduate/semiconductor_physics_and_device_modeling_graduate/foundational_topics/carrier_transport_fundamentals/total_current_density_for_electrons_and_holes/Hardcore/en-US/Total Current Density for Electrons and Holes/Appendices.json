A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation**\n\nThe current density, $\\vec{J}$, is defined as the charge density multiplied by the average drift velocity of the charge carriers. For electrons, the charge of a single carrier is $-q$ and the charge density is $-qn$. Their average drift velocity is $\\vec{v}_{dn}$. Therefore, the electron drift current density, $\\vec{J}_n$, which represents the contribution of electrons to the total current, is:\n$$\n\\vec{J}_n = (-qn) \\vec{v}_{dn}\n$$\nThe problem states a linear relationship between the average drift velocity and the electric field, which is the definition of mobility, $\\mu_n$. The force on an electron from the field $\\vec{E}$ causes it to drift with a velocity in the direction opposite to the field:\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{dn} = -\\mu_n \\vec{E}\n$$\nHere, $\\mu_n$ is the electron mobility, a positive scalar constant. Substituting this into the expression for $\\vec{J}_n$:\n$$\n\\vec{J}_n = (-qn) (-\\mu_n \\vec{E}) = qn\\mu_n \\vec{E}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the conventional current from electron drift flows in the same direction as the electric field. The magnitude of the current density, $J_n$, is therefore:\n$$\nJ_n = q n \\mu_n E\n$$\nThis is the required symbolic expression. It is a fundamental part of the drift-diffusion model.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.

            "problem": "A semi-infinite, uniformly doped $p$-type semiconductor occupies $x \\geq 0$. Under steady-state, one-dimensional (1D) transport with spatial variation only along $x$, an optically injected minority-electron concentration profile is established as $n(x)=n_{0}\\exp(-x/L_{n})$, where $n(x)$ is the electron concentration, $n_{0}0$ is the surface value at $x=0$, and $L_{n}$ is the electron diffusion length. The internal electric field is negligibly small throughout the region, and temperature is uniform so that the electron diffusion coefficient $D_{n}$ is spatially constant. Assume that conventional current is defined positive in the $+x$ direction, and that an electron carries charge $-q$ with $q0$ the elementary charge.\n\nStarting from the fundamental picture of diffusive transport driven by spatial concentration gradients and the definition of current density as charge flux, derive the steady-state electron diffusion current density $J_{n}^{\\text{diff}}(x)$ corresponding to the given profile. Express your final answer in amperes per square centimeter (A/cm$^{2}$) as a closed-form function of $x$. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the steady-state electron diffusion current density, $J_{n}^{\\text{diff}}(x)$, for a given minority-electron concentration profile in a semi-infinite $p$-type semiconductor. The derivation must start from fundamental principles.\n\nThe first principle is the description of diffusive transport, which is governed by Fick's first law. This law states that the particle flux, $\\Phi$, of a species is proportional to the negative of its concentration gradient. For one-dimensional electron transport along the $x$-axis, the electron particle flux, $\\Phi_{n}(x)$, is given by:\n$$\n\\Phi_{n}(x) = -D_{n} \\frac{dn(x)}{dx}\n$$\nIn this equation, $D_{n}$ is the electron diffusion coefficient, assumed to be a constant. The term $\\frac{dn(x)}{dx}$ represents the spatial gradient of the electron concentration, $n(x)$. The negative sign signifies that the net particle flow is directed from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration.\n\nThe second principle is the definition of electric current density, $J$, which is the rate of charge flow per unit area. It is related to the particle flux $\\Phi$ and the charge $Q$ of each particle by the relation $J = Q \\cdot \\Phi$. In this problem, the charge carriers are electrons, and each electron carries a charge of $-q$, where $q$ is the elementary positive charge. Therefore, the electron diffusion current density, $J_{n}^{\\text{diff}}(x)$, is obtained by multiplying the electron particle flux $\\Phi_{n}(x)$ by the charge of an electron:\n$$\nJ_{n}^{\\text{diff}}(x) = (-q) \\Phi_{n}(x)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Phi_{n}(x)$ from Fick's law into this equation gives the relationship between the electron diffusion current density and the electron concentration gradient:\n$$\nJ_{n}^{\\text{diff}}(x) = (-q) \\left(-D_{n} \\frac{dn(x)}{dx}\\right) = q D_{n} \\frac{dn(x)}{dx}\n$$\nThis equation is the cornerstone for solving the problem. Note the positive sign: the direction of electron conventional current is opposite to the direction of electron particle flow.\n\nThe problem specifies the minority-electron concentration profile as:\n$$\nn(x) = n_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{n}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $n_{0}$ is the concentration at the surface ($x=0$) and $L_{n}$ is the electron diffusion length. To find the current density, we must first calculate the gradient of this concentration profile with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{dn(x)}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ n_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{n}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the chain rule of differentiation, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{dn(x)}{dx} = n_{0} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{n}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{L_{n}}\\right) = -\\frac{n_{0}}{L_{n}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{n}}\\right)\n$$\nThe gradient is negative for all $x \\geq 0$, which is consistent with the physical picture that the electron concentration decreases as one moves deeper into the semiconductor from the surface of injection.\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for the gradient $\\frac{dn(x)}{dx}$ back into the equation for $J_{n}^{\\text{diff}}(x)$:\n$$\nJ_{n}^{\\text{diff}}(x) = q D_{n} \\left[ -\\frac{n_{0}}{L_{n}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{n}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final answer for the steady-state electron diffusion current density as a function of position $x$:\n$$\nJ_{n}^{\\text{diff}}(x) = -\\frac{q D_{n} n_{0}}{L_{n}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{n}}\\right)\n$$\nThe negative sign of $J_{n}^{\\text{diff}}(x)$ is physically correct. Since the electron concentration decreases with increasing $x$, electrons diffuse in the $+x$ direction. As electrons carry a negative charge, their movement in the $+x$ direction constitutes a conventional current in the $-x$ direction. Given that conventional current is defined as positive in the $+x$ direction, the derived current density must be negative. The derived expression is dimensionally consistent, yielding units of amperes per square centimeter ($\\text{A}/\\text{cm}^{2}$).",

This implies that not only is the total electrical current density $J(x) = J_n(x) + J_p(x)$ zero, but according to the principle of detailed balance, the individual electron and hole current densities must also be zero everywhere. Thus, for all $x$:\n$$\nJ_{n}(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad J_{p}(x) = 0\n$$\n\nWe can determine the required electric field $E(x)$ by applying this equilibrium condition to either the electron or the hole current equation.
