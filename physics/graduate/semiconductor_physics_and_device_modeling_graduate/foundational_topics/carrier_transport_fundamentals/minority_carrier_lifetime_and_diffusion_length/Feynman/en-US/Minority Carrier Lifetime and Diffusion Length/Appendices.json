            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the relation between the minority electron diffusion coefficient $D_{n}$ and the electron mobility $\\mu_{n}$ under specific conditions, followed by a numerical calculation and a qualitative analysis of temperature dependence.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation. The one-dimensional electron current density, $J_{n}$, is given by the sum of a drift component and a diffusion component:\n$$J_{n}(x) = qn(x)\\mu_{n}E(x) + qD_{n}\\frac{dn(x)}{dx}$$\nHere, $q$ is the magnitude of the elementary charge, $e$. So $q=e$. The electron concentration is $n(x)$, the electron mobility is $\\mu_{n}$, the electric field is $E(x)$, and the electron diffusion coefficient is $D_{n}$.\n\nA key premise is that the system is in quasi-equilibrium, characterized by a spatially constant electron quasi-Fermi level, $E_{Fn}$. The electron current density can be expressed more fundamentally in terms of the gradient of the quasi-Fermi level:\n$$J_{n}(x) = n(x)\\mu_{n}\\frac{dE_{Fn}(x)}{dx}$$\nSince $E_{Fn}$ is constant with respect to position $x$, its derivative is zero: $\\frac{dE_{Fn}(x)}{dx} = 0$. This immediately implies that the net electron current density is zero:\n$$J_{n}(x) = 0$$\nSetting the drift-diffusion equation to zero gives:\n$$qn(x)\\mu_{n}E(x) + qD_{n}\\frac{dn(x)}{dx} = 0$$\nDividing by $q$ (which is non-zero), we obtain a balance between the drift and diffusion fluxes:\n$$n(x)\\mu_{n}E(x) + D_{n}\\frac{dn(x)}{dx} = 0$$\n\nNext, we incorporate the remaining physical descriptions. The electric field $E(x)$ is the negative gradient of the electrostatic potential $\\psi(x)$:\n$$E(x) = -\\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx}$$\nThe minority electron concentration $n(x)$ in a non-degenerate semiconductor follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. It is related to the conduction band edge energy $E_{c}(x)$ and the constant electron quasi-Fermi level $E_{Fn}$ by:\n$$n(x) = N_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{c}(x) - E_{Fn}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nwhere $N_{c}$ is the effective density of states in the conduction band, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The conduction band edge energy varies with the electrostatic potential as $E_{c}(x) = E_{c,ref} - q\\psi(x)$, where $E_{c,ref}$ is a reference energy level. Substituting this into the expression for $n(x)$:\n$$n(x) = N_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{c,ref} - q\\psi(x) - E_{Fn}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nSince $N_{c}$, $E_{c,ref}$, $E_{Fn}$, $k_{B}$, and $T$ are all constant with respect to position $x$, we can differentiate $n(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{dn(x)}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ N_{c} \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\psi(x) - E_{c,ref} + E_{Fn}}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dn(x)}{dx} = \\left[ N_{c} \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\psi(x) - E_{c,ref} + E_{Fn}}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\right] \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{q\\psi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nThe term in the square brackets is simply $n(x)$. Therefore:\n$$\\frac{dn(x)}{dx} = n(x) \\frac{q}{k_{B}T} \\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $E(x)$ and $\\frac{dn(x)}{dx}$ into the zero-current balance equation:\n$$n(x)\\mu_{n}\\left(-\\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx}\\right) + D_{n}\\left(n(x) \\frac{q}{k_{B}T} \\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx}\\right) = 0$$\nFor any non-trivial case where there is an electric field, we have $n(x) \\neq 0$ and $\\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx} \\neq 0$. We can therefore divide the entire equation by $n(x)\\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx}$:\n$$-\\mu_{n} + D_{n}\\frac{q}{k_{B}T} = 0$$\nRearranging this equation yields the desired relationship, known as the Einstein relation:\n$$D_{n} = \\mu_{n} \\frac{k_{B}T}{q}$$\n\nSecond, we perform the numerical calculation for $D_{n}$.\nThe given values are:\nElectron mobility $\\mu_{n} = 1350\\ \\mathrm{cm^2/(V\\ s)}$\nTemperature $T = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$\nThe physical constants are:\nBoltzmann constant $k_{B} \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$\nElementary charge magnitude $q = e \\approx 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$\n\nThe term $\\frac{k_{B}T}{q}$ is the thermal voltage, $V_{th}$. Let's calculate its value:\n$$V_{th} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K})(300\\ \\mathrm{K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nNote that the units become Volts since $1\\ \\mathrm{J/C} = 1\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\nNow, we compute the diffusion coefficient $D_{n}$:\n$$D_{n} = \\mu_{n} V_{th} = (1350\\ \\mathrm{cm^2/(V\\ s)}) \\times (0.025852045...\\ \\mathrm{V})$$\n$$D_{n} \\approx 34.90026\\ \\mathrm{cm^2/s}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$D_{n} \\approx 34.90\\ \\mathrm{cm^2/s}$$\n\nFinally, we provide the qualitative comment on the temperature sensitivity of $D_{n}$.\nThe derived Einstein relation is $D_{n}(T) = \\mu_{n}(T) \\frac{k_{B}T}{q}$. This shows that the diffusion coefficient's temperature dependence is a product of the mobility's temperature dependence, $\\mu_{n}(T)$, and a linear dependence on temperature, $T$. The problem specifies that mobility is dominated by phonon scattering. In silicon near room temperature ($300\\ \\mathrm{K}$), lattice (phonon) scattering is the primary mechanism limiting carrier mobility. The theoretical model for this scattering mechanism predicts a temperature dependence of the form $\\mu_{n}(T) \\propto T^{-3/2}$.\nCombining these dependencies, the overall temperature dependence of $D_{n}$ is:\n$$D_{n}(T) \\propto \\mu_{n}(T) \\cdot T \\propto (T^{-3/2}) \\cdot (T^{1}) = T^{-1/2}$$\nThus, $D_{n}$ is proportional to $T^{-1/2}$. This indicates that the diffusion coefficient for minority electrons is expected to *decrease* as temperature increases around $300\\ \\mathrm{K}$. The strong inverse dependence of mobility on temperature more than compensates for the linear increase in thermal energy.",

The analysis is for a region free of volumetric generation (e.g., optical generation). The term $(R_n - G_n)$ represents the net recombination rate. In steady state and under low-level injection, the net recombination rate of excess carriers is given by $\\frac{\\Delta n(x)}{\\tau_n}$, where $\\Delta n(x) = n(x) - n_0$ is the excess minority electron concentration ($n_0$ being the constant equilibrium concentration in the uniformly doped wafer) and $\\tau_n$ is the constant effective electron lifetime.\n\nApplying these conditions simplifies the continuity equation to:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{d J_n(x)}{d x} - \\frac{\\Delta n(x)}{\\tau_n}\n$$\n\nNext, we model the electron current density $J_n$.

This leaves only the diffusion component (Fick's law):\n$$\nJ_n(x) \\approx q D_n \\frac{d n(x)}{d x}\n$$\nThe electron concentration is $n(x) = n_0 + \\Delta n(x)$. Since the wafer is uniformly doped, the equilibrium concentration $n_0$ is a constant, independent of position $x$. Therefore, the gradient of the total electron concentration is equal to the gradient of the excess electron concentration:\n$$\n\\frac{d n(x)}{d x} = \\frac{d}{d x} (n_0 + \\Delta n(x)) = \\frac{d \\Delta n(x)}{d x}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $J_n$ gives:\n$$\nJ_n(x) = q D_n \\frac{d \\Delta n(x)}{d x}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $J_n(x)$ back into the simplified steady-state continuity equation:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{d}{d x} \\left( q D_n \\frac{d \\Delta n(x)}{d x} \\right) - \\frac{\\Delta n(x)}{\\tau_n}\n$$\nThe problem states that the diffusion coefficient $D_n$ is constant, so it can be moved outside the derivative:\n$$\n0 = D_n \\frac{d^2 \\Delta n(x)}{d x^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n(x)}{\\tau_n}\n$$\nRearranging this gives the spatial differential equation governing the excess minority electron concentration:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\Delta n(x)}{d x^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n(x)}{D_n \\tau_n} = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.

A substantial fraction of electrons will recombine in the bulk, but a non-negligible fraction will also be able to reach the far surface. Therefore, a precise model of this wafer would need to account for both bulk recombination and the boundary condition at the far surface, rather than relying on the simplifying assumptions associated with either a very thick or a very thin device.\nThe numerical value requested for the final answer is the characteristic length in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, rounded to $4$ significant figures.",
