It presents a standard, simplified model for high-field carrier transport and velocity saturation in semiconductors, which is a fundamental topic in solid-state physics and microelectronics. The concepts employed—work-energy theorem, phonon scattering, energy relaxation length, and steady-state balance—are well-established scientific principles. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary definitions ($\\lambda_{E}$), constants ($\\hbar\\omega_{op}$), and a clear objective. The language is precise, formal, and free of any subjective or non-scientific assertions. The numerical data provided for silicon are physically realistic. The problem does not exhibit any of the flaws that would render it invalid, such as scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, or missing information.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution is provided below.\n\n**Derivation of the Criterion and Saturation Field**\nThe derivation begins with the work-energy theorem applied to an electron in the semiconductor. In a steady state of high-field transport, the average rate at which an electron gains energy from the electric field must be exactly balanced by the average rate at which it loses energy to the crystal lattice. The problem provides a framework for this balance through the definition of the energy relaxation length, $\\lambda_{E}$.\n\nLet us consider an electron with charge $e$ moving under the influence of a uniform electric field $E$. According to the work-energy theorem, the work done on the electron by the electrostatic force as it travels a distance $\\lambda_E$ parallel to the field is:\n$$ \\Delta W_{\\text{gain}} = F \\cdot d = (eE) \\lambda_{E} $$\nThis quantity represents the energy gained by the electron from the field over this characteristic length.\n\nThe problem defines $\\lambda_E$ as the characteristic distance over which the electron ensemble dissipates an energy of approximately $\\hbar\\omega_{op}$ to the lattice. The dominant mechanism for this energy loss at high fields is specified to be the emission of optical phonons. Therefore, the energy lost by an electron over the distance $\\lambda_{E}$ is:\n$$ \\Delta W_{\\text{loss}} = \\hbar\\omega_{op} $$\n\nVelocity saturation is a quintessential steady-state phenomenon. The onset of this regime can be modeled by the condition where the energy gained from the field over the characteristic dissipation length is precisely equal to the quantum of energy dissipated in a dominant scattering event. This establishes a stable cycle of energy gain and loss, preventing the average carrier drift velocity from increasing further with the field. Equating the energy gain and loss provides the minimal criterion for the onset of saturation:\n$$ e E \\lambda_{E} = \\hbar\\omega_{op} $$\nThis equation represents the fundamental balance that governs high-field transport in this model, providing the requested criterion in terms of $E$, $\\lambda_{E}$, and $\\hbar\\omega_{op}$.\n\nTo obtain a closed-form expression for the saturation field, $E_{sat}$, we solve this criterion for the electric field $E$. The field that satisfies this balance is, by definition, the characteristic field associated with the onset of saturation.\n$$ E_{sat} = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_{op}}{e \\lambda_{E}} $$\nThis is the required expression for the saturation field.\n\n**Physical Assumptions**\nThis derivation is based on a simplified physical model and relies upon several key assumptions:\n$1$. **Steady-State Condition**: The derivation assumes a non-equilibrium steady state where the time-averaged energy of the electron distribution is constant. This implies that the rate of energy gain from the field is perfectly balanced by the rate of energy loss to the lattice.\n$2$. **Dominance of Optical Phonon Scattering**: It is assumed that at the high fields necessary for velocity saturation, the primary mechanism for energy relaxation is the emission of optical phonons. Other scattering mechanisms, such as those involving acoustic phonons or impurities, are considered to have a negligible contribution to energy loss.\n$3$. **Semi-Classical Approximation**: The model is semi-classical. The electron's motion and energy gain from the continuous electric field are treated classically, whereas the energy loss mechanism is treated quantum mechanically, involving discrete energy quanta $\\hbar\\omega_{op}$.\n$4$. **Hot Carrier Regime**: The model implicitly assumes that the electrons are \"hot,\" meaning their average kinetic energy, acquired from the field, is significantly greater than the thermal energy of the lattice, $k_B T$. This is consistent with the conditions for significant optical phonon emission, as typically $\\hbar\\omega_{op} > k_B T$ at room temperature.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation for Silicon**\nWe are asked to calculate the value of $E_{sat}$ for silicon at $T = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$, using the provided data: $\\hbar\\omega_{op} = 0.063\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\lambda_{E} = 50\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\nThe expression for the saturation field is:\n$$ E_{sat} = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_{op}}{e \\lambda_{E}} $$\nThe term $\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_{op}}{e}$ can be directly evaluated. Since $\\hbar\\omega_{op}$ is given in units of electron-volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$), dividing by the elementary charge $e$ yields a value in volts ($\\mathrm{V}$):\n$$ \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_{op}}{e} = \\frac{0.063\\ \\mathrm{eV}}{e} = 0.063\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nThe given energy relaxation length is $\\lambda_{E} = 50\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $E_{sat}$:\n$$ E_{sat} = \\frac{0.063\\ \\mathrm{V}}{50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 0.00126 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{V/m} = 1.26 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{V/m} $$\nThe final answer must be in units of $\\mathrm{kV/cm}$. We perform the unit conversion as follows, using the identities $1\\ \\mathrm{kV} = 10^3\\ \\mathrm{V}$ and $1\\ \\mathrm{cm} = 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n$$ E_{sat} = 1.26 \\times 10^6\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{m}} = 1.26 \\times 10^6\\ \\frac{10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kV}}{10^2\\ \\mathrm{cm}} = 1.26 \\times 10^6 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kV}}{\\mathrm{cm}} $$\n$$ E_{sat} = 1.26 \\times 10^1\\ \\mathrm{kV/cm} = 12.6\\ \\mathrm{kV/cm} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ E_{sat} = 12.60\\ \\mathrm{kV/cm} $$",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Field-Dependent Mobility and Drift Velocity**\n\nIn the semiclassical model under the relaxation-time approximation, the steady-state average velocity, or drift velocity $v_d$, is determined by the balance between the acceleration from the electric field $E$ and the deceleration from scattering events, characterized by the momentum relaxation time $\\tau_{m}$. The average momentum gained from the field between collisions is $qE\\tau_{m}(E)$. Equating this to the change in momentum $m^{\\ast}v_d$, we have:\n$$\nm^{\\ast}v_{d}(E) = qE\\tau_{m}(E)\n$$\nThis gives the drift velocity as a function of the field:\n$$\nv_{d}(E) = \\frac{q\\tau_{m}(E)}{m^{\\ast}} E\n$$\nThe field-dependent mobility $\\mu(E)$ is defined by the relation $v_d(E) = \\mu(E) E$. Comparing this with the expression above, we identify the mobility as:\n$$\n\\mu(E) = \\frac{q\\tau_{m}(E)}{m^{\\ast}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given empirical form for $\\tau_{m}(E)$:\n$$\n\\mu(E) = \\frac{q}{m^{\\ast}} \\left( \\frac{\\tau_{0}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{E}{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{\\beta}} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the definition of the low-field mobility, $\\mu_{0} = q\\tau_{0}/m^{\\ast}$, we obtain the expression for the field-dependent mobility:\n$$\n\\mu(E) = \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{E}{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{\\beta}}\n$$\nConsequently, the drift velocity is:\n$$\nv_{d}(E) = \\mu(E)E = \\frac{\\mu_{0}E}{1 + \\left(\\frac{E}{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{\\beta}}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Asymptotic Behavior and Monotonicity**\n\nThe dimensionless drift velocity is defined as $\\hat{v}(E) = v_{d}(E)/(\\mu_{0} E_{\\mathrm{ref}})$. Substituting the result from Part 1:\n$$\n\\hat{v}(E) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}E_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{0}E}{1 + \\left(\\frac{E}{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{\\beta}} \\right) = \\frac{E/E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{E}{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{\\beta}}\n$$\nLet us define a dimensionless electric field $\\hat{E} = E/E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. The dimensionless velocity is then a function of $\\hat{E}$:\n$$\n\\hat{v}(\\hat{E}) = \\frac{\\hat{E}}{1 + \\hat{E}^{\\beta}}\n$$\nTo determine the large-field asymptotic behavior, we take the limit as $\\hat{E} \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\hat{E}\\to\\infty} \\hat{v}(\\hat{E}) = \\lim_{\\hat{E}\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{E}}{1 + \\hat{E}^{\\beta}} \\sim \\lim_{\\hat{E}\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{E}}{\\hat{E}^{\\beta}} = \\lim_{\\hat{E}\\to\\infty} \\hat{E}^{1-\\beta}\n$$\nThe behavior depends on the value of $\\beta$:\n- If $0  \\beta  1$, the exponent $1-\\beta  0$, so $\\hat{v}(E) \\to \\infty$. The velocity does not saturate.\n- If $\\beta = 1$, the exponent $1-\\beta = 0$, so $\\hat{v}(E) \\to 1$. The velocity saturates to a finite, non-zero constant value $v_{d,sat} = \\mu_0 E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n- If $\\beta  1$, the exponent $1-\\beta  0$, so $\\hat{v}(E) \\to 0$. The velocity exhibits a peak and then decreases, a phenomenon known as negative differential resistance.\n\n\"True saturation\" to a finite, non-zero constant occurs specifically for $\\beta=1$.\n\nTo analyze monotonicity, we compute the derivative of $\\hat{v}$ with respect to $\\hat{E}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{v}}{d\\hat{E}} = \\frac{d}{d\\hat{E}} \\left( \\frac{\\hat{E}}{1 + \\hat{E}^{\\beta}} \\right) = \\frac{(1)(1 + \\hat{E}^{\\beta}) - \\hat{E}(\\beta \\hat{E}^{\\beta-1})}{(1 + \\hat{E}^{\\beta})^2} = \\frac{1 + \\hat{E}^{\\beta} - \\beta \\hat{E}^{\\beta}}{(1 + \\hat{E}^{\\beta})^2} = \\frac{1 - (\\beta-1)\\hat{E}^{\\beta}}{(1 + \\hat{E}^{\\beta})^2}\n$$\nAn extremum exists if the derivative can be zero for $\\hat{E}  0$. This requires the numerator to be zero:\n$$\n1 - (\\beta-1)\\hat{E}^{\\beta} = 0 \\implies (\\beta-1)\\hat{E}^{\\beta} = 1\n$$\nFor a real, positive solution for $\\hat{E}$, we must have $\\beta-1  0$, which means $\\beta  1$. In this case, there is a peak velocity. If $\\beta \\le 1$, the term $\\beta-1 \\le 0$, making the numerator $1 - (\\beta-1)\\hat{E}^{\\beta}$ always positive for $\\hat{E}  0$. Thus, $d\\hat{v}/d\\hat{E}  0$ for all $\\hat{E}$, and the velocity is monotonically increasing for $\\beta \\le 1$.\n\n**Part 3: Peak Velocity for $\\beta  1$**\n\nFor $\\beta  1$, a peak velocity exists. The dimensionless field $\\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ at which this peak occurs is found by solving the condition from Part 2:\n$$\n(\\beta-1)\\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}}^{\\beta} = 1 \\implies \\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}}^{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{\\beta-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\beta-1}\\right)^{1/\\beta} = (\\beta-1)^{-1/\\beta}\n$$\nThe dimensionless peak velocity $\\hat{v}_{\\max}$ is found by substituting $\\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ back into the expression for $\\hat{v}(\\hat{E})$:\n$$\n\\hat{v}_{\\max} = \\hat{v}(\\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}}) = \\frac{\\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}}}{1 + \\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}}^{\\beta}}\n$$\nWe substitute the value of $\\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}}^{\\beta}$:\n$$\n\\hat{v}_{\\max} = \\frac{\\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}}}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\beta-1}} = \\frac{\\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}}}{\\frac{\\beta-1+1}{\\beta-1}} = \\frac{\\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}}}{\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta-1}} = \\left(\\frac{\\beta-1}{\\beta}\\right)\\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}}\n$$\nNow, substituting the expression for $\\hat{E}_{\\mathrm{peak}}$:\n$$\n\\hat{v}_{\\max} = \\left(\\frac{\\beta-1}{\\beta}\\right) (\\beta-1)^{-1/\\beta} = \\frac{(\\beta-1)^{1}}{ \\beta} (\\beta-1)^{-1/\\beta} = \\frac{(\\beta-1)^{1 - 1/\\beta}}{\\beta} = \\frac{(\\beta-1)^{(\\beta-1)/\\beta}}{\\beta}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the dimensionless peak velocity.\n\n**Part 4: Locality, Non-locality, and Velocity Overshoot**\n\n1.  **Local Mobility Model**: The model used in Parts 1-3, $v_{d}(E) = \\mu(E)E$, is a *local* model. This means the drift velocity $v_d$ at a spatial point $x$ is determined exclusively by the electric field $E$ at that same point $x$. Physically, this model implicitly assumes that the carrier ensemble (specifically, its average energy and momentum) is always in instantaneous equilibrium with the local electric field. When a carrier moves from a low-field region to a high-field region, this model assumes its average energy and scattering rate instantaneously adjust to the new, higher field. Consequently, its mobility immediately drops to the low value corresponding to the high field, preventing the velocity from exceeding the steady-state saturation value $v_{sat}(E_{high})$. The velocity simply traces the static $v_d$-$E$ curve. Therefore, such a model cannot, by its very structure, describe the phenomenon of *spatial* velocity overshoot, where $v_d(x)$ can transiently exceed $v_{sat}(E(x))$.\n\n2.  **Hydrodynamic (Two-Moment) Description**: A hydrodynamic model provides a more sophisticated, *non-local* description. It is derived by taking moments of the BTE, resulting in a set of coupled conservation laws for carrier density $n$, average momentum $\\mathbf{p} = m^{\\ast}\\mathbf{v}_d$, and average energy $W$. The simplified, time-dependent rate equations for momentum and energy illustrate the core physics:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(m^{\\ast}v_d)}{dt} = qE - \\frac{m^{\\ast}v_d}{\\tau_{m}(W)} \\quad \\text{(Momentum Balance)}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{dW}{dt} = qE v_d - \\frac{W - W_{0}}{\\tau_{e}} \\quad \\text{(Energy Balance)}\n    $$\n    Here, $W_0$ is the thermal equilibrium energy and $\\tau_{e}$ is the energy relaxation time. The crucial feature is that the momentum relaxation time $\\tau_{m}$ is a function of the average carrier energy $W$, not directly of the local field $E$. The energy $W$ itself has its own dynamics, evolving over a characteristic time $\\tau_e$.\n\n    **Explanation of Overshoot**: Consider carriers flowing from a low-field region into a region where the field rises sharply to a high value $E_{0}$.\n    - Initially, carriers have low energy $W \\approx W_{0}$, so their momentum relaxation time $\\tau_m(W)$ is large (i.e., scattering is weak).\n    - Upon entering the high-field region, the term $qE_{0}$ in the momentum balance equation provides a strong accelerating force. Since $\\tau_m$ is still large, the resistive term is small, and the velocity $v_d$ increases rapidly.\n    - The energy $W$ also begins to increase via the $qEv_d$ heating term in the energy balance equation. However, this process is not instantaneous; it is delayed by the finite energy relaxation time $\\tau_e$.\n    - During this delay, for a short time and distance, the carriers are simultaneously exposed to a high field $E_0$ and possess a low energy $W$. This combination of high driving force and low scattering rate allows their velocity to accelerate to a value that can exceed the steady-state saturation velocity $v_{sat}$, which corresponds to the equilibrium state where carriers have high energy $W_{high}$ and thus a small $\\tau_m(W_{high})$.\n    - As the carriers continue to travel through the high-field region, their energy $W$ eventually catches up, $\\tau_m(W)$ decreases, and the velocity relaxes back down to the lower steady-state value $v_{sat}$.\n    This transient, non-local effect, where velocity peaks before energy equilibrates, is velocity overshoot. It is fundamentally a non-equilibrium, non-local phenomenon that can only be captured by models like the hydrodynamic equations that separate the dynamics of momentum and energy via finite relaxation times ($\\tau_m$ and $\\tau_e$). A local model where $\\tau_e \\to 0$ cannot exhibit this behavior.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe total drift current, $I$, flowing through a cross-sectional area, $A$, is given by the integral of the current density, $J$, over that area:\n$$\nI = \\int_{A} J \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nThe current density is defined as $J = q n v$, where $q$ is the elementary charge, $n$ is the volume density of mobile carriers, and $v$ is their drift velocity. Substituting this into the current equation gives:\n$$\nI = \\int_{A} q n v \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nIn a FinFET, the current flows in a thin inversion layer formed along the gated surfaces (top and sidewalls of the fin). The total perimeter of these gated surfaces constitutes the effective width, $W_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Let the direction of current flow be $z$. The cross-sectional area $A$ is perpendicular to this flow and consists of a very thin sheet of thickness $t_{\\mathrm{inv}}$ wrapped along the perimeter $W_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. We can decompose the area integral as an integral along the effective width and an integral through the thickness of the inversion layer.\n$$\nI = \\int_{0}^{W_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\left( \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{inv}}} q n(x,w) v(x,w) \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\right) \\mathrm{d}w\n$$\nHere, $w$ is the coordinate along the effective width and $x$ is the coordinate normal to the surface, into the semiconductor.\n\nThe problem states that the device operates in the saturation region where the carrier velocity is assumed to be constant and equal to the saturation velocity, $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. It also assumes a uniform inversion sheet density along the gated surfaces. The sheet carrier density, $n_s$, is defined as the integral of the volume density, $n$, through the depth of the inversion layer:\n$$\nn_s = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{inv}}} n(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nSince $q$, $v=v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, and $n_s$ are assumed to be uniform along the effective width $W_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we can simplify the current integral:\n$$\nI = \\int_{0}^{W_{\\mathrm{eff}}} q v_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\left( \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{inv}}} n(x,w) \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\right) \\mathrm{d}w = \\int_{0}^{W_{\\mathrm{eff}}} q v_{\\mathrm{sat}} n_s \\, \\mathrm{d}w\n$$\nAs $q$, $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, and $n_s$ are constants, they can be taken outside the final integral:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{sat}} = q n_s v_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\int_{0}^{W_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\mathrm{d}w\n$$\nThe integral of $\\mathrm{d}w$ over the effective width is simply $W_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. This yields the desired expression for the saturation-velocity-limited current:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{sat}} = q n_s v_{\\mathrm{sat}} W_{\\mathrm{eff}}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value. The given parameters are:\n- $q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}~\\text{C}$\n- $n_s = 1 \\times 10^{13}~\\text{cm}^{-2}$\n- $v_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 1 \\times 10^{7}~\\text{cm/s}$\n- $W_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 96~\\text{nm}$\n\nTo ensure consistency, all units must be converted to the SI system (meters, Coulombs, seconds).\n- $q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}~\\text{C}$\n- $n_s = 1 \\times 10^{13}~\\text{cm}^{-2} = 1 \\times 10^{13} \\times (10^{-2}~\\text{m})^{-2} = 1 \\times 10^{13} \\times 10^{4}~\\text{m}^{-2} = 1 \\times 10^{17}~\\text{m}^{-2}$\n- $v_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 1 \\times 10^{7}~\\text{cm/s} = 1 \\times 10^{7} \\times 10^{-2}~\\text{m/s} = 1 \\times 10^{5}~\\text{m/s}$\n- $W_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 96~\\text{nm} = 96 \\times 10^{-9}~\\text{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{sat}} = (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}~\\text{C}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{17}~\\text{m}^{-2}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{5}~\\text{m/s}) \\times (96 \\times 10^{-9}~\\text{m})\n$$\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{sat}} = (1.602 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 96) \\times (10^{-19} \\times 10^{17} \\times 10^{5} \\times 10^{-9})~\\text{A}\n$$\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 153.792 \\times 10^{-19+17+5-9}~\\text{A}\n$$\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 153.792 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{A}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in microamperes ($1~\\mu\\text{A} = 10^{-6}~\\text{A}$).\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 153.792~\\mu\\text{A}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\approx 154~\\mu\\text{A}\n$$\n\n### Justification for Velocity Overshoot\nThe model above assumes that the carrier velocity is limited by the steady-state saturation velocity, $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. This velocity is the result of a balance between the acceleration of carriers by the electric field and the deceleration due to scattering events (primarily with optical phonons) that relax the carrier energy. This steady-state model is accurate for long-channel devices where carriers undergo numerous scattering events while traversing the high-field region.\n\nHowever, in modern short-channel devices such as the FinFET described, the high-field region near the drain can be extremely short, potentially shorter than the mean free path for energy-relaxing collisions. When carriers enter this region, they are rapidly accelerated by the high electric field. Before they have had sufficient time and distance to scatter and lose energy to the lattice, their average velocity can transiently exceed the steady-state saturation velocity, $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. This phenomenon is called **velocity overshoot**.\n\nSince the drain current is directly proportional to the carrier velocity ($I_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\propto v$), if the effective carrier velocity is greater than $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ due to overshoot, the actual drain current will be higher than the value predicted by the simple saturation-velocity-limited model. Therefore, the calculated value of $154~\\mu\\text{A}$ should be considered a lower-bound estimate, and the real-world device current would be somewhat larger.",
