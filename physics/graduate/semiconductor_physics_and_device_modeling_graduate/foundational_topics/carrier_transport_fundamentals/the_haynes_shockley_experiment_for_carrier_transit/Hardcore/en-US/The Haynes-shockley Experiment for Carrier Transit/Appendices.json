            "introduction": "While the Green's function describes the ideal evolution of the carrier packet, a real experiment provides a time-dependent current signal at a collector. A key challenge is that the observed peak signal amplitude diminishes for two distinct reasons: diffusive spreading, which broadens the packet, and recombination, which reduces the total number of carriers. This exercise  presents a critical hands-on data analysis problem: how to disentangle these two effects. By exploring the scaling of the peak current versus the total collected charge, you will learn a powerful normalization technique used to isolate the impact of diffusion, a method vital for accurately extracting the diffusion coefficient from experimental data.",

            "problem": "A packet of minority carriers is injected by a short pulse at position $x=0$ and time $t=0$ in a long, uniformly biased semiconductor bar used in the Haynes-Shockley (HS) experiment. The bar has cross-sectional area $A$, uniform electric field $E$, minority-carrier mobility $\\mu$, diffusion coefficient $D$, and bulk lifetime $\\tau$. The packet is sufficiently localized in space and time that its initial profile may be approximated as a scaled Dirac delta in $x$ and a delta in $t$. A collecting electrode at position $x=L$ records a transient signal $I(t)$ that is proportional to the local minority-carrier arrival and is modeled, under the Ramo-Shockley theorem (RST) with approximately uniform weighting near the collector, by $I(t)=K\\,n(L,t)$, where $K$ is a geometry- and bias-dependent constant and $n(x,t)$ is the minority-carrier density.\n\nThe observed peak height $I_{\\mathrm{pk}}=\\max_{t>0} I(t)$ decreases with increasing $L$ due to both bulk recombination (fewer carriers survive to reach the collector) and diffusive spreading in time (broader $I(t)$ reduces the peak height even if the total number of collected carriers were unchanged).

Normalize the peak amplitude by the time-integrated collected charge, i.e., use $I_{\\mathrm{pk}}/Q_{\\mathrm{coll}}$, which cancels the exponential survival factor and the unknown scale factor $K$ and $N_{0}$, leaving a shape parameter controlled by $D$ and $v_{d}$.\n\nB.

            "solution": "The problem asks to identify a method for normalizing the measured peak current, $I_{\\mathrm{pk}}$, in a Haynes-Shockley experiment to separate the effects of bulk recombination from diffusive spreading. The normalization should be independent of the unknown carrier injection magnitude and the minority carrier lifetime, $\\tau$.\n\nFirst, we must solve the one-dimensional drift-diffusion-recombination continuity equation for the minority-carrier density $n(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}n}{\\partial x^{2}} - v_{d}\\,\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x} - \\frac{n}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe initial condition is a delta function pulse at $x=0, t=0$, representing the injection of a total of $N_{inj} = A N_0$ carriers, where $A$ is the cross-sectional area and $N_0$ is the injected number of carriers per unit area. So, $n(x, t=0) = N_0 \\delta(x)$.\n\nThe solution to this partial differential equation (PDE) can be found using a series of transformations. First, we remove the recombination term by letting $n(x,t) = m(x,t) e^{-t/\\tau}$. Substituting this into the PDE yields the standard drift-diffusion equation for $m(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial t} = D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}m}{\\partial x^{2}} - v_{d}\\,\\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThe initial condition for $m$ is $m(x,0) = n(x,0) e^0 = N_0\\delta(x)$. The solution to this equation is a Gaussian packet that drifts with velocity $v_d$ and spreads with diffusion coefficient $D$:\n$$\nm(x,t) = \\frac{N_0}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - v_d t)^2}{4Dt}\\right)\n$$\nTransforming back to $n(x,t)$, we get the full solution:\n$$\nn(x,t) = \\frac{N_0}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - v_d t)^2}{4Dt}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nThe measured current at the collector at position $x=L$ is given as $I(t) = K\\,n(L,t)$, where $K$ is a proportionality constant.\n$$\nI(t) = K \\frac{N_0}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(L - v_d t)^2}{4Dt}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the asymptotic regime $D/(v_{d}L)\\ll 1$, which corresponds to drift dominating over diffusion. In this limit, the carrier packet remains relatively narrow, and the arrival time of the peak of the packet at $x=L$ is very close to the pure drift time, $t_d = L/v_d$. We can therefore approximate the peak of the signal $I_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ by evaluating $I(t)$ at $t=t_d$.\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\approx I(t_d) = K n(L, t_d) = K \\frac{N_0}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D t_d}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(L - v_d t_d)^2}{4Dt_d}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_d}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $t_d = L/v_d$, the term $(L - v_d t_d)^2$ becomes zero. The expression for the peak current simplifies to:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\approx K \\frac{N_0}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D (L/v_d)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{v_d \\tau}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression shows two distinct sources of peak height decay with distance $L$:\n1.  **Bulk Recombination:** The term $\\exp(-L/(v_d \\tau))$ represents the fraction of carriers that survive the transit time $t_d=L/v_d$ without recombining.\n2.  **Diffusive Spreading:** The term $1/\\sqrt{4\\pi D (L/v_d)} \\propto L^{-1/2}$ shows that as the packet travels further, it has more time to spread out, reducing its peak concentration even if all carriers were conserved.\n\nNext, we evaluate the time-integrated collected charge, $Q_{\\mathrm{coll}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$.\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{coll}} = K \\int_{0}^{\\infty} n(L,t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nThis integral can be evaluated rigorously by solving the time-integrated version of the continuity equation. Let $N(x) = \\int_0^\\infty n(x,t) dt$. Integrating the PDE with respect to time from $0$ to $\\infty$ yields an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $N(x)$:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 N}{d x^2} - v_d \\frac{d N}{d x} - \\frac{N}{\\tau} = -N_0 \\delta(x)\n$$\nIn the drift-dominated limit (small $D$), the solution for $x>0$ is well-approximated by:\n$$\nN(x) \\approx \\frac{N_0}{v_d} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{v_d \\tau}\\right)\n$$\n(This can be seen by neglecting the $D N''$ term, which gives a first-order ODE, or by expanding the full solution for the ODE in the limit of small $D$).\nThus, the total collected charge is:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{coll}} = K N(L) \\approx K \\frac{N_0}{v_d} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{v_d \\tau}\\right)\n$$\nNotice that $Q_{\\mathrm{coll}}$ is proportional to the total number of carriers that survive the transit to $x=L$. It is not affected by the temporal spreading (diffusion) of the packet at the collector, only by the total number that arrive.\n\nWith these derived expressions for $I_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ and $Q_{\\mathrm{coll}}$, we can now evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Normalize the peak amplitude by the time-integrated collected charge, i.e., use $I_{\\mathrm{pk}}/Q_{\\mathrm{coll}}$.**\nWe form the ratio using our derived expressions:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{coll}}} \\approx \\frac{K \\frac{N_0}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D L/v_d}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{v_d \\tau}\\right)}{K \\frac{N_0}{v_d} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{v_d \\tau}\\right)}\n$$\nThe unknown injection-related factor $K N_0$ cancels out. The exponential recombination factor $\\exp(-L/(v_d \\tau))$ also cancels. We are left with:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{coll}}} \\approx \\frac{1/\\sqrt{4\\pi D L/v_d}}{1/v_d} = \\frac{v_d}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D L / v_d}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{v_d^3}{4\\pi D L}}\n$$\nThis resulting quantity is independent of the unknown injection magnitude ($N_0$) and the lifetime ($\\tau$), as required. Its dependence on $L$ (specifically, $\\propto L^{-1/2}$) is entirely due to diffusive spreading. This normalization therefore successfully isolates the effect of diffusive spreading from recombination-induced decay. The procedure itself (measuring $I_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ and $Q_{\\mathrm{coll}}$ from the signal and taking their ratio) does not require prior knowledge of any parameters.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Normalize the peak amplitude by the temporal standard deviation of the transient, i.e., use $I_{\\mathrm{pk}}\\,\\sigma_{t}$.**\nThe temporal standard deviation of the Gaussian arrival pulse is $\\sigma_t^2 \\approx 2Dt_d/v_d^2 = 2DL/v_d^3$, so $\\sigma_t = \\sqrt{2DL/v_d^3}$.\nLet's compute the product $I_{\\mathrm{pk}}\\,\\sigma_{t}$:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{pk}}\\,\\sigma_{t} \\approx \\left( K \\frac{N_0}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D L/v_d}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{v_d \\tau}\\right) \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2DL}{v_d^3}} \\right) = \\frac{K N_0}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} v_d} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{v_d \\tau}\\right)\n$$\nThis product is not constant in $L$; it decays exponentially due to recombination. The claim that this quantity is constant in $L$ when recombination is present is false. Thus, this normalization does not remove the effect of recombination.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Use the first moment of the transient to remove recombination, i.e., replace $I_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ by $I_{\\mathrm{pk}}/\\int_{0}^{\\infty}t\\,I(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$.**\nThe denominator is the first temporal moment of the current. It is related to the mean arrival time $\\bar{t}$ by $\\int t\\,I(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\bar{t} \\, Q_{\\mathrm{coll}}$. In our approximation, $\\bar{t} \\approx t_d = L/v_d$. So, the denominator is approximately:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty}t\\,I(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t \\approx \\frac{L}{v_d} Q_{\\mathrm{coll}} \\approx \\frac{L}{v_d} \\left( K \\frac{N_0}{v_d} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{v_d \\tau}\\right) \\right) = K \\frac{N_0 L}{v_d^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{v_d \\tau}\\right)\n$$\nThe assertion that this factor is \"insensitive to recombination\" is false; it clearly contains the exponential decay term. The normalization does not work as claimed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Subtract an estimated recombination factor from the peak amplitude by dividing $I_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ by $\\exp(-L/(v_{d}\\tau))$.**\nLet's perform this operation:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\exp(-L/(v_{d}\\tau))} \\approx \\frac{K \\frac{N_0}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D L/v_d}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{v_d \\tau}\\right)}{\\exp(-L/(v_{d}\\tau))} = K \\frac{N_0}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D L/v_d}}\n$$\nThis quantity does indeed remove the recombination-induced decay, leaving only the diffusive spreading decay ($L^{-1/2}$). However, the problem specifies that the method must be \"independent of the unknown injection magnitude and lifetime.\" This proposed method fails on two counts:\n1.  The procedure itself requires knowledge of the lifetime $\\tau$ to construct the correction factor $\\exp(-L/(v_{d}\\tau))$. If $\\tau$ is unknown (which it typically is in such an experiment), this correction cannot be applied.\n2.  The resulting quantity still contains the unknown factor $K N_0$, so it is not independent of the injection magnitude.\nTherefore, this option does not satisfy the requirements.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, only option A provides a normalization procedure that can be performed without prior knowledge of the lifetime or injection magnitude, and which produces a result that is free from both of these unknown parameters as well as the exponential decay factor due to recombination, thereby isolating the effect of diffusive spreading.",

This current density has drift and diffusion components:\n$$\nj_p(x,t) = p(x,t) v_d(x) - D(x) \\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial x}\n$$\nHere, the drift velocity $v_d(x) = \\mu(x)E$, and the transport coefficients $\\mu(x)$ and $D(x)$ depend on position through the temperature profile $T(x)$.\n\nThe velocity of the packet's center-of-mass, $\\bar{x}(t)$, can be approximated by the local drift velocity:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\bar{x}}{dt} = v_d(\\bar{x}(t)) = E \\mu(\\bar{x}(t))\n$$\nThe drift time $t_d$ to travel from $x=0$ to $x=L$ is found by integrating $dt = d\\bar{x}/v_d(\\bar{x})$:\n$$\nt_d = \\int_0^L \\frac{d\\bar{x}}{E\\mu(\\bar{x})} = \\frac{1}{E} \\int_0^L \\frac{dx'}{\\mu(x')}\n$$\n\nThe packet's variance, $\\sigma^2(t) = \\langle(x-\\bar{x}(t))^2\\rangle$, increases due to diffusion. The rate of change of the variance is given by $d\\sigma^2/dt \\approx 2D(\\bar{x}(t))$. Integrating this from $t=0$ to $t=t_d$ gives the total variance at arrival, $\\sigma^2$. We change the integration variable from time to position:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\int_0^{t_d} 2D(\\bar{x}(t)) dt = \\int_0^L 2D(x') \\frac{dx'}{E\\mu(x')} = \\frac{2}{E} \\int_0^L \\frac{D(x')}{\\mu(x')} dx'\n$$\n\nNow, we form the ratio of the apparent transport parameters, $D_{\\mathrm{app}}/\\mu_{\\mathrm{app}}$, using their definitions:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{app}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{app}}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2 / (2t_d)}{L / (Et_d)} = \\frac{E \\sigma^2}{2L}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\sigma^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{app}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{app}}} = \\frac{E}{2L} \\left( \\frac{2}{E} \\int_0^L \\frac{D(x')}{\\mu(x')} dx' \\right) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L \\frac{D(x')}{\\mu(x')} dx'\n$$\nThis general result shows the apparent ratio is the spatial average of the local ratio. Using the local Einstein relation, $D(x)/\\mu(x) = k_B T(x)/q$:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{app}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{app}}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L \\frac{k_B T(x')}{q} dx' = \\frac{k_B}{qL} \\int_0^L T(x') dx'\n$$\nThe measured ratio is proportional to the average temperature along the bar.\n\nFor the specified linear temperature profile, $T(x) = T_0 + \\alpha x$, we evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^L T(x') dx' = \\int_0^L (T_0 + \\alpha x') dx' = \\left[ T_0 x' + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha(x')^2 \\right]_0^L = T_0 L + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha L^2\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{app}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{app}}} = \\frac{k_B}{qL} \\left( T_0 L + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha L^2 \\right) = \\frac{k_B}{q} \\left( T_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha L \\right)\n$$\nThe quantity $k_B T/q$ has units of Volts (it is the thermal voltage). Therefore, the final expression is in the correct units.",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{k_B}{q} \\left( T_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha L \\right)}$$"
