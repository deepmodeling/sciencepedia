            "problem": "An intrinsic semiconductor wafer of uniform thickness $L$ is studied using a Time-of-Flight (TOF) technique, where a short optical pulse creates a narrow packet of electrons at the injection face $x=0$ at time $t=0$. There is no externally applied electric field. The contact at $x=0$ is blocking such that the carrier flux through it is zero, while the contact at $x=L$ perfectly collects carriers (acts as an absorbing boundary). Bulk recombination is negligible on the timescale of the experiment. The wafer thickness is $L=100~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The measured mean arrival time at the collecting contact, $\\overline{t}$, is recorded at three temperatures:\n- $T_1=250~\\mathrm{K}$ with $\\overline{t}_1=1.6667~\\mu\\mathrm{s}$,\n- $T_2=300~\\mathrm{K}$ with $\\overline{t}_2=1.3889~\\mu\\mathrm{s}$,\n- $T_3=350~\\mathrm{K}$ with $\\overline{t}_3=1.1905~\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nStarting from the one-dimensional diffusion equation and appropriate boundary conditions implied by the physical setup, derive a rigorous expression that relates the mean first-passage time from $x=0$ to $x=L$ to the diffusion coefficient $D$. Use this relation to compute $D$ at each temperature. Then, using the principle that for nondegenerate carriers in equilibrium the diffusion coefficient is connected to the drift mobility via the Einstein relation (which states that the ratio of diffusion coefficient to mobility is proportional to the absolute temperature), explain the conditions under which the scaling $D \\propto T$ is expected in this experiment. Verify whether the computed $D$ values are consistent with a linear dependence on $T$, and determine the proportionality constant $\\alpha$ in the relation $D=\\alpha T$.\n\nExpress $\\alpha$ in $\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ and round your final numerical value to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem will be addressed in four parts: first, a derivation of the relationship between the mean arrival time $\\overline{t}$ and the diffusion coefficient $D$; second, the calculation of $D$ at each given temperature; third, an explanation of the physical conditions under which $D$ is proportional to temperature $T$; and fourth, a verification of this proportionality and the determination of the constant $\\alpha$.\n\nStep 1: Derivation of the Mean Arrival Time\nThe transport of the electron packet in the absence of an electric field is governed by the one-dimensional diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n(x, t)}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 n(x, t)}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $n(x, t)$ is the electron concentration at position $x$ and time $t$, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nThe initial condition is a narrow packet of electrons created at $x=0$ at $t=0$, which can be modeled as a Dirac delta function:\n$$\nn(x, 0) = N_0 \\delta(x)\n$$\nwhere $N_0$ is the total number of injected electrons.\n\nThe boundary conditions are given by the physical setup:\n1.  A blocking contact at $x=0$: The particle flux $J$ is zero. The flux is given by Fick's first law, $J(x, t) = -D \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x}$. Thus, the boundary condition is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=0} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } t > 0\n    $$\n    This is a reflecting boundary.\n2.  A perfectly collecting contact at $x=L$: Any carrier reaching this boundary is immediately removed. This implies the concentration at this boundary is always zero. This is an absorbing boundary:\n    $$\n    n(L, t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } t > 0\n    $$\n\nTo find the mean first-passage time $\\overline{t}$ for a particle starting at $x_0$ to reach the absorbing boundary at $x=L$, we can solve the corresponding backward Kolmogorov equation. Let $S(x_0)$ be the mean time to be absorbed at $x=L$, given a starting position $x_0$. For a pure diffusion process, $S(x_0)$ satisfies the following ordinary differential equation:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 S(x_0)}{dx_0^2} = -1\n$$\nThe boundary conditions for $S(x_0)$ are derived from the behavior at the boundaries of the domain $[0, L]$:\n1.  At the absorbing boundary $x_0=L$, the time to absorption is zero by definition: $S(L) = 0$.\n2.  At the reflecting boundary $x_0=0$, there is no net movement across the boundary, which translates to a zero gradient for the mean exit time function: $\\frac{dS}{dx_0}\\bigg|_{x_0=0} = 0$.\n\nWe solve this second-order ODE. Integrating once with respect to $x_0$:\n$$\nD \\frac{dS}{dx_0} = -x_0 + C_1\n$$\nApplying the reflecting boundary condition at $x_0=0$:\n$$\nD \\frac{dS}{dx_0}\\bigg|_{x_0=0} = -0 + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = 0\n$$\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dx_0} = -\\frac{x_0}{D}\n$$\nIntegrating a second time:\n$$\nS(x_0) = -\\frac{x_0^2}{2D} + C_2\n$$\nApplying the absorbing boundary condition at $x_0=L$:\n$$\nS(L) = -\\frac{L^2}{2D} + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{L^2}{2D}\n$$\nTherefore, the mean first-passage time from an arbitrary starting point $x_0$ is:\n$$\nS(x_0) = \\frac{L^2 - x_0^2}{2D}\n$$\nIn this problem, the electrons are generated at the injection face $x=0$, so we are interested in $S(0)$. The measured mean arrival time $\\overline{t}$ is equivalent to $S(0)$.\n$$\n\\overline{t} = S(0) = \\frac{L^2}{2D}\n$$\n\nStep 2: Calculation of the Diffusion Coefficient\nFrom the derived relation, the diffusion coefficient $D$ can be calculated as:\n$$\nD = \\frac{L^2}{2\\overline{t}}\n$$\nWe are given $L = 100~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 100 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm} = 1 \\times 10^{-2}~\\mathrm{cm}$. The measured data points are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $T_1=250~\\mathrm{K}$, $\\overline{t}_1=1.6667~\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 1.6667 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{s}$\n    \\item $T_2=300~\\mathrm{K}$, $\\overline{t}_2=1.3889~\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 1.3889 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{s}$\n    \\item $T_3=350~\\mathrm{K}$, $\\overline{t}_3=1.1905~\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 1.1905 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{s}$\n\\end{itemize}\nNow we compute $D$ at each temperature.\nFor $T_1 = 250~\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\nD_1 = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-2}~\\mathrm{cm})^2}{2 \\times (1.6667 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{s})} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-4}}{3.3334 \\times 10^{-6}}~\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s} \\approx 29.9994~\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nFor $T_2 = 300~\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\nD_2 = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-2}~\\mathrm{cm})^2}{2 \\times (1.3889 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{s})} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-4}}{2.7778 \\times 10^{-6}}~\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s} \\approx 35.9997~\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nFor $T_3 = 350~\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\nD_3 = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-2}~\\mathrm{cm})^2}{2 \\times (1.1905 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{s})} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-4}}{2.3810 \\times 10^{-6}}~\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s} \\approx 41.9992~\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe values are extremely close to $30.00$, $36.00$, and $42.00~\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, respectively.\n\nStep 3: Conditions for Linear Dependence of $D$ on $T$\nThe Einstein relation connects the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the drift mobility $\\mu$ for charge carriers in a semiconductor under non-degenerate conditions:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{\\mu} = \\frac{k_B T}{q}\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $q$ is the magnitude of the elementary charge, $e$. For electrons, this is $D = \\mu \\frac{k_B T}{e}$.\n\nThe problem posits a relationship of the form $D = \\alpha T$, where $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant. Equating the two expressions for $D$:\n$$\n\\alpha T = \\mu \\frac{k_B T}{e}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\mu \\frac{k_B}{e}\n$$\nFor $\\alpha$ to be a constant, the mobility $\\mu$ must be independent of temperature $T$. In semiconductors, carrier mobility is generally temperature-dependent due to various scattering mechanisms. The temperature dependence of mobility typically follows a power law, $\\mu \\propto T^n$. The exponent $n$ depends on the dominant scattering mechanism:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Lattice (phonon) scattering: $\\mu \\propto T^{-3/2}$\n    \\item Ionized impurity scattering: $\\mu \\propto T^{3/2}$\n    \\item Neutral impurity scattering: The scattering cross-section is nearly independent of carrier energy, making the mobility $\\mu$ approximately independent of temperature, i.e., $\\mu \\propto T^0$.\n\\end{itemize}\nTherefore, the condition under which the scaling $D \\propto T$ is expected is that the dominant scattering mechanism for the electrons is scattering from neutral impurities or defects over the temperature range of the experiment.\n\nStep 4: Verification and Calculation of $\\alpha$\nWe now check if the computed values of $D$ are consistent with the linear relationship $D = \\alpha T$. We calculate the ratio $\\alpha = D/T$ for each data point using the integer values for $D$.\n$$\n\\alpha_1 = \\frac{30.00~\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}}{250~\\mathrm{K}} = 0.12~\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_2 = \\frac{36.00~\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}}{300~\\mathrm{K}} = 0.12~\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_3 = \\frac{42.00~\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{s}}{350~\\mathrm{K}} = 0.12~\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}\n$$\nThe value of the ratio $\\alpha = D/T$ is constant across all three measurements. This confirms that the data is perfectly consistent with a linear dependence of the diffusion coefficient on temperature. The proportionality constant is $\\alpha = 0.12~\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures. Thus, we write the constant as $0.1200~\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.",

We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe diffusion coefficient $D$ for a three-dimensional isotropic system with an energy-independent momentum relaxation time $\\tau$ is given by\n$$D = \\frac{1}{3} \\langle v_g^2 \\rangle \\tau$$\nwhere $\\langle v_g^2 \\rangle$ is the thermal average of the squared group velocity. The problem asks for the ratio $D/D_0$, where $D_0$ is the diffusion coefficient in the parabolic limit ($\\alpha \\to 0$). Since $\\tau$ is constant, this ratio simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{D}{D_0} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\langle v_g^2 \\rangle \\tau}{\\frac{1}{3} \\langle v_{g0}^2 \\rangle_0 \\tau} = \\frac{\\langle v_g^2 \\rangle}{\\langle v_{g0}^2 \\rangle_0}$$\nHere, $v_g$ is the group velocity for the nonparabolic band, $v_{g0}$ is the group velocity for the parabolic band, and the averages $\\langle ... \\rangle$ and $\\langle ... \\rangle_0$ are performed over their respective distributions.\n\nFirst, we analyze the parabolic case ($\\alpha \\to 0$) to determine the baseline, $D_0$, and the average $\\langle v_{g0}^2 \\rangle_0$.\nIn the parabolic limit, the dispersion relation is $E = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^*}$.\nThe group velocity is $v_{g0}(k) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\frac{dE}{dk} = \\frac{\\hbar k}{m^*}$.\nThe squared group velocity as a function of energy is $v_{g0}^2(E) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{m^{*2}} = \\frac{2E}{m^*}$.\nThe thermal average is defined as:\n$$\\langle v_{g0}^2 \\rangle_0 = \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty v_{g0}^2(E) g_0(E) \\exp(-E/k_B T) dE}{\\int_0^\\infty g_0(E) \\exp(-E/k_B T) dE}$$\nwhere $g_0(E)$ is the density of states for a parabolic band in three dimensions, given by $g_0(E) = \\frac{(2m^*)^{3/2}}{2\\pi^2\\hbar^3}E^{1/2}$.\nSubstituting $v_{g0}^2(E)$ gives:\n$$\\langle v_{g0}^2 \\rangle_0 = \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{2E}{m^*} E^{1/2} \\exp(-E/k_B T) dE}{\\int_0^\\infty E^{1/2} \\exp(-E/k_B T) dE} = \\frac{2}{m^*} \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty E^{3/2} \\exp(-E/k_B T) dE}{\\int_0^\\infty E^{1/2} \\exp(-E/k_B T) dE}$$\nThese are standard Gamma function integrals of the form $\\int_0^\\infty x^n \\exp(-ax) dx = \\frac{\\Gamma(n+1)}{a^{n+1}}$.\nThe ratio of integrals is $\\frac{\\Gamma(5/2)(k_B T)^{5/2}}{\\Gamma(3/2)(k_B T)^{3/2}} = \\frac{(3/2)\\Gamma(3/2)}{\\Gamma(3/2)} k_B T = \\frac{3}{2}k_B T$. This is the average energy $\\langle E \\rangle_0$.\nThus, $\\langle v_{g0}^2 \\rangle_0 = \\frac{2}{m^*} \\langle E \\rangle_0 = \\frac{2}{m^*} \\left(\\frac{3}{2} k_B T\\right) = \\frac{3k_B T}{m^*}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the nonparabolic case. The dispersion is $E(1+\\alpha E)=\\frac{\\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m^{*}}$.\nWe need to find the group velocity $v_g(E)$ and the density of states $g(E)$ to first order in $\\alpha$.\n\n1.  Group velocity $v_g(E)$:\n    We differentiate the dispersion relation with respect to $k$:\n    $$\\frac{dE}{dk}(1+2\\alpha E) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k}{m^*}$$\n    The group velocity is $v_g = \\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\frac{dE}{dk} = \\frac{\\hbar k}{m^*(1+2\\alpha E)}$.\n    The squared group velocity is $v_g^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{m^{*2}(1+2\\alpha E)^2}$.\n    Substituting $k^2$ from the dispersion relation:\n    $$v_g^2 = \\frac{2m^* E(1+\\alpha E)}{m^{*2}(1+2\\alpha E)^2} = \\frac{2E}{m^*} \\frac{1+\\alpha E}{(1+2\\alpha E)^2}$$\n    Expanding to first order in $\\alpha$ using $(1+x)^n \\approx 1+nx$:\n    $$v_g^2(E) \\approx \\frac{2E}{m^*} (1+\\alpha E)(1-4\\alpha E) \\approx \\frac{2E}{m^*} (1-3\\alpha E)$$\n\n2.  Density of states $g(E)$:\n    The number of states per unit volume with wave vector less than $k$ is $n(k) = \\frac{k^3}{3\\pi^2}$.\n    The density of states per unit volume is $g(E) = \\frac{dn}{dE} = \\frac{dn}{dk}\\frac{dk}{dE} = \\frac{k^2}{\\pi^2}\\frac{dk}{dE}$.\n    From $v_g = \\frac{\\hbar k}{m^*(1+2\\alpha E)}$, we have $\\frac{dk}{dE} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar v_g} = \\frac{m^*(1+2\\alpha E)}{\\hbar^2 k}$.\n    $$g(E) = \\frac{k^2}{\\pi^2} \\frac{m^*(1+2\\alpha E)}{\\hbar^2 k} = \\frac{m^* k}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}(1+2\\alpha E)$$\n    From the dispersion, $k(E) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*}}{\\hbar}\\sqrt{E(1+\\alpha E)}$. Substituting this in:\n    $$g(E) = \\frac{m^*}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*}}{\\hbar}\\sqrt{E(1+\\alpha E)}\\right)(1+2\\alpha E) = \\frac{(2m^*)^{3/2}}{2\\pi^2\\hbar^3}\\sqrt{E} \\sqrt{1+\\alpha E}(1+2\\alpha E)$$\n    This can be written as $g(E) = g_0(E) \\sqrt{1+\\alpha E}(1+2\\alpha E)$.\n    Expanding to first order in $\\alpha$:\n    $$g(E) \\approx g_0(E) \\left(1+\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E\\right) (1+2\\alpha E) \\approx g_0(E) \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{2}\\alpha E\\right)$$\n\nNow, we compute the thermal average $\\langle v_g^2 \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle v_g^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty v_g^2(E) g(E) \\exp(-E/k_B T) dE}{\\int_0^\\infty g(E) \\exp(-E/k_B T) dE}$$\nLet's approximate the numerator and denominator to first order in $\\alpha$.\nLet $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\nThe numerator is $N = \\int_0^\\infty v_g^2(E) g(E) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE$.\n$$ N \\approx \\int_0^\\infty \\left[\\frac{2E}{m^*}(1-3\\alpha E)\\right] \\left[g_0(E)\\left(1+\\frac{5}{2}\\alpha E\\right)\\right] \\exp(-\\beta E) dE $$\n$$ N \\approx \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{2E}{m^*} g_0(E) \\left(1-3\\alpha E + \\frac{5}{2}\\alpha E\\right) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{2E}{m^*} g_0(E) \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E\\right) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE $$\nWe can express this using parabolic-band averages $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle_0$:\n$$N \\approx \\left\\langle \\frac{2E}{m^*} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E\\right) \\right\\rangle_0 \\int_0^\\infty g_0(E) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE$$\n$$N \\approx \\left(\\left\\langle \\frac{2E}{m^*} \\right\\rangle_0 - \\frac{\\alpha}{m^*} \\langle E^2 \\rangle_0\\right) \\int_0^\\infty g_0(E) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE$$\nWe know $\\langle \\frac{2E}{m^*} \\rangle_0 = \\langle v_{g0}^2 \\rangle_0 = \\frac{3k_B T}{m^*}$.\nWe need $\\langle E^2 \\rangle_0 = \\frac{\\int E^{5/2}\\exp(-\\beta E)dE}{\\int E^{1/2}\\exp(-\\beta E)dE} = \\frac{\\Gamma(7/2)\\beta^{-7/2}}{\\Gamma(3/2)\\beta^{-3/2}} = \\frac{(5/2)(3/2)\\Gamma(3/2)}{(1/\\beta)^2\\Gamma(3/2)} = \\frac{15}{4}(k_B T)^2$.\nSo, $N \\approx \\left(\\frac{3k_B T}{m^*} - \\frac{\\alpha}{m^*} \\frac{15}{4}(k_B T)^2\\right) \\int_0^\\infty g_0(E) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE$.\n$N \\approx \\frac{3k_B T}{m^*} \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{4}\\alpha k_B T\\right) \\int_0^\\infty g_0(E) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE$.\n\nThe denominator is $Z = \\int_0^\\infty g(E) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE$.\n$$Z \\approx \\int_0^\\infty g_0(E)\\left(1+\\frac{5}{2}\\alpha E\\right)\\exp(-\\beta E) dE = \\left\\langle 1+\\frac{5}{2}\\alpha E \\right\\rangle_0 \\int_0^\\infty g_0(E) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE$$\n$$Z \\approx \\left(1+\\frac{5}{2}\\alpha \\langle E \\rangle_0\\right) \\int_0^\\infty g_0(E) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE$$\nSince $\\langle E \\rangle_0 = \\frac{3}{2}k_B T$,\n$$Z \\approx \\left(1+\\frac{5}{2}\\alpha \\frac{3}{2}k_B T\\right) \\int g_0(E)\\exp(-\\beta E)dE = \\left(1+\\frac{15}{4}\\alpha k_B T\\right) \\int_0^\\infty g_0(E) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE$$\n\nNow, we compute the ratio $\\langle v_g^2 \\rangle = N/Z$:\n$$\\langle v_g^2 \\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\frac{3k_B T}{m^*} \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{4}\\alpha k_B T\\right)}{1+\\frac{15}{4}\\alpha k_B T}$$\nUsing the approximation $(1+x)^{-1} \\approx 1-x$ for small $x$:\n$$\\langle v_g^2 \\rangle \\approx \\frac{3k_B T}{m^*} \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{4}\\alpha k_B T\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{15}{4}\\alpha k_B T\\right)$$\nExpanding and keeping terms up to first order in $\\alpha$:\n$$\\langle v_g^2 \\rangle \\approx \\frac{3k_B T}{m^*} \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{4}\\alpha k_B T - \\frac{15}{4}\\alpha k_B T\\right) = \\frac{3k_B T}{m^*} \\left(1 - \\frac{20}{4}\\alpha k_B T\\right)$$\n$$\\langle v_g^2 \\rangle \\approx \\frac{3k_B T}{m^*} (1 - 5\\alpha k_B T)$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $D/D_0$:\n$$\\frac{D}{D_0} = \\frac{\\langle v_g^2 \\rangle}{\\langle v_{g0}^2 \\rangle_0} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{3k_B T}{m^*} (1 - 5\\alpha k_B T)}{\\frac{3k_B T}{m^*}}$$\n$$\\frac{D}{D_0} \\approx 1 - 5\\alpha k_B T$$",
