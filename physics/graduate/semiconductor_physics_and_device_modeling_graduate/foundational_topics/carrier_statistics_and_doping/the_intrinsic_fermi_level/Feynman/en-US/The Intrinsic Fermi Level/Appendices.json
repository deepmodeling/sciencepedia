A common simplification places $E_i$ precisely at the middle of the bandgap, but this is only true under specific conditions. This practice challenges you to think qualitatively about the physical factors that determine the true position of $E_i$, specifically focusing on how the asymmetry in charge carrier effective masses ($m_n^*$ and $m_p^*$) influences the density of states and, consequently, shifts the Fermi level to maintain charge neutrality .",

The solution is derived by equating the electron and hole concentrations in an intrinsic semiconductor.\n\nThe concentration of electrons, $n$, in the conduction band is given by the integral of the density of states in the conduction band, $g_c(E)$, multiplied by the probability of occupancy, which is given by the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, $f(E)$. The integral is taken over all available energy states in the conduction band, from the conduction band minimum, $E_c$, to infinity.\n$$n = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} g_c(E) f(E) dE$$\nSimilarly, the concentration of holes, $p$, in the valence band is given by the integral of the density of states in the valence band, $g_v(E)$, multiplied by the probability of a state being empty, which is $1-f(E)$.

The correction term is therefore subtracted from the midgap energy. This means $E_i  E_g/2$, so the intrinsic Fermi level lies **below** the midgap energy.
