The parameters and conditions are unambiguous.\n- **Completeness**: The problem is self-contained.

A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Part (a): Analysis of the approximation $n \\approx n_{i}$\nWe begin with the charge neutrality condition for an uncompensated, n-type semiconductor, assuming complete ionization of shallow donors ($N_D^+ = N_D$):\n$$n - p = N_{D}$$\nThe mass-action law in thermal equilibrium states that $np = n_{i}^{2}$. We can express the hole concentration $p$ as $p = n_{i}^{2}/n$. Substituting this into the neutrality equation yields:\n$$n - \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{n} = N_{D}$$\nMultiplying by $n$ and rearranging gives a quadratic equation for the electron concentration $n$:\n$$n^{2} - N_{D}n - n_{i}^{2} = 0$$\nThis equation governs the electron concentration in terms of the donor concentration $N_{D}$ and the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_{i}(T)$. The physically valid solution (since concentration must be positive) is obtained from the quadratic formula:\n$$n = \\frac{-(-N_{D}) + \\sqrt{(-N_{D})^{2} - 4(1)(-n_{i}^{2})}}{2(1)} = \\frac{N_{D} + \\sqrt{N_{D}^{2} + 4n_{i}^{2}}}{2}$$\nWe wish to find the conditions under which the approximation $n \\approx n_{i}$ is valid. This approximation implies that the semiconductor behaves as if it were intrinsic, despite the presence of dopants. Let's analyze the exact solution for $n$.\nThe expression can be rewritten as:\n$$n = n_{i} \\left( \\frac{N_{D}}{2n_{i}} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_{D}}{2n_{i}}\\right)^{2} + 1} \\right)$$\nFor $n$ to be approximately equal to $n_{i}$, the term $\\frac{N_{D}}{2n_{i}}$ must be much smaller than $1$. Let's denote $x = \\frac{N_{D}}{2n_{i}}$. The condition is $x \\ll 1$. In this case, we can use the Taylor expansion $\\sqrt{1+x^2} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x^2$. However, substituting this back into the expression for $n$ gives $n \\approx n_i(x + 1 + x^2/2) = n_i + N_D/2 + N_D^2/(8n_i)$, which is a bit complex.\n\nA more direct approach is to consider the limit $N_D \\ll 2n_i$ in the original solution for $n$. If $N_D$ is small, then $N_D^2$ is much smaller than $4n_i^2$. The term under the square root becomes $\\sqrt{N_{D}^{2} + 4n_{i}^{2}} \\approx \\sqrt{4n_{i}^{2}} = 2n_{i}$.\nSubstituting this approximation into the solution for $n$:\n$$n \\approx \\frac{N_{D} + 2n_{i}}{2} = n_{i} + \\frac{N_{D}}{2}$$\nFor the approximation $n \\approx n_i$ to hold, the second term, $\\frac{N_{D}}{2}$, must be negligible compared to $n_{i}$. This leads to the condition:\n$$\\frac{N_{D}}{2} \\ll n_{i} \\quad \\text{or simply} \\quad N_{D} \\ll n_{i}(T)$$\nIn conclusion, the approximation that the electron concentration $n$ is nearly equal to the intrinsic concentration $n_i$ is valid when the donor concentration $N_{D}$ is substantially smaller than the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i(T)$. Since $n_{i}(T)$ is a strong, exponentially increasing function of temperature $T$, for any lightly doped sample (fixed $N_D$), there is a sufficiently high temperature range where this condition is met and the semiconductor behaves intrinsically. This requires the assumption that donors are completely ionized, which is typically true at these higher temperatures.\n\n### Part (b): Calculation of $N_{D,\\max}$ at $T = 450\\,\\mathrm{K}$\nThe criterion for the approximation is given as $\\frac{|n - n_{i}|}{n_{i}} \\leq \\delta$, where $\\delta = 0.01$. Since doping is n-type ($N_D > 0$), the electron concentration $n$ will be greater than $n_i$. Thus, $|n - n_{i}| = n - n_{i}$. The criterion becomes:\n$$\\frac{n - n_{i}}{n_{i}} \\leq \\delta \\implies n \\leq (1+\\delta)n_{i}$$\nTo find the maximum donor concentration $N_{D,\\max}$ that satisfies this, we use the relationship between $n$, $N_D$, and $n_i$ derived from charge neutrality and mass action:\n$$N_{D} = n - p = n - \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{n}$$\n$N_{D}$ is an increasing function of $n$ for $n > n_i$. Therefore, $N_{D,\\max}$ corresponds to the maximum allowed value of $n$, which is $n = (1+\\delta)n_{i}$. Substituting this into the equation for $N_D$:\n$$N_{D,\\max} = (1+\\delta)n_i - \\frac{n_i^2}{(1+\\delta)n_i} = n_i \\left( (1+\\delta) - \\frac{1}{1+\\delta} \\right)$$\n$$N_{D,\\max} = n_i \\left( \\frac{(1+\\delta)^2 - 1}{1+\\delta} \\right) = n_i \\left( \\frac{1 + 2\\delta + \\delta^2 - 1}{1+\\delta} \\right) = n_i \\frac{2\\delta + \\delta^2}{1+\\delta}$$\nNow we must calculate $n_i(T)$ at $T = 450\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nFirst, calculate the bandgap $E_{g}$ at $T = 450\\,\\mathrm{K}$ using the Varshni relation:\n$$E_{g}(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) = E_{g0} - \\frac{\\alpha T^{2}}{T+\\beta} = 1.17\\,\\mathrm{eV} - \\frac{(4.73\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) (450\\,\\mathrm{K})^{2}}{450\\,\\mathrm{K} + 636\\,\\mathrm{K}}$$\n$$E_{g}(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 1.17 - \\frac{4.73\\times 10^{-4} \\times 202500}{1086}\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.17 - \\frac{95.7825}{1086}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n$$E_{g}(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 1.17 - 0.0881975 = 1.0818025\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nNext, calculate the effective densities of states $N_C$ and $N_V$ at $T=450\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$N_{C}(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) = N_{C}(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\left(\\frac{450\\,\\mathrm{K}}{300\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)^{3/2} = (2.80\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})(1.5)^{1.5} \\approx 5.1439\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n$$N_{V}(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) = N_{V}(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\left(\\frac{450\\,\\mathrm{K}}{300\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)^{3/2} = (1.04\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})(1.5)^{1.5} \\approx 1.9106\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nNow calculate the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$:\n$$n_i(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) = \\sqrt{N_{C}(450\\,\\mathrm{K})N_{V}(450\\,\\mathrm{K})} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{g}(450\\,\\mathrm{K})}{2k_\\mathrm{B}T}\\right)$$\nThe term in the exponent is:\n$$\\frac{E_{g}}{2k_\\mathrm{B}T} = \\frac{1.0818025\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{2 \\times (8.617333\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\times (450\\,\\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{1.0818025}{0.077556} \\approx 13.9486$$\nThe pre-exponential factor is:\n$$\\sqrt{N_{C}N_{V}} = \\sqrt{(5.1439\\times 10^{19})(1.9106\\times 10^{19})}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\approx \\sqrt{9.8273\\times 10^{38}}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\approx 3.1349\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nSo, the intrinsic concentration is:\n$$n_i(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx (3.1349\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) \\exp(-13.9486) \\approx (3.1349\\times 10^{19})(8.756\\times 10^{-7})\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n$$n_i(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 2.7449\\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nFinally, we can calculate $N_{D,\\max}$ using $\\delta = 0.01$ and the derived formula:\n$$N_{D,\\max} = n_i \\frac{2(0.01) + (0.01)^2}{1+0.01} = n_i \\frac{0.0201}{1.01} \\approx n_i(0.019901)$$\n$$N_{D,\\max} \\approx (2.7449\\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) (0.019901) \\approx 5.4627\\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nRounding the answer to three significant figures, we get $5.46 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.",

            "problem": "Consider two bulk crystalline semiconductors $S_1$ and $S_2$ at temperature $T$, both in thermodynamic equilibrium. Semiconductor $S_1$ has a direct bandgap with a single conduction-band minimum at $k = 0$ (valley degeneracy $g_v = 1$). Semiconductor $S_2$ has an indirect bandgap with $g_v = 6$ equivalent conduction-band minima located at symmetry-related nonzero wavevectors. Assume both materials have the same bandgap $E_g$, identical conduction-band curvature per valley (i.e., the same scalar conduction effective mass $m_c^{*}$ for each valley), and identical valence-band edge structure (heavy- and light-hole curvatures combining to the same net valence effective mass $m_v^{*}$). Both materials are nondegenerately doped $n$-type with shallow donors of density $N_D$, which are fully ionized at $T$, and the crystalline quality is such that the bands are well approximated as parabolic near the extrema.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of carrier statistics, namely the Fermi–Dirac distribution $f(E)$ and the expressions for equilibrium carrier densities as integrals of the product of a density of states and an occupancy factor, analyze how the direct versus indirect character of the bandgap enters the density of states and the resulting equilibrium carrier concentrations.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of semiconductor physics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information for a comparative analysis, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The problem is a standard conceptual question in solid-state physics.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental expressions for equilibrium carrier concentrations in a semiconductor, which are derived from the product of the density of states (DOS) and the Fermi-Dirac distribution.\n\nThe Fermi-Dirac distribution, $f(E)$, gives the probability of occupancy of an electronic state at energy $E$ in a system of fermions at thermodynamic equilibrium:\n$$f(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{(E - E_\\mathrm{F})/(k_\\mathrm{B} T)}}$$\nwhere $E_\\mathrm{F}$ is the Fermi energy, $k_\\mathrm{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This distribution is a fundamental consequence of statistical mechanics and applies universally to fermionic systems in thermal equilibrium, regardless of the specific mechanisms (e.g., involving phonons or photons) that facilitate transitions between states.\n\nThe equilibrium electron concentration, $n_0$, is found by integrating the product of the conduction band DOS, $g_C(E)$, and the occupancy function, $f(E)$, from the conduction band edge, $E_C$, to infinity:\n$$n_0 = \\int_{E_C}^{\\infty} g_C(E) f(E) dE$$\nSimilarly, the equilibrium hole concentration, $p_0$, is found by integrating the product of the valence band DOS, $g_V(E)$, and the probability of a state being empty, $1-f(E)$, from negative infinity to the valence band edge, $E_V$:\n$$p_0 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{E_V} g_V(E) [1 - f(E)] dE$$\nFor a 3D semiconductor with parabolic bands, the DOS for a single energy valley is proportional to the square root of energy measured from the band edge. For the conduction band, the total DOS is the sum over all equivalent valleys. If there are $g_v$ equivalent conduction band minima (valleys) and each has a scalar effective mass $m_c^*$, the total DOS is:\n$$g_C(E) = g_v \\frac{\\sqrt{2} (m_c^*)^{3/2}}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\sqrt{E - E_C}$$\nFor both the direct ($S_1$) and indirect ($S_2$) semiconductors, the energy dependence is $\\sqrt{E-E_C}$. The direct/indirect nature of the gap enters through the valley degeneracy parameter, $g_v$. For $S_1$ (direct), $g_v=1$. For $S_2$ (indirect), $g_v=6$.\n\nUnder the non-degenerate assumption ($E_C-E_\\mathrm{F} \\gg k_\\mathrm{B} T$), the Fermi-Dirac function can be approximated by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, $f(E) \\approx e^{-(E - E_\\mathrm{F})/(k_\\mathrm{B} T)}$. The integral for $n_0$ becomes:\n$$n_0 = N_C e^{-(E_C - E_\\mathrm{F})/(k_\\mathrm{B} T)}$$\nwhere $N_C$ is the effective density of states in the conduction band:\n$$N_C = g_v \\cdot 2 \\left( \\frac{m_c^* k_\\mathrm{B} T}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\right)^{3/2}$$\nSimilarly, for holes:\n$$p_0 = N_V e^{-(E_\\mathrm{F} - E_V)/(k_\\mathrm{B} T)}$$\nwhere $N_V$ is the effective density of states in the valence band. Given the identical valence band structure, $N_V$ is the same for $S_1$ and $S_2$.\n$$N_V = 2 \\left( \\frac{m_v^* k_\\mathrm{B} T}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\right)^{3/2}$$\nThe core relationship, known as the law of mass action, is independent of the Fermi level:\n$$n_0 p_0 = N_C N_V e^{-E_g / (k_\\mathrm{B} T)} = n_i^2$$\nwhere $E_g = E_C - E_V$ is the bandgap energy and $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration.\nUsing the expressions for $N_C$ and $N_V$, we find the dependence of $n_i$ on the band structure parameters:\n$$n_i = \\sqrt{N_C N_V} e^{-E_g / (2k_\\mathrm{B} T)} = \\sqrt{g_v} \\left[ 2 \\left( \\frac{k_\\mathrm{B} T}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\right)^{3/2} (m_c^* m_v^*)^{3/4} \\right] e^{-E_g / (2k_\\mathrm{B} T)}$$\nThis derivation shows that the equilibrium carrier concentrations depend on band-edge parameters ($E_g$, $m_c^*$, $m_v^*$, $g_v$) and temperature. The character of the bandgap (direct vs. indirect) influences these concentrations *only* through its effect on these parameters, most notably the valley degeneracy $g_v$. The physical location of the band minima in k-space, which defines the direct/indirect nature, does not otherwise appear in the final expressions for total carrier density.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the direct versus indirect character does not introduce any modification to carrier statistics beyond the band-edge density-of-states parameters (effective masses and valley degeneracies). Consequently, for equal $E_g$, $m_c^{*}$, $m_v^{*}$, and $g_v$, the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$ would be identical in direct and indirect semiconductors.**\nThis statement is correct. As derived above, the calculation of equilibrium concentrations relies on the density of states and the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The direct/indirect nature of the bandgap is incorporated into the density of states via the valley degeneracy $g_v$ and the effective mass parameters. No other modifications to the principles of statistical mechanics are required. The second part of the statement is a direct logical consequence: if all the parameters in the equation for $n_i$ (namely $E_g$, $m_c^*$, $m_v^*$, and $g_v$) are held constant, $n_i$ must be the same, irrespective of any other distinction between 'direct' and 'indirect'.\n**Verdict for A:** Correct.\n\n**B. Because radiative recombination is allowed without phonons in a direct bandgap, $S_1$ has a lower equilibrium intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$ than $S_2$ for the same $E_g$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It confuses kinetics (transition rates) with thermodynamics (equilibrium state). The rates of recombination and generation determine how quickly a system reaches equilibrium, but they do not alter the properties of the equilibrium state itself. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the principle of detailed balance ensures that the rate of generation of electron-hole pairs equals the rate of recombination for every possible pathway. A higher radiative recombination coefficient in a direct-gap material is balanced by a correspondingly higher coefficient for thermal generation via photon absorption. The equilibrium concentrations, including $n_i$, are determined by the statistical distribution of carriers over the available energy states (DOS), not by the mechanisms that move them between states.\n**Verdict for B:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The conduction-band density of states near the minimum is qualitatively different in an indirect bandgap: it is proportional to $(E - E_C)$ in an indirect semiconductor but proportional to $\\sqrt{E - E_C}$ in a direct semiconductor.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The DOS for a 3D parabolic band is proportional to $\\sqrt{E - E_{edge}}$. This holds for each valley, regardless of its position in k-space. The total conduction-band DOS is the sum of the DOS from all equivalent valleys. Since all valleys are at the same energy $E_C$ (by definition of \"equivalent minima\"), the total DOS is simply the single-valley DOS multiplied by the valley degeneracy $g_v$.\n$g_{C,total}(E) = \\sum_{i=1}^{g_v} g_{C,valley_i}(E) = g_v \\cdot (\\text{single-valley DOS}) \\propto g_v \\sqrt{E-E_C}$.\nThe functional dependence on energy, $\\sqrt{E-E_C}$, is the same for both direct and indirect semiconductors described in this problem. The magnitude of the DOS is different due to $g_v$, but the qualitative functional form is identical.\n**Verdict for C:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. With $N_D$ fully ionized under nondegenerate conditions, the majority electron concentration $n_0$ in both $S_1$ and $S_2$ is approximately $N_D$, whereas the minority hole concentration $p_0$ differs between $S_1$ and $S_2$ by an amount set by the conduction-band valley degeneracy $g_v$, because $n_i$ scales as $\\sqrt{g_v}$ when $m_c^{*}$, $m_v^{*}$, and $E_g$ are fixed.**\nThis statement is correct.\n1. For an n-type semiconductor with fully ionized donors, charge neutrality gives $n_0 = p_0 + N_D$. In the n-type case, $n_0 \\gg p_0$, so $n_0 \\approx N_D$. This approximation holds for both $S_1$ and $S_2$ as it depends on doping, not the specifics of the band structure.\n2. The minority hole concentration is given by the law of mass action: $p_0 = n_i^2/n_0$. Since $n_0 \\approx N_D$ for both, we have $p_0 \\approx n_i^2/N_D$.\n3. As derived earlier, $n_i \\propto \\sqrt{g_v}$ when other parameters are fixed. Therefore, $n_i^2 \\propto g_v$.\n4. This means $p_0 \\propto g_v$. For semiconductor $S_1$, $g_v=1$. For $S_2$, $g_v=6$. All other relevant parameters ($E_g, m_c^*, m_v^*, T, N_D$) are given as being the same. Thus, the ratio of minority concentrations is $p_{0,S2}/p_{0,S1} \\approx n_{i,S2}^2 / n_{i,S1}^2 = g_{v,S2}/g_{v,S1} = 6/1 = 6$. The minority hole concentration indeed differs, and this difference is directly determined by the valley degeneracy $g_v$. The reasoning provided in the option is entirely sound.\n**Verdict for D:** Correct.\n\n**E. In an indirect bandgap, the equilibrium occupancy deviates from the standard Fermi–Dirac form $f(E) = 1/\\!\\left(1 + e^{(E - E_\\mathrm{F})/(k_\\mathrm{B} T)}\\right)$, because phonon participation in transitions changes the equilibrium statistics.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The Fermi-Dirac distribution is a foundational principle of statistical mechanics for fermions in thermodynamic equilibrium. It is not dependent on the dynamics of how equilibrium is achieved. The necessity of phonons for momentum conservation in transitions within an indirect-gap material affects kinetic properties like a carrier's lifetime and optical absorption/emission spectra, but not the equilibrium occupation probability of energy states. The occupancy of states in any system at thermal equilibrium is governed by the appropriate statistical distribution (Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein), which is a function of energy, not transition pathways.\n**Verdict for E:** Incorrect.",

            "introduction": "While foundational models often use a single, isotropic effective mass, the band structure of essential semiconductors like silicon is more complex, featuring multiple anisotropic valleys. This anisotropy requires a more sophisticated understanding of effective mass, as the value depends on the physical property being described. This advanced practice  builds upon the density-of-states concepts from earlier exercises  to distinguish the density-of-states effective mass ($m_{dos}^*$) from the conductivity effective mass ($m_{cond}^*$), a vital skill for accurately modeling both equilibrium statistics and carrier transport.",

            "problem": "A three-dimensional semiconductor has a conduction band comprised of $g_v$ equivalent anisotropic parabolic valleys. In the principal axes of each valley, the dispersion is $E(\\mathbf{k}) = E_C + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{k_l^2}{m_l} + \\frac{k_{t1}^2}{m_t} + \\frac{k_{t2}^2}{m_t}\\right)$, where $m_l$ and $m_t$ are the longitudinal and transverse band-edge effective masses of the valley, and $E_C$ is the conduction-band edge.

A solution will be derived based on fundamental principles.\n\n### Derivation of Effective Masses\n\n**1. Density-of-States Effective Mass ($m_d^*$ or $m_{dos}$)**\n\nThe equilibrium electron concentration, $n$, is determined by the integral of the density of states, $g(E)$, multiplied by the Fermi-Dirac occupation probability, $f(E)$:\n$$n = \\int_{E_C}^\\infty g(E) f(E) dE$$\nThe density of states is derived by counting the number of states in $k$-space per unit energy. For a single valley, the number of states (including spin degeneracy) within a volume $V_k$ in $k$-space is $N_k = 2 V_k / (2\\pi)^3$. The surface of constant energy $\\mathcal{E} = E - E_C$ is an ellipsoid defined by $\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{k_l^2}{m_l} + \\frac{k_{t1}^2}{m_t} + \\frac{k_{t2}^2}{m_t}\\right)$.\n\nThe volume of this ellipsoid is $V_k(\\mathcal{E}) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{2\\mathcal{E}}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\sqrt{m_l m_t m_t}$.\nThe cumulative number of states up to energy $E$ for a single valley is:\n$$N_1(E) = \\frac{2}{(2\\pi)^3} V_k(E-E_C) = \\frac{1}{3\\pi^2} \\left(\\frac{2(E-E_C)}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} (m_l m_t^2)^{1/2}$$\nThe density of states for a single valley is $g_1(E) = \\frac{dN_1(E)}{dE}$:\n$$g_1(E) = \\frac{(m_l m_t^2)^{1/2} \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\sqrt{E-E_C}$$\nTo define an effective mass, we compare this to the DOS for a standard isotropic parabolic band, $g_{iso}(E) = \\frac{(m^*)^{3/2} \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\sqrt{E-E_C}$. Equating $g_1(E)$ and $g_{iso}(E)$, we find the density-of-states effective mass per valley:\n$$(m_d^*)^{3/2} = (m_l m_t^2)^{1/2} \\implies m_d^* = (m_l m_t^2)^{1/3}$$\nThis is the geometric mean of the three principal effective masses. The total density of states for the semiconductor is $g(E) = g_v \\cdot g_1(E)$. The quantity $m_d^*$ is the fundamental mass parameter that characterizes the density of states.\nFor the silicon-like case:\n$$m_d^* = (0.916\\,m_0 \\cdot (0.190\\,m_0)^2)^{1/3} = m_0 (0.916 \\cdot 0.0361)^{1/3} = m_0 (0.0330676)^{1/3} \\approx 0.321\\,m_0$$\nThe equilibrium concentration $n$ is governed by this mass. The fact that the statistics are degenerate ($E_\\mathrm{F} - E_C \\gg k_\\mathrm{B} T$) changes the occupation function $f(E)$ to a step function, altering the result of the integral for $n$, but it does not change the underlying $g(E)$ or the definition of $m_d^*$.\n\n**2. Conductivity Effective Mass ($m_c^*$ or $m_{cond}$)**\n\nLow-field conductivity is given by the Drude-like expression $\\sigma = n e \\mu$. The mobility $\\mu$ depends on the effective mass and scattering time $\\tau$. For an anisotropic band, the response to an electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is tensorial. In the principal axes of a single valley, the inverse effective mass tensor is:\n$$\\mathbf{M}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/m_l & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/m_t & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1/m_t \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe conductivity tensor for one valley is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{valley} = n_v e^2 \\tau \\mathbf{M}^{-1}$, where $n_v = n/g_v$ is the electron density per valley.\nThe total conductivity of the crystal is the sum of contributions from all valleys. For silicon ($g_v=6$), the valleys are oriented along the $\\pm x, \\pm y, \\pm z$ axes (crystal axes). We must average the conductivity tensors of all valleys. Due to the cubic symmetry of the crystal, the total conductivity tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ becomes isotropic, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\sigma \\mathbf{I}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix. The scalar conductivity $\\sigma$ is given by any of the diagonal elements, for example, $\\sigma_{xx}$.\n$$\\sigma = \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{total}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{g_v} \\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{valley,i})$$\nFor each valley, $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{valley,i}) = n_v e^2 \\tau \\left(\\frac{1}{m_l} + \\frac{2}{m_t}\\right)$.\nSo, $\\sigma = \\frac{1}{3} g_v \\left[ \\frac{n}{g_v} e^2 \\tau \\left(\\frac{1}{m_l} + \\frac{2}{m_t}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{n e^2 \\tau}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{m_l} + \\frac{2}{m_t}\\right)$.\nWe define the conductivity effective mass $m_c^*$ via the isotropic Drude formula $\\sigma = \\frac{n e^2 \\tau}{m_c^*}$. Comparing these expressions gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{m_c^*} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{m_l} + \\frac{2}{m_t}\\right)$$\nThis shows that $m_c^*$ is derived from a harmonic average of the inverse principal masses, averaged over the equivalent crystal directions.\nFor the silicon-like case:\n$$\\frac{1}{m_c^*} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{0.916\\,m_0} + \\frac{2}{0.190\\,m_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3m_0} \\left(1.0917 + 10.5263\\right) = \\frac{11.618}{3m_0} \\approx \\frac{3.873}{m_0}$$\n$$m_c^* = \\frac{m_0}{3.873} \\approx 0.258\\,m_0$$\nThe assumption of an energy-independent $\\tau$ and parabolic bands means this result holds regardless of whether the statistics are degenerate or non-degenerate. Transport involves an average over all carriers, and this effective mass represents the appropriate average for the entire electron population $n$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The equilibrium electron concentration is governed by a density-of-states effective mass equal to the geometric mean of the principal masses, and the low-field conductivity is governed by a conductivity effective mass defined by a directional harmonic average of the inverse principal masses. For silicon with the given parameters, the density-of-states effective mass is approximately $0.32\\,m_0$, and the conductivity effective mass is approximately $0.26\\,m_0$. Degenerate statistics change the occupation via Fermi-Dirac integrals but do not change which mass enters which quantity.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivations.\n-   $m_d^* = (m_l m_t^2)^{1/3}$ is the geometric mean.\n-   $1/m_c^* = \\frac{1}{3}(1/m_l + 2/m_t)$ is the directional harmonic average.\n-   Calculated values are $m_d^* \\approx 0.32\\,m_0$ and $m_c^* \\approx 0.26\\,m_0$.\n-   The role of the masses is independent of the statistics under the stated assumptions.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under degenerate conditions, the conductivity effective mass replaces the density-of-states mass in the effective density of states, because transport-weighted high-energy states dominate. Therefore, the equilibrium electron concentration is governed by the conductivity mass, yielding approximately $0.26\\,m_0$ in silicon, while transport is governed by the density-of-states mass, approximately $0.32\\,m_0$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The density of states is an intrinsic property of the band structure and is not altered by occupation statistics. It confuses and swaps the roles of the two effective masses.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. For any parabolic band, the density-of-states and conductivity effective masses are identical and equal to the transverse mass; thus both equilibrium concentration and conductivity are governed by $m_t$ for silicon.**\nThis is incorrect. The two masses are identical only for an isotropic band ($m_l = m_t$), not for any parabolic band. For silicon, $m_l \\neq m_t$, and our calculations show $m_d^* \\neq m_c^*$. Neither mass is equal to $m_t = 0.190\\,m_0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The mass entering transport is the geometric mean of the principal masses because it maximizes the number of available states, while the mass entering the effective density of states is the harmonic average because it weights inverse masses; for silicon this yields approximately $0.26\\,m_0$ for the density-of-states mass and $0.32\\,m_0$ for the conductivity mass.**\nThis statement incorrectly swaps the definitions and roles of the two masses. The geometric mean ($m_d^*$) governs the density of states, while the harmonic average ($m_c^*$) governs transport (conductivity). The numerical values are also assigned to the wrong quantities.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
