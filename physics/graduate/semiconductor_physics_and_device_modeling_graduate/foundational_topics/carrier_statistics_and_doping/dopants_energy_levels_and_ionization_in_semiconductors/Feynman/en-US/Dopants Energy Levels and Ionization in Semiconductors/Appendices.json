It describes the standard hydrogenic model for a shallow donor impurity in a semiconductor, which is a fundamental concept in solid-state physics.

The electron rest mass $m_{e}$ is replaced by the effective mass of the electron in the conduction band, $m^{\\ast}$.\n$2$. The permittivity of free space $\\epsilon_{0}$ is replaced by the total permittivity of the semiconductor medium, which is $\\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon_{r}$.\n\nApplying these substitutions to the hydrogen ground-state energy formula gives the ground-state energy $E$ of the donor electron:\n$$\nE = - \\frac{m^{\\ast} e^{4}}{32 \\pi^{2} (\\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon_{r})^{2} \\hbar^{2}} = - \\frac{m^{\\ast} e^{4}}{32 \\pi^{2} \\epsilon_{0}^{2} \\epsilon_{r}^{2} \\hbar^{2}}\n$$\nThe donor ground-state binding energy, $E_{B}$, is defined as the energy required to ionize the donor, which is the energy needed to move the electron from this bound state to the bottom of the conduction band (where its energy is taken as zero). Thus, $E_{B}$ is the magnitude of the ground-state energy $E$.\n$$\nE_{B} = |E| = \\frac{m^{\\ast} e^{4}}{32 \\pi^{2} \\epsilon_{0}^{2} \\epsilon_{r}^{2} \\hbar^{2}}\n$$\nThis expression shows the functional dependence of the binding energy on $m^{\\ast}$ and $\\epsilon_{r}$: $E_B \\propto m^{\\ast}$ and $E_B \\propto \\epsilon_{r}^{-2}$.\n\nNext, we must compute the differential fractional sensitivities, $S_{m^{\\ast}}$ and $S_{\\epsilon_{r}}$, defined as $S_{x} = \\partial (\\ln E_{B}) / \\partial (\\ln x)$.\nFirst, we take the natural logarithm of $E_{B}$:\n$$\n\\ln(E_{B}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{m^{\\ast} e^{4}}{32 \\pi^{2} \\epsilon_{0}^{2} \\epsilon_{r}^{2} \\hbar^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can expand this expression:\n$$\n\\ln(E_{B}) = \\ln(m^{\\ast}) + \\ln(e^{4}) - \\ln(32 \\pi^{2} \\epsilon_{0}^{2} \\hbar^{2}) - \\ln(\\epsilon_{r}^{2})\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(E_{B}) = \\ln(m^{\\ast}) - 2 \\ln(\\epsilon_{r}) + C\n$$\nwhere $C = \\ln(e^{4}) - \\ln(32 \\pi^{2} \\epsilon_{0}^{2} \\hbar^{2})$ is a constant with respect to $m^{\\ast}$ and $\\epsilon_{r}$.\n\nThe sensitivity to $m^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$\nS_{m^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln E_{B})}{\\partial (\\ln m^{\\ast})} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\ln m^{\\ast})} \\left[\\ln(m^{\\ast}) - 2 \\ln(\\epsilon_{r}) + C\\right]\n$$\nSince $\\ln(m^{\\ast})$ and $\\ln(\\epsilon_{r})$ are independent variables, the partial derivative with respect to $\\ln(m^{\\ast})$ treats $\\ln(\\epsilon_{r})$ as a constant.\n$$\nS_{m^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln m^{\\ast})}{\\partial (\\ln m^{\\ast})} - 0 + 0 = 1\n$$\nThe sensitivity to $\\epsilon_{r}$ is:\n$$\nS_{\\epsilon_{r}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln E_{B})}{\\partial (\\ln \\epsilon_{r})} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\ln \\epsilon_{r})} \\left[\\ln(m^{\\ast}) - 2 \\ln(\\epsilon_{r}) + C\\right]\n$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $\\ln(\\epsilon_{r})$ treats $\\ln(m^{\\ast})$ as a constant.\n$$\nS_{\\epsilon_{r}} = 0 - 2 \\frac{\\partial (\\ln \\epsilon_{r})}{\\partial (\\ln \\epsilon_{r})} + 0 = -2\n$$\nSo, we have $S_{m^{\\ast}} = 1$ and $S_{\\epsilon_{r}} = -2$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the first-order fractional change in $E_{B}$ due to small fractional changes in $m^{\\ast}$ and $\\epsilon_{r}$.

The problem specifies a set of conditions and assumptions that must be strictly followed.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental relationship between the hole concentration $p$, the valence band density of states $g_v(E)$, and the Fermi-Dirac distribution function $f(E)$. The concentration of holes is the integral over all available states in the valence band of the density of states multiplied by the probability that a state is not occupied by an electron (i.e., occupied by a hole). The probability of a hole occupying a state at energy $E$ is $1 - f(E)$.\n\nThe Fermi-Dirac distribution is given by:\n$$f(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

We can use a highly accurate approximation for the inverse Fermi-Dirac integral, such as the Joyce-Dixon approximation. For small values of $y = \\mathcal{F}_{1/2}(\\eta_p)$, the approximation is:\n$$\\eta_p(y) \\approx \\ln(y) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}y$$\nUsing $y = 0.0480769$:\n$$\\eta_p \\approx \\ln(0.0480769) + \\frac{0.0480769}{\\sqrt{8}} \\approx -3.0350 + \\frac{0.0480769}{2.8284} \\approx -3.0350 + 0.01700$$\n$$\\eta_p \\approx -3.0180$$\nThis value of $\\eta_p$ is more accurate than the M-B result.

The charge density is composed of contributions from mobile positive charges (holes, $p$), mobile negative charges (electrons, $n$), fixed positive charges (ionized donors, $N_D^+$), and fixed negative charges (ionized acceptors, $N_A^-$). The charge neutrality condition is stated as:\n$$ \\rho = q(p - n + N_D^+ - N_A^-) = 0 $$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge.

The concentration of ionized donors, $N_D^+$, is the total donor concentration $N_D$ multiplied by the probability that a donor state is empty (unoccupied), which is $1 - f_D(E_D)$:\n    $$ N_D^+(E_F) = N_D \\left[ 1 - f_D(E_D) \\right] = N_D \\left[ 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{g_D} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)} \\right] $$\n    Through algebraic simplification, this yields the standard expression for the ionized donor concentration:\n    $$ N_D^+(E_F) = \\frac{N_D}{1 + g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_D}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\n\nBy substituting these expressions for $p$, $n$, $N_A^-$, and $N_D^+$ into the charge neutrality equation, we obtain a single non-linear equation in the unknown variable $E_F$:\n$$ N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right) + \\frac{N_D}{1 + g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_D}{k_B T}\\right)} = N_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) + N_A $$\nTo solve this equation numerically, we define a function $f(E_F)$ whose root corresponds to the equilibrium Fermi level:\n$$ f(E_F) = p(E_F) - n(E_F) + N_D^+(E_F) - N_A = 0 $$\n$$ f(E_F) = N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right) - N_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) + \\frac{N_D}{1 + g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_D}{k_B T}\\right)} - N_A = 0 $$\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\n- $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $k_B = 8.617333262145 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}$, which gives $k_B T \\approx 0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $E_V = 0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $E_g = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, which implies $E_C = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- The donor level is at $E_D = E_C - 0.045\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.045\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.075\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- The donor degeneracy factor is $g_D = 2$\n- The effective densities of states are $N_c = 2.8 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $N_v = 1.04 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n\nThe function $f(E_F)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $E_F$ over the physically meaningful domain $[E_V, E_C]$. At the lower bound $E_F = E_V$, the hole term $p$ is large and positive, making $f(E_V)>0$. At the upper bound $E_F = E_C$, the electron term $n$ is large and negative, making $f(E_C)<0$. This guarantees the existence of a unique root within the bandgap. This root can be efficiently found using a numerical method like Brent's method.\n\nThe algorithmic approach is to:\n1.  Implement the function $f(E_F)$ in software.\n2.  For each test case defined by a pair of doping concentrations $(N_D, N_A)$, use a root-finding algorithm to solve $f(E_F)=0$ for $E_F$ within the search interval $[0, 1.12]\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n3.  The obtained root is the value of the Fermi level $E_F$ relative to the valence band edge $E_V=0$.\n4.  The results are collected, formatted to six decimal places, and presented in the required output format.\nThis procedure is implemented in the provided Python code.",
