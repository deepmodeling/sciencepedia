            "problem": "A nondegenerate, uniformly doped semiconductor at thermal equilibrium has shallow donors and acceptors with densities $N_D$ and $N_A$, respectively. Assume the donors and acceptors are fully ionized under the nondegenerate condition. The conduction-band edge energy is $E_c$, the valence-band edge energy is $E_v$, and the bandgap is $E_g = E_c - E_v$. The effective density of states in the conduction band is $N_c$ and in the valence band is $N_v$, both appropriate for the given temperature.

            "solution": "The user has provided a well-posed problem in semiconductor physics. The problem is scientifically grounded, free of contradictions, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The validation criteria are met.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the Fermi level, $E_F$, in a uniformly doped semiconductor at thermal equilibrium, starting from fundamental principles. Following this derivation, a numerical value for $E_F$ is to be computed using the provided material parameters.\n\nFirst, we establish the expressions for the electron concentration, $n$, and hole concentration, $p$, under the nondegenerate (Maxwell-Boltzmann) approximation. The electron concentration in the conduction band is given by the integral of the density of states, $g_c(E)$, multiplied by the probability of occupation, $f(E)$, over all energies in the conduction band:\n$$n = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} g_c(E) f(E) dE$$\nThe Fermi-Dirac distribution is $f(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)}$. The density of states in the conduction band is $g_c(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m_n^*}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\sqrt{E - E_c}$ for $E \\ge E_c$.\nUnder the nondegenerate assumption, the Fermi level $E_F$ is several $k_B T$ below the conduction band edge $E_c$, i.e., $E_c - E_F \\gg k_B T$. For any energy $E \\ge E_c$, the term $(E - E_F)$ is large and positive, so the exponential term in the denominator of $f(E)$ is much larger than $1$. Thus, the Fermi-Dirac distribution can be approximated by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:\n$$f(E) \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E-E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the integral for $n$:\n$$n = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m_n^*}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\sqrt{E-E_c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E-E_F}{k_B T}\\right) dE$$\nThis integral can be solved by a change of variables, but its result is standardly expressed in terms of the effective density of states in the conduction band, $N_c$:\n$$n = N_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $N_c = 2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_n^* k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2}$.\n\nSimilarly, the hole concentration in the valence band is given by the integral of the density of states, $g_v(E)$, multiplied by the probability of a state being empty (i.e., occupied by a hole), $1-f(E)$:\n$$p = \\int_{-\\infty}^{E_v} g_v(E) [1-f(E)] dE$$\nThe probability of a hole is $1 - f(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F-E}{k_B T}\\right)}$. The non-degenerate assumption for holes requires $E_F - E_v \\gg k_B T$. This allows the approximation:\n$$1 - f(E) \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F-E}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe integration yields an expression analogous to that for electrons:\n$$p = N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_v}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $N_v = 2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_p^* k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2}$ is the effective density of states in the valence band.\n\nThe problem specifies the energy reference $E_v = 0$, which implies $E_c = E_g$. The carrier concentration expressions become:\n$$n = N_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$p = N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we establish the law of mass action by taking the product of the electron and hole concentrations:\n$$np = \\left(N_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) \\left(N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$np = N_c N_v \\exp\\left(\\frac{-E_g + E_F - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) = N_c N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe product $np$ is independent of the Fermi level $E_F$ and depends only on temperature and material properties. This product is equal to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i^2$.\n$$np = n_i^2 = N_c N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nThe final principle required is charge neutrality. The total positive charge density must equal the total negative charge density. The species are ionized donors ($N_D^+$), holes ($p$), ionized acceptors ($N_A^-$), and electrons ($n$).\n$$p + N_D^+ = n + N_A^-$$\nThe problem states that all shallow dopants are fully ionized, so $N_D^+ = N_D$ and $N_A^- = N_A$. The charge neutrality condition simplifies to:\n$$p + N_D = n + N_A$$\n$$n - p = N_D - N_A$$\n\nTo solve for the carrier concentrations, we substitute $p = n_i^2/n$ into the charge neutrality equation:\n$$n - \\frac{n_i^2}{n} = N_D - N_A$$\nMultiplying by $n$ (since $n \\neq 0$) gives a quadratic equation for $n$:\n$$n^2 - (N_D - N_A)n - n_i^2 = 0$$\nSolving this quadratic equation for $n$ yields:\n$$n = \\frac{(N_D - N_A) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nSince the electron concentration $n$ must be a positive quantity, we select the positive root:\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_D - N_A}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}$$\n\nWith the expression for $n$, we can now find the Fermi level $E_F$. From the equation for electron concentration:\n$$n = N_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{n}{N_c} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{n}{N_c}\\right) = -\\frac{E_g - E_F}{k_B T}$$\n$$k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_c}{n}\\right) = E_g - E_F$$\n$$E_F = E_g - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_c}{n}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $E_F$ using the given parameters.\nThe thermal energy at $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is:\n$$k_B T = (8.61733 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K})(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nWe first calculate $n_i^2$:\n$$n_i^2 = N_c N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe exponent is $\\frac{E_g}{k_B T} = \\frac{1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}} \\approx 43.3235$.\n$$n_i^2 = (2.80 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}})(1.04 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}) \\exp(-43.3235)$$\n$$n_i^2 \\approx (2.912 \\times 10^{38}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-6}})(1.545 \\times 10^{-19}) \\approx 4.500 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-6}}$$\n\nThe net doping concentration is:\n$$N_D - N_A = (2.00 \\times 10^{16} - 5.00 \\times 10^{15})\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 1.50 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$$\nSince $N_D > N_A$, the semiconductor is n-type.\n\nNow we calculate the electron concentration $n$:\n$$n = \\frac{1.50 \\times 10^{16}}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1.50 \\times 10^{16}}{2}\\right)^2 + 4.500 \\times 10^{19}}$$\n$$n = (7.50 \\times 10^{15}) + \\sqrt{(5.625 \\times 10^{31}) + (0.0045 \\times 10^{31})}$$\n$$n = (7.50 \\times 10^{15}) + \\sqrt{5.6295 \\times 10^{31}} = (7.50 \\times 10^{15}) + (7.5030 \\times 10^{15})$$\n$$n \\approx 1.5003 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate $E_F$:\n$$E_F = E_g - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_c}{n}\\right)$$\n$$E_F = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV} - (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{2.80 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}}{1.5003 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}}\\right)$$\n$$E_F = 1.12 - (0.025852) \\ln(1866.3)$$\n$$E_F = 1.12 - (0.025852)(7.5317)$$\n$$E_F = 1.12 - 0.19471 \\approx 0.92529\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $E_F = 0.9253\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nAs a final verification step, we check the validity of the nondegenerate assumption.\nFor electrons: $E_c - E_F = E_g - E_F = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.9253\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.1947\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\nFor holes: $E_F - E_v = 0.9253\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.9253\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe thermal energy is $k_B T \\approx 0.0259\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\nA common criterion for the nondegenerate approximation is that the energy difference must be greater than $3 k_B T$, which is approximately $0.0776\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\nSince $0.1947\\,\\mathrm{eV} \\gg 3k_B T$ and $0.9253\\,\\mathrm{eV} \\gg 3k_B T$, the assumption is fully justified by the result.\nThe Fermi level is located at $0.9253\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ above the valence band edge.",

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard, solvable problem in semiconductor physics.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first establishing the necessary mathematical formulations for carrier and trap densities, then constructing the charge neutrality equation, and finally solving this equation for the equilibrium Fermi level.\n\n**1. Carrier and Trap Statistics**\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the non-degenerate (Maxwell-Boltzmann) approximation for free carriers and the Fermi-Dirac distribution for trap occupancy.\n\nThe equilibrium electron concentration $n_0$ in the conduction band is given by:\n$$n_0 = N_C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $N_C$ is the effective density of states in the conduction band, $E_C$ is the conduction band edge energy, $E_F$ is the Fermi level, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe equilibrium hole concentration $p_0$ in the valence band is given by:\n$$p_0 = N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $N_V$ is the effective density of states in the valence band and $E_V$ is the valence band edge energy.

The occupancy of these traps is governed by the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, $f(E_t)$.

Charge Neutrality Condition**\n\nThe principle of electrical neutrality requires that the total positive charge density equals the total negative charge density.\n\nThe positive charges in the semiconductor are holes (density $p_0$, charge $+q$) and ionized donors (density $N_D^+$, charge $+q$).\nThe negative charges are electrons (density $n_0$, charge $-q$) and occupied traps (density $n_t$, charge $-q$). The problem states that an occupied trap carries a charge of $-q$ and is neutral when empty. It also states there are no acceptors.\n\nThe charge neutrality equation is thus:\n$$q p_0 + q N_D^+ = q n_0 + q n_t$$\nDividing by the elementary charge $q$, we get the condition for the densities:\n$$p_0 + N_D^+ = n_0 + n_t$$\nThe problem states that the shallow donors are fully ionized at $T=300\\,\\text{K}$, so $N_D^+ = N_D$.\nSubstituting the expression for the occupied trap density $n_t$, we arrive at the charge neutrality condition that explicitly includes the deep-level occupancy:\n$$p_0 + N_D = n_0 + N_t \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_t - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)}$$\nThis is the first part of the derivation requested.\n\n**3.

This can be related to the steady-state carrier concentrations $n$ and $p$ by the law of mass action for non-equilibrium conditions:\n$$np = n_i^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{F_n - F_p}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nRearranging for the splitting gives:\n$$F_n - F_p = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{np}{n_i^2}\\right)$$\nTherefore, the primary task is to determine the steady-state concentrations $n$ and $p$.\n\nFirst, we determine the equilibrium carrier concentrations (with $G=0$). Since the material is acceptor-doped and $N_A \\gg n_i$, it is p-type. Assuming full ionization and charge neutrality ($p_0 = N_A^{-} + n_0 \\approx N_A$), the equilibrium hole concentration is:\n$$p_0 \\approx N_A = 1.0\\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nThe equilibrium electron concentration is then found from the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$n_0 = \\frac{n_i^2}{p_0} = \\frac{(1.0\\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})^2}{1.0\\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} = 1.0\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nUnder steady-state illumination, the net recombination rate $R$ must equal the generation rate $G$. Recombination is dominated by the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) process. The SRH net recombination rate $R_{SRH}$ is given by:\n$$R_{SRH} = \\frac{pn - n_i^2}{\\tau_{p0}(n+n_1) + \\tau_{n0}(p+p_1)}$$\nThe parameters $n_1$ and $p_1$ are the carrier concentrations if the Fermi level were at the trap energy level $E_t$. Since the trap level is at midgap ($E_t = E_i$), we have:\n$$n_1 = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_t - E_i}{k_B T}\\right) = n_i$$\n$$p_1 = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_t}{k_B T}\\right) = n_i$$\nThe characteristic lifetimes $\\tau_{n0}$ and $\\tau_{p0}$ are defined as:\n$$\\tau_{n0} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_n v_{\\text{th}} N_t} = \\frac{1}{(1.5\\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2)(1.0\\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,s}^{-1})(5.0\\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})} = \\frac{1}{7.5\\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 1.333\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$\\tau_{p0} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_p v_{\\text{th}} N_t} = \\frac{1}{(3.0\\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2)(1.0\\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,s}^{-1})(5.0\\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})} = \\frac{1}{1.5\\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 6.667\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nUnder illumination, excess carriers are generated. Due to quasi-neutrality, $\\Delta n = \\Delta p$. Let's denote this excess concentration by $\\delta$. The total concentrations are:\n$$n = n_0 + \\delta$$\n$$p = p_0 + \\delta$$\nSubstituting these into the SRH rate equation along with $n_1=p_1=n_i$ and setting $R_{SRH}=G$:\n$$G = \\frac{(n_0+\\delta)(p_0+\\delta) - n_i^2}{\\tau_{p0}(n_0+\\delta+n_i) + \\tau_{n0}(p_0+\\delta+n_i)}$$\nExpanding the numerator, and recalling that $n_0 p_0 = n_i^2$:\n$$(n_0+\\delta)(p_0+\\delta) - n_i^2 = n_0 p_0 + n_0 \\delta + p_0 \\delta + \\delta^2 - n_i^2 = \\delta(n_0+p_0+\\delta)$$\nSo, the equation for $\\delta$ is:\n$$G = \\frac{\\delta(n_0+p_0+\\delta)}{\\tau_{p0}(n_0+n_i+\\delta) + \\tau_{n0}(p_0+n_i+\\delta)}$$\nThis can be rearranged into a quadratic equation for $\\delta$:\n$$G[\\tau_{p0}(n_0+n_i) + \\tau_{n0}(p_0+n_i) + (\\tau_{p0}+\\tau_{n0})\\delta] = \\delta^2 + (n_0+p_0)\\delta$$\n$$\\delta^2 + [n_0+p_0 - G(\\tau_{p0}+\\tau_{n0})]\\delta - G[\\tau_{p0}(n_0+n_i) + \\tau_{n0}(p_0+n_i)] = 0$$\nThis is of the form $a\\delta^2 + b\\delta + c = 0$.
