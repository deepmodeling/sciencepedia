            "introduction": "Line-Edge Roughness (LER) and Line-Width Roughness (LWR) are key metrics describing the fidelity of patterned features in semiconductor manufacturing. While LER quantifies the variation of a single edge, LWR measures the variation in the feature's width, which is determined by the positions of both its edges. This exercise establishes the fundamental mathematical relationship between these two metrics, demonstrating how the statistical correlation between the two edges is a critical factor in determining the final line-width uniformity.

According to the Wiener–Khinchin theorem, the autocorrelation function is the inverse Fourier transform of the PSD.

The PSD is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function: $S_{W}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C_{W}(x)\\,\\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k x)\\,dx$. Evaluating this at $k=0$ gives:\n$$\nS_{W}(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C_{W}(x)\\,dx\n$$\nThe problem states that the fitted PSDs are even functions of $k$. The inverse Fourier transform of a real and even function is also real and even. Therefore, $C_{W}(x)$ must be an even function, i.e., $C_{W}(x) = C_{W}(-x)$. This allows us to write the integral over the entire real axis as twice the integral over the positive half-axis:\n$$\nS_{W}(0) = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C_{W}(x)\\,dx\n$$\nRearranging this gives an expression for the integral in the definition of $\\ell_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} C_{W}(x)\\,dx = \\frac{1}{2} S_{W}(0)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $\\ell_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\ell_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} S_{W}(0)}{C_{W}(0)}\n$$\nWe have already calculated the denominator $C_{W}(0) = \\sigma_{LWR}^{2} = 2(1-\\rho)(A_{1}+A_{2})$.\nWe now need to find the numerator, $S_{W}(0)$. We use the expression $S_{W}(k) = 2(1-\\rho)S_{L}(k)$ and evaluate it at $k=0$:\n$$\nS_{W}(0) = 2(1-\\rho) S_{L}(0)\n$$\nFrom the given functional form of $S_{L}(k)$:\n$$\nS_{L}(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{2 A_{i}\\,\\xi_{i}}{1+(0 \\cdot \\xi_{i})^{2}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} 2 A_{i}\\,\\xi_{i} = 2(A_{1}\\xi_{1} + A_{2}\\xi_{2})\n$$\nSo, $S_{W}(0) = 2(1-\\rho) \\cdot 2(A_{1}\\xi_{1} + A_{2}\\xi_{2}) = 4(1-\\rho)(A_{1}\\xi_{1} + A_{2}\\xi_{2})$.\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $S_{W}(0)$ and $C_{W}(0)$ into the formula for $\\ell_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\ell_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 4(1-\\rho)(A_{1}\\xi_{1} + A_{2}\\xi_{2}) \\right]}{2(1-\\rho)(A_{1}+A_{2})} = \\frac{2(1-\\rho)(A_{1}\\xi_{1} + A_{2}\\xi_{2})}{2(1-\\rho)(A_{1}+A_{2})} = \\frac{A_{1}\\xi_{1} + A_{2}\\xi_{2}}{A_{1}+A_{2}}\n$$\nThis result shows that the effective correlation length is a weighted average of the individual component correlation lengths, where the weights are their respective amplitudes $A_{i}$.
