This exercise guides you through a first-principles derivation of the variability in a p-n junction's built-in potential, $V_{bi}$.

The built-in potential is given by $V_{bi} = (k T/q)\\,\\ln\\!\\big(N_{A} N_{D}/n_{i}^{2}\\big)$, where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier density. Due to random dopant fluctuations (RDF), the realized acceptor and donor densities in the neighborhood of the metallurgical junction are random and can be modeled as coarse-grained estimators $\\hat{N}_{A}$ and $\\hat{N}_{D}$ formed by counting dopant atoms inside two effective sampling volumes $V_{A}$ (on the $p$-side) and $V_{D}$ (on the $n$-side), respectively, and dividing by those volumes.

In this regime:\n- The linear (delta-method) propagation fails because it implicitly assumes a smooth mapping in a neighborhood where the random variables remain in the interior of the domain. Zero counts place mass at the boundary where $\\ln$ is undefined, invalidating the linear approximation.\n- Even conditioning on positive counts, the curvature of $\\ln(\\cdot)$ induces higher-order corrections. A second-order Taylor expansion of $\\ln \\hat{N}$ about its mean shows that, for $X \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)$ with large $\\lambda$, $\\mathbb{E}[\\ln X] \\approx \\ln \\lambda - \\frac{1}{2 \\lambda} + \\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^{-2})$ and $\\mathrm{var}(\\ln X) \\approx \\lambda^{-1} + \\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^{-2})$, indicating bias and variance corrections of order $\\lambda^{-1}$ and $\\lambda^{-2}$, respectively. Translating to densities, $\\lambda = N V$.\n- A mathematically consistent regularization is to define a pseudo-count, e.g., replace $X$ by $X + \\alpha$ with a small $\\alpha > 0$ (such as $\\alpha = 1$), so that $\\ln(\\hat{N})$ is always defined. This shifts the effective intensity to $\\lambda + \\alpha$ and regularizes the singularity at zero at the cost of an explicit, controllable bias. Alternatively, one can condition on $X>0$ and work with the conditional distribution, replacing expectations by $\\mathbb{E}[\\cdot \\mid X>0]$, which removes the singularity but modifies both mean and variance.\n\nImportantly, in all such regularizations, the leading-order variance contribution for large $N V$ remains $\\sim 1/(N V)$, which is exactly the term captured by the derived expression. The breakdown occurs when $N_{A} V_{A}$ or $N_{D} V_{D}$ is not large, where higher-order terms and zero-count handling dominate and the simple square-root law underestimates the true variability and fails to describe the heavy tail introduced by possible near-zero realizations of $\\hat{N}$.",

We must derive all expressions from the provided first principles.\n\n**1. Preliminary Calculations**\nThe silicon permittivity is $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si,rel}} \\varepsilon_{0}$ and the oxide permittivity is $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox,rel}} \\varepsilon_{0}$. The oxide capacitance per unit area is $C_{\\mathrm{ox}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} / t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$. The thermal voltage is $V_T = k_B T / q$. The Fermi potential in the p-type bulk is given by $\\phi_F = V_T \\ln(N_A / n_i)$. The surface potential at threshold is specified as $\\psi_s = 2\\phi_F$.\n\n**2. Continuum Model Threshold Voltage ($V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{cont}}$)**\nWe start with the one-dimensional Poisson's equation in the semiconductor for $x > 0$ (where $x=0$ is the Si/SiO$_2$ interface):\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si}}} $$\nIn the depletion approximation, the charge density $\\rho(x)$ is due to ionized acceptors, so $\\rho(x) = -qN_A$ for $0 \\le x \\le W_{\\mathrm{dep}}$ and $\\rho(x) = 0$ for $x > W_{\\mathrm{dep}}$.\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si}}} \\quad (0 \\le x \\le W_{\\mathrm{dep}}) $$\nIntegrating once with the boundary condition that the electric field $E = -d\\psi/dx$ is zero at the edge of the depletion region, $x=W_{\\mathrm{dep}}$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\psi}{dx} = \\frac{qN_A}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si}}}(x - W_{\\mathrm{dep}}) $$\nIntegrating a second time with the boundary condition that the potential $\\psi=0$ in the neutral bulk (i.e., $\\psi(W_{\\mathrm{dep}}) = 0$):\n$$ \\psi(x) = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si}}}(x - W_{\\mathrm{dep}})^2 $$\nThe surface potential $\\psi_s$ is $\\psi(0)$. Setting this equal to the threshold condition $\\psi_s = 2\\phi_F$:\n$$ \\psi_s = 2\\phi_F = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si}}}(W_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}})^2 $$\nSolving for the continuum depletion width $W_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}}$ at threshold:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si}}\\phi_F}{qN_A}} $$\nThe total depletion charge per unit area is $Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}} = -qN_A W_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}} = -\\sqrt{4qN_A\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si}}\\phi_F}$.\nThe gate voltage $V_G$ is composed of the voltage drop across the oxide, $V_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, and the surface potential $\\psi_s$, since $V_{\\mathrm{fb}}=0$.\n$$ V_G = V_{\\mathrm{ox}} + \\psi_s $$\nBy Gauss's law at the gate electrode, the charge per unit area on the gate, $Q_G$, is related to the oxide voltage by $V_{\\mathrm{ox}} = Q_G/C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$. At threshold, charge neutrality requires $Q_G + Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}} + Q_{\\mathrm{inv}} \\approx 0$. In the depletion approximation at the onset of inversion, the inversion charge $Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}$ is negligible, so $Q_G \\approx -Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}}$. Thus, $V_{\\mathrm{ox}} = -Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}}/C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$.\nThe continuum threshold voltage is then:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{cont}} = -\\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}}}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + \\psi_s = \\frac{\\sqrt{4qN_A\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si}}\\phi_F}}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + 2\\phi_F $$\n\n**3. Discrete Model Median Threshold Voltage ($V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{disc,med}}$)**\nIn the discrete model, the number of dopants $N$ within the volume $A \\times W_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}}$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$:\n$$ N \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\lambda = N_A A W_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}} $$\nFor a specific device with $N$ dopants, the total depletion charge is $-Nq$. The depletion charge per unit area is $Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{disc}}(N) = -Nq/A$.\nFollowing the same charge balance logic, the discrete threshold voltage for a device with $N$ dopants is:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{disc}}(N) = -\\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{disc}}(N)}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + \\psi_s = \\frac{Nq}{AC_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + 2\\phi_F $$\nThis function is monotonically increasing in $N$. Therefore, the median of the distribution of $V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{disc}}(N)$ is found by evaluating the function at the median of the distribution of $N$. Let $N_{\\mathrm{med}} = \\text{median}(N)$.\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{disc,med}} = V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{disc}}(N_{\\mathrm{med}}) = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{med}}q}{AC_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + 2\\phi_F $$\n$N_{\\mathrm{med}}$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Poisson distribution satisfies $P(N \\le k) \\ge 0.5$. It can be computed using the percent point function (inverse CDF) at probability $0.5$.\n\n**4. Smoothing Bias ($b$)**\nThe smoothing bias is the difference:\n$$ b = V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{cont}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{disc,med}} $$\n$$ b = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{4qN_A\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si}}\\phi_F}}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + 2\\phi_F\\right) - \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{med}}q}{AC_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + 2\\phi_F\\right) $$\nThe $2\\phi_F$ terms cancel. We substitute the expression for the depletion charge, noting that $\\sqrt{4qN_A\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si}}\\phi_F} = qN_A W_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}}$, and use the definition of $\\lambda$:\n$$ qN_A W_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}} = \\frac{q (N_A A W_{\\mathrm{dep}}^{\\mathrm{cont}})}{A} = \\frac{q \\lambda}{A} $$\nThis simplifies the bias expression significantly:\n$$ b = \\frac{q\\lambda/A}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} - \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{med}}q}{AC_{\\mathrm{ox}}} = \\frac{q}{AC_{\\mathrm{ox}}}(\\lambda - N_{\\mathrm{med}}) $$\nThis elegant final expression directly relates the bias to the difference between the mean and median of the dopant count distribution.\n\n**Computational Algorithm**\nFor each test case with a given area $A$:\n1.

This practice explores how different physical mechanisms create unique, bias-dependent signatures in the device's current-voltage characteristics. By deriving the variance of the drain current as a function of gate and drain bias, you will develop a powerful diagnostic technique to experimentally separate the impacts of RDF and MGG, a method central to modern technology characterization .",

Treat each source as producing zero-mean random perturbations to long-channel parameters with the following physically motivated signatures:\n- RDF induces a random threshold voltage shift $\\delta V_{T}^{R}$ and a random drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) factor perturbation $\\delta \\lambda^{R}$ via stochastic variations in depletion charge and electrostatic coupling. Assume $\\delta V_{T}^{R}$ and $\\delta \\lambda^{R}$ are independent of Metal Gate Granularity and have variances $\\sigma_{R}^{2}$ and $\\sigma_{\\lambda}^{2}$, respectively.\n- MGG induces a random effective metal work function shift that maps to a threshold voltage shift $\\delta V_{T}^{M}$ with variance $\\sigma_{M}^{2}$ but negligibly perturbs the DIBL factor, so $\\delta \\lambda^{M} \\approx 0$.\n\nAssume that RDF and MGG are statistically independent, so the total threshold perturbation is $\\delta V_{T}=\\delta V_{T}^{R}+\\delta V_{T}^{M}$ with variance $\\sigma_{V_{T}}^{2}=\\sigma_{R}^{2}+\\sigma_{M}^{2}$, and the total DIBL perturbation is $\\delta \\lambda=\\delta \\lambda^{R}$ with variance $\\sigma_{\\lambda}^{2}$.

Using the weak inversion result, propose a two-point diagnostic that separates the RDF signature (through $\\sigma_{\\lambda}^{2}$) from the overall threshold variability (through $\\sigma_{V_{T}}^{2}$) by measuring $\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln I_{D}]$ at a fixed $V_{G}$ and two distinct drain biases $V_{D1}$ and $V_{D2}$.

The concepts of Random Dopant Fluctuations (RDF) and Metal Gate Granularity (MGG) are established, dominant sources of statistical variability in modern CMOS technology. The expressions for drain current in weak and strong inversion are standard compact models. The use of first-order propagation of uncertainty is a standard and appropriate technique for analyzing the impact of small perturbations. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary physical models, parameter definitions, and statistical assumptions required to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. The crucial assumption of statistical independence between different sources ($\\delta V_T^M$, $\\delta\\lambda^R$), and within the main variability components ($\\delta V_T$, $\\delta\\lambda$), is explicitly stated or strongly implied, which prevents ambiguity. This structure is common in device physics problems to make the analysis tractable. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the expressions requested in tasks $1$ and $2$, and then using the result of task $1$ to solve task $3$.\n\n**1. Derivation of $\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln I_{D}]$ in Weak Inversion**\n\nIn the weak inversion regime, the drain current $I_D$ is given by:\n$$I_{D}=I_{S}\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{V_{G}-V_{T}-\\lambda V_{D}}{nU_{T}}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of this expression yields:\n$$\\ln I_{D} = \\ln I_{S} + \\frac{V_{G}-V_{T}-\\lambda V_{D}}{nU_{T}}$$\nThe parameters $V_{T}$ and $\\lambda$ are random variables with mean values $\\langle V_{T} \\rangle$ and $\\langle \\lambda \\rangle$ and small, zero-mean perturbations $\\delta V_{T}$ and $\\delta \\lambda$, respectively, such that $V_{T} = \\langle V_{T} \\rangle + \\delta V_{T}$ and $\\lambda = \\langle \\lambda \\rangle + \\delta \\lambda$.\nThe perturbation in $\\ln I_{D}$ to first order is:\n$$\\delta(\\ln I_{D}) = \\ln I_{D} - \\langle \\ln I_{D} \\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\partial(\\ln I_{D})}{\\partial V_{T}}\\delta V_{T} + \\frac{\\partial(\\ln I_{D})}{\\partial \\lambda}\\delta \\lambda$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial(\\ln I_{D})}{\\partial V_{T}} = -\\frac{1}{nU_{T}}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial(\\ln I_{D})}{\\partial \\lambda} = -\\frac{V_{D}}{nU_{T}}$$\nThus, the perturbation is:\n$$\\delta(\\ln I_{D}) \\approx -\\frac{1}{nU_{T}}\\delta V_{T} - \\frac{V_{D}}{nU_{T}}\\delta \\lambda = -\\frac{1}{nU_{T}}(\\delta V_{T} + V_{D}\\delta \\lambda)$$\nThe variance of $\\ln I_{D}$ is the expectation of the square of its perturbation, since the perturbations are zero-mean:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln I_{D}] = \\mathrm{E}[(\\delta(\\ln I_{D}))^{2}] = \\mathrm{E}\\left[ \\left(-\\frac{1}{nU_{T}}(\\delta V_{T} + V_{D}\\delta \\lambda)\\right)^{2} \\right]$$\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln I_{D}] = \\frac{1}{(nU_{T})^{2}} \\mathrm{E}[(\\delta V_{T} + V_{D}\\delta \\lambda)^{2}] = \\frac{1}{(nU_{T})^{2}} \\mathrm{E}[\\delta V_{T}^{2} + 2V_{D}\\delta V_{T}\\delta \\lambda + V_{D}^{2}\\delta \\lambda^{2}]$$\nUsing the linearity of expectation:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln I_{D}] = \\frac{1}{(nU_{T})^{2}} (\\mathrm{E}[\\delta V_{T}^{2}] + 2V_{D}\\mathrm{E}[\\delta V_{T}\\delta \\lambda] + V_{D}^{2}\\mathrm{E}[\\delta \\lambda^{2}])$$\nThe term $\\mathrm{E}[\\delta V_{T}^{2}]$ is the variance of the total threshold voltage shift, $\\sigma_{V_{T}}^{2}$. The term $\\mathrm{E}[\\delta \\lambda^{2}]$ is the variance of the DIBL factor, $\\sigma_{\\lambda}^{2}$. The covariance term is $\\mathrm{E}[\\delta V_{T}\\delta \\lambda] = \\mathrm{E}[(\\delta V_{T}^{R}+\\delta V_{T}^{M})(\\delta \\lambda^{R})]$ since $\\delta\\lambda = \\delta\\lambda^{R}$. This expands to $\\mathrm{E}[\\delta V_{T}^{R}\\delta \\lambda^{R}] + \\mathrm{E}[\\delta V_{T}^{M}\\delta \\lambda^{R}]$. As MGG and RDF are independent, $\\mathrm{E}[\\delta V_{T}^{M}\\delta \\lambda^{R}] = \\mathrm{E}[\\delta V_{T}^{M}]\\mathrm{E}[\\delta \\lambda^{R}] = 0 \\times 0 = 0$. The problem does not provide a correlation coefficient between $\\delta V_{T}^{R}$ and $\\delta \\lambda^{R}$. In the context of such separation problems, if not specified, this correlation is assumed to be zero for analytical tractability. Hence, we assume $\\mathrm{E}[\\delta V_{T}\\delta \\lambda] = 0$.\nThe expression for the variance simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln I_{D}](V_{D}) = \\frac{1}{(nU_{T})^{2}} (\\sigma_{V_{T}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\lambda}^{2}V_{D}^{2})$$\nThis completes the first task.\n\n**2. Derivation of $\\mathrm{Var}[\\delta I_{D}/I_{D}]$ in Strong Inversion (Linear)**\n\nFor the linear region in strong inversion, the current is $I_{D} \\approx K(V_{G}-V_{T}-\\lambda V_{D})V_{D}$. Let $I_{D,0}$ be the mean current, corresponding to mean values $\\langle V_{T} \\rangle$ and $\\langle \\lambda \\rangle$.\nThe first-order perturbation $\\delta I_{D}$ is:\n$$\\delta I_{D} \\approx \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{T}}\\delta V_{T} + \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial \\lambda}\\delta \\lambda$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{T}} = -KV_{D}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial \\lambda} = -KV_{D}^{2}$$\nThe relative current perturbation is $\\delta I_{D} / I_{D,0}$:\n$$\\frac{\\delta I_{D}}{I_{D,0}} \\approx \\frac{-KV_{D}\\delta V_{T} - KV_{D}^{2}\\delta \\lambda}{K(V_{G}-\\langle V_{T} \\rangle - \\langle \\lambda \\rangle V_{D})V_{D}} = -\\frac{\\delta V_{T} + V_{D}\\delta \\lambda}{V_{G}-\\langle V_{T} \\rangle - \\langle \\lambda \\rangle V_{D}}$$\nThe denominator is the effective gate overdrive voltage. The variance of this relative perturbation is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\frac{\\delta I_{D}}{I_{D}}\\right] = \\mathrm{E}\\left[\\left( \\frac{\\delta I_{D}}{I_{D,0}} \\right)^{2}\\right] = \\frac{1}{(V_{G}-\\langle V_{T} \\rangle - \\langle \\lambda \\rangle V_{D})^{2}} \\mathrm{E}[(\\delta V_{T} + V_{D}\\delta \\lambda)^{2}]$$\nUsing the same reasoning as for the weak inversion case (uncorrelated $\\delta V_T$ and $\\delta \\lambda$):\n$$\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\frac{\\delta I_{D}}{I_{D}}\\right] = \\frac{\\sigma_{V_{T}}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\lambda}^{2}V_{D}^{2}}{(V_{G}-\\langle V_{T} \\rangle - \\langle \\lambda \\rangle V_{D})^{2}}$$\nThis completes the second task.\n\n**3. Separation of RDF Signature using the Two-Point Diagnostic**\n\nFrom task $1$, the variance of $\\ln I_{D}$ in weak inversion is a linear function of $V_{D}^{2}$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln I_{D}] = A + B V_{D}^{2}$$\nwhere the intercept $A$ and slope $B$ are given by:\n$$A = \\frac{\\sigma_{V_{T}}^{2}}{(nU_{T})^{2}}$$\n$$B = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\lambda}^{2}}{(nU_{T})^{2}}$$\nThe problem defines the RDF-separation metric $S$ as the ratio of the slope $B$ to the intercept $A$ of this linear relationship:\n$$S = \\frac{B}{A} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\lambda}^{2} / (nU_{T})^{2}}{\\sigma_{V_{T}}^{2} / (nU_{T})^{2}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\lambda}^{2}}{\\sigma_{V_{T}}^{2}}$$\nWe are given two measurements of the variance at two distinct drain biases, $V_{D1}$ and $V_{D2}$:\n$$\\mathcal{S}_{1} = \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln I_{D}](V_{D1}) = A + B V_{D1}^{2}$$\n$$\\mathcal{S}_{2} = \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln I_{D}](V_{D2}) = A + B V_{D2}^{2}$$\nThis is a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns, $A$ and $B$. To solve for $A$ and $B$, we first subtract the first equation from the second to find $B$:\n$$\\mathcal{S}_{2} - \\mathcal{S}_{1} = (A + B V_{D2}^{2}) - (A + B V_{D1}^{2}) = B(V_{D2}^{2} - V_{D1}^{2})$$\n$$B = \\frac{\\mathcal{S}_{2} - \\mathcal{S}_{1}}{V_{D2}^{2} - V_{D1}^{2}}$$\nNext, we solve for $A$ by substituting this expression for $B$ into the first equation:\n$$A = \\mathcal{S}_{1} - B V_{D1}^{2} = \\mathcal{S}_{1} - \\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{S}_{2} - \\mathcal{S}_{1}}{V_{D2}^{2} - V_{D1}^{2}}\\right)V_{D1}^{2}$$\nTo simplify $A$, we find a common denominator:\n$$A = \\frac{\\mathcal{S}_{1}(V_{D2}^{2} - V_{D1}^{2}) - (\\mathcal{S}_{2} - \\mathcal{S}_{1})V_{D1}^{2}}{V_{D2}^{2} - V_{D1}^{2}} = \\frac{\\mathcal{S}_{1}V_{D2}^{2} - \\mathcal{S}_{1}V_{D1}^{2} - \\mathcal{S}_{2}V_{D1}^{2} + \\mathcal{S}_{1}V_{D1}^{2}}{V_{D2}^{2} - V_{D1}^{2}}$$\n$$A = \\frac{\\mathcal{S}_{1}V_{D2}^{2} - \\mathcal{S}_{2}V_{D1}^{2}}{V_{D2}^{2} - V_{D1}^{2}}$$\nFinally, we compute the desired metric $S = B/A$:\n$$S = \\frac{\\frac{\\mathcal{S}_{2} - \\mathcal{S}_{1}}{V_{D2}^{2} - V_{D1}^{2}}}{\\frac{\\mathcal{S}_{1}V_{D2}^{2} - \\mathcal{S}_{2}V_{D1}^{2}}{V_{D2}^{2} - V_{D1}^{2}}}$$\nThe common denominator $(V_{D2}^{2} - V_{D1}^{2})$ cancels, as $V_{D1} \\neq V_{D2}$, yielding the final expression for $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{\\mathcal{S}_{2} - \\mathcal{S}_{1}}{\\mathcal{S}_{1}V_{D2}^{2} - \\mathcal{S}_{2}V_{D1}^{2}}$$\nThis expression depends only on the measured quantities $\\mathcal{S}_{1}$, $\\mathcal{S}_{2}$ and the corresponding biases $V_{D1}$, $V_{D2}$, as required.",
