It is a standard application of a well-established physical model.\n-   **Action**: Proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe rate of a thermally activated process, $R$, is described by the Arrhenius equation, where the rate is proportional to an exponential factor involving the activation energy, $W$, and the thermal energy, $k_B T$:\n$$R \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{W}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the defect creation rate, $R_{cr}$, follows this behavior, and the activation energy, $W(E)$, is a function of the electric field $E$:\n$$W(E) = W_0 - \\alpha E$$\nSubstituting this expression for the activation energy into the Arrhenius relation for the defect creation rate gives:\n$$R_{cr}(E) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{W_0 - \\alpha E}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe exponential term can be separated:\n$$R_{cr}(E) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{W_0}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha E}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe problem defines the time-to-failure, $\\mathrm{TTF}(E)$, as being inversely proportional to the defect creation rate:\n$$\\mathrm{TTF}(E) \\propto \\frac{1}{R_{cr}(E)}$$\nTherefore, the field dependence of $\\mathrm{TTF}(E)$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{TTF}(E) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{W_0}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha E}{k_B T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{W_0}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha E}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nSince the temperature $T$ is constant, the term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{W_0}{k_B T}\\right)$ is also a constant. We can combine this with the proportionality constant into a single pre-factor, $A_0$. This leads to the exponential field dependence known as the $E$-model:\n$$\\mathrm{TTF}(E) = A_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{k_B T} E\\right)$$\nThis model is conventionally written in the form:\n$$\\mathrm{TTF}(E) = A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E)$$\nBy comparing the derived expression with the conventional form, we identify the field acceleration factor, $\\gamma$, as:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{\\alpha}{k_B T}$$\nThis confirms that $\\gamma$ encapsulates the sensitivity of the failure time to the electric field, which is determined by the material's barrier-lowering parameter $\\alpha$ relative to the available thermal energy $k_B T$.\n\nTo compute the numerical value of $\\gamma$ from the experimental data, we use the model equation for the two given data points:\n$$ \\mathrm{TTF}_1 = A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E_1) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{TTF}_2 = A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E_2) $$\nTo eliminate the unknown pre-factor $A_0$, we take the ratio of these two equations:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{TTF}_1}{\\mathrm{TTF}_2} = \\frac{A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E_1)}{A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E_2)} = \\exp(-\\gamma E_1 - (-\\gamma E_2)) = \\exp(\\gamma(E_2 - E_1)) $$\nTo solve for $\\gamma$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{TTF}_1}{\\mathrm{TTF}_2}\\right) = \\gamma(E_2 - E_1) $$\nIsolating $\\gamma$ yields the final expression for its calculation:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{TTF}_1}{\\mathrm{TTF}_2}\\right)}{E_2 - E_1} $$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression. The units of time for $\\mathrm{TTF}$ will cancel.

Second, we substitute these fields into the given Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) model to find the specified ratio, $R$.\n\nStage 1: Derivation of the electric fields $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$.\n\nThe bilayer dielectric stack can be modeled as two capacitors in series. The problem states that fringing fields can be neglected, which implies a one-dimensional problem where the electric fields are uniform within each layer and perpendicular to the interface.\n\nLet $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ be the voltage drops across layer $1$ and layer $2$, respectively. The total voltage $V$ applied across the stack is the sum of the individual voltage drops:\n$$V = V_{1} + V_{2}$$\nFor a uniform electric field $E_{i}$ across a layer of thickness $t_{i}$, the voltage drop is $V_{i} = E_{i} t_{i}$. Substituting this into the previous equation gives our first governing equation:\n$$V = E_{1} t_{1} + E_{2} t_{2} \\quad (1)$$\n\nTo find a second, independent equation relating $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$, we use the boundary condition specified for the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$.

The engineering context is Electronic Design Automation (EDA) reliability analysis, and the task is to determine which field-acceleration model better explains the data among two canonical hypotheses used in time-dependent dielectric breakdown. The analysis must be formulated purely as a mathematical and statistical modeling challenge, suitable for implementation in a program.\n\nAssume the following modeling base: In accelerated stress testing, it is widely observed that the logarithm of failure time responds approximately linearly to a chosen function of the stress variable when the acceleration mechanism is exponential in that stress variable. Specifically, if a response variable $y$ depends exponentially on a predictor $u$ as $y = \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta u)$ for constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, then the transformed variable $\\ln(y)$ is linearly related to $u$, i.e., $\\ln(y) = \\alpha + \\beta u$.

This is a simple linear regression model with $p_A=2$ parameters $(\\beta_0=a_0, \\beta_1=a_1)$. The design matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{X}_A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  E_1 \\\\ 1  E_2 \\\\ \\vdots  \\vdots \\\\ 1  E_n \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n- **Model B (1/E-model)**: $\\ln(TTF) = b_0 + b_1 \\left(\\frac{1}{E}\\right) + \\varepsilon$. This is also a simple linear regression model with $p_B=2$ parameters $(\\beta_0=b_0, \\beta_1=b_1)$. The design matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{X}_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1/E_1 \\\\ 1  1/E_2 \\\\ \\vdots  \\vdots \\\\ 1  1/E_n \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n- **Model C (Combined model)**: $\\ln(TTF) = c_0 + c_1 E + c_2 \\left(\\frac{1}{E}\\right) + \\varepsilon$. This is a multiple regression model with $p_C=3$ parameters $(c_0, c_1, c_2)$. It serves as the \"unrestricted\" model for hypothesis testing. The design matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{X}_C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  E_1  1/E_1 \\\\ 1  E_2  1/E_2 \\\\ \\vdots  \\vdots  \\vdots \\\\ 1  E_n  1/E_n \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n### 3. Hypothesis Testing via Partial F-test\n\nTo assess whether a predictor adds significant explanatory power to a model that already contains other predictors, we use a partial F-test. This test compares a \"restricted\" model (where some coefficients are forced to be zero) with an \"unrestricted\" model.\n\n- **Testing the significance of $E$ in the presence of $1/E$**: We test the null hypothesis $H_0: c_1 = 0$ in Model C. This makes Model B the restricted model and Model C the unrestricted model. The F-statistic is:\n$$ F_E = \\frac{(RSS_B - RSS_C) / q}{RSS_C / (n - p_C)} $$\nwhere $RSS_B$ and $RSS_C$ are the residual sums of squares for Models B and C, respectively. Here, $q=1$ is the number of restrictions, $n$ is the number of data points, and $p_C=3$ is the number of parameters in the unrestricted model (Model C). The statistic follows an F-distribution with $(q, n - p_C)$ degrees of freedom. We compute a $p$-value, $p_E$, which is the probability of observing an F-statistic as large as or larger than $F_E$ under the null hypothesis.\n\n- **Testing the significance of $1/E$ in the presence of $E$**: We test the null hypothesis $H_0: c_2 = 0$ in Model C. This makes Model A the restricted model. The F-statistic is:\n$$ F_{1/E} = \\frac{(RSS_A - RSS_C) / q}{RSS_C / (n - p_C)} $$\nThis also follows an F-distribution with $(q, n - p_C)$ degrees of freedom. From this, we compute the corresponding $p$-value, $p_{1/E}$.\n\n### 4. Decision Rule for Model Selection\n\nA decision rule with a significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$ is used to select between Model A and Model B.\n\n1.  If $p_E  \\alpha$ and $p_{1/E} \\ge \\alpha$: The $E$ term is significant while the $1/E$ term is not. Choose Model A.\n2.  If $p_{1/E}  \\alpha$ and $p_E \\ge \\alpha$: The $1/E$ term is significant while the $E$ term is not. Choose Model B.\n3.  If $p_E  \\alpha$ and $p_{1/E}  \\alpha$: Both terms are significant. Choose the simpler model (A or B) that provides a better fit, judged by the smaller $RSS$. The tie-breaker is to choose Model A.\n4.  If $p_E \\ge \\alpha$ and $p_{1/E} \\ge \\alpha$: Neither term adds significant value over the other in the combined model. Choose the simpler model with better goodness-of-fit, judged by the larger coefficient of determination ($R^2$). The tie-breaker is to choose Model A.\n\nThis comprehensive procedure allows for a rigorous, data-driven comparison of the two competing TDDB acceleration models. The implementation involves applying these matrix algebra and statistical formulas to each provided dataset.",
