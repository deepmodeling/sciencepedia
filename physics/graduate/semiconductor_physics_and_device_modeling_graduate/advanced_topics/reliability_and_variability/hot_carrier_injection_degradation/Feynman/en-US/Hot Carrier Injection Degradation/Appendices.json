This first practice grounds the concept in fundamental physics by calculating the energy an electron gains as it accelerates through the intense electric field near a transistor's drain. By applying the work-energy theorem to a simplified yet representative model of the device, you will determine the maximum kinetic energy a carrier can acquire, which is the foundational step in the Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) degradation chain .",

            "problem": "An electron in the channel of an N-type Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor (NMOS) transistor is accelerated by the electric field near the drain, producing hot carrier injection (HCI). Consider an NMOS with channel length $L = 20\\ \\text{nm}$ and drain-to-source voltage $V_{ds} = 1.2\\ \\text{V}$. Near the drain-side, the longitudinal electric field exhibits a peak of magnitude $E_{\\text{peak}} = 1.5\\ \\text{MV/cm}$ that can be approximated as spatially constant over a drain-adjacent segment of length $\\ell = 5\\ \\text{nm}$. Assume ballistic transport through this high-field segment (no scattering and no energy relaxation within $\\ell$), and neglect any initial kinetic energy compared to the field-induced energy gain. Starting from first principles—namely, the Lorentz force on a charge in an electric field and the work–energy theorem—derive the expression for the maximum kinetic energy acquired by an electron upon exiting the high-field segment, and compute its value. Enforce physical consistency by ensuring the resulting energy does not exceed the energy corresponding to the applied drain-to-source voltage $q V_{ds}$, where $q$ is the elementary charge. Express the final energy in electron-volts (eV) and round your numerical answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the maximum kinetic energy acquired by an electron in a high-field region of an NMOS transistor, starting from first principles. The specified principles are the Lorentz force and the work–energy theorem.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing physical laws. The force $\\vec{F}$ exerted on a charge carrier by an electric field $\\vec{E}$ is a component of the Lorentz force. In the absence of a magnetic field, this force is given by $\\vec{F} = q_{charge}\\vec{E}$. For an electron, the charge is $q_{charge} = -q$, where $q$ is the elementary charge, a positive constant. Thus, the force on an electron is $\\vec{F} = -q\\vec{E}$.\n\nNext, the work–energy theorem states that the work $W$ done by the net force on a particle is equal to the change in its kinetic energy, $\\Delta K$.\n$$W = \\Delta K = K_{f} - K_{i}$$\nwhere $K_{i}$ is the initial kinetic energy and $K_{f}$ is the final kinetic energy.\n\nThe work done by the electric force on the electron as it moves along a path $\\mathcal{C}$ is given by the line integral:\n$$W = \\int_{\\mathcal{C}} \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{s}$$\nwhere $d\\vec{s}$ is the differential displacement vector along the path.\n\nThe problem simplifies the physical situation. We consider a one-dimensional segment of length $\\ell$ near the drain, where the longitudinal electric field has a constant magnitude $E_{\\text{peak}}$. Let the direction of electron motion be along the $x$-axis, from $x=0$ to $x=\\ell$. In an NMOS, the drain is at a higher potential than the source, so the electric field vector $\\vec{E}$ points from the drain towards the source. If the electron is moving towards the drain, its velocity is in the opposite direction to the electric field vector. Let the electric field be $\\vec{E} = -E_{\\text{peak}}\\hat{x}$. The force on the electron is therefore:\n$$\\vec{F} = -q\\vec{E} = -q(-E_{\\text{peak}}\\hat{x}) = qE_{\\text{peak}}\\hat{x}$$\nThe force is constant and directed along the positive $x$-axis, accelerating the electron.\n\nThe work done on the electron as it traverses this segment from $x=0$ to $x=\\ell$ is:\n$$W = \\int_{0}^{\\ell} \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{x} = \\int_{0}^{\\ell} (qE_{\\text{peak}}\\hat{x}) \\cdot (dx\\,\\hat{x}) = \\int_{0}^{\\ell} qE_{\\text{peak}}\\,dx$$\nSince $q$ and $E_{\\text{peak}}$ are constants over this segment, we can take them out of the integral:\n$$W = qE_{\\text{peak}} \\int_{0}^{\\ell} dx = qE_{\\text{peak}}\\ell$$\nThis work done by the field is converted into kinetic energy. According to the problem statement, we are to assume ballistic transport (no energy loss to scattering) and neglect the initial kinetic energy of the electron, so $K_{i} = 0$.\n\nApplying the work–energy theorem, the maximum kinetic energy $K_{\\text{max}}$ acquired by the electron upon exiting the segment is equal to the work done on it:\n$$K_{\\text{max}} = K_{f} = W + K_{i} = W + 0 = W$$\nTherefore, the expression for the maximum kinetic energy is:\n$$K_{\\text{max}} = qE_{\\text{peak}}\\ell$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value. The given values are:\n-   $E_{\\text{peak}} = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{MV/cm}$\n-   $\\ell = 5\\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n\nWe must always work in a consistent system of units, such as the International System of Units (SI).\nFirst, we convert the electric field to units of V/m:\n$$E_{\\text{peak}} = 1.5\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{MV}}{\\mathrm{cm}} = 1.5 \\times \\frac{10^6\\ \\mathrm{V}}{10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 1.5 \\times 10^8\\ \\mathrm{V/m}$$\nNext, we convert the length of the segment to meters:\n$$\\ell = 5\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNow we can substitute these values into our derived expression for energy:\n$$K_{\\text{max}} = q \\times (1.5 \\times 10^8\\ \\mathrm{V/m}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})$$\n$$K_{\\text{max}} = q \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{V}) = q \\times (0.75\\ \\mathrm{V})$$\nThe energy is expressed in Joules. However, the problem asks for the answer in electron-volts (eV). By definition, one electron-volt is the amount of kinetic energy gained by a single electron when it accelerates through an electric potential difference of one volt. That is, $1\\ \\mathrm{eV} = q \\times (1\\ \\mathrm{V})$.\nTherefore, the kinetic energy in electron-volts is numerically equal to the potential difference in volts through which the electron was accelerated.\nThe effective potential drop over the segment $\\ell$ is $\\Delta V = E_{\\text{peak}}\\ell = 0.75\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\nSo, the kinetic energy is:\n$$K_{\\text{max}} = 0.75\\ \\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nThe problem requires a physical consistency check: the calculated energy must not exceed the total energy available from the source-drain voltage, $qV_{ds}$.\nGiven $V_{ds} = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{V}$, the maximum possible energy gain for an electron traversing the entire channel from source to drain without any energy loss is $qV_{ds} = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\nOur calculated energy is $K_{\\text{max}} = 0.75\\ \\mathrm{eV}$. Since $0.75\\ \\mathrm{eV} \\leq 1.2\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, the result is physically consistent. This signifies that the high-field region, where the majority of the energy is gained, only accounts for a fraction of the total applied voltage drop, which is expected in a real transistor.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the numerical answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$K_{\\text{max}} = 0.750\\ \\mathrm{eV}$$",

Consider an electron attempting to inject from silicon into silicon dioxide in the presence of a spatially uniform normal electric field $E_{ox}$ within the oxide.\n\nStarting from electrostatics and classical image-charge theory at a planar interface, and treating the electron as a classical point charge in a continuous medium of permittivity $\\varepsilon_{ox}$, derive the barrier-lowering in energy units by finding the saddle point of the combined potential energy along the normal direction.

            "solution": "Let the planar silicon-oxide interface be located at the plane $x=0$, with silicon occupying the half-space $x<0$ and silicon dioxide occupying the half-space $x>0$. An electron, with charge $-q$, is located at a position $x$ within the oxide.\n\nThe total potential energy of the electron, $U_{total}(x)$, is the superposition of the potential energy due to the image charge and the potential energy due to the external electric field, measured relative to the conduction band edge at the interface. The position-dependent part of the potential energy, $U(x)$, is what we need to analyze.\n\n1.  **Potential Energy from Image Charge**: To calculate the image force, the silicon is approximated as a perfect conductor. An electron with charge $-q$ at position $x$ in the dielectric oxide induces a positive image charge of $+q$ at position $-x$ inside the silicon. The electrostatic force on the electron due to this image charge is attractive and given by Coulomb's law in a medium of permittivity $\\varepsilon_{ox}$:\n    $$ \\vec{F}_{image}(x) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}} \\frac{(-q)(+q)}{(2x)^2} \\hat{x} = -\\frac{q^2}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}x^2} \\hat{x} $$\n    The potential energy $U_{image}(x)$ is obtained by integrating this force from a reference point, typically infinity, to the position $x$:\n    $$ U_{image}(x) = -\\int_{\\infty}^x \\vec{F}_{image}(x') \\cdot d\\vec{x'} = -\\int_{\\infty}^x \\left( -\\frac{q^2}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}x'^2} \\right) dx' = \\left[ -\\frac{q^2}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}x'} \\right]_{\\infty}^x = -\\frac{q^2}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}x} $$\n\n2.  **Potential Energy from External Field**: The uniform electric field $E_{ox}$ is directed from the gate towards the silicon, so we define $\\vec{E} = -E_{ox} \\hat{x}$, where $E_{ox}$ is the magnitude of the field. The force on the electron from this field is:\n    $$ \\vec{F}_{field} = (-q)\\vec{E} = (-q)(-E_{ox}\\hat{x}) = qE_{ox}\\hat{x} $$\n    The potential energy $U_{field}(x)$ relative to the interface at $x=0$ is:\n    $$ U_{field}(x) = -\\int_{0}^x \\vec{F}_{field} \\cdot d\\vec{x'} = -\\int_{0}^x qE_{ox} dx' = -qE_{ox}x $$\n\n3.  **Total Potential Energy and Saddle Point**: The total position-dependent potential energy of the electron in the oxide is the sum of these two contributions:\n    $$ U(x) = U_{image}(x) + U_{field}(x) = -\\frac{q^2}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}x} - qE_{ox}x $$\n    The field and image charge effectively modify the shape of the total potential barrier $\\Phi(x) = \\Phi_B + U(x)$. The maximum of this potential energy function $U(x)$ corresponds to the saddle point of the potential energy landscape and represents the peak of the barrier that the electron must surmount. To find the position of this maximum, $x_{max}$, we set the derivative of $U(x)$ with respect to $x$ equal to zero:\n    $$ \\frac{dU}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -\\frac{q^2}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}x} - qE_{ox}x \\right) = \\frac{q^2}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}x^2} - qE_{ox} = 0 $$\n    Solving for $x_{max}$:\n    $$ \\frac{q^2}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}x_{max}^2} = qE_{ox} \\implies x_{max}^2 = \\frac{q}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}E_{ox}} \\implies x_{max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{q}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}E_{ox}}} $$\n\n4.  **Barrier Lowering Derivation**: The barrier lowering, $\\Delta \\Phi_B$, is the magnitude of the potential energy at this maximum, $U(x_{max})$.\n    $$ U_{max} = U(x_{max}) = -\\frac{q^2}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}x_{max}} - qE_{ox}x_{max} $$\n    Substituting the expression for $x_{max}$:\n    $$ U_{max} = -\\frac{q^2}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}E_{ox}}{q}} \\right) - qE_{ox} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{q}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}E_{ox}}} \\right) $$\n    $$ U_{max} = -q^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{E_{ox}}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}q}} - qE_{ox} \\sqrt{\\frac{q}{16\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}E_{ox}}} = -\\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{q^3E_{ox}}{\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}}} - \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{q^3E_{ox}}{\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}}} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{q^3E_{ox}}{\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}}} $$\n    The barrier lowering is the positive quantity $\\Delta \\Phi_B = |U_{max}| = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{q^3E_{ox}}{\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}}}$. To express this energy lowering in equivalent voltage units, $\\Delta \\phi$, we divide by the elementary charge $q$:\n    $$ \\Delta \\phi = \\frac{\\Delta \\Phi_B}{q} = \\frac{1}{q} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{q^3E_{ox}}{\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{qE_{ox}}{\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}}} $$\n\n**Qualitative Explanation**: In a thermionic emission model, the probability of an electron crossing a potential barrier of height $\\Phi_B$ is exponentially dependent on the barrier height, typically proportional to $\\exp(-\\Phi_B / (k_B T))$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature. The derived barrier lowering, $\\Delta \\Phi_B$, reduces the effective barrier height to $\\Phi_{B,eff} = \\Phi_B - \\Delta \\Phi_B$. Consequently, the injection probability is enhanced by a factor of $\\exp(\\Delta \\Phi_B / (k_B T))$. Since $\\Delta \\Phi_B \\propto \\sqrt{E_{ox}}$, a stronger gate-bias (which increases the normal field $E_{ox}$) leads to greater barrier lowering. This results in a super-linear, specifically exponential of square root, increase in the hot carrier injection current as a function of the gate-controlled field. This mechanism is a primary driver of HCI degradation.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**:\nFirst, convert the given electric field to SI units:\n$$ E_{ox} = 8\\ \\mathrm{MV/cm} = 8 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{V/cm} \\times \\frac{100\\ \\mathrm{cm}}{1\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 8 \\times 10^8\\ \\mathrm{V/m} $$\nNext, calculate the permittivity of silicon dioxide:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{ox} = \\varepsilon_{r,ox}\\varepsilon_{0} = 3.9 \\times 8.854\\,187\\,8128 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m} \\approx 3.45313 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{F/m} $$\nNow, substitute the values into the derived expression for $\\Delta \\phi$:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{qE_{ox}}{\\pi\\varepsilon_{ox}}} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{(1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}) (8 \\times 10^8\\ \\mathrm{V/m})}{\\pi (3.9 \\times 8.854\\,187\\,8128 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m})}} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1.2817413 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{J/m}}{1.0848316 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}}} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{1.181514\\ \\mathrm{V^2}} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = \\frac{1}{2} (1.0869748\\ \\mathrm{V}) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\phi \\approx 0.5434874\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi \\approx 0.5435\\ \\mathrm{V} $$",
