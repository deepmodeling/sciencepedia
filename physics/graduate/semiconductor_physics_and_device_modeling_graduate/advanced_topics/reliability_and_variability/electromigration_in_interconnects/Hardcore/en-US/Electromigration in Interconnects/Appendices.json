At the cathode ($x=0$), we set $J_a(0,t)=0$:\n$$ J_a(0,t) = -\\frac{D}{\\Omega k_B T} \\left( \\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=0} + Z^* e \\rho J \\right) = 0 $$\nThis gives the Neumann boundary condition at the cathode:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=0} = -\\frac{Z^* e \\rho J}{\\Omega} $$\nThe far end ($x=L$) is a stress reservoir, giving a Dirichlet boundary condition: $\\sigma(L,t)=0$. The initial condition is a stress-free line: $\\sigma(x,0)=0$.\n\n**2. Numerical Implementation**\n\nThe derived PDE with its boundary conditions can be solved using a Finite Difference Method. The Python script below implements an explicit time-marching scheme to find the time required for the tensile stress at the cathode to reach the nucleation threshold $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the electromigration problem for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1\n        (1.0e-4, 5.0e10, 373, 1.0e-18, 2.0e-8, -10, 1.6e11, 1.18e-29, 4.0e8, 1.0e6),\n        # Case 2\n        (1.0e-5, 5.0e10, 373, 1.0e-18, 2.0e-8, -10, 1.6e11, 1.18e-29, 4.0e8, 1.0e6),\n        # Case 3\n        (1.0e-4, 5.0e10, 423, 5.0e-18, 2.2e-8, -10, 1.6e11, 1.18e-29, 3.0e8, 1.0e6),\n        # Case 4\n        (2.0e-4, 1.0e10, 373, 1.0e-18, 2.0e-8, -10, 1.6e11, 1.18e-29, 2.0e8, 1.0e6),\n        # Case 5\n        (1.0e-4, 5.0e10, 373, 1.0e-18, 2.0e-8, -10, 1.6e11, 1.18e-29, 1.0e9, 1.0e6),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for params in test_cases:\n        nucleation_time = simulate_stress_evolution(*params)\n        results.append(nucleation_time)\n\n    def format_float(f):\n        \"\"\"Formats a float to 6 significant figures as requested.\"\"\"\n        if f == -1.0:\n            return \"-1.0\"\n        return f\"{f:.6g}\"\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(format_float, results))}]\")\n\ndef simulate_stress_evolution(L, J, T, D, rho, Z_star, B, Omega, sigma_th, t_max):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the 1D stress evolution PDE and finds the nucleation time.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Fundamental Constants\n    k_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\n    e = 1.602176634e-19   # Elementary charge (C)\n\n    # Numerical Parameters\n    Nx = 200  # Number of spatial divisions\n    dx = L / Nx\n\n    # Derived Physical Coefficients\n    D_sigma = (B * Omega * D) / (k_B * T)\n    # The BC is ∂σ/∂x = -G₀ where G₀ = Z*eρJ/Ω\n    G0 = (Z_star * e * rho * J) / Omega\n\n    # Time step from stability condition α = D_sigma * dt / dx^2 = 0.5\n    alpha = 0.45\n    dt = alpha * dx**2 / D_sigma\n\n    # Initialization\n    sigma = np.zeros(Nx + 1)\n    t = 0.0\n\n    # Main time-marching loop\n    while t  t_max:\n        sigma_cathode_prev = sigma[0]\n        \n        sigma_new = np.zeros_like(sigma)\n        # Vectorized update for interior nodes (i=1 to Nx-1)\n        sigma_new[1:Nx] = sigma[1:Nx] + alpha * (sigma[2:Nx+1] - 2 * sigma[1:Nx] + sigma[0:Nx-1])\n\n        # Update for cathode (i=0) using ghost node for Neumann BC: ∂σ/∂x = -G0\n        # This leads to σ_new[0] = σ[0] + α*(2σ[1] - 2σ[0] + 2*dx*(-G0))\n        sigma_new[0] = sigma[0] + alpha * (2 * sigma[1] - 2 * sigma[0] - 2 * dx * G0)\n\n        # Dirichlet BC at x=L (i=Nx) is handled by sigma_new[Nx] remaining 0.\n        \n        # Check for threshold crossing\n        if sigma_new[0] >= sigma_th:\n            if sigma_new[0] > sigma_cathode_prev and sigma_cathode_prev  sigma_th:\n                fraction = (sigma_th - sigma_cathode_prev) / (sigma_new[0] - sigma_cathode_prev)\n                t_cross = t + fraction * dt\n                return min(t_cross, t_max)\n            else:\n                return t\n\n        sigma = sigma_new\n        t += dt\n\n    # Check Blech condition: if steady-state stress is below threshold\n    sigma_ss_max = -G0 * L\n    if sigma_ss_max  sigma_th:\n        return -1.0\n    \n    return -1.0\n\n# This block allows the code to be executed to generate the answer.\n# if __name__ == '__main__':\n#     solve()\n```",
