            "solution": "The task is to derive an expression for the magnitude of the electromigration driving force, $F_{EM}$, on a single copper atom and then evaluate it numerically. The derivation begins from two fundamental principles as instructed: the electrostatic force on a charge and Ohm's law.\n\nThe electromigration force is modeled as the force exerted by the local electric field, $E$, on an ion with an effective charge, $q_{eff}$. The effective charge accounts for both the direct electrostatic force on the ion core and the momentum transfer from the electron wind. This force is given by the standard electrostatic formula:\n$$\nF_{EM} = q_{eff} E\n$$\nThe effective charge, $q_{eff}$, is defined in terms of the effective charge number, $Z^*$, and the elementary charge, $e$, as:\n$$\nq_{eff} = Z^* e\n$$\nSubstituting this into the force equation yields:\n$$\nF_{EM} = Z^* e E\n$$\nThe next step is to relate the electric field, $E$, to the macroscopic current density, $J$, and the material's resistivity, $\\rho$.

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins by establishing a force balance on a single migrating atom within the interconnect. Two primary forces act on the atom in this one-dimensional model.\n\n1.  **The Electron Wind Force ($F_{wind}$)**: This is the driving force for electromigration. It results from the momentum transfer from the current-carrying electrons to the metal ions. The force is directed along the electron flow and is given by:\n    $$F_{wind} = |Z^*| e E$$\n    where $|Z^*|$ is the magnitude of the effective charge number, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $E$ is the magnitude of the electric field driving the current.\n\n2.  **The Back-Stress Force ($F_{stress}$)**: Due to the blocking boundaries, there is a net accumulation of atoms at the anode and a depletion at the cathode. This creates a gradient in hydrostatic stress, $\\sigma$. This stress gradient exerts a mechanical force on the atoms, opposing the electron wind force. The force on a single atom due to the stress gradient is:\n    $$F_{stress} = -\\Omega \\frac{d\\sigma}{dx}$$\n    where $\\Omega$ is the atomic volume and $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx}$ is the stress gradient along the length of the interconnect (coordinate $x$). The negative sign indicates that the force is directed from regions of higher stress to regions of lower stress.\n\nIn steady state, the net atomic flux must be zero everywhere along the interconnect. This condition is met when the driving force from the electron wind is exactly balanced by the counteracting force from the back-stress gradient. Therefore, the net force on an atom is zero:\n$$F_{net} = F_{wind} + F_{stress} = 0$$\n$$|Z^*| e E - \\Omega \\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} = 0$$\n\nAccording to Ohm's law for a conductor with uniform resistivity $\\rho$ and uniform current density $j$, the electric field $E$ is constant and given by:\n$$E = \\rho j$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $E$ into the force balance equation yields:\n$$|Z^*| e (\\rho j) - \\Omega \\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} = 0$$\n\nRearranging this equation gives an expression for the steady-state stress gradient:\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} = \\frac{|Z^*| e \\rho j}{\\Omega}$$\nSince all terms on the right-hand side are constants, the stress gradient $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx}$ is uniform along the length of the interconnect. This implies that the hydrostatic stress $\\sigma$ is a linear function of the position $x$.\n\nTo find the total stress difference, $\\Delta\\sigma$, between the ends of the line (from $x=0$ to $x=L$), we integrate the stress gradient along the length $L$:\n$$\\Delta\\sigma = \\sigma(L) - \\sigma(0) = \\int_0^L \\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} dx$$\n$$\\Delta\\sigma = \\int_0^L \\left(\\frac{|Z^*| e \\rho j}{\\Omega}\\right) dx = \\frac{|Z^*| e \\rho j}{\\Omega} \\int_0^L dx$$\n$$\\Delta\\sigma = \\frac{|Z^*| e \\rho j L}{\\Omega}$$\n\nThe problem states that damage initiates when this stress difference reaches a critical value, $\\sigma_{crit}$. The maximum current density, $j_{max}$, is the current density that produces this critical stress difference. By setting $\\Delta\\sigma = \\sigma_{crit}$ and $j = j_{max}$, we obtain:\n$$\\sigma_{crit} = \\frac{|Z^*| e \\rho j_{max} L}{\\Omega}$$\n\nSolving for $j_{max}$ gives the desired analytical expression:\n$$j_{max} = \\frac{\\sigma_{crit} \\Omega}{|Z^*| e \\rho L}$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression to calculate $j_{max}$.\n- $L = 1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\rho = 1.70 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$\n- $|Z^*| = 100$\n- $\\Omega = 1.18 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3$\n- $\\sigma_{crit} = 4.00 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\n$$j_{max} = \\frac{(4.00 \\times 10^{8}) \\times (1.18 \\times 10^{-29})}{(100) \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times (1.70 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{-6})}$$\n$$j_{max} = \\frac{4.72 \\times 10^{-21}}{1.602 \\times 1.70 \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{-19 - 8 - 6 + 2}}$$\n$$j_{max} = \\frac{4.72 \\times 10^{-21}}{2.7234 \\times 10^{-31}}$$\n$$j_{max} \\approx 1.73313 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{A}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is:\n$$j_{max} = 1.733 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{A}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\n\n### Interpretation of Scaling\n\nThe derived expression for the maximum allowable current density is $j_{max} = \\frac{\\sigma_{crit} \\Omega}{|Z^*| e \\rho L}$. This result shows that $j_{max}$ is inversely proportional to the interconnect length $L$:\n$$j_{max} \\propto \\frac{1}{L}$$\nThis relationship can be rearranged into the well-known \"Blech product\" criterion:\n$$j_{max} \\cdot L = \\frac{\\sigma_{crit} \\Omega}{|Z^*| e \\rho} = \\text{constant}$$\nFor interconnect design, this scaling has a critical implication: there is a fundamental trade-off between the length of an interconnect segment and the maximum current density it can reliably carry.\n- Short interconnects (small $L$) can sustain a much higher current density ($j_{max}$) before the stress buildup reaches the critical failure point.\n- Long interconnects (large $L$) are more susceptible to electromigration-induced stress failure and must be operated at a lower current density.\nThis inverse relationship informs design rules for integrated circuits. To mitigate electromigration risk, designers must either limit the current density in long global interconnects or break long lines into shorter segments separated by vias or contacts to wider metal layers, which act as reservoirs for atoms and effectively reset the length $L$ over which stress can accumulate. For any given operating current density $j$, there exists a critical length, the \"Blech length\" $L_c = (j \\cdot L)_{crit} / j$, below which the interconnect is considered immune to this specific failure mode.",

            "solution": "### Step 1: Derivation of the Governing PDE\n\nThe derivation starts from three fundamental principles: atomic mass conservation, a constitutive relation for atomic flux, and a linear elastic stress-concentration coupling.\n\n1.  **Atomic Mass Conservation**: The conservation of atoms in one dimension is expressed by the continuity equation:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J_a}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n    where $c(x,t)$ is the atomic concentration and $J_a(x,t)$ is the atomic flux.\n\n2.  **Constitutive Law for Atomic Flux ($J_a$)**: The atomic flux is driven by gradients in the chemical potential, $\\mu$, and is proportional to the driving force via the Nernst-Einstein relation. Adopting a convention where compressive stress is positive, the chemical potential for an atom under an electric potential $\\phi$ and hydrostatic stress $\\sigma$ is $\\mu = \\mu_0 - Z^*e\\phi + \\sigma\\Omega$. The flux $J_a$ (positive in the $+x$ direction) is:\n    $$ J_a = -\\frac{Dc}{k_B T} \\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial x} $$\n    Assuming concentration $c$ is close to its equilibrium value $c_0 = 1/\\Omega$, we have:\n    $$ J_a = -\\frac{D(1/\\Omega)}{k_B T} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\mu_0 - Z^*e\\phi + \\sigma\\Omega) = -\\frac{D}{\\Omega k_B T} \\left(-Z^*e \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} + \\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}\\right) $$\n    Using Ohm's law, the electric field $E = -\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = \\rho J$, where we assume current $J$ flows from anode to cathode (in the $+x$ direction, so electrons flow in $-x$). The electron wind pushes atoms towards the anode ($x=0$), so the atomic flux is generally negative. If we define $J_a$ as positive in the direction of electron flow (towards anode), the electron wind term is positive. A more standard convention, consistent with the Korhonen model, is to define the stress and flux such that a positive electromigration term drives flux:\n    $$ J_a = \\frac{D c_0}{k_B T} \\left(Z^*e E - \\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{D}{\\Omega k_B T} \\left(Z^*e \\rho J - \\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Linear Elastic Coupling**: The change in atomic concentration from equilibrium, $\\delta c = c - c_0$, is related to the hydrostatic stress $\\sigma$ by the biaxial modulus $B$ for a confined line:\n    $$ \\sigma = -B \\Omega (c - c_0) $$\n    where tensile stress is positive. Differentiating with respect to time: $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial t} = -B \\Omega \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}$.\n\n4.  **Final PDE**: We combine these relations. From conservation, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J_a}{\\partial x}$, so $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial t} = B \\Omega \\frac{\\partial J_a}{\\partial x}$.\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial t} = B \\Omega \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ \\frac{D}{\\Omega k_B T} \\left(Z^*e \\rho J - \\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}\\right) \\right] $$\n    Assuming all parameters except $\\sigma$ are spatially uniform, the equation simplifies to the well-known Korhonen equation for stress evolution:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ \\mathcal{D}_{\\sigma} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} - \\frac{Z^*e \\rho J}{\\Omega}\\right) \\right] $$\n    where $\\mathcal{D}_{\\sigma} = \\frac{B\\Omega D}{k_B T}$ is the effective stress diffusivity. This is a advection-diffusion type equation for stress.\n\n### Step 2: Boundary and Initial Conditions\n\nThe problem describes a domain $x \\in [0, L]$ with $x=0$ at the anode.\n-   **Anode End ($x=0$)**: The \"blocking\" condition means zero net atomic flux: $J_a(0,t) = 0$.\n    $$ J_a(0,t) = \\frac{D}{\\Omega k_B T} \\left(Z^*e \\rho J - \\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=0}\\right) = 0 $$\n    This implies a Neumann boundary condition:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=0} = \\frac{Z^*e\\rho J}{\\Omega} $$\n    Let's define $G_0 = \\frac{Z^*e\\rho J}{\\Omega}$.

An explicit FTCS scheme is implemented as follows.\nThe equation is discretized on a grid $x_i = i \\Delta x$ and time $t_n = n \\Delta t$.\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_i^{n+1} - \\sigma_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\mathcal{D}_{\\sigma} \\frac{\\sigma_{i+1}^n - 2\\sigma_i^n + \\sigma_{i-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2} $$\nThe stability requires $\\alpha = \\frac{\\mathcal{D}_{\\sigma} \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le 0.5$. The boundary condition at the anode is handled with a ghost node $\\sigma_{-1}^n$ such that $\\frac{\\sigma_1^n - \\sigma_{-1}^n}{2\\Delta x} = G_0$, leading to the update rule at $i=0$:\n$$ \\sigma_0^{n+1} = \\sigma_0^n + \\alpha (2\\sigma_1^n - 2\\sigma_0^n - 2\\Delta x G_0) $$\nThe following Python code implements this scheme.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the electromigration problem for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1\n        (1.0e-4, 5.0e10, 373, 1.0e-18, 2.0e-8, 10, 1.6e11, 1.18e-29, 4.0e8, 1.0e6),\n        # Case 2\n        (1.0e-5, 5.0e10, 373, 1.0e-18, 2.0e-8, 10, 1.6e11, 1.18e-29, 4.0e8, 1.0e6),\n        # Case 3\n        (1.0e-4, 5.0e10, 423, 5.0e-18, 2.2e-8, 10, 1.6e11, 1.18e-29, 3.0e8, 1.0e6),\n        # Case 4\n        (2.0e-4, 1.0e10, 373, 1.0e-18, 2.0e-8, 10, 1.6e11, 1.18e-29, 2.0e8, 1.0e6),\n        # Case 5\n        (1.0e-4, 5.0e10, 373, 1.0e-18, 2.0e-8, 10, 1.6e11, 1.18e-29, 1.0e9, 1.0e6),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for params in test_cases:\n        nucleation_time = simulate_stress_evolution(*params)\n        results.append(nucleation_time)\n\ndef simulate_stress_evolution(L, J, T, D, rho, Z_star, B, Omega, sigma_th, t_max):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the 1D stress evolution PDE and finds the nucleation time.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Fundamental Constants\n    k_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\n    e = 1.602176634e-19   # Elementary charge (C)\n\n    # Numerical Parameters\n    Nx = 200  # Number of spatial divisions\n    dx = L / Nx\n\n    # Derived Physical Coefficients\n    # Effective stress diffusivity\n    D_sigma = (B * Omega * D) / (k_B * T)\n    # Stress gradient magnitude at the anode boundary\n    G0 = (Z_star * e * rho * J) / Omega\n\n    # Time step from Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability condition\n    # alpha = D_sigma * dt / dx^2 <= 0.5.
