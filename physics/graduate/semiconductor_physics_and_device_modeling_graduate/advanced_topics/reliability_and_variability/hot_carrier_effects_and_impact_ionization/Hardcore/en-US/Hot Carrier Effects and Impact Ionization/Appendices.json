            "problem": "A uniformly doped, nondegenerate $n$-type semiconductor is biased by a spatially uniform, static electric field $E$ at lattice temperature $T_{L}$. Assume a single parabolic conduction band, isotropic effective mass, and that the electron ensemble can be described by an effective electron temperature $T_{e}$ defined by equating the average carrier energy per electron to that of a three-dimensional classical gas.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the effective electron temperature, $T_e$, in a semiconductor under a high electric field. The derivation will be based on the principle of power balance in steady state: the rate at which an electron gains energy from the electric field must equal the rate at which it loses energy to the crystal lattice.\n\nFirst, we determine the rate of energy gain per electron from the electric field, $E$. The power supplied by the field per unit volume is given by the Joule heating formula, $P_{in} = \\vec{J} \\cdot \\vec{E}$. Given that the charge transport is described by the drift current density $J = q n \\mu E$, and assuming the field and current are parallel in an isotropic medium, the power density is $P_{in} = J E = (q n \\mu E) E = q n \\mu E^2$. This is the total power delivered to all $n$ electrons per unit volume. To find the power gain per electron, we divide by the electron concentration $n$:\n$$P_{gain, e} = \\frac{P_{in}}{n} = \\frac{q n \\mu E^2}{n} = q \\mu E^2$$\n\nNext, we model the rate of energy loss from the \"hot\" electrons to the \"cold\" lattice. The problem states that the average energy of an electron in the ensemble is given by the expression for a three-dimensional classical gas with an effective temperature $T_e$, which is $\\langle \\mathcal{E} \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T_e$. In thermal equilibrium with the lattice at temperature $T_L$, the average energy would be $\\langle \\mathcal{E}_0 \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T_L$. The excess average energy per electron is therefore:\n$$\\Delta \\mathcal{E} = \\langle \\mathcal{E} \\rangle - \\langle \\mathcal{E}_0 \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} k_B (T_e - T_L)$$\nThe problem specifies that the energy exchange is modeled using a single energy relaxation time, $\\tau_E$. Within this approximation, the rate of energy loss per electron is the excess energy divided by the relaxation time:\n$$P_{loss, e} = \\frac{\\Delta \\mathcal{E}}{\\tau_E} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2} k_B (T_e - T_L)}{\\tau_E}$$\n\nIn steady state, the rate of energy gain must equal the rate of energy loss: $P_{gain, e} = P_{loss, e}$.\n$$q \\mu E^2 = \\frac{3 k_B (T_e - T_L)}{2 \\tau_E}$$\nWe now solve this equation for the effective electron temperature $T_e$:\n$$T_e - T_L = \\frac{2 q \\mu \\tau_E E^2}{3 k_B}$$\n$$T_e = T_L + \\frac{2 q \\mu \\tau_E}{3 k_B} E^2$$\nThis is the explicit expression for $T_e$ in terms of the given parameters.\n\nThe question asks whether $T_e$ depends on the carrier concentration $n$. Observing the derived expression, $T_e$ is a function of $T_L$, $q$, $\\mu$, $\\tau_E$, $E$, and $k_B$. The carrier concentration $n$ does not appear in the final expression. Therefore, within this model, the effective electron temperature $T_e$ does not depend on $n$. This is because both the power input per electron and the energy loss mechanism per electron are independent of the total number of electrons.\n\nNext, we identify the parameter regime where the electron temperature is approximately equal to the lattice temperature, $T_e \\approx T_L$. This condition holds when the second term in the expression for $T_e$ is much smaller than $T_L$:\n$$\\frac{2 q \\mu \\tau_E}{3 k_B} E^2 \\ll T_L$$\nThis can be rewritten as an inequality for the electric field strength $E$:\n$$E^2 \\ll \\frac{3 k_B T_L}{2 q \\mu \\tau_E}$$\nTaking the square root, we find the condition for the low-field regime:\n$$|E| \\ll \\sqrt{\\frac{3 k_B T_L}{2 q \\mu \\tau_E}}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate $T_e$ using the provided numerical data:\n$T_{L} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$E = 2.5 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{V/m}$\n$\\mu = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/(V \\cdot s)}$\n$\\tau_{E} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n$k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$\n\nWe calculate the increase in temperature, $\\Delta T = T_e - T_L$:\n$$\\Delta T = \\frac{2 q \\mu \\tau_E E^2}{3 k_B}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\\Delta T = \\frac{2 (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}) (0.80) (1.20 \\times 10^{-13}) (2.5 \\times 10^{5})^2}{3 (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23})}$$\n$$\\Delta T = \\frac{2 \\times 1.602176634 \\times 0.80 \\times 1.20 \\times 6.25 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 10^{-13} \\times 10^{10}}{3 \\times 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}}\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n$$\\Delta T = \\frac{1.9226119608 \\times 10^{-21}}{4.141947 \\times 10^{-23}}\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n$$\\Delta T \\approx 46.418306\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nThe effective electron temperature is:\n$$T_e = T_L + \\Delta T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K} + 46.418306\\,\\mathrm{K} = 346.418306\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures, we get:\n$$T_e \\approx 346.4\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nThe given value for carrier concentration, $n = 5.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, is not required for this calculation, as demonstrated by the derived formula.",

It describes a standard model of hot-carrier injection in semiconductor devices, based on fundamental principles of electrostatics and statistical mechanics.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a four-part solution involving the analysis of electron injection from silicon ($\\mathrm{Si}$) into silicon dioxide ($\\mathrm{SiO_2}$) over an energy barrier modified by an electric field and image charges.\n\n**1. Derivation of Image-Force Barrier Lowering ($\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{IF}}$)**\n\nAn electron at a distance $x$ into the oxide from the $\\mathrm{Si}$–$\\mathrm{SiO_2}$ interface (at $x=0$) experiences a potential energy, $U(x)$, which is a superposition of three components: the static conduction band offset, the potential due to the uniform electric field, and the potential due to the image charge. We set the reference potential energy to be the conduction band edge of silicon, $E_{c, \\mathrm{Si}} = 0$.\n\nThe static barrier height is given as $\\Phi_b = 3.1 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$. This is the energy required to move an electron from the $\\mathrm{Si}$ conduction band to the $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$ conduction band in the absence of any fields.\n\nThe uniform electric field of magnitude $E$ is applied normal to the interface, pulling electrons into the oxide. We align the $x$-axis normal to the interface, pointing into the $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$. The field is directed towards the $\\mathrm{Si}$, so $\\vec{E} = -E\\hat{x}$. The force on an electron (charge $-e$) is $\\vec{F}_E = (-e)\\vec{E} = eE\\hat{x}$. The potential energy change from the field is $U_E(x) = -\\int_0^x F_{E,x} dx' = -\\int_0^x eE dx' = -eEx$.\n\nThe electron at position $x$ in the dielectric ($\\mathrm{SiO_2}$) induces an image charge in the silicon. Approximating the silicon as a perfect conductor, the image charge is $+e$ located at position $-x$. The force on the electron due to this image charge, according to Coulomb's law in a dielectric medium with permittivity $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, is\n$$F_{\\mathrm{image}}(x) = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}} \\frac{e^2}{(2x)^2} = -\\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}x^2}$$\nThe negative sign indicates an attractive force, pulling the electron back towards the interface. The potential energy associated with this image force, with the reference $U_{\\mathrm{image}}(\\infty)=0$, is\n$$U_{\\mathrm{image}}(x) = -\\int_{\\infty}^x F_{\\mathrm{image}}(x') dx' = -\\int_{\\infty}^x \\left(-\\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}(x')^2}\\right) dx' = -\\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}x}$$\nThe total potential energy of the electron in the oxide, relative to the $\\mathrm{Si}$ conduction band, is the sum of these contributions:\n$$U(x) = \\Phi_b - eEx - \\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}x}$$\nwhere $\\Phi_b$ is the barrier energy. The barrier is lowered by the combined effect of the field and the image force. To find the maximum height of the modified barrier, we find the position $x_{\\mathrm{max}}$ where the total force is zero, which corresponds to the extremum of the potential energy.\n$$\\frac{dU}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\Phi_b - eEx - \\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}x}\\right) = -eE + \\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}x^2}$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find $x_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$-eE + \\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}x_{\\mathrm{max}}^2} = 0 \\implies x_{\\mathrm{max}}^2 = \\frac{e}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}E} \\implies x_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{e}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}E}}$$\nThe maximum potential energy, which is the new effective barrier height $U_{\\mathrm{max}}$, is found by substituting $x_{\\mathrm{max}}$ back into $U(x)$:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\Phi_b - eEx_{\\mathrm{max}} - \\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}x_{\\mathrm{max}}}$$\nFrom the condition for $x_{\\mathrm{max}}$, we have $eE = \\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}x_{\\mathrm{max}}^2}$, which implies $eEx_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}x_{\\mathrm{max}}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $U_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\Phi_b - 2\\left(\\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}x_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\right) = \\Phi_b - \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}x_{\\mathrm{max}}}$$\nThe barrier energy lowering, $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{IF}}$, is the difference between the original barrier $\\Phi_b$ and the new maximum $U_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{IF}} = \\Phi_b - U_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}x_{\\mathrm{max}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $x_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{IF}} = \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}E}{e}}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{e^4}{64\\pi^2\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{16\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}E}{e}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{e^3 E}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}}}$$\nThe problem asks for the barrier lowering potential $\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{IF}}$, where $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{IF}} = e\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{IF}}$.\n$$\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{IF}} = \\frac{\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{IF}}}{e} = \\frac{1}{e}\\sqrt{\\frac{e^3 E}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{eE}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}}}$$\nThis is the expression for the image-force barrier lowering as a function of $E$ and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}$.\n\n**2.

In units of electronvolts, this is numerically equal to the potential in volts.\n$$\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{IF}} \\approx 0.43 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$$\nUsing higher precision for subsequent calculations, $\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{IF}} = 0.429658 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, so the energy lowering is $0.429658 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n**3. Derivation of Injection Probability $P$**\n\nWe model the electrons in the silicon inversion layer as an electron gas with a Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) distribution at an effective temperature $T_e$. For an electron to be injected into the oxide, its kinetic energy component normal to the interface, $\\frac{1}{2}m^*v_x^2$, must be sufficient to overcome the effective barrier height, $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n$$\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\Phi_b - \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{IF}} = \\Phi_b - e\\Delta\\phi_{\\mathrm{IF}}$$\nThe probability $P$ of injection is the ratio of the flux of electrons with sufficient energy to surmount the barrier, $J_{\\mathrm{inj}}$, to the total flux of electrons moving toward the barrier, $J_{\\mathrm{inc}}$. The electron flux is obtained by integrating the velocity-weighted MB distribution.\nThe number of electrons per unit volume with velocity in $d^3v = dv_x dv_y dv_z$ is $dn = n f(\\vec{v}) d^3v$, where $f(\\vec{v})$ is the MB distribution. The flux of electrons moving toward the interface (with $v_x > 0$) is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{inc}} = \\int_0^\\infty v_x \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty n f(\\vec{v}) dv_y dv_z \\right) dv_x $$\nThe flux of injected electrons is limited to those with $v_x \\ge v_{\\mathrm{min}}$, where $\\frac{1}{2}m^*v_{\\mathrm{min}}^2 = \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{inj}} = \\int_{v_{\\mathrm{min}}}^\\infty v_x \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty n f(\\vec{v}) dv_y dv_z \\right) dv_x $$\nThe probability $P$ is the ratio $J_{\\mathrm{inj}} / J_{\\mathrm{inc}}$. The integrals over $v_y$ and $v_z$ are identical for both fluxes and cancel out. The problem reduces to a ratio of 1D integrals:\n$$P = \\frac{\\int_{v_{\\mathrm{min}}}^{\\infty} v_x \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^*v_x^2}{2k_B T_e}\\right) dv_x}{\\int_0^{\\infty} v_x \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^*v_x^2}{2k_B T_e}\\right) dv_x}$$\nLet $u = \\frac{m^*v_x^2}{2k_B T_e}$, so $du = \\frac{m^*v_x}{k_B T_e} dv_x$. The integral becomes $\\int\\frac{k_B T_e}{m^*}e^{-u}du$.\nThe lower limit for the numerator integral is $u_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{m^*v_{\\mathrm{min}}^2}{2k_B T_e} = \\frac{\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{k_B T_e}$. The lower limit for the denominator integral is $u=0$.\n$$P = \\frac{\\int_{\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/k_B T_e}^{\\infty} e^{-u} du}{\\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-u} du} = \\frac{[-e^{-u}]_{\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/k_B T_e}^{\\infty}}{[-e^{-u}]_0^{\\infty}} = \\frac{0 - (-\\exp(-\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/k_B T_e))}{0 - (-1)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{k_B T_e}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{IF}}$:\n$$P = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Phi_b - \\sqrt{\\frac{e^3 E}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}}}}{k_B T_e}\\right)$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the injection probability $P$.\n\n**4. Numerical Estimate of $P$**\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of $P$.

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. All models and assumptions, such as the electric field profile, the Chynoweth law for impact ionization, and the local field approximation, are standard in the field of semiconductor device physics. The tasks are clearly defined and lead to a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: first, a derivation of the electron multiplication factor from fundamental principles; second, a description of the numerical evaluation of the exact and approximate multiplication factors; and third, the calculation of the relative error between these two models.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Electron Multiplication Factor $M$**\n\nWe are asked to derive the governing equation for the expected number of electrons, $m(x)$, as a function of position $x$. We begin with the principle stated in the problem: the incremental mean increase in carriers, $\\mathrm{d}m$, over an infinitesimal distance $\\mathrm{d}x$ is proportional to the current number of carriers, $m(x)$, and the probability of ionization per unit length, $\\alpha_n(E(x))$.\n\nThis physical principle can be formulated as a differential equation. The number of new electron-hole pairs generated in the interval $[x, x+\\mathrm{d}x]$ is equal to the number of electrons at $x$, which is $m(x)$, multiplied by the probability that one of these electrons undergoes an ionizing collision within $\\mathrm{d}x$. This probability is $\\alpha_n(E(x))\\,\\mathrm{d}x$. Thus, the increase in the number of electrons is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}m = m(x) \\alpha_n(E(x))\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}m(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\alpha_n(E(x)) m(x)\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can separate the variables $m$ and $x$ to get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}m}{m} = \\alpha_n(E(x))\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nTo find the total number of electrons at the end of the multiplication region, $x=W$, we integrate both sides. The integration for $m$ is from the initial number of carriers at $x=0$ to the final number at $x=W$. The integration for $x$ is over the length of the region, from $x=0$ to $x=W$. The problem states that a single electron is injected at $x=0$, so the initial condition is $m(0)=1$. The final number of carriers is the multiplication factor itself, $M \\equiv m(W)$.\n$$\n\\int_{m(0)}^{m(W)} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}m}{m} = \\int_{0}^{W} \\alpha_n(E(x))\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nEvaluating the left-hand side integral:\n$$\n[\\ln|m|]_{1}^{M} = \\ln(M) - \\ln(1) = \\ln(M)\n$$\nEquating this with the right-hand side gives:\n$$\n\\ln(M) = \\int_{0}^{W} \\alpha_n(E(x))\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the expression for the electron multiplication factor $M$:\n$$\nM = \\exp\\left(\\int_{0}^{W} \\alpha_n(E(x))\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right)\n$$\nThis derived expression matches the formula provided for $M_{\\mathrm{exact}}$ in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of $M_{\\mathrm{exact}}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{uni}}$**\n\nThe calculation for each parameter set $(E_0, L, W)$ involves three steps: computing $M_{\\mathrm{exact}}$, computing $M_{\\mathrm{uni}}$, and then computing the relative error $\\delta$.\n\n**2.1. Exact Multiplication Factor, $M_{\\mathrm{exact}}$**\n\nTo calculate $M_{\\mathrm{exact}}$, we must numerically evaluate the integral derived above. The integrand is a composite function involving the local electric field $E(x)$ and the ionization coefficient $\\alpha_n(E)$.\n\nThe electric field profile is given by:\n$$\nE(x) = \\frac{E_0}{1 + \\frac{x}{L}}\n$$\nThe electron ionization coefficient is given by the Chynoweth law:\n$$\n\\alpha_n(E) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B}{E}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $E(x)$ into $\\alpha_n(E)$, the integrand becomes:\n$$\n\\alpha_n(E(x)) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B}{E_0/(1 + x/L)}\\right) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B}{E_0}\\left(1 + \\frac{x}{L}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSo, the exact multiplication factor is:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\exp\\left(\\int_{0}^{W} A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B}{E_0}\\left(1 + \\frac{x}{L}\\right)\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right)\n$$\nThis integral will be computed numerically for each case using methods such as the trapezoidal rule or, more accurately, adaptive quadrature, as available in scientific computing libraries.\n\n**2.2. Uniform-Field Approximation, $M_{\\mathrm{uni}}$**\n\nThe uniform-field approximation replaces the position-dependent field $E(x)$ with its spatial average, $E_{\\mathrm{avg}}$, over the interval $[0, W]$. First, we must find the analytical expression for $E_{\\mathrm{avg}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{1}{W}\\int_0^W E(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{W}\\int_0^W \\frac{E_0}{1 + \\frac{x}{L}}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we perform a substitution. Let $u = 1 + x/L$, so $\\mathrm{d}u = (1/L)\\,\\mathrm{d}x$. The limits of integration change from $x=0$ to $u=1$ and from $x=W$ to $u=1+W/L$.\n$$\n\\int_0^W \\frac{E_0}{1 + \\frac{x}{L}}\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_1^{1+W/L} \\frac{E_0}{u} L\\,\\mathrm{d}u = E_0 L \\int_1^{1+W/L} \\frac{1}{u}\\,\\mathrm{d}u = E_0 L [\\ln|u|]_1^{1+W/L}\n$$\n$$\n= E_0 L \\left(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{W}{L}\\right) - \\ln(1)\\right) = E_0 L \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{W}{L}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $E_{\\mathrm{avg}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{E_0 L}{W} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{W}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThe multiplication factor under this approximation, $M_{\\mathrm{uni}}$, assumes a constant ionization coefficient $\\alpha_n(E_{\\mathrm{avg}})$ over the entire length $W$. The integral in the exponent simplifies to $\\alpha_n(E_{\\mathrm{avg}}) \\times W$.\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{uni}} = \\exp\\left(\\alpha_n(E_{\\mathrm{avg}}) \\cdot W\\right) = \\exp\\left(A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B}{E_{\\mathrm{avg}}}\\right) \\cdot W\\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Relative Error, $\\delta$**\n\nThe relative error $\\delta$ quantifies the discrepancy introduced by the uniform-field approximation. It is defined as:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{uni}} - M_{\\mathrm{exact}}}{M_{\\mathrm{exact}}}\n$$\nA negative value of $\\delta$ indicates that the uniform-field approximation underestimates the multiplication factor, which is expected because $\\alpha_n(E)$ is a convex function of $E$.\n\nThe numerical implementation will use the specified material parameters for silicon: $A = 7 \\times 10^7 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ and $B = 1.23 \\times 10^8 \\, \\mathrm{V/m}$. The calculations will be performed for the $4$ given test cases.",
