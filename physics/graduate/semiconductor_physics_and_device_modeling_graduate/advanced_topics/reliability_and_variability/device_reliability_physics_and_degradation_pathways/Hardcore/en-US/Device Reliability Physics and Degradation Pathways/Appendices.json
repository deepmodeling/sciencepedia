This practice explores Random Telegraph Noise (RTN), the discrete switching of a device's current, which serves as a direct electrical fingerprint of a single charge trap near the channel. By working through this problem, you will derive the fundamental relationship between the trap-induced threshold voltage shift ($\\Delta V_{th}$) and the resulting current fluctuation ($\\Delta I$), linking them via the device's transconductance ($g_m$). This exercise is crucial for understanding how microscopic defect dynamics translate into macroscopic performance variability and noise in advanced semiconductor devices.",

The trap occupancy toggling produces an equivalent small positive threshold voltage shift $\\Delta V_{th}$ when the trap is occupied, while $V_{DS}$ and $V_{GS,0}$ remain constant. The device transconductance at the bias point has been independently measured to be $g_m$.\n\nStarting from the definition of transconductance, $g_m \\equiv \\left.\\partial I_D/\\partial V_{GS}\\right|_{V_{DS}}$, and the fact that the drain current $I_D$ of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor depends on the effective gate overdrive through a functional dependence $I_D = F\\!\\left(V_{GS}-V_{th},V_{DS}\\right)$, derive a first-order expression for the magnitude of the RTN step amplitude in drain current, $\\Delta I$, in terms of $g_m$ and $\\Delta V_{th}$ under the assumption that $|\\Delta V_{th}|$ is sufficiently small for linearization about the operating point to be valid. Then evaluate the amplitude numerically for a FinFET with measured $g_m = $ $1.35 \\ \\mathrm{mS}$ at the bias point and an equivalent threshold shift magnitude $|\\Delta V_{th}| = $ $12.8 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$.

            "introduction": "Beyond the transistors themselves, the metallic interconnects that wire them together represent another critical point of failure. This practice shifts focus to electromigration, a wear-out mechanism where the relentless flow of electrons gradually displaces metal atoms, leading to voids and eventual circuit failure. You will apply the celebrated Black's equation, the cornerstone model for electromigration lifetime, to predict how the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) scales with current density ($J$). Mastering this concept is essential for designing robust power grids and signal lines capable of withstanding years of operation.",

The failure rate increases with increasing current density due to enhanced momentum transfer, and increases with temperature due to higher atomic mobility. For two otherwise identical straight interconnect segments (same line width, length, microstructure, interfaces, and barrier conditions), let the current densities be $J_1$ and $J_2$, the effective current exponent be $n$, and the activation energy for the rate-limiting process be $E_a$. Assume both segments are stressed isothermally at temperature $T$, and that the damage rate is proportional to a power law in current density and has Arrhenius temperature dependence.\n\nUsing these fundamentals, derive the scaling of the mean time to failure (MTTF) with $J$ and $T$ and obtain a closed-form expression for the lifetime ratio $R \\equiv \\mathrm{MTTF}_1/\\mathrm{MTTF}_2$ between the two segments in terms of $J_1$, $J_2$, $n$, $E_a$, $T$, and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$.

            "solution": "The problem states that the damage rate is proportional to a power law in current density ($J$) and has an Arrhenius temperature dependence. The mean time to failure (MTTF) is inversely proportional to this damage rate. This relationship is the basis for Black's equation.\n\nFirst, we establish the functional form for the MTTF. The damage rate, $\\mathcal{R}_D$, can be written as:\n$$ \\mathcal{R}_D \\propto J^n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $J$ is the current density, $n$ is the current exponent, $E_a$ is the activation energy for the diffusion process, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe mean time to failure is inversely proportional to the damage rate, as a specific amount of accumulated damage leads to failure.\n$$ \\mathrm{MTTF} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_D} $$\nCombining these proportionalities, we derive the scaling of MTTF with $J$ and $T$, which is Black's equation:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTTF} = A J^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nHere, $A$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on the material properties, geometry, and microstructure of the interconnect line.\n\nThe problem describes two interconnect segments, labeled $1$ and $2$, which are \"otherwise identical\" and stressed isothermally at the same temperature $T$. This means the pre-factor $A$, the activation energy $E_a$, the current exponent $n$, and the temperature $T$ are the same for both segments. The only difference is the current density, which is $J_1$ for segment $1$ and $J_2$ for segment $2$.\n\nWe can write the MTTF for each segment using Black's equation:\nFor segment $1$:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTTF}_1 = A J_1^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nFor segment $2$:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTTF}_2 = A J_2^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n\nThe problem asks for a closed-form expression for the lifetime ratio $R \\equiv \\mathrm{MTTF}_1 / \\mathrm{MTTF}_2$. We can find this by taking the ratio of the two expressions above:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\mathrm{MTTF}_1}{\\mathrm{MTTF}_2} = \\frac{A J_1^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)}{A J_2^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\nSince the pre-factor $A$ and the temperature $T$ are identical for both segments, the term $A$ and the exponential term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)$ cancel out. This is a crucial simplification that arises from the isothermal stress condition. The problem provides values for $E_a$ and $T$, but they are not needed for the calculation of the ratio $R$ under these specific conditions.\n\nThe expression for $R$ simplifies to:\n$$ R = \\frac{J_1^{-n}}{J_2^{-n}} = \\left(\\frac{J_1}{J_2}\\right)^{-n} = \\left(\\frac{J_2}{J_1}\\right)^n $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the lifetime ratio $R$.\n\nNow, we evaluate $R$ using the given numerical values:\n$J_1 = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{MA/cm}^2$\n$J_2 = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{MA/cm}^2$\n$n = 1.1$\n\nThe units of current density ($\\mathrm{MA/cm}^2$) cancel in the ratio $J_2/J_1$.\n$$ R = \\left(\\frac{1.2}{0.8}\\right)^{1.1} = (1.5)^{1.1} $$\nWe can compute this value:\n$$ R = 1.5620803... $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ R \\approx 1.562 $$",
