            "solution": "The problem concerns the asymptotic suppression of the interband envelope overlap in a quantum well under a strong applied electric field and the resulting limit of modulation depth of the ground-state excitonic absorption. The derivation proceeds from the one-dimensional envelope-function Schrödinger equations and the structure of their solutions in linear potentials (triangular wells) near each interface as $F \\to \\infty$.\n\nAt zero field, the potentials $V_{e}(z;0) = V_{c}(z)$ and $V_{h}(z;0) = V_{v}(z)$ are simply square wells. The lowest electron and heavy-hole envelopes, $\\psi_{e}(z;0)$ and $\\psi_{h}(z;0)$, are both centered in the well and have substantial overlap. In the envelope-function approximation for direct-gap semiconductors, the interband oscillator strength of a narrow excitonic transition is proportional to the square of the overlap of the electron and hole envelope functions multiplied by the (field-independent) momentum matrix element between Bloch functions near the band edge.

The boundaries at $z=\\pm L/2$ enforce hard-wall conditions (vanishing wavefunctions) due to very high barriers.

For heavy holes, the potential increases with increasing $z$, so the hole ground state localizes near the left interface at $z=-L/2$. As $F$ increases, these effective triangular wells deepen and narrow, causing the envelopes to concentrate increasingly near their respective interfaces.\n\nMathematically, near each interface where the linear potential confines carriers, the solutions inside a triangular well are Airy functions.

One can bound the overlap integral by integrating this product across the well. Define $d_{e} = y_{e}$ and $d_{h} = y_{h} = L - d_{e}$.

However, because $\\ell_{e}, \\ell_{h} \\to 0$ as $F \\to \\infty$, the minimal value of $\\Phi(d_{e};F)$ scales as $F^{1/2}$ or stronger (specifically $\\sim F^{1/2}$ times a function of $L$, $m_{e}$, and $m_{h}$), driving $\\exp[-\\Phi(d_{e};F)] \\to 0$ faster than any power of $F$ as $F \\to \\infty$. This shows that\n$$\n\\lim_{F \\to \\infty} S(F) = 0.\n$$\nMoreover, the normalization constants $\\mathcal{N}_{e}$ and $\\mathcal{N}_{h}$ remain finite in the strong-field limit because each envelope is normalized within its localized region of width $\\sim \\ell_{e}$ and $\\sim \\ell_{h}$, and thus do not counteract the exponential suppression caused by the separation $L$ between the localization centers.\n\nGiven the proportionality $f(F) \\propto |S(F)|^{2}$, it follows that\n$$\n\\lim_{F \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(F)}{f(0)} = \\frac{\\lim_{F \\to \\infty} |S(F)|^{2}}{|S(0)|^{2}} = 0,\n$$\nsince $|S(0)| > 0$ for the zero-field ground states. Therefore, the modulation depth saturates at\n$$\nM_{\\infty} = \\lim_{F \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{f(F)}{f(0)}\\right) = 1 - 0 = 1.\n$$\n\nThis result represents complete suppression of the ground-state excitonic oscillator strength in the asymptotic strong-field limit within the narrow spectral window considered, because the electron–hole envelope overlap vanishes due to spatial separation induced by the linear potentials and hard-wall boundaries. The stated assumption that bulk-like Franz–Keldysh absorption and tunneling are negligible within this window isolates the resonant excitonic contribution so that $f(F)$ captures the relevant optical strength. Hence the achievable modulation depth of the ground-state excitonic line saturates to the exact dimensionless value $1$.",
