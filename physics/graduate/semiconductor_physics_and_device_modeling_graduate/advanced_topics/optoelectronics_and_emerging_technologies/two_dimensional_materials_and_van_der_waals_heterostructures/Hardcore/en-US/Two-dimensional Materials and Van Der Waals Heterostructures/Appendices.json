In a real-world device based on a two-dimensional material like $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$, these carriers are not in a vacuum; they are scattered by various sources of disorder including lattice vibrations (phonons), charged impurities, and even effects from the underlying substrate. This practice  challenges you to derive and apply Matthiessen's rule, a powerful principle that describes how these independent scattering rates combine to determine the overall, experimentally observable mobility, providing a practical tool for analyzing transistor performance.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of semiconductor physics, well-posed with all necessary information, and stated objectively. We are asked to derive the rule for combining mobilities from different scattering channels and then apply it to find the total mobility of electrons in a monolayer $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$ channel.\n\nThe derivation begins with the Drude model for electrical conductivity, $\\sigma$, in a two-dimensional electron gas. The conductivity is given by the expression:\n$$\n\\sigma = n e \\mu\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the sheet carrier density, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $\\mu$ is the carrier mobility.\n\nThe mobility, $\\mu$, is a measure of how readily a charge carrier moves through a material under the influence of an electric field. It is defined in terms of the average time between scattering events, $\\tau$, and the carrier's effective mass, $m^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{e\\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\n$$\nA higher mobility implies a longer average time between collisions.\n\nThe problem states that the total scattering experienced by an electron is a result of several independent scattering mechanisms. These mechanisms are identified as charged impurity scattering, intrinsic acoustic phonon scattering, and remote interfacial phonon (RIP) scattering. The assumption that these scattering processes are independent and stochastic is critical. It implies that the total probability of being scattered per unit time is the sum of the probabilities of being scattered by each individual mechanism. The probability per unit time of a scattering event is simply the scattering rate, which is the reciprocal of the mean free time between scattering events, $\\tau$.\n\nLet $\\tau_i$ be the average scattering time if only the $i$-th scattering mechanism were present. The corresponding scattering rate is $\\frac{1}{\\tau_i}$. If there are multiple independent scattering mechanisms, the total scattering rate, $\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{total}}}$, is the sum of the individual rates:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\sum_{i} \\frac{1}{\\tau_i}\n$$\nIn our case, the sum is over the three specified channels: impurity ($\\mathrm{imp}$), acoustic phonon ($\\mathrm{ac}$), and remote interfacial phonon ($\\mathrm{RIP}$).\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{ac}}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{RIP}}}\n$$\nWe can relate each scattering time $\\tau_i$ to the mobility $\\mu_i$ that would be observed if only that scattering mechanism were active. From the definition of mobility, we have $\\tau_i = \\frac{\\mu_i m^{\\ast}}{e}$. The total mobility $\\mu_{\\mathrm{total}}$ is related to the total average scattering time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{total}}$ by the same relation: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{total}} m^{\\ast}}{e}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions for $\\tau_i$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{total}}$ into the equation for the sum of scattering rates:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{total}} m^{\\ast}}{e}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{imp}} m^{\\ast}}{e}\\right)} + \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ac}} m^{\\ast}}{e}\\right)} + \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{RIP}} m^{\\ast}}{e}\\right)}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{e}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{total}} m^{\\ast}} = \\frac{e}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{imp}} m^{\\ast}} + \\frac{e}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ac}} m^{\\ast}} + \\frac{e}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{RIP}} m^{\\ast}}\n$$\nThe common factor of $\\frac{e}{m^{\\ast}}$ can be canceled from every term, yielding the combination rule for mobilities, known as Matthiessen's rule:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{imp}}} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ac}}} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{RIP}}}\n$$\nThis is the derived rule for combining mobilities from independent scattering channels.\n\nNow, we apply this rule using the provided numerical values for the channel-resolved mobilities at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n- Impurity-limited mobility: $\\mu_{\\mathrm{imp}} = 70\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Acoustic phonon-limited mobility: $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ac}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- RIP-limited mobility: $\\mu_{\\mathrm{RIP}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into Matthiessen's rule:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{1}{70} + \\frac{1}{300} + \\frac{1}{150}\n$$\nTo sum the fractions, we find a common denominator. The least common multiple of $70$, $300$, and $150$ is $2100$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{30}{2100} + \\frac{7}{2100} + \\frac{14}{2100}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{30 + 7 + 14}{2100} = \\frac{51}{2100}\n$$\nThe units on the right-hand side are $(\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})^{-1}$. Now, we solve for $\\mu_{\\mathrm{total}}$ by taking the reciprocal:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{2100}{51} \\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{total}} \\approx 41.17647... \\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{total}} \\approx 41.2 \\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThis result is physically reasonable. The total mobility is limited by the most dominant scattering mechanism, which is the one with the lowest mobility ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{imp}}=70\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{V}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).

For a single-site contact at device site index $i_{\\alpha}$, $\\Gamma_{\\alpha}$ is a diagonal matrix with element $\\left[\\Gamma_{\\alpha}\\right]_{i_{\\alpha}i_{\\alpha}} = \\gamma_{\\alpha}$ and zeros elsewhere, where $\\gamma_{\\alpha}$ is the scalar broadening parameter in $\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nThe energy-resolved transmission is defined in NEGF by\n$$\nT(E) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{S}}\\,G^{R}(E)\\,\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{D}}\\,G^{A}(E)\\right],\n$$\nwhich follows from the Caroli formula for coherent transport. This quantity is dimensionless and encodes how efficiently states at energy $E$ transmit from source to drain through the device.\n\nThe two-terminal current for a spin-degenerate system (degeneracy factor $2$) is given by the Landauer formula\n$$\nI = \\frac{2q}{h}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\mathrm{d}E_{\\mathrm{J}}\\;T(E)\\,\\left[f\\!\\left(E,\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}},T\\right) - f\\!\\left(E,\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}},T\\right)\\right],\n$$\nwhere $E_{\\mathrm{J}}$ denotes energy in joules, $q$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $f(E,\\mu,T)=\\left[1+\\exp\\left((E-\\mu)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)\\right)\\right]^{-1}$ is the Fermi–Dirac distribution. In our numerical implementation we integrate over energy measured in electronvolts, $E_{\\mathrm{eV}}$. Since $\\mathrm{d}E_{\\mathrm{J}} = q\\,\\mathrm{d}E_{\\mathrm{eV}}$, we rewrite the current as\n$$\nI = \\frac{2q}{h}\\int \\mathrm{d}E_{\\mathrm{J}}\\, T(E)\\,\\Delta f(E) \\;=\\; \\frac{2q}{h}\\int q\\,\\mathrm{d}E_{\\mathrm{eV}}\\, T(E)\\,\\Delta f(E) \\;=\\; \\frac{2q^{2}}{h}\\int \\mathrm{d}E_{\\mathrm{eV}}\\, T(E)\\,\\left[f\\!\\left(E,\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}},T\\right) - f\\!\\left(E,\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}},T\\right)\\right],\n$$\nwith all energies inside $f(\\cdot)$ consistently in $\\mathrm{eV}$. The prefactor $2q^{2}/h$ has units of siemens, ensuring that the integral over energy in $\\mathrm{eV}$ yields current in amperes.\n\nFor the device Hamiltonian, we use the specified $4\\times 4$ tight-binding matrix with\n- $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{G}} = 0.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ at indices $0$ and $3$,\n- $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{B}} = +3.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ at index $1$,\n- $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{N}} = -1.5\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ at index $2$,\n- $t_{\\mathrm{G\\text{-}hBN}} = -0.3\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ between $\\left(0,1\\right)$ and $\\left(2,3\\right)$,\n- $t_{\\mathrm{hBN}} = -2.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ between $\\left(1,2\\right)$,\nand zeros elsewhere. The broadening matrices are diagonal with $\\left[\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right]_{00}=\\gamma_{\\mathrm{S}}$, $\\left[\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{D}}\\right]_{33}=\\gamma_{\\mathrm{D}}$, and all other elements zero. The retarded self-energies are $\\Sigma^{R}_{\\mathrm{S}}=-\\mathrm{i}\\,\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{S}}/2$ and $\\Sigma^{R}_{\\mathrm{D}}=-\\mathrm{i}\\,\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{D}}/2$.\n\nAlgorithmic steps:\n- Construct $H$ as a real symmetric matrix in $\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- For each test case, build $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{S}}$ and $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{D}}$ from the given scalar broadenings and compute $\\Sigma^{R}_{\\mathrm{S}}$ and $\\Sigma^{R}_{\\mathrm{D}}$.\n- Define the energy grid $E = E_{\\min}, E_{\\min}+\\Delta E, \\ldots, E_{\\max}$ with $E_{\\min}=-4.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, $E_{\\max}=+4.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, and $\\Delta E = 0.002\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n- For each $E$ on the grid, compute $G^{R}(E)$ and $G^{A}(E)$, then evaluate $T(E)=\\mathrm{Tr}\\!\\left[\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{S}}\\,G^{R}(E)\\,\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{D}}\\,G^{A}(E)\\right]$.\n- Compute the Fermi functions $f\\!\\left(E,\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}},T\\right)$ and $f\\!\\left(E,\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}},T\\right)$ with $k_{\\mathrm{B}}=8.617333262\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{eV/K}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}=E_{\\mathrm{F}}+V/2$, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}}=E_{\\mathrm{F}}-V/2$, using $E_{\\mathrm{F}}=0.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n- Numerically integrate using the trapezoidal rule to obtain\n$$\nI \\approx \\frac{2q^{2}}{h}\\sum_{n} T(E_{n})\\left[f(E_{n},\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}},T) - f(E_{n},\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}},T)\\right]\\Delta E,\n$$\nwhich yields current in $\\mathrm{A}$ because the prefactor $\\left(2q^{2}/h\\right)$ has units of $\\mathrm{A/V}$ and $\\Delta E$ is in $\\mathrm{eV}$, effectively incorporating the conversion factor $q$ from $\\mathrm{eV}$ to $\\mathrm{J}$.\n- Evaluate the transmission at $E_{0}=0.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ directly via the same expression for $T(E)$.\n\nEdge-case considerations:\n- In the zero-bias limit ($V=0.0\\ \\mathrm{V}$), the integrand is antisymmetric and the Fermi functions are equal, yielding $I\\to 0$ up to numerical precision.\n- If $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{D}}=0.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, then $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{D}}=0$ implies $T(E)=0$ for all $E$, thus $I=0$ exactly up to machine precision.\n- A small $\\eta=1.0\\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ is added to stabilize matrix inversions, without affecting results at the provided resolution.\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each test case, output a list $[T(E_{0}), I]$ where $T(E_{0})$ is dimensionless and $I$ is in $\\mathrm{A}$.\n- Aggregate the three case results in order into a single list and print exactly one line in the format $[[T_{1},I_{1}],[T_{2},I_{2}],[T_{3},I_{3}]]$.\n\nThe provided program constructs $H$, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{S}}$, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{D}}$, computes $T(E)$ on the specified grid, evaluates $T(E_{0})$ and the current for each case, and prints the results with a consistent numeric format. The numerical integration grid $E\\in[-4.0,4.0]\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ with $\\Delta E=0.002\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ is sufficient to capture the relevant features of $T(E)$ for the specified tight-binding parameters. The use of explicit matrix operations ensures the results adhere to the NEGF formalism starting from fundamental definitions of Green's functions, self-energies in the wide-band limit, and the Landauer current formula.",
