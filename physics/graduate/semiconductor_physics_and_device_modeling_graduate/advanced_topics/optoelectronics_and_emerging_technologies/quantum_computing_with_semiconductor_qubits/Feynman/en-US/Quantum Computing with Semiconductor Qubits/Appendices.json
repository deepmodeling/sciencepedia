A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: $\\pi$-Pulse Duration**\n\nFor a two-level quantum system driven by a resonant electromagnetic field, the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame, under the Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA), is given by:\n$$\nH(t) = \\frac{\\hbar \\Omega(t)}{2} \\sigma_x\n$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\Omega(t)$ is the time-dependent Rabi frequency, which is proportional to the amplitude of the drive field, and $\\sigma_x$ is the Pauli-X matrix. The basis states are typically chosen as the eigenstates of $\\sigma_z$, denoted by $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.\n\nFor a rectangular pulse of duration $\\tau$, the Rabi frequency is constant, $\\Omega(t) = \\Omega$ for $0 \\le t \\le \\tau$. The Hamiltonian becomes time-independent during the pulse:\n$$\nH = \\frac{\\hbar \\Omega}{2} \\sigma_x\n$$\nThe evolution of the quantum state $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$ is governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, whose solution is given by the application of the time evolution operator $U(t)$:\n$$\n|\\psi(t)\\rangle = U(t) |\\psi(0)\\rangle = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i H t}{\\hbar}\\right) |\\psi(0)\\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H$, we get:\n$$\nU(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\frac{\\hbar \\Omega t}{2} \\sigma_x\\right) = \\exp\\left(-i \\frac{\\Omega t}{2} \\sigma_x\\right)\n$$\nUsing the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix, $\\exp(i\\theta \\hat{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}) = I\\cos(\\theta) + i(\\hat{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})\\sin(\\theta)$, with $\\theta = -\\frac{\\Omega t}{2}$ and $\\hat{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma} = \\sigma_x$:\n$$\nU(t) = I\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\Omega t}{2}\\right) - i\\sigma_x\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Omega t}{2}\\right)\n$$\nA population inversion, or a $\\pi$-rotation, corresponds to driving the system from the initial state $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |0\\rangle$ to the final state $|\\psi(\\tau_\\pi)\\rangle$, which is proportional to $|1\\rangle$. Applying the operator $U(\\tau_\\pi)$ for a pulse of duration $\\tau_\\pi$:\n$$\n|\\psi(\\tau_\\pi)\\rangle = U(\\tau_\\pi) |0\\rangle = \\left( I\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\Omega \\tau_\\pi}{2}\\right) - i\\sigma_x\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Omega \\tau_\\pi}{2}\\right) \\right) |0\\rangle\n$$\nUsing the relations $I|0\\rangle = |0\\rangle$ and $\\sigma_x|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle$, we obtain:\n$$\n|\\psi(\\tau_\\pi)\\rangle = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\Omega \\tau_\\pi}{2}\\right)|0\\rangle - i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Omega \\tau_\\pi}{2}\\right)|1\\rangle\n$$\nFor a complete population inversion, the component along $|0\\rangle$ must vanish:\n$$\n\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\Omega \\tau_\\pi}{2}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe shortest positive duration $\\tau_\\pi$ that satisfies this condition is when the argument of the cosine is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Omega \\tau_\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\implies \\Omega \\tau_\\pi = \\pi\n$$\nThe quantity $\\int_0^\\tau \\Omega(t) dt$ is known as the pulse area. A $\\pi$-pulse has a pulse area of $\\pi$. From this condition, we can find the duration $\\tau_\\pi$:\n$$\n\\tau_\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Omega}\n$$\nThe problem provides the resonant Rabi rate $\\frac{\\Omega}{2\\pi} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{MHz} = 10 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

The adiabatic theorem states that a system will remain in an instantaneous eigenstate of a slowly varying Hamiltonian. A common criterion for adiabaticity is that the characteristic rate of change of the Hamiltonian must be much smaller than the frequency corresponding to the energy gap between the relevant instantaneous eigenstates.\n\nThe instantaneous energy gap of our system is $\\Delta E(t) = \\hbar \\Omega(t)$. The associated dynamical frequency is $\\frac{\\Delta E(t)}{\\hbar} = \\Omega(t)$.\nThe rate of change of the Hamiltonian can be characterized by its time derivative, $\\dot{H}(t) = \\frac{\\hbar \\dot{\\Omega}(t)}{2}\\sigma_x$. A dimensionless parameter comparing these scales can be formed. A generalized adiabaticity condition is often expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\dot{\\Omega}(t)|}{\\Omega(t)^2} \\ll 1\n$$\nThis condition requires that the rate of change of the Rabi frequency, $\\dot{\\Omega}(t)$, is small compared to the square of its instantaneous value.\nThe problem requires the condition for *non-adiabatic* switching, which is the opposite of the adiabatic condition:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\dot{\\Omega}(t)|}{\\Omega(t)^2} \\gtrsim 1\n$$\nFor our linear ramp, the rate of change is constant: $\\dot{\\Omega}(t) = \\frac{\\Omega}{t_r}$.\nThe condition becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Omega/t_r}{(\\Omega t/t_r)^2} = \\frac{\\Omega}{t_r} \\frac{t_r^2}{\\Omega^2 t^2} = \\frac{t_r}{\\Omega t^2} \\gtrsim 1\n$$\nThe problem states that this condition should be evaluated \"at the target amplitude,\" which corresponds to the end of the ramp at time $t=t_r$, where $\\Omega(t_r) = \\Omega$. Evaluating the non-adiabaticity condition $\\frac{\\dot{\\Omega}(t)}{\\Omega(t)^2} \\gtrsim 1$ at $t=t_r$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Omega/t_r}{\\Omega^2} \\gtrsim 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\Omega t_r} \\gtrsim 1 \\implies t_r \\lesssim \\frac{1}{\\Omega}\n$$\nThis inequality gives the criterion on $t_r$ for non-adiabatic switching. The maximal allowed rise time, $t_{r, \\text{max}}$, is at the boundary of this condition:\n$$\nt_{r, \\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{\\Omega}\n$$\nUsing the value of $\\Omega$ from Part 1:\n$$\nt_{r, \\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{20\\pi \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 1.591549... \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 15.915... \\ \\mathrm{ns}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the maximal rise time is $15.9 \\ \\mathrm{ns}$.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of calculated values: $(\\tau_\\pi, t_{r, \\text{max}})$.",

Substituting this back into the qubit’s equation of motion and tracing out the bath, the effective qubit dynamics acquires a decay term whose rate is given by the real part of the self-energy induced by the damped resonator. The resulting qubit energy relaxation rate into the resonator’s bath (Purcell decay rate) is\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{Purcell}} = \\frac{g^{2}\\,\\kappa}{\\Delta^{2} + (\\kappa/2)^{2}}.\n$$\nIn the dispersive limit $\\,|\\Delta| \\gg \\kappa\\,$, this simplifies to the well-tested form\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{Purcell}} \\approx \\left( \\frac{g}{\\Delta} \\right)^{2} \\kappa,\n$$\nand the corresponding energy relaxation time is\n$$\nT_{1,\\mathrm{Purcell}} = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{Purcell}}}.\n$$\n\nWe now evaluate $\\,\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{Purcell}}\\,$ and $\\,T_{1,\\mathrm{Purcell}}\\,$ with the provided parameters, keeping quantities symbolic until the final step.\n\nGiven\n$$\n\\omega_{q} = 2\\pi \\times 7.900~\\mathrm{GHz}, \\quad \\omega_{r} = 2\\pi \\times 7.000~\\mathrm{GHz},\n$$\nthe detuning is\n$$\n\\Delta = \\omega_{q} - \\omega_{r} = 2\\pi \\times (7.900 - 7.000)~\\mathrm{GHz} = 2\\pi \\times 0.900~\\mathrm{GHz}.\n$$\nThe qubit–resonator coupling is\n$$\ng = 2\\pi \\times 45~\\mathrm{MHz}.\n$$\nThe resonator quality factor $\\,Q = 7000\\,$ implies\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{\\omega_{r}}{Q} = \\frac{2\\pi \\times 7.000~\\mathrm{GHz}}{7000} = 2\\pi \\times 1.000~\\mathrm{MHz}.\n$$\n\nSince $\\,|\\Delta| = 2\\pi \\times 0.900~\\mathrm{GHz}\\,$ is much larger than $\\,\\kappa = 2\\pi \\times 1.000~\\mathrm{MHz}\\,$, the dispersive-limit approximation is appropriate. Using\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{Purcell}} \\approx \\left( \\frac{g}{\\Delta} \\right)^{2} \\kappa,\n$$\nfirst compute the ratio\n$$\n\\frac{g}{\\Delta} = \\frac{2\\pi \\times 45~\\mathrm{MHz}}{2\\pi \\times 900~\\mathrm{MHz}} = \\frac{45}{900} = 0.05,\n$$\nso that\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{g}{\\Delta} \\right)^{2} = 0.05^{2} = 0.0025.\n$$\nThen\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{Purcell}} \\approx 0.0025 \\times \\kappa = 0.0025 \\times (2\\pi \\times 1.000~\\mathrm{MHz}) = 0.0025 \\times (2\\pi \\times 10^{6}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}).\n$$\nRecognizing $\\,2\\pi \\approx 6.283185307\\,$,\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{Purcell}} \\approx 0.0025 \\times 6.283185307 \\times 10^{6}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 1.570796327 \\times 10^{4}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nT_{1,\\mathrm{Purcell}} = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{Purcell}}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1.570796327 \\times 10^{4}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 6.366197723 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{s}.\n$$\nExpressed in microseconds,\n$$\nT_{1,\\mathrm{Purcell}} \\approx 63.66197723~\\mu\\mathrm{s}.\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures,\n$$\nT_{1,\\mathrm{Purcell}} \\approx 63.66~\\mu\\mathrm{s}.\n$$",
