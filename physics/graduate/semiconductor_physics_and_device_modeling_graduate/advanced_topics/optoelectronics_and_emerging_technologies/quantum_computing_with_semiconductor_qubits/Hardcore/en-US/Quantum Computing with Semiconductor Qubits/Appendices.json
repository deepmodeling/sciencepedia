A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: $\\pi$-Pulse Duration**\n\nFor a two-level quantum system driven by a resonant electromagnetic field, the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame, under the Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA), is given by:\n$$\nH(t) = \\frac{\\hbar \\Omega(t)}{2} \\sigma_x\n$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\Omega(t)$ is the time-dependent Rabi frequency, which is proportional to the amplitude of the drive field, and $\\sigma_x$ is the Pauli-X matrix. The basis states are typically chosen as the eigenstates of $\\sigma_z$, denoted by $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.\n\nFor a rectangular pulse of duration $\\tau$, the Rabi frequency is constant, $\\Omega(t) = \\Omega$ for $0 \\le t \\le \\tau$. The Hamiltonian becomes time-independent during the pulse:\n$$\nH = \\frac{\\hbar \\Omega}{2} \\sigma_x\n$$\nThe evolution of the quantum state $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$ is governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, whose solution is given by the application of the time evolution operator $U(t)$:\n$$\n|\\psi(t)\\rangle = U(t) |\\psi(0)\\rangle = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i H t}{\\hbar}\\right) |\\psi(0)\\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H$, we get:\n$$\nU(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\frac{\\hbar \\Omega t}{2} \\sigma_x\\right) = \\exp\\left(-i \\frac{\\Omega t}{2} \\sigma_x\\right)\n$$\nUsing the identity for the exponential of a Pauli matrix, $\\exp(i\\theta \\hat{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}) = I\\cos(\\theta) + i(\\hat{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})\\sin(\\theta)$, with $\\theta = -\\frac{\\Omega t}{2}$ and $\\hat{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma} = \\sigma_x$:\n$$\nU(t) = I\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\Omega t}{2}\\right) - i\\sigma_x\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Omega t}{2}\\right)\n$$\nA population inversion, or a $\\pi$-rotation, corresponds to driving the system from the initial state $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |0\\rangle$ to the final state $|\\psi(\\tau_\\pi)\\rangle$, which is proportional to $|1\\rangle$. Applying the operator $U(\\tau_\\pi)$ for a pulse of duration $\\tau_\\pi$:\n$$\n|\\psi(\\tau_\\pi)\\rangle = U(\\tau_\\pi) |0\\rangle = \\left( I\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\Omega \\tau_\\pi}{2}\\right) - i\\sigma_x\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Omega \\tau_\\pi}{2}\\right) \\right) |0\\rangle\n$$\nUsing the relations $I|0\\rangle = |0\\rangle$ and $\\sigma_x|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle$, we obtain:\n$$\n|\\psi(\\tau_\\pi)\\rangle = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\Omega \\tau_\\pi}{2}\\right)|0\\rangle - i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Omega \\tau_\\pi}{2}\\right)|1\\rangle\n$$\nFor a complete population inversion, the component along $|0\\rangle$ must vanish:\n$$\n\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\Omega \\tau_\\pi}{2}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe shortest positive duration $\\tau_\\pi$ that satisfies this condition is when the argument of the cosine is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Omega \\tau_\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\implies \\Omega \\tau_\\pi = \\pi\n$$\nThe quantity $\\int_0^\\tau \\Omega(t) dt$ is known as the pulse area. A $\\pi$-pulse has a pulse area of $\\pi$. From this condition, we can find the duration $\\tau_\\pi$:\n$$\n\\tau_\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Omega}\n$$\nThe problem provides the resonant Rabi rate $\\frac{\\Omega}{2\\pi} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{MHz} = 10 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

The adiabatic theorem states that a system will remain in an instantaneous eigenstate of a slowly varying Hamiltonian. A common criterion for adiabaticity is that the characteristic rate of change of the Hamiltonian must be much smaller than the frequency corresponding to the energy gap between the relevant instantaneous eigenstates.\n\nThe instantaneous energy gap of our system is $\\Delta E(t) = \\hbar \\Omega(t)$. The associated dynamical frequency is $\\frac{\\Delta E(t)}{\\hbar} = \\Omega(t)$.\nThe rate of change of the Hamiltonian can be characterized by its time derivative, $\\dot{H}(t) = \\frac{\\hbar \\dot{\\Omega}(t)}{2}\\sigma_x$. A dimensionless parameter comparing these scales can be formed. A generalized adiabaticity condition is often expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\dot{\\Omega}(t)|}{\\Omega(t)^2} \\ll 1\n$$\nThis condition requires that the rate of change of the Rabi frequency, $\\dot{\\Omega}(t)$, is small compared to the square of its instantaneous value.\nThe problem requires the condition for *non-adiabatic* switching, which is the opposite of the adiabatic condition:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\dot{\\Omega}(t)|}{\\Omega(t)^2} \\gtrsim 1\n$$\nFor our linear ramp, the rate of change is constant: $\\dot{\\Omega}(t) = \\frac{\\Omega}{t_r}$.\nThe condition becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Omega/t_r}{(\\Omega t/t_r)^2} = \\frac{\\Omega}{t_r} \\frac{t_r^2}{\\Omega^2 t^2} = \\frac{t_r}{\\Omega t^2} \\gtrsim 1\n$$\nThe problem states that this condition should be evaluated \"at the target amplitude,\" which corresponds to the end of the ramp at time $t=t_r$, where $\\Omega(t_r) = \\Omega$. Evaluating the non-adiabaticity condition $\\frac{\\dot{\\Omega}(t)}{\\Omega(t)^2} \\gtrsim 1$ at $t=t_r$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Omega/t_r}{\\Omega^2} \\gtrsim 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\Omega t_r} \\gtrsim 1 \\implies t_r \\lesssim \\frac{1}{\\Omega}\n$$\nThis inequality gives the criterion on $t_r$ for non-adiabatic switching. The maximal allowed rise time, $t_{r, \\text{max}}$, is at the boundary of this condition:\n$$\nt_{r, \\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{\\Omega}\n$$\nUsing the value of $\\Omega$ from Part 1:\n$$\nt_{r, \\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{20\\pi \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 1.591549... \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 15.915... \\ \\mathrm{ns}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the maximal rise time is $15.9 \\ \\mathrm{ns}$.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of calculated values: $(\\tau_\\pi, t_{r, \\text{max}})$.",

The adjoint of $U_0$ is:\n$$U_{0}^{\\dagger} = (e^{-i\\pi/8} P_T + e^{i3\\pi/8} P_S)^{\\dagger} = e^{i\\pi/8} P_T + e^{-i3\\pi/8} P_S$$\nThen, the product is:\n$$U_{0}^{\\dagger} U = (e^{i\\pi/8} P_T + e^{-i3\\pi/8} P_S)(e^{-i\\phi/4} P_T + e^{i3\\phi/4} P_S)$$\nUsing the orthogonality of the projectors:\n$$U_{0}^{\\dagger} U = e^{i\\pi/8}e^{-i\\phi/4} P_T + e^{-i3\\pi/8}e^{i3\\phi/4} P_S$$\n$$U_{0}^{\\dagger} U = \\exp\\left(-i\\frac{\\phi - \\pi/2}{4}\\right) P_T + \\exp\\left(i\\frac{3(\\phi - \\pi/2)}{4}\\right) P_S$$\nSubstituting $\\Delta\\phi = \\phi - \\phi_0 = \\phi - \\pi/2$:\n$$U_{0}^{\\dagger} U = \\exp\\left(-i\\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{4}\\right) P_T + \\exp\\left(i\\frac{3\\Delta\\phi}{4}\\right) P_S$$\nNext, we take the trace. The trace of a projector is the dimension of the subspace it projects onto. Thus, $\\text{Tr}(P_T) = 3$ and $\\text{Tr}(P_S) = 1$.\n$$\\text{Tr}(U_{0}^{\\dagger} U) = 3 \\exp\\left(-i\\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{4}\\right) + 1 \\exp\\left(i\\frac{3\\Delta\\phi}{4}\\right)$$\nNow we calculate the fidelity for a given error $\\Delta\\phi$:\n$$F_e(\\Delta\\phi) = \\left|\\frac{1}{4} \\left(3e^{-i\\Delta\\phi/4} + e^{i3\\Delta\\phi/4}\\right)\\right|^2$$\nThe squared magnitude is:\n$$|3e^{-i\\Delta\\phi/4} + e^{i3\\Delta\\phi/4}|^2 = (3e^{-i\\Delta\\phi/4} + e^{i3\\Delta\\phi/4})(3e^{i\\Delta\\phi/4} + e^{-i3\\Delta\\phi/4})$$\n$$= 9 + 3e^{-i\\Delta\\phi/4}e^{-i3\\Delta\\phi/4} + 3e^{i3\\Delta\\phi/4}e^{i\\Delta\\phi/4} + 1$$\n$$= 10 + 3e^{-i\\Delta\\phi} + 3e^{i\\Delta\\phi} = 10 + 3(2\\cos(\\Delta\\phi)) = 10 + 6\\cos(\\Delta\\phi)$$\nSo, the fidelity is:\n$$F_e(\\Delta\\phi) = \\frac{1}{16}(10 + 6\\cos(\\Delta\\phi)) = \\frac{5 + 3\\cos(\\Delta\\phi)}{8}$$\nThe problem requires this fidelity to be averaged over the quasi-static detuning fluctuations $\\delta\\epsilon$. The total angle error is $\\Delta\\phi = \\delta_c + g\\delta\\epsilon$. Since $\\delta\\epsilon$ is drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation $\\sigma_\\epsilon$, i.e., $\\delta\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_\\epsilon^2)$, the total error $\\Delta\\phi$ is also a Gaussian random variable.\nThe mean of $\\Delta\\phi$ is $\\mu_{\\Delta\\phi} = \\mathbb{E}[\\delta_c + g\\delta\\epsilon] = \\delta_c + g\\mathbb{E}[\\delta\\epsilon] = \\delta_c$.\nThe variance of $\\Delta\\phi$ is $\\sigma_{\\Delta\\phi}^2 = \\text{Var}(\\delta_c + g\\delta\\epsilon) = g^2\\text{Var}(\\delta\\epsilon) = g^2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2$.\nSo, $\\Delta\\phi \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\delta_c, g^2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2)$.\n\nWe need to compute the average fidelity $\\langle F_e \\rangle = \\mathbb{E}_{\\Delta\\phi}[F_e(\\Delta\\phi)]$.\n$$\\langle F_e \\rangle = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{5 + 3\\cos(\\Delta\\phi)}{8}\\right] = \\frac{5}{8} + \\frac{3}{8}\\mathbb{E}[\\cos(\\Delta\\phi)]$$\nTo find $\\mathbb{E}[\\cos(\\Delta\\phi)]$, we use the characteristic function of a normal distribution. For a random variable $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, its characteristic function is $\\Phi_X(t) = \\mathbb{E}[e^{itX}] = \\exp(i\\mu t - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2t^2)$.\nWe can write $\\mathbb{E}[\\cos(\\Delta\\phi)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\text{Re}(e^{i\\Delta\\phi})] = \\text{Re}(\\mathbb{E}[e^{i\\Delta\\phi}])$.\n$\\mathbb{E}[e^{i\\Delta\\phi}]$ is the characteristic function of $\\Delta\\phi$ evaluated at $t=1$.\nWith $\\mu = \\delta_c$ and $\\sigma^2 = g^2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[e^{i\\Delta\\phi}] = \\exp\\left(i\\delta_c \\cdot 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(g\\sigma_\\epsilon)^2 \\cdot 1^2\\right) = \\exp\\left(i\\delta_c - \\frac{g^2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2}{2}\\right)$$\nTaking the real part:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\cos(\\Delta\\phi)] = \\text{Re}\\left(e^{i\\delta_c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g^2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\cos(\\delta_c) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g^2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2}{2}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the average fidelity, we obtain the final result:\n$$F_e(\\delta_c, \\sigma_\\epsilon, g) = \\frac{5}{8} + \\frac{3}{8}\\cos(\\delta_c)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{g^2\\sigma_\\epsilon^2}{2}\\right)$$\nThis expression represents the entanglement fidelity averaged over the Gaussian detuning noise, as a function of the coherent error $\\delta_c$, the noise standard deviation $\\sigma_\\epsilon$, and the gate sensitivity $g$.\n\nSeparately, as requested, here are brief proposals for mitigation strategies. To mitigate the coherent over-rotation error $\\delta_c$, one can perform calibration routines such as exchange-driven Ramsey interferometry. By measuring the phase accumulated as a function of the pulse duration or amplitude, one can precisely tune the control parameters to achieve the target angle $\\phi_0 = \\pi/2$, thus nullifying $\\delta_c$. To reduce the sensitivity $g = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial\\epsilon}|_{\\epsilon_0}$, one can operate the device at a \"sweet spot\", i.e., at a detuning value $\\epsilon_0$ where the exchange coupling $J(\\epsilon)$ has an extremum, making $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial\\epsilon}|_{\\epsilon_0}=0$. This makes the gate first-order insensitive to detuning fluctuations. Another advanced method involves using dynamically corrected gate pulses, where the pulse shape $\\epsilon(t)$ is designed using optimal control theory to minimize the sensitivity of the final gate operation to noise.",
