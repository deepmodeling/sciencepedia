            "problem": "Consider a lateral four-terminal nonlocal spin valve geometry formed by a nonmagnetic semiconductor channel and two ferromagnetic contacts. The nonmagnetic (NM) channel is quasi-one-dimensional along the coordinate $x$, with uniform electrical conductivity $\\sigma$, cross-sectional area $A$, spin diffusion coefficient $D$, and spin relaxation time $\\tau_{s}$. The spin diffusion length is defined by $\\lambda_{s} = \\sqrt{D \\tau_{s}}$. A ferromagnet (FM) injector at $x=0$ drives a steady-state spin accumulation in the NM channel characterized by the spin-split electrochemical potential difference $\\mu_{s}(x) \\equiv \\mu_{\\uparrow}(x) - \\mu_{\\downarrow}(x)$, where $\\mu_{\\uparrow}$ and $\\mu_{\\downarrow}$ denote the electrochemical potentials for spin-up and spin-down electrons, respectively. The injector establishes a boundary condition $\\mu_{s}(0) = \\mu_{0}$, and the channel is sufficiently long and homogeneous that $\\mu_{s}(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. A second FM detector contact is placed at $x=L$ and is connected to a voltmeter with effectively infinite input impedance, so the detector circuit enforces zero net charge current across the FM/NM interface at $x=L$.\n\nAssume the FM detector has spin-dependent interface conductances $G_{\\uparrow}$ and $G_{\\downarrow}$ for spin-up and spin-down channels, respectively, and define the detector polarization $P_{D}$ by $P_{D} = \\left(G_{\\uparrow} - G_{\\downarrow}\\right)/\\left(G_{\\uparrow} + G_{\\downarrow}\\right)$. In the detector FM, spin relaxation is fast, so any spin accumulation within the FM vanishes at steady state near the interface, and the FM is described by a single average electrochemical potential $\\bar{\\mu}^{F}$. Let the average electrochemical potential in the NM channel just beneath the detector be $\\bar{\\mu}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L)$, and denote the steady-state spin accumulation at the detector position as $\\mu_{s}(L)$.\n\nStarting from the spin continuity equation and Fick’s law (diffusive transport), derive the steady-state spatial profile of $\\mu_{s}(x)$ in the NM channel and the open-circuit condition required at the detector. Then use the two-current interface model to obtain the nonlocal voltage $V_{\\mathrm{nl}}(L) \\equiv \\left[\\bar{\\mu}^{F} - \\bar{\\mu}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L)\\right]/e$ in terms of $\\mu_{0}$, $L$, $\\lambda_{s}$, $e$, and $P_{D}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression. Predict, from your derived expression, how $V_{\\mathrm{nl}}$ scales with the injector-detector separation $L$ under these assumptions. If you introduce any intermediate parameters, they must be defined within the derivation.\n\nNo numerical evaluation is required; provide the symbolic expression for $V_{\\mathrm{nl}}(L)$ only. The scaling prediction must follow from the derived expression, but the final answer must be the expression for $V_{\\mathrm{nl}}(L)$ itself. State no units inside the final answer; the physical unit of $V_{\\mathrm{nl}}$ is volts.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established principles of spintronics, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of conditions, and objectively stated. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation consists of two main parts: first, determining the spatial profile of the spin accumulation in the nonmagnetic (NM) channel, and second, using the two-current model at the detector interface to find the nonlocal voltage.\n\nPart 1: Spin Accumulation Profile $\\mu_{s}(x)$\n\nThe transport of spin accumulation in the NM channel is governed by the steady-state one-dimensional spin diffusion equation for the spin-split chemical potential $\\mu_s(x) = \\mu_\\uparrow(x) - \\mu_\\downarrow(x)$:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\mu_s}{dx^2} = \\frac{\\mu_s}{D\\tau_s}$$\nThis equation combines Fick's law for the spin current ($J_s \\propto d\\mu_s/dx$) with the continuity equation that accounts for spin relaxation over a time $\\tau_s$. The derivation of this standard equation relies on the Einstein relation and the definition of spin density in terms of $\\mu_s$.\n\nUsing the definition of the spin diffusion length, $\\lambda_{s} = \\sqrt{D \\tau_{s}}$, we have:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}\\mu_{s}}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{s}^{2}} \\mu_{s} = 0$$\nThe general solution to this second-order linear ordinary differential equation is:\n$$\\mu_{s}(x) = C_{1} \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) + C_{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right)$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants determined by the boundary conditions. The problem states two boundary conditions:\n1.  At the injector, $x=0$, the spin accumulation is $\\mu_{s}(0) = \\mu_{0}$.\n2.  Far from the injector, as $x \\to \\infty$, the spin accumulation vanishes: $\\mu_{s}(x) \\to 0$.\n\nFrom the second condition, the term $C_{1} \\exp(x/\\lambda_{s})$ must be zero for large positive $x$. Since $\\exp(x/\\lambda_{s})$ diverges as $x \\to \\infty$, we must have $C_{1} = 0$.\nThe solution thus simplifies to $\\mu_{s}(x) = C_{2} \\exp(-x/\\lambda_{s})$.\nApplying the first condition at $x=0$:\n$$\\mu_{s}(0) = C_{2} \\exp(0) = C_{2} = \\mu_{0}$$\nTherefore, the spatial profile of the spin accumulation in the NM channel is:\n$$\\mu_{s}(x) = \\mu_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right)$$\nAt the detector position $x=L$, the spin accumulation is:\n$$\\mu_{s}(L) = \\mu_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right)$$\n\nPart 2: Nonlocal Voltage $V_{\\mathrm{nl}}(L)$\n\nThe nonlocal voltage is measured at the detector at $x=L$. We use the two-current model for the interface between the FM detector and the NM channel. The spin-dependent currents flowing across the interface are given by:\n$$I_{\\uparrow}(L) = G_{\\uparrow} \\left(\\mu_{\\uparrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) - \\mu_{\\uparrow}^{F}\\right)$$\n$$I_{\\downarrow}(L) = G_{\\downarrow} \\left(\\mu_{\\downarrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) - \\mu_{\\downarrow}^{F}\\right)$$\nwhere $G_{\\uparrow}$ and $G_{\\downarrow}$ are the interface conductances for spin-up and spin-down electrons, respectively. In the channel at $x=L$, we have the spin-split potentials $\\mu_{\\uparrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L)$ and $\\mu_{\\downarrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L)$. In the FM detector, due to fast spin relaxation, there is a single average electrochemical potential $\\bar{\\mu}^{F}$, so $\\mu_{\\uparrow}^{F} = \\mu_{\\downarrow}^{F} = \\bar{\\mu}^{F}$.\n\nThe detector circuit is open, meaning the net charge current flowing into the detector is zero. This is the required open-circuit condition:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{charge}}(L) = I_{\\uparrow}(L) + I_{\\downarrow}(L) = 0$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the currents:\n$$G_{\\uparrow} \\left(\\mu_{\\uparrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) - \\bar{\\mu}^{F}\\right) + G_{\\downarrow} \\left(\\mu_{\\downarrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) - \\bar{\\mu}^{F}\\right) = 0$$\nSolving for $\\bar{\\mu}^{F}$:\n$$G_{\\uparrow} \\mu_{\\uparrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) + G_{\\downarrow} \\mu_{\\downarrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) = \\left(G_{\\uparrow} + G_{\\downarrow}\\right) \\bar{\\mu}^{F}$$\n$$\\bar{\\mu}^{F} = \\frac{G_{\\uparrow} \\mu_{\\uparrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) + G_{\\downarrow} \\mu_{\\downarrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L)}{G_{\\uparrow} + G_{\\downarrow}}$$\nThe spin-split potentials in the channel can be expressed in terms of the average potential $\\bar{\\mu}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) = (\\mu_{\\uparrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) + \\mu_{\\downarrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L))/2$ and the spin accumulation $\\mu_{s}(L) = \\mu_{\\uparrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) - \\mu_{\\downarrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L)$:\n$$\\mu_{\\uparrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) = \\bar{\\mu}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{s}(L)$$\n$$\\mu_{\\downarrow}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) = \\bar{\\mu}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) - \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{s}(L)$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\bar{\\mu}^{F}$:\n$$\\bar{\\mu}^{F} = \\frac{G_{\\uparrow} \\left(\\bar{\\mu}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{s}(L)\\right) + G_{\\downarrow} \\left(\\bar{\\mu}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) - \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{s}(L)\\right)}{G_{\\uparrow} + G_{\\downarrow}}$$\n$$\\bar{\\mu}^{F} = \\frac{\\left(G_{\\uparrow} + G_{\\downarrow}\\right)\\bar{\\mu}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(G_{\\uparrow} - G_{\\downarrow}\\right)\\mu_{s}(L)}{G_{\\uparrow} + G_{\\downarrow}}$$\n$$\\bar{\\mu}^{F} = \\bar{\\mu}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{G_{\\uparrow} - G_{\\downarrow}}{G_{\\uparrow} + G_{\\downarrow}} \\mu_{s}(L)$$\nUsing the definition of the detector polarization, $P_{D} = (G_{\\uparrow} - G_{\\downarrow})/(G_{\\uparrow} + G_{\\downarrow})$, we find:\n$$\\bar{\\mu}^{F} - \\bar{\\mu}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L) = \\frac{1}{2} P_{D} \\mu_{s}(L)$$\nThe nonlocal voltage is defined as $V_{\\mathrm{nl}}(L) = [\\bar{\\mu}^{F} - \\bar{\\mu}^{\\mathrm{ch}}(L)]/e$. Therefore:\n$$e V_{\\mathrm{nl}}(L) = \\frac{1}{2} P_{D} \\mu_{s}(L)$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{nl}}(L) = \\frac{P_{D} \\mu_{s}(L)}{2e}$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\mu_s(L)$ derived in the first part:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{nl}}(L) = \\frac{P_{D}}{2e} \\left[ \\mu_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) \\right]$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the nonlocal voltage.\n\nFrom this expression, we can predict the scaling of $V_{\\mathrm{nl}}$ with the injector-detector separation $L$. The voltage is proportional to $\\exp(-L/\\lambda_{s})$. This indicates that the nonlocal spin signal decays exponentially with distance, with a characteristic decay length equal to the spin diffusion length $\\lambda_{s}$. Measuring $V_{\\mathrm{nl}}(L)$ as a function of $L$ is a standard method for determining $\\lambda_s$ in a material.",

            "solution": "The user-provided problem has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in semiconductor spintronics. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the effective spin diffusion length $\\lambda_s$ in a thin film with surface depolarization. The spin dynamics are governed by the spin continuity equation and Fick's law.\n\nFirst, we formulate the one-dimensional boundary-value problem. The spin continuity equation is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J}_s = -\\frac{s}{\\tau_b}\n$$\nAnd Fick's law for spin current is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{J}_s = -D \\nabla s\n$$\nwhere $s(x,t)$ is the spin density, $\\boldsymbol{J}_s$ is the spin current, $D$ is the spin diffusion constant, and $\\tau_b$ is the bulk spin relaxation time. Since the system has translational invariance in the $y-z$ plane, the spin density $s$ and spin current $\\boldsymbol{J}_s$ depend only on the coordinate $x$ and time $t$. Thus, $\\nabla s = \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial x}\\hat{x}$ and $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J}_s = \\frac{\\partial J_{sx}}{\\partial x}$. Combining the two governing equations yields the spin diffusion-relaxation equation in one dimension:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 s}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{s}{\\tau_b}\n$$\nThis equation is defined on the domain $x \\in [-t/2, t/2]$.\n\nThe boundary conditions are given by the surface spin recombination. The outward normal spin current equals $S$ times the local spin density.\nAt the surface $x = t/2$, the outward normal is in the $+x$ direction. The boundary condition is $J_{sx}(t/2, t) = S s(t/2, t)$. Using Fick's law, $J_{sx} = -D \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial x}$, this becomes:\n$$\n-D \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=t/2} = S s(t/2, t) \\implies D \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=t/2} + S s(t/2, t) = 0\n$$\nAt the surface $x = -t/2$, the outward normal is in the $-x$ direction. The boundary condition is $-J_{sx}(-t/2, t) = S s(-t/2, t)$. This becomes:\n$$\n-(-D \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=-t/2}) = S s(-t/2, t) \\implies D \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=-t/2} - S s(-t/2, t) = 0\n$$\n\nTo find the spin density modes, we use the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $s(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the diffusion equation gives:\n$$\nX(x)\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = D T(t)\\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{X(x)T(t)}{\\tau_b}\n$$\nDividing by $X(x)T(t)$ and rearranging terms, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_b} = \\frac{D}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} = -\\text{constant}\n$$\nLet the constant be $Dk^2$.

The spatial part becomes an ordinary differential equation for $X(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} + k^2 X(x) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$. Due to the symmetry of the domain and boundary conditions about $x=0$, the eigenfunctions can be separated into even (cosine) and odd (sine) solutions. The slowest decay mode corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue $k^2$, which is expected for the lowest-order even solution.\nLet's consider the even solution, $X(x) = A\\cos(kx)$. The derivative is $X'(x) = -Ak\\sin(kx)$. Applying the boundary conditions:\n- At $x = t/2$: $D(-Ak\\sin(kt/2)) + S(A\\cos(kt/2)) = 0 \\implies Dk\\sin(kt/2) = S\\cos(kt/2)$.\n- At $x = -t/2$: $D(-Ak\\sin(-kt/2)) - S(A\\cos(-kt/2)) = 0 \\implies Dk\\sin(kt/2) = S\\cos(kt/2)$.\nBoth boundaries give the same transcendental equation for the wavevector $k$ of the even modes:\n$$\nk\\tan\\left(\\frac{kt}{2}\\right) = \\frac{S}{D}\n$$\nThis equation determines the discrete set of allowed values for $k$. The slowest decay mode corresponds to the smallest positive root of this equation, which we denote as $k_1$. This is the condition determining the slowest transverse eigenmode.\n\nThe effective spin relaxation time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is defined as the decay time of this slowest mode. Thus:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_b} + Dk_1^2\n$$\n\nIn the thin-film limit, the problem states that the lowest transverse mode angle, $\\theta_1 = k_1t/2$, is small. For a small angle, we can use the approximation $\\tan(\\theta_1) \\approx \\theta_1$. The eigenvalue equation becomes:\n$$\nk_1\\left(\\frac{k_1t}{2}\\right) = \\frac{S}{D} \\implies k_1^2 = \\frac{2S}{Dt}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the effective relaxation rate:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_b} + D\\left(\\frac{2S}{Dt}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\tau_b} + \\frac{2S}{t}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the total relaxation rate is the sum of the bulk rate and a surface-induced rate $2S/t$. From this, we can find $\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_b} + \\frac{2S}{t}\\right)^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{t + 2S\\tau_b}{t\\tau_b}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{t\\tau_b}{t + 2S\\tau_b}\n$$\nThe effective in-plane spin diffusion length $\\lambda_s$ is defined as $\\lambda_s = \\sqrt{D \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$.

So, the derived analytic expression for $\\lambda_s$ is:\n$$\n\\lambda_s = \\frac{\\sqrt{D\\tau_b}}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2S\\tau_b}{t}}}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the bulk value $\\sqrt{D\\tau_b}$ is renormalized (reduced) by a factor that depends on the surface recombination velocity $S$ and the film thickness $t$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\lambda_s$ using the given parameters:\n$D = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$\n$\\tau_b = 5.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n$t = 3.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$S = 5.0 \\times 10^{1}\\ \\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the bulk diffusion length squared:\n$\\lambda_b^2 = D\\tau_b = (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-10}) = 2.5 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless term in the denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{2S\\tau_b}{t} = \\frac{2 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^1) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-10})}{3.0 \\times 10^{-8}} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{3.0 \\times 10^{-8}} = \\frac{5}{3}\n$$\nNow, we calculate $\\lambda_s^2$:\n$$\n\\lambda_s^2 = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-12}}{1 + \\frac{5}{3}} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-12}}{\\frac{8}{3}} = \\frac{3 \\times 2.5}{8} \\times 10^{-12} = \\frac{7.5}{8} \\times 10^{-12} = 0.9375 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}\n$$\nTaking the square root to find $\\lambda_s$:\n$$\n\\lambda_s = \\sqrt{0.9375 \\times 10^{-12}} \\approx 0.9682458 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in nanometers ($1\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$):\n$$\n\\lambda_s \\approx 968.2458\\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\lambda_s = 968.2\\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$",

Combining the two equations gives:\n$$\n\\dot{m}_x + i\\dot{m}_y = (\\gamma a_J m_x - \\gamma H' m_y - \\alpha \\dot{m}_y) + i(\\gamma H' m_x + \\gamma a_J m_y + \\alpha \\dot{m}_x)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{m}_+ = \\gamma a_J (m_x + i m_y) + i \\gamma H' (m_x + i m_y) + i \\alpha (\\dot{m}_x + i \\dot{m}_y)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{m}_+ = (\\gamma a_J + i \\gamma H') m_+ + i \\alpha \\dot{m}_+\n$$\nRearranging for $\\dot{m}_+$:\n$$\n\\dot{m}_+ (1 - i\\alpha) = \\gamma (a_J + i H') m_+\n$$\nThis gives a first-order ODE, $\\dot{m}_+ = \\lambda m_+$, where the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\gamma (a_J + i H')}{1 - i\\alpha} = \\frac{\\gamma (a_J + i H')(1 + i\\alpha)}{1 + \\alpha^2} = \\frac{\\gamma}{1+\\alpha^2} \\left[ (a_J - \\alpha H') + i(H' + \\alpha a_J) \\right]\n$$\nWe look for solutions of the form $m_+(t) \\propto e^{i\\omega t}$, which corresponds to precession with complex frequency $\\omega$. Differentiating gives $\\dot{m}_+ = i\\omega m_+$. Comparing this with $\\dot{m}_+ = \\lambda m_+$, we have $\\omega = -i\\lambda$.\n$$\n\\omega = -i \\frac{\\gamma}{1+\\alpha^2} \\left[ (a_J - \\alpha H') + i(H' + \\alpha a_J) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{\\gamma}{1+\\alpha^2} \\left[ (H' + \\alpha a_J) + i(\\alpha H' - a_J) \\right]\n$$\nThis complex frequency corresponds to one of the precessional eigenmodes. The other eigenmode has frequency $-\\omega^*$. For a physically meaningful resonance (positive frequency for $\\gamma > 0, H' > 0$), we identify the FMR angular frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}$ with the real part of $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}} = \\mathrm{Re}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\gamma}{1+\\alpha^2} (H' + \\alpha a_J)\n$$\nThe imaginary part of $\\omega$ gives the temporal decay (or growth) rate of the oscillations. The amplitude evolves as $e^{-\\mathrm{Im}(\\omega)t}$. The FWHM linewidth in the frequency domain, $\\Delta\\omega$, is twice this decay rate. For a stable system where oscillations are damped, we require $\\mathrm{Im}(\\omega) > 0$.\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega = 2 \\cdot \\mathrm{Im}(\\omega) = 2 \\frac{\\gamma}{1+\\alpha^2} (\\alpha H' - a_J)\n$$\nThe stability condition $\\mathrm{Im}(\\omega) > 0$ means the intrinsic damping proportional to $\\alpha H'$ must be larger than the anti-damping torque proportional to $a_J$.\n\nSubstituting $H' = H_0 + H_k + b_J$, the final expressions are:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{1+\\alpha^2} \\left( H_0 + H_k + b_J + \\alpha a_J \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega = \\frac{2\\gamma}{1+\\alpha^2} \\left( \\alpha(H_0 + H_k + b_J) - a_J \\right)\n$$",
