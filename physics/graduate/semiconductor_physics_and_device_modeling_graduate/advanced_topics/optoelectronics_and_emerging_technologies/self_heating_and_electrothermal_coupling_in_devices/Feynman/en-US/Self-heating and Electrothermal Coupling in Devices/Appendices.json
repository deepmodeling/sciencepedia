The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe fundamental principle governing heat transfer is the conservation of energy. For a steady-state system with heat conduction and an internal heat source, the energy balance dictates that the net rate of heat conducted out of a differential volume element must equal the rate of heat generated within that volume. This is expressed by the steady-state heat diffusion equation. In one dimension, this equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( k \\frac{dT}{dx} \\right) + q_{\\text{gen}} = 0\n$$\nwhere $T(x)$ is the temperature field, $k$ is the thermal conductivity, and $q_{\\text{gen}}$ is the volumetric heat generation rate. The term $k \\frac{dT}{dx}$ is the heat flux, based on Fourier's law of heat conduction ($J_Q = -k \\nabla T$).\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the thermal conductivity $k$ is constant, and the volumetric heat generation density $q$ is uniform. Therefore, $q_{\\text{gen}} = q$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nk \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} + q = 0\n$$\nRearranging this gives a second-order ordinary differential equation for the temperature $T(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = -\\frac{q}{k}\n$$\nWe can solve this equation by integrating twice with respect to $x$. The first integration yields the temperature gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dx} = \\int \\left(-\\frac{q}{k}\\right) dx = -\\frac{q}{k}x + C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first integration constant.\nA second integration yields the temperature distribution $T(x)$:\n$$\nT(x) = \\int \\left(-\\frac{q}{k}x + C_1\\right) dx = -\\frac{q}{2k}x^2 + C_1x + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second integration constant.\n\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by applying the given boundary conditions:\n1.  At $x=0$, the temperature is $T_0$:\n    $T(0) = T_0 = -\\frac{q}{2k}(0)^2 + C_1(0) + C_2 \\implies C_2 = T_0$.\n2.  At $x=d$, the temperature is also $T_0$:\n    $T(d) = T_0 = -\\frac{q}{2k}d^2 + C_1d + T_0$.\n\nFrom the second condition, we can solve for $C_1$:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{q}{2k}d^2 + C_1d\n$$\n$$\nC_1d = \\frac{qd^2}{2k} \\implies C_1 = \\frac{qd}{2k}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution for $T(x)$, we obtain the steady-state temperature distribution:\n$$\nT(x) = -\\frac{q}{2k}x^2 + \\left(\\frac{qd}{2k}\\right)x + T_0\n$$\nThis expression can be factored to give a more intuitive form:\n$$\nT(x) = T_0 + \\frac{q}{2k}(dx - x^2) = T_0 + \\frac{qx(d-x)}{2k}\n$$\nThis equation describes a parabolic temperature profile, symmetric about the center of the slab.\n\nThe next step is to find the maximum temperature, $T_{max}$. The maximum temperature will occur at the position $x_{max}$ where the temperature gradient is zero, i.e., $\\frac{dT}{dx} = 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{q}{k}x + C_1 = -\\frac{q}{k}x + \\frac{qd}{2k}\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$\n-\\frac{q}{k}x_{max} + \\frac{qd}{2k} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{q}{k}x_{max} = \\frac{qd}{2k} \\implies x_{max} = \\frac{d}{2}\n$$\nAs expected from the symmetry of the problem, the maximum temperature occurs at the midpoint of the slab.\n\nTo find the value of the maximum temperature, we substitute $x = d/2$ into the expression for $T(x)$:\n$$\nT_{max} = T\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right) = T_0 + \\frac{q}{2k}\\left(d\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2\\right)\n$$\n$$\nT_{max} = T_0 + \\frac{q}{2k}\\left(\\frac{d^2}{2} - \\frac{d^2}{4}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nT_{max} = T_0 + \\frac{q}{2k}\\left(\\frac{d^2}{4}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nT_{max} = T_0 + \\frac{qd^2}{8k}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the maximum temperature rise above the boundary temperature $T_0$. This quantity, $\\Delta T_{max}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{max} = T_{max} - T_0\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{max} = \\left(T_0 + \\frac{qd^2}{8k}\\right) - T_0 = \\frac{qd^2}{8k}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the maximum temperature rise in terms of the given parameters $q$, $d$, and $k$.",

It is a standard problem in device physics and engineering that can be solved using first principles and linearization techniques. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe thermal behavior of the device is governed by the principle of energy conservation. The rate of change of thermal energy stored in the device is equal to the net power flow into it. The thermal energy stored is a function of the device's thermal capacitance $C_{\\theta}$ and its temperature $T$. The rate of change of this energy is $C_{\\theta} \\frac{dT}{dt}$. The power flowing into the device is the electrically generated power, $P_{gen}(T)$, and the power flowing out is the heat dissipated to the ambient, $P_{diss}(T)$.\n\nThe energy balance equation is therefore:\n$$C_{\\theta} \\frac{dT}{dt} = P_{gen}(T) - P_{diss}(T)$$\n\nThe generated power is given by the electrical power dissipation under constant voltage bias $V$:\n$$P_{gen}(T) = \\frac{V^{2}}{R(T)} = \\frac{V^{2}}{R_{0}\\left[1 + \\alpha\\left(T - T_{0}\\right)\\right]}$$\n\nThe dissipated power is governed by Newton's law of cooling through the thermal resistance $R_{\\theta}$:\n$$P_{diss}(T) = \\frac{T - T_{\\mathrm{a}}}{R_{\\theta}}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the energy balance equation gives the full dynamic equation for the device temperature:\n$$C_{\\theta} \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{V^{2}}{R_{0}\\left[1 + \\alpha\\left(T - T_{0}\\right)\\right]} - \\frac{T - T_{\\mathrm{a}}}{R_{\\theta}}$$\n\nThermal stability is analyzed by examining the system's response to a small perturbation around an equilibrium temperature, $T_{eq}$. At equilibrium, the temperature is constant ($\\frac{dT}{dt} = 0$), so the generated power equals the dissipated power: $P_{gen}(T_{eq}) = P_{diss}(T_{eq})$.\n\nTo analyze local stability, we consider a small temperature perturbation $\\delta T(t)$ around an equilibrium point $T_{eq}$, such that $T(t) = T_{eq} + \\delta T(t)$. We linearize the dynamic equation around $T_{eq}$:\n$$C_{\\theta} \\frac{d(T_{eq} + \\delta T)}{dt} = P_{gen}(T_{eq} + \\delta T) - P_{diss}(T_{eq} + \\delta T)$$\n$$C_{\\theta} \\frac{d(\\delta T)}{dt} \\approx \\left[ P_{gen}(T_{eq}) + \\left. \\frac{dP_{gen}}{dT} \\right|_{T=T_{eq}} \\delta T \\right] - \\left[ P_{diss}(T_{eq}) + \\left. \\frac{dP_{diss}}{dT} \\right|_{T=T_{eq}} \\delta T \\right]$$\n\nSince $P_{gen}(T_{eq}) = P_{diss}(T_{eq})$, these terms cancel, yielding the linearized equation for the perturbation:\n$$C_{\\theta} \\frac{d(\\delta T)}{dt} = \\left( \\left. \\frac{dP_{gen}}{dT} \\right|_{T=T_{eq}} - \\left. \\frac{dP_{diss}}{dT} \\right|_{T=T_{eq}} \\right) \\delta T$$\n\nFor the system to be stable, the perturbation $\\delta T$ must decay to zero over time. This requires the coefficient of $\\delta T$ on the right-hand side to be negative. Thus, the condition for local stability is:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dP_{gen}}{dT} \\right|_{T=T_{eq}} - \\left. \\frac{dP_{diss}}{dT} \\right|_{T=T_{eq}} < 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\left. \\frac{dP_{gen}}{dT} \\right|_{T=T_{eq}} < \\left. \\frac{dP_{diss}}{dT} \\right|_{T=T_{eq}}$$\nThis condition means that for stability, any increase in temperature must cause the heat dissipation to increase more than the heat generation.\n\nThe problem requires us to evaluate this condition at the reference temperature $T_{0}$. First, we calculate the derivative of the generated power:\n$$\\frac{dP_{gen}}{dT} = \\frac{d}{dT} \\left( \\frac{V^{2}}{R_{0}\\left[1 + \\alpha\\left(T - T_{0}\\right)\\right]} \\right) = - \\frac{V^{2} (R_{0}\\alpha)}{\\left(R_{0}\\left[1 + \\alpha\\left(T - T_{0}\\right)\\right]\\right)^{2}} = - \\frac{V^{2}\\alpha}{R_{0}\\left[1 + \\alpha\\left(T - T_{0}\\right)\\right]^{2}}$$\nEvaluating this at $T=T_{0}$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dP_{gen}}{dT} \\right|_{T=T_{0}} = - \\frac{V^{2}\\alpha}{R_{0}\\left[1 + \\alpha\\left(T_{0} - T_{0}\\right)\\right]^{2}} = - \\frac{\\alpha V^{2}}{R_{0}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the derivative of the dissipated power:\n$$\\frac{dP_{diss}}{dT} = \\frac{d}{dT} \\left( \\frac{T - T_{\\mathrm{a}}}{R_{\\theta}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{R_{\\theta}}$$\nThis derivative is constant.\n\nSubstituting these derivatives into the stability condition:\n$$- \\frac{\\alpha V^{2}}{R_{0}} < \\frac{1}{R_{\\theta}}$$\n\nThermal runaway is a positive feedback phenomenon where an increase in temperature leads to an even greater increase in power generation, causing catastrophic heating. This occurs when $\\frac{dP_{gen}}{dT} > 0$, which requires the temperature coefficient of resistance $\\alpha$ to be negative. For a physically meaningful, positive critical thermal resistance $R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{crit}}$, we must have $\\alpha < 0$.\n\nThe critical condition for the onset of thermal runaway is the boundary of instability, where the inequality becomes an equality:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dP_{gen}}{dT} \\right|_{T=T_{0}} = \\left. \\frac{dP_{diss}}{dT} \\right|_{T=T_{0}}$$\n$$- \\frac{\\alpha V^{2}}{R_{0}} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{crit}}}$$\n\nSolving for the critical thermal resistance, $R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{crit}} = - \\frac{R_{0}}{\\alpha V^{2}}$$\n\nIf the actual thermal resistance $R_{\\theta}$ is greater than this critical value, $R_{\\theta} > R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{crit}}$, then $\\frac{1}{R_{\\theta}} < \\frac{1}{R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{crit}}}$. This implies $\\frac{1}{R_{\\theta}} < -\\frac{\\alpha V^2}{R_0}$, which violates the stability criterion. Therefore, $R_{\\theta,\\mathrm{crit}}$ is indeed the threshold above which thermal runaway occurs.",

Given $\\tau_{\\mathrm{el}} = 25\\ \\mathrm{ns}$, settling to within $\\sim 1\\%$ requires $t_s  5\\tau_{\\mathrm{el}} = 125\\ \\mathrm{ns}$.\n2.  **Thermal rise is negligible:** $t_s \\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Given $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}} = 10\\ \\mathrm{ms}$, this condition is easily met for $t_s$ in the nanosecond or microsecond range. The temperature rise during a pulse of duration $t$ for $t \\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is approximately linear: $\\Delta T(t) \\approx \\frac{P \\cdot t}{C_{\\mathrm{th}}}$.\n3.  **Baseline temperature is stable at $T_0$**: The average temperature rise due to repeated pulses, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{avg}} = P_{\\mathrm{avg}} R_{\\mathrm{th}} = P \\cdot (t_p/T_{\\mathrm{rep}}) \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{th}}$, must be negligible. This requires a small duty cycle, $D = t_p / T_{\\mathrm{rep}} \\ll 1$.\n\nThe second objective is to quantify the thermal effects, which requires measuring the temperature rise $\\Delta T$ as a function of time. The provided integrated platinum thermometer is the ideal tool for this, allowing for direct, in situ temperature measurement.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these principles.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use rectangular drain voltage pulses of width $t_p = 1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$ and repetition period $T_{\\mathrm{rep}} = 1\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ (duty cycle $D = 10^{-3}$). Sweep $V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ while holding $V_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ fixed for each pulse train. Sample $I_{\\mathrm{D}}$ at $t_s = 100\\ \\mathrm{ns}$ after the rising edge using a fast sample-and-hold to ensure electrical settling ($t_s \\gg \\tau_{\\mathrm{el}}$) but $t_s \\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Quantify residual heating by concurrently reading the platinum thermometer resistance $R_{\\mathrm{Pt}}(t)$ during pulses and converting $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{Pt}}$ to $\\Delta T$ via $\\alpha$, then vary $t_p$ across $0.5\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$ to $10\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$ at fixed $P$ to fit a first-order thermal response and extract $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{th}}$.**\n\n1.  **Objective (i) - Isothermal Measurement:**\n    -   **Sampling time:** $t_s = 100\\ \\mathrm{ns}$. This is $4\\tau_{\\mathrm{el}}$, which allows the electrical signal to settle to $e^{-4} \\approx 1.8\\%$ of its final value. This is a reasonable \"settled\" condition.\n    -   **Thermal rise at sampling:** $\\Delta T(t_s) \\approx \\frac{P t_s}{C_{\\mathrm{th}}} = \\frac{(2\\ \\mathrm{W})(100 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s})}{0.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}} = 0.001\\ \\mathrm{K}$. This temperature rise is utterly negligible. The measurement is effectively isothermal.\n    -   **Baseline heating:** The duty cycle is $D = \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}}{1\\ \\mathrm{ms}} = 10^{-3}$. The average temperature rise is $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{avg}} = P D R_{\\mathrm{th}} = (2\\ \\mathrm{W})(10^{-3})(50\\ \\mathrm{K/W}) = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{K}$. This is also negligible.\n    -   This protocol successfully achieves the goal of a quasi-isothermal measurement at $T_0$.\n\n2.  **Objective (ii) - Thermal Quantification:**\n    -   The proposal to use the integrated platinum thermometer is the correct approach, as it allows for direct and localized temperature measurement.\n    -   The technique of varying the pulse width $t_p$ and measuring the temperature rise at the end of the pulse, $\\Delta T(t_p)$, is the standard method for a thermal transient measurement. This allows for the characterization of the device's thermal impedance as a function of time, from which $R_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{th}}$ (and thus $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$) can be extracted.\n\n**Verdict:** This option describes a comprehensive and physically sound protocol that meets both experimental objectives using the appropriate principles and tools. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Perform a Direct Current (DC) $I$–$V$ sweep with $100\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ dwell per bias point to ensure the device reaches a steady-state temperature, then correct the measured $I$–$V$ to the intrinsic curve by subtracting $\\Delta T = R_{\\mathrm{th}} P$ using the known $R_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Quantify residual heating by reading the platinum thermometer only once per sweep at the end of each dwell.**\n\n1.  **Objective (i) - Isothermal Measurement:**\n    -   The dwell time is $100\\ \\mathrm{ms}$, which is $10\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The device will reach its thermal steady state at each bias point. The temperature rise will be $\\Delta T_{ss} = P R_{\\mathrm{th}} = (2\\ \\mathrm{W})(50\\ \\mathrm{K/W}) = 100\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n    -   This protocol *maximizes* self-heating, directly contradicting the goal of *minimizing* it to measure the intrinsic characteristics at $T_0$. The proposed \"correction\" is unreliable as the current's dependence on temperature is complex and non-linear, making accurate reconstruction of the isothermal curve from a high-temperature measurement very difficult.\n    -   This protocol fundamentally fails to meet the primary objective.\n\n**Verdict:** This option is the opposite of the required technique. It measures a thermally saturated characteristic, not the intrinsic one. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Use rectangular drain pulses of width $t_p = 10\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$ with repetition period $T_{\\mathrm{rep}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$ (duty cycle $D = 0.1$). Sample $I_{\\mathrm{D}}$ at the end of the pulse ($t_s = t_p$) to capture the quasi-steady current under heating. Quantify temperature rise with an external infrared camera, assuming it resolves $\\mathrm{\\mu s}$ transients and sub-micrometer hotspots, and apply this temperature to correct the $I$–$V$.**\n\n1.  **Objective (i) - Isothermal Measurement:**\n    -   **Baseline heating:** The duty cycle is very high, $D = \\frac{10\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}}{100\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}} = 0.1$. The average temperature rise is $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{avg}} = P D R_{\\mathrm{th}} = (2\\ \\mathrm{W})(0.1)(50\\ \\mathrm{K/W}) = 10\\ \\mathrm{K}$. This is a significant baseline temperature increase, meaning the measurement is not performed at $T_0$.\n    -   The sampling occurs at $t_s=10\\ \\mu s$, which introduces additional transient heating. This protocol does not provide an isothermal measurement at $T_0$.\n\n2.  **Objective (ii) - Thermal Quantification:**\n    -   The proposal to use an external IR camera makes a scientifically implausible assumption. Standard IR cameras cannot resolve microsecond-scale transients. Achieving such temporal resolution requires highly specialized, fast-scanning or single-point detector systems. Furthermore, achieving \"sub-micrometer\" spatial resolution is physically impossible with mid-infrared light due to the diffraction limit ($\\lambda \\approx 3-5\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$). This method is not feasible as described, especially when a more suitable in situ thermometer is available.\n\n**Verdict:** This option fails due to a high duty cycle causing significant baseline heating and relies on a physically unrealistic measurement technique. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Apply triangular drain pulses ramping from $0$ to $V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ over $t_p = 1\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ and back to $0$ over $1\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ with repetition period $T_{\\mathrm{rep}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ (duty cycle $D = 0.02$). Sample $I_{\\mathrm{D}}$ at the midpoint of each ramp to avoid edge transients. Quantify residual heating indirectly by fitting the time evolution of transconductance $g_m(t)$ to an assumed mobility temperature law without independent temperature measurement.**\n\n1.  **Objective (i) - Isothermal Measurement:**\n    -   The ramp time is $1\\ \\mathrm{ms}$. This is a significant fraction of the thermal time constant ($t_{ramp} = 0.1 \\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$). Significant self-heating will occur *during* the ramp. Sampling at the midpoint ($t=0.5\\ \\mathrm{ms}$) does not yield an isothermal measurement. The device temperature will have risen considerably by this time.\n\n2.  **Objective (ii) - Thermal Quantification:**\n    -   This option proposes an indirect, model-dependent method for temperature extraction (\"fitting... to an assumed mobility temperature law\"). This is a weak approach because it relies on assumptions about the very physical behavior it seeks to study. It completely ignores the direct, calibrated, and much more reliable platinum thermometer that is explicitly provided in the problem setup. This is poor experimental design.\n\n**Verdict:** This option fails to provide an isothermal measurement due to the long pulse duration and employs a suboptimal, indirect method for temperature quantification. **Incorrect**.",
