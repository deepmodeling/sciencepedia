Derivation and Calculation of Built-in Potential ($V_{bi}$)**\n\nAt thermal equilibrium, the Fermi level ($E_F$) is constant throughout the semiconductor. The built-in potential, $V_{bi}$, arises from the difference in the electrostatic potential between the neutral $p$-region and the neutral $n$-region, which is necessary to align the Fermi levels. It can be expressed as the difference in the Fermi levels of the isolated neutral regions divided by the elementary charge $q$.\n\nUsing non-degenerate Boltzmann statistics, the electron and hole concentrations in the neutral $n$-type and $p$-type regions are related to the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$ and the intrinsic Fermi level $E_i$.\n\nIn the neutral $n$-region, the electron concentration is $n_n \\approx N_D$. This is given by:\n$$n_n = N_D = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F} - E_{i,n}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $E_{i,n}$ is the intrinsic level in the $n$-region.\n\nIn the neutral $p$-region, the hole concentration is $p_p \\approx N_A$. This is given by:\n$$p_p = N_A = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{i,p} - E_{F}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $E_{i,p}$ is the intrinsic level in the $p$-region.\n\nThe built-in potential is related to the difference in intrinsic energy levels: $qV_{bi} = E_{i,p} - E_{i,n}$.\nFrom the equations above, we can write:\n$$E_F - E_{i,n} = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_D}{n_i}\\right)$$\n$$E_{i,p} - E_F = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right)$$\nAdding these two equations gives:\n$$E_{i,p} - E_{i,n} = k_B T \\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_D}{n_i}\\right)\\right) = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}\\right)$$\nSince $qV_{bi} = E_{i,p} - E_{i,n}$, we arrive at the expression for the built-in potential:\n$$V_{bi} = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}\\right)$$\nThe term $V_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q}$ is the thermal voltage.\n\nUsing the given values:\n$k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$\n$T = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$\n$N_A = 1 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$N_D = 5 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$n_i = 1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n\nFirst, calculate the thermal voltage $V_T$:\n$$V_T = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (300\\ \\mathrm{K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nNow, calculate $V_{bi}$:\n$$V_{bi} = (0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1 \\times 10^{17}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{13})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{10})^2}\\right) = (0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{5 \\times 10^{30}}{1 \\times 10^{20}}\\right)$$\n$$V_{bi} = (0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\ln(5 \\times 10^{10}) \\approx (0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\times (24.635) \\approx 0.6368\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the built-in potential is $V_{bi} = 0.637\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n\n**2. Derivation and Calculation of Depletion Widths ($x_p, x_n$)**\n\nWe start from the one-dimensional Poisson's equation:\n$$\\frac{d^2 V}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0}$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of silicon. Within the depletion approximation, the space-charge density $\\rho(x)$ is assumed to be composed only of ionized dopants in the depletion region (from $-x_p$ to $x_n$):\n$$\\rho(x) = \\begin{cases} -q N_A & \\text{for } -x_p < x < 0 \\\\ +q N_D & \\text{for } 0 < x < x_n \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nThe total space-charge region must be neutral, which implies that the total negative charge on the $p$-side equals the total positive charge on the $n$-side:\n$$q N_A x_p A = q N_D x_n A$$\nwhere $A$ is the junction area. This simplifies to the charge balance equation:\n$$N_A x_p = N_D x_n$$\nThis relation shows that the depletion width extends further into the more lightly doped region.\n\nIntegrating Poisson's equation once gives the electric field $E(x) = -\\frac{dV}{dx}$. Integrating from the edge of the depletion region, where the field is zero, we get:\nFor $-x_p < x < 0$: $E(x) = \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0}(x+x_p)$\nFor $0 < x < x_n$: $E(x) = -\\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0}(x-x_n)$\n\nThe potential difference across the junction is the built-in potential $V_{bi}$. This is obtained by integrating the electric field across the entire depletion region:\n$$V_{bi} = -\\int_{-x_p}^{x_n} E(x) dx = -\\left[ \\int_{-x_p}^{0} \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0}(x+x_p) dx + \\int_{0}^{x_n} -\\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0}(x-x_n) dx \\right]$$\n$$V_{bi} = \\frac{q}{\\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{N_A x_p^2}{2} + \\frac{N_D x_n^2}{2} \\right]$$\nWe now have a system of two equations for the two unknowns $x_p$ and $x_n$:\n1) $x_p = \\frac{N_D}{N_A} x_n$\n2) $V_{bi} = \\frac{q}{2 \\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0} (N_A x_p^2 + N_D x_n^2)$\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n$$V_{bi} = \\frac{q}{2 \\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0} \\left( N_A \\left(\\frac{N_D}{N_A}x_n\\right)^2 + N_D x_n^2 \\right) = \\frac{q}{2 \\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{N_D^2}{N_A}x_n^2 + N_D x_n^2 \\right)$$\n$$V_{bi} = \\frac{q N_D x_n^2}{2 \\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{N_D}{N_A} + 1 \\right) = \\frac{q N_D x_n^2}{2 \\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{N_A + N_D}{N_A}$$\nSolving for $x_n$:\n$$x_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0 V_{bi}}{q} \\frac{N_A}{N_D(N_A + N_D)}}$$\nSimilarly, solving for $x_p$:\n$$x_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0 V_{bi}}{q} \\frac{N_D}{N_A(N_A + N_D)}}$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical values.\nThe permittivity of silicon is $\\varepsilon_{Si} = \\varepsilon_s \\varepsilon_0 = 11.7 \\times (8.854187 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm}) \\approx 1.0359 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm}$.\nSince $N_A = 1 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\gg N_D = 5 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, we can approximate $N_A + N_D \\approx N_A$.\nThe formulas simplify to:\n$$x_n \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{Si} V_{bi}}{q N_D}}$$\n$$x_p \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{Si} V_{bi}}{q} \\frac{N_D}{N_A^2}} = x_n \\frac{N_D}{N_A}$$\nLet's use the exact formulas for precision.\n$$x_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (1.0359 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm})(0.6368\\ \\mathrm{V})}{1.6022 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}} \\frac{1 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}{(5 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3})(1 \\times 10^{17} + 5 \\times 10^{13})\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}}$$\n$$x_n \\approx \\sqrt{(8.235 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\frac{1 \\times 10^{17}}{5 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\times\\ 1.0005 \\times 10^{17}}} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\approx \\sqrt{1.646 \\times 10^{-7}}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$$\n$$x_n \\approx 4.057 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm} = 4.057\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $x_n = 4.06\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$.\n\nFor $x_p$, we can use the charge balance equation:\n$$x_p = x_n \\frac{N_D}{N_A} = (4.057\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}) \\frac{5 \\times 10^{13}}{1 \\times 10^{17}} = (4.057\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-4})$$\n$$x_p \\approx 0.0020285\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $x_p = 0.00203\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$. The depletion region extends almost entirely into the lightly doped $n^-$ drift region, as expected.\n\n**3. Qualitative Explanation of Gate-Induced Inversion Effects**\n\nThe question addresses the impact of a MOS gate on the $p$-base electrostatics, specifically the role of gate-induced inversion.\n\n*   **Effect on Built-in Potential ($V_{bi}$):** The built-in potential is a fundamental property of the metallurgical $p$-$n$ junction determined by the material's doping profile ($N_A, N_D$) and temperature ($T$) under conditions of thermal equilibrium. Thermal equilibrium implies that all externally applied potentials are zero. The mere presence of a gate structure does not alter these doping profiles or the temperature. Therefore, under equilibrium conditions (zero gate bias), the built-in potential $V_{bi}$ of the vertical junction remains unchanged from the value calculated above. An applied gate voltage takes the system out of equilibrium, but it does not change the definition or the value of the equilibrium built-in potential itself.\n\n*   **Effect on Space-Charge Distribution and Depletion Widths:** Gate-induced inversion occurs when a sufficiently large positive voltage is applied to the gate, attracting minority carriers (electrons) to the surface of the $p$-base and forming an inversion channel. This phenomenon fundamentally alters the electrostatics near the surface:\n    1.  **Modified Space-Charge:** The space-charge distribution is modified primarily at the silicon-insulator interface. A new layer of mobile negative charge, the electron inversion layer ($Q_{inv}$), is created. This charge exists in addition to the fixed negative space charge of the ionized acceptors ($-qN_A$) in the depletion region of the $p$-base.\n    2.  **Modified Depletion Width Partitioning:** The concepts of simple, one-dimensional depletion widths $x_p$ and $x_n$ are strictly valid only for a planar junction far from any surface effects. The presence of the gate and its associated electric field makes the problem two-dimensional near the surface. The inversion channel, being rich in electrons, acts as an electrical extension of the $n^-$ drift region along the surface of the $p$-base. The depletion region of the vertical junction merges with the depletion region formed horizontally under the gate (the MOS capacitor's depletion region). The equipotential lines, which are planar in the 1D model, become curved in this 2D region. The simple partitioning rule $N_A x_p = N_D x_n$ remains a valid approximation for the bulk part of the junction, far from the influence of the gate, but it does not accurately describe the complex charge and field distribution at the corner where the gate, $p$-base, and $n^-$ region meet. The gate's primary role is to control the conductivity of the surface channel, thereby enabling or disabling current flow, rather than fundamentally re-partitioning the width of the vertical junction's equilibrium depletion region in the bulk.",

In the quasi-neutral $n^-$ region, we can use non-degenerate Boltzmann statistics and the quasi-Fermi levels to relate the nonequilibrium carrier concentrations.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Non-degenerate Boltzmann relations for carrier concentrations in terms of quasi-Fermi levels:\n$$n = N_C \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_{F_n}}{k_B T}\\right), \\quad p = N_V \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{F_p} - E_V}{k_B T}\\right).$$\n- The intrinsic carrier concentration satisfies $n_i^2 = N_C N_V \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$, so combining the above gives the generalized mass-action relation under nonequilibrium:\n$$n p = n_i^2 \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{E_{F_n} - E_{F_p}}{k_B T}\\right).$$\n- In steady forward bias across a $p$-$n$ junction, the separation of quasi-Fermi levels across the depletion region equals the applied junction voltage:\n$$E_{F_n} - E_{F_p} = q V_J.$$\nThus, in the $n^-$ side at the edge of the depletion region (and, under low-field ambipolar transport, approximately throughout the quasi-neutral region), the product of carrier concentrations satisfies\n$$n p = n_i^2 \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{q V_J}{k_B T}\\right).$$\n\nNext, in the $n$-type drift region with fully ionized donors and negligible acceptors, charge neutrality in the quasi-neutral bulk gives\n$$\\rho \\approx q\\left(p - n + N_D\\right) \\approx 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n - p = N_D.$$\nWe now have a coupled system for $n$ and $p$:\n$$n p = n_i^2 \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{q V_J}{k_B T}\\right), \\qquad n - p = N_D.$$\nSolving, write $n = p + N_D$ and substitute into the product:\n$$(p + N_D)\\,p = n_i^2 \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{q V_J}{k_B T}\\right).$$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $p$,\n$$p^2 + N_D p - C = 0, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad C \\equiv n_i^2 \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{q V_J}{k_B T}\\right).$$\nThe physically meaningful root is\n$$p = \\frac{-N_D + \\sqrt{N_D^2 + 4 C}}{2}, \\qquad n = p + N_D = \\frac{N_D + \\sqrt{N_D^2 + 4 C}}{2}.$$\n\nHigh-level injection limit:\nWhen the injected carrier product $C$ dominates the doping, i.e., $C \\gg N_D^2$, the square root simplifies as $\\sqrt{N_D^2 + 4 C} \\approx 2\\sqrt{C}$, giving\n$$p \\approx \\sqrt{C}, \\qquad n \\approx \\sqrt{C} + N_D.$$\nMoreover, in the strict high-injection regime $\\sqrt{C} \\gg N_D$, so $n \\approx p \\approx \\sqrt{C}$. Using the definition of $C$,\n$$n \\approx p \\approx n_i \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{q V_J}{2 k_B T}\\right).$$\n\nConductivity modulation:\nThe injected conductivity is\n$$\\sigma = q\\left(\\mu_n n + \\mu_p p\\right),$$\nand the initial drift-region conductivity (without injection) is\n$$\\sigma_0 = q\\,\\mu_n N_D.$$\nHence the modulation factor is\n$$M \\equiv \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma_0} = \\frac{\\mu_n n + \\mu_p p}{\\mu_n N_D}.$$\nUnder high-level injection with $n \\approx p \\approx n_i \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{q V_J}{2 k_B T}\\right)$,\n$$M \\approx \\frac{(\\mu_n + \\mu_p)\\,n_i \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{q V_J}{2 k_B T}\\right)}{\\mu_n N_D} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_n}\\right)\\,\\frac{n_i}{N_D}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{q V_J}{2 k_B T}\\right).$$\n\nNumerical evaluation:\nUse $T = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $V_J = 0.7\\ \\mathrm{V}$, $n_i = 1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, $N_D = 1.0 \\times 10^{14}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, $\\mu_n = 1400\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})$, $\\mu_p = 450\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})$, and $V_T \\equiv \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\approx 0.025852\\ \\mathrm{V}$ at $300\\ \\mathrm{K}$.
