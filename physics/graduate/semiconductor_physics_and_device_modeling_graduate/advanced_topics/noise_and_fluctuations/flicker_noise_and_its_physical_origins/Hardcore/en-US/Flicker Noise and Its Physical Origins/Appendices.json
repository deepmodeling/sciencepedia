The derivation of the power spectral density will now proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds in two main steps. First, we determine the autocorrelation function of the drain current fluctuation, $R_{\\delta I}(\\Delta t)$. Second, we apply the Wiener-Khinchin theorem to find its one-sided power spectral density, $S_I(f)$.\n\nThe drain current fluctuation $\\delta I(t)$ is related to the two-state process $s(t)$ by:\n$$\n\\delta I(t) = \\Delta I\\, s(t)\n$$\nThe autocorrelation function of the current fluctuation, $R_{\\delta I}(\\Delta t)$, is defined as the expected value of the product of the signal at time $t$ and time $t+\\Delta t$. For a stationary process, this is independent of $t$.\n$$\nR_{\\delta I}(\\Delta t) = \\langle \\delta I(t)\\,\\delta I(t+\\Delta t) \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\delta I(t)$:\n$$\nR_{\\delta I}(\\Delta t) = \\langle (\\Delta I\\, s(t))(\\Delta I\\, s(t+\\Delta t)) \\rangle\n$$\nSince $\\Delta I$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\nR_{\\delta I}(\\Delta t) = (\\Delta I)^2 \\langle s(t)s(t+\\Delta t) \\rangle\n$$\nThe problem provides the autocorrelation function for the state variable $s(t)$:\n$$\n\\langle s(t)s(t+\\Delta t) \\rangle = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|\\Delta t|}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $R_{\\delta I}(\\Delta t)$, we obtain the autocorrelation of the current fluctuation:\n$$\nR_{\\delta I}(\\Delta t) = (\\Delta I)^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|\\Delta t|}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nNext, we use the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, which states that the power spectral density of a stationary random process is the Fourier transform of its autocorrelation function. The problem asks for the one-sided PSD, $S_I(f)$, which is defined for non-negative frequencies $f \\ge 0$. For a real-valued process, the one-sided PSD is related to the two-sided PSD by $S_I(f) = 2 S_{I, \\text{two-sided}}(f)$. The two-sided PSD is the direct Fourier transform:\n$$\nS_{I, \\text{two-sided}}(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} R_{\\delta I}(t') \\exp(-i 2\\pi f t') dt'\n$$\nwhere $t'$ is the time lag variable (denoted as $\\Delta t$ in the problem statement).\nTherefore, the one-sided PSD is:\n$$\nS_I(f) = 2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} R_{\\delta I}(t') \\exp(-i 2\\pi f t') dt'\n$$\nSince the autocorrelation function $R_{\\delta I}(t')$ is a real and even function of $t'$, its Fourier transform is real and even. The expression for $S_I(f)$ can be simplified using Euler's formula, $\\exp(-ix) = \\cos(x) - i\\sin(x)$, and the fact that the integral of an odd function (like $\\sin$) over a symmetric interval is zero:\n$$\nS_I(f) = 2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} R_{\\delta I}(t') \\cos(2\\pi f t') dt'\n$$\nUsing the even property of the integrand once more, we can write this as:\n$$\nS_I(f) = 4 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} R_{\\delta I}(t') \\cos(2\\pi f t') dt'\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{\\delta I}(t')$:\n$$\nS_I(f) = 4 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (\\Delta I)^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t'}{\\tau}\\right) \\cos(2\\pi f t') dt'\n$$\n$$\nS_I(f) = 4 (\\Delta I)^2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t'}{\\tau}\\right) \\cos(2\\pi f t') dt'\n$$\nThis is a standard integral form, which can be evaluated using integration by parts or by recognizing it as the real part of the Laplace transform of $\\exp(i 2 \\pi f t')$. A standard integral identity is:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-at')\\cos(bt') dt' = \\frac{a}{a^2 + b^2}\n$$\nIn our case, the parameters are $a = 1/\\tau$ and $b = 2\\pi f$. Substituting these into the identity:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t'}{\\tau}\\right) \\cos(2\\pi f t') dt' = \\frac{1/\\tau}{(1/\\tau)^2 + (2\\pi f)^2}\n$$\nTo simplify this fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\\tau^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{1/\\tau}{(1/\\tau)^2 + (2\\pi f)^2} = \\frac{(1/\\tau)\\tau^2}{((1/\\tau)^2 + (2\\pi f)^2)\\tau^2} = \\frac{\\tau}{1 + (2\\pi f)^2 \\tau^2} = \\frac{\\tau}{1 + (2\\pi f\\tau)^2}\n$$\nNow, substitute this result back into the expression for $S_I(f)$:\n$$\nS_I(f) = 4 (\\Delta I)^2 \\left( \\frac{\\tau}{1 + (2\\pi f\\tau)^2} \\right)\n$$\nThis gives the final expression for the one-sided power spectral density of the current fluctuation, known as a Lorentzian spectrum.\n$$\nS_I(f) = \\frac{4 (\\Delta I)^2 \\tau}{1 + (2\\pi f \\tau)^2}\n$$\nThe expression is in terms of the specified parameters $\\Delta I$, $f$, and $\\tau$.",

The concepts of thermionic emission, shot noise from Poisson processes (Schottky's theorem), and flicker noise ($1/f$ noise) arising from carrier trapping/detrapping at interfaces (leading to barrier height or number fluctuations, as in the McWhorter model) are canonical topics in solid-state electronics.

It represents a standard, formalizable problem in electronic noise analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from the field of semiconductor device physics. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution will be developed by completing the four tasks outlined in the problem statement. We will use the standard definition of the single-sided power spectral density for current fluctuations, denoted $S_{I}(f)$, which has units of $\\mathrm{A}^{2}/\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\n**1. Shot Noise Power Spectral Density**\n\nShot noise arises from the discrete and random nature of charge carriers crossing the Schottky barrier. The problem states this can be modeled as a Poisson point process. For a current consisting of a series of independent, random events, where each event carries charge $q$, the resulting current fluctuation has a white (frequency-independent) power spectral density.\n\nAccording to Schottky's theorem, the single-sided PSD of current fluctuations due to a Poisson process with an average rate $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$$S_{I}^{\\mathrm{shot}}(f) = 2 q I$$\nwhere $I = q\\lambda$ is the average DC current. This result stems from the Wiener-Khinchin theorem applied to the autocorrelation function of a series of delta-function current pulses representing the charge transfers. The autocorrelation of the current fluctuations $\\delta i(t) = i(t) - I$ is $R_{\\delta i}(\\tau) = qI\\delta(\\tau)$, and its Fourier transform yields a two-sided spectrum $S_I^{\\text{two-sided}}(f) = qI$. The single-sided spectrum, valid for $f \\geq 0$, is $S_I(f) = 2S_I^{\\text{two-sided}}(f) = 2qI$.\n\nThus, the frequency-independent current noise PSD associated with discrete charge transfers is:\n$$S_{I}^{\\mathrm{shot}}(f) = 2qI$$\n\n**2. Flicker Noise from Barrier Height Fluctuations**\n\nThe current $I$ in a Schottky diode due to thermionic emission depends exponentially on the barrier height $\\Phi_{B}$:\n$$I = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q\\Phi_{B}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant that depends on temperature, device area, and material properties, but not on $\\Phi_{B}$.\n\nThe barrier height is subject to small, slow fluctuations: $\\Phi_{B}(t) = \\bar{\\Phi}_{B} + \\delta\\Phi_{B}(t)$, where $\\bar{\\Phi}_{B}$ is the mean barrier height and $\\delta\\Phi_{B}(t)$ is the time-varying fluctuation. This induces a current fluctuation $\\delta I(t)$. We can relate the fluctuations using a first-order Taylor series expansion (linearization), which is justified by the assumption that $\\delta\\Phi_{B}(t)$ is small:\n$$\\delta I(t) \\approx \\frac{dI}{d\\Phi_{B}}\\bigg|_{\\Phi_{B}=\\bar{\\Phi}_{B}} \\delta\\Phi_{B}(t)$$\nLet $I$ denote the average current $I(\\bar{\\Phi}_{B})$. The derivative is:\n$$\\frac{dI}{d\\Phi_{B}} = \\frac{d}{d\\Phi_{B}} \\left[C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q\\Phi_{B}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\\right] = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q\\Phi_{B}}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{q}{k_{B}T}\\right) = -I \\frac{q}{k_{B}T}$$\nSo, the current fluctuation is linearly related to the barrier height fluctuation:\n$$\\delta I(t) = -\\left(\\frac{qI}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\delta\\Phi_{B}(t)$$\nThe power spectral density of the output of a linear time-invariant system is the input PSD multiplied by the square of the magnitude of the system's transfer function. Here, the \"transfer function\" is the constant of proportionality $-\\frac{qI}{k_{B}T}$.\nTherefore, the PSD of the current fluctuations, $S_{I}^{\\mathrm{flicker}}(f)$, is related to the PSD of the barrier height fluctuations, $S_{\\Phi}(f)$, by:\n$$S_{I}^{\\mathrm{flicker}}(f) = \\left|-\\frac{qI}{k_{B}T}\\right|^2 S_{\\Phi}(f)$$\nThis gives the required relationship:\n$$S_{I}^{\\mathrm{flicker}}(f) = \\left(\\frac{qI}{k_{B}T}\\right)^2 S_{\\Phi}(f)$$\n\n**3. Explicit Low-Frequency Flicker Noise PSD**\n\nThe problem provides the specific form for the barrier fluctuation PSD:\n$$S_{\\Phi}(f) = \\frac{A}{f}$$\nSubstituting this into the result from Part 2 yields the explicit expression for the low-frequency flicker noise current PSD:\n$$S_{I}^{\\mathrm{flicker}}(f) = \\left(\\frac{qI}{k_{B}T}\\right)^2 \\frac{A}{f} = \\frac{A(qI)^2}{(k_B T)^2 f}$$\n\n**4. Crossover Frequency**\n\nThe crossover frequency, $f_{c}$, is defined as the frequency at which the magnitudes of the shot noise PSD and the flicker noise PSD are equal.\n$$S_{I}^{\\mathrm{shot}}(f_{c}) = S_{I}^{\\mathrm{flicker}}(f_{c})$$\nUsing the expressions derived in Parts 1 and 3:\n$$2qI = \\frac{A(qI)^2}{(k_B T)^2 f_{c}}$$\nWe now solve for $f_{c}$:\n$$f_{c} \\cdot (2qI) = \\frac{A(qI)^2}{(k_B T)^2}$$\n$$f_{c} = \\frac{A(qI)^2}{(k_B T)^2 (2qI)}$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling common terms:\n$$f_{c} = \\frac{A q I}{2 (k_B T)^2}$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the crossover frequency. Below $f_{c}$, the $1/f$ flicker noise dominates, and above $f_{c}$, the white shot noise dominates the noise spectrum.",

Therefore, the relationship between the small-signal fluctuations is:\n$$\n\\delta I_{D}(t) = -g_m \\delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}(t)\n$$\nThe power spectral density (PSD) of a signal scaled by a constant is scaled by the square of that constant. Thus, the relationship between the single-sided PSDs of the current and voltage fluctuations is:\n$$\nS_{I}(f) = (-g_m)^2 S_{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}(f) = g_m^2 S_{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}(f)\n$$\nWe can solve for the equivalent threshold voltage fluctuation PSD, $S_{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}(f)$:\n$$\nS_{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}(f) = \\frac{S_{I}(f)}{g_m^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nS_{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}(f) = \\frac{1}{(2.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A/V})^2} \\left( \\frac{3.60 \\times 10^{-17}}{f}\\ \\mathrm{A^{2}/Hz} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nS_{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}(f) = \\frac{1}{4.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{A^2/V^2}} \\left( \\frac{3.60 \\times 10^{-17}}{f}\\ \\mathrm{A^{2}/Hz} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nS_{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}(f) = \\frac{3.60 \\times 10^{-17}}{4.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\cdot f}\\ \\mathrm{V^2/Hz} = \\frac{9.00 \\times 10^{-12}}{f}\\ \\mathrm{V^2/Hz}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculation of the predicted RMS fluctuation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pred}}$**\n\nThe variance of the threshold voltage, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pred}}^2$, is found by integrating its PSD over the specified frequency bandwidth, from $f_L$ to $f_H$.\nThe integration limits are:\n-   Lower limit: $f_L = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{obs}}} = \\frac{1}{100\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 0.01\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n-   Upper limit: $f_H = 1.00 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nThe integral for the variance is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pred}}^2 = \\int_{f_L}^{f_H} S_{V_{\\mathrm{th}}}(f)\\, df = \\int_{0.01}^{1000} \\frac{9.00 \\times 10^{-12}}{f}\\, df\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pred}}^2 = (9.00 \\times 10^{-12}) \\int_{0.01}^{1000} \\frac{1}{f}\\, df = (9.00 \\times 10^{-12}) [\\ln|f|]_{0.01}^{1000}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pred}}^2 = (9.00 \\times 10^{-12}) (\\ln(1000) - \\ln(0.01))\n$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pred}}^2 = (9.00 \\times 10^{-12}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1000}{0.01}\\right) = (9.00 \\times 10^{-12}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{10^3}{10^{-2}}\\right) = (9.00 \\times 10^{-12}) \\ln(10^5)\n$$\nThe predicted RMS fluctuation, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pred}}$, is the square root of the variance:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pred}} = \\sqrt{(9.00 \\times 10^{-12}) \\ln(10^5)}\\ \\mathrm{V} = (3.00 \\times 10^{-6}) \\sqrt{\\ln(10^5)}\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically:\n$$\n\\ln(10^5) \\approx 11.512925\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pred}} \\approx (3.00 \\times 10^{-6}) \\sqrt{11.512925}\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pred}} \\approx (3.00 \\times 10^{-6}) \\cdot (3.393070)\\ \\mathrm{V} \\approx 10.17921 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of the consistency ratio $r$**\n\nThe consistency ratio is defined as $r = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{obs}} / \\sigma_{\\mathrm{pred}}$.
