            "problem": "A silicon $p$-$n$ junction diode is forward biased by an ideal (noise-free) voltage source through a series resistor. You are asked to compare the contribution of carrier discreteness in the diode to the equilibrium fluctuations of the resistor by referring both to the same measurable quantity: the small-signal current fluctuations in the single series branch. Work under the following device and operating assumptions:\n\n- The diode is diffusion-dominated with ideality factor $n=1.00$ at temperature $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- The steady forward current is $I=1.00\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$.\n- The series resistor has value $R_{s}=10.0\\,\\Omega$ and is at the same temperature $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- The supply is an ideal voltage source (zero internal impedance and no noise).\n- Low-frequency operation: neglect $1/f$ noise and generation-recombination noise; treat all noise sources as white within the band of interest.\n- Treat the diode with its small-signal dynamic resistance and a current noise source associated with charge discreteness.

            "solution": "The problem requires a comparison of the shot noise contribution from a forward-biased $p$-$n$ junction diode and the thermal noise contribution from a series resistor to the total current noise in the circuit. We will model the noise sources, construct a small-signal equivalent circuit, and then calculate the ratio of their respective contributions to the branch current noise spectral density.\n\nFirst, we define the noise sources based on fundamental principles.\n\n1.  **Diode Shot Noise:** The current in a $p$-$n$ junction arises from discrete charge carriers (electrons and holes) crossing the potential barrier of the depletion region. This flow is a random process. Under forward bias, the net current $I$ is the difference between a large forward-injection current $I_f$ and a small reverse saturation current $I_s$. Both $I_f$ and $I_s$ are due to random carrier arrival, each constituting a Poisson process. The total mean-square shot noise current spectral density, $S_{i,d}(f)$, is the sum of the noise from these two independent flows:\n    $$S_{i,d}(f) = 2qI_f + 2qI_s = 2q(I_f + I_s)$$\n    The diode's current-voltage relationship is given by $I = I_f - I_s = I_s(\\exp(\\frac{qV}{nk_BT}) - 1)$. From this, we can write the forward current as $I_f = I + I_s$. Substituting this into the noise expression gives:\n    $$S_{i,d}(f) = 2q(I + 2I_s)$$\n    For a diode with a forward current of $I=1.00\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$, this current is many orders of magnitude larger than the typical reverse saturation current $I_s$ (which is often in the picoampere to nanoampere range for silicon). Therefore, we can make the excellent approximation $I \\gg I_s$, which simplifies the noise spectral density to the standard Schottky formula:\n    $$S_{i,d}(f) \\approx 2qI$$\n    This is a white noise source, so its spectral density is independent of frequency $f$ in the range of interest.\n\n2.  **Resistor Thermal Noise:** The thermal agitation of charge carriers in a resistor at thermal equilibrium results in random voltage fluctuations across its terminals. This is known as Johnson-Nyquist noise. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem dictates that the mean-square thermal noise voltage spectral density, $S_{v,s}(f)$, for a resistor $R_s$ at temperature $T$ is:\n    $$S_{v,s}(f) = 4k_BTR_s$$\n    where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. This is also a white noise source. We will model this noise as a Thevenin equivalent voltage source $v_{ns}$ in series with the noiseless resistor $R_s$.\n\nNext, we establish the small-signal model for the circuit. The ideal DC voltage source has zero internal impedance and thus acts as an AC ground. The circuit consists of the series resistor $R_s$ and the diode. The diode is replaced by its small-signal equivalent: its dynamic resistance, $r_d$, in parallel with its shot noise current source, $i_{nd}$, which has a spectral density $S_{i,d}(f)$.\n\nThe diode's dynamic resistance $r_d$ is the inverse of its dynamic conductance $g_d = \\frac{dI}{dV}$:\n$$g_d = \\frac{d}{dV} \\left[ I_s \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{nk_BT}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\right] = \\frac{qI_s}{nk_BT} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{nk_BT}\\right)$$\nRecognizing that $I + I_s = I_s \\exp(\\frac{qV}{nk_BT})$, we have:\n$$g_d = \\frac{q(I+I_s)}{nk_BT}$$\nApplying the same approximation $I \\gg I_s$, we get:\n$$g_d \\approx \\frac{qI}{nk_BT}$$\nThus, the dynamic resistance is:\n$$r_d = \\frac{1}{g_d} \\approx \\frac{nk_BT}{qI}$$\nThe small-signal AC equivalent circuit for noise analysis comprises the resistor $R_s$ with its series noise voltage source $v_{ns}$, connected in series with the diode's dynamic resistance $r_d$. The diode's noise is represented by a current source $i_{nd}$ in parallel with $r_d$. To facilitate analysis in a series circuit, we can convert the diode's Norton noise model (current source $i_{nd}$ in parallel with $r_d$) to its Thevenin equivalent: a voltage source $v_{nd} = i_{nd}r_d$ in series with $r_d$. The spectral density of this equivalent voltage source is:\n$$S_{v,d}(f) = S_{i,d}(f) r_d^2 = (2qI) r_d^2$$\nNow, the complete small-signal noise equivalent circuit is a single loop containing two noiseless resistors, $R_s$ and $r_d$, and two uncorrelated series noise voltage sources, $v_{ns}$ and $v_{nd}$, with spectral densities $S_{v,s}(f)$ and $S_{v,d}(f)$ respectively.\n\nThe total series impedance of the branch is $Z_{tot} = R_s + r_d$. The branch current fluctuation, $\\delta i_{branch}$, is caused by these two noise sources. Since they are uncorrelated, we can find the total mean-square current noise spectral density, $S_{i,branch}(f)$, by summing the contributions from each source:\n$$S_{i,branch}(f) = S_{i,branch,d}(f) + S_{i,branch,s}(f)$$\nThe contribution from the diode's noise source $v_{nd}$ is:\n$$S_{i,branch,d}(f) = \\frac{S_{v,d}(f)}{(R_s+r_d)^2} = \\frac{2qI r_d^2}{(R_s+r_d)^2}$$\nThe contribution from the resistor's noise source $v_{ns}$ is:\n$$S_{i,branch,s}(f) = \\frac{S_{v,s}(f)}{(R_s+r_d)^2} = \\frac{4k_BTR_s}{(R_s+r_d)^2}$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ of the diode's contribution to the resistor's contribution:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{S_{i,branch,d}(f)}{S_{i,branch,s}(f)} = \\frac{\\frac{2qI r_d^2}{(R_s+r_d)^2}}{\\frac{4k_BTR_s}{(R_s+r_d)^2}}$$\nThe denominator term $(R_s+r_d)^2$ cancels, yielding:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{2qI r_d^2}{4k_BTR_s} = \\frac{qI r_d^2}{2k_BTR_s}$$\nThis is an intermediate expression for the ratio. To obtain a result in terms of the given parameters, we substitute the expression for $r_d$:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{qI}{2k_BTR_s} \\left( \\frac{nk_BT}{qI} \\right)^2 = \\frac{qI}{2k_BTR_s} \\frac{n^2(k_BT)^2}{(qI)^2}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final symbolic form for the ratio:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{n^2 k_B T}{2qI R_s}$$\nAn alternative insightful form is $\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{n r_d}{2 R_s}$, which highlights that the ratio of noise contributions is directly related to the ratio of the dynamic and static resistances in the circuit.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values:\n- Ideality factor $n = 1.00$\n- Temperature $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- DC current $I = 1.00\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- Series resistance $R_s = 10.0\\,\\Omega$\n- Elementary charge $q = 1.602\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- Boltzmann constant $k_B = 1.381\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\mathcal{R}$:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{(1.00)^2 \\times (1.381\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{2 \\times (1.602\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) \\times (1.00\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}) \\times (10.0\\,\\Omega)}$$\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{4.143\\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{3.204\\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}}$$\n$$\\mathcal{R} \\approx 1.29307116$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $\\mathcal{R} \\approx 1.293$.

            "solution": "The objective is to estimate the diode shot noise and propagate it through the measurement network. We begin from the microscopic origin of shot noise in a reverse-biased $p$-$n$ junction.\n\n1.

It reduces the effective noise bandwidth to an equivalent noise bandwidth $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{df}{1+(2\\pi f R_{L} C_{\\text{in})}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{4 R_{L} C_{\\text{in}}}$, thereby lowering the integrated output noise amplitude but also slowing response. Larger $C_{\\text{in}}$ diminishes $v_{\\text{rms, shot}} \\propto C_{\\text{in}}^{-1/2}$ and similarly reduces the amplifier’s integrated current noise; however, in practical transimpedance configurations, $C_{\\text{in}}$ also increases noise gain for amplifier voltage noise and can impose stability constraints, making precise shot-noise measurements more challenging at higher capacitance.",

The general Landauer-Büttiker formula for the single-sided, zero-frequency noise spectral density from a single spin-degenerate subband is:\n$$\nS_{I,n}(f=0) = \\frac{4q^2}{h} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dE \\left( \\underbrace{T_n(E) \\left[ f_S(E)(1-f_S(E)) + f_D(E)(1-f_D(E)) \\right]}_{\\text{Thermal Noise}} + \\underbrace{T_n(E)(1-T_n(E)) \\left[ f_S(E) - f_D(E) \\right]^2}_{\\text{Partition Noise}} \\right)\n$$\nThe prefactor of $4q^2/h$ arises from a factor of 2 for spin degeneracy and another factor of 2 to convert from a two-sided to a single-sided power spectral density. The total noise spectral density is the sum over all $N$ subbands, $S_I = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} S_{I,n}$. Here, $q$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $T_n(E)$ is the energy-dependent transmission probability for an electron in subband $n$. The terms $f_S(E)$ and $f_D(E)$ are the Fermi-Dirac distributions for the source and drain reservoirs, respectively:\n$$\nf_S(E) = f(E; \\mu_S, T) = \\left[1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E-\\mu_S}{k_B T}\\right)\\right]^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nf_D(E) = f(E; \\mu_D, T) = \\left[1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E-\\mu_D}{k_B T}\\right)\\right]^{-1}\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\\mu_S$ and $\\mu_D$ are the chemical potentials of the source and drain, given by $\\mu_S = E_F^0$ and $\\mu_D = E_F^0 - qV_{DS}$.\n\nThe model for the MOSFET channel specifies the transmission $T_n(E)$ through a multi-step process. First, the bottom of each subband, $E_n$, is determined by the gate-to-source voltage $V_{GS}$:\n$$\nE_n(V_{GS}) = E_{c0} - q\\,\\alpha\\,(V_{GS} - V_T) + \\left(n+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega_y\n$$\nNext, the energy-dependent mean free path, $\\lambda_n(E)$, for scattering within subband $n$ is defined based on the electron's kinetic energy within the subband, $E - E_n$:\n$$\n\\lambda_n(E) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\lambda_{0,n}\\left(\\dfrac{E - E_n}{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^\\beta, & \\text{for } E \\ge E_n, \\\\\n0, & \\text{for } E < E_n.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFinally, for a channel of length $L$, the transmission probability $T_n(E)$ is given by:\n$$\nT_n(E;L) = \\frac{\\lambda_n(E)}{\\lambda_n(E) + L}\n$$\nThis expression correctly interpolates between the ballistic limit ($L \\ll \\lambda_n \\implies T_n \\to 1$) and the diffusive limit ($L \\gg \\lambda_n \\implies T_n \\to \\lambda_n/L \\ll 1$).\n\nTo compute $S_I$ for each test case, the following numerical procedure is implemented:\n1.  All input parameters and physical constants are converted to and maintained in base SI units (Joules, meters, etc.).\n2.  For each test case, the chemical potentials $\\mu_S$ and $\\mu_D$ are calculated.\n3.  The total noise spectral density $S_I$ is initialized to $0$. The calculation then iterates through each subband $n$ from $0$ to $N-1$.\n4.  For each subband, the subband bottom energy $E_n$ is computed.\n5.  The core of the calculation is the numerical integration over energy $E$. The integration is performed using an adaptive quadrature routine for accuracy. The integration range is chosen to be from $\\min(\\mu_S, \\mu_D) - 15\\,k_B T$ to $\\max(\\mu_S, \\mu_D) + 15\\,k_B T$, which is sufficiently large to capture all significant contributions from the Fermi functions.\n6.  The integral for each subband is calculated and added to a running sum representing the total integral over all subbands.\n7.  After summing the contributions, the total is multiplied by the prefactor $4q^2/h$ to obtain the final value of $S_I$ in units of $\\mathrm{A^2/Hz}$.\n8.  This process is repeated for all five test cases, and the results are collected and formatted as specified.",
