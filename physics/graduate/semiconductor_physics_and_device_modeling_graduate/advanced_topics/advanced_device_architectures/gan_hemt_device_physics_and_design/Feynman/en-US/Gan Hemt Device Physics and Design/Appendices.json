            "solution": "The first task is to compute the expectation value of the electron position, $z_{c}$.

The definition is given as:\n$$z_{c} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} z \\, |\\psi(z)|^{2} \\, dz}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\psi(z)|^{2} \\, dz}$$\nFirst, we construct the probability density function, $|\\psi(z)|^2$.

These random, microscopic height fluctuations $\\Delta(\\vec{\\rho})$, where $\\vec{\\rho} = (x,y)$, create a short-range, spatially fluctuating scattering potential, $V_{IR}(z, \\vec{\\rho})$. This potential is strongest precisely at the interface ($z=0$) and its influence decays rapidly as the distance $z$ from the interface increases.\n\n2.  **Scattering Rate and Wavefunction Overlap**: According to quantum mechanical perturbation theory (specifically, Fermi's Golden Rule), the rate at which an electron in an initial state $|\\psi_i\\rangle$ scatters into a final state $|\\psi_f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element, $|\\langle\\psi_f | V_{IR} | \\psi_i\\rangle|^2$. For intra-subband scattering, which is dominant, the initial and final states belong to the same subband, so we consider the matrix element $\\langle\\psi | V_{IR} | \\psi\\rangle$. This integral represents the strength of the interaction, which is determined by the spatial overlap between the electron probability density $|\\psi(z)|^2$ and the scattering potential $V_{IR}$.\n\n3.  **Role of the Centroid $z_c$**: The centroid of the electron position, $z_c$, is a direct measure of the average distance of the electron cloud from the interface at $z=0$. A smaller value of $z_c$ implies that the peak of the probability density $|\\psi(z)|^2$ is closer to the interface, and the wavefunction is more tightly confined against it. Conversely, a larger $z_c$ indicates that the electron, on average, resides further away from the interface within the GaN channel.\n\n4.  **Connecting $z_c$ to Scattering Strength**: Since the interface roughness scattering potential $V_{IR}$ is localized at $z=0$, the magnitude of the scattering matrix element is critically dependent on the value of the electron probability density $|\\psi(z)|^2$ *near* $z=0$.\n    -   If $z_c$ is **small**, the electron probability density has a significant presence at and near the interface. This results in a large spatial overlap between $|\\psi(z)|^2$ and $V_{IR}(z, \\vec{\\rho})$, leading to a large scattering matrix element. Consequently, the scattering rate is high, which degrades electron mobility.\n    -   If $z_c$ is **large**, the electron is pushed further away from the interface. The probability density $|\\psi(z)|^2$ near $z=0$ is diminished. This reduces the spatial overlap between the wavefunction and the roughness potential, resulting in a smaller scattering matrix element and a lower scattering rate.\n\nIn conclusion, the centroid $z_c$ serves as a crucial parameter that quantifies the proximity of the 2DEG to the source of the interface roughness scattering potential. A smaller centroid position leads to a stronger interaction with the interface imperfections and thus a higher rate of interface roughness scattering.",

The current is found from the voltage:\n$$I(x) = -\\frac{W}{R_{sh}} \\frac{dV}{dx} = -\\frac{W}{R_{sh}L_T} \\left( A \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right) + B \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right) \\right)$$\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  The total current $I_0$ enters the contact region from the channel at $x=0$, so $I(0)=I_0$.\n2.  At the far end of the contact, $x=L_c$, no current flows further into the semiconductor, so $I(L_c)=0$.\n\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n$$A \\sinh(L_c/L_T) + B \\cosh(L_c/L_T) = 0 \\implies B = -A \\tanh(L_c/L_T)$$\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n$$I_0 = I(0) = -\\frac{W}{R_{sh}L_T} (B) \\implies B = -\\frac{I_0 R_{sh} L_T}{W}$$\nThe contact resistance $R_C'$ is defined as the voltage drop at the leading edge of the contact, $V(0)$, divided by the total current $I_0$.\n$$V(0) = A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) = A$$\nWe have $A = -B / \\tanh(L_c/L_T) = \\left(\\frac{I_0 R_{sh} L_T}{W}\\right) / \\tanh(L_c/L_T)$.\nTherefore, the resistance of one contact is:\n$$R_C' = \\frac{V(0)}{I_0} = \\frac{R_{sh} L_T}{W \\tanh(L_c/L_T)} = \\frac{R_{sh} L_T}{W} \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right)$$\nThe problem states that the contact length is much larger than the transfer length, $L_c \\gg L_T$. In this limit, $L_c/L_T \\to \\infty$, and $\\coth(L_c/L_T) \\to 1$. Thus, the contact resistance simplifies to:\n$$R_C' \\approx \\frac{R_{sh} L_T}{W}$$\nSubstituting this and the channel resistance into the expression for the total resistance $R_T$:\n$$R_T = \\frac{R_{sh} L}{W} + 2 \\frac{R_{sh} L_T}{W} = \\frac{R_{sh}}{W} (L + 2L_T)$$\nThis equation shows that $R_T$ is a linear function of the spacing $L$. A plot of $R_T$ versus $L$ yields a straight line with slope $m$ and y-intercept $b$:\n$$m = \\frac{R_{sh}}{W}$$\n$$b = 2 R_C' = \\frac{2 R_{sh} L_T}{W}$$\nFrom these relations, the sheet resistance $R_{sh}$ can be extracted from the slope:\n$$R_{sh} = m \\cdot W$$\nThe transfer length $L_T$ can be extracted from the slope and intercept. For instance, the x-intercept of the line, $L_x$, where $R_T=0$, is given by $L_x = -2L_T$. Thus, $L_T = -L_x/2$. Alternatively, by dividing the intercept by the slope: $\\frac{b}{m} = \\frac{2 R_{sh} L_T / W}{R_{sh} / W} = 2L_T$, which gives $L_T = \\frac{b}{2m}$.\n\nNow, we apply this model to the provided data. The data points are $(1, 40.8)$, $(2, 64.8)$, $(4, 112.8)$, $(8, 208.8)$, $(16, 400.8)$, where $L$ is in $\\mu\\text{m}$ and $R_T$ is in $\\Omega$. We perform a linear fit of $R_T = mL+b$.\nWe observe that the data lie perfectly on a line. The slope $m$ can be calculated from any two points. For example, using the first two points:\n$$m = \\frac{64.8\\,\\Omega - 40.8\\,\\Omega}{2\\,\\mu\\text{m} - 1\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = \\frac{24\\,\\Omega}{1\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = 24\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m}$$\nThis slope is consistent across all data points.\nThe y-intercept $b$ can be found by extrapolating to $L=0$:\n$$b = R_T - m L = 40.8\\,\\Omega - (24\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m})(1\\,\\mu\\text{m}) = 16.8\\,\\Omega$$\nThe linear fit is $R_T(\\Omega) = 24 L(\\mu\\text{m}) + 16.8$.\n\nWith $W = 20\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, we can now extract $R_{sh}$:\n$$R_{sh} = m \\cdot W = (24\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m}) \\cdot (20\\,\\mu\\text{m}) = 480\\,\\Omega$$\nSo, the sheet resistance is $R_{sh} = 480\\,\\Omega/\\text{sq}$.\n\nThe y-intercept represents the total resistance of the two contacts, $2R_C' = 16.8\\,\\Omega$.\nThe resistance of a single contact is $R_C' = 16.8\\,\\Omega / 2 = 8.4\\,\\Omega$.\n\nThe problem asks for the contact resistance normalized to width, $R_c$, in units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{mm}$. This quantity is defined as $R_c = R_C' \\cdot W$.\n$$R_c = (8.4\\,\\Omega) \\cdot (20\\,\\mu\\text{m}) = 168\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mu\\text{m}$$\nWe must convert this result to the required units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{mm}$. Since $1\\,\\text{mm} = 1000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, or $1\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 10^{-3}\\,\\text{mm}$:\n$$R_c = 168\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mu\\text{m} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{mm}}{1000\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = 0.168\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{mm}$$\nFinally, we round the result to four significant figures as requested.\n$$R_c = 0.1680\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{mm}$$\n\nAs a consistency check, we can calculate the transfer length $L_T$:\n$$L_T = \\frac{b}{2m} = \\frac{16.8\\,\\Omega}{2 \\cdot (24\\,\\Omega/\\mu\\text{m})} = \\frac{16.8}{48}\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.35\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\nThe condition $L_c \\gg L_T$ prerequisite for the simplified model is satisfied for typical contact lengths used in fabrication (e.g., $L_c > 5 L_T = 1.75\\,\\mu\\text{m}$). The derived value for $R_c$ is physically reasonable for high-quality ohmic contacts to an AlGaN/GaN 2DEG.",
