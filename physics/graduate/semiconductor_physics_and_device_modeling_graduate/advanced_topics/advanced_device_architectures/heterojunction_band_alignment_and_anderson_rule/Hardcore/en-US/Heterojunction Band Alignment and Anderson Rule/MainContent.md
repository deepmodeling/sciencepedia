## Introduction
The interface between two dissimilar semiconductors, known as a [heterojunction](@entry_id:196407), is a fundamental building block of modern electronics and optoelectronics. The ability to engineer the flow of electrons and holes across this junction underpins the operation of high-speed transistors, efficient lasers, and sensitive photodetectors. The critical factor governing device performance is the alignment of the respective energy bands at the interface, which creates the potential barriers and wells that confine or guide charge carriers. This article addresses the essential problem of how to predict and understand this [band alignment](@entry_id:137089), from idealized first principles to the complexities of real-world systems.

To provide a comprehensive understanding, this exploration is structured into three main parts. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, establishes the theoretical foundation, beginning with the simple yet powerful Anderson's rule and defining key concepts like [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) and band offsets. It then delves into the physics of real interfaces, explaining how phenomena such as strain, interface dipoles, and polarization fields cause significant deviations from this ideal model. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, demonstrates how these principles are harnessed to design revolutionary devices, including high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) and [quantum well](@entry_id:140115) lasers, and explores connections to materials science and bandgap engineering. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** chapter provides opportunities to apply these concepts through targeted problems, reinforcing the theoretical knowledge with practical calculation and analysis.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The behavior of charge carriers at the junction between two dissimilar semiconductors—a heterojunction—is governed by the alignment of their respective energy bands. This alignment dictates the potential barriers and wells that confine or repel electrons and holes, forming the foundation for a vast array of modern electronic and [optoelectronic devices](@entry_id:1129187). This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles and mechanisms that determine this [band alignment](@entry_id:137089), beginning with the idealized model and progressively incorporating the complex physical phenomena that characterize real-world interfaces.

### The Ideal Heterojunction: Anderson's Rule

To construct a model of a heterojunction, we must first define the key energy references. The most fundamental reference is the **[vacuum level](@entry_id:756402)**, denoted as $E_{vac}$. It represents the energy of a stationary electron just outside the surface of the solid, free from the influence of the crystal lattice. All electronic energy levels within the semiconductor are measured relative to this level.

Within the semiconductor, the allowed energy states for electrons form bands. The most critical for device operation are the **conduction band**, whose lowest energy is the **conduction band minimum (CBM)**, $E_c$, and the **valence band**, whose highest energy is the **valence band maximum (VBM)**, $E_v$. The energy difference between these two is the fundamental **bandgap**, $E_g = E_c - E_v$.

Two intrinsic material properties, defined with respect to the vacuum level, are crucial for describing heterojunctions :

1.  **Electron Affinity ($\chi$)**: The energy required to move an electron from the conduction band minimum ($E_c$) to the vacuum level ($E_{vac}$). Mathematically, $\chi = E_{vac} - E_c$.
2.  **Ionization Energy ($I$)**: The energy required to move an electron from the valence band maximum ($E_v$) to the [vacuum level](@entry_id:756402) ($E_{vac}$). Mathematically, $I = E_{vac} - E_v$.

From these definitions, it is clear that the ionization energy, electron affinity, and bandgap are related by the simple identity $I = \chi + E_g$.

It is essential to distinguish these intrinsic properties from the **work function ($\Phi$)**, which is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the solid to the vacuum level. This electron originates from the **Fermi level ($E_F$)**, which represents the electrochemical potential of the electrons. Thus, $\Phi = E_{vac} - E_F$. For a semiconductor, the Fermi level's position within the bandgap is determined by doping and temperature. Consequently, the work function can be expressed as $\Phi = \chi + (E_c - E_F)$. Unlike electron affinity, the work function is not an intrinsic property of the semiconductor material itself but also depends on its extrinsic doping.

The simplest model for determining the band alignment at a [heterojunction](@entry_id:196407) is **Anderson's rule**, or the [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) rule . This model applies to an idealized interface that is abrupt, lattice-matched, and free of any defects, interface states, or [electric dipoles](@entry_id:186870) . The central postulate of Anderson's rule is that the **[vacuum level](@entry_id:756402) is continuous across the interface**. This vacuum-level alignment provides a common energy reference for both semiconductors.

Under this assumption, the discontinuities, or "offsets," in the conduction and valence bands at the interface can be directly calculated from the electron affinities of the two materials, labeled $A$ and $B$. The [conduction band offset](@entry_id:1122863), $\Delta E_c$, is defined as the difference in the CBM across the junction:
$$ \Delta E_c = E_{c,B} - E_{c,A} = (E_{vac} - \chi_B) - (E_{vac} - \chi_A) = \chi_A - \chi_B $$
The [valence band offset](@entry_id:1133686), $\Delta E_v$, is the difference in the VBM:
$$ \Delta E_v = E_{v,B} - E_{v,A} = (E_{vac} - I_B) - (E_{vac} - I_A) = I_A - I_B $$
Using the relationship $I = \chi + E_g$, the [valence band offset](@entry_id:1133686) can also be expressed in terms of the [conduction band offset](@entry_id:1122863) and the bandgaps:
$$ \Delta E_v = (\chi_A + E_{g,A}) - (\chi_B + E_{g,B}) = (\chi_A - \chi_B) + (E_{g,A} - E_{g,B}) = \Delta E_c + (E_{g,A} - E_{g,B}) $$
Note that the band offsets $\Delta E_c$ and $\Delta E_v$ are intrinsic properties of the material pair, independent of doping, within this ideal model.

For example, consider an ideal heterojunction between semiconductor A ($\chi_A = 4.10 \, \mathrm{eV}, E_{g,A} = 1.10 \, \mathrm{eV}$) and semiconductor B ($\chi_B = 3.60 \, \mathrm{eV}, E_{g,B} = 2.00 \, \mathrm{eV}$) . According to Anderson's rule, the conduction band offset would be $\Delta E_c = 4.10 \, \mathrm{eV} - 3.60 \, \mathrm{eV} = 0.50 \, \mathrm{eV}$. This means the conduction band of material B is $0.50 \, \mathrm{eV}$ higher than that of material A. The corresponding [valence band offset](@entry_id:1133686) is $\Delta E_v = 0.50 \, \mathrm{eV} + (1.10 \, \mathrm{eV} - 2.00 \, \mathrm{eV}) = -0.40 \, \mathrm{eV}$, meaning the valence band of B is $0.40 \, \mathrm{eV}$ lower than that of A.

### Equilibrium, Charge Transfer, and Band Bending

When two semiconductors with different doping profiles are brought into contact, the system is initially not in equilibrium. It reaches **[thermodynamic equilibrium](@entry_id:141660)** only when there is no net flow of charge or energy across the junction. This state is characterized by a single, uniform **Fermi level ($E_F$)** that is constant throughout the entire [heterostructure](@entry_id:144260) .

The drive to establish this uniform Fermi level is the initial difference in the work functions of the isolated materials. Electrons flow from the material with the higher Fermi level (lower work function) to the material with the lower Fermi level (higher work function). This transfer of charge does not occur throughout the bulk but is confined to a region near the interface. For instance, in an n-type/p-type junction, electrons from the n-side flow to the p-side, leaving behind a region of uncompensated positive ionized [donor atoms](@entry_id:156278) on the n-side and creating a region of negative ionized acceptor atoms on the p-side.

This layer of separated charges, known as the **space-charge region**, creates a **built-in electric field**. The direction of this field is from the region of net positive charge to the region of net negative charge. By calculating the pre-contact work functions, one can predict the direction of charge flow and thus the direction of this field . Associated with this field is a **[built-in potential](@entry_id:137446)**, which varies across the space-charge region. This electrostatic potential causes the energy bands to "bend." An electron moving against the electric field gains potential energy, so its energy levels ($E_c, E_v, E_{vac}$) are shifted upwards.

Crucially, this [band bending](@entry_id:271304) occurs in the space-charge regions away from the interface. The intrinsic band offsets, $\Delta E_c$ and $\Delta E_v$, are properties of the atomic-scale junction itself and are preserved. The final equilibrium band diagram is therefore a superposition of two effects: the abrupt, intrinsic discontinuities at the interface as predicted by a lineup model like Anderson's rule, and the smooth, long-range [band bending](@entry_id:271304) in the adjacent regions that ensures the Fermi level is flat everywhere.

### Classification of Band Alignments

The relative positions of the conduction and valence band edges determine the type of the [heterojunction](@entry_id:196407), which has profound implications for carrier confinement and device design. There are three primary types of [band alignment](@entry_id:137089) :

-   **Type I (Straddling) Alignment**: In this configuration, the bandgap of the narrower-gap semiconductor is entirely contained within the bandgap of the wider-gap semiconductor. This means the CBM of the narrow-gap material is below that of the wide-gap material, and its VBM is above that of the wide-gap material. The product of the offsets is negative: $\Delta E_c \cdot \Delta E_v  0$. This alignment creates a [potential well](@entry_id:152140) for both electrons and holes in the same narrow-gap material, which is ideal for devices like [quantum well](@entry_id:140115) lasers where [electron-hole recombination](@entry_id:187424) is desired.

-   **Type II (Staggered) Alignment**: Here, both the CBM and VBM of one semiconductor are lower (or higher) in energy than the corresponding bands of the other. The offsets have the same sign: $\Delta E_c \cdot \Delta E_v > 0$. This alignment leads to the spatial separation of charge carriers: electrons are confined in one material, while holes are confined in the adjacent material. This is useful for photodetectors and certain types of transistors.

-   **Type III (Broken-Gap) Alignment**: In this more extreme case, the CBM of one material lies below the VBM of the other. There is no overlapping energy range where a common bandgap exists across the junction. Mathematically, this can be expressed by conditions like $\Delta E_c \le -E_{g,A}$ or $\Delta E_v \ge E_{g,A}$. This alignment facilitates tunneling between the valence band of one material and the conduction band of the other, a property exploited in tunnel diodes.

### Departures from Ideality: The Physics of Real Interfaces

Anderson's rule provides an invaluable conceptual starting point, but its underlying assumption of an ideal interface is rarely met in practice. The [band alignment](@entry_id:137089) at real heterojunctions is influenced by a host of complex physical phenomena that can cause significant deviations from this simple model. Understanding these effects is critical for accurate device modeling and engineering.

#### Interface Dipoles and Chemical Bonding

The core assumption of Anderson's rule—a continuous vacuum level—is equivalent to assuming there is no sheet of [electric dipoles](@entry_id:186870) at the interface . A dipole sheet, with moment density $p$, creates a discontinuous step in the electrostatic potential, $\Delta\phi = p/\varepsilon_0$, which rigidly shifts all electronic energy levels on one side relative to the other by an amount $q\Delta\phi$. This directly breaks the vacuum-level alignment and modifies the band offsets.

A primary source of such dipoles is the [chemical bonding](@entry_id:138216) at the interface itself, especially at **heterovalent** junctions, such as between a III-V (e.g., GaAs) and a II-VI (e.g., ZnSe) semiconductor. The difference in [electronegativity](@entry_id:147633) between the atoms forming bonds across the interface (e.g., Ga-Se or As-Zn) causes a partial [charge transfer](@entry_id:150374), polarizing each bond. The collective effect of these polarized bonds is a macroscopic dipole sheet. Order-of-magnitude estimates show that this chemically-[induced dipole](@entry_id:143340) can alter the band offsets by hundreds of millielectronvolts, a significant correction that often dominates over the simple [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) difference .

#### Strain Effects in Pseudomorphic Heterostructures

When a thin semiconductor layer is grown epitaxially on a substrate with a slightly different lattice constant, it can grow coherently by straining to match the substrate's in-plane lattice. This is known as **pseudomorphic** growth. The resulting [biaxial strain](@entry_id:1121545) within the thin layer has a profound effect on its band structure, which must be accounted for using **[deformation potential theory](@entry_id:140142)** .

Strain affects the valence band in two key ways:
1.  A **hydrostatic component** of strain shifts the average energy of the valence bands.
2.  A **shear component** of strain breaks the cubic symmetry of the crystal, lifting the degeneracy of the valence bands at the zone center. This splits the **heavy-hole (HH)** and **light-hole (LH)** bands.

For the common case of a compressively strained layer grown on a (001) substrate (e.g., InGaAs on GaAs), the HH band moves to a higher energy, while the LH band moves to a lower energy. This strain-induced shift must be added to the unstrained band offset. The result can be dramatic: an alignment that is Type I for both carriers in the unstrained case can become Type I for heavy holes (creating a deeper [potential well](@entry_id:152140)) but Type II for light holes (creating a barrier that repels them from the well). This selective confinement is a powerful tool used in strain-engineered lasers and high-mobility transistors.

#### Interface States and Fermi-Level Pinning

Even at a perfectly-ordered, isovalent interface, quantum mechanics dictates that the electronic wavefunctions from one material must decay (become evanescent) into the bandgap of the other. The mixing of these evanescent states with the [continuum of states](@entry_id:198338) across the interface gives rise to a new set of states localized at the interface, which can exist at energies within the bandgap. These are known as **Metal-Induced Gap States (MIGS)** in metal-semiconductor contacts, but the concept applies to semiconductor-semiconductor junctions as well .

These [interface states](@entry_id:1126595) have a character that transitions from valence-band-like at lower energies to conduction-band-like at higher energies. There exists a specific energy, the **Charge Neutrality Level (CNL)**, at which the states are, on net, charge-neutral. If the Fermi level at the interface, $E_F$, lies above the CNL, the states become negatively charged; if $E_F$ is below the CNL, they become positively charged.

This charging of interface states provides a powerful negative feedback mechanism. Any attempt to move the Fermi level away from the CNL (e.g., by changing the work function of an adjoining metal) induces a charge in the [interface states](@entry_id:1126595). This charge creates an [interface dipole](@entry_id:143726) that opposes the initial shift, pushing the Fermi level back towards the CNL. If the density of [interface states](@entry_id:1126595) is high, this effect is so strong that the Fermi level becomes effectively "pinned" near the CNL, making the band alignment largely insensitive to the work functions of the constituent materials. This phenomenon of **Fermi-level pinning** is a major deviation from Anderson's rule and is crucial for understanding contacts and interfaces.

#### Polarization Effects in Polar Heterojunctions

In polar semiconductors, such as those with the [wurtzite crystal structure](@entry_id:203920) (e.g., GaN, AlN, ZnO), the lack of [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948) leads to a built-in **[spontaneous polarization](@entry_id:141025)**. Furthermore, strain in these materials can induce an additional **piezoelectric polarization**. At a heterojunction between two such materials, a discontinuity in the total [polarization vector](@entry_id:269389) creates a fixed sheet of [bound charge](@entry_id:142144) at the interface .

The magnitude of this polarization-induced charge can be enormous (on the order of $10^{13} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$), generating intense internal electric fields on the order of MV/cm. This results in a sharp, continuous change in the electrostatic potential across the interface, rather than a flat [vacuum level](@entry_id:756402). This represents a macroscopic and catastrophic failure of the fundamental premise of Anderson's rule. For polar heterostructures, band alignment cannot be predicted by simple electron affinities. Instead, one must perform a self-consistent calculation, solving the **Poisson equation** with the polarization-induced charge acting as a boundary condition, to determine the band profile. This effect is dominant in III-nitride devices and is responsible for the formation of high-density two-dimensional electron gases.

### A Note on Experimental Determination

The parameters used in these models, such as electron affinities and band offsets, are determined experimentally. Techniques like **ultraviolet and X-ray [photoelectron spectroscopy](@entry_id:143961) (UPS/XPS)** can directly probe the electronic energy levels near a surface, allowing measurement of the work function and the position of the valence band edge relative to the Fermi level. However, real surfaces often exhibit **[band bending](@entry_id:271304)** due to [surface states](@entry_id:137922) or adsorbates. Therefore, careful electrostatic modeling, often involving solving the Poisson equation, is required to correct for these effects and extract the intrinsic, flat-band material parameters needed for lineup theories .
