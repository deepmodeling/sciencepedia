The transmission probability across this barrier is to be estimated using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. Assume the tunneling proceeds between a valence-band initial state and a conduction-band final state with an effective reduced mass $m_r$.

Assume nondegenerate injection so that the thermionic occupation of carriers able to surmount the barrier is controlled by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics at temperature $T$. Use the Landauer formalism to estimate the low-bias current as the product of the low-bias conductance and $V_{SD}$, with the conductance determined by the transmission and the occupancy of available states.\n\nStarting from first principles — the Landauer current expression and the WKB transmission through a triangular barrier — derive analytic expressions for the TFET ON current and the MOSFET thermionic current under the stated assumptions.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the ratio of the ON-state current of a Tunnel Field-Effect Transistor (TFET) to the thermionic current of a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) under specific simplifying assumptions. Both currents are to be modeled using the Landauer formalism in the low-bias, single-mode, ballistic transport regime.\n\nFirst, we establish the general framework. The Landauer formula for current through a single-mode one-dimensional channel is given by:\n$$ I = \\frac{g_s q}{h} \\int \\mathcal{T}(E) [f_S(E) - f_D(E)] dE $$\nwhere $g_s$ is the spin degeneracy (given as $g_s=2$), $q$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is Planck's constant, $\\mathcal{T}(E)$ is the transmission probability at energy $E$, and $f_S(E)$ and $f_D(E)$ are the Fermi-Dirac distributions for the source and drain, respectively.\n\nFor a small source-drain voltage $V_{SD}$, the difference in Fermi levels is $E_{FS} - E_{FD} = q V_{SD}$. The difference in Fermi functions can be approximated as:\n$$ f_S(E) - f_D(E) \\approx -\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E} (E_{FS} - E_{FD}) = -\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E} q V_{SD} $$\nThis leads to the low-bias current expression $I = G V_{SD}$, where the conductance $G$ is:\n$$ G = \\frac{g_s q^2}{h} \\int \\mathcal{T}(E) \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E}\\right) dE $$\nHowever, the physical mechanisms governing transmission $\\mathcal{T}(E)$ and the relevant energy ranges are different for the TFET and the MOSFET. The problem statement guides the use of a simplified low-bias model where $I = G V_{SD}$.\n\n**1. TFET Current ($I_{\\mathrm{TFET}}$)**\nFor the TFET, the current is due to band-to-band tunneling (BTBT). The problem specifies modeling this with the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation for a triangular potential barrier. The barrier has a height equal to the bandgap $E_g$ and is created by a uniform electric field $F$.\n\nThe WKB transmission probability $\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E)$ for a particle of mass $m_r$ tunneling through a potential barrier $V(x)$ is:\n$$ \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E) \\approx \\exp\\left(-2 \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\frac{\\sqrt{2m_r(V(x)-E)}}{\\hbar} dx\\right) $$\nwhere $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the classical turning points. For a triangular barrier of height $E_g$ and slope $qF$, the potential is $V(x) = E_g - qFx$ for $x0$. We consider an electron tunneling at the valence band edge, for which the energy can be set to $E=0$. The turning points are $x_1=0$ and $x_2$, where $V(x_2)=0$, which yields $x_2 = E_g / (qF)$.\n\nThe integral in the exponent is:\n$$ \\int_0^{E_g/(qF)} \\sqrt{2m_r(E_g - qFx)} dx $$\nLet $u = E_g - qFx$, so $du = -qF dx$. The limits of integration become $u=E_g$ at $x=0$ and $u=0$ at $x=E_g/(qF)$.\n$$ \\int_{E_g}^0 \\sqrt{2m_r u} \\left(-\\frac{du}{qF}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m_r}}{qF} \\int_0^{E_g} u^{1/2} du = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m_r}}{qF} \\left[ \\frac{2}{3}u^{3/2} \\right]_0^{E_g} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3qF} $$\nSubstituting this back into the WKB formula, the transmission probability is:\n$$ \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{TFET}} = \\exp\\left(-2 \\times \\frac{2\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3qF\\hbar}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3q\\hbar F}\\right) $$\nFor low bias $V_{SD}$, the current is carried by electrons in the energy window of width $qV_{SD}$. Assuming the transmission probability is approximately constant over this small window, the TFET current is:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{TFET}} = \\frac{g_s q}{h} \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{TFET}} (qV_{SD}) = \\frac{2 q^2}{h} V_{SD} \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{TFET}} $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{TFET}} = \\frac{2 q^2}{h} V_{SD} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3q\\hbar F}\\right) $$\n\n**2. MOSFET Current ($I_{\\mathrm{MOS}}$)**\nFor the MOSFET, charge transport is dominated by thermionic emission over a barrier of height $E_b$ above the source Fermi level. The transmission can be modeled as a step function: $\\mathcal{T}(E) = 1$ for electrons with energy $E  E_b$ and $\\mathcal{T}(E) = 0$ for $E \\le E_b$, where energy is measured from the source Fermi level.\n\nThe problem states that injection is nondegenerate, so we use the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation for the Fermi-Dirac distribution: $f(E) \\approx \\exp(-E/k_B T)$, where $E$ is measured from the Fermi level.\nThe current is given by the general Landauer formula:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\frac{g_s q}{h} \\int_{E_b}^{\\infty} [f_S(E) - f_D(E)] dE $$\nUsing the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation for the distributions in the source and drain (with energies measured relative to their respective Fermi levels):\n$f_S(E) \\approx \\exp(-E/k_B T)$\n$f_D(E') \\approx \\exp(-E'/k_B T)$\nAn electron with energy $E$ in the source has energy $E' = E - qV_{SD}$ relative to the drain Fermi level. So, $f_D(E' = E-qV_{SD})$. This formulation is tricky. A more direct way is using the source Fermi level as a global reference ($E_{FS}=0$). Then $E_{FD}=-qV_{SD}$.\n$f_S(E) \\approx \\exp(-E/k_B T)$\n$f_D(E) \\approx \\exp(-(E-E_{FD})/k_B T) = \\exp(-(E+qV_{SD})/k_B T) = f_S(E)\\exp(-qV_{SD}/k_B T)$.\nThus, $f_S(E) - f_D(E) \\approx f_S(E) [1 - \\exp(-qV_{SD}/k_B T)]$.\nThe integral is:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\frac{g_s q}{h} [1 - \\exp(-qV_{SD}/k_B T)] \\int_{E_b}^{\\infty} \\exp(-E/k_B T) dE $$\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$$ \\int_{E_b}^{\\infty} \\exp(-E/k_B T) dE = [-k_B T \\exp(-E/k_B T)]_{E_b}^{\\infty} = k_B T \\exp(-E_b/k_B T) $$\nThus, the current is:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\frac{g_s q}{h} (k_B T \\exp(-E_b/k_B T)) [1 - \\exp(-qV_{SD}/k_B T)] $$\nFor small source-drain bias ($qV_{SD} \\ll k_B T$), we can approximate $1 - \\exp(-qV_{SD}/k_B T) \\approx 1 - (1 - qV_{SD}/k_B T) = qV_{SD}/k_B T$.\nSubstituting this approximation yields:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\frac{g_s q}{h} (k_B T \\exp(-E_b/k_B T)) \\left( \\frac{qV_{SD}}{k_B T} \\right) = \\frac{g_s q^2}{h} V_{SD} \\exp(-E_b/k_B T) $$\nWith $g_s=2$:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\frac{2 q^2}{h} V_{SD} \\exp(-E_b/k_B T) $$\nThis expression corresponds to a thermionic effective transmission probability of $\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\exp(-E_b/k_B T)$.\n\n**3. Ratio of Currents ($R$)**\nThe ratio $R$ is $I_{\\mathrm{TFET}}/I_{\\mathrm{MOS}}$. The prefactors $\\frac{2 q^2}{h} V_{SD}$ are identical and cancel out.\n$$ R = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{TFET}}}{I_{\\mathrm{MOS}}} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{4\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3q\\hbar F}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_b}{k_B T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_b}{k_B T} - \\frac{4\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3q\\hbar F}\\right) $$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nWe use the provided parameters and physical constants in SI units.\n- $E_g = 0.60 \\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.60 \\times (1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{J}) = 9.61308 \\times 10^{-20} \\,\\mathrm{J}$\n- $m_r = 0.050 \\, m_0 = 0.050 \\times (9.10938 \\times 10^{-31} \\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 4.55469 \\times 10^{-32} \\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $F = 3.0 \\times 10^{8} \\,\\mathrm{V/m}$\n- $E_b = 0.20 \\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.20 \\times (1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{J}) = 3.20436 \\times 10^{-20} \\,\\mathrm{J}$\n- $T = 300 \\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $q = 1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- $\\hbar = 1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s}$\n- $k_B = 1.38065 \\times 10^{-23} \\,\\mathrm{J/K}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term for the MOSFET exponent:\n$$ X_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\frac{E_b}{k_B T} = \\frac{3.20436 \\times 10^{-20} \\,\\mathrm{J}}{(1.38065 \\times 10^{-23} \\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (300 \\,\\mathrm{K})} \\approx 7.7371 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the term for the TFET exponent:\n$$ X_{\\mathrm{TFET}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3q\\hbar F} $$\nNumerator:\n$4\\sqrt{2(4.55469 \\times 10^{-32} \\,\\mathrm{kg})} \\times (9.61308 \\times 10^{-20} \\,\\mathrm{J})^{3/2}$\n$= 4 \\times (3.01817 \\times 10^{-16} \\,\\mathrm{kg}^{1/2}) \\times (2.9818 \\times 10^{-29} \\,\\mathrm{J}^{3/2}) \\approx 3.5986 \\times 10^{-44} \\,\\mathrm{J^2 s/m}$\nDenominator:\n$3(1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{C})(1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s})(3.0 \\times 10^{8} \\,\\mathrm{V/m})$\n$= 1.5202 \\times 10^{-44} \\,\\mathrm{J^2 s/m}$\n$$ X_{\\mathrm{TFET}} = \\frac{3.5986 \\times 10^{-44}}{1.5202 \\times 10^{-44}} \\approx 2.3672 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\exp(X_{\\mathrm{MOS}} - X_{\\mathrm{TFET}}) = \\exp(7.7371 - 2.3672) = \\exp(5.3699) \\approx 214.83 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $215$.",

The channel surface acts as a node in a small-signal capacitive circuit. This node is connected to the gate through the oxide capacitance $C_{\\text{ox}}$, to the body/source depletion region through the depletion capacitance $C_{\\text{dep}}$, and to the source/drain periphery through the fringing capacitance $C_{\\text{fringe}}$.

This will cause a corresponding small-signal change in the channel surface potential, $d \\psi_{s}$. According to the principle of charge conservation for an isolated node in an electrostatic system, the sum of the changes in charge stored on the capacitor plates connected to the channel node must be zero.

The reverse BTBT current, $I_{\\mathrm{rev}}(L_{\\mathrm{ov}})$, must not exceed the maximum allowable OFF-current, $I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}$.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{rev}}(L_{\\mathrm{ov}}) \\le I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}$$\nThe problem provides the following models:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{rev}}(L_{\\mathrm{ov}}) = I_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B}{F_{r}(L_{\\mathrm{ov}})}\\right)$$\n$$F_{r}(L_{\\mathrm{ov}}) = F_{r0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{r}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $F_{r}(L_{\\mathrm{ov}})$ into the expression for $I_{\\mathrm{rev}}(L_{\\mathrm{ov}})$, we get:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{rev}}(L_{\\mathrm{ov}}) = I_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B}{F_{r0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{r}}\\right)}\\right) = I_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B}{F_{r0}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{r}}\\right)\\right)$$\nNow, we apply the constraint:\n$$I_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B}{F_{r0}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{r}}\\right)\\right) \\le I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}$$\nTo solve for $L_{\\mathrm{ov}}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since $\\ln(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$\\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{B}{F_{r0}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{r}}\\right)\\right)\\right] \\le \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}}{I_{0}}\\right)$$\n$$-\\frac{B}{F_{r0}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{r}}\\right) \\le \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}}{I_{0}}\\right)$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality:\n$$\\frac{B}{F_{r0}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{r}}\\right) \\ge -\\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}}{I_{0}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}}{I_{0}}\\right)^{-1}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}}\\right)$$\nIsolating the exponential term:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{r}}\\right) \\ge \\frac{F_{r0}}{B} \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm again:\n$$\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{r}} \\ge \\ln\\left[\\frac{F_{r0}}{B} \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}}\\right)\\right]$$\nThis yields the first lower bound for $L_{\\mathrm{ov}}$, which we denote as $L_{\\mathrm{ov,1}}$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov}} \\ge \\lambda_{r} \\ln\\left[\\frac{F_{r0}}{B} \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{I_{\\mathrm{OFF}}}\\right)\\right] \\equiv L_{\\mathrm{ov,1}}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the second constraint, related to the ON-state performance. The forward tunneling field, $F_{f}(L_{\\mathrm{ov}})$, must be no less than a required field, $F_{\\mathrm{req}}$, to ensure sufficient ON-current.\n$$F_{f}(L_{\\mathrm{ov}}) \\ge F_{\\mathrm{req}}$$\nThe model for the forward field is given by:\n$$F_{f}(L_{\\mathrm{ov}}) = F_{f0} \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{f}}\\right)\\right]$$\nApplying the constraint:\n$$F_{f0} \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{f}}\\right)\\right] \\ge F_{\\mathrm{req}}$$\nWe solve for $L_{\\mathrm{ov}}$:\n$$1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{f}}\\right) \\ge \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{req}}}{F_{f0}}$$\n$$1 - \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{req}}}{F_{f0}} \\ge \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{f}}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides. Note that $F_{f0}  F_{\\mathrm{req}}$, so the argument of the logarithm is positive.\n$$\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{req}}}{F_{f0}}\\right) \\ge -\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{ov}}}{\\lambda_{f}}$$\nMultiplying by $-\\lambda_{f}$ reverses the inequality:\n$$-\\lambda_{f} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{req}}}{F_{f0}}\\right) \\le L_{\\mathrm{ov}}$$\nUsing the property $-\\ln(x) = \\ln(1/x)$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov}} \\ge \\lambda_{f} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{req}}}{F_{f0}}}\\right) = \\lambda_{f} \\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{f0}}{F_{f0} - F_{\\mathrm{req}}}\\right)$$\nThis gives the second lower bound for $L_{\\mathrm{ov}}$, denoted $L_{\\mathrm{ov,2}}$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov}} \\ge \\lambda_{f} \\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{f0}}{F_{f0} - F_{\\mathrm{req}}}\\right) \\equiv L_{\\mathrm{ov,2}}$$\n\nTo satisfy both constraints simultaneously, $L_{\\mathrm{ov}}$ must be greater than or equal to both $L_{\\mathrm{ov,1}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{ov,2}}$. Therefore, the minimal required overlap length is the maximum of these two lower bounds.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,min}} = \\max(L_{\\mathrm{ov,1}}, L_{\\mathrm{ov,2}})$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the expressions for $L_{\\mathrm{ov,1}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{ov,2}}$. The length scales $\\lambda_r$ and $\\lambda_f$ are given in units of nanometers ($nm$), so our results will also be in $nm$.\n\nFor $L_{\\mathrm{ov,1}}$:\n- $\\lambda_{r} = 6.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n- $F_{r0} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{V/cm}$\n- $B = 2.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{V/cm}$\n- $I_{0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{A}$\n- $I_{\\mathrm{OFF}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{A}$\n\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,1}} = (6.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\times \\ln\\left[\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{6}}{2.0 \\times 10^{7}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}}\\right)\\right]$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,1}} = (6.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\times \\ln\\left[0.1 \\times \\ln(10^{8})\\right]$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,1}} = (6.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\times \\ln[0.1 \\times 8 \\ln(10)]$$\nUsing $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.30259$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,1}} \\approx (6.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\times \\ln[0.1 \\times 8 \\times 2.30259] = (6.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\times \\ln(1.84207)$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,1}} \\approx (6.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\times 0.61085 \\approx 3.6651\\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\n\nFor $L_{\\mathrm{ov,2}}$:\n- $\\lambda_{f} = 4.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n- $F_{f0} = 3.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{V/cm}$\n- $F_{\\mathrm{req}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{V/cm}$\n\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,2}} = (4.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{6}}{3.0 \\times 10^{6} - 1.5 \\times 10^{6}}\\right)$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,2}} = (4.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{6}}{1.5 \\times 10^{6}}\\right)$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,2}} = (4.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\times \\ln(2)$$\nUsing $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69315$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,2}} \\approx (4.0\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\times 0.69315 \\approx 2.7726\\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\n\nComparing the two lower bounds:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,1}} \\approx 3.6651\\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,2}} \\approx 2.7726\\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\nThe minimal overlap length is the maximum of these two values:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,min}} = \\max(3.6651\\ \\mathrm{nm}, 2.7726\\ \\mathrm{nm}) = 3.6651\\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\nThe OFF-state leakage current constraint is the more stringent one, determining the minimum overlap length.\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{ov,min}} \\approx 3.67\\ \\mathrm{nm}$$",
