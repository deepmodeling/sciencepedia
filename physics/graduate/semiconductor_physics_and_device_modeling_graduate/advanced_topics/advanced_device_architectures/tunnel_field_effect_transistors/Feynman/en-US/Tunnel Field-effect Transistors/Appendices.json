The transmission probability across this barrier is to be estimated using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. Assume the tunneling proceeds between a valence-band initial state and a conduction-band final state with an effective reduced mass $m_r$. The device is biased at a small source-drain voltage $V_{SD}$, and charge transport is ballistic and governed by the Landauer formalism with spin degeneracy $g_s = 2$. \n\nAn equivalent single-mode ballistic Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) at the same gate overdrive is characterized by a source-to-channel thermionic barrier of height $E_b$ (above the source Fermi level) and the same $V_{SD}$. Assume nondegenerate injection so that the thermionic occupation of carriers able to surmount the barrier is controlled by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics at temperature $T$. Use the Landauer formalism to estimate the low-bias current as the product of the low-bias conductance and $V_{SD}$, with the conductance determined by the transmission and the occupancy of available states.\n\nStarting from first principles — the Landauer current expression and the WKB transmission through a triangular barrier — derive analytic expressions for the TFET ON current and the MOSFET thermionic current under the stated assumptions.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the ratio of the ON-state current of a Tunnel Field-Effect Transistor (TFET) to the thermionic current of a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) under specific simplifying assumptions. Both currents are to be modeled using the Landauer formalism in the low-bias, single-mode, ballistic transport regime.\n\nFirst, we establish the general framework. The Landauer formula for current through a single-mode one-dimensional channel is given by:\n$$ I = \\frac{g_s q}{h} \\int \\mathcal{T}(E) [f_S(E) - f_D(E)] dE $$\nwhere $g_s$ is the spin degeneracy (given as $g_s=2$), $q$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is Planck's constant, $\\mathcal{T}(E)$ is the transmission probability at energy $E$, and $f_S(E)$ and $f_D(E)$ are the Fermi-Dirac distributions for the source and drain, respectively.\n\nFor a small source-drain voltage $V_{SD}$, the difference in Fermi levels is $E_{FS} - E_{FD} = q V_{SD}$. The difference in Fermi functions can be approximated as:\n$$ f_S(E) - f_D(E) \\approx -\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E} (E_{FS} - E_{FD}) = -\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E} q V_{SD} $$\nThis leads to the low-bias current expression $I = G V_{SD}$, where the conductance $G$ is:\n$$ G = \\frac{g_s q^2}{h} \\int \\mathcal{T}(E) \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E}\\right) dE $$\nHowever, the physical mechanisms governing transmission $\\mathcal{T}(E)$ and the relevant energy ranges are different for the TFET and the MOSFET. The problem statement guides the use of a simplified low-bias model where $I = G V_{SD}$.\n\n**1. TFET Current ($I_{\\mathrm{TFET}}$)**\nFor the TFET, the current is due to band-to-band tunneling (BTBT). The problem specifies modeling this with the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation for a triangular potential barrier. The barrier has a height equal to the bandgap $E_g$ and is created by a uniform electric field $F$.\n\nThe WKB transmission probability $\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E)$ for a particle of mass $m_r$ tunneling through a potential barrier $V(x)$ is:\n$$ \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E) \\approx \\exp\\left(-2 \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\frac{\\sqrt{2m_r(V(x)-E)}}{\\hbar} dx\\right) $$\nwhere $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the classical turning points. For a triangular barrier of height $E_g$ and slope $qF$, the potential is $V(x) = E_g - qFx$ for $x>0$. We consider an electron tunneling at the valence band edge, for which the energy can be set to $E=0$. The turning points are $x_1=0$ and $x_2$, where $V(x_2)=0$, which yields $x_2 = E_g / (qF)$.\n\nThe integral in the exponent is:\n$$ \\int_0^{E_g/(qF)} \\sqrt{2m_r(E_g - qFx)} dx $$\nLet $u = E_g - qFx$, so $du = -qF dx$. The limits of integration become $u=E_g$ at $x=0$ and $u=0$ at $x=E_g/(qF)$.\n$$ \\int_{E_g}^0 \\sqrt{2m_r u} \\left(-\\frac{du}{qF}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m_r}}{qF} \\int_0^{E_g} u^{1/2} du = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m_r}}{qF} \\left[ \\frac{2}{3}u^{3/2} \\right]_0^{E_g} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3qF} $$\nSubstituting this back into the WKB formula, the transmission probability is:\n$$ \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{TFET}} = \\exp\\left(-2 \\times \\frac{2\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3qF\\hbar}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3q\\hbar F}\\right) $$\nFor low bias $V_{SD}$, the current is carried by electrons in the energy window of width $qV_{SD}$. Assuming the transmission probability is approximately constant over this small window, the TFET current is:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{TFET}} = \\frac{g_s q}{h} \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{TFET}} (qV_{SD}) = \\frac{2 q^2}{h} V_{SD} \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{TFET}} $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{TFET}} = \\frac{2 q^2}{h} V_{SD} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3q\\hbar F}\\right) $$\n\n**2. MOSFET Current ($I_{\\mathrm{MOS}}$)**\nFor the MOSFET, charge transport is dominated by thermionic emission over a barrier of height $E_b$ above the source Fermi level. The transmission can be modeled as a step function: $\\mathcal{T}(E) = 1$ for electrons with energy $E > E_b$ and $\\mathcal{T}(E) = 0$ for $E \\le E_b$, where energy is measured from the source Fermi level.\n\nThe problem states that injection is nondegenerate, so we use the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation for the Fermi-Dirac distribution: $f(E) \\approx \\exp(-E/k_B T)$, where $E$ is measured from the Fermi level.\nThe current is given by the general Landauer formula:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\frac{g_s q}{h} \\int_{E_b}^{\\infty} [f_S(E) - f_D(E)] dE $$\nUsing the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation for the distributions in the source and drain (with energies measured relative to their respective Fermi levels):\n$f_S(E) \\approx \\exp(-E/k_B T)$\n$f_D(E') \\approx \\exp(-E'/k_B T)$\nAn electron with energy $E$ in the source has energy $E' = E - qV_{SD}$ relative to the drain Fermi level. So, $f_D(E' = E-qV_{SD})$. This formulation is tricky. A more direct way is using the source Fermi level as a global reference ($E_{FS}=0$). Then $E_{FD}=-qV_{SD}$.\n$f_S(E) \\approx \\exp(-E/k_B T)$\n$f_D(E) \\approx \\exp(-(E-E_{FD})/k_B T) = \\exp(-(E+qV_{SD})/k_B T) = f_S(E)\\exp(-qV_{SD}/k_B T)$.\nThus, $f_S(E) - f_D(E) \\approx f_S(E) [1 - \\exp(-qV_{SD}/k_B T)]$.\nThe integral is:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\frac{g_s q}{h} [1 - \\exp(-qV_{SD}/k_B T)] \\int_{E_b}^{\\infty} \\exp(-E/k_B T) dE $$\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$$ \\int_{E_b}^{\\infty} \\exp(-E/k_B T) dE = [-k_B T \\exp(-E/k_B T)]_{E_b}^{\\infty} = k_B T \\exp(-E_b/k_B T) $$\nThus, the current is:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\frac{g_s q}{h} (k_B T \\exp(-E_b/k_B T)) [1 - \\exp(-qV_{SD}/k_B T)] $$\nFor small source-drain bias ($qV_{SD} \\ll k_B T$), we can approximate $1 - \\exp(-qV_{SD}/k_B T) \\approx 1 - (1 - qV_{SD}/k_B T) = qV_{SD}/k_B T$.\nSubstituting this approximation yields:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\frac{g_s q}{h} (k_B T \\exp(-E_b/k_B T)) \\left( \\frac{qV_{SD}}{k_B T} \\right) = \\frac{g_s q^2}{h} V_{SD} \\exp(-E_b/k_B T) $$\nWith $g_s=2$:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\frac{2 q^2}{h} V_{SD} \\exp(-E_b/k_B T) $$\nThis expression corresponds to a thermionic effective transmission probability of $\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\exp(-E_b/k_B T)$.\n\n**3. Ratio of Currents ($R$)**\nThe ratio $R$ is $I_{\\mathrm{TFET}}/I_{\\mathrm{MOS}}$. The prefactors $\\frac{2 q^2}{h} V_{SD}$ are identical and cancel out.\n$$ R = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{TFET}}}{I_{\\mathrm{MOS}}} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{4\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3q\\hbar F}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_b}{k_B T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_b}{k_B T} - \\frac{4\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3q\\hbar F}\\right) $$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nWe use the provided parameters and physical constants in SI units.\n- $E_g = 0.60 \\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.60 \\times (1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{J}) = 9.61308 \\times 10^{-20} \\,\\mathrm{J}$\n- $m_r = 0.050 \\, m_0 = 0.050 \\times (9.10938 \\times 10^{-31} \\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 4.55469 \\times 10^{-32} \\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $F = 3.0 \\times 10^{8} \\,\\mathrm{V/m}$\n- $E_b = 0.20 \\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.20 \\times (1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{J}) = 3.20436 \\times 10^{-20} \\,\\mathrm{J}$\n- $T = 300 \\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $q = 1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- $\\hbar = 1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s}$\n- $k_B = 1.38065 \\times 10^{-23} \\,\\mathrm{J/K}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term for the MOSFET exponent:\n$$ X_{\\mathrm{MOS}} = \\frac{E_b}{k_B T} = \\frac{3.20436 \\times 10^{-20} \\,\\mathrm{J}}{(1.38065 \\times 10^{-23} \\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (300 \\,\\mathrm{K})} \\approx 7.7371 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the term for the TFET exponent:\n$$ X_{\\mathrm{TFET}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2m_r}E_g^{3/2}}{3q\\hbar F} $$\nNumerator:\n$4\\sqrt{2(4.55469 \\times 10^{-32} \\,\\mathrm{kg})} \\times (9.61308 \\times 10^{-20} \\,\\mathrm{J})^{3/2}$\n$= 4 \\times (3.01817 \\times 10^{-16} \\,\\mathrm{kg}^{1/2}) \\times (2.9818 \\times 10^{-29} \\,\\mathrm{J}^{3/2}) \\approx 3.5986 \\times 10^{-44} \\,\\mathrm{J^2 s/m}$\nDenominator:\n$3(1.60218 \\times 10^{-19} \\,\\mathrm{C})(1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s})(3.0 \\times 10^{8} \\,\\mathrm{V/m})$\n$= 1.5202 \\times 10^{-44} \\,\\mathrm{J^2 s/m}$\n$$ X_{\\mathrm{TFET}} = \\frac{3.5986 \\times 10^{-44}}{1.5202 \\times 10^{-44}} \\approx 2.3672 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\exp(X_{\\mathrm{MOS}} - X_{\\mathrm{TFET}}) = \\exp(7.7371 - 2.3672) = \\exp(5.3699) \\approx 214.83 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $215$.",

The derivation will be based on the principle of small-signal charge conservation at the channel surface node, within the provided capacitive network model.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the planar single-gate (SG) device. The channel surface acts as a node in a small-signal capacitive circuit. This node is connected to the gate through the oxide capacitance $C_{\\text{ox}}$, to the body/source depletion region through the depletion capacitance $C_{\\text{dep}}$, and to the source/drain periphery through the fringing capacitance $C_{\\text{fringe}}$.

This will cause a corresponding small-signal change in the channel surface potential, $d \\psi_{s}$. According to the principle of charge conservation for an isolated node in an electrostatic system, the sum of the changes in charge stored on the capacitor plates connected to the channel node must be zero.

Use the following physical models and definitions:\n\n- The retarded Green’s function for energy $E$ is $G^r(E) = \\left[(E + i0^+)I - H - \\Sigma_S - \\Sigma_D\\right]^{-1}$, where $\\Sigma_S = -i \\Gamma_S/2$ and $\\Sigma_D = -i \\Gamma_D/2$ are diagonal self-energies at the first and last site, respectively.\n- The transmission at energy $E$ is $T(E) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[\\Gamma_S G^r(E) \\Gamma_D G^a(E)\\right]$, which reduces to $T(E) = \\Gamma_S \\Gamma_D \\left|G^r_{1N}(E)\\right|^2$ for a single-mode chain with contact couplings only at the ends.\n- The Landauer current is $I(V_g) = \\dfrac{2 q}{h} \\int dE\\, T(E;V_g)\\left[f_S(E) - f_D(E)\\right]$, where $q$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is Planck’s constant, and $f_{S,D}(E) = \\left[1 + \\exp\\left(\\dfrac{E - \\mu_{S,D}}{k_B T}\\right)\\right]^{-1}$ are the Fermi-Dirac distributions at the source and drain, with chemical potentials $\\mu_S$ and $\\mu_D$.\n- The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) tunneling transmission through the barrier is approximated by $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E;V_g) = \\exp\\left(-2 \\int \\kappa(x,E;V_g)\\, dx\\right)$, where $\\kappa(x,E;V_g) = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2 m^\\ast \\left[U(x;V_g) - E\\right]_+}{\\hbar^2}}$, with $[X]_+ = \\max(X,0)$.\n\nThe device and simulation parameters are:\n- Effective mass: $m^\\ast = 0.05\\, m_0$, where $m_0$ is the electron rest mass.\n- Lattice spacing: $a = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- Number of sites: $N = 101$.\n- Barrier region indices: $i_0 = 30$, $i_1 = 70$ (inclusive), with a triangular barrier shape $U_i(V_g) = U_b(V_g)\\left(1 - \\dfrac{i - i_0}{i_1 - i_0}\\right)$ for $i \\in [i_0,i_1]$ and $U_i(V_g) = 0$ otherwise, with $U_b(V_g) = \\max\\left(0, E_g - \\alpha V_g\\right)$.\n- Bandgap-like energy scale: $E_g = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- Gate-to-barrier coupling factor: $\\alpha = 0.8$ (dimensionless).\n- Contact broadenings: $\\Gamma_S = \\Gamma_D = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- Drain bias: $V_d = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{V}$, with $\\mu_S = 0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\mu_D = -V_d\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- Temperature: $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Energy integration range and resolution: integrate $E \\in [E_{\\min}, E_{\\max}]$ with $E_{\\min} = -0.3\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $E_{\\max} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, using a uniform grid of $N_E = 501$ points.\n\nImplement the NEGF transmission $T(E;V_g)$ using a numerically stable tridiagonal solver to compute the $(1,N)$ element of the retarded Green’s function $G^r_{1N}(E)$ for each energy $E$. Compute the WKB transmission $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E;V_g)$ by numerically integrating $\\kappa(x,E;V_g)$ over the device length using the trapezoidal rule. Compute currents $I_{\\mathrm{NEGF}}(V_g)$ and $I_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(V_g)$ via the Landauer formula, using numerical integration over energy with the trapezoidal rule. Express all computed currents in Ampere ($\\mathrm{A}$).\n\nTest Suite:\nEvaluate the program for the following gate voltages:\n- $V_g = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{V}$,\n- $V_g = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$,\n- $V_g = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{V}$,\n- $V_g = 0.62\\,\\mathrm{V}$,\n- $V_g = 0.7\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\nThese cases span a low-tunneling regime, intermediate gate strengths, near-barrier-closure $V_g \\approx E_g/\\alpha$, and a high-gate regime where the barrier is clamped at zero height.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing a comma-separated list of five pairs, each pair being the two currents for a given gate voltage in Ampere, ordered as $\\left[I_{\\mathrm{NEGF}}(V_g), I_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(V_g)\\right]$ for the five gate voltages in the order listed above. The format must be a single Python list of lists, for example, $\\left[ [I_{\\mathrm{NEGF}}(0.0), I_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(0.0)], [I_{\\mathrm{NEGF}}(0.2), I_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(0.2)], \\ldots \\right]$, printed as a single line, with all values as decimal floats in $\\mathrm{A}$.",
            "solution": "The user has provided a well-defined and scientifically sound problem. The task is to compute and compare the current-voltage characteristics of a one-dimensional Tunnel Field-Effect Transistor (TFET) using two distinct physical models: the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. All required physical parameters, mathematical equations, and numerical procedures are specified, rendering the problem valid and solvable.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first establishing a consistent system of units and defining all parameters. Then, for each specified gate voltage $V_g$, the potential profile $U_i(V_g)$ is constructed. Subsequently, the energy-dependent transmission functions, $T_{\\mathrm{NEGF}}(E; V_g)$ and $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E; V_g)$, are calculated over a specified energy grid. Finally, the Landauer formula is used to compute the currents, $I_{\\mathrm{NEGF}}(V_g)$ and $I_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(V_g)$, by numerically integrating the product of the transmission and the difference in Fermi-Dirac distributions of the source and drain contacts.\n\n**1. Constants and Parameters**\n\nAll calculations will be performed in the International System of Units (SI). The provided parameters are converted accordingly.\n- Elementary charge: $q \\approx 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$.\n- Planck's constant: $h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Reduced Planck's constant: $\\hbar = h/(2\\pi) \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Electron rest mass: $m_0 \\approx 9.109 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Boltzmann constant: $k_B \\approx 1.380 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Effective mass: $m^\\ast = 0.05 \\cdot m_0$.\n- Lattice spacing: $a = 0.25 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Number of sites: $N = 101$.\n- Barrier region indices: $i_0 = 30$, $i_1 = 70$.\n- Bandgap energy scale: $E_g = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.5 \\cdot q\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\n- Gate coupling factor: $\\alpha = 0.8$.\n- Contact broadenings: $\\Gamma_S = \\Gamma_D = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.02 \\cdot q\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\n- Drain bias: $V_d = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n- Chemical potentials: $\\mu_S = 0\\,\\mathrm{J}$, $\\mu_D = -0.05\\,\\mathrm{eV} = -0.05 \\cdot q\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\n- Temperature: $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Energy grid: $N_E = 501$ points from $E_{\\min} = -0.3\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ to $E_{\\max} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- The hopping parameter is calculated as $t = \\hbar^2 / (2m^\\ast a^2)$.\n\n**2. Potential Profile Construction**\n\nFor each gate voltage $V_g$, a one-dimensional potential array $U$ of size $N$ is constructed. First, the gate-voltage-dependent barrier height $U_b(V_g)$ is determined:\n$$\nU_b(V_g) = \\max(0, E_g - \\alpha V_g)\n$$\nThe potential profile $U_i$ at each site $i$ (using 0-based indexing, $i = 0, \\dots, N-1$) is then defined by a triangular shape over the specified barrier region:\n$$\nU_i(V_g) = \\begin{cases} U_b(V_g)\\left(1 - \\dfrac{i - i_0}{i_1 - i_0}\\right) & \\text{for } i \\in [i_0, i_1] \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**3. NEGF Transmission Calculation**\n\nThe transmission probability $T_{\\mathrm{NEGF}}(E)$ is computed using the NEGF method. The retarded Green's function $G^r(E)$ is the inverse of the matrix $M(E)$:\n$$\nG^r(E) = M(E)^{-1} = \\left[ E \\cdot I - H - \\Sigma_S - \\Sigma_D \\right]^{-1}\n$$\nHere, $H$ is the Hamiltonian matrix, and $\\Sigma_{S,D}$ are the contact self-energy matrices. The matrix $M(E)$ is a complex-valued tridiagonal matrix. Its elements are (using 0-based indexing):\n- Main diagonal elements, $M_{ii}$:\n$$\nM_{ii}(E) = \\begin{cases} E - (U_0 + 2t) + i\\Gamma_S/2 & \\text{for } i=0 \\\\ E - (U_{N-1} + 2t) + i\\Gamma_D/2 & \\text{for } i=N-1 \\\\ E - (U_i + 2t) & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\n- Off-diagonal elements, $M_{i,j}$ for $|i-j|=1$:\n$$\nM_{i,i\\pm 1}(E) = -(-t) = t\n$$\nThe sign of the off-diagonal element results from the definition $M(E) = E \\cdot I - H$, where the Hamiltonian $H$ has nearest-neighbor couplings of $-t$.\n\nThe transmission for a single-mode chain with contacts at the ends is given by:\n$$\nT(E) = \\Gamma_S \\Gamma_D \\left|G^r_{0,N-1}(E)\\right|^2\n$$\nwhere $G^r_{0,N-1}(E)$ is the element of the Green's function connecting the first and last sites. This element is computed by solving the linear system $M(E) \\cdot \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{b}$ is a column vector with a $1$ at the last position and $0$ elsewhere. The first element of the solution vector, $x_0$, is the desired Green's function element, $G^r_{0,N-1}(E)$. A numerically stable banded matrix solver is used for this computation.\n\n**4. WKB Transmission Calculation**\n\nThe WKB approximation provides a semi-classical estimate for the tunneling probability. The transmission $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E)$ is given by:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E;V_g) = \\exp\\left(-2 \\int_0^L \\kappa(x,E;V_g)\\, dx\\right)\n$$\nThe wave-vector in the classically forbidden region, $\\kappa(x,E)$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\kappa(x,E;V_g) = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2 m^\\ast \\left[U(x;V_g) - E\\right]_+}{\\hbar^2}}\n$$\nwhere $[X]_+ = \\max(X,0)$. The integral is performed numerically over the device length $L = (N-1)a$ using the trapezoidal rule, with the discrete potential values $U_i$ defined at positions $x_i = i \\cdot a$.\n\n**5. Current Calculation**\n\nBoth $T_{\\mathrm{NEGF}}(E)$ and $T_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(E)$ are used in the Landauer formula to calculate the current $I$:\n$$\nI(V_g) = \\frac{2q}{h} \\int_{E_{\\min}}^{E_{\\max}} T(E; V_g) \\left[ f_S(E) - f_D(E) \\right] dE\n$$\nwhere $f_S(E)$ and $f_D(E)$ are the Fermi-Dirac distributions for the source and drain contacts:\n$$\nf_{S,D}(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E - \\mu_{S,D}}{k_B T}\\right)}\n$$\nThe integral over energy is computed numerically using the trapezoidal rule over the defined energy grid. This procedure yields the currents $I_{\\mathrm{NEGF}}(V_g)$ and $I_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(V_g)$ for each gate voltage. The final results are presented as pairs for each tested $V_g$.",
