            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the quantum capacitance per unit area for a two-dimensional electron gas ($2$DEG) and its comparison to a given oxide capacitance.\n\nThe quantum capacitance, $C_q$, arises from the finite density of electronic states, which requires an energy change to accommodate additional charge carriers. It is defined by the change in charge $Q$ with respect to the change in the electrochemical potential $\\mu$ of the system. A robust definition, which avoids sign ambiguities related to electrostatic potential conventions, is based on the thermodynamic potential:\n$$C_q = \\frac{d(q N)}{d(\\mu/q)} = q^2 \\frac{dN}{d\\mu}$$\nwhere $N$ is the total number of electrons and $q$ is the elementary charge. The quantum capacitance per unit area, $C_q/A$, which we denote as $c_q$, is therefore:\n$$c_q = \\frac{C_q}{A} = q^2 \\frac{d(N/A)}{d\\mu} = q^2 \\frac{dn_s}{d\\mu}$$\nwhere $n_s$ is the sheet carrier density (number of electrons per unit area).\n\nAt zero temperature ($T=0$), the electrochemical potential $\\mu$ is equal to the Fermi energy, $E_F$. The term $\\frac{dn_s}{dE_F}$ is, by definition, the electronic density of states per unit area at the Fermi energy, which the problem provides as $D(E_F)$. Therefore, the quantum capacitance per unit area at $T=0$ is given by:\n$$c_q = q^2 D(E_F)$$\nThe problem states that for a $2$DEG with a single parabolic band, the density of states (including spin degeneracy) is constant and given by:\n$$D(E_F) = \\frac{m^{*}}{\\pi \\hbar^2}$$\nwhere $m^*$ is the effective mass and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nSubstituting this expression for the density of states into the equation for $c_q$, we obtain the final analytical expression for the quantum capacitance per unit area:\n$$c_q = \\frac{C_q}{A} = \\frac{q^2 m^{*}}{\\pi \\hbar^2}$$\nThis expression is independent of the Fermi energy, a characteristic feature of a $2$DEG with a parabolic band structure.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically.

A standard linearization about the operating point yields an electrostatic term\n$$\ndV_{\\text{centroid}}=\\frac{x_c}{\\epsilon_{si}}\\, dQ_{\\text{inv}},\n$$\nwhich can be seen by writing the electrostatic drop as $\\int_0^{\\infty} E(x)\\, dx$ and linearizing the first moment of the charge distribution with respect to $Q_{\\text{inv}}$ using Gauss’s law.\n\n- A thermodynamic drop due to the finite electronic compressibility of the inversion layer, often represented by a quantum capacitance $C_q$ such that\n$$\ndV_{\\text{quantum}}=\\frac{dQ_{\\text{inv}}}{C_q}.\n$$\nFor a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in silicon inversion layers, $C_q$ arises from the two-dimensional density of states of occupied subbands and can be computed from a self-consistent Schrödinger–Poisson solution.\n\nThus,\n$$\ndV_{inv}=dV_{\\text{centroid}}+dV_{\\text{quantum}}=\\left(\\frac{x_c}{\\epsilon_{si}}+\\frac{1}{C_q}\\right)dQ_{\\text{inv}}.\n$$\n\nIn a split capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurement, the measured gate-to-channel capacitance per unit area is by definition\n$$\nC_{gc}=\\left(\\frac{\\partial Q_{\\text{inv}}}{\\partial V_g}\\right)_{V_{\\text{sub}}}.\n$$\nCombining the incremental voltage partition yields\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V_g}{\\partial Q_{\\text{inv}}}=\\frac{1}{C_{ox}}+\\frac{1}{C_{pd}}+\\frac{x_c}{\\epsilon_{si}}+\\frac{1}{C_q},\n$$\nso that\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_{gc}}=\\frac{1}{C_{ox}}+\\frac{1}{C_{pd}}+\\frac{x_c}{\\epsilon_{si}}+\\frac{1}{C_q}.\n$$\nSolving for the centroid gives the extraction formula\n$$\nx_c=\\epsilon_{si}\\left(\\frac{1}{C_{gc}}-\\frac{1}{C_{ox}}-\\frac{1}{C_{pd}}-\\frac{1}{C_q}\\right).\n$$\n\nCrucially, in a split C–V configuration the substrate depletion branch does not contribute to $C_{gc}$ because displacement currents associated with the depletion region terminate at the substrate contact, not at source/drain. Therefore, no depletion capacitance of the bulk silicon appears in series in the $C_{gc}$ path.\n\nFrom an experimental perspective, the quantities required are:\n- $C_{gc}(V_g)$ from a low-frequency split C–V measurement.\n- $C_{ox}$ from accumulation on a reference capacitor with the same dielectric stack, or from independent thickness and permittivity measurements.\n- $C_{pd}(V_g)$ under inversion, which can be obtained by comparing a polysilicon-gate device to an otherwise identical metal-gate reference, since\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_{gc,\\text{poly}}}=\\frac{1}{C_{ox}}+\\frac{1}{C_{pd}}+\\frac{x_c}{\\epsilon_{si}}+\\frac{1}{C_q},\\quad\n\\frac{1}{C_{gc,\\text{metal}}}=\\frac{1}{C_{ox}}+\\frac{x_c}{\\epsilon_{si}}+\\frac{1}{C_q},\n$$\nimplying\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_{pd}}=\\frac{1}{C_{gc,\\text{poly}}}-\\frac{1}{C_{gc,\\text{metal}}}.\n$$\nAlternatively, $C_{pd}$ can be computed from the depletion width in polysilicon via Poisson’s equation using the known doping and bias.\n- $C_q(V_g)$ from theory at the measured temperature and inversion density. A self-consistent Schrödinger–Poisson solution provides subband energies $E_n$, wavefunctions $\\psi_n(x)$, and sheet densities $n_n$, from which\n$$\nC_q=q^2\\sum_n \\frac{\\partial n_n}{\\partial \\mu},\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the electrochemical potential along the channel. In the nondegenerate limit for a single occupied subband of effective mass $m^*$, $C_q\\approx q^2 g_{2D}$ with $g_{2D}=g_v g_s m^*/(\\pi \\hbar^2)$, where $g_v$ and $g_s$ are valley and spin degeneracies.\n\nWith $C_{gc}$, $C_{ox}$, $C_{pd}$, and $C_q$ known, $x_c(V_g)$ follows from the above expression. Theoretical predictions for $x_c(V_g)$ are obtained from the same Schrödinger–Poisson solution via\n$$\nx_c^{\\text{th}}(V_g)=\\frac{\\sum_n \\int_0^{\\infty} x\\, |\\psi_n(x;V_g)|^2\\, n_n(V_g)\\, dx}{\\sum_n \\int_0^{\\infty} |\\psi_n(x;V_g)|^2\\, n_n(V_g)\\, dx},\n$$\nwhich can be directly compared to the experimentally extracted $x_c(V_g)$ to assess the roles of quantum confinement and polysilicon depletion.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\n- Option A: This proposes split C–V to obtain $C_{gc}$, an independent measurement of $C_{ox}$, an extraction or independent computation of $C_{pd}$, and a theoretical determination of $C_q$, followed by\n$$\nx_c=\\epsilon_{si}\\left(\\frac{1}{C_{gc}}-\\frac{1}{C_{ox}}-\\frac{1}{C_{pd}}-\\frac{1}{C_q}\\right),\n$$\nand comparison to a Schrödinger–Poisson centroid. This matches the derived relation and respects the measurement topology of split C–V. Verdict — Correct.\n\n- Option B: This uses a high-frequency MOS capacitor $C_{\\text{tot}}$ in inversion and assumes only oxide and depletion capacitances, then uses\n$$\nx_c=\\epsilon_{ox}\\left(\\frac{1}{C_{\\text{tot}}}-\\frac{1}{C_{ox}}\\right).\n$$\nThis is incorrect for multiple reasons: high-frequency inversion charge does not respond in standard MOS capacitor measurements, the depletion branch is not part of split $C_{gc}$, polysilicon depletion and quantum capacitance are neglected, and the permittivity factor should be $\\epsilon_{si}$, not $\\epsilon_{ox}$, for the centroid electrostatic drop. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: This uses split C–V but neglects both polysilicon depletion and quantum capacitance,\n$$\nx_c=\\epsilon_{si}\\left(\\frac{1}{C_{gc}}-\\frac{1}{C_{ox}}\\right).\n$$\nWhile this form superficially resembles part of the correct expression, it systematically overestimates $x_c$ by attributing series drops from $C_{pd}$ and $C_q$ to the centroid. It is not a correct extraction method when polysilicon depletion and finite compressibility are present. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: This posits a parallel-capacitance model $C_{gc}(V_g)=C_{ox}+C_q(V_g)+C_{pd}(V_g)$ and equates $x_c$ to $\\epsilon_{si}/C_q(V_g)$. The gate-to-channel path is a series chain of drops for small-signal charging, not a parallel addition; moreover, the centroid and quantum contributions add as series drops within the inversion layer, so $C_q$ cannot be equated to the centroid effect. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option E: This extracts $x_c$ from transconductance via $g_m=\\mu C_{\\text{tot}} W/L\\, V_{ds}$. This approach conflates transport (mobility $\\mu$ and series resistances) with electrostatics, and $C_{\\text{tot}}$ in transconductance measurements includes additional series/parallel components and bias-dependent charge partitioning along the channel. It does not isolate the gate-to-channel small-signal path measured by split C–V, and it neglects $C_{pd}$ and $C_q$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only Option A presents a correct and complete experimental method with the proper analysis and comparison to theory.",
