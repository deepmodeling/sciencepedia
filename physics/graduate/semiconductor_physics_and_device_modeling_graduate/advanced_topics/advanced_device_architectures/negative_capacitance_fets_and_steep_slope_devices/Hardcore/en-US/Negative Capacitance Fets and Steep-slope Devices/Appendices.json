            "problem": "A Negative Capacitance Field-Effect Transistor (NC-FET) integrates a ferroelectric layer in series with the linear capacitances of the gate stack. At a chosen operating point, the ferroelectric exhibits a negative small-signal differential capacitance per unit area and the linear oxide is approximated by a constant positive capacitance per unit area. Assume quasi-static operation and one-dimensional charge flow normal to the interface so that series elements share the same incremental charge.

Express the effective capacitance as an exact value in $\\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2}$ (no rounding required).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the stability criterion and the effective small-signal capacitance for a series combination of a linear capacitor and a ferroelectric capacitor, followed by a numerical evaluation.\n\nLet $C_{s}$ be the capacitance per unit area of the linear dielectric layer, with $C_{s} > 0$. Let $C_{\\text{FE}}$ be the small-signal differential capacitance per unit area of the ferroelectric layer, which at the given operating point is negative, so $C_{\\text{FE}}  0$. The two capacitive elements are connected in series, which means they share the same charge per unit area, $Q$, and a small perturbation in charge, $\\mathrm{d}Q$, is common to both.\n\nFirst, we derive the stability criterion. The problem states that for a stable equilibrium, the total free-energy curvature with respect to the shared series charge must be positive. The total free energy of the system, $U_{total}$, is the sum of the free energies of its components, the linear capacitor ($U_{s}$) and the ferroelectric layer ($U_{\\text{FE}}$).\n$$U_{total}(Q) = U_{s}(Q) + U_{\\text{FE}}(Q)$$\nThe stability criterion is therefore expressed as:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}U_{total}}{\\mathrm{d}Q^{2}} > 0$$\nUsing the additive property of the energies, the second derivative is:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}U_{total}}{\\mathrm{d}Q^{2}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}U_{s}}{\\mathrm{d}Q^{2}} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}U_{\\text{FE}}}{\\mathrm{d}Q^{2}}$$\nThe problem provides the relationship between energy curvature and capacitance, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}U}{\\mathrm{d}Q^{2}} = \\frac{1}{C}$. This relationship is derived from the general definition of capacitor energy $U(Q) = \\int V(Q') \\mathrm{d}Q'$, where $V$ is the voltage. The first derivative is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}Q} = V(Q)$, and the second derivative is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}U}{\\mathrm{d}Q^{2}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}Q}$. By the definition of differential capacitance, $C = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}V}$, it follows that $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}U}{\\mathrm{d}Q^{2}} = \\frac{1}{C}$. This holds for both the linear capacitor and the ferroelectric layer (using its differential capacitance).\n\nFor the linear capacitor, the energy curvature is $\\frac{1}{C_{s}}$. For the ferroelectric layer, the contribution to the free-energy curvature is $\\frac{1}{C_{\\text{FE}}}$.\nSubstituting these into the stability inequality, we obtain the small-signal stability criterion:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_{s}} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{FE}}} > 0$$\nSince $C_{\\text{FE}}$ is negative, let $C_{\\text{FE}} = -|C_{\\text{FE}}|$. The criterion becomes $\\frac{1}{C_{s}} - \\frac{1}{|C_{\\text{FE}}|} > 0$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{C_{s}} > \\frac{1}{|C_{\\text{FE}}|}$, or $|C_{\\text{FE}}| > C_{s}$. For the series combination to be stable, the magnitude of the negative ferroelectric capacitance must exceed the positive linear capacitance.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the effective small-signal capacitance, $C_{\\text{eff}}$. For two capacitors in series, the total voltage drop, $V_{total}$, is the sum of the individual voltage drops, $V_{s}$ and $V_{\\text{FE}}$.\n$$V_{total} = V_{s} + V_{\\text{FE}}$$\nFor a small perturbation in charge $\\mathrm{d}Q$, the corresponding change in total voltage $\\mathrm{d}V_{total}$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{d}V_{total} = \\mathrm{d}V_{s} + \\mathrm{d}V_{\\text{FE}}$$\nUsing the provided definition $\\mathrm{d}V = \\frac{1}{C}\\mathrm{d}Q$ for each component:\n$$\\mathrm{d}V_{total} = \\frac{1}{C_{s}}\\mathrm{d}Q + \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{FE}}}\\mathrm{d}Q = \\left(\\frac{1}{C_{s}} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{FE}}}\\right)\\mathrm{d}Q$$\nThe effective capacitance $C_{\\text{eff}}$ of the series combination is defined by the relation $C_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}V_{total}}$, which implies $\\mathrm{d}V_{total} = \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{eff}}}\\mathrm{d}Q$.\nBy comparing the two expressions for $\\mathrm{d}V_{total}$, we find the relationship for the inverse effective capacitance:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{C_{s}} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{FE}}}$$\nSolving for $C_{\\text{eff}}$ gives the expression:\n$$C_{\\text{eff}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{C_{s}} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{FE}}}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{C_{s}C_{\\text{FE}}}{C_{s} + C_{\\text{FE}}}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate the stability and $C_{\\text{eff}}$ for the given values: $C_{s} = 1.0\\ \\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2}$ and $C_{\\text{FE}} = -0.5\\ \\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2}$.\n\nTo check for stability, we evaluate the total energy curvature term:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_{s}} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{FE}}} = \\frac{1}{1.0\\ \\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2}} + \\frac{1}{-0.5\\ \\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2}} = (1.0 - 2.0)\\ (\\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2})^{-1} = -1.0\\ (\\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2})^{-1}$$\nSince $-1.0  0$, the stability criterion $\\frac{1}{C_{s}} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{FE}}} > 0$ is not satisfied. The operating point is unstable. Therefore, the stability flag is $0$.\n\nNow we calculate the value of $C_{\\text{eff}}$ using the derived formula:\n$$C_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{C_{s}C_{\\text{FE}}}{C_{s} + C_{\\text{FE}}} = \\frac{(1.0\\ \\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2})(-0.5\\ \\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2})}{1.0\\ \\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2} + (-0.5\\ \\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2})} = \\frac{-0.5\\ (\\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2})^{2}}{0.5\\ \\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2}} = -1.0\\ \\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2}$$\nThe effective capacitance is $-1.0\\ \\mu\\text{F/cm}^{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a two-entry row matrix. The first entry is the stability flag ($0$), and the second is the calculated value of $C_{\\text{eff}}$ ($-1.0$).",
