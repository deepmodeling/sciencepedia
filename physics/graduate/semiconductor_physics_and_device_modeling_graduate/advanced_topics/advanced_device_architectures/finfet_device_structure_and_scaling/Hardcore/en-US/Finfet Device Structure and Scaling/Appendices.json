It is a valid, formal problem in semiconductor device modeling.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivations\n\nThe electrostatic scaling length, $\\lambda$, characterizes the spatial decay of potential perturbations along the channel of a MOSFET. It is a crucial parameter for quantifying short-channel effects, as a smaller $\\lambda$ indicates better gate control over the channel. It is determined by solving Laplace's equation for the \"natural\" modes of the structure.\n\n**Part 1: Planar Scaling Length, $\\lambda_{\\text{planar}}$**\n\nWe consider a planar MOS structure, which can be modeled as a Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) device. Let the channel direction be $x$ and the direction perpendicular to the gate be $y$. The silicon film has thickness $t_{\\text{si}}$. The origin $y=0$ is at the back interface (Si-Insulator), and the gate-oxide interface is at $y=t_{\\text{si}}$.\n\nIn the charge-free silicon body, the potential $\\phi(x,y)$ obeys the 2D Laplace equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nWe seek solutions using the method of separation of variables, $\\phi(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. This leads to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{X}\\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} = -\\frac{1}{Y}\\frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2} = k^2 $$\nWe choose the separation constant to be $k^2 > 0$ to model exponential decay in the $x$-direction, which represents the penetration of electric fields from the source/drain regions into the channel. The characteristic scaling length is thus $\\lambda = 1/k$.\n\nThe equation for $Y(y)$ is $Y''(y) + k^2 Y(y) = 0$, with general solution $Y(y) = C_1 \\cos(ky) + C_2 \\sin(ky)$. We apply boundary conditions in the $y$-direction. For a thin-body SOI device, we assume no electric field at the back interface ($y=0$): $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}|_{y=0} = 0$. This implies $C_2=0$, so $Y(y) \\propto \\cos(ky)$.\n\nAt the front interface ($y=t_{\\text{si}}$), the normal component of the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D} = -\\epsilon\\nabla\\phi$ must be continuous. The solution in the oxide must also satisfy Laplace's equation. For a mode with $\\exp(-kx)$ dependence, the potential in the oxide can be written as $\\phi_{\\text{ox}}(x,y') \\propto \\exp(-kx) \\left( A\\cosh(ky') + B\\sinh(ky') \\right)$, where $y' = y - t_{\\text{si}}$. The boundary conditions at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface ($y'=0$) and the gate ($y'=t_{\\text{ox}}$) yield a characteristic equation for $k$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\text{si}} k \\tan(kt_{\\text{si}}) = \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}} $$\nThis is a simplified form assuming the potential varies linearly in the thin oxide, which is a very good approximation. For long-wavelength perturbations, where $\\lambda \\gg t_{\\text{si}}$ (or $kt_{\\text{si}} \\ll 1$), we can approximate $\\tan(kt_{\\text{si}}) \\approx kt_{\\text{si}}$. The characteristic equation becomes:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\text{si}} k (kt_{\\text{si}}) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}} $$\n$$ k^2 \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{\\epsilon_{\\text{si}} t_{\\text{si}} t_{\\text{ox}}} $$\nSince $\\lambda = 1/k$, the scaling length for the planar device is:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\text{planar}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{si}}}{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}} t_{\\text{si}} t_{\\text{ox}}} $$\n\n**Part 2: Tri-Gate Scaling Length, $\\lambda_{\\text{tri}}$**\n\nFor the tri-gate FinFET, the 2D cross-section ($y-z$ plane, if $x$ is the channel direction) is no longer a simple 1D stack. To find an approximate scaling length, we can map the 2D electrostatics onto an equivalent 1D planar problem. A common and physically motivated method is to define an effective silicon thickness, $t_{\\text{eff}}$. This thickness represents the average distance of charge carriers in the silicon body from the controlling gate. It is defined as the ratio of the silicon fin's cross-sectional area, $A$, to the perimeter of the fin covered by the gate, $P_{\\text{ug}}$.\n\nThe cross-sectional area is $A = W_{\\text{fin}}H_{\\text{fin}}$.\nThe gate covers the top and two sidewalls, so the perimeter under gate is $P_{\\text{ug}} = W_{\\text{fin}} + 2H_{\\text{fin}}$.\n\nThe effective electrostatic thickness is therefore:\n$$ t_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{A}{P_{\\text{ug}}} = \\frac{W_{\\text{fin}}H_{\\text{fin}}}{W_{\\text{fin}} + 2H_{\\text{fin}}} $$\nBy substituting this $t_{\\text{eff}}$ for $t_{\\text{si}}$ in the planar scaling length formula, we obtain an approximate scaling length for the tri-gate structure:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\text{tri}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{si}}}{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}} t_{\\text{eff}} t_{\\text{ox}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{si}}}{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}} \\left(\\frac{W_{\\text{fin}}H_{\\text{fin}}}{W_{\\text{fin}} + 2H_{\\text{fin}}}\\right) t_{\\text{ox}}} $$\n\n**Part 3: Relative Error Calculation**\n\nThe problem specifies a planar reference device where the silicon thickness is taken to be the fin width, $t_{\\text{si}} = W_{\\text{fin}}$. The scaling length for this reference device is:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\text{planar}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{si}}}{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}} W_{\\text{fin}} t_{\\text{ox}}} $$\nThe relative error $e$ is defined as $e = (\\lambda_{\\text{planar}} - \\lambda_{\\text{tri}})/\\lambda_{\\text{tri}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{planar}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{tri}}} - 1$.\nWe compute the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{planar}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{tri}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{si}}}{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}} W_{\\text{fin}} t_{\\text{ox}}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{si}}}{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}} \\frac{W_{\\text{fin}}H_{\\text{fin}}}{W_{\\text{fin}} + 2H_{\\text{fin}}} t_{\\text{ox}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{W_{\\text{fin}}}{\\frac{W_{\\text{fin}}H_{\\text{fin}}}{W_{\\text{fin}} + 2H_{\\text{fin}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{W_{\\text{fin}}(W_{\\text{fin}} + 2H_{\\text{fin}})}{W_{\\text{fin}}H_{\\text{fin}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{W_{\\text{fin}} + 2H_{\\text{fin}}}{H_{\\text{fin}}}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given values $W_{\\text{fin}} = 8\\,\\text{nm}$ and $H_{\\text{fin}} = 40\\,\\text{nm}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{planar}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{tri}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 + 2(40)}{40}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 + 80}{40}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{88}{40}} = \\sqrt{2.2} $$\nThe relative error $e$ is:\n$$ e = \\sqrt{2.2} - 1 \\approx 1.4832397 - 1 = 0.4832397 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $e \\approx 0.4832$.\n\n**Part 4: Correction Factor, $C_{\\text{pug}}$**\n\nThe correction factor $C_{\\text{pug}}$ is defined by the relation $\\lambda_{\\text{tri}} \\approx C_{\\text{pug}}\\,\\lambda_{\\text{planar}}$. From this definition, we have:\n$$ C_{\\text{pug}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{tri}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{planar}}} $$\nThis is the reciprocal of the ratio calculated in Part 3.\n$$ C_{\\text{pug}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{W_{\\text{fin}} + 2H_{\\text{fin}}}{H_{\\text{fin}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{H_{\\text{fin}}}{W_{\\text{fin}} + 2H_{\\text{fin}}}} $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the correction factor as a function of the fin dimensions.",

Assume the following device-level abstractions grounded in first principles:\n\n- The specific contact resistivity at the metal–semiconductor interface is $\\rho_{\\text{c}}$ and the contacted interface area for the multi-fin source/drain is the product of the contact length $L_{\\text{c}}$ along the transport direction and the lateral array width $N_{\\text{f}} p$ across the fins, so the total contacted area is $A_{\\text{c,tot}} = L_{\\text{c}} \\, N_{\\text{f}} \\, p$.\n- The extension region is a heavily doped thin film on the fin sidewalls and top, characterized by sheet resistance $R_{\\text{sh}}$ (ohms per square), and the current path length from the channel edge to the contact is $L_{\\text{ext}}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in semiconductor device modeling, grounded in established first principles of electrical resistance and standard abstractions for FinFET structures. All terms are clearly defined, the parameters are self-consistent, and the objective is to derive a closed-form expression, which is a well-posed task.\n\nThe total series resistance, $R_{\\text{series}}$, is the sum of the contributions from the source and drain terminals. The problem states that these are symmetric. Therefore, we can write:\n$$R_{\\text{series}} = R_{\\text{source}} + R_{\\text{drain}} = 2 R_{\\text{source}}$$\nThe resistance of a single terminal, such as the source, is composed of two parts: the contact resistance, $R_{\\text{contact,S}}$, and the source/drain extension resistance, $R_{\\text{extension,S}}$.\n$$R_{\\text{source}} = R_{\\text{contact,S}} + R_{\\text{extension,S}}$$\nWe will now derive each of these components based on the provided models.\n\nFirst, we analyze the contact resistance, $R_{\\text{contact,S}}$. The resistance of a contact is given by the specific contact resistivity, $\\rho_{\\text{c}}$ (in units of $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{cm}^{2}$), divided by the total contact area, $A_{\\text{c,tot}}$.\n$$R_{\\text{contact,S}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{c}}}{A_{\\text{c,tot}}}$$\nThe problem explicitly defines the total contacted area for the multi-fin structure as $A_{\\text{c,tot}} = L_{\\text{c}} \\, N_{\\text{f}} \\, p$, where $L_{\\text{c}}$ is the contact length, $N_{\\text{f}}$ is the number of fins, and $p$ is the fin pitch. Substituting this definition, we obtain the expression for the total contact resistance for one terminal:\n$$R_{\\text{contact,S}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{c}}}{L_{\\text{c}} N_{\\text{f}} p}$$\nThis model implies that the total contact area is proportional to the overall width of the fin array, $N_{\\text{f}} p$.\n\nNext, we analyze the extension resistance, $R_{\\text{extension,S}}$. This region is modeled as a thin film conductor with a given sheet resistance, $R_{\\text{sh}}$ (in units of $\\Omega/\\text{square}$). The resistance of a thin film is given by $R = R_{\\text{sh}} \\times N_{\\text{squares}}$, where $N_{\\text{squares}} = L/W$ is the number of squares, with $L$ being the length of the current path and $W$ being the width of the conductor.\n\nFor a single fin, the current path length is given as $L = L_{\\text{ext}}$. The effective conduction width per fin is the perimeter of the fin available for current flow, given as $W = W_{\\text{eff}} = 2 H_{\\text{fin}} + W_{\\text{fin}}$. Therefore, the extension resistance for a single fin, $R_{\\text{ext,1fin}}$, is:\n$$R_{\\text{ext,1fin}} = R_{\\text{sh}} \\frac{L_{\\text{ext}}}{W_{\\text{eff}}} = R_{\\text{sh}} \\frac{L_{\\text{ext}}}{2 H_{\\text{fin}} + W_{\\text{fin}}}$$\nThe problem states that the $N_{\\text{f}}$ fins conduct in parallel. For $N_{\\text{f}}$ identical resistors in parallel, the total resistance is the resistance of one divided by the number of parallel paths, $N_{\\text{f}}$. Thus, the total extension resistance for the source terminal is:\n$$R_{\\text{extension,S}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{ext,1fin}}}{N_{\\text{f}}} = \\frac{1}{N_{\\text{f}}} \\left( R_{\\text{sh}} \\frac{L_{\\text{ext}}}{2 H_{\\text{fin}} + W_{\\text{fin}}} \\right)$$\nNote that this component of the resistance is independent of the fin pitch, $p$.\n\nNow, we combine the components to find the total series resistance, $R_{\\text{series}}(p)$.\n$$R_{\\text{series}}(p) = 2 R_{\\text{source}} = 2 (R_{\\text{contact,S}} + R_{\\text{extension,S}})$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$R_{\\text{series}}(p) = 2 \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{c}}}{L_{\\text{c}} N_{\\text{f}} p} + \\frac{R_{\\text{sh}} L_{\\text{ext}}}{N_{\\text{f}} (2 H_{\\text{fin}} + W_{\\text{fin}})} \\right)$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the total series resistance as a function of fin pitch $p$.\n\nTo discuss the scaling of $R_{\\text{series}}(p)$ with decreasing pitch $p$, we examine the two terms in the expression. The first term, representing the total contact resistance for both source and drain, is $\\frac{2 \\rho_{\\text{c}}}{L_{\\text{c}} N_{\\text{f}} p}$. This term is inversely proportional to $p$. The second term, representing the total extension resistance, $\\frac{2 R_{\\text{sh}} L_{\\text{ext}}}{N_{\\text{f}} (2 H_{\\text{fin}} + W_{\\text{fin}})}$, is a constant with respect to $p$.\n\nAs the fin pitch $p$ is decreased (i.e., the fins are packed more densely), the contact resistance term increases because the modeled total contact area $A_{\\text{c,tot}}$ shrinks. The extension resistance term remains constant. Consequently, the total series resistance $R_{\\text{series}}(p)$ increases as $p$ decreases. For very small $p$, the contact resistance term becomes dominant. The qualitative scaling law is therefore:\n$$R_{\\text{series}}(p) \\propto \\frac{1}{p}$$\nThis highlights a critical challenge in device scaling, often termed the \"contact resistance bottleneck,\" where the benefits of device shrinkage can be offset by a parasitic resistance that increases with packing density.",

These are foundational and well-established principles in semiconductor device physics. The tri-gate FinFET model, where total current is a sum of its surface components, is a standard first-order approach. The model is a simplification, but the assumptions (e.g., neglecting second-order effects) are stated explicitly and are appropriate for a first-principles derivation. The setup is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem requests the derivation of an expression for a single unknown, $\\gamma$, and its subsequent calculation from complete datasets. The givens are sufficient to construct a single equation with $\\gamma$ as the only unknown. The provided physical parameters in the test cases are non-zero, ensuring the derived expression will be solvable. A unique solution for $\\gamma$ is expected for each dataset.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased technical language. It is free from any subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. No flaws are detected. Therefore, the problem is **valid**, and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the asymmetry parameter $\\gamma$ from the fundamental model of a FinFET's linear-regime current.\n\nThe drain current $I_s$ for a single MOSFET channel surface $s$ in the linear regime (small $V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$) is given by the drift equation:\n$$I_s = \\frac{W_s}{L} \\mu_s |Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}| V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$$\nwhere $W_s$ is the channel width of the surface, $L$ is the channel length, $\\mu_s$ is the carrier mobility on that surface, and $|Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}|$ is the magnitude of the inversion charge density per unit area.\n\nUsing the provided charge-sheet approximation, $Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s} \\approx C_{\\mathrm{ox},s} (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}})$, and assuming an n-channel device where $V_{\\mathrm{GS}} > V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, the equation becomes:\n$$I_s = \\frac{W_s}{L} \\mu_s C_{\\mathrm{ox},s} (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}) V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$$\n\nIn a tri-gate FinFET, the total drain current $I_{\\mathrm{D}}$ is the sum of the current from the top surface and the currents from the two identical sidewalls:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{D}} = I_{\\mathrm{top}} + 2 I_{\\mathrm{side}}$$\n\nWe can now express $I_{\\mathrm{top}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{side}}$ using the parameters given in the problem statement.\n\nFor the top surface:\n- Width: $W_s = W_{\\mathrm{top}}$\n- Mobility: $\\mu_s = \\mu_{\\mathrm{top}} = \\gamma \\mu_{\\mathrm{side}}$\n- Capacitance per unit area: $C_{\\mathrm{ox},s} = C_{\\mathrm{ox,top}}$\nThe current contribution from the top surface is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{top}} = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{top}}}{L} (\\gamma \\mu_{\\mathrm{side}}) C_{\\mathrm{ox,top}} (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}) V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$$\n\nFor each sidewall surface:\n- Effective width: $W_s = H_{\\mathrm{fin}}$\n- Mobility: $\\mu_s = \\mu_{\\mathrm{side}}$\n- Capacitance per unit area: $C_{\\mathrm{ox},s} = C_{\\mathrm{ox,side}}$\nThe current contribution from a single sidewall is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{side}} = \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{fin}}}{L} \\mu_{\\mathrm{side}} C_{\\mathrm{ox,side}} (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}) V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$$\n\nSumming the components to find the total current $I_{\\mathrm{D}}$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{top}}}{L} \\gamma \\mu_{\\mathrm{side}} C_{\\mathrm{ox,top}} (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}) V_{\\mathrm{DS}} + 2 \\left( \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{fin}}}{L} \\mu_{\\mathrm{side}} C_{\\mathrm{ox,side}} (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}) V_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\right)$$\n\nThis is the complete expression for the total drain current. Our task is to solve this equation for $\\gamma$. We can factor out the common terms to simplify the expression:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{side}} (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}) V_{\\mathrm{DS}}}{L} \\left[ \\gamma W_{\\mathrm{top}} C_{\\mathrm{ox,top}} + 2 H_{\\mathrm{fin}} C_{\\mathrm{ox,side}} \\right]$$\n\nTo isolate $\\gamma$, we first rearrange the equation to solve for the term in the brackets:\n$$ \\gamma W_{\\mathrm{top}} C_{\\mathrm{ox,top}} + 2 H_{\\mathrm{fin}} C_{\\mathrm{ox,side}} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{D}} L}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{side}} (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}) V_{\\mathrm{DS}}}$$\n\nNext, we move the sidewall contribution term to the right-hand side:\n$$ \\gamma W_{\\mathrm{top}} C_{\\mathrm{ox,top}} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{D}} L}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{side}} (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}) V_{\\mathrm{DS}}} - 2 H_{\\mathrm{fin}} C_{\\mathrm{ox,side}} $$\n\nFinally, we divide by $W_{\\mathrm{top}} C_{\\mathrm{ox,top}}$ to obtain the final expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{W_{\\mathrm{top}} C_{\\mathrm{ox,top}}} \\left[ \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{D}} L}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{side}} (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{th}}) V_{\\mathrm{DS}}} - 2 H_{\\mathrm{fin}} C_{\\mathrm{ox,side}} \\right] $$\nThis expression allows for the direct computation of the asymmetry parameter $\\gamma$ from the given structural, material, and electrical parameters. This expression will be implemented to solve for $\\gamma$ for each test case.",
