The stack, from top to bottom, consists of a front gate metal, a front gate oxide, a silicon film, a buried oxide, and a grounded handle wafer acting as a back gate. The front gate voltage is applied relative to the back gate. The front gate oxide has thickness $t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ and permittivity $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, the silicon film has thickness $t_{\\mathrm{si}}$ and permittivity $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}$, and the buried oxide (BOX) has thickness $t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$ and permittivity $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$.\n\nYou may assume the following:\n- Quasi-static conditions and uniformly distributed, one-dimensional normal fields, neglecting fringing fields and quantum confinement.\n- Linear, homogeneous dielectrics with $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}$ and $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = \\rho_{f}$, where $\\rho_{f}$ is the free charge density.\n- In strong inversion, the silicon film interior is fully depleted of mobile carriers and any inversion charge is confined to an infinitesimally thin sheet at the front interface.\n- In accumulation, the front interface hosts an infinitesimally thin sheet of majority carriers whose response screens the normal electric field inside the silicon film.\n\nStarting from Gauss’s law and the continuity conditions for the normal component of electric displacement across interfaces, derive how the applied front gate voltage divides across the front gate oxide, the silicon film, and the buried oxide in the two regimes:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the voltage division across a fully depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (FD-SOI) MOSFET stack in two distinct operating regimes: accumulation and inversion. We will then calculate the fraction of the applied gate voltage that drops across the silicon film for each case.\n\nLet us define a one-dimensional coordinate system, $z$, perpendicular to the layers, with $z=0$ at the front gate/oxide interface. The front gate is at potential $V_G$, and the back gate (handle wafer) is grounded, $V_{BG}=0$. The interfaces are located at:\n-   Front oxide/silicon interface: $z = t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$\n-   Silicon/buried oxide interface: $z = t_{\\mathrm{ox}} + t_{\\mathrm{si}}$\n-   Buried oxide/back gate interface: $z = t_{\\mathrm{ox}} + t_{\\mathrm{si}} + t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$\n\nThe total applied voltage $V_G$ is divided across the three dielectric layers:\n$$V_G = \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{ox}} + \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}} + \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$$\nwhere $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}}$, and $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$ are the potential drops across the front gate oxide, silicon film, and buried oxide, respectively.\n\nUnder the one-dimensional approximation with no charge in the bulk of the dielectrics, the electric field $E$ is constant within each layer. The voltage drop across a layer of thickness $t$ is $\\Delta V = E \\cdot t$. The electric displacement field is $D = \\epsilon E$. We can express the voltage drop in terms of the displacement field $D$ and the capacitance per unit area of each layer, $C = \\epsilon/t$:\n$$ \\Delta V = E \\cdot t = \\frac{D}{\\epsilon} \\cdot t = \\frac{D}{\\epsilon/t} = \\frac{D}{C} $$\nThus, the voltage drops are:\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{ox}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}, \\quad \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{si}}}{C_{\\mathrm{si}}}, \\quad \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{BOX}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{BOX}}}{C_{\\mathrm{BOX}}} $$\nwhere $C_{\\mathrm{ox}} = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}/t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, $C_{\\mathrm{si}} = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}/t_{\\mathrm{si}}$, and $C_{\\mathrm{BOX}} = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BOX}}/t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$.\n\nWe now analyze the two specified regimes based on the problem's assumptions.\n\n**1. Accumulation at the Front Interface**\n\nThe problem states that in accumulation, the sheet of majority carriers at the front interface \"screens the normal electric field inside the silicon film.\" This is an idealized statement implying that the accumulation charge layer behaves as a perfect conductor held at the potential of the bulk silicon, which is coupled to the back gate. In this 1D electrostatic model, this means the accumulation layer effectively makes the entire silicon film an equipotential region at the back gate potential, which is $0\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThis screening means the electric field inside the silicon film must be zero:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{si}} = 0 $$\nConsequently, the electric displacement field in the silicon is also zero:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{si}} = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} E_{\\mathrm{si}} = 0 $$\nThe voltage drop across the silicon film is therefore zero:\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}} = E_{\\mathrm{si}} \\cdot t_{\\mathrm{si}} = 0 $$\nThe fraction of the applied gate voltage that drops across the silicon film in accumulation is:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}}}{V_G} \\right)_{\\mathrm{acc}} = \\frac{0}{V_G} = 0 $$\nThis is an exact result based on the ideal screening assumption.\n\n**2. Inversion at the Front Interface**\n\nIn this regime, the problem states the silicon film is \"fully depleted.\" This means the film is devoid of mobile charge carriers and behaves as a simple, uniform dielectric. Although an inversion charge sheet exists at the front interface, the voltage division across the bulk of the layers is determined by the series combination of their capacitances. In this simplified electrostatic model, we consider the stack as three capacitors in series between the front and back gates.\n\nFor capacitors in series, the displacement field $D$ is constant throughout the stack, assuming no net charge at the internal interfaces (a consequence of the \"fully depleted\" idealization for the bulk potential division).\n$$ D = D_{\\mathrm{ox}} = D_{\\mathrm{si}} = D_{\\mathrm{BOX}} $$\nThe total voltage $V_G$ is the sum of the voltage drops across the series capacitors:\n$$ V_G = \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{ox}} + \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}} + \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{BOX}} = \\frac{D}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + \\frac{D}{C_{\\mathrm{si}}} + \\frac{D}{C_{\\mathrm{BOX}}} $$\n$$ V_G = D \\left( \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{si}}} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{BOX}}} \\right) $$\nThe voltage drop across the silicon film is:\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}} = \\frac{D}{C_{\\mathrm{si}}} $$\nThe fraction of the applied gate voltage that drops across the silicon film is the ratio of the potential drop across silicon to the total potential drop:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}}}{V_G} \\right)_{\\mathrm{inv}} = \\frac{D/C_{\\mathrm{si}}}{D \\left( C_{\\mathrm{ox}}^{-1} + C_{\\mathrm{si}}^{-1} + C_{\\mathrm{BOX}}^{-1} \\right)} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{si}}^{-1}}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}^{-1} + C_{\\mathrm{si}}^{-1} + C_{\\mathrm{BOX}}^{-1}} $$\nSubstituting $C^{-1} = t/\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}}}{V_G} \\right)_{\\mathrm{inv}} = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{si}}/\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}}{t_{\\mathrm{ox}}/\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} + t_{\\mathrm{si}}/\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} + t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}/\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BOX}}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given parameters:\n-   $t_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 3.9\\,\\epsilon_{0}$\n-   $t_{\\mathrm{si}} = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} = 11.7\\,\\epsilon_{0}$\n-   $t_{\\mathrm{BOX}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BOX}} = 3.9\\,\\epsilon_{0}$\n\nThe vacuum permittivity $\\epsilon_0$ will cancel from the numerator and denominator.\n$$ \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}} = \\frac{1.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{3.9\\,\\epsilon_0} $$\n$$ \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{si}}}{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}} = \\frac{8.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{11.7\\,\\epsilon_0} $$\n$$ \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}}{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BOX}}} = \\frac{150\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{3.9\\,\\epsilon_0} $$\nThe fraction becomes:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}}}{V_G} \\right)_{\\mathrm{inv}} = \\frac{8.0/11.7}{1.8/3.9 + 8.0/11.7 + 150/3.9} $$\nTo simplify the arithmetic, we note that $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} = 3 \\times \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}$.\nLet the terms be $X_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 1.8/3.9$, $X_{\\mathrm{si}} = 8.0/11.7$, and $X_{\\mathrm{BOX}} = 150/3.9$.\n$$ X_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\approx 0.461538 $$\n$$ X_{\\mathrm{si}} = 8.0/(3 \\times 3.9) \\approx 0.683761 $$\n$$ X_{\\mathrm{BOX}} \\approx 38.461538 $$\nThe fraction is:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}}}{V_G} \\right)_{\\mathrm{inv}} = \\frac{0.683761}{0.461538 + 0.683761 + 38.461538} = \\frac{0.683761}{39.606837} \\approx 0.0172637 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.01726$.\n\nThe two fractions are $0$ for the accumulation regime and $0.01726$ for the inversion regime.",

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in semiconductor device physics that asks for the derivation of the transconductance of a long-channel Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (FDSOI) MOSFET. All necessary parameters and starting principles are provided.\n\nThe derivation of the front-gate transconductance, $g_{m} \\equiv \\partial I_{D} / \\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$, proceeds in three main steps:\n1.  Derive the drain current $I_D$ by integrating the drift current along the channel.\n2.  Establish the relationship between the inversion charge $Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}$ and the gate voltages ($V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$, $V_{\\mathrm{GB}}$) and the silicon potential $\\psi$ using the capacitive model of the device.\n3.  Differentiate the drain current $I_D$ with respect to the front-gate voltage $V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$ to obtain $g_m$.\n\nStep 1: Drain Current $I_D$\nThe drain current $I_D$ in a MOSFET is driven by the drift of inversion charge carriers in the channel. For a device of width $W$ with carrier mobility $\\mu$, the drift current at a position $y$ along the channel is given by:\n$$I_D = W \\mu [-Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}(y)] E(y)$$\nwhere $-Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}(y)$ is the mobile inversion charge per unit area (a positive quantity for an n-channel MOSFET) and $E(y) = dV/dy$ is the local electric field, with $V(y)$ being the channel quasi-Fermi potential. Substituting for $E(y)$:\n$$I_D = W \\mu [-Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}(y)] \\frac{dV}{dy}$$\nWe can separate variables and integrate along the channel from the source ($y=0$, $V=0$) to the drain ($y=L$, $V=V_D$):\n$$I_D \\int_0^L dy = W \\mu \\int_0^{V_D} [-Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}(V)] dV$$\nAs $I_D$ is constant along the channel in steady state, this becomes:\n$$I_D L = W \\mu \\int_0^{V_D} [-Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}(V)] dV$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we must express the mobile inversion charge, let's call it $Q_n(V) = -Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}(V)$ (a positive quantity for an n-channel device), as a function of the local channel potential $V$. The charge $Q_n$ depends on the difference between the silicon potential and the local quasi-Fermi level, i.e., $Q_n = f(\\psi_s - V)$. For the small $V_D$ assumed in the linear region, we can linearize $Q_n(V)$ around the source ($V=0$):\n$$Q_n(V) \\approx Q_n(V=0) + V \\left. \\frac{\\partial Q_n(\\psi_s - V)}{\\partial V} \\right|_{V=0}$$\nLet $Q_{n,s} = Q_n(V=0)$ be the mobile charge density at the source. The derivative term is found using the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial Q_n(\\psi_s-V)}{\\partial V} = \\frac{\\partial Q_n}{\\partial(\\psi_s-V)} \\frac{\\partial(\\psi_s-V)}{\\partial V} = \\frac{\\partial Q_n}{\\partial \\psi_s} (-1) $$\nFrom the problem definition, the quantum capacitance is $C_q = -\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}/\\partial \\psi = \\partial Q_n/\\partial \\psi$. Therefore, the derivative is $-C_q$. The linearized mobile charge is:\n$$Q_n(V) \\approx Q_{n,s} - C_q V$$\nSubstituting this into the integral for $I_D$:\n$$I_D L = W \\mu \\int_0^{V_D} (Q_{n,s} - C_q V) dV = W \\mu \\left[ Q_{n,s}V - \\frac{1}{2}C_q V^2 \\right]_0^{V_D}$$\n$$I_D = \\frac{W\\mu}{L} \\left( Q_{n,s}V_D - \\frac{1}{2}C_q V_D^2 \\right)$$\n\nStep 2: Relation between Charge and Gate Voltage\nThe FDSOI device can be modeled as a network of capacitors. The problem directs us to use Gauss's law and charge neutrality. For the entire MOS structure, the sum of charges must be zero. Let $Q_{Gf}$ and $Q_{Gb}$ be the charges on the front and back gates, and $Q_{si}$ be the charge in the silicon film.\n$$Q_{Gf} + Q_{Gb} + Q_{si} = 0$$\nThe gate charges are $Q_{Gf} = C_f(V_{\\mathrm{GF}} - \\psi)$ and $Q_{Gb} = C_b(V_{\\mathrm{GB}} - \\psi)$. The silicon charge is $Q_{si} = Q_{\\mathrm{inv}} + Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}$, where $Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}$ is the fixed depletion charge in the fully depleted film.\n$$C_f(V_{\\mathrm{GF}} - \\psi) + C_b(V_{\\mathrm{GB}} - \\psi) + Q_{\\mathrm{inv}} + Q_{\\mathrm{dep}} = 0$$\nTo find the relationship between small-signal changes, we differentiate this equation with respect to $V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$, holding $V_{\\mathrm{GB}}$ constant. This is evaluated at the source end, where $\\psi=\\psi_s$. We treat $Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}$ as a constant.\n$$C_f\\left(1 - \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}}\\right) + C_b\\left(0 - \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = 0$$\nWe relate $\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}/\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$ to $\\partial \\psi_s/\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$ using the chain rule and the definition of $C_q$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = \\frac{\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}}{\\partial \\psi_s} \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = -C_q \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}}$$\nSubstituting this into the differentiated charge-balance equation:\n$$C_f - C_f \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} - C_b \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} - C_q \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = 0$$\n$$C_f = (C_f + C_b + C_q) \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}}$$\nThis gives the change in silicon potential with respect to the front-gate voltage:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = \\frac{C_f}{C_f + C_b + C_q}$$\nWe are interested in the change of the mobile charge $Q_{n,s} = -Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_{n,s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = \\frac{\\partial (-Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s})}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = -\\frac{\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = - \\left( -C_q \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} \\right) = C_q \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\partial \\psi_s/\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_{n,s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = C_q \\left( \\frac{C_f}{C_f + C_b + C_q} \\right) = \\frac{C_f C_q}{C_f + C_b + C_q}$$\n\nStep 3: Transconductance $g_m$\nThe front-gate transconductance is defined as $g_m = \\partial I_D / \\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$. We differentiate the expression for $I_D$ from Step 1:\n$$g_m = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} \\left[ \\frac{W\\mu}{L} \\left( Q_{n,s}V_D - \\frac{1}{2}C_q V_D^2 \\right) \\right]$$\n$$g_m = \\frac{W\\mu}{L} \\left( V_D \\frac{\\partial Q_{n,s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} - \\frac{1}{2}V_D^2 \\frac{\\partial C_q}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} \\right)$$\nThe problem gives $C_q$ as a parameter for the final expression, which implies it should be treated as a constant for the purpose of this differentiation. This is a standard approximation in this context. Therefore, we set $\\partial C_q / \\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}} = 0$. The expression for $g_m$ simplifies to:\n$$g_m = \\frac{W\\mu V_D}{L} \\frac{\\partial Q_{n,s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}}$$\nNote that this is the same result that would be obtained by using the linear approximation for the current, $I_D \\approx (W\\mu/L)Q_{n,s}V_D$, valid for small $V_D$.\nFinally, we substitute the result for $\\partial Q_{n,s}/\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$ from Step 2:\n$$g_m = \\frac{W\\mu V_D}{L} \\left( \\frac{C_f C_q}{C_f + C_b + C_q} \\right)$$\nThis is the final expression for the transconductance in terms of the given parameters.",

Derivation of the Ground-State Quantization Energy $E_1$**\n\nThe ultra-thin silicon film of thickness $t_{si}$ acts as a potential well, confining the inversion-layer electrons in the direction perpendicular to the silicon/oxide interface (let's call this the $z$-direction). The simplest, physically justified model for this confinement is a one-dimensional infinite potential well, where the potential $V(z)$ is $0$ for $0 < z < t_{si}$ and infinite otherwise. This represents the high energy barriers at the interfaces.\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for an electron in this potential is:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_z^*} \\frac{d^2\\psi(z)}{dz^2} = E \\psi(z) \\quad \\text{for } 0 < z < t_{si} $$\nwhere $m_z^*$ is the electron effective mass in the confinement direction, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\psi(z)$ is the electron wavefunction, and $E$ is its energy.\n\nThe boundary conditions for an infinite potential well are that the wavefunction must be zero at the boundaries: $\\psi(0) = 0$ and $\\psi(t_{si}) = 0$. The general solution to the differential equation is $\\psi(z) = A\\sin(kz) + B\\cos(kz)$.\n- The condition $\\psi(0)=0$ implies $B=0$.\n- The condition $\\psi(t_{si})=0$ implies $A\\sin(kt_{si})=0$, which requires $kt_{si} = n\\pi$ for an integer $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. (The case $n=0$ is trivial, and negative $n$ are redundant).\nThus, the allowed wavevectors are $k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{t_{si}}$.\n\nSubstituting $k_n$ back into the Schrödinger equation by relating energy and momentum ($p=\\hbar k$), we find the quantized energy levels:\n$$ E_n = \\frac{p_n^2}{2m_z^*} = \\frac{(\\hbar k_n)^2}{2m_z^*} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_z^*} \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{t_{si}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{n^2\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2m_z^*t_{si}^2} $$\nThe ground-state energy corresponds to the lowest possible energy level, $n=1$:\n$$ E_1 = \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2m_z^*t_{si}^2} $$\nThis energy will be calculated using the two provided effective mass bounds: $m_{z,\\text{heavy}}^* = 0.916\\,m_0$ and $m_{z,\\text{light}}^* = 0.19\\,m_0$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Classical Threshold Voltage $V_{T,\\text{classical}}$**\n\nThe gate voltage $V_G$ of a MOSFET is related to the internal potentials and charges by the MOS capacitor equation:\n$$ V_G = V_{fb} + \\psi_s + V_{ox} $$\nwhere $V_{fb}$ is the flatband voltage, $\\psi_s$ is the potential at the silicon surface, and $V_{ox}$ is the voltage drop across the gate oxide.\n\nThe threshold condition is defined classically by the onset of strong inversion, which for a p-type body occurs when the surface potential equals twice the bulk Fermi potential, $\\psi_s = 2\\phi_F$. The Fermi potential is given by:\n$$ \\phi_F = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right) $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, $q$ is the elementary charge, $N_A$ is the acceptor doping concentration, and $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration.\n\nThe voltage drop across the oxide is related to the total charge per unit area in the semiconductor, $Q_{semi}$, via Gauss's law: $V_{ox} = -Q_{semi}/C_{ox}$. The oxide capacitance per unit area is $C_{ox} = \\varepsilon_{ox}/t_{ox}$, where $\\varepsilon_{ox}$ is the oxide permittivity and $t_{ox}$ is its thickness.\n\nFor a fully depleted SOI film, the entire silicon body of thickness $t_{si}$ is depleted of mobile holes at and beyond threshold. The total depletion charge per unit area is the integrated charge of the ionized acceptors:\n$$ Q_{dep} = -q N_A t_{si} $$\nAt the threshold of inversion, the inversion charge is by definition still negligible compared to the depletion charge. Thus, $Q_{semi} \\approx Q_{dep}$.\n\nSubstituting these components into the gate voltage equation gives the classical threshold voltage, $V_{T,\\text{classical}}$:\n$$ V_{T,\\text{classical}} = V_{fb} + 2\\phi_F - \\frac{Q_{dep}}{C_{ox}} = V_{fb} + 2\\phi_F + \\frac{q N_A t_{si}}{C_{ox}} $$\nExpressing $C_{ox}$ in terms of its parameters, we get the final expression:\n$$ V_{T,\\text{classical}} = V_{fb} + 2\\phi_F + \\frac{q N_A t_{si} t_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} $$\nFor this problem, $V_{fb}=0\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Threshold Voltage Shift $\\Delta V_T$**\n\nQuantum confinement elevates the lowest possible energy state for an electron from the classical conduction band edge, $E_c$, to $E_c + E_1$. To achieve the same inversion condition (i.e., to populate these new ground states to the same level as the classical band edge would have been populated), the energy bands must be bent further. Specifically, the potential energy of the electrons must be lowered by an additional amount $E_1$. This corresponds to an increase in the electrostatic potential at the surface by $\\Delta\\psi_s = E_1/q$.\n\nThis additional surface potential must be supplied by the gate. In a simplified model based on \"energy alignment arguments,\" we assume a direct correspondence between the required increase in surface potential and the increase in gate voltage needed to cause it. Therefore, the threshold voltage must increase by this amount:\n$$ \\Delta V_T = \\frac{E_1}{q} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_1$:\n$$ \\Delta V_T = \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2q m_z^*t_{si}^2} $$\nThe lower and upper bounds for this shift, $\\Delta V_{T,\\text{low}}$ and $\\Delta V_{T,\\text{high}}$, correspond to the heavier and lighter effective masses, respectively, since $E_1$ is inversely proportional to $m_z^*$:\n$$ \\Delta V_{T,\\text{low}} = \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2q m_{z,\\text{heavy}}^* t_{si}^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta V_{T,\\text{high}} = \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2q m_{z,\\text{light}}^* t_{si}^2} $$\n\n**4. Derivation of the Relative Drain Current Error $\\delta I_D$**\n\nIn the linear operating regime, the drain current $I_D$ is proportional to the mobile inversion charge per unit area, $Q_{inv}$, and the small drain-source voltage, $V_{DS}$. For a fixed $V_{DS}$, we have $I_D \\propto |Q_{inv}|$.\n\nThe inversion charge is controlled by the gate overdrive voltage, which is the amount of gate voltage applied above the threshold voltage. Classically, this is $V_{OV, \\text{classical}} = V_G - V_{T,\\text{classical}}$. The problem statement defines $V_{OV} = V_{OV, \\text{classical}}$. The classical model predicts an inversion charge $|Q_{inv,\\text{classical}}| \\propto V_{OV}$, leading to a current:\n$$ I_{D,\\text{classical}} \\propto V_{OV} $$\nWith quantum mechanics, the threshold voltage is higher: $V_{T,\\text{QM}} = V_{T,\\text{classical}} + \\Delta V_T$. The effective gate overdrive is reduced:\n$$ V_{OV,\\text{QM}} = V_G - V_{T,\\text{QM}} = (V_{T,\\text{classical}} + V_{OV}) - (V_{T,\\text{classical}} + \\Delta V_T) = V_{OV} - \\Delta V_T $$\nThe quantum-mechanically correct current is therefore:\n$$ I_{D,\\text{QM}} \\propto V_{OV} - \\Delta V_T $$\nThe relative error in the classical current prediction is defined as the difference between the classical and quantum currents, normalized by the classical current:\n$$ \\delta I_D = \\frac{I_{D,\\text{classical}} - I_{D,\\text{QM}}}{I_{D,\\text{classical}}} = \\frac{K \\cdot V_{OV} - K(V_{OV} - \\Delta V_T)}{K \\cdot V_{OV}} = \\frac{\\Delta V_T}{V_{OV}} $$\nwhere $K$ is the proportionality constant.\n\nThe problem specifies a cap on this error. If the quantum correction $\\Delta V_T$ is greater than or equal to the classical overdrive $V_{OV}$, the effective overdrive $V_{OV, \\text{QM}}$ becomes non-positive. This means the device, predicted to be 'on' by the classical model, is actually 'off' (or sub-threshold). The quantum current $I_{D,\\text{QM}}$ is effectively zero. In this case, the relative error is:\n$$ \\delta I_D = \\frac{I_{D,\\text{classical}} - 0}{I_{D,\\text{classical}}} = 1 $$\nCombining these conditions, the general expression for the relative error is:\n$$ \\delta I_D = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{\\Delta V_T}{V_{OV}}\\right) $$\nThe lower and upper bounds, $\\delta I_{D,\\text{low}}$ and $\\delta I_{D,\\text{high}}$, are calculated using $\\Delta V_{T,\\text{low}}$ and $\\Delta V_{T,\\text{high}}$, respectively.\n\n**5. Sufficiency Criterion**\n\nA classical model is deemed sufficient if its predictions are within a given tolerance for the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario corresponds to the largest quantum corrections, which are given by the upper-bound values (derived from the lighter effective mass). The criterion is met if both the threshold voltage shift and the relative current error are below their respective tolerances:\n- $\\Delta V_{T,\\text{high}} < V_{tol}$, where $V_{tol} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n- $\\delta I_{D,\\text{high}} < r_{tol}$, where $r_{tol} = 0.1$.\n\nAn indicator variable $s$ will be set to $1$ if both conditions are true, and $0$ otherwise.",
