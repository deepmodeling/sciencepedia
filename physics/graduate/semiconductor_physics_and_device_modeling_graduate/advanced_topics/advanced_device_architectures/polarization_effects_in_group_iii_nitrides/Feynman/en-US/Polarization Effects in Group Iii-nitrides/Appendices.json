            "problem": "Consider a semi-infinite, nominally undoped, wurtzite gallium nitride (GaN) crystal terminated by a free surface into vacuum on the gallium face of the crystallographic $c$-plane. Let the outward unit normal at the GaN/vacuum interface be $\\hat{n}=\\hat{c}$, where $\\hat{c}$ denotes the unit vector along the crystallographic $c$-axis pointing outward from the Ga-face. The material exhibits a uniform spontaneous polarization $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}}$ in the bulk due to its non-centrosymmetric wurtzite structure. Assume that in GaN the spontaneous polarization vector is oriented antiparallel to $\\hat{c}$ with magnitude $P_{0}$, so that $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}}=-P_{0}\\,\\hat{c}$ with $P_{0}=2.90\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{C\\,m^{-2}}$.

The final answer must be a single real-valued number.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the bound surface charge density at a GaN/vacuum interface, followed by an explanation of its compensation by surface states.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Bound Surface Charge Density**\nWe begin with the provided fundamental equations from macroscopic electrodynamics. Maxwell's equation for the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{D}=\\rho_{\\text{free}}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_{\\text{free}}$ is the volume density of free charges. The constitutive relation connecting $\\mathbf{D}$ to the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ and the polarization vector $\\mathbf{P}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D}=\\varepsilon_{0}\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{P}\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space.\n\nSubstituting the constitutive relation into the Maxwell equation gives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (\\varepsilon_{0}\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{P}) = \\rho_{\\text{free}}\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the divergence operator, we have:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{0}(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P} = \\rho_{\\text{free}}\n$$\nFrom the differential form of Gauss's law, we know that the divergence of the electric field is related to the *total* charge density, $\\rho_{\\text{total}}$, by $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\rho_{\\text{total}} / \\varepsilon_{0}$. The total charge density is the sum of the free charge density and the bound charge density, $\\rho_{\\text{bound}}$: $\\rho_{\\text{total}} = \\rho_{\\text{free}} + \\rho_{\\text{bound}}$.\n\nSubstituting this into our equation yields:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{0} \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{free}} + \\rho_{\\text{bound}}}{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\right) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P} = \\rho_{\\text{free}}\n$$\n$$\n(\\rho_{\\text{free}} + \\rho_{\\text{bound}}) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P} = \\rho_{\\text{free}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to an expression for the bound volume charge density in terms of the polarization vector:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{bound}} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P}\n$$\nThis result is general. In the context of polar semiconductors like GaN, the total polarization $\\mathbf{P}$ can be separated into a field-induced part and a \"built-in\" part. The built-in polarization, which includes spontaneous ($\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}}$) and piezoelectric ($\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{pz}}$) components, is treated as a fundamental property of the material. The charge density associated with this built-in polarization, $\\rho_{\\text{pol}} = -\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}} + \\mathbf{P}_{\\text{pz}})$, acts as a fixed source of charge. The problem specifies a uniform spontaneous polarization $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}}$ and no strain, so we only consider $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}}$. Since $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}}$ is uniform within the GaN bulk, the bound volume charge density is $\\rho_{\\text{bound}} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}} = 0$ inside the material.\n\nA bound surface charge density, $\\sigma_b$, arises where there is a discontinuity in the polarization vector, such as at the GaN/vacuum interface. To find $\\sigma_b$, we integrate the bound volume charge density $\\rho_{\\text{bound}}$ over a small \"pillbox\" volume $V$ that straddles the interface. Let the area of the pillbox's top and bottom faces be $A$ and its height be $h$. The total bound charge in this volume is $Q_{\\text{bound}} = \\int_V \\rho_{\\text{bound}} dV$.\n$$\nQ_{\\text{bound}} = \\int_V (-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}}) dV\n$$\nApplying the divergence theorem, we convert the volume integral into a surface integral over the closed surface $S$ of the pillbox:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{bound}} = -\\oint_S \\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}\n$$\nThe surface $S$ consists of a top cap in the vacuum, a bottom cap in the GaN, and the side walls. Let $\\hat{n}$ be the outward unit normal vector from the GaN surface into the vacuum. The surface element vector $d\\mathbf{S}$ points outwards from the pillbox volume. Thus, on the top cap $d\\mathbf{S} = \\hat{n} dA$ and on the bottom cap $d\\mathbf{S} = -\\hat{n} dA$. In the limit as the height $h \\to 0$, the contribution from the side walls vanishes. The integral becomes:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{bound}} = -\\left[ \\int_{\\text{top}} (\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp, vac}} \\cdot \\hat{n}) dA + \\int_{\\text{bottom}} (\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp, GaN}} \\cdot (-\\hat{n})) dA \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}}$ is uniform over each face, we have:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{bound}} = -(\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp, vac}} \\cdot \\hat{n} - \\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp, GaN}} \\cdot \\hat{n}) A = -(\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp, vac}} - \\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp, GaN}}) \\cdot \\hat{n} A\n$$\nThe bound surface charge density $\\sigma_b$ is $Q_{\\text{bound}} / A$. Therefore, the general expression for the bound surface charge density at an interface is:\n$$\n\\sigma_b = -(\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp, above}} - \\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp, below}}) \\cdot \\hat{n}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{n}$ points from \"below\" (GaN) to \"above\" (vacuum). For this problem, we are given:\n- Medium below: GaN, with $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp, GaN}} = \\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}}$.\n- Medium above: Vacuum, with $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp, vac}} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n- Outward normal: $\\hat{n}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\sigma_b = -(\\mathbf{0} - \\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}}) \\cdot \\hat{n} = \\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}} \\cdot \\hat{n}\n$$\nThis is the desired expression for the bound surface charge density in terms of $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}}$ and $\\hat{n}$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given the following values for the Ga-face GaN surface:\n- $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sp}} = -P_{0}\\,\\hat{c}$\n- $P_{0} = 2.90 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{C\\,m^{-2}}$\n- $\\hat{n} = \\hat{c}$\n\nSubstituting these into our derived formula for $\\sigma_b$:\n$$\n\\sigma_b = (-P_{0}\\,\\hat{c}) \\cdot \\hat{c}\n$$\nSince $\\hat{c}$ is a unit vector, $\\hat{c} \\cdot \\hat{c} = 1$.\n$$\n\\sigma_b = -P_{0}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical value of $P_0$:\n$$\n\\sigma_b = -2.90 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{C\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Compensation by Electronic Surface States**\nThe calculated bound surface charge density $\\sigma_b$ is negative. This sheet of fixed negative charge at the GaN surface creates an electric field that points towards the surface from both the vacuum and the semiconductor bulk. Inside the semiconductor, this electric field causes an upward bending of the electronic energy bands (conduction band minimum $E_C$, valence band maximum $E_V$) as they approach the surface.\n\nElectronic surface states are energy levels that exist within the band gap at the semiconductor/vacuum interface. Their occupancy is determined by the position of the Fermi level at the surface, $E_{FS}$. For the system to reach electrostatic equilibrium, a compensating charge must form at the surface to screen the field from the polarization charge. This compensating charge is provided by the filling or emptying of surface states.\n\nTo compensate the negative charge $\\sigma_b$, a positive sheet charge is required. This positive charge, denoted $Q_{\\text{ss}}$, can be formed if there are donor-like surface states. Donor-like states are neutral when occupied by an electron and become positively charged when empty (ionized). The upward band bending pushes the energy levels of these surface states above the Fermi level, causing them to be emptied of electrons and thus creating the required positive sheet charge $Q_{\\text{ss}}>0$. This opposing charge reduces the net surface charge and the magnitude of the band bending, moving the system towards equilibrium.\n\n**Part 4: Condition for Complete Electrostatic Compensation**\nComplete electrostatic compensation occurs when the net surface charge density is zero. This condition nullifies the macroscopic electric field far from the interface. The total surface charge density is the sum of the fixed bound charge $\\sigma_b$ and the free charge $Q_{\\text{ss}}$ trapped in surface states.\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{total}} = \\sigma_b + Q_{\\text{ss}}\n$$\nFor complete compensation, $\\sigma_{\\text{total}} = 0$, which leads to the condition:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{ss}} = -\\sigma_b\n$$\nUsing our calculated value for $\\sigma_b$:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{ss}} = -(-P_0) = P_0\n$$\nThus, complete compensation requires a sheet density of free positive charge from ionized surface states equal in magnitude to the spontaneous polarization, $Q_{\\text{ss}} = 2.90 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{C\\,m^{-2}}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the bound sheet charge density.\n$$\n\\sigma_b = -2.90 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{C\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nThe value is already expressed with three significant figures.",

We may proceed with the solution, which is divided into three parts as requested.\n\nThe polarization profile is given by\n$$P(z) = P_{1} + \\frac{\\Delta P}{2}\\left[1 + \\tanh\\left(\\frac{z}{w}\\right)\\right]$$\nwhere $\\Delta P = P_{2} - P_{1}$. The bound charge density, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z)$, is given by the one-dimensional form of the relation $ \\rho_{\\mathrm{b}} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P} $, which is $ \\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z) = -\\frac{dP(z)}{dz} $.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of $\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z)$ and its limit as $w \\to 0^{+}$**\n\nFirst, we derive the analytic expression for the bound charge density $\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z)$ by differentiating $P(z)$ with respect to $z$.\nThe derivative of the hyperbolic tangent function is $\\frac{d}{du}\\tanh(u) = \\text{sech}^{2}(u)$. Using the chain rule, we find the derivative of $P(z)$:\n$$\\frac{dP(z)}{dz} = \\frac{d}{dz} \\left[ P_{1} + \\frac{\\Delta P}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta P}{2}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{z}{w}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2} \\cdot \\text{sech}^{2}\\left(\\frac{z}{w}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{w} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2w}\\text{sech}^{2}\\left(\\frac{z}{w}\\right)$$\nThe bound charge density is therefore:\n$$\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z) = -\\frac{dP(z)}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2w}\\text{sech}^{2}\\left(\\frac{z}{w}\\right)$$\nThis is a symmetric, bell-shaped charge distribution centered at $z=0$.\n\nNext, we justify that in the limit $w \\to 0^{+}$, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z)$ converges to a Dirac delta function. Convergence in the sense of distributions means that for any infinitely differentiable function $\\phi(z)$ that decays rapidly at infinity (a Schwartz function), the following limit holds:\n$$\\lim_{w \\to 0^{+}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z) \\phi(z) dz = C \\phi(0)$$\nfor some constant $C$. Let's evaluate this limit.\n$$I(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z) \\phi(z) dz = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta P}{2w}\\text{sech}^{2}\\left(\\frac{z}{w}\\right)\\right) \\phi(z) dz$$\nWe perform a change of variables, letting $u = z/w$. This implies $z=uw$ and $dz = w du$. The limits of integration remain $(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n$$I(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta P}{2w}\\text{sech}^{2}(u)\\right) \\phi(uw) (w du) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\text{sech}^{2}(u) \\phi(uw) du$$\nNow, we take the limit as $w \\to 0^{+}$. Since $\\phi(z)$ is a smooth function, $\\phi(uw) \\to \\phi(0)$ as $w \\to 0^{+}$. To rigorously justify interchanging the limit and the integral, we invoke the Dominated Convergence Theorem. The integrand is $f_w(u) = \\text{sech}^{2}(u)\\phi(uw)$. Since $\\phi$ is a rapidly decaying function, it is bounded, i.e., $|\\phi(z)| \\le M$ for some constant $M$. Thus, $|f_w(u)| \\le M \\text{sech}^{2}(u)$. The function $g(u) = M \\text{sech}^{2}(u)$ is integrable over $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. Therefore, we can bring the limit inside the integral:\n$$\\lim_{w \\to 0^{+}} I(w) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\lim_{w \\to 0^{+}} \\left[\\text{sech}^{2}(u) \\phi(uw)\\right] du = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\text{sech}^{2}(u) \\phi(0) du$$\n$$\\lim_{w \\to 0^{+}} I(w) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2} \\phi(0) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\text{sech}^{2}(u) du$$\nThe integral of $\\text{sech}^{2}(u)$ is $\\tanh(u)$:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\text{sech}^{2}(u) du = \\left[\\tanh(u)\\right]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = \\lim_{u \\to \\infty} \\tanh(u) - \\lim_{u \\to -\\infty} \\tanh(u) = 1 - (-1) = 2$$\nSubstituting this result back, we find the limit:\n$$\\lim_{w \\to 0^{+}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z) \\phi(z) dz = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2} \\phi(0) \\cdot 2 = -\\Delta P \\phi(0)$$\nBy definition, this shows that $\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z)$ converges to $-\\Delta P \\delta(z)$ in the sense of distributions.\nFor an abrupt interface at $z=0$, the bound sheet charge is given by $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{b}} = \\hat{n} \\cdot (\\mathbf{P}_{1} - \\mathbf{P}_{2})$, where $\\hat{n} = \\hat{z}$ is the normal from region $1$ ($z0$) to region $2$ ($z>0$), $\\mathbf{P}_{1}=P_1\\hat{z}$, and $\\mathbf{P}_{2}=P_2\\hat{z}$. This gives $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{b}} = P_{1} - P_{2} = -\\Delta P$.\nThe distributional limit thus yields a sheet charge of density $-\\Delta P$ at $z=0$, which exactly corresponds to the abrupt-interface sheet charge.\n\n**Part 2: Total bound charge per unit area**\n\nThe total bound charge per unit area, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is the integral of the volume charge density $\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z)$ over all $z$.\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z) dz = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{dP(z)}{dz}\\right) dz$$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}} = -[P(z)]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = -\\left(\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} P(z) - \\lim_{z \\to -\\infty} P(z)\\right)$$\nFrom the definition of $P(z)$, we have $\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} \\tanh(z/w) = 1$ and $\\lim_{z \\to -\\infty} \\tanh(z/w) = -1$.\nSo, $\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} P(z) = P_{1} + \\frac{\\Delta P}{2}(1+1) = P_1 + \\Delta P = P_1 + (P_2 - P_1) = P_2$.\nAnd, $\\lim_{z \\to -\\infty} P(z) = P_{1} + \\frac{\\Delta P}{2}(1-1) = P_1$.\nTherefore, the total charge per unit area is:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}} = -(P_{2} - P_{1}) = -\\Delta P$$\nThis confirms that the total integrated bound charge across the graded transition region is equal to the abrupt-interface sheet charge density $-\\Delta P$.\n\n**Part 3: Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of $|\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z)|$**\n\nThe magnitude of the bound charge density is:\n$$|\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z)| = \\left|-\\frac{\\Delta P}{2w}\\text{sech}^{2}\\left(\\frac{z}{w}\\right)\\right| = \\frac{|\\Delta P|}{2w}\\text{sech}^{2}\\left(\\frac{z}{w}\\right)$$\nThe function $\\text{sech}^{2}(u)$ has its maximum value of $1$ at $u=0$. Thus, the peak magnitude of the charge density occurs at $z=0$:\n$$|\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z)|_{\\text{peak}} = |\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(0)| = \\frac{|\\Delta P|}{2w}$$\nThe FWHM is the distance between the two points $\\pm z_{1/2}$ where the magnitude is one-half of its peak value. We set up the equation:\n$$|\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z_{1/2})| = \\frac{1}{2} |\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z)|_{\\text{peak}}$$\n$$\\frac{|\\Delta P|}{2w}\\text{sech}^{2}\\left(\\frac{z_{1/2}}{w}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{|\\Delta P|}{2w}\\right)$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\text{sech}^{2}\\left(\\frac{z_{1/2}}{w}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTaking the square root of both sides and inverting gives:\n$$\\cosh\\left(\\frac{|z_{1/2}|}{w}\\right) = \\sqrt{2}$$\nTo solve for the argument, we use the inverse hyperbolic cosine function, $\\text{arccosh}$. The identity for $\\text{arccosh}(x)$ is $\\ln(x + \\sqrt{x^2 - 1})$ for $x \\ge 1$.\n$$\\frac{|z_{1/2}|}{w} = \\text{arccosh}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\ln\\left(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{2})^2 - 1}\\right) = \\ln(\\sqrt{2} + 1)$$\nThus, the half-width is $|z_{1/2}| = w \\ln(\\sqrt{2} + 1)$. The FWHM is the full separation between the two half-maximum points $-z_{1/2}$ and $+z_{1/2}$:\n$$\\text{FWHM} = |z_{1/2} - (-z_{1/2})| = 2|z_{1/2}| = 2w \\ln(\\sqrt{2} + 1)$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the FWHM.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $w = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$\\text{FWHM} = 2 \\times (0.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}) \\times \\ln(\\sqrt{2} + 1) = 1.6 \\times \\ln(1.41421356... + 1) \\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\n$$\\text{FWHM} = 1.6 \\times \\ln(2.41421356...) \\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\n$$\\text{FWHM} = 1.6 \\times 0.88137358... \\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\n$$\\text{FWHM} \\approx 1.4101977... \\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $1.410\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.",
