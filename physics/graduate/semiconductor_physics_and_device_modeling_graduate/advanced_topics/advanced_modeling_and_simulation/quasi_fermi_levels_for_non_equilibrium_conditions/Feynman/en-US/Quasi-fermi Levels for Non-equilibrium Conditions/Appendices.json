All provided parameters and assumptions are standard for an introductory problem in semiconductor device physics, forming a self-consistent and solvable system.\n\nThe carrier concentrations for electrons, $n(x)$, and holes, $p(x)$, under non-equilibrium conditions are given in terms of the electron quasi-Fermi level $E_{Fn}(x)$, the hole quasi-Fermi level $E_{Fp}(x)$, and the intrinsic Fermi level $E_{i}(x)$:\n$$n(x) = n_{i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}(x) - E_{i}(x)}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\n$$p(x) = n_{i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{i}(x) - E_{Fp}(x)}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nwhere $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nBy multiplying these two expressions, we can relate the product of the carrier concentrations, $n(x)p(x)$, to the splitting between the quasi-Fermi levels:\n$$n(x)p(x) = \\left[n_{i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}(x) - E_{i}(x)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\right] \\left[n_{i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{i}(x) - E_{Fp}(x)}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\right]$$\n$$n(x)p(x) = n_{i}^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}(x) - E_{i}(x) + E_{i}(x) - E_{Fp}(x)}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\n$$n(x)p(x) = n_{i}^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}(x) - E_{Fp}(x)}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nThis fundamental equation holds at any position $x$. Our goal is to determine the energy splitting, $E_{Fn} - E_{Fp}$, at the edge of the depletion region. We can evaluate this expression at either edge, $x=0^{-}$ on the $p$-side or $x=0^{+}$ on the $n$-side. Let us choose the edge on the $n$-side, $x=0^{+}$.\n\nTo use the relation, we must determine the carrier concentrations $n(0^{+})$ and $p(0^{+})$.\nAt the edge of the depletion region on the $n$-side, the semiconductor is quasi-neutral. Under the stated condition of low injection, the injected minority carrier concentration (holes) is much smaller than the majority carrier concentration (electrons). Therefore, the majority carrier concentration is approximately equal to the net donor doping density, $N_{D}$:\n$$n(0^{+}) \\approx N_{D}$$\nThe minority carrier concentration at this boundary under a forward bias $V$ is given by the law of the junction. This law states that the minority carrier concentration at the edge of the depletion region is the equilibrium minority carrier concentration multiplied by an exponential factor dependent on the applied voltage. The equilibrium minority hole concentration in the $n$-type material is $p_{n0}$:\n$$p_{n0} = \\frac{n_{i}^2}{N_{D}}$$\nUnder a forward bias voltage $V$, the minority carrier concentration at $x=0^{+}$ becomes:\n$$p(0^{+}) = p_{n}(0^{+}) = p_{n0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_{B} T}\\right) = \\frac{n_{i}^2}{N_{D}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nThis expression provides the first requested quantity, the minority carrier density at the $n$-side edge of the depletion region. For completeness, the minority carrier density at the $p$-side edge ($x = 0^{-}$) is similarly given by $n_{p}(0^{-}) = n_{p0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_{B} T}\\right) = \\frac{n_{i}^2}{N_{A}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_{B} T}\\right)$, where $N_{A}$ is the acceptor doping density.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $n(0^{+})$ and $p(0^{+})$ into the general $np$ product equation evaluated at $x=0^{+}$:\n$$n(0^{+})p(0^{+}) = n_{i}^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}(0^{+}) - E_{Fp}(0^{+})}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\n$$N_{D} \\left(\\frac{n_{i}^2}{N_{D}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\right) = n_{i}^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}(0^{+}) - E_{Fp}(0^{+})}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nThe doping concentration $N_{D}$ cancels out:\n$$n_{i}^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_{B} T}\\right) = n_{i}^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}(0^{+}) - E_{Fp}(0^{+})}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nDividing both sides by $n_{i}^2$ and taking the natural logarithm yields:\n$$\\frac{qV}{k_{B} T} = \\frac{E_{Fn}(0^{+}) - E_{Fp}(0^{+})}{k_{B} T}$$\nThus, the energy splitting between the quasi-Fermi levels at the depletion region edge is:\n$$E_{Fn}(0^{+}) - E_{Fp}(0^{+}) = qV$$\nA similar analysis at the $p$-side edge, $x=0^{-}$, using $p(0^{-}) \\approx N_{A}$ and $n(0^{-}) = \\frac{n_{i}^2}{N_{A}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_{B} T}\\right)$, yields the same result: $E_{Fn}(0^{-}) - E_{Fp}(0^{-}) = qV$. This confirms that under the assumption of negligible recombination-generation in the depletion region, the splitting of the quasi-Fermi levels is constant and equal to $qV$ throughout this region.\n\nThe problem asks for this energy splitting to be expressed in electron-volts (eV). The energy splitting is $qV$. Given an applied voltage $V = 0.65 \\,\\mathrm{V}$, the energy is:\n$$\\text{Energy Splitting} = q \\times (0.65 \\,\\mathrm{V})$$\nBy definition, one electron-volt ($1 \\,\\mathrm{eV}$) is the energy equal to the elementary charge $q$ multiplied by one volt ($1 \\,\\mathrm{V}$). Therefore, the energy splitting in electron-volts is numerically equal to the applied voltage in volts.\n$$\\text{Energy Splitting} = 0.65 \\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{Energy Splitting} = 0.6500 \\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nThe values of $N_{A}$, $N_{D}$, $n_{i}$, and $T$ are consistent with the low-injection assumption but are not required for the final calculation of the energy splitting.",

            "introduction": "The ideal diode equation, with its ideality factor of unity, is a powerful but simplified model. Real diodes often exhibit more complex behavior, especially under high forward bias. This deviation from ideality is not merely an empirical observation but is rooted in the fundamental physics of carrier injection and charge neutrality. This practice challenges you to move beyond the low-injection assumption explored in the previous problem  and analyze the high-injection regime, where the injected carrier density surpasses the background doping. By deriving the resulting ideality factor, you will gain a deeper physical insight into how the operating conditions alter the relationship between voltage, quasi-Fermi levels, and current, a crucial concept in accurate device modeling.",

            "problem": "A uniformly doped planar $p$-$n$ junction diode of cross-sectional area $A$ is operated under steady forward bias voltage $V$ at temperature $T$. The $p$-region ($x<0$) is lightly doped with acceptor density $N_A$, and the $n$-region ($x>0$) is heavily doped with donor density $N_D$, with $N_D \\gg N_A$ so that carrier injection predominately occurs into the $p$-region. Assume one-dimensional (1D) transport along $x$, negligible generation and recombination inside the depletion region, and that recombination in the quasi-neutral regions is governed by a single bulk lifetime $\\tau$ independent of carrier density. Assume constant electron and hole mobilities $\\mu_n$ and $\\mu_p$ satisfying the Einstein relations $D_n = \\mu_n k_B T / q$ and $D_p = \\mu_p k_B T / q$, where $D_n$ and $D_p$ are diffusion coefficients, $k_B$ is Boltzmann’s constant, and $q$ is the elementary charge.\n\nDefine quasi-Fermi levels $E_{Fn}(x)$ and $E_{Fp}(x)$ for electrons and holes, respectively, by the relations $n(x) = N_C \\exp\\!\\big(-(E_C(x) - E_{Fn}(x))/k_B T\\big)$ and $p(x) = N_V \\exp\\!\\big(-(E_{Fp}(x) - E_V(x))/k_B T\\big)$, where $E_C(x)$ and $E_V(x)$ are the conduction and valence band edge energies and $N_C$ and $N_V$ are the effective densities of states, all assumed spatially uniform within each quasi-neutral region.

Your derivation should explicitly show how the injected boundary carrier concentrations scale with $E_{Fn} - E_{Fp}$ under (i) low-level injection, where $p \\approx N_A$ remains approximately fixed, and (ii) high-level injection, where local charge neutrality enforces $p \\approx n \\gg N_A$ in the injected region.\n\nUsing these scalings, argue the corresponding exponential dependence of $J$ on the applied bias $V$ in each regime, and thereby identify the ideality factor $n$ (defined by the local slope $n \\equiv \\frac{q}{k_B T} \\frac{d V}{d \\ln J}$) in the high-level injection regime.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the ideality factor $n$ of a one-sided $p$-$n$ junction diode under high-level injection (HLI), neglecting recombination in the space-charge region (SCR). The ideality factor is defined by the relation $J \\propto \\exp(qV/(n k_B T))$, or more formally as $n \\equiv \\frac{q}{k_B T} \\frac{dV}{d\\ln J}$.\n\nThe analysis begins by relating the carrier concentrations at the edge of the depletion region to the applied voltage $V$. The non-equilibrium mass-action relation, also known as the law of the junction, connects the electron and hole concentrations, $n(x)$ and $p(x)$, at any point $x$ to the separation of the quasi-Fermi levels, $E_{Fn}(x) - E_{Fp}(x)$. At the boundaries of the depletion region, located at $x_n$ on the $n$-side and $-x_p$ on the $p$-side, the quasi-Fermi level separation is approximately equal to the electrical potential energy difference imparted by the junction voltage, $qV_j$. Assuming that the voltage drop across the quasi-neutral regions (QNRs) is small compared to the drop across the junction, we can approximate $V_j \\approx V$. Thus, at the depletion edge on the $p$-side ($x=-x_p$), we have:\n$$n(-x_p) p(-x_p) = n_i^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}(-x_p) - E_{Fp}(-x_p)}{k_B T}\\right) \\approx n_i^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration, $q$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nNext, we apply the condition of high-level injection in the lightly doped $p$-region. HLI is defined by the condition that the injected minority carrier concentration (electrons in the $p$-region) is much larger than the majority carrier concentration at equilibrium. In our case, this means the excess electron density $\\Delta n = n - n_{p0}$ is much greater than the acceptor doping density $N_A$, where $n_{p0} = n_i^2/N_A$ is the equilibrium electron density. The total electron concentration at the depletion edge is $n(-x_p)$. The HLI condition is $n(-x_p) \\gg N_A$.\n\nIn the quasi-neutral $p$-region, local charge neutrality must be maintained. The total positive charge density (holes and ionized donors) must equal the total negative charge density (electrons and ionized acceptors). We assume full ionization, so the neutrality condition is $p(x) + N_D^+ = n(x) + N_A^-$. In the $p$-QNR, $N_D^+=0$, so $p(x) = n(x) + N_A$. In terms of excess carriers, where $n(x) = n_{p0} + \\Delta n(x)$ and $p(x) = p_{p0} + \\Delta p(x) \\approx N_A + \\Delta p(x)$, neutrality requires $\\Delta n(x) = \\Delta p(x)$. Thus, $p(x) \\approx N_A + \\Delta n(x) = N_A + n(x) - n_{p0}$.\n\nAt the depletion edge $x=-x_p$ under HLI, since $n(-x_p) \\gg N_A$ and $N_A \\gg n_{p0}$, the neutrality condition simplifies to:\n$$p(-x_p) \\approx n(-x_p)$$\nSubstituting this HLI neutrality condition into the law of the junction gives:\n$$n(-x_p) \\cdot n(-x_p) \\approx n_i^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nSolving for the injected electron concentration at the boundary yields:\n$$n(-x_p) \\approx n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{2 k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis equation shows that under HLI, the boundary concentration of injected carriers is proportional to $\\exp(qV/(2k_BT))$. This is in contrast to the low-level injection case where $p(-x_p) \\approx N_A$, which leads to $n(-x_p) \\propto \\exp(qV/(k_BT))$. The factor of $2$ in the denominator for the HLI case is the origin of the ideality factor of $2$.\n\nTo complete the argument, we must relate the total current density $J$ to this boundary concentration $n(-x_p)$. Since the junction is one-sided ($N_D \\gg N_A$), injection into the heavily doped $n$-region is negligible. The total current is therefore dominated by the recombination of electrons injected into the $p$-region. This current is equal to the electron current density entering the $p$-QNR at $x=-x_p$, so $J \\approx J_n(-x_p)$.\n\nUnder HLI ($n \\approx p$), the transport of excess carriers in the QNR is governed by ambipolar diffusion and drift. The electron current density $J_n$ can be expressed in terms of the total current density $J$ and the carrier concentration gradient as:\n$$J_n(x) = \\frac{\\mu_n n}{\\mu_n n + \\mu_p p} J + q D_{eff} \\frac{dn}{dx}$$\nIn HLI, with $n(x) \\approx p(x)$, this simplifies to:\n$$J_n(x) = \\frac{\\mu_n}{\\mu_n + \\mu_p} J + q D_a \\frac{dn}{dx}$$\nwhere $D_a = \\frac{2 D_n D_p}{D_n + D_p} = \\frac{2 \\mu_n \\mu_p}{\\mu_n + \\mu_p} \\frac{k_B T}{q}$ is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient.\n\nThe steady-state continuity equation for electrons in the $p$-QNR is $\\frac{1}{q} \\frac{dJ_n}{dx} = U_n = \\frac{n-n_{p0}}{\\tau}$. Taking the derivative of the expression for $J_n(x)$ and assuming $J$ is constant gives $\\frac{dJ_n}{dx} = q D_a \\frac{d^2n}{dx^2}$. Equating the two gives the ambipolar diffusion equation:\n$$D_a \\frac{d^2n}{dx^2} = \\frac{n-n_{p0}}{\\tau} \\approx \\frac{n}{\\tau} \\quad (\\text{in HLI})$$\nLetting $L_a = \\sqrt{D_a\\tau}$ be the ambipolar diffusion length, we have $\\frac{d^2n}{dx^2} = \\frac{n}{L_a^2}$. For the semi-infinite $p$-region (from $x=-x_p$ to $x \\to -\\infty$), the solution that decays far from the junction is $n(x) = n(-x_p) \\exp((x+x_p)/L_a)$. The gradient at the boundary is $\\left.\\frac{dn}{dx}\\right|_{x=-x_p} = \\frac{n(-x_p)}{L_a}$.\n\nWe can now find the total current $J$ by evaluating $J \\approx J_n(-x_p)$:\n$$J \\approx \\frac{\\mu_n}{\\mu_n + \\mu_p} J + q D_a \\left(\\frac{n(-x_p)}{L_a}\\right)$$\nSolving for $J$:\n$$J \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu_n}{\\mu_n + \\mu_p}\\right) = \\frac{q D_a}{L_a} n(-x_p)$$\n$$J \\left(\\frac{\\mu_p}{\\mu_n + \\mu_p}\\right) = \\frac{q D_a}{L_a} n(-x_p)$$\n$$J = \\left(\\frac{\\mu_n + \\mu_p}{\\mu_p}\\right) \\frac{q D_a}{L_a} n(-x_p)$$\nThis result establishes that the total current density $J$ is directly proportional to the injected carrier concentration at the boundary, $n(-x_p)$:\n$$J \\propto n(-x_p)$$\n\nCombining our two key findings:\n1. $n(-x_p) \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{2k_BT}\\right)$\n2. $J \\propto n(-x_p)$\n\nWe conclude that the total current density has the following dependence on the applied voltage:\n$$J \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{2 k_B T}\\right)$$\nComparing this to the generalized diode equation form $J \\propto \\exp(qV/(n k_B T))$, we identify the ideality factor $n$ for high-level injection.\n\nAlternatively, using the formal definition of the ideality factor:\n$$n = \\frac{q}{k_B T} \\left(\\frac{dV}{d\\ln J}\\right)$$\nFrom $J = C \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{2 k_B T}\\right)$ for some constant $C$, we have $\\ln J = \\ln C + \\frac{qV}{2 k_B T}$.\nDifferentiating with respect to $V$ gives $\\frac{d\\ln J}{dV} = \\frac{q}{2 k_B T}$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{dV}{d\\ln J} = \\frac{2 k_B T}{q}$.\nSubstituting this into the definition for $n$:\n$$n = \\frac{q}{k_B T} \\left(\\frac{2 k_B T}{q}\\right) = 2$$\nThe ideality factor in the high-level injection regime, under the given assumptions, is $2$.",

Let's use the hole current $J_p$:\n$$\nJ_p = q p \\mu_p \\left( \\frac{D_p - D_n}{n \\mu_n + p \\mu_p} \\frac{\\partial(\\delta n)}{\\partial x} \\right) - q D_p \\frac{\\partial(\\delta n)}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\nJ_p = -q \\left( D_p - \\frac{p \\mu_p (D_p - D_n)}{n \\mu_n + p \\mu_p} \\right) \\frac{\\partial(\\delta n)}{\\partial x}\n$$\nFactoring out terms in the parenthesis, we get:\n$$\nJ_p = -q \\left( \\frac{D_p (n \\mu_n + p \\mu_p) - p \\mu_p (D_p - D_n)}{n \\mu_n + p \\mu_p} \\right) \\frac{\\partial(\\delta n)}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\nJ_p = -q \\left( \\frac{n \\mu_n D_p + p \\mu_p D_p - p \\mu_p D_p + p \\mu_p D_n}{n \\mu_n + p \\mu_p} \\right) \\frac{\\partial(\\delta n)}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\nJ_p = -q \\left( \\frac{n \\mu_n D_p + p \\mu_p D_n}{n \\mu_n + p \\mu_p} \\right) \\frac{\\partial(\\delta n)}{\\partial x}\n$$\nWe identify the term in the parenthesis as the ambipolar diffusion coefficient, $D_a$:\n$$\nD_a = \\frac{n \\mu_n D_p + p \\mu_p D_n}{n \\mu_n + p \\mu_p}\n$$\nThe problem operates in the low-level injection regime for an n-type semiconductor, where $n \\approx n_0$ and $\\delta n \\ll n_0$. In this limit, $D_a$ can be treated as a constant, approximately equal to the minority carrier (hole) diffusion coefficient, $D_p$. The problem asks to express the result in terms of $D_a$, so we treat it as a given constant parameter. The hole current is thus $J_p = -q D_a \\frac{\\partial(\\delta n)}{\\partial x}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the hole continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(\\delta n)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{q} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-q D_a \\frac{\\partial(\\delta n)}{\\partial x}\\right) - \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(\\delta n)}{\\partial t} = D_a \\frac{\\partial^2(\\delta n)}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\delta n}{\\tau}\n$$\nThis is the ambipolar diffusion equation, which governs the dynamics of the excess carrier population $\\delta n(t,x)$.\n\nNext, we relate the excess carrier density $\\delta n$ to the quasi-Fermi levels $E_{Fn}$ and $E_{Fp}$. The Maxwell-Boltzmann relations are $n=n_i\\exp[(E_{Fn}-E_i)/(k_B T)]$ and $p=n_i\\exp[(E_i-E_{Fp})/(k_B T)]$.\nLet $E_{F0}$ be the equilibrium Fermi level. Then $n_0 = n_i\\exp[(E_{F0}-E_i)/(k_B T)]$ and $p_0 = n_i\\exp[(E_i-E_{F0})/(k_B T)]$.\nUnder illumination, $n = n_0+\\delta n$ and $p=p_0+\\delta n$. We can write:\n$$\nn = n_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn} - E_{F0}}{k_B T}\\right) \\quad \\implies \\quad n_0 + \\delta n = n_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn} - E_{F0}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\np = p_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{Fp} - E_{F0}}{k_B T}\\right) \\quad \\implies \\quad p_0 + \\delta n = p_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{Fp} - E_{F0}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nFor small perturbations (low-level injection), we can linearize the exponential function $\\exp(u) \\approx 1+u$:\n$$\nn_0 + \\delta n \\approx n_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{E_{Fn} - E_{F0}}{k_B T}\\right) \\implies \\delta n \\approx \\frac{n_0}{k_B T}(E_{Fn} - E_{F0})\n$$\n$$\np_0 + \\delta n \\approx p_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{E_{Fp} - E_{F0}}{k_B T}\\right) \\implies \\delta n \\approx -\\frac{p_0}{k_B T}(E_{Fp} - E_{F0})\n$$\nLet $\\delta E_{Fn} = E_{Fn} - E_{F0}$ and $\\delta E_{Fp} = E_{Fp} - E_{F0}$ be the small perturbations of the quasi-Fermi levels from equilibrium. We have a linear relationship between $\\delta n$ and these perturbations. Since $n_0, p_0, k_B, T$ are constants, we can substitute these relations into the ambipolar diffusion equation. For the electron quasi-Fermi level perturbation $\\delta E_{Fn}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\frac{n_0}{k_B T} \\delta E_{Fn}\\right) = D_a \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\left(\\frac{n_0}{k_B T} \\delta E_{Fn}\\right) - \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\left(\\frac{n_0}{k_B T} \\delta E_{Fn}\\right)\n$$\nThe constant factor cancels, yielding the evolution equation for $\\delta E_{Fn}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(\\delta E_{Fn})}{\\partial t} = D_a \\frac{\\partial^2(\\delta E_{Fn})}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\delta E_{Fn}}{\\tau}\n$$\nSince $E_{F0}$ is constant, the evolution equation for the full quasi-Fermi level $E_{Fn} = E_{F0} + \\delta E_{Fn}$ is $\\frac{\\partial E_{Fn}}{\\partial t} = D_a \\frac{\\partial^2 E_{Fn}}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{E_{Fn}-E_{F0}}{\\tau}$. A similar derivation holds for $E_{Fp}$. The problem asks for the linear equations for small perturbations, which are the homogeneous PDEs derived for $\\delta E_{Fn}$ and $\\delta E_{Fp}$.\n\nTo find the decay timescales, we solve this PDE using separation of variables. Let $\\Psi(t,x)$ represent either $\\delta E_{Fn}(t,x)$ or $\\delta E_{Fp}(t,x)$. The boundary conditions $\\Delta n(t,0) = \\Delta n(t,L)=0$ imply $\\Psi(t,0) = \\Psi(t,L) = 0$.\nLet $\\Psi(t,x) = T(t)X(x)$. Substituting into the PDE gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T}\\frac{dT}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} = D_a\\frac{1}{X}\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -\\lambda\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a separation constant. The spatial part is $X''(x) + \\frac{\\lambda}{D_a}X(x) = 0$ with $X(0)=X(L)=0$. The non-trivial solutions are eigenfunctions $X_m(x) = \\sin(k_m x)$ with eigenvalues $k_m = \\frac{m\\pi}{L}$ for integer $m=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. The separation constants are $\\lambda_m = D_a k_m^2 = D_a\\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$.\n\nThe temporal part is $\\frac{dT}{dt} = -(\\lambda_m + \\frac{1}{\\tau})T$. The solution is an exponential decay $T_m(t) \\propto \\exp(-t/\\tau_m)$, where the decay time constant $\\tau_m$ for each mode $m$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_m} = \\lambda_m + \\frac{1}{\\tau} = D_a\\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe discrete set of decay timescales is therefore:\n$$\n\\tau_m = \\left(D_a\\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)^{-1}, \\quad m=1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n$$\nEach timescale corresponds to the decay of a specific spatial mode of the excess carrier distribution and hence of the quasi-Fermi level perturbations.\n\nThe dominant (slowest) decay time constant corresponds to the smallest decay rate $1/\\tau_m$. This occurs for the smallest value of $m$, which is $m=1$. The fundamental mode has the longest lifetime because it has the smallest spatial gradient, minimizing loss due to diffusion to the surfaces. Setting $m=1$, we find the dominant time constant $\\tau_1$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{dominant}} = \\tau_1 = \\left( D_a \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThis expression is in terms of the required parameters $D_a$, $L$, and $\\tau$.",
