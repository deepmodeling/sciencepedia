            "solution": "The problem statement is a standard exercise in semiconductor device physics, asking for the derivation of the threshold voltage of a long-channel MOSFET, including the body effect. All parameters are well-defined, the physical model (depletion approximation, 1D electrostatics) is standard, and the required steps are clearly outlined. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. Therefore, the problem is valid and we may proceed with the derivation from first principles as requested.\n\nLet $x$ be the coordinate normal to the gate oxide/semiconductor interface, with $x=0$ at the interface and $x0$ into the $p$-type silicon body. The source is held at a potential of $0$ volts, and a reverse bias $V_{SB} \\ge 0$ is applied to the body, setting its potential far from the interface to $-V_{SB}$.\n\nUnder the depletion approximation, for a gate voltage sufficient to create a depletion region but below threshold, the region $0  x  W_d$ is depleted of mobile holes, leaving a net space charge density of ionized acceptors, $\\rho(x) = -qN_A$. Here, $W_d$ is the depletion width, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $N_A$ is the acceptor concentration. For $x  W_d$, the semiconductor is neutral.\n\nThe one-dimensional Poisson's equation in the depletion region is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_s} = \\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}\n$$\nwhere $\\psi(x)$ is the electrostatic potential and $\\epsilon_s$ is the permittivity of silicon.\n\nWe integrate this equation once with respect to $x$ to find the electric field, $E(x) = -\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}$. The boundary condition at the edge of the depletion region is that the electric field must vanish: $E(W_d) = 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\psi}{dx} = \\int_{W_d}^{x} \\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s} dx' = \\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}(x - W_d)\n$$\nThus, the electric field is $E(x) = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}(x - W_d)$.\n\nWe integrate a second time to find the potential $\\psi(x)$. The potential at the edge of the depletion region is that of the neutral bulk, $\\psi(W_d) = -V_{SB}$.\n$$\n\\psi(x) - \\psi(W_d) = \\int_{W_d}^{x} \\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}(x' - W_d) dx' = \\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s} \\left[ \\frac{x'^2}{2} - W_d x' \\right]_{W_d}^{x}\n$$\n$$\n\\psi(x) - (-V_{SB}) = \\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s} \\left( \\left(\\frac{x^2}{2} - W_d x \\right) - \\left(\\frac{W_d^2}{2} - W_d^2 \\right) \\right) = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\epsilon_s}(x^2 - 2W_d x + W_d^2) = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\epsilon_s}(x-W_d)^2\n$$\nSo, the potential profile is $\\psi(x) = -V_{SB} + \\frac{qN_A}{2\\epsilon_s}(W_d-x)^2$.\n\nThe potential at the silicon surface ($x=0$) is $\\psi_s^{\\text{abs}} = \\psi(0) = -V_{SB} + \\frac{qN_A W_d^2}{2\\epsilon_s}$.\nThe potential drop across the depletion region, also known as the surface-to-bulk potential or band bending, is $\\psi_s = \\psi(0) - \\psi(W_d) = \\left(-V_{SB} + \\frac{qN_A W_d^2}{2\\epsilon_s}\\right) - (-V_{SB}) = \\frac{qN_A W_d^2}{2\\epsilon_s}$.\n\nThe condition for the onset of strong inversion is that the total band bending equals $2\\phi_F$, where $\\phi_F$ is the bulk Fermi potential. However, the presence of the reverse source-body bias $V_{SB}$ adds to the potential that must be supported by the depletion region. The potential of the inversion layer (channel) is tied to the source, which is at $0$ volts. The potential of the bulk is $-V_{SB}$. The total potential difference across the space-charge region at threshold is the sum of the potential required for strong inversion ($2\\phi_F$) and the applied reverse bias ($V_{SB}$).\nTherefore, at threshold, the total potential drop across the depletion region is $2\\phi_F + V_{SB}$.\nEquating this to our derived expression:\n$$\n\\frac{qN_A W_{d,th}^2}{2\\epsilon_s} = 2\\phi_F + V_{SB}\n$$\nwhere $W_{d,th}$ is the depletion width at threshold. Solving for $W_{d,th}$:\n$$\nW_{d,th} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_s(2\\phi_F + V_{SB})}{qN_A}}\n$$\nThe total charge per unit area in the depletion region at threshold, $Q_{d,th}$, is due to the negatively ionized acceptors:\n$$\nQ_{d,th} = -qN_A W_{d,th} = -qN_A \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_s(2\\phi_F + V_{SB})}{qN_A}} = -\\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_s N_A(2\\phi_F + V_{SB})}\n$$\nNow, we write the voltage balance equation for the MOS capacitor, relating the gate-source voltage $V_{GS}$ to the internal potentials. The applied gate voltage is distributed across the flat-band voltage component $V_{FB}$, the voltage drop across the gate oxide $V_{ox}$, and the potential drop across the silicon (band bending), $\\psi_s$.\n$$\nV_{GS} = V_{FB} + \\psi_s + V_{ox}\n$$\nAt threshold, $V_{GS} = V_{th}$ and the band bending required for strong inversion is $\\psi_s = 2\\phi_F$. The voltage across the oxide is related to the total charge stored in the silicon $Q_{si}$ by $V_{ox} = -Q_{si}/C_{ox}$, where $C_{ox}$ is the oxide capacitance per unit area. As per the problem statement, we neglect the mobile inversion charge at threshold, so the total silicon charge is approximated by the depletion charge, $Q_{si} \\approx Q_{d,th}$.\nSubstituting these conditions into the voltage balance equation:\n$$\nV_{th} = V_{FB} + 2\\phi_F - \\frac{Q_{d,th}}{C_{ox}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $Q_{d,th}$:\n$$\nV_{th} = V_{FB} + 2\\phi_F - \\frac{-\\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_s N_A(2\\phi_F + V_{SB})}}{C_{ox}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the threshold voltage as a function of the source-body bias:\n$$\nV_{th}(V_{SB}) = V_{FB} + 2\\phi_F + \\frac{\\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_s N_A(2\\phi_F + V_{SB})}}{C_{ox}}\n$$\nThis equation shows the threshold voltage is the sum of the flat-band voltage, the surface potential for strong inversion, and a term representing the body effect, which increases the threshold voltage as the reverse source-body bias $V_{SB}$ is increased. The final expression is in terms of the specified parameters.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the threshold voltage sensitivity, $\\frac{\\partial V_{th}}{\\partial V_{SB}}$, for a long-channel n-MOSFET. The derivation must start from the provided quasi-static relations and definitions. Subsequently, the bias dependence of this sensitivity must be analyzed.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the threshold voltage, $V_{th}$, as a function of the source-to-body bias, $V_{SB}$. The problem provides the fundamental relationship between the gate voltage $V_G$, flat-band voltage $V_{FB}$, surface potential $\\psi_s$, and depletion charge magnitude $|Q_d|$:\n$$V_{G} - V_{FB} = \\psi_{s} + \\frac{|Q_{d}|}{C_{ox}}$$\nThis equation is evaluated at the threshold of strong inversion, where by definition $V_G = V_{th}$. The condition for strong inversion is given as the surface potential reaching a value of $\\psi_{s} = 2\\phi_{F}$, where $\\phi_{F}$ is the Fermi potential. Substituting these conditions into the equation yields:\n$$V_{th} = V_{FB} + 2\\phi_{F} + \\frac{|Q_{d}|}{C_{ox}}$$\nThe problem also provides the expression for the magnitude of the depletion charge per unit area at the onset of strong inversion:\n$$|Q_{d}| = \\sqrt{2\\epsilon_{si}qN_{A}(\\psi_{s} + V_{SB})}$$\nAt threshold, we must use the surface potential condition $\\psi_{s} = 2\\phi_{F}$. Substituting this into the expression for $|Q_d|$ gives the depletion charge at threshold:\n$$|Q_{d}|_{th} = \\sqrt{2\\epsilon_{si}qN_{A}(2\\phi_{F} + V_{SB})}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for the threshold depletion charge back into the equation for $V_{th}$:\n$$V_{th}(V_{SB}) = V_{FB} + 2\\phi_{F} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\epsilon_{si}qN_{A}(2\\phi_{F} + V_{SB})}}{C_{ox}}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we use the definition of the body-effect coefficient, $\\gamma$, provided in the problem statement:\n$$\\gamma \\equiv \\frac{\\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_{si}N_{A}}}{C_{ox}}$$\nUsing this definition, the term involving the square root in the $V_{th}$ expression can be rewritten as:\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\epsilon_{si}qN_{A}}}{C_{ox}} \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{SB}} = \\gamma \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{SB}}$$\nThis leads to the final expression for the threshold voltage as a function of $V_{SB}$:\n$$V_{th}(V_{SB}) = V_{FB} + 2\\phi_{F} + \\gamma \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{SB}}$$\nThis equation describes the body effect, which is the increase in threshold voltage with increasing reverse source-to-body bias.\n\nNext, we compute the sensitivity of the threshold voltage with respect to the source-to-body bias, which is the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial V_{th}}{\\partial V_{SB}}$. We differentiate the expression for $V_{th}(V_{SB})$ with respect to $V_{SB}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial V_{th}}{\\partial V_{SB}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{SB}} \\left( V_{FB} + 2\\phi_{F} + \\gamma \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{SB}} \\right)$$\nThe flat-band voltage $V_{FB}$, the Fermi potential $\\phi_{F}$, and the body-effect coefficient $\\gamma$ are functions of material properties, device geometry, and doping concentration, but they do not depend on the applied bias $V_{SB}$.

The parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\phi_{F}$ are positive for a standard n-channel MOSFET on a p-type substrate. The problem specifies a non-negative source-to-body bias, $V_{SB} \\geq 0$. Consequently, the term in the denominator, $2\\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{SB}}$, is always a positive real number. This implies that the sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial V_{th}}{\\partial V_{SB}}$ is always positive, correctly reflecting that $V_{th}$ increases as $V_{SB}$ increases (body effect).\n\nThe dependence on $V_{SB}$ is seen in the denominator. As $V_{SB}$ increases from $0$, the value of the term $\\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{SB}}$ increases. Since this term is in the denominator of the sensitivity expression, the overall value of $\\frac{\\partial V_{th}}{\\partial V_{SB}}$ decreases as $V_{SB}$ increases. The sensitivity is largest at $V_{SB}=0$, with a value of $\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}}}$, and diminishes for larger reverse biases. Physically, this means that while the threshold voltage continues to rise with increasing $V_{SB}$, it does so at a progressively slower rate. The body bias is most effective at modulating $V_{th}$ near zero bias and becomes less effective at higher biases.",

The language is objective and the parameters are physically realistic.\n\nThe solution proceeds by establishing the charge balance equation for the FDSOI device structure under the given assumptions.

Let's define the flat-band voltages for the front and back gates as $V_{FB,f}$ and $V_{FB,b}$, respectively. The voltage drop across the front oxide is $(V_G - V_{FB,f} - \\phi_s)$, and across the back oxide is $(V_{BG} - V_{FB,b} - \\phi_s)$.\nThe charges stored on the gates per unit area are:\n$$Q_G = C_{ox}(V_G - V_{FB,f} - \\phi_s)$$\n$$Q_{BG} = C_{box}(V_{BG} - V_{FB,b} - \\phi_s)$$\nSubstituting these expressions and $Q_{si}$ into the charge neutrality equation:\n$$C_{ox}(V_G - V_{FB,f} - \\phi_s) + C_{box}(V_{BG} - V_{FB,b} - \\phi_s) + (-q N_A t_{si}) = 0$$\nThis equation describes the electrostatic equilibrium of the device.\n\nThe problem defines the threshold condition as the point where the front-gate voltage is the threshold voltage, $V_G = V_{th}$, and the front surface potential reaches $2\\phi_F$.
