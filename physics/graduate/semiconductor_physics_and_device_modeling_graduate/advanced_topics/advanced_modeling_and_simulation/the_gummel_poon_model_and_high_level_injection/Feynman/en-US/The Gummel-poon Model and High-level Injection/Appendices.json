            "problem": "A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) in forward active operation can be modeled using the Gummel-Poon charge-control framework, which relates the stored base charge to the terminal voltages and currents. Let the stored charge in the base under forward bias be denoted by $Q_{B}(V_{BE})$, where $V_{BE}$ is the base-emitter voltage. In the quasi-static small-signal regime, the base-emitter diffusion capacitance is defined by the slope of the stored charge with respect to the applied voltage, namely $C_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE})$ is the derivative $\\mathrm{d}Q_{B}/\\mathrm{d}V_{BE}$.\n\nStarting from first principles consistent with the Gummel-Poon picture and semiconductor transport, do the following:\n\n- Using the quasi-static definition of small-signal capacitance and the charge-control concept that associates stored charge $Q_{B}(V_{BE})$ with the transport time of carriers through the base, derive the general expression for the base-emitter diffusion capacitance $C_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE})$ in terms of $Q_{B}(V_{BE})$.\n- Then, specialize to the low-level injection case at temperature $T$ where the forward transit time $\\tau_{F}$ is independent of current and voltage, and the collector current is $I_{C}(V_{BE}) = I_{S} \\exp(V_{BE}/V_{T})$ with $I_{S}$ the scale current and $V_{T} = k_{B}T/q$ the thermal voltage (with $k_{B}$ the Boltzmann constant and $q$ the elementary charge).

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the base-emitter diffusion capacitance, $C_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}$, for a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). The solution will be developed in two stages as requested: first, a general expression will be derived from first principles, and second, this will be specialized to the case of low-level injection under a specific set of assumptions.\n\nThe fundamental starting point is the quasi-static definition of the small-signal diffusion capacitance, which relates the change in stored charge, $Q_B$, to the change in the applied voltage, $V_{BE}$:\n$$\nC_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE}) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q_{B}}{\\mathrm{d}V_{BE}}\n$$\n\n**Part 1: General Expression for Diffusion Capacitance**\n\nThe first task is to derive a general expression for $C_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE})$ in terms of the stored charge $Q_{B}(V_{BE})$ itself. To achieve this, we must posit a functional form for $Q_{B}(V_{BE})$ that is grounded in the fundamental physics of a p-n junction.\n\nThe stored charge $Q_B$ consists of excess minority carriers injected into the base region. The concentration of these carriers at the edge of the base-emitter space-charge region is governed by the law of the junction. This law dictates that the excess minority carrier concentration is proportional to $\\exp(V_{BE}/(n V_T)) - 1$, where $V_T = k_B T / q$ is the thermal voltage, and $n$ is the forward current emission coefficient (or ideality factor), which accounts for the injection level and recombination mechanisms. For low-level injection, $n \\approx 1$, while for high-level injection, $n \\approx 2$.\n\nThe total stored base charge $Q_B$ is obtained by integrating the excess minority carrier concentration profile over the neutral base volume. As this charge is directly proportional to the boundary concentration, its dependence on $V_{BE}$ follows the same form. We can thus write a general expression for the stored charge as:\n$$\nQ_B(V_{BE}) = Q_{B,S} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{n V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nwhere $Q_{B,S}$ is a scaling constant representing the stored charge extrapolated to reverse bias. This expression is consistent with the charge-control picture of the Gummel-Poon model.\n\nNow, we can compute the diffusion capacitance by differentiating this expression for $Q_B(V_{BE})$ with respect to $V_{BE}$:\n$$\nC_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE}) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}V_{BE}} \\left[ Q_{B,S} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{n V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nC_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE}) = Q_{B,S} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n V_T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{n V_T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for this expression to be in terms of $Q_B(V_{BE})$. We can rearrange the equation for $Q_B$ to solve for the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{n V_T}\\right) = \\frac{Q_B(V_{BE})}{Q_{B,S}} + 1\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $C_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE})$ yields the desired general form:\n$$\nC_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE}) = Q_{B,S} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n V_T} \\left( \\frac{Q_B(V_{BE})}{Q_{B,S}} + 1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nC_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE}) = \\frac{Q_B(V_{BE}) + Q_{B,S}}{n V_T}\n$$\nThis is a general expression for the diffusion capacitance in terms of the stored charge $Q_B$.\n\n**Part 2: Specialization to Low-Level Injection**\n\nThe second task is to compute the explicit analytic expression for $C_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE})$ under a specific set of assumptions for low-level injection.\n\nThe stated assumptions are:\n1.  The forward transit time, $\\tau_F$, is constant and independent of current and voltage.\n2.  The collector current is given by $I_C(V_{BE}) = I_S \\exp(V_{BE}/V_T)$, where $I_S$ is the saturation current and $V_T = k_B T / q$. This is a standard and accurate approximation for a BJT in the forward active region, where $V_{BE} \\gg V_T$. This implies an ideality factor of $n=1$.\n3.  The charge-control relation is $Q_B(V_{BE}) = \\tau_F I_C(V_{BE})$.\n\nWe begin by substituting the expression for $I_C(V_{BE})$ into the charge-control relation to find the specific form of $Q_B(V_{BE})$ for this case:\n$$\nQ_B(V_{BE}) = \\tau_F \\left( I_S \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nNow, we apply the definition of diffusion capacitance by differentiating this expression for $Q_B(V_{BE})$ with respect to $V_{BE}$:\n$$\nC_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE}) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}V_{BE}} \\left[ \\tau_F I_S \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\tau_F$ and $I_S$ are constants, we can take them out of the derivative:\n$$\nC_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE}) = \\tau_F I_S \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}V_{BE}} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nPerforming the differentiation yields:\n$$\nC_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE}) = \\tau_F I_S \\left( \\frac{1}{V_T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$\nC_{be,\\mathrm{diff}}(V_{BE}) = \\frac{\\tau_F I_S}{V_T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final, explicit analytic expression for the base-emitter diffusion capacitance under the specified low-level injection conditions. We can note for completeness that this result is equivalent to the well-known relation $C_{be,\\mathrm{diff}} = g_m \\tau_F$, since the transconductance $g_m = \\mathrm{d}I_C/\\mathrm{d}V_{BE} = I_C/V_T$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of two quantities related to the Kirk effect in an $n$-$p$-$n$ Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT): the critical collector current $I_{Kirk}$ and the increase in base transit time $\\Delta\\tau$ at the onset of this effect.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the critical collector current, $I_{Kirk}$. The Kirk effect, or base pushout, occurs at high-level injection when the concentration of mobile charge carriers (electrons in an $n$-$p$-$n$ BJT) traversing the collector depletion region becomes comparable to the fixed ionic charge of the donor atoms in the $n$-type collector. This fundamentally alters the space-charge profile and the electric field in the region.\n\nThe analysis begins with Poisson's equation, which describes the relationship between the electric field $E$ and the net space charge density $\\rho$. In the collector space-charge region, the net charge density is the sum of the fixed positive charge from ionized donors, $q N_C$, and the mobile negative charge from the injected electrons, $-q n(x)$.\n$$\n\\frac{dE(x)}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_{Si}} = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_{Si}} (N_C - n(x))\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{Si}$ is the permittivity of silicon, $q$ is the elementary charge, $N_C$ is the collector doping concentration, and $n(x)$ is the electron concentration at position $x$ within the collector.\n\nThe collector current $I_C$ is predominantly electron drift current. Under high-field conditions typical for high-level injection, the electrons travel at their saturation velocity, $v_{sat}$. The collector current density $J_C$ is given by:\n$$\nJ_C = \\frac{I_C}{A} = q n(x) v(x)\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the device. Assuming $v(x) \\approx v_{sat}$, the electron concentration $n$ is approximately uniform across the depletion region:\n$$\nn \\approx \\frac{J_C}{q v_{sat}} = \\frac{I_C}{A q v_{sat}}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $n$ back into Poisson's equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_{Si}} \\left( N_C - \\frac{I_C}{A q v_{sat}} \\right)\n$$\nThe term in the parenthesis represents the effective doping concentration in the collector space-charge region. Under low injection ($I_C \\to 0$), the slope of the electric field is positive and determined by $N_C$. As $I_C$ increases, the term in parenthesis decreases. The onset of the Kirk effect is defined as the point where this effective doping becomes zero, causing the electric field to flatten and subsequently invert its slope, effectively \"pushing\" the base into the collector. This critical condition occurs at the collector current $I_C = I_{Kirk}$ where:\n$$\nN_C - \\frac{I_{Kirk}}{A q v_{sat}} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $I_{Kirk}$, we obtain the expression for the critical collector current:\n$$\nI_{Kirk} = A q N_C v_{sat}\n$$\nWe can now calculate the numerical value of $I_{Kirk}$ using the provided data: $N_{C} = 1.0 \\times 10^{22}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}$, $A = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\text{m}^{2}$, $v_{sat} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, and the elementary charge $q \\approx 1.6021766 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}$.\n$$\nI_{Kirk} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\text{m}^{2}) \\times (1.6021766 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{22}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\nI_{Kirk} = 1.6021766 \\times 10^{(-10-19+22+5)}\\ \\text{A} = 1.6021766 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\text{A}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get $I_{Kirk} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\text{A}$.\n\nNext, we estimate the increase in the base transit time, $\\Delta\\tau$. The problem specifies a particular model for this calculation: \"treating the receded collector depletion region as a drift-limited segment traversed at $v_{sat}$ and adding its traversal time to the low-injection base diffusion transit time.\" The \"receded collector depletion region\" is the original base-collector space-charge region, which becomes charge-neutral at the onset of the Kirk effect and thus forms an extension of the quasi-neutral base. The width of this region is given as the zero-bias collector depletion width, $W_{C0}$. The problem asks for the *increase* in transit time, which, according to the specified model, is the time required for electrons to traverse this new segment of the effective base.\nThe traversal time is the width of the segment divided by the electron velocity. The problem states to use the saturation velocity, $v_{sat}$. Therefore, the increase in transit time, $\\Delta\\tau$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\tau = \\frac{W_{C0}}{v_{sat}}\n$$\nUsing the given values $W_{C0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{m}$ and $v_{sat} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\tau = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{m}}{1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $\\Delta\\tau = 5.000 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{s}$.
