            "problem": "In the context of Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) and subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling for incompressible turbulent flows, spatial filtering is used to separate resolved and unresolved scales. Consider a one-dimensional, linear, shift-invariant filter with a kernel $G_{\\Delta}(x)$ that is normalized so that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G_{\\Delta}(x)\\,dx = 1$. The filtered field is given by the convolution $\\bar{u}(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G_{\\Delta}(r)\\,u(x-r)\\,dr$. The spectral transfer function $\\widehat{G}_{\\Delta}(k)$ is defined as the Fourier transform of $G_{\\Delta}(x)$ under the convention $\\widehat{f}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)\\,\\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k x)\\,dx$, and the attenuation at wavenumber $k$ is $A(k) = |\\widehat{G}_{\\Delta}(k)|$.\n\nThree prototypical filters are considered, all associated with a characteristic filter width $\\Delta$:\n- A top-hat (box) filter with kernel $G_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(x)$ that is constant on an interval of width $\\Delta$ and zero elsewhere.\n- A Gaussian filter $G_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{G}}(x)$ whose standard deviation $\\sigma$ is chosen so that its second moment matches that of the top-hat filter.\n- A sharp spectral cutoff filter $G_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{CO}}(x)$ defined in Fourier space by a constant spectral transfer function over a finite band and zero outside, with cutoff chosen so that $k_{c}\\Delta = \\pi$.\n\nLet the nondimensional wavenumber be $\\xi = k \\Delta$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) for fluid dynamics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. All definitions and required conditions are standard within the field. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the spectral transfer function for a one-dimensional top-hat filter, and a subsequent comparison with the attenuation functions of equivalent Gaussian and sharp spectral cutoff filters.\n\nFirst, we define the kernel of the top-hat (or box) filter, $G_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(x)$. It is defined as a function that is constant over an interval of width $\\Delta$ and zero elsewhere. For symmetry, we center this interval at $x=0$. The normalization condition $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(x)\\,dx = 1$ dictates the constant value. Let the constant be $C$. Then,\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(x)\\,dx = \\int_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} C\\,dx = C \\cdot \\Delta = 1\n$$\nThis gives $C = 1/\\Delta$. The filter kernel is thus:\n$$\nG_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{\\Delta}  \\text{if } |x| \\le \\frac{\\Delta}{2} \\\\\n0  \\text{if } |x|  \\frac{\\Delta}{2}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe spectral transfer function, $\\widehat{G}_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(k)$, is the Fourier transform of the kernel $G_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(x)$. Using the provided definition of the Fourier transform, $\\widehat{f}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)\\,\\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k x)\\,dx$, we compute:\n$$\n\\widehat{G}_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(x)\\,\\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k x)\\,dx = \\int_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k x)\\,dx\n$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\n\\widehat{G}_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(k) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k x)}{-\\mathrm{i} k} \\right]_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} = \\frac{1}{-\\mathrm{i} k \\Delta} \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\mathrm{i} k \\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\mathrm{i} k \\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the Euler identity $\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\theta) - \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\theta)}{2\\mathrm{i}}$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$\n\\widehat{G}_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(k) = \\frac{1}{k \\Delta} \\left( \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\mathrm{i} k \\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\mathrm{i} k \\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right)}{\\mathrm{i}} \\right) = \\frac{2 \\sin\\left(k \\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right)}{k \\Delta} = \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\Delta}{2}\\right)}{\\frac{k\\Delta}{2}}\n$$\nThis is the sinc function, $\\mathrm{sinc}(z) = \\frac{\\sin(z)}{z}$. The problem requires the result to be expressed in terms of the nondimensional wavenumber $\\xi = k \\Delta$. Substituting $k\\Delta = \\xi$ into our result yields the final expression for the top-hat transfer function:\n$$\n\\widehat{G}_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(\\xi) = \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\xi}{2}\\right)}{\\frac{\\xi}{2}}\n$$\nThis function is real, so its attenuation is $A_{\\mathrm{TH}}(\\xi) = |\\widehat{G}_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(\\xi)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\xi/2)}{\\xi/2}\\right|$.\n\nNext, we derive the attenuation function for the Gaussian filter, $A_{\\mathrm{G}}(\\xi)$. The Gaussian filter kernel is $G_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{G}}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\exp(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2})$. Its standard deviation $\\sigma$ is specified by matching its second moment, $M_2^{\\mathrm{G}} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 G_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{G}}(x)\\,dx = \\sigma^2$, to that of the top-hat filter. The second moment of the top-hat filter is:\n$$\nM_2^{\\mathrm{TH}} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 G_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{TH}}(x)\\,dx = \\int_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} x^2 \\frac{1}{\\Delta}\\,dx = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} = \\frac{1}{3\\Delta} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta^3}{8} - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta^3}{8}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{2\\Delta^3}{24\\Delta} = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12}\n$$\nEquating the second moments gives $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12}$. The Fourier transform of a Gaussian function is another Gaussian function:\n$$\n\\widehat{G}_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{G}}(k) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2 \\sigma^2}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12}$:\n$$\n\\widehat{G}_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{G}}(k) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k^2 \\Delta^2}{24}\\right)\n$$\nIn terms of $\\xi = k\\Delta$, the attenuation function $A_{\\mathrm{G}}(\\xi) = |\\widehat{G}_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{G}}(\\xi)|$ becomes:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{G}}(\\xi) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\xi^2}{24}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we consider the sharp spectral cutoff filter. It is defined in Fourier space by a constant spectral transfer function for wavenumbers up to a cutoff $k_c$, and zero beyond. The normalization condition $\\int G(x)dx=1$ implies $\\widehat{G}(0)=1$, so the constant value is $1$. The cutoff is set by $k_c \\Delta = \\pi$, or $k_c = \\pi/\\Delta$. Thus, the transfer function is:\n$$\n\\widehat{G}_{\\Delta}^{\\mathrm{CO}}(k) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if } |k| \\le k_c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta} \\\\\n0  \\text{if } |k|  k_c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe condition $|k| \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta}$ is equivalent to $|k\\Delta| \\le \\pi$, or $|\\xi| \\le \\pi$. The attenuation function is therefore a rectangular function in wavenumber space:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{CO}}(\\xi) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if } |\\xi| \\le \\pi \\\\\n0  \\text{if } |\\xi|  \\pi\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nNow, we compare the attenuation behaviors. For small wavenumbers ($\\xi \\to 0$), we can use Taylor series expansions:\n$A_{\\mathrm{TH}}(\\xi) = \\frac{\\sin(\\xi/2)}{\\xi/2} \\approx \\frac{\\xi/2 - (\\xi/2)^3/6}{\\xi/2} = 1 - \\frac{\\xi^2}{24} + \\mathcal{O}(\\xi^4)$.\n$A_{\\mathrm{G}}(\\xi) = \\exp(-\\xi^2/24) \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\xi^2}{24} + \\mathcal{O}(\\xi^4)$.\n$A_{\\mathrm{CO}}(\\xi) = 1$ for $\\xi \\le \\pi$.\nThe equivalence of the leading-order attenuation for the top-hat and Gaussian filters for large scales (small $\\xi$) is a direct consequence of matching their second moments.\n\nAt the specific nondimensional wavenumber $\\xi = \\pi/2$:\n$A_{\\mathrm{TH}}(\\pi/2) = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi/4)}{\\pi/4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}/2}{\\pi/4} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} \\approx 0.9003$.\n$A_{\\mathrm{G}}(\\pi/2) = \\exp(-(\\pi/2)^2/24) = \\exp(-\\pi^2/96) \\approx 0.9023$.\n$A_{\\mathrm{CO}}(\\pi/2) = 1$.\nThe attenuation of the top-hat and Gaussian filters are very similar at this point, while the sharp cutoff filter has not attenuated the signal at all.\n\nQualitatively, the sharp cutoff filter is the most \"ideal\" low-pass filter, as it completely removes all modes with $\\xi  \\pi$ and perfectly preserves all modes with $\\xi  \\pi$. However, its kernel in physical space is the non-local sinc function, which is problematic for practical LES. The Gaussian filter has the desirable property of being localized in both physical and spectral space, providing a smooth, monotonic attenuation of high wavenumbers. The top-hat filter is localized in physical space but its transfer function has oscillations (side lobes), which can re-introduce energy at higher wavenumbers after passing through zero, a phenomenon known as spectral leakage. This is evident as $A_{\\mathrm{TH}}(\\xi)$ first reaches zero at $\\xi/2 = \\pi$, i.e., $\\xi=2\\pi$.",

Our derivations show that for both the top-hat and Gaussian kernels, the resolved gradient at the wall is less than $S$: $\\frac{S}{2}  S$ and $S(1 - 2/\\pi) \\approx 0.363S  S$.\n\nThis reduction is a direct mathematical consequence of applying a spatial filter near a boundary where the domain of the function is truncated. At a point $y$ near the wall, the filter kernel $G(\\eta-y)$ has part of its support in the non-physical region $\\eta  0$. The filter definition correctly restricts the integration to the physical domain $\\eta \\ge 0$ and renormalizes the filter weight.\n\nLet's consider the filtered velocity at the wall itself, $\\bar{u}(0)$. The unfiltered velocity is $u(0)=0$. However, the filtering process averages values of $u(\\eta)=S\\eta$ for $\\eta  0$. Since all these values are positive, the resulting average $\\bar{u}(0)$ is also positive. This creates an artificial \"slip velocity\" for the resolved field at the no-slip wall. For example, for the top-hat kernel, $\\bar{u}_T(0) = S\\Delta/4  0$.\n\nBecause the filtered profile $\\bar{u}(y)$ starts at a positive value at $y=0$ and must eventually match the unfiltered profile $u(y)$ for $y$ large compared to the filter width, its initial slope must be smaller than $S$. The filtering operation \"pulls\" the velocity values near the wall upward, flattening the profile. This discrepancy between the filtered gradient and the true gradient is often referred to as a \"commutation error,\" as the operations of differentiation and filtering do not commute near a boundary: $\\frac{d\\bar{u}}{dy} \\neq \\overline{(\\frac{du}{dy})}$.\n\nThis has a critical implication for subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling. The total shear stress at the wall is $\\tau_w = \\mu \\left.\\frac{du}{dy}\\right|_{y=0} = \\mu S$. In an LES framework, this stress must be represented as the sum of the resolved viscous stress and the SGS stress:\n$$\n\\tau_w = \\mu \\left.\\frac{d\\bar{u}}{dy}\\right|_{y=0^{+}} + \\tau_{sgs}|_{y=0}\n$$\nSince our analysis shows that $\\mu \\left.\\frac{d\\bar{u}}{dy}\\right|_{y=0^{+}}  \\mu S$, it is necessary that $\\tau_{sgs}|_{y=0}  0$. The SGS model must provide the \"missing\" part of the shear stress that is lost from the resolved field by the filtering operation itself. For the Gaussian kernel, the required SGS stress at the wall is $\\tau_{sgs}|_{y=0} = \\mu S - \\mu S(1-2/\\pi) = \\mu S (2/\\pi)$. This demonstrates that any SGS model intended for use down to the wall must be constructed to account for this filtering artifact, which is the fundamental challenge addressed by wall-modeling in LES.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe resolved wall-normal gradients at $y=0^{+}$ for the top-hat and Gaussian kernels are $\\frac{S}{2}$ and $S(1 - \\frac{2}{\\pi})$, respectively.

The Smagorinsky model: an eddy-viscosity model with eddy viscosity $\\nu_t = (C_s \\Delta)^2 \\, \\lvert S \\rvert$, where $C_s$ is the Smagorinsky constant, $\\Delta$ is the filter width, and\n$$\nS_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}_j}{\\partial x_i}\\right),\n\\quad\n\\lvert S \\rvert = \\sqrt{2 S_{ij} S_{ij}}.\n$$\nThe modeled stress is\n$$\n\\tau^{\\text{Smag}}_{ij} = -2 \\nu_t S_{ij}.\n$$\nFor consistency with comparison against the exact deviatoric stress, use the deviatoric part $\\tau'^{\\text{Smag}}_{ij}$, defined analogously to $\\tau'_{ij}$.\n\n2. The Gradient (Clark) model: for a top-hat filter of width $\\Delta$, the leading-order approximation to the stress is\n$$\n\\tau^{\\text{Grad}}_{ij} = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12}\\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}_i}{\\partial x_k}\\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}_j}{\\partial x_k},\n$$\nand its deviatoric part is\n$$\n\\tau'^{\\text{Grad}}_{ij} = \\tau^{\\text{Grad}}_{ij} - \\frac{1}{d}\\tau^{\\text{Grad}}_{kk}\\delta_{ij}.\n$$\n\nDesign an a priori test that, for each specified filter width $\\Delta$, computes the exact deviatoric stress $\\tau'_{ij}$ from filtered Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data (here, the synthetic field defined above serves as the DNS field), and then computes the mismatch of each model relative to the exact deviatoric stress using the following dimensionless metric:\n$$\nE^{\\text{model}}(\\Delta) = \\frac{\\left\\|\\tau'^{\\text{model}}_{ij} - \\tau'_{ij}\\right\\|_2}{\\left\\|\\tau'_{ij}\\right\\|_2},\n$$\nwhere the discrete $L^2$ norm $\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert_2$ aggregates all tensor components and grid points.\n\nUse central finite differences with periodic boundary conditions to compute spatial derivatives on the filtered field. Implement the box filter as a periodic average over $L \\times L$ points. Set the Smagorinsky constant to $C_s = 0.17$. All computations and outputs are dimensionless. Angles are not involved.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Use $L \\in \\{3,7,15,31\\}$, corresponding to filter widths $\\Delta = L h$.\n- For each $L$, compute and report $E^{\\text{Smag}}(\\Delta)$ and $E^{\\text{Grad}}(\\Delta)$ as floating-point numbers.\n\nFinal Output Format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered as\n$$\n\\left[E^{\\text{Smag}}(L{=}3h), E^{\\text{Grad}}(L{=}3h), E^{\\text{Smag}}(L{=}7h), E^{\\text{Grad}}(L{=}7h), E^{\\text{Smag}}(L{=}15h), E^{\\text{Grad}}(L{=}15h), E^{\\text{Smag}}(L{=}31h), E^{\\text{Grad}}(L{=}31h)\\right].\n$$\nNo units are required; each entry must be a floating-point number.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an a priori analysis of two large-eddy simulation (LES) subgrid-scale (SGS) models: the Smagorinsky model and the Gradient (Clark) model. This analysis will be performed on a synthetically generated two-dimensional, incompressible velocity field. The core task is to compute the exact deviatoric SGS stress tensor from this high-resolution field and compare it against the stress tensors predicted by the models, which are computed from a filtered version of the velocity field. The comparison is quantified using a normalized discrete $L^2$ error norm for a series of specified filter widths.\n\nThe solution proceeds through the following structured steps:\n\n1.  **Grid and Velocity Field Generation**: The domain is the unit square $[0,1]^2$ discretized into a uniform grid of $N \\times N$ points, where $N=128$. The grid spacing is $h = 1/N = 1/128$. The grid coordinates $(x,y)$ are defined as $x_i = i h$ and $y_j = j h$ for $i,j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$. The velocity field $\\mathbf{u} = (u, v)$ is derived analytically from the given streamfunction $\\psi(x,y)$:\n    $$\n    \\psi(x,y) = A_1 \\sin(2\\pi x)\\sin(2\\pi y) + A_2 \\sin(4\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi y) + A_3 \\cos(3\\pi x)\\sin(5\\pi y)\n    $$\n    with constants $A_1 = 1$, $A_2 = 1/2$, and $A_3 = 1/3$. The velocity components are $u = \\partial\\psi/\\partial y$ and $v = -\\partial\\psi/\\partial x$. Their analytical expressions are:\n    $$\n    u(x,y) = 2\\pi A_1 \\sin(2\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi y) - 2\\pi A_2 \\sin(4\\pi x)\\sin(2\\pi y) + 5\\pi A_3 \\cos(3\\pi x)\\cos(5\\pi y)\n    $$\n    $$\n    v(x,y) = -\\left( 2\\pi A_1 \\cos(2\\pi x)\\sin(2\\pi y) + 4\\pi A_2 \\cos(4\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi y) - 3\\pi A_3 \\sin(3\\pi x)\\sin(5\\pi y) \\right)\n    $$\n    These functions are evaluated on the $N \\times N$ grid to produce the high-resolution \"DNS\" velocity field.\n\n2.  **Numerical Operations**: Two primary numerical operations are required: spatial filtering and differentiation.\n    -   **Filtering**: The top-hat (box) filter of width $\\Delta = L h$ is implemented as a uniform average over an $L \\times L$ grid-point window. This operation respects the periodic boundary conditions of the domain and is efficiently performed using a uniform filter function with wrap-around mode (e.g., `scipy.ndimage.uniform_filter` with `mode='wrap'`).\n    -   **Differentiation**: Spatial derivatives (e.g., $\\partial f/\\partial x$) are computed using a second-order central finite difference scheme on the periodic grid. For a function $f$ on the discrete grid, the derivative with respect to $x$ at grid point $(j, i)$ is approximated by:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{(j,i)} \\approx \\frac{f_{j, i+1} - f_{j, i-1}}{2h}\n    $$\n    Periodic indices are handled by wrapping around the grid (e.g., $f_{j,N} = f_{j,0}$).\n\n3.  **Calculation of the Exact Deviatoric SGS Stress ($\\tau'_{ij}$)**: For a given filter width $\\Delta$, the exact SGS stress is computed as follows:\n    -   The filtered velocity components, $\\bar{u}_i$, are obtained by applying the $L \\times L$ box filter to the DNS velocity components $u_i$.\n    -   The filtered velocity products, $\\overline{u_i u_j}$, are obtained by first computing the products (e.g., $u^2$, $uv$, $v^2$) on the DNS grid and then applying the same box filter.\n    -   The SGS stress tensor components are calculated using their definition: $\\tau_{ij} = \\overline{u_i u_j} - \\bar{u}_i \\bar{u}_j$. The required components are $\\tau_{11}$, $\\tau_{12}$, and $\\tau_{22}$.\n    -   The deviatoric (trace-free) part of this tensor, $\\tau'_{ij}$, is then found:\n    $$\n    \\tau'_{ij} = \\tau_{ij} - \\frac{1}{d}\\tau_{kk}\\delta_{ij} = \\tau_{ij} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\tau_{11} + \\tau_{22})\\delta_{ij}\n    $$\n    This yields the target tensor field for the a priori test.\n\n4.  **Calculation of the Smagorinsky Model Stress ($\\tau'^{\\text{Smag}}_{ij}$)**:\n    -   The filtered rate-of-strain tensor, $S_{ij}$, is computed from the filtered velocity field $\\bar{\\mathbf{u}}$:\n    $$\n    S_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}_j}{\\partial x_i}\\right)\n    $$\n    using the periodic central difference scheme.\n    -   The magnitude of the strain rate is calculated as $|\\boldsymbol{S}| = \\sqrt{2 S_{ij} S_{ij}}$.\n    -   The eddy viscosity, $\\nu_t$, is computed at each grid point: $\\nu_t = (C_s \\Delta)^2 \\, |\\boldsymbol{S}|$, with the Smagorinsky constant $C_s=0.17$.\n    -   The modeled stress tensor is given by $\\tau^{\\text{Smag}}_{ij} = -2\\nu_t S_{ij}$.\n    -   Finally, the deviatoric part of the modeled stress, $\\tau'^{\\text{Smag}}_{ij}$, is computed identically to how $\\tau'_{ij}$ was computed.\n\n5.  **Calculation of the Gradient Model Stress ($\\tau'^{\\text{Grad}}_{ij}$)**:\n    -   The model is defined as $\\tau^{\\text{Grad}}_{ij} = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12}\\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}_i}{\\partial x_k}\\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}_j}{\\partial x_k}$. The necessary derivatives of the filtered velocity components are computed using central differences.\n    -   The components $\\tau^{\\text{Grad}}_{11}$, $\\tau^{\\text{Grad}}_{12}$, and $\\tau^{\\text{Grad}}_{22}$ are computed from these derivatives.\n    -   The deviatoric part, $\\tau'^{\\text{Grad}}_{ij}$, is obtained by subtracting the isotropic component: $\\tau'^{\\text{Grad}}_{ij} = \\tau^{\\text{Grad}}_{ij} - \\frac{1}{d}\\tau^{\\text{Grad}}_{kk}\\delta_{ij}$.\n\n6.  **Error Metric Calculation**: The performance of each model is quantified by the normalized error metric $E^{\\text{model}}(\\Delta)$:\n    $$\n    E^{\\text{model}}(\\Delta) = \\frac{\\left\\|\\tau'^{\\text{model}}_{ij} - \\tau'_{ij}\\right\\|_2}{\\left\\|\\tau'_{ij}\\right\\|_2}\n    $$\n    The term $\\|\\cdot\\|_2$ denotes the discrete $L^2$ norm (or Frobenius norm) of the tensor field, which is the square root of the sum of squares of all tensor components at all grid points. Let $T_{ij}$ be a tensor field on the grid. Its norm is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\|T_{ij}\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{p=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{q=0}^{N-1} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{d} (T_{ij})_{p,q}^2}\n    $$\n    The error metric is computed for both the Smagorinsky and Gradient models for each filter size $L \\in \\{3, 7, 15, 31\\}$. The results are collected and formatted as specified.\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import uniform_filter\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs an a priori test of the Smagorinsky and Gradient subgrid-scale models.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Problem Parameters ---\n    N = 128\n    h = 1.0 / N\n    d = 2.0\n    A1, A2, A3 = 1.0, 0.5, 1.0 / 3.0\n    Cs = 0.17\n    L_values = [3, 7, 15, 31]\n    \n    # --- Grid Setup ---\n    # Create a grid [0, 1-h] x [0, 1-h]\n    x = np.linspace(0, 1, N, endpoint=False)\n    y = np.linspace(0, 1, N, endpoint=False)\n    xx, yy = np.meshgrid(x, y, indexing='xy')\n\n    # --- DNS Velocity Field Generation (Analytical) ---\n    pi = np.pi\n    u_dns = (A1 * 2*pi * np.sin(2*pi*xx) * np.cos(2*pi*yy) -\n             A2 * 2*pi * np.sin(4*pi*xx) * np.sin(2*pi*yy) +\n             A3 * 5*pi * np.cos(3*pi*xx) * np.cos(5*pi*yy))\n    \n    v_dns = -(A1 * 2*pi * np.cos(2*pi*xx) * np.sin(2*pi*yy) +\n              A2 * 4*pi * np.cos(4*pi*xx) * np.cos(2*pi*yy) -\n              A3 * 3*pi * np.sin(3*pi*xx) * np.sin(5*pi*yy))\n\n    # --- Helper Functions ---\n    def calculate_derivatives(field, grid_spacing):\n        \"\"\"Computes derivatives using periodic second-order central differences.\"\"\"\n        # For a field F[y, x], axis 0 is y, axis 1 is x.\n        # However, numpy's meshgrid with indexing='xy' makes xx shape (N,N)\n        # where xx[j,i] corresponds to x_i and yy[j,i] to y_j.\n        # This means field[j,i] is at (x_i, y_j).\n        # np.roll with axis=1 corresponds to x-direction.\n        # np.roll with axis=0 corresponds to y-direction.\n        dF_dx = (np.roll(field, -1, axis=1) - np.roll(field, 1, axis=1)) / (2 * grid_spacing)\n        dF_dy = (np.roll(field, -1, axis=0) - np.roll(field, 1, axis=0)) / (2 * grid_spacing)\n        return dF_dx, dF_dy\n\n    def calculate_norm(tensor_components):\n        \"\"\"Computes the L2 norm over all grid points and tensor components.\"\"\"\n        # tensor_components is a list of 4 2D arrays: T11, T12, T21, T22\n        return np.linalg.norm(np.stack(tensor_components))\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # --- Main Loop over Test Cases ---\n    for L in L_values:\n        Delta = L * h\n        \n        # --- 1.
