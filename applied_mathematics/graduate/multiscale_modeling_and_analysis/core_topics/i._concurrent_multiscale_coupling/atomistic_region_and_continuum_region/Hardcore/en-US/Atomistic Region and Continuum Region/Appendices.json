            "problem": "Consider an infinite one-dimensional monatomic chain representing the atomistic region of a multiscale model. The atoms of mass $m$ are equally spaced by a lattice parameter $a$ and interact through identical linear nearest-neighbor springs with stiffness $K$. The continuum region approximates the long-wavelength behavior of this chain as a homogeneous one-dimensional elastic medium. Starting from Newton's second law for each atom and Hooke's law for the springs, derive the dispersion relation $\\omega(k)$ for plane-wave solutions in the atomistic chain, where $k$ is the wave number. Then, by coarse-graining to a continuum description, determine the continuum wave speed $c$ in the long-wavelength limit, defined as the limit $ka \\to 0$ where $\\omega(k)$ behaves linearly in $|k|$. Use the definition $c = \\lim_{k \\to 0} \\frac{\\omega(k)}{|k|}$, and express $c$ solely in terms of $m$, $K$, and $a$. Provide the final answer as two analytic expressions in a single row matrix: the exact atomistic dispersion relation $\\omega(k)$ and the continuum-limit wave speed $c$. No numerical evaluation is required. If you were to evaluate $c$ numerically, it would be expressed in meters per second, but for this problem, report symbolic expressions only.",
            "solution": "First, we establish the equation of motion for an arbitrary atom in the one-dimensional chain. Let $u_n(t)$ be the displacement of the $n$-th atom from its equilibrium position, $x_n = na$, where $n$ is an integer, and $a$ is the lattice parameter. The force on the $n$-th atom is exerted by its nearest neighbors, atoms $n-1$ and $n+1$, through linear springs of stiffness $K$.\n\nThe force exerted by atom $n+1$ on atom $n$ is given by Hooke's law: $F_{n \\leftarrow n+1} = K((x_{n+1} + u_{n+1}) - (x_n + u_n) - a)$. Since $x_{n+1} - x_n = a$, this simplifies to $F_{n \\leftarrow n+1} = K(u_{n+1} - u_n)$.\nSimilarly, the force exerted by atom $n-1$ on atom $n$ is $F_{n \\leftarrow n-1} = K((x_{n-1} + u_{n-1}) - (x_n + u_n) + a)$. Since $x_{n-1} - x_n = -a$, this simplifies to $F_{n \\leftarrow n-1} = K(u_{n-1} - u_n)$.\n\nThe net force on the $n$-th atom is the sum of these two forces:\n$$F_n = F_{n \\leftarrow n+1} + F_{n \\leftarrow n-1} = K(u_{n+1} - u_n) + K(u_{n-1} - u_n) = K(u_{n+1} + u_{n-1} - 2u_n)$$\nAccording to Newton's second law, $F_n = m \\ddot{u}_n$, where $m$ is the mass of the atom and $\\ddot{u}_n$ is its acceleration. This gives the equation of motion:\n$$m \\frac{d^2 u_n}{dt^2} = K(u_{n+1} - 2u_n + u_{n-1})$$\nTo find the dispersion relation, we seek plane-wave solutions of the form:\n$$u_n(t) = A \\exp(i(kx_n - \\omega t)) = A \\exp(i(kna - \\omega t))$$\nwhere $k$ is the wave number and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. We substitute this ansatz into the equation of motion. The time derivative is:\n$$\\frac{d^2 u_n}{dt^2} = (-i\\omega)^2 u_n = -\\omega^2 u_n$$\nThe displacements of the neighboring atoms are:\n$$u_{n+1}(t) = A \\exp(i(k(n+1)a - \\omega t)) = u_n(t) \\exp(ika)$$\n$$u_{n-1}(t) = A \\exp(i(k(n-1)a - \\omega t)) = u_n(t) \\exp(-ika)$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation of motion yields:\n$$m(-\\omega^2 u_n) = K(u_n \\exp(ika) - 2u_n + u_n \\exp(-ika))$$\nDividing by the common factor $u_n$ (which is non-zero for a non-trivial solution), we get:\n$$-m\\omega^2 = K(\\exp(ika) + \\exp(-ika) - 2)$$\nUsing Euler's identity, $\\exp(i\\theta) + \\exp(-i\\theta) = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, we have:\n$$-m\\omega^2 = K(2\\cos(ka) - 2) = -2K(1 - \\cos(ka))$$\nApplying the trigonometric half-angle identity, $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$, gives:\n$$-m\\omega^2 = -2K\\left(2\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right)\\right) = -4K\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right)$$\nSolving for $\\omega^2$:\n$$\\omega^2 = \\frac{4K}{m}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right)$$\nSince the angular frequency $\\omega$ must be a non-negative quantity, we take the positive square root:\n$$\\omega(k) = \\sqrt{\\frac{4K}{m}}\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right)\\right| = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}}\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right)\\right|$$\nThis is the exact dispersion relation for the one-dimensional monatomic chain.\n\nNext, we determine the continuum wave speed $c$ in the long-wavelength limit, which corresponds to $k \\to 0$ or, more precisely, the dimensionless quantity $ka \\to 0$. In this limit, the dispersion relation is expected to become linear, i.e., $\\omega(k) \\approx c|k|$. The problem defines the wave speed as $c = \\lim_{k \\to 0} \\frac{\\omega(k)}{|k|}$.\n\nFor small values of the argument $x$, the sine function can be approximated by its Taylor series expansion: $\\sin(x) = x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + O(x^5)$. In our case, the argument is $x = \\frac{ka}{2}$. As $ka \\to 0$, this argument also goes to zero.\nSo, for small $ka$:\n$$\\sin\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{ka}{2}$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the dispersion relation:\n$$\\omega(k) \\approx 2\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}}\\left|\\frac{ka}{2}\\right| = a\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}}|k|$$\nThis shows the linear dependence of $\\omega$ on $|k|$ in the long-wavelength limit.\nNow we can compute the limit to find the wave speed $c$:\n$$c = \\lim_{k \\to 0} \\frac{\\omega(k)}{|k|} = \\lim_{k \\to 0} \\frac{2\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}}\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right)\\right|}{|k|}$$\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric limit $\\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} = 1$:\n$$c = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}} \\lim_{k \\to 0} \\frac{\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right)\\right|}{|k|} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}} \\lim_{k \\to 0} \\left|\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right)}{\\frac{ka}{2}}\\cdot\\frac{ka/2}{k}\\right|$$\n$$c = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}} \\left| \\left( \\lim_{k \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(ka/2)}{ka/2} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{a}{2} \\right| = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}} \\left|1 \\cdot \\frac{a}{2}\\right|$$\nSince $a$ is the lattice parameter and is positive:\n$$c = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}} \\frac{a}{2} = a\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}}$$\nThis is the wave speed in the continuum limit.

Assuming the mapping operator $\\mathcal{I}$ is linear, so that $\\mathcal{I}(\\delta u_a) = \\sum_j \\phi_j(x) \\delta u_j$ for some shape functions $\\phi_j(x)$, we have:\n$$\n\\delta \\mathcal{E}_{\\text{coup}} = \\int_0^{L_o} \\lambda \\left(u_c(x)-\\mathcal{I}u_a(x)\\right)\\left(\\delta u_c(x) - \\mathcal{I}(\\delta u_a)(x)\\right) dx\\\\\n= \\int_0^{L_o} \\lambda \\left(u_c(x)-\\mathcal{I}u_a(x)\\right) \\delta u_c(x) dx - \\sum_j \\left(\\int_0^{L_o} \\lambda \\left(u_c(x)-\\mathcal{I}u_a(x)\\right) \\phi_j(x) dx \\right)\\delta u_j.\n$$\nThe residuals from this term are $R_c^{(2)}(x) = -\\lambda(u_c(x)-\\mathcal{I}u_a(x))$ and $R_{a,j}^{(2)} = \\int_0^{L_o} \\lambda (u_c(x)-\\mathcal{I}u_a(x))\\phi_j(x)dx$.\n\nThe total residuals are:\n$$R_c(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(w_c(x) E_c u_c'(x)\\right) - \\lambda\\big(u_c(x)-\\mathcal{I}u_a(x)\\big)$$\n$$R_{a,j} = -\\left(w_a(x_{j-\\frac{1}{2}})\\frac{k_a}{a}(u_j-u_{j-1}) - w_a(x_{j+\\frac{1}{2}})\\frac{k_a}{a}(u_{j+1}-u_j)\\right) + \\lambda\\int_0^{L_o}\\big(u_c(x)-\\mathcal{I}u_a(x)\\big)\\phi_j(x)dx$$\n\nNow we apply the patch test by prescribing the uniform strain state $u_i = \\epsilon x_i = \\epsilon i a$ and $u_c(x) = \\epsilon x$ for an arbitrary constant $\\epsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nFor this state, we have $u_{i+1}-u_i = \\epsilon a$ and $u_c'(x)=\\epsilon$.\n\nThe first necessary condition arises from the coupling term $\\lambda\\big(u_c(x)-\\mathcal{I}u_a(x)\\big)$. For the residuals to vanish for arbitrary fields, this \"ghost force\" term must be zero. If it were non-zero, it would require a coincidental cancellation from the other terms, which is not a general condition. Therefore, we must have $u_c(x)-\\mathcal{I}u_a(x) = 0$ for the prescribed affine field.\nThe diagnostic variable $\\delta$ measures the maximum of this mismatch for any affine field.\nSpecifically, $\\delta = \\sup_{x\\in[0,L_o]} \\Big|\\,\\big(\\mathcal{I}u_a^{\\mathrm{aff}}\\big)(x) - u_c^{\\mathrm{aff}}(x)\\,\\Big|$, where $u_a^{\\mathrm{aff}}(x)=\\epsilon x + c$ and $u_c^{\\mathrm{aff}}(x)=\\epsilon x + c$.\nFor the patch test to pass, this mismatch must be identically zero for any $\\epsilon$ and $c$. Thus, the supremum of its magnitude must be zero.\nCondition 1: $\\delta = 0$. This implies that the mapping operator $\\mathcal{I}$ must reproduce affine functions exactly.\n\nWith $\\delta=0$, the coupling terms in the residuals vanish. The residuals simplify to:\n$$R_c(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(w_c(x) E_c \\epsilon\\right) = \\epsilon E_c w_c'(x)$$\n$$R_{a,j} = -\\left(w_a(x_{j-\\frac{1}{2}})\\frac{k_a}{a}(\\epsilon a) - w_a(x_{j+\\frac{1}{2}})\\frac{k_a}{a}(\\epsilon a)\\right) = -\\epsilon k_a \\left(w_a(x_{j-\\frac{1}{2}}) - w_a(x_{j+\\frac{1}{2}})\\right)$$\nFor these residuals to be zero for any $\\epsilon \\neq 0$, we must have:\n1. $E_c w_c'(x) = 0$. Since $E_c  0$, this requires $w_c'(x)=0$, meaning $w_c(x)$ is a constant.\n2. $k_a(w_a(x_{j-\\frac{1}{2}}) - w_a(x_{j+\\frac{1}{2}})) = 0$. Since $k_a  0$, this requires $w_a(x_{j-\\frac{1}{2}}) = w_a(x_{j+\\frac{1}{2}})$ for all bonds in the overlap region. If $w_a(x)$ is a continuous (or sufficiently simple) function, this implies $w_a(x)$ must also be constant.\n\nThe second set of necessary conditions comes from energy consistency. The energy density of the blended model must match the energy density of the pure component models.\nThe continuum strain energy density is $W_c = \\frac{1}{2} E_c (u_c')^2$.\nFor the atomistic chain, the energy term for a bond is $\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{k_a}{a}(u_{i+1}-u_i)^2$. The energy density (energy per unit length) is this energy divided by the bond length $a$:\n$$W_a = \\frac{1}{a} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{k_a}{a}(u_{i+1}-u_i)^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} k_a \\left(\\frac{u_{i+1}-u_i}{a}\\right)^2.$$\nFor a uniform strain $\\epsilon$, $u_c' = \\epsilon$ and $(u_{i+1}-u_i)/a = \\epsilon$. The energy densities become $W_c = \\frac{1}{2}E_c\\epsilon^2$ and $W_a = \\frac{1}{2}k_a\\epsilon^2$.\nFor the models to be consistent, their energy densities must be equal, so $W_c = W_a$. This implies $\\frac{1}{2}E_c\\epsilon^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k_a\\epsilon^2$, leading to $E_c = k_a$.\nThe diagnostic variable is $\\eta \\equiv E_c/k_a$.\nCondition 2: $\\eta = 1$.\n\nFinally, the energy density of the blended region must equal the pure-model energy density. The energy in an infinitesimal length $dx$ of the blended region is (by coarse-graining the sum):\n$$d\\mathcal{E}_{blend} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} w_a(x) k_a \\epsilon^2 + \\frac{1}{2} w_c(x) E_c \\epsilon^2 \\right) dx.$$\nThe blended energy density is $W_{blend} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(w_a(x) k_a + w_c(x) E_c\\right) \\epsilon^2$.\nThis must equal $W_a = W_c = \\frac{1}{2}k_a\\epsilon^2$.\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left(w_a(x) k_a + w_c(x) E_c\\right) \\epsilon^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k_a \\epsilon^2$$\n$$w_a(x) k_a + w_c(x) E_c = k_a$$\nUsing Condition 2 ($E_c=k_a$), this becomes:\n$$w_a(x) k_a + w_c(x) k_a = k_a$$\nSince $k_a  0$, we can divide by it to obtain $w_a(x) + w_c(x) = 1$ for all $x\\in[0,L_o]$. This is the standard partition-of-unity condition for blending functions.\nThe diagnostic variable is $\\sigma \\equiv \\sup_{x\\in[0,L_o]} |w_a(x)+w_c(x)-1|$.\nIf $w_a(x)+w_c(x)=1$ for all $x$, then the argument of the supremum is always $0$.\nCondition 3: $\\sigma = 0$.\n\nNote that if $w_a(x)+w_c(x)=1$ and we already established $w_c(x)$ must be constant for the residual to vanish, then $w_a(x)$ must also be constant, which satisfies the condition derived from the atomistic residual.\n\nIn summary, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the patch test to pass are captured by the values of the three dimensionless diagnostics:\n1.  $\\delta=0$: Kinematic consistency (interpolation reproduces affine fields).\n2.  $\\eta=1$: Constitutive consistency ($E_c = k_a$).\n3.  $\\sigma=0$: Energetic consistency ($w_a(x) + w_c(x) = 1$).\n\nTherefore, the triplet of values $(\\eta, \\sigma, \\delta)$ must be $(1, 0, 0)$.",
