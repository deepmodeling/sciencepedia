            "problem": "Consider a linear four-atom fragment with atoms labeled $1$–$2$–$3$–$4$, where atoms $2$ and $3$ form the quantum mechanical region $Q=\\{2,3\\}$ and atoms $1$ and $4$ form the molecular mechanics region $M=\\{1,4\\}$. The classical molecular mechanics description employs a standard, well-tested energy decomposition into bonded, angle, and dihedral contributions with the following functional forms:\n- Bonded terms for directly bonded pairs $(i,j)$: $E_{\\mathrm{bond}}(i,j)=\\frac{1}{2}k_{ij}\\left(r_{ij}-r_{ij}^{0}\\right)^{2}$.\n- Angle terms for triplets $(i,j,k)$: $E_{\\mathrm{angle}}(i,j,k)=\\frac{1}{2}k_{ijk}\\left(\\alpha_{ijk}-\\alpha_{ijk}^{0}\\right)^{2}$.\n- Dihedral terms for quadruplets $(i,j,k,\\ell)$: $E_{\\mathrm{dihedral}}(i,j,k,\\ell)=\\sum_{m=1}^{p}\\frac{V_{m}}{2}\\left[1+\\cos\\!\\left(m\\,\\phi_{ijkl}-\\gamma_{m}\\right)\\right]$, where the sum over $m$ represents a standard Fourier-series torsional parameterization with amplitudes $V_{m}$, periodicities $m$, and phase offsets $\\gamma_{m}$.\n\nAssume the molecule is topologized with bonds $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,4)$, angles $(1,2,3)$, $(2,3,4)$, and dihedral $(1,2,3,4)$. In a subtractive quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) scheme, the hybrid energy is constructed by replacing the molecular mechanics description of the quantum mechanical region by a quantum mechanical treatment, while retaining the molecular mechanics description for the full system and removing the purely molecular mechanics description of the quantum mechanical region. Start from this specification and from the decomposition of the classical energy into internal-to-$Q$, internal-to-$M$, and mixed $Q$–$M$ interaction classes. Using only these foundations, derive the net effect of subtracting the molecular mechanics energy of the quantum mechanical region, $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q)$, on the bonded, angle, and dihedral terms that straddle the QM/MM boundary.\n\nCompute and provide, as a single closed-form analytic expression, the residual contribution from the boundary-straddling bonded, angle, and dihedral terms that remain after subtracting $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q)$ in this four-atom system, in terms of $r_{12}$, $r_{34}$, $\\alpha_{123}$, $\\alpha_{234}$, $\\phi_{1234}$ and the corresponding parameters $k_{12}$, $r_{12}^{0}$, $k_{34}$, $r_{34}^{0}$, $k_{123}$, $\\alpha_{123}^{0}$, $k_{234}$, $\\alpha_{234}^{0}$, $\\{V_{m},\\gamma_{m}\\}_{m=1}^{p}$. Do not include units in the final expression. No numerical evaluation is required.\n\nThen, in your derivation, identify and explain the conditions under which cancellation is incomplete for boundary-straddling terms in subtractive QM/MM schemes, focusing on physically realistic features such as multi-atom cross-boundary couplings, capping/link-atom modifications, and non-additive or topology-dependent functional forms. Your final answer must be a single analytic expression.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of multiscale modeling, specifically subtractive QM/MM schemes. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a formal derivation.\n\nThe core of a subtractive QM/MM scheme is the expression for the total energy of the system, $E_{\\mathrm{QM/MM}}$. For a system partitioned into a quantum mechanical region $Q$ and a molecular mechanics region $M$, the energy is given by:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{QM/MM}} = E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M) - E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q) + E_{\\mathrm{QM}}(Q)$$\nHere, $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M)$ is the MM energy of the entire system, $E_{\\mathrm{QM}}(Q)$ is the QM energy of the isolated QM region, and $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q)$ is the MM energy of the isolated QM region. The subtraction of $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q)$ is intended to correct for the double-counting of interactions within the $Q$ region, which are described by both $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M)$ and $E_{\\mathrm{QM}}(Q)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the residual contribution from boundary-straddling terms that remain after subtracting $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q)$ from $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M)$. This corresponds to the classical mechanical portion of the total hybrid energy, $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M) - E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q)$.\n\nFirst, we identify all MM energy terms for the full four-atom system $1$–$2$–$3$–$4$, denoted as $Q+M$, based on the provided topology. The QM region is $Q=\\{2,3\\}$ and the MM region is $M=\\{1,4\\}$.\n\nThe total MM energy, $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M)$, is the sum of all defined bonded and non-bonded interactions. The problem specifies bonds $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,4)$; angles $(1,2,3)$, $(2,3,4)$; and dihedral $(1,2,3,4)$. The corresponding energy is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M) = E_{\\mathrm{bond}}(1,2) + E_{\\mathrm{bond}}(2,3) + E_{\\mathrm{bond}}(3,4) + E_{\\mathrm{angle}}(1,2,3) + E_{\\mathrm{angle}}(2,3,4) + E_{\\mathrm{dihedral}}(1,2,3,4)$$\nWe can classify these terms based on whether they are internal to the $Q$ region, internal to the $M$ region, or straddle the boundary (mixed $Q-M$ terms).\n- **Internal-to-Q terms:** These involve only atoms from $Q=\\{2,3\\}$. The only such term is the bond between atoms $2$ and $3$.\n  $$E_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{\\mathrm{int-Q}} = E_{\\mathrm{bond}}(2,3)$$\n- **Internal-to-M terms:** These involve only atoms from $M=\\{1,4\\}$. In this linear topology, there are no bonds, angles, or dihedrals involving only atoms $1$ and $4$.\n  $$E_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{\\mathrm{int-M}} = 0$$\n- **Mixed Q-M (boundary-straddling) terms:** These involve atoms from both $Q$ and $M$.\n  - Bonds: The $(1,2)$ bond connects $M$ to $Q$. The $(3,4)$ bond connects $Q$ to $M$.\n  - Angles: The $(1,2,3)$ angle involves atoms from $M$ and $Q$. The $(2,3,4)$ angle involves atoms from $Q$ and $M$.\n  - Dihedral: The $(1,2,3,4)$ dihedral involves atoms from both $M$ and $Q$.\n  Thus, the set of all boundary-straddling terms is:\n  $$E_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{\\mathrm{mixed}} = E_{\\mathrm{bond}}(1,2) + E_{\\mathrm{bond}}(3,4) + E_{\\mathrm{angle}}(1,2,3) + E_{\\mathrm{angle}}(2,3,4) + E_{\\mathrm{dihedral}}(1,2,3,4)$$\n\nNext, we define the subtraction term, $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q)$. This is the energy of the isolated QM region, $\\{2,3\\}$, calculated with the same MM force field. Based on the provided topology rules, the only interaction term that can be defined using only atoms $2$ and $3$ is the bond between them.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q) = E_{\\mathrm{bond}}(2,3)$$\nIt is evident that for this simple additive force field, $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q) = E_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{\\mathrm{int-Q}}$.\n\nNow we compute the classical part of the hybrid energy by performing the subtraction:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M) - E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q) = (E_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{\\mathrm{int-Q}} + E_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{\\mathrm{int-M}} + E_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{\\mathrm{mixed}}) - E_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{\\mathrm{int-Q}}$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M) - E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q) = E_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{\\mathrm{int-M}} + E_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{\\mathrm{mixed}}$$\nSince $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{\\mathrm{int-M}}$ is zero, the result is simply the sum of all mixed Q-M terms:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M) - E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q) = E_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{\\mathrm{mixed}}$$\nThe subtraction of $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q)$ perfectly removes the purely classical description of the QM region, leaving the boundary-straddling terms untouched. The problem asks for the \"residual contribution from the boundary-straddling ... terms\". This contribution is therefore the sum of these terms themselves.\n\nSubstituting the functional forms provided in the problem statement:\n- $E_{\\mathrm{bond}}(1,2) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{12}(r_{12}-r_{12}^{0})^{2}$\n- $E_{\\mathrm{bond}}(3,4) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{34}(r_{34}-r_{34}^{0})^{2}$\n- $E_{\\mathrm{angle}}(1,2,3) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{123}(\\alpha_{123}-\\alpha_{123}^{0})^{2}$\n- $E_{\\mathrm{angle}}(2,3,4) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{234}(\\alpha_{234}-\\alpha_{234}^{0})^{2}$\n- $E_{\\mathrm{dihedral}}(1,2,3,4) = \\sum_{m=1}^{p}\\frac{V_{m}}{2}\\left[1+\\cos\\!\\left(m\\,\\phi_{1234}-\\gamma_{m}\\right)\\right]$\n\nThe total residual contribution from these boundary-straddling terms is their sum:\n$$E_{\\text{residual}} = \\frac{1}{2}k_{12}(r_{12}-r_{12}^{0})^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}k_{34}(r_{34}-r_{34}^{0})^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}k_{123}(\\alpha_{123}-\\alpha_{123}^{0})^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}k_{234}(\\alpha_{234}-\\alpha_{234}^{0})^{2} + \\sum_{m=1}^{p}\\frac{V_{m}}{2}\\left[1+\\cos\\!\\left(m\\,\\phi_{1234}-\\gamma_{m}\\right)\\right]$$\nThis is the analytic expression required.\n\nThe second part of the question requires an identification and explanation of conditions under which cancellation is incomplete in more general subtractive QM/MM schemes. The derivation above assumes a very simple model where cancellation is perfect. In realistic applications, this is often not the case due to several factors.\n\n1.  **Capping/Link-Atom Modifications:** When a covalent bond is cut at the QM/MM boundary (here, the $1$-$2$ and $3$-$4$ bonds), the valency of the boundary QM atoms ($2$ and $3$) is left unsaturated. This is unphysical for the QM calculation. To remedy this, a \"link atom\" (typically hydrogen, $H$) is added to cap the dangling bond, creating a more realistic chemical environment for the QM calculation. For our system, one might cap atom $2$ with a link atom $H_{L1}$ and atom $3$ with $H_{L2}$. The QM calculation and the subtraction term are then performed on this modified QM subsystem, $Q' = \\{H_{L1}, 2, 3, H_{L2}\\}$.\n    The hybrid energy expression becomes $E_{\\mathrm{QM/MM}} = E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M) - E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q') + E_{\\mathrm{QM}}(Q')$. The key issue is that $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q')$ is not a simple subset of the terms in $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M)$. For example, $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M)$ contains the angle term $E_{\\mathrm{angle}}(1,2,3)$, which depends on atom $1$. The subtraction term $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q')$ contains a corresponding angle term $E_{\\mathrm{angle}}(H_{L1},2,3)$, which depends on the link atom $H_{L1}$. These two terms involve different atoms and likely different force field parameters ($k_{123}$ vs. $k_{H_{L1},2,3}$). They do not cancel. This mismatch introduces artifacts at the boundary, as the subtraction is no longer clean. The scheme relies on the hope that $E_{\\mathrm{QM}}(Q')$ implicitly captures the effects of the atom-$1$ environment, but the imperfect subtraction of the MM terms pollutes the energy and forces.\n\n2.  **Multi-atom Cross-Boundary Couplings and Non-additive Forms:** Many modern force fields are not strictly pairwise additive and include cross-terms that couple different internal coordinates, such as bond-angle or angle-angle terms. Consider a hypothetical term $E_{\\mathrm{cross}} = k_{\\mathrm{cross}}(\\alpha_{123}-\\alpha_{123}^0)(\\alpha_{234}-\\alpha_{234}^0)$. This term is part of $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q+M)$ and straddles the boundary. When constructing $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q)$ (or $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q')$ with link atoms), such a term cannot be formed as it requires atoms from both sides of the boundary simultaneously. It thus remains after subtraction, similar to other boundary terms. The more subtle problem arises when a term formally exists in both the full system and the subsystem calculation, but its parameters are context-dependent. For instance, if the force constant $k_{23}$ of the central bond depends on the chemical environment (e.g., through a bond-order formalism), its value in the full system ($Q+M$) might differ from its value in the capped subsystem ($Q'$). This would lead to incomplete cancellation even for a term like $E_{\\mathrm{bond}}(2,3)$, i.e., $E_{\\mathrm{bond}}(2,3)|_{Q+M} \\neq E_{\\mathrm{bond}}(2,3)|_{Q'}$.\n\n3.  **Topology-Dependent Parameters:** Partial atomic charges in MM force fields are another source of incomplete cancellation. In a simple scheme, atom $2$ has a charge $q_2$ in all calculations. However, if charges are determined by algorithms that are sensitive to the overall molecular topology, the charge $q_2$ calculated for the full system $Q+M$ may differ from the charge assigned to atom $2$ in the isolated subsystem $Q'$. The electrostatic interaction energy terms involving atom $2$ would then fail to cancel properly, leading to errors. This highlights a fundamental weakness of subtractive schemes: they implicitly assume that force field terms are perfectly transferable between the full system and the artificially constructed subsystem, an assumption that frequently breaks down at the boundary.",

This practice explores how the choices made when partitioning the system—specifically the size of the QM region and the type of embedding—propagate into the calculated potential energy surface . By constructing and analyzing a one-dimensional model, you will gain direct insight into the sensitivity of reaction barriers and forces to the fundamental parameters of the subtractive scheme.",

            "problem": "You are asked to construct and analyze a one-dimensional model of a subtractive Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) scheme along a reaction coordinate. The goal is to isolate and quantify the effect of changing the Quantum Mechanics (QM) region fraction and the embedding scheme on the subtractive energy, denoted $E_{\\text{sub}}(s)$, and on the forces along the reaction coordinate, denoted $F_{\\text{sub}}(s)$. The reaction coordinate is a single scalar $s$ in units of ångström ($\\text{\\AA}$). All energies are in kilojoule per mole ($\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$) and forces in $\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-1}$.\n\nFundamental base and modeling assumptions:\n- Begin from energy additivity and region partitioning: a system is partitioned into a QM subregion and its Molecular Mechanics (MM) environment. Avoid double counting when combining region contributions.\n- Forces are defined by $F(s) = -\\frac{d E(s)}{d s}$, where $E(s)$ is an energy function of $s$.\n- The embedding modifies the energy of the QM subregion depending on the environment in a way consistent with standard mechanical and electrostatic embedding concepts: mechanical embedding leaves the QM Hamiltonian unaffected by the MM environment; electrostatic embedding adds a term from the environment field acting on the QM subregion.\n\nModel definitions to be used:\n- Let the MM energy of the entire system be modeled by\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{MM,tot}}(s; f) = A_{\\mathrm{MM}}\\, s^4 - B_{\\mathrm{MM}}\\, s^2 + (1 - f)\\, \\chi_{\\mathrm{MM,tot}}\\, E_0\\, s,\n$$\nwhere $f \\in [0,1]$ is the fraction (by weight or proxy) of the system treated at the QM level.\n- Let the MM energy assigned to the atoms that comprise the QM subregion (when those QM atoms are instead described at the MM level) be\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{MM,Q}}(s; f) = f\\left[A_{\\mathrm{MM}}\\, s^4 - B_{\\mathrm{MM}}\\, s^2\\right] + f(1 - f)\\, \\chi_{\\mathrm{MM}}\\, E_0\\, s.\n$$\n- Let the baseline isolated QM energy for the QM subregion be\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{QM,base}}(s; f) = f\\left[A_{\\mathrm{QM}}\\, s^4 - B_{\\mathrm{QM}}\\, s^2\\right].\n$$\n- Let the electrostatic embedding contribution to the QM subregion be\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{embed}}(s; f) = f(1 - f)\\, \\chi_{\\mathrm{QM}}\\, E_0\\, s.\n$$\n- Mechanical embedding uses $E_{\\mathrm{QM,base}}(s; f)$ without $E_{\\mathrm{embed}}(s; f)$. Electrostatic embedding adds $E_{\\mathrm{embed}}(s; f)$ to $E_{\\mathrm{QM,base}}(s; f)$.\n\nDerivation and computation tasks:\n- Using energy additivity and removal of double counting, derive the subtractive QM/MM total energy $E_{\\text{sub}}(s)$ for the two embedding schemes: mechanical embedding and electrostatic embedding. The derivation must start from the above definitions and the principle that the MM description of the QM subregion must be removed once the QM description is added.\n- Compute, over a uniformly spaced grid $s \\in [s_{\\min}, s_{\\max}]$, the barrier height $\\Delta E$ of $E_{\\text{sub}}(s)$, defined as $\\Delta E = \\max_s E_{\\text{sub}}(s) - \\min_s E_{\\text{sub}}(s)$.\n- Compute the force along the coordinate for both embeddings as $F_{\\text{sub}}(s) = -\\frac{d E_{\\text{sub}}}{d s}$, and quantify the force sensitivity by the root-mean-square (RMS) difference $D_F = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(F_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{EE}}(s_i) - F_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{ME}}(s_i)\\right)^2}$, where $N$ is the number of grid points and the superscripts indicate electrostatic embedding (EE) and mechanical embedding (ME).\n- For each test case, report four quantities:\n    1. $b_{\\mathrm{ME}}$: barrier height $\\Delta E$ for mechanical embedding in $\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$,\n    2. $b_{\\mathrm{EE}}$: barrier height $\\Delta E$ for electrostatic embedding in $\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$,\n    3. $\\delta_b$: difference $\\delta_b = b_{\\mathrm{EE}} - b_{\\mathrm{ME}}$ in $\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$,\n    4. $D_F$: RMS force difference in $\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-1}$.\n- All reported numerical outputs must be rounded to $5$ decimal places.\n\nParameters and units:\n- Use $A_{\\mathrm{MM}} = 10\\, \\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-4}$, $B_{\\mathrm{MM}} = 20\\, \\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-2}$, $A_{\\mathrm{QM}} = 12\\, \\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-4}$, $B_{\\mathrm{QM}} = 24\\, \\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-2}$, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{MM,tot}} = 1.0$, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{MM}} = 0.8$, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{QM}} = 1.2$.\n- Use $s_{\\min} = -1.5\\, \\text{\\AA}$, $s_{\\max} = 1.5\\, \\text{\\AA}$, and a uniform grid of $N = 2001$ points.\n- The environment scaling $E_0$ is case-dependent, see the test suite below.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$: $f = 0.2$, $E_0 = 5.0$.\n- Case $2$: $f = 0.5$, $E_0 = 5.0$.\n- Case $3$ (boundary, no QM region): $f = 0.0$, $E_0 = 5.0$.\n- Case $4$ (boundary, full QM region): $f = 1.0$, $E_0 = 5.0$.\n- Case $5$ (stronger environment): $f = 0.7$, $E_0 = 10.0$.\n\nAngle units do not apply because the coordinate is linear. Energies must be expressed in $\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$ and forces in $\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-1}$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. The output must be a list of lists, one inner list per test case, and each inner list must be $[b_{\\mathrm{ME}}, b_{\\mathrm{EE}}, \\delta_b, D_F]$ with all values rounded to $5$ decimal places. For example, an output with two hypothetical cases would look like \"[[1.23456,2.34567,1.11111,0.01234],[...]]\" but with the actual computed values for the five cases above.",
            "solution": "The user has provided a well-defined computational problem in the domain of multiscale modeling. The problem statement is scientifically sound, self-contained, and algorithmically tractable. The validation shows no flaws. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe core of this problem is to formalize and analyze a one-dimensional subtractive Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) model. The total energy of the system, $E_{\\text{sub}}(s)$, is constructed based on the principle of energy additivity, where double-counting of the energy of the QM region is explicitly removed. The subtractive scheme is formally expressed as:\n$$\nE_{\\text{sub}} = E_{\\text{MM, total system}} + (E_{\\text{QM, embedded QM region}} - E_{\\text{MM, QM region atoms}})\n$$\nThis formula states that the total QM/MM energy is the energy of the entire system calculated with the less accurate method (MM), plus a correction term. This correction term is the difference between the energy of the QM region calculated with the more accurate method (QM) and the energy of the same region calculated with the less accurate method (MM).\n\nUsing the notation provided in the problem statement, this becomes:\n$$\nE_{\\text{sub}}(s; f) = E_{\\mathrm{MM,tot}}(s; f) + E_{\\mathrm{QM}}(s; f) - E_{\\mathrm{MM,Q}}(s; f)\n$$\nHere, $E_{\\mathrm{QM}}(s; f)$ represents the energy of the quantum mechanical region, and its definition depends on the chosen embedding scheme.\n\n**1. Derivation of Subtractive Energy for Mechanical Embedding (ME)**\n\nIn mechanical embedding, the QM subregion is treated as an isolated quantum system. Its Hamiltonian is not influenced by the electrostatic field of the surrounding MM atoms. Therefore, the energy of the QM region is given by its baseline energy, $E_{\\mathrm{QM,base}}(s; f)$.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{QM}}^{\\mathrm{ME}}(s; f) = E_{\\mathrm{QM,base}}(s; f) = f\\left[A_{\\mathrm{QM}}\\, s^4 - B_{\\mathrm{QM}}\\, s^2\\right]\n$$\nThe total subtractive energy for the ME scheme is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{ME}}(s; f) = E_{\\mathrm{MM,tot}}(s; f) + E_{\\mathrm{QM,base}}(s; f) - E_{\\mathrm{MM,Q}}(s; f)\n$$\nSubstituting the given model definitions:\n$$\nE_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{ME}}(s; f) = \\left(A_{\\mathrm{MM}} s^4 - B_{\\mathrm{MM}} s^2 + (1 - f) \\chi_{\\mathrm{MM,tot}} E_0 s\\right) + \\left(f[A_{\\mathrm{QM}} s^4 - B_{\\mathrm{QM}} s^2]\\right) - \\left(f[A_{\\mathrm{MM}} s^4 - B_{\\mathrm{MM}} s^2] + f(1 - f) \\chi_{\\mathrm{MM}} E_0 s\\right)\n$$\nGrouping terms by powers of the reaction coordinate $s$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{ME}}(s; f) = (A_{\\mathrm{MM}}(1-f) + f A_{\\mathrm{QM}}) s^4 - (B_{\\mathrm{MM}}(1-f) + f B_{\\mathrm{QM}}) s^2 + \\left((1 - f) \\chi_{\\mathrm{MM,tot}} - f(1 - f) \\chi_{\\mathrm{MM}}\\right) E_0 s\n$$\nTo simplify, let us define effective parameters:\n$A_{\\text{eff}}(f) = A_{\\mathrm{MM}}(1-f) + f A_{\\mathrm{QM}}$\n$B_{\\text{eff}}(f) = B_{\\mathrm{MM}}(1-f) + f B_{\\mathrm{QM}}$\n$C_{\\text{ME}}(f, E_0) = (1-f)(\\chi_{\\mathrm{MM,tot}} - f\\chi_{\\mathrm{MM}}) E_0$\nThen the energy is succinctly written as:\n$$\nE_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{ME}}(s; f) = A_{\\text{eff}}(f) s^4 - B_{\\text{eff}}(f) s^2 + C_{\\text{ME}}(f, E_0) s\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of Subtractive Energy for Electrostatic Embedding (EE)**\n\nIn electrostatic embedding, the QM subregion's Hamiltonian includes one-electron operators that represent the electrostatic potential from the MM environment's partial charges. The model captures this by adding an embedding energy term, $E_{\\mathrm{embed}}(s; f)$, to the baseline QM energy.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{QM}}^{\\mathrm{EE}}(s; f) = E_{\\mathrm{QM,base}}(s; f) + E_{\\mathrm{embed}}(s; f) = f\\left[A_{\\mathrm{QM}} s^4 - B_{\\mathrm{QM}} s^2\\right] + f(1 - f) \\chi_{\\mathrm{QM}} E_0 s\n$$\nThe total subtractive energy for the EE scheme is therefore the ME energy plus the embedding term:\n$$\nE_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{EE}}(s; f) = E_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{ME}}(s; f) + E_{\\mathrm{embed}}(s; f)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_{\\mathrm{embed}}(s; f)$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{EE}}(s; f) = A_{\\text{eff}}(f) s^4 - B_{\\text{eff}}(f) s^2 + C_{\\text{ME}}(f, E_0) s + f(1 - f) \\chi_{\\mathrm{QM}} E_0 s\n$$\nThe linear term's coefficient is modified. We define a new effective parameter $C_{\\text{EE}}(f, E_0)$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{EE}}(f, E_0) = C_{\\text{ME}}(f, E_0) + f(1-f)\\chi_{\\mathrm{QM}}E_0 = (1-f)(\\chi_{\\mathrm{MM,tot}} - f\\chi_{\\mathrm{MM}} + f\\chi_{\\mathrm{QM}}) E_0\n$$\nThus, the energy for the EE scheme is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{EE}}(s; f) = A_{\\text{eff}}(f) s^4 - B_{\\text{eff}}(f) s^2 + C_{\\text{EE}}(f, E_0) s\n$$\n\n**3. Barrier Height Calculation**\n\nThe barrier height, $\\Delta E$, is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum energy values over the specified range of the coordinate $s$, from $s_{\\min} = -1.5\\,\\text{\\AA}$ to $s_{\\max} = 1.5\\,\\text{\\AA}$.\n$$\n\\Delta E = \\max_{s \\in [s_{\\min}, s_{\\max}]} E_{\\text{sub}}(s) - \\min_{s \\in [s_{\\min}, s_{\\max}]} E_{\\text{sub}}(s)\n$$\nThis calculation will be performed numerically by evaluating the energy functions $E_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{ME}}(s)$ and $E_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{EE}}(s)$ on a fine uniform grid of $N=2001$ points and finding the minimum and maximum values in the resulting arrays. The barrier heights for mechanical ($b_{\\mathrm{ME}}$) and electrostatic ($b_{\\mathrm{EE}}$) embedding are computed from their respective energy functions. The difference is $\\delta_b = b_{\\mathrm{EE}} - b_{\\mathrm{ME}}$.\n\n**4. Force Derivation and RMS Difference ($D_F$)**\n\nForces are the negative gradient of the potential energy with respect to the coordinate: $F(s) = -dE(s)/ds$. Applying this to our energy functions:\n$$\nF_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{ME}}(s; f) = - \\frac{d}{ds} E_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{ME}}(s; f) = -4 A_{\\text{eff}}(f) s^3 + 2 B_{\\text{eff}}(f) s - C_{\\text{ME}}(f, E_0)\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{EE}}(s; f) = - \\frac{d}{ds} E_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{EE}}(s; f) = -4 A_{\\text{eff}}(f) s^3 + 2 B_{\\text{eff}}(f) s - C_{\\text{EE}}(f, E_0)\n$$\nThe difference between the forces for the two embedding schemes is:\n$$\n\\Delta F(s) = F_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{EE}}(s; f) - F_{\\text{sub}}^{\\mathrm{ME}}(s; f) = \\left(-C_{\\text{EE}}(f, E_0)\\right) - \\left(-C_{\\text{ME}}(f, E_0)\\right) = C_{\\text{ME}}(f, E_0) - C_{\\text{EE}}(f, E_0)\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions for $C_{\\text{ME}}$ and $C_{\\text{EE}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta F = -f(1-f)\\chi_{\\mathrm{QM}}E_0\n$$\nThis force difference, $\\Delta F$, is constant for all values of $s$. The root-mean-square (RMS) force difference, $D_F$, simplifies significantly:\n$$\nD_F = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(\\Delta F\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\cdot N (\\Delta F)^2} = |\\Delta F|\n$$\nSince $f \\in [0,1]$, $E_0 \\ge 0$, and $\\chi_{\\mathrm{QM}} > 0$, the term $f(1-f)\\chi_{\\mathrm{QM}}E_0$ is always non-negative.\n$$\nD_F = f(1-f)\\chi_{\\mathrm{QM}}E_0\n$$\nThis analytical result allows for direct calculation of $D_F$ without needing to evaluate forces on the grid.\n\nThe computational implementation will follow these derived formulas to calculate the four required quantities ($b_{\\mathrm{ME}}$, $b_{\\mathrm{EE}}$, $\\delta_b$, $D_F$) for each test case specified.",
